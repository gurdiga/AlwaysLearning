<div id="ygrps-yiv-1166845297">Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry I haven&#39;t been contributing much at all here but I am SO enjoying reading what you all have to say and think it&#39;s all fantastic.<br/>
<br/>
I have one lingering thought that keeps trickling into my brain often, about TV and self-regulation. I was wondering if I could share it hear and gain some feedback on what you all think about it.<br/>
 <br/>
I hear what radical unschoolers say and feel about TV and computers (no limits - total self-regulation). I&#39;m just wondering though, how do you all feel about the physical side of what TV/computers can do eg: the damage from rays, the damage to eyes and brain development in young children. There&#39;s a lot of info out there on that as well. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just finding it so confusing. On the one hand I totally agree with self-regulation in all areas of life but then, at the back of my mind is this concern for my child&#39;s health.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d really value what you guys think about this health stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much and so sorry to be wanting something without giving very much (I guess I&#39;m still really learning so much).<br/>

If you think of your children as making thoughtful choices all along  <br/>
the way, that&#39;s better than waiting for them to &quot;self regulate.&quot;    <br/>
There&#39;s a green box down on this page <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/rules">http://sandradodd.com/rules</a>  <br/>
about the idea of self regulation.<br/>

<br/>
How close are you sitting to your computer?<br/>
Have you been outside without sunscreen and a hat lately?<br/>
<br/>
The damage to eyes and brain development is, as far as I can tell,  <br/>
total bullshit.  Honestly.  Reading flat books (and flat computer  <br/>
screens) seems to be harmful to eyes too, or at least unnatural, in  <br/>
that eyes are designed for depth perception.  When I go outside to  <br/>
gather wood or collect seeds sometimes, if I&#39;ve been reading a lot  <br/>
just before, I have to consciously stretch my eyes, and think and  <br/>
concentrate to come back to looking with depth instead of just at the  <br/>
surface of the vines or the woodpile.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I&#39;m just finding it so confusing. On the one hand I totally agree  <br/>
with self-regulation in all areas of life but then, at the back of my  <br/>
mind is this concern for my child&#39;s health-=-<br/>
<br/>
In general, our culture likes to make children small.  And in  <br/>
general, our culture likes to encourage adults to keep children  <br/>
down.  So I question anything that says &quot;children shouldn&#39;t do this&quot;  <br/>
or that.  When I was little we were told drinking coffee would stunt  <br/>
our growth.  I think it was really that coffee was expensive and  <br/>
adults didn&#39;t want to share it, and didn&#39;t want to stimulate their  <br/>
kids.  That still goes on, with people wanting to limit foods so kids  <br/>
don&#39;t &quot;get hyper.&quot;  That&#39;s a way of controlling them biochemically,  <br/>
isn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
Oh!  Keith said he read that the U.S. Army (I think he said) won&#39;t  <br/>
take someone who has taken psychoactive drugs within the past year  <br/>
(when they go to enlist) and that includes Ritalin.<br/>
<br/>
I let my kids know what effect different foods might have, as far as  <br/>
I know.  I try to be very careful not to make absolute statements or  <br/>
to say anything that will turn out not to be true.  Holly drinks Red  <br/>
Bull sometimes.  Sometimes if one is sick I&#39;ll remind them that juice  <br/>
and broth/soup are thought to be better than milk products for people  <br/>
who are having sinus and mucus situation.  If they&#39;re &quot;irregular&quot; one  <br/>
way or the other I&#39;ll point out foods we have that might help or  <br/>
hurt.  I don&#39;t tell them what to eat.  I help them make better  <br/>
decisions.<br/>
<br/>
Last night Marty was playing a video game he&#39;s only owned since  <br/>
Tuesday afternoon.  He&#39;s working full time, and when he came back  <br/>
yesterday Kirby was already playing the game and he waited a while.   <br/>
It&#39;s called Oblivion.<br/>
<br/>
At about 8:00 he came where I was and said he wanted to keep playing  <br/>
his game, but he needed to go to sleep.  I asked whether he couldn&#39;t  <br/>
play for another hour and then get by on 8 and a half hours of  <br/>
sleep.  He said he *could* but he woudn&#39;t feel as good the next day.<br/>
<br/>
This kid who was allowed to stay up late or go to bed either one, now  <br/>
that he goes to work at 6:30, tries to sleep ten hours a night.   <br/>
Nobody &quot;makes&quot; him.  He decides each night based on how he feels, how  <br/>
hard that day was and how alert he needs to be the next day.   That&#39;s  <br/>
not &quot;self regulation,&quot; though.  It&#39;s thoughtful decisionmaking, and  <br/>
it&#39;s the way people can be in the absence of being controlled,  <br/>
shamed, manipulated or scared.  WEIRD.  I would never have expected  <br/>
it as a byproduct of unschooling.  I, who was told when to go to  <br/>
sleep and when to wake up, feel that I&#39;ve really won something if I  <br/>
stay up really late, and I&#39;m WAY grown up.  I sleep or wake with  <br/>
little voices leftover in my head about &quot;should&quot; and &quot;can&quot; and &quot;can&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think many &quot;studies&quot; are really justifications for controlling kids.<br/>

We don&#39;t watch much tv and do limit it for our kids.  My oldest who is now 7 <br/>
has lazy eye which was diagnosed at 4 months old.  She&#39;s worn glasses, <br/>
patched and done vision therapy since she was about 18 months.   According <br/>
to the eye doctors we&#39;ve been to and our own research, tv is passive and her <br/>
eye needs (extra) stimulation.  So alot of tv at the age of her eyes <br/>
developing (up until around age 9-12) could be harmful in the sense that she <br/>
would use her strong eye to watch tv and not use her lazy eye which would <br/>
shut down and could lead to lost vision/blindness in her lazy eye.  Even if <br/>
she didn&#39;t have a vision problem I would likely continue to limit tv.  We <br/>
don&#39;t have video games either but the same would be true RE: my dd&#39;s vision. <br/>
I know its not considered  unschooling - but its a choice we&#39;ve made and <br/>
live fine with.  I&#39;ve also read The Plug in Drug and Four Reasons for the <br/>
Elimination of Television which have had an impact on our tv limits.<br/>

<br/>
TV watching is much less passive than book reading.<br/>
When a kid is thinking, and interested, and taking in information,  <br/>
that&#39;s not passive.  When a kid is up and dancing and singing and  <br/>
discussing what&#39;s on with the others (sometimes we can&#39;t WAIT for a  <br/>
commercial, which gives us a minute or two to discuss why and what  <br/>
if, when we&#39;re watching 24 or Desperate Housewives, and when it&#39;s a  <br/>
tape or DVD, we pause it LOTS, or wind back the good parts or places  <br/>
that confuse us).<br/>
<br/>

MILLIONS of families limit TV.  Here are some arguments against limits:<br/>

If the goal is learning and real choices, parentally imposed limits  <br/>
are limiting.  They limit learning.<br/>

lazy eye is 98% better. He swears it is the video games that helped <br/>
him pull that eye in on a regular basis.  I have no idea, but trust <br/>
his perception on it. <br/>
<br/>
Like I said he is a huge tv fan. Probably most of his information on <br/>
the world is gathered from the tv. He gives me interesting facts <br/>
from all of his shows constantly. <br/>
<br/>
He does not enjoy reading, other than some magazines, but that kid <br/>
is very knowledgable about many, many subjects from his love of TV.<br/>

Just sharing another viewpoint.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-270833052">Thank you SO much Sandra! I think, deep down, I needed to hear this to allow me to &#39;free&#39; up my own head stuff about the TV thing. <br/>
<br/>
I am pretty &#39;organic&#39; when it comes to food and skin products bla bla and as much as I can be with as much of my life as possible BUT I know this world is full of stuff that we do that can cause us problems etc. and to try to aviod every little thing will cause cancer!! I don&#39;t know why I was still stuck on this TV/computer rays thing but it&#39;s one that kept lingering in my mind. It&#39;s so hard siffering through info trying to find what&#39;s right etc ( and then, right for WHO??). The whole vaccination controversy, sun screen, organic food versers GM foods, chemically based skin products and more organic ones. Arrrgghhh! I run myself silly somtimes with it all.<br/>
<br/>
I love the learning that takes place for me here, at this group - it&#39;s like, I can exhale and let go. Breathe better or something.<br/>
<br/>
Aaaahhhh...<br/>

thanks so much.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1836421126">Thanks Dawn. This sort of literature is what affects me and my ideas about TV. But, I keep coming back to the fact that if we are limiting our children then are we really allowing them to regulate for themselves? I don&#39;t want to stifle my son&#39;s inate ability to determine for himself what he needs and when but then I constantly battle with info that looks at danger/damage etc and I think, Aaagghhh!!<br/>

  We don&#39;t watch much tv and do limit it for our kids.  My oldest who is now 7 <br/>
  has lazy eye which was diagnosed at 4 months old.  She&#39;s worn glasses, <br/>
  patched and done vision therapy since she was about 18 months.   According <br/>
  to the eye doctors we&#39;ve been to and our own research, tv is passive and her <br/>
  eye needs (extra) stimulation.  So alot of tv at the age of her eyes <br/>
  developing (up until around age 9-12) could be harmful in the sense that she <br/>
  would use her strong eye to watch tv and not use her lazy eye which would <br/>
  shut down and could lead to lost vision/blindness in her lazy eye.  Even if <br/>
  she didn&#39;t have a vision problem I would likely continue to limit tv.  We <br/>
  don&#39;t have video games either but the same would be true RE: my dd&#39;s vision. <br/>
  I know its not considered  unschooling - but its a choice we&#39;ve made and <br/>
  live fine with.  I&#39;ve also read The Plug in Drug and Four Reasons for the <br/>
  Elimination of Television which have had an impact on our tv limits.<br/>

  Subject: [AlwaysLearning] a question about TV<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; Hi there,<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; I&#39;m sorry I haven&#39;t been contributing much at all here but I am SO <br/>
  &gt; enjoying reading what you all have to say and think it&#39;s all fantastic.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; I have one lingering thought that keeps trickling into my brain often, <br/>
  &gt; about TV and self-regulation. I was wondering if I could share it hear and <br/>
  &gt; gain some feedback on what you all think about it.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; I hear what radical unschoolers say and feel about TV and computers (no <br/>
  &gt; limits - total self-regulation). I&#39;m just wondering though, how do you all <br/>
  &gt; feel about the physical side of what TV/computers can do eg: the damage <br/>
  &gt; from rays, the damage to eyes and brain development in young children. <br/>
  &gt; There&#39;s a lot of info out there on that as well.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; I&#39;m just finding it so confusing. On the one hand I totally agree with <br/>
  &gt; self-regulation in all areas of life but then, at the back of my mind is <br/>
  &gt; this concern for my child&#39;s health.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; I&#39;d really value what you guys think about this health stuff.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; Thanks so much and so sorry to be wanting something without giving very <br/>
  &gt; much (I guess I&#39;m still really learning so much).<br/>
  &gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-245171294">I used to worry about my son watching too much TV when we first<br/>
started unschooling after him being in kindergarten for half a year. I<br/>
think one of the best things we did concerning TV viewing was to give<br/>
him his own VCR with pleanty of blank tapes (and help him use them of<br/>
course.) He&#39;s now just turned 8 and has free use of TV, computer with<br/>
internet (we use favorites to help him get back to the places he<br/>
likes, help him make a list of his passwords), PS2 (use memory cards),<br/>
all the books in the house (we real bookmarks for these) , etc. and<br/>
has had for a few years now and I feel he uses them all to his advantage. <br/>
    Why I mention the bookmarks and VHS tapes is becuase it gives him<br/>
even MORE control over these things in that he can start and stop them<br/>
when he needs to, or get back to a website, or the same spot in a<br/>
game, etc. So if something else comes up that he feels is of interest<br/>
to him then he doesn&#39;t feel like he will miss out on something else.<br/>
So even if there is a really interesting episode of Teen Titans on TV<br/>
he can still go to the park and not worry about missing anything<br/>
because he can watch the tape when he gets back home, if that&#39;s his<br/>
choice. It EMPOWERS him. Yes there are times when you have to make a<br/>
choice about things, but life is already so full of choices it helps<br/>
to have some control. <br/>
    Before he had this empowerment perhaps he would watch 6 hours of<br/>
TV just so he wouldn&#39;t miss his favorite hour show, now if he records<br/>
it he can skip through the stuff he&#39;s not interested in, or he could<br/>
not watch it for weeks while he explores a new book or video game. He<br/>
spends time doing what he is interested in, not what&#39;s dictated by the<br/>
TV lineup, not watching TV just becuase he feels it may soon be yanked<br/>
away and he should watch as much of it as he can while he has it. <br/>
    This type of thinking also can crossover into othre areas of life.<br/>
I also help empower my son to not overeat. I know this may sould a<br/>
little weird but when he was age 4/5 and we went to Fazoli&#39;s he would<br/>
literally eat breadsticks until he would vomit because he liked them<br/>
SO much and it was so rare he got them! So now we figure out together<br/>
an amount that we can both agree on (say 2 1/2 breadsticks) with the<br/>
meal and then save another amount that we agree on (Say 2 more) away<br/>
for a later time like the next day. Perhaps we could make plans to eat<br/>
there more often or learn how to make breadsticks at home. Really I<br/>
never thought my son so deprived that he would feel he needed to hoard<br/>
food of any kind (never has he gone hungry) but obviously he felt<br/>
differently, so I tried to see how he felt and gave him more control<br/>
over the situation. He is now becoming more flexable in many areas! I<br/>
feel lots of communication and empowerment are great things in a happy<br/>
family. I&#39;m going back to quietly lurking and learning now ~ Barbara<br/>

 <br/>
I have 3 children who used to wear glasses full time, but now only 1  still <br/>
wears contacts, and the other 2 need them just for reading.  I  never *made* <br/>
them wear their glasses when they were supposed to be wearing them  full time, <br/>
and they chose not to most of the time.  So I would probably be  considered a <br/>
bad parent for not insisting they wear them.  <br/>
 <br/>
But possibly, because they didn&#39;t wear them all the time, their eyes  <br/>
strengthened, or changed, or &quot;grew&quot; maybe?  I don&#39;t know...But all  3 needed glasses <br/>
from the age of about 7 (bad eyes run in my husband&#39;s  family, lots of lazy <br/>
eye) and my daughter that still wears them had really bad  lazy eye when young <br/>
(we corrected it surgically.)<br/>

artificially big and wise.<br/>
Every &quot;no&quot; you say erodes the relationship between you and your child.<br/>
<br/>
How much &quot;no&quot; could you take from your husband before you either  <br/>
wanted to quit asking, or leave?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not about the level of restriction, it&#39;s about discovering that  <br/>
saying yes is more positive than saying no.<br/>
<br/>
If you withhold some of  your willingness to trust your child, your  <br/>
child is less trusted.<br/>
<br/>
Flat out, right there.  Not trusted.  Negativity.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/joyce/yes">http://sandradodd.com/joyce/yes</a><br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s part of what&#39;s on that page:<br/>
<br/>
**There&#39;s a lot of factors at play here.**<br/>
<br/>
If someone sees the situation between parent and child about  <br/>
maintaining control then there&#39;s a lot of factors.<br/>
<br/>
When the situation is seen as respect then most of the factors  <br/>
disappear.<br/>
<br/>
**When I do, I stick to it.**<br/>
<br/>
Even when you&#39;re wrong?<br/>
<br/>
**I think I&#39;m a dependable person to my kids that way.**<br/>
<br/>
I think it sounds rigid.<br/>
<br/>
Trust comes from following through on promises not from following  <br/>
through on whatever happens to come out of our mouths. My daughter --  <br/>
or any human for that matter -- doesn&#39;t trust me less if I say no and  <br/>
change it to yes. But she does trust me less if I say yes and change  <br/>
it to no.<br/>
<br/>
**How do I know when to say no**<br/>
<br/>
Don�t say no. Always say yes. Or some form of yes. See your role as  <br/>
helping her get what she needs rather than negotiating for what�s  <br/>
most convenient for you.<br/>
<br/>
Yes can come in all sorts of forms:<br/>
<br/>
�Yes, we can do that in 15 minutes when I�m done with this. If you�d  <br/>
like to help, I can be done even sooner.�<br/>
�Yes, you can buy that. Let�s think up ways you could save up or earn  <br/>
the money.�<br/>
�Yes, we can do that tomorrow morning because right now I�m about to  <br/>
drop from exhaustion.�<br/>
<br/>
**How do I know when to say no and when to let them decide.**<br/>
<br/>
The question is what&#39;s more important? Is your need to put the  <br/>
clothes away more important than a fun time spent playing with them?  <br/>
Think about the memories you&#39;re creating for your daughter: a  <br/>
knowledge that the summer clothes were put away in a timely manner or  <br/>
an hour spent pretending with them.<br/>
I�d go get the clothes and apologize for being mean and rude to her.  <br/>
Even if she�s a grudge holder and doesn�t want to play any more, the  <br/>
fact that you apologize will make a difference even if she doesn�t  <br/>
show it. It will let her know you recognize that her needs are  <br/>
important and that you didn�t treat them that way.<br/>
We can view children&#39;s needs as inconvenient for us or we can view  <br/>
them as people who need our help doing what they want to do.<br/>
<br/>
As an adult if I want to paint, I get out the paints. If want a Coke  <br/>
from the store, I get in the car and go. If I want to not cook  <br/>
dinner, I can order pizza.<br/>
<br/>
If I had to ask permission to use the paints, or ask my husband to  <br/>
drive me, or ask for money and convince him why it was a good idea to  <br/>
spend it how I wanted to then it would change our relationship  <br/>
knowing that he had the power to grant or deny my request based on  <br/>
*his* perception of what&#39;s important.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that he trusts me to make the decisions he would. It&#39;s that  <br/>
he trusts that I understand my own needs.<br/>
We can be our kids partner in helping them get what they want in life  <br/>
or we can be the barrier that opens or closes according to our whim.<br/>
<br/>
Our kids won&#39;t make the same choices we will. They don&#39;t have the  <br/>
same needs we do. If we want them to respect our needs then we need  <br/>
to offer them respect. We need to respect what *they* say is  <br/>
important, *not* what we judge to be important.<br/>
<br/>
Our kids are different people and they&#39;re not the age we are so their  <br/>
needs are different. It&#39;s not our job to train them to need what we  <br/>
need � they will have adult needs when they are of adult age � but to  <br/>
model how to respect others needs by respecting theirs.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s helpful is to recognize that what we think is important  <br/>
doesn&#39;t look important at all to kids. We can&#39;t make them understand  <br/>
how important it is. We can make them act as though they understand  <br/>
by making them comply with what we want. But that isn&#39;t respect.  <br/>
That&#39;s control.<br/>
<br/>
If we want them to respect needs they don&#39;t understand then we need  <br/>
to respect needs we don&#39;t understand. It won&#39;t be an equal give and  <br/>
take for years and years but eventually as the cognitive ability to  <br/>
understand someone&#39;s needs as separate from their own grows, as they  <br/>
build up a feeling of being respected, kids will offer in return what  <br/>
they&#39;re given.<br/>
<br/>

-=-And IMO its such a small issue, yet<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not a small issue, as it&#39;s the central issue involved in  <br/>
unschooling.  Do you believe that there are learning opportunities  <br/>
everywhere, and that children can continue to make connections their  <br/>
whole lives?<br/>
<br/>
If you believe they can learn history naturally, and grammar, but  <br/>
you&#39;re sure they couldn&#39;t learn math or reading, you don&#39;t believe  <br/>
and you don&#39;t trust.  If you think they can learn history/science/ <br/>
language/math naturally, but they can&#39;t learn whether they&#39;re sleepy  <br/>
or hungry or whether they like a food or don&#39;t, you&#39;re still  <br/>
reserving some things for which you will be the teacher because you  <br/>
don&#39;t trust their ability to learn and communicate.<br/>

One says, &#39;We don&#39;t do it that way&#39;, the other says &#39;That&#39;s the way we do <br/>

Anything you restrict in a rules-way makes your child small, and you<br/>
artificially big and wise.<br/>
Every &quot;no&quot; you say erodes the relationship between you and your child.<br/>
<br/>
How much &quot;no&quot; could you take from your husband before you either<br/>
wanted to quit asking, or leave?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not about the level of restriction, it&#39;s about discovering that<br/>
saying yes is more positive than saying no.<br/>
<br/>
If you withhold some of  your willingness to trust your child, your<br/>
child is less trusted.<br/>
<br/>
Flat out, right there.  Not trusted.  Negativity.<br/>

Here&#39;s part of what&#39;s on that page:<br/>
<br/>
**There&#39;s a lot of factors at play here.**<br/>
<br/>
If someone sees the situation between parent and child about<br/>
maintaining control then there&#39;s a lot of factors.<br/>
<br/>
When the situation is seen as respect then most of the factors<br/>
disappear.<br/>
<br/>
**When I do, I stick to it.**<br/>
<br/>
Even when you&#39;re wrong?<br/>
<br/>
**I think I&#39;m a dependable person to my kids that way.**<br/>
<br/>
I think it sounds rigid.<br/>
<br/>
Trust comes from following through on promises not from following<br/>
through on whatever happens to come out of our mouths. My daughter --<br/>
or any human for that matter -- doesn&#39;t trust me less if I say no and<br/>
change it to yes. But she does trust me less if I say yes and change<br/>
it to no.<br/>
<br/>
**How do I know when to say no**<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t say no. Always say yes. Or some form of yes. See your role as<br/>
helping her get what she needs rather than negotiating for what&#39;s<br/>
most convenient for you.<br/>
<br/>
Yes can come in all sorts of forms:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yes, we can do that in 15 minutes when I&#39;m done with this. If you&#39;d<br/>
like to help, I can be done even sooner.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Yes, you can buy that. Let&#39;s think up ways you could save up or earn<br/>
the money.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Yes, we can do that tomorrow morning because right now I&#39;m about to<br/>
drop from exhaustion.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
**How do I know when to say no and when to let them decide.**<br/>
<br/>
The question is what&#39;s more important? Is your need to put the<br/>
clothes away more important than a fun time spent playing with them?<br/>
Think about the memories you&#39;re creating for your daughter: a<br/>
knowledge that the summer clothes were put away in a timely manner or<br/>
an hour spent pretending with them.<br/>
I&#39;d go get the clothes and apologize for being mean and rude to her.<br/>
Even if she&#39;s a grudge holder and doesn&#39;t want to play any more, the<br/>
fact that you apologize will make a difference even if she doesn&#39;t<br/>
show it. It will let her know you recognize that her needs are<br/>
important and that you didn&#39;t treat them that way.<br/>
We can view children&#39;s needs as inconvenient for us or we can view<br/>
them as people who need our help doing what they want to do.<br/>
<br/>
As an adult if I want to paint, I get out the paints. If want a Coke<br/>
from the store, I get in the car and go. If I want to not cook<br/>
dinner, I can order pizza.<br/>
<br/>
If I had to ask permission to use the paints, or ask my husband to<br/>
drive me, or ask for money and convince him why it was a good idea to<br/>
spend it how I wanted to then it would change our relationship<br/>
knowing that he had the power to grant or deny my request based on<br/>
*his* perception of what&#39;s important.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that he trusts me to make the decisions he would. It&#39;s that<br/>
he trusts that I understand my own needs.<br/>
We can be our kids partner in helping them get what they want in life<br/>
or we can be the barrier that opens or closes according to our whim.<br/>
<br/>
Our kids won&#39;t make the same choices we will. They don&#39;t have the<br/>
same needs we do. If we want them to respect our needs then we need<br/>
to offer them respect. We need to respect what *they* say is<br/>
important, *not* what we judge to be important.<br/>
<br/>
Our kids are different people and they&#39;re not the age we are so their<br/>
needs are different. It&#39;s not our job to train them to need what we<br/>
need - they will have adult needs when they are of adult age - but to<br/>
model how to respect others needs by respecting theirs.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s helpful is to recognize that what we think is important<br/>
doesn&#39;t look important at all to kids. We can&#39;t make them understand<br/>
how important it is. We can make them act as though they understand<br/>
by making them comply with what we want. But that isn&#39;t respect.<br/>
That&#39;s control.<br/>
<br/>
If we want them to respect needs they don&#39;t understand then we need<br/>
to respect needs we don&#39;t understand. It won&#39;t be an equal give and<br/>
take for years and years but eventually as the cognitive ability to<br/>
understand someone&#39;s needs as separate from their own grows, as they<br/>
build up a feeling of being respected, kids will offer in return what<br/>
they&#39;re given.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not a small issue, as it&#39;s the central issue involved in<br/>
unschooling.  Do you believe that there are learning opportunities<br/>
everywhere, and that children can continue to make connections their<br/>
whole lives?<br/>
<br/>
If you believe they can learn history naturally, and grammar, but<br/>
you&#39;re sure they couldn&#39;t learn math or reading, you don&#39;t believe<br/>
and you don&#39;t trust.  If you think they can learn history/science/<br/>
language/math naturally, but they can&#39;t learn whether they&#39;re sleepy<br/>
or hungry or whether they like a food or don&#39;t, you&#39;re still<br/>
reserving some things for which you will be the teacher because you<br/>
don&#39;t trust their ability to learn and communicate.<br/>

doesn&#39;t feel the same to your daughter. Rules never feel the same to  <br/>
those who are in control as they do to those who are controlled by them.<br/>
<br/>
What if your husband read some studies that reading caused blindness  <br/>
that you thought were bogus? What if he would only allow you to read  <br/>
for 5 minutes a day and only those things he preapproved? *He* would  <br/>
feel it was working and *he* would feel relieved that he didn&#39;t have  <br/>
to worry about you going blind from reading. But how would it feel to  <br/>

<br/>
There have been several responses that are counter to your studies.  <br/>
If you choose out of fear to listen to the studies over the voices of  <br/>
unschooling experience that is your choice but limiting kids because  <br/>
of what a parent fears might happen is not going to help anyone  <br/>
unschool.<br/>
<br/>
Do ask what people&#39;s experiences are on the list. Do collect your own  <br/>
data and weigh it and assess it! :-) But offering a fear over  <br/>
experience as the basis of decision making isn&#39;t going to be helpful  <br/>
to unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-659504894">On Mar 24, 2006, at 6:35 AM, Nittany Lion quoted John Holt:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Except in rare times of great stress or danger, there is no reason  <br/>
&gt; why we<br/>
&gt; cannot say &#39;No&#39; to children in just as kind a way as we say &#39;Yes&#39;.  <br/>
&gt; Both are<br/>
&gt; words. Both convey ideas which even tiny children are smart enough  <br/>
&gt; to grasp.<br/>
&gt; One says, &#39;We don&#39;t do it that way&#39;, the other says &#39;That&#39;s the way  <br/>
&gt; we do<br/>
&gt; it&#39;. Most of the time, that is what children want to find out.  <br/>
&gt; Except when<br/>
&gt; overcome by fatigue, curiosity, or excitement, they want to do it  <br/>
&gt; right, do<br/>
&gt; as we do, fit in, take part.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You CAN say no in a kind way.  I think Holt was advising about not  <br/>
yelling or being mean unless the child&#39;s life was in danger.<br/>
<br/>
I say no to my kids lots.  I&#39;m not counting words.  But the no is  <br/>
usually in advisement, not in absolute limits, and there&#39;s a difference.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a guy who writes about how to be a parent who recommends  <br/>
&quot;vitamin N&quot; and said children should hear five &quot;no&#39;s&quot; for every two  <br/>
or three &quot;yes&#39;s&quot; (he WAS counting—anyone here remember the  <br/>
recommended proportion?)<br/>
<br/>
John Holt didn&#39;t like TV either, for himself, and figured no one else  <br/>
would like it either.  He probably quit watching it (if he ever did)  <br/>
when it was still in black and white, and he&#39;s been dead a long time,  <br/>
and he never had children.<br/>
<br/>
My children certainly DO want to find out about what they need to do  <br/>
to &quot;do it right&quot; and fit in.  When the boys went to their first  <br/>
funeral, when a friend&#39;s mother died, they were briefed and coached,  <br/>
partly by Holly who had been to two funerals with me.  They had seen  <br/>
some funerals on movies and TV, and that didn&#39;t hurt.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t begin to count the things my kids have learned from media— <br/>
internet, music, radio, television, movies, video, DVD, magazines,  <br/>
books.<br/>
<br/>
I really don&#39;t want to count.   I want their lives to be whole lives  <br/>
of respect and freedom.  One whole life.<br/>

trusting mothers&#39; reports of their real life experiences.  She has  <br/>
met dozens of the kids talked about here, hung out with them, seen  <br/>
them in their homes, had some in hers (Marty, Holly and I were  <br/>
fortunate to get to stay with Joyce for a few days and tourist in a  <br/>
place very exotic, for us).<br/>
<br/>
If any of us were just making this stuff up, the discussion would  <br/>
have died years and  years ago.  But this list is four and a half  <br/>
years old, and has grown steadily.   UnschoolingDiscussion is nearly  <br/>
seven years old.  Yesterday was the tenth anniversary of the first  <br/>
time I spoke in public.  Had I been full of shit, it wouldn&#39;t be  <br/>
worth mentioning; I woud&#39;ve never spoken again.  But usually when I  <br/>
go to a conference, at least one of my kids is there.  And when  <br/>
people really meet my kids and talk with them, their fears  <br/>
dissolve.   No one can meet my kids, or Pam&#39;s or Joyce&#39;s or those of  <br/>
many of the longtime unschoolers we&#39;ve met, learned from, helped  <br/>
along, and not KNOW that there&#39;s something to all of this.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something Holly, who is fourteen, posted on MySpace recently:<br/>
<br/>
Things to do when I get my braces off:<br/>
1. Have corn on the cob like all the time<br/>
2. Go to Shoney&#39;s and get like a ton of gum from their really cool  <br/>
25¢ gum machine<br/>
3. Eat carrots until my skin turns orange<br/>
<br/>
I put it up, with commentary, here: http://sandradodd.com/eating/balance<br/>
<br/>
Holly has had braces since she was twelve, and they come off soon.   <br/>
She&#39;s not pining for Jolly Ranchers or Tootsie Roll.  She misses  <br/>
whole carrots and corn on the cob. And she&#39;s had freedom to reject or  <br/>
choose foods her whole life.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not what mainstream &quot;common knowledge&quot; would predict.  Common  <br/>
knowledge encourages parents to make such absolute statements as these:<br/>
<br/>
They would spend all day, every day, in front of the the TV, computer  <br/>
or playstation if they were allowed to.<br/>
<br/>
If I I left him to his own plans, he would be playing the gameboy or  <br/>
watching TV all day long.<br/>
<br/>
Left to himself he would play Gamecube and torment his sister.<br/>
<br/>
My Mitchell (5) would watch it all day if I didn&#39;t say that&#39;s  <br/>
enough...get outside and play, now.<br/>
<br/>
I know if I let my son do ONLY what he wanted to do that is what he  <br/>
would choose. [of video games]<br/>
<br/>
If I let him do exactly what he wants he will just watch tv constantly.<br/>
<br/>
(More here:  http://sandradoddcom/ifilet )<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Holly, who&#39;s fourteen and longs for carrots, can watch TV or play  <br/>
games all day if she wants to.  She can watch R rated movies all she  <br/>
wants to.  She can rent them at the video place that&#39;s just a few  <br/>
hundred yards out our back gate.  I set their rental privileges to  <br/>
&quot;unlimited&quot; years ago.   Yesterday she watched The Lion King while  <br/>
she did cut-paper art, and then went and played Guitar Hero until her  <br/>
hand hurt, then talked to her brother a while and got in the hot tub  <br/>
with her dad.   You might be inclined not to believe me, but those  <br/>
who have met Holly or Kirby or Marty are glad to believe it.<br/>

people who have moved way beyond that theory and have years of  <br/>
experience showing how false it really is, the newcomer presenter  <br/>
will be challenged.<br/>
<br/>
There are groups where the other moms, who haven&#39;t thought that much  <br/>
about it either but are really glad there are a couple of aging books  <br/>
supporting their desire to control would say &quot;Oooooh, you&#39;re *such* a  <br/>
good MOM!&quot;   That might feel good for a minute.<br/>

We&#39;re trying to share something with you that could change your life  <br/>
and your children&#39;s lives and your lives together (family  <br/>
environment, relationships) phenomenally.   Take it or leave it.<br/>
<br/>
  My kids are bright, happy, responsible, whole and respected.  You  <br/>
can get in on that for free but we&#39;re not going to blow sunshine up  <br/>
behind you.   If your preferences are more important to you than your  <br/>
kids&#39; feelings and freedoms, you will find a lot of support in the  <br/>
world for controlling, belittling, and discounting children.  If you  <br/>
want something different, stick around.   Maybe check out  <br/>

P.S.  Kirby (19) is housesitting the dojo where he studies and  <br/>
teaches karate.  His teacher lives there, but is out of town for five  <br/>
days.  He also works today, mid-day.  He helped organize a birthday  <br/>
party for a friend for Saturday night, but yesterday he was telling  <br/>
Marty and Holly that he probably won&#39;t go to the party but will stay  <br/>
at the dojo.  If he does go, he said, it will be for just an hour or  <br/>
two.    I thought this Saturday was the day Marty (17) agreed to work  <br/>
someone else&#39;s shift, for overtime.  No, he said; that&#39;s April 1.<br/>
<br/>
What does any of that have to do with freedom to watch TV?<br/>
It&#39;s part of freedom to live, learn and grow in a safe, supportive  <br/>
environment, and the results are good.</div>

&gt;My husband and I can respectfully say &quot;no&quot; to each other without negative<br/>
&gt;connotation and with trust - is shows our boundaries without confusion.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>IMHO, using the word &#39;no&#39;, even when said nicely, doesn&#39;t help to clarify<br/>
and I think it can add confusion to a relationship.  When I started to say<br/>
&#39;yes&#39; more I started to notice that &#39;no&#39; felt like closing the door.  I<br/>
also find that when I say &#39;no&#39; I&#39;m not very connected w/ myself, and if I&#39;m<br/>
honest saying &#39;no&#39; is just a short cut for doing what I want or holding on<br/>
to a fear rather than  stretching myself and offering more to my<br/>
relationships. (Just to clarify, I&#39;m not talking about simple stuff like<br/>
&quot;would you like more potatoes?&quot; ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I prefer to convey additional information about what is really needed, to<br/>
offer an opportunity to connect and to share w/ the other person, or to<br/>
partner to find a way to say yes.  This isn&#39;t my experience when I say<br/>
&#39;no&#39;, that&#39;s more of a dead end.  And I&#39;ve also noticed that people often<br/>
hear the first thing that is said, so if I were to say &quot;No, that will be<br/>
too cold for me.  How about...&quot; we never really get to the &#39;how about&#39; part<br/>
because they are feeling the &#39;no&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Saying &#39;no&#39; is one way to honor a boundary, and it may be the only idea I<br/>
have at times, but these days I prefer to choose more and if &#39;no&#39; comes up<br/>
for me I use it as an opportunity to learn more about myself so I can move<br/>
beyond it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1282850347">Thanks for that lovely insight into your children, Sandra. It puts everything all right into perspective when we start talking about REAL people and putting the self-regulation and radical unschooling into the real world. I think people get bees in their bonnets (me included - very unfortunately) without knowing anyone that&#39;s lived a life like this. Society has such a hold on us all and we listen so hard to what &#39;other&#39; people say, believe and teach us that&#39;s it&#39;s really hard to go against the grain sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
But...thankfully, some of us are enlightened and find a better, more peaceful way to live and bring up our children. Thankfully some of us fall across an email list like this one and meet others, more experienced, who can guide us in a different way. Thankfully some of us stumble across beautiful parenting books and get a glimpse of the things we could do better for our precious children. Thankfully we can step aside from scoiety and do a little bit better.<br/>

  &gt; in terms of<br/>
  &gt; helping children I trust the real life experiences of unschoolers far<br/>
  &gt; more than I trust scientific studies done on (schooled) children<br/>
<br/>
  I want to point out that Joyce (and many others here) are not just  <br/>
  trusting mothers&#39; reports of their real life experiences.  She has  <br/>
  met dozens of the kids talked about here, hung out with them, seen  <br/>
  them in their homes, had some in hers (Marty, Holly and I were  <br/>
  fortunate to get to stay with Joyce for a few days and tourist in a  <br/>
  place very exotic, for us).<br/>
<br/>
  If any of us were just making this stuff up, the discussion would  <br/>
  have died years and  years ago.  But this list is four and a half  <br/>
  years old, and has grown steadily.   UnschoolingDiscussion is nearly  <br/>
  seven years old.  Yesterday was the tenth anniversary of the first  <br/>
  time I spoke in public.  Had I been full of shit, it wouldn&#39;t be  <br/>
  worth mentioning; I woud&#39;ve never spoken again.  But usually when I  <br/>
  go to a conference, at least one of my kids is there.  And when  <br/>
  people really meet my kids and talk with them, their fears  <br/>
  dissolve.   No one can meet my kids, or Pam&#39;s or Joyce&#39;s or those of  <br/>
  many of the longtime unschoolers we&#39;ve met, learned from, helped  <br/>
  along, and not KNOW that there&#39;s something to all of this.<br/>
<br/>
  Here&#39;s something Holly, who is fourteen, posted on MySpace recently:<br/>
<br/>
  Things to do when I get my braces off:<br/>
  1. Have corn on the cob like all the time<br/>
  2. Go to Shoney&#39;s and get like a ton of gum from their really cool  <br/>
  25¢ gum machine<br/>
  3. Eat carrots until my skin turns orange<br/>
<br/>
  I put it up, with commentary, here: http://sandradodd.com/eating/balance<br/>
<br/>
  Holly has had braces since she was twelve, and they come off soon.   <br/>
  She&#39;s not pining for Jolly Ranchers or Tootsie Roll.  She misses  <br/>
  whole carrots and corn on the cob. And she&#39;s had freedom to reject or  <br/>
  choose foods her whole life.<br/>
<br/>
  It&#39;s not what mainstream &quot;common knowledge&quot; would predict.  Common  <br/>
  knowledge encourages parents to make such absolute statements as these:<br/>
<br/>
  They would spend all day, every day, in front of the the TV, computer  <br/>
  or playstation if they were allowed to.<br/>
<br/>
  If I I left him to his own plans, he would be playing the gameboy or  <br/>
  watching TV all day long.<br/>
<br/>
  Left to himself he would play Gamecube and torment his sister.<br/>
<br/>
  My Mitchell (5) would watch it all day if I didn&#39;t say that&#39;s  <br/>
  enough...get outside and play, now.<br/>
<br/>
  I know if I let my son do ONLY what he wanted to do that is what he  <br/>
  would choose. [of video games]<br/>
<br/>
  If I let him do exactly what he wants he will just watch tv constantly.<br/>
<br/>
  (More here:  http://sandradoddcom/ifilet )<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Holly, who&#39;s fourteen and longs for carrots, can watch TV or play  <br/>
  games all day if she wants to.  She can watch R rated movies all she  <br/>
  wants to.  She can rent them at the video place that&#39;s just a few  <br/>
  hundred yards out our back gate.  I set their rental privileges to  <br/>
  &quot;unlimited&quot; years ago.   Yesterday she watched The Lion King while  <br/>
  she did cut-paper art, and then went and played Guitar Hero until her  <br/>
  hand hurt, then talked to her brother a while and got in the hot tub  <br/>
  with her dad.   You might be inclined not to believe me, but those  <br/>
  who have met Holly or Kirby or Marty are glad to believe it.<br/>

I should point out that there&#39;s no way to prove by my kids that  <br/>
&quot;unschooling works.&quot;  Maybe they&#39;re just genetically like me and  <br/>
Keith, who met in a madrigal group we didn&#39;t have to be in, as part  <br/>
of a medieval studies club we didn&#39;t have to be in, where he had made  <br/>
clothes for ourselves just for fun, and so forth.<br/>
<br/>
Though it doesn&#39;t prove that they are energetic and curious and  <br/>
trustworthy *because* they were unschooled, what I think it does  <br/>
prove is that those who say that childhood bedtimes can&#39;t ever get   <br/>
jobs when they&#39;re grown, and that kids who aren&#39;t taught to read will  <br/>
grow up illiterate, and if kids are allowed to watch as much TV as  <br/>
they want their brains will turn to mush and they&#39;ll never turn the  <br/>
TV off (oh... I haven&#39;t ever even thought of it, but none of our kids  <br/>
need glasses.  Neither did I until I was 40, nor Keith until he was  <br/>
45 or so, so again—probably entirely genetic).<br/>
