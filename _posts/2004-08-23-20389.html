Very cute. Yes. *Something* is wrong. But nothing is REALLY wrong, <br/>
meaning VERY wrong. See my original, carefully chosen wording please.<br/>
**********I wasn&#39;t trying to be cute.<br/>
I will attempt to be clearer, nothing is really wrong TO YOU. To the child, <br/>
the end of a movie IS *really* wrong. Saying goodbye to something, whether it <br/>
is Grandma going home after a stay, a gently caught toad int eh yard that has <br/>
to be release, or Elmo &quot;leaving the room&quot;, can be extremely difficult and <br/>
emotionally wrenching.<br/>
To the one experiencing the emotion, it is REAL.************<br/>

She is not in physical pain from an injury. She is not starving. She is <br/>
not scared. She is not lonely or neglected. <br/>
******* she may well be lonely for Elmo*********<br/>
I am there for her if she <br/>
wants a hug.<br/>
**********Maybe she is crying because she really wants a hug, from <br/>
Elmo************** <br/>

Part of the reason why DH found her outburst amusing and cute, rather <br/>
than disturbing, is because he knew nothing MAJOR was wrong. If she fell <br/>
and smashed her head open on the concrete steps in front of our house, <br/>
his response to her crying (and her cry itself) would have been much <br/>
different.<br/>

I myself have had to hide quite a few grins from my kids, but as my <br/>
understanding of them grows, so does my empathy towrd their feelings. I believe that in <br/>
their minds, at the beginning of their emotion, when they first realized <br/>
whatever it may be that is upsetting them, this issue *is* major. It hurts. They <br/>
are crying. To me, that isn&#39;t really amusing anymore.<br/>
Clear as mud, huh? :o)<br/>
