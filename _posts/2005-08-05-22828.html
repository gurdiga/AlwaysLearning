<div id="ygrps-yiv-1582477224">&quot;Pundit curses, walks off of show&quot; was an AOL headline this morning.   One of <br/>
the CNN commentators got cranky at someone and said &quot;that&#39;s bullshit.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;That&#39;s bullshit&quot; is not a curse.<br/>
I wish people who dealt in language, who were reporting that other people had <br/>
taken real action based on language (the commentator was suspended) would <br/>
CARE about language.<br/>
<br/>
A curse is when you speak a wish of harm or condemnation on a person.   &quot;Go <br/>
to hell&quot; is a curse.   &quot;F*** you&quot; is probably a curse (if we followed it back <br/>
to when it might&#39;ve been a complete sentence, or if it&#39;s a modernized version <br/>
of &quot;damn you,&quot; which is for sure a curse and is &quot;May God damn you to hell for <br/>
this,&quot; shortened down.<br/>
<br/>
I wish everyone who&#39;s concerned with &quot;bad words&quot; would have to pass a test on <br/>
what &quot;curse&quot; means and which words are old and what phrases stand for but <br/>
language isn&#39;t like that.   It&#39;s free to be misused by just anyone without a <br/>
license or certification. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

And misuse leads to new and varying definitions of common  words.  And that&#39;s <br/>
how the word &quot;curse&quot; came to also describe some  words as taboo or <br/>
inappropriate, even though they don&#39;t carry the intent of  damning someone to hell.<br/>

I saw that this morning too. Went to read it to see what the &quot;curse <br/>
word&quot; was and cracked up!<br/>
<br/>
I was banned from posting AND READING a local homeschool association <br/>
list (I&#39;m still a member, but can&#39;t read the e-list! &lt;bwg&gt;) because I <br/>
called &quot;bullshit&quot; on something someone posted (I think it was about <br/>
H$LDA) .<br/>
<br/>
Many (I guess) members wrote to complain of my cussing on-list. &lt;G&gt;<br/>

I think I can live without that list! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Technically, it&#39;s not &quot;swearing&quot; or an &quot;oath&quot; either.<br/>
<br/>
People swore an oath to promise that they were going to do something.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;By the blood of the cross, I will ride my steed to the Holy Land and<br/>
retrieve the Holy Grail.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Little stuff like that.<br/>
<br/>
And that turned into the British &quot;swear&quot; word, &quot;bloody.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was fascinated when I put that all together while reading a bunch of<br/>
English literature -- y&#39;know, for a degree. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So what is it, technically and historically, the words we use now,<br/>
like bullshit and just plain sh**?<br/>

I looked it up on the little dictionary my computer has (which sometimes is <br/>

swear words.   DOH!    But literally it just means a word stuck in, like when you <br/>

I guess they are vulgar exclamations.   <br/>

(ahem) it&#39;s still a noun, and it&#39;s still part of an implied sentence which I <br/>
suppose would be either &quot;That is bullshit&quot; or &quot;You are full of bullshit.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And If someone just says &quot;Oh hell&quot; it&#39;s a noun short for &quot;Oh, damn it to <br/>
hell.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But when the bad guy in a melodrama says &quot;Curses; foiled again,&quot; that&#39;s not <br/>
really a curse.   It&#39;s like *&#(@*#$!!!<br/>

 <br/>
An epithet’s a word or phrase that people can use<br/>
When  ordinary words and phrases simply won’t do<br/>
To express frustration, pain,  impatience, anger, or scorn<br/>
To the [bleep]s and the [bleep]s in your  way<br/>
 <br/>
The mayor loved the women and he loved cocaine<br/>
He got  himself a hooker to keep him entertained<br/>
But after he discovered she was  workin’ undercover<br/>
Then his honor started utterin’ epithets!<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;[bleep] damn [bleep] ship me up! [bleep] bull[bleep]! This is  <br/>
m[bleep]gi[bleep]sma [bleep] [bleep]! [bleep] [bleep]hi[bleep]ter!&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Epithets ([bleep])<br/>
Show emotion ([bleep]), impatience  ([bleep]),<br/>
Frustration ([bleep]), and in anger  ([bleep])<br/>
Amen!<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Aw, [bleep]! It’s over.&quot;<br/>

When I  heard the blurb on NPR I assumed that Novak had told Carville to <br/>
&quot;F***  off&quot; or something to that effect for there to be such a big  stink<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

I think it was more like he walked off the set than he said a  bad word.  I <br/>
mean, Jon Stewart called whatshisname a dick.  It  made the news but he didn&#39;t <br/>
storm off like Novak did.  <br/>

It&#39;s about time someone stormed off one of those screamfest  shows.<br/>

The article seemed to suggest that he had found an easy &quot;out&quot; to the <br/>
upcoming question about his part in the CIA/Plame leak.<br/>
<br/>
What was being discussed was trivial in comparison to what often takes <br/>
place. He may have been just looking for an escape, saw an exit, and <br/>
scooted. He might have thought it would save face in the long run.<br/>

I watched the video a couple of times, and James Carville was  cracking jokes <br/>
after the question was asked and saying all kinds of bs that was  hard to <br/>
understand.  I think *that&#39;s* what pissed him  off.   I understand that, because <br/>
Carville is really annoying  sometimes, and he doesn&#39;t stop talking and his <br/>
voice is funky.  I don&#39;t  think it was the question, exactly, but I didn&#39;t read <br/>
Novak&#39;s statement  afterwards.   <br/>
 <br/>
But that&#39;s off-topic so I&#39;ll let it go.<br/>
