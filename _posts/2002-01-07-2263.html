<h4>The Mowery Family</h4>
<time> 7 Jan 2002, at  9:23am</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2011263446">1.)  All are welcome to come to Michigan to visit our family.  We have a teeny house, but bring sleeping bags - we might get lucky enough to borrow the kinfolk cottage on Lake Huron if you come in warmer weather.  We love to have company, but allergy folks be prepared;  we have 3 cats, 2 dogs (all rescuees). <br/>
<br/>
2.)  I love all the family photos, I really do.  It is so nice to finally have faces to put with the names.<br/>
<br/>
3.)  I am 33, had grey hair since 13 - and if my normal hair color was anything but bleck brown I would leave nature to take its course.  However, I do enjoy changing the color of my hair every now and then.  As my husbands grandmother says, &quot;ya have to paint an old barn once in a while&quot;.<br/>
