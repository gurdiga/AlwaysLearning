<div id="ygrps-yiv-1042600530">from an article that tests something John Holt found. They don&#39;t say they are <br/>
doing that, but I remember himdoing similar things and recording them in How <br/>
Children Fail or How Children Learn. Anyhow, the article is How Babies Think <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=how-babies-think">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=how-babies-think</a> for the intro <br/>
and an option to buy the rest) and it&#39;s in the July 2010 issue of Scientific <br/>
American and I&#39;m just going to type out the bit that I thought was so cool: <br/>
<br/>
--------<br/>
In other recent research my group found that young children who think they are <br/>
being instructed modify their statistical analyses and may become less creative <br/>
as a result. The experimenter showed four-year-olds a toy that would play music <br/>
if you performed the right sequence of actions on it, such as pulling a handle <br/>
and then squeezing a bulb. For some children, the experimenter said, &quot;I don&#39;t <br/>
know how this toy works--let&#39;s figure it out.&quot; She proceeded to try out various <br/>
longer action sequences for the children, some that ended with the short <br/>
sequence and made music and some that did not. When she asked the children to <br/>
make the toy work, many of them tried the correct short sequence, astutely <br/>
omitting actions that were probably superfluous based on the statistics of what <br/>
they had seen. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
With other children, the experimenter said that she would teach them how the toy <br/>
worked by showing them sequences that did and did not produce music, and then <br/>
she acted on the toy in exactly the same way. When asked to make the toy work, <br/>
these children never tried a shortcut. Instead they mimicked the entire sequence <br/>
of actions. Were these children ignoring the statistics of what they say? <br/>
Perhaps not--their behavior is accurately described by a Bayesian model in which <br/>
the &quot;teacher&quot; is expected to choose the most instructive sequences. In simple <br/>
terms: if she knew shorter sequences worked, she would not have them the <br/>
unnecessary actions. <br/>
<br/>
-----------<br/>
<br/>
So, what they&#39;ve found is that taking on the role of <br/>
she-who-holds-all-the-knowledge shuts down any tendency someone else has to <br/>
explore other means of using the item. I know I&#39;ve done that. <br/>
