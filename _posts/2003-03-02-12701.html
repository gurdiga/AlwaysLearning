I liked your article in HEM&#39;s new issue!   Very cool.<br/>
<br/>
Since you&#39;re always reminiscing about Alaska I thought I mention the<br/>
start of the Iditarod today in down town Anchorage.   Because of lack of<br/>
snow the restart was moved to Fairbanks.   Can you believe that?   On the<br/>
Chena river behind Pike&#39;s Waterfront Lodge.<br/>
<br/>
Sigh.<br/>
<br/>
Read more about the trucked in snow and other silliness at www.adn.com<br/>
and www.iditarod.com.<br/>

<br/>
Yes!   Ditto!   <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Looking at the table of contents,  it was great to see that so many of the main articles were unschooling ones.    Cool!<br/>
<br/>
Also, seeing so many familiar names!   I&#39;m amidst celebrities!  Heehee!      <br/>
