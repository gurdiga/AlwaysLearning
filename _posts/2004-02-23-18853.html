<div id="ygrps-yiv-802572275">We just got our new little ratties from Amy. They are delightful. We went <br/>
down to get two girls and came back with FOUR!<br/>
<br/>
Duncan named the first one &quot;Lola&quot; (she&#39;s a dilute black berkshire).<br/>
I named the beige hooded girl, &quot;Julia&quot;.<br/>
Cameron wanted &quot;G-L-O-R-I-A&quot; for the dilute agouti berkshire.<br/>
<br/>
By now we&#39;d realized that these were all Rock&#39;n&#39;Roll girls&#39; names, so Ben <br/>
chimed in with &quot;Roxanne&quot; for the last little girl, a dilute agouti berkshire.<br/>
<br/>
We sing to them all the time! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Nice to be among the land of the ratties again! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
