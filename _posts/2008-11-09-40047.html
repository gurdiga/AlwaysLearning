I had just answered that question this afternoon on this list, and  <br/>
yet the same day, I was accused of not answering questions! :-)<br/>

My former answer:<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t think of it as &quot;compromise&quot; here, but as consideration and<br/>
generosity. When the priorities are known (at our house, happiness<br/>
and learning) then when there&#39;s a conflict, the thing that leads more<br/>
toward learning or fulfilling obligations (kids being at work on<br/>
time, getting purchases to the post office) or things that lead to<br/>
more peace will get the first car keys and money. Other things can<br/>
wait.<br/>
<br/>
When the kids were babies, we tried to make them comfortable. In no<br/>
time at all, we started seeing them trying to make other people<br/>
comfortable, too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My further answer:<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I do lots of things for each other.  We did before we  <br/>
had children.  It wasn&#39;t always &quot;compromise&quot;--there were more  <br/>
creative solutions many times.  For example, if we were at a party  <br/>
and he was ready to go home and I wasn&#39;t (I&#39;m an extrovert and he&#39;s  <br/>
not), sometimes he would get a ride home, or he would take the car  <br/>
and I would get a ride  home later.  That&#39;s a win/win, not a  <br/>
compromise.  Sometimes if other rides weren&#39;t going to work, he would  <br/>
stay a little later than he wanted to, and I would leave earlier than  <br/>
I would have liked.  That&#39;s a compromise.<br/>
<br/>
We have not &quot;taught&quot; our children to &quot;truly compromise.&quot;  Yet my  <br/>
children are very considerate of other people in situations in which  <br/>
different desires are expressed (Holly not so much when it involves  <br/>
which restaurant to go to, but she&#39;s gotten better over the years).   <br/>
They have lots of experience in finding solutions to disagreements  <br/>
and disparate wishes.  Because we&#39;ve been nice to them, they&#39;re full  <br/>
of niceness for others.<br/>
<br/>
Had our goal been to teach them to truly compromise, they wouldn&#39;t be  <br/>
nearly as cool and easy to get along with as they are.<br/>
