<div id="ygrps-yiv-264232621">hello all,<br/>
I just wanted to touch in and let all of those who gave me so many things to<br/>
thinkabout and do re *my* testing anxiety, (in italy, unschooling all by my<br/>
lonesome) that we survived and shanti took the exam on Monday this week...<br/>
<br/>
I never got back to yo all as you may well imagine with 7 children, two<br/>
family businesses, and a minifarm with animals  plus me trying to create<br/>
online community for homeschooling and attachment parenting in italy is<br/>
keeping me rather busy, lol.<br/>
<br/>
I really took to heart the suggestion that Lisa Wendell threw out to me:<br/>
<br/>
&#92;&#92;Would she understand if you had a conversation with her about how she has<br/>
to<br/>
take this test just to keep them happy so she can continue to stay at home?<br/>
Just make it a &quot;it&#39;s really not a big deal, you will do as well as you can<br/>
and<br/>
get it over with, kind of conversation.&quot; That you&#39;ll do something special<br/>
afterwards to celebrate that it is over and she gets to stay home. Tell her<br/>
you&#39;d rather she not have to take the test (so she knows you are on her<br/>
side)<br/>
but it is unavoidable so we will do it and not make anything of it. Let her<br/>
know you and dad think she is wonderful exactly where she is and you know<br/>
she is<br/>
doing well in life - living and learning through living her interests but to<br/>
continue on this path they have this test - maybe not even call it a test -<br/>
just<br/>
call it something different - perhaps call it &quot;they want to go over some<br/>
things<br/>
with you and ask you some questions.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Could you approach it from a playful aspect: It&#39;s just a silly little rule<br/>
they<br/>
have about children that don&#39;t go to school. Skip around / dance around<br/>
before<br/>
or afterwards. Do something special together - go get an ice-cream cone (or<br/>
what ever would be special to her). Put on her favorite music and have a<br/>
party<br/>
/ celebration afterwards? Put the focus on FUN ? Spend a lot of time<br/>
planning<br/>
together this special event so that she focuses on the FUN.&#92;&#92;&#92;<br/>
<br/>
sorry to copy it all out, but for me this was just sooo key.  *this* is<br/>
*me*...but my fears were taking over the show...<br/>
<br/>
we made an exam dress together, she doing the design, measurements and<br/>
(modelling lol)<br/>
we made plans for where to go afterwards (to the local, famous pastry shop<br/>
near the school) and we had an end of school/finished exam party for lunch<br/>
(as all her olders had their first day of vacation on her exam day), and we<br/>
just relaxed. a few days later she wanted to know what might be on the test,<br/>
and we went thru her books and I showed her what I thought they might be<br/>
interested in seeing... I left it up to her to cover anything in particular,<br/>
but I upped my playing on the computer at mathy sites and found out we have<br/>
alot of fun together doing that!  that was it for review.  that met my needs<br/>
for consistancy &quot;unschooling-wise&quot;.  the last three days she set to work, on<br/>
her own accord, to finish up a times table grid that is in one of her<br/>
books...I was totally relaxed about whether she reviewed or not, that felt<br/>
real good.  I had really let go of the whole thing.<br/>
<br/>
The day of the exam, shanti had woke up scared to go, but bit by bit we got<br/>
up, ate, got in the car, got out, got into the school, met the teachers that<br/>
did the exam, waited for them to get ready, got in the room...slowly slowly<br/>
her fear calmed and she became herself again.  They had prepared three<br/>
test sections,<br/>
<br/>
science/geography: a couple worksheets with the cycle of life of the<br/>
seed/plant, and the egg/chick/chicken.  another with the circle of the days<br/>
of the week, the months the seasons...  some pics with before during and<br/>
after to figure out...<br/>
<br/>
math: a bunch of stuff she was familiar with...the only trouble there were<br/>
knowing the multiplications by memory: the teacher was real n ice and she<br/>
saw she understood the principals involved with multiplication so after<br/>
calculating a few like 8x9, 7x8, on her fingers<br/>
the teacher just waved the rest, lol.<br/>
<br/>
and for language some reading and answering the questions.<br/>
<br/>
she was real fun to watch (we, me and her two smaller brothers were right<br/>
there with her, and she got to sit in my lap as long as she wished):  she<br/>
would look a page, say &quot;this is too easy&quot; and toss it aside!! totally normal<br/>
lol.  the teachers would say, but no, please, fill it out, just for us? we<br/>
really need to have that silly piece of paper so you can just keep on doing<br/>
school at home...and she: &quot;okay, but its silly stuff...&quot;  LOL!<br/>
<br/>
towards the end (it took about 2 hours!, I think they didnt realize how much<br/>
stuff they had gathered for her to do) she was getting tired and the teacher<br/>
(that later I found out is the vice principal!) was just so nice and really<br/>
walked her thru each thing...<br/>
<br/>
Shana was just soo happy to have faced it and got it done.  I had made sure<br/>
in advance no mention of grades or passing failing what not would be<br/>
mentioned in front of her, and they really respected that.<br/>
<br/>
as for me?  I really figured out alot of stuff.  Like why I was so anxious.<br/>
I hate ambiguous situations.  And here I really couldnt figure out  what was<br/>
going on.  I wont go into all the details, but alot that came up for me was<br/>
linked with my feeling so sad that the relationship that I had had with one<br/>
particular teacher of my first 4 children, just went down the drain because<br/>
of our choosing to homeschool.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I found out that because of that &quot;friendship&quot; that turned out not to<br/>
be such a friendship, I was lacking in clarity about what I *really*<br/>
wanted:  dh said it so well:  &quot;you got what you wanted, didnt you?&quot;  and<br/>
me:  &quot;what did I want?&quot;  and him: &quot;you wanted to let your girl learn in<br/>
freedom, no?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
this just about floored me because I was getting sucked back into a school<br/>
mentality all because of my fears around this testing.  So I started reading<br/>
the archives here and elsewhere... and I came across this post, that sandra<br/>
wrote recently but seems I missed:<br/>

<br/>
reading this was so grounding for some reason (just to read that someone<br/>
else had to deal with testing and what they did was wnderful)...and I came<br/>
away filled with a new ...vehemence? cant find the word.  I want to find out<br/>
more as to why testing is so detrimental to natural learning (unschooled<br/>
learning???) , and to any kind of learning...<br/>
<br/>
Arent there any articles or research on this subject?<br/>
<br/>
Im am also very committed now to forming a homeschooling unschooling forum<br/>
to help  italian homeschoolers connect...we have one already but it is run<br/>
by a religious group that is very helpful, but they moniter ruthlessly.  It<br/>
makes for communicating freely a bit difficult...to say the least.  (nothing<br/>
against the religion, I can understand their needs to protect their<br/>
community from subversive thinking, lol like challanging the officials on<br/>
testing, which is something I and others are trying to explore (with lots of<br/>
posts not going thru, unfortunately)...<br/>
<br/>
Im trying to figure out how to describe (radical) unschooling to people who<br/>
have never heard of it.  A lot of italians cannot read english worth a dime.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am reluctant to use the tearm &quot;unschooling&quot; so I was wondering what others<br/>
might think a good term would be to use (translated into italian of<br/>
course!)...<br/>
<br/>
maybe that shoould be another thread? Ive been here too long already, but I<br/>
really wanted to let you all know that we survived and are stronger for it..<br/>
more determined that ever!<br/>
<br/>

ps Sandra, I was wondering how the &quot;curriculum&quot; translation worked out for<br/>
you all? maybe you would prefer to have the  eng. originals in italian first<br/>
before using my version? also, recently rereading it, there are a few things<br/>
Id like to change, as I noticed  that I have a few &quot;teaching&quot; POV rather<br/>
than learning POV that I missed.<br/>
<br/>
Also, because I need to really help a few friends in particular, that I may<br/>
post about for advice soon, what should I translate first???<br/>
okay thats probably way too much for one thread update, lol!<br/>
