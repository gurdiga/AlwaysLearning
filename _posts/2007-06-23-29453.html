<div id="ygrps-yiv-1621377120">I&#39;ve been working on this since I saw the initial post, so this isn&#39;t in<br/>
reaction to anything posted today!<br/>
<br/>
When I had three kids who were (in my case) 6, 4 and 10 weeks, I was feeling<br/>
very overwhelmed with adjusting to life with three children, partially<br/>
because my third newborn was quite a bit harder to calm than my older two<br/>
*and* she had some anatomical issues that made breastfeeding more<br/>
challenging for her.<br/>
<br/>
Around that time, I also had the misconception that 11-year-olds would act<br/>
more like little adults. I know lots of eleven-year-olds now who are<br/>
wonderful and great fun, but I had unfair expectations of how friends&#39;<br/>
11-year-olds would be acting when I had only younger children -- I didn&#39;t<br/>
expect all the activity and noise! It&#39;s similar to how I had a misconception<br/>
that it was easier to have older children than babies and toddlers. It&#39;s<br/>
easier in a certain sense because their physical maintenance needs are<br/>
lessened, but older children have emotional and intellectual needs that take<br/>
more than a breast and a cuddle to fulfill.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not accusing anyone of having unfair expectations, but I&#39;m sharing what<br/>
I remember of my life at that times. It sounds as though it might be a<br/>
possibility that the original poster can explore herself.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#39;ve found that it helps to treat other people&#39;s kids who are guests<br/>
in my home as though they are my own. Which, for me, has translated into<br/>
giving them the benefit of the doubt about things and talking to them<br/>
kindly. I&#39;ve found when I make an effort to establish rapport with the<br/>
children in my kids&#39; lives that our time together is a lot easier. If I sit<br/>
and play with them, they&#39;re much more open to my suggestion of &quot;Let&#39;s pick<br/>
this up now!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I also think that sometimes with a young baby that a lot of issues that have<br/>
been simmering without much attention on mom&#39;s part suddenly seem really<br/>
urgent because of the increased stress her life. The problem is is that the<br/>
mother is now in a situation where she has these really intense needs and<br/>
isn&#39;t the best at problem-solving herself, particularly if she has a picture<br/>
in her mind of what she *needs* to feel good again and isn&#39;t thinking about<br/>
other ways that she might feel even better.<br/>
<br/>
I can tell you how I got through it. I got out of the house as much as I<br/>
could so we weren&#39;t a) messing up the house or b) having me look at the mess<br/>
that was there. I went over to a friend&#39;s house a lot, where they had<br/>
playmates. I played with the kids and read to them a lot, just like normal,<br/>
at the library or at parks. I sat outside with them and watched them while<br/>
they played with their friends and I held the baby.<br/>
<br/>
I think, though, too, that a lot of the things that make family life happier<br/>
when you add another child are things that are best done *before* the new<br/>
one comes. Having a strong foundation of listening to the kids makes it a<br/>
lot easier when stressful times hit. Which doesn&#39;t help the original poster.<br/>
:-) <br/>
<br/>
One thing I also do when adding additional children is talk honestly and<br/>
nonjudgmentally about the adjustment on the family, talk about how it takes<br/>
some time for me to recover from having a baby and how I know it&#39;s difficult<br/>
for them, too. I&#39;ve found that my kids, who get their needs met, do<br/>
understand pretty well when I have to say, &quot;Right now, I&#39;m sorry; I can&#39;t do<br/>
(fill-in-the-blank)&quot; My fill-in-the-blank is a specific and temporary<br/>
limitation and not, significantly, something like &quot;Your friends can&#39;t come<br/>
over anymore.&quot; It&#39;s not something that I say to them arbitrarily or<br/>
frequently. We plan when we can do the desired thing again, so they know<br/>
that the baby doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;ll *never* do certain things again! I remember<br/>
being overwhelmed with my first child at all his needs in early infancy --<br/>
and I was a relatively well-read adult. Kids can feel that overwhelming<br/>
feeling just as strongly.<br/>
<br/>
Talking honestly about the whole family&#39;s adjustment meant that I&#39;d hear<br/>
things like, &quot;I wish you didn&#39;t have another baby&quot; from a 6yo while a 4yo<br/>
nodded vehemently. I found that accepting those kinds of statements (I have<br/>
heard mothers discount or react with anger to negative feelings like this)<br/>
seem to lessen the tension in the family for everyone. Also, lots of talk<br/>
about what their babyhoods were like is always delightful for them.<br/>
<br/>
I do find it interesting that many people do come to the list with questions<br/>
and many personal non-negotiables right when they&#39;ve added a baby! I think<br/>
the non-negotiables are a way of feeling back in control; I think it&#39;s<br/>
important, though, to avoid damaging relationships. Letting go a bit  seems<br/>
to help considerably more with feeling normal again than trying to hang on<br/>
to an attachment to what would have been normal before the kids came.<br/>
