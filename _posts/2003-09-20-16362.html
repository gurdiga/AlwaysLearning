<div id="ygrps-yiv-1420733355">Firstly, I wanted you all to know that even though I haven&#39;t posted on here for soooo long, I have been reading your posts when I&#39;ve had time. YOu are all fantastic inspiration for the sticky moments when things are hard work. I don&#39;t know many people locally who are as &#39;bookish but unschooling&#39; as us, so it&#39;s a real tonic to read how you are all getting on day to day. THANK YOU!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the main reason for my post is that I wanted to pick your brains about my eldest. He&#39;s 10yo & has been out of school for coming up to a year & a half now. On the whole things are going swimmingly. <br/>
<br/>
The only fly in the ointment seems to be he&#39;s hesitant to do anything that takes a large dose of determination. He&#39;s happy to try anything, but if it doesn&#39;t come easily to him he gets frustrated & gives up. I&#39;m not looking for suggestions for how to make him do anything; because that&#39;s his choice, but I&#39;d like ideas for how to help him not get so frustrated so that he&#39;ll feel able to carry on trying until he gets where he wants to be. Having been in school seems to have given him a reluctance to &#39;fail&#39; which hasn&#39;t worn off yet. We&#39;ve talked about the idea that he&#39;s not failing, just hasn&#39;t succeeded yet. Part of the problem is that he sets himself really high goals, but doesn&#39;t seem to want to go through the learning curve to get there. Well I think I&#39;ve waffled on for quite long enough now! Tell me your thoughts please.<br/>

Why can&#39;t he just do 2000 fun little things? They&#39;ll all eventually tie in <br/>
together as parts of his model of the universe.<br/>

Instead of helping you help him not to be frustrated, I&#39;d rather help you not <br/>
press him to go past his point of frustration.<br/>
<br/>
Trying something until it&#39;s not fun anymore is quite a success, if you stop <br/>
before the frustration comes.  Pushing into frustration can turn the whole <br/>
thing from fun to failure.<br/>

A year and a half isn&#39;t very long, and ten isn&#39;t very old.<br/>
<br/>
He sets himself high goals like what?<br/>
<br/>
If he has the goals without deadlines, he just hasn&#39;t gotten there Yet, and <br/>
that&#39;s fine.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say discourage him from setting goals he can&#39;t reach for now, and just <br/>
play and have fun and do smaller things with you, and with other people!<br/>

Lynda:&gt;&gt;&gt;He&#39;s the one who&#39;s pushing himself! I&#39;d be happy for him to stop before he gets to that point & then come back (or not) some other time.<br/>

Me:&gt;&gt;&gt; I know that for a fact! lol. He&#39;s only just starting to rediscover maths as someting that can be fun. He&#39;s left tables & division well alone, but enjoys drawing Koch snowflakes & the other day worked out how old he was in seconds in his head. He&#39;s starting to find out what bits of mathematics are useful/interesting to him & in those areas he seems more able to recognise when he&#39;s getting close to his frustration point & will put the ideas to one side for a while until something prompts him to come back to them.<br/>

Me: It not so much the goals themselves that are the problem, but his desire to get there right away, e.g. he wants to make LOTR figures but gets frustrated that he can&#39;t make them as detailed & intricate as a professionally produced piece. Yesterday we were looking at Japanese art & he decided to produce his own version of the great wave & Mt. Fuji. That ended in slamming down of pencils & getting really frustrated that he couldn&#39;t get the wave to look just the way he wanted it to look.  He seems to see what other people, experts in their field, have produced and wants to be able to emulate them; but he doesn&#39;t seem to grasp that they probably didn&#39;t get it *right* first time. He&#39;s always thought big, IYSWIM, & I think I need a way to help him break his ideas into more managable chunks.<br/>
<br/>
Now I have to go & serve icecream for lunch. ;-)<br/>

This sounds so much like my dd, who is 4.5.  Your idea of breaking things<br/>
into manageable chunks is a great one.  I haven&#39;t been tuned into her<br/>
frustration in this way yet, but I bet it will help.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that has helped with respect to her frustrations over art is for<br/>
us to explore abstract art together.  Somehow she can be more forgiving of<br/>
her own representation of a hat, for example, if she has seen that<br/>
&quot;professional&quot; artists purposefully make things not look right.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I happen to have an idea about the wave... I don&#39;t remember the title<br/>
of the book, but recently someone wrote a book about how the classic<br/>
artists used mirrors to exactly represent their drawings.  This is also<br/>
something that I&#39;ve done in art classes.  To some it may seem like<br/>
cheating, but if you read how the classic artists used the techniques, then<br/>
you are just following in some very great footsteps.  Anyway, the use of<br/>
mirrors would allow your son to sort of trace the wave, or other artwork.<br/>

Also some of the best art has come about because the artist made a mistake<br/>
and the fixing up of the mistake showed previously unseen possibilities to<br/>
the artist.  I&#39;m not sure how you&#39;d go about finding examples of that to<br/>
show him.<br/>
