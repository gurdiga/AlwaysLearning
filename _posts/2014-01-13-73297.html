<div id="ygrps-yiv-1976520597">Holly is job hunting.  She looked at this list, but I don&#39;t know whether it helped or not.  <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/jobs">http://sandradodd.com/jobs</a><br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve added Robyn Coburn&#39;s list, and another few things I came across, and two things from a concurrent discussion on volunteering.<br/>
<br/>
If people who missed the first discussion would like to look there and send other jobs, I&#39;ll add them.<br/>
<br/>
Stories of unschoolers&#39; volunteering to help out that turned to a job are welcome, too.  Short stories, for this page, would be better.<br/>
<br/>
I think maybe there was a list of hospital jobs, or someone mentioned making one, but I didn&#39;t find that.  If anyone knows where it is, I could add that, too.  <br/>
<br/>
And I had hoped for links to &quot;professional&quot; lists of jobs online somewhere, but if they came I might have been too busy or distracted to get the on that page. Help!  <br/>
<br/>
Holly spent one day helping a sound engineer who&#39;s starting a home studio, and is going back.  It&#39;s a trial situation to see if he wants to apprentice her.  He&#39;s working for free, at first, to create a body of work, and to practice with his new equipment.  He&#39;s a certified recording engineer, but hasn&#39;t worked independently before.  That&#39;s not &quot;a job,&quot; for Holly, but it&#39;s certainly a learning opportunity!<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s out today with resumes going to hotels.  <br/>
<br/>
When i was in the UK last summer talking about jobs my kids had as teens, I was told it&#39;s not legal there, for teens to work.   I think it must be possible for a home educated teen to do volunteer work, or to help out at a business somewhere.  If there are Brit parents here who know, please feel free to jump in here with stories or links.  Even if they can&#39;t be paid before 18, if that&#39;s the law (is it?) they could get experience, somehow, it seems.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-522567527">I was a picture framer for ten years before we moved to the US.  I loved that job.  I got to frame so many objects, including a snowboard, a wedding dress and a gun from the US civil war - first time I had ever held any of those items in my hands.  I got to handle and look up close on many wonderful works of art, and hear so many stories about why different things were meaningful to different people.  Children&#39;s art was some of my favourite to frame.  <br/>
<br/>
Before that I worked in a small art gallery.  Before that I worked in a photo lab (I see that one listed).  Before that a grocery store.  I was a cashier, then front end manager.  Honestly, I&#39;ve enjoyed all my jobs.  <br/>
<br/>
Since Ethan was born, I&#39;ve been drawing and painting and selling works locally in cafes and small art galleries, as well as on Ebay for a few years.  Ebay was a thrill, as I got to ship pieces all over the world...literally.  I still love to think about where my different works are living.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
I have volunteered a few places, but my favourite was a local soup kitchen where Ethan and I got to hand out desert before cleaning up after lunch service.  Ethan loved handing out the food to people, and has since said he would either like to be a waiter or help people.  Or a Youtuber.  He&#39;s eleven.<br/>
<br/>
My dad went as far as grade three, at which time he left home with one of his brothers.  From that point, he learned to read and write well enough to fill out applications for various jobs.  Along the way, he learned the skills to be a welder and boiler maker.  Gradually he learned enough practical skills and math to become head mechanic at an ice cream factory where he worked for twenty years before retiring at age 55.  I got to live with many years of free ice cream!  <br/>
<br/>
My mom worked on some of the very first telegraph machines at Marconi in Montreal when she was a teen.  She went as far as grade seven in school.  In her twenties she got married and was asked to leave her position to make room for unmarried women and men.  Funny story...my mom and dad both worked at Marconi for a short time together.  My dad worked in the mail room.  He remembers my mom, but she doesn&#39;t remember him.  They met again twenty years later when he moved in with her and my brothers as a room and boarder.  My mom later sold Avon for many years, and remained dedicated to making a comfortable home for her family.<br/>
<br/>
My husband worked for his dad as a boy.  His dad was a self-taught inventor, and Doug has fantastic memories of hearing the rumble of some newly invented machine in the basement.  Later Doug&#39;s dad started a factory called James Packaging, where he made (from scratch) machines for packaging items in vacuum formed plastic.  (Doug actually wired some of those up for his dad after taking some electronics classes in high school.)  But before the factory, he did it all in the basement of their small house, and Doug and his sister helped.  Doug tells me of a time when he helped package thousands of containers of bird de-licer with his sister.  With the money they earned, they bought themselves matching desks and Doug bought Atari games.<br/>
<br/>
Doug went through university and grad school on full scholarships after that, always hugely inspired by the things he was learning.  He started out in physics, moved to applied math, and finished with his PhD thesis in computer graphics. He is currently working as a professor in computer science with a continued focus on physics and applied math.  Many of the animations, game engines and special effects in movies produced these days contain research that he, his students and his colleagues have worked on.  That&#39;s a thrill for Doug to see ideas of his and others be put to practical use - especially on things that bring people so much joy.  Doug even received a science and technology academy award last year for a project he and three others worked on.  Ethan and I got to go to that with him.  Can&#39;t say any of us ever imagined walking the red carpet.  It sure is interesting where life can take us!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1723452016">-=-I know some Home Ed teens who have tried to gain unpaid work experience, but have been turned down as there isn&#39;t any insurance in place. It seems schools organise  insurance for teens on work experience.  (I assume this is like pubic liability insurance ?)-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Work experience&quot; is like being at school, though, isn&#39;t it? If they&#39;re getting school credit for it?<br/>
<br/>
If a parent wanted to help it happen, they could ask about how to pay the extra for insuring one person.  Maybe it could be added as a rider to the company&#39;s existing liability or injury insurance.  Insurance companies WANT to sell insurance.<br/>

<br>
&quot;Work experience&quot; is like being at school, though, isn&#39;t it? If they&#39;re getting school credit for it?<br>
<br>
If a parent wanted to help it happen, they could ask about how to pay the extra for insuring one person.  Maybe it could be added as a rider to the company&#39;s existing liability or injury insurance.  Insurance companies WANT to sell insurance.<br>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1956194218">I came across a discussion from a few years ago and added part of it to the jobs page, lower right: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/jobs">http://sandradodd.com/jobs</a><br/>
<br/>
But the big part is much of this article:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.careerbuilder.com/Article/CB-1252-Who-is-Hiring-20-Jobs-You-Can-Get-With-a-High-School-Diploma/">http://www.careerbuilder.com/Article/CB-1252-Who-is-Hiring-20-Jobs-You-Can-Get-With-a-High-School-Diploma/</a><br/>
<br/>
By &quot;with a high school diploma,&quot; read &quot;without a university degree.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a little old.  There&#39;s a prediction about 2010.:-)   But it&#39;s very good. and encouraging, and addes to the list of ideas to present to teens who are worried.<br/>
