<div id="ygrps-yiv-1327370684">The past few days have been filled with sweet things Zachariah (13) has done.   <br/>
<br/>
First the umbrella incident, now this:<br/>
<br/>
Today we went to a Civil War reenactment.  During the event we were in the bleachers waiting for the main battle to start.  They came around selling drinks.  We asked for 3 Cokes but they only had two, so I said I&#39;d take a bottle of water. Later Zachariah got up and left.  We thought he&#39;d gone to the bathroom. He came back with another Coke and handed it to me.  He had wanted to get a new pocket knife he&#39;d seen in one of the seller&#39;s tents and had exactly enough money to purchase it - but he chose to spontaneously get me a Coke instead.<br/>
<br/>
The trust is there that we will get him what we can with joy and he returned that trust and faith by providing for me with joy.<br/>

they felt adversarially towards me, I can&#39;t imagine they would even <br/>
want to go out with me, let alone by me a coke with their own money!</div>
