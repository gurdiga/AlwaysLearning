<div id="ygrps-yiv-1038716276">It would be better if you&#39;d been there, to see who was where as this  <br/>
unfolded, but here&#39;s a moments-ago account of humor between teen  <br/>
siblings and a mom.  Me.<br/>
<br/>
I heard Marty singing in a strong falsetto, and he was singing &quot;Don&#39;t  <br/>
Stop Believing.&quot;  I was on my way upstairs anyway, so I called up  <br/>
ahead of myself, &quot;Holly, your voice is getting lower!&quot;  She said  <br/>
&quot;Yeah.&quot;  I said (getting closer to her room) &quot;And I like your falsetto.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
By then I was in the hallway and could see Marty, who had turned and  <br/>
was laughing silently because he knew I was actually telling him he  <br/>
was sounding  &quot;like a leetle girl.&quot;<br/>
But he also knew Holly wasn&#39;t getting it, and she said &quot;I wasn&#39;t  <br/>
singing, that was Marty.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I knew that.  Marty knew I knew.  Holly was busy with MySpace and not  <br/>
paying much attention to either of us, so Marty said (from the other  <br/>
room; they couldn&#39;t see each other though I could see both of them),  <br/>
&quot;Holly, it&#39;s a good thing you&#39;re cute.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Holly said, &quot;What?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I leaned into Holly&#39;s room and said mock-seriously, &quot;That was all a  <br/>
joke, from the very beginning.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She looked up at me and blinked and said, &quot;It&#39;s a good thing I&#39;m cute.&quot;</div>
