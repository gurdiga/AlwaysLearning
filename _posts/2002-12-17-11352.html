what I was going to do and he didn&#39;t like it too much. I half joking half <br/>
seriously asked him to take my name too. He refused. When Moly was born I <br/>
told him I really wanted the kids to have my name too and he refused again. <br/>
So I asked for a compromise that I give the kids the option to change their <br/>
names later if they wanted. I haven&#39;t given the kids that option yet, but <br/>
many times Moly has said that when she gets older she is going to add my name <br/>
to hers and if she gets married she will keep her own and won&#39;t take his <br/>
unless he takes hers! And she says she won&#39;t hyphenate his name because she <br/>
already has enough hyphens! &lt;g&gt; So she will be Moly-Elspeth Jaine Edds-Owens <br/>
or Edds-Owens Smith or what ever his name is. <br/>
<br/>
The other day I received a notice to appear in court so I could testify in an <br/>
animal abuse, neglect, cruelty case against my neighbor. It reads to: Nancy <br/>
Susan Edds AKA Nancy S. Edds-Owens AKA Nancy Susan Edds-Owens AKA Nancy S. <br/>
Owens! Someone must be very confused at the court house, or they have been <br/>
talking to my therapist. &lt;veg&gt; <br/>
<br/>
~Nancy~ of the many names<br/>
