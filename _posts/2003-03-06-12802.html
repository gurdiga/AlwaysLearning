    I&#39;m sure everyone will really enjoy these two talks. They are the same<br/>
ones we pick here last year for David. There is still some talk about it<br/>
occasionally. We&#39;re hope to host him again.<br/>

&quot;A goal is created three times. First as a mental picture.<br/>
Second, when written down to add clarity and dimension.<br/>
And third, when you take action towards its achievement.&quot;<br/>
