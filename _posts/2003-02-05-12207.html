This is really a list for folks who already &quot;get it&quot;---veteran unschoolers. <br/>
You&#39;re certainly welcome here, but there are a couple of other places where <br/>
you might feel a bit more comfortable with a lot of questions. The essays and <br/>
message boards at unschooling.com and the e-list, <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:unschoolingdotcom@yahoogroups.com">unschoolingdotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>.<br/>
<br/>
As for state laws, which state are you in? It can work in every state, but <br/>
you might need to be &quot;creative&quot; in some! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

At www.unschooling.com (the parent forum of this list) there is discussion of <br/>
reluctant spouses.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Also, I&#39;m not sure how to make it work with state laws and such. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are unschoolers making it work in every state.  A couple are famously <br/>
irritating (Pennsylvania, New York, Florida, and a few others have <br/>
peculiarities but also have trailblazers to follow), but most are simple.<br/>
<br/>
I think the hardest part of that change for some families is the kids <br/>
thinking the mom&#39;s losing it.  Depending how much verbal defense the mom did <br/>
of structure and pressure to perform on schedule, and depending what kinds of <br/>
dire alternatives were described to the kids to get them to &quot;do their work,&quot; <br/>
the mom might be fighting an uphill battle against a foe with her own voice,  <br/>
up the side of the mountain of arguments she built.  Some don&#39;t have it so <br/>
hard.  If they just said &quot;We&#39;re doing this because the curriculum says to,&quot; <br/>
although it was a lame answer at the time it&#39;s an easy answer to throw over <br/>
completely later!<br/>

  I joined over a week ago and have been following the conversations, trying to get a feel for the group. I thought I would come out of lurker mode, although I may not be very active either :)   I recognize some names from other unschooling lists.<br/>
  I&#39;m Stephanie, we live in highly regulated PA. This is my first year to deal with the requirements of compulsory age. My oldest son is 8, he is a budding meteorolgist and self taught geography buff. My second son is 5, he is a natural athlete, everything is  a sport to him. My dd will be 4 on Saturday, she is smart and headstrong. My baby is almost 16 months, and he is a daredevil and keeps me on my toes. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2084839022">Hello, My name is Cynthia, I live in Broken Arrow Ok. I have to sons <br/>
Derek 14 and Philip 11. We have been on a journey out of P.S. through <br/>
Home-schooling and seem to be comming to rest here at un-schooling. <br/>
My 14 year old was labeled L.D. since 2nd grade. He just recently <br/>
built his own computer (of course with dads help) (he didn&#39;t seem to <br/>
have any learning problem there!) We recently got a couple of fancy <br/>
rats as pets, and lo and behold, at 7:30 this morning he informed his <br/>
dad and I that he was going to do some research on rats for an essay <br/>
that he WANTS to write. Things are a lot more relaxed around here. <br/>
I&#39;m looking forward to reading posts from everyone.  Here&#39;s some very <br/>
interesting reading if any one is interested. At this site you can <br/>
read about the history of public education, how it all got started <br/>
and why.  Thanks for reading this long post, Cynthia <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1195165981">Hi Cynthia!<br/>
<br/>
John Taylor Gatto&#39;s stuff is interesting for northeastern U.S. history (urban <br/>
industrial) but it&#39;s not as true of Oklahoma, where you are, or New Mexico <br/>
where I am.<br/>
<br/>
My grandparents all went to schools in west Texas and SE New Mexico, none of <br/>
which fit Gatto&#39;s model.   <br/>
<br/>
Nothing&#39;s as simple as it seems, and the history of formal education is just <br/>
as vast as the rest of the world!  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;My 14 year old was labeled L.D. since 2nd grade.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How sad.  I hope you have stopped mentioning it to him or around him.  Labels <br/>
like that are so damaging.  How long has he been out of school?  He was seven <br/>
then and is 14 now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1065404087">Hello to all Homeschooler Mums, Dads, Aunts, Uncles, and Grandparents<br/>
(and, of course, kids!)<br/>
<br/>
I am new to all of this both the site and homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I have a 13 year old daughter who began high school this year and with<br/>
various events occurring since she started I have decided to start<br/>
homeschooling her.<br/>
<br/>
I did consider doing this for both her and her younger brother 2 years<br/>
ago, instead I enrolled them in a different school which was highly<br/>
beneficial to them both. My son now in year 6 (QLD grade) has been<br/>
identified as a child with many talents and as such he is in a class<br/>
that caters for this.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is another story.<br/>
<br/>
To cut a very long story short my daughter, Amy, began writing and<br/>
drawing before she could talk. As a result of this she has written many<br/>
stories and pictures to go with her stories and vice versa.  As Amy had<br/>
speech difficulties early on in life - which was corrected over a course<br/>
of 2 1/2 years of intense therapy -  her writing  and drawing<br/>
flourished.<br/>
<br/>
Now I am being told by school &#39;experts&#39; that she is living in a fanatsy<br/>
world, we need to get her a dog and she needs to see a psychologist. All<br/>
of this due to her drawings which she continues to do during her time.<br/>
<br/>
Whilst saying all this they then comment on how intelligent she is<br/>
but....<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say I had had enough.<br/>
<br/>
So now I am going through the process of getting her registered, trying<br/>
to figure out where to start and hopefully meet many like minded people<br/>
who have seen and experienced the many benefits of homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I have researched till my head hurts so that I get the registration<br/>
process correct without too much hassle. I have to wait for her birth<br/>
certificate to arrive from interstate (which could take up to 5 weeks)<br/>
then begin the new journey of homeschooling...<br/>
<br/>
Many blessings to all,<br/>
Tania</div>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Schools can do a lot of damage to kids with &quot;talents&quot;.  All kids have<br/>
talents, schools only recognize and encourage some of them.  Your<br/>
daughter would be a perfect example.  Artists of any kind, in schools,<br/>
are a bit marginalized, even if the schools recognize the talent.<br/>
<br/>
I can say, from my own experience, that school did more harm than good<br/>
for my art exploration.  I learned far more from my dad, than from any<br/>
classroom art class.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter, and even me, come to think of it, have been accused<br/>
of living in a fantasy world.  Well, why not live in my own world?  Why<br/>
not indulge myself in this regard?  It doesn&#39;t harm anyone.  The only<br/>
harm has come from trying to ignore it, my own self exploration, to do<br/>
what others see best.  No good can come from that.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter hasn&#39;t had to undo any of the damage that comes from<br/>
ignoring herself and her ideas to meet someone else&#39;s.  I&#39;ve encouraged<br/>
her fantasy world and have helped it come to life as much as I can. <br/>
Sure, she&#39;s a little different than most kids her age, 14 going on 15,<br/>
but she is who she is and nothing will change that.  So, I can harm her<br/>
and minimize who she is, or I can support her and encourage who she is. <br/>
To me, it&#39;s really that simple.<br/>
<br/>
All kids can thrive in an environment that supports them in the<br/>
individual ways in which they need it.  Schools don&#39;t do that nearly as<br/>
well as a caring parent that has the time to support their kids. <br/>
Unschooling is really trusting that your kids are whole and wonderful<br/>
just the way they are, trusting that they will do what they need to do<br/>
to get what they want in life.  As a parent, who unschools, what we do,<br/>
is guide them and help them in whatever way that we can, to ensure that<br/>
they do (get what they want and need).<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t sound all that different than parents who have their kids in<br/>
school, on the surface.  What is profoundly different is the<br/>
expectations that an unschooling parent has, which are very different<br/>
than school expectations.  The focus on the relationship between parent<br/>
and child and that trust and respect for the child as a person, really<br/>
is what sets unschooling apart.<br/>
<br/>
Looking for ways to change a child who is, in school eyes, needing a<br/>
psychologist, is just one of many ways in which schools do damage to<br/>
kids.  The premise is that there is something wrong with the child, or<br/>
in your son&#39;s case, something &quot;right&quot; with your child.  Neither of these<br/>
are a very good measure of a person, the unique individual sitting there<br/>
before you.  No matter how much schools try to cater to an individual,<br/>
they aren&#39;t designed to do that, they are designed to turn out a<br/>
product.  If the child fits the school model for turning out a good<br/>
product, like your son does, schools can claim to succeed.  But for<br/>
every child like your son, there is a child like your daughter.<br/>
<br/>
If you take those same 2 kids and take them out of that system, and help<br/>
each of them be the people they are, they can both succeed.  There are<br/>
no &quot;A&quot; students or &quot;B&quot; students or &quot;F&quot; students, there are only kids<br/>
with different minds and abilities, some of them just fit into the<br/>
school model better.  It says more about the school system than it does<br/>
about the child.</div>

<br/>
I agree with the first part of that.  Labels of any sort do more harm  <br/>
than good.<br/>
<br/>
Schools are designed to turn out a product, but they KNOW they do  <br/>
damage to some of the kids in order to identify their &quot;superior&quot;  <br/>
product.  They grade kids, in the worst sense of the word.  Some kids  <br/>
must be graded substandard in order that &quot;Grade A&quot; has &quot;value.&quot;<br/>

for others to share and enjoy.<br/>

The same applies to fashion and music and art of all kinds.  The<br/>
personal visions that are put out and shared with others inspire thought<br/>
and other ideas.  Everything is connected to everything else!<br/>

disagreeing with the next part?<br/>

I was having a hard time puting into words, what I was thinking.  I<br/>
wrote, then deleted, then wrote and deleted several more times!  Puting<br/>
thoughts into words sometimes comes easy for me, and sometimes not, I&#39;ve<br/>
been in a not so easy mode lately.  It seems to follow with more<br/>
clarity, which is a good thing!</div>

<br/>
I agree with this part:<br/>
-=-The premise is that there is something wrong with the child, or  in  <br/>
your son&#39;s case, something &quot;right&quot; with your child. Neither of<br/>
these are a very good measure of a person, the unique individual  <br/>
sitting there  before you. -=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t really a disagreement with the other part, but a reminder  <br/>
that when school &quot;turns out a product,&quot; there is scrap and extra  <br/>
material they don&#39;t consider their &quot;product.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1656307773">Hi Everyone,<br/>
I am new here.   I am happy to be here and am looking forward to sharing<br/>
and getting support on this journey.   I have a daughter who is 9 and<br/>
really fell into unschooling this year.   We have been homeschooling<br/>
since my daughter was old enough for kindergarten.   For kindergarten we<br/>
did a public charter and into the beginnning of 1st grade.   I then<br/>
pulled her out of the charter at the beginning of 1st grade and have<br/>
been doing it on my own.   This is our fourth year homeschooling and my<br/>
daughter loves it.    I had been meaning to set up a more structured<br/>
home school setting for this year and realized we were okay.    I have<br/>
been feeling a little guilty about not having a more structured day for<br/>
her, but I am over the guilt now and would like to continue on this way<br/>
and see what happens.   Thanks for reading.<br/>
<br/>
Peace and blessings,<br/>
Tracey</div>

<br/>
I&#39;m happy that you&#39;re here, but please read about the list and why we  <br/>
discourage some kinds of &quot;support.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/lists/alwayslearning">http://sandradodd.com/lists/alwayslearning</a><br/>
plus the main page of this list at yahoogroups<br/>
and<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/support">http://sandradodd.com/support</a><br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that the list isn&#39;t supportive, but it&#39;s not a support  <br/>
list.   I know it&#39;s an odd thing at first, but please do look at those  <br/>
links.<br/>
<br/>
There are ideas and encouragement for new unschoolers, too:<br/>

<br/>
If you fell into it (as you say), you probably didn&#39;t fall very  <br/>
gracefully, so it&#39;s good to practice walking around in it, to get  <br/>
confidence!<br/>
