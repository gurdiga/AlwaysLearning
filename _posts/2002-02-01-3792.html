ee have enough of the required ingredienst to make cookies, and are you<br/>
not saving those last eggs for something, and will we be home long enough<br/>
to finish the project?&quot; A thoughtful thing. And I think sometimes it&#39;s<br/>
conversational, too, and probably hearing &quot;Sure&quot; is nice even if you<br/>
already know that will be the answer, kind of like hearing &quot;I love you!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s more my button than anything. I hated asking for things as a kid,<br/>
and probably until I was in my late twenties. I hated giving someone else<br/>
that power over me, the power to say &quot;no&quot;. I was in a Program for Bad<br/>
Teens where we had to go up and ask for our &quot;points&quot; after every<br/>
&quot;activity&quot;, and I flat-out refused, so for months I had no<br/>
&quot;privileges&quot;... but I was free. <br/>
<br/>
And I know that turd mom feeling :-/ But you&#39;re not a turd mom, it was<br/>
just a TTMM (temporary turd mom moment). We all have &#39;em. ;-)<br/>
