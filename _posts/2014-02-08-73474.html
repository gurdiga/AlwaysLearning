<div id="ygrps-yiv-660466500"><html><div style="color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">I agree Sandra. I have seen a bunch of people call themselves&nbsp; warldorf-montessori-unschoolers or some other combination.<br>Some that I know personally are definitely not unschoolers at all but insist they are and are actually quite&nbsp; offended if you say anything or question their ideas.<br><br>I have read a lot about Montessori as my mom has training in Montessori , has been a&nbsp; Montessori teacher and translated Maria;s books and other materials in Brazil.<br>I have read many discussions with my mom about Montessori and there are things that I like about it.<br><br>What people do not know is that Maria Montessori implemented the method while working with mentally impaired children and then was called to open schools for children that had no one to look over them. Kids that were left alone because both parents ( if alive)
 were&nbsp; working many hours and this kids were poor an neglected.<br>She does say that parents are the best for children but she herself sent her son to be raised by other people and did not raise him at all.<br>In her schools she has facilitators that were supposed to be there to just help children and not teach not trained teachers like today.<br><br>There is no reason to implement Montessori if you want to unschooling your kids. They are naturally exploring in a rich environment with the parents as facilitators and&nbsp; not teachers.&nbsp; <br>Montessori materials were necessary as those kids has nothing and really nobody to watch over them.&nbsp; <br><br>Today there are so many resources available !&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>John Holt mentions Maria Montessori in his books, I can see why! It is interesting reading their books. Today we have wonderful books, discussions like this, books that are amazing from people that have real unschooled kids!
 Parents that did it and did it well.<br>Both Maria and John Holt never had kids ( well Maria had but she did not raise the child) . We are so lucky!<br><br><br><div><span><br></span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><font face="courier">Alex Polikowsky</font></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.polykow.blogspot.com/"></a>&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>  <div style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt;"> <div style="font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:12pt;"> <div dir="ltr"> <hr size="1">  <font size="2" face="Arial"> <b><span style="font-weight:bold;">From:</span></b> Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;<br> <b><span style="font-weight:bold;">To:</span></b> Always Learning &lt;AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com&gt; <br> <b><span style="font-weight:bold;">Sent:</span></b> Friday, February 7, 2014 7:33 PM<br> <b><span style="

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2024187704"><div dir="ltr">I have to admit that I take the easier road... When the person who declares that she is an unschooler talks about HER favorite curriculum and how the kids would sit around with computers all day if allowed to do &quot;nothing&quot;... I keep my mouth shut, because I spent a number of years trying to get people to change very maladaptive, damaging behavior (as a foster care social worker) usually to no avail and I am too tired to try to teach those who do not want to learn.... &nbsp;<div>

      <p>Because of another discussion somewhere else, I went to find some links about former Waldorf families. &nbsp;Didn&#39;t find them, so it was probably a folder on a forum that&#39;s no longer around. &nbsp;That&#39;s fine.&nbsp;</p>
<div><br></div><div>But looking for it, I found some things by google I had never seen before where people were citing me or saying I was crazy or scary or whatever... &nbsp;One blogger liked my stuff but was afraid, so some others were commenting that she should feel fine about ignoring me. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br></div><div>One of the comments said this: &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>-=-<span style="color:rgb(17,17,17);font-size:14px;">We unschool to a point. What I mean is I require Math,Reading and English to be done with a set curriculum.

<div><span style="color:rgb(17,17,17);font-size:14px;"><br></span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(17,17,17);font-size:14px;">Quite frequently someone will come along and in a side note or e-mail to me, or in an intro to a forum, write something like &quot;We are a Waldorf/Montessori/Unschooling-inspired family, and...&quot;</span></div>
<div><span style="color:rgb(17,17,17);font-size:14px;"><br></span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(17,17,17);font-size:14px;">And I think.... So you want to be cool. &nbsp;And you&#39;re afraid to let go of anything you thinkg might be the one magic thing.</span></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-422523482"><div dir="ltr">I started out not knowing anything, but knew I wanted something, and thought I <u>had</u> to have something. It&#39;s been a journey to become an unschooling family. I didn&#39;t want to do school at home, so I sought alternatives.<div>
<br></div><div>I read literature on Waldorf, lived near a Waldorf school and many people, I was an acquaintance of, sent their children to the school. Their children were sheltered, sweet, something I thought I wanted. I, personally, love the fantasy, love the colors, the art and found it to be beautiful. But it was too rigid, too planned, and too restrictive, all of which didn&#39;t fit our family. I next sought out Montessori, to see how that method would fit us. I made loads and loads of materials, and provided a bountiful atmosphere. I began watching youtube videos, and it turns out there is a correct way of using the materials and they are meant to be used in such a manner and not meant to be used for others. I felt this was limiting bright, creative minds. To me, the methods are in so much opposition, that there isn&#39;t a way to be both; they counter one another. The foundation of Waldorf is that a child exists in fantasy until age 6/7, the other believes that a child is solely in an &quot;absorbant mind&quot; meaning they take it in and there is a lack of creativity until age 6/7. To a young mother, this resulted in conflict for me. (And after being with kids for these past 8 years, neither is accurate!) And when I read that people are doing both, I think it&#39;s ignorance, and that they haven&#39;t delved into the theory of either method.</div>
<div><br></div><div>As far as our family is concerned, the curriculums were all done selfishly for me. It was for me to feel like I was actively, providing this excellent well-rounded atmosphere. In fact, I spent more time making things, reading things, etc. than actually spending time being WITH my kids. They snubbed their noses at most of what I made, and at first I was determined to make something else, something else that would entice them. Concurrently, our daughter would ask very in-depth questions about the body, and my husband would be deeply entrenched answering her questions, reading her books, and quenched her thirst.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br></div><div>When I read that someone is unschooling in a certain style or adding math/ english, etc. curriculums here and there, I think a few things, 1. that they are in the infancy of unschooling, it has peaked their interest, yet they don&#39;t really know much yet, or 2. that they will not let go, or are afraid to. And they may/ may not ever let go or 3. that they do not fully understand it and are trying to define what they are doing to others and/ or themselves. Unfortunately, in all cases, the lines get blurred for newly exposed people. It&#39;s simple, a defined unschool is an oxymoron.</div>
<div><br></div><div>Stephanie</div><div><br></div><div>I found a cute quote the other day, something like this: &quot;I want to be the perfect parent, but I&#39;m too busy spending the days with my children.&quot;&nbsp;</div><div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1062263366">I have a mom friend (though our friendship has become a bit strained) who considers herself a &quot;Waldorf Unschooler&quot; because she has her kids at home and has stopped doing any curriculum work with them (and only because she didn&#39;t want to put the effort in anymore). She says repeatedly that she doesn&#39;t actually like to be with her kids and has no interest &quot;wasting her time&quot; playing with them. They are only allowed wooden/wool/silk toys, zero electronic media, and the Legos they have been gifted (which they ADORE) have been banished from the house. <br/>
<br/>
The mom has now joined the local unschoolers group that we belong to, and we meet at a park most weeks.  I am having a hard time not feeling upset about it. Her kids are so hungry for attention, and I end up playing with them (along with my two youngest) the whole time I&#39;m there. I adore them, and we have great fun, but I can see that I am the only adult that actually plays with and engages them, and I get angry and sad when I see her chatting up a storm with any mom she can, ignoring her kids unless I (or another adult) call out and say they need her. I don&#39;t really know any other kids who are controlled as much as hers, and their whole situation is so far from what I know (and love) of unschooling.  I am on a journey and am learning so much everyday, looking at and letting go of old patterns of thought and action; I mess up lots!

I have had to cut back on the times we have them over just because it is really difficult to be the only engaged adult (especially since I have an adventurous toddler in the mix), but I think if I stage it as &quot;Hey, look at this!

I should have added that a big part of the frustration comes from this friend asking me repeatedly for advice and then telling me she doesn&#39;t like it (sometimes in a pretty aggressive manner) even though I pretty much have been saying similar stuff for a year. I&#39;m trying to think of it like the way I and my kids learn: if she keeps asking , she must be trying to hear in some way, right?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1954836084">Sometimes it helps (as someone said in here, sort of) to say something glowing about their child.  Not in a manipulative way to make the mom feel guilty, but say &quot;I was playing with [Bob] and he was very gentle with my kitten&quot; or &quot;She&#39;s such a good artist&quot; or &quot;He was really helpful today&quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t know if you know how much she knows about fashion.  I was surprised!&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2082866263">Thanks so much for sharing your good thinking with me, everyone. I have taken away so much to reflect upon, and have been spent the past two days doing just that. The challenges I have in this relationship have become more clear, as have my reasons for staying with it and my motivation for working to support this family. <br/>
<br/>
I am so grateful for the honesty that I find here, for the mirrors that are held up for those of us seeking answers to look into. It occurs to me that support is so often perceived as hand holding, an assuaging of feelings, a reassurance that we are doing just fine. And sometimes that is what support looks like. But this, this here... Honesty: people willing to take the time to notice, and the courage to point out, the snags in our thinking so that we may find clarity and move closer to the relationships we want with our families... This is amazing support. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-424432339"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I should have added that a big part of the frustration comes from this friend asking me repeatedly for advice and then telling me she doesn&#39;t like it (sometimes in a pretty aggressive manner) even though I pretty much have been saying similar stuff for a year. I&#39;m trying to think of it like the way I and my kids learn: if she keeps asking , she must be trying to hear in some way, right?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I get asked questions sometimes too, and often there seems to be some resentment to the answers I offer.  (Maybe it&#39;s my delivery.)  It has been my experience in these situations that sitting quietly helps.  Sometimes I can&#39;t help myself and I cringe at something that is said, but mostly I sit quietly.  I don&#39;t agree or disagree.  I give the mom room to come to her own conclusions.  I don&#39;t see it as my job to convince anyone my answer is more correct than theirs. <br/>
<br/>
I find if I start talking about how great my son is, the mom gets defensive of her perceived need to complain.  Same seems to be true if I try to suggest other ways of thinking in that moment.    <br/>
<br/>
Then in all other moments I do my best to be the best mom and unschooler I can be - for myself, for my son and for my husband - with the knowledge that my example might give someone some ideas on how to see and try things a bit differently themselves.  I am constantly looking for examples to grow myself.  I absolutely love it when I see someone do something that I think I&#39;d like to try.  Sometimes it&#39;s a sweet gesture or phrase.  Sometimes it&#39;s a cool project or idea.  <br/>
<br/>
I try to keep in mind that I learn best when given the room to grow and the trust that I want to do better, and do my best to extend that courtesy to others.<br/>
<br/>
