 </span></blockquote>&quot;My only thought is if you have a chiropractor that you trust or can get <br/>
a<br/>
good reccomendation I would consult with them.  If it&#39;s muscles there <br/>
may<br/>
not be anything they can do, but if he moved and something moved out of<br/>
alignment that could be helped.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
I swear by my chiro too.  Even if it is muscles, they could be in spasm from the misalignment of the vertebrae.  My chiro practices &quot;Network Spinal Analysis&quot; which is a gentle, no-velocity adjustment.  Totally non-frightening.  With a one-finger, light touch, he brings the body&#39;s attention to the misalignment and it realigns itself.  It releases the tension of the body being in trauma so that the body can proceed with restoring wellness, which is what it&#39;s naturally wired to do all the time.  <br/>
 <br/>
My chiro doesn&#39;t require x-rays and there are practitioners of Network all over the country.  It&#39;s the latest advancement in chiropractic care.  (I&#39;m not getting a free toaster oven or anything for this endorsement!)<br/>
