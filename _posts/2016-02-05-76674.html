<div id="ygrps-yiv-401814980">So we just moved 1300 km across state.. and this year my daughter who is 10 and has never been to school wants to do school at home homeschool using a distance education curriculum (her cousins do this as they live in remote property in Australia this School of the Air (distance education) is seen as a necessity and it&#39;s not a freely made choice - almost if not all mothers doing this on their sheep or cattle stations would choose a physical school is they could).<br/>
<br/>
Now I understand that unschooling is about following your child&#39;s desires and interests and this is a strong desire. I think it&#39;s to fit in or to make sure she&#39;s covered in case she&#39;s tested and she is also aware that if she wants to be a vet (if she&#39;s not a professional ballerina) she needs to cover maths etc. at university. I asked her if she would like to go to school but she definitely does not. <br/>
<br/>
I know I am going to have to push her everyday to complete the book work in this program which his against all the unschooling principles I have been working on these last two years (prior to that we did a smattering or curriculum, a bit if which - a handwriting book - which she dragged out of one of the many cardboard boxes lying about last night and got to work). <br/>
<br/>
I have suggested we just do mathusee or some other type of schooly thing by ourselves if she wants to experience what school is. But she wants to enroll in this school of distance education. I think it&#39;s so she can get best of both worlds.<br/>
<br/>
Do you think I should flow with this? I just want to unschool! Maybe I am just really failing at this gig and so she reckons school work would be more fun than hanging out on her ipad or watching movies or ding video games. I don&#39;t quite get it!</div>

We have been exploring and choosing new dance school, gymnastics and guides - all the familiar activities in a newer bigger version (we have moved from outback remote smallish town to the sunshine coast in queensland where we have massive plethora of choice of anything we could want to participate in, see or do all of a sudden, relative to where we have been). I am doing alot to find fun things in amongst the unpacking and settling into our new home.

How can you?  Your flow is all stuck. :-)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
-=-she reckons school work would be more fun than hanging out on her ipad or watching movies or doing video games.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Is ALL she does at home is play by herself and watch movies?  If so, you should be doing more.  <br/>
But if she does have lots of options and school looks good, and she doesn’t need to physically go to school, and you don’t care if she gets good grades or not, and it’s not expensive, what are you worried that it will hurt?<br/>
<br/>
Not letting her do it could hurt much more.  One of the worst things about school is the lack of choice.  Don’t bring that home and give them no choice but to be homeschooled. <br/>
<br/>
-=-I don&#39;t quite get it!-=-<br/>
<br/>
Because you started before Pam Laricchia created her intro, and because you’re not quite getting it, it might be worth reading that. It’s on the sidebar here, and there are a couple of things I said in that interview that could apply to what you’ve asked above, too.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://livingjoyfully.ca/blog/2016/02/eu005-ten-questions-with-sandra-dodd/">http://livingjoyfully.ca/blog/2016/02/eu005-ten-questions-with-sandra-dodd/</a><br/>
<br/>
Lots of unschooled kids have tried school a while, learned a lot (about school and themselves and the advantages of being home, maybe) and most come back home.  I think it’s most.  Maybe we just don’t hear about the ones who stay there.<br/>
<br/>
There’s another thing you could do, about school.  She could share her lessons with the whole family (any who are interested) and you could discuss the lessons just as you might a youtube video.  It would help her understand them, and the knowledge of the lesson, and of school’s current methods (it might be more progressive than you’re imagining)—your whole family would learn more, and it would be a social thing.  Your description above sounds like there’s insufficient interplay among family members, and it would be cool if this interest of hers could hep.<br/>

<br/>
I hope you don’t try to talk her out of something she’s so excited about.<br/>
If it’s like oldtime “school of the air,” it would need to be at the same time for everyone, but I’m guessing it’s modern internet school of the air and not radio, right?  So can’t she work her lessons around activities with dance or unschooling friends?<br/>

Moving is one of the biggest stress factors for anyone, child OR adult.  If she’s found something that will help her make the adjustment, that’s wonderful.  And if it can be of interest or a distraction to anyone else in the family, too, that would probably serve to help cushion the change as well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2030628891">I like Sylvia’s response—partly because it’s kinda like mine! ;-)<br/>
I responded before seeing there was another response.  I think it’s good when the same idea comes up twice.<br/>
<br/>
And it can help for the person with the question to look at how what she wrote was seen.  If the iPad and movies isn’t all the child is doing, why did the mom describe it that way?  Those are deeper questions for individuals to deal with at home. :-)   Each person is different in what she fears or prizes or is surprised by.<br/>

I think she is possibly excited by the accountability part in fact. She likes to sleep in so she&#39;s already decided that she will do her school work in the afternoon before dance/guides which this year fall quite late in the day. It will be an interesting experience. She will need help because we obviously have not been ticking curriculum standard boxes the last few years and no I am not in the least concerned about grades nor will it be an issue to stop when she&#39;s had enough as I can pay term by term. It is a different empowered approach compared with how I used to try and do homeschool before we began unschooling when I felt compelled to tick the boxes. I think it could be frustrating when we come across the plethora of schooly work that seems uninteresting or a waste of time.

Couldn’t you back down on that?<br>
What “required” is there?<br>
What would it hurt if she “failed” or did just some of the assignments and didn’t “work”?<br>
And why is it a “we”?  Do the parents sign a form agreeing to be the enforcers?<br>
<br>

If you didn’t read the links I sent (it didn’t seem there was time, between that post and the response), could you please do that?  You don’t need to report back, but your response above doesn’t seem to be informed by or affected by the  “Public School on your own terms” page, which is very short.<br>

I didn’t know it was going to cost money to sign up with that school.  I hope it’s not very much money.<br>

<br/>
I think The Netherlands is the only place with that scary little quirk in their laws.<br/>
<br/>
KGHarriman is in Queensland, in Australia, and I’m pretty sure it’s not a problem there.  But YES, everyone should know the laws and not try to learn them here!  Things change (and they’re changing in The Netherlands, right this season, whether for better or worse isn’t yet known).<br/>
<br/>
This discussion should be about how natural learning works, and so discussion how one kid using a curriculum while other kids are not can be legitimate, lightly, if the focus is on the effect on unschooling. :-)<br/>

<br/>
In some jurisdictions, kids who are “too far behind” aren’t allowed to keep unschooling because the state figures they need special education, or that the parent isn’t doing a sufficieint job.  If there’s no such law where you are, no problem.  In a few places where tests are required, if the score is very low the parents might have a year to “catch up” or they might be supervised or something.  Laws change, and I can’t say where that might be true now, but that (I think) was the intent of the question.  <br/>
<br/>
Know your local laws.  If there are any legal risks to enrolling, that should be a factor.  I think that’s probably what was meant.<br/>
