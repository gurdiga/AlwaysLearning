<div id="ygrps-yiv-98818953">&#39;Mystery, Alaska&#39; is a really good, and really snowy<br/>
movie.<br/>
&#39;While You Were Sleeping&#39; takes place in winter also.<br/>
&#39;White Fang&#39;<br/>
&#39;Muppet Christmas Carol&#39; or pretty much any Christmas<br/>
movie.<br/>
<br/>
I know there must be tons more, but I can&#39;t think of<br/>
any.  Sorry if a very similar version to this message<br/>
comes through also.  The first one didn&#39;t appear to go<br/>
through, but it may mysteriously appear and make me<br/>
look redundant.<br/>
