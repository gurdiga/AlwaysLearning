&gt; forget what, raincoats, I think--cutting with an electric cutter through <br/>
&gt; piles of fabric), or Fig Newtons...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We said maybe she would get bored after half a day.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She named some other factories.  The other kids who were with us had seen <br/>
&gt; those shows too.  I had seen a couple of them.  And I told them about the <br/>
&gt; Levi&#39;s factory I had been in one time to deliver something, and had walked <br/>
&gt; by <br/>
&gt; piles of pockets, piles of back left leg...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But ultimately I said I thought maybe what she wanted to do when she grew <br/>
&gt; up <br/>
&gt; was to watch Mr. Rogers&#39; factory tour videos!<br/>

using a hook to grab dough that didn&#39;t shape right from the assembly line. We <br/>
thought that would be a fun job...for about half an hour. We started to think <br/>
about all the jobs in the world that would be fun for  about that amount of <br/>
time, then be deadly.<br/>
