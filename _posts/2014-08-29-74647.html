<div id="ygrps-yiv-775634670"><p>Hello,&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>My son has just turned six. He&#39;s been in school since January this year (his choice) and has recently decided he wants to homeschool. He&#39;s finishing up the last few weeks of term due to my work commitments and then he&#39;ll be home with me. I&#39;m due to give birth in October so we have spoken about how things will be quite low key after the baby comes and I will probably be quite tired. I&#39;ve got my mum coming for six weeks around my due date (all our family live overseas) and she&#39;ll be happy to hang out with Jack so that will hopefully smooth the transition somewhat. I also figure that after eight months in school he&#39;s going to be really happy chilling out at home.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>I do want to have some other activities on hand though because while he has his favourite things to do (watch gamers on YouTube, play Wii U, play Lego, Minecraft, watch videos, drawing) there are moments that he gets bored and wants suggestions for new things to do. I am a bit worried that I will not have the time or the head space to keep things interesting for him. Does anyone have suggestions for how I can plan for these moments to keep home sparkly and fun while also giving me enough time to rest and care for a newborn?&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Thank you,&nbsp;</p><p>Keelie</p><p>Melbourne</p><p>DS1 6 yrs</p><p>DS2 in utero</p></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1277841196">We just got some kinetic sand and my girls (7 and 5) are loving it. &nbsp;I really like it too, it&#39;s very soothing, and it doesn&#39;t dry out the way play dough does. &nbsp;My 7 year old is finding it particularly fascinating.</div>
