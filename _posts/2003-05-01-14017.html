A friend just sent this to me.  It has little to do with anything, except I <br/>
have always loved religious music and this has some particularly good stuff.  <br/>
 It has more than one kind of MIDI thing on some, and the words are there, <br/>
and the versions are long enough to sing four verses WITH an intro and it has <br/>
Dona Nobis Pacem (an old round) and lots of music stuff.  It&#39;s really <br/>
wonderful and has four part harmonies...  <br/>
<br/>
Wowie.  Even if you&#39;re not into church music, there will be some stuff there <br/>
you might like.  In the Christmas section they have some things which are <br/>
traditional and have only become well known in the past few decades.  Newish <br/>
two or three hundred year old songs. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It has &quot;Be Thou My Vision,&quot; one of the best songs ever.<br/>
<br/>
Though the site seems liturgically Catholic, the music is mixed, and there&#39;s <br/>
a fair amount of it! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Do the links ever work for anybody?  Like this one:&lt;A <br/>
