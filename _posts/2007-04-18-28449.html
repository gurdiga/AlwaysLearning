<div id="ygrps-yiv-1619150159">When my oldest son attended the (almost 60 year old) freeschool, Play  <br/>
Mountain Place, 11 years ago, their workshops and materials for  <br/>
parents were all called Peaceful Parenting and had been for many  <br/>
years - I still have the booklet with the title.  Oh, looks like they  <br/>
are still calling it that, see here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://playmountain.org/">http://playmountain.org/</a> <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1012504258">I checked, she did register the name &quot;peaceful parenting&quot;.  Although, <br/>
I&#39;m not sure how she did it with so many people before her already <br/>
using it.  It was a bad choice on her end to use such common language <br/>
that others had already used to make books, presentation, and other <br/>
informative things.  Then to turn around and ask everyone to stop using <br/>
it because it now belongs to her.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I find it morally and ethically repugnant, but laws don&#39;t <br/>
recognize my feelings on the matter!<br/>
<br/>
Honestly Sandra, you do so much to help people parent more peacefully, <br/>
than that woman ever will.  While, she may help a few, she charges <br/>
money for a product that is readily available for free from many <br/>
sources all over the internet and in many many books.  This kind of <br/>
thing really gets to me.<br/>
<br/>
All this has suddenly spurned an interest in your tape that may become <br/>
illegal to call peaceful parenting.  I think I just may order one of <br/>
those tapes.  Do you have any left?  If you like you could just give it <br/>
to me for free and I just may send you a really &quot;nice&quot; card, that just <br/>
might have a &quot;nice&quot; gift in it.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-145156573">below is what i copied from the page-you can see she was approved in 2004. but if you search the copyright she published her book in 2000 but in 2002 another book with the SAME title was published! obviously she waited another year before TM it! <br/>
<br/>
but if you read the email i sent before you can see via the copyright office website-an article/periodical can&#39;t copyright a title....<br/>
<br/>
realistically she will have to sue a bit of people to stop using the title as its popular/common and BEFORE her TM... so she really doesn&#39;t have the right to use it!<br/>

anyhow you can find it when you search here <br/>

Well darn her.  She&#39;s evil.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for finding that.<br/>
<br/>
I think &quot;Peacefully Parenting&quot; sounds dorky, but I need to name the  <br/>
talk something, the talk that&#39;s already scheduled for the HSC  <br/>
conference.<br/>
Parenting in Peace doesn&#39;t mean quite the same thing at all. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Personally I think trademarking common language really stinks, <br/>
especially as it makes for awkward usage of language to avoid the use <br/>
of a trademarked word or phrase that would otherwise be the best <br/>
choice of wording.<br/>
<br/>
Microsoft is really bad at trademarking common words and phrases.  <br/>
Actually they are just really bad at lots of things that infringe on <br/>
the daily lives of people using computers.  That&#39;s really a whole <br/>
other can of worms though.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just the general idea that someone like that woman can use a <br/>
common phrase and corner the market on peaceful parenting and claim <br/>
that others can&#39;t use it because she owns it.  I personally believe <br/>
she does not, whether the law says she does or not.  I know I&#39;m not <br/>
alone in this belief.  I think I may even just start heading pages in <br/>
my blog with that term, just because I&#39;m onery.</div>

you have a large following of folks or anything.  Because that would <br/>

I wonder how many people she is going after?  There are soooo many <br/>
