Some children in some parts of the world are even nowadays. My mother-in-law was my biggest supporter in breastfeeding. She is sure my husband would have died if she had not breastfed in the early months because milk was not available.<br/>

mouth---the origin of the kiss. Animals will do this too---to a further <br/>
degree---and regurgitate the partially digested food for their young. So, <br/>
really, no blenders were needed! :-) (ever wonder why your dog licks your <br/>
face?)<br/>

at 4-5 weeks; 6 at the latest. Their adult teeth begin to come in @ 4 months. <br/>
Big cats are starting the weaning process @ 4-6 weeks when the mom starts <br/>
regurgitating meat for them, and are weaned at 5-6 months. <br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;d waited until Cameron&#39;s adult teeth started to come in, he&#39;d&#39;ve been <br/>
8!!! (he&#39;s 14, and they&#39;re not all in!)<br/>

anyone with a mortar and pestle can make mush out of vegetables or fruit.<br/>
