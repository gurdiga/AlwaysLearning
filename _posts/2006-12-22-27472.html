<br/>
I was reminded of my uber-geekiness. Harry Potter and<br/>
the Dangerous Hallows is the totally stupid name of<br/>
JK&#39;s last (weep) and probably longest Potter book.<br/>
Why uber geek?<br/>
Because I must dissect the name. Dangerous Hallows.<br/>
What does it mean?<br/>
My first thought was that it deals with locations.<br/>
Godric&#39;s Hallow is where Harry&#39;s parents lived and<br/>
died when he was an infant. Could the graveyard where<br/>
they are buried also<br/>
have &quot;hallows&quot; in its name? Will the final battle be<br/>
fought in Godric&#39;s Hallow?<br/>
Will Snape be allowed to live?<br/>
Probably not.<br/>
Damn you JKR for your obvious Snape hate.<br/>

Eeek.<br/>
Let the woman write.<br/>
<br/>
The American name of the first book is the totally stupid name.  They  <br/>
should&#39;ve just let the woman write instead of making an international  <br/>
admission that editors at Scholastic Books were too lazy and  <br/>
parochial to know (or look up) enough medieval history to *get* the  <br/>
title, so they blackmailed her by saying &quot;We&#39;ll publish it in the  <br/>
U.S. if you let us change the title and re-edit the text.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Those days are gone (or mostly so), so I&#39;m happy with whatever  <br/>
happens past that.<br/>

She created him.  She can hate what she wants.  But I don&#39;t think she  <br/>
hates him a bit.<br/>

Only this, which is still worth thinking about:<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was with you, until i realized that the title is Dangerous <br/>
Hallows. hAllows. Not hOllows. Its Godric&#39;s Hollow.<br/>
<br/>
Hallows, according to dictionary.com means:<br/>
<br/>
1. to make holy; sanctify; consecrate.  <br/>
2. to honor as holy; consider sacred; venerate: to hallow a <br/>
battlefield.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When i first heard the title, i thought &quot;Huh? Thats not a good one. <br/>
Its sounds kind of...stupid.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But when i realized that Dangerous Hallows means, basically making <br/>
something holy, and the danger that could result. That opens it up <br/>
to so many interpretations....about all of the loyalties, vows, <br/>
sacrifices and alliances throughout the series and the resulting <br/>
tragedies. Maybe it refers to how, when we put *anyone* up on a <br/>
pedestal (whether its Harry, or Voldemort, or even Dumbledore), that <br/>
we will be, at best disappointed when they fall, or worse, at their <br/>
very mercy when we disappoint *them.*<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think she hates Snape. I think she has, throughout the <br/>
series, portrayed Snape as a very sympathetic character. He has <br/>
sacrificed his whole life for the cause and in the end may die for <br/>
it (many believe.) JKR has given the world a gift in the character <br/>
of Snape,and i for one am grateful. <br/>
<br/>
I saw a cool movie on YouTube:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jOmemLpcv0">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jOmemLpcv0</a><br/>
<br/>
I really think the author has a point, when it comes to that spell <br/>
of being able to bring out the spirits of the people a wand has <br/>
killed (in GOF, Harry got to talk to his parents this way, <br/>
remember?)...usually JK doesnt just mention something once, it shows <br/>
up again in a later book. So, when Harry, Ron, and Hermione used <br/>
PollyJuice Potion in CoS, it showed up again in GoF. I think this <br/>
spell (cant remember the name)will show up again, and as the author <br/>
of the YouTube Movie says, will allow Harry to talk to Dumbledore <br/>
once more (or...if you think Dumbys not really dead, will allow him <br/>
to talk to Snape.)<br/>
<br/>
I also read a really really great theory on the Harry Potter for <br/>
Grownups list, which states that Peter Pettigrew will have an <br/>
important role in the last book. Remember, in PoA, that Harry spared <br/>
Peter&#39;s life. He owes Harry a Life Debt. Dumbledore made a big deal <br/>
about that, about telling Harry how significant that is. Then (i <br/>
*think* in GoF??)Voldemort cuts off PP&#39;s hand, and then gives him a <br/>
really strong silver one. Again, significance of that not really <br/>
mentioned at the time. It MUST surface again in this book, otherwise <br/>
why put it in? <br/>
<br/>
So the theory goes like this: JK has stated (and i think Dumbledore <br/>
has also stated)that the prophecy is written very specifically. <br/>
Words were chosen carefully. The theorist says if you look at the <br/>
part of the prophecy which reads:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live <br/>
while the other survives&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That is is totally plausible the &quot;the hand of the other&quot; is the <br/>
silver hand of the other person standing there, Peter Pettigrew. I <br/>
can picture the scene...Voldemort has Harry in a precarious <br/>
position, he can kill him, (or vice versa), and PP has a choice to <br/>
make. Help Voldemort, or help Harry. He&#39;s loyal to V, he&#39;s afraid of <br/>
him, he&#39;s a coward. But...he owes harry that life debt. Time to <br/>
collect. Maybe that crazy silver hand is enough to kill Voldemort, <br/>
maybe it will crush the last needed Horcrux. Who knows. I&#39;m sure JK <br/>
can write it out better than i can. <br/>
<br/>
Personally, i can&#39;t wait to &quot;see&quot; the look on Harry&#39;s face when he <br/>
finds out that Snape sacrificed his whole life, holed up in Hogwarts <br/>
with kids he can&#39;t stand, working for Voldemort, etc, just to try to <br/>
make up for what he did to Lily. That he wasnt the enemy after all, <br/>
and that all of Harry&#39;s hatred for him was misplaced. Serves him <br/>
right for judging poor Snape!&lt;g&gt;<br/>

I don&#39;t remember what the original Brit title  was, only that I knew what it <br/>
meant - at the age I was at that reading level I  knew what it meant. I *do* <br/>
remember a previous discussion about Brit phraseology  and slang and how some <br/>
was changed in American printings-does your last sentence  mean that they&#39;ve <br/>
done away with that? I&#39;ve never read a work of a print book,  as I&#39;ve &quot;read&quot; all <br/>
6 on audio book, and I&#39;ve been wondering if they did Brit and  US versions of <br/>
the audio books since there were a couple words I actually had to  look <br/>
up-being unable to define them through context. And &quot;snogging&quot; is seriously  stuck <br/>
in my head, now. <br/>

Thank you for sharing this link! I hadn&#39;t  followed previous conversations <br/>
very closely, as I was not up to date, but I  just finished #6 last week, so its <br/>
very good to take part in *current* dialogue.  VERY interesting theories! <br/>
I&#39;ve not got any ideas, myself, but I do know that  things in certain places <br/>
&quot;felt&quot; wrong. As I put the last CD back in the box, the  idea popped hugely into <br/>
my head that Snape wanted Lily and *that* was the whole  basis for the <br/>
animosity between he and  James. Also, I wholeheartedly agree  with the phoenix idea <br/>
mentioned there by Betsy. That was one of my  strongest &quot;objection&quot; thoughts to <br/>
his death-though, gullible as I am, when the  portrait showed up, I <br/>
immediately accepted that he was definitely dead. Thanks  for all the reasons to doubt <br/>
it!<br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>
