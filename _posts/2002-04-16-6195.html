<div id="ygrps-yiv-350614488">&quot;School days&quot; is too weird a concept.  <br/>
<br/>
Tell him you&#39;re going to have 365 learning days and no school days.<br/>
If school-style works, why isn&#39;t your son in school?<br/>
Ask your husband if he would build a factory to make one chair, one car, one <br/>
computer. <br/>
