<div id="ygrps-yiv-1598490240">Hi, here&#39;s a wonderful part of my bedtime and intellectual life since <br/>
my daughter was born -<br/>
<br/>
I have a backlit Palm-type device.  It is lightweight and I can hold it <br/>
in one hand.  I can turn it to dim but still very readable so it <br/>
doesn&#39;t bother anyone and here&#39;s some of what I can do on it as my <br/>
daughter sleeps by my side - I can read novels - probably about 25 of <br/>
them in the two years since she was born, I can do crossword puzzles, I <br/>
can read the New York Times Book Review and many other daily and weekly <br/>
periodicals.  I can plan my week on the calendar, I can keep a journal <br/>
of the new words she said today for the first time, I can look over my <br/>
address book and see whom I want to call and get together with.  I can <br/>
draw color pictures.  I can make a shopping list by checking off items <br/>
on my pre-developed shopping list.  I can look up movie reviews and <br/>
times to see on my next free afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
It was not hard to learn how to use it - anyone who has managed to <br/>
learn how to send and receive email and join a Yahoo list can do this.  <br/>
I can even read articles off websites or emails that I have copied and <br/>
pasted into my Palm for later.  This is not a plug for any particular <br/>
brand of device - but be sure you get a backlit one so you can use it <br/>
in the dark, and if you can afford it, I encourage you to consider the <br/>
extra maybe $50 for color.  And I do this lying down, cozy, nestled in <br/>
bed, with the light off, with my daughter and husband asleep beside me. <br/>
  Then when I am falling asleep, I tuck into the pillow case of the <br/>
pillow next to me, so that it doesn&#39;t fall on the floor, and so Miranda <br/>
can&#39;t play with it while I&#39;m still asleep.  Does anyone else here use <br/>
one?<br/>

  My dh and I both have hand helds and we love them.  I have the bookworm game on mine that I love to play.  My dh can even load movies on his  for trips to the dr that will have a long wait in the waiting room or something like that.  He also has games on it that my 10 yr. old can play, so he can always hand it to him to use as well.  Amazing little devices.  He even has programs loaded on his that he uses at work as a nurse, such as drug guides and conversion charts.  There are tons of free programs and downloads he finds all the time to add to his.  <br/>

Can you share with us some of the free downloads? Thanks so much I got one for Christmas a last year and would love to start to &quot;really&quot; use it and free ebooks or games would be GREAT!<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1856421752">This sounds wonderful, I would certainly find that useful.<br/>
 <br/>
I think the initial question was asking for something slightly different though - more to do with the reasons a child might not want to go to bed with one parent while the other was still downstairs?<br/>
 <br/>
I can only speak from personal experience, that is my own outlook as opposed to my childs. My son is three and (so far) I take him to bed when he is ready to go, lie with him until he goes to sleep and then go back downstairs to spend some time with my partner. (Like Jay I sometimes fall asleep while I&#39;m up there!) <br/>
What I would like to suggest is that, with a slightly older child, there may be an element of thinking they are &#39;missing something&#39; (for want of a better way of expressing it). I know that if I go to bed on my own I will never settle enough to go to sleep, in fact often get anxious and irritable wondering what my partner is doing and how long it will be before he comes up to bed. So much so that I also &#39;fight myself&#39; in order to stay downstairs until he is also ready to sleep!<br/>
 <br/>
Don&#39;t know if this is of any significance (other than perhaps indicating my own neurosis!).<br/>
 <br/>
Bright Blessings, Bev x.<br/>

<br/>
Are you asking Bev if the experience of your older one is a feeling of void<br/>
because he isn&#39;t with his family in bed? Kindof like what you feel when your<br/>
partner&#39;s not there?<br/>
<br/>
If so, I just thought that I&#39;d relate that for us, our kids were the same<br/>
way you describe yours being at their age, but now enjoy their space, and<br/>
sometimes will sleep with us, but more often do not. Even though they didn&#39;t<br/>
want to go to bed alone back then, as they got older and their peers took on<br/>
a greater importance to them, they slept anywhere fine. You are not<br/>
fostering an unhealthy dependence imo by catering to your guys at bedtime. I<br/>
do think that you are building their foundation of security.<br/>
<br/>
Though I may be misinterpreting what you are saying to start with. Sorry if<br/>
that&#39;s the case!<br/>

audible books on my little mini-MP3 player. I keep it next to my bed <br/>
and if I wake up with RLS symptoms, my first line of defense is to <br/>
start listening to a book (sometimes the distraction is enough that I <br/>
can relax and fall back asleep).<br/>

Anyway - those of you still needing to lie down with younger kids could <br/>
do that - I hit the bookmark button every once in a while so that I can <br/>
get back to the last place I was before I fell asleep &lt;G&gt;. I got my <br/>
mp3/audible book player free when I joined audible com, by the way.<br/>
