<div id="ygrps-yiv-1354860531">My kids are going on a field trip in a couple of weeks and we were given<br/>
about 4 pages of questions for the kids to answer.  These were put together<br/>
by the place that&#39;s doing the field trip.  I&#39;m sure they thought they were<br/>
doing us a favor and being very helpful... I just looked at them and thought<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t think we need to be testing them on what plants they saw and what<br/>
colors they are&quot;... It will be interesting to see whether anyone whips that<br/>
out while on this trip as we are not just unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Another incident today occurred when I was taking Zak to the Theatre (they<br/>
have a matinee series for schools).  We go as a homeschooling group....<br/>
Someone asked Zak if he was homeschooled and he said &quot;yes&quot; they then asked<br/>
what grade he said &quot;no grade I&#39;m homeschooled&quot;... &quot;Oh&quot; she said &quot;you don&#39;t<br/>
do grades, how sweet&quot; (in a condenscending manner).... I smiled and said<br/>
NOTHING...what an accomplishment for me....<br/>
<br/>
There were tons of kids there all in a row, being told to stand still, be<br/>
quiet, stop talking, stay in line (this is outside the theatre)... Lots of<br/>
uniforms and 2 grown ups to about 20 kids, which I&#39;m told is good (whatever<br/>
that means)...<br/>
<br/>
Zak enjoyed Ballet Hispanico for a while and then asked when the acrobats<br/>
were coming on (a recent theatre trip).. when I told him that this was a<br/>
different show he said he&#39;d stay but would prefer the acrobats.  I gave him<br/>
the option of leaving, but he didn&#39;t want to... I thought about how those<br/>
other kids don&#39;t have that choice if they don&#39;t like it.<br/>

We went to the Monterey Bay Aquarium on Friday and there were a few<br/>
<br/>
school groups there. I noticed that one of the groups had handed<br/>
<br/>
out notebooks with questions that their students needed to answer.<br/>
<br/>
I thought how sad that those children couldn&#39;t just relax and enjoy<br/>
<br/>
the place. My children learn so much every time we visit - they<br/>
<br/>
had to show Rob all their favorite places - he&#39;s been working too<br/>
<br/>
much lately and hasn&#39;t been able to go with us. Rob and I were<br/>
<br/>
much more relaxed when all the school groups left. I don&#39;t think<br/>
<br/>
Megan and Alex even noticed them - the aquarium is much too interesting<br/>
<br/>
for them!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-716013547">Interesting thread.<br/>
<br/>
A few weeks ago my Girl Scout assistant leader was doing a project with the<br/>
girls in which they were acting out scenes and showing how they would deal<br/>
with various difficult situations. One group of girls was handed the scene,<br/>
&quot;Your friend is worried about failing a test, how would you help her?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Picture Pam taking a befuddled Brittany by the hand to deliver a 30 second<br/>
whispered informative lecture on what the heck a TEST is. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And then recently Brit said, &quot;Miranda&#39;s Mom says she&#39;s grounded. What&#39;s<br/>
grounded?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I answered, &quot;It&#39;s barbaric, that&#39;s what it is.&quot; &lt;g&gt; Brit wished for a more<br/>
complete explanation so I filled her in...<br/>

she is just the coolest kid. She is also being grounded right and left. So, <br/>
Casey thought it sounded oh so cool. She was insisting that I ground her <br/>
there for awhile so that she could be like Gabrielle.<br/>
