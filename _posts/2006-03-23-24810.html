 </span></blockquote>People assume that teaching causes learning, like it is part of the third <br/>
law of motion (for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction) or <br/>
something. Teaching doesn&#39;t make someone learn.  Learning is a totally <br/>
independent function from teaching.<br/>
<br/>
If the model of the third law of motion were true in this case, then I <br/>
think the reaction to teaching is definitely not learning, but <br/>
*resistance*.  That would be the first law of motion, involving <br/>
inertia.  Students stop trying to learn on their own because they have been <br/>
conditioned to believe they can&#39;t.  (Man, Newton was really smart! LOL!)<br/>
<br/>
And that resistance will definitely grow stronger with the application of <br/>
more teaching.<br/>
<br/>
Learning is an individual, internal process that takes place in a person&#39;s <br/>
brain as information is sought and applied and connections made.  That is <br/>
why no state has compulsory education laws, but rather compulsory <br/>
*attendance*.  No one can force another to learn.<br/>
<br/>
If your daughter wants to learn to knit, she will seek out <br/>
information.  She will ask questions, ask you to show her.  She will watch <br/>
and listen, and take it with her and apply it in her own fashion.  She <br/>
might use you as a resource, she might not.  She might just look it up on <br/>
the internet or in a book.  Did the internet or the book teach her to <br/>
knit?  No, she learned it on her own.  If you try to be more than the <br/>
internet in the process, you will remove the responsibility of learning <br/>
from her and take on the responsibility of &quot;teaching her how&quot;.  Even the <br/>
process of learning something is showing her how to learn other future things.<br/>

&quot;Real, natural learning is in the living. It&#39;s in the observing, the <br/>
questioning, the examining, the pondering, the analyzing, the watching, the <br/>
reading, the DO-ing, the living, the breathing, the loving, the Joy. It&#39;s <br/>
in the Joy.&quot; ~Anne Ohman<br/>
