<div id="ygrps-yiv-1289146307">****I used it to make magnetic paper dolls for my girls.  We have<br/>
elaborate<br/>
rooms (full sheets) on the frig with paper dolls and their clothes.  I<br/>
got the dolls off a website.****<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much for this idea. My kids and I love paper dolls, but<br/>
they rip so easily.  I had the magnetic David and Venus on the fridge<br/>
for a long time,  but the kids loved them to death.<br/>
<br/>
I just ordered printable magnetic sheets from Staples and found a bunch<br/>
of free paper doll (including some boy dolls) sites to download!  We are<br/>
going to have a blast with these.<br/>
<br/>
Also, thanks to the person who gave directions for goop (or whatever it<br/>
was called - was that here or the other group?), my kids and I have been<br/>
having fun with it too.  A little gross for me, but they are loving it -<br/>
so much so that we have run out of food coloring.<br/>
<br/>
I just found out today that there has been enough rain here to fill up<br/>
my favorite swimming hole!  Yea!  So we&#39;ll be spending time out there<br/>
this summer.  The beach, the swimming hole - who needs a pool?<br/>
