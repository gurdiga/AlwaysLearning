<div id="ygrps-yiv-8510168">The past few days have been non-stop for me and it&#39;s fun but  <br/>
confusing.  I don&#39;t think I sent these links to this list, and I  <br/>
meant to.   I had two e-mails about this and it&#39;s very cool:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
============================================<br/>
<br/>
I see that Zachary interviewed you last month (in his footnotes), so  <br/>
it&#39;s likely you&#39;ve seen these.  Just in case you haven&#39;t, here are  <br/>
the links. Your quotes are at the top of his blog post and set the tone:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://zajosa.blogspot.com/">http://zajosa.blogspot.com/</a><br/>
==============================================<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m not sure if Zach sent you his final essays but he gave me  <br/>
permission to post them and I&#39;ve got a link to them on my blog here:  <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.zamunzo.blogspot.com">http://www.zamunzo.blogspot.com</a>   (2nd post down)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;There&#39;s been quite a lot of reaction to it. I haven&#39;t posted about  <br/>
it to any lists so the traffic has been purely blog-word-of-mouth.&quot;<br/>
