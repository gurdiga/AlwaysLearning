<br/>
Many children have grown up isolated in the past--missionaries or  <br/>
pioneers or ranchers.   Perhaps cattle ranches and sheep stations in  <br/>
Australia are the models to look at.  In farming and ranching country,  <br/>
I&#39;ve heard stories of the days when kids only saw other kids at Sunday  <br/>
School, once a week.   Then school and school buses came along.  But  <br/>
in Australia they didn&#39;t gather up all the kids.  They had (might  <br/>
still have) &quot;the school of the air&quot; by radio for isolated kids.  There  <br/>
might be some literature or common knowledge about how those kids did.<br/>
<br/>
I know one family that grew up with few friends other than each other,  <br/>
although there were five of them, the kids.  They were homeschooled.   <br/>
They knew my kids but only saw them a couple of times a year, and a  <br/>
few other families, very infrequently.  They&#39;re fine.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe introduce them to social networks online? I&#39;m 33, but I&#39;m one of those weirdos that&#39;s been on the Internet since the early 90s *g*  so a lot of my friends in &quot;3D&quot; are people I first met online. And I first did that in the era of ubiquitous scare tactics about meeting people from online - everyone was a potential ax murderer!!! (no one ever actually was, of course) - but nowadays it&#39;s totally commonplace. Even online dating has lost a lot of its stigma - even for teens.<br/>
<br/>
My son is very social, but an only child, and desires more friends, so I&#39;m encouraging him to try to talk to people with whom he has a shared interest online. You have to be mindful that some (many) social networks and forums don&#39;t allow kids under 13. Some parents put a false birthday in the birthdate field for their kids&#39; profiles, but that&#39;s up to you. My son really enjoys Skyping with friends and relatives all over the world, as well.<br/>
<br/>
You could try Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, LiveMocha.com is a fun one if there is an interest in languages, Ning.com has a million mini-social networks catering to a lot of different shared interests, there are countless message forums, etc. (LOTS of forums about Yugioh!) With the Internet, it&#39;s not *necessary* to be isolated anymore, even for missionaries and aborigines. :) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-305479625">Home schooling isn&#39;t always enough of a reason to bond. However what <br/>
homeschooling does is (sometimes) create a greater availability for <br/>
playdates and outings because they aren&#39;t doing school all day - unless they <br/>
are.<br/>
<br/>
I think the answers will be - if your kids start wanting more interactions - <br/>
to find clubs based on their interests, and to set them up with skype and <br/>
internet social networks based on their interests.<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of Yu-gi-oh players at the unschooling conferences.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;I know I worry about everything.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What is &quot;everything&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
I have moments of worrying - but they are all grounded in my fears about <br/>
myself - my feared inability to succeed in some way.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I worry that Jayn will be sad or miss out because I&#39;m not able to <br/>
give her something that she wants. Sometimes I worry that she will only <br/>
learn some social things a hard way, from rejection. I&#39;m not a fantastic <br/>
social model for her.<br/>
<br/>
But there are no deep worries, I mean about how she is going to turn out. <br/>
Children manage to survive all kinds of horrible situations - Jayn&#39;s <br/>
situation is not remotely horrible. I&#39;m going out on a limb to imagine that <br/>
these two siblings situation is not remotely horrible either.<br/>
<br/>
How to stop worrying?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe try grounding yourself in knowledge - as you are doing by posting <br/>
here - other examples of people growing up and doing fine.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe really elucidate what the worst is that could happen - and compare it <br/>
to what is happening. What is happening, from your story, looks like two <br/>
close and happy siblings truly enjoying each other.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe take the opportunity to do something with DS if you can when he is <br/>
waiting for his sister.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2138701105">Your kids might be happy the way they are. My nearby niece and nephew grew up with only each other for friends, yet are now lively 20-somethings with many friends and interests, and seemingly healthy connections with people of all ages.  They learned how to be around other teenagers when my sister would go with them to concerts as they grew old enough and were interested, and when they got jobs at the local deli which mainly hired young people.  It was pretty amazing how smoothly they flowed out into the world when they were ready.<br/>
<br/>
If your kids seem to want more friends, they may not need &quot;same age&quot; kids - we posted a sign asking for fellow Yi-Gi-Oh players when we moved to a rural area and my son wanted someone to play with. One boy, younger than we had hoped for, responded.  The two boys did become good friends, and his mom and I recruited other local families (multi-age, home-schooled and not) for activities that seemed fun to our kids.  That informal group is now 5 years old and going strong - maybe you can start something that works for you and your kids, rather than joining a group that doesn&#39;t?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-968962571">When you joined the homeschooling group, did you go multiple times in order for familiarity to work its magic?  Sometimes there are kids that my kids have known as acquaintances for years but some event/conversation/common friend/full moon/etc. will happen and a connection is made.  But these natural hook ups take opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had people visit our group before and expect their children to jump right in, and for the children that know each other to be immediately open to them, and sometimes it happens, but sometimes it doesn&#39;t.  We&#39;ve always been open to facilitating interactions, but there is no substitute for familiarity.  It&#39;s really no different than how I feel meeting a new person, but I have a little more practice in trying to find common ground.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m not saying you didn&#39;t give it a chance--I&#39;m just asking.  I recently talked with a new homeschooler who complained about every group in her area being cliquish and then it turned out that she only went once to visit each one.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Years ago after a big conference someone wrote to the conference&#39;s  <br/>
discussion list and said her girl(s?) went and that the other girls  <br/>
already seemed to know each other and that it was just like school,  <br/>
that they had cliques.<br/>
<br/>
When I go to a conference, there are people I like and know and I&#39;ll  <br/>
want to find them at some point and visit.  Sometimes if the  <br/>
conference is big and busy, I don&#39;t even make it around to all the  <br/>
people I do know, and there&#39;s no time left to make new friends.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes people need to go to more than one unschooling conference  <br/>
before they make good friends (parents or kids).  Sometimes there&#39;s a  <br/>
&quot;love at first sight&quot; friendship.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike school, though, where teachers try to press kids to include  <br/>
everyone, or where there are artificial playgroups and teams created,  <br/>
the conference was just like the real world, where each person had the  <br/>
freedom to hang out in her room, or to go out and introduce herself,  <br/>
or just to sit and watch.   It was NOT just like school at all.    But  <br/>
that mom hurled her worst insult, which was &quot;like school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think sometimes people expect becoming an unschooler to solve all  <br/>
their problems.  People expect too much of other unschoolers, socially  <br/>
and politically and financially.  All kinds of ways.  They expect us  <br/>
to take care of each other&#39;s emotional needs and sometimes more.  It&#39;s  <br/>
not healthy.<br/>
<br/>
Something related came up in the unschooling chat yesterday, about  <br/>
whether an unschooling commune would be a wonderful thing.  I think  <br/>
not.  I think each unschooling family should exist in the real world,  <br/>
whole and independent.  Having other unschooling friends is awesome;  <br/>
we always have from the beginning, and found more through my speaking  <br/>
at conferences.  Some families organize campouts or get-togethers and  <br/>
meet other families.    But nowhere in there should other families be  <br/>
obligated to provide for a family for no other reason than that  <br/>
they&#39;re also unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1960195059">***Something related came up in the unschooling chat yesterday, about <br/>

not. I think each unschooling family should exist in the real world, <br/>

<br/>
I agree with this assessment.  Our family has lived with other families.  When it&#39;s hard enough for partners to stay together, it&#39;s even harder to make it work within a context of multiple others.  Both times that we lived with other families it worked just fine.  The longest we stayed with another family was a year.  There were problems that arose, things we had to work through, but overall the experience was a good one.  It didn&#39;t destroy any lasting friendships either, but that took a lot of work afterward to keep up with those friendships after a bit of time and space.<br/>
<br/>
My parents also lived communally for a while when I was young.  It was great as a kid, but my parent&#39;s experience was very different from what I experienced.  If anyone has seen the movie, the Anarchists Cookbook, it has a lot of very interesting eye opening thoughts about communal living and the dynamics that happen within a communal setting.  That&#39;s not to say that all communes experience what happens in that story, but from having done a bit of communal living myself, and having talked extensively with my own parents about it, this outcome is more likely than not, albeit, maybe not as extreme.  There have been relatively successful communes over the history of communes.  Theirs was a hippy experience, which in many ways wasn&#39;t the best communal experience, nor really indicative of communal experiences in general.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the basic problem that I have with communes, in relation to unschooling;  Unschooling operates as a family unit where the parents give their children many choices, as many as they can, in order that they&#39;ll be able to grow up knowing themselves better, learning more, and being more solidly able to make good choices for themselves as adults.  All communes operate within a defined parameter that helps the commune work most effectively.  Those parameters narrow the choices that a parent can give their children.  I&#39;ve experienced this even on a smaller level of living with just one other family.  Some of those choices may be a favorable trade off for something better, like a bigger and nicer house and the ability to save money that one can use for their children.  Eventually that trade off may not be so great.<br/>
<br/>
The notion of communes is appealing, I&#39;ll agree wholeheartedly with that!  The actual practice of it, isn&#39;t nearly as great as the idea of it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-497744547">Earlier this year a family that we were close to moved five hours away.  Our boys were very close with all the kids in this big family.  Realizing that suddenly we were faced with a big friend void, I also realized that in our area, our local homeschool group existed soley for fieldtrips. This particular HS group would not exactly meet our needs.  I decided to start our own group just based on friendship and unstructured play.  It couldn&#39;t have worked out better.  Suddenly we found ourselves meeting all sorts of like-minded people that we didn&#39;t even know existed.  We now meet up a couple times a month and its been great for our kids. Its been great for us parents too!  <br/>

&gt;    <br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are levels, though, of communal living. I know someone who has <br/>
lived in communal housing for many many years - all the children&#39;s <br/>
lives. They love it. Unschoolers.  But they have their own space and <br/>
their own jobs. Their own housing is small - but they have a little <br/>
kitchen, a small living room area, a couple of bedrooms. Outside is <br/>
beautiful - the family living spaces are separated form each other by <br/>
gardens with pathways between the housing units. Lots of space in <br/>
between - way more than we have in my suburban neighborhood. Then they <br/>
have the communal areas that are a huge big very wonderfully equipped <br/>
kitchen and dining area and lots of meeting rooms, craft rooms, etc. And <br/>
there are other smaller buildings here and there on the grounds - her <br/>
husband has one as a music studio.<br/>
<br/>
They do have communal meals and they take turns with chores and they <br/>
share a LOT of stuff - there is definitely a very very sharing <br/>
atmosphere - much more than I&#39;m comfortable with, myself (people using <br/>
each others&#39; cars all the time, etc). But they aren&#39;t communal in the <br/>
&quot;we&#39;re all one family&quot; kind of commune that people sometimes think of.<br/>
<br/>
For that kind of living, I do think it would be nice if the other people <br/>
were also unschoolers, to some degree, at least. It is like a <br/>
neighborhood - only a much closer neighborhood than what we usually <br/>
experience.  It reminds me a LOT of the way my husband grew up in a <br/>
small town in Iran - people ate together, worked together, cooked <br/>
together, went down to the river to wash clothes together, picked fruit <br/>
together, went to the bath house together, etc. It worked well because <br/>
they had such a common culture.<br/>
<br/>
My husband&#39;s sister told me she felt very sorry for Americans because we <br/>
live such isolated lifestyles - each separated into our own houses - <br/>
doing our housework alone, cooking alone, eating with just our immediate <br/>
family, not friends and neighbors and extended family, all the time.<br/>

<br/>
This is the biggest appeal to me!  I do think that our culture has grown an unnatural isolation of nuclear families.  I live in a close quarters sort of area.  I talk to almost all of my neighbors, I don&#39;t like all of them, but I at least know them.  <br/>
<br/>
One of the best parts of living with others was the lack of isolation in doing tasks together while the kids played together.  Making food and eating together was also a nice aspect.  We lived in a house with 2 kitchens and there were times when we seperated our families when we needed to.  Eating is intimate, but sometimes families need space.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve wondered sometimes, if the modern commune in our culture is in reaction to our culture&#39;s intense desire for sole ownership by individuals.  Food is an interesting way of relinquishing ownership among individuals.  As a disclaimer, I&#39;m extrapolating from my own experiences. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1278590632">I would never live in communaly but having said that you can definitely create your own community without having to live together.<br/>
I have our homeschool friends and we get together, share recipes, go to movies with each other kids, the moms go to concerts, we go can and cook in each other&#39;s house, share dishes, think about each other a lot.<br/>
So when my friend got a hold of some awesome blueberries she called me and some friends to offer.<br/>
Then she invited us to her house and we all canned together!<br/>
My neighbour ( a quarter mile away as I live out in the country!) works at night and needed to live her son a few times to sleep over, no problem. We have a huge vegetable garden together in my farm and next year one of my homeschool friends wants to join in! This friend is also going to help me paint my family room next Spring!<br/>
Maybe it is because farmers grew up helping each other. If you need something you go to another farmer for help. You share machinery ( I have a combine and you have a hay baler kind of share) and you watch out for each other!<br/>
My husband was raised like that and has friends he grew up with that live very close to us!<br/>
I can see how its is nice to have a community like that. <br/>
Go out meet your neighbours, make friends, help each other out. Go visit that seniro neighbour that lives alone. Share your garden &quot;profits&quot;!  <br/>
It may be harder for some. My mom used  tlk to everyone she met and she made friends ( still does) everywhere she  goes and I became just like her&lt;VBG&gt;!<br/>

Legally speaking we live in a 3 bedroom condo with a larger than ususal &quot;club house&quot;. Unlike a commune we don&#39;t share our income in any way beyond paying condo fees. What makes it different from any other condo association is the desire and intent to be friendly neighbors. We have communal meals about 2 times a week, but they&#39;re entirely optional.<br/>
<br/>
We moved to this community because we wanted our kids to have access to other grown-ups, besides us. My family is entirely in India and my husband&#39;s family is rather small. So my kids don&#39;t have any aunts, uncles or cousins that they see regularly. We felt like we and they would benefit from more community.<br/>
<br/>
Our community was started by a group of friends who&#39;re very active SCA members and wanted to live near each other. That attracted more SCA folks and other folks with interesting hobbies. That has been wonderful for my daughter.<br/>
