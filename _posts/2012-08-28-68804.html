<div id="ygrps-yiv-579559953">This is a quote from a discussion elsewhere, and over  a year ago, so I&#39;m not wantint to discuss that and where it came from, but the idea of it:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What I felt a bit uneasy about was an assumption that there was a &#39;right&#39; way of doing things that could make mothers feel guilty if they hadn&#39;t done it. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to be a participant in a project from a blog called &quot;Do Life Right&quot; (Lisa Cottrell-Bentley&#39;s blog), and I have a similar agitation.<br/>
<br/>
I think there are better and worse ways to unschool.  I think there are ways that aren&#39;t unschooling at all. :-)   But I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s a single right way, except to be mindful and attentive and not full of shit.   But that can&#39;t be carved over the doorway of Unschooling World.  <br/>
<br/>
But the beginning quote, which wasn&#39;t just about unschooling, I don&#39;t think, makes me bristle the other direction.<br/>
<br/>
When people say &quot;there&#39;s no one right way,&quot; it&#39;s true.  But when they say it and hope to have others say, &quot;No, you&#39;re right.  Every single decision any mother made, any action any mother took, any situation any  mother created is just as glorious and awesome as any other, because mothers are never, ever wrong,&quot; then I worry about their children.<br/>
<br/>
I think mothers SHOULD feel guilty if they haven&#39;t done well.  Maybe Well isn&#39;t the same as Right.  But certainly it&#39;s possible for a mother to screw it all up horribly.<br/>
<br/>
Because I have something coming up when I actually need to be as clear as I can be on what doing this right would be, I&#39;d appreciate some discussion.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The words right and wrong are so judgment laden that they are about as<br/>
useful as Good and Bad. In fact, they are just different words for the same<br/>
thing. It&#39;s hard to not use them, however. But in any case, for me it&#39;s<br/>
about ownership of your choices.  It isn&#39;t about what&#39;s right or wrong or<br/>
good or bad.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes what we take to be &quot;bad choices&quot; turn out to be &quot;good choices,&quot;<br/>
so even listening to guilt isn&#39;t all that helpful. You can&#39;t predict the<br/>
future, or control the possibilities and roads that open. All you can do is<br/>
affirm what you have done and move on to the next moment. There is no &quot;right<br/>
way,&quot; there is just YOUR WAY, the one you have chosen, affirmed and<br/>
embraced.<br/>
<br/>
Any discussion that discusses &quot;a way&quot; or &quot;path&quot; is logically flawed. It<br/>
ignores individuals and all the many contexts of life. Life isn&#39;t something<br/>
to be done &quot;right,&quot; it is something to be lived, and loved -with all its<br/>
mistakes and flaws. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1152388784">You just never know what will be that will make damage your child in some way.<br/>
<br/>
I like to tell a story that happen to me as a child.  Many parents would not even<br/>
think about something so small but it was huge for me. <br/>
<br/>
I am glad as a grew up, my mother was pretty amazing in a lot of ways and was supportive most of the time and in other big ways and I  overcame that moment and was able to tell my mom what happened. It was not until I was on my 20&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a little girl, between 8 and 11 ( I do not remember exactly) we used to spend the weekends at my grandfather&#39;s mountain ranch. We loved it very much and it was heaven on earth. <br/>
ON the way there we stopped in a restaurant for lunch or a snack and one time in one of the little shops around it there were some doll clothes on sale and my mom said we could pick one for our dolls.<br/>
My sister picked a very colorful and bright one and I picked one in tan colors, like light fall colors.<br/>
My mom turned to me and said something like:<br/>
&quot;Why don&#39;&#39;t you get something more colorful and happy like your sister&#39;s?<br/>
 That was a blow! I had loved the one I picked and the colors on it but my mom&#39;s idea of children&#39;s stuff was all bright and for her &quot;happy&quot; colors. I had been so excited about them. I did get them but felt I did not have good taste in clothes!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
So my self steam  got hurt. It took me years to pick something for me to dress in. Years. I would let others pick my clothes, or colors or do it but feel I probably picked something ugly.<br/>
My sister was very into fashion so I become a girl that dressed in whatever.<br/>
<br/>
I screw up a lot too. I think we all need to stop and think and be mindful with our children.<br/>
Not a right way , but there are definitely  ways that harm ,even little things like that which may not have been an issue for some kids but it is for others. <br/>
<br/>
I have caught my self almost or starting to say things like that to my kids. I have stopped most times before I started.  But it takes work. <br/>
<br/>
There are some big ways that are wrong and anyone can see that. Verbal abuse or physical abuse comes to mind.<br/>
But there are small things too.<br/>
Principles. The more clear, to yourself,  you are about your principles and making better choices, the better you will know how to respond to a child or a situation.<br/>
<br/>
I am still working on it and still I screw up.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>

I agree.  I think it&#39;s worse to live by rules and scripts than to clarify how and why you are living as you live, and then being flexible while maintaining your integrity.<br/>

<br/>
I disagree with this.<br/>
<br/>
Always Learning is probably the most logical parenting discussion I&#39;ve ever seen and has lasted nearly 11 years now.   There are paths that lead away from unschooling and paths that lead toward it.  There are ways to do it better and ways to torpedo it irreparably.<br/>
<br/>
Just because there&#39;s more than one way doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s an infinite number of ways.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s  more than one way to get to Santa Fe from Albuquerque.  There are four or five ways by road, one much better than any others; there&#39;s light rail; there&#39;s flight (impractical); there&#39;s walking (crazy).   There are thousands of ways to leave Albuquerque and get to places far, far from Santa Fe.<br/>
<br/>
-=-The words right and wrong are so judgment laden that they are about as<br/>
useful as Good and Bad. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Without judgment, there can be no thought, though.  What&#39;s better and worse has to do with one&#39;s perspective.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Sometimes what we take to be &quot;bad choices&quot; turn out to be &quot;good choices,&quot;<br/>
so even listening to guilt isn&#39;t all that helpful. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Salvaging a bad situation while not feeling at all guilty for having caused it?<br/>
<br/>
-=- You can&#39;t predict the<br/>

affirm what you have done and move on to the next moment. There is no &quot;right<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m not going to &quot;affirm&quot; careless rudeness on my part.   &quot;My way&quot; isn&#39;t just to accept everything I stumble into or over as something I chose or should embrace.  Not everything I do is equally good, or chosen.<br/>
<br/>
There are bad parents in the world who are not parenting right by ANYone&#39;s definition.  I don&#39;t want to talk about them, but I also don&#39;t want to be grouped with them.<br/>

<br/>
My thoughts when I read this - <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Look at your kids.  Really look at them and see who *they* are and not who<br/>
you want them to be.  Get to know them.  Be nice to them.  Nicer than nice.<br/>
Be kind to them.  Love them and kiss them and hug them and Be with them.<br/>
Play with them.  Listen to them.  Talk with them, not to them.  Be patient<br/>
and calm.  Love your spouse or partner, if you have one.  Be kind and nice<br/>
and patient with your spouse or partner too.  Love them and hug them and see<br/>
who they really are without trying to make them who you want them to be.<br/>
Remember that you are an important person, and grab moments where you can to<br/>
rest or eat or breathe or pause, so you can keep yourself in a happy place<br/>
when your kids or your spouse/partner are tired or crabby.  Fill your house<br/>
with peace, toys, interesting things, good food, and love.  Create<br/>
abundance, not scarcity, even if you have very little in terms of monetary<br/>
resources.  Love and peace and happiness don&#39;t cost a thing :-)  Say &quot;yes&quot; a<br/>
lot.  Do things and go places and explore the world together with your<br/>
family - whether the world, to you, means your backyard, your neighborhood,<br/>
your town, your state/country, or a giant chunk of the globe.  Share your<br/>
passions or interests with your kids and your partner, and revel in theirs.<br/>
Realize your unschooling life and someone else&#39;s unschooling life won&#39;t look<br/>
exactly just the same, and that&#39;s because your kids and their kids, your<br/>
partner and their partner, your house and their house, your interests and<br/>
their interests. they&#39;re not the same either.  But still read, talk, and<br/>
think about what you are doing, and listen to what others are doing.  Learn<br/>
from the example of people who have been there/done that, and be an example<br/>
for those who will come after you on the unschooling path.  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I think &quot;Doing it Right&quot; looks like :-)<br/>

&gt; for a mother to screw it all up horribly.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is part of what I&#39;m working on for my talk for the December Always Learning Live. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I think the problem is that people don&#39;t realize they don&#39;t have a clear goal or lack an understanding of whether their goal is realistic. People can&#39;t figure out whether they&#39;re doing right -- making the choices that will move them towards their goal -- if they don&#39;t realize the goal they&#39;re headed for is a label that shifts to different places rather whimsically rather than a fixed point.<br/>
<br/>
Most thinking parents want to be good parents. They want to raise their kids right. But what does good mean? What does right mean? For most parents the definition -- without them realizing it -- changes with each decision. Which is why decisions can seem so hard!<br/>
<br/>
It would be like heading for San Francisco but at each cross roads you redefined what city you labeled &quot;San Francisco&quot; without realizing it.<br/>
<br/>
If someone&#39;s goal is to be a good parent, does that mean correcting children when they misbehave, making them happy, instilling good values, encouraging choices that will lead them to being successful, independent people discouraging choices that will lead them away? Those aren&#39;t all compatible! One parent may label all of those &quot;GOOD&quot; -- or put them all in the box they carry around in their head that&#39;s labeled &quot;GOOD&quot; (which ever analogy helps you). But a choice that moves toward one will move away from others.<br/>
<br/>
(In a way we&#39;re all playing with Madlibs without realizing it. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
(As a side idea that&#39;s related but I haven&#39;t yet crystalized, in today&#39;s New York Times there&#39;s an article about Mitt Romney&#39;s publicity people&#39;s work to &quot;humanize&quot; him, part of which focuses on his sons to send the message that he&#39;s a &quot;successful father.&quot; The blurb says: &quot;For a campaign struggling to humanize its candidate, the Romney clan provides a camera-ready tableau for a point his advisers want to underscore: Policies aside, Mitt Romney is a successful father.&quot; Whether or not you agree with any of that, what&#39;s *implied* is that we obviously all agree we have a common definition of &quot;successful father&quot; that Mitt Romney&#39;s sons fit satisfyingly into. If there&#39;s one definition we&#39;re all working towards, and your children aren&#39;t like that, then a parent isn&#39;t being a &quot;good&quot; parent, isn&#39;t doing things &quot;right&quot;.)<br/>
<br/>
If someone&#39;s goal is to be kind, the choices become much clearer. (Though not completely clear because the goal is too narrow, too mechanical. Is it kind to give a child exactly what they want at the expense of someone else? If you can&#39;t be kind to both, is it better to be kinder to the child than an adult who can fend for themselves? (Hint: the unschooling answer is finding a way to meet the need AND be respectful.)<br/>
<br/>
If someone&#39;s goal is to give their child the skills they need to be successful in life ... Well, it sounds wonderfully noble, the makings of a good and selfless parent :-) ... It even sounds doable *if* someone&#39;s understanding is children are empty vessels awaiting filling with the good stuff. But in actual practice it will clash with the reality that children aren&#39;t empty. They are born with inherent preferences and abilities that will draw them towards what will feed their inner needs and help them turn away from what won&#39;t. The more a parent pushes against their preferences rather than working with them, the more damage they&#39;ll cause both to the child and to the relationship.<br/>
<br/>
If someone&#39;s goal is unschooling ... What does that mean? Does it mean following the &quot;unschooling formula&quot;, making the &quot;unschooling choices&quot; -- &quot;Don&#39;t ever ...&quot;, &quot;Always ....&quot;, so your child will turn out &quot;right&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
If, instead, someone sees the unschooling philosophy as a tool that is very useful for helping towards some goals -- but not others -- I think things become clearer.<br/>
<br/>
If someone&#39;s goals are compatible with nurturing who their child is, are compatible with nurturing a child&#39;s ability to live peacefully with others while meeting their own needs, then the results are far more likely to turn out as you expect.<br/>
<br/>
If someone&#39;s goal works against who their child is, works against the child growing an understanding of how to meet their needs AND take others into consideration, the results are likely to be iffy.<br/>
<br/>
What makes it especially confusing is when a parent&#39;s goal, or their approach, works with their child&#39;s personality and it gets the child where the parent wanted them to be. The parent&#39;s &quot;success&quot; can then make them feel like they&#39;ve discovered some universal truth about the right way to raise kids. But they just got lucky ;-) And that&#39;s why the results of trying to be a &quot;good&quot; parent can be so iffy. What works for some families, can be a disaster for other families. And the failed parents can feel like there&#39;s something wrong with them for not being able to make the &quot;right&quot; way work. (What&#39;s &quot;wrong with them&quot; is an educational system and parenting practices that focus on knowing the right answer rather than figuring out what answers can work for what goal you have. So many people spend their childhoods feeling wrong which carries into their adulthood. They end up feeling they need to rely on the people who already have the right answers because they don&#39;t have what it takes to just know.)<br/>
<br/>
When the unschooling philosophy is combined with a compatible goal, the results are far more predictable than any other philosophy or goal because the tools and goals are compatible with human nature rather than dependent on a particular mix of personality. And then the tools support parents in exploring how the ideas can be put into practice in their family so they&#39;re compatible with the child&#39;s personality.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1654585497">This is such a great thread..Until I came to this list, I was part of<br/>
another list that made me feel this way:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If I didn&#39;t do it the right way, then I wasn&#39;t really unschooling&quot;..<br/>
<br/>
I have stopped reading that list after some threads on grandparents were<br/>
responded to in ways that would not include the grandparent&#39;s feelings in<br/>
anyway at all. So initially I was so up-in-arms about unschooling my child<br/>
that I was talking about &quot;me ( and my child)&quot; and &quot;them (my family)&quot;..<br/>
until I learnt here that I can &quot;choose&quot; to be kind to my family and the<br/>
whole team playing goes against the very philosophy of unschooling...<br/>
<br/>
Being a certain way (in my case Radical Unschooling) with my child and<br/>
since I live in a joint (non-nuclear) family, does not make it okay for me<br/>
to not consider the values of people that live with me. What it requires is<br/>
lots of creative thinking (still working on it) to be able make that better<br/>
choice when faced with any situation...<br/>
<br/>
So to me being that better mom translates to also being that better wife<br/>
and daughter-in-law while being that better mom..<br/>
<br/>
That is something I have learnt from this list and I will always be<br/>
grateful for that....<br/>

I don&#39;t agree with that at all.  Children are removed from abusive homes all the time.  I&#39;m certain those parents weren&#39;t doing right for their children.<br/>

Interesting analogy!  If you have a bow and arrow and you are trying to hit the target, then you are probably going to get it right at least part of the time.  If you are spinning in circles and aiming and letting go, you probably won&#39;t ever hit it and when you do, it&#39;s one lucky shot!<br/>

Guilt is a funny thing. It is society in our heads. It isn&#39;t me owning what<br/>
I did, it&#39;s me feeling bad because I&#39;ve been trained to feel bad. Supposedly<br/>
this feeling bad equates into ownership. I&#39;m  not sure that it does. Guilt<br/>
seems like hatred turned inward, a denial of self, a negation of self. <br/>
<br/>
When I said before affirming mishaps, I meant &quot;owning them,&quot; and only<br/>
thereby valuing them.  Valuing them for how they shaped my current self, how<br/>
they taught me, guided me, help me to see things differently, etc. But at<br/>
the end of the day, acknowledging that &quot;I&quot; actually did them. Guilt seems to<br/>
me to be a pushing away of this ownership, it&#39;s like a &quot;oh my, how could &#39;I&#39;<br/>
do something like that.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
In most parenting discussions, guilt is a dominate participant because<br/>
people are always telling others what they should do, as if there is a<br/>
&quot;right way,&quot; making people feel less than because they aren&#39;t living up to<br/>
some more perfect ideal. I&#39;m not sure how any of it is helpful, as most of<br/>
us know that what works for one kid may not work for another. It&#39;s hit and<br/>
miss a lot of the time. It&#39;s also not helpful because my ideal isn&#39;t<br/>
necessarily yours.<br/>
<br/>
The absolute most helpful piece of parenting advice I have ever received was<br/>
from this list. The whole idea of there only being bad moments rather than<br/>
days created such a change in my existence. It didn&#39;t try to make me feel<br/>
guilty for not being a better parent. Instead, it acknowledge that I am<br/>
human, and fallible.  That&#39;s helpful. Another aspect of this was ownership,<br/>
an acknowledgement that I willingly decided to do the things that /I/ am<br/>
doing, on my own chosen path.<br/>

<br/>
I can see how that could be, but I really think guilt is our conscience telling us we&#39;ve done something we shouldn&#39;t have and then feeling bad about it.  Some people take guilt and turn it inward to self hatred and then pass the blame on other people.  I&#39;ve seen that happen plenty of times!  I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a healthy way to process guilt.  It&#39;s much better to acknowledge that you feel badly about something and then DO something about it that makes things better, not worse.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 ***I also assumed that the discussion was only about those trying to find &quot;the right way.&quot;***<br/>
<br/>
Yes and no.  There are people who put on good shows for others, especially online, like dressing up for a club party where you don&#39;t have to actually expose who you are for real.  The unschooling ideas might very well appeal to that person and they may very well try to do things &quot;the right way&quot;, but get it wrong over and over without any kind of self reflection that causes a change for the better.<br/>
<br/>
There are adults who are too defensive, too reactionary, to really do any kind of internal change to make unschooling work well.  I don&#39;t think they are doing it right.  That&#39;s my judgment.  If guilt can help that person do better, then I&#39;m all for a person feeling it.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m watching &quot;Idiocracy.&quot;  It&#39;s a movie that seems entirely worthless, but turns out to be profound. :-)     People came to believe that Brawndo was what plants craved, because it had electrolytes.  For 200 years people believed that, and all the plants died.  People spoke in phrases they didn&#39;t understand.  They said &quot;Brawndo has what plants crave.  It has electrolytes.&quot;  When asked what electrolytes were, they said &quot;Electrolytes are what plants crave.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It turned out plants needed water.<br/>
<br/>
Some plants grow better in the desert than in the jungle and vice versa, but plants are different in the way different animals are different.    Some plants grow under water.  Some grow up in trees--mistletoe, and moss.<br/>
<br/>
People are all human and learn the same way, but wondering and figuring things out, and making connections.   <br/>
<br/>
Birds, worms, lions and catfish don&#39;t all learn the same way people do.  Your plant analogy would turn to &quot;If we value nature and listening, and the growth of all animals, then there isn&#39;t THE  &#39;right way,&#39; there can be many, and should be many. To deny multiple ways, we may deny some animals the conditions of their growth.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There are many ways different animals grow and live.  Some live in the water and some live in trees.   Polar bears and lions can&#39;t change places and thrive.<br/>
<br/>
There are ways of being that are bad for people, and things that help them.<br/>

I very  much disagree with this.  Regret isn&#39;t based on training.  If by &quot;training&quot; you mean principles, courtesy, interpersonal skills, logic...  then what about people learning those things on their own, seeing their value, and trying to be the best people they can be?

It&#39;s a tool.  <br/>
The way you use the tool, and the way you feel about your decisions, is part of your own learning.  It it has helped you to live in moments, that&#39;s great.  But &quot;it&quot; didn&#39;t perceive you.<br/>
<br/>
And part of the point of not declaring a whole day to be &quot;a bad day&quot; is because IF things aren&#39;t going well, the mother can say &quot;That was a bad moment, and I can do better right now.&quot;  Sometimes guilt is what might alert her to do better.  Or regret, or remorse.  No one was recommending that moments should be randomly &quot;owned&quot; without judgment or intention to do well and to be thoughtful and careful in the way we interact with our children and others.<br/>

seems like hatred turned inward, a denial of self, a negation of self. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I disagree. When I feel guilty for a choice I made towards my children it has nothing to do with society in my head. <br/>
When I chose to hit my son  because I got aggravated I did not feel bad because society in my head tells me not to hit my child. The contrary<br/>
most would think that was the right thing to do. I feel guilty because that is not the way I want to be towards him, because I do not believe in spanking,<br/>
because I was did not make the &quot;right choice&quot;  and the choice to hit him goes against my principles, values and everything I think will be good parenting.<br/>
It is very important to have goals and judge what are good choices or bad choices that you make having those principles in mind. <br/>
If one is  not sure, or have not put much thoughts to it than one  will not be able to decide what choices goes against his principles and the relationship you <br/>
want to create in your family.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;When I said before affirming mishaps, I meant &quot;owning them,&quot; and only<br/>

me to be a pushing away of this ownership, it&#39;s like a &quot;oh my, how could &#39;I&#39;<br/>
do something like that.&quot; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When I make a bad choice , I feel guilty, I also think about what are better choices I could have made and why. I decide that moment not<br/>
to repeat them.   I do not stop and feel sorry for my self .  I work on it. I think . I apologize if possible. I redo and do over , or re-word .<br/>
I think and decide right there to do better next time.<br/>
Once Schuyler Waynforth told me to just decide that moment to never hit my son again. That simple. And I did.  I made a choice and decided to never do it again. <br/>
Not that I had decided to hit him before. I have never wanted to, but I did more than once as a reaction. <br/>
My decision was to not react that way again. To walk away and take a deep breath if I felt like doing it. |To chose a better reaction.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;In most parenting discussions, guilt is a dominate participant because<br/>

necessarily yours.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
SOme people say that spanking works for their kids. I could care less if those parents who choose to spank  feel guilty.<br/>
They should feel guilty.<br/>
I have hit my son. I felt super guilty. I would be horrified if I did not.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The way unschooling happens in my home will be different than my friend in NYC.<br/>
SHe will be close to a big city with all its opportuniti , I live in a Dairy Farm.  Just that makes our lives with our kids very different.<br/>
But we have the same goals  in how we want to live with our kids, what kind of relationship we want to develop with them.<br/>
We both want to create a wonderful learning environment. We may have similar values and principles but our days <br/>
look very different. Different kids, different likes and dislikes, different personalities, different homes, city, friends...<br/>
IF I made my kids be what they are not, if I made my kids eat what I thought was healthy,, and only do things I valued them that would not be a right way to radically unschool. I could still say I was an unschooler but I would be full of BS!<br/>

Acting and reacting without conscious thought is a problem no matter what the results are, *IF* the goal is to live a mindful, thoughtful life and to set an example for one&#39;s child(ren) of  making good choices.<br/>
<br/>
Probably the main topic of my &quot;doing unschooling right&quot; video will be about making choices.   <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that all choices will be the same, it&#39;s that any life lived in a kneejerk, thoughtless way is going to be doomed to a low level of joy and awareness.  <br/>
<br/>
I have lived a life of conscience.  If I only allowed myself to feel supportive and proud of everything I did, whether by choice or random hit-or-miss chance, that would not be living by conscience.  It would be painting over mistakes with a brush of &quot;acceptance&quot; and justifying carelessness.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s nothing right about that.<br/>

<br/>
Simpler, more helpful for anyone, is becoming clear where you want to go, who you want to be. <br/>
<br/>
Then, before reacting, give yourself two choices. Make the choice that&#39;s better at moving you towards where you want to go, who you want to be.<br/>

How someone does that, depending on their baggage, may look different from person to person. But the essence will be the same.<br/>

If you think of guilt-tripping others as an artifact -- it may even be a biological tendency we all have -- an artifact that helped people work together better which increased the security and safety of everyone in the group maybe it will help you let it slide off of you when people try to do that.<br/>
<br/>
I think this list isn&#39;t a good fit for people who beat themselves up over past choices. This list is chock full of &quot;do this instead&quot; advice, not to make all people act the same, but to create a body of information focused on a very specific way of doing things.<br/>

with my choice, and sometimes I&#39;ll feel regret or remorse. Neither should be<br/>
a permanent state, because there are more decisions to make all the time.<br/>
Learning from mistakes is a big part of natural learning you seem to want to<br/>
dispose of.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am not trying to dispose of it, all I am saying is that talk of guilt<br/>
isn&#39;t helpful.  Your original email  said mother&#39;s that screw it up should<br/>
feel very badly.   I think there is enough guilt in parenting discussions. I<br/>
do not find it helpful. It just makes people feel bad. It doesn&#39;t give them<br/>
tools. <br/>
<br/>
 Pains of consciousness are important and necessary in many ways in striving<br/>
towards reaching your principles, but it seems like parenting talks revert<br/>
to making people feel bad about how badly they parent, about their bad<br/>
choices, their bad whatever. I don&#39;t find any of it helpful. <br/>
<br/>
Sandra:<br/>
I don&#39;t live my life in a &quot;hit and miss&quot; way. (The phrase is &quot;hit or miss,&quot;<br/>
and that&#39;s not a goal to strive for, either.)<br/>
<br/>
By hit or miss I don&#39;t mean not making conscious choices based on<br/>
principles, I mean that we cannot always control what happens. We can strive<br/>
and reach and aim, but misfires happen.  When they do, having easy tools to<br/>
get back on track is helpful. Sitting around feeling badly isn&#39;t. <br/>

<br/>
It helps to let go of there being a right answer and instead focus on solution*s* that are better for the goal you want and solutions that aren&#39;t as good.<br/>
<br/>
Making choices, making even better choices, means you&#39;ll be making choices that don&#39;t turn out as expected. You&#39;ll make choices that have both upsides and downsides mixed together. It&#39;s part of the learning process. You look at what happened, figure out why, and use that information so you choice can be better next time. <br/>
<br/>
That &quot;right answer&quot;, though, is separate from what Sandra&#39;s talking about. There *are* some universal rights and wrongs in how we treat people. Being kind *is* better than being unkind. People make collections of what they believe are rights and wrongs and call them a philosophy. :-) There can be right and wrong choices, better and not as good choices, if someone&#39;s wish is to follow the philosophy.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree with this. It&#39;s a good bellwether for me, too. If, in a decision-making moment with my kids, my inner dialog goes all defensive and reactionary, I&#39;m probably not about to move in the right direction.<br/>
<br/>
To me, it feels right when I&#39;m taking action that expand their worlds, nourish and grow their relationships, and help them get their needs met in healthy ways.<br/>
<br/>
It feels wrong when I restrict their world, stymie their relationships, and don&#39;t prioritize their needs. Sometimes, that happens for reasons I can&#39;t control. Those are maybe like side-steps. I try to get quickly back on the path.<br/>
<br/>
But even if I screw up and choose wrong or do wrong unthinkingly, I can move back in the right direction by not getting defensive, reactionary, or mired in self-loathing but rather fixing what pieces I can and taking some concrete lesson for myself to apply next time. <br/>
<br/>
I think choosing to evolve as a parent and partner is a huge part of doing unschooling right. Or maybe it&#39;s less like evolution and more like tuning an instrument or a machine, making a series of small adjustments that over time help the parent to develop a habit of acting and responding that helps learning and relationships to be enjoyable and smooth. <br/>

The only way to continually evaluate is if you have some sort of direction <br/>

when I forget an important piece of information and say or do something that <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One of the really interesting things that have happened to me since I have <br/>
become more thoughtful and more mindful is that I don’t really have people <br/>
telling me what to do any more. At one time, my mother in law and I did not <br/>
get along. I felt like she was telling me what to do and it was very much <br/>
what is being described here. As I started trying to see things from other <br/>
people’s perspectives, I became more understanding and more compassionate. I <br/>
also became more confident in myself. I spent an hour and a half on the <br/>
phone with my mother in law yesterday and she didn’t once tell me what to do <br/>
nor did she question my parenting. Actually, she was very encouraging and <br/>
complementary to me and our girls. That is a very different picture than the <br/>
way things were five years ago. Five years ago, we were in a power struggle <br/>
over being right. When I let go of that and started really trying to see <br/>
things from her perspective, I changed and so did our relationship. A lot of <br/>
times, people are saying things based on what they observe. If somebody <br/>
observes a family where the children are jerks and the mom is tired and <br/>
frazzled, then that seems like a situation where other people are going to <br/>
see an opportunity to “educate” you. When my oldest was a toddler, I had <br/>
somebody sit me down and give me a “lesson” on child discipline. I smiled <br/>
and nodded and then went on my way. I pretty much ignored it because I knew <br/>
that her goal and my goal were very, very different. If I hadn’t known that <br/>
we wanted very different things for our children, I might have been tempted <br/>
to feel bad.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The idea of things being hit and miss seems like an excuse to do things <br/>
willy nilly. I think I understand what you are saying but it can lead to <br/>
lots of confusion. I do think there is a right way and that right way <br/>
focuses on the process rather than a single product. I have been reading, <br/>
thinking, and writing about making ethical decisions and I think it is a <br/>
good model to follow because it focuses on the process rather than the <br/>
outcome. The process of making an ethical decision has a built in evaluation <br/>
mechanism so that you can think, evaluate, and adjust if a decision turns <br/>
out to be bad or have unintended consequences. Even if your ideal isn’t the <br/>
same as mine, there are some things that I think are universal. Here is a <br/>
link to one source that has a little bit of information about making ethical <br/>
decisions: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.scu.edu/ethics/practicing/decision/making.pdf">http://www.scu.edu/ethics/practicing/decision/making.pdf</a><br/>

Sometimes, parents feel bad and miss the fact that others are trying to help <br/>
give them tools. I have been a part of several discussions where I have <br/>
tried to help other parents evaluate the situation and develop tools to <br/>
address whatever it was that was brought up. The parent is so defensive that <br/>
everything that is said is taken personally and all attempts at helping them <br/>
find or develop tools are completely missed. I don’t think you can have it <br/>
both ways. I don’t know how you can give a person tools without pointing out <br/>
the problem with the current tools (or lack thereof). That is one of the <br/>
things that I have had had a difficult time navigating. I want to be <br/>
thoughtful and mindful towards ALL people but there are times when sharing <br/>
potentially helpful information will lead to a shit storm. Sometimes people <br/>
need to use the feelings of guilt as an impetus to do better rather than <br/>
wallowing in it to get attention and pity. (My mom has a tendency to have <br/>
disasters and feel bad about stuff as a way to get attention and pats on the <br/>
back. She doesn’t really have a desire to do better. She just wants people <br/>
to pat her on the back and tell her how awesome she is.)<br/>

I think one of the things that is missed is the fact that different people <br/>
have different parenting goals. To use Sandra’s example of going on a trip, <br/>
it is like telling each other where to turn without verifying the <br/>
destination. If two people are going to Albuquerque, then sharing ideas on <br/>
how to get there might be worthwhile. If one person is going to Albuquerque <br/>
and the other is going to New York, it wouldn’t be very helpful to discuss <br/>
the specifics such as where to turn and what streets to use. There might be <br/>
some things in common such as how to calculate gas mileage but the <br/>
individual streets to be traveled will be very different. If you are having <br/>
a discussion without knowing that the two of you have very different <br/>
destinations, then there will be times that nothing makes sense. It will be <br/>
like trying to have a conversation in two different languages. If I know <br/>
that somebody has a very different destination than me, I don’t feel guilty <br/>
for being different. If something Sandra or Meredith or Joyce or Brie, etc. <br/>
says makes me feel guilty, then I am going to think long and hard about why <br/>
what they said made me feel that way and I am damn sure going to try to do <br/>
better. One of the things that I don’t think has been mentioned yet in this <br/>
thread is checks and balances. I sometimes feel like moms want to do <br/>
whatever they want without ever feeling bad and without every having their <br/>
parenting checked. I use feelings of guilt to check myself. I also make sure <br/>
that our house is one where my husband and children can and will say <br/>
something if I get too far afield. Even my mom will sometimes say something <br/>
if she notices me being particularly crabby. I don’t see that as them trying <br/>
to make me feel bad about my choices. I see it as them trying to help me and <br/>
keep me on track. It is a system of checks and balances that keeps me from <br/>
becoming the sole voice in the family. I do not want to be the one that <br/>
makes all of the decisions and tells everybody else what to do and how to do <br/>
it.<br/>

were strong enough to use as an anchor to wench the vehicle out. If he didn’t <br/>
have his chains and such with him then we would look for other solutions. <br/>
Sometimes we came up with some crazy ideas. I remember offering ideas and <br/>
having my dad say, “Hmmm, that might work, let’s give it a try.” If it <br/>

which idea or combination of ideas would lead to a solution. It was trial <br/>
and error but the trial and error still followed the laws of physics and <br/>
other universals. We weren’t looking for solutions that defied gravity or <br/>
anything else. We also didn’t expect to be able to get in the vehicle and <br/>
step on the gas and get out. At a certain point, we knew it was time to get <br/>

thing simply led to a deeper hole that was even more difficult to get out <br/>

I think this is true when you are talking about morals but not with actions. There are some actions that are just plain wrong, like purposely harming another person. The only time I can think of when they would not be wrong would be when it&#39;s done in defense of yourself or another.<br/>
<br/>
Spanking is wrong whether it&#39;s a &quot;light&quot; swat on the bottom or a smack in the face. It is still physical violence perpetuated to control and that is wrong.

morals and ethics. There are so many things in your statement above that <br/>
lead to confusion and questions. It would venture into meta-discussions. For <br/>
example, what do you mean by harm? Some people do things that are harmful <br/>
because they see harming as good. If a person follows a completely different <br/>
moral code than you, there probably isn’t much point in having a discussion <br/>
unless terms and ideas are defined at the outset. You have given spanking as <br/>
an example of something that is wrong no matter what. I would hope that most <br/>
people that practice unschooling either don’t spank or are trying to stop <br/>
spanking. For those that follow a different set of standards, not spanking <br/>
is seen as harmful and it doesn’t matter if it is physical violence. The end <br/>
justifies the mean.<br/>
I found this really cool article about chiropractic ethics (it’s a bit weird <br/>
that I stumbled upon it considering that my husband teaches ethics at a <br/>
chiropractic college). Here is the link: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dynamicchiropractic.com/mpacms/dc/article.php?id=46121">http://www.dynamicchiropractic.com/mpacms/dc/article.php?id=46121</a><br/>
It mentions a lot of the things that have been discussed here. I have copied <br/>
and pasted most of the article:<br/>
Ethics comes from the Greek word ethos - moral character or custom. Morality <br/>
comes from the Latin word moralis - custom or manner. The words both deal <br/>
with the customs or the manner in which people do things. Their modern <br/>
meanings relate to the way people act - either good or bad.<br/>
<br/>
Morality, strictly speaking, is used to refer to what we would call moral <br/>
conduct or standards. Morality is looking at how good or bad our conduct is, <br/>
and our standards about conduct. Ethics is used to refer to the formal study <br/>
of those standards or conduct. Sometimes, one refers to the study of conduct <br/>
as moral philosophy, but that is less common than just saying &quot;ethics.&quot; <br/>
Hence, in most chiropractic colleges, there is an ethics class, rather than <br/>
one named &quot;morality.&quot; One might say that morality is ethics in action, but <br/>
in the end, the two terms can be used interchangeably. The study of ethics <br/>
or moral philosophy can be divided into three broad areas: descriptive, <br/>
normative and analytical (or metaethics).<br/>
<br/>
Descriptive ethics is simply describing how people behave. For example, <br/>
people might say that they think that stealing is bad, but descriptive <br/>
ethics might tell us, from observing these people, that they may have <br/>
&quot;downloaded&quot; hundreds of media (in such forms as .mp3 audio or .bmp image) <br/>
files from file-sharing programs on the Internet. Descriptive ethics let us <br/>
see if we &quot;walk the walk,&quot; and if we are just rationalizing our way past our <br/>
own moral beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it takes an unbiased observer to point out to us where we are not <br/>
meeting our own standards. For some, discovering the hypocrisy might just <br/>
get us to change what we say is good or bad, and adopt and lessen our <br/>
professed moral code to fit our actions. Hopefully, descriptive ethics can <br/>
lead to some moral self-reflection and an improvement in our own behavior.<br/>
<br/>
Normative ethics tries to establish norms or typical appropriate behaviors <br/>
people should perform. In ethics class, I call these the &quot;shoulda,&#39; gotta,&#39; <br/>
needa,&#39; hafta&#39; do&quot; things. One should be honest; in the language of ethics, <br/>
this is called &quot;veracity.&quot; We know that as health care providers, we should <br/>
strive to help our patients; this is called beneficence. &quot;Above all, do no <br/>
harm&quot; (or, as Hippocrates wrote: &quot;primum non nocere&quot;) is called <br/>
&quot;nonmaleficence&quot; in ethics (not &quot;nonmalfeasance&quot;). Fairness, or justice, is <br/>
another norm. Gratitude and reparations are often mentioned.<br/>
<br/>
Metaethics often looks at how people determine for themselves what norms to <br/>
follow. I think all parents would agree with me that they have a significant <br/>
impact on what their children grow up to believe are right and wrong <br/>
actions. There are many other sources of people&#39;s personal ethical beliefs. <br/>
Generally, we learn good behaviors from our teachers and our religions. In <br/>
fact, despite all the strife due to religions, the commonality is that they <br/>
teach norms. The Ten Commandments, for example, is basically a list of <br/>
norms. For better, or often, for worse, our ethics are also influenced by <br/>
our peers, and our culture, as seen through the media. Lastly, we have the <br/>
ability to make changes though moral self-reflection.<br/>
<br/>
What roles do guilt and fear play in ethics? They are the two great <br/>
guardians of the &quot;straight and narrow.&quot; Some maintain their conduct within <br/>
accepted ethical norms because of the fear of getting caught. These people <br/>
often do whatever they think that they can &quot;get away with.&quot; If they know <br/>
they are not being watched and are unlikely to get caught, they will violate <br/>
almost any ethical norm. Of course, if they are a bit paranoid or &quot;chicken,&quot; <br/>
they will not stray, as they are not prepared to follow the criminal&#39;s <br/>
dictum: &quot;Don&#39;t do the crime if you can&#39;t do the time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Guilt, on the other hand, is the motivator of honest people. Their decision <br/>
to comply with ethical norms is not based on whether they will get caught, <br/>
but because they will know that they did something they think is wrong. <br/>
Sociopaths do not feel guilt because they do not believe their actions are <br/>
wrong. Ultimately, those who feel guilt as children decide to be &quot;good&quot; <br/>
because they don&#39;t want to feel guilty again. As they get older, being good <br/>
becomes a habit.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(I am putting this out there because looking at things from a more <br/>
philosophical perspective really helped me in my journey to becoming a more <br/>
thoughtful person. For some, it might be too complicated. For me, it is <br/>
precisely what I needed to see the bigger picture. The type of decision <br/>
making that is being discussed in relation to radical unschooling has been <br/>
around for centuries.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t even think it is true when talking about morals - I guess because I<br/>
don&#39;t see the difference between talking about morals and actions. Actions<br/>
spring from morals.<br/>
<br/>
I think, for example, driving when drunk is bad and wrong and I don&#39;t think<br/>
it is unreasonably judgmental of me to say so. I was hit by a drunk driver<br/>
and I don&#39;t think it was just &#39;HIS WAY.&quot; His morals sucked and that&#39;s why<br/>
his actions sucked, too.<br/>
