There&#39;s an illustration and some more history, and a good joke about  <br/>
how boys eat s&#39;mores.<br/>

That has a photo of marshmallow (which maybe totally common in  <br/>
Australia—sorry I don&#39;t know more marshmallow geography, but they  <br/>
didn&#39;t teach it in school; they didn&#39;t even tell us about Vegamite)  <br/>
and some history of S&#39;mores.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Our park day group moves from the park to the beach for summer; <br/>
campfires and s&#39;mores are often part of the fun.  The last couple of <br/>
years, one of our dads started making marshmallow blow guns, so the <br/>
joke about boys eating smores takes on a new twist -- they eat the <br/>
chocolate, shoot the marshmallows at each other, and toss the graham <br/>
crackers to the gulls.<br/>

You should put it on a webpage if you have one.  Or if you don&#39;t, I&#39;d  <br/>
like to (you took &#39;em, you&#39;d have to say okay).<br/>
