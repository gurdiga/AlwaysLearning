<div id="ygrps-yiv-1597964545">I&#39;m off to the in-laws&#39; in Alamogordo.  I figure this might could be the last <br/>
family-trip with all three kids, both parents and no extras.  Kirby&#39;s 16 and <br/>
I never had a whole-family trip at that age.  Even at my high school <br/>
graduation, my sister didn&#39;t attend.    So here we go!  Wish us luck.  <br/>
Holly&#39;s the only one really looking forward to being at her grandmother&#39;s <br/>
house.  But the road trip has the potential to be good, and we&#39;re only <br/>
staying one night.<br/>
<br/>
Oh ye of the British Empire, have a good ordinary day.  You are spared a <br/>
ritual stress-fest (except Canadians, who have their own separate <br/>
stress-fest).<br/>

and the remains of 22 pound turkey are in the fridge, the kitchen is clean,<br/>
and everyone is sleepy looking and happy. A good day for all (except the<br/>
turkey).<br/>
