This kind of thing naturally turns me off, as I feel<br/>
it&#39;s pushing outside motivation and bribes onto kids<br/>
for doing something that they should be doing only<br/>
because they enjoy it.  I can&#39;t help thinking it will<br/>
damage their internal motivation, and their already<br/>
great love of books and stories. **<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like this kind of program either.  If I had to sign up for a program, I think I&#39;d prefer to reverse it and eat a lot of pizza to get a free book. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
According to some research presented in the book Punished by Rewards, kids who perform a task in expectation of a reward enjoy the task less and learn less from their experiences.  (I think the original study was done with kids painting.)<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I believe that when doing animal conditioning for a reward the whole thing only works if the animals are underfed.  As we know, bribing kids with candy and Nintendo time only works when those items are kept in pretty short supply.<br/>

PS  Logging their reading without commenting to them and surprising them with the treat would work for me.</div>
