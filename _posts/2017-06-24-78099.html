<div id="ygrps-yiv-223965719">&quot;I have read, researched and even completed my Master&#39;s thesis on homeschooling. However, I want you to know that in all of that meta analysis, in all of the reading and educational research, nothing has proven to be more valuable to me than what I have learned from reading your list, AlwaysLearning.”<br/>
<br/>
There have been places online I have loved.  The AOL forum when we got a special area for unschooling.  Unschooling.com (long defunct) which Home Education Magazine (now defunct) set up.  <br/>
<br/>
But Always Learning has been the best. And nowadays, people are using facebook more than e-mail.  I understand it.  I do miss the days when this forum was busier. <br/>
<br/>
Today I was reading some in a thank-you book that Heather Booth organized for me, for one of  a Always Learning Live symposium (a defunct series of gatherings). :-)  Her husband, Monty, formatted it, and because I wanted to keep it where my kids could read it someday, it’s hidden (not “hidden,” but…) on my site:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/feedback/Thank_You_Sandra.pdf">http://sandradodd.com/feedback/Thank_You_Sandra.pdf</a><br/>
Safari wouldn’t open it, but Google Chrome did.  <br/>
<br/>
The mom who wrote the very-sweet quote above is stealth in the group, so I would rather not name her, but it made me feel good this morning, again, and I appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>
Always Learning is nearly 16 years old.  That’s older than most people’s children. :-) <br/>
But there are people still here whose unschooled children are grown now, and that’s valuable.<br/>
<br/>
The first post, in Novermber 2001, was by Deb Lewis.  That’s a treasure.<br/>
<br/>
We used to have hundreds of posts a month here.  Now…dozens, usually.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, all, for reading and contributing (if you did either or both).  <br/>
I’m still here. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Here’s what I wrote last fall about being tired.<br/>

OH! I went and read that!<br/>
<br/>
UPDATE:<br/>
<br/>
(Nearly) sixteen years later Dylan is twenty five. His interest in religion <br/>
as it pertained to his own beliefs lasted only a couple of months. Maybe <br/>
that&#39;s no surprise with an atheist mother and an noncommittal dad. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We have Jewish, Christian, vague-ish Christian, Cult-ish-who knows what, <br/>
Baptist, New Age (I&#39;m old, maybe there&#39;s a new word?) Catholic  family, and <br/>
extended family members. We have wiccan, Muslim, Jewish, Catholic, <br/>
Christian,  New-agey friends. Dylan is an atheist.<br/>
<br/>
I wrote then that I didn&#39;t want to tell him what to believe, but if I was <br/>
writing today... I&#39;d tell him what to believe. &lt;g&gt; I suspect it wouldn&#39;t <br/>
have made much difference to the way it turned out.<br/>
<br/>
Dylan was always unschooled. He&#39;s pretty nice. He&#39;s smart. He can read, and <br/>
keep track of his money.  He has a keen interest in economics. I find myself <br/>
staying up late at night reading about Keynesian economics, and other things <br/>
I barely understand, just so I won&#39;t feel as stupid as I really am while <br/>
conversing with him. (It hasn&#39;t helped much) He has a job, speaks two <br/>
languages, plays piano, drives an old Jeep CJ 5, likes to travel. He loves <br/>
music, movies, art, animals, irony, decency and peace. He&#39;s kind, and once <br/>
shut down his job site to rescue a spider.  He&#39;s vegan, liberal, hopeful, <br/>
funny, and sometimes grumpy. His boss trusts, and likes him. Dogs take <br/>
advantage of him. He knows every Godzilla movie ever made.<br/>
<br/>
The AlwaysLearning list was essential to my wellbeing and peace of mind when <br/>
my son was little. I live in a small town, in a rural area of a western, <br/>
primarily agricultural state. I was (or felt) alone here in my philosophy, <br/>
and beliefs about children, and AlwaysLearning gave me hope that the wider <br/>
world included many moms like me, with oddball children who would probably <br/>
turn out ok. It worked! Ta-da!  Dylan had recently lost both his <br/>
grandfathers when Sandra started AlwaysLearning, and we had cared for each <br/>
of them during their final illness. AlwaysLearning helped me put the world <br/>
in perspective. It&#39;s easy to think you&#39;re the only one with X problem, if <br/>
you don&#39;t listen to the wider world.  AlwaysLearning helped me stop and <br/>
listen. &quot;Read a little, try a little, wait a while, watch.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have loved the discussion. I&#39;m old, and tired, but, thank you Sandra, and <br/>
everyone who came to your party, for such a good, thoughtful, funny, <br/>
worthwhile time! You&#39;ve made my life a better life, a more joyful life. I&#39;m <br/>
so grateful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1623049909"><p dir="ltr">How wonderful to see this &quot;update &quot;. Much of what wad ssid in the final paragraphs is applicable to how I felt discovering cybercommunities and making online friends. ...about way more than childraising and unschooling. I was soooo isolated and the web provided such a larger :pool&quot; to find compatible fish like me. Or to gain insight into some not like me.</p>
