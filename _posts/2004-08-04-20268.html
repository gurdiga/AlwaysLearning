<div id="ygrps-yiv-1017308007">Yep - living and learning!  Sharing my favorite childhood books with <br/>
my daughters and reading lots of new &quot;kid books&quot; that weren&#39;t around <br/>
when I was younger.  I am enjoying reading my dd&#39;s books more <br/>
than &quot;adult fiction&quot; lately.  And now I am reading some more <br/>
historical nonfiction books that I would have thought were totally <br/>
boring when I was in school.  History in school was so boring!  I am <br/>
reading a book on the history of eugenics that is a real eye-<br/>
opener.  I don&#39;t remember learning about that in school, and it&#39;s <br/>
pretty scary.  Maybe they don&#39;t call 20% of the population &quot;feeble-<br/>
minded&quot; anymore and attempt to stop them from reproducing, but I <br/>
think that the so-called science of psychology and the drugging of <br/>
large numbers of children is along the same lines - we are the <br/>
experts and we know what&#39;s best for you.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, got off on a tangent there.  I think my dh was smarter.  When <br/>
he was in college and realized that he had no idea why he was there, <br/>
he quit going.<br/>
