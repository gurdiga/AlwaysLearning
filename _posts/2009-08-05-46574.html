<div id="ygrps-yiv-1734019190">This is from some directions for Non-Violent Communication on a site I  <br/>
was looking at here, connected with a school.  The school looks good  <br/>
except for this.   It&#39;s a John-Holt philosophy place, with the overlay  <br/>
of NVC.<br/>
<br/>
---------------------------------------------<br/>
Example:<br/>
Child: crying:&quot;I lost my toy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
	• A possible adult response &quot;I think that you are feeling very sad.&quot;<br/>
	• B possible wrong response: &quot;I wouldn&#39;t worry too much, I am sure it  <br/>
will turn up, it&#39;s here somewhere.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Response A is great! It is simple, it is a restatement of what has  <br/>
been expressed.<br/>
<br/>
Response B on the other hand...not so good.. This is YOUR experience  <br/>
of the lost toy...(We ALL do this) but it is not the child&#39;s  <br/>
experience (nor would it be your experience if you lost your keys or  <br/>
mobile!!).<br/>
---------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
If I lost my keys or my phone, and I said to any of you, or to my  <br/>
husband, or to my children, &quot;I lost my keys!&quot; and if any of you or my  <br/>
husband or children said &quot;I think that you are feeling very said,&quot; I  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be sad at all.  I would be somewhere in the range of  <br/>
offended, irritated or furious.  I expressed an honest need and got  <br/>
&quot;reflection.&quot;  I could look in a mirror for reflection.<br/>
<br/>
To use that sort of reflective communication with babies, with  <br/>
toddlers, makes some sense.  To use it with anyone over the age of  <br/>
three seems to be...  James Daniel, my host, called it &quot;paint by  <br/>
numbers communication.&quot;   And even if you do that well, you still come  <br/>
up with a very rudimentary image based on someone else&#39;s art.<br/>
<br/>
So if someone writes a script and says &quot;This is communication,&quot; that  <br/>
someone is mistaken about communication.  That is being in a very lame  <br/>
play.   I don&#39;t have time to be in a play.<br/>
<br/>
So I was wondering if possibly the more recent noise of &quot;authentic  <br/>
communication&quot; and &quot;being authentic&quot; is a reaction to the scripts  <br/>
recommended by &quot;NVC.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But back to the &quot;possible responses,&quot; I would probably pick the child  <br/>
up and comfort him and ask him what he thought we should do, or if he  <br/>
wanted me to help look for the toy.<br/>
<br/>
If someone has never stopped speaking as one human to another, and has  <br/>
adopted principles involving respect and choices and partnership with  <br/>
a child (or husband, or friend or whatever), then if they never needed  <br/>
the crutch of something like NVC, then they probably don&#39;t need the  <br/>
remedial stage of moving from a script to being &quot;authentic.&quot;     <br/>
Sheesh.  It&#39;s a bandaid on top of a bigger bandage.<br/>
<br/>
How about looking at healthy relationships and actually just  <br/>
communicating?<br/>

***So I was wondering if possibly the more recent noise of &quot;authentic <br/>

<br/>
A couple different times I&#39;ve seen &quot;being authentic&quot; used as an excuse when a parent didn&#39;t want to help a kid with something.<br/>
If the mom was going to be authentic then she wasn&#39;t going to sit and play chess with her kid if she didn&#39;t want to.   That&#39;s part of some self improvement thought, I guess. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen it used when a mom required something of her kid.    To be her authentic self she needs to make him do some math every day.  <br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;ve seen it used in a different way when a mom didn&#39;t want to be bothered about her kid.   A child crying over a lost toy is feeling his authentic feelings which is part of healthy self understanding.  <br/>
Her authentic self is maybe too self focused to realize that helping him find the toy, or getting him another, will help him feel the authentic feelings of happiness and trust.  <br/>
<br/>
I wondered a few years ago if &quot;being authentic&quot; came from the people who were disappointed in or disillusioned by all the power of positive thinking stuff.   Positive thinking didn&#39;t work to solve their problems or make them happy and somehow they became convinced that thinking positively was a ploy of society to make people conform.   Being authentic means you&#39;re special, you are real. <br/>
<br/>
And about NVC stuff - I suspect if normal communication seems violent or threatening to some people they&#39;re suffering from emotional instability.  <br/>

Ditto!  This immediately pushed my buttons and I&#39;m not even the kid who&#39;s lost the toy.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Sandra and Deb for putting it so plainly.  I&#39;ve always felt uncomfortable with this type of response, but was never quite able to rectify what it was that was making me cringe.<br/>

<br/>
Dana, it must just be that you and Deb and I are violent and  <br/>
inauthentic.  Bummer, huh?<br/>
<br/>
I do things like as kids if they&#39;re okay rather than telling them it  <br/>
seems they&#39;re hurt.  I say &quot;I really like that,&quot; instead of &quot;you seem  <br/>
proud of your work.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Think of that that would sound like to an adult!   When my children  <br/>
were young I made concessions to the fact that they were little, but  <br/>
the more they understood the more we communicated happily and  <br/>
directly.   Authentically?  Non-violently?  Those questions didn&#39;t  <br/>
come to my mind until later people told me I should be non-violent and  <br/>
authentic.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve seen &quot;be authentic&quot; used by some to prey upon or entice others&#39;  <br/>

depends on the situation, relationship, general disposition of the  <br/>
kid, and how they want help.<br/>
<br/>
Driving across country from one of the Live and Learn conferences,  <br/>
when we returned home, we couldn&#39;t find Luke&#39;s new stuffed toy  <br/>
dolphin.  He was very upset, we comforted him.  Then tried to figure  <br/>
out where it could be.  Retracing our steps, we located that  <br/>
venturous dolphin at a pizza restaurant in Kansas City.  So began the  <br/>
saga of Little Gray One&#39;s many adventures, who&#39;s been left in more  <br/>
places than a far away restaurant, and so far has always made it  <br/>
home.  We laugh when we reminisce those adventures.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve always been a big fan of positive thinking.  Positive thinking<br/>
isn&#39;t a be all end all to happiness though, and that is where I had to<br/>
come to an understanding within myself about it.  There are just things<br/>
in life that get you down and cause unhappiness, no matter how hard you<br/>
try to think positively about things.  As long as you don&#39;t get stuck in<br/>
sad, happiness comes around again.  The more your daily life is focused<br/>
on that, the easier it is to pick yourself up from sad and get back to<br/>
happy, thinking positively helps.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps its just me, but when I get to that place where everything seems<br/>
to be going wrong, I can take each of those points of wrong and find<br/>
good ways to see things.  I really wish I could live in a bigger house,<br/>
but I have a pretty decent place to live and I can find all the positive<br/>
things in it, instead of focusing on how much I&#39;d like to get out of<br/>
this teeny little house and move into a bigger one, and simultaneously<br/>
put it out there that I WILL live in a better house soon, when the<br/>
timing is right.<br/>
<br/>

instability.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Kids that grow up with more traditional parenting, where they are not<br/>
treated with respect, where they are controlled and manipulated, will<br/>
grow up believing that this is &quot;normal&quot; communication.  I see it all<br/>
around me with all kinds of people.  It&#39;s a huge disconnect that adults<br/>
don&#39;t seem to make when relating to and raising their children.  They<br/>
may even carry it over into their partner relationships.  It&#39;s cyclical.<br/>
I find it to be violent, even when it&#39;s framed in a good for you or<br/>
nicey nice sort of way.  Coersion and manipulation and disrespect are<br/>
violent, or easily escalate to violence.<br/>
<br/>
I really believe that most people are simply lacking the tools to<br/>
communicate well, and NVC seems like a way to correct that, even though<br/>
I find it very problematic in so many ways, like the ways mentioned by<br/>
Deb.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1789173598">I have also skim read NVC by Rosenberg and have found some of the &#39;scripts&#39;<br/>
contrived and &#39;inauthentic&#39; to my way of speaking. But having been brought<br/>
up &#39;mainstream&#39; with stiff upper lip suppression of all sad/negative<br/>
feelings it helped me to not pass that on to my child. I have actually<br/>
recently discussed this with my 4 year old daughter and she said instead of<br/>
saying anything I should just hold her very tight until she stops crying<br/>
(over a lost toy or hurt knee etc.) and I thought that that was a great<br/>
solutions and that&#39;s what we will be doing now, lol but it can take quite a<br/>
while. I think she also thought that I was talking too much, lol.<br/>
<br/>
I also think that NVC can have a place if you are looking for a &#39;role model&#39;<br/>
to come out of the coercive, manipulating way of speaking to children and/or<br/>

Exactly, Sandra. If it were Jayn this explanation of her problem would be <br/>
her way of asking for help (ie finding it).<br/>
<br/>
If otoh, we found the toy and she continued to cry or found something else <br/>
to cry about at once, I would then look deeper for some other stressor or <br/>
reason behind the crying. It might mean that she wanted me to sit next to <br/>
her with my arm around her for a while.<br/>

those attracted the NVC scripted response are looking for ways to  <br/>
overcome their own nasty parenting and this is the first thing they&#39;ve  <br/>
found that helps them do that? Unfortunately, these scripts can be  <br/>
followed without the real internal work required to be a more peaceful  <br/>
parent. I wonder if it doesn&#39;t just blow up in their faces at some  <br/>
point.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I find similarities in NVC-speak to the jargon of EST, Lifespring, and  <br/>
&quot;personal development&quot; programs of the 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s. You were shown  <br/>
how to manipulate people with words, but the scripts were couched in  <br/>
&quot;honest communication&quot; terms. NVC seems just another way to manipulate  <br/>
people, couched in peaceful or violent animal personas. Ick.<br/>
<br/>
I imagine those immersed in NVC would argue with me in the most  <br/>
peaceable terms - &quot;I think that you must be feeling manipulated.&quot; As  <br/>
my dd would say &quot;Duh.&quot;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah. How about that, eh?<br/>
<br/>
I get inordinately pissed off by people coming to the list wanting us  <br/>
to abide by *their* rules of communication (and maybe that&#39;s from my  <br/>
days of being momentarily brainwashed by personal development gurus).  <br/>
I don&#39;t go to NVC lists and start fights over how to talk to other  <br/>
people. I&#39;m interested in becoming a better unschooling parent, so I  <br/>
come here for that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-3146379">I have to admit, most of the groups we socialize with use NVC and in the beginning I remember feeling like I was going to burst out laughing every time I heard someone talk that way to their child.  I&#39;ve gotten more used to it now.<br/>
<br/>
I do agree that it sounds really patronizing and fake.  The one thing I do really like about it, up to age 4ish is that it helps small children give a name to their feelings.  My three year old can regularly be heard saying things like &quot;I&#39;m so frustrated with this puzzle!&quot; or &quot;I feel so lonely when I sleep by myself.&quot;  He&#39;s really learned to verbalize exactly what he feels and I think that&#39;s awesome. <br/>

=-<br/>
<br/>
I learned to be really present with my children and to care what they  <br/>
felt and to meet their needs from La Leche League.  Many have.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a central part of radical unschooling, to treat your child  <br/>
respectfully, as a real person, not as &#39;just a kid.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Many have seen and considered and shared and modelled the natural  <br/>
effects of actually caring about the other people in their families  <br/>
from unschoolers or other people in their lives.<br/>
<br/>
If a family makes the change from a script without really changing  <br/>
inside, being a different, better person who understands the changes,  <br/>
rather than imagining being a giraffe.<br/>
<br/>
For small children in a school setting, I have no doubt it can be a  <br/>
useful tool.  It&#39;s better than some other conditions in school  <br/>
settings. For example, from one article:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I went to my study and returned with my &quot;work bag,&quot; which holds my  <br/>
giraffe and jackal puppets. I put the giraffe puppet on my right hand  <br/>
and the jackal puppet on my left. I told the giraffe puppet what was  <br/>
going on for me, and she offered me empathy by guessing my feelings  <br/>
and needs. The jackal, meanwhile, interjected to my son every once in  <br/>
a while. &quot;Arrrrr!&quot; he would start, in the angriest voice I could  <br/>
muster. &quot;Hitting will solve it!&quot; My son looked concerned and said to  <br/>
the jackal: &quot;No, don&#39;t hit! Talk about it!&quot; This was a role reversal!  <br/>
My son was educating the jackal on the merits of nonviolent conflict  <br/>
resolution.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Once people are old enough not to need hand-puppet role play, it seems  <br/>
to me that pretending to be a giraffe isn&#39;t as good as direct  <br/>
information about being a *person.*<br/>

where Deb Lewis is quoted with these good points:<br/>
**************<br/>
A principle internally motivates you to do the things that seem good  <br/>
and right. People develop principles by living with people with  <br/>
principles and seeing the real benefits of such a life.<br/>
A rule externally compels you, through force, threat or punishment, to  <br/>
do the things someone else has deemed good or right. People follow or  <br/>
break rules.<br/>
<br/>
**************<br/>
<br/>
If someone &quot;becomes NVC&quot; how easy is it to fail and be wrong?  What  <br/>
happens to those who slip into jackal behavior?  Some might realize it  <br/>
and feel remorse and that will become an internal reason to be  <br/>
kinder.  For others, I&#39;m guessing, their real fear will be whether any  <br/>
of their NVC teachers/mediators/friends saw it and will judge them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That reminds me of a recent incident with my 7 year old son.  I was brushing his teeth for him (that&#39;s a whole &#39;nother story complete with reflux problems, 8 crowns, etc.) and he was insisting that I brush his bottom teeth with a certain &quot;sweeping&quot; motion that I just could not do right.  I tried for 30 minutes and no matter how I did it, I just could not satisfy him.  He kept crying and getting really angry.  <br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, it dawned on me -- there must be a deeper reason for this insistance that I brush his teeth exactly the way he wanted me to.  I recalled that earlier in the day he had lost his little toy fish at the pool.  Actually, I think some child took it home.  We searched the pool, asked everyone (had several people searching with us), looked in the grass, etc. and just could not find it.  At the time, my son was upset but went back to swimming and it seemed like he had accepted it.  <br/>
<br/>
When I realized this, I said to him, &quot;You&#39;re upset about losing your toy fish, aren&#39;t you?&quot;  He just burst out crying and said, &quot;Mommy, why would someone steal my fish?&quot;  We talked about why a child might take something that didn&#39;t belong to him/her.  We talked about how maybe next time we can &quot;protect&quot; our special belongings.  I assured him that we would look for another little fish somewhere.  We thought about making &quot;lost&quot; posters for the fish.  <br/>
<br/>
The insistance on me brushing his teeth &quot;correctly&quot; just went away.  He let me finish his teeth and we snuggled until he fell asleep.<br/>
<br/>
I thought about this incident and wondered if maybe, since my son has a need to feel in control, if maybe the loss of the toy fish made him feel a loss of control and that maybe his insistance that I brush his teeth exactly the way he wanted me to was his way of gaining back some of his control.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really cool for me because this is the first time I actually &quot;got it&quot;.  I was always reacting to my son&#39;s need for control, and this time, I looked deeper and tried to see things from his point of view.  I hope this will get easier to do.  Now that I&#39;m aware of how it all works, maybe it will.<br/>

&gt; of NVC.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No it isn&#39;t. A restatement of what has been expressed would be<br/>
something like, &quot;You&#39;re crying because you lost your toy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Is my child actually feeling sad? Perhaps he isn&#39;t. He might be<br/>
feeling angry or frustrated. Do I actually think he&#39;s feeling sad?<br/>
Who knows what I&#39;ll be thinking? What do I actually observe with my<br/>
own eyes? What is actually happening between me and my child that I<br/>
need to respond to?<br/>
<br/>
How can I say to him what somebody else who is not us says I should<br/>
say I think and be &quot;authentic&quot;??? <br/>
<br/>
The mind boggles.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps NVC scripts might be useful for helping parents out of a hole<br/>
they can&#39;t get out of by themselves, but once they&#39;re out, &quot;NVC&quot; is<br/>
for amateurs. <br/>

I have the feeling that NVC isn&#39;t particularly interested in the idea that people are special let alone real.  There&#39;s all that separatist talk about giraffes and jaguars (I think those were the animals).  It&#39;s presented as neutral yet the feeling of judgment is very much there.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Kids that grow up with more traditional parenting, where they are not treated with respect, where they are controlled and manipulated, will grow up believing that this is &quot;normal&quot; communication.  I see it all around me with all kinds of people.  It&#39;s a huge disconnect that adults don&#39;t seem to make when relating to and raising their children.  They may even carry it over into their partner relationships.  It&#39;s cyclical.&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Absolutely.  I&#39;ve experienced this as a child and a married adult.  It&#39;s the way I grew up and it&#39;s the way I easily thoughtlessly automatically reacted to every situation I didn&#39;t like because that&#39;s how anything I did that others didn&#39;t like when I was a kid was reacted to.  That&#39;s what I learned.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I really believe that most people are simply lacking the tools to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>communicate well, and NVC seems like a way to correct that, even though I find it very problematic in so many ways, like the ways mentioned by Deb.&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Just realizing how my communication and thoughts *were* violent or at least destructive was enough to get me on my way.  If a NVC book is the first time anyone sees that, then it&#39;s useful.  The scripts can be dispensed with though in my opinion because natural speech will evolve from the simple realization of how one is communicating ineffectively as well as unnecessarily harshly.  <br/>
<br/>
The only use for the scripts that I found was the idea of rephrasing to myself what the needs to be met are as derived from what people say.  In my head.  Not aloud.  I don&#39;t have to think  with my mouth.  If I&#39;m wrong about the need a person is trying to get met, then I&#39;ll find out when I say something like &quot;oh can I get you a glass of water then?&quot;.. MY kid will say what he wants &quot;no I want milk.&quot;  Oh ok.  Easy enough.  He&#39;s thirsty.  Without me having to go through telling him that it seems to me he&#39;s thirsty or hungry or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t identify well with NVC because it seems to assume people are either/or NOT both/and.  I&#39;m sometimes a &quot;jaguar&quot; sometimes a &quot;giraffe&quot; in NVC lingo.  I&#39;m not one or the other but both sometimes all mixed together and confusedly.  I guess I find it easier to think of things in terms of being more human when I hear the word authentic.  I&#39;m a human being.  Uncovering how to be more myself in human terms is easier than living up to something that isn&#39;t me or my child.</div>

 </span></blockquote>I would have to say one of Karl&#39;s things has been to name what he&#39;s feeling.  That comes from knowing (like breathing) that his feelings are important.  Brian and I decided Karl&#39;s feelings are important to consider very early on.  We grew up in families where that definitely wasn&#39;t the case.  Feelings are such an big part of communicating.<br/>
<br/>
I never used NVC scripts to talk to others and I don&#39;t recall any other scripts either.  It&#39;s hard for me to remember the durned lyrics to songs I like --I wish I was better at that-- let alone scripts!  I&#39;ve never been a good memorizer.</div>

<br/>
The either/or thing gets in the way a lot doesn&#39;t it?  I remember a<br/>
quote from a Tom Robbins book, that went something like this &quot;there are<br/>
two kinds of people in the world, those that believe there are only two<br/>
kinds of people and those that don&#39;t&quot;.  There are always many more sides<br/>
to everything, people included!</div>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Apparently too many Twinkies can easily escalate to murder, or driving<br/>
&gt; while sleepy can lead to manslaughter. But being sleepy isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; manslaughter, and a Twinkie isn&#39;t murder.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I pulled this from Katherine&#39;s post, the first bit quoted from Deb&#39;s<br/>
post and the second from Katherine:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;And about NVC stuff - I suspect if normal communication seems<br/>
&gt; violent or threatening to some people they&#39;re suffering from emotional<br/>
 </span></blockquote>instability.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Just realizing how my communication and thoughts *were* violent or at<br/>
 </span></blockquote>least destructive was enough to get me on my way. If a NVC book is the<br/>
first time anyone sees that, then it&#39;s useful. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I had meant to comment yesterday too, but got distracted... NVC uses the<br/>
term violent to describe communication.  I thought about that a lot<br/>
yesterday.  Violence infers physicality.  I can easily see how words and<br/>
thoughts turn to action, and words and thoughts that are coersive,<br/>
manipulative, and disrespectful, can easily turn to violent actions. <br/>
I&#39;ve seen it, but, like Sandra so aptly pointed out, the words and<br/>
communication themselves are not violence, violence is violence.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s interesting that NVC uses, or rather mis uses language and perhaps<br/>
that is it&#39;s biggest problematic aspect.  It muddies thought and direct<br/>
clear communication.  So, while it&#39;s great that a parent can recognize<br/>
that a child is terribly upset about a missing toy, the clearest<br/>
communication that a child could receive from the parent, would be<br/>
actions taken to recover the missing toy.  Some parents, and this is<br/>
probably where the recognition of feelings comes in, wouldn&#39;t even<br/>
notice or care that a child was upset about a missing  toy, the child is<br/>
just being a whiner, crying and making a bunch of irritating noise, and<br/>
the parent feels compelled to stop the irritating noise.  It&#39;s a very<br/>
selfish existence to dismiss others in this manner, yet it happens and<br/>
it&#39;s very commonplace.<br/>

can&#39;t pinpoint the &quot;how&quot; of it.) Although my other children who weren&#39;t<br/>
immersed in NVC weren&#39;t that way....more of the screaming, crying,<br/>
tantruming, aggressive behavior without any words to verbalize what they<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Perhaps your other kids who weren&#39;t immersed in NVC, didn&#39;t have a mom<br/>
who could name feelings either.  The kids you had that did name<br/>
feelings, had a mom that learned how to name feelings and how to help<br/>
her kids name feelings.  NVC may have helped you learn how to do that,<br/>
but I&#39;ve never immersed myself in NVC, and I&#39;ve learned how to help my<br/>
kids name feelings simply by talking to them like real human beings.<br/>
<br/>
Feelings exist, it&#39;s a simple and plain fact of human nature, in which<br/>
our kids aren&#39;t exempt from.  Helping them navigate that part of<br/>
themselves is a part of helping them grow and mature, in the same way<br/>
that you help them know that stoves can be hot and crossing streets can<br/>
be dangerous.</div>
