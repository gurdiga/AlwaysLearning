<div id="ygrps-yiv-242289606">How exciting!<br/>
<br/>
Are you on either or both of these yahoos groups ?<br/>
<br/>
families on the road (fotr)<br/>
unschooling families on the road (an off shoot)<br/>
<br/>
National Parks may be an option.  I will also look for the web links of jobs while on the road.<br/>
