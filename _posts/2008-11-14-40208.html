<div id="ygrps-yiv-2095778308">Hi,<br/>
I am new to the group, and I have been reading these posts with  <br/>
interest.<br/>
My DS is turning 2 in December.<br/>
I would like to comment on the following:<br/>
<br/>
-=-No amount of love, attachment or holding solved it. -=-<br/>
<br/>
*Unschooling isn&#39;t about colic. A mother of a colicky firstborn<br/>
doesn&#39;t know whether she&#39;s going to put that child in school. But<br/>
one way or the other, if love, attachment and holding don&#39;t &quot;solve<br/>
it,&quot; do they make it better? Do they help create a relationship for<br/>
the during and after that? Is love better than anger? Is attachment<br/>
better than putting him in a crib and setting the alarm for morning<br/>
feeding time? Is holding better than ignoring?*<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Logan cried  a lot, and was terribly gassy until almost 6 months.<br/>
My husband and I carried him constantly, he nursed, (and still does),  <br/>
and he slept with us, (still does).<br/>
None of this stopped him from crying, neither of us were raised this  <br/>
way,<br/>
but our instincts told us to keep him close all the time.<br/>
Now we have a sweet, affectionate little boy who knows that mom and dad<br/>
are in his corner whether he is smiling and happy, or melting down and  <br/>
angry.<br/>
The point is, attachment parenting has already taught him trust.<br/>
This led us to the concept of unschooling.<br/>
We want him to continue to trust and have choices, and frankly, I  <br/>
don&#39;t believe sending him to school will further those goals.<br/>
I met an adult who had been unschooled about a year ago. and then I  <br/>
read John Holt.<br/>
I am so grateful for this group because I do feel like we are heading  <br/>
into unchartered, but exciting waters.<br/>
