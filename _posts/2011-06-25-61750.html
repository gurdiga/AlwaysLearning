<div id="ygrps-yiv-534730351">I had downloaded a little math game which I really liked playing with my daughter. It was a little like this one (look and principle) : <br/>

<br/>
though easier (which is why I would like to find it again). <br/>
<br/>
You also had to remove blocks of numbers which add up to equal a number appearing on the right-hand side of the screen - but you could see the numbers in advance (they were stacking up) and you had a few &quot;magic weapons&quot; to help you if you were stuck (a bomb, and things like that). <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t remember the name of this game (my computer crashed down and I don&#39;t have the game anymore) and I&#39;m searching Internet like crazy to find it. <br/>
<br/>
If it rings a bell to anybody, it would be greatly appreciated by my daughter and me. <br/>
<br/>
Many thanks in advance<br/>
