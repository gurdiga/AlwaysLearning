<div id="ygrps-yiv-685103411">We&#39;ve had so many really great experiences and happy learning going <br/>
on lately, I wanted to write about a couple cool moments.<br/>
<br/>
We live with a wetlands butting up to our property, a smallish pond <br/>
with turtles, fish and even occasional herons or hawks dropping <br/>
in....yes, right in the middle of town.  The pond has provided a lot <br/>
of interest all along, but a couple of weeks ago, the pond moved into <br/>
our yard in the form of an egg laying turtle.<br/>
She hiked all the way from the pond in the back of the house, to the <br/>
front yard (almost to the sidewalk) and started digging a hole. Dh <br/>
saw her and called us out to watch. She began depositing eggs in the <br/>
hole as we observed, really cool! So now we&#39;re anxiously watching the <br/>
area and hoping to see baby turtled heading for the pond at some <br/>
point.<br/>
I set up a water garden not far from the pond and the kids have been <br/>
happily trying to gater tadpoles and fish to live in our water <br/>
garden. It&#39;s trickier than it would seem. They&#39;ve had a bucket, a <br/>
pole and a shovel at different times, trying to scoop and scare <br/>
things into being caught. So far, mostly failure. But we&#39;ve had fun <br/>
and I managed to gather three tadpoles yesterday. Jared said &quot;those <br/>
aren&#39;t new tadpoles, I think they&#39;re in stage three already&quot;. He <br/>
knows the stages of tadpoles? Cripes, where do they learn this stuff?<br/>
<br/>
A local storyteller invited us to his performance at Jazzfest on <br/>
Sunday, so Sierra, Jalen and I headed down to watch, while Mark and <br/>
the boys went up to the college track for some frisbee and golf <br/>
practice.<br/>
We spread our blanket out under a big oak tree and listened to a band <br/>
perform before Mike came on. Jalen was boogeying, running in circles <br/>
getting the blanket all dirty and hiding in some bushes behind us.<br/>
When Mike started, the kids all gathered around his feet and helped <br/>
with the performance. It was so cute to see Jalen and Sierra jamming <br/>
on kazoos and harmonicas...I think Jalen got more spit flowing than <br/>
sound! :)<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday was a cool moment too....even though we just hung out at <br/>
home and mostly stayed in due to rain (except for pond ventures). Our <br/>
Playstation had quit working about 1.5 weeks ago, I figured all of <br/>
our electronic equipment was going to start dying or something! <br/>
Trevor had taken it apart himself and tried to clean it and make sure <br/>
it wasn&#39;t just dust. Didn&#39;t work.<br/>
So last night, he decided to research typical Playstation problems <br/>
and how to fix it yourself. He was determined. He spent about 45 <br/>
minutes online trying to find the info. he needed...most of the &quot;fix <br/>
it yourself&quot; type guides cost about $35 and he&#39;d decided it was going <br/>
to be free. His determination paid off and he went back to his room <br/>
and took the durn thing apart again. I saw him in their with about 50 <br/>
Q-tips, cleaning the laser and various parts he&#39;d read about.<br/>
And it worked! The Playstation that they were ready to ditch is <br/>
working fine, and he has the satisfaction of knowing that he figured <br/>
it out himself. Even my dh didn&#39;t have a clue how to deal with the <br/>
thing. Unschooling rocks.<br/>
