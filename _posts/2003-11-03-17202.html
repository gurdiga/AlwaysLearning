 </span></blockquote>Maybe.  She sees a lot of high school kids between our house and Active <br/>
Imagination where Kirby works.  The little corner strip mall building thing where <br/>
that shop is is built right in the corner of the bigger corner which houses the <br/>
high school Kirby and Marty don&#39;t attend &lt;g&gt;.  To the south is the soccer <br/>
field and gym.  To the east is the parking lot and all else.  So at lunch kids <br/>
come into that mall (I wish I could sketch a picture of it here, it would be so <br/>
much easier) and there are places to hang out which aren&#39;t porches of stores.  <br/>
Holly sees that they abandon backpacks (or forget them or swipe and leave <br/>
them in public places just to annoy or inconvenienc others), she sees some kids <br/>
being alone, she sees kids looking irritated.  She sees them walking home, some <br/>
looking bummed, but others  walking REALLY fast and heads up and we&#39;ve talked <br/>
about that.  Some are anxious to get home.  For some, home is just going to <br/>
be chores and requirements.   For some (as for me when I was in school) every <br/>
moment spent with other people is milked and so they stall and find reasons to <br/>
go slowly.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s off the going to school kick now anyway and on to something else.  We <br/>
talked, and she said she&#39;d ask her friend Kitlin to just show her all her books <br/>
and homework sometime.<br/>
<br/>
SHE SCARED ME, though.  Maybe it was just halloween special effects, for her. <br/>

 Maybe you could get an honest weekly schedule from a kid her age which <br/>
shows all the time school takes, from getting ready to go, to staying <br/>
all day, to the work at night.   Heidi<br/>

<br/>
Good point!  <br/>
She&#39;s rarely up early enough to see any kids go to school. <br/>
<br/>
When we talked about this yesterday, when I asked her if she was serious <br/>
about wanting to go to school, she said she wouldn&#39;t want to go to a school with <br/>
any strict dress codes, and why did they have those dress codes anyway?  I told <br/>
her if she dressed as she usually dresses, it would be more interesting for <br/>
kids to look at her than to listen to the teacher, so teachers liked kids to be <br/>
more boring than they were. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Maybe you could get an honest weekly schedule from a kid her age which <br/>
shows all the time school takes, from getting ready to go, to staying <br/>
all day, to the work at night.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
YEAH!  And wake her up and get her dressed and feed her and then make sure <br/>
she eats NOTHING for at least three hours, not one bite, and then make sure the <br/>
food is three hours old or more (or randomly chosen for her &lt;bwg&gt;) and then no <br/>
food for another three hours.  <br/>
<br/>
That would last about two... hours.<br/>

That&#39;s exactly what I did for my then-6-yo dd last year when she wanted to<br/>
go to school so badly. I told her we&#39;d have a &quot;school day&quot; and she pestered<br/>
me until we did. I got her up and dressed and fed and out the door by 7 (a<br/>
minor miracle there!) and we followed the local school bus on its route<br/>
until she was bored. I told her she would be talking to her friends during<br/>
this time, but she was a little grumpy from the early hour. Then we came<br/>
home and she perked up when she saw the desk and chalkboard I had set up. I<br/>
gave her worksheets and taught a couple of lessons, we had story time, etc.<br/>
It was cute when she would insist on my calling her by different names every<br/>
time she raised her hand, so she could act out all her classmates! She had<br/>
to raise her hand for permission to sharpen her pencil and go to the<br/>
bathroom, and when she was hungry I reminded her that lunch wasn&#39;t until 11.<br/>
I didn&#39;t try to make it seem horrible; I didn&#39;t have to. I remained cheerful<br/>
and upbeat. After lunch (chicken nuggets, peas, ketchup, jello, milk: sound<br/>
familiar?) she had &quot;recess,&quot; and when I told her it was time to return to<br/>
her desk, she looked sad and I asked her if she wanted our experiment to<br/>
end. She said &quot;yes!&quot; Her memory of all that is that you starve at school,<br/>
and it&#39;s too early in the day. She hasn&#39;t expressed interest since, although<br/>
she did want to go to a local homeschooler science class this year that<br/>
she&#39;s really enjoying. I think 90 minutes once a week is schooly enough to<br/>
get that urge out of her system. <br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s interesting is that when people ask her where she goes to school,<br/>
she&#39;ll tell them the name of the science center. She never says she<br/>
homeschools, or unschools. Those aren&#39;t concepts for her. What she does<br/>
there is school, and what we do here is life, and I like that! :)<br/>

Holly used to go to dance classes, and when other little girls talked about <br/>
their teachers, she would talk about her dance teacher, so she wasn&#39;t left out. <br/>
 Just little things like &quot;What&#39;s your teacher&#39;s name?&quot; or &quot;So you like your <br/>
teacher?&quot; allowed her to stay in the conversation instead of having to say &quot;I <br/>
don&#39;t have one.&quot;<br/>
