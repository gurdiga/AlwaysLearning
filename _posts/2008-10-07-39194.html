OK, so how does that &quot;disconnection&quot; differ from that of, say, Charlotte&#39;s Web, Little House on the Prairie, Sarah Plain and Tall, Lord of the Flies, King Lear, Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin, Mary Queen of Scots, Tale of Two Cities, Tom Sawyer....I could go on and on.<br/>

How are *all* those books, which were required reading for me and/or Cameron, any more connected to our &quot;real lives&quot; to have any educational value?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know that &quot;educators&quot; really understand how things *ARE* actually connected. How can they NOT see that online fantasy worlds are *just* as connected to &quot;real life&quot; as any of the reading they require of children?<br/>

Guessing...<br/>
<br/>
Because you were respectfully reading the enshrined words of &quot;real  <br/>
authors,&quot; in a book made of paper, and bound with a nice cover.  You  <br/>
were doing it because adults told you to do it, and you were obedient.<br/>
<br/>
Playing a video game isn&#39;t respecting someone else&#39;s literary  <br/>
offering, it&#39;s not what they do in school, and it&#39;s not done at the  <br/>
insistence of a parent or a teacher.  It doesn&#39;t look like a book.   <br/>
You can&#39;t write home to great grandma and said &quot;Marty has read Uncle  <br/>
Tom&#39;s Cabin&quot;  [SERIOUSLY!?  Kelly, I do&#39;nt think people in the real  <br/>
world (outside of the SE U.S., I mean) read that book at all, unless  <br/>
it&#39;s for background understanding of The King and I.]<br/>
<br/>
There is doing what grandparents think is valuable (good)<br/>
and there is doing what grandparents don&#39;t understand (worthless)<br/>
and we poor parents are caught in the middle.  Poor parents.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1594185257">Unfortunately most people have a warped perception of reality and  <br/>
connection. If it doesn&#39;t involve the correct amount of pain,  <br/>
suffering, and disappointment it must not be real. If one isn&#39;t clear  <br/>
about what rung of the social ladder they have climbed to, then it  <br/>
must not be real. I could go on and on. For me to presume that the  <br/>
only way for children to connect is the way that I &quot;connected&quot; as a  <br/>
child would be dangerous. There is very little of Shelby&#39;s childhood  <br/>
that resembles mine. For this I am grateful.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I came across something cool about the history of reading the other day.<br/>
<br/>
------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br/>
-------------------<br/>
<br/>
Consider this passage on the Benedictine Rule, from Southern&#39;s Making  <br/>
of the Middle Ages:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The Rule laid down how the reading was to be done: the monk was to  <br/>
read the whole book and read it straight through�there was to be no  <br/>
&#39;skipping&#39;, no laying ot it aside and taking up something else,  <br/>
nothing light-hearted about it. It was part of a discipline, an  <br/>
exercise in a penitential life. The part of the Rule which regulates  <br/>
the monastic reading comes, significantly, in the chapter on manual  <br/>
labour: the reading envisaged by the Rule was a painful business�it  <br/>
was meant to be.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Southern is referring to Rule 48, &#39;Of Daily Work&#39;, which adds:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Above all, let one or two of the seniors be appointed to go about  <br/>
the monastery during the time that the brethren devote to reading and  <br/>
take notice, lest perhaps a slothful brother be found who giveth  <br/>
himself up to idleness or vain talk, and doth not attend to his  <br/>
reading, and is unprofitable, not only to himself, but disturbeth  <br/>
also others.&quot;<br/>
------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
It was from a pompous blog, but those quotes were fascinating.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not real reading unless it&#39;s painful and you&#39;re reading it  <br/>
against your own wishes. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2146001974">The disconnection that many people don&#39;t talk about has to do with much more<br/>
than education.  Many parents want *more* control not less.  Video games<br/>
don&#39;t provide that.  In their thinking, video games come right between them<br/>
and their children.<br/>
<br/>
Some might see video gaming as a cultural void, which many people don&#39;t see<br/>
as viably filled up if it&#39;s the young and inexperienced who are doing the<br/>
filling up of it.  Well, it&#39;s make believe right?  There have probably<br/>
always been people who worry about children being too imaginative or out in<br/>
space, with not enough focus on reality.  They might also worry about kids<br/>
getting the idea that fantasy is real or that they have the ability to make<br/>
their crazy stories reality.  Video games play into a lot of feelings like<br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
Out of their depth, parents might also feel they&#39;re rapidly losing ground.<br/>
For some, there&#39;s a fear that the basic structure of video games is<br/>
mind-altering in some insidious, subversive or evil way.  Somebody in<br/>
computer programming unknown to the parents --who might not even be parents<br/>
themselves-- developed the game.  The parents don&#39;t know who these people<br/>
are.  This could be a valid fear when we consider that school is very<br/>
systematic and channels people a certain way.<br/>
<br/>
My opinion is that the best protective measure (where we see a need for it)<br/>
is to enable children to move through and critically assess their world as<br/>
independently as possible at an early age.  People (even children) who are<br/>
agents in decision-making are much more difficult to stupefy or program or<br/>
mess with.  Some of the benefits:  The sooner children realize that they<br/>
sometimes make fouled up decisions, the more realistically they are able to<br/>
learn from them.  Also the younger a person is, the less damaging the<br/>
decisions in play are likely to be.<br/>
<br/>
People who think they&#39;re breaking the rules to think unconventionally or<br/>
make their own decisions are easily pushed/rushed into letting others make<br/>
decisions for them.  In most modern wars, the first people to protest, take<br/>
social action and/or go into exile were the free thinkers.  They wouldn&#39;t go<br/>
along with the program.  They objected and asked sticky questions.  Many of<br/>
these people were independently educated.<br/>
<br/>
First we want to be able to see our children primarily as people with the<br/>
capacity to make important decisions.  (Not saying that children can make<br/>
all the important decisions or that they exist in some vacuum where the<br/>
parents offer no help.)  That&#39;s simple.  It&#39;s doable.  Unschoolers are doing<br/>
that!  Many people can&#39;t say that and it&#39;s scary for some of them to hear<br/>
about parents who *can* say it.<br/>
<br/>
As a Christian, may I say one could, if so inclined, take the above and<br/>
multiply by an extra percentage of relevance, and see a much bigger<br/>
disconnection than secular people do in video games.<br/>

<br/>
One thing I have seen people do is play games (or do other things)  <br/>
simply because their parents don&#39;t like it.   It&#39;s a passive- <br/>
aggressive act of foot-dragging or defiance (depending on the attitude).<br/>
<br/>
With kids who have had choices all along, they won&#39;t play a game they  <br/>
don&#39;t like, and they will have to reason to play a game to spite a  <br/>
parent.<br/>
