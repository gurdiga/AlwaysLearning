<div id="ygrps-yiv-2129819007">I just wanted to give people who are required to submit a portfolio review a heads up about the new Virtual Jump Start Games.<br/>
<br/>
I am not suggesting them as a learning tool, although that would be ok too, if the kids liked them, but as a way to show reviewers what the child can do in edu-speak.  The website sends the parent progress reports that the kids never have to see.  This, in addition to my blog, was all my reviewer really needed.<br/>
<br/>
My son just started the 2nd grade Virtual Jump Start and can&#39;t get enough.  It is similar to Wizards 101, but not as cool:).  The games kind of serve the purpose of a skills test, but besides being bombarded with &quot;Good Jobs&quot;, there are no scores or grades.<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to put this out there because I know some people have to be evaluated at the end of the year and this is a stress free and fun thing to add to a portfolio.  It is great for us because my son does very little writing and all of his math is mental math, so I don&#39;t have a lot to show in the areas of math and reading (besides our reading list).<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps someone who might be struggling the idea of a portfolio review.  Of course states have different laws and people need to know what is required for their state.  <br/>
