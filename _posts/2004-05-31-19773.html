Anyway, Janene and Lexie and I are watching Indiana Jones.  At one <br/>
point, Janene, who has seen the movie more than once, says, just as a <br/>
bloody scene is coming up &quot;is anyone going to cover my eyes?  If you are <br/>
going to cover my eyes, now&#39;s the time!  Fine, I&#39;ll cover them myself.&quot;  <br/>
And does so. Then she says &quot;OK, can I look yet?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I just found that too sweet.<br/>
<br/>
A bit earlier in the movie there is the scene where everyone is served <br/>
chilled monkey brains.  Lexie says &quot;yuck!  Monkey brains are better <br/>
served warm!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I enjoy watching these classics with my children.  Such fun to <br/>
experience them all again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-648971561">We enjoyed watching the Indiana Jones movies as well....and we did some eye<br/>
covering...me included!!! I always ask &quot;do you want to know when to cover<br/>
your eyes?&quot;  Only my 8 yos does anymore....so he and I sit together with a<br/>
blanket to hide under while everyone else watches!  And our question to find<br/>
answers to today...do they really eat that stuff in India? Or was it just<br/>
for shock value?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-592393656">This reminds me of something Nick said recently. He just turned 11 and<br/>
is just beginning to become a little more aware of modesty - his and<br/>
ours (OK, he&#39;s a late bloomer :o)). Anyway, we&#39;ve always dressed and<br/>
undressed around each other but the other day I was getting undressed<br/>
for bed and he was laying in the bed with his book and he looks at me<br/>
and says, &quot;A little immodest there, aren&#39;t we? Shouldn&#39;t you at least<br/>
drape my eyes?&quot; I couldn&#39;t help but bust out laughing although he<br/>
failed to see what was so funny.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-568535093">My little girl is funny with this sometimes. She&#39;ll say, &quot;I can only <br/>
watch that video if I have my hat.&quot; Then she hides her face when the <br/>
scary parts come on.<br/>
