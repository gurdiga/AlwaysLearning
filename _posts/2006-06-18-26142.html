<div id="ygrps-yiv-2140613875">Just a gentle reminder than the Live and Learn Unschooling Conference&#39;s <br/>
Early Bird deadline is approaching. It&#39;s only two weeks away---the end <br/>
of this month: June 30, 2006.<br/>
<br/>
 Funshop and scholarship requests are also due by the end of June.<br/>

  &quot;The hardest problem for the brain is not learning, but forgetting. No <br/>
matter how hard we try, we can&#39;t deliberately forget something we have <br/>
learned, and that is catastrophic if we learn that we can&#39;t learn.&quot; <br/>
