<div id="ygrps-yiv-1409807264">Here&#39;s a Goethe quote I stumbled across.<br/>
<br/>
=========<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I have come to the frightening conclusion that I am the decisive  <br/>
element. It is my personal approach that creates the climate. It is  <br/>
my daily mood that makes the weather. I possess tremendous power to  <br/>
make life miserable or joyous. I can be a tool of torture or an  <br/>
instrument of inspiration, I can humiliate or humor, hurt or heal. In  <br/>
all situations, it is my response that decides whether a crisis is  <br/>
escalated or de-escalated, and a person is humanized or de-humanized.  <br/>
If we treat people as they are, we make them worse. If we treat  <br/>
people as they ought to be, we help them become what they are capable  <br/>
of becoming.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe<br/>
