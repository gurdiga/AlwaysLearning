<div id="ygrps-yiv-359030955">I don&#39;t understand what this means: &quot;I choose to take an independent  <br/>
stance on meeting my children&#39;s needs.&quot; Does that mean you aren&#39;t  <br/>
unschooling? Does it mean you have no interest in being an unschooler?<br/>
<br/>
 From the list description:<br/>
<br/>
This is a list for the examination of the philosophy of unschooling  <br/>
and attentive parenting and a place for sharing examined lives based  <br/>
on the principles underlying unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to highlight &quot;Sharing examined lives based on the principles  <br/>
underlying unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Do you think that if you reveal your parenting or schooling philosophy  <br/>
here, you will be challenged by the list members to see things  <br/>
differently? It&#39;s likely to happen. It&#39;s what usually happens. Then  <br/>
the owners, moderators and list members help people who want to  <br/>
unschool to move in that direction.<br/>
<br/>
If you just want to take without giving, then it&#39;s okay to read and  <br/>
not post. Plenty of people do that.<br/>
<br/>
I think we should get back to discussing unschooling now &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

&gt; Subject: Do you have research<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hi Robin<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I hope this email I sent to the group explains why I�m here.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I hear that you are very angry Sandra that I choose to take an  <br/>
&gt; independent stance on meeting my children�s needs and that you would  <br/>
&gt; prefer it if I went away. I enquired regarding research as I�d like  <br/>
&gt; to know more about the Acha �always learning?�  I�m not trying to  <br/>
&gt; teach anyone anything merely trying to discover how best to meet  <br/>
&gt; children�s needs which is an ongoing and life time process.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am not here to threaten your group, promote myself, or  to be  <br/>
&gt; judged by you. I remain always interested in learning how to be a  <br/>
&gt; better person and parent.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Best wishes<br/>
