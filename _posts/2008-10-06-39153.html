<div id="ygrps-yiv-671903684">greetings all!  my name is rowena, i am the mom to a spectacular five <br/>
year old named ella, and wife to a spectacular husband named rudi.  i <br/>
have been reading the list for a couple of months now so as to learn <br/>
before posting, but now i have a question that i hope some of you can <br/>
help me with.<br/>
<br/>
ella has a little playmate who is obsessed with the disney princesse, <br/>
and now ella is obsessed with them too.  while i don&#39;t have anything <br/>
against princesses generally, i&#39;m challenged to learn what this <br/>
particular interest means to ella.  i have never been a huge fan of <br/>
disney, but we haven&#39;t banned them from our home--we just never <br/>
watched the movies until ella&#39;s friend introduced them to her.  what <br/>
do they mean to her?  what does she learn from THESE princesses, as <br/>
opposed to other, more generic princesses?  and how do i explain why <br/>
we can&#39;t buy all these toys and books and costumes and auxillary <br/>
items when this young friend has EVERY. PIECE. OF. DISNEY. PRINCESS. <br/>
MERCHANDISE?<br/>
<br/>
i hope these questions make sense.  we don&#39;t want or need to try to <br/>
control our child&#39;s interests, but i do want to understand them, esp. <br/>
because i have never been a &quot;princessy&quot; type of person.<br/>
<br/>
thank you for your indulgence in what might seem very small concern <br/>
to some people.  i look forward to learning from all of you and hope <br/>
that i can even contribute as well.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Welcome to the wonderful world of unschooling! And one of the most  <br/>
basic tenets is trust. You may sometime see what it is Ella is  <br/>
getting out of PrincessLand - and I encourage you to spend some time  <br/>
seeing if you can figure it out - but you may also never know. And  <br/>
that&#39;s okay. Trust that is something she needs.<br/>
<br/>
When she was around 4, my daughter Zoe (now 19), used to trace  <br/>
letters with little objects. Sometimes she would trace with a pen or  <br/>
pencil and make marks, and sometimes she would just trace invisibly  <br/>
with a tiny teapot or whatever was at hand. To this day, I really  <br/>
don&#39;t know what she got out of that, but she spent a lot of  <br/>
concentrated time doing it. She is a lovely, capable, kind person, so  <br/>
I assume whatever it was - was good!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When my daughter was 8, after she came out of 2 months of trying  <br/>
second grade, she spent several months churning out what she called  <br/>
snowflakes but looked like giant asterisks. Hundreds of them, often  <br/>
in pen, sometimes different colors. She was always good at drawing so  <br/>
the asterisks were baffling! Then one day she creating this great  <br/>
drawing of a stapler laying on the floor, better than she&#39;d drawn pre- <br/>
asterisk. I have no idea what that was all about but she needed to do  <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The Disney people are pretty savvy about what will appeal to a large  <br/>
number of girls! ;-) Just like most kids are drawn to primary colors  <br/>
and bold patterns, the Disney style princesses are designed to match  <br/>
a need in a lot of kids (mostly girls).<br/>
<br/>
But I wouldn&#39;t see that as a bad (greedy corporate) thing any more  <br/>
than selling blocks in bright colors is bad. Kids have a need and  <br/>
Disney has a way of meeting it. For other kids it might be Pokemon  <br/>
or ... I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m out of the kid hits loop now! ;-)<br/>
<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You can&#39;t. Not in a way she can understand but sympathy can help.  <br/>
Maybe help her fantasize about what she could do if they could all  <br/>
magically appear in her house. You can find a way to work it into the  <br/>
budget so she can get a few. Maybe work together on cutting back the  <br/>
food budget and she can see the savings building up. It might be a  <br/>
bit much for a 5 yo but really depends on the 5 yo. Salvation Army or  <br/>
Goodwill.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously money comes up a lot. If you type budget or buying into the  <br/>
search box in the archives, some threads might pop up  that have  <br/>
other, more creative ideas.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1778700981">Hi,<br/>
when my dd 7 was &quot;into&quot; the princesses we did not have much money, so<br/>
i used the charity shops (here in england, thrift store where u r) a<br/>
lot for costumes, sometimes got lucky.  also made princesses out of<br/>
salt dough. pictures of disney princesses from magazines, glued them<br/>
onto card, sticky back plastic over the top and cut round to make a<br/>
&quot;figure&quot;, put on a straw and made puppet princesses.  my dd was not<br/>
really aware then that there was manufactured stuff out there and was<br/>
happy with our homemade creations.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-181543654">I actually have an almost 5 year old daughter that is going through the <br/>
same thing- although it is more princesses in general.  she has a new <br/>
best friend who just LOVES princesses and anything shiny and pink and <br/>
dancy.  We are not big princess people either.  other than our daughter <br/>
we have 3 sons.  My husband, even more than me, is struggling with this <br/>
but i guess when it comes down to it they are just trying on things, <br/>
exploring their worlds and will come out on the otherside better off as <br/>
long as well dont put down their current passions. It is pretty funny <br/>
though to see my daughter, all dressed in tights and a frilly dress <br/>
running through a mud puddle with her brothers.</div>

<h4>emiLy Q.</h4>
<time> 6 Oct 2008, at  8:52pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-498610844">I have no idea what your daughter is getting out of the disney princesses,<br/>
but I can share a little of our experience.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter will be 5 in a few weeks.  She has loved princesses for years.<br/>
She wore a Cinderella dress EVERY DAY for over a year.  She pretends to be a<br/>
princess, watches the movies until the discs don&#39;t work anymore.  We make a<br/>
copy for her to watch when we first buy them, and she is on copy #2 and 3 of<br/>
some.  Dancing, twirling, demanding that she is a &quot;real&quot; princess and that I<br/>
am a queen...<br/>
<br/>
Today.  Today we were looking up the real story of Robin Hood and Maid<br/>
Marian, and REAL queens and princesses (they look like normal people!).<br/>
Tonight the last thing she did before she fell asleep was whisper<br/>
&quot;Switzerland&quot; into my ear.  It&#39;s a joke, because earlier today on Spongebob<br/>
Squarepants, Mr. Crabs tried to sell someone a junky umbrella by saying it<br/>
was once the Queen of Switzerland&#39;s.  (It was full of holes.)  There is no<br/>
queen of Switzerland.<br/>
<br/>
So, the princess thing isn&#39;t all bad.  And just wait until it&#39;s Spongebob!<br/>
:)<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is a lot of low-cost Disney princess stuff - Target very very  <br/>
often has it in the $1 bins.<br/>
<br/>
I, myself, love the Disney princesses. My daughter played Belle in  <br/>
Beauty and the Beast a few yeas ago and it was glorious!<br/>
<br/>
We go to Disneyland a lot and they have a Disney princesses area these  <br/>
days that is almost my favorite part of Disneyland.<br/>
<br/>
Here is what their website says about it:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Enter the enchanted world of &quot;happily ever after&quot; where little  <br/>
princesses and knights are invited to a royal gathering. Immersive  <br/>
storytelling, fun crafts, including sparkling crowns to decorate, and  <br/>
regal ceremonies make this a fairytale experience come true.<br/>
<br/>
Activities at the royal gathering include:<br/>
<br/>
     * Disney Princess Storytelling — Join a Disney Princess for a  <br/>
special story where Guests are invited to help tell the tales.<br/>
     * Royal Coronation Ceremony — Learn what it takes to be a true  <br/>
princess or knight with a regal celebration.<br/>
     * Royal Dance — After taking the Royal Oath, Guests are invited  <br/>
to take part in a lively group dance.<br/>
     * Royal Arrivals — Three Disney Princesses make their grand  <br/>
entrance and greet their Guests.<br/>
     * And many more royal celebrations.<br/>
&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
So - maybe if there is no way you can save enough money for a vacation  <br/>
there, you can put on a Disney Princess Fantasy Faire of your own.<br/>
<br/>
My advice to you is REVEL in it. The Disney princesses are so fun -  <br/>
the movies are so great, the music is wonderful, the costumes  <br/>
gorgeous. What&#39;s not to love? Beauty and the Beast is one of my all- <br/>
time favorite movies - not favorite children&#39;s movie, I mean favorite  <br/>
movie in general. It is the only animated movie to have been nominated  <br/>
for an academy award for best picture, I think, so I guess I&#39;m not the  <br/>
only one who loves it. Maybe rent all the movies in order and have  <br/>
Disney princess night once a week. Make some food to go along with it  <br/>
- baked apples for Snow White, for example!<br/>
<br/>
Make costumes - seriously. My girls never had a single store-bought  <br/>
Disney princess dress, in spite of spending time in the Disney store  <br/>
very often. We made costumes a lot, though. When they are involved in  <br/>
the designing and making, they aren&#39;t nitpicky about how accurate the  <br/>
costume is, in my experience.<br/>
<br/>
If you go to Joanne&#39;s Fabrics or Michaels you&#39;ll find a lot of crafts  <br/>
that are Disney Princess related - simple embroidery and cross stitch,  <br/>
plastic canvass things, latch hook rugs, paint by number, shrinky  <br/>
dinks, beads, and on and on. There are a zillion stickers out there.  <br/>
There are coloring books. There are low-cost games.<br/>
<br/>
Oh -  &quot;Pretty Pretty Princess&quot; is a pretty low-cost game that is SUPER  <br/>
fun. When my girls were little it was generic princesses but now they  <br/>
have a Cinderella version and a Sleeping Beauty version. They are all  <br/>
under 15 dollars.<br/>
<br/>
When I was little I spent a summmer making a whole puppet show of  <br/>
Sleeping Beauty - the Disney version. I made the basic puppets out of  <br/>
socks, but spent a LOT of time putting wings on the fairies and a  <br/>
crown on Sleeping Beauty&#39;s prince - stuff like that. I had my mom read  <br/>
the book and I was the puppet master to act out all the parts with my  <br/>
puppets. Wish we&#39;d had video cameras back then - I&#39;d love to see it now.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of trying to figure out what a child is getting out of  <br/>
anything, take it on faith that their interest indicates that, without  <br/>
a doubt, there is something of value in it for them. Support it. Enjoy  <br/>
it. Expand it. Connect it to other things. Pursue it. Look for ways to  <br/>
explore it more. Take great pleasure in it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1821170524">I was not into princesses, pink, Barbies or anything like that when I was<br/>
little either.  I liked medieval fairy tales, magic, witches, anything like<br/>
that.  My birthday is in October and when I was younger I thought of<br/>
Halloween as my holiday.  So princesses were vague on the interest meter for<br/>
me growing up.<br/>
<br/>
Karl likes such a wide range of things... Justice League, Ben 10, BATMAN!<br/>
(that&#39;s his costume which we already have for trick or treat this<br/>
Halloween), and so forth is the boy end of it.  He also used to think<br/>
absolutely nothing of wearing girly things and putting his hair up in one of<br/>
my hair things.  Not something I expected him to be interested in.  He<br/>
hasn&#39;t been doing that lately.<br/>
<br/>
But he has asked me gazillions of times to read Beauty and the Beast.  He<br/>
gets all soft and sweet about what happens to the Beast and the happy<br/>
ending.  He goes right to sleep.  Maybe he has a great romantic streak.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t know about the movie and had never been much into Disney but Karl<br/>
watches all that kind of thing on youtube.  Today (not Disney but) Care<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1348666609">From the start I want to say that I totally agree with what Pam and others <br/>
have already advised about relishing and supporting your dd&#39;s interest in <br/>
Princesses or anything else.<br/>
<br/>
My dd is a girly girl and loves princesses, Disney and others. It hasn&#39;t <br/>
prevented her from pursuing a wide range of other interests or affected her <br/>
personality in any negative ways.<br/>
<br/>
Disney&#39;s influence on the visual signposting of the classic princess <br/>
characters has resulted in the look of the princesses being largely <br/>
appropriated by other princess doll makers, despite Disney&#39;s strongly <br/>
protectionist attitude to its proprietry characters. This actually makes it <br/>
easier for us to find inexpensive similar enough dolls and stuff.<br/>
<br/>
JCPenney ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/4uav59">http://tinyurl.com/4uav59</a> ) has a surprisingly high quality (and <br/>
we are doll experts around here btw) set of 5 (FIVE!) beautiful (&quot;color <br/>
coded&quot; by costume) princesses, including a Belle, Aurora, Snow White, <br/>
Cinderella and Mermaid for *under* $20 by a Hong Kong based company called <br/>
Chic. Ours arrived within 4 days of our order.<br/>
<br/>
Brass Key continues to make licensed porcelain characters of all the <br/>
princesses from Disney. Costco usually has a bunch of them before the <br/>
holidays that are absolutely beautiful- including some of the &quot;second tier&quot; <br/>
(as I think of them) which are Mulan, Jasmine, Pocahontas, Esmerelda & <br/>
Tinkerbell. These are magnificently detailed with glass eyes and unique face <br/>
molds, saran hair in detailed styles and lavishly embellished costuming. We <br/>
couldn&#39;t believe we were seeing correctly when 3 year old Jayn asked for one <br/>
and we checked the price - $17.95.  For that price she could have her Aurora <br/>
to take on our road trip even if it did get broken. That doll saved us. She <br/>
carried it and played with it for hours every day including in the car. She <br/>
never dropped it until it finally slipped from my fingers some months later <br/>
and the arm cracked. I mended it, and now it sits in the &quot;breakable dolls&quot; <br/>
box with her sisters, who are still treated with much reverence.<br/>
<br/>
All of Jayn&#39;s dolls are to be considered investments in her future. She <br/>
intends to have a doll museum one day, including dolls posed in dioramas and <br/>
backgrounds she fully expects us to make together.<br/>
<br/>
Other princesses include Princess Peach/Toadstool and Princess Daisy from <br/>
the Super Mario Brothers world.<br/>
<br/>
Princess dress up is very easy for us - I have been sewing better and <br/>
cheaper replicas of the Disney princess dresses for years. I wish I had them <br/>
to pass on to you, but they have all made thier way to the Goodwill or other <br/>
neighbors. They will turn up at those thrift stores, as well as on ebay. <br/>
Also if the actual costumes are too expensive some of the Disney princess <br/>
nightgowns are almost as beautiful as the dresses and much cheaper.<br/>
<br/>
We own all the Disney princess movies, because it is totally worth owning <br/>
rather than renting given the number of repeat viewings they all have. We <br/>
are eager to buy the new Tinkerbell movie when it is released soon. But we <br/>
also have a number of other dvd&#39;s of the traditional fairy tales, as well as <br/>
other versions in book form. Jayn has been very interested in comparing the <br/>
different versions.<br/>
<br/>
Barbie has some movies where the character is a Princess too. There is a <br/>
lovely song &quot;To Be a Princess&quot; in &quot;The Princess and the Pauper&quot; which talks <br/>
about the pressures to be unfailingly polite and poised and take <br/>
responsibility for the comfort of others.<br/>
<br/>
Your dd might also like &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot;(Anne Hathaway). Jayn does. Dh <br/>
is working on a movie where his director is the son of the director of those <br/>
movies, who played the security guy Shades in &quot;PD II&quot;. The costume designer <br/>
also did both of those pictures.<br/>

Might be fun to print those pictures out and make a Barbie Princesses  <br/>
of the World photo album or matching game. (Glue each photo on an  <br/>
index card and the name of the country on another card. Turn them face  <br/>
down. Pick two. If they match, keep &#39;em. If they don&#39;t match, turn  <br/>
them back over. Take turns.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-492287427">I loved fairy tales as a child. I would read all the treasure chests of fairy tales from different lands that I could find at the library. My dad bought me this fantastic book of different versions of Sleeping Beauty from around the world. I loved the stories of kindness to strangers being rewarded and injustice being punished. I loved the settings, I loved the stories of someone unassuming becoming princess. There is something wonderful about discovering that magic is just around the corner and that anyone can stumble across a magical doorway. Over time it changed from fairy tales to Narnia and Alice in Wonderland and then it went very distopian, starting with When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit and moving into lots and lots of WWII books at the same time I had a fascination with the Donner party, which may have followed on from Little House on the Prarie. <br/>
<br/>
Linnaea went through a big princess phase. David has never been a royalist and he spent a bit of time showing her pictures of real princesses. I suggested he should include Grace Kelly, even if it was by marriage. Her response was that she didn&#39;t need the princesses to be real to enjoy them. We were in York once when Princess Anne was there and Linnaea and David and my dad went to see her. There was a woman with a Norfolk Terrier waiting to see the Princess as well, Linnaea was more impressed with the dog than with Princess Anne. Her princess phase was fairly brief. She far prefers animal stories to princess stories. But we had a lot of Barbie Princess computer games and she and I would sit together and use magic wands to color Barbie pages and to find magic gems. <br/>

ella has a little playmate who is obsessed with the disney princesse, <br/>
and now ella is obsessed with them too.  while i don&#39;t have anything <br/>
against princesses generally, i&#39;m challenged to learn what this <br/>
particular interest means to ella.  i have never been a huge fan of <br/>
disney, but we haven&#39;t banned them from our home--we just never <br/>
watched the movies until ella&#39;s friend introduced them to her.  what <br/>
do they mean to her?  what does she learn from THESE princesses, as <br/>
opposed to other, more generic princesses?  and how do i explain why <br/>
we can&#39;t buy all these toys and books and costumes and auxillary <br/>
items when this young friend has EVERY. PIECE. OF. DISNEY. PRINCESS. <br/>
MERCHANDISE?<br/>

Maybe you could read fairy tales to her, for the many values they  <br/>
have, and without belaboring the point or turning it into a lesson,  <br/>
she could see how the stories were changed to make movies/cartoon.   <br/>
And that&#39;s not a sin, changing a story so it works better as a film.<br/>
<br/>
In the process,  you might be able to discover wonder in those  <br/>
stories, and understand a little better why anyone would love aspects  <br/>
of them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are no &quot;generic princesses.&quot;  Each one has a story.<br/>

Please try to chill.  I bet the friend is having fun sharing and  <br/>
having someone to appreciate her collection with her. Try not to turn  <br/>
it to something frightening and horrible and threatening.  That will  <br/>
make you the evil queen (see those fairy tales you&#39;re about to start  <br/>

Holly had a Cinderella dress, only what it was was a prom dress or  <br/>

bottom lace off, and that was her veil, her scarf, her tent for  <br/>
Barbie.  (I shortened the straps and pulled them back  together and I  <br/>

her.  I did something, I forget what, to take in the waist.  The goal  <br/>
was to make it something she could put on and take off herself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-679664531">-=-All of Jayn&#39;s dolls are to be considered investments in her  <br/>
future. She<br/>
intends to have a doll museum one day, including dolls posed in  <br/>
dioramas and<br/>
backgrounds she fully expects us to make together.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
There was a doll museum in Albuquerque for a while, with LOTS of  <br/>
Barbies.  Joyce and I went there years ago when she visited, and we  <br/>
would&#39;ve gone back this time, but they&#39;ve moved.  It was a private  <br/>
collection, and I didn&#39;t know the people&#39;s names.<br/>
<br/>
Joyce and I went.  We took Kathryn and Holly, but we&#39;re the ones who  <br/>
really appreciated it.<br/>
<br/>
When I was little, I went once to a doll museum in Santa Fe that was  <br/>
never there again.  It was one room, with glass cases on three  <br/>
sides.  It wasn&#39;t so much diorama as period (60&#39;s museum style), but  <br/>
I still vividly remember some of what they had there, some of which  <br/>
can&#39;t have survived.  Apple-headed dolls from the turn of the  <br/>
century.  Dolls from the American South, from the Civil War.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t even love dolls.  I wasn&#39;t a dolly kind of girl, though my  <br/>
Tiny Tears has had a medical emergency (I suppose it came on slowly,  <br/>
but we discovered it suddenly of late):<br/>

<br/>
Apples don&#39;t last forever.  Neither does rubber.<br/>
<br/>
Holly, on the other hand, at 16, was baby-doll shopping this week and  <br/>
did get a doll yesterday, and named her Clarita.  Perhaps it will be  <br/>
of interest and value for some of you when I say that she gave it to   <br/>
her boyfriend to hold (he&#39;s 24 and was not unschooled) while he was  <br/>
sitting having a World of Warcraft guild meeting (so talking through  <br/>
the computer, but not playing the game) and he held it like the baby  <br/>
it is.<br/>
<br/>
For those new to these ideas, that does not mean that Holly is a  <br/>
little baby playing with dolls. It means Holly is a person who knows  <br/>
her interests and collects what she wants to collect.<br/>
<br/>

owning<br/>
rather than renting given the number of repeat viewings they all  <br/>
have.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Cinderella, widescreen, new edition of the old movie on DVD this  <br/>
week!  I&#39;ve already sent a reminder to my friend Jeff.  Jeff is 34 or  <br/>
so, had no sisters, has two sons and no daughters.  Jeff has never  <br/>
touched a doll in his life.  It&#39;s a game, a quest.  He  hasn&#39;t yet  <br/>
and he doesn&#39;t plan to.  It&#39;s not meanness, it&#39;s just something he  <br/>
started when he was a little boy and  has continued with.   Yet I  <br/>
happen to have known for 20 years now that Cinderella is Jeff&#39;s  <br/>
favorite of all the old Disney cartoons, so I sent him a note to  <br/>
remember to buy one.  His boys won&#39;t know to remind him. :-)<br/>

<br/>
I did too.  I still do.  I read LOTS of fairy tales as a girl and as  <br/>
an adult, and read a fair number to my kids.<br/>
<br/>
One of my favorites is Diamonds and Toads.  It&#39;s a little different  <br/>
sometimes and has different names even, but the central part of the  <br/>
story is this:<br/>
<br/>
Sister and stepsister.  Sister is sent to the well to get water.   <br/>
There is someone there--an ugly old woman, probably.  The person asks  <br/>
for water.  The sister gives her some and is blessed by having  <br/>
diamonds and pearls fall from her mouth when she speaks.  The  <br/>
stepmother is angry and wants HER daughter to have that, so she sends  <br/>
her daughter to the well.  Stepsister botches the whole thing because  <br/>
she&#39;s tacky and rude, and is cursed by having snakes and toads come  <br/>
out of her mouth when she speaks.<br/>
<br/>
Much analysis could ensue.  It can be told very beautifully, and is  <br/>
worth finding for anyone who&#39;s unfamiliar with it.<br/>
<br/>
Ernest Baughman was one of my professors, and he had been a student  <br/>
of Stith Thompson.  Both of them worked on identifying motifs and  <br/>
types, in folk tales.  There are other characters lying in the woods  <br/>
or by wells to test people who pass by there.  In another story it&#39;s  <br/>
an old man sitting by a fire who asks for something (food?) and  <br/>
different characters respond to him differently and receive different  <br/>
gifts.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know the formal name for that category of character, but  <br/>
here&#39;s an introduction to the idea of the motifs.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; week!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I believe that would be &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; that is coming out today, the 60th <br/>
Anniversary special edition. They&#39;ve been promoting the heck out of it on <br/>
Disney Channel. They have four separate filler shows. One is &quot;Movie Surfers&quot; <br/>
for current in the theater movies - that is a great gig - one of the girls <br/>
went to interview Orlando Bloom on the set in the Caribbean for Pirates, <br/>
another guy went to New Zealand for Narnia. One is for promoting the DCOM&#39;s. <br/>
One is Disney 365 for promoting special events at the parks and around, like <br/>
the opening of a new ride or the premier of a new show. One is the Special <br/>
Report that is for news of new stuff coming to DVD, whether theatrical <br/>
releases, dcoms, compilations of shows, or classic reissues. Lots of <br/>
different styles, lots of opportunities for young actors/aspiring reporters <br/>
to work.<br/>
<br/>
We have the last version of Sleeping Beauty, which was two disc. I expect <br/>
that they are including much of the same historical material. It&#39;s really <br/>
interesting to see how the art work developed, and the conciousness with <br/>
which all the artists worked up the particular different (at the time) style <br/>
of the figures and backgrounds. Also how they had a ballerina dance the <br/>
steps for the animators. They still do that kind of thing today, only <br/>
nowadays the dancers wear motion capture suits and put the movements <br/>
directly into the computer.<br/>
<br/>
The vocalist for Briar Rose/Aurora was chosen because they felt she had an <br/>
ability to slip from her nice speaking voice into singing operatically <br/>
seamlessly.<br/>
<br/>
Disney has a Maleficent doll at the main store. Jayn was so excited to get <br/>
her for one of her birthdays, 5 I think, that she refused to allow me to buy <br/>
it for her when we were at Disneyland two weeks before her birthday <br/>
serendipitously. She told everyone she was getting a Maleficent doll. So <br/>
many blank faces - she had to add &quot;from Sleeping Beauty&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The great thing about DVD&#39;s is how much Jayn enjoys the special features and <br/>
making of stuff.<br/>
<br/>
The actress in &quot;Enchanted&quot; looks like my mom in her late twenties/early <br/>
thirties. The doll of her - the one from the real part, not the animated <br/>
doll - looks even more like her. Bizarre. The Patrick Dempsey doll is a <br/>
great likeness of him too. We have him dressed up as a prince from the <br/>
finale of the movie.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not parody. It&#39;s homage!<br/>

classical characters like the ones grimms wrote about-and my<br/>
relationship with them was &quot;professional&quot;, not personal. :D-=-<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
The Grimms collected those stories.  They didn&#39;t &quot;write&quot; them.   <br/>
They&#39;re traditional among Europeans, and they collected in Germany,  <br/>
mostly.<br/>
<br/>
The Disney Princesses are 20th century versions of medieval stories.   <br/>
They&#39;re the same princesses.<br/>
<br/>
Those stories are have been told and retold for hundreds of years.<br/>

the 60th<br/>
Anniversary special edition. They&#39;ve been promoting the heck out of  <br/>
it on<br/>
Disney Channel.-=<br/>

Ooops.  Bummer.   Well, still cool.<br/>

Holly and I were at KayBee toys this afternoon buying six toys for  <br/>
Keith and Marty&#39;s donations for some upcoming Toys For Tots things  <br/>
(the SCA here collects lots of toys, and the Marines pick them up in  <br/>
an odd formal moment of uniformed marines and SCA guys in armor)...   <br/>
But anyway, there were Disney Princess things and dresses for girls  <br/>
around six years old, give or take, for $20.  Pretty nice ones.  And  <br/>
there were shoes galore, and some Tinkerbell shoes *I* wanted in my  <br/>
size, and not very expensive.  On sale through Monday/Columbus Day  <br/>
(apologies to non-Americans or those with no KayBee toys).<br/>

<br/>
Once a question is out on the list, though, it&#39;s anyone&#39;s to discuss.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been a rough couple of weeks on the list, and in my life too,  <br/>
unfortunately, or I would have a page of suggestions to send you  <br/>
about how to make best use of this (or any list).<br/>
<br/>
Joyce once wrote, of this list:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The list is about ideas, not about people.<br/>
Think of ideas like balls and the list like a ball court. If someone  <br/>
tosses an idea worth discussing into the court it&#39;s going to get  <br/>
batted about. At that point what&#39;s going on is no longer about the  <br/>
person who tossed the idea in. It&#39;s about the idea and how well and  <br/>
cleanly it&#39;s being tossed about. (Unless the tosser keeps jumping in  <br/>
and grabbing the idea ball saying &quot;Mine!&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Joyce<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s on this page, which is about the  <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:UnschoolignDiscussion@...">UnschoolignDiscussion@...</a> list, but much of it is true  <br/>
of this list too (except the two-week waiting period).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1113290627">There is a fairly large doll museum in the greater Seattle area:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dollart.com/">http://www.dollart.com/</a>  Just thought I would mention it in case<br/>
anyone was in the Seattle area after Life is Good (or for any other<br/>
reason).<br/>
<br/>
I like dolls but I wasn&#39;t interested in collecting them as a child.  I<br/>
ran across this doll artist when I was looking for a big doll for my<br/>
daughter and I wanted to start collecting dolls.  I like some more<br/>
than others, but they are amazing:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.annettehimstedt.com/index_en.php">http://www.annettehimstedt.com/index_en.php</a>  (and yes, the first time<br/>
I find a doll I really want just for the sake of looking at it, they<br/>
run about $1000 each).<br/>

&gt; There was a doll museum in Albuquerque for a while, with LOTS of<br/>
&gt; Barbies. Joyce and I went there years ago when she visited, and we<br/>
&gt; would&#39;ve gone back this time, but they&#39;ve moved. It was a private<br/>
&gt; collection, and I didn&#39;t know the people&#39;s names.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Joyce and I went. We took Kathryn and Holly, but we&#39;re the ones who<br/>
&gt; really appreciated it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When I was little, I went once to a doll museum in Santa Fe that was<br/>
&gt; never there again. It was one room, with glass cases on three<br/>
&gt; sides. It wasn&#39;t so much diorama as period (60&#39;s museum style), but<br/>
&gt; I still vividly remember some of what they had there, some of which<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t have survived. Apple-headed dolls from the turn of the<br/>
&gt; century. Dolls from the American South, from the Civil War. </span></blockquote></div>
