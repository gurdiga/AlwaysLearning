<div id="ygrps-yiv-1946343286">Julian has this wonderful curly hair that we justy never seem to get around <br/>
to getting cut often. For many years he&#39;d ALWAYS be mistaken for a girl, but <br/>
I was terribly impressed that he never seemed to care. Sometimes he&#39;d <br/>
casually say, &quot;Actually, I&#39;m a boy,&quot; which would send the person into fits of <br/>
embarassment. Julian never considered it an insult though.<br/>
<br/>
Once he hit puberty, even with the hair, he was never mistaken for a girl. He <br/>
just the opther day got his haior cut, and for the first time said I could <br/>
wait in the waiting area rather than come over with him. He usually doesn&#39;t <br/>
want his hair cut too short, because he likes his curls. Well, the <br/>
hairdresser talked him into this short cut which looks lovely, but it wasn&#39;t <br/>
HIM. His hair has NEVER been this short. He was quite uncomfortable with it <br/>
at first, but he&#39;s okay. He&#39;s going to let it grow again though.<br/>
