<div id="ygrps-yiv-1551144544">Julia who is 7 is so happy to be home schooled because she missed me so much.  In fact she and Jonah are back in my bed after finally getting out!!!  :-(  She does beautifully in school, loves to read and especially loves to write stories.  She keeps asking what she is going to do for schoolwork.  <br/>
<br/>
This morning I told her that the only thing she has to do each day is to keep a journal and read.  I told her she can write anything she wants and she can decorate the book anyway she likes.  I asked her what she would like to read and she replied that she will read what she writes!!<br/>

I bet compared to what you were doing before this sounds like the  <br/>
epitome of freedom, but it&#39;s still requirement, assignment and  <br/>
schoolwork.  It still shows that you the mom aren&#39;t yet aware of the  <br/>
problems of &quot;requiring&quot; something like reading.<br/>

<br/>
Each of my kids are avid readers like their mom.  Julia and Jonah each had tutoring in school until they were dependent.  I participated and know the skills they used to get them there.  Reading with Julia can be books of her choice. We can read together (which she loves) or independently.  Her older sibs can also read to her and with her. I usually dont let Jonah on runescape until his reading is done, but remember we are newly homeschooling and I need to get organized here.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra I am so grateful for all of your work and all the info available to me here on the net.  It makes our transformation so much easier.  I feel so much support.  I used the proposed curfriculum on your unschooling site for each of my kids, I just edited it to their needs.  Thank you so much.<br/>

  Or you could declare early summer vacation -- okay, early spring vacation &lt;g&gt; -- and just let the kids de-school completely while you &#39;get organized.&#39;  I bet you&#39;ll find it much less effort to &#39;organize&#39; your life as unschoolers than trying to set/keep up with any level of assigned school at home work.  <br/>

I have read to my daughter Emily, who just turned 5 yrs old, since the<br/>

she can&#39;t really read all the book for herself)...she would love it if<br/>
I could read to her all day...she is always asking me to read to<br/>
her...Emily and Dad read at night before bedtime so there is no<br/>
trouble here...she loves the time she gets to have uninterupted with<br/>
each of us....it is a good quiet time tool...so I think is it is a<br/>
part of the daily routine it&#39;s just a part of the day...no set time,<br/>
just play it by ear...It&#39;s just my opintion....Take it as you like.<br/>
