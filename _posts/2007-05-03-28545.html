<div id="ygrps-yiv-496386398">Several years ago I watched a program on TV (!)---probably the History <br/>
Channel, but could have been A&E---about the world&#39;s greatest <br/>
inventions. One hundred of them. The countdown was pretty cool, and I <br/>
was glued to the TV. I mean---the top 100 of ALL the inventions *ever*? <br/>
The wheel was lower than you&#39;d think---and I can&#39;t remember whether <br/>
sliced bread made the list at all! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Anyway, the big winner was the press by Gutenberg. It brought books to <br/>
the masses. Pretty impressive.<br/>
<br/>
  And although I understand the importance of the printing press in <br/>
history, I was just thinking about the two biggest inventions in *OUR* <br/>
LIVES. The TV and computer have opened up our lives so much I can&#39;t <br/>
imagine life without them any more.<br/>
<br/>
  Books were really the only option even when *I* was a child (TV was <br/>
B&W and wowed me with I Love Lucy, Captain Kangaroo, and What&#39;s My <br/>
Line?)---and definitely the only option when my parents were kids <br/>
(well, I guess they did have radio). But TV was so limited that books <br/>
were how you found out about the world. Books and magazines (and there <br/>
weren&#39;t all *that* many magazines---not like now!). Books could take to <br/>
to another world--even if you had to make up the &quot;view&quot;---I mean the <br/>
author had to be damned descriptive to accurately &quot;paint&quot; the Serengeti <br/>
or the Alps or that silly and amazingly beautiful bird and his mating <br/>
dance on The Planet&#39;s Rainforest episode. ANd how many times have you <br/>
pictured someone or something so completely different than what the <br/>
author wrote? Only to find out later how wrong you were?<br/>
<br/>
  I can&#39;t imagine life without the incredible array of TV shows we have <br/>
now. People seem to bitch loudest about Ed, Edd, & Eddy and the latest <br/>
soon-to-be-nixed sit-com and the so-called &quot;reality shows&quot;---but <br/>
tossing out the TV also tosses out all the GOOD programming out there. <br/>
Why would you want to do THAT? Just turn the flippin&#39; channel!<br/>
<br/>
The computer has opened our worlds even further. The *instant* access <br/>
to everything printed (is anything not at our fingertips?) as well as <br/>
photos and film clips and interviews and....And then there&#39;s the <br/>
instant communication---I&#39;m still amazed that I can just type someone&#39;s <br/>
name in...and THERE they are: really and truly in living color! &lt;g&gt; And <br/>
yet there are still folks who *choose* not to have a <br/>
computer---incredible!<br/>
<br/>
  The telephone would have to way up there too----and how many of us <br/>
 from the 50s & 60s actually believed we&#39;d have The Jetson&#39;s phone <br/>
(Skype) or Captain Kirk&#39;s communicator (cell)??? But as cool as the <br/>
phone is, I&#39;m more likely to IM a friend than I am to pick up the <br/>
phone!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Back to the point. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
WHY would you want to deprive your child or yourself of something so <br/>
remarkably rich?<br/>
<br/>
HOW can something so amazingly informative and beautiful and enriching <br/>
be bad for you?<br/>
<br/>
HOW can a *box* be addictive or dangerous or powerful? Who has the <br/>
control here? Seriously?<br/>

shows...dd and I love shows about people and have had deep and insightful<br/>
discussions about people&#39;s actions and choices, why they do what they do,<br/>
etc.  Much better fodder than probably would ever have come from seeing the<br/>
people that we do in our daily lives. After all, we don&#39;t live in the inner<br/>
city, aren&#39;t in position to date many people at once, and have never met<br/>
anyone like Flava Flav or New York! After seeing some different reality<br/>
shows, I think dd has already decided things she WON&#39;T do without ever<br/>
having to have had the experience herself.<br/>
<br/>
Discussions with my sons about these shows tend to be about the actual<br/>
production of the show...what was set up and what was real, what were the<br/>
intentions of the producers, camera angle choices, editing choices, etc.<br/>
They tend to be quite cynical about reality shows...they believe there is<br/>
major manipulation involved and don&#39;t usually go much further. They tend to<br/>
be drawn to documentaries (History Channel, Nature/Animal channels),<br/>
fiction/science fiction/fantasy, and comedy (Ed, Edd, and Eddy included :o).<br/>
<br/>
6 people in this house, TV is unlimited, and it is on, on average, 1-2 hours<br/>
a day. Some days it isn&#39;t on at all. Sometimes it isn&#39;t on for many days.<br/>
Some days its on much of the day, like if there is a marathon of a favorite<br/>
show, or someone is sick, or there is a build-up of recorded favs.<br/>

<br/>
Voila, that&#39;s real *learning.*<br/>
<br/>
Education is done to someone by someone else.<br/>
<br/>
Learning happens inside the learner as brain connections are made and  <br/>
things are accepted or rejected as better or worse, more useful or  <br/>
less useful.<br/>
<br/>
Voila means &quot;look at that!&quot;<br/>
It is like the lightbulb of a learning moment.<br/>
<br/>
In French it has a backward accent on the &quot;a&quot; but it&#39;s used in  <br/>
English without it.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a song Raffi sings that has, in every verse, &quot;Well looky,  <br/>
looky, looky!  Y&#39;know what fell out?...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Lookee&quot; is used in English in an informal, little-kid way, but it&#39;s  <br/>
left over from &quot;look ye&quot;  (which means &quot;look, you-to-whom-I&#39;m- <br/>
speaking&quot;).  &quot;Ye&quot; is the informal, and the formal is &quot;you.&quot;  In  <br/>
Shakespeare&#39;s Henry V, Fluellen says &quot;look you&quot; in several of his  <br/>
speeches.  Maybe it was regional at that time, but it&#39;s used as a  <br/>
kind of &quot;you know&quot; amplifying statement, &quot;you know&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Everything&#39;s connected.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-182890063">I would answer that technology is not neutral, and every technology,<br/>
especially disruptive ones like the printing press, television and computers<br/>
brings unforseen consequences.  As Neil Postman mentions in &quot;Informing<br/>
Ourselves to Death&quot; (link below), when the printing press was invented, the<br/>
hope was that it would help to spread the Christian faith.  In fact it took<br/>
power away from the church, as people could go right to the source, and led<br/>
to the Reformation.<br/>
<br/>
When I think about the dangers of television, I think about the surveys<br/>
which showed that people who got most of their news from TV tended to be<br/>
less informed than people who got their news from other sources.  Even<br/>
worse, those same people tended to be more supportive of the Iraq invasion<br/>
and more likely to believe that there was a link between Al Qaeda and Saddam<br/>
Hussein.<br/>

&quot;The Medieval order&quot; would mean what, then?   There were many  <br/>
cultures in many states of rest and unrest.  Do you mean it gave a  <br/>
means of advancement to people who should&#39;ve stayed lower class?<br/>
<br/>
As to the church, there were things printed by and for the Catholic  <br/>
Church that they appreciated having available.  They were having a  <br/>
hard time with unity within &quot;the church&quot; --  it looked very different  <br/>
in Iceland than it did in Spain or Germany already.   Our  <br/>

<br/>
&quot;Peril&quot; is just too dramatic a concept for me.<br/>
<br/>
By &quot;ignore&quot; do you mean it&#39;s better to ignore TV?  That prevents peril?<br/>
Or to pay close attention to the perilous potential of TV?  That  <br/>
would be a waste of a life.<br/>
<br/>
I owned and gave away a book that analyzed rock lyrics in gory detail  <br/>
to prove they were anti-Christian, satanic, evil.  MUCH detail.  The  <br/>
guy who wrote that was sure he was being Godly, but what he did was  <br/>
to dedicate his life to wallowing in the worst of rock lyrics.  There  <br/>
went his 60-however-many-years on earth, stuck in heavy metal lyrics.<br/>
<br/>
Everything has a positive or negative effect on someone, and nothing  <br/>
has a positive or negative effect on EVERYone, so do you have an  <br/>
example of something that IS neutral?<br/>
Do you have an example of something that&#39;s not perilous?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>All the more reason to be involved in our kids lives - including <br/>
watching tv and playing computer games *with* them. Many many <br/>
unschoolers can attest to having thoughtful, critical conversations <br/>
about the content of various tv shows and &lt;gasp&gt; advertisements with <br/>
their kids. My partner and 13yo stepson regularly talk about the <br/>
inherent biases of comedy shows, for example, while I tend to have <br/>
conversations with him about computer games.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;unforseen consequences.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We&#39;ve had some really interesting &quot;unforseen consequences&quot; in our <br/>
home, since we got a satellite dish almost six months ago. My 5yo <br/>
went from a kid who liked to draw to someone passionate about <br/>
cartoons - as in drawing them. She has studied cartoon after cartoon <br/>
for details of how to draw forms, action, and emotion in different <br/>
ways, different styles. Its been pretty spectacular. <br/>
<br/>
My stepson, who&#39;s been here about the same amount of time as the <br/>
dish, is more interested in computer games, for the most part. He <br/>
left school saying he never wanted to read again, but as <br/>
an &quot;unforseen consequence&quot; of his online gaming, has started <br/>
exploring different languages and doing some private research about <br/>
Ireland. Amazing. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My experience is that people who are interested in current events <br/>
spend time gathering information from a variety of sources, rather <br/>
than relying on a single source - did the surveys in question <br/>
control for that? Its hardly surprising that people who aren&#39;t very <br/>
interested in a subject don&#39;t know a whole lot about that subject. <br/>
That doesn&#39;t say anything at all about tv, but it may say something <br/>
about the less-than-neutral nature of surveys.<br/>

the printing press was an obscure theory, or a matter of dispute. <br/>
I&#39;ve read it in the Neil Postman article that I cited previously, as<br/>
well as in Marshall McLuhan&#39;s _Understanding Media_.  Here&#39;s a quote<br/>
from the article I linked to earlier:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
Gutenberg thought his invention would<br/>
advance the cause of the Holy Roman See, whereas in fact, it turned<br/>
out to bring a revolution which destroyed the monopoly of the Church.<br/>
&lt;/snip&gt;<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.mat.upm.es/~jcm/postman-informing.html">http://www.mat.upm.es/~jcm/postman-informing.html</a><br/>
<br/>
What do you think of Postman&#39;s discussion of the unintended effects of<br/>
new technologies on society?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; -=-&gt; &quot;Neutral&quot; as opposed to what?<br/>

&gt; technologies have unforseen consequences that we ignore at our peril.  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Peril&quot; is just too dramatic a concept for me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; By &quot;ignore&quot; do you mean it&#39;s better to ignore TV?  That prevents peril?<br/>
&gt; Or to pay close attention to the perilous potential of TV?  That  <br/>
&gt; would be a waste of a life.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I like TV, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a waste of life to be vigilant<br/>
against the damaging potential of any technology.  In response to<br/>
Kelly&#39;s statement about TV:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
HOW can something so amazingly informative and beautiful and enriching<br/>
be bad for you?<br/>
&lt;/snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say: Sure, there is much that is informative and beautiful on TV,<br/>
but there&#39;s also lots manipulative crap too.  Everybody&#39;s vulnerable,<br/>
not just kids.  That&#39;s why so much money is spent on advertising and<br/>
creating the images that we see.<br/>
<br/>
Just to try to bring this back around to Learning, I&#39;ll say that the<br/>
kind of engagement we have with the spoken word is different than the<br/>
kind we have with the written word, which is different than the kind<br/>
we have with the moving picture.  Even the way we engage with TV<br/>
is different than the way we engage with movie on the screen.  We<br/>
process each media differently: TV involves us more emotionally,<br/>
whereas the printed word requires more concentration.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my takeaway from McLuhan&#39;s Understanding Media.  What do you think?</div>

If you put your ear to your computer screen, you might be able to <br/>
hear my applause coming to you all the way from sunny Canberra.<br/>

Although, I used to be a Luddite and now I&#39;m not, and you know what <br/>

<br/>
In any event, last time I looked, all TVs come with both a means of <br/>
changing from a programme you don&#39;t like to one you do and - if you <br/>
can&#39;t find something you like - a button you can press to switch it <br/>
off. If those things were absent, I might be more receptive to the <br/>
idea that this is technology that isn&#39;t neutral, but it seems to me <br/>
they&#39;re standard components.<br/>

&gt; &gt;unforseen consequences.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We&#39;ve had some really interesting &quot;unforseen consequences&quot; in our <br/>
&gt; home, since we got a satellite dish almost six months ago. My 5yo <br/>
&gt; went from a kid who liked to draw to someone passionate about <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; My stepson, who&#39;s been here about the same amount of time as the <br/>

&gt; left school saying he never wanted to read again, but as <br/>
&gt; an &quot;unforseen consequence&quot; of his online gaming, has started <br/>

&gt; My experience is that people who are interested in current events <br/>
&gt; spend time gathering information from a variety of sources, rather <br/>
&gt; than relying on a single source - did the surveys in question <br/>
&gt; control for that? Its hardly surprising that people who aren&#39;t very <br/>
&gt; interested in a subject don&#39;t know a whole lot about that subject. <br/>
&gt; That doesn&#39;t say anything at all about tv, but it may say something <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My kids aren&#39;t that vulnerable to television. There are occasionally things <br/>
that they see advertised that appeal to them, and last night, watching <br/>
Lizzie McGuire, Linnaea wanted me to brush her hair. But, on the whole they <br/>
aren&#39;t that vulnerable. Probably much less to do with television and much <br/>
more to do with themselves. If I view the television and its advertising as <br/>
predatory, surely it is much better if I help my children, the prey items, <br/>
to be stronger in themselves and less likely to be easy prey then if I only <br/>
delay their association with television until they are no longer under my <br/>
&quot;watchful eye&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I think that there are ways that people can be vulnerable to the influences <br/>
of others. But I don&#39;t believe that by opening the world up and exploring <br/>
its rich wonderfulness and supporting your children in experiencing the joys <br/>
that are possible will you be likely to increase their vulnerability. I <br/>
don&#39;t believe that by saying yes to your children&#39;s dreams and desires you <br/>
will produce children who are needy enough to believe that whatever <br/>
advertised product will make them more complete or a better person. I do <br/>
believe that you can imbue objects with greater power by demonizing them, by <br/>
separating them, by saying to others that they aren&#39;t powerful enough to <br/>
withstand whatever that object contains. I do believe that anything can go <br/>
from the mundane to the sacred simply by limiting or denying access to that <br/>
thing from pomegranate seeds or apples to television to a candy bar to a <br/>
packet of chips. I know a boy who can&#39;t wait until he is grown so that he <br/>
can eat meat and stay up late. Meat and late nights are his coming of age <br/>
rights. And so the morality based vegetarianism may be lost on him, because <br/>
meat is not murder, it is an adult privilege. It isn&#39;t his morality, it is <br/>
his mother&#39;s. Just as shopping at Walmart or eating at McDonalds or watching <br/>
Ed, Edd and Eddy might be for the children of somebody who is boycotting any <br/>
of those things and making their children boycott them as well. Whether or <br/>
not boycotting those things is an ethical thing, if the boycott isn&#39;t your <br/>
choice...<br/>
<br/>
The television has been on for much of the morning. It often is on for most <br/>
of the day. Simon and Linnaea seem to enjoy the noise. They aren&#39;t watching <br/>
it. They are finding magical rings that give them certain powers over the <br/>
universe and Simon is hunting deer and wolves for him to eat or salt or <br/>
smoke after Linnaea skins them. Linnaea is gathering plants and nuts and <br/>
berries, she&#39;s a vegetarian, so won&#39;t eat the meat, but she is alright with <br/>
using the skins to make clothes. Sometimes, in a lull of the movement and <br/>
the storytelling, they will stop and watch something. Just now it sparked a <br/>
conversation about being &quot;book smart&quot; versus other kinds of smart, a <br/>
carryover of a conversation from last night. And, since this e-mail has <br/>
taken me much of 4 hours to write, Simon has been practicing juggling and <br/>
exploring some of a fingerprinting kit and Linnaea has made a few potions <br/>
while sitting in the same room as the television. An active life is occuring <br/>
with the television on, whatever &quot;peril&quot; that may be lurking, it isn&#39;t <br/>
darkening our day.<br/>

<br/>
You can say that, but it doesn&#39;t make it true.  Different people take  <br/>

and music, and the surroundings.  Outside, is it overcast and windy,  <br/>
or sunny?  Inside, is it clean and decluttered, or is it dark and  <br/>
jumbly?  Those surroundings are often described, in novels, for  <br/>
effect.  So are facial expressions.  Some people picture them clearly  <br/>

You said it destroyed their monopoly.<br/>
I was saying they had fractionalization and localization before  <br/>

But what you were really saying was that technology is dangerous and  <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not worth discussing, as it&#39;s not unschooling and it wasn&#39;t  <br/>
something you yourself experienced.  If you want to debate history,  <br/>
go to a history forum, or an anti-technology list.  If you want to  <br/>
participate on this list, write about unschooling at your house, and  <br/>
how your kids are learning, and how your life is.<br/>

<br/>
If they&#39;re not about unschooling, they&#39;re inappropriate for this  <br/>
list.  If they ARE about unschooling, then  it helps others have more  <br/>
data about unschooling.  The observations of others about your  <br/>
experiences, and the observation BY others of your experience is  <br/>
informative, and it&#39;s a kind of research, too.  It&#39;s a learning  <br/>
opportunity for all concerned when unschoolers share their  <br/>
experiences with other unschoolers, just the same as when those who  <br/>
restore 50&#39;s Chevy trucks share their experiences with others who  <br/>
have and work on the same kinds of trucks.<br/>

This discussion might be going nowhere in your mind, but on the  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-611804534">I used to be a Marshall McLuhan fan - many years ago. But I now think  <br/>
that he pulled much of his philosophy out of thin air - and it just  <br/>
isn&#39;t the same air that I&#39;m breathing these days. Neil Postman is a  <br/>
great read, but he really is not talking about unschoolers - he is  <br/>
absolutely focused on the lives of schooled kids.<br/>
<br/>
Our ideas are truly just as valid, more so if we&#39;re talking about  <br/>
unschooling families, because McLuhan absolutely never met a single  <br/>
unschooling family, I&#39;m sure. He never knew kids who grew up with all  <br/>
the technology and without parental fear of the technology.<br/>
<br/>
When someone goes on a scared rant about the evils of tv and video  <br/>
games and the internet, etc., &quot;we&quot; know for sure that they aren&#39;t  <br/>
truly aware of the possibilities inherent in an unschooling lifestyle  <br/>
- we know for sure that they don&#39;t understand what a difference in  <br/>
parent/child relationships there is between even the nicest  <br/>
conventional parents and radical unschoolers. We know that tv- <br/>
watching and viddeo game playing are not hurting our children - we  <br/>
know these as facts in the same way we know water is wet and sunshine  <br/>
is warm - we know it with an absolute certainty because we are living  <br/>
it, it is our own experience and the real life experience of hundreds  <br/>
of other families we know.<br/>

<br/>
I think we *should* trust our own observations. But we shouldn&#39;t stop  <br/>
there. We *should* think clearly and objectively about what we  <br/>
observe. Turn it around and upside down and look at it from all angles.<br/>
<br/>
Is it some rare gift to be able to try to objectively assess the  <br/>
cause and effect of what we see, to test out theories we come to  <br/>
against a larger pool of data? To think critically?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think so. I think schools do a good job of discouraging  <br/>
people from exercising those muscles. They train people to look at  <br/>
what experts see first and fit their interpretation of their own  <br/>
observations to the experts. (How many people judged the validity of  <br/>
a science experiment in school based on the result they *should* get?  <br/>
Well, yeah, the experiments were set up that way: to lead us to the  <br/>
right answer. So were math problems. So were the conclusions we were  <br/>
supposed to draw from Silas Marner.)<br/>

<br/>
 I know some people who are so fearful of this stuff.Their lives are really, really  stressed out by it as they struggle to work out how to unschool around these fears. To me, fear and unschooling simply don&#39;t mesh. Where there&#39;s fear there&#39;s control. Where there&#39;s control there&#39;s children without freedom.<br/>
<br/>
Water, sun (as Sandra mentioned)...air, rain, wind, fire all natural occuring things....all have killing/damaging capacity. Having information about how to live with these things and enjoy them has got to be the thing our children need. Enjoying water and sun and computers and TV and books and paint and sleep and food and.....life with our children has got to be a joyful existance. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s certainly one we are enjoying (mostly now free from techno fear)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Scientists have not identified specific health effects resulting  <br/>
&gt; from exposure to extremely low doses of low-level radiation over  <br/>
&gt; prolonged periods of time. However, the current assumption is that  <br/>
&gt; there is no threshold of exposure below which x-radiation may not  <br/>
&gt; adversely effect human health. It is advisable, therefore, that x- <br/>
&gt; radiation from TV sets, as well as other commonly used electronic  <br/>
&gt; products, be kept as low as reasonably achievable. It was for this  <br/>
&gt; purpose that Congress enacted the Radiation Control for Health and  <br/>
&gt; Safety Act of 1968 (currently called Federal Food, Drug, and  <br/>
&gt; Cosmetic Act � Subchapter C � Electronic Product Radiation Control).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It should be emphasized that most TV sets have not been found to  <br/>
&gt; give off any measurable level of radiation, and there is no  <br/>
&gt; evidence that radiation from TV sets has resulted in human injury.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Setting a Radiation Safety Standard<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has the responsibility for  <br/>
&gt; carrying out an electronic product radiation control program  <br/>
&gt; mandated by the Electronic Product Radiation Control provisions of  <br/>
&gt; the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. Through it&#39;s Center for Devices and  <br/>
&gt; Radiological Health, FDA sets and enforces standards of performance  <br/>
&gt; for electronic products to assure that radiation emissions do not  <br/>
&gt; pose a hazard to public health.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A Federal standard limiting x-ray emissions from TV receivers to  <br/>
&gt; 0.5 milliroentgen per hour (mR/hr) was issued on December 25, 1969.  <br/>
&gt; The standard is applicable to all TV sets manufactured after  <br/>
&gt; January 15, 1970. The overall effect of the standard is to require  <br/>
&gt; that TV receivers must not emit x-radiation above the 0.5 mR/hr  <br/>
&gt; level when tested under adverse operating conditions. Test  <br/>
&gt; conditions do not represent normal use and ensure that when used  <br/>
&gt; under normal conditions, TV sets do not pose a radiation hazard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Assuring That TV Sets Meet the Radiation Standard<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Manufacturers of television receivers and computer monitors contain  <br/>
&gt; CRTs must certify that their products meets performance standard  <br/>
&gt; under Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part  <br/>
&gt; 1020.10. All TV manufacturers must submit written radiation safety  <br/>
&gt; reports to FDA outlining how they assure that each set coming off  <br/>
&gt; the assembly line complies with the Federal x-ray radiation limit.  <br/>
&gt; These reports contain a description of the manufacturer�s quality  <br/>
&gt; control and testing program and the television radiation safety  <br/>
&gt; design. Manufacturers also must maintain records of test data and  <br/>
&gt; prepare an annual report to FDA summarizing these records. The FDA  <br/>
&gt; has the authority to ask for radiation safety data including  <br/>
&gt; results of x-ray leakage from selected sets to determine compliance  <br/>
&gt; with the standard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Television receivers imported into the United States, which do not  <br/>
&gt; meet the standard are not allowed into the country and are  <br/>
&gt; destroyed if not exported in 90 days. Importers, however, may  <br/>
&gt; petition FDA for permission to correct the violations.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How Safe Are TV Sets Today?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; X-radiation emissions from properly operated TV sets and computer  <br/>
&gt; monitors containing CRTs are well controlled and do not present a  <br/>
&gt; public health hazard. The FDA standard, and today�s technology,  <br/>
&gt; such as electronic hold-down safety circuits and regulated power  <br/>
&gt; supplies, have effectively eliminated the risk of x-radiation from  <br/>
&gt; these products. FDA has not found TVs that violate the standard  <br/>
&gt; under normal (home) use conditions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It is important to note also that flat panel TVs incorporating  <br/>
&gt; Liquid Crystal Displays (LCD) or Plasma displays are not capable of  <br/>
&gt; emitting x-radiation. As such these products and are not subject to  <br/>
&gt; the FDA standard and do not pose a public health hazard.<br/>

&gt;&gt; 0.5 milliroentgen per hour (mR/hr) was issued on December 25, 1969.<br/>
&gt;&gt; The standard is applicable to all TV sets manufactured after<br/>
&gt;&gt; January 15, 1970. The overall effect of the standard is to require<br/>
&gt;&gt; that TV receivers must not emit x-radiation above the 0.5 mR/hr<br/>
&gt;&gt; level when tested under adverse operating conditions. Test<br/>
&gt;&gt; conditions do not represent normal use and ensure that when used<br/>
&gt;&gt; under normal conditions, TV sets do not pose a radiation hazard.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Assuring That TV Sets Meet the Radiation Standard<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Manufacturers of television receivers and computer monitors contain<br/>
&gt;&gt; CRTs must certify that their products meets performance standard<br/>
&gt;&gt; under Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part<br/>
&gt;&gt; 1020.10. All TV manufacturers must submit written radiation safety<br/>
&gt;&gt; reports to FDA outlining how they assure that each set coming off<br/>
&gt;&gt; the assembly line complies with the Federal x-ray radiation limit.<br/>
&gt;&gt; These reports contain a description of the manufacturer&#39;s quality<br/>
&gt;&gt; control and testing program and the television radiation safety<br/>
&gt;&gt; design. Manufacturers also must maintain records of test data and<br/>
&gt;&gt; prepare an annual report to FDA summarizing these records. The FDA<br/>
&gt;&gt; has the authority to ask for radiation safety data including<br/>
&gt;&gt; results of x-ray leakage from selected sets to determine compliance<br/>
&gt;&gt; with the standard.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Television receivers imported into the United States, which do not<br/>
&gt;&gt; meet the standard are not allowed into the country and are<br/>
&gt;&gt; destroyed if not exported in 90 days. Importers, however, may<br/>
&gt;&gt; petition FDA for permission to correct the violations.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; How Safe Are TV Sets Today?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; X-radiation emissions from properly operated TV sets and computer<br/>
&gt;&gt; monitors containing CRTs are well controlled and do not present a<br/>
&gt;&gt; public health hazard. The FDA standard, and today&#39;s technology,<br/>
&gt;&gt; such as electronic hold-down safety circuits and regulated power<br/>
&gt;&gt; supplies, have effectively eliminated the risk of x-radiation from<br/>
&gt;&gt; these products. FDA has not found TVs that violate the standard<br/>
&gt;&gt; under normal (home) use conditions.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; It is important to note also that flat panel TVs incorporating<br/>
&gt;&gt; Liquid Crystal Displays (LCD) or Plasma displays are not capable of<br/>
&gt;&gt; emitting x-radiation. As such these products and are not subject to<br/>
&gt;&gt; the FDA standard and do not pose a public health hazard.<br/>
