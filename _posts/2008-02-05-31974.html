<div id="ygrps-yiv-205467251">Time to recruit more members for my Grandparent Yahoo Group, GRANDleap<br/>
(Learn-Explore-Adventure-Play)  We presently have 54 members (two of whom<br/>
are Granddads) since its August 22nd  inception. So please ask your parents,<br/>
friends and relatives if they would like to take the GRAND LEAP and hop on<br/>
board our UNschooling adventure.  It doesn&#39;t matter where they are in their<br/>
thinking or where they are in the world. We are all here to support each<br/>
other. Here&#39;s the link, thanks!   &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/GrandLEAP">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/GrandLEAP</a>&gt;<br/>
