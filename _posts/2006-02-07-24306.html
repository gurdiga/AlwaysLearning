<div id="ygrps-yiv-1191082223">Hey!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be over it in ten or twelve minutes, but I&#39;m grumpy  <br/>
with anyone who knew that <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://unschooling.info/forum">http://unschooling.info/forum</a> was  <br/>
operational again and didn&#39;t tell me!  For the first several days it  <br/>
was down I checked six or ten times a day, and finally my behavior  <br/>
was extinguished (in operant conditioning terms), but I waited for a  <br/>
sign from above.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been up since the 2nd!?<br/>
I wasn&#39;t invited!?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
