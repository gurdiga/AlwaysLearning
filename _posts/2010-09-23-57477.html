You could make a folder within the forum and call it &quot;politics&quot; or  <br/>
&quot;the wider world&quot; or something and when they get on those topics, ask  <br/>

Maybe.<br/>
Or you could just do what I do here and ask them to take that to a  <br/>

I always feel difficult to encourage such discussions on a<br/>
unschooling, parenting, homeschooling forum.  I face a block here<br/>
since even though in my younger days I have been a journalist and<br/>
reported against all things wrong with the world in general. Now at<br/>
this moment in life I like to focus more on the better and positive<br/>
aspects of the Universe and the world. I feel by trying to live in<br/>
harmony with myself and helping my children to do the same I might be<br/>
successful in contributing in a small way to creating peace and<br/>
compasssion and a better understanding of how the world works.<br/>
<br/>
I have long given up this activist attitude and like to do quiet work<br/>
on changes and transformation.<br/>
<br/>
However I often find some parents trying to connect the simplest of<br/>
parenting talk to complex world issues. For example I tried to start a<br/>
discussion on &quot;not always completing that which we start with<br/>
parenting and unschooling in mind&quot; and get  responses on food crisis,<br/>
on dams, and oceans and mining and what not. Parents who I feel  try<br/>
and connect these to how they are being with children.<br/>
<br/>
Since I  Iike to speak plain and direct I cannot sometime be &quot;nice&quot; to<br/>
such responses.<br/>
<br/>
Am I wrong in feeling this way? Should I just keep quiet and<br/>
backtrack? What can I do? Or am I just overreacting?<br/>

The people who are there to learn more about unschooling will appreciate it. If you are too soft people will not think you are serious. But I do think there are kind ways to be direct and I am sure you can point people to the idea of making an activist list to discuss those other topics. Explain your place in life now, as you have to us. Good luck, Dola. :O)<br/>

Where I find people tend to get &quot;stuck&quot; is that they have all these strong values that they want to give to their kids - teach or impart or guide their children toward. <br/>
<br/>
It can help to steer the discussion in the direction of principles and ask people to think about How they developed the values they have - are they identical values to their parents&#39; values? <br/>

Part of the onus of taking on that role is that people will take offense, sometimes when you&#39;ve bent over backwards to express yourself in the kindest possible way! There&#39;s a certain value to directness, though, and a certain value to shutting down discussions firmly when they can&#39;t be gently steered back on topic. &quot;On topic&quot; is the key to keeping a list focused on a particular issue. We all have our pet projects, favorite causes and passions, but comparitively few places to discuss unschooling. <br/>

Here&#39;s a snippet:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Easy versus hard had nothing to do with choice or must. Many times we freely choose to do things that are far more difficult and unenjoyable in the moment for some later ease/ enjoyment/ positive outcome. The key is to remember the choice, the personal commitment, because that is what changes something from drudgery to joy.&quot;<br/>

forum is. People join a group with their own expectations. They assume  <br/>
what&#39;s important to them is important to a group with a similar  <br/>

<br/>
It can be helpful, like Sandra suggested, to give them another forum  <br/>
for such discussions. They have a need to talk about these issues with  <br/>
people they believe share them, so if you give them another place to  <br/>
meet that need, they&#39;re less likely to keep trying in the unschooling  <br/>
area.<br/>

When I was first online with homeschoolers, I would get &quot;I cannot  <br/>

Or I would get mail asking me to contact  my congressman immediately  <br/>

And still, there are large groups of people who think unschooling  <br/>
should NOT involve TV or that homeschooling should NOT accept or  <br/>
condone modern culture and technology, but should harken back to the  <br/>
1950&#39;s (or better yet the 1850&#39;s, little-house-on-the-prairie style).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-29766886">When I ran a Tolkien forum, it was already about a make believe world<br/>
not something that directly influences family life very much (or not<br/>
usually). I still had folders for off-topic discussions like Sandra<br/>
mentioned one can do. I didn&#39;t want the forum to be swamped by<br/>
political or religious infighting ALL over the place just wherever it<br/>
might pop up. So I didn&#39;t allow it.<br/>
<br/>
People could bring articles and stuff like that to the correct folders<br/>
for discussing Off-topic things. But still, I moderated those folders<br/>
to watch for people who &quot;get into it&quot; with others and start fighting.<br/>
The main forum was kept lively with Tolkien trivia contests (whoever<br/>
won could be the trivia master for the next contest), Tolkien chats<br/>
which were pretty crazy and not at all serious, an adult folder for<br/>
crazy adult humor/trash talk geared for people who admitted to being<br/>
over 13 (no way to know real ages but for those who didn&#39;t want to see<br/>
it they had some protection from it being right in their face because<br/>
it blocked access to those under 13). The main forum was for talking<br/>
about Tolkien stuff. And that was it.<br/>
<br/>
The forum attracted people interested in Tolkien stuff since the main<br/>
forum was strictly about Tolkien and his works and related items.<br/>
There was very little going on in the side folders for nonTolkien<br/>
issues. Not enough people wanted to argue in special folders set aside<br/>
for arguing. ;) Funny how that works. Arguing for the sake of arguing<br/>
didn&#39;t interest people.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what email list provider you&#39;re using or what kind of<br/>
controls you have over various aspects of access. That makes a<br/>
difference. There were tons of pictures in the Tolkien forum and the<br/>
ability to block individual things from uninterested newbies or<br/>
&quot;trolls.&quot; You couldn&#39;t lurk anonymously because by default who is<br/>
online at any given moment appears in a list to the side. Yahoo<br/>
doesn&#39;t have that, and if I had an e-list in Yahoo, I&#39;d run it totally<br/>
without side issue folders in order to keep life simpler for list<br/>
owner and readers.<br/>

Thanks for bringing that link, Aravinda, so that others can see an  <br/>
example of an Indian family that homeschooled without a big support  <br/>
network.<br/>
<br/>
Because the family wasn&#39;t using computers, and they decided their  <br/>
service would be the way they lived their own lives, it&#39;s a noble  <br/>
picture but it didn&#39;t help others at the time their boys were younger  <br/>
(maybe it did and it&#39;s just not in the article).<br/>
<br/>
The think about a list such as this, or a &quot;ning,&quot; or any message board  <br/>
dedicated to helping others understand natural learning is that if it  <br/>
becomes too broad and general, some people go away.  There are other  <br/>
places in the world and on the web to discuss diet, religion, farming,  <br/>
simple living, etc.  And there are many people interested in  <br/>
practicing those things who have no interest whatsoever in  unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I was in touch with a couple of the earlier attempts at Indian  <br/>
networking.  For many years there was a  taleemnet  webpage out there  <br/>
with a lot of my writings.  That went unattended for a long time, and  <br/>
now they have a newer website; the older one is gone.<br/>
<br/>
I think the original question here was simply how to keep an  <br/>
unschooling discussion on topic, and the answer is to be willing to  <br/>
explain frequently and to risk complaints for the good of the  <br/>
discussion.  People are rarely  happy to have a post returned.   There  <br/>
were at least four posts returned from this list today.  When such a  <br/>
decision is made by me or one of the moderators, it&#39;s about the good  <br/>
of those who are more focussed on unschooling, not about the feelings  <br/>
of those who don&#39;t understand WHY we would want to have such an  <br/>
unschooling focus.  It&#39;s not easy to do that, but when no one does it,  <br/>
a forum will fall into spammified chit-chatty ruin.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1614574039">Dear Dola,<br/>
<br/>
 There may be different views on your statement  that &quot;Unschooling/<br/>
 homeschooling forums is a new  concept in India.&quot;  For the modern sense of unschooling / homeschooling in India, I have seen such forums, both online and offline for 10 years or so and even they did not seem new, though I was new to them.  Not all  are continuing today and not all are online.  New forums start from time to time, and I hope they continue.  I myself was introduced to concepts of  learning and parenting by one such online forum years ago, and there I found that these issues of personal family life as well as  social issues and connecting with the communities that have  traditionally practiced what we now call unschooling, were prominent and very much connected.<br/>
<br/>
So it was, that in my &quot;enthusiasm&quot; as you so charmingly put it, I posted according to my own understanding and practice of unschooling in my family and in my learning community  (some of whom came over for dinner last week - incl from a family, who was the first example of unschooling  I had ever met, 12 years ago in Gujarat, and whose sons were now grown.  An article about them here &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ijourney.org/story.php?sid=20">http://www.ijourney.org/story.php?sid=20</a> .)<br/>

<br/>
I think forums/lists/message boards, etc., should be clearly described. <br/>
If there is a forum that is described as &quot;Social Activist Unscoolers&quot; <br/>
then all those topics would be appropriate and welcomed by the members. <br/>
If the forum is described JUST as an unschooling forum, I think they are <br/>
off topic.<br/>
<br/>
There is no reason someone can&#39;t start up a list or forum for <br/>
unschoolers who share certain beliefs that aren&#39;t related to unschooling <br/>
and name it and describe it clearly and appropriately.<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;m on a forum that is ostensibly about unschooling, I don&#39;t want <br/>
to have to wade through social, economic, political, or religious <br/>
discussions.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you guys have an issue on some Indian unschooling list, <br/>
which is really not going to be of interest to many people here. But the <br/>
bigger issue might be that of unschoolers being identified with certain <br/>
social or even spiritual beliefs.  I think it is a mistake to let that <br/>
happen and I resent unschoolers who perpetuate it (not when they do it <br/>
out of ignorance, but when they persist in it and insist on it, I mean).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been writing and speaking about unschooling for a lot of years and <br/>
I doubt more than a handful of people have a clue where I stand on <br/>
social, political, economic, or spiritual issues. I have never thought <br/>
it was appropriate to talk about them on an unschooling forum.<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t answer questions about some specific forum - you guys need to <br/>
sort that out yourselves. But I can say that the solution probably is as <br/>
simple (and as difficult) as a clear description of the purpose of the <br/>
forum.<br/>

Some other questions maybe to think about: Do feelings require a value judgement? Is this harmful or helpful? Is it improved by this action? Is it more important to be right or get along with the people in the forum? <br/>
<br/>
For a local homeschool group, the guidelines said simply: &quot;no politics, no religion, we play nice&quot; and that was enough to keep heated stuff off the posts. <br/>
