<div id="ygrps-yiv-793379122">We watched a cool show the other night, on Discovery or World Link or<br/>
something or other like that.  It was called &quot;Kantum Diary&quot;.  It was about a<br/>
bloody battle in Viet Nam during which an American soldier found a diary of<br/>
one of the enemy soldiers.  The diary haunted him for decades.  He finally<br/>
goes back to Viet Nam and meets the man who wrote the diary.  They become<br/>
friends and it is a very healing process for both men.  Good show.<br/>
