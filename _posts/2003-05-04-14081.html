&lt;&lt; It&#39;s frustrating to me also that often the reason for those 10 cm.<br/>
c-sections is that there is some shoulder dystocia (baby slightly turned and<br/>
shoulder gets stuck) and doctors are not trained to deal with that. Big<br/>
heads or bigger babies are really not the problem.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>With Kirby I blamed the hospital and they defended themselves (naturally, but <br/>
I wasn&#39;t impressed).  With Marty what happened the same at home (after he was <br/>
out and we saw him) was his head never was compressed (I forgot the word).  <br/>
Never moulded small.  They were just there at the 10cm hole, head down, like <br/>
a bowling ball trying to go down the toilet or something.  <br/>
<br/>
Then, naturally (again in hindsight) Holly was way smaller and labor was <br/>
faster and maybe maybe (too late).<br/>
<br/>
But she was also a preemie and a more listless baby.   The hospital didn&#39;t <br/>
say preemie.  A friend who&#39;s a neonatal nurse at a different hospital said <br/>
preemie when Holly was a week old.  I said no and she said &quot;What!? Oh HUH!&quot; <br/>
and brought the chart they use and went through it with me there and Holly <br/>
was still registering a month preemie when she was a week old.  We had a hard <br/>
time getting nursing to work, but that news helped me try other things.<br/>
<br/>
Too much not about unschooling; sorry.<br/>

Well, we are all learning a bit more about birthing.  Very educational!<br/>

It is clear that obstetrics has a LOT to learn about how long it takes to grow a baby in the womb.  They talk about &quot;due dates&quot; as if they are something you can schedule months in advance.  I&#39;ve heard way too many stories of babies who are supposedly &quot;early&quot; or &quot;late&quot; but are nothing of the sort.  Jackie was said to be two weeks overdue, but she only weighed 7 1/2 pounds.<br/>

Right!  A year before I had Kirby I broke my leg, spiral fracture, pretty <br/>
bad, and instead of surgery they did a plaster-tension thing where they just <br/>
stretched it out when they changed the casts (frequently, to keep them tight).<br/>
<br/>
I had asked a couple of people how long it would take to heal and they had <br/>
said there&#39;s no way to know.  Four months, six or eight; depends entirely on <br/>
your body, health and genetics, and people are different.<br/>
<br/>
I got pregnant with Kirby while I was still in that same &quot;who knows&quot; cast, <br/>
and they said he would be born on July 5.  Exactly.  &quot;BUT...&quot; I said, and <br/>
they said &quot;No buts.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He was born July 29, normal size, normal health, induced because he was <br/>
&quot;late.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
With Holly I honestly wasn&#39;t sure when I got pregnant, and wouldn&#39;t even give <br/>
the hospital any possible clue-range, because I was determined NOT to have a <br/>
due date, and so I didn&#39;t have one.  So I can&#39;t say, but she did have 7/10 of <br/>
the indications of prematurity, and she was teensy and not very (what&#39;s the <br/>
word for go-getter baby?)...  can&#39;t think of the word.  <br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean she wasn&#39;t in there 9 months (though I have no idea) but <br/>
she just wasn&#39;t quite at the strongest point of her curve.  Or maybe she was. <br/>
 She&#39;s kind of dainty compared to the boys too in other ways.  Graceful and <br/>
quiet (in comparison).<br/>
