enough and I&#39;m not exactly sure what it is that we need to do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I know she&#39;s left the list, but the ideas are still valid. <br/>
<br/>
This is probably more at the root of the problem than anything about needing a curriuculum or helping a 14 year old get into University or whatever else was being stated. Sometimes it is appropriate, or natural after a major upheaval of moving or a new baby or a change of job or whatever to idle. But the idle can go on too long. I get trapped there, sometimes. We move a lot. Or, at least, almost as much as David moved as a child (his dad changed job locations every 3 years, so 3 years in Malaysia, 3 years in Japan, 3 years in the Philipines, 3 years in Oman, etc...). And we do big travel a lot. And after that there is a time of settling in, settling down, get used to the house again, or adjusting to the change in time zones. And you get used to these easy, lackadasical days. Or I do. It takes a change, a movement against inertia to find engaging things to do. And to offer them forward. <br/>
<br/>
I suppose the OP was not able to think beyond curriculum as a means for moving against the lack of swirling ideas in their daily lives, but there are so many ways to step up your activities. Big trips out to new places is one thing. Yesterday we went to Great Yarmouth, a seaside town where we&#39;d never been, David Copperfield is set in Great Yarmouth. We went with friends and did all the seaside things. Linnaea rode a donkey and we played slot machines and claw machines and looked askance and genitalia lollipops and had a lunch of chips and gravy and mushy peas or toad in the hole or steak and kidney pudding with jelly and trifle for dessert. We paid £1.50 per child for 6 slides down the inflatible slide, but, fortunately, it was run by a disinterested and very tanned woman who didn&#39;t care if they were on there for ages. We flake 99 ice cream cones and found the hotel where Dickens stayed while writing David Copperfield and bought toys and cotton candy.<br/>
 There were lots of conversations and lots of play. <br/>
<br/>
I find those days easy to come up with, the harder thing can be making being at home engaging and new. Today Simon went to a friend&#39;s and I had a serious headache. But I really wanted to connect with Linnaea. So, at my asking, she happily came upstairs and lay with me and told me stories whileI lay with a sock filled with rice and lavendar and heated in the microwave resting over my eyes. As the pain abated and I could move I came downstairs and found gentle things that I could do that Linnaea might like to do with me. I invited Linnaea, who was watching a show on television and said she&#39;d come and play when the show ended. I played Mario Kart alone and then with David, but two player made my head spin and he played with Linnaea. And then we played cards and then we played a game like Rush Hour (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.mathsisfun.net/javagames/RushHour.htm,">http://www.mathsisfun.net/javagames/RushHour.htm,</a> an on-line version), but where you topple blocks over to create a run for a little figure to move on, it&#39;s<br/>
 called Tipover. And then we made dinner, nori rolls and then the cats caught a Red Legged Grouse who David and Linnaea tried to rescue, but it just couldn&#39;t survive the plucking at their paws. Tomorrow we&#39;ll have to go and get bells for them to wear. Again, there were lots of conversations and lots of play. <br/>
<br/>
While all those things happened with me, on her own Linnaea also redesigned a Barbie, she went over to her friend&#39;s for a little bit, she threw all the snapits firecrackers that she got yesterday from the joke shop in Great Yarmouth, she played with cats and gave her new stuffed animal, Nommer, a bath and then put her in the washing machine on the spin cycle setting to wring out her soaking body.<br/>
<br/>
Coming to the list and justifying why you aren&#39;t unschooling and asking for curriculum information isn&#39;t going to end up with a response nearly as helpful as coming to this list and saying I don&#39;t know what to do to make my days swirl with ideas. I feel like things are bogging down and I want to spice them up. Here are the obstacles that I don&#39;t know how to overcome. Can people help me to brainstorm?<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of, Simon is spending a lot of time watching youtube vidoes, a lot of which are laugh out loud funny (we just learned the insult Spoony Bard from one). Are there any videos anyone can suggest that I could offer to him? I like having stuff to share. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1764033196"> <br/>
There&#39;s a Weird Al Youtube that&#39;s a parody of Bye, Bye Miss American Pie that tells the sage of Star Wars....my kids watched it at a friend&#39;s house where it was acted out by little lego figures, but we can&#39;t seem to find it here.  The video of Weird Al singing it is also very funny! (picture Emperor Palpatine on piano in the desert, back up singers, etc....it&#39;s hysterical)  Maybe Simon would like it if he&#39;s a Star Wars fan.<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.periodicvideos.com">http://www.periodicvideos.com</a> this link was posted on another list and it is too cool. I love the professor&#39;s hair and the guys in the lab is too funny. We started with Hydrogen because I figured they might show it burn. My 9 year old saw me watching and had to watch it twice. Then he wanted to move onto Helium. &quot;That will be boring because it is inert&quot;, I warned. But they contrasted it to the Hydrogen blowing up! <br/>
