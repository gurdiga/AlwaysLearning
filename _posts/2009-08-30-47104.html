<div id="ygrps-yiv-1451087699">Hello, I am new here, my name is Angie.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to comment on cooking. I have been thinking a lot about cooking lately actually how it makes some mothers and fathers feel tied down. I love food and like cooking if I enjoy it & if my children enjoy it, but something felt wrong about cooking, when I did some self examination I realized that I intuitively felt that raw foods was more natural for me. I am nowhere near going all raw and I don&#39;t think anyone has to go extreme in any direction, but the ability to follow your intuition, with food or habits, I think is important. If you don&#39;t like to cook you may enjoy raw foods. It involves planning ahead a couple of days in advance, or if you don&#39;t like planning you can just get some legumes and nuts and start them soaking and sprouting. Spouts usually take a couple of days, nuts and other things take a day or 2 to soak, there are appliances involved a lot, but do not be discouraged, anyone, any where can sprout & you can often find a food processor or blender on freecycle or craigslist. I make a smoothie for my children in the morning (really easy & fast) with some protein powder & spirillina (spiralina is a great way to spike your children&#39;s food if they don&#39;t feel like eating vegetables).<br/>
 smoothie takes me 5 minutes.<br/>
If you have some things soaked or sprouted preparation is usually 5-10 minutes and the instructions are as complicated as &quot;mix all ingredients & serve&quot; or &quot;put all ingredient in the food processor & serve&quot;. I have eaten food that feels so much more nourishing and alive and spent so little time cooking since getting in the habit of making more raw foods. <br/>
Here is a really simple great book if you interested:<br/>
&quot;Living in the raw, recipes for a healthy lifestyle&quot;<br/>
 by Rose Lee Calabro<br/>
Here&#39;s one on the philosophies and wisdom behind raw foods if your interested: <br/>
&quot;The Sunfood Diet Success system&quot; by David Wolf<br/>
When I have a feeling I usually try and learn what it is leading me to and trust in my own wisdom and the wisdom of my children.<br/>
<br/>
Please email me if you want to talk more about this~<br/>
Many Blessings~<br/>

<br/>
In the absence of medical conditions, I&#39;m generally against the concept of <br/>
&quot;spiking&quot;. It goes against the principle of  supporting children in <br/>
recognizing and trusting their own body&#39;s cues. If my daughter doesn&#39;t feel <br/>
like eating vegetables, I offer her what she does feel like eating.<br/>
<br/>
If your kids like the spiralina, then that&#39;s great.<br/>

<br/>
Good point.<br/>
If a child doesn&#39;t know what she&#39;s eating, how can she figure out on  <br/>
her own what she should avoid or pursue, or what wasn&#39;t sufficient or  <br/>
not?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s good for parents to be honest, too.  Marty doesn&#39;t like spinach.   <br/>
I don&#39;t try to sneak it in on him.  I could, but only at the cost of  <br/>
my integrity and his trust.  And he doesn&#39;t need spinach.  He eats a  <br/>
good variety of food.<br/>
