I especially laughed at &quot;parents are constantly undermining our efforts,&quot;<br/>
and &quot;It is not just the childen who need educating, but the parents as<br/>

Head blames affluent parents for &#39;abysmal&#39; truancy record<br/>
<br/>
Monday February 3, 2003<br/>
<br/>
A headteacher has criticised jet-setting parents for the abysmal truancy<br/>
record of his school in an affluent area of Manchester. New statistics<br/>
revealed that truancy at Wilmslow high school in Cheshire is more than<br/>
double the national benchmark.<br/>
Roy Lyon said skiing holidays and late breaks in the sun were to blame for<br/>
his pupils skipping lessons at the school, which serves a district that is<br/>
home to successful business people and Manchester United stars.<br/>
<br/>
He said: &quot;We have a very big problem in Wilmslow where parents are<br/>
determined to take children on skiing holidays in January or late breaks in<br/>
September. This unauthorised absence is the sole reason for these truancy<br/>
figures.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Mr Lyon warned: &quot;I believe this is wrong. Our staff work very hard to give<br/>
pupils the best possible start in life and parents are continually<br/>
undermining this effort.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He said parents had to take their share of responsibility for a 1.6% truancy<br/>
rate, the highest in the district and among the worst in Cheshire. This was<br/>
well above the government benchmark of 0.7% and the worst record of nine<br/>
secondary schools in the Macclesfield borough.<br/>
<br/>
He was backed by Mary Flynn, senior education welfare officer for East<br/>
Cheshire, who last week organised the first Wilmslow &quot;truancy swoop&quot; with a<br/>
police community action team. School staff joined police and education<br/>
officers on a two-day patrol around Wilmslow and neighbouring Handforth,<br/>
stopping children and parents in the street.<br/>
<br/>
She said the swoop was not just to catch truants, but also to make parents<br/>
aware of their responsibilities. &quot;I think Wilmslow high school is one of the<br/>
most honest schools I deal with in the way it produces its figures. If it is<br/>
not challenged, both parents and children begin to think that truancy is<br/>
permissible. It is not just the children who need educating, but the parents<br/>
as well,&quot; said Ms Flynn.<br/>

The nerve of those parents!  Wanting to spend time and have fun with<br/>

On the one hand, I was impressed to hear her say that she felt a family vacation was as worthwhile as school, but I think it&#39;s only because she will insist that her kids make daily journal entries on the trip, and they will experience science at Epcot.  Still, better than thinking that nothing is more important than sitting in a classroom.<br/>

was going to take a trip to California to visit family and the child in <br/>
kindergarten (only one old enough to be in school) would miss a week of <br/>
school. The teacher said she go only if she went to at least 2 museums and <br/>
wrote a report for school.  <br/>
<br/>
My mouth dropped.  First I didn&#39;t know you needed to ask permission to take <br/>
your child on a trip.  Second she is only 5 years old.  They would probably <br/>
see museums and other touristy things anyway but to write a report.  My word. <br/>
 What pressure for a 5 year old.  They are not homeschooling but the wheels <br/>
are turning.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>An American friend here in Germany who is not military (so she has to send<br/>
her kids to school) was telling me today that she can&#39;t take her kids with<br/>
her on our church choir&#39;s 4-day trip to Italy this spring.  They would miss<br/>
ONE day of school, and she applied to the school for permission to miss the<br/>
day, and the school said no.<br/>
<br/>
I must have had my mouth hanging open, because she endeavered to explain how<br/>
this had come about because of parents taking their kids out willy-nilly for<br/>
vacations and ski holidays and such.  So now you have to ask permission to<br/>
go away, and often the schools won&#39;t grant it.  Many of the parents who have<br/>
the $$ to take nice &quot;extra&quot; holidays have children in the gymnasium which is<br/>
the college-track, important secondary school.  So the school holds the last<br/>
card, which is that if they are denied permission and go anyway, they&#39;ll get<br/>
kicked out of the gymnasium.<br/>
<br/>
Pitiful.  I&#39;m going to take a few days before and after so Tim and I have<br/>
time to go to Pisa and Venice, too.  I can&#39;t imagine that a trip to Italy<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be more educational than a day at school.<br/>
