&gt; It&#39;s <br/>
&gt; Me, Margaret, by Judy Blume.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Holly wanted to read it, so I took her and bought a copy just a bit ago.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
This was one of the books that I enjoyed so much as a child that I have <br/>
always wished Kass & Kree would one day read it. I went to a private <br/>
Christian School most of my life and Judy Blume was censured. Any person <br/>
caught reading or discussing her books was up for, your gonna love this, <br/>
corporal punishment. That&#39;s right, the paddle. Of course I had parents who <br/>
refused to ever sign over the consent for anyone to ever strike me, besides <br/>
which they have never done in my entire life, even when I was a <br/>
cocky-know-it-all-teenager and more than likely deserved a pop in the mouth. <br/>
That was the late 70&#39;s and early 80&#39;s and the school forgot that Scholastic <br/>
books sold Judy Blume books just as they still do. My mom always let me order <br/>
however many books I wanted because reading was a really big thing to me then <br/>
as it is now. I told her I really, really wanted to read this book and she <br/>
allowed me to order it. I explained that I would get in trouble for such a <br/>
thing as to order a Judy Blume book. So what did my mom do? She ordered every <br/>
Judy Blume book on the Scholastic form. I didn&#39;t even want the others, but <br/>
she insisted that there must be something great in these books if the school <br/>
didn&#39;t want me reading them.<br/>
<br/>
I turned in my order with everyone else and my mom received a phone call, at <br/>
work, no less, to say the school would not turn in my form. Bad choice in <br/>
calling my mother bear; for she said that was fine, she would contact <br/>
Scholastic and order direct and explain that the school was refusing books to <br/>
her child. I think I was 10. This is one of my most vivid memories of my mom <br/>
going to bat for me and all the other children for the sake of principle <br/>
alone. She could have easily backed down and taken me to the bookstore <br/>
instead, but her point to the school was that they received benefit by having <br/>
a relationship with Scholastic Books and then to censure their catalog was <br/>
ethically inappropriate and that the decision as to what a child should/could <br/>
read is between parent and child, not child and school. The school backed <br/>
down and sent in my order.<br/>
<br/>
 I&#39;ll never forget the day the order arrived. The teacher called me up to the <br/>
front and said here&#39;s your order Rhonda, don&#39;t open it until you get home. I <br/>
was 10 and everyone else was tearing their orders open. So when I got to my <br/>
desk, tada, the Scholastic faeries ripped open my order. It was like in the <br/>
movies when everything is exaggerated, but I kid you not everyone gasped and <br/>
said look at all those Judy Blumes.....oooooh, you&#39;re gonna get the paddle. I <br/>
laughed at them and said, don&#39;t be silly my mom and dad would never let <br/>
anyone hit me. They turned their gasps to jaw drops and I sat down to look at <br/>
my books. When my mom picked me up, I told her what happened and we laughed <br/>
the whole way home. She said I&#39;d be really pushing it to try and take the <br/>
book back to school for &quot;free reading time&quot;, so that was translated in my <br/>
brain as, &quot;Sure take it to school I dare them to call me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Of course, my luck is, Kass & Kree could care less about reading right now.  <br/>
I often read these books still, not just because I am sitting on the hopes <br/>
that the girls will want to read them too, but because they bring back good <br/>
memories of my childhood and my relationship with my own mother. I never had <br/>
to worry if my mom would go to bat for me, I&#39;m 33 now and she still has the <br/>
same mother bear tendancies, even worse sometimes with Kass & Kree the only <br/>
grandchildren. Luckily, although she doesn&#39;t quite get &quot;Unschooling&quot;, she <br/>
reserves my right to do it and trusts my decisions. I remind her that she is <br/>
the one who molded who I am and that she should be proud to say I stand up <br/>
for myself and my children, just as she did for me. <br/>
<br/>
Okay, I&#39;m gonna start blubbering now, and I know I am rambling, but it just <br/>
occured to me how lucky I was and I can only hope my children love and <br/>
appreciate me one tenth of the amount I do my mother.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Mother&#39;s day to all of you...<br/>
Rhonda<br/>
<br/>
I know there are dads here too, but Father&#39;s Day is next month, so don&#39;t get <br/>
your panties in a bunch. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll have another story by June.LOL<br/>

Holly was a little worried about the book&#39;s title.  Before we bought it, she <br/>
said &quot;Do you think this book is very religious?&quot;  She didn&#39;t want the answer <br/>
to be yes.  I said &quot;I don&#39;t think so&quot; (because I haven&#39;t read it), and so <br/>
when your note came I read her the whole thing and she was fascinated.<br/>

<br/>
Thank you for your kind words. I&#39;m glad it helped Holly. Kass and Kree have <br/>
asked the same thing, because they are very into decerning universal ethics <br/>
vs. religion and are completely dumbfounded by most religious things. I love <br/>
that they question everything and don&#39;t accept,&quot;because the bible says <br/>
so....&quot; as an answer for anything. They do not hold the fears that I learned <br/>
in school, and my mother was the person who kept me grounded and created that <br/>
for me too. It&#39;s funny how attending such a rigid porochial institution <br/>
actually helped mold the person I am now also. In this life that school was <br/>
instrumental in my developing my own thoughts, something not acceptable in <br/>
their view. I&#39;m sure most of you are wondering why I went at all since it was <br/>
not based on religion, I went because they were considered a top notch school <br/>
with entrance exams regardless of age. My parents wanted me to go somewhere <br/>
that had the ability to provide what I required.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have good memories of the school itself, but rather the bond I shared <br/>
with my parents as they strived to undo many of things I was taught on <br/>
Christian principles. I used to get in trouble for things such as reading <br/>
horoscopes and telling people about their other lives, something <br/>
categorically deniable in the church. I think the school prayed everyday that <br/>
I would fail at something so they could have foundation to expel my butt. I <br/>
attended until 8th grade graduation and then chose to attend public school.  <br/>
My parents weren&#39;t happy in my choice, but let me make it. I wish I&#39;d know <br/>
about unschooling back then, It would have fit me as a person from the get <br/>
go. I often tell my girls that what I learned in school was what kind of <br/>
person I never wanted to be. I was self directed then and always allowed to <br/>
work on my own through the schools curriculum. This square peg never fit <br/>
their round hole. However, I think it was at least kind of them to allow me <br/>
to work that way. I guess it was better for them (teachers) too. The less <br/>
they had to address with me in class the better for them.LOL  <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy the book Holly, and remember to never judge a book by it&#39;s cover or <br/>
title for that matter.<br/>
<br/>

That won&#39;t bother Holly.  She has older brothers whose friends hang out here <br/>
and they joke about it a lot.  And she has seen the ad for the Hello Kitty <br/>

<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s similar to how having taught or been really active as a room mom <br/>
or in a parent/teacher group can make it EASY to plunge into unschooling.  <br/>
It&#39;s those who are more iffy and wary about what might be going on in schools <br/>
who are afraid to depart from it.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe knowing for certain what religious education is and isn&#39;t makes it <br/>
easier for you to live without it and without the fear of the lack.<br/>

<br/>
I also loved the Judy Blume books.  The one that meant so much <br/>
to me was Deenie.  It&#39;s about a girl with Scoliosis, which I was <br/>
diagnosed with when I was 12.  Although she had to wear a <br/>
brace and I had to have surgery, I was so happy to have her to <br/>
identify with because I&#39;d never heard of anyone having it.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of that experience...<br/>
<br/>
The school I was at sent me a home tutor and I was assigned <br/>
work to do and the tutor would come every day!  You think they <br/>
could just let me have a year off wouldn&#39;t you?!  Nothing like <br/>
having academic pressure put on top of life changing major <br/>
surgery huh?  Anyway, I just didn&#39;t do the work.  After all, what <br/>
were they going to do, send me home &lt;g&gt;.  Eventually, the tutor <br/>
stopped coming.  <br/>
Then after the summer break (I had just turned 13) my parents <br/>
made me go back to school.  I was still in a body cast from my <br/>
waist up to my neck that weighed about 30 lbs.  Talk about social <br/>
outcast!  I had food thrown at me, was pushed over to see how <br/>
long it would take me to get up, etc.<br/>
School was all downhill for me from then on.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m so sorry for what you went through. I guess all of our kids are luckier <br/>
for it though. Isn&#39;t it strange how our hardships have made our decisions not <br/>
only to homeschool, but to unschool that much more meaningful. I wonder if <br/>
our kids kids will even have any idea what those things are like. I can only <br/>
assume that my children will be even broader with their own chinldren than I <br/>
am with mine. Yet, I think that&#39;s what will all strive for, you know the old <br/>
addage, I want for you what I never had...but in return we all get so much <br/>

Ok, I can feel myself swaying towards a philosophical story so I&#39;m gonna stop <br/>
before I get in so deep it will be Mother&#39;s Day 2004.<br/>

I don&#39;t regret it now.  I feel all my experiences, good and bad, <br/>
have made me who I am.  Who knows...if I had had an easy <br/>
schooling life I may have never thought, &#39;There must be another <br/>
way&#39;, and I might have not found my way to unschooling :-)<br/>
Like you said, Tamzin is certainly now benefiting from my past <br/>
experiences, and that is another reason not to have regrets.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Then after the summer break (I had just turned 13) my parents <br/>
<br/>
made me go back to school.  I was still in a body cast from my <br/>
<br/>
waist up to my neck that weighed about 30 lbs.  Talk about social <br/>
<br/>
outcast!  I had food thrown at me, was pushed over to see how <br/>
<br/>
long it would take me to get up, etc.<br/>
<br/>
School was all downhill for me from then on.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>EEK and eeyew!  How can it be downhill from THAT.<br/>
That&#39;s about the saddest thing I&#39;ve heard for a long time.  <br/>
<br/>
So I guess it&#39;s easy for you to be a confident homeschooler too!!!<br/>

<br/>
Tamzin is so sensitive that I hate to think what her emotional <br/>
state of being would be right now if she was in school.  It would <br/>
be like putting a goldfish in a pirhana tank.<br/>
