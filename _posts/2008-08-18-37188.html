<br/>
<br/>
Some do and some don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
When I publish something wonderful some has written here, sometimes I  <br/>
spruce it up a bit with better punctuation or capitalization or  <br/>
whatnot.  I rarely change a whole word, but I&#39;ll tweak and polish  <br/>
slightly.<br/>
<br/>
For the purposes of this list, the ideas are much more important than  <br/>
the technicalities of their presentation.<br/>
<br/>
If you find grammatical or spelling errors on my webpages (anything  <br/>
starting off SandraDodd.com) I&#39;d be glad to make repairs.  I like  <br/>
getting e-mail about errors in formatting or bad links or any of  <br/>
that.   I don&#39;t promise to regard any recommendation for a comma  <br/>
change, though, because sometimes writing as one speaks can require  <br/>
some dashes and commas.  I don&#39;t mind that; I like it.<br/>
<br/>
I recently found a spelling list in my 25-year-old writing that says<br/>
<br/>
LEARN TO SPELL<br/>
<br/>
apparently<br/>
<br/>
unnecessary<br/>
<br/>
balloon<br/>
<br/>
innocence<br/>
<br/>
So those were the words I was having trouble with then.  I guess I  <br/>
also have trouble throwing things away, as that list is on my desk  <br/>
thirty years later.  (Not the same desk.  The list has had adventures  <br/>
in books and boxes.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I do vocal and instrumental music with small groups sometimes.   <br/>
There&#39;s a difference between singing for fun or to learn a song and  <br/>
in performing it.  And there&#39;s another level of requirement and  <br/>
expectation if it&#39;s going to be recorded, or if someone&#39;s paying us  <br/>
to perform it.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s the same with writing.  If you&#39;re writing for fun and  <br/>
information, spelling isn&#39;t important.  If on a grocery list we  <br/>
abbreviate things or misspell them, it doesn&#39;t matter.   If I&#39;m  <br/>
writing a letter I&#39;m more careful with spelling and format and either  <br/>
write very carefully or I type (word-process-and-print).   If I&#39;m  <br/>
writing for publication, I&#39;m try not to use the same word twice in  <br/>
the same piece of writing, I note the length of sentences and the  <br/>
cadence of the words, wondering how they might sound read aloud.<br/>
<br/>
There are different needs for different purposes.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
There are some things from earlier discussions.<br/>
<br/>
Holly is more interested in spelling and punctuation than her  <br/>
brothers are, but just the other day Kirby and I discussed semi- <br/>
colons.  He never cared before now.<br/>

I could bet with you that most of those making those errors<br/>
have been to school and taught proper grammar by teachers.<br/>
But there are also people like me whose English is not their native<br/>
language.<br/>
I am not too bad but I do make errors writing and talking. I am not worse than <br/>
the average traditionally schooled adult.<br/>
I learned most of what I know of the  English language from just talking and living surrounded by it at a much later age than school children.<br/>

 Does no one care about grammar these days?<br/>
I love spelling, always have.  And I think my grammar is good too.  Even if<br/>
I started that last sentence with a conjunction.  It just felt write to<br/>
punctuate it that way.  And even though the third sentence was really just a<br/>
clause.  And I can proofread well, but sometimes I&#39;m just so eager to hit<br/>
&#39;send&#39; and communicate.  Sometimes when I&#39;m reading written material, I<br/>
literally circle errors with a pen, even if it&#39;s in the newspaper and I<br/>
can&#39;t change it.  I&#39;m an editor at heart.  But I&#39;ve learned over the past<br/>
few years that focusing on other people&#39;s errors only makes me dissatisfied,<br/>
and doesn&#39;t improve the world at all.  I used to think it was practically my<br/>
moral duty to notify people of their typos.  (What a fun gal I was!)  Now,<br/>
if it&#39;s someone who actually says they want to be alerted to mistakes, like<br/>
Sandra did in her post, I might tell them, but even then I often don&#39;t<br/>
anymore.  Instead, I can just move on from errors I see, telling myself &quot;I<br/>
knew what they meant to say.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Gotta tell you, it scares me to hear that expressing herself in writing is<br/>
contingent on the spelling being to your standards, not hers.  If I cared<br/>
about you and your opinions as much as she presumably does, I would avoid<br/>
writing around you, maybe even around other people too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Modeling and playing with language, a lot.  We love talking, rhyming,<br/>
accents, etymology.  My daughter is five, and her spoken grammar is pretty<br/>
excellent, even though I haven&#39;t even started talking to her about what<br/>
nouns and adjectives are.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad you&#39;re here, Belinda, I&#39;ve been learning a tremendous amount<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1339671781">I think that grammar online is always rubbish because people type quickly<br/>
and don&#39;t re-read what they wrote all the time.  Also, most of us were<br/>
schooled I guess! :-P<br/>
<br/>
I think that good grammar comes from reading, and reading, and reading.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t get taught grammar at school (much to my grandparents&#39; disgust) but I<br/>
learnt a lot about English grammar when I studied French and German at<br/>
A-Level (I&#39;m in the UK).  However, I already had a very good understanding<br/>
of grammar just from reading, and have always been a good speller, for the<br/>
same reason.  I think children who grow up in a family that loves books will<br/>
also develop a love of books and will therefore absorb grammar and spelling<br/>
with little or no trouble at all.  And then you can encourage them to read<br/>
funny books (obviously  just for fun!) about grammar like &#39;Eats, Shoots and<br/>
Leaves&#39; when they&#39;re older, which is a fab book ;-)<br/>

Depends how badly the people were damaged by teachers who decided  <br/>

always pointed out the lack of visual appeal of your dicing technique  <br/>
and your presentation on the plate, which wasn&#39;t what you cared about  <br/>
at the moment, how often would you ask them to taste it?<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t make someone care about what we do. But we *can* make them  <br/>
acquire a distaste for what we care about if we try to impose our  <br/>
priorities on them.<br/>
<br/>
Educators do it all the time. How many kids hate and avoid math and  <br/>
science and writing and reading because schools wanted to &quot;make sure&quot;  <br/>
they knew those subjects? Educators  get the satisfaction of having  <br/>
done their part by &quot;making sure&quot; the kids are exposed to what they  <br/>
&quot;need to know&quot;. If the kids fail to retain it or even like it, that&#39;s  <br/>
the kids&#39; fault.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Computers can (to an extent) point out grammar errors. My spelling  <br/>
gets checked instantly as a type. (Tho even its knot purr-fact. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Computers, though, aren&#39;t creative. If we put a mundane mechanical  <br/>
hoop for the child to jump through in order to express themselves,  <br/>
what have we lost when they decide expressing themselves isn&#39;t worth  <br/>
the hoop?<br/>
<br/>
You can make your daughter go through the motions of learning proper  <br/>
grammar. You can&#39;t make her like it. You can&#39;t make her want to use  <br/>
it. You might make her hate it. You might make her want to avoid  <br/>
writing so she can avoid you pointing out how inadequate she is.<br/>
<br/>
Occasionally I would ask my daughter if she wanted me to point out  <br/>
grammar errors. Sometimes she did. Sometimes she didn&#39;t. What was  <br/>
important was the freedom to play with ideas, not the presentation.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Can anyone tell me how they go about getting proper<br/>
&gt; grammar from their children while unschooling without having to do any<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How could your husband get you to iron a shirt perfectly? (Or  <br/>
something you have no interest in learning to do right now?)<br/>
<br/>
Would book teaching work? Would making you practice work? How would  <br/>
you feel about him doing that to you? How would you feel about  <br/>
perfectly ironed shirts? What if he thought a perfectly ironed shirt  <br/>
was really important and that&#39;s why he wanted you to understand how  <br/>
important it was by making you do the shirts to his standards?<br/>
<br/>
My reaction would be &quot;If *you* think it&#39;s so darn important, then  <br/>
*you* do it!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(If, on the other hand, he thought it was important and struggled at  <br/>
it mightily and you weren&#39;t bad at it, it might feel like a nice  <br/>
thing to do for him *if* you knew he didn&#39;t expect you to, *if* you  <br/>
knew he appreciated it, *if* you knew he&#39;d take the task back  <br/>
willingly when you said you were done. (And maybe he doesn&#39;t know  <br/>
about shirts that don&#39;t need ironed. ;-) And maybe doesn&#39;t know to  <br/>
take them out and hang them up as soon as the drier&#39;s done and not  <br/>
leave them sitting in there.))<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t make them like grammar. We *can* make them hate grammar. We  <br/>
can influence them. We can enjoy grammar for our own purposes and  <br/>
draw them into the things we like by our love of it (and respect  <br/>
their freedom to say &quot;No, thanks, not interested.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>By understanding there are good reasons behind good grammar. (Makes  <br/>
reading easier to understand, for one.) By trusting they will read  <br/>
tons of good and poor grammar and be able to judge for themselves  <br/>
which is easier to read. By trusting that they will use their good  <br/>
judgement on what level of grammar they feel is appropriate to a  <br/>
particular situation.<br/>
<br/>
By trusting -- and this is a biggy and applies to so many things in  <br/>
life -- that even if they aren&#39;t doing something doesn&#39;t mean they  <br/>
don&#39;t understand the benefits of it.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something my 17 yo daughter recently wrote. She&#39;s a good  <br/>
writer because she enjoys it and has had the freedom to write in  <br/>
whatever manner pleased her throughout her years. (Automatic spell  <br/>
checking has been a big boon to her spelling.) And even though she  <br/>
*can* use proper grammar and *can* correct her own spelling, she  <br/>
chose to write the following because it was appropriate to the context:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;OMG AND WE&#39;RE A&#39;HAVIN TORNADOS! 83 THE THUNDER BOOMS MUCHLY OUTSIDE!  <br/>
YAYSAUCE TIMES FIFTY!! I think it&#39;s... niftysauce. ;* Sort of. Not  <br/>
really. Actually, not at all. O_o wheeee! (dun use me for an english  <br/>
example thing for good grammer stuffs and spelling of correct  <br/>
werdz..woooo)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As unschoolers, the goal isn&#39;t to trust them to always make the same  <br/>
choices we would. We trust them to be intelligent enough to learn why  <br/>
things are done certain ways and to hone their judgement through  <br/>
trial and error and observation on what standards to use when.<br/>

Does no one care about grammar these days?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Having lurked on a LOT of email lists over the years, I can assure you <br/>
that the unschooling lists, as a whole, seem to have a *much* better <br/>
grasp of grammar, syntax, and spelling. The &quot;school-at-homer&quot; (Doh!) <br/>
lists  (you know---the ones with moms who will actually be TEACHING <br/>
grammar to their kids???) *those* lists need someone with a red pen to <br/>
edit each and every post!<br/>
<br/>
Here, you&#39;re looking at the cream of the crop! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I know I haven&#39;t<br/>
been &#39;teaching&#39; my daughter grammar per se, but I do make sure that<br/>
when she does any writing at all that it is spelled correctly.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Any writing at ALL? Yucky. I don&#39;t see a LOT of what my kids are <br/>
writing. But if anything will be published----or if it&#39;s important to <br/>
them, they know they can come to me for editing/proofreading.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t care about my children&#39;s spelling. They have spell check, and I <br/>
have *much* more serious issues. Well, I *do* care, but we have such <br/>
easy and readily available tools at our disposal now!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  That is a big beef of mine. Can anyone tell me how they go about <br/>
getting proper<br/>
grammar from their children while unschooling without having to do any<br/>
book teaching?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Do you really think you need &quot;book teaching&quot; to use proper grammar?<br/>
<br/>
I have a problem (which is silly because there&#39;s absolutely nothing I <br/>
can do about it!) with people who are PAID to announce on---or write <br/>
for---TV/movies. I think that, if you&#39;re writing or announcing *for a <br/>
living*, you should spend some time to learn the language. Don&#39;t make <br/>
stupid, common mistakes. So I yell at the TV...a lot.<br/>
<br/>
I think that, if you are publishing a book, you should find someone who <br/>
knows more than you do and hire him to edit your work. (I *just* read a <br/>
nice book SOOOO full of errors that it was painfully hard to finish.)<br/>
<br/>
I try my best to *ALWAYS* speak properly. I *do* correct my boys&#39; <br/>
grammar.<br/>
<br/>
When I learned it in school, I had a pretty creepy teacher who would <br/>
scream out, &quot;Phrase or clause? Noun or not? If not noun, adjective. If <br/>
not adjective, adverb! And WWWWHHHHYYYYY???&quot; I remember poor Cal <br/>
Harrelson in *tears* (even if he actually got the answer right!) <br/>
because he didn&#39;t know *why*. His answer every time would be, &quot;Because <br/>
it sounds right?&quot; WRONG answer. But a good lesson for *me*.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want my children to think something &quot;sounds right&quot; unless it IS <br/>
right. So they have NEVER heard me say, &quot;Me and Ben are going out <br/>
tonight.&quot; Never. Not ONCE.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ve NEVER heard me say:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Go real slow.&quot;<br/>
&quot;That&#39;s a good thing for you and I to be doing.&quot;<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s important.&quot;<br/>
&quot;We can ask whomever is at the information booth.&quot;<br/>
&quot;They was asking for it!&quot;<br/>
&quot;We literally died laughing.&quot;<br/>
&quot;He resents me going.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Who are you waiting to see?&quot;<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m going to go lay down for a while.&quot;<br/>
&quot;If I was queen, there would be no school.&quot;<br/>
&quot;We have less chairs than we need.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Just between you and I,...&quot;<br/>
&quot;He was hung.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Can you loan me $10?&quot;<br/>
&quot;You should of picked that up.&quot;<br/>
&quot;A child needs their questions answered.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just a handful of very, VERY common mistakes (&#39;though some are becoming <br/>
&quot;vernacular&quot;), but I don&#39;t want my children to think they are correct. <br/>
If they were to say anything similar to those examples above, I would <br/>
correct them---just as I correct newscasters. &lt;g&gt;. They don&#39;t have to <br/>
&quot;fix&quot; the problem----and they don&#39;t even have to acknowledge my <br/>
presence! &lt;G&gt; But I don&#39;t want bad grammar *in their heads*.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m willing to answer questions ANY time. Occasionally, one of the boys <br/>
will ask *why* something&#39;s wrong. I answer, but I try not to make it a <br/>
long explanation.<br/>
<br/>
Cameron&#39;s been writing a lot lately. He&#39;ll often ask me to edit. <br/>
Usually he has the right *number* of commas; they&#39;re just in the wrong <br/>
places. &lt;G&gt; But it wasn&#39;t until just a few years ago that he started to <br/>
REALLY want to understand *why*. So I&#39;ve started to explain the reasons <br/>
behind &quot;possessives before gerunds&quot; and &quot;transitive and intransitive&quot; <br/>
and &quot;what adverbs and adjectives modify&quot; and &quot;predicate nominatives.&quot; <br/>
But because these aren&#39;t *totally* foreign concepts to him, they&#39;re <br/>
easier to grasp.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s kind of like understanding the *CONCEPTS* of math and THEN adding <br/>
the symbols. Understand how to use everyday language (correctly!) and <br/>
THEN learn the *why*.<br/>
<br/>
In a forum like *this*---where the thought process is more important <br/>
than the delivery---it&#39;s easier for me to let things go. This won&#39;t be <br/>
published (well, maybe electronically on Sandra&#39;s site &lt;g&gt;), and often <br/>
I&#39;m more interested in getting supper made between posts. &lt;G&gt; But I <br/>
think published written works *should* be edited. And I think news <br/>
anchors *should* make spoken language a priority. And I think newspaper <br/>
owners should make their editors earn their paychecks. &lt;G&gt; But that&#39;s <br/>
just me. (*I*! &lt;G&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
But as for &quot;getting proper grammar&quot; from my children: I choose to be <br/>
the example at all times. (In my opinion, Southerners *sound* stupid <br/>
enough with our accents; there&#39;s no need to add fuel to THAT fire! &lt;g&gt;) <br/>
If they hear it correctly from the get-go, it sounds natural and <br/>
&quot;right.&quot; I want the *correct* way to sound &quot;normal&quot; to their ears.<br/>
<br/>
So...be the example you want to see. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Just a handful of very, VERY common mistakes (&#39;though some are becoming<br/>
&quot;vernacular&quot;), but I don&#39;t want my children to think they are correct.~~<br/>
<br/>
I think people talk different than they write and since language is<br/>
evolving, what is &quot;correct&quot; today will NOT be tomorrow. &quot;Mistakes&quot; of<br/>
50 years ago are not considered incorrect now. <br/>
<br/>
I think some people love grammar/language and wish everyone would<br/>
learn it as thoroughly as they have. I met a guy at the InHome<br/>
conference who kept stressing how EVERYONE needed to make sure their<br/>
children knew about radical numbers and degrees and being comfortable<br/>
with all sorts of mathematical concepts I&#39;ve never needed. He was<br/>
passionate about math. It was really fun talking to him but HIS<br/>
passion doesn&#39;t mean everyone needs those same skills.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re great tools if one is interested in them, but grammar and math<br/>
are only useful up to the point that the individual needs/wants those<br/>
skills (like everything else). We learn as we go. I certainly didn&#39;t<br/>
benefit from having grammar thrust upon me by adults in my life. I<br/>
really don&#39;t care about some of those grammar rules now...though once<br/>
in a while I&#39;m prompted to research one.<br/>
<br/>
Now color theory? I think everyone should learn THAT!;)<br/>
Understanding the relationships of colors, how to blend colors you<br/>
want and create the dynamics you want with color is a most useful<br/>
skill. I get annoyed when people don&#39;t know the difference between<br/>
peach and pink or can&#39;t see the slight variances in mixed colors.<br/>
<br/>
We all have our areas of knowledge that we seem to learn more easily<br/>
due to an internal drive.  For many, grammar/spelling just isn&#39;t a<br/>
driving force. There are plenty of tools to utilize should a person<br/>
need help with those. I personally would like to see more parents<br/>
talking about color theory. I mean, how many color theory challenged<br/>
people can this world handle? ;)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve &#39;lurked&#39; for a while on several Yahoo groups and have noticed a<br/>
&gt; tremendous amount of grammatical errors and especially spelling errors.<br/>
&gt; Does no one care about grammar these days?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Having lurked on a LOT of email lists over the years, I can assure you <br/>
&gt; that the unschooling lists, as a whole, seem to have a *much* better <br/>
&gt; grasp of grammar, syntax, and spelling. The &quot;school-at-homer&quot; (Doh!) <br/>
&gt; lists  (you know---the ones with moms who will actually be TEACHING <br/>
&gt; grammar to their kids???) *those* lists need someone with a red pen to <br/>
&gt; edit each and every post!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here, you&#39;re looking at the cream of the crop! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  I know I haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt; been &#39;teaching&#39; my daughter grammar per se, but I do make sure that<br/>
&gt; when she does any writing at all that it is spelled correctly.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any writing at ALL? Yucky. I don&#39;t see a LOT of what my kids are <br/>
&gt; writing. But if anything will be published----or if it&#39;s important to <br/>
&gt; them, they know they can come to me for editing/proofreading.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t care about my children&#39;s spelling. They have spell check, and I <br/>
&gt; have *much* more serious issues. Well, I *do* care, but we have such <br/>
&gt; easy and readily available tools at our disposal now!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   That is a big beef of mine. Can anyone tell me how they go about <br/>
&gt; getting proper<br/>
&gt; grammar from their children while unschooling without having to do any<br/>
&gt; book teaching?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Do you really think you need &quot;book teaching&quot; to use proper grammar?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have a problem (which is silly because there&#39;s absolutely nothing I <br/>
&gt; can do about it!) with people who are PAID to announce on---or write <br/>
&gt; for---TV/movies. I think that, if you&#39;re writing or announcing *for a <br/>
&gt; living*, you should spend some time to learn the language. Don&#39;t make <br/>
&gt; stupid, common mistakes. So I yell at the TV...a lot.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think that, if you are publishing a book, you should find someone who <br/>
&gt; knows more than you do and hire him to edit your work. (I *just* read a <br/>
&gt; nice book SOOOO full of errors that it was painfully hard to finish.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I try my best to *ALWAYS* speak properly. I *do* correct my boys&#39; <br/>
&gt; grammar.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When I learned it in school, I had a pretty creepy teacher who would <br/>
&gt; scream out, &quot;Phrase or clause? Noun or not? If not noun, adjective. If <br/>
&gt; not adjective, adverb! And WWWWHHHHYYYYY???&quot; I remember poor Cal <br/>
&gt; Harrelson in *tears* (even if he actually got the answer right!) <br/>
&gt; because he didn&#39;t know *why*. His answer every time would be, &quot;Because <br/>
&gt; it sounds right?&quot; WRONG answer. But a good lesson for *me*.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t want my children to think something &quot;sounds right&quot; unless it IS <br/>
&gt; right. So they have NEVER heard me say, &quot;Me and Ben are going out <br/>
&gt; tonight.&quot; Never. Not ONCE.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; They&#39;ve NEVER heard me say:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Go real slow.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;That&#39;s a good thing for you and I to be doing.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s important.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;We can ask whomever is at the information booth.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;They was asking for it!&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;We literally died laughing.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;He resents me going.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Who are you waiting to see?&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;I&#39;m going to go lay down for a while.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;If I was queen, there would be no school.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;We have less chairs than we need.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Just between you and I,...&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;He was hung.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Can you loan me $10?&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;You should of picked that up.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;A child needs their questions answered.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just a handful of very, VERY common mistakes (&#39;though some are becoming <br/>
&gt; &quot;vernacular&quot;), but I don&#39;t want my children to think they are correct. <br/>
&gt; If they were to say anything similar to those examples above, I would <br/>
&gt; correct them---just as I correct newscasters. &lt;g&gt;. They don&#39;t have to <br/>
&gt; &quot;fix&quot; the problem----and they don&#39;t even have to acknowledge my <br/>
&gt; presence! &lt;G&gt; But I don&#39;t want bad grammar *in their heads*.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m willing to answer questions ANY time. Occasionally, one of the boys <br/>
&gt; will ask *why* something&#39;s wrong. I answer, but I try not to make it a <br/>
&gt; long explanation.<br/>

<br/>
Not necessarily.<br/>
<br/>
True---language *does* evolve. But that doesn&#39;t make it necessary to <br/>
purposefully botch it---simply because you&#39;re lazy. Or to accept that, <br/>
if we keep ON botching it, that we&#39;ll change it.<br/>
<br/>
When you *know* better, you *do* better. So if you learn (and know) <br/>
that &quot;loan&quot; is a noun, not a verb, why *wouldn&#39;t* you use it correctly? <br/>
I mean---if you KNOW it, why would you purposefully use it incorrectly? <br/>
It&#39;s been used incorrectly for so long now, that it&#39;s considered a <br/>
verb. But it&#39;s not. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
But what if the common &quot;mistake&quot; was that magenta is a member of the <br/>
&quot;green&quot; family? Would that get your goat? &lt;G&gt; Would you not point out <br/>
that it&#39;s more closely a member of the *red* family?<br/>
<br/>
If I insisted that it WAS a green color and used it as a green color <br/>
and that, if we all *said* it was green, it *would* eventually BE <br/>
green, does that make it any more green?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
How many parenting-challenged people can the world handle? &lt;G&gt; <br/>
Apparently LOTS!<br/>
<br/>
But I don&#39;t think that those of us who *do* love to parent well should <br/>
sit by and not be a shining example to those who insist on botching <br/>
parenting. I want to BE the example of a mindful parent---and I want to <br/>
point out bad examples to my boys when we see a crappy one.<br/>
<br/>
We all have our strengths; and although we can&#39;t make others be better <br/>
at what we love, we can be the person they go to for help. We can BE <br/>
the example.<br/>
<br/>
Too many teachers and parents make too many things out to be painful <br/>
and hated. They&#39;re not. I would come to you if I wanted color help. &lt;G&gt; <br/>
I come to these lists for help to be a better parent. Making something <br/>
the &quot;enemy&quot; is not the way to learn it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

If I worried too much about spelling and grammer I wouldnt write at<br/>
all.  These are obviously not my area of strengh.  My dh on the other<br/>
hand is obsessed with it and teases me all the time.  picking out typos<br/>
in everything I write.  he is one of &quot;those people&quot; who see typos<br/>
everywhere and remembers how to spell anything after one viewing.  I on<br/>
the other hand still have to think very hard about the which too, to,<br/>
or two to use.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
The *teasing* part is the problem.<br/>
<br/>
If he knows it&#39;s something you struggle with---and if he knows it&#39;s <br/>
something you would like help in, why would he tease you? Why wouldn&#39;t <br/>
he simply offer his expertise?<br/>
<br/>
What if he kindly gave you mnemonic devices to help you? Offered to <br/>
edit if you asked?<br/>
<br/>
What if he just stopped teasing and became your partner instead? Became <br/>
your ally?<br/>
<br/>
Attitude is everything. &lt;g&gt; Well, almost. &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1083274803">-=-But I&#39;ve learned over the past<br/>
few years that focusing on other people&#39;s errors only makes me  <br/>
dissatisfied,<br/>
and doesn&#39;t improve the world at all. -=-<br/>
<br/>
A couple of times in my life I have made a statement to the effect  <br/>
that I would be a much happier person if I couldn&#39;t spell.  It&#39;s  <br/>
because of that inability NOT to see errors.    It&#39;s very useful  <br/>
sometimes and irritating other times.<br/>
<br/>
The first edition of Moving a Puddle had errors, and some of them OLD  <br/>
errors that hadn&#39;t been noticed or pointed out even though they had  <br/>
been published and were on a webpage.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sloppy and confuseable with &quot;that&quot; and &quot;which&quot; sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Can anyone tell me how they go about getting proper grammar from  <br/>
their children while unschooling without having to do any book  <br/>
teaching?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t do &quot;book teaching&quot; when they were paying me to do so.  Six  <br/>
years I taught English, and never used the textbooks the state  <br/>
provided.  I would tape the boxes severely shut so that at inventory  <br/>
time they were still all there.  We worked with real errors or  <br/>
amusing made-up errors.  That&#39;s what I&#39;ve done with my kids, too.   I  <br/>
don&#39;t do it every time they write, but I helped Kirby with a cover  <br/>
letter.  Holly and I worked together on an insert to go with a  <br/>
wedding gift she made.  She trusted me to punctuate because I was at  <br/>
the keyboard, but I pointed out one or two things I was doing and  <br/>
why.  Marty has a typo or something (I don&#39;t remember) on MySpace and  <br/>
I didn&#39;t pint it out.  It&#39;s MySpace.  And Marty spells better right  <br/>
now than  his dad did at that age, and his dad had gone to 13 years  <br/>
of public school and was a college sophomore at that point.  In  <br/>
college, Keith took theatre and math, neither of which is heavy on  <br/>
spelling requirement.<br/>
<br/>
When they ask or when something comes up we talk about it BRIEFLY.   <br/>
Lately with Holly (16) I&#39;ve pointed out a few odd verb forms she&#39;s  <br/>
guessed wrong (and if a native speaker has to guess, that sometimes  <br/>
means the form is going out of style).  Holly cares about when to  <br/>
hyphenate words in a phrase.  She&#39;s sixteen and she&#39;s starting to  <br/>
write more.  If you&#39;re building an adjective out of a phrase you can  <br/>
hyphenate it.  Holly knows the difference between everyday (an  <br/>
adjective) and every day (an adverbial phrase) but she doesn&#39;t know  <br/>
that latter term, I don&#39;t think.  She knows if you&#39;re telling what  <br/>
kind of thing (an everyday dress or an everyday occurrence) it&#39;s one  <br/>
word, and if you&#39;re telling when you do it, you might do so every day).<br/>
<br/>
The easiest &quot;bookish&quot; thing for kids is &quot;Schoolhouse Rock,&quot; and their  <br/>
songs about parts of speech.  They&#39;re on YouTube, and on CD.  There&#39;s  <br/>
a computer game that has all the songs and games to go with them.    <br/>
Instead of telling them &quot;this is good for you,&quot; you could (as I did)  <br/>
tell them about school reform leading to the creation of the original  <br/>
Sesame Street (cooler than it is now, but no longer hip nor always  <br/>
PC), of ABC&#39;s Schoolhouse Rock videos, which went in like commercials  <br/>
between cartoons when they were new, and soon of The Electric  <br/>
Company.   Now there are many kids&#39; shows to help them learn to spell  <br/>
and count and read, but then there were those (in the U.S.--other  <br/>
countries might not have needed such things as badly, or handled them  <br/>
differently).<br/>
<br/>
Those moms who are too young to have been around when those things  <br/>
were new might do well to read a bit about them.  That&#39;s what the  <br/>
internet is for!  &lt;bwg&gt;   (And for parents who became grammar- <br/>
resistant because of school, maybe review those Schoolhouse Rock  <br/>
songs.  They&#39;re really very painless and decent and happy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-204529677">Proper grammar usage and spelling is important to Zach (17).  Zoe&#39;s  <br/>
(10) budding writing enthusiasm has less patience for worrying about  <br/>
proper grammar and spelling.  Last night, Zoe posted a &quot;message of  <br/>
the day&quot; for her WoW guild, of which Zach is a member.  As I was  <br/>
ascending the stairs to his room to play WoW online with Zoe but on  <br/>
Zach&#39;s computer per his request that I hang out in his room, Zach  <br/>
shouted down the stairs to Zoe, &quot;Zoe, important is spelled i-m-p-o-r- <br/>

same time Zoe shouted the same thing to him.  Then Zach explained to  <br/>
me that she&#39;d spelled it i-m-p-o-t-e-n-t.  Ah ha! I understood his 17  <br/>
yo urgency to let his sister know her error.  As I turned around to  <br/>
go explain, more gently, why she might want to fix the spelling, Zach  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-825106564">this thread reminds me of playing pictionary when i was at uni. Do  <br/>
you know the game? The one where you draw something as fast as  <br/>
possible and people on your team guess what you are drawing to win.<br/>
<br/>
Several of the players in that particular game were illustrators and  <br/>
cartoonists. I remember that game because it was the guy who had no  <br/>
interest or aptitude in drawing that won! The rest of us were trying  <br/>
to get our &quot;masterpieces&quot; just right... he did what he needed to do  <br/>
to get the message across most efficiently.<br/>
<br/>
It struck me that the game was not so much about drawing but about  <br/>
communication... obviously other contexts would have form or drawing  <br/>
being more important.<br/>
<br/>
these days i do a lot of writing. Similarly to the drawing example,  <br/>
while grammar & spelling are important in some contexts on the whole  <br/>
the key thing for me remains communication and how effectively that  <br/>
can happen.<br/>
<br/>
so for those who are getting stressed about where the apostrophe  <br/>
should be or whether to use a semi colon or hyphen... and even if  <br/>
your spelling is 100% correct, it is worth knowing that the hmaun  <br/>
mnid rcgnoieze wrdos for the ltetres in tehm, and not the oderr tehy  <br/>
are in, jsut as lnog as the fsrit and lsat ltetres are the smae.<br/>
<br/>
So you can get away with an awful lot and still communicate extremely  <br/>
effectively  :D<br/>

A friend of mine had written---repeatedly---&quot;diagnoses&quot; as singular and <br/>
&quot;diagnosis&quot; as plural. The first time, I figured it was a typo. After <br/>
the tenth time or so (in two separate posts), I wrote to her off-list <br/>
to let her know. It was possible that she didn&#39;t know or that she might <br/>
not care---or that it really *was* a typo. I *know* she&#39;s not stupid. <br/>
&lt;G&gt; And I figured she&#39;d want to get it right.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t trying to be a know-it-all---and I wasn&#39;t trying to make her <br/>
feel less than. I was trying to help.<br/>
<br/>
She wrote back that she *did* know which was right; but for some <br/>
reason, she was blanking out about it as she typed.<br/>
<br/>
No big deal. She was appreciative that I&#39;d pointed it out. She didn&#39;t <br/>
*want* to get it wrong...again. &lt;g&gt; I don&#39;t correct her mistakes as a <br/>
rule. &lt;G&gt; But I thought she&#39;d appreciate *that* one.<br/>

Seriously though, I think we have a healthy understanding around here <br/>

in details and will spend hours worrying about them.  For example, he <br/>
makes power point games for the kids he works with (he is a special <br/>

just the right pictures etc...  Sometimes his interest in details <br/>
henders actually accomplishing alot.  <br/>
He remembers things like bands who sing certain songs and I do find it <br/>
a little condecending when he tries to quiz me on who is playing a <br/>

There.<br/>
<br/>
Joyce has with words represented spoken English.  She wrote the way a  <br/>
person would speak.   It&#39;s clear and powerful and technically wrong  <br/>
in some places, but for the purpose of this &quot;discussion&quot; (as we so  <br/>
often call it), it&#39;s perfect.<br/>
<br/>
And Joyce spells &quot;judgement&quot; as I often do, before I pull the &quot;e&quot;  <br/>
out.  The correct spelling in American English in this season of the  <br/>
century is judgment.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here:  I went and got someone else&#39;s explanation:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Traditionally, the word has been spelled judgment in all forms of  <br/>
the English language. However, the spelling judgement (with e added)  <br/>
largely replaced judgment in the United Kingdom in a non-legal  <br/>
context. In the context of the law, however, judgment is preferred.  <br/>
This spelling change contrasts with other similar spelling changes  <br/>
made in American English, which were rejected in the UK. In the US at  <br/>
least, judgment is still preferred and judgement is considered  <br/>
incorrect by many American style guides. As with many such spelling  <br/>
differences, both forms are equally acceptable in Canadian English  <br/>
and Australian English. In New Zealand English the form judgment is  <br/>
the preferred spelling in dictionaries, newspapers and legislation,  <br/>
although the variant judgement can also be found in all three  <br/>
categories. In South African English, judgement is the more common  <br/>
form.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1697533105">-=-Now color theory? I think everyone should learn THAT!;)<br/>
Understanding the relationships of colors, how to blend colors you<br/>
want and create the dynamics you want with color is a most useful<br/>
skill. I get annoyed when people don&#39;t know the difference between<br/>
peach and pink or can&#39;t see the slight variances in mixed colors.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This came up in the discussion of what color bark is.<br/>
<br/>
I think part of our collective problem was caused by the Binney &  <br/>
Smith company and their color names.  They long ago removed the color  <br/>
&quot;flesh&quot; because that made no sense and now you can buy a pack of skin  <br/>
tones.   I know &quot;cornflower&quot; as a color, but we used to grow corn and  <br/>
it didn&#39;t have any flowers, just that tuft of cornsilk sticking up  <br/>
top.   And what the heck is with sienna and burnt sienna!?   Having  <br/>
done some damage to crayons, I know that burnt cornflower has some  <br/>
streaks of black in it, but I figured that was carbon from the match  <br/>
burning something in the crayon...<br/>
<br/>
When I was in college I hung out with...  (I hanged out with? &lt;g&gt;)  <br/>
art students and they all had been required to buy a deck of colored  <br/>
cards for some horrible amount of money like $36 (probably like $100  <br/>
in todays gas prices) and learn to put them in order and to find  <br/>
complements and opposites or I don&#39;t know--prime colors and radical  <br/>
colors and degrees of color.   It looked to me like paint samples,  <br/>
only REALLY, really expensive, and bigger.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just a handful of very, VERY common mistakes (&#39;though some are becoming<br/>
&gt; &quot;vernacular&quot;), but I don&#39;t want my children to think they are correct.~~<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think people talk different than they write and since language is<br/>
&gt; evolving, what is &quot;correct&quot; today will NOT be tomorrow. &quot;Mistakes&quot; of<br/>
&gt; 50 years ago are not considered incorrect now.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Not necessarily.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; True---language *does* evolve. But that doesn&#39;t make it necessary to <br/>
&gt; purposefully botch it---simply because you&#39;re lazy. Or to accept that, <br/>
&gt; if we keep ON botching it, that we&#39;ll change it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When you *know* better, you *do* better. So if you learn (and know) <br/>
&gt; that &quot;loan&quot; is a noun, not a verb, why *wouldn&#39;t* you use it correctly? <br/>
&gt; I mean---if you KNOW it, why would you purposefully use it incorrectly? <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s been used incorrectly for so long now, that it&#39;s considered a <br/>
&gt; verb. But it&#39;s not. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-=-=-==-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; They&#39;re great tools if one is interested in them, but grammar and math<br/>
&gt; are only useful up to the point that the individual needs/wants those<br/>
&gt; skills (like everything else). We learn as we go.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Not if we refuse to. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I certainly didn&#39;t benefit from having grammar thrust upon me by <br/>
&gt; adults in my life. I<br/>
&gt; really don&#39;t care about some of those grammar rules now...though once<br/>
&gt; in a while I&#39;m prompted to research one.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Why? Because you *do* care---or because you don&#39;t? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now color theory? I think everyone should learn THAT!;)<br/>
&gt; Understanding the relationships of colors, how to blend colors you<br/>
&gt; want and create the dynamics you want with color is a most useful<br/>
&gt; skill. I get annoyed when people don&#39;t know the difference between<br/>
&gt; peach and pink or can&#39;t see the slight variances in mixed colors.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But what if the common &quot;mistake&quot; was that magenta is a member of the <br/>
&gt; &quot;green&quot; family? Would that get your goat? &lt;G&gt; Would you not point out <br/>
&gt; that it&#39;s more closely a member of the *red* family?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If I insisted that it WAS a green color and used it as a green color <br/>
&gt; and that, if we all *said* it was green, it *would* eventually BE <br/>
&gt; green, does that make it any more green?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We all have our areas of knowledge that we seem to learn more easily<br/>
&gt; due to an internal drive.  For many, grammar/spelling just isn&#39;t a<br/>
&gt; driving force. There are plenty of tools to utilize should a person<br/>
&gt; need help with those. I personally would like to see more parents<br/>
&gt; talking about color theory. I mean, how many color theory challenged<br/>
&gt; people can this world handle? ;)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How many parenting-challenged people can the world handle? &lt;G&gt; <br/>
&gt; Apparently LOTS!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But I don&#39;t think that those of us who *do* love to parent well should <br/>
&gt; sit by and not be a shining example to those who insist on botching <br/>
&gt; parenting. I want to BE the example of a mindful parent---and I want to <br/>
&gt; point out bad examples to my boys when we see a crappy one.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We all have our strengths; and although we can&#39;t make others be better <br/>
&gt; at what we love, we can be the person they go to for help. We can BE <br/>
&gt; the example.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Too many teachers and parents make too many things out to be painful <br/>
&gt; and hated. They&#39;re not. I would come to you if I wanted color help. &lt;G&gt; <br/>
&gt; I come to these lists for help to be a better parent. Making something <br/>
&gt; the &quot;enemy&quot; is not the way to learn it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

prompted me to look up the word &quot;loan&quot;.  I found this:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Main Entry:<br/>
    2loan <br/>
Function:<br/>
    transitive verb <br/>
Date:<br/>
    13th century<br/>
<br/>
: lend<br/>
 loan·able Listen to the pronunciation of loanable &#92;&#712;l&#333;-n&#601;-b&#601;l&#92; adjective<br/>
usage The verb loan is one of the words English settlers brought to<br/>
America and continued to use after it had died out in Britain. Its use<br/>
was soon noticed by British visitors and somewhat later by the New<br/>
England literati, who considered it a bit provincial. It was flatly<br/>
declared wrong in 1870 by a popular commentator, who based his<br/>
objection on etymology. A later scholar showed that the commentator<br/>
was ignorant of Old English and thus unsound in his objection, but by<br/>
then it was too late, as the condemnation had been picked up by many<br/>
other commentators. Although a surprising number of critics still<br/>
voice objections, loan is entirely standard as a verb. You should note<br/>
that it is used only literally; lend is the verb used for figurative<br/>
expressions, such as &quot;lending a hand&quot; or &quot;lending enchantment.&quot;<br/>

said in the previous thread, I found it interesting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-406203948">-=-Several of the players in that particular game were illustrators and<br/>
cartoonists. I remember that game because it was the guy who had no<br/>
interest or aptitude in drawing that won! The rest of us were trying<br/>
to get our &quot;masterpieces&quot; just right... he did what he needed to do<br/>
to get the message across most efficiently.-=-<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
We have a game where you &quot;draw&quot; by putting cards with different  <br/>
shaped lines into a formation to get someone to guess a word.  Our  <br/>
friend Bo (who did the trees for my unschooling page) is GREAT at  <br/>
guessing.  I&#39;m really self-conscious playing that game because my  <br/>
figures aren&#39;t as artsy as the people we play with, but Bo thinks so  <br/>
quickly and broadly in terms of interpreting art that he can get what  <br/>
I&#39;m doing (or what anyone&#39;s doing) really quickly.<br/>
<br/>
Bo&#39;s &quot;grammar&quot; has to do with line drawings.  He&#39;s not a painter, and  <br/>
he doesn&#39;t care so much about color.<br/>
<br/>
Divorce, abandonment, a mean stepfather and school kicked Bo&#39;s poor  <br/>
ass.  He&#39;s a mess.  But he can do this:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-859718745">-=-Actually, I think I ended up telling him where to put it!<br/>
He&#39;s been better, especially after I was so clear. &lt;BWG&gt;-=-<br/>

<br/>
When Keith was my boyfriend, long before we ever thought we would get  <br/>
married, long before we knew we&#39;d have children, we made a deal.   I  <br/>
would spell for him without any explanation if he would give me math  <br/>
answers without any explanation.  No teasing, no teaching, just the  <br/>
answer.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It worked SO well and we were so used to it that when we had kids it  <br/>
was natural for us to just give them an answer if that&#39;s all they  <br/>
wanted.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1860824256">-=-I learnt a lot about English grammar when I studied French and  <br/>
German at<br/>
A-Level (I&#39;m in the UK).-=-<br/>
<br/>
Americans used &quot;learned.&quot;   When I was a kid I had relatives who  <br/>
would say they had et already and OH MY GOSH the horror, in school,  <br/>
if anyone say &quot;et&quot; but in the UK people will say they&#39;ve et and  <br/>
nobody cringes.  It&#39;s cool.  They&#39;ve spelt words too, but we only  <br/>
have that grain nobody much uses anymore for &quot;spelt.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But Americans say some things that Brits don&#39;t.  He use &quot;gotten&quot; and  <br/>
&quot;forgotten&quot; and they don&#39;t.  They say (properly for them) &quot;I have  <br/>
forgot all that.&quot;  Americans would say &quot;I forgot all that&quot; or &quot;I have  <br/>
forgotten all that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My granny said &quot;I reckon&quot; but that&#39;s archaic here.  In England they  <br/>
reckon things all the time, but they hardly guess.  Chaucer&#39;s  <br/>
characters said &quot;I guess&quot; (&quot;y gesse&quot;) and Americans still say &quot;I guess.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not so good to hunker down and inflexibly say &quot;I KNOW I&#39;M  <br/>
RIGHT!&quot; about English.  It&#39;s fine, but English will wash on over you  <br/>
right where you squat with your eyes closed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1665165698">-=-He remembers things like bands who sing certain songs and I do  <br/>
find it<br/>
a little condecending when he tries to quiz me on who is playing a<br/>
song or something. -=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I LOVE that game, though, to see who can name something the quickest,  <br/>
and I love music trivia.  So I don&#39;t mind when people say &quot;Who&#39;s  <br/>
this?&quot;  I like it, whether they know and are quizzing me or whether  <br/>
they don&#39;t know and are glad if I do know.  And the most fun thing is  <br/>
when someone&#39;s on a recording of a group they weren&#39;t usually with,  <br/>
or when a group is doing something written by someone who usually  <br/>
recorded his own stuff.  Like &quot;That&#39;s George Harrison!&quot; when it&#39;s not  <br/>
a Beatles song, or &quot;Paul McCartney wrote that!&quot; when it&#39;s someone else.<br/>
<br/>
Musically I&#39;m courageous.  Grammatically I&#39;m confident.   <br/>
Mathematically, I&#39;m a sad, fearful thing.<br/>
