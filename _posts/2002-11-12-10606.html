My two experts (age 9 and 12) said Gameboy advance rocks on the other <br/>
versions. <br/>
Trevor says the Zelda games are great, but harder for young children.<br/>
They both said Kirby Dreamland and Dreamland 2  are fun and easier.  Don&#39;t <br/>
get ANY of the DragonballZ games, they &quot;totally suck&quot; according to them.<br/>
Golden Sun is highly recommended, but Trevor says for 8 or older most likely. <br/>
Castlevania is easier and fun too. Trevor adds &quot;if they get nightmares from <br/>
somewhat creepy stuff they probably shouldn&#39;t have that one.&quot; (skeletons, <br/>
gore etc....)<br/>
So there&#39;s the advice from my gamers....<br/>
