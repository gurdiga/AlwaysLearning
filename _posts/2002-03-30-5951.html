<div id="ygrps-yiv-572266740">Hello,<br/>
  I have a friend that sees the positive aspects of homeschooling, <br/>
but is planning on sending her child to kindergarten next year. <br/>
<br/>
  I am writing, because I am attempting to find support in her area.<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be helpful, if she could connect with someone with a <br/>
child her child&#39;s age. She has a soon to be five year old boy<br/>
who just moved to NC from HI. <br/>
