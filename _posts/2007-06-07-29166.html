On The Daily Show last night, Jon interviewed Michael Barone, author of a<br/>
new book *Our First<br/>
Revolution&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Our-First-Revolution-Remarkable-Upheaval/dp/1400097924/ref=sr_1_1/002-5611227-7168821?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1181237633&sr=1-1">http://www.amazon.com/Our-First-Revolution-Remarkable-Upheaval/dp/1400097924/ref=sr_1_1/002-5611227-7168821?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1181237633&sr=1-1</a>&gt;*<br/>
which could, to our school &#39;I must hate history&#39; damaged brains be another<br/>
dry version of an English revolution of the 17th Century, instead reads like<br/>
a sappy soap opera (according to Jon). Jon listened to the man speak and<br/>
said, &quot;This sounds like something Shakespeare wrote! King Lear?&quot; Mr. Barone<br/>
then talked of how performing King Lear was forbidden during the reign of<br/>
Mary and William, as the stories were just a bit too similar.<br/>
Now I want to read the book *and* the play to compare notes!<br/>
AND I want to know how this revolution directly impacted our founding<br/>
fathers (our Bill of Rights is almost verbatim from the one created in<br/>
England during the late 1600s -- I had no idea) and the hundreds of years<br/>
worth of ripples originating from this revolution.<br/>
<br/>
So about television...<br/>
Would having the book presented to me alone have changed my feelings about<br/>
reading history? Doubt it!<br/>
Would seeing King Lear without another connection lead me to William and<br/>
Mary&#39;s story? Doubt it!<br/>
In 3.5 minutes, Jon Stewart inspired me (while making me laugh and laugh -<br/>
another bonus!) to take a peek at a couple of stories I&#39;d otherwise not care<br/>
one bit about :)<br/>
