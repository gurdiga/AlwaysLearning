<div id="ygrps-yiv-974091635">I think the South Carolina conference might end up being August 23, since <br/>
October was too expensive and some people were having a hard time scheduling <br/>
for November.  <br/>
<br/>
August 23 is right around the corner!  (Sort of &lt;g&gt;, seems like, compared to <br/>
November.)<br/>
<br/>
Confirmed speakers (or mostly &#39;firmed) are Anne Ohman, Mary Gold, Pam <br/>
Sorooshian and me.<br/>
<br/>
But before that, it turns out I am speaking in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, on <br/>
February 28 and March 1.  That&#39;s a Friday and a Saturday.  The airline <br/>
tickets are purchased.   If August is right around the corner, Febuary 28 is <br/>
just a couple of days away.  I need to buy more tapes and make a dress, so <br/>
that&#39;s that!<br/>
<br/>
I also need to buy a pair of shoes which will be warm and give me ankle <br/>
support and still fit when my ankle swells up each afternoon.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1713113647">You might try some low to medium cut hiking type boots -- I have a pair that<br/>
give very good support and if I had a swelling ankle it would be easy to<br/>
loosen up the ankle-laces and give it more space. Plus they have great<br/>
traction, which might be a comfort if you&#39;re dealing with snow, ice, etc.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Please share what kind of shoe you end up getting!  I can only get on <br/>
sneakers, which would do no good way up north.  Can&#39;t get on my boots or my <br/>
hiking boots yet.  but I put those yak trak things on my sneakers for more <br/>
traction.  And mostly I just stay inside when it&#39;s icy.<br/>
<br/>
I should think, by the way, that no one would mind if you removed your shoe <br/>
(and sock if you can&#39;t find a pair of those to fit either) and propped your <br/>
leg up whenever possible.<br/>
