<div id="ygrps-yiv-1271197181">Hi, All, <br/>
 <br/>
My 7 y.o. daughter is somewhat of an enigma.  She  seems to struggle<br/>
with wanting to have friends (like her extrovert, outgoing sister) but<br/>
is then very picky about any prospective &quot;friend&quot; she meets.  This kid<br/>
is too &quot;this&quot; or that kid is too &quot;that&quot;.   So, she is in the shadow of<br/>
her older sister (9) but also recognizes that she is not like her in<br/>
personality.  She feels she has to &quot;pretend&quot; (her words) to have fun<br/>
with the other kids when get together.  I&#39;m trying to figure this out.<br/>
She just can&#39;t seem to meet that special, just-right kid.  She&#39;s happy<br/>
most of the time, really,  but I think this is an issue that weighs on<br/>
her little mind.<br/>
