<div id="ygrps-yiv-1693861678">It helps unschooling and mindful parenting to be aware of *your* kids  <br/>
and *their* unique needs rather than treating them as generic kids  <br/>
with all the worst possible traits.<br/>

Joyce wrote that on another list this morning and I put it on my  <br/>
quotes page.  I&#39;ve kept meaning to ask people on this list to help me  <br/>
with the collecting of quotes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have a small collection started here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/quotes">http://sandradodd.com/quotes</a><br/>
<br/>
and if anyone knows just how to make a random quotes generator or a  <br/>
quote-of-the-day and database and could send me code I could use on  <br/>
my site and/or on Blogspot, that would be fantastic.  I&#39;ve poked  <br/>
around for years but it&#39;s beyond my understanding, still.   (Being  <br/>
ancient, I could probably write one in Basic, and .... and that would  <br/>
be the end of that. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
A local friend offered to make me one last December and it&#39;s nearly  <br/>
this December and she&#39;s busy, so I&#39;m begging out in public again.   <br/>
(THANK YOU, all of those of you who haven&#39;t made me feel like such a  <br/>
beggar.)<br/>
<br/>
And while I&#39;m begging, if any of you saved quotes or printed them and  <br/>
stuck them on the refrigerator or the bathroom mirror or something  <br/>
and you think others should have them too, please let me know.   <br/>
There&#39;s a link on that quotes page, or you could respond here, or at  <br/>

Thanks!<br/>
