<div id="ygrps-yiv-1020550974">She was harassed in what way?  I&#39;m really curious about why people wouldn&#39;t <br/>
even want the question asked, since we&#39;re dealing with real kids in the real <br/>
world.<br/>

I think people took her the wrong way.  She was simply asking a question, and <br/>
I think some of the members took it as she was accusing them of being part of <br/>
some child pornography thing or something.  But outside of this group, the <br/>
ones that I have belonged to on unschooling have really seemed to be a bunch of <br/>
people that flame others with different opinions or understandings of <br/>
unschooling.  It seemed like TV was the big thing, there were so many differing views <br/>
on TV, and I saw quite a few all out wars this summer regarding TV and <br/>
unschooling on some groups.  It got to the point where I was rethinking my decision <br/>
to unschool based on the way some of these so called adults acted.  Every <br/>
household is different and every household has things that work and things that <br/>
don&#39;t work, and like in homeschooling, there are a million ways to do things, it <br/>
seems that in unschooling, there are a million ways to do things, it&#39;s all in <br/>
what works in your individual families. I appreciate that this group seems to <br/>
be able to ask questions and state opinions without being harassed by people <br/>
with differing views.  I hope that all made sense.  Susan<br/>
