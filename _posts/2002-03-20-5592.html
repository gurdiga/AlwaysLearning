<div id="ygrps-yiv-530774050">Good Day!<br/>
<br/>
Have just returned mentally from a trip that ended physically last Friday <br/>
evening.  I took both girls to Tampa (12-hour drive) without dh.  He&#39;s home <br/>
sick now, poor guy.  I missed you all and it is sure nice to &quot;hear your <br/>
voices&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I need to get started on the spring cleaning stuff, too.  I have noticed that <br/>
kitchen items are migrating to other cabinets and I am wondering if this is <br/>
the result of mating season for appliances or just my imagination.  <br/>
<br/>
I took the girls to the local kids museum yesterday...lo, and behold, it was <br/>
packed with elemetary school kids as far as the eye could see.  Mira (4.5, <br/>
who let me know on Sunday that &quot;if you would just let me do everything I want <br/>
to do, Mommy, we would be fine&quot;) said, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t want to go to school.  <br/>
Those kids are loud and pushy.&quot;  Hurray for us!  I told her I would not be <br/>
sending her to school.  She was so glad!  She just hugged me for  a long time.<br/>
<br/>
Congratulations Sandra and Mary!  You&#39;&#39;ve re-entered the vortex.  Maybe I <br/>
will get over there again now that the support is available.  (Hugs to you)<br/>
<br/>
Reenie, thanks for all the cool sites.  I am going to be checking them out <br/>
for days!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, all.  I feel like I am &quot;home&quot; when I read your messages.<br/>
