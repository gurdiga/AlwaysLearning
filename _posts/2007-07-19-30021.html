Bet they don&#39;t get that comment too often.  (mainstreeam)  I know what you<br/>
mean though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1436348794">Gene Simmons bought me my first legal drink at midnight on the eve of<br/>
my 21rst bday! I had gone to see a friend from high school (we were<br/>
both living in LA at the time) play with his band at the Troubador<br/>
(sp?). My friend was a drummer and Gene Simmons was his absolute idol.<br/>
 Simmons happened to be there scouting talent and my friend couldn&#39;t<br/>
resist going up to him at the bar to tell him so.  I was just standing<br/>
there and Mr. Simmons shook his hand while my friend gushed about how<br/>
he had influenced every part of his life etc etc.  It was so loud that<br/>
his words were drowned out and Simmons leaned in and asked him who his<br/>
friend (me) was. So Jason introduced me and told him I was turning 21<br/>
at midnight.  Simmons looked at his watch and it was midnight and he<br/>
leaned in and said &quot;Happy Birthday! Please allow me the honor of<br/>
buying you your first legal beer&quot; I said sure and we drank together<br/>
and pretended to have a conversation - very animated, just moving our<br/>
mouths and gesturing, because it was so incredibly loud! It was fun.<br/>
He was very nice and funny and very polite.  Then someone came and<br/>
ushered him away.  A Fun memory.<br/>
