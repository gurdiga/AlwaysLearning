<div id="ygrps-yiv-1903251522">&lt;&lt;I used to make myself sick, just so I can sleep with my Mom.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We lived in a small two-bedroom apartment in LA.  I was a kid who had <br/>
problems falling asleep, sleeping in general... lot&#39;s of stress as a child <br/>
to be perfect.  I was also afraid of a monkey (go figure) peeking his head <br/>
up from the foot of my bed and snatching me.  When I would hear my mom click <br/>
off the news and start down the hall, I would begin to cough - she never <br/>
came in, never checked.  I remember those moments to this day.  Over time I <br/>
gave up (sucked it up) and thought that I was the only kid who experienced <br/>
those kinds of things.<br/>
<br/>
I can never think of doing that to Tails.  I can never imagine leaving her <br/>
in a bedroom to cry herself to sleep.  Ohhh, and making sure that mom didn&#39;t <br/>
hear the crying because she would then be in trouble.<br/>
<br/>
To me, co-sleeping is peaceful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1392657900">I often ponder as to why parents get so disconnected from their inner <br/>
self, from their childreen needs and desires and force the children <br/>
to solitare sleep before they are emotionally ready.<br/>
<br/>
To me it always felt that unschooling is a natural continuation to <br/>
attachment parenting.  If you are already really tuned into your <br/>
child&#39;s needs from birth, why would you ever ship them away to school <br/>
and why would you force them to do something that is not natural?  I <br/>
am talking about passive learning, of course...<br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents, but of course I am preaching to the choir :)!<br/>
<br/>
Kind regards,<br/>
Anna<br/>
