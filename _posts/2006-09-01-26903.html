A new article on unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s coolest about it is the expert they quoted was basically  <br/>
supportive!<br/>
<br/>
Someone said &quot;I turned the TV off because I was tired of fighting  <br/>
with the cartoon network&quot;<br/>
or something and I think the same person was quoted as saying &quot;I  <br/>
&#39;strew their paths&#39;&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-472211339">So maybe some of them aren&#39;t radical unschoolers... but it was a good<br/>
article... I loved that it didn&#39;t get negative like some of them do.<br/>
