<div id="ygrps-yiv-917435355">Hi~I just reread my post and would like to apologize as we didn&#39;t just ride <br/>
it out. We did what you are speaking of. Providing safe, healthy alternatives <br/>
for him to deal w/these powerful emotions. It&#39;s an ongoing process...younger <br/>
children tend to have a difficult time talking about their emotions and I&#39;ve <br/>
read aren&#39;t neurologically ready to until they are at least ten, I think it was. <br/>
We&#39;ve incorporated into out daily living ways to express ourselves safely and <br/>
harmlessly and I feel it&#39;s important to provide opportunities for my son to <br/>
feel empowered. It is definitely an ongoing process w/no quick fix, at least <br/>
for us.<br/>
<br/>
Would also like to just thank everyone for their insights as I&#39;ve been <br/>
lurking for a few weeks and really appreciate theand heartfelt honesty of this <br/>
group.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-373635933">Hi Sandra,  I appreciate the discussion we are having<br/>
and the thoughts that you have shared.  I would like<br/>
to add a few clarifying thoughts of my own.<br/>
<br/>
...on choice,  below you responded to my point about<br/>
reaction versus choice... <br/>
<br/>
...I don&#39;t think anyone ever chooses &quot;the exact<br/>
opposite&quot; in all things........But with unschooling<br/>
it&#39;s neither of those things.....<br/>
<br/>
I never meant to imply that someone would choose the<br/>
opposite in all things, however in individual things<br/>
like how we discipline, how we nurture, how we set<br/>
boundaries, etc... the choice itself may either be a<br/>
conscious choice or a reaction depending on how much<br/>
we have resolved any issues, should there be any that<br/>
would influence a reaction versus a true choice.  To<br/>
just outright say that with unschooling this is not<br/>
the case, in my opinion is a generalization that does<br/>
not take into account the personal experience of the<br/>
individual in the given situation.<br/>
<br/>
Again to my point about inadequate boundaries where i<br/>
write:<br/>
<br/>
-=- Inadequate boundaries leaves the child not knowing<br/>
what is and is not safe, they don&#39;t know where the<br/>
parent actually is, and that is a scary feeling.-=-<br/>
<br/>
You responded by saying,<br/>
<br/>
&quot;That&#39;s not an issue with attachment parenting.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well, on one level I agree with you, true AP honors<br/>
the full needs of the child including the needed<br/>
boundaries etc..., however, given that we are all<br/>
human, we bring into our parenting experiences both<br/>
the healthy and unhealthy influences from our past. <br/>
At times these influences negatively effect our<br/>
ability to set healthy boundaries even when in theory<br/>
we are APing.  I have witnessed many AP parents<br/>
struggle with their own childhood issues and therefore<br/>
at times be unable to identify the true needs of their<br/>
child.  Parenting consciously is a ongoing growth<br/>
experience. We are not Gods, we make mistakes, we<br/>
learn.  The decision to practice AP while a huge step<br/>
in the right direction, does not excempt us from these<br/>
lessons, or from the influences of our past.  Only our<br/>
personal committment to seperating out our own issues<br/>
from those of our child will allow our children to<br/>
unfold naturally.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1425231740">Hi Heidi,<br/>
<br/>
I am glad that you are finding a solution that seems<br/>
to be working.  My son went through a few infrequent<br/>
expressions of wanting to hurt himself if he didn&#39;t<br/>
get his way.  My response, was to hold him closely,<br/>
tell him i love him, and show how sad i was to see him<br/>
do that.  I told him it was my job to protect him, and<br/>
i wasn&#39;t going to let him hurt himself. So i rocked<br/>
him, cuddled him, nursed him.  I directed his<br/>
anger/frustration outwards to hitting pillows, or<br/>
giving him the language that could help him articulate<br/>
his feelings.  I matched his intonations with equal<br/>
passion when he verbalized &quot;I want to...&quot;,  I repeated<br/>
his statements to let him know i heard him.  I<br/>
affirmed his right to be angry.  And because i loved<br/>
him it was my job to keep him safe.  He seemed to get<br/>
it, and let it go as an option. <br/>
<br/>
 It sounds to me like your solution is very similar. <br/>
You surround her with love, and let her know it is sad<br/>
for you when she hurts herself.  Repeating the injury<br/>
on yourself, is dramatic.  My only concern is that it<br/>
might be hard to understand why mommy can do it and<br/>
not her, but it sounds like she is getting the<br/>
underlying message which is both mommy and she should<br/>
not hurt themselves.  I would say trust your intuition<br/>
on this one, and observe her response.  The comment by<br/>
another list member about being careful about<br/>
therapists is a good one.  As a counselor myself, i<br/>
hate to say that there are many professionals out<br/>
there that are not child centered, and are quick to<br/>
label and create more problem than previously existed.<br/>
 Having said all that, it is a gem to find a truly AP<br/>
centered therapist who provides the needed help. <br/>
Someone mentioned Jan Hunt.  Jan is wonderful.  I have<br/>
spoken with her and she is great.  I found her<br/>
particular useful for information and resouces, as<br/>
well as normalizing the sometimes unheard of<br/>
behaviours that our children sometimes choose.  If you<br/>
were wanting to do your own deep work around an issue<br/>
however, then someone else might be a better choice,<br/>
as i found Jan to be more of an educator than a<br/>
therapist.  (This might be perfect)<br/>
<br/>
In my response to you I  didn&#39;t mean for it to  sound<br/>
like I definately thought that you were &quot;unparenting&quot;,<br/>
however i did wonder if healthy boundaries were in<br/>
place. I am glad to hear that they are. You are<br/>
absolutely right when you say &quot;you can&#39;t always do as<br/>
she demands&quot;, and your statement let&#39;s me know that<br/>
you do have boundaries with her.  The video choice,<br/>
even though it is Disney, still concerns me.  It is<br/>
not a choice that i would make. Even though the self<br/>
hurting behaviour began before the videos started i<br/>
would still be very selective about showing them. I am<br/>
curious to know what harm you think could come from<br/>
limiting her viewing or something that potentially may<br/>
be disturbing to her?  I agree with the other reader<br/>
that said she might be a wonderfully sensitive child<br/>
who has difficultly processing the images in these<br/>
videos.  However, above all, I think that after<br/>
gathering all the information, you are the best one to<br/>
make the decision for your child, and you will <br/>
ultimately know what is best.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Any way Heidi,  I wish you the best.  blessings, mary<br/>

&gt;    From: badolbilz &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:ynxn96@...">ynxn96@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt; Subject: Re: thoughts about kids hurting themselves.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thank you, Mary.  We have changed our lifestyle<br/>
&gt; since becoming <br/>
&gt; unschoolers, but not to a point of outright<br/>
&gt; unparenting, which is what I <br/>
&gt; suspect you read into it.  My comment on her perhaps<br/>
&gt; picking up violence <br/>
&gt; from movies was based on movies like Sinbad and<br/>
&gt; other cartoon-types <br/>
&gt; where someone gets killed.  Perhaps she&#39;s not ready<br/>
&gt; for these things, <br/>
&gt; but she is interested in watching them and I feel it<br/>
&gt; would be more <br/>
&gt; harmful to forbid these things than to let her<br/>
&gt; watch.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Mostly, she hurts herself or threatens to when she<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t get her way. <br/>
&gt;  An example would be if I don&#39;t do what she asked at<br/>
&gt; just that moment, <br/>
&gt; she threatens to hurt herself.  If I get after her<br/>
&gt; for doing something <br/>
&gt; inapproriate to one of her sisters, she may threaten<br/>
&gt; to kill herself. <br/>
&gt;  In reading that, you may think she&#39;s just spoiled. <br/>
&gt; The worry then is <br/>
&gt; sometimes she actually will hurt herself.  Then<br/>
&gt; older she gets, there <br/>
&gt; are more ways she can hurt herself.  I can&#39;t always<br/>
&gt; do as she demands. <br/>
&gt;  I can&#39;t punish her for hurting herself.  I haven&#39;e<br/>
&gt; been able to stop <br/>
&gt; her from hurting herself.  I have thought long and<br/>
&gt; hard about what to do <br/>
&gt; to help her learn to deal with impatience, anger,<br/>
&gt; and frustration.  It <br/>
&gt; could be just a stage she&#39;s going through at 3 1/2. <br/>
&gt; What really bothers <br/>
&gt; me is that she&#39;s been hurting herself since about 18<br/>
&gt; months.  It <br/>
&gt; definitely wasn&#39;t from watching movies and tv then.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So I&#39;ve began a new strategy.  It&#39;s rather extreme<br/>
&gt; and I really don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; know if it&#39;s the &quot;right&quot; thing to do...but she<br/>
&gt; hasn&#39;t hurt herself in <br/>
&gt; over two weeks.  It began like this:  After one<br/>
&gt; episode where she was <br/>
&gt; yanking her hair and threatening to run out in the<br/>
&gt; street to get hit by <br/>
&gt; a car, I say her on my lap and said that I loved<br/>
&gt; her.  That every time <br/>
&gt; she got hurt, it hurt me because I love her so much.<br/>
&gt;  I told her that I <br/>
&gt; gave birth to her out of my tummy because I wanted<br/>
&gt; her to be alive and <br/>
&gt; to be happy.  Then I told her that because she<br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t see how much it <br/>
&gt; hurt me when she hurt herself, I would show her. <br/>
&gt; From then on, whenever <br/>
&gt; she hurt herself, I would do the same thing to<br/>
&gt; myself.  And I have.  The <br/>
&gt; last time she&#39;s hurt herself was at this computer. <br/>
&gt; She was upset <br/>
&gt; because the game she was playing was too hard so she<br/>
&gt; began to slam her <br/>
&gt; knee on the edge of the desk.  So I did the same.  I<br/>
&gt; ended up cutting my <br/>
&gt; knee in two places and making a huge bruise.  I know<br/>
&gt; this sounds awful <br/>
&gt; and very dramatic and I guess it is.  But it made a<br/>
&gt; huge impression on <br/>
&gt; her.  She was very upset to see her mommy hurt.  I<br/>
&gt; told her that&#39;s how <br/>
&gt; upset I feel when she hurts herself.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have no idea if this is the right thing to do. <br/>
&gt; But it&#39;s all I could <br/>
&gt; think of.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thank you for your insights.  Heidi<br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Mary, when you say this it reminds me of my neighbor,<br/>
who told me she couldn&#39;t let her kids out of the house<br/>
anymore during the day, because when she was drunk she<br/>
always lost them, which made her husband mad...<br/>
<br/>
But seriously, what kind of &quot;adequate boundaries&quot; are<br/>
you suggesting need to be in our children&#39;s lives?  To<br/>
keep them away from age-inappropriate movies?  Maybe<br/>
plug in our TV and internet watch dogs to keep them<br/>
from straying into that which they surely don&#39;t<br/>
need...even if they want it?  Oh, better read all of<br/>
their library books before they do as well....there<br/>
might be something suspect in them....<br/>
<br/>
In our house, the viewer decides for him and herself<br/>
what to watch, and no one else...But mom and dad are<br/>
there to discuss before, during and after what they<br/>
might see.....Does that make me a &quot;bad&quot; parent, Mary? <br/>
I don&#39;t see my children looking around saying &quot;Where<br/>
is my mother!  I&#39;m scared!&quot; as you suggest....<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I am misreading you, but I think there are<br/>
many unschoolers who would have &quot;inadequate<br/>
boundaries&quot; in your opinion.....<br/>
