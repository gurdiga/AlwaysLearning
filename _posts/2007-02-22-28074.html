&quot;B&quot; and &quot;V&quot; are really close in a person&#39;s mouth.   W is close but  <br/>
not AS close.  But in German, &quot;Wilhelm&quot; starts with a &quot;v&quot; sound, and  <br/>
the name &quot;William&quot; has several forms back 800 years and so that were  <br/>
spelled Gwy-   and &quot;Erwilliam&quot; and other lip or lip and tooth  <br/>
things.  (bi-labial fricative or libiodental, for those who care to  <br/>
get technical)...<br/>
<br/>
Will and Willy were very common nicknames for William in the  <br/>
Renaissance and Middle Ages.  Will was very common, and so we have  <br/>
&quot;Wilson&quot; (also  &quot;Williams&quot; and &quot;Williamson,&quot; but Wilson is more  <br/>
common than either, I think).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>At a couple of periods in English history the pool of acceptable  <br/>
names shrank. (I don&#39;t know why.) So a town would have lots and lots  <br/>
of Williams and Richards and Margarets and just a few other names.  <br/>
(If I&#39;m remembering right, families might give their kids all the  <br/>
same name and then just use nicknames and diminutives.) It was  <br/>
already common to tack on a descriptor that identified someone&#39;s  <br/>
profession (Baker), location (Applegate) or feature (Whitehead) and a  <br/>
town might even have more than one Richard Baker. So it became common  <br/>
to come up with nicknames that rhymed and diminutives (an ending  <br/>
often used for a child, for example we add -y or -ie: Doug --&gt; Dougie)<br/>
<br/>
Just a few examples of Medieval nicknames:<br/>
<br/>
Dick, Hick and Rick (I think Richard was pronounced Rikard at the  <br/>
time those were created so the Rich nickname is much newer)<br/>
Dickon, Dickcox (which is a double diminutive), Digg, Diggle   <br/>
(another double diminutive)<br/>
Hitch, Hitchcock (double diminutive)<br/>
<br/>
Roger - Hodge, Hodgkin, Dodger, Dodgin<br/>
<br/>
Will, Willot, Willcox, Willkin<br/>
<br/>
Mary - Marian, Mariott<br/>
<br/>
Margaret - Margery, Magg, Madge, Meg Megget, Peg (which might have  <br/>
been influenced by the meaning of Margaret which is Pearl).<br/>
<br/>
Bill is actually much newer (so there aren&#39;t any surnames built from  <br/>
that nickname like there are for Will: Willson, Wilkinson, etc.) but  <br/>
probably came from the old practice of rhyming nicknames. There&#39;s a  <br/>
long history for the Cockneys to give nicknames that rhyme with  <br/>
things like:<br/>
<br/>
Apples = apples and pears = stairs (&quot;Get up them apples!&quot;)<br/>
Bread = bread and honey = money<br/>
China = china plate = mate (&quot;Alright, me old china!&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cockneyrhymingslang.co.uk/">http://www.cockneyrhymingslang.co.uk/</a><br/>
<br/>
so there there&#39;s probably some connection there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1760082249">The only &quot;Bo&quot;  not &quot;Beau&quot;  I know is an adult and is actually the &quot;son of<br/>
Bill/William&quot;  although possibly a William Jr.<br/>
<br/>
I usually assumed it was a nickname akin to the Southern U.S. usage of Bud<br/>
or Buck or Buddy or Butch.<br/>
Or maybe similar to the phenomenon that seems to have every Irish Catholic<br/>
boy called &quot;Paddy&quot;  at one time or another.<br/>
