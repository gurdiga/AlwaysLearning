<div id="ygrps-yiv-1541857935">I know I am basically a lurker on this list, but I have one request from<br/>
everyone.  I usually have very little time to read my email.  Usually I<br/>
get two email digests from AlwayLearning with anywhere from 25 to 50<br/>
messages.  This morning, Arpil 24th, I got one with only 16 messages, of<br/>
which 9 of the subject lines read, re: Digest Number ###.<br/>
<br/>
With my limited time, I generally don&#39;t real every message, just the<br/>
topics that interest me.  If a large portion of the topics say re: Digest<br/>
Number ###, then unless there is a topic or two I am really interested in,<br/>
then I will just delete the entire email.  It also makes it difficult for<br/>
me to follow a topic as I will skip to the related messages to keep a<br/>
topic line flowing.  This helps me remember, understand, follow, etc the<br/>
flow of the topic.  Lately, there has been a dramatic increase in people<br/>
not putting in the subject line what they are posting their discussion<br/>
about.  I will also just skip reading these posts because I just don&#39;t<br/>
want to break my train of though to figure out if the post is about a<br/>
topic I am interested in, and if it is, if it is a topic a am currently<br/>
reading about.  So, if you are trying to post some information for<br/>
everyones benefit, then it is probably not coming to my attention.  Thus,<br/>
I am posting this message.<br/>
<br/>
I am not telling anyone that they have to put an appropriate title in the<br/>
subject line.  I am just asking, if it is not too much trouble and you<br/>
happen to remember, could you please try to do this.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
