could ask my opera teacher tonight, she may know - but I think it may have <br/>
been simply because Wagner was an incredible perfectionist, and wanted a <br/>
deeper sound than he could get with a regular tuba.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve heard that aria on SO  many commercials, and cartoons, and stuff like <br/>
that... I think it was in M*A*S*H or something... I never really realised <br/>
what it was until I saw it on a Website, actually NAMED, and heard it there. <br/>
But I really like it!<br/>

now!)<br/>

many) opera, or if it&#39;s just featured briefly, as a signature for<br/>
something.<br/>
<br/>
Did he just want a more beautiful sound, or a specific sound for a<br/>
specific reason?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I can figure this out with a search engine.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Which, btw for Pat and others, is how many people (children) are introduced<br/>
to classical music.  Spike Jones Murders the Classics sits on our CD shelf,<br/>
as does a CD of Looney Toons hits.  The first time your kids hear &quot;Carmen&quot;<br/>
and say, &quot;Oh, I heard that on Gilligan&#39;s Island,&quot; you&#39;ll laugh, trust me.<br/>
<br/>
(And, despite protests of classical music-haters, people hear *modern*<br/>
classical music all the time -- it makes its way into our lives as<br/>
soundtracks to films and TV shows.)<br/>
