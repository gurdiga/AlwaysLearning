I am assuming you meant to send that just to me!!?<br/>
I was wondering what you meant yesterday about the &quot;second email&quot; when I&#39;d <br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
