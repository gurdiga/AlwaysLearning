An interesting thing about this study is that two of the informant families are mine and Duke Cariadoc&#39;s, though not in that context.  Both our families are prominently featured.   It&#39;s a few years old, but wasn&#39;t online.<br/>
<br/>
From the list of a few dozen &quot;informants&quot; for the research:<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, Kirby, Marty, & Holly Dodd; ... David Friedman & his family...<br/>
<br/>
This copy of the report  is hosted on a page by a science educator in India.  I got to meet him last fall in his &quot;lab.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
The interviewer is more artist than researcher, and we had fun interacting with her.<br/>
