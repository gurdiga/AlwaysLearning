<div id="ygrps-yiv-990892311">My oldest child is going to be seven in two weeks. <br/>
<br/>
She reads a little bit; for example, she could read a simple sentence <br/>
or two with little or no help.<br/>
<br/>
I read to her and her younger sister a lot, and we all enjoy it. For <br/>
example, we&#39;ve read all the Junie B Jones books and last night we <br/>
read the first four chapters in Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing.<br/>
<br/>
She sometimes dictates stories to me, and sometimes even illustrates <br/>
them, but she doesn&#39;t like to do the actual writing herself.<br/>
<br/>
She sometimes writes her &quot;own stuff&quot; ... for example, I&#39;ll find a <br/>
letter that one of her dolls wrote to another. They may be about 3 <br/>
sentences long. I can read most of it, but it is mostly phonetic <br/>
spelling (ie, &quot;wr&quot; for &quot;were&quot;), no real punctuation, all caps, that <br/>
kind of thing.<br/>
<br/>
So my question is ... Should I be DOING more to help her in this <br/>
area? I&#39;m concerned that, because I don&#39;t want to &quot;teach&quot; or &quot;do <br/>
school,&quot; I&#39;m instead doing nothing, which may not be good either.<br/>
<br/>
Should I just get out of the way and let things unfold more on their <br/>
own, and not do anything else unless she asks? <br/>
<br/>
Should I ... encourage something? Initiate something? Suggest <br/>
something? Play certain games with her? Give information and point <br/>
out certain things?<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I&#39;m asking is, How much do I get involved, how do I KNOW <br/>
how much to get involved, and what kinds of <br/>
activities/games/conversations whatever might be helpful at this <br/>
point?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<br/>
Ask yourself, &quot;Does *she* need to read and write to be better at  <br/>
being her right now self?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The only reason to push is if there were some deadline for learning.  <br/>
But that&#39;s a myth. Kids naturally learn to read between 6 and 12. And  <br/>
some even outside that range.<br/>
<br/>
The best you can do is create a home where her encounters with  <br/>
reading and writing are positive so she doesn&#39;t have anything  <br/>
standing in her way of reaching out to those as something useful for  <br/>
her.<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t make her read or write. But you can make her not want to.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Seven is really young for writing.  Just for the clarification, <br/>
reading and writing, while lumped together in school, are not <br/>
remotely the same thing.  Writing and spelling are not remotely the <br/>
same thing.  Writing could be the physical act of writing or it is <br/>
the act of putting ideas in the form of words.  Spelling is one <br/>
subset of those things, same with punctuation, grammar, etc.<br/>
<br/>
When my oldest, now 13, was 7, she had absolutely no interest in <br/>
reading or writing on her own.  I read to her a lot.  She drew <br/>
pictures a lot.  She played imagination games a lot.  It wasn&#39;t that <br/>
she couldn&#39;t do those things, she didn&#39;t have an interest enough to <br/>
do those things, other things were much more important at the time.  <br/>
I watched her develop her mind in other ways.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t DO anything to help her with writing.  Sure, play with <br/>
her, write grocery lists together, write her notes and leave them on <br/>
the bathroom mirror, get a huge chalk board and play restaurant and <br/>
put the menu up.  Those things are all writing and contributing to <br/>
writing while doing things more important to a 7yo.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Should I just get out of the way and let things unfold more on <br/>
 </span></blockquote>their <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; own, and not do anything else unless she asks?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not one or the other.  Yes, let things unfold, don&#39;t hinder the <br/>
process, focus on what she actually enjoys doing.  Do things for and <br/>
with her, even things she doesn&#39;t ask for.<br/>

unschooling to really work well.  Be involved in real and meaningful <br/>
ways to your daughter, not just in readin writin and rithmetic.  <br/>
Those are schoolish goals, and somehow have become your goals in your <br/>
thinking.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling really works best when the goal is to create happy and <br/>
stimulating environments that learning takes place.  Lest there be <br/>
confusion, that learning that is taking place doesn&#39;t have to be what <br/>
looks like school.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter went from not writing ANYthing until about 11 or 12, to <br/>
writing stories, poems, journals, and lots of them.  She types more <br/>
than she writes, yet her handwriting is decent enough to read.  Her <br/>
grammar is good, her spelling is awesome, and she uses punctuation <br/>
and caps in appropriate places.  All this was learned without any <br/>
formal lessons.  In order for it to happen &quot;I&quot; had to get rid of the <br/>
notion that it was more important than all the other cool stuff that <br/>
she was doing and learning.<br/>
<br/>
Focus your energy on what your children are into right now, what they <br/>
like right now and expand their worlds in those things.  If they like <br/>
games, play more games, if they like adventure walks, do more of <br/>
those.  If they like playing dress up, give them more outfits to <br/>
explore.  Young childhood is such a fleeting moment in life, why make <br/>
it boring and dull by inflicting children with adult held notions of <br/>
what is big and important for them to do and know.  Give them what <br/>
they really want.</div>

<br/>
And it probably won&#39;t look like school, but after a few years it will  <br/>
look like something much better than the other teens have and know.<br/>
<br/>
The less schoolishness is put on young kids, the better learners they  <br/>
will become, and the more impressive teens and adults they will be.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The older my oldest gets, the more and more convinced that what we&#39;ve <br/>
done is working.  I have a teen that likes me, values knowledge, and <br/>
treats others kindly.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m completely convinced that letting kids play is/was the key to <br/>
unschooling working.  Both my girls are growing up in the same house, <br/>
but much differently.  We &quot;did&quot; a lot more when my oldest was young.  <br/>
We went to museums, took classes, did field trips, joined scouts, <br/>
etc.  Since my older daughter needs very specific kinds of things <br/>
now, my younger daughter often tags along.  The younger one isn&#39;t <br/>
doing age related stuff nearly as much as my older daughter, yet I <br/>
see her growing and expanding and becoming an awesome person.<br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;ve decided it&#39;s not so much the &quot;what&quot; that we do, but the <br/>
attitude in which we do it.  The whole wide world is open, just play <br/>
and enjoy it.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1172969101">Jenny--<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;ve gotten some awesome responses, so I&#39;m just going to say that my son <br/>
started reading independently at about 8 12/, and my daughter has just started, although <br/>
she and I read together--I read a chapter, then she takes over--at her request at 9.  She <br/>
kept saying that she wanted to learn to read, and I kept looking for ways to support her in <br/>
doing that, but it was clear that she really wasn&#39;t ready until now--she just didn&#39;t want to <br/>
be embarrassed in front of the neighbor kids.  <br/>
<br/>
Now that I&#39;ve been through two reading on their own it baffles me that teachers still think <br/>
that they &quot;teach&quot; reading.  Don&#39;t they have eyes!!??  The same process of the lightbulb <br/>
going off must happen for every kid that becomes an independent reader (vs. the kids that <br/>
just shut down).  They must know how little they really have to do with it--or do they <br/>
really think that without all the &quot;pre-reading drills and skills&quot; kids wouldn&#39;t ever get there <br/>
on their own?<br/>
<br/>
My son did go to a bit of school, but my daughter didn&#39;t, so her process of growing was <br/>
almost, for me, like waiting for that rich batch of brownies to come out of the oven and <br/>
cool down enough to eat!  I was so excited to watch it play out for her--and it happened <br/>
just like all the other unschooling mamas said it would!!  Which has helped me to really <br/>
&quot;know&quot;--deep down rather than in my head--where the right path goes and how to <br/>
follow it.  It&#39;s like that feeling when you are driving and getting that feeling like you are <br/>
sure intellectually that you&#39;re on the right road, but there haven&#39;t been any signs in a while <br/>
so that doubt creeps in and then you see the sign or landmark and breathe a big sigh and <br/>
settle back feeling secure that you&#39;re headed the right way.  <br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s not even to say that I had any doubt, but reaffirmation can be a great feeling!  <br/>
And I find myself wondering if the TCS people that really try to follow it to the letter get to <br/>
have that feeling.  Do they see their kids interacting in the world in ways that give them <br/>
the confidence that  they are on the right path?  From the example of the boy in the <br/>
swimming toy that seemed entirely uninterested in interacting with an adult who was <br/>
trying to help resolve the situation I have to wonder.  (I realize that we don&#39;t actually know <br/>
that that mom was practicing TCS, but following the practice through seems like it could <br/>
easily result in such a situation.)<br/>

Perhaps it&#39;s like one of those layers of onion situations.<br/>
<br/>
When people say &quot;I read [whicehver] webpage last year, but...&quot; and I  <br/>
say &quot;Read it again,&quot; I think they might think I&#39;m accusing them of  <br/>
not having read it, but it&#39;s that after using the ideas a while, the  <br/>
description makes lots more sense.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever it is we&#39;re learning--crochet patterns, musical notation,  <br/>
using crutches, building a fire, making cookies-- hearing  <br/>
instructions (or reading them) makes VERY little sense at first.   <br/>
Later it makes more sense.  But after trying it and figuring out some  <br/>
things for ourselves, and then going back and looking at the  <br/>
directions, they come to life, in color, and they make 3-D sense.<br/>
