 </span></blockquote>It sounds like you&#39;re looking for a solution that will stop him from  <br/>
asking so you don&#39;t have to feel guilty for saying &quot;I need a break.&quot;  <br/>
If you look at your post you can see it&#39;s a justification for why you  <br/>
feel he&#39;s asking too much and why he should stop.<br/>
<br/>
Trying to control someone else can be not only frustrating but can  <br/>
turn into anger at the person we&#39;re trying to control.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s asking because he enjoys playing with you :-) (It *will*  <br/>
decrease with age.) But rather than trying to change him, change  <br/>
yourself. Tell him: &quot;I&#39;m going to take a break for half an hour  <br/>
because I&#39;m tired.&quot; While it&#39;s important for kids to know we take  <br/>
their needs seriously, it&#39;s important to take our own needs seriously  <br/>
too. (It&#39;s just really important to distinguish between our needs and  <br/>
the huge list of &quot;have tos&quot; we often accumulate.)<br/>
<br/>
You could brainstorm with him some ideas for things he can do for  <br/>
half an hour. You could set a timer and when it&#39;s done *do* go to him  <br/>
so he knows you&#39;re dependable. You could save up some of his favorite  <br/>
shows and put one one.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe when you&#39;re tired you can tell him &quot;I&#39;m getting tired. I&#39;ll be  <br/>
able to play for half an hour and then I need a break for half an  <br/>
hour. What kind of things can we come up with that would be fun for  <br/>
you to do?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What about other kids? What about paying an older homeschooler to  <br/>
play him for an hour or two a week.<br/>

<br/>
Is he wrong for needing time?<br/>
<br/>
Find another little kid.  It doesn&#39;t have to be a boy and doesn&#39;t  <br/>
have to be a five year old.  Find an after-school kid who needs care  <br/>
until mom gets home and trade straight out for him or her to play  <br/>
with yours.  Or pay him or her.  Or (what we did once with a  <br/>
&quot;daycare&quot; schoolkid) the mom pays you $6 (or whatever) and you give  <br/>
her half of it (or all of it) to play hard with your child during  <br/>
that time.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t replace all of you.  That gives you two hours (or  <br/>
however long).<br/>
<br/>
Find slightly younger kids who need care.  Find things they can do  <br/>
together but don&#39;t leave Lukas alone with that other child, be there.<br/>
<br/>
Find a family with more than one.  It will be hard for you to bring  <br/>
their two or three into where you only have one, but when he&#39;s at  <br/>
their house they&#39;ll have a blast!  That one shouldn&#39;t be straight  <br/>
across, but proportional, like twice as much, he&#39;s at their house.   <br/>
Sometimes, when they&#39;re over, do a project.  Home-made play-dough, or  <br/>
painting, or something you set up that they can do for a while, and  <br/>
when they&#39;re tired of that they can go play outside.<br/>
<br/>
Things like that should be done for him.  The play is how he&#39;s learning.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It really will! Ray was like this at Lukas&#39; age - he needed another <br/>
person to interact with most of the time. Now he&#39;s 13 and while he&#39;s <br/>
still very much a &#39;people person&#39; he doesn&#39;t clamor for attention.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This was sooooo important for me. I really think it ties in to some <br/>
of the other issues you are having with Lukas, too. As long as I was <br/>
trying to find solutions that changed Ray we were at odds much of <br/>
the time, and with Ray that meant regular screaming, hitting <br/>
meltdowns. Yikes. The more I accepted Ray for who he was the more I <br/>
was able to look for ways to meet his needs *and* mine (as opposed <br/>
to his *or* mine).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2102336826">One thing you might try is to let him help you with things that really need to be done.  My 4 year old daughter likes to help with laundry and dishes, but not with running the vacuum (she doesn&#39;t like the noise). She also likes to help make meals.<br/>
   <br/>
  Letting your son help provides him with an opportunity to be with you while also showing him the process of taking care of the household/family.  I think that it&#39;s fine to try and find an activity that he likes, and tell him that you need to rest or take a break and let him gradually get used to occupying himself for a short time.  Start out with maybe 5 or 10 minutes of playing with playdoh or trucks or something, and then come back to him.  Then increase the amount of time that you let him play by himself.  He will learn that you are going to come back and play with him and he will also learn that he can be creative and learn on his own.  Ask him what he did while you were resting, and he can tell you all about it.<br/>
   <br/>
  These are things that have helped me with my own children, but ultimately it will be a trial and error of developing a strategy that works for both of you without causing conflict.  Don&#39;t forget that children don&#39;t stay small forever, and one day you will look back and laugh and be thankful for the time you were able to spend with him.<br/>
   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-85725180">His need to play and be with you is the perfect side effect of good <br/>
parenting:) Embrace him. YOu are doing a good job. They grow up so <br/>
quickly. It&#39;s O.K. for you to need time to sit and recoup. I would <br/>
take naps with my two boys, no matter what. When I needed to sit <br/>
down for a moment to relax I would snuggle up with them and listen <br/>
to classical music and draw pictures with or for them. I find that <br/>
lying down versus sitting gives me more of an energy buzz.<br/>
I can totally relate. My boys are still like this. <br/>
Hang in there, your not alone. It&#39;s O.K. too to mess-up and get <br/>
frustrated, just be sure to apologize afterward. Gives them a chance <br/>
to respect you for being human. And trust me even the smallest of <br/>
child has a clue about respect:)<br/>

kid naps, either, from other comments she&#39;s made over time. That being <br/>

 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; time. &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here are a couple ideas:<br/>
<br/>
There is a book (book on tape) called Healing Trust by Thomas and in <br/>
it she explains how she gets neglected children that come to her home <br/>
as foster children (who desire constant attention) to play quietly <br/>
while she does housework.  If I remember correctly she specifies a <br/>
particular smallish area (the sofa, the play corner of the room, etc) <br/>
and gives the child only a couple choices (like Legos or coloring) <br/>
and then explains to the child that while they stay in the area and <br/>
don&#39;t talk to her they can play, but if they talk to her or leave the <br/>
play area, then she will know they want to help her.  She said to <br/>
expect in the beginning that they don&#39;t stay quiet or in the area for <br/>
more than a few seconds.  Be ready to cheerfully say &#39;oh good you are <br/>
ready to help me&#39; and then have them help with the chore you are <br/>
doing.  Then put them back and repeat the instructions.  Supposedly <br/>
after several repetitions the child starts to learn to play quietly <br/>
for 15 min, a half an hour even.<br/>
<br/>
What I would do in the past when I had a needy foster child (7 yrs <br/>
old) is tell her that I get an hour off and that for that hour she <br/>
can be in the same room but not talk to me.  I only did it once a <br/>
week and the first time was really rough on the child but after a few <br/>
weeks she (and the next one, I had two kids I did this with) would <br/>
play quietly while I took at break and watched TV.  Usually they <br/>
would play as close to the TV as possible so they would feel they <br/>
were still being watched over.</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes well this all sounds very Pavlovian. I don&#39;t understand why &quot;put them <br/>
back and repeat the instructions&quot; is needed.<br/>
<br/>
Why not just make doing the housework so much fun and enjoy the child&#39;s <br/>
company doing the tasks? Why not use this precious time to make connections <br/>
with these children who so desperately need to feel valued? Why not get ALL <br/>
the housework and possibly gardening done this way? It will probably take <br/>
longer, but think of the memories being forged.<br/>
<br/>
I have an only and we spend somewhere between one third and one half of our <br/>
time living on night shift where I am her only available playate. I do <br/>
understand the pressure to be the constant companion. It gets easier as she <br/>
gets older and has more inner resources of her own including her artistry <br/>
and computer games. She enjoys doing housework type activities too. Always <br/>
has.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &gt; What I would do in the past when I had a needy foster child (7 yrs<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; old) is tell her that I get an hour off &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I take my time off when Jayn(7.5) is sleeping either before she has awoken <br/>
or after she goes to sleep, or when she is out with dh. I try not to bring <br/>
strategies into my home that are &quot;really rough on the child&quot; if at all <br/>
possible.<br/>
