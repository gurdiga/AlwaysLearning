<div id="ygrps-yiv-2105613523">A couple of months ago, my girls and I watched &quot;Iron Jawed Angels&quot; on <br/>
HBO about the women who fought to vote.  It is an incredibly powerful <br/>
movie and made me realize how important it is to vote, especially since <br/>
I have four daughters who I want to grow up being empowered.  They&#39;ve <br/>
asked about the presidential election and what I&#39;m going to do.  My <br/>
problem is that I really hate following politics and often feel the <br/>
candidates are poor choices all around.  Without starting a big <br/>
political debate,  could anyone share with me a very general summary of <br/>
the primary candidates as to where they stand as far as education and/or <br/>
homeschooling?  Thanks.<br/>

<br/>
Start with googling the candidate&#39;s names to come up with their own websites.  Then look for local websites about the campaigns and voting.  Check your local and state newspapers websites.  They usually have articles on the candidates.  Check with your state or local homeschool group.  There are always a few politically active homeschoolers on the state lists.  Check the major parties websites for platforms.  Sometimes it matters more what the party line is, because candidates may vote along those lines even if they disagree.  Write or call your local candidates and ask them where they stand on issues that concern you.<br/>

C-SPAN has web-based tools for educators to use with students.  You might find something helpful there.  I think it is called C-Span in the classroom.<br/>
