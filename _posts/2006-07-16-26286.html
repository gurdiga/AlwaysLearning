<div id="ygrps-yiv-538263482">Need some help.  Starting to research more about tai chi due to the <br/>
sports/meditative/healing properties found within this martial art.  <br/>
Apparently, there are different forms of tai chi; and I want to find <br/>
out why one form would be better than another.  Websites, books, <br/>
opinions, etc., are all welcome.<br/>
