<div id="ygrps-yiv-1674879524">I hadn&#39;t thought of that when I posted it, but it was a *little* like  <br/>
seeing the face of Jesus on a tortilla.  A little bit.  The Pog of  <br/>
Turin.  Sort of.<br/>

<br/>
And I&#39;ve found some more pictures (even more) of Mary and Jesus and  <br/>
Grapes.<br/>

And the lyrics game word is &quot;Mary&quot; for most of the rest of Christmas  <br/>
Eve.<br/>
(Not necessarily that Mary, though if you click that you can look at  <br/>
lots of art very easily for a Christmas experience if you&#39;re not all  <br/>
totally overbooked for Christmas experiences which I suspect most of  <br/>
you are!)<br/>
