<div id="ygrps-yiv-2124703694">Someone requested that this be posted anonymously.  I wrote the subject line myself.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m concerned that I&#39;m not really meeting my 11.5 year old daughter&#39;s needs as well as I ought to be and I&#39;d be very grateful for some ideas from parents of children who&#39;ve passed this age. She is very much in adolescence now and has three younger siblings, for context. I found the thread on the facebook group about cocooning pre-teens very helpful ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/303347574750/permalink/10152848728039751/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/303347574750/permalink/10152848728039751/</a> ) and have a huge amount of trust in this need my own pre-teen has to be in her room socialising online with her friends. On the most part, she is happy and proactive about this. I wrote on here a while ago concerned that she wasn&#39;t very happy, but I don&#39;t feel that is the case at all now. However, she does, on some days (and I know we all do!) get a bit &#39;stuck&#39; (in her own words). If her friends go off-line, she sometimes finds it difficult to shift off the computer so just mooches around on YouTube. Sometimes she does this proactively. Sometimes this isn&#39;t a problem whether it&#39;s proactive or out of boredom. But sometimes, she tells me, she feels like she can&#39;t really get herself to do anything else and I&#39;m at a bit of a loss as to how to help her. I do a lot of going and watching with her, snuggling in her bed with her. Sometimes she doesn&#39;t want me to do that and is really quite resistant to my presence at all. I honour that and leave her, maybe bringing her a drink later on with no pressure. This is not about me - I am not pining for her affection or anything! But, when we talk outside of the situation, she says she wishes she had more in her life. So I suggest things, she becomes animated for about five minutes, and then she goes off the idea. <br/>
<br/>
An example: yesterday, after noticing that she&#39;d been a bit blue for a few days, I invited her out for a drink to a coffee shop with me and her grandma, who she&#39;s very close with. She was delighted but soon began to appear &#39;blue&#39; to me again, brushing my hand away if I touched her at all. Later, I said to her that I wanted to help her do the things she wants to do but that I can&#39;t read her mind. If she wants to play all day long online with her friends, I&#39;ll help her to do that. But I said I felt that she wasn&#39;t 100% happy right now. She agreed with me and, together, we came up with the idea of her trying some activities or hobbies - dipping her toe in the water, as it were, because she said she didn&#39;t know what she wanted to do but felt that she wanted to do something. She also said she felt her shyness held her back as it&#39;s harder to find activities that she can do with me present as she gets older. She then said she fancied learning a musical instrument or to sing. I asked her if she wanted lessons, and she became quite animated. We have a piano and various other instruments - learning to play something would be very easy. But within ten minutes, she&#39;d gone back to shrugging her shoulders and saying &#39;yeah, maybe&#39; at anything I said. Later on she came to me and said she wanted to try film-making if I could help her find somewhere she could learn that (she does some already, but wanted a course or something). But that idea quickly went off the boil too.<br/>
<br/>
I want to be clear that I don&#39;t want her to be interested in more things because I think she ought to be, but because she&#39;s said she wants to have other things going on in her life. She does have other things going on...but she&#39;s said she&#39;d like something regular that she can know is happening each week, or whatever. <br/>
<br/>
I feel a little like I&#39;m going round in endless circles with her; stuck, I guess. I&#39;m not sure she feels she really relates to me that well...I think I annoy her, although she&#39;s clear that she adores me too. I know this is also her age and maybe that&#39;s all I need to do - be with her (not necessarily physically), love her, be aware of her, and be patient for her getting through this demotivated patch. But I&#39;m concerned that maybe I&#39;m missing something; that there&#39;s something I could be doing (or doing better) that I&#39;m not. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be very grateful for any thoughts.</div>

<div>
<div>-=- But I said I felt that she wasn&#39;t 100% happy right now. She agreed with 
me and, together, we came up with the idea of her trying some activities or 
hobbies - dipping her toe in the water, as it were, because she said she didn&#39;t 
know what she wanted to do but felt that she wanted to do something. She also 
said she felt her shyness held her back as it&#39;s harder to find activities that 
she can do with me present as she gets older. She then said she fancied learning 
a musical instrument or to sing. I asked her if she wanted lessons, and she 
became quite animated. We have a piano and various other instruments - learning 
to play something would be very easy. But within ten minutes, she&#39;d gone back to 
shrugging her shoulders and saying &#39;yeah, maybe&#39; at anything I said.-=-</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Maybe she&#39;s desiring more&nbsp;activities outside the home or maybe she 
thinks that she &quot;should&quot; have more going on or that you&#39;d be happier if she had 
more things going on in her life.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>Rather than focusing on finding things outside of the house that occur on a 
regular schedule, I&#39;d try to find additional activities that she can pick up 
anytime and do at home. If you have musical instruments at home and she&#39;s shown 
an interest in that, maybe she&#39;d like an interesting video&nbsp;that she can 
turn on in the&nbsp;moment that it appeals to her. It might be more appealing to 
her&nbsp;not to have&nbsp;the big commitment to get ready, leave the house and 
be committed to a lesson for a predetermined amount of time.&nbsp; If she&#39;s at 
home &amp; she gets bored in 10 minutes then it&#39;s fine, she can look for 
something else.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div></div>
<div>-=- So I suggest things, she becomes animated for about five minutes, and 
then she goes off the idea. -=-</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Maybe she wants to please you or it sounds good&nbsp;in the moment but if 
the interest passes then that&#39;s ok.&nbsp; I have seen my daughter show interest 
in things many times that end up being just a passing idea.&nbsp; But when she 
really hooks onto something she becomes passionate and motivated and seems to 
have boundless energy for that endeavor.&nbsp; Until it passes and she&#39;s onto a 
new idea.&nbsp; Sometimes there is a period of restlessness or boredom in 
between and I try to help her brain storm new interests/activities.&nbsp; 
Usually she will not take my ideas but sometimes it helps trigger&nbsp;something 
else&nbsp;in her mind.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-=-However, she does, on some days (and I know we all do!) get a bit 
&#39;stuck&#39; (in her own words). If her friends go off-line, she sometimes finds it 
difficult to shift off the computer so just mooches around on YouTube. Sometimes 
she does this proactively. Sometimes this isn&#39;t a problem whether it&#39;s proactive 
or out of boredom. But sometimes, she tells me, she feels like she can&#39;t really 
get herself to do anything else and I&#39;m at a bit of a loss as to how to help 
her. -=-</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There is an incredible amount of interesting stuff on YouTube so maybe she 
&quot;just mooches around on YouTube&quot; (I&#39;m not familiar with that phrase but it does 
not sound like a very nice description) or maybe she&#39;s finding fascinating and 
interesting things on there.&nbsp; I suspect she&#39;s getting more out of the 
activity than your description indicates. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would try to find more options for her that are easy to reach for in the 
moment and that are appealing to an older girl but I would be careful not to say 
things that she could perceive as pressure to do or be more than she already 
is.&nbsp; I would work within myself on being ok with the idea that she is going 
through a period in her life where&nbsp;she sometimes&nbsp;feels blue, restless 
or angst.&nbsp; It is part of who she is right now and may not be something mom 
can jump in and fix.&nbsp;A warm, reassuring smile might be more welcome than 
suggestions at times.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-=- I feel a little like I&#39;m going round in endless circles with her; 
stuck, I guess.&nbsp; -=-</div>
<div>Going around in circles will make you dizzy.&nbsp; Stop circling around 
her.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-=- I think I annoy her, although she&#39;s clear that she adores me too. 
-=-</div>
<div>Do you need her reassurance on this point?&nbsp; Asking for her reassurance 
that you are ok and that she is ok could be annoying! :D</div>
