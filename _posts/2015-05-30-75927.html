<div id="ygrps-yiv-1484022298"><p><span>When we started unschooling, my intentions were to keep it strictly academic because I thought the principles would be impossible for my family because we have 11 kids- 10 still living at home. After about 6 months of unschooling, however, I really opened up to the idea of principles instead of rules and read everything I could find on the subject.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>Sometime in January, I slowly started transitioning, beginning with saying &quot;yes&quot; more, then doing away with bed times, and letting go of food restrictions. These changes were easy to implement. Our nights are much more peaceful without the arguments over staying in bed. What was once &quot;bedtime&quot; now usually consists of playing games, the kids making paper sculptures, and then falling asleep in the living room while watching &quot;Hercules- the Legendary Journey.&quot;</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p>The food principles were also pretty easy since I grew up being allowed to eat whatever I wanted because I didn&#39;t like my mom&#39;s cooking. :) I&#39;ve always been flexible in what my kids eat, although I did try to ration the snacks and milk for financial reasons. I&#39;ve recently stopped rationing the snacks, although it&#39;s been very expensive because my kids can easily finish off several bags or boxes of snacks in just a few hours. Last week my grocery bill was $503 for a week&#39;s worth of groceries. The milk is also an issue because they can easily go through 2 gallons of milk per day.</p><p><br></p><p>Which leads me to my first actual question: Does anyone have advice on how to keep the food bill down? Twelve people being supported by a welder&#39;s income can make things pretty tight, so there&#39;s no way I can afford $500 grocery bills every week.</p><p><br></p><p>My next question has to do with house keeping. Eliminating chores is the most recent transition we&#39;ve made, and I&#39;ve got to admit, I&#39;m EXHAUSTED. I understand that it&#39;s all a choice, but 12 people can make a bit of a mess. I actually do enjoy cleaning, but sometimes it seems neverending. This morning I woke up to a dining room filled with scraps of paper (not a problem), spilled drinks, melted freeze pops, and ramen all over the floor (all a problem, in my book). As I cleaned the dining room, the kids went out to the kitchen and spilled cereal everywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>This has been happening everyday. Right now I&#39;m reading &quot;How to Talk so Your Kids Will Listen...,&quot; so I decided to try problem solving with them. I explained that they&#39;re probably glad that they have more time to spend on doing what they like to do, and I like to see them happy. I then told them how much I miss doing things with them- painting murals, going to the park, going to the creek to find snakes, etc.- that we don&#39;t have much time to do anymore because I&#39;m always so busy and- honestly, worn-out from- cleaning up spills and food dumped everywhere. I asked them for any suggestions they have so that I could spend less time on these things. I swore I heard birds chirping at the silence that followed. They had no idea what to say. I tried to start it off by suggesting that maybe each person could try to clean up just after themselves, like putting their dishes in the sink or cleaning up any food or drinks they may spill. I also suggested setting the oven timer for 15 minutes everyday so we can work together to do a quick clean-up before their dad comes home. Again, no feedback (other than my 10-yr.-old joking that I could just put them all up for adoption.)</p><p><br></p><p>I would be truly grateful for any advice anyone has- whether you&#39;ve been through this or not.</p><p><br></p><p>Thanks so much.</p><p>Shelly</p></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-606086333">-=- I&#39;ve always been flexible in what my kids eat, although I did try to ration the snacks and milk for financial reasons.

<br/>
&quot;Recently&quot; is the important word.  <br/>
The desire/ability to &quot;finish off several bags or boxes of snacks&quot; is a condition created by the rationing.<br/>
<br/>
Find less expensive snacks.  Popcorn, maybe.  Buy on sales days.  Look for coupons.  Make cookies, or Rice Krispies squares.  <br/>
<br/>
If you go back to limits, you won&#39;t save money or improve health.  You&#39;ll create a reality in which food is valuable, and a chance to eat as much as one wants is a privilege that will be removed soon, so they&#39;ll eat more, faster.  And perhaps sneak it.  And maybe grow up to reward themselves with snacks.<br/>

There is no way I could maintain a $500 a week grocery bill for a long period of time. What I do is I buy what we need for meals. I ask for input on our menu, then I create a list. Then I leave the list out on the counter for the kids to add to. If I have extra or less money that week I will let the kids know. I also buy snacks for each kid. 3 of my kids do not snack a lot 2 of them do. What would happen is the 2 would eat all the snacks and there <span id="ygrps-yiv-800003673misspell-3" class="ygrps-yiv-800003673"><span id="ygrps-yiv-800003673yui_3_16_0_1_1433173708173_7792">wouldn&#39;t</span></span> be any for the other 3. I would set aside snacks for the 3 and add them back to the pile when I shopped again. (I have a snack tub in the cabinet that can be taken from at anytime.) That way they would have it if they wanted it. As the kids get older it is easier to allow for them to have their very own set of snacks. For my older teens I gave them a snack box for under their bed. I also do not make things equal. I think that is what makes it hard to have a large family. For example if 1 son needs new shoes I do not buy a new pair of shoes for everyone. Same goes for food. I pay close attention that everyone gets what they want and what I can afford. 2 of my kids love to bake. I buy sugar and flour in bulk and let them bake.

First off lower your standards for a while. I refused to ask my kids for help for a long time. I did everything by myself. After a while I began to feel abused by my family. I really felt left out because there is a lot of work to do just to keep the family fed and enough clean plates to eat off of. &nbsp;I pulled my oldest aside and talked with him about how I was feeling. He wanted our family to be radical unschoolers. He offered to help me out. I think the key is he wanted to help. We wanted to learn together. For a while it was he and I who took care of all the household needs. Then I began to ask the other kids for help. It was hard when they would so no. I would take a deep breath and do it myself, ask someone else or let it go. For what seemed like a REALLY LONG TIME my kids said no. During this time I kept telling myself my kids did not ask to be born. They and their upkeep are my <span id="ygrps-yiv-800003673misspell-3" class="ygrps-yiv-800003673"><span>responsibility</span></span>. Now 99% of the time when I ask for help they help. A lot of the time they offer help. Also for me I accepted the help they were willing to give. For example in the past if I asked my kids to clean their room I expected it to be cleaned to my standards, which are quite high. When I would ask them to clean their room and all they did was take out dirty clothes, glasses and garbage I accepted that as clean. I also look at each <span id="ygrps-yiv-800003673misspell-6" class="ygrps-yiv-800003673"><span id="ygrps-yiv-800003673yui_3_16_0_1_1433173708173_8176">child&#39;s</span></span> <span id="ygrps-yiv-800003673misspell-7" class="ygrps-yiv-800003673"><span id="ygrps-yiv-800003673yui_3_16_0_1_1433173708173_8224">personality</span></span>. My daughter loves her stuff. Where I see clutter she sees beauty. I embrace that now. She has stuff all over her walls. When I sit in there I look around and see all her friends and memories and love. Another example when one of my sons decided to take over his laundry he asked for 2 baskets. He keeps clean clothes in one and dirty in the other. I have always been laundry folder but the laundry would get behind a lot. His clothes are cleaned weekly by him and he always knows where his stuff is. I have accepted that he will not be hanging or folding his clothes and that is <span id="ygrps-yiv-800003673misspell-5" class="ygrps-yiv-800003673"><span>OK</span></span>. Now I have 3 kids doing their own laundry so I rarely get behind on that chore anymore.&nbsp;</div><div id="ygrps-yiv-800003673yui_3_16_0_1_1433173708173_5390" dir="ltr"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-800003673yui_3_16_0_1_1433173708173_5390" dir="ltr">The <span id="ygrps-yiv-800003673misspell-3" class="ygrps-yiv-800003673"><span id="ygrps-yiv-800003673yui_3_16_0_1_1433173708173_8548">transition</span></span> to radical homeschooling was bumpy for us and it was very much well worth it.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2073392727">Thank you so much, Tiffani, for so many great ideas. My kids who still live at home are 16, 15, 13, 10, 9, 7, 6, 5, 4, and 2. I happened upon your reply at the perfect time because I had just gotten done scrubbing dried ramen off of the bench- again- and I was pretty grouchy.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>I love the idea of the snack boxes for the older kids. I&#39;m definitely going to try that. My ridiculously high grocery bill last week was my own fault for failing to think things through. While I do always have a list, I chose to take 5 of my kids along with me to the store (I usually only bring 2 or 3), and I pretty much let them get anything they asked for. You live and you learn, right?</div><div><br></div><div>I love how your oldest willingly helps you. I haven&#39;t asked my older kids for help much because they really don&#39;t make much of a mess, and I would feel bad for having them clean something they didn&#39;t do. It&#39;s my younger kids (10 and under) who create the bulk of the mess, so right now I&#39;m still at the point of figuring out how to make things work. My standards have never been ultra high because with 10 kids it would be impossible to have a Better Homes and Garden-style house. Unfortunately, I&#39;ve been having trouble even keeping the house up to those standards, which basically consist of enough clean dishes for the next couple of hours, enough clean clothes for at least that day (it&#39;s harder than you may think), and no garbage or food thrown around. The one thing I did ask my 10, 9, and 7 yr. olds is if they could try to have a path cleared through their room so that their dad doesn&#39;t kill himself in the morning trying to walk through to get to the upstairs bathroom. They&#39;ve been pretty good about that.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Again, thank you so much. I&#39;ll definitely be referring back to your reply continually because there&#39;s so much great advice packed in there!</div></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-838903814">Go easy, when you ask for advice.<br/>
Sometimes (very often) the answers people get are to the questions they SHOULD have asked.  Or the responses are to potential problems the original poster hadn&#39;t considered. <br/>
<br/>
Even if the suggestion doesn&#39;t apply to the original poster, it might be useful for other readers.  So don&#39;t bat ideas away.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I was obviously joking, and if my husband would have made a joke like that about me, I would have laughed because it was a joke. I make my kids monkey platters, which I found on Sandra&#39;s website, all the time, but my children don&#39;t take that to mean that I think they are monkeys. I was just making light of the situation.-=-<br/>
<br/>
#1, boiled down, that says &quot;don&#39;t criticize me.&quot;<br/>
#2, LOTS of jokes are mean, and the &quot;i&#39;m just joking&quot; defense is the rallying cry of bullies.  I&#39;m not saying this was an instance of bullying, but that bullies use that defense.<br/>
#3, the monkey platter has a history, from us seeing monkeys at the zoo being given a platter of cut-up fruit; don&#39;t twist that to defend yourself<br/>
<br/>
Alex Polikowsky (anyone who gets a response from Alex should sit up and pay attention, because she knows what she&#39;s talking about) responded to this:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;Hopefully, it won&#39;t be too long for the &quot;feeding frenzy&quot; to slow down.&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Alex wrote this, which is worth repeating:<br/>
______________<br/>
<br/>
I hope you were trying to be funny when you write that, but If you were I want to point out that it was not successful.<br/>
How would you think you would feel if your husband said something like that about you? Even jokingly!<br/>
Your kids are not sharks or animals.<br/>
<br/>
The moment you don&#39;t see your kids as animals in a feeding frenzy when eating anything they want or enjoy, that is when you can start creating a peaceful environment where there is abundance and peace around any time of food. Where there is no stress around how much and what they eat.<br/>
Where your children can feel secure that their choices of what and how much they eat are going to be seriously taken in consideration and not something that may be taken away again.<br/>
________________<br/>
<br/>
A &quot;feeding frenzy&quot; is caused by deprivation, followed by sudden opportunity.  <br/>

Part of creating a more peaceful environment is being aware of the amount of &quot;just joking&quot; that is accepted in mainstream interactions.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Your kids are not sharks or animals.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Children will be respectful and respectable when they have been respected.<br/>

<br/>
Yes.  Children don&#39;t really have a choice if when they choose the parents indicate &quot;WRONG&quot; like the gong show (no matter how subtly the disapproval is, the kids will know).<br/>
<br/>
-=-Where your children can feel secure that their choices of what and how much they eat are going to be seriously taken in consideration and not something that may be taken away again.-=-<br/>
<br/>
The calm needs to live deep in the parents.  It might take a while, but belittling the children during the process is the opposite of helpful.<br/>
When parents are unaware that they&#39;re belittling children, it will be more difficult for unschooling to thrive.<br/>

<br/>
Very often when someone uses another person&#39;s phrase, she&#39;s using the other person&#39;s emotional charge to go with it.<br/>
If it&#39;s NOT the case, it&#39;s still worth considering using one&#39;s own carefully chosen words instead of &quot;stock phrases&quot; (pulled whole from one&#39;s subconscious/history).<br/>

<br/>
Just because there&#39;s more than one truth doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s no such thing as bullshit.<br/>
<br/>
If someone seems disrespectful and needs to be explained or justified, it&#39;s VERY MUCH worth considering making a choice the next time that is clearly, fully, cleanly respectful and friendly, supportive, kind.<br/>

<br/>
-=-As an example, &quot;feeding frenzy&quot; would not be a derogatory term in our house. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Language can only be stretched so far.  When a phrase has a negative connotation, that taint can&#39;t be washed off it completely.  Defending a phrase as though it would not and could not ever be derogatory in a particular house is false.  It isn&#39;t something one person has the power to guarantee.<br/>
<br/>
Over the past 25 years I&#39;ve been reading about and discussing unschooling I&#39;ve seen lots of negativity defended.  For good reasons, I&#39;m uninterested in the idea of providing and maintaining a forum for people to defend it here.<br/>
<br/>
-=- A feeding frenzy could easily describe our crew if ravenously hungry-=-<br/>
<br/>
Why not say they&#39;re eating enthusiastically?  They&#39;re happily devouring all the food you put out for them?  Maybe that the same old food tasted great because they were hungry?<br/>
<br/>
There are thousands of things one could say without using &quot;feeding frenzy.&quot;  People do not &quot;feed.&quot;  Fish do.  Pigs do.  Carrion birds feed on dead animals.  <br/>
People eat.  They dine.  They lunch, they brunch, but they don&#39;t feed.  Sharks do, though.  In a frenzy, when there&#39;s blood, people say/believe.<br/>
<br/>
Words are wonderful, and they mean what they mean, rather than what someone pretends to hope they mean.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My question is:  Why is it okay to have strong right vs. wrong opinions of the words used by parents who write to this forum...-=-<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/clarity">http://sandradodd.com/clarity</a><br/>
<br/>
Because without being clear and precise and thoughtful and aware, crap can pass for thought.  Recitation, rote, half-remembered misunderstood platitudes can take up space that would be better filled with new understandings of what helps unschooling work well, and what can harm or prevent progress.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-...when we wouldn&#39;t dream of expecting our children&#39;s thought processes to mirror our own?   This is asked respectfully and with a desire to hear and learn.   -=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not asking people&#39;s thought processes to mirror my own.  I AM asking people to make mindful choices about what they say, and think, and do.<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m not anyone&#39;s mom here.  The only butts I ever signed on to wipe were my children&#39;s.  They are a limited set of three humans, whose lives have been shared generously by them, to help other kids&#39; lives be better.  There are dozens (hundreds over the years) of families whose lives have been laid out for other unschoolers to see.  Not everyone can, should, will or needs to do that, but those who are able and willing to share make a profound difference for every family affected by ANY change in either parent who meets them, reads about them, hears them speak.   None of them want to parent other parents.  They want to help other intelligent adults become kinder and more open parents to their own children—parents who don&#39;t belittle their children with ill-chosen (or unchosen) words.<br/>
<br/>
Any time you don&#39;t think of two things and choose the better one, you have acted thoughtlessly.<br/>
Each time you speak, or write, without thinking what the best words and phrases will be for the situation (speaking to children, writing here, thanking a partner) you&#39;ve spoken thoughtlessly.<br/>
<br/>
People will not inspect anyone&#39;s home.  There&#39;s no report to file, no test to take.  This will be between you and your families.  <br/>
But advice given here, or questions or comments, are all put on the table under the bright light of unschooling.  That&#39;s the purpose of the discussion and has been for thirteen and a half years, 75000 (seventy-five thousand) posts ago.  I&#39;m not planning to change directions now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1864659221">Thank you, Alex.  I added what you wrote here:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/mindfulofwords">http://sandradodd.com/mindfulofwords</a><br/>
<br/>
I edited a bit.  Others might not realize it, but Alex isn&#39;t a native English speaker.  Having lived in the U.S. for a long time, she&#39;s full of idioms but still makes the odd error here and there. :-)   But I LOVE that she keeps up with the discussions and contributes, because she&#39;s thoughtful and alert.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I thought I was clear and having gone to law school I did learn a lot about how words can make a huge difference.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think the precision of legalese, of law-writing and interpretation, and of contract law, is about what else something might mean—whether it&#39;s ambiguous or not.<br/>
The clarity of writing about belief and emotions is different.  Our subconsciousness can express itself without our conscious mind hearing or seeing it.  Our super-ego can insert messages from long-dead relatives (maybe even a couple of generations back if they were quoted by our parents, grandparents, aunts or uncles).  <br/>
<br/>
We all know from the scripted conversations around us that it&#39;s possible to &quot;communicate&quot; without really thinking or listening (to ourselves or the other person).  <br/>
Hi!  What&#39;s your name?  What school do you go to?  Do you like your teacher?  What&#39;s your favorite subject?<br/>
Hey, how&#39;s it going?  How&#39;s your mom?  It&#39;s been so hot lately, huh?  Did you see the game?<br/>

I&#39;ve been trying so hard to do the *right* thing, but it seems like I keep getting it *wrong*. I&#39;ve spent quite a bit of time reading up on gentle parenting and unschooling. I finished Joyce Fetteroll&#39;s site, am about halfway through Sandra&#39;s site (alphabetically along with most of the links at the bottom), and have purchased and read every unschooling book I could get my hands on. My oldest is almost 22, so I&#39;ve been parenting traditionally for a long time. It&#39;s going to take a little while for me to transition, but the important thing is that I really want this for my children and am determined to make it work.</span></div><div><span class="ygrps-yiv-1673709230Apple-style-span" style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);"><br></span></div><div><span class="ygrps-yiv-1673709230Apple-style-span" style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);">***</span><span class="ygrps-yiv-1673709230Apple-style-span" style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);">What happened before you lifted limits?&nbsp; Were there spills before unschooling?&nbsp; What did you do about them?&nbsp; What has changed?&nbsp; Why has it gotten so challenging that you feel that there is no longer any time to do all those fun things you first listed above?***</span></div><div><span class="ygrps-yiv-1673709230Apple-style-span" style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);"><br></span></div><div><span class="ygrps-yiv-1673709230Apple-style-span" style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);">Yes, there were spills, but the kids had to clean their own messes (unless they were too little). And it has gotten challenging because it really is a lot of work for one person. Before we started unschooling principles, I would straighten up in the morning and do some laundry, the kids and I would do whatever we had planned (or not planned) for the day, I would make lunch at 12 and tell them what we were having. If they didn&#39;t like it, they were free to have something else, but if I needed to make it, they would have to let me know while I was already in the kitchen. Then at 1 we would all work together at whatever household tasks were ours and clean up so that my husband would come home to a half-decent house. This usually took around 15 minutes- 30 minutes at the most.</span></div><div><span class="ygrps-yiv-1673709230Apple-style-span" style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);"><br></span></div><div><span class="ygrps-yiv-1673709230Apple-style-span" style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);">Now, it&#39;s a bit different. Since we don&#39;t have our 1:00 cleanup time, I try to keep the house up throughout the day by myself. It&#39;s a big difference going from around 9 people working together to 1. Not having a set lunchtime also really throws things off.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1159566459">-=-I was actually reading &quot;How to Talk so Kids Will Listen & Listen so Kids Will Talk.&quot; It&#39;s from a section on problem solving. It specifically says ...-=-<br/>
<br/>
So you want rules?  A script?  Then that&#39;s a good book for you.<br/>
If it doesn&#39;t match what people are recommending here, it&#39;s because I&#39;ve recommended for twenty years for people to make a decision each time they speak or act, based on principles, rather than on rules.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/rules">http://sandradodd.com/rules</a><br/>
<br/>
-=- I&#39;ve been trying so hard to do the *right* thing, but it seems like I keep getting it *wrong*.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Then stop looking for &quot;right,&quot; and look for &quot;better.&quot;<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/parentingpeacefully">http://sandradodd.com/parentingpeacefully</a><br/>
<br/>
-=- I finished Joyce Fetteroll&#39;s site, am about halfway through Sandra&#39;s site (alphabetically along with most of the links at the bottom), and have purchased and read every unschooling book I could get my hands on. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Joyce&#39;s site can be finished.<br/>
Mine can&#39;t be.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad you explained how you&#39;ve measured, though.  (alphabetically)<br/>
Alphabetically would refer to the list on the lefthand at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschooling">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a><br/>
I made that list a long time ago, and it&#39;s heavier on the A-L part than the M-Z part.  Even then, it&#39;s fewer than 200 pages.  The site has over 1500 pages.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t look to &quot;finish&quot; or to read every book.   Look to use a few ideas to make your life better, and then maybe add another idea or two at a time.<br/>
And even if you DO finish Joyce&#39;s site (for example) or read a certain book... it will look entirely different after a year of unschooling, and different again after two or three years.<br/>

But unschooling doesn&#39;t work that way. Stop reading for a bit and try being more present in each moment. Try looking at every moment and considering which response will be the better one to make. Not the best one, not the right one, but the better one.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span class="ygrps-yiv-1203352906Apple-style-span" style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;"><br></span></div><div><font class="ygrps-yiv-1203352906Apple-style-span" color="#3f3f3f" face="Georgia"><span class="ygrps-yiv-1203352906Apple-style-span" style="font-size:13px;">I&#39;m noticing I&#39;m feeling tempted to give you ideas to manage a situation like you cited, but I feel as though you may take it word-for-word.&nbsp;</span></font></div><div><font class="ygrps-yiv-1203352906Apple-style-span" color="#3f3f3f" face="Georgia"><span class="ygrps-yiv-1203352906Apple-style-span" style="font-size:13px;"><br></span></font></div><div><font class="ygrps-yiv-1203352906Apple-style-span" color="#3f3f3f" face="Georgia"><span class="ygrps-yiv-1203352906Apple-style-span" style="font-size:13px;">If you&#39;re feeling like you&#39;re put upon and stuck in what is feeling like an endless loop of housework, sometimes the better option would be to say &#39;not now, sorry&#39; with love than to do the thing feeling pissed off and miserable. In the meantime, rather than reading everything you can get your hands on, read the most relevant things to what you&#39;re stuck on right now - what is getting in the way of you making better unschooling choices. For instance, in this situation, I&#39;d suggest working through Sandra&#39;s page on &#39;service&#39;...slowly. As you said, changes in thinking patterns takes time.&nbsp;</span></font></div><div><font class="ygrps-yiv-1203352906Apple-style-span" color="#3f3f3f" face="Georgia"><span class="ygrps-yiv-1203352906Apple-style-span" style="font-size:13px;"><br></span></font></div><div><font class="ygrps-yiv-1203352906Apple-style-span" color="#3f3f3f" face="Georgia"><span class="ygrps-yiv-1203352906Apple-style-span" style="font-size:13px;">http://sandradodd.com/service</span></font></div><div><font class="ygrps-yiv-1203352906Apple-style-span" color="#3f3f3f" face="Georgia"><span class="ygrps-yiv-1203352906Apple-style-span" style="font-size:13px;"><br></span></font></div><div><font class="ygrps-yiv-1203352906Apple-style-span" color="#3f3f3f" face="Georgia"><span class="ygrps-yiv-1203352906Apple-style-span" style="font-size:13px;">Incidentally, now that I do stuff for my kids with joy and a genuine desire to help them carry on with their busyness, and now that I&#39;m lovingly clear and honest when I can&#39;t (like when clearing up baby poo is the current priority) or don&#39;t want to just yet (like if I just want to finish my complicated row of knitting first) (but when I keep those times to a minimum), my children actually help out a lot. If I can&#39;t help, I offer to tell them how they can do it themselves so they can get it sooner than they would if they waited, or I ask a nearby sibling if they can help (of course it&#39;s cool if they say no -on the whole they say yes, I find). So I don&#39;t really recognise this picture of a family where mum does absolutely everything alone.&nbsp;</span></font></div><div><font class="ygrps-yiv-1203352906Apple-style-span" color="#3f3f3f" face="Georgia"><span class="ygrps-yiv-1203352906Apple-style-span" style="font-size:13px;"><br></span></font></div><div><font class="ygrps-yiv-1203352906Apple-style-span" color="#3f3f3f" face="Georgia"><span class="ygrps-yiv-1203352906Apple-style-span" style="font-size:13px;">But it takes time and trust-building and not doing things for your kids with resentment and an authentic desire to do things for your children to help them do more of what is joyful (ie. What they&#39;re learning from). And it takes letting go of the idea of a co-operative family where children help out a lot being your goal. Your goals should be your children having enough time to do the things they love and changing your own thinking so that helping them get that is a joyful thing for you as their mum. These are principles which you can use in each moment to help you make a better unschooling response.&nbsp;</span></font></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><div style="font-size:75%;color:#575757;">Sent from Samsung Mobile</div></div></html></div>

<br/>
Just because someone suggests a certain book might be helpful, in response to a particular question, does NOT mean that ANYONE said &quot;THIS BOOK IS THE BIBLE, and if you follow it you will not need any other books—just do what it says without thinking, and you will have eternal life.&quot;<br/>

Seriously.  Being defensive and blaming other people because things aren&#39;t going better might be some people&#39;s biggest problem.<br/>

<p dir="ltr">Feeding frenzies are normal for some animals, and not for others. What&#39;s important to my mind is what it means in your mind when you use the phrase. Sandra and Alex are pointing out that it has a connotation of scarcity and then over-abundance. If we go out for too long without snacks, we definitely have feeding frenzies when we get back but I don&#39;t view them as something that I hope will end soon. I view them as a particular type of eating and hope I have enough food! </p>
<p dir="ltr">So to me, the giveaway is in wanting it to end. Something seems out of balance-the kids aren&#39;t doing what *you want* them to do. *That&#39;s* the place to look for the disconnect. How do *you* stop wanting them to do sonething different, and is there a real or perceived scarcity of resources that can be remedied?</p>

There are a few other things that don&#39;t help, either, but indiscriminate ANYthing is a problem, when one should be learning how to think clearly and to see directly.<br/>

<br/>
But anyplace can be a starting place.   With &quot;Don&#39;t do what you don&#39;t understand&quot; as a motto, don&#39;t read what baffles you.  <br/>
<br/>
Another thing about reading is that there is school-style &quot;reading&quot; which is moving your eyes left to right, line by line, until the end of the page or chapter is reached and then looking up the answers if anyone asks you.   For school, that&#39;s great.  For learning to do something, or for figuring out how to move from being a same-old plain-old parent to a mindful unschooling parent, it is as worthless as anything could be.   <br/>
<br/>
And another way to look at is:  Nobody cares how many books you&#39;ve read about riding a bicycle if you can&#39;t ride a bicycle.<br/>
