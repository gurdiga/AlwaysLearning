&lt;&lt; &gt; Trying to think but can&#39;t lift a synapse. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Some time ago, there was a short &quot;filler&quot; film on Discovery Channel (I<br/>
think) which showed a mouse swimming around in a tank of water, searching<br/>
for a platform in the tank where it could rest.  The experiment had to do<br/>
with learning; the mouse would be taken out and put right back in, over and<br/>
over.  The result was, with each repetition, it took more time, not less,<br/>
for the mouse to find the platform.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
OOh yeah!  <br/>
<br/>
And sometimes, though Encore is my favorite game, it comes the point where I <br/>
just don&#39;t care.   <br/>
<br/>
I love museums, but I learned when I went to England, and confirmed later <br/>
when I had ten days (one day doled out at a time, van in the shop, &quot;we&#39;re leaving <br/>
tomorrow,&quot; for Ten whole days) in Washington DC, and I saw all the <br/>
Smithsonian, and the Library of Congress, and then started going to the Library of <br/>
Congress to read every day that...<br/>
<br/>
I learned that I can get museum sick.  Really feeling an urge to get the heck <br/>
out.  I could be standing looking at the world&#39;s biggest intact silver vein <br/>
(or whatever very cool thing) and think nothing but &quot;french fries&quot; or &quot;I wonder <br/>
if it&#39;s raining? I&#39;d rather be standing in the rain than looking at one more <br/>
priceless, unique-on-earth, incredible thing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So now that you tell the story of the poor swimming mice, I think if they put <br/>
the mouse in there too many more times, he might just rather sink and drown <br/>
than find the platform.   Had I been forced to look at more museum stuff <br/>
against my will, I could have come to the point that I learned not to see it at all, <br/>
and then I would be looking at those Revolutionary War guns and thinking, <br/>
&quot;Well, if the rifles wouldn&#39;t fire, I could throw myself on the bayonette,&quot; <br/>
<br/>
. . .and that makes me think of school.<br/>
