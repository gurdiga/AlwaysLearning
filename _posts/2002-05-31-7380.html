&lt;&lt; Perhaps without that experience, you wouldn&#39;t have pointed quite so many <br/>
people or in quite so drastic a way, towards unschooling.<br/>
It all worked to bring about the way you help people now...so it was <br/>
important. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Probably.  And so with the same pointing that points toward unschooling I <br/>
HAVE to point away from a curriculum.  I &quot;just say no&quot; to requests for me to <br/>
help find a curriculum the same way I&#39;d just say no if someone was asking me <br/>
to lend them illegal weapon and some rubber gloves and a ski mask to pay a <br/>
visit to the Circle K.<br/>
<br/>
Extreme perhaps, but if people choose a a curriculum it won&#39;t be because I <br/>
helped.<br/>
<br/>
But here&#39;s the behind-the-scenes peek:  <br/>
I think a curriculum can work okay in some cases.   I could have really gone <br/>
for something like that myself when I was a teenager, and would have done it <br/>
myself without anyone making me or having to help me much.  My objection is <br/>
the the abuse of materials by parents who know diddly about human development <br/>
and learning.  It pretty much amounts to abuse of the kids, then, at some <br/>
point (sometimes the very first moment and ever thereafter).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like the arguments against teaching.   I teach all the time.  I teach <br/>
when I speak at unschooling conferences.  I teach a dozen thirty-second <br/>
lessons a day around here, whether it&#39;s how to use Comet cleanser or how <br/>
apostrophes work.   But I think it&#39;s like playing jazz.  First people need to <br/>
really learn to play the instrument, to operate the equipment.  And THEN they <br/>
can improvise.   And &quot;the equipment,&quot; the basic instrument of unschooling is <br/>
to be able to see and trust natural learning.   Until that&#39;s internalized and <br/>
can be played in the dark, by ear, not even thinking about it, teaching will <br/>
too often result in disruption of the process, and will erode the learners&#39; <br/>
ability and confidence.<br/>
<br/>
Even well-intended unschoolers can do that kind of damage to learning and <br/>
confidence that school-at-home families can do if they don&#39;t guard against it.<br/>
<br/>
Pam Sorooshian and I were having a chat the other day I wish I had saved, but <br/>
maybe we can reproduce some of the ideas.  (Pam&#39;s about to leave town for a <br/>
week and some, but might not be gone yet.)   It concerned the idea that <br/>
unschooling is a spiritual ...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m out of a noun.  A spiritual endeavor?   That when you get comfortable <br/>
with unschooling it&#39;s the same as some of the descriptions of spiritual goals?<br/>
<br/>
(Feel free, anyone to jump in if a useful phrase comes upon you!!)<br/>
<br/>
What I think it might be is a philosophical position involving awareness in <br/>
the moment.  That&#39;s not common in this culture.  We reserve most &quot;philosophy&quot; <br/>
and &quot;religion&quot; to religion.  <br/>
<br/>
There are people who &quot;study philosophy&quot; who don&#39;t even seem to have a <br/>
philosophy, or who don&#39;t seem to know philosophy is an actually useful thing. <br/>
 They can tell you all about Greeks and Germans and worldviews, but they&#39;re <br/>
making their own daily decisions thoughtlessly.   They studied the study of <br/>
philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
So here comes something which can (doesn&#39;t have to, but has the potential to) <br/>
turn into a lifestyle and &quot;practice&quot; which does kind of resemble mindfulness <br/>
and right living.<br/>
<br/>
The definition has to be discussed constantly not because we&#39;re not sure of <br/>
it, and not just because there are always newcomers, but because it&#39;s the <br/>
examination of the ideas and our beliefs and actions that creates the <br/>
understanding which forms the basis of the relationships within the family.  <br/>
<br/>
When a new situation comes up here, I run back through all the &quot;rules&quot; and <br/>
principles we&#39;ve used before to try to apply it to the new situation.   Marty <br/>
has left without telling me a couple of times.  Not far, and not for long, <br/>
but on what basis do we make policies?  Who am I being if I&#39;m really grumpy <br/>
at him, instead of just letting him know WHY it concerns me and asking him to <br/>
discuss his plans before he leaves, and give us a chance to say it&#39;s not a <br/>
good time because we were planning to go somewhere as a family, or whatever <br/>
it might be.  But I know a flexible agreement about the comings and goings of <br/>
a teenaged boy will last longer than an absolute set of rules and curfews and <br/>
limits.  Putting a big boy in a small box is an invitation for him to find a <br/>
bigger box somewhere else.   But I learned that from having positive results <br/>
from giving him more than usual freedom when he was four, and six...</div>

compartmentalize nearly everything we do.  This seems like an unnatural state <br/>
to me.  Everything from learning, to food, to marriage, to one&#39;s life&#39;s work, <br/>
to death is isolated, dissected, and  - in the process- denuded of its beauty <br/>
and depth.  Unschooling seems to me to be a natural way of living life.  <br/>
Learning is not divided into discrete subjects.  We learn every day with our <br/>
mind, heart, and our spirit.  If that doesn&#39;t smack of the Divine, I&#39;m really <br/>
on the wrong track!  It&#39;s interesting - if you read creation legends (from <br/>
any belief system, not just Judeo-Christian), there is no exhortation to <br/>
instruct our children intellectually.  We are meant to teach them to live, <br/>
and to live well.  This sounds like the unschooling philosophy to me.  <br/>

Sandra sent me off on a quote hunt...Thoreau wrote in Walden, &quot;There are<br/>
now-a-days professors of philosophy but not philosophers.&quot;   Google sent me<br/>
to some really great quote sites if anyone is interested in Thoreau.<br/>
www.quotegallery.com and www.chesco.com<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s one to pique your interest: &quot;How could youths better learn to live<br/>
than by at once trying the experiment of living?&quot;<br/>
