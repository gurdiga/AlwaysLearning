I would love to hear more about how you&#39;ve cultivated this <br/>
relationship.  Has it always been this way, or did you have rough <br/>
patches?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Always been this way. We&#39;ve always &quot;clicked&quot;. I know I&#39;m lucky---especially <br/>
to have it with my first-born. I&#39;ve always tried to treat him the way I wish <br/>
someone would treat me. I remember what it was like to be five and nine and <br/>
thirteen and....<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s very agreeable and compliant---and so am I, to a degree. And we&#39;re both <br/>
risk-takers: at his age, I was jumping five foot fences on my horses <br/>
(sometimes what parents don&#39;t know won&#39;t hurt them! &lt;G&gt;). Cameron likes jumping off <br/>
buildings and out of windows. I&#39;ve taken a few pictures of his doing this (at his <br/>
request)----but most times I&#39;d rather not know it&#39;s happening. The skating <br/>
can be dangerous too---and it doesn&#39;t help that he likes to watch clips of those <br/>
NASTY falls the skaters take!-----EEEEW!   But the difference is: he knows I <br/>
won&#39;t &quot;forbid&quot; it; he knows I used to do it too (not the skating and <br/>
jumping----but dangerous stuff, and I hated to wear my helmet too, when riding!); he <br/>
knows that, if it REALLY disturbs me and if I ask him to stop or back off, he&#39;s <br/>
gone too far for MY comfort level and he respects that. He&#39;ll quit---for the <br/>
moment. He also understands that Duncan is still little (7), and some common <br/>
sense is good around littl&#39;uns.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have any &quot;rules&quot; about what he can do or not do. Most of his friends <br/>
do though. I think that helps a lot---seeing the silly rules that other <br/>
parents put on their kids. That beach scene you were talking about----he would have <br/>
known how uncomfortable it made me (because I would tell him! &lt;g&gt;) and come <br/>
in--- I think, because he knows that under &quot;normal&quot; circumstances, it&#39;s OK by <br/>
me. I would never arbitrarily say that he must come in. He would do it because <br/>
I would be afraid for him. I don&#39;t know, Patti---I guess it&#39;s just a genuine <br/>
concern for each other? We&#39;ve somehow &quot;agreed&quot; not to hurt each other?<br/>
<br/>
I liked Sandra&#39;s example of Kirby&#39;s driving. Cameron has his license too. I <br/>
have NO problem with his driving: he&#39;s very responsible and safe. When it DOES <br/>
bother me is when he&#39;s picking up friends (not very responsible friends who <br/>
seem to like to take advantage of him...and US, because we&#39;re so &quot;permissive&quot;!). <br/>
I worry that they&#39;ll talk him into stupid stuff or whatever. He&#39;s getting <br/>
less and less naive---and less trusting of them. That makes me feel good! &lt;G&gt; <br/>
Nothing stops the worry, though! <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know that there&#39;s a secret formula. I think we just &quot;click&quot;. I KNOW <br/>
that he would have been crushed had I been a more authoritative parent----he <br/>
just can&#39;t handle that. He has a &quot;soft temperament&quot; (to use dog-trainer-speak! <br/>
&lt;g&gt;). I think it helps that I LIKE him. I&#39;m genuinely DELIGHTED to share a <br/>
house with him----not to mention our lives!<br/>
<br/>
My other son is more of a challenge for me. He&#39;s more like his dad. I have to <br/>
work a little harder with that relationship. But I&#39;ve gained a bit of <br/>
confidence the first time &#39;round, so that helps! &lt;g&gt; And if you want it bad <br/>
enough,..... &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s how my best moments have come, from remembering, from giving, from <br/>
treating my kids as the most important thing, even if just for  a moment or an <br/>
hour.<br/>
<br/>
When I see parents who want to live their lives as though they hadn&#39;t had <br/>
kids, who relegate their children to a small part of life/time/house/thought, I <br/>
see the children BEING small, or finding their bigness elsewhere, getting their <br/>
attention from others outside their family, and then their relationship to <br/>
their parent becomes one of landlord/caretaker/adversary.   Hostility can&#39;t help <br/>
but be there.  Resentment both ways.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-556647235">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
My wife called me and told me our daughter said, this morning, &quot;I want daddy to work at night while I&#39;m sleeping.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I work and my wife stays home with her, and we are going to let her direct her own shooling. That said, I would like to be more available to her during the day. I wonder how others have handled this. What kinds of jobs have more flexible schedules. What kinds of jobs can be done at home, at night, etc? Any thoughts on this? I have experience as a web developer but there is no money in that (contrary to common opinion) and by the time I am a sulf-sifficient freelance writer, she will have moved out. Ha.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
Danny<br/>

Is there a Kinko&#39;s near where you live?  Before you<br/>
laugh, I used to work at a Kinko&#39;s and found the<br/>
experience wonderful.  The company is great, the work<br/>
is fun, and, most important, they&#39;re open 24 hours and<br/>
they are always looking for people to do all the<br/>
shifts (there&#39;s 8am-4pm, 4pm-12pm, and 12am-8am). <br/>
Best of all, they have a wonderful benefits package<br/>
that kicks in after you&#39;ve been there three months<br/>
(health, dental, VISION, retirement, stock options,<br/>
the whole shebang.)  With your background in web<br/>
design, you&#39;d be a shoo-in.  I&#39;m considering going<br/>
back to Kinko&#39;s after I leave my government job (11<br/>
years is long enough...) and I would love to work the<br/>
4-12 shift.  And be there with my kids during the day!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, and don&#39;t give up.<br/>
