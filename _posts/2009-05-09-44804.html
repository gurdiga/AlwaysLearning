<div id="ygrps-yiv-125939003">My own dear husband, Keith Dodd, said the other day that the internet  <br/>
should be more interactive.   Thoughts swirled through my mind,  <br/>
punctuated with the emotion of &quot;What the F*** are you talking about!??&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I got over it, and we laughed, but I did think that although I&#39;m  <br/>
supporting and participating and creating a great deal of interactive  <br/>
internet opportunity, it&#39;s not necessarily all well linked.<br/>
<br/>
The lyrics game word is &quot;wave.&quot;<br/>

There was an online chat yesterday and there will be one on Monday the  <br/>
11th.    It will be 3:00 in the afternoon Mountain Time, but other  <br/>
times are listed (with a countdown in days, hours and minutes) at<br/>

There will be a topic on Monday:  Comparisons and judgment:  good or  <br/>
bad?<br/>
<br/>
I have a blog specifically about the connections in life.  The current  <br/>
item is about corn bags (one of many put-plant-parts-in-a-cloth-bag- <br/>
and-heat-it) items, and a link to information about a much older  <br/>
practice of cherry pits in cloth bags, way pre-microwave.<br/>

If you click on the photo of the kirschsteinkissen, you&#39;ll see lots of  <br/>
websites in Switzerland and Germany selling them (probably to be  <br/>
microwaved, these days), and there&#39;s a link to a blog called Old &  <br/>
Interesting, history of domestic paraphernalia, household antiques in  <br/>
use.  There&#39;s a photo of what Holly did with an herbal eye mask she  <br/>
was given by an unschooling mom we know, in way of not heating it and  <br/>
not putting it on her eyes, but to aid her in dressing as a male rock  <br/>
star dressed glam-rock-girlie.<br/>
<br/>
This list itself certainly has the potential for being interactive  <br/>
(thought no members are ever required to write a single word), but  <br/>
there are many other ways to bask and steep in unschooling ideas and  <br/>
information and connections and practice being mentally gymnastic  <br/>
while finding new things you might share with your family and friends.<br/>
