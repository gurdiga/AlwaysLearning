&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;When fury comes it&#39;s probably better (physically, emotionally and<br/>
&gt; socially) for a mom to help a child turn that to something more<br/>
&gt; positive than to validate it. Sometimes anger isn&#39;t as &quot;valid&quot; as<br/>
&gt; other times.&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I seem to have trouble helping one of my kids with this - she gets<br/>
&gt; her feelings hurt and gets angry with me when I don&#39;t validate her<br/>
&gt; anger (at someone else/about something else) and pretty often doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; seem to want to move on to finding ways to be happier. I know that<br/>
&gt; deeper down, inside, she wants to be happier, but at the time she<br/>
&gt; seems to want to hold onto all the emotion. My question has to do<br/>
&gt; with how to help her turn fury into something more positive - without<br/>
&gt; validating it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And, of course, there may be times fury is valid, but I&#39;m talking<br/>
&gt; about times when a response other than big anger would be more<br/>
&gt; appropriate, useful, productive, lead to more happiness for herself<br/>
&gt; and others.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know there are no magic words, but it would sure help me to hear<br/>
&gt; how some of these kinds of conversations might go between other<br/>
&gt; parents and more emotional/intense older teens.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any other time, by the way, we&#39;re very close and loving and she&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; kind and caring and logical/rational person.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m glad we&#39;re talking about this!! :)<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes with Hayden&#39;s anger, I find myself at a complete loss...<br/>
I just don&#39;t want him to *be* angry; or worse, become an Angry Person.<br/>
His dad spent the most of his life angry and it didn&#39;t do him any favors...<br/>
he was about 25 (about the time we met and began dating) when he decided on<br/>
his own that he wanted a different kind of life, so there were two VERY<br/>
distinct parts of his life, pre-diana and post-diana.  I wish he were still<br/>
around for me to pick his brain about this...<br/>
After Hannah&#39;s death, when his anger was big and raw and real, I truly<br/>
didn&#39;t have any acceptable tools to help dissipate his anger (as I was<br/>
dealing with my own big, raw, real emotions).  I picked up some flower<br/>
essences for the both of us, for him I got Willow, which &quot;helps you find joy<br/>
when you&#39;re resentful and feeling sorry for yourself&quot; We talked about it<br/>
when he was calm, he was open to trying it, but he did once say he was<br/>
unwilling to take it because, &quot;if I let go of my anger, I will have to let<br/>
go of my memories of Hannah.&quot; Other days, he asked to have a few drops in<br/>
his water, to have throughout the day. Great insight into what was going on<br/>
in his head.  So we talked some more; actually I listened some more and gave<br/>
him a safe place to talk without my judgment or unsolicited input.<br/>
When anger comes now (we&#39;re almost 11 months past Hannah&#39;s death) I model<br/>
breathing, I come to him calm and empty (this won&#39;t be *the last straw*!!)<br/>
ready to hear whatever needs to be heard for him to feel comfortable moving<br/>
on.  We&#39;ve talked about the way anger feels and when it&#39;s productive to have<br/>
that feeling (the fight/flight concept) and when it&#39;s not (tough to find<br/>
what you&#39;ve lost when your mind is a red haze of anger).  I&#39;ve asked him<br/>
what he wants from me in those moments, he&#39;s said he just wants me to be<br/>
calm and not have a big reaction to his anger, just help him deal with it<br/>
(without my own whatever getting in the way).<br/>
We&#39;ve hit a groove lately :)  Just the other day, I ran in to help find the<br/>
remote when I heard his angstful cries of having lost it.  He said to me,<br/>
&quot;mom, I&#39;m not mad, not even frustrated yet, thanks for coming to help right<br/>
away.&quot; I&#39;ve noticed he&#39;s breathing more often when stuff is *beginning* to<br/>
get to him.<br/>
My biggest obstacle has been taking it personally.  My mind&#39;s voice that<br/>
says, &quot;see you really are a shitty mother, your kid&#39;s angry no matter what<br/>
you do&quot; was the first one to pipe up and scold me.  I can&#39;t be the parent I<br/>
really want to be, the parent I know I can be, if that&#39;s how I feel about<br/>
myself. (if I don&#39;t wanna play on my own team, who will wanna play with me?)<br/>
So, I sat down with that voice and kindly thanked her for coming, but her<br/>
services are no longer needed, please leave!  I&#39;ve invited other voices to<br/>
live there instead, voices that remind me to breathe through it, this is<br/>
*his* and not yours, reminding me we *are* a team and *WE* can figure this<br/>
out together.  That, I think, has made the biggest difference of all.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, this is one issue where my MIL watches me carefully... having had an<br/>
angry son herself, and not having had the tools to deal with him peacefully,<br/>
she&#39;s very interested in how I deal with Hayden.  It&#39;s obvious now that her<br/>
parenting style didn&#39;t necessarily *make* him angry, but nor did it leave<br/>
room for healing that anger.  My intention in my relationship with Hayden is<br/>
to give him the tools he needs to deal with all of his emotions in a way<br/>
that works for him, is productive in our life and preserves the trust we<br/>
have with one another.  I believe as time goes on, she will see the mighty<br/>
benefits of the road we&#39;re on.<br/>

realizing that anger is typically a secondary emotion. When I started <br/>
looking for what his underlying feeling was, and validating that, it <br/>
really helped him work through his anger and move towards finding ways <br/>
to be happy again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-540232500">I&#39;m interested in this topic too, and feel like I may have something<br/>
to offer, though I&#39;m not real clear what form that will take. Perhaps<br/>
I&#39;ll come clearer while I&#39;m typing. I&#39;m sorry to have erased all Pam&#39;s<br/>
and Diana&#39;s good words, but I couldn&#39;t decide what to leave in to<br/>
respond to and what to leave out, so it&#39;s all gone even though I<br/>
would&#39;ve rather left every single word there.<br/>
<br/>
Pam, I want to ask if your daughter has always been a passionate<br/>
person? Perhaps has always had a passionate *and* at times intense<br/>
personality? I&#39;m asking this too with only 13yrs of mindfully<br/>
parenting an, at times, intense and passionate daughter under my belt. <br/>
<br/>
My daughter is generally a calm, articulate, logical, sweet, caring<br/>
person, who laughs a lot, but there have been times when she&#39;s gone<br/>
through more intense, kind of unhappy and angry patches, always around<br/>
particular issues (sometimes of an existential nautre) that others,<br/>
myself included sometimes, would feel she &#39;should&#39; be able to find a<br/>
way to let go of. <br/>
<br/>
She has a keen sense of justice and injustice, which contributes<br/>
greatly to her ability to be a fine mediator, and to times when she&#39;s<br/>
completely outraged by something and despite all the great stuff she<br/>
knows and usually practices in her life, she can not or seems<br/>
unwilling to let it go of it in what I and others would consider a<br/>
more timely manner. <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s talked to me about finding my ability to be calm at such times<br/>
even more infuriating to her (though not always), feeling that I just<br/>
don&#39;t care and should really care more, so that exploring the thing<br/>
that is infuriating her is more likely to help her move through and on. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure how clear that is, or if it&#39;s relevant to your<br/>
situation... Maybe it will be clearer this way. The path through, for<br/>
us, is the one where we explore the infuriating passion in the same<br/>
way we would a happy passion. Which isn&#39;t the same as validating the<br/>
anger or fury, I don&#39;t think. Does that make sense? <br/>
<br/>
It has occurred to me, with the help of some wise words from other<br/>
mindful mothers, that my daughter might be an activist type of person,<br/>
and that she may well pursue a path in life consistent with the<br/>
passion and strength that are part of her unique self around issues<br/>
she believes important. I&#39;ve been able to move through the fears I<br/>
felt for her around that idea, and with that acceptance has come more<br/>
peace, for us both.   <br/>
