New today.  Pat Farenga just made this announcement on facebook, and I moved it to a more stable storage place. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Today is the official opening of the revised www.holtgws.com site. All the back of issues of Growing Without Schooling are online for free, as well as many articles, videos, and recordings by and about John Holt. I&#39;ve also added lots of books, research and support for unschooling teens (including college admissions) and children.&quot;<br/>
