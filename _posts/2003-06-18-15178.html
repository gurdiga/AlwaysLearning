&gt; &gt;Plain old Girl Scouts for older girls is NOT going away...those <br/>
&gt; &gt;choices are<br/>
&gt; &gt;still there. And girls can do both, if they like.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Only for the next couple of years during the pilot period. Then the <br/>
&gt; program materials that are less frequently utilized will be phased out. <br/>
&gt; They&#39;ve already SAID that the cadette and senior program materials are <br/>
&gt; used by only a fraction of current members - so they are clearly <br/>
&gt; already sitting on the chopping block.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The focus books are well-intentioned - but look at what&#39;s out there - <br/>
&gt; the first focus books for girls 11 to 17 years old.<br/>
&gt; Take Charge - talks about date rape and self-defense<br/>
&gt; Uniquely Me - Inside and Out -- it is about style and self-esteem<br/>
&gt; Uniquely Me - The Real Deal -- it is about having a PMA (positive <br/>
&gt; mental attitude) to deal with peer pressure<br/>
&gt; Looking In, Reaching Out -- it is about journaling and thinking about <br/>
&gt; one&#39;s own feelings<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are now a few other focus books - one on writing, one on track <br/>
&gt; and field, and one on traveling.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Contrast this to the Boy Scouts merit badges - on horseriding, <br/>
&gt; ceramics, camping, backpacking, carpentry, beekeeping, archery, drama, <br/>
&gt; engineering, and so on - dozens of them --- all REAL stuff to learn and <br/>
&gt; do and THEIR booklets have actual information in them to help the kids <br/>
&gt; learn.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The girl scout focus books take the place of earning any kind of merit <br/>
&gt; badges - the girls buy the booklets ($5 to $6 each) and read them and <br/>
&gt; do the activities (answer some questions, mostly) and then set their <br/>
&gt; own goals. When they&#39;ve achieved their own goals, they can buy <br/>
&gt; themselves a little charm - for another $4 or $5.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; (I LIKE the setting their own goals aspect, by the way.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But - I have absolutely NO interest in my 12 yo daughter being treated <br/>
&gt; to such obtrusive pop psychology by somebody who volunteers to be her <br/>
&gt; girl scout leader. We don&#39;t share the same religion nor values in many <br/>
&gt; areas and certainly not at ALL the same kind of approach to discussing <br/>
&gt; these kinds of things. And - much of the material is very very <br/>
&gt; anti-family. Even the most innocuous focus book - the one about writing <br/>
&gt; - there is a section about how to write a persuasive essay to convince <br/>
&gt; your parents to let you go to an all-night party. I found it very <br/>
&gt; offensive. The attitude that parents and kids are adversaries is <br/>
&gt; pervasive in the materials. It is assumed that all teenage girls will <br/>
&gt; have hostility toward their parents. There is a section in one of them <br/>
&gt; where it suggests that it IS possible that they could EVEN have fun <br/>
&gt; with their family. The message is clear - normal teenage girls don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; like their families.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There&#39;s more - but I&#39;ll stop ranting for now &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
&gt; I was a girl scout for all of my childhood and have been involved as an <br/>
&gt; adult for 14 years. I&#39;ve won council-level awards honoring my work for <br/>
&gt; the organization. I&#39;m sickened by the direction the older girls&#39; <br/>
&gt; program is moving - I was hoping to see MORE real content, not this <br/>
&gt; pandering to the worst of society&#39;s view of teenage girls. I&#39;ve got <br/>
&gt; THREE teenage girls (well - two plus one almost there) and this program <br/>
&gt; is so unsuitable for them and their friends that, just reading about <br/>
&gt; it, they were very very insulted and offended.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have no idea if teenagers who go to school will now flock to it or <br/>
&gt; not - although I&#39;d be very surprised if they&#39;ll bother. I cannot <br/>
&gt; imagine it appealing to girls with real lives and real senses of <br/>
&gt; themselves. At best, it is fluff.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -pam<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, I talked to Beth, my partner, who works for a GS council. What she said <br/>
is that different councils are working on how to implement this, but that the <br/>
intention is not to have regular GS go away. They did market research, <br/>
apparently, and found that among older girls that GS was not &quot;cool&quot;, and that&#39;s why <br/>
they left the program.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, the new program was designed so that it will not even mention that <br/>
it&#39;s a GS program. To me it also doesn&#39;t sound that thrilling. I dunno.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s going to get me more info. I&#39;ll pass it along if anyone cares.<br/>
