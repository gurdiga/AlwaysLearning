<div id="ygrps-yiv-761039924">oops, hit a wrong key and my post went off before it was finished,<br/>
sorry  :-S<br/>
<br/>
here is a talk by Steven Pinker that I thought was great:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/163">http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/163</a><br/>
<br/>
and here is an excerpt from an interview, that I also thought was<br/>
pretty good:<br/>
<br/>
------------------<br/>
<br/>
 the evolutionist: I&#39;ve always thought the standard social science<br/>
model presents a surprisingly pessimistic view of human nature -- that<br/>
people are entirely malleable and at the mercy of the rest of society<br/>
-- compared to the evolutionary psychology view in which people are<br/>
born high-spec, specialised problem-solvers just waiting to spring<br/>
into action.<br/>
<br/>
Pinker: It&#39;s pessimistic in the sense that it&#39;s fatalistic, even<br/>
though it&#39;s touted as the alternative to the fatalistic view that<br/>
everything&#39;s determined by our genes. It&#39;s fatalistic because it says<br/>
that the first few years of life set the course for the person&#39;s<br/>
entire existence, which I think is false. I personally find the<br/>
alternative comforting: the first few years don&#39;t put you on trolley<br/>
tracks that you travel the rest of your life. The child-moulding<br/>
theory has also led, ironically, to a perverse view of child rearing.<br/>
Judith Rich Harris is coming out with a book called The Nurture<br/>
Assumption which argues that parents don&#39;t influence the long-term<br/>
fates of their children; peers do. The reaction she often gets is, &quot;So<br/>
are you saying it doesn&#39;t matter how I treat my child?&quot; She points out<br/>
that this is like someone learning that you can&#39;t change the<br/>
personality of your spouse and asking, &quot;So are you saying that it<br/>
doesn&#39;t matter how you treat my spouse?&quot; People seem to think that the<br/>
only reason to be nice to children is that it will mold their<br/>
character as adults in the future -- as opposed to the common-sense<br/>
idea that you should be nice to people because it makes life better<br/>
for them in the present. Child rearing has become a technological<br/>
matter of which practices grow the best children, as opposed to a<br/>
human relationship in which the happiness of the child (during<br/>
childhood) is determined by how the child is treated. She has a<br/>
wonderful quote: &quot;We may not control our children&#39;s tomorrows, but we<br/>
surely control their todays, and we have the capacity to make them<br/>
very, very miserable.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(the whole thing is here:)<br/>

<br/>
Another reason for one to be nice to another.  It makes one nicer.<br/>
<br/>
Being a nice person has value in and of itself regardless of the  <br/>
effect on others.<br/>
