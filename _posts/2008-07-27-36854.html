<div id="ygrps-yiv-1038537981">Nice article!  I&#39;ve enjoyed the pictures posted over at Radical Unschoolers Network by someone who was at an Amy Steinberg concert at your house.  Beth & Kevin hosted a house concert for Amy last month, and it was great. <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m curious, are there any special neighborhood considerations to have a house concert?  Will has been trying to find venues here in Albq for some indy country acts he likes, but with the loss of his most likely bar/saloon this past February to a fire, he&#39;s pretty bummed.  I wonder if he could arrange a house concert -- our place isn&#39;t big enough, but both his girlfriend and his best friend live in houses that might be suitable.  I&#39;ll bet it hasn&#39;t even occurred to him that a house concert might be an option (he lives in a tiny apartment). <br/>

Technically, it&#39;s just a party. I think it&#39;s nice to warn neighbors of the possible parking <br/>
issues and stuff, but it hasn&#39;t been an issue here. I do know that&#39;s not the case in *every* <br/>
city--- some have restrictions and such. It&#39;s probably a good idea to ask &quot;the powers that <br/>
be&quot; whether that&#39;s the deal or not.<br/>
<br/>
There are several website about house concerts: .com, .org, etc. But the main one (that I <br/>
mined for info) now has a book for sale on how to host a house concert---$15, but just <br/>
two years ago, all that info was available free online. Bummer, huh?<br/>
<br/>
Ben&#39;s really into indy music, and most of the acts we host are &quot;Americana&quot; which is kind of <br/>
&quot;country-folk&quot;---and some are &quot;bluesy-folk.&quot; That&#39;s just the genre that finds house <br/>
concerts the most welcoming, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
People don&#39;t expect homes to be huge. &lt;G&gt; They expect to be a little cramped and snug. <br/>
We happen to have this bitchin&#39; deck, so we can handle more than most homes in town---<br/>
but NOT in our living room! &lt;G&gt; We had about 70 for Amy, but we were spread <br/>
throughout the yard.<br/>
<br/>
But if you call me, I can fill you in on particulars. I think it&#39;s a wonderful way to bring <br/>
music *literally* into your home. We get to meet the artists---up close and personal (most <br/>
of them spend the night with us)---and we get to meet other music lovers in town. I have <br/>
stretched my music tastes a bit and have found that I LOVE all the acts who have <br/>
performed here. I have lots of new friends! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
To bring it around to unschooling&lt;g&gt;, it&#39;s a great way for the boys to be exposed to <br/>
really good music in a warm, welcoming (non-smoky) atmosphere. Cameron has been <br/>
asked to sit in on several songs with different artists (just depends on their style and <br/>
songs and whatever). Duncan&#39;s not making the most of this...yet, but he will, I&#39;m sure, as <br/>
he gets older.<br/>
<br/>
I also feel that it gives *back*. We get nothing for these concerts. It actually costs us to <br/>
host them. BUT...my house gets clean once each month. &lt;G&gt; I get to try new recipes on a <br/>
regular basis. Locals music lovers have a sweet location to enjoy new music.  And we&#39;re <br/>
helping a future *star* along on his/her/their way. It&#39;s a wonderful evening for all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-737332417">Oooohh.  Lovely.  And very nice.  I grew up part of the time in VA and I<br/>
have very fond memories of the Indian (India) neighbors (Vergeese, probably<br/>
the wrong spelling), the Native American neighbors, going to their houses<br/>
and playing board games, eating the yummy exotic food.  Met a 7 year old<br/>
gentleman at the Finches (my dad was professor and Mr. Finch taught at the<br/>
same place.. community college) and we have not kept in touch my parents do<br/>
and he is a doctor now.  He always let us girls win every game and was the<br/>
perfect little host.  We lived in South Hill.  SC was such a shocking<br/>
departure from all that, but I grew to love the minifarm there anyhoo.<br/>
