<div id="ygrps-yiv-392483146">A few miles north of 80, just outside of Grand Island Nebraska, is the Stuhr <br/>
Museum of the Prarie Pioneer. The museum is cool, but the real fun is the <br/>
grounds. Buildings have been moved here from all over the surrounding area. Small <br/>
cabins. A whole railroad town. www.stuhrmuseum.org/<br/>
<br/>
Fort Bridger is just off of 80 not too long after you get into Wyoming. There <br/>
are restored military buildings and a reproduction of Jim Bridger&#39;s trading <br/>
post. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://wyoparks.state.wy.us/bridger.htm">http://wyoparks.state.wy.us/bridger.htm</a><br/>
Unfortunately, neither the museum or the buildings are open till May, but you <br/>
can walk the grounds.<br/>
<br/>
I think you can see cranes along the Platte River in Nebraska this time of <br/>
year. If they haven&#39;t moved on yet. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-247983518">There is Carhenge (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.carhenge.com/)">http://www.carhenge.com/)</a>in Western Nebraska, but<br/>
that might be a bit out of your way.  If you are going into to Omaha<br/>
Henry Doorly Zoo <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.omahazoo.com/">http://www.omahazoo.com/</a> is quite good--it has grown<br/>
in leaps and bounds since I was a child going around the zoo with my<br/>
little yellow elephant key that you would plug into a box and it would<br/>
start of an informative talk on the animal in the cage in front of<br/>
you. And the best possible place to spend a day is in Omaha, so long<br/>
as you can stand the smell of cigarette smoke, The Antiquarium<br/>
Bookstore. It has an incredible music store in the basement and books<br/>
and an art gallery upstairs and the nicest man in the world runs the<br/>
place.  Tom Rudloff and his sister started it years ago, and now he<br/>
sits in the front window in (well he used to) bear claw slippers and<br/>
welcomes customers and talks to friends and smokes cigarette after<br/>
cigarette.  So if you do buy any books there you&#39;ll know where they<br/>
came from for a while after.  Simon and Linnaea didn&#39;t really enjoy<br/>
the experience the last time we were in Omaha, but you may need to<br/>
have a disaffected quality, or at least a teenage sense of humor, to<br/>
really enjoy the Antiquarium.  It always feels a bit of home to me.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t find any good links to the Antiquarium.  It is mentioned in<br/>
a bunch of blogs and antiquarium.com gets you to a Bill Farmer<br/>
memorial.  Bill Farmer has a permanant exhibit at the Antiquarium.  <br/>
<br/>
It might not be any fun to drive a trailer into downtown Omaha, and<br/>
you may just be focused on the last leg of the journey to KC at that<br/>
point. There are parks along the Platte where you can camp like Eugene<br/>
T. Mahoney state park which is on I-80, I think.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll be back in the states this summer making the trek from Minnesota<br/>
through western Nebraska (my brother has 200 acres near Valentine) and<br/>
Colorado to Albuquerque and then back up through Wichita, so looking<br/>
through the sites in the area has me excited. <br/>
