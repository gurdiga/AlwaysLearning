<div id="ygrps-yiv-2039236806">I came in to sit in a safe(r) place. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Last week was just wild.  Three different online places, I was getting <br/>
jumped, by people who either knew nothing about unschooling (on the New <br/>
Mexico list) or people who were new to it and not getting it to work.<br/>
<br/>
Rough.<br/>
<br/>
And today, because of a private correspondence, I was going to look something <br/>
up about James Dobson&#39;s stuff.  Yeek.<br/>
<br/>
What I found was worse.  It was someone going on about how Dobson doesn&#39;t go <br/>
far enough, that he&#39;s a total wimp and violator of the Bible.<br/>
<br/>
So rather than stir a peaceful Christian neighborhood (there&#39;s a batch of new <br/>
participants at unschooling-dotcom who are Christian), I brought it here.   <br/>
It seems it&#39;s useful for activists and volunteer-types in general to know <br/>
these bizarre things sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
OH!  But first, I wanted to say that if any of you have favorite <br/>
anti-spanking testimonials or want to write me something, I&#39;m going to do an <br/>
anti-spanking webpage kind of like the video games page--links to donated <br/>
pages or other good sites, with enough information on the front page that <br/>
it&#39;s not JUST a list of links.  Not so much that people will be overwhelmed <br/>
and go away.  <br/>
<br/>
And another thing (I&#39;m not organized this moment):  below is also something <br/>
from the same article about Mother Teresa.  It seems really funny to me, but <br/>
then I remember the author was probably kinda frothing at the mouth just <br/>
thinking about it, and that unfortunately he&#39;s not an isolated nutcase.<br/>
<br/>
So on to Spanking Teens:<br/>
<br/>
(whole article is here:  <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/exposes/dobson/general.htm">http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/exposes/dobson/general.htm</a> )<br/>
<br/>
+++++quote starts+++++<br/>
<br/>
In the Q&A section of the book, one of the questions was &quot;Should teenage <br/>
children be spanked for disobedience or rudeness?&quot; Dr. James Dobson, the <br/>
self-proclaimed child-rearing expert, answered thusly:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No. Teens desperately want to be thought of as adults and they deeply resent <br/>
being treated as children. Spanking is the ultimate insult at that age and <br/>
they are justified in hating it. Besides, it doesn&#39;t work.&quot;<br/>
On what authority should teens not be spanked? -- Dr. Dobson&#39;s? And do we <br/>
govern our lives by what teens &quot;want&quot; or by what the Bible teaches? If teens <br/>
resent being treated like children, then they shouldn&#39;t act like children. <br/>
And if spanking is the ultimate insult for a teenager, then this is evidence <br/>
it must work very effectively in deterring the rebellious actions that bring <br/>
the rod. And finally, by saying &quot;it doesn&#39;t work,&quot; Dobson is calling God a <br/>
liar (cf. Prov. 22:15 -- Folly is bound up in the heart of a child, but the <br/>
rod of discipline will drive it far from him.)! God says spanking does work <br/>
(and He doesn&#39;t even give an age limit -- cf. Prov. 19:18 -- Discipline your <br/>
son, while there is hope; do not be a willing party to his death).<br/>
<br/>
                                    ------------------------<br/>
<br/>
(c) In the 11/89 issue of FOTF&#39;s Clubhouse magazine for children, a smiling <br/>
&quot;Mother&quot; Teresa was on the cover, and the lead article was entitled, &quot;Teresa <br/>
of Calcutta: Little Woman with a Big Heart.&quot; The readers of this magazine <br/>
were made to think that Mother Teresa was a genuine New Testament Christian <br/>
and that she was doing a great work for God through her Sisters of Charities <br/>
mission. &quot;Mother&quot; Teresa was, in reality, a New Age pantheist who considered <br/>
Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, and other religions all to be acceptable ways to <br/>
God. This is a great deception. She also preached the false sacramental <br/>
gospel of Rome and had given multitudes of people a false comfort by <br/>
encouraging them to place their hopes in such vanities as the Roman Catholic <br/>
mass and the Roman Catholic Mary. It is an abomination before God for Dobson <br/>
to feature this woman in his magazine.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Abomination.<br/>
He said &quot;abomination.&quot;<br/>
What a sad life for him.<br/>

God&#39;s table.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think I have anything useful to add to your spanking page, but I&#39;m<br/>
glad you&#39;re doing it and I&#39;ll be happy to have somewhere to refer people.<br/>
<br/>
I never know what to think about self-pleasuring foaming scary zealots, of<br/>
any stripe. On the one hand, as you said, it&#39;s almost amusing. I mean, how<br/>
many people can really sustain that kind of hatred for Mother Theresa??!! On<br/>
the other, because there are More Of These People Out There, it&#39;s not<br/>
amusing at all.<br/>

Maybe I don&#39;t need to do one!!<br/>
<br/>
(I was thinking of it being tied into unschooling, but seriously--maybe we <br/>
just need to send people there when it comes up  next time!)<br/>

I looked, but the tone and scope of it was too rough for me.  <br/>
<br/>
I just want to help unschoolers move toward being at peace with their kids <br/>
without having them listen to a recording of someone being spanked.  I have <br/>
those sounds in my head already.  Yuck.  Too rough for me, that website.<br/>

guess...<br/>
<br/>
I remember when I was looking at anti-spanking sites a years ago (during<br/>
misc.kids spanking wars) there was this definite subset of pages for and<br/>
by men who got their rocks off by spanking kids (or fantasizing about<br/>
it). Sometimes they&#39;d seem legit in the beginning (well, as legit as<br/>
pro-spanking sites can be) and I&#39;d be reading, and it would just get<br/>
sicker and sicker.<br/>
<br/>
I imagine those guys have all downloaded that recording and jack off to<br/>
it every night :-/<br/>

It&#39;s an option.<br/>
I opted not to click it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I imagine those guys have all downloaded that recording and jack off to<br/>
it every night :-/&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe.<br/>
<br/>
And there is a LOT of porn having to do with spanking and control.  I wonder <br/>
how much of it is rooted in childhood abuse?  (I don&#39;t want to study Freud&#39;s <br/>
followers to find out, just kind of idly wonder if in a culture without any <br/>
spankings or &quot;discipline&quot; whether there could ever possibly arise a bondage <br/>
and discipline subculture.)<br/>
<br/>
There was a guy who used to come to the AOL chats sometimes.  Same guy but he <br/>
would change his screenname.  And he would ask about whether we spanked or <br/>
not and if anyone did, could they write to him on the side.  Or he would come <br/>
in and say he had a daughter who wasn&#39;t being good and he wanted to spank her <br/>
but what did we think.<br/>
<br/>
People who hadn&#39;t seen him before would always very patiently try to reason <br/>
with him.  But he wanted to jack off.<br/>
<br/>
A couple or three years back, I heard he was calling homeschoolers from phone <br/>
booths or something, saying he was taking a poll or something.  Anyone <br/>
remember him?<br/>
