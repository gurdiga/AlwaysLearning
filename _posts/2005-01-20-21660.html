<div id="ygrps-yiv-248727539">This was a cool moment for me to realize how much Dan is learning <br/>
just being in the world.  He&#39;s almost 4 (on the 24th!) and our only <br/>
totally unschooled child, having done some school at home with Andy, <br/>
so he&#39;s the true unschooling testimonial.<br/>
<br/>
This morning, I used the word &#39;himself&#39; in a sentence.  Dan <br/>
corrected me, saying &quot;HISself, Mama.&quot;  I answered, &quot;No, it&#39;s <br/>
himself.&quot;  He asked, &quot;Why?&quot;  I thought about it for a moment, then I <br/>
saw what had happened.  He&#39;s already figured out that my and him are <br/>
different kinds of pronoun forms!  He was right, too.  If we say <br/>
myself (with my being a possessive pronoun) it should be hisself <br/>
(with his as the possessive pronoun).  The same is true of <br/>
themselves/theirselves.  Likewise, if himself and themselves is the <br/>
preferred usage, it should be meself, since him, them and me are all <br/>
reflexive (or is it prepositional?) pronouns.  <br/>
<br/>
I explained to him that I could see what he meant, but that what we <br/>
say is himself, and I&#39;m not sure why, just that it is.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve known for a while that he&#39;s the budding grammar nazi, but I am <br/>
constantly amazed by how much he learns just listening to us talk!  <br/>
It is so cool to watch unschooling work.<br/>

And &#39;herself&#39; just screws you both ways! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I had a huge knock-down-drag-out with a school-at-homer (doh!) on a local  <br/>
list a year or two ago. She wanted to know how I could teach my children  <br/>
English. I said just by talking with them. She was totally shocked! Of course,  her <br/>
posts were *full* of misspellings and grammatical errors. I insisted that my  <br/>
children would at least be reading/hearing *correct* English! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
