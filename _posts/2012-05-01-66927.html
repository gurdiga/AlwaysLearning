<div id="ygrps-yiv-1685597942">I&#39;m wondering if anyone here has experience with modifying a Wii gaming system.  My son (7) loves Super Mario, and would like us to modify our gaming system so he can have a level editor on it (to create his own levels).  For anyone familiar with Super Mario, it&#39;s the Reggie level editor.<br/>
<br/>
He uses all the level editors we can find online.  This next step of altering the Wii is more complex, and we&#39;re just getting started.  We&#39;re on a forum with a bunch of hackers, so I&#39;m also asking them if this process will cause any problems with other games, but I&#39;m wondering if anyone here has personal experience with it.  My husband is concerned that we might mess the Wii up, so right now we&#39;re in the information gathering phase.  Trying to strike a balance between keeping shared resources in working order and helping Dmitri explore.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1928674394">My son wanted to do that too.  My understanding is that once you hack it<br/>
you can&#39;t do any system updates, which means that there will be some games<br/>
that you cannot play.  If we do it someday we&#39;ll buy a cheap 2nd hand Wii,<br/>
I&#39;m concerned about messing it all up too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hello, we just picked up another second-hand wii console for Â£40 here in the U.K in GAME shop (they could even be cheaper elsewhere??)<br/>
Having another wii to work on and adapt may help aliviate the worries and reality of possibly messing up your current shared one. <br/>
Best wishes<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2146970041">We hacked our WII.  It was because we had too living overseas where the<br/>
only games accessible to us were pirated versions.  I do not recommend it.<br/>
 Wii has it so rigged that the second you update, (the games themselves<br/>
carry the updates, and unfortunately you cant tell which games have the<br/>
update) the thing freezes and can no longer be played.  Also as soon as you<br/>
do this you are out of warranty and the factory will not touch a hacked<br/>
system.  We learned this the hard way.  In the Middle East we could get it<br/>
fixed easy, but here we had to throw our system away!  Just a forewarning!<br/>
