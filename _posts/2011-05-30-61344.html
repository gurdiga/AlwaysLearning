<div id="ygrps-yiv-1388180171">Questioning college? Yes, we are, also. <br/>
<br/>
One of the most interesting of the Thiel fellows (to dd18 and I)is Dale Stephens, who just founded Uncollege. He left school in 6th grade and was unschooled. He recently dropped out of his freshman year at Hendrix College, dismayed by the lack of passion and curiosity in his fellow students. It&#39;s certainly not confined to Hendrix, though; he makes that clear. After winter break conversations with a friend from an Ivy League school who was also disappointed with the college experience, he began developing his idea. He now has followers from all over the world, as well as speaking engagements everywhere, and a book in progress. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been following Dale and Uncollege closely. His Facebook pages are Uncollege [education] and Uncollege [group]. We are currently enjoying reading all the links to articles questioning college and the very lively discussions.<br/>
<br/>
Also:<br/>
 <br/>
dalejstephens.com<br/>
<br/>
uncollege.org<br/>
<br/>
The questioning, doubting, and negative comments to articles about Dale or Uncollege will be familiar to many unschoolers. It takes a certain kind of early adopter / think-outside-the-box mindset to question the value of going to college. Most unschoolers have probably heard those same arguments against *their* alternate path out of K-12; most probably will &quot;get&quot; the idea of Uncollege. <br/>

Blake Boles is gathering up to do a zero-tuition college, and hangs out with unschoolers all the time, though he himself &quot;did school.&quot;<br/>

I think that will be a stepping stone for some people to accept the idea that some people live in the real world directly, without the need for college OR alternative college.<br/>

I really liked what Blake wrote on his blog....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-514779732">-=-&#39;walkouts&#39;-=-<br/>
<br/>
In India, would &quot;walkout&quot; refer to a younger person (who might be called &quot;a school refuser&quot; in some other places)?<br/>
Or is it a term for someone who opts out of going to the university, or leaves university studies?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m interested in getting other places&#39; terminology clear.   :-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a three-time graduate-school dropout myself.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1139583840">In India a &#39;walkout&#39; is one who refuses to go to university mostly, but it<br/>
is increasingly being used for adults who are refusing to be in<br/>
mono-dimensional jobs or careers and opting for multi diversity and living<br/>
without future savings and insurance and investments. I recently even heard<br/>
a new word called &#39;unjobbing&#39;!!!!<br/>
