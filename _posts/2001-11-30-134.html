<div id="ygrps-yiv-277224076">Oh, smokes. Just when I finally got most of the rocks out of our <br/>
homeschooling boat!  It has been a long road, but I&#39;ve finally gotten my <br/>
spouse to (mostly) trust our son&#39;s lead in his learning, and now I find I may <br/>
have been wrong!<br/>
<br/>
My son is 11 and loves math. Eats it up. Wallows in all levels of math books <br/>
like a horse in clover. Begs for algebra problems and &quot;engineering&quot; problems <br/>
from his dad. So I let him run with it (how not?). He&#39;s got a good handle on <br/>
most basic algebraic/geometry concepts. Is working on grasping the weird <br/>
stuff (how I always thought of trigonometry). Is dead set on learning <br/>
calculus so that physics will be &quot;easier&quot; (a notion he picked up in his <br/>
reading somewhere). And soon. <br/>
<br/>
Is it possible that letting him do this at this age might not be a good <br/>
thing? He loves the stuff.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the math addiction, he loves to read (omnivorous; even the <br/>
dictionary), build with his Legos robotics kit, and fool around with the <br/>
computer. Shows little interest in writing, although occasionally will <br/>
compose a poem or song (which he typically wants to type and keep in his <br/>
computer folder). He hates writing word things by hand, but he will happily <br/>
fill page after page with computations as a means of keeping track of where <br/>
he was in his thoughts. He loves math textbooks because he thinks of them as <br/>
fun puzzle books. He enjoys stimulating discussion on most topics, but would <br/>
prolly rather have his teeth pulled than take the time to write e-mails to <br/>
his beloved but far-flung relatives (he&#39;d rather talk on the phone).<br/>
<br/>
Should I really be steering him away from the algebra, etc., until he&#39;s 13 or <br/>
so? I&#39;m not being facetious: I really didn&#39;t know this might be a problem! <br/>
Help?!<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Wynn</div>

 </span></blockquote>If HE is truly initiating it, and enjoying it, then I&#39;d support him. I don&#39;t <br/>
see a problem.<br/>
Have you looked at Calculus By and For Kids? It is great for a kid like this <br/>
-- really interesting way of looking at calculus concepts -- meaty and <br/>
satisfying, imo. It does need someone else to fool around with it with the <br/>
kid (and fool around is what you do - it is play) -- but if you or your <br/>
husband have enough background and interest, you could do that or, if not, <br/>
you could maybe find someone who does.<br/>
<br/>
You know that forcing kids to learn to read is possible at 3 years old. It is <br/>
possible. But is it good for them? Do kids who are forced to read early turn <br/>
out later to be smarter, more competent, better readers? Do they end up <br/>
reading more or loving it more? NAH - educational researchers now have a TON <br/>
of evidence to the contrary.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, what if you DO have a child who simply soaks it up and <br/>
demands to learn to read at a very early age? I guess some people might say <br/>
we should prevent them -- but HOW? Take the books away? Divert their eyes <br/>
from print material? Dumb, right? So - I have one child who did this - truly <br/>
taught herself how to read before her 4th birthday. It is fine - at 14 she <br/>
still has some traits that make her unusual in the language/reading area. I <br/>
suspect that a kid who is DEMANDING and truly self-initiating advanced (and I <br/>
consider formal algebra to be advanced) mathematics at 11 years old will <br/>
always have some unusual traits in that area -- will be outstanding in some <br/>
related way even as an adult. I don&#39;t see anything more dangerous in <br/>
supplying a kid like that with what he wants than supplying my child with <br/>
books she could read, even though she was very young. <br/>
<br/>
BUT I would see that as REALLY different than trying to get my other children <br/>
to read at 4 years old - even if I did it really nicely and with a fun <br/>
reading program.<br/>
<br/>
Also - word of warning -- I had a mom telling me over a period of months how <br/>
her 10 yo son was like this - devouring math books -- she kept telling me how <br/>
much he LOVED Saxon Math and so on..... but one day I HEARD him saying <br/>
something like, &quot;PLEASE PLEASE can I just skip my math today and go to <br/>
Bobbie&#39;s house to play?&quot; Didn&#39;t sound like the kid had free choice in the <br/>
math department, to me. I started paying attention, and I noticed other <br/>
things where this mom acted like her son was initiating things but really it <br/>
was clearly her. I don&#39;t know if she believed it or was straight-out trying <br/>
to mislead other people into thinking it. Or, who knows, maybe the kid liked <br/>
it for a while, but the mom got overly excited and couldn&#39;t let it go when <br/>
the kid lost interest. <br/>

kids have the internal feedback to stop if they aren&#39;t processing<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s from my deepest faith in unschooling.  No on else, (no offense<br/>
meant to Cindy, who was generalizing), can specify the right or wrong<br/>
age for a certain child to learn a certain thing.  But the child himself<br/>
is drawn to select things that are right and set aside things that are<br/>
wrong.<br/>
<br/>
I just can&#39;t imagine a child choosing to approach math or music or<br/>
swimming in a way that would leave the kind of long lasting mental scars<br/>
that we&#39;ve seen school induce.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And I believe I said &quot;very few children&quot; are ready to learn formal algebra<br/>
at that point, not that no child is ever ready for it then.<br/>
<br/>
If a child picks up a math book and can&#39;t put it down and wants more,<br/>
the that child is ready for it.  My older son started algebra when he<br/>
was in the 6th grade - he did fine with it and enjoyed it. He won<br/>
first place in a statewide math contest in the 8th grade and did math<br/>
contests all thru high school (yes, he was in school.)  He doesn&#39;t <br/>
like really hard math now and avoids the parts of his field where it<br/>
is difficult.  Since his chosen field is astronomy, we are talking about<br/>
extremely difficult math too!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2001968215">Thanks, all, for helpful and reassuring input.<br/>
<br/>
Pam, do you have an author/publisher for Calculus for and by Kids? We haven&#39;t <br/>
heard of that one, and did not find that title in our library&#39;s ILL catalog, <br/>
but it sounds like it might be a good one. I had to LOL at the thought of <br/>
forcing Ledlie to do anything; seems like it would be quite an investment of <br/>
energy to force a child to do something. :^D (which is why I always supposed <br/>
that teachers look so wrung out all the time). <br/>
<br/>
Also, I guess if I could force him to do any one thing, it would be to clean <br/>
his room :^D<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also really enjoying the tongue-in-cheek discussion of math and belief in <br/>
God...<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
