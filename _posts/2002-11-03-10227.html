For those of you who have yet to appreciate the gorgeous Alan Rickman, and <br/>
only know him as Professor Snape with the greasy hair in Harry Potter, let me <br/>
list a few movies for you to pursue! <br/>
<br/>
-Galaxy Quest (well, maybe not... he wears a plastic alien forehead)<br/>
<br/>
-The January Man with Kevin Kline<br/>
<br/>
-An Awfully Big Adventure with Hugh Grant<br/>
<br/>
-Rasputin with Ian Mckellen<br/>
<br/>
-Dogma as Metatron i.e.. God&#39;s Voice<br/>
<br/>
-Close My Eyes<br/>
<br/>
-Quigley Down Under<br/>
<br/>
-Michael Collins<br/>
<br/>
-Sense and Sensibility he plays Colonel Brandon<br/>
<br/>
-Die Hard (oh my... but what a bad guy!!!)<br/>
<br/>
-Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves with Kevin Costner (is it me or... sigh, never <br/>
mind)<br/>
<br/>
-Blow Dry (didn&#39;t think this one was going to be very good... but it was <br/>
funny. Alan isn&#39;t seen much after the first third of the movie. but still <br/>
good.)<br/>
<br/>
-Truly, Madly, Deeply<br/>
<br/>
-Closet Land with Madeleine Stowe<br/>
<br/>
-Mesmer<br/>
<br/>
-Dark Harbor (Alan gets nekkid!)<br/>
<br/>
-The Winter Guest (Director) Beautiful, mostly black and white.<br/>
<br/>
-Bob Roberts with Tim Robbins<br/>
<br/>
-Judas Kiss (only see this if you are a huge Rickman and Thompson fan! They <br/>
are only in the movie for about 10 minutes.)<br/>
<br/>
Happy viewing!<br/>

Thanks for that. All my winter viewing sorted out now. Some <br/>
serious letching to be getting on with.<br/>
<br/>
I actually think Alan as Snape is quite cute....maybe its the long <br/>
black robes.....can&#39;t wait for the second film.<br/>
<br/>
And then a month later Its The Two Towers. More letching. <br/>
Aragorn...hmmm....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Shyrley the letch ;-)<br/>

I like the hair, the robes, and the intensity.  I don&#39;t think he&#39;s &quot;cute,&quot; <br/>
but &quot;cute&quot; isn&#39;t the only attractive thing in a person.  Hugh Grant is <br/>
&quot;cute,&quot; but also kind grating.  (But I like his movies, even though he seems <br/>
always to play the same kind of character.)<br/>

Sorry... I didn&#39;t even see that you had used the word cute.  I was just <br/>
thinking guys can be attractive without being the image of &quot;attractive guy&quot; <br/>
(cute).    Some of the most attractive guys don&#39;t photograph so well in <br/>
still.  Clint Eastwood is kinda ratty looking, but he can be sexy.<br/>

having Alan Rickman playing Snape gave all the mothers <br/>

Bear with me whilst I&#39;m hopelessly behind!<br/>
We&#39;re remodeling my mom&#39;s house and my remodel is starting <br/>
in the next few weeks.  I&#39;ve been spending time with my mom <br/>
shopping with her for stuff for her house.  She&#39;s also been <br/>
staying at my house and my spare bedroom is also where the <br/>
computer lives so not a lot of online time at the moment for me. <br/>
Tomorrow the septic co. is coming to install a new system.  <br/>
Thursday the fence guy is coming to redo the fence and make a <br/>
separate dog area (Yeah, I&#39;ll be able to plant some stuff without it <br/>
being dug up the next day!).<br/>
