<div id="ygrps-yiv-1338896452">Ok,  I should have been spading my garden and raking the leaves and<br/>
pruning the honeysuckles but the fall colors were so beautiful and the<br/>
sky was so blue today we just had to go for a hike.  <br/>
<br/>
Dylan came and wiggled into bed with me this morning after David left for<br/>
work, and he clamped his frozen little feet on me and scrambled around<br/>
some until he finally fell asleep.  I woke up later and he was gone.  He<br/>
got up when he heard the dogs, fed them, let them out, had his breakfast,<br/>
saved the last bagel for me AND made coffee.  How nice is that?<br/>
<br/>
So, when he said Aryel couldn&#39;t come over to play and he didn&#39;t have any<br/>
really good ideas about what to do and raking didn&#39;t sound like one of<br/>
those good ideas,&lt;g&gt; we found the binoculars, made a lunch and off we<br/>
went.  <br/>
<br/>
What a glorious day.  We are having an especially beautiful fall and so<br/>
collected as many colors of leaves as we could find.  We watched<br/>
acrobatic phalaropes fly in perfect formation.  We saw a herd of<br/>
antelope, and found some cool rocks.   When we got home Dylan had Tae<br/>
Kwon Do and learned two new kicks and two new poomses and came home and<br/>
folded the basket of laundry I didn&#39;t get to right away and helped me get<br/>
dinner.  <br/>
<br/>
I do still have that raking though...unless it&#39;s really nice<br/>
tomorrow...&lt;g&gt;<br/>

go for a hike too.  Peace, Lisa<br/>
