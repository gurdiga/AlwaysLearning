<div id="ygrps-yiv-145110772">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I recently ordered and read &quot;Homeschooling Reflections&quot; by Connie Colten.  I <br/>
believe Sandra Dodd wrote a comment for the back cover of the book, <br/>
recommending it.  At any rate, I truly enjoyed the book and wanted to let others know <br/>
more about it.  <br/>
<br/>
As I said to a good friend last week, there are so many families I admire <br/>
when I see how their families appear to function and how the children behave -- <br/>
eager to learn, interesting and interested in life, and, insecure person that I <br/>
am (that likely many of us are), I wish I could be a little mouse in the <br/>
corner and observe one of these families on a daily basis for a while to really <br/>
see how they function, day to day, hour to hour. <br/>
<br/>
And that is what I really enjoy about &quot;Homeschooling Reflections&quot; -- the way <br/>
Connie Colten allows us into her family in such an intimate and honest way.  <br/>
And what I learned was not the secret to perfect homeschooling or unschooling, <br/>
but rather, just that it works, not perfectly, but best, when we trust our <br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
