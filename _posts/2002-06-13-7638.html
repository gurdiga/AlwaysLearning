&gt; I must have been VERY young, but I can remember actually getting our first<br/>
&gt; phone.  It was a princess style with a light up dial and the number was<br/>
&gt; 714-539-4843.  I can&#39;t remember the last few numbers we&#39;ve had but that one<br/>
&gt; has stuck with me always<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Our first phone number was Geneva 83885. You dialed GE83885 -- but all the <br/>
numbers had words at the beginning like that.<br/>
<br/>
The local cab company was Garfield 83885. It was on all the cabs, driving all <br/>
over town. I knew our phone number from listening to my parents say: &quot;NO - <br/>
this is GENEVA 83885 not GARFIELD 83885 and we aren&#39;t the taxi company.&quot; <br/>
Sometimes people would argue and my dad would finally say, &quot;Okay, we&#39;ll send <br/>
a cab now,&quot; and just hang up.<br/>
