<div id="ygrps-yiv-1775509240">I had to share this. <br/>
<br/>
DS is into skate boarding and graffiti painting presently. We&#39;re going <br/>
to buy some spray cans so that he can do some grafitti painting in the <br/>
back garden. While waiting for his dad to get ready, I passed DS a <br/>
coffee table book showcasing works from the grafitti artist Banksy&#39;s, <br/>
which I bought a few weeks ago.  <br/>
<br/>
DS was sitting there reading this book, describing Banksy&#39;s work to me <br/>
and hubby, reading out the text next to each and every photographs. DS <br/>
was telling us how long each grafitti pieces were displayed before it <br/>
was painted over by the local authorities. Later part of the book, <br/>
tells of Banksy sneakily hung his work alongside some fantastic <br/>
artwork in very famous art galleries. DS recognised most of the <br/>
Banksy&#39;s defaced portraits, hung next to the real thing. He started <br/>
asking questions like where is the Louvre, where is Vietnam (relating <br/>
to one of pictures) and where is Barcelona and many more. DS excitedly <br/>
recognised a photograph of the National History Museum and suggested <br/>
we should go there again because he likes that place.  <br/>
<br/>
I took this chance to point out an unschoolng moment to hubby &quot;There <br/>
you go, your son is reading, doing geography, learning about art and <br/>
will be doing art lessons later once we get the spray can&quot;<br/>
<br/>
DS heard what I said and replied &quot;I&#39;m not reading mum, I&#39;m just <br/>
looking at pictures and yes, it&#39;ll be soooo cooool when we get the <br/>
spray cans later. I&#39;ll need black, white, red, green and orange&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
LOL! He is right, he is not reading. He&#39;s only absorbing everything by <br/>
looking. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for letting me share my story. Hope you had a lovely <br/>
unschooling day too.<br/>
<br/>
Big hugs and best wishes,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-194907675">A couple weeks ago, Karl ran across a game on one of the TV websites (I<br/>
forget which one) marketed for older kids.  It had a balloonist traveling by<br/>
air to many different parts of the world and in Carmen Sandiego style asked<br/>
you to find a certain place on the map/world he was flying over.  It was<br/>
just a 5 or 10 minute thing then he went on to something else.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday we opened a some cheese slices (those thick slice cheeses by<br/>
Cabot.. yum) and Karl used the feet on my keychain figure of R2D2 to &quot;cut&quot;<br/>
the cheese into shapes and held it up to ask me which country it was.  When<br/>
I answered he&#39;d say &quot;that&#39;s right!&quot; just like his games tell him when he<br/>
gets the answer right (pretend play, which he does a lot of).<br/>

Hi Katherine,<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if the game you mentioned has anything to do with the Jules <br/>
Vernes Around the World in 80 days. We found this game which is very <br/>
addictive. It tells the story too. <br/>

<br/>
We find this website very interesting too. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-88206507">Oh those look great. I do think it was the around the world in 80 days<br/>
thing.  When Karl wakes up (it&#39;s noon and he&#39;s sleeping longer than usual<br/>
today), I will show him these links you&#39;ve sent.  Thanks!<br/>
