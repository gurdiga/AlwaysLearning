<div id="ygrps-yiv-1105870566">I am just a lurker here, but this thread speaks much to what we are<br/>
experiencing lately.  I, also, get so frustrated at the lack of<br/>
spontaneous play allowed for children. <br/>
<br/>
Even in the realm of homeschoolers, I get back-to-school blues due to<br/>
the mostly school-at-home thinking.  I would not and could not change my<br/>
way of thinking, but there is a great deal of disparity between what I<br/>
think would be &#39;ideal&#39; for my children&#39;s learning.  Our family is rather<br/>
isolated due to unschooling, but we would benefit greatly from more IRL<br/>
interaction with similar-minded people.  I know my children would<br/>
benefit from more interaction with other children; but I just haven&#39;t<br/>
found it much.<br/>
<br/>
And I am finding myself likely to have great distances form in some<br/>
(more)friendships because they are choosing the school route, which<br/>
pulls them away from us by time, as well as by way of thinking.<br/>
<br/>
I am trying to think creatively about this.  I have talked with the kids<br/>
about possibly forming some sort of &#39;club&#39; where they meet monthly to do<br/>
crafts, or to play cards, or board games, etc. <br/>
<br/>
It is just a trying time, thanks for the space to rant a bit,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We are dealing with similar issues.  Although we have a few sort of unschooling families to do stuff with, I&#39;ve realized I need to increase my efforts to find more kids to be around during the school day.<br/>
<br/>
We are going to try this: Each week we will plan something we want to do - bowling, mini-golf, park, etc., and announce it on our local homeschool list, inviting others to join us.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t mean we won&#39;t do other things or only do one thing a week, but we will make an effort to plan some things a few days in advance so that others will be able to join us too.  Hope that makes sense.  Your idea sounds great too.<br/>
