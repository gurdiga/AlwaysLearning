<div id="ygrps-yiv-555423780">Dear unschoolers,<br/>
<br/>
I have subscribe to this list and the first post/digest were<br/>
numbered 25.  Today I got the number 107 digest.  Many posts were<br/>
exchanged but I have not had the opportunity to read most of<br/>
them.  I have left the Unschooling.com mailing list to join this<br/>
one.<br/>
<br/>
We have been unschooling our 7 yo in a neiborhood were we seem to<br/>
be the only homeschooler family. HSing is not yet a choice to<br/>
many in Japan. But we have been very busy and extremely happy<br/>
with our choice.<br/>
<br/>
Next week, daughter and I are going to Sao Paulo, Brazil, where<br/>
my mother and my sister are and where I was born.  We will come<br/>
back to Tokyo, the birth place of husband and his family, in the<br/>
beginning of April to resume our family/uschooling life.<br/>
<br/>
I will unsubscribe fm this list tomorrow and subscribe again next<br/>
April.  In Brazil I want to do things that I can not do here.<br/>
(like enjoying my family, the summer, the self-sufficient life -<br/>
eating what we grow- ..etc)  Thank you very much for letting me<br/>
share your experiences and I promisse that this year I will share<br/>
our experiences too.<br/>
<br/>
Bye!</div>

up with the email of all the groups I&#39;m subscribed to! I just go to <br/>
groups.yahoo.com and click &#39;my groups&#39; and choose which group I&#39;m <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2109260983">Noemi, <br/>
You should stay on the list and let us know how things are going in<br/>
Brazil from time to time!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m putting a package together for Aya, do you want me to hold it until<br/>
you&#39;re back in Japan?    We have some pic&#39;s of Dylan for you.   And<br/>
Tweety stuff.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s good to see you here -- I hope you can be persuaded to stay on.  <br/>
