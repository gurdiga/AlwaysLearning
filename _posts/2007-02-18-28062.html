<br/>
I just read your essay Learning To See Differently.  I have always been an unschooler in my heart and soul, but never was able to do it until now.   I have been one to always point out a full harvest moon, turn off the heeadlights and marvel at being able to drive with no headlights.  In Vermont we would see the road ensconsed in clouds, open all the windows  and drive up to see the house the same way. BUT I was the mom who pointed out the learning aspects, science facts trying to make my kids as smart as possible.  I was not the mom I am now, in stage one of deschooling, learning to let us all be who we are.  Before I was all lip service, words but no substance.  Now I am both.  What a wonderful message for my kids.<br/>
<br/>
Trying to fit in to everyone elses life was far too difficult for me and draining. I was crabby all the time.  I am so much happier this way.  I still have dreams (as I did last night) that we were meeting with my aunts and cousins (all educators) and I had to defend ourselves on the road we&#39;ve embarked on.  Then another dream where I was doing the same with my angry and sarcastic father.  Obviously I am still fighting battles where none have to exist, and that will slowly cease.  <br/>
<br/>
Your essay  hit home.  It was wonderful.  Thank You.<br/>

There&#39;s another *sandra-ism* that this little bit reminds me of: Practice<br/>
what you want to be good at.  (Is that on Peaceful Parenting??)<br/>
I count my dreams like this as practice for meeting those folks in person.<br/>
When I meet my MIL, it&#39;s not the first time I&#39;ve dealt with that sour<br/>
face... if I can call back on that practice of being self-assured and<br/>
confident in dealing with her (even if it was just in my dreams!), I really<br/>
*am* more calm and clear when it happens for real.  And they&#39;re always so<br/>
understanding in my dreams, I give them that faith when I talk in person :)<br/>
<br/>
Now say those naysayers are becoming loud and interfering with your<br/>
day-to-day peace thru unschooling, then their practice-value is gone and<br/>
they should be asked to leave your head and you should invite other,<br/>
positive voices to live in there...<br/>
I highly recommend Sandra&#39;s Peaceful Parenting<br/>
tape&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/tapes">http://sandradodd.com/tapes</a>&gt;,<br/>
as those voices are an indescribable help to me - daily!  Other voices on<br/>
other topics are available at the Live & Learn<br/>
shop&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://liveandlearnshop.com">http://liveandlearnshop.com</a>&gt;,<br/>
talks from the past few years of conferences.  (I like to have the sound of<br/>
their real voice when I&#39;m recalling the wisdom)<br/>

That&#39;s not an easy-to-guess URL, and I couldn&#39;t remember it myself,  <br/>
so I looked.  Here&#39;s the page to which Carole&#39;s referring.  Some of  <br/>
the best parts aren&#39;t by me, but I&#39;ll accept the thanks for putting  <br/>
it out there, and I&#39;m really glad it&#39;s been found and appreciated.<br/>
