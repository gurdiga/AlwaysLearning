Well we couldn&#39;t possibly wear denim jumpers, even though the thrift stores <br/>
are full of them this season.  (What is &quot;denim jumper&quot; in England?  Pinafore? <br/>
 It&#39;s not all that shaped, though--- it&#39;s not a sweater, it&#39;s a long, heavy <br/>
sleeveless dress that has to be worn over a sweater or blouse.  They are ALL, <br/>
all of them, blue.  And they are the uniform of the homeschooling mothers.  <br/>
Perhaps they come with the curriculum...)<br/>
<br/>
I would like to wear jeans and a sweatshirt, personally.  When it gets <br/>
warmer, t-shirt.  I want to be a stealth-nun.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-786395886">What the blankety darn?  Who is a makeup consultant?  I have some questions:<br/>
1.) how the sam hail do I get lipstick to stay on my lips, I bought that new<br/>
stuff that bout needs turpentine to be removed and it looked like caked on<br/>
crap.  2.)  how in the heck do I get makeup to stay on my face longer than 2<br/>
hrs, I refuse to reapply every 90 minutes - I am one of those who if it<br/>
takes longer than 15 min to do hair, makeup and get dressed it ain&#39;t worth<br/>
it.(hence the short hair, I would wear it long but I have so much hair I get<br/>
hairdo headaches when I do pull it back).<br/>
<br/>
Yes, this is an unschooling question, it involves chemistry and physics&lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Not exactly. A pinafore doesn&#39;t close in the back<br/>
(just does up at the top). Some people might use the<br/>
term &#39;apron dress&#39; though.<br/>

robes and beg at the airports. You, know, Holties? ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still fine with the robes as long as they&#39;re purple (personal <br/>
preference). But make-up?! No way. Uh uh. Not gonna happen. At least not on <br/>
my face, imperfect though it may be.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a guy here in Victoria who paints naked bodies and then photographs <br/>
them.  He paints the most amazing outfits on the model.  Even looking <br/>
closely at the photographs, you can&#39;t tell that they&#39;re naked.<br/>

Was the emphasis on &quot;my&quot; or on &quot;face&quot;?<br/>

Because I&#39;m thinking, maybe I could put some rouge on my butt, or perfume, <br/>
next to the &quot;Kiss here&quot; tattoo I&#39;ll get (IF I ever get a tattoo, which is <br/>
most likely not in this lifetime, and after I tell my mom at the age of two <br/>

<br/>
My husband&#39;s really fond of a story  about a Viking leader who was directed <br/>
to kiss the foot of some Gaulish prince or king.  <br/>
<br/>
Rollo surveyed the situation, picked the guy up by his foot, brought the foot <br/>
to his mouth with the royal guy hanging from it, kissed the foot, and put the <br/>
man back down.<br/>
