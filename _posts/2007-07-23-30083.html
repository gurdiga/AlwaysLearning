It ties in well with my lyrics game (linked from that link).<br/>
The new word&#39;s art was done in Colorado.<br/>

=====================================================<br/>
<br/>
It was fun being a baby boomer... until now. Some of the artists of the<br/>
60&#39;s are revising their hits with new lyrics to accommodate all of us  <br/>
aging<br/>
baby boomers.<br/>
<br/>
They include:<br/>
<br/>
Herman&#39;s Hermits--- Mrs.. Brown, You&#39;ve Got a Lovely Walker.<br/>
<br/>
Ringo Starr--- I Get By With a Little Help From Depends.<br/>
<br/>
The Bee Gees--- How Can You Mend a Broken Hip.<br/>
<br/>
Bobby Darin--- Splish, Splash, I Was Havin&#39; a Flash.</div>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; To commemorate her 69th birthday on October 1,<br/>
&gt; actress/vocalist, Julie Andrews made a special<br/>
&gt; appearance at Manhattan &#39;s Radio City Music Hall<br/>
&gt; for the benefit of the AARP.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One of the musical numbers she performed was &quot;My<br/>
&gt; Favorite Things&quot; from &quot;Sound Of Music&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Maalox and nose drops and needles for knitting,<br/>
&gt; Walkers and handrails and new dental fittings,<br/>
&gt; Bundles of magazines tied up in string,<br/>
&gt; These are a few of my favorite things.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Cadillacs and cataracts , and hearing aids and glasses,<br/>
&gt; Polident and Fixodent and false teeth in glasses,<br/>
&gt; Pacemakers, golf carts and porches with swings,<br/>
&gt; These are a few of my favorite things.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When the pipes leak,<br/>
&gt; When the bones creak,<br/>
&gt; When the knees go bad,<br/>
&gt; I simply remember my favorite things,<br/>
&gt; And then I don&#39;t feel so bad.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hot tea and crumpets and corn pads for bunions,<br/>
&gt; No spicy hot food or food cooked with onions,<br/>
&gt; Bathrobes and heating pads and hot meals they bring,<br/>
&gt; These are a few of my favorite things.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Back pains, confused brains, and no need for sinnin&#39;,<br/>
&gt; Thin bones and fractures and hair that is thinnin&#39;,<br/>
&gt; And we won&#39;t mention our short shrunken frames,<br/>
&gt; When we remember our favorite things.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When the joints ache,<br/>
&gt; When the hips break,<br/>
&gt; the eyes grow dim,<br/>
&gt; Then I remember the great life I&#39;ve had,<br/>
&gt; And then I don&#39;t feel so bad.<br/>
