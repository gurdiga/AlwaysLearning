<br/>
One thing I&#39;ve found is that there are often OTHER adults who are more eager <br/>
to listen to my kids when they&#39;re off and running on something that I&#39;m not <br/>
nearly as interested in as they are.... Sandra sat and watched the musical <br/>
CATS with Roxana and let her stop and start it and talk about it all <br/>
throughout when the rest of our family was really tired of it. This probably <br/>
gets easier as the kids get a little older, but you can often introduce a <br/>
topic of discussion between even a young child and another adult who will <br/>
find it interesting to get to know a young person. <br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re IN that groove I was talking about - you are the kind of person who <br/>
forges ahead and CREATES grooves for herself and then things seem easy and <br/>
fun and &quot;right.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I started doing ceramics about 6 months ago. And I&#39;m sitting here with sore <br/>
wrists and arms right now because throwing pots is HARD work. But getting it <br/>
right is just so WONDErFUL -- it feels so good and things happen so easily <br/>
and beautifully.<br/>
<br/>
Hard work - it gives a lot of satisfaction and it isn&#39;t a negative thing at <br/>
all.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe another less loaded word could be found? But - I think my mom&#39;s point <br/>
was that it WOULD seem like hard work to anybody watching us and that we <br/>
could be misleading people when we say it isn&#39;t. They sometimes seem to <br/>
expect that they can throw the curriculum out the window and then they get to <br/>
focus only on their OWN interests and let the children fend for themselves. <br/>
And certainly our detractors act like that is what they think we&#39;re doing.<br/>

Maybe another item on Sandra&#39;s list should be: Yes, follow your own<br/>
interests, as long as your children are an interest.<br/>
<br/>
Only sorta kidding, and thanks for clarifying. ;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well - THAT made me think about parents I&#39;ve known whose children are sort of <br/>
one of their projects. They DO fit their children into their schedule. But I <br/>
don&#39;t mean that in the nicest way.<br/>
<br/>
I mean people who compartmentalize their lives and &quot;the children&quot; are in one <br/>
of the compartments. I think maybe you can&#39;t really do that and unschool, <br/>
that for unschooling to &quot;work,&quot; the children have to be a total integrated <br/>
PART of the adults lives and the adults have to make the children a high <br/>
priority &quot;interest.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-718563392">My son has integrated himself into my life in the worst way.  He&#39;s <br/>
online at his friend&#39;s house and says it wouldn&#39;t really be convenient <br/>
to switch screennames (we have two accounts,and he&#39;s on my main one) <br/>
right now, so having been jones&#39;n for his list I had to come do it on <br/>
the web, which is a mystery to me and I don&#39;t like to learn, y&#39;know.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I could have said &quot;I&#39;m the mom, SCOOT,&quot; but I didn&#39;t.<br/>
I *could* go make those thinking sticks I need to make, but I have to <br/>
pick Holly and four other kids up at 3:30 and deliver them all home <br/>
from theatre class.<br/>
<br/>
So having the house all to myself, I&#39;m in here squinting around the <br/>
website when I&#39;m used to doing it by mail.  ***POOR ME***<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-For example, I tried to get &quot;Strewing their paths&quot; to match up with <br/>
my idea of learning as leading kids to a specific point. So strewing <br/>
was like dropping a trail of bread crumbs to lead an animal into a <br/>
cage.<br/>
<br/>
-=-But now I see strewing as each strewn bit creating a little path <br/>
into the world that my daughter can travel or not, explore thoroughly <br/>
or just a little. The strewing expands her world rather than leading <br/>
her any place in particular.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Joyce wrote that.  I hadn&#39;t ever thought of &quot;strewing paths&quot; as bread <br/>
crumbs leading to one place.  See how crumbly and scattered my <br/>
thoughts are?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had a vision/thought in my head since I was little.  It&#39;s about <br/>
painting a surface by just dabbing here and there randomly, for a <br/>
while, and then kinda filling in between, and then connecting dots, <br/>
and eventually having most of it covered and then just filling in the <br/>
few holes.  I&#39;ve goofed with it really, on paper, and played with it <br/>
on computers, and never put words to it or discussed it with other <br/>
people til now.  Because it seemed stupid, and inefficient, and <br/>
disorganized.  I wasn&#39;t interested in the covering of the page, but in <br/>
the process, in how &quot;wrong&quot; it was do to it wrong (or whether it was <br/>
not wrong, just different).<br/>
<br/>
So maybe that&#39;s the strewing for me.  If the paper was a black screen <br/>
and on the other side was light, and each new piece of knowledge was a <br/>
pinprick, it would be better to scatter the holes around and make <br/>
patterns that COULD be connected dot-to-dot than to just start tearing <br/>
the screen off from one corner until enough light came through that I <br/>
thought I could stop.  Or until the screen lost integrity and wasn&#39;t <br/>
there anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Depends if the goal is to get light or get patterns and have fun, I <br/>
suppose.<br/>
<br/>
If, as seems true, each person has a model of the universe inside his <br/>
head, then every single point of information, light or thought <br/>
enlarges or clarifies or better organizes that internal model.  It <br/>
doesn&#39;t help, in my mind, to think of it in so organized a fashion as <br/>
I must have the whole outline and blueprint before adding details.<br/>
<br/>
If I did model trains and was going to work on one big scenario for <br/>
the rest of my life, I wouldn&#39;t turn down the opportunity to get a <br/>
same-scale miniature truck and sheep because my tracks weren&#39;t <br/>
finished.  Every little bit helps.  And if I just FELT like making a <br/>
store with little barrels out front, so what if the train switch is <br/>
broken?  Eventually it will all come together, or it never will.  But <br/>
if I deprive myself of painting the mountainside just because it&#39;s not <br/>
the trainstation, who benefits?  <br/>
<br/>
So perhaps my kind of unschooling works because I have scattershot <br/>
thinking.  I have LOTS of dots to connect to other dots, and I have <br/>
dot-to-dot between me and kids, and between me and friends, and the <br/>
information matrix we have among us is pretty big.  If I don&#39;t know <br/>
the answer to something (and google doesn&#39;t either), I probably know <br/>
someone I can ask.<br/>
<br/>
Some principles I live by:<br/>
<br/>
I will die without knowing everything.<br/>
I will die with unfinished projects.<br/>
Organizing myself with the idea of &quot;finishing everything&quot; will cause <br/>
me to fail.<br/>
<br/>
Either I have a lot of time left, or I don&#39;t.</div>
