another homeschooler asks, I just tell them right out, &quot;we&#39;re <br/>
radical unschoolers&quot;. Very rarely do they ask (at first meeting, <br/>
lots as later) what I mean by that. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve gotten so tired of all that down here in the Bible Belt! When anyone <br/>
asks, I just tell them that my children are autodidacts and leave it it that. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes they ask what that is. Sometimes they know. Sometimes they stare <br/>
stupidly at me. Sometimes they think I must have BRILLIANT children who are <br/>
going to Harvard next fall (they&#39;re 14 and 5!).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve gotten to where I don&#39;t care AT ALL to be called a &quot;homeschooler&quot;. And <br/>
nobody knows what unschooling is (much  less, radical!)---and it&#39;s too hard <br/>
to *quickly* explain in the grocery check-out lane (even to many <br/>
homeschoolers here).<br/>
<br/>
The local homeschoolers know I&#39;m the wierd &quot;Ratmom&quot; and &quot;Doglady&quot; (great <br/>
visuals, huh?) and the RADICAL unschooler who won&#39;t discuss how to get <br/>
someone&#39;s daughter to do her math!<br/>
<br/>
My 5 year old knows to say that he&#39;s an autodidact and to tell them, &quot; It <br/>
means I teach myself.&quot; Stops &#39;em dead every time!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I just thought of a T-shirt slogan to amaze and perplex:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Autodidactism is not a crime; it&#39;s a religion.&quot;  (Praise Dodd!)<br/>
<br/>
I do call my kids &quot;autodidactyls&quot; occasionally, which sounds dinosaurian but<br/>
implies giving school the finger.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>:-) Cacie used to have this whole comedy routine she&#39;d do, with a <br/>
reporter asking the kid  questions, and one was &quot;Where do you go to<br/>
school?&quot; and the reply was &quot;Oh, I&#39;m an autodidact.&quot; Then the reporter<br/>
gets all excited about dinosaurs here in our small town, and the kid is<br/>
trying to talk him out of it, parsing the word into Latin roots, and then<br/>
the reporter notes to the audience that this is a dinosaur from Latin,<br/>
and the kid tries to explain that Latin isn&#39;t a country, but there&#39;s<br/>
Latin America, but anyway she&#39;s not a dinosaur... it went on and on and<br/>
was quite funny, if I do say so myself... she&#39;s been heavily influenced<br/>
by Monty Python, I think.<br/>
