<div id="ygrps-yiv-1881725584">In an Australian article on video games (and on Steven Johnson&#39;s <br/>
pro-video-game book which has just come out in Australia), there are three paragraphs on <br/>
Jane Healy, who spoke at the HSC conference a few years back.    That was the <br/>
same year (wasn&#39;t it?) that Dan Vilter and Kathy Ward and I did a <br/>
pro-video-gaming presentation.    The article itself is interesting (and somewhat <br/>
irritating), but I wanted to bring this passage here for examination.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Jane Healy, an educational psychologist in Colorado, is much more wary.<br/>
Healy isn&#39;t against video games but she is concerned about overuse and an<br/>
increasing reliance on computers in schools. The author of Failure to<br/>
Connect: How Computers Affect Our Children&#39;s Minds, she argues that<br/>
children have to be supervised properly both at home and at school to make<br/>
sure they are, indeed, learning and don&#39;t fall into dangerous territory.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The bottom line is parents have to be on top of this. This is not a benign<br/>
technology. You are sending your kids out into what is a potentially bad<br/>
neighbourhood when you let them use a computer, and it is up to you to make<br/>
sure they don&#39;t wander into the wrong places and do the wrong things,&quot; she<br/>
says.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;These are questions that have never before been considered by parents.<br/>
Today&#39;s parents are the pioneers. The kids are the ones that are going to<br/>
suffer the outcome. There is a cardinal rule to be developed here: it&#39;s to<br/>
be cautious - this could be dangerous stuff; it can also be useful. It is<br/>
up to you to try to draw the line.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh No! Hold on! I have to go look for my kids! Did they go into a bad<br/>
neighborhood? Oh, there they are. In my home, on the computer, chatting and<br/>
laughing together. Phew. That was a close one.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I just saw a cardinal flying outside my window! Cardinal rules are good by<br/>
me. Fly with the instinctual caution given to you. My kids have that! I do<br/>
too! Good thing, because we could fly into a bad neighborhood.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh heck, okay. I&#39;m drawing the line to stand behind to safely watch the<br/>
gamer without conking heads. I&#39;m glad she gave this advise!<br/>
<br/>
Jacki, feeling thankful that she saw the truth about video gaming before<br/>
saving her kids from the dangers of it.</div>

<br/>
Wherever and whatever she studied, she did NOT study video games.<br/>
<br/>
I met her and we corresponded a teensy bit after that conference, but I think <br/>
she&#39;s out of touch with the very IDEA of freedom and chidren all in one <br/>
thought.   She had never met any homeschoolers until the weekend she spoke at a <br/>
homeschooling conference.   Unschooled teens picked her up at the airport.   She <br/>
was very pleasantly surprised by them.   No doubt she expected a three-eyed <br/>
fish or something.   (Well, not *that* exactly, because she wouldn&#39;t get the <br/>
reference and couldn&#39;t have the vision...)<br/>

Well, many unschooled kids could discourse knowledgeably about The Simpsons for hours, but maybe Ms. Healy couldn&#39;t?<br/>
