<div id="ygrps-yiv-1967876789">HI!<br/>
<br/>
My name is Susan and we have been<br/>
homeschooling/unschooling since October 27, 1989, the<br/>
day my daughter was born, but didn&#39;t &quot;officially&quot;<br/>
begin until 1993.  We have three children, ages 12,<br/>
10, and 3.<br/>
<br/>
I first discovered John Holt through Nancy Wallace&#39;s<br/>
book _Better Than School_.  It was the first<br/>
homeschooling book I read, and I checked that book out<br/>
about 10 times the first two years, along with all of<br/>
John Holt&#39;s books, and books by Dr. Raymond and<br/>
Dorothy Moore.  Eventually I found a copy of N.W.&#39;s<br/>
book on the internet and bought it.  By then I had my<br/>
own home schooling library started.<br/>
<br/>
I still read Nancy Wallace&#39;s books every year, to keep<br/>
my resolve fresh and alive.<br/>
<br/>
Although not enitrely unschoolers in the radical<br/>
sense, we do lean very far in that direction.  The<br/>
children decide what they want to study, and we create<br/>
units of study based on that.  They help decide<br/>
activities, select the books, etc.  They don&#39;t mind<br/>
when I suggest and add other aspects to the topics<br/>
that perhaps they hadn&#39;t thought about, since they<br/>
know that &quot;Mom will always come up with fun ideas&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
In the past, we have done nature study a&#39;la Charlotte<br/>
Mason (sporadically, but heartily), as well as used<br/>
her techniques of narration and very short lessons. <br/>
We found even that to be too structured, though, and<br/>
seemed to take up our time spent on pursuing other<br/>
venues.<br/>
<br/>
As the children become older, I don&#39;t even do that so<br/>
much any more, since their interests have changed. <br/>
They still enjoy learning math-related things, and<br/>
doing the units based on their interests, and Sarah<br/>
reads a lot.  Andrew prefers playing games on the<br/>
computer and gundams and legos.<br/>
<br/>
I have had trouble finding homeschooling groups where<br/>
I actually fit in, since we are Christians who<br/>
unschool.  It seems that almost all Christians do the<br/>
school-at-home route, or classical education route.  <br/>
<br/>
Our best groups have been a local inclusive group here<br/>
in VA, although even there unschooling is very rare,<br/>
and there is a christ-centered unschoolers list on<br/>
yahoo that is nice.<br/>
<br/>
But I hope I can be a part of the list here; it would<br/>
be wonderful to be able to connect with other HSers<br/>
who actually know who John Holt is, and Nancy Wallace,<br/>
and what GWS stands for :-)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, sorry so long, most of my posts won&#39;t be this<br/>
bad!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-972993787">Hi,  I&#39;m another Susan....I&#39;m a Catholic unschooler.  So far I&#39;ve found most<br/>
of the Catholic homeschoolers around here are strict school-at-home,<br/>
classical bent.  And many seem to follow the &#39;old&#39; church teachings...as in<br/>
pre-vatican II.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve connected with them off and on.  I try to focus on the more &#39;secular&#39;<br/>
activities...&quot;field trips&quot; (cringing...it&#39;s not MY word !)  and a &quot;gym<br/>
class&quot; (again,  not my choice of wording).  These usually benefit us,<br/>
overall.  And I find if I can get past my own prejudices,  many of them are<br/>
wonderful,  caring people.  A few toss out phrases about &#39;relaxing&#39; about<br/>
academics...I wonder if they&#39;re closet unschoolers!  And many of them have<br/>
very large families by today&#39;s standards ( i.e., over 5 children)  I figure<br/>
they must have some at least relaxed standards!<br/>
<br/>
I did find a positive reference about unschooling/John Holt in a Catholic<br/>
Homeschool book called &quot;Homeward Bound&quot; (Kimberly  Hahn).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure this was way more than you wanted to know!<br/>

I just *knew* I would find someone here who knew what<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh I know exactly what you mean; I only have a few<br/>
true unschoolers as friends, most are school-at-homers<br/>
or relaxed homeschoolers like I am.  I enjoy doing the<br/>
&quot;fun&quot; activities with them, but I steer<br/>
wwwwwaaaaayyyyy clear of co-ops and formal classes.<br/>
<br/>
I started a &quot;field trips&quot; list on the VAEclectic list,<br/>
but it started getting too organized for my taste, so<br/>
we left it.  Instead of being a &quot;I&#39;m taking the kids<br/>
to the zoo, anyone want to go along?&quot; it became a<br/>
thing where people would debate about which date was<br/>
best for everyone, and started taking polls to see<br/>
where the majority wanted to go and when and how.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks again!<br/>
<br/>
