I&#39;m  thinking that Stargirl by Spinelli is also about a homeschooler. It&#39;s <br/>
been  ages since I read it though.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad you mentioned this one Tia.  We&#39;ve been meaning to buy it, having <br/>
heard it recommended by other  unschoolers.<br/>
Sierra&#39;s middle name is Star, and we&#39;ve been calling her  &quot;stargirl&quot; from the <br/>
time she was born, before we&#39;d ever heard of the  book.:)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
You&#39;ll love it, Ren. It&#39;s Cameron&#39;s favorite book, so far.<br/>

I loved it when Brenna lent it to me last year.  She just came in and <br/>
said...&quot;Stargirl&quot; is the absolute orginal unschooler and my favorite book of all <br/>
time! &quot;  She has her own copy and I know she&#39;s read it multiple times  I think <br/>
you&#39;ll enjoy it!<br/>

an encouragment or a detractor?<br/>

<br/>
Which do you want it to be? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It might just be a warning to her of some of the realities of willfully NOT <br/>
fitting in.<br/>
<br/>
I enjoyed reading Stargirl, but I didn&#39;t love it.  The character caused <br/>
embarrassment and unhappiness without regard for other people&#39;s feelings.  It&#39;s set <br/>
in Arizona, and if my experience in New Mexico and similar situations is <br/>
validly applied (it might not be, but my memories of being a teen are still <br/>
vivid), she wasn&#39;t &quot;being herself&quot; so much as she was &quot;freakin&#39;&quot; (transitively, not <br/>
&quot;freaking out&quot; but &quot;freaking the crowd&quot;--purposely being freakish).<br/>
<br/>
I saw negatives in it.  It&#39;s a joyous fantasy, in some ways, but if it were <br/>
true in all details and really happened, it&#39;s about someone who had little to <br/>
no interpersonal intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
There are no doubt a fair number of homeschoolers who are home because they <br/>
can&#39;t fathom getting along with others, but for those who are fine with <br/>
interpersonals, Stargirl might be a tad disturbing.  The overriding message is that <br/>
kids in school should loosen up, and that&#39;s fine.<br/>
<br/>
And maybe I read it too literally and I should loosen up too. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Well, I gave a copy to a 14 year old girl who I was trying to discourage from going to school.  The book shows that being different from others in school can provoke unpleasant behavior.<br/>

I felt the characters were caricatures.  The homeschooled girl &quot;unsocialized&quot; to the point of being anti-social and the school kids &quot;socialized&quot; to the point of being clones of one another.  The story is a good starting point for discussions on what it means to fit in.<br/>

I think she&#39;d she it for you what it is: Real. This fun, funky girl  tries to <br/>
fit in to make her boyfriend happy. They both realize that&#39;s NOT Who  She Is.<br/>
 <br/>
Great book!<br/>
