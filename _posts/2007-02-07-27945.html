<div id="ygrps-yiv-1877978807">This is a response to Sandra&#39;s post, but I believe it benefits the entire <br/>
group and is not intended to be a side conversation leaving the rest of you <br/>
out of the loop. It is similar to having a public conversation at a round <br/>
table discussion. All can benefit from it.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for those who have responded to me personally regarding this.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why would you imply that I was in defense of a family where cynicism and <br/>
unhappiness are common?<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t you want a family that unschools to offer food, shelter, and love? <br/>
Love encompasses doing your best and unconditional acceptance. And is it <br/>
possible for you to see this as a simple statement, not all encompassing of <br/>
mine or anyone else&#39;s view of unschooling.<br/>

&gt;she can improve her own life and those of her children and<br/>
&gt;grandchildren by taking steps rto perk up and be better.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I NEVER said someone should settle for a half-assed job. And to tell someone <br/>
to &quot;perk up&quot;  and &quot;be better&quot;? Are we naive people who don&#39;t understand that <br/>
life is not perky and better all the time? Or to tell someone that might <br/>
actually make it happen? And to imply that doing these things make you a <br/>
more adequate unschooler is naive as best. Perking up and being better is <br/>
unrealistic sometimes. Struggle and conflict shape us and teach us to <br/>
appreciate the good times.  Although we can all agree that not sweating the <br/>
small stuff is sound advice.<br/>
<br/>
You come across as a person of principal, I assume from what I&#39;ve read that <br/>
you are. As well as a person with good advice and discussion in regards to <br/>
unschooling. Your insistence on twisting this issue into more than it was <br/>
ever intended comes across as a superiority complex and in poor taste.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ackowledging that unschooling can happen in even less than ideal <br/>
circumstances isnt necessarily defending those circumstances. I&#39;ve <br/>
seen parents told to &quot;just put your kid in school&quot; if they arent <br/>
able or willing to unschooling in an ideal way, or arent able to be <br/>
the &quot;best&quot; unschooling parent (because they are working fulltime, or <br/>
going through a divorce,or fighting with a spouse or whatever.) <br/>
<br/>
My niece has a verbally abusive, emotionally absent alcoholic father <br/>
and a non-medicated/nondiagnosed bipolar mother off work on physical <br/>
disability. She (niece) usually stays in her room and reads. Would i <br/>
ever encourage her mother to homeschool? No, i think school is <br/>
probably an escape for my niece. But if her mother was willing to <br/>
put forth even a *minimal* amount of effort towards spending quality <br/>
time with her daughter, or occasionally getting out to do <br/>
fun/interesting things, then i would say homeschooling *would* be <br/>
better. She has those less-than-ideal parents whether or not she <br/>
goes to school, school just adds a whole other layer of stress to <br/>
her life. She sees our life, and knows it could be different for <br/>
her, but it won&#39;t be--not at home, not at school, and thats sad. <br/>
<br/>
Obviously, this list isnt a place where we&#39;d want to encourage &quot;good <br/>
enough&quot; unschooling, or minimal effort. But in a broader discussion <br/>
of when does school become a better option than <br/>
homeschooling/unschooling, i would say as long as the child and <br/>
parent both desire to unschool, and the environment isnt one that a <br/>
child would want an 8 hour daily escape from, then unschooling is <br/>
almost always better. &quot;Cynicism and unhappiness&quot; occur quite <br/>
frequently in the school setting, so i don&#39;t neccarily see it as a <br/>
salve to those particular problems. <br/>
<br/>
Better that the parents continue to unschool, and work on the <br/>
behavior than decide &quot;well i&#39;m not cut out for unschooling&quot; and put <br/>
the kids back in school. I would hope that a mother coming to this <br/>
list for help would not want to settle for an unhappy life, after <br/>
reading about all the joy and happiness that unschooling well brings <br/>
to the lives of those who are living it.<br/>

unschooled&quot; as being a bit dismissive of the work that is talked about<br/>
above...the work that the parent could do to be more joyful and have a more<br/>
joyful home. Maybe the op didn&#39;t mean it that way, and maybe just a few of<br/>
us took it that way, but I was glad that the idea was expanded upon,<br/>
particularly because I believe the op was a person new to unschooling<br/>
(though my memory could be wrong this way) and it presented the idea to a<br/>
list that has many new unschoolers on it. The idea itself sitting out there<br/>
alone definitely felt unfinished to me.<br/>

positive family - heck, my family had a fire in our house and we  <br/>
haven&#39;t been able to live in our own house for a year (not  <br/>
complaining, we&#39;re living in a really nice apartment in a really nice  <br/>
place and we&#39;re going to have a much nicer house when we move home,  <br/>
just saying, yeah, for sure I know that difficulties happen and  <br/>
living ).<br/>
<br/>
The statement made was an absolute - that kids ARE better off  <br/>
unschooling as long as basic needs are met. Lots of parents love  <br/>
their kids and meet their basic needs, but still the kids might be  <br/>
better off in school if the parents are negative and cynical and  <br/>
creating a lot of unhappiness in the home. Don&#39;t you think it would  <br/>
be better for kids to spend time away from that? Unschooling isn&#39;t  <br/>
for everyone - and commonly cynical and unhappy is not conducive to  <br/>
an encouraging, supportive, and positive household. Unschooling does  <br/>
really need more than just loving our kids and meeting their basic  <br/>
needs.<br/>

When i reread the thread, i felt like Wildflower was responding to <br/>
this by the original poster:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I took out the &quot;unwilling to change&quot; because I feel I have now <br/>
become aware That I do project these traits and am wanting to change <br/>
and am actively trying to find ways to do this. However, it seems <br/>
like a very long process. My ds has just turned 12, does he have <br/>
time as for me to go through this process? I see the same type of <br/>
reactions in him. His biological father was a angry, critical person <br/>
too. Am I doing more damage than good trying to unschool him while I <br/>
work on these issues I have?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She seems to be wondering if it would be better to unschool while <br/>
working on her issues, even if it isnt the &quot;perfect&quot; (for lack of a <br/>
better word)unschooling that many of us describe, or because this <br/>
might take her awhile would her son be better off in school. I guess <br/>
its a reasonable thing for a scared/unsure newbie mom of a 12 yr old <br/>
to wonder.<br/>
<br/>
Wildflower responded &quot;But I think that as long as children are <br/>
having basic needs met, food, shelter, and love, they are better off <br/>
being unschooled.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If a person feels that the mountain is so high they can&#39;t possibly <br/>
get to the top &quot;in time&quot;, should they not bother to climb at all? I <br/>
would say, climb as quickly as you can, one boot in front of the <br/>
other, and don&#39;t worry about the top right now, just take it one <br/>
step at a time and try your best to climb as much as you can <br/>
*today*, if it seems that overwhelming to you. <br/>
<br/>
I guess since my son had such a traumatizing experience in school <br/>
(that he still sometimes talks about over three years later), it <br/>
would take ALOT of unhappiness in our home for me to think school <br/>
was a better option. I wouldnt recommend someone do a half-assed job <br/>
of unschooling, or live in an unhappy, negative home. But yeah, i <br/>
think even a home that consists of the kind of &quot;benign neglect&quot; that <br/>
some parents try to pass off as unschooling is almost always <br/>
preferable to most school experiences. It can be so much better than <br/>
that though, and i would encourage any parent not to settle for less.<br/>

You can think that, but I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll find any state laws or  <br/>

acting on that belief would endanger all the unschoolers everywhere.<br/>

It HAS to be better than benign neglect, or it&#39;s nothing but benign  <br/>

   <br/>
  ******<br/>
  I&#39;m so glad to see this come up now.  Just yesterday I was on the phone with my sister.  I asked how the home/unschooling is going and how her son is enjoying high school.  After years of being a huge proponent of public schooling and NEED for education, my sister pulled her kids out of school after moving to Memphis, TN in Feb 05.  Her son was 12 (almost 13 then) and her daughter 6.  She went into it relaxed, thinking she&#39;d put together her own curriculum. <br/>
   <br/>
  Gradually, she drifted into unschooling something that looked like it wanted to be unschooling.  Not really unschooling, tho I shared with her lots of links, info, answers to questions, etc.  Her dh is really not on board, thinks they&#39;re doing their daughter a disservice.  My first thought was that it&#39;s always better to get the kids home.  I&#39;m having to reconsider this thought.  <br/>
   <br/>
  This past spring my nephew visited for a few weeks.  He had already decided then that he&#39;d be returning to school in the fall -- this past August.  In talking with him about this -- my sister had asked me to &#39;talk him into staying home&#39; -- I learned why he wanted to return to school.  They don&#39;t go anywhere -- my sister has health issues, they have only car, she can&#39;t find any nearby groups/activities, etc.  I&#39;ve found local uschoolers for her. Gary and I&#39;ve gone most of the last year sharing one car, for a variety of reasons.  I have days when I don&#39;t feel well.  And yet, I find ways to get out with my kids -- I&#39;m sure she could, too, but she doesn&#39;t!  Her kids end up without social outlets; she doesn&#39;t manage to find a way to show her dh that the kids are learning.  In short, she&#39;s not succeeding at homeschooling.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Then yesterday, while talking about how my nephew is doing in school, she said something and I realized she just totally does not get unschooling or natural learning.  I had invited her to the last two conferences (she could have stayed with me and saved hotel money this past year) but she didn&#39;t make either one.  She has family and friends in Dallas and could easily hit the RE conference, but hasn&#39;t.  I&#39;m beginning to worry that she is doing her kids a disservice, by simply not doing anything consistently enough. I know her well enough to guess that she&#39;s simply overwhelmed and doesn&#39;t feel she has the resources to do any more than she&#39;s doing.  Maybe that&#39;s true -- I just don&#39;t know anymore.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I just don&#39;t see her overcoming the obstacles to true unschooling in her house -- or even some kind of relaxed, eclectic homeschooling.  I&#39;m sad to hear her daughter now talking about returning to school -- and my sister telling her that before she can go back, they need to &#39;make progress&#39; or she&#39;ll never pass the test for grade placement.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I guess what bothers me most is that it&#39;s not that unschooling failed them, but that my sister failed to really get/live/share unschooling in a way that helped her children.  I&#39;m beginning to think, given my sister&#39;s underlying traditional mindset, that her kids really are better off in school. <br/>

Thank you for this discussion. I think it is true that school may cause more<br/>
stress-for the whole family. I think that cynicism could be an outward<br/>
expression of frustrated emotional giftedness that needs nurturing. That<br/>
probably won&#39;t happen in a school. In this case, school would probably cause<br/>
more stress.<br/>

Yesterday I was agitated and angsty for a large part of the  <br/>
afternoon.  I wasn&#39;t happy.  I was stressed.  But I admitted it to  <br/>
Keith and the kids and I made an effort to get out of it.  With  <br/>
practice and desire, people can learn to induce better moods.  Really.<br/>
<br/>
So here&#39;s what I had written and saved, whenever back on the list.  I  <br/>

life is not perky and better all the time?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Please don&#39;t use &quot;we&quot; to generalize your statements to the group.<br/>
<br/>
Life is not perky all the time.  I can be better every second,  <br/>
though, or worse.  People make choices.<br/>
<br/>
You chose to call me naive, and worse.  That didn&#39;t help anyone  <br/>
understand unschooling better.  It didn&#39;t make you look compassionate  <br/>
or thoughtful.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Or to tell someone that might<br/>
actually make it happen? -=-<br/>
<br/>
Are you saying that encouraging people to be happier will have no  <br/>
effect?<br/>
Are you saying that recommending the simple tools of determining how  <br/>
one wants to be (defining principles and knowing how something might  <br/>
be better) and then making choices in that direction is naive and in  <br/>
poor taste?<br/>
<br/>
-=-And to imply that doing these things make you a<br/>
more adequate unschooler is naive as best.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Being happy makes one a happier unschooler.<br/>
Being more positive positively makes one a better unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
There is no such thing as &quot;more adequate.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Adequate&quot; is half-assed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you would like to begin a list for the discussion of the bare  <br/>
minimum you consider to be acceptable unschooling, go and do it.  Go  <br/>
here:   <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/start">http://groups.yahoo.com/start</a><br/>
Yahoogroups will walk you through forming the group.  You can  <br/>
advertise it here, once, and then you can go and do whatever it is  <br/>
you want to do, which you think is greatly superior to this list&#39;s  <br/>
seven year history of encouraging people to do incrementally better  <br/>
until their lives are happy, sparkly, and fun.    It can be done.   <br/>
It&#39;s done all the time.<br/>
<br/>
If you can&#39;t do it, don&#39;t say &quot;we.&quot;<br/>
My family has been doing it for  years and has done it today.  We  <br/>
know the direction away from where we want to be, and we know the  <br/>
direction toward.  When most decisions move toward our ideal, the day  <br/>
is better, unschooling is better, our lives are better.  Better isn&#39;t  <br/>
&quot;adequate.&quot;  It&#39;s better. And it can continue to get better.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-506906606">I tend to read from this group on a minimal basis, but when I read <br/>
this I associated with it right away. I have been unschooling my two <br/>
boys (8yo, 4yo) for almost four years now and I have never felt so <br/>
much joy! We have our bad days, sure, but after we leap over our <br/>
hurdles we are stronger and have learned so much about each other <br/>
and our limits. I have found that learning is constant. We know each <br/>
other so well that we just fit like a puzzle and are happy about 99% <br/>
of the time.<br/>
Now when I spend time with other families that aren&#39;t in the same <br/>
place we are I get some side effects of jealousy and almost anger <br/>
from them. Instead of sharing our experiences and learning from one <br/>
another there is competition and denial of their negative attitudes. <br/>
It is the most upsetting thing in my life. The hostility will linger <br/>
with me for days... why did they do that? why can&#39;t we just learn <br/>
from one another? why did they want to compete with me (us)? why <br/>
does it have to be this way? can&#39;t they see my amazing children for <br/>
the beautiful people that they are, not where they are failing?<br/>
I know that I need to learn to just ignore them. Find my oily back <br/>
so to say. But it is hard for me and something that I try very hard <br/>
each day to let go of. Why do I need to know why? :)<br/>
My children, husband and I love unschooling! It fits our <br/>
personalities and our lives. I wish that others could see the beauty <br/>
of a happy family and share in our joy more often than they do.<br/>
Does anyone else experience this? Or do I just hang around the <br/>
worong people:) ?<br/>
Thanks for listening.<br/>

Your story reminds me of a time when I was in the store with my older two<br/>
kids before the third was born.  The oldest was about 3+ and the younger<br/>
was about 5 months and slung on my back.  We were standing in the check out<br/>
line and there was a very frazzled looking woman in front of us with a<br/>
crying baby in a bucket perched on the cart.  My daughter looks up at me and<br/>
says, &quot;why doesn&#39;t that woman just nurse her baby?  That&#39;s what he<br/>
*needs*!&quot;  I just shrugged and said, &quot;I don&#39;t know, honey.  Is that what<br/>
you&#39;d do?&quot;  She says, &quot;well, it couldn&#39;t be worse than this...&quot;  =)<br/>

 <br/>
My 11yo daughter&#39;s friend&#39;s mom is *very* punitive and I just heard from my <br/>
daughter who heard from the friend that this mom took away her cherished <br/>
stuffed bunny (which was a gift from *my* daughter) because she left it on the <br/>
couch!  (I know, what kind of rule is that, anyway??)<br/>
 <br/>
So now my daughter is totally upset, what&#39;s going to happen to the bunny? <br/>
(because in her world, stuffed animals are very real.)  So we&#39;ve had discussions <br/>
about how cruel it is to treat your kids that way, expecting them to follow <br/>
every rule and never make mistakes. <br/>
 <br/>
I know I won&#39;t get anywhere with criticizing the mom, but I did send her an <br/>
email asking her a favor, avoiding making any judgment of her parenting.  Since <br/>
my daughter is so upset, if what we&#39;ve heard is true and she is planning to <br/>
get rid of the bunny, would she be willing to give it back to my daughter?  I <br/>
even offered to pay postage since she lives out of state.  We&#39;ll see what she <br/>
says.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s so annoying to me when other people&#39;s lame parenting hurts other <br/>
people&#39;s kids!<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m not sure how this ties in with helping the original poster.  Maybe <br/>
something along the lines of finding &quot;the serenity to accept the things you can&#39;t <br/>
change, courage to change the things you can, and the wisdom to know the <br/>
difference.&quot;  <br/>

<br/>
Yes.<br/>
And it hurts their children&#39;s friendships sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of Holly&#39;s local female friends, one lately and one years  <br/>
ago, used the &quot;privilege&quot; of hanging out with Holly to control them  <br/>
about things like cleaning toilets and guessing how the parents  <br/>
wanted them to respond to questions, basically.  They could get in  <br/>
trouble for attitude.<br/>
<br/>
So in the case of each family, more than once Holly got a  <br/>
cancellation very late, like the day before or the same day, that  <br/>
something she had looked forward to wasn&#39;t going to happen.<br/>
<br/>
All it seemed like was a punishment for liking someone whose parents  <br/>
were more interested in punishment than compassion and joy.  And the  <br/>
parents clearly cared *nothing* about Holly and her feelings.<br/>

Chamille is in a constant state of hurt over it.  It&#39;s really unfair, <br/>
but there is little we can do about it, except to try and find more <br/>
friends.  Chamille not only hurts for herself, but being the very <br/>
empathic person she is, she hurts for her friend as well.<br/>

Our recent attempt at contact is written about here:<br/>

<br/>
As far as public encounters with mean parents, it just screams out <br/>
loudly in our peaceful life of being nice to kids.  It&#39;s like getting <br/>
stung by a bee when you are innocently smelling those pretty flowers.  <br/>
Chamille has less tolerance than I do in regards to mean parents in <br/>
public places.  She just wants to leave and now, while I try to impress <br/>
happiness on the situation hoping for a positive change in the moment.</div>

My kids have a friend and if he is in trouble his parents will call and ask if my kids can come stay the night to help him behave.  They also use my kids as babysitters so they don&#39;t have to entertain their child.  He is 8 and my kids are 8 and 10.  The mom would rather have my kids at her house to play with her kid so he will &quot;stay out of her hair&quot;<br/>

 <br/>
Replying to my own post...<br/>
 <br/>
Good news (sort of)...the mom&#39;s planning to try to persuade the stepdad, who <br/>
was actually the one who took it, to give back the bunny when the girl does <br/>
something &quot;cool, responsible or mature.&quot;  I&#39;m not supposed to tell my daughter.  <br/>
So of course, what do I do, I tell my daughter.  <br/>
 <br/>
So there&#39;s another thing.  It&#39;s so annoying when other parents expect my <br/>
loyalty to be to *them* instead of to my own kid!<br/>
 <br/>
Abby (my daughter, who now says she&#39;s okay with me using her name) says she <br/>
thinks it&#39;d be best not to tell the friend so she doesn&#39;t get her hopes up.  <br/>
But she *might* advise her, as a friend, of course, that maybe the parents might <br/>
give her back the bunny if she does something cool, responsible or mature.  <br/>
LOL!  <br/>
 <br/>
Argh, what a mess, watch this come back and bite me in the butt.  I&#39;m the one <br/>
who ends up feeling like the naughty kid!<br/>
 <br/>
My son (12) has a friend who&#39;s being punished right now too.  He&#39;s not <br/>
allowed to play Maplestory online until November, or talk on the phone with my son <br/>
while he plays it, so he sneaks in these three-minute calls and then hangs up <br/>
the phone when he hears his mom coming.  I asked my son what the friend did <br/>
that was so terrible.  The friend says he doesn&#39;t remember.<br/>
