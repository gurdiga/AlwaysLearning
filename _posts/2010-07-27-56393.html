<div id="ygrps-yiv-83018073">I am trying to figure out the reasons behind something my daughter is doing and I&#39;m hoping someone will have some insight.  <br/>
<br/>
She is 4.5 and we go through the following scenario multiple times a day:  <br/>
<br/>
I suggest something like if she would like to go outside (it could be ANY suggestion) and she will loudly proclaim NO! and fold her arms and stick her nose up in the air and turn around.  <br/>
<br/>
Or I will offer her something like a glass of water and she will give me the same response.<br/>
<br/>
I am left completely puzzled and tell her &quot;No thank you works just fine.&quot;  It&#39;s really dramatic, as if I am *telling* her to do something just awful instead of making a nice suggestion that she is completely free to turn down or giving her something she is completely free not to take.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Another related thing she is doing is dramatically getting quite upset over things that really only require a simple request to get fixed.  Like this evening she asked me to pour her some rice milk.  When I handed her the cup she threw herself on the floor and yelled &quot;That&#39;s not enough!&quot;  Um, ok....... how about mom can you please pour me some more? And I&#39;m more than happy to do that!<br/>

It&#39;s hard to see something from someone else&#39;s perspective if you have a negative slant to how you&#39;re viewing their actions and reactions. <br/>

===I suggest something like if she would like to go outside (it could be ANY suggestion) and she will loudly proclaim NO! and fold her arms and stick her nose up in the air and turn around.===<br/>
<br/>
When you make those type of suggestions, is she already doing something or are you making suggestions in response to her telling you she&#39;s bored or asking if you&#39;ll play with her?<br/>
<br/>
What I used to do with my son (sometimes still do) was to say, &quot;I&#39;m going out back to swing. When you get done with what you&#39;re doing or if you want to take a break, you&#39;re welcome to join me.&quot; Sometimes he just wasn&#39;t in a place where he could, or wanted to, give me a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; answer at that moment -- me going ahead and making the choice and then inviting him to join in if he wanted to gave him the chance to get there on his own terms.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
===Or I will offer her something like a glass of water and she will give me the same response.===<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t handle it as an offer, just do it for her. Every morning after my son wakes up, I take a glass of water to his room. When I take him food to eat throughout the day, if his glass is empty or nearly empty, I&#39;ll take it and fill it up for him. <br/>
<br/>
If you do the same thing for your daughter and she gets mad at you for it, you could set the glass out of her way but somewhere where it&#39;ll be easy to point it out to her when she tells you she&#39;s thirsty.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
===I am left completely puzzled and tell her &quot;No thank you works just fine.===<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;m feeling unhappy or irritable, the last thing I want is someone telling me to not be cranky or rude!<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re puzzled by her reaction, maybe it would help to simply reply &quot;okay&quot; and, depending on her personality, let her have some time alone or ask if she&#39;d like to snuggle up with you to watch tv or read. She&#39;ll be more inclined to open up to you if your words and body language express compassion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
===When I handed her the cup she threw herself on the floor and yelled &quot;That&#39;s not enough!&quot;  Um, ok....... how about mom can you please pour me some more?===<br/>
<br/>
Is that how you responded to her, &quot;how about, mom can you please pour me some more?&quot;??? That response is about what *you&#39;re* feeling, not about what *she&#39;s* feeling.<br/>
<br/>
You could have poured her a HUGE glass of milk. You could have poured her two glasses of milk. You could have asked her if she would like to help you pour the milk so she could show you the amount she&#39;d like. All of those things could have been done nicely and cheerfully.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Take the focus off how she &quot;should&quot; act, so that it&#39;ll be easier to focus on if there&#39;s something else going on. If it&#39;s something more than being tired or hungry (easily fixed!), you&#39;ll have a better chance of figuring out what it is if you&#39;re not thinking in terms of &quot;dramatic&quot; or &quot;not polite&quot;.<br/>

There is a simple time-honored solution.   &quot;Say when.&quot;<br/>
Or &quot;How much?&quot; in advance.  Let her point to the place on the cup  <br/>
where she wants the milk.  Maybe she wants a bigger cup, and can say  <br/>
so in advance of any pouring.<br/>

You&#39;re right, they do sound negative.  Usually I think her dramatics are awesome and see her personality in a very positive light.  Until she&#39;s being rude to me.  And that&#39;s probably assigning negative intent too.  I know she&#39;s not *trying* to be rude, but that is the way it comes across.  <br/>

It really seems like it can be ANY suggestion about anything.  Not that she does it EVERY time, but when she does it seems really random.  I will pay more attention though and see if I spot a pattern.<br/>

I do this and she still has the same reaction sometimes.  <br/>

<br/>
Yah, I get that.  I feel the same way.  I want to give her words to say that are more appropriate (not make her say them, but just make her aware of them) and I don&#39;t really know how to do that in a kind, helpful way.<br/>

=======================<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, that is how I responded.  She got up and repeated it after me and I did cheerfully continue to pour until she said stop.  I will be honest and say that the times that she continues to act like that after I have suggested more appropriate wording, I don&#39;t act cheerful back.  I get irritated.  On one hand, I understand how it might be helpful to continue to do things cheerfully and kindly no matter how she is acting.  I realize that I shouldn&#39;t let her mood dictate my response.  On the other hand, no one else in the world is probably going to do that for her.  How do I let her know that when she is rude when someone is helping her, people are going to be far less inclined to continue to help her, without being rude and mean myself?  <br/>
<br/>

&gt; Take the focus off how she &quot;should&quot; act, so that it&#39;ll be easier to focus on if there&#39;s something else going on.

<br/>
Thank you, that&#39;s just the reminder I needed!  When she does things like that, it just triggers this instant reaction in me and at that moment I&#39;m not thinking one bit about *why* she is acting that way.  I will try to keep that in mind today and see how things go!<br/>

<br/>
I wanted to add, though, that we can often need reminding that a child&#39;s <br/>
brain is growing and developing and changing and that different parts of <br/>
the brain develop at different times. There are periods of awkwardness <br/>
in brain development just like there are in the rest of the body, and <br/>
disequilibrium in brain development can lead to some behaviors that do <br/>
seem to be &quot;out of nowhere.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So - consider and try all the great advice you&#39;ll get here, but also be <br/>
very sweet and understanding to your daughter because it may be the <br/>
brain is going through a bit of a painful growth spurt - maybe in the <br/>
part of the brain that likes to be in control of things.<br/>

<br/>
Point missed.<br/>
YOU called it &quot;dramatic,&quot; and dramatic puts a negative judgment on  <br/>
it.  Rather than defending the word, people are suggesting that you  <br/>
rephrase entirely so that you&#39;re looking at her without drama-colored  <br/>

<br/>
Not &quot;probably.&quot;  And if she&#39;s consciously trying to communicate  <br/>
frustration, it might be because she&#39;s feeling frustrated.  So look  <br/>
back a few steps at why she&#39;s frustrated, not at the way she&#39;s acting  <br/>
after you&#39;ve disregarded her needs.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Then stop making suggestions.  Find a different way to communicate.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Not that she does it EVERY time, but when she does it seems really  <br/>

<br/>
If it&#39;s random, we can&#39;t possibly help you.<br/>
Try to spot patterns first and then ask for assistance!   We can&#39;t  <br/>
help you if all you tell us is &quot;something&#39;s happening.&quot;  But I&#39;m  <br/>
thinking now that she has a mom who wasn&#39;t paying attention before,  <br/>
nor looking for patterns.   (Not really trying to pick on you, just  <br/>
putting the spotlight on what you just wrote and sent to the list.)<br/>
<br/>
-= I want to give her words to say that are more appropriate -=-<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t do it while she&#39;s in the frustrated moment.  Maybe talk about it  <br/>
later.  Maybe a week later.  Maybe do more modelling of the way you  <br/>
want her to be, and accept that it can take years for kids to pick up  <br/>
on modelling.  (Not so many years if it&#39;s been since birth; more time  <br/>
if the mom changes to a different way of speaking and acting.)<br/>

<br/>
Keep it mind not just today, but for the rest of your life.<br/>
Try these ideas for many days, different ways, rather than reporting  <br/>
back after one day.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Could it be that she&#39;d rather do things for herself? My dd used to do something similar, around the same age, if I&#39;d do something for her or even offer to do something for her that she wanted to be the one to do. She wanted a lot of independence and there I was, getting in her way by being helpful. How rude of me! <br/>
<br/>
If was more helpful of me to offer her opportunities to do things and make the things she liked to do easier - like keep smaller pitchers of milk and juice for her to pour, make sure there were convenient step-stools, that sort of thing. <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>**************<br/>
<br/>
Use lots of kind, helpful words yourself. If you&#39;re responding to her outbursts by being cross or snippy, that doesn&#39;t help her know what &quot;grace under pressure&quot; looks like. Something is stressing her a bit, and that&#39;s going to get in the way of being cool and calm in the moment. <br/>
<br/>
You can try talking to her about how to ask politely outside of times when she&#39;s upset, look for stories or shows or movies where people are being polite to one another, but in the moment, its not helpful. In a way, its *you* making a mountain out of a molehill - she&#39;s acting like a young child and you&#39;re getting upset about it. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We are talking about a 4.5 year old little girl right? I am pointing this out because I have 4 girls ranging in age from 18 months to 9 years. They have all had periods where that have had really big emotional responses. It is perfectly normal for little kids to have big responses to things that adults perceive as something small. Have you ever had a day where something little irritates you and you react rudely? As an adult, I can usually , but not always, stuff those feelings down. I don&#39;t think it is realistic for a 4.5 year old to be able to suppress her frustrations and reword things in the moment. If you continue to model &quot;niceness&quot; and consideration, kids will pick up on it. It may not happen tomorrow but it will eventually catch on. <br/>
<br/>
Nobody else in the world does for my children what I do. As the mom, I want my children to feel safe expressing all of their emotions whether it is rude or not. My kids have picked up on being nice versus being rude from seeing how I interact with their dad. They see it when we go to the grocery store and talk to the check out person. They see it in all of our interactions with the rest of the world. I don&#39;t feel the need to let them know when they are in the middle of a moment of frustration. We usually talk about it after we have been out and have had an encounter with somebody that was really nice or was really rude. <br/>
<br/>
To you or me, not having the right amount of liquid in a cup may not seem like a big deal. To a little kid that doesn&#39;t have a lot of experience with the world, it can be a huge deal. Not only does she have to rely on you to get her a drink but she has to rely on you to get her the right amount. Then, if you get her the wrong amount and she speaks up, you get mad and tell her what to say and how to act. To you, it may seem like an occasional suggestion. To her, it may feel like you are nitpicking everything she says and does. There is a possibility that she feels like your constant suggestions are nitpicking. She may have picked up on the habit of nitpicking from you so her &quot;random drama&quot; could be her mirroring your behavior. I am not trying to pick on you. I am just trying to offer other possibilities. Whenever I find myself noticing something about my girls&#39; behavior, the first thing I do is check my own because I have a tendency to make small changes in my behavior or attitude and don&#39;t realize it until I see my girls mirroring it back to me. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>If a person knows in advance that someone is always kind in the face<br/>
of negativity, then that person --who may or may not continue to be<br/>
rude--- can relax more.<br/>
<br/>
I think there&#39;s a difference between politeness and kindness.<br/>
<br/>
Politeness isn&#39;t actually the same thing as kindness. Some polite<br/>
people can be cruel with it (or even rude with it) and that could in<br/>
some cases be considered a fine art. It&#39;s also a fine art to be rude<br/>
yet kind with it. I just met a 70-something gal who is very<br/>
rough-mannered and says things like &quot;shut-up&quot; but the twist is she<br/>
isn&#39;t actually expecting anybody to shut up and is in fact encouraging<br/>
people to come out of their shells to join her in hilarity. She&#39;s<br/>
incredibly sweetheartedly humorous as she invites people to join in<br/>
and, as Glenda suggested about inviting her child to come swing if he<br/>
wants to (but with a very different tone and feel), the water is fine.<br/>
:)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also possible to be polite AND kind but it might not even be a<br/>
good idea to be that way all the time, no matter what.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that&#39;s true about drama is that there&#39;s lots of power in it,<br/>
and people are drawn to that. Most of it hasn&#39;t got much to do with<br/>
kindness or peace, but there is that too as a possibility. A<br/>
super-powerful combo. I&#39;ve seen it but haven&#39;t figured out how to pull<br/>
it off.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s what your daughter is interested in. Or there might be<br/>
something else going on. I think your idea of watching the patterns to<br/>
see if/when rudeness occurs or gets more intense (or whatever else you<br/>
find to look for in patterns) could be very helpful to know.<br/>

&gt;&gt; What I used to do with my son (sometimes still do) was to say, &quot;I&#39;m going out back to swing. When you get done with what you&#39;re doing or if you want to take a break, you&#39;re welcome to join me.&quot; Sometimes he just wasn&#39;t in a place where he could, or wanted to, give me a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; answer at that moment -- me going ahead and making the choice and then inviting him to join in if he wanted to gave him the chance to get there on his own terms.<br/>
&gt; =============<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I do this and she still has the same reaction sometimes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ==============<br/>
&gt;&gt; Don&#39;t handle it as an offer, just do it for her. Every morning after my son wakes up, I take a glass of water to his room. When I take him food to eat throughout the day, if his glass is empty or nearly empty, I&#39;ll take it and fill it up for him.<br/>
&gt; =================<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yes, this is what I meant when I said offer.  I physically have it in my hands and am giving it to her.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; =============<br/>
&gt;&gt; ===I am left completely puzzled and tell her &quot;No thank you works just fine.===<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; When I&#39;m feeling unhappy or irritable, the last thing I want is someone telling me to not be cranky or rude!<br/>
&gt; ===================<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yah, I get that.  I feel the same way.  I want to give her words to say that are more appropriate (not make her say them, but just make her aware of them) and I don&#39;t really know how to do that in a kind, helpful way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; =====================<br/>
&gt;&gt; ===When I handed her the cup she threw herself on the floor and yelled &quot;That&#39;s not enough!&quot;  Um, ok....... how about mom can you please pour me some more?===<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Is that how you responded to her, &quot;how about, mom can you please pour me some more?&quot;??? That response is about what *you&#39;re* feeling, not about what *she&#39;s* feeling.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; You could have poured her a HUGE glass of milk. You could have poured her two glasses of milk. You could have asked her if she would like to help you pour the milk so she could show you the amount she&#39;d like. All of those things could have been done nicely and cheerfully.<br/>
&gt; =======================<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yes, that is how I responded.  She got up and repeated it after me and I did cheerfully continue to pour until she said stop.  I will be honest and say that the times that she continues to act like that after I have suggested more appropriate wording, I don&#39;t act cheerful back.  I get irritated.  On one hand, I understand how it might be helpful to continue to do things cheerfully and kindly no matter how she is acting.  I realize that I shouldn&#39;t let her mood dictate my response.  On the other hand, no one else in the world is probably going to do that for her.  How do I let her know that when she is rude when someone is helping her, people are going to be far less inclined to continue to help her, without being rude and mean myself?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ==================<br/>
&gt;&gt; Take the focus off how she &quot;should&quot; act, so that it&#39;ll be easier to focus on if there&#39;s something else going on. If it&#39;s something more than being tired or hungry (easily fixed!), you&#39;ll have a better chance of figuring out what it is if you&#39;re not thinking in terms of &quot;dramatic&quot; or &quot;not polite&quot;.<br/>
&gt; ==================<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thank you, that&#39;s just the reminder I needed!  When she does things like that, it just triggers this instant reaction in me and at that moment I&#39;m not thinking one bit about *why* she is acting that way.  I will try to keep that in mind today and see how things go!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think being rude and mean to a 4.5 year old helps her trust  <br/>
you to help her when *she&#39;s* being rude (or cranky or frustrated). And  <br/>
why would you want to be rude and mean to her? The only thing she  <br/>
might learn is her mom can&#39;t be any more mature than she is.<br/>
<br/>
I know I have had the same kind reaction myself (and sometimes still  <br/>
do, but I can stop myself now). For me, it was how I was treated when  <br/>
I was little and all riled up. It was *not* okay to be rude or angry  <br/>
in my house.  So, the indignation my parents showed can automatically  <br/>
come out of me. I&#39;ve had to be really conscious of that tendency.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing: some people help others when their help isn&#39;t wanted or  <br/>
asked for. Consequently, they&#39;re offended if their help isn&#39;t welcome,  <br/>
especially if the annoyed person is a kid. But kids, like adults,  <br/>
don&#39;t always want to have assumptions made about their need for help.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think there&#39;s a difference between politeness and kindness.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think Katherine&#39;s right about that. People can be incredibly mean  <br/>
under the guise of politeness. It&#39;s a sneaky way to get at someone,  <br/>
while appearing completely appropriate.<br/>
<br/>
It would be a kindness to coach your daughter through this. You may be  <br/>
able to suss out her feelings through casual talk or when you cuddle  <br/>
up for a story.  You could help her see, when she&#39;s ready, that there  <br/>
are better ways to respond to others and to communicate her needs. You  <br/>
do a kindness to her to model kind behavior. You&#39;re her mom. She looks  <br/>
to you for guidance, whether you know it (or like it) or not.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-228228725">I won&#39;t respond to everyone&#39;s suggestions individually, but thank you!  They were all helpful in a variety of ways.  <br/>
<br/>
I did want to respond to this that Sandra said:<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Then stop making suggestions.  Find a different way to communicate.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Then I did this:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Read a little, try a little, wait a while, watch.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And yesterday I focused on being really patient and aware and engaged.  I looked for patterns, but didn&#39;t find any because she only had that NO! reaction I originally posted about one time.  Go figure!  lol  So, that could well be the pattern-  when I&#39;m tired, disengaged and not being aware enough she acts like that.  duh!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this morning she yelled at her sister &quot;Get off my chair&quot; to which I have responded in the past with giving her more appropriate words to use like &quot;please get off&quot; while I am moving to move her sister.  This time I didn&#39;t say anything to her, instead I spoke to her sister and said &quot;Ezabella is trying to say Liliana please move,&quot; and then helped Liliana move.<br/>
<br/>
Also, when her sister was in front of the tv and Ezabella yelled &quot;MOVE!&quot; I didn&#39;t say anything to her, I just spoke to Liliana and said &quot;Ezabella is asking you to move please&quot; and then helped her move.  <br/>
<br/>
What do you think?  It almost feels passive agressive, but I really don&#39;t mean it that way.  I have done this with both my kids when they were one and two years old because it&#39;s like giving them the words when they don&#39;t have the words yet.  I felt like my 4 year old SHOULD have the words, but obviously she doesn&#39;t always.  So I&#39;m trying to use it to partner with her and be her voice when she is having a hard time expressing things politely.  I hope it comes across that way to her.<br/>

well to that. Don&#39;t try to train her. Ask yourself, am I saying or doing <br/>
this to try to train her or because it is honest and kind and sensible <br/>
right now in this minute.<br/>
<br/>
What I think you probably need is to think more from your daughter&#39;s <br/>
point of view. Ask yourself what SHE is probably thinking at the moment <br/>
she&#39;s yelling.<br/>
<br/>
What did you think she would think when you repeated her request  for <br/>
her sister to move, but more nicely?<br/>
<br/>
  Do you think she was thinking, &quot;Oh THAT&#39;s nicer, I should ask that way <br/>
next time?&quot;  Really?<br/>
<br/>
If anything, she was probably thinking, &quot;Mommy is making fun of me,&quot; or <br/>
&quot;Mommy doesn&#39;t get how in the way my little sister is,&quot; or &quot;Mommy <br/>
doesn&#39;t care that I&#39;m angry, she wants me to stifle it.&quot; (Okay - not in <br/>
those words - in more raw and harsh words, probably.)<br/>
<br/>
Read - &quot;How to Talk So Your Child will Listen and HOw to Listen So Your <br/>
Child will Talk.&quot; It isn&#39;t the perfect book - but it might help you get <br/>
a sense of what a child&#39;s internal response might be to typical <br/>
parenting, as opposed to what you might be imagining or wishing the <br/>

<br/>
That would be manipulation!  My neighbor kids practice that all the time, in <br/>
very nicey nice ways!  So far, the only kids that Margaux has played with that <br/>
haven&#39;t been that way are other unschooled kids.  That doesn&#39;t mean those kids <br/>
don&#39;t exist, just not in MY neighborhood apparently!  Margaux is learning how to <br/>
be kind or at least walk away in the face of that sort of manipulation.  She <br/>
feels it deeply, but sometimes it sidelines her and she gets angry without <br/>
really being able to process WHY she is angry.  A good response that works well <br/>
in lots of situations that evoke a strong emotional response without <br/>
understanding why is &quot;I don&#39;t like that!&quot;, and then walking away until you can <br/>
figure out why it is you don&#39;t like that.  Margaux usually ads, &quot;you&#39;re mean and <br/>
I don&#39;t want to play with you anymore!&quot;, which is a huge step better than what <br/>
she used to do, &quot;You&#39;re f...ing rude and you&#39;re not my friend anymore, I hate <br/>
you!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Using the &quot;F&quot; word got Margaux banned from playing with some of those kids, <br/>
which was a bit of a blessing in disguise.  A month or so later though, on her <br/>
own volition, she went over and apologized for using curse words and had a <br/>
lovely rationale behind her whole thought process!  She decided that since she&#39;d <br/>
like to play with those kids SOMEtimes, then she should apologize, even if she <br/>
felt like using curse words wasn&#39;t really a bad thing, and even IF what they <br/>
were doing was far worse than using curse words.  Now when she slips up and uses <br/>
a curse word, the kids&#39; immediate response is, &quot;you&#39;re going to hell, and I&#39;m <br/>
going to go tell on you!&quot;, to which Margaux says, &quot;fine, go tell, and maybe I&#39;ll <br/>
mention what you just did/said when your mom comes over, and by the way, you <br/>
don&#39;t go to hell for saying curse words.&quot;<br/>

those words - in more raw and harsh words, probably.)-=-<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I&#39;ve done something almost just like that, though, with the  <br/>
thought of saving face for my team-member. Especially when Kirby was  <br/>
little and would start to arch and cry if I picked him up from a  <br/>
playsession, I might, while holding his arching crying body, say &quot;I  <br/>
think this means he had a really nice time!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He got the idea that a nicer way to leave was to say &quot;I had a nice  <br/>
time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t care if it was somewhat manipulative.  I wasn&#39;t concerning  <br/>
myself with what he thought of it at the time.  It was time to go, it  <br/>
wasn&#39;t my house, maybe I had a baby in the car waiting, and I wanted  <br/>
to reassure and thank the family that his crying seemed to be an  <br/>
indication that he would rather stay than go.  See ya Wednesday!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never been impressed when a parent shut down all the lives around  <br/>
to allow a child to take as much time as he wanted to leave.  Not when  <br/>
it&#39;s my house, especially, and the fit is disturbing the peace.  Not  <br/>
that I think the fit is better in the car, but if the purpose of the  <br/>
enactment is to get to stay, and the answer is no, especially when  <br/>
it&#39;s no because the host family has something else to do, or perhaps  <br/>
even is just tired of the kid because it&#39;s already been three or four  <br/>
hours, the child should be taken away.<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s also my experience that when the child IS away from the scene  <br/>
of the wishing-it-were-different situation, the tears and fit start.   <br/>
Like Homer with a donut, they&#39;ll see something else or get interested  <br/>
in food, or fall asleep in the car.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
When faced with a situation where my child&#39;s yelling is in the face or  <br/>
space of another person, my first thought is to soothe and protect the  <br/>
other child.  And if the other child is also my child, for sure that  <br/>
child has as much or more right to parental understanding as the  <br/>
agressor does.  BUT... better than everything above is for the mom to  <br/>
find ways to avoid melt-downs, and that&#39;s what this list can help with  <br/>
best.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than discuss 100 scenarios of what happens AFTER the mom  <br/>
neglects to prepare, we do better here to discuss how to prepare.   <br/>
This isn&#39;t a list about training children.  It&#39;s about living with  <br/>
children in such ways that they are learning and feeling peaceful and  <br/>
joyful.<br/>

then everyone can see from their chosen locations&quot;.  That way, everyone is clear <br/>
that both parties could move to see, even Ezabella.   Ezabella is, in a way, <br/>
expressing her power.  She CAN get what she wants and you can help her do that, <br/>
but not at the expense of a younger sibling, because that has the huge potential <br/>
to backfire if the younger sibling decides to contest those demands.<br/>

even kind and courteous) in the face of rudeness and manipulation<br/>
meant to police her (lack of) certain very specific kinds of courtesy.<br/>

responding.<br/>

to leave because it&#39;s wonderful to stay) and assist in some way that<br/>
voices or at least partly accomplishes when possible/feasible what the<br/>
child wants (say the child had a good time; or in my case last week,<br/>
suggest Karl and I go hang out at the playground since the kids had<br/>
left the playroom and the sitter wanted to go too).<br/>
<br/>
I love seeing that Margaux is doing this kind of thing at a very young<br/>
age! That&#39;s exciting to me. I see Karl doing some of that too but he&#39;s<br/>
younger and is just now noticing some things about his<br/>
friends/relatives that conflict all kinds of ways.<br/>

&gt; That would be manipulation!  My neighbor kids practice that all the time, in<br/>
&gt; very nicey nice ways!  So far, the only kids that Margaux has played with that<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t been that way are other unschooled kids.  That doesn&#39;t mean those kids<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t exist, just not in MY neighborhood apparently!  Margaux is learning how to<br/>
&gt; be kind or at least walk away in the face of that sort of manipulation.  She<br/>
&gt; feels it deeply, but sometimes it sidelines her and she gets angry without<br/>
&gt; really being able to process WHY she is angry.  A good response that works well<br/>
&gt; in lots of situations that evoke a strong emotional response without<br/>
&gt; understanding why is &quot;I don&#39;t like that!&quot;, and then walking away until you can<br/>
&gt; figure out why it is you don&#39;t like that.  Margaux usually ads, &quot;you&#39;re mean and<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t want to play with you anymore!&quot;, which is a huge step better than what<br/>
&gt; she used to do, &quot;You&#39;re f...ing rude and you&#39;re not my friend anymore, I hate<br/>
&gt; you!&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Using the &quot;F&quot; word got Margaux banned from playing with some of those kids,<br/>
&gt; which was a bit of a blessing in disguise.  A month or so later though, on her<br/>
&gt; own volition, she went over and apologized for using curse words and had a<br/>
&gt; lovely rationale behind her whole thought process!  She decided that since she&#39;d<br/>
&gt; like to play with those kids SOMEtimes, then she should apologize, even if she<br/>
&gt; felt like using curse words wasn&#39;t really a bad thing, and even IF what they<br/>
&gt; were doing was far worse than using curse words.  Now when she slips up and uses<br/>
&gt; a curse word, the kids&#39; immediate response is, &quot;you&#39;re going to hell, and I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; going to go tell on you!&quot;, to which Margaux says, &quot;fine, go tell, and maybe I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; mention what you just did/said when your mom comes over, and by the way, you<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t go to hell for saying curse words.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
I might pause it, but I would tell the kid who demanded &quot;MOVE!&quot; that  <br/>
she needs to grow up, get a house and buy a TV if she wants to tell  <br/>
someone else to MOVE.  And if the kid were old enough, I might say  <br/>
&quot;But you&#39;ll probably be able to see, because nobody&#39;s going to visit  <br/>
you if you treat them that way.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t say it as a hateful threat, but in a humorous informational  <br/>
way.  Just as we had the deal for years that Holly could hit Marty on  <br/>
her 18th birthday, but not before that.  And Marty said for years that  <br/>
he was not going to go to Holly&#39;s 18th birthday.  It was a way to joke  <br/>
about her frustration and his culpability.<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe respond in the VERY same tone of voice &quot;STAY THERE!&quot; to the  <br/>
kid who was told to move.  If it shocks them both, they&#39;ll be thinking.<br/>
<br/>
To act in any way as though it&#39;s peachy keen to say &quot;MOVE!&quot; to  <br/>
someone, though, is aiding and abetting.  If it&#39;s a two year old,  <br/>
yeah--they&#39;re practicing talking.   But with older kids, they&#39;re  <br/>
making a bullyish power play.  (Or they&#39;re tired or hungry or feeling  <br/>
ignored, but if those are eliminated and if it&#39;s happening really  <br/>
often toward a sibling, it&#39;s probably good not to help them prolong  <br/>
their habitual behavior.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, no one has ever been four years old longer than a  <br/>
year.<br/>
On the other hand, there&#39;s no reason to cause a toddler sibling to  <br/>
wait patiently a few years for an older child&#39;s desire to be pushy to  <br/>
subside at geological speed.<br/>

<br/>
Margaux has, on occasion, insisted on sitting in a specific location and <br/>
insisting everyone around her move so that she can see, when it would have been <br/>
much much easier to have chosen a better location to begin with.  There have <br/>
been times that she has refused to move and the suggestion for people to shift <br/>
just a bit has been a much more peaceful solution than to force all to move, <br/>
including the one who chose the location in which she couldn&#39;t see.   This was <br/>
when she was younger.  Now that she is 8, she&#39;s much better about sitting in a <br/>
location that she can see AND not causing other people to move or put in a <br/>
position where they feel they must move so as to not listen to a screaming 4 or <br/>
5 yr old.<br/>
<br/>
That is where I was coming from.  If a kid is sitting on the couch and watching <br/>
TV and her little sister has decided to stand directly in front of the TV, <br/>
that&#39;s a different thing.   <br/>

&gt; well to that. Don&#39;t try to train her. Ask yourself, am I saying or doing <br/>
&gt; this to try to train her or because it is honest and kind and sensible <br/>
&gt; right now in this minute.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m really thinking hard about you saying it&#39;s manipulative.  If I was using it to make her start using certain words right now, that would be manipulative.  But I really truly do want to be her partner in this!  I felt like this was a way to help her get what she needs and let others know what she is trying to express and be her polite words when she is having a hard time finding them.  I know I&#39;m the one who used the term passive aggressive and I think she might feel it is if I use that tone of voice, so I&#39;m not totally stuck on the idea.  However, I&#39;m hoping that if I do it in a way that lets her know I&#39;m helping her get her needs met, it will help.  I wasn&#39;t thinking of it as &quot;training&quot; her.  I was thinking of it as being her words when she didn&#39;t have the words.<br/>
<br/>
Manipulative is the parents who use sticker charts every time their kids is polite.  Enough stickers and they get an icecream.  Or the ones who refuse to hand them something and hold it inches out of reach and say &quot;use your words,&quot; &quot;what&#39;s the magic word?&quot;     <br/>

&gt; she&#39;s yelling.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think she is probably using the only words she can come up with in that moment to express her feelings of frustration at the situation.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What did you think she would think when you repeated her request  for <br/>

&gt; next time?&quot;  Really?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was hoping that she would see that there is a way to get her needs met and express what she wanted AND be polite about it.  I was hoping that I was modeling how to go about doing that.  She&#39;s 4, so no, I didn&#39;t think that she would think about it in so many words.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; If anything, she was probably thinking, &quot;Mommy is making fun of me,&quot; or <br/>
&gt; &quot;Mommy doesn&#39;t get how in the way my little sister is,&quot; or &quot;Mommy <br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t care that I&#39;m angry, she wants me to stifle it.&quot; (Okay - not in <br/>
&gt; those words - in more raw and harsh words, probably.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t imagine why she would be thinking any of those things.  I didn&#39;t say it in a mocking voice.  I obviously understood how her little sister was in the way because I made her move.  I didn&#39;t say anything negative about her anger.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Read - &quot;How to Talk So Your Child will Listen and HOw to Listen So Your <br/>
&gt; Child will Talk.&quot; It isn&#39;t the perfect book - but it might help you get <br/>
&gt; a sense of what a child&#39;s internal response might be to typical <br/>
&gt; parenting, as opposed to what you might be imagining or wishing the <br/>
&gt; child&#39;s thoughts and feelings are.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have read it and it&#39;s been a long time, but I remember it being full of lots of scripts.  Those are helpful sometimes, but too often, for me, they can just get in the way of actually seeing my child and the situation and instead just falling back on the script.  <br/>

<br/>
It might be better to step back from the idea of helping her learn. If there&#39;s lots of courtesy and compassion in her life, directed at her, then she Will learn. In the moment, &quot;helping her learn&quot; can turn into a kind of lesson. That&#39;s the problem with &quot;giving children words&quot; - parents can get to stuck on the lesson, on &quot;helping them learn&quot; and miss what&#39;s going on from the child&#39;s perspective. <br/>
<br/>
In the moment, look for ways to foster a more peaceful situation from all perspectives. That *might* mean adding pleases and thank yous on the behalf of your child, to smooth the way for her with others. It *might* involve scooting one child over so the other can see, or offering a suggestion that helps the kids sort out a problem, or even saying &quot;Hey, don&#39;t yell at your sister like that&quot; if that will help the second child&#39;s feelings without sending the first over the edge. Hurt feelings don&#39;t grow relationships or help people learn - look for ways to help learning to happen rather than getting bogged down figuring out how to help an individual to learn. <br/>

&gt; I have read it and it&#39;s been a long time, but I remember it being full <br/>
&gt; of lots of scripts. Those are helpful sometimes, but too often, for <br/>
&gt; me, they can just get in the way of actually seeing my child and the <br/>
&gt; situation and instead just falling back on the script.<br/>

an idea of how an interaction might go - they are examples, not scripts <br/>
you are supposed to follow.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What &quot;others?&quot;  Only her sister, right?<br/>
<br/>
You think she was trying to find nicer words and couldn&#39;t find them?<br/>
<br/>
I think she was probably angry and was expressing exactly what she <br/>
intended to express. I bet there is something driving her crazy.<br/>
<br/>
When Sandra spoke for Kirby and said he meant he&#39;d had a good time, it <br/>
was a way of saying thank you to the hosts and an easing of a social <br/>
situation. If Kirby picked up from that on how to be more polite, then <br/>
that was just one little tiny piece of lots of ways he got that in his <br/>
life. But, if he was upset and being fussy, I doubt it really made much <br/>
impact.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m responding to the idea of it being used as a regular technique <br/>
throughout the day, day after day.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve known a lot of parents who constantly did this kind of thing. <br/>
They&#39;re child says something, the parent repeats it but more politely or <br/>
more correctly.  Drives me crazy. In the cereal aisle in the store today <br/>
a dad and little boy, maybe 3 or 4. Child says, &quot;I want Rice Krispies,&quot; <br/>
Dad says, &quot;You want Rice Krispies, please.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  The most important is to create an environment in which she isn&#39;t <br/>
angry - which means trying to figure out why she IS angry in the first <br/>
place. Happy and content little girls tend to be mostly kind and nice. <br/>
What can you do to make her life better?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not, by the way, saying to ignore her rudeness. There are lots of <br/>
other ways to respond to it, though. I&#39;m pretty direct - I&#39;d probably <br/>
say straight up, &quot;Hey, don&#39;t be rude,&quot; or &quot;No yelling,&quot; or &quot;You could <br/>
have asked a lot nicer.&quot; And I&#39;d have said to the other child, who, by <br/>
the way IS also being rude to get between someone and the tv that they <br/>
are watching, &quot;Move out of the way,&quot; or &quot;Scootch over,&quot; or &quot;Come sit <br/>
here,&quot; or maybe even just, &quot;Pay attention to where you are.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My little sister used to get in front of the tv to annoy me. She&#39;d walk <br/>
in super slow motion across in front ot it and when I&#39;d yell at her to <br/>
move she&#39;d say, &quot;I&#39;m JUST walking by.&quot; I&#39;d yell because I was angry that <br/>
she was doing this and getting away with something again.  I&#39;d be the <br/>
bad guy for yelling, but she&#39;d have been doing annoying things like that <br/>
to me for hours. I&#39;d actually have exercised great restraint by just <br/>
yelling.<br/>
