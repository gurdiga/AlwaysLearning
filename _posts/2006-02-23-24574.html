<div id="ygrps-yiv-1334433091">Thank you Arlynn. That was a much needed big bump on the head :o) I agree, <br/>
time does not heal all wounds and it is true, the good memories slip back in <br/>
among the losses and there is comfort with those memories.<br/>
I hope you don&#39;t mind, I printed your post and put it on the frig.<br/>
