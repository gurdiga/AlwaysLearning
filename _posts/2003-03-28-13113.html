&gt; behind me and over my head people are shouting &quot;HALFWAY SUCKS!  KEEP MOVING <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; THIS WAY NOW!&quot;<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s a bad thing, but I can say it&#39;s very, very different. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
If she&#39;s doing her job, the student will soon bypass his teacher?<br/>
<br/>
Congratulations! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

But I wasn&#39;t intending to...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh never mind.<br/>
Damn that free will and respect crap.<br/>
<br/>
There ARE places I still would like to be controlling. &lt;g&gt; See?   Admission <br/>
