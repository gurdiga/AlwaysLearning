<div id="ygrps-yiv-597907611">What I&#39;m doing is being somewhat documented here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandraeurope2011.blogspot.com">http://sandraeurope2011.blogspot.com</a><br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve slept in nine different places in three weeks.  It&#39;s a big adventure.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m hoping that having readers from all around the world will provide someone who can help with this mystery:<br/>

<br/>
Tree grown from pip/seed planted from an unusual new fruit eaten by Bea Marshall three years ago.  The tree grew.  She still doesn&#39;t know what it is.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, back home: <br/>
Marty is housesitting in a big house for a week.  I&#39;m guessing his girlfriend is helping him some.<br/>
<br/>
Holly has a serious boyfriend, named Will.  I met him very briefly twice before I left, but they were not an item then.  In love, both of them. He&#39;s a guitarist in a band, but in some of the photos I&#39;ve seen he&#39;s playing bass.   Guitarists are good.  He&#39;s also very artistic, she says.  He&#39;s not at all tall.  He&#39;s Holly&#39;s size.  So they can share clothes. :-)  Good.  <br/>
<br/>
Kirby missed a promotion, but then has been given that position temporarily, partnered with someone else, so he&#39;ll have that much more experience (and they&#39;ll know how he actually can do) if another real position opens up.  But his hours are 5:30 pm to 3:30 am, so once again it looks like his sleep schedule WAS preparing him for future jobs. :-)  Also he and Erik his roommate and Erik&#39;s girlfriend moved to another house nearer to Blizzard&#39;s new facility (they were leasing before, on the far other side of Austin).<br/>
<br/>
Keith&#39;s shoulder is stronger than before the surgery.  There&#39;s always that frustrating time of early recovery when it&#39;s worse than just before, but he&#39;s passed the point.  He bought another used car to replace the Ford Taurus Holly was in when she was rearended.  He got a Toyota Prius, five or six years old.  I&#39;m looking forward to having my own van for my own self someday.  Holly&#39;s driving it, while I&#39;m gone, with its flying Hanuman hanging from the rearview mirror.  We&#39;ll share it, when I get back.  But she also has a boyfriend with a car.<br/>
<br/>
And that is how my family is doing, because I&#39;m able to talk to them by phone from my computer with Skype, or with Holly, video chat on Skype.  THAT makes travelling less distant.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in a street-facing second-story room in Derby, with a bowling club (bowls lawn?) outside the window, and a couple of guys have come and are playing.  That&#39;s cool.  I&#39;ve kept looking out there, like looking for birds.  They&#39;re there!<br/>

it was that. :)  Next best guess would be some kind of guava?  I know I&#39;ve <br/>
seen something like it before, but can&#39;t quite put my finger on it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-596373858">Hi All<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for helping out - this is an exciting group - looking forward to meeting you all more!  <br/>
<br/>
The fruit had one single stone, not as big as an avocado stone though.  <br/>
<br/>
If this helps at all, I treated it much like an avocado when it started growing and pinched out the second set of leaves.  But the plant / tree really didn&#39;t like me doing that!  It slowed up for a while until it could find a new bit of &#39;trunk&#39; to grow from.  Since then I&#39;ve just let it be - it&#39;s still alive despite two harsh winters and an unexpected May hail storm!<br/>

If she&#39;d had the fruit, she wouldn&#39;t need the answer. :-)<br/>
<br/>
She ate a fruit she didn&#39;t know the name of, planted one of the &quot;pips&quot; (so a small seed) and that&#39;s what grew.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1296894554">This is really ringing bells! The fruit seems incredibly familiar but the seed / stone is spot on to what I remember! In the morning I&#39;ll go and take a closer look at the leaves as there are some new ones coming through I think and the wiki link had a good description!<br/>
<br/>
hooray!  although I&#39;m not sure the north of england is the best climate to expect fruit any time soon ;)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-995658510">We had a loquat tree  when I was young, grown from seed, which looked<br/>
exactly like Sandra&#39;s picture. I&#39;ve been racking my brains to try and<br/>
remember what it was, so thank you!<br/>
<br/>
Ours grew to about four feet tall over several years, in a pot in our front<br/>
porch. It got infested several times with scale insects - it must have had a<br/>
weakness that way because none of the other plants ever had a problem with<br/>
them. My sister forgot to water it after I got married and moved out.<br/>
