<div id="ygrps-yiv-801880625">I feel a sort of  ... calling ... now and then to<br/>
speak or write to other mothers (particularly in the<br/>
Christian community) about respectful parenting and<br/>
possibly unschooling, depending on the audience.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking about local, simple things, like talking<br/>
to a MOPS (Mothers of PreSchoolers) group, or a<br/>
women&#39;s seminar at a church, or a local homeschooling<br/>
group, that kind of thing.<br/>
<br/>
I realize that the idea of addressing the Christian<br/>
community may be asking for trouble, but I tend to<br/>
believe there are women out there, like myself, who<br/>
would respond to it like a breath of fresh air.<br/>
<br/>
I also realize that since my oldest child is not quite<br/>
seven, some people may not impressed by anything I<br/>
have to say, and I may have to wait a few years yet<br/>
before I have any credibility.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway ... for Sandra and anyone else with experience<br/>
in this area:<br/>
<br/>
1) When, where, and how did you start publicly<br/>
speaking about parenting and unschooling? Did someone<br/>
approach you to speak, or did you prepare a speech and<br/>
tell people about it?<br/>
<br/>
2) When did you feel like you had enough experience to<br/>
be able to help others (or just to get people to<br/>
listen to you?)<br/>
<br/>
3) What&#39;s a good way to develop an outline/topic/etc?<br/>
What usually sparked an idea?<br/>
<br/>
4) Any advice for someone like me, who feels like I<br/>
might have something to offer someone, even if it&#39;s<br/>
years down the road?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much<br/>

<br/>
People invited me after I wrote online for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
If there&#39;s a local group you&#39;re part of that puts on a conference,  <br/>
the people there who know you might accept an offer for you to speak,  <br/>
or you could ask them.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes local groups have  monthly get-togethers or intros for new  <br/>
homeschoolers, and that&#39;s a possibility.<br/>

Of course, now some probably say, &quot;Oh yeah? She doesn&#39;t remember what  <br/>
it was like to have young children.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t forgotten, and I know Sandra hasn&#39;t either. We were so  <br/>
focused on what we were doing, paid attention, talked and wrote about  <br/>
it so much - we remember it very clearly.<br/>

<br/>
Rather than taking your message to people you think might want to  <br/>
hear it, take your message to where people are already asking to hear  <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
You make your goal a whole lot harder to reach by trying to change  <br/>
people who may not be ready to change. It&#39;s an exercise in frustration!<br/>
<br/>
Talk to people who already want to hear what you&#39;re talking about and  <br/>
it will give you a lot more confidence to speak to people who are  <br/>
willing to listen but not sure they want to change yet.<br/>

<br/>
I had another idea about this.<br/>
<br/>
You could have a blog dedicated to the things you&#39;re feeling drawn to  <br/>
share.  Write there, and participate in as many Christian discussions  <br/>
as you can find and when a topic comes up that you&#39;ve already blogged  <br/>
about, you could send them a link to that one blog post.   That would  <br/>
get them to your blog to read other things, and it would keep you  <br/>
from feeling you were disrupting a more conventional, conservative  <br/>
flow by bringing the whole counter-argument there.<br/>
<br/>
The way to become a voice in the unschooling community is to BE a  <br/>
voice.    I&#39;ve seen some people try to self-promote when other  <br/>
unschoolers are saying &quot;Who?&quot; (or &quot;oh, no...&quot;).   It&#39;s better to  <br/>
become a known, regular voice than to be quiet for years and then  <br/>
apply to conferences for the opportunity to speak.<br/>
<br/>
Putting ideas out in public is like putting rocks in a rock  <br/>
polisher.  They roll around and the rough edges are smoothed off.<br/>
<br/>
If there&#39;s anyone here who&#39;s never been around a rock polisher, I  <br/>
should add that it&#39;s noisy and takes a long time.  Weeks.    A month  <br/>
sometimes, if you want something very smooth.<br/>
<br/>
Ideas that haven&#39;t been out in public and turned over and run through  <br/>
lots of other people&#39;s ideas aren&#39;t good ideas for presenting in  <br/>
talks.  Or when I do throw out an untried, new idea I make it as  <br/>
clear as I can that it&#39;s just something I&#39;ve been thinking about  <br/>
lately, or something I&#39;m planning to try, so it doesn&#39;t get mixed in  <br/>
with the things that I&#39;ve been polishing for 17 years.<br/>
<br/>
