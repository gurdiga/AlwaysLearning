<div id="ygrps-yiv-1466156756">So...<br/>
My first reaction to the e-mail below is to write and say &quot;That goes against <br/>
the whole idea, and that information is available free ANYday.&quot;   But are <br/>
there some people who would much rather take a single organized course on <br/>
unschooling (like they would like to buy one book and read it and have done) instead <br/>
of poke around and get their information freeform?  If so, is it good for me to <br/>
list this link?  I don&#39;t want to be antagonistic about it, and I think it&#39;s <br/>
cool that they&#39;re offering an unschooling session.<br/>
<br/>
Some years back HEM was thinking of doing such online classes and I was asked <br/>
if I would teach online classes.  I said it seemed counter to the whole <br/>
principle, but if they really wanted to I would.  They abandoned plan. But maybe <br/>
that wasn&#39;t the best thing.<br/>

<br/>
What do you all think?<br/>

<br/>
Hello Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Irene Taylor and I am the dean of the School of Education and<br/>
the Kids&#39; School at Suite University, a part of suite101.com <br/>
<br/>
I am writing to let you know about several of our courses in the hope that<br/>
you might be able to include them on your Radical Unschooling site. I<br/>
learned of your site through a link at one of our courses Homeschooling the<br/>
Unschooling Way by Sara McGrath. Here is a link to that course:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.suite101.com/course.cfm/19413/overview/40168">http://www.suite101.com/course.cfm/19413/overview/40168</a><br/>
<br/>
Sara has listed your site as a resource in several parts of her course, so<br/>
I was hoping that you might be willing to give us a reciprocal link or<br/>
announce some of our other courses.<br/>
<br/>
Here are our course offerings in the homeschool area:<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling the Unschooling Way:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.suite101.com/course.cfm/19413/overview/40168">http://www.suite101.com/course.cfm/19413/overview/40168</a><br/>
<br/>
Parents who plan to homeschool their young children, and parents interested<br/>
in supporting child-led learning outside of school hours, will learn about<br/>
the unschooling philosophy of home education including all the details and<br/>
variations of how this style of homeschooling fits into daily living and<br/>
how state regulations can be followed and satisfied. <br/>
<br/>
This course begins on Jan. 24, or anytime as a Quick Course.<br/>
<br/>
How to Start Homeschooling:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.suite101.com/course.cfm/16658/overview/40168">http://www.suite101.com/course.cfm/16658/overview/40168</a><br/>
<br/>
Thinking about homeschooling your children? Perhaps you&#39;ve begun<br/>
homeschooling but are looking for more resources. How to Start<br/>
Homeschooling is a soup to nuts guide covering all of the basics: from<br/>
getting started to high school and beyond.<br/>
<br/>
You will learn the laws for your state and how to meet the state curriculum<br/>
guidelines. You will learn how to deal with criticism, and how to find the<br/>
method of homeschooling that is right for you and your family. <br/>
<br/>
This course starts on Feb. 13, or anytime as a Quick Course<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling Your Special Needs Child:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.suite101.com/course.cfm/17312/overview/40168">http://www.suite101.com/course.cfm/17312/overview/40168</a><br/>
<br/>
From the first stages of the decision-making process to the first exciting<br/>
and scary days as a homeschooling parent, this course helps parents prepare<br/>
to teach their own child at home and to cope with the unique challenges<br/>
faced by any parent teaching a special child.<br/>
<br/>
This course starts on Feb. 13, or anytime as a Quick Course.<br/>
<br/>
We also have three new courses that were written just for children. These<br/>
could be used as part of a homeschool program, or to supplement<br/>
instruction. They are all available at any time as Quick Courses. This is a<br/>
growing school and we are also always looking for new course developers.<br/>
<br/>
What is it and How to Cope:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.suite101.com/course.cfm/19244/overview/40168">http://www.suite101.com/course.cfm/19244/overview/40168</a><br/>
<br/>
In this course you will learn all about bullying - what it is, different<br/>
types of bullying, who bullies, why a bully bullies, and how best to cope<br/>
with bullying. It will help you learn to cope with the challenge of being<br/>
bullied and teach you how to react to bullying. This course is recommended<br/>
for children between the ages of 8 & 12. Parental supervision is advised,<br/>
but not necessary. <br/>
<br/>
Christianity for Kids:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.suite101.com/course.cfm/19359/overview/40168">http://www.suite101.com/course.cfm/19359/overview/40168</a><br/>
<br/>
Have you ever wondered what being a Christian means and how to become a<br/>
Christian? This course is designed to teach you the wonders of God&#39;s love<br/>
and take the mystery out of being a Christian. You will learn what the<br/>
Bible is and why it was written. In addition, you will learn about prayer.<br/>
And, you will see the exciting events of Jesus&#39; life, and the huge<br/>
sacrifice he made for us. This course is designed for children ages 6-8,<br/>
with parental involvement. <br/>
<br/>
Kitchen Safety for Kids:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.suite101.com/course.cfm/19315/overview/40168">http://www.suite101.com/course.cfm/19315/overview/40168</a><br/>
<br/>
There are many hazards in the kitchen. If you are between the ages of 8 &<br/>
12, this course will educate you on basic kitchen safety, microwave safety,<br/>
fire extinguishers and how to use them, oven safety, appliance safety,<br/>
stovetop safety, food safety, using knives etc. This course should be taken<br/>
with adult supervision because kids will be working with stoves, microwaves<br/>
and knives.<br/>
<br/>
This course is recommended for kids between the ages of 8 & 12, who enjoy<br/>
working in the kitchen. Parental supervision is advised. <br/>
<br/>
I would very much appreciate any links to any of these courses at your<br/>
site, or permission to post an announcement of these courses on the<br/>
appropriate message boards that you have, if a link is not possible. We<br/>
feel that these courses all offer a great deal to the homeschooler, and<br/>
we&#39;d like to spread the word about them if possible.<br/>
<br/>
If you have any questions, please contact me. Thanks so much for your<br/>
consideration.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1978219583">Thanks for putting this out for us to look at Sandra. I think that before<br/>
you put a link on your site, you should know how the course was going to<br/>
taught. By putting the link up, it is like you are endorsing it, and<br/>
possibly it won&#39;t be a good representation of unschooling. If you think it<br/>
will be a good representation for unschooling, then it might be another good<br/>
way to help parents come to unschool their children.<br/>
<br/>
This description from the link: &quot;will learn about the unschooling philosophy<br/>
of home education including all the details and variations of how this style<br/>
of homeschooling fits into daily living and how state regulations can be<br/>
followed and satisfied.&quot; sounds pretty darn schooly, and I&#39;m not sure how<br/>
one would neatly display unschooling fitting into daily living, since each<br/>
day is different (I hope!) and each home is different. But maybe they have<br/>
ideas about this that would work.<br/>
<br/>
So there&#39;s my two cents, for what they&#39;re worth!<br/>

  to teach their own child at home and to cope with the unique challenges<br/>
  faced by any parent teaching a special child.<br/>
<br/>
  This course starts on Feb. 13, or anytime as a Quick Course.<br/>
<br/>
  We also have three new courses that were written just for children. These<br/>
  could be used as part of a homeschool program, or to supplement<br/>
  instruction. They are all available at any time as Quick Courses. This is<br/>
a<br/>
  growing school and we are also always looking for new course developers.<br/>
<br/>
  What is it and How to Cope:<br/>

<br/>
  In this course you will learn all about bullying - what it is, different<br/>
  types of bullying, who bullies, why a bully bullies, and how best to cope<br/>
  with bullying. It will help you learn to cope with the challenge of being<br/>
  bullied and teach you how to react to bullying. This course is recommended<br/>
  for children between the ages of 8 & 12. Parental supervision is advised,<br/>
  but not necessary.<br/>
<br/>
  Christianity for Kids:<br/>

<br/>
  Have you ever wondered what being a Christian means and how to become a<br/>
  Christian? This course is designed to teach you the wonders of God&#39;s love<br/>
  and take the mystery out of being a Christian. You will learn what the<br/>
  Bible is and why it was written. In addition, you will learn about prayer.<br/>
  And, you will see the exciting events of Jesus&#39; life, and the huge<br/>
  sacrifice he made for us. This course is designed for children ages 6-8,<br/>
  with parental involvement.<br/>
<br/>
  Kitchen Safety for Kids:<br/>

<br/>
  There are many hazards in the kitchen. If you are between the ages of 8 &<br/>
  12, this course will educate you on basic kitchen safety, microwave<br/>
safety,<br/>
  fire extinguishers and how to use them, oven safety, appliance safety,<br/>
  stovetop safety, food safety, using knives etc. This course should be<br/>
taken<br/>
  with adult supervision because kids will be working with stoves,<br/>
microwaves<br/>
  and knives.<br/>
<br/>
  This course is recommended for kids between the ages of 8 & 12, who enjoy<br/>
  working in the kitchen. Parental supervision is advised.<br/>
<br/>
  I would very much appreciate any links to any of these courses at your<br/>
  site, or permission to post an announcement of these courses on the<br/>
  appropriate message boards that you have, if a link is not possible. We<br/>
  feel that these courses all offer a great deal to the homeschooler, and<br/>
  we&#39;d like to spread the word about them if possible.<br/>
<br/>
  If you have any questions, please contact me. Thanks so much for your<br/>
  consideration.<br/>

  Subject: [AlwaysLearning] are courses good for getting to not needing courses?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  So...<br/>
  My first reaction to the e-mail below is to write and say &quot;That goes against <br/>
  the whole idea, and that information is available free ANYday.&quot;   But are <br/>
  there some people who would much rather take a single organized course on <br/>
  unschooling (like they would like to buy one book and read it and have done) instead <br/>
  of poke around and get their information freeform?  If so, is it good for me to <br/>
  list this link?  <br/>
  ********************************<br/>
<br/>
  I personally wouldn&#39;t put it on the texasunschoolers.com site unless I went through the course myself.  I&#39;m thinking you&#39;d probably want to do the same thing with your site, especially since so many people link to it and refer to it.  I&#39;m sure that you have read all the other things you link to on your site.  I also think that you are right, unschooling information is free and easy to find on the internet.  Yes, sometimes I wish your site were organized in a book that I could buy, but that&#39;s because I&#39;d like to get comfy on the couch with a book, instead of reading on the computer all the time.  It&#39;s also easier to lend a book than to say, hey, go check out this site.<br/>
<br/>
  The course might be fine, but unless you know for sure, I&#39;d recommend not recommending it.  When I see something at SandraDodd.com, I&#39;m pretty sure that you and other long-time unschoolers recognize it as being valid and worthy or reading/implementing.<br/>

What&#39;s the downside of linking?<br/>
=======<br/>
<br/>
That people might pay money for something they could have gotten free, I <br/>
guess.<br/>
And that I would be endorsing a whole &quot;school&quot; or set of clases, and <br/>
endorsing classes of any sort seems to go against helping people really believe that <br/>
classes are unnecessary.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the hoop snake problem.  If a snake bites its own tail...<br/>
<br/>
If people who haven&#39;t really gotten to unschooling take classes, they might <br/>
be more likely to press their kids to take classes, or wish for that, or worry <br/>
about that.<br/>
<br/>
It seems like a step back or sideways.  But is a workshop online all that <br/>
different from spending a long week here or at unschooling.com asking all the <br/>
same questions?  Is it much different from buying The Unschooling Handbook?   <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know.<br/>

  Ohh, yeah, that&#39;s kind of creepy.  Endorsing a whole school.  I think no.  Not good, until you research the school and the courses, and nah.  If someone were doing a workshop on their own site, but a bunch of other schooly things were not going on elsewhere on that site, it might be cool.  But that&#39;s not the sitch here.<br/>
<br/>
  It could start a bunch of other online schools creating the same courses and wanting your endorsements.  <br/>

  I disagree.  I think Sandra is so well-known in unschooling that she could greatly increase that number.  So many people recommend Sandra&#39;s site and she is seen as the radical unschooling guru.  If I send people to Sandra&#39;s site, which I do link to on my TexasUnschoolers site, then I am also sending people to the links she recommends, as do all the other people who link to her.<br/>
<br/>
  If I were new to unschooling and found a link for a school on Sandra&#39;s site, I&#39;d be likely to take the course.  Every course there furthers the school itself, and I don&#39;t know what else is going on there, but I&#39;d assume that Sandra does and agrees with it.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1282189623">I don&#39;t know who Sara McGrath is.  I googled her and found the links to<br/>
the courses.  I found a &quot;diaper free&quot; article but I didn&#39;t find any<br/>
unschooling bits.<br/>
<br/>
I think if people are looking for an unschooling course they can find it<br/>
on their own.  I Googled &quot;unschooling course&quot; and their links came right<br/>
up.  <br/>
<br/>
Linking to it is going to look like an endorsement unless you offer a<br/>
disclaimer.  If you feel you need a disclaimer linking to it might not be<br/>
the best choice. <br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s your criteria for linking to other sites?   <br/>
<br/>
It would be expensive to take all the courses in order to find out if<br/>
they&#39;re something you&#39;d feel ok about linking to.  <br/>
<br/>
If you linked to their course and they&#39;ve crappy information it could<br/>
tarnish your reputation or call into question the integrity of the rest<br/>
of your site.   Guilty by association. (in the minds of some, if they<br/>
matter.)<br/>

I am on their site, I guess.  There&#39;s a kind of &quot;buy now&quot; option (as it were) <br/>
on the class, where you can pay to read through the text (I think, if I <br/>
understood it).<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s not really a reciprocation situation.  They&#39;re making money, I&#39;m <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1160508887">FWIW, it sounds an awful lot like a nose sticking where it doesn&#39;t <br/>
belong, imo.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a big difference between being a big name in the Unschooling <br/>
world because you&#39;ve been there, done that, have lots of info up, give <br/>
conference talks, etc. and being an &quot;expert&quot; in the academic sense. <br/>
You&#39;ve purposely *not* bought into the expertise that the academy sells.<br/>
<br/>
I think that setting up a course like Unschooling 101, however many <br/>
people it may make Unschooling easier for, goes directly against the <br/>
idea that information is available for all who want it without depending <br/>
upon an expert to mediate that information. Plus, I&#39;m inclined to think <br/>
that anyone who&#39;s unwilling to search out information on their own and <br/>
views a course on Unschooling as the only, the best or even the easiest <br/>
way to get information has a *long* way to go before getting to <br/>
Unschooling and setting up such a course only fuels those misperceptions <br/>
and prolongs their journey.<br/>
<br/>
 I really do think there&#39;s a significant difference between signing  up <br/>
for courses that some expert teaches and that fall under the umbella of <br/>
a traditional school and attending an Unschooling conference or reading <br/>
on Unschooling.com. If they&#39;re linking you--cool. But, I can see <br/>
absolutely no ethical reason why you should link them in return.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d go with your first reaction: &quot; My first reaction to the e-mail below <br/>
is to write and say &quot;That goes against<br/>
the whole idea, and that information is available free ANYday.&quot;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But, that&#39;s just my $.02, obviously.<br/>

I can see your point, but I&#39;m guessing that people new to unschooling, and inclined to do a course, likely would find it elsewhere and spend the money whatever Sandra had to say about it.  But, on thinking about it, I agree that seeing such links at Sandradodd.com would be wrong.<br/>

Note the last few words, &quot;support natural learning _outside of school_&quot;--isn&#39;t <br/>
that antithetical to unschooling? This suggests that unschooling and (public/<br/>
traditional/bricks &#39;n mortar/etc) schooling are complementary. The words <br/>
also implicitly state that traditional school is the normalized, naturalized state <br/>
of being while unschooling is, by its suggested opposite to traditional school, <br/>
inferior and therefore the one expected to be shaped so that it still &quot;works <br/>
with&quot; traditional school.<br/>
<br/>
Food for thought.<br/>
