<div id="ygrps-yiv-1324422741">This is long, but everyone&#39;s fine.   Those with young children or who  <br/>
don&#39;t like long posts can skip it.<br/>
<br/>
My introduction is that each of our children has been in trouble with  <br/>
the law now.<br/>
Kirby drove his friend Joey home about four blocks, and he forgot to  <br/>
turn his headlights on.  We went to court and they let him pay the  <br/>
fine without talking to the judge.<br/>
<br/>
Marty was on a playground in a public park after hours (parks close at  <br/>
10:00 or 10:30)--not drinking, not doing anything but playing on the  <br/>
slides with three other people, one 21 and the others 18, 19.  He did  <br/>
two days of community service at the Red Cross office.  (He reminded  <br/>
me that he also was ticketed for stopping too hard at a stop light.   <br/>
He stopped, but not gracefully, and we went to court and he paid a  <br/>
fine and went to a driving class.  No alcohol nor any other such thing  <br/>
involved.)<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s is slightly worse than these.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Last night at 2:20 Holly (17) called on the house phone.  There&#39;s one  <br/>
by our bed.  She sounded like she was afraid and embarrassed, and said  <br/>
that the party had been busted, and she needed us to come and pick her  <br/>
up.  The police said she needed at least one parent to come.  And she  <br/>
was afraid she might have parked the car where it would have been  <br/>
towed.  She couldn&#39;t see it from where she was.<br/>
<br/>
So I woke Keith up and told him.  Keith had fallen asleep really early  <br/>
because he had been helping clean a group camping site in Edgewood for  <br/>
several hours Saturday morning and afternoon.   Brett had been  <br/>
planning to go to the party when I had gone to bed, but Brett had had  <br/>
a too-long day at work and had come home to discuss that and to play  <br/>
World of Warcraft.  (Brett is Holly&#39;s boyfriend, who&#39;s staying with  <br/>
us, for those new to the saga.)<br/>
<br/>
Brett&#39;s car was in the driveway and the house was dark, so we went out  <br/>
quietly.  I thought maybe he could be spared the worry, and it&#39;s  <br/>
possible that Holly wouldn&#39;t have wanted him there, but just us.<br/>
<br/>
I went back to get a big flannel sheet, because besides  &quot;bust&quot; Holly  <br/>
had also mentioned &quot;wrestling in pudding.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I knew where she was, because it was a house she&#39;d never been to  <br/>
before, hosting a party for a couple she&#39;s known separately a long  <br/>
time, and together.  One was having a birthday; the other had  <br/>
sufficiently recovered from a broken neck in a car accident (he&#39;s  <br/>
mobile), to share a party.  She had been scheduled to go to his  <br/>
birthday party a couple of months ago when he had the accident.    <br/>
Brett and I had helped (by phone) figure out exactly where the house  <br/>
was and how she could best get there from where she was after work.<br/>
<br/>
For those who know Albuquerque, we&#39;re near the mountains (Juan Tabo  <br/>
and Candelaria) and she was down past the university, across from  <br/>
Roosevelt Park.  It&#39;s eight miles or ten, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
As we were driving, we discussed what the best tack to take would be.   <br/>
We shouldn&#39;t be too cheery about it.  We weren&#39;t going to act harsher  <br/>
than we felt.  I was thinking at that time it might be a marijuana  <br/>
situation.<br/>
<br/>
A mile from the house Marty called.  He had been invited to the party,  <br/>
but had opted to go to a couple of parties his girlfriend had been  <br/>
invited to instead.   They were done there, and he had called to see  <br/>
if the birthday/recovery party was still on, and the birthday-person  <br/>
answered her cell from her car, where she was driving drunks home.    <br/>
She told Marty what she knew.  So I was relieved it was alcohol and  <br/>
pudding, rather than drugs.<br/>
<br/>
Holly had been the second youngest person at the party.   The sixteen  <br/>
year old girl was asked &quot;were you drinking?&quot; and she said &quot;no,&quot; so  <br/>
they said &quot;Go home.&quot;    Everyone over 21 who could prove it was told  <br/>
to go home.  (Holly&#39;s unsure if any of them got citations).  Holly had  <br/>
said yes, about drinking, so they told her to call her parents.  And  <br/>
Holly didn&#39;t know the other girl, nor several of the people at the  <br/>
party.<br/>
<br/>
The birthday hostess (not resident) had wanted to stay with Holly but  <br/>
the police told her she needed to leave and help get the intoxicated  <br/>
friends safely home.<br/>
<br/>
Marty (20, her brother) had been willing to go and get Holly, but I  <br/>
told him it needed to be a parent and we were already on the way.  So  <br/>
he said he and Ashlee-his-girlfriend would go on to our house.  I told  <br/>
him Brett didn&#39;t know yet, so maybe not to bother him with it but let  <br/>
Holly tell him, unless he asked directly.  I thought he was asleep.<br/>
<br/>
Just a minute or so later, Brett  (25, her boyfriend) called.  It was  <br/>
2:40 or so by then, and he had been just about to go to sleep but  <br/>
called Holly to see if she was okay and when she was coming back.    <br/>
The police let her answer the phone.  She told him we were on our way  <br/>
to get her, so I told him what I knew and that Marty was on his way  <br/>
home.<br/>
<br/>
At that point I thought how cool it was that we were all in such close  <br/>
communication.  The day I was in an accident a couple or three weeks  <br/>
ago, before I had left the scene, Keith and Holly and Brett were there  <br/>
with me.    Marty was at work, or he probably would&#39;ve been there too.<br/>
<br/>
We got to the house and she was sitting on the porch, chocolate  <br/>
pudding in her hair and everywhere, drying.  There were four  <br/>
policemen, and another one in the house.   Holly was the last one  <br/>
there besides the two who lived there. She was wearing a t-shirt and  <br/>
shorts, and was barefooted.  I wrapped the flannel sheet around her.   <br/>
Keith did the talking, and not much.  Everyone was courteous and  <br/>
somber but not tense.  Keith apologized and thanked them, and the one  <br/>
who was in charge of Holly before we got there  said they were just  <br/>
doing their jobs, and Keith said &quot;Well, I need to do mine too,&quot; and  <br/>
the guy said he was a parent too, and these things happen.   So there  <br/>
was no shaming or defensiveness or anything.   She was cited, and I  <br/>
can&#39;t read the details on our copy, but I think it&#39;s possession of  <br/>
alcohol by a minor.  Maybe it&#39;s consumption. It has a number I can&#39;t  <br/>
see well enough to look it up.<br/>
<br/>
Holly asked if she could go inside and go to the bathroom.  The  <br/>
officer said &quot;You&#39;re in the custody of your parents now--it&#39;s up to  <br/>
them.&quot;  We all looked at each other.  It wasn&#39;t my house; I didn&#39;t  <br/>
know the residents.  Keith said &quot;Go pee.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
While she was gone we talked a little.  There was a big dark smear on  <br/>
the bottom concrete step there by the front door.  I said &quot;I assume  <br/>
that&#39;s pudding, and not blood.&quot;  One of the cops said, &quot;Yeah.  There&#39;s  <br/>
pudding everywhere in there.    There&#39;s pudding on me.&quot;  Another one  <br/>
said &quot;There&#39;s pudding on my flashlight.&quot;    It would&#39;ve been funny,  <br/>
but we were all in straight-face, this isn&#39;t funny mode.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll be contacted by the juvenile probation department.  The  <br/>
policeman used the term &quot;intake,&quot; and I asked what that meant.  He  <br/>
said they&#39;ll want to determine whether she needs alcohol abuse  <br/>
treatment, and whether she&#39;s in a safe situation.  Okay.    I don&#39;t  <br/>
think homeschooling will be an issue, and she&#39;s old enough to drop out  <br/>
or graduate anyway, if she were in high school.   She has two part- <br/>
time jobs, and that will help (if they don&#39;t pull a child labor law  <br/>
trick out of the hat &lt;g&gt;).   She hasn&#39;t been in trouble, and that will  <br/>
help.  No damage to people or property.<br/>
<br/>
And the drinking she did was one jello shooter, and tastes of two  <br/>
other people&#39;s drinks.  She said she never had a drink of her own.  <br/>
There weren&#39;t any drinking games.  There were people there not  <br/>
drinking at all.<br/>
<br/>
She could have lied, but she didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
When she came out of the house she was crying--frustration and  <br/>
embarrassment kind of crying.  Stress.<br/>
<br/>
Things seemed to be a smooth as possible under the circumstances.    <br/>
When we were leaving, the police could leave, and the two guys who  <br/>
lived there walked them out too, and said good night and thanks and  <br/>
good bye, and Holly rode back with Keith in the van where the heater  <br/>
had been on, and I followed them back in the car.  When we got home  <br/>
she was crying, but I do know she told Keith some of the story on the  <br/>
way home and also talked to the birthday hostess to tell her she was  <br/>
okay.<br/>
<br/>
We got home and she went into the shower.  I took the pudding clothes  <br/>
and put them in the washing machine so I could turn it on right after  <br/>
she turned the shower off.  The laundry was her bikini top, the  <br/>
Punisher t-shirt her friend Jared had taken off and put on her so  <br/>
she&#39;d be wearing more than just a bikini top and shorts, another t- <br/>
shirt someone had offered up for people to wipe jello off of them, and  <br/>
she said she would bring back clean.   Her shorts and underwear, and  <br/>
the sheet.<br/>
<br/>
She was unsettled and lightly agitated.  I offered to sleep with her  <br/>
in the library and she gratefully took me up on that.   I closed down  <br/>
the house, re-ran the laundry, left notes so Keith and Brett would  <br/>
know where we were if they woke up, and went and fixed up that bed.   <br/>
So I curled up behind her and stroked her hair and her arm and told  <br/>
her I loved her and I was sorry she had cried, and she asked what I  <br/>
was thinking about it all, and how much trouble she might be in.    I  <br/>
told her there might be a fine, and she&#39;d probably have unsupervised  <br/>
probation, since nobody was hurt and there wasn&#39;t any malice.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know who all might&#39;ve been charged besides Holly and the  <br/>
resident hosts.  I&#39;m willing to provide follow-ups on this.  If I&#39;m  <br/>
going to be telling how wonderful our lives are, it&#39;s only fair to  <br/>
give some detail on the less than wonderful times.<br/>
<br/>
Ashlee (now 23) told me last night that when she was 15 she spent the  <br/>
night with a friend, and they got a ride to a party on the other end  <br/>
of town.  She grew up 20 miles north of here in Bernalillo, a little  <br/>
farm town two miles long.     The girls were walking home from the  <br/>
party, really late, and the police came and took each of them to her  <br/>
own home.  Ashlee&#39;s parents grounded her from watching MTV for a year,  <br/>
she said, because they were sure watching MTV had made her wild.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re not grounding Holly from anything.   We didn&#39;t congratulate her  <br/>
or make light of it, but she was fully remorseful and is more  <br/>
concerned about how we feel about it, and the inconvenience to us in  <br/>
the middle of the night,  than about her own outcome.  She&#39;ll be 18 in  <br/>
November, and juvenile offenses like this are wiped off, in New  <br/>
Mexico.  Or maybe it will be wiped when she&#39;s 21, or after the  <br/>
probationary period; I don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
The police seemed to have felt better after they asked Holly whether  <br/>
any of the girls were pudding-wrestling for money.    Holly didn&#39;t  <br/>
really understand the question, and I didn&#39;t even hear about it until  <br/>
later, but it makes more sense now, thinking back to when the youngest  <br/>
officer said &quot;It was a party activity,&quot; and I said &quot;Well I guess it&#39;s  <br/>
good it wasn&#39;t just her and one other girl,&quot; and he said &quot;No, they  <br/>
were all doing it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Keith says guys pay money to watch girls wrestle, so they were  <br/>
wondering whether it was a sex show or prostitution.  Oh, see?  I  <br/>
didn&#39;t even think about that.<br/>
<br/>
One more story for now...  She said she was the last one up the stairs  <br/>
(the pudding pool was in the basement) and they had told all the girls  <br/>
to sit on the couch.  Most had showered, but the line for the shower  <br/>
had been long, so Holly was still in the wading pool of pudding.    <br/>
When she got up there, the resident host was in handcuffs, but once  <br/>
they&#39;d figured out the small extent of the problem, they took them  <br/>
off.  But she said she asked if she could sit on the floor instead  <br/>
because she had pudding on her.    They said sure.<br/>
<br/>
When she told me that last night, I told her that was really nice of  <br/>
her, and she said she wouldn&#39;t sit on anyone&#39;s couch with pudding on  <br/>
her, even if the police told her to.<br/>
<br/>
This is the end of my sordid tale of Holly&#39;s detainment by the  <br/>
police.   She was honest, she was considerate of her host&#39;s furniture,  <br/>
she had had  a jello shot (not at all strong, either, she said) and a  <br/>
couple of drinks of others&#39; mixed drinks.   She was pudding-wrestling,  <br/>
just for fun and not for money.<br/>
<br/>
Because we still need to deal with the juvenile probation people and  <br/>
she probably has to go to court, I don&#39;t want to put on my blog that  <br/>
she&#39;s not being punished or grounded.<br/>
<br/>
When Holly knew I was going to write this she said that was good,  <br/>
because some unschoolers seem to think they&#39;re immune from the  <br/>
possibility of getting into trouble.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I hope this doesn&#39;t keep anyone from wanting to continue with  <br/>
unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-553793258">I just posted on another list that it was/is important for those of us who<br/>
have been unschooling for a while, or are still new to it, to hear stories<br/>
from others about the challenges they have/are facing.  This is a wonderful<br/>
example of that.  It helps me, anyway, to know that unschooling is a<br/>
lifestyle, a way of seeing others, but not a protection from all that<br/>
happens in life.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I think Holly is a wonderful example to young girls (you can tell  her I<br/>
said so).  The stories you have told about her over the years about her<br/>
kindness and honesty have always stuck with me.  I wish I had raised Rohana<br/>
(19) the way you raised Holly, Marty, and Kirby.  Maybe then she would be<br/>
more honest and not as fearful.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Holly called you guys and wasnt afraid of your reaction.  She knew that you<br/>
would be there for HER, not for the police.  Holly trusted you.  That is the<br/>
point of all of this, I think.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-129751189">Thank you for sharing that story Sandra.<br/>
<br/>
There is a difference between Holly being at a party and most teenagers<br/>
being at a party.<br/>
<br/>
Holly was not acting out of a need to rebel, or from feelings of inadequacy<br/>
due to neglect, or from built-up contempt. She was having fun.<br/>
Pudding-wrestling...how fun does that sound?? I may suggest it at my kids&#39;<br/>
next party...<br/>
<br/>
I have three teenagers and one 20 year old (15, 17, 19, 20). I haven&#39;t told<br/>
the stories on here that weren&#39;t so pretty. I really admire your honesty.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have been to parties with alcohol and pot. Three have tried pot.<br/>
They&#39;ve had parties at our house where alcohol showed up. Some of their<br/>
friends smoke cigarettes. One of mine smokes cigarettes on occasion. And we<br/>
have two hookahs here. They are used about twice a month in a quiet social<br/>
setting. Sometimes they aren&#39;t used for months at a time (and I don&#39;t worry<br/>
about sheesha...they get the compressed fruit kind that is tobacco-free, and<br/>
it doesn&#39;t create smoke in the house).<br/>
<br/>
But none of my kids are &quot;into&quot; pot, alcohol, cigarettes or drugs. Those are<br/>
minor items in the array of many more interesting things in life. They talk<br/>
openly about drugs and alcohol. They prefer to be home much of their spare<br/>
time.They seem to be gliding through these &quot;troublesome&quot; years. They are<br/>
authentically kind, listen well to people, open doors for others at the<br/>
grocery store, are openly thankful for things...they are good, good people.<br/>
<br/>
But they have a variety of friends and go to a variety of places, so they<br/>
are as susceptible as the next kid to being arrested, detained or any other<br/>
legal situation. I know this when they are out, and I trust that they will<br/>
do their best in situations, but I could just as easily receive a call from<br/>
the police, not because I think my kids are regular law-breakers, but<br/>
because our society is set up that way.<br/>
<br/>
Is the demon that young adults are engaging in these things in life, or is<br/>
the demon that we make it illegal?<br/>
<br/>
Bravo to you and Holly and your family for being so supportive of each<br/>
other. It was really a beautiful story. And I&#39;m sure it will produce laughs<br/>
later on. Maybe not now, but later. It isn&#39;t something to be ashamed of,<br/>
that&#39;s for sure.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing,<br/>
Jacki<br/>

  This is long, but everyone&#39;s fine. Those with young children or who<br/>
  don&#39;t like long posts can skip it.<br/>

  Holly&#39;s is slightly worse than these.<br/>

  Last night at 2:20 Holly (17) called on the house phone. There&#39;s one<br/>
  by our bed. She sounded like she was afraid and embarrassed, and said<br/>
  that the party had been busted, and she needed us to come and pick her<br/>
  up. The police said she needed at least one parent to come. And she<br/>
  was afraid she might have parked the car where it would have been<br/>

<br/>
  So I woke Keith up and told him. Keith had fallen asleep really early<br/>
  because he had been helping clean a group camping site in Edgewood for<br/>
  several hours Saturday morning and afternoon. Brett had been<br/>
  planning to go to the party when I had gone to bed, but Brett had had<br/>
  a too-long day at work and had come home to discuss that and to play<br/>

  to get her, so I told him what I knew and that Marty was on his way<br/>
  home.<br/>
<br/>
  At that point I thought how cool it was that we were all in such close<br/>
  communication. The day I was in an accident a couple or three weeks<br/>
  ago, before I had left the scene, Keith and Holly and Brett were there<br/>
  with me. Marty was at work, or he probably would&#39;ve been there too.<br/>
<br/>
  We got to the house and she was sitting on the porch, chocolate<br/>
  pudding in her hair and everywhere, drying. There were four<br/>
  policemen, and another one in the house. Holly was the last one<br/>
  there besides the two who lived there. She was wearing a t-shirt and<br/>
  shorts, and was barefooted. I wrapped the flannel sheet around her.<br/>
  Keith did the talking, and not much. Everyone was courteous and<br/>
  somber but not tense. Keith apologized and thanked them, and the one<br/>
  who was in charge of Holly before we got there said they were just<br/>
  doing their jobs, and Keith said &quot;Well, I need to do mine too,&quot; and<br/>
  the guy said he was a parent too, and these things happen. So there<br/>
  was no shaming or defensiveness or anything. She was cited, and I<br/>
  can&#39;t read the details on our copy, but I think it&#39;s possession of<br/>
  alcohol by a minor. Maybe it&#39;s consumption. It has a number I can&#39;t<br/>
  see well enough to look it up.<br/>
<br/>
  Holly asked if she could go inside and go to the bathroom. The<br/>
  officer said &quot;You&#39;re in the custody of your parents now--it&#39;s up to<br/>
  them.&quot; We all looked at each other. It wasn&#39;t my house; I didn&#39;t<br/>
  know the residents. Keith said &quot;Go pee.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  While she was gone we talked a little. There was a big dark smear on<br/>
  the bottom concrete step there by the front door. I said &quot;I assume<br/>
  that&#39;s pudding, and not blood.&quot; One of the cops said, &quot;Yeah. There&#39;s<br/>
  pudding everywhere in there. There&#39;s pudding on me.&quot; Another one<br/>
  said &quot;There&#39;s pudding on my flashlight.&quot; It would&#39;ve been funny,<br/>
  but we were all in straight-face, this isn&#39;t funny mode.<br/>
<br/>
  We&#39;ll be contacted by the juvenile probation department. The<br/>
  policeman used the term &quot;intake,&quot; and I asked what that meant. He<br/>
  said they&#39;ll want to determine whether she needs alcohol abuse<br/>
  treatment, and whether she&#39;s in a safe situation. Okay. I don&#39;t<br/>
  think homeschooling will be an issue, and she&#39;s old enough to drop out<br/>
  or graduate anyway, if she were in high school. She has two part-<br/>
  time jobs, and that will help (if they don&#39;t pull a child labor law<br/>
  trick out of the hat &lt;g&gt;). She hasn&#39;t been in trouble, and that will<br/>
  help. No damage to people or property.<br/>
<br/>
  And the drinking she did was one jello shooter, and tastes of two<br/>
  other people&#39;s drinks. She said she never had a drink of her own.<br/>
  There weren&#39;t any drinking games. There were people there not<br/>
  drinking at all.<br/>
<br/>
  She could have lied, but she didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
  When she came out of the house she was crying--frustration and<br/>
  embarrassment kind of crying. Stress.<br/>
<br/>
  Things seemed to be a smooth as possible under the circumstances.<br/>
  When we were leaving, the police could leave, and the two guys who<br/>
  lived there walked them out too, and said good night and thanks and<br/>
  good bye, and Holly rode back with Keith in the van where the heater<br/>
  had been on, and I followed them back in the car. When we got home<br/>
  she was crying, but I do know she told Keith some of the story on the<br/>
  way home and also talked to the birthday hostess to tell her she was<br/>
  okay.<br/>
<br/>
  We got home and she went into the shower. I took the pudding clothes<br/>
  and put them in the washing machine so I could turn it on right after<br/>
  she turned the shower off. The laundry was her bikini top, the<br/>
  Punisher t-shirt her friend Jared had taken off and put on her so<br/>
  she&#39;d be wearing more than just a bikini top and shorts, another t-<br/>
  shirt someone had offered up for people to wipe jello off of them, and<br/>
  she said she would bring back clean. Her shorts and underwear, and<br/>
  the sheet.<br/>
<br/>
  She was unsettled and lightly agitated. I offered to sleep with her<br/>
  in the library and she gratefully took me up on that. I closed down<br/>
  the house, re-ran the laundry, left notes so Keith and Brett would<br/>
  know where we were if they woke up, and went and fixed up that bed.<br/>
  So I curled up behind her and stroked her hair and her arm and told<br/>
  her I loved her and I was sorry she had cried, and she asked what I<br/>
  was thinking about it all, and how much trouble she might be in. I<br/>
  told her there might be a fine, and she&#39;d probably have unsupervised<br/>
  probation, since nobody was hurt and there wasn&#39;t any malice.<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t know who all might&#39;ve been charged besides Holly and the<br/>
  resident hosts. I&#39;m willing to provide follow-ups on this. If I&#39;m<br/>
  going to be telling how wonderful our lives are, it&#39;s only fair to<br/>
  give some detail on the less than wonderful times.<br/>
<br/>
  Ashlee (now 23) told me last night that when she was 15 she spent the<br/>
  night with a friend, and they got a ride to a party on the other end<br/>
  of town. She grew up 20 miles north of here in Bernalillo, a little<br/>
  farm town two miles long. The girls were walking home from the<br/>
  party, really late, and the police came and took each of them to her<br/>
  own home. Ashlee&#39;s parents grounded her from watching MTV for a year,<br/>
  she said, because they were sure watching MTV had made her wild.<br/>
<br/>
  We&#39;re not grounding Holly from anything. We didn&#39;t congratulate her<br/>
  or make light of it, but she was fully remorseful and is more<br/>
  concerned about how we feel about it, and the inconvenience to us in<br/>
  the middle of the night, than about her own outcome. She&#39;ll be 18 in<br/>
  November, and juvenile offenses like this are wiped off, in New<br/>
  Mexico. Or maybe it will be wiped when she&#39;s 21, or after the<br/>
  probationary period; I don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
  The police seemed to have felt better after they asked Holly whether<br/>
  any of the girls were pudding-wrestling for money. Holly didn&#39;t<br/>
  really understand the question, and I didn&#39;t even hear about it until<br/>
  later, but it makes more sense now, thinking back to when the youngest<br/>
  officer said &quot;It was a party activity,&quot; and I said &quot;Well I guess it&#39;s<br/>
  good it wasn&#39;t just her and one other girl,&quot; and he said &quot;No, they<br/>
  were all doing it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  Keith says guys pay money to watch girls wrestle, so they were<br/>
  wondering whether it was a sex show or prostitution. Oh, see? I<br/>
  didn&#39;t even think about that.<br/>
<br/>
  One more story for now... She said she was the last one up the stairs<br/>
  (the pudding pool was in the basement) and they had told all the girls<br/>
  to sit on the couch. Most had showered, but the line for the shower<br/>
  had been long, so Holly was still in the wading pool of pudding.<br/>
  When she got up there, the resident host was in handcuffs, but once<br/>
  they&#39;d figured out the small extent of the problem, they took them<br/>
  off. But she said she asked if she could sit on the floor instead<br/>
  because she had pudding on her. They said sure.<br/>
<br/>
  When she told me that last night, I told her that was really nice of<br/>
  her, and she said she wouldn&#39;t sit on anyone&#39;s couch with pudding on<br/>
  her, even if the police told her to.<br/>
<br/>
  This is the end of my sordid tale of Holly&#39;s detainment by the<br/>
  police. She was honest, she was considerate of her host&#39;s furniture,<br/>
  she had had a jello shot (not at all strong, either, she said) and a<br/>
  couple of drinks of others&#39; mixed drinks. She was pudding-wrestling,<br/>
  just for fun and not for money.<br/>
<br/>
  Because we still need to deal with the juvenile probation people and<br/>
  she probably has to go to court, I don&#39;t want to put on my blog that<br/>
  she&#39;s not being punished or grounded.<br/>
<br/>
  When Holly knew I was going to write this she said that was good,<br/>
  because some unschoolers seem to think they&#39;re immune from the<br/>
  possibility of getting into trouble.<br/>
<br/>
  I hope this doesn&#39;t keep anyone from wanting to continue with<br/>
  unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1148601040">So I read this whole thing and started crying. It was this paragraph: <br/>
<br/>
&quot;She was unsettled and lightly agitated.  I offered to sleep with her  <br/>
in the library and she gratefully took me up on that.   I closed down  <br/>
the house, re-ran the laundry, left notes so Keith and Brett would  <br/>

<br/>
that started me crying. I can remember going to parties where the police showed up. I can remember running and jumping fences so that minors weren&#39;t present at a party with alcohol or staying and sitting while the police yelled at us. I didn&#39;t drink, so it wasn&#39;t my drinking that would have put the host at risk. My parents weren&#39;t ever called. If they had been called I don&#39;t imagine the response would have been them holding me and stroking my hair and telling me that they loved me. I don&#39;t imagine that it would have been anything but grounding and yelling and shaming. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for sharing this. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-953271487">Thank you so much, to Holly as well, for sharing this.  If I weren&#39;t an<br/>
unschooler already it would be an evidence of how the relationship it<br/>
fosters with our children carries us through the most unexpected moments.<br/>
<br/>
Lanora hasn&#39;t encountered anything like this so far but Jonathan isn&#39;t a<br/>
teen yet.  I was at countless parties which could have gone this way so<br/>
easily.  My heart goes out to Holly, her honesty cost her some hassle but<br/>
not her integrity, hopefully the frustration and embarrassment will be<br/>
replaced by some good chuckles over the situation someday.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-582633840">#1:  I see young adults getting feeling SAFE to turn to <br/>
their parents when they are in trouble.  I *WANT* to<br/>
have that kind of relationship with my children as<br/>
they continue to grow.  Why would this story deter<br/>
me from unschooling?  Quite the opposite and I thank<br/>
you for sharing it.<br/>
<br/>
#2:  I also see that these situations are mild compared<br/>
with the hair-raising sex and drugs stories I am hearing<br/>
from parents of schooled kids... and I mean kids in middle<br/>
school!  I&#39;m sure they don&#39;t feel &quot;mild&quot; when you are talking<br/>
to the police, but still... <br/>
<br/>
...I refer back to point #1.<br/>
<br/>
Again, thank you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1429752102">Mother of a young child here and I&#39;m so grateful to you and Holly for sharing your story.  It is truly touching to hear how close you are and that you are able to be with your kids in the face of trying times.  I only hope that I will have that kind of relationship with my child throughout his life.<br/>
<br/>
For me, this story would never turn me away from unschooling.  If anything, it solidifies our decision.  Its wonderful that you have such unconditional love for your family.  Makes me wish I grew up with you instead of my family of origin!  <br/>

&gt; This is long, but everyone&#39;s fine.   Those with young children or who  <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t like long posts can skip it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My introduction is that each of our children has been in trouble with  <br/>
&gt; the law now.<br/>
&gt; Kirby drove his friend Joey home about four blocks, and he forgot to  <br/>
&gt; turn his headlights on.  We went to court and they let him pay the  <br/>
&gt; fine without talking to the judge.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Marty was on a playground in a public park after hours (parks close at  <br/>
&gt; 10:00 or 10:30)--not drinking, not doing anything but playing on the  <br/>
&gt; slides with three other people, one 21 and the others 18, 19.  He did  <br/>
&gt; two days of community service at the Red Cross office.  (He reminded  <br/>
&gt; me that he also was ticketed for stopping too hard at a stop light.   <br/>
&gt; He stopped, but not gracefully, and we went to court and he paid a  <br/>
&gt; fine and went to a driving class.  No alcohol nor any other such thing  <br/>
&gt; involved.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Holly&#39;s is slightly worse than these.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Last night at 2:20 Holly (17) called on the house phone.  There&#39;s one  <br/>
&gt; by our bed.  She sounded like she was afraid and embarrassed, and said  <br/>
&gt; that the party had been busted, and she needed us to come and pick her  <br/>
&gt; up.  The police said she needed at least one parent to come.  And she  <br/>
&gt; was afraid she might have parked the car where it would have been  <br/>
&gt; towed.  She couldn&#39;t see it from where she was.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So I woke Keith up and told him.  Keith had fallen asleep really early  <br/>
&gt; because he had been helping clean a group camping site in Edgewood for  <br/>
&gt; several hours Saturday morning and afternoon.   Brett had been  <br/>
&gt; planning to go to the party when I had gone to bed, but Brett had had  <br/>
&gt; a too-long day at work and had come home to discuss that and to play  <br/>
&gt; World of Warcraft.  (Brett is Holly&#39;s boyfriend, who&#39;s staying with  <br/>
&gt; us, for those new to the saga.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Brett&#39;s car was in the driveway and the house was dark, so we went out  <br/>
&gt; quietly.  I thought maybe he could be spared the worry, and it&#39;s  <br/>
&gt; possible that Holly wouldn&#39;t have wanted him there, but just us.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I went back to get a big flannel sheet, because besides  &quot;bust&quot; Holly  <br/>
&gt; had also mentioned &quot;wrestling in pudding.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I knew where she was, because it was a house she&#39;d never been to  <br/>
&gt; before, hosting a party for a couple she&#39;s known separately a long  <br/>
&gt; time, and together.  One was having a birthday; the other had  <br/>
&gt; sufficiently recovered from a broken neck in a car accident (he&#39;s  <br/>
&gt; mobile), to share a party.  She had been scheduled to go to his  <br/>
&gt; birthday party a couple of months ago when he had the accident.    <br/>
&gt; Brett and I had helped (by phone) figure out exactly where the house  <br/>
&gt; was and how she could best get there from where she was after work.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For those who know Albuquerque, we&#39;re near the mountains (Juan Tabo  <br/>
&gt; and Candelaria) and she was down past the university, across from  <br/>
&gt; Roosevelt Park.  It&#39;s eight miles or ten, maybe.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As we were driving, we discussed what the best tack to take would be.   <br/>
&gt; We shouldn&#39;t be too cheery about it.  We weren&#39;t going to act harsher  <br/>
&gt; than we felt.  I was thinking at that time it might be a marijuana  <br/>
&gt; situation.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A mile from the house Marty called.  He had been invited to the party,  <br/>
&gt; but had opted to go to a couple of parties his girlfriend had been  <br/>
&gt; invited to instead.   They were done there, and he had called to see  <br/>
&gt; if the birthday/recovery party was still on, and the birthday-person  <br/>
&gt; answered her cell from her car, where she was driving drunks home.    <br/>
&gt; She told Marty what she knew.  So I was relieved it was alcohol and  <br/>
&gt; pudding, rather than drugs.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Holly had been the second youngest person at the party.   The sixteen  <br/>
&gt; year old girl was asked &quot;were you drinking?&quot; and she said &quot;no,&quot; so  <br/>
&gt; they said &quot;Go home.&quot;    Everyone over 21 who could prove it was told  <br/>
&gt; to go home.  (Holly&#39;s unsure if any of them got citations).  Holly had  <br/>
&gt; said yes, about drinking, so they told her to call her parents.  And  <br/>
&gt; Holly didn&#39;t know the other girl, nor several of the people at the  <br/>
&gt; party.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The birthday hostess (not resident) had wanted to stay with Holly but  <br/>
&gt; the police told her she needed to leave and help get the intoxicated  <br/>
&gt; friends safely home.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Marty (20, her brother) had been willing to go and get Holly, but I  <br/>
&gt; told him it needed to be a parent and we were already on the way.  So  <br/>
&gt; he said he and Ashlee-his-girlfriend would go on to our house.  I told  <br/>
&gt; him Brett didn&#39;t know yet, so maybe not to bother him with it but let  <br/>
&gt; Holly tell him, unless he asked directly.  I thought he was asleep.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just a minute or so later, Brett  (25, her boyfriend) called.  It was  <br/>
&gt; 2:40 or so by then, and he had been just about to go to sleep but  <br/>
&gt; called Holly to see if she was okay and when she was coming back.    <br/>
&gt; The police let her answer the phone.  She told him we were on our way  <br/>
&gt; to get her, so I told him what I knew and that Marty was on his way  <br/>
&gt; home.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At that point I thought how cool it was that we were all in such close  <br/>
&gt; communication.  The day I was in an accident a couple or three weeks  <br/>
&gt; ago, before I had left the scene, Keith and Holly and Brett were there  <br/>
&gt; with me.    Marty was at work, or he probably would&#39;ve been there too.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We got to the house and she was sitting on the porch, chocolate  <br/>
&gt; pudding in her hair and everywhere, drying.  There were four  <br/>
&gt; policemen, and another one in the house.   Holly was the last one  <br/>
&gt; there besides the two who lived there. She was wearing a t-shirt and  <br/>
&gt; shorts, and was barefooted.  I wrapped the flannel sheet around her.   <br/>
&gt; Keith did the talking, and not much.  Everyone was courteous and  <br/>
&gt; somber but not tense.  Keith apologized and thanked them, and the one  <br/>
&gt; who was in charge of Holly before we got there  said they were just  <br/>
&gt; doing their jobs, and Keith said &quot;Well, I need to do mine too,&quot; and  <br/>
&gt; the guy said he was a parent too, and these things happen.   So there  <br/>
&gt; was no shaming or defensiveness or anything.   She was cited, and I  <br/>
&gt; can&#39;t read the details on our copy, but I think it&#39;s possession of  <br/>
&gt; alcohol by a minor.  Maybe it&#39;s consumption. It has a number I can&#39;t  <br/>
&gt; see well enough to look it up.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Holly asked if she could go inside and go to the bathroom.  The  <br/>
&gt; officer said &quot;You&#39;re in the custody of your parents now--it&#39;s up to  <br/>
&gt; them.&quot;  We all looked at each other.  It wasn&#39;t my house; I didn&#39;t  <br/>
&gt; know the residents.  Keith said &quot;Go pee.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; While she was gone we talked a little.  There was a big dark smear on  <br/>
&gt; the bottom concrete step there by the front door.  I said &quot;I assume  <br/>
&gt; that&#39;s pudding, and not blood.&quot;  One of the cops said, &quot;Yeah.  There&#39;s  <br/>
&gt; pudding everywhere in there.    There&#39;s pudding on me.&quot;  Another one  <br/>
&gt; said &quot;There&#39;s pudding on my flashlight.&quot;    It would&#39;ve been funny,  <br/>
&gt; but we were all in straight-face, this isn&#39;t funny mode.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We&#39;ll be contacted by the juvenile probation department.  The  <br/>
&gt; policeman used the term &quot;intake,&quot; and I asked what that meant.  He  <br/>
&gt; said they&#39;ll want to determine whether she needs alcohol abuse  <br/>
&gt; treatment, and whether she&#39;s in a safe situation.  Okay.    I don&#39;t  <br/>
&gt; think homeschooling will be an issue, and she&#39;s old enough to drop out  <br/>
&gt; or graduate anyway, if she were in high school.   She has two part- <br/>
&gt; time jobs, and that will help (if they don&#39;t pull a child labor law  <br/>
&gt; trick out of the hat &lt;g&gt;).   She hasn&#39;t been in trouble, and that will  <br/>
&gt; help.  No damage to people or property.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And the drinking she did was one jello shooter, and tastes of two  <br/>
&gt; other people&#39;s drinks.  She said she never had a drink of her own.  <br/>
&gt; There weren&#39;t any drinking games.  There were people there not  <br/>
&gt; drinking at all.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She could have lied, but she didn&#39;t.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When she came out of the house she was crying--frustration and  <br/>
&gt; embarrassment kind of crying.  Stress.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Things seemed to be a smooth as possible under the circumstances.    <br/>
&gt; When we were leaving, the police could leave, and the two guys who  <br/>
&gt; lived there walked them out too, and said good night and thanks and  <br/>
&gt; good bye, and Holly rode back with Keith in the van where the heater  <br/>
&gt; had been on, and I followed them back in the car.  When we got home  <br/>
&gt; she was crying, but I do know she told Keith some of the story on the  <br/>
&gt; way home and also talked to the birthday hostess to tell her she was  <br/>
&gt; okay.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We got home and she went into the shower.  I took the pudding clothes  <br/>
&gt; and put them in the washing machine so I could turn it on right after  <br/>
&gt; she turned the shower off.  The laundry was her bikini top, the  <br/>
&gt; Punisher t-shirt her friend Jared had taken off and put on her so  <br/>
&gt; she&#39;d be wearing more than just a bikini top and shorts, another t- <br/>
&gt; shirt someone had offered up for people to wipe jello off of them, and  <br/>
&gt; she said she would bring back clean.   Her shorts and underwear, and  <br/>
&gt; the sheet.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She was unsettled and lightly agitated.  I offered to sleep with her  <br/>
&gt; in the library and she gratefully took me up on that.   I closed down  <br/>
&gt; the house, re-ran the laundry, left notes so Keith and Brett would  <br/>
&gt; know where we were if they woke up, and went and fixed up that bed.   <br/>
&gt; So I curled up behind her and stroked her hair and her arm and told  <br/>
&gt; her I loved her and I was sorry she had cried, and she asked what I  <br/>
&gt; was thinking about it all, and how much trouble she might be in.    I  <br/>
&gt; told her there might be a fine, and she&#39;d probably have unsupervised  <br/>
&gt; probation, since nobody was hurt and there wasn&#39;t any malice.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know who all might&#39;ve been charged besides Holly and the  <br/>
&gt; resident hosts.  I&#39;m willing to provide follow-ups on this.  If I&#39;m  <br/>
&gt; going to be telling how wonderful our lives are, it&#39;s only fair to  <br/>
&gt; give some detail on the less than wonderful times.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ashlee (now 23) told me last night that when she was 15 she spent the  <br/>
&gt; night with a friend, and they got a ride to a party on the other end  <br/>
&gt; of town.  She grew up 20 miles north of here in Bernalillo, a little  <br/>
&gt; farm town two miles long.     The girls were walking home from the  <br/>
&gt; party, really late, and the police came and took each of them to her  <br/>
&gt; own home.  Ashlee&#39;s parents grounded her from watching MTV for a year,  <br/>
&gt; she said, because they were sure watching MTV had made her wild.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We&#39;re not grounding Holly from anything.   We didn&#39;t congratulate her  <br/>
&gt; or make light of it, but she was fully remorseful and is more  <br/>
&gt; concerned about how we feel about it, and the inconvenience to us in  <br/>
&gt; the middle of the night,  than about her own outcome.  She&#39;ll be 18 in  <br/>
&gt; November, and juvenile offenses like this are wiped off, in New  <br/>
&gt; Mexico.  Or maybe it will be wiped when she&#39;s 21, or after the  <br/>
&gt; probationary period; I don&#39;t know.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The police seemed to have felt better after they asked Holly whether  <br/>
&gt; any of the girls were pudding-wrestling for money.    Holly didn&#39;t  <br/>
&gt; really understand the question, and I didn&#39;t even hear about it until  <br/>
&gt; later, but it makes more sense now, thinking back to when the youngest  <br/>
&gt; officer said &quot;It was a party activity,&quot; and I said &quot;Well I guess it&#39;s  <br/>
&gt; good it wasn&#39;t just her and one other girl,&quot; and he said &quot;No, they  <br/>
&gt; were all doing it.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Keith says guys pay money to watch girls wrestle, so they were  <br/>
&gt; wondering whether it was a sex show or prostitution.  Oh, see?  I  <br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t even think about that.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One more story for now...  She said she was the last one up the stairs  <br/>
&gt; (the pudding pool was in the basement) and they had told all the girls  <br/>
&gt; to sit on the couch.  Most had showered, but the line for the shower  <br/>
&gt; had been long, so Holly was still in the wading pool of pudding.    <br/>
&gt; When she got up there, the resident host was in handcuffs, but once  <br/>
&gt; they&#39;d figured out the small extent of the problem, they took them  <br/>
&gt; off.  But she said she asked if she could sit on the floor instead  <br/>
&gt; because she had pudding on her.    They said sure.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When she told me that last night, I told her that was really nice of  <br/>
&gt; her, and she said she wouldn&#39;t sit on anyone&#39;s couch with pudding on  <br/>
&gt; her, even if the police told her to.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is the end of my sordid tale of Holly&#39;s detainment by the  <br/>
&gt; police.   She was honest, she was considerate of her host&#39;s furniture,  <br/>
&gt; she had had  a jello shot (not at all strong, either, she said) and a  <br/>
&gt; couple of drinks of others&#39; mixed drinks.   She was pudding-wrestling,  <br/>
&gt; just for fun and not for money.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Because we still need to deal with the juvenile probation people and  <br/>
&gt; she probably has to go to court, I don&#39;t want to put on my blog that  <br/>
&gt; she&#39;s not being punished or grounded.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When Holly knew I was going to write this she said that was good,  <br/>
&gt; because some unschoolers seem to think they&#39;re immune from the  <br/>
&gt; possibility of getting into trouble.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I hope this doesn&#39;t keep anyone from wanting to continue with  <br/>
&gt; unschooling.<br/>

Well no.  What it does is give a clear picture of how important it is <br/>
to cultivate and keep strong relationships going with your children, so <br/>
that when stuff like this happens there&#39;s no fear of what one&#39;s kids <br/>
may be doing wrong when you&#39;re not looking... to the extent that you&#39;d <br/>
be concerned you&#39;re being lied to or other dishonest is going on that <br/>
you can&#39;t help your child with.  I&#39;d hate to be faced with a situation <br/>
like this *not* knowing one way or the other and feeling helpless.  <br/>
It&#39;s a plus for growing as much trust as you can while you can.  And <br/>
it&#39;s a bit of a kick in the rear to get serious about it and not wait <br/>
around.  Because trust is part of the active effort of being with Karl, <br/>
and for me, it doesn&#39;t grow itself.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I tell my kids that police officers are supposed to be the keepers of<br/>
peace.  That is their job.  It&#39;s not always how it plays out, but in<br/>
light of seeing people for the best that they can be, I&#39;d still like my<br/>
kids to know that.   That is what a police officer is supposed to do.<br/>
<br/>
On many occasions, Chamille wants to walk to the local convenience store<br/>
after curfew, with friends.  It&#39;s about 2 blocks away.  I&#39;ve told them<br/>
always, to be quiet and keep a low profile, and if confronted, to tell<br/>
the truth, that they are walking to the 7-11 to get some snacks and<br/>
going straight home and that they have permission to do so and that they<br/>
live just 2 blocks away.  Curfew where were we live is really early and<br/>
police are very strict about it.  I personally think it&#39;s a little<br/>
extreme, especially on weekends.  I&#39;ve never had a problem with it and I<br/>
really think that if they are being kind and truthful, things will go<br/>
better for them.<br/>
<br/>
Chamille is really honest about things.  I&#39;ve known her to lie once, and<br/>
it was because she was backed into a corner, verbally, by another adult<br/>
who was yelling at her over the phone.  We talked about how to handle<br/>
that sort of situation in the future, but that was her response at the<br/>
time because she was upset and afraid.  She knows that she can hang up<br/>
on someone who is yelling at her over the phone, and she also knows that<br/>
if she gets the chance, she can retract the lie she told and apologize<br/>
for having lied.<br/>
<br/>
I really like Chamille&#39;s honesty.  She has friends that aren&#39;t always<br/>
honest, and it&#39;s hard to know where you stand in those circumstances.  I<br/>
don&#39;t like being made into a patsy believing someone who&#39;s lied to me. <br/>
Sometimes I&#39;ve told Chamille that a don&#39;t ask, don&#39;t tell policy is<br/>
better than outright lying.  I don&#39;t like knowing that a kid is sneaking<br/>
over to our house against their parent&#39;s wishes.  I&#39;d rather not be in<br/>
the know on that.  If a kid wants to be dishonest to their own parents,<br/>
that&#39;s one thing, by telling me, they are making me responsible for it. <br/>
Sometimes Chamille tells me anyway simply because she&#39;s very honest and<br/>
we discuss the pros and cons of knowing and not knowing about someone<br/>
else&#39;s misdeeds and being party to it.</div>

is a<br/>
matter of integrity.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think it is.<br/>
There was a murder trial here recently and a friend of mine was the  <br/>
prosecutor.   His witnesses were lying.  What a waste of time and  <br/>
energy and money.<br/>
<br/>
-=-If you can avoid a huge amount of hassle and expense by not telling  <br/>

would<br/>
I tell you the truth when I know what you are going to do to me if I do?<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
Because my kids grew up with good parents, I guess, they haven&#39;t  <br/>
learned that kind of judgment of when and why they might want to lie.   <br/>
I&#39;m glad.<br/>
<br/>
The crime last night was really disturbing the peace.  Neighbors  <br/>
called about noise.  The noise was undeniable, but I don&#39;t think  <br/>
anyone was charged with disturbing the peace, because there was alcohol.<br/>
<br/>
-=-In my experience, the cops are not anyone&#39;s friend. They don&#39;t have  <br/>
your<br/>
best interest at heart. -=-<br/>
<br/>
The cops seemed like decent guys from what I saw.  I don&#39;t want the  <br/>
police to have my neighbors&#39; comfort in mind if I call them about  <br/>
firing that BB gun into my yard sometime.   I want them to have MY  <br/>
comfort in mind.   And last night, the neighbors of the house where  <br/>
the party was were well served.<br/>
<br/>
The major concern the police had last night was described to me and  <br/>
Keith while Holly was in the bathroom.  There were underage girls,  <br/>
lots of mid-twenties men, and liquor.  That was no time to defend  <br/>
Holly&#39;s abilities and judgment.  She was covered in chocolate  <br/>
pudding.   Those of the guys there I know are gaming geeks and comic  <br/>
book fans.  They were friends of her two big brothers, and of her  <br/>
boyfriend.  It was not  the college jocks and the high school  <br/>
cheerleaders.   No sense talking to the cops about that, though.   <br/>
Their description was accurate, and it&#39;s not a good situation for  <br/>
needy girls without strong voices who might not be able to call their  <br/>
dads at 3:00 in the morning for a rescue.<br/>
<br/>
-=-It isn&#39;t personal relationship that would have been damaged by  <br/>
lying.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Integrity isn&#39;t about relationships with other people so much as it&#39;s  <br/>
being whole and true and centered.   To save a child&#39;s life, I would  <br/>
lie to a bad guy.<br/>
<br/>
With my kids, since they were little we&#39;ve talked about living in such  <br/>
a way that you are willing to admit what you&#39;ve done.  Integrity  <br/>
starts before that point when the police are asking what happened.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1388991978">For me this is an example of rules vs. principles and the principle is<br/>
justice.<br/>
<br/>
If Holly had damaged someone&#39;s property or hurt someone and could have<br/>
gotten away with it but is honest and tells the truth about what happened<br/>
that would also be a hassle and cost money, but it&#39;s a just action. It&#39;s a<br/>
smart, good, ethical thing to do. That&#39;s justice.<br/>
<br/>
Having a jello shot didn&#39;t disturb the peace and justice doesn&#39;t require<br/>
that she take some ridiculous class, pay a fine and have something on her<br/>
record until she reaches adulthood. I don&#39;t see any justice in what<br/>
happened.<br/>
<br/>
And if the counter-argument is &quot;she broke the law&quot; that comes down to rules<br/>
vs. principles. It&#39;s an issue of integrity when it relates to justice and<br/>
fairness.<br/>
<br/>
If Holly had just said &quot;Nope, I wasn&#39;t drinking.&quot; She would have been sent<br/>
home. No harm would have come to anybody. There&#39;s no injustice in that. She<br/>
would still be whole, true and centered.<br/>
<br/>
I am not saying Holly did anything wrong in telling the truth, but I don&#39;t<br/>
think there would have been anything wrong with her choosing to lie in that<br/>
situation. I do think the girl who said she hadn&#39;t been drinking is in a<br/>
better position right now than Holly.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1148392581">This actually touched me very deeply. We are still learning and making mistakes along the way. However, it shows that life is a bed of roses thorns and all. We all make mistakes and should take responsibility for them but having close, loving relationships to help support us even then is just as important. It is something my family is seeing more and more. There was no reason for Holly to lie, she had her family to support her and love her and just as important no one stood and judged her actions. <br/>
<br/>
As for the police officers, I have run into good, bad, and indifferent. It sounds like the good ones showed up. I can understand their concerns having once been one of those wild ones at wild parties where we actually were on a first name basis with our local PD very quickly. Having your own guiding principles does not always mean they will supersede laws that are in effect. A mistake was made and a law was broken, one of the reasons records are sealed at 18 for most incidents like this is because young people do make mistakes. Once they are of the majority they have, in most cases, learned and moved on, so they get a fresh start in the next stage of life&#39;s journey. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-429305737">{{{H ugs}}} to you and Holly, Sandra. My older (public-schooled) kids have each been involved in things like this at one time or another. They are now 22, 18, and 16 but they&#39;ve always told me the truth, I think because our relationship was always open and trusting, and because I was never the type to ground or punish. (I have one friend who still has trouble wrapping her mind around the fact that my boys managed to make it to adulthood without ever having  been grounded.) <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Last year, my daughter, who was 15 at the time, got caught shoplifting at the mall with a friend. They led her, handcuffed, in tears, through the public part of the mall, and she eventually had to do community service and write a letter of apology (although none of it is on her record). On the way home, we had a serious talk, in which I shared that I had been caught shop lifting at the same age. I was angry, and she knew it, but I wanted to let her know that I understood, and that I love her no matter what. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t ground her or punish her in any way, but s he recently told me that the worst moment of her life so far was when I came to pick her up at the police station and she saw the look on my face. I don&#39;t remember what kind of expression I was wearing (anger? disappointment?) , but she said she had never seen it before, and never wants to see it again. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think most people who are drawn to unschooling are probably the kind of parents who already have open, trusting relationships with their kids, and that will help ease those inevitable bumps in the road during the teen years (and the bumps are inevitable, no matter how the kids are schooled.) I know how you&#39;re feeling right now, but I bet everything will turn out just fine. <br/>

This is long, but everyone&#39;s fine. Those with young children or who <br/>
don&#39;t like long posts can skip it. <br/>
<br/>
My introduction is that each of our children has been in trouble with <br/>
the law now. <br/>
Kirby drove his friend Joey home about four blocks, and he forgot to <br/>
turn his headlights on. We went to court and they let him pay the <br/>
fine without talking to the judge. <br/>
<br/>
Marty was on a playground in a public park after hours (parks close at <br/>
10:00 or 10:30)--not drinking, not doing anything but playing on the <br/>
slides with three other people, one 21 and the others 18, 19. He did <br/>
two days of community service at the Red Cross office. (He reminded <br/>
me that he also was ticketed for stopping too hard at a stop light. <br/>
He stopped, but not gracefully, and we went to court and he paid a <br/>
fine and went to a driving class. No alcohol nor any other such thing <br/>
involved.) <br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s is slightly worse than these. <br/>
<br/>
Last night at 2:20 Holly (17) called on the house phone. There&#39;s one <br/>
by our bed. She sounded like she was afraid and embarrassed, and said <br/>
that the party had been busted, and she needed us to come and pick her <br/>
up. The police said she needed at least one parent to come. And she <br/>
was afraid she might have parked the car where it would have been <br/>
towed. She couldn&#39;t see it from where she was. <br/>
<br/>
So I woke Keith up and told him. Keith had fallen asleep really early <br/>
because he had been helping clean a group camping site in Edgewood for <br/>
several hours Saturday morning and afternoon. Brett had been <br/>
planning to go to the party when I had gone to bed, but Brett had had <br/>
a too-long day at work and had come home to discuss that and to play <br/>
World of Warcraft. (Brett is Holly&#39;s boyfriend, who&#39;s staying with <br/>
us, for those new to the saga.) <br/>
<br/>
Brett&#39;s car was in the driveway and the house was dark, so we went out <br/>
quietly. I thought maybe he could be spared the worry, and it&#39;s <br/>
possible that Holly wouldn&#39;t have wanted him there, but just us. <br/>
<br/>
I went back to get a big flannel sheet, because besides &quot;bust&quot; Holly <br/>
had also mentioned &quot;wrestling in pudding.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I knew where she was, because it was a house she&#39;d never been to <br/>
before, hosting a party for a couple she&#39;s known separately a long <br/>
time, and together. One was having a birthday; the other had <br/>
sufficiently recovered from a broken neck in a car accident (he&#39;s <br/>
mobile), to share a party. She had been scheduled to go to his <br/>
birthday party a couple of months ago when he had the accident. <br/>
Brett and I had helped (by phone) figure out exactly where the house <br/>
was and how she could best get there from where she was after work. <br/>
<br/>
For those who know Albuquerque, we&#39;re near the mountains (Juan Tabo <br/>
and Candelaria) and she was down past the university, across from <br/>
Roosevelt Park. It&#39;s eight miles or ten, maybe. <br/>
<br/>
As we were driving, we discussed what the best tack to take would be. <br/>
We shouldn&#39;t be too cheery about it. We weren&#39;t going to act harsher <br/>
than we felt. I was thinking at that time it might be a marijuana <br/>
situation. <br/>
<br/>
A mile from the house Marty called. He had been invited to the party, <br/>
but had opted to go to a couple of parties his girlfriend had been <br/>
invited to instead. They were done there, and he had called to see <br/>
if the birthday/recovery party was still on, and the birthday-person <br/>
answered her cell from her car, where she was driving drunks home. <br/>
She told Marty what she knew. So I was relieved it was alcohol and <br/>
pudding, rather than drugs. <br/>
<br/>
Holly had been the second youngest person at the party. The sixteen <br/>
year old girl was asked &quot;were you drinking?&quot; and she said &quot;no,&quot; so <br/>
they said &quot;Go home.&quot; Everyone over 21 who could prove it was told <br/>
to go home. (Holly&#39;s unsure if any of them got citations). Holly had <br/>
said yes, about drinking, so they told her to call her parents. And <br/>
Holly didn&#39;t know the other girl, nor several of the people at the <br/>
party. <br/>
<br/>
The birthday hostess (not resident) had wanted to stay with Holly but <br/>
the police told her she needed to leave and help get the intoxicated <br/>
friends safely home. <br/>
<br/>
Marty (20, her brother) had been willing to go and get Holly, but I <br/>
told him it needed to be a parent and we were already on the way. So <br/>
he said he and Ashlee-his-girlfriend would go on to our house. I told <br/>
him Brett didn&#39;t know yet, so maybe not to bother him with it but let <br/>
Holly tell him, unless he asked directly. I thought he was asleep. <br/>
<br/>
Just a minute or so later, Brett (25, her boyfriend) called. It was <br/>
2:40 or so by then, and he had been just about to go to sleep but <br/>
called Holly to see if she was okay and when she was coming back. <br/>
The police let her answer the phone. She told him we were on our way <br/>
to get her, so I told him what I knew and that Marty was on his way <br/>
home. <br/>
<br/>
At that point I thought how cool it was that we were all in such close <br/>
communication. The day I was in an accident a couple or three weeks <br/>
ago, before I had left the scene, Keith and Holly and Brett were there <br/>
with me. Marty was at work, or he probably would&#39;ve been there too. <br/>
<br/>
We got to the house and she was sitting on the porch, chocolate <br/>
pudding in her hair and everywhere, drying. There were four <br/>
policemen, and another one in the house. Holly was the last one <br/>
there besides the two who lived there. She was wearing a t-shirt and <br/>
shorts, and was barefooted. I wrapped the flannel sheet around her. <br/>
Keith did the talking, and not much. Everyone was courteous and <br/>
somber but not tense. Keith apologized and thanked them, and the one <br/>
who was in charge of Holly before we got there said they were just <br/>
doing their jobs, and Keith said &quot;Well, I need to do mine too,&quot; and <br/>
the guy said he was a parent too, and these things happen. So there <br/>
was no shaming or defensiveness or anything. She was cited, and I <br/>
can&#39;t read the details on our copy, but I think it&#39;s possession of <br/>
alcohol by a minor. Maybe it&#39;s consumption. It has a number I can&#39;t <br/>
see well enough to look it up. <br/>
<br/>
Holly asked if she could go inside and go to the bathroom. The <br/>
officer said &quot;You&#39;re in the custody of your parents now--it&#39;s up to <br/>
them.&quot; We all looked at each other. It wasn&#39;t my house; I didn&#39;t <br/>
know the residents. Keith said &quot;Go pee.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
While she was gone we talked a little. There was a big dark smear on <br/>
the bottom concrete step there by the front door. I said &quot;I assume <br/>
that&#39;s pudding, and not blood.&quot; One of the cops said, &quot;Yeah. There&#39;s <br/>
pudding everywhere in there. There&#39;s pudding on me.&quot; Another one <br/>
said &quot;There&#39;s pudding on my flashlight.&quot; It would&#39;ve been funny, <br/>
but we were all in straight-face, this isn&#39;t funny mode. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll be contacted by the juvenile probation department. The <br/>
policeman used the term &quot;intake,&quot; and I asked what that meant. He <br/>
said they&#39;ll want to determine whether she needs alcohol abuse <br/>
treatment, and whether she&#39;s in a safe situation. Okay. I don&#39;t <br/>
think homeschooling will be an issue, and she&#39;s old enough to drop out <br/>
or graduate anyway, if she were in high school. She has two part- <br/>
time jobs, and that will help (if they don&#39;t pull a child labor law <br/>
trick out of the hat &lt;g&gt;). She hasn&#39;t been in trouble, and that will <br/>
help. No damage to people or property. <br/>
<br/>
And the drinking she did was one jello shooter, and tastes of two <br/>
other people&#39;s drinks. She said she never had a drink of her own. <br/>
There weren&#39;t any drinking games. There were people there not <br/>
drinking at all. <br/>
<br/>
She could have lied, but she didn&#39;t. <br/>
<br/>
When she came out of the house she was crying--frustration and <br/>
embarrassment kind of crying. Stress. <br/>
<br/>
Things seemed to be a smooth as possible under the circumstances. <br/>
When we were leaving, the police could leave, and the two guys who <br/>
lived there walked them out too, and said good night and thanks and <br/>
good bye, and Holly rode back with Keith in the van where the heater <br/>
had been on, and I followed them back in the car. When we got home <br/>
she was crying, but I do know she told Keith some of the story on the <br/>
way home and also talked to the birthday hostess to tell her she was <br/>
okay. <br/>
<br/>
We got home and she went into the shower. I took the pudding clothes <br/>
and put them in the washing machine so I could turn it on right after <br/>
she turned the shower off. The laundry was her bikini top, the <br/>
Punisher t-shirt her friend Jared had taken off and put on her so <br/>
she&#39;d be wearing more than just a bikini top and shorts, another t- <br/>
shirt someone had offered up for people to wipe jello off of them, and <br/>
she said she would bring back clean. Her shorts and underwear, and <br/>
the sheet. <br/>
<br/>
She was unsettled and lightly agitated. I offered to sleep with her <br/>
in the library and she gratefully took me up on that. I closed down <br/>
the house, re-ran the laundry, left notes so Keith and Brett would <br/>
know where we were if they woke up, and went and fixed up that bed. <br/>
So I curled up behind her and stroked her hair and her arm and told <br/>
her I loved her and I was sorry she had cried, and she asked what I <br/>
was thinking about it all, and how much trouble she might be in. I <br/>
told her there might be a fine, and she&#39;d probably have unsupervised <br/>
probation, since nobody was hurt and there wasn&#39;t any malice. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know who all might&#39;ve been charged besides Holly and the <br/>
resident hosts. I&#39;m willing to provide follow-ups on this. If I&#39;m <br/>
going to be telling how wonderful our lives are, it&#39;s only fair to <br/>
give some detail on the less than wonderful times. <br/>
<br/>
Ashlee (now 23) told me last night that when she was 15 she spent the <br/>
night with a friend, and they got a ride to a party on the other end <br/>
of town. She grew up 20 miles north of here in Bernalillo, a little <br/>
farm town two miles long. The girls were walking home from the <br/>
party, really late, and the police came and took each of them to her <br/>
own home. Ashlee&#39;s parents grounded her from watching MTV for a year, <br/>
she said, because they were sure watching MTV had made her wild. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re not grounding Holly from anything. We didn&#39;t congratulate her <br/>
or make light of it, but she was fully remorseful and is more <br/>
concerned about how we feel about it, and the inconvenience to us in <br/>
the middle of the night, than about her own outcome. She&#39;ll be 18 in <br/>
November, and juvenile offenses like this are wiped off, in New <br/>
Mexico. Or maybe it will be wiped when she&#39;s 21, or after the <br/>
probationary period; I don&#39;t know. <br/>
<br/>
The police seemed to have felt better after they asked Holly whether <br/>
any of the girls were pudding-wrestling for money. Holly didn&#39;t <br/>
really understand the question, and I didn&#39;t even hear about it until <br/>
later, but it makes more sense now, thinking back to when the youngest <br/>
officer said &quot;It was a party activity,&quot; and I said &quot;Well I guess it&#39;s <br/>
good it wasn&#39;t just her and one other girl,&quot; and he said &quot;No, they <br/>
were all doing it.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Keith says guys pay money to watch girls wrestle, so they were <br/>
wondering whether it was a sex show or prostitution. Oh, see? I <br/>
didn&#39;t even think about that. <br/>
<br/>
One more story for now... She said she was the last one up the stairs <br/>

<br/>
A better position for what?  I wouldn&#39;t want to go in knee jerk mode <br/>
just because a law officer is there asking questions.  I&#39;ve been <br/>
arrested once in the early 90s.  Forgotten unpaid ticket for a broken <br/>
taillight that then went into suspended license status after I moved <br/>
when the notices didn&#39;t follow me because I don&#39;t forward mail.  <br/>
Forty-five minutes in jail, $100 bail, court, class, fine.  It was ok.  <br/>
I&#39;m more careful about my car upkeep.  It&#39;s probably still on my <br/>
records.  Whenever I&#39;ve put in for work, I just list it if the <br/>
application asks for the info.  People have hired me, even a university <br/>
(executive secretarial position in the art dept).<br/>
<br/>
It could have been a huge ordeal for Holly.  Guess that&#39;s not the <br/>
location for having a loud party again.<br/>

have helped as a credible testimony, that&#39;d be a yucky consequence.  <br/>
Particularly bad would be if a lie was based on someone else lying to <br/>
you, which might turn out to be even worse if it came out.  It would <br/>

<br/>
-=-A better position for what? -=-<br/>
<br/>
Well her mom didn&#39;t need to post a long article about juvenile  <br/>
probation, for one thing.<br/>
And her parents might not even know about it.   (That&#39;s better from  <br/>
one angle, but not from all angles.)<br/>
She won&#39;t need to go to court or pay a fine or be on probation.   (I&#39;m  <br/>
not positive Holly will either, but Holly&#39;s more likely.)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that will give the other girl more confidence than scare, and  <br/>
she might end up being at a party where the guys aren&#39;t as (word;  <br/>
running through the options) courteous.  Safe.   Or maybe it will have  <br/>
put enough caution into her, though, that she will be more careful.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t entirely &quot;careful&quot; that saved other parties in town that  <br/>
night, though.  Maybe their neighbors weren&#39;t home, or sleep with the  <br/>
TV on, or are too afraid themselves to call police on the neighbors.<br/>
<br/>
 From my point of view, I&#39;ve been telling kids for years that after  <br/>
certain hours (probably 1:00 a.m. on a Saturday in a residential area)  <br/>
the noise needs to stay in the house.   If the neighbors can hear you,  <br/>
that&#39;s too loud.<br/>
<br/>
So aside from legalities, the kids at this party violated courtesy,  <br/>
and disturbed other people.<br/>
<br/>
As to learning lessons that last for life, Holly might be in a better  <br/>
position.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-911725116">Maisha, I forwarded your response to Holly.   She checks e-mail every  <br/>
few days.   I told her she could read all this if she ever wants to.   <br/>
I&#39;m thinking of printing it all out and putting it in her souvenir box  <br/>
so she can read it when she&#39;s older even if the archives of this list  <br/>
are long gone.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s Holly&#39;s account of her weekend.  Told the way she tells it, the  <br/>
party was a very small part of a very busy couple of days.<br/>
<br/>
La Cueva is a high school, Stems is the flower shop near us, Trader  <br/>
Joe&#39;s is a grocery store, &quot;Mordor&quot; is a secret place (they&#39;ve offered  <br/>
to tell me where, but I declined) where they go to skateboard and have  <br/>
sneaky adventures, and sometimes hide from a security guard.  Kirtland  <br/>
is the air force base.  Marty (her brother) drove her,  Julie (an  <br/>
unschooler they&#39;ve known since birth; Carol Rice&#39;s youngest) and Bo  <br/>
(who did the art for my unschooling page (trees and random-machine),  <br/>
in his jeep.  Flying Star is a bakery/magazine-stand/sandwich-shop- <br/>
turning-restaurant (chain).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
March 24th and 25th<br/>
It&#39;s Sunday afternoon and it&#39;s been a very, very long weekend already.<br/>
<br/>
Friday<br/>
<br/>
Morning- 9:20 am<br/>
waking up, long shower, general getting ready to go.<br/>
Stems- 11:00 am<br/>
There&#39;s a woman named Diane who&#39;s there to help us out through  <br/>
Mother&#39;s Day, she&#39;s from Long Island and pretty chill. She and Debbie  <br/>
did arrangements and corsages and boots, I wired and taped spray roses  <br/>
and answered the phone and such.<br/>
Home- 3:20 pm<br/>
Hung out, ate, made plans.<br/>
Mike&#39;s house- 5:40 pm<br/>
Chilled with Mike and Zach, they played guitar (Mike fixed his), Zach  <br/>
said he had to go this play at La Cueva, Mike said he didn&#39;t want to,  <br/>
I said I wanted to go to Trader Joe&#39;s.<br/>
Out- 6:30 pm<br/>
Went to Trader Joes, re-met this guy Chris in the parking lot, went to  <br/>
La Cueva, watched the play (The Odd Couple)... Whatnot.<br/>
IHOP- 10:00 pm<br/>
Introduced Kyle to everybody. Ordered crepes and french fries, had a  <br/>
really, really good time. Drove home, blah, blah, blah. Marty drove me  <br/>
and Julie and Bo across town.<br/>
Mordor- 12:20 am<br/>
Got to see and ride Bo&#39;s BOMB new skateboard! Walked around, skated,  <br/>
climbed. Went home around like 2:00 am I guess, went to bed.<br/>
<br/>
Saturday<br/>
<br/>
Morning- 7:30 am<br/>
Giggity got up, my mom made me breakfast and a lunch to-go, and I was  <br/>
off!<br/>
Kirtland Flower Shop- 9:00 am<br/>
I opened and got the computer turned on and everything, no problems,  <br/>
Katie came and actually ended up staying for a long time which I was  <br/>
happy about, when I was there by myself I put 50 of those plastic  <br/>
water things on 50 yellow roses and sold some balloons and a rose  <br/>
bundle. Elizabeth showed up and I left. Stopped by Stems to mark my  <br/>
hours down.<br/>
Home- 2:00 pm (ish?)<br/>
Suppose I did some hanging out and MySpace. Thought about taking a  <br/>
nap, ended up just listening to Amy Steinberg and hopping in the  <br/>
shower. I called work (Zumiez) Angie wants me to come in, and because  <br/>
I expressed my negative opinion on being called in, Mason offered to  <br/>
cover my closing shift, so I would leave when he would have left.  <br/>
(7:30) Quickly ate some macaroni as prep.<br/>
MALL<br/>
Zumiez- 5:05 pm<br/>
I did what I do, son! For the majority of being there we listened to  <br/>
Jake&#39;s iPod; Jake&#39;s got some good stuff on that! Great night though,  <br/>
Angie said it&#39;s cool if Mason closed. When it was getting close to  <br/>
7:30 Angie told me she didn&#39;t want me to go because I was keeping her  <br/>
spirits up of sorts, so I agreed to dance for the rest of the 10  <br/>
minutes of my shift. I think it worked to make her happy. I hung out  <br/>
an extra couple minutes, I was in a really weird, loud, and repetitive  <br/>
mood. You know how it goes.<br/>
Hot Topic- 7:50+ pm<br/>
Went over to Hot Topic and met Fabian (I&#39;m actually gonna have to  <br/>
double check on his name), didn&#39;t end up getting any Jamaican colored  <br/>
anything, but it&#39;s all good. I ran to the escalator and quickly  <br/>
chatted with these kids who&#39;s friend got in trouble earlier and then  <br/>
ran to Shoe Fitters, said &#39;yo wassup&#39;, ran back to Zumiez, said yo,  <br/>
yo, yo and goodbye again, and left.<br/>
Out and About- 8:15 pm<br/>
Headed down to Gold and 8th, called my mom and got stuck in traffic.  <br/>
When I got there, though, Emily was really lost, so I waited in my car  <br/>
and listened to my iPod.<br/>
Flying Star- 9:15 pm<br/>
Emily and I ordered ourselves some Mac and Cheese with some Raspberry  <br/>
Chocolate cake goodness. That was such a good hour of the day. Very  <br/>
enjoyable.<br/>
Back in the Car- 10:10 pm<br/>
Back in traffic, going to a party, trying to get directions. Brett and  <br/>
my mom were very helpful.<br/>
Timmy&#39;s house- 10:35 pm<br/>
================<br/>
Steering away from the step-by-step:<br/>
It was an incredible and fun party. DJ, glow sticks and all. Right  <br/>
around 1:45 or so the police showed up. A lot of people had already  <br/>
left and a lot of people ditched out and a lot of people were sent  <br/>
home and then some people got in trouble. Which I guess equals out to  <br/>
a lot of people, right? Well my parents came to get me and the car.  <br/>
They showed up at like 2:45.<br/>
<br/>
Alright, cool.<br/>
I started writing this twelve hours ago.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-346139354">***I think life is way easier if you have a habit of telling the truth. I<br/>
think that&#39;s true even if there are occasions where lying appears to be<br/>
the &quot;easier&quot; course of action. Unnecessary complications arise from lies.***<br/>
<br/>
I think so too.  I think lying doesn&#39;t work.  Even if a person manages to avoid trouble by lying other people know.  Most people are too polite to call someone a liar, but they know, and it changes relationships.  Dealing with whatever trouble comes is less costly than losing the respect of people you care about and count on. <br/>

If Holly is feeling bad for a few days about this at least she doesn&#39;t have the burden of being dishonest on top of everything else. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry for Holly and I&#39;m glad she has kind parents.  I hope she&#39;s feeling better today.  My brother came home drunk one night.  Mom was horrible to him.  She told him he was a disgrace to humanity.   I&#39;m glad things are better for Holly.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2080940219">I&#39;m reposting for two reasons.  Before, it went in as a response so  <br/>
would be filed under Holly&#39;s adventure of the weekend.<br/>
<br/>
And I can&#39;t get the video to go; just the lufthansa advertisement.   <br/>
But I wanted to comment on the title and what little it did say at the  <br/>
site, which was &quot;A teacher from a Nottingham school has being using  <br/>
darts to help pupils with their sums.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s interesting to see when and why (and how often) people are  <br/>
referred to as &quot;students&quot; or &quot;pupils.&quot;  I suppose it&#39;s no more unusual  <br/>
than the terms &quot;workers&quot; or &quot;employees&quot; or &quot;residents&quot; or &quot;citizens,  <br/>
as to identifying a group of people, but after years of reading and  <br/>
writing about unschooling, I notice it more, because my own kids have  <br/>
learned &quot;their sums&quot; and &quot;maths&quot; with games to such an extent that the  <br/>
idea that keeping darts scores would help with something actually  <br/>
useful is amusing to me.  Not the idea that it&#39;s true, but that it  <br/>
would be newsworthy, and that it might not be pointed out that ANYone  <br/>
who&#39;s kept darts scores was learning math.  Or bowling, or golf...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m all for that teacher doing that, though!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The original note:<br/>
===========================<br/>
the BBC talks about game to teach maths. It does not happen very  <br/>
often.I though that is a good idea to add to the list of unschooling  <br/>
fun gamesand learning that occurs with it.<br/>

<br/>
We have a neighbor girl that lies a lot.  Chamille has really done<br/>
everything in her power to discourage that friendship because the girl<br/>
lies about everything.  Chamille really disliked the uncertainty about<br/>
wether or not she was being told the truth or not.  To believe a liar,<br/>
makes you feel stupid, but to disbelieve makes you feel bad about not<br/>
trusting someone, either way you don&#39;t know where you stand.<br/>
<br/>
She has other friends that lie to their parents, and that, she&#39;s way<br/>
more understanding about, even though she thinks it stinks to have to do<br/>
that.  I&#39;m really glad that Chamille doesn&#39;t ever feel she needs to lie.<br/>
The one time she did, she wasn&#39;t even lying for herself, it was for the<br/>
protection of a friend that had lied to a parent.  So, just association<br/>
with lying can get one in trouble!</div>
