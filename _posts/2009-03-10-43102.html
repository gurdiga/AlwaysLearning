<div id="ygrps-yiv-1994768118">I am reluctantly selling my complete set of Bill Nye the Science Guy DVDs on ebay. The description follows: This is the complete set of all 100 Bill Nye the Science Guy DVDs. 29 have been opened and some viewed once, the rest are still in their original shrink wrap. Those which are opened have been examined and all are clean. These DVDs are no longer available as a complete set. They are an excellent educational tool to get kids (and adults) interested in science in many aspects. Bill Nye presents all 100 concepts in an entertaining and interesting way. Each DVD contains further information on the topics other than the show itself including Fully indexed &quot;chapters&quot; correlated to National Science Standards, interactive glossaries and quizzes, Bonus footage of segments, interviews and demos, Spanish translations and closed captioning, on-disk implementation guide. Comes with &quot;Consider the Following&quot; a book of science questions, answers and ideas.<br/>
These DVDs play on US systems.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-769484544">For $1900????<br/>
Seriously?<br/>
<br/>
What could I do with $1900 if I decided to just follow my children&#39;s interests rather than invest in loads of videos? <br/>
<br/>
Take a trip to Orlando and eat our way through the Epcott center pavillions, learning all about food and cultures of other places in the world.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/parks/epcot/">http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/parks/epcot/</a><br/>
<br/>
We could purchase our own science lab with really cool stuff from here (it would be hard to spend over $1,000 though as everything is so reasonable!): <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sciplus.com/index.cfm">http://www.sciplus.com/index.cfm</a><br/>
<br/>
We could go to several unschooling gatherings, where my children would have a LOT more fun than watching Bill Nye (as much as we DO love his videos and all). <br/>
<br/>
There are so many wonderful experiences we could create, or useful tools we could purchase that would spark all of our learning and lives in so many ways. I can&#39;t imagine investing in a library of science videos....but maybe I&#39;m weird.<br/>

If you owned an alternative school, that might be a cool thing to have  <br/>
on hand for science.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s quite a bit of Bill Nye stuff at youtube.com!<br/>
