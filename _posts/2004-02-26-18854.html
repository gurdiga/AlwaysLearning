<div id="ygrps-yiv-735751045">I took the advice of the members here and kept my mouth shut with <br/>
all the &quot;schoolish&quot; talk.  I was still anxious but, I decided it was <br/>
my problem.  I stopped discussing what we were doing with all nay <br/>
sayers and I stood in the gap for my son so he wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
questioned or pressured by them either. <br/>
<br/>
I made a list of local activities and sat it on his desk.  Kameron <br/>
came to me and asked about the ones that he was interested in.  When <br/>
we did the first few we had a great time.  At least I was feeling <br/>
like we were doing something.  Then he just started talking about <br/>
things related to what we saw.  He was independantly reading about <br/>
them, watching shows and choosing books to learn more on those and <br/>
related topics.  I would be willing to bet he&#39;s read more, with more <br/>
comprehension in the last month than he has in the last year! And <br/>
he&#39;s reading for longer periods of time and having fun to boot!!<br/>
<br/>
I started believing that everything really is learning.  This moring <br/>
over breakfast he turned to me and said, &quot;I&#39;m accomplishing my <br/>
dreams, I feel like my life is going to be like I always dreamed.&quot; <br/>
He explained about how he&#39;s learning so much about what he wants to <br/>
be when he grows up and how he was going to do it.  At first it was <br/>
just the joy of knowing my child was happy and so positive. (He had <br/>
very negative feelings about himself and learning before.) Then the <br/>
reality and depth of what he said hit me.  WE ARE UNSCHOOLERS AND <br/>
IT&#39;S WORKING!<br/>
<br/>

Thanks for helping with that!  I want to put what you wrote on a website <br/>
somewhere, if you don&#39;t mind.<br/>
<br/>
How old is your son again?  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing that turning point!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1586924026">Definately!! I am so proud of him.  Of you and this group also.  I <br/>
just felt in my heart that you all wouldn&#39;t be so confident and <br/>
content if it weren&#39;t possible.  I thought it would help his self-<br/>
esteem.  Guess who else has gotten an esteem boost?   I&#39;d like to <br/>
get a copy of your posting.  I&#39;ve been doing a scrapbook/journal of <br/>
everything.<br/>
<br/>
Many Blessings-Taunya<br/>

next week will be month 5!<br/>
