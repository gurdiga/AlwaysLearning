<div id="ygrps-yiv-678466352">Our hiatus has evolved into full-blown defunct status despite my denial. <br/>
The energy involved in this project is now expended in other directions, <br/>
and many of our writers have moved on.<br/>
<br/>
I thank our subscribers and writers for making the existing issues <br/>
possible. By way of thanks, I have opened all issues for public access <br/>
in hopes that they will help many families on their unschooling <br/>
journeys. There&#39;s too much wisdom, experience, and insight contained in <br/>
this collection of ezine articles to simply let go.<br/>
<br/>
I will use the remaining subscription money to continue to fund the <br/>
website maintenance both here and at OrganicLearning.org I welcome any <br/>
future donations to keep Connections alive. Please continue to submit <br/>
resources, and I will do my best to keep those pages up to date.<br/>
