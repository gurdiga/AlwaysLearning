SAT talent searches lead nowhere for many<br/>
<br/>
By Laura Vanderkam<br/>
<br/>
As schools across the country prepare their students for annual <br/>
grade-level testing under the No Child Left Behind Act, thousands of <br/>
bright seventh- and eighth-graders are getting ready to take on a <br/>
greater challenge this Saturday: the SAT college entrance exam.<br/>
<br/>
Since 1972, when Professor Julian Stanley of Johns Hopkins <br/>
University first gave high-achieving middle schoolers college <br/>
entrance exams to find exceptional potential, more than 1 million <br/>
children have participated in these &#39;&#39;talent searches&#39;&#39; run by <br/>
universities such as Northwestern, Denver and Duke. Although all <br/>
search participants must score above the 95th percentile on their <br/>
grade-level tests, some will score only the bare minimum on the SAT. <br/>
Others will have near-perfect results.<br/>
<br/>
These scores will help schools determine which students need more <br/>
advanced work than they may be getting in class. At least, that&#39;s <br/>
the idea. Talent searches work best as a compact between students, <br/>
the search program and the school. We will identify profound talent, <br/>
the programs say. Then the program and the school together will <br/>
nurture it.<br/>
<br/>
But talent searches have failed to keep their promise. The SAT can <br/>
identify talent, but because most middle schools do nothing with <br/>
high SAT scores, the promised nurturing tends to take place during <br/>
summer camps run by the search programs themselves. Such programs <br/>
are lifesavers -- for those who can afford them. But until every <br/>
district has a school where the brightest are challenged in an <br/>
environment with their intellectual peers, America can&#39;t claim it&#39;s <br/>
leaving no child behind.<br/>
<br/>
With all of the talk of failing schools these days, few consider <br/>
that schools can shortchange their highest scorers, too. When I <br/>
recently asked several former talent-search participants who scored <br/>
more than 1,000 on the SAT what their schools did with their scores, <br/>
most seemed puzzled by the question. A typical response: &#39;&#39;What <br/>
could they do? I was already in honors math.&#39;&#39; These bright students <br/>
expected to be horribly bored, even in courses aimed at the top <br/>
quarter of the class.<br/>
<br/>
Their schools, flaunting honors English and maybe seventh-grade <br/>
pre-algebra, were also blas√© about providing more. Stephen Shueh did <br/>
well enough on the SAT as a seventh-grader to be able to cover <br/>
algebra and geometry during a talent-search program he took the next <br/>
summer. He came back to eighth grade -- and went right back into <br/>
algebra class.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;Some people may have argued more,&#39;&#39; he says. &#39;&#39;But the school made <br/>
you jump through hoops, and there was no class past algebra in the <br/>
middle school.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Talent-search programs have fought this attitude for years.<br/>
<br/>
The problem, according to Paula Olszewski-Kubilius of Northwestern&#39;s <br/>
Center for Talent Development, is that &#39;&#39;it&#39;s still, unfortunately, <br/>
viewed as something a kid does on her own.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Susan Assouline of the Belin-Blank Center at the University of Iowa <br/>
agrees.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;Julian Stanley saw this from the beginning,&#39;&#39; she says of the <br/>
program&#39;s initiator. &#39;&#39;There have been very slight changes. Now it&#39;s <br/>
no longer phenomenally radical to take algebra in eighth grade.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
But that won&#39;t satisfy kids capable of more. I asked <br/>
Olszewski-Kubilius about a hypothetical seventh-grader who scores a <br/>
650 on the SAT math section.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;That means intellectually she&#39;s functioning at a college level and <br/>
college level for a pretty bright student,&#39;&#39; she says. &#39;&#39;She&#39;s ready <br/>
for an accelerated course of study. She doesn&#39;t need to spend nine <br/>
months doing algebra.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
But she probably will. And she&#39;ll spend years in middle school <br/>
English classes, even honors classes, reading young-adult books and <br/>
writing five-paragraph essays that bore her to tears.<br/>
<br/>
Blend this with middle school social scenes that don&#39;t value smarts <br/>
and no wonder talent searches&#39; summer programs seem like heaven. At <br/>
universities across the country, students zoom through courses such <br/>
as geometry, computer science and literature, covering a whole <br/>
year&#39;s curriculum in three weeks. They revel in bouncing ideas off <br/>
classmates who don&#39;t think they&#39;re freaks for liking to learn. Liz <br/>
Baker, who helped teach a drama/writing class in a program at <br/>
Stanford, says her students &#39;&#39;were like camels who find a lake in <br/>
the desert -- drinking up all the water they could in the short time <br/>
they had.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
These watering spots aren&#39;t cheap. Northwestern&#39;s program, for <br/>
instance, costs $2,200 a session. So most of the students <br/>
participating hail from the upper middle class. Kids from <br/>
less-privileged backgrounds, who need the experience most, usually <br/>
don&#39;t get it.<br/>
<br/>
For these students&#39; sake, every school district that promises a free <br/>
and appropriate education needs to replicate these heady <br/>
intellectual environments -- during the school year.<br/>
<br/>
Mike Klibaner found classes at his Staten Island, N.Y., middle <br/>
school underwhelming. He, too, escaped his boredom for a few weeks <br/>
in the summer with a class at Franklin & Marshall College.<br/>
<br/>
But because Klibaner lived in New York, he could apply to one of the <br/>
city&#39;s prize-winning magnet high schools -- in his case, Stuyvesant. <br/>
Stuyvesant&#39;s entrance exam, like a talent search, identifies New <br/>
York&#39;s brightest from a sea of high achievers. Then Stuyvesant helps <br/>
these students learn all they can absorb in one of the country&#39;s <br/>
most challenging high schools.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;Everything changed there because I was no longer an outcast among <br/>
the general student body,&#39;&#39; Klibaner says. To stretch his mind while <br/>
surrounded by students who loved to learn, Klibaner was willing to <br/>
travel almost two hours daily, each way.<br/>
<br/>
Fulfilling the promise of talent searches means every district needs <br/>
a Stuyvesant and a middle-school equivalent. Smaller districts can <br/>
combine to provide a critical mass of gifted students for these <br/>
schools -- like Klibaner, the kids will travel. More isolated <br/>
districts can still create magnet programs to concentrate the <br/>
brightest, give them teachers trained to aim two-to-three grade <br/>
levels higher and adjust the curriculum to challenge students who <br/>
need more.<br/>
<br/>
A dozen states fund residential gifted high schools, usually only <br/>
for juniors and seniors. All states should have these schools, and <br/>
they should serve more than just two grades.<br/>
<br/>
These solutions aren&#39;t terribly expensive. Magnet schools cost just <br/>
a bit more for transportation, and residential schools cost no more <br/>
than what states spend per child on special education. Gifted <br/>
children have special needs, too.<br/>
<br/>
But because some people find such programs elitist, most districts <br/>
do not provide them and do little with talent searches beyond <br/>
congratulating the high scorer.<br/>
<br/>
After all, a seventh-grader who can&#39;t read seems more of a crisis <br/>
than a seventh-grader whose mind is shutting down from learning <br/>
fractions again.<br/>
<br/>
Still, leaving no child behind doesn&#39;t require squelching those who <br/>
want to surge ahead. Talent searches can find these children. <br/>
Ignoring their gifts denies them the education they deserve.<br/>

than the average high school senior who took the test. I ended up<br/>

Last night she was writing thank you notes for her birthday party (which<br/>
was all her idea, since I&#39;ve always been of the opinion that thanking<br/>
someone in person means you don&#39;t have to write a note, but if you want<br/>
to it&#39;s always a nice gesture) and she was writing about all the things<br/>
she&#39;d made with the kits a friend had gotten her. She asked me, &quot;Should<br/>
there be those fwooshy things here and here?&quot; and pointed right where two<br/>
commas should go. Yup. I was so impressed. The only punctuation marks I<br/>
remember talking about with her are periods and apostrophes, so she must<br/>
have just remembered commas from reading... very cool.<br/>
