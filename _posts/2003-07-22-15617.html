Well after sharing the RUL list address here, someone sent me the following.  <br/>
It&#39;s pretty horrible.   This is from someone who wouldn&#39;t even say if she was <br/>
an unschooler or had kids.<br/>

Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
Newbie here and former casualty of the infamous Sandra Dodd. Actually<br/>
not me personally so much, but I just witnessed the most nasty attack<br/>
(and many others having read this other list&#39;s archives) on another<br/>
list she is on. What led me to the other list initially was Ms. Dodds<br/>
articles. I was sadly suprised to see, no...I was shocked to see how<br/>
she responds to people who don&#39;t agree with her.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure alligator hide is enough Lynda. She has quite an enemy<br/>
camp going for her. How very sad that is to see. I wonder if she<br/>
actually wrote those articles herself. I&#39;m shocked. It simply doesn&#39;t<br/>
appear to be the same person in the articles that I see on this other<br/>
list, nor does it appear she practices what she so passionately<br/>
preaches. To the contrary. I&#39;ve not seen such aggression on a list<br/>
before.<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, I&#39;ll take a deep cleansing breath and be grateful to be on<br/>
this list.<br/>
<br/>
Peace to all,<br/>
Jeva</div>

&lt;&lt; Man, I&#39;m sorry you have to deal with this kind of crap, Sandra.    &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The really sad thing is that I haven&#39;t finished my e-mail all week!!!  I had <br/>
company (Brenda Leonard and her son Tim just left this afternoon) and am WAY <br/>
behind on www.unschooling.com and have still not yet gotten to the end of <br/>
e-mail, and have been running around until my leg hurt and I couldn&#39;t go anymore <br/>
every day, and having a great time.   So most of the posts on the list were NOT <br/>
mine, most of the stuff was responded to before I ever got there, yet as it <br/>
begins to settle out, people are blaming me singularly as though I&#39;d been the <br/>
only one there.<br/>
<br/>
Then, it turns out, it seems, those new people who showed up were summoned or <br/>
came to hoot like monkeys just to make trouble, from another list where I&#39;m <br/>
being discussed behind my back.    <br/>
<br/>
Talking about unschooling is good.  Talking about bullshit to amuse <br/>
bullshitters is way less useful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1223997226">Pam, Thanks for the advice, but really its all about real people and I&#39;m thankful.  Some of the stuff may seem mean and silly, but at least people are saying whats really on their minds and not silly silly stuff they can&#39;t or won&#39;t do. I&#39;m ok with it, actually its interesting to hear what people really think/feel/ believe that makes me realize I do or don&#39;t think/feel/ believe as they do OR maybe I do.  I did like the lightbulbs analogy though.  I have a terrible or maybe its good, sense of humor that keeps me going but I can get some strange looks... I&#39;m sorry for Sandra, although I&#39;m sure she doesn&#39;t need me to be... As for that, it is sometimes hard to write in email what you want to say without hurting some sensitive folks feelings when they are whining LOL, just the facts ma&#39;am and thank you very much.

P.S. But the facts can be boring............<br/>
