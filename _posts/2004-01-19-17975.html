<div id="ygrps-yiv-271202281">Hello all! <br/>
I wanted to say hello to the Missourian I saw who posted earlier as <br/>
I am in Missouri also about 20 minutes from Columbia. <br/>
Also I wanted to reply that we are also unschooling our ONLY child <br/>
who is almost 6, he just lost his first baby tooth this last week <br/>
which was an exciting ordeal for him -- he very patiently waited 3 <br/>
days until it prettymuch popped out! He didn&#39;t want to touch it <br/>
because he was afraid it would hurt - This coming from a child who <br/>
can skin both knees and barely give a sad look before going back to <br/>
play! I am just so amazed how quickly he is growing up! <br/>
As for being the only child he is very social and had never had <br/>
problems with quickly making friends, there are a lot of schooled <br/>
neighborhood kids who come over after their school as well to play <br/>
for a couple of hours. What we are doing now is that I am also <br/>
caring for a 3 1/2 year old who I have had while his mother works <br/>
since he was a small baby so it&#39;s not like I think my son feels like <br/>
he is even an only sometimes, perhaps on the weekends he feels it <br/>
most, but I don&#39;t think he ever lacks for anything to do or anyone <br/>
to play with, he can always ask me or his dad as well. <br/>
However I am trying to start a school in this area based on the <br/>
Sudbury model which is similar (yet different I know) to <br/>
unschooling, because I see a great need for this type of educational <br/>
situation in my area. But reguardless we are never going to &quot;public <br/>
school&quot; and we are definately unschooling until we get the &quot;school&quot; <br/>
going so I hope I can still get some support here. I just looked <br/>
over the website of a new &quot;Free&quot; school that is starting up in AZ <br/>
and it looks SOOOO nice and they are expecting to keep up paying <br/>
their staff with &quot;donations&quot; - 2 pools and 7 acres to roam... ??? <br/>
But I would take kids into our school for really no payment as I am <br/>
lucky enough to have a hubby who pays prettymuch the big bills and <br/>
as long as were not asking for more than food and shelter we&#39;re not <br/>
going into debt... However I&#39;m not sure if I could get the tutors or <br/>
equipment that the kids will ask for from the parents &quot;donations&quot; <br/>
Who knows! I&#39;m rambling anyhow ... Hope everyone has a nice night.</div>
