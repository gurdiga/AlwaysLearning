<div id="ygrps-yiv-1725360874">Hey,<br/>
   I only needed a waiver once, so I researched what the law said and <br/>
basically wrote it word for word  with some scripture thrown in. It was a minor <br/>
hassle! I have friends with a vaccine damaged child. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1615270116">What state do you need a vax exemption for? Some states -- I think about 17 -- also allow for a philosophical objection, and some other allow for very vaguely stated religious objections that do not require church membership, Christian or otherwise.  <br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t have any links handy, but a quick google for vaccine exemptions should yield lots of results. You might narrow it by adding your state in the search line.<br/>
 <br/>
good luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-513544688">I just had to deal with this at school.  I was given by the school nurse <br/>
a bunch of forms to give to certain kids, who are missing some <br/>
vacination.  The school nurse highlighted where the parent can sign so <br/>
the school can give the vaccination themselves.  Amazing, I didn&#39;t <br/>
realize that this happened.  THe parents don&#39;t even have to be present, <br/>
the school can just get the signature (and some parents truely don&#39;t <br/>
know what they are signing) and the kid is called into the nurses office <br/>
and the nurse gives the vaccine and the kid goes back to class.  There <br/>
is a very tiny line at the bottom where the parents can sign if they <br/>
don&#39;t want the child to receive the vaccination but it is really hard to <br/>
understand what they are signing--if you don&#39;t speak English or don&#39;t <br/>
have a college education, you might not understand that all you are <br/>
signing is that you don&#39;t want your child to get the vaccine.  I just <br/>
bit my tongue and gave out the sheet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-66231594">Here in Oklahoma you can object for personal or philosophical reasons.   My oldest daughter attended public school for K and two months of 1st grade.  The office staff gave me a pretty hard time about it and the school nurse really let me have it.  I stood my ground though. <br/>
<br/>
Are there states where you really don&#39;t have a choice?  any choice at all? That&#39;s scary.<br/>

Mississippi and West Virginia allow for only a medical exemption from mandatory vaxes, that can only be obtained from an MD.  <br/>
 <br/>
 And there are some states, (don&#39;t know which ones) that require one be a member of a &#39;recognized church&#39; with stated objections to vaxing as part of church theology.  Here in New Mexico, we have a conscientious objection exemption where we complete a form, basically we are personally opposed to the introduction of vaccine products into the body as part of our personal religious beliefs, no church affiliation required.<br/>

www.thinktwice.com has links to all the states laws and how to get an exemption as does an article by Dr Mercola (lost the URL)<br/>
<br/>
We have used tge RE exemption although no-one has ever asked if my kids are vaccinated or not. Even the one time one of them saw a doctor.<br/>
