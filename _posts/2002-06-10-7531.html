 It&#39;s thirty two degrees and the snow is sticking to the lilacs and<br/>

spraying it off the poor trees, hoping to keep them from breaking.   Last<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Shyrley, Montana is beautiful and for the most part moderate.  It&#39;s an<br/>
easy state to unschool in, too.  If you can get past the DOL killing<br/>
bison all winter long with your tax dollars and the other politics of<br/>
insanity, you can have eighty days to try to grow tomatoes, and then ski<br/>
around happily the rest of the year. <br/>

Wow.  <br/>
<br/>
Will it kill all the vegetables people have planted?  Will they have time to <br/>
replant?<br/>
<br/>
The other night it was nearly 9:00, still light to the west, pink sky, and <br/>
breezy.  But the breeze wasn&#39;t cool, it was hot.  That&#39;s not normal here.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Most things should be ok.  Folks around here cover their tender plants at<br/>
night anyway, because usual night time temperatures, even without snow<br/>
can dip pretty low.  The wet snow comes  gently, laying the little plants<br/>
down, not beating them down like hail would.  I&#39;ve covered my lettuce and<br/>
squash and tomatoes and such, the beans are just cracking the surface and<br/>
should be fine, the peas won&#39;t care about snow at all neither will the<br/>
cabbages and cauliflower.   People will lose their lovely flower boxes<br/>
though, if they didn&#39;t find a way to cover them.  The greenhouses will be<br/>
happily open for business on the first sunny day! <br/>
<br/>
The worst danger is to the trees.  Leafed out like they are, this heavy<br/>
snow clings and presses them to breaking.  In the winter, when they&#39;re<br/>
dormant and have no leaves to collect the snow they&#39;re stiff and sturdy. <br/>
But now, they&#39;re so suseptable to breakage, and with the ground wet and<br/>
not frozen, up rooting.  <br/>

I walked to K in Great Falls through a tunnel of snow.<br/>
 We ate watermelon in July in the snow :-)<br/>

year later.   We all felt motivated to save it because it&#39;s one my dad<br/>
grew from a seed!   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-424091938">I used your idea, Julie.  And got some response from<br/>
the Christian school-at-homers.  There are some Mama&#39;s<br/>
and kids coming tomorrow. 12-2 or 3 pm<br/>
<br/>
I feel a little apprehensive, but also feel it is my<br/>
duty to get some kids out here. Gosh I hope they can<br/>
have fun and not spend the whole time witnessing.<br/>
Perhaps they can view having a good time as<br/>
witnessing. And I am so wiped out from the<br/>
critters....dunno how I can be a good hostess and<br/>
facilitator of fun kid stuff. I told them to bring<br/>
towels and snacks. None of them have ever been in the<br/>
river, here....even though they all live near by for<br/>
their whole lives...grownups, too.  Sometimes I forget<br/>
(ignore) how different we live from the mainstream. <br/>

Are you still doing your Recess?<br/>
