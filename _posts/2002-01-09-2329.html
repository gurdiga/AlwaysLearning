<div id="ygrps-yiv-642744674">&lt;&lt;She has all along said she<br/>
loved it, but what I see she really loves is<br/>
the social, and I think she realized that the<br/>
confounds of school makes the social she love<br/>
just not happen.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My daughter went back to school for her senior year last year after<br/>
homeschooling since third grade and she considers it one of the best<br/>
decisions she&#39;s made. There is such a dearth of homeschooling kids of the<br/>
not-religious persuasion here and school (Waldorf) gave her a chance to make<br/>
some great friends. The academic stuff she had to tolerate, but she was<br/>
up-front with them about why she was there (for social/life-expanding<br/>
reasons) and they seemed to respect that.<br/>
<br/>
During the course of the year we had many discussions about how great it<br/>
would be if school were just a place where kids could go to hang out<br/>
together and learn whatever they wanted.<br/>
