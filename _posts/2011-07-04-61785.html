<div id="ygrps-yiv-337184833">Can anybody direct me to any good articles about unschooling that are <br/>
written in Spanish or are good translations?<br/>
I have some Spanish-speaking relatives visiting and they are interested <br/>
- one is struggling through Sandra&#39;s book, but it isn&#39;t easy reading for <br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
