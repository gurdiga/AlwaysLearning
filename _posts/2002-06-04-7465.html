<div id="ygrps-yiv-1056950309">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
One of the moms in my homeschooling group had a daughter that really wanted <br/>
to try school. Debbe, the mom, thought it would be too much of a burden for <br/>
just the one child to go.<br/>
<br/>
They made a compromise, and after working it out with the school, the <br/>
daughter attended two days a week.  This was years ago - and I don&#39;t remember <br/>
how long the daughter went to school -- I think it was for a few months - <br/>
then she was done with it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1628553984">My daughters wanted to try school this year.&nbsp; We tried to get them into the public Montessori program, but they didn&#39;t get in (lottery system), so we enrolled them in K and 3rd grade at the local public school.&nbsp; My 8yo went for about two weeks before realizing that she wasn&#39;t interested in what they had to offer.&nbsp; She was there long enough to have a math assessment which showed her to be at the end of third/beginning of fourth grade level.&nbsp; This is a girl who has never been required to do any math.&nbsp; Everything she has learned has been through her own joyful exploration.&nbsp; When we withdrew her the teacher told me to make sure I follow the curriculum guidelines set by the state so she doesn&#39;t fall behind.&nbsp; I just smiled and said thanks.&nbsp; My 5yo just recently decided not to continue to go to school.&nbsp; She really liked it at first.&nbsp; I think they do more to make it fun in the beginning of Kindergarten, but as the year wore on things started getting more rigid and she didn&#39;t like that.&nbsp; &quot;Why do I have to start my letters at the top? Who cares where I start my letters?!?&quot;&nbsp; So we are all back at home now.&nbsp; It&#39;s been cool to see how confident my daughters were in trying out a new situation and in walking away from it when it didn&#39;t feel right.&nbsp; I was able to partner with them to create the experience they were seeking without a bunch of fear and dogma getting in the way.&nbsp; I owe a lot to the things I&#39;ve read on this list over the years.&nbsp; I am a much more calm and confident mom because of it.&nbsp; Thanks, everyone!&nbsp;</div>
