<br/>
<br/>
Reject it. Yes, for now. Banish ALL school-think now. Every bit of it. You <br/>
need to DEschool FIRST, then you can start looking at some &quot;schooly&quot; things as <br/>
OK. More experienced unschoolers: ignore my school-speak.<br/>
<br/>
Because you&#39;re looking at things in a &quot;schooly&quot; way, I want you to do this <br/>
for me. You&#39;ve just been enrolled in &quot;The Church of John Holt School&quot;.  The <br/>
headmistress/guru is Sandra Dodd (it&#39;s her list, after all). Your &quot;teachers&quot; are <br/>
all the experienced posters on this e-list (It&#39;s an internet based school.). <br/>
They each have different &quot;specalties, but they all &quot;get it&quot;, so we&#39;re all on the <br/>
same page.<br/>
<br/>
Joyce is our voice of reason--she has a brilliant way of breaking things down <br/>
for beginners and her anaolgies are spot-on! <br/>
pam (little p) is our math wiz, who will make sure you know that you are <br/>
surrounded by math daily and how best to *see* it. <br/>
Deb L can get a little loud about rights of children, so she&#39;s our children&#39;s <br/>
advocate; she&#39;s also my comic relief. <br/>
Ren is our &quot;spiritual leader&quot; and a perfect example of someone who struggled <br/>
to get here (her whole, strange trip is available in the archives of <br/>
unschooling.com boards) . <br/>
Kathryn&#39;s our new unschooling conference coordinator, enabling you to meet <br/>
all these fine folks IRL. <br/>
Pam H had understood unschooling before her oldest could even walk!<br/>
Mary (Zenmomma) understands kids who are &quot;labeled&quot; and can move you away from <br/>
labels quickly.<br/>
My husband last night called me the &quot;Billy Graham of UNschooling&quot;. I am the <br/>
evangelist---I scream the loudest!  And I want to convert you! &lt;BWG&gt;. <br/>
<br/>
Others of you &quot;teachers&quot;, please write in and tell me your specialties----I&#39;m <br/>
busy typing, and although I don&#39;t want to exclude anyone, I&#39;m on a <br/>
rollllllll.....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But right now, you&#39;re in UNschooling kindergarten. We want you to <br/>
PLAY----just like in &quot;old-time kindergarten&quot;. We need for you to understand that PLAYING <br/>
is LEARNING. <br/>
<br/>
This is the first &quot;rule&quot; of unschooling. PLAY!<br/>
<br/>
Second rule. Everything counts. Everything you learn----on purpose or <br/>
accidentally----counts. You WILL eventually make a connection with that tiny bit of <br/>
information you discovered yesterday. Give it time. Connect the dots.<br/>
<br/>
Third Rule. You will only remember what is important to Y-O-U! And that can <br/>
change over time. The best way to learn things is through immersion IN those <br/>
things. Passions.<br/>
<br/>
Rule four. ALL things are connected. ALL THINGS! You know the &quot;Seven Degrees <br/>
of Separation of Kevin Bacon? I promise that there are fewer than seven <br/>
degrees between all things in the universe. Try us! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Rule five. There is NO division in UNschooling. Now before pam (little p) <br/>
chimes in with 6/3, let me clarify. We do NOT divide the world into &quot;subjects&quot;. <br/>
Math is art is science is history is music is literature. It&#39;s all related and <br/>
inter-related. YOUR school makes these divisions; The Church of John Holt <br/>
School does not.<br/>
<br/>
Rule six. Well-roundedness is over-rated. At the same time, by immersing <br/>
yourself into a passion, you automatically cover all the &quot;badschool subjects&quot;. You <br/>
can&#39;t help it!<br/>
<br/>
Rule seven. Ban Book Worship! You need to see all methods of getting <br/>
knowledge into the brain as equal. Books may take a back-seat in a child&#39;s learning <br/>
for a while. That&#39;s OK. There are MANY ways to obtain information: TV, games, <br/>
eating out/eating IN, movies, vacations, talking,----yeah! just plain old <br/>
enagaging each other in conversation! <br/>
<br/>
Rule eight. The only times we cannot learn are 1) when we are in a coma (and <br/>
I don&#39;t know that for sure). 2) when we are frightened. Learning stops when we <br/>
are scared. and 3) when we are forced. Coersion is not conducive to true <br/>
learning. Regurgitation, maybe. Learning, NO.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure there are some more &quot;school rules&quot; that some of our other &quot;teachers&quot; <br/>
can add, but....I&#39;m on a rollllll....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
AFTER you ban the school-think and school-speak from your mind, THEN you can <br/>
slowly start adding it in. But as unschooling &quot;teachers&quot;, our first lesson is <br/>
to get you to leave those words and acts behind. We *have to* get you to see <br/>
that you are surrounded by opportunities to learn. You can&#39;t escape it. You&#39;re <br/>
hard-wired to learn.<br/>
<br/>
DEschooling is the healing process that takes place after school----for YOU <br/>
and the child. You can&#39;t rush it any more than you can rush a broken leg to <br/>
heal. You *can* do things to relieve that pain though. Offer to read to him. Take <br/>
him out to the new Korean restaurant. Most importantly, stay away from <br/>
&quot;classes and lessons&quot; until he&#39;s ready to accept them as &quot;just another option&quot;. Our <br/>
culture puts too much emphasis on classes and lessons and teachers and <br/>
requirements and such. You&#39;ll need to keep that at arm&#39;s length for a while until you <br/>
are comfortable with the idea that you CAN learn without them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Isn&#39;t part of it having the choice to choose what you want to learn <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and how you learn it?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Once you&#39;re comfortable with the idea that classes aren&#39;t the be-all-end-all, <br/>
then you can offer some kind of specialty class---like karate or riding <br/>
lessons or piano (Consider that John Holt High School).  AFTER you know in your <br/>
heart of hearts that ALL learning is equal, that ALL learning can be obtained <br/>
from *living*, THEN classes may eke into your unschooling life (College of John <br/>
Holt).<br/>
<br/>
OK. I&#39;m going to send this before I lose it! &lt;G&gt; The rest of the faculty can <br/>
join in. Maybe we can make it into a booklet for de-/unschooling! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2000435212">Billy Graham for sure!  Wow.  That was a heck of a sermon.  Weird, but fun.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Isn&#39;t part of it having the choice to choose what you want to <br/>
learn <br/>
and how you learn it?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Util you really understand that formal instruction is not necessary, you <br/>
won&#39;t be making a choice.  You&#39;ll be acting from fear and habit.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s truly worth doing, as an exercise.<br/>
And it becomes NOT just an exercise, soon after you start.  It becomes a <br/>
shift in thinking and a new awareness.   You don&#39;t even have to leave your chair, <br/>
just start hearing your own words and your own thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something to maybe help:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1358214035">Let me give you an &quot;AMEN!&quot;  Play I can definately do.  And do it we <br/>
will! I printed this post out twice.  One to hang by my mirror and <br/>
the other to keep in my planner.  <br/>
<br/>
Just reading this just brought to my attention although you didn&#39;t <br/>
say it, that right now I&#39;m acting like a control freak.  The sad <br/>
thing is I&#39;m trying to control something that not only does not need <br/>
my overbearing control but also will be hindered if I don&#39;t loosen <br/>
up. Just call me Lenny. ;-&gt;<br/>
