<br/>
THIS IS COOL.  I found it because I put in a CD I own and told iTunes  <br/>
not to import it, but when iTunes came up it showed classical albums,  <br/>
down along the bottom.  I clicked on this one to see what it was.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s 34 songs, with a booklet, for $9.99 and I&#39;m getting it.  It&#39;s  <br/>
not only Halloween soundtrack, it has recognizably familiar things  <br/>
that will bring back all kinds of memories.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t recommend using it to go to sleep at night, or for calming  <br/>
peaceful music when someone&#39;s depressed.  But for occasional special  <br/>
use or a Halloween party, it seems perfect.<br/>
<br/>
Most songs can be bought individually, too.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s most cool is that its release date is October 17, 2006.  It&#39;s  <br/>
just new today!  Had I not woken up at 3:30 I couldn&#39;t have told you  <br/>
about it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s one listed on Amazon by the same name, but it only has twelve  <br/>
pieces, the cover is different and the reviews aren&#39;t great.  This  <br/>
has almost three times as much music for the same price, but I can&#39;t  <br/>
send a link because iTunes isn&#39;t like that.  Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
