<div id="ygrps-yiv-1153224056">I&#39;ve seen the NOVA presentation of Musical Minds for the second time  <br/>
now, both by chance, and I&#39;m thrilled that I saw it.  It&#39;s an Oliver  <br/>
Sachs program, about music and brain function.   A DVD costs $44.95  <br/>
and that&#39;s a lot.    It seems you can watch it online.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to link it on my music page, but first I&#39;d like to know  <br/>
whether people in Canada, Europe or the Pacific can even get onto that  <br/>
site, or if there are DVDs available in other formats.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1364305869">Oh!  And for those in the U.S. who can see it, it will only be  <br/>
available free until July 7:<br/>

Note: Due to rights restrictions, this program is only available for  <br/>
streaming on the NOVA website for one week, from July 1-7, 2009.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you can even read the chapters, it&#39;s cool, though, and this is one  <br/>
of those shows that just won&#39;t work in a book (like The History of  <br/>
English, which did have a companion book, but the best part was  <br/>
hearing the accents).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hearing the music is the best part.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-14295208">I live in Europe (The Netherlands) and I can&#39;t see the program.<br/>
<br/>
I get this message when I try to watch the first part:<br/>
&quot;We&#39;re sorry, but due to rights restrictions this program is only available for online viewing in the United States. You appear to be connected to the Internet from outside this area. <br/>

For viewers in Canada who may support nearby public television stations in the United States, we appreciate your support but regrettably cannot legally offer this programming online outside the United States. <br/>

Thanks for letting me know.  As it detects my location, it lets me  <br/>
watch without telling me who can&#39;t watch.<br/>
<br/>
Well darn.  I won&#39;t put it on my site, but I hope it becomes widely  <br/>
available before long and for less than $50.<br/>
