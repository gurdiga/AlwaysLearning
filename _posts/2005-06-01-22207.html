<div id="ygrps-yiv-1144367590">**The Science Museum in St. Paul occasionally has slumber parties, now <br/>
Ithink I&#39;ll have to find out when, &#39;cause my young scientist would <br/>
probably get a kick out of sleeping with the dinosaurs.**<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve slept over in the Monterey Bay Aquarium, and they still have those, at least in summer.  I think the fee is high, like $50 per, and may only be for members.<br/>

PS  The minimum of age is 6, and we had the chance to do it when James was 6 years 4 days old, or 6.01 years of age. &lt;g&gt;</div>
