true that Tim talks to very few people.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There is a girl in our neighborhood.  When we first met her, she was about 5.  The first time she came over for a playdate, her mom explained that she probably wouldn&#39;t talk to me.  If I wanted to know something, I could ask my kids to ask her and she would tell them.  Her mom wanted me to understand that she wasn&#39;t being rude, she simply wasn&#39;t comfortable talking to adults she didn&#39;t know well.<br/>
<br/>
Now she is 8, is sometimes here at our house for hours at a time, and talks to me just fine.<br/>
