<div id="ygrps-yiv-1621346126">Relativism taken to the extreme does indeed mean all choices are <br/>
valid.  It depends on what level the person sets as the relative <br/>
measure.  Pure and complete relativism means a choice is only good or <br/>
bad in respect to each individual person.  Others set the relative <br/>
measure higher at nationality, ethnicity, religion, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Subjectivism is the theory that there is no set in stone absolute <br/>
right/wrong choice, but that some choices are so overwhelmingly seen <br/>
as good or bad that they must for all practical purposes be <br/>
considered good or bad.  Your example of nakedness is a good <br/>
illustration of subjective morality.  <br/>
<br/>
For example, honor killings (ie, killing of raped girls by their <br/>
family for the insult of bringing shame on the family) in the middle <br/>
east would be seen as bad by a moral subjectivist, but seen as an OK <br/>
choice for a moral relativist who sets the measure at religion or <br/>
ethnicity, or lower.<br/>
<br/>
These two concepts are confused often and in the case of dishonest <br/>
people arguing for religion, are often confused on purpose.  It is <br/>
semantics, but can be very important to many discussions.<br/>
