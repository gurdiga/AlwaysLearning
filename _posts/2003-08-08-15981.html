<div id="ygrps-yiv-1298271923">Writing is a challenge for Julian, which is such a struggle for his mom, a <br/>
writer.  What we&#39;ve discovered is he&#39;ll write if it&#39;s real, and not just a <br/>
&quot;schooly&quot; thing (which he got in his very few years of school). This is his writing <br/>
story.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, he says he hates to write, but has begun writing songs :), and <br/>
intends to be a singer/songwriter.<br/>
<br/>
When he was little (well, 8) and we started homeschooling, we lived across <br/>
the street from a funky little restaurant (three tables). One day I invited him <br/>
to go there and have lunch and write poetry. I think he was so startled he <br/>
agreed. LOL So we went over, and I taught him about haiku. He liked the <br/>
structure, the fact that it was short, and that it was usually about nature, being an <br/>
animal freak. This was his first poem, about our cat:<br/>
<br/>
Simone<br/>
<br/>
soft loving kitty<br/>
a tortoise shell cat in the sun<br/>
a very patient feline.<br/>
<br/>
He was happy with it, and impressed that he could write a poem he felt was <br/>
&quot;good.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
He was happy with that, and that same day wrote this poem, about our friend <br/>
Sarah&#39;s guide dog, who Julian was good friends with and took care of sometimes. <br/>
At the time, Sarah&#39;s old guide dog was retiring, and she was getting a new <br/>
one. Julian loved the first dog very much. The poem is advice from the old dog <br/>
to the new dog.<br/>
<br/>
Sarah&#39;s eyes<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Walk with pride.<br/>
Be the best guide dog<br/>
you can possibly be.<br/>
Be a loving friend.<br/>
Keep her safe.<br/>
Wear the harness well.<br/>
<br/>
His next big writing adventure was pretty dramatic. The church we belonged to <br/>
had a very serious mouse problem. They&#39;d started out putting out a few humane <br/>
traps, and it didn&#39;t help. Finally, they had to call an exterminator, who <br/>
laughed at them, saying there were hundreds of mice in the dropped ceiling of the <br/>
basement.<br/>
<br/>
Julian heard about this, and was devastated. He had worked at the food pantry <br/>
at church, and knew the mice had to go, but he was very upset at the loss of <br/>
life. We talked about the problem of people leaving food around at the church, <br/>
etc. He ended up writing an article for the church newsletter about it. An <br/>
excerpt: &quot;This makes me sad because they killed hundreds of small mice and their <br/>
babies. I understand why they had to get rid of the mice. They were spoiling <br/>
the food for the food pantry and because having that many mice around can <br/>
cause disease.<br/>
<br/>
I want people to not leave food out so mice don&#39;t smell it and come into the <br/>
church so we don&#39;t have another disaster. I want people to do this because <br/>
more than 200 mice died in this disaster....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In the past few years, Julian&#39;s done some other writing. A couple years ago <br/>
my sister sent something about an essay writing contest about vegetarianism. I <br/>
didn&#39;t think Juls would be interested (because he doesn&#39;t like to write much), <br/>
but he was. We talked a bit about why he was a vegetarian, and I gave him a <br/>
few materials on what other people thought about it, and he wrote an amazing <br/>
essay about vegetarianism as a spitirual practice. He quoted Plutarch and Gandhi <br/>
in it!!! He ended up doing his essay as a sermon at church, as well as <br/>
entering the contest.<br/>
<br/>
So, Julian is actually a pretty good writer, but doesn&#39;t do it much, and <br/>
doesn&#39;t love it. But when there&#39;s a purpose, he does a good job at it.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s decided to take a course at Harvard University Extension this fall, on <br/>
Evolution and Society. He&#39;s excited. We told him we thought there might be <br/>
writing he had to do for it, and that we&#39;d help him learn to write an academic <br/>
paper if he wanted (in the context of writing his first one). He&#39;s excited enough <br/>
about the course that he feels that it&#39;s worth doing the writing.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-935061614">Thank you for sharing that, Kathryn.  I&#39;ve been avidly reading what you <br/>
have all written because I&#39;m already getting a lot of pressure from <br/>
family about Aislinn and her inability and complete disinterest in <br/>
reading and writing.  It&#39;s so comforting to hear about everyone else&#39;s <br/>
children.  Aislinn&#39;s only 7 and busy living her life which doesn&#39;t, at <br/>
this point, involve writing or reading.  <br/>
<br/>
My dh understands what unschooling is, but doesn&#39;t wholeheartedly agree. <br/>
 Last week he told Aislinn (when I wasn&#39;t around) that he wanted to sit <br/>
with her at night and work on her reading.  Aislinn told me about it and <br/>
I asked her how she felt about it and she said it was okay.  But Aislinn <br/>
would say that if she thought she should even if it wasn&#39;t true (a sad <br/>
fact of the way our life used to be).  The thing is...my dh spends so <br/>
little time with the girls that part of me feels maybe it wouldn&#39;t be a <br/>
bad thing.  I asked him about it and he said he felt she needed to start <br/>
working harder on it.  I asked him if he was going to do this with both <br/>
older girls because Elysia not only wants to do EVERYTHING Aislinn does, <br/>
Elysia is actually more inclined to write stuff and can write more than <br/>
Aislinn can.  Elysia is 5.  Dh said he only wanted to work with Aislinn <br/>
because she&#39;ll just feel bad if Elysia&#39;s quicker about it than her.  I <br/>
agree with that, but he can&#39;t tell Elysia to just go away when it&#39;s <br/>
something she&#39;s interested in.  I don&#39;t know what to do.  Probably I <br/>
won&#39;t have to do anything, because I doubt dh will do anything. <br/>
 Unfortunately it&#39;s these little episodes that, I think, make Aislinn <br/>
less interested in writing (and reading) because she closes down when <br/>
pressured.  To keep commenting on her inability to read is like jabbing <br/>
at her and then walking away.  Oh...if only everyone would just let it <br/>
go and try to understand more.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for your stories about your children.  I&#39;m printing them <br/>
to make a little booklet.  All part of my Unschooling Bible.  <br/>
