<div id="ygrps-yiv-196679018">Thank you for the responses, and especially the direction to a <br/>
number of links.   I&#39;ll be looking at those in the days ahead.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to add to the situation we are in with our 15 year old, <br/>
because I&#39;m not sure but what we may be talking at cross purposes.<br/>
I mentioned her IQ, not because I put faith in this score, but <br/>
because it is one part of the effort we&#39;ve been making to figure out <br/>
what is going on.   I have no clue what my other seven children&#39;s IQ <br/>
scores are, or mine, or my husband&#39;s.    It would never, never occur <br/>
to me to even consider testing one of the other children.    But <br/>
this child is struggling in ways I&#39;ve never encountered.   We have <br/>
no medical history of her before we adopted her when she was six.   <br/>
We have no information as to what she might have been exposed to in <br/>
utero.   We do know, however, that something is clearly limiting her <br/>
abilities.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra asked if she has access to using money.   Of course.   She <br/>
gets an allowance and is expected to pay for certain expenses, such <br/>
as going to movies, buying gifts for friends, buying snacks and much <br/>
more. We play board games routinely.    She helps me in the kitchen <br/>
with preparing meals that involve the use of recipes in cookbooks.  <br/>
She has a digital watch, digital alarm clock, calendars, appointment <br/>
books.    There are areas in which she hasn&#39;t been able to make <br/>
connections that I would think would be fairly normal for a fifteen <br/>
year old.    <br/>
<br/>
For example, she can&#39;t count the money in her wallet.   She doesn&#39;t <br/>
know if she has enough money to make a purchase.   If she has two <br/>
tens, three fives, and seven ones, plus change, she won&#39;t know if <br/>
she can buy something that costs $12 because there is no $12 <br/>
bill.    When counting coins, if she has three quarters and three <br/>
dimes, she can&#39;t figure out how much that is.   I have tried to help <br/>
her make these connections in as many ways as I know.    <br/>
<br/>
She cannot keep days of the week straight from months of the year.   <br/>
She can&#39;t name all the months and she doesn&#39;t know what month <br/>
Christmas occurs in.    She can&#39;t get the connection as to what <br/>
month comes after December.   We use calendars all the time, trying <br/>
to present ideas that much younger children are typically absorbing.<br/>
<br/>
Recently she was helping as an usher at a ballet performance for an <br/>
out-of-town touring company.   She couldn&#39;t direct people to their <br/>
seats because she doesn&#39;t know the alphabet well enough to recognize <br/>
where the different letters will fall in the rows at the theatre.   <br/>
She literally was taking people to the front of the auditorium, then <br/>
advancing up the stairs until she got to the correct row.  <br/>
<br/>
When helping me cook, she can&#39;t differentiate between the different <br/>
sized measuring cups.    If asked to add two-thirds cups of sugar to <br/>
a recipe, she will be frustrated because there is no two thirds cup <br/>
in our collection.   She doesn&#39;t understand that you could fill the <br/>
one-third cup twice.     This is after cooking with me daily for <br/>
years.    She can&#39;t figure fractions using pies or pizzas.   She has <br/>
not been able to prepare meals for herself that require mixing <br/>
ingredients that need any degree of measuring.    She was mixing a <br/>
box of brownie mix the other day that called for two tablespoons of <br/>
oil, and she didn&#39;t know how much that was.   I handed her the set <br/>
of measuring spoons, and that was no help because there isn&#39;t one <br/>
specifically labeled two tablespoons.    We&#39;ve been mixing these <br/>
brownies for years.  Virtually every two weeks I&#39;ll explain that we <br/>
fill the tablespoon two times.   She cannot figure out how to double <br/>
a recipe, even though she will be at my side while I do this and I <br/>
talk through the process.<br/>
<br/>
There are six of us at the table routinely, but our older kids join <br/>
us fairly often.    If I tell her that her older brother and his <br/>
wife will be coming and ask her to set extra places, she doesn&#39;t <br/>
know how many places to set.   But she can add six and two.   <br/>
<br/>
Let me add, I&#39;m not making any of these activities &quot;educational.&quot;  <br/>
Board and card games are routine around here.   But she needs our <br/>
help to participate, just as we would have helped one of the kids <br/>
when they were five or six year olds, just learning a game. <br/>
<br/>
She doesn&#39;t understand the concepts of before and after.   Recently <br/>
her ballet teacher asked her to come an hour early for a costume <br/>
fitting, and she didn&#39;t have a clue as to what time that would be.   <br/>
If a movie starts at six and lasts two hours, she won&#39;t know when it <br/>
is over.   She can read a digital clock, but she can&#39;t connect how <br/>
many minutes it will be until something starts.    If we plan to <br/>
leave the house at 3:15, and it&#39;s 2:45, she won&#39;t know how lont it <br/>
is until we leave.    <br/>
<br/>
She can&#39;t read a thermometer.  She can&#39;t use a calendar to see how <br/>
many days it will be until an event.    She doesn&#39;t know how to <br/>
figure the number of days when going from, oh, let&#39;s say the 25&#39;th <br/>
of one month to the 3rd of the next, even with a calendar in front <br/>
of her.    Recently she asked when her next hair appointment was, <br/>
and I said that I had written it on the calendar, and she had no <br/>
idea that if it wasn&#39;t on the current page that it might be on the <br/>
next.   She didn&#39;t see an appointment written in October, and she <br/>
had no concept of looking at November.   We&#39;re going to Florida in <br/>
January and she doesn&#39;t know if that is before or after Christmas.<br/>
<br/>
She seeks out age appropriate books, but she has never been able to <br/>
talk about the content.   She can&#39;t participate in real <br/>
conversations with people, so she does lots of diversional tactics <br/>
like saying things that she knows are silly. <br/>
<br/>
She loves computer games that are totally visual, but can&#39;t move <br/>
beyond to any that require strategic thinking.    And she can&#39;t play <br/>
basic board games that require any strategy.  She likes movies and <br/>
tv but can&#39;t participate in any family discussion on what is going <br/>
on.    We will make predictions as to what we think might happen in <br/>
an ongoing series, and she clearly doesn&#39;t follow.<br/>
<br/>
Her speech and language issues are similar to those you would expect <br/>
with an adult who had suffered a stroke.    Every professional she <br/>
has encountered believe she has suffered some type of brain injury, <br/>
either before or after birth.   <br/>
<br/>
The reason I&#39;m raising all this is that I&#39;m not sure about what <br/>
parents of children with severe developmental disabilities do with <br/>
respect to unschooling.   While I have confidence that the other <br/>
girls learn a great deal from normal family activities, I&#39;m not <br/>
confident that this particular chid is able to function at that <br/>
level.    So, my question is, would you recommend unschooling for a <br/>
child who has a significant developmental disability?    Anyone who <br/>
spends time with my daughter knows that there is a major problem, <br/>
but we don&#39;t have a diagnosis.     We know that she will likely <br/>
never be able to live independently, although our hope is that she <br/>
will be able to have a job outside a &quot;sheltered work environment.&quot;  <br/>
We have been advised to provide a financial plan with guardians for <br/>
her inheritance.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have any confidence that anything I&#39;ve done so far has <br/>
helped much.   I moved away from anything approaching formal work <br/>
with her a long time ago, because it was so frustrating for her.  I <br/>
try to keep things as low key, non-threatening as possible because I <br/>
want to keep pressure off out of concern for her self image, which <br/>
has already been damaged pretty badly because of the abuse she faced <br/>
in the orphanage.   <br/>
<br/>
I probably am coming off as defensive, and I probably am, because <br/>
people keep telling me what works with their kids who have ADD or <br/>
dyslexia or are autistic, and none of these apply to a child who <br/>
possibly has brain damage and a signifant developmental disability.  <br/>
A friend whose child has Downs told me it&#39;s actually easier in some <br/>
ways for her because her child&#39;s disability is visual.   Our <br/>
daughter has something going on in her brain that is very real, but <br/>
we can&#39;t diagnose it or find a particular therapy to use.<br/>

I&#39;m writing as listowner this time.<br/>
<br/>
Because Word on my Mac will do a word count, I put your post in there.<br/>
<br/>
1,423 words.  Not about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Thank you for the responses, and especially the direction to a<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You should have looked at the links immediately.  People here are  <br/>
trying to help you with what you said you wanted help with.  The  <br/>
purpose of the list is to discuss unschooling.  We can do that, we  <br/>
will do that, we&#39;ve been doing that for seven years.  The good parts  <br/>
are saved, and you were sent links.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To say &quot;yeah, yeah, I&#39;ll read your stuff later,&quot; but then to expect  <br/>
over 1000 people to read over 1000 words is not a good use of  <br/>
anyone&#39;s time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure some people will read every word you wrote, because they&#39;re  <br/>
generous with their time.  I glanced through, but I&#39;m tired and am  <br/>
going to sleep.  What I can say is that if your daughter can&#39;t direct  <br/>
people to their seats, she shouldn&#39;t have been put in a position to  <br/>
fail.  She could&#39;ve handed out programs.  I&#39;ve ushered at an opera.   <br/>
There are other jobs than directing people to seats.<br/>
<br/>
If you had an adult houseguest who had had a stroke, or you were  <br/>
taking care of a parent who had brain damage, you wouldn&#39;t expect  <br/>
them to measure ingredients or set the table.<br/>
<br/>
It seems many of your problems might be from your pressing her to do  <br/>
what she can&#39;t do, instead of helping her do things more directly, as  <br/>
you would with a younger child or a guest.<br/>

for her to play with.  I&#39;m not thinking of any off the top of my head,<br/>
but I&#39;m sure they&#39;re out there.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m curious about her interest in dance.  My own experience with dance,<br/>
is that there is strategy involved.  There are certain ways to move and<br/>
hold yourself that work better than other ways.  Doing movement across a<br/>
floor and finishing before you run into a wall is strategy.  Doing<br/>
choreography to counts is mathematical.  Ballet is very geometric, it&#39;s<br/>
the very nature of it&#39;s design.  Diagonals, circles, left, right,<br/>
center, squares, up, and down, it&#39;s very very ordered and symmetrical. <br/>
Even excercises are ordered and symmetrical in nature, everything is<br/>
done on the right side, directly followed by the left side.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There is no difference.  Each person will learn what they learn and live<br/>
accordingly.  She may not ever be independent, but she could be happily<br/>
doing things she loves to do and feeling good about herself and life.<br/>
<br/>
Focus on what she does like and enjoy, and do more of it.  Do that with<br/>
each of your kids.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1803010466">I read your post and I get your point that your daughter significantly<br/>
delayed. IMO, Unschooling would be perfect for her.  One can only build on<br/>
the knowledge and abilities they already have.  You sound like you have an<br/>
active busy family.  She will continue to learn and grow as you help her<br/>
follow her interests and participate in your family life.  I would just<br/>
remind you to actively search for things that she finds interesting and fun.<br/>
(video games, etc)  When I get stressed about something I feel like I SHOULD<br/>
be doing, I always go back in my own head to the thought:  If my child died<br/>
today, would I be happy with the last moments I spent with her.  What can I<br/>
do to make her life peaceful and happy? <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I believe unschooling is possible for any child with disability. <br/>
<br/>
Because it freedom, allowing you to accomodate the child&#39;s unique <br/>
abilities, and not highlight and try to fix thier disabilities.<br/>
<br/>
Me and hubby do not see son&#39;s asperger as a disabilty. We just see it <br/>
as he is a totally different type of human being, just on a different <br/>
frequency compare to ours. <br/>
<br/>
This was evidence when we recently had to filled up a form for him. <br/>
Alot of his behaviour was classified as a disability, which to us, was <br/>
both amazingly funny and surprising. Because we never did see it that <br/>
way. <br/>
<br/>
The fact that he is now socialising well with another asperger child, <br/>
tells me that they can communicate well, as long as they are on the <br/>
same wave lenght.   <br/>
<br/>
I am unschooling an asperger child with atypical traits, meaning he <br/>
does have other so called &quot;limiting&quot; behaviour that&#39;s not noted on the <br/>
great big asperger book. <br/>
<br/>
To me, limitation is only evident when measured against someone else&#39;s <br/>
expectation. <br/>
<br/>
When you do not apply any of your expectation on the child, then the <br/>
child&#39;s limitation no longer exist. What you have is the true essence <br/>
of the child showing, the true beauty and ability of that individual. <br/>
<br/>
I unschool my son according to his character and ability. My child <br/>
does not understand limitation because of his narrow obssesion, which <br/>
is a very common asperger trait. <br/>
<br/>
But yet I have learn to unschool by accepting his obsession, and not <br/>
limit it. I just let him get on with it and let it naturally exhaust <br/>
itself. And this obsession behaviour has led to many great <br/>
discoveries, of his own doing, contributing to great sense of <br/>
achievements. His current obsession is fire burning, so he&#39;s getting <br/>
on with it, burning lots of different things in the back garden in the <br/>
past 2 months or so.<br/>
<br/>
So perhaps you need to unschool your expectations of her first? And <br/>
just accept her for what she is? And focus on her abilities, and work <br/>
creatively to bridge that limitations of hers? Just because she cannot <br/>
count money, doesn;&#39;t mean her life is gonna be any lesser, is it? <br/>
<br/>
It just means she&#39;ll have to handle money in a different method, <br/>
possibly. Maybe notes and coins doesn&#39;t makes sense to her brain. You <br/>
know how we always say that it is possible for all those great <br/>
scientist to know fantastically confusing physic formula, but yet <br/>
cannot change a diaper? Here&#39;s something for you to think about LOL!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1666468064">You mentioned her reading (but not really seeming to understand it)<br/>
and also that she is very visual... it made me wonder if she would<br/>
like reading manga.  Books with a lot of pictures might be more<br/>
enjoyable for her and easier to make the story real.  It sounded as<br/>
though you were saying that she can read.  If she is very visual, I<br/>
think books with pictures and movies might be a better direction to go<br/>
than books on tape.  Books on tape might be harder.  Offering them and<br/>
seeing what she likes is probably the best way to find out, though.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to try manga, &quot;Fruits Basket&quot; might be a nice one to start<br/>
with.   There is also an anime version that she might enjoy.  Ranma is<br/>
also a lot of fun - rather silly and a lot of physical humor (anime<br/>
and manga for this one as well).   Comics like Garfield might be<br/>
enjoyable as well.<br/>
<br/>
I also wondered if she is choosing age appropriate books because she<br/>
feels as though she should.  Maybe you could encourage her to look at<br/>
other things that are easier to read.  Fairy tales with lots of<br/>
pictures might be enjoyable for her.  They are simpler and more visual<br/>
without seeming childish.  I read books illustrated by Susan Jeffers<br/>
when I was younger and they are nice versions of the stories.  Perhaps<br/>
you could find other picture books that can be fun for adults too -<br/>
share them with the whole family.  Perhaps if she sees her sisters and<br/>
you reading things like that it will seem OK for her to do it too.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the Miyazaki movies might be fun and adults like them too.<br/>
&quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot;, &quot;Kiki&#39;s Delivery service&quot; and &quot;Spirited Away&quot;<br/>
are the ones my daughter loves (she is 5) and I do as well.  The first<br/>
two have fairly simple plots.  All of them are very interesting,<br/>
visually.<br/>
<br/>
It sounded as though she enjoys dance.  What else does she enjoy<br/>
doing?  What kind of video games does she enjoy?<br/>

&gt; I would like to add to the situation we are in with our 15 year old,<br/>
&gt; because I&#39;m not sure but what we may be talking at cross purposes.<br/>
&gt; I mentioned her IQ, not because I put faith in this score, but<br/>
&gt; because it is one part of the effort we&#39;ve been making to figure out<br/>
&gt; what is going on. I have no clue what my other seven children&#39;s IQ<br/>
&gt; scores are, or mine, or my husband&#39;s. It would never, never occur<br/>
&gt; to me to even consider testing one of the other children. But<br/>
&gt; this child is struggling in ways I&#39;ve never encountered. We have<br/>
&gt; no medical history of her before we adopted her when she was six.<br/>
&gt; We have no information as to what she might have been exposed to in<br/>
&gt; utero. We do know, however, that something is clearly limiting her<br/>
&gt; abilities.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sandra asked if she has access to using money. Of course. She<br/>
&gt; gets an allowance and is expected to pay for certain expenses, such<br/>
&gt; as going to movies, buying gifts for friends, buying snacks and much<br/>
&gt; more. We play board games routinely. She helps me in the kitchen<br/>
&gt; with preparing meals that involve the use of recipes in cookbooks.<br/>
&gt; She has a digital watch, digital alarm clock, calendars, appointment<br/>
&gt; books. There are areas in which she hasn&#39;t been able to make<br/>
&gt; connections that I would think would be fairly normal for a fifteen<br/>
&gt; year old.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For example, she can&#39;t count the money in her wallet. She doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; know if she has enough money to make a purchase. If she has two<br/>
&gt; tens, three fives, and seven ones, plus change, she won&#39;t know if<br/>
&gt; she can buy something that costs $12 because there is no $12<br/>
&gt; bill. When counting coins, if she has three quarters and three<br/>
&gt; dimes, she can&#39;t figure out how much that is. I have tried to help<br/>
&gt; her make these connections in as many ways as I know.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; She cannot keep days of the week straight from months of the year.<br/>
&gt; She can&#39;t name all the months and she doesn&#39;t know what month<br/>
&gt; Christmas occurs in. She can&#39;t get the connection as to what<br/>
&gt; month comes after December. We use calendars all the time, trying<br/>
&gt; to present ideas that much younger children are typically absorbing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Recently she was helping as an usher at a ballet performance for an<br/>
&gt; out-of-town touring company. She couldn&#39;t direct people to their<br/>
&gt; seats because she doesn&#39;t know the alphabet well enough to recognize<br/>
&gt; where the different letters will fall in the rows at the theatre.<br/>
&gt; She literally was taking people to the front of the auditorium, then<br/>
&gt; advancing up the stairs until she got to the correct row.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When helping me cook, she can&#39;t differentiate between the different<br/>
&gt; sized measuring cups. If asked to add two-thirds cups of sugar to<br/>
&gt; a recipe, she will be frustrated because there is no two thirds cup<br/>
&gt; in our collection. She doesn&#39;t understand that you could fill the<br/>
&gt; one-third cup twice. This is after cooking with me daily for<br/>
&gt; years. She can&#39;t figure fractions using pies or pizzas. She has<br/>
&gt; not been able to prepare meals for herself that require mixing<br/>
&gt; ingredients that need any degree of measuring. She was mixing a<br/>
&gt; box of brownie mix the other day that called for two tablespoons of<br/>
&gt; oil, and she didn&#39;t know how much that was. I handed her the set<br/>
&gt; of measuring spoons, and that was no help because there isn&#39;t one<br/>
&gt; specifically labeled two tablespoons. We&#39;ve been mixing these<br/>
&gt; brownies for years. Virtually every two weeks I&#39;ll explain that we<br/>
&gt; fill the tablespoon two times. She cannot figure out how to double<br/>
&gt; a recipe, even though she will be at my side while I do this and I<br/>
&gt; talk through the process.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are six of us at the table routinely, but our older kids join<br/>
&gt; us fairly often. If I tell her that her older brother and his<br/>
&gt; wife will be coming and ask her to set extra places, she doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; know how many places to set. But she can add six and two.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Let me add, I&#39;m not making any of these activities &quot;educational.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Board and card games are routine around here. But she needs our<br/>
&gt; help to participate, just as we would have helped one of the kids<br/>
&gt; when they were five or six year olds, just learning a game.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; She doesn&#39;t understand the concepts of before and after. Recently<br/>
&gt; her ballet teacher asked her to come an hour early for a costume<br/>
&gt; fitting, and she didn&#39;t have a clue as to what time that would be.<br/>
&gt; If a movie starts at six and lasts two hours, she won&#39;t know when it<br/>
&gt; is over. She can read a digital clock, but she can&#39;t connect how<br/>
&gt; many minutes it will be until something starts. If we plan to<br/>
&gt; leave the house at 3:15, and it&#39;s 2:45, she won&#39;t know how lont it<br/>
&gt; is until we leave.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; She can&#39;t read a thermometer. She can&#39;t use a calendar to see how<br/>
&gt; many days it will be until an event. She doesn&#39;t know how to<br/>
&gt; figure the number of days when going from, oh, let&#39;s say the 25&#39;th<br/>
&gt; of one month to the 3rd of the next, even with a calendar in front<br/>
&gt; of her. Recently she asked when her next hair appointment was,<br/>
&gt; and I said that I had written it on the calendar, and she had no<br/>
&gt; idea that if it wasn&#39;t on the current page that it might be on the<br/>
&gt; next. She didn&#39;t see an appointment written in October, and she<br/>
&gt; had no concept of looking at November. We&#39;re going to Florida in<br/>
&gt; January and she doesn&#39;t know if that is before or after Christmas.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; She seeks out age appropriate books, but she has never been able to<br/>
&gt; talk about the content. She can&#39;t participate in real<br/>
&gt; conversations with people, so she does lots of diversional tactics<br/>
&gt; like saying things that she knows are silly.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; She loves computer games that are totally visual, but can&#39;t move<br/>
&gt; beyond to any that require strategic thinking. And she can&#39;t play<br/>
&gt; basic board games that require any strategy. She likes movies and<br/>
&gt; tv but can&#39;t participate in any family discussion on what is going<br/>
&gt; on. We will make predictions as to what we think might happen in<br/>
&gt; an ongoing series, and she clearly doesn&#39;t follow.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Her speech and language issues are similar to those you would expect<br/>
&gt; with an adult who had suffered a stroke. Every professional she<br/>
&gt; has encountered believe she has suffered some type of brain injury,<br/>
&gt; either before or after birth.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The reason I&#39;m raising all this is that I&#39;m not sure about what<br/>
&gt; parents of children with severe developmental disabilities do with<br/>
&gt; respect to unschooling. While I have confidence that the other<br/>
&gt; girls learn a great deal from normal family activities, I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt; confident that this particular chid is able to function at that<br/>
&gt; level. So, my question is, would you recommend unschooling for a<br/>
&gt; child who has a significant developmental disability? Anyone who<br/>
&gt; spends time with my daughter knows that there is a major problem,<br/>
&gt; but we don&#39;t have a diagnosis. We know that she will likely<br/>
&gt; never be able to live independently, although our hope is that she<br/>
&gt; will be able to have a job outside a &quot;sheltered work environment.&quot;<br/>
&gt; We have been advised to provide a financial plan with guardians for<br/>
&gt; her inheritance.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t have any confidence that anything I&#39;ve done so far has<br/>
&gt; helped much. I moved away from anything approaching formal work<br/>
&gt; with her a long time ago, because it was so frustrating for her. I<br/>
&gt; try to keep things as low key, non-threatening as possible because I<br/>
&gt; want to keep pressure off out of concern for her self image, which<br/>
&gt; has already been damaged pretty badly because of the abuse she faced<br/>
&gt; in the orphanage.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I probably am coming off as defensive, and I probably am, because<br/>
&gt; people keep telling me what works with their kids who have ADD or<br/>
&gt; dyslexia or are autistic, and none of these apply to a child who<br/>
&gt; possibly has brain damage and a signifant developmental disability.<br/>
&gt; A friend whose child has Downs told me it&#39;s actually easier in some<br/>
&gt; ways for her because her child&#39;s disability is visual. Our<br/>
&gt; daughter has something going on in her brain that is very real, but<br/>
&gt; we can&#39;t diagnose it or find a particular therapy to use.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1220894454">I think the idea of expectations and releasing them is something that would <br/>
help you with all your children.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe as a useful exercise take every negative expectation that you have <br/>
written about in your couple of posts - including the subtle ones, the &quot;they <br/>
won&#39;t&quot;, &quot;they can&#39;t&quot;, &quot;they never&quot; phrases - and turn them around into <br/>
something positive. This will start you on the path of seeing your children <br/>
as perfect in the now. Then let those happy perceptions flutter off into the <br/>
ether like butterflies in the garden, and let go of ALL the expectations - <br/>
good or bad.<br/>
<br/>
For example:<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;She gets an allowance and is expected to pay for certain expenses, such<br/>
as going to movies, buying gifts for friends, buying snacks and much <br/>
more.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How about &quot;She gets an allowance and is able to use it to pay for certain <br/>
expenses which I can help her with&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Being unable to count money could become about her generosity in wanting to <br/>
buy gifts for her friends.<br/>
<br/>
Here is something that struck me as you choosing to focus on the negative <br/>
instead of choosing to celebrate the positive.<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;She couldn&#39;t direct people to their<br/>
 seats because she doesn&#39;t know the alphabet well enough to recognize<br/>
 where the different letters will fall in the rows at the theatre.<br/>
 She literally was taking people to the front of the auditorium, then<br/>
 advancing up the stairs until she got to the correct row. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
She was placed in a position of not being able to complete a task in the <br/>
usual way - so she devised a method for doing it that worked perfectly well!<br/>
<br/>
She found a way to be successful, but all you are talking of are her <br/>
inabilities.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s write it again with positivity:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m so proud of her because when she found she couldn&#39;t keep the letters <br/>
straight, she worked out that she could follow the row letters by starting <br/>
at the front and working back to show people to their seats.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Just celebrate moments - the happy moment the brownies come out of the <br/>
oven - even if it is the same one over and over.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;We know that she will likely<br/>
 never be able to live independently, although our hope is that she<br/>
 will be able to have a job outside a &quot;sheltered work environment.&quot;<br/>
 We have been advised to provide a financial plan with guardians for<br/>
 her inheritance.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why do you hope for her to be outside of a &quot;sheltered work environment&quot;? <br/>
Always wanting more than she can give? I think I would be hoping that she <br/>
would always *have* a place in a sheltered environment.<br/>
<br/>
Having a financial plan sounds good!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t have any confidence that anything I&#39;ve done so far has helped <br/>
much.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think you should give yourself credit for bringing her into a loving home <br/>
from an orphanage, and for having the patience to work with her. Now direct <br/>
that patience a little differently to *being* with her, joyfully, in what <br/>
may be an endless loop of never doubling the brownie recipe. But she will <br/>
still feel your love and acceptance.<br/>
<br/>
Now, to move forward with unschooling it might be time to look at what <br/>
&quot;helped much&quot; means. I think you have goals that are about making her be <br/>
&quot;normal&quot; or give the appearance of normal to the outside world. I think you <br/>
are trying to push her to be all she can be, instead of doing what <br/>
unschoolers do, which is appreciate where are children are now, who they are <br/>
now. This frees our children to become all they can be - at their own pace <br/>
and time.<br/>
<br/>
This works with your other children also. Cease looking at what they aren&#39;t <br/>
doing (yet), and focus on what they can do, do enjoy, are interested in.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1466363171">I was thinking about doubling the brownie recipe, and I wonder if it<br/>
would be happier for all of you if you just said &quot;We&#39;ll need two<br/>

your dinner example, &quot;We have two guests coming so we will need 8<br/>

That&#39;s a good idea Sandra, will strew that to DS. At the moment, he&#39;s <br/>
into generating the most smoke he can, hence burning different things <br/>
in different container. I could see this can possible lead to smoke <br/>
signals. <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s even enlist his best friend into it, so I&#39;m having 2 aspie kids, <br/>
burning stuff every afternoon at the back garden LOL!!<br/>
<br/>
It is interesting to watch them tho, because they seems very &quot;ready <br/>
and prepared&quot; to stamp out any burning that&#39;s getting too big to <br/>
control. This tells me that they are aware of the danger of fire <br/>
getting out of control. <br/>
<br/>
Today DS dug out my hoard of flatten toys, carton and cereal boxes (i <br/>
knew this will come handy one day LOL!) and got arty with it. He made <br/>
a variety of things to be burnt. He even built a big &quot;picnic table of <br/>
death, complete with a 3D apple, a magazine and a bag of crisp&quot;, all <br/>
out of cellotape and paper and the vacumm cleaner box. <br/>

Hi Robin,<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s interesting you said this, because when I was replying <br/>
yesterday, it did cross my mind if he is somehow exorcising his old <br/>
fear of the fire. <br/>
<br/>
My kid used to panic when he hears a siren of somesort, or <br/>
everywhere we went he&#39;ll be busy trying to spot that red fire <br/>
alarm.  We eventually linked it back to the fire alarm drills thay <br/>
do at playschool. Ever since then,  that fear stuck with him for <br/>
many years. Those were the days whereby he absolutely will not stay <br/>
once he spots the fire alarm. It actually got worse whereby if he <br/>
doesn&#39;t see it, he thinks it&#39;s hidden somewhere, and will still <br/>
insist on going home. <br/>
<br/>
During our unschooling, we stayed home pretty much or if we do go <br/>
out, it is mostly to the park, I guessed he finally forgotten about <br/>
that fear, plus he is alittle bit older now, so he understands <br/>
better the meaning of sirens and fire alarms. With everything going <br/>
so well, I kinda forgot about his fear LOL!!    <br/>
<br/>
This now reminds me of something I&#39;ve read a long time ago, about <br/>
allowing the child to work thru thier fears by touching the object <br/>
of fear, talkabout it or playing with it. It is when we remove the <br/>
object of fear that&#39;s when the fear will be stuck as such, forever. <br/>
<br/>
Yes, I can see now it may be deeper than just some science <br/>
experiments. So there we go, another example of unschooling working <br/>
it&#39;s magic. <br/>
<br/>
And all those talk about smoking food is getting ME really excited. <br/>
Hmmm...not into smoke meat but I&#39;m gonna get some cheese and get the <br/>
kids to smoke it, for my snack LOL! Mind you, the boys did get one <br/>
of the neighbours started on thier bbq because I chargrilled food <br/>
LOL!! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-827090963">-=-This seems like a sense of deja vu. I thought a few weeks ago, we did<br/>
had someone posted similar dilemma, also dealing with an adopted<br/>
daughter, now 15, with similar issues? -=-<br/>
<br/>
Two or three people join every day, generally.  Sometimes more.   <br/>
There are people with kids in school this week who will take them out  <br/>
next week.   The same kinds of discussions come around regularly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s okay to bring links to other discussions (if you want to search  <br/>
the archives and expose older threads for newer discussion that&#39;s fine).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-I believe unschooling is possible for any child with disability.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Because it freedom, allowing you to accomodate the child&#39;s unique<br/>
abilities, and not highlight and try to fix thier disabilities.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s good not to even talk about &quot;disabilities&quot; when it can  <br/>
be avoided.<br/>
<br/>
Each child can only learn at his own pace, no matter how much he  <br/>
might be in a learning spurt or downturn, or what particular  <br/>
intelligences he has in abundance, or might be somewhat lacking.<br/>
<br/>
People are different.  Unschooling has always seemed ideal, to me,  <br/>
for kids of ANY sort, but that&#39;s assuming the mother can get it.  The  <br/>
mother needs to change, and that&#39;s the hardest part.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
YES, unschooling would be great for a child who is for whatever  <br/>
reasons &quot;behind the curve&quot; in some area, but the parent can&#39;t just  <br/>
utter the word &quot;unschooling&quot; and expect the child to change and start  <br/>
learning all kinds of cool things on her own.  The parents will need  <br/>
to become unschooling parents.<br/>
<br/>
-=-To me, limitation is only evident when measured against someone  <br/>
else&#39;s expectation. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Yes, and that&#39;s why one of the first things to let go of when people  <br/>
come to unschooling should be labelling and comparisons, insofar as  <br/>
they can move from seeing their child as one mark on a large graph to  <br/>
being a whole, big human being whose life has been being lived and is  <br/>
being lived and will continue to be lived, and the parents become  <br/>
facilitators for improvements on the quality of that life!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1371000496">&quot;...to move forward with unschooling it might be time to look at what<br/>
&quot;helped much&quot; means. I think you have goals that are about making her<br/>
be &quot;normal&quot; or give the appearance of normal to the outside world.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This conversation struck a chord with me, as I came from a similar<br/>
spot.  I had to first de-school myself from this perspective before I<br/>
could go ahead and tackle the rest of my unschooling journey.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately trying to produce the appearance of &quot;normal&quot; is exactly<br/>
what it is all about when you are seeking help for your child from the<br/>
school, health authorities or whomever.  And when you&#39;ve spent years<br/>
and years all your time and energy fighting for &quot;help&quot; for your child,<br/>
it&#39;s very easy to get stuck in that fear that you will be quitting on<br/>
them or letting them down when you let this go.<br/>

&gt; connections that I would think would be fairly normal for a fifteen<br/>
&gt; year old<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think the conventional model would suggest that it&#39;s a parent or teacher&#39;s<br/>
responsibility to be ever vigilant, notice where connections aren&#39;t being<br/>
made, and take action. The assumption is that with the proper action, the<br/>
connection will follow.  Which might be true if a child&#39;s mind were more<br/>
like some sort of machine in terms of cause and effect, but which tends to<br/>
produce frustration when dealing with actual, marvelously complex, human<br/>
beings.  When the connections don&#39;t happen, is that the fault of the<br/>
&quot;teacher&quot; or the &quot;student&quot;?  Does it have to be someone&#39;s fault? Could we<br/>
ever really know what kind of connections are happening in another person&#39;s<br/>
mind?   As an unschooler I want to try, as Robyn said in another post<br/>
yesterday, to &quot;appreciate where are children are now, who they are now,&quot;<br/>
instead of constantly looking for what connections are missing and how to<br/>
create them.  It doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t be aware of (and even thrilled by)<br/>
connections as they happen, it doesn&#39;t mean we stop living interesting busy<br/>
lives full of opportunities for connections, but do you think I&#39;m accurate,<br/>
fellow unschoolers, in saying that it does mean that we stop seeing<br/>
ourselves as the catalyst? So that it stops being about what either the<br/>
learner or the adult have done &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot;?  I confess that I still<br/>
often struggle with worrying that maybe I haven&#39;t done enough, that maybe I<br/>
should be trying harder to help my three kids &quot;progress&quot;.  But it&#39;s<br/>
something I&#39;m fighting against, because I see a big difference in our life<br/>
when I am able to live from a place of joy instead of a place of fear.  I<br/>
don&#39;t want credit OR the blame for their connections, I just want happy full<br/>
lives for everybody.<br/>

neighbor with a child suffering in this way, and everytime we talked<br/>
about it, it always came back to this, &quot;what are the means to what<br/>
end?&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I think it really helps to see yourself and your child running towards<br/>
this other really awesome way of living, one focused on joy and<br/>
happiness and living in the moment, instead of running away from that<br/>
other school way of living that wasn&#39;t working.  It&#39;s ok to keep in mind<br/>
what you know doesn&#39;t work, but the focus should be on what does.</div>

This is true, and not everyone can unschool.  Not everyone who wants  <br/>
to can, and not everyone who could do it easily and well wants to!<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think that&#39;s fair to say.<br/>
<br/>
Some families are neglectful; some parents are ignorant, mean,  <br/>
abusive, alcoholic druggies.  Sometimes just having seven hours away  <br/>
from a bad home is a world of help.<br/>
<br/>
If a child is deaf or blind or has a serious speech impediment  and  <br/>
the parents didn&#39;t even have the wherewithal to nurture a  fully- <br/>
functional talking, singing whiz kid, what the schools do to help  <br/>
those kids might be the only help they&#39;ve ever had.<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine taught pre-school for the deaf for many years.  She  <br/>
taught high school at the state school for the deaf before that.  She  <br/>
has told me stories of kids  (MANY dozens of families over the years)  <br/>
whose parents never learned to sign.  They weren&#39;t interested.  They  <br/>
just sent their kids to school and then endured the days they were at  <br/>
home, but didn&#39;t try to learn to communicate with them.<br/>
<br/>
When you make a statement, try (please) not to make it as though  <br/>
every family is an ideal unschooling family.   Very few are.<br/>

I think that because of unschooling (and some other related ideas)  <br/>
there ARE better parents, so thanks for all your help (and others  <br/>
here, but Jen&#39;s written lots) helping other parents!<br/>

She can&#39;t name all the months and she doesn&#39;t know what month<br/>
Christmas occurs in. She can&#39;t get the connection as to what<br/>
month comes after December. We use calendars all the time, trying<br/>
to present ideas that much younger children are typically absorbing.-=-<br/>
<br/>
The way my kids learned months was from a song on a tape (now I  <br/>
assume it&#39;s on a CD) called &quot;Sounds Like Fun.&quot;  They learned to count  <br/>
by tens from that, too.<br/>

<br/>
Days of the week in order, and how long a month is (four weeks, and  <br/>
some) they know from me singing the days of the week to Yankee Doodle  <br/>
while I brushed their teeth.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could just sing it in the car.  Nobody  has to &quot;memorize&quot;  <br/>
the alphabet or anything else if they can run through a song in  <br/>
their  head.<br/>
