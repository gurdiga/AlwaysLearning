<div id="ygrps-yiv-729785201">Sometimes this list is very quiet for days.  Sometimes &quot;quiet for days&quot; is <br/>
pretty cool!<br/>
<br/>
But for people really looking for unschooling information, quiet can be <br/>
boring.  So for newer people here, especially if this is your primary <br/>
unschooling source, I&#39;d like to recommend these places if you want more <br/>
lively or more basic  information:<br/>

<h4>Dawn Falbe</h4>
<time>25 Feb 2003, at  6:26pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-873990736">Don&#39;t get me started Heidi (LOL).... Here&#39;s a copy of the letter I send to<br/>
the Editor in response to the article that was posted here earlier and<br/>
appeared in the Arizona Daily Star.  I&#39;m afraid once I say something I don&#39;t<br/>
stop...  but maybe it would be a good idea to say something on that<br/>
unschooling list.<br/>
<br/>
Holding parents to the same standards that apply to public schools,<br/>
especially when it comes to student achievement testing is not logical.  If<br/>
schools are failing to meet &quot;testing guidelines&quot; is there a suggestion that<br/>
we as home-schooling parents lower our children to the level of those that<br/>
go to schools that are failing?  How is that beneficial to our children?<br/>
<br/>
Testing is about proving that teachers are actually working, when in fact if<br/>
the results are so bad why aren&#39;t we firing all these teachers because they<br/>
are obviously not doing their job.  As parents we don&#39;t have to prove<br/>
anything to anyone.  We are not paid to teach our children and they learn<br/>
anyway.  Teachers want to teach but with all the bureaucratic rubbish they<br/>
have to handle and the &quot;problem children&quot; they have to deal with when do<br/>
they find time to teach.	<br/>
<br/>
Schools don&#39;t teach children what they need to know in the &quot;real&quot; world.  In<br/>
the &quot;real&quot; world we need to know how to be in healthy, appropriate<br/>
relationships with people of all ages.  Does school teach that?  No it<br/>
teaches children that it&#39;s important to do what others do, whether that is<br/>
bullying other children verbally or physically or looking down on others who<br/>
are not willing to be in a popularity contest.  It keeps all children of the<br/>
same age together, thereby not allowing children to experience what it&#39;s<br/>
like in the &quot;real&quot; world to have friends of a variety of ages.  Last time I<br/>
checked with my 5 closest friends they ranged in age from 26 - 54 and I&#39;m<br/>
43.  In school I would never have known these people.<br/>
<br/>
When checking with universities such as Harvard and Stanford I have read<br/>
they prefer children who&#39;ve been home-schooled, saying &quot;these kids are so<br/>
much more self directed and pay little to no attention to the peer pressure<br/>
the regularly schooled kids do&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
For many people the &quot;real&quot; world does not consist of 1 brick building<br/>
complex that we spend all day in.  For those of us that have chosen<br/>
self-employment, which is rising by leaps and bounds each year, we spend our<br/>
time moving from house to store to outside to be with our children, to<br/>
museums, to meetings with others.  Very different from how most of us spent<br/>
our childhood.<br/>
<br/>
Whenever I read an article in the Arizona Daily Star about home-schooling,<br/>
religion is invariably mentioned.  What about those of us that home-school<br/>
our children because we don&#39;t want our children to be locked up in a room of<br/>
30 kids all day, being force fed information they may or may not need in<br/>
their lifetime.  What about those of us that believe children, as adults do,<br/>
learn what they want to learn when they want to learn it and are quite<br/>
capable of asking for help when needed.  What about those of us that are<br/>
willing to spend time with our children to help them discover and support<br/>
those subjects they love.  What about those us that want our children to<br/>
grow and learn at their own pace and not be compared to anyone else<br/>
<br/>
Why is it that the Arizona Daily Star has a business expert writing business<br/>
columns, a gardening expert writing gardening information but the person who<br/>
writes articles about home-schooling has neither been home-schooled<br/>
themselves nor home-schools their own children? (Jennifer doesn&#39;t actually<br/>
have any children come to that)  Doesn&#39;t it make more sense to have someone<br/>
who has first hand knowledge of home-schooling write about the issue?  Or,<br/>
is there a fear that the person writing might have more positive ideas and<br/>
thoughts to convey about home-schooling, thereby making parents and others<br/>
question the veracity of the educational system in this country and the<br/>
choices they are making as parents.<br/>
