<div id="ygrps-yiv-1003082681">By e-mail I had questions I would rather answer here.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-= In one of your posts you said that you thought it was evil for<br/>
parents to charge their adult children &quot;rent&quot; or board for remaining<br/>
at home.<br/>
Why?-=-<br/>
<br/>
It penalizes them for growing up, for having a birthday.<br/>
<br/>
Going to kindergarten and first grade is said to teach kids what real  <br/>
life is.<br/>
<br/>
The philosophy and principles behind why you wouldn&#39;t send your kids  <br/>
to school can be applied to other situations.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I agree with you but since that was the way i was raised i need to<br/>
know the &quot;why&quot;.I need to ask why to learn of course since the reason i<br/>
heard for my parents charging me rent was; to teach me what real life<br/>
is like.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
But how does it make those 18 year olds feel?<br/>
And *does* it teach them what real life is like?<br/>
And IS that how real life is, or should be?<br/>
<br/>
-=-I need to ask why to learn -=-<br/>
<br/>
I disagree with this.<br/>
It&#39;s good when people can synthesize their own answers from their own  <br/>
beliefs instead of just repeating or reciting what was said to them.   <br/>
I don&#39;t mind the discussion at all--I think it&#39;s great for the list.<br/>

He can reach shelves I can&#39;t reach.  He&#39;s introduced me to some very  <br/>
nice people, and  to music I might&#39;ve missed, to movies, to humor.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby&#39;s greatest service in our family has been, in recent years, to  <br/>
have the room next to Holly&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
The way our house is laid out, Keith and I sleep very far from  <br/>
Holly.  She&#39;s above Marty and next to Kirby, though, and whether it&#39;s  <br/>
realistic or sensible, that makes me feel better, knowing that Kirby  <br/>
and his array of martial arts weapons he&#39;s trained in are right there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-753711672">-=-It makes me smile to think that my 15 year old son will want to  <br/>
stay home awhile. It might mean he really likes us and likes being  <br/>

and smart enough to know it.-=-<br/>
<br/>
The thinks people will swear &quot;have to happen&quot; with teens seem not to  <br/>
happen when the parents stop doing the things those other people  <br/>
swore they &quot;had to do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Parents will shame kids for wanting to do what their friends are  <br/>
doing, or have privileges their friends have, and they&#39;ll say  <br/>
something like &quot;If your friends jumped off a bridge, would you jump  <br/>
off too?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Oh wait...<br/>
They don&#39;t say things LIKE that; they say that very exact thing.<br/>
<br/>
How many hundreds of thousands of parents have said that?  Is it just  <br/>
in the U.S.?  Are there other similar stock phrases used to shame  <br/>
kids who are going through an absolutely natural phase of wanting to  <br/>
identify with people of their own choosing?<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t it interesting that those parents are doing what their friends  <br/>
do, in keeping their kids &quot;under control&quot; and unbalanced and ashamed  <br/>
and afraid?<br/>
<br/>
Someone I&#39;ve known for 30 years was here recently.  Her younger of  <br/>
two is Kirby&#39;s age.  She raised her kids very much more  <br/>
conservatively than I did, and they suffered through a divorce and  <br/>
all that compromise and one-upmanship of the parents...<br/>
<br/>
I was making cookies.  The oven wasn&#39;t heating up right.  I need a  <br/>
new one.  This one takes forever to light.<br/>
<br/>
I came back in and 1/3 of the raw cookies were gone from the tray. I  <br/>
just laughed.  There were four teens in the house, and my husband,  <br/>
and her...  I just made some more.<br/>
<br/>
My friend said &quot;I decided lately that I&#39;m an adult and if I want to  <br/>
make cookie dough and eat it raw I can.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I laughed and teased her about something, about whether she wasn&#39;t  <br/>
afraid of raw eggs, and that since we won&#39;t sue ourselves for food  <br/>
poisoning we can live dangerously or some such.<br/>
<br/>
What I thought, and am still thinking, is that she probably hasn&#39;t  <br/>
thought about the idea that even kids should be able to make cookie  <br/>
dough and eat it raw if they want to.  She sees it as the privilege  <br/>
of adulthood.<br/>

different than demanding rent.  Perhaps it falls under the &quot;who is in<br/>
charge?&quot;  or &quot;who gets to decide?&quot;  banner.      I might  (and have in the<br/>
past when our finances were very different)  let them know that money is<br/>
tight and provide input on what added expenses are involved with extra<br/>
people around.   More of a &quot;we&#39;re all in this together&quot;.<br/>
I can even remember having house &quot;guests&quot;  where I explained that I was<br/>
thrilled to have visitors but would need them to &quot;chip in&quot;  for added food,<br/>
utilities or that I would lend my car for transportation but  could not<br/>
provide gas or any needed oil changes.<br/>
<br/>
I have even heard of instances where  calling it  &quot;rent&quot;  (from an adult<br/>
child or even an elderly parent moving in with an adult child) was the way<br/>
that the boarder convinced the owner to accept help.     And the help might<br/>
end up being way more than fair market value of a room.   ............<br/>
<br/>
Family transaction, not business transactions, are in my opinion more<br/>
appropriate for family to engage in.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a theoretical argument really.  I simply cannot imagine my <br/>
children knowing we needed financial help and not offering to help.  <br/>
Even now at the age of 5 and 13 they would try to help.  I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
even have to ask, they would just help because helping us, helps them.  <br/>
<br/>
If we fastforward 5 yrs and my oldest is 18, living at home and earning <br/>
money, she would be just as gracious as she always has been.  If we <br/>
were really tight financially and were struggling to put food on the <br/>
table, she would buy food because she wouldn&#39;t want us to go without <br/>
food, herself included.<br/>
<br/>
When you live sharing, that doesn&#39;t go away when a child turns 18.  I <br/>
would even go so far as saying that living this way all along, I could <br/>
garauntee that I wouldn&#39;t even have to ask for help if I needed it, and <br/>
neither would my kids.  I know when my kids need help and I help them <br/>
as needed.  I see my kids doing the same.</div>

be a lot for any budget and on our already tight finances, it&#39;s a major<br/>
blow. The rewards are great for our money, although they&#39;re hard to see when<br/>
the things we&#39;re giving up seem so large and looming. Hayden is 8.5 and we<br/>
had a big talk about our budget the other day; I told him exactly where<br/>
*our* money was going this month and how much we had budgeted for specifics<br/>
(i.e. 4th of July & HP5) and the *essentials* (i.e. World of Warcraft). He<br/>
was much calmer about the cutbacks as soon as I was open about our<br/>
situation. He still wishes we had more opportunities to go out to eat AND<br/>
he&#39;s having a great time cooking with me at home :) Keeping him aware of the<br/>
Real Life phenomenon of finances and budget make for a peaceful *right now*<br/>
for us and makes for an enlightened *future adult* in him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-681057931">Back in Romania I never heard of anyone doing that, I knew it was common here, but not where I`m from. On the other side, there are parents who support their children as long as necesary but they keep reminding them how much they did for them, how hard was for them and so on So  I guess that`s a way to get them out<br/>

<br/>
On a recent episode of Gene Simmon&#39;s Family Jewels (The Osbournes with the  <br/>
KISS basist and his family, basically), their oldest son went on a freshman  <br/>
weekend to college to get a feel for what living on campus might feel like. Dad  <br/>
gave him a limo ride and a credit card to make sure everything was covered, <br/>
and  offered many times for him to call if he needed *anything* or wanted to <br/>
come  home. Mom spent the weekend making a new bedroom for him in the basement, <br/>
so  he&#39;d have a space of his own, complete with a huge, flat screen HDTV, <br/>
enormous  fish tank, an actual arcade-type Dance-Dance Revolution, stereo system, <br/>
etc. in  hopes that it would help convince him to live at home while he went <br/>
to college.  They finished up the show with the kids talking about them being <br/>
the only &quot;kids&quot;  they know who talk nice about their parents and how they love <br/>
to hang out with  them. Mom and Dad talked about how much they love the kids <br/>
and love having  them around the house and would like them to stay home <br/>
&quot;forever&quot;-in a  half-joking way. It was very sweet. I wish there was more of this on  <br/>
t.v.!<br/>

discovered this show and LOVE it!<br/>
<br/>
Gene Simmons is portrayed as a very generous, loving and protective  <br/>
daddy and their mother is very sweet and caring to all of them too.  <br/>
As a couple they seem very much connected to each other and their  <br/>
children.  Lotsa love!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2012020182">It does seem that way from the show, but I saw Gene Simmons on a talk show last year <br/>
and they were talking about positive parenting and negotiating with kids and giving them <br/>
choices and he said something like &quot;I&#39;m in charge in my house and when we go out my <br/>
kids know that they better behave or else&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s an excerpt from an interview with Gene Simmons about &#39;Family Jewels&#39; from this <br/>
site:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.channelguidemag.com/articles/simmons.lasso">http://www.channelguidemag.com/articles/simmons.lasso</a><br/>

Question: &quot;Outside of the marriage issue, what stands out most on the show is your <br/>
relationship with your kids. It seems to be very strong and they seem to be, surprisingly, <br/>
very normal. What&#39;s the most difficult part of balancing your role as a rock star with being <br/>
a dad?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Gene&#39;s Answer: &quot;None. Discipline. The same discipline that will not allow me to get high or <br/>
get drunk or smoke is the same discipline that&#39;s in this house. The only job kids have is to <br/>
do well in school and behave  period. &quot;I&#39;ll protect you, I&#39;ll give my life for you, [but] this <br/>
is not a negotiation.&quot; And what&#39;s happened to parenting in America is just a f***ing insult. <br/>
This idea of  and I&#39;ve heard shrinks talking about this  &quot;let&#39;s sit down and negotiate <br/>
with your child.&quot; Well, first, they never earned the right, and what makes you think that any <br/>
of this is sinking [in]? There&#39;s no qualification for negotiation, and they haven&#39;t earned the <br/>
right to negotiate. No, no, no. Good rules make good neighbors. Mother Nature doesn&#39;t <br/>
really care if you&#39;re young, old, good guy or bad guy. There&#39;s a price: Put your hand in the <br/>
fire, you will get burned  whether you meant it or not. Human beings come up with this <br/>
thing, &quot;I ran you over but I didn&#39;t mean it.&quot; And my point is, &quot;What the f***&#39;s the difference? <br/>
I&#39;ve been run over.&quot; So, I&#39;m a firm believer in discipline. They know about tough love camp <br/>
in the middle of the desert. There&#39;s no hitting here because they know this is serious <br/>
business. And small noes like, &quot;Can I move this dish over here?&quot; &quot;No.&quot; That same no is the <br/>
one that says, &quot;Can I get high?&quot; The word &quot;no&quot; means no. Once. And that&#39;s it  consistency <br/>
and strict rules. And be willing to act up. Don&#39;t bluff. We don&#39;t bluff. I will not bluff. Bluff is <br/>
for wimps. Say or don&#39;t say it, but mean it. Yoda was right: Do or do not do, but do not <br/>
try.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2104208839">If you read the whole interview he actually mentions many times how he is the one who&#39;s <br/>
in charge, here&#39;s a couple more quotes:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In this household, there is a man. This is my house. Most of the rest of you wimps out <br/>
there don&#39;t have the balls to stand up on your own two feet and say, &quot;This is my house. I <br/>
paid for it. I worked for it. It&#39;s mine.&quot; Everybody lives here because I allow it, when it really <br/>
comes down to it. This idea of joint bank accounts and &quot;we&quot; and stuff like that  the <br/>
person who earns the money owns it. When I go and buy a car, the people who sit in it <br/>
don&#39;t say &quot;our car.&quot; I don&#39;t subscribe to that notion. What happened to man? That&#39;s my <br/>
question to all of you wimps out there. What the f*** have you done to yourselves?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Question: &quot;But I&#39;m assuming the urge to protect your daughter won&#39;t go away when she <br/>
turns 18 ...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Answer: &quot;Yeah, but then she&#39;ll have her own say about it. You know, your mom was right <br/>
and your dad was right in the old days: You live under my roof, it&#39;s my rules. It&#39;s a good <br/>
idea. It&#39;s a fine idea. I am paying for the privilege to tell you what to do  what do you <br/>
think of them apples? I&#39;m protecting you and I&#39;m paying for you  my rules. Once you go <br/>
off on your own, I have squat to say. This ain&#39;t India. This isn&#39;t arranged marriages.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Question: &quot;It&#39;s amazing because we see other shows that focus on the family lives of <br/>
famous people, and the kids are just insane ...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Answer: &quot;They&#39;re insane and they misbehave because they&#39;re allowed to, don&#39;t you get it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Answer: &quot;But it goes for the animals, too. You notice the animals don&#39;t bark  because <br/>
they&#39;re not allowed to. Literally, when they hear [a whistle], they immediately hold their <br/>
breath. Because Mother Nature is a good teacher. When you see the alpha male eating <br/>
first, the other ones stay away because [otherwise] they get killed. Good rules, <br/>
repercussions for bad behavior  you&#39;ll get results.  [With pets] you can&#39;t do lovey-<br/>
dovey and you can&#39;t kind of go, &quot;Oh, they&#39;re so cute,&quot; because they will twist you, they&#39;ll <br/>
rule you.  And young people, children, are trying to figure out how to survive in this <br/>
world, which is why they go and they try stuff, trying to figure out who they are. Not here. I <br/>
catch you high once, you&#39;re going to be in the desert in a camp you never knew existed. <br/>
Just once. They know that.&quot;<br/>

always has done: posture for the interviewer. He talks macho, but I don&#39;t know  <br/>
anyone that has the kind of acting skill that would let him get away with a  <br/>
completely different persona for his family. He looks and talks tough, but  <br/>
inside, he&#39;s really just a big softie. Like my DH. ;~)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-744599688">That&#39;s what I was thinking.  I hope that he&#39;s just talking tough for  <br/>
the interviewer or at least, if he really thinks that way that he  <br/>
doesn&#39;t actually act on his thoughts the way he makes out to the  <br/>
interviewer.<br/>
