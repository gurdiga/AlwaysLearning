<div id="ygrps-yiv-1462835950">I just got this on MySpace, from my nephew, Elijah Trujillo, who&#39;s  <br/>
just a few months older than Kirby (21).<br/>
Sipapu is a small ski resort in northern New Mexico.  I don&#39;t know if  <br/>
Elijah was up there snowboarding or visiting friends or what, but  <br/>
this is a cool story.  He didn&#39;t say whether the mom was local or  <br/>
tourist.<br/>

Your book &quot;Moving A Puddle&quot;<br/>
Body:<br/>
I was up at Sipapu the other day talking to one of my friends about  <br/>
learning being inevitable and started telling him about your book.  <br/>
Then a few minutes later, this lady walked up to me and said, &quot;Sorry  <br/>
for eavesdropping but I heard you talking about that book.&quot;  <br/>
Apparently she bought a copy of it and she said its having a huge  <br/>
impact on the way she&#39;s raising her kids. I just thought I&#39;d tell you  <br/>
that your book is having an impact on the planet.<br/>
I have a few friends that are new to parenting and I would like for  <br/>
them to see the book. I was wondering if maybe I could help you sell  <br/>
the book to help spread the message. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>How sweet! It&#39;s so exciting he can see the value of your stories and your<br/>
lifestyle.<br/>
I imagine he&#39;ll be a very different father to his kids (than he experienced)<br/>
thanks to your input :D<br/>
He would be such a great soul to help spread the message! &hearts;<br/>

private school for a year) when he was 15 or so.</div>
