&lt;&lt; It&#39;s super easy to meet people that way and the <br/>
 whining will end because she&#39;ll be too tired or busy.  (sorry, attitude <br/>
 slipped there...) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think that if the child is stressed out over the parental control, the best <br/>
thing that can happen is them being super comforting and stop the controlling.<br/>
If she&#39;s shy, introverted or less gregarious, I don&#39;t think the above is <br/>
necessarily the way to handle it. Help her learn to trust herself again is <br/>
the first step.<br/>

&lt;&lt; It&#39;s got nothing to do really with being extro or intro, but everything to <br/>
 do with being responsible for your own life and not blaming others for what <br/>
 you are or aren&#39;t. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I guess you read something into it that I did not. I didn&#39;t feel she blamed <br/>
her parents for being an introvert.....I read that she was stressed out, <br/>
hated school and blamed her parents for a lot of her stress because of their <br/>
controlling methods.<br/>
Besides, school teaches people to take no responsibility for either the good <br/>
or bad, someone else gets credit for &quot;teaching&quot;  us something or blame us if <br/>
the &quot;teaching&quot; isn&#39;t working.<br/>
If she is blaming others for her own lack of responsibility, don&#39;t you think <br/>
it&#39;s appropriate since the person in question has been in school most of her <br/>
life.<br/>
It is the parent&#39;s fault for being over controlling, it is the schools fault <br/>
for stressing her out.<br/>
What they need is some healing, comfort for the young lady and freedom to <br/>
find herself again so that she CAN truly take responsibility for her own life.<br/>
How can she take responsibility for anything when  control over her decisions <br/>
is not hers?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ah, see, I missed the &#39;controlling methods&#39; part.  Changes most everything, <br/>
du&#39;nt it.  Poor thing.<br/>
I hope she finds a way out that suits her or that her dad gets so busy and <br/>
tired that he forgets to control her much!<br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;s old enough and really wants to, she could emancipate herself and <br/>
find her own way through life.  I think she&#39;d need to be 17, tho I&#39;m not <br/>
sure about that.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>
Heidi (who was the first child of a very controlling father but &#39;escaped&#39; <br/>
at age 16 and now we get along fine so long as we don&#39;t talk politics or <br/>
religion which means we have a lot of companionable silence.)</div>
