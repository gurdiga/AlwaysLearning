<div id="ygrps-yiv-332617639">Thanks everybody for reminding me that all kids are different, and for lots<br/>
of stories about your families.  It was also pointed out to me yesterday, it<br/>
hasn&#39;t exactly been an unstressful time around here, either, with my dh<br/>
getting ready to leave for the Middle East.  Tim will talk to people when<br/>
he&#39;s ready, I&#39;m sure.<br/>
