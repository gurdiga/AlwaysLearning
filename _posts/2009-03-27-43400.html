<div id="ygrps-yiv-1665904418">I&#39;m working on the local/regional/international links today, and found  <br/>
a line in something from India:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Can education become person and ecological centered instead of just  <br/>
economic centered?<br/>
<br/>
Of the several angles from which unschooling can be seen, I think one  <br/>
that disturbs people without their even knowing it is the idea that  <br/>
some of us might not be caring as much about economics as about  <br/>
personal growth.  It&#39;s about being a whole person rather than aiming  <br/>
to be a wealthy person.<br/>
<br/>
And with the same eye that I see that, I also see people charging  <br/>
other unschoolers $35 an hour or whatever for advice.  Some of those  <br/>
charging are honestly thoughtful and experienced people.  Some just  <br/>
want $35 and don&#39;t really seem to understand unschooling yet themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Money is one of the big stressors of anyone&#39;s emotional life.  Among  <br/>
Christian conservative homeschoolers there were many families in which  <br/>
the dad quit his regular job to create or sell homeschooling  <br/>
materials, and at that point, could the mom try to talk him out of  <br/>
homeschooling?  Much strife was hushed up and covered over about that,  <br/>
and much of the hostility toward unschoolers is economic.  I&#39;ve been  <br/>
winced at and about at conferences at which the fees charged for space  <br/>
in the vendor room provided more revenue than conference fees, and  <br/>
there I was standing at a podium telling people not to buy anything  <br/>
until they understood natural learning--that children could learn from  <br/>
playing with sticks and rocks.   (Not exactly those words, but that  <br/>
general drift, which made vendors desire to criticize me.)<br/>
<br/>
Money isn&#39;t usually discussed, and there have been comments made by  <br/>
people assuming (and being all het up about the idea) that I was  <br/>
making big money, speaking and selling books.  Last year I made $800  <br/>
or so selling books and Thinking Sticks, which I make out of popsicle  <br/>
sticks.  I ended up spending money on the Arizona conference, which  <br/>
was okay because I got to see Kirby and a couple of Sorooshians. &lt;g&gt;    <br/>
The money they gave me for transportation and hotel didn&#39;t totally  <br/>
cover it, but it was fine.   Most often I speak at conferences for  <br/>
airfare and a room.  Some speakers who know less than I know charge  <br/>
$1000 and want a rental car and stuff.  So they&#39;re not thrilled with  <br/>
me taking transportation and a room.  Sometimes I get transportation  <br/>
for one of my kids, as well (as I did to get Kirby to Tempe; then he  <br/>
spoke too, but he wasn&#39;t compensated with his own room, which is also  <br/>
fine).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m telling this because what I&#39;m doing is not about money.  It&#39;s  <br/>
about sharing something that seems magical when it works.  I&#39;m not  <br/>
promoting ways to get rich, or anything except fun and peace and joy  <br/>
and learning.   People who don&#39;t want fun and peace and joy and  <br/>
learning don&#39;t need to hang around where I am.<br/>
<br/>
Will my kids &quot;be rich&quot;?  I don&#39;t know, and I don&#39;t care.  All around  <br/>
me, at every age level, are people who did not meet their parents&#39;  <br/>
expectations.   There&#39;s a depth and breadth of shame, sorrow and  <br/>
broken families involved in that.   The expectations themselves cannot  <br/>
be undone for any amount of money.   I know two adult men whose  <br/>
parents consider them failures.  One is a doctor with several  <br/>
degrees.  One has a PhD.   In both cases, the siblings are medical  <br/>
specialists--surgeons or whatever--and the disappointing sibling is not.<br/>
<br/>
That is what I do not want for my children.  I don&#39;t want to set them  <br/>
up to feel that they could be a doctor or have a PhD and still be a  <br/>
big disappointment to their parents.<br/>
<br/>
Some people look at that and see only &quot;low expectations,&quot; or &quot;lowering  <br/>
the bar.&quot;<br/>
My kids are already doing things adults around them can&#39;t or don&#39;t  <br/>
do.  I&#39;m not worried at all.  They are whole and thoughtful.  Neither  <br/>
of those two things comes from a curriculum in ANY school.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1721576422">Rosie and I both just got done reading &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie.&quot; She wrote <br/>
a paper on it for a political science class and we talked about it a <br/>
fair amount. So &quot;what is important in life&quot; has been our topic of <br/>
conversation for a few days.<br/>
<br/>
It worries my husband that my kids and I aren&#39;t focused on them getting <br/>
degrees that will get them high-paying jobs. He&#39;d like to have a doctor, <br/>
an engineer, and a lawyer or architect or accountant, maybe, in the family.<br/>
<br/>
It is clear to me that pursuing what they love is the key to my kids&#39; <br/>
happiness, but I do understand that it is kind of hard to remember that <br/>
sometimes because we also want our kids to be financially secure. We <br/>
have relatives who are out of work (architects, both of them) and it is <br/>
really scary to have a family and lose your home and not have money to <br/>
feed your children.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Chamille has been criticized by online friends for not going to school<br/>
and getting that &quot;necessary&quot; diploma.  Some have outright told her that<br/>
she will end up working fast food.  It&#39;s repeated phrases.<br/>
<br/>
When we&#39;ve talked about this, it&#39;s been in the car, so I drive her<br/>
through neighborhoods, and point things out, like, &quot;can you tell by<br/>
looking, if that person went to school and got a diploma?&quot; &quot;do you think<br/>
they are happy?&quot; &quot;do you think they had a choice about what they did in<br/>
life?&quot; &quot;was it a free choice?&quot; &quot;do you think anyone working at McDonalds<br/>
has a diploma?&quot; &quot;how many people who work there have college degrees?&quot;<br/>
&quot;do you think they are happy?&quot; &quot;what do you think that person does for a<br/>
living?&quot; &quot;do you think they like it?&quot; &quot;what do you think that person<br/>
would have done with their life if they&#39;d get to do it over?&quot; etc etc<br/>
etc...<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s fun &quot;what if&quot; question and answer games.  Sometimes it gets<br/>
outrageous!  The idea is that there are literally thousands of people<br/>
who all did what they were supposed to do, who aren&#39;t happy and wish<br/>
they could have a redo button, or a career change but can&#39;t because they<br/>
have kids to feed and car payments to make.  I don&#39;t want that for my<br/>
kids.  I would much rather have them happily doing what they want to do<br/>
and accept doing things they need to do simply because it&#39;s beneficial.<br/>
<br/>
Behind so many success stories, of people who became successful in life,<br/>
are really supportive parents.  I like finding those kinds of stories. <br/>
The guy who helped create The Sims is like that, can&#39;t remember his<br/>
name.  Chamille told me that Marilyn Manson is like that, and says that<br/>
his parents still go see his shows.  So, Chamille is looking too, at the<br/>
back stories of people and how they got where they are today.  I suppose<br/>
that there are some people who become successful monetarily by rejecting<br/>
everything their parents and everyone around them told them, but that<br/>
would be a harder road to go, I&#39;d think, and much less happy!<br/>

<br/>
And student loan payments, or the fear of the medical profession about  <br/>
letting someone they&#39;ve trained out into the world.<br/>
<br/>
A relative of someone close to our family is being coddled and  <br/>
counseled so that she&#39;ll finish a medical residency that she has said  <br/>
she doesn&#39;t like.  She didn&#39;t do wonderfully well in school, she  <br/>
didn&#39;t at all get a desireable residency, and she&#39;s tried to kill  <br/>
herself, and they still insist she should finish the residency and get  <br/>
all finished.  WHY?   She owes a ton of money and they need to get it  <br/>
out of her, maybe?   It&#39;s unnatural.   How many people will be treated  <br/>
by a doctor who has resisted for years now becoming a doctor?<br/>
<br/>
I wish she had one single person saying &quot;Become a potter,&quot; or &quot;Maybe  <br/>
you could work for a medical texbook publisher&quot; or ANYTHING that would  <br/>
help her get out of the lifelong trap she feels she&#39;s in.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1880300103">One of my sons said to me, &quot;I really think I want <br/>
playing music to always be the focus of my life, <br/>
but I don&#39;t want to be poor.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
And I said to him, &quot;Who is poor?  Is Ted poor?<br/>
Or is Judy poor?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ted is a musician we know, who has a very full<br/>
and happy life, and a very small house that<br/>
will never grace the pages of Better Homes<br/>
& Gardens.  Judy is an attorney we know who<br/>
has two very large and fancy homes in very<br/>
desirable locations, but who mutters to<br/>
herself every day as she drives home<br/>
from work, &quot;I hate my work... I hate<br/>
my work...&quot; and she works 12-14 hours<br/>
a day.<br/>
<br/>
Ted may work that many hours, too, but<br/>
in another sense, he doesn&#39;t work at all.<br/>
<br/>
You know the nursery tale:  &quot;Never Worked<br/>
and Never Will&quot;?  That&#39;s Ted.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if my son will be a musician,<br/>
but I hope he will be rich like Ted, not<br/>
rich like Judy.  <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, I remind him that &quot;what do you want <br/>
to be when you grow up?&quot; is a question adults ask <br/>
kids when those adults aren&#39;t sure what to<br/>
say to kids, adults who have forgotten<br/>
that kids are people, too, not &quot;just kids.&quot;<br/>

get a conversation started with kids, I have to say that your answers <br/>
would shut down that conversation in a pretty rude way. Instead, kids <br/>
can use the question to start talking about whatever they wanted to talk <br/>
about - say, &quot;I don&#39;t know, but I&#39;m really into video games right now.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Poor adults who don&#39;t know how to talk to kids - I really really feel <br/>
sorry for them. I enjoy talking to kids a lot, teenagers mostly, these <br/>
days. I&#39;m sitting here in my living room right now with Roxana and Rosie <br/>
and Rosie&#39;s boyfriend, Daniel, and her friend Katie. We just had a <br/>
conversation about people thinking about what they say before they let <br/>
it out of their mouths. Teenagers have conversations about things that <br/>
most adults wouldn&#39;t spend time talking about. Daniel pointed out that <br/>
he tends to listen a lot more when he&#39;s at our house, and talk a lot <br/>
less, then is usual for him. So we all talked about why that might be, <br/>
for a bit. I just really like how they&#39;re exploring their own nature - <br/>
learning about themselves.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-529897072">-=-Anyway, we&#39;ve found that adults who look at young people as students<br/>
and talk to them from that perspective aren&#39;t really open to talking to<br/>
them as people. But perhaps that is because we are shutting them<br/>
down-=-<br/>
<br/>
Everything you do is giving your children learning opportunities.   <br/>
When you respond to other people, they see what you say, and how, and  <br/>
they&#39;ll decide whether they think you were right or wrong.  Maybe  <br/>
they&#39;ll wish you had done differently and think less of you in the  <br/>
future.  Maybe they&#39;ll accept what you did as a good thing and emulate  <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
-=And then the compliments that are *not* really compliments, like,  <br/>
&quot;Wow,<br/>
your kids are really well-behaved in a restaurant!&quot; said after a meal<br/>
in a fancy restaurant, always by some couple who thought their<br/>
quiet evening out was going to be disturbed by our family. The response,<br/>
&quot;Thanks. You are, too!&quot; fairly rolls off the tongue.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yikes.   That would cancel out the niceness AND the compliment.<br/>
Lots of times people told me my kids were nice, were well behaved,  <br/>
were cute, that they enjoyed eating near us.  And my kids are  <br/>
biological matches for me and my husband.   Should I have been  <br/>
defensive or insulted?   What!?  And discourage those people from  <br/>
being talkative and nice to other people in the future?<br/>
<br/>
  -=-Because, really, the<br/>
presumption that young people are going to be loud and rude and<br/>
ill-mannered is pretty offensive. It&#39;s prejudice, but most people in<br/>
mainstream society don&#39;t see it.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not &quot;prejudice&quot; if the people have been around loud and rude and  <br/>
ill-mannered young people.  Haven&#39;t you?  I&#39;ve been around loud and  <br/>
rude and ill-mannered drunks, and so I assume most drunks will behave  <br/>
badly, in groups, in restaurants.   That&#39;s experience, not prejudice.<br/>
<br/>
Both Kirby and Marty have worked in restaurants and have stories of  <br/>
the Very Bad Manners of &quot;schoolkids&quot; who are away from their parents  <br/>
and able to make some choices for the first times.   And some kids are  <br/>
tacky even when they&#39;re with their parents.<br/>
<br/>
-=-people who will talk to the children as human beings rather than as  <br/>
&quot;just kids,&quot; -=-<br/>
<br/>
It does seem a little like you&#39;ve sorted adults into some who aren&#39;t  <br/>
really worth your time and some who are.  It&#39;s a similar prejudice.   <br/>
If you&#39;re nice, you might inspire them to be nice too.  Maybe they  <br/>
honestly haven&#39;t ever had a real conversation with real kids, and  <br/>
yours might be the first, if you give it a chance.<br/>
<br/>
Cynicism and pessimism are poison to unschooling.<br/>

and she was standing in the bird book aisle of the book store for a long <br/>
time, browsing. There was a man there, too, and after a while he asked <br/>
her some lame adult question - &quot;You seem really interested in birds, are <br/>
you doing a school report?&quot; &lt;G&gt;<br/>

She said, &quot;No, I just like birds.&quot; They got started talking - I was <br/>
hearing them from down a ways in the same aisle. He was an ornithologist <br/>
from the nearby state college.He got over talking down to her and was <br/>
visibly impressed and enjoying their conversation within a minute or <br/>
two. She was about 10 or so.<br/>
<br/>
Can&#39;t expect that most of the time but that is how small talk works <br/>

Sometimes it leads to a great conversation and sometimes it just fades away.<br/>

I grew up in a family that wasn&#39;t into happy and good and light and sweet.<br/>
When I left home at 27, I hadn&#39;t learned any other way, squirreled away from<br/>
the &quot;bad&quot; in the world.  I went on to college.  Gosh it was hard.  Nobody<br/>
thought like I did.<br/>
<br/>
A friend called me on it and said I could choose differently.  I was driving<br/>
and cursing other drivers, and my behavior was scaring her so she said what<br/>
she said.  It made quite an impression on me.  I was shocked but I had a lot<br/>
of respect for her opinion and I thanked her.<br/>
<br/>
I got over the negativity by actively disbelieving it whenever it came to<br/>
mind.  And I&#39;ve been very glad of it.  I know I&#39;m happy whereas before I<br/>
really couldn&#39;t see that.<br/>

years old now, I think. In 1999 or so he was helping me take my <br/>
groceries out to my car and he saw my car license plate holder that <br/>
says, &quot;I break for Muggles.&quot; He laughed and laughed. And then he got <br/>
serious and said that people were mean to Hermione because she was a <br/>
mudblood and people were mean to him because he has Down Syndrome. He&#39;d <br/>
listened to both of the first two Harry Potter books that were out by <br/>
that time. . He loves his job - he&#39;s very friendly and enjoys the social <br/>
aspects of talking to customers. But sometimes someone isn&#39;t friendly <br/>
and he gets his feelings hurt and gets upset. He told me that all the <br/>
checkers there are really nice and if he gets a little upset they tell <br/>
him to go outside and bring in the carts. He said that even when the <br/>
weather is bad, he likes to go out and do that because it helps him calm <br/>
down. I always ask him to help me take my groceries out to the car <br/>
because I know he likes to do it and because he absolutely always leaves <br/>
me feeling uplifted. I love thinking about what good work he is doing - <br/>
not the bagging groceries and bringing in carts - he&#39;s spreading good <br/>
cheer on a daily basis to probably hundreds of people. How many of us <br/>
can say that?<br/>

I&#39;ve learned a TON from him about taking joy in the moment, in the task at<br/>
hand. He downright *loves* doing things that I myself used to consider<br/>
boring chores like unloading the dishwasher, weeding the garden, sweeping<br/>
the floor. Stevie takes such pleasure in those jobs, both the ones he can do<br/>
(like the dishwasher) and the ones I do that he can help with (like whenever<br/>
I&#39;m sweeping he has the dustpan at the ready), and that happiness has, over<br/>
the years, &#39;infected&#39; everyone in the house, so that I think all of us take<br/>
more pleasure in those kinds of mundane tasks than we once did. I have found<br/>
that I truly LOVE weeding the garden. It&#39;s peaceful and calming. I used to<br/>
find it tedious, maybe because I lumped it into a &#39;boring chore&#39; category of<br/>
activity and entered the task with my mind already made up about it in a<br/>
negative way. Stevie doesn&#39;t saddle the business (busy-ness) of life with<br/>
those assumptions; he takes genuine pleasure in being able to DO. &quot;I do it,<br/>
Mom!&quot; is one of his most frequent statements. I&#39;m really grateful for the<br/>
things I&#39;ve learned from him.<br/>
<br/>
And this is a bit of a leap, but it seems to me to be the same sort of<br/>
thing--I remember a passage in The Continuum Concept when Jean Liedloff<br/>
talks about learning from the example & cheerful attitudes of the Yequana<br/>
Indian woman she was living with. There&#39;s a bit where she talks about<br/>
walking up (or maybe down) a steep hill and feeling the burn in her leg<br/>
muscles, and realizing that once upon a time she would have felt negative<br/>
and complainy about that, the strain, the tired feeling, but it struck her<br/>
now that it was a great thing to feel one&#39;s muscles working, performing as<br/>
they ought to, and a great thing to be able to climb a hill, and balance,<br/>
and have a body able to take her where she wanted to go.<br/>
<br/>
I really appreciate people like Stevie and Liedloff who cause me to notice<br/>
things I take for granted and to question my assumptions, and remind me how<br/>
much joy there is in the daily tasks of life. (Which are also the reasons<br/>
why I read this list, though I hardly ever post.)<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m glad you posted, Lissa.<br/>
<br/>
My middle child is not a child now, he&#39;s 20.  Marty worked for over a  <br/>
year at a grocery store.  He was a &quot;courtesy clerk.&quot;  He bagged  <br/>
groceries, swept floors and brought in carts.  He helped people find  <br/>
things, and washed the glass doors of dairy and freezer cases.<br/>
<br/>
While he was there, he turned 18, and when it was nearly his birthday,  <br/>
the heads of nearly each department--bakery, produce, dairy, stocking-- <br/>
said &quot;So Marty... you&#39;re nearly 18.  Do you want to work with me?&quot;     <br/>
He was flattered, but he really only wanted to do what he was doing.   <br/>
He liked the physical exertion.  He liked the tetris-skill application  <br/>
of bagging groceries efficiently (and beyond Tetris and shapes,  <br/>
because now there were weights and temperatures and chemical dangers  <br/>
involved).  He liked going outside and talking to people and helping  <br/>
them.   I pressed him to apply to be a checker, because they make way  <br/>
better money, but he said it didn&#39;t seem like a fun job.<br/>
<br/>
Now he works at a restaurant.  He busses tables.  They assumed he  <br/>
would want to learn the menu and be a waiter, but he doesn&#39;t.    <br/>
Recently a waiter was busted back to bussing tables and he was  <br/>
frustrated by that, and embarrassed, and he quit.   Marty, though, has  <br/>
found joy in figuring out ways to do his job more artfully and quickly  <br/>
and quietly and takes pride in all the tables looking beautiful and in  <br/>
cheering up the waiters and dishwashers and cooks in various ways.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a Buddhist concept that&#39;s fairly foreign in Western  <br/>
Civilization, in recent centuries anyway:  Right Livelihood.<br/>
It has to do with morals and mental health, and living a good life.    <br/>
It has to do with making a living in such a way that other people are  <br/>
served and not harmed, and the person acting is not harmed.<br/>
<br/>
 From his jobs, Marty gets personal satisfaction, enough money to make  <br/>
his jeep payments, to entertain his friends, and to put money in  <br/>
savings (he still lives at home so rent and utilities aren&#39;t at stake  <br/>
yet), and he get exercise, exposure to different kinds of people, the  <br/>
opportunity to learn about things he didn&#39;t even know existed (foods,  <br/>
equipment, stories people bring in to work).  He gets to be a calming  <br/>
influence and to make his co-worker&#39;s lives better.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps in western civilization, or at least within Christianity, it&#39;s  <br/>
related to a religious life, or &quot;vocation.&quot;  That&#39;s not always being a  <br/>
priest or a nun or a minister.   And all of those things can be done  <br/>
for better reasons and worse reasons.   Unfortunately, our culture  <br/>
does NOT prize and value those who will take less money to have a more  <br/>
satisfying life.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s unfortunate.  Someone who can go home from work without worry or  <br/>
guilt is way ahead of the game.   Some people have to pay money to go  <br/>
to the gym to get exercise, and then buy sleeping pills because  <br/>
they&#39;re thinking about work instead of sleeping, and then go to a  <br/>
counsellor or psychiatrist because their lives and health are being  <br/>
ruined by stress.   They probably don&#39;t have more available income  <br/>
than Marty has. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

(getting colder) while I cleaned the hot tub (involves water, in cold  <br/>
and wind).<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s ok though!  It&#39;s true what you wrote above!  When people live in<br/>
the negativity, in the smallness, in the dark, it&#39;s often that they<br/>
don&#39;t even realize they are living there, from where they are it looks<br/>
just fine, and bright and cozy, they just haven&#39;t gone outside yet where<br/>
the sunshine and fresh air is to compare it to!<br/>
<br/>
But, boy, once who walk out into that sunshine, going back to that dark<br/>
place is hard, and really obviously a dark place.  When I catch myself<br/>
getting stuck there, I make an effort to focus on everything that IS<br/>
good and wonderful right around me, right now.  It&#39;s too easy to forget<br/>
all the good things and focus on the yuck, especially if it&#39;s something<br/>
that you grew up with, and it tends to feel natural at first (learned<br/>
behavior patterns).  My parents always called me the peace maker, so<br/>
it&#39;s been in my nature to gravitate towards peace and calm and happy,<br/>
and even as a kid, I had the ability to shine that onto my family, and<br/>
now I get to do that for my own family!<br/>
<br/>
I firmly believe that without it, learning and living can&#39;t be to their<br/>
full potential!  Happy minds are open minds.  There is something about<br/>
happiness that creates open receptive living!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-215266323">Simon and I watched the end of Judy Garland&#39;s A Star is Born together late last night and had a long conversation about stress and suicide and options and perception. Judy Garland in a movie about surviving a suicide was an interesting thing for all of this to spiral around. It also spurred conversations about alcohol as a depressant and why it was awful for James Mason to keep getting drunk when he was depressed and why he might have kept reaching for the bottle. <br/>
<br/>
At some point Simon said that he has a really good life and he never feels without options. I thought that was a cool thing to hear. Better than A&#39;s on a report card or a good parent-teacher conference. His life isn&#39;t filled with the intensely fearful moments of knowing that you are going to be in trouble for something that you just did or filled with shame and awfulness that I can remember with such vividness that it can spiral me down into horrible negativity and anger just revisiting them. My dad kept some of the mean notes that I wrote to him and my mom when I was little telling them that they were horribly mean parents and that I felt really bad to be their child. They were probably both funny and sad to him and maybe he wanted to give me perspective if my children felt that way. My children don&#39;t feel that way enough to have ever written me a card saying that they do. <br/>

We have 5 cats, 4 of whom are the offspring of the remaining 1. 1 of the sibling cats is bullied by all of her siblings and her mom and she got really stressed out. She was peeing all over the house and the furniture. David&#39;s first response was to limit her life to that of an outdoor cat, but we have a conservatory that can be closed off from the rest of the house so we set that up for her. During the day everyone of the humans in her life goes and sits with her. She doesn&#39;t get bullied nearly as much by her feline family and she gets to eat when she wants as her food is separate from the rest. Her life is better having her own room and her own place to withdraw to. When she does get into the rest of the house she tends to head back to her room fairly quickly. She likes feeling calm and good and safe and not scared and stressed and bad. It has been fascinating to watch (after dealing with the smell of cat urine on so many pieces of furniture) her deal<br/>
 with this stress in her life. <br/>

It&#39;s called &quot;joy.&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
I think it has to do with gratitude.<br/>

So far this morning I posted one &quot;Pollyanna&quot; blog post, talked to  <br/>
Marty, then Kirby called and we had him on speaker phone, but Marty  <br/>
had to go to work, and then I talked to Keith about the weather  <br/>
(getting colder) while I cleaned the hot tub (involves water, in cold  <br/>
and wind).<br/>
<br/>
Then I e-mailed Keith, who&#39;s at work on a Monday:<br/>
<br/>
    Subject:     hot tub is clean and filling<br/>
FREEZING out there, but I remembered that under such circumstances,  <br/>
the warmest place is crouched down inside that hot tub!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Then I checked e-mail and found this post about happy and calm!<br/>
<br/>
Happy and calm is huge.  It&#39;s health.  It&#39;s hope.  It&#39;s life.<br/>
<br/>
Negativity is smallness, dark, and living, creeping hell.<br/>
<br/>
The blog post this morning is here:<br/>

Did he keep them so he could make you feel bad again when you were  <br/>
grown?<br/>
Does he see them now as an indictment of his parenting decisions?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-383392483">I don&#39;t know why he kept them or why he sent them. He sent them in a bundle of things he had found that he thought I would want the last time he moved. I don&#39;t know how much he thinks about himself as a parent, I think that was long ago and far away and any indictment couldn&#39;t be made to stick in his mind since the statutory limitations have run out. He told me once he figured I got the short end of the stick as a child, but that I turned out alright so the stick must not have been that short for anyone. I think he&#39;s probably right in many ways, but sending me a bundle of things that underscored the crappy points in my childhood doesn&#39;t do much but help me wallow.<br/>
<br/>
The cards and letters make me sad for me and for my parents. But they also make me happy to not have any to keep or pass forward to Simon and Linnaea. Not that I would. I figure remembering those moments doesn&#39;t make me feel better, why would I want them to remember those feelings if they had them and wrote notes to tell me about them?<br/>

less saccharine than the movie. You get to see more of her  <br/>
deliberately working at finding a way to be happy.<br/>
