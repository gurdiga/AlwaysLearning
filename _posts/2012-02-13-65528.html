<div id="ygrps-yiv-1228311536">Although it has been a year since school I feel like I am only truly starting to deschool now as there have been so many times where I have let fear and misunderstanding get in the way.  I feel really lost at the moment as I don&#39;t feel like I am creating a sparkly, fun environment.  <br/>
<br/>
My 9yr old son&#39;s main interests at the moment are playing on his Ipod Touch and PC computer games.  PC games are limited as we have a work computer where personal data usage is monitored so we are selling lots of stuff to create the funds for another computer, (this will give more opportunities for us to connect).  <br/>
<br/>
Currently though he mainly plays his IPod and I feel like I am not providing enough cool other stuff to do.  He is an only child and the local Home-schooling group is virtually non-existent.  We have just joined another group further away and are hopeful that this will help the lack of friend&#39;s situation.  He does Circus and Cubs and enjoys them both but has not made any real friends as there seems to be a of playground socialising mentality which he finds difficult. <br/>
<br/>
He had an absolutely dreadful school experience and consequently has very little motivation.  He is very opposed to any activity that has any `schooly&#39; aspects to it; I am getting better at finding TV programmes and books that he finds interesting. Any project ideas or excursions we come up with start of fun but quickly go flat.<br/>
<br/>
I do have type one diabetes (I was very unwell when my son was an infant) which I control with an insulin pump.  I have found ways to be able able to lead a full life but my health has taken a dip with the lack of exercise and focus I was used to with our son at school. <br/>
<br/>
He has been through such a lot and I am so proud of his strength and courage, I have realised that I need to stop talking/worrying about everything and show him that life is fun. I would love some tips on sparklyness!<br/>

<br/>
Can you go for picnics with him?  Are there malls or museums where you are, where you could go and walk?  What about skating (roller blades or ice skates)? I don&#39;t know... thinking of things you could do together that had a destination, not &quot;just exercise,&quot; but things to do, things to see.<br/>

<br/>
Yeah... if you&#39;ve been telling him &quot;I am so proud of your strength and courage,&quot; that&#39;s probably making the rest of the world and the rest of humanity seem pretty awful.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of parents talk too much.  I talk too much lots of times.  :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-985847440">I would say try and find as many things that you don&#39;t normally do and just try them.  <br/>
<br/>
Bowling, climbing gym, archery, fencing, find a place that has pinball, paintball, an  indoor or out door skate park, those wall to wall trampoline places.  I get a lot of my exercise playing &quot;Monster Mama&quot; a game we made up from the book by Stephen Gammell.  It doesn&#39;t have to be so planned.  I might all of a sudden say, &quot;Race you to the car!&quot;  Or we might find utube videos and dance or Self Defense or Karate Moves. I guess those are suggestions if you want to exercise with him.  Big Boxes are still a hit for my Son at 10.<br/>
<br/>
We started baking more here and my oldest said the other day with a big smile, you have been making lots of cookies.  I think it was sparkley for him.  I didn&#39;t make them help, though the youngest did.<br/>
<br/>
Bubbles on glass we played with for hours blowing them up with straws<br/>
and then we threw in some food coloring.  Fun!<br/>
<br/>
There are clubs for almost any interest out there and that might be a good place to meet people with similar interests.  <br/>
Start your own group. Then you might attract people that have something in common with your son. Maybe not but I find putting yourself out there is the best way to make friends.  I have taken numbers from people who my kids have met at parks and made an effort to reconnect with those people again.  I ask my kids first if they might like to see that person again and then I just say to the mom that the kids seem to play well, would they like to arrange going to the park again.  We&#39;ve made friends doing that.<br/>
