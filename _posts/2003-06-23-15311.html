<div id="ygrps-yiv-1450981718">Forgive me for not remembering your name, but who is it here that&#39;s from <br/>
Hernando?  We spoke about the Unschoolers of Memphis, remember?<br/>
<br/>
Well, on the Memphis Mamas list there is a person moving to Hernando from VA <br/>
who is looking for UNSCHOOLING, attachment parenting types!  She&#39;ll be in <br/>
Hernando in a matter of weeks, I think.  I told her I would hook you two up.<br/>
<br/>
So where ya be?  Email me and I&#39;ll send you her email address.<br/>
