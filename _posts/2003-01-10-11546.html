&lt;&lt; I was in the car heading to The National Plastics Museum with Julian, who <br/>
is <br/>
13, the other day. (I bet you didn&#39;t know there WAS one! Neither did I.) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Before I read ONE MORE WORD of what you wrote, I want to say this:<br/>
<br/>
I love plastics.  Not I love plastic things, but I&#39;m fascinated in an <br/>
ignorant way with the differences in the way different vinyls feel, in the <br/>
stuff milk-gallon &quot;bottles&quot; are made of.  Of Lego vs. the other harder, cheap <br/>
knock-off stuff.  I don&#39;t understand enough chemistry to read anything <br/>
technical about plastics engineering but of all the sciences that is the one <br/>
that calls to me.  Like some people want to go to Hawaii (I never have wanted <br/>
to), I want to know more about plastics.<br/>
<br/>
In the desert, some plastics just die at some point.  Their life is done.  <br/>
Too much dry heat, and one season the whole thing (toy or dashboard of a car <br/>
or moulding on a tool or something) just cracks and falls apart.  Kind of the <br/>
way glue on old paperbacks from the 1960&#39;s or 70&#39;s just dies one year and <br/>
that&#39;s that.   Then there are some plastics which seem not to have that <br/>
problem.<br/>
<br/>
When we went to Indiana years ago for a homeschooling slumber party (an <br/>
e-mail loop decided to get together and eight (?) families met in Indiana at <br/>
a big house for a long weekend) I had requested a trip to a plastics factory, <br/>
but the hostess didn&#39;t think I was serious.  And there might not have been <br/>
any anyway.  I think there are in Illinois, and in Missouri, but Indiana <br/>
seemed to have corn fields like Texas has oil wells--in every vacant lot and <br/>
along every roadway.<br/>
<br/>
So now having confessed my fascination, maybe some of you will find a little <br/>
flyer or a website or something that will give my plastic-loving soul a <br/>
thrill.  <br/>
<br/>
And the most wonderful plastic (vinyl) I have ever touched was some soft baby <br/>
toys from Finland, I think, that Discovery Toys used to sell.  We had an <br/>
elephant and a giraffe, and I&#39;ve never known finer manufactured material.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also interested in the &quot;lumber&quot; made out of recycled trash bags.  Our <br/>
city busstop benches here are made of it, and in Alamogordo there&#39;s a big <br/>
wooden kids&#39; playground, but the boardwalks are made with that plastic wood.  <br/>
I don&#39;t know how long it will last in the sun in the heat in Alamogordo, but <br/>
it has the feel of outlasting real wood at least ten times over.<br/>

My husband is an (unschooled) injection molding process engineer (by title only).  The company he works for makes connectors for computers, phones, and such.  You know those little plastic things you plug your phone into?  He started out as a janitor (cleaning toilets and mowing the grounds at another plant) and progressed to the actual molding of various items such as Christmas tree stands, those huge paper clip letter holder thingies, and even drinking cups.  He finds plastics utterly fascinating.  We cannot go anywhere without him letting us know exactly what type of plastic something is made of......polystyrene, pvc, polypropolene, polyethelene, nylon, etc.....<br/>
<br/>
Here are some things he suggested to find out more:<br/>
Plastics News--he said it is a magazine but they might have a website<br/>
Society of Plastic Engineers---they should have a website<br/>
American Plastics Counsel--they do all of those commercials on tv<br/>
<br/>
His favorite statement is &quot;plastic is our friend&quot; and he uses it fairly often.  :)<br/>

I think it&#39;s called TREX.  (A friend had a deck made out of it, but I&#39;ve<br/>
only heard the word pronounced.)<br/>

In Santa Cruz they have a plastic boardwalk made of this stuff that goes<br/>
down the beach.  And they have a plastic wheelchair available so that<br/>
people who can&#39;t walk can still get in the water and get a little wet. <br/>

and I told her not to.  <br/>
<br/>
But anyway...<br/>
<br/>
She said that when she grew up she wanted to work in a factory like on Mr. <br/>
Rogers.  Maybe where they made socks.  Or maybe a factory where they made (I <br/>
forget what, raincoats, I think--cutting with an electric cutter through <br/>
piles of fabric), or Fig Newtons...<br/>
<br/>
We said maybe she would get bored after half a day.  <br/>
<br/>
She named some other factories.  The other kids who were with us had seen <br/>
those shows too.  I had seen a couple of them.  And I told them about the <br/>
Levi&#39;s factory I had been in one time to deliver something, and had walked by <br/>
piles of pockets, piles of back left leg...<br/>
<br/>
But ultimately I said I thought maybe what she wanted to do when she grew up <br/>
was to watch Mr. Rogers&#39; factory tour videos!<br/>

(six months, maybe).  Lots of people who work in factories work in more than <br/>
one over the course of their lives.  It can be fun if you take the right <br/>
attitude. <br/>
<br/>
I like jobs like that because it&#39;s easy to think and not worry about too <br/>
much.  <br/>
<br/>
It would be more fun to me, though, to design the systems they use in <br/>
factories.  I can always see where it could be more efficient to do it this <br/>
way or that.<br/>

Keebler Cookies.<br/>
Yep, you guessed it.  I was a Keebler Elf for a whole summer. (grin)  I <br/>
came home smelling like chocolate every single night. (actually, every <br/>
morning as I worked the night shift.)  Did you know Keebler Elves are <br/>
unionized?<br/>
<br/>
I used to have nightmares about those chocolate chip cookies coming down <br/>
the conveyer belt and not being able to keep up with them.... until they <br/>
moved me to the PopTart line.  That was cool.  I had a big red button that <br/>
would dump Poptarts into the refuse bin and another that would shut down my <br/>
part of the line entirely.  And yes, we munched on them until we couldn&#39;t <br/>
stand it (although you weren&#39;t supposed to.)<br/>
<br/>
I can think of a lot of worse jobs, but it gets REALLY dull, really fast.<br/>
Tell her that if she really wants a factory job, work QA because it will <br/>
let her wander around and visit with people.  Everyone else has to stay put <br/>
in their spots.<br/>

My best friend works at a plastics plant, it&#39;s right behind our apartment <br/>
complex here.  They don&#39;t actually manufacture the plastic but extrude sheets <br/>
and make parts.  They make everything from the pots one buys plants in to car <br/>
and truck parts; frozen dinner containers, RV sinks, TV and VCR casings for <br/>
autos, etc.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re ever near Portland (we&#39;re just south of there) give us a call, she <br/>
would be happy to give you a tour.  Now that you&#39;ve mentioned this, I realize <br/>
I&#39;ve never gone through the plant, I should.<br/>
