<div id="ygrps-yiv-1006359277">&lt;&lt;the prize of eternal life&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I am Christian and have little interest in eternal life.  I agree that when<br/>
groups focus on their &quot;eternal reward&quot;, love of God seems more like &quot;what&#39;s<br/>
in it for me?&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I personally, think the Bible is full of fallacies, because men wrote it,<br/>
introducing human error.  Yes, I know that is blasphemous to some.  But I do<br/>
believe that when you hear truth, you recognize it.  I hear truth when I<br/>
read the words of Jesus.  But Jesus never seemed real thrilled with his<br/>
disciples&#39; grasp of what he was trying to teach them.  What was the verse<br/>
&quot;How long will I have to put up with you?&quot;, something like that.<br/>
<br/>
I feel pretty sure that Jesus&#39; teachings were tremendously distorted very<br/>
soon after his death.<br/>
