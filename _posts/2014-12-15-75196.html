<div id="ygrps-yiv-496753039"><p><span>By golly,&nbsp; I am so excited.&nbsp; I was given some new reading to help me see &quot;my thinking&quot; and what was holding me back.&nbsp; As I went through&nbsp;the list I recognized a lot of the material&nbsp;but then I came around to this one...</span></p><p><span></span>&nbsp;</p><p><span>*The first stage is the longest and most difficult and involves getting rid of  all school-think, which includes classes and &quot;instruction&quot; and school-speak. &nbsp;Lovejoy *</span></p><p><span></span>&nbsp;</p><p><span>As I thought on this, I realized I have put aside the curriculum, the test and all the other school looking things,&nbsp; however, my brain still has an inch of &quot;school thinking&quot; dust on it.&nbsp; So as I have set aside (just in case someone comes over) everything schoolish , I&nbsp;still carry a brain full of worry about what if _________ (exert name) finds out and what will they say!&nbsp; Yikes!&nbsp; </span></p><p><span></span>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Okay, there you have it...truth!&nbsp; I was holding on to my homeschool room.&nbsp; It is for appearance!&nbsp; </span></p><p><span></span>&nbsp;</p><p><span>So I went into my closet and did some self talking and realized I had to get the Pledge out and dust my brain clean of a lot of &quot;words&quot;!&nbsp; My vocabulary will be changed forever!&nbsp; Thank you!&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, I will have to stop worrying about what people will say or even think.&nbsp; </span></p><p><span></span>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Then the most amazing thing happened.&nbsp; I saw my sister in a different light too.&nbsp; I allowed her &quot;hot schoolish breath&quot;&nbsp;to fog up my vision.&nbsp; So I had to get the Windex out&nbsp;and wipe my foggy vision...phew.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span></span>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Now I really see it and really know what I need to do.&nbsp; :D&nbsp; No more &quot;homeschool room&quot;.&nbsp; Period.&nbsp; The room will&nbsp; be reorganized and be like any other room in the house.&nbsp; Not set separated from our living but a part of everyday living and enjoyment.&nbsp; The kids already have a few ideas.&nbsp; A gaming center with a couch and a ping pong table.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp; </span></p><p><span>Also, I read about &quot;urgency&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;I really know now why this list has to be the way it is and should be.&nbsp;It is love and concern. To get our head out of our&nbsp;butt.&nbsp;&nbsp;I cried and cried!&nbsp; It really is because we don&#39;t have much time and if we parents don&#39;t get this grounded, &nbsp;we are wasting precious time with our little ones.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span></span>&nbsp;</p><p><span>&nbsp;It is about my children and my &quot;dusty brain and foggy eyes&quot; are getting in their way.&nbsp;&nbsp;No more!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p><span></span>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Later on....</span></p><p><span></span>&nbsp;</p><p><span>My 15 year old daughter said, &quot;Hey, let&#39;s all watch Monster&#39;s Inc.&quot;.&nbsp; Everyone agreed and then as we were watching it, something amazing happened.&nbsp; The same daughter told me how much she loved this movie and that she saw things she never saw before, because I can now think for myself.&nbsp; I smiled.&nbsp; </span><span>Next, I had taped Frosty the Snowman and forgot about it.&nbsp; After Monster&#39;s Inc.&nbsp;the children saw it on the DVR and watched it too.&nbsp; My 7 year was in shock that the teacher would not let the children out to play in the snow.&nbsp; She let me know quickly how much she loved me...and&nbsp;said very&nbsp;loudly and proudly&nbsp;that her mother would let her&nbsp;go out in the snow to play.&nbsp; :D&nbsp;&nbsp; A small hope that I am on the right path, now on to the journey&nbsp;of a life of learning for me and my children!&nbsp; </span></p><p><span></span>&nbsp;</p><p><span>From the bottom of my heart...thank you!&nbsp; I am forever changed.&nbsp; :D</span></p><p><span>Jen</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span></span>&nbsp;</p><p><span></span>&nbsp;</p><p><span></span>&nbsp;</p><p><span></span>&nbsp;</p></div>
