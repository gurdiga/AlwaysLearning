<div id="ygrps-yiv-1220410334">Dear all,<br/>
<br/>
My older son is 8 (almost 9), he has been wanting to work since he was <br/>
5. He is dabbling in modeling with what seems like a reputable agency, <br/>
but he wants to work more often! I have been thinking of offering our <br/>
neighbors dog walking services and possibly setting some sort of <br/>
service to help during garages sales. My son LOVES to sell things. Any <br/>
other creative ideas?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance!<br/>
<br/>
From Sunny Florida!!!<br/>

I was amazed at how well Wyl (9) did this year with a lemonade  stand. He had <br/>
real lemonade (as opposed to powdered mixes), ice and even lemon  and lime <br/>
wedges (which didn&#39;t go over well at all) to dress them up. Teen gals  just <br/>
&quot;aww!&quot; ed over him and lots of folks gave him tips and one lady even gave  him the <br/>
price of a cup plus a tip but didn&#39;t like lemonade! When it got  cooler, he <br/>
tried a cider and donut stand (we&#39;re on a main route for kids walking  home <br/>
from the high school), but for some reason didn&#39;t do as well. As we were  setting <br/>
up the cider stand, though, a man pulled up and bought $5 worth of  donuts <br/>
because he likes to help young entrepreneurs wherever he can! I thought  that <br/>
was pretty cool. His profit from the lemonade stand (after supplies) was  $25 <br/>
(over 4 weeks-we had our own stand at the local farmer&#39;s market and he sat  his <br/>
up next to us).<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve heard lots of other suggestions on groups (maybe an  archive search <br/>
might turn something up?), but this is what we&#39;ve tried that  worked fairly well <br/>
for Wyl.<br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>

Cleaning people&#39;s dog yards on a regular basis.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been buying vinyl gloves to do yard work here and picking up poo  <br/>
(we&#39;re in the desert and it dries out) is easy with gloves.<br/>
