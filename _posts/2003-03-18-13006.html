<div id="ygrps-yiv-1202347146">Penny:  Here&#39;s an example of one of our days, which I doubt is that much<br/>
different from anyone else who unschools.<br/>
<br/>
Today the temperature dropped from the 80 of yesterday into the high 50&#39;s.<br/>
When I opened the blinds in the living room this morning I noticed all my<br/>
new flower pots that are going into the new garden (when it&#39;s done) were<br/>
completely full up with mud and had crayons sticking out of them.  I also<br/>
saw a pair of pants and some underwear in the mud and decided to leave it<br/>
there until later (or until Steve my DH) went and got them.  Max and I built<br/>
a garage for about 15 mins then I made him some breakfast which he ate on a<br/>
towel on my bed while he watched the beginning of a Bug&#39;s Life.  Zak woke up<br/>
about 7:30am and decided to make gifts for me.  He took some art supplies<br/>
and wrapped up some of his toy soilders for me and also a pack of tissues.<br/>
He very carefully decorated them and then gave them to me.  <br/>
<br/>
Zak went off to his room to play Where in the World is Carmen San Diego? On<br/>
his computer, and also Lego Racers II.  Both boys had breakfast with Steve<br/>
and helped empty the dishwasher and put the laundry on.  Zak came to talk to<br/>
me about the Planets and the difference between astronomy and astrology and<br/>
what he thought the Planets should mean.<br/>
<br/>
Zak spent lots of time waiting by the window for his friend Taylor to come<br/>
over at 11:45am.  They went to see the Diamond Backs play the Rockies (it&#39;s<br/>
spring training here).  They went with Taylor&#39;s 2 grandma&#39;s one of which<br/>
Taylor lives with.  Zak didn&#39;t get home till 5pm.  I worked all morning in<br/>
my office while Steve was with the boys.  Steve left to have lunch with a<br/>
friend and then came back to the house to work while I and the boys were all<br/>
gone (peace and quiet for him he said it was wonderful)<br/>
<br/>
Max and I got a shower and we went to the park to meet friends for a couple<br/>
of hours.  Went to Target to buy new underwear for Max (lots of accidents at<br/>
the moment) and then to our Pottery Class with other unschoolers.  <br/>
<br/>
Steve made a wonderful pot roast and we had dinner together and talked about<br/>
our day.  Zak told us all about the game and who won and where they say and<br/>
how cold it was (for Tucson) and that he&#39;d had a hot dog and a coke and was<br/>
with Taylor&#39;s grandmas (both of them went).  He seemed quieter than usual<br/>
for Zak and so I probed him a little about what he and Taylor talked about.<br/>
It turns out that Taylor had told Zak that Peter (another friend of Zak&#39;s)<br/>
hated him and so there was about an hour of dealing with the emotions that<br/>
went with that and what Zak wanted to do about the situation.  He ended up<br/>
calling Peter and talking to him on the phone about their Game Boy Advanced<br/>
games and the Power Puff Girls movies.  He also asked Peter for a playdate<br/>
next week.  Peter was thrilled.  Zak asked him about hating him and he<br/>
didn&#39;t know what Zak was talking about (personally I knew this to not be<br/>
true because of issues Taylor has in his own growing up, but I wanted Zak to<br/>
handle it).  Zak&#39;s mood changed after that conversation and Zak seemed to be<br/>
more at peace with himself.  <br/>
<br/>
After dinner both boys helped clean up the kitchen, pick up their toys in<br/>
the common areas.  Both boys went into Zak&#39;s room to have popcorn, coke and<br/>
watch the Lion King II while Steve and I went and had sex!!!  Got to get it<br/>
when you can!!!!  About half an hour later Max was ready to come into our<br/>
room and watch a movie in our bed and fell asleep within about 5 mins, while<br/>
Zak stayed up till 10:30pm talking about how he wanted a sleepover with<br/>
Taylor, playing with his Lego Racers Board Game, playing 5 Crowns with<br/>
Steve. He and Steve talked about what having a sleepover means, what might<br/>
happen, what he would like to happen.  Steve and he read books until Zak<br/>
decided to go back to playing on his computer.<br/>
<br/>
As my back (I&#39;m having lots of problems with my back) was hurting I took a<br/>
muscle relaxer (as a last resort for the pain) and lay on the couch to watch<br/>
Law and Order (5 shows back to back on TNT).  I fell asleep about 9:30pm.<br/>
Steve came and guided me to bed at 11:15pm after he&#39;d finished doing some<br/>
work for my business.<br/>
<br/>
Is this a typical day?  I don&#39;t know that there is one.  As I write this on<br/>
Tuesday morning Max is building with Legos in the living room while Zak is<br/>
in his bedroom watching the Great Mouse Detective and eating breakfast.  He<br/>
just told us that staying up till 10:30pm was too late for him as it makes<br/>
him very emotional the next day and unable to concentrate and that he&#39;s<br/>
going to go to bed earlier in the future.  He said he needs time away from<br/>
Max and that&#39;s why he&#39;s in his room.  He&#39;s looking forward to Elliott coming<br/>
over in a couple of hours (best friend since born).....<br/>
<br/>
What I do know is that there is no weekend in our house.  Each day is just<br/>
each day.  We do the next thing whatever that may be.  Sometimes it involves<br/>
going out, staying in, talking, reading, watching videos, having playdates,<br/>
library, park, me working, Steve working, me with the kids, him with the<br/>
kids, going to homeschooling events, such as Roots and Shoots or the park<br/>
meetings.... Anyway enough of my rambling Penny, I hope this helps.<br/>
<br/>
One last thing.  This biggest change for us has been about letting go of<br/>
control and just trusting that our kids know what they need and following<br/>
their desires.  Reading about deschooling ourselves was very helpful and<br/>
also having a great support system.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with your journey.<br/>
