<div id="ygrps-yiv-42358781">I&#39;ve jumped right into the unfooding thing. I think once you get <br/>
unschooling it&#39;s easy to get unfooding and the other unparenting <br/>
things, but it still takes awhile to get totally comfortable with <br/>
it.  Unfooding doesn&#39;t sound like quite the right word for it, does <br/>
it?  Unfooders still eat food! lol Just like you wouldn&#39;t call an <br/>
unschooler and unlearner.  But anyway...<br/>
<br/>
Some days I&#39;ve been impressed and some days I&#39;m not.  Like today, my <br/>
three year old had nilla wafers for breakfast, meatballs in spaghetti <br/>
sauce and 1/2 a hot dog for lunch, and a grilled cheese sandwich with <br/>
tomato and onion for supper.  He still drinks nothing but soda.  My <br/>
five year old had nilla wafers for breakfast and didn&#39;t eat lunch.  <br/>
He ate a toasted cheese (just cheese and bread) for supper and at <br/>
night had a snack of leftover hamburg and potatos.  He drank sunny <br/>
delight all day.  I&#39;m not sure what my 9 year old ate for breakfast <br/>
and lunch, but she had a toasted cheese for supper and hamburg and <br/>
potatos for a bedtime snack.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m learning to relax, which is good.  The biggest area that needs <br/>
improvement is my modelling of good food choices.  I struggle with <br/>
eating well.</div>
