<div id="ygrps-yiv-1441042567">Greetings fello homeschoolers,<br/>
I have to vent to someone, I thought this is a good, safe place to <br/>
find some understanding women.<br/>
 <br/>
Once again, I was faced with a situation that labeled me as a <br/>
homemaker. But, what I really mean is someone basically saying &quot;Just <br/>
a homemaker.&quot; I hope what I&#39;m saying makes sense. I hate it when <br/>
someone asks me &quot;What do you do?&quot; And then when I give the <br/>
answer, &quot;Homeschooling Mom,&quot; or &quot;Homemaker,&quot; I am given that look and <br/>
then a fake reply of &quot;That&#39;s nice...&quot; Usually, because this person is <br/>
working behind a counter when they ask. I have to add here though, I <br/>
have just recently run into more and more women who honestly say <br/>
positive things like, &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t blame you for homeschooling&quot;, <br/>
or &quot;I would do the same if I didn&#39;t have to work,&quot; so times are <br/>
changing! Still,  I&#39;m fed up with people making me feel like I&#39;m no <br/>
one because I don&#39;t have a working title after my name! <br/>
 <br/>
When we sat down at the table at the Title company to sign on our new <br/>
house, we found out that the mortgage broker (who up to this point we <br/>
only communicated with over the phone) had planned the mortgage in my <br/>
dh&#39;s name, only. We always put both names on the mortgage, and I was <br/>
angry. Mark had done all the talking with him except for one phone <br/>
call that I made and he was very condescending to me, almost <br/>
sarcastic. The title company woman called him to see why only Marks <br/>
name was on the documents, and he said he assumed because Mark was <br/>
the sole provider, and the one he always spoke with, the mortgage was <br/>
to be in his name!  UGH!!! Oh, I see, because I don&#39;t punch a clock, <br/>
and have a respectable title to put in the occupation box, I&#39;m <br/>
NOBODY! I have been upset over this ever since. Now we have to go <br/>
through the trouble of a quit-claim deed to get my name on the house! <br/>
I&#39;m am so livid!  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve paid my dues. I worked and went to college when my firstborn was <br/>
growing up. I landed that great corporate job, that society tried to <br/>
made me think was so important. All I ended up feeling was guilty for <br/>
having to work when all I wanted to do was be there for my daughter. <br/>
I&#39;m not knocking women who work and do it all, I&#39;ve been there, I <br/>
know it&#39;s do-able, and I&#39;m jealous that you have that little by-line <br/>
after your name: secretary, supervisor...<br/>
 <br/>
But, why isn&#39;t it just as respectable to say I&#39;m a homemaker, mother, <br/>
homeschool teacher? I want some credit!! Why, when asked, what we <br/>
do,  can&#39;t we say &quot;I&#39;m my kids Mom,&quot; as Dr. Laura says, and that <br/>
answer bring on some sort of &quot;Ahh, what a great job,&quot; with a look of <br/>
respect and appreciation on the askers face? What in the heck has <br/>
happened in our society that we, the homemakers, home teachers, <br/>
wives, and mothers have become so disrespected? Just fifty years ago, <br/>
if you were a homemaker, you were respected for the work you did, it <br/>
was, indeed a job, one of the most important jobs. Now society&#39;s <br/>
attitude is one that believes anyone can make a home and raise kids. <br/>
It&#39;s a real woman who can keep house, raise kids and hold a job, so, <br/>
if &quot;all you do&quot; is raise your kids, then you are looked upon as if <br/>
you have no skills, or intelligence. <br/>
 <br/>
I think I&#39;ll send Mr. Mortgage Man a letter telling him, I am not <br/>
just a stay-at-home Mom, I&#39;m a crusader! I&#39;m working every day from <br/>
the moment my feet touch the floor until the second my head hits the <br/>
pillow, and then sometimes a few times during those supposed sleeping <br/>
hours. I work every minute of every day, with no government <br/>
regulated, mandatory coffee breaks, no sick days, no weekends, no <br/>
holidays off. And, contrary to popular belief, my job doesn&#39;t just <br/>
consist of dishing out macaroni and cheese and wiping noses. My job <br/>
requires I think before I speak, always. I must research constantly <br/>
because I am not given a set of rules that, if followed, will keep me <br/>
moving up the company ladder. I&#39;m given a barrage of information from <br/>
all different sources and it&#39;s up to me to decide what is right for <br/>
my family, and what is wrong. I must decide how to guide my children <br/>
morally and ethically while not sheltering them too much from the <br/>
craziness this world has become. Stress? Well, my job has it&#39;s fair <br/>
share. The difference is, I can&#39;t leave it all and come home each <br/>
day. It&#39;s with me constantly as I lay in bed exhausted and wondering <br/>
if I made the right decisions with each day. I&#39;ve accepted the <br/>
horrendous, slave-like, working conditions because I know the deeper <br/>
reasons for taking this job. This job that has no accountability in <br/>
society&#39;s eyes. This job with no paycheck. I&#39;m working to put a dent <br/>
in society, help to change it for the better. I&#39;m working to create <br/>
children who one day will be adults that are capable, well rounded, <br/>
and strong. Adults who will feel confident, loved and compassionate <br/>
about what they believe in. Adults who have real moral values. Adults <br/>
who aren&#39;t afraid to work hard to achieve what they want, and who <br/>
understand working hard is honorable. I&#39;m working to change society, <br/>
and hopefully, as my husband said, I&#39;m one of the few in the spear <br/>
head, piercing through this mess that has become accepted as normal <br/>
in our society. One of the few who have taken my job seriously, very <br/>
seriously. I&#39;m a spear head. My job is creating a future, better <br/>
world. It is unfortunate, that people like you, Mr. Mortgage Man, <br/>
cannot see farther than your upcoming weekend party, I will keep you <br/>
in mind as I teach my children...<br/>

Are you sure?<br/>
<br/>
IS there credit?   Points?  Stars?<br/>
<br/>
If you were a highly paid stripper or tattoo artist would you be proud to put <br/>
that down?<br/>
<br/>
There is being paid, and there is being respected, and there is also lack of <br/>
confidence.<br/>
<br/>
I sure hope it&#39;s not costing you one PENNY to get the deed changed, and maybe <br/>
you should ask them for compensation (at least a nice free lunch somewhere <br/>
fancy).<br/>

I use &quot;Homeschooling mother at home&quot; sometimes, on forms.  Or you could say <br/>
&quot;self employeed.&quot;<br/>

Fifty years ago there was a huge propaganda push to get women out of the <br/>
factory jobs so the returning GIs could get off unemployment.  It was a <br/>

jazzy new tract houses in the new and still tree-free suburbs.<br/>

Hi, Robin --<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think so.  I think people doing jobs for zero or low paychecks<br/>
are not and have never been respected in our money-centric culture. <br/>
Women were EXPECTED to stay home, but their work wasn&#39;t much valued or<br/>
admired,  in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
I started reading Ms. magazine about thirty years ago, when the first<br/>
issue was published.  There were lots of quoted media examples about the<br/>
childishness and incompetence of women.  Jokes about women being<br/>
terrible drivers used to be common.<br/>
<br/>
That aside, we&#39;re buying a house, too.  I just filled out the form<br/>
yesterday that showed that I hadn&#39;t held a job in 10 years.  (Silver<br/>
lining -- I could fill the form out quickly!)<br/>
<br/>
I would be livid if my name wasn&#39;t on the deed.<br/>

&lt;&lt;My dh is self employed, but it works for him because he has the income to <br/>
back it up!  &gt;&gt;<br/>

That just means he pays himself better than you do.<br/>

This is a quote from <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hrmguide.co.uk/hrm/chap2/ch2-">http://www.hrmguide.co.uk/hrm/chap2/ch2-</a><br/>

<br/>
&quot;Human capital. Personal and national success are increasingly <br/>
correlated with the possession of skills. Skilled individuals can <br/>
command a premium salary in periods of high economic activity. <br/>
Worldwide, unemployment levels remain high, while organizations have <br/>
difficulty filling vacancies which require specific expertise. A <br/>
shortage of skilled people can act as a limiting factor on <br/>
individual organizations and the economy as a whole. It is in the <br/>
interest of any country to maximise its human resources by investing <br/>
in the skills of its workforce, its human capital.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
And, it will confuse the hell out of the idiots at the mortgage <br/>
company.  <br/>
