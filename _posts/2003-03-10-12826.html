&gt; South <br/>
&gt; Carolina is the &quot;Fighting Gamecocks&quot;, &quot;&#39;Cocks&quot; for short. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She said her husband REALLY needed one of those bumper stickers. I need to <br/>
&gt; get on the ball and buy one for her. I&#39;m looking for the one that says, &quot;No <br/>

Comes First in Girl Scouts.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I always pictured a marketing committee coming up with that, then making <br/>
thousands of teeshirts, buttons, and pencils....  They&#39;re sent out, opened at <br/>
GS council stores across the country.... Then the giggling starts.<br/>
<br/>
I have a button. They&#39;re rare now. I still think it&#39;s a great marketing <br/>
theme.<br/>

P.S. Hey....did you know there&#39;s a Hello Kitty vibrator available?<br/>

I have a PowerPuff Girls waffle iron!<br/>
<br/>
(NOT a sex toy.)<br/>
<br/>
I have a crazed friend who used to, if things got boring, turn anything into <br/>
&quot;sex toy/ not a sex toy.&quot;    For his birthday I got a little hand-size <br/>
paperback, fat, something like &quot;2000 Things to Make You Smile&quot; (some little <br/>
giftie book) and made a paper cover for it and glued it on all <br/>
original-looking-like, and on the spine and cover it said &quot;Sex Toy / Not a <br/>
Sex Toy&quot; and it was the party game and a great bathroom book for year.<br/>
<br/>
So, you have a website for this Japanese electronics device of which you <br/>
speak?  I don&#39;t want to have to go to the anime section at Castle Superstore <br/>
to see it.  I have some dignity left.  A little.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1931856898">Wow.....I signed up for this group recently to learn more about unschooling.  But now that s-e-x is the topic, I&#39;m eager to join in with my 2 cents.<br/>
<br/>
1) My parents went to Carolina.  My 3 brothers & I grew up with &quot;Go Cocks&quot;.  Nothing gets my parents more excited.<br/>
<br/>
2) Hello Kitty Vibrator??  When my husband & I were in Singapore, we saw Hello Kitty EVERYWHERE.  I&#39;m not kidding, if it could be sold, it had Hello Kitty on it.  So this doesn&#39;t surprise me.<br/>
<br/>
And at one point in my early 20&#39;s, I wanted to be a sex therapist.  I often wonder, where I would be now, if I was unschooled!?!?!  <br/>
