<div id="ygrps-yiv-1506364574">hello, <br/>
Im a newish member of this list...<br/>
Just in case, I have 7 children, and I am unschooling my dd5 who is 8 years in May.<br/>
<br/>
the older children are all schooled, but with as &quot;unschooly&quot; an attitude as possible, from <br/>
our side at anyrate.  All are free to leave when they wish.  They just arent wishing to yet. <br/>
<br/>
My concerns right now, are about protecting my daughter&#39;s learning.  <br/>
<br/>
I have just come away from a conversation with the principal of the local school, which <br/>
buroucratically speaking is not &quot;just&quot; a principal. In Italy,  the principal is the director  of <br/>
the whole area&#39;s schools...<br/>
<br/>
Last year&#39;s &quot;director&quot; had given me the information that testing a homeschooled child was <br/>
only required upon re-entry of the public school system.  <br/>
<br/>
This year&#39;s principal or &quot;director&quot; has come up with the &quot;normative&quot; (legislature?) that tells <br/>
me that I must test my child each year.  Now if I were in the US I would not at all be <br/>
concerned but I am rather worried about the impact (on dd) of taking the sort of test they <br/>
give here in italy. I also am having trouble separating my own fears from what actually *is* <br/>
or may be...<br/>
<br/>
I could write tons to give background, but I have two littlies that are begging for the <br/>
computer back...I would prefer to be asked questions to help me thru this situation.<br/>
<br/>
I have been requested to provide what I guess is &quot;curriculum&quot; ( una programma) that is <br/>
ideona to a 2nd grader.  I have translated Sandra&#39;s page that talks about this ( I will pass <br/>
that on to you, sandra, as soon as it is completely smoothed out)...Thankyou for that page, <br/>
it was such a life saver for me.  Yet, I need to work out what I have actually done with her <br/>
as they will be basing the &quot;exam&quot; on &quot;my program&quot;...<br/>
<br/>
Im full of fear, and excited as well. I really want to do this right, by my dd, but also for <br/>
others that may follow me...I know my oldest dd  (lucia 20.5yrs) who just read today the <br/>
Unschooling UnManual, and called me to say that she plans to unschool her children.<br/>
:o)<br/>
I know if she says that, she will.<br/>
<br/>
Ive posted elsewhere about a month ago about my worries of &quot;ruining&quot; my dd&#39;s learning <br/>
(unschooled) but no one gave me a response (no, thats not true,- one woman asked for <br/>
clarification but didnt respond afterwards)...<br/>
<br/>
having a bit of trouble expressing myself, its hard to move back into english today for <br/>
some reason....sorry if this is choppy..<br/>
okay  ive really got to go,<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, if this is not the right place to post this, let me know and I will go there. But I do <br/>
want to go where you will be answering, lol.<br/>
<br/>
thank you so much for everything past present and future,<br/>

<br/>
That is, protecting the unschooled learning when testing by grade level is involved...<br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>
