<br/>
It’s a mainstream article about how some parents are being shamed by childless friends, or older people or random strangers, for letting their kids watch TV or play with “screens.”<br/>
<br/>
I smiled through it.   I was amused. :-)<br/>
<br/>
And there will be things there in the defense that are still kind of cowardly and tentative by unschooling standards. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I think the “paper time” and “cloth time” arguments could be good, for someone with the confidence enough to present them.  Or Joyce’s “Door stuff” example.<br/>

Also, this week, someone showed me a cartoon and said it seemed plagiarism, but I think the term “paper time” can / will / must arise spontaneously in LOTS of people who see the tacky irony of lumping all “screentime” together while taking pride in writing paper checks and reading paper magazines and having a library card.  <br/>

For anyone new here, there are many happy things on my site about the avoidance of the use (or thought) “screentime”:<br/>
