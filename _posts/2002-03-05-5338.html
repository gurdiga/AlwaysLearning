<div id="ygrps-yiv-260100271">I finally got around to uploading some photos of our family that I <br/>
had hanging around in our computer.  One is of Tom and I, taken a few <br/>
years ago, and there is also one of each of my boys that is about a <br/>
year old.  Sorry I don&#39;t have anything more recent.<br/>
<br/>
In other events:  We have found a property/community that we are <br/>
moving to later this spring for intentional community, for those of <br/>
you who were following our odyssey towards that goal.  It is on the <br/>
Olympic Penninsula near Port Townsend, WA, and we hope to be there <br/>
before summer, or just as soon as we can get ourselves moved.  Tom <br/>
will be commuting for a while, staying with family near his job <br/>
during the week and spending extended weekends (every Friday off) <br/>
with us at the farm 4.5 hours away.  His contract with his current <br/>
employer is up at the end of this summer-beginning of fall, at which <br/>
time he will look for closer work to where we will be.<br/>
<br/>
We are nervous, excited and anxious to finally be making the move.  <br/>
We are following our dreams and taking risks in this, not doing the <br/>
expected thing and staying where we are financially safe in the life <br/>
that we know.  <br/>
