<div id="ygrps-yiv-675464383">I was also curious how you handled cussing? I do not swear, and I<br/>
would like my children not to swear, or at least not until they are<br/>
older and know when it is not respectful to other people. I understand<br/>
that in the real world people use these words, but I DO get offended<br/>
(maybe I shouldn&#39;t - I&#39;ve just always felt it showed a lack of<br/>
vocabulary, which I tend to have, ironically...)<br/>
<br/>
When in books or in movies, I just tend to ignore the language. So I&#39;m<br/>
not stuck-up about it, just prefer not to use it here at home or in<br/>
most public places around people.<br/>
<br/>
For now I&#39;ve just told the kids that there are some words that aren&#39;t<br/>
nice to say, and leave it at that. They haven&#39;t asked or anything...<br/>

<br/>
Thing is my kids seldom curse and never at the wrong time. Ive never really given them a lecture on the topic or anything heh i guess they have just watched me. <br/>
<br/>
For example the other day one of kid dropped their plate of food on the floor and said ah sh**. I have never heard them utter a curse or anything that might be remotely offfensive in front of grandma, out in public, etc. <br/>
<br/>
For me, I have to trust them to learn this just as i trust them to learn anything else. Yes they might make a mistake but mistakes are part of life. <br/>

  ********My 6 yr old swears, first of all I do use strong language on occasion because sometime it&#39;s appropriate. He learned several words from the music he likes, he is also very interested in ratings of movies and video games. He knows all the ratings and he knows why they are rated that way. He even makes up his own games and rates them accordingly, blood, violence, language etc. <br/>
<br/>
  On this topic he has learned so much that I don&#39;t want to discount his desire to know this information. We have talked about the words and how some people are offended and where they aren&#39;t appropriate etc. I believe that he understands because he only does it at home. I do have a slight fear that he might slip up around other children whose parents would flip but so far so good. He even beeps himself out, it&#39;s quite comical actually.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;ll grow out of it and move on to his next interest so we aren&#39;t giving it extra attention just talk about it as we go.<br/>
<br/>
  Words are just words until someone gives them power, I don&#39;t believe there are bad words just words given too much attention by our society. <br/>

The first step is to recognize that they&#39;re separate people. And your  <br/>
unschooling job is to help them be who they are not who you want them  <br/>
to be.<br/>
<br/>
That said, unless your husband swears or they&#39;re regularly around  <br/>
other people they like who swear, it&#39;s not likely they will while  <br/>
they&#39;re young.<br/>
<br/>
But if they do, kids don&#39;t naturally want to hurt others so we can  <br/>
help them by passing on tips on appropriate places to use swears if  <br/>
they&#39;re not catching on. I wouldn&#39;t immediately assume that they  <br/>
don&#39;t understand as soon as you hear a swear. My daughter liked to  <br/>
eat sprawled across the table when she was little, but she never did  <br/>
it at other people&#39;s houses or restaurants. ;-) Most kids can pick up  <br/>
social clues just by living life :-)<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Two points about that:<br/>
<br/>
Your house is part of the real world.<br/>
<br/>
and<br/>
<br/>
Did you &quot;fell&quot; it showed a lack of vocabulary, or have you heard that  <br/>
and internalized it and repeated it?<br/>
<br/>
-=-For now I&#39;ve just told the kids that there are some words that  <br/>
aren&#39;t nice to say, and leave it at that. They haven&#39;t asked or  <br/>
anything...-=-<br/>
<br/>
Between now and when they ask, you have time to examine your beliefs  <br/>
and feelings, and as you move more into principles, it will make it  <br/>
easier to figure out when the time comes (if it does) how to handle  <br/>
the next phase.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Cussing&quot; is a term for &quot;cursing,&quot; which has to do with the power of  <br/>
words to condemn people, or the meanness  and hubris (sin of thinking  <br/>
you have power or importance) of telling someone you hope they burn  <br/>
in hellfire, or even the shortened version of &quot;go to hell&quot; or the  <br/>
older &quot;damn you&quot; which is short for &quot;May God damn  you to hell.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So those are strong words.  Those are curses.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You&#39;re a son of a bitch&quot; isn&#39;t a curse, it&#39;s just an insult.  But  <br/>
somewhere in the past few centuries in the U.S., at least, they were  <br/>
generalized to &quot;cussing&quot; and condemned along with native Anglo-Saxon  <br/>
non-medical terms involving anything sexual or scatological.<br/>
<br/>
I think someone who doesn&#39;t say much more than &quot;Shit&quot; and &quot;Dude&quot;  <br/>
might be displaying a lack of vocabulary, but someone who knows six  <br/>
synonyms for &quot;vagina&quot; and fifteen for &quot;penis&quot; can&#39;t possibly be  <br/>
accused of a small vocabulary.<br/>
<br/>
The trick then is the awareness of appropriate times and places to  <br/>
use those words, and when it&#39;s not courteous.<br/>
<br/>
It has to do with courtesy, discretion, choices, mindfulness--all the  <br/>
good stuff.<br/>

<br/>
Ah!  Swearing.  That&#39;s another thing &quot;we&quot; don&#39;t do because the Bible  <br/>
says not to.  I think the U.S. has a puritanical take on language  <br/>
that not all English-speaking places have.<br/>
<br/>
The rule against swearing has to do with not getting God involved in  <br/>
your oaths, or not taking ownership of the universe as though it&#39;s  <br/>
yours to gamble away, as though you own it.  Few people think of it  <br/>
that way, as what principles are behind it.  Maybe nobody does but  <br/>
me, now that I think of it, but when I was little and sitting in  <br/>
church (First Baptist, Espaï¿½ola, New Mexico, Brother James Cathey,  <br/>
Minister [most of those years]), I thought WHY would the Bible say  <br/>
not to swear by any thing?<br/>
<br/>
Matthew 5:34<br/>
But I tell you, Do not swear at all: either by heaven, for it is  <br/>
God&#39;s throne;<br/>
Matthew 5:33-35 (in Context) Matthew 5 (Whole Chapter)<br/>
Matthew 23:22<br/>
And he who swears by heaven swears by God&#39;s throne and by the one who  <br/>
sits on it.<br/>
Matthew 23:21-23 (in Context) Matthew 23 (Whole Chapter)<br/>
James 5:12<br/>
Above all, my brothers, do not swearï¿½not by heaven or by earth or by  <br/>
anything else. Let your &quot;Yes&quot; be yes, and your &quot;No,&quot; no, or you will  <br/>
be condemned.<br/>
James 5:11-13 (in Context) James 5 (Whole Chapter)<br/>
So that&#39;s the New Testament.  Genesis has all kinds of swearing oaths  <br/>
before God.  So stuff changes, even in the Bible.  (Yeah don&#39;t say  <br/>
THAT in a Baptist church.)<br/>
<br/>
So cussing and swearing are two different things and neither one  <br/>
involves the use of &quot;the f word&quot; nor any words for poop.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1399805317">Huh.  I&#39;ve never heard the distinction between taking oaths (swearing) and<br/>
cussing (cursing).  Good one.<br/>
<br/>
Judgment is mighty close to cursing, as is praying (sometimes...  &quot;may my<br/>
enemies die as the dogs -- don&#39;t let the bad guys win&quot; kind of prayer, we<br/>
know those, right?).<br/>
<br/>
Swearing/ vowing can perhaps be seen as an extended more outright version of<br/>
cursing.  Personally controlling the outcome of lots of things and taking on<br/>
the mantle of enormous responsibilities.  When people get married,<br/>
traditionally that&#39;s an oath.  Commending newborns to a godly upbringing.<br/>
Taking the office of doctor, lawyer or president.  Being knighted?  The use<br/>
of power often involves swearing.  Kinda like cursing yourself... I swear<br/>
before present company to xyz so help me God (because if I screw up now...<br/>
I&#39;m guilty not just to you present company but also to all of heaven).  Just<br/>
to up the ante some more.<br/>

<br/>
But a vow takes the curse onto the speaker, not onto the other guy.   <br/>
&quot;May Allah smite me&quot; or &quot;I swear by God and all things holy,&quot; it  <br/>
means I&#39;m so sure of what I&#39;m claiming that I have no fear of God, or  <br/>
that this is so important that if I fail to do it, I&#39;m willing to go  <br/>
to hell for it.<br/>
<br/>
The use of power involves swearing, like an oath of office (lawyers  <br/>
take oaths as officers of the court, at least where I live), and  <br/>
those are so that other people can oust a guy who is forsworn (who  <br/>
breaks his oath).   It&#39;s the difference between dodging or fibbing or  <br/>
lying (saying things that are somewhere between slightly and totally  <br/>
false) and plagiarism (saying ANYthing false when under oath).<br/>
<br/>
But if a guy is saying &quot;I swear before God and all these witnesses  <br/>
that...&quot; and then he tells a lie, he&#39;s bringing God into his  <br/>
bullshit, and so I think that&#39;s why the early Christians were against  <br/>
it.  It&#39;s a form of taking the lord&#39;s name in vain.  It&#39;s misusing God.<br/>

&gt; at least not until they are older ...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve seen this line of reasoning before, and I&#39;m not sure I completely<br/>
see the logic of this argument. For example:<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t smoke and I would like my children not to smoke...<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t drink and drive, and I would like my children not to drink and<br/>
drive...<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t play the choking game, and I would like my children not to<br/>
play the choking game...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I understand these aren&#39;t the same, but my point is that there ARE<br/>
some things I think fall under the category of &quot;moral&quot; and how we<br/>
choose to define it. And each family will have a different set of<br/>
values, regardless of what they are, which they will naturally pass<br/>
down to their children.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe rude or vulgar or &quot;colorful&quot; language doesn&#39;t fall under this<br/>
category, but I still think the above example as an argument for the<br/>
silliness of my statement doesn&#39;t always hold up, is all.<br/>
<br/>
THIS is the hardest part of whole-life unschooling for me - the line<br/>
between moral and &quot;non-moral&quot; (is there a word for this?) things. I<br/>
don&#39;t have a problem with my children choosing things that fall out of<br/>
the range of our moral values, but I DO want to pass on our moral<br/>
values to them. Whether they claim them as their own as adults is up<br/>
to them, but I believe they will pick up moral values from SOMEWHERE,<br/>
and it might as well be us. I know some things are culturally<br/>
oriented, as in nudity. Maybe in some &quot;primitive&quot; cultures a naked 10<br/>
year old wouldn&#39;t cause any heads to turn, but here in America it<br/>
would land me in jail. Some things aren&#39;t immoral, just rude (burping<br/>
or farting in public, raising the middle finger, and I think vulgarity<br/>
would fall in this category.)<br/>
<br/>
Either way, this is the part I get confused about. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s<br/>
wrong to pass our morals on...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-38642772">Moral decisions are not the same as decisions about risk behaviors.<br/>
<br/>
The following are about the risk of death or injury.  Risk is the reason for<br/>
any laws against them:<br/>
<br/>
Smoking<br/>
Drinking/driving<br/>
Playing choking games<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s waaaayy less of a connection between risk and sugar, and saying<br/>
people could die or get sick (other than a tummy ache) from eating sugar is<br/>
going to sound extremely far fetched to our kids.<br/>
<br/>
And anyway.... typically by the time our children are old enough to be<br/>
interested in the riskiest choices (in the tweens and teens), a whole lot of<br/>
childhood has gone by.<br/>
<br/>
And each family will have a different set of<br/>
values, regardless of what they are, which they will naturally pass<br/>
down to their children.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no guarantee.  Morals are not like heredity (which is also difficult<br/>
to predict).  Moral living won&#39;t produce kids who won&#39;t ever smoke, drink,<br/>
eat sugar, play choking games, etc, etc, etc.  We can&#39;t help but exhibit the<br/>
values we truly believe in (regardless of the values we may *espouse*<br/>
--mindful parenting means becoming conscious of the disparities between<br/>
those two sets of values).  There are *no guarantees* our kids will believe<br/>
the same things we do since their experience will likely be different from<br/>
ours.<br/>
<br/>
Mostly we&#39;ll have tons of opportunities to influence our kids by living the<br/>
life and the values we believe in.<br/>
Kids tend to emulate the values their parents live by (by dent of the fact<br/>
that it&#39;s what they know).<br/>
Even as much as I resisted my parent&#39;s consistent attempts to control my<br/>
choices  ....<br/>
Even though I went as far in the opposite direction as I could (somewhat too<br/>
far in many cases) ....<br/>
I managed to believe many of the same things my parents believe.<br/>
I&#39;<br/>
ve made many of the same decisions *and* I&#39;ve made some very different<br/>
decisions.<br/>
My morals are not a carbon copy of my parent&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
There are no guarantees.<br/>
<br/>
Thus enabling our children to make decisions as early as possible is a<br/>
strategy for having influence for the better part of their lives.  The later<br/>
we wait to &quot;let&quot; our children decide things for themselves, moral or<br/>
otherwise, the more likely we *guarantee* that our influence won&#39;t have the<br/>
effect we could wish.<br/>

or killing someone or ...?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s part of the same fabric, really, as not wanting them to eat sugar.<br/>
<br/>
Probably the best way to up the chances of them doing something is to  <br/>
forbid it! But that doesn&#39;t mean, then, let them do it. What it means  <br/>
is turning your thinking to a totally different way of being with  <br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
Live your values because that&#39;s what&#39;s important to you. Make those  <br/>
values accessible and easy for your kids to explore. Trust that  <br/>
they&#39;re thinking creatures and can learn by living and thinking and  <br/>
sometimes trying things out. Be there to pass on information. But  <br/>
leave the decision up to them.<br/>
<br/>
Someone was asked how she got her kids to like broccoli. She answered  <br/>
by not doing anything to make her kids dislike broccoli.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Maybe in some &quot;primitive&quot; cultures a naked 10<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But that&#39;s not a moral issue. It&#39;s a legal issue. And it wouldn&#39;t be  <br/>
fair to kids not to let them know that they or their parents could  <br/>
get in trouble if they do something that&#39;s illegal. Their actions  <br/>
could have an impact on the whole family.<br/>
<br/>
But that isn&#39;t the same as &quot;I won&#39;t let you.&quot; It&#39;s information to  <br/>
help the child decide. And it&#39;s *much* easier when they&#39;re younger  <br/>
and they&#39;re faced with a decision about riding with or without a   <br/>
helmet rather than drinking and driving.<br/>
<br/>
Conventional families will picture kids, especially teens, who would  <br/>
shrug when told the consequences because the kids don&#39;t care. And  <br/>
that&#39;s a huge clue that something&#39;s wrong! It&#39;s not natural for kids  <br/>
to not care about hurting their family. The reason that  <br/>
conventionally parented kids can come to not care is because, from  <br/>
their point of view, the parents don&#39;t care. From day one the parents  <br/>
have been saying essentially, &quot;I won&#39;t like you unless you do what I  <br/>
think is best.&quot; They don&#39;t mean to say that! But by deciding what the  <br/>
child may and may not choose, they *are* saying that.<br/>
<br/>
If kids feelings are treated as though they matter, then they treat  <br/>
our feelings as though they matter (as they&#39;re able). Unschoolers  <br/>
probably have the least incidence of teen rebellion. ;-) When kids  <br/>
know their parents are on their side to help them figure out life,  <br/>
there isn&#39;t a reason to rebel.<br/>
<br/>
I know this probably seems like a total side issue, but just about  <br/>
everything about unschooling comes back to treating kids with  <br/>
respect, as though they&#39;re intelligent beings who can figure this out  <br/>
with us by their sides as a resource rather than a control gate.<br/>

think the kids might not have considered. I have tried their whole  <br/>
lives NOT to tell them things they already knew because that seemed to  <br/>
me to be a great way to get them to stop paying attention to what I  <br/>
said.<br/>
<br/>
It IS natural for young people to assess risks differently than older  <br/>
people - that&#39;s a biological fact of brain development.<br/>
<br/>
If you live an analytical life in which you examine the reasons for  <br/>
and the consequences of decisions (your own, acquaintances, friends  <br/>
and family, people on tv or in books or movies), then the kids will  <br/>
develop their analytical abilities and they&#39;ll apply them, to some  <br/>
degree, when the decisions are major ones.<br/>
<br/>
One example I&#39;ve seen has been my kids carefully considering who to  <br/>
get in a car with, as their friends have started driving. They pretty  <br/>
much decided absolutely NO getting on the freeway with any newish  <br/>
drivers - not in the first year or so of them starting to drive. And  <br/>
they only ride with newly licensed drivers for short distances and not  <br/>
ever with a big group of kids, only if it is just driver and one  <br/>
passenger. These are decisions my kids made, each in their own time,  <br/>
and I never ever once controlled who they rode with. Rosie, especially  <br/>
has a lot of older friends and so they were all getting their driving  <br/>
licenses when she was still 14, 15, 16 - she&#39;s now 17. She was  <br/>
absolutely up front with them - &quot;No, sorry, I don&#39;t ride with new  <br/>
drivers until they&#39;ve had a lot of experience.&quot; Blunt. Clear.  <br/>
Confident in her own choice.<br/>

<br/>
Doesn&#39;t that sound like some kind of zen Buddhist thing?<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s the deal.  If you treat broccoli as a bad thing or a good  <br/>
thing, you take away your child&#39;s opportunity to make a clear, good  <br/>
choice.<br/>
<br/>
If she sees you eat it without making a big deal about it, she might  <br/>
want to eat it.<br/>
<br/>
If she sees you eat it and you&#39;re making a show about &#39;ooh how good&quot;  <br/>
it is and &quot;yum, yum&quot; and that, she could think you&#39;re being  <br/>
manipulative.  If she does, good.  She&#39;s smart.<br/>
<br/>
And parents should know and remember that some foods, like brocolli,  <br/>
have a bitterness that little kids don&#39;t like as well as they might  <br/>
when their tastes change.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes people say &quot;Children&#39;s tastebuds are immature,&quot; implying  <br/>
adults are the good and right stage of human life, but children  <br/>
aren&#39;t quite real yet.  Maybe children are the right way, and adults  <br/>
are living more by rules and charts than their own instincts.   But  <br/>
it&#39;s clearly true that there are things children like a lot that  <br/>
adults don&#39;t love as much.  It&#39;s very likely that there are instincts  <br/>
at play, and that children&#39;s nutritional needs are different than  <br/>
adults.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I could go on and on about that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But this is at the core of living well with children:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1781151089">-=-I don&#39;t smoke and I would like my children not to smoke...<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t drink and drive, and I would like my children not to drink and<br/>
drive...<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t play the choking game, and I would like my children not to<br/>
play the choking game...-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ARE there adults around you playing the choking game?  If it&#39;s a kids- <br/>
at-school thing, and your kids aren&#39;t at school, how likely is it?     <br/>
We used to hold people tightly from the back so they would pass out,  <br/>
at school.  Maybe it&#39;s similar.  They were all volunteers; they did  <br/>
it to me once.  We got yelled at by the band teacher.  They had LOTS  <br/>
of rules about things we could NOT do, but didn&#39;t provide cool ideas  <br/>
about what we could do.  Either we did what the teachers said to do  <br/>
exactly, or we got creative and did something on our own, or we  <br/>
purposely did NOT do what they said to do, but in all that mess of  <br/>
rules, children&#39;s rights and individuality get distorted.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So.<br/>
<br/>
Back to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Would children be more or less likely to smoke if a parent smokes?   <br/>
I&#39;m not talking statistics, but children and parents.  My parents  <br/>
smoked and I experienced them telling me &quot;no&quot; when I wanted a record  <br/>
player or new shoes or to go to some camp or event, because we  <br/>
couldn&#39;t afford it.  I knew cigarettes cost a lot of money and they  <br/>
were being unfair.  So I didn&#39;t want to smoke because it was stinky  <br/>
and expensive and seemed to cause parents to hold out on kids and to  <br/>
be selfish.<br/>
<br/>
Would children be more or less likely to smoke if a parent doesn&#39;t  <br/>
smoke?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking it could depend on how they feel about that parent&#39;s  <br/>
integrity and whether they want to be more like the parent, or less  <br/>
like the parent.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My kids  drink sometimes, but they have always had clear permission  <br/>
and encouragement to stay where they are for the night, or to leave  <br/>
our car there and get a ride from someone very sober and we&#39;ll get  <br/>
the car the next day.<br/>
<br/>
Drinking and driving often comes from rules about being home by a  <br/>
certain time &quot;or else.&quot;   Else was supposed to be the kid got in  <br/>
trouble, but very many times it has ended up being the kid didn&#39;t get  <br/>
home at all, or someone else didn&#39;t ever get home at all, or the kid  <br/>
got home later after a hospital stay and never needed to borrow the  <br/>
car again.<br/>
<br/>
If my husband went out drinking, I would rather he would stay where  <br/>
he was than get home to pretend he hadn&#39;t been drinking.  If I care  <br/>
more about safety and honesty than about getting my way, and if he  <br/>
has no reason to lie or be sneaky, that&#39;s better for him and me, and  <br/>
so for us, and so for our children.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Last Saturday Keith and Marty both drank, but they were camping and  <br/>
they drank and then walked over and went to sleep.  Marty WANTED to  <br/>
be where his dad was.  Had Keith said &quot;NO DRINKING,&quot; Marty wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
have wanted to hang around and watch his dad drink, and he might have  <br/>
wanted to go where others were letting him.<br/>
<br/>
Usually Keith doesn&#39;t drink, so that&#39;s easy.<br/>
<br/>
Marty had wanted to go to this weekend campout, but work wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
give him the weekend off.  So he drove 50 miles there and 50 miles  <br/>
back, went to work, drove back out there (paying for his own  <br/>
gas)...      To go where his dad was.<br/>
<br/>
If your priorities are love and thought and finding ways to make  <br/>
things work, you won&#39;t have to have a bunch of rules nor to sort out  <br/>
the moral things from the immoral things.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Relationships are what makes breaks situations.  Parents need to see  <br/>
to their own morality.  Compassion and honesty and generosity will  <br/>
help your kids more than telling them what to do and what not to do.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Chamille&#39;s friend is finally un-grounded from her and available.  At<br/>
first we were really excited about that, but all the punishment and<br/>
banning and crazy control has had a way bigger effect on her than we<br/>
realized.  Many years of smaller control and manipulation and one year<br/>
of really harsh control and manipulation.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly she&#39;s free and she doesn&#39;t know how to behave herself.  She&#39;s<br/>
clearly rebelling hardcore to all that stuff and it shows in her<br/>
choices.<br/>
<br/>
There are some not so nice teen boys that live in our neighborhood and<br/>
when they were walking past, some words were said and the friend went a<br/>
little overboard.  When Chamille told me about it later I asked her why<br/>
she would behave that way and say those things.  She said that she<br/>
didn&#39;t and she couldn&#39;t get her friend to stop and it actually bothered<br/>
her.  Wether or not she liked the boys was irrelevant, it was more the<br/>
fact that running around the neighborhood behaving poorly bothered her. <br/>
We do have other neighbors that she would like to continue having a good<br/>
relationship with and running around loudly cussing isn&#39;t going to do<br/>
anything to help that.<br/>
<br/>
Chamille can see the difference, she can make good judgement calls.  For<br/>
a kid who&#39;s never been allowed to make any kind of judgement for<br/>
herself, she&#39;s not going to be discriminate in her decisions to rebel. <br/>
For her, it&#39;s all fair game.  The reality for Chamille, is that it&#39;s not<br/>
all fair game.  Getting kicked out of the mall for make-up is one thing,<br/>
getting kicked out of the mall because you are behaving badly, is quite<br/>
another!<br/>
<br/>
When a kid is never allowed to make mistakes or bad choices without<br/>
harsh consequences, when they are older, they will rebel and make bad<br/>
choices that are bigger and more dangerous.  I don&#39;t see Chamille doing<br/>
this.  Sure she dresses pretty intense, but she&#39;s sweet and kind and<br/>
doesn&#39;t have a big f*** you sign on her attitude, like a lot of teens<br/>
do.</div>

been around enough families that they see a fair range, though they  <br/>
haven&#39;t seen a lot of abusive behavior as far as I know, and I had  <br/>
when I was their age).<br/>
<br/>
I also don&#39;t want them to live in opposition or reaction to the way  <br/>
they were raised.   I have a friend whose parents were hippies. She  <br/>
treats her children in conservative ways.  She wants to live in  <br/>
conservative ways (things all from the store, matching, new--nothing  <br/>
funky or old or used).   There&#39;s not much personal history in her  <br/>
home.  I know other children of the Santa Fe hippie crowd, and many  <br/>
of them are neither conform to hippiedom nor reject it.  They just  <br/>
live their own lives in thoughtful and balanced ways.<br/>

I hardly ever press my kids to do something immediately, so when I  <br/>

question.   With my kids, it&#39;s not obedience at all.  It&#39;s trust.    <br/>
If I abused that trust by using &quot;right now&quot; in situations that didn&#39;t  <br/>
need it, pretty soon they&#39;d be ignoring me or avoiding me or rolling  <br/>
their eyes behind my back as so many other people&#39;s kids do.<br/>
<br/>
And when my kids tell me they need me to do something right now, I  <br/>

<br/>
I did switch tracks.  Mainly because I don&#39;t yet have hindsight or<br/>
experience with how unschooling works in the long run.  And I can&#39;t really<br/>
say what I don&#39;t know.  (The problem with someone inexperienced giving<br/>
uninformed opinions that can sound like advice.)<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re right I was speaking of my own experience.<br/>
<br/>
But I *do* think that if an unschooler isn&#39;t experienced and isn&#39;t making<br/>
much in the way of strides toward wholelife radical unschooling in how they<br/>
live that the above can be very much the case.<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s not an argument against unschooling so much as an argument for<br/>
unschoolers to get more skills as fast as they can develop them!<br/>

<br/>
For me, the above is so wonderfully profound.  In a relationship sense and<br/>
in a religious sense.  Trust is about relationship and a lot of religious<br/>
don&#39;t major on relationship but obedience.  So this brings new meaning to<br/>
faith, parenting and relationship to the phrase &quot;trust and obey.&quot;  Listening<br/>
because the relationship is such that you can trust one another to hear<br/>
what&#39;s being said and respond!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not there where I want to be on that.  The fact that obedience was so<br/>
prominent an extolled virtue in the home I grew up in and the fact that the<br/>
going maxim was always that children should be seen and not heard means that<br/>
I have years of crusty built up distrust towards any and everybody!  Even<br/>
Karl.  :(<br/>
<br/>
So that&#39;s a good handle on the idea for me... how to get friendly with the<br/>
&quot;trust and obey&quot; phrase in ways that matter to me now that long practice of<br/>
using it a certain unuseful way has ruined the idea.<br/>
<br/>
This could help me in thinking about my relationship with Brian too.  :)  So<br/>
it&#39;s good in all ways to focus on relationship and making trust flourish.<br/>

their decision (which can be good or bad, if the parents make the<br/>

SOMETHING about the path they take, vs. taking the same one their<br/>
parents traveled.)<br/>

the store. Either they didn&#39;t know they COULD have them, or just<br/>
didn&#39;t care enough to ask. Either way, as I would pass the item and<br/>
say, &quot;Maybe later&quot; or &quot;You just got a lot of toys for your birthday&quot;<br/>
he would only get louder and insist in a demanding voice, &quot;But I<br/>
WAAANT IIIIT!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
So after he melts down because I stop the cart and take him out<br/>
because he won&#39;t stop (I know! I KNOW! Believe, I know...) I try to<br/>
think what I SHOULD be doing instead. I know he likes all the toys he<br/>
sees. I think the same thing, to be honest. I&#39;d love a TON of stuff I<br/>
see. And so I tell him that. And I explain that I just don&#39;t have<br/>
money to buy everything in the store. Then I suggest to both of them<br/>
that maybe instead of shouting out &quot;I want that&quot; they could point to<br/>
the things they want or like and say &quot;I wish I could have that&quot; and<br/>
that way I&#39;d know what they want, and I wouldn&#39;t be required to answer<br/>
in a negative way (I wanted to answer Caleb in the positive when he<br/>
started out, but what can I say when the answer MUST be no because I<br/>
don&#39;t have the money and he did just have a birthday and I actually<br/>
WAS getting them something in that same store that he had just<br/>
requested earlier that day....)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it worked great. They pointed to everything in every isle, but<br/>
weren&#39;t demanding, and I answered back &quot;I wish you could have it too.<br/>
Maybe for Christmas or another time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It was something, anyway.<br/>

time in the store.  I&#39;m in the same isle looking things over while he pulls<br/>

We get so much from going to the store and any toy area usually gets a lot<br/>

&gt; &gt; I hardly ever press my kids to do something immediately, so when I<br/>
&gt; &gt; do, they do it without question. Many parents whose goal is to have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;obedience&quot; work hard to try to get kids who will &quot;obey&quot; without<br/>
&gt; &gt; question. With my kids, it&#39;s not obedience at all. It&#39;s trust.<br/>
&gt; &gt; If I abused that trust by using &quot;right now&quot; in situations that didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; need it, pretty soon they&#39;d be ignoring me or avoiding me or rolling<br/>
&gt; &gt; their eyes behind my back as so many other people&#39;s kids do.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; And when my kids tell me they need me to do something right now, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; jump. If Marty or Holly say &quot;Mom, come here!&quot; I do it. Maybe<br/>
&gt; &gt; they&#39;re bleeding. Maybe they want to show me something on TV that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; not being recorded. Maybe there&#39;s a beautiful bug that hasn&#39;t flown<br/>
&gt; &gt; away yet.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I trust them.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; These are things I&#39;m working on right now. I know all too often I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t listen with my body when my kids are talking to me. And all too<br/>
&gt; often I ask them to do something for ME right now...<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I carry a note book and write down the item in it. Then when those special <br/>
times when we can make purchases (which for us means a larger paycheck, or I <br/>
have sold a  lot of dolls) come up I get out the list and we revisit the <br/>
items. Of course most are no longer wanted, at least not with the same <br/>
urgency. Jayn has also made a wish book with pictures cut from catalogs <br/>
pasted down. That act in itself has often been enough to allow the desire to <br/>
wane naturally - or solidify so we have devised a saving strategy.<br/>
<br/>
About the different words....Somehow, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to <br/>
negate Jayn&#39;s desire just to make myself feel better or make it easier for <br/>
me. It seems like it takes a real and strong emotion, that could be a good <br/>
feeling, an empowering feeling, and forces the child to get all wistful <br/>
instead. It sounds a little inauthentic to direct *their* speech into <br/>
euphemism. I&#39;d be cautious about seeing that as an ongoing useful strategy.<br/>
<br/>
I have found it better to change how *I* phrase my response away from &quot;no&quot; <br/>
into &quot;wow that is a cool toy. What do you like about it?&quot; types of <br/>
conversation, as well as the &quot;I wish..&quot; words as well.. The verbal choices <br/>
aren&#39;t between &quot;Oh yes, let&#39;s buy it now&quot; and &quot;No you can&#39;t have it&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Philosophically, it&#39;s up to me to accept and be the vessel for Jayn&#39;s strong <br/>
emotions, even when they are uncomfortable or inconvenient for me. It&#39;s <br/>
embarrassing when a child is melting down in public, but those are the times <br/>
when it helps just to shut out the world and focus intently on Jayn.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-510691081">-=-I try really hard to only offer information or ideas that I genuinely<br/>
think the kids might not have considered. I have tried their whole<br/>
lives NOT to tell them things they already knew because that seemed to<br/>
me to be a great way to get them to stop paying attention to what I<br/>
said.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Holly, especially, will say &quot;Will you checklist me?&quot; when she&#39;s going  <br/>
on a trip or headed off for the culmination of some project.  And she  <br/>
means for me to offer  her information and ideas and a list of things  <br/>
she might need to have, so that she can check them off aloud, and add  <br/>
those I come up with.   But if she doesn&#39;t ask, I usually will say  <br/>
&quot;Do you have your phone charger?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Her boyfriend was leaving for a day or two away, and I asked him if  <br/>
he had his allergy medicine.  He said no, thank you, I&#39;ll get it.  So  <br/>
I figured if he hadn&#39;t thought of that there might be other things.    <br/>
I asked about a couple of things, and he went to get them, and  <br/>
thanked me, and went out to the car.  Then he came back in and got  <br/>
his allergy meds. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Marty and Holly somehow, years ago, just started to say &quot;thank you&quot;  <br/>
when I advised them about things.  Sometimes it means &quot;I know&quot; and  <br/>
sometimes it means &quot;Oh!  good thinking.&quot;  But they acknowledge for  <br/>
themselves and me that they are being assisted and encouraged.<br/>
<br/>
My friend Jeff is in his 40s now, but has been hanging around me  <br/>
since he was 20 and I was pregnant with Kirby.  We made a code  <br/>
between us years ago, that if one of us reminds the other of  <br/>
something we&#39;ve already remembered, or gives advice we&#39;d already  <br/>
thought of, we say &quot;You are very wise.&quot;  Or &quot;very wise.&quot;  And it&#39;s  <br/>
not said meanly or sarcastically, it&#39;s more like &quot;I&#39;m glad you  <br/>
would&#39;ve reminded me if I hadn&#39;t already thought of it.&quot;  And it&#39;s  <br/>
much nicer than an impatient &quot;I know that&quot; or &quot;I did that already.&quot;<br/>

that Chamille took, but she&#39;s got some other stuff mixed in...<br/>

<br/>
Well there&#39;s a picture of what she looked like that day.  The mall<br/>
security told me, because I asked, that they considered it a mask likely<br/>
to cause a disturbance, and that it was part of city code.  She&#39;s worn<br/>
that make up to other malls and nobody has ever said a thing about it. <br/>
This particular mall caters to rich old white ladies and I think that<br/>
was the problem.  She probably scared some old lady, who complained to<br/>
security.<br/>
<br/>
She doesn&#39;t wear her make up like that much anymore, she does it<br/>
different lately, but for a while she did that a lot, fake blood,<br/>
stitches and the like.  It was shocking at first but I got used to it. <br/>
It all stems from anime really.  In anime those characters will go<br/>
around with blood and bandages and it&#39;s just part of the show.  I think<br/>
Chamille wanted to see what that felt like.  She probably would have<br/>
loved to fight some vampires or some other bad guy and such, but ya<br/>
know, you do what you can, and I&#39;m pretty sure that I can&#39;t create that<br/>
for her reality.<br/>

nearly as often as she used to.  Sometimes still, but it&#39;s easier to use<br/>
words to negotiate.<br/>
<br/>
When she was younger and totally upset in the store, I would sit down in<br/>
the nearest quiet corner in the store and put her on my lap and hold her<br/>
and hug her or sit next to her until she was quiet and still.  I often<br/>
counted backwards aloud from 10-1 and breathed deeply while doing it. <br/>
It allowed her to focus on something different.  Counting from 1-10<br/>
didn&#39;t usually work because it was too ordinary, counting backwards<br/>
caught her attention because she was trying to figure out what I was<br/>
doing with those numbers.<br/>
<br/>
It always embarrassed Chamille much more than it ever embarrassed me<br/>
when her sister freaked out in the store.  Margaux is LOUD and very<br/>
clear about her feelings, even when she couldn&#39;t articulate them into<br/>
words.</div>
