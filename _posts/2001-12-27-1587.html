<div id="ygrps-yiv-112168804">Keith, Holly and I went to a Sacred Harp sing on the 23rd.  Sacred Harp is <br/>
one of several parallel singing-school traditions from the 18th  century, <br/>
still a living tradition though, although I much prefer the 18th and 19th <br/>
century stuff to anything written lately.  I noted some of the lyrics to <br/>
share with you, taking notes while I should have been singing treble (which <br/>
is the highest part, but not the melody--the tenors have the melody).<br/>
<br/>
Sacred Harp is a shape-note book, and not the seven shapes they use in one of <br/>
the other &quot;schools,&quot; and which are in the old Broadman hymnal, but a <br/>
four-shape system called &quot;fa-sol-la.&quot;     Originally, there were three <br/>
parts--the middle voices sang melody, and that&#39;s the tenor line.  Then there <br/>
was the bass line--all men.  Then there was the treble line--all women, on a <br/>
descant.<br/>
<br/>
As four-part singing became more popular, they added (crammed in) a (usually <br/>
boring) alto line.  BUT what they gained was the ability to do in-the-round <br/>
singing (the leader stands in the middle, and people take turns leading their <br/>
favorite songs), and things with four entrances.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the Baptist (and other such) hymnal stuff came from that tradition <br/>
but the tunes were modernized in the late 19th century, early 20th.<br/>
<br/>
The music is in modes unfamiliar to us, and sometimes very fast and powerful, <br/>
and sometimes very slow and mournful and the chords just hanging in the air <br/>
around you running shivers through you.  And the most interesting part of <br/>
all:  This never stuck as church music.  Some at first, but mostly it was <br/>
sung at &quot;singings&quot;--not church services with prayers and sermons, but <br/>
gatherings for the purpose of singing.  They would start and end with a <br/>
prayer (the formal sessions still do) and if it&#39;s an annual sing, there&#39;s a <br/>
memorial about 3/4 the way through which is set aside to name those who&#39;ve <br/>
died or need prayer and then they go back to the singing.<br/>
<br/>
From Wondrous Love, second verse:  <br/>
When I was sinking down, sinking down, sinking down<br/>
When I was sinking down, sinking down.<br/>
When I was sinking down, beneath God&#39;s righteous frown<br/>
Christ laid aside His crown for my soul, for my soul,<br/>
Christ laid aside His crown for my soul.  <br/>
-----------<br/>
<br/>
A tune called Cuba (tune-name unrelated to the text):<br/>
<br/>
Go, preachers, and tell it to the world (x3)<br/>
Poor mourners found a home at last.<br/>
<br/>
Through free grace and a dying Lamb (x3)<br/>
Poor mourners found a home at last.<br/>
--------<br/>
<br/>
This one, called Africa, is an 18th century masterpiece, by Isaac Watts and <br/>
William Billings, whose names are throughout lots of hymn books and their <br/>
history.  It&#39;s slow with chord changes.  REALLY beautiful in the air.<br/>
<br/>
Now shall my inward joys arise, and burst into a song;<br/>
Almighty love inspires my heart, and pleasure tunes my tongue.<br/>
<br/>
God, on his thirsty Zion&#39;s hill, som mercy drops has thrown;<br/>
And solemn oaths have bound His love to show&#39;r salvation down.<br/>
<br/>
Why do we then indulge our fears, suspicions and complaints?<br/>
Is He a God, and shall His grace grow weary of His Saints?<br/>
<br/>
[What I don&#39;t know is the &quot;solemn oaths&quot; part--who would God swear to?  Or <br/>
who swore to God to earn this &quot;mercy&quot;?  The verse cited at the top of the <br/>
page is &quot;The Lord hath comforted his people and will have mercy upon his <br/>
afflicted.&quot;  --Isaiah 49:13]<br/>
<br/>
----------------<br/>
<br/>
From &quot;Redemption,&quot; second verse and refrain:<br/>
<br/>
Oh! He suffered there for guilty man, His life so freely gave<br/>
When He paid the debt we could not pay and triumphed o&#39;er the grave.<br/>
<br/>
Oh his blood was shed that we might live with Him when life is o&#39;er<br/>
And upon the clouds of glory ride safe to that peaceful shore.<br/>
<br/>
