&gt; So, when did your kids start regularly ordering meals for themselves,<br/>
&gt; responding to waitpeople, cashiers, or people at social gatherings who<br/>
&gt; polietely say something to them?  I&#39;m just curious.  And has anyone else<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I remember taking Lars for speech therapy when he was 3.  (We were in the<br/>
constant question phase, and I couldn&#39;t understand the questions - very<br/>
frustrating for us both.)  The therapist wanted me to send him in alone.  I<br/>
told her that he could go alone if he wanted (I knew he wouldn&#39;t) but that<br/>
she could count on him not saying a word to them if he did.  He was very<br/>
uncomfortable speaking with strangers (even people I knew) for years<br/>
*except* in a sports situation.  The first time I took him to a sports group<br/>
(age 5), he boogied right off to play.  I was surprised and mentioned it to<br/>
dh, who said he was exactly the same as a kid, shy except for sports.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
He gradually became more comfortable, but he still wouldn&#39;t call anyone on<br/>
the phone.  Even when friends called him, he&#39;d get on his bike and go over<br/>
to their house rather than return the call.  Now he&#39;ll call friends, but not<br/>
businesses.<br/>
<br/>
My granddaughter will talk to anyone, and has for a long time.  She gets on<br/>
the phone to call and invite people she barely knows to performances she&#39;s<br/>
going to be in, that kind of thing.  The other day, she insisted on going<br/>
into the bank *by herself* to do her banking.  She&#39;s 8.  Lars is 15 and<br/>
still wants me to come in with him, though I no longer have to go right up<br/>
to the teller with him.  I think he&#39;s more concerned about filling out the<br/>
slips correctly.  Kids vary so much.<br/>
