<div id="ygrps-yiv-1802795977">I just found this dated   July 1998 on what I&#39;m salvaging from two computers <br/>
before this.   I remember writing it, but I don&#39;t think it was published.   I <br/>
think it was on a discussion list or maybe at unschooling.com back in the day. <br/>
   Someone, maybe Joyce Fetteroll, came up with the name of the story I half <br/>
remembered right away, and I went and read it again.    <br/>
<br/>
I thought it had some good parts, but if it wasn&#39;t published, it shouldn&#39;t go <br/>
into the collection of published essays I&#39;m compiling.    Anyone remember it? <br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,   Sandra<br/>

=====================================<br/>
INNIES AND OUTIES<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;To push kids in all kinds of directions in order for them to be fluent at <br/>
cocktail parties is a waste of time, imho. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Depends whether the goal is for them to be fascinating and interesting to the <br/>
brightest people there, or just not to embarrass themselves in front of the <br/>
other safe, quiet, dull folks.    Some people really, truly WANT to only <br/>
discuss the weather, current local (yet safe) politics, current events (just the <br/>
innocuous stuff) and the decor in the house.   That way they can make some soft <br/>
noise for a couple of hours and not really SAY anything.   That&#39;s<br/>
cocktail party stuff for you.   There seem to be whole friendships, <br/>
organizations, marriages, based on this very surface, calm, don&#39;t-rock-the-boat <br/>
behavior.    <br/>
<br/>
Public school discourages kids from coming up with off-the-wall responses.   <br/>
No bank shots, please.   Just go directly from the question to the first <br/>
sufficient answer; nothing tricky or dramatic.   Nothing that makes you think, or <br/>
makes the teacher think.   If your answer isn&#39;t what&#39;s in the teacher&#39;s manual <br/>
your answer is wrong.   If you did extra thinking you wasted your time.<br/>
<br/>
If you want your kids to be REALLY interesting at cocktail parties, leave <br/>
their passions alone.    I would pay money to be at parties with REALLY <br/>
interesting people because I don&#39;t give a rat&#39;s patoot what the scores of yesterday&#39;s <br/>
sports games were, or whether a new government contract is coming to town, or <br/>
how the weather was in southern California if I wasn&#39;t even there.    But if <br/>
those people want to talk about their own new job or a sport they were involved <br/>
in or their response to seeing a tornado or a hurricane for the first time, <br/>
THAT I would like to hear.    If they saw the The Lion King stage show and have <br/>
read everything there is to find about the designer, THAT I want to hear.   If <br/>
they got to touch the brigandine plate armor that was found near Four Corners <br/>
YES!! TELL ME!!!   That stuff didn&#39;t come from school, or Newsweek, or the <br/>
local paper.<br/>
<br/>
Life.   People can live lives, even little kids live lives, without <br/>
preparation, learning on the job, as they go.   They can learn while doing real things <br/>
with real happiness and real success.    <br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s the Kurt Vonnegut story about the handicaps?   Where people are <br/>
&quot;created equal&quot; by government handicaps?   Smart people hear a frightening/alarming <br/>
sound every minute or two from the headphones they&#39;re allowed to wear.   <br/>
Strong people have to wear weights.   Good looking people have to wear masks.    <br/>
School tries to do that.   Even in the gifted programs, kids are often stuck in <br/>
a chair and asked to complete checklists of tasks, not to go off on their own <br/>
at maximum speed and change directions when they feel the urge to.   <br/>
Homeschoolers can do that, unless they&#39;re careful not to.   We&#39;re taught to sublimate <br/>
urges, to prove we&#39;re mature by ignoring our urges and doing what we&#39;re told.   <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Creativity doesn&#39;t come from reading the chapter and answering the questions.<br/>
