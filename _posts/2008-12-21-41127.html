<div id="ygrps-yiv-28989857">I was wondering what others are doing to save for their children&#39;s future and why.<br/>
<br/>
We currently have a UTMA for each child.  We had been contributing monthly, but when we realized that college was may not be the goal for our boys we stopped.  Sometimes I think that was the right idea, sometimes I don&#39;t.  Anyway, the boys each get a large check from my parents at Christmas that has previously been added to their accounts, but my parents do not ask for it to be.  <br/>
<br/>
My dilemma is whether to continue funding these accounts at all.  The boys are really wanting to buy more on a daily basis and this money could mean a lot more of that.  Money put away means more options later and money to spend now means more options now.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what children that do not go to college would do with a large amount of money at 21.  <br/>
<br/>
Side note:  An UTMA in our state is money that can be spent by the parent at any time to fund anything other than basic expenses.  It can be used for camps, computers, college, car and the remainder is given to the child when they turn 21.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for you thoughts.  This has been a big discussion between dh and I for at least a year.  Some new perspective would be great.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2035277137">If the money can be handed over when the child is 21, why not keep <br/>
funding it? That way, they&#39;ll have a nice &quot;nest egg&quot; that they can <br/>
use for expenses or to reinvest into RRSP&#39;s or other things.<br/>
<br/>
We have RESP&#39;s in Canada (Registered Educational Savings Plans) that <br/>
while they HAVE to be used towards post secondary education, a <br/>
technical school also counts and if not used, the funds can be rolled <br/>

<br/>
Kirby (22) saves money.  He bought himself a nice suit last year for  <br/>
the company Christmas party, and wore it again this year.  He bought  <br/>
a new computer a year ago, too.<br/>
<br/>
Marty (nearly 20) is buying a jeep.  If he got a sum of money, he  <br/>
would pay off that car loan.<br/>
<br/>
Holly (17) would put money into savings.  She got Christmas money  <br/>
from her grandparents ($100) and bought a $45 bonsai tree and put the  <br/>
rest into the bank.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.blogspot.com/2008/12/holly-bought-little-tree.html">http://sandradodd.blogspot.com/2008/12/holly-bought-little-tree.html</a><br/>
<br/>
We got savings bonds when they were little that can be used tax free  <br/>
if they&#39;re used for higher education.  Marty is thinking vaguely  <br/>
about going to college, but I think it has to happen before they&#39;re  <br/>
24 or some age (maybe younger than that).   I&#39;ve thought sometimes of  <br/>
finishing grad school (having dropped out two or three times) and we  <br/>
could use it for that.  But I&#39;m old.  Maybe I&#39;d rather cash them out  <br/>
and pay taxes on them at some point in here.<br/>
<br/>
No advance decisions like that are perfect.  You might have to toss a  <br/>
coin and then see how you feel about the side that came up.   I think  <br/>
coin tosses are good ways to make decisions.  I don&#39;t go by what the  <br/>
coin says, but if I find myself sharply disappointed or relieved, I  <br/>
have a better idea which I really want to do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-637565377">It sounds as though there is a lot of flexibility about what to do<br/>
with the money, which is nice.  They could use it for college, a car,<br/>
a downpayment on a house, travelling around the world... .all sorts of<br/>
really fun things.<br/>
<br/>
It sounded like your chief concern was whether or not it would be<br/>
better to spend it on things they want and love now or save it up for<br/>
something really great later.  It&#39;s also good to keep in mind that<br/>
they can probably go to a state college without that money, but loans<br/>
would be probably be required.<br/>
<br/>
Are your kids old enough to talk about it with you?  Maybe you could<br/>
calculate how much they would probably have if you put<br/>
100/90/80....10% of the grandparent money in the account every year<br/>
and what they could do with that later.  Actually, for their ages<br/>
maybe that is too many numbers... mayble all, half, and a quarter.<br/>
Maybe they will want it all now.  Maybe not.  Maybe some of each will<br/>
sound good to them.  maybe you could suggest the answer that seems<br/>
best to you and ask them if that is OK with them to do this year.  You<br/>
can always do things differently next year.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing to consider is that the money that you put in now will<br/>
have much longer to grow (along with the fact that stock prices are<br/>
really low) which makes this years money seem more valuable to invest<br/>
than the check they get when they are 16 which probably won&#39;t grow<br/>
much at all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1920187608">We are saving for both kids, currently in a Coverdell (Educational IRA).  If they decide against post-secondary education and we end up taking a tax hit, so be it.   They&#39;ll be doing something as adults, and pretty much everything costs money.  I can imagine it funding travel, a downpayment on a home, money to start a business, a car, investment into whatever their passion is, or a host of other things.  And the idea that I can help my children get a positive start to their adult life makes me happy.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;ll change my mind when they reach adulthood if it turns out I don&#39;t like the person one or both of them has become.  But its hard to imagine, because I do like them an awful lot right now.  They are such good-hearted people. (and I&#39;ll always love them regardless)<br/>
<br/>
Either way, it won&#39;t be enough to pay for 4 yrs of college, unless the stock market rallies in a huge way between now and then.  They are still preschool aged, so ya never know. ;)  <br/>
<br/>
But we do balance how much we can save with how much we want to spend now and how much we want to give to others.  If you ask my parents or more conservative brothers, we aren&#39;t saving nearly enough.  But the thing is, how we live our lives now, the experiences we can have with our children, the toys, the fun -- it will all shape them as they grow.  And is already -  they joy is apparent.<br/>

We used to say we were saving for Kirby&#39;s college and Marty&#39;s legal  <br/>
fees and hospitalization.<br/>
<br/>
Marty&#39;s never really been hurt, nor in trouble, and Kirby has a good  <br/>
job that didn&#39;t need college.<br/>
<br/>
I never thought a little pile of money would be a problem but tax  <br/>
laws are confusing and we&#39;re still waiting to see whether Holly needs  <br/>
it.   We could still have therapy needs in the future, for sure.<br/>

*** This is some good advice I was expecting (and maybe hoping) more spend it now responses.  It is interesting to hear so much on the saving side.  <br/>
<br/>
We do have enough money to take care of all our basic expenses.  It would be nice to be able to say yes more to things like ice skating, bowling, new toys and small trips.  Which we do provide when John works overtime, or we juggle other things.  However, I would also like to be able to provide big things later.  Classes, computers, cars...  <br/>
<br/>
I think a crystal ball would be helpful right around now....<br/>

***Thinking about it this way helps.  Our current goal is to pay off the house when the boys are in their early teens.  We can then travel, move into a bigger house, save money, or let dh work less.  Thinking of saving for the kids as part of that plan makes it feel like it is helping us move toward family goals and not just sacrificing the present for the future.<br/>
I was always raised to save, and I&#39;m having trouble figuring out my current thoughts from how I was raised.  And probably wrapped up in all of this is a good friend lost her 5 yo to a playground accident this summer.  It is very hard to think of the future at the moment.<br/>
