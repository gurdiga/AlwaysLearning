<div id="ygrps-yiv-1929094307">My ds(15) is an awesome, awesome person. He&#39;s funny, bright, quick, responsible and musically talented. I love being around him, and I feel pretty sure he still considers me his friend. But he&#39;s got one trait that is really starting to get on my nerves, and I need advice how to handle it in a way that won&#39;t ruin our relationship: He seems determined to waste energy at every opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
Now, hear me out before you judge. The *only* reason this is an issue is because money is very tight around here. We&#39;re really trying to cut our costs, since dh and I are already working a lot. We agree that it&#39;s best to cut expenses rather than lose yet *more* family time to work yet *more* hours.<br/>
<br/>
Ds, though, seems as though he&#39;s being passive-aggressive in his energy use. It&#39;s beyond simply being forgetful about turning lights off or whatever; the only things he &quot;remembers&quot; to turn off are the things that matter to him (the computer and the XBox). That would be fine if his leaving things on wouldn&#39;t affect the rest of us so much. But it does, and I really need help in finding a solution.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been observing for months now and trying to explain and talk it out with him. Any time in the past that we&#39;ve had clashing interests, we&#39;ve been able to talk it out. Not so, this time. He&#39;s extraordinarily responsible, self-reliant, and independent in almost every other way. It&#39;s like he&#39;s rebelling against the only thing he has to rebel against. And that tells me that I&#39;m handling this wrong. But I don&#39;t know how I *should* be handling it. <br/>
 <br/>
Help!<br/>

Talking doesn&#39;t save electricity,though.  You turn the things off.  If  <br/>
you want to make a point with him, keep track of how many times you&#39;ve  <br/>
turned it off and then remind him once a week, maybe, but not every  <br/>

There are some notes from a prior conversation.<br/>
<br/>
Does he feel, or has he been told, that other electricity and lights  <br/>
and appliances around the house belong to you and not to him?  Ae the  <br/>
computer and XBox the only things he does feel are his own?<br/>
<br/>
Do you pay for XBox live for him?  Does he get an allowance?  Does he  <br/>
have spending money?<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid I got the crummiest allowance ever; not enough to buy  <br/>
a 50Â¢ paperback book.   My mom would grouse and complain about things  <br/>
like the lights being on, and woudn&#39;t give me a dime, but she was  <br/>
buying coffee, cigarettes and beer for herself without fail.  Then to  <br/>
add insult, she would tell me to bring her a cigarette, or to make her  <br/>
some coffee, or to do the dishes (including the percolator).  Those  <br/>
things were hers, not mine.  But I was expected to take care of them  <br/>
AND be frugal so she could more easily afford more.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>He understands that mom and dad are responsible for paying the electric bill, so we&#39;re concerned about the amount. But very little has been made into &quot;ours&quot; versus &quot;his.&quot; The only things I can think of, in fact, with specific ownership around here are my husband&#39;s power tools, for safety reasons... but ds has no interest in them.<br/>
<br/>
He does get an allowance (since he&#39;s been cutting the lawn, $25 per cutting) and he pays his on XBox Live subscription. He&#39;s responsible about the XBox and the computer (and his musical instruments, now that I think of it) because they are the focus of his home life. <br/>
<br/>
BTW, I mostly just turn things off as I&#39;m going about my day, saying something to my ds maybe 2 or 3 times a week. I did take him and his brother out to the meter once to show them what it looked like when our normal stuff was all up and running, then again when everything was turned off. Little bro understood and has been really good about turning things off. Big bro understood, but doesn&#39;t seem to care.<br/>
<br/>
I finally posted here after finding his A/C running, the TV on, the toilet running, and all the lights on yesterday morning when I woke up. I&#39;m very frustrated. Someone suggested I flip the fuse to his room. While I&#39;ve no doubt he&#39;ll start turning things off after that, I&#39;m even more convinced our relationship would be ruined. And I&#39;m NOT okay with that.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, he&#39;s 15. He&#39;s likely to move out of this hick town as soon as he can, so that&#39;s only a few more years of these high bills, right? And although I&#39;m concerned for his financial well-being when he moves out, that&#39;s a lesson he&#39;ll surely get when the bill is his own. {sigh}<br/>

The toilet doesn&#39;t take electricity, does it? Unless you have your own  <br/>
well and pump.<br/>
<br/>
When I come in to lots of lights on, and I ask, there&#39;s often a fairly  <br/>
logical explanation.  There are families that would love to restore or  <br/>
improve relationships with their kids, and pay counsellors $60 to $200  <br/>
an hour to get help.   Maybe just having been less uptight about  <br/>
things earlier could&#39;ve eliminated the need for family counselling.<br/>
<br/>
I think being very angsty about it is worse for your health and the  <br/>
happiness of the family than just turning off lights would be.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>But we are on a very, very tight budget here. We all agreed that cable &quot;cannot&quot; be cut back -- TV and the internet our whole lives, lol! I&#39;ve been trying to find places we *can* cut back, and his continued waste of electricity in the face of our tight budget is not about angst. It&#39;s simply that we don&#39;t have money to waste on unused electricity (or anything else being wasted, for that matter). <br/>
<br/>
It may come to him not getting paid for cutting the lawn because the money had to go to the electric bill. That&#39;s simply our reality here. But I am trying very hard to avoid that because of the resentment that would surely ensue.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I just want him to care enough to make an effort. But you can&#39;t *make* someone care about something. So what do you do when their lack of concern affects you?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How knowledgeable are you about how much electricity is really used by <br/>
different appliances? Because - too many parents nag their children over <br/>
things that are really quite negligible, while they don&#39;t make other <br/>
changes that would make much larger differences.<br/>
<br/>
Electricity rates vary a lot - average in California, where I live, is <br/>
about 16 cents per kwh, but in Washington State the average is under 8 <br/>
cents per kwh.<br/>
<br/>
Okay - so look at the reality. A 1,000 watt window air condition (a <br/>
medium size) uses 1 kwh in an hour. So it costs from 8 to 15 cents to <br/>
run it for an hour or 80 cents to $1.50 to run it for ten hours.<br/>
<br/>
A 100 watt lightbulb costs 1/10th of that - or .8 to 1.5 cents for an <br/>
hour. TEN hours of leaving a 100 watt lightbulb on would cost 8 to 15 cents.<br/>
<br/>
If you use compact fluorescent replacements they will cost about 1/4 of <br/>
that --- so about .2 to .4 cents for an hour or 2 to 4 cents for 10 hours.<br/>
<br/>
So - switch to CF lighting - and figure even if he left lights on for <br/>
the entire month, it would cost a total of about a dollar and a half up <br/>
to maybe three dollars for the whole month, 24 hours per day.<br/>
<br/>
Is it worth stressing and messing up your relationship over a light bulb?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you guys could go to this website - put in your appliances and <br/>
figure out where you really could save enough money to make it <br/>
worthwhile to worry about it?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://michaelbluejay.com/electricity/howmuch.html">http://michaelbluejay.com/electricity/howmuch.html</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know my husband sometimes gets on us about leaving lights on and I <br/>
sometimes remind him that if he just turns them off when he notices it, <br/>
that he might save a penny or two and he can also save a negative moment <br/>
if he just does it without letting it annoy him (or us).<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, my husband earns most of the money that lets us live <br/>
this amazing lifestyle and so I try to honor that by using the money <br/>
carefully. So I&#39;m not saying to encourage waste, I&#39;m saying that you <br/>
should know how much money you&#39;re really talking about and decide <br/>
whether it is really worth having hard feelings over it.<br/>

cutting) &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Being a bit picky myself here - it&#39;s not an &quot;allowance&quot; if he is earning it. <br/>
It&#39;s wages.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I finally posted here after finding his A/C running, the TV on, the <br/>
toilet running, and all the lights on yesterday morning when I woke up. I&#39;m <br/>

our relationship would be ruined. And I&#39;m NOT okay with that.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We have similar issues here - Jayn wanted to take one of her long playing <br/>
type of showers and run the big heating light in the bathroom. It especially <br/>
bothers her father to see her being so oblivious to ecological issues and <br/>
our utility bills. However she heard his suggestions to get out as nagging, <br/>
(and tbh he did sound pretty cranky). She can&#39;t bear to feel &quot;in the wrong&quot; <br/>
and instantly became defensive. He wanted me to step in and fix his problem. <br/>
The real disagreement here was between James and I - over how long is too <br/>
long in the shower, and is it worth the fight. I tend to lean on the side of <br/>
&quot;not&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn is very aware of other eco-issues, like picking up litter, recycling <br/>
and using cloth shopping bags. I think her awareness and what might be <br/>
called &quot;empathy for the earth&quot; comes in waves. Finding information on line, <br/>
or watching science programs seems to allow Jay to absorb the information <br/>
(and then want talk about it) much more readily than when it comes initially <br/>
from me or James. In our subsequent discussion about it (ie James and my <br/>
discussion) he asked me to find a way to show Jayn why her excessive water <br/>
use is a problem, help her become aware of the drought in CA, and we talked <br/>
about tv and the internet being the best source for this, rather than him <br/>
telling her to get out of the shower. I asked him to practice some more <br/>
patience. So we are back on the same page again.<br/>
<br/>
One of my answers is to take up as much of the slack as I can manage. I make <br/>
sure I am turning off as much as I can. I take short showers (which is also <br/>
modelling). Of course every light bulb in our house is a compact <br/>
fluorescent, as I am sure is the case in Adesa&#39;s home. I can&#39;t &quot;make her&quot; <br/>
take responsibility. I can only allow her to when she is ready.<br/>
<br/>
We had a blackout late last night for about three hours - a blown <br/>
transformer apparently. It was interesting to talk about &quot;the olden days&quot; of <br/>
working by candlelight. The only problem with an all electric kitchen is our <br/>
inability to cook. The blackout happened just as Jayn had said that she was <br/>
hungry! I made tuna salad on crackers, the first time she had eaten that, <br/>
and it was fun. Even a few hours made us appreciate how much electricity we <br/>
use and how much we depend upon power. It was all rather magical timing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We had a very similar experience - a very severe ice storm in early December left many people in our area (upstate NY) without power - trees were cracking for hours from the weight of ice on branches, power companies having to clear limbs off streets, houses, and lines...<br/>
<br/>
We were two and a half days without electricity, and it was cold.  We&#39;re lucky.  We have a woodstove...we cooked on it (grilled salmon and garlic toast, and jiffy-pop popcorn, which was really fun!), heated warmed coffee and hot chocolate boiled on our gas stove, used our enclosed porch as a fridge, burned soy candles for light, piled on blankets with hot basalt rocks between, and camped out together in the family room...and, since we also have a well and pump, broke out the bottled water.<br/>
<br/>
During the days, we read, and talked, and played.  We all loved the magic of that enforced closeness and the sense of weathering something we&#39;d remember fondly for a long time.  both kids love to take sponge baths in a kettle of snowmelt, so we collected some, let it sit on the woodstove, then used it for cleaning bodies and dishes.  After, we snuggled in together.<br/>
<br/>
Which doesn&#39;t mean we didn&#39;t cheer when the power returned - or groan when it went out again for a few hours!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe there is something useful here.  Would it be feasible to suggest a power vacation for your entire family?  I&#39;m thinking it wouldn&#39;t need to be long - just long enough to turn toward each other and notice the things we don&#39;t tend to notice so clearly when there are ample electronic diversions available to us.<br/>
<br/>
This might help your son to understand what a life without his prized electronics would be like.  Maybe it would help, if you haven&#39;t done so, to show your kids the power bill and discuss frankly how much budget is available for that. To ask them if they have any ideas how the family *as a whole* might bring usage into balance with that budget.  To explain what will happen if the bill can&#39;t be paid.  Not in a threatening way, but an informative one.  Doing this with the power out, and in a way that doesn&#39;t target the child you&#39;re seeing as the prime offender, might yield surprises.<br/>
<br/>
It also might help *you* to shift your thinking.  Your posts have a hint of futility and defensiveness in them that I&#39;ve felt at times, too.  What I&#39;ve learned is that what seems insurmountable and impossible to bear becomes almost laughable if I only shift my attitude.  The attitude shift will lead to a new or different action if you let it.  Maybe it&#39;ll be one of the suggestions posted here, or something that pops into your head in an unexpected moment.  But if you&#39;re open for it, focused on changing *your* thinking rather than *his* habit, you might find that this mountain quickly and effortlessly becomes a molehill.<br/>
<br/>
When I feel this hopelessness, I can always count on the very experienced voices on this list, and in the chats, to jolt me out of my unexamined thinking.  I may not always like being called on m assumptions here, at first (I&#39;m inordinately attached to my schooly beliefs, at times), but I always end up turning things over and over in my mind, worrying at them until they evolve into ideas I can use here, right now, in *my* way of being my own family.  And we are immeasurably more peaceful and joyful now than we were a year ago!<br/>
<br/>
I hope you find some of the same! =)<br/>

-------------------------------<br/>
As part of a girl scout project Anika(9) and Eric (dh)  Did the math  <br/>
on several appliances including the TV and computer screens we use  <br/>
most.  Because our electricity is on a graduating scale in California  <br/>
based on usage, the TV takes between 15 cents to 30 cents per hour to  <br/>
run at our house.  She observed that it didn&#39;t seem like much but that  <br/>
it amounted to a dollar to 2 dollars a night when people fall asleep  <br/>
in front of it and forget to turn it off until morning.  When two  <br/>
people do this (which used to be common) it could add up to a very  <br/>
significant amount. (maybe $15 per week)  Also, making sure they don&#39;t  <br/>
run when no one is watching them can keep us in a lower price bracket  <br/>
which helps even more.  Once everyone understood this they were more  <br/>
than willing to try harder to remember to turn them off when not in  <br/>
use and set their timers at night so they do not run.  I am used to  <br/>
getting up once in the night and turning things off (if I wake up)   <br/>
but lately the kids have been policing it for themselves.  They want  <br/>
to save the money for use elsewhere and are concerned about  <br/>
conservation.  No conflict, just mutual support.<br/>
<br/>
We also turn off lights when leaving a room but by far the more  <br/>
significant step was changing them to compact fluorescents.  Our bill  <br/>
went down by a third the month we made the switch.   Nagging kids to  <br/>
change their habits would not have made nearly so significant a  <br/>
difference and definitely would have eroded our relationships.<br/>

I could totally imagine that my own parents could have written this sentence<br/>

.  I didn&#39;t then and still don&#39;t know why I couldn&#39;t think like they did<br/>
about &#39;saving&#39; electricity.   I think much of it though was probably simply<br/>
because I was a kid and didn&#39;t have enough experiences yet.  There have now<br/>
been times that my children have left lots of things on, lights and<br/>
computers that no one was using and I started to get agrivated.  Then I<br/>
remembered and thought back to myself doing the same thing and my father<br/>
*seeming to* allows be there ready to say something.  I was able to let it<br/>
go remembering this and then the issue seemed to disappear.   I rarely come<br/>
down in the morning to things left on that don&#39;t need to be now.  I can&#39;t<br/>
say just why but it does seem sometimes the more I push against something<br/>
mentally the less likely things seem to sort themselves out easily.   If<br/>
after reading some of the other great advice here and this was still<br/>
something that bothered me I&#39;d think about asking my child if they&#39;d be<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-479033861">-=-Maybe there is something useful here. Would it be feasible to  <br/>
suggest a power vacation for your entire family? I&#39;m thinking it  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t need to be long - just long enough to turn toward each other  <br/>
and notice the things we don&#39;t tend to notice so clearly when there  <br/>
are ample electronic diversions available to us.<br/>
<br/>
-=-This might help your son to understand what a life without his  <br/>
prized electronics would be like.-=-<br/>
<br/>
The difference between a natural disaster and a trumped-up disaster is  <br/>
motive, though.  If the parents flip the switch with the least though  <br/>
of &quot;This&#39;ll teach you,&quot; then it&#39;s punishment and not accident.<br/>
<br/>
If someone turned the electricity off at my house just to show me what  <br/>
it would be like without electricity, I wouldn&#39;t want that person in  <br/>
my life anymore, because it&#39;s mean and controlling.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up in a town where the phone service went out sometimes and the  <br/>
electricity went out LOTS.  We had a gas stove, so food was fine.  We  <br/>
had an electric pump on our well; water was hard.<br/>
<br/>
Because of SCA camping and feasts, we always have lots of candles and  <br/>
we have coleman stoves and a coleman heater (a propane heater).  Once  <br/>
the electricity went off in our old neighborhood, and the boys and I  <br/>
(maybe Holly wasn&#39;t born or maybe I carried her in a Snugli; I don&#39;t  <br/>
remember) went to all the elderly neighbors and gave them Cylume  <br/>
lights--chemical light sticks.  We had to show them how to use them.   <br/>
We passed out candles too, to anyone who didn&#39;t already have any, for  <br/>
eight or ten houses around.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Maybe it would help, if you haven&#39;t done so, to show your kids the  <br/>
power bill and discuss frankly how much budget is available for that.  <br/>
To ask them if they have any ideas how the family *as a whole* might  <br/>
bring usage into balance with that budget. To explain what will happen  <br/>
if the bill can&#39;t be paid. Not in a threatening way, but an  <br/>
informative one. Doing this with the power out, and in a way that  <br/>
doesn&#39;t target the child you&#39;re seeing as the prime offender, might  <br/>
yield surprises.-=-<br/>
<br/>
The child has already been tagged the prime offender, though.  And  <br/>
when my mom showed me bills and &quot;informed&quot; me what would happen to me  <br/>
(no more piano lessons or some such) if I didn&#39;t save money, it pissed  <br/>
me off.  I wanted a record player.  She couldn&#39;t afford it.  I did the  <br/>
math on a year&#39;s worth of cigarettes and showed her where she could  <br/>
get that money.  Somehow she wasn&#39;t sympathetic to me. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-Maybe it&#39;ll be one of the suggestions posted here, or something  <br/>
that pops into your head in an unexpected moment. But if you&#39;re open  <br/>
for it, focused on changing *your* thinking rather than *his* habit,  <br/>
you might find that this mountain quickly and effortlessly becomes a  <br/>
molehill.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
Very true!<br/>

Somewhere in there is some stuff about people who &quot;HAVE TO&quot; do the  <br/>
dishes, with a serious and humorous list of alternatives. That might  <br/>
help.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-882895872">-=- If<br/>
after reading some of the other great advice here and this was still<br/>
something that bothered me I&#39;d think about asking my child if they&#39;d be<br/>
willing to brainstorm ways of dealing with *my* need to have electrical<br/>
things turned off when not being used. -=-<br/>

I wanted to add that this is a good example for seeing where the need  <br/>
lies.  The lights don&#39;t need to be turned off.  It&#39;s not their &quot;need.&quot;<br/>
The child doesn&#39;t &quot;need&quot; to turn the lights off, unless it&#39;s to keep  <br/>
the parents from haranguing him, and then it&#39;s not about lights or  <br/>

<br/>
It parents don&#39;t necessarily &quot;need&quot; to have the lights turned off.   <br/>
They might want to have the lights turned off.  They might prefer it.   <br/>
But it&#39;s about the parents&#39; discomfort and shouldn&#39;t be made the kid&#39;s  <br/>
discomfort.   If he likes you enough to care about what you want,  <br/>
he&#39;ll probably be more likely to turn the lights off.<br/>

whatever is occupying his mind and his environment just doesn&#39;t  <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve watched my teen daughter change clothes and drop them where she  <br/>
is. It looks like she doesn&#39;t care or is deliberately trying to make  <br/>
more work for me. But it isn&#39;t that and if I treated it like that  <br/>
she&#39;d be hurt, insulted and eventually angry that I thought so little  <br/>
of her. If I point out what she&#39;s doing she&#39;ll come to awareness, but  <br/>
in the moment she just can&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
It will help to turn your thinking around. He&#39;s showing by his  <br/>
actions that this part of helping out he just can&#39;t do at the moment.  <br/>
Focus more on what he can do. Focus more on the saving electricity  <br/>
being your deal and the kids just help as they can.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe this will help. We have a bathroom off a bright hallway. While  <br/>
I do care about not wasting electricity, it&#39;s really hard for me to  <br/>
remember to turn off the light because there&#39;s no visual cue as I&#39;m  <br/>
leaving that the light is still on. (The switch is out in the hall.)  <br/>
My husband and daughter could nag me about it. They could make me get  <br/>
up and go turn it off to &quot;teach me.&quot; But that&#39;s all assuming I&#39;m  <br/>
willfully doing something wrong and need correction. It would be  <br/>
insulting and damaging to the relationship. What&#39;s best for all:  <br/>
electricity, relationships, peace in the atmosphere is for whoever  <br/>
notices to just turn it off.<br/>

And while I agree that it&#39;s *my* issue now, it will become his if we can&#39;t pay the electric bill. That&#39;s not a threat or an attempt to manipulate him or anyone else; it&#39;s just what happens if you don&#39;t have enough money to pay for everything. <br/>
<br/>
(Oh, and we have had the power turned off before -- not intentionally, mind you -- and we turned it into a little indoor camping experience. Fun for a few minutes, but my kids do NOT want to lose TV or computer like that ever again. They know the importance of paying your bills! And that&#39;s exactly why ds&#39;s waste has me so confused.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to not let the waste bother me and view it as simply part of him being here (like the food bill and medical care -- part and parcel of living). It&#39;s just very hard to ignore the *waste* part of it when the mail arrives and the number is that high, KWIM?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1346289752">I was just heading down to the bathroom, flipping lights off in  <br/>
bedrooms along the way, and thinking about the OPs problem. She&#39;s got  <br/>

energy is conserved, but for whatever reason, her son is not able  <br/>
right now to participate in conserving energy the way she thinks would  <br/>
be most helpful.<br/>
<br/>
I found myself wondering if some technical solutions would help. Could  <br/>
timers be put on switches? We used to have a timer on the switch for  <br/>
our bathroom fan, so you could leave it running after your shower,  <br/>
long enough to get the moisture out of the air, but not have to worry  <br/>
about it running all day if you didn&#39;t get back in there to turn it off.<br/>
<br/>
I used to teach in a building that had motion-detector light switches.  <br/>
It would turn the lights off in a room automatically if there&#39;d been  <br/>
no motion in X minutes. They weren&#39;t perfect--if I was in my classroom  <br/>
alone, grading papers, the lights would go out on me and I&#39;d have to  <br/>
stand up and wave my arms to get them to go on again--but they  <br/>
certainly did ensure that lights weren&#39;t burning for hours in empty  <br/>
rooms.<br/>

These kinds of solutions take people&#39;s faulty memories out of the  <br/>
equation to some extent.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-676184205">i may have missed a response, but i don&#39;t think so...pam s. posted about the calculating the *real* cost of the electricity and determining if that really is the issue.  i wa surprised to hear the low estimates in that post, myself, and encouraged to think about waste in a slightly different way, although we don&#39;t struggle so much with that issue in our home (but that doesn&#39;t mean my kids don&#39;t leave lights on - they do - all the time, i just prefer to turn them off and not give it any more energy.)<br/>
<br/>
the thing that is striking me about most of these posts about conserving electricity, is that, while the OP certainly coined the issue in those terms, the &quot;tone&quot;of all the subsequent posts from the OP has made it sound like the issue is more about resentment - and possibly fear?  fear that her son will never develop the willingness or the compassion (since his lack of turning off lights is being viewed as unwillingness, as opposed to inability to remember/focus on that issue) to do something that is important to someone else?<br/>
<br/>
i just wanted to throw that out there, because i think often these discussions get framed in an adversarial way, as joyce and others have described, and perhaps even beyond the adversarial feelings is some level of anxiety or fear on the part of the parent?  similar to fear over non-reading, or &quot;never learning math&quot;, etc.  <br/>

<br/>
You might contact them.<br/>
<br/>
If you have electric water heating - turning down the temperature just a <br/>
degree or two can save a lot. If you have anything that &quot;heats&quot; with <br/>
electricity, that is your source of big potential savings. Waterbed <br/>
heaters, pool heaters, floor heaters, etc.<br/>

that the most expensive electrical appliance we have, the item that, by<br/>
far, costs the most money is the water heater.  I know this because our<br/>
previous house had a gas water heater, and while our gas bill was<br/>
slightly higher than it is now, our electric bill was tiny.  When we<br/>
moved our electric bill tripled in size even though it&#39;s a smaller<br/>
house.  The ONLY difference is the water heater.  We even have a new<br/>
energy efficient water heater and it&#39;s still very expensive!<br/>
<br/>
Everything else, computers, lights, fans, stove, fridge, freezer is<br/>
nothing on that water heater.  If it was a house I owned instead of<br/>
rented, I would seriously consider buying point source water heaters,<br/>
the kind that most people in Europe and Japan, and possibly other<br/>
places, have.   Then I&#39;d also have the added bonus of more closet space!</div>
