&lt;&lt; Now, this is not my style at all. (Is this his version of adolescent <br/>
 rebellion?) But I am so impressed at Julian&#39;s ability to find what works for <br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
