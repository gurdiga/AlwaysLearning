<div id="ygrps-yiv-1071600527">This is a question I decided to send to this list in addition to another<br/>
list:<br/>
OK, Here is my question (Please be gentle with your answers! LOL)<br/>
Once the above (the above was a statement regarding kids that through<br/>
tantrums to get what they want in stores and the writer&#39;s opinion that it is<br/>
due to the parent not being consistant in their responses thereby increasing<br/>
the child&#39;s tantrum - totally paraphrased) has become a pattern - how does<br/>
one change it? How does one set the limit yet still maintain respect and teh<br/>
child autonomy? I tend to have good days (respecting their wishes, everyone<br/>
cooperating, watching the hunger/anger/lonely/tired thing, modeling behavior<br/>
and then all of a sudden I realize that there has been some yelling,<br/>
disrespect etc and I&#39;m not sure what got us there.<br/>
Also, the eating issue (I really wish S was here to answer this one) My two<br/>
year old is down to eating nothing until he gets junk. Would removing it<br/>
from the house for a period of time help? Might it give him the space to try<br/>
other healthier foods and realize he likes them? I don&#39;t want to be a food<br/>
controller yet I am starting to become concerned over his eating habits.<br/>
Yesterday he ate a bowl of rice crispies with milk and then nothing else! He<br/>
is still nursing so that eases my fear somewhat. I have also thought about<br/>
not arguing and letting him nurse as much as desired but I am at that<br/>
nursing stage where it is starting to get a little irritating physically as<br/>
my cycle ebbs and flows (pun intended LOL)<br/>

*days*? I have good *mornings* that degenerate into yelling, disrespect, and 
(the recent favorite) the Disgruntled Glare. Yesterday was such a day. Had I 
been dh, ds10 would have been grounded for at least a week. Since I try not to 
resort to meaningless retribution, I got him out of the situation, let him stew 
awhile, and by evening, I was walking by the couch where he was sitting and he 
said quietly, &quot;I love you,&quot; whereupon I gave him a big ol&#39; hug, the kind that 
ds10s hate (in public, anyway.) Now I know yours is two and mine is ten, but the 
principle is the same. I try to stop and feel where they are, when I haven&#39;t and 
I&#39;ve been an ogre, I apologize. When mine was that age and I blew up, I&#39;d put 
myself in time out and tell him so. The novelty was enough to stop the behavior 
and he wanted to comfort me. Setting limits is just the household rules, which 
apply to everyone: respect others&#39; property, use appropriate language, keep up 
with your responsibilities. I have to show him that I do that myself, as well as 
showing what I do when I screw up. Please don&#39;t be a perfect mother; I had one 
(still do) and I&#39;m still getting over it.</font></span></div>

as the junk food; toddlers need surprisingly little food volume and variety 
isn&#39;t a concern yet. As long as he&#39;s not underweight (if he is, this is a 
medical issue instead) then I would offer a selection of foods and stand back. 
I&#39;ve never harped on the issue, and&nbsp;I&#39;m fortunate that it&#39;s not (much of) 
an problem here. You can find &quot;junky&quot; looking foods that aren&#39;t too bad, 
health-nut-wise, just check out the cereal and cookie aisle at your neighborhood 
health food store. If all he wanted was rice krispies and milk three times a 
day, that&#39;s not so bad either, just throw in a multivitamin now and then. And is 
he old enough to have his own lower shelf in the kitchen that you can stock with 
whatever he&#39;ll eat? (Plus a few of your own selections, of course!) It&#39;s all 
about control at that age; take yourself out of the loop as much as possible.

I think I will do this. He really likes tht he can now open the pantry door<br/>
and take out food. I think I will use the bottom shelf for snacks.<br/>
Great idea!<br/>

<br>Have you tried the happy-face method? &nbsp;(Pancakes in artsy shapes, with Mickey-Mouse ears; open-faced cheese sandwiches with design with different colored cheeses?)
<br>
<br>Have you gone to the store hunting for JUST special, new foods he might like?
<br>

<br>is still nursing so that eases my fear somewhat. -=-
<br>
<br>We used to make (still do, but the concept started then, after a zoo trip) &quot;monkey platters&quot; for the kids. &nbsp;Maraschino (sp?) cherries, little pieces of pineapple (there is some now shaped like moons and stars), tiny crackers, like Goldfish or I forget the little square orange ones), little squares of cheese (smaller than normal), grapes... &nbsp;Give them toothpicks to eat the stuff with, if they&#39;re old enough to be safe with toothpicks.

<br>-=-statement regarding kids that through
<br>tantrums to get what they want in stores . . . &nbsp;how does
<br>one change it? How does one set the limit yet still maintain respect and teh
<br>child autonomy?-=-
<br>
<br>In-store strategies: &nbsp;Interact with the child more instead of leaving the store to entertain him. &nbsp;&nbsp;Carry him so his head is near yours, or have him in the cart facing you, and keep up a conversation about things other than the store, or talk to him about what you&#39;re buying and why if it&#39;s the grocery store.
<br>
<br>Go to a checkout with boring stuff on the sides if they have one--lots of stores do, just because kids are unlikely to beg for emery boards and razors and lighters and stuff.
<br>
<br>Let him hold something interesting that you&#39;re buying, something unbreakable but colorful and fun.
<br>
<br>Praise him for being helpful. &nbsp;Tell him it&#39;s fun to go with him so you have someone to talk to. &nbsp;Make him feel a help instead of a hindrance.
<br>
<br>If he&#39;s older and in the habit of begging and crying, talk about it being stressful, and that you don&#39;t WANT to wish to be alone, but that the crying makes it no fun for you to go to the store. &nbsp;&nbsp;He&#39;ll forget, and he&#39;ll lapse, but you can say &quot;I don&#39;t want you to come if you&#39;re going to cry.&quot; &nbsp;Then don&#39;t consider it a binding contract if he&#39;s little and fails to maintain himself. &nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Sometimes get him cool things when he doesn&#39;t ask for them, and tell him it&#39;s because he was so good in the store. &nbsp;Or just say you thought he might really like that, and surprise him.
<br>
<br>If my husband shamed me when we went shopping and complained about taking me when we got home, I&#39;d want loot to show for my mental anguish. &nbsp;Some families are not very nice to their kids in/around/after stores, in my experience. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>So not knowing the particulars of the situation and not being around for the prior discussion where it first took place, there are some ideas of mine.

<br>
<br>Ah - memories.....
<br>
<br>As soon as we got to the grocery store we&#39;d go to the bags of dry beans and split peas and stuff like that. They&#39;d pick out a &quot;baby.&quot; They cuddle and play with their bag of beans all through the store - talk to it and sing to it and so on. I don&#39;t know how this whole thing started - I think it was by accident with my oldest and she passed it down to the younger kids.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-801069060">What does your mother think about all of<br/>
this?<br/>
<br/>
I know my parents indicated that they felt<br/>
their last visit here was harder because they<br/>
felt torn between the two sets of grandkids.<br/>
I tried very hard not to make them feel like<br/>
they had to balance their time perfectly, and<br/>
that we all knew that things would balance<br/>
out over time (years).  But when we suggested<br/>
that I save my vacation to go to New Mexico<br/>
next Christmas, and spend time there, (and<br/>
woudl that be ok, to have christmas at their<br/>
house), they were very happy.  They said it<br/>
was easier to not have to deal with trying to<br/>
balance the time.  So that is our plan.  I<br/>
think having vacations where each set of<br/>
grandkids gets the grandparents/mother/father<br/>
to him/her/themselves is a good idea.  My<br/>
parents even try to spend time alone with<br/>
each grandchild, ie, Lexie goes with them for<br/>
a special time and then a few days later,<br/>
they take Janene for special one on one time,<br/>
doing something that child wants to do.  I<br/>
think it would be hard to be a grandparent<br/>
and make sure the time is balanced.<br/>

&gt; on an issue with my SIL<br/>
&gt; and niece, so I thought I&#39;d throw it out to<br/>
&gt; you all, and get opinions.<br/>
&gt; My niece goes to PS and my SIL teaches 4th<br/>
&gt; grade.  My SIL and I<br/>
&gt; started out with the same parenting beliefs<br/>
&gt; (fam bed, BF...) in fact,<br/>
&gt; she influenced me a lot.  Ordered me<br/>
&gt; Mothering, told me about LLL.<br/>
&gt; Anyway, over the years, we have gone in<br/>
&gt; different directions, but<br/>
&gt; have remained good friends, though our busy<br/>
&gt; separate lives, keep us<br/>
&gt; from seeing each other very much.<br/>
&gt; Their family dynamics are pretty different<br/>
&gt; from ours. My niece is in<br/>
&gt; 7th grade and is going through all that<br/>
&gt; stuff(crap) that goes on<br/>
&gt; socially for kids in school.  She has been<br/>
&gt; dealing with lots of<br/>
&gt; school/social stuff for years, but they<br/>
&gt; think it&#39;s all normal, and<br/>
&gt; necessary for a healthy<br/>
&gt; upbringing..yada,yada...  My niece just<br/>
&gt; made<br/>
&gt; the honor role.  She excels academically.<br/>
&gt; I have a good relationship with my niece.<br/>
&gt; I like her a lot, and we<br/>
&gt; get along well.  We talk a lot, and joke<br/>
&gt; around a lot.  She comes<br/>
&gt; over just to hang out and play with my<br/>
&gt; little ones.  But we&#39;ve had<br/>
&gt; one issue that keeps coming between us.  My<br/>
&gt; mother!  My mom and I<br/>
&gt; have gotten really close over the past 5<br/>
&gt; years or so.  She stopped<br/>
&gt; working, I started homeschooling and we<br/>
&gt; have been able to get<br/>
&gt; together quite a bit because of this.  My<br/>
&gt; mom lives in FL(I live in<br/>
&gt; MD), so I visit every winter, sometimes<br/>
&gt; twice(this year, it looks<br/>
&gt; like 3 times.  She comes up and spends the<br/>
&gt; summer in our resort town<br/>
&gt; in her own apt. and we spend most days at<br/>
&gt; the beach with her.  My<br/>
&gt; children adore her, and so do I really.  My<br/>
&gt; niece has a lot of<br/>
&gt; problems with all the time we get to spend<br/>
&gt; with her, and she doesn&#39;t.<br/>
&gt; She has made it clear over the years that<br/>
&gt; we have infringed on her<br/>
&gt; private Grandmom time.  We&#39;ll come to the<br/>
&gt; beach one day, and she&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; roll her eyes at the fact that we are<br/>
&gt; there.  She complains loudly<br/>
&gt; about the fact that we always get to go to<br/>
&gt; FL and visit.  My mom<br/>
&gt; tries to make special times with just her,<br/>
&gt; but has come to feel that<br/>
&gt; my niece can be a little obnoxious about<br/>
&gt; the way she expresses her<br/>
&gt; rights to have her to herself, orto  have<br/>
&gt; equal time.  So every time<br/>
&gt; my kids get to see her,  my mother is<br/>
&gt; suppose to make sure my niece<br/>
&gt; gets as many times spent with her too.<br/>
&gt; I can understand this, coming from the mind<br/>
&gt; of a 12 year old, but my<br/>
&gt; SIL seems to encourage this behavior.  She<br/>
&gt; makes comments to me about<br/>
&gt; my nieces feelings, and how much time we<br/>
&gt; get to spend with my mom.<br/>
&gt; She seems to be implying I should purposely<br/>
&gt; spend less time with my<br/>
&gt; mom to make it fair for her daughter.<br/>
&gt; My first thoughts to these incedents are,<br/>
&gt; &quot;tough!&quot;.  We chose to have<br/>
&gt; a free lifestyle,  my mother encourages us<br/>
&gt; to come, and invites us to<br/>
&gt; do things, and loves being with my kids,<br/>
&gt; and has always made that<br/>
&gt; clear, why should I change anything!?<br/>
&gt; Boy this is getting long.<br/>
&gt; Well the latest is, my mom suggested we<br/>
&gt; come for Easter this year.<br/>
&gt; My 11yo dd said she wanted to have Easter<br/>
&gt; at our house, so we said we<br/>
&gt; would come a different time.  Then we found<br/>
&gt; out my dh was going to be<br/>
&gt; away for Easter, and my dd siad that going<br/>
&gt; to FL would be better than<br/>
&gt; being here without dad.  My mother was here<br/>
&gt; for a funeral, and I had<br/>
&gt; taken my dd and my niece to the funeral 1<br/>
&gt; 1/2 hrs away and met my<br/>
&gt; mother there.  The girls drove back with<br/>
&gt; her, and my niece made plans<br/>
&gt; to come to FL over Easter for her spring<br/>
&gt; break.  She wanted my dd to<br/>
&gt; come too, but my dd didn&#39;t want to.  So a<br/>
&gt; few days after this, we<br/>
&gt; deide that going for Easter would be fun,<br/>
&gt; and I didn&#39;t realize my<br/>
&gt; niece was planning on going(niether did my<br/>
&gt; mother, because they had<br/>
&gt; had the one conversation, and she hadn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; heard from her or my SIL<br/>
&gt; again about it.  So when I called to say,<br/>
&gt; that we changed our minds<br/>
&gt; and would be coming, she was very happy.<br/>
&gt; Then last night my SIL<br/>
&gt; called and when I told her we were going<br/>
&gt; for Easter, she told my<br/>
&gt; niece, and my niece stormed off into her<br/>
&gt; room, apparently devistated<br/>
&gt; by the fact that we all would bbe there<br/>
&gt; too, and that would RUIN her<br/>
&gt; time.<br/>
&gt; My SIL was telling me all of this, and I<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t know what to say.  I<br/>
&gt; was kind of ticked and thought she was<br/>
&gt; being rude to imply that maybe<br/>
&gt; we should change our plans now.  I have 4<br/>
&gt; kids and we had already<br/>
&gt; discussed that we would be going for<br/>
&gt; Easter.  My 11yo was infuriated<br/>
&gt; that my niece would act like this(once<br/>
&gt; again) and she was saying that<br/>
&gt; if we changed our plans for someone who was<br/>
&gt; being rude and selfish,<br/>
&gt; that SHE would have a fit to.  Well, she<br/>
&gt; did.  We spent the entire<br/>
&gt; evening discussing it, and I decided I<br/>
&gt; would have no fun being there,<br/>
&gt; knowing my niece wouldn&#39;t want us there.<br/>
&gt; My niece called and talked<br/>
&gt; to my dd, and said she wasn&#39;t going to go<br/>
&gt; at Easter and would pick<br/>
&gt; another time to go (my dd thought she was<br/>
&gt; being a big baby, but I<br/>
&gt; thought she actually made a good decision,<br/>
&gt; probably with the help of<br/>
&gt; her mother)I decided that since we are the<br/>
&gt; ones that have the<br/>
&gt; freedom, that we could choose another time<br/>
&gt; to go, since it was so<br/>
&gt; important to her, to not have all of us<br/>
&gt; there.  My dd reluctantly<br/>
&gt; agreed, with the promise of us getting to<br/>
&gt; go twice(once when my<br/>
&gt; parents wouldn&#39;t be there and we would<br/>
&gt; house sit, then again, after<br/>
&gt; Easter.  My niece immediately felt bad,<br/>
&gt; that we changed our plans for<br/>
&gt; her.  I think my SIL did too.  She told me<br/>
&gt; that my niece said &quot;now I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t want to go at all! and started to<br/>
&gt; cry.<br/>
&gt; They called this morning with new plans and<br/>
&gt; we are still working out<br/>
&gt; the details.  Though we&#39;re still not going<br/>
&gt; for Easter.<br/>
&gt; I was a little hurt by my niece, and angry<br/>
&gt; at my SIL handling of her<br/>
&gt; daughters attitude about it all, but I bit<br/>
&gt; the bullet and put on a<br/>
&gt; happy face and said it was all fine.  And<br/>
&gt; really it mostly is.  I<br/>
&gt; feel better.  The behavoir and attitude is<br/>
&gt; theirs to deal with now,<br/>
&gt; and it will all work out fine.<br/>
&gt; I just have a nagging feeling, I have just<br/>
&gt; justified my nieces<br/>
&gt; behavior, and I still feel hurt at the fact<br/>
&gt; that she can so easily<br/>
&gt; let us know how much she doesn&#39;t want us<br/>
&gt; around at times.<br/>
&gt; I can see how having 4 kids around ages 2<br/>
&gt; to 11 can very much change<br/>
&gt; the dynamics of any environment, but I<br/>
&gt; still think it&#39;s rude to<br/>
&gt; express those feelings.<br/>
&gt; Anyway, it&#39;s pretty much over now, and I am<br/>
&gt; doing my best to not have<br/>
&gt; any hard feelings about it all.  They are<br/>
&gt; still very important to me,<br/>
&gt; and I guess that is why it hurts a little.<br/>
&gt; It always makes me feel better to type it<br/>
&gt; all out.  I usually end up<br/>
&gt; deleting what I write, because I figure out<br/>
&gt; my feelings by the end,<br/>
&gt; but I&#39;m still going to send this one.<br/>

<br/>
  Hi all<br/>
  I haven&#39;t posted here for quite a long time.  <br/>
  I don&#39;t really know why I&#39;m posting now.  I think I want to try to <br/>
  get back to some kind of normal here, and am hoping a little <br/>
  discussion might help.  My son Sam fell through the ice at a local <br/>
  park while there with a friend and his family.  He left at 1:00 that <br/>
  afternoon and at 5:30 we recieved the phone call.  That was Jan. 19, <br/>
  and I&#39;m still trying to accept that he&#39;s not coming home.   I&#39;m not <br/>
  ready to write about it yet.  I want to write a journal, but haven&#39;t <br/>
  been able to put much down.<br/>
  What I do want to write about here is how absolutely grateful I have <br/>
  felt about unschooling.  It was one of the first thoughts that came <br/>
  into my mind when I started to be able to think again.  Thank God we <br/>
  found this path.  Thank God not a minute was wasted.  I&#39;m not <br/>
  religious, though I find myself in a state of transition when it <br/>
  comes to my spirituality.  But I don&#39;t know who else to thank. <br/>
  Though I do want to thank all of you people who have helped me on <br/>
  this journey.  I don&#39;t need to explain here what I mean by all of <br/>
  this.  We know what we&#39;re doing here when it comes to giving our <br/>
  children real lives.  Lives spent full of joy and wonder.  That&#39;s how <br/>
  Sam has been described over and over.  Full of joy.<br/>
  Our whole town came out in support of us.  It was beautiful and <br/>
  overwhelming.  I&#39;m still getting it.<br/>
  We recieved donations and we&#39;re taking our time, but we want to give <br/>
  in him name through the years.  While many people are on a campaign <br/>
  to try to prevent tragedies like this from happening again, I keep <br/>
  coming to the thought of trying to find a way to help parents really <br/>
  understand how precious every minute is with their children.  <br/>
  Appreciating the here and now.  Death comes when it will, so take <br/>
  advantage of the now. <br/>
  I have 3 other children and life is moving forward.  We still find <br/>
  lots of joy in it.  Our picture is in the photos section here if you <br/>
  want to see Sammy, (or any of us).<br/>
  I wrote this here because this is the most peaceful and wise list I <br/>
  know of.  I want to express my thanks and remind the people who have <br/>
  selflessly given of their time and wisdom over the years just how<br/>
  important they are.  You changed my life and you helped to make Sams <br/>
  life so worthwhile and meaningful and full of joy.<br/>
  I wrote this without crying, and am not looking for condolences.<br/>
  Just giving thanks and maybe creating some discussion of how lucky we <br/>
  all are to unschool.  (and &quot;un&quot; so much of the other crap that isn&#39;t <br/>
  REAL in this world)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, good for you that you wrote what you wanted to say without crying, but<br/>
as for me reading it - I couldn&#39;t help the tears welling up in my eyes!<br/>
<br/>
Joanna, you don&#39;t know me but I&#39;ve read your posts for over a year now  -<br/>
here and at unschooling-dotcom and the message boards. I&#39;ve gained a lot<br/>
from your writing and perspective and could always tell that you really<br/>
*got* unschooling and lived life joyfully with your family. I always looked<br/>
forward to reading your opinions on various subjects -  believe it or not!<br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When the news of your son&#39;s death was posted last month, I was very saddened<br/>
and affected by the knowledge of what happened. I know you said you aren&#39;t<br/>
looked for condolences, but I am so truly sorry for your loss and my heart<br/>
aches for you. But I must also say that you are truly amazing and inspiring<br/>
for writing here with such courage and with words of strength, acceptance<br/>
and peace about what happened to you and your family. I really admire your<br/>
attitude about *everything*, in spite of your loss. I only hope that if I am<br/>
ever faced with any sort of circumstances similar to yours, that I would<br/>
have the perspective that you have spoken of here, just now.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for writing and sharing and checking in. Thanks for being an<br/>
incredible human being.<br/>
<br/>
Take Care,<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I know what you mean by this, but it didn&#39;t seem to apply to the original <br/>
ramp and shelf questions very well.**<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been imagining an outdoor ramp, but was an indoor ramp intended?<br/>
<br/>
I would automatically tell a shelf climbing kid &quot;We can&#39;t climb in the store.&quot;  And I might add  &quot;That shelf isn&#39;t designed for climbing.&quot;  But I&#39;d most likely ONLY stop a kid from running (on an outdoor ramp) if there were other people who could be jostled or annoyed.   I guess I (baselessly) think of outdoor spaces as public, and I&#39;m less deferential to the rule creating body.  Sure, I follow the prescribed rules at swimming pools (walk, don&#39;t run), but I&#39;m having a harder time respecting a ramp usage rule for an outdoor ramp.  (I&#39;m specifically visualizing a ramp that is part of the sidewalk from a building used by the public on the way to the parking lot.  Different rules for different ramps.)<br/>

&gt; He&#39;s running down a sidewalk incline with a big sign that says &quot;no<br/>
&gt; Running&quot; Should I:<br/>
&gt; 1) Ignore it, console him if he falls down<br/>
&gt; 2) Ask him to read the sign<br/>
&gt; 3) say something like &quot;don&#39;t run&quot;<br/>
&gt; 4) say something like &quot;please stop running, it&#39;s dangerous to run<br/>
&gt; down an incline like this&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are often more than four choices in a given situation.<br/>
<br/>
It depends. Is the sign there because usually there is a huge crowd on the<br/>
weekends and running would be a danger and nuisance, but today is Monday<br/>
mid-morning and the sidewalk is deserted and there&#39;s no problem whatsoever<br/>
with him running? Or is it Saturday afternoon and the crowd is massive and<br/>
surly? Is the incline just a little bit and not necessarily dangerous, or<br/>
would anybody short of a mountain goat fall on it and break something? Did I<br/>
know he needed to run off energy AND that I was taking him to a place<br/>
dangerous to do so, and if so, why did I make that decision?<br/>
<br/>
My answer is: 5) Parent thoughtfully, take into consideration my child&#39;s<br/>
wants and needs versus the chances of him actually being in danger or a<br/>
serious nuisance to other people&#39;s right to walk peacefully down a sidewalk,<br/>
and act accordingly. My reaction would be the same if an adult friend or my<br/>
husband were the one I was worried about running down the incline.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; another example: He&#39;s standing on a shelf in a department store,<br/>
&gt; should I:<br/>
&gt; 1) Ignore it, pray silently to myself that he doesn&#39;t break it<br/>
&gt; 2) say something like &quot;is standing on a shelf a safe and<br/>
&gt; appropriate thing to do?&quot;<br/>
&gt; 3) say something like &quot;don&#39;t stand on store shelves&quot;<br/>
&gt; 4) say something like &quot;Please get down, you could break that&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What does the shelf normally hold? Is it a shelf where they keep couches<br/>
that is currently empty and is 1&quot; off the floor and nobody would care if he<br/>
was standing on it? Or is it a flexible/fragile shelf that clearly a sturdy<br/>
boy could very well break? And was I aware in advance that he wanted to<br/>
climb and balance on things and instead I&#39;m meandering through a shopping<br/>
trip I could have put off until my husband got home to look after him, or<br/>
did he really want to come on this shopping trip (and if so, why, and what<br/>
was he hoping would happen, and once I see he&#39;s not enjoying it how can I<br/>
bring it to as swift an end as possible?)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I often see parents drag their children along to places and errands that the<br/>
child has no interest in and could be done at other times. In dog training<br/>
;) I used to tell my clients that preventing opportunities for poor behavior<br/>
in puppies and young dogs was 99.9% of the secret of raising a good dog.<br/>
While kids aren&#39;t dogs, the basic &quot;prevent the problem in the first place&quot;<br/>
philosophy works well for us, as does the idea that setting someone up to<br/>
fail is unfair.<br/>

He&#39;s running down a sidewalk incline with a big sign that says &quot;no<br/>
<br/>
Running&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
If I wanted to let him run, I would go down below him and let him run toward <br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
If there were other people there I would say &quot;Stop running.&quot;  Two reasons:  <br/>
he could knock someone else down, and it sets a bad example for other kids and <br/>
irritates people.  People have a right not to be irritated to some extent.<br/>
<br/>
If he lusted for that ramp, I&#39;d bring him back after hours and let him run, <br/>
run, run.  (I&#39;d double check his shoe laces, and I would take bandaids and <br/>
antibiotics, and I would try to get him to wear thick pants, and not favorite <br/>
pants.)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Should I:<br/>
<br/>
1) Ignore it, console him if he falls down&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe on the first, definitely on the latter.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;2) Ask him to read the sign&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Would you say to your husband or an adult friend &quot;read the sign&quot;?  You would <br/>
probably say &quot;There&#39;s a sign here that says &#39;don&#39;t run&#39;.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;3) say something like &quot;don&#39;t run&quot;&gt;&gt;   Maybe; depends; probably.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;4) say something like &quot;please stop running, it&#39;s dangerous to run<br/>
<br/>
down an incline like this&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well you could say people get hurt on inclines and you&#39;d hate to have to take <br/>
him to the hospital.  But generally &quot;please stop running, it&#39;s dangerous to <br/>
run<br/>
<br/>
down an incline like this&quot; is WAY too many words.   If it&#39;s dangerous, go <br/>
with &quot;Stop&quot; or &quot;don&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=another example: He&#39;s standing on a shelf in a department store,<br/>
<br/>
should I:<br/>
<br/>
1) Ignore it, pray silently to myself that he doesn&#39;t break it<br/>
<br/>
2) say something like &quot;is standing on a shelf a safe and<br/>
<br/>
appropriate thing to do?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
3) say something like &quot;don&#39;t stand on store shelves&quot;<br/>
<br/>
4) say something like &quot;Please get down, you could break that&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
I would say &quot;Get down.&quot;  I wouldn&#39;t say please.  I wouldn&#39;t quiz him about <br/>
what&#39;s safe or appropriate.  If you want him to have the experience of standing <br/>
on a shelf, buy your own shelf, or build some at home, but don&#39;t let him stand <br/>
on other people&#39;s shelves.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I keep reading more books (currently reading John Holt - Freedom and <br/>
<br/>
Beyond and I think its the most confusing yet) and none of them can <br/>
<br/>
seem to agree which approach is better, URGH! Please help.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Why should they agree?  I see several people have already answered this <br/>
before I did.  I&#39;m not looking until after I post.  We probably won&#39;t agree.   Your <br/>
job is to read it and see what makes the most sense for you and your own <br/>
integrity and conscience.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I, too, want my children to make their own decisions....and I don&#39;t want<br/>
them to &#39;blindly follow rules&#39; , however.....I do think that one can teach<br/>
children to think for themselves while still learning to appreciate why a<br/>
rule exists.  And though I don&#39;t want my children to blindly follow an adult<br/>
(or another child, for that matter) I do hope they can learn to respect<br/>
differences.   We have all kinds of friends, and being &#39;liberal&#39; as far as<br/>
parenting goes, many of our friends have more rules then we have. I would<br/>
never encourage my kids to break other people&#39;s rules in their homes just<br/>
because we disagree with it. We respect their right to make whatever rules<br/>
they want in their own homes. If we enjoy their company enough to want to<br/>
spend time with them in their home, then we will live with their rules while<br/>
there.  Obviously, I don&#39;t mean following rules that I think will harm my<br/>
children. I&#39;m thinking of things like having to sit at the table until<br/>
everyone is done eating.  Or not being able to watch certain shows at their<br/>
house.  As far as rules in society....we have many discussions about why the<br/>
rule is there. Who is the rule protecting (often it&#39;s more to protect<br/>
someone from litigation than from actual harm to a participant), what<br/>
happens if you break the rule (both personally, i.e.. injury, or legally,<br/>
i.e.. a ticket, maybe being asked to leave,  or maybe nothing will happen),<br/>
that sort of thing.  Teaching kids to respect rules and laws does not mean<br/>
we have to teach blind obedience.  We also talk about lots of the rules and<br/>
laws that exist that society turns a blind eye to. No one drives the speed<br/>
limit on the express ways in our area.  Our current pet peeve rule is that<br/>
my 15 yod cannot go to an R rated movie without me being present.  I don&#39;t<br/>
like the theaters deciding that I have to be there. I don&#39;t like most R<br/>
movies and have little desire to go.  To me, it&#39;s a stupid rule. Do I<br/>
understand why it&#39;s there? Sure. But I still disagree. Do we break it?<br/>
Depends....sometimes they have a &#39;don&#39;t ask, don&#39;t tell&#39; philosophy and she<br/>
can get in. Other times, they ask for Id...then she&#39;s out of luck if I<br/>
didn&#39;t happen to be the one to drive her.  It&#39;s pretty arbitrary, depending<br/>
on the mood of who&#39;s collecting tickets.  And then again....would I want a<br/>
society with no rules or laws?  Would I want to visit a home that didn&#39;t<br/>
have some kind of standard of behavior? (I&#39;ve seen homes like that...it&#39;s<br/>
not a pretty sight!)  I don&#39;t want my kids to &#39;blindly&#39; follow rules, but<br/>
nor do I want my kids to &#39;blindly&#39; break rules without any thought.<br/>

want them to blindly follow rules.  I also don&#39;t say I want them to <br/>
blindly follow what adults say, simply because they are adults.  I want <br/>
them to think for themselves. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, not morality, but for thinking.  Many rules are there for a reason. <br/>
They are logical and reasonable and enforcable.  Other rules are there <br/>
for no reason.  For instance, in our townhome, there is a rule that no <br/>
one under 14 can be in the hot tub, ever.  When we researched this and <br/>
asked them why there was a rule, they came up with a lot of &quot;real&quot; <br/>
sounding answers.  Children over heat easily.  Children might pee in the <br/>
hot tub.  Upon really looking at this, we discovered that older adults <br/>
also might pee in the tub.  Also, older adults are often more prone to <br/>
overheating because of medical problems.  Furthermore, older adults are <br/>
likely to have more issues with hot tubs when drugs or alcohol are being <br/>
used.  There are  no dangers for children in hot tubs as long as they <br/>
are following rules which keep them safe.  So, their reasons for their <br/>
rule was not logical.  It was not reasonable.  We went to a board <br/>
meeting and gave them page after page about how children are safe in hot <br/>
tubs if reasonable caution is observed, such as not staying in for <br/>
longer than about 10 minutes, which are, by the way, the same guidelines <br/>
for everyone else.  We petitioned the board to change the rule.  They <br/>
did not.  So, we talked to the girls about civil disobdience.  We found <br/>
out what would happen if they violated the rule (we&#39;d loose swimming <br/>
privledges for a month).  The girls made the decision that they did not <br/>
want to get into the hot tub that much, but would instead rather follow <br/>
the rules, so they could swim in the pool.  THAT is an informed decision. <br/>
<br/>
My ch ildren don&#39;t stand on shelving in grocery stores.  I don&#39;t think <br/>
they ever would even do that.  But they don&#39;t NOT do it because it&#39;s a <br/>
rule.  They don&#39;t do it because it&#39;s not safe, it could hurt a person, <br/>
or thing, or cause damage which would cost money to fix.  My children <br/>
are reasonable human beings who, when asked not to do something that is <br/>
reasonable, don&#39;t do it.  It doesn&#39;t matter who tells them.  They can <br/>
understand why running down stairs might be dangerous.  They can <br/>
understand why running down a ramp might be dangerous. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I find it interesting that this is coming from you, Sandra.  If they are <br/>
visiting someone&#39;s house, and that house is filled with a great deal of <br/>
fragile items, I would mention this fact upon my knowing this fact.  <br/>
&quot;Janene, this man&#39;s house is filled with great items that are about 300 <br/>
years old, can we look with our eyes?  It would be horrid to drop <br/>
something that is not replacable, so it&#39;s easier to look with our eyes, <br/>
even mommy, than to risk such a thing.&quot;  My children, being reasonable <br/>
humans who are generally respected and are thoughtful individuals, would <br/>
see the sense to such a request.  It doesn&#39;t have to be RULE, it&#39;s <br/>
common sense.  It&#39;s also common sense that if there is a child, Janene <br/>
perhaps, who just has a harder time being quiet and gentle and such, <br/>
then she probably needs to not go into the room with fragile items. <br/>
<br/>
I do think some rules are arbitrary and wrong  I don&#39;t think anyone, <br/>
including children, should just follow rules.  I think they s hould <br/>
think for themselves, and decide for themselves.  And I don&#39;t think <br/>
people should make up rules simply to have rules.  I would assume that <br/>
if you don&#39;t want people to run down your stairs, there is a reason.   I <br/>
also think that if you told my children that rule, and Lexie said &quot;what <br/>
is the reason behind your rule?&quot; you would answer that question and have <br/>
a reasonable answer.  Lexie would see the logic in that rule and so <br/>
therefore following that rule would not be an issue.  Same for shelves <br/>
in a store.  Logically it makes no sense to climb on these, because the <br/>
consequences might be someone gets hurt or property is damaged.  <br/>
Reasonable children who are treated with respect can understand <br/>
reasonable rules, even if unwritten, and follow those rules.<br/>

anyone who knows me knows I don&#39;t unparent.  I try hard to always treat <br/>
my children with respect and dignity, as though they are complete and <br/>
whole beings (no less whole than I, who is also still learning and <br/>
growing). <br/>

would have absolutely no problem following them, because they are also <br/>
reasonable.  However, if you put a big dish m&ms down in front of my <br/>
kids and said &quot;these m&ms are for adults who are over 50 years old only <br/>
and no one else may touch them, I have no reason for that rule, I just <br/>
do it because I like to control people&quot;, both my children and I would <br/>
probably find some reason to leave rather quickly and would also <br/>
probably find a store pretty quickly to buy our own m&ms.  Sure, they <br/>
are your m&ms, and sure, it&#39;s your house, and sure, it&#39;s your rule.  But <br/>
that doesn&#39;t mean we have to be there--in that case you can have your <br/>
rights over your space and property, we&#39;ll go to a park and eat m&ms by <br/>
ourselves! <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But you need to quote me correctly.  There is a very important word <br/>
missing--blindly.  I do teach my children to never BLINDLY follow <br/>
rules.  I do teach my children to never BLINDLY trust an adult, simply <br/>
because they are an adult.  I do want them to question authority.  I do <br/>
want them to make informed choices.  Sometimes my kids follow rules <br/>
about which they don&#39;t agree, simply because they want to participate in <br/>
an activity (such as not getting in the hot tub because they wish to <br/>
swim in the regular pool).  Other times we fudge things a bit so they <br/>
can participate (like saying Janene is in 1st grade this year so she can <br/>
be a Girl Scout Brownie, when she really would be, if she were in <br/>
school, a K.  Or saying Lexie is 9, instead of 8, so she can participate <br/>
as a pre-teen at the conference.)  Personally, I think it&#39;s good common <br/>
sense for people to think for themselves.  Most of the time, my kids <br/>
follow the rules, or do as an adult has asked them to do, because the <br/>
rule and request are reasonable.  Sometimes they do it because it&#39;s too <br/>
much bother to do otherwise--learning to pick their battles is another <br/>
important lesson. <br/>
<br/>
A friend once said that she wanted her children to learn two <br/>
things--question authority and consider the source.  Here is my list, or <br/>
probably the beginning of my list...<br/>
<br/>
Question authority<br/>
Consider the source<br/>
Make informed decisions<br/>
Pick battles carefully<br/>
<br/>
One of the greatest things I see about homeschooling, is that there <br/>
doesn&#39;t seem to be the need for a bunch of rules, which schools, and <br/>
parents of schooled children, need--to simply control the masses.  As a <br/>
teacher of 30 kids, I need a bunch of rules to control the herd.  As a <br/>
parent of two, especially as those two are treated with respect, and are <br/>
reasonable humans who honor logic, there is little need for rules.  <br/>
Instead, we can simply talk about the situation, and make informed <br/>
decisions about the best way to proceed. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1780967876">Sylvia - I&#39;m curious--What ages are these children that your mother has decided you are ruining for life?  Just a guess, but I bet you are putting a lot more thought into how you are being with your kids than she did when you were little.    If you are putting this much thought into your parenting skills, I think you must be a one good mom! <br/>
Just because your oldest is going through some rough times, doesn&#39;t mean you have &quot;failed&quot; as a parent.  <br/>
    You&#39;ve used this &quot;pond&quot; thingy as an example.  It reminds me of a Thomas the Tank Engine episode where Thomas didn&#39;t feel like heeding a sign that said &quot;Danger&quot; and he wound up falling into some water.  The idea the writer was trying to get across was that sometimes you don&#39;t know why the rule is there, so it&#39;s best to follow it.  I&#39;ve heard things like that pond called an attractive nusiance.  My husband had to put a huge (expensive) fence around something just like that in a subdivision he was building.  The city required the fence because kids aren&#39;t going to read a sign and they aren&#39;t going to figure out how dangerous that thing is until they&#39;ve already fallen in.  <br/>
    I am trying to give my kids as much freedom as I can, but I can think of  *lots* of things they can&#39;t do.  They are 11 and 9, so I can explain to them when I&#39;m acting based on my own insecurities. They have their own quirky worries, too, which I try to respect, so they are patient with mine.  There are lots of situations, though, where I still just have to tell them to &quot;Stop that.&quot;  Maybe I can explain later what the deal was, but when they were toddlers, I needed them to &quot;mind me&quot; immediately for safety reasons.  For example, I can&#39;t let a toddler run in a busy parking lot.   I guess the overall principle is that my job is to keep them safe.  As they get older, they take on some of that responsibility for themselves, just like they start doing more and more about getting fed.  And that&#39;s a real balancing act for me.  I want them to do as much for themselves as they can, but I don&#39;t want them burdened with too much responsibility.  <br/>
    One more thought.  My life got a lot more peaceful when I mentally promoted myself to the rank of &quot;adult&quot; and demoted my parents and my in-laws to the rank of &quot;an adult friend.&quot;  I allow only as much comment/criticism/advice from them as I would accept from any other adult friend.   Any more than that and they are being controlling or abusive, and I start limiting my contact with them.    I don&#39;t know about your mother, but I doubt my mother would ever think of me as a competent adult.   I had to make that decision for myself--when I was 33!  <br/>

  Really?  I don&#39;t teach my children to blindly follow rules or to do what <br/>
  another adult says, ever. I want them to make their own decisions, even <br/>
  if it goes against rules.  Rules are often wrong, not reasonable, or <br/>
  downright against my moral beliefs.  My kids have learned about civil <br/>
  disobidience. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
  Yes, in that example of the no running rule, and similar ones.  For example, at our neighborhood park there is a sign that reads No Fishing, No Wading No Swimming at the pond. Actually it&#39;s just a big drainage basin, but it does have fish, ducks and frogs -- it also has a rough concrete finish, and the water is beyond skanky and filthy.  The rule exists for a good reason.  Besides, the entire time they are leaning over the edge looking for fish, I&#39;m truly very worried someone will fall in and be hurt.  I realize it&#39;s obssesive, but it&#39;s one of my genuine phobias, so in that case, I&#39;m glad I can cite the rule and herd them back towards the playground.  Maybe I should more closely examine my motives, and how I respond.<br/>
<br/>
     For that matter, it might be best if everyone just discounts much of what I say this weekend -- I&#39;ve just been thru an &#39;encounter&#39; with my Mom where she has AGAIN offered unsolicited advice for how I should be disciplining my children, the many mistakes I&#39;ve made with my oldest (and the current fall-out he&#39;s working thru) adn how I really need to look at my methods and make sure I prevent the same mistakes with the other two....  and I&#39;m a little defensive and scattered right now.   It&#39;s probably time for a personal rant into my journal.....<br/>

If anything, I&#39;ve been accused of &#39;over-explaining&#39; everything to my kids.... of letting them always have their own way...... of always caving in to them.....

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It would depend upon the child, the rules, the reasons, etc.<br/>
<br/>
But I don&#39;t have a bunch of rules in my house.  What rules would they <br/>
not follow?  The few rules I have are safety rules, designed to keep the <br/>
people (not the children) who are in my house safe.  If a person (not a <br/>
child, but a person of any age) decided to not follow rules that I <br/>
consider those of safety, then that&#39;s fine, that&#39;s their choice, but <br/>
then I would react to that.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, if a person, say--my sister in law--decided that she <br/>
didn&#39;t need to wear a seat belt in my car.  That&#39;s a rule I have, and <br/>
one that is not negotiable.  All children who need to be in a boster or <br/>
safety seat are in a safety seat.  All others need to wear a seat belt.  <br/>
If my sister in law doesn&#39;t want to wear a seat belt, that&#39;s OK.  But <br/>
then, she can&#39;t ride in my car.  I take a boy home from school about 3-4 <br/>
times a week.  He doesn&#39;t wear seat belts in his mother&#39;s car.  He does <br/>
in mine.  The one time he said he doesn&#39;t wear seat belts, I said great, <br/>
get out.  Good bye.  I told him that in my car everyone wears seat <br/>
belts, or they aren&#39;t in my car.  Period.  He made an informed <br/>
choice--to put his seat belt on (the alternative was to walk through a <br/>
horrible neighborhood at dusk, where gangs hang out.) <br/>
<br/>
But really, I&#39;ve never had an issue with the very few rules I have.  I <br/>
treat everyone, regardless of age, as though they are reasonable, <br/>
responsible humans who want to be safe and who generally act in a <br/>
reasonable way.  I take lots of children lots of places, and I&#39;ve rarely <br/>
had a child do things which are unsafe or might cause damage to property <br/>
or others.  The few times a behavior like that began, a conversation <br/>
would begin.  We would talk about the situation and why that action was <br/>
not acceptable, and because I treated the child as though they were <br/>
reasonable, they either saw the reason for not behaving in that way or <br/>
we found an alternative. <br/>
<br/>
There has been, more than once, a problem with adults.  Example--the <br/>
time an adult insisted on a girl scout field trip that her 8 year old <br/>
daughter needed to sit in the front seat in a car where there was an air <br/>
bag.  Girl Scout rules say that is not allowed, and the mother had a <br/>
tempertantrum.  I insisted the rule be followed, of they not attend the <br/>
trip.  It&#39;s a safety rule, I don&#39;t bend on safety rules.  In thinking, <br/>
it&#39;s always been adults who have tried to get away with breaking <br/>
rules... hmmm. <br/>

Exactly true of ramps with no-running signs and store shelves, though.<br/>

People don&#39;t have to encourage their children from following rules.<br/>

We have a high deck that&#39;s very dangerous for small children.  It&#39;s not <br/>
dangerous for big people.  Every time a family comes over with small children, I <br/>
show them the deck but I point out that there are places for kids to fall out, <br/>
and even on the stairs going down, the handrail is HIGH and kids could fall out <br/>
on all sides.   So I say I don&#39;t mind them going up or down, but they should <br/>
have a bigger person hold their hand.  Holly&#39;s helped lots of little kids up <br/>
and down it.<br/>

If it were her car and she was driving and it was her child, I don&#39;t think <br/>

<br/>
About two weeks ago our sweet little wonder-child (3 & 1/2 year-old-<br/>

Screaming until nearly throwing up. What she is screaming about just <br/>
kind of morphs for half and hour or more. MY EARS ARE ITCHY! I WANT <br/>
IT TO BE DAYTIME. I&#39;M SO TIRED. I DON&quot;T LIKE YOU. I NEED A DRINK. <br/>
WHERE&#39;S MY TOY...<br/>
<br/>
We aren&#39;t sure what&#39;s the best way to handle it. I just sit with her <br/>
and try to talk to her quietly. &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Usually a drink or <br/>
food interrupts the screaming enough the she calms down, but it takes <br/>
a good long time to calm her down enough that she will take a drink, <br/>
but I don&#39;t want her thinking food is the answer.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When kids are generally respected and treated thoughtfully, they <br/>
usually see the sense to a request. On this list, that goes without <br/>
saying, I think. So Sandra can, typically, say, &quot;Marty, that&#39;s loud,&quot; <br/>
(she doesn&#39;t even have to make a request - just gently bring his <br/>
attention to it) and Marty would immediately become cognizant of his <br/>
surroundings, recognize what other people were trying to do there, <br/>
understand that his loudness was impinging on their ability to do it, <br/>
and he would CARE enough to inconvenience himself.<br/>
<br/>
However, sometimes a child may not see the sense in a request. The <br/>
assumption that a child is rational is generally true, imo, but that <br/>
rationality is constrained by their knowledge and their ability to <br/>
predict consequences AND their ability to be empathetic.  Although <br/>
discussing it helps them along in that development, they may simply not <br/>
have enough background knowledge, they may confuse what they hope would <br/>
be the consequences with the actual possible consequences and they <br/>
simply may not care.<br/>
<br/>
I tend to give information first - without any request or command. <br/>
&quot;There is a sign posted here that says no running.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I said to my husband when he started to park the car last <br/>
night, &quot;There is a sign there that says no parking.&quot; I didn&#39;t just <br/>
shout, abruptly, &quot;Don&#39;t park there.&quot; Good thing, too, because in the <br/>
small print, that I couldn&#39;t read, it said, &quot;Except Sundays.&quot; &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Generally there is a reason for a sign that says, &quot;No running.&quot; I mean, <br/>
there was some reason why someone decided to put it there. At the <br/>
college where I teach there are roads that go right up to between <br/>
buildings, but there are rules about driving past a certain point.  <br/>
I&#39;ve heard people gripe about that - because they&#39;d like to drive up <br/>
closer to the buildings. But any closer to the buildings and there are <br/>
students who tend to wander around with their heads in their books (or <br/>
in the clouds). I know that I would be very careful and would not run <br/>
any of them down so the rule doesn&#39;t make sense for me. But I was THERE <br/>
when a student was run over and killed and I&#39;m glad the rule is imposed <br/>
on people - including, maybe especially including, those who don&#39;t <br/>
understand it or agree with it.<br/>
<br/>
Generally I follow rules. I think the default ought to be to follow <br/>
them unless there is a good reason not to do so. To have a default of, <br/>
&quot;Break the rule unless I understand it and it makes sense for me,&quot; <br/>
could be dangerous - there could so easily be times when I don&#39;t <br/>
understand the reason for it, even when there is a very very good <br/>
reason. As much as I want my kids to question authority and be WILLING <br/>
to break rules, I don&#39;t want them to think that breaking rules should <br/>
be done just because they feel like it at that moment.<br/>
