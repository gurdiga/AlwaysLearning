<div id="ygrps-yiv-1088939938">&lt;br/&gt;Hi,&lt;br/&gt;This is my first post.  I have been reading a lot and trying a little.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We moved our family to Ecuador a little over a year ago and after about three months of homeschooling on my own and failing we have started to unschool in earnest.  In the deschooling phase right now.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In September my two children, both age 9, and I will go back to Ohio for our first visit.  I am terrible at answering on the spot questions so I want to prepare myself and be armed with appropriate responses to the question, &quot;So, what are they learning?&quot;  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Right now they spend just about every waking minute on the computer playing Animal Jam or making videos with their LPS and Legos, and listening to music.  So, I know what they are interested in but.... how can I turn that into a pat answer that will satisfy family members so that I won&#39;t feel defensive or hounded by the questions and can move away from the topic as quickly as possible.<br/>
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks for your answers in advance,&lt;br/&gt;Sherry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sent from Yahoo! Mail for iPad<br/>

I found it helps to tell tell cute stories, or describe something one of my kids loves to do - kind of sidestepping the actual question and getting at what I see as the root of the question which is a chance for someone to connect with me and/or my kids. If you have a hard time remembering cute stories, it might help to write them down - keep a journal or a blog, or even write notes on something like facebook... but I&#39;d think a journal or blog would be better in some ways as it&#39;s more durable and you may want those cute stories again later, when the kids are grown ;)<br/>

I might say something like &quot;oh they&#39;re So Creative! They&#39;ve been making their own videos and learning all about storytelling, film production, animation - why, just the other day...&quot; and then tell a particular story about something they discovered or found out. Don&#39;t make it a report, make it a story people want to hear, that lets them smile and think happy thoughts about you and your family. <br/>
