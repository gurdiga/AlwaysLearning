<div id="ygrps-yiv-2111510171">To me, in the Mid-West (IL & MO), a torpedo is the bomb / projectile the submarine shoots at others to sink them - it travels underwater - skimming the surface too.  The Submarine is the &quot;boat/ship&quot; that goes underwater.<br/>
<br/>
A hoagie is a sandwich - we don&#39;t call it that, I just know that ;)  Every one around here calls it a sub sandwich.<br/>
<br/>
Oh and a grinder is a machine used to grind things - we have one our son has been using to help make wooden swords.<br/>
<br/>
I never realized others call the &quot;underwater ship&quot; a hoagie, grinder or torpedo.<br/>

GRINDERS&quot;&gt; I knew I had heard of a grinder before. I knew I should <br/>
know that it was.<br/>
<br/>
I my unschooling fashion I kept asking people and eventually looked <br/>
it up. Then announced to everyone whom I had asked what a grinder <br/>
was. LOL<br/>
<br/>
I grew up in California where it was a sub. and in Montana it is a <br/>
sub or a hoagie. <br/>
<br/>
I am uncertain if the name grinder is really very attractive for such <br/>
a delicious sandwich.<br/>
<br/>
Happy THANKSGIVING!<br/>

I know grinder is used in Boston. And hoagie in Pittsburgh. Not sure<br/>
where the others are used.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sub, in New Mexico, but sometimes they&#39;re just &quot;sandwiches,&quot; as  <br/>
they&#39;re hugely more common now (outside of homes) than anything on  <br/>
small, square bread.   And sometimes in homes as well, they&#39;re made.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Native locals would understand Hero sandwich and Hoagie, but probably  <br/>
not torpedo or grinder.<br/>
<br/>
Hoagie sounds nasty, though, and it&#39;s not used of food much that I&#39;ve  <br/>
ever heard except on TV.   It sounds like hoik and stogie.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s nice that someone has printed multi-dialectal sandwich  <br/>
wrappers, though! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2076789488">These days, in Southern California, I don&#39;t think people younger than  <br/>
40 or so use the word &quot;subs.&quot; There are still some little independent  <br/>
&quot;Submarine Sandwiches&quot; shops around, but when the teens/young adults  <br/>
want to go eat, they don&#39;t say, &quot;Let&#39;s go get subs.&quot; They do say,  <br/>
&quot;Let&#39;s go get sandwiches.&quot; Even when going to Subway, they&#39;ll refer  <br/>
to &quot;Subway Sandwiches,&quot; and don&#39;t call them &quot;subs&quot; or &quot;submarine  <br/>
sandwiches.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Quizno&#39;s calls their sandwiches &quot;Subs&quot; - I think they call them that  <br/>
everywhere, including Boston! &lt;G&gt; But I remember not too long ago one  <br/>
of the teenage kids with me asking, &quot;Why do they call them subs?&quot;<br/>

I would recognize that if someone asked me if I wanted to, from my  <br/>
mom (a Texan) using that term.<br/>
My kids wouldn&#39;t know, I don&#39;t think.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s for height, not length.<br/>
<br/>
In the Blondie comics, her husband Dagwood used to make huge, tall  <br/>
sandwiches he rarely got to eat because  he&#39;d be called away.<br/>

a long roll like a sub, but it&#39;s included in the &quot;Hoagies, etc&quot; list.<br/>
