<div id="ygrps-yiv-89730912">I am wondering if there is a book in print (rather than e-book) about the experience of unschooling a child who schools would label &quot;special needs?&quot;  It would be for a gift for a friend who is moving.  I&#39;ll be getting a copy of Sandra&#39;s book for her family but just thought I&#39;d see if there was another something out there too.  Many thanks!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-149939737">There are some pages on my site, but I rarely mention it, because unschooling works the same way with all children.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know of a book, and if I did, I probably would hesitate to recommend having anyone think that there&#39;s one way of unschooling some children, and another for others.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree.  It&#39;s more about trying to meet my friend where she is (which is thinking that her child is so &quot;different&quot;) and that maybe if she read about someone with a similar situation who was choosing to unschool it might create some space for her to consider it someday. As it is, she is choosing to move her son to a third school in three years, including changing houses/towns, while chasing what I think is a chimera of special resources to keep him &quot;on track&quot; with his peers.  And he&#39;s only six. I casually mentioned the idea that children learn to read on their own, sometimes at six sometimes at twelve and it was pretty shocking to her to think about that. I have read so many of the heartfelt regrets posted on your website from parents who came to unschooling later rather than sooner, that I suppose I wish I could spare her and, more importantly, her lovely son, the upheaval, anxiety and sense of failure they are experiencing. But, of course, that is my agenda, not hers!</div>

 </span></blockquote>What are you hoping to convey? That unschooling is for everyone? Or that there are other options for a high needs/ special needs child besides the usual? <br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s the latter, you might do just as well giving her something like &quot;Parenting and Explosive Child&quot; or &quot;The Out of Sync Child&quot; - neither are unschooling books, but they&#39;re books I&#39;ve recommended to unschoolers as well as other parents struggling to find ways to help their kids. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1065685707">Maybe Pam Laricchia&#39;s first book would help her, then.  It&#39;s short enough she might read it and if the ideas are percolating through her, it will change the way she sees his experiences in school.  It won&#39;t be &quot;special needs&quot; but it could be the thing she needs to see things she can&#39;t see now.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Lenore Colacion Hayes has a book called: Homeschooling the Child with ADD<br/>
(or Other Special Needs): Your Complete Guide to Successfully Homeschooling<br/>
the Child with Learning Differences.  It isn&#39;t really about ADD in<br/>
particular and is more about unschooling than homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be good for the purpose of moving someone toward<br/>
unschooling a kid who is now in school and identified as having special<br/>
needs. Most of the book makes the case for exactly that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Both ideas, actually!  Thank you for helping me clarify that.<br/>
<br/>
Meredith, Pam and Sandra, I am going to take your book suggestions, read them myself and then pass along some or all to my friend.  Looks like a good summer reading list and one that will undoubtedly benefit my family&#39;s unschooling life.</div>
