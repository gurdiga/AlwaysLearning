An article I had written for a newsletter used to be linked to their site, <br/>
but that site seems to have disappeared, so I&#39;ve put it up on a new page of <br/>
its own.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s an old article.  If you&#39;ve read The Homeschool Book of Answers you&#39;ve <br/>
already seen it.<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s not about unschooling, it&#39;s about child-led learning.  So if anyone <br/>
wants to discuss the difference after they read this, I&#39;m game!<br/>

confrontation with the public school authorities?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sure, I&#39;d enjoy it. My oldest attends a one day a week gate program through<br/>
our school district. She has one more year in the program. I think it is a<br/>
positive experience for her, but, when I think of sending my never really been<br/>
to school youngest daughter there, I think, &quot;I don&#39;t think so.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1903511302">Dear Sandra Dodd:  I have been reading this egroup for a couple of<br/>
months but have remained quiet.  I liked this article because it relates<br/>
to my own situation.  We put our oldest son in school after a difficult<br/>
move and moving to a town where there is no network of homeschoolers.<br/>
He decided to go to school to meet the neighborhood kids and do it on<br/>
his own.  He went to school for half of first grade and than completed<br/>
his 2nd grade and does not want to go back.  I would keep on encouraging<br/>
him to explore his own interests, but I noticed when in school, he did<br/>
not have the energy or the brain power to explore what he really likes.<br/>
At the end of this school year, I was casual about Homeschooling and did<br/>
not cram it down his throat.  I just said try to envision what you would<br/>
like with your schooling in the fall.  Within 4 weeks of deprogramming<br/>
he wants to homeschool although he doesn&#39;t like the name so we thought<br/>
up his own name - NATE Natural Achievement Through Education.  I feel<br/>
confidence which I lacked when I was Homeschooling before and it showed<br/>
and he sensed it.  Now he understands the difference.  A couple of<br/>
months ago it was a discussion in this group about a kid who decided to<br/>
go to school or not.  It depends on the kid and the parenting.  I have a<br/>
daughter who has no desire to go to school and hopefully we will be more<br/>
established in a network for our whole family.  But we will cross that<br/>
bridge when it comes.  My name is Lisa.  I am sorry I didn&#39;t introduce<br/>
myself before but I learned a lot just by reading and listening.  Peace<br/>
to you.  Lisa, another Montanan <br/>

<br/>
I forgot to get back to that topic.<br/>
It had to do with the article about my sister&#39;s kids staying home or going to <br/>
school as they chose for many years.  <br/>
<br/>
Her oldest is college age now.  <br/>
<br/>
But I had said I thought it wasn&#39;t about unschooling but it was about <br/>
child-led learning.<br/>
<br/>
I think someone did want to talk about that and we didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t personally call unschooling &quot;child-led learning,&quot; although I probably <br/>
have a time or two years ago.  Some people use that as their quicky <br/>
description, I&#39;m pretty sure (or did years ago). <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s probably why some people say if a child chooses it, it&#39;s <br/>
unschooling--even if what the child chooses is a curriculum or boarding <br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
I think of unschooling as learning from a life without schoolishness.  But <br/>
I&#39;ve kinda made a full-time project of it.  Other families want to make a <br/>
school-replacement temporary thing of it, and so for them it&#39;s going to less <br/>
life-transforming.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1367196845">I would support Dylan if he wanted to go to public school.  I can say<br/>
that pretty confidently because he really seems like the last kid who<br/>
would ever want to.<br/>
But if he did, I wouldn&#39;t call it unschooling.  <br/>
I&#39;d be too depressed to call it anything. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In my little local news paper last Wednesday I saw and ad &quot;lawn mowing by<br/>
honor student&quot; and it made me feel a little sad.  I thought about honor<br/>
students I knew, (I wasn&#39;t one of them) and about that moment when they<br/>
realized &quot;honor student&quot; didn&#39;t mean anything to anyone in the real<br/>
world.  <br/>
<br/>
My good and kind friend Jeff just took the Praxis tests ( is that right?)<br/>
and jumped through all the hoops to become a non traditional teacher in<br/>
the Arkansas public school system.<br/>
He just quit a good paying job and changed his life and at forty two is<br/>
going to start his first day as a science teacher on August 19.   <br/>
I feel like throwing a shoe at him, but I also want to be hopeful for<br/>
him.  He said he&#39;ll remember the kids are there because they have to be<br/>
and he is there by choice.  Maybe that means something good. <br/>

I have no idea where I was going with this...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1628054038">I was really bummed when Nate went to school and actually liked it the<br/>
last half of 1st grade.  What was disturbing was Nate, who is very<br/>
gifted at figuring things out, was not ready to read.  I saw his self<br/>
esteem shrink.  I just encouraged him in all activities he was<br/>
interested.  In second grade he loathed it but I said as a family we are<br/>
committed to summer.  They put so much pressure on kids to do reading it<br/>
is serious.  There are some good educators in public schools who really<br/>
give, than there are the control freaks who pull rank on everyone<br/>
including  parents.  Unfortunately most are control freaks.  And that<br/>
what happens to kids they loose more and more of control of their lives.<br/>
Schools are taking over so much of the parenting and family roles, but<br/>
it is the society who lets it happen to.  The school reflect capitalism<br/>
and the set up kids who will be successful and who will not, like our<br/>
society.  I got to go.  Peace Lisa<br/>
