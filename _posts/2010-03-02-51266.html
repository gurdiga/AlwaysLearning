<div id="ygrps-yiv-94689640">I think part of it is that making change and school math subtraction <br/>
shouldn&#39;t necessarily be the same process, and if the kids are thinking that <br/>
they have to do a subtraction sum, instead of counting upwards they will get <br/>
anxious.<br/>
<br/>
You know what I mean by counting upwards - from the cost to the amount <br/>
paid - &quot;2.46, 2.50, 3, 4, 5 dollars&quot; into the hand instead of  &quot;2.46 from <br/>
5.00 is ..um .er 3.54 no, no 2.54 (phew)&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-192709477">It&#39;s funny (not really) I always thought I was bad at math.  Something happens to my brain and I just can&#39;t &quot;see&quot; what to do as I can with other things.  It&#39;s a real &quot;white out&quot; in my head (hard to explain, but that&#39;s what it seems like).<br/>
<br/>
What I now know is that my reactions are entirely the result of school-induced math anxiety.  I see how my unschooled kids handle &quot;math&quot; and it is so easy and normal and - yikes - fun, that I have re-learned from them how to approach it.  Some of my anxiety is going away, slowly but surely.....  <br/>
<br/>
In a way I am lucky to have had my experiences, and therefore my perpective, because so many people stress out about their kids learning math, and I have no idea why they get excited about it.  I would never want to subject my kids to math the way I learned it (or didn&#39;t learn it as the case may be).  <br/>

My youngest son is absolutely brilliant in his approach to numbers.  He would have been discouraged early on in school, of that I have little doubt....<br/>

<br/>
Counting upwards was what was taught, though.  Maybe if they were first exposed to it in real life instead of in a math book, or maybe if they were older, or maybe if one of the moms wasn&#39;t standing over her daughter saying, &quot;OK, he gave you $5 and the box of cookies costs $3.50, so how much change does he get?&quot; or maybe if people who were buying cookies didn&#39;t keep saying, &quot;This is good math practice for you&quot;, they could have relaxed and figured it out.  Or maybe not, maybe later.  The thing is, before unschooling I wouldn&#39;t have noticed all this.  I might have just been caught up in it myself.  Now I feel like I&#39;m able to see things that most of those around me still can&#39;t--I can see the matrix! ;-) Anyway, I don&#39;t know if I would have had the courage to take my daughter out of school when she seemed to be doing fine, for the most part, if it weren&#39;t for those, especially with grown and older kids, who have shared their experiences and wisdom.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-511176301">I have experienced that type of &#39;white out&#39;.  I would just go blank.  I was terrible at math.  I developed such a fear of it and the teachers that walking into class could make me feel sick.  I was clueless and confused and everything went too fast for me.  By the time I was finished with high school my inability to do math was such a part of my identity that I avoided whole career choices because of it.  I had &#39;anti&#39; math.  I eventually went back to school as an adult for a programming degree because I had experience with computers and coding and wanted the degree (I&#39;m 42 now, that degree is not as important as it was then).   There were math requirements, and I had to start at the very beginning (no credit remedial courses).  It was slow for me, but I filled the requirements.   I absolutely believe when you are ready to learn something and need to, that is when its possible.  I still have math anxiety, my mind goes blank when I&#39;m put on the spot.  I do not consider myself good at the math in those classes I took because I have no retention.  They were more like hoops to jump through to get the degree than actually useful to what I do.  My sons (14 & 10) who have never had a math class approach math naturally and fearlessly, without anxiety and white outs.  Its a useful and fun tool for them to use, not a mountain to climb and conquer :)  ~Isabelle<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-870884097">-=-It&#39;s funny (not really) I always thought I was bad at math.  <br/>
Something happens to my brain and I just can&#39;t &quot;see&quot; what to do as I  <br/>
can with other things. It&#39;s a real &quot;white out&quot; in my head (hard to  <br/>
explain, but that&#39;s what it seems like).-=-<br/>
<br/>
I did really well at school math until Algebra II came along when I  <br/>
was fifteen.  But still I have a &quot;white out,&quot; and I think it might be  <br/>
the same way some people have no way to know whether a word is spelled  <br/>
correctly or not.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t visualize or remember numbers.  I&#39;ve described it as not  <br/>
having a storage place for numbers.  When I do remember a number, it  <br/>
has to do with the sound of it or a pattern I can visualize.  I can&#39;t  <br/>
visualize the numerals themselves for long enough for it to do any good.<br/>
<br/>
I saw a sign yesterday that said this, centered, artfully arranged on  <br/>
a big sign:<br/>
<br/>
Village Inn<br/>
vi<br/>
<br/>
I said &quot;Why is that &quot;Village Inn 6&#39;?&quot;  No, the village inn corporation  <br/>
seems to be adopting a logo that is vi.  Lower case.  That TOTALLY  <br/>
means &quot;six.&quot;  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
On top of my inability to remember a number (it took me a long time to  <br/>
memorize my social security number, and I still don&#39;t know my bank  <br/>
account number, so I carry it around with me, in my pocket).... I had  <br/>
school math trauma.  But the school-crazy didn&#39;t cause my inability to  <br/>
remember.  I used to have to write my locker combination down.  I  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t forget it during the week, but if there was a break from  <br/>
school for a week or so, I wouldn&#39;t know it.  Writing it on notebooks  <br/>
didn&#39;t work.  I tried that.  So I used to write it very small  <br/>
somewhere in the hallway.  One year on a place on the wall I knew they  <br/>
would paint before long--I wouldn&#39;t have done it on a new paint job.   <br/>
One year on the end of a row of metal lockers.   Not my row. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My son, probably like many others left to find their own way with math, has developed his own formulas for things.  And he&#39;s right.  But at first I was worried that he wasn&#39;t &quot;learning&quot; the &quot;right way&quot; to do it.  LOL (a long time ago, now!)  He most certainly would have been discouraged, and then might have had the big &quot;white out&quot; around numbers too!<br/>

Isn&#39;t it ironic?<br/>
<br/>
Right in front of them in the real world, and people are still valuing math <br/>
&quot;practice&quot; and school math over real life.<br/>
<br/>
Doing the practical exercises to facilitate understanding the theory, <br/>
instead of learning some theory to facilitate the practical application.<br/>
