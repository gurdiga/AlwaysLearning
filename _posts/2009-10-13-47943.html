<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; i have been reading about dyslexia - and it sounds exactly like                  <br/>

 &gt; help earlier! and am questioning the whole unschooling thing!                    <br/>
                                                                                    <br/>
 </span></blockquote> I understand you feel frustrated, but I don&#39;t think labeling him is a good idea.   <br/>
 If a child isn&#39;t developmentally ready to read, no amount of verbal pushing,       <br/>
 worksheets, textbooks, or simple readers are going to change that. Surely that     <br/>
 causes frustration on both sides. That is why some kids have learning disability   <br/>
 labels. I think teachers are offended when a child doesn&#39;t learn under their       <br/>
 instruction, especially with all the &quot;help&quot; used. I have never understood that     <br/>
 belief because I had college classes in early childhood education that focused on  <br/>
 learning about developmental skills. Those skills just cannot be hurried anymore   <br/>
 than someone can make a child walk or talk earlier.                                <br/>
                                                                                    <br/>
 I think others are offering great advice. I have one question though. Did your son <br/>
 decide he was ready to read, or have you or someone else nudged him because of his <br/>
 age?                                                                               <br/>
                                                                                    <br/>

                                                                                    <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-917583062">-=-well probably a bit of both - he realizes that his friends and  <br/>
other kids that<br/>
he knows that are his age and younger are reading -=-<br/>
<br/>
It would help kids to know that some others their age are not reading,  <br/>
or that some kids who say they are reading aren&#39;t really.   Especially  <br/>
school kids, who might get &quot;straight A&#39;s in reading&quot; and not be able  <br/>
to read anything but their reading books or other &quot;graded&quot; materials  <br/>
(things written specifically for them to be able to read with their  <br/>
limited skills).<br/>
<br/>
I think the biggest problem with lots of people is the idea that their  <br/>
situation is unique, that they&#39;re the last one, that they&#39;re the only  <br/>
one, that they&#39;re behind, deficient...<br/>
<br/>
With my kids when they came and said &quot;Jesse can do [something] and I  <br/>
can&#39;t,&quot; I would say  something like &quot;Jimmy can too, but Jesse can&#39;t  <br/>
skate as well as you can, and Jimmy isn&#39;t as nice to his sister.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you focus on what they can do, and remember that learning can be  <br/>
done without reading, and that there are LOTS of things to do while  <br/>
he&#39;s getting to the point that all those words come to make sense,   <br/>
then you&#39;re helping him as a person (not as a reader or non-reader,  <br/>
because that&#39;s not an either/or, black-or-white thing either).<br/>
<br/>
I was worried with Holly, and I felt bad for her, and I knew she would  <br/>
read.  She wanted me to get the 100 Lessons book, and I stalled and  <br/>
finally bought a used copy.  I thought it was dreadful, but went  <br/>
through a couple of the pages with her.  She just wasn&#39;t ready, but I  <br/>
offered a few times to work with her, and both she and I moved more  <br/>
toward other interests and projects--art, her pet rats, clothes/ <br/>
fashion.  Dolls.<br/>
<br/>
When her reading did kick in it flooded in.  A friend of hers (kind of  <br/>
a bully friend) also had pet rats, and had a book about rats Holly  <br/>
wanted me to get her.  I did.  Holly could read then, and she read a  <br/>
section the other girl had &quot;read&quot; to her.  The other girl had been  <br/>
making stuff up.  The information she had given Holly, with that page  <br/>
open, was *not* what the book said.   Very illuminating for Holly.<br/>
