<div id="ygrps-yiv-614140240">Read more about the chats here.  They work best with a keyboard or good input.  The can move very quickly; some people don’t like that.<br/>
<br/>
But half an hour from the time I’m writing this, there will be a two-hour chat on uses of the media.  <br/>
<br/>
if you see this after it’s over (as most will), but you’re interested in chats, you can subscribe to nofitications (I forgot to send one this week, but I usually remember) at the blog, too.<br/>

The “When, Where and How?” tab has a link and a password.<br/>
