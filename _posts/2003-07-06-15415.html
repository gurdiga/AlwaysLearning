<div id="ygrps-yiv-1144717846">An experience I had with my oldest, Aislinn, has been making me think a <br/>
lot about how much value we as humans place on facts versus how powerful <br/>
mystery, magic, and myth are and how, outside, of religions, our world <br/>
has less of the unknown in it every day.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what happened:  The girls were watching an episode of Zoom on <br/>
Nickelodeon (a pre-teen show where they show games, experiments, and <br/>
projects).  They came to find me, all excited, to show me this:  stand <br/>
facing a wall so that one outstretched hand can just touch the wall by <br/>
the tips of your fingers.  Touch the wall.  Now bend that same arm quite <br/>
hard and rub your elbow with the other hand.  Now try to touch the wall <br/>
again with the original arm.  Your arm won&#39;t reach.  <br/>
<br/>
So the girls and I thought this was amazing and wierd and we ran all <br/>
over the house doing it over and over.  We called the grandparents and <br/>
all our friends to have them do it.  It was fun and strange. I was <br/>
wondering why this happened and thought a lot about it.  As usual, I was <br/>
talking about the hows and whys to the girls.  I finally decided that it <br/>
must happen because when the arm is bent, the muscle contracts and <br/>
doesn&#39;t completely stretch out right away, thus making the arm appear <br/>
magically shorter.  Makes sense to me.  The whole elbow rubbing thing is <br/>
just for drama, like a magicians waving wand.<br/>
<br/>
Then Aislinn burst into tears and was furious with me for ruining the <br/>
fun.  Since I had figured it out, the magic of it was gone.  And I felt <br/>
SO bad.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s made me think a lot about facts people have figured out over <br/>
time and what those facts have ultimately done to us and whether we&#39;ve <br/>
become better for all the knowing.  An example: Before people new how <br/>
babies were made, babies were a gift, a miracle (of course their <br/>
survival rate was much lower, so that added to their value as well).  I <br/>
wonder what that must have been like to have a baby and look on it as  a <br/>
pure blessing unto me.  Not that I don&#39;t feel that way about my girls, <br/>
but not knowing all the hows and whys of it all, how would I have felt? <br/>
 And what other things that we do every day have lost their magic, their <br/>
mystery to become commenplace?  The sun rising, the moon, rainbows.  <br/>
<br/>
Personally, I am glad to know so much especially about medical things. <br/>
 But I feel sad that our world feels the need to find all the answers. <br/>
 Even religions are based on finding the answers to questions like where <br/>
did we come from and where do we go when we die.  For myself, I don&#39;t <br/>
want to know these things.  I don&#39;t need to.  What matters is now and <br/>
here.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about and thought I&#39;d share <br/>
it with you, especially since my faux pas with the e-mail about the baby <br/>
holding the doctor&#39;s hand.  I never even picked up on the religious <br/>
aspect or the pro-life part.  I just thought it sounded beautifully <br/>
magical.  In retrospect, I can easily see it was ridiculous.  So it goes...<br/>

Have a great day everybody.</div>

&lt;&lt; Personally, I am glad to know so much especially about medical things. <br/>

<br/>
I think people are hardwired to be that way.<br/>
Even the myths and religions are ways to make working theories and test them <br/>
out.<br/>
Even where babies come from (all the former theories and conjurations) and <br/>
rainbows are given &quot;reasons&quot; and purposes.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Even religions are based on finding the answers to questions like where <br/>
did we come from and where do we go when we die.  For myself, I don&#39;t <br/>
want to know these things.  I don&#39;t need to.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve often said &quot;I don&#39;t care what happens when I die,&quot; and I mean it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
I do think it&#39;s one of the saddest things ever that people will live lives of <br/>
deprivation and pain because someone told them about heaven and hell and <br/>
scared them in a deep dark place that they would never see their mothers again if <br/>
they wore short sleeves and cut their hair and left their abusive husbands.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I never even picked up on the religious <br/>
aspect or the pro-life part.  I just thought it sounded beautifully <br/>
magical. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It seems to be another human trait, to identify magic and then try to use it <br/>
as a political weapon.<br/>
<br/>
Raiders of the Lost Ark, with the Nazis wanting the Ark of the Covenant, is <br/>
said to be true.  That&#39;s not my area of interest, Nazi &quot;magic,&quot; but is anyone <br/>
here into that topic?  Is that true (that its true)?<br/>
<br/>
The constant in-town land wars in Jerusalem are that way too, and that&#39;s been <br/>
going on over a thousand years.<br/>
