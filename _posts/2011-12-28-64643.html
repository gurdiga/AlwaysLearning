<div id="ygrps-yiv-146672124">I have a couple of things I want to say about the label, &quot;gifted,&quot; and then<br/>
something about Aspergers and the idea of labeling in general.<br/>
<br/>
I was a so-called gifted student, myself, growing up in the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s,<br/>
pulled out for special classes and activities, and then I was very involved<br/>
in gifted education in the 80&#39;s and early 90&#39;s with my own children. I<br/>
attended conferences, was a member of the California Association for the<br/>
Gifted, parent rep on our district&#39;s council for the gifted, and so on. I<br/>
lobbied Sacramento for more resources for the gifted. My older daughters<br/>
were in school for a while and both were in gifted programs. I know a whole<br/>
lot about the reasons for having gifted programs in school and how it has<br/>
developed and been carried out over the past decades.<br/>
<br/>
The official definition of &quot;gifted&quot; in the federal Elementary and Secondary<br/>
School Act is:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Students, children, or youth who give evidence of high achievement<br/>
capability in areas such as intellectual, creative, artistic, or leadership<br/>
capacity, or in specific academic fields, and who need services and<br/>
activities not ordinarily provided by the school in order to fully develop<br/>
those capabilities.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In other words, the very definition of &quot;gifted&quot; is that regular school is<br/>
not enough to support a child in developing to his/her full (exceptionally<br/>
high) individual potential. Outside of school, this definition really has<br/>
little practical meaning since every homeschooled child can supported to<br/>
work up to his/her own individual potential. As stated by the National<br/>
Association for Gifted Children:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;*Educating each person at a certain age in the same way is like giving<br/>
everyone the same size shoe: While a size 7 shoe may be wearable for a<br/>
short time by people who need a size 6 or 8, at some point the shoe just<br/>
doesn�t fit. Similarly, at some point, a standard education just doesn�t<br/>
fit certain children. In those cases, a label is often required so that<br/>
these students can receive an appropriate education.*&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Lip-service is paid to the idea that &quot;giftedness&quot; may be in areas other<br/>
than just intellectual (creative, artistic, leadership, or specific<br/>
academic fields). But, in my extensive experience, there is very very<br/>
seldom any identification method that goes beyond some sort of<br/>
testing/teacher recommendation based on intellect alone. Typically, schools<br/>
test about 10 percent of their students (based on teacher recommendations)<br/>
and from 2 to 8 percent (the actual percentage varies depending on the<br/>
available budget) are &quot;identified&quot; as gifted.<br/>
<br/>
For children who are especially poor fits in school, a &quot;gifted&quot; program of<br/>
some sort might make a huge difference in their experience. In the cases of<br/>
both of my older daughters, however, the gifted programs were actually MORE<br/>
boring and made them much more miserable than their regular classroom<br/>
experience.<br/>
<br/>
So we pulled them out. And, we quickly realized that the &quot;gifted&quot; label was<br/>
not only unhelpful, but potentially harmful, once we were no longer using<br/>
it to fight for a greater share of school resources.<br/>
<br/>
As homeschoolers/unschoolers, it no longer made any sense at all to compare<br/>
one child to another. And that is ALL that the label is - a comparison.<br/>
Again, from the National Association for the Gifted:<br/>
<br/>
*&quot;When we say that someone is gifted it compares their capacity to learn<br/>
and apply what they learn to that of their same-aged-peers.&quot;*<br/>
<br/>
As unschoolers, our children are not constrained to learn from a curriculum<br/>
that has been prepared to supposedly meet the needs of a typical child. So<br/>
this idea of children having differing &quot;capacities&quot; is irrelevant.<br/>
<br/>
The lists of characteristics of &quot;gifted&quot; children are lists of all kinds of<br/>
characteristics that humans may exhibit. Intense, inquisitive, emotional,<br/>
sensitive, empathetic, eclectic, focused..... Most parents reading those<br/>
lists will manage to find their own child described in some of the items in<br/>
the same ways people find themselves in the descriptions of their<br/>
astrological signs. Those with particularly intense kids will be especially<br/>
convinced.<br/>
<br/>
I think it can be comforting for those with what my grandmother (a teacher)<br/>
would have called &quot;high-strung&quot; kids, to read the descriptions and think of<br/>
them as the characteristics of being gifted. There is pride and a<br/>
&quot;not-my-fault&quot; relief.<br/>
<br/>
But there are risks - real ones - of labeling a child as gifted. The label<br/>
can often be used as an excuse for poor behavior. Parents can have a &quot;well,<br/>
she&#39;s gifted, what can we do,&quot; attitude. Very often, it means parents don&#39;t<br/>
look at the specifics of a problem, they just chalk it up to a child&#39;s<br/>
giftedness. That label can be a veil through which the parent sees the<br/>
child rather than seeing the child more directly and clearly. A parent<br/>
thinks, &quot;Oh look, intense emotional reaction - a symptom of her<br/>
giftedness,&quot; rather than really looking at why the child is having that<br/>
reaction.<br/>
<br/>
The label reduces the child...it discounts the real complex and totally<br/>
individual person he/she is.<br/>
<br/>
And, it can mislead - it says, &quot;Your child is gifted and gifted children<br/>
need......&quot; and you might be just sure that, being gifted, that must be<br/>
exactly what your child needs. But you could be wrong. Your child is so<br/>
much more than that list of characteristics - so much more an individual.<br/>
Again, the label can be a veil that comes between a parent and their fully<br/>
real individual child.<br/>
<br/>
There is so much difference between gifted children that lumping them<br/>
together does each a disservice.<br/>
<br/>
Which brings me to a quote from a very interesting article about Aspergers<br/>
Syndrome: *&quot;If you&#39;ve seen one Aspie, you&#39;ve seen one Aspie.&quot;  *<br/>
<br/>
The article is called: &quot;Aspergers theory does about-face,&quot; and says: &quot;People<br/>
with Asperger&#39;s syndrome, a high functioning form of autism, are often<br/>
stereotyped as distant loners or robotic geeks. But what if what looks like<br/>
coldness to the outside world is a response to being overwhelmed by emotion<br/>
� an excess of empathy, not a lack of it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In other words, the characteristic most indelibly associated with the<br/>
label, Apsergers, (lack of empathy) might be flat-out wrong. Wrong. And the<br/>
assumption may have led to all KINDS of inappropriate treatments of<br/>
children by teachers and parents who believed/assumed their child lacked<br/>
empathy because that&#39;s what the experts said.<br/>
<br/>
The article is here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.healthzone.ca/health/article/633688.">http://www.healthzone.ca/health/article/633688.</a><br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers can afford to ignore the labels and look directly at their own<br/>
individual real child. We can think for ourselves about what our child<br/>
needs from us. Letting go of labels is a really important part of the<br/>
process of learning to think for ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe those who still see value in the labels could try an experiment - try<br/>
to think, talk, respond, and interact with your child for a month without<br/>
using the label. Don&#39;t let it enter your head at all. If it does, your<br/>
month starts over! &lt;G&gt;  I think you might be surprised at how difficult it<br/>
is (if you&#39;ve been invested in the label for a while). Every time you think<br/>
&quot;gifted,&quot; stop and substitute a more specific term that describes your own<br/>
particular child. I think you&#39;ll find it a valuable exercise that will help<br/>
you understand your own child even better than you do and it will probably<br/>
bring you closer. I bet your child will notice it - even though he/she may<br/>
not know what is different.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-358132911">I have been following this whole thread with great interest.  My ten year old son sounds just like the OP&#39;s daughter around Christmas and birthdays, and dealing with his anticipation is challenging for sure. What I find most fascinating was that my son was labelled ADHD, ODD, and CAPD years ago but displays the characteristics that some have described in this thread for &#39;giftedness&#39;.  I felt the labels then, and now, are nonsense, but this just reaffirms that. It seems a child in school who doesn&#39;t want to pay attention sometimes, gets easily distracted, becomes disruptive, has intense emotions and obsessions - can be labelled at one end as having learning difficulties like &#39;ADHD&#39;, or &#39;gifted&#39; because they are bored and need more stimulation. <br/>
<br/>
If I had my time again I wouldn&#39;t have had him assessed as the labels have been unhelpful to us, and it took a long time for us to move past them.  We have now, but it has affected the way our extended family see him.  To them, we are unschooling because Jack has &#39;problems&#39; and can&#39;t &#39;cope&#39; with going to school.  There is a feeling that they feel sorry for him and us and they view our path as a necessity not a choice.  It&#39;s not true of course, and I don&#39;t like the fact they think this, but I can&#39;t change it.  I wonder if he had been labelled &#39;gifted&#39; instead what our parents reactions would have been - probably a lot of pride like Pam said. Go figure!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1376841603">Ha! I somehow made it from the special ed pullout program to the gifted pullout program in 3 years. Blessed that my parents didn&#39;t think of me any differently for it.<br/>
