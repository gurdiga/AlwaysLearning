<div id="ygrps-yiv-1705214405">&quot;There was quite a bit of telling children what to eat...&quot;--Pam<br/>
<br/>
This is probably the issue I struggle with the most, and I was wondering how far this or any other unschooling principle works with special needs kids.  Here&#39;s my story:<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I don&#39;t drink soda, so we never had it in the house.  The kiddos like it, so they would order it when we ate out at restaurants or at fast food joints.  I was OK with that.  Then my son (now 12) asked if we could buy it at the supermarket and have it in the house.  So we started buying a 2-liter bottle each week, the kiddos would have it when they wanted it (usually with dinner), and when we ran out they would have something else until we went shopping again.  Then ds asked if we could buy more soda so that we wouldn&#39;t run out during the week.  So we did.  Then kiddos started asking to drink soda during lunch, too.  OK.  Then it was several glasses of soda during meals for ds, plus more whenever he felt thirsty.  Nowadays soda is all he drinks (really), and that was too much for me.  Today he wanted a third glass during lunch, and I told him he might want to slow down because we were almost out.  He said we could go to the store and get more, and I said I didn&#39;t want to do that because I bought plenty of soda to get us through the week, and if we&#39;re running out, it means we&#39;re drinking too much soda.....<br/>
<br/>
Meltdown.<br/>
<br/>
I thought that if I didn&#39;t put restrictions on soda (or other food), ds would find some kind of balance with it.  It&#39;s working out that way with my neuro-typical daughter, but my son says he doesn&#39;t like water any more, and he&#39;s bored with orange juice.  I tried to talk to him about other drinks that would still be fun to drink, but have a little less sugar, or about drinking soda PLUS other things like water, milk, and juice.  He said he&#39;d rather die than have any limits put on him.  He says he doen&#39;t care about disease or obesity or health in general, and it&#39;s his body, and if he&#39;s OK with the consequences of drinking lots of soda, nobody else should worry about it.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually we agreed that we would do a week-long experiment:  He could have all the soda he wants, but he agrees to drink an equal amount of water.  I feel good that we came to this agreement and I didn&#39;t make any ultimatums or anything, but when you get right down to it, I&#39;m putting restrictions on him.  It made me wonder whether trusting our kids to know what&#39;s right for them is really applicable in all cases where the kid has Asperger Syndrome or depression or something like that.  My own conclusion is that parents can trust their kiddos to know what they need and make choices for themselves, but in SOME cases, for SOME issues, other mental or emotional issues get in the way of a kid knowing what&#39;s best for him.<br/>
<br/>
Just wondering what you all thought about that.<br/>

Until he gets enough (by his definition of &quot;enough&quot;) he can&#39;t actually  <br/>

the only one at our house who will drink more than one soda a day.   <br/>

I think you&#39;ve defined &quot;balance&quot; as doing what you want.<br/>
You&#39;ve also defined what you want, which is somewhere between no soda  <br/>

never have.  Others here might have.<br/>
What I have said is that if you let them make choices in little  <br/>
things, they&#39;ll have a great deal of experience by the time they get  <br/>

I&#39;ve said that if children are allowed freedom to eat what they feel  <br/>
they want or need, they seem to be better able to know what they need  <br/>

<br/>
If a label is to be invoked so that a mom can appeal to the people on  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A while back (maybe a year or more--I can&#39;t remember) we had a discussion about the word &quot;autonomy.&quot;  I think I brought it into the issue at hand, having understood that it was a central word to unschooling.  There were those who wanted to still use it, but when I really thought about what Sandra was saying about WHY she didn&#39;t like it with unschooling, it clicked my relationship with my children up to a whole new level.  <br/>
<br/>
At the risk of starting new controversy &lt;g&gt; I see the same underlying ideas at play in the statement &quot;kids know what&#39;s right for them.&quot;  I wonder where that notion came from, because I certainly held onto that for a long time myself, along with the autonomy concept.  Sometimes we know what&#39;s right for us, and sometimes we don&#39;t.  It seems a little like magical thinking to ascribe this special quality to children, that they always know  what&#39;s right for them.  It&#39;s a tall order for any person!<br/>
<br/>
There are choices, conversations, questions to be asked in a helpful, friendly, information-gathering sort of way (as opposed to a &quot;see, what you think doesn&#39;t make sense and what I think does&quot; sort of way!).  <br/>
<br/>
And there&#39;s looking out at the world together or there&#39;s seeing the other as adversary and ourselves as the limit makers.<br/>
<br/>
It seems like making a deal about drinking water MIGHT be fine, if your son is open to the idea, and is willing to experiment to see how he feels doing that, and if he&#39;s not in fear that the soda will disappear at the end of the week.  OR it will just increase his feeling that he&#39;s not able to have enough soda, thereby increasing his desire, anxiety and need for soda, making it look like he&#39;s &quot;addicted&quot; to soda.<br/>
<br/>
Just agreeing to do the experiment might not be good enough--if he&#39;s not agreeing because he&#39;s interested in exploring the idea of cutting down on soda, then it may be more detrimental than helpful.<br/>

Why not just get some huge cases of soda and lots of variety and let the kids play and explore?  You could even try making your own.<br/>
<br/>
You mentioned your son having Asperger&#39;s.  Without getting into the whole labeling thing here, kids with asperger&#39;s do tend to have interesting sensory input and it&#39;s very likely that he may like soda because of that reason alone, it sparkles and burns and the fizz feels good, especially with ice.  Why not indulge him in what he loves?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-139538340">We have a lot of soda. Linnaea really likes soda, has for a long time. We have a seltzer bottle thing and syrups so we can make our own soda, too, but those never seem to be as appealling to her as a Dr. Pepper or a Sprite. She doesn&#39;t like water and isn&#39;t that keen on juice, although she really likes the pink, Discovery apple juice a local apple juicer bottles in the autumn. Because of her preference for soda we keep bottles of soda in. We go through, at a guess--I&#39;m not keeping score, up to three 2-liter bottles a week unless there is a sleepover and then it goes up a bit. It&#39;s been a little less lately as there has been a focus on koolaid and apple juice. Because of her preference for soda we&#39;ve tried brewing ginger ale, it didn&#39;t work, and I really want to get a hold of root beer extract and brew root beer. I can&#39;t get it in the UK and the last time we were in the US I didn&#39;t get over to a brew shop as I got distracted by the conference we were<br/>
 attending. It&#39;ll happen, sometime. Oh, and Simon loves Mountain Dew and was really excited when we found it at an asian grocery in the &quot;big city&quot; near us, bottled in the Phillipines, with thicker plastic than the stuff we buy that&#39;s bottled in the UK. <br/>
<br/>
Linnaea likes other drinks as well. She likes lassi and she likes chai tea and she likes thai ice tea and a nice cuppa regular tea with milk and sugar. She likes to go into the tea shop and pick out different teas to brew up at home. Her world of fluids isn&#39;t just soda, but she does like soda. I&#39;m guessing she always will. It doesn&#39;t make her unhealthy, it doesn&#39;t make her less able to recover from illness, it doesn&#39;t make her more prone to highs and lows. She likes soda and she likes to have it regularly. <br/>
<br/>
I know a woman who gets upset about drinking coke. She really likes an ice cold coke, but she punishes herself everytime she has one. Coke tastes of guilt and calories that she doesn&#39;t want and obesity and diabetes to her. It isn&#39;t just the pleasure of carbonated syrupy water, it&#39;s all this baggage. Linnaea gets to have coke that is guilt-free. And so do I. I really prefer that. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1249715238">I have met families that makes their own soda.  I haven&#39;t tried it but it is<br/>
a fun project, especially if your son is really interested.  You may have a<br/>
different perspective on soda once you are done, too.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps he would like to immerse himself in soda, and go beyond drinking<br/>
it.  (No, I wasn&#39;t thinking a soda bath, lol).  He may be interested in<br/>
visiting a bottling plant or researching it online or drinking organic<br/>
soda.  My kids immerse themselves in dsi&#39;s and computers.  Other people have<br/>
called it an addiction, but I think they just don&#39;t want to see the<br/>
differences between heroin use, alcohol and playing a game on the computer<br/>
or drinking pop/eating candy.<br/>
<br/>
But to put pop in perspective a more historical perspective, people used to<br/>
drink beer in England and all over Europe and wine, too was considered<br/>
&quot;safer&quot; than drinking water.  Babies too weaned on bread dipped in beer,<br/>
because the water apparently was considered unsafe two hundred plus years<br/>
ago and bread was really hard.  Without fridges beer and wine also &quot;keep&quot;<br/>
very well.<br/>
<br/>
Safe drinking water is relatively new, though not in North America, yet we<br/>
are managing to pollute our waters, with things boiling doesn&#39;t kill, but<br/>
that&#39;s another story&lt;bwg&gt;.  Coffee and Tea are popular too, because boiling<br/>
water kills germs and so people who didn&#39;t drink &quot;alcohol&quot; were<br/>
teetotallers.  We live in a time of drinking eight glasses a day of<br/>
water and in our memories and those of our greatgrandparents water was fresh<br/>
from the well, especially in this hemisphere.  But, historically people were<br/>
drinking all sorts of things.<br/>
<br/>
My last thought is pop is called a &quot;soft drink&quot; cuz alcohol is the &quot;hard<br/>
drink&quot;.<br/>

I have let him make his choices, and now I&#39;m way past my comfort zone, I&#39;m worried, and I don&#39;t know what to do.  You have said before that you have made food suggestions to your kids.  In particular I remember you saying that you asked Holly to wait until after dinner to have a sweet snack she was about to eat.  You must have thought she wasn&#39;t making a good choice.  I was also suggesting to my son that he drink other things in addition to soda, and he got really upset.  Then I tried to explain why.  He didn&#39;t care.  I was under the impression that Holly acquiesced because in general she was not given food restrictions, so she was willing to do what you wanted in that case.  My son wasn&#39;t willing to do that.  His reaction was extreme for a 12-year-old, which is why I brought up his &quot;label&quot;.  Every parent, including you, who has advocated freedom for their kids to eat what they feel they need, has also tried to gently steer them in healthy directions by putting out fruits, for example, or asking them to eat something substantial (like dinner) before eating sweets.  That&#39;s the path I&#39;m trying to take, but it&#39;s hard right now.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1759463994">i also made my own pomegranate syrup this christmas, (really really easy), using juice and sugar and water and lemon, and then mixed some with sparkling water and my daughter said it was the best drink ever.  like an italian soda.  you could do that with any juice, to make it more soda like (my son doesn&#39;t like juice or most sparkling juice, although they sell a blueberry one at trader joes he loves).  but yes, i agree that it should be a fun and more interesting alternative, not a result of limitation.  my son loves soda.  but also has does self limit to some degree, out of his OWN developing understanding of how he feels/what  he sees as the results of consuming huge amounts of sugar at once.  he might have no soda for a week or two, then 1 a day for another week.  he almost never has more than that.  this is most definitely a kid who had an intense desire for large amounts of sugar, from toddlerhood - so it&#39;s really fascinating to watch that self-regulation.  he also is mostly happy with hansens soda, which uses sugar rather than HFCS, so i buy that, and when we are at the movies or somewhere that has regular soda, *if* he wants it, he orders it.  but this is the result of 2 years of true freedom and choice without judgement.  and it&#39;s *his* result.    <br/>
<br/>
i think the OP was the same one who said her son would rather *die* than be controlled?  that really struck a chord with me - my son is similar in that respect, and tends towards depression and anxiety as well.  in my opinion, kids with those tendencies need MORE freedom, more support in their yearning for freedom, and less control and judgement (not that anyone needs control or judgement) than do kids who tend toward easy going, whatever&#39;s fine, type attitude/experience.  i have seen that to be true even with kids with diagnoses.  i hope i am not confusing the original post with another.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1655700006">-=- I wonder where that notion came from, because I certainly held  <br/>
onto that for a long time myself, along with the autonomy concept.  <br/>
Sometimes we know what&#39;s right for us, and sometimes we don&#39;t. It  <br/>
seems a little like magical thinking to ascribe this special quality  <br/>
to children, that they always know what&#39;s right for them. It&#39;s a tall  <br/>
order for any person!-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think some people would like to believe that it&#39;s easy to describe  <br/>
unschooling, so they find a pretty, soothing explanation and they  <br/>
sprinkle it around like fairy dust.  They don&#39;t stick around to see  <br/>
whether it actually worked or not.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been sticking around now for 18 years, helping other people  <br/>
actually work it out, and observing those families who were  <br/>
unschooling before I ever considered it (Rice McClures and Odhners;  <br/>
I&#39;m in contact with the mom of one family and the mom and the kids of  <br/>
another).<br/>
If I give bad advice, or if I allow bad advice to stand on a list or  <br/>
discussion I&#39;m running, I try to amend the misinformation.<br/>
<br/>
The pretty descriptions come from two angles, I think.  Maybe three.   <br/>
One is that women tend toward soothing noise rather than concrete (and  <br/>
possibly uncomfortable) information.  Another is that school didn&#39;t  <br/>
always teach us what they meant to, but they DID train us like rats to  <br/>
do the very least possible work to get that pellet of alfalfa.<br/>
<br/>
Some people see me, or other list owners or speakers or whatever,  <br/>
getting attention or being invited places, and they think all they  <br/>
have to do is create a yahoogroup, or run a list, and if it&#39;s an anti- <br/>
Sandra list, certainly they have an influx of other members, and they  <br/>
*think* all they have to do is make some unschooling noise and they  <br/>
will be just as good and respected as anyone who ever helped anybody,  <br/>
but it turns out that bad advice makes families unhappy, and I&#39;m  <br/>
continuing to try to gather ideas and people for the purpose of making  <br/>
families happy, and making unschooling sensible and long-lasting.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not magic, it&#39;s work.  It&#39;s not easy to understand, it&#39;s  <br/>
difficult.  But once it&#39;s understood, once a person really is  <br/>
facilitating learning at home and kids are relaxing into trusting that  <br/>
the parents will help them and trust them and not whip the rug out  <br/>
from under them in the middle of a game or a work-in-progress, they  <br/>
start to blossom.  When the kids start to blossom the parents feel  <br/>
successful and their fear diminishes.  When the parents feel great  <br/>
about being good parents, and the kids are blossoming, then it can be  <br/>
self-fueling.  Until a family gets to that point, they might be  <br/>
confused and frustrated.<br/>
<br/>
If someone has started a list who doesn&#39;t know the next several steps,  <br/>
that might just be a source of new and frustrated people to join this  <br/>
list (if they&#39;re lucky) or to give up and put their kids in school  <br/>
where the school doesn&#39;t think very highly of homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;m rambling and so I&#39;ll stop, but I&#39;m rambling in the area of  <br/>
something we don&#39;t talk about much, but it&#39;s there and it&#39;s big.<br/>

beer. I can&#39;t get it in the UK -=-<br/>
<br/>
Schuyler, we drank root beer floats in your family&#39;s honor, on  <br/>
Thursday night at the Santa Fe Unschooling Symposium.  I forgot to  <br/>
take a photo.  I didn&#39;t take enough photos.   But several moms built  <br/>
the floats all on one table, and as the take-out food from Blake&#39;s  <br/>
Lotaburger and Dion&#39;s Pizza was being distributed, we passed out those  <br/>
root beer floats.  Made with A&W from 2 liter bottles that had cost  <br/>
from 89 cents to $1.19, depending when and where they&#39;d been bought.    <br/>
I should&#39;ve told you sooner.<br/>
<br/>
There was also a waffle breakfast, and the waffle irons will be  <br/>
delivered to you at some point.  Not as early as they would have been  <br/>
if Julie Daniel had made it over.  Snow kept her home, or the waffle  <br/>
irons would be in the U.K. now.  We had a plan.<br/>
<br/>
Joy is more important than control.  If a person finds joy in control,  <br/>
that happiness is at the expense of other people&#39;s freedom.<br/>
<br/>
Children might choose an all-organic, vegan diet someday.  It would  <br/>
limit them socially, but they could make that choice on their own.    <br/>
If they don&#39;t have choices all along, the choices they make on their  <br/>
own later will be reactionary rather than balanced and thoughtful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-704540697">I&#39;ve known kids that gag on water but can drink plenty of things.<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
I was one of those kids. I can taste water and about 99% of the water tastes gross. Even bottled water. <br/>
There is 1 bottle water in this country that I like and they don&#39;;t sell it where I live. <br/>
I finally fount one carbonated/sparkling water I like and is not so expensive.<br/>
That is what I drink/<br/>
It also need to be at the right temperature.<br/>
I do understand what it is to not like drinking water.<br/>
Now my kids can dring whatever they want.<br/>
We have a cooler with water, milk, chocolate milk, juice and at least 2 types of soda the kids like, plus my sparkling water.<br/>
Right now my son likes juice, water and chocolate milk ( his favorite at the moment he said)<br/>
Gigi likes sparkling water, diet coke, root beer.<br/>
She will take a few sips of the soda but she drinks more of the sparkling water with me and she likes it just like I do ( super cold and icy from the freezer).<br/>
When my son was little and I kept soda out of the house ( mu husband is a big soda drinker and kept it in the barn) , my son would drink the whole can when he got a hold of one. I never told him no but I cringed at it.<br/>
Once I embraced having them available that all changed. He started by taking a few sips and leaving most in the can to now drinking at all.<br/>
 Nowadays we alwasy buy it and have it available. It lasts for weeks sometimes if we don&#39;t have kids over.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-508222774">-=- You have said before that you have made food suggestions to your  <br/>
kids. In particular I remember you saying that you asked Holly to wait  <br/>
until after dinner to have a sweet snack she was about to eat. You  <br/>
must have thought she wasn&#39;t making a good choice.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t remember the story, but I do believe you read it.<br/>
It strikes me, though, that you have held on to it as a justification  <br/>
for controlling your child.<br/>
<br/>
If I used that story as evidence that kids given freedom in a  <br/>
trusting, helpful atmosphere will let the parents say &quot;Maybe wait,&quot; or  <br/>
even &quot;Stop; no&quot; when the situation calls for it, that doesn&#39;t seem to  <br/>
apply to the situation with the limitations.<br/>
<br/>
My husband was a fat baby, and a fat child, and a fat teen.  His  <br/>
mother was horrible to him about it, hardly fed him, shamed him,  <br/>
laughed at him, embarrassed him.   That was more horrible than being  <br/>
fat was.  His mother was horrible, not food.  Food was comfort for him.<br/>
<br/>
My boys have the tendency to paunch up and get skinny, without working  <br/>
hard at either.  But they haven&#39;t lived with any pressure or shame.<br/>
<br/>
-=-All I want is for my son not to get diabetes, which runs in our  <br/>
family, or become obese, which surely would happen if he were to  <br/>
continue drinking nothing but soda, -=-<br/>
<br/>
SURELY?    And that is ALL you want?<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s assured that it would make him obese, nor is that  <br/>
all you want.<br/>
<br/>
I know these things are very difficult to look at.  Please patiently  <br/>
continue to examine the dark little corners of your situation.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I have let him make his choices, and now I&#39;m way past my comfort  <br/>
zone, I&#39;m worried, and I don&#39;t know what to do.-=-<br/>
<br/>
You could go to another list where they&#39;ll coo and tell you you&#39;re  <br/>
right.  That would put you back in your comfort zone, maybe.  You  <br/>
could put him back in school where they&#39;ll give him only a tiny school  <br/>
lunch, and when he gets home hungry you could have just exactly what  <br/>
you think would be best for him to eat.  That&#39;s not only legal, it&#39;s  <br/>
highly regarded by the majority of the people around you.  If  <br/>
unschooling and choices aren&#39;t something you can deal with, don&#39;t.   <br/>
There is certainly no compulsory unschooling in the world, and nobody  <br/>
has EVER said parents are required to give children choices.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Then I tried to explain why. He didn&#39;t care. I was under the  <br/>
impression that Holly acquiesced because in general she was not given  <br/>
food restrictions, so she was willing to do what you wanted in that  <br/>
case. -=-<br/>
<br/>
If your explanations were same-old-same-old, that might be why he  <br/>
didn&#39;t care.  If you were telling him that if he eats sugar he will  <br/>
get diabetes and be fat, he might just be tired of hearing that.  It&#39;s  <br/>
more like a curse than advice.  It sounds more like &quot;I hope you get  <br/>
diabetes and get fat [so I&#39;ll be right].&quot;  If you have an adversarial  <br/>
relationship, your child will not listen to you as Holly listens to  <br/>
me.   When I make a suggestion to one of my children in a social  <br/>
situation, I don&#39;t think of them &quot;acquiescing&quot; or &quot;doing what I want,&quot;  <br/>
but of me reminding them of other factors so they can see why it might  <br/>
be a good idea.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Every parent, including you, who has advocated freedom for their  <br/>
kids to eat what they feel they need, has also tried to gently steer  <br/>
them in healthy directions by putting out fruits, for example, or  <br/>
asking them to eat something substantial (like dinner) before eating  <br/>
sweets. That&#39;s the path I&#39;m trying to take, but it&#39;s hard right now. -=-<br/>
<br/>
This sounds so personal, so much about me, and other parents, rather  <br/>
than about the ideas.   If I make a big salmon salad, am I trying to  <br/>
gently steer my husband in a healthy direction?  I&#39;m probably taking  <br/>
note of the fact that we&#39;ve  had meat and potatoes one night, and then  <br/>
pizza the next, and it&#39;s about time for greens and fish.  That&#39;s not  <br/>
me being manipulative. That&#39;s me being a good partner, a better  <br/>
provider, and thoughtful mate.  If I give him salad every night and  <br/>
tell him he has no business eating pizza, or that salmon is better for  <br/>
him than beef, then I&#39;m being an adversary.  He will go and have a  <br/>
pizza with sausage and ground beef somewhere else, where I&#39;m not  <br/>
looking. Like he did with his mom.<br/>

glass right there. Just have it there - do not offer it or say anything <br/>
about it to him. Drink from it yourself, but always keep it refilled.<br/>
<br/>
Offer lots of good foods - fruits, especially. Support whatever <br/>

<br/>
LOTS of people spend some years drinking lots of soda and they don&#39;t get <br/>
terribly obese and they don&#39;t develop diabetes. Most of them eventually <br/>
cut back on the soda as they get older. I can&#39;t even tell you how many <br/>
young adult/older teens I know who say they &quot;gave up soda&quot; because they <br/>
started to want to keep their weight down.<br/>

You can do more harm than the soda can do. You can set him up for food <br/>

You must have thought she wasn&#39;t making a good choice. I was also suggesting to my son that he drink other things in addition to soda, and he got really upset.***<br/>
<br/>
The big big difference here is that Holly grew up without anyone controlling what she ate.  I imagine she was hungry and came into the kitchen to find some food, the easiest and most available may have been cookies.  Sandra, probably, in an informative way said, &quot;hey wait, because food is almost ready.&quot;, then Holly waited because she probably prefered filling up on food other than cookies.<br/>
<br/>
Your son hasn&#39;t had that.  He&#39;s upset and reacting to control which is a way different place to be in than Holly was.  If my husband told me that he felt it best that I only drink one cup of coffee a day  and then proceeded to make sure I followed these orders, it wouldn&#39;t be very relationship building and I might tell him to &quot;f**k off and mind your own business&quot;.  A mom can do the same thing to a kid and the kid may react in a similar fashion, maybe not yet as balsy to say something so direct, but they&#39;d certainly FEEL that sentiment and get really upset and cry about it.  <br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;ve seen over the years, is that kids who grow up like this, will often go one of 2 ways.. they either quietly accept what the parents tell them to do and then be sneaky about it or die a little inside, OR they outrightly rebel.  Neither of those seem like acceptable relationship building things.  I have a great relationship with my teenager, largely because I never did that &quot;do what I say&quot; controlling thing.  I took into account what SHE wanted and trusted her that she knew enough about herself to know that she knew what she was talking about.  When she makes mistakes, that&#39;s all they are, and I&#39;m here as a soft landing.<br/>
<br/>
***Every parent, including you, who has advocated freedom for their kids to eat what they feel they need, has also tried to gently steer them in healthy directions by putting out fruits, for example, or asking them to eat something substantial (like dinner) before eating sweets. That&#39;s the path I&#39;m trying to take, but it&#39;s hard right now. ***<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t gently steer my kids.  They aren&#39;t horses or cows.  They are thinking individuals with individual likes and dislikes and varying needs and wants.  If I think they might like some fruit, I&#39;ll put it out there for them.  The latest on our grocery list requests has been exactly that, in the middle of winter, but hey, we do what we can even if they want strawberries.  I have never told my kids to eat something substantial before they eat anything else.  They eat when they are hungry and generally what sounds good to them at any given time which may or may not be what I&#39;ve prepared as a meal.  My youngest daughter will often eat cookies with or before she eats a more regular meal.  Sometimes she&#39;ll eat chocolate all day one day and very little else and the next day eat zero chocolate or other sweet delights and eat sandwhiches and fruit and yogurt and fish tacos and salad and carrot sticks raw without dip.<br/>
<br/>
The only way it will cease being hard is if you stop fretting about it and trying to control things.  That actually makes living way more difficult than it needs to be.  You CAN be more relaxed and happily allow your kids and yourself to eat what you and they want.  If you are concerned about diabetes, even better to release the control and really allow your children to listen to what their bodies are telling them.<br/>

They do. Those who were at the symposium heard my three girls say things <br/>

by the fact that they were really honest and thinking for themselves and <br/>
analytical about their own lives. That&#39;s a higher priority for me than <br/>
that they always agree with me, for sure.<br/>
<br/>
Where does that come from? How did they get to be able to calmly and <br/>
easily just not agree with me, without it being a big deal? How did they <br/>
become such independent thinkers? It came from supporting them in having <br/>
their own individual ideas about little things like drinking soda or <br/>

Just this morning Holly came into the bedroom while I was still in bed  <br/>
(I was awake) with a bowl of bread pudding.  She said that the night  <br/>
before she had come home from getting a tattoo and grabbed a pumpkin  <br/>
cookie.  (Smith&#39;s here makes pumpkin chocolate chip cookies all year  <br/>
long--not look-like-a-pumpkin, but made of pumpkin.)   That&#39;s not a  <br/>
bad choice.   But then she saw there was a big pan of bread pudding,  <br/>
and was sorry she had already eaten the cookie.<br/>
<br/>
After the symposium, people gave me leftover groceries.  Lots of  <br/>
bread, lots of milk (and cream and half and half) so in order to make  <br/>
room in the fridge, I made bread pudding.   The kids really like that.<br/>
<br/>
If I said &quot;Eat bread pudding instead of [anything],&quot; it wouldn&#39;t be  <br/>
their choice and it wouldn&#39;t be as good.  Bread pudding is old-timey  <br/>
grandma food.  It&#39;s not &quot;cool&quot; or modern.  But it&#39;s comfort food for  <br/>
those who grew up with it and whose home was comforting.<br/>

<br/>
Part of the problem here is your insistence on &quot;surely&quot;. It may not happen <br/>
if he drinks soda, especially if he is active. It may still happen in the <br/>
absence of soda because it runs in your family. If he is hearing your <br/>
certainty, it might be in his natural temperment to want to prove things for <br/>
himself. That means that you are setting up a situation where one or the <br/>
other of you will have to be proven wrong. That&#39;s not a good thing for your <br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt; In particular I remember you saying that you asked Holly to wait until <br/>
after dinner to have a sweet snack she was about to eat.  You must have <br/>
thought she wasn&#39;t making a good choice.  I was also suggesting to my son <br/>
that he drink other things in addition to soda, and he got really upset. <br/>
Then I tried to explain why.  He didn&#39;t care.  I was under the impression <br/>
that Holly acquiesced because in general she was not given food <br/>
restrictions, so she was willing to do what you wanted in that case.  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sandra has many beautiful stories of Holly, Marty and Kirby acquiescing <br/>
graciously to her few requests, because of the long build up of trust <br/>
between her and her kids. She didn&#39;t have years of control to undo.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes kids have different temperaments from Holly. Jayn (10) is very <br/>
different. She reacts vigorously to many requests that she change some piece <br/>
of behavior, because she sees them as an attempt at control, even though <br/>
they are just requests and based on something real (like the time of day or <br/>
my headache). This is even though we don&#39;t have years of control to undo.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes Jayn apparently needs to go through the process of proving to <br/>
herself that she is free to say no (and she is), and come around slowly to <br/>
saying yes. She almost always does acquiese after this transitional <br/>
&quot;defiant&quot; moment. (I don&#39;t think of it as &quot;defiance&quot;, my mother would have! <br/>
Probably conventional parents witnessing it would.))<br/>
<br/>
This happens more when she has been out and about in contact with kids and <br/>
homes where there are fewer real choices given to the kids, rules, odd <br/>
arbritrary restrictions. It&#39;s as if she has to reassure herself that her <br/>
life is still free. Or something.<br/>
<br/>
So Jayn will usually acquiese, but not always graciously at first. She will <br/>
acquiese because once she has understood that she doesn&#39;t &quot;have to&quot;, then <br/>
she can see the sense in the request. Or she can make a reasoned and sane <br/>
arguement based on her prior experience why she won&#39;t agree or comply. Or <br/>
she comes up with a nice compromise that I hadn&#39;t considered.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t ask a lot of her. I almost never make any remarks about her food <br/>
choices. If she has a tummy upset at any time, we will talk about the <br/>
timeline, and what she ate and make connections. We recently came to the <br/>
still fuzzy conclusion that the sugar free kool-aid is probably making her <br/>
poops liquid (a known effect of some artificial sweetners fo some people. I <br/>
didn&#39;t mean to buy the sugar free for that reason.) It was her realization, <br/>
after we were talking over all that she had consumed over several days. I <br/>
won&#39;t have to then restrict her kool aid consumption. She will happily do <br/>
that for herself - unless she feels constipated. Then she might see it <br/>
medicinally.<br/>
<br/>
She would not be happy if I were directing her not to have kool aid. She <br/>
wouldn&#39;t like being told much more than she wouldn&#39;t like tummyache. That is <br/>
something that is inside her, Who She Is.<br/>
<br/>
There have been moments in my earlier life here on these lists with a <br/>
school-age unschooler for now 5 years (counting Kindergarten) when I have <br/>
had a certain amount of frustration because it seemed like I was doing all <br/>
the same things, broadly, as Sandra, but my little girl wasn&#39;t becoming as <br/>
sweet and easy going as Holly. Jayn almost never in her life just says yes. <br/>
Comparing one kid to another isn&#39;t a path to inner peace.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling doesn&#39;t magically change your child&#39;s temperament. It doesn&#39;t <br/>
magically make a strong willed child into an easy going child. It can <br/>
support your child&#39;s strong will, so that they get to be as happy and feel <br/>
as easy going inside themselves as an easy going kid.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling allows me to look with wonder and joy at my real child, who will <br/>
never be Holly but I think is just as cool in her own way. She will grow up <br/>
knowing herself, what she needs to be happy and what she needs to do when <br/>
she feels frustrated and unhappy.<br/>
<br/>
For me, a battle over soda, or any food, is just not worth it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt; His reaction was extreme for a 12-year-old &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
12 is often the start of puberty. It&#39;s likely to be a relatively volatile <br/>
age in any kid.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-706529251"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;i also made my own pomegranate syrup this christmas, (really really easy),<br/>
 </span></blockquote>using juice and sugar and &gt;water and lemon, and then mixed some with<br/>
sparkling water and my daughter said it was the best &gt;drink ever. like an<br/>
italian soda.<br/>
<br/>
Yummy, that sounds sooo good.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;All I want is for my son not to get diabetes, which runs in our family, or<br/>
 </span></blockquote>become obese, which surely &gt;would happen if he were to continue drinking<br/>
nothing but soda, as he has done this past week. I have &gt;let him make his<br/>
choices, and now I&#39;m way past my comfort zone, I&#39;m worried, and I don&#39;t know<br/>
what &gt;to do<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure you can prevent diabetes by banning soda.  Its not quite the<br/>
same as stopping a child from drinking rat poison.  You know if you drink<br/>
the poison you die.  If you jump out a window you die.  There are a lot of<br/>
people pushing ideas about health right now.<br/>
<br/>
I know there was one small town in Italy fifteen plus years ago with really<br/>
bad diets, really heavy smoking and drinking but  really low rates of heart<br/>
attacks.  Researchers studied and studied the population.  Turned out they<br/>
were all related and had inherited the bad diet and the genes to thrive with<br/>
it!<br/>
<br/>
Right now we are all supposed to be on the quest to eat properly as a<br/>
society--turn on any tv show to see documentaries on the evils of pop, corn<br/>
syrup, meat, or even carbs.  In most places in the world there isn&#39;t enough<br/>
food, even what we consider &quot;junk food&quot; or unhealthy food.<br/>
<br/>
But if you are in this dilemma and are looking for permission to stop your<br/>
son from drinking soda, I don&#39;t think that will happen.  Essentially, you<br/>
hold the winning hand and you can either trust you son to figure it out or<br/>
not.  We aren&#39;t your conscience, and you need to play the hand as its<br/>
dealt.  I don&#39;t want to tell you what to do.  You are obviously torn by who<br/>
you want to be and all the doubts.  It is better for your son if you figure<br/>
this out before you deliver ultimatums.  The idea that this week mom is<br/>
giving me all I can drink, but next week its nothing but water will drive<br/>
him to drink more than he may want in preparation for the coming dry spell.<br/>
<br/>
You cannot get people on this list to agree to stopping your son from<br/>
drinking pop.  That&#39;s okay though.  All they give is their experience or<br/>
opinion.<br/>
<br/>
You want to call yourself an unschooler.  We all get that, but if its<br/>
causing you a lot of grief step back and figure out what about this doesn&#39;t<br/>
sit well with soda pop drinking.  You need to ask yourself what is behind<br/>
your fears.  Can you get your son tested to see if he is at risk for<br/>
diabetes?  If we guaranteed he couldn&#39;t get sick how would you change your<br/>
behavior?  Maybe that&#39;s the thing you need to know.  Are you sure this is<br/>
not about something other than health?<br/>

 <br/>
If only there was a way to gaurantee health!  Something I consider when thinking about something like what my kids eat or drink, is the fact that right now they are alive to tell me what they want and how wonderful that is.  How terrible I would feel if one of my kids became terminally ill or died suddenly, and how guilty that would cause me to feel if my last interaction with that child had been shaming them about a beverage and having them run away crying!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1366113716">-=-Sandra has many beautiful stories of Holly, Marty and Kirby  <br/>

between her and her kids. She didn&#39;t have years of control to undo.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think these qualify at all as &quot;beautiful&quot; stories, but there  <br/>
were three times during last week&#39;s symposium that I told Marty to do  <br/>
something. Twice he did it.  Once he didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
The first was when Joyce was talking. I wanted him to sit back down  <br/>
because I was trying to take his picture but he hadn&#39;t known it.  It  <br/>
made Pam laugh and Joyce said we couldn&#39;t laugh unless she had said  <br/>
something funny, so Pam explained.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the photo I took after I told him to Sit Down! (and he did)<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://i26.photobucket.com/albums/c111/SandraDodd/New%20Mexico/SantaFe/SUSS2010/kdk_2138.jpg">http://i26.photobucket.com/albums/c111/SandraDodd/New%20Mexico/SantaFe/SUSS2010/kdk_2138.jpg</a><br/>
<br/>
I had wanted a photo of his hat and Rosie&#39;s.  I didn&#39;t mean to disrupt  <br/>
Joyce&#39;s talk.<br/>
<br/>
During the teen panel, at some point, Marty put his foot up on the  <br/>
table and I said &quot;Marty, don&#39;t,&quot; from across the room.  He took his  <br/>
foot down.<br/>
<br/>
Oh.  I had told him quietly at some point not to lean back in his  <br/>
chair, before they started.  Sometime during their talk he totally  <br/>
tipped the chair back and fell.  So that&#39;s one of those times God took  <br/>
my side and dumped Marty (gently, and humorously) on his butt, so  <br/>
that&#39;s more powerful than me having nagged and insisted.   I got to be  <br/>
on Marty&#39;s team AND &quot;be right.&quot;  But I wouldn&#39;t wish it in any case of  <br/>
disease, death, or loss of an eye.<br/>
<br/>
And then while I was speaking once he was flipping cards up in the  <br/>
air, and they were some of the special poker cards Kirby had gotten  <br/>
for Christmas from Blizzard, where he works.  I asked Marty if he&#39;d  <br/>
like some regular cards to do that with, and he said no.   That wasn&#39;t  <br/>
a big deal.  I could have made a big deal.  If Kirby had been in the  <br/>
room and said &quot;stop,&quot; Marty would&#39;ve.  I&#39;m not sure Kirby would&#39;ve  <br/>
said stop.   No cards were harmed.  No relationships were harmed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1176974951">okay...guilty of hyperbole, again&lt;lol&gt;...all things being equal you drink<br/>
rat poison instead of pop and in the same quantity and the result is<br/>
definitely unhealthy.  The goal of the poison is to kill the rats, so<br/>
ingesting it is not good.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking about risky behavior.  I think the example on this list last<br/>
year was about the Grand Canyon and tree climbing.  Remember?  Some risk is<br/>
part of freedom, but it is about acceptable risks and degree of danger.  I<br/>
don&#39;t think I am phrasing the ideas in a coherent manner, sorry.<br/>

Puberty is unsettling to any kid that&#39;s going through it!  What I&#39;ve heard, from boys especially, is that they fight more with their parents during and after because their thoughts and needs aren&#39;t being acknowledged in the manner in which they should be.  Where previously, they felt like kids and accepted parents laying down the law, but during and after puberty, they don&#39;t FEEL like kids anymore and they&#39;d like their ideas and thoughts to be acknowledged as equally valid as any other non-kid person.  I&#39;m paraphrasing what I&#39;ve heard repeatedly among teen boys.  I&#39;m sure there are girls that go through that too, but it&#39;s been more commonly expressed among the boys that I&#39;ve talked to.<br/>
<br/>
Moms with 12 yr old boys aren&#39;t raising kids anymore, they are helping to raise men.  They WILL distance themselves greatly unless moms can back off and be more aware of her actions and more mindful of the relationship that&#39;s being created.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-768091537">Teen boys need lots of calories.  I have one who is fourteen years old;)<br/>
<br/>
I often think that the fast food market that developed in the early 1950&#39;s<br/>
hasn&#39;t been examined from that perspective--that many of the people in that<br/>
population were growing teen boys, who needed cheap and filling<br/>
food. We have soda pop, because they couldn&#39;t drink hard liquor and lots of<br/>
burgers and fries entrees because their growing bodies needed the calories!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Eating that way as an older person though is probably going to lead to<br/>
unwanted weight gain.<br/>
