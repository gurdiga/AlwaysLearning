&gt;I get great pleasure in telling all about what he does and how he only has to <br/>
&gt;work about 4-6 months out of the year because he has handled his finances and <br/>
&gt;career so well!!!  I know their teacher jobs pay so well.  [:)] <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, not only that, he&#39;s a welder, which is a really hard job to keep <br/>
doing for years and years, and thus is in high demand.  He can sell <br/>
himself to the highest bidder any time he wants.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m impressed.  :)<br/>
