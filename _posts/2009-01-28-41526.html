<div id="ygrps-yiv-1182668437">Hello-<br/>
<br/>
I have a question -- well really a few questions -- about some things<br/>
that I think you all could help me with. I&#39;ll give you some<br/>
background. My daughter is 2 1/2. She is currently IN LOVE with Dora,<br/>
which means that it is either on the TV or computer whenever we are<br/>
home. (and on the DVD player in the car too!) Currently we are home a<br/>
lot for various reasons -- I babysit two other children and it is<br/>
winter here so we haven&#39;t been getting out as much as I like. <br/>
<br/>
Intellectually I have really embraced unschooling and having no<br/>
restrictions on TV, but I know that I am still struggling with it<br/>
because I have been thinking a lot about it lately. I have a couple of<br/>
concerns.<br/>
<br/>
My first concern is that maybe I am not doing enough other things to<br/>
engage her. I realize that this is not a question that you can answer<br/>
since you do not know our daily life and how we interact. I guess I am<br/>
more wondering if she is happy and I talk on the phone for half an<br/>
hour, is that ok? (I&#39;m thinking of Sandra&#39;s chart and how much time<br/>
you spend with your child based on age) Or cleaning up... or anything<br/>
else. I often watch with her and know all the story lines, and can<br/>
talk with her about it etc. I am also very aware of making sure to get<br/>
her food, make sure she&#39;s comfortable etc. But she is only 2 1/2 -- I<br/>
guess I think if I were trying harder to do more different things she<br/>
might watch less. But then I get in an argument with myself -- is less<br/>
better? This seems to be what she really wants right now. Today I<br/>
wanted to go outside and play in the snow and she really insisted that<br/>
she wanted to stay and watch Dora. I tried convincing her for about an<br/>
hour. Then I feel bad because I don&#39;t want her to think that I am not<br/>
listening to her (we didn&#39;t end up going out). However, she often<br/>
changes her mind after saying no several times, and I know she would<br/>
have had fun outside. It was a rare free morning for us and I wanted<br/>
to respect her wish to stay in as much as I wanted to go out. But when<br/>
do you start (or do you ever?) saying that &quot;Mommy wants to do this now<br/>
and we will do more of what you want later?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry this is long and convoluted. I had a really long<br/>
philosophical conversation with my mom about parenting. I am very<br/>
lucky to have an open minded and supportive mother, but I know she<br/>
even struggles with all these ideas I have. I&#39;m having a hard time<br/>
straightening this out in my mind, it seems like there are too many<br/>
considerations. But I think to answer my own question, I have to keep<br/>
our relationship first in my mind (my daughter&#39;s and mine) and I<br/>
always think that if I am feeling guilty than maybe that means I<br/>
should be offering (strewing) more (or more involved). Any input would<br/>
be greatly appreciated! I really feel like with kids, even really<br/>
little ones, most people in our society thinks, they need to learn<br/>
that they don&#39;t always get their way, or to entertain themselves, or<br/>
many other things... So I still have many voices in my head that I are<br/>
in disagreement with each other.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-741092755">Jayn used to love Max and Ruby like that - we recorded every episode, I <br/>
bought DVD&#39;s when we could. We have stuffed Max and Ruby too. She liked <br/>
Dora, and we have a bunch of the dolls, but it was not the same adoration as <br/>
Max and Ruby. Now she&#39;s 9. She doesn&#39;t care about Max and Ruby at all.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover she will also, now, happily leave a recording of any of her current <br/>
favorite to play, and know that she can come back to it later.<br/>
<br/>
Part of it is experience - knowing that she really will have the opportunity <br/>
to watch again later, regardless of how often she has watched an episode.<br/>
<br/>
Part of it is maturity - she has a much clearer understanding of time, and <br/>
time passing now. &quot;Later&quot; doesn&#39;t feel like forever to her any more. She is <br/>
more willing to allow me something.<br/>
<br/>
If I were you I would find something to do near her and continue to invite <br/>
her outside or elsewhere when the episode is over. I might even go on <br/>
outside and play in the snow and enjoy it - even if she didn&#39;t come out <br/>
until her show was over.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;But when<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; do you start (or do you ever?) saying that &quot;Mommy wants to do this now<br/>
&gt; and we will do more of what you want later?&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For me the answer to that is &quot;when it is genuinely essential&quot;. The store <br/>
will absolutely be closed, this is when my doctor&#39;s appointment is, the <br/>
plane leaves at this time. If the consequences would impact Jayn negatively <br/>
I tell her that too. I don&#39;t think missing playing in the snow really fits <br/>
this.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn has become much more patient and tolerant of my activities with <br/>
maturity also. And yes, I love it when she is happy to watch tv for a whole <br/>
half hour - but usually she still wants stuff and attention from me as well <br/>
during those times.<br/>
<br/>
Off to do some cleaning - Jayn&#39;s idea.<br/>

you, cool!  I&#39;m assuming you&#39;d be willing to say &quot;Oh, gotta go&quot; to  <br/>

With Kirby it was Ninja Turtles.  He LOVED that show, for many years.   <br/>
I knew all the characters.  I scouted out board games and action  <br/>
figures for him.  I encouraged and maintained his collections.  I  <br/>
didn&#39;t always sit and watch it with him, but I did often enough to ask  <br/>
intelligent questions and to know what he was talking about if he  <br/>
wanted to discuss what the foot clan might be like in other stories,  <br/>
or about the differences between the comics and the TV show.<br/>
<br/>

Was it recorded?  Was it something you could record and then come in  <br/>
and watch later?<br/>
That would make a big difference.<br/>
<br/>
Was it snowing, or had it already stopped snowing?  Another difference.<br/>
<br/>
In the future instead of wheedling for an hour, maybe spend some of  <br/>
that energy thinking of a clear and interesting proposal to make about  <br/>
WHAT to do in the snow and why and where and what would make it really  <br/>
memorable and fantastic.<br/>

These might help.  Even if you&#39;ve looked at them before, looking again  <br/>
with this snow-and-Dora situation in mind might help you find some  <br/>
clarity.<br/>
<br/>
There ARE many considerations, but if you work from a principle and  <br/>
make the better choice, you&#39;re not floundering in what seems to be an  <br/>
endless landscape of &quot;what if&quot;s.<br/>

When things are needful like shopping for groceries, Karl has rarely enjoyed<br/>
grocery shopping or shopping in general and we bring the gameboy or DS with<br/>
us so that Karl has something he really likes to do while we shop *and*<br/>
we&#39;re all together, which Karl loves since his dad works long hours.<br/>

possible to bring the dvd player for use with Dora videos on a flight.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-849331483">Thanks for this post because we have had much the same issue with our<br/>
two year old daughter but for her it&#39;s Sesame Street, Maisy, and<br/>
Signing Time. She&#39;s bounced back and forth but is absolutely obsessed<br/>
when she decides it&#39;s time for one. ie she didn&#39;t care about signing<br/>
time for 6 months and now she&#39;s obsessed again but is picking up a ton<br/>
of new signs and words. Problem is she would spend the greater part of<br/>
her day watching if she could and all I can think of is all the<br/>
studies about how rapidly changing images are so bad for the little<br/>
ones :( We try to spend time inbetween or watch with her when we can<br/>
but we&#39;ve got a budding business and have had to spend a lot of time<br/>
lately working (in our home). <br/>
<br/>
didn&#39;t mean to try to hijack, just curious how this might differ since<br/>
she&#39;s a bit younger. <br/>

Do you have those shows on DVD or tivo?  LET her watch as much as she  <br/>

Actually they are all on the computer, a DVD, or our DVR -- so all may<br/>
be watched later and I&#39;m pretty sure that she understands that because<br/>
she will sometimes &quot;pause&quot; them voluntarily. I think it may be more<br/>
her age, or the level of her love right now, and also what you said<br/>
about later just seeming too long from now.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Was it snowing, or had it already stopped snowing?  Another difference.&lt;<br/>

Good point. It was not snowing at that moment, and it was the day<br/>
before when she agreed to go out.<br/>

that energy thinking of a clear and interesting proposal to make about<br/>

<br/>
I tried to do this but probably not in the most effective way. I AM<br/>
getting better at coming up with things that will entice her, so that<br/>
she is the one that finally chooses to do something with me. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1332497468">Could you buy a handheld dvd player?  I saw some designed for small<br/>
children that were between 100 and 150, I think.  The screen was<br/>
small, but they were supposed to be pretty sturdy.  Perhaps she would<br/>
be more amenable to transitioning to the handheld at the end of the<br/>
episode.  You could go to the park or take a walk and she could sit<br/>
down and watch her show if she wanted to or run around and play if she<br/>
wanted to do that.  We live in a rural area and so I play tv in the<br/>
car for the kids when we have a long ride ahead of us.  It makes<br/>
transitions out of the house easier.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, it might help to select one episode instead of play all... it just<br/>
wraps around and plays over and over again.  Be available to start the<br/>
next one, of course, without any negativity about watching another<br/>
episode.  If it stops, it is easier to have a minute break to talk<br/>
about what would be most fun to do next.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t have them already, there are Dora duplo sets and there is<br/>
a Dora dollhouse.  Maybe if you had interesting exciting things in the<br/>
area where she watches TV you could feel more comfortable that she is<br/>
watching TV because she really wants to, not because she doesn&#39;t see<br/>
the other options.   Might be fun to play with the dollhouse or build<br/>
things during the episodes too.<br/>
<br/>
We have a small trampoline and legos near the TV and a whole bunch of<br/>
toys nearby, but not right right next to the TV.   We rearrange things<br/>
depending on what is interested and there are several areas with fun<br/>
things (toys, art table, etc.) where they can see the TV and play.<br/>
<br/>
We downloaded some dora video games from bigfishgames.  They had a 1<br/>
hour trial so you can try them first to see if she can play them (or<br/>
enjoys playing with you).   I know that there were games my two year<br/>
old could play, but he can use the computer and our Wii quite well.<br/>
He liked the diego dinosaur game the most, but there was a dora game<br/>
that both my kids liked too.<br/>
<br/>
If you are worried about her doing it alone while you get things done,<br/>
perhaps you could find something you can do while sitting with her.<br/>
Reading?  Knitting?  She might interact with you more if she is on<br/>
your lap, even if you are looking at something else.  Maybe you could<br/>
do that more often, even if you still do talk on the phone or clean up<br/>
during some of the time when she is watching Dora.<br/>

&gt; Hello-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have a question -- well really a few questions -- about some things<br/>
&gt; that I think you all could help me with. I&#39;ll give you some<br/>
&gt; background. My daughter is 2 1/2. She is currently IN LOVE with Dora,<br/>
&gt; which means that it is either on the TV or computer whenever we are<br/>
&gt; home. (and on the DVD player in the car too!) Currently we are home a<br/>
&gt; lot for various reasons -- I babysit two other children and it is<br/>
&gt; winter here so we haven&#39;t been getting out as much as I like.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Intellectually I have really embraced unschooling and having no<br/>
&gt; restrictions on TV, but I know that I am still struggling with it<br/>
&gt; because I have been thinking a lot about it lately. I have a couple of<br/>
&gt; concerns.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My first concern is that maybe I am not doing enough other things to<br/>
&gt; engage her. I realize that this is not a question that you can answer<br/>
&gt; since you do not know our daily life and how we interact. I guess I am<br/>
&gt; more wondering if she is happy and I talk on the phone for half an<br/>
&gt; hour, is that ok? (I&#39;m thinking of Sandra&#39;s chart and how much time<br/>
&gt; you spend with your child based on age) Or cleaning up... or anything<br/>
&gt; else. I often watch with her and know all the story lines, and can<br/>
&gt; talk with her about it etc. I am also very aware of making sure to get<br/>
&gt; her food, make sure she&#39;s comfortable etc. But she is only 2 1/2 -- I<br/>
&gt; guess I think if I were trying harder to do more different things she<br/>
&gt; might watch less. But then I get in an argument with myself -- is less<br/>
&gt; better? This seems to be what she really wants right now. Today I<br/>
&gt; wanted to go outside and play in the snow and she really insisted that<br/>
&gt; she wanted to stay and watch Dora. I tried convincing her for about an<br/>
&gt; hour. Then I feel bad because I don&#39;t want her to think that I am not<br/>
&gt; listening to her (we didn&#39;t end up going out). However, she often<br/>
&gt; changes her mind after saying no several times, and I know she would<br/>
&gt; have had fun outside. It was a rare free morning for us and I wanted<br/>
&gt; to respect her wish to stay in as much as I wanted to go out. But when<br/>
&gt; do you start (or do you ever?) saying that &quot;Mommy wants to do this now<br/>
&gt; and we will do more of what you want later?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m sorry this is long and convoluted. I had a really long<br/>
&gt; philosophical conversation with my mom about parenting. I am very<br/>
&gt; lucky to have an open minded and supportive mother, but I know she<br/>
&gt; even struggles with all these ideas I have. I&#39;m having a hard time<br/>
&gt; straightening this out in my mind, it seems like there are too many<br/>
&gt; considerations. But I think to answer my own question, I have to keep<br/>
&gt; our relationship first in my mind (my daughter&#39;s and mine) and I<br/>
&gt; always think that if I am feeling guilty than maybe that means I<br/>
&gt; should be offering (strewing) more (or more involved). Any input would<br/>
&gt; be greatly appreciated! I really feel like with kids, even really<br/>
&gt; little ones, most people in our society thinks, they need to learn<br/>
&gt; that they don&#39;t always get their way, or to entertain themselves, or<br/>
&gt; many other things... So I still have many voices in my head that I are<br/>
&gt; in disagreement with each other.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks again!<br/>

Here&#39;s something I wrote about my son&#39;s fascination with Dora, and<br/>
what came of it:<br/>

<br/>
Right now both my boys (they&#39;re 6 and 3) are TV-obsessed. We just hit<br/>
the Pokemon stage, actually, and I&#39;m learning more about that than I<br/>
learned about any of the previous phases. And I&#39;m already plotting<br/>
forays into other anime (although they already love Howl&#39;s Moving<br/>
Castle, so there&#39;s precedent...<br/>
<br/>
I thought about being freaked out about the sheer amount of screen<br/>
time they&#39;re getting. But when there are other things that catch their<br/>
attention, they move on, and this sounds goofy, but it&#39;s still clearly<br/>
a choice they&#39;re making. The TV has not made them mind-controlled<br/>
zombies; they are genuinely choosing this, despite all kinds of other<br/>
offers of things to do with their time.<br/>

That is a great story, thanks for sharing! It is so amazing how much<br/>
kids learn all the time. I have really appreciated all of the feedback<br/>
and ideas that people have given to me. The best part is that I am<br/>
actually doing many of the ideas given to me already which made me<br/>
feel much better. <br/>
<br/>
It definitely takes practice to really, REALLY give your child a<br/>
choice and mean it -- especially when you really, REALLY want to do<br/>
one thing. I am working on it though! And I am also learning that<br/>
there are other ways to get my needs met while respecting Marisol&#39;s<br/>
choices. For example, the day after Marisol did NOT want to play in<br/>
the snow and I tried to convince her for so long, we were supposed to<br/>
go to a music class in the morning. I mentioned it a couple times and<br/>
reminded her of all the fun things that we do there. I think I asked<br/>
her 2 times, (ok, maybe 3!) if she wanted to go and she didn&#39;t, so we<br/>
stayed home (and watched Dora of course!) In my mind I&#39;m worrying,<br/>
what if we start skipping every week? We paid for the course, etc.<br/>
etc. But I know that the money is gone, I know that we were happy that<br/>
morning, and I know that it is likely that we will make most of the<br/>
remaining classes, so I feel good about that.<br/>
<br/>
Also later in the day instead of getting out, I opened a window for<br/>
fresh air, put some exercise DVDs on the TV and Marisol, myself, and<br/>
the 1 year old girl I babysit all &quot;danced&quot; and ran around the<br/>
apartment. They loved it! I&#39;m also trying to walk on the weekends when<br/>
my husband is home so I am getting some of the fresh air and exercise<br/>
that I am craving.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for all the input!<br/>
<br/>

Could you tell more about why you asked her?<br/>
<br/>
I would have said excitedly the night before that the next day was  <br/>
music class so we needed to get up and go at X-o&#39;clock, and then wake  <br/>
her up happily, reminding her of how much I liked the the class and  <br/>
wish there had been one when I was little (and I wouldn&#39;t be acting,  <br/>
I really DO love music and get-together), and that it&#39;s nearly time  <br/>
to go.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t have stopped to say &quot;Do you want to go?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If she really didn&#39;t want to go, the whimpering or foot-dragging  <br/>
would be a clue, but did you just flat out ask her &quot;Do you want to go?&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1252711345">I always appreciate your responses and view point. I can tell you<br/>
more. I think how you described things is how I go about getting us<br/>
ready most of the time too. I say, &quot;Today is music class!&quot; And I am<br/>
excited and happy, and we normally get out on time etc. The reason<br/>
this morning was different is that we were actually making up a class<br/>
that we missed earlier in the week (we missed it due to sleeping in,<br/>
due to Marisol recently dropping her nap, on that morning sleep was<br/>
more important than music). <br/>
<br/>
So, this particular morning, it was actually ME dragging my feet more<br/>
than her. It was friday morning after a long week of babysitting and a<br/>
rare free morning for us. Because our schedule is often dictated by<br/>
who I am babysitting I felt more freedom. There are 3 music classes<br/>
each spaced an hour apart. We can go to any of them. She was having a<br/>
great time playing at home and I was putzing. When the last class<br/>
approached I told her that if we were going to go we had to get ready.<br/>
She didn&#39;t want to so I dropped it.<br/>
<br/>
That was kind of the whole situation! I like what you said about how<br/>
you would do things though.<br/>
