married a Brit and I&#39;ve met another one of the same who lives a <br/>
few miles away and has two girls. We&#39;ve become great friends, <br/>
and even though her girls go to public school, they&#39;re really <br/>
sweet kids &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

Don&#39;t remember big noses in Derbyshire just some kind of caves with blue<br/>
stones -- it was one of those memorable school field trip.<br/>

Maybe not, (I&#39;m trying to figure out how) but the two words look so similar.<br/>
