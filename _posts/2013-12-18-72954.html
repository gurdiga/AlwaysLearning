<div id="ygrps-yiv-1835739764"><div dir="ltr">I was really struck by Alex&#39;s (I think) explanation of the need to identify and pick apart fears for unschooling to work. (Apologies if it was someone else&#39;s words - they&#39;ve been swimming in my head for days but can&#39;t find them now to quote!).<div>

<br></div><div>So, I have a very real fear that comes up time and time again for me and my husband that I&#39;d really love some help unpicking because I have known for a long time that it is harmful and causes more fears that I won&#39;t ever get to the bottom of it, or not &#39;in time&#39; anyway. And it is this: My daughter&#39;s plumpness...and my own.<br>

<br>My ten year old daughter is plump. I think she is &#39;officially&#39; just overweight. She also has low self-esteem often putting herself last and speaking unkind words about herself. Sometimes she is super confident and happy. Others she is not. She has started puberty early and she is a girl who has dreaded growing up. She doesn&#39;t wash very often and I wonder if part of this is not wanting to see her changing body. She sees her clothes say an older age in them than she actually is (ie. 11-12 instead of 10-11). Her three sisters are all very lean. She is a really lovely girl, who has obviously been affected by my own mental ill health over the years (which is now resolved...we are on healing the children now!).</div>

<div><br></div><div>My husband fears her plumpness and I do too. We are not sure if it is her future health we are worried about, her looks or her future self-esteem and sense of self-worth. Many plump women (myself included) frequently feel unhappy about the way they look...it makes me cry sometimes if I&#39;m trying on clothes or getting ready for a special night out. Neither of us want that for her, but I&#39;m not sure how to help her not learn that horrible trait when I can&#39;t unlearn it myself!<br>

<br>She eats an OK diet but is fairly sedentary and if there&#39;s a food she likes she&#39;ll eat masses of it...she refuses to eat completely if there&#39;s nothing she likes. I&#39;m not sure she has a particularly healthy relationship with food. Like me she has never enjoyed being out of puff but I always thought I was put off sports by school but maybe not, now I see one of my daughters being the same. I now dance once or twice a week, but I&#39;m rubbish at not over-eating. I have a psychological attachment to &#39;treat&#39; foods I think because it&#39;s what we got when we went to visit my absent father, in particular McDonalds. Neither myself nor my daughter is obese. I am a size 12 (UK) but I&#39;m only 5&#39;1&quot;. I know rationally speaking we have nothing to worry about. We are both healthy.<br>

</div><div><br></div><div>Just to add, my husband is lean and fit and enjoys running. But he has low self-esteem. I don&#39;t have low self-esteem apart from about my weight. What a muddle! But it is so, so hard not to say &#39;don&#39;t eat any more&#39; when she wants seconds...and thirds of pasta but I know the worst thing to do is to make food an issue...but it&#39;s an issue in our heads and she&#39;ll be picking that up even if we don&#39;t verbalise it. And I know the only way to stop it being in our heads is to dissolve the fear through examination of it (as we did with the tv and the computer)</div>
<div><br></div><div>I&#39;m going to sit back this time (have learnt my lesson!) and read and digest slowly rather than keep replying (many thanks for your patience over the bedtime thing - have continued to read :)). I&#39;m sure I am not the only mother for whom her own weight is an issue for her in her head and who worries that that issue may transfer itself to her daughters.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2132750031"><p dir="ltr">Have you tried sharing with her about how you feel? About your own thoughts, about your own weight?  It may open up a discussion,  and you may be able to understand it from her perspective. <br>
Also, I would suggest banana island. It would be something you both could do as a team, and then share with one another how you feel, and about the clarity of your minds. In the process, you both loose weight! <br>
I am a raw foodist, and have been for almost a year. I was a bit plumped,  and that is why I tried it. Once I did, I got cleared. My thoughts got much more positive, I lost weight and took on the raw food lifestyle as my new journey. I am not asking for you to do the same, but I have been where you are and I understand your concerns about your daughter.  Maybe presenting banana island in a fun way, she would be up for it!<br>

Now what is banana island?<br>
Banana island is when you eat only bananas for an extended period. I have done it for two weeks at a time, and the very first time I did it I got a lot out of it. For people that have or may have an unhealthy relationship with food, banana island helps a lot. You can look up Dr. Douglas N. Graham. He does it with some of his patients to help with food situations. <br>

Now, I know this is not a group for nutrition,  rather than unschooling, but I felt that little info could help.<br>
Also you can look up Freele the banana girl. She was my inspiration. Seeing how plumped she was before she reached her current weight kept me on track. Also, I&#39;m not sure if you are familiar with EFT, but that will help erase all your negative thoughts, freeing you both from over eating.<br>

Best of luck<br>

    I have four daughters.&nbsp; My second is plumper.&nbsp; I think being at home
    and not having to deal with &quot;mean girls&quot; has helped her not to be
    overly conscious of her body.&nbsp; We continually complement her on who
    she is rather than how she looks.&nbsp; We do this for all our girls but
    she has point blank asked if she is pretty.&nbsp; The words/love/smiles
    you pour into your daughter will go much farther in her self esteem
    than losing 20 pounds. <br>
    <br>
    If it eases your mind I hit 140 pounds by age 13 and give or take 10
    pounds have stayed that weight for 27 years.&nbsp; Plumpness at a young
    age does not mean a lifetime of obesity.&nbsp; A little plumpness is not
    near as unhealthy as an eating disorder.&nbsp; Plumpness is way better
    than being unloved (by others or yourself).&nbsp; A little plumpness is
    better than no body fat at all if you want to have children.&nbsp; If you
    need to lose weight I suggest BOTH of you go out for walks.&nbsp; Make it
    a special time to encourage her and listen to whatever she wants to
    talk about.<br>

<div><br></div><div>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;My husband fears her plumpness and I do too. We are not sure if it is her future health we are worried about, her looks or her future self-esteem and sense of self-worth. Many plump women (myself included) frequently feel unhappy about the way they look...it makes me cry sometimes if I&#39;m trying on clothes or getting ready for a special night out. Neither of us want that for her, but I&#39;m not sure how to help her not learn that horrible trait when I can&#39;t unlearn it myself!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br>You are both still equating being thin to being happy , healthy and beautiful. I saw something awesome the other day. It was pictures of various athletes to compare bodies . They were all different. From plump to thin! Soft to muscular. All Olympic athletes!<br><br>http://www.mymodernmet.com/profiles/blogs/howard-schatz-beverly-ornstein-athlete<br><br>

<br>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;She eats an OK diet but is fairly sedentary and if there&#39;s a food she likes she&#39;ll eat masses of it...she refuses to eat completely if there&#39;s nothing she likes. I&#39;m not sure she has a particularly healthy relationship with food. Like me she has never enjoyed being out of puff but I always thought I was put off sports by school but maybe not, now I see one of my daughters being the same. I now dance once or twice a week, but I&#39;m rubbish at not over-eating. I have a psychological attachment to &#39;treat&#39; foods I think because it&#39;s what we got when we went to visit my absent father, in particular McDonalds. Neither myself nor my daughter is obese. I am a size 12 (UK) but I&#39;m only 5&#39;1&quot;. I know rationally speaking we have nothing to worry about. We are both healthy.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br>Stop seeing sizes. Dance for the joy of it and don&#39;t think about losing weight. Have at
 home all the food you love in abundance. <br>Have the foods your daughter likes a home. Offer a huge variety. Don&#39;t say anything about eating to her. Just bring her food. All kids, fruits, veggies, what she likes.&nbsp; Offer lots of water and drinks ( I know I eat when I am thirsty!) <br><br>How can she look at herself and love herself if she is like you and you don;t like yourself???<br>

</div><div><br></div><div>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Just to add, my husband is lean and fit and enjoys running. But he has low self-esteem. I don&#39;t have low self-esteem apart from about my weight. What a muddle! But it is so, so hard not to say &#39;don&#39;t eat any more&#39; when she wants seconds...and thirds of pasta but I know the worst thing to do is to make food an issue...but it&#39;s an issue in our heads and she&#39;ll be picking that up even if we don&#39;t verbalise it. And I know the only way to stop it being in our heads is to dissolve the fear through examination of it (as we did with the tv and the computer)&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br><br>I am glad you are examining it.&nbsp; <br><br>Love your daughter just like she is. Love yourself. Go out and get you some sexy clothes you feel good in it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don&#39;t try to look like anyone. Be your beautiful self. Show your daughter how beautiful you are
 and how to love your body. DO NOT complain about your body. I think that is the biggest mistake mothers do.<br>It is not Barbie that creates body issues in girls. It comes , most times, from their own mothers.<br></div><br>Alex Polikowsky <br></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt;"><div style="font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:12pt;"> </div> </div>  </html></div>

It still really hurt that THAT is what my mother noticed and said to me.

Very very slim. I still made every effort not to &quot;praise&quot; their slimness nor comment on that very much, although other people did, and it was probably considered a good thing. When my daughter turned 7 she put on a lot of weight. She got a solid middle. She grew many inches and now, at almost 10, she is very tall, has large feet, and while she is not slim, she doesnt look as plump as she did. She is growing in her own way. She thinks she looks great and loves fashion and clothes and makes her own designs and likes to model them and take photos of them. She has body confidence and self confidence. She enjoys going to the trampoline place, to they gymnastic center, loves to swim. She is pretty unselfconscious in a swimsuit.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Appearances matter. I try to help my daughter understand what people will think if she wears dirty or smelly clothing, for example. I want her to feel attractive and healthy and confident.

And, no diet is good for any child especially one that focuses on only one food group.  <br/><br/>I am learning to stop bashing my own body in front of my children.  It is hard.  Really hard, but if that&#39;s what you do then that might be a place to start.  It takes a conscious effort.  <br/><br/>I have the opposite problem.  My daughter is Chinese, 9 years old and super thin.  You can see all of the bones in her spine and when you pick her up you feel like you are going to crush her.  She stands in front of the mirror admiring how thin she is.  Look how skinny I am, Mom?  It makes me crazy.  So, in our house the focus is on talking about being healthy when it comes up.  I don&#39;t make a point of talking  about it though.  <br/><br/>Sherry<br/><br/><br/>Sent from Yahoo! Mail for iPad</td></tr></table>            <div

<div id="ygrps-yiv-153142926">Rather than focusing on what you perceive as wrong with your daughter -- whether it be her weight or her attitude -- focus on what you can change about yourself and about the home life you provide. Don&#39;t try to fix her. She is who she is right now as part of her becoming who she will become. Sometimes the in-between stages are awkward as kids try to adjust to and make sense of changes. She&#39;s trying out ideas now. She&#39;s discovering what feels right about those ideas and what feels wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Create a home life you believe in. Live the values you believe in. Create a safe, respectful environment for others to explore what they value.<br/>
<br/>
If you think it&#39;s important for family members to be critical of others and notice their flaws, then be that. It won&#39;t work well with unschooling! But be that if that&#39;s a value you want your daughter to experience and perhaps adopt for herself.<br/>
<br/>
If having more healthful food is important to you, bring that into the home. Cook meals that your family likes that are more healthful. But do it because that&#39;s what you want to provide for your family.<br/>
<br/>
And then let each family member add what they enjoy or want to try to that foundation. Let her choose what she wants to eat. If she asks for a bag of Fritos, get her Fritos. If she wants 3rd helpings of pasta, smile and say &quot;Sure!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If having a more active lifestyle is important, add more activity into your lives. But choose activities because they&#39;re fun not because your daughter is plump or because you don&#39;t like your weight. Choose activities everyone enjoys not to get them to change but because you love doing things with your family.<br/>
<br/>
She can&#39;t discover that something that initially feels right doesn&#39;t work in the long run if you take her choice away. She can&#39;t discover that other choices will work better for her if there aren&#39;t other choices in her life that are drawing to her.<br/>

<p style="font-style:normal;font-size:13px;background-color:transparent;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;"><br></p><p>I love the idea of being open with your daughter about your own struggles in a way that doesn&#39;t blame fat.  Make an effort to admire all sorts of figures.  Admire them out loud.  Admire the diversity which the human form comes in.  Put pictures up of women you admire for reasons other than their looks.  Have books with pictures of all sorts of women&#39;s bodies, bodies that aren&#39;t airbrushed.  Admire them with your daughter.  There are lots of books for daughters to help them love themselves inside and out.  Read one with your daughter.  Spend time in front of the mirror without your clothes on.  Admire yourself.  Find something, anything to admire about the parts of your body your normally bash on.    Those are just a few of the ideas you&#39;ll come across in the wonderful books that are out there on this subject.  </p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-200174641"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I&#39;m not sure how to help her not learn that horrible trait when I can&#39;t unlearn it myself!&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Be careful what you tell yourself.  You *can* learn to appreciate yourself the way you are.  You have the perfect motivation for moving in that direction...Your daughter.<br/>
<br/>
I have a bit of a self-deprecating sense of humour.  My son really doesn&#39;t like it, so I&#39;ve needed to learn not to talk that way around him.  He told me once &quot;You&#39;re great.&quot;  I responded with a chuckle and the offhanded comment &quot;I&#39;m okay.&quot;  He said &quot;No.  You&#39;re great, and you need to know that.&quot;  In that moment I realized that it really mattered to *him* what *I* thought of myself.  It also mattered to him that I understood just how much he thought of me.  <br/>
<br/>
Your size, or attractiveness, or grace, or intelligence are irrelevant in the adoring eyes of your children.  What they need to see from you is what it looks like to embrace the features that make you uniquely you.  It&#39;s what we do with what we have that allows us move closer to reaching our full potential.  <br/>
<br/>
Again, try to be mindful of not using language (even to yourself) that causes you to hit a wall.  <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1763584661"><p>I&#39;d like to add one more thought to the discussion. &nbsp;I&#39;ve seen several people mention not to encourage or bring up dieting, but to support them if they want to. &nbsp;I actually think that dieting can be very damaging to not just their psyches, but also to their body. &nbsp;There is more and more evidence that dieting actually results in higher body weight in the long run. &nbsp;Not only that, dieting also leads to higher chances of diabetes, higher blood sugar, higher cholesterol. &nbsp;I know this runs counter to what society and even most doctors tell us everyday. &nbsp;It takes a while for evidence to reach mainstream, especially when dieting is a very lucrative industry. &nbsp;I would definitely encourage anyone who is considering dieting, or has a child considering dieting to educate themselves on the subject. &nbsp;There are some great books out there. &nbsp;Of course, it&#39;s up to your child to decide these things, but providing them access to some relevant information is important.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Overcoming-Overeating-Break-Healthier-Satisfying/dp/1456413333/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1387835587&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=overcome+overeating">http://www.amazon.com/Overcoming-Overeating-Break-Healthier-Satisfying/dp/1456413333/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1387835587&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=overcome+overeating</a><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Diet-Myth-Obsessions-Hazardous/dp/159240135X/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1387835614&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=paul+campos">http://www.amazon.com/The-Diet-Myth-Obsessions-Hazardous/dp/159240135X/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1387835614&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=paul+campos</a><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Health-At-Every-Size-Surprising/dp/1935618253/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1387835647&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=health+at+every+size">http://www.amazon.com/Health-At-Every-Size-Surprising/dp/1935618253/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1387835647&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=health+at+every+size</a><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></p></div>
