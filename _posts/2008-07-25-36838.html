<div id="ygrps-yiv-1666438822">I posted about this on my blog but thought that it would make for some<br/>
interesting discussion here too. My daughter is 2 yo and I get to see<br/>
lots of children&#39;s movies lately (even more now that I have embraced<br/>
no limits on TV :-) I really like some of the movies and their<br/>
&quot;messages&quot;. I have even found a couple that really resonate with<br/>
Unschooling and Attachment parenting. It&#39;s both pleasant and a little<br/>
bit surprising. It sometimes feels like &quot;mainstream&quot; ideas are<br/>
everywhere but then you look around and maybe it&#39;s not so true.... <br/>
<br/>
Here are some examples that I have found:<br/>
<br/>
In &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; King Triton, Ariel&#39;s father, tries to control<br/>
her by yelling and forbidding and by punishing (destroying her most<br/>
prized possessions). None of these  methods deter Ariel from exploring<br/>
what she truly desires. In fact they push Ariel farther away from her<br/>
father and into riskier, more dangerous behaviors. So much for<br/>
traditional parenting methods! In the end he concedes that he needs to<br/>
let her grow up and gives her the gift of legs (becoming human) himself.<br/>
<br/>
In &quot;Nemo&quot; (Marisol&#39;s first favorite movie) Marlin, Nemo&#39;s father,<br/>
tries to protect Nemo too much. He wants to keep him in the anenome<br/>
forever. Although this movie may appear to be &quot;pro-school&quot; because<br/>
that is where Nemo wants to be, it is really more about supporting<br/>
your child&#39;s growth and not holding them back. It is ultimately about<br/>
trusting your child because they know what they can and cannot do, and<br/>
also what they want to do - in essence what is best for them.<br/>
<br/>
And my favorite example lately (and the only non-Disney example so far<br/>
) is Curious George. In the movie Ted (the man with the yellow hat)<br/>
undergoes a major personal transformation thanks to George. In the<br/>
beginning of the movie he tells children at the museum he works at,<br/>
&quot;Kids a museum is a place where we observe, we don&#39;t play.&quot; He is the<br/>
ultimate boring teacher. By the conclusion of the movie he has<br/>
completely changed his tune thanks to that crazy little monkey,<br/>
George. As he stands before a huge crowd in front of the renovated<br/>
museum Ted appears to launch into a long boring speech... the crowd,<br/>
especially the children are not happy! Instead, he keeps it short and<br/>
sweet, &quot;I just have one important thing to say. Anyone can memorize<br/>
facts and figures. The real way to learn anything is to go out and<br/>
experience it and let your curiosity lead you - so who&#39;s ready to<br/>
learn?&quot; Man, he sounds like the posterchild for unschooling! I love it!<br/>
<br/>
So where do you see support for a non-mainstream way of living<br/>
slipping into mainstream culture? I&#39;d love to hear of more examples!<br/>

<br/>
My girls love Barbie and the 12 dancing princesses<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0859594/">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0859594/</a><br/>
<br/>
In the movie the girls are loving life until their father&#39;s cousin <br/>
comes to teach them how to be &quot;real princesses&quot;. She takes away all<br/>
the beautiful colors, dresses them in gray and forbids them to sing or<br/>
dance (something they love).<br/>
<br/>
In the end their father realizes it was a mistake to bring his cousin<br/>
there. That they were all &quot;...special, beautiful and you&#39;ll do great<br/>
things in your own way. Just like your mother always told me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Actually all the Barbie movies are great for following connections<br/>
too. There are many actors and actresses that play the same parts in<br/>
all the movies and then there are a few really famous people that show<br/>
up once and awhile like Catherin O&#39;Hara and Kelsey Grammer (who both<br/>
play bad &quot;guys&quot;). I have to admit that the Barbie movies are really<br/>
easy to get &quot;sucked into&quot; when they are on. It even happened to my<br/>
brother and his friends one time (they were like 17 at the time, lol!).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-530376912">This is more anti school than pro unschooling but I was a sullen, <br/>
rebellious and receptive 16 year old when Pink Floyd&#39;s &quot;Another brick <br/>
in the wall&quot; came out. I must have listened to that song a million <br/>
times. I felt like I was waking up to the reality of the controlled <br/>
life I had led and felt to my very core the horror of &quot;thought <br/>
control&quot; and &quot;dark sarcasm&quot; etc. It didn&#39;t occur to me then that <br/>
there was any choice about school, and I didn&#39;t envisage a time when <br/>
I would have my own children but  that was definitely a significant <br/>
time for my future as a radical unschooler. <br/>
<br/>
Interestingly there was a tv programme on recently here (uk) about <br/>
the children who had sung in the original song. Apparently they all <br/>
came from a school in a rough area near to the recording studio. When <br/>
the (maverick) music teacher was approached he happily marched a <br/>
group to the sudios and only later bothered to approach the <br/>
headteacher with a &quot;There is something you need to know &quot;. It took <br/>
the school a looong time to recover itself after the media frenzy.<br/>

I love this book.  The little llama is busy playing and mom scoops him <br/>
up and puts him in the car to go shopping.  She didn&#39;t care that he <br/>
was in the middle of doing something.  Then he falls asleep in the car <br/>
and she wakes him up to go into the store.  After a while he has <br/>
enough and starts throwing things out of the cart.  Then  mama llama <br/>
realized that she&#39;s been pretty rude to him.  She talks to him and <br/>
tries to make it fun.  <br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t about school/unschool, just about respecting your children.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1072291656">I love this song and am really glad that you shared this story. It sounds like an interesting TV show. We used to blare this across the courtyards in college, when it came out. Ah, memories.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up outside of Boston when the city of Newton was experimenting with some ideas that came out of The Sudbury School. My parents wouldn&#39;t buy a house in Newton because of the flaky schools there at the time. Needless to say, it took me a long time to find unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Jae<br/>
<br/>
This is more anti school than pro unschooling but I was a sullen, <br/>
rebellious and receptive 16 year old when Pink Floyd&#39;s &quot;Another brick <br/>
in the wall&quot; came out. I must have listened to that song a million <br/>
times. I felt like I was waking up to the reality of the controlled <br/>
life I had led and felt to my very core the horror of &quot;thought <br/>
control&quot; and &quot;dark sarcasm&quot; etc. It didn&#39;t occur to me then that <br/>
there was any choice about school, and I didn&#39;t envisage a time when <br/>
I would have my own children but . that was definitely a significant <br/>
time for my future as a radical unschooler. <br/>
<br/>
Interestingly there was a tv programme on recently here (uk) about <br/>
the children who had sung in the original song. Apparently they all <br/>
came from a school in a rough area near to the recording studio. When <br/>
the (maverick) music teacher was approached he happily marched a <br/>
group to the sudios and only later bothered to approach the <br/>
headteacher with a &quot;There is something you need to know .&quot;. It took <br/>
the school a looong time to recover itself after the media frenzy.<br/>

To value nature for inspiration and animal observation, to portrait characters or draw from people and learn about ourselves. To find purpose and embrace our talents. To find fun in little things like writing or painting watercolors.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2000232101">I have been reading &quot;ME&quot; Katherine Heprun&#39;s autobiography and her <br/>
childhood was very unschooly.  Her parents were very progressive.  Her <br/>
mom graduated from college in spite of opposition from her uncle who <br/>
was her guardian.  She was involved in women&#39;s rights issues such as <br/>
voting and birth control.  Her dad was a doctor who was very invovled <br/>
in education and prevention of sexually transmitted diseases.  <br/>
<br/>
In describing her childhood  she says they had no rules and tremendous <br/>
freedom.  When people came to her mother about her climbing in trees <br/>
or riding her bike downtown her mother would just smile and say thank <br/>
you.  After her brother died when she was 14 she did not return to <br/>
school.  Her parents let her drive before she had a liscense to get <br/>
around town.  Her dad didn&#39;t approve of her becoming an actress but <br/>
continued to support her financially as well as emotionally anyway.  <br/>
No wonder she was so cool!<br/>
