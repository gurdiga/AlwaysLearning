<div id="ygrps-yiv-1498849034"><html><head></head>Katie Oxford send this and I told her I would send it to a good place. &nbsp;This is a great place! &nbsp;She called it &quot;<span style="font-size:14px;">An unschooling revelation from Ken Jennings&quot;</span><div><br></div><div>Katie wrote:</div><div><br></div><div><div style="margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt;font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;">I was just going through some bookmarked pages in Ken Jenning’s book Braniac, and I found this one set of paragraphs I set aside as something special. He was the guy who won Jeopardy! 74 times in a row, but he wrote this when he was about half-way through his journey and he suddenly realizes, much like we have, that learning can be found all around us. I really enjoyed it, and hoped you would too. I’m not sure if there’s really a place for it on your pages, but now that I’ve typed it all out to save it, I thought it a shame to waste it just keeping it to myself.</div><div style="margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt;font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;"> __________________</div><div style="margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt;font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;"><br></div><div style="margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt;font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;">&quot;Forty-odd games of Jeopardy! have taught me something else about knowledge - namely, that it&#39;s everywhere. I had always assumed that the brains lined up behind the Jeopardy! podiums got all their knowledge from books, from a lifetime of voracious reading. Their sensitive, pallid complexions certainly support that theory. But in my case - and other contestants I talk to have backed me up - reading is secondary (don&#39;t tell your kids). Sure, I like to read. I recognize many answers from things I read in books. But many, many more clues I just remember from a lifetime of general curiosity, of keeping an eye open for what&#39;s going on in the world around me.</div><div style="margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt;font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;"> &nbsp;</div><div style="margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt;font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;">&quot;It&#39;s almost embarrassing how many Jeopardy! answers I give that come not from some highbrow leather-bound reference book but from somewhere a little more plebeian. Should I admit how many mythology questions I knew only because of the Thor comic books I read as a kid, or how many geography questions from globe-trotting reality shows? Almost all my knowledge of stars and constellations comes from bad sci-fi movies. All my national flags come from NBC Olympic coverage. All my aquatic birds come from crossword puzzle clues.</div><div style="margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt;font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;"> &nbsp;</div><div style="margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt;font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;">&quot;It&#39;s encouraging, I guess, to realize how much information we wade through every day, stuff we could absorb if we were engaged enough to notice it. Back at home between tapings, I&#39;m aware for the first time of just how easy it is to learn something new every hour of every day. If I&#39;m watching a few minutes of an old war movie on late-night TV, I&#39;m probably learning something about World War II that I didn&#39;t know before - the only D-Day beach that shares its name with a chemical element (Gold), for example. If I&#39;m flipping through a magazine at the dentist&#39;s office, I might be learning about something new on every page: global warming, or the NBA play-offs, or health-care reform. If I&#39;m cooking dinner with Mindy, I might learn some new word of French or Italian that shows up in the recipe, since those are the languages that I don&#39;t speak - the kind of pasta whose name means &quot;little turnips,&quot; for example. (Ravioli) Even the mindless Thomas the Tank Engine videos that Dylan makes me watch with him, when I pay attention to them, turn out to be a treasure trove of information on trains and railroads. Dozens of times every day, the &quot;Hey, that could come up on Jeopardy!&quot; alarm will go off in my head. It&#39;s not a panicky feeling anymore. Now I sort of enjoy it.&quot;</div><div style="margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt;font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;">__________________</div><div style="margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt;font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;"> &nbsp;</div><div style="margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt;font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;"> &nbsp;</div></div></html></div>
