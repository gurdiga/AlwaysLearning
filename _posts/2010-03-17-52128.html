<div id="ygrps-yiv-2133625131">I repaired those two new list-business files so they&#39;ll open, but I  <br/>
don&#39;t like plain text files.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/files/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/files/</a><br/>
<br/>
One should be going out to new list members, and one should come to  <br/>
the list monthly.<br/>
<br/>
The texts of them are in easier-to-read form here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/lists/alwayslearningNEW">http://sandradodd.com/lists/alwayslearningNEW</a><br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/lists/alwayslearningPOSTS">http://sandradodd.com/lists/alwayslearningPOSTS</a><br/>
<br/>
It seems like overkill, and I know there will still be members who  <br/>
won&#39;t read them or who forget which list they&#39;re on, but I&#39;m still  <br/>
committed to keeping the Always Learning list solid and philosophical,  <br/>
rather than fluffy and scattered.<br/>
