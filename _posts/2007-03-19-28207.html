<div id="ygrps-yiv-1409282287">I have a 9 yr old dd and my question posed to the group is regarding<br/>
her. She is the 2nd of 4 children and quite different in many ways than<br/>
my other 3. In different I mean she has always been somewhat of an<br/>
introvert- very clingy as a baby, nursed for 2 solid years and refused<br/>
solid foods until she weaned, spoke very little until baby # 3 came<br/>
along (she was 2 1/2) and as of the present reads very little and<br/>
struggles to articulate herself. She is finally becoming much more<br/>
verbal with others- so much so it struck me the other day when at a<br/>
restaurant she very bluntly blurted out what her selection for her meal<br/>
was going to be ( I usually order for her). She really is truly a<br/>
beautiful child and very similar, it seems, to my husband. He claims he<br/>
was very much the same as her as a child. She is quite artistic and very<br/>
passionate about whatever she is working on. She frustrates easily<br/>
though when her siblings don&#39;t follow her rules for play and as of<br/>
recently she is very quick to correct and set straight what she sees as<br/>
wrong or bothersome behavior. She seems at times lonely yet I really<br/>
think she is just intensely thinking. My problem is that I tire easily<br/>
trying to listen as she attempts to tell me things and I find it<br/>
difficult at times to be sensitive when she overreacts to situations<br/>
that irritate her. She seems rather immature on some level yet very self<br/>
assured on others. I guess I just need some help understanding her. We<br/>
are so different and I&#39;m not sure what she needs of me. I wonder if she<br/>
feels different than her siblings or other kids her age and if that is<br/>
causing her confusion & insecurity. She realizes reading is a useful<br/>
skill she would like to have, but does not work very hard to build her<br/>
ability up. I suppose it&#39;s just not important to her enough yet, but as<br/>
her 6 yr old sister is advancing and her 5 yr old brother showing much<br/>
interest I&#39;m worried this will cause more frustration for her. Does<br/>
anyone have any suggestions for me in how I should relate to her or help<br/>
her in anyway? Do I continue to stay out of the way or do try to guide<br/>
her a little and how would I do that without insulting her intelligence?<br/>
She really doesn&#39;t want me to &quot;teach&quot; her anything and refuses to listen<br/>
to me whenever my inner teacher shows up!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Rachel</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Rachel it sounds like you have a good understanding of your daughter.<br/>
<br/>
My 18 yo son gave me many questions like yours, more than any of my other<br/>
three did. He was intensely quiet for long periods, and it took me quite a<br/>
while to feel comfortable with that. I thought it indicated that he was in<br/>
discomfort. But really, he was just fine with his reflection and<br/>
thinking...he wasn&#39;t looking for outside help or connection during these<br/>
times. I learned to not &quot;leave him alone&quot;, but to let him be while at the<br/>
same time being watchful for a time that I could supportively say, &quot;hi&quot;.<br/>
That often opened up discussion for us...it wasn&#39;t invasive or intruding in<br/>
his space, but a simple word that was more an invitation if he wanted to<br/>
connect. It was important to not try to get him out of his space, but to<br/>
figure out ways to join in his space...respectfully.<br/>
<br/>
And his long periods of introversion were often followed by explosions of<br/>
activity...it&#39;s just the way his brain worked.<br/>
<br/>
He talked at a later age too...lots of kids do. He still has great<br/>
difficulty expressing his thoughts and feelings, but he writes. He writes<br/>
movie scripts, short stories, poems, etc...writing is a very important part<br/>
of his life. When he was younger, he drew a whole bunch, mostly stick<br/>
figures, because his hands didn&#39;t work all that well with writing or<br/>
drawing, and to this day it is very difficult to read his writing. He types<br/>
really well. He can type about 50 words a minute and he this has been a<br/>
great communication tool for him.<br/>
<br/>
It has always been important for me to be especially vigilant to listen to<br/>
his words, to try to interpret what he is really trying to say. I have been<br/>
a kind of interpreter for him in life...an interpreter of life to him and of<br/>
him to others in life. This has been needed less and less as he has gotten<br/>
older, but certainly was a necessity to get him to where he is today. And<br/>
that is completely okay. It is who he is and what he needed and that is<br/>
unschooling in action.<br/>
<br/>
He too seems &quot;immature&quot; in ways, and yet very insightful in others. This is<br/>
perfectly perfect...our individual children are who they are, and<br/>
unschooling philosophy allows us to see without a second&#39;s thought that<br/>
there is nothing &quot;wrong&quot; with who they are...if they were in public school<br/>
where children are compared with each other, THEN there would be problems<br/>
with our &quot;outside the box&quot; kids. But they really aren&#39;t outside any box,<br/>
there is no box, the box is man-made and imaginary.<br/>
<br/>
It is completely reasonable, in my oh so humble opinion, to trust that your<br/>
daughter does not need your teaching if she does not want your teaching.<br/>
Even though she looks different from your others, she still knows what she<br/>
needs more than you do. She may have more scattered skills than your other<br/>
children, and that is okay. You will need to continue to learn about and<br/>
understand your daughter, probably more consciously than your others, in<br/>
order to truly support her in the ways that she needs. You may need to be<br/>
more a guide to appropriate public behavior for her than you need to be for<br/>
your others, you may need to be ready to show her something new in a<br/>
moment&#39;s notice more so than your others who may give you time and patience<br/>
to gain more information. For instance, my guy once said to me &quot;How do you<br/>
make purple&quot; with great intensity and a desire to know right then. I jumped<br/>
to it more quickly than I would have for my others, because I knew that he<br/>
would lose the moment more quickly than my others would have. Those<br/>
connection times are fewer and farther between with ds than with my other<br/>
kids, who have relationships with me in relaxed ways all the time, and who<br/>
have the capacity to work and live more patiently, who seem to more believe<br/>
that all is well.<br/>
<br/>
So I guess I mostly want to encourage you to continue to know your daughter,<br/>
to be okay with the fact that it is a different-looking path than with your<br/>
other children, and that with that comes lessons that you may not have<br/>
wanted to teach. For instance my 16 yo is driving, my 18 yo won&#39;t be able to<br/>
for a long time it appears. My 18 yo has watched his younger siblings<br/>
accomplish many things, including having healthy friendships, before he did.<br/>
These are tough life lessons to watch as a parent, at least they were for<br/>
me, and my guy has had pain that his sibs probably never will have...but at<br/>
the same he has great insight into things that his sibs don&#39;t have, he is<br/>
intensely creative and sees things that others typically don&#39;t. He has<br/>
opened my mind tremendously...<br/>
<br/>
Keep listening, watching, loving and supporting...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-41443370">Thank you so much, Jackie, for your insightful and kind response to my<br/>
post. I know my DD-9 is amazingly special and i am so blessed to live<br/>
with a person like her, as well a my DH. They both give me  perspective<br/>
on life i would never have on my own and, as a dear friend just told me,<br/>
it balances me.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, I meant by working hard that she doesnt have the drive yet to<br/>
put much energy into it. She tends to back away when it becomes<br/>
difficult & I think that&#39;s OK. I don&#39;t want her to feel unnecessary<br/>
pressure. Reading came very naturally to DD-11 but back then in the<br/>
beginning we &quot;worked&quot; on it a little bit so I suppose the old ghosts<br/>
come back here and there and I wonder if I should have done more with<br/>
DD-9. My Mom, a Montessori teacher, told me once that she (DD-9) lacked<br/>
some basic skills (building blocks) and since then I&#39;ve felt a bit more<br/>
responsible. I will read your article Sandra- thank you.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m using this post as a jumping-off point for a discussion I&#39;ve wanted <br/>
to have with unschoolers for a long time:<br/>
<br/>
How do we unschool kids with learning disabilities/differences, autism, <br/>
dyslexia, sensory integration problems, etc.?  If it&#39;s the school which <br/>
often identifies these problems, and we never send our kids, how do we <br/>
know if they&#39;re just following their own timetable, or if they need <br/>
some kind of intervention?  What happens if we miss a developmental <br/>
window?  Are there truly such things?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve worked on the edges of these issues for a few years now, in my <br/>
capacity as a volunteer with therapeutic horseback riding programs.  <br/>
I&#39;ve talked to lots of parents whose kids suffer in mainstream classes <br/>
or special ed., yet they often find the idea of homeschooling appalling <br/>
because they have enough trouble as it is.  Unschooling is simply <br/>
beyond their capacity to consider, and frankly, I don&#39;t know if it <br/>
would be helpful for their kids.<br/>
<br/>
FYI, I have no idea what, if anything, is &quot;wrong&quot; with the child <br/>
described above, and that&#39;s my point -- the parent who wrote doesn&#39;t, <br/>
either, and has chosen to ask this list.  Can anyone here shed light on <br/>
the problem (other than suggesting we not view our unique children as <br/>
&quot;problems&quot; ;-) ?  Would professional evaluation be helpful to the <br/>
child?  Would that open the door to all kinds of problems, legal or <br/>
otherwise, for the family?<br/>

isn&#39;t long. It also isn&#39;t at all uncommon for younger kids not to  <br/>

didn&#39;t order for herself in restaurants until she was a young teen.  <br/>

frustrated that not everybody shares it. Over time you will help her  <br/>
to learn to decide when it is &quot;worth it&quot; to set others straight and  <br/>
when to be silent. She&#39;ll learn this through trial and error, so  <br/>
you&#39;ll also be there to comfort her when she finds out the hard way  <br/>

behavior.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She seems at times lonely yet I really<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My very-intense middle daughter IS lonely sometimes, yet other times  <br/>
she doesn&#39;t want company because she&#39;s deeply involved in her own  <br/>
stuff. She wants friends who are there when she wants them, but isn&#39;t  <br/>
super good at maintaining friendships because she needs/wants so much  <br/>
alone time, too.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My problem is that I tire easily<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Tire easily? You don&#39;t get to do that - you&#39;re her mom. If you&#39;re  <br/>
tiring &quot;easily&quot; then maybe you need to find a way to have more energy  <br/>
for her.  How tiring can it be to talk with your own child? What do  <br/>
you mean &quot;attempts to tell&quot; you things? Meaning she&#39;s not articulate  <br/>
enough for you to understand what she&#39;s trying to tell you? Then all  <br/>
the conversations you have together are part of what you could  <br/>
consider &quot;speech therapy&quot; and it is, if anything, even MORE important  <br/>
that you listen patiently, reflect back to her what you do  <br/>
understand, help her phrase things when you can, etc. If you&#39;re  <br/>
letting on that you&#39;re impatient, then you could be creating a  <br/>
problem of her feeling pressured and that&#39;s likely to make her less  <br/>
articulate, not help her express herself more easily.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and I find it<br/>
&gt; difficult at times to be sensitive when she overreacts to situations<br/>
&gt; that irritate her.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I truly understand. HOW many times I&#39;ve thought (and occasionally and  <br/>
regrettably said aloud to her) that my daughter is overreacting. I  <br/>
remember we were sitting around a campfire with lots of other people  <br/>
and playing a game and my daughter quietly &quot;called out&quot; an answer and  <br/>
someone else heard and they called it out louder. They were heard and  <br/>
got the &quot;credit&quot; for her answer. She was really upset about how it  <br/>
wasn&#39;t fair. She was about 9 years old, by the way. I was embarrassed  <br/>
and made things far worse by trying to shush her. She got more and  <br/>
more upset and I had to take her away from the group and she sobbed  <br/>
and sobbed. I was frustrated and told her she was acting like it was  <br/>
the end of the world. She sobbed more and got angry with me, too.  <br/>
Things escalated until I took her back to our tent and the evening  <br/>
was over for us. I was mad that she&#39;d wrecked MY night and she was  <br/>
humiliated and angry. This kind of scenario repeated a number of  <br/>
times over the years. Looking back, I know NOW that what I should  <br/>
have done was take her very seriously - she was totally right and the  <br/>
person should NOT have taken credit for her answer. It was cheating  <br/>
and unfair and it mattered tremendously to her 9 year old self. She  <br/>
didn&#39;t care about the rest of the world, ending or not &lt;G&gt;. I should  <br/>
have commiserated and comforted and maybe even spoken up and said,  <br/>
&quot;Just for the record, that last answer was first given by Roxana.&quot;  <br/>
SHE would have seen that as me standing up for what was right. Who  <br/>
cares if other adults would have thought it was making a mountain out  <br/>
of a molehill? Knowing what I know now, I realize made many mistakes  <br/>
of this type - trivializing what was really super important to her.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She seems rather immature on some level yet very self<br/>
&gt; assured on others.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She is who she is - so what she needs is you to accept that. Learn  <br/>
from my experience and don&#39;t expect her to &quot;act&quot; mature all the time  <br/>
or to have mature considerations or understanding.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I guess I just need some help understanding her. We<br/>
&gt; are so different and I&#39;m not sure what she needs of me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Probably for you to listen to her more willingly and eagerly and  <br/>
patiently (without showing that you&#39;re being patient). I know my  <br/>
middle daughter needed me to &quot;be there&quot; for her when she was ready to  <br/>
talk, even more than my other kids did. And it was easy for me to  <br/>
unintentionally blow her off because if I didn&#39;t appear to be eager/ <br/>
willing, she&#39;d just drop it and I&#39;d miss an opportunity to connect  <br/>
with her.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I wonder if she<br/>
&gt; feels different than her siblings or other kids her age and if that is<br/>
&gt; causing her confusion & insecurity.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Of course she feels different.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She realizes reading is a useful<br/>
&gt; skill she would like to have, but does not work very hard to build her<br/>
&gt; ability up.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Does she think that she needs to do that in order to learn to read?  <br/>
If I was you, I&#39;d be sure to toss around ideas about multiple  <br/>
intelligences - in words she can understand. What she needs is to be  <br/>
aware that children develop different skills at different ages as  <br/>
their brains and nervous systems develop differently. She has  <br/>
developed some ability to think deeply about justice and morality and  <br/>
ethics. Lots of kids haven&#39;t got that ability at her age. And her  <br/>
artistic abilities are developing before her language abilities and  <br/>
that&#39;s great - every person is unique and this is how she is. When it  <br/>
is natural to do so, point out how so-and-so has natural physical  <br/>
ability and so-and-so has natural singing ability and how someone  <br/>
else has natural reading ability - all learning things, all  <br/>
developing at their own speeds in their own directions. What an  <br/>
adventure it IS to grow and find out what her own special strengths  <br/>
will be. Don&#39;t let her think learning to read requires that SHE work  <br/>
at it - it really just requires that her brain be developed in  <br/>
certain areas. Commiserate if she says it is hard to wait, but also  <br/>
point out that she can listen to books as much as she wants, no need  <br/>
to wait to be able to read them for herself, right? If she wants to  <br/>
be more well-read, get her audible books on an mp3 player to listen  <br/>
to on her own.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I suppose it&#39;s just not important to her enough yet,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yikes. Have you told her that she&#39;ll be able to learn when it is  <br/>
important enough to her? So now she feels like it is her own laziness  <br/>
that is keeping her from reading? You owe her an apology, in that  <br/>
case, because that is SO not true.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but as<br/>
&gt; her 6 yr old sister is advancing and her 5 yr old brother showing much<br/>
&gt; interest I&#39;m worried this will cause more frustration for her.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It could - but get her lots of books to listen to so that she can  <br/>
have the chance to have &quot;read&quot; books before they did and she can  <br/>
recommend books to them, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Does<br/>
&gt; anyone have any suggestions for me in how I should relate to her or  <br/>
&gt; help<br/>
&gt; her in anyway? Do I continue to stay out of the way<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Stay out of her way?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; or do try to guide<br/>
&gt; her a little and how would I do that without insulting her  <br/>
&gt; intelligence?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What would offering ideas and suggestions and support be insulting to  <br/>
her intelligence? I don&#39;t understand.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She really doesn&#39;t want me to &quot;teach&quot; her anything and refuses to  <br/>
&gt; listen<br/>
&gt; to me whenever my inner teacher shows up!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Relate her learning to read with her learning to walk. How did you  <br/>
help? Was it fun? Was she embarrassed that she wasn&#39;t yet walking?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d bet that you make her feel ashamed of herself for not learning  <br/>
better. Maybe ponder that for a while and it&#39;ll help you figure out  <br/>
what to do instead.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2088186482">Hello :)<br/>
<br/>
Well this topic inspires me to philisophically rambling questions...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;how do we know if they&#39;re just following their own timetable, or if <br/>
they need some kind of intervention?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Am I alone in the idea that our (what&#39;s the word here? society? <br/>
culture? country? I&#39;m not sure) requires, demands even, a status <br/>
quo?  Creating a &quot;which one of these things isn&#39;t like the other?&quot; <br/>
situation that makes devleopmental differences &quot;special&quot; in that bad <br/>
way?  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know except the older my child gets the more I see him grow <br/>
and develop in institutionally measurable and human immesurable ways <br/>
and the more I am truly humbled.  Having never been institutionally <br/>
anything&#39;d by any sort of expert it makes me wonder, maybe their <br/>
whole school of &quot;mainstream&quot; thougth a myth?<br/>
<br/>
Admitedly though, I wouldn&#39;t know because he is just a &quot;normal&quot; kid.  <br/>
Isn&#39;t he? I certainly think so but then again, I never thought to <br/>
consult an expert when he challenged me to grow as a mother and <br/>
person.  <br/>
<br/>
Again, just rambling thoughts, wondering what other RUN families <br/>
think.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;(other than suggesting we not view our unique children <br/>
as &quot;problems&quot; ;-)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Oops, read that too late! Please forgive me, I&#39;ve already typed this <br/>
and hoped for an answer :)<br/>
<br/>
Blessings,<br/>

Sandra&#39;s list. She owns it.  If the point is that Sandra &quot;rules&quot; the  <br/>
list, then yeah, well, that&#39;s what being &quot;list owner&quot; means. Starting  <br/>
a list is easy - you can start your own with a few mouse clicks.  <br/>
Sandra will even put your list on her website to advertise it for  <br/>
you, if you want.<br/>
