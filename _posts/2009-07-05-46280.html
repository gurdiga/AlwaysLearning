<br/>
Meredith is creating and organizing these.  The current batch  <br/>
(collected in June) contains:<br/>
==================<br/>
<br/>
Travels and Journeys of the mind<br/>
<br/>
Gillian leads us off with a whole blogful of travels:<br/>

<br/>
Ren takes us to visit her grandparents farm and a journey into her past:<br/>

Amy Dingmann relates her 550 mile motorcycle trip to her unschooling  <br/>
life:<br/>

If you haven&#39;t had enough, here&#39;s a page that lists some other  <br/>
unschoolers&#39; blogs you can peruse:<br/>

=======================<br/>
(end of the quote, back to this post)<br/>
<br/>
=======================<br/>
I&#39;m listing them here because there are a couple of formatting  <br/>
glitches on the site itself, but the collection is cool.<br/>
<br/>
These blog carnivals are a good way to get a cross-section of some  <br/>
different blogs and writings that you might have missed.  I enjoy them  <br/>
because they&#39;re a mix of people I know and people I don&#39;t, but writing  <br/>
about similar topics.<br/>
<br/>
The real site for it is here, and it doesn&#39;t require special writing  <br/>
but can be a post you&#39;ve already written.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://familyrun.ning.com/forum/topics/here-we-go-julys-blog-carnival">http://familyrun.ning.com/forum/topics/here-we-go-julys-blog-carnival</a><br/>
<br/>
I will probably be too busy to think about it later in the month, so  <br/>
if some of you here could remind people around Learn Nothing Day to  <br/>
consider  sending links to applicable posts there, I&#39;d appreciate it.<br/>

It&#39;s funny that this came up because I just wrote a blog post about learning nothing.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://peaceondarknights.blogspot.com/2009/06/dont-learn-anything-today.html">http://peaceondarknights.blogspot.com/2009/06/dont-learn-anything-today.html</a><br/>

I&#39;m looking forward to reading all those blog posts tomorrow.<br/>
