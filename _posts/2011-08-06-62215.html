Ren Allen found this somewhere somehow, and it&#39;s an interesting read from ten years ago, from Unschooling.com&#39;s message board, which was long ago dismantled.<br/>
<br/>
The page that opens is the last page.  You can use the links at the top to start at the beginning, but you&#39;ll need to go back to the last page to get to each next link (because there&#39;s no &quot;next&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
For people who wonder whether and how much people end up being changed by unschooling, or whether they can unschool just a little bit, some of the ideas in there might be... enlightening!  <br/>

Maybe a different computer or a different time of day?  It loads right up for me; sorry I don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
The interesting thing about it for Ren was how much her beliefs have changed since she wrote there.   There&#39;s other evidence of Ren&#39;s change of perspective in this TV discussion: <br/>
<br/>
Oh wait.  This is a good intro:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-183496155">Thank you for this post...I feel soooo relieved and validated.  Most of our<br/>
peers are &quot;all natural&quot; and either no tv or very little tv...i have not<br/>
limited my child&#39;s tv watching and feel chatised sometimes because of<br/>
it....but she is so bright at almost 4 years of age and she learns best by<br/>
playing computer games and interactive tv shows like blues clues, ni hao kai<br/>
lan, dora, diego, crashbox(on HBO)...etc, etc....we spend time reading and<br/>
writing and drawing and coloring too, but I must admit I like kai lan and<br/>
dora too...jajajjaja<br/>
Thank you<br/>
sincerely<br/>

<br/>
For me, learning was always the tipping point, when my kids were little, especially.<br/>
<br/>
If I couldn&#39;t decide between two things, I went with the thing from which they would learn something new.<br/>
<br/>
Those who are &quot;all natural&quot; are not thinking very clearly *AT ALL.*  There are arguments against the printed word; it kept people from needing to remember important information, prevented the need for memorization, and took the sacred importance away from books worth writing out by hand.<br/>
<br/>
There have been arguments against comic books, paperback books, secular books (and secular music, still, in many quarters)...   <br/>
<br/>
Arguments against information, against experience, against involvement in the world as it is THIS YEAR, not 100 years ago, are bad arguments.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-459564686">Renee, my son that was on that video reading to his younger sister used to love to watch TV when he was a toddler and he loves video games. He learned to read playing the online game Roblox.<br/>
He was reading fluently at around 6 and a half.<br/>
He is 9 now and is a  great kid.<br/>
He still loves playing games but just a little while ago he wanted to know if his dad was going to go running so he could go ride his bike on the trail with him. They have started doing that and he loves to go ride his bike when dad runs. They did not go tonight but they went outside and played basketball. <br/>
 I have never limited his TV, video game playing or computer. He actually has all the newer computer  systems, a TV with satellite in his room plus his computer. <br/>
With all that he plays a  lot of pretend with his sister and even reads her a book once in a while  like in the video.<br/>
He comes to me a lot to tell me about his games and videos and ideas he has. He is a very cool kid.<br/>
