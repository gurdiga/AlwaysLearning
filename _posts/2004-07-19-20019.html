<br/>
10. Well normally yes, but this time of year I need help with the planting <br/>
and plowing.<br/>
<br/>
9. Goodness, no!!! I graduated 18 years ago, but thanks for the compliment!<br/>
<br/>
8. No, we homeschool. We&#39;re just out to pick up a bag of pork rinds and some <br/>
Mountain Dew, then we gotta hurry home to catch our soaps.<br/>
<br/>
7. What?! Where did you guys come from?! Oh my gosh! I thought I told you <br/>
kids to stay at school! I&#39;m sorry. This happens all the time. (sigh)<br/>
<br/>
6. There isn&#39;t? Why, you&#39;d think we would have seen more kids out then, don&#39;t <br/>
you?<br/>
<br/>
5. We&#39;re on a field trip studying human nature&#39;s intrusive and assumptive <br/>
tactics of displaying ignorance and implied superiority. Thanks for the peek!<br/>
<br/>
4. On our planet we have different methods of education. (Shhh! No, I didn&#39;t <br/>
give it away... keep your antennae down!)<br/>
<br/>
3. Oh my goodness! I thought that today was Saturday...come on kids, hurry!<br/>
<br/>
2. Noooooope.Me &#39;n Bubba jes&#39; learns &#39;em at home. Werks reel good!<br/>
