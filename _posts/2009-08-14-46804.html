 </span></blockquote>&quot;Unschooling&quot; seems to be very much an American term. <br/>
<br/>
In Australia, homeschooling is usually called &quot;home education&quot;. My<br/>
local network, the Home Education Network of Canberra and the<br/>
Southern Tablelands (HENCAST), has on its website, &quot;We have members<br/>
(registered and not) from all walks of life with varying beliefs who<br/>
are home educating their children in a variety of ways.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That includes what people here would recognise as &quot;unschooling&quot; but<br/>
it isn&#39;t specifically named.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;The video was really interesting.. I realized that, because I hated structured, formal school, all I ever learned was what I taught myself! For instance when I went to the stock exchange I hadn&#39;t the faintest clue what fractions and decimals really meant, so I worked them out and pretty soon was able to calculate in a flash what for instance, 18/32 was in decimals, (0.5625) to make prices.. my old maths master would have been stunned because I never ever passed a maths exam!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My dad left school early and went on to become a very successful stock broker, but insisted on very strict, formal education for his kids. Clearly he is still willing to learn and grow, and is now completely supportive of my choice to unschool mine. This revelation of his is really making me smile today.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1179130144">The professor in the interview, Dr Alan Thomas, is co-author of a book called &quot;How Children Learn at Home&quot;, which is an academic study of autonomous learning / unschooling based on interviews with British, Irish and Australian families.  I read it about a year ago and thoroughly recommend it.  As you can see from the interview he is very positive about autonomous learning.  I found it fascinating and it could also be handy when dealing with sceptical family members etc.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-284496752">Hi Joy,<br/>
I think you might be referring to his 2000 book, which was an academic sort of study rather than his newer 2008 book. This is how Amazon describes them.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In his &quot;Educating Children at Home&quot; (2000), Alan Thomas found that many home educating families chose or gravitated towards an informal style of education, radically different from that found in schools. Such learning, also described as unschooling, natural or autonomous, takes place without most of the features considered essential for learning in school. At home there is no curriculum or sequential teaching, nor are there any lessons, textbooks, requirements for written work, practice exercises, marking or testing. But how can children who learn in this way actually achieve an education on a par with what schools offer? In this new research, Alan Thomas and Harriet Pattison seek to explain the efficacy of this alternative pedagogy through the experiences of families who have chosen to educate their children informally.Based on interviews and extended examples of learning at home the authors explore: the scope for informal learning within children&#39;s everyday lives; the informal acquisition of literacy and numeracy; the role of parents and others in informal learning; and, how children proactively develop their own learning agendas. Their investigation provides not only an insight into the powerful and effective nature of informal learning but also presents some fundamental challenges to many of the assumptions underpinning educational theory. This book will be of interest to education practitioners, researchers and all parents, whether their children are in or out of school, offering as it does fascinating insights into the nature of children&#39;s learning.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The reason I want to make the distinction is because the newer one is much more him exploring how informal learning works as opposed to having just discovered that people do it. And it is a much more readable book rather than an academic tome.<br/>
<br/>
I heard Alan Thomas interviewed here in the UK and the interviewer was asking many of the usual questions, in a mildly aggressive &#39;yeah but&#39; tone of voice and Alan Thomas very sweetly continued to answer the questions and reiterate how amazing it all is and then blew me away when he said he wished he&#39;d known about it when his kids were young. Now that is what I like to hear on my radio.<br/>
