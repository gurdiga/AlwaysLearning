<div id="ygrps-yiv-324654975">We used to rotate who got to choose to sit where in the van.  The kids helped keep track of whose turn it was.  <br/>
<br/>
Other things we often used rock/paper/scissors.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes if I just asked &quot;Who got to do it first last time?&quot; they would switch out and let the other one go first.<br/>
<br/>
If that doesn&#39;t work with yours, maybe you could keep a chart for a while with tic marks for who goes first  how many times, not in any kind of shaming or training way, but just so they can see that it&#39;s even and fair, or that it&#39;s too one-sided.  It might be a tool to help them figure out a way to decide.<br/>

<br/>
Since the kids are happy with it right now, it&#39;s a good solution For Now. Probably you&#39;ll find it doesn&#39;t work for everything, or doesn&#39;t work for very long, or it&#39;s something you do for awhile and drop and pick up again later... a lot of problem solving with kids looks like that. There aren&#39;t &quot;once and for all solutions&quot; because kids grow and change and circumstances change, too. <br/>
<br/>
If they both like being &quot;first&quot; right now, if it&#39;s fun for them, it might help to look for ways to play with that - actively look for ways they can each be first in different ways. That might be tricky if it tends to lead to hurt feelings! That&#39;s going to depend on your kids&#39; personalities.<br/>

<br/>
How is this different from being mindful? <br/>
I think helping children think before speaking or acting, and thinking of two options and making a choice is great, and the parents can be doing that too.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=But really, the gift comes in asking the child.<br/>

<br/>
That sounds pretty, but I don&#39;t think it covers the situation of a child feeling he&#39;s not getting equal opportunities.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;The answer&quot; suggests there is one anser, but it&#39;s good when a family has  range of tools and ideas instead of looking for a single one.  Situations and factors differ, and kids get older.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;When we ask instead of tell&quot; sets up a dichotomy similar to &quot;parent led / child led.&quot;  <br/>
Making a suggestion is neither asking nor telling.<br/>
<br/>
And in stressful situations, a younger child might agree to lots of things to have peace or to be accommodating when he might really rather negotiate a while longer, or hear some more ideas.  The answer can&#39;t always come if the child doesn&#39;t have answers.  And sometimes &quot;the answer&quot; that comes is a politely worded surrender, and the older child, or pushier child, or quickest child &quot;wins&quot; again.  <br/>

Sounds like a great idea. I wonder if it might also help to play with it  I<br/>
think I read about this in Playful Parenting  start begging to go second<br/>
or go last or whatever, or join in with wanting to go first, make a<br/>
ridiculous and funny game out of it. It might help diffuse some of the power<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One of the things that has really helped us with “me first” is giving ourselves lots and lots of time to do things. Giving ourselves more time to negotiate these situations is immensely helpful. Also, I try to anticipate potential me first situations and ask ahead of time “Who wants to go first?” That way, we have it worked out before we ever get to the door or the car. With the car, we each have our own spots. It worked out that way because of the car seats. Each person’s spot has her stuff in it so that there is no need to argue about who is going to sit where. Sometimes, I will step in and advocate for the child that doesn’t get to go first as much. Yesterday, my 8 year old wanted to go inside first so she asked her little sister, “Is it okay if I go in first this time?” and her little sister said it was fine. I try to help them be mindful of each other and take turns. In order to do that, I have to build in lots of extra time and take things slowly. Me firsts are a lot harder to navigate when you are in a hurry and pressed for time. One of the other things that I have done is do-overs. When leaving, we can take turns being out the door first. Another possibility is encouraging them to hold hands so that they can all be first together. I don’t rely on any one solution but have several options so that I can assess the situation and make suggestions accordingly. <br/>

I&#39;ll bite! -- Because I&#39;m now pretty curious of how you saw so many advanages to being a &quot;last&quot; child... I was a &quot;first&quot; (and I can speak to some disadvantages of that, lol) I can imagine some obvious advantages to being last (or youngest) but not enough to make a mile long list (or even a full page).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to read your experience list of why last was best in your eyes growing up. That&#39;s a fun idea and I might learn to see something in a new way. Thanks!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>*****************<br/>
<br/>
Really? When a couple of little kids are allllll excited about something you stop them, make them set aside their joy and enthusiasm, and give them a lesson in first/last? Ouch. That&#39;s not much different than saying &quot;no-one gets to be first until you all behave&quot; especially for any child who doesn&#39;t do well with that sort of talky lessoning. It&#39;s a heartbreaking response to childish enthusiasm.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; First, it difuses any power-play or competition hanging in the air.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, it establishes the teacher firmly in the position of power and the lesson as more important than the desires and feelings of children. No-one gets to do Anything until everyone gives the proper responses. And that has never once been shown to diminish competition, ever. It just happens behind the teacher&#39;s back or mom&#39;s back, and the pecking order is determined with only the skills possessed by very young children: as soon as mom turns her back, you&#39;re going down. It doesn&#39;t help kids learn to work things out or solve problems - it shows them very, very clearly that the Last person they want to share their interpersonal problems with is the teacher.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Second, it can move us toward &quot;svadyaya&quot; a yoga term for learning about self through looking inward<br/>
 </span></blockquote>****************<br/>
<br/>
Only if the students choose to look inward - and if they&#39;re trying to find the &quot;right answer&quot; so they can get back to what&#39;s really important to them (who gets to sit by the window?) they&#39;re not looking inward at all. <br/>
<br/>
This is one of the great fallacies of teaching - that teaching creates learning. It doesn&#39;t. Sometimes people will choose to learn from teachers.<br/>
<br/>
This is something my brother wrote on Facebook recently on the subject of reading, but it could just as easily apply to teaching kids to &quot;look inward&quot; (or anything else):<br/>
<br/>
&quot;&quot;Often I did &quot;hate to read&quot;. The goal in school, was to read x number of pages per day or finish the book and write something about it before I could do something else. That made reading the obstacle to the real goal, &quot;Do something else&quot;. It was a chore.<br/>
 <br/>
When I found really interesting stuff, I&#39;d piss my teachers off. My 6th grade poetry reading of The Cremation of Sam McGee was less than well received due to subject matter. I ruined lesson plans by doing things like reading ahead and knowing how the story turns out, having memorized The Jabberwocky when the task for the day is unscrambling the jumbled lines, killing an hour long discussion about what does the book tile mean by pointing out Beelzebub is Hebrew for Lord of the Flys, etc. I was a problem whether I was being an underachiever or exceeding expectations. Failed AP English...5 on the AP exam.<br/>
 <br/>
It took me a while before I enjoyed reading. That wasn&#39;t until I did it for my own reasons instead of merely following a syllabus.&quot;&quot;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But really, the gift comes in asking the child.<br/>
&gt; When we ask instead of tell, the answer always comes.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Communication is important. The biggest mistake adults make in communicating with children is thinking it&#39;s about talking - asking or telling. Start sooner and further back: listen, watch, notice patterns and tendencies. Kids communicate in a hundred different ways that don&#39;t involve words. One of the advantages of unschooling is that you have time for the quiet, observational parts of communication. You get to learn about your kids without asking or telling. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes asking is useful, but when a child answers &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; or gives you a blank look, that&#39;s Not telling you he or she wants a lesson. A lot of the time it means you&#39;re asking the wrong question and need to step back, look and listen some more. Sometimes, in the moment when you don&#39;t know what to do and your child doesn&#39;t either, it&#39;s okay to guess and try something and see what happens - that&#39;s part of learning, too!<br/>

<br/>
Common preferences is *a* good strategy for sharing space. It&#39;s not the only one. While it makes your life easier to end the bickering quickly, what&#39;s more useful for them in the long run is seeing problem solving in action. If peace is always to goal, it can mean needs and wants become secondary. What will be most helpful through out their lives are finding ways they can get what they want AND take others into consideration. It&#39;s a complex problem to solve and kids need to see it in action a lot.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree. I think a lot of parents enforce fairness when they don&#39;t have a clear idea what they mean. Fair often means equal which often isn&#39;t fair! Some people need more, some less. Equal&#39;s just easy. It&#39;s hard for a kid to argue with equal.

<br/>
That&#39;s why that AND is important. It acknowledges that the child&#39;s need is important AND something else too. And the goal is to figure out how to get both.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1225469485">Hello everyone, <br/>
<br/>
I have been reading this for years now & never replied.  I just wanted to add a little bit of something that was helpful for me <br/>
in working with the issue of fairness with my two children 5 & 8.  We also have moments where “it’s not fair” comes up.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to remind my children that what is FAIR is that we all get our needs met as best as we can & that often means we don’t get the<br/>
exact same turn/treatment/food/experience etc.  This will not likely work with the super young ones, but for us it cultivates that <br/>
practice of recognizing our individuality and taking care of ourselves. While also recognizing that someone else&#39;s needs are often different different then <br/>
our own.  <br/>
<br/>
One practice we have used also is to take a moment to reflect at the end of the day and ask, “What is one way you took care of yourself today?”  AND “How <br/>
have you helped someone else today?”  <br/>
<br/>
It might also be interesting to see how you do this in your adult life, at the bank, in line at the grocery store, etc.  Nothing I say to my <br/>
children speaks as loudly as what they see me doing.  <br/>
