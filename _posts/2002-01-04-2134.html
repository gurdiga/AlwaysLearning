<div id="ygrps-yiv-793665471">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Finally finished the 80 some-odd digests I was behind on since our trip.<br/>
Got to meet Sharon of the Swamp.  She is a very neat lady with a wonderful<br/>
porch (I&#39;m tempted to run away from home and move in to that fantastic<br/>
porch).  Got to play &quot;slammer-jammer&quot; with Roy which involves throwing metal<br/>
buckets off his very high tree house and enjoying the rattle and cacophony<br/>
they make on the way down.<br/>
<br/>
After a 21 hour car ride and a week with my loving but tremendously<br/>
controlling mil, Sharon&#39;s place was a delight of relaxation and good fun.<br/>
My kids haven&#39;t stopped talking about it......They say to count us in for<br/>
May, Sharon.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This sounds wonderful.  Those big screened-in porches are one fascination of <br/>
southern houses.  They just don&#39;t do that in New Mexico.  Neat porches here <br/>
are ramadas--just a shady jutting out of the roof, and some don&#39;t even have <br/>
rain-proof roofs.  Screenwire just hardly made it here.  We got barbed <br/>
wire... &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Today I get to meet (and pick up from the airport and host...)<br/>
<br/>
[drumroll, please]<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Joyce Fetteroll !!!<br/>
<br/>
She and her daughter will be here this afternoon, and for four whole days <br/>
(not counting the travel days which are small parts of days on my end and <br/>
LONG (three flights) on theirs.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s interesting being so scattered out.  Someday maybe there will be so many <br/>
more unschoolers it won&#39;t be worth this interstate visitation.   And we&#39;ll <br/>
tell stories like &quot;In the old days we&#39;d drive five states away...&quot; or &quot;Fly <br/>
2000 miles&quot; to meet a family we had met online because we really wanted to <br/>
see how other unschoolers interacted.  <br/>
<br/>
But New Mexico&#39;s pretty cool to see even if someone has all other resources <br/>
right at home.  It&#39;s hard to describe WHY it&#39;s worth coming here, but I&#39;ve <br/>
never heard anyone say &quot;Yeah, I went there, but it was nothing special or <br/>
different.&quot;  (Maybe they just don&#39;t say it to me! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

My Aunt fell in love with the place, and bought a condo in Santa Fe <br/>
about 10 yrs ago.<br/>
She&#39;s back and forth from Baltimore all the time.  My parents go with <br/>
her a couple of times a year now.  Indian  market, and a hot air <br/>
balloon fest every year.  <br/>
I&#39;ve been there once.<br/>
When dh and I camped across country before marraige and family, we <br/>
had the lucky misfortune of breaking down in Taos.  It was the week <br/>
before xmas and we were staying at the Sungod Lodge(one of the few <br/>
times we got a hotel).  We were stuck there 4 days(over the weekend <br/>
waiting for our car to be fixed) and were running out of money.  We <br/>
asked the lady at the lodge if there was anything we could do to earn <br/>
our keep, and she started finding odd jobs for us.  We decorated a 40 <br/>
ft. tree out front with lights.<br/>
My dh mentioned to her, he could do plumbing, and they just happened <br/>
to need and had the supplies for changing out all the bathroom <br/>
fixtures in every room.<br/>
In the end, it didn&#39;t cost us a dime to stay there and she made us <br/>
dinner a couple of nights(she lived in an apt. behind the front <br/>
office.)<br/>
It was a magical time for us.  That whole trip was magical, but Taos <br/>
will always have a special place in our hearts.  We are going to take <br/>
the kids there someday.  <br/>
We ended up living in Boulder, CO that winter.  That&#39;s another pretty <br/>
cool place. <br/>

definately feeling like I&#39;m home)</div>

 </span></blockquote>We lived in Boulder for 10 years and loved it. It&#39;s changed a lot though, <br/>
even in the time we were living there. It&#39;s still pretty cool, but corporate <br/>
America is slowly sneaking in. (Actually, it&#39;s being welcomed with open <br/>
arms.) And the city is up to almost 100,000 people! I stil miss it, though.<br/>

That&#39;s a really cool story.  <br/>
I grew up in Espanola, and Taos always seemed kinda spooky to me. &lt;g&gt;</div>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve really enjoyed my visits to New Mexico and I definitely want to see<br/>
more!   On our last visit we went to Santa Fe before Megan was born.  I<br/>
had to take it easy since I live at sea level.  The more interesting <br/>
pueblos were too high in elevation to visit (I was late second trimester).<br/>
But there&#39;s a lot just in Santa Fe!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking of a trip that direction this year.  We&#39;ll see what <br/>
happens - right now I have a cranky husband who is working to meet a major <br/>
deadline and he doesn&#39;t like to discuss what to do after he&#39;s done!  If<br/>
we could visit during some SCA event, that would be cool.  I like to<br/>
see how things are done in other kingdoms!<br/>

<br/>
We drove from Indiana back to California in April last<br/>
year. We went through NM and I loved it. Two of the<br/>
places that we went through, that I seriously<br/>
considered as a place to live (we were still looking<br/>
at that point), was northern NM and northern AZ.  I so<br/>
wish I had known about all of you then. We could have<br/>
gotten some great visits in. Oh well, we&#39;ll just have<br/>
to do another road trip sometime (maybe this spring,<br/>
on our way to and from Florida?)!<br/>
