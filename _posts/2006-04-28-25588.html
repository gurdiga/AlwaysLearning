<div id="ygrps-yiv-608886001">I lived in England for two years when I was a child,I have really fond <br/>
memories of that period of my life.When Nick was younger,even now he <br/>
was involved in a lot of sports.Here in Montreal most boys go through<br/>
(never leave) a hockey phase.He has always been involved in many <br/>
sports,softball soccer,hockey...so coming home later would never be an <br/>
issue since either his father or I would be a the games,or he would <br/>
come home with friends.It was the sudden shift between the ages of 15-<br/>
16,where I was feeling something akin to fear.I was questioning his <br/>
choice in friends and the places he chose to go to.I felt that he <br/>
might not be prepared for stuff that I was imagining could happen<br/>
(Montreal is a relatively safe city).This was when the friction reared <br/>
it&#39;s ugly head.We prepared him well for life though he was and still <br/>
is a smart,independent young man.As for the &quot;kids just hanging out&quot; in <br/>
my experience they are often the children who are hurt or injured <br/>
emotionally,not always but often(I know this because I was one of <br/>
them).Bridget</div>
