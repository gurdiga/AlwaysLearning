<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Do you have brush that needs cutting down? My girls (I know the youngest<br/>
 </span></blockquote>was 7, the older would have been about 9 at the time) Really enjoyed cutting<br/>
brush with a machete when we were cleaning up our yard. &lt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Our 12 year old son did a scything course and we bought him a beautiful<br/>
Austrian scythe which is his pride and joy. He cuts grass for our horses and<br/>
he is always polishing or peening or sharpening his blade. He can tell you<br/>
all the reasons why scything is good for body and soul, and also why the<br/>
Austrian scythe is better than other scythes too.. with huge enthusiasm.<br/>
<br/>
Has he cut himself yet? Yes! Ended up at A&E for a few hours to get his<br/>
thumb fixed up. He can explain in detail what went wrong and what he did and<br/>
how it won&#39;t happen again. Part of the learning..<br/>
