<div id="ygrps-yiv-1448550648">Holly knows the difference between everyday (an adjective) and every  <br/>
day (an adverbial phrase) but she doesn&#39;t know that latter term, I  <br/>
don&#39;t think.  She knows if you&#39;re telling what kind of thing (an  <br/>
everyday dress or an everyday occurrence) it&#39;s one word, and if  <br/>
you&#39;re telling when you do it, you might do so every day).   That&#39;s  <br/>
something being lost among the 30-somethings of the world.  But  <br/>
English changes.  It always has.  Victorian grammar books tried to  <br/>
put the brakes on it, but it&#39;s too large an omnibus even for those  <br/>
19th century Brits who were *sure* their culture was the highest and  <br/>
best possible expression of mankind.    Others bought into their self- <br/>
satisfaction, though, too, and STILL kids are pressed to read  <br/>
Treasure Island as a classic piece of literature.<br/>
<br/>
*************************************<br/>
<br/>
I wrote that in another thread but I pulled it out to start a new trail.<br/>
<br/>
*************************************<br/>
<br/>
Even with grammar, there is history and culture and geography.  (With  <br/>
everything there is everything, and with every single topic can come  <br/>
every other topic.)<br/>
<br/>
England in the late 19th century was pretty damned proud of itself  <br/>
and Victoria was &quot;By the Grace of God, Queen of the United Kingdom of  <br/>
Great Britain and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, Empress of  <br/>
India.&quot;   She had some other titles too, but no matter.   If they  <br/>
were the greatest power ever (as they were quite sure they were),  <br/>
then their language and culture must be the big IT.   So Australia  <br/>
and New Zealand and Canada and even the U.S. tended to want to keep  <br/>
up with or be up on the in crowd with English as it should be, I  <br/>
think, and that all happened with books.<br/>
<br/>
Reading Dickens was cool because he wrote sometimes in other  <br/>
dialects, but it was clear that the narrator was the &quot;right&quot;  <br/>
dialect.   Mark Twain was doing some of the same in the U.S. a little  <br/>
later.<br/>
<br/>
We (all English-speaking countries) would have drifted much further  <br/>
apart linguistically had it not been for radio, TV and movies.<br/>
<br/>
So I think the Victorians and the state of the economy and  the  <br/>
industrial age making paper production and printing less expensive  <br/>
and whatever all advances were involved with linotype machines and  <br/>
all that--it was a way to solidify language.   MANY people thought  <br/>
this was good, and good enough, and English should be and stay  <br/>
codified.   It was like damming up a river, though.  You can&#39;t keep  <br/>
ALL the water in.<br/>
<br/>
There is a balance, a tension, between conservatism and radicalism,  <br/>
between &quot;stop&quot; and &quot;go,&quot; between<br/>
TIME OUT.   I was talking to Kirby the other day by phone about using  <br/>
semi-colons to punctuate series sometimes, and this is one of those  <br/>
times I&#39;m going to, but before I take that sentence and revise it  <br/>
(not study it for a test, as &quot;revise&quot; means in England, but change  <br/>
it) I&#39;m going to say that I need to send this to Kirby now, because I  <br/>
didn&#39;t have a reason then to tell him that although commas usually go  <br/>
inside quotes, semi-colons never do.<br/>
<br/>
Backing up and going again:<br/>
<br/>
There is a balance, a tension, between conservatism and radicalism;  <br/>
between &quot;stop&quot; and &quot;go&quot;; between tradition and slang.   That  <br/>
compromise is what makes things grow at a pace people can follow.   <br/>
Some people don&#39;t want a single &quot;rule&quot; to change.  Some want ALL the  <br/>
rules to change.  And so some of the rules change.<br/>

P.S.  I wrote &quot;STILL kids are pressed to read Treasure Island as a  <br/>
classic piece of literature.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Treasure Island is fine, but the writing is archaic and the sentences  <br/>
are L-o-n-g and it takes forever to get to action.  At the time it  <br/>
was new, it was like Star Wars or Raiders of the Lost Ark.   In an  <br/>
age when kids can play video games where they can make decisions to  <br/>
change the action, Treasure Island is an antique.  It inspired some  <br/>
really great illustrations.  It almost single-handedly fuels &quot;talk  <br/>
like a pirate day.&quot;</div>
