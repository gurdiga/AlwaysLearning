<h4>Nichole, ubiquitous</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-484929890">This weekend Shahram and I spent a lot of time going over our financial situation and setting up a budget.  Margaux heard most of our discussion.Late Saturday night, she came to me asking how much her gameboy recharger costs per month when it&#39;s not being used.  I know that there is some flow of energy happening in everything even when it&#39;s not turned on.  I didn&#39;t find the information on that yet, but we found this.  There&#39;s a great list of home appliances and how much they cost to operate.  You just fill in the amount of days they are in use, or the hours, and it shows you how much you&#39;re paying.  This is very cool.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-638852257">That was cool.  I went through and filled out the table and it came out to<br/>
just about what our monthly electric bill totals.  The things that surprised<br/>
me were how cheap it is to wash and dry clothes  (I won&#39;t need to feel<br/>
guilty when I don&#39;t hang them out anymore.) and how expensive it is to run<br/>
ceiling fans and window fans.  I guess I&#39;ll shut them off more often when<br/>
they aren&#39;t in use.  I don&#39;t know why, but I figured ceiling fans didn&#39;t use<br/>
much electricity.  Thanks for the neat site.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-730177811">It&#39;s called &quot;phantom load&quot; (the energy applicances use when not &quot;on&quot;).<br/>
 Remember how long televisions used to take to &quot;turn on&quot;?  They now<br/>
carry a phantom load to keep them ready to turn on instantly.<br/>
