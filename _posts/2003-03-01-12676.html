<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Riley is 6. When he gets frustrated he grabs, kicks, screams, pouts. He is<br/>
&gt; sensitive and can get his feelings hurt or think people are rude or mean.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;ve got the wrong name in this sentence.  It should say, &quot;Tim is 6.<br/>
When....&quot;   You&#39;ve just described my son perfectly.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s partly about being 6, and just like the annoying stages of 2<br/>
and 3, it&#39;ll go away.  I also think it&#39;s a lot about this time of year.<br/>
It&#39;s finally starting to occur to me (I&#39;m a slow learner!) that we often<br/>
have most of our problems in late winter, before spring starts and all the<br/>
fun stuff Tim loves best.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t do park days, because there aren&#39;t enough homeschoolers here who<br/>
feel that they can leave their curriculum for 2 hours a week to have a park<br/>
day.  So I can&#39;t tell you what I&#39;d do.  But I hope it&#39;s slightly reassuring<br/>
to know that your son sounds perfectly normal to me!<br/>
