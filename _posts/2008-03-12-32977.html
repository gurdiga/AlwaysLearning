<div id="ygrps-yiv-543020242">I woke up this morning wondering why my 9 year was locked in his room<br/>
making a lot of noises with Lego&#39;s.  I could hear the pouring and<br/>
organizing.  :-)  He usually wakes up and parks himself in front of<br/>
his computer and an animation program.  (www.aniboom.com  Really cool<br/>
and FREE BTW)<br/>
<br/>
About 30 minutes later, he comes down the stairs and asks me if I<br/>
noticed his &quot;chores list&quot;.  Then he brings me to look.  I feel asleep<br/>
early last night (ahhh... pregnancy) and apparently my husband and S.<br/>
made this list together.  We have not required or asked any &quot;chores&quot;<br/>
or cleaning of him for a very long time.  I don&#39;t know who initiated<br/>
it.  I don&#39;t know any details other than the fact that it was there<br/>
this morning, he seemed happy, and he had proudly cleaned his room.  S<br/>
presented this to me this morning and said &quot;I was thinking  I could<br/>
get about 4 bucks a week, every Saturday, for this.&quot; I&#39;m pretty sure<br/>
he came up with his own dollar amount.  He said he wanted 2 dollars to<br/>
save, and 2 dollars to spend.  ( wants to open a bank account for his<br/>
savings!  COOL!)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we chatted, and I chatted with my husband and we all came to<br/>
the conclusion that &quot;YES, definitely.  4 dollars every Saturday is<br/>
your allowance.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
So... here&#39;s my questions.  <br/>
     - should I ask my husband who&#39;s idea it was?  does it matter how<br/>
it was handled.  I&#39;m not suspecting any coercion and he seems really<br/>
independent and content with his proposition.<br/>
<br/>
     - if he decided NOT to do the list he made, which he inevitably<br/>
will (LOL) how should this work?  I don&#39;t think his allowance should<br/>
be contingent on whether he completes chores or not.  But I feel that<br/>
he has made a commitment to us.  Maybe I should help him honor that,<br/>
by helping him complete his list?  or reworking his list?  or should I<br/>
just stay out of it and give him 4 dollars every saturday as promised?<br/>
<br/>
     -what if he drops the list altogether.  I don&#39;t mind.  I just<br/>
want to be able to say the right words to him I guess.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.  This is my first allowance! :-)  i never got<br/>
allowance as a kid.  Even if I did I&#39;m pretty sure it would have been<br/>
handled very poorly.  LOL</div>

<br/>
Maybe before the deal falls apart (if it looks like it&#39;s going to)  <br/>
you and your husband could initiate a renegotiation, so it comes from  <br/>
you and not your son.  Maybe you could say &quot;We think it&#39;s great that  <br/>
you want to do these things, but you should only do them because you  <br/>
want to,  not for money.  And we think you should have more than $4,  <br/>
so we&#39;re going to give you (whatever... $6--something more) a week.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Those are my first thoughts on it.<br/>
<br/>
Night before last Holly went to the grocery store and spent some of  <br/>
her own money on food she wanted.  It was food I would&#39;ve been  <br/>
totally willing to buy for her.  She could&#39;ve just put it on the  <br/>

They learned to take care of money by having money and spending it  <br/>
(sometimes unwisely) and saving it (sometimes for very cool  <br/>
things).   Kids who don&#39;t have money when they&#39;re little do their  <br/>

Better to practice with small amounts.<br/>

what he&#39;s wanting/needing.  I&#39;m liking that he&#39;s asking for his own<br/>
money.  I&#39;m happy to give it to him.  He&#39;s been doing a lot of growing<br/>
lately.  :-)  I&#39;ve seen a lot of changes in him.  <br/>
<br/>
(He picked up his first book the other day and read it cover to cover.<br/>
 Then went for book 2 the next day and read that one cover to cover! <br/>
Very exciting!  He used to love to read and Kindergarten took the joy<br/>
right out of it!  I&#39;m glad he&#39;s enjoying it again!)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1858651102">Z gets $8 a week (one dollar for every year he is old) and gets a raise <br/>
on his birthdays (right around the time DH gets his annual raise lol). <br/>
<br/>
His allowance is not contingent on his helping around the house. He <br/>
does have &quot;chores&quot; but they are things we usually do together. DH <br/>
wanted the weekly allowance to be contingent on weekly chores but how <br/>
could it? I have a strong aversion to doing weekly chores! LOL<br/>
<br/>
But basically he gets an allowance cuz everyone deserves some spending <br/>
cash (he usually has more than me!) and we all pitch in around the <br/>
house to some extent cuz we all deserve a (somewhat) clean house.<br/>
<br/>
However, we all reserve the right to say &quot;Chores suck, let&#39;s skip <br/>
them!&quot; LOL It&#39;s great how we&#39;re all on the same page on that one. haha<br/>

I agree.  Your hubby may have thought it was your sons idea but your son<br/>
may have felt some (even unintentional) coercion.  I know my ds often<br/>
does things cause he thinks it&#39;ll make someone else happy.  Which is<br/>
nice but it&#39;s not always about what he wants then.<br/>

&gt; would&#39;ve been carried by the people he went with and stayed with, but<br/>

&gt; gasoline.  I have no doubt that Marty brought back any unspent<br/>
&gt; money.  I don&#39;t ask anymore.  He always has.<br/>
<br/>
We too have always given the kids their own $$ to do with as they chose<br/>
(allowance), it goes up  as they get older.    A few weeks ago my<br/>
daughter (10) was at a cheerleading competition and staying with some<br/>
other team mates in a hotel (I was there, but not in the same room). <br/>
Sometimes they&#39;d go off and get dinner as a team or do some stuff just<br/>
as a team.  I gave her x amount of dollars and she said &quot;I brought my<br/>
own $$ money, you don&#39;t need to give me this.&quot;  I told her I would like<br/>
to pay for her dinner and snacks or whatever and she should save/ spend<br/>
her $$ on things she&#39;d like.  On the way home she gave me the unspent<br/>
$$.   I told her to keep it.  Then we stopped for food and I was a<br/>
little short so she gave me $$$.<br/>
<br/>
To be honest I&#39;m kinda surprised by this behavior because it looks<br/>
nothing like anything I would have done as a 10 year old (heck , even as<br/>
a 20 yo) .   As a kid there would never be any unspent $$, if I had it,<br/>
I felt the need to spend it.  Yikes!!<br/>
<br/>
I was actually surprised at how many parents actually had the coaches<br/>
hold the girls money.    Same thing happened at girl scout camp, I<br/>
overheard a parent telling a counselor that she wanted the counselor to<br/>
hold her daughters $$ cause all she&#39;s do is buy junk.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;Kids who don&#39;t have money when they&#39;re little do their<br/>
&lt;practicing with larger amounts, sometimes with serious consequences.<br/>
&lt;Better to practice with small amounts.<br/>
<br/>
Exactly what I was thinking!!<br/>

<br/>
It surprised me, too.  I never stole from my parents, but I had  <br/>
friends who did.  They&#39;d go into their dad&#39;s wallet or their mom&#39;s  <br/>
purse or the &quot;cookie jar&quot; (whatever change stash there was) regularly.<br/>
<br/>
Since our kids were little, if they wanted their allowance, Keith has  <br/>
been able to say &quot;My wallet&#39;s on my desk,&quot; and between the wallet and  <br/>
the change bowl, they would get exactly their allowance.<br/>
<br/>
I wrote this years ago: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/spoiled">http://sandradodd.com/spoiled</a><br/>
<br/>
It ends with this: -=-&quot;You can&#39;t give what you don&#39;t have,&quot; some  <br/>
people say, and if you want your children to give generosity and  <br/>
kindness and patience to others, you should give them so much they&#39;re  <br/>
overflowing with it.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Holly dog-sat last weekend.  She said &quot;I like feeding Ben&#39;s dogs  <br/>
better than Sadie&#39;s, because they food&#39;s still measured, but they  <br/>
give them more of it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Everywhere my kids have fed dogs (I&#39;m thinking of four houses, people  <br/>
I know in all), the dogs are fed by the clock and by the measure.   <br/>
The dogs are rambunctious and knock each other and people away to get  <br/>
to the food, and they beg and bug people all the time between times.   <br/>
They&#39;re hungry.  They&#39;re needy.<br/>
<br/>
Our dog was at the vet a few months back, for the first time in  <br/>
years.  The vet did the routine thing, and asked what she was eating,  <br/>
and Keith said &quot;table scraps, some of her food, some of the cats&#39;  <br/>
food; whatever she wants.&quot;  The vet was stunned and had no follow-up  <br/>
speech.  Our dog&#39;s not the least bit fat, and she&#39;s ten years old  <br/>
this season,  and running around fine.  It seemed from what Keith was  <br/>
saying that the vet figured there must be something wrong with her  <br/>
for her not to be fat, if she had unlimited food.<br/>
<br/>
Not only does Gudrun let the cats come up and eat what&#39;s been put  <br/>
down for her (she knows they&#39;ll never finish it), and the cats let  <br/>
her eat from their bowls, but when we have visiting dogs, Gudrun will  <br/>
let them eat too.  She&#39;ll chase dogs away from the front of the house  <br/>
if they&#39;re out there, but if we let them in the house and tell her  <br/>
it&#39;s okay, she doesn&#39;t growl about her food.  I think it&#39;s because  <br/>
she knows if the bowl&#39;s empty we&#39;ll put some more down.  She eats  <br/>
dry, and sometimes cooking- or table-scraps, and she loves cheese (so  <br/>
we grate a little too much each time and let her have some) and  <br/>
peanut butter) so stale bread or leftover pancakes become peanut  <br/>
butter sandwiches for her, which we break into little pieces.<br/>
<br/>
Someone said once &quot;So we&#39;re unschooling our dogs now?&quot;  I don&#39;t think  <br/>
it&#39;s unschooling, and I don&#39;t really think of what we&#39;re doing with  <br/>
the kids at such levels to be unschooling either.  I think it&#39;s  <br/>
living naturally--paying attention to what people want and need, and  <br/>
keeping them from being desperately needy or frustrated.  It has  <br/>
worked with our dog too, and the cats.  The yard isn&#39;t fenced.  They  <br/>
can take off when and if they want to.  They don&#39;t want to.  They  <br/>
have it good here, and we&#39;re nice to them.<br/>
<br/>
Even without comparing their own lives to other people their age, our  <br/>
kids have taken a lesson in behavior and psychology from feeding  <br/>
other people&#39;s dogs and comparing all that to our pets.<br/>
<br/>
Questions about allowance can be recast as &quot;What will you provide?   <br/>
What choices can others make when they HAVE a choice?<br/>
<br/>
If a dog knows he has to eat fast and defensively or go hungry, he&#39;ll  <br/>
eat fast and defensively.<br/>
<br/>
If a dog knows there will be more food there when she&#39;s hungry, she  <br/>
only eats when she&#39;s hungry.<br/>

<br/>
My 12 yo son would want someone else in charge.  He&#39;s never cared much about money <br/>
and whenever there is money of his involved he always asks me or his dad to keep it for <br/>
him so it doesn&#39;t get lost.  We haven&#39;t even gone down the allowance road really, because <br/>
he doesn&#39;t really care and my 9 yo dd hasn&#39;t yet either--I find her money all over the <br/>
house, used in play or sometimes just forgotten.  I keep looking for signs that they would <br/>
like to have their own money for spending, but it just hasn&#39;t come up yet....<br/>
<br/>
My son did get some christmas money and gift cards that he has enjoyed spending, but he <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to keep track of it or think about it--he just wants a total amount translated <br/>
into Wii controllers or games.  :-)<br/>

Kirby used to keep track of his allowance on the calendar instead of  <br/>
claiming it.  He would do bookkeeping right there in public, so if he  <br/>
took money out of his balance he&#39;d debit that, and each week he would  <br/>
up the balance.  We dreaded the day when it would be several months  <br/>
in and he&#39;d cash out.  Ouch!   But it was banking we didn&#39;t teach him  <br/>
or foist on him.  It was his idea.<br/>

There&#39;s a world of difference between choosing to entrust someone  <br/>
with your money and having someone else say &quot;You can&#39;t hold your own  <br/>
money.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We always had a family master list of things to get when we could.  <br/>
THAT was one of the best things we ever did - making that list. We had  <br/>
lots of conversation about what should be at the top of the list and  <br/>
lots of good discussion about trade-offs.  Realistically, we couldn&#39;t  <br/>
just always buy everything immediately. So it was really good for all  <br/>
of us to look at the list and see things like, &quot;Well, if I bought  <br/>
these three new games, that would be over a hundred dollars, so if I  <br/>
don&#39;t buy the games, I could put that toward the new game system,  <br/>
instead.&quot; It is REALLY hard for kids (and lots of adults) to think of  <br/>
buying things in terms of what they&#39;re giving up - but that is the  <br/>
REAL cost and the relevant information for making good decisions that  <br/>
we end up happy with.<br/>
<br/>
I remember how surprised and gratified I was to hear the kids saying  <br/>
we should get something for their dad or me or one of their siblings,  <br/>
even when it meant a delay in getting what they wanted. They took into  <br/>
account how MUCH someone else would enjoy something or how much they  <br/>
needed it.<br/>
<br/>
Roya was the most impulsive spender in our family - but now she&#39;s 23  <br/>
and has a full-time career and is 100% responsible for herself. She  <br/>
just bought a car, she has health insurance, she is paying off her own  <br/>
student loan and she had a performance review at her job this week and  <br/>
they gave her a 6% raise! She&#39;s careful with her money and she saves  <br/>
some out of every paycheck.<br/>
<br/>
Roxana is now 20 - about 3 years ago I gave her an atm card for my  <br/>
regular bank account - so she has total access to our checking and  <br/>
savings and credit card. I also got her a credit card in her own name.  <br/>
I never worry that she&#39;s going to take out too much - if she needs a  <br/>
lot, she brings it up in advance. She has been involved in theater and  <br/>
often goes out to eat after rehearsals or shows and she can always get  <br/>
cash if she needs it. She takes college classes and can get cash for  <br/>
lunch money or to pay for books or supplies. Sometimes she gets a  <br/>
little extra cash to offer to pay for gas when she has friends driving  <br/>
her here and there. She doesn&#39;t take the money and spend it  <br/>
frivolously - she&#39;s careful with it. Rox is in France now and living  <br/>
on her own in an apartment - I don&#39;t worry about her going nuts and  <br/>
overspending. In fact, I have to remind her that this is a big giant  <br/>
life-changing experience and it is okay to splurge (she didn&#39;t go to  <br/>
EuroDisney because we live right by Disneyland - been there a million  <br/>
times - and she thought EuroDisney was too expensive).<br/>
<br/>
Rosie is the same way - she&#39;s now 17, and she has her own money  <br/>
because she gets paid to teach martial arts classes. But she&#39;s careful  <br/>
with it - not foolish. She&#39;s saved up about $1400 for a trip to New  <br/>
York City (taking the train from Southern California to NYC, staying  <br/>
there a week, taking the train back home - ANYBODY with any possible  <br/>
leads on affordable places to stay for 7 people in Manhattan - please  <br/>
contact me offlist).<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; them to handle money - they learned by handling it  <br/>
at whatever level they could. We did give them about $50 per month,  <br/>
once they were in their early teens, specifically for buying their own  <br/>
clothes and for gifts for friends. Interestingly, they&#39;d still ask for  <br/>
my opinion about their clothes, but - it was THEIR money and that made  <br/>
a difference in my attitude. II wasn&#39;t my decision whether it was  <br/>
worth buying or not worth buying.<br/>
<br/>
When they were even littler, we&#39;d give them money to spend that day.  <br/>
If we went to Disneyland, we might give them each $10 and say, &quot;That&#39;s  <br/>
pretty much the money we can afford for treats or souvenirs for  <br/>
today.&quot; If they wanted something, they&#39;d spend it. Sometimes they  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t spend it. OFTEN they pooled their money to get something.  <br/>
Sometimes one would give some of hers to a sister who really wanted  <br/>
something too expensive. Sometimes I&#39;d see that there was something  <br/>
they wanted that they couldn&#39;t afford and I&#39;d buy it as a gift for  <br/>
them, maybe for later. Anyway, all kinds of possibilities - we weren&#39;t  <br/>
rigid about this. But it was nice for them to have their own money as  <br/>
often as possible, I think, because it made their decision &quot;theirs&quot;  <br/>
and my dh and I didn&#39;t feel any ownership of their spending decisions.<br/>

I remember as a kid feeling like a beggar or whiner and then being  <br/>
told &quot;no&quot; a lot.  Although it was pre-70&#39;s inflation, my allowance as  <br/>
a kid was 35 cents and in college $5.  So I got an on-campus student  <br/>
job pretty quickly.<br/>
<br/>
When my allowance was 35 cents, candy bars were five cents (Mounds  <br/>
and Almost joy were ten cents) and penny candy was still freely  <br/>
available.  Decent bubble gum was available for a penny.   Paperback  <br/>
books were 50 cents.<br/>
<br/>
My kids&#39; allowance has started when they were 5 or 6, and was 75  <br/>
cents per year of age per week.  Holly still gets allowance.  $12 a  <br/>
week, this year.   She babysits sometimes too, for money.  She&#39;s fed  <br/>
dogs and she housesat in the past month.<br/>
<br/>
When she was five she got $3.75 and things she wanted were often $5  <br/>
or $10, so she saved, and happily!<br/>
<br/>
We have offered to lend Kirby money, when he started talking about  <br/>
moving to Texas.  He borrowed *once,* when their deposits were due  <br/>
before their first paychecks came.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m very happy with my children&#39;s money sense.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday they were going to go play laser tag.  I went and got cash  <br/>
to give them (out-of-town homeschoolers wanted them to meet them to  <br/>
play, so I figured I didn&#39;t mind paying for it, especially since I  <br/>
was opting out to stay home and cook for my Wednesday night get- <br/>
together).  Marty still had $40 of the $50 Keith had given him for  <br/>
last weekend, so they used that.<br/>
<br/>
Before they left, Marty came and printed out coupons for the place.   <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t have thought of that.  So he printed out enough for them  <br/>
and the other family too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1991805184">I don&#39;t have a page about allowances (yet!) but I found these bits to  <br/>
bring for consideration in this discussion.<br/>
<br/>
**************<br/>
<br/>
On how children will make choices about how to spend money (Joyce  <br/>
Fetteroll, then Pam Sorooshian):<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s the common thought that if they&#39;re &quot;indulged&quot; they&#39;ll never  <br/>
understand the value of money. But with my daughter that didn&#39;t prove  <br/>
true and I don&#39;t think the common thought has any basis. It&#39;s just fear.<br/>
<br/>
Joyce<br/>
RIGHT!<br/>
It is a left-over idea that children won&#39;t learn what we don&#39;t  <br/>
directly teach them. We know that&#39;s not true. They WANT to be  <br/>
competent and capable and they will want to live good lives in which  <br/>
they will think about what makes sense to get what they want and do  <br/>
what they want. it is once again a matter of trust—trusting that  <br/>
they&#39;ll &quot;grow up&quot; and that if we don&#39;t mess with them, if we don&#39;t  <br/>
warp them in some way, they&#39;ll make conscious decisions about money.<br/>
NO different than food issues at all —if we keep at them about what  <br/>
they eat or don&#39;t eat—if we bug them all the time, if we say, &quot;You  <br/>
can eat anything you want, but, oh, honey, do you really want to eat  <br/>
just cake for breakfast, don&#39;t you think you should have some eggs?&quot;  <br/>
then we undermine their own sense of self, their own sense of making  <br/>
their own choices, their own chance to make their own &quot;little&quot;  <br/>
mistakes. Their eating, as adults, will STILL be somehow controlled  <br/>
by that controlling mommy voice in our heads—and, as teens and  <br/>
adults, we very often tend to be resistant to it—which means that we  <br/>
find ourselves as ADULTS, eating too much cake while hearing, &quot;You  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t be eating that,&quot; over and over in our heads.<br/>
Do we want our kids to grow up and find themselves spending money on  <br/>
the adult equivalent of junky little things while hearing, &quot;You  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t be buying that,&quot; over and over in their heads?<br/>
Trust them.<br/>
Be their support system. I want so much for my kids to grow up and  <br/>
hear that mommy voice in their head saying positive supportive  <br/>
things, not tearing them down, but encouraging them - and especially  <br/>
not a voice to be resisted. This drives me. I don&#39;t do it all that  <br/>
well - but what I focus on is awareness of what they&#39;re likely  <br/>
hearing/saying to themselves in response to what I&#39;m saying out loud.<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;I never stole from my parents, but I had <br/>
friends who  did. They&#39;d go into their dad&#39;s wallet or their mom&#39;s <br/>
purse or the &quot;cookie  jar&quot; (whatever change stash there was)  regularly.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I did-twice. Once was from my mom&#39;s purse, $2 that was visible in the open  <br/>
zipper. My mother had told me since I could remember, &quot;Don&#39;t ever steal. If you <br/>
 need money, ASK me.&quot; Problem was, when I *did* ask, I got asked in return <br/>
what  it was for and I don&#39;t ever remember anything being &quot;valid&quot; enough in her <br/>
realm  of reasoning to say yes. I asked and asked but the answer was always, <br/>
&quot;No.&quot; So,  I made my own &quot;yes&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
The second was the stash of change my dad had in his wardrobe. I was  <br/>
young-ish (11?). Definitely inexperienced and unaware of many things-I was  <br/>
&quot;sheltered&quot;. Those dusty old coins in jars and bowls in his wardrobe just sat  there <br/>
getting older and dustier. In my realm of understanding at the time, old  and <br/>
dusty meant less worth. So, when I wanted some candy one day (candy was  <br/>
definitely forbidden except for special occasions), I dug out a dollar or two&#39;s  <br/>
worth of dimes and nickels and took them to our local store in our small town.  My <br/>
mom&#39;s friend was a cashier there and asked my mom later on if we had gone to  <br/>
Canada on vacation and my thievery was discovered. My mother explained while <br/>
she  yelled at me that my dad had collected those coins over the years and <br/>
that they  were OLD (and from the way she said it, I understood that old coins <br/>
had  value-more value than new coins! Go figure...) and that he&#39;d collected some <br/>
of  those coins from places he&#39;d been while he was onboard his aircraft <br/>
carrier in  the Navy and that he&#39;d been saving them for years to pass down to his <br/>
son. My  dad built a wooden box in the bottom of that wardrobe with a padlock <br/>
on it and  it stayed locked until I inherited the wardrobe after they built <br/>
closets in  their bedroom. That box broke my heart. Everytime I looked at my <br/>
dad&#39;s wardrobe,  it was a reminder. After it was explained to me the value, both <br/>
investment-wise  *and* sentimental-wise, I would never have taken that money <br/>
again, so to top it  off with a locked box for the coins made me feel worse than <br/>
the label of thief.  It meant to me that my dear dad thought I didn&#39;t care <br/>
about his feelings-which  was certainly not true! And 30+ years later, my <br/>
parents still think of me as  untrustworthy. A thief. For $4 or less. For two <br/>
instances as a kid. Funny how  money has so much unseen value and so much weight in <br/>
our society... <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1697217992">Both of our kids (11 yo. and 6 yo.) get an &quot;allowance&quot; of $10 each week.  There are no expectations or &quot;chores&quot; attached to their &quot;allowance.&quot;  It is never taken away as punishment (as we don&#39;t believe in punishment, something that we continue to work on-LOL).  We believe that it is given for being part of the family.  Plus, our kids do help out when asked (though, we ask with no expectation, so if they say &quot;no,&quot; that&#39;s fine).  <br/>
<br/>
However, the 6 yo. adores money and wants more every day.  She asked if she did many things around the house (i.e. clean the fridge, etc.) could she get more money.  I told her that there were other ways she could make money, such as through selling her old toys or clothes on ebay or making jewelry or other things to sell at our local farmer&#39;s market or on ebay.  I really don&#39;t feel comfortable paying her for individual jobs that are contributions to the family.  We tried it once and she asked to be paid for everything, from picking a piece of paper off the floor to cleaning the toilet.  I feel that her &quot;allowance&quot; covers these things, whether she does them or not.<br/>

We used to &quot;gamble.&quot;  It was a trivia game, played with the kids&#39; own  <br/>
change and my change jar.  I&#39;d get those sets of cards with a rivet  <br/>
through one end that had trivia questions at school-grade levels and  <br/>
there were variations on the play, but I wouldn&#39;t usually ask  <br/>
questions one of them didn&#39;t know the answer to.  If I did, it was  <br/>
because the answer would be interesting for some reason.   Sometimes  <br/>
we would have the globe there, in case of country or ocean or  <br/>
continent questions, but it went quickly.<br/>
<br/>
We always did it up on my bed, sitting in a circle.  I would ask a  <br/>
question and if the kid whose turn it was knew, I&#39;d throw a penny at  <br/>
his bowl or whatever he had brought to the bed to hold his money.  If  <br/>
it was easy and he knew but missed, he would throw me a penny.   If  <br/>
the kid just didn&#39;t know, the question would pass to the next kid.  It  <br/>
was always exciting if the boys missed and Holly knew.  Sometimes I  <br/>
would start with Holly.  Sometimes it was a rotation, and sometimes I  <br/>
would name the kid I was aiming the question at (probably the one who  <br/>
hadn&#39;t won a penny in the past few turns).<br/>
<br/>
If the answer was really good, they&#39;d get two pennies.  If the  <br/>
question was flawed and the answer involved pointing out that flaw,  <br/>
I&#39;d give them two or three, or a nickel.<br/>
<br/>
We played it for fun and funny, and it was usually Kirby&#39;s idea.  Or  <br/>
if they were bored, or if Kirby wanted to go down and buy collectible  <br/>
cards from the card shop around the corner, that sold them  <br/>
individually, and that had used action figures and such.   As soon as  <br/>
it was boring, we quit, so sometimes it was a five or ten minute  <br/>
session, and sometimes it went longer.<br/>
<br/>
I would try to add something sometimes, like if it was spelling and  <br/>
the spelling was tricky and I knew the history of that word, I&#39;d say a  <br/>
tiny little bit, to clarify.   If it was where a country was or an  <br/>
ocean, I might say &quot;near Greece&quot; or &quot;right on the equator&quot; or something.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t &quot;allowance&quot; and it was never much money, but it was fun, and  <br/>
it was a way I got to know some of the things they knew that they  <br/>
hadn&#39;t been taught, and it gave the younger kids an opportunity to  <br/>
show Kirby up a little (which wasn&#39;t easy in those days).<br/>
<br/>
Holly probably doesn&#39;t even remember it, because we never played it  <br/>
after we moved and they had their own rooms and weren&#39;t so crowded and  <br/>
needful of cheering up.  My bed wasn&#39;t the gathering place after they  <br/>
had their own rooms.  At the old house, they all shared one room.<br/>
<br/>
Another idea is maybe she would like a video game that &quot;collects gold&quot;  <br/>
or coins or points.  Neopets or something.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1407178937">I agree, Pam.  I&#39;m stressed about money.  Unfortunately my husband just took a pretty significant pay cut (though he&#39;s leaving a job he has hated for the last 10 years and has really caused a lot of stress in and out of the home, so it&#39;s a good thing, too - LOL).  So, we are working out the new budget and are feeling stressed right now.  I know once we&#39;ve been at it a few months, we&#39;ll feel better.  <br/>
<br/>
I also admit that my dh and I have always had negative issues around money, so Lily is definitely bringing up some old stuff in us that we haven&#39;t figured out how to work through, yet.  She just loves money - LOL.  She spends her days counting coins to see if she can get a dollar or two (her favorite is &quot;I&#39;ll give you 3 quarters for a dollar.&quot; and she knows all too well that there are 4 quarters in a dollar - LOL).  She also has free access to one of our extra coin jars, to dig around in for extra money.  I know a lot of this does have to do with me and my dh working out our money issues and with our recent cut in salary, so over time things should get better.  Just can&#39;t see the forest through the trees right now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2083343052">This is long, but it&#39;s about how Andrew&#39;s allowance has changed over the years, including the most recent change that happened today when I had an &quot;aha!&quot; moment.<br/>
<br/>
Andrew, who&#39;s 11, has been getting an allowance since age 4. We started off doing a weekly allowance equivalent to his age, and did that for four or five years. <br/>
<br/>
Once he really got into video games, saving a weekly allowance until he had enough money to buy one game was frustrating for him, so he asked to start receiving his allowance monthly. Around that same time, we started giving him a flat $50/month -- that generally covered any game purchases he wanted in a month&#39;s time. If he and I were both interested in the same game, then we&#39;d split the cost of it.<br/>
<br/>
A year and a half ago, Andrew discovered the Xbox 360. Those games tend to run $59.99 new, but most of the time the $50/month allowance worked just fine because he&#39;d plan ahead for upcoming games and budget accordingly -- sometimes Rodney and I would buy a game for him when we could, and my mom and other relatives here always give cash or gift cards to Andrew for birthdays and Christmas so that he can buy games he wants.<br/>
<br/>
But in the last month or two, I&#39;ve noticed his allowance just isn&#39;t jiving with his gaming wants. He&#39;s become more and more interested in older games, some of which can be downloaded onto the Xbox or Wii or PS2, some of which can be found used on Amazon or Ebay, most of which aren&#39;t available to rent. He reads and watches online reviews, then researches online to see if the games can be found and how much they cost -- he&#39;s being thoughtful about what he wants. He loves comparing these old games to each other and to newer versions, and writing his own reviews of them, and making video playthroughs (to post on YouTube) for them.<br/>
<br/>
Last night we were at the video game store and he was looking through a gaming guide. I offered to buy it for him because he has the game that corresponds to it rented right now, with the intent to buy the game when he can. He was kind of glum and said he didn&#39;t know when he&#39;d be able to buy the game because it&#39;s $59.99 -- if he used May&#39;s allowance + the $10 he has left this month, he can get the game at the first of May, but then he wouldn&#39;t have money left to buy another game until June. It wasn&#39;t a &quot;poor me&quot; kind of thing at all; he was simply bummed that if he bought the game, he wouldn&#39;t have allowance to buy another game until June. I told him that I&#39;d split the cost of the game with him in May, so that he would still be able to buy downloadable games or whatever, and that cheered him up.<br/>
<br/>
Then, in the shower this morning, I had one of those &quot;Duh! Why didn&#39;t I think of this sooner???&quot; thoughts. I realized that it&#39;s time to adjust his allowance so that it better meets his needs. I talked with my husband about it and we agreed to double Andrew&#39;s allowance. I know some parents would freak about the idea of a $100/month allowance -- in fact, my hubby and I both freaked a little about it ourselves [g]. But when we put it into perspective, we agreed that it&#39;s something we can afford to do right now, so we will. <br/>
<br/>
Some of the things we considered that helped us put it into perspective:<br/>
<br/>
~ Other than the cost of Xbox Live, this is really the only consistent monthly expense we have for Andrew. At the end of March, Andrew opted to drop out of the acting class he was taking because he wasn&#39;t enjoying it. That class was $45/month, so freeing that up offsets the increase in allowance (we didn&#39;t present it to Andrew that way, but for budgeting purposes it helped Rodney and I to keep this in mind). <br/>
<br/>
~ If Andrew was in school, there would be expenses related to that, and his allowance would be above and beyond those expenses. We don&#39;t have school-related expenses, so why not adjust his allowance to reflect that.<br/>
<br/>
~ Andrew has never had expectations that we would buy things for him that exceeded his allowance. Sometimes we offer to -- sometimes he accepts those offers, other times he doesn&#39;t. For the past five-ish years, he&#39;s been very thoughtful with his allowance, planning ahead and budgeting for the things he&#39;s wanted to buy with it -- in fact, I&#39;ve commented to him many times that he&#39;s been a good example for me in that respect, and it&#39;s true! While some people would say he&#39;s spoiled for getting a $50/month allowance, he&#39;s shown that he&#39;s responsible with his spending and he doesn&#39;t expect us to pick up the difference when his allowance is less than his wants. He&#39;s truly appreciative of getting an allowance.<br/>
<br/>
My hubby is working out of town this week, so after he and I talked and agreed upon the allowance increase, I asked if he&#39;d like to share the news with Andrew -- it was so cool watching the ear-to-ear smile spread across Andrew&#39;s face as they talked. I headed outside while they finished chatting, and Andrew came outside after they were done and gave me a big hug and thanked me (Rodney had told him it was my idea). I told him we were happy to do it for him. <br/>
<br/>
He said he knew that if things got really tight financially, we might have to decrease it but that would be okay with him -- and I know he means it. He&#39;s seen that I&#39;ve always treated his allowance with the same importance I treat other monthly bills -- it&#39;s budgeted and given to him when I pay bills each month, rather than being treated as an afterthought. That part is particularly important to me, not treating his allowance as an afterthought -- when I was a kid, even though we were supposed to get an allowance, actually getting it was sporadic, yet my mom and stepdad would somehow have &quot;extras&quot;, which I thought was terribly unfair. So, for me, making sure I have Andrew&#39;s allowance money for him when he&#39;s supposed to get has always been important to me, even back when he was 4 and didn&#39;t yet know the days of the week to know which day was Friday (ie, allowance day) [g].<br/>
<br/>
So, that&#39;s been our journey thus far regarding allowances. I&#39;m open to the idea of Andrew&#39;s allowance possibly increasing again a time or two before he reaches driving age. Hopefully it won&#39;t take me as long to notice when it&#39;s time for another change [g]!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-605333118">===She just loves money===<br/>
<br/>
Marla, in general, does she spend it as she gets it, or does she simply like accruing it? <br/>
<br/>
If accruing it is what she enjoys, could you give her a month&#39;s allowance all at once? If so, you could get forty $1 bills -- that&#39;s a nice little mountain of money to pile on the bed and look at [g]. Or maybe split it up so she gets $5 or $10 in quarters + some $1 bills + some $5 bills. <br/>
<br/>
When our son was younger, when my hubby&#39;s change jar would get full, he&#39;d give it to our son and tell him he could have the dollars once we exchanged the change for dollars (which we&#39;d do that day or the next). It would only happen about twice a year, but it&#39;d be anywhere from $50 or $60 each time, which was a huge treat for kiddo. (Now that he&#39;s older and gets a larger allowance, the change jar is dedicated as &quot;vacation fun money&quot;.) <br/>
<br/>
An alternative to letting a kiddo have all the money in the change jar is to let them sort out a particular kind of change -- the pennies or nickels, maybe -- and take that to the bank or money exchange machine at the grocery store and swap it out for dollars.<br/>
<br/>
For several years, Andrew would often set up a store or a cafe in his room and I would use toy money to pay him for my purchases. But you could use money from the change jar instead of toy money. For the cafe, Andrew made up a menu and he acquired a small collection of dishes from Goodwill that he chose to buy with his own allowance. He made a sign for his door, and for a short period of time he typed up a newsletter for his cafe which diners could read while they were waiting on their order [g]. If he&#39;d asked, or if I&#39;d thought about it, we could&#39;ve used change-jar money instead of toy money -- we had a toy cash register and he just opted to use the toy money that came with it. Anyway, this particular idea doesn&#39;t relate to allowance, but it is a fun way your daughter could earn some change if this kind of thing appealed to her or inspired her in any way.<br/>

her days counting coins to see if she can get a dollar or two (her favorite<br/>

an &#39;affinity&#39; for it, and often took more and more responsibility with them<br/>

the thought of so much money.<br/>
<br/>
I never had any power to make decisions and didn&#39;t get any pocket money at<br/>
all, but it was feeling important enough for me to be totalling expenses,<br/>
writing out utility cheques (with careful handwriting and correct spelling)<br/>
for dad to sign, checking for mistakes in accounts.... I felt important to<br/>
be doing money stuff and enjoyed it. They used to check my &#39;work&#39; of course,<br/>
but it took them lesser time and made them feel good about how clever their<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-192455739">Lily sounds a lot like one of my uncles. Even as a child he was very focused on money. He had a rubber band collection (or maybe it was paperclips, I don&#39;t remember) and would count it every night. If the number was off, he&#39;d hunt it down.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a favorite family story from when he was in elementary school. He was given a dollar to buy something at school, and during the walk to school memorized its serial number. When he got there to pay for whatever the dollar was for, some older boys in upper grades basically stole his dollar. When he told a teacher what had happened, he was able to give the dollar&#39;s serial number as proof that the other students had it. <br/>
<br/>
He went on to get an MBA from Harvard, work in Spain for a Spanish bank, which then took him to Hong Kong (where he lives) and China where he now works for various banks as a banking/finance consultant. <br/>
<br/>
As a child, he probably appeared to be obsessive about money. As an adult, he used it to his advantage and built on this strength. Maybe Lily has a similar tendancy?<br/>

sure that the money for running the house was in my hands, I would fill it<br/>
in super carefully and sign it (while people were watching, preferably - to<br/>
show off my importance) and then pester dad to take me to the bank where I<br/>

I bet the parents thought they were assigning me a chore. To me, it was<br/>

Seeing how much I enjoyed the process, dad set me up with a kids account for<br/>
me for any gift-money I got (till then, my parents used to take it from me<br/>
and buy things that were &#39;good for me&#39;), and pre-signed all the cheques, so<br/>
that I didn&#39;t have to feel dependent on his signature (required for minors)<br/>
for withdrawals and could simply sign and withdraw. Unfortunately, the book<br/>
itself resided in his locked cupboard :( &#39;like all important books should&#39;<br/>
