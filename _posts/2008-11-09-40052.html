wants?-=-<br/>
<br/>
If you think that&#39;s a vital difference, I&#39;m guessing you didn&#39;t  <br/>
breastfeed your children.  I could be wrong.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m right, it&#39;s still not too late to assume that a baby wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
ask for what it didn&#39;t need, and if you kept a young child cheerful  <br/>
and comfortable and fed and feeling safe, he would be content.  And  <br/>
from contentment comes more contentment.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If a child is needy for more stuff, more space, more more more, it&#39;s  <br/>
very likely that he&#39;s  heard no and don&#39;t and stop (wasn&#39;t this just  <br/>
discussed this afternoon too??)  The less a child has, the more he  <br/>
will want.  The more of a parent&#39;s time and attention a child has,  <br/>
the fewer things he will want.  (Sunday afternoon... moms of young  <br/>
school boys should be hanging out with their kids.)<br/>
<br/>
Here are articles on respect and abundance:<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why not ask; how does school teach the vital difference between needs and<br/>
wants?<br/>
<br/>
The answer being, school teaches children that going to the bathroom and<br/>
eating, both bodily functions that are not readily or healthily put on<br/>
schedules, are more like wants, to be bestowed at the convenience of an<br/>
adult, and having nothing to do with the utterly valid sensations of a<br/>
child&#39;s growing body.<br/>
<br/>
And for that reason and that reason alone, I&#39;d be keeping my kids out of<br/>
school.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Few of us &quot;need&quot; to unschool, but for various reasons we WANT to.   <br/>
But having decided that&#39;s what we want, then there are things we need  <br/>
to do.<br/>
<br/>
If I decide I want a working motor vehicle for whatever combination  <br/>
of reasons my husband and I decide merit having a car instead of  <br/>
riding the bus or walking, then there are need. Windshield wiper  <br/>
blades are no longer a &quot;want&quot; as they  might be for someone who  <br/>
didn&#39;t own a car at all but had a desire to own a wiper blade.  &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
Gasoline before driving into the mountains or the desert... need, not  <br/>
want.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve decide to own a house instead of renting.  Some maintenance is  <br/>
a need rather than a want.  The front door needs to close, or the  <br/>
cold wind will come in (and maybe the bad neighbors).<br/>
<br/>
There is a lot of &quot;if... then&quot; in the world.  Maybe the best example  <br/>
that comes around on these discussions is about whether people &quot;have  <br/>
to&quot; wash the dishes.  Is that a want or a need?  There are  many  <br/>
alternatives.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1394045550">I&#39;ve been copying the  original questioner on some of the responses.   <br/>
I&#39;ve received this:<br/>
<br/>
-=-Sandra,<br/>
I never gave you permission to post my questions publicly but you  <br/>
chose to do so.  I&#39;m not sure why someone would do that other than to  <br/>
be spiteful but that&#39;s OK.  I could really care less.  As for joining  <br/>
your &quot;groups&quot;...why the hell would I want to?  I have questions and I  <br/>
am curious..I find it interesting what people do and how they live.   <br/>
However, it&#39;s been made abundantly clear I am not welcome to question  <br/>
or have another opinion that doesn&#39;t jive with what you preach.   <br/>
Gotta go now...my boys are coming in from playing outside with their  <br/>
friends....-=-<br/>
<br/>
Response to that person who wrote to me on the side on Sunday:<br/>
<br/>
You wrote &quot;I have questions and I am curious..I find it interesting  <br/>
what people do and how they live.&quot;  That&#39;s &quot;why the hell&quot; you  might  <br/>
want more input than just mine.  Either you want to know or you  <br/>
don&#39;t.  But on the Always Learning list there are over 1000 people  <br/>
(at the moment yahoogroups says 1902 members, but I know man of them  <br/>
aren&#39;t reading regularly or have mail bouncing or whatever), and they  <br/>
DO want answers to questions and they DO care.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I never gave you permission to post my questions publicly -=-<br/>
<br/>
I never asked.  The answers to all those questions were already on my  <br/>
site, but you wanted personal attention, so I provided the attention  <br/>
of hundreds of unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How is it spiteful to get a person answers to questions?<br/>
What is spiteful is wasting the time of a stranger in insulting ways,  <br/>
so either join the list or stop writing to me, period.  Don&#39;t write  <br/>
to ANY unschoolers.  You don&#39;t want it; you don&#39;t like it.  Cease  <br/>
your stalker-like behavior.  Anything tacky or rude that&#39;s sent to me  <br/>
will be published because harrassment isn&#39;t okay, and my e-mail  <br/>
address is published on my site specifically because I&#39;m keeping an  <br/>
unschooling site.  NOBODY kept you from reading that if you were  <br/>
curious about what people do and how they live.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t revealed the name of the correspondent, but am willing to  <br/>
if the side mail doesn&#39;t stop.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1971912301">I don&#39;t know if she read the links or just looked for things not to  <br/>
like about the posted comments, but this came from the original  <br/>
questioner:<br/>
<br/>
-=-Hmm...interesting post indeed.  The assumption that a parent&#39;s  <br/>
time and love can make up for all things...very popular opinion but  <br/>
just not true.   I can remember when my boys were infants and the  <br/>
colic was so intense.  No amount of love, attachment or holding  <br/>
solved it.  I read things similar to the opinion below and it made me  <br/>
feel less than adequate. I was a new mom looking for support (from  <br/>
anywhere at that point!) and all I received from your &quot;community&quot; was  <br/>
what you just gave below.  Thanks but no thanks!  The fact remains  <br/>
that needs and wants are different....you need to eat but you may not  <br/>
want what&#39;s available.  Our life has limitations on not only material  <br/>
things but emotional things as well.  For example, &quot;Why does  <br/>
Christmas come sooner?&quot;  or &quot; Why can&#39;t Grandma and Granpda live with  <br/>
us?&quot; are things I cannot change no matter how much I may want to.<br/>
<br/>
-=-No amount of love, attachment or holding solved it. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t about colic.  A mother of a colicky firstborn  <br/>
doesn&#39;t know whether she&#39;s going to put that child in school.   But  <br/>
one way or the other, if love, attachment and holding don&#39;t &quot;solve  <br/>
it,&quot; do they  make it better?  Do they help create a relationship for  <br/>
the during and after that?  Is love better than anger?  Is attachment  <br/>
better than putting him in a crib and setting the alarm for morning  <br/>
feeding time?  Is holding better than ignoring?<br/>
<br/>
-=- Also, the judgment of what I should/shouldn&#39;t be doing proves  <br/>
what I have said all along about Unschoolers...they are mean, snide  <br/>
and arrogant.  I thought you&#39;d be different but I guessed wrong.  I  <br/>
don&#39;t think the comments you&#39;ve chosen were helpful as much as mean.   <br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers are not &quot;my community.&quot;  I try not to use that phrase,  <br/>
though it&#39;s used by others.  I much prefer to talk about principles  <br/>
and practices.<br/>
<br/>
I think when people want support, anything other than &quot;There&#39;s  <br/>
nothing more you can do.  Don&#39;t feel guilty&quot; might sound mean or  <br/>
snide.  This is what support too often looks like:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/support">http://sandradodd.com/support</a><br/>
<br/>
And to arrogance, it would seem to be humble for unschoolers to  <br/>
preface their statements with things like &quot;I&#39;m sure parents of school  <br/>
kids are discovering the same thing, but...&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m sure it&#39;s  <br/>
nothing special, but...&quot; or &quot;It might be a fluke, but my kids really  <br/>
trust me.&quot;    But when a child learns to read happily on her own,  <br/>
that&#39;s exciting!  And when a teenaged boy will sit right next to (or  <br/>
in the lap of &lt;g&gt;)  his mom or dad in front of other people, that is  <br/>
NOT the same as typical school-kid behavior.  And when an employer or  <br/>
boss contacts the parents and gushes about the teen employee or  <br/>
student, saying he&#39;s never seen anyone who&#39;s that attentive and who  <br/>
shows so much creative initiative, that&#39;s not something about which  <br/>
one can honestly say &quot;I&#39;m sure it doesn&#39;t have anything to do with  <br/>
his having been unschooled.<br/>
<br/>
If we deprecate the exciting differences, it would make parents of  <br/>
our detractors feel better.  But at what cost?  Our integrity and  <br/>
their hope of seeing the difference.<br/>
<br/>
If someone does think we&#39;re mean, snide and arrogant, why come back  <br/>
(a year and a half ago, and now again, to ask for more of the same  <br/>
answers she got when her boys were infants?  What psychology is that?<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/confidence">http://sandradodd.com/confidence</a><br/>
That&#39;s about arrogance vs. confidence.<br/>
<br/>
I will not be dishonest to comfort someone who, instead of reading my  <br/>
site or just not reading it writes to me and tells me unschooling  <br/>
isn&#39;t for her, she isn&#39;t asking for help, and she&#39;s doing fine in her  <br/>
life, and then lists a string of questions garnished with insults.    <br/>
I won&#39;t pussyfoot around what has made relationships between me and  <br/>
my kids good.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra<br/>
P.S. I thought this had been sent two days ago.  Just goes to hint  <br/>
at  how many windows I&#39;ve had opened on my computer lately...<br/>

meltdowns. There are many times when it&#39;s just the way he reacts to<br/>
not getting his way 100% of the time. (He always wants to be the one<br/>
to use the remote and not let his sister take a turn. Or yesterday he<br/>
told me I should go outside with him to play while she [6] watched the<br/>
babies, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I can&#39;t always give him exactly what he wants, and after I have<br/>
done what I *can* do, if he still gets upset, how I react positively<br/>
to him is not so much about *fixing* him or his emotions, but simply<br/>
being there *for* him when he needs me and how he needs me. Not making<br/>
his needs seem silly or bad. Not talking him to death. Just softening<br/>
the blow...<br/>

-=-<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t negate the point.   That&#39;s not typical school-kid  <br/>
behavior.  It&#39;s an exception.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s fairly typical unschooler behavior, though.<br/>
<br/>
I see teenaged girls holding their moms&#39; hands at the mall once in a  <br/>
while, and I assume they went to school.  I see girls holding their  <br/>
mom&#39;s hands all the time among unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
The criticism of that would be that it&#39;s immature, the kids aren&#39;t  <br/>
detaching, they need to be with people their own age, they&#39;re not  <br/>
going through proper stages...<br/>
<br/>
One bad thing about child development theory as it is misused and  <br/>
abused is that school&#39;s effects have been put onto the charts as  <br/>
natural.  Normal (because it has become normal, in the literal sense  <br/>
of the word).  Inevitable (which, if school is required with no  <br/>
exceptions, it would generally be).<br/>
<br/>
Just recently Holly and I were talking about the 60&#39;s and what the  <br/>
effects of the counter culture activities and thought were.  We  <br/>
talked about quite a few aspects, but I said people were interested  <br/>
in looking at what was natural with people as organisms.  &quot;Organic&quot;  <br/>
didn&#39;t mean what it means  now that the USDA owns it.  It had to do  <br/>
with what was biologically adaptive, what would be if culture and  <br/>
history hadn&#39;t affected the things we do and believe.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;So is that why they went barefooted?&quot; she asked?   And yes, that was  <br/>
why.  I told her about Earth Shoes (the early version, from Canada,  <br/>
not the later company that bought out the famous name and made more  <br/>
mainstream shoes.  I told her about women&#39;s shoes before then--too  <br/>
pointy, too narrow, too small.<br/>
<br/>
And so attachment parenting is one of those things.  Instead of  <br/>
looking at what our parents did, or even great grandparents, think of  <br/>
how homo sapiens would care for offspring if they could be seen  <br/>
without the trappings of later thought.  How do other primates take  <br/>
care of theirs?  How do other mammals?<br/>
<br/>
When I had babies and was helping other moms understand nighttime  <br/>
mothering, co-sleeping, feeding on demand and all that, one image I  <br/>
used to reassure them was that if a fox has seven kits, it doesn&#39;t  <br/>
dig seven little dens, put one in each and come back to check on them  <br/>
in the morning.  They sleep with her. It&#39;s safer, it&#39;s warmer, they  <br/>
can nurse.  I&#39;d  hardly ever get to the end of my little speech,  <br/>
though, before the mom was laughing and totally understanding it.   <br/>
But one thing I didn&#39;t say in those days, because I hadn&#39;t thought of  <br/>

&gt; When I had babies and was helping other moms understand nighttime<br/>

&gt; used to reassure them was that if a fox has seven kits, it doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; dig seven little dens, put one in each and come back to check on them<br/>
&gt; in the morning.  They sleep with her. It&#39;s safer, it&#39;s warmer, they<br/>
&gt; can nurse.  I&#39;d  hardly ever get to the end of my little speech,<br/>
&gt; though, before the mom was laughing and totally understanding it.<br/>
&gt; But one thing I didn&#39;t say in those days, because I hadn&#39;t thought of<br/>
&gt; it yet, is that they learn how to be foxes.    What&#39;s natural to many<br/>
&gt; species like that is that they become reproductive within the first<br/>
&gt; year or two, and they&#39;ll be better mothers if they&#39;ve been mothered<br/>
&gt; well.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One of the critical, crucial, seriously important things I believe my sons<br/>
are learning, by virtue of being at home instead of at school, is the act of<br/>
nurturing young. It&#39;s not on the curricula. (BWG). But when else, how else<br/>
more appropriately, do humans learn about how to nurture human young, if not<br/>
with helping with their own siblings?<br/>
<br/>
The boys are astonishing. They were helping with their sister from Day #1.<br/>
Rowan&#39;s knowledge of baby needs, started with his brother, is spot on: he<br/>
knows when she has to go potty, he knows when she&#39;s hungry, and he lets me<br/>
know. And Kestrel is an absolute master at making her laugh... when no one<br/>
else can get to her, Kestrel gets right in her face, which I would think<br/>
would upset her, but suddenly, the sun comes out of the clouds for her. When<br/>
we were driving home from a recent trip and Aurora had had quite enough of<br/>
her carseat, thanks much (she&#39;s rear-facing on a bench seat between the two<br/>
boys&#39; seats), the boys sang endless rounds of Stevie Wonder&#39;s &quot;Uptight<br/>
(Everything&#39;s Alright)&quot; to keep her happy (go figure; it&#39;s one of their<br/>
favorite songs). So there we are, heading down the highway, with two singing<br/>
boys and a baby giggling like a maniac.<br/>
<br/>
Last night, Kestrel (while holding his sister) asked me when we were having<br/>
another baby. I said that we probably weren&#39;t, but that he could have all<br/>
the babies he wanted when he grew up and became a Papa like his Papa. He<br/>
thought on that for a few minutes, and said &quot;As many babies as I can love?&quot;<br/>
I said &quot;yep, that&#39;s how it works.&quot; He got all smiley, and kept playing with<br/>
Aurora.<br/>
<br/>
I feel like this experience they&#39;ve had, Rowan with two baby siblings and<br/>
Kestrel with one, will go a long way towards giving them the tools and the<br/>
underpinning for being nurturing men when their time comes, instead of<br/>
flailing around like their father and I did.<br/>

&gt; abused is that school&#39;s effects have been put onto the charts as  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>When my oldest was little, my MIL found that series about each year--Your Two Year Old, <br/>
etc.  They were like little magic books for me and helped us soooo much.  I didn&#39;t have a <br/>
clue into child brains and couldn&#39;t appreciate the changes that were causing my sweet <br/>
little son to run and hide in department stores and then laugh meniacally when I got upset <br/>
(and had to shut the store down twice before I figured out that this wasn&#39;t working for <br/>
us!).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the books were incredibly, eerily relevant for us, down to quotes about what a <br/>
child of that age might say, but once the series got to &quot;school age&quot; and he came home <br/>
from school, everything changed. It seemed clear that the information was no longer <br/>
about developmental stages of a person, it was about how a person is affected by school.  <br/>
There was a clear divergence wherein the gap widened increasing with years spent in <br/>
school, and the information got increasing irrelevant.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Chamille still holds my hand when we are out and about.  It&#39;s something<br/>
I never expected!  At 14, I never would&#39;ve held my mother&#39;s hand in<br/>
public!  Sometimes, I&#39;m holding hands with each of my kids as if they<br/>
are both little ones, and we all walk together in that way to our<br/>
destination.  Sometimes Chamille links arms instead.  When we go ice<br/>
skating Chamille always skates with me holding my hand.  It&#39;s really<br/>
sweet!<br/>
<br/>
The other night I was really upset with my husband and my younger<br/>
daughter.  I was tired, I know, not really a good excuse, but, it felt<br/>
as if they were ganging up on me to make me miserable.  It wasn&#39;t really<br/>
the case, it&#39;s just how it felt to me.  Chamille, rather than get<br/>
involved, came over and gave me a big hug and a &quot;cheer up, it&#39;s ok&quot;,<br/>
sort of smile.  It was her way of reminding me to be calm and sweet.<br/>
<br/>
I really don&#39;t know any other teens that do this, except the unschooled<br/>
ones and an occasional homeschooled one.  I think it&#39;s rare in<br/>
traditional families, where traditional parenting happens.  It&#39;s very<br/>
common among unschoolers, and I&#39;ve seen it among homeschoolers.  I&#39;m<br/>
sure it&#39;s not coincidence.  Something is different.</div>

&gt; time and love can make up for all things...very popular opinion but<br/>
&gt; just not true.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve never ever heard unschooling advice say that a parent&#39;s time and<br/>
love can make up for all things.  It seems she&#39;s overstepping and<br/>
generalizing based on some assumptions herself.  This is classic<br/>
projecting.<br/>
<br/>
Time and love will always help a situation or moment be better.  There<br/>
are things in life that can&#39;t be made up.  Years of spanking a child,<br/>
for instance, isn&#39;t something you can make up to a child.  You can<br/>
change and stop and apologize, and maybe in time, the damage will<br/>
lessen, but it won&#39;t change the fact that spanking happened and caused<br/>
damage.<br/>
<br/>
Every time we do better as a parent, when we are kinder, gentler, more<br/>
loving, it makes life better for all of us, that is truth.  It&#39;s hard to<br/>
find something truer than that!  We can do a lot to damage our kids! <br/>
It&#39;s easy to ignore it and call it normal and even healthy.  The<br/>
challenging part is to find better ways to parent, that doesn&#39;t do<br/>
damage, and a parent can do that in every moment of every day, with<br/>
every decision they make in how they relate to their children.<br/>
<br/>
Each interaction with our kids can be moments to make our relationships<br/>
BETTER.  If we aren&#39;t doing that, than each moment is mediocre at best,<br/>
and damaging at worst.  I&#39;m not shooting for mediocrity or damage, so<br/>
I&#39;m going for better, and better is always, well, BETTER.</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As soon as I announced I was pregnant I got all kinds of comments and <br/>
horror stories about the jealousy of older siblings.  After my second <br/>
was born, people would ask, right in front of my older daughter &quot;Is she <br/>
jealous?  Is she throwing fits?  I bet you miss mommy&#39;s time, don&#39;t <br/>
you?&quot;  Well, no actually, she&#39;s not jealous, but if you keep asking <br/>
that, she might start to wonder if there&#39;s some reason she should be! <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s so helpful and intuitive about her sister&#39;s needs.  She&#39;s <br/>
learning how to be a mommy.  She knows when her sister is hungry by the <br/>
subtle signals and will say &quot;Mommy, nurse the baby!&quot;  She *wants* me to <br/>
nurse and hold the baby even when she was having a hard time with <br/>
weaning after the baby was born.  <br/>
<br/>
Of course, there are times when she wants me and I can&#39;t hold her or <br/>
play with her because the baby needs me.  But she&#39;s not *desperate* and <br/>
doesn&#39;t go to desperate measures to get my attention because she knows <br/>
that as soon as I am able I will put the baby down or give baby to <br/>
daddy or hold them both at the same time.  She&#39;s able to put the baby&#39;s <br/>
needs before her own, because she knows that her needs will get met.  <br/>
It&#39;s not a competition and there is no scarcity of love to fight over <br/>
or be jealous of.</div>

Ideally, by having been nurtured and by seeing other adults nurturing  <br/>
young.<br/>
If they want to help, cool, but it&#39;s not their job and they shouldn&#39;t  <br/>
be expected to help.  Children with no interest in helping with  <br/>

&gt; And so attachment parenting is one of those things.  Instead of  <br/>
&gt; looking at what our parents did, or even great grandparents, think of  <br/>
&gt; how homo sapiens would care for offspring if they could be seen  <br/>
&gt; without the trappings of later thought.  How do other primates take  <br/>
&gt; care of theirs?  How do other mammals?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When I had my first daughter, I felt out-of-sync with the Christian<br/>
community as a whole mostly in part because of one famous doctor and<br/>
his parenting beliefs, which were opposite mine. As I searched in<br/>
myself as to whether APing was &quot;compatible&quot; with my views of God, I<br/>
thought of the idea of Adam & Eve and their first baby. The idea that<br/>
they would ignore him, put him in another living space (not sure WHERE<br/>
they live ;)  ), etc. made no sense to me. I imagine instead that they<br/>
were *enthralled* with their new little human being and couldn&#39;t get<br/>
enough of him. They took him everywhere and kept him close all the<br/>
time. Why would they even *think* of doing anything differently?<br/>
<br/>
I also found it interesting while at the Cleveland Zoo there was an<br/>
orangutan mother with a toddler and a newborn, and both were nursing.<br/>
However, she did gently bat the older orangutan away while letting the<br/>
newborn remain. It mirrored my own relationship with my two oldest so<br/>
well that I had to laugh. I had more in common with the &quot;monkey&quot; than<br/>
most of my human friends :)<br/>

your lifestyle, &quot;Oh, *I* just don&#39;t know how you can do it. I could<br/>
*never* do that with my kids.&quot; (*that* being &quot;homeschooling&quot;<br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot; &quot;attachment parenting&quot; etc.)<br/>
<br/>
I think to myself, &quot;But in 20 years, if you could pretty much<br/>
guarantee (and I know there no &quot;guarantee&quot;, but surely the odds are<br/>
better as have been pointed out) that your relationship with your<br/>
children would be many times better *because* of what you choose to do<br/>
today, would you *then* be able to do it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Kind of like our good friends who just recently split up in a<br/>
&quot;friendly&quot; manner because the mom wanted &quot;some space&quot; to herself. She<br/>
sees her present feelings and pain and neither of them want to work it<br/>
out or get to the bottom of things. It&#39;s too much work, too much money<br/>
(for counseling) or too much &quot;something.&quot; But I wonder if they could<br/>
see their kids in 20 years from now if they&#39;d change their minds and<br/>
would *find* the time, energy and money to fix their relationship...<br/>
<br/>
The main reason I choose to keep making better choices for my family<br/>
is because I want to be able to look back in 20 years, or 30 or 50,<br/>
and regret as few moments in my life as possible. <br/>

far, they seem very close to the twins, who are almost 3 years later.<br/>
There were, and still are sometimes, moments when the babies&#39; needs<br/>
mean that some of their needs had to wait, but for the most part we<br/>
tried to find other ways of including everyone and having fun.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never been sure if it is their age gap or not, but I don&#39;t know<br/>
ANY other families that seem to have such &quot;close&quot; siblings, not in age<br/>
but in relations. They do fight, but more often they are inseparable.<br/>
And from day one with the babies they were there playing with them,<br/>
making them laugh, and now running around with them. Dr. Sears<br/>
mentioned in one of his books that co-sleeping siblings fight less<br/>
often than siblings who sleep in separate bedrooms. Not sure if that&#39;s<br/>
true or not, but so far my kids get along far better than my sister<br/>
and I ever did. (We shared a room for under a month because we talked<br/>
too much. Maybe if my parents hadn&#39;t minded us talking, we would have<br/>
remained close as sisters - I don&#39;t know...)<br/>

I still forget, sometimes, for a moment, that my kids don&#39;t have the  <br/>
pressures of the kids at school grilling them about their romantic  <br/>
relationships (or lack thereof).  When my kids make decisions about  <br/>
girlfriends and boyfriends it has never been because other people  <br/>
were pressuring them to do more, break up, get a boyfriend, take a  <br/>
girl out and report back.    The difference it makes is so big it&#39;s  <br/>
like a whole different world.  I see them doing things and thinking  <br/>
in ways I NEVER, ever (ever) could have done or imagined.  Thoughtful  <br/>
and mature ways.  They make and break friendships based on factors  <br/>
wholly different from what I had and experienced and saw growing up.   <br/>
And their relationships with siblings and parents are different too.   <br/>
It seems clear in these stages that school would&#39;ve been like a  <br/>
debilitating disease that would have crippled their ability to be  <br/>
themselves as they are now.  School stunts and mangles &#39;selves.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Even though I did well in school, academically and socially, and I  <br/>
had boyfriends and best girlfriends, it was all in and of school.   <br/>
The relationships were known and public, and played out within and  <br/>
around the framework of school&#39;s schedules.<br/>
<br/>
We had no idea there were different ways and places to be!<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t know what we neede or wanted.  We were told we needed school.<br/>

another.<br/>

about every person she meets.  She doesn&#39;t like to talk about any of<br/>
that with these girls that she is friends with because of the judging<br/>
and pettiness.  Right now, she&#39;s at a point of dismantling a few<br/>
friendships over this very thing.  She still talks to me about who she<br/>
finds attractive, but won&#39;t talk to these girls because they would never<br/>
see it.  She&#39;s not aged biased either, she finds some much older guys<br/>
attractive, although that&#39;s more uncommon.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and mature ways. They make and break friendships based on factors<br/>
&gt; wholly different from what I had and experienced and saw growing up.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I wouldn&#39;t have broken off friendships over boy infatution that<br/>
involved narrow and petty views.  I would&#39;ve been more likely to be<br/>
involved in that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It seems clear in these stages that school would&#39;ve been like a<br/>
&gt; debilitating disease that would have crippled their ability to be<br/>
&gt; themselves as they are now. School stunts and mangles &#39;selves.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In large and small ways!  Right now Chamille has pink hair.  The schools<br/>
here don&#39;t allow students to dye their hair.  I&#39;ve asked several kids<br/>
how the school would know if they are dyeing it a more natural hair<br/>
color, or lightening it or darkening it or putting highlights in.  All<br/>
of them said that those things would probably go undetected, but if you<br/>
dyed it an unnatural color, you&#39;d be sent home.<br/>
<br/>
Having pink hair may seem superficial, but it&#39;s very integral to what<br/>
Chamille is exploring in her life right now, which heavily involves<br/>
fashion, that she herself creates.  Right now she&#39;s designed a jacket<br/>
that I&#39;m transposing into a pattern for her to sew.  In the meantime,<br/>
she&#39;s making pockets and details.  She&#39;s replicating a subsection of<br/>
Japanese fashion and putting her own ideas into it.  She&#39;s very<br/>
analytical about it and studies it and picks things apart.  Our local<br/>
store finally started carrying the Gothic Lolita Bible, after months of<br/>
asking!  It&#39;s finally been made in English!<br/>
<br/>
If Chamille wasn&#39;t able to have pink hair, it would be like telling her,<br/>
her whole project couldn&#39;t happen.  That would be a huge loss of self!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The relationships were known and public, and played out within and<br/>
&gt; around the framework of school&#39;s schedules.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Absolutely!  And our kids will have a completely different understanding<br/>
about &quot;real&quot; life because of that!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-533005939">My girls have always been easily over stimulated by large groups.  In order<br/>
to feel comfortable they would need some time away from the group each day.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Every year we go to a family reunion at my sister&#39;s house 3 hours away and<br/>
we always have a blast and they look forward to it each year.  We stay<br/>
anywhere from 3 days to a full week.  Different years we have done different<br/>
things to deal with all of our need for down time.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Some years I&#39;ve felt able to afford a hotel room and we&#39;ve gone back in the<br/>
afternoon and swam in the pool or had naps in the air conditioning.  For a<br/>
few years we had a pop up camper that we took and we could withdraw to it<br/>
and play some board games or read quietly.  The last few years it hasn&#39;t<br/>
been as much of an issue as the kids are older and more able to cope and<br/>
also they realize that the time to hang out with our whole family is limited<br/>
and they want to get all they can before it&#39;s over.  But still, we reserve a<br/>
bedroom in my sister&#39;s house and we all feel like we can retreat to it when<br/>
we need to.  Sometimes its just a matter of going on an excursion in the<br/>
afternoon to regroup.  Popular destinations are the candy store and hiking.<br/>
This last summer we had our puppy with us and we would go walk him for an<br/>
hour and that was enough.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Even if you can not afford a hotel for the whole two week stay, you might<br/>
want to save so you can go for a night or two in the middle of the trip as a<br/>
time to recharge.  A pool is always a bonus too.<br/>
