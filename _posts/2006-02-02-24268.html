<div id="ygrps-yiv-637960825">Hi all<br/>
I haven&#39;t posted here (or anywhere) in quite a while.  I need some <br/>
perspective.  My kids have always slept in our room.  As babies it <br/>
was something I insisted on, when I discovered the sleep benefits.  <br/>
As they grew older I tried getting them to sleep in their own rooms, <br/>
with the idea of &quot;that&#39;s how it&#39;s suppose to be&quot;, not because I <br/>
minded them in our bed.  My dh has never been thrilled with the <br/>
idea.  He accepted the babies, because he knew it really did help me <br/>
get more rest, but as they grew, he always made comments of them <br/>
sleeping in their own rooms.  The kids always fought the idea and <br/>
always ended up in our bed sometime in the night.  My dh didn&#39;t seem <br/>
to mind that.  He wanted them to atleast start out in their own room <br/>
though( alone time for us was his idea)  It was always a huge <br/>
struggle.  Lots of time for me getting them into bed, lots of <br/>
getting out of bed, being scared and eventually they would be in our <br/>
room anyway at some point in the night.  3 years ago, our son died.  <br/>
From that point on, we all slept in one room.  My now 15 yo stopped <br/>
after a couple of months (she had been sleeping in her own room <br/>
willingly from about the age of 10-11).<br/>
My now 9yo son and 6yo dd don&#39;t seem to have any desire to sleep in <br/>
their own rooms. They would sleep in the same room if they did go <br/>
upstairs, so it&#39;s not a matter of being completely alone.<br/>
I have no desire for them to leave.  My dh isn&#39;t home at night <br/>
usually 3 nights of the week til about 2 a.m.  In the summer it&#39;s 6 <br/>
nights a week.  We just downsized to a queen(it was free and our <br/>
king was really bad) and the kids sleep on cushions on the floor <br/>
next to the bed.  I thought this would make dh happier because he <br/>
atleast isn&#39;t crowded out of the bed anymore.  But it still is <br/>
bothering him.  He usually doesn&#39;t make a big deal.  Just snide <br/>
comments here and there.  But every once in a while he has a fit <br/>
about it in front of the kids and is mad that I&#39;m not backing him <br/>
up.  I remain calm and do see his side, but I also feel I &#39;m the one <br/>
that really has to make the effort and it seems futile anyway.  And <br/>
it&#39;s not something I want to do.  He&#39;s not willing to really go <br/>
through the process of putting them to be.  He thinks they should be <br/>
sent to bed and stay there, like he did as a child (or atleast <br/>
that&#39;s what he wishes could happen).  That never worked in the past, <br/>
but he doesn&#39;t want to hear logic or opinions, he just wants it to <br/>
be easy and done.<br/>
I&#39;m thinking I should just take a stand here.  Usually it blows <br/>
over, sometimes I make a little effort but end up back to our usual, <br/>
all going to sleep in my bed together, he accepts it&#39;s not happening <br/>
and we continue to all sleep in the room.  <br/>
I&#39;m thinking they will naturally want to sleep in their own rooms at <br/>
some point (like my oldest did)  My 9yo seems to want to, but gets <br/>
scared being alone still.  My 6 yo has no desire.<br/>
Also, my oldest went to high school and goes to sleep earlier than <br/>
everyone else.  The kids rooms are upstairs and they would keep her <br/>
awake if they were up there.<br/>
I make an effort for dh and I to have &quot;alone time&quot; at other times <br/>
than night.  Dh usually sleeps in late and we can have &quot;alone time&quot; <br/>
mid morning while the kids are busy doing thier own things, so I <br/>
really don&#39;t think that should be an issue with him.  I&#39;m way to <br/>
tired at night usually, anyway. (Especially if I&#39;ve just spent a lot <br/>
of energy getting the kids in their own rooms.)<br/>
So am I being wrong or stubborn or lazy or a clingy mother here?<br/>
Should I put his wants over ours?  How can I do that without being <br/>
resentful.<br/>
Should i ask him to accept this and realize it is temporary (though <br/>
not short term)<br/>
I would really like to let the kids choose when they are ready.  I <br/>
would like them to feel completely welcome by both of us.<br/>
I think I should really take a stand here, but wanted some <br/>
perspective first.<br/>
Thanks<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Can you go to sleep with them in another room (not yours), even if  <br/>
you have to get another big bed?  And then when your husband gets  <br/>
home, get up and go to bed with him?     Sleeping together doesn&#39;t  <br/>
have to be in your bed, and it doesn&#39;t have to be all night.<br/>
<br/>
If your kids aren&#39;t really little, you could just simply say &quot;Dad&#39;s  <br/>
not having fun with everyone in the same bed anymore, so we need to  <br/>
give him more privacy.&quot;     Maybe you CAN take a stand, but take it  <br/>
in his favor, and also still sleep with the kids a lot.<br/>
<br/>
-=-So am I being wrong or stubborn or lazy or a clingy mother here?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Inflexible?  Not lazy.  Just seeing it as two choices:  all in your  <br/>
bed, or them in individual beds.  Find another big-nest option  <br/>
elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Should I put his wants over ours? -=-<br/>
<br/>
Now that sounds bad.  Quite &quot;us&quot; against Him.<br/>
One of your wants should be finding a way for him to be happy,  <br/>
right?  Isn&#39;t there an &quot;us&quot; that includes him?<br/>
<br/>
Did you throw that old king mattress out?  Maybe if the bed was worn  <br/>
out, the mattress on a floor would still be okay.<br/>
Holly uses the queen bed Keith and I had for a long time.  It&#39;s too  <br/>
worn out for me and Keith, but she&#39;s small and light, and for her  <br/>
alone it&#39;s plenty comfortable.  She likes that it&#39;s the bed in which  <br/>
she and Marty were conceived.  (Kirby&#39;s Day One involved a water bed  <br/>
in Boulder, at a friend&#39;s house.)<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to come up with One Big Plan either, but could go a  <br/>
few weeks sleeping in the den on futons, while you think about a  <br/>
longer-range plan, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
Costco has three-fold futons.  The current set has camouflage  <br/>
material on it.  There&#39;s a Japanese name for those but I forget it.   <br/>
They&#39;re not the little chair-looking things that fold out into a kid- <br/>
bed.  They&#39;re adult size, and fold in thirds and will stack flat.   <br/>
Maybe you could get three of those you could make into a wide yet  <br/>
temporary/moveable bed.  It wouldn&#39;t always have to be in the same room.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1331170424">Like others have said, just think outside the box and find something that<br/>
works for all of you. <br/>
<br/>
Our sleeping arrangements have gone back and forth over the years.  At times<br/>
I&#39;ve slept in the kids&#39; beds.  At times they&#39;ve slept in mine.  At one<br/>
point, the kids shared a room and I lay with them while they went to sleep<br/>
and snuck out at some point in the night to sleep in my own bed with dh.  <br/>
<br/>
My 9 yo was sleeping alone for the past year but recently decided to move<br/>
back into my room.  Dh travels a lot and when he is out of town she shares<br/>
my bed and when he is in town she either takes a spot on the floor or sleeps<br/>
in her own room.  <br/>
<br/>
My 11 yo, who always liked to sleep in her own room, but liked me to lay<br/>
with her while she went to sleep recently began taking forever to go to<br/>
sleep and it was really frustrating me.  I&#39;d fall asleep and she&#39;d thrash<br/>
about and wake me so many times that eventually I couldn&#39;t sleep at all for<br/>
the rest of the night.  I finally told her I would stay for half an hour and<br/>
if she wasn&#39;t asleep, then she could choose to sleep on my floor or stay in<br/>
her own bed.  She chose my floor, so now we have 4 of us in the room at<br/>
times when dh is home.<br/>
<br/>
He actually doesn&#39;t seem to mind as long as we keep a path clear to his side<br/>
of the bed so he doesn&#39;t kill himself on his way in late at night.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you find some way to keep all of you fairly happy. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-208248802">My husband is a very light sleeper, he has also been the one who <br/>
wakes up every morning at 5:00 am to go to work, so that I can stay <br/>
home with our children. I have tried to keep that in mind when <br/>
making our sleeping arrangements over the past 15 years. Mostly it <br/>
has involved me sleeping with the kids in a shared bed, then popping <br/>
back to my bed for a snuggle with my husband, then back to the other <br/>
room when someone needed me.<br/>
<br/>
My boys are now 15,13 and 10. I still lay down with my 10 year old, <br/>
usually fall asleep, wake up, and tip toe to my own room between <br/>
12:00 and 1:00 am. My husband would really love me to go to bed with <br/>
him at 10:00 however, that just doesn&#39;t fit RIGHT NOW. I know there <br/>
will be a time when I just tuck them in with a kiss and go to my own <br/>
bed, you will too.<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry for the loss of your son. I hope you find a solution that <br/>
works for all of you.<br/>
<br/>
Many Blessings,<br/>
