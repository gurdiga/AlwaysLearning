It would be interesting to compile a complimentary list of skills and experience. Too often young people are led to believe that a specific track leads to work in a specific field.

I like to consider skills and experience because for each of us some abilities come more naturally while others require more practice. Each of us enjoys certain activities more than others.

<br/>
Aptitudes.  Everyone has a range of inherent skills that, when used, generally bring a sense of happiness and competence.  For some people who were schooled or felt expectations or limitations on acquired knowledge and testable learning, natural aptitudes may be missed or ignored because &quot;that&#39;s not on the test&quot; or &quot;that&#39;s not useful right now&quot;.  Sometimes family culture influences what kids feel are acceptable skills; for instance, a family that values &quot;education&quot; (I put that in quotes because that usually means certain number of years in formal schooling, and maybe a few letters after your name) might be disappointed in a kid who loves to work with her hands and decides to fix cars. <br/>
<br/>
This is why I want to unschool my daughter - so she can explore her interests, aptitudes, and passions on her own schedule and discover for herself what pulls at her mind and heart. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve worked so many jobs that don&#39;t define me.  I make a point Not to ask people I&#39;ve just met what they do, but rather what they love doing on their own time.  that, to me, says so much more. <br/>
<br/>
(for anyone wanting to learn more about one&#39;s own aptitudes, the Johnson O&#39;Connor research foundation - <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.jocrf.org">http://www.jocrf.org</a> - has several testing centers around the US, and their testing is fun and highly informative)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-137953077"><p>I&#39;ve been thinking about this topic and how skills and experience map onto jobs.</p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">When Mo was just a baby, I made cheese for a couple months - just for fun, and I never really got good at it. I was still living communally at the time and one of my communards and I would go to a local farm and get milk on Saturday morning, good and early, open a bottle of wine, and start making cheese while Mo hung out in her swing or bouncy seat and stared around her with avid delight. I did a lot of reading about cheese and the science of it, but my friend was more into the experience and drinking wine, and I liked that part, too. And even without any real skill, home-made curds are yummy.&nbsp;<br><br>Years later, after George messed up his shoulder, I found a job casting plaster architectural details and discovered I already had all the basic skills and knowledge - not the Specific knowledge of plaster, but the basic, kitchen-level understanding of working with liquids that turn solid, mostly from those happy, wine-sodden months of cheese making with my pal. I kept that job for five years, until the management changed.&nbsp;</p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">I sew. I&#39;m a fabric junkie and a fiber geek. The vast majority of that I do as a hobby, for the pleasure of it, although I sold quilts for awhile as a part-time gig when the kids were little. But I&#39;ve had two jobs, now, because of the skills I learned sewing and knitting and goofing off with cloth and fiber. The first was constructing bellows for player pianos - they&#39;re air-driven and that means lots of little-bitty bellows, one for each key, plus larger bellows. I did the little ones. It&#39;s not hard work, but it&#39;s tedious and requires careful attention to the right details... and there are a lot of tedious details in the kinds of fiber-arts I enjoy, so it was a good match. I just returned the jigs to that job after ten years of working for him - my new job is getting too busy, and someone else wants to try his hand at bellows... someone who has done jewelry work, so he&#39;s used to tedious details too.&nbsp;<br><br>The newest job, furniture upholstery, also draws heavily on my sewing background - in fact I got it because my boss wanted someone with all the Skills of an upholsterer but who had never upholstered before so she could train them up her way. Which sounds a little unrealistic, except that it&#39;s me, exactly. I have all the right skills and experience, even though I&#39;d never upholstered before.&nbsp;</p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br>With all those jobs, it also helped that I had some knowledge of tools - &quot;guy&quot; tools, hammers and ladders and power saws. I learned to use tools building my cabin - and I decided I could build a cabin because I could make a quilt, and really, how hard could it be? Especially since I was surrounded by hippies willing to help out. So my ability to assemble scaffolding and climb it got me the job working plaster. My ability to use a saw and sander broadened my ability to make bellows. My general knowledge of how things are built comes into play every time I strip a piece of furniture and discover the frame is cracked, or a customer wants me to modify the shape of piece. Soon I&#39;ll get to learn to make headboards and padded bed-rails, and that involves woodworking, too.&nbsp;<br><br>It turns out most of my job skills don&#39;t come from my education, they come from the things I do for fun. For me, fun involves doing things with my hands, so I&#39;ve gravitated toward those kinds of jobs. I wasn&#39;t educated for that - if anything, I was specifically educated to &quot;rise above&quot; working with my hands, and all my hobbies as a kid were seen as cute, but &quot;you can&#39;t make a living at that.&quot; I sometimes wonder what my adult life would have been like if I had been actively encouraged and supported to do the things I do so naturally and joyfully. I might not be any &quot;better off&quot; financially, but I doubt I&#39;d have the lingering sense of failure from &quot;backsliding&quot; into the sort of work my grandparents did.&nbsp;</p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">---Meredith</p></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-294533390">I really enjoyed reading your adventures in fine-detailed technical things (piano bellows and plaster work).<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend whose dad was a professor, and she was going to become a biochemist or some such—went all the way to Swarthmore (from New Mexico) to have a fancy degree, and then went to San Francisco and was studying somewhere for a hotshot Master&#39;s... when she dropped out and started stripping old varnish and paint off of antique furniture for a local shop.  <br/>
<br/>
From the money invested in her education, and her parents&#39; expectations, and her own whole life&#39;s curve from having been very verbally gifted at a young age, always an academic person, this shocked everybody, including the friend. :-)  So for good measure she bought a motorcycle and discovered she was lesbian.   That last one would&#39;ve surfaced anyway, but perhaps San Francisco can be blamed for the furniture work and the motorcycle. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Another family in that neighborhood, known to me for years, had a dad in silicon valley programming, long time; a mom with all-academic interests (plus horse dressage hobby), an only child channelled to a rich destiny of glory who decided to go into police work.    !  <br/>
<br/>
So...  Yes, the current ideals don&#39;t allow for people to be curious or interested in the world around them—just to be doctors or lawyers, and not cowboys.  <br/>

<br></p><p style="font-style:normal;font-size:13.333333015441895px;background-color:transparent;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;">When Mo was just a baby, I made cheese for a couple months - just for fun, and I never really got good at it. I was still living communally at the time and one of my communards and I would go to a local farm and get milk on Saturday morning, good and early, open a bottle of wine, and start making cheese while Mo hung out in her swing or bouncy seat and stared around her with avid delight. I did a lot of reading about cheese and the science of it, but my friend was more into the experience and drinking wine, and I liked that part, too. And even without any real skill, home-made curds are yummy. <br>

<br>Years later, after George messed up his shoulder, I found a job casting plaster architectural details and discovered I already had all the basic skills and knowledge - not the Specific knowledge of plaster, but the basic, kitchen-level understanding of working with liquids that turn solid, mostly from those happy, wine-sodden months of cheese making with my pal. I kept that job for five years, until the management changed. </p>

I sew. I&#39;m a fabric junkie and a fiber geek. The vast majority of that I do as a hobby, for the pleasure of it, although I sold quilts for awhile as a part-time gig when the kids were little. But I&#39;ve had two jobs, now, because of the skills I learned sewing and knitting and goofing off with cloth and fiber. The first was constructing bellows for player pianos - they&#39;re air-driven and that means lots of little-bitty bellows, one for each key, plus larger bellows. I did the little ones. It&#39;s not hard work, but it&#39;s tedious and requires careful attention to the right details... and there are a lot of tedious details in the kinds of fiber-arts I enjoy, so it was a good match. I just returned the jigs to that job after ten years of working for him - my new job is getting too busy, and someone else wants to try his hand at bellows... someone who has done jewelry work, so he&#39;s used to tedious details too. <br>

<br>The newest job, furniture upholstery, also draws heavily on my sewing background - in fact I got it because my boss wanted someone with all the Skills of an upholsterer but who had never upholstered before so she could train them up her way. Which sounds a little unrealistic, except that it&#39;s me, exactly. I have all the right skills and experience, even though I&#39;d never upholstered before. </p>

<p style="font-style:normal;font-size:13.333333015441895px;background-color:transparent;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;"><br>With all those jobs, it also helped that I had some knowledge of tools - &quot;guy&quot; tools, hammers and ladders and power saws. I learned to use tools building my cabin - and I decided I could build a cabin because I could make a quilt, and really, how hard could it be? Especially since I was surrounded by hippies willing to help out. So my ability to assemble scaffolding and climb it got me the job working plaster. My ability to use a saw and sander broadened my ability to make bellows. My general knowledge of how things are built comes into play every time I strip a piece of furniture and discover the frame is cracked, or a customer wants me to modify the shape of piece. Soon I&#39;ll get to learn to make headboards and padded bed-rails, and that involves woodworking, too. <br>

<br>It turns out most of my job skills don&#39;t come from my education, they come from the things I do for fun. For me, fun involves doing things with my hands, so I&#39;ve gravitated toward those kinds of jobs. I wasn&#39;t educated for that - if anything, I was specifically educated to &quot;rise above&quot; working with my hands, and all my hobbies as a kid were seen as cute, but &quot;you can&#39;t make a living at that.&quot; I sometimes wonder what my adult life would have been like if I had been actively encouraged and supported to do the things I do so naturally and joyfully. I might not be any &quot;better off&quot; financially, but I doubt I&#39;d have the lingering sense of failure from &quot;backsliding&quot; into the sort of work my grandparents did. </p>
