<p class="ygrps-yiv-1448535415MsoNormal">This may not be the right place to ask this, but unschooling
and the whole philosophy behind it is very new and eye-opening to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Definitely a paradigm shift for me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So you all are my sounding board and compass
for unschooling – but as unschooling seems to involve all of life, I’m hoping
you can help me with a question about behavior.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This relates to something that happened last night while my 16yo son was
on the computer talking with his friend and playing an online game.</p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-1448535415MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-1448535415MsoNormal">All of a sudden my son just laughs uproariously, like his
friend has just said one of the funniest things he’s heard in a long time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then my son says, “You said the doctor said
you’re going to be 5-4.”<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(My son’s friend
[“Greg”] is quite short, although he is 16 or 17. My son is close to 6 feet
tall.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Something about the way Greg said
this apparently struck my son as being very very funny.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It wasn’t <span style="font-style:italic;">what </span>Greg had said, but rather <span style="font-style:italic;">how
</span>it was said – the expression and the timing. Later he went on to discuss it
with Greg in a little more depth.&nbsp; My son is generally a very kind and loving individual, and a good friend and popular member of his fairly large group of friends.<br></p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-1448535415MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-1448535415MsoNormal">Sitting in the next room hearing this, I was horrified, and
thought that my son’s reaction was very insensitive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Normally I would take him aside at some
convenient later time and talk to him about being more sensitive to people’s
situations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What do you all think about
this?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What I’ve been reading about
trusting the child – does this extend to situations like this?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How does this approach to child rearing
address behavior that may seem insensitive to others’ feelings?</p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-555327034"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;  What I’ve been reading about trusting the child – does this extend to situations like this?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The basic idea beneath unschooling is that children can learn without being taught.<br/>
<br/>
But what helps learning best is not the only factor to weigh. Is an action hurting someone? Is it causing destruction? Is it disrespectful of others?<br/>
<br/>
Social skills are probably the most difficult skills to learn. That&#39;s because the child needs an awareness not just of how well it&#39;s working for him but how well it&#39;s working for the other person. That awareness comes with ages. Kids can end up hurting others and nuking friendships if they&#39;re left to figure it out themselves before they can understand what they&#39;re doing wrong.<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s helpful both to the child and others to step in when the child is hurting someone. It&#39;s helpful to assume they don&#39;t want to hurt others. Kids just haven&#39;t mastered the skills to meet a need AND not hurt others.<br/>
<br/>
As for that situation, it sounds like it wasn&#39;t a matter of being deliberately insensitive. It&#39;s that he didn&#39;t realize he was insensitive. You could have then pointed out that how he reacted may have hurt his friend&#39;s feelings. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s usually helpful with kids to begin with the assumption that they don&#39;t know how rather than assume they do know how and have deliberately chosen to be mean or hurtful or selfish.<br/>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-1661582435MsoNormal">Yes, my son was in 11th grade at a local charter
school.&nbsp; We just withdrew him last Thursday.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was failing all of his core classes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My main concern was that his creative spirit
was being crushed, and he was getting stressed out by the weight of undone
work, failing grades and worried, disappointed parents and teachers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although he clearly <i style="">could</i> do the work (based on good grades when he turned in work, as
well as on standardized tests), for some reason we couldn’t fathom he just <i style="">wouldn’t</i> do the work!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We’ve been going through this cycle for
years, and at this point we just felt like something different had to be
done!<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-1661582435MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-1661582435MsoNormal">Our son is excited about unschooling – except he’s afraid of
losing his friends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has lots of ideas
for things he’d like to do and learn.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His fear for himself is that he will not actually do anything, but
rather will sit around and play video games all day long.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I know we are supposed to trust the child and
the method, but I do think his concern is a valid one, given his history of not
putting much effort into things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
instance if he feels he’s going to lose a foot race, he will just stop
running.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I see that some of this may
come from my being demanding of him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I’m
sure I’ve made many mistakes that have harmed his spirit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-1661582435MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-1661582435MsoNormal">Another concern is the standard estimate of needing to
deschool for 1 month for each year of schooling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that rate he’d be almost 18 by the time he
had school well out of his system.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
that’s really a separate question for a separate post.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is what we have, and as Sandra says in
her link: “If you’re going to unschool, do it now and do it well.”</p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-1661582435MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-1661582435MsoNormal">Our son has one brother, who is 7 years older than he
is.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His brother did very well
academically, and temperamentally is very different than his younger brother
(quiet, deep and with few friends).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our
16yo is very outgoing socially, and shares his feeling easily and
unselfconsciously – although he too has deep thoughts and ponders many
imponderables.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p></div>

Here was the first one, in case you said something in a different way and it might help:<br/>
<br/>
_______<br/>
<br/>
Yes, my son was in a charter school which was pretty good as schools go -- but he just wasn&#39;t interested in what was being taught -- even the extracurricular opportunities, which were many and varied.  He was on track for failing all of his core courses for the semester.  This &quot;disinterest&quot; has been going on for years.  He is interested in things, but seems to lack the &quot;get up and go&quot; to actually pursue them, especially when it looks like it might take more than a modicum of effort.  We just took him out of school last Thursday, from 11th grade.  We&#39;re deschooling right now, and he&#39;s coming up with all kinds of things he wants to do,  I&#39;m trying to help with providing experiences and resources, without putting &quot;shoulds&quot; and too many suggestions on him.  I still have a LOT to learn!<br/>
<br/>
He has an older brother -- seven years older and very different temperamentally (quiet and introspective).  No younger siblings. <br/>

<br/>
Then don’t criticize the way he is with his friends, I think.<br/>
Maybe, at most, ask “Do you think that might have hurt his feelings?”<br/>
or<br/>
“Maybe because you’re tall, it’s hard to know how someone might feel if he’s short.”<br/>
<br/>
But I would let him heal from school and pressure, and try to keep life light and airy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1372775110"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Although he clearly could do the work (based on good grades <br/>
&gt; when he turned in work, as well as on standardized tests), for <br/>
&gt; some reason we couldn’t fathom he just wouldn’t do the work!  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It isn&#39;t hard to fathom. If I assigned you to learn Bolivian history how well would you do? If I then judged your worth by whether your learning met the standards I set, how would it affect your sense of self?<br/>
<br/>
When people are learning what they value, they learn exceptionally well. When people don&#39;t value what they&#39;re required to learn, it&#39;s very difficult. When people are judged by standards that aren&#39;t their own, it can be soul crushing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; except he’s afraid of losing his friends.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is a valid concern. He won&#39;t be able to see them without effort. And he also will have less in common with them.<br/>
<br/>
Do make it a priority to find ways for them to get together. It will help him accept any drifting in friendships if he knows he is trying.<br/>
<br/>
Also find opportunities for friendships outside of school. A big plus is he won&#39;t be limited to people his age. He can, like adults do, form friendships based on interests.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; His fear for himself is that he will not actually do anything, <br/>
&gt; but rather will sit around and play video games all day long.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Until he&#39;s gotten school out of his system, that&#39;s what deschooling can look like.<br/>
<br/>
It will help him to realize that the reason he wasn&#39;t doing school work was because it wasn&#39;t meaningful to him. He naturally realized it was taking more from him than it was giving back. And it would have been surprising if he had found meaning in it!<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling *doesn&#39;t* look like kids working on school independently. It looks like exploring interests. It looks like play. That&#39;s how we naturally learn. And it works really really well. After all nature has had several million years to perfect it ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1780784022">He just turned 16 in July.&nbsp; I was basing the estimate on 11 years of school (Kinder was pretty academic), as well as Preschool for a year -- so really about a year of deschooling, using the 1mth/yr rule of thumb (I guess my math was a little off there!).&nbsp; He wasn&#39;t pressed ahead, but as I recall he was at the cusp of being allowed to enter Kinder or stay out of school for another year, and we decided to put him in school at that point.&nbsp;</div>

interested in playing video games. &nbsp;Video games are for people who really enjoy solving challenging problems, putting to use their out-of-the-box thinking and long term focus to help them achieve their goals. &nbsp;People don&#39;t seem to appreciate that. &nbsp;</div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;"><br></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34,

&nbsp;He has changed the way we search and categorize photos online. &nbsp;We were talking about how much Ethan enjoys video games. &nbsp;I have historically assumed that people in the computer science field would embrace game play, but that is most often not the case, and this was one of those times. &nbsp;After sharing a bit of my son&#39;s enthusiasm, this man looked down at the ground and told us that he was ashamed because he used to play video games too much. &nbsp;He said he wasted a lot of time. &nbsp;I was gobsmacked. &nbsp;I looked under at him to make eye contact again and I asked him if he really thought it was time wasted, or if he had ever considered it was time invested, contributing in a real and meaningful way to who he is today. &nbsp;He literally was tongue-tied, seemingly never having thought this before, and quietly asked himself aloud could it be possible that playing all those games had contributed to his current success. &nbsp;He answered his own question in the negative, but I could see the wheels working for some time after that. &nbsp;</div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;"><br></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;">There are several successful people who do, however, see their game playing as a strong contributing factor in their success. &nbsp;Eric Demaine (http://erikdemaine.org/) is a professor at MIT. &nbsp;He openly talks about how important video games were in his early years. &nbsp;He programmed his first game at age eight. &nbsp;</div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;"><br></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;">John Carmack is currently CTO of Oculus. &nbsp;My husband recently visited with him. &nbsp;He too celebrates his in-depth love of gaming. &nbsp;He was lead programmer on games such as Doom, Quake and Castle Wolfenstein -- games my husband and I played hours of together when we were younger. &nbsp;Mr Carmack is known for giving fascinating talks without having prepared a thing in advance. &nbsp;You might enjoy googling him.</div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34,

professor at Cornel University in the computer science department, played hours and hours of games, starting with the board game Risk, following with nearly every Atari game ever made, then followed by a series of PC first player shooter games. &nbsp;Currently, he plays Starcraft 2. &nbsp;He will still play for hours when he can. &nbsp;He loves playing. &nbsp;It helps him unwind as well as keeps his mind sharp. &nbsp;Recently Doug taught a lecture in his introduction to computer science class, where he used Starcraft 2 as an example he was hoping the students could relate too. &nbsp;He said it was humourous to see the faces of the students before him -- a room of 400 bodies. &nbsp;A few even took pictures of him talking in front of his slides because (I assume) they were so surprised a professor was using a video game to illustrate the material they were learning. &nbsp;And, he knew his game, so that was even more impressive! &nbsp;:-)</div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34,

fun, you and your son might like to check out a book called &quot;Ready Player One&quot; by Ernest Cline. &nbsp;The whole plot revolves around celebrating video games and pop culture. &nbsp;Doug is reading it aloud to Ethan and me. &nbsp;We&#39;re nearly done, and it has been so fun! &nbsp;There is some mature language and themes, but it should be good for a boy your son&#39;s age. &nbsp;Ethan, who is eleven, is enjoying it very much.</div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;"
