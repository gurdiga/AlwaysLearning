<div id="ygrps-yiv-381147704">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I introduced myself the other day and have been reading along.  You all <br/>
certainly find interesting things to talk about!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really curious to find out about PCS Edventures and the Jason <br/>
Project.  Does anyone have anything (good or bad) to share about these <br/>
projects?<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t even know what they are.<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re educational materials, not many unschoolers use &quot;educational <br/>
materials,&quot; and you might do better asking on a more structured homeschooling <br/>
list.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1509476818">I found out about these at an unschooling conference - one person <br/>
mentioned that they might be good for my son&#39;s interests in science. <br/>
 I&#39;ve looked at the sites, but in order to see what Jason is really <br/>
about, you have to get involved and pay out the bucks, so I was hoping <br/>
to find someone who has done it.  It&#39;s supposed to be a planned science <br/>
project led by a researcher (can&#39;t remember his name but the guy who <br/>
found the Titanic at the bottom of the ocean) where you do activities <br/>
where you can learn about the project he is doing for the year, and then <br/>
become involved in a sense through internet tv watching him carry out <br/>
his real life science.  <br/>
<br/>
PCS Edventures seems to be building projects, mostly from LEGOs, in <br/>
different areas - engineering, architecture, etc.<br/>
<br/>
These both seem to be geared toward &#39;school supplements&#39;.  Things that <br/>
kids can do with school or aside from school that would actually be <br/>
interesting to them.  But they both have put a hand into the homeschool <br/>
market.  Anyway, I was hoping to get perspectives on them from <br/>
*unschoolers*, because if they are too schoolish, my kids won&#39;t do them <br/>
and that&#39;s pretty much what I was afraid of.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m afraid I disagree.  Unschoolers use educational material all the <br/>
time.  Just not usually things that are marketed as such.  :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2099899271">Sadly Sandra,<br/>
I know about the Jason Project. I have only heard about PCS Edventures, <br/>
but I only had time to learn about the Jason Project. The reason it even <br/>
interested me is because this year they were doing the Channel Islands, <br/>
and we were planning our own camping trip to one of the islands. They <br/>
also do some kind of meat the scientist for one week,  I am trying to <br/>
get in, but I didn&#39;t finish the inservice, so I don&#39;t know if I will be <br/>
able to get in.<br/>
Any way, I don&#39;t think any of these have very much educational merit. I <br/>
don&#39;t really have anything good to say about them, and from an <br/>
unschooling point of view, my oldest son looked at it, and said they <br/>
really didn&#39;t accomplish their objectives and should give up. The rest <br/>
of us never did get into it much, we were more interested in the <br/>
 camping trip and meeting the scientists, so attempted to jump through <br/>
some hoops. Made the first one and just stopped.  Sadly the camping trip <br/>
was canceled due to my son&#39;s surgery, and the children are not sure if <br/>
they want to meat the scientists.<br/>
I have too much negative examples and experience with this to share over <br/>
the loop, but hey it only cost $75 dollars and a full day of your time <br/>
to look into it. OR you can split the cost with a friend and then just <br/>
slink through their workshop and leave when you get the picture like me. <br/>
(A bit costly and time consuming)<br/>
They are set up to work in a classroom, the project are cheesy and pre <br/>
designed so any instructor can use them for about 40 students.  The trip <br/>
and meeting sound coool, but the rest is not worth it, and if your son <br/>
loves science this will not foster a love for it. Supposedly the first <br/>
Jason Projects that were published were more along the scientific lines, <br/>
but some school academics committee got a hold of it, and redesigned it <br/>
to meet each separate subject in school. So now it is no longer as <br/>
scientific. I haven&#39;t seen the first ones, just the complaints by the <br/>
teachers that they were not classroom friendly and very difficult to <br/>
read---so scientific that only a scientist could follow. I assume they <br/>
were better, based on those statements.<br/>
