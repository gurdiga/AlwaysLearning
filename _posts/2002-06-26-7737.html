<div id="ygrps-yiv-983323021"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;So I suppose it was good, even though embarrassing,<br/>
&gt;for me to see where I COULD have ended up if I hadn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;pursued truth&#39;n&#39;light (lite) which, for me, took the<br/>
&gt;form of Adult Children of Alcoholics and La Leche<br/>
&gt;League all in the space of a year and a half.   <br/>
&gt;Lights were flooding on all over.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s an interesting parallel Sandra.  My path<br/>
intersected with Alanon also, as an &#39;adult child.&#39;  Do<br/>
you suppose that the extremity of our families&#39;<br/>
unhealthiness (yours and mine) shoved us enough to<br/>
wake us up, whereas people with families whose<br/>
dysfunction is more mild, more &#39;normal&#39;, often don&#39;t<br/>
get a wake up call, but continue to function as what<br/>
my husband and I call sleepwalkers?  That is: those<br/>
who are not truly aware of themselves, their lives,<br/>
their emotions and surroundings; someone going through<br/>
the motions; repeating the status quo; with no deep<br/>
spiritual/emotional connection to the universe or<br/>
their loved ones; etc.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t feel I was really sleepwalking before Alanon,<br/>
but I was a very angry and discontent person,<br/>
disconnected emotionally from myself and others, and<br/>
from my past.  Alanon made a big difference in that<br/>
department however.<br/>

<br/>
Same for me, but I was OVERemotioanlly connected to myself an others.  <br/>
ACA helped me relax, emotionally speaking, and to wait.  I learned patience <br/>
and perspective.<br/>

<br/>
Partly the sock of any trauma triggers thinking (or triggers SHUT DOWN and <br/>
avoidance of thinking, sometimes).  People&#39;s lives change from <br/>
life-threatening diseases and car accidents and such too.<br/>
<br/>
But I think it&#39;s a combination of interpersonal/intrapersonal skills, sad <br/>
memories of childhood, and being parents that causes some people&#39;s awareness <br/>
and empathy for their children to be extra sharp.<br/>
<br/>
People whose childhoods were tolerably fine and who aren&#39;t much into <br/>
self-reflection and who don&#39;t read other people&#39;s subtleties very well will <br/>
have no reason to make any life-transformations like unschooling, I figure.<br/>
