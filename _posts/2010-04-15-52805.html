<div id="ygrps-yiv-206660846">My two oldest boys absolutely love Roblox and  my 8 year old recently made a comment about how his friends are not allowed to play there during school hours (they are mostly homeschooled but not allowed on the computer except weekends).  I volunteered to see if I might be able to find some unschooling Roblox friends for him online.  James&#39; name is JandB2001 and Ben is BenJAMin 2003.  If anyone&#39;s kids would like to send a friend request they would love it. <br/>
When I suggested this yesterday, James was very shocked to find out there are other families that &quot;dont do school, even at home&quot;.  <br/>
Thanks</div>

I&#39;ll give them your boys&#39; usernames. Please tell them to look for Nic44.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone else wants to friend him there he&#39;d be thrilled.<br/>
<br/>
Theo doesn&#39;t yet have his own account as he and Nic are an<br/>
almost-inseparable computer team.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reminding me. The boys have been loving Wizard 101 and<br/>
addictinggames.com and totally forgot to checkin at roblox for a long time<br/>
now. They squealed with glee when I asked them about it just now.<br/>
<br/>
Suffice to say, they&#39;ll be on there as soon as they get out of the shower.<br/>

peace,<br/>
