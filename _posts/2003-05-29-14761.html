<div id="ygrps-yiv-1867208403">Well, her names are creative anyway!!<br/>
We have a furry little girl here named Luna, that was my favorite on her list <br/>
of course. <br/>
Luna is a rattie, black with white markings and oh-so-sweet.<br/>
<br/>
I had started a childrens story with a character named Periwinkle. I&#39;m not <br/>
sure I like her &quot;booger&quot; name though. :)<br/>
<br/>
Sierra&#39;s middle name is Star. I like Azia, Connor, Donovan too.<br/>
My dh liked Biff, Turk and Astra. Hmmmmm....<br/>
I think he has issues.<br/>

wouldn&#39;t have fit well with Grove for a last name.  But that was in 1975.<br/>
Long trend?<br/>

Lots of hippie names in New Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
My cousin named her first couple very hippie names.  <br/>
<br/>
Pablo Monte Fe Trujillo (Paul Mountain Faith, but on his birth certificate I <br/>
think it&#39;s in Spanish), Oceana Desert Fawn Trujillo<br/>
<br/>
Then she went to Jacob, Rebeccah and Louis, not as wild and crazy. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Jake--he&#39;s never been in a class or a baseball team without another Jake.  I <br/>
have a John--well, we knew going in there would be plenty of those.  (To be <br/>
more unique, he dropped the H from his name--now he&#39;s just like all the <br/>
Jonathan&#39;s!)  And I have a Will--and while it&#39;s not as popular as Jake was, they&#39;re <br/>
popping up all over the place, too.  Shoulda called him Billy--then he&#39;d only <br/>
have to compete with his female cousin!<br/>

idea to name him that.<br/>
