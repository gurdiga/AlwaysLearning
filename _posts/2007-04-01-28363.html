<div id="ygrps-yiv-659977392">I have been recently  reading  several emails from the orangehomeschoolers and always learning sites.re. people who have decided to unschool  and/or homeschool. I am delighted to be part of this support network and have read so many heartwarming emails.<br/>
   <br/>
  I wanted to share with all of you my recent experience with finally making &quot;the decision&quot; to take my 16 year old daughter out of high school.  Many years ago we took our now 27 year old out of school at 14 years old.  She has gone on to college and is very happy and has a wonderful job that she loves.  Out younger daughter is now back to the delightful person that she used to be.  Her anger, frustration, and headaches have been replaced by an unbelievabe yearning to learn.  She finally reads a lot and is so happy and has so much more enthusiasm about things than when she was in school.  All of my doubts about being home have disappeared entirely.<br/>
   <br/>
  I would love to know if anyone has a daughter around 16 that she could possibly get to meet who is also home or unschooled.<br/>
  Thanks,<br/>
  Ann<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi - my daughter is 16, and I also have a 14 year old son, both always <br/>
unschooled. (I haven&#39;t been active on any lists--I posted occasionally <br/>
on a couple, years ago when the kids were little. Mostly I&#39;ve lurked, <br/>
on and off, over the years.)<br/>
<br/>
My kids know a lot of homeschoolers, but we have a harder time finding <br/>
unschoolers their age. Would your daughter be interested in chatting <br/>
(through email or IM) with mine? Email me if she is and we can put them <br/>
in touch.<br/>
