<div id="ygrps-yiv-876565126">I&#39;m new to this group, and I&#39;m finding the discussion about food to <br/>
be very interesting.  Long ago I read a book about ways to avoid <br/>
eating disorders among children, and the one I remember most was to <br/>
let them eat whatever they want, whenever they want.  I also listened <br/>
to a diet/lifestyle tape by Anthony Robbins (a motivational speaker), <br/>
and he told an interesting story.  He said he bought a package of <br/>
crackers or cookies, and his family gobbled them up.  So then he <br/>
bought a case of the same item, and it sat and sat in the cupboard.  <br/>
He realized that when there was just a small amount available, <br/>
everyone wanted some.  But when there was enough that people saw it <br/>
wasn&#39;t going to be eaten by someone else, it lost its appeal.<br/>
<br/>
I did a test.  I went to the store with my children (they were <br/>
probably around 4, 7, and 9) and let them buy what they wanted.  They <br/>
split a case of Oreos and each bought some of their favorite candy.  <br/>
They had separate areas to keep all of their food, but I said not to <br/>
worry--I&#39;d buy more if they ran out.  And I let them eat it whenever <br/>
they wanted to.  Yes, it was hard for me!!  But they did exactly what <br/>
that book said they would--they spent maybe the first week eating <br/>
candy and ice-cream for breakfast, and then grew tired of it.  <br/>
They&#39;re not even crazy about Oreos any more.  But I think the main <br/>
thing is that they were seeing if *I* was really going to let them do <br/>
what I said.  Even when we were buying the stuff, if they asked for <br/>
one package, I threw two in the cart, just to let them know I was <br/>
serious!<br/>
<br/>
This discussion has been a good reminder for me to get back into this <br/>
way of thinking (I&#39;ve slipped a bit with the &quot;good food/bad food&quot;), <br/>
and it&#39;s a reminder of how my own food issues are so different from <br/>
the way my children think.  I could devour a large bag of chips in <br/>
one sitting (because it was a &quot;bad&quot; food)--and my children eat a <br/>
portion and put the rest away.  It&#39;s not a forbidden food for them.  <br/>
My youngest (we didn&#39;t know he&#39;d done this) pigged out on greasy <br/>
chips one day, and actually threw up later--and he still remembers <br/>
that and won&#39;t overeat them again!  I&#39;ve realized over the past week <br/>
or so (since first reading this discussion), that my children <br/>
normally do ask for foods that make them feel good, even if they do <br/>
occasionally eat the sugary stuff in between.  They even realized, <br/>
after the candy binge from the 4th of July parade, that they felt <br/>
sick and at 10pm asked for vegies and rice!<br/>
<br/>
And I also agree with the idea to make foods easily available <br/>
(the &quot;Monkey Plate&quot; was great!)--if I ask if they want something, <br/>
they usually say no--but if I leave out a plate of washed grapes or <br/>
cut up fruit, they&#39;ll eat it.<br/>
<br/>
Someone asked, &quot;how can I trust my children, when I don&#39;t trust <br/>
myself?&quot;  I think the answer is by showing you trust them, they&#39;ll be <br/>
trustworthy. You can work on yourself separately, if you feel you <br/>
need to.  Long ago I read a book by someone who overcame an eating <br/>
disorder, and she made a big bowl of cookie dough and ate that for <br/>
two weeks, and that helped her get over the binge cycle.  It&#39;s <br/>
getting rid of the &quot;forbidden foods&quot; idea.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this is long, but it&#39;s really important to me because I did <br/>
have an eating disorder and don&#39;t want to do to my children what my <br/>
parents did to me.  Even when I ate an apple, my dad would say, &quot;no <br/>
wonder you&#39;re so fat--you&#39;re eating all the time.&quot;  I was about 10 <br/>
lbs overweight.  Kids don&#39;t even understand what&#39;s going on with <br/>
food, except that when it&#39;s used in a controlling way, they&#39;re going <br/>
to binge when given the chance.  I love it when I see my children <br/>
turn down offers of food (things I would have considered &quot;treats&quot; and <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have missed an opportunity to eat) or put a bag away before <br/>
it&#39;s finished--I see that food has a different place in their lives <br/>
than it did in mine.</div>
