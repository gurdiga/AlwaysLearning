<div id="ygrps-yiv-144630603">Jackie said:<br/>
&lt;&lt;Did you take your kids to it? If you did, how did that go?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I did not take my kids as they are 5 and 10 months respectively.  I would<br/>
like my daughter(s) to see it eventually, but she is not much of a fan of<br/>
the movie theatre, yet.  She did surprise me today by asking, after a brief<br/>
conversation about the show, if we could try to rent the PBS special<br/>
&quot;Frontier House.&quot;  She doesn&#39;t remember seeing it, and I guess it sounded<br/>
interesting to her, but it surprised me as she has not made that kind of<br/>
request before. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I think we will get it on DVD when it comes out, and then she will<br/>
have a chance to see it, if she wants.  More than likely, she will see bits<br/>
and pieces of it while I am watching it, as opposed to sitting through it at<br/>
one go.<br/>
<br/>
I remember you saying that your household has had many discussions about it.<br/>
I am hoping to do the same, first with my husband, and then with the girls<br/>
as they grow and so does the field of knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
Did you feel that they made the point that life learning is actually the<br/>
only way we can possibly learn anything?  That as an observer alone in our<br/>
heads that we choose what &quot;reality&quot; will be to us, which of course is<br/>
exactly what learning is, and that it&#39;s all about perspective so that we<br/>
limit ourselves when we lay an artificial layer of structure over our<br/>
learning (as in, for example, public school life, as opposed to independent<br/>
study of a subject that interests us).<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh yeah!  I got this out of the movie.  I saw it twice in August, and I&#39;m<br/>
planning on seeing it again soon.  I may have been the one to recommend it,<br/>
don&#39;t know.  I&#39;ve been telling everyone they should see it.<br/>
<br/>
I really loved the part of the movie where they talk about how it doesn&#39;t<br/>
make sense to believe that we can remember the past but not the future, and<br/>
that we can effect the future but not the past.  What did the guy say... to<br/>
believe this is to be 3/4 of the way to dead...<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and one of the favorite sections of the movie for many people is where<br/>
the scientist talks about how he wakes up in the morning and creates his<br/>
day.  The text of this particular part of the movie used to be on their<br/>
website, but I can&#39;t find it on their newly designed site.  Too bad!<br/>
<br/>
About book recommendations... I like Depak Chopra.  He has written several<br/>
books about how quantum physics applies to our lives, mostly in the area of<br/>
health but there are great extensions from there to living life.  He also<br/>
simplifies the ideas with examples.<br/>
<br/>
Someone else recommended:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I highly recommend Susan James of<br/>
&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.susanjames.org">http://www.susanjames.org</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;She coined the phrase &quot;User Friendly Physics&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Her stuff looks interesting, but it also looks to me more like self-help<br/>
than books to understand quantum physics.  I&#39;m not saying that I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
suggest them... just that they may be more of a tool for using your<br/>
thoughts in a new way to manifest what you want from life (which I believe<br/>
in, and quantum physics supports) rather than a book to understand the<br/>
principles of the subject.<br/>
<br/>
And, here are other recommendations from their website: &quot;The Field: The<br/>
Quest for the Secret Force of the Universe&quot; (&quot;the best overall book to<br/>
introduce all of the concepts raised in the film.&quot;) and &quot;The Matter Myth:<br/>
Dramatic Discoveries that Challenge Our Understanding of Physical Reality&quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, we talked a lot about it, and bought Masaru Emoto&#39;s book &quot;The Hidden<br/>
Messages in Water&quot; the same day because we were so curious about the bit<br/>
about his work in the movie. The book sits in our living room and a day<br/>
doesn&#39;t go by when I haven&#39;t noticed someone browsing through it (it shows<br/>
the difference in the growth design of water crystals when they are exposed<br/>
to different words). We talked about the movie the day we saw it, but since<br/>
have made reference to it many times when it has related to something in our<br/>
day, or some enlightenment someone is working on.<br/>
<br/>
Our youngest son Cameron who is 10 sites this movie as one of his top 10,<br/>
which surprises me because I think he was actually bored by it. I think what<br/>
he likes is that it sparked so much neat conversation among all of us.<br/>
<br/>
In truth, I don&#39;t remember movies much after I see them. It is the same for<br/>
this one, however I remember the messages I took away very well. I was<br/>
confused numerous times during the movie, I actually think they could have<br/>
done a better job making the messages clearer, because I think the truth of<br/>
what they are saying is simpler than the movie makes it. As a small budget<br/>
indie documentary however, I thought it was revolutionary.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I did think they made the point that we have much more choice in life than<br/>
most of us partake in. Or maybe better said, the choices that many of us<br/>
make lead us down a deadened path, rather than a life-fulfilling path. And<br/>
that our every thought can shape our world.<br/>

Hey, we are practically neighbors!  I saw the movie<br/>
here in Tucson and really enjoyed it. <br/>
<br/>
I have a science book to recommend - &quot;The <br/>
Elegant Universe:  Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions,<br/>
and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory&quot; by Brian<br/>
Greene.<br/>
<br/>
I was about halfway through the book when I went to<br/>
see the movie.  I LOVE this book.  It is really well<br/>
written, so that non-science folks (like me) can grasp<br/>
the concepts.  It talks about General Relativity and<br/>
Quantum Mechanics & the problems encountered with<br/>
them.  And then it talks about Superstring Theory,<br/>
which is a surprising & thrilling theory.  If you&#39;d<br/>
rather watch than read, Nova did a 3 hr special on it<br/>
& you can watch it online at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/elegant/">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/elegant/</a><br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; is on my level or books that could lead me<br/>
&gt; there, by<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the hand, as it were?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Check out the book &quot;Thinking Physics&quot; by Lewis Carroll<br/>
Epstein. It&#39;s really a fun, thought-provoking book. It<br/>
presents physics problems in small bites, and asks you<br/>
to decide what you think will happen. Then it gives<br/>
several possible answers (one right; several wrong)<br/>
and explains why the one is right and the others<br/>
wrong.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m doing a poor job explaining, I&#39;m afraid. But the<br/>
author really  makes physics concepts accessible --<br/>
and fun, too. When we&#39;ve sat down together with the<br/>
book, it&#39;s almost playing a game, with everyone trying<br/>
to guess and predict the answers.<br/>

snip from the article&gt;&gt;Not until the credits roll, when the &quot;experts&quot; are finally introduced, do we learn that the two people who do most of the talking about neuroscience and physics are not actually scientists. One is a chiropractor. The other is a 35,000-year-old warrior named Ramtha, who is being &quot;channeled&quot; by a blonde woman from Washington&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hey, I met her once, about 13 years ago.  I was shopping with my mom in Nordstrom in Tacoma.  Ramtha&#39;s so-called channeler, J.Z. Knight, was shopping with her friend, Linda Evans.  My mom had met Evans at work, so we chatted for a few minutes.  I was pregnant with my 1st child at the time.  Knight told me what the baby&#39;s sex would be, but I can&#39;t remember which she said.  50/50 chance of being right anyway, mystic being or not.<br/>
