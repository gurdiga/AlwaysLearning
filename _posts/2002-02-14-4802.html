<div id="ygrps-yiv-681979470">I have a collection of used book sites-<br/>
I&#39;d like to share then with you- I NEVER pay full price for a book.<br/>
The biggest used book search site (searches many used sites) is:<br/>
www.bestwebbuys.com/books/<br/>
<br/>
Ths site I buy from the most is www.half.com<br/>
I have also sold many many books on this site- and it&#39;s VERY easy- much easier than auctions.<br/>
<br/>
I also wanted to say that I have joined many different groups- and &quot;un&quot;joined because of the constant bickering- but I have really enjoyed your posts.<br/>
Thanks for inspiring me-<br/>
oh yeh- and <br/>
HAPPY VALENTINE&quot;S DAY!<br/>

Has anyone else noticed the miraculous healing qualities that a bit of Pepsi had with &quot;sick&quot; kids?<br/>
It&#39;s amazing!<br/>

<br/>
When my son was five and six he made up a sister and her name was Reenie.<br/>
 He spelled it just that way.  He drew pictures of her, she always had<br/>
pig tails, and he&#39;d tell me long stories about stuff they did together. <br/>
We even had to set the table for her.  We didn&#39;t mind because previously<br/>
we set the table for Godzilla monsters. <br/>
Except for the invisible sister, I&#39;d never seen that name before, but I<br/>
like it.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, we&#39;ve used to soda pop cure before too, but we use Coke.<br/>
I think the stimulant hides mild symptoms, making the sick person feel<br/>
better.  <br/>

The biggest used book search site (searches many used sites) is:<br/>
www.bestwebbuys.com/books/<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
www.bookfinder.com and www.addall.com are both bigger and better -- they<br/>
search every major (and some minor) bookselling database (the places that<br/>
used and rare book dealers list their books for sale).<br/>
<br/>
Half.com is a fine site, but they deal only with books that are recently<br/>
published (1970 and later) as they only accept for sale books with ISBN<br/>
numbers, and those didn&#39;t start being assigned until the early 70&#39;s (and not<br/>
with predictable regularity until the mid-70&#39;s or a bit later). For those<br/>
looking for earlier editions, or books that were not reprinted after the<br/>
70s, I recommend a broader search with one of the sites above.<br/>

<br/>
Interesting. I was wondering when they became standard.<br/>
<br/>
Half.com is actually in the bookfinder.com database, anyway...<br/>
