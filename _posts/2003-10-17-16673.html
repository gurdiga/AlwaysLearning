<div id="ygrps-yiv-489221287">I typed a nice long response, but the computer ate it!!!<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t seem to get a message to reply directly.  I have to go in & <br/>
send a seperate post.  Is anyone else having this problem?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I just wanted to say that you have definetely vented to <br/>
sympathetic ears.  It always saddens me to see children more attached <br/>
to the daycare workers or even worse to no one at all then their own <br/>
family.  And this thing about not allowing siblings to be together <br/>
just boggles my mind.  I have heard so many people of my parents <br/>
generation talk about how great their kids got along until they <br/>
started school & then it was all down hill from there.  My two <br/>
children play wonderfully together the vast majority of the time.  It <br/>
always surprises me to hear that that is not the norm in our society.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is hard for a parent to ever admit that something they <br/>
have done to or for their children is wrong.  Despite this, maybe <br/>
something that you have said to your sister will sink in one day or <br/>
maybe she will witness an incident and everything you have said will <br/>
kick in.  If nothing else she is witness to the example & closeness <br/>
of your family.  I know it must make you feel so sad to see your <br/>
sister and her kids miss out on something so special that they will <br/>
never get back.  <br/>
<br/>
As for your comment on the toilet training of elephants, or was that <br/>
children, it reminded me of a time that I was at a pre-school doing a <br/>
toy fundraiser.  There were about 15 kids all lined up waiting to go <br/>
to the bathroom.  This by itself was a little unsettling, but not as <br/>
much as what followed.  This daycare worker stepped out of the <br/>
bathroom with a face mask on and gloves with her hands held up.  It <br/>
looked like something out of a horror flick.  One of the children <br/>
toward the end of the line could not wait & had an accident.  A <br/>
complete sterilization of the room then took place.  This took some <br/>
time & the entire time these kids just sat there waiting their turn <br/>
to use the toilet.  It just amazed me that these kids could actually <br/>
just sit there for so long.  I left that school crying & never <br/>
returned to another day care again.<br/>
<br/>
It can really be disheartening to witness such tragedy.  Best of luck <br/>
with supporting your niece & nephew in any way you can.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thankfully, this is the norm in our house too.  18 months ago that wasn&#39;t<br/>
the case.  When we pealed back the layers we realized it was coming from<br/>
TV, PBS kids to be specific.  My girls decided to stop watching on their<br/>
own and literally within 48 hours we had a new house and have never looked<br/>
back.  This programming was filled with sibling rivalry and bullying -<br/>
things that are not in their day to day life (or mine).  We have chosen not<br/>
to put them in the artificial environment of school so it seemed strange to<br/>
bring that environment into our home.  I really have come to believe so<br/>
much of what our society believes about children is just plain wrong<br/>
(sibling rivalry, kids are mean, kids need to be taught, etc.).   I<br/>
realized TV is a &#39;hot&#39; subject on unschooling lists, for me it is not about<br/>
the TV but about coercion.  I would not have forced my children to stop<br/>
watching TV, we talked about what was happening in our home and they came<br/>
up with a solution that worked for all of us.  They continue to watch<br/>
videos of their choice, mostly birth videos and animal videos and play a<br/>
lot of computer games.   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I also wanted to comment on the registering in NC post.  There have been<br/>
too many overzealous DSS cases here for me to consider not registering.  We<br/>
have made choices that many considered &#39;outside the norm&#39; (extended breast<br/>
feeding, co-sleeping, not vaccinating, unschooling, etc ).  While I feel<br/>
these decisions are well researched and the best for my family, I don&#39;t<br/>
want to specifically break a law that might jeopardize my family.  The<br/>
testing requirement goes totally against my beliefs but as I have talked to<br/>
more homeschoolers it seems it really can be handled in a non-threatening,<br/>
no big deal kind of way.  <br/>
