Is the child so isolated that they don&#39;t even let this &quot;friend&quot; ever <br/>
have contact?  If your friend has contact with the child, then there ya <br/>
go - if SHE is aware of physical or mental abuse then she can report <br/>
it. Not letting kids be with other kids and even not letting them have <br/>
books is NOT abuse in and of itself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2142126849">Hi --<br/>
<br/>
You could look up statistics of incidents of abuse in schools. Sadly, the Teachers, School Nurses, Librarians, etc.... often don&#39;t see the abuse in schools. Often the children don&#39;t feel safe telling an adult for fear that the abuse will be worse the next time. <br/>
<br/>
She does have a point, it is the right of every child to be free from Physical/Mental abuse. That is why we are homeschooling. If my child went to our local neighborhood school here in Philadelphia, I guarantee you that she would have very negative experiences. And the Philadelphia SD is notorious for not doing much about abusive situations. <br/>
<br/>
Last year I received a phone call from a mom in Philadelphia who was desperate to pull her 1st grader out of public school. Why? Her poor dd was coming home beaten up and bruised. Who was beating her up? Other 1st graders. What was the school doing about it? Last I heard, they were homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I helped another area mom last year -- she pulled her son out of a &quot;better public school&quot; -- he was in 6th grade and coming home beaten up. Some kids also threatended his life. Was the school willing to do anything about it? No. The mom had a horrible time -- but fortunately now she&#39;s HS&#39;ing.<br/>
<br/>
So, I think that people with such &quot;assumptions&quot; really need to understand that parents have the ultimate right to keep their kid(s) safe from harm, not the government schools. Can abuse happen in the homes of homeschoolers? Of course. But the question also needs to be asked, Can abuse happen in the homes of non-homeschoolers? Of course. Does going to school REALLY protect a child? No. <br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents,<br/>

Hi, Joylyn --<br/>
<br/>
Did she have rotten parents?  Is she reacting to that?<br/>
<br/>
Has she heard urban legends about horrible homeschooling parents and<br/>
does she believe them?  Does she have distorted ideas about how much<br/>
child abuse there is in the world, as opposed to child neglect?<br/>
<br/>
Does deviation from social norms make her nervous?  Would she prefer<br/>
enforced conformity?<br/>
<br/>
I think there is some simplified, &quot;magical&quot; thinking going on in her<br/>
head.  Doesn&#39;t she understand that screening and testing by outsiders to<br/>
check for good parenting can&#39;t be 100% accurate?  Does she understand<br/>
the harm that is done by removing children from decent parents (in<br/>
error) and placing them with strangers in foster care.  Does she think<br/>
that government screening guarantees that temporary guardians will<br/>
always be well behaved and infallibly good to children?  <br/>

To follow this line of reasoning all homes raising children should be <br/>
monitored from the day of birth.  After all, infants and toddlers are even <br/>
MORE vulnerable; not able to talk.  They are also more likely to behave in <br/>
ways that trigger abuse; crying, potty training accidents, etc.<br/>

&quot;Assessment&quot; isn&#39;t stopping abuse for schooled children, it wouldn&#39;t be a <br/>

 </span></blockquote>When I first starting thinking and talking to others about <br/>
homeschooling, I too was concerned about children in isolation with <br/>
no one to help them if they were being abused. I think this is still <br/>
a valid concern for a very small percentage of homeschoolers. School <br/>
can be the best situation for some children and I&#39;ve seen up front <br/>
and personal some of those situations in real life. But, to put it <br/>
in perspective, this isn&#39;t just true for homeschoolers but for all <br/>
segments of the population. It isn&#39;t an education problem at all, it <br/>
is a parenting problem. I&#39;ve talked to grown up children who were <br/>
abused at home and went to school and the abuse still went on and no <br/>
one &quot;saved&quot; them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It seems as though the underlying assumption behind the question is <br/>
that testing is valid measurement of how a child is doing. It seems <br/>
as if the person asking this question isn&#39;t just asking if a child <br/>
is well cared for but also if they are &quot;up to educational <br/>
standards&quot;. That is a whole &#39;nother kettle of fish when talking to <br/>
schoolers: some don&#39;t know what goes on with testing and you need to <br/>
discuss that, some do know what goes on with testing and are happy <br/>
about it because it provides a population their children can show <br/>
superiority over. ;) So I would approach it different ways depending <br/>
on the audience.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d probably start by pricking holes in their assumptions about how <br/>
well schools are doing for their children today.<br/>
<br/>
Alfie Kohn == The Schools Our Children Deserve<br/>
Frank Smith == The Book of Learning and Forgetting<br/>
Steven Harrison == The Happy Child: Changing the Heart of Education<br/>
<br/>
These three books all offer strong arguments for finding good <br/>
alternatives and well researched examples of how schools today are <br/>
not meeting students real needs and how testing is not only an <br/>
invalid indication of competence but counterproductive.<br/>

&quot;In all the discussion about how best to teach children, we don&#39;t <br/>
often hear about the purpose of education other than as a social <br/>
obligation and the preparation of the child for the adult world of <br/>
work. We don&#39;t hear much about the child, and almost nothing *from* <br/>
the child.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps all that education aspires to be is the preparation of the <br/>
young person for their role in the larger society. This is certainly <br/>
a good idea for society, but in the efficiency of producing citizen <br/>
workers, are we missing the deeper meaning and higher purpose of <br/>
learning? Have we forgotten about the spirit of the child, the <br/>
purpose of this one life, the unique and fragile expression of a <br/>
passionate and integrated life?&quot; -- from The Happy Child<br/>
<br/>
Children naturally want to learn, Steven Harrison asserts in The <br/>
Happy Child, so let them direct their own education--in democratic <br/>
learning communities, where they can interact seamlessly with their <br/>
neighborhoods, their towns, and the world at large. Part social <br/>
critic, part humanitarian visionary, Harrison not only describes a <br/>
reorientation of education, but the possibility of rethinking our <br/>
families, our communities, and workplaces, and ultimately what gives <br/>
our children -- and all of us -- real happiness.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-118529042">Wow, the back jacket of &#39;happy child&#39; sounds like a synopsis of one of the <br/>
chapters of &quot;Escape from Childhood: the needs and rights of children&quot; by <br/>
John Holt.  I was just re-reading part of it the other day.  An awesome <br/>
book that helps a body think differently about children and respect (and <br/>
the general lack thereof.)  Unfortunately, it&#39;s out of print so if you see <br/>
one, snap it up!  I think it was written in the late 70&#39;s or early 80&#39;s, <br/>
but maybe it was later still...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1122928669">Thanks, everyone for their replies. I put them all together into my own <br/>
thoughts and hopefully wrote a reply to the list that maybe they will <br/>
read.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; A child who is going to school outside of the home is being assessed<br/>
&gt; &gt; regularly by outsiders -- school teachers, school nurse, librarian etc,<br/>
&gt; &gt; so that is already being done.  Not that these always work but at least<br/>
&gt; &gt; it is something.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Do people like this even listen to themselves when they speak?  <br/>
&gt; Haven&#39;t they<br/>
&gt; read George Orwell?  This is the classic, &quot;I don&#39;t like the way they are<br/>
&gt; doing this and I want the &quot;state&quot; to take care of it.&quot;  If she is <br/>
&gt; convinced<br/>
&gt; of abuse why isn&#39;t she calling social services herself?  Has she <br/>
&gt; spoken the<br/>
&gt; this &quot;friend&quot;?  Actually, none of what the hs family is doing is <br/>
&gt; illegal, we<br/>
&gt; may not like it, it may be wrong but it&#39;s legal.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To follow this line of reasoning all homes raising children should be<br/>
&gt; monitored from the day of birth.  After all, infants and toddlers are <br/>
&gt; even<br/>
&gt; MORE vulnerable; not able to talk.  They are also more likely to <br/>
&gt; behave in<br/>
&gt; ways that trigger abuse; crying, potty training accidents, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Assessment&quot; isn&#39;t stopping abuse for schooled children, it wouldn&#39;t be a<br/>
&gt; magic bullet for home schooled kids either.  All this and the simple fact<br/>
&gt; that it&#39;s wrong to infringe on the liberties of families because of <br/>
&gt; the few<br/>
&gt; who do wrong.<br/>
