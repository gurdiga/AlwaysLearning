&lt;&lt; They had less decay, certainly, but dental decay has been<br/>
found in Neanderthals and all the way back to the Australopithecines, as<br/>
well as in people today who eat an entirely traditional diet.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In India, checking the state of teeth is high on the list of considerations <br/>
for arranged marriages.   And so there are kids who inherit their parents&#39; <br/>
matched sets of &quot;good teeth.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
In India they clean their teeth with sticks from trees.  And because lots of <br/>
them don&#39;t have cavities, people here (being scientific on the first level of <br/>
correlation) make Pelu toothpaste, taking the chemical aspects of those twigs <br/>
and putting them into toothpaste to be used on a toothbrush.<br/>
<br/>
People who won&#39;t use the same water cup twice in a row will use the same <br/>
toothbrush for a year.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it&#39;s nothing about the chemicals in the twigs at all, just that they <br/>
use a different twig each day.<br/>
<br/>
What they do is chew on the end of the stick of not just any tree, but this <br/>
one particular kind, until the end pulps out into a little paintbrush <br/>
softness (not long, just soft) and they use it like a toothpick, sort of, <br/>
rubbing it where food&#39;s collected.<br/>
