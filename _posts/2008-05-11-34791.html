<div id="ygrps-yiv-1723530782">My oldest has a really hard time with playing board games and stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Usually about halfway through the game she gets really down hearted if she<br/>
isn&#39;t in the lead. She is convinced that she isn&#39;t going to win. We can try<br/>
to explain that no one knows who is going to win and even talk to her about<br/>
the fact that many of the games that we play are based on chance.<br/>
<br/>
What can I do to help her?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, she does this with our board games at home (Cootie and Candyland are big<br/>
ones that she does it with) and even with online games as well. With the<br/>
online games she often gets upsets and starts banging things around. I do my<br/>
very best to get to her before the banging (generally speaking she doesn&#39;t<br/>
like me to sit next to her all the time. She hides the screen from me and<br/>
gets embarrassed. I have tried to understand this because she says she knows<br/>
she isn&#39;t going to get in trouble, I think she is just at that giggly stage)<br/>
and am successful most of the time, however even if she doesn&#39;t bang, she<br/>
still gets upset.<br/>

Don&#39;t play board games.  Seriously.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Or play some games without keeping score, just for the fun of the  <br/>
laughter and the activity.   Apples to Apples.  Encore (don&#39;t use the  <br/>
game board).   Thinking Sticks is play just for the sake of playing.<br/>

trouble-=-<br/>
<br/>
Kirby broke a few remote controls when he was little.<br/>
<br/>
It kept him from playing, it made the other kids angry, we weren&#39;t  <br/>
thrilled at needing to spend $20 or $30 to get the game operational  <br/>
again (plus driving to the store at some point).  In our family, that  <br/>
was trouble.  It wasn&#39;t punishment, but it was inconvenience and it  <br/>
was clearly Kirby&#39;s inability to control his emotions and actions.    <br/>
So what is &quot;isn&#39;t going to get in trouble&quot; in your case?<br/>

Oh, I meant she isn&#39;t going to get in trouble for what she is writing.<br/>
<br/>
I am almost embarrassed to say this, but banging the mouse around will get<br/>
her removed, for a very short time, from the computer, until she calms down.<br/>
I usually go sit on the couch with her for a few minutes and she tells me<br/>
about what was frustrating her, so I don&#39;t know that it is exactly<br/>
punishment, but it might seem that way to her.<br/>
<br/>
Here is why banging the mouse is a big deal in our house.<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I are both artists and we have an expensive set up for our<br/>
mouse (which we use all the time). It&#39;s a Wacom tablet and looks like this<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.wacom.com/intuos/4x6.cfm">http://www.wacom.com/intuos/4x6.cfm</a> It&#39;s not something we can afford for her<br/>
(or anyone) to break. We don&#39;t have laptops, so we cant put it on there. We<br/>
have 2 computers. It&#39;s on the dell (because it has to be), which is the<br/>
computer everyone loves to use because it is the better/faster of the two. I<br/>
hope I am making sense.<br/>

<br/>
I really don&#39;t think that having some nice things that you don&#39;t want broken precludes you <br/>
from unschooling.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know a family that has multiple computers and won&#39;t allow their very very computer loving <br/>
daughter to touch them.  Not because she has ever done anything but be gentle (one of the <br/>
most gentle children I&#39;ve ever met), but because they fear that &quot;something&quot; may happen.  <br/>
They will not even sit with her (she&#39;s 3) and do a program for her age because of the fear that <br/>
&quot;something&quot; may happen to their computers.<br/>
<br/>
Your solution sounds respectful of your daughter and your boundaries.  You do what you can <br/>
to set up the situation and then do the best you can.  Ideally, you might manage to get her <br/>
her own computer that doesn&#39;t have such high stakes if something does go wrong.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t see what&#39;s embarrassing about that.<br/>
<br/>
Can you get a cheaper, easier mouse and put that on while she&#39;s using  <br/>
it?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This list is disconcerting me this week, seriously.<br/>
<br/>
Saying yes to a child who wants to use a computer means finding a  <br/>
mouse and a chair she can use, and some games she likes or  <br/>
whatever.   It does NOT mean letting her do whatever she wants to  <br/>
with expensive equipment.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere people are getting some skewed/screwed unschooling  <br/>
information, bringing it to this list, and asking people here to  <br/>
explain or defend it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please try to be clear, anyone, when you say &quot;if this is this....&quot;  <br/>
where you got the original  idea, if you remember.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
