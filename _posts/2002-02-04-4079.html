<div id="ygrps-yiv-553558875">&lt;&lt;I&#39;ve been asked several times to have John Taylor<br/>
Gatto at the conference in SC. I&#39;m afraid it would<br/>
turn into school-bashing---not productive. We all know<br/>
school sucks. (Besides, he&#39;ll be in Atlanta next week<br/>
and I&#39;m going---even though I&#39;ve heard he&#39;s also a bit<br/>
dry).&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My dh & I went to hear Gatto yesterday.  We were very<br/>
impressed.  We found him very passionate & easy to<br/>
listen to.  I was sorry more people weren&#39;t there to<br/>
hear his message.<br/>
