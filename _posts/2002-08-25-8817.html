<div id="ygrps-yiv-928052960">Speaking of coersion.....I am SO guilty of it. How do I stop this? Dh <br/>
said he has no intention of stopping. Ds tries to use it on me and his <br/>
younger siblings. Help!!! Ours is with behaviour issues, though: <br/>
sharing, taking turns, respecting others, etc....not really with the <br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
Love, Marla<br/>
