<br/>
Just something I thought about as you read your note.<br/>
<br/>
To me, unschooling is not a &quot;method of education.&#39;  To me, unschooling is a lifestyle.  I don&#39;t &quot;unschool&quot; during school hours, instead, unschooling is how we live.  It extends to all aspects of life, from sleep to food to tv to computers to vacations to everything we do, how we do it, choices we make as a family.  <br/>

As you are one of the first new members to read the improved and  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-36597506">Well... not answering for Alba who wrote the original post, but who&#39;s to say<br/>
she didn&#39;t do like I did and join a number of groups at the same time to try<br/>
them out.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome Alba.  Here&#39;s what I did.  I was encouraged to try other groups, and<br/>
almost as soon as I joined one, I would find links to others peppered in the<br/>
discussion of those groups and follow them.  That&#39;s something I admire about<br/>
these lists:  they have overlapping audiences and it works fine.<br/>
<br/>
I was pregnant with my only child then with time to peruse some things<br/>
before the little guy arrived.  So I stayed in the idea stage for a long<br/>
while before I started implementing them in our family.<br/>
<br/>
I have learned a lot from this list and Unschooling Discussions and<br/>
Unschooling Basics, all of which have undergone few and minor changes since<br/>
I joined a few years ago.  I still get a lot from other groups like<br/>
Consensual Living which has changed more noticeably and I still find it<br/>
really beneficial to me as an unschooling mom.   Almost immediately after<br/>
joining these groups I started reading Joyce Fetteroll&#39;s site and Sandra<br/>
Dodd&#39;s site and Growing Without Schooling site and Unschooling.info site.<br/>
<br/>
By doing this I came up with a composite of what quite a few other<br/>
unschoolers do in their approach to making the philosophy the basis of their<br/>
family life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-563995576">Alba, I hope you see this before you see the question!  Intros aren&#39;t  <br/>
even requested or encouraged here, so I definitely don&#39;t want people  <br/>
to feel they need to answer why the joined the list.  That&#39;s too much  <br/>
pressure, and it doesn&#39;t matter to me.<br/>
<br/>
The person who asked was curious, but not a moderator or listowner.<br/>
<br/>
I think because my unschooling page is linked lots of places and  <br/>
there&#39;s a way to get on the list from there, lots of people join this  <br/>
early in their search.   I don&#39;t mind.<br/>
<br/>
And asking someone about the new description is like the questions to  <br/>
my kids about whether they like unschooling better than school.  The  <br/>
first time Kirby was asked that he said &quot;I have no basis for  <br/>
comparison.&quot;  I think he was ten or eleven.<br/>

with Alba&#39;s choice, but it&#39;s really not important at all. Never mind  <br/>
