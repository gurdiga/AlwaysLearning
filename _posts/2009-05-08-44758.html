<div id="ygrps-yiv-2085006127">This post is something of a follow up to last week&#39;s discussion under the title &quot;I&#39;ll tell this here, but not on my blog&quot;. It might be off topic; I would say it is an attempt to put the topic of unschooling in a wider context.<br/>
<br/>
My awareness of and interest in unschooling goes back to, I think, 1987, when I first read &quot;Deschooling Society&quot; by Ivan Illich and &quot;Summerhill&quot; by A.S.Neill. From there, I embarked on a journey of discovery, de- / un-schooling myself and, later, my family.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been a member of various Unschooling discussion groups for 2 1/2 years now, which is just about the same length of time that my partner and I have been unschooling our two daughters Sofia (now 5 1/2) and Nora (3). We live in Bilbao, in the Basque country of northern Spain, where there is very little culture of unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
However, my life is bigger than just me, my partner and our daughters. I do lots of other things which I won&#39;t go into here, because you won&#39;t be interested. The point I wish to make is that the principles which inspired my unschooling also inspire the rest of my life. I find it very difficult to understand why anyone would apply their principles to only PART of their life.<br/>
<br/>
One way of putting into words the principle that inspires my involvement in unschooling is &quot;power over oneself&quot; (combined, and I hope this goes without saying, with &quot;respect for others&quot;.) <br/>
<br/>
For me, the difference between unschooling and conventional schooling/parenting is that in conventional schooling or parenting the child is expected to submit to the authority of the parent or teacher, whereas in unschooling we seek above all to give the child _power over herself_ - the power to decide what to learn, how to learn, and when to learn it, but also (in a more radical form of unschooling) what to eat and when, when to sleep and how much, and so on. I hope everyone is with me so far.<br/>
<br/>
This much is already very challenging and incomprehensible to people who are not unschoolers. But there is nothing actually subversive about it. As parents in a Western culture, we basically have complete power over our children, as long as we stick within the law. So we can choose to yield that power to the children themselves - just as other parents (e.g. fundamentalist homeschoolers) may choose to subjugate their children totally, and as long as they remain within the law, we can do nothing about it.<br/>
<br/>
But if we try to apply the same principle to other parts of life, outside the nuclear family, then it does become subversive (and, probably, off topic for this group.) The example which was discussed last week is a case in point. <br/>
<br/>
A teenager is &quot;stopped&quot; by the police and asked whether she has been drinking. If we are to live by the principle of &quot;power over oneself&quot; then this is a most impertinent question. It makes no difference in principle whether the stranger who asks the question is a nosy neighbour or an agent of the state; nor whether the question is posed in a rude or a friendly way. The proper answer is &quot;none of your business&quot;, although it may not be the most tactful one. Other more tactful answers which might satisfy the neighbour would be, for instance, &quot;Yes, plenty, this heat makes me very thirsty!&quot; (playing with the definition of drinking). However, the policeman is not likely to be fobbed off with such a response. If the teenager says &quot;yes&quot;, she resigns power over herself to the state, and is punished. If she says &quot;no,&quot; she is being dishonest, but I would certainly not criticise her for it. (Last week I posted that I would &quot;advise a teenager in this situation to lie.&quot; I now think I was wrong to say that, and instead I would advise her to follow her own conscience, and that I would not judge her for either lying or telling the truth.)<br/>
<br/>
In my view, the most honest and brave response would be &quot;None of your business&quot;. Neither lying nor acquiescing to an impertinent request. This is the path of civil disobedience, but not many people take that path. We choose our battles.<br/>
<br/>
This may seem a trivial situation - but I think it was a good one to discuss because it falls just on the boundary between unschooling and adult life. If we try and live adult life by the principles that inspire unschooling (which I&#39;ve tried to summarise as &quot;power over oneself&quot;), we are continuously going to run up against people who want to have power over us - whether they are our neighbours or those in positions of authority. <br/>
<br/>
Which brings me to &quot;politics&quot;. If you understand politics as being about power, and unschooling to be about giving children power over themselves, then unschooling is political, by definition. <br/>
<br/>
When people talk about &quot;politics&quot; they typically mean party politics and government - which is really a matter of who has power over whom, and what they make them do. But the everyday matter of how we live our lives according to our principles is also political, in the sense that it is about having power over ourselves. When people say &quot;let&#39;s not talk about politics,&quot; what they usually mean is &quot;let&#39;s not question our obedience to those in positions of authority.&quot; I can&#39;t live with a rule like that, and I find it hard to understand how anyone can.<br/>
<br/>
So, with regard to this group, I would suggest that we don&#39;t limit ourselves to applying our unschooling principles purely within the nuclear family, nor our discussions to that context, either.<br/>

<br/>
I think the piece of the puzzle you may be missing is that much of the <br/>
US is heavily dependent on cars for travel.  This includes teens.  <br/>
Point in case, Holly drove to that party.  The police deal with a lot <br/>
of drinking related risk behaviors, including driving under the <br/>
influence.  Here in the US, driving under the influence (DUI) is an <br/>
offense simply because of the loss of lives it incurs.  I don&#39;t know <br/>
the latest statistics.  Here in the US, drinking and driving results in <br/>
a lot of death and serious injury.  That&#39;s why the police officer asks <br/>
questions about drinking.  The point being: does this person need a <br/>
ride, are they a repeat offender who might put their own and other&#39;s <br/>
lives in danger?<br/>

<br/>
This is true of everyone, but unless unschoolers have their children  <br/>
as a high priority, they will neglect them in favor of a bigger life,  <br/>
and that won&#39;t be good unschooling.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If you would read more, I don&#39;t think you would find an example of  <br/>
anyone here applying their principles to only part of their life.   <br/>
Maybe you don&#39;t understand why anyone would not apply YOUR principles  <br/>
to their lives.<br/>
<br/>

involvement in unschooling is &quot;power over oneself&quot; (combined, and I  <br/>
hope this goes without saying, with &quot;respect for others&quot;.) -=-<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t talk about power here much, but we have given our children a  <br/>
life of choices.  It&#39;s not &quot;power,&quot; it&#39;s rational thinking,  <br/>
considering all sorts of factors and preferences.  They don&#39;t need  <br/>
power over themselves.  They need to BE themselves.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/being">http://sandradodd.com/being</a><br/>
<br/>
-=-For me, the difference between unschooling and conventional  <br/>
schooling/parenting is that in conventional schooling or parenting the  <br/>
child is expected to submit to the authority of the parent or teacher,  <br/>
whereas in unschooling we seek above all to give the child _power over  <br/>

to learn it, but also (in a more radical form of unschooling) what to  <br/>
eat and when, when to sleep and how much, and so on. I hope everyone  <br/>
is with me so far.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If by &quot;with you&quot; you mean &quot;understood English,&quot; no problem.<br/>
If by &quot;with you&quot; you mean agree with it all, perhaps some will and  <br/>
surely some won&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The power to decide what to learn&quot; makes a pretzel of the straight  <br/>
line between experience and knowing.<br/>
My children don&#39;t &quot;decide what to learn, how to learn, and when to  <br/>
learn it.&quot;  They learn all the time.  They learn from dreams, from  <br/>
eating, from walking, from singing, from conversations, from watching  <br/>
plants grow and storms roll.   They learn from movies, books,  <br/>
websites, and asking questions.    They eat when they&#39;re hungry (when  <br/>
possible or convenient; I&#39;m making a lunch for Holly to take to work  <br/>
today as she&#39;s working in the flowershop for eight or nine hours, as  <br/>
Mother&#39;s Day is Sunday here.  They sleep when they&#39;re tired, unless  <br/>
there&#39;s something they&#39;d rather do that&#39;s worth staying awake for.   <br/>
They don&#39;t always &quot;decide&quot; when to wake up.  They wake up when they&#39;re  <br/>
through sleeping, or when the alarm goes off if they&#39;ve chosen to get  <br/>
up early, or when I come and wake them up if they&#39;ve left me a note.<br/>
<br/>

in a rude or a friendly way. The proper answer is &quot;none of your  <br/>
business&quot;, although it may not be the most tactful one. -=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Proper&quot; is not a good word to use there.  It might be your preferred  <br/>
answer.   When you say &quot;If we are to live by...&quot; I don&#39;t know whether  <br/>
you mean to co-opt the flighty will of any who read your words, or  <br/>
whether you mean your family.   As the idea of &quot;power over oneself&quot;  <br/>
isn&#39;t one I use at my house, the paragraph wasn&#39;t of value to me.  My  <br/>
children ARE tactful, and they&#39;re friendly, and they are not  <br/>
impertinent.   So far this has served them very well.  If they decide  <br/>
it&#39;s not, they can change course.<br/>
<br/>
-=-(Last week I posted that I would &quot;advise a teenager in this  <br/>
situation to lie.&quot; I now think I was wrong to say that, and instead I  <br/>
would advise her to follow her own conscience, and that I would not  <br/>
judge her for either lying or telling the truth.)-=-<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reconsidering that.   Your revised position is probably  <br/>
true of  most parents of unschooling teens, for whom it isn&#39;t a  <br/>
theoretical future &quot;probably&quot; but is what they&#39;ve already been living,  <br/>
with examples to share, for years.<br/>
<br/>
-=-If the teenager says &quot;yes&quot;, she resigns power over herself to the  <br/>
state, and is punished. -=-<br/>
<br/>
This is quite overstated.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Which brings me to &quot;politics&quot;. If you understand politics as being  <br/>
about power, and unschooling to be about giving children power over  <br/>
themselves, then unschooling is political, by definition. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I understand politics to be about interpersonal relationships.<br/>
<br/>
-=-When people talk about &quot;politics&quot; they typically mean party  <br/>
politics and government - which is really a matter of who has power  <br/>
over whom, and what they make them do-=-<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t a very good definition of politics. It might be common, but  <br/>
it&#39;s not very philosophical or practical.<br/>
<br/>
-=-When people say &quot;let&#39;s not talk about politics,&quot; what they usually  <br/>
mean is &quot;let&#39;s not question our obedience to those in positions of  <br/>
authority.&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
This is rhetoric and nonsense.   And what is usually meant (or rather  <br/>
what you wish us to accept that you believe is usually meant) has  <br/>
nothing to do with this list nor with unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
As to this list when I say, as list owner, &quot;let&#39;s not talk about  <br/>
politics,&quot; I  mean I don&#39;t want to mix the principles of natural  <br/>
learning up with discussions of local homeschooling laws or who is or  <br/>
should be in charge of any governmental agency in any nation  <br/>
represented on the list, nor discuss the push and shove of HSLDA and  <br/>
their increasingly international activities, nor argue about  <br/>
reproductive choices, nor ask people to declare their religious  <br/>
beliefs, nor twist the discussion toward ecology or divide people into  <br/>
pro-wolves-run-wild unschoolers and let-ranchers-protect-cattle  <br/>
unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I can&#39;t live with a rule like that, and I find it hard to  <br/>
understand how anyone can.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Luckily, you don&#39;t live on this list.  You&#39;re welcome to stay, but  <br/>
you&#39;re not welcome to change my intentions.<br/>
<br/>
-=-So, with regard to this group, I would suggest that we don&#39;t limit  <br/>
ourselves to applying our unschooling principles purely within the  <br/>
nuclear family, nor our discussions to that context, either.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the suggestion.  The list has had a focus and purpose for  <br/>
nearly eight years, and has over two thousand addresses on the list,  <br/>
probably half of which are reading and learning from it.   I assume  <br/>
and expect that EVERYone on this list has other sources and outlets  <br/>
for ideas and beliefs.  Some read other lists about dogs, or mental  <br/>
health, or history, or humor.   Many read current events extensively.   <br/>
Some don&#39;t.   This list isn&#39;t intended to be everything to everyone,  <br/>
but a good source of the discussion of unschooling practice and  <br/>
experience.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it can look like that, but making that the goal is confusing  <br/>
and potentially damaging, even without the &quot;above all&quot; (which I think  <br/>
would be a recipe for very anti-social kids).<br/>
<br/>
Clearer is to see our goal as helping them find safe and respectful  <br/>
ways to meet their needs. It not only grows our relationship with  <br/>
them: they see us as someone who wants to help them. But they&#39;re  <br/>
immersed in the process of finding ways to meet needs while also  <br/>
being respectful of others.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So we can choose to yield that power to the children themselves<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We could choose that but I wouldn&#39;t advise it. That&#39;s an idea that  <br/>
has kids up making noise at 2 AM when others are trying to sleep and  <br/>
parents who can&#39;t figure out what they did wrong or how to correct it.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s too much focus in your ideas on power. It&#39;s more helpful for  <br/>
people trying to get unschooling to focus on partnerships, not power.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s very helpful in the process of thinking about unschooling to be  <br/>
aware of power. A parent who is worried that unschooling doesn&#39;t look  <br/>
like school but is putting on a happy face trying to promote  <br/>
unschooling because it sounds good, is wielding a great deal of power  <br/>
without realizing it just because the child inherently trusts the  <br/>
parent. And if the parent is worried, that has enormous power over  <br/>
the child&#39;s choices.<br/>
<br/>
There are other aspects of power it&#39;s useful to be aware of.<br/>
<br/>
But for the purposes of getting and practicing unschooling, it&#39;s far  <br/>
more useful to focus on relationships, not power.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This may seem a trivial situation - but I think it was a good one  <br/>

&gt; as &quot;power over oneself&quot;), we are continuously going to run up  <br/>
&gt; against people who want to have power over us - whether they are  <br/>
&gt; our neighbours or those in positions of authority.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And the focus on power is leading down that thought path.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about helping our kids learn and explore what  <br/>
interests them. Creating a peaceful home will make that a lot easier.  <br/>
It&#39;s not easy helping our kids learn when we&#39;re fretting over chores  <br/>
and family rules and so forth.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers aren&#39;t working toward autonomy or power over self. Those  <br/>
might be useful ideas in some situations, but as overarching  <br/>
principles for unschooling, they&#39;ll lead parents down paths that take  <br/>
them away from unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s vague, I know. (Real examples are more helpful.) But if &quot;power  <br/>
over oneself&quot; is written large as a principle for unschoolers, they  <br/>
won&#39;t see what they&#39;ve done wrong when a child is persuing their  <br/>
needs but trampling all over other people to get them done. There  <br/>
isn&#39;t any guidance in that principle to help the kids exist  <br/>
peacefully in society with others.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If you understand politics as being about power, and unschooling to  <br/>
&gt; be about giving children power over themselves, then unschooling is  <br/>
&gt; political, by definition.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And if you don&#39;t, then it&#39;s not! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about helping them learn and be and meet their needs -- live --  <br/>
in ways that are respectful of others.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So, with regard to this group, I would suggest that we don&#39;t limit  <br/>
&gt; ourselves to applying our unschooling principles purely within the  <br/>
&gt; nuclear family, nor our discussions to that context, either.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We? There is no we. It&#39;s Sandra&#39;s list!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not seeing how a discussion of whether a child should or should  <br/>
not admit to drinking to a police officer as helping a new unschooler  <br/>
let go of worry over math and what to do about the markers being used  <br/>
on the wall.<br/>
<br/>
While that may seem mundane, it&#39;s the foundation of creating an  <br/>
unschooling environment where kids can explore what interests them  <br/>
which is what unschooling is.<br/>

I think some of the difference for me between what you are writing and what I understand about unschooling is the issue of power. I don&#39;t believe I have ever sought above all to give Simon or Linnaea power over themselves. Much of the power that they do have over their lives is because I protect them and because I give it to them, but that power has been more of a secondary effect of working to have a peaceful relationship with them. Unschooling is about trust for me. I trust that learning happens all the time, I trust that Simon&#39;s and Linnaea&#39;s interests are valuable and so I help to facilitate for those interests. The fact that I chose not to put them in school was about not thinking Simon was ready for school and not about power. It was about not wanting to be separated from him when he was 4 and then again when he was 5. It was mutual. It wasn&#39;t power, it was Simon, it wasn&#39;t bigger than us, it was us. <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is a very personal thing to me. It isn&#39;t about bigger things, it isn&#39;t about making the world a better place, it isn&#39;t about bigger things than Simon and Linnaea and David and me. That&#39;s it. And that&#39;s a lot. And it becomes bigger in that ripple effect way, but it begins with us, here and now. <br/>

I want to have a bigger life (I guess I wasn&#39;t born just to have children!), but I also want to share my life with my daughters, to the extent that they want to share it.

&quot;Power over oneself&quot; is only one way of putting this principle into words. Not the only way, not necessarily the best way - just the best that occurs to me at the moment. You say tomato... <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; They don&#39;t need  <br/>
&gt; power over themselves.  They need to BE themselves.<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/being">http://sandradodd.com/being</a><br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But they can&#39;t do that when someone else (teacher, parent) has power over them and wants them to become what THEY want them to be (a doctor, a lawyer...). That&#39;s what I&#39;m getting at. Perhaps someone can put it in a better way.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-For me, the difference between unschooling and conventional  <br/>
&gt; schooling/parenting is that in conventional schooling or parenting the  <br/>
&gt; child is expected to submit to the authority of the parent or teacher,  <br/>
&gt; whereas in unschooling we seek above all to give the child _power over  <br/>
&gt; herself_ - the power to decide what to learn, how to learn, and when  <br/>
&gt; to learn it, but also (in a more radical form of unschooling) what to  <br/>
&gt; eat and when, when to sleep and how much, and so on. I hope everyone  <br/>
&gt; is with me so far.-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If by &quot;with you&quot; you mean &quot;understood English,&quot; no problem.<br/>
&gt; If by &quot;with you&quot; you mean agree with it all, perhaps some will and  <br/>
&gt; surely some won&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is what I am interested in finding out!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;The power to decide what to learn&quot; makes a pretzel of the straight  <br/>
&gt; line between experience and knowing.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>OK, good point. People may decide what to do, what to investigate, but they can&#39;t decide what they will learn - that just comes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My children don&#39;t &quot;decide what to learn, how to learn, and when to  <br/>
&gt; learn it.&quot;  They learn all the time.  They learn from dreams, from  <br/>
&gt; eating, from walking, from singing, from conversations, from watching  <br/>
&gt; plants grow and storms roll.   They learn from movies, books,  <br/>
&gt; websites, and asking questions.    They eat when they&#39;re hungry (when  <br/>
&gt; possible or convenient; I&#39;m making a lunch for Holly to take to work  <br/>
&gt; today as she&#39;s working in the flowershop for eight or nine hours, as  <br/>
&gt; Mother&#39;s Day is Sunday here.  They sleep when they&#39;re tired, unless  <br/>
&gt; there&#39;s something they&#39;d rather do that&#39;s worth staying awake for.   <br/>
&gt; They don&#39;t always &quot;decide&quot; when to wake up.  They wake up when they&#39;re  <br/>
&gt; through sleeping, or when the alarm goes off if they&#39;ve chosen to get  <br/>
&gt; up early, or when I come and wake them up if they&#39;ve left me a note.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. Whereas children who have to get up and go to school, and whose parents make them go to bed the night before, do not have the power to make that sort of choices, or decisions, or whatever you prefer to call them. Children who are forced to sit in class do not have the power to choose to sing, walk, watch a movie or have a conversation.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-If we are to live by the principle of &quot;power over oneself&quot; then  <br/>
&gt; this is a most impertinent question. It makes no difference in  <br/>
&gt; principle whether the stranger who asks the question is a nosy  <br/>
&gt; neighbour or an agent of the state; nor whether the question is posed  <br/>
&gt; in a rude or a friendly way. The proper answer is &quot;none of your  <br/>
&gt; business&quot;, although it may not be the most tactful one. -=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Proper&quot; is not a good word to use there.  It might be your preferred  <br/>
&gt; answer.   When you say &quot;If we are to live by...&quot; I don&#39;t know whether  <br/>
&gt; you mean to co-opt the flighty will of any who read your words, or  <br/>
&gt; whether you mean your family.   As the idea of &quot;power over oneself&quot;  <br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t one I use at my house, the paragraph wasn&#39;t of value to me. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t expect it to be an idea that you use at your house, since I only just came up with that particular phrase, as a way of expressing ideas that I&#39;ve been thinking about for a long time. (Incidentally, do you use different ideas at your house than you use elsewhere?) And the suggestion that I want to co-opt someone else&#39;s will is quite absurd, since I&#39;m clearly talking about exactly the opposite of having your will co-opted. I don&#39;t mean my family, either, since they each have their own conscience and I have mine.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m intending by saying &quot;if we follow the principle...&quot; is that the reader will go along with my train of thought far enough to think about whether they agree with what I&#39;m saying. Of course, a reader who rejects out of hand the principle of having power over themselves (rather than, for instance, considering it provisionally as an admittedly imperfect way of saying something that they might or might not agree with) is not going to go along with me at all.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I shouldn&#39;t have said &quot;the proper answer.&quot; It is certainly the one that springs to my mind when a person asks me an impertinent question. But I&#39;m not usually very tactful.<br/>
<br/>
 My  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; children ARE tactful, and they&#39;re friendly, and they are not  <br/>
&gt; impertinent.   So far this has served them very well.  If they decide  <br/>
&gt; it&#39;s not, they can change course.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure what this has to do with what I said.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-(Last week I posted that I would &quot;advise a teenager in this  <br/>
&gt; situation to lie.&quot; I now think I was wrong to say that, and instead I  <br/>
&gt; would advise her to follow her own conscience, and that I would not  <br/>
&gt; judge her for either lying or telling the truth.)-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for reconsidering that.   Your revised position is probably  <br/>
&gt; true of  most parents of unschooling teens, for whom it isn&#39;t a  <br/>
&gt; theoretical future &quot;probably&quot; but is what they&#39;ve already been living,  <br/>
&gt; with examples to share, for years.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m glad you think so. So how does that square with saying that it is wrong to lie, even in a situation like this (which numerous people on this list have said, unless I read them wrong)? Isn&#39;t that judging the teen for lying, to protect themselves from punishment for having done something that affected nobody but themselves?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-If the teenager says &quot;yes&quot;, she resigns power over herself to the  <br/>
&gt; state, and is punished. -=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is quite overstated.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In what way? I am talking about a teenager being punished for imbibing an alcoholic beverage... not for endangering anyone else by drunk driving (as another poster suggested), or for anything else. I&#39;m not talking about the specific case of what happened to Holly, but about what might happen to any person facing punishment for a &quot;crime&quot; that affects nobody but themselves. It seems irrelevant whether the punishment is a couple of days&#39; probation or five years in jail. Punishment is punishment.<br/>
<br/>
Overstated how?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; -=-Which brings me to &quot;politics&quot;. If you understand politics as being  <br/>
&gt; about power, and unschooling to be about giving children power over  <br/>
&gt; themselves, then unschooling is political, by definition. -=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I understand politics to be about interpersonal relationships.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In that case, of course unschooling is political.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-When people talk about &quot;politics&quot; they typically mean party  <br/>
&gt; politics and government - which is really a matter of who has power  <br/>
&gt; over whom, and what they make them do-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This isn&#39;t a very good definition of politics. It might be common, but  <br/>
&gt; it&#39;s not very philosophical or practical.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Did it seem as if I was putting it forward as a good definition?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-When people say &quot;let&#39;s not talk about politics,&quot; what they usually  <br/>
&gt; mean is &quot;let&#39;s not question our obedience to those in positions of  <br/>
&gt; authority.&quot;-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is rhetoric and nonsense.   <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s certainly rhetoric, but I would disagree that it is nonsense.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And what is usually meant (or rather  <br/>
&gt; what you wish us to accept that you believe is usually meant) has  <br/>
&gt; nothing to do with this list nor with unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do actually think that is what is usually meant. Or maybe better, &quot;If we don&#39;t talk about politics then perhaps it will go away.&quot; However, it won&#39;t. As Marcus Aurelius (I think) said, &quot;Those who don&#39;t take an interest in politics often find that politics takes an interest in them.&quot; We live in interesting times, that is certain.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; As to this list when I say, as list owner, &quot;let&#39;s not talk about  <br/>
&gt; politics,&quot; I  mean I don&#39;t want to mix the principles of natural  <br/>
&gt; learning up with discussions of local homeschooling laws or who is or  <br/>
&gt; should be in charge of any governmental agency in any nation  <br/>
&gt; represented on the list, nor discuss the push and shove of HSLDA and  <br/>
&gt; their increasingly international activities, nor argue about  <br/>
&gt; reproductive choices, nor ask people to declare their religious  <br/>
&gt; beliefs, nor twist the discussion toward ecology or divide people into  <br/>
&gt; pro-wolves-run-wild unschoolers and let-ranchers-protect-cattle  <br/>
&gt; unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Indeed. There are certainly many things in politics which are entirely irrelevant to unschooling, and many others that are not relevant to most people on the list. For that matter, a great many things on this and other unschooling lists are irrelevant to certain subgroups of unschoolers, such as those living outside North America, or unschooling fathers, or parents with young children only (all categories I fall into).<br/>
<br/>
But discussing the principles underlying unschooling, and how to apply those principles both inside and outside our families? Is that irrelevant?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; You&#39;re welcome to stay, but  <br/>
&gt; you&#39;re not welcome to change my intentions.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Only you can do that, of course, but I hope I am allowed to make reasonable suggestions. Thanks for the welcome, anyway. (Does that mean I&#39;m off moderation again?)<br/>
<br/>
I hope nobody is offended by my arguments. The fact that I am still here arguing (despite a frankly hostile reception to some of the things I have said) is sincerely meant as a compliment to the list and some of the people on it. You have influenced me quite dramatically over the past 2 1/2 years, and my family and I have a lot to thank you for.<br/>

A word of warning. What I&#39;ve seen, over the years, is that parents who <br/>
come at this as a political act, as an issue of &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;power,&quot; <br/>
often end up putting their political philosophy above the interests and <br/>
needs of their own children.<br/>
<br/>
The  &quot;lie to cops who ask impertinent questions&quot; position is a good <br/>
example.<br/>
<br/>
Our focus on this list is on the child. Why didn&#39;t she lie? What would <br/>
it mean to her to lie? How would it feel to her? How would she feel to <br/>
be a person who lies? How would it change how friends and coworkers and <br/>
family members feel about her? How would it impact her sense of self? <br/>
How did the whole incident play out that night and in the aftermath, and <br/>
how did a lifetime of unschooling impact that? What was the relationship <br/>
like between parents and between parents and the child during this time <br/>
of stress and a time when conventional parents would probably have been <br/>
throwing blame around, feeling ashamed and angry and punitive? How was <br/>
this different? Why?<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re not interested in debating whether or not the police should have <br/>
the right to ask the question. We&#39;re not interested in debating drinking <br/>
age laws, much less whether there should be governments at all and what <br/>
kind of government.<br/>
<br/>
Robert - you are thinking about things like police power and citizen <br/>
freedoms, but we&#39;re here to talk about living an unschooling life within <br/>
our existing (and quite varied) societal constraints, whatever they may <br/>
be, and in families with widely divergent political, religious, and <br/>
other belief systems. Some of us may live in communes and some in <br/>
socialist countries and some in near-police states. The principles of <br/>
learning that we talk about here are universal, even though our <br/>
particular circumstances might make them more or less difficult to live by.<br/>
<br/>
There are other lists where people talk about politics as they see it <br/>
related to unschooling. Why try to make this list into that? I think it <br/>
is because that is what unschooling is, to you, a political stance, and <br/>
you want to talk us into the &quot;believing in&quot; your political positions. <br/>
Evangelism. We&#39;re not interested, so that&#39;s frustrating, but also a <br/>
challenge. You think you&#39;re doing &quot;good&quot; by trying to persuade us. We <br/>
think that it would do your children good if you&#39;d stop thinking you <br/>
already know so much about what&#39;s good for us and, instead, read and <br/>
ponder the much more mundane real-life day-to-day kinds of issues we <br/>
generally talk about here.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sorry, but you&#39;re jumping to conclusions and this one is dead wrong, which says a fair bit about your prejudices about me.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I started unschooling my kids (rather than just thinking about doing it, and trying to unschool myself, as I had for years) for what I gather to be very typical reasons: because of the confidence I felt in reading about other people&#39;s experiences on lists like this, and because I became only too aware of the damage I had done them by not starting it earlier; and because other things that were happening in my life at the time gave me the confidence to do so.<br/>
<br/>
It happens that I have learned a fair bit about politics by unschooling, because nothing stirs people up like when someone who goes against the flow on principle. But I certainly didn&#39;t start because I felt like going against the system for the sake of it. I don&#39;t need more hassle in my life, and I don&#39;t need to go looking for it. <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I suppose that any activity that takes us away from our children could be construed as putting our own philosophy above the interests of our children. Like spending our time getting into arguments on the internet, for instance... and I am wondering whether this discussion is worth continuing, if people are this prejudiced about what I&#39;m saying.<br/>

Suppose instead of a drink and a couple of days probation, it was some illegal drug and possibly jail time? It&#39;s only a difference of degree.<br/>

the idea that our kids will be in the world when they grow up seems to  <br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s something I wrote in the late 1980s and was put into a  <br/>
collection (not just on webpages, but once on paper...)   It was  <br/>
written in the context of the SCA, but says something I&#39;ve understood  <br/>
about politics for 25 years or so.<br/>
<br/>
An objection to discussing politics on this list is not an indication  <br/>
that I&#39;m vague on what it means, or that I have no political  <br/>
preferences of my own.   My well-considered practice of discussing  <br/>
learning without regard to where a person lives doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m  <br/>
unaware that there are differences in jurisdictions.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve spoken at nearly 40 conferences.   There are always interpersonal  <br/>
and regional politics involved in those situation, because there are  <br/>
limited resources of time and money, and people with different  <br/>
favorite interests.   There are politics in and around the creation of  <br/>
lists and other online resources.   There are motives and purposes and  <br/>
preferences.   There doesn&#39;t need to be drama and intrigue, though,  <br/>
when people are honest and want to help children and parents more than  <br/>
they want to help themselves.<br/>
<br/>
As to ideas like &quot;just rhetoric&quot; or &quot;just semantics&quot; (quoting from  <br/>
many prior discussions, not from this particular one), there is  <br/>
persuasion used to help people understand unschooling, and then  <br/>
there&#39;s argumentative posturing designed to make the writer seem  <br/>
clever or powerful.<br/>
<br/>
And as to semantics, because we&#39;re dealing with words, the better the  <br/>
writing, the easier the reading.  If ideas are fumbled or misstated,  <br/>
it takes a LOT of people&#39;s time and energy (and I woke up this morning  <br/>
thinking I didn&#39;t repair my misspelling of aqua, but...  sometimes  <br/>
there are glitches).<br/>
<br/>
The idea of choices is not the same as &quot;power over oneself.&quot;   Respect  <br/>
isn&#39;t the same as autonomy.   Teaching oneself isn&#39;t the same as  <br/>
learning.  Such discussions sometimes bring clarity to people who  <br/>
didn&#39;t even know they needed it, so I don&#39;t mind them coming around  <br/>
(and coming around again later, and then...  eventually we start  <br/>
giving people webpages of previous good parts).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Excuse me, but I was trying to be as courteous as is possible when people start saying things like I &quot;unschool my children for political reasons&quot; when they don&#39;t know a thing about my motives for doing so. Telling someone they&#39;re wrong, when they are, isn&#39;t discourteous. <br/>
<br/>
If on top of that my responses to such allegations are going to be censored because I&#39;m not &quot;courteous&quot; enough, then, what can I say? It&#39;s not the kind of welcome I usually like to receive.<br/>
<br/>
As for not writing about unschooling, in the present topic I&#39;m talking about what it&#39;s permissible to talk about on this list, and it is marked &quot;Off topic&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
The reason I&#39;m asking is, quite frankly, that I think it&#39;s a waste of my time posting to a list where the decision about what counts as &quot;unschooling&quot; is made arbitrarily according to rules that I don&#39;t really understand. I mean, what part of &quot;Always Learning&quot; is it that I&#39;m not getting? Don&#39;t the wider implications of unschooling count as relevant?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-But I think that a life totally centred on the relationship between  <br/>
&gt; children and parent/s within a nuclear family is not that good,  <br/>
&gt; either. I want to have a bigger life (I guess I wasn&#39;t born just to  <br/>
&gt; have children!)-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You seem to be suggesting that there are people here who were born to  <br/>
&gt; do nothing but have children and they have no bigger life than their  <br/>
&gt; own families. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, I&#39;m not trying to suggest that at all. It was a rather flippant remark. As a matter of fact I don&#39;t think that anyone was born only to have children (if &quot;I was born to do X&quot; has any meaning at all, which I doubt.) But it&#39;s quite amazing what negative connotations people seem to be able to put on phrases that to me seem entirely innocent.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Either you intended to be that insulting, in which  <br/>
&gt; case you probably shouldn&#39;t be here, or you&#39;re totally clumsy with  <br/>
&gt; words and ideas, in which you should read much more and post much less.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Definitely not the former, and I certainly hope not the latter, since writing/translation is actually my current profession (not about unschooling, as yet.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Reading more would have kept you from writing &quot;you can&#39;t ignore that  <br/>
&gt; there is a world out there that your kids will be in when they grow  <br/>
&gt; up.&quot;  That&#39;s in the post that might be voted off the island.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re right, that was a clumsy phrase.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-810732163"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Power over oneself&quot; is only one way of putting this principle <br/>
 </span></blockquote>into words. Not the only way, not necessarily the best way - just the <br/>
best that occurs to me at the moment. You say tomato... &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Many parents come to unschooling and find that first they may want to <br/>
learn how to share power with their children.  The point of calling it <br/>
partnering with our children is that focusing on getting power from the <br/>
state is a whole other issue that we as adults may indirectly influence <br/>
through lobbying, voting and things like that (however that works out <br/>
in Spain and elsewhere).  Probably a major difficulty in coming to <br/>
unschooling is just that: figuring out which choices to allow our <br/>
children to exercise within the protection of the family so that they <br/>
don&#39;t experience the most difficult results of their decision making <br/>
right when they&#39;re just learning how to make decisions.  Children may <br/>
not necessarily value &quot;power over themselves&quot; so much as being able to <br/>
rely on the people in their family for help in growing up, especially <br/>
their parents.<br/>
<br/>
The responsibility to obey laws is not transferable to children but <br/>
given to adults.  Unschooling may have some effect on the law at some <br/>
point but I don&#39;t look for it and it&#39;s not my personal goal because, <br/>
for the most part, I haven&#39;t found myself in disagreement with the law <br/>
where it pertains to me.<br/>

Encouraging our children to lie because we think the law is wrong, that is what I mean by putting our cause above the interests of our children. All your talk is about the law being wrong, but not about what the child is learning or feeling or about the relationship between the child and the parents or other people, etc.<br/>

Look for HEM or AHA yahoogroups lists. I&#39;m not sure which ones are currently active, but the people on those lists tend to get off into politics a whole lot.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-618923782">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I find it very difficult to understand why anyone would apply their <br/>
principles to only PART of their life.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I hope you didn&#39;t get the idea that this is recommended here. My experience <br/>
with this list is encouragment to do the opposite.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; One way of putting into words the principle that inspires my <br/>
involvement in unschooling is &quot;power over oneself&quot; (combined, and I hope <br/>
this goes without saying, with &quot;respect for others&quot;.) &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well I don&#39;t think it does go without saying. The combination of the two <br/>
concepts makes all the difference.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra and others have talked about where the word and idea of &quot;power&quot; in <br/>
itself could be leading down a path that can make unschooling harder, almost <br/>
like a tangent to unschooling. I think I, and maybe more of us here, <br/>
understand what you mean by &quot;power over oneself&quot;. It&#39;s a bit like the word <br/>
&quot;autonomy&quot; discussion so recently canvassed here. You might like to look at <br/>
the archives for that. However if our word choices effect our thinking and <br/>
our communication with others, sometimes it&#39;s better to just let go of a <br/>
word that might be limiting.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I believe by continuing to be attached to the idea of power - <br/>
preserving personal power, giving power to our children, worrying or <br/>
reacting to the perceived or real power that governmental authorities have <br/>
over us, looking at relationships in terms of power - continues to keep all <br/>
kinds of opportunities for conflict in our mindset. By talking to your <br/>
children about &quot;power over oneself&quot; that continues to keep the idea alive <br/>
that they should or must be on the alert for the nebulous or the corporeal <br/>
forces waiting to take it away. It keeps everyone living in a state of <br/>
defensiveness.<br/>
<br/>
That feeling that power must be preserved and protected imbues the &quot;respect <br/>
for others&quot; side of the coin with an &quot;as long as they aren&#39;t trying to <br/>
disempower me&quot; mindset. At least that is what I am seeing could happen. By <br/>
focussing on power, instead of relationships, and preserving power as the <br/>
priority insted of community and the family team, the danger is that you end <br/>
up with &quot;you can&#39;t tell me what to do&quot; being said.<br/>
<br/>
I understand the attraction of offering our children &quot;power over oneself&quot;. <br/>
But having been through that thinking and out the other side, I have learnt <br/>
that keeping any notion of power, even good power, in the thinking <br/>
eventually leads to the ideas of power struggle and resentment over who has <br/>
power in the relationship. This kind of thinking had me on an unpleasant <br/>
stroll down bad childhood memory lane with all the knee jerk emotional <br/>
reactions that old tapes can cause. Keeping my focus on &quot;making concious <br/>
choices now&quot; is better.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; the power to decide what to learn, how to learn, and when to learn it <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is where I see a fundamental schism between different definitions of <br/>
unschooling. Everything that I see from the stories of other long time <br/>
unschoolers whose kids are now grown, from the stories of folks with kids <br/>
the same age as mine, and most importantly from closely observing my own <br/>
daughter is that she never, NEVER, has any reason to *decide* what, how or <br/>
when to learn anything.<br/>
<br/>
That is like saying she would &quot;decide&quot; to breath. To be sure there are <br/>
moments when she plays at holding her breath for some game or swimming, but <br/>
in living her life most of the time she just breathes. In living her life <br/>
and engaging in her passions she just learns.<br/>
<br/>
Automatically, naturally, inevitably.<br/>
<br/>
What I do, and her father does, is help her *do* what she likes to. Provide <br/>
the space, the money (as much as possible), the time, the rides, the <br/>
resources, the other people that *she* judges will help her do what she <br/>
likes to. This includes everything from arranging playdates to joining the <br/>
YMCA for the swimming pool, to staying up late with her, to recording her <br/>
favorite tv shows, to listening to her stories, to reading aloud (she said <br/>
she wants me to read her books to her a couple of times so that it will be <br/>
easier for her when she reads them for herself next time - her spontaneous <br/>
comment.)<br/>
<br/>
I would argue that she has no power to decide what to learn because learning <br/>
is a natural biological process. It will happen. Nor can it be pushed or <br/>
hurried. Many people have told stories of their kids being frustrated with <br/>
themselves because they want to read, but can&#39;t yet developmentally.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore I think you are using the word &quot;learn&quot; here as a synonym for <br/>
&quot;study&quot;. Your kids are very young. I think if you move more towards the idea <br/>
of helping them do what they enjoy, without adding your own value judgment <br/>
to it, you will find that they learn plenty.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; If we are to live by the principle of &quot;power over oneself&quot; then this is <br/>
a most impertinent question. It makes no difference in principle whether the <br/>
stranger who asks the question is a nosy neighbour or an agent of the <br/>
state;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It makes an enormous difference.<br/>
<br/>
Just like it makes a difference if the person asking you a health question <br/>
is a nosy neighbor or your doctor.<br/>
<br/>
You mentioned having &lt;&lt;&lt;complete power over our children, as long as we <br/>
stick within the law&gt;&gt;&gt; Legal questions from police officers about the <br/>
legality of an activity are not impertinent. No-one gets to say that they <br/>
have power over themselves and it trumps the law.<br/>
<br/>
In this country, the USA we have the right to remain silent, and choose not <br/>
to incriminate oneself. It&#39;s the Fifth Amendment to the constitution. <br/>
However that is not the same as saying, &quot;none of your business&quot;. Once the <br/>
police have a warrant or probable cause (in this original party case the <br/>
complaints about noise) it has legally become their business.<br/>

That&#39;s her deciding NOT to breathe.  For fun, or for a challenge.    <br/>
But when it comes down to it, if she can breathe she will.<br/>
<br/>
Last July 24 several families got in on a goof project not to learn.   <br/>
One whole day, learning nothing.   That was a FUN way to see whether  <br/>
people could decide to learn!<br/>
