<div id="ygrps-yiv-588021161">I got three e-mails announcing or promoting a site called &quot;School  <br/>
Sucks.&quot;  they were nearly the same, but not identical, and came to me  <br/>
personally, and as moderator of one yahoo list and owner of another.   <br/>
So I wrote and said it was too negative for my tastes (and I had  <br/>
looked at the webpage too; negative and dark).<br/>
<br/>
The person who had sent those turned out not to be the site owner or  <br/>
podcast-maker, or whatever.  We had a few e-mails back and forth, and  <br/>
then came a wonderfully inept/un-apt analogy.  This is the e-mail I  <br/>
sent back this morning:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
===========================================<br/>
<br/>
-=-You can&#39;t heal a wound by ignoring it, right?-=-<br/>
<br/>
It quite depends on the severity of the wound.<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t heal a scrape by rubbing dirt in it.   You can&#39;t heal a cut  <br/>
by pulling it open every day and looking in there.  If you have bug  <br/>
bites, you could potentially pick and pick and pick at them until you  <br/>
have a roaring infection.<br/>
<br/>
A knife to the abdomen is going to need surgery, and a broken bone  <br/>
needs to be set.<br/>
<br/>
I know school can cause damage.  Living in the past causes damage, too.<br/>
Most wounds can heal themselves if the person is at peace and healthy.<br/>
Natural learning can happen if the person is at peace and healthy and  <br/>
the environment is good for it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying the page shouldn&#39;t exist.  I was asking a question  <br/>
based on the blanket advertising of it, some saying homeschool and  <br/>
some saying unschool, and was explaining why I don&#39;t want to advertise  <br/>
the project on my discussion lists, or link it from my site.<br/>

<br/>
Gradually and consciously.<br/>
I thought about how I learned the things I know.  Sometimes it was in  <br/>
school, sometimes it was despite school, and I thought lovely thoughts  <br/>
about my learning however and wherever it happened.  I learned as much  <br/>
from the backs of cereal boxes as from some of my textbooks, because I  <br/>
really read the whole thing, the whole box, and was thinking while I  <br/>
was reading.<br/>
<br/>
Each time I do something sweet for one of my children, it benefits  <br/>
them, and me now, and me-their-age.<br/>
<br/>
How NOT to recover from school wounds:  Dwell there.  VIsiting a  <br/>
&quot;school sucks&quot; site a time or two might not be bad, but visiting it  <br/>
every day, living there, seems to me a way to let school continue to  <br/>
ruin your life long, long after you are in the real, regular world.<br/>
<br/>
If a single, childless person wants to spend a LOT of energy being  <br/>
negative about school, cataloging school&#39;s ills, revealing and  <br/>
reviewing school damage, then that&#39;s a hobby.<br/>
<br/>
If the parent of unschooled children wants to do that, I think the  <br/>
energy and emotion could be better and more positively spent being  <br/>
merry and light with children who are not in school.<br/>
<br/>
No one can have everything.  You can&#39;t store up and identify with  <br/>
cynicism, pessimism and self-righteous ire and still pour out joy and  <br/>
happiness to your family.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>John Gatto&#39;s first book, his collection of talks called, &quot;Dumbing Us <br/>
Down,&quot; could have been subtitled, &quot;Why School Sucks.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I read it when I was just starting to think about the possibility of <br/>
pulling Roya and Roxana out of school  they were 9 and 6 years old. I <br/>
had been told by lots of people, starting when Roya was in kindergarten, <br/>
that my expectations of school were way too high. I had managed to get <br/>
them into an experimental school that had no textbooks, had multiage <br/>
classrooms, no grades or tests, and tons of experiential learning <br/>
opportunities. The students didn&#39;t have to all do the same stuff at the <br/>
same time - they had &quot;workshops&quot; (stations) set up with lots of <br/>
different things to do in each one. So, for math, for example, they <br/>
could play games, design a board game, do worksheets, play with <br/>
&quot;wrap-ups&quot; or pattern blocks, or put on a &quot;math play,&quot; build a bird <br/>
house, or all kinds of creative things. There were some minimum <br/>
requirements - they had to do something at the reading workshop or <br/>
writing workshop each morning and something in the math workshop each <br/>
afternoon, I think. But how much time they spent on it was up to them <br/>
AND there were lots of other options, too. There were generally about 10 <br/>
different workshops available at any time - like art, music, drama, <br/>
gardening, web design, ...  Reading workshop included listening to books <br/>
on tape - there were big soft pillows on the floor to curl up on. It <br/>
included some games related to books. It included the kids getting <br/>
together and putting on a skit based on a book. It included the game <br/>
they called &quot;hot seat&quot; - one kid would sit on a stool in front of some <br/>
other kids and would take on a character in a book - the other kids <br/>
would ask questions and the kid on the hot seat would answer as the <br/>
character. The other kids would try to guess who she/he was. It really <br/>
was, looking back, a rather amazing school with the cream-of-the-crop <br/>
teachers. Generally, the kids seemed to have a good time with the <br/>
activities. I spent a lot of time in the classrooms and, especially for <br/>
the younger kids, it really was fun. There were no grades - the teacher <br/>
walked around helping kids with their activities and writing little <br/>
notes to herself on post-its. The notes were about what she observed the <br/>
kids doing and learning. A note might say, &quot;RS leadership org games&quot; -- <br/>
meaning Roya Sorooshian was showing her leadership skills by organizing <br/>
other kids in playing games. Throughout the day, she&#39;d put all the <br/>
post-it notes for each kid on papers and put them into the file folder <br/>
she kept for each kid. When it was time for parent-conferences, she&#39;d <br/>
use those post-it notes to do a write-up about each student - talking <br/>
about what they&#39;d learned, what kind of learning style they seem to <br/>
exhibit, etc.<br/>
<br/>
And yet, in spite of having gotten my kids into what seemed like an <br/>
almost too-good-to-be-true school, I was never satisfied. There was <br/>
always something going on that bugged me. They got a student teacher in <br/>
Roxana&#39;s class and changed the usual set up so that he could do practice <br/>
lessons with the whole class. They were awful and frustrating. They had <br/>
a time after lunch every day when the teacher read out loud to the class <br/>
- they were reading the Goosebumps books every day, week after week, and <br/>
Roxana was not enjoying them at ALL. The library/media center teacher <br/>
wouldn&#39;t let the kids in the lower grades get books from the shelves <br/>
intended for the older grades. They had computer time once a week in the <br/>
media center and it was run by the media center teacher who was <br/>
extremely controlling and made them do everything step-by-step as a <br/>
whole class. They tested my kids for the gifted program, without asking <br/>
me, and<br/>
<br/>
So - although a lot of what Gatto talked about in Dumbing Us Down didn&#39;t <br/>
apply to the school experience my kids were having at that time, some <br/>
did. And, I had a very very strong reaction to it, in relation to how <br/>
&quot;I&quot; had felt in school and what school had done to me. Once I&#39;d read <br/>
Dumbing Us Down, I just coudn&#39;t not see the problems with school. I felt <br/>
compelled to get my kids out.<br/>
<br/>
So - I think there is good reason to write (and read) about how school <br/>
sucks. It can help someone decide to get their kids out of school, and <br/>
it can inform their homeschooling choices once they have pulled their <br/>
kids out.<br/>
<br/>
But then - move on. I remember that I compared homeschooling to school a <br/>
lot in the first year of homeschooling, but I haven&#39;t done that in <br/>
years. How we lived was completely unrelated to school and no longer in <br/>
reaction to school, once I&#39;d gotten a good grasp of unschooling. I&#39;ve <br/>
seen John Gatto speak several times since then and I find what he talks <br/>
about almost completely irrelevant to our lives. I have to remind myself <br/>
that his critical analysis of schooling is probably still meaningful to <br/>
others. He&#39;s clever in how he talks about it and creates some good <br/>
images of what school is like (fleas in a can with a lid that doesn&#39;t <br/>
let them jump as high as they can) and I can see how it might really <br/>
help someone feel more confident in their choice to get their kids out <br/>
and to not recreate school at home.<br/>
<br/>
But, once you&#39;ve decided to unschool, you&#39;ll get more out of thinking <br/>
about learning, rather than schooling, and about how your kids can learn <br/>
in the whole real world, rather than how their learning is stunted in a <br/>
classroom.<br/>

<br/>
I didn&#39;t send Chamille to school because I realized that it sucked.  It was a series of revelations for me that I couldn&#39;t ignore, so I found homeschooling and quickly found unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I compared homeschooling to school a lot for a long time.  It seemed so big and relevant.  Then, when Chamille was about 9 or 10, I stopped reading the local homeschool boards and focused more time on reading only about unschooling.  That&#39;s when my focus changed greatly, from what we weren&#39;t doing, to what we were doing.  <br/>
<br/>
I still can&#39;t read local homeschool boards, they are full of fear, negativity, judgement, and cynicism.  I occasionally check one list to keep abreast of local laws to know when I need to send a letter to a senator.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s good to have solid reasons for why one is choosing an alternative to regular schooling, it&#39;s even better to not live there and know good solid reasons why you do what you do that is FOR something rather than AGAINST something.  This is something that I see in my oldest daughter these days more and more, her positive optimism towards something more than her negative opposition against something.  She does both for sure, but she leans heavily towards the optimism forward part of life and I can directly link that to the general attitude in our house because we stopped going against things and went toward things as a family.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-942219356">School doesn&#39;t always suck. For me, that&#39;s the crux of it. I didn&#39;t like<br/>
school through 12th grade. I liked it a little more (not much) once I went<br/>
to community college. Then years later, I chose a college I wanted to go to<br/>
and it was wonderful, and then later I transferred to a different school, a<br/>
university, which I absolutely loved.<br/>
<br/>
If a child is being unschooled or even being schooled with a great deal of<br/>
choice involved, then anytime a child has school WITH choice, it doesn&#39;t<br/>
necessarily suck. And anybody can do at least a certain amount of that.<br/>
<br/>
One of my friends is very pro-school (she worries about my unschooling), and<br/>
when my friend&#39;s two youngest children &quot;dropped out&quot; of high school, she let<br/>
them do a lot of things that didn&#39;t interfere with what they wanted. She<br/>
also didn&#39;t even bother to think of herself as a homeschooling mom because<br/>
she is so pro-school, it didn&#39;t compute. So they continued being themselves<br/>
and learned what they wanted to, went to work at young ages, lived with<br/>
their parents and got a GED when and if they wanted (not sure if the<br/>
youngest has a GED yet and he&#39;s 19 or so). At this point, at least three of<br/>
her kids have &quot;some college.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The point being, you don&#39;t even have to be an unschooler and can be very<br/>
pro-school, and yet view school as a personal decision. Yes, school is<br/>
compulsory and yet even pro-school parents find ways to deal with that fact<br/>
that don&#39;t overwhelm their kid&#39;s ability to do at least some of what they<br/>
want.<br/>

Every time I prevent something damaging happening to one of my children, it&#39;s like healing a little bit of me.  Every time I help my children achieve something wonderful, it&#39;s a little bit like healing that little girl that would&#39;ve like that to happen for me!  I love gifting my kids with that!

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1782483247">You know I sort of thought that I didn&#39;t have a lot of school damage. I thought I&#39;d dealt with most of the things that had made me feel small or less than in school. I knew there were things like high waders, trousers that don&#39;t go down far enough, that always disturb me. Both Simon and Linnaea are absolutely nonplussed by the length of their trousers, but my rapid growth rate in junior high was such that I was an easy target for comments at a time when I wanted to just fade in to the background. So there is a mixture of horror and envy as I see them comfortably wearing trousers that don&#39;t even brush the tops of their shoes. But I thought that I&#39;d largely moved on from carrying my school baggage. <br/>
<br/>
I got a ukulele a week or so ago. Now I had a range of musical lessons as a child. Piano, privately, and violin and oboe, via school, and I think that covers it. My parents firmly believed that the ability to play an instrument was important to being a well rounded individual. I failed at every turn. I hated practicing the piano, however long I had to practice every day. My brother would help me lie to my parents about how much I played, and we even taped a practice session so that my mom could hear me play if she was upstairs working when I was supposed to be practicing. I didn&#39;t want to play violin, I wanted to play fiddle, so I was seriously disappointed with the whole thing and the oboe was just me being different from all the girls who were playing flute instead, like the German classes instead of French. As an adult I&#39;ve tried the guitar more than once, I have a keyboard upstairs that I got a few songbooks for and, well, I just didn&#39;t stick to any<br/>
 of it. And I knew that it was because I wasn&#39;t musical. I&#39;m just not well-rounded. <br/>
<br/>
So I got this ukulele, another in a series of musical whims, and I opened the box and I couldn&#39;t for the life of me figure out why I&#39;d gotten it. I had no vision of me playing a ukulele, I had no songs, particularly that I wanted to learn. I&#39;d just a song on youtube that a friend posted on facebook and I got hooked on the idea of a ukulele. So I got this ukulele and I have no expectations from it, but I am enjoying it like I&#39;ve never enjoyed an instrument before. It is quick to learn, and that helps, I get distracted more easily on something with a steep learning curve. And I set a couple of minor goals, like playing Happy Birthday to You for my mom&#39;s 70th birthday via flashdrive. And then I explored, via the internet, what I could learn. I can play, not totally smoothly, but a bit, Ukulele Lady and I&#39;m working on Mairzy Doats. <br/>
<br/>
I have no expectations of what this little stringed thing is going to do for me. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll me more or less rounded if I play the ukulele. I did, however, mention it to my dad yesterday, and he completely brushed it off as being a non-instrument. The disdain wasn&#39;t that obvious, but I am sensitive enough to have felt at least a passing sneer. It&#39;s totally possible that I will learn a few songs and then it will go to gather dust like the other instruments in our house do. But this little ukulele has done for me what none of the stuff that I did as a child ever did, nor what my ranting and raving about my school experiences did. It has let me see how much I enjoy making music. And I enjoy the intellectual pursuit of the skill of making music. I like looking for different strumming patterns, I like practicing barre chords and feeling the ache in my hand as the muscles stretch to reach. I like listening to others explain how to do something or other<br/>
 and being able to move away if they get too boring. I like going at my own pace. I like looking to no one else to define my relationship with music via the ukulele. <br/>
<br/>
So that&#39;s part of how I heal from school damage. I enjoy my life doing things that I couldn&#39;t do through school. <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1734768322">== School doesn&#39;t always suck. ==<br/>
<br/>
I hate the thought of school. However, when I really think about it, I didn&#39;t hate everything about school. I have very fond, if not clear, memories of Montessori School. I have good memories of early elementary school, up until around 4th or 5th grade (prepubescence?). I absolutely loved college. <br/>
<br/>
I was miserable in between. That had more to do with the social aspects of school than the educational. I liked doing schoolwork as long as it didn&#39;t involve writing a paper. The social structure affected my learning and my confidence. I can look back now and see how all the structured education stifled my individual creativity and passion, though. I&#39;ve lost a lot of that and am having a hard time getting it back.<br/>
<br/>
There are people who come out of school and have been able to retain that passion and creativity.<br/>

<br/>
I used to be like this. I think I learned it from my dad, who always seemed to be angry or annoyed with someone or something. He taught me to never trust anyone. Because of that, I spent a majority of my life feeling pretty miserable. Now I make a conscious effort to find things I like with everything that I can. I try to find the positive in any situation. I think and talk about things that I like rather than things that I dislike because I don&#39;t want my children learning how to make themselves feel as miserable as I did.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not to say that I ignore it when something makes me feel bad. I don&#39;t dwell on it and make sure everyone else knows how angry or miserable or annoyed I am.<br/>

***I don&#39;t understand this. Better to not live where? Better to not know solid reasons why you do what you do? Clarify, please. ***<br/>
<br/>
I have been inundated with article after article of the &quot;ills of public school&quot;.  I don&#39;t know why, but they&#39;ve been circulating around in various forums that I frequent.  They are interesting to read.  I usually read them.  If they are too negative and redundant I&#39;ll stop before I get halfway through.<br/>
<br/>
I KNOW what&#39;s wrong with public school!  It&#39;s good to know if you are going to make an informed decision to not send your kids there!<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s even better is to KNOW what is right with unschooling!  That is where I need to live so that I can focus more clearly on the next happy thought and the next happy interaction with my kids.  If I live in the land of &quot;school is bad&quot;, I don&#39;t have a stepping point to move away from it.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I meant when I said that.  I like TED talks <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ted.com/">http://www.ted.com/</a><br/>
What I like is how the ideas are categorized on the left hand side of that page.  That&#39;s what it&#39;s about, ideas, but what I find wonderful is that they are listed as: persuasive, courageous, ingenious, fascinating, inspiring, beautiful, funny, innovative.  That&#39;s how I like my unschooling info buffet to look like!  Those are all really positive ways to view ideas.  You don&#39;t see negative descriptors listed there!  That doesn&#39;t mean that I don&#39;t occasionally enjoy a nice school rant here and there, but mostly I like to be inspired by ideas rather than be heart broken.<br/>

<br/>
Beautiful, Jenny.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, that.<br/>
<br/>
Will you live in the dark, stinky alley in the shadow of school where  <br/>
there is moaning and wailing and gnashing of teeth?  That is not the  <br/>
substance of school.  There&#39;s a brighter side, just over the building,  <br/>
where more positive people are finding ways to cope with it, or where  <br/>
kids are relieved to have a better place than their particular home to  <br/>
hang out with people who have ideas, and who smile.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s better to turn away from the school, step out of the  <br/>
shadow of the school, and live a whole new way.  An insipiring,  <br/>
enjoyable way (lifting words form what JennyC wrote above).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the difference in cup half full of seething, horrible memories  <br/>
(or overflowing with them, if you add other people&#39;s memories before  <br/>
you&#39;ve processed your own), and cup half full of gentle new ideas,  <br/>
which can easily overflow if you let it.<br/>
<br/>
That whole cup half full, cup half empty metaphor is about pessimism  <br/>
and optimism, about lack and abundance.  But there&#39;s more than one way  <br/>
to look at it, and that&#39;s the topic of the chat later today.<br/>

As time went on and I thought of what my kids were missing (good or  <br/>
bad), it started to seep in, for me, the kind of damage that&#39;s done  <br/>
even to kids who are successful in school, and because my own nature  <br/>
isn&#39;t competitive and I regret every time I was immature and rude as a  <br/>
kid, I think of kids who would have LOVED to have come in first on  <br/>
something, when I came in first and thought nothing of it, it was so  <br/>
routine.  Or when I got an A, but it meant someone else didn&#39;t,  <br/>
because only so many were allowed.<br/>
<br/>
If I could go back and do school again, I think I would aim for low  <br/>
B&#39;s, not maximum A&#39;s.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-58637068">And I have to say that for some school can be a blessing and a safe place.<br/>
My neighbours do not treat their 4 year old well at all . Its really sickining but not unlawful so nothing I can really do other<br/>
than make comments and try to say things about how talking to him differently is good.<br/>
hoiw he is a good kid that only wants to do things to help or how important it is to really listen to him.<br/>
Its a very sad situation.<br/>
In this case I am really glad the child goes to day care/pre-school.<br/>
He may have someone there that listens to him, encourages him and treats hiim better than his parents do.<br/>
Some households are really bad and kids are better off in school.<br/>
My mom tells me about a teacher she had as a child that really helped her cause she was always put down at home.<br/>
It really was a safe haven for my mom to go to school and not be home where her parent were always fighting.<br/>
My mom became a teacher.<br/>
Like it was discussed here not everyone can or should unschool.<br/>
