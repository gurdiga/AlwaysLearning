<div id="ygrps-yiv-1602124257">Hi everyone, I have not posted here in some time. I&#39;ve been over at<br/>
RUN often. I need advice with my 7yo. son. For a long time now he gets<br/>
very upset whenever another kid looks at him. Girls that is! In the<br/>
past when we took him to the playground and he &quot;freaked out&quot; if other<br/>
kids were there. I would honor his feelings,ask him if he wanted to<br/>
leave or keep him near me. Sometimes,slowly,he would get used to them<br/>
and join in play. He gets extremely upset if a girl looks at him. Like<br/>
today in Bealls,he was in the cart and a girl came around the aisle<br/>
and he stood up and yelled: She&#39;s looking at me!! I held him and said<br/>
&quot;it&#39;s okay&quot; and she left and he was glad. Later,I asked him what he<br/>
doesn&#39;t like and he only said girls looking at him. I told him people<br/>
look,that he looked at her right? She&#39;s not going to hurt you. He<br/>
doesn&#39;t offer up much info but i did ask him what we can do to help<br/>
him and he says keep them away. I said they do have a right to walk<br/>
around the store.A few years back we were at the park with my friend<br/>
who has two little girls and one walked up to him and hit him so he<br/>
now has a fear of that happening again.I said it&#39;s probably not going<br/>
to happen again,trying to reassure him.<br/>
My Husband thinks he needs MORE exposure to kids and said even if we<br/>
left him alone with some. Do you think i need to bring him around lots<br/>
more kids,more often? In the past it&#39;s been like okay you don&#39;t like<br/>
being around kids so we won&#39;t do that but now i wonder if the approach<br/>
was wrong.His friends have all been boys.</div>

 </span></blockquote>My thoughts:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Try not to make a big deal out of the situation (in your mind, and with your son), and <br/>
have confidence that it will resolve.  I doubt whether he will go off to college hating girls!  <br/>
LOL<br/>
<br/>
2.  Don&#39;t try to immerse him in girls against his will!<br/>
<br/>
3.  Role play so that you can help him find ways to react that will be more respectful of the <br/>
girls he encounters.<br/>
<br/>
My dd had a friend, when she was 5, who had no use for boys because of the same <br/>
experience your son had.  She was not very nice to my son for a long time, but we kept <br/>
working on it because she wanted to come over to play with my dd.  We lived quite a <br/>
distance apart, so playdates alone were rarely an option in our case.  She finally tolerated <br/>
his presence, and now she considers him one of her good friends, and he&#39;s always invited <br/>
to her birthday parties.  I remember when she said, &quot;Hey, some boys aren&#39;t that bad.&quot;  It <br/>
was a milestone, but it took about 2 years.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1514912313">I think you shouldn&#39;t force the issue or make a big deal out of it in<br/>
your own mind.  It&#39;s common for many kids.  Karl isn&#39;t like that at 5<br/>
but I was.  Of course I was going to kindergarten so I didn&#39;t have any<br/>
option but to be around kids I didn&#39;t want to be around.  One cute kid<br/>
(somehow a picture was taken .. dunno how) declared himself my<br/>
boyfriend and I wanted absolutely nothing to do with him!  I<br/>
distinctly remember outside at recess he marched around the basketball<br/>
court with a little troupe of boys behind him while holding a broom<br/>
before him (used to knock a stuck basketball out of the hoop) and at<br/>
the top of his lungs shouted &quot;I&#39;m gonna marry you!&quot; over and over<br/>
again.  I was so annoyed and exasperated, and that&#39;s why I have such a<br/>
clear memory of it.  He liked me and I wasn&#39;t ready for boys to be<br/>
paying attention to me.<br/>
<br/>
Now I look back and it&#39;s a fun little episode in my very young life.<br/>
<br/>
And I had totally got over my aversion by the time I was 11 or so.<br/>
