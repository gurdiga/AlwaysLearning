<div id="ygrps-yiv-2082109835">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I think we were just waiting for you ;)<br/>
Jacki&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;******No one sees the irony of this? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You have taken Jacki&#39;s comment out of context.  She was not replying to<br/>
*Re: HEMs response to my complaint*  as you suggest by your subject line.<br/>
(which I&#39;ve changed)  <br/>
She was responding to Sandra&#39;s post #20663 in which Sandra asks that her<br/>
list remain an unschooling list and not be turned into a &quot;kids in public<br/>
school&quot; list or a &quot;which candidate to vote for list.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Jacki was using humor to lighten the situation a bit and most people were<br/>
able to tell by her use of the little winky.  ---   ;)  ----<br/>
<br/>
***Nor the fact that I have posted a challenging concept to the status <br/>
quo about &quot;unschoolers&quot; succumbing to school without anyone being <br/>
willing to comment until we &quot;wait for Sandra&quot; to weigh in on it? ***<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not going to help anyone on this list if you take personally a lull<br/>
in posting .   There might be many reasons you haven&#39;t received a<br/>
response to your post but taking Jacki&#39;s comment out of context and<br/>
supplying some sinister meaning of your own isn&#39;t one. <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps your post didn&#39;t speak to the majority of the people here. <br/>
Perhaps people are still considering it and are formulating a response. <br/>
Perhaps people are busy and don&#39;t have time to read and reply to every<br/>
topic.   Perhaps they&#39;re way ahead of you, have considered these things<br/>
and don&#39;t feel the need for further discussion.  <br/>
<br/>
Post something else if you think you can contribute more to the ideas<br/>
you&#39;ve already expressed and maybe you&#39;ll spark someone&#39;s interest.  <br/>
<br/>
***Can we just discuss the IDEAS, without waiting to be told how and <br/>
what to think? That is the point! Model thinking, not following! But <br/>
step gently on that trap door....THINK WITH YOUR OWN MIND!***<br/>
<br/>
We discuss ideas here all the time and the idea you have that anyone here<br/>
is waiting to be told how to think is wrong.   If you think that badly of<br/>
your fellow list members you won&#39;t be able to contribute as positively to<br/>
the list as you otherwise might.   I hope you reconsider. <br/>
<br/>
I was an attachment parent before I ever heard the name Sandra Dodd.  My<br/>
son chose to stay out of school before I ever heard of unschooling or<br/>
Sandra.    <br/>
<br/>
When I did read her articles I was pleased to find someone who had a<br/>
talent for sharing well thought out ideas and I felt relieved there was<br/>
someone out there, even if I didn&#39;t know her, who shared some of my<br/>
philosophies .    I have learned a lot from Sandra but I&#39;ve learned even<br/>
more from my son.   If I *am* a follower, I follow him. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As to your post regarding the reasons some kids might choose school, I<br/>
think I know what you&#39;re trying to say.   Some kid might still think<br/>
school is the best way to learn because there is still some residual<br/>
school think in the mind and language of his  parents leading him to that<br/>
conclusion.  Parents do have a responsibility to turn off the school<br/>
background noise if they want their kids to be able to do it.   Of<br/>
course, some kids choose school for other reasons.   There is a point<br/>
along the unschooling path where people can see all things within the<br/>
context of unschooling and use the parts of those things as they like and<br/>
in ways that will benefit them.  If you&#39;ve never read Kelly Lovejoy&#39;s <br/>
&quot;The Three Stages of Unschooling&quot; you might enjoy it.  I think it&#39;s at<br/>
Sandra&#39;s website.  <br/>
<br/>
But as far as an unschooled child choosing school,  I have no experience<br/>
with that.  Because Dylan has never been to school, he has never thought<br/>
school was the place for learning.   Because he&#39;s never used a curriculum<br/>
he never thinks the best place to get information or knowledge is a text<br/>
book.    In fact he doesn&#39;t say &quot;I want to learn about (blank)&quot;  at all. <br/>
  He&#39;s not seeking out learning opportunities, he&#39;s living and doing the<br/>
things he&#39;s interested in.  <br/>

<br/>
Put me in the second category.<br/>
<br/>
As I was reading, I thought a bit about posting about how ISPs create a kind of ghettoized communtiy that is only for members.  I wish that these people felt empowered to join me in creating more free flowing community that didn&#39;t impose requirements of registration and work samples.<br/>
<br/>
But I felt my idea wasn&#39;t fully developed, and was likely to hurt some people&#39;s feelings.<br/>
