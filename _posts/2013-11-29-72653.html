<div id="ygrps-yiv-2020528973">Thank you all very much. I am reading this mailinglist since 2009, but  <br/>
I have to say - it was the reading of Sandras Big Book (after of  <br/>
course reading for years her webpage) that really clicked with me. No  <br/>
idea what the difference is for me between the web page and the book.  <br/>
And I certainly still use the webpage, but eye-opening, life-changing  <br/>
was for me the book. Thank you Sandra also for that.<br/>
<br/>
Greetings from Italy, Tania</div>
