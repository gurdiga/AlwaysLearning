&lt;&lt; <br/>
 These are such small parts of our day.  Maybe this is all I should be <br/>
 expecting???? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my advice Pat. Quit expecting.<br/>
This comes from someone that has had/is still having some of the same <br/>
struggles you are. I am learning slowly that the &quot;not expecting&quot; takes a lot <br/>
of pressure off of any particular situation. Because I am more open to <br/>
whatever comes out of it instead of attaching my preconceived notions.<br/>
If you&#39;re open to the natural flow, it can lead to great things.<br/>
If your kids feel prodded and poked, or like you think their activities are <br/>
unworthy, or that you&#39;ll possibly end an activity...they aren&#39;t going to have <br/>
that nice bubbly flow in which great things can happen.<br/>
Learning doesn&#39;t always happen in big, magic swathes.<br/>
Sometimes it&#39;s just a little moment, spent in the garden with Mom. And it <br/>
gets connected to some other piece of information at a future date and slowly <br/>
becomes something more and more meaningful to the child.<br/>
Expectations are colored.<br/>
And not the best way to get a joyful unschooling feeling going.<br/>

&lt;&lt; That brings up a good point.  I guess I am thinking of the deadline <br/>
 of college or a vocation or what ever the child chooses.  Does it <br/>
 matter if they are ready for this at 18 or 20, no.  Does it matter if <br/>
 it is 25, yes.  How do you feel about this? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Deadlines in terms of age are false. Very school mentality in my mind.<br/>
If my child finds work he/she enjoys at age 14, 17, 25 whenever, I would be <br/>
supportive.  I don&#39;t think a child free to follow their interests and use <br/>
their natural ability to learn is going to have a problem finding work they <br/>
enjoy.<br/>
Do we have to know what single vocation we want to do by a particular age?   <br/>
What about people that have several vocations in a lifetime.<br/>
I&#39;ve had jobs in several different fields and I plan to go to Massage Therapy <br/>
school next year.  Should I have figured this out a long time ago? At age 18 <br/>
when I was going to the Int&#39;l. Air Academy? <br/>
Why?<br/>
All of the work experience I&#39;ve had up till today has been valuable..just as <br/>
the time I&#39;ve spent not working, running my own business or taking classes.<br/>
Why does life have to be looked at in such a small box? Graduate at 18, go to <br/>
college, get a job....BLAH!!<br/>
There are no rules.<br/>
A person should follow their heart, follow their interests and let that lead <br/>
them to work they will love. Without age restraints or the idea that we must <br/>
choose a single vocation or career.<br/>
Be free!! Think free and you will see that those ideas are limiting.<br/>
