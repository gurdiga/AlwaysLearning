 </span></blockquote>We took 1st son from Texas to CA when he was 6 months old. Two nights on<br/>
the train in chairs. It was long but I was only 24 so handled it better<br/>
than I would now. Of course the damn train caught on fire and we ended up<br/>
in the middle of the desert for about 6 hours. I quickly got over the<br/>
thought it might be safer to travel on a train:)<br/>
BUT I can say for sure it has to be better than the train journey my mom<br/>
and I took 2 night ago. We were in Paris and had to get back to Amsterdam<br/>
so got on the overnight train complete with about 400 backpackers. When the<br/>
hell they decided to pack 6 bodies into a sleeper compartment I don&#39;t know<br/>
but each &quot;bed&quot; was like a coffin with no where to stand up. We lay there<br/>
tossing and turning (between heat and pregnancy I was totally<br/>
uncomfortable) for 8 hours while the 4 young people slept like logs. I felt<br/>
incredibly old.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway Shyrley I would say go for it but take valerian for all of you -- or<br/>
get a little compartment if you can.<br/>

think it was about 1973.  At *that* time, the seats were really <br/>
comfortable.  They could lean almost all the way back without interfering <br/>
with the person behind.  And they had a footrest that came up to make it <br/>
almost like a bed.  Even with it all the way open like that, there still <br/>
would have been room to put a toddler in front of the seat on the floor.  I <br/>
have no idea what they&#39;re like now.<br/>
