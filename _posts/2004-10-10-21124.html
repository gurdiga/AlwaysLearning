<div id="ygrps-yiv-625664930">This thread regarding equality threw me for a loop. I couldn&#39;t figure out<br/>
where it came from or why. So I&#39;ve just been pleasantly reading and getting<br/>
some interesting insights. I think I figured out that the origin has<br/>
something to do with<br/>
someone getting pissed about how they were responded to and held the flag of<br/>
equality, stating their unhappiness with how unequal things were on the<br/>
list, or maybe how unfair, or maybe both. Just a guess.<br/>
<br/>
In any case it does bring me to something I&#39;ve wondered about.<br/>
<br/>
Do any of the long-term members on this list still look to get advice here?<br/>
Or do you take more of a &quot;teacher&quot; role in your approach, reading to see how<br/>
you can help, but not really looking for advice?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sometimes I&#39;ll ask for advice on specific things (suggestions for books or<br/>
movies that tie in with a new interest, sources of one thing or another).<br/>
<br/>
More often, I don&#39;t have a known need to ask advice on parenting or<br/>
unschooling as our family&#39;s lives are pretty smooth and trouble-free with<br/>
both. I&#39;m always open to good ideas, and those come up on this list with<br/>
regularity -- so even if I don&#39;t think to ask for advice, I do receive. ;)<br/>
<br/>
I also have two quite intimate groups of women friends and if I&#39;m having<br/>
problems in life, I tend to ask them -- I already know them well and they<br/>
know me and my family well and we&#39;re all on the same page of<br/>
unschooling/respectful parenting.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I learn best by trying on a different point of view and explaining a concept<br/>
in a way that someone who is coming from that point of view can (hopefully!)<br/>
understand. So everytime I answer a question I&#39;m learning. And I also learn<br/>
by reading replies, especially to problems I don&#39;t have experience with like<br/>
how to handle wicked mothers-in-law and children with high tempers which<br/>
gives me insights into human dynamics and interpersonal relationships.<br/>
<br/>
But I never did ask for advice since that isn&#39;t how I learn best. I did lots<br/>
and lots and lots of reading all across the full spectrum of homeschooling<br/>
from fundamentalist Christian to radical unschooling back in the AOL days<br/>
when that was easy to do on the homeschooling message boards. Then I just<br/>
started writing out my thoughts on areas that I felt confident enough to<br/>
explain in front of lots of people who would scrutinize my logic and learned<br/>
more as I did that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m behind in my reading and haven&#39;t read responses to these questions, <br/>
yet.<br/>
<br/>
My answer is an unequivocal &lt;g&gt; yes, I still look to get advice here <br/>
and &quot;no&quot; I am not really only looking for ways to help.<br/>
<br/>
I find more ways to help than do I get advice that helps, though. And <br/>
that is because my kids are 13, 17, and 19 and I&#39;ve been INTENSELY <br/>
talking and practicing unschooling and unschooling-inspired parenting <br/>
for many years.<br/>
<br/>
But, I cannot in all honesty say I&#39;m here only as a &quot;teacher&quot; - I&#39;m <br/>
here as a fellow traveler EVEN if I&#39;m spending a fair amount of my time <br/>
as a de facto guide.<br/>
<br/>
I still have those &quot;AHA&quot; moments sometimes - when someone says <br/>
something just the right way to help me understand even more deeply. I <br/>
still have flashes of sudden insight about things I&#39;m doing with my <br/>
kids that I could do way better. And, I still find that it encourages <br/>
and strengthens my resolve to be the parent I want to be - I&#39;m stronger <br/>
and more determined because of my contact with all of you who are <br/>
treading the same path.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I&#39;m also strongly determined to make a difference in <br/>
children&#39;s lives whenever the opportunity arises. And lists like this <br/>
provide a lot of opportunities. So, I am also here in the hope that <br/>
something I write might end up making a child&#39;s life better.<br/>

I find that we never stop learning about how to be a better parent even if  <br/>
our kids are as old as ours are, Pam.  My eldest is 22 and married and it&#39;s  a <br/>
whole new world of having a daughter-in-law (first daughter of any kind for  <br/>
me).  It&#39;s new to watch them establish a home and a marriage and I have to  <br/>
learn how and when to offer advice and suggestions.  They have no children,  yet, <br/>
but there are some serious challenges ahead of me in the grandparenting  <br/>
department.  Oh, being the grandparent to the grandchild will be easy, but  being <br/>
the grandparent with the new parent will be the challenge.<br/>
 <br/>
No one ever has it all down.  Some of the principles I&#39;ve learend  through <br/>
lists like this can be applied to relationships with adult children,  too.  The <br/>
principless never really change, but the circumstances do,  and I have to <br/>
re-learn how to apply the principles as I go.  Once again,  the eldest child will <br/>
be the one who bares the brunt of my bumbling along, and  the youngest will <br/>
benefit the most.<br/>

more than being helped. And that that is only because so many people on <br/>
the lists have younger children, rather than older, than mine. Just a <br/>
matter of numbers - not of need for help.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2080027959">Out of respect for the serious contributions made by others on this <br/>
list, I prefer to lurk here and rarely post.  I thought this was a <br/>
good opportunity to say thank-you to everyone who selflessly gives <br/>
their time to share their experiences and insights.  I have come a <br/>
long way in the past 6 or 7 months, due in part to this group.<br/>
<br/>
When I first began reading on this group, I sometimes winced at the <br/>
harsh way I thought people were sometimes being dealt with.  But I <br/>
kept coming back here because a voice inside me said &quot;yeah, but <br/>
they&#39;re speaking the truth&quot;.  Now I&#39;m glad that you guys don&#39;t pussy-<br/>
foot around with the truth.  I&#39;ve had those A-HA moments that come <br/>
from patiently listening and being willing to look at things in new <br/>
ways.  My kids are still very young and I&#39;m sure I will learn a lot <br/>
more about parenting and unschooling from this group.<br/>
<br/>
My sincere thanks,<br/>
