<div id="ygrps-yiv-935483343">I had something happen today at Sunday School that at one time may not have<br/>
bothered me, but after researching the lifestyle of unschooling it really<br/>
bothered me.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I volunteered in the 4 year olds class-very scheduled, structured, at one<br/>
point we all went outside to let the kids play and one of the children did<br/>
not want to go outside to play-I knew once she went outside she would enjoy<br/>
the fresh air and freedom to move around, I asked the child if she wanted to<br/>
stay inside and play, the teacher looked at me and said she has NO CHOICE-so<br/>
we went outside and she did have fun.<br/>
<br/>
Then when we came inside they were given a choice of pictures  to color, as<br/>
they were coloring they were told, no you need to color it more, no do not<br/>
tap your crayons to make circles, no you can&#39;t have the cut out pumpkins<br/>
because you will color on the table, no that is NOT the color to color<br/>
with-pumpkins are orange!, <br/>
<br/>
I NEVER realized how much we as adults micromanage children&#39;s lives,<br/>
decisions, how we make them feel inferior in their choices, because we are<br/>
the adults and they do not know better.<br/>
<br/>
Just being in this class, okay sit in a circle, listen, pick up your toys<br/>
right as you are getting into pretend play, color this way, go outside, come<br/>
inside now, made me realize how much I dislike over structured &quot;learning&quot;<br/>
environments.  I have NEVER had an aha moment like the one I had today!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for the information and encouragement you provide to us<br/>
newbies who are learning how to adjust to the unschooling LIFESTYLE!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
God bless, <br/>

I recently left a church for several reasons, but this was one of <br/>
them.  And it sounds like my church was way more relaxed than yours!  <br/>
But it was also a 2 and 3 year olds class.  I&#39;m now attending a <br/>
Messianic church where the children are welcome in the main service.  <br/>
They play in the back or join in the singing or sit and listen as they <br/>
choose.  I nursed my baby in the service, and I&#39;ve never been one to <br/>
cover up, and no one batted an eyelash.</div>

A few years ago, I taught kindergarten at the school my children <br/>
attended.  From the very first week of school my oldest child had <br/>
trouble with his fourth grade teacher.  After attempts to remedy the <br/>
situation with the teacher/my co-worker, I finally came to the <br/>
realization that her philosophy of education and mine were not <br/>
compatible, and my son was caught in the middle.  I talked the <br/>
situation over with a friend of mine.  She sent me a copy of the lyrics <br/>
for Harry Chapin&#39;s &quot;Flowers are Red.&quot;  I turned in my resignation the <br/>
next day.  It is interesting to note that this particular friend was <br/>
unschooling her older daughter while her younger daughter was a student <br/>
in my class.  Her younger daughter&#39;s last day of school was the day <br/>
before mine. She knew when she sent that e-mail what conclusion I would <br/>
come to.  <br/>
<br/>
Just as the song implies, I am still trying to undo the damage.<br/>
<br/>
Tina (I posted the lyrics below for those who don&#39;t know the song)<br/>
<br/>
Flowers are Red <br/>
by Harry Chapin <br/>
<br/>
The little boy went first day of school<br/>
He got some crayons and started to draw<br/>
He put colors all over the paper<br/>
For colors was what he saw<br/>
And the teacher said.. What you doin&#39; young man<br/>
I&#39;m paintin&#39; flowers he said<br/>
She said... It&#39;s not the time for art young man<br/>
And anyway flowers are green and red<br/>
There&#39;s a time for everything young man<br/>
And a way it should be done<br/>
You&#39;ve got to show concern for everyone else<br/>
For you&#39;re not the only one<br/>
<br/>
And she said...<br/>
Flowers are red young man<br/>
Green leaves are green<br/>
There&#39;s no need to see flowers any other way<br/>
Than they way they always have been seen<br/>
<br/>
But the little boy said...<br/>
There are so many colors in the rainbow<br/>
So many colors in the morning sun<br/>
So many colors in the flower and I see every one<br/>
<br/>
Well the teacher said.. You&#39;re sassy<br/>
There&#39;s ways that things should be<br/>
And you&#39;ll paint flowers the way they are<br/>
So repeat after me.....<br/>
<br/>
And she said...<br/>
Flowers are red young man<br/>
Green leaves are green<br/>
There&#39;s no need to see flowers any other way<br/>
Than they way they always have been seen<br/>
<br/>
But the little boy said...<br/>
There are so many colors in the rainbow<br/>
So many colors in the morning sun<br/>
So many colors in the flower and I see every one<br/>
<br/>
The teacher put him in a corner<br/>
She said.. It&#39;s for your own good..<br/>
And you won&#39;t come out &#39;til you get it right<br/>
And are responding like you should<br/>
Well finally he got lonely<br/>
Frightened thoughts filled his head<br/>
And he went up to the teacher<br/>
And this is what he said.. and he said<br/>
<br/>
Flowers are red, green leaves are green<br/>
There&#39;s no need to see flowers any other way<br/>
Than the way they always have been seen<br/>
<br/>
Time went by like it always does<br/>
And they moved to another town<br/>
And the little boy went to another school<br/>
And this is what he found<br/>
The teacher there was smilin&#39;<br/>
She said...Painting should be fun<br/>
And there are so many colors in a flower<br/>
So let&#39;s use every one<br/>
<br/>
But that little boy painted flowers<br/>
In neat rows of green and red<br/>
And when the teacher asked him why<br/>
This is what he said.. and he said<br/>
<br/>
Flowers are red, green leaves are green<br/>
There&#39;s no need to see flowers any other way<br/>
Than the way they always have been seen.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1138921747">I just found this fabulous live performance of &quot;Flower are Red&quot; by <br/>
Harry Chapin on YouTube.  This is my favorite version of this song so <br/>
far, and it is the first time I&#39;ve heard Chapin&#39;s inspiration for the <br/>
song:  &quot;You&#39;re son marches to a different drummer, but don&#39;t worry <br/>
we&#39;ll have him marching with the rest of the band by the end of the <br/>
term.&quot;  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-619897588">Thanks Tina, that made me cry! :o) I was already in a teary frame of<br/>
mind having just watched Bridge to Terabitha with my girls. It breaks<br/>
my heart to think of children having the individuality squashed out of<br/>
them.<br/>

carry him out screaming if they had tried.  I just told them to that <br/>
i would always be available and he can come with me if he doesnt want <br/>
to go outside.  i try to just let the teachers know i am around if <br/>
the kids dont want to be there anymore.  My kids love to go to sunday <br/>
school or i would not take them.  when we miss for some reason they <br/>
are always upset.  I am sure one day some of them might change their <br/>
minds.  In the meantime, i just try to be available, when they <br/>
descide they are done.</div>

 </span></blockquote>I made some paper-mache pumpkins with my 4 and 6 year old and my<br/>
daughter (the 6 year old) painted hers green. Why? &quot;Because it&#39;s a<br/>
baby pumpkin!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Luckily there were no teachers or kids to laugh at her creativity :)<br/>

If most folks go to school for 12 up to 22 years (pre-K, K, 1-12, college, grad school) and if the deschooling process is approximately one month for every year in school, is it any wonder that the self-help sections of the libraries and the local Barnes & Noble are PACKED with 30-40 year olds???<br/>
<br/>
HUGE marching band, with former members all &quot;searching&quot; for themselves.<br/>
