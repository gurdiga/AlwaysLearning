<div id="ygrps-yiv-156753369">How funny that you should post this today! I spent 12 hours sitting  <br/>
in a ski lodge yesterday--read three books and knitted 3/4 of a  <br/>
scarf. One of the books I grabbed as I walked out the door was Teach  <br/>
Your Own. I hadn&#39;t read it in years and really needed a refresher of  <br/>
John Holt&#39;s wonderful observations and thoughts.<br/>

If you have the urge to write something about your thoughts about his  <br/>
thoughts, I&#39;ll find a place for it on the website, if you want.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1000203833">Thanks, I&#39;ll think about it. I&quot;m in a weird place right now with  <br/>
homeschooling--feeling like it&#39;s so obviously been the right thing  <br/>
for my kids, and struggling with my son&#39;s desire to go to high school  <br/>
next year solely to play football!<br/>
<br/>
I also really enjoyed a book called Morning by Morning written by an  <br/>
African-American woman named Paula Penn-Nabrit who pulled her three  <br/>
boys out of a fancy private school to homeschool them. Have you heard  <br/>
of it?<br/>

stuck into a fancy private school (after being homeschooled almost  <br/>
all his life) because his dad says being African American,  <br/>
homeschooling&#39;s no good for him.  He&#39;s not liking the school much,  <br/>
but he&#39;s making B&#39;s and taking advantage of some of the fun stuff.   <br/>
So to his dad it looks like a good move.  Maybe that book would help  <br/>
their family.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-770282418">Yes, the author never hides the fact that her sons hated  <br/>
homeschooling! She does say that she knew about unschooling and  <br/>
thought it sounded wonderful in theory, but knew that her boys lacked  <br/>
the motivation to ever do the cool stuff she heard unschooling  <br/>
parents talk about their kids doing.<br/>
<br/>
That bugged me, because throughout the book she was bucking  <br/>
assumptions at every turn. Seems she didn&#39;t even recognize that  <br/>
assumption she made about her kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-24384535">This book probably would be useful for your friend. It was subtle yet  <br/>
relentless racism that prompted them to remove the boys from school.  <br/>
The author&#39;s uncle was an attorney who argued &quot;Brown v. Board of  <br/>
Education&quot; at the Supreme Court! She got a lot of argument from her  <br/>
family for the decision to homeschool. I think her reasons, which she  <br/>
describes in great detail, would make interesting reading for your  <br/>
friend.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-912292971">Hi Sandra!<br/>
<br/>
One of our Phoenix moms has a website and magazine for African-<br/>
American Unschoolers that might be of interest to your friend (and <br/>
others):<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.afamunschool.com/">http://www.afamunschool.com/</a><br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.afamunschool.com/fungasa.html">http://www.afamunschool.com/fungasa.html</a> (magazine)<br/>
<br/>
There are a number of books and resources on the site.  Courtney has <br/>
five awesome kids and is awesome herself. :)  We don&#39;t see her often <br/>
because she&#39;s on the west side and very busy, but perhaps your <br/>
friend could call or email her with his concerns.  She&#39;ll be a bit <br/>
busy right now, but she usually answers emails quickly.<br/>
<br/>
Take care, c.<br/>
<br/>
Cindy Fox<br/>
