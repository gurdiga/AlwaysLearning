There are lots of cool songs that I think resonate with unschooling philosophy. <br/>
<br/>
John Mayer&#39;s song &quot;No Such Thing&quot; <br/>
Pete Seeger&#39;s &quot;Little Boxes&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I will have to think of some more now. <br/>

A song that has always brought a happy twitch to my unschooling heart is the song, &#39;If You Want To Sing Out, Sing Out&#39; by Cat Stevens.<br/>
