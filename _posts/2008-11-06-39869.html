There are many new members to the list.  Please read the page above  <br/>
before posting things that are coming at unschooling indirectly.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-137412198">It&#39;s the perception that this list is a place to connect with fellow  <br/>
unschoolers that  causes the most frustration and anger for new members.<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of this list is to provide a resource of *ideas* for  <br/>
people who are trying to unschool.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes people join the list with the need to connect with fellow  <br/>
unschoolers and see 2000+  they could connect with but then Sandra  <br/>
jumps in the way and says this isn&#39;t the place for that. 2000+  <br/>
unschoolers right there and Sandra&#39;s saying don&#39;t try to connect with  <br/>
them, talk about ideas.<br/>
<br/>
What a bully! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
If people don&#39;t want advice about how to get unschooling work for  <br/>
their family this isn&#39;t the list for them. If they don&#39;t want their  <br/>
words pulled apart to analyze what&#39;s working for unschooling and  <br/>
what&#39;s hindering unschooling for the 2000+ people here, this isn&#39;t  <br/>
the list for them to post to. (Geez, now no one will post after that ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Lots of people stay because they *do* want to discuss what helps  <br/>
unschooling work and what gets in the way. And they form connections  <br/>
through that mutual interest :-)<br/>
<br/>
Lots of people leave because they wanted to connect with others who  <br/>
wear the unschooling label (not caring if the labels don&#39;t all mean  <br/>
the same thing).<br/>
<br/>
Some of them come back because they realize they also wanted the  <br/>
discussion and that need now outweighs the need to connect. And once  <br/>
their need matches what the list provides, they find, as a side  <br/>
effect, a connection with unschoolers who love discussing what makes  <br/>
unschooling works.<br/>

I&#39;m not sure what inspired Joyce to write that, but I&#39;m really glad  <br/>
she did.<br/>
<br/>
I woke up this morning to phenomenal repetitive, vitriolic tirade.  It  <br/>
was by someone who expressly did NOT give me permission to publish it,  <br/>
to which I responded  &quot;I won&#39;t quote any on the list or on my site,  <br/>
but you don&#39;t get to thrash at someone, and at one of the list members  <br/>
in nearly 3,000 words, what would take over five pages to print out  <br/>
AND get to tell me I can&#39;t share that fact.  It would be like going to  <br/>
someone&#39;s front porch and throwing a GIGANTIC screaming fit, but first  <br/>
saying &quot;I do not give you permission throw me out of your yard or to  <br/>
call the police.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
No one has to post on this list.  Lurking is fine.  Posts will be  <br/>
discussed, though.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone came here to hear &quot;You&#39;re a good mother,&quot; and &quot;I want to be  <br/>
like you,&quot; and &quot;Your child is lucky to have you as a mom!&quot; those  <br/>
things are here:<br/>
