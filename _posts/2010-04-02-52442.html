<div id="ygrps-yiv-256611530">Here&#39;s an article describing research that shows that not only is spanking detrimental to kids (increases child&#39;s aggression) but that other conventional forms of discipline not only don&#39;t &quot;improve&quot; children&#39;s behavior but also increase children&#39;s anxiety.<br/>
<br/>
Spanking sparks aggression, does little to reduce behavior problems<br/>

&quot;It may be that the long-term investments that we make in children, like spending time with them, showing that we love them and listening to them, have a more powerful positive effect on behavior than any form of discipline,&quot; said Andrew Grogan-Kaylor, U-M associate professor of social work.<br/>

This makes sense in my experience, that spending time with my kids  <br/>
and listening to them and talking with them, which I think does show  <br/>
my love, has had lots and lots of positive effects, so many it makes  <br/>
me giddy sometimes.  And I really really think that kids would like  <br/>
their parents to spend time with them.<br/>
<br/>
This happened in World of Warcraft a couple days ago.  (Which I  <br/>
started out playing with my kids to know about the game they were  <br/>
playing and help them.  It&#39;s turned out that I like the game and  <br/>
still play with them....mostly I help them with gold, and using my  <br/>
priest to help them stay alive longer.  :-))<br/>
------<br/>
A player:  What did you farm to get your mechano hog?  (meaning, how  <br/>
did you make so much gold to get that very expensive riding machine  <br/>
(carries 2 players)?)<br/>
<br/>
Luke:  My mom&#39;s love.<br/>
<br/>
A player:  ...   (meaning, huh?)<br/>
<br/>
Luke:  She gave it to me for christmas, we&#39;re both engineers.   <br/>
(engineering is a profession in WoW, where you can make really cool  <br/>
gadgets)<br/>
<br/>
A player:  Your mom plays WoW?  Sweet.<br/>
-------<br/>
This has happened lots of times, and it&#39;s always made me think that  <br/>
kids really like their parents to participate with them in a lot of  <br/>
things.   Only one time did a player say something about never  <br/>
wanting their parent to play WoW with them.<br/>

Most keep defending spanking, it didn&#39;t hurt them and it doesn&#39;t hurt their<br/>
kids. So spanking will go on...<br/>

At your house, you mean?<br/>
<br/>
They can&#39;t make you spank.  They can&#39;t keep you from spanking.<br/>
The purpose of this list is to help any single reader find good ideas  <br/>
and arguments to help her understand unschooling.<br/>

If you&#39;re any closer to understanding how you want to interact with  <br/>
your children, then the list and the links have been helpful.<br/>
