<div id="ygrps-yiv-1553150145">In my travels, I came across these two Personality Tests I thought you folks <br/>
might like. I personally find them even more entertaining than Meyers-Briggs. <br/>
(By the way...I am INFP...what are you?<br/>

The first tells you what Fellowship of the Ring character you most resemble. <br/>

I am Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov (and don&#39;t really know enough about dead Russian <br/>
composers to understand the significance.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1329040123">If you want more tests like the LotR & Russian composer ones, there are <br/>
hundreds of them at selectsmart.com. All kinds of tests - which type of <br/>
musical instrument are you, which character of Babylon 5 are you, which Star <br/>
Trek alien species you are, what genre of book are you...<br/>
