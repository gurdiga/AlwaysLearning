In school, this is&nbsp;used by some kids to play to the teachers&#39;s preferences and prejudices (or just to play the teachers). When I was a kid, the only bad grades I got were in&nbsp;conduct or deportment. I was off exercising my interpersonal intelligence, but it was not on the curriculum, so it was &quot;being bad.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br class="ygrps-yiv-701828665"><br class="ygrps-yiv-701828665">In the world outside of school, it can be the best part of some kids lives!
