<br/>
Actually, we have quit going to doctors for the most part.  I don&#39;t think<br/>
Zach has seen one in about 5 years.  I am not an overcontrolling, meddling<br/>
mom.  We raise livestock and I know what malnutrition looks like (lack<br/>
luster hair is a major indicator).  Being an unschooling family, we don&#39;t<br/>
feel the need for an expert to verify the obvious.   Zach is malnourished.<br/>
He is responding well to my taking him snacks and I will continue to do so.<br/>
Sometimes it is easy to feel you have fallen through the proverbial cracks<br/>
in a large family and I enjoy reconnecting with him and he appears to be<br/>
enjoying it as well.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, thats it.  I want to read their book.  The article in Mother Earth News<br/>
was truly interesting.<br/>
