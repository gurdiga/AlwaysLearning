<div id="ygrps-yiv-1914066145">That was prettymuch my same reaction to the article. Some people are <br/>
totally opposed to TV or some set limits on it. So far we haven&#39;t <br/>
set limits on TV just like we don&#39;t set limits on computer stuff, <br/>
play time, etc. I leave it up to my child to decide as much as <br/>
possible for himself. TV is a particularly hard parenting area IMHO, <br/>
some days my son is a royal couch potatoe - other days he does other <br/>
things, obviously he still learns a lot whether he watches TV or <br/>
not. Sometimes I get that periodic unschoolers panic disorder that <br/>
makes me think he&#39;s not doing okey if he watches so much TV, but <br/>
usually within a week of me feeling that way then his interest in <br/>
certain shows may change and he usually looses interest in the TV <br/>
for awhile. Currently he&#39;s very &quot;into&quot; Code Lyoko which is rated for <br/>
7up and even though my ds is only 6 he can tell you exactly what is <br/>
happening and even has his own ideas for story plots - but he does <br/>
that with a lot of things - started with his Thomas trains - he saw <br/>
videos and he also made up lots and lots of his own scenerios, not <br/>
just repeating what he saw on the TV. So I feel like as long as he&#39;s <br/>
using the TV as inspiration and not just blindly following what is <br/>
being said or done on the TV that he is doing okey with watching TV, <br/>
that he is understanding that TV isn&#39;t real life, etc. He goes <br/>
through phases like I say sometimes I think he just must not feel <br/>
well because he will lay in bed all day and watch TV and then he may <br/>
spend a whole week working with a computer program or a robot toy or <br/>
building with blocks, etc. So he&#39;s not drawn to he HAS to watch TV <br/>
everyday, etc. if he wants to do something else he will and he <br/>
usually has no objections to running errands with me or going to the <br/>
park as well, although sometimes he will ask if we can wait 10 <br/>
minutes until this program is over. SO mostly I am for TV and free <br/>
access to it but admitedly there are days I wish he would turn it <br/>
off and do something else. How do you deal with TV with your kids? I <br/>
am lucky enough that I rarely watch TV unless I rent a movie or some <br/>
show comes on and I plan to watch it, I never watch TV just to &quot;have <br/>
something to do&quot; so I hope my child doesn&#39;t either. Moza<br/>

If whatever else is going on in the house is more interesting to him than<br/>
TV, then he will want to do that instead. Sometimes it takes an effort on<br/>
the part of the parent to make life more interesting.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 I have a relative with whom I have shared my ideas (the ideas expressed on<br/>
this list, which have worked for us.) about letting kids self regulate with<br/>
regards to TV and of course, she says that her son would NEVER stop watching<br/>
if she didn&#39;t make him. (This conversation was going on because they had<br/>
recently bought a satellite dish and finally had cool channels and all he<br/>
was doing was watching TV.) I told her that it would wear off to some extent<br/>
when it wasn&#39;t new anymore and also when he realized that it wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
taken away.  She says she tried it for months and it was always the same,<br/>
T,V TV, TV.  I suggested that he didn&#39;t trust that he&#39;d always have access<br/>
to it and so he might be watching more partly because of that.  She<br/>
disagreed, but after a couple more months, they had the satellite removed.<br/>
He was right.  The freedom didn&#39;t last.  And maybe they made more of an<br/>
effort to do things that interested him, apart from TV, then he wouldn&#39;t<br/>
have been so drawn to it.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Speaking of cool things. We bought a $10 radio shack illuminated microscope<br/>
today that has 60X-100X magnifying power and it&#39;s really a cool toy for only<br/>
$10.  It&#39;s only a little bigger than a credit card and it&#39;s wicked fun to<br/>
play with.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-391064396">&quot;Sometimes it takes an effort on<br/>
the part of the parent to make life more interesting&quot; - yep I agree <br/>
on what you said - most of the time when I&#39;m sick of him watching TV <br/>
is when I have been also been feeling sick for a few days(usually I <br/>
get a kidney infection or a sinus allergy heachaches) or I am jammed <br/>
up working too much at my work at home job as well, or relaxing for <br/>
a week because the weeks prior have been so bus. But like I say it <br/>
goes in waves or something with him, sometimes he&#39;s interested in <br/>
something else and sometimes the TV is just more interesting, so I <br/>
try to respect that but I also try to encourage his other interests <br/>
as well. Do you have any particular things you do when you feel the <br/>
TV is becoming an event to fulfill boredom instead of being <br/>
educational or inspirational? We&#39;re non-coersive so I&#39;m not going to <br/>
just tell him to turn it off, or that he has to come do whatever <br/>
with me, etc. Moza<br/>

Moza,<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t really looked at it that way, that it&#39;s used to fulfill boredom<br/>
instead of being educational or inspirational.  I just figure they are<br/>
getting something out of it.  My kids really don&#39;t keep watching when it<br/>
isn&#39;t something they like  &lt;at least not for long&gt; so I don&#39;t usually feel<br/>
like I need to draw them away from it.   If we get in a funk I might suggest<br/>
board (nothing like a good six hour game of Monopoly!) or card games because<br/>
my family really enjoys them.  Have you ever played Zilch, a dice game?<br/>
It&#39;s fun for all ages and easy. I am sure if you googled Zilch, you&#39;d find<br/>
the directions.  You need 5 dice.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
In the winter is when we are more often in a funk and we just need something<br/>
to break up the monotony.  That&#39;s when I usually tell the girls I&#39;m going<br/>
outside and see if they want to come with me.  It always makes me feel<br/>
better to get out in the fresh air.  We have cross country skis, sleds, and<br/>
snow shoes, so if there is actually snow, it&#39;s a great diversion and makes<br/>
us feel so good, even if it&#39;s only for 30 minutes ( sometimes it&#39;s mighty<br/>
cold here in Maine.)  My girls ride horses at a barn up the road and a visit<br/>
to the barn to bring up carrots or apples always cheers them up.  We&#39;ll<br/>
shovel stalls sometimes and that cheers up the horses.  Maybe there is a<br/>
farm nearby that you could volunteer at?  Of course, there is always<br/>
visiting friends.  My kids really love it when I join them in a networked<br/>
game on the computers.  &lt;shoot em up&gt; Not really my cup of tea, but it sure<br/>
makes them happy.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I guess, you really have to take your son&#39;s likes into account.  <br/>

&lt;&lt; Do you have any particular things you do when you feel the <br/>
TV is becoming an event to fulfill boredom instead of being <br/>
educational or inspirational &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One thing I do when I have that fear is think of how many &quot;free hours&quot; a kid <br/>
in school might have during which he could be expected to &quot;do nothing.&quot;   And <br/>
then I leave my kids alone about it.<br/>
<br/>
In a moment when what one is doing isn&#39;t educational or inspirational, maybe <br/>
it&#39;s relaxing, or daydreamish.    <br/>
<br/>
Although I think children DO learn all the time, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the <br/>
same as parents thinking they should be taught (or stimulated or educated) all <br/>
the time.<br/>
<br/>
If a child is watching ants or playing in the dirt with a stick, maybe the <br/>
parent things five minutes is enough, but maybe the kid isn&#39;t through thinking <br/>
what he&#39;s thinking, or seeing what he&#39;s seeing.   <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never known a human to watch ants for one second longer than they wanted <br/>
to. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if the mom&#39;s getting antsy, she could go and do something else and <br/>
forget the kids are still watching TV.   <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my personal Gilligan&#39;s Island story, which couldn&#39;t happen without <br/>
having watched re-runs:<br/>
<br/>
When I used to watch Gilligan&#39;s Island in 4:00 re-runs after school every <br/>
day, I would wonder whose idea it was for the plot, how many writers there were, <br/>
how they decided who could come and visit, what device they would use to <br/>
prevent the visitor from rescuing them, how they must plan in advance not to have <br/>
too-similar plots near each other, and the re-runs must be kept in the rest,&quot; <br/>
but in later seasons it said, &quot;the movie star, the professor and Mary Ann,&quot; and <br/>
I wondered whether they had resung the whole thing or just spliced in that <br/>
line, because it sounded the same as it had before. And had they done it because <br/>
the actors complained? Their agents complained? I wondered whether the <br/>
pedal-powered washing machine (or whatever it was) really worked by the pedals, or <br/>
whether it was just secretly plugged in, and if so, where did the wires run? I <br/>
wondered if much of it was on indoor sets. How deep was that water? (As an <br/>
adult, I saw what&#39;s left of the set at Universal Studios. Cool! Outside! Actual <br/>
little lake.) When I would see a show the second time, I&#39;d look around for <br/>
things I had missed the first time. I would re-write lines in my mind, things that <br/>
could have been funnier, or sounded more in character for that person. I&#39;d <br/>
wonder who knew more about hammock making, the captain or the professor? Maybe <br/>
Ginger or Mary Ann knew macramé. When there was a show which didn&#39;t have one of <br/>
the actors in, I&#39;d wonder whether he was sick or on vacation or what? And if <br/>
an actor misses the filming of a sitcom, does he still get paid? I wondered <br/>
about them having to keep their hair the same for years, and which of them were <br/>
might be wearing wigs. Where were they supposed to be getting nail polish and <br/>
lipstick? Hair spray? I wondered if the professor was a physics professor or <br/>
engineering, or what, and whether he would lose his job at the university. I <br/>
wondered about that Mr. Magoo voice on Thurston Howell. I wondered about Amelia <br/>
Earhart. I wondered about the soundtrack music. Did they just have little <br/>
themes they pushed a button on during final edit, or was each show done <br/>
separately? I wondered if the fruit was real or props. I wondered about cameras--where <br/>
were they? Did they have to sweep the dirt between takes? I wondered if the guy <br/>
who played the lost WWII pilot was really Japanese. I could think more during <br/>
an episode of Gilligan&#39;s Island than most other people I knew could think in <br/>
a whole week. I didn&#39;t bother to ask my parents any of the questions. They <br/>
would have thought it was stupid to be thinking them. <br/>
<br/>
So to all outside appearances (except to my cousin, Nada, who was my age) I <br/>
was just zoning out, involved in the plot of another 25 minutes of Gilligan&#39;s <br/>
Island. That wasn&#39;t true at all.<br/>

Lately my kids can watch ants in the bathroom.  It rained really hard for a <br/>
couple of nights straight and the ants found the cat food.<br/>
<br/>
I never used to use Pine Sol, but because of Little Shop of Horrors, I bought <br/>
some.  One of the lines in Audrey&#39;s great solo song, &quot;Somewhere that&#39;s Green&quot; <br/>
is &quot;. . .in the PineSol-scented air, somewhere that&#39;s green.&quot;  So Holly <br/>
asked, and I got some.   <br/>

building with  blocks, etc..... SO mostly I am for TV and free <br/>
access to it but admitedly  there are days I wish he would turn it <br/>
off and do something else. How do  you deal with TV with your kids?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
*I* go through periods when I just sit a &quot;veg&quot; in front of the  <br/>
TV---sometimes for days at a time. Sometimes I&#39;m sick or tired, sometimes I&#39;m  &quot;digesting&quot; <br/>
something I spent a long time working on, sometimes there&#39;s  something I want <br/>
to watch. I go through periods when the TV is never on,  yet I&#39;ll lie in bed a <br/>
read for hours and hours at a time---book after book after  book. I go <br/>
through periods when every waking moment I&#39;m in the garden or  painting or tiling or <br/>
cooking or planning a conference or driving (like  that day we drove from MA <br/>
to Columbia, SC. Whew! I sometimes have friends over  and we talk and eat and <br/>
talk some more---maybe for HOURS! Some days all I  do is sit at the computer <br/>
and read or write (real writing, by the way).<br/>
 <br/>
People who are in control of their lives seem to make reasonable decisions  <br/>
on how to spend their days. It&#39;s the people who are NOT in control, who are  <br/>
unable to make real decisions about what to do when----THOSE people are the ones <br/>
 who (understandably) seem out of control about what they DO do.<br/>
 <br/>
Kind of like food: A child with free rein on what he eats and when will eat  <br/>
a fairly balanced diet over a month----maybe NOT each day----but averaged over <br/>
a  longer period of time. Don&#39;t look at six straight hours of tv as harmful <br/>
(that&#39;s  just watching _Titanic_ and _The Making of Titanic_!!!). Average it <br/>
out over the  month. My guess is that it averages out to LESS than the amount <br/>
the average  schooled kid watches----the kid who&#39;s only allowed so many hours <br/>
per day (he&#39;ll  be SURE to take every one!)!<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am lucky enough that I rarely watch TV unless I rent a  movie or some <br/>
 </span></blockquote>show comes on and I plan to watch it, I never watch TV just to  &quot;have <br/>
something to do&quot; so I hope my child doesn&#39;t either.  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
You&#39;re not &quot;lucky&quot;. You&#39;re CHOOSING to do that. Your child may be  different. <br/>
He may do the same. <br/>
 <br/>
We have three TVs. None are on now. Duncan and a friend are out bouncing on  <br/>
the trampoline. I&#39;m on the computer (and getting ready to garden). Ben&#39;s at  <br/>
work. And Cameron is out to lunch with his girlfriend, plans to work for my  <br/>
parents, and speak to a man about a job. <br/>
 <br/>
I didn&#39;t tell Duncan and Tristram that it&#39;s a beautiful day (86 and sunny  <br/>
with a light breeze)----they can tell that themselves. And did. And are  out <br/>
enjoying the beautiful day! Because they CHOOSE  to! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&lt;&lt; Do you have any particular things you do when you feel the<br/>
TV is becoming an event to fulfill boredom instead of being<br/>
educational or inspirational &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One thing I do when I have that fear is think of how many &quot;free hours&quot; a kid<br/>
in school might have during which he could be expected to &quot;do nothing.&quot;<br/>
And<br/>
then I leave my kids alone about it.<br/>
<br/>
In a moment when what one is doing isn&#39;t educational or inspirational, maybe<br/>
it&#39;s relaxing, or daydreamish.<br/>
<br/>
Although I think children DO learn all the time, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the<br/>
same as parents thinking they should be taught (or stimulated or educated)<br/>
all<br/>
the time.<br/>
<br/>
If a child is watching ants or playing in the dirt with a stick, maybe the<br/>
parent things five minutes is enough, but maybe the kid isn&#39;t through<br/>
thinking<br/>
what he&#39;s thinking, or seeing what he&#39;s seeing.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never known a human to watch ants for one second longer than they<br/>
wanted<br/>
to. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if the mom&#39;s getting antsy, she could go and do something else and<br/>
forget the kids are still watching TV.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my personal Gilligan&#39;s Island story, which couldn&#39;t happen without<br/>
having watched re-runs:<br/>
<br/>
When I used to watch Gilligan&#39;s Island in 4:00 re-runs after school every<br/>
day, I would wonder whose idea it was for the plot, how many writers there<br/>
were,<br/>
how they decided who could come and visit, what device they would use to<br/>
prevent the visitor from rescuing them, how they must plan in advance not to<br/>
have<br/>
too-similar plots near each other, and the re-runs must be kept in the<br/>
rest,&quot;<br/>
but in later seasons it said, &quot;the movie star, the professor and Mary Ann,&quot;<br/>
and<br/>
I wondered whether they had resung the whole thing or just spliced in that<br/>
line, because it sounded the same as it had before. And had they done it<br/>
because<br/>
the actors complained? Their agents complained? I wondered whether the<br/>
pedal-powered washing machine (or whatever it was) really worked by the<br/>
pedals, or<br/>
whether it was just secretly plugged in, and if so, where did the wires run?<br/>
I<br/>
wondered if much of it was on indoor sets. How deep was that water? (As an<br/>
adult, I saw what&#39;s left of the set at Universal Studios. Cool! Outside!<br/>
Actual<br/>
little lake.) When I would see a show the second time, I&#39;d look around for<br/>
things I had missed the first time. I would re-write lines in my mind,<br/>
things that<br/>
could have been funnier, or sounded more in character for that person. I&#39;d<br/>
wonder who knew more about hammock making, the captain or the professor?<br/>
Maybe<br/>
Ginger or Mary Ann knew macramé. When there was a show which didn&#39;t have one<br/>
of<br/>
the actors in, I&#39;d wonder whether he was sick or on vacation or what? And if<br/>
an actor misses the filming of a sitcom, does he still get paid? I wondered<br/>
about them having to keep their hair the same for years, and which of them<br/>
were<br/>
might be wearing wigs. Where were they supposed to be getting nail polish<br/>
and<br/>
lipstick? Hair spray? I wondered if the professor was a physics professor or<br/>
engineering, or what, and whether he would lose his job at the university. I<br/>
wondered about that Mr. Magoo voice on Thurston Howell. I wondered about<br/>
Amelia<br/>
Earhart. I wondered about the soundtrack music. Did they just have little<br/>
themes they pushed a button on during final edit, or was each show done<br/>
separately? I wondered if the fruit was real or props. I wondered about<br/>
cameras--where<br/>
were they? Did they have to sweep the dirt between takes? I wondered if the<br/>
guy<br/>
who played the lost WWII pilot was really Japanese. I could think more<br/>
during<br/>
an episode of Gilligan&#39;s Island than most other people I knew could think in<br/>
a whole week. I didn&#39;t bother to ask my parents any of the questions. They<br/>
would have thought it was stupid to be thinking them.<br/>
<br/>
So to all outside appearances (except to my cousin, Nada, who was my age) I<br/>
was just zoning out, involved in the plot of another 25 minutes of<br/>
Gilligan&#39;s<br/>
Island. That wasn&#39;t true at all.<br/>

most of  the time when I&#39;m sick of him watching TV <br/>
is when I have been also been  feeling sick for a few days(usually I <br/>
get a kidney infection or a sinus  allergy heachaches) or I am jammed <br/>
up working too much at my work at home  job as well, or relaxing for <br/>
a week because the weeks prior have been so  busy. But like I say it <br/>
goes in waves or something with him, sometimes  he&#39;s interested in <br/>
something else and sometimes the TV is just more  interesting, so I <br/>
try to respect that but I also try to encourage his  other interests <br/>
as well. Do you have any particular things you do when you  feel the <br/>
TV is becoming an event to fulfill boredom instead of being  <br/>
educational or inspirational?&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ll keep going! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I find myself veging out sometimes after a stressful or eventful week. I  <br/>
could just as easily do it with a book, but sometimes I&#39;d rather get my info  <br/>
through the TV instead of a book.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t use it to &quot;fulfill boredom&quot;. I&#39;m NOT bored. I&#39;m choosing to engage  <br/>
my mind in one medium over another.<br/>
 <br/>
Mine comes in waves too. I tend to do more TV watching when it&#39;s raining or  <br/>
too hot or too cold----or when I&#39;m out of paint or plants! &lt;g&gt; I also  watch <br/>
more TV when there&#39;s a marathon or a series-----or when we&#39;re &quot;doing  a <br/>
vertical&quot;---like this week: we&#39;re all &quot;doing a Hitchcock&quot;. We picked up_Dial M  for <br/>
Murder_, _Vertigo_, _Psycho_, and _Rear Window_ from the library as well as  a <br/>
few books on Hitchcock. Next, we&#39;re looking into a Johnny Depp vertical and  <br/>
then maybe a Jack Nicholson vertical (we watched _The Two Jakes_ and Easy  <br/>
Rider_ this week.<br/>
 <br/>
For the last few weeks, we haven&#39;t watched *any* movies. Now we&#39;re excited  <br/>
about what&#39;s coming up. So it goes....<br/>

<br/>
I had never seen Edward Scissorhands until recently.  Marty and Kirby had.  <br/>
Holly and I hadn&#39;t.  I think it could go as a set with &quot;Pleasantville,&quot; which <br/>
has new interest for kids now because it has what&#39;s&#39;his Spiderman.  <br/>
<br/>
Not long before that I had picked up a copy of &quot;Don Juan de Marco&quot; with <br/>
Johnny Depp and Marlon Brando (and Faye Dunaway, as the third most famous).    <br/>
Younger kids would<br/>
Z* care, but it&#39;s about love and reality.  I really like it.<br/>
