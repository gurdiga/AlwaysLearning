<div id="ygrps-yiv-94156335">Sorry for another U.S. kind of question.<br/>
Rachael Profilosky had researched unschooling, and found this figure:  150,000 families unschool<br/>
<br/>
I asked where the number came from.  She said it was out there somewhere, but had been based on the idea that 10% of homeschoolers are unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
She asked me if the number seemed high or low.  I said it wasn&#39;t that, it was that there&#39;s no real way to come up with a number, because of the way California and Texas registrations are (and aren&#39;t).  <br/>
<br/>
Does it seem high or low to people here who are wiser in the ways of estimating or thinking about big numbers?<br/>
<br/>
And for people in other places with other terminology, if we include other terms for non-structured, without-curriculum homeschooling, do you think it&#39;s 10%?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s probably more in places like the U.K. and India, and less in the U.S., but I could be wrong.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1273324359">Based on my knowledge of homeschooling/unschooling in my state, my first reaction was that 10 percent is high. <br/>
<br/>
The National Home Education Research Institute (NHERI) currently estimates that there are 2.04 million homeschooled students in the US; using 10 percent would bump the number of unschoolers up to 200,000. I don&#39;t believe there are that many. <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m sure that there is a significantly larger number if we include those that <br/>
don&#39;t radically unschool.  There are a LOT of people that do &quot;eclectic&quot; <br/>
homeschooling and call it unschooling.  Even where I live that rings true and we <br/>
have very relaxed homeschooling laws.  It&#39;s probably even more true in highly <br/>
regulated places.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-737984838">It&#39;s a difficult thing to pin down, that&#39;s for sure. If a significant portion of eclectic learners are included in unschooling, then 10 percent probably is an underestimate. I&#39;m in a highly regulated state and a lot of people identify themselves as &quot;relaxed&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Pat Farenga uses the 10 percent estimate. <br/>
