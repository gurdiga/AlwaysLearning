He&#39;s clearly much too gifted to consider sending him to school. ;)<br/>

I&#39;m usually just a lurker...only unschooling for about 5 months.  My <br/>
dd is 10, and was always considered &quot;gifted&quot; .  I pulled her out of a <br/>
horribly backwards school here in Boonville MO, after we moved here <br/>
from Dallas, TX.  (talk about culture shock!)  Anyway, what she <br/>
mostly loves to do is stay on the computer...role playing, reading <br/>
comics, game sites, anime sites, oekaki sites....She is teaching <br/>
herself Japanese, as well...she sings Japanese anime songe, and has a <br/>
Jap/Eng dictionary that I got her for Xmas that she just LOVES.  <br/>
People say &quot;all she does all day is sit at the computer&quot;  But I know <br/>
how much she is actually learning.  The other day we were visiting a <br/>
site that was very wordy...She read it aloud over and over, looking <br/>
up the hard words she didn&#39;t know like &#39;cogitate&#39; <br/>
and &#39;sporogonically&#39; and &#39;lethiferous&#39; .  And they don&#39;t see learning <br/>
in that????  <br/>
<br/>
I love unschooling!!!<br/>
