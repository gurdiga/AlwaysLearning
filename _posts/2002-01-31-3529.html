<div id="ygrps-yiv-175803733">Thanks Tia.  Your right about my kids.  As I move through this process, it is easy to understand now, that my kids have been trying to teach me for so long.  I&#39;m so glad I have finally started to hear them.  <br/>

&gt;I&#39;m intending to become an experienced unschooler can I play?<br/>

If it were up to me you could.  &lt;g&gt;  I&#39;ve thoroughly enjoyed watching your <br/>
process on the other list.  (Your kids are good &quot;teachers&quot;)<br/>
