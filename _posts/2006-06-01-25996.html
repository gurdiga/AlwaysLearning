<div id="ygrps-yiv-188227638">I read it twice and it still just looked wrong:<br/>
<br/>
***TEACHING TOTS TO TEENS***<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tater tots to teens; that makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
Teaching tots to sing; maybe.<br/>
<br/>
Feeding tots to teens, not nice (unless tots are assumed to be tater- <br/>
variety).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Then I saw what it really meant and realized if failed to make sense  <br/>
because of the list it was on!<br/>
