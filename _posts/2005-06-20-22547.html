<div id="ygrps-yiv-390200791">Hi All,<br/>
I am new to the list, I have been lurking here for a few weeks now. I pulled my now 9 yo son from the third grade in March. I have been reading alot about homeschooling since then and now think that unschooling would work for us, especially since he was refusing to do anything at all that seemed like school...<br/>
My question for you today, I&#39;ve seen alot of posts on video games. Basically he would play video games non-stop, not eat, not drink, not sleep if we didn&#39;t make him, only *very* quick bathroom breaks. I&#39;ve decided for the last few weeks that I would let him play as much Gameboy/PS2/whatever he wants, because surely he would get bored with it sooner or later, right? Problem is, there is always a new game out there to try (maybe that&#39;s not really a problem). <br/>
So - do I just let him play video games as much as he wants forever? Even if I can stand it I&#39;m pretty sure my husband can&#39;t...he&#39;s not too sure about this whole homeschool thing anyway. <br/>
I guess I&#39;m looking for experience, advice, about if this is okay? How much video games is okay?<br/>
Thanks for your support and input.<br/>

Please read the graveyard of similar statements here:<br/>

I hope one of those will work.<br/>

Some people read a lot, and there are always new books out there (and  <br/>
magazines, and cereal boxes).  <br/>
Some people watch movies a lot, and they&#39;re always making new ones.<br/>

It might take a while to get your husband to a place of understanding, but  <br/>
less time if you rent/buy and watch Video Game Revolution (I think it&#39;s called, <br/>
 there&#39;s a link and lots of stuff here:)<br/>

much video games is okay?-=-<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Okay&quot; depends on what your priorities and intentions and hopes are.<br/>
It&#39;s been way more than okay at my house, it&#39;s been enrichment, fun,  <br/>
geography, mapreading, vocabulary, history (though it&#39;s never discussed or  thought <br/>
about that way here, just by me in discussions like this to try to  explain to <br/>
people who haven&#39;t thought of anything past &quot;eye hand  coordination&quot;)...<br/>
 <br/>
All of this involves looking at things a little differently.  If you  think <br/>
of food as meal-times and plate-cleanings rather than as sustenance and  fuel, <br/>
it will be harder to think it&#39;s good to deliver meals  &quot;computerside.&quot;  If you <br/>
think of sleep as something that should happen on a  schedule, it might be <br/>
something you think will never happen, but people sleep  when they&#39;re sleepy <br/>
UNLESS sleep has been forced, measured, commanded,  forbidden, and removed from a <br/>
personal awareness of &quot;I&#39;m tired and going to bed  now.&quot;  THOSE kids, the <br/>
controlled kids, will try to stay up all late just  because they can, because <br/>
they never have before, because they think it would be  cool, would make them <br/>
adults, would be exciting.  Kids who can stay up  until they&#39;re tired find no <br/>
thrill in staying up just for the sake of staying  up.  If they&#39;re not doing <br/>
something they want to do more than they want to  sleep, they&#39;ll go to bed.<br/>
