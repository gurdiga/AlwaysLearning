<div id="ygrps-yiv-290644290">She just quit college.<br/>
She is feeling so lost and unsure of who she is and what she wants or how to find either.<br/>
Carly was an unschooled child after we decided not to send her to 2nd grade, until she decided to try highschool at 9th grade.<br/>
She went back to school 2 years after her brother died.  I dont know if she would have gone if he was still here.  <br/>
It left a 6 year gap between her and her younger siblings and parents trying their best to cope with devastating grief.  <br/>
She mostly liked high school.  <br/>
The theater department, learning French, going to dances and football games were the highlights.  <br/>
It was very interesting to watch and listen to this unschooled child go through this system.  <br/>
She told me everything about her days and her opinions and mostly I felt she was having a positive experience.<br/>
Then slowly and subtly I started noticing a change in her.   She really cared what the status quo was and started figuring out<br/>
how to do as little as possible to get the grade.  Her passion for learning was slipping away and it became more about just getting by.<br/>
Senior year came and she wanted to go to college.  I tried to get her to take a year and travel/work, but that&#39;s not &quot;how it is done&quot;.<br/>
We spent a year looking for colleges and applying and she got accepted and chose one.<br/>
We couldn&#39;t pay for it all, so we got grants and loans for her.   She was going to major in acting.  <br/>
She wanted to experience theater at the college level.   Well she experienced it.  She had a pretty good freshman year, but wasn&#39;t thrilled about <br/>
going back after the summer.  She didn&#39;t know what she would do here at home, so she went.  She was in a production, got into the theater fraternity,<br/>
and was passing her classes.  But, she was miserable.  She seemed to be slipping into a depression.  She hated the classes that she had to take<br/>
that were required, not her choosing.  Then she even started resenting the classes she use to enjoy.  After Christmas break, she was saying she <br/>
didn&#39;t think she would go back for her Junior year.  She was planning on finishing this semester though.  She went back and things got worse.  <br/>
She didn&#39;t want to leave her room most of the time.  She did meet a boy over Christmas break and that seemed to lift her spirits, but he lives here, so she <br/>
started coming home on weekends (she was 3 hrs away).  It got harder and harder for her to return and she decided she really couldn&#39;t take <br/>
it anymore.  She did have to stay until March 22 to fulfill her grant requirement, or pay back $5000.00, so then she felt trapped and angry.<br/>
She is home now, and has absolutely no regrets about leaving, but still feels lost.  I keep telling her to take her time.  She needs to deschool!<br/>
She wrote this on her Facebook page so she didn&#39;t have to explain over and over why she was leaving.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m leaving. I&#39;m done. My experience here is over.  I&#39;m dropping out of college and I couldn&#39;t be happier! For all my friends who went to public, private or any type of school their whole lives, who took the SAT&#39;s, who applied for colleges, who strived for A&#39;s and academic successÂ…I understand your concern and difficulty understanding this decision. Growing up, most of us go through the system of, make good grades, get into a good college, get a good job and die after enjoying a nice retirement. My life&#39;s teachings were very different. I was unschooled for 8 years of my life. 2nd through 8th. And it was the best thing to ever happen to me. I was free to choose what I wanted to learn. My parents never expected A&#39;s because being a happy child and learning happily, on my own time, was what they saw as successful. I&#39;ve always been supported in my choices. I decided to go to public high school and my parents supported it. They constantly reminded me through it all, when I would get upset over a bad test or stress out over missing school, that the most important thing was my happiness. When I didn&#39;t want to do my homework, or didn&#39;t want to go to school that day, my mom would say &quot;then don&#39;t&quot; and that would be that. My success was on me, on what I felt was important. And I was successful! Honor roll, school plays, good grades, clubs, I achieved what I wanted, only because I wanted it. But it was never to get into a good college. It was never to prepare me for a job. It was solely to experience something new. Just like when I was home schooled I&#39;d learn through my experiences, on the sheer basis of learning for learning&#39;s sake. And so when I wanted to learn about college, to see what it was like. My parents supported that too. And I did it! I got into CNU! Not to become a doctor, lawyer, or even actress. I came to college to experience the &quot;now&quot; of it all, not to work towards my &quot;tomorrow&quot;. Unfortunately the &quot;now&quot; of school is no longer an experience I enjoy. I&#39;ve loved my time here and the people I&#39;ve met, but I&#39;ve lost myself in concern with deadlines on paper that don&#39;t matter to me, attendance in classes I didn&#39;t even want to take. My future is wide open and I&#39;m confident in myself enough to know that I&#39;ll be successful in achieving whatever I want to do, I always have been before. College does not determine a persons ability or intelligence. Yes it does help in the career field, but if I wanted a career and knew what I wanted to do with my life then I&#39;d stay in college and work for that. I&#39;m young, vibrant and excited to see the world, to be inspired and I&#39;m positive that wasting my money doing something that no longer excites me is in no way going to make me anymore eligible to be a successful career woman in the future. I am so confident in my decision to leave, because it is the first thing in a long time that I am completely 100 percent sure of. I am in no way trying to say that anyone else&#39;s choices are wrong or that going to college is bad. I&#39;m just trying to explain why this is right for me. I&#39;m not having a mental breakdown. I&#39;m not quitting because it&#39;s hard. I&#39;m not giving up. And I&#39;m not Prego! I&#39;m simply continuing on with my life by doing what makes me happy, and what is best for me. <br/>
-Carly &lt;3 <br/>
<br/>
This is the person she wants to be, but has so much anxiety for the future, she is blocking her own path. <br/>
<br/>
She got some good comments from her friends, but has also experienced others who just don&#39;t get it and are avoiding her.<br/>
<br/>
 I wish I could make it all better<br/>
for her.  All I can do is encourage, listen, and love.  I&#39;m worried she may be suffering depression (my mil takes meds for depression).<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully, it will just take some time.  She has always been a pessamistic type of person.  Loveable and hilarious, but has a dark view of things that I don&#39;t have.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I just thought I&#39;d share our story.  Unschooling doesn&#39;t seem to have a down side when described on these list and it&#39;s probably true!  But life can get in the way sometimes.  Our childrens choices <br/>
may be ones we don&#39;t agree with.    It wont make everything perfect.  But, I am so grateful it&#39;s the path we chose.  And I think Carly will find<br/>
her way, and hopefully it wont be a long journey, since she knows where it can lead.<br/>
<br/>
This does leave me wondering if I should try even harder to discourage my younger 2 from going to highschool if they start expressing interest.<br/>
Maybe step up the traveling adventures when that time comes.....</div>

 </span></blockquote>She doesn&#39;t sound depressed in that facebook post, though. She sounds <br/>
the complete opposite, like she was previously feeling depressed and <br/>
beaten down by what she&#39;d gotten herself into and that now she feels <br/>
she&#39;s taken control and is tremendously relieved. I realize that some of <br/>
that post is probably bravado, but, still, it really sounds strong and <br/>
clear-headed.<br/>
<br/>
You know what to do - support her interests, make your family life as <br/>
interesting and sweet as possible. Give her a nice long time to <br/>
deschool. Help her decompress. Travel a bit, sing, play games, cook good <br/>
foods, watch good movies, and all that. Help her connect with her <br/>
younger siblings really a lot - enlist her help with being an <br/>
unschooling big sister to them. Go camping. Maybe go to some unschool <br/>
conferences - hanging around with the unschooling parents might be <br/>
helpful for her. I wonder if she&#39;d be willing to speak about her <br/>
experiences in school - from the perspective of having been an <br/>
unschooler. That might be really helpful for her to sort through all her <br/>
mixed feelings and confusions. She might like reading, &quot;How I Became an <br/>
Autodidact.&quot; I haven&#39;t read it, but Rosie has read it several times and <br/>
loves it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d guess what will be hard for her for a while is not feeling like <br/>
she&#39;s &quot;doing something.&quot; She&#39;s got quite a few years behind her of <br/>
others telling her what to do and getting &quot;credit&quot; for doing things. It <br/>
makes sense for her to feel adrift, without that, for a while.<br/>
<br/>
Since she&#39;s into theater - maybe she can audition for some local shows? <br/>
That would give her time some structure with a product at the end, which <br/>
might help her feel better.<br/>

I don&#39;t think she sounds depressed on her Facebook, either.  It sounds like she&#39;s sorting through it and working it out.  It sounds like she knows what she doesn&#39;t want, which leaves the path ahead clear and not full of doubt about leaving.  <br/>
<br/>
And as a humorous aside, my 9 year old daughter read your daughter&#39;s FB entry and said to me, &quot;I don&#39;t want to go to college either - it&#39;ll take too much time away from the stuff I&#39;m REALLY interested in.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I wish I&#39;d had both their confidence levels (not to mention the understanding, encouragement and support you mention in your post) when I left college at nineteen and spent the next several years being branded an underachiever and a quitter by my family members and friends, reminded at every turn that I didn&#39;t have that &quot;all-important&quot; piece of paper!<br/>

Can you step up the traveling adventures now?  Is there somewhere  <br/>
Carly would like to go?  Going there now, &quot;during the semester,&quot; might  <br/>
be a big healing leap.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1891806494">Joanna, I loved reading Carly&#39;s Facebook post. She figured out what wasn&#39;t working for her and made the choice to not continue doing it, and it was a big decision! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
===This does leave me wondering if I should try even harder to discourage my younger 2 from going to highschool if they start expressing interest.===<br/>
<br/>
I think that would be unfair to them; why shouldn&#39;t they have the same choice Carly had? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
===Maybe step up the traveling adventures when that time comes===<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s not possible for your family to do this now, are there some unschooling families you know with whom Carly could spend a little time, much as Holly Dodd has done?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>She wasn&#39;t when she wrote it.  She felt exhilerated and free!  She said she laughed and giggled on and off the whole drive home from school.  That lasted a few days then the &quot;now what&quot; set in.  We&#39;ve had a few long talks and she is already feeling better.  <br/>
I think Pam was right.  Too much time with being told what was expected of her.  She fell into all the trappings of school even with parents who didn&#39;t buy into it and kept the door of freedom open.<br/>
I&#39;ll ask her about maybe speaking about her experiences.<br/>
Sandra, we already have a trip planned for NYC in a couple of weeks.  She is very excited to see a friend of hers perform in a production at Pace Univ.  We are also talking about saving up to go to Ireland.  That may take a couple of years, and I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll have a lot more smaller trips before that.<br/>
She was doing much better yesterday and this morning.  I think the weather getting nicer is helping too.  It sure is helping me!<br/>

If she&#39;s a writer, another unschooled teen shared her knowledge that in Ireland, writers don&#39;t have to pay taxes.  So, if that&#39;s what she&#39;s into and doing, she could probably live and work on the cheap!<br/>

American writers living in Ireland don&#39;t have to pay taxes?<br/>
Americans can write there, but without a work visa I don&#39;t think they  <br/>
can make any money there.  Tourist visas keep the person all-American  <br/>
(legally speaking).<br/>
<br/>
But if she&#39;s writing about things she sees and does in Ireland, some  <br/>
of her expenses could be tax deductible.<br/>

I&#39;m not sure really, but it seems anyone qualifies as long as they reside in Ireland and meet the exemption status of what Ireland considers art.  Much debate over that one!<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s an article that I found about it, which implies that people can move to Ireland and get tax exempt status, but that wasn&#39;t how the law was intended.... It was intended to keep Irish artists from leaving the country.<br/>
