&lt;&lt; I realize that often the reasons are very complex however I&#39;ve always <br/>

There is a lot that society feeds our young women also....messages that are <br/>
conflicting that can contribute to these type of problems.<br/>

does make one aware of some of the conflicting messages our society sends <br/>
young women today.<br/>
