 </span></blockquote>I would recommend no other books. She likes that one. There&#39;s  <br/>
something magical about the character and how the character is  <br/>
relating to the situation if she wants to read it over and over. That  <br/>
can&#39;t be duplicated.<br/>
<br/>
I know it seems counter to what&#39;s said about expanding on their  <br/>
interests! But at 2 she&#39;s not interested in meditation really. She&#39;s  <br/>
interested in that book.<br/>
<br/>
There were several special books that my daughter loved when very  <br/>
young and we tried others in the series with the same characters but  <br/>
whatever she found special in them wasn&#39;t in the others. (When she was  <br/>
older that changed and she did want to explore more with the same  <br/>
characters.)<br/>
<br/>
I could be wrong but it&#39;s something to keep in mind. If you come  <br/>
across another meditation book, you could throw it into the mix and  <br/>
let her choose if she wants to read it. But I think it&#39;s far more  <br/>
likely her interest is in animal characters that spark something in her.<br/>

Please proofread before posting.  The archives of Always Learning will be here for a long, long time.  Those who read the first day, though, should be able to read and understand easily.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps your husband should read Peaceful Piggy Meditation to her, and you should buy a copy to have around.<br/>
