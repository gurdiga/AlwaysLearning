&gt;Have you checked out Straw Bale houses?  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks Heidi.  Uh, I don&#39;t think WA is all that cold<br/>
though.  Where do you live, Tahiti?  LOL  <br/>
<br/>
As for the Straw Bale, we are students of Natural<br/>
Building.  That includes a lot of different techniques<br/>
which we intend to use in hybrid combinations as<br/>
fitting for each site, available materials, choices of<br/>
the builders/homeowners, and season in which each is<br/>
built.  They include: strawbale, recycled plastic or<br/>
paper bale, cob, adobe, rammed earth and earth<br/>
berming, round wood and raw wood, cord wood, ferro<br/>
cement, earthship methods, and others.  <br/>
<br/>
The earth bermed cottage I mentioned is on a slight<br/>
slope and the berming is on the side where the cottage<br/>
is being cut into the slope of the hill.  The<br/>
reamaining walls will likely be cob, or a combination<br/>
of cob and other materials.  Cob is an adobe like<br/>
process, where the material is sculpted in place<br/>
instead of dried as bricks first.  That is what all<br/>
those whitewashed, thatch roofed cottages in the UK<br/>
are made of.  <br/>
<br/>
Cob has terrific thermal mass, similar concerns to<br/>
footing and roof (boots and hat) to strawbale, and is<br/>
very condusive to curvilinear construction, sculpted<br/>
architectural details, built in benches, shelves, etc,<br/>
and injecting personality into the design.  You can<br/>
inset a piece of glass into cob and sculpt the cob<br/>
into any shape you want around it for a non opening<br/>
window.  You can even build an &quot;adobe&quot; type oven into<br/>
the cob, to heat a home with.  The thermal mass makes<br/>
it function great for slow burns, and slow release of<br/>
stored heat.<br/>
<br/>
We favor cob for the reasons above, as well as the<br/>
fact that it stands up well to damp climates like<br/>
Ireland, Devonshire, Wales and New Zealand.  Cob homes<br/>
have been continuously occupied in places in the UK<br/>
for over 500 years.  It is untouched by earthquakes,<br/>
and totally fireproof as well.  It is structually self<br/>
supporting, drying to an almost concrete hardness, but<br/>
can be cut later with a power saw if you need to add<br/>
onto a house, etc.  It&#39;s very versatile, extremely low<br/>
impact environmentally, great thermally, and very<br/>
cheap to build.  All you need is the appropriate<br/>
portions of sand, clay and straw mixed.<br/>
<br/>
One more passion of mine.  Natural Learning, Natural<br/>
Building, Natural Birthing, Natural Eating, Natural<br/>
Living....hmmmm, do I see a theme here?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I am new to this group and I am really enjoying the discussions for <br/>
the week or two that I have been following them.  We are near San <br/>
Diego, and yes, Washington would probably seem freezing to us!  My <br/>
sister has been building her &quot;house&quot; in the Texas desert with <br/>
several different natural building techninques.  She has a great <br/>
website with photos of her journey every step of the way. <br/>
(Twistedroad.com).  My daughters (3 and 5) love looking at the <br/>
photos, and we have even tried our hand at making our own little mud <br/>
building bricks right in the backyard.  (Just big enough for bug <br/>
houses.  Actually, two of my sisters are doing this, but only one <br/>
has a website as of now.<br/>
Anyway, I have spent the past couple of years reading every <br/>
education book, website, newsletter, etc. that I could get my hands <br/>
on, and it seems all my &quot;research&quot;  just brings me right back to <br/>
what I was doing in the first place...reading to my kids, building <br/>
forts, going to the library, digging in garden..etc.  I hate putting <br/>
a label on myself, but whatever it is we are doing is working great <br/>
and we&#39;re not going to change any time soon.  It is comforting to <br/>
know you are all out there! My family thinks I&#39;m nuts, but we have a <br/>
nice unschooling community here in San Marcos.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1007653810">Ok, I lied.  <br/>
Christian Bruyere and Robert Inwood&#39;s  book is called &quot;In Harmony with<br/>
Nature: Creative Country Construction&quot;.  They are not two separate<br/>
titles.  <br/>
The other book I was thinking of isn&#39;t by the same author at all and it&#39;s<br/>
only an excerpt from that old Woodstock Craftsman&#39;s Manual, which is a<br/>
cool book with line drawings about all kinds of stuff, not building,<br/>
except for maybe tipi&#39;s.  <br/>
Sorry.   Big time brain fog here...<br/>
<br/>
Deb L, hopeful this is the right list.</div>

<br/>
You&#39;re close! &quot;A Reverence for Wood&quot; by Eric Sloan ISBN 0-345-31991-5 as<br/>
well as some of his other books (he authored at least 23 books) can be<br/>
purchased at many of the big box book stores and their virtual stores on<br/>
the web.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and enjoy.<br/>

Hi Sandra,<br/>
  <br/>
  Thanks for sending us your questions. As soon as we can, we&#39;ll get<br/>
back to you. In the meantime, you might want to keep this email as a<br/>
handy reference to our correspondence.<br/>

 I&#39;m looking for information on a book I owned in the old hippie days,<br/>
called (I think) &quot;The Love of Wood&quot; or something like it.  Ink drawings,<br/>
hand lettered, about traditional construction, trees, making hooks from<br/>
certains types of branches (building from tree-parts, not just all<br/>
finished lumber).  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I look online but can&#39;t remember enough to look for it!  I<br/>
gave it away years ago thinking I could easily find another copy.  <br/>
<br/>
I think the author had done three or four books, but I only ever had the<br/>
one.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t know, can you suggest someone who probably has all the<br/>
woodworking books he&#39;s ever owned who might be able to ID this for me?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra<br/>

PROBLEM:<br/>
Very expensive.<br/>
<br/>
$15 and $20 used with loose pages, $30 and $45 used in paperback without <br/>
loose pages (but how long before that 1970 glue dries up? &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Amazon had what I HOPE is a typo--they&#39;re taking orders for a new edition, <br/>
$15 or so (I forget numbers; sorry), and they say December 2012 but I&#39;m <br/>
hoping they really meant December 2002.<br/>
<br/>
If so, I can wait two months! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
