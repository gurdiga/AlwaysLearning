<div id="ygrps-yiv-398304983"><div dir="ltr">My son struggled to eat like that when he suffered from GERD (gastro-oesophegal reflux disorder). He was diagnosed at a few months old but suffered for years: it gave him heartburn when he swallowed anything. When it was bad, unless we gave him medication, he would only want icy, creamy, sweet stuff. He didn&#39;t know, for a long time, that it wasn&#39;t normal to feel uncomfortable when you ate anything.<br><br>My daughter, who was very small for her age, was exhausted by exercise and ate very little and mostly high-sugar chocolate-based things turned out to have a heart problem: easily fixed in the end, but it had a huge and lasting physical effect on her.<br><br>Don&#39;t assume that he&#39;s exhausted because he isn&#39;t eating enough, or that he can&#39;t eat because he doesn&#39;t like things.

Hi Sarah,</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin:0px 0px 1em;color:rgb(33, 33, 33);font-family:Georgia;font-size:15px;line-height:18.3px;">
==<span style="color:rgb(33, 33, 33);font-family:Georgia;font-size:15px;line-height:18.3px;">Does anyone out there have a child who was like this for years and then got past it?==<br>
<br>
I don&#39;t have a child who is like it, but I have a me who was a lot like that as a kid! I didn&#39;t eat much at all. My Mum says she chased me around putting chocolate in my mouth, and chocolate was one of the few things I ate. I was very small and skinny, and
 the doctor sent me to a medical place&nbsp;called a Sun Ray Centre in the 1970&#39;s (apparently really a bad thing, they&#39;ve since found out!) - it was supposed to be for &#39;delicate children&#39; and make you gain weight (it didn&#39;t work!).<br>
<br>
I can&#39;t remember why I didn&#39;t like most foods. I don&#39;t remember it being a texture thing, or having any kind of pain or anything. I just didn&#39;t like the taste, as far as I recall. Over the years I just started eating more things though. Probably by the time
 I was a teenager I was eating pretty much what other kids were eating, although I always ate way more chocolate than other kids until I was in my 20&#39;s.<br>
<br>
I wouldn&#39;t rule out something medical, as Bernadette said, but it *could* also just be a limited taste thing. I don&#39;t really remember being exhausted, even though I didn&#39;t eat a lot - so maybe that is something different to look in to?&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Ideas -&nbsp;Are there specific textures he tends to like more? Soft things? Or crunchy?&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Or is it that he just really prefers sweet things? Will he drink smoothies with ice cream and sweet fruits like berries in them, and a bit of honey? Do you make your own waffle batter - because that has plenty of protein from the eggs, and carbs from the flour.
 Will he pick at a monkey platter if it&#39;s left out? Does he like nuts? Can you put nuts in a smoothie, if he&#39;s more likely to drink stuff than eat it?&nbsp;<br>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-991842878">Just in case you haven’t tried monkey platters, consider that.  But SMALL ones.  Saucer-sized.  Maybe even the size of a whole hot dog is overwhelming to him.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My younger son -=-<br/>
<br/>
You didn’t say how old he is now, just that it had gone on since he was one.<br/>
<br/>
-=-This started when he was one, after he had to stop nursing in a traumatic way.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Breastmilk is very sweet and young children need that, so his preference for sweets isn’t surprising.  Maybe you could think of sweeter foods that are also protein.  Smoothies (but not a huge glass, just a small one).  Protein drinks, protein bars?<br/>
<br/>
If he’s still pretty young and you think it might be the trauma of whatever was happening when he stopped nursing, might sweet something in a baby bottle help?  We used baby bottles when my kids were sick in the bed, for juice or milk.<br/>
<br/>
Chocolate milk can seem substantial to a stomach, for a while (to stave off the hunger).<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/eating/monkeyplatter">http://sandradodd.com/eating/monkeyplatter</a><br/>
<br/>
Once when I asked for photos, people sent monkeyplatter photos, some of which seemed WAY too full of sweets for me.  But in this case, those photos might be good to consider.<br/>

<br/>
if he likes cheese and maybe a little sausage (way disguised, probably) you could make some of these, with honey, and apple or raisins or something sweet:<br/>

<br>
I was thinking chocolate milk too, as well as my ideas for sweet fruit smoothies. I make chocolate milk with Nutella (or any hazelnut/choc spread) - chuck it in the blender with some milk. Tastes awesome and a bit more protein to fill them up from the nuts.<br>
<br>
Does he like cookies? Oatmeal choc chip cookies are great - lots of protein and fiber - we just followed the recipe on the&nbsp;Quaker Oats lid, but put in choc chips instead of raisins!&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.quakeroats.com/cooking-and-recipe/vanishing-oatmeal-raisin-cookies.aspx" id="ygrps-yiv-78784966LPlnk305700" title="http://www.quakeroats.com/cooking-and-recipe/vanishing-oatmeal-raisin-cookies.aspx

I was thinking chocolate milk too, as well as my ideas for sweet fruit smoothies. I make chocolate milk with Nutella (or any hazelnut/choc spread) - chuck it in the blender with some milk. Tastes awesome and a bit more protein to fill them up from the nuts.<br>

He does not have to be young!! I have no shame in saying that I not only drank, ask my mother to make it for me and made myself a bottle with milk and baby cereal ( farinha lactea- sold in Brazil and very very sweet) pretty much every morning until I was like 13!!<br/>
<br/>
Heck I would drink it today! And I wanted it in a bottle! It gave me a warm feeling to wake up sucking that bottle. It made me feel wonderful!<br/>
<br/>
I can still remember the feeling! Yep I am 50!<br/>

And the small amounts taken in that way, gradually, might be helpful if it is digestive problems.  Sometimes people’s digestive systems aren’t finished developing when they’re born and it can take a few years.  It might be something that requires surgery, of course, for sure—but there are also systems that are still maturing, through childhood.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1447956061">My daughter, now 9.5, has a very limited palate. She eats a lot of<br/>
sweets, and sweet is her preferred flavor :-)<br/>
<br/>
While researching what might be causing her palate to be so specific<br/>
(sweets, ham, bacon, a particular gluten free bread, rice), I found a<br/>
link between iron deficiency and a shrinking palate. She used to eat a<br/>
wider variety of foods, including carrots, watermelon, grapes,<br/>
cauliflower, and sometimes bits of broccoli, so getting down to just the<br/>
sweets, ham, and limited other white foods was a bit alarming.<br/>
<br/>
My pediatrician confirmed that an iron deficiency can cause the taste<br/>
buds to accept fewer and fewer things. I have not had her tested,<br/>
because right now, she is terrified of the idea. Thankfully, my<br/>
pediatrician is very supportive of our unschooling life approach, and is<br/>
fine with not doing the blood test for iron deficiency.<br/>
<br/>
If your child is willing, you might consider testing for this, and<br/>
having your child tested for food allergies. Food allergies can account<br/>
for a lot of food aversions in children.<br/>

<br/>
Why test?<br/>
If it might be an iron deficiency, give her iron supplements for a while.  <br/>
<br/>
If the child in the original question is strong enough and healthy enough, and young, and there ARE many foods available, let’s not scare the mom into thinking there’s something terribly wrong with him. <br/>
<br/>
And suggestions of medical intervention (alternative or otherwise) are probably premature, and are not about unschooling.  People come here to discuss how unschooling can be affected, or can affect, the situations they bring, so please don’t treat this discussion as though the questions are “What in all the earth should I be considering?”  They can go elsewhere in all the earth to look for those ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Here, the topic should be what can be done normally, in terms of learning and relationships, acceptance, assistance, a positive and peaceful environment.  <br/>
<br/>
If the mom hasn’t had bread around, that might be another thing a six year old would eat.  Anytime a parent’s special diet is applied to a young child, that can be a problem.  Children NEED sweet foods to grow.  If he would like anything in the form of nutella, peanut butter, jam, on bread and that has NOT been an option, the mother is unnaturally limting his options, and his learning, and perhaps his health.<br/>
<br/>
Deb Lewis brought this do a discussion years ago.  The title the editors put on says “might,” but the details in the article are not “might be.”<br/>
<br/>

Here is more, on my site<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/sugar">http://sandradodd.com/sugar</a><br/>
<br/>
For any parent reading here who thinks children are harmed by sugar, or that most people are harmed by gluten, there is a condition parents are succumbing to lately, in the hundreds of thousands of people, or millions.  It’s a disorder like anorexia, or bulimia, but it can affect the whole family directly—it can cause divorces, and cause the children not to trust the parents (for good reason):  orthorexia.  It is the belief (false) that there are foods that will immediately do severe damage, and that even touching them can harm you, and that IF someone can control the (imagined) purity of foods they ingest, that they will have near-magical results)—intelligence, creativity, long life.   The belief is contagious, especially to people who are fearful or gullible.  It harms unschooling, because it’s illogical and extreme and ends up involving shame and control (if it hasn’t already started there).<br/>
<br/>
If a parent focusses on food as dangerous, dirty, alarming, deadly—that can be passed on to children, even vaguely, in the mood of the kitchen.   <br/>

I used to make Popsicles a lot. When we lived in the city we had a milkman and they had this berry flavored juice that was SO good. I&#39;d mix in some frozen berries and I loved them as much as the kids. Tasted like summer. You could dissolve some plain gelatin in the juice first for some flavorless protein. I took the addition of other foods too far with the Popsicles and I don&#39;t recommend that! That&#39;s been a long time ago now, though. I have inspired myself - think I&#39;m going to go look for our Popsicle mold and try to find some really tasty juice! Or - pudding pops? Chocolate milk frozen is good, too.<br/>

Like ADD for kinesthetic activities. :-)<br/>
<br/>
School’s definition of ADD is about passive listening to a teacher droning on.  The real disorder would be someone who COULD listen attentively to something boring (or at least fake doing so) for twelve years.    [I suppose worksheets and read-the-chapter-and-answer-the-questions are included in ADD complaints by schools.]<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps people who can and do run if they don’t want to, or swim if they don’t want to, without getting tired, can make good marines.   People who can listen to things they don’t want to listen to…. I don’t know what job would be good for them.<br/>
<br/>
People who can eat what doesn’t seem good to them, that doesn’t appeal to them—that doesn’t seem healthy, either.  if someone eats just enough and stops, but there is still food available, that could be good judgement and we shouldn’t be measuring—just making an assortment of food easily available, I think.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1205673038">-- that IF someone can control the (imagined) purity of foods they ingest, that they will have near-magical results)—intelligence, creativity, long life. --<br/>
<br/>
My daughter has always preferred sweet and starchy foods. She also has asthma & allergies. I went through a period for a few years where I tightly controlled our food in hopes that doing so would improve my daughter&#39;s health.  Well guess what- controlling her diet never did resolve her health issues but controlling her food definitely created conflict in our relationship. <br/>
<br/>
When we started unschooling I stopped my controlling and she started exploring all of the foods that had been previously forbidden. For over a year she ate those previously forbidden foods almost exclusively and had no interest in the foods that she ate during the controlled period. We would search the aisles of the grocery store looking for foods that appealed to her. We bought variety packs so she & her brother could try lots of different things. <br/>
<br/>
I would promise her that I was never going to go back to controlling her food and she would look me dead in the eye and say &quot;I don&#39;t believe you.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
It took a long time and a pattern of being trustworthy to earn her trust back. Eventually she returned to choosing foods because they felt and tasted good, not because they had been previously forbidden. Once her emotions around food finally settled back down I realized that she was choosing basically the same foods that she&#39;d chosen during her pre-controlled years. <br/>
<br/>
She has always known what her body needs more than I have. That makes sense since she&#39;s the one living in it!<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the biggest thing I&#39;ve noticed with this experience - when I stopped controlling her food and started implementing unschooling principles HER HEALTH GOT BETTER.  Asthma symptoms decreased and became less intense.  Her skin used to be dry & have little bumps on it and it gradually became soft and smooth. *** As her life became easier and happier her health improved. ***  <br/>
<br/>
Emotions have a huge effect on health. Instead of focusing energy on controlling and bringing balance it is more effective to focus on bringing joy, acceptance and laughter.  <br/>
