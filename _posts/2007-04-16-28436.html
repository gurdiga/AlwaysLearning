<div id="ygrps-yiv-1731593487">My son Lukas (5 1/2 yo.) is very distressed when we take him out in<br/>
public and of course people look. He says&quot; why are they looking at me?&quot;<br/>
He will walk around me or dh in circles trying to get out of sight,he<br/>
will walk on our toes or want us to pick him up. I sometimes tell him<br/>
they are looking because he&#39;s so cute or people looking isn&#39;t going to<br/>
hurt you or maybe the little kid wants to be your friend.<br/>
To which he will reply&quot; I don&#39;t want them too be my friend&quot;<br/>
needless to say my husband and i don&#39;t know why Lukas is suffering so<br/>
from people looking at him.<br/>
When i took him into the kids section he freaked out because some<br/>
girls on the computers looked at him. He says loudly&quot;why are they<br/>
looking at me?&quot; and wants to leave.<br/>
what insight can you give us about this...what can we do?thanks.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-22248115">My daughter, 6, has been sensitive about attention for some time.  Not quite to the extent that your son is perhaps but surely close enough.  I do try to realize it&#39;s just who she is, sensitve to certain things as I and her dad and even her brother are.  At an age when they are just learning to understand their anonymity it is understandable that their feelings are difficult for them to deal with.  Is he sensitive about other things?  It&#39;s probobly best to acknowledge his feelings and provide a strong presence for him.
