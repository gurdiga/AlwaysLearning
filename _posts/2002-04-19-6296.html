<div id="ygrps-yiv-58458157">&lt;&lt; As soon as she turned 18, she quit asking permission and just<br/>
 started announcing that she was going to do something or go somewhere. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Hmmmmm...my kids have already made THAT transition!!!! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Kirby and Marty are making that transition a little early for me, but they <br/>
are very honest and responsible, and I remind them that they might want to <br/>
ask to make sure I wasn&#39;t planning something different.  They usually do ask. <br/>
 Or they will ask early in the day if there&#39;s anything they need to be doing <br/>
for the rest of the day, and base their decisions on that.<br/>
<br/>
I have all their friends&#39; names, phone numbers, cell phone numbers, and <br/>
sometimes their moms&#39; work numbers and e-mail addresses!  The network can <br/>
find them if they&#39;re quickly needed. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
