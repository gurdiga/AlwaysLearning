I had some scattered pages and one I had forgotten about, and I  <br/>
wanted to link the list about partners (marriage-type), so I&#39;ve just  <br/>
built this and I need to leave for a few hours for a party.  If  <br/>
anyone has time and inclination to look at it and suggest other links  <br/>
from my pages, or other pages I might want to make, or if anyone has  <br/>
any short, good quotes from the partners list I could add to that in  <br/>
way of testimonial, that would be cool.<br/>
<br/>
Or if you just want to look at it and read the links without  <br/>
commenting to me, that&#39;s fine too.<br/>
