<div id="ygrps-yiv-511028651">Hi all<br/>
I just wanted to say thank you Sandra and everyone on this list. I am slowlyaking progress toward inschooling. First I want to share to points that have made things work for me that I learned here. 1.was to be more present with my 2 and 4 year old. Many issues with TV and fighting are settled when I or my wife make the time to be present and engaged 2. Make learning and things fun instead of setting hard rules. I used to force my 2 year old to brush even forcing the tooth brush in his mouth I felt it was better than cavities and the dentist. After reading and listening, I started changing my approach. I made the brush has a voice and it talked to my son and said how it loves to tickle his teeth and play with them. He thought this was funny and now loves to brush. Changes in attitude and perspective are switching everything. Thanks all!  Adam<br/>

Yes!  When people say it is a paradigm shift, that&#39;s hugely what it&#39;s about, but <br/>
also seeing the world differently, in general.<br/>
<br/>
In the details, it&#39;s the small things like making the living fun!  My 9 yr old <br/>
has been a late night person since about 3.  In the beginning of December she <br/>
got very sick and slept when she was sleepy.  Her whole schedule changed to <br/>
being up most of the night and falling asleep almost when the sun comes up. <br/>
 I&#39;ve struggled to try to help her shift it back, but with very little success. <br/>
 She&#39;ll get up for activities and be tired and STILL won&#39;t go to sleep any <br/>
earlier.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that big of a deal, except for my own attitude about not enjoying <br/>
sleeping in so late in the day.  That&#39;s MY thing though and instead of being <br/>
upset about it, I decided to help her explore her interest in astronomy, since <br/>
she loves the stars and constellations.  It seems a perfect opportunity to do <br/>
so, since you do that at night, and she&#39;s clear headed and awake!<br/>
<br/>
I could force her in bed or I can see the beauty in the night!  If I am tired, <br/>
then I can nap!  It&#39;s so much more peaceful than struggling to change something <br/>
that isn&#39;t so easily changed!<br/>
 <br/>
