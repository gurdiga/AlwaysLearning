<div id="ygrps-yiv-1618861388">Although this list is not directly related to unschoolers, I thought <br/>
it was cute nonetheless.  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
And somebody recommended to add the following items to the list in <br/>
honor of unschoolers...<br/>
 <br/>
#26.  Don&#39;t assume that just because the Dept of Education says <br/>
something is an important part of the curriculum, that it is <br/>
actually useful or necessary to learn.  After all, do you still know <br/>
the periodic table, all fifty capitals, all the presidents in order, <br/>
etc?<br/>
 <br/>
#27. Don&#39;t assume that all homeschoolers focus lots of energy on <br/>
spelling like those homeschooled children who win the spelling bees.<br/>
 <br/>
Kind regards,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-58646685">**#26.  Don&#39;t assume that just because the Dept of Education says something <br/>

<br/>
Many years ago my oldest daughter had a friend who was &quot;learning&quot; all the <br/>
state capitals in school, and thought Melissa should learn them too. My daughter <br/>
asked me if I thought she should learn them, and if I knew them all. I told <br/>
her that I was pretty sure that I still knew all the capitals, but that it <br/>
hasn&#39;t turned out to be a particularly useful thing for me to know except for <br/>
helping to win certain games. She decided she wanted to survey a lot of adults to <br/>
find out if they&#39;d ever learned the capitals, if they still knew them, and if <br/>
they had found it important or useful to know them. She asked everyone we ran <br/>
into for a week, and I also posted the questions on the AOL homeschooling <br/>
boards, which at the time were quite a busy place. It sparked a lot of interesting <br/>
discussion, online and off. <br/>
