Diana/hahamommy wants to discuss this somewhere.  We could discuss it  <br/>
on this list, if anyone wants to.  But it could also be discussed on  <br/>
the forum linked above.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, an idea I had presented is that the traditional  <br/>

something...)  assertion<br/>
&quot;If mama ain&#39;t happy, ain&#39;t nobody happy.&quot;<br/>
is a selfish cop-out, and lots of people will tell moms &quot;You have to  <br/>
take care of yourself first, &quot; and &quot;you have to be happy first&quot; or  <br/>
whatever all, but *I* think it can be supremely therapeutic to just  <br/>
be a good mom.   Being gentle and generous with a child of your own  <br/>
(your own production or your own choice) can be like being gentle and  <br/>
kind with the ghostly child within you, and that is nurturing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-946391437">I don&#39;t like those attitudes either.  I think it&#39;s healthy and good to  <br/>
recognize if we are slipping into that type of attitude.  It&#39;s so prevelant  in <br/>
society, it&#39;s almost ingrained in mothers now-days.  But sadly, it can  be the <br/>
truth!  If I&#39;m in a horrible mood, and not watching myself or my  attitude, if <br/>
I&#39;m having a pity party, the rest of the house CAN be  miserable.  I think it&#39;s <br/>
the &quot;reason&quot; for mama not being happy that you  have to examine. <br/>
 <br/>
Is it because we&#39;re listening to those voices saying, &quot;You have to be happy  <br/>
first&quot; or &quot;You deserve more than this&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m the only one that cares about  <br/>
this house!  Grrrr!!!&quot;  If we can recognize that we&#39;re listening to  those <br/>
voices instead of looking at why we&#39;re really feeling down we can nip it  early.  <br/>
That helps me a lot.  If I&#39;m really tired, if my body is  saying &quot;Sleep!!&quot; I <br/>
listen.  I will get the kids busy doing something, and  sleep.  I don&#39;t care <br/>
if it&#39;s 7:00 in the evening, I&#39;ll go take an hour nap  then just stay up late.  <br/>
If I don&#39;t feel good, I&#39;ll take some vitamins, or  sit down with a cup of <br/>
coffee or tea and internet a little while.  Eat a  bananna.  If the house is a <br/>
humongous wreck I&#39;ll ask for a little help, or  sometimes just get the kids busy <br/>
with something and do a quick clean-up.  <br/>
 <br/>
That whole &quot;If Mama ain&#39;t happy&quot; thing reminds me of the big movement  in the <br/>
70&#39;s for people to &quot;find themselves.&quot;  Looking back on that, I  believe that <br/>
attitude was responsible for many people walking out on their  families and <br/>
kids.  People just never feeling contented in themselves and  their roles.  <br/>
People listening to the world telling them they needed, they  DESERVED much more.<br/>

Here&#39;s what I wote at unschooling.info:<br/>
<br/>
I never toook it as &quot;mama needs her needs met first&quot; but as &quot;when I&#39;m <br/>
happy and in a peaceful place, it makes everyone&#39;s life better&quot; kind of <br/>
quote.<br/>
<br/>
So I work hard to keep myself at peace and joyful. My joy is hugely <br/>
contagious and often keeps the family in a good place. At those times <br/>
when I&#39;m overly *cooked*, it comes through my pores and affects others. <br/>
Maybe because I&#39;m SOOO connected to each member of the family--maybe <br/>
because I&#39;m so present---I don&#39;t know. But it &quot;pays&quot; for me to do my <br/>
best to stay calm and peaceful and full of joy. It makes a HUGE <br/>
difference here.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2044237923">And responding to my own post... &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I say &quot;if mama ain&#39;t happy, ...&quot; a lot.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t expect *others* though (particularly my family) to make me <br/>
happy. I *do* make sure that I give myself---or rather make room for--- <br/>
what I *need* on a regular basis. Incense/candles in the den and <br/>
kitchen. Some time outside in the garden every day. A weekly massage. <br/>
My animals nearby to touch and snuggle with. A little time all alone <br/>
each day/week.<br/>
<br/>
These things were harder to accomplish when the boys were little. MUCH <br/>
easier now. Plus, I can *ask* for help when I know what I need. And I <br/>
think *knowing* what I *need* is extremely important. As is knowing I <br/>
can ask for help.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the original quote was *meant* to be &quot;make me happy!&quot;---but that <br/>
wasn&#39;t how I saw it---nor is it how I interpret it now.<br/>
<br/>
If *this* mama ain&#39;t happy, she needs to get off her butt and change <br/>
the situation asap.<br/>

movement in the<br/>
70&#39;s for people to &quot;find themselves.&quot; Looking back on that, I believe  <br/>
that<br/>
attitude was responsible for many people walking out on their  <br/>
families and<br/>
kids.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
The pendulum swung WAY, way past the middle there.<br/>
<br/>
Women were being treated horribly before that, but there seems to  <br/>
have been a bit TOO much of &quot;You deserve to be happy,&quot; voice by  <br/>
people who were very VERY vague on what that &quot;happiness&quot; might need  <br/>
to entail.  Many kids were left without families in those days.  And  <br/>
many of the women suffered tons of regret and guilt, but there was no  <br/>
market for discussing that.<br/>
<br/>
I saw a lot of families succumb to the odd pressures of the 1970&#39;s,  <br/>
though, and I had a three year marriage and divorce, and that divorce  <br/>
came WAY, way too casually, with lots of people saying &quot;sure, LEAVE!&quot;  <br/>
happily, like there was a fad for everyone to leave everything.  It  <br/>
wasn&#39;t healthy.<br/>
<br/>
And so when, on message boards and discussion lists, women start  <br/>
saying &quot;Oh, well, then LEAVE!&quot; I bristle up quickly because of  <br/>
memories of many people&#39;s regrets, and how simple and effortless it  <br/>
is for a woman to say &quot;I would leave if I were you,&quot; or &quot;We&#39;ll  <br/>
support you if you leave.&quot;  But a woman who leaves instead of fixing  <br/>
the situation leaves and still has herself, and finds she also still  <br/>
has her kids (half time) and still has her husband (with an ex- added  <br/>
on, and no direct access anymore, and very little influence).  Plus  <br/>
she has a ton of bills and owes a lawyer.  Welcome to &quot;happier.&quot;   <br/>
Probably not.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No matter where you go, there you are.&quot; (some philosophical Buddhist  <br/>
thing)<br/>
&quot;You cannot run from your own bung hole.&quot; (Cornholio)<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know how the original was intended, but I&#39;ve seen it used in  <br/>
ways that aren&#39;t respectful of children&#39;s needs, and though candles  <br/>
and pampering can help a little, I think when moms put the kids off  <br/>
with the intent of her getting happier, it rarely works out well.   <br/>
Some people get jobs so they&#39;ll be happy, or go on vacations without  <br/>
their kids so they&#39;ll be happy (they think), but whatever ends up  <br/>
distancing them from their kids ends up with more unhappiness than  <br/>
happiness in the long run.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I guess I&#39;d have a different take on this if I&#39;d heard<br/>
it growing up. I never heard it until recently, so I<br/>
took it to mean, &quot;Don&#39;t blame the kids for your bad<br/>
mood--they&#39;re not going to feel better until you get<br/>
yourself under control.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
For me it&#39;s a reminder that I really am the emotional<br/>
leader of the family, and that wherever I&#39;m leading<br/>
the family is really pretty likely to follow.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about taking care of yourself, yes, but it&#39;s also<br/>
about taking responsibility for you emotions.<br/>
<br/>
As a nurse, I&#39;m frequently reminding family members<br/>
that they have to take care of themselves (showers,<br/>
time to eat, etc.--not taking off for Hawaii) even<br/>
while taking care of their loved one.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-419619943">This quote used to be over the desk of someone I worked with as a <br/>
social worker about 12 years ago.  She was in charge of the parent <br/>
aide program.  They paired volunteer parent mentors with mothers who <br/>
were struggling with many different issues.  <br/>
<br/>
I remember asking her about it once, because I was thinking about <br/>
the connotation that the mom was to blame for all the problems. She <br/>
said, however, that she kept it there as a reminder. When she felt <br/>
lost while assessing a myriad of issues in a family, she would start <br/>
with the mom.  Stabilizing her first, if possible, was often the <br/>
quickest way to affect positive change in the family.<br/>
<br/>
So, that was a fair use of that phrase.  But I often feel it is used <br/>
improperly and unfairly, as an excuse to shift the responsibility <br/>
for mom&#39;s happiness from herself to those around her.  <br/>
<br/>
As a social worker, I often found that the mother was blamed first <br/>
when things went wrong.  By everyone.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1834453517">My mom used that phrase often enough, and for her it meant that if  <br/>

God forbid we were happy when she was upset, because then we were  <br/>
unfeeling little brats who didn&#39;t appreciate all that she did for us.<br/>

I agree with the statements of everyone who said that moms feelings  <br/>
can very much affect others, and that they are a indicator of how the  <br/>
house is running. But that phrase has been used too much in the  <br/>
manner my mother did for it to ever be okay in my mind. It may be an  <br/>
easier way to say that mom&#39;s feelings affect others, and cutesie  <br/>
because everyone recognizes it, but it is insidious in that phrases  <br/>
like that tend to affect one&#39;s rational thinking, or even just  <br/>
subconscious attitude. My 2¢<br/>

<br/>
While I was reading e-mail just now, Holly was in there talking to me  <br/>
about some in-person thing that happened (not at all conference  <br/>
related, other people).<br/>
<br/>
She was with several kids and a mom, and they asked if another  <br/>
outside-the-family could spend the night the mom said &quot;No, I have  <br/>
things to do.&quot;  One kid muttered &quot;No, she doesn&#39;t&quot; and the mom heard  <br/>
or saw.   She said,  &quot;To question your mother is to question life  <br/>
itself.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Holly told me, &quot;She likes the power of being a mom, but she doesn&#39;t  <br/>
handle it very responsibly.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In discussing the tone and intent of the statement (Holly has known  <br/>
the whole family for a long time), she said she felt like the mom&#39;s  <br/>
attitude was  &quot;If I say it, it&#39;s true, and if I say it nice, then  <br/>
it&#39;s nice.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Pretty profound.<br/>
<br/>
I think maybe that&#39;s the way a lot of families are.  A soul-crushing  <br/>
statement made with a smile is assumed to have been a &quot;polite&quot;  <br/>
utterance.<br/>
<br/>

-=-I always looked at that phrase as an excuse for moms to be selfish.<br/>
LikeIts o.k. to leave the kids crying at home because they wish you<br/>
were<br/>
there because your week-end shopping trip with your girlfriends is<br/>
MUCH more<br/>
important.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
While I was reading e-mail just now, Holly was in there talking to me<br/>
about some in-person thing that happened (not at all conference<br/>
related, other people).<br/>
 <br/>
She was with several kids and a mom, and they asked if another<br/>
outside-the-family could spend the night the mom said &quot;No, I have<br/>
things to do.&quot;  One kid muttered &quot;No, she doesn&#39;t&quot; and the mom heard<br/>
or saw.   She said,  &quot;To question your mother is to question life<br/>
itself.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Holly told me, &quot;She likes the power of being a mom, but she doesn&#39;t<br/>
handle it very responsibly.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
In discussing the tone and intent of the statement (Holly has known<br/>
the whole family for a long time), she said she felt like the mom&#39;s<br/>
attitude was  &quot;If I say it, it&#39;s true, and if I say it nice, then<br/>
it&#39;s nice.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Pretty profound.<br/>
 <br/>
I think maybe that&#39;s the way a lot of families are.  A soul-crushing<br/>
statement made with a smile is assumed to have been a &quot;polite&quot;<br/>
utterance.<br/>
 <br/>
Holly said also that once there was a discussion about something not<br/>
even family related, some sort of news article or social situation<br/>
thing, and one of the kids said &quot;I disagree&quot; about a statement the<br/>
mom said--not a directive, not an opinion about anyone in the family,<br/>
and that the dad came back really fast and hard with &quot;Don&#39;t<br/>
contradict your mother.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
SHeeeesh...<br/>
 <br/>
