<div id="ygrps-yiv-1035646760">My Mil (who is really cool and we get along beautifully) just came <br/>
for a visit.  She almost always (yes, that&#39;s a true use of words <br/>
there) has questions or concerns about our lifestyle that we address <br/>
in a supportive manner.  We LIKE that she ask questions and she LIKES <br/>
that we give her information regarding her concerns.  After her <br/>
visits we typically send her weblinks that support our &#39;answers&#39;.  <br/>
<br/>
Here are two concerns she had that we need further information that <br/>
supports our decisions.  If anyone can supply website links, etc. we <br/>
would appreciate it. <br/>
<br/>
Here goesÂ…<br/>
<br/>
She is concerned with Tails being 11-years-old and co-sleeping.  She <br/>
thinks that it is/will inhibit Tails from being independent.  We have <br/>
only been able to find &#39;infant&#39; co-sleep info - is there anything <br/>
about older children and co-sleeping out there?<br/>
<br/>
She is concerned that Tails receives what we call `monthly money&#39; <br/>
(some would call it an allowance) and that we do not have required <br/>
chores in order for her to receive it.  Sandra&#39;s <br/>
(http://sandradodd.com/chores) is good but it doesn&#39;t really address <br/>
what Mil considers the receipt of `free money&#39;.   I also found <br/>
(http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/influencing%20kid%<br/>
20behavior/chores/tyingallowancetochores.html). <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any links that you can provide.  I&#39;m sure my Mil will <br/>
appreciate them.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-393868999">We have some friends in Pittsburgh who weren&#39;t unschoolers whose only child<br/>
co-slept until age 11.  She had her own room but frequently slept with one<br/>
or both of her parents.<br/>
<br/>
Karl is only 5, has his own room, and still sleeps with us the majority of<br/>
the time.  This summer he occasionally slept by himself just because a room<br/>
to himself was new and fun and exciting.  Now that it&#39;s winter, he almost<br/>
always sleeps with us.  He quit naps this year too.<br/>
<br/>
I think the concept of independence isn&#39;t near as important as the concept<br/>
of seeing one&#39;s options and making choices.  To make independence a sort of<br/>
&quot;have to&quot; kind of milestone or something like that is (to me) beside the<br/>
point.  For instance, Karl has begun announcing that he needs complete<br/>
privacy for going to the bathroom these days.  Some people would say that&#39;s<br/>
independence.  Maybe so.  I see it as suddenly realizing he doesn&#39;t want<br/>
company in the bathroom and creating personal space where it&#39;s *his* choice<br/>
to have space.  That&#39;s very different from the typical idea of encouraging<br/>
notions of independence before a child really even wants it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Kat slept in our room until she was 14. She had problems in the  <br/>
middle of the night a few times on sleep overs (though always went  <br/>
eagerly.) I&#39;m not sure how much longer sleeping with us would have  <br/>
gone on but we got ferrets and she decided to move into her bedroom  <br/>
with them when she was 14. The next summer, before she turned 15, she  <br/>
found a 2 week summer car design camp in Detroit she wanted to go to.  <br/>
Carl drove her out and dropped her off. (Not with out various qualms  <br/>
on our part, of course! That wasn&#39;t the least bit easy!) She had zero  <br/>
problems. She called us every night for the first few nights but then  <br/>
that dropped off. (It was a very intensive camp so she was very busy  <br/>
late at night.) She didn&#39;t even suffer homesickness. She flew back  <br/>
all on her own with a layover. She did another camp at 16 in  <br/>
Minneapolis with a week before stay with a friend in Chicago, flying  <br/>
by herself. Even so, no one would have claimed she showed any other  <br/>
signs of independence, eg, wanting to be out living on her own. It  <br/>
really wasn&#39;t until this year at 17 that she&#39;s talked in more  <br/>
independent terms.<br/>
<br/>
This outcome flies in the face of conventional so-called &quot;wisdom&quot; but  <br/>
it matches human nature better. Conventional wisdom says we need to  <br/>
make kids be independent. But that doesn&#39;t make sense. Children -- as  <br/>
with all animals -- are naturally dependent.  If kids feel to the  <br/>
core of their being that they have a solid foundation of  <br/>
unconditional support that will last as long as they need it, they  <br/>
can spend their time and energy exploring their world pushing their  <br/>
comfort level to their own personal edge. It&#39;s hard to explore when  <br/>
you&#39;re spending your time and energy worrying about the stability of  <br/>
your foundation and your personal safety.<br/>
<br/>
(Maslow&#39;s hierarchy of needs fits with that explanation:<br/>
http://tinyurl.com/6ujce)<br/>
<br/>
(Would *anyone* think it&#39;s a great idea for western scientists to  <br/>
swoop into a natural tribe and tell them they need to let go of their  <br/>
infants and toddlers and make them live their days with other kids  <br/>
and adult strangers? Would it even make sense to fear that because  <br/>
natural tribe families spend their days and nights together that  <br/>
generations of adults are still living with their parents, unable to  <br/>
let go? The tribes would have died out long ago if it weren&#39;t  <br/>
biologically natural to seek independence when it was biologically  <br/>
time to.)<br/>
<br/>
When humans and animals reach the equivalent of teen years, that need  <br/>
to be independent and do things on their own kicks in. They&#39;re hard  <br/>
wired that way: hormones or whatever start being produced and make  <br/>
them want to do things for themselves and on their own. Independence  <br/>
is perfectly natural when humans are late teens to early 20&#39;s. (It  <br/>
comes later and earlier to some, of course, just like walking and  <br/>
talking and reading.)<br/>
<br/>
When people are filled to the brim with what they need, they can let  <br/>
go when other needs come along. It&#39;s the kids who need to hold on but  <br/>
who feel pushed away with the overt or silent message of &quot;You need to  <br/>
be independent&quot; who hold on as long as they&#39;re allowed, trying to get  <br/>
their fill. That feeling of insecurity will interfere when the drive  <br/>
to be independent arrives. (Another way parents can interfere with  <br/>
independence besides pushing is filling kids with fear when the kids  <br/>
start making forays into independence)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The concept of needing to work for money is not brain surgery ;-)  <br/>
Unless parents never mention finances and lie about where the  <br/>
breadwinner goes each day, kids can&#39;t grow to adulthood without  <br/>
realizing that money doesn&#39;t come for free from an ATM ;-) They *are*  <br/>
going to grasp that they&#39;ll need a job for their own money. That need  <br/>
to have control over their lives, as well as what money comes in and  <br/>
how much goes out and where, is a part of natural independence.<br/>
<br/>
In the unnecessary process of teaching kids that they need to earn  <br/>
their money we can end up teaching them lessons we don&#39;t intend.  <br/>
They&#39;ll see that mom and dad share the money freely but are stingy  <br/>
when it comes to the kids. Unless there&#39;s barely enough money for  <br/>
basic necessities, kids really can&#39;t grasp that a lot of the money is  <br/>
for family maintenance and not &quot;free to do as your please money&quot;  <br/>
because all kids really see is parents freely choosing to spend money  <br/>
(and parents often do mix in &quot;free choice&quot; purchases too so shopping  <br/>
is rarely clear cut). It&#39;s not until they&#39;re adults with their own  <br/>
obligations that they can grasp that concept in an adult way. Until  <br/>
then they get a very different message than we intend.<br/>
<br/>
If we tie their money to chores ... well, there are a huge number of  <br/>
unintended lessons they learn that I&#39;ve talked about over the years.  <br/>
There are 15 pages (!) of the common concerns about chores at:<br/>
<br/>
http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/<br/>
<br/>
down the right hand side.<br/>
<br/>
Because we&#39;ve always helped her get what she needed, Kat doesn&#39;t feel  <br/>
needy for money. And, as a teen she&#39;s very conscious of spending  <br/>
money that she didn&#39;t contribute to earning. Not because we&#39;ve taught  <br/>
her that, but because it&#39;s time for her to see the world that way as  <br/>
she grows toward independence. How many conventionally parented teens  <br/>
can you hand $20 to who won&#39;t hope that mom and dad forget to ask for  <br/>
the change, or who might lie about how much something was so they can  <br/>
keep the change? Not because they&#39;re dishonest, but because they  <br/>
don&#39;t feel supported in their needs and the only way to get some  <br/>
independent money is covertly (or getting a job under pressure).<br/>

<br/>
Even though we gave our kids free money, and we bought them things  <br/>
pretty freely as we could afford to, they&#39;ve all been eager to have  <br/>
jobs and to have money, and they&#39;re all responsible with it.    I  <br/>
think it&#39;s the withholding of money, and stinginess, and limitations,  <br/>
that make kids grasping and dishonest and sneaky and desperate.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday Holly wanted her allowance and Keith told her she could go  <br/>
and get it out of his wallet.  Her allowance is $12.75.  He  has a  <br/>
change bowl on his desk.  Neither of us thought for a second that she  <br/>
would get $13, or $50.   Since they were really little, our kids   <br/>
have treated money as a family resource, just like anything else we  <br/>
had.  When they got big enough to go to the store alone, they&#39;d bring  <br/>
back the change and the receipt, not because they would be in trouble  <br/>
if they didn&#39;t, but just because it wasn&#39;t their money and they  <br/>
brought back the extra.  For years I&#39;ve said &quot;You can get something  <br/>
for yourself if you want to,&quot; and more often than not they don&#39;t, and  <br/>
when they do it&#39;s a single candy bar, or shampoo, or a bottle of  <br/>
chocolate milk maybe.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t say for sure why it happened, Crystal.  Some might be genetic/ <br/>
personality, but it might be something that would make your mom feel  <br/>
better.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-799924221">My link: human evolution<br/>
My supporting professional: YOU<br/>
<br/>
I know you are parenting your children the way that you FEEL is right, in your soul.  This is enough.  There does not need to be a &quot;supporting link&quot; for anyone, whether because it&#39;s fun to debate worthiness, or easier for them to sit with something if some &quot;professional or study&quot; can corroborate your parenting.  They don&#39;t have to agree.  I read that you and your mom or MIL like to debate these things--that&#39;s great!  But, I am just giving you my support basically and maybe a reminder that your soul and gut instinct in parenting IS the professional--it IS the study.<br/>
<br/>
When you look back upon our evolution, we co-slept for safety.  If you were alone at night, in the darkness, you were more apt to be eaten by predators.  Safety in numbers--safety in pairs.  This is still true-when your child or friend or husband or wife want to go shopping, you want them to be with someone.  It is safer.  Why (I ask) does our culture (and others) look down upon safety and comfort in numbers or pairs when it comes to simple things like sleeping?  OF COURSE it is safer, more comforting more__________(you pick the word) for children to share their sleep time with others.  Sometimes it&#39;s siblings and that&#39;s what works for the kids, usually it&#39;s parents.  It is in our very DNA, that we crave this extra safety and comfort in the darkness.   i think we deny our own evolutionary smarts by ignoring these automatic emotional needs.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have co-slept--with us or eachother, now both!  We have a king and 2 twins in our room for the 5 of us.  My oldest is 14, then 9 and 6, all boys.  My oldest would be sleeping in his own room if his room was right next to ours--but we live in a &quot;split&quot; plan (stupidist idea in the western world if you ask me!) and that move for him will wait until we move to a different house in the near future.  I think he would prefer his own room in that case, shared with his 9 year old brother--they&#39;ve done it before when we lived in a house set up &#39;properly&#39;--it was wonderful. But right now, my 9 year old likes to drift off holding my hand, my 6 year old likes snuggling between daddy and I and drifts off to story and song.  <br/>
<br/>
Frankly, some of our best discussions and communication is done in the bed late at night--all of us in the dark (somewhat) and the kids really connect with us and with eachother in ways that maybe the light of day inhibits.  These memories, this comfort, I am sure, will be the things we all hold on tight to throughout our lives.</div>

Mamachaos,<br/>
Although you did go on to be supportive, this beginning of your post  <br/>
is inappropriate for this list.  Many parents &quot;FEEL it is right in  <br/>
their souls&quot; to spank their children, to shame them, to ground them,  <br/>
to send them to school against their will and to punish them for not  <br/>
doing schoolwork.<br/>

I don&#39;t remember how often, exactly, but I know I was always welcome to <br/>
when I wanted to.  I was also considered very mature and independent by <br/>
most people who knew me.  I got my first job at 14, graduated high <br/>
school at 16, moved out at 17 and got married at 18.  <br/>
<br/>
My neice slept with her parents until she was 10.  She is now 12, <br/>
sleeping in her own room just fine, and recently went away to a 5 day <br/>
camp with no problems.  <br/>

for her age.  She will talk to anyone, and I can leave her in places <br/>
like church nurseries without any fuss, even if it&#39;s a new place.  <br/>
<br/>
All that to say that I don&#39;t believe that a kid sleeping with his or <br/>
her parent&#39;s is going to be still living with them at 30, which is <br/>
probably your MIL&#39;s fear.  Kid&#39;s who feel secure (at all times of day <br/>
and night) will be better prepared to go face the world.</div>

I wouldn&#39;t mind if some or all of my kids were living with me when  <br/>
they were past the tradition &quot;get out&quot; age.  Marty&#39;s about to turn 20  <br/>
and he&#39;s here.  Kirby would&#39;ve been here if he hadn&#39;t been offered a  <br/>
job in Texas.<br/>
<br/>
For all the attention that miles-per-gallon and emissions standards  <br/>
and plastic bags in landfills get, the idea of SO many people living  <br/>
in apartments alone, or so many little houses for one or two people  <br/>
doesn&#39;t get discussed much.<br/>

because of reading the book, Poisonwood Bible.  One of the characters<br/>
was lamenting because her youngest boy child wanted to sleep on his own<br/>
mat at a younger age than his older brothers had.  I think he was around<br/>
11 or so and his older brothers had stopped sleeping in the family bed<br/>
when they reached puberty.<br/>
<br/>
I found this article on Jan Hunt&#39;s website.  It&#39;s interesting.  I&#39;m not<br/>
sure it has the answers you want, but lots of intersting thoughts about<br/>
sleep...<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
It probably is more natural than seperate sleeping arrangements. <br/>
Chamille has on and off slept with us or her own room ever since she was<br/>
about 2.  I think people forget that as humans, we haven&#39;t always lived<br/>
in big multi-roomed houses.  Kids often slept together in one bed, or<br/>
slept in the same sleeping area as the parents.<br/>
<br/>
When my dad was born,  he had 3 older sisters, and his dad worked in a<br/>
logging camp.  His family lived in camp housing which consisted of a<br/>
basic 2 room cabin which had a kitchen/living area, and a bedroom, it<br/>
didn&#39;t even have a bathroom or running water.  It was VERY small.  I can<br/>
only imagine that there had to be co-sleeping in such a small space.  A<br/>
hundred years ago, it was more typical to have more children and live in<br/>
smaller spaces.<br/>
<br/>
Other cultures are different too.  My kids have been fascinated with the<br/>
movie, My Neighbor Totoro.  The girls who are about 6 and 11 both bathe<br/>
with their dad, in one big tub and they sleep on their mats together in<br/>
one room.  As I was trying to find information on co-sleeping with older<br/>
children, I ran across several references to Japanese culture that,<br/>
encourages extended co-sleeping up until 15 yrs of age, and also<br/>
ecourages multi-generational co-sleeping.  To sleep alone is not<br/>
considered a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
As far as money and allowance goes, if you&#39;d spend the money on her<br/>
anyway, why can&#39;t she have it herself?  That is what has given my kids<br/>
more freedom of choices, and at the same time allowed us to be able to<br/>
get out of a store without &quot;having&quot; to buy something.  Both my girls<br/>
have bank accounts.  We started off with giving cash, when they are/were<br/>
little, then, as they got older we started doing an automatic debit into<br/>
their account, so that saving could happen.  Our younger daughter still<br/>
gets cash, but she has an account for when that time comes.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want my kids to feel as if they need to earn the things they<br/>
want and need.  They will have the entire rest of their life to do that,<br/>
right now, they are kids and don&#39;t have to.  There are kids in the world<br/>
that have to, and it&#39;s good to remind myself of that priveledge that I<br/>
can extend to my children.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-585682750">&lt;Frankly, some of our best discussions and communication is done in the bed<br/>
late at night--all of us in the dark (somewhat) and the kids really connect<br/>
with us and with eachother in ways that maybe the light of day inhibits.<br/>
These memories, this comfort, I am sure, will be the things we all hold on<br/>
tight to throughout our lives. &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It is the same for us.  When we are all snuggled in bed we have great<br/>
conversations that I would truly miss if my kids didn&#39;t sleep in our room<br/>
and that just don&#39;t seem to happen during our busy days.  My girls are 14<br/>
and 12 and still sleep in our room nightly.  If dh is home, they are on the<br/>
floor on air mattresses.  If he is on the road (about half the time) they<br/>
take turns sharing my bed.  The dog joins one or more of us too, which we<br/>
all enjoy most of the time, though he&#39;s heavy if he lays on your legs or<br/>
your head. LOL!  <br/>
<br/>
My girls have been talking about moving to their own rooms for some time.<br/>
They are conflicted.  Lilly (12) wants to re-do her room which I&#39;ve agreed<br/>
to help with this winter and says she&#39;ll move out then.  She actually did<br/>
sleep in her own room for about a year once after we re-did it to a horse<br/>
theme.  Then she was ill for like 6 months when she was ten and she moved<br/>
back with us then and has stayed.  For some reason she will occasionally<br/>
feel like she should not be sleeping in our room.  She puts pressure on<br/>
herself to move out and be normal like her friends, but she really doesn&#39;t<br/>
want to go.  I console her by telling her two things.  If her friends&#39;<br/>
parents would let them sleep in their room, they likely would, at least some<br/>
of the time.  (one mom told me she does that when her dad is out of town and<br/>
dd loves it but her husband is against it when he is home.)  Also, I tell<br/>
her we are the only mammals who think it is normal for their young to sleep<br/>
separately from the parents.  I have told the girls that if they do end up<br/>
sleeping in their own rooms, we can still continue the tradition of hanging<br/>
out snuggling and talking for a while before we all turn in.  <br/>
<br/>
I occasionally worry that they&#39;ll never sleep in their own rooms but then I<br/>
go back to the fact that following my instincts as a mom has served me well<br/>
so far and it doesn&#39;t feel right to kick them out against their will and to<br/>
distress them when sleeping can continue to be an enjoyable thing.  (And I<br/>
enjoy it too and will miss it)  My kids are very secure in themselves most<br/>
of the time.  They were incredibly shy as young children and I never forced<br/>
them to be independent before they were ready and it has served them well.<br/>
They are as independent as they need to be.  They go to sleep-overs with<br/>
friends.  They are very responsible and honest. (They also get money monthly<br/>
that is not tied to chores and they would never think about being dishonest<br/>
with our money.)<br/>
<br/>
My mom has never slept alone unless my dad was on the road which was only<br/>
occasionally over the years.  As a child she co-slept with siblings until<br/>
she moved upstairs to help her grandmother  and she then shared a bed with<br/>
her grandmother until she married my dad.  She&#39;s about as independent as<br/>
they come.  :-)  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-645993697">I am enjoying the conversations about cosleeping with older kids! My son is<br/>
only 4 and it is comforting to know there are others out there whose older<br/>
children are still in the family bed. ;) I&#39;ve appreciated the cultural<br/>
references and studies too.<br/>
 <br/>
Our house has an odd 3-level floor plan (like a condo but it&#39;s not) with<br/>
only the master bedroom on the top level (with large closet and bathroom<br/>
suite), then on the main level where the front door is we have the living<br/>
room on one side, stairs up the middle and kitchen with dining area on the<br/>
other side (plus small bathroom by the front door), then in the daylight<br/>
basement, we have 2 more bedrooms, a full bath, and laundry room. One of the<br/>
bedrooms is the same size as our living room (big) and has a door to the<br/>
back yard so that is my office, soon to be also play room. <br/>
 <br/>
So with this layout, the 2nd bedroom is in the basement and I&#39;m not<br/>
confortable having my son 2 floors down and I doubt he would be either! So<br/>
our room is his room and he thinks nothing odd of that. Some friends have<br/>
been confused when they ask him to show them his room and he takes them up<br/>
there! <br/>
 <br/>
We do have a toddler bed in our room (at one point we tried to get him to<br/>
sleep in his own bed, it was even right next to me, but he didn&#39;t like it).<br/>
We only put him there now when he falls asleep in the car and mommy and<br/>
daddy need some adult time in bed. He&#39;ll join us during the night. <br/>
 <br/>
He has slept with Grandma before, in our house. She used to love it when her<br/>
granddaughters would sleep with her when she visited their house and has<br/>
always pressured Damon to sleep with her. It was uncomfortable the way she&#39;d<br/>
do it though, like begging and coersing him and saying we didn&#39;t need him<br/>
with us, we needed alone time. I always said to him he can sleep wherever he<br/>
wants and of course he is welcome with us. He liked to go with Grandma and<br/>
read stories but when it was time to sleep he&#39;d come back to find us.<br/>
Finally this spring he did stay the night with her! When we go on vacations<br/>
together, she is always pressuring him too, but he sleeps with us. She is<br/>
single and I think if she needs a bed buddy that badly, she should go find<br/>
her own!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1327602978">I co-slept with my step-daughter, who is now 22, until she was 14 <br/>
years old and currently co-sleeping with my 7 and 8 year old sons!  <br/>
We have two queen beds side by side.<br/>
<br/>
When I started a local chapter of attachment parenting group 7 years <br/>
ago, we had a woman from India who told us that it was very customary <br/>
in the Indian culture to co-sleep with children well into their <br/>
teenage years.  Such co-sleeping promotes more open communications <br/>
with the children as they go thru teenage transitional stage.  That <br/>
seemed SO logical to me.  I still remember the day when my daughter <br/>
did not ask to sleep with us or for us to lay down with her, I was <br/>
wondering what is going on with her?  What is she hiding from us :)?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>the bed<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; late at night--all of us in the dark (somewhat) and the kids really <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; It is the same for us. When we are all snuggled in bed we have great<br/>
&gt; conversations that I would truly miss if my kids didn&#39;t sleep in <br/>
 </span></blockquote>our room<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and that just don&#39;t seem to happen during our busy days. My girls <br/>
 </span></blockquote>are 14<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and 12 and still sleep in our room nightly. If dh is home, they are <br/>
 </span></blockquote>on the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; floor on air mattresses. If he is on the road (about half the time) <br/>
 </span></blockquote>they<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; take turns sharing my bed. The dog joins one or more of us too, <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; your head. LOL! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My girls have been talking about moving to their own rooms for some <br/>
 </span></blockquote>time.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; They are conflicted. Lilly (12) wants to re-do her room which I&#39;ve <br/>
 </span></blockquote>agreed<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to help with this winter and says she&#39;ll move out then. She <br/>
 </span></blockquote>actually did<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; sleep in her own room for about a year once after we re-did it to a <br/>
 </span></blockquote>horse<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; theme. Then she was ill for like 6 months when she was ten and she <br/>
 </span></blockquote>moved<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; back with us then and has stayed. For some reason she will <br/>
 </span></blockquote>occasionally<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; feel like she should not be sleeping in our room. She puts pressure <br/>
 </span></blockquote>on<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; herself to move out and be normal like her friends, but she really <br/>
 </span></blockquote>doesn&#39;t<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; want to go. I console her by telling her two things. If her friends&#39;<br/>
&gt; parents would let them sleep in their room, they likely would, at <br/>
 </span></blockquote>least some<br/>

 </span></blockquote>town and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; dd loves it but her husband is against it when he is home.) Also, I <br/>
 </span></blockquote>tell<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; her we are the only mammals who think it is normal for their young <br/>
 </span></blockquote>to sleep<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; separately from the parents. I have told the girls that if they do <br/>
 </span></blockquote>end up<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; sleeping in their own rooms, we can still continue the tradition of <br/>
 </span></blockquote>hanging<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; out snuggling and talking for a while before we all turn in. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I occasionally worry that they&#39;ll never sleep in their own rooms <br/>
 </span></blockquote>but then I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; go back to the fact that following my instincts as a mom has served <br/>
 </span></blockquote>me well<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; so far and it doesn&#39;t feel right to kick them out against their <br/>

 </span></blockquote>(And I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; enjoy it too and will miss it) My kids are very secure in <br/>
 </span></blockquote>themselves most<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; of the time. They were incredibly shy as young children and I never <br/>
 </span></blockquote>forced<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; them to be independent before they were ready and it has served <br/>
 </span></blockquote>them well.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; They are as independent as they need to be. They go to sleep-overs <br/>
 </span></blockquote>with<br/>

 </span></blockquote>monthly<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; My mom has never slept alone unless my dad was on the road which <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-495245895">I like to watch Korean television shows and I have noticed the adult<br/>
children in bed with their parents here and there and it&#39;s no big<br/>
deal.  These are very popular normal shows and it is just something<br/>
you see a snippet of here and there.<br/>
<br/>
In Goong the female lead snuggles in bed with her parents before going<br/>
off to get married.  Goong is the only one I can think of with a mom<br/>
and dad and it wasn&#39;t overnight.  There are a few other shows or<br/>
movies that I can&#39;t quite place where the female lead is in bed (on<br/>
adjacent mats on the floor) with her mom.  It always seems portrayed<br/>
as snuggly, nice, and sweet... not creepy and weird.   These are the<br/>
main adult characters that the story is about.  It isn&#39;t in every<br/>
show, but it definitely happens and I always think that it  it is very<br/>
sweet.<br/>

&gt; visits we typically send her weblinks that support our &#39;answers&#39;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here are two concerns she had that we need further information that<br/>

&gt; Here goesâ€¦<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; She is concerned with Tails being 11-years-old and co-sleeping. She<br/>
&gt; thinks that it is/will inhibit Tails from being independent. We have<br/>
&gt; only been able to find &#39;infant&#39; co-sleep info - is there anything<br/>
&gt; about older children and co-sleeping out there?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; She is concerned that Tails receives what we call `monthly money&#39;<br/>
&gt; (some would call it an allowance) and that we do not have required<br/>
&gt; chores in order for her to receive it. Sandra&#39;s<br/>
&gt; (http://sandradodd.com/chores) is good but it doesn&#39;t really address<br/>
&gt; what Mil considers the receipt of `free money&#39;. I also found<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sandra thank you for reminding me of this...in italy, there is a<br/>
morbid fear of &quot;mammonismo&quot; as it is not so affectionately called here<br/>
amd there has been some discussion of this on a list I am on here...<br/>
<br/>
mammonismo: meaning adult children &quot;too&quot; attached to mamma, to the<br/>
point they never leave, even if they have wellpaying jobs...and the<br/>
general feeling is &quot;poor mamma&quot; that has to keep the adult childs<br/>
clothes washed and cleaned, dinner on the table etc etc...<br/>
<br/>
I too, would love to see us living together as long as needed...right<br/>
now my two oldest daughters live part of the week with us, part of the<br/>
week in town with their &quot;nonna&quot; (grandma)...<br/>
Living with teens and older children is just so very interesting!<br/>
Im so glad to be friends with my kids.<br/>
<br/>
anyway, now you know how far behind i am! <br/>
