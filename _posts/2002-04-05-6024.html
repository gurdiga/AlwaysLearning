<div id="ygrps-yiv-1962147011">I had planned on just sending a reminder to the folks who RSVPed a month<br/>
ago, but all those addresses were on my dad&#39;s computer, which died a slow<br/>
and lingering death... <br/>
<br/>
So... this weekend is the official Spring on the Farm Party - Wecome Home<br/>
Daron and Cacie Party - Meet a Bunch of NTBSCers Party - and Just Hang<br/>
Out with Other Homeschoolers of the Unschooling Persuation Party. There<br/>
will be food a-plenty, bring a dish to share and just hang out. Possible<br/>
attractions include searching the sandbox for small animals, finding the<br/>
barn owls, watching the chickens, petting the rabbits or dogs or cats,<br/>
singing Monty Python songs, playing The Great Dalmuti and other games,<br/>
swinging on the rope swing, building a lego universe, and many more.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re located outside the town of Dunnigan, about 60 miles north of<br/>
Sacramento (or 160 miles south of Redding), right off Highway 5. It&#39;s<br/>
about an hour and 40 minutes from Oakland or just under an hour from<br/>
Sacramento (or 22 minutes from Woodland and 32 from Davis, if you drive<br/>
like I do). People tend to begin arriving around noon on Saturday and<br/>
leave easrly Sunday afternoon, but some people are coming Friday, we&#39;re<br/>
flex. Indoor sleeping space is taken, but there&#39;s plenty of room to pitch<br/>
a tent, and we&#39;ll even lend you a tent!<br/>
<br/>
Email for direction!<br/>
