<div id="ygrps-yiv-1160612837">My &quot;school-at-home&quot; friend (whom I love dearly, she is just WAY too <br/>
anal) asked, &quot;you mean she just plays all day?&quot; She was referring to <br/>
my 5 YEAR OLD! She&#39;s 5!!! &quot;I&quot; play all day! Play is what it&#39;s all <br/>
about- Who wants to grow up anyway?<br/>
We are going to try a playgroup through our local HS assoc.- wish me <br/>
luck! (this is Bob Jones curriculum land!) <br/>
Last time we tried a playgroup Eve was asked- &quot;You mean you are <br/>
allowed to read Harry Potter?! gasp!&quot; She answered yes, although I <br/>
don&#39;t think she even knows who he is (snicker)<br/>
