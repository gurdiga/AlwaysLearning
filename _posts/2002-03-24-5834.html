<div id="ygrps-yiv-1507829888">Sandra:  You just gave me a brilliant with your box stuff.... Some of the<br/>
things you mention are items I have in my house all over the place.  I have<br/>
2 London Double Decker Buses, 1 with Harrods on the side, British Telephone<br/>
Box piggy bank, tons and tons of photos of my life in England and then with<br/>
current and ex hubby (minus the ex hubby), maps, coins, Mr and Mrs Queen<br/>
stuff (I love that one), Marriage Certificate (we were married there), stuff<br/>
from Alconbury where hubby was stationed, it goes on... I think I&#39;m going to<br/>
gather them up and put them all in a box and label it and make a traditional<br/>
English dinner one day and bring the box out and talk about the items in<br/>
there....<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Sandra what a great idea.... How where did I put that flat cap eeyyy<br/>
by gum...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-560190592">What&#39;s not in there are the jigsaw puzzles.  We worked a couple a few weeks <br/>
back.  I have two more not yet touched.<br/>
<br/>
What I got were kings and queens of England puzzles, which can&#39;t be had here. <br/>
 Charity shop buys.  Both that we&#39;ve worked had all the pieces.  I have now a <br/>
beautiful photo of a gypsy wagon, and one of a painting of Elizabeth I.<br/>
<br/>
And I got some kid-blocks puzzles, twelve-cube puzzles with parts of drawings <br/>
so you have to decide which side is right for the one you&#39;re doing, and the <br/>
arrange them.  The art is kind of like the Peter Rabbit art.   We already had <br/>
two of those, one American (Disney cartoons) and one German (Snow White).  <br/>
Now we have three, and that&#39;s a collection!  So that&#39;s not in the England <br/>
suitcase. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
