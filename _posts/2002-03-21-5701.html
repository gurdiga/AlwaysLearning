<div id="ygrps-yiv-1758315684">Well, everyone wouldn&#39;t choose to homeschool, so there&#39;s no way for either<br/>
of you to prove your point. But, for fun:<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no need for anyone, kids included, to be home when you homeschool. A<br/>
political family could take their kids to the state capitol, or politics<br/>
might become web-based so that internet conference calls between elected<br/>
officials would decide law. Grocers might be young adults who have no kids,<br/>
or older adults whose kids are grown, or web-based home delivery services,<br/>
or mom and pop shops with the kids right there.<br/>
<br/>
Your friend could say, &quot;If everyone homeschooled, there&#39;d be no bookstores<br/>
because people would be home teaching kids...&quot; and I&#39;d have to tell her<br/>
she&#39;s wrong :) as we have an internet bookstore and still homeschool. We&#39;ve<br/>
toyed with opening a brick and mortar shop and we&#39;d just take the kids there<br/>
with us.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Home&quot;school is a flexible creature.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What is a gregarian society? My dictionary didn&#39;t know either, and I<br/>
can&#39;t even see it as a misspelling of a word I know ;-) Although a<br/>
gregarious society sounded okay...<br/>
<br/>
Homeschoolers (both kids and adults) can be lawmakers, politicians,<br/>
grocers, whatever, all while still being homeschoolers. I spend an<br/>
average of zero minutes a day at home teaching Cacie.<br/>
<br/>
Ditto with living on a farm. I could still live here and be a police<br/>
officer, or state senator, or something. I suppose if I were president,<br/>
I&#39;d be expected to live in the White House, but perhaps I could make some<br/>
design changes, put in an orchard or a few acres of corn... <br/>

ran their farms, bartered their goods etc and their kids did not go to<br/>
school. School as weknow it has only been around for the last hundred years<br/>
or so. the renaisaance still happened.<br/>

so there is THAT argument to start with. And the child-rearing years aren&#39;t <br/>
forever, either, by the way  - so people can take time out of other careers <br/>
to homeschool their kids. Here are a number of scenarios:<br/>
<br/>
A woman goes to college or pursues a career while in her 20&#39;s and has two <br/>
children at 30 and 32 years old. For then next 13 years she devotes all her <br/>
time to being a homeschooling mom and then, when her youngest is 13 and mom <br/>
is 43, she returns to her career on a part-time basis for the next five years <br/>
and then, at 48, she returns full time.<br/>
<br/>
Father and mother both continue to pursue full-time careers, juggling <br/>
schedules so one of them is always available to the kids. Exhausting, but <br/>
people do it.<br/>
<br/>
Father and/or mother creates a home-based business so that one or both can be <br/>
available to the kids.<br/>
<br/>
Mom has kids young - the last one by the time she is, say, 22. When her <br/>
youngest is about 13, mom is 35 and she decides to start her own business. <br/>
<br/>
Or, maybe the 35 yo mom decides to go to college and she takes her time and <br/>
graduates when she is 40, ready to launch a new career now that her youngest <br/>
child is 18.<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe, like me, mom pursues college, grad school, and full-time career and <br/>
then has her kids while in her 30&#39;s and, at that time, cuts down to a small <br/>
amount of part-time work in her field. Maybe she&#39;ll go back full-time when <br/>
her youngest is grown - or maybe she&#39;ll just stick with the part-time level <br/>
until she retires. <br/>
<br/>
Or maybe mom continues to work full-time and dad pursues part-time work in <br/>
HIS field so that he can spend considerable time with the kids.<br/>
<br/>
So - those are examples that you could use. But what I resent about this is <br/>
the implication that homeschooling/parenting is not a productive pursuit <br/>
itself. That is so sad.<br/>
<br/>
And a society that was more child-friendly would be one where it was even <br/>
EASIER to move more flexibly in and out of other kinds of productive <br/>
activities.<br/>
