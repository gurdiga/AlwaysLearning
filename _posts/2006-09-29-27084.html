<div id="ygrps-yiv-445125243">Thank you everyone for your advice.  <br/>
Sandra, I found yours most helpful.  I do not want to impose my will <br/>
on my daughter - I think if nothing else that will undermine her self-<br/>
confidence.  I want her to know that I support - and will continue to <br/>
support - her decisions.  I also think I do need to remove myself <br/>
somewhat from the school stresses.  I&#39;m sure my actions at times have <br/>
only served to emphasize that there is homework to do, when what I <br/>
really want is to provide her with the fun, peaceful home life that <br/>
she needs and we all want.  I&#39;m too quick to give her &quot;advice,&quot; when <br/>
what I really need to be doing is giving her hugs, rubbing her back, <br/>
helping her to relax, etc.<br/>
The issue really isn&#39;t the work - she has no problem with the work <br/>
being too difficult.  The anxiety/stress comes from having to do more <br/>
work when she&#39;s spent a lot of her free time in school already and <br/>
just wants to do her own thing.  She also has a strong need to please <br/>
everyone else, i.e. teachers.  <br/>
I need to let her own her decision completely and the best way to do <br/>
that is by my not investing myself in her school work.  It&#39;s her <br/>
decision to go to school, it&#39;s hers whether to do the homework, hers <br/>
whether to stay in school.  I love her and respect her no matter what <br/>
those decisions mightultimately be.<br/>
So, I&#39;m stepping back, letting her own her decision and making sure <br/>
I&#39;m not contributing to the problem.  Instead, I will just love her, <br/>
make it clear that choosing to do something else is always an option, <br/>
and be proud of the wonderful person she is.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much,<br/>
Karen</div>
