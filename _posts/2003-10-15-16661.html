I don&#39;t know if it was here or on the unschoolingdiscussion list, but <br/>
recently someone posted (and I don&#39;t remember what thread/topic it was under <br/>
either <br/>
&lt;G&gt;) about one of their children who says &quot;I know&quot; a lot. I am having that <br/>
same <br/>
experience with Moly right now. Example, she was painting and came and asked <br/>
about a brush I have that she has never used. She wanted to know if she could <br/>
use it and how to use it. I explained it similar to another she has used and <br/>
started to show her how to hold it to get the desired effect. Then came the <br/>
&quot;I <br/>
kNOw Mom.&quot; Complete with rolled eyes and a huff as she walked off.<br/>
What has worked for us is conversations about how it hurts our feelings when <br/>
J isn&#39;t nice to us. We try to be nice to him as much as possible, and it <br/>
matters that he treat us well too. We can always follow up in the heat of the <br/>
moment with just a quiet &quot;I would really like you to speak to me in a kinder way.&quot; <br/>
A lot of the time he isn&#39;t even aware of it, and it&#39;s generally followed by a <br/>
very quick apology.  You do get to be treated kindly, too. If she NEEDS to say <br/>
&quot;I KNOW!&quot; and not listen to your suggestion, then at least you don&#39;t get <br/>
dumped on. (And being kind to you includes not blaming you if the projects don&#39;t <br/>
work out.)<br/>
<br/>
As far her ignoring your suggestions -- Well...I guess that&#39;s those logical <br/>
consequences we&#39;ve all heard so much about!<br/>
<br/>
I suppose if she keeps blaming you, you could have her sign a contract that <br/>
acknowledges that she KNOWS, and that results, positive and negative are her <br/>
own responsibility. LOL<br/>
<br/>
But I would mostly stress that she has to be nice to you. It feels awaful <br/>
when our kids are mean to us.<br/>
