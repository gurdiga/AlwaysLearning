<div id="ygrps-yiv-1150184989">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
What do you guys do when you meet unschoolers who don&#39;t let their kids <br/>
watch TV? It&#39;s hard for me to be around people like this. People being <br/>
driven into controlling things out of fear, but I am around these types <br/>
of people alot. I&#39;m wondering how you guys handle this? thanks, <br/>

We planned non-TV things when their kids were over, or went to the park.<br/>
Overall, though, if they&#39;ll prohibit TV, they&#39;re prohibiting other  <br/>
things, and the parents&#39; fears kept them from trusting a family like  <br/>
ours, so it was never a problem for very long.  :-/<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  I&#39;m probably one of the only other people here that do believe it&#39;s ok to limit TV when necessary. I find my one son getting very lazy and not interested in other activities for DAYS on end if I don&#39;t say anything. If I say &quot;ok, enough TV for today&quot; and suggest that we do something, he is usually glad for it. If he&#39;s in the middle of something he really wants to watch I just say &quot;ok, when that&#39;s over do you think we could go do something?&quot; and he always is fine with that. I have relaxed a lot over the whole issue but I think there are some kids that are more addictive and affected by it than others. I just disagree with total self regulation on that topic....sorry. I do believe it is best to be relaxed over it and I&#39;m glad that self-regulation works for all of you. Ren changed her mind about this later.read about her change of heart &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

It&#39;s very generous of Ren to leave her former beliefs out there as a  <br/>
warning for people, and so they can see how and why she changed, and  <br/>
what the results were.   Ren&#39;s great.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-48067314">What about unschooling without a tv?. I have 2 daughters ages 4 and <br/>
1.TV is very boring to me and I know I prefer to provide my young <br/>
children with a naturel environment. We just don&#39;t have tv. We play <br/>
instead and sometimes we watch it if we are at someone elses house. I <br/>
do choose to limit the stay at grandpas house because he has the tv on <br/>
24/7 and will not budge from it and watches violent shows.He had a <br/>
stroke and is very brain damaged and is afraid to turn off the tv. Also <br/>
he smokes alot and the house is full of smoke and the kids don&#39;t mind <br/>
leaving at all. I play with them when we are there(which they prefer <br/>
anyway) so they are not watching about the brutal murder of some child. <br/>
I don&#39;t consider it prohibiting them from watching tv because they are <br/>
not asking to watch it. Sometimes Avalon wants to watch a movie on the <br/>
computer. I have bought her some movies but we just don&#39;t have very <br/>
many. <br/>
I believe in moving in a direction of a more naturel lifestyle. It <br/>
feels good to me and to Mother Earth. I feel like we do not watch tv <br/>
not out of fear but out of love. I do see how it would be different if <br/>
my daughters were asking. <br/>
We also have organic healthy food to choose from at our house. It has <br/>
always been that way so they love the food we eat and have never asked <br/>
for or even know what candy is. Soon enough they will be exposed and <br/>
see other kids eating it. I have had a lot of my own issues to deal <br/>
with around food. I had terrible dairy allergies as a child. I have <br/>
avoided some gatherings because of the massive junk food, but never <br/>
gatherings my daughter was asking to go to.<br/>
<br/>
Do you disagree with unschoolers providing a healthy environment for <br/>
there kids ( always researching if you are doing it out of fear or if <br/>
it is really a healthy environment) and then allowing them free rein <br/>
with in that? I am talking about younger children who are just learning <br/>
about the world. <br/>
I learned about unschooling from Naomi Aldort. I am so greatfull. And I <br/>
am always working on being less controlling. I am a very lenient mom <br/>
and I find myself really having to get creative to allow my kids <br/>
outlets for whatever it is I won&#39;t allow them to do because of safety <br/>
or major property damage. <br/>
I guess I do have fear around my children watching violent tv at a <br/>
young age. And my question is: Is there not a ballance where you could <br/>
listen to your inner vision about whether an environment is safe for <br/>
your children or not? You can always ask them ,which I do quite often, <br/>
but there are some environments I cannot explain to them. Is it all my <br/>
stuff? What about mothering instincts. Wouldn&#39;t you want to protect <br/>
your young child from say an environment such as Gandpa&#39;s house?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2021700703">These questions aren&#39;t asked to be critical, but to dissect  <br/>
statements and arguments, and to respond to questions asked.<br/>
<br/>
-=-What about unschooling without a tv?-=-<br/>
<br/>
What about unschooling without books or without puzzles?<br/>
<br/>
-=- I have 2 daughters ages 4 and 1.<br/>
TV is very boring to me...-=-<br/>
<br/>
Are those statements related?  Part of what created a good  <br/>
relationship between me and my kids was finding things we both liked  <br/>
to do together, not my keeping them away from things I found boring.   <br/>
Two things I never managed to appreciate:  playing Barbies and  <br/>
watching Pokemon.  Other than that, I did pretty well at being with  <br/>
my kids, not just physically, but mentally and emotionally, exploring  <br/>
with them what caught their interest, and learning about why they  <br/>
liked it.<br/>
<br/>
  -=-...and I know I prefer to provide my young children with a  <br/>
naturel environment-=-<br/>
<br/>
Your children aren&#39;t school-age yet, so in one way they&#39;re not  <br/>
unschooling kids.  You could still opt for school.<br/>
The only reason I say that is that there are lots of things they&#39;ll  <br/>
want to know or need to know that they can&#39;t learn in a &quot;natural  <br/>
environment.&quot;  You have a computer.  How natural is that?<br/>
<br/>
-=-I believe in moving in a direction of a more naturel lifestyle. It<br/>
feels good to me and to Mother Earth.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s common here for people to be requested not to speak for all moms  <br/>
or all unschoolers.  Maybe you shouldn&#39;t speak for Mother Earth   But  <br/>
in any case, at some point your daughters will be 14 and 11 and  <br/>
sometime before then it might be good to transition to what they want  <br/>
to do and what isn&#39;t boring to them instead of ganging up on them  <br/>
with Mother Earth.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I have had a lot of my own issues to deal with around food.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Issues seem more often to come from limitations and rules and lack of  <br/>
choices than from open communication and options.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/food">http://sandradodd.com/food</a><br/>
<br/>
-=-<br/>
Do you disagree with unschoolers providing a healthy environment for<br/>
there kids ( always researching if you are doing it out of fear or if<br/>
it is really a healthy environment)-=-<br/>
<br/>
Not at all, but where will you research whether you&#39;re doing  <br/>
something out of fear?  Or personal preference?  Or boredom?  Or  <br/>
superstition?<br/>
<br/>
If you look at the principles behind unschooling and natural  <br/>
learning, it might make less sense then to you to limit your  <br/>
children&#39;s world.  If you read about families whose unschooling has  <br/>
really taken off and lasted, I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll find many who are  <br/>
fearful.<br/>
<br/>
-=-there are some environments I cannot explain to them. Is it all my  <br/>
stuff? -=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never taken my kids to the bowling alley when I hear shouting  <br/>
that sounds like a fight in the parking lot, though it&#39;s just a  <br/>
hundred yards from our back gate.   We don&#39;t watch the news.  Every  <br/>
TV comes with a channel changing apparatus and an on-off switch (or  <br/>
if not, can be unplugged when violent news stories come).<br/>
<br/>
There are accounts of violence in books and magazines.  Will you  <br/>
prohibit all those?  There are books at the library with photos of  <br/>
mutilations and murders.  Will you not go to the library?<br/>
<br/>
-=-What about mothering instincts. Wouldn&#39;t you want to protect<br/>
your young child from say an environment such as Gandpa&#39;s house?-=--<br/>
<br/>
My kids don&#39;t have the grandpa yours do.  That&#39;s such a slanted  <br/>
question it doesn&#39;t really belong with the rest of the post, I think.<br/>
<br/>
At any point when you&#39;re making a decision to say yes or no to a  <br/>
child, if you&#39;re considering what will help the child understand the  <br/>
world better, or what will be more pleasant or intriguing or  <br/>
peaceful, then that would be cool.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe watching  Teletubbies or BoohBah would be more peaceful for a  <br/>
young child than hearing an adult complain about grandpa.<br/>

<br/>
I want to answer my own question. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In the year 2007, in the modern English speaking world, having a  <br/>
computer is as natural as having a horse was 150 years ago.<br/>
It&#39;s as natural as having a TV, in our culture, these days.  It&#39;s as  <br/>
natural as listening to recorded music.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have 2 daughters ages 4 and<br/>
&gt; 1.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They&#39;re young. But there are some pretty wonderful things that a 4  <br/>
year old would be likely to get a lot out of.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; TV is very boring to me<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Too broad a generalization (even applied only to oneself). Making  <br/>
such absolute statements is a sign of a lack of conscious decision  <br/>
making. It ignores all the complexities of what constitutes &quot;tv&quot; and  <br/>
lumps together all of what is shown on tv as if it is all the same -  <br/>
all boring. If you were at a zoo and happened to be there when lion  <br/>
cubs were playing? Why would it become boring if it is shown on tv?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and I know I prefer to provide my young<br/>
&gt; children with a naturel environment.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They can be provided with a vastly expanded environment through the  <br/>
magic of tv. You&#39;re limiting their exposure to only what they can  <br/>
experience first-hand in your own area or where you can manage to  <br/>
travel.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We just don&#39;t have tv.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, there is that flat absolute quality to what you&#39;ve said - as  <br/>
if &quot;just&quot; happens that you don&#39;t have tv.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We play<br/>
&gt; instead<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We play, too, and often our play has been enhanced by things learned  <br/>
watching tv.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and sometimes we watch it if we are at someone elses house.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It has always been annoying to my kids that other children would come  <br/>
to play, here, and want to watch tv all the time. It is VERY apparent  <br/>
that kids who live in tv-restricted homes are much more attracted to  <br/>
watching &quot;just anything that is on.&quot; My kids, with unlimited access  <br/>
to tv, were far more selective and thoughtful about their choices.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I<br/>
&gt; do choose to limit the stay at grandpas house because he has the tv on<br/>
&gt; 24/7 and will not budge from it and watches violent shows.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do the girls want to watch what he is watching? My kids would not  <br/>
have wanted to watch it - but, then, they had tv at home to whatever  <br/>
extent they wanted, so there was no reason for them to watch stuff  <br/>
they didn&#39;t much enjoy, just because it was on at the grandparents.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He had a<br/>
&gt; stroke and is very brain damaged and is afraid to turn off the tv.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You could get him a pair of wireless headphones - then only he would  <br/>
hear the sound and it wouldn&#39;t be so pervasive. Or meet them  <br/>
somewhere else, if he goes out.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also<br/>
&gt; he smokes alot and the house is full of smoke and the kids don&#39;t mind<br/>
&gt; leaving at all.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would not let my kids be in a house where a brain-damaged person  <br/>
was smoking. We had a fire in our house a year and a half ago  <br/>
(started in the clothes dryer) and I wouldn&#39;t risk my kids being in a  <br/>
place where there is fire danger. Also, one of mine has asthma - so  <br/>
we tried to stay out of smoke-filled spaces, for her sake, as well.  <br/>
But, what does that have to do with tv? Mushing these together in  <br/>
your head isn&#39;t useful for making conscious decisions.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I play with them when we are there(which they prefer<br/>
&gt; anyway) so they are not watching about the brutal murder of some  <br/>
&gt; child.<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t consider it prohibiting them from watching tv because they are<br/>
&gt; not asking to watch it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So - why bring it up? Do you think that the long-time unschooling  <br/>
families on this list who are recommending not restricting tv are, in  <br/>
fact, recommending that 1 and 4 year old children should be made to  <br/>
watch news of brutal child murders? This isn&#39;t clear thinking.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Sometimes Avalon wants to watch a movie on the<br/>
&gt; computer. I have bought her some movies but we just don&#39;t have very<br/>
&gt; many.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;Just don&#39;t?&quot; (You choose not to - using the word &quot;just&quot; over and  <br/>
over makes it sound inevitable or like it &quot;just&quot; happens.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I believe in moving in a direction of a more naturel lifestyle.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you want your kids to really appreciate &quot;Mother Earth,&quot; then watch  <br/>
National Geographic specials and PBS &quot;Nature&quot; and   Nova and  <br/>
Scientific American Frontiers. You&#39;re missing out on exposure of the  <br/>
grandeur and diversity of Mother Earth, otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It<br/>
&gt; feels good to me and to Mother Earth.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Huh?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I feel like we do not watch tv<br/>
&gt; not out of fear but out of love.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sounds like it is out of limited thinking, to me. It is looking at  <br/>
the worst stuff on tv and thinking that is all there is to it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I do see how it would be different if<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It has<br/>
&gt; always been that way so they love the food we eat and have never asked<br/>
&gt; for or even know what candy is.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not saying kids need candy, I&#39;m pretty sure mine had never had soda,  <br/>
for example, when they were your kids&#39; ages, but it seems the  <br/>
environment would have to be pretty darn restricted to prevent a 4 yo  <br/>
from even knowing what candy is. No playing at other people&#39;s houses?  <br/>
No homeschool park days? No pinatas? No reading books in which kids  <br/>
have candy?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Soon enough they will be exposed and<br/>
&gt; see other kids eating it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And adults.<br/>

&gt; avoided some gatherings because of the massive junk food, but never<br/>
&gt; gatherings my daughter was asking to go to.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Waiting for kids to ask for things is not a useful unschooling  <br/>
policy, in general. It is an unschooling parent&#39;s role to offer and  <br/>
extend and expand a child&#39;s experience, not to restrict it and hope  <br/>
the child won&#39;t ask for as long as possible. Again, I&#39;m not saying  <br/>
you have to give your kids candy, just saying that there is an  <br/>
attitude of restriction that comes across clearly in your post as  <br/>
being out of fear, in spite of your disclaimer.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Do you disagree with unschoolers providing a healthy environment for<br/>
&gt; there kids ( always researching if you are doing it out of fear or if<br/>
&gt; it is really a healthy environment) and then allowing them free rein<br/>
&gt; with in that?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think I provided an extraordinary environment for my kids (now 16,  <br/>
19, and 22). Mine had no tv restrictions and no specific food  <br/>
restrictions. We &quot;protected&quot; them in a different way than you are  <br/>
talking about, though. We didn&#39;t watch violent gruesome tv or movies  <br/>
when they were around. We watched stuff we thought they&#39;d enjoy, too.  <br/>
We watched a LOT of nature shows, because they liked them and so did  <br/>
we. We watched Sesame Street and Mr. Rogers and I cannot for the life  <br/>
of me imagine preventing children from watching Reading Rainbow - my  <br/>
kids absolutely loved it. They made their own versions - used our  <br/>
video recorder and did book reviews like Reading Rainbow has.<br/>
<br/>
These days - my oldest daughter just called - she&#39;s in Alaska and  <br/>
will be working as a back-country ranger in the wilds of the Alaskan  <br/>
wilderness. Nobody could &quot;love Mother Earth&quot; more. I don&#39;t see that  <br/>
tv-watching did anything but enhance that love.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am talking about younger children who are just learning<br/>
&gt; about the world.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not learning as much about the world as they could if they were  <br/>
seeing more of it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I learned about unschooling from Naomi Aldort. I am so greatfull.  <br/>

&gt; or major property damage.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I guess I do have fear around my children watching violent tv at a<br/>
&gt; young age.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So - can you not envision that they might not want to watch violent  <br/>
tv? Why would they want to watch it?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And my question is: Is there not a ballance where you could<br/>
&gt; listen to your inner vision about whether an environment is safe for<br/>
&gt; your children or not?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Too much black or white thinking. It isn&#39;t a choice of &quot;gruesome/ <br/>
violent tv&quot; versus &quot;no tv.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You can always ask them ,which I do quite often,<br/>
&gt; but there are some environments I cannot explain to them. Is it all my<br/>
&gt; stuff? What about mothering instincts. Wouldn&#39;t you want to protect<br/>
&gt; your young child from say an environment such as Gandpa&#39;s house?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your thinking will be more clear if you don&#39;t mentally mix up tv- <br/>
watching at home with what goes on at grandpa&#39;s house and with eating  <br/>
candy and so on. Too many different situations all being considered  <br/>
as one and the same - think realistically about your own house. Would  <br/>
&quot;you&quot; be watching violent shows when your kids were around? You&#39;d be  <br/>
cuddled up together watching something sweet and wonderful, I&#39;m sure!<br/>
<br/>
Are you also saying, &quot;We just have no music at our house,&quot; because  <br/>
somebody else listens to music with violent lyrics?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We just have no magazines here,&quot; because there are porn magazines?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We just have no books,&quot; because there are graphically violent books  <br/>
in the world?&quot;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; What about unschooling without a tv?.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Keep in mind that your options are more varied than no-tv-at-all and <br/>
900 channels of everything all the time. Your 4yo is already <br/>
watching some movies on the computer. At some point you might <br/>
consider getting a separate tv with a dvd player, or maybe just a <br/>
portable dvd player, to expand the options a little. That way one <br/>
kid could play a computer game while the other watches a movie, or <br/>
they could watch separate movies, or they could watch a kid-movie <br/>
while mom and dad snuggle up with something they would find dull. <br/>
You could subscribe to a dvd service so your kids could watch some <br/>
kids shows that way. Its about options.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; sometimes we watch it if we are at someone elses house.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Its a good idea to see how they are relating to tv at others&#39; homes <br/>
to get an idea if broadcast or cable tv is something you should be <br/>
offerring. Kids don&#39;t always come right out and ask - especially if <br/>
its something they know mom is uncomfortable about. I could see my <br/>
dd was easily frustrated by broadcast tv at others&#39; homes, so I <br/>
didn&#39;t offer. We live on a pretty tight budget, and there&#39;s no free <br/>
tv where I live. I suspected at some point her interest level would <br/>
exceed her frustration level, though.  <br/>
<br/>
My stepson moving in changed the issues somewhat - he *wanted* <br/>
satellite, so we got it. He had only had basic broadcast at his <br/>
mom&#39;s house, and &quot;knew&quot; not to ask for more than that, so I <br/>
suggested the satellite option to him - he jumped up and down and <br/>
hooted with joy.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I believe in moving in a direction of a more naturel lifestyle. It <br/>
&gt; feels good to me and to Mother Earth.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I live in the woods, in a cabin I built myself, with spring <br/>
water, a wood-stove and a composting toilet. In the past I&#39;ve lived <br/>
with no electricity or running water, and if you take a walk with me <br/>
in the woods, get ready to hear &quot;hey, you can eat that!&quot; a gazillion <br/>
times. So I do understand about wanting to live close to nature. <br/>
Having a tv - even having a satellite dish - doesn&#39;t necessarily <br/>
hamper that.<br/>
<br/>
This morning, for example, my 5yo got up, watched one tv program and <br/>
then went outside to climb trees. Right now, she and her dad are out <br/>
working on a simple treehouse that she designed. Pretty picturesque. <br/>
She *could* be inside watching tv but is choosing not to. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I guess I do have fear around my children watching violent tv at a <br/>
&gt; young age. And my question is: Is there not a ballance where you <br/>
 </span></blockquote>could <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; listen to your inner vision about whether an environment is safe <br/>
 </span></blockquote>for <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; your children or not?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Rather than listening to your &quot;inner vision&quot; listen to and watch <br/>
your kids. Its possible to empower kids to make their own decisions <br/>
about what&#39;s &quot;too much&quot; for them, personally. My 5yo doesn&#39;t like <br/>
dramatic tension in live-action shows and movies *at all*. I know <br/>
this from watching with her and being really responsive to her <br/>
statements, sounds and body language. I don&#39;t expect her to watch <br/>
something that makes her uncomfortable. I&#39;ve helped her find ways to <br/>
turn things off either on her own or asking someone else, or look <br/>
for other solutions. <br/>
<br/>
Last summer she decided she Really wanted to watch one of the Harry <br/>
Potter movies - she fell in love with a magical creature she saw on <br/>
the cover of the movie case. We borrowed a friend&#39;s copy but she <br/>
couldn&#39;t stand to watch more than a few minutes of it. She didn&#39;t <br/>
want to give it up, though. She devised a plan for watching it - she <br/>
watched the extras, then watched it scene by scene in different <br/>
languages. Finally she was able to watch the whole thing, beginning <br/>
to end, in English. It was a pretty amazing process, and one that <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have happened if her dad or I had made the decision &quot;too <br/>
scary&quot; for her. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Wouldn&#39;t you want to protect <br/>
&gt; your young child from say an environment such as Gandpa&#39;s house?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This goes right along with empowering them to make decisions about <br/>
what to watch. Do your kids *want* to visit their grandpa? How long <br/>
do they want to stay? Do you tell them &quot;we&#39;re going&quot; or ask? If they <br/>
aren&#39;t interested in being there, don&#39;t take them. If they want to <br/>
see him, but not in his home, make arrangements to meet him <br/>
elsewhere. Chuck E Cheese is a nice, busy environment that he might <br/>
find very stimulating.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1653347522">I used to have my fears about the tv. There were so may &quot;experts&quot; <br/>
that said tv does more harm that good. And I used to be very <br/>
limiting on how much tv I let the kids watch. <br/>
But my son loves to watch tv and I let go of all the limits. He <br/>
really enjoys it and I enjoy watching it with him. I wished there <br/>
were shows on like that on when I was a kid. Jimmy Nuetron, Avatar, <br/>
Sponge Bob, and my all time fav-Pucca. They all rock and we have so <br/>
much fun watching them together. <br/>
I can understand where the other family is coming from with their <br/>
fears b/c I was there once. Even though I dont know them I assume <br/>
they are trying to do whats best for their children. Sometimes <br/>
people make these kind of decisions not b/c they are mean control <br/>
freak parents but out of fear and ignorance on the subject. <br/>
Do you think your freedom with tv and the good experiences you have <br/>
can show them that it is a good?<br/>
Being exosed to other peoples experiences and remembering my own <br/>
childhood really helped me let go of that issue.<br/>
Usually when my kids are visiting over someone else house they are <br/>
too busy exploring all the new toys and surroundings and dont really <br/>
care if the tv is on or not. But mine are all younger. I dont know <br/>
if it is different with older children. And when we have people over <br/>
and they dont want thier children watching a certain show or tv in <br/>
general and my children are watching something I will put it on our <br/>
room and let them watch it in there-which they dont mind. I have <br/>
never had anyone comment on our freedom with the tv yet so I dont <br/>
really know how I would handle that. Probably with an answer <br/>
like &quot;they learn alot from the tv&quot; and &quot;We love to watch it together <br/>
and talk about the things we seen&quot;.<br/>
But when I was a child-I was left alone at home with my siblings all <br/>
the time after school and in the summer. No one was there to control <br/>
us while our parents were at work and we watched whatever we wanted. <br/>
And I can say that it didnt affect me in a negetive way at all. In <br/>
fact it revealed to me many opportunities and ideas and exposed <br/>
differences in people and situations. I loved MTV and watched it as <br/>
much as I could. Do any of you remember Liquid Television? That <br/>
played a huge roll in shaping my artistic abilities. <br/>
And we never watched any thing like taxas chainsaw massacre. I think <br/>
the most violent show we watched was Power Rangers ^-^.Well. Im not <br/>
trying to drag this out. We havent been doing this very long but <br/>
this has been our experience so far and all the changes we have made <br/>
have had positive effects.I hope it was helpful.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-195031838">I have been thinking about this a lot lately because we have recently<br/>
moved into a house that has cable TV and came partially furnished with<br/>
2 TV sets. At the same time that we moved we were given another TV set<br/>
and in the past 6 months we bought a gaming system that required<br/>
buying a TV to play on. Suddenly we have 4 TVs and lots of channels.<br/>
Before all of this we had only computers and a portable DVD player to<br/>
watch movies on (unrestricted). My kids (ages 4,7,&10) had not asked<br/>
for TV but I was in no hurry to get one either because where we live<br/>
you must pay for a service to get any reception. I knew we would have<br/>
TV eventually so I had really been trying to work through all of my<br/>
issues. I grew up with severe TV restrictions and very blatant<br/>
negative judgements regarding programming so that even when I was<br/>
allowed to watch I felt guilty for enjoying things like &quot;Love Boat&quot;<br/>
and &quot;Three&#39;s Company&quot; and  &quot;General Hospital&quot; because I knew they were<br/>
&quot;crap&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
When the kids were younger I really liked that we had no TV, but it<br/>
was very true that every time the grandparents visited and stayed at<br/>
the resorts it was difficult to get them away from the TV to do other<br/>
things. Same when we would visit my parents on the mainland or friends<br/>
where they would watch. There was a part of me that feared that they<br/>
would be the same way at home. Well, guess what? I was right!!;) We<br/>
have had the TVs and cable for (only)1 month  and they watch A LOT of<br/>
TV. Unless they have friends over (none of their friends are limited<br/>
in their watching so they don&#39;t want to watch when they are here:)<br/>
they are most likely to be watching TV. And the shows they want to<br/>
watch the most? GAME SHOWS!! Did you know that there is a game show<br/>
network (GSN) that plays gameshows 24/7?!<br/>
<br/>
My oldest 2 spend quite a bit of time with their friends and our house<br/>
has always been the &quot;fun&quot; house where they can try crazy experiments<br/>
and create giant messes and jump on the trampoline and go prawning in<br/>
the ditch and help themselves to whatever they are hungry for.  We got<br/>
the gaming system because we knew it would be great fun and our son<br/>
was wanting to spend time at other kid&#39;s houses because they had video<br/>
games. I want our house to be an equally attractive option. This<br/>
summer we are setting up an above the ground pool and a batting cage<br/>
partially with that in mind. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that they will always want to watch game shows for most<br/>
of the day and I am grateful to lists like this one that have helped<br/>
me examine my fears and controls of TV and food (and  to see them for<br/>
what they really were - fears) because to be honest, I am having a<br/>
blast watching game shows too- something I would not have allowed<br/>
myself a couple of years ago! The 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s hairdos and clothes<br/>
crack us up - my kids can&#39;t believe that I used to dress like that!<br/>
And the connections that happen every day because of this new exposure<br/>
is so fun!<br/>
<br/>
My 10 yr old DS has just blossomed with self confidence and exudes<br/>
this calm inner sense of himself lately that completely coincides with<br/>
his acceptance of the trust that I have shown in him as a result of my<br/>
own unschooling wrt TV.<br/>
<br/>
One last note on this. My DH just finished reading a novel where one<br/>
of the characters comes to the US from the Marshall Islands (very 3rd<br/>
world) and is obsessed with watching &quot;The Price is Right&quot;. It is how<br/>
she learns to speak English. We had a good laugh about the<br/>
similarities between this character and our own children. It is as if<br/>
they are learning a new language having been cut off from a huge part<br/>
of our culture for a long time. The result is that they are even more<br/>
interesting people now and they get even more jokes and they can<br/>
participate more fully in conversations with this new cultural<br/>
knowledge. I am now having a difficult time remembering what it was<br/>
that I feared - except maybe that they would watch game shows all day<br/>
long ;) - Alyse</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391548312">Hiya<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m puzzled. Why does this TV issue keep coming up? Am I just not getting<br/>
something here? <br/>
<br/>
By choice, we (hubby, me and all 5 kids ages 5,10,12,15 and 17 - although to<br/>
be absolutely honest I guess the 5 year old has not had too much say about<br/>
it) don&#39;t have a TV and it has not been an issue for any of us, although we<br/>
do discuss the option of getting one from time to time. We don&#39;t miss having<br/>
one and we honestly don&#39;t feel we have the time for one; our lives are so<br/>
busy. We do have a digital projector, and we enjoy watching DVD&#39;s,<br/>
especially on those early winter nights.<br/>
<br/>
From the recent posts on the matter, it seems that unschoolers feel that a<br/>
TV is an essential item for successful unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
We have horses, and we would argue that unschoolers (actually all people)<br/>
need horses. But most people don&#39;t have horses and don&#39;t particularly care<br/>
that they don&#39;t either. And I don&#39;t read mails on the list about how kids<br/>
are missing out because they don&#39;t have horses, but when someone doesn&#39;t<br/>
have a TV, it seems that they are missing out - and people are quite quick<br/>
to say so.<br/>
<br/>
Please explain.<br/>
<br/>
Regards<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-997116365">-=-When we were at that phase, I reassured my husband by taking the kids<br/>
to one of those teacher stores and letting them pick out what they<br/>
wanted. It saved $ and he thought it was good cause it was the same<br/>
stuff the teachers buy. It ended up to work out ok, I&#39;m not saying<br/>
thats true unschooling, I&#39;m saying it was a bridge to unschooling. -=-<br/>
<br/>
There was a teachers&#39; supply store in Albuquerque that we LOVED  <br/>
called Colburn&#39;s, and we&#39;d get games and counters and fancy pencils  <br/>
posters and paints and individual crayons and Dover books and other  <br/>
coloring books.  But it closed.  When it was open we used to go in  <br/>
just to look at things, like the globes of the moon, and the charts  <br/>
teachers used to track kids and &quot;reward&quot; them with stars and stuff.<br/>

<br/>
Are you not getting that the same topics will come up, always,  <br/>
because there are always new unschoolers?  We&#39;ve had 20 people join  <br/>
the list since the beginning of June.<br/>
<br/>
The first time someone&#39;s in a discussion she might just ignore it  <br/>
because she believes what she believes.<br/>
As she gets more experience with unschooling and some things aren&#39;t  <br/>
working, she&#39;ll be looking to discard and rearrange some beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
Once things start to work well and the changes come, some people  <br/>
stick around to help others.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the pattern.<br/>

<br/>
Someone made a similar argument a while back (maybe on  <br/>
UnschoolingDiscussion, maybe here) about a backhoe.<br/>
I have three guitars, a piano, three electric keyboards, a reed organ  <br/>
and a dozen recorders in five different voices, but I don&#39;t expect  <br/>
others to have all those instruments.  I wouldn&#39;t do well without at  <br/>
least one recorder and a guitar, but others do fine.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1650865777">I&#39;d love to have a couple of horses, but they cost too much and take  <br/>
up a whole lot of obligatory time, every day. M;y daughter rode  <br/>
horses through her 4H club, which had 26 horses, for four years and I  <br/>
know, first-hand, how much work it is and how much it costs.<br/>
<br/>
So we, rather reluctantly, have decided we can&#39;t afford horses these  <br/>
days.<br/>
<br/>
A tv does NOT require stabling and doesn&#39;t require twice a day  <br/>
feeding and doesn&#39;t get lonely and weird when it isn&#39;t watched  <br/>
regularly and it doesn&#39;t need to be washed and cleaned and, oh yeah,  <br/>
no mucking out its stall &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
A tv sits in the corner minding its own business, coming to life only  <br/>
when we choose to click the remote!<br/>
<br/>
As wonderful as a horse is, and I love them, it doesn&#39;t open up the  <br/>
kinds of worlds that a tv does.<br/>
<br/>
Can a family happily unschool without a tv? Of course. It isn&#39;t some  <br/>
kind of essential tool.<br/>
<br/>
But if a family is restricting tv because they are fearful of what  <br/>
the kids will learn by watching it - that attitude is  <br/>
counterproductive to unschooling. It is the fear and lack of trust in  <br/>
the children and that parents are making an arbitrary choice to  <br/>
restrict something that could be wonderful, could open all kinds of  <br/>
learning opportunities to the kids, that is the problem, not the lack  <br/>
of tv.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-432436173">Thank you for your response. It was gentle and kind and easier for me <br/>
to hear. <br/>
The girls do not ask to go to see Grandpa anymore. He was mean to <br/>
Avalon last time we went. We used to try to meet him at a restaruant. <br/>
He does get very angry and hard to deal with. It makes him very angry <br/>
when I go to hold Avalon when she is crying and asking to be held. I <br/>
have given up on having a relationship with him. He cannot speak and <br/>
cannot understand very much. He has less and less time of clearity. <br/>
It is sad because he used to be a really fun person. He would have <br/>
loved to play with the girls before the stroke. When I saked Avalon <br/>
if she wanted to see him she used to say yes but now she doesn&#39;t. She <br/>
would sit in front of the tv some at his house and I have seen her <br/>
begging her father to come play. I ask her if she wants to play and <br/>
she says yes and I am trying to distract her away from the tv news. I <br/>
thought that was a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up going to a Free school and with out electricity in the deep <br/>
woods with a composting toilet. I don&#39;t feel like I was deprived <br/>
without a tv.  As I got older I sure wanted a telephone.<br/>
<br/>
My passsion in life is to expand my awareness. That is why I am open <br/>
enough to hear about the radical unschooling ideas around tv. I am <br/>
not ready to go out and buy tv yet.<br/>
<br/>
I have more questions:<br/>
What about the warning by even mainstreem pediatrics that there <br/>
should be no tv for children under the age of two because it will <br/>
inhibit their developement? Why wouldn&#39;t you be concerned about that?<br/>
<br/>
If you have ever read Naomi Aldort or listened to her CD&#39;s you know <br/>
that she highly recommends unschooling and yet she says no tv until <br/>
age 9. <br/>
I have taken many classes from Tom Brown at his willderness Awareness <br/>
school. A man named John Young who was his student for 10years taught <br/>
a class on Cayote teaching(basically unschooling by answering a <br/>
childs questions with another question) He showed us that tv and more <br/>
so video games limit the mind to the point where they did studies on <br/>
kids that played alot of video games and were only using 5% of there <br/>
brains. How exactly they test that I am not sure except that I know <br/>
that some kids lost the ability to see in three D and an Art teacher <br/>
had to take them out side and show them that this tree was actually <br/>
farther away then that tree. <br/>
For me watching tv puts me in tunnel vision and takes me away from <br/>
hearing my inner voices (messages from my spirit guides)Not that I <br/>
can always hear them and I will agree that there are some very good <br/>
shows on tv.<br/>
What about the power of subliminal over the tv. Is it really allowing <br/>
for a young child to choose for themself when they are bombarded with <br/>
commertials that push hard for kids to get addicted to say soda etc? <br/>
Is that really freedom of choice for them?. Those advertising <br/>
companies study extensively how to brainwash kids into wanting there <br/>
stuff and the government does not protect the people from very toxic <br/>
ingredients in some so called food that is directly targeted towards <br/>
children.(Aspertame, propalene glysol etc.)<br/>
What about these issues? Do you think that if you are able to <br/>
completely let go of these fears even subconsiously that none of <br/>
these will effect you or your children? I believe that could be true <br/>
but I am not sure how to do that?<br/>
These are all the deepest darkest fears I have about tv. I have never <br/>
heard anything that challenged thier validity until now.<br/>
<br/>
Now I am all about letting go of fear and expanding my awareness.. <br/>
First you have to be aware of the fear. I did not see myself as <br/>
fearing tv for my children before, but now I see where the fear has <br/>
been instilled in me. I did not miss tv as a child tho. My dad would <br/>
read us esp stories around the table after dinner.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for your honest input<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1844330435">Hi <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Are you not getting that the same topics will come up, always, because<br/>
there are always new unschoolers?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Yes, I do understand that. It is the strong and united sense that comes<br/>
through from veteran unschoolers that TV is indispensable that I am puzzling<br/>
over. I &#39;think&#39; that we are unschooling successfully without it. And I am<br/>
questioning the idea that any one thing is indispensable to unschool - I<br/>
feel that it is what I understand, not what I have that makes the<br/>
difference. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I agree that if I don&#39;t have a TV and deny my children access to one because<br/>
of fear, this is a problem. I think the same could be said of my earlier<br/>
example of horses. I come across a lot of people who are scared of horses<br/>
and of what could happen around them and who therefore don&#39;t let their<br/>
children have access to them. The more I look at it, I realize that fear is<br/>
the opposite of freedom, and thus we are forced to confront those fears if<br/>
we want to unschool - which is an incredible expression of freedom.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I believe (I&#39;m hopelessly biased) that horses are wonderful for people in<br/>
general, and especially for children, and most especially for teenage girls,<br/>
and I could write pages about the benefits and advantages and about what<br/>
horses have done for me etc etc, but it doesn&#39;t change it from being a<br/>
benefit that not all will enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I have three guitars, a piano, three electric keyboards, a reed organ and a<br/>
dozen recorders in five different voices, but I don&#39;t expect others to have<br/>
all those instruments. I wouldn&#39;t do well without at least one recorder and<br/>
a guitar, but others do fine.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I agree. I still don&#39;t see why TV should be in a special category. To me it<br/>
is in the same category as the things you mention, or horses, or whatever<br/>
interests anyone. <br/>
<br/>
If it is important to have a TV in the house, available for people to use if<br/>
they choose, then why is it not equally important to have a reed organ (or a<br/>
horse) available for the same reason? <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
From the house full of smoke, yes, especially since you imply that Grandpa <br/>
is not willing or able to take his cigarette outside while you visit. This <br/>
is not something that Jayn could choose to ignore or ask for a different <br/>
channel over. That is enough of a deal breaker.<br/>
<br/>
From the tv, no, since Jayn is perfectly able to protect herself from any <br/>
images/sounds she finds scary - and has done so since being able to cry or <br/>
crawl or move or turn her head away or go to sleep. All of these were cues <br/>
that I noticed and acted on.<br/>
<br/>
However Jayn would probably ask for her own channels, and if Grandpa were <br/>
unable to change the channel - well it just doesn&#39;t sound like much of a <br/>
visit somehow. It also sounds like Grandpa may not be emotionally up to <br/>
visits with his grandkids after his stroke if he needs to focus on the tv <br/>
during his waking hours.<br/>
<br/>
I can certainly say that at 1 or 4 Jayn had zero interest in violent or <br/>
adult themed television or movies - her favorites were Max and Ruby and Bob <br/>
the Builder, later the Disney channel. At the moment at 7.5 she has become <br/>
very interested in the Discovery Kids programming, craft shows and the Food <br/>
Network cooking shows.<br/>
<br/>
I have responded to what might be called &quot;content concerns&quot; in the past and <br/>
Sandra kindly kept it here:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/t/whatif#robyn">http://sandradodd.com/t/whatif#robyn</a><br/>
<br/>
along with some other people&#39;s experiences with tv and their kids.<br/>
<br/>
I guess this is partly one of those situations where there isn&#39;t any need to <br/>
fix what isn&#39;t broken. You don&#39;t have a tv, but you do have the capacity to <br/>
provide dvd&#39;s on the computer. Jayn preferred to watch a narrow range of <br/>
programming including movies over and over again, so dvd&#39;s were a perfect <br/>
solution for us then.<br/>
<br/>
My only concern is that the kids sensing a generalized disapproval about the <br/>
tv as being not &quot;natural&quot; or against their parent&#39;s philosophies in <br/>
principle, in the fullness of time may not feel free to ask for their own <br/>
tv. The problem occurs if they then feel the need to sneak it as a forbidden <br/>
fruit, or seek it outside of the home. It could become a big barrier between <br/>
parent and child because of the disapproval.<br/>
<br/>
Our kids need to be able to come to us with the really hard questions, and <br/>
process the hard emotions in our supportive presence. Our tv watching has <br/>
repeatedly been the catalyst for many wonderful discussions, and it is the <br/>
content that might be seen as objectionable that has been the most useful.<br/>
<br/>
TV provides me a wonderful conucopia, especially with all the specialist <br/>
cable channels. Jayn and I are currently developing a series proposal about <br/>
doll crafting.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s essential for unschooling is helping children explore what  <br/>
interests them, free from parents&#39; personal opinions on its worth.<br/>
<br/>
Some people love ice cream. Some can take it or leave it.<br/>
<br/>
The issue isn&#39;t whether or not a home has ice cream. The issue is how  <br/>
free the children feel to have ice cream if they like it. Children  <br/>
whose parents think ice cream is the path to obesity can&#39;t choose as  <br/>
freely as children whose parents can take ice cream or leave it.<br/>
<br/>
Whether or not a family has TV, isn&#39;t the point. The point is *why* a  <br/>
family doesn&#39;t have a TV.<br/>
<br/>
And why a particular family is making a choice is difficult to  <br/>
discuss on a board. (And totally irrelevant on a board oriented  <br/>
towards discussing philosophy. The focus is on idea not on the  <br/>
practices of individual families.) Parents can easily say the family  <br/>
can get a TV anytime they want, setting that up as a general idea for  <br/>
other families. But parents can also be self delusional. If they  <br/>
personally don&#39;t care for TV, they can be willfully blind to the  <br/>
influence they&#39;re having on the kids. Kids can say they don&#39;t want  <br/>
it, but they may not feel as free to say they do want it as parents  <br/>
think.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s happening in your family. I&#39;m saying that&#39;s the  <br/>
situation that can be behind anyone who wants to present the idea of  <br/>
a family choosing not to have a TV. We can&#39;t know if the parents are  <br/>
truly thoughtful and aware and sensitive to their kids. We can&#39;t know  <br/>
if that idea is going out to parents who think they&#39;re thoughtful but  <br/>
are really relieved they&#39;re able to get the family to agree to what  <br/>
the parents want.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s much more helpful to discuss the philosophy of helping children  <br/>
find ways to explore their interests. What that looks like in a  <br/>
particular family -- and it might be the children are completely  <br/>
disinterested in TV so it&#39;s never on -- will be different from family  <br/>
to family.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If it is important to have a TV in the house, available for people  <br/>

&gt; they choose, then why is it not equally important to have a reed  <br/>
&gt; organ (or a<br/>
&gt; horse) available for the same reason?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What children have access to through TV is a lot broader than a reed  <br/>
organ. A TV is more akin to a library than a horse. There are stories  <br/>
ranging from Akira to CSI to Hamlet. There are instructional shows  <br/>
like cooking and yoga. There are informational shows on volcanos and  <br/>
cheetas and The Battle of Thermopylae. There&#39;s as much to watch on TV  <br/>
as there is to explore in a library.<br/>
<br/>
Saying &quot;We don&#39;t have a reed organ&quot; is worlds away from saying &quot;We  <br/>
don&#39;t have access to books.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s more helpful in terms of unschooling to have a TV that  <br/>
no one chooses to watch than to not have a TV at all.<br/>
<br/>
Even that&#39;s a bit iffy in terms of freedom. Having books in the house  <br/>
and never reading them to kids doesn&#39;t give them the same freedom as  <br/>
parents who occasionally attempt to read to their kids who&#39;ve shown  <br/>
they&#39;re not (yet) interested. There&#39;s a huge barrier for kids who are  <br/>
curious about TV in a home that doesn&#39;t have one. It&#39;s like saying  <br/>
we&#39;ll build doors to the outside world if kids ever ask for them.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t a requirement that a home have TV. It&#39;s helpful if parents  <br/>
are fully aware of the barriers they may be putting between their  <br/>
children and their interests. *Any* interests, whether it be horses  <br/>
or reed organs. And though I almost included TV in that list, TV  <br/>
isn&#39;t really an interest. It&#39;s a portal to things children might be  <br/>
interested in. People aren&#39;t interested in TV so much as they&#39;re  <br/>
interested in programs they can access through TV.<br/>

Had you  had TV and phone as a 20th century child, your awareness  <br/>

<br/>
That was probably a good thing, to give her a better option than  <br/>
watching the news.<br/>
If she had free access to TV at home, she probably would NOT have  <br/>
been watching news (one of the least interesting things to kids) at  <br/>
all, anywhere, but would&#39;ve been choosing (being used to choice) to  <br/>
do a better thing.<br/>
<br/>
When children can choose to do a better thing, they do, but children  <br/>
WANT to learn (unless and until that spark of curiosity is snuffed  <br/>
out with pressure or shame or ragging about them not learning well  <br/>
and right, as school so often does, as parents can replicate at home  <br/>
if they&#39;re not careful).  When a child wants to learn, and TV is new  <br/>
and unfamiliar, she WILL watch whatever&#39;s on, to find out what&#39;s so  <br/>
dangerous and bad about the thing that&#39;s been forbidden in her life.   <br/>
What is so powerful that her mother&#39;s afraid of it or scorns it?<br/>
<br/>
Parents who prevent TV send the message that the TV is stronger than  <br/>
the child.  Someone else made that point here a while back, and I  <br/>

I have a link to that recommendation, and some commentary.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking you haven&#39;t gone and looked at the TV links, but are  <br/>
just responding to e-mails.<br/>
One way to expand awareness and to understand where longtime  <br/>
unschoolers are coming from is to read those collections of the good  <br/>
parts of prior discussions.<br/>
<br/>
-=-For me watching tv puts me in tunnel vision and takes me away from<br/>
hearing my inner voices (messages from my spirit guides)Not that I<br/>
can always hear them and I will agree that there are some very good<br/>
shows on tv.-=-<br/>
<br/>
There are some good shows and some bad shows.<br/>
There are some good voices in people&#39;s heads and some bad voices.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re quoting and citing people and their studies and their fears  <br/>
(Naomi Aldort, Tom Brown, John Young, &quot;mainstream pediatrics&quot;) but it  <br/>
seems you&#39;re listening to them without wondering why they&#39;re saying  <br/>
what they&#39;re saying, but just accepting it.<br/>
<br/>
Critical thinking, analytical thinking, mindful thinking is all very  <br/>
important for learning to make your own choices.  If you choose to  <br/>
follow someone else&#39;s advice, it should be because you really looked  <br/>
at it from many angles, compared it to all the advice you had already  <br/>
heard, formed an internal grid of comparisons and relative merit and  <br/>
value and then turned the decision into your own decision.<br/>
<br/>
A man in an online unschooling chat once challenged me with &quot;Are you  <br/>
willing to risk your child&#39;s future on your &#39;theories&#39;?&quot; and I shot  <br/>
back immediately, &quot;Yes, aren&#39;t you?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If my &quot;theory&quot; (my beliefs and convictions, really, as I had been  <br/>
unschooling for some years then and didn&#39;t consider it a flimsy  <br/>
&quot;theory&quot;) was that choice helps kids learn to think well and to live  <br/>
responsibly, I was absolutely willing to live my life that way.  And  <br/>
if his theory was that going along with the vague mainstream  <br/>
recommendations perceived out of the corner of his eye or read in  <br/>
Newsweek or heard on the news was the way to avoid &quot;risking his  <br/>
child&#39;s future,&quot; then he was willing to risk his child&#39;s future on that.<br/>
<br/>
-=-A man named John Young who was his student for 10years taught<br/>
a class on Cayote teaching(basically unschooling by answering a<br/>
childs questions with another question) -=-<br/>
<br/>
Answering questions with questions is called &quot;Socratic method,&quot;  <br/>
usually.  It&#39;s been a mainstay of the way Jewish children are dealt  <br/>
with for ----started to say &quot;a long time,&quot; but I figure the answer is  <br/>
&quot;thousands of years.&quot;  It&#39;s not &quot;coyote teaching.&quot;  It&#39;s drawing out  <br/>
thought and conversation.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s what happens on this list.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not &quot;unschooling,&quot; though, it&#39;s helping someone discover  <br/>
answers, or bringing their questions into clearer forms.<br/>
<br/>
-=-He showed us that tv and more<br/>
so video games limit the mind to the point where they did studies on<br/>
kids that played alot of video games and were only using 5% of there<br/>
brains.-=--=-<br/>
<br/>
He didn&#39;t &quot;show you.&quot;<br/>
He made an unfounded statement and you believed it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-How exactly they test that I am not sure...-=-<br/>
<br/>
Did you stop to consider that maybe they could NOT test it?<br/>
What would &quot;only using 5% of their brains&quot; look like?  How might it  <br/>
be proven, even with an autopsy?<br/>
If you&#39;d been watching Nova on PBS as you grew up, you&#39;d&#39;ve watched  <br/>
shows about brain research, I bet, and would have been more skeptical  <br/>
of a claim like that and not summarized someone&#39;s wild claim as &quot;he  <br/>
showed us.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;...  except that I know<br/>
that some kids lost the ability to see in three D and an Art teacher<br/>
had to take them out side and show them that this tree was actually<br/>
farther away then that tree. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Whoa!!!!  Wait.<br/>
How do you &quot;know&quot; that?<br/>
<br/>
-=-How exactly they test that I am not sure except that I know -=-<br/>
<br/>
You admit you don&#39;t understand, but then you say you know.<br/>
<br/>
-=-How exactly they test that I am not sure except that I know<br/>
that some kids lost the ability to see in three D and an Art teacher<br/>
had to take them out side and show them that this tree was actually<br/>
farther away then that tree. -=-<br/>
<br/>
So you&#39;re unfamiliar with kids who have played a lot of video games,  <br/>
yet you use the words &quot;showed&quot; and &quot;know.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I am familiar with kids who have played a lot of video games, and  <br/>
with adults who play video games, and they are artists themselves,  <br/>
and engineers, and construction workers and professional drivers and  <br/>
phone techs and one&#39;s a med student, and if they&#39;ve lost their  <br/>
ability to see in 3D, we&#39;re all in trouble (and they&#39;ll be hammering  <br/>
and incising their own thumbs).<br/>
<br/>
-=-For me watching tv puts me in tunnel vision and takes me away from<br/>
hearing my inner voices -=-<br/>
<br/>
If you grew up without TV, and you don&#39;t have TV, then when you see  <br/>
TV you&#39;re probably hearing LOTS of voices in your head, saying things  <br/>
like  &quot;I shouldn&#39;t be doing this&quot; or &quot;What if I had watched this my  <br/>
whole life?&quot; or &quot;Where if the subliminal boogey man?&quot; and it would be  <br/>
hard to relax and see the show receptively with all that brainwave  <br/>
noise.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Is it really allowing<br/>
for a young child to choose for themself when they are bombarded with<br/>
commertials that push hard for kids to get addicted to say soda etc?<br/>
Is that really freedom of choice for them?. Those advertising<br/>
companies study extensively how to brainwash kids into wanting there<br/>
stuff and the government does not protect the people from very toxic<br/>
ingredients in some so called food that is directly targeted towards<br/>
children.(Aspertame, propalene glysol etc.)-=-<br/>
<br/>
Your thinking is very, very muddled.  You can&#39;t tell the broadcast of  <br/>
a Shakespeare play from aspertane.  You can&#39;t spell &quot;aspartane,&quot; but  <br/>
you&#39;re basing your life on fear of it.<br/>
<br/>
aspartame |ˈaspärˌtām| |ˌøspɑrˈteɪm| |əˌspɑːteɪm|<br/>
noun<br/>
a very sweet substance used as an artificial sweetener, chiefly in  <br/>
low-calorie products. It is a derivative of aspartic acid and  <br/>
phenylalanine.<br/>
------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
My kids watch TV, but they don&#39;t use aspartame or any artificial  <br/>
sweeteners.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Now I am all about letting go of fear and expanding my awareness..<br/>
First you have to be aware of the fear. I did not see myself as<br/>
fearing tv for my children before, but now I see where the fear has<br/>
been instilled in me.-=-<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re going to make counter arguments not just for your own sake, but  <br/>
for the other hundreds who read here, so we don&#39;t &quot;have to be aware&quot;  <br/>
of your fear, we just need to be honest with our responses.    <br/>
Remember that this is not just about you.  The questions are asked so  <br/>
that you will think about your own arguments more clearly (and others  <br/>
who are reading the exchange will think about their own beliefs more  <br/>
clearly).<br/>
<br/>
-=-I have never heard anything that challenged thier validity until  <br/>
now.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Without knowing both sides of an argument, how could you have fairly  <br/>
judged the one side you did hear?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-90049378">-=-I think the same could be said of my earlier<br/>
example of horses. I come across a lot of people who are scared of  <br/>
horses<br/>
and of what could happen around them and who therefore don&#39;t let their<br/>
children have access to them. -=-<br/>
<br/>
If there were  horses in most buildings and homes, if people couldn&#39;t  <br/>
get around without horses, if horses were a vital part of everyday  <br/>
culture, then fear of horses would be a bigger problem.   In 1850,  <br/>
fear of horses would be a serious disadvantage.  In 2007, fear of TV  <br/>
is a serious disadvantage.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I still don&#39;t see why TV should be in a special category. To me it<br/>
is in the same category as the things you mention, or horses, or  <br/>
whatever<br/>
interests anyone.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
Because TV isn&#39;t just one thing.  It&#39;s access to a world of different  <br/>
kinds of information, music, stories, geography, history, humor,  <br/>
shows about horses!<br/>
<br/>
To say &quot;no TV&#39; is parallel to saying &quot;no books&quot; or &quot;no magazines&quot; or  <br/>
&quot;no toys.&quot;  To prohibit a class of things without regard to the  <br/>
benefit and value of parts of them is prejudice and ignorance and  <br/>
limitation.<br/>
<br/>
A better analogy with horses would be for someone to say &quot;NO ANIMALS&quot;  <br/>
because they were afraid of horses, and keep their kids away from  <br/>
cats, from watching birds in the yard, from going to the zoo, from  <br/>
having stuffed animals, from drawing pictures of elephants...<br/>
<br/>
-=-If it is important to have a TV in the house, available for people  <br/>
to use if<br/>
they choose, then why is it not equally important to have a reed  <br/>
organ (or a<br/>
horse) available for the same reason? -=-<br/>
<br/>
It takes way more than musical intelligence to use or need (or want)  <br/>
an organ or a guitar.  It takes desire and ability and time and  <br/>
practice to be able to play the instrument, and keep it in repair (or  <br/>
willingness to pay someone else for repairs when needed).  It&#39;s a big  <br/>
investment of space and time.<br/>
<br/>
It takes more than a vague interest in horses to own one.  You need  <br/>
space, physical ability, zoning, HOURS of attention, willingess to  <br/>
spend money on tack and vets and that&#39;s all even before desire,  <br/>
ability and time to train the horse and give it all the attention it  <br/>
needs.<br/>
<br/>
A TV can be bought for $80 and just sit there.  Anyone can press &quot;on&quot;  <br/>
and maybe watch Hamlet or Sesame Street or Boston Legal or Eddie  <br/>
Izzard, and any one of those things will lead them to music, costume,  <br/>
culture, geography, history, clever turns of phrases, politics...<br/>
<br/>
like this:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/connections">http://sandradodd.com/connections</a><br/>
<br/>
If the person who pressed &quot;on&quot; doesn&#39;t like what&#39;s there, she can  <br/>
press &quot;off.&quot;<br/>
Not so with a horse.<br/>
Not so with musical instruments.  (They can be set down to gather  <br/>
dust, though, while a horse can&#39;t ethically be.)<br/>
