<div id="ygrps-yiv-1622946195">Aha! This is the kind of person I was hoping to meet!! On one of the local lists I belong to, there&#39;s no controversy allowed! As soon as anyone mentions an iffy topic (last one was vaccination) the list owner demands silence!!. before a discussion even starts.....boring.......<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really enjoying this list. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve introduced my self yet. I&#39;m Kerrin, I live in New Zealand. My 5 unschooled kids are blossoming after nearly 3 years out of school. I have taken all that time to deschool myself and I&#39;m now feeling confident, most of the time. I&#39;ve almost jumped into a couple of discussions, but been too busy. Any time now I&#39;ll reach the point where I can&#39;t help myself!<br/>

   I got kicked off a list!!.................. <br/>
  I was too radical and they decided to quickly silence me.<br/>
  sigh....<br/>
