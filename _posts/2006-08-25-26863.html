<div id="ygrps-yiv-704618881">My almost 5 year old daughter, Olivia, is breaking the code and <br/>
learning to read and write.  Her process is so much fun to watch I <br/>
wanted to share a bit of it.  <br/>
<br/>
Olivia has always been curious about most everything and loves to be <br/>
read to and in the last couple of weeks she has been copying words <br/>
on to the blackboard wall in our kitchen and calling out long <br/>
strings of letters and asking me, &quot;What does that spell?&quot;  Yesterday <br/>
she said, &quot;Mommy don&#39;t look,&quot; when she wrote on the board <br/>
and when she asked me to look she had written the word &quot;LEGO.&quot;  I <br/>
was amazed not only that she could write the word but that she had <br/>
seen it on a Lego container and remembered it--she wasn&#39;t looking at <br/>
the word when she wrote it!  Then she wrote the number 10 and asked <br/>
me which number that was. Her process is so amazing.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been unschooling for 2 years now and our house has become a <br/>
more peaceful and  a happier place to be.  I&#39;ve learned to trust my <br/>
children and I am a better parent and a better thinker.<br/>
<br/>
In the beginning of our homeschooling I bought a curriculum and our <br/>
experiment with school at home lasted about day when I realized it <br/>
was completely offensive to my older daughter (and to me!)  Sarah (7 <br/>
years now) wanted nothing to do with school at home but we did enjoy <br/>
reading some of the books and using up the stuff that came with it.  <br/>
Otherwise it was an expensive ($500) lesson on stuff we don&#39;t need.  <br/>
Money we now spend on trips and museums and stuff the kids want or <br/>
are interested in.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this long post is to say how exciting life is when you <br/>
trust your children and support them--and to say thank you to the <br/>
experienced unschoolers who post here.  I&#39;ve learned so much but I <br/>
do get frustrated with newbies who post and then seem to fight every <br/>
bit of wisdom that is so graciously given.  <br/>
<br/>
BTW, my mother told me today that Sarah needed to be in a Montessori <br/>
School (?!) and I told her, no, Sarah is better off home with me.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-172226617">Thank you for sharing.  It&#39;s always so encouraging, no<br/>
matter how great or small, to hear others&#39; stories.  I<br/>
really think that helps us all who still might have<br/>
that smidgen of a voice in the back of heads wondering<br/>
if we&#39;re doing the right thing by unschooling.  These<br/>
stories put those nagging doubts to rest, don&#39;t you<br/>
think?  <br/>
<br/>
Bravo for Olivia!  And for you, SuperMom!<br/>

reading: &quot;Are you going to get a curriculum now?&quot;. I replied &quot;No! If <br/>
she can learn to read without one I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll need one for <br/>
anything else.&quot; <br/>
