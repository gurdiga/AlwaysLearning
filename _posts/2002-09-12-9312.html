<div id="ygrps-yiv-1121795304">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
These ideas of bedtime, control, and the young woman are very interesting.<br/>
Surrendering and trusting the young people we get to see grow up is so<br/>
difficult. First, the safety of life, the hold my hand, slow down when you<br/>
eat, small pieces please, watch the street then cross, two hands on the<br/>
scooter. At some point along the way, these little people really do know how<br/>
to be responsible. I see it with Tessa, almost 3 on some things, alot with<br/>
Riley, 5.5, and Ashley at almost 8 seems to know how to be in the world.<br/>
<br/>
Right now I was controlling Tessa. She is playing with homemade playdough we<br/>
cooked up about 45 minutes ago. She wants to mix in more flour. I told her she<br/>
had enough. Why? Two reasons, I see a potential mess I get to clean up and she<br/>
will make the playdough too dry. My deal. I gave her more flour and told her<br/>
sorry for not listening right away. <br/>
<br/>
Controlling the kids seems to creep into our lives so easily. I hear parents<br/>
all the time telling kids not to do this or that at the playground. Throwing<br/>
sand yes, but climbing up the slide when no one else is playing on it does not<br/>
seem reasonable.<br/>
<br/>
I like this discussion,<br/>
<br/>
Mary H. (who married an introvert and is still learning to respect his out<br/>
side of the group needs). Makes it difficult sometimes to do exciting crowd<br/>
activities, like fairs and festivals, yet boy do we have fun on our own in the<br/>
woods and beaches. I also have learned to ts=ake the kids to group things with<br/>
another family and ask Tim if he wants to join us. No expectations.</div>
