<div id="ygrps-yiv-908321836">I hadn&#39;t heard the term &quot;appeasement parenting&quot; before receiving this <br/>
in my email this morning.  I wasn&#39;t even entirely sure what the <br/>
connotations of &quot;appeasement&quot; really were, so I looked it up and the <br/>
first definition I found was:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The policy of granting concessions to potential enemies to maintain peace.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is the beginning of a long email that, in the end, is selling a <br/>
book called, &quot;How to Get a Grip on Parenting.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
***********<br/>
<br/>
*Puberty Gets Blame for Appeasement Parenting*<br/>
<br/>
By Dr. Ronald E. Johnson, C.Ph.D.<br/>
<br/>
A Christian father recently said, &quot;I had a great relationship with my <br/>
daughter until puberty came along.&quot; With deep sorrow the father related <br/>
how his daughter became rebellious, untruthful, disobedient, and sensual <br/>
as she entered adolescence. She no longer wanted to participate in <br/>
family activities or talk about spiritual interests. A great &quot;wall&quot; <br/>
emerged between the daughter and her parents. Their values and lifestyle <br/>
were challenged and disobeyed by the angry, belligerent, and <br/>
self-focused girl, who yelled, slammed doors, and defied common sense.<br/>
****************<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying my teens and I never had any disagreements. There is a <br/>
fair amount of &quot;working things out&quot; that has to happen as children grow <br/>
into young adults. But when the stage is set in advance,  &quot;working it <br/>
out&quot; seems a natural part of life.  Yes, once in a while we really lost <br/>
our tempers at each other - rarely, but there were those times. But I <br/>
cannot even remotely imagine describing my teens as rebellious, <br/>
untruthful, disobedient, belligerent, etc. They were a JOY. An absolute <br/>
JOY.  My youngest is almost not-a-teen --- she&#39;ll be 20 in January. <br/>
Although I&#39;m enjoying my 20-something kids, too, I&#39;m going to miss the <br/>
teen years a lot.  The teen years are glorious. They are filled with <br/>
energy and exploration and intensity and deep examination of the purpose <br/>
and meaning of life. If we parents support their teens in pursuing THEIR <br/>
interests - fleeting ones as well as those with staying power - those <br/>
years will likely be the ones we look back on with the greatest pleasure <br/>
as a time of deep connection with our kids that then transforms into an <br/>
adult-to-adult friendship of a type that only can exist between parent <br/>
and grown child. It is amazing.  Please don&#39;t dread the teen years, but <br/>
start when kids are little to create family patterns of trust and <br/>
kindness and support. When kids are little is the time to learn, <br/>
together, to work out problems and conflicts in solution-oriented ways. <br/>
Put your relationship first, now, so that you&#39;ll HAVE a great <br/>
relationship to build on when your kids reach their teen years.<br/>

you have written and it will be a reminder to me of why we are choosing this<br/>
path with our son, and an enlightening story to share with anyone else<br/>
wondering why we live like we do.<br/>
<br/>
If not, thanks so much for giving me something to look forward to!<br/>
