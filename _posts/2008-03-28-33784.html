<div id="ygrps-yiv-816721704">I was on a path that felt so absolutely right to me.  I was coming <br/>
from a place of control and fear, to a place of love and trust.  I <br/>
had four children and wanted to give them a life that was joyful and <br/>
secure and help them to stay who they were.  I wanted to see them as <br/>
the perfect beings that they were and honor that.  Not, try to shape <br/>
them into something I felt they needed to be.  I was on a train that <br/>
was gaining momemtum.  I sometimes felt like I knew what a born again <br/>
christian felt like because I was so &quot;high&quot; in the way, this way of <br/>
living and thinking, made me feel.  I was learning so much and <br/>
challenging myself daily to be better and more patient and in the <br/>
now.   I could feel a hum of rightness in me that kept me on this <br/>
path.  When i slipped into old habits it felt wrong.  When I made <br/>
positive, concious choices it was so right.  My children were such <br/>
wonderful teachers.  They kept me on the path.  They challenged me.  <br/>
Sam was my biggest challenger.  A wonderful, sweet, funny, kind, <br/>
energetic  boy to all who knew him.  A boy who pushed every button I <br/>
had and kept pushing sometimes beyond my breaking point.  Before <br/>
unschooling, I made terrible choices in relating to him, after <br/>
unschooling, we started to find a way to understand each other.  He <br/>
never gave me a break though.  He always stood his ground.  As I <br/>
learned more and tried to be more present and understanding and <br/>
respectful, I began to understand what a gift he was to me.  We began <br/>
to understand each other more.  He started to let me in and trust <br/>
me.  His energy was so intense, I had trouble sometimes with patience <br/>
with him, but I knew that without him, I would not be able to work so <br/>
well on challenging myself to be more patient.  Just as I was really <br/>
beginning to understand that, Sam died.  I remember thinking, &quot;I <br/>
wasn&#39;t finished yet!  I need a lot more lessons from you!&quot;  I wish I <br/>
could say that through his death I found the strength to stay with <br/>
the momentum I was feeling and living.  I did not.  I withdrew.  I <br/>
went through I time of such intense emotion and then nothing.  I <br/>
closed it all up.  I didn&#39;t feel.  Most of my joy and anger and <br/>
saddness and hope were stuffed into a place and whenever a little of <br/>
it started to come out, I would stuff it back in fear of it all <br/>
coming out and causing me to lose my mind in all of it&#39;s intenseness. <br/>
People think I&#39;m &quot;amazing&quot; in the way I&#39;ve handled this.  I don&#39;t.  I <br/>
struggle not to numb myself with wine every night.  I wonder what all <br/>
those intense feelings are doing to my insides.  I mourn for my <br/>
children the loss of the mother that could have been.  Even though I <br/>
feel I have done well with them.  I have remained a positive, loving, <br/>
present mother with them, but they lost a big part of me that day.  I <br/>
can only be so present and so loving.  I have all the patience in the <br/>
world, but it&#39;s not through mindful practice, it&#39;s because impatience <br/>
takes some emotion and Iike I said I am lacking in a lot of that.   <br/>
About 2 years ago, I decided that we needed to do more with school.  <br/>
Jack was 9 and still not reading.  Jamie was 6 and though I knew she <br/>
could absolutely learn to read on her own (she showed a lot of <br/>
interest in reading unlike Jack) I decided we should start some <br/>
lessons.  And while we were at it and little daily math.  I decided <br/>
that unschooling wasn&#39;t as great as I thought it was.  What was <br/>
really happening is that I didn&#39;t have the energy or drive to do what <br/>
it takes to really unschool and I wanted some control in my life and <br/>
I was letting fear take over and I got back on that path.  I think I <br/>
justified it with the thinking that Jack was suffering because of his <br/>
lack of reading.  He wasn&#39;t getting to experience as much as he <br/>
should because he couldn&#39;t read yet.  I wouldn&#39;t sign him up for <br/>
things because of it.  Jack however NEVER expressed a problem with <br/>
his reading.  He never felt bad about it or embarrassed as far as I <br/>
could see.  I just justified that somewhere inside, he HAD to have a <br/>
problem with it.  A couple of weeks ago I decided that having them <br/>
copy pages out of books would be an easy way for them to write and <br/>
spell and read.  How easy would that be!?  So, we started that.  The <br/>
first day was fine.  After that, a lot of resistance.  The reading <br/>
and daily math had only ever met a little resistance(I kept it light <br/>
and it was never really daily), but the writing was the breaking <br/>
point for them.   Then the real clincher.  I have been working part <br/>
time and Jack asked if I was going to be working tomorrow.  When i <br/>
said no, he gave a disappointed &quot;awww&quot;.  I asked why he was <br/>
disapponted and he shrugged.  I said, is it cause you wouldn&#39;t have <br/>
to do school stuff.   And he said &quot;yeah&quot; with a smile.<br/>
Shit!  What have I become!?  Who have WE become.  I want my kids to <br/>
love to be around me.  My oldest went to high school for 9th grade.  <br/>
I think it was partly because when Sam died, she was left with 2 <br/>
younger siblings and a big gap between them.  She is 6 years older <br/>
than Jack.  She was unschooled for 8 years and it took her til her <br/>
senior year of high school (this year) before she wanted to spend any <br/>
of her free time away from her family.  She is such an awesome person <br/>
because she is who she is suppose to be, not some version of what I <br/>
thought she should be.   Why am I not doing that for my youngest 2!?  <br/>
As much as I know how awesome they are, I am letting fear make <br/>
decisions for me.  I need to stop.  I need to find my way back to the <br/>
path that was truely right for me and us.  I feel like I have been <br/>
living a lie for the last 2 years.  I need to find my truth again.  I <br/>
told Jack and Jamie that we wouldn&#39;t be doing &quot;school stuff&quot; any <br/>
more.  Now I know I can&#39;t turn back.  They will help me.  <br/>
I&#39;m not sure what I will need for this new journey.  I know <br/>
intellectually about unschooling.  I guess i just need to learn to <br/>
feel it again.  I think being active on this list may help.  It <br/>
helped me in the beginning, to express my ideas and opinions (old aol <br/>
boards).  <br/>
So I&#39;m fighting my way back.  I hope you&#39;ll be patient with me.<br/>

I&#39;m really glad to hear from you.  I had wondered how things were  <br/>
going for you.  I missed your words.<br/>
<br/>
I wish you had stuck around with us, but I&#39;m thinking maybe you do too.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome back.  Here&#39;s something cheery you or your kids might be  <br/>
interested in.  Or your husband! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Review for us how old your younger kids are now, please.  I&#39;m not  <br/>
good with math.   8 and 11?<br/>

<br/>
Yep.  I kept coming here and reading, hoping to find that spark, but <br/>
I got nothing.  It was Jacks comment that finally slapped me awake.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Very cool.  Bob always teases me that I know every lyric to every <br/>
song, but it&#39;s really only songs from the 70&#39;s that I&#39;m good with.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yep, 8 and 11.  <br/>
Just writing that post earlier has gotten me so excited.  I&#39;ve had a <br/>
few times I wanted to control the environment and stopped myself.  I <br/>
am starting to realize how far off track I really was.  I&#39;m feeling a <br/>
weight lift.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Can you think of it like honoring Sam&#39;s life, by giving your other kids<br/>
what you gave him?  I remember you too.  I had wondered about you on and<br/>
off and I don&#39;t even really know you.  So how about that?  If I have<br/>
been thinking about how you&#39;ve been, I&#39;ll bet others have too.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome back to unschooling!</div>

It&#39;s really great to &quot;hear&quot; your voice again Joanna. I think of your<br/>
family quite often with great fondness. Sam&#39;s name comes up at<br/>
conferences regularly.:)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad you&#39;re back. Sending a big, squishy unschooling hug your way....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1509874769">Yay Joanna&#39;s back!!!<br/>
I&#39;ve missed you. I got some perspective, lots of compassion and a Big HUG<br/>
for you, my friend.<br/>
I&#39;m still waiting to hear Spongebob, just so your DH knows ;) And I don&#39;t<br/>
think I&#39;m alone in connecting him to that song every time it&#39;s heard :D He&#39;s<br/>
a Legend! (and I wasn&#39;t even there...)<br/>

music for a living and has played in front of huge crowds before.  That <br/>
night was the first time I had ever seen him really nervous before a <br/>
performance.  Once he started to sing, it was all good.  <br/>
Thanks for the &quot;welcome backs&quot; everybody.  <br/>

and sang! It was pretty amazing to watch.:)<br/>
Everytime I hear that song I think of that night too. In fact, some of<br/>
us went up at the impromptu talent show at FLT last spring (a campout<br/>
for home/unschoolers in NC) and got the whole audience singing it. One<br/>
of the really fun Dads has a great pirate voice and he got us started.<br/>
So the Wilkinson fun and energy was present at the NC coast.<br/>
