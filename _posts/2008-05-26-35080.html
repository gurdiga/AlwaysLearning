<div id="ygrps-yiv-1040091436">My girls (almost 8 and 4 1/2) have some friends from the neighborhood that<br/>
go to public school. There are 3 boys (9, 9 & 7) and a girl (6). One of the<br/>
boys is pretty nice. One of them is pretty cocky and can get quite mean and<br/>
the other is just okay, but gets riled up by the cocky one. The girl is not<br/>
nice at all. She doesn&#39;t listen and Lilly (4 1/2) and her end up doing a lot<br/>
of things that they aren&#39;t supposed to be doing. Like they will put sand,<br/>
dirt, etc on the trampoline when I go in to go to the bathroom real quick.<br/>
In general, the kids (especially when all of them are together) don&#39;t<br/>
listen.<br/>
<br/>
So, here is what is bothering me a bit. My girls have started to pick up the<br/>
mean and rude behavior. They have become quite demanding of me. &quot;How long<br/>
does it take to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich&quot; Marti (8) said to<br/>
me just a few minutes ago with &quot;that&quot; tone. This was less than a minute<br/>
after she had asked me to make the sandwich. Last night I was washing<br/>
Lilly&#39;s hair and she said to me, &quot;give me some&quot; about the shampoo. I knew<br/>
that she wanted to put it in her own hair and I was getting ready to give<br/>
her some when she said that, but again, it was in &quot;that&quot; tone.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, now the thing I am wanting help with is my reaction. How do I react<br/>
when I just want to revert to conventional things and say &quot;I am not a<br/>
waitress&quot; or &quot;Don&#39;t talk to me like that&quot; which I haven&#39;t done, by the way.<br/>
What would/did you all do when you were greeted with rude behavior seemingly<br/>
brought on by other people&#39;s kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-69801518">I would count to ten, or twenty :) Then, in as calm and sweet a tone as<br/>
possible, I would tell her it bothers me when you use that demanding tone<br/>
with me, or I don&#39;t like the feeling I get when you talk to me that way, or<br/>
something like that. I would make it about you, not about her, and then make<br/>
a specific request for her to change that. Or, I might try humor. With the<br/>
sandwich, I might have invited her to a sandwich-making race between the two<br/>
of you. Or an &quot;experiment&quot; where she estimates the number of minutes and<br/>
then tries to beat that time herself.<br/>
At a separate time, maybe after having noticed an instance of the neighbor<br/>
kids being rude, I would bring it up to your daughter as an observation, and<br/>
ask her what *she* thinks of that sort of behavior. Does it bothered her<br/>
if/when she is treated that way? I don&#39;t see anything wrong in telling her<br/>
that you don&#39;t like it, in the context of a thoughtful conversation where<br/>
you are not passing judgment but genuinely connecting with her.<br/>

say &quot;I&#39;m happy to do X for you, but I like it better when you ask me<br/>
nicely.&quot;  This doesn&#39;t mean please, it just means pleasant words in a<br/>
pleasant tone of voice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1856079238">I would limit my kids contact with them.  I think its harder to do that when the rude kids are family i.e cousins but when they are neighborhood kids I just cut it right off at the start. My son plays baseball and 1 kid on there is just nasty.  He said at the last game that he wanted to play with one of the other players pink bats. I thought wow, for him that is good.  Then another kid teased him and said that pink is not for boys, which in turn the nasty boy said &quot;well pink is for pimps too&quot;.  This kid is 8yo.  I was dumbfounded. When I hear things like that I thanks God that my kids are homeschooled. But I am always right there behind the bench watching and listening and the kids know it.  I am not afraid to tell them whent hey are misbehaving and being rude.  Although this is easier in this environment becasue there are rules about sitting on the bench and supporting the team.  But I have many friends whose kids i don&#39;t bring my kids to play with.  My kids even notice<br/>
 when other kids are rude and they ask not to go back to play with them.  I try not to shelter my kids but I also try to limit their interactions with kids that are just not nice.  1more short story...I went to my first homeschool birthday party for my cousins daughter.  It was the most laid back, subdued, non-stressfull party I have ever went to.  NO parents were yelling at their kids, the kids were polite, they focused on the presentation...I really was just a nice party. I told my cousin that afterwards and I really didn&#39;t want the party to be over.  3 hours of no yelling, discipline nothing!  I was astonished.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Sorry ranted a bit there.  But I would limit the time spent. Then when they do play together I would be on top of everything those kids say. If they are in your yard then they play by your rules or they can leave. If they want to be nice and respectful then they can stay. Otherwise they need to leave until they can be nice.  Good luck!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t have a problem telling one of my kids or any other for that <br/>
matter, &quot;don&#39;t talk to me like that&quot;.  I don&#39;t see a problem with <br/>
saying that.  Generally I&#39;ll also say, &quot;I&#39;m happy to do ____, just <br/>
ask me nicely next time will you please?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My kids rarely talk like that to me.  When they do, it is always <br/>
because of other stress in their lives, and they get snappish with or <br/>
without realizing it.  One of my kids almost always apologizes later <br/>
and the other younger one is just starting to understand the whole <br/>
apology thing.<br/>
<br/>
As for rude neighbors, I generally set the guidelines up front as <br/>
soon as I recognize a problem.  Mostly kids have always wanted to <br/>
play at our house, so they follow the rules that I give them, because <br/>
if they don&#39;t, I send them home.  One of the rules with these <br/>
situations is to play nice, and that includes talking nicely.  If <br/>
they really can&#39;t get that, then I don&#39;t want them here playing with <br/>
my kids and my kids don&#39;t really want to be put in a position of <br/>
dealing with big meanies on a regular basis.<br/>
<br/>
Often times I have asked my kids specifically how they want me to <br/>
handle other kids.  They almost always have really good ideas of how <br/>
they want it to play out.  One solution that came out of one of those <br/>
conversations was to have the tv off when a certain kid was over, <br/>
something I wouldn&#39;t have thought to do, but my own kid knew it would <br/>
work and it did.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-628788721">It is funny you mention this as I am dealing with it also this week.  We went to an unschoolers conference this weekend.  Life is Good in Vancouver WA.  My daughter came home and has been trying on all sorts of behaviors that aren&#39;t in her normal repertoire.  Like, &quot;I want ice cream for dinner.&quot;  We spend a lot of time apart while I went to adult sessions and she was off having tons of fun with her friends.  I think we need to re-establish connection.  I know this will pass or settle down in a few days so I am just seeing it as humorous right now.  I used to think that I had to &quot;fix&quot; all of these little things but now I trust that our family values, mores will win out as long as the connection is intact.<br/>
If my children were acting out in this way I might look at the last couple of days and see if there were times that we failed to connect or if I had been too busy.  If all had been normal, I might see it as her trying on some new behaviors and make sure she was aware if she had hurt my feelings.<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

If you are on the edge of reverting to &quot;I am not a waitress,&quot; maybe  <br/>
you haven&#39;t moved far enough from &quot;I have rights&quot; and &quot;You can&#39;t push  <br/>
me around&quot; kinds of thoughts, to the knowledge that if you make their  <br/>
lives really, truly, safe and comfortable, they will BE safe and  <br/>
comfortable, and most problems dissolve, including your own  <br/>
insecurities about whether you&#39;ll get enough space/freedom/attention/ <br/>
credit.<br/>

going through our refridgerator. Very strange. <br/>

Total sense.  Some kids I&#39;ve been kinda &quot;back in your face&quot; at have  <br/>
completely warmed up to me and started spilling (either then or the  <br/>

<br/>
I think it&#39;s pure, natural, helpful instinct to want your child to  <br/>
have advantages over others.  And it&#39;s instinct to resent having to  <br/>
help others&#39; kids behave well.  Some instincts are worth resisting  <br/>
and overcoming.  Others are okay to just relax right into!<br/>

He would come over after school and they&#39;d be playing in our backyard  <br/>
or on our swingset and he&#39;d be using the same kinds of taunts and  <br/>
insults used on school playgrounds since at least the 1950&#39;s.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
It was technicolor school stuff.<br/>
<br/>
You could ask.  You could ask if that&#39;s they way things are at their  <br/>
house or if it&#39;s stuff from school, if you wanted to.  But in any  <br/>
case you could say you don&#39;t like that behavior at your house.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1228393709">Hi Sandra:<br/>
Not knowing me you may assume that I had control issues around food from this post.  This is why I have such a hard time of it when I have a babe in arms and have to be so brief.  <br/>
If she (almost 8) would have been serious about ice cream for dinner, I would have taken her seriously.  But I sensed that she was looking for a reaction from me.  She did this pause...then look at me thing.  This dynamic usually isn&#39;t part of our relationship so I was taken by surprise.  She knew that she had had the freedom to make that choice if she was serious because of the trust she has in me and our relationship; because the way I have responded to her for the last 7 years.<br/>
I am guessing that she saw kids in the hall in the hotel at the conference having a hard time with their parents around food choice and she wanted to see if she still had freedom.  She also said &quot;no&quot; to me when I asked her for something that day.  I don&#39;t know if she has ever said that to me.  I think I responded with &quot;okay&quot; and then laughed at that too.  I love that she was expressing her autonomy and it made me happy, so I laughed.  Not a condescending type, but happy type of laugh.<br/>
At this point in my parenting I do find quite a few things funny that I took more seriously in the past.   Often times laughter has helped me through some stressful situations and it keeps me light. Why do you find humor in that situation concerning?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1815633648">Well, I think I made a GIANT mistake by using such a wide label for so<br/>
many things.  Sugar!  I&#39;m not anti-sugar but, I do notice that when my<br/>
oldest son eats high sugar food items (this is a wide range honey,<br/>
peanut butter, candy, ice cream, maple syrup) he becomes REALLY<br/>
excitable and active, then sort of melts down into a very weepy,<br/>
tired, and angry fellow.  This is where I learned to have protein<br/>
ready.  It seems to help balance him out.  I understand that one might<br/>
say he didn&#39;t have enough protein earlier in the day, but it&#39;s not<br/>
always the case.  He&#39;s has specifically asked me not to give him<br/>
certain foods because they make his heart race and make him feel tired.  <br/>
<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t it be true that one child could metabolize sugar differently<br/>
than another?  I can&#39;t see any excess of excitement about candy here.<br/>
 Maybe a little?  It&#39;s yummy!  But it&#39;s always available.  (Even more<br/>

I told him he wasn&#39;t in trouble. He kept running back and forth. He <br/>

Were you babysitting him or was he over for a visit? That would make  <br/>
a little bit of difference.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve agreed to be responsible for his safety, then it&#39;s  <br/>
important for him to listen to you.<br/>
<br/>
If he wandered into the yard kinda like the dog did, and he won&#39;t  <br/>
stop when you tell him to, either the dog could stop him (and you  <br/>
could garden hose the dog) or you might have been over-reacting and  <br/>
the dog wasn&#39;t a danger.  If he kept running and running and the dog  <br/>
wasn&#39;t on him, then letting him keep running doesn&#39;t seem so bad.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Perhaps he knew that dog and didn&#39;t see any danger.  Perhaps he isn&#39;t<br/>
afraid of dogs and didn&#39;t sense anything untoward with the dog.<br/>
<br/>
Dogs bounding through yards aren&#39;t inherently dangerous, they could be,<br/>
but one can generally get a sense of the dog almost immediately.   In my<br/>
own experience I would be overreacting if I had responded in the way you<br/>
had.  My kids would&#39;ve fussed because they can sense when I&#39;m<br/>
overreacting.<br/>
<br/>
Even though you said he wasn&#39;t in trouble and that you weren&#39;t angry,<br/>
you clearly wanted and expected him to do something on your command. <br/>
Some kids do not respond well to that for many reasons, either they are<br/>
used to being commanded and fear punishment, or they aren&#39;t used to<br/>
being commanded and don&#39;t like to be.<br/>
<br/>
I might have pointed out the stray dog and made a statement to use<br/>
caution, with possible added instructions like move slowly until we see<br/>
if the dog is nice.<br/>
<br/>
I try really hard not to parent out of fear or make fear based parenting<br/>
decisions.  Using caution, helping a kid use caution is a very different<br/>
thing.</div>

how she eats. We offer her lots of different foods and if we are<br/>
eating something I would never feel right saying that she can&#39;t have<br/>
what we are eating! <br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I have already seen my daughter stop eating something when<br/>
she is full/done. (She&#39;s almost 2). She has done this a couple of<br/>
times with ice cream. <br/>
<br/>
This other mother has said that her son would eat sweets all day long<br/>
if you let him (I already know what most people here think about<br/>
statements like these, and I agree!) <br/>
<br/>
My question is about another statement she made though. I said<br/>
something about how children (babies in particular) will stop eating<br/>
when they are full (if they are allowed to eat when they are hungry).<br/>
She said very matter-of-factly -- &quot;until they are 2 (years old)&quot; (I<br/>
should also mention that she is a doctor and specialized in eating<br/>
disorders.) Now to me, this statement seems a little ridiculous. I<br/>
mean, what happens at 2, all of a sudden they just start over-eating?<br/>
More likely, if they have been controlled or restricted, the<br/>
socialization of eating starts being more of a factor. But what if<br/>
kids aren&#39;t restricted and instead are offered a wide-variety of<br/>
foods, including healthy choices? Shouldn&#39;t they continue to listen to<br/>
their bodies?<br/>
<br/>
Just curious to hear what others&#39; opinions and experiences are about<br/>
this. (Especially as my daughter turns 2 in about a month! :-)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1629025031">This is a link to a PBS program on this subject.  You can click on the<br/>
&quot;watch online&quot; to see the video of the episode.  Their conclusion is what<br/>
has been said here all along.  More restriction results in kids eating MORE<br/>
of what they are not &quot;allowed&quot; to eat.  The kids who has access to any food<br/>
at home, were not as interested in scarfing down everything on their plates.<br/>
