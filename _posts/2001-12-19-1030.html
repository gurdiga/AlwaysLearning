<div id="ygrps-yiv-977360283">I&#39;m just taking a few bits from a short article called &quot;Socialization or <br/>
Social Development,&quot; by Linda Kreger Silverman. The article is really about <br/>
gifted kids, but it provides one of the best, most articulate, responses to <br/>
questions about &quot;socialization&quot; that a homeschooler could want. The stuff in <br/>
quotes is from the article. <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.gifteddevelopment.com/Articles/Social%20Development.html)">http://www.gifteddevelopment.com/Articles/Social%20Development.html)</a><br/>
<br/>
&quot;Indeed, the remarkable emphasis on the school as an agent of socialization <br/>
makes one wonder if anyone really cares about the development of these <br/>
children’s abilities or if all that is important is whether they fit in!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She says she wants to differentiate between socialization and social <br/>
development and that socialization is the ability to adapt to the needs of a <br/>
group. Then she says: <br/>
<br/>
&quot;But at what price? If one works very hard at fitting in with others, <br/>
especially when one feels very different from others, self-alienation can <br/>
result.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then, this is the part I really like, she talks about &quot;social development&quot; as <br/>
something different than &quot;socialization.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Social development, on the other hand, is not the pressure to adapt, but a <br/>
deep, comfortable level of self -acceptance that leads to true friendships <br/>
with others.<br/>
<br/>
Lasting friendships are based on mutual interests and values, not on age. <br/>
Individuals with good social development like themselves, like other people, <br/>
demonstrate concern for humanity, and develop mutually rewarding friendships <br/>
with a few kindred spirits. Social development goes hand in hand with <br/>
self-actualization, whereas socialization is merely the desire to conform – <br/>
often the opposite of self-actualization.&quot;<br/>

ps I forwarded the link on to one of my sons. He<br/>
tested (yup...we did it officially....about 20+ years<br/>
ago) way on up there in the super genious levels<br/>
and,as a child, he always had trouble finding peers,<br/>
EXCEPT in the &quot;grassroots, free school&quot; circles. Now I<br/>
wonder why that was? :-) This held true for my other<br/>
boys, as well. <br/>
