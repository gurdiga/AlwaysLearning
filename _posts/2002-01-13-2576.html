<div id="ygrps-yiv-734890188">In response to &quot;dancing the dance&quot; with my husband before.  My belief <br/>
is the same as yours.  You know if you&#39;ve know someone before or <br/>
not.  Deja vu.......part of the blueprint that your on track.  <br/>
<br/>
I had thousands of questions until everyone of them was answered in a <br/>
book by Sylvia Brown called &quot;The other side and back&quot;.  May sound <br/>
hokey to some people but &quot;religion&quot; could never answer any of them.  <br/>
A friend of mine had to push the book down my throat.....I thought <br/>
she was so silly.  Now I am so at the final understanding. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Now this is where we part company. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever be at the final <br/>
understanding. Thinking any one source has all the answers, be it religion <br/>
or science or the stars, closes too many doors of opportunity for me.<br/>
