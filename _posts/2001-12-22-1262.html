<div id="ygrps-yiv-1709230310">I&#39;m working on giving up control in a number of areas with my dd, 11.  I<br/>
could see that the way I&#39;d been was creating an unnecessary amount of<br/>
conflict and I&#39;ve learned a lot from people here.  But sometimes I get<br/>
confused about what my rights are and I tend to think in black and white<br/>
and get lost in the gray areas.  I&#39;m questioning myself and how I want<br/>
to be a lot these days.<br/>
<br/>
So I thought I&#39;d throw this out.<br/>
<br/>
We just bought a new truck that doesn&#39;t have air bags so it is possible<br/>
for the first time in years for dd to sit in the front seat.  When there<br/>
were only two of us in the truck, no problem, she sat in the front seat<br/>
and thrilled in her position.  Because dh does most, if not all of the<br/>
driving (for which I&#39;m grateful), this morning she said to me, &quot;You&#39;re<br/>
going to have to get used to sitting in the back seat because I&#39;m going<br/>
to want to sit in the front seat.&quot;  My response was, &quot;Let&#39;s talk about<br/>
it later&quot; because I don&#39;t know what I want to say or do.<br/>
<br/>
Recently, we got into a struggle over my favorite seat in the living<br/>
room.  I thought it through and decided to start sitting somewhere<br/>
else.  Soon she wanted my new seat so I took back my old seat.  I know<br/>
it&#39;s not only about the seat.  I think it&#39;s also about being treated<br/>
fairly and as an equal.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose this might happen with the truck seating too but the problem<br/>
is I really don&#39;t want to sit in the back seat and  I&#39;m having a bit of<br/>
a temper tantrum over it.  We&#39;re going to take a year long trip in this<br/>
truck and I&#39;d really rather not do it from the back seat.  I just can&#39;t<br/>
think of a valid reason why I should always get to sit in the front seat<br/>
or even most of the time.  Why shouldn&#39;t it be equal if she wants it<br/>
equal?  Occasionally in the car, I used to join her in the back seat<br/>
because she didn&#39;t want to be alone (only child).  But if I have to<br/>
choose between driving and sitting in the back seat half of the time,<br/>
ugh.<br/>
<br/>
I know this isn&#39;t an earth shattering issue but I hope to be<br/>
enlightened.  Do you let your kids sit in the front seat when they want<br/>
to even if it means you have to sit in the back seat?  Or how do you<br/>
decide who sits where and when?<br/>

<br/>
Rotate?<br/>
<br/>
I claim front seat if I&#39;m there and kids get the back, unless we&#39;re going a <br/>
long way and then we switch out a lot.<br/>
<br/>
Or sometimes I let one of them have the front, but it&#39;s mine to grant.<br/>
<br/>
We do a precedence by age and visitor-status on the front seat.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I just can&#39;t<br/>
think of a valid reason why I should always get to sit in the front seat<br/>
or even most of the time. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re taller, you&#39;re older.<br/>
<br/>
There are stops for gas and sodas and food and you could switch off.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Do you let your kids sit in the front seat when they want<br/>
to even if it means you have to sit in the back seat?  Or how do you<br/>
decide who sits where and when?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If we have company, they get first dibs on the front.<br/>
<br/>
If we&#39;re in a car with seats that go backward and up, we arrange by height.  <br/>
I&#39;m the second to shortest in my family now, and I would defer to Marty or <br/>
Kirby to let them have legroom.  But then I get carsick easily and there&#39;s <br/>
another credit for my front-seat account.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re usually in a minivan and so there&#39;s legroom other places too.<br/>

<br/>
Well - we have air bags in the Honda - so no kids in the front seat.  I get <br/>
car sick in the back, so even if they could sit up front, if I needed to , I <br/>
would.  When we go on trips with other people, I sit in front.  My kids <br/>
understand about that, so it&#39;s not an issue for us.  Sometimes if their dad <br/>
is in the car, they&#39;ve requested he sit back with them and I&#39;ve driven.   <br/>
<br/>
Giving up control over your child doesn&#39;t mean giving her control over you.  <br/>
And it sounds to me that&#39;s what&#39;s being tested here, particularly in the <br/>
favorite seat in the living room issue.  It sounds like she wants the seat <br/>
you want -- because you want it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;this morning she said to me, &quot;You&#39;re going to have to get used to sitting <br/>
in the back seat because I&#39;m going to want to sit in the front seat.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is also a power statement - it&#39;s not asking for negotiation, or <br/>
consideration of her desires.  It seems disrespectful, to me, and not in <br/>
terms of child to parent -- but in terms of family member to family member.  <br/>
How would you react if your spouse addressed you in that manner?<br/>
<br/>
I feel I have a right to personal space -- and feel my kids have it to.  <br/>
We&#39;ve got our own &quot;areas&quot; around the house, and it hasn&#39;t been an issue.  <br/>
Seems to me there&#39;s stuff going on beneath the surface -- perhaps in reaction <br/>
to the whole &quot;giving up control&quot; agenda?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There might be two things interacting here.<br/>
<br/>
It looks like a power struggle. If she&#39;s always felt like she had to back<br/>
down because you were bigger and more forceful and now you&#39;re giving ground,<br/>
it&#39;s going to feel like a long awaited opportunity to take it. It rather<br/>
resembles the interactions between the older social animal who has held top<br/>
position by intimidation who is growing weaker and begins backing off from<br/>
confrontation. The question in those vying for the top spot is how far can I<br/>
push? I doubt that it&#39;s really that exactly! ;-) but anyone who&#39;s felt<br/>
pushed her whole life if she feels she can now push back will naturally feel<br/>
justified in pushing back.<br/>
<br/>
And if you&#39;ve solved problems in which what she wants conflicts with what<br/>
you want by insisting on your way, she doesn&#39;t have any other model to draw<br/>
on for solving that type of problem. You&#39;ve probably modeled &quot;I&#39;ve got the<br/>
power to do what I want and make you do what I want&quot; so that&#39;s the model<br/>
she&#39;s emulating now that she feels like she has the power.<br/>
