We can&#39;t even TEACH them to walk and talk and run.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ah...but we COULD use a curriculum to make ourselves believe we were<br/>
teaching them to walk, talk and run. Then when they learned it anyway,<br/>
we&#39;d all pat ourselves on the back about what good homeschoolers we<br/>
were and thank the curriculum company for creating such a fabulous<br/>
curriculum...after all, it worked, right?;)<br/>
