<div id="ygrps-yiv-967787616">I am the raffle/silent auction coordinator  for the Life is Good  <br/>

being outbid on a particularly tempting auction basket.<br/>
<br/>
We already have an &quot;Instant Gratification Table&quot; with mostly little  <br/>
kid stuff for a $1 ticket, which helps. But both young and older kids  <br/>
have fallen apart when the results of the raffle and auction are known.<br/>

<br/>
Talk to parents about not getting kids&#39; hopes up.  Talk to the raffle  <br/>
personnel about not SELLING the idea of winning, but thanking them  <br/>
for the donation and letting them know what that money will be used  <br/>
for, maybe?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But mostly I would think don&#39;t have an raffle.<br/>
<br/>
If the purpose of unschooling is to make kids comfortable and help  <br/>
them learn,and if the purpose of the conferences is to help parents  <br/>
see unschooling at its best, and if a family&#39;s dynamics and  <br/>
personalities and dealings are such that somehow the parents made any  <br/>
kind of implied promise of raffles being about winning, or said  <br/>
ANYthing like &quot;Which thing do you want?&quot; then it&#39;s the parent&#39;s fault  <br/>
and not the kids&#39; problem for being sensitive.<br/>
<br/>
Raffles are about losing.   The majority of those who buy a raffle  <br/>
ticket for an item lose, even if there are only three tickets.    <br/>
Maybe it&#39;s not a good thing to do in a group of people who are  <br/>
working toward creating an environment in which each child is a  <br/>
winner (or whatever).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In school, not everyone will get an A, and that&#39;s even if everyone  <br/>
were to really try.  If too many people made A&#39;s, they&#39;d raise the  <br/>
hurdle, make the test harder or whatever.  A raffle with one winner  <br/>
and 200 losers is designed to keep the money of the losers.  It&#39;s  <br/>
gambling.  And honestly, in some (maybe all) states, it&#39;s not even  <br/>
legal unless the raffle tickets are issued by the state (or printed  <br/>
at an approved printshop, bonded, familiar with all the laws...) and  <br/>
registered and all kinds of legalities about what kind of group can  <br/>
hold a raffle and why and under what circumstances, and...<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that I haven&#39;t participated in raffles at unschooling  <br/>
conferences, but as soon as one kid&#39;s crying, it seems it wasn&#39;t  <br/>
worth the money that was gathered.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-380789733">The same thing happened at ARGH with the candy raffle.  Gee, *I* was<br/>
disappointed and I&#39;m not a kid (just love chocolate).  Here&#39;s an idea.<br/>
 Have gifts for all the kids rather than raffles.  The parents can be<br/>
given the heads up that there is a &quot;silent fundraiser&quot; to replace the<br/>
old raffle and for anyone who enjoyed seeing the kids getting stuff in<br/>
the past, the gifts for everyone could replace the raffle.    You know<br/>
I sort of fantasized for a second that it would be fun to have a<br/>
cotton candy machine and while the kids are gathered round getting<br/>
their cotton candy and/or just watching it being made, the adults<br/>
could be having the silent fundraiser donations taken up.<br/>

fundraising is for; however, I think paying for a service is a better <br/>
money maker in a situation like this.  I was in charge of my local <br/>
park&#39;s football/cheerleader kickoff last year and the kids LOVED the <br/>
snowcone machine.  I think it was $50 to rent and our park charged <br/>
$1.00 for each cup.  Personally I think they should have charged .50 <br/>
instead. They made $400 which I thought amazing off one snow cone <br/>
machine for a very small park.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-764588050">What is the purpose of the fundraiser?  I see fundraisers at  <br/>
conferences and I don&#39;t know WHY.  Scholarships.  Some families apply  <br/>
to get their conference fee free, at some ongoing conferences.  Maybe  <br/>
the fundraising is to provide seed money for the next year.   But the  <br/>
conferences don&#39;t exist to raise money.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s fun, great!  I&#39;ve seen &quot;passion baskets&quot; that were beautiful  <br/>
things to see and create and win, but as with anything else  <br/>
unschooling related, if it&#39;s not fun, why do it?<br/>

year to be given to all the children along with the winners of the<br/>
raffle.  My kids love raffles, and they don&#39;t even mind being<br/>
disappointed when they don&#39;t win, but then, we usually don&#39;t buy huge<br/>
amounts of tickets in the hope of winning either.  We usually will buy a<br/>
couple of tickets, and use the rest of our money for other purchases.  <br/>
So it&#39;s more like, we have $20 and we can use half for the raffle and<br/>
then you may buy whatever with the rest, so they are usually happy with<br/>
that because they get something wether or not they win and if they win,<br/>
then it&#39;s just an extra bonus.<br/>
<br/>
But then, Marguax usually wins things like raffles, so is not usually<br/>
let down.  However, I would have purchased stuff from the instant<br/>
gratification table, had she not won, and had she been so disappointed<br/>
that she was unable to let it go.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1092072328">i really like that idea - the raffle - and the silent auction - appealing to adults and not enticing/a let down for kids.  i have one of those sensitive kids, and, although we&#39;ve managed to work together to not get too worked up with hope/anticipation, it is still a let down for sure, if the cherished item isn&#39;t won....<br/>
<br/>
and he&#39;d *gladly* spend money on items for sale, rather than for raffle, so he could know just what he was getting.  I, on the other hand - LOVE silent auctions (not raffles as much, but i know others do) and would hate to see them discontinued.<br/>

For the Good Vibrations Conference I&#39;m organizing for September, the <br/>
money collected will be used to build a scholarship fund for future <br/>

Which would definitely cut way back on pining for stuff, and the<br/>
unintentional messing with the kids&#39; minds.   Much of the psychology<br/>
behind raffling is to create a feeling of scarcity and to encourage a<br/>
bid for the goods on display.  The whole point of donating for<br/>
conference seed funds and scholarships is lost if the prize is the<br/>
visual impetus for donation.  A lot like the whole point of school is<br/>
lost if the impetus for learning is grades.<br/>
<br/>
I thought about going for a scholarship a couple of years ago myself,<br/>
yet like others have said I feel that rethinking the raffle is spot on<br/>
since what anybody (not just kids) learns from them is not worth<br/>
emphasizing in my opinion.<br/>

At LIG last year there was a huge amount of stuff that was enticing to<br/>
kids on top of a table at the back of the room.  This was the part of<br/>
the room with a nice open area for younger kids to play quietly while<br/>
their parents watched the talk... It made it MUCH harder to go to any<br/>
talks.  If they had the raffle items at the front of the room and the<br/>
space in back was actually little kid friendly it would have been<br/>
sooooo much easier to make the conference work for me.  I made it to<br/>
about 10 minutes of talks total.  It was just too hard.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-915221587">I&#39;m really happy to see this discussion.  My two daughters are always  <br/>
intensly affected by the raffles one way or another.  The youngest is  <br/>
often beside herself with anticipation and then elated or devastated  <br/>
by the result.  Her intense personality is something we just love  <br/>
about her but raffles are hard and silent auctions are even harder.    <br/>
I remember feeling grateful at LIG a couple years ago simply because I  <br/>
felt the freedom to sit with her and help her through her feelings  <br/>
without feeling that all eyes were on us about it.  She is getting a  <br/>
bit more graceful about losing as she gets older (she&#39;s 8 now) but she  <br/>
still experiences the intense feelings just as strong as when she was  <br/>
three or four.<br/>

I would hate to see the whole thing go away - but exploring options  <br/>
about how to be as sensitive as possible is a good idea.</div>

<br/>
I don&#39;t see the advantage to unschooling conferences adopting a  <br/>
practice that causes so many people to be losers.   There are other  <br/>
ways to gather money into a pile, if that&#39;s really necessary.<br/>
<br/>
It seems that other conferences are copying slavishly from earlier  <br/>
Live and Learn conferences.  A good idea doesn&#39;t have to become a  <br/>
sacred tradition or granite-hard baserock of conferences.  And often  <br/>
a good idea seems good because it&#39;s new.  Once it&#39;s the 8th annual,  <br/>
the newness is all gone and it can start to accumulate the lost  <br/>
paperwork and disappointment and mismanagement (however small past  <br/>
problems were, they attach to it and build) of all the years before.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-286175027">&lt;&lt; It seems that other conferences are copying slavishly from earlier <br/>
Live and Learn conferences. A good idea doesn&#39;t have to become a sacred <br/>
tradition or granite-hard baserock of conferences. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one of the benefits of having the numerous conferences that have <br/>
sprung up around the US and Canada over the last few years: the variety <br/>
of conference and gathering experiences available.  L&L conferences were <br/>
wonderfully fun and inspiring but I don&#39;t think they&#39;ve become <br/>
entrenched as a sacred tradition.<br/>
<br/>
Each organizer can create the unique conference experience they most <br/>
want to share with others, and for some that may closely model the L&L <br/>
experience, and for others not as much.  For example, with sensitive <br/>
kids of my own, I chose not have a raffle at the Toronto conference and <br/>
have taken a different route with scholarships over the years, among <br/>
other things.<br/>
<br/>
One of the great lasting effects of L&L is the number of new conferences <br/>
it inspired, giving unschoolers a wider range of events to choose from.<br/>

anyone feels so inclined). Having a sensitive kid myself, I appreciate  <br/>
the feedback.<br/>

I have my own feelings of discomfort around the whole thing and have  <br/>
attempted to make some changes. I thought it was only me and maybe one  <br/>
other mum who felt this way.  So far, I hadn&#39;t  come up with anything  <br/>

Maybe they should all be things for adults--boring mom stuff. Or if <br/>
it&#39;s exciting, wrap it in brown paper and let the adults put tickets <br/>
in on things but find something else for the kids to do with their <br/>
tickets, if they buy any. Or don&#39;t sell any to kids.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a perfect idea, but it&#39;s a better idea than an array of cool <br/>
stuff and selling a kid something that turns out to be two days of <br/>
hope and then a big letdown. What learning purpose does THAT serve?<br/>

Lots of tacky rudeness and disappointment and frustration are &quot;life.&quot;<br/>
There are some parts of life that unschooling can prevent little kids  <br/>
from needing to experience.<br/>
<br/>
Football doesn&#39;t require medals and trophies.  Unschooling isn&#39;t about  <br/>
medals and trophies or being the anything-of-the-week.  Those are  <br/>
situations that create one winner and X-1 losers, X being the number  <br/>
of kids on the team, in the class, at the school, whatever.   Each  <br/>
award moment creates LOTS of losers.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not a good unschooling goal to have, nor situation to encourage.<br/>

<br/>
For sure it does create hey-what-about-me feelings in those so called<br/>
&quot;losers&quot; who rightly perceive themselves to be important as the next<br/>
person.  In any (probably unnecessarily) competitive event, the groups<br/>
of recipients and non-recipients aren&#39;t appreciably different.  It may<br/>
just so happen that effort yields the luck of the draw, not in<br/>
performance, but in having won.  I felt that way as I watched the<br/>
Super Bowl and saw both teams as really amazing in their own unique<br/>
combination of strengths and weaknesses.  The game itself filled me<br/>
with a sense of appreciation for their skill.  While the trophy moment<br/>
was all about disappointment and guilt and probably a hundred other<br/>
conflicting emotions.  Poo.  I wish it weren&#39;t like that.  Is it<br/>
really necessary?  Does a fire really have to be lit under someone&#39;s<br/>
butt to get them to move or do they move because they really can and<br/>
they enjoy it?<br/>

sense to foist that onto everyone, but it&#39;s not fair to the people  <br/>
who love it to see them as being manipulated by some fire lighter.<br/>
<br/>
Some towns nearby offer both competitive and noncompetitive adult  <br/>
sports teams (volleyball and basketball are coming to mind). One is  <br/>
not universally better than the other, but one is often better for  <br/>
one individual than another. Depends what they like.<br/>

Raffles are different, though. There&#39;s no sense of personal  <br/>
achievement. It&#39;s just luck (other than buying a whole lot of tickets!)<br/>

<br/>
What&#39;s best isn&#39;t always what is, though.<br/>
<br/>
Just this morning I was doing some SCA site stuff, and put up a backup  <br/>
copy of a scholarly article on folk music, using a particular region  <br/>
of the SCA (not where I live) to analyze the use of music, and how  <br/>
it&#39;s changed and passed on.    That&#39;s deeply interesting to me.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/sca/folkmusic">http://sandradodd.com/sca/folkmusic</a><br/>
and in the description of the community is this:<br/>
&quot;Sexual equality is well advanced. While the activities chosen by  <br/>
individuals still show a distinct gender bias, when it comes to actual  <br/>
power and respect within the SCA, males and females are almost (but  <br/>
not quite) equal. In eight of the last ten years the president of the  <br/>
SCA has been female.&quot;<br/>
I was most of that female presidency myself!  Cool mention.   I never  <br/>
had seen that article, because it was in a Canadian folklore journal  <br/>
in 1989, and I was busy having babies in New Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
SO ANYway, I linked a couple of pages to that.  One is a description  <br/>
of a &quot;bardic competition&quot; I designed and ran.  It was very smooth, and  <br/>
really good, and one way I prevented unhappiness with the judging is  <br/>
that anyone who wanted to and who stayed for the whole thing could be  <br/>
a judge.   I don&#39;t love competitions, but the first evening we used  <br/>
this format was fantastic, and the second time was at an international  <br/>
SCA thing, the 25th anniversary event, and it worked really smoothly  <br/>
then, too.<br/>
<br/>
Without it having been a competition, maybe only half as many people  <br/>
would&#39;ve shown up, and the quality of the individual performances  <br/>
would&#39;ve been lower, either because they weren&#39;t on high alert, as it  <br/>
were, or because they&#39;d be singing songs they liked for one reason or  <br/>
another, but weren&#39;t their best, or weren&#39;t the most period songs they  <br/>
knew.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like competitions, though, and for myself I prefer to do  <br/>
something because it&#39;s a useful, good thing to do.<br/>
<br/>
I have an article on music in the SCA, too.  It&#39;s an old one, from  <br/>
before I had kids.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/periodvocalmusic">http://sandradodd.com/periodvocalmusic</a><br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t do that for any competitive purpose, neither the singing nor  <br/>
the writing.<br/>

&quot;Modern education is competitive, nationalistic and separative. It has<br/>
trained the child to regard material values as of major importance, to<br/>
believe that his nation is also of major importance and superior to<br/>

with something new and different when I&#39;m in a studio or class.  New<br/>
for me anyway.  I like seeing what I can do.<br/>
<br/>
Even without awards, an interested audience is recognition.  Art for<br/>
me has nothing to do with competition even though getting the &quot;right&quot;<br/>
recognition can make it possible to get more shows, money and stuff to<br/>
put on a resume.  Others feel very differently, true.  They enjoy the<br/>

School children might not see themselves as part of a larger world<br/>
because the schoolthink all by itself along with national ideology or<br/>
bias has that effect.  In other words some of what I see is directly<br/>
attributable to schoolthink (a lassitude or something) and some are<br/>
derivative truisms blanketed onto other stuff.   Thoughts about<br/>
loyalty mix confusedly with thoughts about personal integrity, and<br/>
staying in those modes of thought makes it difficult to get clear.<br/>
