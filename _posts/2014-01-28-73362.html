<div id="ygrps-yiv-914488260"><div dir="ltr">This group and the Facebook group are really helping my deschooling process so thank you. I have been breaking the &quot;rules&quot; a bit. I still read a lot, try a little, wait a little and watch! Things are continually moving in a good direction with our 14 year old previously child led, eclectically homeschooled, youngest son. I think that my husband and I getting unschooling little by little is improving our relationships with each other and all three kids (the other two are 18 and 23) and I sure wish we would have been more open earlier. Such is life. Here we are and from here we&#39;ll move forward!<div>
<br></div><div>I do catch myself slipping. My son is wearing his pants low and I laugh or tell him to pull them up or whatever when I know that a 14 year old boy&#39;s fashion choice isn&#39;t going to end the world. Same with the music-sometimes very vulgar rap. I&#39;m working on this stuff and it really has come a long way.</div>
<div><br></div><div>My current dilemma is with social media. Twitter, Instagram, Ask FM, etc. Stevie is a VERY popular kid. People love him. He has a very magnetic personality so he has a lot of people &quot;following.&quot; &quot;retweeting&quot; and &quot;sharing&quot; his posts and pictures. Stevie is also VERY 14 and he has always enjoyed a bit of the shocking (think Daniel Tosh) and risky. My 18 year old (very modest) daughter, my husband and I all follow him. Chelsea (his sister) thinks I should censor about 80% of his posts! I ask him to pull down around 5% of what I see. We talk about why and he rarely agrees with me but doesn&#39;t fight pulling it down. This stuff is out there forever. Even the stuff he pulls down is already reposted. I don&#39;t envy kids right now as I was also VERY 14! If this technology was around then I expect my trail wouldn&#39;t be so pretty!</div>
<div><br></div><div>My husband is far more relaxed about this than I am. By the way, he is very supportive about unschooling and reads Pam&#39;s intro emails little by little as I send them. He&#39;s actually doing the &quot;read a little&quot; part as advised!</div>
<div><br></div><div>Does anyone have any insight on what I could do to continue moving towards radical unschooling? I understand it so well that I am very hungry for it in its fullness. Oh if understanding concepts were as valuable as really getting it!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2064213212"><div dir="ltr">It really isn&#39;t threats or anything in anger. The stuff he and his friends say are I guess what you would call sexually explicit joking and swearing. They think they are funny and I guess a lot of their teen friends agree. It really isn&#39;t far from the stuff my friends and I said at that age but we were not sharing it with the world. He likes explicit rap music and we have a lot of conversations about what they are talking about but Stevie is a musician and he loves the beats and the word play. I realize that when I was a kid people blamed suicides and all other evils on my music and I won&#39;t do the same even though I find it distasteful. I do see the language leaking into his language though and I think it is yucky. My opinion doesn&#39;t sway him away though. He is getting better at choosing which rap songs to share with me and I am becoming more open and learning and talking about different rappers and even finding the ones I liker most. It is really hard for me to enjoy though and I can&#39;t hide that I don&#39;t like it. I am a bit of a rock and roll snob but I&#39;m working on it. &nbsp;</div>

I realize looking back that I lumped it in with the value he puts on shocking with words. It didn&#39;t belong.</font></div>

I was just stating that if I ask him he will usually say okay. We don&#39;t ban him from the internet or ground him. I have never seen that stuff as effective anyway.
