&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; Is it possible to lead a horse to unschooling?&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; If you advertise &quot;WATER&quot; in a way horses can understand, it needs <br/>
&gt; to be <br/>
&gt; &gt; useable water in a form they can access.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I suppose in the end (I know I am flogging that poor horse metaphor) <br/>
&gt; if the horse is thirsty enough and the water potable he/she will <br/>
&gt; drink.  The real question, I suppose is whether he/she will notice <br/>
&gt; the oily sheen on the top of the water refracting the light into <br/>
&gt; rainbows, or the bugs walking ever so delicately on the surface <br/>
&gt; tension,, or the little plant growing just under the place where the <br/>
&gt; water has managed to rust through and slowly drips out, or the way <br/>
&gt; the welding was done on the trough, or how if his/her nose is under <br/>
&gt; the water when he/she exhales bubbles are made, or the bird flying <br/>
&gt; overhead and the cool way its poop drifts down, faster than it looks <br/>
&gt; like it should, but still responding to the wind.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The problem with unschooling is that it isn&#39;t a means to an end.  If <br/>
&gt; you unschool you aren&#39;t doing it so that your children will read and <br/>
&gt; write.  You aren&#39;t doing it so that they will eventually learn to <br/>
&gt; turn off the television on their own.  You are doing it because the <br/>
&gt; process is more important than the end.  Or because unschooling is <br/>
&gt; the end and the beginning and the whole shebang.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And I don&#39;t know how it is possible to prevent people from believing <br/>
&gt; that unschooling is a means to an end.  <br/>
