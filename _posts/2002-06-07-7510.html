Nintendo.  There&#39;s one for Playstation they don&#39;t have, but they have it for <br/>
Super Nintendo, 64 and gameboy, I think.</div>

<br/>
<br/>
The N64 update of the cult culturation classic is one of the most charming <br/>
entertainments of the year. <br/>
<br/>
When Harvest Moon premiered on the Super NES in 1997, many gamers turned up <br/>
their collective noses at the idea of an RPG game based on operating a farm. <br/>
But even in the shadow of the revolutionary N64 this down-home Pak whipped up <br/>
quite a stir and a loyal following of dedicated virtual farmers! <br/>
<br/>
If you missed the fun of Harvest Moon for Super NES, you owe yourself a shot <br/>
at the good life on Nintendo 64. The new edition is based on the same premise <br/>
as the original: grandpa leaves you alone on his run-down farm, and your goal <br/>
is to turn it into a successful enterprise, find a wife, and live happily <br/>
ever after. As in real life, this is easier said than done.<br/>
<br/>
After some unusual customization choices (you get to name your character, dog <br/>
and farm and pick your birthday!), friendly characters gently school you in <br/>
the rudiments of rustic life. Should you forget anything, the game offers an <br/>
extensive series of tutorials. <br/>
<br/>
Clearing the land, amending the soil and planting and nurturing crops takes <br/>
up much of the early part of the game. As you prosper, you&#39;ll want to buy and <br/>
care for sheep, chickens and cows. You&#39;ll even get a gift horse. Just be sure <br/>
not to look it in the mouth! <br/>
<br/>
All work and no play makes for a dull farmer, so make frequent tracks for <br/>
nearby Flower Bud Village. Besides stocking up on seed, tools and fortifying <br/>
foodstuffs, the village is populated with five young women intrigued by an <br/>
ambitious chap like you. Elli, Maria, Popuri, Karen and Ann are an extremely <br/>
well-bred lot, so you&#39;ll have to work as hard on your wooing as you do on <br/>
your turnip crop. <br/>
<br/>
Indeed, the villagers enjoy quite a busy social calendar. There are more than <br/>
a dozen activities throughout the year, beginning with the Planting Festival <br/>
in the spring and concluding with a New Year&#39;s bash. In between there is a <br/>
Firefly Festival, a Harvest Festival, two horse races and Thanksgiving, plus <br/>
ample opportunities to upgrade Flower Bud&#39;s infrastructure by repairing a <br/>
bridge and opening the Mountain Spring. <br/>
<br/>
You can grow seven different crops, ranging from the humble turnip to the <br/>
highly lucrative strawberry. But once in a while you&#39;ll want to wander off <br/>
the old homestead. The hills and woods roundabouts are alive with mushrooms, <br/>
grapes, medicinal herbs and even more bizarre botanical specimens. Fish <br/>
nibble in a nearby pond. In winter, you can keep the cash coming in by mining <br/>
for precious minerals. <br/>
<br/>
By and large this is a fairly faithful sim of rural life that&#39;s punctuated by <br/>
some extremely fanciful excursions. A nearby cave is the home of an elf who, <br/>
for some mysterious reason, speaks pig latin. A seldom-seen nymph cavorts in <br/>
a pond and a Moonlight Stone lies buried deep beneath the earth. Small <br/>
wonder, then, that the villagers dedicate a year-ending festival to scaring <br/>
away troublemaking ghosts! <br/>
<br/>
Harvest Moon 64 scores your accomplishments after two years. Like farming <br/>
itself, though, this open-ended Pak encourages you to keep on playing, year <br/>
after year. You&#39;ll keep digging up well-buried nuggets of fun, like a recipe <br/>
for &quot;Steamed Clams with Wine&quot;! <br/>
<br/>
This unusually tranquil RPG is an exceedingly pleasant diversion. Our main <br/>
beef is that female RPG fans -- and they are legion -- might be miffed by <br/>
having to play as a male character.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-92933169">I was really surprised how long my boys played this game too.  It seems to<br/>
be something they will go back to every now and again too.<br/>
<br/>
A similar style game for the PC is &quot;The Sims&quot;.  You build homes for your<br/>
people, find jobs, etc.<br/>
