<div id="ygrps-yiv-965938702">Rebecca in British Columbia wrote this in response to questions about  <br/>
unschooling on a blog.   It&#39;s clear and concise, and if I can get a  <br/>
last name to go with this, I&#39;d love to save it on my site under  <br/>
principles, please!<br/>
<br/>
---------------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Crunchy Chicken also asks:<br/>
&quot;The families that GMA covers do radical unschooling which extends  <br/>
their unschooling ideas to their parenting and they have no rules. Is  <br/>
this common?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There is a difference between rules (which are very black and white,  <br/>
not very flexible) and principles (which are all encompassing and  <br/>
provide opportunities for dialogue). I would say that many  <br/>
&quot;mainstream&quot; parents also use something like principles for raising  <br/>
their children. &quot;Rules&quot; are what &quot;Brick Wall&quot; parents (a Barbara  <br/>
Coloroso term) stick to when they are dealing with their kids. It&#39;s  <br/>
the &quot;my way or the highway&quot; approach to parenting and tends to be  <br/>
absolute, resulting in punishment or &quot;consequences&quot; for relatively  <br/>
minor misdemeanors. Other parents have &quot;rules&quot; but really use them as  <br/>
guidelines for their children&#39;s behaviour rather than opportunities to  <br/>
be authoritarian or punitive. They may think &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;logical&quot;  <br/>
consequences are a fair way to deal with a child&#39;s behaviour, not  <br/>
realizing that those are often punitive in their own right. eg) a  <br/>
child forgets his lunch and goes hungry as a result... a &quot;natural&quot;  <br/>
consequence; or a child leaves his Lego on the floor for a week, so it  <br/>
gets piled in a bag and put on the top shelf in the closet ... a  <br/>
&quot;logical&quot; consequence that takes away something the child cares deeply  <br/>
about.<br/>
<br/>
Radical unschooling takes discipline to a different level with  <br/>
principles. Principles guide the interactions within the family. They  <br/>
help to provide a compass for behaviour... for all family members. But  <br/>
unschooling parents also realize that when a child&#39;s behaviour is  <br/>
difficult to live with, it may be because the child is trying to  <br/>
communicate something they can&#39;t put into words. Unschooling parents  <br/>
take the time to get to the root of the problem rather than punishing  <br/>
a child or isolating a child through time out. It&#39;s a compassionate  <br/>
approach to &quot;discipline&quot; that doesn&#39;t mean that &quot;anything goes&quot;. It  <br/>
simply means that children are treated respectfully, gently, and with  <br/>
kindness at all times.</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Those words are sweet, but mostly too vague for conveying what radical <br/>
unschoolers do that is different than any other respectul, gentle, and <br/>
kind parents.<br/>
<br/>
Conventional parents usually don&#39;t think they are being disrespectful or <br/>
unkind, and they often think they are using only gentle punishments, <br/>
referred to as &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;logical&quot; consequences.<br/>
<br/>
What do radical unschoolers do that is different?<br/>
<br/>
First,  it is &quot;Parenting with Interpersonal Intelligence.&quot; I think it is <br/>
all about having a clear idea in our own heads, as parents, of what our <br/>
interactions with our children mean TO THEM, from their point of view.<br/>
<br/>
Parents send their kids to their room to, &quot;Think it over,&quot; or give them <br/>
some kind of punishment to get them to, &quot;Think about what you did.&quot; But <br/>
what are the kids most likely thinking? &quot;She&#39;s so mean.&quot; &quot;She doesn&#39;t <br/>
understand.&quot; &quot;She&#39;s not fair.&quot; &quot;She didn&#39;t listen to me.&quot; &quot;She doesn&#39;t <br/>
care.&quot; &quot;I HATE her.&quot; &quot;I&#39;ll never treat MY children like this.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When we are more able to think from our kids&#39; point of view, we are more <br/>
able to figure out what we can do that will really help a situation. It <br/>
makes a huge difference in what choices we make, as parents.<br/>
<br/>
Second - most people are completely and totally and thoroughly <br/>
brainwashed by the whole Skinnerian behaviorist approach to &quot;training&quot; <br/>
children. When a child is, for example, lashing out at a sibling, that <br/>
is a child who needs a parent to help him work through some kind of <br/>
problem. But most parents think that any show of sympathy will be <br/>
perceived as a reward by the child for his misbehavior and will <br/>
condition him to do more and more of it.<br/>
<br/>
It is very hard to get out of that mindset - but children are not circus <br/>
animals, to be trained with reward and punishment.  Unschoolers drop <br/>
that &quot;trained animal&quot; paradigm - and that is a HUGE huge gigantic big <br/>
change that requires us to re-examine every aspect of parenting - and to <br/>
treat our children like real human beings, with complex needs and <br/>
interests.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;d actually run out of room in the comment. I&#39;d used up all my characters and was trying to keep things short. As well as sweet. :)<br/>
<br/>
I had thought about commenting on my comment but didn&#39;t want to wear out my welcome. Your words here help me clarify my thinking.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Conventional parents usually don&#39;t think they are being disrespectful or <br/>
&gt; unkind, and they often think they are using only gentle punishments, <br/>
&gt; referred to as &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;logical&quot; consequences.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I revised it a teeny bit for my own blog and made sure that this part read as:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Other parents have &quot;rules&quot; but really use them as guidelines for their children&#39;s behaviour rather than opportunities to be authoritarian or punitive. They may, however, think &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;logical&quot; consequences are a fair way to deal with a child&#39;s behaviour, not realizing that those are often punitive in their own right. eg) a child forgets his lunch and goes hungry as a result... a &quot;natural&quot; consequence; or a child leaves his Lego on the floor for a week, so it gets piled in a bag and put on the top shelf in the closet ... a &quot;logical&quot; consequence that takes away something the child cares deeply about.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That &quot;however&quot; I added in front of natural and logical consequences seems small but it really needed to be there the first time around. Most parents simply don&#39;t understand that there are choices. Their intentions are good but fall short because they read the conventional parenting material that is most readily available, not realizing that it&#39;s just a variation on a theme (punitive).<br/>
<br/>
After I graduated with my first degree, I worked in a behavioural residential program. There was even a token economy and it was &quot;lock-up&quot;. The &quot;clientele&quot; were mostly street kids who were there by court order (at high risk for harming themselves or others) and did not respond well to the &quot;point system&quot;. Some of the child care workers were stuck on the point card (very behavioural), giving points for conforming to the rules and taking away points for asserting independence, and the kids hated them (the workers). Other child care workers stuck the point card in their back pocket for the shift and gave a lump sum at the end of the day. These were the workers that the kids loved and responded to. Not because of the lump sum (which they got to spend in the &quot;store&quot;). Because of the relationship because that is how these folks worked with the kids (and I learned a great deal from them). <br/>
<br/>
That is the piece that I really wanted to add in there. It&#39;s all about relationship. That&#39;s what principles support. Not good behaviour. Good, solid, loving, unconditional relationships. When relationships are in order, the behaviour follows because people feel supported, understood, valued, and the list goes on.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think it is <br/>
&gt; all about having a clear idea in our own heads, as parents, of what our <br/>
&gt; interactions with our children mean TO THEM, from their point of view.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do think there are people out there who aren&#39;t unschoolers who parent this way or who want to parent this way. However, they break trust with their children every single day they send them to school. When I was a school counsellor (a couple of degrees and several years later), I spent a good deal of my time (when not dealing with &quot;behaviour problems&quot;) helping children and parents with school refusal. I often recommended homeschooling (to the chagrin of my principals) when a child was so clearly devastated by the separation with the parent. The parents were so relieved that someone didn&#39;t think it was a problem that their child didn&#39;t want to separate (they had been blamed so often for being too enmeshed) - they didn&#39;t want to either but thought they &quot;had to&quot; (another bi-product of going through the school system ourselves). <br/>
<br/>
The difference is that radical unschoolers have examined their own &quot;schooled&quot; perspectives, deschooled their thinking (about learning and about relationships) and have moved into an integrated living/learning lifestyle with their children. I was going to use the word &quot;integrity&quot; but scared myself a little. However, I think that&#39;s true. It is about integrity in that we live our beliefs  in all areas of our lives.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; When we are more able to think from our kids&#39; point of view, we are more <br/>
&gt; able to figure out what we can do that will really help a situation. It <br/>
&gt; makes a huge difference in what choices we make, as parents.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes... seeing things through the eyes of our child. True empathy. Those things need to be  in there as well.<br/>
<br/>
It was what I meant to be heading toward when I spoke of &quot;getting to the root of the problem&quot; rather than just seeing is as problem behaviour.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But most parents think that any show of sympathy will be <br/>
&gt; perceived as a reward by the child for his misbehavior and will <br/>
&gt; condition him to do more and more of it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know! And how far from the truth! <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I wish someone had locked Skinner in his own box for an afternoon. Behaviourism set our whole society back several paces when people started to apply the theories to real live children (and adults) without accounting for the complexity of being human.<br/>
<br/>
I do think things are shifting. This afternoon I was reflecting on how the trend toward attachment parenting (and all that entails) may be setting the stage for more people to be drawn toward unschooling and that this may mean that they actually &quot;get it&quot; sooner than people have in the past. I have no idea if that&#39;s true, but I think it might be nice it was.<br/>
