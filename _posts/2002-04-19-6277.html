&gt; playing the computer.  They are addicted to &quot;The Sims&quot;.  It is a very<br/>
&gt; mentally stimulating game but prevents exposure to other things.  It<br/>
&gt; seems like as soon as I am done introducing them to something, they<br/>
&gt; go back to playing on the computer.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Two of my kids (14 and 11) got a new SIMS expansion pack last night (they <br/>
split the cost) - I left them home all day today while I went off to the <br/>
ceramics studio. I called them every couple of hours - they played, happily <br/>
and TOGETHER, all day. They&#39;ll be obsessed with it for a while - that&#39;s okay, <br/>
it is very very cool and I don&#39;t blame them. But it won&#39;t last forever. After <br/>
a few weeks they&#39;ll still be into it - but not to play it for hours a day. <br/>
And, we go out of the house enough that they do take time off &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
The new one is SIMS Vacation and on sale at Best Buy for $29 plus there is a <br/>
$10 Best Buy Gift Card you get by mail. Just fyi &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
