-=- I tried to find a computer place he could volunteer at but he&#39;s to young <br/>
for that too. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Why would you feel better if he were volunteering at &quot;a computer place&quot; <br/>
rather than choosing to use the computer the way he wants to?   (And an X-Box and <br/>
the games people are playing on X-Box live qualify as computer for certain.)<br/>
<br/>
-=- I must admit because of his age I&#39;m starting to panic especially when <br/>
people ask what he&#39;s doing school wise this year!!-=-<br/>
<br/>
How long have you unschooled?<br/>
What would you be saying about what he&#39;s doing &quot;schoolwise&quot; if he were NOT <br/>
playing X-Box?<br/>
Can&#39;t your answer be &quot;We don&#39;t use a curriculum; we learn from all kinds of <br/>
things.   He&#39;s been playing a lot of [whatever game]; have you played it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=- I don&#39;t want to turn into the nagging, yelling, freaked out mom.-=-<br/>
<br/>
That wouldn&#39;t help anything at all.<br/>
<br/>
So what have you been doing lately?   What have you been learning?   What&#39;s <br/>
new with you?<br/>
<br/>
-=-He only comes out of his room to eat or go to the bathroom.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Do you ever take food to him in there and sit and watch him play?<br/>
I&#39;ve done that many times.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-484522629">So with the Xbox live do they actually have voice communication with <br/>
each other? What&#39;s the youngest the games go for that?<br/>
 Also do any of you have kids who talk with other kids using Skype? <br/>
One of those free computer to computer phone things? I would be more <br/>
relaxed if I son could talk with other kids more often. He&#39;s a 7yo <br/>
only and he rarely plays with any other kids, and even rarer that he <br/>
gets to play with another unschooled child and most of the schooled <br/>
ones he talks to have been rather bullish. He doesn&#39;t write/type quite <br/>
well enough yet to do a chat room yet but he does like to talk on the <br/>
phone. Barbara</div>

 </span></blockquote>Barbara, it has been great for my guy for social stuff. There is lots of<br/>
laughter and interchange. There is also &quot;bully&quot; kind of talk, swearing and<br/>
name-calling, etc. He seems to move through that well too, and we talk a<br/>
whole lot about it. There are other younger children you son&#39;s age playing.<br/>
