<div id="ygrps-yiv-1015466124"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;An awareness of each person&#39;s preferences and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>limitations can &gt;be surfed without putting up<br/>
signposts about it.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Sandra<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can see here where this idea above would be a<br/>
difficulty for those with autism or austistic like<br/>
developmental differences.  I&#39;m having trouble<br/>
articulating this so forgive me if this doesn&#39;t come<br/>
out right.  We DO often need the labels or signopsts<br/>
for understanding sometimes.  Thinking in greys and<br/>
abstracts doesn&#39;t come easily.  Everything is<br/>
specifically defined, to minute detail like the koala<br/>
with his leaves, and needs to be specifically defined<br/>
for understanding.  <br/>
<br/>
For instance learning facial recognition of what<br/>
&quot;angry&quot; looks like often doesn&#39;t translate to<br/>
different people.  &quot;OK, now I know and have catalogued<br/>
what Jane&#39;s angry face looks like for future reference<br/>
in interacting with Jane.  I don&#39;t know what Barry or<br/>
Bill or Betty&#39;s angry faces look like though.  I will<br/>
have to learn this in order to porperly interact with<br/>
them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
These specifics are present in everything.  A<br/>
sensativity above and beyond most people&#39;s<br/>
sensativities and distinctions to things like sensory,<br/>
emotional or other input.  For me most movies feel<br/>
like they are beating me about the head and bosy with<br/>
emotion.  Understated is best and gives me as much of<br/>
an emotional punch impact as something more heavy<br/>
handed for other folks.  I can&#39;t watch most of mel<br/>
Gibson&#39;s stuff (Braveheart, Passion of Christ,<br/>
Partiot) because it&#39;s just far, far too strong for me<br/>
and I am not only sobbing or very disturbed just a<br/>
short way into the film but am also emotionally<br/>
disturbed, off balance, nightmaring, etc, for days or<br/>
weeks afterwards, with amorphous non-specific panic<br/>
and anxiety when awake.  That&#39;s not entertaining or<br/>
fun by any stretch of the imagination, no matter how<br/>
gifted an actor/director he might be.<br/>
<br/>
Ironically this inability to turn off or tone down<br/>
sensory or emotional inputs is coupled with an<br/>
inability to see or dectect subtleties in other areas.<br/>
 It&#39;s often contradicotry, unpredictable and<br/>
frustrating.<br/>
<br/>
So in that way there are almost no &quot;generalizations&quot;<br/>
happening at all inside autistics, even in something<br/>
as common as reading emotion on different faces.  This<br/>
makes navigating something like the party example you<br/>
used really hard, coupled with the overstimulation.  I<br/>
imagined myself in your place, trying to watch my<br/>
husband for signs of discomfort and his needing to<br/>
leave and I could not imagine being able to do that. <br/>
I can&#39;t even hear him talking to me when the kids are<br/>
playing in the room at a normal kid volume, and have<br/>
to either ask them to be quiet for a minute or leave<br/>
the room with him myself in order to hear what he&#39;s<br/>
saying.  I can&#39;t imagine remembering and enacting a<br/>
reading of his face during a busy social gathering.  I<br/>
can&#39;t imagine him being able to do something like that<br/>
either.  Instead what we do is have a tacit agreement<br/>
in our family to say outright what we need to the<br/>
other person(s).  In fact he asked me to do this when<br/>
we were first starting to date and I was relieved that<br/>
he had the same problems I do in that area and so<br/>
understood me better for it.  So if he was feeling<br/>
tired and needing to go he would pull me aside and let<br/>
me know.  Same with our kids, or myself to them,<br/>
although we do try to watch the kids more and let them<br/>
know what they seem to be expressing because they<br/>
don&#39;t recognize or understand their own feelings or<br/>
needs often.<br/>
