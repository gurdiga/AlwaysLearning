<div id="ygrps-yiv-1746754652">=Also, there are games where people can play as a good guy or a bad guy, and<br/>
that might appeal to him, and he would be &quot;playing right&quot; to do that.<br/>
Knights of the Old Republic is the only one I can name at 4:00 in the<br/>
morning with Marty asleep. :-) I think there&#39;s a name for that genre or<br/>
aspect of the game to. Something about morality?=<br/>
<br/>
Star Wars Forced Unleashed II is coming to my mind.  Austin played through<br/>
as a good guy and then played through as a bad guy to see what would<br/>
happen.  There is also a Spiderman game (Web of Shadows) where if Spiderman<br/>
does too many disrupting things, like breaking windows or throwing cars, he<br/>
will turn into black Spiderman and everyone will run away from him.  In<br/>
Assassin&#39;s Creed if Ezio kills a civilian or is busted pick pocketing his<br/>
notoriety goes up and it becomes harder to complete his mission.<br/>
<br/>
Those are just some examples of games where you can experiment with being a<br/>
good guy and a bad guy that have been played here (Austin is 9).  Doing good<br/>
things vs. bad things, where the game will consider your actions and your<br/>
character will change accordingly.  There is an alignment system.<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, we didn&#39;t know this at first, but you can turn off the blood<br/>
in Assassin&#39;s Creed which might make it a little more tolerable for kids who<br/>
are sensitive to that.  This is Austin&#39;s most favorite game and we would<br/>
have missed out on all the awesomeness the game has brought into our house<br/>
if we hadn&#39;t figured out that the blood could be turned off.<br/>
