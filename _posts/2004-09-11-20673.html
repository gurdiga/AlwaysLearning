<div id="ygrps-yiv-2006603676">Hi Katy -<br/>
Often the 1st few times I encounter a situation, I feel frozen and unable to <br/>
respond.  After thinking about it, I feel more ready to try something <br/>
different (than nothing) the next time.<br/>
<br/>
Something that has been meaningful to me has been trying to connect with <br/>
mothers who are in that harried, scared(?), frustrated, overwhelmed state by <br/>
offering empathy and assistance.  I try to connecting with the mother&#39;s frustration <br/>
and then the children&#39;s experience.  I try to offer assistance and be <br/>
friendly to the mother and child.  Sometimes I simply interrupt the anger and ask for <br/>
the time, directions, or whatever and then strike up a conversation to <br/>
hopefully turn things around.  Sometimes, I throw in a comment like &#39;spanking <br/>
doesn&#39;t help anything in the long run but sometimes it can be hard to think of <br/>
something else when we feel so frustrated!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I have found exchanges like this to be meaningful to my children, too, in <br/>
that they are aware of the compassionate response.  That&#39;s impt to me bec. I <br/>
often resort to judgment.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I think the situation you described is different than what Sandra <br/>
described.  I think I more easily connect with the &#39;harried/frustrated&#39;.  I&#39;ll have <br/>
to look at that more for myself.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, aside from the debate about spanking, I believe that &#39;hurt people <br/>
hurt people&quot; so when someone wants to hurt another, it speaks to their own <br/>
issues.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>
Jane<br/>
