<div id="ygrps-yiv-996909389">My 13 year old son has been choosing to attend a Montessori school <br/>
for the past 2 years.  We used to HOMESCHOOL.  He chose school for <br/>
more social activity--in retrospect, I did allow the birth of 2 <br/>
other children and the nursing and needs of these children to leave <br/>
me not making the same outgoing efforts to find the excessive social <br/>
outings he craved.  That said, school has been very stressful for <br/>
him.  The homework seems to have been the straw that broke his back, <br/>
as it came to such a head this year, we finally sat last week and <br/>
decided enough is enough--get out before it kills you (and uS!!:))<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sawyer has been kind of angry, not wanting to interact with his 8 <br/>
and 5 year old brothers and has been downright hostile and nasty <br/>
toward them with no provacation, not really wanting to hang out with <br/>
us, not wanting to talk nicely, nor be compliant with any part of <br/>
the &quot;family&quot; doings.  (Like if we planned an outing to the beach, <br/>
which we ALL love, he would turn it into a nightmare).<br/>
<br/>
Now, he has only been out of school 1 full week, but holy cow!  He <br/>
is hugging us--smiling, playing with his brothers, hanging out in <br/>
the kitchen, asking questions, went to the LIBRARY with me--wants to <br/>
cook every Wednesday night....is answering nicely, asking nicely, <br/>
looks different altogether--body posture etc.<br/>
<br/>
I have been astounded, and now have to say that by Golly--it is the <br/>
stress that caused a lot of that previous behavior.  It had nothing <br/>
to do with being 12-13.  It wasn&#39;t some other excuse about too much <br/>
food, too little, too little sleep..too many WOW hours......all the <br/>
things I kept looking for and trying to help him out with .<br/>
<br/>
He wants to continue with some kind of &quot;school&quot; work, which we&#39;re <br/>
discussing, but I have just kind of tossed it in his lap as to WHAT, <br/>
and then am helping him find the info.  MY point--not to digress- is <br/>
that the effects of stress are far beyond what I already knew.  The <br/>
transformation of this child--what occurred in the beginning of him <br/>
going to school--though very slowly and not as noticable to link---<br/>
to the stripping of this shell of resistance to all things good--is <br/>
remarkable.  And of course makes me sad that I waited and didn&#39;t <br/>
pull him out earlier--but that was not HIS choice at the time.  We <br/>
just kept talking about the pros and cons, and I pointed out the <br/>
detriments as I saw them, and kept asking him to consider all things <br/>
with his life choices.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, my efforts will be 110% for finding him what HE needs now.  <br/>
And there will BE NO MORE HOMESCHOOLING IN THIS HOUSE!!!!!!!!!!!</div>
