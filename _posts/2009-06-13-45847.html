<div id="ygrps-yiv-1887815915">Hi all, this is my first post and sorry up front for the novella. I have<br/>
been observing for a couple months now. I am not going to classify myself as<br/>
a RU... just a mom who sees many benefits of adding unschooling philosophy<br/>
to our current ideas on attached, respectful parenting. It is the ideas as<br/>
it pertains to the whole family dynamic that appeal to me since my two<br/>
school age kids are in public school, their choice. My son (almost 9) did<br/>
come home for about 7 months but found being home &quot;too boring&quot; and went back<br/>
to school.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This post is about him. It has been one of those days when I am so<br/>
discouraged I just want to roll up into a ball and stay like that for days.<br/>
I have three kids, 3, 5, and 8. My 8 year son is so challenging I am at my<br/>
wit&#39;s end.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
He was pretty much raised in a very attached home. I breastfed, he co-slept<br/>
from the beginning, he was carried every waking moment or he would scream,<br/>
and he has been raised with very few arbitrary rules. I did have to work<br/>
outside the home until he was almost 4 though. :-( I was raised in a very<br/>
verbally and sometime physically abusive environment so I am not saying that<br/>
I have been the perfect peaceful parent. I have a temper. But from the<br/>
beginning I knew I wanted to raise my kids differently then I was and that<br/>
meant no barrage of stupid rules or smothering my kids with endless<br/>
expectations.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The problem is that my son is verbally and physically abusive to me and his<br/>
siblings. He treats virtually no one with respect even though that is not<br/>
the way he is treated. It is starting to rub off on my two other kids as<br/>
they learn to handle things the way my oldest does. badly!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Just a few for instance scenarios from today: My oldest was mad that his<br/>
three year old brother went into the room they are SUPPOSED to share and got<br/>
into his crafting supplies. Never mind the fact that the 3 year old gets<br/>
ousted from his own room I have suggested numerous times that if he does not<br/>
want his brother to go in there all he needs to do is shut the door, since<br/>
baby brother cannot open it. He almost never shuts the door though and in<br/>
fact almost never shuts the doors to the house which has resulted in his<br/>
brother running outside and into the street. So. his brother messed with his<br/>
stuff. He responded by running out of the room and punching his brother in<br/>
the back and saying &quot;he deserved it!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I talked to him about it and couldn&#39;t get him to see that he can&#39;t hit his<br/>
siblings. He insists that if they do this or that then he WILL hit them. He<br/>
tells me matter-o-factly that THIS is the way it is!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Today as we were leaving his grandmother&#39;s house for a visit he was mad that<br/>
a puzzle she bought had to stay at her home. So he threw it across the room<br/>
in a rage. I stood by the door and told him we would leave after he picked<br/>
up the puzzle pieces and put it away. He spent a few minutes throwing it<br/>
around some more and then realized I was serious and eventually picked it<br/>
up. He was so furious about having to pick up the mess he made that he<br/>
walked out the door smacking a Snapple bottle on the side of the house until<br/>
it broke and squirted tea all over him. My 5 year daughter laughed and so he<br/>
assaulted her and started hitting her saying that she laughed so she<br/>
&quot;deserves this&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
All the way he home he fought with his siblings, often deliberately doing<br/>
things to provoke them and then lying about it. A couple times he hit me in<br/>
the head while I was driving with something from the back seat. By the time<br/>
we got home I had it and sent him to his room.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t seem to know how to deal with anger and he could not handle being<br/>
made to clean up after his own tantrum so it turned into a 2 hour session of<br/>
torturing to get back at us.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
He has zero friends because truthfully no one can stand him for long. He<br/>
ends up getting bullied at school because he has rather bizarre behavior,<br/>
clucking like chicken, shrill screams for no reason, clapping loudly in<br/>
people&#39;s faces, etc. I assume they are tics of some sort and have often felt<br/>
he has some high functioning autism characteristics.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We just moved into a new house and he made a new friend that lasted for all<br/>
of 3 days until the parents of the child ordered my son to go away and stay<br/>
away.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday the father came to my door banging loudly and when I opened it he<br/>
yelled at me to keep my &quot;KID&quot; off his property. Apparently he sits on his<br/>
bike in front of their property or in their driveway, probably hoping the<br/>
child will come out. When I told my son that the man came over, he assumed<br/>
it was a different neighbor from a completely different street! So he has<br/>
already got two families in our new neighborhood mad at us. And<br/>
unfortunately for my daughter she is also not allowed to play at the<br/>
neighbor&#39;s house because of my son, so he is ruining her friendships too.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This morning I caught him yelling at the paper boy to get off our property.<br/>
He does not seem to realize or care that this behavior is the reason why he<br/>
has no friends.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
He is also not doing so well adjusting to a new economic situation. My<br/>
husband who was absent for most of his formative years cause he was a truck<br/>
driver is now home. We decided to do with less money so he could be home all<br/>
the time. This means that all the kids have to do with less. We don&#39;t live<br/>
in as a nice a house, we don&#39;t give them as many toys and gifts, we don&#39;t<br/>
vacation as much and we used to do a lot. But the finances as well as the<br/>
fact that my son doesn&#39;t respect or care for any of his possessions is<br/>
wearing thin on us. He has trashed 4 bikes and gone through 4-5 DVD players<br/>
in the past 2 years. I don&#39;t think a day goes by when we don&#39;t have at least<br/>
1 tantrum about having to say no to some request that involves us spending<br/>
quite a bit of money on him. new rollerblades to replace the ones he left<br/>
outside to get ruined, a visit to the water park, a trip to the batting<br/>
cages. He has expensive tastes and we cannot fulfill his requests. When we<br/>
do it is not good enough. I got season passes to the zoo and he will throw a<br/>
fit about not being able to ride the amusement park rides at the theme park<br/>
next door or throw a fit if I only stay 4 hours and he doesn&#39;t get to see<br/>
every single exhibit. I just feel like nothing we do for him is enough. He<br/>
is always unhappy and angry. saying life is unfair, we are unfair, and they<br/>
we are bad parents. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I also want to note that he has TONS of freedom. He has no bedtime, chores,<br/>
or even any rules beyond don&#39;t hurt anyone or their property. He spends most<br/>
of his days out on his bike riding around and playing. by himself. I only<br/>
ask that he not go too far away and make me have to mount a search party to<br/>
find him. and he usually abides that. In his room he has a 50 inch TV,<br/>
cable, two video game consoles, a Nintendo DS, and hundreds of DVDs. He has<br/>
no limits on any of it. time or content. So our struggles have nothing to do<br/>
with his rebelling against all our unfair rules because there really aren&#39;t<br/>
any. If anything he is rebelling against the only real limitations we have<br/>
which are in regards to people and property.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, his behavior is getting so stressful that it has me feeling like a<br/>
failure as a parent. I also feel I spend so much time trying to protect my<br/>
other kids from him and counteract the negative example he leaves for them.<br/>
My daughter is in constant reaction mode. just waiting for him to do<br/>
something to her or one of her belongings. I want to cry when I hear my 3<br/>
year old saying &quot;stop. your hurting me!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t know what to do anymore. when I look at my two younger kids I would<br/>
say that attachment parenting, peaceful & respectful parenting, and<br/>
unschooling are doing wondrous things. I cannot say the same when I look at<br/>
my oldest.. I just wonder what the heck I am doing wrong.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
As I write this he just came up to me screaming and demanding to know why I<br/>
was in his room messing with his TV and turning the channel. I told him that<br/>
I have not been in his room and he screams &quot;LIAR!&quot; at me and runs out of the<br/>
house.. Sigh. This is the norm with him.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I am really looking for some advice here. don&#39;t be afraid to hurt my<br/>
feelings if I am screwing it all up. I need to find peace for my son for all<br/>
our sakes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1004766147">When he was home, what did he do?  Did<br/>
you do stuff with him, or was he just sort<br/>
of at loose ends?  I wonder why he<br/>
felt so bored at home that he prefered<br/>
going (returing?) to school?<br/>
<br/>
I have children who prefers negative<br/>
attention to no attention. If I am not<br/>
giving a particular child enough<br/>
attention--and it can be challenging, as I have<br/>
five pretty close in age to one another--, then <br/>
there are going to be tantrums and hitting and breaking <br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
Then I know the problem is I am not paying<br/>
enough attention to each child individually.<br/>
Everybody in the family wants one-on-one time<br/>
with mom, and with dad, too.  Doing things<br/>
all together is great, but we need to have individual,<br/>
distinct relationships and private time with one<br/>
another, too.<br/>
<br/>
I may very well be misreading the situation, but could<br/>
your child be crying out for your attention, in his<br/>
own way?<br/>
<br/>
Not saying that is the problem in your family;<br/>
just saying that when one of my kids is sad<br/>
and &quot;acting out&quot; I can calm the whole house <br/>
down by focusing positively on that kid, spending<br/>
time with my child, doing stuff that child likes<br/>
to do, and being attentive and respectful.<br/>
<br/>
HTH, YMMV, take it with a grain of salt...<br/>
... I&#39;m new here, too!<br/>

my family is a blended family of two bio and<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2069657480">Hi, <br/>
I just have a short tip to give you that you may check out if you feel that it may have any relevance to your sons situation. I sincerely belive that all children are intelligent, loving persons that will do the best they can within the situation they are in. Our children have many needs that we as parents needs to see to, and one that we usually don´t think so much about is the nutritional needs. Of course we feed them, but the right information about childrens actual nutritional needs is not easy to come by. The big food industri and certinely the pharmaceutical industry have no interest in our childrens wellbeeing, they care about profit. And it still amazes me (after spending a couple of years serching about it)just how much of the &quot;information&quot; about our childrens dietary needs from doctors, schools and other supposedly &quot;neutral&quot; institutions that are funded by theese two major industries. I did my own research and found that our standard diet is very deficient in some important nutrition, mainly the fatsoluble vitamins A, D and E wich are crucial for our brain and nervous system. I live in Sweden and India (please excuse my sometimes crappy english), but the modern diet here is not much different from the standard American one. The addition of theese vitamins to childrens diet (in its natural form, synthetic vitamin pills will not do) have proven miracluos to childrens mental and fysical wellbeeing. My son was four years when I started to give him foods rich in fatsoluble vitamins and he is not a sunshine all the time (then I would be worried!) but he has no tantrums or unreasonable angerattacs anymore. He is a focused and healthy boy now, and it is because his nutritional needs are fulfilled for the first time in his life. I highly recommend to check out www.westonaprice.org and www.healingourchildren.net for more information. Those websites have given me a ton of info that I think everybody needs to read. Good luck to you and your family!<br/>
Sincerely, Karin<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-425511849">first of all, i want to say i really really REALLY feel for you, as i recognize my son in yourr description of your own son.  he was also raised in a very attached way, breastfed til 4.5 years old, co-slept, wore him in a sling, super alternative schools,  etc.  he was my second child, so i felt i had made my mistakes with my first and knew what i wanted to do &quot;right&quot; with him.  but he is a really different person than my older child, and, although i still believe all those things were right (except school) - it didn&#39;t make things easy.<br/>
<br/>
that said, my son is almost 11, and the most difficult time was from 8-10, with the greatest transformation coming from a complete paradigm shift within our family.  we still struggle - he still struggles - with STRONG emotions, a tendency to blame, a negative first response, and a not so great self esteem, truthfully, but things are dramatically better than they were a year ago, and i do think he would be struggling with much of this regardless of what we did to help - it would just be a LOT worse if he was still in school, and if we were still making some of the mistakes we were making up until a year ago.  <br/>
<br/>
in fact, i actually think he would not be functioning as a human at all if things had been allowed to go on much longer.  it was truly tearing our family apart and his sanity apart.<br/>
<br/>
so- yeah - i get it.  i feel for you - now i am going to respond to the separate parts of your post below:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  My son (almost 9) did<br/>
  come home for about 7 months but found being home &quot;too boring&quot; and went back<br/>
  to school.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  my son gets bored a lot too - he has a sort of inner restlessness and i think some anxiety underlying it, and he feels unsettled often.  i have found he needs MUCH more of me - my availability, my ideas, my initiation, my laughter, my touch, me being *interesting* - AND interesTED in what HE is interested in, than my other child, to stay centered and contented.  how does  your son feel about school?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  The problem is that my son is verbally and physically abusive to me and his<br/>
  siblings. He treats virtually no one with respect even though that is not<br/>
  the way he is treated. It is starting to rub off on my two other kids as<br/>
  they learn to handle things the way my oldest does. badly!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  it took me a lot to figure out, and it still challenges me at times, but if i were you, i&#39;d REALLY examine what feeling respected looks like to him.  my son has finally been able to tell me/help me see/i&#39;ve figured out, all the ways in which he was NOT being respected for *who he is* and how, even if we are respecting him in the ways WE want to be respected, the ways that are meaningful to *him* are the ways in which he will actually receive respect/experience it/learn how to give it.<br/>
<br/>
  i am going to respond to the rest in a separate post so this doesn&#39;t get too long.<br/>
<br/>
  warmly, Lyla<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-120034103"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Just a few for instance scenarios from today: My oldest was mad that his<br/>
 </span></blockquote>three year old brother went into the room they are SUPPOSED to share and got<br/>
into his crafting supplies. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
supposed to?  how did that get decided?  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Never mind the fact that the 3 year old gets<br/>
 </span></blockquote>ousted from his own room I have suggested numerous times that if he does not<br/>
want his brother to go in there all he needs to do is shut the door, since<br/>
baby brother cannot open it.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
he isn&#39;t old enough to be expected to remember to do that.  and even if he WAS &#39;technically&quot; old enough, if he keeps forgetting, he, personally, isn&#39;t capable.  he needs help.  he needs a safe high place to keep his special stuff.  he needs you to make sure it is put away safely out of reach of the 3 year old...etc.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He almost never shuts the door though and in<br/>
 </span></blockquote>fact almost never shuts the doors to the house which has resulted in his<br/>
brother running outside and into the street. So. his brother messed with his<br/>
stuff. He responded by running out of the room and punching his brother in<br/>
the back and saying &quot;he deserved it!&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
we definitely have had  lots of &quot;deserves&quot; and &quot;retribution&quot; type talk and actions with our son, even though that isn&#39;t how we function with him.  i do think some of it is developmental - that stage of black and white thinking, very concrete.  at 8, most kids just don&#39;t have the impulse control or the frontal lobe capacity to reign themselves in when overcome with emotion, and extra-intense kids who feel things even more strongly often seem to have even less of that impulse control.  we need to be their &quot;surrogate frontal lobe&quot; - we need to use our superior prediction skills, our &quot;radar&quot; for things amping up, our preventive skills, etc. to avoid that amping up of emotions o step in before things escalate when we miss the first cues.  have you read &quot;the explosive child&quot;?  i&#39;d really recommend it - make sure to get the newer version, as he fixed a lot of the less unschooly-friendly aspects.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I talked to him about it and couldn&#39;t get him to see that he can&#39;t hit his<br/>
 </span></blockquote>siblings. He insists that if they do this or that then he WILL hit them. He<br/>
tells me matter-o-factly that THIS is the way it is!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
talk and reasoning and &quot;getting him to see&quot;  is totally ineffective for most 8 year olds, and especially those who are overwhelmed with emotion.   did you try empathy?  without correction first?  without &quot;getting him&quot; to see or accept or acknowledge anything?  LISTENING to him and really getting him - empathizing with his strong emotions, will likely go muuuuuuuuuuuch further with helping him learn, over time, to empathize and listen to others.  and by listen i mean listen - with ears and heart - not &quot;obey&quot; - which is what many people actually mean when they say &quot;listen&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Today as we were leaving his grandmother&#39;s house for a visit he was mad that<br/>
 </span></blockquote>a puzzle she bought had to stay at her home. So he threw it across the room<br/>
in a rage. I stood by the door and told him we would leave after he picked<br/>
up the puzzle pieces and put it away. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
first - i would have seen if it WAS actually possible to borrow the puzzle.  and if not, really truly empathized with how much he wanted to.  then - if he still threw it, i would take that as a sign that he had crossed over in to *totally irrational* phase - and that pushing him further into that zone, with forced cleaning, shaming, etc., would ONLY make things more miserable - and would definitely not teach the lesson intended.  i&#39;d clean it up myself, or ask my parents to do it (hopefully that would work with the relationship) and *get my kid out of there* to a safe space.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;He spent a few minutes throwing it<br/>
 </span></blockquote>around some more and then realized I was serious and eventually picked it<br/>
up. He was so furious about having to pick up the mess he made that he<br/>
walked out the door smacking a Snapple bottle on the side of the house until<br/>
it broke and squirted tea all over him. My 5 year daughter laughed and so he<br/>
assaulted her and started hitting her saying that she laughed so she<br/>
&quot;deserves this&quot;.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
yeah - whenever i engage in a power struggle with my kids i lose.  even if they do what i want.  because when we engage in a power struggle, we aren&#39;t usually actually trying to get the THING done (was the puzzle really the issue for you?) - we are TRYING to teach a lesson.  and nobody will learn with forced teaching.  that&#39;s kind of a primary basis for unschooling!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;All the way he home he fought with his siblings, often deliberately doing<br/>
 </span></blockquote>things to provoke them and then lying about it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
if you knew he did it, how come he had a chance to lie?  if you asked him &quot;did you ___&quot; when you knew the answer, that is a set up for him to lose.  he needed a partner, not another adversary.  and not to feel like a black sheep - with the &quot;good, younger siblings&quot; agains him....<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.A couple times he hit me in<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the head while I was driving with something from the back seat. By the time<br/>
we got home I had it and sent him to his room.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;He doesn&#39;t seem to know how to deal with anger and he could not handle being<br/>
 </span></blockquote>made to clean up after his own tantrum so it turned into a 2 hour session of<br/>
torturing to get back at us.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
thhat&#39;s because a tantrum is a cry for help.  not getting that help, and then being asked to &quot;clean up&quot; without help (figuratively and literally) is just twisting the knife...i know that sounds harsh, and i KNOW you didn&#39;t mean it that way.  but i suspect that&#39;s how he experienced it...<br/>
<br/>
and if you had gone to him (or next time if you go to him) and apologize for not handling it well, and find true empathy and connection with him, i&#39;d be willing to bet he would &quot;need&quot; to &quot;torture&quot; you all fo 2 hours.  and who is the &quot;us&quot;?  do you hear the us vs. him sentiment in your post?  you can *bet* he feels it. :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He has zero friends because truthfully no one can stand him for long. He<br/>
ends up getting bullied at school because he has rather bizarre behavior,<br/>
clucking like chicken, shrill screams for no reason, clapping loudly in<br/>
people&#39;s faces, etc. I assume they are tics of some sort and have often felt<br/>
he has some high functioning autism characteristics.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
so why is he in school? how does he feel about not having friends? what are his *triggers* for those behaviors? does he do that at home?  in safe places? when he feels good?  or just at school/when under stress?  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;We just moved into a new house and he made a new friend that lasted for all<br/>
 </span></blockquote>of 3 days until the parents of the child ordered my son to go away and stay<br/>
away.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
it sounds like he needs WAY more support when outside/around other people.  an 8 year old, alone, with no friends, and few people skills, is not likely to make friends/be well received by neighbors.  can you be out there with him while he rrides around?  more engagement? games with the neighbor kids? it sounds like he is being set up to fail and then blamed for failing.  he NEEDS you to know him - really know him - and support him with that knowledge by being there for him in the areas in which he struggles.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This morning I caught him yelling at the paper boy to get off our property.<br/>
He does not seem to realize or care that this behavior is the reason why he<br/>
has no friends.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
or maybe he realizes AND cares but does not have the TOOLS to do differently. he needs your help. and time.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When we<br/>
 </span></blockquote>do it is not good enough. I got season passes to the zoo and he will throw a<br/>
fit about not being able to ride the amusement park rides at the theme park<br/>
next door or throw a fit if I only stay 4 hours and he doesn&#39;t get to see<br/>
every single exhibit. I just feel like nothing we do for him is enough. He<br/>
is always unhappy and angry. saying life is unfair, we are unfair, and they<br/>
we are bad parents. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
it sounds like it&#39;s a perpetual deep feeling of discontent, not being *seen* and understood, etc. - and the best way he knows how to communicate that is with tangible complaints.  i&#39;d bet if he feels safer, more accepted, and *seen*, he will be more receptive to life&#39;s natural limits. that said, get creative!  find ways to say YES as best you can. collaborate on decisions regarding money expenditures.  honor his values, interests and passions.  it really can be easier!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I also want to note that he has TONS of freedom. He has no bedtime, chores,<br/>
or even any rules beyond don&#39;t hurt anyone or their property. He spends most<br/>
of his days out on his bike riding around and playing. by himself. I only<br/>
ask that he not go too far away and make me have to mount a search party to<br/>
find him. and he usually abides that. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
that sounds very lonely, actually.  i mean, it might be idyllic for some - but given that your son sounds so unhappy, i&#39;d say it isn&#39;t working for him!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in his room he has a 50 inch TV,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>cable, two video game consoles, a Nintendo DS, and hundreds of DVDs. He has<br/>
no limits on any of it. time or content. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
is there CONNECTION around his interests?  do you bring him snacks while he plays in his room?  do you talk to him about his shows or games?  watch with him?  what is he interested in?  what is your role in expanding on that?  it sounds like he has THINGS but not relationship...forgive me if i am misreading.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I also feel I spend so much time trying to protect my<br/>
 </span></blockquote>other kids from him and counteract the negative example he leaves for them.<br/>
My daughter is in constant reaction mode. just waiting for him to do<br/>
something to her or one of her belongings. I want to cry when I hear my 3<br/>
year old saying &quot;stop. your hurting me!&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;d urge you to be CLOSER at all times. make sure he doesnt&#39; have a chance to hurt anyone, because every time he does, he is hurting himself too, and every time you don&#39;t get there in time to stop him, you are losing an oppotunity to help him!  try not to think of him as the perpetrator and your other kids as victims, he is a victim of himself in a way and all your kids will learn something very valuable from observing and receiving proactive empathy and support and prevention.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As I write this he just came up to me screaming and demanding to know why I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>was in his room messing with his TV and turning the channel. I told him that<br/>
I have not been in his room and he screams &quot;LIAR!&quot; at me and runs out of the<br/>
house.. Sigh. This is the norm with him.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
i fear i have been harsh - but i want to end with this - because i really really do get how hard this is.  i have been the recipient of the same, seemingly irrational behavior.  but there is always more underneath - there IS some rhyme to the reason.  or reason to the rhyme?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I am really looking for some advice here. don&#39;t be afraid to hurt my<br/>
 </span></blockquote>feelings if I am screwing it all up. I need to find peace for my son for all<br/>
our sakes.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
well, i hope i haven&#39;t hurt your feelings, and i hope i&#39;ve maybe helped a little. <br/>
warmly, Lyla<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1669102703">I think we need some more information.<br/>
<br/>
Is there another older kid - you mention two in school (or do you mean the 5 <br/>
year old as the other school age kid?)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; My husband who was absent for most of his formative years cause he was <br/>
a truckdriver is now home. We decided to do with less money so he could be <br/>
home all the time. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m confused about this. When you say &quot;home all the time&quot; do you mean that <br/>
he is the primary caregiver undertaking the unschooling, or that his job is <br/>
outside the home, but doesn&#39;t require travelling? I&#39;m guessing the latter <br/>
since he is absent from your story other than this mention, but I don&#39;t want <br/>
to make recommendations based on a possibly wrong guess.<br/>
<br/>
I think it sounds a lot like all your kids are without an adult presence <br/>
much of the time. I mean an immediate, in the same room, right beside them <br/>
participating or observing adult presence. There are many clues in your <br/>
story that suggest that you are in another room or part of the house <br/>
altogether, and only responding after you hear a problem arising, talking <br/>
after the blowup has occurred. Immediately after a blowup or meltdown with <br/>
emotions still running high is the worst time for a lot of words. Another <br/>
quiet time, when everyone is calm and relaxed, is better for talking over <br/>
problems and asking for their ideas for solutions.<br/>
<br/>
When it seemed there were frequent blowups with my dd, Jayn, and her <br/>
neighbor friends, my answer was to be a visible presence. It prevented some <br/>
instances and also ensured that one child who was prone to lying couldn&#39;t <br/>
get away with it, since there was an adult witness. After a time the problem <br/>
behaviors faded away, with natural development and maturity on the part of <br/>
all the kids.<br/>
<br/>
This is not the 1950&#39;s when (to judge by contemporary movies) it was <br/>
commonplace and apparently expected that kids would roam around <br/>
neighborhoods on their bikes or afoot. I think your son is wandering off <br/>
alone too much and too far from home for an evidently immature 8 year old. <br/>
OTOH it would help if home were more fun so that he wanted to stay there. It <br/>
sounds like home is a place where he is being expected to entertain himself <br/>
with his plethora of gadgets. Jayn loves her Nintendo DS, especially when <br/>
she links to Daddy&#39;s. She loves Wii as long as someone is playing with her. <br/>
She loves playing on line games, as long as she can frequently show me the <br/>
dressed up characters she has created.<br/>
<br/>
We too have had changes in our financial circumstances. It has been hard on <br/>
Jayn who has been used to being able to add things to her collections, and <br/>
on all of us because we loved travelling a lot to visit our unschooling <br/>
friends. But we have been open with her about our situation and our hopes <br/>
for the future. Sometimes she complains and wishes, but most of the time she <br/>
is happy to make lists, and save towards things. She has even started her <br/>
own business with the idea of contributing to her own happiness.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn is very obnoxious when she is hungry. She makes poor decisions and <br/>
speaks appallingly rudely to me. That is when she is likely to throw stuff. <br/>
My dh has recently pointed out that I get cranky and speak haughtily and <br/>
rudely (without hearing it in myself) when I am hungry too! Maybe your ds is <br/>
getting hungry more often and sooner than you would expect. Were there <br/>
plenty of snacks available at Grandma&#39;s that time?<br/>
<br/>
Jayn also sometimes irritated her playmates by wanting to be overly <br/>
controlling or bossy - or at least she sounds bossy, without intending to <br/>
be. We have had conversations about asking what others would like to play <br/>
and sharing the decision making process.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about to be summer. Make home much more interesting and fun than school <br/>
was, then offer to just stay home and keep on having fun come fall as if <br/>
school wasn&#39;t there.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1050275227"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Hi all, this is my first post and sorry up front for the novella. I have<br/>
<br/>
&gt; been observing for a couple months now. I am not going to classify myself as<br/>
&gt; a RU... just a mom who sees many benefits of adding unschooling philosophy<br/>
&gt; to our current ideas on attached, respectful parenting. It is the ideas as<br/>
&gt; it pertains to the whole family dynamic that appeal to me since my two<br/>
&gt; school age kids are in public school, their choice. My son (almost 9) did<br/>
&gt; come home for about 7 months but found being home &quot;too boring&quot; and went back<br/>
&gt; to school.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If being at home is boring for him then it follows that being at school is less boring for him. You should ask him what he finds less boring about school.<br/>
<br/>
Also, it sounds to me as if you might be self-sacrificing. You try to give him everything he wants immediately even when it is inconvenient for you. This naturally makes you a bit angry and annoyed and affects your behaviour toward him whether you intend it to or not. As a result he is never sure about whether he can trust you not to get angry and so he lets any dissatisfaction he feels build up until he releases it by asking you for something you find unreasonable.<br/>
<br/>
You and your child need to find a way of getting things you want without hurting one another. You need to start finding common preferences when you and your child have a conflict. A common preference is an option that you both prefer to whatever you wanted to do originally. You need to pay attention to him a lot more and start heading off problems before he starts hitting people. You need to think creatively about things he might like to do and suggest them in advance. And you need to explain to him that he has a lot to gain by cooperating with other people:<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This post is about him. It has been one of those days when I am so<br/>
&gt; discouraged I just want to roll up into a ball and stay like that for days.<br/>
&gt; I have three kids, 3, 5, and 8. My 8 year son is so challenging I am at my<br/>
&gt; wit&#39;s end.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He was pretty much raised in a very attached home. I breastfed, he co-slept<br/>
&gt; from the beginning, he was carried every waking moment or he would scream,<br/>
&gt; and he has been raised with very few arbitrary rules. I did have to work<br/>
&gt; outside the home until he was almost 4 though. :-( I was raised in a very<br/>
&gt; verbally and sometime physically abusive environment so I am not saying that<br/>
&gt; I have been the perfect peaceful parent. I have a temper. But from the<br/>
&gt; beginning I knew I wanted to raise my kids differently then I was and that<br/>
&gt; meant no barrage of stupid rules or smothering my kids with endless<br/>
&gt; expectations.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s good.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The problem is that my son is verbally and physically abusive to me and his<br/>

&gt; they learn to handle things the way my oldest does. badly!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just a few for instance scenarios from today: My oldest was mad that his<br/>
&gt; three year old brother went into the room they are SUPPOSED to share and got<br/>
&gt; into his crafting supplies. Never mind the fact that the 3 year old gets<br/>
&gt; ousted from his own room I have suggested numerous times that if he does not<br/>
&gt; want his brother to go in there all he needs to do is shut the door, since<br/>
&gt; baby brother cannot open it. He almost never shuts the door though and in<br/>
&gt; fact almost never shuts the doors to the house which has resulted in his<br/>
&gt; brother running outside and into the street. So. his brother messed with his<br/>
&gt; stuff. He responded by running out of the room and punching his brother in<br/>
&gt; the back and saying &quot;he deserved it!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why doesn&#39;t he close the door? He wants his brother to come in so he can hit him.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I talked to him about it and couldn&#39;t get him to see that he can&#39;t hit his<br/>
&gt; siblings. He insists that if they do this or that then he WILL hit them. He<br/>
&gt; tells me matter-o-factly that THIS is the way it is!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Seems to me that you&#39;re focusing on what he should not do rather than on explaining that the reason he shouldn&#39;t do it is that there are much better ways for him to get what he wants. If he finds common preferences with other people instead of hitting the he gets access not just to the ideas he has about what kinds of things are interesting and fun but also to the ideas of the rest of the family.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Today as we were leaving his grandmother&#39;s house for a visit he was mad that<br/>
&gt; a puzzle she bought had to stay at her home. So he threw it across the room<br/>
&gt; in a rage. I stood by the door and told him we would leave after he picked<br/>
&gt; up the puzzle pieces and put it away. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Did you offer to buy him another copy of the puzzle? What about buying a new copy of the puzzle for the grandmother and taking her copy?<br/>
<br/>
If you see he&#39;s interested in something ask him he cant take away ask him if he would like one well before you have to leave so that he has time to adapt and won&#39;t blow up later.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He spent a few minutes throwing it<br/>
&gt; around some more and then realized I was serious and eventually picked it<br/>
&gt; up. He was so furious about having to pick up the mess he made that he<br/>
&gt; walked out the door smacking a Snapple bottle on the side of the house until<br/>
&gt; it broke and squirted tea all over him. My 5 year daughter laughed and so he<br/>
&gt; assaulted her and started hitting her saying that she laughed so she<br/>
&gt; &quot;deserves this&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; All the way he home he fought with his siblings, often deliberately doing<br/>
&gt; things to provoke them and then lying about it. A couple times he hit me in<br/>
&gt; the head while I was driving with something from the back seat. By the time<br/>
&gt; we got home I had it and sent him to his room.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He doesn&#39;t seem to know how to deal with anger and he could not handle being<br/>
&gt; made to clean up after his own tantrum so it turned into a 2 hour session of<br/>
&gt; torturing to get back at us.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>While he is angry he&#39;s not likely to be willing to deal with whatever is bothering him. So you need to try to head things off before he gets angry.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He has zero friends because truthfully no one can stand him for long. He<br/>
&gt; ends up getting bullied at school because he has rather bizarre behavior,<br/>
&gt; clucking like chicken, shrill screams for no reason, clapping loudly in<br/>
&gt; people&#39;s faces, etc. I assume they are tics of some sort and have often felt<br/>
&gt; he has some high functioning autism characteristics.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The only way he knows of getting what he wants is annoying other people until they give him what he wants or he gets rid of them through violence. Also he probably gets a rush from hitting people because of the danger they&#39;ll hit him back.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We just moved into a new house and he made a new friend that lasted for all<br/>
&gt; of 3 days until the parents of the child ordered my son to go away and stay<br/>
&gt; away.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yesterday the father came to my door banging loudly and when I opened it he<br/>
&gt; yelled at me to keep my &quot;KID&quot; off his property. Apparently he sits on his<br/>
&gt; bike in front of their property or in their driveway, probably hoping the<br/>
&gt; child will come out. When I told my son that the man came over, he assumed<br/>
&gt; it was a different neighbor from a completely different street! So he has<br/>
&gt; already got two families in our new neighborhood mad at us. And<br/>
&gt; unfortunately for my daughter she is also not allowed to play at the<br/>
&gt; neighbor&#39;s house because of my son, so he is ruining her friendships too.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This morning I caught him yelling at the paper boy to get off our property.<br/>
&gt; He does not seem to realize or care that this behavior is the reason why he<br/>
&gt; has no friends.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If the only tool you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He is also not doing so well adjusting to a new economic situation. My<br/>
&gt; husband who was absent for most of his formative years cause he was a truck<br/>
&gt; driver is now home. We decided to do with less money so he could be home all<br/>
&gt; the time. This means that all the kids have to do with less. We don&#39;t live<br/>
&gt; in as a nice a house, we don&#39;t give them as many toys and gifts, we don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; vacation as much and we used to do a lot. But the finances as well as the<br/>
&gt; fact that my son doesn&#39;t respect or care for any of his possessions is<br/>
&gt; wearing thin on us. He has trashed 4 bikes and gone through 4-5 DVD players<br/>
&gt; in the past 2 years. I don&#39;t think a day goes by when we don&#39;t have at least<br/>
&gt; 1 tantrum about having to say no to some request that involves us spending<br/>
&gt; quite a bit of money on him. new rollerblades to replace the ones he left<br/>
&gt; outside to get ruined, a visit to the water park, a trip to the batting<br/>
&gt; cages. He has expensive tastes and we cannot fulfill his requests. When we<br/>
&gt; do it is not good enough. I got season passes to the zoo and he will throw a<br/>
&gt; fit about not being able to ride the amusement park rides at the theme park<br/>
&gt; next door or throw a fit if I only stay 4 hours and he doesn&#39;t get to see<br/>
&gt; every single exhibit. I just feel like nothing we do for him is enough. He<br/>
&gt; is always unhappy and angry. saying life is unfair, we are unfair, and they<br/>
&gt; we are bad parents. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I also want to note that he has TONS of freedom. He has no bedtime, chores,<br/>
&gt; or even any rules beyond don&#39;t hurt anyone or their property. He spends most<br/>
&gt; of his days out on his bike riding around and playing. by himself. I only<br/>
&gt; ask that he not go too far away and make me have to mount a search party to<br/>
&gt; find him. and he usually abides that. In his room he has a 50 inch TV,<br/>
&gt; cable, two video game consoles, a Nintendo DS, and hundreds of DVDs. He has<br/>
&gt; no limits on any of it. time or content. So our struggles have nothing to do<br/>
&gt; with his rebelling against all our unfair rules because there really aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; any. If anything he is rebelling against the only real limitations we have<br/>
&gt; which are in regards to people and property.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He feels bad because he has bad ideas about how to live his life that lead to him being unable to cooperate with other people. You need to find a time when he&#39;s not angry and talk to him about how to solve problems. You need to explain that he will benefit by finding common preferences with other people.. And you need to understand that you should not try to act as a doormat because that hurts both you and him.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Anyway, his behavior is getting so stressful that it has me feeling like a<br/>
&gt; failure as a parent. I also feel I spend so much time trying to protect my<br/>
&gt; other kids from him and counteract the negative example he leaves for them.<br/>
&gt; My daughter is in constant reaction mode. just waiting for him to do<br/>
&gt; something to her or one of her belongings. I want to cry when I hear my 3<br/>
&gt; year old saying &quot;stop. your hurting me!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d recommend keeping your son away from the other two for a while. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Don&#39;t know what to do anymore. when I look at my two younger kids I would<br/>
&gt; say that attachment parenting, peaceful & respectful parenting, and<br/>
&gt; unschooling are doing wondrous things. I cannot say the same when I look at<br/>
&gt; my oldest.. I just wonder what the heck I am doing wrong.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As I write this he just came up to me screaming and demanding to know why I<br/>
&gt; was in his room messing with his TV and turning the channel. I told him that<br/>
&gt; I have not been in his room and he screams &quot;LIAR!&quot; at me and runs out of the<br/>
&gt; house.. Sigh. This is the norm with him.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Seems to me like the thing to say here is: &quot;Do you want help with your TV?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am really looking for some advice here. don&#39;t be afraid to hurt my<br/>
&gt; feelings if I am screwing it all up. I need to find peace for my son for all<br/>
&gt; our sakes.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;ve done some very good things that most people never think of doing. You&#39;ve just focused a bit too much on lack of coercion rather than problem-solving.<br/>

myself as<br/>
a RU... just a mom who sees many benefits of adding unschooling  <br/>
philosophy<br/>
to our current ideas on attached, respectful parenting. It is the  <br/>
ideas as<br/>
it pertains to the whole family dynamic that appeal to me since my two<br/>
school age kids are in public school, their choice.-=-<br/>
<br/>
This list isn&#39;t for helping people with problems school is causing or  <br/>
exacerbating.   It&#39;s overwhelming to unschoolers here sometimes, the  <br/>
volume and depth of unschooling problems they read and try to assist  <br/>
with.<br/>
<br/>
I nearly didn&#39;t let the post through, but considered that others might  <br/>
have more energy and patience than I did for it.<br/>
<br/>
This list is also not for helping people think that unschooling kind  <br/>
of is anywhere near full-on unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll read the responses and write more.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1658586577">Thx for the response Kelly. :-)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;When he was home, what did he do? Did<br/>
you do stuff with him, or was he just sort<br/>
of at loose ends? I wonder why he<br/>
felt so bored at home that he prefered<br/>
going (returing?) to school?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We worked on &quot;school&quot; stuff per his request in the mornings but then for the<br/>
rest of the day he was pretty much left to do whatever he wanted and he<br/>
ended up deciding that being alone all day while the other kids in the area<br/>
went to school was boring. Since I work from home I could not spend my days<br/>
making sure he was entertained or taking him to places where he could<br/>
socialize. I think it was being around lots of other kids that he missed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I may very well be misreading the situation, but could<br/>
your child be crying out for your attention, in his<br/>
own way?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When he is acting out like this, it is very helpful for me to take him and<br/>
do something alone with him. a movie, read a book, etc BUT his good mood<br/>
only lasts as long as the activity. If I read 4 chapters of Harry Potter for<br/>
instance he will demand to know why I won&#39;t read more and maybe throw the<br/>
book across the room and we are back where we started.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-378237438">Thanks Alan, I appreciate the response. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Also, it sounds to me as if you might be self-sacrificing. You try to give<br/>
him everything he wants immediately even when it is inconvenient for you.<br/>
This naturally makes you a bit angry and annoyed and affects your behaviour<br/>
toward him whether you intend it to or not. As a result he is never sure<br/>
about whether he can trust you not to get angry and so he lets any<br/>
dissatisfaction he feels build up until he releases it by asking you for<br/>
something you find unreasonable.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, you are very right. My world seems to revolve around him and yet he is<br/>
still unhappy with everything I do. It does create some anger in me. I don&#39;t<br/>
want him to be grateful, just not disrespectful and mean.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Did you offer to buy him another copy of the puzzle? What about buying a<br/>
new copy of the puzzle for the grandmother and taking her copy?<br/>
<br/>
If you see he&#39;s interested in something ask him he cant take away ask him if<br/>
he would like one well before you have to leave so that he has time to adapt<br/>
and won&#39;t blow up later.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I &quot;could&quot; have offered to buy him a puzzle but then I would have inevitably<br/>
run into the situation at the store where the other two kids also &quot;want&quot;<br/>
something since he is getting something and I just spent a fortune to<br/>
appease his demands. The puzzle thing was his acting out about the way his<br/>
grandmother buys presents for him and his sister that can only be used at<br/>
her home. She wants them to have things to do when they visit her and she<br/>
doesn&#39;t allow them to take the stuff home. He feels that if it is his he<br/>
should be able to have it without conditions but his grandmother won&#39;t budge<br/>
on it so it is something he needs to accept. I try not to dwell on it so he<br/>
ends up having anger towards his grandmother but I cannot afford to buy<br/>
duplicates of everything so he has one at her house and one at mine.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;While he is angry he&#39;s not likely to be willing to deal with whatever is<br/>
bothering him. So you need to try to head things off before he gets angry.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I do need to be much better at this. I said his sister was in constant<br/>
reaction mode but I am too.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Seems to me like the thing to say here is: &quot;Do you want help with your TV?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I guess it was important to me to establish that I did not do was accused<br/>
of.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You&#39;ve done some very good things that most people never think of doing.<br/>
You&#39;ve just focused a bit too much on lack of coercion rather than<br/>
problem-solving.&quot;<br/>

Yes, I think this is exactly it. <br/>

i think some anxiety underlying it, and he feels unsettled often. i  <br/>

<br/>
==============================<br/>

People rarely think about &quot;boredom.&quot;  It&#39;s a vague complaint.   It  <br/>

<br/>
Also, to make a choice, one needs to HAVE a choice.  If home was more  <br/>
boring than school, that wasn&#39;t much choice.<br/>
Anytime an unschooling home is boring, the parents need to step it up  <br/>
and make it interesting.   But more than just interesting, it should  <br/>
be peaceful, and joyful, and nurturing (body/soul/spirit).<br/>

<br/>
You have your answer right there. Your homeschooling experiment failed because he was only schooled at home and not engaged by being at home or out in the world with his family. And you are continuing to do the same thing with him in school. He is forced to find his own entertainment and when you do read with him, engage with him, if he isn&#39;t happy with what you give you get irritated that he isn&#39;t grateful. <br/>
<br/>
What if when he wants more engagement you give it to him? If your voice is gone after 4 chapters of Harry Potter offer to do something else with him. Don&#39;t withdraw from activities with him. Keep going. It sounds like your son is so very needy and it will take a lot of work from you and your husband to help him to fill the void that so much figuring out what to do on his own has left. He is an 8 year old boy who needs your company and your time to be able to negotiate his world. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Having read the rest of your post, I think he is unhappy at home because <br/>
he feels neglected and like everyone there thinks there is something <br/>
wrong with him and like he can&#39;t do anything right.<br/>
<br/>
You have unrealistic expectations - probably based on observing other <br/>
families and thinking yours &quot;should&quot; be able to be like them. You <br/>
probably have thoughts like, &quot;He&#39;s 8 years old; he SHOULD be able to <br/>
.....&quot; fill in the blank with whatever it is he doesn&#39;t do that you <br/>
think he should.<br/>
<br/>
It will be hard for you to turn this around, but you&#39;re well on the way <br/>
to having truly severe and dangerous issues when he&#39;s older and the <br/>
effort it will take to turn this around now is far far far less than the <br/>
heartache and pain you&#39;re setting yourself up for in maybe as little as <br/>
5 years in the future. Entering the teen years with these dynamics in <br/>
place is a recipe for disaster. If you think it is hard now, imagine it <br/>
with sex, drugs and alcohol, shoplifting, and so on, added to the mix.<br/>
<br/>
You CAN turn it around, but it will be entirely dependent on whether or <br/>
not you and your husband can completely change your attitudes toward <br/>
him. He desperately needs you to be on his side, not facing off with him <br/>
as his adversary. This is going to be very difficult for you because you <br/>
don&#39;t really know how to do it. You picked up on the idea of not having <br/>
limits, of providing him with the things he wants, but you haven&#39;t <br/>
grasped, at all, the idea of being his supporter and facilitator.<br/>
<br/>
He desperately needs you to see him and treat him as a wonderful person <br/>
whom you absolutely adore. Not tolerate. Not love in spite of his <br/>
behaviors. He needs you to see THROUGH the behaviors to his inner core. <br/>
Only you will ever care enough to do that for him.<br/>
<br/>
If you get to that point, you will see all his behaviors for what they <br/>
really are and you can respond to them appropriately.<br/>
<br/>
WHEN he feels you are on his side, things will be very different.<br/>
<br/>
The way things are now, if you tell him, &quot;You&#39;re being too loud,&quot; he&#39;s <br/>
likely to get louder - screaming, &quot;I can be as loud as I want,&quot; or <br/>
something like that.<br/>
<br/>
If he feels you are on his side, you can tell him, &quot;You&#39;re being too <br/>
loud,&quot; and he&#39;s likely to say, &quot;Oh, sorry, thanks for reminding me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Seriously. I know it is hard for  you to imagine it, but it is entirely <br/>
about parental attitude.<br/>
<br/>
Because things are already bad between you, you&#39;ll have to set up the <br/>
environment for as much success as possible.<br/>
<br/>
He should NOT be sharing a room with a younger sibling, for example. <br/>
But, thinking about that, are you tempted to say to him, &quot;You can&#39;t be <br/>
trusted to get along with your siblings, so now life is much more <br/>
difficult because we have to find a way to divide up the rooms just to <br/>
give you your own room which is a big pain for the rest of us.&quot; How <br/>
about, instead, &quot;As the oldest, we think it is important for you to have <br/>
your own safe space where your things are private and secure. You are <br/>
important to us and we are totally willing to do what it takes to help <br/>
you be happy at home.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Also, when is the last time you snuggled up to watch tv with him? When <br/>
did you last go out on your bike and ride around with him?<br/>
<br/>
I have three kids, same age separation as yours. I was the oldest of <br/>
three kids with the same age separation, too. I KNOW what it means for <br/>
the oldest to have their parents totally distracted by younger siblings.<br/>
<br/>
I think you should make a list of his most wonderful characteristics - <br/>
what is lovable, enjoyable, interesting, fun, etc., about him. Make as <br/>
long a list, as detailed a list, as you can. Add to it as often as you <br/>
can. Put it where you&#39;ll see it a lot. It must be honest. TELL him what <br/>
you like about him in very concrete terms.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a little trick - put 10 rubber bands or hair bands loosely <br/>
around one wrist. Your goal is to move all those hair bands to the other <br/>
wrist. Every time you do something that brings you closer to your son, a <br/>
&quot;relationship-building&quot; thing, you move one to the other wrist. Every <br/>
time you do anything that would feel to him like breaking down of your <br/>
relationship, move the band back.<br/>
<br/>
This will help you learn to speak far more kindly and understandingly to <br/>
him. It will help you overlook all but the most egregious behaviors. It <br/>
will support YOU in looking for mutually agreeable solutions, rather <br/>
than assuming his wants are unreasonable.<br/>
<br/>
Think about the example I gave above, of a parent telling a child he is <br/>
being too loud. How would your child FEEL if you told him, &quot;You&#39;re being <br/>
too loud?&quot; What thoughts would go through his head? Stop for a minute <br/>
and think about that - how your son would react and what his thinking, <br/>
inside his own head, would be. Go deeper - not just to &quot;I WANT to be <br/>
loud and I can be and you can&#39;t stop me,&quot; but to what he might be <br/>
thinking about you at that moment.<br/>
<br/>
Your goal is that, eventually, the thoughts going through his head will <br/>
be, &quot;Glad mom is there to help me out when I forget how to behave.&quot;  You <br/>
will NEVER get to that point, though, until he feels absolutely sure <br/>
that you are WITH him, not against him. Make THAT your top priority - it <br/>
might take a long time, this isn&#39;t a quick fix, but very very well worth <br/>
it. Notice the change ALL has to happen in you, you are not trying to <br/>
change him. He will change, but you can&#39;t make him change, you can only <br/>
change your own behavior and wait for him to change himself.<br/>

with kids:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/howto/precisely">http://sandradodd.com/howto/precisely</a><br/>

Of course, every kid is different.  I have three who got<br/>
no loving attention for many years (while living in orphanages)<br/>
and they needed &#39;round the clock attention for several years<br/>
after they joined the family... just as a newborn coming into<br/>
the family would!  My point being, don&#39;t take the chart<br/>
literally:  you will know when your child has enough of you<br/>
attention; he&#39;ll let you know.  Meanwhile, how can you give<br/>
him the loving attention he needs?  (It&#39;s a question for<br/>
you to figure out; I don&#39;t need the answer! ;-)<br/>

If you don&#39;t find a way to give him more, you&#39;ll suffer even more in the <br/>

it. I&#39;m not psychic, but I&#39;m certain of what I&#39;m saying to you, based on <br/>
years of observation.<br/>
<br/>
Can you get a mother&#39;s helper to take care of the younger kids several <br/>
afternoons per week while you take him out, away from them, for some fun <br/>
with you?<br/>
<br/>
You can make the time now, or you&#39;ll be spending a lot of time in the <br/>
principal&#39;s office, in court, in therapists offices, etc., in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Some kids need a LOT of personal attention - yours is crying out for it <br/>
in every way he can. You say he can never get enough - but I think <br/>
you&#39;re lacking in imagination. Figure out how to give him more. Take <br/>
EVERY opportunity. Little moments and long hours - both are needed. Make <br/>
direct eye contact and physical contact every chance you get. Smile a <br/>
lot. Ruffle his hair. Take him little treats, wherever he is. Spend a <br/>
moment just smiling and being there in case he might have something to say.<br/>
<br/>
You can do this - you read this list and knew what we were going to say <br/>

steps a lot. He has his bike beside him; sometimes rides up and down the <br/>
street or in circles in front of his house.<br/>
<br/>
When my 18 year old was jogging, he askedif he could ride his bike <br/>
alongside her. Here is how it goes: HE talks, mostly, she just makes <br/>
little sounds like, &quot;Oh?,&quot; or &quot;Yeah?&quot; He is desperate for someone to <br/>
talk to - he says he has no friends because he talks too much. She runs <br/>
for about  45 minutes and he talks for a lot of that, but by the end he <br/>
starts asking her questions and getting her to talk, too. At the end, he <br/>
asks, &quot;Can I go with you again?&quot; She says, &quot;Sure.&quot; He BEAMS with happiness.<br/>
<br/>
It is so interesting how he finally, after about 30 minutes, he started <br/>
to be interested in her, not just in talking about himself.<br/>

You could ask her not to tell them they&#39;re &quot;presents.&quot;  If it&#39;s HER  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1118262615">-=-. I am not going to classify myself as<br/>
a RU... just a mom who sees many benefits of adding unschooling  <br/>
philosophy<br/>
to our current ideas on attached, respectful parenting. It is the  <br/>
ideas as<br/>
it pertains to the whole family dynamic that appeal to me since my two<br/>
school age kids are in public school, their choice.-=-<br/>
<br/>
-=-He was pretty much raised in a very attached home. I breastfed, he  <br/>
co-slept<br/>
from the beginning, he was carried every waking moment or he would  <br/>
scream,<br/>
and he has been raised with very few arbitrary rules. I did have to work<br/>
outside the home until he was almost 4 though. :-( -=-<br/>
<br/>
Until he was almost four, starting when?<br/>
Who was carrying him every waking moment when you were at work?<br/>
<br/>
-=It has been one of those days when I am so<br/>
discouraged I just want to roll up into a ball and stay like that for  <br/>
days.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Are you clinically depressed, maybe?  (You don&#39;t need to tell us, but  <br/>
you might want to talk to a doctor or maybe a psychologist who does  <br/>
cognitive therapy, or both if it seems to be depression and if it&#39;s  <br/>
getting worse.)<br/>
<br/>
-=-<br/>
I also want to note that he has TONS of freedom. He has no bedtime,  <br/>
chores,<br/>
or even any rules beyond don&#39;t hurt anyone or their property. He  <br/>
spends most<br/>
of his days out on his bike riding around and playing. by himself. I  <br/>
only<br/>
ask that he not go too far away and make me have to mount a search  <br/>
party to<br/>
find him. and he usually abides that. In his room he has a 50 inch TV,<br/>
cable, two video game consoles, a Nintendo DS, and hundreds of DVDs.  <br/>
He has<br/>
no limits on any of it. time or content. So our struggles have nothing  <br/>
to do<br/>
with his rebelling against all our unfair rules because there really  <br/>
aren&#39;t<br/>
any. If anything he is rebelling against the only real limitations we  <br/>
have<br/>
which are in regards to people and property.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s not doing so well with the people and property rules, though,  <br/>
according to some of your stories.<br/>
<br/>
How can a child who&#39;s enrolled in school function with no bedtime or  <br/>
rules?   That doesn&#39;t seem to be a good combination.<br/>
<br/>
To talk about  the &quot;many benefits of adding unschooling philosophy to  <br/>
our current ideas on attached, respectful parenting&quot; while kids are in  <br/>
school and the mom can&#39;t spend time finding cool stuff for them to do  <br/>
or taking them places seems to me a classic case of carts before  <br/>
horses, in two ways.  You&#39;re telling us you have the cart but that  <br/>
it&#39;s not going anywhere, and your son is furious because of things  <br/>
around him (his brother, the puzzle &quot;present,&quot; neighbors).    If  <br/>
you&#39;re not even going to have a horse at all, why have the cart?  If  <br/>
your kids want to go to school, then be a good mother of kids in  <br/>
school.  If you have no choice but to work every day, then do it well  <br/>
and fully.   There IS no unschooling if the kids aren&#39;t home and you  <br/>
weren&#39;t able to create a rich unschooling environment when they were  <br/>
home.<br/>
<br/>
If you do want to unschool, there&#39;s probably not a better place than  <br/>
this to get ideas, but if you don&#39;t want to unschool, I don&#39;t know  <br/>
what the list can do for you.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks all for your great ideas Alan, Pam, Kelly, and Lyla. I think the<br/>
issue has much to do with quality time and letting my son know we love and<br/>
value him as he is.. and I will have to work out a plan with my husband to<br/>
make sure those needs are being met consistently.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Since I really don&#39;t have a choice about making the leap to full unschooling<br/>
unless I also accept living in my car perhaps I will just stick to<br/>
observation only on this list. Sorry to bother you Sandra. <br/>

To talk about the &quot;many benefits of adding unschooling philosophy to <br/>
our current ideas on attached, respectful parenting&quot; while kids are in <br/>
school and the mom can&#39;t spend time finding cool stuff for them to do <br/>
or taking them places seems to me a classic case of carts before <br/>
horses, in two ways. You&#39;re telling us you have the cart but that <br/>
it&#39;s not going anywhere, and your son is furious because of things <br/>

this to get ideas, but if you don&#39;t want to unschool, I don&#39;t know <br/>
what the list can do for you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1018840680">-= Of course we feed them, but the right information about childrens  <br/>
actual nutritional needs is not easy to come by. The big food industri  <br/>
and certinely the pharmaceutical industry have no interest in our  <br/>
childrens wellbeeing, they care about profit.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I let that post through before I noticed it had a very long other post  <br/>
appended to it.<br/>
<br/>
Please only quote what&#39;s necessary to make your own comments make sense.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind people reminding other people to pay attention to whether  <br/>
kids are getting protein or not too many carbs or enough fruit or  <br/>
whatever, but to go into scary and questionable political and  <br/>
corporate conspiracy stuff is way outside the purpose and focus of  <br/>
this list.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone wants to name another list to which people can go to talk  <br/>
about diet in that paranoid &quot;there&#39;s a magic fix&quot; way, that&#39;s fine,  <br/>
but it&#39;s not good to discuss it here for this reason:<br/>
<br/>
If children can&#39;t learn how foods affect them directly, they are being  <br/>
denied a learning opportunity.<br/>
and<br/>
If mothers who are in &quot;yeah, but&#39; and &quot;It&#39;s not my fault&quot; mode can  <br/>
think &quot;Aha!  I didn&#39;t do anything wrong, he&#39;s just allergic to wheat/ <br/>
dairy/strawberries/dye/sugar/corn syrup/soy/MSG/peanuts/  so I&#39;m a  <br/>
great mom and he&#39;s a defective kid,&quot; then the family moves away from  <br/>
unschooling principles and not toward them.<br/>
<br/>
Changing one&#39;s parenting and improving the relationship with one&#39;s  <br/>
child will help a mom provide better for her child in many ways.   <br/>
Looking at things other than parenting and improving the relationship  <br/>
with one&#39;s child risks continuing a pattern that can and should be  <br/>
changed, even if the child ends up doing better on a different diet.<br/>

willingness and commitment to looking at options to make unschooling<br/>
possible, that&#39;s where the choices live.  As someone who lived for YEARS as<br/>
a happy & healthy unschooler, with two kids, a mere $40/mo above the poverty<br/>
level, as a single mama, I&#39;d argue there are LOTS & LOTS & LOTS of choices<br/>
between working full time and homelessness.  ONLY if you&#39;re willing to look<br/>
at them and value people over things.<br/>
Sandra&#39;s not the only one bothered, she&#39;s merely the vocal list owner.<br/>
There are many more of us who have yet to respond, who are still formulating<br/>
and pondering and wondering if there is any help for this little human in<br/>
his current situations.  We&#39;d love to help you see those choices you DO<br/>
have, we&#39;d love to help you provide a home where your son is safe and valued<br/>
- an unschooling home. That&#39;s what we&#39;re about, it&#39;s what we&#39;re doing, it&#39;s<br/>
what we share.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1620902801">-=-So unschooling is all or nothing? I wasn&#39;t aware there were rules.  <br/>
Ironic no?-=-<br/>
<br/>
In what way is it ironic?<br/>
<br/>
The intro to this list is in two places:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/</a><br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/alwayslearning">http://sandradodd.com/alwayslearning</a><br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is not all or nothing.  That doesn&#39;t mean that anything in  <br/>
the world is unschooling, and having a child prefer school because  <br/>
home was boring is not unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
We can help you unschool, but the list does not exist to make you feel  <br/>
better about not unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you wanted support and not actual help.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/support">http://sandradodd.com/support</a><br/>
<br/>
-=-. I think the issue has much to do with quality time and letting my  <br/>
son know we love and<br/>
value him as he is-=-<br/>
<br/>
This is dishonest.  You don&#39;t love and value your son as he is.  You  <br/>
can hardly write about him without using negatively judgmental words  <br/>
and phrases.  If he already doesn&#39;t have faith and trust in your  <br/>
opinions or the hope of your support, &quot;letting him know&quot; something  <br/>
that is belied by your words and attitude won&#39;t make things better.<br/>
<br/>
YOU the parents truly need to change, if you want this situation to  <br/>
get better.  To get angry about suggestions that something is wrong  <br/>
might be a clue to the problem.  Do you get this angry when your son  <br/>
suggests (by word or deed) that you could be doing something better?    <br/>
Because your responses here don&#39;t seem self-reflective, but rather  <br/>
seem to be a defensive bunch of &quot;yeah but.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Since I really don&#39;t have a choice about making the leap to full  <br/>
unschooling<br/>
unless I also accept living in my car &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing this means you didn&#39;t read the links.<br/>
