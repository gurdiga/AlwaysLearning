<div id="ygrps-yiv-39281843">Here, minus the formatting and fonts and color on names and such, <br/>
are the certificates I&#39;m working on to print on special paper and trim and <br/>
roll and tie and put in Christmas stockings.  Thanks for the idea!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This certificate entitles<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Martin Alexander Dodd<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
to create one special holiday to be celebrated each year in his own honor.  <br/>
<br/>
The holiday will be recognized by members of the immediate family and perhaps <br/>
a few others, <br/>
but we probably can’t get it on national calendars.<br/>
<br/>
Pick it, name it, and it’s yours.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On behalf of not too many other people,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Christmas, 2001<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Especially for            Kirby Dodd             from his parents:<br/>
   <br/>
<br/>
One day of your choosing will be celebrated each year as “Kirby Day” <br/>
(in addition to your birthday, which won’t change) if you want.  <br/>
Pick a good day and you get special privileges on that day each year, <br/>
including but not limited to:  picking special foods, riding shotgun, <br/>
and choosing some activity with family or friends.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For Real,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Mom<br/>
<br/>
Christmas, 2001<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
A gift for<br/>
<br/>
Holly Lynn Dodd<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Pick a day to be Holly Day and it will be Holly Day every year.<br/>
(You can name it something different if you want to.)<br/>

Have you ever pondered the different types of poop like the GHOST POOPIE:<br/>
The kind where you feel the poopie come out, but there is no poopie in the<br/>
toilet. <br/>
<br/>
Well the perfect place to find out more is:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-670601208">on th eother hand, as I answer my own post,<br/>
as a child my parents had few rules on our<br/>
use of language, (we were never told not to<br/>
use &quot;4 letter words&quot; but were instead given<br/>
accurate definitions and we discussed how<br/>
others might view us if we used them, etc.)<br/>
but bathroom humor wasn&#39;t allowed.  We<br/>
ignored toots (passing gas), etc. as if they<br/>
hadn&#39;t happened.  My own kids and I, well, we<br/>
discuss it, sometimes humorously.  To ignore<br/>
it is silly--sometimes it&#39;s really not<br/>
ignorable.  I think that if I let my kids<br/>
laugh at their own toots, burps, etc. now,<br/>
then maybe they won&#39;t need to when they are<br/>
older?  OK, I just contradicted myself, I<br/>
don&#39;t need bathroom humor and I wasn&#39;t<br/>
allowed it as a child.  I don&#39;t know, I guess<br/>
I just don&#39;t care.  But to be honest, both my<br/>
kids show a remarkable sense of very<br/>
sophisticated humor, but I guess we do lower<br/>
ourselves (sic) to bathroom humor<br/>
occassionally.<br/>
<br/>
I do worry about Janene saying to some<br/>
stranger &quot;what, you drinking BEER these<br/>
days!&quot;  or something simiilar.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1687055599">When my mom was here visiting a month ago, we went to a learning store and she offered to buy them something. They looked around and found &quot;noise putty&quot;. I&#39;m sure she thought it was like playdough or something - she didn&#39;t look at it too closely. It&#39;s this gloopy glob inside a plastic container and when you push your fingers in it, it makes very realistic fart noises.<br/>
<br/>
On the ride home and they were making these noises and laughing and giggling. My mom said she was sorry that she bought those for them and asked them to stop making those rude noises. I thought it was pretty funny, myself, and wished she could lighten up a bit and let them have their fun. The more she was bothered by it, even through the days left of her visit, the more they wanted to do it. I was also telling them not to upset Grandma that way. She finally threatened to take it away if they wouldn&#39;t stop, so they finally did stop. <br/>
<br/>
Come to think of it, it has been sitting in their room unopened since then. I guess all the fun is gone now. <br/>
I let them have their bathroom humor because they do seem to enjoy it so. <br/>

&gt; humor, but I don&#39;t get it myself either.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Guilty.  I think bathroom/fart/poop/burp jokes are hilarious.  I about fell<br/>
out of the chair laughing when I read Joyce&#39;s original post with the link to<br/>
the poop page.  Not because I found the site that funny, but never in a<br/>
million years would have expected Joyce to have visited a site like that<br/>
(Nancy or Pam H. yes, Joyce never &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
I have shared my love of South Park recently, from that I would think that<br/>
you would all know I like stupid humor.  Maybe it was because I was the 2nd<br/>
son my father never had and he and I would have burping contests together.<br/>
Maybe it is because my best friend as a child was a boy.  Who knows, but I<br/>
find excrement humor belly laughable.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday morning, Dana made up a song to the tune of &quot;Jingle Bell Rock&quot; and<br/>
was singing it to my mother.  In it she described our morning of gifts, mom<br/>
needing her coffee and the dogs going outside to poopy and tinkle.  I guess<br/>
you had to be there, but I was almost on the floor in tears from laughing,<br/>
my mother was mortified.  She thought it was terrible to be singing a song<br/>
of poopy on Christmas morning, and that I was horrible for encouraging my<br/>
child by laughing.<br/>
<br/>
I also like the &quot;sophisticated&quot; humor too, as long as I get the joke.  I<br/>
think I am just an kid in an adults body.<br/>

     A little song<br/>
     A little dance<br/>

&lt;&lt; Little House in the Big Poop<br/>
Legally Poop<br/>

<br/>
THOSE ARE GOOD!<br/>
<br/>
The first time I saw just a part of &quot;Mr. Hankie the Christmas Poo&quot; (I did not <br/>
replace any word with &quot;Poo,&quot; that&#39;s the original) I didn&#39;t think it was <br/>
funny.  But when I knew the characters better and saw the whole episode <br/>
through it&#39;s deeply, disturbingly funny.   South Park makes fun of the depths <br/>
of teacher/student/parent/child/neighbor relations, the psychology we&#39;re all <br/>
taught about them (even when it&#39;s transparently untrue, but we keep acting on <br/>
it), on Jewish/Christian relationships, on political correctness, <br/>
international relations, what kids know about sex even though parents love to <br/>
think they know nothing, <br/>
<br/>
Because we don&#39;t have cable, I see older episodes on video or DVD, or at a <br/>
friend&#39;s house, or someone brings something by.  But I&#39;m not worried about <br/>
it, because eventually I&#39;ll see all of it twice.  I&#39;m not in a hurry.<br/>
<br/>
For Christmas I got the complete Monty Python&#39;s Flying Circus, on 14 DVDs, in <br/>
a box.  WOW!<br/>
<br/>
When I was younger I didn&#39;t get it.  I thought most of it was crummy and <br/>
insipid.  I did love The Holy Grail, but it&#39;s because I knew enough to get <br/>
the jokes.  As years went by and I knew more about England and British TV <br/>
(which is crummy and insipid lots of times), I appreciate it more.  And being <br/>
one of the first American Ali G fans (trying to force my friends to watch <br/>
&quot;Innit&quot; a year and a half ago, and having a translated copy of &quot;Aiiieee,&quot; I <br/>
look at MP&#39;s Flying Circus in that light now.   I used to think it was gross <br/>
that they&#39;d dress like women so much.  It&#39;s not so common in American <br/>
tradition, and when it does happen, like Geraldine (by Flip Wilson), the <br/>
woman seems more likely to be smart and strong, not dippy and confused.<br/>
<br/>
But now I&#39;m looking at skits I had never seen before and really appreciating <br/>
them, and some I had seen before and thinking &quot;OH, now I get it.  Plus <br/>
there&#39;s Terry Jones stuff (each DVD has a &quot;meet the players&quot; feature), and <br/>
some live-on-stage film (which Terry Jones is in, those I&#39;ve seen).<br/>
<br/>
For Christmas I got Marty a South Park calendar, a &quot;Timmy and the Lords of <br/>
the Underworld&quot; concert t-shirt (South Park joke) and a &quot;can of Duff beer&quot; (a <br/>
can with a removeable top containing a pack of Simpson&#39;s playing cards), <br/>
among other less controversial M.C. Escher and construction-set-type things.  <br/>
And he got a high-in-the-line Leatherman and a Zelda pocket watch in his <br/>
stocking.  More manly stuff this year.<br/>
<br/>
I encourage toilet humor in my kids.  Either they get it out of their <br/>
systems, or they become businessmen selling it to others who will never get <br/>
it out of their (ahem...) systems.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Helen Keller, the Musical,&quot; is funny.  Not a poop joke in the whole thing, I <br/>
think.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  So you have &quot;Just As<br/>
I Am under the sheets,&quot; and &quot;One Step At A Time under<br/>
the sheets,&quot; and &quot;Oh, Come, All Ye Faithful...&quot; well,<br/>
you get the drift. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The reason it&#39;s not funny to the moms and dads might be that &quot;There is a <br/>
Fountain Filled with Blood under the sheets&quot;   or &quot;Nothing but the Blood <br/>
under the sheets.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Revive us Again would get dad&#39;s attention again though.<br/>
and<br/>
All Things Bright and Beautiful under the sheets might remind him of his <br/>
youth.<br/>
<br/>
We used to get someone to sing <br/>
Soap, soap, soap, soap in marching rhythm, over and over, on like... <br/>
C, G, A, B<br/>
C, G, A, B           <br/>
(Same as the &quot;Mick-ey-Mouse-Club&quot; bass line on the old Mickey Mouse Club <br/>
theme song)<br/>
<br/>
And when they got it going good, we would sing over it:<br/>
&quot;What can wash away my sins?&quot;<br/>
and at that point they would stop, mortified at their own blasphemy,<br/>
because the next line of the song is &quot;Nothing but the Blood of JEEEEsus.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Those are good songs.  I miss those songs, musically.  <br/>
<br/>
Keith, Holly and I went to a Sacred Harp sing on the 23rd.  Sacred Harp is <br/>
one of several parallel singing-school traditions from the 18th  century, <br/>
still a living tradition though, although I much prefer the 18th and 19th <br/>
century stuff to anything written lately.  I noted some of the lyrics to <br/>
share with you, but will do it in a different post, as they&#39;re not about poop <br/>
or sex.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1069355988">Part of the fun IS the expressions on the &quot;offended&quot;<br/>
adults faces and the comments they make.<br/>
<br/>
When the older boys were middle-sized boys, I began to<br/>
tire of removing the scent around the toilet due to<br/>
misfires. I made targets to place the he toilet bowl<br/>
to aim at and a score sheet taped above the toilet. <br/>
They enjoyed the contest for  a short while..used up<br/>
all the targets quickly, made a REAL mess. Score sheet<br/>
was ignored.  <br/>
<br/>
Once Huck and my Godson chased the chickens around<br/>
peeing on them (they were 5).  They also all had &quot;who<br/>
can pee the farthest&quot; competitions.  The general<br/>
consensus was that it had to do with who drank the<br/>
most liquid and had retained it the longest prior to<br/>

  When the older boys were middle-sized boys, I began to<br/>
  tire of removing the scent around the toilet due to<br/>
  misfires. I made targets to place the he toilet bowl<br/>
  to aim at and a score sheet taped above the toilet. <br/>
  They enjoyed the contest for  a short while..used up<br/>
  all the targets quickly, made a REAL mess. Score sheet<br/>
  was ignored.  <br/>

  Once Huck and my Godson chased the chickens around<br/>
  peeing on them (they were 5).  They also all had &quot;who<br/>
  can pee the farthest&quot; competitions.  The general<br/>
  consensus was that it had to do with who drank the<br/>
  most liquid and had retained it the longest prior to<br/>
  &quot;go&quot;.<br/>
