&gt;&gt;Boy Scouts of America Kick Out 19 Year Old Eagle Scout For Being<br/>
&gt;&gt;Atheist<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Darrell Lambert, Eagle Scout was kicked out of the BSA by the Chief<br/>
&gt;&gt;Seattle Council of Seattle, Washington.  On October 12 at a Scout<br/>
&gt;&gt;Master training Glen Schmidt, Dist. Comm. Chair was quoted as<br/>
&gt;&gt;saying, &quot;I ask scouts during the training if they believe in god and<br/>
&gt;&gt;if they don&#39;t I boot them out. In order for scouts to become good<br/>
&gt;&gt;citizens they must believe in god.&quot;  Darrell responded to the<br/>
&gt;&gt;comment by saying, &quot; I am an atheist and no one in this room can<br/>
&gt;&gt;rightfully say that I&#39;m not a good citizen. Mr. Schmidt you are<br/>
&gt;&gt;discriminating against the 6% of Americans that don&#39;t believe. I got<br/>
&gt;&gt;my Eagle award with my board knowing that I didn&#39;t believe in god.<br/>
&gt;&gt;They don&#39;t discriminate.&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Glen Schmidt, Dist. Comm. Chair then went on to say, &quot;Anybody that<br/>
&gt;&gt;doesn&#39;t believe in god isn&#39;t a good citizen, and that if an atheist<br/>
&gt;&gt;found a wallet on the ground they would pick it up plunder the money<br/>
&gt;&gt;and throw the wallet back on the ground.&quot; Darrell&#39;s mother is a<br/>
&gt;&gt;scout leader and was told by another scout leader, Dave Jones, &quot;if<br/>
&gt;&gt;you have any other boys in scouts that don&#39;t believe in god they<br/>
&gt;&gt;need to be kicked out of scouts.&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;In a phone conversation, Brad Farmer, Council Executive told<br/>
&gt;&gt;Darrell that the BSA couldn&#39;t take his Eagle Award away because he<br/>
&gt;&gt;already received it. He also told Darrell that because he didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;&gt;believe in god he was not welcomed in scouts. In a conversation with<br/>
&gt;&gt;Toby Estes, District Executive the following day, Mr. Estes is<br/>
&gt;&gt;quoted as saying, &quot;Darrell, scouting will be less without you, but<br/>
&gt;&gt;it was the right thing to kick you out.&quot; He also said that &quot;It is<br/>
&gt;&gt;not discrimination it&#39;s policy. Scouts have been kicking atheists<br/>
&gt;&gt;out for years and we are a private organization. Darrell it was also<br/>
&gt;&gt;a mistake you received your Eagle Award.&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;About Darrell  Lambert, Eagle Scout<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Darrell Lambert joined the Boy Scouts of America as a first year<br/>
&gt;&gt;Webelos. He received his arrow of light and colors and went straight<br/>
&gt;&gt;into troop 1531. There he participated as an assistant patrol leader<br/>
&gt;&gt;from the day he started with the troop. Since then he had been a<br/>
&gt;&gt;patrol leader, quartermaster, librarian, assistant senior patrol<br/>
&gt;&gt;leader, den chief, JASM, senior patrol Leader twice, and patrol<br/>
&gt;&gt;leader 2 other times. Darrell received his Eagle award in April of<br/>
&gt;&gt;2001. He joined explorer search and rescue in march of 1999 and<br/>
&gt;&gt;earned a team leader certification a year and a half later. At the<br/>
&gt;&gt;time Darrell was kicked out for being an atheist he was a field<br/>
&gt;&gt;leader in training. He had been actively involved in leadership<br/>
&gt;&gt;competitions through the FFA for his sophomore and junior years in<br/>
&gt;&gt;high school.  He also raised pigs to show at fairs. He was an<br/>
&gt;&gt;agriculture student his sophomore year. His senior year he had 777<br/>
&gt;&gt;hours of community service time spent in athletic medicine class.<br/>
&gt;&gt;Darrell tied for state champion that year, and was the top senior.<br/>
&gt;&gt;Darrell also was a staff person at various weekend camps for trail<br/>
&gt;&gt;of the eagle, and fall camporee, teaching scout skills, and merit<br/>
&gt;&gt;badges. This Last June through September he went to fight Wildfires.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;This is Darrell Lambert, 19 year old Eagle Scout who is considered<br/>
&gt;&gt;by the Boy Scouts of America, not to be a good citizen because he is<br/>
&gt;&gt;an atheist.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Steven Cozza, Eagle Scout &quot;I think it is horrible the Boy Scouts of<br/>
&gt;&gt;America would kick out Darrell Lambert. He is more of an Eagle Scout<br/>
&gt;&gt;then many Eagle Scouts who believe in god. Believing in god is not a<br/>
&gt;&gt;measure of the quality of person. In fact the two murders of Matthew<br/>
&gt;&gt;Shepard was an Eagle scout and a Mormon. The character of a person<br/>
&gt;&gt;is seen by how a person lives his life. Apparently Mr. Farmer, Mr.<br/>
&gt;&gt;Schmidt, and Mr. Estes, lack the strength of character that Darrell<br/>
&gt;&gt;has if they don&#39;t stand by him as the person they truly know he is.<br/>
&gt;&gt;Sometimes rules that people follow are wrong. It would take the<br/>
&gt;&gt;character of an Eagle Scout like Darrell Lambert to point that out.<br/>
&gt;&gt;When will the Boy Scouts of America ever learn that their policy of<br/>
&gt;&gt;discrimination is a violation of their own scout oath and law and<br/>
&gt;&gt;hurts kids? Businesses, individuals, and United Ways should stop<br/>
&gt;&gt;funding an organization that discriminates against nontheists, gays,<br/>
&gt;&gt;and girls.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote> Good grief. My daughter has just joined Girl Scouts and they <br/>
seem fine with the non-Christian bit. Some of the other girls said <br/>
she might go to hell cos she saw Harry Potter and has read read <br/>
the books and were also surprised when she wouldn&#39;t say the <br/>
Pledge (why should she, she&#39;s English) but generally its been fine.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if I want her involved in an organisation like that!!<br/>
