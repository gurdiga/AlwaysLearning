<div id="ygrps-yiv-47609950">-=-DS9 has expressed a desire for privacy away from his siblings,but  <br/>
they<br/>
share a room. Our house is quite small and there is no other real place<br/>
to make a private spot. Any suggestions on how to give him alone  <br/>
time?-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Take him away more?  Take them away more so he has the room or the  <br/>
house to himself a while?<br/>
<br/>
What about the yard?  Treehouses? tents?  &quot;club houses&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t recommend making such a space the other kids aren&#39;t  <br/>
allowed into, but maybe having more spaces will let them spread out  <br/>
more.<br/>
<br/>
If the room is big enough, maybe a loft bed with a space underneath  <br/>
could give him the feel of privacy.  Kind of a club-house inside.<br/>
<br/>
When we were in college some of us rented a house and one room was  <br/>
the passageway to someone else&#39;s room, so the roommate who had that  <br/>
room built a loft bed in front of the walk-in closet.  It gave her a  <br/>
desk and sitting-space under the bed, access into the standing-up  <br/>
space of the closet, and her bed was on top of all that.  She put a  <br/>
curtain across it which she rarely closed, but knowing she could if  <br/>
she wanted to was helpful!<br/>

If I&#39;m lucky, that will take you to pictures of loft beds and you  <br/>
might get some good ideas.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-235810241">I second the loft bed idea.  We don&#39;t have space or privacy issues,  <br/>
but have one because Shelby wanted it.  We have a queen size bed with  <br/>
a sitting area under it.  It would definitely add some privacy.   <br/>
Here&#39;s where we got ours:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.collegebedlofts.com/">http://www.collegebedlofts.com/</a> .  You can  <br/>
also pay just for the plans and buy the wood and stuff yourself if  <br/>
you&#39;re good at that sort of thing.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
