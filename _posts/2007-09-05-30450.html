<div id="ygrps-yiv-2004684984">&quot;The worst thing in the world to be is a boring example to a child.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Christian Bale, talking about being a father to his young daughter,  <br/>
quoted in Entertainment Weekly.<br/>
<br/>
The article is good, although it never mentions his role in Henry V,  <br/>
in which he was great.<br/>
<br/>
His grandfather, the article says, was the stunt double for John  <br/>
Wayne in Hatari.  His dad and grandfather were both pilots (his  <br/>
grandfather a bomber pilot in WWII).  He&#39;s an actor, but is taking  <br/>
his family with him to remote and exotic locations.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When people have asked in the past how to make their homes more  <br/>
interesting, various suggestions are made, but I think the biggest is  <br/>
to be more interesTED in things, to pursue more of your own  <br/>
curiosities, and to find the good and interesting parts of things  <br/>
instead of inventorying them for their stupid and inferior and boring  <br/>
parts.   We could define lots of things as stupid and boring, but  <br/>
everytime we do that, we make our worlds smaller, and when our worlds  <br/>
are smaller, our children&#39;s worlds are smaller.<br/>
