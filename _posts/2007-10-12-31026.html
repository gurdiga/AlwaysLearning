<div id="ygrps-yiv-1626722863">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
We are hoping that a family of unschoolers wants to have an adventure <br/>
and come stay at our house and take care of our pets (dogs, cats, <br/>
snake, fish) from mid-April til mid-May next year.<br/>
We live in a 3 BR house in  Benson, a small town in AZ, about 40 <br/>
miles from Tucson, on 5 acres in the desert. You may be able to use <br/>
our car if you need it.<br/>
April - May is the best time of year here: beautiful weather and the <br/>
desert in bloom!<br/>
<br/>
If your family is interested, please email me off-list at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:arbinsy@...">arbinsy@...</a>. Please forward this to any local lists you might be <br/>
on also.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If a family makes this deal and needs to pass through Albuquerque to  <br/>
get there, you can stay at our house on the way!<br/>
