<div id="ygrps-yiv-921055286">I went looking for an online text or at least a publication date for the <br/>
little pamphlet from which I quoted in the bit about maturity/sobriety.<br/>
<br/>
I am still looking, and might not find it, but I came across something <br/>
interesting.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a Rod and Staff publication, and that is put out by Anabaptists, <br/>
Mennonites.   It was from a Mennonite family I got the tract.<br/>
<br/>
On the bio page of something I read because the guy has the same name as <br/>
someone my husband works with (not the same guy, I was relieved to find), there <br/>
was a list of his beliefs.   Some seemed excitingly contradictory to me, the <br/>
first and last of this subset of his beliefs:<br/>
<br/>
*   Christians have no business in earthly politics--voting, running for <br/>
office, endorsing candidates, debating political issues, protesting, signing <br/>
petitions, (in most cases, even) writing letters.<br/>
<br/>
*   Life begins at conception.<br/>
<br/>
*   Abortion is murder.<br/>
<br/>
*   Scientific fooling with the process of human conception, while <br/>
fascinating, opens too many ethical-moral dilemmas in too many scenarios.<br/>
<br/>
*   Capital punishment is the State&#39;s God-given responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
--------------<br/>
<br/>
If God is giving the state a responsibility to take life, <br/>
how then is the state &quot;earthly politics&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
So as illogical as that seems, this guy&#39;s in the business of promoting <br/>
sobriety and quietness to children.<br/>
He runs a private school.   I guess critical thinking is probably NOT on <br/>
their curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
They have an iesources that are available on it!! Much of what can be found <br/>
would fall in the amoral category. However, we all know that the enemy of <br/>
mankind continues to introduce monstrous amounts of immoral and evil stuff. So I <br/>
decided to join those in the service of the King of Kings who are striving to <br/>
make available material which is moral, safe, healthful and edifying.<br/>
<br/>
I certainly do not make a wholesale recommendation that God&#39;s people go <br/>
on-line. And those that are on-line I encourage to faithfulness. In our home <br/>
congregation, some of us modem-ites have signed the following covenant (a totally <br/>
personal, non-congregational move): <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I purpose before God and my Brothers to never use my modem to intentionally <br/>
download or view any file (text or graphic) that is sexual, pornographic, <br/>
obscene, immoral and/or lustful in nature. I also purpose to avoid newsgroups and <br/>
mailing lists which disseminate similar material. By signing this covenant of <br/>
Brotherhood accountability, I give my co-signing Brothers the privilege and <br/>
responsibility of checking up on my faithfulness in this area.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Quite a number of you &quot;out there&quot; have written to me to let me know that you <br/>
have also bound yourself with this covenant. If you, too, take this vow before <br/>
God, I&#39;d be delighted to hear from you via email.</div>

What if you were seeking an overview of medical information for a sexual<br/>
problem or STD? What if you were looking for graphics of sexual reproduction<br/>
(like genes dividing) to explain the basics of genetics for someone? <br/>
<br/>
I guess I think there is vast gulf between the word &quot;sexual&quot; and the words<br/>
&quot;pornographic&quot; and &quot;obscene&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure I want someone else defining those words for me either. I would<br/>
like a clearer definition of the grey areas before placing myself in a<br/>
situation of having someone pointing their fingers (or their modems) at me.<br/>
What if I&#39;m looking at an online underwear catalogue so that I can buy<br/>
something that will amuse dh and myself? Is one of the brotherhood who only<br/>
likes cotton grannypants going to (ahem) bust me?<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;I think it&#39;s important to give the same respect and tolerance to these <br/>

<br/>
I think it would immoral and integrity killing for me to respect and tolerate <br/>
child abusers and those who teach others to abuse.  My beliefs were called <br/>
&quot;Satan&#39;s last thrust&quot; in that pamphlet.   I don&#39;t believe in Satan or hell or <br/>
heaven, and so I can&#39;t respect people who write &quot;The rod will enable him to see <br/>
his need of a Saviour and Master.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If a person says &quot;I respect all beliefs equally,&quot; I don&#39;t think the person is <br/>
very smart.   I&#39;m certainly not interested in being friends, because it means <br/>
both these things:<br/>
<br/>
-I don&#39;t like to think hard thoughts.<br/>
-I respect you no more than I respect Charles Manson or Pol Pot.  I make no d<br/>
istinction between Ghandi and Jack the Ripper.<br/>

&lt;&lt; &#39;m thinking of Anabaptists, Amish, Mennonites, and, specifically, Rod and <br/>
Staff curriculum users/sellers. I live in a predominately Amish/Mennonite <br/>
community, and a lot of them are homeschoolers, many of whom use or have used Rod <br/>
and Staff. There are a lot of things that are not in the Bible that are <br/>
important to these people, such as tradition (wedding, funeral, etc.), gathering <br/>
together for meals, family first, etc.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They will find Biblical justification for all that, easily.  Even less <br/>
extreme fundamentalists (Southern Baptists) do so.  <br/>
<br/>
Another of the set of pamphlets I picked up says &quot;In His Holy Word, God has <br/>
spoken on every subjct that concerns us.&quot;  I was taught that in church too, <br/>
though, that there is no subject the Bible doesn&#39;t cover.  If it&#39;s not in the <br/>
Bible, it&#39;s not something for us to concern ourselves with.  If we find the need <br/>
to concern ourselves, we will find a Bible verse to cover it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Almost all of the Anabaptists and Mennonites I know are the sweetest, <br/>

<br/>
Well, their wills are broken, and they consider that to be good.  They&#39;re not <br/>
being sweet to impress you.    They&#39;re being sweet and gentle (quiet) out of <br/>
the fear of God.  They&#39;re told not to raise their voices.  Spanking HARD is <br/>
okay, the younger the better, but raising a voice is not.<br/>
<br/>
Children&#39;s wills are to be broken, and women&#39;s wills are to be broken, <br/>
according to this literature, provided by Mennonites to homeschoolers last month.<br/>

<br/>
FWIW the history of religion in America (specifically evangelicalism in its<br/>
many forms) might give some perspective here.  Often there will be an issue<br/>
that theologians would consider &quot;non-essential doctrine&quot; which becomes a pet<br/>
topic for some people within a group.  I think discipline of children is<br/>
such a topic now within Protestantism.  The more unbending, stiff and strict<br/>
the sect, the more vitriolic the rhetoric may become.  I am sure there is<br/>
not agreement even within the groups you mention on this issue.  Those who<br/>
are yelling and bullying are more obvious than those quietly living their<br/>
own family&#39;s values, so your experience with your neighbors is very nice to<br/>
hear since we mostly hear from those who are shocking or trying to change<br/>
people&#39;s minds.  For those interested in a little reading I would recommend<br/>
The Transformation of American Quakerism :  Orthodox Friends, 1800-1907   by<br/>
Thomas D. Hamm.  Not a book on children but a very interesting look at the<br/>
forces inside and outside a society and how mores and practices were<br/>
influenced and changed.  It also gives a sidelong look at the history of<br/>
evangelical churches in this country including fundamentalism and what used<br/>
to be called pentacostalism.  I see a lot of unnecessary repeating of<br/>
history in the ranks of  many Christians. I also see many wise ones who are<br/>
not so easily taken in by charlatans selling beating sticks.</div>

Again, this is a generalization. My Amish neighbors do not believe in spanking. They are pacifists across the board. My Mennonite neighbors do not believe in spanking. They are pacifists to the point of not allowing squirt guns in their house. They are also pro-life across the board. No abortion, no capital punishment.<br/>

Whether one agrees or not, when a homeschooling family is distributing free <br/>
pamphlets at a homeschooling conference, they are aiding, abetting, colluding <br/>
and supporting the beliefs put forth in those pamphlets.<br/>

No, I can make it a quote from the Rod and Staff literature sitting on the <br/>

Being pacifist isn&#39;t the same as not believing in spanking.   Just because <br/>
they don&#39;t spank where you know about it doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t believe in it.<br/>
<br/>
My contributions were comments directly from literature distributed free to <br/>
all kinds of homeschoolers by a Mennonite family at a homeschooling conference <br/>
in June, 2004.  it&#39;s not about what the grandmothers might have believed and <br/>
passed down.  It&#39;s detailed recommendation from Rod and Staff, being <br/>
distributed today.<br/>
<br/>
Why do you think they have a whole curriculum called &quot;Rod and Staff&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;For more info, I offer this website:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://parentinginjesusfootsteps.org/">http://parentinginjesusfootsteps.org/</a>&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not an Anabaptist or Mennonite website.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s lots of spanking reference and links:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/spanking">http://sandradodd.com/spanking</a><br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t change the text of these pamphlets.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, Rod and Staff doesn&#39;t have a website, so even the pamphlets <br/>
have to be ordered by phone or mail (or you can pick them up free at <br/>
homeschooling conferences), but what I&#39;ve quoted from were these:<br/>
<br/>
The Responsibilites of Parents in Teaching and Training Their Children<br/>
Powers of the New Age<br/>
<br/>
What I hadn&#39;t quoted from yet:<br/>
<br/>
The Unequal Yoke and Related Dangers in Education <br/>
(which says they consider this to be going against God&#39;s will:) &quot;...working <br/>
with unScriptural groups in evangelism or peace efforts.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They love peace, but not enough to join with people outside their own narrow <br/>
definition of &quot;Scriptual&quot; to achieve it)<br/>
<br/>
The Veiling, a Symbol of Divine Order<br/>
which has this kind of logic:<br/>
&quot;A veiled woman has power on her head.  Power means &#39;privilege, freedom, <br/>
delegated influence and authority.&#39;  A woman in her place, under the authority of <br/>
man, has privilege, freedom and authority, of which a woman out of her place <br/>
knows nothing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
[One doesn&#39;t have to look far to find that belief, minus the veiling (cap, in <br/>
the case of this group).  LOTS of homeschoolers say the father is the <br/>
principal and the mother is the teacher, in reference to homeschooling, and they cite <br/>
the Bible.]<br/>
<br/>
God&#39;s Standard for Educating Our Children<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The teaching of self-expression is in complete opposition to Bible <br/>
principles.  It militates against a life of obedience and submission.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So in saying people shouldn&#39;t talk about what they don&#39;t know, you&#39;re <br/>
defending people you casually see in public and at the same time assuming I didn&#39;t <br/>
have any idea about the beliefs of fundamentalist Christians.   And I wasn&#39;t <br/>
even working from a fair-sized lump of personal experience and knowledge, but <br/>
quoting from pamphlets I&#39;ve had a month.<br/>

&lt;&lt;This is actually not true. Be careful! It&#39;s easy to generalize and make <br/>
assumptions about things we don&#39;t understand. I think it&#39;s important to give the <br/>
same respect and tolerance to these groups as we would expect for ourselves.  <br/>

<br/>
The question was originally not about the pamphlets (sorry) but about the <br/>
quotes from Mark Roth&#39;s page (he was a missionary, child of missionaries, now is <br/>
running a Christian school and doing his missionary work on the internet).<br/>
<br/>
The question was specifically about his internet pact which people in his own <br/>
congregation agree to and my comments (which were humorous, yet true, <br/>
addressed to someone who was asking honest yet purposely in-context-crazy questions) <br/>
were about that one congregation and their internet pact, which I had just <br/>
read about at some length.<br/>
<br/>
So to say I was generalizing and making an untrue statement wasn&#39;t correct.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-113814484">&lt;&lt;No, I can make it a quote from the Rod and Staff literature sitting on the desk here if you want me to.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I am familiar with Rod and Staff, and yes, they do believe in corporal punishment. However, Rod and Staff do not represent all Anabaptists. Actually, Anabaptist is a generic term:<br/>
<br/>
  Anabaptist is from the Greek [ana] meaning again, and [baptismos] meaning baptism. i.e., to re-baptize. The anabaptists were a radical sect that prospered during the start of the Reformation (1520-1580) who taught that infants should not be baptized, denied predestination, and believed that Christ had a celestial flesh, and He did not develop from the mortal flesh of Mary. <br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of groups that fall under the Anabaptist category. Amish and Mennonite are the two that I know of personally. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;That&#39;s not an Anabaptist or Mennonite website.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, it&#39;s not. This was in reference to Krisula&#39;s post, which I quoted above the link, and her reference to Protestantism. Actually, the Lawrence&#39;s don&#39;t give any indication what denomination they are, other than that they are Christians.<br/>

<br/>
Actually, no. These are personal friends and next-door neighbors. I&#39;m not<br/>
assuming anything about you. I was simply saying that the statement that the<br/>
only thing important to Anabaptists are what is in the Bible is not true. I<br/>
simply wanted to clarify a generalization. The original comment to which I<br/>
was responding was:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;-=-What if you were looking for graphics of sexual reproduction<br/>
(like genes dividing) to explain the basics of genetics for someone? -=-<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s not in the Bible, it&#39;s not important to them.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And I simply stated that this is not true, if you&#39;re talking about<br/>
Anabaptists/Mennonites/Amish in general. I know many people who have<br/>
attended EMU or other Mennonite Universities, and they study many things,<br/>
not just what&#39;s in the Bible. Amish children attend school until 8th grade,<br/>
and they learn a lot of things that are discussed in the Bible.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying that Rod and Staff members do not believe in these tenants<br/>
you&#39;ve listed. I&#39;m not saying that there are Mennonites who believe these<br/>
things. I&#39;m simply clarifying that not all Anabaptists practice the type of<br/>
lifestyles that Rod and Staff Publications does.<br/>

<br/>
Then I apologize. When you asked me of what group I was thinking specifically, &quot;What do you mean? And of what group are you thinking?&quot; I clarified by saying that I was thinking specifically of Mennonites/Amish Anabaptists, since that is the group you specifically mentioned when you said that the Bible was the only important thing to them and that amusement was Satanic. I wanted to clarify that not ALL Anabaptists feel as the Rod and Staff people do and many of them are very good people. On the converse, there are many Amish/Mennonite people who are not &quot;Christian&quot; at all.<br/>
