<div id="ygrps-yiv-243728940">I couldn&#39;t figure out which tv email to reply to, so I thought I&#39;d  <br/>
throw this out there, because it relates to the whole topic, I think.<br/>
<br/>
Many people will refer to a saying about love, and how it expands to  <br/>
fit the situation.  For example, if you have more babies, you just  <br/>
experience or &quot;create&quot; more love.<br/>
<br/>
It just dawned on me as I was reading through all of the tv thread,  <br/>
that lots of people look at learning as a zero-sum game, and that  <br/>
there is a limited amount of learning potential, hence if tv is a  <br/>
something you spend time on, it must be cutting something else out.<br/>
<br/>
On the contrary, we&#39;ve found that learning is expansive, like love.   <br/>
Opening ourselves up to tv has allowed us to learn more, not less,  <br/>
and it has drawn so much more information into our lives, that the  <br/>
learning is exponentially increased.<br/>
<br/>
We had to be open to that thought, however, for it to happen.  The  <br/>
learning and engagement never would have happened if we simply  <br/>
&quot;allowed&quot; television and did not engage and learn ourselves from it  <br/>
as adults.  Interestingly, learning to love tv has translated into a  <br/>
much greater ability to identify and focus deeply on areas of  <br/>
interest outside of television.  When we became focused on seeing the  <br/>
learning in something that &quot;seemed&quot; to have no learning involved, we  <br/>
became more astute at identifying interests and opportunities for  <br/>
learning everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I think that there is a sort of &quot;methodology&quot; that seasoned  <br/>
unschoolers have developed of linking information from one media to  <br/>
another (i.e., following up on a tv show/movie interest with research  <br/>
on the web, finding related products or real world events/activities,  <br/>
books, clippings), that is a pattern of learning and seeking out  <br/>
information/input, that is an incredibly powerful pattern for young  <br/>
kids to see and learn.  Not to mention, it&#39;s incredibly FUN!!!<br/>
<br/>
The more we open up, the more interests flood in, the more  <br/>
connections there are, the more we put on our to do list, the more we  <br/>
seek out real world connections to what we&#39;ve viewed, the more books  <br/>
we read, etc, etc, etc.<br/>

<br/>
I totally agree with this assessment.  I&#39;d also add that television, <br/>
like it or not, is so central to contemporary existence that not <br/>
knowing how to &quot;read&quot; television (and filmed things in general) is <br/>
roughly equivalent to not being able to read texts.  Even if, for <br/>
example, I don&#39;t watch TV, all of the people around me do.  Their <br/>
language is influenced by it, their knowledge or lack of knowledge of <br/>
the world is mediated by it, their narratives are informed by it, and <br/>
their interactions are molded by it.  I feel that in order to <br/>
understand the world in which they live and the people with whom they <br/>
live, my children need to be able to read TV at a very high level.<br/>
<br/>
Watching television together, and watching it suspiciously, is an <br/>
excellent way, I&#39;ve found, to help young people understand the power of <br/>
images, the function of propoganda, the way stories get told to benefit <br/>
someone other than the person hearing/watching the story.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1213151864">Aw, JEEZ, no, Kelly,--you said &quot;methodology.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I loved your whole post.  LOVED it expansively.  Learned from it  <br/>
expansively. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I want to put it in a prominent place linked from the TV page and  <br/>
learning and unschooling.  It should be required reading in advance  <br/>
of anyone joining this group.  Yeah.  And I want a pre-test, too, so  <br/>
I can PROVE to people they&#39;ve learned something from being on this  <br/>
list (after they take their second and third tests for  <br/>
comparison!)    ***JUST JOKING about the last part.***<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-Also, I think that there is a sort of &quot;methodology&quot; that seasoned<br/>
unschoolers have developed of linking information from one media to<br/>
another (i.e., following up on a tv show/movie interest with research<br/>
on the web, finding related products or real world events/activities,<br/>
books, clippings), that is a pattern of learning and seeking out<br/>
information/input, that is an incredibly powerful pattern for young<br/>
kids to see and learn. Not to mention, it&#39;s incredibly FUN!!!-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a methodology that has developed.<br/>
I did that all my life.  When I was a kid in the Beatlemania days, I  <br/>
collected all I could about The Beatles, read all I could, had (still  <br/>
have) the albums.  Bought all the 45s (and sold them, with their  <br/>
paper covers, to a collector around 1980).  From and because of that  <br/>
I was interested in looking into things related to their childhoods  <br/>
and interests, and so I knew, because I knew John Lennon&#39;s birthday,  <br/>
that London was being bombed then.  Big tie-in to WWII.  I learned  <br/>
more about India, though I already knew some, and a few years later  <br/>
had an Indian boyfriend for four years.  I got to meet Ravi Shankar,  <br/>
through that, and thought &quot;Cool; he met the Beatles!&quot;  I think I  <br/>
could write for days straight about connections I made from my  <br/>
interest in The Beatles.<br/>
<br/>
So...<br/>
I didn&#39;t develop that.  I let it flow through my life.  I flowed  <br/>
along with it.<br/>
<br/>
If parents can learn to play, to take joy, to be easily amused, to  <br/>
unleash their curiosity, they will find themselves in a flow that&#39;s  <br/>
always been happening, always been available, but our upbringing and  <br/>
stodgy friends and relatives and school training and all told us to  <br/>
turn away from it, not to be distracted, to &quot;grow up.&quot;<br/>

In <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/deschooling">http://sandradodd.com/deschooling</a> I wrote<br/>
<br/>
-=-Weird Al says it a different way in “Everything You Know is  <br/>
Wrong,” and Christians say “You must surrender yourself.” Before that  <br/>
Jesus said, “Unless you become as a little child…”<br/>
<br/>
-=-What it means in homeschooling terms is that as long as you think  <br/>
you can control and add to what you already know, it will be hard to  <br/>
come to unschooling. The more quickly you empty your cup and open  <br/>
yourself to new ideas uncritically, the sooner you will see natural  <br/>
learning blossom.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When that was translated into French, the translator left out the  <br/>
part about Jesus.  She said in France, references to Jesus like that,  <br/>
outside of church, are very unpopular.  I&#39;ve kept that in mind and a  <br/>
couple of times have noticed it in movies or writings about France.   <br/>
They DO have a different take on it, and since the revolution at  <br/>
least (maybe longer).<br/>

pause and run off to check things on IMDB or MemoryAlpha (the Star Trek <br/>

sources; we watch connectedly :-)<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s how we watch too... and listen to music and it&#39;s just what we do.  We connect, connect, connect.  I think it&#39;s what human&#39;s brains do, if allowed ;)<br/>
<br/>
Just earlier this morning Abbi (soon to be 13) was working on the laptop and she had her new playlist going from her blog.  Bruce Springsteen&#39;s Dancing in the Dark came up and Courtney Cox&#39;s image came to my mind. &lt;g&gt;  After the song was done, we got Youtube up and found his live performance with her debut dance in it.  Pretty fun.  That&#39;s just a beginning or maybe a middle of connections, Abbi knew Cox from Adam Sandler&#39;s Longest Yard and we had connections from that movie to the old Longest Yard to Burt Reynolds (who was in both).<br/>
<br/>
Just recently we were on a connections ride which actually led to a touch on to the Riot Act that Sandra mentioned and continued to the French Impressionists and French History.  It all came from us liking (OK, obsessing over ;)  Richard Armitage,  the Britsh actor.<br/>
<br/>
It all started when I thought I&#39;d try a new series I heard of from Netflix.  It&#39;s BBC&#39;s Robin Hood 2006.  We&#39;ve liked other Robin Hood&#39;s and heard this one was fun.  Well, we loved it and ended up buying the first season.  Abbi really liked Richard Armitage in it and wondered if there was anything else with him in.  She and I both looked on Netflix, IMDB  and found BBC&#39;s North and South.  We were happy to see that we could watch it immediately from Netflix.  If you didn&#39;t know, Netflix now has an option to watch some shows right on your computer, immediate downloads, and it&#39;s in addition to your monthly ones.<br/>
<br/>
So.. we got &#39;North and South&#39; which told the story of a woman going from a countryside life to a town life and it touches on the industrial changes in 19th century England.  Well, we still weren&#39;t done with wanting more of Mr. Armitage, so we also put &#39;The Impressionists&#39; on the queue and watched it when it arrived.  That was also a great show.<br/>
<br/>
So we started with Robin Hood, continued to 19th century England and ended.. for now (although it&#39;s never really ended because the connections will continue) with the impressionists artists.<br/>
<br/>
Very cool.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, that&#39;s us too!  For example, when we got our satellite radio, the kids<br/>
discovered Elvis.  My mom and I are already crazy about Elvis, and now all<br/>
four of our kids are, especially the girls.  We have been in an intense<br/>
Elvis phase for probably the last year, all Elvis all the time in the car.<br/>
We listen to the Elvis Quiz Show on Fridays and the kids try to guess the<br/>
song snippets.  They&#39;ve decided they want to go be on the Elvis Quiz Show.<br/>
We&#39;ve used our TiVo to search and record Elvis movies and documentaries and<br/>
they&#39;ve learned all about his life.  We listen to George Klein interview<br/>
various Elvis friends, and get to see glimpses into the lives of these other<br/>
people.  They have listened many times to the Million Dollar Quartet sing<br/>
and sometimes point out one of the other singers when he hear one of their<br/>
songs.<br/>
<br/>
It has given them an extra connection to their grandma, who lives in Little<br/>
Rock and has begun making treks to Graceland for trinkets for them and who<br/>
gave them her much prized ticket stub from an Elvis concert.  When we go to<br/>
Little Rock for Thanksgiving, we will surely go to Graceland for a tour.<br/>
It&#39;s connected them with a family friend, who actually used to live behind<br/>
Graceland when Elvis first moved there.  (And amazingly she didn&#39;t throw<br/>
herself over the back fence to borrow sugar!)<br/>
<br/>
This summer, my daughter and son had a shared birthday party (their<br/>
birthdays are two days apart and they chose to share a party) and the party<br/>
was an Elvis party.  I wrote Argo from the Elvis radio channel to see if he<br/>
could email them a happy birthday, and he wrote back that he&#39;d rather call<br/>
and wish them happy birthday!  Even better, their party happened to be on<br/>
the day when the Elvis channel was celebrating three years on air and was<br/>
having a special quiz show.  Since we&#39;d planned to have our own Elvis quiz<br/>
show, we just put the radio&#39;s quiz show on for the party, and the DJs called<br/>
out to our two birthday kids, saying &quot;Isabella and Jake love Elvis and are<br/>
having an Elvis party right now while we&#39;re having one.&quot;  It was so<br/>
exciting.  And all of our friends have enjoyed being on the periphery of the<br/>
Elvis craze.  Some have brought their Elvis movies out of their boxes and<br/>
loaned them to the girls or watched them with the kids.  This Halloween all<br/>
four kids want to dress &quot;Elvis.&quot;  My older son wants to be Elvis as a<br/>
soldier.  My daughter wants to be Priscilla, and the other two want to be<br/>
other versions of Elvis.  <br/>
<br/>
They also love spotting other Elvis influences on TV - in Lilo and Stitch,<br/>
on the Dollywood commercial.  One kid saw a commercial for wheeled sneakers<br/>
and commented that his song &quot;Wheels on my Heels&quot; would have been a good song<br/>
for the commercial.  We&#39;ve enjoyed browsing YouTube and listening to Lisa<br/>
Marie sing a duet &quot;Don&#39;t Cry Daddy&quot; with Elvis (obviously digitally blended<br/>
into his song).<br/>
<br/>
There have been so many fun blendings of all of these different sources and<br/>
Kelly is right, it is definitley an expansive and wonderful experience.<br/>

Too much gullibility isn&#39;t great, either, but &quot;suspicious&quot; goes too  <br/>

And, every product sold is being sold for the benefit of the seller -  <br/>
to earn a profit, that&#39;s how our economy works. The profit motive is  <br/>

This is a link to something Amy Carpenter wrote about active  <br/>
learning.   It starts off this way:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A mom wrote:<br/>
<br/>
== He watched South Park, listens to music on his ipod, plays video  <br/>
games on his xbox but has NO INTEREST in learning even the basics.==<br/>
==They seem to want passive stimulation.==<br/>
<br/>
Amy Carpenter responded:<br/>
<br/>
Seeing TV and video games as passive stimulation is becoming a very  <br/>
foreign concept to me.<br/>
My husband majored in Communication Arts and Sciences, with a focus  <br/>
on Video Production when he was an undergrad. From our early days  <br/>
together, he was always pointing out *how* TV shows and movies were  <br/>
made�how the perspective was framed, how the editing decisions worked  <br/>
with the overarching philosophy, as well as &quot;how did they get that  <br/>
shot?&quot; questions. That&#39;s part of our everyday conversation when my  <br/>
family watches TV together.<br/>
<br/>
As a writer, I&#39;m always looking at the story behind the story as  <br/>
well....<br/>

working on making movies, and studying the ways special effects were <br/>
done...it&#39;s really a different experience for my kids to watch a <br/>
movie than it was for me as a child.  I was scared of the wicked <br/>
witch on the Wizard of Oz, and would pull my feet up off the floor, <br/>
because I was scared to think of the open space under the couch. They <br/>
talk about the ways the effects were done, and whether they were done <br/>
well or not.  One of our most used lines right now is &quot;Why did they <br/>
DO that?&quot;  &quot;It&#39;s in the script!&quot;  (Totally kills the &quot;movie magic&quot; <br/>
thing, though.  When you KNOW Superman is standing on a board in <br/>
front of a blue screen, it makes it look different.  LOL)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-101060690">Oh gosh, yes, I could have used a different word, for example &quot;style&quot;  <br/>
or &quot;approach,&quot; even &quot;flair&quot; or some other better word that I can&#39;t  <br/>
think of now.  I realize that it&#39;s not a methodology that has  <br/>
developed, but maybe it&#39;s a pattern that home learners are more  <br/>
likely to fall into?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe lots of other unschoolers have come with this kind of wiring,  <br/>
but it was not really part of my style, so a lot of it has been  <br/>
learned and positive reinforcement for me.  As a child, I can&#39;t  <br/>
recall a situation of being totally into something and learning about  <br/>
it in such a deep way.  I was more likely to read one of my favorite  <br/>
books over again, or listen to my favorite album for the 900th time.   <br/>
As a young adult, I was more likely to dabble in things too, which  <br/>
might be just a style sort of thing.  Work was probably the first  <br/>
place where I learned more about getting into something in really  <br/>
great depth.  (Funny, years of school did not create that incentive  <br/>
for me, but my work did.)<br/>
<br/>
Now we can be dabblers AND deep learners in our home, which is so  <br/>
cool : )<br/>
<br/>
One last thing which I feel is important to communicate.  We did not  <br/>
love tv from the beginning.  Although I absolutely adored film, and  <br/>
spent much of my 20&#39;s in old Chicago movie-houses watching  <br/>
independent films, we definitely came from the &quot;it&#39;s a tool to be  <br/>
managed&quot; mindset as parents, and could have easily gone down the path  <br/>
of increasingly limiting shows/time, etc (funny, in hindsight, that I  <br/>
might have wanted to restrict something that my kids would naturally  <br/>
be drawn to).  I think it has been helpful for me to see the cases  <br/>
where people have gone from one mindset to another, and I&#39;d be happy  <br/>
to post more details on our experience if people are interested.   <br/>
Actually we&#39;ve done that in almost every area.  Not that we were  <br/>
evilly restrictive parents, but we didn&#39;t necessarily question  <br/>
traditional parenting choices in the beginning.  I think that&#39;s so  <br/>
critical to say, because it&#39;s easy for me to shout &quot;I LOVE TV&quot; from  <br/>
the mountaintops now, but it might be helpful for others earlier (or  <br/>
even later) on the path to know that not every really happy convinced  <br/>
unschooler starts out that way, and it really is possible to go  <br/>
through dramatic change in your thinking.<br/>

&gt; Aw, JEEZ, no, Kelly,--you said &quot;methodology.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I loved your whole post.  LOVED it expansively.  Learned from it<br/>
&gt; expansively. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I want to put it in a prominent place linked from the TV page and<br/>
&gt; learning and unschooling.  It should be required reading in advance<br/>
&gt; of anyone joining this group.  Yeah.  And I want a pre-test, too, so<br/>
&gt; I can PROVE to people they&#39;ve learned something from being on this<br/>
&gt; list (after they take their second and third tests for<br/>
&gt; comparison!)    ***JUST JOKING about the last part.***<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -=-Also, I think that there is a sort of &quot;methodology&quot; that seasoned<br/>
&gt; unschoolers have developed of linking information from one media to<br/>
&gt; another (i.e., following up on a tv show/movie interest with research<br/>
&gt; on the web, finding related products or real world events/activities,<br/>
&gt; books, clippings), that is a pattern of learning and seeking out<br/>
&gt; information/input, that is an incredibly powerful pattern for young<br/>
&gt; kids to see and learn. Not to mention, it&#39;s incredibly FUN!!!-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a methodology that has developed.<br/>
&gt; I did that all my life.  When I was a kid in the Beatlemania days, I<br/>
&gt; collected all I could about The Beatles, read all I could, had (still<br/>
&gt; have) the albums.  Bought all the 45s (and sold them, with their<br/>
&gt; paper covers, to a collector around 1980).  From and because of that<br/>
&gt; I was interested in looking into things related to their childhoods<br/>
&gt; and interests, and so I knew, because I knew John Lennon&#39;s birthday,<br/>
&gt; that London was being bombed then.  Big tie-in to WWII.  I learned<br/>
&gt; more about India, though I already knew some, and a few years later<br/>
&gt; had an Indian boyfriend for four years.  I got to meet Ravi Shankar,<br/>
&gt; through that, and thought &quot;Cool; he met the Beatles!&quot;  I think I<br/>
&gt; could write for days straight about connections I made from my<br/>
&gt; interest in The Beatles.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So...<br/>
&gt; I didn&#39;t develop that.  I let it flow through my life.  I flowed<br/>
&gt; along with it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If parents can learn to play, to take joy, to be easily amused, to<br/>
&gt; unleash their curiosity, they will find themselves in a flow that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; always been happening, always been available, but our upbringing and<br/>
&gt; stodgy friends and relatives and school training and all told us to<br/>
&gt; turn away from it, not to be distracted, to &quot;grow up.&quot;<br/>

&gt; That might help.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/deschooling">http://sandradodd.com/deschooling</a> I wrote<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -=-Weird Al says it a different way in “Everything You Know is<br/>
&gt; Wrong,” and Christians say “You must surrender yourself.” Before that<br/>
&gt; Jesus said, “Unless you become as a little child…”<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -=-What it means in homeschooling terms is that as long as you think<br/>
&gt; you can control and add to what you already know, it will be hard to<br/>
&gt; come to unschooling. The more quickly you empty your cup and open<br/>
&gt; yourself to new ideas uncritically, the sooner you will see natural<br/>
&gt; learning blossom.-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When that was translated into French, the translator left out the<br/>
&gt; part about Jesus.  She said in France, references to Jesus like that,<br/>
&gt; outside of church, are very unpopular.  I&#39;ve kept that in mind and a<br/>
&gt; couple of times have noticed it in movies or writings about France.<br/>
&gt; They DO have a different take on it, and since the revolution at<br/>
&gt; least (maybe longer).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Let your thoughts and your actions flow.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1105796033">I don&#39;t really know all the history and cause of restrictions.  I  <br/>
don&#39;t guess anyone does, but I figured we could share what we do know  <br/>
and brainstorm some.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
This made me think of a few things.   One is the saying from the  <br/>
hippie 60&#39;s, &quot;If it feels good, do it.&quot;<br/>
No one would have had reason to say or think any such thing if they  <br/>
weren&#39;t emerging from a culture that clearly said &quot;If it feels good,  <br/>
it&#39;s a sin.&quot;    And they said:<br/>
&quot;If it tastes bad, it must be good for you.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Work isn&#39;t supposed to fun.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It also made me think of the claim (never said in a sympathetic way,  <br/>
but when I&#39;ve heard it it&#39;s always had that sharp tone of  <br/>
disapproval) that people &quot;crave&quot; what they&#39;re allergic to.<br/>
<br/>
I think there have been millions of parents (and teachers and public  <br/>
officials) who have seen someone&#39;s eyes light up, and they step in to  <br/>
separate them by any means from that thing that lit them up.  I think  <br/>
there still are some.  Millions, still.  I saw it a lot when I was  <br/>
young, in the 50&#39;s, and heard the bad tone with which it was discussed.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it looks like jealousy.<br/>
Sometimes in the past it has been justified as saving their souls,  <br/>
keeping them from sin.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-837783287">I mentioned a couple of months ago about our weaving various tangents of<br/>
Elvis interests, thanks to my girls&#39; year-long fascination with him, and<br/>
that I was taking them to visit Graceland in November to be on the Elvis<br/>
Quiz Show.  Well, the girls won! (We played as a 3-generational team of<br/>
grandma, me, the girls, but every answer my mom and I contributed was wrong<br/>
so the win was purely thanks to the girls.)  They beat two other teams of<br/>
adults and got to be guest DJs, which entailed being interviewed and getting<br/>
to determine the play list for that period. The most thrilling moment for me<br/>
was when the DJ was asking them about homeschooling.  He asked &quot;who teaches<br/>
you, your mom?&quot; and they said &quot;No we teach ourselves.&quot;  He was surprised and<br/>
made some really positive comments about how neat that must be.  We had such<br/>
a fun time - I got us rooms at the Heartbreak Hotel and took them to supper<br/>
at the Rock n Roll Café.  They got to meet George Klein, Elvis&#39;s high school<br/>
friend and former member of the Memphis Mafia, and the kids got to see an<br/>
evening Elvis impersonator show, which was a blast. They have come away with<br/>
even more tangents and some amazing memories.<br/>
<br/>
Big Jim Sykes, the DJ, gave us a CD copy of the quiz show and guest DJ spot<br/>
and once I check to see if we have permission to upload it, I will provide a<br/>
link in case anyone wants that unschooling comment and reaction.<br/>
