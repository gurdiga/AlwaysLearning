<div id="ygrps-yiv-1637041851">After years of avoiding Shakespeare because I had to read and memorize LOTS of it in high school, on Sandra&#39;s recommendation, I Netflixed The Reduced Shakespeare Company and laughed &#39;til I cried. Actually peed my pants. (Getting old sucks...and can be damp. &lt;G&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One of the few Shakespeare plays I had *not* read was Titus Andronicus, but the RSC piqued my interest. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I Netflixed that a week or two ago. I popped it in the DVD player, and both my boys wandered in after about 10-20 minutes into it and sat all the way through with me, mesmerized. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Interesting story...revenge. &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Interesting story...revenge. &lt;G&gt;-=-<br/>
<br/>
Now, see?<br/>
I didn&#39;t like that video (Anthony Hopkins one) and didn&#39;t finish it. I  <br/>
give myself permission to quit something even if it&#39;s something I have  <br/>
already declared and known for sure that I like!<br/>
<br/>
I like musicals, but I don&#39;t like Oklahoma, and haven&#39;t been able to  <br/>
get all the way through it.  I don&#39;t like South Pacific, and ditto;  <br/>
can&#39;t make it through it.  If I saw it in person, and there was social  <br/>
expectation and I knew someone in the cast and we were all going to go  <br/>
eat later, and the ticket had cost money, then maybe I could sit  <br/>
through, but it would be a little like going to the dentist.   But  <br/>
there are lots of musicals I&#39;m crazy about and I DO love the genre in  <br/>
general, and I loved seeing JC Superstar locally where Judas was acted  <br/>
as a south-valley cholo.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe saying &quot;I like musicals&quot; is too much like a kid saying &quot;I like  <br/>
math&quot; and then discovering that there are mathematical ideas or  <br/>
projects or applications that don&#39;t interest him whatsoever.  Someone  <br/>
might LOVE like crazy astronomy and optics and physics and not give  <br/>
one little rat&#39;s patootie about botany.  Ooops.  Then does he love  <br/>
science or not?<br/>
<br/>
So what I&#39;m saying is...<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s possible to love Much Ado About Nothing because it&#39;s got  <br/>
actors one&#39;s interested in, or to watch Hamlet to see whether Mel  <br/>
Gibson can actually pull it off, and then forget it&#39;s Mel Gibson for  <br/>
about an hour (as I did).<br/>
<br/>
Some easy Shakespeare maybe, on video:<br/>
The Taming of the Shrew with Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor.   <br/>
Pretty easy to follow.<br/>
The late-60&#39;s Romeo and Juliet.  Pretty.<br/>
A Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream with Sam Rockwell playing a usually throw- <br/>
away part, and in the comic relief section doing something so poignant  <br/>
you might cry.<br/>
<br/>
Othello with Laurence Fishburne and Ken Branagh is well done but  <br/>
heartbreaking.  Save it for about twelfth, maybe.<br/>
But Henry V!!!  Christian Bale, as a boy, playing the boy. &lt;g&gt;   <br/>
Beautiful music.  Cast of dozens, but they pull off the Battles of  <br/>
Harfleur and Agincourt  with close-ups and smoke and dust.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1428723785">There are also some movies that are based on Shakespeare:<br/>
<br/>
Ten Things I Hate About You is based on Taming of the Shrew (I didn&#39;t really like this movie, but I know lots of people did)<br/>

O is based on Othello and is set (I think) around basketball in a high school.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1873030698">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Movies based on Shakespeare - my kids really enjoyed &quot;She&#39;s the Man&quot; based on Twelfth Night. I haven&#39;t seen &quot;12 things I hate about you&quot; but I understand it is loosely based on Taming of the Shrew.<br/>
<br/>
If you are lucky enough to know a drama coach who is inventive the teens can really enjoy acting in an abridged Shakespeare performance - last year my three aged 16, 14 and 12 were in a production of Hamlet in 10 minutes - they loved it.<br/>
<br/>
Try attending a live production - in a small theatre the kids can often join in - my daughter got to raise the moon in a production of A Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream when she was in the audience aged about 9.  Actually that is a good show to see as the comedy get them over the hump of the language.<br/>

that, Hamlet&#39;s more fun. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

You just did!  It&#39;s mentioned on one of those links I sent.  Kirby  <br/>
really liked it when he was &quot;too young&quot; to understand.  I watched him  <br/>
watch it.  He was totally following it.  I thought he&#39;d want to take a  <br/>
break, because it&#39;s long, but he politely shushed me because it was  <br/>
too interesting to consider whether to save some for later.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-849179481">I took a Shakespeare course in college, and about 50% of class time was<br/>
spent watching VHS videos of performances.  My absolute favorite, that has<br/>
stuck with me since that 1987 classroom time and still brings a smile to my<br/>
face, was The Taming of the Shrew with Marc Singer as Petruchio (btw, his<br/>
sister, Lori Singer, was the love interest in Footloose).  The professor had<br/>
to rewind many times because we were laughing so hard we were missing lots<br/>
of lines.  <br/>
<br/>
Looking at Amazon just now, it was released on DVD in 2002:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Taming-Shrew-Broadway-Theatre-Archive/dp/B00006G8HO">http://www.amazon.com/Taming-Shrew-Broadway-Theatre-Archive/dp/B00006G8HO</a><br/>
<br/>
One of the Amazon reviewers says this:<br/>
&quot;The bottom line is that if I was interested in turning young students onto<br/>
Shakespeare, in terms of the love of language and the joy in word play, then<br/>
this ACT production of &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; from the Broadway Theater<br/>
Archive would be the one I would show them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I just ordered a copy and can&#39;t wait to watch it again.  <br/>

Shakespeare, from the perspective of the court&#39;s fool.<br/>

&gt; spanking, maiming, treason, and heretofore unexplored heights of vulgarity<br/>
&gt; and profanity, as well as non-traditional grammar, spit infinitives, and the<br/>
&gt; odd wank. If that sort of thing bothers you, then gentle reader pass by, for<br/>
