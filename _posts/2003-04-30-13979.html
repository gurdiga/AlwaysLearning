&lt;&lt; Suddenly birth certificates seem so useless.  Yet that&#39;s what they base <br/>
all <br/>
 kinds of legality on from nationality (pretty important sometimes) to <br/>
 driving, passports, retirement and social security.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The place of birth, time, doctor etc.. all remains as the original. The only <br/>
thing they change is the birth parents names. For obvious reasons.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a true story though.<br/>
A friend of mine gave birth at home for all of her births. Never filed for <br/>
the birth certificates at the health department.<br/>
Well, her oldest got married a couple years ago, and had a honeymoon to <br/>
Mexico planned. Jo was trying to figure out what she should do about the <br/>
birth cert. So she decided that government beuracracy being what it is, they <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have a clue what a certificate from other places should look like, <br/>
only want to see some document that looked official.<br/>
She MADE a birth certificate on her home computer. Copied one that was real <br/>
and made it look all official.<br/>
No one questioned it EVER.<br/>
It&#39;s all a scam.<br/>
<br/>
Ren<br/>
&quot;They dined on mince, and slices of quince, Which they ate with a runcible <br/>
spoon;<br/>
And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand, they danced by the light of the <br/>
moon.&quot;<br/>

Well what the hell do they WANT then?<br/>
We had to apply for SS numbers as soon as the babies were born, using a form <br/>
the hospital gave us for that purpose.   What can we prove once we&#39;ve left <br/>
the hospital?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1456377160">OK, so what did you have to show to get a driver&#39;s license?<br/>
<br/>
I used my kid&#39;s birth certificates to get photo ID from the state licensing bureau.<br/>
<br/>
The lady at the counter asked how tall they were and how much they weighed.  I didn&#39;t know either, but the kids knew their weight.  This lady was indignant that I didn&#39;t know their height.  I said, they are growing all the time!  It makes me wonder why they don&#39;t actually measure people for driver&#39;s licenses.  I&#39;m 5&#39;2&quot;, but I wonder how far away from that I could tell them before they would question it.  Could I say 5&#39;6&quot; and they would just write it down?  My mother is now about 4&quot; shorter than she used to be, but I&#39;m sure her license doesn&#39;t reflect that change.<br/>

&lt;&lt; OK, so what did you have to show to get a driver&#39;s license?<br/>
<br/>
I used my kid&#39;s birth certificates to get photo ID from the state licensing <br/>
bureau. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When my kids got photo IDs I used birth certificates.  They wanted school <br/>
IDs, too, but I said they didn&#39;t have any.  She stared at me without blinking <br/>
for a long time as though maybe I should restate my truth so she would <br/>
recognize it and could go about her routine business.<br/>
<br/>
But Kirby just came home with a certificate.  It says it cannot be copied on <br/>
penalty of law.  I think I&#39;ll make a copy just to keep, for us and maybe for <br/>
the insurance company. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But it says that to get his provisional license he will have to have that <br/>
certificate (which says he finished driver&#39;s education, including the actual <br/>
road-driving experience), a list of 50 hours of driving signed by the <br/>
parents, his birth certificate (original) and social security card (original).<br/>
<br/>
We do actually have all that stuff (except he hasn&#39;t finished the 50 hours, <br/>
which is fine, and there&#39;s a six-month time for learner&#39;s permit too, but we <br/>
don&#39;t have to physically bring in the six months &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
Different states differ differently, doubtlessly.<br/>

<br/>
Oh!  Oh!!  I was still growing at one point in my life, and when I got a <br/>
learner&#39;s permit I was 5&#39;4&quot; so when I went in for my real license, I just <br/>
said 5&#39;5&quot; assuming NATURALLY I had grown in that time.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I hadn&#39;t.  So the next time I got it renewed I was honest and said that <br/>
should be 5&#39;4&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
So for a while I was 5&#39;5&quot; just as surely as if a judge had changed my birth <br/>
parents.  Government papers.  *LUV*<br/>
<br/>
When Keith signed up for the draft he obnoxiously put his height in inches <br/>
and his weight in kilograms (72&quot; and 108 kg.) and they didn&#39;t notice so they <br/>
put 7&#39;4&quot; and 108 lbs.  Who could draft a giraffish giant like that!?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1315146082">I had a typo on that last post; sorry.   74 (6&#39;2&quot;) inches, not 72 (6&#39;) <br/>
although I think Keith cheats there too and is only 6&#39;1.5 if he stretches.<br/>
<br/>
He had back surgery at 19 or 20, though, and he might have once been 6&#39;2 <br/>
legitimately.  I think he just said so and the driver&#39;s license people wrote <br/>
it down! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
