<div id="ygrps-yiv-1172897009">So much stuff to talk about and so little time...<br/>
First - Congratulations Sandra! on your article in the first &quot;Live <br/>
Free learn Free&quot; Magazine, I got my copy yesturday and it&#39;s looking <br/>
nice although yours was the only article I have actually had the <br/>
time to complete yet, seems like a nice resource overall though. <br/>
Second - I live in MO where compulsory age is 7-16 - My ds is only 6 <br/>
so again this year I am lucky enough to not to HAVE to keep a log of <br/>
his &quot;hours, classes, courses, etc.&quot; not that any of those mean he <br/>
learned anything anyways! I am against compulsory schooling <br/>
altogether now that I  understand it more, or schooling in any <br/>
matter that forces the coersion of the child I am against!<br/>
Third - We refer to ourselves as &quot;homeschoolers&quot; because if I <br/>
say &quot;unschoolers&quot; people first ask if that is legal and then still <br/>
be totally confused about it. I dislike anything with the <br/>
word &quot;school&quot; in it because of what school represents to me. IF they <br/>
as for details I state we are Child-Led learners - which we are! <br/>
Luckily that term is a little more self explanatory. <br/>
Fourth - With it being &quot;back to school&quot; time I am frankly <br/>
overwhelmed with the amount of people, even people who claim to <br/>
be &quot;unschoolers&quot; talking about their lessons, textbooks and <br/>
assignments. In my opinion if you give your child an assignment in <br/>
the morning then they&#39;re NOT unschooling! SO far I think this is the <br/>
ONLY list I belong to that this is not a problem. If your child HAS <br/>
to do their math and reading before they can go to the park then <br/>
they&#39;re NOT unschooling! So mabye I don&#39;t know what unschooling is <br/>
as much as what it is NOT. As you can tell I am feeling overwhelmed <br/>
by this, I was just feeling a little more comfortable in my beliefs <br/>
when all of these people who claimed to be unschooling apparently <br/>
are clueless to what that really is - in my opinion. <br/>
Fifth - Also having a BIG problem with people who push thier child <br/>
into &quot;school&quot; early. Like I stated in my state compulsory age isn&#39;t <br/>
until 7, so why are people starting their &quot;Lessons&quot; at 4 or earlier -<br/>
 I talked to another mom who has a daughter my son&#39;s age last week, <br/>
she said she kept logs last year and this year so she could <br/>
get &quot;used&quot; to doing them, but then she went off into the curriculum <br/>
choices that they gave her as well! Urgh - having a choice also <br/>
means you can choose NOT to use any curriculum! I am NOT looking <br/>
forward to having to prepare a log of my sons &quot;hours&quot; because I feel <br/>
it is an invasion of our privacy, to have these just in case - to <br/>
have them to &quot;prove&quot; that my son is learning - Urgh why don&#39;t you <br/>
sit down and have a conversation with him!!! Another homeschooler <br/>
nearby has a child one year younger than ours - they are obsessed <br/>
with &quot;lessons&quot;, that their child can do all these thing that are <br/>
high for her age, that if she ever were to have to be &quot;placed&quot; in <br/>
school that she would certainly enter at a grade or two ahead of the <br/>
others her age. It is so sad that things are corrupted so much! <br/>
Anyhow as I stated we call what we do &quot;child-led learning&quot; because <br/>
if my child doesn&#39;t want it then we don&#39;t do it. I am trying to <br/>
start a small support network of likeminded people but it is really <br/>
hard to find people who &quot;get it&quot; about their children (Get it in the <br/>
meaning of Jan Hunt - that they believe that what a child thinks is <br/>
important). I wish I would have known about AP when my child was <br/>
young, as it was I held him almost constantly and was often told <br/>
to &quot;put him down before you spoil him&quot; and if I fell asleep nursing <br/>
then I would wake in a scare &quot;I could have killed my child by <br/>
nursing him in bed with me!&quot; and unfortuantely I suffured from PPP <br/>
and it took me awhile to stand up to most of the family that I <br/>
wanted to not work and stay at home with my child and we could make <br/>
our &quot;payments&quot; still fine - And have proved as much time after time <br/>
over the last 6 years! Unfortunately I didn&#39;t stop working until my <br/>
milk had started to dry from the 8 hours away from my baby, and <br/>
being I was a poor milker without any support (another story - <br/>
urgh)  I wish I had another chance to nurse but that is another <br/>
story as well. If it were not for the internet then I wouldn&#39;t know <br/>
what AP is - They should start a media campain or something - <br/>
perhaps if parents started out with their children close then they <br/>
would have a harder time sending them to the hands of strangers in <br/>
daycare and schools. <br/>
Sorry that I am rambling so much - apparently I just had a lot of <br/>
get out - I feel better now. So to recap I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s <br/>
what we call ourselves that is as important as how we treat our <br/>
children. Moza</div>

Yes, it gave me a chill just reading it.<br/>
The Barq&#39;s ice cream float pop thing probably helped.<br/>
<br/>
But honestly, I shuddered.  Poor kids.  Poor kids.<br/>
<br/>
And poor overall reputation of unschooling.    <br/>
<br/>
-=- If it were not for the internet then I wouldn&#39;t know <br/>
<br/>
what AP is - They should start a media campain or something - -=-<br/>
<br/>
Who would pay for it?  There&#39;s no money to be made, no products to sell them, <br/>
when you&#39;re telling people  &quot;just hold them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In fact, the stronger such things get, the more the OTHERS advertise.  <br/>
Formula, bottle, crib manufacturors don&#39;t want parent discouraging each other from <br/>
NEEDING that stuff.<br/>
<br/>
We were supposed to babysit today for the little girl we kept last Spring a <br/>
lot.  She&#39;s nearly 13 months old now.   8:10 a.m. I got a call saying she <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be here.  Bummer.    It was going to be out last time for a long time or <br/>
forever, and I wanted to take a photo of her and Holly for Holly to keep.    <br/>
But her parents bring her with toys we don&#39;t use, a pacifier we don&#39;t use, and <br/>
teething tablets we don&#39;t use.   At home, apparently, they consider all these <br/>
things necessary.     Holly has asked me WHY they use them or think we need <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
But...<br/>
It is very labor-intensive to do things our way here, which is to hold her, <br/>
play with her on the floor, take her wherever we&#39;re going so she can see, let <br/>
her touch things.  It&#39;s tiring.  But she doesn&#39;t need a pacifier.   <br/>
<br/>
Oh well.<br/>
We can&#39;t change the whole world at once. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
I agree.  One thing I know I did do, a year or so ago maybe, was to decline <br/>
to agree that anyone who is registered with any public school program is no <br/>
longer homeschooling.  I think if kids are home and not having to do lessons and <br/>
are with their moms, it doesn&#39;t bother me if they&#39;re signed up with an <br/>
umbrella school, or a school program in California or British Columbia (wasn&#39;t that <br/>
where it was?) so they can get funding for big stuff like lessons and pianos.   <br/>
I only care about their freedom and how the learning takes place.<br/>
<br/>
Those programs are very rare anyway.  But for where my interest and passion <br/>
lie, I would be more supportive of a natural-learning situation with state <br/>
funding than of a family who is NOT at all enrolled in a state program but they <br/>
might a well be because the kids are forced to &quot;do school,&quot; often WORSE than <br/>
school would have done.   I regret it when I think that anything I have ever done <br/>
made it easier for a family to command a child to STAY at that table and read <br/>
this revisionist history or that &quot;creationist science.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I care about how children learn, not about what their relationship to the <br/>
state is.<br/>
<br/>
And for making a statement like that last one, I probably lost value in some <br/>
quarters.  That&#39;s okay.  I went to school.  I know exactly how to do what the <br/>
teacher (supervisor, editor) wants.  I know how to compromise myself to get an <br/>
A.   Integrity is more important to me, though.  Through the years when <br/>
people have asked me to do this, or that, organization, board, politics, I&#39;ve <br/>
always said &quot;I only care about unschooling.&quot;    And it&#39;s still true.<br/>
