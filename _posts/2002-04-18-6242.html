&lt;&lt; There is an email from Cottonwood Farm in my inbox waiting to be <br/>
 opened.  How does this virus work?<br/>

The badrans is actually a worm attached to an e-mail. It will copy itself <br/>
into several files of your computer eventually, but it&#39;s main purpose is to <br/>
dump a backdoor Trojan virus somewhere.<br/>
These shouldn&#39;t damage your computer at all....they do however, make you <br/>
susceptible to a hacker. The Trojan makes it possible for unauthorized people <br/>
to access information in your computer. If you have financial stuff in there <br/>
or something I guess you should worry.<br/>
I have about five files infected with this right now and can&#39;t get them <br/>
cleaned up. It isn&#39;t multiplying and it isn&#39;t hurting anything, but I have to <br/>
take it in to get them off.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Have you been to the virus sites?  I&#39;m pretty sure the bad trans is the one <br/>
I took off my daughter&#39;s computer using a program that I *think* I got at <br/>
Symantec.  Most of the sites have instructions and/or removal <br/>
programs.  But then maybe you&#39;ve already tried that.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Weeeelllll....I&#39;m in a catch 22. If I go to get it all cleaned off my <br/>
computer then I have no way to update the anti-virus protection because my CD <br/>
drive is broken. <br/>
I did print out instructions for the BadTrans, but the Backdoor Trojan <br/>
instructions were SO lengthy I just sighed and gave up.<br/>
I could clean it up but then what? <br/>
My Dad put this anti-virus protection on with his CD, so I don&#39;t actually <br/>
have the CD to run the liveupdates and all.<br/>
I have the &#39;02 version but can&#39;t load it because of the CD drive.  So I just <br/>
figured I&#39;d take it in and have them replace it and clean the viruses off at <br/>
the same time.<br/>
We can&#39;t replace the CD drive ourselves because good &#39;ol Compaq has the thing <br/>
riveted in!! I think they&#39;re proprietary?<br/>
Hey, it was a free computer...I wasn&#39;t about to say no, Compaq or not!!!<br/>
