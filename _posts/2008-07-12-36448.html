<div id="ygrps-yiv-1851007084">It&#39;s amazing how everything just always comes together exactly when it is<br/>
supposed to. I have been having some rough days. My youngest (4 1/2, almost<br/>
5) has become quite the &quot;dumper&quot; over the last couple weeks. She seems bored<br/>
and I am working on helping her, but for a couple months some neighborhood<br/>
kids were coming over everyday to play, but they haven&#39;t come in about 2<br/>
weeks now. It seems like I am just not enough and my oldest doesn&#39;t want to<br/>
play much with her either.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, right now we have puzzle peices from a huge US map scattered on the<br/>
floor, cotton balls, playing cards, flash cards, blankets, pillows, books<br/>
and toys. It&#39;s overwhelming and the last couple days I feel like I am being<br/>
&quot;walked all over&quot; because &quot;no one will help me pick it up&quot;. How martyr-y is<br/>
that?<br/>
<br/>
Well, thank you Rebecca for posting what I needed to post myself and for all<br/>
the replies as well.<br/>
