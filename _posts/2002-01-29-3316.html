several people in my family for whom Marijuana was or<br/>

their behavior as much as heroine addicts and<br/>
alcoholics I have known.  On the other hand,<br/>
television can be just as addictive and unhealthy to<br/>
certain personality types, so perhaps it is a good<br/>

between physical addiction and mental addiction.  Pot<br/>
and TV would fall under the mental addiction category<br/>
and are comparable.  Caffeine, on the other hand, is<br/>
physically addicting.  I think you are right about the<br/>
personality, in a way.  I know some adults, well into<br/>
their thirties, who are so addicted to video games<br/>
that they have a hard time keeping a job.  It is<br/>
completely mental and not at all the fault of the<br/>
video games, though, or caused by those games.  The<br/>
problem lies within the person, not the machine. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Were you saying TV is mentally addictive as a reason to limit it?<br/>
<br/>
It is not reasonable to assume children are not capable of dealing with something potentially addictive to their personalities.  This is especially true if they have to learn to deal with their personalities for the rest of their lives.  There are many workaholics that come by their habit genetically.  It still doesn&#39;t give them the right to destroy their families because they can&#39;t bring balance into their own lives.<br/>
<br/>
FYI, I removed TV restrictions from my kids less than a month ago.  My reasoning for restricting it in the first place was that I didn&#39;t think they *could* maintain a balanced life.  I have an obsessive/compulsive personality and work hard at balancing things for myself.  I just didn&#39;t give them the credit they deserve.  I imagine some people will feel that a balanced life is not something to strive for and that individuals should pursue their interests to whatever extent that involves.  I would disagree.  Too much of anything can cause problems.<br/>

about the person that they need to work on and<br/>
control, not caused by the tv.  If some one cannot<br/>
control the addiction for themselves, limiting their<br/>
contact with the item is really not going to help.<br/>

&gt;Kitrina<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All addiction has mental elements.  Some addictions<br/>
also have more strong physical elements.  All<br/>
addiction problems lie within the person and must be<br/>
addressed there in order for them to move past them<br/>
and heal.  In my experience, a drug or alcohol addict<br/>
who is medically &quot;cured&quot; of their addiction will not<br/>
be able to function in a healthy way mentally, and<br/>
will return to their addiction, or another like it, or<br/>
multiple unhealthy behaviors, without recognizing the<br/>
addictive mental behaviors and addressing the problem<br/>
within themselves.  Alcoholics like this are referred<br/>
to as &quot;Dry Drunks.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Every person has differing biochemistry, and I believe<br/>
that science has yet to discover the ways in which an<br/>
individual&#39;s chemistry is affected by different<br/>
chemicals or mental stimuli.  Be that as it may,<br/>
mental addiction (like Katrina&#39;s friends with the<br/>
video games) can be enough to ruin lives.  There are<br/>
also a lot of physical substances that are not BAD in<br/>
and of themselves, and can be used quite safely in<br/>
moderation by SOME people(ie: caffiene, alcohol,<br/>
adrenaline, sugar) but to others are highly and easily<br/>
addicting and detrimental to their health.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s possible that TV stimulates some chemical<br/>
reaction in the brains of those that are addicted to<br/>
is unhealthily, and that they should avoid it for<br/>
their mental AND physical health, the same way an<br/>
alcoholic avoids drink.  Maybe not, but who knows for<br/>
sure?  But you are right, it IS mental (like ALL other<br/>
addictions) and that part of it is obvious.  Some<br/>
people can handle goobs of it unaffectedly, and some<br/>
cannot.  But I do think each person should decide that<br/>
for themselves, and not a parent decide for a child. <br/>
Children have to be free to make their own mistakes<br/>
and learn things their own way, or they are not free<br/>
to live their own lives.<br/>
