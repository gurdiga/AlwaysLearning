<div id="ygrps-yiv-387081400">I&#39;ve had visiting kids since the tenth.  My nephews and nieces, a boy,<br/>
Hunter 16, girl, Mylisa 15, girl, Lillie and boy, Evan 12, and a girl,<br/>
Emily 11.  <br/>
So up went the tent, the pool, the trampoline and there seems to be<br/>
steady night and day activities. <br/>
One morning, and almost every day since, there were two extra kids here. <br/>
I&#39;d never seen either one of them before, but they were calling me Tia<br/>
like my nieces and nephews do, and they seemed to know where everything<br/>
was.  One was making a sandwich in my kitchen and when I said - do I know<br/>
you ?-  he just laughed and headed out the back door.  Who knows how many<br/>
people I&#39;m really feeding?<br/>
I was watching one unknown boy jump on the trampoline, he was beautiful,<br/>
maybe 15 and so happy.  As I was calculating whether  my homeowners<br/>
insurance would pay for his broken head he said &quot;watch this back flip...&quot;<br/>
 and to my horror I heard my own voice saying ok, as if that was just<br/>
fine.  ( and it was )<br/>
Those trampolines have warnings about severe head injury, spinal injury,<br/>
death, but no kid ever reads that.  Only the parents do and we should be<br/>
sensible like the kids and ignore it.  I can&#39;t say enough about<br/>
trampolines.  There should be one warning about peeing before you get on<br/>
though, never mind spinal injury.<br/>
<br/>
We planned a three day camping trip starting with an eight mile hike to<br/>
Trask lakes.  If any of you have been in this area the trail head starts<br/>
at the end of Rock Creek Lake.  It&#39;s a beautiful hike and the kids, even<br/>
the little ones were great.  At Trask lakes though, there was three feet<br/>
of drifted snow and no place to camp.  You just don&#39;t know how<br/>
disappointing that is after an eight mile hike, but we started down again<br/>
hoping to find a good campsite somewhere along the trail.  We ended up<br/>
coming home, and the older kids were in bed half the next day but the<br/>
little ones were out on the trampoline.  <br/>
Deer Lodge has an event called Territorial Days every year, a kind of<br/>
historical celebration with a parade and a muscle car show, street<br/>
vendors and a street dance.  They always hold the Prison Break Run, ( the<br/>
MT State prison is here ) and all the kids decided to enter the five K. <br/>
Everyone of them got a medal for their age group, first place or second<br/>
or third and I&#39;m so amazed at how easy such things are for kids, just one<br/>
more thing to do on a Saturday morning, and by the way, we have these<br/>
medals...<br/>
We went bowling.  No one bowls, but we still had fun.  We went four<br/>
wheeling, or &quot;quad running&quot; as my nephew says.  We went camping, for real<br/>
this time, at Kading campground, near the headwaters of The Little<br/>
Blackfoot river, where Lillie, the 12 year old perfected her fly fishing<br/>
skills and Emily learned how to tie wooly buggers.  Dylan and I hiked the<br/>
trail to Blackfoot meadows, five miles and a little steep in some places.<br/>
 He scampers across streams and up the rough places like a mountain goat.<br/>
 That was a six hour hike but there was hot food waiting for us and a<br/>
campfire and all those fun kids.  <br/>
Their parents arrived Thursday, and they&#39;ve all gone off to do different<br/>
things and my house is so quiet these last two days.  Cleaner, but quiet.<br/>
 Dylan slept twelve hours Thursday night, I think just trying to catch<br/>
up.  We&#39;ll have the older kids again tonight and tomorrow because my<br/>
husband&#39;s promised to take them out and let them drive his old truck. <br/>
This is a big deal, learning a shift and their destination is the<br/>
fireworks shop at Race Track where they sell the big, noisy, terrorist<br/>
type, explosives.     <br/>
Everyone leaves on the fifth, and I don&#39;t know what we&#39;ll do around here<br/>
without them.  Now I know why my homeschooling friend in Colorado has<br/>
seven children.  There&#39;s a strange, soothing madness about a house and<br/>
yard full of kids.  <br/>

<br/>
WOW!<br/>
Sounds better than ANY summer camp!<br/>
<br/>
And although it probably cost you a lot in groceries, fireworks and gasoline, <br/>
it sounds like you had a great time too.<br/>
<br/>
Your kids will probably just be exhausted for a week after the others leave!<br/>

LOL! Now we get a glimpse, maybe, of how our children feel when their house<br/>
is invaded by strange guest adults. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Do you think we can stick to the budget?<br/>
What budget?<br/>
The grocery budget we agreed on...<br/>
There was a budget??<br/>
I guess not. <br/>
 <br/>
It HAS been exhausting, but wildly fun and worth it, and we still have <br/>
4th of July festivities to look forward to.  <br/>

up the street and there are five of them.  I figured that mother had<br/>
someone else&#39;s kids and didn&#39;t even know some of hers were missing.  When<br/>
everything settles down I&#39;ll take her some fudge, because I&#39;ll bet she<br/>
could use it, and I won&#39;t say a word about the back flip, and I might<br/>
even be able to find my husbands missing shoes there.<br/>

  Now this sounds like your family had the time of your lives - that is what I like about unschooling - the freedom to live.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-801411045">Sharon, I posted about kid visitors.  That post was on Saturday, the<br/>
29th, I think. <br/>
My mail&#39;s ok, but someone on the MTunschoolers list is having trouble<br/>
with mail from all her yahoo lists.  A yahoo snafu maybe. <br/>
