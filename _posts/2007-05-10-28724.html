<div id="ygrps-yiv-1124489566">My wife and I are embarking on unschooling with dd who is 3.5 and ds who is 1.  We came upon unschooling through our efforts to become unconditional parents over the past 1.5 years and our unsatisfactory pre-school experience.<br/>
   <br/>
  Our current issue is with freedom of choice with respect to food.  DD eats very little and always wants treats (cookies, candy, etc.).  We always have healthy snacks available and we currently limit the amount of treats dd can have in a day.  This creates some conflict and frustration on all parties.<br/>
   <br/>
  It really feels like we are teaching her to have an unhealthy attitude toward food and that we are not respecting her enough.  On the other hand, it is our job to keep her healthy and get her proper nutrition.<br/>
   <br/>
  Is there any collective wisdom on the list about where to draw the line, or even if the line should be drawn?<br/>
   <br/>
  Thanks,<br/>
   <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s still about learning, but even more than other areas, there are  <br/>
also instincts that will kick in once the artificial framework is  <br/>
removed, and your child will learn to listen to her own body about  <br/>
what she needs instead of looking in a magazine article or asking you.<br/>
<br/>
Many parents report having learned to eat better themselves after  <br/>
seeing their children make choices.<br/>
<br/>
it will take a while to settle, and the more controls and shaming and  <br/>
labels there were before, the longer it might take.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1866415068">I  found this book, &quot;Preventing Childhood Eating Problems&quot; to be  <br/>
helpful and interesting. Very unschooly.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.overcomingovereating.com/childhood.html">http://www.overcomingovereating.com/childhood.html</a><br/>
<br/>
And I know there have been plenty of discussions about it on the  <br/>
yahoo group AlwaysUnschooled.<br/>
<br/>
My dd is 3.5 yo and we have no restrictions or rules about food. She  <br/>
has access to the pantry and we put things she likes on low shelves  <br/>
and leave a bowl of fruit and other easily eaten items out on the  <br/>
table or counters. She often helps herself to things in the fridge.  <br/>
Sometimes it seems like all she is eating for days on end is bologna,  <br/>
but then she will just naturally balance it out by eating fruit for  <br/>
days, then bread and tortillas, etc. It certainly doesnt look like &quot;3  <br/>
square&quot; meals a day, but over the week or longer, it would all  <br/>
average out.<br/>

I missed the original post, sorry.<br/>
Kids know how to eat. We only get messed up when we start putting <br/>
external rules to an internal process. Provide tons of options and go <br/>
from there. I&#39;ve recently begun trying to reverse decades of diet <br/>
mentality in myself and I notice that even though I&#39;ve tried not to do <br/>
that to my daughter, I&#39;ve already put rules to what, when, where, why, <br/>
etc she can and can&#39;t eat. I wish I hadn&#39;t done that. I&#39;m trying to <br/>
reverse that trend for her as well. If she chooses to eat ramen for <br/>
every meal for a week, who am I to say no. Today she chose a PB&J <br/>
instead w/ no prompting from me. Good for her. :) Good for me too. :)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I find it helpful to look at the various factors that make &quot;treats&quot; <br/>
attractive. Since portability, availability of small portions, and <br/>
attractive presentation are all things my dd finds appealing, I try <br/>
to add those elements to more nutritious foods, especially if she&#39;s <br/>
not eating a whole lot. One way I do that if Mo&#39;s really focussed on <br/>
a project and forgetting to eat, is to put together a mixed plate <br/>
with tiny portions of different foods - maybe just all on the plate, <br/>
maybe in little bowls or cups - and bringing it right to her so that <br/>
she doesn&#39;t have to stop what she&#39;s doing to eat. I include things <br/>
like cookies and chips in with other offerrings, and often she&#39;ll <br/>
eat some of everything, or ignore the &quot;treats&quot; altogether.<br/>
<br/>
Another method I use, if she&#39;s prefrerring to get her own food, is <br/>
to make individual servings of home-made or bulk foods in baggies or <br/>
wraps or bowls, and decant milk and juice into smaller containers <br/>
that are easier for her to pour. <br/>
<br/>
I find that sort of attention to detail helps Mo make decisions <br/>
about food based more on what her body needs. My stepson, too, for <br/>
that matter. He&#39;s perfectly happy to heat up nutritous leftovers <br/>
when he&#39;s up late at night, but doesn&#39;t have a lot of confidence <br/>
when it comes to cooking from scratch, so he prefers to make <br/>
convenience foods. Keeping the fridge stocked with foods that are <br/>
easy *and* nutritious lets him make a decision based on something <br/>
other than convenience.<br/>
<br/>
All that being said, sometimes someone in the family wants to eat a <br/>
lot of cookies, or boxed mac&#39;n&#39;cheese for a couple days, or <br/>
whatever. I really believe that bc we&#39;ve chosen not to create a <br/>
power struggle over those sorts of things its much easier for Mo and <br/>
Ray to experiment with that kind of eating, learn what they want to <br/>
learn from it, and move on. Its noticabley harder for me or my <br/>
partner to move on when its one of us who wants to eat cookies all <br/>
day (guilt guilt guilt guilt guilt). <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-47838142">I appreciate all the feedback.  One of our concerns is the terrible <br/>
behavior that would accompany any period of adjustment to complete <br/>
freedom.  This is not an unfounded or made up fear.<br/>
<br/>
When DD crashes after having alot of sugar, she gets very physically <br/>
aggressive with us and her little brother, she also gets very angry and <br/>
ends up screaming alot.  This makes it hard on the whole family.<br/>
<br/>
Is this just something we would have to get through?  Any ideas for <br/>
minimizing this negative period.<br/>
<br/>
This is one of our daily struggles; how do we give DD freedom when that <br/>
freedom encroaches on the well-being of DS or my wife?<br/>
<br/>
So while intellectually I have no problem with digesting that it will <br/>
all even out in time, emotionally I am worried about the impacts on the <br/>
family during the process.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ends up screaming alot.  This makes it hard on the whole family.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can only speak from my own experience.  Generally when one of my <br/>
children are very hungry, they will naturally go for easy sugars.  If <br/>
I don&#39;t attend to their hunger needs in advance, then cookies and the <br/>
like will get eaten.  If their blood sugar levels spike, then crash, <br/>
they feel cranky and irritable without realizing why.  <br/>
<br/>
If at that time, I offer up a plate of food with protein and other <br/>
stuff, they will gobble it down and feel better and be nicer.  It&#39;s <br/>
best though, to recognize when they are starting to get hungry, <br/>
before they load up on stuff that will make them crash.<br/>
<br/>
I am by no means telling my kids that they can&#39;t have those easy <br/>
sugars, I just try to give it to them with other food too, before <br/>
they get so hungry they want whats easiest, and what their bodies <br/>
know will give them that quick boost it needs.<br/>
<br/>
Some kids like sugar more than others.  I have one child that hardly <br/>
ever eats candy, but will eat chocolate or cookies or ice cream, and <br/>
another child that will most often eat candy over cookies or ice <br/>
cream, or sometimes they want it all, and sometimes none of it.  <br/>
<br/>
Once you get rid of the control, kids find balance for their own <br/>
particular bodies.</div>

have one child that would just fall asleep after crashing and wake up <br/>

usually eggs, nuts, cheese or yogurt.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-38139072">I&#39;m really busy this weekend and don&#39;t have time to research this,  <br/>
but there have been tests that showed it wasn&#39;t sugar that caused  <br/>
excitement in children, but the excitement of the party (birthday  <br/>
cake) or the privilege (having something that&#39;s usually denied) and  <br/>
not the sugar itself.<br/>
<br/>
In the tests (someone here will know where the reports are, I hope),  <br/>
parents reported themselves that their chidren were or weren&#39;t having  <br/>
&quot;a sugar high&quot; but some of those kids had had no sugar at all.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s another boogeyman parents use to control children and the fact  <br/>
that the parents believe there really is a boogeyman doesn&#39;t make it  <br/>
any more real.<br/>
<br/>
When I was little there were lies parents believed about coffee (will  <br/>
stunt your growth) and chocolate (will give you zits, will give you  <br/>
exzema) but it seems really they just didn&#39;t want to share expensive  <br/>
Valentines&#39; chocolates with little kids or share expensive (or the- <br/>

I had already written my other post about sugar as a boogeyman when I  <br/>
read this.<br/>
<br/>
If you feel that you&#39;re somehow keeping her healthy by controlling  <br/>
her diet for her, you will have a very difficult time not controlling  <br/>
other parts of her life.<br/>

If you saw some of the unschooled teens, how healthy they are and how  <br/>
UNlikely they are to be eating Twinkies, you would feel differently  <br/>
right then and there.<br/>

You&#39;ll be blaming her (or rather sugar) for not giving him more  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-735612328">Hi, John<br/>
<br/>
Just some &#39;random neural firings&#39; on this from my own experience that <br/>
may or may not be helpful. This goes right back to when my now grown <br/>
up never unschooled daughter was a baby and I first became a stay-at-<br/>
home dad, so it&#39;s not strictly &#39;unschooling&#39; - but, if I might be so <br/>
bold as to put it this way, it&#39;s my view that unschooling parents <br/>
have this right where conventional parents don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I read something in a self-help book about the time I became a parent <br/>
that stuck with me because it resonated with my parenting philosophy <br/>
of &quot;baby steps and continuous forward movement&quot;. Don&#39;t recall now who <br/>
to thank for putting that idea into words for me, but this is from a <br/>
guy called Ken Keyes Jr. and he called it something like &#39;Three Rules <br/>
for Happiness&#39;:<br/>
<br/>
1. Ask for what you want - but don&#39;t demand it.<br/>
<br/>
2. Accept whatever happens - for now.<br/>
<br/>
3. Turn up your love - even if you don&#39;t get what you want.<br/>
<br/>
How does this work for me in practice?<br/>
<br/>
Well, right now, my 11 year old son Pat won&#39;t eat fruit. In fact, <br/>
that&#39;s been the case for most of his childhood. I want him to eat <br/>
fruit. That&#39;s for my benefit - then I&#39;m a &#39;good&#39; parent, right? What <br/>
a relief. Who wants to be thought of as a &#39;bad&#39; parent?<br/>
<br/>
So, one day Pat&#39;s a bit peckish, and I ask him, &quot;Would you like <br/>
a banana?&quot; (He did eat bananas when he was a toddler)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No thanks.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Okay. What would you like?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Would you cook me some rice?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Sure.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And so we get on with our lives.<br/>
<br/>
I still want Pat to eat fruit. Maybe a couple of days later, Pat&#39;s in <br/>
the pantry looking for something to snack on.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;There are some bananas here if you want one.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No thanks.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
End of conversation. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe a couple of days later I&#39;m eating a banana myself and I say to <br/>
Pat, &quot;Mmmm ... I love bananas. Did you know bananas are one of the <br/>
most nutritional foods you can eat?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Pat says, &quot;Bob, I know you&#39;re trying to trick me into eating a banana <br/>
and it won&#39;t work.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And we both burst out laughing.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe Pat will eat bananas one day, maybe he won&#39;t. I want him to. <br/>
I&#39;m also okay with his decision either way.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, I&#39;ve made some major changes to my own diet as a <br/>
result of wondering about what my son eats, while learning not to be <br/>
too concerned about that. That&#39;s made me a more useful model. My son <br/>
won&#39;t eat vegetables either. But it&#39;s worth noting that he does drink <br/>
mostly water, sometimes milk, and won&#39;t touch fizzy drinks (soda); he <br/>
rarely eats candy (&#39;lollies&#39; here in Australia) and the only &#39;junk <br/>
food&#39; he likes is potato chips and mcnuggets. So it&#39;s not all bad. :)<br/>
<br/>
That reminds me of something from my daughter&#39;s early childhood in <br/>
rural England. Sometimes when she and I were in the village shop, <br/>
she&#39;d ask for some candy (&#39;sweets&#39; in England) and, me being me, I&#39;d <br/>
say, &quot;What would you like?&quot; So we would get home with a big bag of <br/>
sweets and Bronnie would eat one or a few and decide to save the rest <br/>
for later. Usually, she&#39;d end up sharing them with her playmates, <br/>
and, if that didn&#39;t happen, the bag of sweets would be in her room <br/>
completely untouched, sometimes for weeks.<br/>
<br/>
One day when she was about six or seven, my daughter had a box of <br/>
Smarties (do you have those in America? They&#39;re like M&Ms). It had <br/>
been inside an Easter egg she&#39;d previously eaten and she&#39;d had this <br/>
box of Smarties for days without opening it. Some of her friends came <br/>
to play after school - four other girls - and Bronnie opened the box <br/>
of Smarties and laid them all out in rows on the table according to <br/>
their colour, as you do, maybe sixty or seventy Smarties all <br/>
together, and she invited her friends to help themselves if they <br/>
wanted some. It was like a feeding frenzy at the zoo. I&#39;m standing <br/>
there watching this with my eyes popping out of my head, thinking <br/>
maybe that wasn&#39;t such a good idea if the other girls were going home <br/>
to have their tea, but too late, so I suggested to Bronnie she might <br/>
like to grab a few Smarties herself before they all go. I could see <br/>
from the look on her face that she was thinking something <br/>
like, &quot;Hmmm ... that was unexpected.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well, when I was a boy, my parents were poor (my wife and I aren&#39;t) <br/>
and sweets were a luxury. It&#39;s more difficult for some parents than <br/>
it is for others to be supportive of what their children want. If <br/>
they choose to be. That wasn&#39;t the case with my parents. I got a <br/>
small bag of sweets once a week, on a Saturday, that was supposed to <br/>
last me until the next Saturday - but it *was* contingent upon <br/>
me &#39;being good&#39;. That&#39;s a different consideration.<br/>
<br/>
All I know is that I hardly ever eat candy myself these days, but, <br/>
only last week, I bought a big bag of marshmallows and ate every one <br/>
of them myself in about ten minutes. And felt sick afterwards. That <br/>
was totally triggered by childhood memories and nothing to do with <br/>
food. I wasn&#39;t even hungry, never mind hungry for candy.<br/>
<br/>
Food as a substitute for other things - a deep and complex subject. <br/>
Every body is different. And we really don&#39;t know what&#39;s for our <br/>
children&#39;s good. All the more reason for us to trust our children to <br/>
trust what their own bodies tell them so that food is all about what <br/>
our body actually needs and not what our mind thinks it needs.<br/>

If at  that time, I offer up a plate of food with protein and other <br/>

I noticed mine have been coming downstairs in the morning and heading  <br/>

just figured that as kids, they needed more *quick* energy than I do  <br/>
(especially after 10 hours of fasting while they sleep!), and just didn&#39;t have  time <br/>
to wait for me to make something. Does anyone have suggestions on what  I could <br/>
assemble the night before and have on their table (which they go by to  get <br/>
to the sweet stuff) that 1. won&#39;t spoil while we&#39;re sleeping (neither of  them <br/>

The situation is characterized as either she gets free access to  <br/>

she&#39;s in a mood to hit, she shouldn&#39;t be left alone with him. She  <br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; These things do not help if she has unfettered access to sugary foods.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you feel it&#39;s the sugar and you don&#39;t have older kids, why are  <br/>
there sugary foods in your house? It&#39;s cruel to bring it in and then  <br/>
say &quot;No, you can&#39;t have it,&quot; or &quot;You can have it only when I say it&#39;s  <br/>
okay.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;s reaching for sugar a lot, it could be she&#39;s gearing up for a  <br/>
growth spurt and it&#39;s her body&#39;s way of packing in the calories it  <br/>
needs. If sugar is combined with whole grains and fat it&#39;s going to  <br/>
slow how quickly it&#39;s absorbed and how quickly the blood sugar goes  <br/>
up. Rather than restricting her, think in terms of expanding her diet  <br/>
to *help* her: whole grain muffins, peanut butter and oatmeal cookies  <br/>
made with whole grain flour and so on.<br/>
<br/>
Is it plausible that a 3.5 yo body wouldn&#39;t yet be able to  <br/>
emotionally handle the rapid body chemistry changes that come from  <br/>
foods that are converted so quickly by the body? It&#39;s plausible,  <br/>
certainly. I&#39;m skeptical but you&#39;re convinced. The problem, as far as  <br/>
the conversation goes, is that from your point of absolute certainty  <br/>
that sugar is the cause you&#39;re asking people who aren&#39;t certain for  <br/>
permission to restrict your daughter&#39;s diet. (Which is why you&#39;re  <br/>
getting debate on whether sugar is really a problem or not.)<br/>
<br/>
To get useful answers you can either<br/>
<br/>
1) convince people here that sugar really is a problem -- though I  <br/>
would advise against that since it could get messy (and boring for  <br/>
people who just want unschooling discussion), but you could look in  <br/>
the archives for information on how unschoolers help children with  <br/>
food allergies like peanuts and wheat gluten, or<br/>
<br/>
2) ask for advice about how to help her with emotions that change  <br/>
rapidly (people have dealt with kids whose emotions run high so  <br/>
there&#39;s lots of wisdom along those lines.)<br/>

etc.).  We always have healthy snacks available and we currently limit <br/>
the amount of treats dd can have in a day.  This creates some conflict <br/>
and frustration on all parties.<br/>
<br/>
I have nine children and unlike lots of folks did not start out with a <br/>
clear parenting philosophy or plan. What I have discovered is <br/>
modelling is our best way to share with our kids. <br/>
<br/>
I currently have seven kids at home. Somedays they eat more processed <br/>
foods and some days those foods dry out on the counter and they are <br/>
eating salads and fruit. Overall the bigger issue it is for you the <br/>
more you are creating the thing you want to avoid. <br/>
<br/>
I am a fairly healthy eater. I vocalize why I eat what I do , when the <br/>
kids ask. I personally try to avoid  processed foods because they make <br/>
me feel bad. The kids all know and respect my choices. <br/>
<br/>
When I go to the store I always ask what they would like to add to the <br/>
list. It can be fruit snacks, or grapefruit or whatever they are <br/>
craving or wanting. I try to honor what they are wanting at the time. <br/>
The less I differenciate on what they are choosing&lt; GOOD FOOD BAD <br/>
FOOD&gt; and just eat the food that I like the more my kids eat great <br/>
food. Not always ds just ate a box of oreos while reading Legend of <br/>
Zelda stories on the internet. Tomorrow he may eat salad  covered in <br/>
homemade ranch all day. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-459496434">I must not be communicating very well, because I thought I made it<br/>
clear that I thought the restriction was probably bad (and I am<br/>
convinced of that), but that there were consequences I was trying to<br/>
minimize if the restrictions were lifted.<br/>
<br/>
We are doing just about everything recommended as far as expanding<br/>
opportunities to nutrition and also are actively teaching her to deal<br/>
with her emotions.  I appreciate that people start there, because I<br/>
can see where all these things need to be done and that some parents<br/>
may not be aware.  It also might be relevant to note that she is in OT<br/>
for sensory integration issues.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of points though.  Nobody knows my family, but lets assume we<br/>
are on our way to giving as much freedom as possible and this is one<br/>
of our last stumbling blocks.  Also, lets assume we know our children<br/>
and we know what makes behavior we are actively addressing worse.  I<br/>
can assure you I am not looking for a boogeyman to control my kids,<br/>
just the opposite, I was seeking wisdom on how to let go of control<br/>
while reducing negative consequences to the rest of the family.<br/>
<br/>
So here is a more on topic unschooling question, how do people handle<br/>
conflicts when DD and DS want completely different things and both<br/>
cannot be given their freedom to choose at the same time?  For<br/>
example, we are at the park and DD wants to go across the park to the<br/>
trees, but DS wants to stay at the slide.  Taking either side causes a<br/>
problem, so how does one decide who gets their way.<br/>

&gt; &gt; However, how many hits, pushes, scratches, screams must<br/>
&gt; &gt; everyone else endure during the regulation process?  Is it even fair<br/>
&gt; &gt; to make the decision for DS to subject him to this for the good of DD?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He shouldn&#39;t be hit at all. He should feel safe in his own home.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The situation is characterized as either she gets free access to  <br/>
&gt; sugar and hits her brother or her sugar is restricted and he doesn&#39;t  <br/>
&gt; get hit. Those aren&#39;t the only two options. *Whatever the cause*, if  <br/>
&gt; she&#39;s in a mood to hit, she shouldn&#39;t be left alone with him. She  <br/>
&gt; should be off doing something more interesting.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; These things do not help if she has unfettered access to sugary foods.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you feel it&#39;s the sugar and you don&#39;t have older kids, why are  <br/>
&gt; there sugary foods in your house? It&#39;s cruel to bring it in and then  <br/>
&gt; say &quot;No, you can&#39;t have it,&quot; or &quot;You can have it only when I say it&#39;s  <br/>
&gt; okay.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If she&#39;s reaching for sugar a lot, it could be she&#39;s gearing up for a  <br/>
&gt; growth spurt and it&#39;s her body&#39;s way of packing in the calories it  <br/>
&gt; needs. If sugar is combined with whole grains and fat it&#39;s going to  <br/>
&gt; slow how quickly it&#39;s absorbed and how quickly the blood sugar goes  <br/>
&gt; up. Rather than restricting her, think in terms of expanding her diet  <br/>
&gt; to *help* her: whole grain muffins, peanut butter and oatmeal cookies  <br/>
&gt; made with whole grain flour and so on.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is it plausible that a 3.5 yo body wouldn&#39;t yet be able to  <br/>
&gt; emotionally handle the rapid body chemistry changes that come from  <br/>
&gt; foods that are converted so quickly by the body? It&#39;s plausible,  <br/>
&gt; certainly. I&#39;m skeptical but you&#39;re convinced. The problem, as far as  <br/>
&gt; the conversation goes, is that from your point of absolute certainty  <br/>
&gt; that sugar is the cause you&#39;re asking people who aren&#39;t certain for  <br/>
&gt; permission to restrict your daughter&#39;s diet. (Which is why you&#39;re  <br/>
&gt; getting debate on whether sugar is really a problem or not.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To get useful answers you can either<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1) convince people here that sugar really is a problem -- though I  <br/>
&gt; would advise against that since it could get messy (and boring for  <br/>
&gt; people who just want unschooling discussion), but you could look in  <br/>
&gt; the archives for information on how unschoolers help children with  <br/>
&gt; food allergies like peanuts and wheat gluten, or<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2) ask for advice about how to help her with emotions that change  <br/>
&gt; rapidly (people have dealt with kids whose emotions run high so  <br/>
&gt; there&#39;s lots of wisdom along those lines.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi, John<br/>
<br/>
How I do it is to look for what I call the &#39;Third Way&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
One person wants to go one way, the other person wants to go a <br/>
different way at the same time. So I make an assumption that there&#39;s <br/>
a way they both want to go that nobody&#39;s thought of yet. <br/>
<br/>
How I find the &#39;Third Way&#39;. Stephen Covey, in The 7 Habits of <br/>
Effective People, calls it starting with the end in mind. What do you <br/>
really want? I&#39;m assuming what you really want is for both of your <br/>
children to be happy and satisfied in a certain set of circumstances. <br/>
You don&#39;t know *how* to get what you want. But you know what it is <br/>
for your children to be happy and satisfied and you know what the <br/>
specific circumstances are. So start with the &#39;what&#39; and backtrack to <br/>
the &#39;how&#39;. <br/>
<br/>
This is a form of lateral thinking (as in Edward de Bono). Some <br/>
people call it creative visualization or just visualization.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s actually a natural process, but its real power is in using it <br/>
deliberately in a self-disciplined way to produce specific positive <br/>
outcomes.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to know more, please email me off list, because it&#39;s not <br/>
an unschooling topic. :)<br/>

their way so the other doesn&#39;t. But, instead, try to find ways that  <br/>
both can be relatively happy. Maybe DD will be willing to stay at the  <br/>
slide for 10 more minutes if daddy offers to push her on the swings.  <br/>
Maybe ds will be willing to go across the park if daddy pulls out  <br/>
some bread to feed the ducks.<br/>
<br/>
What you might want to consider is modeling a different approach - be  <br/>
&quot;solution-oriented&quot; rather than seeing conflicts as having to choose  <br/>
who gets their way.<br/>

<br/>

The list is about ideas, not about people.<br/>
Think of ideas like balls and the list like a ball court. If someone  <br/>
tosses an idea worth discussing into the court it&#39;s going to get  <br/>
batted about. At that point what&#39;s going on is no longer about the  <br/>
person who tossed the idea in. It&#39;s about the idea and how well and  <br/>
cleanly it&#39;s being tossed about. (Unless the tosser keeps jumping in  <br/>
and grabbing the idea ball saying &quot;Mine!&quot;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1633898084">I apologize for being defensive.  Thanks for an interesting discussion<br/>
everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Just FYI, OT is occupational therapy.  It is pretty common to help<br/>
children with sensory issues regulate their input and control their<br/>
emotions.  It is not a matter of label and control, merely another way<br/>
to help her learn how to manage her senses and emotions.  She chooses<br/>
to go or not (with no coercion), and it is only play therapy.<br/>
<br/>
For whatever reason DD has problems with impulse control that we are<br/>
all working on.  Finding alternative solutions to disputes between her<br/>
and DS are often hard to find.  We always try to find a solution that<br/>
works for everyone; this is much easier on weekends and when I am home<br/>
from work.<br/>
<br/>
We are a family that practices respect for everyone in the family and<br/>
 gives as much freedom as possible.  The food issue and balancing<br/>
freedoms between two children seem to be our biggest issues to still<br/>
resolve.<br/>
