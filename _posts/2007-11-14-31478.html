<div id="ygrps-yiv-772884034">I have been searching for a couple days and just not finding what I want,  so <br/>
I thought I&#39;d ask here and see if anyone has any ideas.<br/>
 <br/>
A friend sent me a link to her blog on wordpress that has pages you can use  <br/>
with your blog. She&#39;s got it set up as a &quot;wish list&quot; for her son (for  <br/>
holiday/birthday gift ideas) and I think its really a neat idea that friends and  <br/>
family can go to without having to have a specific program for viewing or  <br/>
printing. I don&#39;t like the format because the print is too large and the spacing  is <br/>
too much and it can&#39;t be altered, so I was looking around for another, free  <br/>
service that was either more my style or something that can be altered. I&#39;ve  <br/>
been looking in &quot;blogs&quot; and trying to find one with pages, but I&#39;m not having  <br/>
any luck. Any *alternate* ideas would work, too, because I don&#39;t really need <br/>
the  &quot;blog&quot; part of it, just a place to write out our lists and share it with <br/>
folks.  I definitely don&#39;t want something that is just a link-type list, <br/>
though I could  deal with that as an added feature. I really want something that I <br/>
can write out  and describe, if necessary. Am I too picky? Does anyone have <br/>
any ideas?  Thanks!<br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-380435617">I think you&#39;re talking about the free version of wordpress,<br/>
www.wordpress.com .. you can&#39;t alter the themes without paying<br/>
something. You can choose from a lot of themes though and not all of<br/>
them will have the big type. You can make pages and title them as you<br/>
want. Wishlist, Books, Recipes etc ..<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also  www.tumblr.com. You are given the option of posting text<br/>
(which could be your lists), video, chats, pictures, links (or this<br/>
could your lists), audio and quotes. I am not sure if you can have<br/>
individual pages but it&#39;s more scaled down version of a regular blog.<br/>
<br/>
They are both free.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I could write a blog post with Hayden&#39;s wish list, with descriptions and<br/>
links (which I gotta do, thanks for the reminder!). Each entry has it&#39;s own<br/>
address, so it&#39;d be easy to give the &quot;hannahbearski.blogspot.com/wishlist&quot;<br/>
address to folks to need to know. I can also put a picture/paragraph on my<br/>
sidebar with a link to the individual post. Does that make sense?<br/>
When I get ours done, you can take a peek :)<br/>
