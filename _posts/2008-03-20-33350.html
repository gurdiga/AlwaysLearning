<div id="ygrps-yiv-639068110">From a MySpace bulletin, my wise daughter, Holly (16):<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
26. What do you know about the future ?<br/>
<br/>
Things are going to get better before they get worse, unless they get  <br/>
worse and then get better, but things are going to be better and then  <br/>
worse and then good and then bad, because that&#39;s the way it always  <br/>
happens. That&#39;s the way it&#39;s going to be. <br/>
