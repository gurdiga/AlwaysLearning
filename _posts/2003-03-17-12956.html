<div id="ygrps-yiv-158685641">Because of a couple of recent rough spots, I want to offer the group&#39;s <br/>
description (from the yahoo homepage for this group) to remind people to <br/>
focus on how unschooling works.    Thanks.<br/>
-------------------------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Discussion for homeschooling fans of John Holt, whose books Learning All the <br/>
Time, Never Too Late, and Teach your Own have made unschooling a sweet and <br/>
viable option for thousands of families.   <br/>
<br/>
This is a moderated group, with trapdoors for the uncooperative. (Not <br/>
moderated in the advance-approval way, but in the be-nice-to-play way.)   <br/>
It&#39;s an idea group and is intended to lean more toward pure unschooling than <br/>
neutral, general homeschooling discussion--there are hundreds of general <br/>
homeschooling discussions for newcomers.   It&#39;s to focus more toward how <br/>
people learn no matter where in the world they are, rather than on what&#39;s <br/>
legal in any particular country or jurisdiction.   <br/>
<br/>
