Subject: confused about unschooling<br/>
<br/>
I have asked for help before, and here I am again. I don&#39;t post much <br/>
at all, but I am starting to feel like I just don&#39;t get unschooling. <br/>
In theory, yes it makes total sense to me. And, the thought of <br/>
sending my kids to school just doesn&#39;t make sense to me. (And the <br/>
fact that they don&#39;t want to). My problem is that I read about all <br/>
of these cool, fun things that other people do, and I just don&#39;t see <br/>
that happening for us. I have all of these ideas in my head, but <br/>
seem to have a hard time bringing them to fruition. I feel like a <br/>
deadbeat. I am not writing this to get sympathy, I know that is not <br/>
what this list is all about.  I am getting some help for anxiety, so <br/>
that is part of my problem. I am overwelmed with &quot;should be&#39;s&quot;, <br/>
which leads to anxiety,which leads to me doing nothing. Maybe I need <br/>
to be de-schooled more?! I think if someone told me what to do with <br/>
the kids each day, I could do it. I know unschooling isn&#39;t like this <br/>
though. <br/>
<br/>
My kids are watching too much tv right now because they are bored. I <br/>
have read so many books and articles and it all makes complete <br/>
sense. It is putting these things into real life that I don&#39;t get. <br/>
My kids don&#39;t have these cool projects going on. They do play <br/>
outside alot, and with some neighbor kids, and they are each taking <br/>
a class (gymnastics and trampoline). It just doesn&#39;t feel &quot;right&quot; to <br/>
me. I am trying to be more present, which is a big problem for me. I <br/>
tend to escape in reading, I am working on this. <br/>
<br/>
What do you read?  Could you read outloud to your kids, even small sections<br/>
or a few paragraphs from what your reading and then discuss it a little...I<br/>
used to think I had to read the whole thing, cover to cover, to my kids, but<br/>
have since seen that I can read them pieces of things and have great<br/>
conversations, whatever I am reading....also, we discovered we love to<br/>
listen to certain books on tape together...we get them mostly at the<br/>
Libray...I have boys, age 11 and 15...they loved Eragon (written by a<br/>
homeschoolers)..on tape available at Target, and we&#39;ve loved the Artemis<br/>
Fowl series, all on tape and available at the public library.  It worked<br/>
because it combined my passion for reading with their interests.  (I love to<br/>
read and &quot;escape&quot; into reading lots too...what&#39;s wrong with that...should be<br/>
sure and put your book down when it doesn&#39;t feel right and find something to<br/>
do with the kids)<br/>
<br/>
Another problem is <br/>
that I don&#39;t feel like I have interesting things going on in my <br/>
life. The worst part is that I can&#39;t really think of anything that <br/>
sounds interesting to me. <br/>
<br/>
Is this all the time or is it just when you are feeling down...it could be<br/>
that you are in a dark time in your life...which is part of life and<br/>
possibly part of unschooling...(I went through a dark night of the<br/>
soul...read the book  &quot;Dark Nights of the Soul&quot; by Thomas Moore.  Really<br/>
helped me be O.K. with it.  Making yourself wrong for the way your life is<br/>
will only get you further into the muck.  On the other hand, you do need to<br/>
listen to that still, quiet voice, and take what steps you need to find your<br/>
way back home.  I did some work with an organization called the Landmark<br/>
Education Corporation and the Landmark Forum...they have a website, if<br/>
you&#39;re interested.  That helped, too.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what I am asking for. Maybe others that have been in <br/>
this place? I don&#39;t know. <br/>
<br/>
Just to let you know...yes, others have been in this place...namely me.<br/>
That would make two of us.  &quot;I&#39;m nobody, who are you.  Are you nobody two?<br/>
There&#39;s the two of us.&quot;  Emily Dickinson&#39;s beautiful poem...poetry is good<br/>
stuff to read and talk about with your kids.  Also, works to talk to them<br/>
about your confusion. Kids are great listeners.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
Amie<br/>

Every day, do two things from one of these lists or descriptions:<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t reproduce anyone&#39;s whole day, but you can do ONE of the  <br/>
things they did.<br/>
<br/>

me.-=-<br/>
<br/>
You should be watching with them.<br/>
You should have cool projects going on.<br/>
You should play outside with them.<br/>
<br/>
It seems they&#39;re doing some things and you&#39;re doing some other things.<br/>
Find things to do together, and if you can&#39;t lure them to your  <br/>
things, go to theirs.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have computer games or video games?  If you&#39;re at all musical,  <br/>
consider getting one of the music games like Donkey Konga, Karaoke  <br/>
Revolution or Guitar Hero, but only if YOU will play with them.   If  <br/>
you can afford to do one of those, get two sets of drums, two  <br/>
headsets or two guitars (especially important in the drums area).<br/>
<br/>
You talked about TV, but didn&#39;t talk about DVDs, movies...<br/>
<br/>
-=-I  tend to escape in reading, I am working on this. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you need to escape out away from the house, with the kids.<br/>
<br/>
-=-The worst part is that I can&#39;t really think of anything that  <br/>
sounds interesting to me. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Does sending your kids to school sound interesting to you?<br/>
You need to make what you&#39;re doing BETTER than school, better in ways  <br/>
that any social worker or relative or neighbor can easily see.<br/>
<br/>
It won&#39;t happen overnight, but it will NEVER happen if you escape in  <br/>
books while they watch TV and play outside.<br/>

&gt; TV is right up there with politics and religion.  I<br/>
&gt; mean this topic elicits more questions than &quot;What<br/>
&gt; about church?&quot; in the unschooling community.  I think<br/>
&gt; even sugar is less of a hot topic than TV.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And it really cracks me up.  Because TV is like a<br/>
&gt; godsend around here.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My girls really like to wake up slowly watching TV.<br/>
&gt; This is great for me because it gives me a chance to<br/>
&gt; drink my espresso, read the paper (still looking for a<br/>
&gt; dog), switch the laundry, maybe do a little pilates,<br/>
&gt; and generally prepare for the day.  A moment to clean<br/>
&gt; in the morning is great for me.  I feel ready to say<br/>
&gt; lots of yeses when I&#39;m not saying, &quot;Let me just slick<br/>
&gt; this up first.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; TV often offers us a moment to reconnect.  I can sit<br/>
&gt; down with the girls and laugh out loud or ask what<br/>
&gt; shows they like and why.  Many, many great<br/>
&gt; conversations have happened because of this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We have the sit and spin and a mini tramp and puzzles<br/>
&gt; and games and art projects and a computer and Lego&#39;s<br/>
&gt; and baby dolls and magazines and books in the same<br/>
&gt; room as one of our TVs...people rarely just sit<br/>
&gt; passively and watch TV.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It offers siblings a chance to do something together.<br/>
&gt; Or, it can get them apart!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Lots of imaginative games and pretend play have ensued<br/>
&gt; due to an idea gleaned from a television program.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We&#39;ve discovered new crafts, new recipes, art<br/>
&gt; activities and science projects...all from TV.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Many new concepts have come to us via TV:  from<br/>
&gt; beginning reading for my almost three year old to the<br/>
&gt; study of physics and &quot;The Elegant Universe&quot; for<br/>
&gt; myself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Half the music I like I found from watching TV and<br/>
&gt; movies...either from soundtracks or music videos or<br/>
&gt; musical guests or TV concerts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My husband turns it on at bedtime for white noise.  He<br/>
&gt; has to wake up earlier than us and this drowns out our<br/>
&gt; sometimes loud sounds late at night.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; TV (I&#39;m thinking parody here) has given us many ways<br/>
&gt; to laugh about situations that have the potential to<br/>
&gt; make me cry.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The TV offers a connection to history and literature<br/>
&gt; and language and culture and differing opinions and<br/>
&gt; glimpses of remote parts of the world I will probably<br/>
&gt; never see in person.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I like to watch shows from my childhood...it is a<br/>
&gt; connection.  My kids learn more about me from what I<br/>
&gt; watched and liked when I was younger.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We&#39;ve learned how to cook new foods.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My husband, a busy, busy man, will actually sit with<br/>
&gt; us if we watch a show together, and he finds things<br/>
&gt; for him and the girls to watch together.  Major<br/>
&gt; bonding.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When my kids are in a &quot;TV phase&quot;, I like to look at it<br/>
&gt; as a great opportunity for me to catch up on<br/>
&gt; housework, phone calls, a new craft, or my sleep :).<br/>
&gt; These don&#39;t last long so instead of worrying I take<br/>
&gt; full advantage!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It really adds to our never-ending list of questions.<br/>
&gt; The topics take us to the library and on field trips<br/>
&gt; and into new artistic endeavors.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ooooh, and here&#39;s a really good one: TV topics are a<br/>
&gt; great conversation link between my kids and schooled<br/>
&gt; kids.  They can talk about favorite movies or shows or<br/>
&gt; actors or musicians.  These topics are much better<br/>
&gt; than, &quot;What grade are you in?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We have been introduced to so many fun games and toys<br/>
&gt; because of the *gasp* advertisements.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It gives me a cozy, tucked-in, home-from-school<br/>
&gt; feeling.  My kids don&#39;t really have that, but I&#39;m sure<br/>
&gt; sometimes they get a nest-y cozy feeling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It connects us generationally.  My kids can talk to<br/>
&gt; their grandparents about shows they mutually like and<br/>
&gt; they can watch them together.  My grandparents don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; go to the skating rinks and sledding hills and zoos<br/>
&gt; with us, but they can watch Mary Poppins with my kids<br/>
&gt; and laugh and bond together.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My Mom had the TV on all the time.  She loved it.  But<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t remember her sitting and just watching very<br/>
&gt; often. She crocheted and cooked and cleaned.  And she<br/>
&gt; and I both read in front of the TV.  I read many a<br/>
&gt; book in front of the TV just to be near her.  I did<br/>
&gt; most of my homework in front of the TV (and did really<br/>
&gt; well according to their standards).  And it still<br/>
&gt; gives me a chance to knit and paint my toes and other<br/>
&gt; things I like to do with some noise on.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And guess what, even though I have these feelings of<br/>
&gt; regard for the TV and tell my kids when their favorite<br/>
&gt; shows are on and get them lots of movies and offer to<br/>
&gt; go to lots of movies, they probably end up watching<br/>
&gt; the same amount of TV as some kids with TV limits<br/>
&gt; watch.  Because they *want* full lives and have many<br/>
&gt; interests and love the outdoors and art and<br/>
&gt; experiments and friends and going out to eat and well,<br/>
&gt; you get the idea.<br/>

Oh THAT&quot;S where that went!!  I pulled it up and it disappeared. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It was on this list, March 24.<br/>
<br/>
I was cleaning out the e-mail, and knew it was great, so I put it here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/t/learning">http://sandradodd.com/t/learning</a> (on an existing page in the TV  <br/>
section, which begins <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/tv">http://sandradodd.com/tv</a> and has some new art).<br/>
<br/>
I was going to announce it to my subscription-to-site-news list and  <br/>
didn&#39;t mean to send it here.  But I&#39;m not sorry.  Good accident.<br/>
<br/>
Problem is, I need several other small tales of something a kid  <br/>
learned from TV.  Could people here help me out?  I&#39;d love to fill up  <br/>
that page.<br/>
