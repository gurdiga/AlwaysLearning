<div id="ygrps-yiv-57339491">Hi everyone, <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I am a 29 year old play-at-home mama in CA.  I have two girls; ages 3 and 10<br/>
months.  I am married to my nerdy engineer hubby for 5 years now.  Our girls<br/>
are young yet, but we are very interested in homeschooling and unschooling.<br/>
I think it feels like the natural thing to move into from Attachment<br/>
Parenting.  I also had a great homebirth last year and I would like to teach<br/>
child-birth education one day.  I am a sponge for any information about<br/>
birth and breastfeeding.  I also love to cloth diaper and wear my baby in a<br/>
sling.  I am also a bible-loving Christian.  I am online frequently at<br/>
www.gentlechristianmothers.com &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.gentlechristianmothers.com/">http://www.gentlechristianmothers.com/</a>&gt;  as<br/>
&quot;BornFreeBaby&quot;.  There is a great homeschooling/ unschooling forum there<br/>
that has inspired me.  I have been reading some of John Holt, John Taylor<br/>
Gatto as well as Alfie Kohn.  I hope to learn as much as I can from all of<br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>

mature they are and if they feel they are ready.  I&#39;m assuming that if they<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1112660321">well I think the whole marriage thing comes to the whole if you marry early you are more likely to get  divorced  early in the marriage and more likely to to have to live with family or friends to make it and in my thought of marriage its a very adult thing to do and if you are an adult then you should be able to offer my daughter a places to live of thier own and be able to keep her at the up keep level that I keep her at.....meaning......if I pay for her nails to be done every other week then you should be able too...if I pay for her to have contacts then you should be able too....... and yes I know that the first years of marriage is hard and most people make it through great and with a new look on life but you should be able to do it on your own. IT drives me crazy when you see a married couple living with their mommy and daddy saying they are saving money for thier own place and all you see is them spending and always being broke. BUT if they were in love and and<br/>
 seemed like the real deal and then I think they would be able to wait until they are adults to do a very adult thing.  I got pregnant when I was 17 and we waited to get married until I was 18 so that I could make this my dicesion and not me begging my parents to sign for me and then My new husband asked my parents if I could stay there until he got us a house and about a week and a half we had a house and I moved out and he never stayed there.  I&#39;m going on and on but it is a very big decesion and if my child came to me  and wanted to be married I would tell them that they need to save for a house and car and a wedding and in the mean time they can be getting a good job or go to college and then when they were 18 then they would be ready to be men and take care of their wife.<br/>

fair or right.<br/>

Jennifer Martin, how old are your children?<br/>
Is this all entirely hypothetical, or a kneejerk reaction to your own  <br/>
teen pregnancy?<br/>
<br/>
Living a reactionary life, and worse yet, pressing a child into the  <br/>
mold of parental reaction, is damaging for the parent and the child  <br/>
both.  Maybe deal with your own personal issues internally and  <br/>
separate from your daughter.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-572122236">-=-Are you saying that in you opinion pregnant women need to get  <br/>

<br/>
If my daughter were pregnant and the father was willing to marry her,  <br/>
and she wanted that, I think it would be a need and not a fleeting  <br/>
desire.<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, a child should have both parents if that&#39;s a  <br/>
reasonable option.<br/>
<br/>
And there&#39;s a greater NEED to marry if there&#39;s a baby coming than if  <br/>
the kid just think it would be fun to live together separate from any  <br/>
parents (which is why many people get married).<br/>
<br/>
If a parent has left a child uninformed of the possible result of pre- <br/>
marital sex, how does that recommend the parent&#39;s qualifications to  <br/>
advise  her on anything else?<br/>
<br/>
To tell a pregnant girl and a soon-to-be-father that the child must  <br/>
be born outside a marriage because the mom (who&#39;s already shown some  <br/>
failure to pay attention) chooses that goes against my experience and  <br/>
belief.<br/>
<br/>
I thought the question was about experience and belief, and what  <br/>
anyone who wanted to respond thought she would do and why.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-Are you saying that in you opinion pregnant women need to get  <br/>
married?-=-<br/>
<br/>
It depends on the pregnant woman and who the father is.  Is the  <br/>
father already married?  Is he a relative or a minister or some other  <br/>
child abuser who shouldn&#39;t have been with the girl in the first place?<br/>
<br/>
A simple answer to a complex question is probably a bad answer.<br/>
A question about a hypothetical situation can only be well answered  <br/>
with &quot;it depends.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote> I see your point, but I guess it boils sown to what is the definition <br/>
of the word &quot;need&quot;! My opinion is that marriage is not really ever a <br/>
NEED (even for adults), but always a DESIRE.<br/>
But desire is not a negative thing!....and just because something is a <br/>
desire, it doesn&#39;t mean it is a &quot;fleeting&quot; desire,kwim?<br/>
I do agree though, that many parents treat teens patronizingly, and act <br/>
as if a their desires are fleeting desires simply because of their age.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If a parent has left a child uninformed of the possible result of pre-<br/>
&gt; marital sex, how does that recommend the parent&#39;s qualifications to<br/>
&gt; advise her on anything else?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You are right, it doesn&#39;t. Parents do have a right to advise their <br/>
children as they see fit...but unfortunately, and as you point out, the <br/>
way that they see fit is not always in the best interest of ,or <br/>
respectful towards, their child.<br/>
<br/>
But I do want to point out that its a presumption to automatically <br/>
assume that if a teen is pregnant, then her parents must have left her <br/>
uninformed of the possible result of premarital sex.<br/>
That is most definitely not always the case!<br/>
And even in this day and age, there are girls who feel that if they are <br/>
pregnant they &quot;should&quot; marry the father - even if they aren&#39;t really <br/>
sure that it would be the best thing for them relationally. I think its <br/>
part of that societal &quot;thing&quot; that women deal with -&quot;do whats right&quot;, <br/>
&quot;make others happy&quot;<br/>
IMO,a parent would be correct in advising the girl to be sure that she <br/>
really wants to marry the boy and is not wanting to simply because she <br/>
is pregnant.<br/>
A child can have both parents in their lives in an active,involved way - <br/>
even if the parents in question are not married. Its definitely harder, <br/>
but it is possible. If  my teen dd were pregnant, I&#39;d counsel her and <br/>
her bf to make sure that marriage is what they really wanted - if it <br/>
was, then I&#39;d support their decision.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; To tell a pregnant girl and a soon-to-be-father that the child must<br/>
&gt; be born outside a marriage because the mom (who&#39;s already shown some<br/>
&gt; failure to pay attention) chooses that goes against my experience and<br/>
&gt; belief.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I definitely get the scenario you are describing, and I agree with you <br/>
in that particular case -  but again, I don&#39;t believe that one can <br/>
always say with certainty that if a teen is pregnant, then the mother <br/>
has shown failure to pay attention.<br/>
I understand your point, because often that IS the case, but not always.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve told him that the reality is, that whatever child results from <br/>

Anyway, he&#39;s only 10, but my hope is talking about these things in a <br/>

to our soon 19 year old cousin on how to protect himself from that situation and<br/>
now he&#39;s hearing a lot about my 24 year old cousin&#39;s pregnancy.  Not as separate<br/>

the questions you asked me :-)<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote> I think you are misunderstanding me...or maybe I&#39;m not expressing <br/>
myself well. I wasn&#39;t AT ALL saying that I expected anyone to declare to <br/>
their child the difference between their wants and their needs in the <br/>
event that they were pregnant or wanted to marry (or in any event <br/>
really) I was responding to your words.....you  said ,or implied, that <br/>
if there was a pregnancy, there was a NEED for marriage.  In an almost <br/>
tangental point  I was expressing my thoughts on wants v/s needs. Maybe <br/>
this was an inappropriate venue for that?<br/>
I&#39;m not arguing with you on a personal level at all!. I&#39;m just <br/>
discussing the topic in general and your post brought up some points <br/>
that I wanted to discuss in a general way.<br/>
I totally support your validating your daughters desires/needs,  I do <br/>
that as well!.....however; I was simply saying that ,semantically <br/>
speaking, we humans often refer to our desires as needs.I guess I was <br/>
being overly semantic!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If a person feels that she would be being dishonest, immoral or<br/>
&gt; unfair in a situation, and decides she needs (for the maintenance of<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>again, I agree with your point, and you have a right to define the word <br/>
need anyway you want to (or need to!LOL!)  I think we actually agree on <br/>
the issue of respecting our children .  I have many strong desires that <br/>
in some ways are actually needs in terms of my sanity and well being -  <br/>
I totally  get your point. I don&#39;t think you are getting my point <br/>
though.  I wasn&#39;t disagreeing with you on the importance of validating <br/>
our children&#39;s desires/needs, I was simply, in my logical sequential <br/>
manner, defining the word &quot;need&quot;.... I guess the idea of someone NEEDing <br/>
to get married brought a different mental picture to mind. I pictured <br/>
someone feeling like they needed to simply because &quot;thats what people do <br/>
when they are pregnant&quot;  you know, the whole shotgun wedding <br/>
mentality....whether they really WANTED to marry the person or not.  It <br/>
seems as if you were coming from the viewpoint that the kids really <br/>
WANTED to marry...wanted to so much in fact that it can(and should) be <br/>
construed as a NEED.  I agree with you!Are you seeing where  I was <br/>
coming from more clearly now?<br/>

point and agree with it. But I was making a different point one sparked <br/>
by the idea that if a teen were pregnant, then her parents somehow where <br/>
uninvolved or didn&#39;t give her information or not paying attention.(which <br/>
is what you wrote in your post)<br/>
<br/>
I know people who got pregnant as a teen who&#39;s parents were involved in <br/>
their lives in a respectful,supportive manner (much like many of the <br/>
mom&#39;s on this list) and who did give their dd information about the <br/>
consequences of sex and info on birth control. Things happen..if 2 <br/>
people are having sex, no matter how well aware they are of the possible <br/>
consequences, even if they are using birth control, pregnancy can happen<br/>

 </span></blockquote>for the pregnant girl and her partner. My horribly articulated point was <br/>
that I know people who got married just because they were under the <br/>
impression(or told that) thats just what you do when you&#39;re pregnant. <br/>
They didn&#39;t realize that they had the choice to NOT marry the boy if <br/>
that was what they (the pregnant girl and/or the boy) felt was best for <br/>
them. As  I said in my previous post - it IS possible for both parents <br/>
to be actively a part of the baby&#39;s life even if they are not <br/>
married...not easy, but possible.<br/>
If the couple marry and the didn&#39;t really want to,and are constantly <br/>
angry and miserable,how is that best for the baby?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;whats right&quot; as defined by whom? My extended family felt that &quot;whats <br/>
right&quot; was to send my kids to school, in the first homeschool group I <br/>
joined &quot;whats right&quot; was deemed to mean school-at-home. I didn&#39;t do <br/>
&quot;whats right&quot; by their definition, thats the point I was trying to <br/>
make.  I was trying to say that some girls marry because it is &quot;whats <br/>
right&quot; by someone else&#39;s definition. My hope was that an involved parent <br/>
would help the girl realize she had to do &quot;whats right&quot; for herself, the <br/>
baby, and her partner.<br/>
<br/>
again, I obviously didn&#39;t make my point clearly in my last post. I <br/>
definitely expect my children to &quot;do whats right&quot; in the sense that  I <br/>
want them to care about others and do things that are <br/>
lawful,moral/ethical and respectful- even if it&#39;s the hard thing to <br/>
do.....although I don&#39;t think that others feelings are their <br/>
responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
I expect them to be respectful and supportive of others feelings,to care <br/>
about others happiness, to want the people that they are in relationship <br/>
to be happy, to do things that lead to their partners happiness even if <br/>
it can be a bit of a sacrifice for them....BUT ultimately each person is <br/>
responsible for their own feelings.<br/>
<br/>
 I wouldn&#39;t want my children to do or be something that is not in their <br/>
best interest ,or that is not true to their own nature just to make <br/>
their significant other or friends &quot;happy&quot;<br/>
I&#39;m thinking about how women have historically been taught to feel that <br/>
others happiness is more important than their own<br/>
Gavin DeBecker  touches on this in his book Protecting the gift. women  <br/>
are taught not to make waves,to smile and make nice, to do what is <br/>
expected of them, often to the detriment of their own safety ....Things <br/>
are changing (thankfully) but it is still prevalent in society<br/>
<br/>
So I wasn&#39;t implying that I wouldn&#39;t want my children to be nice people <br/>
or care about others feelings or that I wouldn&#39;t want them to do whats <br/>
right. I was trying to say that I wouldn&#39;t want them to marry simply <br/>
because they thought that it was expected of them.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Did anyone in this thread recommend advising a girl to marry a boy<br/>
&gt; she didn&#39;t want to marry?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>no, but someone in this thread (me) said that she is aware that some <br/>
people marry because they are pregnant - whether they really want to or not.<br/>
I also said that  I think its appropriate if the parent lets the child <br/>
know that she is accepted whether or not she chooses to marry and that <br/>
she only has to marry if she truly wants to.<br/>
So to clarify, I wasn&#39;t responding to anyone in this thread, I was <br/>
making my own point....not an accusatory point directed to anyone in <br/>
this thread, but a general point that was simply sharing my feelings on <br/>
the subject ...a point that I honestly felt the majority probably shared <br/>
given the nature of the group.  I had no idea that you would take it <br/>
so... I dunno, defensively?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-A child can have both parents in their lives in an active,involved<br/>
way -<br/>
even if the parents in question are not married. Its definitely harder,<br/>
but it is possible.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s possible to do it to the parent&#39;s guilt-reducing satisfaction,<br/>
but it will never be the same for the child to have one parent at a<br/>
time instead of, ever, both at once.<br/>
<br/>
And thats exactly what I meant. It IS possible, but much harder - for <br/>
all involved. I feel the same way about breastfeeding and positive <br/>
discipline lol!! Those are things that would be best for the child,their <br/>
birthright even -  but unfortunately not everyone will do them ( I <br/>
understand that there are valid reasons some people can&#39;t breastfeed - I <br/>
was referring to those who don&#39;t breastfeed because its&quot;icky&quot; or they <br/>
want their figure back or its just too hard,etc...)<br/>
<br/>
And as far as the parents guilt-reducing satisfaction, you have a point, <br/>
but there are many situations where its just as guilt reducing and <br/>
parent centered to marry if the parents don&#39;t really want to be married <br/>
or are abusive or neglectful....<br/>
 I think we are all in agreement that  happily married,loving,respectful <br/>
parents are the ideal foundation for a happy child. But having both <br/>
parents at once does not always mean that the child will be <br/>
happy,safe,or satisfied.  I can speak to that from my own growing up.<br/>
Having miserably unhappily married parents or a two parent, yet unsafe, <br/>
household is not going to be any more ideal than two non married parents <br/>
working hard to let their child know that they are loved and both of <br/>
those parents being an active, loving , involved part of the child&#39;s life.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know that I am articulating myself well here. Again, I feel that <br/>
- for the most part- we are in agreement! especially on the importance <br/>
of respecting our children and validating their needs and feelings.<br/>
 Sorry if I stepped on any toes, but I was just trying to share my <br/>
thoughts ,in a general way ,on an interesting topic.<br/>

different meanings and nuances and connotations for all of them.<br/>
<br/>
For a long time, longer than any of us could find or prove, adults  <br/>
have told children &quot;You don&#39;t NEED that,&quot; about things from toys to  <br/>
food to peace and safety.  I don&#39;t want to encourage any mother to  <br/>
pooh-pooh any child&#39;s perceived need.<br/>
<br/>
-=-&gt; If a person feels that she would be being dishonest, immoral or<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; unfair in a situation, and decides she needs (for the maintenance of<br/>
 &gt; her integrity and inner peace) to do something, then that is a need.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>-=-again, I agree with your point, and you have a right to define the  <br/>
word<br/>
need anyway you want to-=-<br/>
<br/>
That wasn&#39;t me defining the word.  That  was me using the word and  <br/>
explaining why I thought there could be a need to maintain integrity  <br/>
and peace.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I don&#39;t think you are getting my point<br/>
though. I wasn&#39;t disagreeing with you on the importance of validating<br/>
our children&#39;s desires/needs, I was simply, in my logical sequential<br/>
manner, defining the word &quot;need&quot;.... -=-<br/>
<br/>
I missed the logical sequential part, but it seems you&#39;re implying I  <br/>
was being neither.<br/>
It&#39;s okay (really!  it&#39;s great!) to proofread your posts and clarify  <br/>
them before sending them.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s better for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I pictured<br/>
someone feeling like they needed to simply because &quot;thats what people do<br/>
when they are pregnant&quot; you know, the whole shotgun wedding<br/>
mentality....whether they really WANTED to marry the person or not.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If you pictured that, it wasn&#39;t from the original question nor from  <br/>
what I wrote, because I said from the beginning it would depend on  <br/>
all kinds of factors.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Are you seeing where I was  coming from more clearly now?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Doesn&#39;t matter.  Be as clear as you can be each time you post, and  <br/>
don&#39;t try to insist that anyone agree or accept or affirm it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I know people who got pregnant as a teen who&#39;s parents were  <br/>
involved in their lives in a respectful,supportive manner (much like  <br/>
many of the mom&#39;s on this list)-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never known one yet, in my life.  What&#39;s theoretical, or what  <br/>
makes an argument sound good isn&#39;t as good as real personal  <br/>
information.   The list never does well with &quot;what if&quot; or &quot;I heard&quot;  <br/>
or &quot;oh sure, lots.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The original question was theoretical and philosophical, and my  <br/>
response was &quot;it depends.&quot;  The other points were discussion of  <br/>
discussion, and of why, and of the what-ifs.<br/>
<br/>
-=-&quot;whats right&quot; as defined by whom? My extended family felt that &quot;whats<br/>
right&quot; was to send my kids to school-=-<br/>
<br/>
Was it your family&#39;s decision, or did you, as the mom, do what you  <br/>
thought was right?<br/>
<br/>
If my daughter gets pregnant, if she&#39;s old enough to get pregnant  <br/>
(I&#39;m not talking rape of a little girl, I&#39;m talking consensual sex,  <br/>
which she&#39;s not having anyway, so this is still hypothetical), then  <br/>
SHE, the mother of that unborn baby, will be the one to do what she  <br/>
thinks is right.  She would ask for advice; she always has.  She  <br/>
would ask people besides me; she usually does.  I would advise her to  <br/>
ask particular others who had had such experiences.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I was trying to say that some girls marry because it is &quot;whats<br/>
right&quot; by someone else&#39;s definition.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I was writing about my family and my daughter, as that&#39;s what the  <br/>
question was.<br/>
<br/>
Some families force a girl to have a baby even if she wants an  <br/>
abortion.  Some families force an abortion when a girl wants the  <br/>
baby, or an adoption when the girl wants the baby.<br/>
We don&#39;t need to talk about that here, do we?<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s talk about unschoolers we know personally whenever possible.<br/>
<br/>
People won&#39;t join this list to hear mainstream advice and arguments.<br/>
<br/>
-=-BUT ultimately each person is<br/>
responsible for their own feelings.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Is an infant responsible for his own feelings?<br/>
Is a five year old responsible for his own feelings?<br/>
Is a frightened, pregnant 16 year old responsible for her own feelings?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind a BIT giving more to my children than I get back.<br/>
I don&#39;t mind giving them more than I had.<br/>

that I wasn&#39;t.<br/>
In other words, I have no problem with you (or anyone) disagreeing with <br/>
me or not understanding what I wrote. I&#39;ve been unschooling for many <br/>
years and have been around on line for a long time - I have a thick <br/>
skin!lol!  You responded specifically to my post and I was just <br/>
responding back.<br/>
And its because , as you said, lots of people are reading  that I don&#39;t <br/>

me, I want it to be a disagreement with what I actually said/meant ,kwim?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote> I did proofread my post (really!) . I was happy with it, still am! :-)<br/>
I only tried to clarify later since you seemed to be so upset by my <br/>
words. I tried to clarify because you responded to me directly and I <br/>
wanted to convey to you that  I was not arguing with you.<br/>
I&#39;m sorry that you seem to have taken offense with me/my post.   I don&#39;t <br/>
understand why, but then again,I don&#39;t need to understand why!<br/>

I never,EVER insinuated that a parent should tell a child that their <br/>

that a parent should not present their own wants to a child as needs! <br/>
clear as mud?!<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote> Actually,I pictured it from what you wrote &quot;and in the event of a <br/>
pregnancy, the NEED to get married&quot;<br/>
Again, I was making a point in general.  I get that you didn&#39;t mean it <br/>
in that way. I said what  I did because -although YOU may not think of <br/>
the idea of &quot;needing&quot; to get married in a shotgun wedding type way, <br/>
others might.... I did!<br/>
 I wasn&#39;t insinuating that you were promoting that idea.<br/>
Just as you shared YOUR feelings on the idea of letting them marry,or <br/>
their need to be married in the event of a pregnancy, I was sharing <br/>
mine. ...you seem to be upset that I disagree with you.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

&gt; don&#39;t try to insist that anyone agree or accept or affirm it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>ditto :-) <br/>
 I have no issue with how clear I was originally. I felt that my post <br/>
was clear and made sense...I still feel that it does.  I wasn&#39;t <br/>
insisting that anyone agree, Nor was I  looking for or wanting <br/>
affirmation.  I clarified because you asked for clarification by <br/>
questioning me.  :-)<br/>
 I was sharing my thoughts on the topic. For some reason you seemed to <br/>
think that  by doing so,  I was devaluing yours. I wasn&#39;t.  Judging from <br/>
your response, it looked like you didn&#39;t understand what I had written <br/>
so I was clarifying for you.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t expect everyone to agree with me, but I also don&#39;t want my words <br/>
to be misconstrued. So if you or anyone else implies that what I&#39;m <br/>
saying runs counter to what I &#39;m actually saying/meaning/believe then <br/>
I&#39;m going to speak up and correct that.<br/>

information is true and not at all theoretical. Not a  &quot;what if&quot; not a <br/>
&quot;I heard&quot; She was a dear friend of mine and I knew her in high school as <br/>
the event was happening. How odd that you&#39;d imply otherwise. Her parents <br/>
were wonderful, involved,respectful. The paid attention to her and her <br/>
needs and wants and more importantly her as a person. She had lots of <br/>
information about sex and birth control. A broken condom on her first <br/>
time having sex resulted in a pregnant 17yo. (and that pregnancy <br/>
resulted in a wonderful little baby who is now 26 and has 2 children of <br/>
his own!!)<br/>
 I don&#39;t think I was speaking in the abstract any more than you or <br/>
anyone else on the list was.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t mind a BIT giving more to my children than I get back.<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t mind giving them more than I had.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Me either. I feel *exactly* the same way.  And everything I wrote in my <br/>
previous post supports that.<br/>
 I never said or even implied that a parent should not try to make their <br/>
child happy. Or that a parent should force a child to navigate their <br/>
scary feelings alone. implying that I&#39;m saying something that I&#39;m not.<br/>
<br/>
What  I wrote about not being responsible for others feelings stems from <br/>
the reality that lot of times people will do things for their friends or <br/>
significant others that are not in their own best interest because they <br/>
don&#39;t want them to be unhappy or angry. And this is not hypothetical or <br/>
&quot;what if&quot; or &quot;I heard&quot;. Its real. And it stems from this unschooling <br/>
moms life experience :-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tried to teach my children that although they are to be respectful <br/>
of other peoples feelings, and make an effort to be kind and caring to <br/>
others and support their friends even at the cost of an occasional <br/>
sacrifice, they are not solely responsible for another persons happiness.<br/>
 DD shouldn&#39;t feel that she should give up a long awaited visit with <br/>
grandma just because it would make her best friend sad or angry to be <br/>
&quot;left alone&quot; for the weekend. Its not dd&#39;s job to stop best friend from <br/>
being sad/angry about it.she&#39;s not responsible for her friends feelings.<br/>
It wasn&#39;t my responsibility as a battered girlfriend to make sure my ex <br/>
wasn&#39;t angry. I was not responsible for his feelings.<br/>
THAT is the point I was making. take it or leave it, agree or don&#39;t. Its <br/>
a valid point.<br/>

<br/>
Oh.  No.  I would no more &quot;make&quot; her than prevent her, but sometimes  <br/>
it&#39;s more than just a desire or a &#39;want.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
The question was originally asked from the point of view of rules-- <br/>
what&#39;s the &quot;rule,&quot; would we sign for an early marriage or not?  I  <br/>
still have no answer on whether the original questioner even had  <br/>
teens, I don&#39;t think.<br/>
<br/>
When living by principles, though, the answer (and the question) look  <br/>
altogether different.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I never said or even implied that a parent should not try to make  <br/>
their<br/>
child happy. -=-<br/>
<br/>
You wrote: &quot;BUT ultimately each person is responsible for their own  <br/>
feelings&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think an infant is responsible for his own feelings.  I think  <br/>
the mom is.  I think the balance changes gradually over time, but any  <br/>
blanket statement without qualification can be a problem.<br/>
<br/>
Later there was a qualification:  &quot;they are not solely responsible  <br/>
for another persons happiness.&quot;  Qualifications (not solely; I think;  <br/>
it seems; generally) are really, really good things.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I wouldn&#39;t want my children to do or be something that is not in  <br/>
their<br/>
best interest ,or that is not true to their own nature just to make<br/>
their significant other or friends &quot;happy&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
In a whole-life way I wouldn&#39;t either.<br/>
In various very-short-term ways, I would.  I wouldn&#39;t put quotation  <br/>
marks on &quot;happy,&quot; but let it be REAL, acceptable happiness.<br/>
<br/>
It goes against my nature to go to steak houses, but my husband  <br/>
really likes them sometimes, and so if I do something that&#39;s not true  <br/>
to my own nature to make him happy, it&#39;s an investment in our  <br/>
relationship.   Many moms come to this list and say they HATE this or  <br/>
that, that their child likes.  Others here try to persuade them to  <br/>
reconsider, and to go against their natures to make their child  <br/>
happy.  It&#39;s an investment in the future of that relationship.<br/>
<br/>
But if the first thing we said was &quot;don&#39;t do what you don&#39;t want to  <br/>
do; their happiness is their own responsibility,&quot; the list would be  <br/>
dwindling instead of growing, and people would be giving up on  <br/>
unschooling because it wouldn&#39;t work as well if people weren&#39;t  <br/>
encouraging them to go TOWARD their children, to sacrifice what they  <br/>
think is their right and their due (a silent TV-free house; time to  <br/>
themselves; freedom from hearing about Spongebob Squarepants or  <br/>
whatever it might be).<br/>
<br/>
-=-I was trying to say that I wouldn&#39;t want them to marry simply<br/>
because they thought that it was expected of them.-=-<br/>
<br/>
And I was saying there&#39;s no &quot;simply.&quot;<br/>
There&#39;s no simple answer, and it would matter to me TOTALLY what my  <br/>
daughter wanted to do, and why.<br/>
And if she felt she needed to get married, that would be a need, not  <br/>
just a choice as any other choice.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I know people who got pregnant as a teen who&#39;s parents were  <br/>
involved in<br/>
their lives in a respectful,supportive manner (much like many of the<br/>
mom&#39;s on this list) and who did give their dd information about the<br/>
consequences of sex and info on birth control-=-<br/>
<br/>
This turned out to be one girl, and not an unschooler.<br/>
That&#39;s important to me.<br/>
<br/>
-=-. My horribly articulated point was<br/>
that I know people who got married just because they were under the<br/>
impression(or told that) thats just what you do when you&#39;re pregnant.<br/>
They didn&#39;t realize that they had the choice to NOT marry the boy if<br/>
that was what they (the pregnant girl and/or the boy) felt was best for<br/>
them. -=-<br/>
<br/>
The original question was about parental permission.<br/>
In some cases (many, in the past hundreds of years), they did not  <br/>
have that choice, if the parents on both sides said &quot;You&#39;re getting  <br/>
married now.&quot;    The idea of giving children choices is rare.  That&#39;s  <br/>
why we discuss it so much. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t want to dig it out now, but I really liked what Sandra said a few<br/>
posts ago about sacrificing for others.<br/>
<br/>
This movement of promoting people taking care of their own needs<br/>
first...making sure their needs are met before they look at others&#39;<br/>
needs...has always been a little disturbing to me. Not because I&#39;m a martyr<br/>
and think we need ignore our individual desires/needs, but because the<br/>
message itself promotes selfishness, and seems to endanger the natural<br/>
desire to help others.<br/>
<br/>
If people actually putting other people first regularly, I think the result<br/>
would be that more people&#39;s needs were met than if they were all thinking of<br/>
themselves first. Just a theory.<br/>
<br/>
It may seem like a good thing to &quot;teach&quot; our children that they are not<br/>
responsible for other people&#39;s happiness, but I think it is much more<br/>
rewarding in life to see what makes another person happy, and acting on that<br/>
information. My children have given up things they wanted, like a trip to<br/>
grandma&#39;s, to make friends/siblings/pets/family happy. They made those<br/>
decisions themselves, and I&#39;m not convinced those decisions weren&#39;t just the<br/>
perfect things at the time. It seems like amazing compassion to me!<br/>
<br/>
If they were brooding around unhappy because they were just giving up<br/>
everything they wanted, that would be another thing. I don&#39;t see that, so<br/>
can&#39;t speak to it personally.<br/>
<br/>
I like the model that unschooling brings of giving, giving, giving.<br/>

<br/>
 From my experience, those people who say &quot;I&#39;m taking care of MY  <br/>
needs&quot; end up being alone and lonely and frustrated.<br/>
I have one friend I&#39;ve known since our oldest two were babies.  She&#39;s  <br/>
BIG into taking care of herself, and keeps on (and on) reminding us.   <br/>
So I don&#39;t feel the urge to help her, because she assures people she  <br/>
doesn&#39;t need any help.  But then there&#39;s no basis for the  <br/>
relationship after a while.  We have no ebb and flow, no favors done,  <br/>
no minor indebtednesses.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s harsher with her kids than I am with mine, and assures herself,  <br/>
aloud, that it&#39;s for their own good.<br/>
They&#39;re not as open and honest with her as mine are with me.<br/>
<br/>
One of the most surprising things to me about having teens is how  <br/>
gentle and sweet they can be, how concerned about my feelings and  <br/>
preferences.  I didn&#39;t expect it, but looking back over the way they  <br/>
were treated when they were younger and needier of approval and  <br/>
freedom and sympathy, I see it come flooding back out of them.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; be as slow and patient with them as I tried to be  <br/>
(and I failed sometimes, certainly, losing my temper and being too  <br/>
tired to turn and give them a big dose of attention now and then).  I  <br/>
didn&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; and nobody made me, and most of my friends and  <br/>
relatives would&#39;ve applauded me had I gone a more traditional route  <br/>
(because it would have made them feel more comfortable about their  <br/>
own choices).   It was a choice, but once I knew what kind of  <br/>
homelife and relationship I wanted with them, it was an easy choice.   <br/>
It became a need, to maintain the environment that had grown from all  <br/>
our earlier choices and actions.<br/>
<br/>
Could I &quot;choose&quot; now to move toward a harsher and less generous  <br/>
stance?  Could I say, now, &quot;You&#39;re responsible for your own  <br/>
happiness&quot;?  There is an up side to that, and they all do know ways  <br/>
to be more at peace and to view the world from a more positive  <br/>
position.  But there&#39;s a mean cutting off of people sometimes when  <br/>
someone says &quot;I&#39;m not responsible for... &quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Responsible&quot; means answerable.  You should be required to respond  <br/>
and to answer for your decisions.<br/>
<br/>
If one of my children felt afraid, unhappy, insecure, unloved, would  <br/>
I be &quot;responsible&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
If I want to be a responsible person, how else could I be?<br/>

of course,  thats very different than teaching our kids that its not <br/>

make someone happy, we can give up our percieved needs for the sake of <br/>
someone else,we can sacrifice for the sake of building relationship, we <br/>
can put others first,  we can try to help someone who is not happy be <br/>
happy - but if someone is feeling sad or angry thats ok too. our <br/>
feelings are always ok.   We can support them in their sadness or <br/>
validate their anger or whatever, but its not our job to make sure no <br/>
one else *ever* feels angry or sad. We are enriched by having a full <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes! I like the way you put that! I totally agree!<br/>
Meeting others needs is such a huge component of what makes unschooling <br/>
work - wouldn&#39;t our society be awesome if everyone did that!?<br/>
What better way to teach that to our kids than to model it by validating <br/>
and meeting their needs.&lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m really not trying to pick on you, honestly.<br/>
<br/>
But not all feelings are equally okay.  Joy is better than fury.   <br/>
When fury comes it&#39;s probably better (physically, emotionally and  <br/>
socially) for a mom to help a child turn that to something more  <br/>
positive than to validate it.  Sometimes anger isn&#39;t as &quot;valid&quot; as  <br/>
other times.<br/>
<br/>
Some people can get into the habit of feeling that others SHOULD be  <br/>
nicer to them, and others are MEAN and the world SUCKS, and sometimes  <br/>
parents agree with them instead of saying &quot;Let&#39;s figure out some ways  <br/>
you can feel better and get along more happily.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m predicting an &quot;of course that&#39;s exactly what I meant,&quot; so I&#39;m  <br/>
requesting looking at posts to make sure you wanted to state things  <br/>
in such definite, inflexible, unqualified ways as &quot;Our feelings are  <br/>
always ok.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes kids have misinterpreted something horribly, or they&#39;re  <br/>
feeling sick and are showing it by saying irrational things, or  <br/>
they&#39;re being selfish and unreasonable about a situation and could  <br/>
use going for a walk with mom (for the protection of their  <br/>
relationship with a sibling, in the scenario that sprang to mind).   <br/>
Letting one of them vent to me about another one of them, and  <br/>
discussing what seems right and true, and what seems exaggerated and  <br/>
reactionary is common.  &quot;Validate&quot; sounds too much to me like  <br/>
agreeing, condoning, supporting an emotion.  Some emotions do better  <br/>
NOT to be maintained for any length of time.<br/>
<br/>
I agree strongly that people are enriched by having a full spectrum  <br/>
of emotions.  A couple of times over the years I&#39;ve talked about  <br/>
things like humility as an emotion modern people rarely have, and  <br/>
both times moms jumped in and said they didn&#39;t want their kids to  <br/>
feel humble. &lt;g&gt;  There are emotions involving awe and wonder that  <br/>
used to be covered by miracle stories in church, or other religions  <br/>
experiences, and lots of families (and lots of churches) have lost  <br/>
those opportunities.  I think opportunities to experience all kinds  <br/>
of biochemical &quot;sets&quot; can be illuminating and make people more whole  <br/>
and aware, but I don&#39;t recommend inducing terror.   Discussing it,  <br/>
talking about adrenaline rushes and people being so afraid that they  <br/>
die on the spot or their hair goes white... that&#39;s interesting, but  <br/>
not to be exercised for practice. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-927550232">&lt;&lt;&lt;It&#39;s always amazing to me that parents in this day and age *don&#39;t*  <br/>
have these<br/>
kinds of matter-of-fact conversations about sex.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Our car conversation from the other day:<br/>
<br/>
Addi (12):  Mom, when I was talking with Jane*, she asked me if I had  <br/>
&quot;it&quot; yet?  She said &quot;it&quot; was great.  And I couldn&#39;t tell if she was  <br/>
talking about...<br/>
<br/>
Luke (8) from the back seat:  What?  Her period or sex?<br/>
<br/>
Addi:  Yeah, that&#39;s what I was thinking, but I couldn&#39;t understand  <br/>
from her excitement about how great *it* was, what she was talking  <br/>
about.  I asked her, but she mumbled and I couldn&#39;t hear her again.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sitting there thinking that I have an 8 yo boy who knows enough  <br/>
about sex and periods to talk about it with his 12 yo sister and  <br/>
parents.  And that he&#39;s most likely not going to be freaked out by or  <br/>
ignorant of periods and other sexual matters in the future because of  <br/>
these conversations.<br/>
<br/>
*Jane - ficticious name of a homeschooled kid, not unschooler.<br/>

<br/>
I haven&#39;t run into the situation with any of my four kids (all teenagers)<br/>
where one of them thought it was their job to assure no one else ever feels<br/>
sad, angry, etc. I&#39;m assuming this is a hypothetical, or has this been a<br/>
problem for anyone?<br/>
<br/>
It seems like that may be more likely to happen if there were adults forcing<br/>
children to think of others first, rather than children discovering what<br/>
compassion is in their lives.<br/>

I learned last night that a friend of Kirby&#39;s had offered him free  <br/>
rent, free everything, if Kirby would just come and live with him  <br/>
because the guy&#39;s wife had left (Kirby was one of the groomsmen at  <br/>
their wedding in May) and the guy was &quot;afraid he&#39;d kill himself.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the kind of offer I wouldn&#39;t have passed up, if I was Kirby&#39;s  <br/>
age.<br/>
He hadn&#39;t even mentioned it to me.<br/>
<br/>
It didn&#39;t keep him from talking to the guy by phone, and I don&#39;t know  <br/>
the details of what he told him when he didn&#39;t move in with him.<br/>

One of the funniest things I&#39;ve seen for a long time is a scene in  <br/>
Talladega Nights in which Michael Clarke Duncan with his manly  <br/>
exterior and BIG deep voice is reading aloud, to his (likewise manly)  <br/>
unconscious friend in the hospital, from Are You There God? It&#39;s Me,  <br/>
Margaret by Judy Blume, a passage about the other girls starting  <br/>
their periods, and how awful it will be to be the last one.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a pretty terrible movie, but some of the scenes are great, and  <br/>
THAT one is priceless.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a link to an online sex ed collection here.  There are other  <br/>
things some people here might be curious about, or needing.  I&#39;ll  <br/>
just leave it here quietly, as if in the bathroom, and I&#39;ll say no more.<br/>
