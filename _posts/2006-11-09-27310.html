<div id="ygrps-yiv-1893362938">my 5 year old has been difficult to understand for a long time.  for <br/>
along time he didnt seem to care and since we mostly understood him <br/>
we didnt worry about it.  his speech has become clearer, however, he <br/>
still has difficulty making himself understood with his peers. he is <br/>
very social and lately has been showing a desire to make friends <br/>
rather than just play with whoever is around (he does that to).  a <br/>
few months ago i had him tested for speech and he went along with <br/>
the whole thing and started going once a week.  i think it has <br/>
helped some and at first he didnt mind.  for the last two weeks <br/>
though he has been kind of complaining.  truthfully it started after <br/>
i had a discussion with him about letting me know if some of his <br/>
activities were not to his liking.  he used to go to this playgroup <br/>
with his brother where the mothers would take turns hosting it and <br/>
the other mothers could leave.  some of the mothers structure things <br/>
alot and Nathaniel wasnt really happy about it and never said <br/>
anything but i saw more issues with his behavior and when we talked <br/>
about it he let me know. He doenst go to that anymore but his <br/>
brother still likes it. Anyway, back to speech,  so since i told him <br/>
to let me know cause he doesnt have to do these things he told me he <br/>
doesnt like to go to speech.  but he went.  THis past week I asked <br/>
him what he didnt like and he said the teacher (speech path) wouldnt <br/>
let him play a game till the end but he thought he should get to <br/>
play one in the beginning.  so i suggested he tell her that and see <br/>
what happens.  he went off happily and came back saying he had more <br/>
fun.  i dont know if he told her or not but he was happier.  Anyway, <br/>
i am not sure how i should proceed with this.  I cant just let him <br/>
descide each week as this therapist gets paid when she sees him and <br/>
not when she doesnt so we have to either commit to it or not.  I <br/>
feel strongly about just canceling things like that at the last <br/>
minute cause I used to work like that and it costs the therapist <br/>
money to have no shows.</div>

&gt;&gt;i am not sure how i should proceed with this.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not sure I have any advice, but I do have a related story.<br/>
<br/>
I have a 12 yo whose speech was very difficult to understand for years as<br/>
well. It was fairly understandable by age 5, but not for everyone, and there<br/>
were definite issues with a number of sounds. I had played lots of games<br/>
over his life that incorporated speech therapy to help, but never made a big<br/>
deal about it.<br/>
<br/>
When he was about 9 he said he wanted to get help with his speech. I had<br/>
talked a little about speech therapy to him before, just so he knew that it<br/>
was an option.<br/>
<br/>
He went to the weekly speech sessions for about 6 months and then said he<br/>
wasn&#39;t getting anything out of it and could do the exercises at home if he<br/>
wanted (which I don&#39;t think he did unless he did them privately). He also<br/>
said he didn&#39;t get why they would do these monotonous exercises for most of<br/>
the time and the &quot;reward&quot; at the end was to play a game. Why couldn&#39;t they<br/>
play a game throughout? Wouldn&#39;t that make the exercises go more easily?<br/>
Those were his questions. We did some at home at his request, and his speech<br/>
did improve over this period of time because he wanted to work on it.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, ds has guided his own course with his speech and does not<br/>
appear to have any esteem issues. He still has a slight speech impediment,<br/>
not much though. He has no problem telling people he has a speech problem<br/>
when they notice it. In particular, when he is playing Xbox live with people<br/>
from all over the world, I&#39;ll hear him say things like, &quot;No I&#39;m not from<br/>
England. I have a speech impediment&quot;. Doesn&#39;t seem to bother him or anyone<br/>
else. The just continue on matter-of-fact as far as I can tell.<br/>

If my only two options were 1) send him to speech despite his reservation or <br/>

some of my other options or does anyone else have experience with this and <br/>

years.  I might just do that.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I used to get paid on that kind of basis, too - its one of the risks <br/>
one takes. If one wants commitment, one requires payment for x <br/>
number of classes/sessions. Let the therapist know that you <br/>
are &quot;just trying it&quot; on a week-to-week basis and its your son who is <br/>
ultimately going to make the decision. <br/>
<br/>
Can you go with him and get an idea of what is actually going on? At <br/>
one poing my dd was going to a music class with a girlfriend and the <br/>
other girl&#39;s mom was taking them. When Mo started complaining about <br/>
the class I went to a couple to find out what was going on - it was <br/>
one of those situations where she would say she didn&#39;t like it <br/>
before the class but that she had fun *after*. So I went and sat in <br/>
another room so I could listen in. It was &quot;fun&quot; in the coaxing-<br/>
children-to-have-fun sort of way, so I was able to understand the <br/>
mixed messages I was getting. We cancelled the class. <br/>
<br/>
So if you could go - I know you have another kid, but can you bring <br/>
a game or book or movie for the other kid so you can at least listen <br/>
in? That way if your son needs help communicating his needs to the <br/>
therapist you can help him out, in addition to keeping an ear open <br/>
for problems.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-870657475">Hi. I also have a speech delayed son. He is 3 1/2 and, like you, <br/>
wasn&#39;t concerned about him not talking all that much myself... <br/>
Untill his Grandmother (my husbands mother) suggested we get him <br/>
evaluated for speech therapy since she was concerned... I can&#39;t tell <br/>
you how many nights after that I beat myself up mentally, trying to <br/>
figure out where I&#39;d gone &#39;wrong&#39; and why he wasn&#39;t speaking as much <br/>
as other three year olds etc etc etc... We got him evaluated and <br/>
they recommended therapy, but we can&#39;t start untill January. I, <br/>
since that time, have been making a more concentrated effort to help <br/>
him improve his speech (buying flash cards of words, going through <br/>
pic books and, instead of reading them outright, just talking about <br/>
what is in the pics etc). He&#39;s acutally improving quite a bit. I <br/>
guess I am pretty laid back about most &#39;mothering&#39; things... I am <br/>
new to the unschooling concept, but realize that I&#39;ve been <br/>
practicing it all along. (I also have a two yr old girl) I generally <br/>
just play with the kids, cook with the kids, take the kids with me <br/>
where I go, sleep (co-sleep) with the kids etc... It&#39;s driven my MIL <br/>
kind of crazy, &#39;cause I think she thinks I am too &#39;attached&#39; to them <br/>
and honestly I think she blames this for my son&#39;s speech delay... <br/>
Since having discovered this posting board and others, I am feeling <br/>
much more comfortable in my own skin as a Mommy. I guess I got off <br/>
the subject of speech didn&#39;t I? My point? I think, from what I&#39;ve <br/>
read, that speech delay seems to be more common than I realized for <br/>
sure. I think perhaps my staying home w/ my son since birth and <br/>
knowing him so well allows him to do many things &#39;in his own time&#39; <br/>
and speaking is one of them. I know what he wants 95% of the time <br/>
and so it&#39;s not been an issue. I suppose I&#39;ll take him to the <br/>
therapy and see how it goes. I&#39;ve only recently (in the past few <br/>
weeks) decided to unschool/homeschool my kids [took me a long time <br/>
to come to that decision, as you can imagine my MIL is not thrilled <br/>
or supportive] and, since I no longer have school looming on the <br/>
horizon like a dark cloud, I am not as worried about it as I was. I <br/>
know he&#39;ll talk sometime, in his own time. I just try and let that <br/>
be enough for me. I don&#39;t know if any of that helped, but I am up w/ <br/>
insomnia so hopefully something coherent will have come out of it. <br/>

your son&#39;s life calmer.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
They don&#39;t make money if they don&#39;t recommend therapy.<br/>

<br/>
Flash cards of words?  He&#39;s 3 1/2.  Aren&#39;t there things all over your  <br/>
house and neighborhood to talk about?   Talk with him.  Don&#39;t just  <br/>
talk to him, have conversations.  Ask him questions, but not teacher- <br/>
style questions.  Play little games with him.  Play with words.  Use  <br/>
different words for things, talk about whether something is a tree or  <br/>
a bush, or a puppy or a dog, or a chair or a stool.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I am  new to the unschooling concept, but realize that I&#39;ve been<br/>
practicing it all along.-=-<br/>
<br/>
With a two and three year old, what you&#39;ve been practicing is  <br/>
mothering infants and toddlers.  Attachment parenting, maybe.  That&#39;s  <br/>
all great, but your kid could still go to school at five, so what  <br/>
you&#39;re doing is parenting.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Since having discovered this posting board and others, I am feeling<br/>
much more comfortable in my own skin as a Mommy. I guess I got off<br/>
the subject of speech didn&#39;t I?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Not really, because what you&#39;re on is the idea of confidence and  <br/>
patience and accepting children&#39;s learning patterns even when they&#39;re  <br/>
different.  You seem to be writing about fear, guilt, and how your  <br/>
mother in law feels more than about how your child feels.<br/>
<br/>
You say he&#39;s learning quite a bit.  Let that be your focus.<br/>
<br/>
-=-. I suppose I&#39;ll take him to the<br/>
therapy and see how it goes.-=-<br/>
<br/>
You already feel strongly that you&#39;ve done something wrong.  Taking  <br/>
him to professionals who will treat him like he&#39;s dong something  <br/>
wrong isn&#39;t your only option.<br/>
<br/>
People learn in their own ways and in their own time.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I  know he&#39;ll talk sometime, in his own time. I just try and let  <br/>
that<br/>
be enough for me.-=-<br/>
<br/>
He won&#39;t learn in his own time if you take him to therapy.  They will  <br/>
TELL you what he &quot;should&quot; know and their timetable will have to do  <br/>
with school.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some things that might help you consider how to make his  <br/>
life richer and more peaceful:<br/>

ready.  So, I waited.  I read a book called &quot;Late Talking Children&quot; by<br/>
Thomas          , who theorized that late-talkers were often gifted<br/>

other parts of the brain at that moment.  That helped.  I made lists of<br/>
words she used, words she made up, words she mispronounced and realized she<br/>
was talking in her own way.  She also had her own sign language to convey<br/>
her needs and wants.  We surrounded her with words by reading to her,<br/>
watching TV and movies, and talking to her and with her.<br/>

where I go, sleep (co-sleep) with the kids etc... It&#39;s driven my MIL <br/>
<br/>
kind of crazy, &#39;cause I think she thinks I am too &#39;attached&#39; to them <br/>
<br/>
and honestly I think she blames this for my son&#39;s speech delay... <br/>
<br/>
Since having discovered this posting board and others, I am feeling <br/>
<br/>
much more comfortable in my own skin as a Mommy. I guess I got off <br/>
<br/>
the subject of speech didn&#39;t I? My point? I think, from what I&#39;ve <br/>
<br/>
read, that speech delay seems to be more common than I realized for <br/>
<br/>
sure. I think perhaps my staying home w/ my son since birth and <br/>
<br/>
knowing him so well allows him to do many things &#39;in his own time&#39; <br/>
<br/>
and speaking is one of them. I know what he wants 95% of the time <br/>
<br/>
and so it&#39;s not been an issue. I suppose I&#39;ll take him to the <br/>
<br/>
therapy and see how it goes. I&#39;ve only recently (in the past few <br/>
<br/>
weeks) decided to unschool/homeschool my kids [took me a long time <br/>
<br/>
to come to that decision, as you can imagine my MIL is not thrilled <br/>
<br/>
or supportive] and, since I no longer have school looming on the <br/>
<br/>
horizon like a dark cloud, I am not as worried about it as I was. I <br/>
<br/>
know he&#39;ll talk sometime, in his own time. I just try and let that <br/>
<br/>
be enough for me. I don&#39;t know if any of that helped, but I am up w/ <br/>
<br/>
insomnia so hopefully something coherent will have come out of it. <br/>

<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &quot;&gt;This is how:   &quot;I cant just let him descide each week as this <br/>
<br/>
therapist <br/>
<br/>
&gt; gets<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt;paid when she sees him and<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt;not when she doesnt so we have to either commit to it or not.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt;It sounds like you care more about how the therapist feels about <br/>
<br/>
a missed<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt;week than you care about letting your son choose which weeks to <br/>
<br/>
go.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; yea, i can see that..thanks for pointing that out.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;You could pay the therapist for weeks he misses.  If he&#39;s <br/>
<br/>
missing more <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt;than<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt;he&#39;s going then you could cancel.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I actually cant pay the therapist anything (except the 5 dollar <br/>
<br/>
copay). The <br/>
<br/>
&gt; state is paying for it... i cant afford it.  But i did like the <br/>
<br/>
idea of <br/>
<br/>
&gt; letting her know we might miss some weeks cause it is up to my son <br/>
<br/>
and if <br/>
<br/>
&gt; she wants to drop us she can.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1676489143">Hello again.<br/>
<br/>
I decided to give myself a few days to let all the comments and <br/>
ideas &#39;digest&#39;... Since there were so many, it was like eating a <br/>
large Thanksgiving Meal and it took a while for it all to digest and <br/>
me to feel comfortable again and answer! LOL! <br/>
<br/>
I think you were right, Sandra, when you said:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You seem to be writing about fear, guilt, and how your mother in <br/>
law feels more than about how your child feels.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My first feelings after I read it were &#39;defensiveness&#39; and &#39;denial&#39;, <br/>
but after sitting with it a few days, I think it&#39;s &#39;cause you hit on <br/>
some truth. I am generally a bit too worried about what other people <br/>
think of me and need to &#39;get over it&#39; in order to become a more <br/>
effectual mother to my kids. <br/>
<br/>
My son is very bright and sweet and is wanting to learn things all <br/>
the time. You said to talk to him about things we are doing and <br/>
living instead of the flash cards... I guess I just went out and <br/>
bought them in a &#39;worried moment&#39; thinking that &#39;traditional <br/>
learning supplies&#39; were needed. We do talk all the time, he in his <br/>
own language a lot, but I understand him, so that&#39;s what counts. He <br/>
loves to learn. We make pancakes together every morning and wash <br/>
dishes (he&#39;d rather do that, help me, than to watch TV or play?!) <br/>
and he &#39;talks&#39; to me the whole time we are doing that. So I guess <br/>
the reason I am responding is to say that I agree that I need to <br/>
worry less, talk to him more and trust that his timetables for <br/>
learning to talk are &#39;right&#39; for him.<br/>
<br/>
I will continue to read all I can find about homeschool and unschool <br/>
and in the meantime, just enjoy being Mommy to my two little <br/>
miracles. <br/>
<br/>
Happy Thanksgiving!<br/>
Smiles, <br/>
Heather<br/>

<br/>
 What a great idea! Thanks. I even have a &#39;digital recording device&#39; <br/>
(not sure the real name of this little device, my hubby&#39;s the techno <br/>
wizard of the family) and I could use it! The funniest part is, <br/>
since we had him &#39;evaluated&#39;, he&#39;s improved by leaps and bounds on <br/>
his own... At least, as far as I am concerned he has. His newest <br/>
utterance (new to him and it makes me grin everytime he says it <br/>
since he&#39;s never been a real talker) is &quot;Mine!!!&quot; or &#39;My toy&#39; (or <br/>
whatever) Music to my ears, being that he&#39;s never really said such <br/>
things before. I&#39;ve had people tell me, when they noticed he wasn&#39;t <br/>
a real talker, that &#39;wait till he does start to talk, you&#39;ll miss <br/>
the silence&#39;... Bah! I LOVE HEARING his ideas and thoughts and his <br/>
almost constant questioning of &quot;What&#39;s this?That?&quot; that he&#39;s been <br/>
doing lately. LOVE IT. ;)<br/>
<br/>
I also have to tell you that hearing from you Sandra, after having <br/>
read a lot about unschooling on your page Radical Unschooling is a <br/>
bit surreal, almost like I am having conversations with John Holt or <br/>
something. (I am reading one of his books along with several others <br/>
about educating children right now... Depends on where I am in the <br/>
house as to which one I have my nose in, if you know what I mean... <br/>
LOL! I leave &#39;em all over the place and pick up the most handy one <br/>
when I am in whereever my kids are... Just been reading &#39;The Hurried <br/>
Child&#39; by David Elkind while my kids were bubble bathing &#39;cause it&#39;s <br/>
the one sitting in the bathroom.. ha! but I digress...) Anyway, very <br/>
cool to actually hear from you and that you are so involved in the <br/>
exchange of ideas on these boards! Thank you! :) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-243087594">My son&#39;s  speech  is often garbled and hard to understand.  He just turned 16.  He was adopted  as an infant, was a 27 week premie which might account for his inability to articulate certain sounds.      I didn&#39;t learn about unschooling til he was 9 or so; he was in school til then.  (Fortunately, we traveled alot and took school kind of lightly, but when he was in  school they gave him regular speech therapy) <br/>
<br/>
Since beginning unschooling I&#39;ve not sought out therapy or any circumstance to improve his speech; both because he hasn&#39;t asked and it didn&#39;t seem to help him when he was in it.    I  ask him to repeat things sometimes, or say I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t get that . . . I don&#39;t pretend that I understand him when I don&#39;t.   <br/>

Dan will talk about his speech impediment, (his words) as embarrassing and sometimes getting in his way.   He leans towards texting and email alot to communicate with friends (but so do my other kids).  I&#39;m noticing that he slows his speech down on the phone and with new people.  It seems to go in phases, too, there&#39;s weeks when he&#39;s  harder to understand and then weeks when he&#39;s pretty clear.   <br/>
<br/>
 He interviewed for a paid internship at a museum and had to answer questions publicly to all the other people (teens, curators, etc) in the program.  He began by talking about his difficulties with his speech.  He said it was his weakness and his strength.   Apparently it started a few other people in the group &quot;admitting&quot; to early speech therapy and being embarrassed about speech issues.   He was selected for the job, but decided after two weeks that  it wasn&#39;t what he wanted to do.  It could have been because he was going to have to tour people through the museum and talk to the public, but the overall shape and duties of the internship were unclear as well; he decided not to continue. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t  suggest things that he might &quot;do&quot; to improve his speech although I do think about it so I have ideas at the ready should he ask for help specifically ( coaching in diction; pre- broadcasting coaching,  mouth exercises, using straws, blow-pens, popsicles, push-ups,  learning tongue twisters,  to learning auctioneering . . .(!) )<br/>
<br/>
 It&#39;s been a tender balance - from a  matter of factness when I don&#39;t understand him, to  just being available to say, yeah, it sucks sometimes, to  having these ideas at the ready,  to most importantly  focusing on his strengths and interests. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1003103931">I am the original poster on the speech topic and I guess I should have mentioned that that we do NOT live in the US and are somewhat remotely located in Costa Rica.  Services like speech therapy are harder to come by here particularly to find a therapist with no English impediment of their own. (most native Spanish speakers have quite an accent in English)   I do believe it is a motor function thing and I also will have his hearing tested.  He had tubes as a baby and was tested after that but maybe scar tissue has built up.  When shown specifically how to say something he responds quite well and can repeat the word correctly but even after lots of doing this, when he is excited he speaks fast and forgets all of it:)  Thanks so much everyone and any other tidbits would eb greatly appreciated.<br/>

<br/>
And/or it could be that he is hearing a lot of heavily accented English. How <br/>
does he do when speaking in Spanish?<br/>
<br/>
Play tongue twister games together. Maybe write your own funny ones or <br/>
limericks as part of the games.<br/>
