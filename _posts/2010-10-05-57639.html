<div id="ygrps-yiv-1296181420">Dear friends,<br/>
<br/>
My son and I are visiting our family this week.  We had our first brief<br/>
visit with my parents yesterday.  When we were leaving, my dad asked me what<br/>
we were doing about our son&#39;s schooling while we were visiting.  He asked if<br/>
we had to &quot;catch up&quot; when we returned home.  I answered by saying that, for<br/>
us, this is another learning learning opportunity.  We don&#39;t stop and do<br/>
subjects.  We learn all the time from what is around us and what we find.<br/>
 My dad was not happy with this answer and asked &quot;but what about math and<br/>
reading.&quot;  Ethan has been reading for a few years.  He knows that.  I<br/>
answered that he reads all the time.  I said that math is all around us.  He<br/>
looked unhappy about that--angry even.  I said that Ethan enjoys<br/>
programming, and there is a lot of math in that.  He said &quot;okay then, well<br/>
he&#39;s gotta do something if he&#39;s going to be able to keep up.&quot;  Thankfully<br/>
our son had gone outside to run around on the grass by that time, and didn&#39;t<br/>
have to hear that comment.  My parents both looked at him and asked if he<br/>
could ever sit still.  I answered he did so happily when he was interested<br/>
in what he was doing.  He is only 7.<br/>
<br/>
I know this is not going to be the end of my parent&#39;s questions, and I am<br/>
dreading the questions from my husband&#39;s parents.  They are relentless.<br/>
 There really isn&#39;t anyone here that understands or really supports what we<br/>
are doing.  When my parents asked my son what he likes to do other than<br/>
computers, my son paused.  &quot;What do you mean?&quot; he asked.  He likes to do<br/>
pretty much everything he does.  We had just been talking about how much he<br/>
enjoys the piano, how we canned some applesauce from apples we picked, how<br/>
he just got a bike with gears and was excited about riding it and using the<br/>
gears.  It&#39;s kind of like they are not listening, and that must be confusing<br/>
for him.<br/>
<br/>
Anything anyone can offer soon would be great.  I am dreading this week.  I<br/>
am so grateful we live where we live and have the freedom to do what we do.<br/>
 Being a person who was raised to please everyone makes these transactions<br/>
even more difficult for me, but I do realize the importance of being strong<br/>
for my son.  Thanks in advance.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Those have links to other things, too.<br/>
<br/>
You could tell them that if they&#39;re willing to read about unschooling,  <br/>
you would be willing to discuss it with them after they&#39;ve read.  Find  <br/>
a book or a few articles, maybe, to &quot;assign.&quot;  If they start in about  <br/>
it again, you could say &quot;Did you read that book?&quot; and if yes, discuss  <br/>
the book.  If no, say something like  &quot;Why not?&quot; or  &quot;If you&#39;re not  <br/>
willing to read about it, I don&#39;t want to argue about it with you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Another good thing to say is &quot;This is working well for now.  If it  <br/>
stops working, we&#39;ll put him in school.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
If they think they *did*, tell them that they need to back off and trust that you know what you&#39;re doing. *You* and your husband are your child&#39;s parents, not them. They had their chance; now it&#39;s your turn. If they are happy with how you turned out, they need to trust you to do what *you* think is best for your child.<br/>
<br/>

If they think they did a *bad* job, then they DEFINITELY need to back waay off because you don&#39;t want to follow suit.<br/>

Your father seems like a genuinely caring parent/grandparent. That being said, is he familiar with unschooling? If not, you may want to send him some literature on it. If he is only aware of traditional forms of education, then he may always question what you are doing. One thing that may help too, is educating them about successful (in every sense of the word) adults that have been unschooled. It&#39;s great that they care; their questions about your son show that. : )<br/>

I read this on another list, and I started wondering... How would my mom answer? I believe her answer would be that SHE did a great job, but her ungrateful, willful, &quot;bad&quot; daughters screwed things up. (My two sisters and I have all had major... um... &quot;issues&quot; in our lives.) So, she doesn&#39;t trust the choices I make, and still believes she knows best.<br/>

(Following the Grateful Dead, not working full time when I had the chance, homebirth, extended breastfeeding, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
And, of course, now that the boys are older (17 and 11) and are sweet, smart, polite boys, there&#39;s not much anyone can say.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It may help your son to offer him some things to say in answer to that question. &quot;What do you like to do?&quot; is a kind of standard &quot;conversation starter&quot; that adults use with kids, so set your son up with some &quot;answers&quot; and have some in mind yourself so that if he&#39;s confused you can prompt or answer for him. <br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re thinking &quot;homeschool&quot; then piano and applesauce and learning about gears might be sounding &quot;educational&quot; - which means they don&#39;t expect him to like them beyond the way kids like subjects in school. Think of some &quot;fun&quot; things that don&#39;t sound educational for &quot;what do you like&quot; questions and use things like &quot;learning about gears&quot; to answer &quot;what about math/science&quot; questions (or making applesauce or playing piano for that matter!). <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-779044219">I also have tended to look beyond convention. I have 3 sisters who don&#39;t.<br/>
I&#39;ve gotten those words leveled at me (ungrateful, willful, bad, screwed<br/>
up). And to hear my parents, they did it right and I sabotaged it ... by<br/>
transferring out of a perfectly good college (I was a nontrad independent<br/>
older student whose parent&#39;s permission wasn&#39;t required), and getting out<br/>
from my parents&#39; direct influence for years. Decisions that I think were a<br/>
good idea. Then I married and had a baby in my 30s after that. My decision<br/>
to unschool has been questioned, but not very closely because of all the<br/>
foregoing history where I did my own thing for so many years without asking<br/>
their opinion or looking for their blessing at all.<br/>
<br/>
Not everybody has that history with their family. And actually my mother did<br/>
the same thing but for longer ... broke with her parent and siblings for 3<br/>
decades.<br/>
<br/>
I knew a handful who did the same thing I did (made their own decisions) but<br/>
it was different... they did so with their parents glad to see what their<br/>
kids did, and proud of them. I felt wistful to see it but at the same time<br/>
encouraged that in some parallel existence or in my imagination my parents<br/>
*could have* done that too.<br/>
<br/>
I like to imagine that they did sometimes, and that makes me feel a lot more<br/>
charitable when I go visit. I know logically what their choices are BUT I<br/>
have become good at pretending they like me the way I am (they DO like me as<br/>
well as their ideal), and just moving through rather than pressing for my<br/>
parents to like exactly who I am. That partial pretense gives me time to<br/>
relax with them and be myself while listening and feeling their wishes for<br/>
me that I don&#39;t agree with, which I let pass through me. Otherwise I might<br/>
not have calmed down and been able to visit at all. I&#39;ve only started<br/>
spending a little time with them in the last 5 or so years. It is finally ok<br/>
with me that we will likely never be close.<br/>
<br/>
The hardest part is the emotional reality that children like to move from a<br/>
secure connection with their parents into the new world of exploration, and<br/>
if parents could see how wonderful that is, they might feel confident about<br/>
their grown children making different parenting decisions rather than<br/>
rejected for the different ways of the generations that come later. In my<br/>
opinion, unschooling is an excellent way to experience newness on a daily<br/>
basis.<br/>
<br/>
I think people who haven&#39;t done that most of their lives will find that it&#39;s<br/>
a lot to learn, all of a sudden. And I would say that if *I* can, others who<br/>
want to can also, to whatever degree they wish.<br/>

Sometimes I have underestimated the ability of my own parents to understand<br/>
us and our ways of life!<br/>
<br/>
 Just try to explain matter of fact in the first encounter. Then do as<br/>
Sandra suggested.<br/>
<br/>
If it still does not work then just stop trying to convince them for a<br/>
while.<br/>
<br/>
My experience has been to work on my own confidence in unschooling so that<br/>
every time I was asked I knew exactly what to say and people just stopped<br/>
asking on their own.<br/>
<br/>
For example my mom in law has this nagging habit of attributing any small<br/>
disagreement I have with my husband to unschooling. she often tells me since<br/>
the kids are at home all the time, they leave me with less energy for my<br/>
husband.<br/>
<br/>
The other day she tells me &quot;do you know in America homeschooling began<br/>
because of sex and drugs in school.&quot; I simply have tonnes of research to<br/>
back my answer to such statements. Obviously her statement has come from a<br/>
friend who has been to America once or twice to visit their sons or<br/>
daughters living there.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen that when I am prepared with my research and knowledge on any<br/>
issue, I can also see through fluff and fear tactics.<br/>

No hostility at all. Simple. Matter-of-fact. No nonsense.<br/>
Basically, it boils down to trust. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Most new unschoolers can&#39;t describe what they&#39;re doing. But it doesn&#39;t matter. *Your* parents got to parent *you*. Now *you* get to be the parent.<br/>
It should be *just* that easy.<br/>

If it doesn&#39;t, it doesn&#39;t.<br/>
Some people&#39;s parents are hostile to the point of wanting to take  <br/>
their kids away from them, about unschooling.  There&#39;s a great range  <br/>
of reactions and there might be some U.S. realities (fundamentalist  <br/>
Christianity and local child welfare offices come to mind) that just  <br/>
don&#39;t apply in India.<br/>
<br/>
-=-The other day she tells me &quot;do you know in America homeschooling  <br/>
began because of sex and drugs in school.&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
MANY fundamentalist Christian homeschooling sites will say that.  And  <br/>
that they don&#39;t want their children exposed to &quot;multi-culturalism&quot; or  <br/>
to information about evolution.  There is also a myth among Christian  <br/>
homeschoolers that there was no homeschooling before the early 1980&#39;s  <br/>
when &quot;they started it&quot; but it&#39;s not true.  John Holt and Growing  <br/>
Without Schooling were secular and in full swing, in reaction to a  <br/>
fair number of hippies and other social radicals, mostly in the  <br/>
western U.S., with alternative/free/open-classroom schools and commune  <br/>
&quot;schools&quot; and just not sending their kids to school.<br/>
<br/>
Your mother is not wring about that sex and drugs charge, except for  <br/>
the &quot;it began&quot; part.  But the Christian Homeschooling movement with  <br/>
its vast financial investments in &quot;protection&quot; and re-written history  <br/>
and Bible-based &quot;science&quot; are there, and huge.<br/>
<br/>
For me, I think schools tell kids too little, not too much.<br/>
I think schools control kids too much, not too little.<br/>
<br/>
The opposite view is held by more homeschoolers than not.<br/>
<br/>
I keep reading offhand comments from people (unschoolers and liberals)  <br/>
scoffing at the suggestion that most homeschoolers are religious  <br/>
school-at-home families.  In the United States, they are.  Most.  By  <br/>
far.  Just because things have progressed to the point that someone  <br/>
can unschool or homeschool for years without ever encountering them  <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean they aren&#39;t still there.  Their conferences draw  <br/>
*THOUSANDS* of people.  Not a few hundred, like the big unschooling  <br/>
conferences do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-950996148">&quot;I also have tended to look beyond convention.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I have been very non-traditional not only in homeschooling but in our family life, and it has caused some rifts in my family that are still not mended. My DH was an at-home dad for twelve years with our youngest (and only homeschooled) child. We did some &quot;school at home&quot; stuff, but the majority of Micah&#39;s life has been all about unschooling. Not really radical unschooling until the past three years, but those three years have been amazing. He&#39;s almost 16 now, and I have never seen a teen like him. The only teens in our area are in public school, so that&#39;s a big divider in itself. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As to answering questions with family, it depended upon who was asking. I, too, had a terrible childhood. It has really dictated how I&#39;ve raised my own kids. My parents didn&#39;t understand the homeschooling part, and definitely wouldn&#39;t understand unschooling at all, so when they ask I usually just pick out a couple of things Micah&#39;s talked about or done recently. I don&#39;t get into philosophical discussions with my parents - we&#39;re too vastly different and I have some serious unresolved &quot;inner child&quot; issues to be able to have any kind of intelligent debate with them. <br/>
<br/>
My siblings have mixed reactions, and are usually content to tell me how great their kids are doing in school, and asking me what grades Micah&#39;s getting this year. It depends on the context as to how I respond to them. My sister thinks my husband is a total bum for staying home with our kids and &quot;mooching&quot; off me (her words - never mine) for so many years. I don&#39;t even attempt to explain things to her because she&#39;s already made up her mind. <br/>
<br/>
If family or friends are genuinely interested, I have a discussion with them and show them resources on unschooling and the whole philosophy behind it. I generally try to draw a comparison on how adults learn things (as they need to or want to) and how children learn (by experience, when they need to have a skill, etc). Most of the people whose opinions I care about get this concept. Those who don&#39;t generally back off when they see I&#39;ve gone off on a rant. I have a rant reputation...lol! <br/>
<br/>
I also blog about it and use my blog as a means of explanation. <br/>

<br/>
I would like to second, third and fourth this. Not only because I&#39;ve<br/>
found other unschooler blogs to be really inspiring, but also from a<br/>
sheer, strategic keyword perspective.<br/>
<br/>
See, when you type &quot;unschool&quot; or &quot;unschooling&quot; into a search, the<br/>
search engine results page (SERP) ranks things on all kinds of crazy<br/>
algorithms that change all the time, but the #1 that never has is<br/>
keyword usage. So if the search engine has a whole lot of sites with a<br/>
solid keyword density (that is, they talk about unschooling a lot),<br/>
then the SERP will be filled with really solid sites. As it is, there<br/>
are so few sites (compared to a lot of other things, including<br/>
unschooling detractors) that the SERP is kinda spotty. For instance,<br/>
the Wikipedia page on Unschooling comes up before Sandra&#39;s page, but<br/>
if I was trying to explain unschooling to doubting relatives, I sure<br/>
wouldn&#39;t want them seeing the wikipedia page first, y&#39;know? The ABC<br/>
News piece on unschooling comes up WAY before, say, Joyce&#39;s page.<br/>
<br/>
Tammy Takahashi, Ronnie Maier, and Frank Maier, some of my favorite<br/>
weekly (or daily) reads, don&#39;t even show up by the end of page 2. And<br/>
that is a complete shame, because I think that reading them presents a<br/>
really nice balance. The Life Without School collective blog, which is<br/>
live but not active, isn&#39;t even on page 3, and it contains the<br/>
hands-down best essay on why living right now today with your kids is<br/>
important I&#39;ve ever read (Missy&#39;s &quot;Chasing Bananas&quot;, if you want to<br/>
know.)<br/>
<br/>
Right now, the haters and doubters have the upper hand. They&#39;re<br/>
interleaved between the good results on the SERP, and that is NOT a<br/>
good way to convince search-engine questers.<br/>
<br/>
So yeah. If every person who loves and is inspired by unschooling<br/>
blogged about it, even once a week, and tagged their posts with<br/>
&quot;unschool, unschooling, homeschooling&quot; we&#39;d have a solid three pages<br/>
of SERP results before folks got to the bad stuff, and we&#39;d be a<br/>
sizeable presence on the &quot;homeschooling&quot; searches too.<br/>
<br/>
And in today&#39;s Google world, a *lot* of folks inform their opinions<br/>
based on what they find in the SERP. And what they find depends a lot<br/>
on what *we* put there.<br/>

Wikipedia is ahead of you and ahead of Joyce and ahead of a TON of<br/>
other superior references. And have you *looked* at the wikipedia<br/>
page? Not confidence-inspiring. The SERP is not based on where you&#39;ve<br/>
gone, it&#39;s based on a bunch of proprietary algorithms. In fact, Google<br/>
caused a stir in the Search Engine Optimization world a few weeks ago<br/>
by announcing that page load speed was going to be a factor, going<br/>
forward.<br/>
<br/>
The point is, most people never ever look past the first page, let<br/>
alone to the first three, which is how far back you have to go to find<br/>
what I know to be excellent sources. Those sources would pop up if the<br/>
keyword density increased in *other* sites, so as to crowd out the<br/>
really rotten sources.<br/>

the top, but I&#39;m linked on the wikipedia page.<br/>
According to the stats at my yahoo smallbusiness page, there are  <br/>
29,410 links to my site.  Not all to the unschooling page; the David  <br/>
Bowie letter has been linked a lot.  But mostly unschooling links from  <br/>

I was able to confirm that you are correct that browsing history matters. This Google page <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/corporate/tech.html">http://www.google.com/corporate/tech.html</a> says: &quot;we offer personalized search results based on your web history and location&quot;. They use more than 200 algorithms to rank results!<br/>
<br/>
While I wouldn&#39;t discourage people from adding keywords to their blogs, search engines are smart enough to detect keyword spamming, so don&#39;t overdo it. There&#39;s a lot more to page rank; adding quality links is important, too.<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;Teach Until They Get It<br/>
 <br/>
I love this idea - “Teach until they learn it.”<br/>
It’s so easy to get annoyed with our kids when they “just won’t learn.” But why? <br/>
Why is it so important that they learn on the first, second, third, or even <br/>
fourth attempt? Why do they have to learn it *now*? What’s the hurry?<br/>
Maybe we need those first fifteen exposures before we can figure it out.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
It is pretty clear her understanding of unschooling is so  not what we talk <br/>
about here. All you read there is teach , teach  , teach.<br/>
I had never heard of her at all until today.<br/>
I know there are many more unschooling advocates and writers that I don;t know.<br/>
No wonder people come here and say things that makes  us go  hmmm!<br/>

&gt; but for families with skeptical relatives to keep their OWN blogs with  <br/>
&gt; photos of their OWN children doing interesting things, with a running  <br/>
&gt; &quot;portfolio&quot; of activities and accomplishments, interesting questions  <br/>
&gt; and cute quotes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-716744452">&lt;&lt;&lt;He asked if we had to &quot;catch up&quot; when we returned home.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I might have answered &quot;yes&quot; to this question and detailed all of the things -- projects, activities, books you&#39;re reading, regular outings, etc -- that you will pick back up when you get home. It sounds like your family is seeing things in schoolish terms, which is not at all surprising if they haven&#39;t learned much about unschooling. Maybe some reassurance in terms that they undestand will diffuse their anger and worry, and lead to better conversations.  <br/>
