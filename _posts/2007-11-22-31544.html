<div id="ygrps-yiv-1243053777">Thought I&#39;d share this, as it&#39;s that time of year when we see more relatives <br/>
and others who tend to get into our business about homeschooling and parenting.<br/>
 <br/>
After a family funeral yesterday, I ended up sitting next a very <br/>
conservative-looking 70-something year old man who started asking about my kids, who were <br/>
sitting just across the table from us.  He asked how they were doing in school <br/>
(to which I replied &quot;great!&quot;) and then he went on to tell me how important <br/>
grades were, and how schools aren&#39;t as good as they used to be, and I figured it <br/>
wasn&#39;t worth it to get into it with the guy, so I just said, couldn&#39;t be more <br/>
pleased with them, they&#39;re doing great, and that seemed to satisfy him.<br/>
 <br/>
But then word gets back to him through someone else that they&#39;re <br/>
homeschooled.  So then he wants to know how their progress is measured (&quot;I talk to them&quot;) <br/>
and all that, and I ended up taking the conversation over to him.  He&#39;s <br/>
retired, and I asked him about what he&#39;s interested in and how he learns.  He ended <br/>
up telling me all kinds of things about himself, and expressing frustration <br/>
with certain things he&#39;s trying to learn and methods he&#39;s using, and comparing <br/>
his retirement years with his working years and his school years and how he&#39;s <br/>
using his brain less, or at least, differently, I pointed out.  He had concerns <br/>
that he wasn&#39;t writing as much as he used to and it bothered him that he was <br/>
losing that skill, and I ended up acting as sort of a couselor for him by <br/>
suggesting ways he could incorporate more writing into his daily life that might <br/>
be enjoyable to him.  He just lit up, he was so delighted with the opportunity <br/>
to talk about his interests and to find someone to listen to his thoughts.  <br/>
And it made him forget all about his concerns about my kids.  He told me, <br/>
&quot;You&#39;re a real progressive!&quot;  to which I responded, &quot;Thanks, I&#39;ll take that as a <br/>
compliment.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, it was cool, and got my kids off the hook too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1773300075">Awesome!  I find it ironic in some way because i&#39;m sitting here thinking how tonight i felt the need to explain, and justify our choices and our learning experiences to a concerned family member and she ended up talking about some of her experiences as a teacher in a college with studens from all kinds of places.  Basically the real star point that was clear was that we all can continue to grow  and learn throughout our lives and that it isn&#39;t as pat and dry as 12 yrs of this that and the other things in this order and there you go- off to college and collect your &quot;$200&quot;.<br/>
 I was hoping that by my pointing that out she would cease to keep pressuring me about my sons lack of reading skills at his age.  I can only hope she thinks it over more but in the mean-time i wonder if her judging us is your typical human behavior done so as to take the pressure off of ones own issues.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1123243187">&lt;&lt;I can only hope she thinks it over more but in the mean-time i  wonder if <br/>

off of ones own issues.&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I think there&#39;s something to that.  I wonder if it works the other way  <br/>
sometimes too, like we *think* people are judging us because we&#39;re judging  <br/>
ourselves, and maybe they&#39;re just interested or mildly concerned and we  interpret it <br/>
differently and become defensive because we&#39;re not so sure of  ourselves.<br/>
 <br/>
I do notice that people seem less critical of our decision to homeschool  the <br/>
kids now that the kids are a bit older, 11 and 12.  But the kids  haven&#39;t <br/>
really changed, they still don&#39;t like to talk to strangers  and distant relatives <br/>
much (and wow them with their amazing knowledge,) so  it&#39;s not like they&#39;re <br/>
&quot;proving&quot; anything other than getting taller.  So  perhaps part of it is our <br/>
perception.  <br/>
 <br/>
What&#39;s definitely changed is *me.*  I&#39;m not worried.  I see the  kids <br/>
learning and I love the relationship we have with them, and I just don&#39;t  really care <br/>
anymore about convincing anybody else.  I find that  I&#39;m arguing much less, <br/>
so maybe that&#39;s why they are too.  <br/>
 <br/>
So now what I&#39;ve been feeling is more of mild annoyance  that people can&#39;t <br/>
just talk about something else.  I wonder  if that&#39;s a bit like what it feels <br/>
like to be famous and have  people wanting your autograph all the time.  It&#39;s <br/>
always about  *that.*  So I guess what I&#39;m saying is that I&#39;ve finally <br/>
discovered it  doesn&#39;t have to be, and maybe some people are just looking for something <br/>
 interesting to talk about, or like you said, dealing with their own  issues. <br/>
 And without the stress of feeling a *need* to  convince people I know what <br/>
I&#39;m doing, I really don&#39;t mind so much.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-565014121">I can&#39;t even remember the last time I talked about homeschooling or  <br/>
unschooling with relatives or acquaintances. Used to be a topic of  <br/>
conversation on the sidelines of kids&#39; soccer games, but now that the  <br/>
kids are in high school, the number one topic pretty much is school- <br/>
kids&#39; parents nonstop complaining about the ridiculousness and  <br/>
stupidity and arbitrariness and downright meanness of school rules  <br/>
and regulations and officials and teachers. &quot;I&quot; get tired of hearing  <br/>
that stuff - they all think they&#39;re stuck with it and don&#39;t ever  <br/>
consider the possibility of just leaving the system. And they almost  <br/>
seem to get some pleasure out of feeling like they&#39;re all being  <br/>
persecuted. They are often VERY indignant on behalf of their kids -  <br/>
they talk about &quot;going in there and telling them what I think&quot; -  <br/>
stuff like that. The other big topic among sideline parents is  <br/>
complaining about their own kids - their &quot;attitude&quot; and how they have  <br/>
to keep restricting them and taking more and more things away from  <br/>
them to get them to, you guessed it, take school seriously.<br/>

So what do you do when they complain.  I find myself getting irritated at<br/>
these parents, and if they are strangers than I don&#39;t bother even getting<br/>
much more than irritated and talking to my dh, and possibly my kids about<br/>
it.  However, if it is family, sometimes I can&#39;t resist saying something.<br/>

Since we can&#39;t know what knowledge will be most needed in the future, it is<br/>
senseless to try to teach it in advance. Instead, we should try to turn out<br/>
people who love learning so much and learn so well that they will be able to<br/>
learn whatever needs to be learned<br/>

<br/>
Maybe you could simply say something like &quot;It seems the restrictions  <br/>
might be part of the problem,&quot; in a neutral, conversational way and  <br/>
smile and say &quot;Pass the dip&quot; or some such thing.  They&#39;ll either  <br/>
think about it later or not, but you wouldn&#39;t feel so much like you  <br/>
failed to act.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1682603701">I talk about how I admire &quot;gumption&quot; and &quot;spirit&quot; and &quot;independence&quot;  <br/>
in the kids much more than &quot;obedience.&quot; I smile and say nice things  <br/>
about how glad the parent should be that their kid is thinking for  <br/>
herself.  I usually kind of commiserate a little about how it  <br/>
sometimes seems it would be nice if our kids would jump when we say  <br/>
jump, but then I act like I assume they agree with me that we don&#39;t  <br/>
want our kids to be the types to be overly compliant, we want them to  <br/>
be comfortable not going along with the crowd, saying no, and, since  <br/>
these are all girls we&#39;re talking about, I might bring up dangers  <br/>
that too-obedient girls face - things like date rape. These are all  <br/>
16 to 18 year old girls - so this is something that is on the  <br/>
parents&#39; minds.<br/>
<br/>
I can tell that some of the parents really do change, at least for  <br/>
the moment, the way they are thinking about their child. They really  <br/>
look surprised and they kind of light up in a bewildered way.  It  <br/>
helps that I can honestly say I&#39;ve never punished, restricted,  <br/>
grounded, or taken anything away, nor anything else like that, and  <br/>
yet my kid is right there in front of them- well-behaved, sweet,  <br/>
popular, happy, and very clearly enjoying a super good relationship  <br/>
with her mom and dad. So - I have credibility and, in fact, sometimes  <br/>
they even directly ask me how I&#39;d handle a problem they&#39;re having  <br/>
with their daughter.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t impose my opinions a lot - to be clear - it isn&#39;t me standing  <br/>
there always interjecting my alternative point of view. I&#39;m careful  <br/>
about when I do it and to whom. I can kind of tell that there are  <br/>
people who aren&#39;t going to be open to it - and, generally, I try not  <br/>
to be near them either on the sidelines or during team parties or  <br/>
when we all go out to lunch, etc.<br/>

Holly wanted me to drive her to the dentist.  It was a short  <br/>
appointment and I stayed in the waiting room.  I moved away from a  <br/>
mom and son because she was ragging on him.  (He was 9 or ten, I  <br/>
think).   So I closed the interesting book I was reading and went and  <br/>
got a magazine and read that so I&#39;d have an excuse to go sit by the  <br/>
magazines, and wouldn&#39;t be simply standing up and moving.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Then a couple came in and were discussing a boy (maybe the bio child  <br/>
of one of them, or a nephew?) and the conversation was painful to  <br/>
hear, but there was nowhere else to sit. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
