<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We were just in Missoula yesterday, delivering my mother in law to the<br/>
&gt; airport.  It was hot, lot&#39;s of traffic, kinda smelly. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You went to the wrong part of Missoula!  The airport is the very worst part<br/>
of town, and I never went out that way except to go to the airport.  I lived<br/>
in the south hills area, completely on the other side of town.  We were<br/>
about 3 blocks above the smog line when it was so awful in town during the<br/>
inversions in winter.  I&#39;d look out the door in the morning and Missoula<br/>
would be completely gone.  It was so pretty that way....&lt;eg&gt;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Sorry you&#39;re missing Montana.  We&#39;ll remember you to Glacier park when we<br/>
&gt; get there.  I can send you a Missoulian or an Independent if you want.<br/>
&gt; Or, maybe a nice bottle of wine from Lolo Peak Winery?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Remember me to Two Medicine Camp store if you&#39;re out that way.  That&#39;s where<br/>
I worked, back in the days when employees (all 6 of us) lived on site rather<br/>
than drive in.  It was great.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;ll just come visit you and all my favorite haunts sometime!<br/>
