<div id="ygrps-yiv-860611750">&lt;&lt; And opinions: is it unreasonable of me to ask my husband to plan some trip <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;with the children some weekend and take them by himself for the sole purpose <br/>
&gt;of me getting sleep and cleaning the house? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Would the kids have fun?<br/>
