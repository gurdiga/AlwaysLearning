<div id="ygrps-yiv-1440792491">I have been reading a lot about teens, as my daughter, at 12, is coming into adolescence and cocooning a lot right now.&nbsp; I&#39;ve been reading unschooling resources online about teens, but I&#39;ve also been reading some non-unschooling stuff, gathering information. A really common suggestion on mainstream sites is, &quot;Boundaries allow teenagers to feel safe. Decide what the limits are and then stick to them.&quot;&nbsp; This caught my attention on this page in particular, because I think all the rest of the advice is pretty sound, despite a little bit of pejorative language (&quot;coping&quot; with your teenager&quot;)-- <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/family-health/Pages/coping-with-your-teenager.aspx">http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/family-health/Pages/coping-with-your-teenager.aspx</a><br><p>&nbsp; <br></p>This line about boundaries is common advice for mainstream parenting in general.&nbsp; I don&#39;t really know what it means.&nbsp; What does that mean, &quot;decide what the limits are&quot;?&nbsp; Does it mean, &quot;don&#39;t be wishy-washy&quot;?&nbsp; Does it mean, &quot;make arbitrary rules&quot;?&nbsp; I&#39;m wondering about this item because, even as unschoolers, I want to think about this and make sure I&#39;m not missing something.&nbsp;</div>

<br/>
-=-This line about boundaries is common advice for mainstream parenting in general.  I don&#39;t really know what it means.  What does that mean, &quot;decide what the limits are&quot;?  Does it mean, &quot;don&#39;t be wishy-washy&quot;?  Does it mean, &quot;make arbitrary rules&quot;?  I&#39;m wondering about this item because, even as unschoolers, I want to think about this and make sure I&#39;m not missing something. -=-<br/>

It&#39;s rare for me, after so many years, to see a new question, or an old question very nicely thought out and presented, so THANK YOU ubertulip.<br/>
<br/>
Because when we use other people&#39;s phrases it&#39;s easy to do it as a plug-in that we haven&#39;t fully examined—that doesn&#39;t have our own thoughts and knowledge behind it—the thing to do (I think) when you come to a phrase like &quot;teens need boundaries&quot; is to rephrase it.<br/>
<br/>
Are the boundaries to keep them in, or to keep dangers out?  Sometimes both.  Does it mean teens need security?  Probably.<br/>
<br/>
Does it mean teens need arbitrary rules?  Probably not, though many families see that as the way the parents exercise and display their &quot;power&quot; and authority.  The power to thwart.  The power to forbid.<br/>
<br/>
So for unschoolers, what DO parents have the power and authority to provide or to prevent?  That&#39;s where to look, I think.<br/>
<br/>
Principles.<br/>

This is only off topic insofar as &quot;teens need boundaries&quot; isn&#39;t in there.  But the problems remain.  It&#39;s the recitation of someone else&#39;s &quot;rule&quot; or put-down.<br/>
