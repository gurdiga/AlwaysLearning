<div id="ygrps-yiv-1782279560">Sandra (and anyone elses interpretation too) I am wondering if you <br/>
can explain your quote near the bottom of your strewing page <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sandradodd.com/strew/how">http://www.sandradodd.com/strew/how</a> near the bottom of the page <br/>
(sorry I don&#39;t know how to cut and paste!) for me.  You talk about <br/>
bringing things into the house if you feel there is not enough <br/>
exposure or if your kids could use something to become more well <br/>
rounded, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I have often wondered about this.  I find that I have grasped the <br/>
concept of &quot;em-biggening&quot; (another great term on your site, lol!) and <br/>
can follow what my kids are interested in and expand on that.  For <br/>
example, dd is interested very much in animals, somehow over the <br/>
years just letting it carry us where it will it has led to <br/>
maps/geography, planets, outer space, microorganisms, anatomy, etc.  <br/>
This is all coming up just by answering her questions, looking <br/>
something up, bringing something home, seeing something and thinking <br/>
they would find this neat,etc  <br/>
<br/>
What I am wondering about, in light of your quote, for me personally, <br/>
is in areas like math where I know my dd has a grasp of the meaning <br/>
of numbers, quantity, logical thinking etc but who I know would be <br/>
weak in the computational areas of math as I see it on my provinces <br/>
scope and sequence for grade one/two.  Soooo...do I consider <br/>
her &quot;less rounded&quot; and go buy Math U see (because dd is very hands <br/>
on/visual)like so many of my homeschooling friends do, or make sure <br/>
to fit Monopoly Jr. (which we have) in our day so that she can get <br/>
adding practice, because there is not enough of that &quot;type&quot; of math <br/>
in the house?  I feel anxious because one part of me feels like this <br/>
is so artificial and fake and forced to sit down with my &quot;Marshmallow <br/>
Math&quot; book to &quot;play a game&quot; with her to get math in on the sly...like <br/>
if I don&#39;t do &quot;this&quot; she won&#39;t get &quot;this&quot;, KWIM?  So, other than what <br/>
has naturally come up in real life, un-pre-planned and on the fly, <br/>
like showing her how pennies or dimes can make up a quarter, etc b/c <br/>
she asked one day when playing with her money collection, I have been <br/>
anxious about this issue and have left it alone....I have things like <br/>
the &quot;Family Math Book for Young Children&quot; but I can&#39;t bring myself to <br/>
do any of it with her....all of that stuff feels so out of context <br/>
with real life...why would she want to know if she had six <br/>
marshmallows and took 3 away what she would have left?  I see her <br/>
friends learning to add things like 23+6 and it scares me that what <br/>
if she is 15 and still has to count on her fingers? (OK, maybe not <br/>
that drastic!) It has to do alot with how I was taught math in the <br/>
70&#39;s...all the memorization of flash cards, addition facts, (so I <br/>
could INSTANTLY recall what 5+8 is and not use a calculator) without <br/>
really grasping what it meant<br/>
<br/>
In light of your quote Sandra, when does it become forced and a &quot;math <br/>
lesson&quot; or a &quot;reading lesson&quot; ?  Do I just try, and if it intrigues <br/>
her keep going, and drop it if it does not?  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your reply, I have been really wondering what you meant <br/>
by this quote, and would love some examples from your own family and <br/>
your thoughts on where things Do cross the line to manipulation. I <br/>
know deep down it comes to trusting that <br/>
she will get the math she needs in her real life when she needs it, <br/>
just like I see her now starting to read in leaps and bounds and <br/>
write because it is in situations it is meaningful to her, <br/>
but I am just finding that not comparing her to her peers instead <br/>
of her to herself and what she knows now compared to a few years ago <br/>
very difficult.<br/>

term (though I believe Sandra has conjugated it from the original <br/>
&quot;embiggens&quot;)?  Btw, I have not read the webpage being referenced, <br/>
although my house could certainly be described as &quot;strewn.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
I think that article on balance will help.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re looking at two extremes and ignoring the middle, I think.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;make sure to fit Monopoly Jr. in our day&quot; sounds pretty extreme.<br/>
<br/>
If someone has a math based game (we used to play Bazaar a lot;  <br/>
later, Five Crowns), if they play it because it&#39;s time for a math  <br/>
lesson that day, that&#39;s not good.  If they refuse to play it because  <br/>
it is math based, that&#39;s worse.<br/>
<br/>
Play it because it&#39;s fun.<br/>
<br/>
If a house has not a single map, globe or photo of a foreign place or  <br/>
of anything historical, that&#39;s quite a lack of opportunity for a  <br/>
child who could use some natural, everyday exposure to geography and  <br/>
history.  If the parents &quot;don&#39;t like&quot; geography or history, why might  <br/>
that be?<br/>
<br/>
If the parents just want their house to look hotel-room clean, they  <br/>
need to put their kids in school.<br/>
<br/>
If there is NO written word in the house, that&#39;s as bad as if parents  <br/>
force reading.<br/>
<br/>
Balance.<br/>
<br/>
-=- it scares me....  It has to do alot with how I was taught math in  <br/>

really grasping what it meant-=-<br/>
<br/>
And here you are all agitated and nervous and scared.<br/>
Breathe.  Let it go.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t put it on your child, and also don&#39;t avoid mathish input  <br/>
because of your own history.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Those aren&#39;t the only two questions, to do nothing or have a lesson.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Do you mean you&#39;re worried that your dd isn&#39;t doing what&#39;s listed on <br/>
the scope-and-sequence or that you aren&#39;t sure how to report what <br/>
she is learning to meet requirements? <br/>
<br/>
If you are just using the scope-n-sequence as a guide or checklist <br/>
then its important to know that those are created for the purpose of <br/>
teaching and don&#39;t really relate to how people learn organically. A <br/>
lot of that has to do with individual learning styles, but generally <br/>
speaking, people don&#39;t learn math in the sort-of sequential way its <br/>
usually taught. Here&#39;s a site you might find useful:<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to fit Monopoly Jr. (which we have) in our day so that she can get <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I bought some math manipulatives a few years ago. I wish I&#39;d spent <br/>
the money on more legos, instead. If your dd has lots of <br/>
opportunites to build, mix, pour, measure, sort, count, arrange, <br/>
predict and decide then she doesn&#39;t need specific toys or games. If <br/>
she wants to play Monopoly or Battleship or Dominoes, do it bc its <br/>
fun, not bc of the &quot;learning potential&quot; -especially if *you* have <br/>
issues about math. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; your thoughts on where things Do cross the line to manipulation.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Are you focusing on an outcome? That the &quot;line&quot; from my perspective. <br/>
If you are doing something with your kid bc its fun and you enjoy <br/>
each others&#39; company - great. When you impose expectations that the <br/>
child is going to learn something, you close yourself off to having <br/>
a genuine interaction. You also narrow your own perception to the <br/>
point that you miss a great deal of what your child is really <br/>
experiencing and learning. For example, if you are making cookies <br/>
and *you* are thinking &quot;aha! she&#39;s learning about meansurement!&quot; you <br/>
might miss or disregard the way she explores the texture of the <br/>
dough. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Would that be a tragedy? I have a friend who is a CPA who counts on <br/>
her fingers. Anything bigger, she uses a calculator. She almost <br/>
never tries to figure in her head - certainly not when she&#39;s working.<br/>
