<div id="ygrps-yiv-1555015">-=-    Like other speakers at the two-day conference at McLean Bible Church&#39;s <br/>
conference center, Mr. Smith emphasized Christian faith. &quot;We&#39;ve decided to <br/>
train them for heaven, not for Harvard,&quot; he said. -=-<br/>

<br/>
The rest of the article was better.<br/>
<br/>
This is the kind of summary statement that used to make me grouchy and now <br/>
just makes me sad.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m &quot;training&quot; my kids for anything, it&#39;s not heaven or Harvard.  <br/>
It&#39;s just being wholly THEM, peaceful and confident.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Children home-schooled by devout parents academically outperform their <br/>
public school peers and reveal better character development, according to <br/>
home-education leaders who gathered during the weekend. <br/>
    &quot;The battle for our children&#39;s souls is a war,&quot; Shelly Hendry of His <br/>
Image Ministries in Clarksville, Va., said at the Northern Virginia Home Education <br/>
Conference near Tysons Corner. &quot;We&#39;re like those firefighters [on September <br/>
11] who walked into those flames to do a rescue.&quot;     <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know that the rest of the article WAS much better. It makes it sound <br/>
as if Christians are the only people who homeschool, or that the only reason <br/>
for homeschooling is religion. And while I take my faith seriously, I do not <br/>
make it such that I can&#39;t laugh at myself or my ideas. <br/>
<br/>
AND... I do not think of my children or raising my children as a battle <br/>
ground where I have to go and rescue them. The comparison of parents to <br/>
firefighters, reaching through flames to rescue souls is horrid and asinine, IMO. As for <br/>
training my kids, I do not look at it that way. I see my kids strengths and <br/>
weaknesses, I see their joys and fears and I give them the tools they need and <br/>
want at that moment. I show them God, I show them nature, I show them good <br/>
people who think clearly and are articulate and thoughtful. If they want to go to <br/>
Harvard or to Theology school, if they become stay-at-home parents, doctors, <br/>
or burger-flippers then so be it. That is their decision, not mine. I want them <br/>
to feel loved, and to grow up happy and content. They are kids, their souls <br/>
are fine and certainly not burning in flames. If they are at risk for anything <br/>
it is being loved too much, and I do not believe that is possible. <br/>

acronym... it reminded me of Hermione&#39;s SPEW.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, when we were involved with the Alameda-Oakland Home Learners<br/>
group, I always saw AOHL as a**hole, so perhaps it&#39;s just my weird<br/>
brain... and Shyrley&#39;s!<br/>

sound <br/>
<br/>
as if Christians are the only people who homeschool, or that the only reason <br/>
<br/>
for homeschooling is religion. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s how they ALWAYS write. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Their reality of homeschooling is either unaware of &quot;secular homeschoolers,&quot; <br/>
or else they acknowledge them as some sort of come-lately parasites on the <br/>
Christian homeschooling movement.   But still, as exposure to homeschooling, for <br/>
people who read one article, it&#39;s not usually so off-putting/alarming as that <br/>
last part was.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
AND... I do not think of my children or raising my children as a battle <br/>
<br/>
ground where I have to go and rescue them. The comparison of parents to <br/>
<br/>
firefighters, reaching through flames to rescue souls is horrid and asinine, <br/>
IMO.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not for Baptists.  And the flames they&#39;re rescuing them from are Satan&#39;s <br/>
flames of hell.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the same crowd that fears Harry Potter and Hallowe&#39;en, The Simpsons <br/>
and rock&#39;n&#39;roll.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;As for <br/>
<br/>
training my kids, I do not look at it that way. I see my kids strengths and <br/>
<br/>
weaknesses, I see their joys and fears and I give them the tools they need <br/>
and <br/>
<br/>
want at that moment. I show them God, I show them nature, I show them good <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
are fine and certainly not burning in flames. If they are at risk for <br/>
anything <br/>
<br/>
it is being loved too much, and I do not believe that is possible. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
None of that would make (as they say) &quot;a lick o&#39;sense&quot; to a good Baptist.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Clearly and articulately&quot;?  Unless &quot;clearly&quot; involves unquestioning belief <br/>
the the Bible is the inerrant word of God, it&#39;s false clarity provided by the <br/>
Devil.   &quot;Articulately&quot; is something God either provides as a gift to be used <br/>
to save souls, or it&#39;s evil articulation from the devil.<br/>
<br/>
They would say you&#39;re an unfit mother because you don&#39;t care about your <br/>
children&#39;s eternal souls.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not exaggerating the beliefs of a TON of people.  God-fearing people.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not enough to stop homeschooling about, but I&#39;ve been saying for years <br/>
that all homeschoolers should know about it, because that&#39;s what that tar is we <br/>
keep being brushed with when we&#39;re not looking.<br/>
