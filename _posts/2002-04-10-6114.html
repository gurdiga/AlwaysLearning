<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Pretty good experience.  Not great.  Her least favorite of them all.<br/>
They had to be there for over 5 hours and were stuffed in a back room <br/>
for most of it.  They only did the munchkin scene, then came out for <br/>
curtain call. The show lasted over 2 1/2 hours.<br/>
They put in an extra show (2 in one day)the 2nd weekend because it <br/>
was doing so well, and they had to be there from 1:00pm to 11:pm that <br/>
day, mostly in the back room.  <br/>
Though in the end, she was glad she had been a part of it.<br/>
My son too.  They made some new friends and felt proud of the <br/>
production.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think I would rather my daughter be in a bad play that the kids <br/>
were really a part of.  Respected.  A bad play, where she had a good <br/>
time.  Way more than a good play/successful play, and not enjoy it so <br/>
much.  She&#39;s done both.  <br/>

&gt; If it doesn&#39;t matter to the kids, then it doesn&#39;t matter.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it matters to kids to be around petty, moody, self centered <br/>
adults.  It might not matter enough for them not to want to be a <br/>
part, but it does matter.  My experience with this show has been, <br/>
when you add the adults, it&#39;s not all about the children anymore.  <br/>
The other shows were more about the kids.  <br/>

the gossip.  <br/>

I agree.  But if I did find out &quot;unsavory&quot; things about people my <br/>
children were associating with, taking lessons from...I would put my <br/>
guard up.  I guess that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing now.<br/>
Thanks for the thoughts.<br/>
