<div id="ygrps-yiv-1159322185"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; <br/>
&gt; Connie - besides NYU and UCLA, can you share which other schools he<br/>
&gt; auditioned at. My dd is heading that way and we&#39;re starting to do a bit of<br/>
&gt; research. Also, did I read correctly that he was a transfer student and not<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>***Yes, he went in as a graduate (finished last Dec) from Clarion University <br/>
in PA.  He started college here in San Diego at community college.  When he <br/>
got a summer diving job in Houston he stayed on there to work, and finished his <br/>
lower division at a community college there, to then transfer to Clarion <br/>
because of the diving program (he went on to become the Nat. Champion on both the 1 <br/>
and 3 meter boards for them both years he was there).  He applied to U of <br/>
Irvine, and UCSD out here, then NYU, then UCLA and USD.  He said he would only <br/>
not take the UCLA offer if he were to get into the USC program.  For that one <br/>
you work one year here in San Diego with the Old Globe Theatre, and then go to <br/>
London for the second year, to work with a Shakespearean company.  Only about <br/>
three people get accepted to that program.  He doesn&#39;t think it will be him!  <br/>
<br/>
Actually, he had pretty much decided because of such limited numbers being <br/>
accepted, he had a whole back-up plan to go to Hollywood and try to find work - <br/>
to try that for a year, and if that didn&#39;t work out, then apply to &quot;lesser&quot; <br/>
known schools for their grad programs.<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say he is flying high after getting accepted.<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to mention he didn&#39;t start college until he turned 21 - when he <br/>
could continue to get health insurance IF he was a full-time student, and going <br/>
to school was cheaper than health insurance!!<br/>
