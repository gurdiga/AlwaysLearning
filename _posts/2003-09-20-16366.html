<div id="ygrps-yiv-1474939095">Hi Lynda,<br/>
<br/>
I have a dd much like your son and she has been out of school about 6 years<br/>
now.  What finally made the difference for her was finding her passion.  She<br/>
loves gymnastics and is definitely NOT built for it.  She is way, way too<br/>
tall and leggy to make all that flipping around easy, but still she loves<br/>
it.  She goes to meets knowing that she won&#39;t win, she takes extra classes<br/>
so that she doesn&#39;t fall behind her friends who are more gifted in that<br/>
area.<br/>
<br/>
Between stopping school and becoming self-motivated, she had models of her<br/>
Dad and I who have lots of interests and sometimes they come easy and<br/>
sometimes they don&#39;t.  She saw us making decisions and prioritizing what we<br/>
wanted to invest our time and selves into.<br/>
