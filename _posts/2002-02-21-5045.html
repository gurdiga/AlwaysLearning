<div id="ygrps-yiv-584522828">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m certain I did not ask my question with enough detail. Let&#39;s see. My kids <br/>
do want to do the craft I have started for myself. For little guy 5 it was <br/>
gluing sticks onto cans later to be painted. He hated the glue feeling, <br/>
hated the idea that I could put them on after he painted the sticks. Hated <br/>
that his fingers are small. Every thing I said made his screaming louder. He <br/>
did want to do the activity. He set a barrier of not liking to get his hands <br/>
sticky, so he really could not do the activity. I tried stating how <br/>
frustrating it must be. How dissapointeed he was for not being able to do it <br/>
the way he wanted to. I showed him I was sticky. We talked about washing his <br/>
hands after. His older sister was finding the craft very satisfying and <br/>
maybe this plays into it. He is feeling inferior. He did sob a ton about <br/>
wanting to be bigger. He screamed, flipped onto the floor, threatened to <br/>
turn the table over and then sobbed in his room. Nothing comforted him. He <br/>
is showing perfectionist attributes and maybe this is it. I am not ever <br/>
perfect, so it is hard for me to relate. I&#39;m asking for coping skills when <br/>
the kids flood due to frustrations. My oldest, 7 has a similar tendancy. We <br/>
were weaving paper hearts. She wanted to make one. I showed her. She will <br/>
barely look at what I am doing, expect to be able to do it easily, then <br/>
crumble to tears without really giving herself a fair shot at the project. <br/>
These are the types of real challenges. So when children scream before they <br/>
have tried a little bit what can you do to help them calm and then try again <br/>
hopefully.<br/>
<br/>
The pj&#39;s and the getting their own dishes, are issues I know are generated <br/>
from &quot;mom I need something from you so help me do these things&quot;. I have 3 <br/>
kids, all very close in age. Baby is 2 and usually gets her needs met first. <br/>
A very tired cranky hubby in the pm. Helping to put pj&#39;s on is real help for <br/>
the family. Jumping up and down on the bed screaming I can&#39;t is wearing out <br/>
our tired nerves. Riley does know how to open a drawer. He can dress <br/>
himself. Riley wants to be in control of the situation. I do find I <br/>
generally help my little guy. I like to do the jammies together. Hubby on <br/>
the other hand feels if he can do it he should do it. So, when kids are <br/>
capable of a skill but refuse to do it for some reason, what have others <br/>
done to help show the children they can do it and it feels good to be <br/>
capable. Am I more clear now?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe my kids tend to flood way more than others so I&#39;m stuck in trying to <br/>
surround them with skills to help them cope. Mine fight with each other. Do <br/>
not want to help me with any mundane chore, create messes on top of messes, <br/>
very intricate detailed messes with lots of mixed lego parts and train sets <br/>
and contraptions. They scream when they get frustrated. The yell not to help <br/>
them  then rip their project up and stomp out of the room. When we have lots <br/>
of these types of experiences I wonder are we really thriving at home. This <br/>
is the hard part for me at home. How can they be so frustrated so much of <br/>
the time. We give them so much freedom and they throw us a ton of garbage <br/>
back it seems. Any way. I&#39;m tired, thought I would try to generate more <br/>
solutions for a chronic problem that gets in our way of an enriching life.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-988053676">I just have a few thoughts to help *you* problem solve.<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible that your children think you *value* being good at <br/>
things?  They need to feel you value their uniqueness and how special <br/>
they are.<br/>
<br/>
You did mention that your daughter was in a performing program - I <br/>
think singing.  I&#39;m sure she gets a lot of attention for how good she <br/>
is.  This can cause some problems in the family because your children <br/>
are so young and haven&#39;t had time to feel good about just being who <br/>
they are.  They may see how much you value your daughters performing <br/>
and be trying to get the same attention but fall short and feel <br/>
frustrated.<br/>
<br/>
You said you sing her routine because you enjoy it.  Is there <br/>
anything your other children do that you could give as much attention <br/>
to. <br/>
<br/>
The other thought is to stop taking the initiative with your <br/>
daughters practice.  She is very young.  What if she just did it when <br/>
she felt like it - on her own?  Sure she may not be as good but does <br/>
that really matter?  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;He is showing perfectionist attributes and maybe this is it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I read somewhere that perfectionism is a learned trait.  Of course <br/>
this source could be way off but it is worth thinking about where <br/>
these tendencies are being picked up.  Is your dh a perfectionist?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; A very tired cranky hubby in the pm.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a difficult situation.  Sometimes I feel I have to soften the <br/>
blow for my kids when dh yells at them.  He will never tell them how <br/>
he is feeling about something they are doing and ask for some input <br/>
from them.  He just expects them to *behave* - whatever that means.<br/>
It certainly does not help children feel like love is unconditional <br/>
or that they are respected.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;So, when kids are capable of a skill but refuse to do it for some <br/>
&gt;reason, what have others done to help show the children they can do <br/>
&gt;it and it feels good to be capable.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Help the kids get dressed or any other life skill for as long as they <br/>
want.  Do it with them, not for them.  Take them by the hand and say, <br/>
let&#39;s go get your pj&#39;s out of the drawer.  Do you want to put the top <br/>
or bottom on first.  OK here&#39;s the bottom.  Maybe they will put on <br/>
the bottoms by themselves, then hand them the top.  Don&#39;t say - see I <br/>
knew you could do it.  Don&#39;t say - you&#39;re such a big boy for putting <br/>
on your pj&#39;s.  Give him a hug and say - great, now do you want me to <br/>
read you a story or whatever.  This is an easy way to give them <br/>
attention and they don&#39;t need to master getting dressed to feel <br/>
capable. They will feel capable when they master the things they feel <br/>
are important - you don&#39;t know what those things are yet. <br/>
<br/>
After you do this for a while, occasionally you could say you were <br/>
really busy and how about they get dressed themselves, it would <br/>
really help mommy out.  This could make them feel good.<br/>
<br/>
It really sounds like your kids are competing with each other for <br/>
your praise and attention.  <br/>
<br/>
A day or so after my daughters had a fight which ended in one of them <br/>
being punished(this was back in the days of our using punishments to <br/>
control our kids) the fighting was escalating.  I asked them what was <br/>
going on and Virginia (8 at the time) was able to tell me that when I <br/>
punished her a few days ago, it made her feel like I loved Allison <br/>
more and that was what was causing the fighting.  That was a real eye <br/>
opener.<br/>
<br/>
Now a days the only time my kids fight is when they need help finding <br/>
a solution to their differences.  <br/>
<br/>
I think the book by T. Berry Brazelton &quot;The Irreducible Needs of <br/>
Children&quot; would be a good one for you to read.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps a little.<br/>

&lt;&lt; So, when kids are capable of a skill but refuse to do it for some reason, <br/>
what have others done to help show the children they can do it and it feels <br/>
good to be <br/>
capable. Am I more clear now?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know no way of saying &quot;you can do it&quot; to a child who wants me to help (or <br/>
do it) without it being at the same time &quot;I am not going to help you.&quot;  If <br/>
kids are needy, they&#39;re needy.  Resisting makes them more needy.<br/>
<br/>
I hated anything weird on my hands (mud, paint, glue) when I was little, so I <br/>
can relate to that feeling.   Maybe (and of course any of these things could <br/>
be missing the mark) he wants to be with you and do something with you but <br/>
NOT what you&#39;re doing.  Maybe that&#39;s a craft to do when he&#39;s asleep, gone, or <br/>
older.<br/>
<br/>
Holly was a screamer, and has a painfully high-pitched voice.  She didn&#39;t get <br/>
the same leeway she would have gotten if she was talking when she was making <br/>
a noise that made people&#39;s entire nervous systems go on the painful alert.  <br/>
I&#39;ve taken her out of rooms and told her she could NOT scream like that, but <br/>
needed to talk, and left her where she was  until I could physically recover. <br/>
<br/>
Against tradition, which says children should NOT have their way, and they <br/>
need to learn to take no for an answer, I found that she was never &quot;screaming <br/>
for nothing.&quot;  And the incidents were worst when she was being ignored or <br/>
told to wait, wait, later...<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that the more kids are catered to, the less catering they need <br/>
as they get older.  I remember thinking my friend Chris was spoiled (meaning <br/>
ruined for life, in my thinking) because when he was a teen and in college <br/>
his mom still did his laundry totally, and put it in his drawer, and made his <br/>
bed.  But I was probably just jealous.  And at the same time he never ever <br/>
missed a social obligation involving his family, and he would lovingly wash <br/>
and wax his mom&#39;s car.  He didn&#39;t leave home until he was over 21.  But he <br/>
still loves his mom sweetly, and he took GREAT care of his own apartment (now <br/>
house), better than I ever have or will.    I was wrong.<br/>
<br/>
And I know more families where the parents pressed their children to be <br/>
independent, not to be needy, and those kids are my age and still needy.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s nothing in my personal experience or observation to support pressing <br/>
kids to get their own spoon and bowl if they really want help.<br/>
<br/>
One day Marty told me that the food tasted better when I got it for him.  He <br/>
was twelve, I think.  He can and usually does get his own food, but that day <br/>
he wanted me to make him something.  And as there was love instead of hurt or <br/>
resentment, it probably DID taste better.<br/>

I know my two kids are not a scientific example, but my experience of them <br/>
makes it hard for me to think that statement is true. Zoe will try anything, <br/>
loves most things, and will keep on doing them no matter how good she is. <br/>
Quinn is reluctant to do anything new, hates it if he&#39;s not good right away, <br/>
and then won&#39;t do it again until he can be. Guess which one is the later <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-251670983">.So when children scream before they<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;have tried a little bit what can you do to help them calm and then try again<br/>
&gt;hopefully.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Crafts=expected result=frustration city. Often. Just as you described.<br/>
Freeform art  and crafts work better around here, and only if they want to<br/>
do it. They initiate it, or they may join in if I&#39;m doing something. If I<br/>
want to do something I need to concentrate on or I think will be a problem<br/>
for them (based on past experience) I wait and do it when they&#39;re asleep.<br/>
<br/>
Sewing may just mean using a needle and thread to make a giant globby ball<br/>
of fabric. Crafting with popsicle sticks may mean gluing them into a solid<br/>
mass. That makes kids happy at a certain time. Happy is important. &quot;<br/>
Completing something&quot; only happens if it&#39;s important to them. There may be<br/>
gaps of weeks or months between attempts. This stuff is work for them, not<br/>
just doing something for relaxation like it often is for adults. One of my<br/>
kids has done maybe 2 craft projects in his life, his choice. He is not<br/>
unfulfilled. He now draws, builds models, takes things apart, makes<br/>
inventions. These things are work to him. He gets frustrated, he abandons<br/>
projects, he completes projects.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, if you are talking weaving paper hearts from 2 pieces of paper (the<br/>
Danish heart thingies), I was showing adults how to do that in December. I<br/>
had to put my hands on theirs to guide them in some cases, they were having<br/>
so much trouble. Just because something is a &quot;craft&quot; does not mean it is<br/>
easy!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, when kids are<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;capable of a skill but refuse to do it for some reason, what have others<br/>
&gt;done to help show the children they can do it and it feels good to be<br/>
&gt;capable. Am I more clear now?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t, because they aren&#39;t capable until they are all the way ready to do<br/>
something. Even if they are, why not do something to help them if they ask?<br/>
Would you do it for a friend? What are they really asking for?<br/>
<br/>
I try to go around the problem if it&#39;s getting me down. I am a morning<br/>
person and I am usually  alone with kids in evening because of hubby&#39;s<br/>
schedule so I&#39;m wiped out at night. I used to prep for evening early if I<br/>
could, like laying the clothes out ahead of time, when everyone is not so<br/>
tired. Or sleep in the day&#39;s clothes and do baths in am. Often I would<br/>
dress them in long johns with jumper/pants over during the day, then they<br/>
were already ready for bed!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do<br/>
&gt;not want to help me with any mundane chore, create messes on top of messes,<br/>
&gt;very intricate detailed messes with lots of mixed lego parts and train sets<br/>
&gt;and contraptions.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mundane chores may seem mundane to them if they are to you. Kids pick up on<br/>
your mindset. Working together and being invited to do the fun stuff, like<br/>
actually cooking, makes a difference around here. If toys are all mixed up,<br/>
can you just put them away in a jumble in a box until you all have the<br/>
energy to sort? Housework doesn&#39;t have to be perfect, just neat enough and<br/>
out of sight so you don&#39;t feel unbalanced.<br/>
<br/>
If you look at these things and search for ways to change your expectations<br/>
and reduce *your* stress, you may find some of the kids&#39;<br/>
frustrations/angers easing.<br/>

doing it just for the time with you.  Maybe you and your son could approach <br/>
it as a craft that you&#39;re making together.  He can do the parts he likes <br/>
and you can do the parts he doesn&#39;t like.  You aren&#39;t *helping* him do <br/>
*his* craft.  You&#39;re doing a craft together.  Does that make sense?<br/>

noticing the parts you think she might find hard *at first*?  Or maybe you <br/>
could just remember having had a lot of trouble doing this part or that <br/>
part as you&#39;re showing her how?  The idea is to help her see that most <br/>

they get frustrated and start screaming, you&#39;re going to have to help them <br/>
to not get frustrated in the first place.  Don&#39;t know if any of my <br/>
suggestions will help with your kids.<br/>

yourself really enjoy doing? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m finding that right now, at just-turned-nine, Cacie is just starting<br/>
to be able to do more &quot;follow the directions&quot; types of projects and enjoy<br/>
them. Sometimes. At 7 it would have been a struggle, and it was the few<br/>
times it came up. What helped is that she felt okay about handing it to<br/>
me and asking me to do a part. She still does that sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
At 5, I can&#39;t even imagine trying anything with formal directions. Five<br/>
is a nice age for &quot;Here are some pipe cleaners, some sequins, some foam<br/>
pieces, some paper, some markers&quot; and neat things often happen. Actually,<br/>
nine is good for that, too ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Help is a touchy issue sometimes. Asking for help can feel like admitting<br/>
that you&#39;re not good enough, that you failed. It sounds like you want<br/>
your children to ask for and accept more help with craft projects, but<br/>
ask for less help with routine activities like dressing. Maybe they feel<br/>
safer asking for help on something they know they really are competent at<br/>
doing, just to make sure it&#39;s there.<br/>

&gt;When I was a kid in school and we did a craft with elmer&#39;s glue, I used to<br/>
&gt;have the greatest fun covering my entire hand (palm side) with a layer of<br/>
&gt;glue. Then I continued to hold my hand open and blow on it to help the glue<br/>
&gt;dry. In a short while, the glue would be sufficiently dry and then I got the<br/>
&gt;greatest pleasure from peeling it off my hand. I thought it was neat that I<br/>
&gt;had a hand-print complete with all the lines and markings of my hands. Come<br/>
&gt;to think of it, I haven&#39;t done this since I was in about 6th or 7th grade.<br/>
&gt;Maybe I&#39;ll do it now and show it to my kids....<br/>

little bit cool but still liquid.<br/>

I used to do it with wax, too. &lt;g&gt;  I also love sticking my finger in warm wax and letting it harden and then taking the wax coccoon off my finger.<br/>

odd beads old jewelery, yarn, macaroni, beans, paper<br/>

things with tweezers.  A child who doesn&#39;t like finger<br/>

Water colors with a brush. Then put an overlay of<br/>
black construction paper with a cutout (you know,<br/>
slow-flake, hearts, a big hole) over it. No way to do<br/>
it wrong....it always looks good. Nice and clean and<br/>
removed.  Put it is an envelope and mail to to<br/>
someone. Everyone loves to get this sort of thing in<br/>
the mail. Well, except for Sandra&#39;s MIL. Don&#39;t mail it<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-34090935">My son is also disgusted by glue on his hands.  We have been doing collages<br/>
for almost a year now, similar to what you talk about Sharon.  I squirt glue<br/>
all over some wooden alphabet collage forms (got cheap at an educational<br/>
store), spread it out, and then plunk down tons of art stuff in little cups.<br/>
He does whatever he wants with it.   We&#39;ll have the whole alphabet done to<br/>
display soon.<br/>

It&#39;s okay if the crayfish isn&#39;t dried.<br/>
<br/>
(I read quickly and had to go back on that part:  &quot; One even had a<br/>
dried crayfish on it. That one was for Daddy. It<br/>
didn&#39;t survive...&quot;   I had to go back to find &quot;dried&quot;--I thought he crayfish <br/>
didn&#39;t survive being imbedded in glue!)<br/>

I guess it would probably be too awful for her to receive a sampling of <br/>
unschooling art from around the world...  darn it.<br/>
