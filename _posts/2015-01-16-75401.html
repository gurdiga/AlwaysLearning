<div id="ygrps-yiv-10053489"><p><span style="font-family:Helvetica;line-height:normal;">Words from here helped me this morning. It didn’t start very well - I woke up achey (am 6 months pregnant), the other 4 children were all in the bedroom with me kind of jostling for space. The 2 year old had spilled a jar of hama beads on the floor, the 9 year old was getting frustrated at a computer game. As sometimes happens when I’m not feeling my best, I start silently worrying that the deschooling we’ve been doing since October (although I’ve been reading for a lot longer than that) is to blame for the unsettled atmosphere - later nights making the children “crabby”, less restrictions on devices making them “anti-social”, lack of imposed structure (we used to have circle time, table time, quiet time, free time!) making my days difficult.&nbsp;</span></p><div style="font-family:Helvetica;line-height:normal;"><br></div><div style="font-family:Helvetica;line-height:normal;">I went downstairs to have a bowl of cereal and microwave my cup of coffee. After taking a moment I came back upstairs to help my son with the computer. When he saw that I couldn’t do the bit of the level the way he way trying either, he tried something else that worked. And I also found that my 5 year old had made my bed, and then went on to make hers and her sister’s! I have never asked her to do this, she just finds a “neatened” bed a very pleasing thing. It was such a lovely surprise, and it made me think - this is not a bad day, or even a bad morning. This was a bad MOMENT, and the next one can be better if I approach it in a more positive way. I ended up ignoring the voice in my head saying we “should” be dressed, we should have all had a good breakfast, I should clear up the mess. Instead I sat in the middle of it and played with wooden blocks with the baby. I read a chapter of a book to my son while he played on Minecraft. I helped my daughters tidy their bedroom (they don’t do it, but they love it when I do!). &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family:Helvetica;line-height:normal;"><div><br></div><div>I feel like remembering about moments rescued our day. I am very grateful for everything written here. Thank you.</div><div><br></div><div>Clare</div></div><p><span><br class="ygrps-yiv-10053489yui-cursor"></span></p></div>
