<div id="ygrps-yiv-492779654">Kirby cares about this, so I&#39;m passing it on.  I haven&#39;t looked at the site, <br/>
so beware!  (It might be wholly innocuous, but Kirby has procured from <br/>
somewhere a list of pirate pick-up lines which he intends to use freely at the Anime <br/>
convention he&#39;s attending this weekend, where he&#39;s going as Black Mage, <br/>
dressed as a pirate.  (Black Mage dressed as a pirate.)  He&#39;ll de-piratize after a <br/>
day or two, he says.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We would like to remind you of this upcoming event.<br/>

Oh, wait... tomorrow my peg leg will be full of termites.  Today, just<br/>
the same old knothole and splinters. <br/>
