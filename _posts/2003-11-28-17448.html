&gt; This week in the HSI e-Alert<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; **************************************************************<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; THIS WEEK IN THE HSI FORUM<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A thread on the HSI Forum this week just might help keep you<br/>
&gt; from coming down with a very unusual type of &quot;flu.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But this isn&#39;t your father&#39;s influenza; this flu is the<br/>
&gt; body&#39;s response to a familiar synthetic chemical, and it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; dubbed the &quot;Teflon flu.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In a tread titled &quot;Warning - Teflon Cookware,&quot; an HSI member<br/>
&gt; named Roz starts off by describing a recent edition of ABC&#39;s<br/>
&gt; 20/20 that included a disturbing report about the possible<br/>
&gt; environmental dangers posed by the production and widespread<br/>
&gt; use of Teflon and other products (such as some stain-<br/>
&gt; resistant carpeting) that are made with DuPont&#39;s Teflon<br/>
&gt; technology.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A member named POCKETCHANGE responds with this note: &quot;Having<br/>
&gt; spent several years in the teflon coating business and<br/>
&gt; knowing firsthand the pitfalls involved in the application<br/>
&gt; process, it should be noted the problem is EXCESS HEAT.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Exactly right. I happened to catch that airing of 20/20, and<br/>
&gt; it was an eye-opener. Representatives from an activist<br/>
&gt; organization called the Environmental Working Group<br/>
&gt; demonstrated how a Teflon coated pan can easily reach a<br/>
&gt; temperature of 500 degrees while cooking bacon. At that<br/>
&gt; temperature, they claim that ultrafine particles may be<br/>
&gt; released from the pan. And at around 680 degrees, the pan<br/>
&gt; will begin to emit toxic gases. When inhaled, the gases may<br/>
&gt; cause a reaction with symptoms that are typical of the flu,<br/>
&gt; including a temperature several degrees above normal,<br/>
&gt; chills, headache, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; DuPont&#39;s vice president of research and development, Uma<br/>
&gt; Chowdhry, was interviewed by 20/20, and when asked about the<br/>
&gt; Teflon flu she admitted that heated Teflon does emit fumes<br/>
&gt; which can cause a &quot;flu-like symptom, which is reversible.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Somehow that doesn&#39;t put my mind at ease.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And Roz agrees, saying, &quot;... proof has been found that DuPont<br/>
&gt; has known for a long time of the dangers of Teflon. Well,<br/>
&gt; that enough for me - out goes the 2 small skillets and 2<br/>
&gt; small pots I&#39;ve been using. And back to the trusty ole cast-<br/>
&gt; iron skillets and stainless steel only pots.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This comment prompts a number of responses about different<br/>
&gt; kinds of cookware, including this caution from Voila: &quot;I<br/>
&gt; have heard stainless steel is not really recommended either.<br/>
&gt; It is made with nickel, a highly poisonous substance.&quot; And a<br/>
&gt; member named Bob adds, &quot;A reminder to everyone not to use<br/>
&gt; aluminum pots & pans as aluminum is associated with<br/>
&gt; Alzheimers.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A member named Owen follows Bob&#39;s comment with this<br/>
&gt; intriguing posting: &quot;Our bodies don&#39;t normally like to store<br/>
&gt; aluminum compounds in our cells. Aluminum isn&#39;t readily<br/>
&gt; absorbed -- UNLESS it&#39;s in the presence of fluoride. Put<br/>
&gt; fluoride and aluminum together in your body, and you&#39;re in<br/>
&gt; deep trouble. When you cook with fluoridated tap water in an<br/>
&gt; aluminum pan, you increase the aluminum concentration of<br/>
&gt; your food by up to 800 times.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; These and other more detailed comments about cookware and<br/>
&gt; Teflon are certainly worth reflecting on as we reheat<br/>
&gt; Thanksgiving leftovers this weekend.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A wide variety of health topics are being discussed on the<br/>
&gt; HSI Forum this week, including omega-3, glycemic index,<br/>
&gt; mercury tooth fillings, HepA outbreak, burning feet, Epstein<br/>
&gt; Barr virus, and in a thread titled &quot;Sugar in Cocoa&quot; a member<br/>
&gt; named Lisa comes to the defense of cocoa with a recipe that<br/>
&gt; avoids sugar in this winter warmer that has high levels of<br/>
&gt; antioxidants. Log on to our web site at www.hsibaltimore.com<br/>
&gt; to join in with these and other informative conversations<br/>
&gt; about natural health alternatives.<br/>

&gt; An amazing new CoQ10 breakthrough<br/>
&gt; Doctors have been recommending CoQ10 as part of a heart-<br/>
&gt; healthy regimen for years. Now there&#39;s a powerful, great-<br/>
&gt; tasting way to infuse your cells with the free radical<br/>
&gt; fighting power of coenzyme Q10. A new product called CoQmelt<br/>
&gt; delivers a rapid, direct dose of 100 mg of CoQ10, without<br/>
&gt; swallowing a pill. Find out how you can benefit from this<br/>
&gt; breakthrough in bio-absorption technology.<br/>

&gt; The House Always Wins<br/>
&gt; Reports about a study of the cholesterol-lowering statin<br/>
&gt; drug Lipitor might have left you with the impression that<br/>
&gt; this best-selling drug proved to be more effective than one<br/>
&gt; of its rivals, Pravachol. A closer look, however, reveals a<br/>
&gt; train wreck of misconceptions behind the headlines, as well<br/>
&gt; as some medical advice that borders on being downright<br/>
&gt; dangerous.<br/>

&gt; Looking Good<br/>
&gt; One of the most pervasive vision problems that affect us as<br/>
&gt; we grow older is age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Now<br/>
&gt; a new study from Johns Hopkins provides strong confirmation<br/>
&gt; of a 2001 breakthrough study in which certain supplements<br/>
&gt; were shown to be effective in helping prevent the<br/>
&gt; development of AMD. We&#39;ll tell you about the health factors<br/>
&gt; that create the greatest risk for AMD vision loss, as well<br/>
&gt; as which supplements and other nutrients may help reduce<br/>
&gt; your risk.<br/>

&gt; Easy Does It<br/>
&gt; If you eat when you feel stressed, don&#39;t be too hard on<br/>
&gt; yourself, because a new study reveals that your desire to<br/>
&gt; load up on comfort food isn&#39;t the result of a weak will;<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s a powerful need, driven by your body&#39;s biological<br/>
&gt; reaction to stress. We&#39;ll tell you how you can redirect<br/>
&gt; this &quot;need&quot; to manage both stress and weight control.<br/>
