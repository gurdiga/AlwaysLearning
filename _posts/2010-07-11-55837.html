For me personally, if someone is forcing me to do something that I  <br/>
don&#39;t want to do, they&#39;ve taken control away from me.<br/>
<br/>
If someone denies me something, I still have the option (even if the  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2054618696">After my husband and I became vegetarians, our girls did eat meat a few times. But after a while, eating so much yummy vegetarian food, the meat just become unappealing. So that wasn&#39;t really a big deal for us. I do, however, sometimes wonder how to deal with &quot;boys&quot;. We have 3 girls and our oldest is 14. <br/>
<br/>
Since the girls haven&#39;t been to public school in over 3 years, and we moved about 8 months ago, they just haven&#39;t had any opportunities to be seriously interested in any boys. That&#39;s a relief to me. But, I do wonder the best way to handle that as they get older. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m kind of torn in my thinking. On the one hand, I think it&#39;s probably better if they explore relationships while they&#39;re here with us, so that we can be there for them. On the other hand, I became pregnant with our oldest when I was 16, so &quot;boyfriends&quot; scare me a little. I don&#39;t think my husband would be okay with them dating until their 18. We haven&#39;t really discussed it, since it just hasn&#39;t come up. <br/>
<br/>
I talk to my girls sometimes about sex and relationships. The first time I had sex, I didn&#39;t really mean to. It progressed from making out to sex so quickly I was truly taken by surprise. So, when the topic comes up I&#39;ll talk to them about how to avoid situations like that so you don&#39;t have sex before you are ready. <br/>
<br/>
The last time we talked about sex, I explained that sperm could leak out at any time during sex, not just &quot;at the end&quot;, and that sometimes it can be hard for a guy to stop, so that&#39;s why it&#39;s important for a guy to use a condom the entire time. The girls were horrified, lol. So, I kind of struggle with that as well. I want them to have the information well ahead of when they&#39;ll actually need it. But it&#39;s hard to know when the right time is to share things like that with them. <br/>

prodded. I&#39;ve said not now or delayed or asked to wait, but I can&#39;t remember <br/>
denying something, certainly not something sweeping like meat. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Simon, David and Linnaea have in their own turns and times been vegetarian. I <br/>
never have. Each of our diets have been accomodated by David and me. I can&#39;t <br/>
imagine telling Linnaea that she had to eat meat anymore than I can imagine <br/>
making Simon eat lima beans (my childhood fear). I can&#39;t imagine telling Linnaea <br/>
that she couldn&#39;t eat meat anymore than I can imagine telling David he couldn&#39;t <br/>
eat bananas. <br/>

<br/>
Our home is some place I want all of us to feel comfortable and safe and happy <br/>
in. Using the not under my roof clause for things like dietary consideration, <br/>
well, I don&#39;t know how comfortable that would make any one of us feel. Certainly <br/>
it would be less homey round here.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;to force&quot; is too broad a term.  Force food into their mouths?  Force  <br/>
them into their rooms and lock the door?<br/>
<br/>
Or by &quot;to force&quot; do you mean set conditions on not doing the thing  <br/>
(punishment)?  Or extract agreements to do things (persuasion or  <br/>
manipulation)?<br/>
<br/>
And deny them what?<br/>
Not let them play with a gameboy that&#39;s sitting right in that room?<br/>
Or not let them study circus contortion in China?<br/>
Again, too broad a range for me to guess.<br/>
<br/>
Can you give realistic examples of what you&#39;re asking about?<br/>

-=-<br/>
<br/>
Instead of rules or arbitrary ages, recast all those thoughts in terms  <br/>
of principles.<br/>
<br/>
Safety.<br/>
Courtesy.<br/>
Compassion.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t think of it as &quot;dating.&quot;  Break outings down into what they are-- <br/>
going to a party, going to a gaming session, going to a conference and  <br/>
hanging out with other kids, visiting the neighbors*, going out to  <br/>
eat, going to a movie.<br/>
<br/>
Some of those are more &quot;date like&quot; than others, if it&#39;s one boy taking  <br/>
one girl, but my kids have very rarely ever been in &quot;date&quot; situations.<br/>
<br/>
The * from two paragraphs up refers to a neighbor of mine who was  <br/>
forbidden to date, or even drive around with me.  Hispanic old  <br/>
northern New Mexico family.  She was &quot;going out with&quot; (in school, her  <br/>
boyfriend of record) a guy from Santa Clara Pueblo.  Her parents would  <br/>
NOT (not, not) have let her date Indians, if they had let her date  <br/>
anybody.<br/>
<br/>
So they met at my house.  Her mother would let her walk down to my  <br/>
house and hang out.  My parents didn&#39;t mind me being friends with  <br/>
Indians at all.  They &quot;hung out&quot; in private, with the door closed.   <br/>
They didn&#39;t &quot;go all the way,&quot; in 60&#39;s parlance, but they did more than  <br/>
her mom would&#39;ve liked just by both being under the same roof.  Of  <br/>
course at school they were under the same roof, in the same room,  <br/>
holding hands, sharing lunch, walking down to the river (our school  <br/>
was right on the Rio Grande)...<br/>
<br/>
So sometimes parents think they&#39;re limiting a child and children have  <br/>
known for centuries how to maintain the illusion without being  <br/>
controlled.<br/>
<br/>
If your daughters are knowledgeable that will help keep them safe.<br/>
NOTHING ON EARTH will keep them as safe as them knowing that if they  <br/>
want a rescue from a difficult situation, you will come and get them  <br/>
without shaming them, without punishing them, without further trying  <br/>
to limit them.<br/>
Trust.<br/>
If they trust you, you will be able to trust them.<br/>
If they don&#39;t trust you, then they won&#39;t be honest with you.<br/>

<br/>
It can help to step away from the idea of &quot;dating&quot; and think about your kids spending time with other people, socializing and learning about themselves and relationships. They already Know some things about themselves and relationships, regardless of what&#39;s been said openly. <br/>
<br/>
How&#39;s your relationship with your girls? What&#39;s the communication like? How do they get along with each other?<br/>
<br/>
Those are things that will feed into other relationships. If they&#39;re used to one person bossing others (parents, siblings) that&#39;s going to matter in other relationships. If they&#39;re used to &quot;I don&#39;t know what I want&quot; being an invitation for another person to snatch decision making away from them, that will matter in other relationships - &quot;casual&quot; friendships as much as romance.  <br/>
<br/>
If &quot;not okay with&quot; means &quot;won&#39;t let&quot; (or will put pressure on the girls to avoid) that&#39;s not going to help your girls have a good sense of their own boundaries or confidence in their ability to communicate with other people. &quot;Not letting&quot; girls make their own decisions sets them up for someone else making their decisions in other ways - friends pushing them to do things they aren&#39;t sure they want to do, or their own hormones pushing them, for that matter. <br/>

This is interesting to me.  My dd is 11 & her newest best friend, is a boy,<br/>

Holding hands? Driving themselves to places without a parent with them?<br/>
Yesterday I took them to the mall.  They wandered around & shopped while I<br/>
hung out at the food court & read my kindle.  It would never occur to me<br/>
that I could &quot;prevent&quot; my  kids from dating, if that is what they wanted.<br/>

okay with them dating until their 18. We haven&#39;t really discussed it, since it <br/>
just hasn&#39;t come up. ***<br/>
<br/>
Were you allowed to date and have sex?<br/>
<br/>
There is a whole forest by my house full of used condoms and underwear of <br/>
teenagers having sex, hiding it from those that think they shouldn&#39;t be.<br/>
<br/>
If they aren&#39;t allowed to date or have sex, and they find someone in which <br/>
they&#39;d like to do both, they WILL hide it.  It&#39;s such a huge and powerful thing, <br/>
biologically driven, that I don&#39;t think any parent can prevent it, even if they <br/>
think they are and have good reasons for doing so.<br/>
<br/>
I think one of the things our culture does to teens that is hugely damaging, is <br/>
to not believe in their ability to be in healthy lasting relationships.  It <br/>
doesn&#39;t necessarily mean forever relationships, but teens can be in committed <br/>
relationships, they can communicate and work things out.  So many parents don&#39;t <br/>
believe this and diminish this potential by thinking things like &quot;puppy love&quot; or <br/>
other diminutive sorts of ideas about teens and relationships.  In many ways <br/>
it&#39;s created teens that will only do short term non-committal relationships, <br/>
like fads of jeans, they trade it in for the next one.  Those kinds of <br/>
relationships, I think, are more painful and damaging.<br/>
<br/>
Dating can be casual, get to know the other person kind of things.  That&#39;s not <br/>
what I&#39;m talking about though.  If your girls aren&#39;t interested, then no big <br/>
deal.  Chamille wasn&#39;t interested at all, and it hit her hard when she or we <br/>
weren&#39;t expecting it at all.  Chamille was never one of those girls swooning <br/>
over all the cute boys.  She was never thinking about the day that she &quot;finally&quot; <br/>
had a boyfriend.  She just wanted friends and it didn&#39;t matter if they were boys <br/>
or girls, she just wanted friends with common interests, what she found was a <br/>
boy in which they were immediately drawn together, very powerfully.  Neither one <br/>
of them expected that.  They&#39;ve been together for 1.25 yrs.  Chamille is 16 and <br/>
her boyfriend is 14.<br/>
<br/>
They aren&#39;t always mature, they get in arguments, they cry and sometimes are <br/>
overly emotional with each other, BUT they work things out, sometimes more <br/>
maturely than some adults I know.<br/>
<br/>
My personal belief is that, parents shouldn&#39;t enforce abstinence, but discuss <br/>
sex in realistic ways.  Helping kids know how to say &quot;no&quot; or &quot;yes&quot; in a healthy <br/>
way goes a lot farther than saying &quot;no, wrong, shouldn&#39;t do it, don&#39;t do it.&quot; <br/>
 That cuts off communication surrounding sex and relationships.  Most parents <br/>
would rather be in the &quot;know&quot; in that regard, for many reasons, one being <br/>
medical, and another being safety, and the biggest, to prevent pregnancies that <br/>
aren&#39;t wanted.  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s *my* opinion.  <br/>
<br/>
One of our neighbor&#39;s daughters got pregnant and didn&#39;t tell anyone until it was <br/>
well past the time she could have an abortion, didn&#39;t want to have a baby, but <br/>
was afraid to tell her dad that she&#39;d gotten pregnant because she wasn&#39;t <br/>
supposed to be having sex.  She was 16 and hid her pregnancy until it was no <br/>
longer possible to do so.  <br/>
<br/>
***The girls were horrified, lol. So, I kind of struggle with that as well. I <br/>
want them to have the information well ahead of when they&#39;ll actually need it. <br/>
But it&#39;s hard to know when the right time is to share things like that with <br/>
them.***<br/>
<br/>
If they were horrified, find a better way!  We&#39;ve always talked about sex in a <br/>
very candid way at our house.  When the kids are small, give small simple <br/>
answers, as they get older give bigger and more complex answers, as long as they <br/>
are receptive.  My kids have always been receptive, in part because we are <br/>
candid about it.  Chamille is the most private person about &quot;body&quot; anything, yet <br/>
we still find ways to talk about this sort of thing because it&#39;s valuable <br/>
information, just like any other valuable life learning thing! <br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>By the time I was 18, I had been dating my future husband for 1.5 years, and I had *known* for quite some time that he&#39;d be my life partner--marriage wasn&#39;t yet on our minds, but we called each other soulmates. I&#39;d actually fallen for him the first time I ever saw him at age 14.<br/>
<br/>
Both my parents were less than thrilled about him, especially when we made it clear that he would be me at college; but 22 years later, they are thrilled that he is my husband and that we are still together despite having undergone some pretty serious stuff together (starting, running, and ending a business with his parents; losing all our homes to fire; surviving a serious head injury; amongst other things). <br/>
<br/>
Even if my parents had denied me from dating him, I would&#39;ve found a way to see him no matter what. Even if that involved lying, sneaking out, or other means. I would&#39;ve much preferred my relationship to be something that I could share openly with my parents, like we did with his parents who welcomed me into their family with open arms. <br/>
<br/>
After experiencing the way his parents brought me into their lives, I knew that I wanted to experience my childrens&#39; relationships the way his parents did. It has always been more fun, open, and free with my husband&#39;s family than with mine. It still is.</div>

<br/>
YES YES YES! And YES!  Most of the teens I know right now really don&#39;t like <br/>
dating, it&#39;s too formal and stilted, with an expectation underlying it.  It&#39;s <br/>
better to get to know another in and around lots of settings within a group, or <br/>
out alone seeing a movie, or getting ice cream, or hanging out and listening to <br/>
music.<br/>

<br/>
Not to mention a shoulder to cry on under those stressful circumstances in which <br/>
a teen might need rescuing!  That will also allow for further conversation and <br/>
how to avoid that kind of trouble in the future.  If parents are obstacles in a <br/>
rescue, they won&#39;t be called upon, nor will they ever get a chance to know about <br/>
the situation, or to give helpful input as the person with possibly more <br/>
knowledge, the person with whom helpful ideas could be attained or at least <br/>
talked through.  I see that happen ALL the time!  Even with kids with relatively <br/>
&quot;nice&quot; parents, the parents are kept out of the loop on really big and important <br/>
information, information that I would never, as a parent, want to be kept out of <br/>
the loop on!  <br/>
<br/>
Chamille and I have heard it all!  Kids just hide stuff from their parents if <br/>
they know their parents would not approve.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1612660600"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;I think one of the things our culture does to teens that is hugely damaging, is to not believe in their ability to be in healthy lasting relationships.  It doesn&#39;t necessarily mean forever relationships...&lt;&lt;&lt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And sometimes it does. My parents met at age 14, married at age 19, and are still together 46 years later. My in-laws married while my mother-in-law was still in high school, when she was 17! Gave her a good reason to move out of her mother&#39;s house and they are still together 44 years later. And then there is my husband and me...met at age 14, dated briefly, he then dated nearly all my best friends, and we started seriously dating when I was 17. We are about to celebrate our 16th wedding anniversary, and we&#39;ve been together for 22 years. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;If they were horrified, find a better way!  We&#39;ve always talked about sex in a very candid way at our house.  When the kids are small, give small simple answers, as they get older give bigger and more complex answers, as long as they are receptive.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree. As a home-birthing Mama, the topic came up early. As a Doula, the topic has come up quite a bit. I provide short, easy answers. The other day I overheard Signe (4) ask her sister why girl dogs have a yoni (vagina). Nena (8 this week) said, &quot;because that&#39;s where the boy dog puts his penis so they can have puppies, and that&#39;s how the puppies come out.&quot; Simple, to the point.  They moved on to some Wizards of Waverly Place discussion immediately after that.</div>

I don&#39;t know whether to tell them he won&#39;t let them sleep together.   <br/>
I&#39;m not sure.  Maybe that was Keith&#39;s mom&#39;s rule and he WOULD let  <br/>
them.  It&#39;s a hard question to call a 92 year old guy and ask.     <br/>

<br/>
Oh, that&#39;s FUNNY!!<br/>
<br/>
One time Keith&#39;s mom was trying to put me and Keith in one room and  <br/>
the kids in the den three rooms away.  We rearranged ourselves so that  <br/>
Holly (who was nursing) was with me, and the boys and Keith were in  <br/>
the den (where they could watch TV).<br/>
<br/>
His mom seemed all flustered.  She didn&#39;t get it; she didn&#39;t like it;  <br/>
she didn&#39;t know how to act.<br/>
<br/>
But after that she just used to let us arrange ourselves however we  <br/>
wanted to.<br/>
<br/>
Once when Marty was nine and had a new puppy, we took the puppy.  They  <br/>
had had a dog all of Keith&#39;s life, but their dog had died just a year  <br/>
or so before.  I didn&#39;t think she would mind, but apparently she had  <br/>
de-dog-haired everything and didn&#39;t want the puppy in.  No problem,  <br/>
Keith said, and he, Marty, Kirby and the dog made beds on the patio.  <br/>
(We had taking to carrying folding futons with us whenever we went  <br/>
there anyway, so it was our bedding and not hers.)<br/>
<br/>
There was a thunder and rain storm and she got up to check on them, to  <br/>
find out Holly and I had already gotten up to check on them.  They  <br/>
were having adventurous fun, so that was fine.   She did soften up,  <br/>
though, partly because there was no argument, there was no resentment,  <br/>
just solutions and niceness.<br/>

untangle the situation.<br/>

<br/>
You don&#39;t let go and trust, I don&#39;t think, because they don&#39;t trust  <br/>
YOU yet.  And they can&#39;t, really.  Not yet.<br/>
But you could be less arbitrary in your rules, maybe.  And less  <br/>
punitive in punishments.  And gradually, over a few months, it could  <br/>
get much better.<br/>
<br/>
-=-they (girls) have started with controlling their brother 5yrs and<br/>

<br/>
This could be a wonderful tool for you all:  Ask them to help you do  <br/>
for him what you now wish you had done for them.<br/>
They could be healed some by helping you figure out how a better way  <br/>
to be would be.  And as those resentments and jealousies come out  <br/>
(&quot;You didn&#39;t let ME do that!&quot;) you could talk through those things,  <br/>
tell them you wish you had, that you wish you could have a do-over,  <br/>
and have another hug and apology.  Talk to them about your own  <br/>
upbringing, in those moments, maybe.  Talk to them about how you hope  <br/>
they will be with their own children, if they&#39;re in the mood to discuss.<br/>
<br/>
They might not want to discuss it much at first.  Don&#39;t make them.   <br/>
Let them get it by little bits and give them time to think.  With your  <br/>
husband, too.  Don&#39;t push and rush.  The fact that you&#39;ve changed your  <br/>
mind will prevent further damage.  Undoing years of behavior is going  <br/>
to take over a year to untangle.<br/>
<br/>
It can help to ask the kids questions.  What are the rules of the  <br/>
other families they hang around with?  Are some stricter?  Less  <br/>
strict? What do they think would be good in a particular situation?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
My kids are grown, so I have more ability to run around now.<br/>
Get me soon before I&#39;m too old to travel, but it wouldn&#39;t need to be  <br/>
&quot;a conference,&quot; it could be a more informal gathering with discussions.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s possible that you would gain more benefit, though, by travelling  <br/>
where there are lots of unschoolers and their children, to a  <br/>
conference in the U.S. or England.  There&#39;s a big think happening in  <br/>
Australia later this year.<br/>
<br/>
Where&#39;s the newish site with the great conference listings?<br/>

See what they&#39;re doing as an attempt on their part to be responsible and do the &quot;right&quot; thing.

It can help to think about transitions and how everyone in your family handles transitions - this is going to be a months-long transition, so be easy and gentle with everyone, including yourself and your dh. <br/>

<br/>
You may need to accept the fact that they may do what you fear.  That&#39;s part of <br/>
trusting a person, knowing that they may do what you don&#39;t want them to do.  The <br/>
difference will be in what you do AFTER that happens.  If you accept it as a <br/>
mistake to learn from, something to talk about and not something that vindicates <br/>
you, as the parent, or gives you cause to shame and control, you&#39;ll be one step <br/>
in proving to your kids that they can be trusted and that YOU can be trusted.<br/>
<br/>
My husband just got a birthday present.  We helped him get some very very cheap <br/>
musical equipment.  A parent put them up for sale to punish his kid for smoking <br/>
pot.  We went back and forth on whether we wanted any part in that, but the <br/>
price was something we could afford right now and so far from what something <br/>
like that would go for, even used.  The kid wasn&#39;t home and didn&#39;t know what he <br/>
was going home to.  I&#39;m sure it was yucky.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the thing, that kid isn&#39;t going to learn that smoking pot is bad and <br/>
change his behavior.  He&#39;s going to learn that his parents are mean and <br/>
vindictive, that they have no understanding, that they are inflexible, not to be <br/>
trusted, and people that aren&#39;t to be relied on as a soft landing when things <br/>
get hard.  Kids make mistakes.  People make mistakes.  <br/>
<br/>
When you make a mistake in your relationship, how do you want your husband to <br/>
respond to it?  Do you want him to take away your phone privilege, or tell you <br/>
that you can&#39;t go out for coffee with your best girl friend because you <br/>
neglected to do the dishes and cook dinner?  I&#39;m not even saying that those <br/>
things are mistakes in a relationship, but if it&#39;s what you usually do and if <br/>
it&#39;s expected and you don&#39;t do it, it could feel that way.  It would be <br/>
manipulative and controlling, the same thing that you are trying to do to your <br/>
kids to get them to do what you want them to do.<br/>
<br/>
When I look into these kinds of relationships, where the parents are punitive <br/>
and inflexible, and/or controlling and manipulative, the most immediate thing <br/>
that I notice that can change is for a parent to take the time to listen, even <br/>
when the child is angry and disrespectful.  Listen.  Don&#39;t react, just listen, <br/>
and hear the words that are being said behind the emotions.  Take that to heart. <br/>
 Those strong emotions are there because the child feels disrespected deeply and <br/>
wounded from your actions and inactions.  THAT is really really hard to hear, <br/>
but hearing it could very well be the thing that changes everything.<br/>
<br/>
The next time one of your girls is angry or rebellious or disrespectful towards <br/>
you, take a deep breath and listen and then ask them for a remedy to the <br/>
situation.  Ask them how they want it to be different.  Then DO that.  Actions <br/>
speak so much louder than words, even apologies.  Apologies mean nothing without <br/>
action.  Undoing damage will take time and continuous action on your part to do <br/>
better.  The onus is on you. <br/>
 <br/>

I&#39;m 45 and I don&#39;t live with my parents. They are 20 minutes away and<br/>
we don&#39;t see each other much. We have a 7 year old boy. I would LUV<br/>

&gt; Pam &quot; it only takes a second to do better&quot;  written on my wall but i feel<br/>
&gt; that the knots r so tight feel a bit overwhelmed with the huge damage i have<br/>
&gt; caused, they (girls) have started with controlling their brother 5yrs and<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s a struggle to get them to back  off their brother. they doing to Him<br/>
&gt; what i did to them....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; i need some DAMAGE UNDO, advise, please. Also mtyhusband is still not seeing<br/>
&gt; it yet fully, he thinks, &quot;Let just put more restrictions and punish them if<br/>
&gt; the do wrong&quot; theory.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thank you so much for all the work u guys are doing with liberating parents<br/>
&gt; and kids, we need this kind of parenting in South Africa...... who knows<br/>
&gt; maybe i invite Sandra to come hold an unschooling&#92; parenting confrence...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1335068952">Hi All<br/>
<br/>
ive just found this post, i was searching for the replys to my questions. i<br/>
found it in my sentbox.Thank you for the links and the answers. i feel like<br/>
im getting a do over with my son, but it feels overwhelming with the girls.<br/>
i have a really negative thought pattern when it gets to the girls and i<br/>
have alot of guilt cuz im surposed to love being with my girls but i dont. i<br/>
was away for a day and riding back i realised how i hated going home to<br/>
them. how do i love being with them???? do i have to fake it until i feel<br/>
it??? is something seriously wrong with me or are we just going through a<br/>
rough patch. ( i love to spend time with my son 5yrs)<br/>
<br/>
I have tried the &quot;thinking positive thoughts&quot; meditation but it seems my<br/>
expectations are high for my girls because we homeschool and my family<br/>
expect more from them. would hipnosis help me or should we go for family<br/>
counceling? the &quot;experts her in South Africa are a bit conservative  and<br/>
textbookish. i know im the problem and need help to get over it. we also<br/>
live in a small town, so dont have much options<br/>
<br/>
we are doing alot of movie watch to connect, but the guilt of TV watching<br/>
during the day is something fierce..not to mention the &quot;schoolwork&#39; we dont<br/>
have much of a social life as everybody is in school during the week and<br/>
weekends is family, so we are a bit desprete for freinds.<br/>
<br/>
please send somemore links on teen girls and natural learning links...<br/>
<br/>
thank you Susan Steynberg<br/>

<br/>
Can you stop having extra expectations on the girls?  Perhaps instead of <br/>
thinking positive thoughts, in a general sense, think something positive about <br/>
each of your kids.  Teen girls can be emotional and needy.  When I&#39;m feeling <br/>
overwhelmed by that, it helps for me to re frame the way that I&#39;m seeing things. <br/>
 I take a huge deep breath and turn towards something different, something <br/>
pleasant, then I think as many positive things about my girl, so that when I <br/>
turn to face her, I&#39;m seeing her as those things instead of the negative <br/>
intensity that I&#39;d just felt.  I&#39;ll tell a joke or ask a question and then let <br/>
her talk so that I can listen, and while that&#39;s happening, I&#39;ll do something for <br/>
her like make her a snack or pick up her room or find something funny online to <br/>
show her.  About half an hour later, she&#39;s no longer feeling emotional and <br/>
needy, and I&#39;m no longer annoyed by it!<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t take but a moment to change the whole atmosphere around me.  It only <br/>
takes a moment to reconnect and find something joyful.  In fact, it takes far <br/>
more time to walk away and be upset about it. <br/>
<br/>
***We are doing alot of movie watch to connect, but the guilt of TV watching<br/>

have much of a social life as everybody is in school during the week and<br/>
weekends is family, so we are a bit desprete for freinds.***<br/>
<br/>
Why is there guilt watching TV during the day?  Does it have to be TV, can it be <br/>
movies online or youtube videos?  What about music videos, or music sharing?  <br/>
<br/>
Not knowing the laws in South Africa, why are you doing schoolwork?  Is it <br/>
something that needs to happen?  Is it open and flexible?  Can movies be a part <br/>
of the schoolwork?  Does the weekend have to be family?  Can the girls find <br/>
friends to include in family?  That would make it really difficult to have a <br/>
social life as a teen, if weekends were out.  My oldest has several friends that <br/>
she loves to spend time with.  The ONLY way that we were able to make it happen <br/>
was to be hugely flexible about when we were available.  Since her friends <br/>
mostly go to school, and have homework and other obligations, it helped that we <br/>
could work around their schedules with our flexible one.  If weekends were out, <br/>
she wouldn&#39;t have many friends, honestly, and not because her friends didn&#39;t <br/>
like her or want to spend time with her, but because for school kids, weekends <br/>
ARE the time they can hang out and do things.<br/>
<br/>
Desperation isn&#39;t good for unschooling.  If the girls are desperate for friends, <br/>
then make it happen.  Open the weekend if you need to.  Once the girls are <br/>
feeling less desperate, you may find that you like them more, they&#39;ll be more <br/>
joyful.  They&#39;ll come home and tell you fun stories and you&#39;ll get to meet <br/>
interesting kids and they&#39;ll be able to share different food ideas and different <br/>
music and movies and all sorts of cool things like that.  That&#39;s what happens <br/>
when you meet new people, they bring newness and ideas into your lives.  It&#39;s <br/>
especially important for teenagers to experience that if that is what they want. <br/>
 Some teens don&#39;t care too much about all that, but if you have ones that do, it <br/>
can make the difference between peace and joy in your house, or resentment and <br/>
unhappiness with a potential of the kids going to school.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have tried the &quot;thinking positive thoughts&quot; meditatio<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I suspect most people&#39;s idea of thinking positive thoughts is to stuff  <br/>
down the negative thoughts and cover them with &quot;right&quot; thinking.  <br/>
That&#39;s works as well as painting over rotten wood.<br/>
<br/>
The effective way is to determinedly turn away from negative thoughts.  <br/>
Recognize they aren&#39;t good for relationships. Recognize to build  <br/>
relationships you need to focus on the good. Each time you have a  <br/>
negative thought, think of *specific* things you love, like or admire  <br/>
about your daughters. Don&#39;t just paint over negative thoughts with  <br/>
vague generic good thoughts. Replace them with real, positive thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
Negative thoughts are like ruts in the road. Despite good solid road,  <br/>
the wheels tend to fall into them, making them deeper. To keep them  <br/>
from getting deeper, to help them fill in, you need to physically pull  <br/>
your thoughts out of them and give them good solid road to travel on.  <br/>
The more you do that, the more<br/>
