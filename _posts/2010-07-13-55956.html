<div id="ygrps-yiv-14134789">This isn&#39;t a very informed/informative article in my opinion. It comes<br/>
from The New York Times.<br/>
<br/>
What do you think of it?<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the blurb:<br/>
“We have racked our brains trying to figure why our son treats us this<br/>
way,” he told me. “We don’t know what we did to deserve this.”<br/>
Apparently very little, as far as I could tell.<br/>

by someone supposedly qualified to analyze it.  :/    and that second <br/>
patient who just REPORTED that his son was rude and wouldn&#39;t call his mother <br/>
on her birthday?  does this psychiatrist not understand that there are <br/>
subtle dynamics to relationships that can never be fully and accurately <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-224291450">-=-I find that article despicable-=-<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t think it was despicable.<br/>
Some people know they have a sweet &quot;easy&quot; child, even in the midst of  <br/>
other children from the same tow parents.<br/>
<br/>
If there is such a thing as a easy child, there is such a thing as a  <br/>
difficult child.  If there&#39;s such a thing as a naturally kind and  <br/>
gentle child, there must be such a thing as a harsh, impatient chile  <br/>
who lacks compassion.<br/>
<br/>
On top of that simple genetic likelihood, there are factors such as  <br/>
fetal alcohol syndrome, which can keep a person from synthesizing a  <br/>
plan from information he can recite--he might know the whole schedule  <br/>
for the day and be able to tell you, but then not be able to figure  <br/>
out if there&#39;s time for a movie in the midst of it, or not be able to  <br/>
know what that means in terms of his actions and need to leave early  <br/>
to be places.  Some fetal alcohol kids don&#39;t develop a conscience (and  <br/>
it&#39;s probably related to the same inability to &quot;put one and one  <br/>
together.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then there are adoptions.  Some people so cover over their adoptions  <br/>
that they get a new birth certificate made (which is the most horrible  <br/>
abuse of public records I can imagine, to falsify birth and  <br/>
parentage).   And they want to teach the rest of the world a lesson,  <br/>
so they don&#39;t ever discuss the adoption.   And then they are resentful  <br/>
and appalled if that child has the characteristics of his birth  <br/>
parents, or the effects of separation.<br/>
<br/>
Genetics are real.   Patience and emotional range are biochemical, and  <br/>
biochemistry is probably as individual as the shape of noses and ears  <br/>
and the texture and color of hair.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1605126117">while I completely agree that genetics and biology are real and parents shouldn&#39;t be blamed across the board for their child&#39;s genetic or biological/chemical makeup (thank goodness for that or I&#39;d be in trouble as a parent), to call a &quot;difficult child&quot; a &quot;bad seed&quot; is such a copout in terms of the parental responsibility to meet THAT child&#39;s needs, no matter how challenging, and the story about the adult who wouldn&#39;t call his mother on her birthday, to me, offered no  evidence or compelling argument for genetic or chemical influences - there was NOTHING about that relationship, really, first hand.  also, adoption and fetal alcohol syndrome etc, would make for an obvious &quot;reason&quot; for &quot;bad seedishness&quot; that would have been mentioned by the psychiatrist - not just - bad seed, no reason, if that makes any sense.  <br/>

The article wasn&#39;t a full analysis of a child&#39;s entire life and his  <br/>
parents&#39; entire upbringing and their genetic breakdown, though.  It  <br/>
was suggesting that it&#39;s possible that some kids aren&#39;t a &quot;good&quot; as  <br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
No matter what a child&#39;s potential in any &quot;intelligence&quot; or physical  <br/>
or emotional attributes, good parenting can make it better.  Bad  <br/>
parenting can make it worse.<br/>
<br/>
This list is about how parenting can make things better, and how an  <br/>
trusting atmosphere filled with opportunities for learning can help  <br/>
people be whole, hale, happy adults.  Or make it more likely.<br/>
<br/>
There are no guarantees.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Birth, maybe. Not parentage.<br/>
<br/>
I have mixed feelings about re-issued birth certificates, but it&#39;s really standard now. We were not presented with any option to do anything but have Yehva issued a new birth cert with our names as her parents as part of the process. It makes many things easier--it&#39;s one document I have to present for proof of ID and relationship, rather than 2 (birth certificate and stack of papers from the court finalizing the adoption). It does seem strange to me, though. I would have been very happy with a birth certificate that reflected both birth and adoptive parents, and then, too, that would be a record that an adult adoptee, or her descendants, could use to trace both adoptive and biological families. It would be both more honest and more complete.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the most horrible abuse of public records imaginable, though. That&#39;s awfully strong language. People use public records to track and stalk ex-girlfriends, or to steal people&#39;s identities. Those are two things that seem worse to me than my daughter&#39;s birth certificate listing as her mother the woman who took her home from the hospital and who has cared for her since instead of the woman who gave her up at birth.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  And they want to teach the rest of the world a lesson,  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is really uncommon these days. It&#39;s generally considered healthier for everyone to be honest about adoption. I suppose it&#39;s kind of ironic that there is a big movement toward open adoption at the same time that revised birth certificates have become the norm--we have tons of info about Yehva&#39;s birthparents, for instance, although we do not have a fully open adoption. In the US at least it is pretty much not done anymore to pretend that an adopted child is biological, and it&#39;s common for agencies to advocate for open adoption with both birth families and adoptive families.<br/>

<br/>
Except in the one record that has commonly been useful for people to  <br/>

<br/>
We can&#39;t discuss genetics or biology in cases of parents and &quot;bad  <br/>
seeds&quot; without discussing adoption.  I&#39;m happy not to discuss any of  <br/>
it, but we can&#39;t start with the assumption that some children are very  <br/>
different from others, and then pretend that &quot;parentage&quot; is adoptive  <br/>
parentage.<br/>

Jeff was adopted at three his adoptive parents are listed as his birth parents. It is weird they even their ages at the time of his birth! They didn&#39;t even know him. <br/>
<br/>
I remember the first time I heard about this was when I saw my highschool best friend&#39;s birth certificate, she was adopted. I talked about what a horrible injustice it was and how wrong it was to every and anyone that would listen. It was my first taste of  what I saw as *government lies*<br/>
<br/>
I think they should have some other notation. Wipe off the other parents, okay, but label the new ones as adopted. I think the effort is two-fold. Allow the adoptive parents not to tell the children and to protect the birth parent&#39;s privacy. Neither reason is for the child&#39;s good. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-640811585">In most U.S. states those false certificates replace originals that are then &quot;sealed&quot; - kept in state custody but locked away from the person described on them. There&#39;s a movement of adult adoptees to gain access to their records without regard to whether or not such access is approved by the birth parents, on the grounds that access to the truth about oneself is a basic human right. There&#39;s an interesting history of altered birth certificates and sealed records on the Bastard Nation website at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://bastards.org/bb/">http://bastards.org/bb/</a><br/>
<br/>
&quot;The half-century old practice of impounding and sealing an adopted person&#39;s original birth records in perpetuity has had the disastrous effect of breeding deep and long lasting attitudes of shame in all areas of the adoption process. Secrets and lies abound. So we decided to reclaim the term &quot;Bastard&quot; -- to take it back and make it ours. In so doing, we hope to explode the myths of shame surrounding adoption and focus attention on the absolute necessity of changing the laws.<br/>
<br/>
We at Bastard Nation believe that there is NOTHING shameful about having been born out of wedlock or about being adopted. We selected our name because we will no longer be made to feel shamed by the odious state laws that permanently seal our original birth records. We do not fling the word &quot;bastard&quot; at anyone. Rather, we wear it proudly as we work to achieve our goal of equal and unconditional access to original birth records for all adult adoptees.&quot;  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bastards.org/whoweare">http://www.bastards.org/whoweare</a><br/>

movie &quot;Bad Seed&quot; seemed like Twilight Zone on steroids.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if it&#39;s more frequently the case many cultures aren&#39;t<br/>
nurturing (and we know culture influences childraising and ideas about<br/>
children in general) not that parents *or* children are &quot;bad.&quot;<br/>

weren&#39;t. But they were hardly bad parents. It&#39;s just that being great<br/>
at parenting wasn&#39;t their goal. I could have asked them when I was a<br/>
child and I could ask them today, and the answer would be the same.<br/>
Religion is primary. Parenting was just a role to them and we kids had<br/>
our own roles we were responsible for. That isn&#39;t MY perspective<br/>
though and it&#39;s pretty weird to me that it isn&#39;t, though I&#39;m happy to<br/>
have the view that I do. Just seeing that the way I think is ok is too<br/>
much for them and I do struggle over that rift sometimes, but less and<br/>
less as time goes by.<br/>

illegitimate was around for longer than many people realize. The ease of<br/>
DNA paternity testing as well as the high divorce rate and usage of the<br/>
testing has revealed inaccurate birth certificates did not always involve<br/>
adoption.<br/>
<br/>
Single mothers needing or asking for aid used to be pressured to name a<br/>
father..........any father........and to seek child support which was<br/>
garnisheed to repay the government assistance.<br/>
<br/>
That does not even address the falsification of biological relationships on<br/>
the birth certificates of the hundreds of thousands of children conceived by<br/>
AI going back nearly a century.  And now when the woman giving birth may<br/>
also have no biological relationship to the child...........................<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Like many &quot;records&quot;  the attempt to have birth certificates serve dual<br/>
functions (tracing biological heritage as well as designating &quot;legal&quot;<br/>
relationships) means they are not very good at either.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I think they should have some other notation. Wipe off the other parents,<br/>
&gt; okay, but label the new ones as adopted.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Whether or not the new ones are actually labelled as adopted, the<br/>
certificate itself can reflect as amended and the original be &quot;open&quot;.    I<br/>
am fascinated by &#39;old&#39; records (and love seeing the originals of released<br/>
past censuses.........the 2010 census will not be providing nearly as much<br/>
information) but have also learned that many expected &quot;corrections&quot;  had not<br/>
made it onto the originals.............particularly in the case of adult<br/>
adoptions or name changes.<br/>
<br/>
vicki<br/>
<br/>
P.S.: I strongly believe that people have the &quot;right&quot; to know their<br/>
biological heritage.........whether they were the products of enhanced<br/>
conception or were legally adopted or were &quot;taken in&quot; by friends or<br/>
relatives.   Or even if they were &quot;stolen&quot; by the state or individuals.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1140447196">-=-Especially in the 50s and 60s in my state where a child born during a<br/>
marriage had the husband listed as the father regardless of reality-=-<br/>
<br/>
That was the deal, legally, for a LONG time back in England (may more  <br/>
or all of Europe)--it&#39;s why infidelity was such a raging big deal and  <br/>
it was fairly acceptable for a man to kill his wife if he caught her  <br/>
in bed with someone. It wasn&#39;t about sin or his shame.  It was about  <br/>
inheritance.   The wife was risking causing him to be obligated to  <br/>
pass on name, money, house, property, titles maybe, to someone who  <br/>
wasn&#39;t actually his.  For poor people, it could be just the obligation  <br/>
to house and feed the child.<br/>
<br/>
The women&#39;s movement had science on its side.  Birth control was &quot;new  <br/>
improved&quot; with the pill, science could prove the presence of sperm in  <br/>
a rape case, DNA studies were coming along, and so it was no longer  <br/>
just a man&#39;s right to ignore a woman&#39;s objections about a lot of  <br/>
things, and women didn&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; have babies just because they were  <br/>
married (or having sex), so hiring them for positions of  <br/>
responsibility, and promoting them in companies, wasn&#39;t so crazy  <br/>
anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Younger women forget or never knew that.  In 1982 or so, a 19/20 year  <br/>
old friend of ours had an essay to write for English 102 and she came  <br/>
to our house. One of her options was What the Women&#39;s Movement had  <br/>
done to improve her life.   She was going to write about how it had  <br/>
done nothing to improve her life, that all the things she was able to  <br/>
do were already available to her.<br/>
<br/>
I thought of that story during the online unschooling chat Monday,  <br/>
about people who come to unschooling lately (like this year) and very  <br/>
condescendingly assure people that there&#39;s no need to be extreme or to  <br/>
use any labels, that people can just pick and choose of all the  <br/>
obvious idea lying all over the place for the picking.  (I&#39;m  <br/>
paraphrasing, but I&#39;m not exaggerating.)   And they have no idea how  <br/>
much adamant insistence on NOT diluting discussions and NOT  <br/>
compromising went into developing, trying, honing and describing  <br/>
clearly some of those ideas they think are everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
In another thread someone mentioned sayings like &quot;Time is Money&quot; and  <br/>
&quot;You have to draw the line somewhere.&quot;<br/>
There are people quoting me, Joyce, Deb, Schuyler, Anne Ohman, and  <br/>
they don&#39;t credit it because they don&#39;t know it was originally  <br/>
someone&#39;s fresh idea, recently, in the last ten years.   They don&#39;t  <br/>
think the Radical Unschooling movement did anything to improve their  <br/>
lives. :-)<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t about Bad Seeds anymore.  It&#39;s about connections.  It&#39;s  <br/>
about how the changes in history and social acceptance changes  <br/>
reality, in opportunities, birth certificates and parenting.   Some  <br/>
people enjoy knowing where their ideas came from. Some never  <br/>
considered that ideas have origins and histories.<br/>

<br/>
Yes.  What impressed me most that night at our house (I have vivid  <br/>
memories of where people were sitting and standing even) was that  <br/>
while I did expect my own strong reaction, as I was involved in lots  <br/>
of women&#39;s awareness things in the early 1970s, I didn&#39;t expect Keith  <br/>
to come on so competently to explain what she ought to write about!<br/>
<br/>
Keith grew up with older, conservative parents, the youngest of three  <br/>
boys, no sisters, and when I met him he was casually sexist and  <br/>
ignorant. :-)<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the first I saw him show what he had learned since we&#39;d been  <br/>
together, about the politics of women&#39;s this&#39;n&#39;that.<br/>
<br/>
She wrote her paper about how the women&#39;s movement HAD helped her  <br/>
life. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Some people enjoy knowing where their ideas came from. Some never <br/>
considered that ideas have origins and histories.<br/>
+++++<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe somewhere in between...or maybe both. The possibilities are infinite. <br/>
<br/>
I enjoy reading/hearing/learning histories and origins but that doesn&#39;t mean that my ideas came from there. Sometimes yes. Sometimes no. <br/>
<br/>
I was driving a friend&#39;s child to the lake, he is 5 or 6. Wolfgang was in front with me. The boy was telling me about how when we got to the lake he was going to fill up a balloon with water in the lake, to make a water balloon. <br/>
<br/>
I started to say, &quot;I&#39;m not sure that is going to work. You need...&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Wolfgang put his hand on my arm and said softly, &quot;He can discover that on his own. Can&#39;t he?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I smiled and nodded my head. The boy continued talking with excitement about all of *his* ideas. <br/>
<br/>
I hardly think he is the first person to have the idea to fill a water balloon in standing water and I don&#39;t think he was the first person to have realized it doesn&#39;t work very well for water balloons. <br/>
<br/>
Those were *his* ideas and his discoveries and the only deep history behind them might be that someone created balloons and latex but none of that necessarily influenced him. Because if those people didn&#39;t invent balloons someone else might have...maybe someone else did...but they didn&#39;t know how to get it out to people.<br/>
<br/>
Some ideas are simply logical conclusions on thought and sometimes it&#39;s impossible to conclude where or if they originated from anywhere specific. Everything is connected.<br/>
<br/>
Just because someone thought it first doesn&#39;t make it their idea. Or does it? There is a possibility that someone thought it before them but never wrote it down or shared it with anyone. <br/>
<br/>
I have an example of this...I discovered the Freedom to Learn Blog on Psychology Today back on Dr. Gray&#39;s very first post in July 2008. I posted both the first and the second entry on my local unschooling list. It spread, FAST. Now he is speaking at the Northeast Unschooling Conference. It that because I posted on our list, probably not. Was that a factor? Maybe...who knows. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only one who found it early on. I&#39;m sure I wasn&#39;t the only one who read it and thought &quot;unschooling!&quot; But it was certainly my idea at the time. I came up with that connection but it was a logical idea. I&#39;m clearly not the only one who has come up with it. <br/>
<br/>
Also, there are plenty of examples in history about parallels. Societies and people making the same discoveries without ever having contact with each other. <br/>
<br/>
Thought/ideas/conclusions are all evolutionary. They evolve for adaptive reasons, curiosity, connection or through mistakes and surprises. <br/>
<br/>
They also devolve but that&#39;s an entirely different thing isn&#39;t it? Or is it?<br/>
<br/>
There are connections, there are influences sometimes they are clear sometimes they are not either way they are everywhere. <br/>
<br/>
Life, ideas, inspiration it ebbs and flows just like thought and and ideas. <br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

<br/>
I said some, and some.  I did not say half and half.  That there were  <br/>
other degrees between those extremes was pretty clearly implied.<br/>
<br/>
Some dogs are white.  Some dogs are black.  There&#39;s no sense or  <br/>
benefit in someone saying &quot;there are also spotted dogs, and grey dogs,  <br/>
and bluish and stripey and brown dogs.<br/>
<br/>
And the possibilities are not &quot;infinite.&quot;   There are some colors that  <br/>
are not natural for dogs.<br/>
<br/>
Some things are documentable and some aren&#39;t.  Some people knowingly  <br/>
steal ideas and some people do it more innocently.<br/>
Just because some ideas (puns, jokes, combinations of foods) come up  <br/>
naturally and easily doesn&#39;t mean that EVERY recipe, joke or idea is  <br/>
likely to spontaneously appear.  There is such a thing as plagiarism  <br/>
and of knowingly lifting other people&#39;s ideas without credit.<br/>
