<div id="ygrps-yiv-1569854316">**The rather secretive church I grew up in had a yearly &quot;convention&quot; there <br/>
for <br/>
many years.<br/>
Do you ever remember lots of people showing up that had long hair (in buns) <br/>
and wearing dresses? The women of course...:)<br/>
Is Santee very large?**<br/>
<br/>
Large enough. :) Nope, never noticed anything like that. We lived there only <br/>
two years, summer of 89 to summer of 91. They were our first years as <br/>
homeschoolers. Our location was really nice for that. The pubertal person <br/>
could get out and wander the hills easily.<br/>
