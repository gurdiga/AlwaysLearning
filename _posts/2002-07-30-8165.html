<div id="ygrps-yiv-1730981187">I should add, I saw speech therapists for years as a child, I couldn&#39;t<br/>
pronouce my &quot;r&#39;s&quot; or &quot;l&#39;s&quot; at all, until i was in mid school.  And I<br/>
learned myself.  When I was in the 5th grade my m&d said no more<br/>
therapy, i would do it when it was important, and I did.  Unless I&#39;m<br/>
drunk or on benadryl or muscle relaxing drugs or when I smoked pot (in<br/>
high school) I can usually say my &quot;r&#39;s and &quot;l&#39;s&quot; now.  Not that I get<br/>
drunk often these days and I haven&#39;t smoked pot in years, but I still<br/>
have to take care to say certain words correctly.  I believe it was the<br/>
word &quot;purse&quot; that finally made me a. work hard to say my &quot;r&#39;s&quot;correctly<br/>
and b. made me NEVER  use that word.  Even today I generally say<br/>
anything else.  Just imagine a middle school girl asking a bunch of her<br/>
mean spirited peers to hand &quot;me my purse&quot; with out the &quot;r&quot; and you&#39;ll<br/>
see why.  But anyway, while I can say my r&#39;s now, I cannot nor do I even<br/>
attempt to roll them.  To me it&#39;s enough that I can say purse without<br/>
raised eyebrows.<br/>

&quot;They&quot; say (researchers) that every baby can make every sound of every <br/>
language on the planet and they do so.  And then their parents, speakers of a <br/>
language or two or three, will light up and be approving of those that sound <br/>
like the target language, and will ignore or discourage what doesn&#39;t sound <br/>
like it.  And so the babies practice and perfect the &quot;right&quot; sounds and the <br/>
wrongs sounds are sometimes extinguished.<br/>
<br/>
So if you have babies, play with all kinds of sounds.  That gurgly French <br/>
thing, that Navajo &quot;ts&quot; that sounds like Doctor Evil shushing someone (Austin <br/>
Powers reference so early in the morning...), the click that&#39;s needed for <br/>
whichever African language, the hoik Germans need...  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>You could try getting them to practice the thing when you stick your tongue<br/>
out and go &#39;pthhh&#39; (?), then try to do it inside your mouth.  Your tongue<br/>
has the same fast movement that creates the vibration needed to roll r&#39;s.<br/>
Once they get the vibration thing down then the r sound (from the throat)<br/>
can be combined with it and tada you have rolling r&#39;s.  This technique<br/>
worked for a friend of mine.<br/>

the only one in my small class that could not roll her<br/>
R&#39;s. I&#39;d never been able to do it.<br/>
<br/>
I had a 45 minute commute each way to college, so I<br/>
practiced in the car, just pushing out the rrrrr sound<br/>
and trying to roll it. Over and over and over. I must<br/>
have looked kooky driving along the highway like that<br/>
:)<br/>
<br/>
Eventually, I got it! It just took a lot of<br/>
repetition, and since I had plenty of time on my<br/>
hands, I got it.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I&#39;ve since forgotten almost all the Spanish<br/>
I learned in college and have little use for the skill<br/>
anymore, but (I just checked), I can still do it!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck :)<br/>

the back of your throat, not with the tip of the tongue.  I liked Sandra&#39;s<br/>

pesky Spanish one--not the &quot;r&quot;, but the &quot;rrrrrrr&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I can easily say &quot;Roberto&quot; with one &quot;roll&quot; on each of the r&#39;s, but I <br/>
think that second &quot;r&quot; should be a long roll, and that I can&#39;t seem to <br/>
bring it from the back of my throat to the front (YET).<br/>
<br/>
My older daughter&#39;s boyfriend (manfriend, significant other) is Hispanic <br/>
(grandparents from both sides are from Puerto Rico) and he was born <br/>
&quot;tongue-tied&quot; and was never able to do those long rolls either. He had <br/>
surgery to correct his tongue a couple of years ago--I&#39;ll have to ask <br/>
him if he can rrrrrrrroll now.<br/>
