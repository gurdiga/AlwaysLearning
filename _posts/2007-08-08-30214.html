<div id="ygrps-yiv-545050282">I&#39;m quoting an article; I&#39;ll cite and link it later.<br/>
<br/>
=======================================================================<br/>
<br/>
Platform games might as well have been programmed by music teachers -  <br/>
the structure is a wish list of practice techniques.<br/>
<br/>
1) Students are forced to repeat particular sections until they get  <br/>
them right. If the student forgets to jump over the sleeping turtle,  <br/>
and treads on it instead, they get sent back to the start of the  <br/>
section.<br/>
<br/>
=====================================================================<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Students&quot; (he&#39;s referring to the players of video games as  <br/>
&quot;students&quot;) are *NOT* &quot;forced&quot; to repeat any sections of any games.   <br/>
Some of the choose to do that.  Some choose to find a different game,  <br/>
or to set the remote control down and go ride bikes.  Some would LOVE  <br/>
to choose to repeat particular sections, but their parents or music  <br/>
teachers won&#39;t let them.<br/>
<br/>
To call them &quot;students&quot; and use the term &quot;force&quot; shows an extremely  <br/>
different view than I&#39;ve read about here and in other unschooling  <br/>
discussions for years.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The quote is from a generally lame article called &quot;Nintendo Practice&quot;  <br/>
that suggests that music teachers pretend their music is a fun video  <br/>
game.   I play piano; I&#39;ve played other instruments in formal  <br/>
situations, and this article did not impress me.  But if I were to  <br/>
believe that forcing kids to practice music was a desirable goal, it  <br/>
might give me hope.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not recommending the article or the eventually-named product (a  <br/>
book for music teachers, I think), but I did want to make the point  <br/>
that although he&#39;s praising gamers, he&#39;s missing a very large point.   <br/>
They aren&#39;t &quot;forced.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve always disliked those kind of games and generally avoid them, or <br/>
have someone else in my family do that particular part of the game for <br/>
me if I know it will get me where I want to be.  My older daughter and <br/>
my husband are both great at going back and starting over, my younger <br/>
daughter and I both really dislike it and prefer not playing at all <br/>
than going back over and over.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, when I was playing music a lot and came to a part that I <br/>
routinely messed up, I wouldn&#39;t ever go back to the beginning to play <br/>
it all again, until I had that part right first.  I found that going <br/>
back tended to make me get sloppy with the beginning all the way up <br/>
until the part the I needed to work on.  It was only after I had <br/>
sufficiently mastered the part that needed the work, that I was able to <br/>
play the piece well.<br/>
<br/>
Going to the beginning may work for some, but certainly not all.  So <br/>
again it&#39;s like school, trying to force one way on all the kids and <br/>
tell them that it&#39;s the way to go and if someone isn&#39;t getting it, it <br/>
must be the fault of the child, certainly not the system itself, <br/>
because all kids like video games right?</div>
