it&#39;s a difficult thing to grow, so you can&#39;t just use<br/>
a regular petri dish with agar (seaweed gelatin, which<br/>
is what is used to grow many types of bacteria). if<br/>
that monkey kidney tissue was contaminated with the<br/>
simian immunovirus, then those who received the test<br/>
polio vax would have been inoculated also with the<br/>
SIV... thus the theory.<br/>

but I think your explanation is much more fun, Sandra!<br/>
