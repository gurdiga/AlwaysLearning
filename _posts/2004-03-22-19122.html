<div id="ygrps-yiv-2107440966">Hi Kelly and Julie and Everyone<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still out here in the river swamp. Kelly you couldn&#39;t swim now, the alligators have found us. Sigh. Roy&#39;s CockerSpaniel is a wonderful little dog, he loves the water, but we have to keep him away from the river.  Thank you for all of the professional advice (nuetering, ears, etc.).<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t checked the unschoolilng.com message boards in a long time. Perhaps I should slide over there and see whats up. I have been learning about and addressing dyslexia and dycalculia  both of which it seems Roy has.  I had to get Roy officially tested $$$ in order to convince his Daddy that it was not disciplin that he needed. Sheesh. He felt it was my poor mothering skills that was making it so hard for Roy to read and do written math.  That opinion really hurt. But now that there is an &quot;official&quot; $$$  dx  my skills and opinions are vindicated.  Dunno if I can forgive him for doubting me, us, for so long. He doesn&#39;t feel it was wrong to doubt until there was this &quot;official&quot; $$$ proof.  Rrrrrr. One VERY good thing in the report was that we are doing what really is best for Roy.  He is much happier than I even thought he was. I thought he was VERY VERY lonely.  But  the doc only saw a little bit, and a lot of separation anxiety, and mostly a well adjusted (whats that?), bright,<br/>
 healthy,  happy boy  with dyslexia. <br/>
<br/>
Julie we came home one day and the goat and a turkey were just gone. Back around Thanksgiving. Somebody&#39;s feast, I suppose.<br/>
<br/>
As we are still socially isolated, I keep trying to interest Roy is martial arts as there is a fairly good school relatively nearby, but he doesn&#39;t want to. I keep comming back to the subject though. Dunno how to make it something he wants, as that is the only way it is a worthwhile effort. Do you have any suggestions? Except just wait?  Plenty of other things to do. Perhaps it just isn&#39;t for him. <br/>
<br/>
I made a fence in order to have an armadillo free zone for a shade garden. Those critters can really tear up a lot  of ground over night!!!  We hung homemade mobiles and wind chimes all through the woods last summer, but most are a bit worn now, and we took them down again. <br/>
<br/>
Roy has an entire wall of first place, and a few second place ribbons from the county fair from the last two years.  We found out about enetering the fair through your idea of RECESS, Julie, which we did for as long as there was an interest...2 months....I just wasn&#39;t ABEKA literate.  I suppose I am too much of an oddity on my side of the county.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I&#39;m gonna go mostly lurk some more. Thank you, Sandra for letting me stay on the list even though I haven&#39;t posted in a long time. <br/>

 <br/>
I just hate it that some people doubt us and only believe the professionals.  As far as I am concerned we are the professionals as far us our children are concerned.<br/>
 <br/>

Our children don&#39;t carry the baggage we do therefor they are faster <br/>
Its time we followed them<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Other than The Swamp, I don&#39;t know just where you live, Sharon, but you<br/>
might have a therapeutic horseback riding program in the vicinity.  We have<br/>
a number of dyslexic kids in the one I work for, and it really helps.<br/>
Besides following left/right directions during the lesson, riding itself<br/>
helps with sensory integration delays, builds confidence, and is a lot of<br/>
fun &lt;g&gt;  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why keep trying to get him interested?  I realize you are isolated but <br/>
perhaps it would serve him better to help him get what he&#39;s interested <br/>
in.  Invite others to a club or activity that is of interest maybe.  <br/>
Perhaps others on the list would have good ideas for you if the question <br/>
were framed differently.  That is, how can I help him share his <br/>
interests with others or find others who share his interests (assuming <br/>
he wants that).  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, I wouldn&#39;t try to get him interested.  How can you make somebody <br/>
want something that they don&#39;t?  Why would you want to?   At this point, <br/>
he surely knows it is an option.  And could ask for it if his interests <br/>
change. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Except just wait?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would say no.  Don&#39;t wait for him to get interested in a predefined <br/>
something.  Give that up!  But don&#39;t wait to help him get access to <br/>
something that he is interesested in.  Does that make sense?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Plenty of other things to do. Perhaps it just isn&#39;t for him. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Right! :-)  Hope this is helpful.<br/>

<br/>
Don&#39;t you just love county fairs?  My kids did real well this year too.  I<br/>
think it is a lot of fun and we even had some of the school-at-homers join<br/>
in this year.<br/>
<br/>
Recess didn&#39;t last long here either.  Seems like little Johnny&#39;s spelling<br/>
test is ALWAYS more important &lt;sigh&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
If you and Roy get bored, just head on over to Texas &lt;smile&gt;<br/>
