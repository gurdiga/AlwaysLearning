<div id="ygrps-yiv-1159090582">-=-told a couple people that called what we had done,<br/>
their reponse, &quot;why?&quot; &quot;couldnt you have gone to the store?&quot;.<br/>
What would have been the fun in that when you can make them from<br/>
scratch?-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
AH!  Well Jill Parmer and I were talking the other day about her  <br/>
knitting socks when socks are $1 a pair, and me learning and singing  <br/>
Renaissance madrigals and medieval carols when perfectly good  <br/>
recordings by professionals are easily available.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not reinventing the wheel, in those cases above, but it is kinda  <br/>
following a pattern and making one when one could have been purchased  <br/>
the same day for not much money, in every case.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, I&#39;ll tell ya, the one time I forget to make up a bed, one of my<br/>
cats will do something to my bed, like barf up a hairball, or use it as<br/>
a litter box.  My cats are really mean sometimes!  That is the real<br/>
reason I make up beds, for no other reason at all.  It&#39;s soooo much<br/>
easier to wash a blanket then a mattress!<br/>
<br/>
Half the reason for washing sheets around here, is for the making of the<br/>
bed, billowing out the sheet and playing underneath of it.  I even wait<br/>
to make it until the Margaux is ready to play with it.  She would be<br/>
really upset with me if she missed out on that!  Plus jumping on an<br/>
unmade bed is waaaaayyy more fun than with all those blankets and sheets<br/>
getting in the way!</div>

In the Spring, here, if beds aren&#39;t made and if a window&#39;s open (or  <br/>
in old houses, even if windows are closed) sand will get on the sheet  <br/>
and it&#39;s very uncomfortable.  It&#39;s not something most people have to  <br/>
think about, and we don&#39;t have to think about it when it&#39;s not  <br/>
sandstorm days.<br/>

Patrick made ring tones for my cell phone, placing the phone on his amp while <br/>
he played his guitar. <br/>
<br/>
Sarah likes baking cookies. A lot. My job is to make sure the ingredients are <br/>
available. :)<br/>
<br/>
Nearly every Halloween costume worn by the family in the last 25 years was <br/>
designed and constructed by me or by the wearers themselves. Sometimes we&#39;ve <br/>
sewn from scratch. Sometimes we&#39;ve remodeled other clothing. Often we&#39;ve done a <br/>
little of both.<br/>
<br/>
Homemade ice cream is possibly the best thing on the planet.<br/>
<br/>
Cards! I got a bought card from my oldest daughter for my last birthday. It <br/>
was sweet and thoughtful but I was just a little sad that it wasn&#39;t a hand <br/>
drawn hand lettered home made love like all the ones that had come before it.<br/>

Making breakfast,lunch or dinner, cards, presents and birthday cakes.<br/>

and light play of the water and sunlight-- thankyou both jenny c and<br/>
katherine for your pleasures from making beds! Ours are all on lofts<br/>
and some how it seems more a chore to me--maybe because of the<br/>
position Im in? I like your images Ill definitely be remembering you<br/>
both tomorrow :o)<br/>
<br/>
cloths, furniture, yarn(spinning)...even cloth (we weave)...<br/>
music<br/>
drums and flutes (dh makes and plays and teaches bansuri bamboo flutes<br/>
for a living)<br/>
<br/>
ds3matteo makes drop spindles and is working on a drum carder and a<br/>
spinning wheel..<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Last year we visited a chicken farm, brought home a dozen eggs, put <br/>
them in the incubator.  For 21 days we watched, turned, candled, and <br/>
monitored temperatures.  The kids made &quot;chicken books&quot; to track the <br/>
progress and on the 21st day we had a sleepover-Chicks night out- <br/>
with other homeschoolers, to watch them hatch and watch the movie <br/>
Chicken Run.  Now we have pet chickens.  <br/>
<br/>
A couple days later my husband said &quot;Why would you bother going <br/>
through all that when you could have just put them in school and <br/>
they could have read about it&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well I guess he&#39;s right?!?!  that would be easier wouldn&#39;t it???  <br/>
Maybe somebody should have told me sooner that I didn&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; do <br/>
it!!!<br/>

&gt; melissa<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Homemade pasta?  Wow that&#39;s daunting!  I did it once years ago, and it<br/>
was soooo much work!  Then again, I&#39;m not too into cooking, so it all<br/>
can seem like a chore sometimes.  Canning and preserving and baking, I<br/>
can do, and I LIKE to do.  Making bread and pizza dough, easy, I put it<br/>
in a machine.  Make my own dog food for our sweet doggie, easy, but<br/>
homemade pasta, that&#39;s hard.<br/>
<br/>
I guess it&#39;s all perspective eh?</div>
