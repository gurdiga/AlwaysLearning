<div id="ygrps-yiv-1189743545">Going into my local  group&#39;s newsletter.  Comments?<br/>
<br/>
Please avert your eyes - I&#39;m changing paradigms!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I collect quotes, because it fascinates me that human minds can get <br/>
such very deep and difficult ideas across so poignantly and <br/>
succinctly.  I have had life-changing &quot;AHA!&quot; moments inspired by <br/>
these snippets of mind, so I thought I would share a couple of quotes <br/>
I came across while collecting inspirational, pithy prose to share on <br/>
the SOS website, and some of my own thinking in response.<br/>
<br/>
  	Laura, from Texas, wrote this on an email list:  <br/>
		 &quot;One piece of advice I always give, and the thing <br/>
that often gets TOTALLY left out of &quot;what you need to get started&quot; is <br/>
that new homeschoolers should spend some time thinking about what <br/>
education, and &quot;being educated&quot; means to them. Where is it that <br/>
they&#39;re trying to go? What do they want to accomplish? What&#39;s <br/>
important to them about the process? What&#39;s important to their <br/>
children? What kind of life do they want to have together?. . . &quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I think my early formal education, and most probably that of most <br/>
Americans of my generation, had a pretty typical look to it:  without <br/>
having to think about it, my parents sent me to catch the big yellow <br/>
bus at the bottom of my street every morning before 9 am, from the <br/>
time I was five until I received my public high school diploma at age <br/>
18.    I was lucky enough to have been born with the temperament and <br/>
talent to fit into that world very easily.   As an early and avid <br/>
reader I did spend a LOT of time reading materials of my own choice <br/>
outside of school, but as a people-pleaser, I kept that stuff to <br/>
myself and  found most of my self-esteem in being &quot;smart&quot; in school - <br/>
ready, able and willing to take in and spit back whatever my teachers <br/>
required, pleased at the thought that I was what my mother expected <br/>
me to be:  smart and diligent,  bringing home A+ report cards on a <br/>
quarterly basis, for 13 years.   (Well, I&#39;ll admit there were quite a <br/>
few B&#39;s in the last couple of years, but that&#39;s a whole &#39;nother <br/>
story!) <br/>
               When senior year came and thoughts turned to &quot;my <br/>
future&quot; it went without saying that college was ahead,  though I <br/>
really had no particular career or direction in mind, and I just went <br/>
because it was expected - I was smart, and back then (aargh! has it <br/>
really been twenty+ years?!?!) smart people went to college.  It was <br/>
expected.   This was the path through  &quot;Good Education&quot;  and out the <br/>
other side to  &quot;Good Job.&quot;  <br/>
             College was quite a bit tougher to slide through than my <br/>
previous schooling had been;  I wasn&#39;t sure why at the time, but <br/>
since then I&#39;ve come to realize that I had chosen many classes where <br/>
I was required to do a lot of original thinking,  something I was  <br/>
hardly even ALLOWED to do before.  So here I finally tasted the inner <br/>
rewards of thinking outside the box, began to realize that all that <br/>
learning I had done by reading on my own was my REAL education, and <br/>
began to acknowledge that fitting in the box had so very little to do <br/>
with who I truly was and who I might possibly become.  <br/>
                I managed to squeak through and graduate with a BA in <br/>
art history -- which I loved, and love, but hardly guarantees a &quot;Good <br/>
Job&quot; manifesting itself!   I flailed, my dh flailed (his BA is in <br/>
Art!), together we flailed around trying to figure out what to do <br/>
with ourselves, til we made a baby, pretty much inadvertantly, and <br/>
my &quot;Good Job&quot; was forever redefined as &quot;mother.&quot;   My first-born, my <br/>
angel, my cattle-prod, my Larkin allowed for no speck more of in-the-<br/>
box thinking, or expectations, or living.   I now had another life, <br/>
another spirit I was wholly responsible for, and I would push myself <br/>
to be the  best at it that I could be, and that meant I needed to be <br/>
the best me I could be, and that meant a whole heck of a lot of <br/>
challenged expectations!   Lucky for me, whil I was still pregnant <br/>
with Larkin, I came across John Holt&#39;s books and after only a few <br/>
pages I found his ideas resonating deeply within me - I remember <br/>
thinking, I KNEW this, I KNEW this! He knew what my childhood looked <br/>
like, he knew about children, he knew how children learn and he knew <br/>
what it means to be &quot;educated&quot;.  <br/>
       	We became unschoolers at that point, saying to ourselves (and <br/>
anyone who would listen!) that we don&#39;t need school to learn, and <br/>
while adding three more young&#39;uns, have only gone further to the edge <br/>
of the &quot;unschooling spectrum&quot; as the years have gone by.   We live <br/>
our lives as if school didn&#39;t exist.  We&#39;ve become less and less <br/>
influenced by the typical, the expected, the schooled; and more and <br/>
more entranced with the joy, the beauty, the possibilities, of the <br/>
real, natural world.  Our education is not preparation for some <br/>
future &quot;real&quot; life, it IS our lives.  We learn because we can&#39;t NOT <br/>
learn.  We trust ourselves and each other to engage the world <br/>
joyfully, thoughtfully, respectfully, compassionately;  we trust <br/>
ourselves and each other to learn the world&#39;s &quot;lessons&quot; as they&#39;re <br/>
needed and as they come into our awareness.   We trust ourselves and <br/>
each other to be and become the self-made, self-aware, self-<br/>
actualized persons we were each born to be.   <br/>
	Those are my answers to Laura&#39;s poignant questions.  So far.  <br/>
Maybe I&#39;ll learn something next week or next year that will change my <br/>
mind.  Life is learning.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
Live long and prosper.<br/>
May the force be with you.<br/>
Namaste.<br/>
