<div id="ygrps-yiv-1054379594">Sorry to start a new topic, but I couldn&#39;t find the right spot to put  <br/>
this.  It&#39;s about the idea of &quot;starting late.&quot;  I&#39;ve put a new page  <br/>
and a new index page (with just a few links so far) here:<br/>

<br/>
The assumption of most unschooling discussions is that it&#39;s something  <br/>
parents do when they decide to pull a child or a family of children  <br/>
out of school.  I know I&#39;m an exception, having started before &quot;school  <br/>
age&quot; with many of the principles that became common in &quot;radical  <br/>
unschooling.&quot;  There&#39;s so much online now that someone can come by and  <br/>
think &quot;OH, I can do better than that...&quot; and declare herself  <br/>
retroactively to have been unschooling for four years, because her  <br/>
child is four and still not in school.<br/>
<br/>
Any person who takes ANY advice has a responsibility to be careful  <br/>
who&#39;s giving it and why.<br/>
<br/>
The vast majority of unschoolers whose kids are now teens started at  <br/>
some point after the child was five or six.  So the questions will be  <br/>
about the family&#39;s ability to change course, and to adapt to new  <br/>
ideas.   One parent cannot decide that unilaterally.  It needs to be  <br/>
carefully considered.   Then the balancing problem becomes how quickly  <br/>
and how much time for gradual change?<br/>
<br/>
There isn&#39;t a formula, past the deschooling formula which existed when  <br/>
I came around years ago, at one month per year of schooling (or  <br/>
schoolishness, the unschoolers added later, because if people go from  <br/>
school to school at home, that&#39;s not the kind of deschooling that  <br/>
unschooling needs).<br/>
<br/>
Some people seem to think unschooling is something the kids will do on  <br/>
their own if they&#39;re brought home, and the parents continue to live  <br/>
their own lives, and the kids are expected to &quot;direct their own  <br/>
education.&quot;  I&#39;ve never liked that term.  It sends people in the wrong  <br/>
direction.   It is &quot;getting cold,&quot; to think of &quot;child led&quot; whatever,  <br/>
or of children &quot;being in charge&quot; of their own learning.<br/>
<br/>
If parents are unwilling to attempt to become expert enough in how  <br/>
unschooling works to get it to work WELL at their own home, then they  <br/>
should really leave their kids in school.  Bringing kids out of school  <br/>
doesn&#39;t magically create an unschooling environment.   By &quot;expert  <br/>
enough&quot; I don&#39;t mean enough to charge other people money to advise  <br/>
them.  I mean expert in the sense that one can be a good unschooling  <br/>
parent even if awakened in the middle of the night, or on a day when  <br/>
the mom is sick, or the car doesn&#39;t run and you&#39;re low on groceries.<br/>
<br/>
When the parents get to the point that they ARE unschooling parents,  <br/>
that they know how to make decisions that will help unschooling  <br/>
thrive, then they can start to see the benefits.  As long as they&#39;re  <br/>
asking other people &quot;now what?&quot; they need to keep working on reading  <br/>
and asking and trying little bits and seeing what makes things  <br/>
better.  At some point, though, they should be able to do it without  <br/>
much hand-holding.<br/>
<br/>
This list exists to help people get to the point that they have  <br/>
confidence in their ability to make those kinds of little choices in  <br/>
the smallest of moments.<br/>
