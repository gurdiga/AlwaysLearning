<div id="ygrps-yiv-1921044005">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I have a request...my dh is driving back here to TN from Washington<br/>
state tomorrow. We just moved, so saving money is really important<br/>
right now, therefore I&#39;m trying to find unschool families he can stay<br/>
with overnight.<br/>
He&#39;s really laid back (a bit introverted at times) and easy going, so<br/>
not much bother.:)<br/>
His route is South on I-5 from the Portland area (to avoid all the bad<br/>
weather) then East on Hwy. 40. He&#39;ll be covered in Albuquerque<br/>
(Sandra?), but<br/>
I&#39;m trying to figure out somewhere near Medford or Redding, maybe<br/>
Bakersfield....places near I-5 and then somewhere off 40 in AZ<br/>
(perhaps near Flagstaff?).<br/>
<br/>
Would you write me if you&#39;re willing to put an unschooling Dad up for<br/>
a night?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much everyone!</div>
