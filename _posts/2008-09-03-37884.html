<div id="ygrps-yiv-2081370570">&quot;So the universe is not quite as you thought it was. You&#39;d better rearrange<br/>
your beliefs, then. Because you certainly can&#39;t rearrange the universe.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
From the novel Nightfall by Isaac Asimov and Robert Silverberg<br/>
<br/>
I saw this quote on another list, but thought it fit nicely with unschooling<br/>
and appreciating our kids for who they are.<br/>
