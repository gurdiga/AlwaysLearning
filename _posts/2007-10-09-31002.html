<div id="ygrps-yiv-254116014">Here&#39;s a sample of the writing of a 15 year old who never had any  <br/>
lessons at all in how to write, and who didn&#39;t read until she was 11  <br/>
(12 she said the other day, and she&#39;s usually right):<br/>

<br/>
That playlist is magnificent! thank you for creating it.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It won&#39;t be long&quot; is skippy between each chorus, and &quot;I&#39;ve just seen  <br/>
a face&quot; is only an 11 second recording. So those could be replaced,  <br/>
and I&#39;ll do it tomorrow, if you want.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really glad we saw that movie. THAT&#39;s the kind of movie that will  <br/>
make good birthday-gifts for years !<br/>
<br/>
Holly<br/>
=================================<br/>
<br/>
There are five or six minor changes I would recommend if she were  <br/>
going to publish it, but for casual e-mail it&#39;s... magnificent!<br/>
<br/>
The page to which she refers is one I started last night and will  <br/>
continue to add to here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/acrosstheuniverse">http://sandradodd.com/acrosstheuniverse</a><br/>
<br/>
There were only three songs that Project Playlist didn&#39;t have at all.<br/>
<br/>
Holly and I saw &quot;Across the Universe&quot; Sunday afternoon.  It&#39;s still  <br/>
not in full release, but will be next week.  It&#39;s an art film in the  <br/>
finest sense, and it&#39;s a musical but not in the classic way, and it&#39;s  <br/>
a period drama with good attention to physicalities, and the  <br/>
characters are either likable or trippy or both.  It&#39;s a picture of a  <br/>
slice of the 60&#39;s showing a connectedness between the U.K. and the  <br/>
U.S. (or probably more like the suggestion that the same thoughts  <br/>
were being thought in the whole English speaking world).<br/>
<br/>
There are some pieces of art my kids have had as desktops or  <br/>
screensavers--paintings that show names of bands, in pictures, or  <br/>
movie titles. They&#39;re very intricate puzzles, kind of--&quot;find the  <br/>
picture&quot; but much more.   This is a little like that.  In any moment,  <br/>
in the film, there might be reference to several things, in what&#39;s  <br/>
shown, the music that&#39;s played and the way it&#39;s done, and musically  <br/>
there&#39;s something wonderful about it too, in the concept.<br/>
<br/>
Younger kids probably would have no interest because it&#39;s hard to  <br/>
follow, though on DVD at home it wouldn&#39;t be so bad, because they  <br/>
could come for whatever they thought were the good parts and ignore  <br/>
the rest.  Those my age who have Viet Nam sensitivities might want to  <br/>
wait for DVD too.  It&#39;s not too bad, but some who&#39;ve had loved ones  <br/>
in  in stupid wars might be warned.<br/>
<br/>
Dance!  There are some choreographed large-group dance moments, and  <br/>
Holly was able to name off references to choreography in other movie  <br/>
musicals, so those will be fun for those with that knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
My biggest concern is that now some people will have heard Beatles  <br/>
songs in cover before hearing the originals, but that&#39;s already  <br/>
happening from things like the Cirque de Soleil musical and the Black  <br/>
and White album.  But never hearing the originals at all would be  <br/>
rough.  &quot;Hold Me Tight&quot; wasn&#39;t available on Playlist, but I have Meet  <br/>
the Beatles on vinyl (both my original 60&#39;s copy and a replacement I  <br/>
bought in the 70&#39;s because the first was so worn), so I was able to  <br/>
play it for Holly in moments.  Not every mom has all the Beatles  <br/>
albums along with the memory of buying them new.<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to use and share that page.  It won&#39;t be a permanent thing,  <br/>
because Project Playist is a fluxxy deal.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1680043603">We saw Across the Universe when it was released here on September  <br/>
14th. I couldn&#39;t figure out why it wasn&#39;t being talked about  <br/>
EVERYWHERE - it is so wonderful - enjoyable on so many levels and so  <br/>
much food for thought and conversation! I didn&#39;t realize it had had  <br/>
such a small release - only 27 theaters in the whole country on 9/14.  <br/>
So, when I read Sandra&#39;s post, I wondered about the release schedule  <br/>
and I looked it up.<br/>
<br/>
********The film received its world premiere on Monday September 10,  <br/>
2007 at the Toronto Film Festival. The film was then given a very  <br/>
limited &quot;platform release&quot; on 27 screens in the US on Friday  <br/>
September 14. The film had the second-highest &quot;per-screen&quot; average on  <br/>
its opening weekend. In the following weeks, the release was  <br/>
expanded, with the second week of release expanding to 276 locations  <br/>
in select regions. [3]. The film is scheduled to go into broad  <br/>
general release in the U.S. on October 12.[6]********<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve seen it multiple times - will be first in line to buy the DVD  <br/>
when it comes out, and we&#39;ve been listening to the soundtrack of the  <br/>
movie AND to the original Beatles&#39; songs, over and over and over. I  <br/>
am surprised at how much I like the covers of the original songs -  <br/>
I&#39;d have thought I&#39;d have been a Beatles purist &lt;G&gt; but they do a  <br/>
really good job on the songs in the movie and I am enjoying listening  <br/>
to them. A lot.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really taken by the movie - it so perfectly captured the tone of  <br/>
the times - in a very artistic sense. It all seemed to me to evoke  <br/>
exactly the way the world sort of &quot;felt&quot; to me in those days. These  <br/>
were my high school years.<br/>
<br/>
This has been my favorite year for movies in a long time -  <br/>
&quot;Stardust,&quot; &quot;Hairspray,&quot; and now &quot;Across the Universe&quot; - three great  <br/>
movies one right after another! Groovy! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Yes.  Beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just going to pre-order the DVD from Amazon when we can so I  <br/>
won&#39;t have to think about it.  It would be  kind of cool to have it  <br/>
on a big TV as a piece of wall art, just playing over and over.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never seen a movie do that three-level release before.  We tried  <br/>
to find it in northern Minnesota but no luck.  I thought maybe it was  <br/>
already gone, but it hasn&#39;t gotten there.  It&#39;s on two screens at the  <br/>
same theater in Albuquerque, and it&#39;s expensive (relatively), $19 for  <br/>
two of us for a matinee.  Holly wants to wait until it&#39;s less  <br/>
expensive to go back.  Maybe the 14th in an afternoon matinee at a  <br/>
cheaper theater.  I&#39;ve been ready to go back since the credits  <br/>
started when I saw it the first time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1749780431">Wow! I haven&#39;t even watched the movie yet and already I love it - from<br/>
viewing the trailers and listening to the soundtrack I&#39;m wowed - the<br/>
cinematography is great and the music is *excellent*. It sounds and<br/>
looks fascinating! I saw a snippet of a trailer about this a few<br/>
months ago and it caught my eye but didn&#39;t get the name of the movie.<br/>
How awesome to get this message - now I know what it is! I&#39;ve hunted<br/>
down a theater about an hour away that is  showing it this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
I was reading the production notes and other stuff on the site and I&#39;m<br/>
amazed by how much creative artistry and intelligent storytelling has<br/>
been put into this movie. Also, I found a few things that really<br/>
tickled me: The director is the same person who did Frida, which is<br/>
one of my all-time favorite movies. There are cameos by several people<br/>
including Eddie Izzard, whom I adore. And the musician who plays Jo-Jo<br/>
found found his sound by listening to (and later playing with)<br/>
Parliament Funkadelic, which is really high up there on my list of<br/>
incredible music.<br/>
