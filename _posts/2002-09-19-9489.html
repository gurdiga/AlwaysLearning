<div id="ygrps-yiv-651516632">Can I rant here breifly amongst friends who won&#39;t think I&#39;m crazy??<br/>
<br/>
I was at my sisters today and my 7yo first grade public schooled <br/>
nephew came home.  My sister in law who is neither his mother or in <br/>
anyway in charge of him (I was babysitting) demanded that he come <br/>
inside immidiatly and do his homework.  He didn&#39;t want to (hates <br/>
school, hides his homework to avoid doing it).  So she told him if he <br/>
didn&#39;t she would call his mom and tell her and that he would be <br/>
grounded and not be able to go to the school skating party tomorrow.  <br/>
He went to his room to get away from her (I would have too)  She <br/>
followed him and ragged on him them went and got into her backpack <br/>
and dragged out his homework and took it to him.  When my sister came <br/>
home SIL ran out to tell her the punishment she had already set up <br/>
and my sis went along with it.<br/>
<br/>
All afternoon his parents halfheartedly demand that he go sit down <br/>
and do his homework or else he won&#39;t be able to go.  This drags on <br/>
for more than an hour.  Finally I&#39;m tired of it so I finally offer to <br/>
sit down with him and help him through it.<br/>
<br/>
First was spelling/vocab.  He has 12 words he&#39;s supposed to write <br/>
them into sentences.  I help him come up with sentences.  He has no <br/>
problems with the words or sentence structure just has a really hard <br/>
time deciding on a sentence.  he gets very frustrated several times <br/>
and screams that he hates it.  I tell him I understand.  That it&#39;s <br/>
tedious and boring.  As a break we go onto the math homework.  he <br/>
quicky works the 5 or 6 double diget subtraction problems no prob.  <br/>
Then there is the &#39;story problem&#39;.  I&#39;ve helped him with these <br/>
before.  They suck!!  Just going through them makes it very obvious <br/>
why kids are so afraid of math...<br/>
<br/>
John picked some apples.  His mother gave him 5 apples.  Now he has <br/>
nine apples.  How many apples did John pick?<br/>
<br/>
Simple.  4, and my nephew knew that right off no problem.  The catch <br/>
here is they have to tell them how they know.  The paper looks like <br/>
this...<br/>
<br/>
Thought___________<br/>
Information_________<br/>
Method____________<br/>
Solution____________<br/>
<br/>
None of this is clear to me as an adult.  I had no idea what they <br/>
could possible want in these spaces.  Apparently it goes like this.  <br/>
Thought is the opperation.  he chose + which seems appropriate if you <br/>
read the problem because no one is taking anything away they are <br/>
adding.  For &#39;Info&#39; they put in the numbers.  His were 5 and 9.  <br/>
Method they are supposed to write the problem.  So he wrote 5+9.  <br/>
Then In solution they write the problem and the answer.  5+9=4.  <br/>
Obviously this is not right.  My option here is to either point this <br/>
out or let the teacher point it out.  Either way someone is pointing <br/>
out he&#39;s wrong.  When in fact the problem is just worded horribly for <br/>
a 7 yo.  So I asked him &quot;is 5+9 4?  He says no 5+9=14.  So he decides <br/>
the answer must be 14.  At this point he&#39;s so far from the original <br/>
question that this seems correct.  So I showed him how to plug 14 <br/>
back in to see if it was the right answer and he immidiatly saw that <br/>
it wasn&#39;t.  So then he screams some more and throws the paper and is <br/>
mad at the world.<br/>
<br/>
No wonder they think it&#39;s hard.  They took a perfectly logical easy <br/>
question that he could do in his head and made it so hard that he <br/>
came up with two wrong answers and got so frustrated he &#39;wouldn&#39;t&#39; do <br/>
it.  The fact is the &#39;easiest&#39; way to solve this problem is X+5=9.  I <br/>
pointed this out to my sister and she actually wrote a note to the <br/>
teacher on the homework paper asking why her 7yo is expected to know, <br/>
understand, and explain algebra.  She hates the school and the <br/>
teacher.  I wish she would wake up and just pull him out.  He threw a <br/>
fan across the living room the otherday because the teacher called <br/>
him Sidney-poo in front of the whole class.  Last year they had him <br/>
in remidial reading because he didn&#39;t like to read in front of <br/>
everyone (oh and in remidial reading he had to read in front of <br/>
everyone which only made things worse)  It&#39;s sad to see the schools <br/>
crushing this creative, once happy kid.<br/>
<br/>
*sigh*<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for bearing with me through this.  I needed to vent.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1163034846">i feel so bad for this kid and all the other kids in this situation....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
a few homeschooling friend&#39;s children tried school this year.  none of <br/>
them stayed more than a week.  lexie says she wants nothing to do with <br/>
it.  good for her.  however, she has asked me to teach her long <br/>
division.  ok...  what ever you wish. so i found  mathbook and we will <br/>
work towards long division.  she doesn&#39;t want to learn subtraction with <br/>
carrying and doesn&#39;t understand why she has to do that first, so i tried <br/>
to explain it.  i think she understood and is keen to get started so we <br/>
did the chapter test at the end of the first chapter and she got them <br/>
all right.  so now we move on to chapter two.  we aren&#39;t going to do <br/>
every page, but just do the test at the end to see what things in that <br/>
chapter she needs to know, and then go back and do that and then go <br/>
forward.  it&#39;ll be interesting...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-426078736">I used to go out to dinner on a regular basis with 3 other women.  Our<br/>
kids had known each other since they were 1 and had grown up together.<br/>
When they all hit 5 I was the only one unschooling.  When we would go<br/>
out to dinner we would be in a restaurant for 3 hours and I would sit<br/>
and listen to these women complain about teachers, homework, the school<br/>
district, clothing, bullies, homework, homework, homework...  I once<br/>
even said &quot;if you don&#39;t like all these things about school why are you<br/>
sending them&quot;... 2 of these people were teachers and so they looked at<br/>
me in horror as to what else they could do....<br/>
<br/>
I never had any intention of Zak doing homework regardless of whether he<br/>
went to school or not.  I remember being in school in England and in the<br/>
5th year (which translates to age 16 here, not sure what Grade that is<br/>
because as I unschool I&#39;ve never bothered to learn what grades meant) I<br/>
decided that it was a waste of time to do homework.  I went from a<br/>
student that got A&#39;s and B&#39;s to D&#39;s and E&#39;s just because I wouldn&#39;t do<br/>
any homework and my parents didn&#39;t make me..  <br/>
<br/>
I think of homework as more busywork except instead of doing it at<br/>
school, you are bringing that busywork home now and invading that safe<br/>
place.<br/>
<br/>
Zak loves Math problems for about 1 hour and then he&#39;s bored and wants<br/>
to play....Right now his favorite show is Stanley on Disney as they are<br/>
doing the alphabet of animals and he loves things in sequence.<br/>
