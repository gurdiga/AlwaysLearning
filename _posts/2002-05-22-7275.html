SO many of these things happen.  I love these stories.<br/>

And just think... if the conversation had gone otherwise you might not have <br/>
come to that revelation.  If it had gone longer you might have had a second <br/>
connection!<br/>
<br/>
I wonder how many meetings are with people who are connected somehow but the <br/>

In my local park, A woman came up to me and asked me if I had <br/>
been to England recently (I had a Virgin Kids Bag with snacks in <br/>
it).  I told her that we&#39;d moved from there a year and a half ago.  It <br/>
turns out that her and family moved here last year from England.  <br/>
They lived about an hour away from where we did and her <br/>
husband was born and raised where we lived in London for 4 <br/>
years.  She was born and raised in Lafayette, CA (just across the <br/>
bay from where I was born and raised).  She has 2 daughters <br/>
aged 6 and 8 (Tamzin is 7).  Oldest was born here and they <br/>
moved to England when she was a year old.  Second one was <br/>
born in England.  Needless to say, we have all become good <br/>
friends.  After all, we have so much in common!  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I met my husband when he was hired to wait tables at my family&#39;s restaurant.<br/>
<br/>
When we were planning the wedding, my mother&#39;s college suite-mate asked to <br/>
host a shower. Ends up, her sister was a VERY good friend of my future <br/>
mother-in-law, and I used to be great friends with the sister&#39;s daughter. Her <br/>
son swam with my husband-to-be on the swim team. We had the shower---and we <br/>
ALL knew each other and knew all the same stories. We all even had pictures <br/>
of each other, but didn&#39;t know all the names.<br/>
<br/>
Years later, Ben and I were talking about Gaffney (the town). Seems that we <br/>
were both there during a big snow storm and played together while visiting a <br/>
boy named Charlie Brown (that&#39;s how we KNEW we&#39;d met before---at Charlie <br/>
Brown&#39;s).<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve come across many of these connections throughout our lives---but we <br/>
didn&#39;t know of them until we were married. I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll still find a few <br/>
more.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-193689977">OK, maybe it&#39;s not *that* odd, since Oklahoma&#39;s a small state, but I met dh<br/>
in Dallas, eight years after my freshman year in college. We realized we&#39;d<br/>
been in college band together, and after we married, were looking at my<br/>
parents&#39; family scrapbook, and there in a photo of my brother&#39;s college jazz<br/>
band, was dh on drums.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1574125738">I live in South Carolina. One of my daughters moved across the <br/>
country to Portland, Oregon a year ago. Within her first two days <br/>
there she met a boy who told her his grandfather was from South <br/>
Carolina and asked her did she know the town of Walterboro? Well I <br/>
grew up in Walterboro and my brother still lives there. Turns out the <br/>
boy&#39;s grandfather was a fellow my brother knows well and who he sees <br/>
almost every day when he&#39;s out running. Pretty big coincidence <br/>
there...small SC town and big Oregon city and these two kids meet up. <br/>
Then a couple of months ago I was at my brother&#39;s house (formerly my <br/>
mother&#39;s house)finally sorting through her things (she died a couple <br/>
of years ago). We were cleaning out some very old papers in a <br/>
secretary desk she had. These papers were from the 1860s and 70s and <br/>
I didn&#39;t recognize the names on them at all. I asked my brother about <br/>
them. Turns out the desk had belonged to the Oregon boy&#39;s great great <br/>
great grandfather who&#39;d moved to the south during reconstruction. <br/>
Somehow that desk needs to move to Oregon I think!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-678742341">These things are so strange and makes you realize what a small world it is.<br/>
<br/>
We hired a new nutrition prof here and before I&#39;d met her everyone said she<br/>
looked just like me. Well we laughed at meeting because we do look alike<br/>
however it turns out that she and I were born and went to the same school<br/>
in a little town in England, Scarborough. We know some of the same people<br/>
even. However I don&#39;t think our parents know each other:)<br/>
<br/>
And it turned out that my neighbor (and mom to my kid&#39;s best friend) and I<br/>
went to high school together in Germany. She met her husband in college in<br/>
the US -- he&#39;s Libyan and they have moved all over the place as we have. So<br/>
it&#39;s really strange to meet up with these people in the Middle East!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1935047772">My dh&#39;s only &quot;other&quot; significant other is married to one of my many <br/>
previous &quot;significant others&quot;.  They were married after we were, shortly <br/>
after she was jilted by my dh.  I believe she intended on marrying my ex <br/>
only after she found out he was in love with me at one time, because of <br/>
some weird fascination with me and/or Charles.  I wasn&#39;t so vain as to <br/>
think that until she saw my youngest son at a family wedding when she <br/>
was 5 months pregnant, and then proceeded to name her newborn son the <br/>
exact same name as ours (no ordinary name either, Clark William).  <br/>
<br/>
Now that&#39;s an &quot;odd&quot; connection.  :P  She gives me the creeps.<br/>

<br/>
Do you live far from one another???<br/>
<br/>
(That *is* creepy.)<br/>
<br/>
We have a creepy, repulsive, sexy, horrible friend.  I say &quot;sexy&quot; because <br/>
once a bunch of us were younger and all childless, we were playing a game on <br/>
a long van-ride, naming who we would want to bonk if the world were to be <br/>
ending in a week, and so there were no social, medical, reproductive, or <br/>
legal repercussions...<br/>
<br/>
Two of the women named this guy.  The other men were appalled and stunned.  <br/>
In days and weeks after when that story was told all the male people would <br/>
say *GEORGE*?! (only they&#39;d say his actual name, which is so unusual that if <br/>
I name it we&#39;ll have an odd connection moment with someone ELSE here &lt;g&gt;).    <br/>
But females would nod and say &quot;Yep.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well anyway, the story:  He had two women pregnant at the same time in the <br/>
1970&#39;s.  They had their babies within a month of one another and each named <br/>
the boy the same name (the daddy&#39;s favorite pick for a boy-name, and they <br/>
both turned out to be boys...).  Slime.  Unfortunately and mysteriously, <br/>
sometimes slime has charisma.<br/>

it was 3 women. The baby boys all carried HIS first<br/>
and last name.  He was working becuase he had been<br/>
sued by all three and it was jail or work. <br/>
