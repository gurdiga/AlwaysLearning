 </span></blockquote>In another post, you said your hubby was soon to become the hs&#39;ing parent.  <br/>
That in itself will provide an interesting wrinkle.  My dh sounded alot like <br/>
yours when ds was 10.  My *devil teacher* had been coming out alot to <br/>
tyrannize, and ds, after much mutual soul-searching and a some mutual tears, <br/>
informed me that I was fired as his teacher.  (His exact words were [albeit <br/>
said tenderly], &quot;I need a mother right now more than I need a teacher, and <br/>
you&#39;re just not very good at changing hats.&quot;  Out of the mouths of babes...)  <br/>
Well, I wasn&#39;t about to let him get away with firing me -- ! -- so I quit the <br/>
job.<br/>
<br/>
Enter dh, who decided that *he* would take over, because after all, those <br/>
3R&#39;s had to be mastered.  That lasted exactly 6 weeks.  (Dh got fired, too.)  <br/>
After that, ds took over responsibility for his own education and unschooling <br/>
began in earnest.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; he is concerned that they will need exams and must have the<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A few things you might share with your husband:  Kids aready know how to <br/>
learn (they&#39;ve  been doing it all their lives).  Yes, my son did learn how to <br/>
take tests.  And yes, he did get into the college of his choice, where he is <br/>
happily following his interests.  It all works out.<br/>
