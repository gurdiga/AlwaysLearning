<div id="ygrps-yiv-71183635">I&#39;d love some thoughts on a situation that we&#39;re going through at the <br/>
moment. Lewi, my son, is 7. He&#39;s always been quite volatile emotionally and <br/>
very expressive when it comes to his emotions - particular the angry ones. <br/>
When he has playdates with only one other child there seems to be very <br/>
little difficulty. He seems to rarely get angry and hardly ever not gets to <br/>
an overwhelmed state. If an issue does arise both children seem to be able <br/>
to problem solve mostly on their own and work through things smoothly <br/>
together.<br/>
<br/>
However, whenever we play with more than one child - bet it a friend with <br/>
his/her siblings or our unschooling groups with quite arange of children he <br/>
tends to be dominant and bossy and is quick to get angry when things aren&#39;t <br/>
going his way both with me and with the other children. He can really get <br/>
quite angry and &#39;in your face&#39; and it can be really intimidating for others <br/>
around us (and me too).<br/>
<br/>
I feel like I&#39;ve gone through abit of a parenting slump (very unfortunately) <br/>
and got into some negative parenting (probably really disconnecting at those <br/>
times rather than connecting due to my lack of ability to handle his <br/>
emotions at the moment in public). I feel like I&#39;m back to my old self much <br/>
more again but I feel like I need some extra help in working out what to do <br/>
to help Lewi in these situations as well as keeping everyone else around us <br/>
feeling OK and safe.<br/>
<br/>
I love Naomi Aldort&#39;s book and use validation alot although I&#39;ve felt, in my <br/>
parenting &#39;slump&#39; that it was no way near enough for those really tense <br/>
situations and I&#39;d forgotten some of the other strategies I&#39;d used in the <br/>
past. On re-reading Connection Parenting and some of the Non Violent <br/>
Communication and PET I have got back into stating things from a needs point <br/>
of view eg: When I see you yell at ....I feel worried because I have a need <br/>
for everyone to feel safe. etc. That sort of thing. As well as the usual <br/>
validating etc. The thing is I&#39;ve felt so concerned about other people&#39;s <br/>
children that I&#39;d become abit controling in my approach and expectations <br/>
when Lew got angry. This certainly did not help and only caused <br/>
disconnection between us.<br/>
<br/>
I feel that having plays in a one on one situation would be good for the <br/>
time being but he really enjoys getting together with our unschooling groups <br/>
and families with more than one child. I&#39;ve been talking with two families <br/>
about strategies etc we can use. I&#39;m just not sure whether I should put Lew <br/>
into those situations again so soon.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love some help to work through some of this as I&#39;m finding it really <br/>
stressful and I know Lewi must be too (although he always comes away from <br/>
situations when he&#39;s been angry and upset at someone/me with happy thoughts <br/>
and a feeling of having fun). I just want to remain connected and not feel <br/>
cranky and irritated myself which I think was a pattern I was getting into <br/>
(which sickened me about myself).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much in advance.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What has helped most with Ray over the years has been to have one <br/>
adult committed to helping him navigate groups. Often that has been <br/>
me or my partner, but now and then another adult friend will step <br/>
up. If Ray has *one* person he can engage with one-on-one at a <br/>
moment&#39;s notice he&#39;s less likely to get angry and confrontational in <br/>
a group setting. <br/>
<br/>
As he&#39;s gotten older, I notice he does this more on his own - he <br/>
finds an adult friend to hang with and uses that friend as a <br/>
resource. At the skatepark, for example, he&#39;s gotten friendly with a <br/>
couple of the adult skaters and checks in with them if there&#39;s a <br/>
problem, like some other kid being rude about using the space. <br/>
Nowadays he usually only needs a brief interaction: &quot;hey, is it just <br/>
me, or is that guy being a total jerk?&quot; and then he can go back to <br/>
whatever he was doing, without needing to try to take control of the <br/>
situation.<br/>
