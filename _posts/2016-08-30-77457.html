<div id="ygrps-yiv-83592553">Hello All, in the past year my ten year old son, who has always been thin and wiry, has begun to bulk up. I figured this is normal at this stage of development, but now I notice that he has some cellulite on his chest. I haven&#39;t mentioned it to him and he hasn&#39;t noticed it himself, but I am becoming concerned because I understand cellulite is not reversible and I don&#39;t want him to be self conscious about it. But on the other hand, if I can help him avoid developing any more of it, I think I should do so. The thing is, he really loves processed foods like chips and Lunchables and once a month I take him to McDonald&#39;s because he loves it so much. I don&#39;t monitor his food and have never worried about it before but now I feel like I should do something, but I don&#39;t know how to go about it. I don&#39;t want to make an issue of it so that he feels self conscious and unattractive, but I want to help him avoid future frustration with his appearance as well.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Would be grateful for any advice, both in terms of how to approach the subject with my son and also, if he wants to make a change, how to help someone who loves lots of fat and sugar to transition to a lighter way of eating--or will that make a difference? He is not even chubby, just bulking compared to the wiry, thin way he used to be. I was really surprised by the cellulite, have never seen that on a kid before. He does also get lots of healthy food, just really prefers the processed versions of things. I think the bulking will even out as he grows, although in the past year he&#39;s become much more sedentary while he is gaming and watching Youtube videos. He takes breaks and jumps on the trampoline a lot, which helps. It&#39;s the cellulite that concerns me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any advice,  Robin</div>

<div>Hi Robin</div>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1157196431AppleMailSignature"><br>
</div>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1157196431AppleMailSignature">My son is 25 now. He was a wiry child, very straight up and down with London thin limbs. Always liked food and ate quite well and liked processed food alongside fresh. When he was around ten he started to get a layer of fat, especially
 round his middle, but I noticed a pattern that it happened then he grew then he got fatter, then he grew upwards again. He didn&#39;t have cellulite that I noticed but his cousin did the same and I remember he was larger round the chest area. I&#39;m not sure I would
 have called it cellulite but fat does sometimes look a bit dimpled on children in my experience, especially for example on their belly when they sit down, I have definitely seen that before. He went through the forever eating stage, It did concern me a bit
 but I used to leave big jars of dried fruit and nuts on the side so it was easy for him to help himself to those rather than go in the cupboard for other things. He also used to eat loads of bread and cereal but was fairly active as he grew so I&#39;m guessing
 he needed the carbs for growth as well as activity. Anyway my point was going to be to say that despite needing 36&quot; waist trousers at 14 once he reached his Adult height of 6&#39;4&quot; at about 16 he was back to the wiry frame with long thin limbs of his childhood.
 He finds it hard to put weight on now despite weight training. His cousin wasn&#39;t as wiry as him as a child and isn&#39;t as wiry as an adult but is definitely a normal size with no fat on his chest. It seems from these two that maybe the body needs to sometimes
 lay down some fat to prepare for what is to come!</div>

<br/>
I don&#39;t believe that to be true. Cellulite is when stored fat pushes through collagen fibers, or connective tissue, under the skin to form &#39;dimples&#39;. When a child grows, particularly from boy to man, and shoots up, develops more muscle, and produces more testosterone (which encourages building of muscle) I would imagine the cellulite could certainly lessen, if not go completely.<br/>
<br/>
==The thing is, he really loves processed foods like chips and Lunchables and once a month I take him to McDonald&#39;s because he loves it so much. ==<br/>
<br/>
You have no evidence his diet is causing cellulite.  Cellulite is known to be strongly genetic..Perhaps his Dad, or Granddad had cellulite at some point? The genetic factor is likely to do with how strong, and the orientation under the skin, he connective tissue is..<br/>
<br/>
I saw a study that said up to 10 - 20 % of boys and men have cellulite at some point. He&#39;s 10 - many boys bulk up as tweens, and then shoot up into bean poles as teens. My own son is also 10 and has bulked up a lot in the past year or so, also not chubby, but definitely chunkier than previously.<br/>
<br/>
==Would be grateful for any advice, both in terms of how to approach the subject with my son==<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t mention it at all to your son. You already said he&#39;s not chubby. He&#39;s doing what most boys do as tweens - bulking up.  If he&#39;s got cellulite, it&#39;s most likely temporary, and partly genetic, and more to do with the underlying structure of his fat cells and connective tissues than anything he is doing/eating/not doing. Even super skinny kids and adults get cellulite.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
==Although in the past year he&#39;s become much more sedentary while he is gaming and watching Youtube videos. ==<br/>
<br/>
Again - it&#39;s likely his age. Tweens, particularly boys, hunker down at home around that age - mine is doing the same.<br/>
<br/>
==It&#39;s the cellulite that concerns me.==<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t be concerned. Many kids develop cellulite. I would go read up on some (good, sound, scientific) articles on what cellulite actually is [😊]<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1102886028">Thanks so much for the responses. I am not worried about his weight, I was concerned about the cellulite. Actually, I don&#39;t care that he has it, I guess what I was really concerned about is that some time down the road he would notice it and be bummed about it. And I wondered if or how to keep that from happening.&nbsp;<span style="word-spacing:normal;">He doesn&#39;t notice it at all now and I&#39;d rather keep it that way, but a nagging voice whispered that it was some kind of neglect not to address it. I appreciate the suggestion to read more scholarly articles on the subject. What I read before posting left me feeling in a panic, I feel much calmer now and clear about leaving it alone. I will also read the weight articles Sandra linked to. The issue for me isn&#39;t his weight, but I would imagine the same principles apply. I always deeply appreciate reading the experiences of others that help me come back around to a good feeling place.</span></div>

<br/>
Control isn’t abundance.<br/>
An abundance of control is oppression.<br/>

<br/>
-=-There is a dinstinction between highly processed foods and other, notably whole, foods. -=-<br/>
There are MANY distinctions people make among foods, and most do more harm than good.<br/>
<br/>
-=-... a host of disease processes, which we are seeing in alarming numbers in children in the US…-=-<br/>
<br/>
Among unschooled kids with lots of choices?  Let’s just talk about unschooling here, and not all kinds of other things.<br/>
<br/>
-=- If one were starving, processed food could maintain some basic body functions, but a person would not regain vitality and full health - there are simply not enough nutrients, and the nutrients there are not balanced in the way the body needs them. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I’ve never known an unschooling child to be starving.  I have never heard of any family limiting a child to “processed food.”  The term, as you probably know, is very broad and is used in this context as a villifier more than as a descriptor.<br/>
<br/>
-=-If I were to make a scale of foods that support health and foods that degrade health, processed foods and meals from fast foods restaurants tip the scale towards foods that degrade health. Having the idea that it doesn&#39;t matter what you eat, regardless of the reasons for eating said food, is akin to saying it doesn&#39;t matter what I put in my car&#39;s gas tank: apple juice, coke, water, gasoline, diesel, dish soap; whatever I feel like feeding my car is fine, no worries. -=-<br/>
<br/>
No, it is not the same as that.<br/>
<br/>
Food, coke, water, can go into a human tank.<br/>
No one is recommending feeding a child gasoline, diesel or dish soap, so the example is facetious.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Providing an abundance of fast food now could mean problems down the road. How does learning about good health habits fit here from an unschooling perspective? I don&#39;t mean dictating food choices as each person&#39;s body is different and one person&#39;s poison is another person&#39;s medicine, but the idea that processed foods have less nutrient density is not a controversial one. -=-<br/>
<br/>
No one is force-feeding a child.   It’s not about poison, and it’s not about medicine.  It’s not about “nutrient density.”  It’s about living openly in the world and in the culture in which one finds himself, preferably without fear or fright.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I&#39;m vehemently opposed to shaming people into any food choices, but providing basic information about the potential cause and effect seems like good practice. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Your entire post seems intended to hint that some of us have NO IDEA of the vast knowledge you have—that we’re clueless.<br/>
<br/>
-=-However, to say what a person eats doesn&#39;t affect their body composition seems irresponsible to me.<br/>
<br/>
I don’t think anyone wrote that, and I’m pretty sure no one thought that except you. <br/>
To misrepresent this discussion, and to misrepresent food, shows more fear than calm.  <br/>
Fear and strong emotion is worse for health than just about ANY food, but millions of people have become frightened of foods all around them.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Am I missing something here?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  All of this:<br/>

The collected unschooling stories of over twenty years, you’re disregarding, or haven’t read.<br/>
Mainstream fears are available all around us, but the experiences of unschoolers are harder to come by. I would really like to keep this group’s focus on what unschoolers have done and learned, known and experienced, rather than what mainstream food fears are.  Those ebb and flow and change over the years.  The knowledge of what happens when choices are offered calmly and happily is a more specialized and rare thing.  <br/>
<br/>
There was a great deal of negativity in your last paragraph.  Do you think that your family members will NOT feel shamed by your statements?<br/>
<br/>
-=-My family doesn&#39;t generally visit fast food restaurants unless we&#39;re traveling, and I bring my own snacks so I don&#39;t have to eat fast food. It makes me feel awful. Given the choice between fast food and no food I&#39;ll take no food, with the knowledge I can get better-for-me food later. That&#39;s me. My daughter and husband will get their burgers and fries and when my daughter used to ask why I wasn&#39;t getting anything I simply said it doesn&#39;t make me feel good. I&#39;m vehemently opposed to shaming people into any food choices, but providing basic information about the potential cause and effect seems like good practice. I don&#39;t buy much in the way of processed foods, and we have fun experimenting in the kitchen making our own snacks and treats with foods *I* feel good about (knowing the science behind the damage to the gut biome caused by GMOs - which affect digestive function, immune health, and neurological functioning and therefore learning - I don&#39;t feel good about the vast majority of food products that come in a package). And what a sense of joy to create delicious treats that we enjoy to our hearts&#39; content! My daughter&#39;s favorite part of baking is adding love, which makes it taste better. -=-<br/>

If you can bring yourself to read at the links above, you will not find people feeling awful, simply saying it doesn’t make them feel good, being vehemently opposed to things, or not feelings good.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-And what a sense of joy to create delicious treats that we enjoy to our hearts&#39; content!-=-  What if you (the mom) could change just a little, so that your family could enjoy ANYthing to their hearts’ content?  What if your heart could be more content?<br/>
<br/>
Do you think that if someone lets a child eat hamburgers that it’s ALL he will ever eat?  <br/>
This is not the experience of those families that have relaxed control.<br/>
<br/>
Do you consider hamburgers to be processed food products that come in packages?<br/>
In my lifetime, every part of a hamburger has been villified, and each has, in turn, been the best (or only good) part. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2053147429">-=- I see it in my children at 10 and 14. Their relationship with food is so much better than mine.<br/>
The biggest thing is they don&#39;t feel guilty if they don&#39;t make the same choice I or anyone else decides is &quot;right &quot; or healthy. They eat what feels good when it feels good and put down a candy after a bite of it does not! -=-<br/>
<br/>
yep, I see the same thing in my daughter. She has a monkey platter for almost every meal, she always goes grocery shopping with me and we try new stuff when she wants. We often eat all different foods together, and so it&#39;s normal in my family to not get the same food at the same place, and they&#39;ve seen the unpleasant effects (and my desire to be near a toilet for hours afterward) of me eating things that disagree with my system. There&#39;s no shame, it&#39;s more of them feeling sorry for me that I&#39;m not enjoying what they are!<br/>
<br/>
I am concerned about the changes that have happened in the food supply, changes that I have seen directly affect my own ability to eat certain foods, things that surprised and confused me and spurred me onto research. While it&#39;s not fair of me to make some of the statements I made (sorry!) it&#39;s also not fair to say someone who sees things differently has bought into propaganda. <br/>
<br/>
Sandra, thank you for the links. I&#39;ll be quiet now and catch up on my reading. <br/>

I got plenty that summer, and learned what I needed to learn about how and when it can benefit me, or not. &nbsp;Not in my head, not from other people, but from my own gut.<br><br>My kids have been eating in peace, without the presence of negativity or fear or convoluted beliefs in their home about which foods are &quot;good&quot; &quot;real&quot; food, and which are not, for most of their young lives. &nbsp;They eat what they like, they leave what they don&#39;t, and they often choose things other kids might not ever touch (my older son frequently chooses cauliflower or green beans or boiled eggs over any of the other sweet or &quot;processed&quot; options he has available to him) without having been told by me that one choice is &quot;healthier&quot; or better than another. &nbsp;<br><br>My older son has talked recently about some of his food choices, telling me things like, &quot;Mom, I need starburst. My brain is just really busy and it just really needs like, more good energy.&quot; &nbsp;(Sugar, &quot;highly processed&quot; simple sugars are the best fuel for the brain, the easiest to digest, the quickest and most efficiently utilized by the brain--far more efficient than fruit or protein or fats (though he often likes those other things too)-- he doesn&#39;t know that in words or in an idea, but that knowledge lives inside of him in whole way. &nbsp;<br><br>The other day he was trying to explain to me that he wanted to eat, but his stomach didn&#39;t want food, his brain didn&#39;t want his stomach to have food, because it was too busy for food, this confused him, and he was trying to understand it. &nbsp;His words brought to my mind that when the stomach is digesting, it diverts energy and blood flow from other parts of the body in order to do it. &nbsp;Maybe his brain was the thing that needed the resources in that moment. :) Sometimes I try to say a little about those things, but mostly he is still too young to like much of me talking. :) &nbsp;Maybe it&#39;ll interest him someday, or maybe it&#39;ll never need to be a thing that needs to interest him at all. &nbsp;Maybe it&#39;ll just be another bit of his own internal wisdom that doesn&#39;t ever need to be pulled out and examined and looked at in a detached way.<br><br>It&#39;s been really, *really* cool to hear my introspective little boy start putting some of what he notices about himself into words. &nbsp;I&#39;m so grateful for the information and resources radical unschoolers like Sandra have made available, and discussed openly, tirelessly, at length, so that I have been able to protect so much of my children&#39;s natural integrity.<br><br>My son made a box cake last week, he likes boxed cakes because he isn&#39;t currently interested in the time and all the different steps of adding lots of ingredients for a from-scratch cake. &nbsp;Box cake is simple and quick and just exactly what he has time and interest and attention for. &nbsp;It&#39;s also really cheap, which is good for me, since he hardly ever eats much of the cakes we make, from-scratch or not! He enjoys the making more than the eating. :)<br>&nbsp;<br>He ate half of one piece of that cake and then the whole thing sat there untouched for the rest of the week. &nbsp;My husband and I enjoy cake and cookies and sweets, but neither of us ended up eating any of it, either (though I ate almost two dozen coconut chocolate pecan cookies I made over that same week! No one else liked them, but for me--YUUUMMMM). Boxed cake isn&#39;t often really very good, if you&#39;re used to eating what really tastes good to you. &nbsp;But it can also be just the right thing sometimes! &nbsp;I remember feeling like it was a rare delicacy when I was a child! &nbsp;I remember when it was the best thing I&#39;d ever tasted, fresh from the oven.&nbsp;<br><br>`Lisa Celedon &nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></span></div></div></html></div>

<br/>
“Fair” isn’t the measure of what is useful to the many unschoolers reading here.  Is it helpful to unschooling?  <br/>
To attempt to trade an apology for a bye is not fair.<br/>
<br/>
There IS propaganda about food.  There is a flood of propaganda about food in the past several years.  It is ruining lives.  It is ruining families.  It is ruining friendships.  It is ruining health.<br/>
There ARE people buying into that propaganda—often very literally, by buying books, by buying pre-packaged food by mail to eat more like their pre-historic ancestors.  <br/>
The fear of food that ruins lives is a cousin of anorexia, and bulemia.  Sometimes it lives in the same body as one of those, but it’s called orthorexia.  <br/>
Orthorexia nervosa.    It is not a good element of healthy unschooling.<br/>

But my point is that * they* have been calling the shots with regard to food choices. There is no pressure either way. They never asked to go to the large franchise burger places, they always preferred the ones I make at home.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-842275222"><p dir="ltr">Sandra&#39;s post mentioning eating disorders reminded me of some recent news items. Here in Australia there was a news story recently noting the increase in eating disorders in young people. While the most affected group were aged 15-24 they were seeing an increase in males, under 12&#39;s, and highlighted the fact that even kids as young as six (although uncommon) were presenting with eating disorders. When going back to find the link I then found essentially the same news story written two years ago with the same researcher being interviewed (a local Doctor in charge of a regional eating disorder group) &amp; the story back then was the youngest was 8 years old. Sadly this sort of headline wasn&#39;t unique to Aus &amp; seems to be a trend in other countries as well.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I&#39;ve linked the article at the bottom in case it&#39;s of interest but here&#39;s a quote:</p>
<p dir="ltr">&quot;There is a lot of comments coming from primary school children about dieting and not eating too much fat and not gaining weight.&quot;<br>
- Dr Melissa Hart</p>
<p dir="ltr">Primary school children here are aged 5-12.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There was also another news story this week where Doctors highlighted how the strong anti obesity messages in the media have contributed. We hear that in our media here a lot particularly about childhood obesity, diabetes etc &amp; whilst these can have health implications too there is definitely a lot of fear out there about food as a result.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At the same time those stories were running it was reported some schools had banned selling chocolate as part of school fundraisers. (Chocolate boxes that kids sell to relatives etc outside of school).</p>

&gt; I am concerned about the changes that have happened in the food supply,<br/>
&gt; changes that I have seen directly affect my own ability to eat certain foods,<br/>
&gt; things that surprised and confused me and spurred me onto research.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And what if someone had made you change your diet according to what *they* believed was damaging to health? What if someone stopped you from eating cows milk or rice or gluten or meat based on their “research” of what foods were bad?<br/>
<br/>
You got to decide what’s valuable to you. You got to decide how much you’d give up for what you felt you were gaining.<br/>
<br/>
You’re robbing your children of the opportunity to decide what’s important to them. You’re taking away their ability to decide what is a benefit to them and what is worth giving up for it. You’re deciding for them.<br/>
<br/>
If no one were eating fast food, it would be easy to convince them it’s poison. Children don’t need a lot of convincing that Drano is poison (once they understand poison.) No other kids are drinking Drano for fun and continuing on with their happy lives.<br/>
<br/>
The same is not true of McDonalds. People are happily eating McDonalds. It tastes good, especially to kids because it has lots of the calories their bodies burn up quickly in small packages that match the small size of their stomachs.<br/>
<br/>
As they get older, kids *will* change their tastes. They’ll also become more conscious of bigger ideas and which ideas are most important to them. Like the planet, money, pesticides, cooking, eating a certain way and so on. They may pick up and drop several ideas throughout childhood.<br/>
<br/>
If your goal is learning, then your children feeling free to explore different ideas will be important to you. If you goal is protection, then that will get in the way of trying ideas out.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; it&#39;s also not fair to say someone who sees things differently<br/>
&gt; has bought into propaganda. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, but it’s pretty common that when someone has “done the research” it means they’ve read articles that confirm what they’re growing to believe. It’s called cherry picking. And confirmation bias. The writers of all those articles do it too. I hope not deliberately! But once you start looking for confirmation of what you fear is true, you’ll see it everywhere. The reports that refute the fear will seem like noise and anomalies. What happens is that all the articles that agree with your fear come to feel right. All the articles that disagree come to feel wrong. It doesn’t help that the anti-chemistry side paints anyone who disagrees with them as the enemy and in the pockets of big business. It effectively creates a protective bubble around what they write. It gets labeled The Truth. Then even objective writers get labeled, The Liars.<br/>
<br/>
When all the issues are looked at without the fear colored glasses, it’s clear — especially to unschoolers — that if there are any dangers to our foods, they take a very very long time and a very off balance diet to have an effect. In other words, kids have time. Keeping kids away from “processed” foods is not an emergency. Kids have time to find the foods they like by trying. They can turn over information to decide what sounds right for them.<br/>
<br/>
Or they can unless a parent *tells* them this chemical is bad and this food is bad.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-631168792">I think most of us have internal ideas about what is ‘healthy’ and what is not.  I believe that some foods ARE better for our health than others.  I’m not sure this is really empirically disputable.  However, what is interesting is that externally imparted knowledge and education seem to have such little bearing on what we actually choose to eat in our own lives.  <br/>
<br/>
My sister is a nurse specialising in treatment of obesity and diabetes.  The government approach is all about education, education, education, and she spends her professional life educating people with real, compromising and sometimes life threatening health issues which could be significantly helped if they drastically changed their diet.  However, despite lots and lots of help and all the right information, most of her patients don’t change long term.  I’m so interested in why this is.  It seems a simple fix to an outsider - change your diet and save your life!!! But it just doesn’t work like that.<br/>
<br/>
I am starting to see how complicated our relationship with food is, and how external sources of ‘right’ and ‘wrong’ and being told what to do and eat by well-meaning parents, educators and professionals is pretty unlikely to have the ‘desired&#39; effect.  It seems food is tied up with a much more emotional part of our selves and that is why it seems important to me that food is treated with a light touch, with fun, humour, and delight where possible. All of it, all kinds of food.  The aforementioned sister was anorexic in her teens and bulemic in her 20’s.  She thankfully, at 40, is pretty sure that she is fully recovered and never wants her child or my children to know, but as a consequence we as a family have instinctively never talked about diets or judged food verbally as we are so aware where that can go, even before we knew about unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
Still more interestingly, her anorexia seems not to have been triggered by food messages - our family was pretty relaxed about food - but by other things in her life that were not going well.<br/>
<br/>
I’m still not clear about how my kids will negotiate that field in their lives.  What their relationship with food will be like.  I can’t ‘make it right’ for them, I don’t know what the right thing to do or say or be is.  All I know is that I want to quietly choose joy, and bring choices, wherever the opportunity presents itself.  Do as little harm as possible. Light touch. No big deal :-)<br/>

<br/>
Years ago, before we had children, Keith and I went to Weight Watchers.  He had been heavy since he was born.  I was up to 160 from my usual 130.  <br/>
I went for months.  Keith went once and wouldn’t go back.  He said the feeling of having an older woman tell him what to eat was too much.  His mom talked him talked him talked him his whole life.<br/>
Though he has lost weight as an adult, he’s diabetic the last few years and they assigned him “an educator,” who has called him at home a few times.  So now it’s a female with a foreign accent who accosts him in his own home when he’s minding his own business.  This is not pleasant for him at all.<br/>
<br/>
Over 30 years, I gained weight, Keith lost weight.  When I go to a new doctor for a checkup or if I’m in somewhere where they don’t have a chart on me already, they seem disappointed (irritated) that my blood pressure is low and I’m not diabetic.  They would like to shame me.  They want to show me that I’m dying, but I’m not.  <br/>
<br/>
Putting these kinds of pressure on young children under ANY circumstances can cause lifelong harm.<br/>
Adding those kinds of pressures to unschooling can ruin unschooling (and cause lifelong harm).  <br/>
<br/>
And the pressures aren’t always true, either.  The claims of “if you want to live” sound like that person has the power of life or death, and that you’re an idiot. <br/>
<br/>
That might possibly, Belinda, be part of why some people don’t want to change their diet when it seems that it’s to create success for “an educator.”<br/>
<br/>
-=-despite lots and lots of help and all the right information-=-<br/>
“The right information” has changed many times just in my lifetime.<br/>
And “lots and lots of help” is only helpful if the learner IS being helped.  <br/>
That model of lots of help and right information is just like school.   And school says “if you don’t want to grow up stupid, not reading, jobless, you MUST do everything we’re saying.”<br/>
<br/>
There is antagonism and some dishonesty (sometimes) and bad information (that’s not yet known to be bad, because people discover more and other information, always).<br/>
<br/>
-=- I don’t know what the right thing to do or say or be is. All I know is that I want to quietly choose joy, and bring choices, wherever the opportunity presents itself. Do as little harm as possible. Light touch. No big deal :-)-=-<br/>
<br/>
Light touch IS a big deal, because some people believe they’re being subtle about their judgments when the others around them take their clues as loud communications and blatant put-downs.  Some people can read other people very well, and a certain sort of intake of breath, or posture, or eye movement can show disgust and rejection.  So pretending not to care isn’t the same as learning to accept. :-)<br/>
<br/>
But “Do as little harm as possible” is as good a goal as I can think of with all of this topic.<br/>
<br/>
The larger topic is still unschooling and how things affect the learning and relationships that make unschooling rich and good.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1448234518">This conversation reminds me of a complaint my mother had about the DARE program 30 years ago. She said the information and the approach was so dishonest and patronising, that any kids who heard this stuff and then survived their first encounter with cannabis was going to assume *everything* they&#39;d been told was lies and scare tactics, and behave reactively instead of making their own assessments. <div><br></div>There is a growing culture of thinking of food in terms of risk/reward, and of thinking of it as medicine *always*. I imagine that is *very* recent in human history, in terms of readily available foods that are safe to obtain (as opposed to risking death on the mammoth hunt or gathering birds&#39; nests on a cliffside). It&#39;s become a big problem for me, because of serious health issues in my recent past *despite* a careful diet, and so I have to put a lot of energy into finding peace with that so that I don&#39;t pass it on. <div><br><div><div>My kids will develop their own risk/reward matrix about food, and it will look different from mine, and it will be based on their life experiences. It&#39;s clear that human food dynamics are complex, maybe more so than ever before because of the range of options and the politicization of the food supply information (what and how you eat is supposed to be a political statement, and you *have to* have a rationale and an excuse, according to the buzz). How nice it would be *not* to bequeath that source of angst and aggravation to my kids!</div><div><br></div><div>Sarah</div></div></div></div>

<br/>
Yes.  Trust grows when someone is trustworthy.  <br/>
If a child is too young to know whether the parent is worthy of trust, then what?  <br/>
This goes onto my list of things to add to my advanced unschooling ideas for Sunday.  I was already going to talk about trust, but this is important.<br/>
<br/>
I have used an analogy in the past about there being a turd in the lemonade.  If there is lemonate that is clean, then it’s lemonade (either American lemonade which is thick and tart, or UK lemonade which is carbonated and light, like 7-Up without lime).   If there is a turn in there, then what?  Does it matter how big the turd is or who or what it came out of?<br/>
<br/>
[Yes, yes… there can be imperceptible fly turds.  Gnat turds.  No one would call those turds–they’re called “specks.”<br/>
Yes, yes about any other “yeah but” responses to picturing a turd in lemonade.]<br/>
<br/>
When someone lies sometimes, but not always, but sometimes she will state something as fact when it is not fact, then that is a turd in the lemonade.  How much of the rest of what she says will you “take to the bank”?  <br/>
And if you know that someone lies 5% of the time, or 15%, and you’re not sure about the current statement, you will most likely NOT give it 85% or 95% credence.  <br/>
<br/>
So back to the mom and scare tactics or exaggerations or threats.  If the child has built up years and years of faith and trust in the mom and discovers she was dishonest about something, there is a turd in a LOT of years’ worth of lemonade then.  How much of the faith in the mom will spill out if the child angrily dismisses her opinion and goes against it?<br/>
<br/>
If a mom lies to keep a child from eating a cupcake, will the child later ask her advice about budding romance?  sexual relationships?  buying a car or a house?<br/>
How many cupcakes woud that mom be willing to share with that child later, if it would restore that trust?<br/>
