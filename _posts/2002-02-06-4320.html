<div id="ygrps-yiv-1721816493">We live in Texas and do not have to justify our homeschooling education so I<br/>
have no experience in this area.  My karate students just passed their belt<br/>
tests (yea!) and my instructor, who tests them, asked to see grades next<br/>
time.  This is standard in his testing procedure.  Most of the kids are<br/>
school-at-homers so it isn&#39;t a problem for them.  I attempted to talk to my<br/>
instructor about unschooling, but he thinks homeschoolers are kind of nuts,<br/>
that &quot;everyone&quot; goes to college these days, and &quot;how are you going to know<br/>
they are properly progressing&quot; if you don&#39;t test them.  It doesn&#39;t help that<br/>
I&#39;m the resident &quot;pinko&quot; in a nest of Republicans &lt;g&gt;.You get the picture.<br/>
Amazingly, I love this guy dearly and he tolerates me quite well too :)<br/>
<br/>
I refuse to grade my dd but I don&#39;t want my instructor to subconsciously<br/>
think less of her (I don&#39;t think he would purposely fail her on her belt<br/>
test or anything like that.)  My plan was to write a brief summary of the<br/>
things she likes to do and &quot;schooly&quot; skills that she possesses.  Thoughts?<br/>
<br/>
Now for the &quot;aha&quot; moment.  I have been actively working for about 2 years to<br/>
lessen the coercion with my kids.  I have always tried to listen to them,<br/>
work with them gently, etc., but there was no question that I was the boss.<br/>
Most days we do pretty good, when I am stressed, not so good.  I easily<br/>
resort back to control and have to actively watch myself.  My 5yo, Marsie,<br/>
is the real life version of Junie B. Jones and I adore her.  She is a prima<br/>
donna which is quite difficult when you are the middle of 5 children.  She<br/>
is very dramatic and when things don&#39;t go her way, she is given to loud and<br/>
tearful exits.  I usually see these things coming (usually when she is not<br/>
in sufficient control of everything and everybody to suit her) and would<br/>
suggest going for a walk, playing with me, etc..  Nothing helped much.  Then<br/>
it finally dawned on me......why not give her a place where she can be in<br/>
total control?  We talked about &quot;Marsie time&quot; and when she starts to feel<br/>
out of sorts she now asks for it.  It is complete and total control over her<br/>
domain for as long as she wants it.  She goes to her room and locks the door<br/>
and plays and plays and plays. She wears her princess crown and the magician<br/>
cape I made for her (she likes to make us disappear when we have offended<br/>
her sensibilities &lt;g&gt;), takes a tape player and listens to &quot;Problem Child&quot;<br/>
by AC/DC very loud (hmmmm.)  From the outside, it looks no different than<br/>
Marsie going to her room until she feels like being civil (which is what<br/>
used to be asked of her and she would melt into a tantrum) but by couching<br/>
it in terms of her needs, how to meet those needs rather than control them,<br/>
she thinks it is a great idea and actively participates in utilizing it.  I<br/>
think there is hope for us yet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-510345463">Wow, Julie!  &quot;Marsie time&quot;.  I like that.  My dd needs lots of control and <br/>
loves to stomp to her room, fling herself on the bed, cry long and lustily, <br/>
and then &quot;mooch&quot; her way back onto my lap.  I think we can start to have <br/>
&quot;Mira time&quot; if I can couch it in cool language like that.  <br/>
<br/>
I, too, revert to &quot;THE GENERAL&quot; when under stress...especially when we are <br/>
running late.  I am trying to modify my behavior so as to reduce the amount <br/>
of yelling that happens.  It really helps when I think of how the <br/>
&quot;old-timers&quot; must have had to deal with all this stuff, too, and that Sandra <br/>
was not born with the wisdom she has now.  Ah, someday....<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for some great food for thought.<br/>
