<br/>
Telling kids what to do is not modeling what to do.<br/>
<br/>
A huge part of the unschooling journey (and re-parenting oneself) is to<br/>
realize *what* exactly it is we&#39;re modeling to our kids.<br/>

Thanks so much, Beth, for the way you put the above remark I quoted.  It&#39;s<br/>
what a lot of people don&#39;t get about unschooling or parenting.  It&#39;s been<br/>
said before and could stand to be said again and then highlighted.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;d be a great page for Joyce or Sandra&#39;s site.<br/>
<br/>
So here... I&#39;ve start a thread on it:  What does much of conventional<br/>
parenting actually model to children?<br/>
