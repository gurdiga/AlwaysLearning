<div id="ygrps-yiv-779766488">I had a thought this morning about the recent criticism of the advice  <br/>
to do more.  The past week on this list has seen several mothers of  <br/>
babies assuring us they could tell us how to help unschoolers, and  <br/>
that our advice was lacking.    (Some of them have apologized, or come  <br/>
near it, in side e-mail, so I&#39;m not trying to stir that up again.)<br/>
<br/>
I do believe that it must be nearly impossible to begin to deschool in  <br/>
the absence of school-age concerns, so it&#39;s possible that the mother  <br/>
of a baby who reads all the deschooling articles she can find will nod  <br/>
and say &quot;Yep, got it; done.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In school, reading and being able to answer ten questions at the end  <br/>
equals perfect learning.  There&#39;s nothing better than 100%, unless  <br/>
it&#39;s getting a bonus question too.   And in school, once you&#39;ve  <br/>
&quot;passed&quot; a course (such as &quot;Deschooling for Parents&quot;), you never have  <br/>
to take it again.<br/>
<br/>
And so a lack of deschooling will make deschooling impossible.<br/>
And the lack of a school-aged child might make deschooling nonsensical.<br/>
And someone who thinks she&#39;s been unschooling for four years might  <br/>
discover that on that day when her child doesn&#39;t go to school, she  <br/>
needs to begin deschooling.  Not the child, who hasn&#39;t been to school,  <br/>
perhaps.  But the mom, who spent ten or thirteen years in government  <br/>
or private school, and then maybe two to ten years in universities or  <br/>
something, and maybe taught a while, and then spent four or five years  <br/>
thinking she was a graduate of the online deschooling course.<br/>
<br/>
Reciting back what the deschooling articles say isn&#39;t being deschooled.<br/>
If that were true, then reading the Bill W book and being able to  <br/>
recite it back and pass a test would be as good as actually going to  <br/>
meetings and not drinking anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Because unschooling is action, choices and doing, then reading and  <br/>
writing about it isn&#39;t unschooling.  It&#39;s helping people prepare  <br/>
themselves to make better choices.   Unschooling is a way of being.   <br/>
Reading can help people change, but reading doesn&#39;t change your next  <br/>
decision.  Your own thoughts and understanding and awareness change  <br/>
your next decision.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-775597074">Hi! I&#39;m new to this group and new to unschooling. I just began about two weeks ago, and I&#39;m struggling with the deschooling process, so I&#39;m just looking for some insight about what I can do to create a better unschooling environment for myself and to rid myself of all of the schooly notions. I should probably give a little bit of background information first. I&#39;m 16, and I began looking into unschooling back in October. My Mom was hesitant at first, but decided in early December that unschooling would in fact be good for me. My father, on the other hand, is very unsupportive. My parents are divorced and my mother has custody of me. We signed up to attend the UWWG and my dad at first agreed to go, but later emailed by mom saying he didn&#39;t want to because he didn&#39;t want me to get the idea that he supported me unschooling in any way. Since I&#39;ve been out of school, I&#39;ve oftentimes felt guilty about not learning enough and doing enough. I know a lot of it is because my dad is constantly questioning what I&#39;m doing, and makes rude remarks about things not being educational, and gets angry with me if I don&#39;t want to do something with him (like going to a museum). I guess I&#39;m just looking for ideas to relieve some of the pressure and to feel more comfortable about what I&#39;m doing. Also, and I probably should have mentioned this earlier, going back to school is not a possibility. I have a lot of emotional and stress issues and school really just exacerbated the problems, to the point that I was becoming incapable of going about daily things and I became physically ill. <br/>
<br/>
Any advice would be greatly appreciated! <br/>

<br/>
Was he supportive of you when you were in school?<br/>
<br/>
Are there any ways in which he is supportive?  Maybe we can give you  <br/>
ideas about how to build on that.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Since I&#39;ve been out of school, I&#39;ve oftentimes felt guilty about  <br/>
not learning enough and doing enough. I know a lot of it is because my  <br/>
dad is constantly questioning what I&#39;m doing, and makes rude remarks  <br/>
about things not being educational, and gets angry with me if I don&#39;t  <br/>
want to do something with him (like going to a museum).-=-<br/>
<br/>
Are you required to hang out with him a certain number of hours?   <br/>
Maybe you could cut that down for a while, or if you&#39;re old enough to  <br/>
bail early (if you&#39;re driving, maybe you could ask him to talk about  <br/>
something besides school, since you&#39;re not IN school,&quot; and if he  <br/>
doesn&#39;t figure out how to change the subject, leave.   Train him, by  <br/>
staying longer if he doesn&#39;t get onto that subject. &lt;g&gt;  Operant  <br/>
conditioning.<br/>
<br/>
As to &quot;not learning enough,&quot; if you&#39;re unschooling right you shouldn&#39;t  <br/>
realize what you&#39;re learning as you learn it.   As the connections  <br/>
start to build and you look back and see the richness of the months or  <br/>
years before, that&#39;s when you&#39;ll know.<br/>
<br/>
In school there are report cards and progress this&#39;n&#39;that.  You&#39;re not  <br/>
in school.<br/>
<br/>
If your dad does e-mail, maybe you could exchange links to interesting  <br/>
videos or sites, and you could send him links to things that seem  <br/>
particularly educational, from his point of view.   Show him a little  <br/>
what he wants to see and don&#39;t rub his nose in what he doesn&#39;t want to  <br/>
see, maybe.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-719225235">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; If your dad does e-mail, maybe you could exchange links to interesting<br/>
videos or sites, and you could send him links to things that seem<br/>

<br/>
I think that I would back off from using the term &quot;unschooling&quot; around your<br/>
dad, and talk about &quot;home learning&quot; and &quot;alternative education&quot;, if you are<br/>
talking about what you are doing at all. He may not be able to wrap his head<br/>
around unschooling, and he is probably worried. Perhaps you can show him how<br/>
vocational some of your activities could be. &quot;Vocational&quot; is a good<br/>
practical forward looking concept for people still trying to accept passion<br/>
based learning.<br/>
<br/>
My late mother was sometimes ignorant and yet still vocal about her opinion.<br/>
What I found helpful was to find information from sources that she respected<br/>
(ie &quot;experts&quot;), rather than showing her the very same information from other<br/>
mothers. Perhaps your father would be more acceptant of information about<br/>
learning from people with plenty of letters after their name and various<br/>
awards.<br/>
<br/>
For example John Taylor Gatto&#39;s critiques of the school system come from a<br/>
repeat winner of New York Teacher of the Year<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/.">http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/.</a> Howard Gardner (the theory of multiple<br/>
intelligences) <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.howardgardner.com/">http://www.howardgardner.com/</a> is Professor of Education at<br/>
Harvard. He might also find some food for thought from some of the brilliant<br/>
thinking expressed in some of the TED talks. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ted.com/">http://www.ted.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
These would show him that there are other ways to become educated and<br/>
successful outside of school, expressed in a way that makes sense to him,<br/>
rather than as seeing you as a &quot;dropout&quot; or whatever label his unfortunate<br/>
fears are giving you.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps your mother could gently point out to him that if he wants to spend<br/>
time with you, criticizing and rude remarks are hardly conducive to your<br/>
wishing to be in his company. You might also reassure him that home schooled<br/>
kids still go to good colleges, without necessarily making a commitment to<br/>
do so at any specific time yourself. One phrase that might help is &quot;I<br/>
haven&#39;t ruled that out&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
Could he not separate it?  He doesn&#39;t have to like what you are doing to support YOU as a person.  Lots of parents give that argument to their kids who want to study art, but the parents want them to be a doctor. <br/>
<br/>
***I know a lot of it is because my dad is constantly questioning what I&#39;m doing, and makes rude remarks about things not being educational, and gets angry with me if I don&#39;t want to do something with him (like going to a museum).***<br/>
<br/>
Can you beat him to the suggestion box?  Maybe instead of having him plan your time together, you could plan the time and invite him?  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to know what kind of relationship you have with your father.  I do know this, sometimes kids don&#39;t maintain relationships with their parents when they are older.  You could maybe suggest that you&#39;d like to have a better relationship with him, and that in 2 yrs, you could choose not to have one at all.<br/>

relationship with him, and that in 2 yrs, you could choose not to have  <br/>

<br/>
At sixteen, it might already be time you could choose that, depending  <br/>
on the state and the decree.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you could tell him that you really do want him to go to the  <br/>
water park, really.  So that he can see some unschooling dads (Broc  <br/>
Higgins and BenLovejoy will be there, and many others).   You might  <br/>
find a way (tactfully if possible, but if not, not) to say that if  <br/>
he&#39;s not even willing to go and do that one thing to learn about  <br/>
unschooling, that he will waive his right to discuss it with you at  <br/>
all, because as it stands he only knows about school, while you and  <br/>
your mom know about school AND unschooling.  He&#39;s not qualified to  <br/>
debate it in any way.<br/>
<br/>
If he still refused to go, if it were me, I would probably bring it up  <br/>
every time he invited me anywhere for a while.  If he said &quot;Do you  <br/>
want to go to the movies?&quot;   (thinking of myself as a teen...) I might  <br/>
say &quot;Do you want me to?&quot;   If he said I just thought you might want  <br/>
to, I&#39;d say &quot;Not really, no thanks.&quot;  But if he said &quot;I&#39;d like that.&quot;   <br/>
I&#39;d say &quot;When I asked you to go to the water park you refused, and I  <br/>
REALLY wanted you to go.  But I&#39;ll go to the movies with you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Seriously.  This is a harsh recommendation for me, but your dad&#39;s  <br/>
being a bully, and if you can use his own motions against him, that&#39;s  <br/>
not cheating.<br/>
