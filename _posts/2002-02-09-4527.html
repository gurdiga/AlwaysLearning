<div id="ygrps-yiv-1150030382">&lt;&lt;(I&#39;ve met Eric, and Susan and their daughters, and they are just about the<br/>
coolest family you can imagine.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I came home yesterday, after having been gone for hours, with five grocery<br/>
bags full of stuff to be put away. The dishes hadn¹t been touched, the<br/>
animals hadn¹t been fed and my youngest daughter was waiting by the door for<br/>
the car so she could go out with her friend.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter began the process (several days ago) of unpacking her<br/>
travel backpack and sorting through old bags of her stuff and there are<br/>
shirts and pants and books and papers all over the floor in our music room.<br/>
<br/>
My husband finally purchased our first snow blower and just discovered it¹s<br/>
missing an important part, but can¹t find the receipt to prove he even<br/>
bought it in the first place. (Admittedly not like him.) We¹ve expecting<br/>
more than six inches of snow this afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
I¹m writing the script for our theater group¹s next performance and the<br/>
auditions are in two days. I¹m only through the first act and still don¹t<br/>
know if I¹m even going to include two or three characters or how I¹m going<br/>
to end it.<br/>
<br/>
The sheets need to be changed, the dog needs a bath, the cats¹ nails need to<br/>
be cut, I have a stack of papers I¹m afraid to look in because I might<br/>
discover something I should have taken care of long ago...and my right<br/>
nostril is dripping.<br/>
<br/>
I ate a baker¹s dozen chocolate chip cookies at 11 o¹clock last night and<br/>
went into the freezer to get the rest to have for breakfast this morning<br/>
(they were gone).<br/>
<br/>
Susan, not feeling very cool (but thanks anyway, Sandra)</div>
