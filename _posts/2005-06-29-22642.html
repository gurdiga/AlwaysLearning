<div id="ygrps-yiv-1468295691">Last year was our &quot;kindergarten&quot; year of homeschooling and for the <br/>
first month or so I was very structured. I kept track of what we did <br/>
and what subject. We did daily circle time (singing, stories read, poem <br/>
recited, spanish and asl vocabulary) and little worksheets. My son was <br/>
very much into all of this and if he wasn&#39;t we didn&#39;t do it. Well, we <br/>
ended up moving across country and I just couldn&#39;t maintain that much <br/>
structure. Now, he is begging for circle time and he says he misses the <br/>
little activities. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just wondering if anyone else has experienced this and if y&#39;all <br/>
have tips for overcoming my own inner dislike of structure.<br/>
<br/>
I guess, now that I think about it, it&#39;s just a matter of singing and <br/>
stories together (and whatever else he is into) and having activities <br/>
available whenever he wants. Maybe I can put together a little folder <br/>
of worksheets that he can chose or not? Ug, it still feels so, I don&#39;t <br/>
know, arbitrary.</div>

 </span></blockquote>You can do it without really LIKING it.   Do it in the least harsh and <br/>
schooly way you can, so that the parts he likes about it are the &quot;most unschooling&quot; <br/>
kinds of parts.   Read books about play and freedom, rather than about school <br/>
and classrooms.   Sing songs about the joy of the woods, and bunnies and <br/>
birds, rather than about academics.<br/>
<br/>
BUT on the other hand, there are some great &quot;academic&quot;/educational songs out <br/>
there, like the Animaniacs songs about the state capitals or the nations of <br/>
the world.   Unfortunately, they&#39;re not on DVD yet, but they&#39;re on VHS <br/>
(singalong videos) and CD.   <br/>
<br/>
When my kids were little we listened to a lot of very sweet music and still <br/>
those songs come up.   Holly was watching Raffi in Concert just last week.   <br/>
She asked me about Baby Beluga and I couldn&#39;t remember all the words or find the <br/>
old cassette tape, but got out the video and started winding to look for it.  <br/>
 She got cranky and said just let it play, and watched the whole thing.    <br/>
Then I found a book I had not found in the first quick search.   A picture book <br/>
with the lyrics which I did NOT have when the kids were little, but bought <br/>
within the last year at a thrift store.   With my youngest 13, I still bought a <br/>
Raffi picture book, and it was still put to use.   <br/>
<br/>
So I would not speak against a scheduled reading and music session.   Let him <br/>
have a folder of worksheets, but maybe a good thing to put in the folder <br/>
would be song lyrics, and you could sing from the lyrics sheets and put them back, <br/>
and not &quot;make it a reading lesson,&quot; but make it a clear use of words on <br/>
paper, and if you sing from the same papers a lot (or from picture books with <br/>
lyrics), that will help with music AND reading and the material of the song too.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids were little I would have to transcribe songs out for them, but <br/>
now you can lift them from lyrics sites on the internet very easily.   <br/>
<br/>
We have lots of books with the lyrics of a single song, illustrated, so you <br/>
have to turn the pages too fast sometimes for singing in rhythm, but you could <br/>
do one verse and then go back and look at the pictures, and then do another <br/>
verse.    We have The Erie Canal like that, and I like the illustrations, but <br/>
that&#39;s the one   you really have to barrel through the pages on. &lt;g&gt;   Others <br/>
have several lines per page and that&#39;s easier.<br/>
<br/>
Wanting a little structure isn&#39;t the same as wanting school at home all day, <br/>
and it will probably pass anyway.   I&#39;d do it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-790253431">I forgot to mention one thing that was lots of fun when Holly was younger and <br/>
really wanted to read, but wasn&#39;t there yet.    <br/>
<br/>
I know this can be done on a Mac but I don&#39;t know about a PC.   Someone <br/>
advise for those particulars if my directions don&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
I took the lyrics of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, removed <br/>
all punctuation, used search-and-replace to turn all the spaces into returns so <br/>
that it was a long list of single words, and then used sort and alpha (used to <br/>
be under tools on the word menu, but those   menus change some).   So I <br/>
alphabetized a list of all the words in the lyrics.   It was fun!   And she could <br/>
see how many times words like &quot;and&quot; and &quot;the&quot; are used, how many times &quot;Joseph&quot; <br/>
was used but that some words were only used once.   <br/>

<br/>
My suspicion is that maybe he is missing the focused individual attention<br/>
from you for a comfortable length of time on a predictable basis - stability<br/>
and predictability both areas that are disrupted by moving home.<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion is to do more activities with him, asking him to choose them<br/>
and take the lead in the games, and for you to let go of the academic<br/>
keeping track - depending on your State laws, but at least over summer. <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps instead of thinking of it as &quot;structure&quot;, think of it as &quot;routine&quot;<br/>
so that he has the comfort of knowing that he can have your undivided<br/>
attention for three hours before lunch or whatever works out. The fluid kind<br/>
of movement from one interest to another during a day that is often reported<br/>
by many Unschoolers will most likely come in time.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Maybe I can put together a little folder <br/>
of worksheets that he can chose or not? Ug, it still feels so, I don&#39;t <br/>
know, arbitrary. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not arbitrary if they are worksheets he is interested in and he is free<br/>
to choose or not. <br/>
<br/>
However as I said, having them there for him to do may not be answering the<br/>
whole underlying need.<br/>

I found through the years when the younger kids were asking for more  <br/>
&quot;structure&quot; they were actually asking for more time with me.  We were a  family of <br/>
seven - military - with our share of moves, so there were certainly  times when <br/>
I was doing LIFE and not giving them the attention they wanted.<br/>
 <br/>
I remember for a period of several months I made myself available to Donika  <br/>
and Devin in the afternoon on every M W F - if they wanted.  Trevor was a  <br/>
baby and usually napping for at least part of that time - so we could read or  <br/>
play games - their choice.<br/>
 <br/>
When they were older and asked for structure they were asking for help in  <br/>
defining learning objectives.  Shawn especially wanted that - and stuck  with it <br/>
for long periods of time when he was 12/13.  He set his own  schedule of <br/>
structured learning when he was 17 to then take the GED.<br/>
