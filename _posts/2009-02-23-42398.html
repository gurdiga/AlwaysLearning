One angle you might take is to talk about how Jesus learned.  If  <br/>
Jewish education was anything like what is known to be traditional,  <br/>
then it involved him being encouraged to ask questions, which would  <br/>
have been respectfully explored with him.<br/>
<br/>
Richard Prystowsky and I did a talk together once called &quot;To Question  <br/>
or Not to Question:  That is the Question.&quot;     We were talking about  <br/>
the fact (which he, being raised Jewish by people with learning and  <br/>
leisure, didn&#39;t know) that MANY Christian children are told to shut  <br/>
up, be quiet, don&#39;t ask so many questions, or don&#39;t ask any  <br/>
questions.   He was stunned to hear some of the things I and my  <br/>
relatives and friends were told as little kids.    I was jealous when  <br/>
I was a teen and discovered there was  whole world or people who LIKE  <br/>
their children, who laugh with them, and encourage them, and answer  <br/>
all the question they want to ask, and that there are rabbis whose  <br/>
specialty it is to discuss philosophy with little children.<br/>
<br/>
Baptist kids memorize a lot of Bible verses and learn Bible stories.<br/>
Catholic kids memorize a catechism:  answers to a short list of  <br/>
questions, which they must answer formally in exactly those words.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, in neighborhoods far outside Espanola, New Mexico, there  <br/>
were kids who were honestly, openly and fearlessly talking about REAL  <br/>
ideas, with adults, who weren&#39;t slapping them or shaming them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1432707233">Hi Sharon,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;ve been reading this list for a while now and this is my first response, so I hope that I have posted correctly)<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
One of the persuasions that led me to unschooling was looking at Jesus&#39; example.  He lived life with the disciples, he would answer their questions, he would share stories of how to live life. He was gentle and loving. He loved the children and when the children came to him he did not turn them away. He would answer questions of people and would help them yet he never forced himself on anyone, it was their choice in which direction they would go, he was there to guide and help. He wanted people to come to him out of their own free will, not because they had to.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling to me is guiding our children by taking part in their childhood, to be here when they have questions, to be gentle and loving, help to inspire their curiosity by strewing all kinds of fun things. Being part of their lives and enjoying all kinds of fun adventures with them.  Making sure their needs are met and if a need hasn&#39;t been met then find ways of meeting that need.  Being an active participant in their lives and being available to them.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve/we&#39;ve been deschooling/unschooling since June of last year and in this period of time my daughter 13 has opened up more and she laughs and jokes more. She is gentle and kind. She now reads for pleasure, this is a miracle in itself. Our relationship has become very close, she comes to me now instead of friends for advice and answers and we have a lot of fun together.  My son 9 took to unschooling like a fish to water, he loves doing all kinds of things and he helps keep me in shape by doing a lot of hiking, walking, playing, gardening, ect. He and his sister are best buddies they have &quot;sleep overs&quot; at least 2 times a week. It&#39;s been wonderful to see the joy that comes with unschooling and our family has embraced this joy.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps Sharon,<br/>
<br/>
Best whishes on your discussion and I love the title you&#39;ve chosen to use.<br/>

He loved the children ...-=-<br/>
<br/>
All true.<br/>
<br/>
Also true (well, &quot;equally true&quot;):  Jesus told his disciples to leave  <br/>
their families and follow him.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I found something with lots of references.  I don&#39;t want to look them  <br/>
all up.<br/>
<br/>
The first striking thing for anyone prepared to read the gospels is  <br/>
that Jesus was no supporter of family values. He rejected his mother  <br/>
more than once, just as he rejected the rest of his family. He had no  <br/>
qualms about taking his disciples away from their families. The  <br/>
brothers James and John abandoned their father, leaving him to manage  <br/>
as best he could with the fishing nets they had been preparing  <br/>
together. On one occasion, a disciple asked permission to go and bury  <br/>
his dead father: &quot;But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead  <br/>
bury the dead&quot; (Matthew 8:22 c/f Luke 9:60). Jesus then refused  <br/>
another potential follower who asked permission to say good-bye to his  <br/>
family before abandoning them (Luke 9:61-62). This attitude was  <br/>
entirely in line with Jesus&#39; purpose: &quot;For I am come to set a man at  <br/>
variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and  <br/>
the daughter in law against the mother in law&quot; (Matthew 10:35). Jesus  <br/>
consistently taught that his followers should abandon and despise  <br/>
their families. Everlasting life is promised to those who leave their  <br/>
homes and families (Matthew 19:29, Mark 10:29-30 and Luke 18:29-30).  <br/>
The Luke author gives Jesus&#39; summary of his views on family life: &quot;If  <br/>
any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and  <br/>
children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he  <br/>
cannot be my disciple&quot; (Luke 14:26, Cf. Matthew 19:29).<br/>
<br/>
Everyone picks and chooses what to believe, no matter how much they  <br/>
deny it.  No one follows everything in the Bible, which is good.  <br/>
There&#39;s a lot of sex and violence to gloss over to get to the  <br/>
peace&#39;n&#39;love parts.<br/>

<br/>
Wow!! Powerful!!  How did Jesus learn in a Jewish culture...I am going<br/>
to have get Josephus out and read it, do some research.  That would be<br/>
a great study topic for me in general, how is learning done in other<br/>
cultures.<br/>
<br/>
I know for myself,  the things that I am really love were things I<br/>
researched myself.  Now I am certified herbalist, natural health<br/>
educator, life coach, doula;  all because I desired to know.  It all<br/>
happened after I was 30.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Another interesting tidbit about Jewish education is that when the <br/>
rabbis discuss a child learning the Torah, they literally say they <br/>
are &quot;learning the Torah together.&quot;  The rabbis feel that they have as <br/>
much to learn from the child as they have to teach.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, the Hebrew word for &quot;infant&quot; is used for children under the age <br/>
of 5.  That doesn&#39;t have much to do with learning or unschooling, but <br/>
I&#39;ve found that when people look at their little ones as still being <br/>
babies, things like &quot;independence&quot; and preschool work and chores seem <br/>
odd.  <br/>
<br/>
Bible times Jews didn&#39;t spank.  There are some great articles on <br/>
the &quot;rod&quot; verses in the Bible here: aolff.com and what they actually <br/>
mean from a Hebraic perspective.  Not that that has anything to do with <br/>
unschooling either, except that gentle parenting is probably a first <br/>
step to unschooling for some people.<br/>

story the meaning of which is altered in translation over time...<br/>

family.  Parts of the Bible are simply history- history is full of <br/>

The urgency I have been feeling was made even greater. We are on a great path and I see my relationship with my 14 year old son really doing better and better. The book Parent/Teen Breakthrough and this page and the Yahoo groups have been so beneficial as well as Sandra&#39;s site and Living Joyfully. I have learned so much. Even though his life of relaxed/eclectic homeschooling seemed like freedom to most who observed, I can see how it was not the relationship centered lifestyle that would develop the most peace and joy in my home.

I am extending a lot of trust to Stevie. I believe I must but I am hanging on to a lot of fear. In his life he has always been drawn to &quot;the risky&quot; or &quot;inappropriate&quot; maybe even because he&#39;s grown up with those labels from me. The thing is, we haven&#39;t stopped him from these things but have shared our views. So for example, right now it&#39;s pretty vulgar rap music which his sister is offended by. He has gotten pretty good at playing it less around her. He&#39;ll share videos with me and we&#39;ll talk about them. He thinks they&#39;re funny. Sometimes I agree, sometimes I&#39;ll say they&#39;re womanizing or a bit lacking in vocabulary (F,F,F). He likes the music (he is a musician). I don&#39;t (I&#39;m a bit of a Rock n Roll snob and don&#39;t hear enough guitars!) but we can have good conversations.

The urgency I have been feeling was made even greater. We are on a great path and I see my relationship with my 14 year old son really doing better and better. The book Parent/Teen Breakthrough and this page and the Yahoo groups have been so beneficial as well as Sandra&#39;s site and Living Joyfully. I have learned so much. Even though his life of relaxed/eclectic homeschooling seemed like freedom to most who observed, I can see how it was not the relationship centered lifestyle that would develop the most peace and joy in my home. He&#39;s my youngest. My husband runs his business out of our home. My 18 year old and 22 year old live with us and we are a pretty happy family unit. </span><br>

I am extending a lot of trust to Stevie. I believe I must but I am hanging on to a lot of fear. In his life he has always been drawn to &quot;the risky&quot; or &quot;inappropriate&quot; maybe even because he&#39;s grown up with those labels from me. The thing is, we haven&#39;t stopped him from these things but have shared our views. So for example, right now it&#39;s pretty vulgar rap music which his sister is offended by. He has gotten pretty good at playing it less around her. He&#39;ll share videos with me and we&#39;ll talk about them. He thinks they&#39;re funny. Sometimes I agree, sometimes I&#39;ll say they&#39;re womanizing or a bit lacking in vocabulary (F,F,F). He likes the music (he is a musician). I don&#39;t (I&#39;m a bit of a Rock n Roll snob and don&#39;t hear enough guitars!) but we can have good conversations. I feel like (hopefully) I&#39;m grasping the idea of mutual respect here in the are of what I would have once called inappropriate. </p>

If parents have a good relationship with their child, they talk about drugs in an informative way, they talk about their own experiences, and provide their opinions (without the expectation that their child will agree with it). It&#39;s not like they hand their kid a joint, but they do (and I&#39;ve seen this) say &quot;If you are going to experiment, I&#39;d rather you do it at home. If you are out, though, and you need help, you can call me and I&#39;ll come get you&quot; or provide whatever other help they need. Kids make mistakes! They need to know you&#39;re going to be there, in solid and practical ways, along with the emotional support they may need.<br><br>~ Maybe this never happens but I can&#39;t believe that, especially with those starting late like us.~ <br><br>As my husband says &quot;Hope is not a strategy.&quot;<br><br>Be informed. Be available. Ask your son for his thoughts. Do your best to get over *your* fears. Your relationship can&#39;t help but improve if you do the work on yourself. <br><br>Then, I&#39;ll bet, those fears will dissipate. You will have a stronger foundation and consequently, so will he.<br><br>Robin B.<br></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></li><li class="ygrps-yiv-644878115ygrps-yiv-582106175" id="ygrps-yiv-644878115ygrps-yiv-582106175wm:mid.1379184172549:455e201cda0aa86004" style="padding:8px 20px 7px;zoom:1;border-width:1px 0px 0px;"><div class="ygrps-yiv-644878115ygrps-yiv-582106175" style="zoom:1;"><div class="ygrps-yiv-644878115ygrps-yiv-582106175" style="zoom:1;overflow:hidden;"><div class="ygrps-yiv-644878115ygrps-yiv-582106175"><div class="ygrps-yiv-644878115ygrps-yiv-582106175" id="ygrps-yiv-644878115ygrps-yiv-582106175mid.1379184172549:455e201cda0aa86004"><div class="ygrps-yiv-644878115ygrps-yiv-582106175" style="zoom:1;"><div class="ygrps-yiv-644878115ygrps-yiv-582106175" style="direction:ltr;font-size:13px;line-height:1.38;margin-right:50px;">
