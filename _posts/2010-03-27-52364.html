<div id="ygrps-yiv-753454389">This is my first post after having been a reader only for the last few months.  I have a middle son 6yrs. who will often through objects at other family members, especially his older brother 8yrs., when he gets mad.  It is usually a result of some form of teasing, name calling or wildness that has gotten out of control.  I try and always listen to their play to catch things before they reach that level but we have a big yard and it can be difficult to always be there.  I have talked to the older brother about not pushing to the point where his younger brother explodes and I tried a code word they could use to try and avoid those situations. That worked for a while but I feel like I am not getting to the root of what is happening for the middle son.  I try and validate his angry feelings and talk to him about other options but I think when he gets fired up he sees revenge as the most satifying one to him.  I am concerned that he will hurt someone as he will through rocks and heavy objects.  He really hates it when I suggest to breath, maybe I don&#39;t do it in the right way?  This is not really typical of our family though my husband is quicker to anger than I.  Hoping for some wisdom to help us past this to a better way of being from some more experienced mothers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-689497416">Deb Lewis recently wrote a wonderful post about spending more time with a child who was/is being destructive. I&#39;m gonna just rip it from the unschoolbasics archives and post it here: <br/>
<br/>
***My ds is 4 and he takes tools (real, toy, knives, whatever he can <br/>
find <br/>
that he can alter<br/>
something with) and digs, cuts, scrapes <br/>
into one of the windowsills and one <br/>
particular<br/>
part of the living room wall.***<br/>
<br/>
Where are you when he digs the windowsills or <br/>
walls?<br/>
If you know he&#39;s likely to do it (because he&#39;s done it before) you should be <br/>
with him.<br/>
<br/>
***For the most part he&#39;ll stop <br/>
when redirected, or told<br/>
why it&#39;s not ok. ***<br/>
<br/>
But he does it <br/>
again? After you told him why it&#39;s not ok?<br/>
He needs you with him <br/>
more, then.<br/>
<br/>
***he will hit or throw things at his sister when she doesn&#39;t want to play <br/>
with<br/>
him. He won&#39;t be dissuaded by our <br/>
attempts to get him focused on something<br/>
else, playing with dh or me, helping us with something***<br/>
<br/>
It seems like he needs more direct <br/>
attention from you so that he&#39;s not left <br/>
to dig walls or depend on <br/>
his sister to be his play mate.<br/>
<br/>
Busy moms sometimes forget how <br/>
much four year olds still need attention. <br/>
They can seem so mature <br/>
about so many things - able to get snacks and <br/>
drinks, able to work <br/>
the TV and DVR and computer.  But they really need mom <br/>
attention.   <br/>
If you are doing housework or on the computer while he&#39;s doing <br/>
his <br/>
own thing, he&#39;s on his own too much.    Play with him a lot while his <br/>
sister is in school.   Get out and do things together, even if that&#39;s just <br/>
digging a big hole in the garden.  Be right with him, be his companion. <br/>
Helping him find appropriate things to bang up and destroy is fine but it <br/>
has to come with the attention and companionship he&#39;s craving or it won&#39;t <br/>
be <br/>
enough.<br/>
<br/>
If being destructive is his outlet for feelings of frustration or loneliness <br/>
you can change that.  If he has <br/>
opportunity to destroy appropriate things <br/>
but still feels frustrated or lonely, he might find other, possibly more <br/>
destructive outlets.  Don&#39;t expect the act of destruction to fulfill him. <br/>
*You* are the <br/>
only thing that can fulfill him.   Your time, your attention.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve said he&#39;s not polite, he&#39;s destructive and he&#39;s hurting his sister, <br/>
you should be with him all the time.  If that means leaving housework until <br/>
your partner gets home, or waiting to get on the computer until <br/>
he&#39;s asleep, <br/>
then that&#39;s what it means right now.  He&#39;s growing and <br/>
changing and won&#39;t be <br/>
four forever.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
So, that&#39;s what I&#39;d say, spend more time with your 6 year old son. Don&#39;t expect your 8 year old to be his playmate. Be present a lot, a lot more.<br/>

I am not more experienced, my oldest(James) is 8 as well but I see the behaviors you described in my kids.  My middle son (Ben) is 7 and out of all my kids he is the quickest to lash out.. especially at James. One thing I have been thinking about this week is that perhaps I am ignoring something that James is communicating because he is not physically violent and always focusing more on the violence of Ben.  I spend ALOT of time with Ben cause I feel he needs that attention and dont think about how the teasing, pushing the limits, behavior James sometimes exhibits is also his way of communicating frustration with his brother and jealousy etc.. I am trying to look at what both kids are trying to communicate with their behaviors and not just focus on the behavior.</div>

your son find in those books?<br/>
<br/>
Leave the situation.<br/>
Go to your room and read.<br/>
<br/>
Breathing helped us, but somehow we figured out a way to get Kirby&#39;s  <br/>
attention and help him breath to be calmer.<br/>
<br/>
What other things might a family put on a list as a reminder that  <br/>
there are options?<br/>
Even a child who can&#39;t read might be helped by a list of possible  <br/>
responses to fury, if the parents or someone could help him remember  <br/>
there were choices.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1637558924">-=- I have talked to the older brother about not pushing to the point  <br/>
where his younger brother explodes.-=-<br/>
<br/>
That sounds as though you&#39;re giving him permission to push some, just  <br/>
not to the point of explosion.<br/>
If he&#39;s being mean or teasing at all, that needs to stop, because your  <br/>
middle son needs to feel safe and at peace in his own home, in his own  <br/>
yard.<br/>
<br/>
But it can&#39;t be his brother&#39;s responsibility to see to his peace,  <br/>
though it should be the parents&#39; responsibility to guard against  <br/>
bullying or harrassment.<br/>
<br/>
I used to say &quot;It&#39;s only playing if everyone is playing.&quot;   It&#39;s not  <br/>
okay for one to say &quot;I was only playing&quot; if the other one was saying  <br/>
&quot;Stop.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=- I tried a code word they could use to try and avoid those  <br/>
situations. That worked for a while but I feel like I am not getting  <br/>

<br/>
I agree with the advice of being there more.  Maybe find more  <br/>
opportunities for each child to be alone with you and maybe you&#39;ll  <br/>
learn more that way.<br/>

together, right? Which is why you get a bit complacent and then they erupt?<br/>
<br/>
I had three girls who played together really happily much of the time, <br/>
but the middle one would sometimes explode in anger. I now know, after <br/>
years of trial and error, the solution. More separate time! The more <br/>
time they are separated, the more they enjoy the time they have to play <br/>
together. Find reasons to take one with you when you go out. Set up play <br/>
dates for just one. Invite a friend over for one and do something <br/>
special with the others. And so on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-50305377">I&#39;m wondering if the anger explosions are an escalation of his behavior when angry or a continuation.  I&#39;m wondering because 6 is a big time for boys going through a big testosterone surge, and he may be having bigger reactions than he did before.  We went through that with my son, and I felt like someone else was inhabiting his body for that year.  At the time it was scary, so I started researching--that answer fit what was happening.  That&#39;s not all to say that you still don&#39;t up your parenting skills to help the situation, but knowing the cause helped me figure out what direction to go in.<br/>
<br/>
When my youngest was physically expressive toward her older brother (like my euphemism? &lt;g&gt;), I figured out that she was feeling the power imbalance between them and making up for it the only way she knew how.  He would play the mental superiority card, and she would get physical.  Oh boy--when she figured out that licking him sent him over the edge, that was heaven for her!  So I helped him to see why she was doing these things--he really didn&#39;t know.  And then she got older, and stuff just got better between them.  It&#39;s still the biggest source of their fights, though, when they fight--he has plowed over the top of her in some way that is sometimes unconscious to him, and she fights back in a more explosive, obvious way.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have three, but I always hear about the middle child feeling a lack of power--so maybe if you can look at it that way, through his eyes, things might become more clear.<br/>

But she needs a few minutes, up to 15 or 20 sometimes, in order to let her system settle back down enough to talk.  I remember Sandra talking about that here--that people have different chemistry around anger, and that some people take longer than others.  That way of looking at it was VERY helpful around my house, because my son--and my daughter&#39;s best friend--are more ready to talk right away, and needed to understand that not everyone is.<br/>
<br/>
After that all got sorted out, sometimes she&#39;ll come bouncing back out of her room after a few minutes alone, totally ready to resume play--anger gone.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My son is a talker, but we&#39;ve found over the years that the times when he&#39;s angry, and feeling the most compelled to talk, are the times that he SHOULDN&#39;T talk to the person he&#39;s angry with.  He can talk to me until he&#39;s ready, calmer inside.  <br/>
<br/>
He watched that play out with another teenage boy who didn&#39;t take the time to calm down.  His mother was angry too, and it was a disaster, and they came out looking foolish to everyone else around--that was HUGE for my son, and when things really turned around for him.<br/>

think parents really often have expectations that their kids will spend <br/>
lots and lots of time together, getting along perfectly. But most of US <br/>
wouldn&#39;t want to spend THAT much time with just one or two other people, <br/>
either. Day after day, hour after hour. It is a lot - even if we love <br/>
the other person. And kids will go through stages where they really <br/>
don&#39;t click that well or when one of the kids is really annoying the <br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
If you see this as all very normal and natural, it will make it easier <br/>
to accept and to help and support the kids. For kids who mostly like <br/>
each other and like to do a lot of stuff together, just separating them <br/>
a bit can make a HUGE difference. For kids who are being annoyed and <br/>
irritated by one of the others, separating them can give them the <br/>
greatly-needed break so that they have more self-control when they are <br/>
together.<br/>

This is my first post after having been a reader only for the last few months.  I have a middle son 6yrs. who will often through objects at other family members, especially his older brother 8yrs., when he gets mad.  It is usually a result of some form of teasing, name calling or wildness that has gotten out of control. <br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
So if you know how it starts, think more about how to stop it.  What starts the teasing?  Different ability levels, hunger, boredom?  Try to stop it before this stage.  My ds Eli can be explosive.  I read The Explosive Child http://http://www.amazon.com/Explosive-Child-Understanding-Frustrated-Chronically/dp/0061906190/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1269742918&sr=8-1.  One of the best ideas in the book for me was the idea that anger often stems from a few situations.  In our house it is losing things (especially the remote), things not working the way they should, and rough play(once it starts he has a lot of trouble stopping).  When the situations are predictable, it is much easier to head off blow ups.  Watch for a few days and see if there is a discerniblepattern.  I was able to predict and problem solve much easier once I knew where most of the anger was coming from.<br/>
<br/>
******<br/>
I try and validate his angry feelings and talk to him about other options but I think when he gets fired up he sees revenge as the most satifying one to him. <br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
Revenge is exactly what Eli looks for when he gets mad at his brother.  So I made the &quot;Get Sam&quot; game.  When Eli gets mad at Sam (younger ds) I take him with me to the bedroom.  Eli stands on one end of the room and I sit on the end of the bed.  We pretend the wall behind me is Sam.  Eli&#39;s objective to get past me and tag the wall.  That counts as hitting Sam.  I have to try and stop him.  Amazingly this works for him.  He feels like he hit Sam, it is not nearly as hard on me as trying to physically restrain Eli, and Sam does not have to be any part of it.  In the past we have tried separation, talking, breathing, spinning on a hanging ladder, and hitting a pillow.  The game is the only thing that really seemed to work for him.  I think he gets out some physical aggression, gets some time with me, takes a break from the situation, and at the same time can be mad for a bit.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1549874982">~~~What other things might a family put on a list as a reminder that there <br/>
are options? Even a child who can&#39;t read might be helped by a list of <br/>
possible responses to fury, if the parents or someone could help him <br/>
remember there were choices.~~<br/>
<br/>
If it is night-time, Sorscha goes outside and jumps on the trampoline.  If <br/>
it&#39;s early enough in the evening, she&#39;ll howl.  She says there is something <br/>
about the night air that centers her and releases her anger.<br/>
<br/>
If it is daytime, she will also go outside, jump on the trampoline and howl. <br/>
Lately, she&#39;s been turning on her Japanese music and acting out her <br/>
emotions.<br/>
<br/>
If we are not at home, she likes to go sit in our Bubble Van and read or <br/>
play her DS.<br/>
<br/>
She has found that she needs to be alone when she is angry.  This is a huge <br/>
step because she used to lash out at me or others (she just couldn&#39;t seem to <br/>
stop herself ) and would feel horrible afterwards.  It&#39;s taken me a very <br/>
long time to help her navigate these moments and there are still times when <br/>
I just can&#39;t get her out of a situation soon enough.  But we&#39;re working <br/>
together, step by step, breath by breath, jump by jump, howl by howl and <br/>
life is getting easier because of our bond, trust, and patience with one <br/>
another.<br/>
