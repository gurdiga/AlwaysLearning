I had a folklore professor who was really old in the 70&#39;s already, and he had <br/>
a collection of 78s (really old phonograph records, for the youngsters in the <br/>
readership &lt;g&gt;) of collected folklore and one was a woman telling a story <br/>
about Sean the Giantkiller or some such.   He asked us what we could tell about <br/>
it just from the first few lines and my hand shot up (because it was prone to <br/>
do so), but this one was GOOD, and very memorable for me.   She was pronouncing <br/>
Sean as the word for already having looked:   &quot;Seen.&quot;      I said &quot;She <br/>
learned it from a book.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Right.     So she didn&#39;t have that one from the oral tradition, but had <br/>
jumpstarted from a written source.<br/>
<br/>
I like this modern commentary on English, but when I look at it I really do <br/>
appreciate how meaning is conveyed so much by the appearance of the words, in <br/>
English:<br/>
<br/>
Ode to the Spell Checker!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Eye halve a spelling chequer<br/>
It came with my pea sea<br/>
It plainly marques four my revue<br/>
Miss steaks eye kin knot sea.<br/>
<br/>
Eye strike a key and type a word<br/>
And weight four it two say<br/>
Weather eye am wrong oar write<br/>
It shows me strait a weigh.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as a mist ache is maid<br/>
It nose bee fore two long<br/>
And eye can put the error rite<br/>
Its rare lea ever wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Eye have run this poem threw it<br/>
I am shore your pleased two no<br/>
Its letter perfect awl the weigh<br/>
My chequer tolled me sew.<br/>
<br/>
(anonymous, I guess--an e-mail thing)<br/>
<br/>
It also explains why &quot;bad spelling&quot; (wrong word choice) is so irritating to <br/>
visual readers.   It provides wrong information.   <br/>
<br/>
Kirby, the other day, was all het up about there being an apostrophe in <br/>
Seasons Greetings on the window at the pizza place where he works.   Seasons <br/>
Greeting&#39;s.     He really wanted it scraped off, but the management wasn&#39;t <br/>
concerned.    Kirby has never had a spelling lessons, just a few spelling <br/>
conversations.    <br/>
