<div id="ygrps-yiv-198575629"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;My Num Lock is on the 10-key portion of the keyboard<br/>
&gt;and when pushed, allows me to use the numbers on<br/>
&gt;those keys instead of what is written on the bottom<br/>
&gt;of each numbered key: Home or End, PgUp, arrows,<br/>
&gt;etc.  Hope that is clear<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I almost always have my numlock on, because I used to<br/>
do a lot of scretarial and administrative work and I<br/>
am very familiar with a ten key.  I perfer using the<br/>
ten key pad whenever I need to use numbers on the<br/>
computer.  Those keys across the top of my keyboard<br/>
might as well not have any numbers on them, because I<br/>
only use them for the symbols.<br/>
