<div id="ygrps-yiv-631396046">My son was talking this morning about Bush and the potential war with Iraq <br/>
and other issues it was just so fascinating to me to hear him think.  He is <br/>
someone who thinks everything out loud.  He would be talking about an issue.  <br/>
Doesn&#39;t really matter, here, what his point of view is or what the subject <br/>
is. I would present the counter argument.  Or just something to add to the <br/>
mix for him to think about.  He would pause for a minute to think about that <br/>
and then start thinking out loud again.  It is just so wonderful to see him <br/>
processing all the information and formulating his own ideas and opinions no <br/>
matter what my opinion on the subject might be.  Very political and <br/>
fascinating.<br/>
