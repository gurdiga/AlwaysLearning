<div id="ygrps-yiv-876451927">Hello Everyone!<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to share with this list an afternoon that we spent last week at the home of fellow unschoolers.  I&#39;m hoping that people will either appreciate it as one of those &quot;day in the life of&quot; posts...or new people may get something out of it.<br/>
<br/>
I took my two boys over to the home of friends...a boy and girl.  The other mom and I had discussed ahead of time what video games would be good for them to rent now that all of the kids are familiar with GameCube games.  The kids had several GameCube multi-player games to play and some PS2 eyetoy games.  The eye toy was something my kids hadn&#39;t done before so I thought they would be very intrigued by that.  Us moms thought...oh this will be so nice...the kids will just play endless hours of video games and we can just visit.  HAHA!<br/>
<br/>
These kids...all of which have open and unlimited access to video games probably played them for less than an hour during the 4 hours we were there.  They went through each game, spending no more than a few minutes on each and then wanted to go outside and run around and play in the yard.  Then it was inside for role/fantasy play.<br/>
<br/>
At some point one of my boys asked me for a snack.  So we asked all the kids if they wanted any.  (I had brought some store-bought snack cake thingies.)  My oldest son didn&#39;t even want one right then, the rest of the kids wanted one...but nobody finished one.  They each ate about 1/2 of their cake and that was enough...off to play.<br/>
<br/>
The other mom and I just laughed about it.  Here were 4 kids with no limits or issues about video games or food and they couldn&#39;t have cared less about obsessing over either one.  Life is good!<br/>
<br/>
