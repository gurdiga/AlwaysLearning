<div id="ygrps-yiv-942636122">All this talk about weather reminds me.... my daughter has been watching &quot;Atmospheres&quot; on The Weather Channel lately....I think they have a schedule of it on their web site: www.weather.com<br/>
<br/>
  We&#39;re kind of a &quot;TV family&quot; and have it on alot anyway (even when we&#39;re doing other things, I&#39;m the kind of person who likes it on just for noise), so I figure if she&#39;s watching something that&#39;s interesting to her she&#39;ll soak more of it in.... and she really seems to like it.  Obviously, it&#39;s about weather...but quite often it&#39;s about severe weather...which I think holds her ( and my) interest a little more...... I guess we&#39;re a little nerdy, but we really enjoy it. ;-)<br/>
  Anyway ... I thought maybe I&#39;d pass that idea along...<br/>
