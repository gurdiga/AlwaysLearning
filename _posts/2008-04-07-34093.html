<div id="ygrps-yiv-683931116">We saw Nim&#39;s Island this weekend, and were very pleasantly surprised to find that the main <br/>
character is an unschooled child.  She calls it &quot;islandschooled.&quot;  It was a pretty good movie--<br/>
both kids loved it, and loved seeing an unschooled child as a main character instead of <br/>
another movie about children constantly referencing school.<br/>
