<div id="ygrps-yiv-2060674084">Yes, it is very dry here.  The kids weren&#39;t actually swimming that  <br/>
much today, because the pool wasn&#39;t heated and is probably on 60  <br/>
degrees!  But the water was evaporating quickly on the patio/pool  <br/>
deck.  Funny, dry has been a topic of mine lately.  Here is a recent  <br/>
journal entry for me out here in the desert:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Ode to Reptiles:<br/>
I am turning into a lizard.  Face cream, eye cream, face cream with  <br/>
SPF, lip moisturizer, body lotion, body oil, medicated lotion:  I  <br/>
have them all.  I have used them all.  Nothing is working.  I  <br/>
couldnï¿½t even pull on my socks yesterday because my heels are so dry  <br/>
and frayed.  I am starting to look like all the other living things  <br/>
in the desert around here:  scaly and prickly.  Drink more water you  <br/>
say?  I am drinking so much water that I am in the bathroom every 30  <br/>
minutes.  But, I suppose that gives me another opportunity to apply  <br/>
lotion.<br/>
I have a desert booger stuck in my nose also.  I canï¿½t see it, but I  <br/>
know it is there!  A once moist blob of mucus has dehydrated to the  <br/>
point it has the likeness of charcoal; stuck in my nose.  I am afraid  <br/>
surgery is my only option at this point.<br/>
I draped a washed sheet over our outdoor chairs to dry in the sun.   <br/>
It was dry as soon as I turned around and reached the door.  The  <br/>
water was visible as it rapidly evaporated.  I think we actually  <br/>
created a cloud.  Maybe if everyone dried their clothes outside on a  <br/>
line, it wouldnï¿½t be so dry out here.  There would be clouds of  <br/>
laundered moisture everywhere. &quot;<br/>

Springs and Palm Desert.  She discovered a line of products that  <br/>
actually worked, but the reason they worked is they are oil-based.  If  <br/>
you were fighting zits with non-oily stuff in the past, it may be time  <br/>
to switch.  Also, whatever you apply, put it on while your skin is  <br/>
still wet from your shower; straight baby oil would be good, or Avon&#39;s  <br/>
Skin So Soft.  When you get ready for bed, coat your feet in Vaseline,  <br/>
pull some comfortable socks over them, and if you can, do the same for  <br/>
your hands with cotton gloves.  I swear, the Vaseline on the hands  <br/>
thing will cure your dry, cracked skin and nails overnight.<br/>
<br/>
Another hand care tip I brought up during the dish-washing thread:  <br/>
Scrub olive oil and salt all over your hands, rinse and dry, then coat  <br/>
with a heavy cream like Nivea or Udder Balm, cover with rubber gloves,  <br/>
then hand wash the dishes.  This is how someone who works with horses  <br/>
can clean and soften hands enough to also embroider with silk.<br/>

I wash my face with a blend of Honey and apple cidar vinegar- about 1/3 C to 1 Tbsp. (making a decent consistency)  This seems to help with some of the dryness.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I try to do that with everything.  I ask or tell someone what I want <br/>
rather than ask or tell what I don&#39;t want.<br/>
<br/>
That was a really hard habit to break, it took lots of prethougt.  For <br/>
a long time I would say &quot;don&#39;t run&quot; then I would rethink that <br/>
emmediately and say &quot;walk&quot;.  I did that often enough where telling <br/>
someone to &quot;walk&quot; started coming first.<br/>
<br/>
That is one of those mindshift things that unschoolers talk about.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-617831933">Yes, Sandra, that is just where I was yesterday.  We have spent the  <br/>
last several years questioning everything.  For us, this has gone  <br/>
beyond just the unschooling area as well.  Sometimes we feel like a  <br/>
bunch of three year olds with the never-ending &quot;WHY???&quot;.  Why do we  <br/>
have to send our children to school?  Why do our kids need to be in  <br/>
so many activities?  Why do we have to live in a 4br/2.5ba house?   <br/>
Why do we have to have a mortgage?  Why do we have to have a 401k?   <br/>
Why do we have to visit our family on holidays?  What exactly defines  <br/>
success?  Why can&#39;t my kids climb on those rocks?  I feel like we  <br/>
have really pulled back and put almost everything in our lives to the  <br/>
question test.  There are some very valid answers for many of the  <br/>
questions and we realized that we were doing the best thing all  <br/>
along, but in lots of the questions, we realized there was a better  <br/>
way, but it required purposeful thought and stepping outside of &quot;the  <br/>
box&quot;.  I have found it to be quite transformative and an excellent  <br/>
way to expand my mind and thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
So yesterday, for me to keep on saying &quot;don&#39;t run&quot; just didn&#39;t seem  <br/>
right.  I agree that &quot;walk&quot; is a much better use of my words.  But I  <br/>
began questioning the &quot;why&quot;.  Is there really more danger at a pool  <br/>
than other concrete places or was it just one of those &quot;pool rule&quot;  <br/>
things.  And I got a very great answer:  slippery when wet.<br/>
<br/>
I want to protect my children from any harm, but realize there is a  <br/>
certain amount of physical knowledge one can only learn through  <br/>
experience.  And yes, my youngest has gotten concrete scrapes before,  <br/>
but that didn&#39;t seem to be in his memory yesterday.  I don&#39;t mean the  <br/>
sick sort of &quot;oh yeah, well that will teach you to run on concrete&quot;  <br/>
type of parenting, but the kind that allows children to push their  <br/>
own physical boundaries to see what they are capable of.  I find  <br/>
myself often split between wanting to shout &quot;wait, don&#39;t do that, you  <br/>
are going to get hurt&quot; and whispering under my breath, &quot;yes, go  <br/>
ahead, you can do it, I know you can&quot;.  Climbing on rocks and  <br/>
swimming in the ocean come immediately to mind.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; But now you&#39;re looking at how to enable your kids to do more, and I<br/>
&gt; think the thought process can include reviewing every rule ever<br/>
&gt; learned non-analytically.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And maybe you&#39;re getting older. My husband is disturbed by getting<br/>
&gt; older. I&#39;m fine with it. What I&#39;m losing is spelling. I used to<br/>
&gt; spell very easily. Now I have to think and look things up<br/>
&gt; sometimes. I&#39;m forgetting song lyrics a little bit. Not tunes yet.<br/>
&gt; If that comes I might be grumpy too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1258465810">Yes, I will do the neti pot.  I haven&#39;t used it in about 2 weeks,  <br/>
just before we got to the desert.  I use it for well-care and guess I  <br/>
never thought of using it to help moisturize my nasal passage.  I  <br/>
have always lived on the east coast and moisture has never been a  <br/>
problem there!<br/>

&gt; You could try nasal irrigation with a neti pot, as a way to loosen<br/>
&gt; things up (and maybe avoid surgery?). I started using one as part of<br/>
&gt; an Ayurvedic routine, and it&#39;s really helped with my allergies. It can<br/>
&gt; take some patience to clear your sinuses, but it might be worth a try.<br/>
&gt; You can google how-to&#39;s and where to buy a neti pot, but here&#39;s an<br/>

<br/>
WHOA.  Keep the 401k.<br/>
And get more life insurance.  Seriously.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Yes.  And &quot;because I said so&quot; was never worth a damn, as reasons go,  <br/>
except it was often backed up by threat of (or delivery of) spankings.<br/>
<br/>
So those people who decide their new rules will be the opposite of  <br/>
mom&#39;s old rules are<br/>
<br/>
1) not thinking clearly, and<br/>
<br/>
2) still letting mom run their lives, only in the reactionary/ <br/>
negative way.<br/>
