<div id="ygrps-yiv-1576326171">I&#39;ve just finished a long questionnaire on my life as a  <br/>
homeschooler.  Some of it might be published in a book by Mary  <br/>
Griffith, or maybe not, but I thought this answer might be good for  <br/>
this list.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
4d. What were the most difficult aspects of homeschooling? What were  <br/>
the most fun or interesting parts?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes other kids said things that made my kids worry a bit.  It  <br/>
was easily refuted, and in retrospect now they remember and they see  <br/>
that in every case those kids are less content and less  <br/>
&quot;successful&quot; (at this point in time) than they are.  This might not  <br/>
remain true, as maybe fifteen or years out &quot;success&quot; will look like  <br/>
master&#39;s degrees and such for some of them, but we don&#39;t know that  <br/>
our kids won&#39;t move that direction too.  And if they do it will be  <br/>
from choice and joy, not from &quot;it&#39;s time to go to college, just go;  <br/>
you&#39;re going.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That leapfrog effect has been seen in many aspects of life.  When  <br/>
they were eight, they felt behind.  When they were 13, they felt  <br/>
ahead, when they were 16, they felt behind.  When they&#39;re 18 they  <br/>
feel ahead.  So if at 30 they feel &quot;behind,&quot; I wouldn&#39;t be at all  <br/>
surprised if at 40, they feel ahead again, as others become  <br/>
disillusioned with careers they chose too soon, for reasons of  <br/>
prestige or income level.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All cases will vary I&#39;m sure, and change as the years pass, but the  <br/>
fears they had when other seven year olds would assure them they  <br/>
would never have jobs when they grew up, or would never learn to  <br/>
read, are distant and amusing memories.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The most fun and interesting parts have been the sparkle of  <br/>
discovering new connections.  A game, a comedy routine, a poem, a  <br/>
truck, a map�all can fold and roll together to create a depth and  <br/>
breadth of knowledge school never dreamed of.  And when those  <br/>
lightbulb moments are shared with others in the family it adds to our  <br/>
shared experiences and our relationships.<br/>
