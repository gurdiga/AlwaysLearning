<div id="ygrps-yiv-621264951">Today in Albuquerque at my house:<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t see the mountains at all, and for anyone who has been to my house, <br/>
that&#39;s a big thing not to see.<br/>
<br/>
For those who haven&#39;t been to my house but know Albuquerque, I&#39;m SE of <br/>
Candelaria and Juan Tabo and have upstairs windows facing the Sandias.  <br/>
They&#39;re gone.  It looks like a snow day but it smells like a camp fire is <br/>
upwind.   <br/>
<br/>
The upwind &quot;campfire&quot; is 200 miles or so away, but high winds are carrying <br/>
the smoke east, and several factors involving the Rio Grande Valley are <br/>
pulling it down to sit on us.<br/>
<br/>
For any of you with more direct fire danger this week, I wish I were close <br/>
enough to offer to let you stay with us, or to help you with whatever needed <br/>
to be done for your kids to be distracted and happier during the wait to see <br/>
which houses survive.<br/>
<br/>
People we knew were affected by the Los Alamos fire a couple of years ago.  <br/>
It&#39;s overwhelming.<br/>

acres.  Too close for comfort!<br/>
