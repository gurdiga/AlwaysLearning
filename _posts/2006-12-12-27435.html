<div id="ygrps-yiv-658571885">Yeah, I need Christmas money more than I thought I would.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you need One More Christmas gift to give away, and maybe  <br/>
Thinking Sticks or a copy of Moving a Puddle would work.  Maybe  <br/>
there&#39;s someone who helped you when your kids were younger, or a  <br/>
relative with a toddler, or a new unschooling family in your life, or  <br/>
a support group lending library...<br/>

If you use my web site lots and lots and if you would take me to  <br/>
lunch if I were in your town but you think you&#39;ll just send me the  <br/>
price of a turkey sandwich as a Christmas gift, that would be fun.   <br/>
My paypal address is my regular address, which is probably also on  <br/>
all of those pages.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I also love Christmas cards lots, and my address is on one or all of  <br/>
those pages above.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
