<div id="ygrps-yiv-61165100">Hi all. I am planning athe annual homeschool/unschool valentine<br/>
exchange again this year. This will be the 5th year and  It grew so<br/>
large last year that I had my hands full<br/>
trying to get the list organized, so we haave earlier deadlines!<br/>
Please note the email address to send your info to....do nopt just<br/>
relply to this post!<br/>
<br/>
Here is how it works:<br/>
<br/>
You submit your name, childrens names and ages, email address, and<br/>
snail mail address to me.<br/>
<br/>
I place all the names on lists of about 20 to 25 families per list .<br/>
<br/>
You will be emailed only one list with your family on and these are<br/>
the folks you will exchange with. There will be several lists, so a<br/>
friend or aquaintance may not be on your list,,please don&#39;t be<br/>
alarmed..they will be on another.<br/>
<br/>
Then you eihter make or have the children sign store bought cards<br/>
for each child on your list(sometimes there will be more than one<br/>
child in a family and I sugest that you do a card for each and olace<br/>
in a large envelope the small cards and envelopes addressed to each<br/>
child then mail the large envvelope..this helps with postage..and<br/>
eeach child stiil feels special.<br/>
<br/>
Along with the card, please include some info,even if it is a small<br/>
amount about the place where you live, this way each child will get<br/>
a mini geography lesson as well!Info like size of<br/>
town,city....climate, whether you live in country or city, what your<br/>
family does for a living, etc....be creative if you want. But<br/>
remember, some families can&#39;t complete a large amonount of writtne<br/>
things and some can...<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes parents get mapps and place a star where the cards come<br/>
from..you can easily print one fromthe internet and the kids couyld<br/>
even color it!<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested, please email this info to<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:homeschoolexchange@...">homeschoolexchange@...</a> by January 15th so that I can compile<br/>
the list and email yours to you..hopefull by the 31st of Jan.<br/>
<br/>
