 </span></blockquote>Oh, I confess. For all my bravado, I&#39;ve never done acid either. Or shrooms. <br/>
Tried pot once after college and almost choked on the smoke. And I went to a <br/>
hippy college where there were plenty of drugs. <br/>
<br/>
In Junior high I even tried to start an anti-drug group. Someone once <br/>
described me as being like &quot;Someone who&#39;d Lost a Friend to drugs.&quot; (This was <br/>
not said in a loving, compassionate tone.) My goodness, what a good girl I <br/>
was! <br/>
<br/>
Now, of course, I see the anti-pot commercials on tv (Gee...who <br/>
knew...marijauna will make your 14 year old get pregnant!) and see the <br/>
results of the &quot;drug war,&quot; and I&#39;ve lightened up considerably. Everytime I <br/>
see one of them I just want to offer my kid a joint.<br/>
<br/>
(No, not really, in case you managed to miss that I&#39;m kidding. Put the phone <br/>
down. Calling Child Protective will really not help anything.)<br/>
