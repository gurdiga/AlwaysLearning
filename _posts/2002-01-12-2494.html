&lt;&lt; I mean, would we say &quot;as a gesture of respect<br/>

<br/>
your body (except for one hole in each ear)<br/>
<br/>
and all tatoos.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, in a way and under certain circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
At a formal wedding, tattoos showing through the lace on bridesmaids could be <br/>
problematical.  <br/>

I don&#39;t want to see anyone&#39;s below-the-waist holes in ANY hotel (unless we&#39;re <br/>
in a room alone with the door locked, consenting adults and all that).   <br/>
Picking noses and cleaning ears in public isn&#39;t politely done.  Chewing with <br/>
one&#39;s mouth open (gum or food) is considered rude.<br/>
<br/>
Breastfeeding doesn&#39;t involve a hole, though does it!?  But it does, <br/>
absolutely, involve a part of the body which is covered in our culture, by <br/>
tradition and law.  If women can&#39;t nurse discreetly, they could find <br/>
themselves relegated (as they have been in the past) to bathrooms, or women&#39;s <br/>
lounges, where taking clothes off is more okay.  <br/>
<br/>
*I* think breastfeeding in public is way better than in a toilet, absolutely. <br/>
 But that doesn&#39;t mean I think modesty is asking too much.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1655264873">Ok, this is good.  I agree with what you say.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I nurse modestly because I want<br/>
others to see that it can be done, not<br/>
because I dont&#39; want to offend people.  I<br/>
think that if a soon to be mom or her husband<br/>
or MIL or mother or someone saw me nursing<br/>
with it all hanging out, they might think<br/>
&quot;I&#39;ll never be able to nurse if I have to<br/>
nurse like that, so I just won&#39;t try, or  I<br/>
won&#39;t nurse in public, or I&#39;ll pump and give<br/>
pumped milk in public in a bottle, or formula<br/>
in public, etc.&quot;  But if they see me nursing<br/>
discreetly, then maybe they will say &quot;hmm,<br/>
that mom is nursing and I dind&#39;t even know it<br/>
until I got close, no one can see a thing,<br/>
maybe I can nurse like that too...&#39;<br/>
<br/>
But to be honest, it has nothing to do with<br/>
being worried about being offensive to<br/>
someone else.  I realized when I was going<br/>
out with my husband that I can&#39;t worry about<br/>
other&#39;s people&#39;s feelings. I can try not to<br/>
offend people, but I&#39;ll only take it so far.<br/>
Some people in this crazy world are offended<br/>
just by us going out in public together,<br/>
because he is black and I am white.  Some<br/>
people are offended (like my uncle, who is a<br/>
pediatric doctor) when I nurse in public, no<br/>
matter how discreet I am.  I personally don&#39;t<br/>
care about their offense.<br/>
<br/>
But really, I was thinking this statement was<br/>
like me telling Lexie to &quot;be careful&quot; when<br/>
she&#39;s pooring the milk or crossing the<br/>
street.  Of course she&#39;s careful, why woudl<br/>
she not be.  it&#39;s more like it&#39;s belittling.<br/>
