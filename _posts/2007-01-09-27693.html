<div id="ygrps-yiv-78499895">You know, I think that getting really clear about my own values,<br/>
whilst being aware that other value systems exist, having some<br/>
awareness of the lived reality of different ways of being *and*<br/>
sharing all that with my child without imposing a one right way is<br/>
what I find most useful. <br/>
<br/>
I have always allowed, and continue to allow for the possibility that<br/>
my own child may grow to choose to live quite differently to what<br/>
feels right to me. <br/>
<br/>
If I am clear about living by principles rather than rules<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unschooling.info/articles/article4.htm,">http://www.unschooling.info/articles/article4.htm,</a> and am not valuing<br/>
more accepted mainstream ways of living<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unschooling.info/articles/article10.htm">http://www.unschooling.info/articles/article10.htm</a> over other ways of<br/>
being I believe equally valuable, then my child has real freedom to<br/>
choose the course of her life, to identify, know and live by the<br/>
lights that are her own.<br/>
<br/>
I do understand the difficulty of communicating this to folks whose<br/>
views are far from our own. I find short, pointful questions that<br/>
should provoke thought in the mind of the querent the most useful<br/>
tool. Some people will never get me, and that just has to be okay,<br/>
because I do have firm foundations for my choices and beliefs and<br/>
sometimes another&#39;s beliefs are too far from my own for either of us<br/>
to feel inclined or even able to forge deeper understanding. <br/>
