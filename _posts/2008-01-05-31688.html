<div id="ygrps-yiv-2079725503">Hello there<br/>
 <br/>
I am new to the concept of unschooling, but it excites me.  I am Mum to Jack 4, partner to Paul.  We live in a great village called Forest Row in East Sussex, UK.  Thought I would do a little intro as I&#39;ve been lurking for a very little while.<br/>
 <br/>
I guess I&#39;ve always resisted and questioned and challenged and pushed my own comfort zone.  We have attachment parented and I am now very attracted to unschooling for our son and for myself, and scared too.  Especially about how to manage my (big) fear that comes up around telling my parents/siblings that Jack is not going to go to school.  He does a couple of mornings at a Steiner Kindergarden at the moment and I am trying to get back into a little working from home for myself.  I managed to push homeschooling/unschooling to the back of my mind but it&#39;s come up again even bigger!<br/>
 <br/>
I am working on living magically, trusting that the money will manifest that we require.  That I have enough energy, inspiration, courage, wisdom, to go with following this dream vision.<br/>
 <br/>
Um, so hello<br/>

<br/>
Instead of saying he&#39;s not going to school, maybe you could say  <br/>
you&#39;re going to wait a year and try something, and then if you try it  <br/>
a second year, you could say &quot;We&#39;re going to do this as long as it&#39;s  <br/>
working so well.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If parents think a situation is being carefully monitored and that  <br/>
it&#39;s probably temporary, they&#39;re less likely to be anxious.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-862128834">Actually there are a few folk on the unschooling blog ring who are in the UK. There is also an autonomous education yahoo group (I think it is AEUK) from the UK. I haven&#39;t read there for ages. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AEUK/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AEUK/</a> <br/>
<br/>
My experience is that there are more people on the unschooling end of the spectrum in the UK in the south than in the north, but almost no one who is actually unschooling. In and around Newcastle,when we lived in Sedgefield, near Stockton -on-Tees bullying or SEN were the main reasons for Home-educating. Not folks who were walking away from schooling, but folks for whom the school environment was not a welcoming experience. In Norfolk, where we live now, there are more people who are actively choosing not to put their children in school than who are choosing to remove them from school because of difficulties. <br/>
<br/>
We drive near Nottingham occasionally on our drive oop nort to see friends. <br/>

  Subject: [AlwaysLearning] Hello and introduction<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Hello there<br/>
<br/>
  I am new to the concept of unschooling, but it excites me. I am Mum to<br/>
Jack 4, partner to Paul. We live in a great village called Forest Row in<br/>
East Sussex, UK. Thought I would do a little intro as I&#39;ve been lurking for<br/>
a very little while.<br/>
<br/>
  I guess I&#39;ve always resisted and questioned and challenged and pushed my<br/>
own comfort zone. We have attachment parented and I am now very attracted to<br/>
unschooling for our son and for myself, and scared too. Especially about how<br/>
to manage my (big) fear that comes up around telling my parents/siblings<br/>
that Jack is not going to go to school. He does a couple of mornings at a<br/>
Steiner Kindergarden at the moment and I am trying to get back into a little<br/>
working from home for myself. I managed to push homeschooling/unschooling to<br/>
the back of my mind but it&#39;s come up again even bigger!<br/>
<br/>
  I am working on living magically, trusting that the money will manifest<br/>
that we require. That I have enough energy, inspiration, courage, wisdom, to<br/>
go with following this dream vision.<br/>
<br/>
  Um, so hello<br/>
  Sarah Charlton<br/>
<br/>

  -=-She does have a college degree and that was instrumental in landingher<br/>
the job. Her degree is in Recreation and Leisure Studies. SheLOVED her<br/>
degree program - felt like all the professors really thoughtlike<br/>
unschoolers - she&#39;d joke that she was majoring in unschooling -because they<br/>
SO understood that people really learn more from what areusually called<br/>
recreation or leisure activities than from conventionaleducational<br/>
activities.-=-Because the question was about &quot;non-collegiate paths that lead<br/>
to a fairly decent income&quot; I want to point out that Pam&#39;s daughter didn&#39;t<br/>
follow a path to prepare for college. She unschooled. She did cool stuff and<br/>
learned from it, she didn&#39;t learn in order to hope to do cool stuff in the<br/>
future.It&#39;s important to get away from &quot;paths,&quot; collegiate or otherwise.My<br/>
oldest is working a cool job he likes and his friends are envious and his<br/>
&quot;path&quot; was to start playing video games when he was a baby and never stop.<br/>
His hours aren&#39;t &quot;normal.&quot; His &quot;path&quot; to that was staying up as late as he<br/>
wanted and going to bed when he needed to.The exploration of the world can&#39;t<br/>
have an end goal in site, or people start making choices toward the goal<br/>
(college, money) instead of doing the interesting things to learn the<br/>
unusual things that will eventually lead them to people and places where<br/>
they will be welcomed and appreciated for what they have learned<br/>
naturally.Keep your life and your child&#39;s life busy and rich with real-world<br/>
experiences and activities. Get them cameras or leatherworking kits if they<br/>
want them. Don&#39;t be stingy about helping them attend a conference or a camp<br/>
where they&#39;ll meet other people interested in what they&#39;re interested in. If<br/>
they&#39;re playing Rock Band, spring for some extra songs and another guitar.If<br/>
you are dwelling in thoughts of the future, you&#39;ll miss January 4 and the<br/>
wonders you might have discovered.Sandra[Non-text portions of this message<br/>

She unschooled. She did cool&gt; stuff and learned from it, she didn&#39;t learn in<br/>
order to hope to do&gt; cool stuff in the future.This is so true. Even when she<br/>
took some classes at our local community college, she took them for their<br/>
own sake, and just took what really excited her. She wasn&#39;t taking them to<br/>
fulfill college requirements or anything like that. She took voice classes<br/>
and ceramics classes and photography and so on. We used them in the same way<br/>
others went to a dance studio or karate studio, etc. Not as &quot;going to<br/>
college.&quot; As she got up into usual college age, maybe 19 or 20, she decided<br/>
she wanted to get a degree and only then did she even look at what the<br/>
requirements were.Again, I recommend, &quot;The Uncollege Alternative,&quot;<br/>
especially as inspiration for those who feel uncomfortable about not being<br/>
on some sort of college-prep path. As a college professor, I&#39;m really firmly<br/>
convinced that most young adults would benefit much much more from college,<br/>
anyway, if they would go off and do things other than college at least for a<br/>
while, first.-pam[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>

<br/>
I vaguely remember Forest Row from when I lived in Sussex in the <br/>
1970s. You&#39;re in the Hundred Acre Woods of A A Milne&#39;s Winnie the <br/>
Pooh. :)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with everything! I&#39;m sure all will be well.<br/>
