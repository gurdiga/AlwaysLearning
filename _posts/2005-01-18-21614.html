<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Have you ever bought something for your husband or a friend or a sibling<br/>
 </span></blockquote>because you thought they would enjoy it, and then they did?  Have you ever<br/>
made food for someone because you thought they would like it, and then they<br/>
did?  <br/>
Probably everyone here has.  That&#39;s not unschooling.  That&#39;s thoughtfulness<br/>
and generosity.  The best unschoolers I&#39;ve ever known were thoughtful and<br/>
generous with their kids and lots of other people, too.&lt;&lt;<br/>
-------------------------<br/>
<br/>
This thought really sums it up.  I&#39;ve been frustrated lately because my<br/>
children have seemed particularly snippy and argumentative recently<br/>
(especially with each other).  So anyway, I finally got some quiet time<br/>
today to think it through and it occurred to me that they are getting bored<br/>
and unhappy.  So this morning I got up and started to think of things I<br/>
could offer or strew or instigate ;-) that they would enjoy or that would<br/>
seem valuable to them. When they get up I can ask them.<br/>
-I know this isn&#39;t ground breaking but I do tend to get wrapped up in my own<br/>
agenda and forget to be about the business of providing a fun, stimulating<br/>
environment for them.  My kids really like a lot of my time and attention.<br/>
Not just the little one but the 9 and 11 yo too.  The difference is, the big<br/>
ones will just see how busy I am and not ask for what they would like.  I<br/>
have to plan a bit to accommodate my own preferences (cleanish house, some<br/>
time alone,time to practice my music etc.) and still be attentive to the<br/>
need for all of my kids to have access to me and to the things they want<br/>
(various lessons, trips to the library, girl scouts, bowling, all kinds of<br/>
other things.  Many of you sound as though you balance all of this easily<br/>
but for me it&#39;s a never ending process.<br/>

==============<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s an inspirational e-mail bit that goes around about getting all  the <br/>
rocks to fit into the jar. Put the big ones in first.   (Summary  of long, <br/>
artsy story.  Apologies to the anonymous author for  that.&lt;g&gt;)<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s a priorities deal.  And different days can have different  priorities. <br/>
Life&#39;s not homogenous, but if we keep concentrating on the little  stuff, <br/>
there&#39;s no hole big enough for the big stuff.  <br/>
 <br/>
Big stuff first,and for me my big thing until my kids are grown is the  kids. <br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
Seasonally, I&#39;ll have some other &quot;big thing.&quot;  If  a friend has an emergency <br/>
need and I spend time with her,  my kids  understand. They know I&#39;ll get back <br/>
to them.<br/>
 <br/>
Lately I am a failure to finish Kirby&#39;s shower.  I&#39;m up to the  grout-sealing <br/>
and teensy detail stuff.  I should just go and do that.   Really.<br/>
 <br/>
So I try to do something special or particular with each kid each day if I  <br/>
can.  Yesterday I made sure Marty&#39;s favorite clothes were clean and  delivered, <br/>
and I made a fancy hog-dog buffet (lots of toppings, chili in a  crock-pot, <br/>
lots of chips, plates and napkins out...) for his role-playing game  guys.   I <br/>
watched the episodes of 24 we had taped, with Kirby, for  four hours.  Holly <br/>
and I hung out and talked about games and computers and  how she feels about <br/>
her brothers (positive conversation this time) and I felt  her hair.  She likes <br/>
people to mess with her hair, so I stroked it and  admired it, and I rubbed <br/>
her head where the really short hair is in back.   I think it kind of tickles <br/>
her, and it feels good to have a little head  massage.<br/>
 <br/>
It wasn&#39;t big-deal stuff, but I wanted them to go to sleep feeling that it  <br/>
was a good day.  And I had the good-day feeling too.<br/>
 <br/>
Oh!  And I had heated up the hot tub (my favorite toy for many years,  a <br/>
wood-fired hot-tub we got in December) for Keith, so he could get in when he  got <br/>
back from work.  I was happy, having shut the stove up when it reached  104 <br/>
degree.  Ooops, though... when he got home it was 110, and it had to  cool down <br/>
before he could use it.   Still, he felt good that it was  hot when he came <br/>
home, and it made me feel good that he got to soak his arm and  relax (after a <br/>
few hours. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Yes!  I&#39;m glad you mentioned it because I caught it happening it my house.  Son (10) was moping around bored while dad was playing a videogame.  Apparently, because dad has been so tired lately, son was (considerately) thinking that &quot;he shouldn&#39;t bother him.&quot;  I already knew that my son was very considerate when his dad was napping, but didn&#39;t think about him exerting himself to be considerate and (ow) self-effacing when his dad was awake.  I think I was a little slow on the uptake.<br/>
<br/>
My son is a lot more *selective* about what he wants to do than when he was little.  He doesn&#39;t dance with joy (anymore) at every offer I make. But just because he turns down many of my suggestions DOESN&#39;T mean that he doesn&#39;t want to spend time with me.  He just has a more specific set of possibilities in mind than he used to.  Because I started to worry about how little time we spent together (dad being greatly preferred when available), I got a little clearer in my priorities.  Now if he wants to be read to or play a game immediately, I (really try) to drop what I&#39;m doing and jump to it.<br/>

Oooh.<br/>
I think that curve continues into adulthood.<br/>
There are a few things Kirby wants to do with me or share with me, and lots  <br/>
he doesn&#39;t.  That&#39;s up from EVERYthing when he was little.   <br/>
 <br/>
Holly&#39;s just at 13 coming into not needing me or my approval or my  attention <br/>
or my notice all the time. She still sometimes does.  I&#39;d be  worried if she <br/>
were the first one, but with the third time it&#39;s not as scary or  sad.<br/>

**Big  stuff first,and for me my big thing until my kids are grown is the   <br/>
kids**<br/>
 <br/>
This was a good reminder for me today.  I&#39;ve been caught up with   a family <br/>
crisis and trying to get people to the airport, decide on when I need  to leave <br/>
to join family in New Mexico, getting Brenna ready for a trip and not  paying <br/>
any attention to Logan.<br/>
 <br/>
He is very self-sufficient and doesn&#39;t ask for much but I just needed to  <br/>
take some time and focus on him.  After I read this e-mail I went in and  asked <br/>
if there is anything he&#39;d like to do.<br/>
We came up with going to the Puppy Store and petting puppies and then  <br/>
playing some arcade games for awhile.  His cousin is going with us and  Brenna asked <br/>
to go too.<br/>
 <br/>
He knows that I&#39;m very preoccupied and was so happy that we can find the  <br/>
time to do this.<br/>
Stephen Covey was the first person I ever heard talk about fitting the  rocks <br/>
in the jar.  It made so much sense.  I sometimes just need that  little <br/>
reminder that my kids are the &quot;big stuff&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
Off to pet puppies...<br/>
