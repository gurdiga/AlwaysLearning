<br/>
I think people are in the wait a while and watch phase!   Or they&#39;re reading and writing elsewhere. <br/>
<br/>
Myself, I was in Florida with Keith and Holly, at the Florida Unschooling Conference, and then our flight home was cancelled so we stayed in a hotel in Dallas, and then it took me two days to recover (most of that time spent sleeping or reading).  <br/>
<br/>
Another thing happened last week.  Pam Sorooshian&#39;s daughter, Roya, lost her baby six days before her due date.  The cord was wrapped around, and baby Daisy expired in utero.  Those who are friends with Pam or Roya shouldn&#39;t write here; contact them otherwise, by facebook or e-mail.    Pam&#39;s not going to want to talk about it right now, I don&#39;t think, but people wanting to donate food or money can check a couple of places:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Take Them a Meal&quot;<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.takethemameal.com">http://www.takethemameal.com</a><br/>
Adam and Roya Dedeaux<br/>
password Daisy<br/>
<br/>
Or money to help them with expenses:<br/>

I usually disallow social causes on this list, but Pam has been a moderator (along with Joyce) since the day the list was formed, and has for a long time been living her unschooling life in public, for the benefit of others, and so this situation played out in public as well.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also very likely to be a partial cause of the very quiet few days here.<br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;m going to try to stir up some discussion so people will know their subscriptions to Always Learning are operational.<br/>
