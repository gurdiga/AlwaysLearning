<div id="ygrps-yiv-2072437001">Hi, I&#39;m new here.  I am a new homeschooling mom of 2 boys, ages 5 <br/>
and 3.  <br/>
My 5 yr old loves the Magic School Bus books.  Do you have any other <br/>
recommendations for books similar to Magic School Bus? <br/>
 <br/>
I like that my kids are enjoying reading books and also learning <br/>
about science at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Joy</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-335523243">My 4 year old also loves the Magic Treehouse books.  They are more history than science, but still very fun to read.  Have you started reading the Magic School Bus chapter books yet?  There are a lot of them and they are more in depth than the picture books.<br/>
