<div id="ygrps-yiv-2126765633">Hi Lyla:<br/>
<br/>
When my kids were younger we really enjoyed (actually we still enjoy) the<br/>
BBC animations of Shakespeare plays that are available on DVD.<br/>
<br/>
The girls also really liked reading *Shakespeare&#39;s Storybook: Folk Tales<br/>
That Inspired the Bard *by Patrick Ryan. It has a great version of Nicky<br/>
Nicky Nye in it that supposedly was inspiration for the Taming of the Shrew.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes, Cara<br/>
