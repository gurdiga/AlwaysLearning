<div id="ygrps-yiv-458688844">A few weeks ago, I posted a letter I wrote to a friend who briefly investigated unschooling before enrolling her son in an academic nursery school.<br/>
<br/>
Recently, she directed me to her blog, where she&#39;d posted some things about her life, and us, and unschooling...<br/>
<br/>
At the Friday chat, Sandra suggested that, rather than embroiling myself with debating a friend who doesn&#39;t truly want to understand, I could help people who really want to &quot;get it&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
So...her latest post really triggered a lot of thinking and clarity for me - which often means either I talk at Jim until his eyes glaze over, or I write. <br/>
<br/>
I wrote.  I won&#39;t post it here, but here is the link to my blogpost.  The top portion is what I sent to my friend, with the lovely post Claire wrote yesterday about finding calm (Claire, you said just what I wanted to so much better than I could, and shared at the perfect time!).<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is dealing with criticism or resistance, or trying to find their way through letting go of expectations, you may find something useful in the post...<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;d be interested in any swirls of thought that might arise....<br/>
