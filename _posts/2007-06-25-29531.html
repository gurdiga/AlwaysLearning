<div id="ygrps-yiv-263161663">I used to post a lot on Unschooling.com before it went kaput.  I <br/>
don&#39;t know if anyone remembers me or not.  It&#39;s not that important I <br/>
guess.  What is important is that I&#39;m finding myself miles from <br/>
where I want to be with my kids and really wanting to be back on the <br/>
path we used to be on.<br/>
<br/>
About two years ago now my husband and I split up and I had to go <br/>
back to work full time and move in with my parents and the kids went <br/>
into school and chaos reigned supreme.  I&#39;m still single (prefering <br/>
it this way actually) and I&#39;ve started going to college but the kids <br/>
are still in school and they would rather be home.  And I would <br/>
rather they were home.<br/>
<br/>
School hasn&#39;t been terrible for them.  They&#39;re strong kids.  But <br/>
it&#39;s the little things that have developed that are breaking my <br/>
heart like my always assertive daughter suddenly becoming shy and my <br/>
son being in a school without an art program (Aiden without art is <br/>
like a fish without water).  <br/>
<br/>
At this point I&#39;m not working and while I will be going to school <br/>
full time for the next 4 years it&#39;s only for a few hours a day.  I <br/>
don&#39;t see any reason why they need to be in school six hours.  But I <br/>
would need to find someone to watch them for 3 or 4 hours a day when <br/>
I am in school.  And my family isn&#39;t supportive in the least.  They <br/>
weren&#39;t supportive of unschooling when I was a SAHM and they are <br/>
doubly against it now.<br/>
<br/>
The kids are with their dad for the summer (first time for this and <br/>
it&#39;s for 2 whole months!!) and I feel all empty.  To fill that up a <br/>
little I started reading on this list again.  It&#39;s opened my eyes to <br/>
how far off track I have gotten.  Not just with unschooling but with <br/>
parenting in general.  There is way too much NO in our lives.  I <br/>
wanna bring YES back.  :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You can do it without their support! It won&#39;t be easy, but you can <br/>
do it! I wish you lived closer! We could work something out for <br/>
sure. But maybe there&#39;s somebody there. Are you still in the Tri-<br/>
Cities?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, ouch. Make yourself a countdown! Talk to them often. Two things <br/>
that got me through the months while Chloe was in England:<br/>
(1) Finding cool little things to mail to her -- stuff that wouldn&#39;t <br/>
take extra postage -- it was a fun hobby, and she loved it.<br/>
(2) Instant messaging. I&#39;m on the computer all day at work, so it <br/>
was always a huge thrill when I saw her log on.<br/>
<br/>
Are there any things like that to help you pass the time?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Cool! We&#39;ll keep you company while they&#39;re gone, and you get the fun <br/>
of rediscovering unschooling. How neat!<br/>
<br/>
Welcome back! You&#39;ve been missed!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, you guys HAVE to come to LIFE Is Good in Vancouver next May! <br/>
I&#39;ve always wanted to meet you!<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s so great to be back on a list where the stuff being written is <br/>
in line with how my heart feels.  I admit I tried to feel like the <br/>
other parents at the school but I just couldn&#39;t help feeling <br/>
argumentative about everything.  It&#39;s read so many familiar voices <br/>
too.<br/>
