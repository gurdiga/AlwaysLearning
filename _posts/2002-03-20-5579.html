were in school, he&#39;d be learning 6 hours a day, plus homework.  We usually <br/>
try to reassure him, etc., until he gets bored and stops. I think he freaks <br/>
when he talks to his mother, who is a retired teacher and always hated me <br/>
anyway.)<br/>
<br/>
Lately, though, Julian, 12, has had an academic burst of energy, and is doing <br/>
a cool set of courses through a weekend high school enrichment program at MIT <br/>
AND teaching himself high school chemistry with a CD-ROM he asked me to buy <br/>
him. Now Grandma and Dad can just reassure himself that Julian is Gifted, so <br/>
he&#39;s okay. <br/>
<br/>
We sort of shrug and decided it was all in how you market it.<br/>

plenty of friends in school. In fact, Perry (Julian&#39;s dad) should know better <br/>
because he went to a prep school he hated, followed by Hippy College <br/>
(Hampshire College, where we met), which he loved. His rants often hold <br/>
Julian&#39;s best friend, Nick, as an example of someone in school, who is <br/>
&quot;Learning All the Time and Getting a good Education.&quot; It sucks for Julian and <br/>
Nick, really. Ironic thing is Nick hates school, and his parents are hoping <br/>
that they will get him into a new Sudbury Valley School that is opening in <br/>
their area in the fall.<br/>
<br/>
Bizarre thing, and I wonder if anyone else has had this experience. I and <br/>
many of my friends have noticed a strange tendency in many cool men we know <br/>
(including Julian&#39;s dad, actually) to get scarily more conservative as they <br/>
hit middle age...but women often becoming more and more liberal. Is this just <br/>
our circle? Is there something in the water? Can we do something to stop this <br/>
frightening thing?<br/>

  JMHO, but I think the men (especially White men) learn as they get older that the conservative &quot;system&quot; WORKS for them...it benefits them.... why be liberal and fight for the rights of others when you already HAVE yours??  Don&#39;t jump down my throat....here is the usualy disclaimer...NOT ALL men are that way...but that&#39;s my theory. :-)<br/>

happening when we had a child. His thought processes became <br/>
more and more like his conservative parents. It was pretty scary. <br/>
He&#39;s only 34 though. Mind you, he&#39;s still runs in the music scene <br/>
and is fairly &#39;alternative&#39; in the rest of his life. His conservative <br/>
background just seems to come out in his childrearing practices <br/>

grew up shooting animals, eating only meat and potatoes, conservative,<br/>
narrow-minded... He was very cute though thank goodness:)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway now he is almost vegetarian, virtually a pacifist, and sometimes<br/>
more liberal in views than me!! He says I rubbed off on him.<br/>

&gt; Just curious.  What makes it a &quot;hippie college&quot;?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I call it that...  It was &quot;invented&quot; in the late 60&#39;s by educators from <br/>
UMass/Amherst, Amherst College, Mt. Holyoke, and Smith. Hamphire has no <br/>
required courses, credits, or grades. The approach to learning is called <br/>
Modes of Inquiry -- depending on what you&#39;re learning, you ask questions in <br/>
different ways. How you might study Natural Science would be different from <br/>
how you might study Literature, for example. <br/>
<br/>
The approach to learning in a class is often different too...rather than <br/>
beginning with, say, Biology 101 or Intro to Sociology, Hampshire offers <br/>
courses  like:The Ecological Footprint: A Tool For A Sustainable Future, <br/>
Human Gene Therapy: Proceed with Caution, Life Stories from Latin America, <br/>
Women and Gender in Catholic Europe (Ca. 300-1700). Rather than going from <br/>
the general to specific interest, it&#39;s the opposite, where you begin to learn <br/>
about something you&#39;re interested in, then learn the general stuff to support <br/>
your understanding.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s more, but I won&#39;t ramble :)<br/>

to do nothing but study military history and world security issues.&quot;  <br/>
His courses are Imagining Latin America and the Middle East; Conflict <br/>
Resolution and Historical Analysis; Black Nationalism, Emigration, <br/>
and Conflicting Views of Citizenship in African-American History; and <br/>
The State in Africa:  Between Democratic Reform, Paralysis, and <br/>
Collapse.<br/>
<br/>
He defines the term military broadly: military history is the history <br/>
of armed conflict.  In Hampshire-ese, his field of study translates <br/>
into &quot;Peace and Conflict Studies in Modern History with an Emphasis <br/>
on Western Expansion.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I wrote in a previous post about his experience chasing grades at the <br/>
junior college and why he would love a place where every assignment <br/>
receives the instructor&#39;s personal evaluation rather than a &#39;grade.&#39;<br/>
