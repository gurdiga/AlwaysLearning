<div id="ygrps-yiv-249558028">Dear Sandra and all the always learning kids-at-heart,<br/>
 <br/>
I just needed to share with someone how totally excited I am to have <br/>
found another pot of Gold in my life. <br/>
 <br/>
I am getting ahead of myself and I have not properly introduced me. My <br/>
name is Darlene Navarre, 33 (until Oct 21) I am totally (most of the <br/>
time) happily married to Blake, 45 and we have 5 children (first 3 from <br/>
previous marriage): Danyell, 17 Marc, 14 Breeana 10, Mitchel 5 and <br/>
Carter 3. For the time we live in Las Vegas, NV. <br/>
 <br/>
I started home school (the yucky blucky way) or what I like to call the <br/>
not-learning way 9 years ago. I was a control freak and my children <br/>
were rebelling.<br/>
 <br/>
I knew instinctively that this way of teaching did NOT feel right or <br/>
logical and I am a very logical simplistic thinker. Yet what to do? Then <br/>
3 years ago I got the &quot;Unschooling Handbook&quot; read 2 chapters and I was <br/>
hooked. My husband was not. We fought and fought for now 3 years over <br/>
&quot;schooling&quot;. My son that is 14 opted to go to high school and my 10 year <br/>
daughter wanted to go to elementary. I believe it was do to the fact <br/>
that they were confused and felt in the middle of a battle. (I don&#39;t <br/>
blame them). <br/>
 <br/>
In March Mitchel, turned 5 and my husband convinced me to put him in a <br/>
charter home program through the district. I hated it right away and <br/>
Mitchel felt forced to do something he already knew. Mitchel is very very <br/>
bright person, he loves to draw and play with numbers in his head , <br/>
tell made-up stories, make books with drawings and story line etc.... I <br/>
knew I had to be aggressive or else he could lose his creativity, just as <br/>
my 3 older ones seem to have. I read the whole unschooling handbook, <br/>
pleaded with my husband and unenrolled M from charter program.The more I read about unschooling, the more I learn, the more I talk about life <br/>
learning, the more my husband does well with it. (finally) <br/>
 <br/>
He should already know what a free thinker I am and if only I (who <br/>
missed so much school and eventually dropped out pregnant at 16) would have <br/>
been given this freedom to learn I could have accomplished so much <br/>
more. (no regrets just lessons) <br/>
 <br/>
You know its amazing that people make a BIG issue out of just everyday <br/>
stuff. I had my last baby at home just husband, kids and I, why go to a <br/>
hospital? I still (and will remain until their ready  to stop) breast <br/>
feed my 5 and 3 year old and would not dream of it any other, why does <br/>
anyone want to get up and make a bottle or all the other complicated <br/>
stuff involved with bottle? Sleeping arrangements are sleep with mom and <br/>
dad until your ready (I would be happy if they slept with me until they <br/>
left the house), why spend the time or money on extra rooms and cribs? <br/>
I feed 2 little ones (by their up bring and choice) only raw fruits and <br/>
veggies, why heat up a house or use the electricity when you don&#39;t need <br/>
to? <br/>
 <br/>
My new discovery or pot of logical gold: Do we force a child to walk <br/>
and talk or run? Is that not learning? Why I did not see the common and <br/>
logical sense of children learning on their own long ago? I could just <br/>
kick myself but all I can do now is give them ALL the knowledge I have <br/>
acquired and ask the older 3 to forgive me and hope that they learn from <br/>
mom&#39;s mistakes. <br/>
 <br/>
I Love myself more for learning the lessons once again. The ones that I <br/>
knew so long ago when I begged my mom to let me stay at home and just <br/>
let me choose how, why and the wheres of learning. <br/>
 <br/>
Thank you all of your time and care,<br/>
Peace and Love,<br/>
Darlene<br/>
<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We couldn&#39;t even if we tried.<br/>
We can&#39;t even TEACH them to walk and talk and run.<br/>
<br/>
They learn it themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Ta Daaaaa!!!<br/>

<br/>
What a schoolish phrase you&#39;ve chosen. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Not lessons.   <br/>
<br/>
VERY exciting post, though and thank you for sharing it!<br/>
