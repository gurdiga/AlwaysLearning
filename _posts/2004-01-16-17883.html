I would look for a new pediatrician.  It is not really her job to<br/>
monitor your child&#39;s education.  You are purchasing health care for<br/>
your child from her.  Our pediatrician is quite supportive of our<br/>
unschooling (he actually took the time to watch Aidan&#39;s youtube videos<br/>
at his last appointment) so I know there are some good ones out there.<br/>
   Ideally, they should be supportive of your choices as a parent or,<br/>
at the very least, not &quot;irksome&quot;.<br/>
Enjoy those aha moments!! <br/>

 </span></blockquote>  After watching my god children get yanked away by cps over ridiculous stuff i must suggest exercising caution as to what information you give out. Its not your pediatrician&#39;s child to monitor your childs education but they are required by law to report any suspected neglect or abuse ........this has a very broad definition and it can and in some cases has been thrown way out of proportion by cps. <br/>
   <br/>
  One answer I generaly give for both homseschooling and unschooling is oh I have a list of things they should cover ( anyone with a net connection can get to several lists) and I check them off as we get to them. <br/>

<br/>
They&#39;re afraid you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing and that will  <br/>
increase their fears. Face them without confidence and they go for  <br/>
the jugular ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I know you were caught off guard. I probably would have blurted out  <br/>
the same, but now you know and can come up with some better answers. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Find a list of books and websites and keep a list. Whip it out when  <br/>
they start questioning you and say &quot;Here you can read more about it  <br/>
here. It&#39;s difficult to explain succinctly to those unfamiliar with  <br/>
natural learning. Then if you have questions, I&#39;d be happy to answer.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You can turn questions around. Why do you believe testing is  <br/>
necessary? Did you test your kids on their acquisition of English?<br/>
<br/>
Scour the archives here and find other things people have said.<br/>
<br/>
You can find a new pediatrician who understands natural learning.<br/>
<br/>
You are not powerless. One of the (many!) bad parts of school and  <br/>
conventional parenting is that it teaches us to sit down shut up and  <br/>
listen to experts because they know more than we do.<br/>

exists).  There are &quot;scope and sequence&quot; lists on the internet and in <br/>
books, or you can type up a list from Rebecca Rupp&#39;s book &quot;Home <br/>
Learning Year by Year.&quot;  And then add other stuff that&#39;s not on the <br/>
list, if you want to, like quilting or baking or practical computer <br/>
skills or multimedia research (&quot;googling&quot;).  If there&#39;s something you <br/>
need to prove to somebody authoritative, you can even check off the <br/>
things the kids already know, point to the checkmarks on the list, <br/>
and say &quot;we have covered this and this and this,&quot; letting them <br/>
believe you &quot;taught&quot; those things.  The idea is not to actually <br/>
follow the list, just to have it on hand in case you need it, even if <br/>
that just means bolstering your confidence when speaking to people in <br/>
positions of authority.</div>

be clearer.  We are consumers and as consumers we have choices.  If we<br/>
are subject to scrutiny at a doctor&#39;s office, we can make choices to<br/>
ensure that we are viewed in the best light.  I interviewed<br/>
pediatricians, dentists, and midwives to make sure their beliefs are<br/>
aligned with mine as far as care, prevention, and intervention.  I<br/>
believe by doing this, I have minimized any unwelcome intrusion into<br/>
my family&#39;s lives by a stranger who may only see us for a few minutes<br/>
every great once in a while.  As an even better result, we have, over<br/>
the years, built a great relationship of trust with our health care<br/>
providers that gives me comfort in knowing exactly where I could/would<br/>
turn if our parenting was ever questioned.  I would simply hope that<br/>
others could find that same sense of security.<br/>

I think that your energy and impulse to do more could be an awesome resource for you to <br/>
use in strewing.  Look at what they are really digging right now and find connections to <br/>
other things that they may find interesting.  Or just go more deeply into what they are <br/>
already doing.  Unschooling isn&#39;t a stand back and don&#39;t do anything venture--it&#39;s just <br/>
that the &quot;what you do&quot; part isn&#39;t going to look like what you&#39;d do in school.  It actually <br/>
does take a lot of energy and care--so use it and channel it in ways that your kids will <br/>
really enjoy.<br/>

Welcome to the list, but our encouragement is going to be about  <br/>
unschooling.  Feel free to read, though!  The archives are there and  <br/>
searchable.<br/>
<br/>
Are you unschooling?  If so, if you want to tell us stories about how  <br/>
the unschooling environment is working at your house, that would be  <br/>
cool, but too much advice about dealing with school might be  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1901007915">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; i told her that i didn&#39;t know. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s worth knowing answers to these types of questions, and even <br/>
practicing them so that they pop out rote-fast. It gives the impression of <br/>
confidence.<br/>
<br/>
EG &quot;He&#39;s 8 so if he were in school he would probably be in 2nd grade&quot;. A <br/>
reminder that it is such a low grade (&quot;only&quot; 2nd grade) in the scheme of <br/>
things might be helpful too.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; my pediatrician was questioning whether or not my 8yo son was on grade<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; level. she asked how i checked that stuff  i.e grades, tests, school<br/>
&gt; curriculum to follow etc.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sometimes when people question me, which is rare and usually strangers, I <br/>
respond with information about the state regulations. For example I can say, <br/>
&quot;There are no tests mandated for us in the state of California.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There are also a few useful phrases like &quot;integrated vocational learning <br/>
plan&quot; and &quot;interest led gestalt learning&quot; and &quot;follow our individualized <br/>
path while retaining an awareness of state standards&quot;. (Once a year I read <br/>
the standards info, then put it away - don&#39;t do this if it will make you <br/>
feel scared or doubtful).<br/>
<br/>
When you respond with some blurb about the regs in your state, it does two <br/>
things - demonstrates that you are fully informed, and hints that there is <br/>
some &quot;authority&quot; to which you are &quot;accountable&quot; (so the questioner can rest <br/>
easy and not take on that self-appointed role).<br/>

  We have home schooled for 12 years and I have been reading about unschooling for 10 of those years - attempting it then getting sucked back in to schoolishness, back and forth.  It&#39;s ridiculous.  My whole desire is to be able to trust my kids&#39; natural curiosity to learn and I want to deal with my fears as to why I keep going back to schoolish things (we do a math paper and spelling list once a day) - why can&#39;t I just let it go?  I know a lot of it is people-pleasing - maybe I want to be &quot;liked&quot; or feel like I belong to &quot;both&quot; groups....hmmm, I&#39;ll have to ponder that some more.  After reading the posts for the last couple of days, I&#39;m sure that my issues will get dealt with faster than I thought :)<br/>
   <br/>
  We do foster care and have 3 foster kiddos right now as well as 4 kids we birthed and 1 we adopted.  The foster kids have to go to public school and that is interesting considering the complete contrast of everyone else.  Have any of you ever had your kids go to public school?  If so, what do you do about homework?  My feeling is I don&#39;t really give a rip about their homework or grades for that matter so sometimes I have them do it, and sometimes I don&#39;t.  I tell the teachers that I am more concerned about their emotional well-being than their academics right now, which I can get away with because of their situations.  But after a few months it doesn&#39;t hold much water!  One of the kiddos loves to do her homework, but the others have to be reminded.  Would an unschooling way of approaching this be that they are accountable to the whole ball of wax (going to class, taking tests, doing homework, etc.), or would it be that they do only as much of that as they want?  We don&#39;t<br/>
 really have an option of whether they go or not, although if they miss a day or I keep them home because I want to I don&#39;t make a big deal out of it one way or the other.  Any thoughts?<br/>
   <br/>
  Again, I&#39;ve enjoyed reading the posts and appreciate the candid honesty that is represented.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-154222364">Hi Shannon and nice to &quot;meet&quot; you. That&#39;s quite a crew you have there! Do<br/>
you mind if I ask how long you&#39;ve had your foster children and if they would<br/>
like to unschool if they could? I had foster kids who looked with longing at<br/>
the unschooled ones while participating in as many unschooling activities as<br/>
their schooled lives allowed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-990305137">Thanks for all your responses.When I go to my kids dr. she always <br/>
asks my oldest, the 8yo, what grade he is in. He then proceedes to <br/>
tell her for the umpteeenth time that he is homeschooled. Normally I <br/>
am really laid back and don&#39;t really care, it is really none of her <br/>
buisness.I have NEVER given her a reason to question any of my <br/>
parenting abilities.However when i went this last time and she <br/>
started questioning me i was caught off guard.And she also asked him <br/>
who his best friend was.This really pissed me off, after the fact, <br/>
because I think she was trying to be sneaky with the &quot;socialization&quot; <br/>
issue. But I couldn&#39;t have asked for a better response than what he <br/>
gave her...&quot;My brother is my best friend&quot;. I had such an in your face <br/>
feeling...it was great.But then we had to go back on monday, 4 days <br/>
later, and she proceeded to say that she was really concerned which <br/>
threw me for another loop and we got into a discussion about <br/>
schooling etc.Now I know she is a mandated reporter, so am I, I work <br/>
with abused kids in a residential facility, but I think I was more <br/>
appalled to think that someone would question me.Not saying that i am <br/>
perfect, far from it but really. plus she dosen&#39;t know me....wait <br/>
this sounds like i am justifying what she did. I am not. As a dr. she <br/>
is pretty good.But she did put a bug in my bonnet which then in turn <br/>

#4 and a husband 2 weeks post-op with shoulder surgery #4 I think she <br/>
just hit a nerve.I did get a copy of the K-8 curriculum guide for the <br/>

realized that my 8 yo was not up to thier &quot;standards&quot; in some areas, <br/>
like reading,but was well advanced in other areas like science and <br/>
geography...stuff he really enjoys. Of course I can think of all this <br/>
stuff now. I almost want to write her a letter but I think that would <br/>
be a bad idea and just start something that I am eventually not going <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-423339168">I don&#39;t post to this group often but read the many wonderful messages here daily. <br/>
I am fairly new to unschooling and the concepts. I am reading lots and my oldest two(15 & 12) and I have been deschooling for nearly a year and a half. We sort of stumbled into unschoolng and have fallen in love with it. My children have never been in school however we were enrolled in charter schools which require the same type of work only done at home. They are finding some interests that are expanding their knowledge base. I do have questions about how to incorporate basic things like advanced math to their lives without it being a tedious learning chore, however that is not the reason for this post. <br/>
<br/>
I have two smaller children (6 & 5) who recently came to me and asked me to teach them to read. I will honestly say I don&#39;t know how to do this in an unschooly way. I know that I can not TEACH them to read. I do do things with them that try to promote them learning. someone in the house reads to them daily, we all take turns with this and typically my husband does bedtime stories. Its their special time. I have been able to show my children that they already know many words. I just am not sure what to do to help them feel like they are learning at a pace that satisfies them. I did recently get the new scrabble card game and thought this would be fun as you change a word. It starts out with one word then you use the cards in your hand to change the word. I thought it sounded like loads of fun and could be modified to do 3 letter words that they already know. I just don&#39;t know what else to do. <br/>
<br/>
So My question for this group would be what are some ways you have helped your little ones learn to read? My 6 year old wants it NOW, she doesn&#39;t want a slow progression. Any Ideas on things to do with her to help her feel like she is progressing at the speed she is comfortable with? I am also open if anyone has suggestions on math concepts <br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2048962548">When Megan started reading at 7, it seemed like there was a switch turned on. One day she liked for me to read things to her and the next day she could read it for herself. <br/>
<br/>
She had been able to read the shorter words (i remember reading a Dr. Suess book when she was almost 5). But it was different when she started to read at 7. <br/>
<br/>
I am seeing the same thing with math and spelling. She&#39;s playing with numbers & words now in a way that is fascinating. <br/>

Try to gently get yourself and them both away from only being  <br/>
satisfied with documentable learning.   If each activity is fun, and  <br/>
they&#39;re learning (however they&#39;re learning), don&#39;t look to the future,  <br/>

Video games and online games, there is a ton of text in these!<br/>
Games2girls.com was a favorite, and webkinz and pbskids.com and nickjr.com<br/>
and many many others.   Rainbowmagic.com and the other HIT sites have more<br/>
text than others I think.<br/>
Starfall.com, more when she was in the 3-4 year range<br/>
Flashcards with common words on them - we got these at a bookstore and they<br/>
came with a thing where you put the &quot;words I know&quot; and &quot;words I don&#39;t know<br/>
yet&quot;  This was really fun for her after she felt like she was reading, to<br/>
build her vocabulary quickly so she could read more books.  She didn&#39;t like<br/>
reading books because she would encounter many words she didn&#39;t yet know.<br/>
<br/>
My two year old is really into letters nowadays and enjoys Super Why on PBS<br/>
and starfall.com as well.<br/>

 <br/>
All around us kids are feeling pressured to read and read now, read sooner, better.  There are dozens of programs to help force this idea on children.  Special aids are hired by schools to get kids reading sooner.  Volunteers are put to task to read with kids.  All this spinning of wheels for something that will happen if given the time and space to do so.<br/>
 <br/>
If there is any way to buffer that for your kids, do it.  I know it&#39;s hard, my oldest struggled with seeing her friends reading and not being able to do so.  There were some things that helped.  We listened to a LOT of books on tape and cd, so book for book, she&#39;d &quot;read&quot; more than all of her school aged peers.  She could easily talk about these stories with friends that had read them too.  It also helped her build up her vocabulary base so that when she was finally reading, those words weren&#39;t new to her.<br/>
 <br/>
There were many things that helped her build her word collection.  She played ToonTown a lot.  That was significant in helping her learn to read.  There is a chat function in TT that allows players to talk to each other, she had to use it to interact with other players, so she figured out what those chat things said.  Video games in general played a huge part in word gathering and word recognition.  Through video games, and Pokemon, she became interested in anime and manga.  The very first book that she read all the way through, was manga.  She did that when she was 11ish.<br/>
 <br/>
When she looks back on her time of not being able to read, she says that she did feel like she should be reading, but that she put it aside with other things she wasn&#39;t able to do yet.  She feels wholeheartedly that she owns her reading experience, it&#39;s something she did, in her own brain.  She wishes all kids could experience that ownership of learning something complex and important.<br/>
 <br/>
Math, like reading is all around us.  Chamille, my oldest again, never was a big numbers person, but she could always calculate money.  One day about a year or so ago, she&#39;s 15 now, we were at the store and I was trying to decide which was the better buy on some cheese, should I buy the larger amount or the smaller amount?  She picked up the smaller one and said, this is the better buy, you should get 2 of these instead of the big pack.  She&#39;d figured it out in her head somehow and quickly, quicker than me.  That&#39;s real math.  It happens, it really does.  Some kids, like my younger daughter, 8, are just naturally number and pattern oriented.  She&#39;s been doing numbers and patterns in her head for years.  She figured out how to count by 3&#39;s when she was about 4ish.  <br/>
 <br/>
Kids will pick things up through living.  If you think you aren&#39;t doing enough, do more, play more games, have more opportunities to explore and experience.  Don&#39;t think of it as teaching or finding teachable moments, think of it as experience gathering that adds more and more things to learn and draw from. <br/>
