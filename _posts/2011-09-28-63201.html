<div id="ygrps-yiv-671762952">Recently my 5 year old has been having a difficult time every time we go somewhere.  These are all places she wants to go, but she complains about having to walk or having to take the bus.  Yesterday, we went to dance class and we needed to take the bus there and walk home.  She complained about taking the bus there (&quot;I don&#39;t want to ride the bus! I want to walk!  We never get to go on walks!  Fine, if I can&#39;t walk there, I&#39;m not going!&quot;)  Once we got on the bus, she was fine until it was time to go home.  (&quot;I don&#39;t want to walk!  I&#39;m too tired, it&#39;s too hot, my legs hurt.  Why can&#39;t we take the bus?!  Fine, if I can&#39;t take the bus, I&#39;m not going home!&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
As we walked home, I told her that taking the bus and walking home is part of doing dance and gymnastics right now.  I tried to brainstorm ideas to make walking easier for her, but the only thing I could come up with is that she could ride her bike once she learns how.  I already bring food, water, comfortable shoes, we sing songs (ants go marching and that kind of thing).  <br/>
<br/>
Today, we took the bus to the library story time and back home.  While walking to the bus stop and waiting for the bus, she was complaining about taking the bus (&quot;I want to walk!  We NEVER get to walk anywhere!  I&#39;m not getting on the bus!&quot;)  So I told her (calmly, matter of factly) that I was tired of listening to her complain every time we went somewhere, and that tomorrow she can stay home with her dad while I take her sister to gymnastics, because I don&#39;t want to listen to it on the way home.  Then I realized that that was really like punishment, so I said that she could go to gymnastics if we could come up with some ideas to make walking easier for her.  She was not interested in brainstorming, she just started saying over and over &quot;I want to go!  I want to go!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I told her that she could choose to sit there and cry about not going or she could choose to brainstorm ways to make walking easier so that she could go and get home without complaining, but it was her choice and crying about it wasn&#39;t going to change my mind.   <br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t talk about it again until we got home and she brought up my idea to ride her bike.  That will be fine at some point, but right now, it needs to be fixed and she doesn&#39;t know how to ride it.  So, we are going to work on that, but in the meantime, what do I do about gymnastics tomorrow?  We have to take the bus there and walk home.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like the way I handled it, but I don&#39;t know what else to do.  Any ideas for making the walk easier and how I can handle future situations better?<br/>

What about walking TO gymnastics and taking the bus home, rather than the other way around.  That makes sense given that the kids would me less tired on the way to somewhere than on the way home.  Can you take a stroller or wagon with you for tired kids?  Maybe dad can take the kid with the class, to class while you stay home and go on a pleasant, non rushed walk.<br/>

You made it about you.  Sometimes that&#39;s fine, but you could have made a list of times you&#39;ve walked, just to clarify that &quot;never&quot; wasn&#39;t true.  <br/>
<br/>
Just because someone wants to eat doesn&#39;t means she ALWAYS wants to eat.  Just because I turn down food when I&#39;m full doesn&#39;t mean I never want food again.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes someone might want to walk, but that doesn&#39;t mean she never wants to sit down, or never wants to take the bus.  <br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you&#39;re both dealing in extremes.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1530248550">&lt;&lt; I told her that she could choose to sit there and cry about not going or she could choose to brainstorm ways to make walking easier so that she<br/>
could go and get home without complaining, but it was her choice and crying about it wasn&#39;t going to change my mind.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
By  continually emphasizing that it&#39;s *her choice* it can come across like you&#39;re laying the blame for your frustration at her feet. She&#39;s knows<br/>
you&#39;re frustrated. It&#39;s also likely she would prefer not to be crying, not to be upset, but her behaviour is all she can come up with in the moment -<br/>
she&#39;s gotten to point where she doesn&#39;t see any other choices. Telling her she&#39;s choosing to be upset isn&#39;t giving her any useful information to move<br/>
forward through the situation. It can help to look at things from her perspective. From there you may be able to suss out why she&#39;s thinking things<br/>
like &quot;We never get to walk anywhere&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Cold starts to conversations with younger kids are challenging. They don&#39;t have much experience to draw on or to make connections to that help start<br/>
off brainstorming for solutions on their own. I&#39;ve had better success when I start the ball rolling (in a calm and relaxed moment later, not during<br/>
the frustration), something like &quot;I was thinking we could play XX on the bus ride home tomorrow to help it go faster.&quot; Or &quot;Shall we bring YY with us<br/>
when we walk to gymnastics tomorrow?&quot; Or vice versa.<br/>
<br/>
Starting with your own suggestion shows her that you&#39;re thinking about it, about her. That you&#39;re making an effort to make things more pleasant for<br/>
her knowing that she wants to go. It also gives her a starting place to think about the situation herself. She may say &quot;Oh, that&#39;ll be fun!&quot; and it<br/>
will be something to look forward to about the bus or walk. Or she may say &quot;No, I want to bring ZZ.&quot; Cool! Another idea. And don&#39;t hold her<br/>
&quot;agreement&quot; over her head if it doesn&#39;t work out the next time. Try something else. And something else. In the bigger picture, with every step in the<br/>
process you guys are figuring out ways to work things out together.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-181446409">We have lots of littles and one thing we decided early on was to always have<br/>
a big enough stroller so that they have option to walk or ride. When we<br/>
hike, we only have a double jogging stroller so my husband and I each wear<br/>
front or backpacks to compensate for the lack of seats.<br/>
5 is still pretty little, so to expect walking on an adult&#39;s terms is kinda<br/>
unrealistic, I think. My kiddos havn&#39;t been ready to walk independently<br/>
until at least 6 or 7 full time.<br/>
At first, many of them want to walk when we go out so we usually start by<br/>
declaring that we&#39;re some kind of team (dinosaur or super hero or<br/>
whatever).  They&#39;re usually enthusiastic at that point and so we keep it<br/>
going with stomping or flying or something along those lines. Yes, we get<br/>
strange looks often, but the kids are happy and we&#39;re moving along nicely.<br/>
We also play I spy or guessing games as we walk.  This can get really fun if<br/>
we&#39;re at the zoo or museum. It amazes me to see the things they pick out of<br/>
the scenery.<br/>
I think the biggest thing is to keep it fun and recognize when they&#39;re done.<br/>
A good stroller and a positive attitude can go a long way.<br/>

<br/>
Gymnastics is later in the evening and the bus does not run at all that late.<br/>
<br/>
Whether we take the bus or walk, she complains and wants to do the other one, so I&#39;ve made the decisions based on time of day (trying not to walk in the worst heat), how long the bus ride will be, trying to take the bus before class so they aren&#39;t tired from the walk during class, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the stroller suggestion.  We don&#39;t own one and the budget is very tight right now.  My husband is doing an little construction job right now that will end in a few weeks, and there is nothing else lined up.   <br/>
<br/>
Even if I could get one for free, I don&#39;t know if I would be willing to do that.  The walk is less than a mile, and she has been capable of doing that since she was 3.  She asks to go on hikes and walks where she walks that far.  It would mean me pushing 85 pounds of children (including my 3 year old who does all or most of the walk without complaint) and carrying the baby on my back, plus struggling with it on the bus one way.  I don&#39;t mind carrying my kids past the socially acceptable norm, or in this case pushing them (last summer I carried her at 4 years old on my back with her sister who was 2 on the front while I was pregnant fairly often.  Now I carry the baby and my 3 year old), but think I&#39;m done with my 5 year old.   <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes my husband comes with us and then we take the wagon and walk both ways, but he can&#39;t always come.    <br/>

Good advice from Pam L.   Also, remember she&#39;s older every time.  You&#39;re not working longterm to figure out how to keep a five year old happy.  Soon she won&#39;t be five anymore.  You&#39;re helping her grow up into a thoughtful woman.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;As we get older and our kids grow up, we eventually come to realize that all the big things in our lives are really the direct result of how we&#39;ve handled all the little things.&quot; �Pam Sorooshian, June 4, 2007<br/>

<br/>
So your daughter is kind of like you?  Because people have cheerfully made suggestions, and you&#39;ve said no, that&#39;s not what you want.  Even if it was free, you wouldn&#39;t want it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Now I carry the baby and my 3 year old), but think I&#39;m done with my 5 year old. -=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You wrote this:   I&#39;m done with my 5 year old.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a very strong thing to write.  Not willing to push her, might take the bicycle she doesn&#39;t know how to ride yet (that sounded very, very dangerous when you wrote it before, and you know you would end up lifting it in and out of a bus, and then probably walking it along the road, but that was on your list of possibilities)....<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea what you expected us to recommend.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re done with your five year old, you could put her up for adoption.  It sounds like she&#39;s never happy and you&#39;re not willing to compromise.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, that&#39;s very extreme, on purpose.  Will you choose to keep her?  Can you find the joy in the situation?  Maybe not going to the dance class would be better, if it&#39;s causing so much grief.<br/>
<br/>
Just because a child can read, sometimes parents stop reading to them.   Because a child can read Hop on Pop, the parent won&#39;t read Treasure Island to him.  Sometimes a three year old can walk a long way, for a three year old, but for her to learn that her mother will never carry her again seems harsh.  Not even in a stroller?<br/>
<br/>
It might help to think of the principle of the thing and of your priorities.  The purpose of walking home is to get home.  MAYBE it would be more fun to do something and wait for the later bus than to endure the unhappiness.  Maybe if being home is important, staying home would solve the problem.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2047576843">========= By  continually emphasizing that it&#39;s *her choice* it can come across like you&#39;re laying the blame for your frustration at her feet. She&#39;s knows<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; you&#39;re frustrated. It&#39;s also likely she would prefer not to be crying, not to be upset, but her behaviour is all she can come up with in the moment -<br/>
&gt; she&#39;s gotten to point where she doesn&#39;t see any other choices. Telling her she&#39;s choosing to be upset isn&#39;t giving her any useful information to move<br/>
&gt; forward through the situation. ============<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is something I have been trying to work out in my own mind lately.   Often I try to help her brainstorm ideas and help in other ways and she just gets stuck.  She won&#39;t move past whatever she is upset about.  I validate her feelings, give her time and space, but ultimately it&#39;s like she is blaming me for her upset when I have done everything in my power to help.  I don&#39;t want her growing up with a victim mentality (&quot;I can&#39;t do anything.  Everyone is out to make my life miserable.&quot;), so I get to a point when I say things like that.  &quot;You can cry about it or you can do xyz (and I always give ideas) to change it.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Now I totally get that in this situation I was the one who was setting up the choices (either brainstorm ideas so you are ok on the walk home or I won&#39;t let you go), so it would be my fault that she couldn&#39;t go if I didn&#39;t let her go.  That&#39;s why I didn&#39;t feel right about saying that this time.  But I don&#39;t know what to say in those situations!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1800681449">We used a walking bike to get to places when the children were younger and my 4 year old still uses hers to get around.

We also play lots of games when we are walking, taking the bus or going by train - trying to catch and squish each other&#39;s shadows, going on an alphabet walk, learning the lyrics of a favourite song together, playing I Spy games (where we make drawings of things we might see while we are traveling and then checking them off), word association games, rhyming games, &quot;if I could have anything in the world&quot; type games, creating a story together, etc.<br/>
<br/>
For my two children, 4 and 6, the journey has to be an event on its own. Something special and exciting, otherwise it&#39;s much more stressful for all of us.<br/>

&gt; Recently my 5 year old has been having a difficult time every time we go<br/>
somewhere. These are all places she wants to go, but she complains about<br/>
having to walk or having to take the bus. Yesterday, we went to dance class<br/>
and we needed to take the bus there and walk home. She complained about<br/>
taking the bus there (&quot;I don&#39;t want to ride the bus! I want to walk! We<br/>
never get to go on walks! Fine, if I can&#39;t walk there, I&#39;m not going!&quot;) Once<br/>
we got on the bus, she was fine until it was time to go home. (&quot;I don&#39;t want<br/>
to walk! I&#39;m too tired, it&#39;s too hot, my legs hurt. Why can&#39;t we take the<br/>
bus?! Fine, if I can&#39;t take the bus, I&#39;m not going home!&quot;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As we walked home, I told her that taking the bus and walking home is part<br/>
of doing dance and gymnastics right now. I tried to brainstorm ideas to make<br/>
walking easier for her, but the only thing I could come up with is that she<br/>
could ride her bike once she learns how. I already bring food, water,<br/>
comfortable shoes, we sing songs (ants go marching and that kind of thing).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Today, we took the bus to the library story time and back home. While<br/>
walking to the bus stop and waiting for the bus, she was complaining about<br/>
taking the bus (&quot;I want to walk! We NEVER get to walk anywhere! I&#39;m not<br/>
getting on the bus!&quot;) So I told her (calmly, matter of factly) that I was<br/>
tired of listening to her complain every time we went somewhere, and that<br/>
tomorrow she can stay home with her dad while I take her sister to<br/>
gymnastics, because I don&#39;t want to listen to it on the way home. Then I<br/>
realized that that was really like punishment, so I said that she could go<br/>
to gymnastics if we could come up with some ideas to make walking easier for<br/>
her. She was not interested in brainstorming, she just started saying over<br/>
and over &quot;I want to go! I want to go!&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I told her that she could choose to sit there and cry about not going or<br/>
she could choose to brainstorm ways to make walking easier so that she could<br/>
go and get home without complaining, but it was her choice and crying about<br/>
it wasn&#39;t going to change my mind.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We didn&#39;t talk about it again until we got home and she brought up my idea<br/>
to ride her bike. That will be fine at some point, but right now, it needs<br/>
to be fixed and she doesn&#39;t know how to ride it. So, we are going to work on<br/>
that, but in the meantime, what do I do about gymnastics tomorrow? We have<br/>
to take the bus there and walk home.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t like the way I handled it, but I don&#39;t know what else to do. Any<br/>
ideas for making the walk easier and how I can handle future situations<br/>
better?<br/>

After gymnastics, the bus does not run that late.  After dance, the timing would mean getting home 2 hours after class gets out (and still walking home from the bus stop) rather than walking and getting home in 20 minutes.</div>

The walk is less than a mile, and she has been capable of doing that since she was 3.  She asks to go on hikes and walks where she walks that far.  It would mean me pushing 85 pounds of children (including my 3 year old who does all or most of the walk without complaint) and carrying the baby on my back, plus struggling with it on the bus one way.

<br/>
So you are unwilling to do anything that may help your daughter?? Why did you ask her then? Did you want people to say it was OK to make her walk without complaining ?<br/>
Maybe she rather not go to gymnastics and dance.  <br/>
Maye walk back and forth with a stroller does not mean she and the 3 year old will want to ride the whole time in it.<br/>
I used to take my stroller everywhere ( a jogging one with fat wheels that can go on rough terrain). It was a life saver sometimes and it was great to take stuff in it like water, extra clothes and snacks. Sometimes I took it just to carry stuff!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My daughter is 7 this year, and I still carry her when she gets tired. <br/>
(Admittedly she is not heavy for her age).  Piggy backs are good for kids <br/>
who are a little bigger and heavier.  Certainly if we were having to walk <br/>
frequently, I&#39;d pull out the pram and push her if she wasn&#39;t wanting to <br/>
walk.  When she was a few years younger, we used to go to the markets each <br/>
week for fresh fruit and veg.  My mum bought a second hand pram to carry our <br/>
fruit and veg, but of course, my then 5yo wanted to ride in it.  It made <br/>
taking her to the markets far more pleasant for her, so my mum and I, and <br/>
later just me when my mum moved away, would push her and our fruit and veg <br/>
around the markets, in a very old pram, on rough dirt.gravel paths.  Was it <br/>
easy?  No.  But my daughter didn&#39;t really want to be there, and was only <br/>
there because of my need.  I could argue that she benefited from the fruit <br/>
and veg too, but still, it was my choice to be there at that time.<br/>
<br/>
Even now, when we&#39;re shopping, she will ride in the trolley rather than walk <br/>
around the shops by herself.  This isn&#39;t to say she doesn&#39;t walk anywhere. <br/>
She loves going on hikes/bushwalks, and has no trouble walking a 3km (about <br/>
2 miles?) track.  But sometimes she doesn&#39;t want to walk.<br/>
<br/>
I can see that you are frustrated by your daughter wanting to do whatever <br/>
you&#39;re not wanting to do at the time (walk when you want to bus, bus when <br/>
you want to walk), rather than just by her not walking, but I think what is <br/>
stressing her (or what would be stressing my daughter in a similar <br/>
situation), is not having a choice in which you do.  Is it possible to leave <br/>
early enough that if your daughter says she wants to walk when you&#39;re at the <br/>
bus stop, you can say OK?  And if she wants to catch the bus on the way <br/>
back, explain that that will mean waiting, and let her sometimes make that <br/>
choice.  Perhaps she will choose to walk anyway after waiting for a bit, <br/>
perhaps not, but I&#39;m willing to bet that if she knows she will be able to <br/>
have a say in which you do, then she will be more willing to work with you <br/>
on finding solutions.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds to me like you have made a decision about how it is to be done, <br/>
and you&#39;re not willing to budge, for any reason.  I suspect this is what is <br/>
making your daughter so unhappy, rather than the actual fact of either <br/>
walking or taking the bus.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1471732535">I&#39;m wondering if your daughter would like a bit more control. Could you ask her if she really wants to go, and if she does, explain the ways of getting there/home and ask which she would like to do? <br/>
<br/>
I notice she is your eldest isn&#39;t she?, I wonder if she would like to be treated a little bit &#39;grown up&#39;, and get to make the sort of decisions and planning mummy gets to make.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you are over-thinking the potential &#39;problems&#39; (the wait, the late return etc.), at the expense of your daughter&#39;s sense of autonomy and choice?<br/>
<br/>
I also just thought about a scooter, my son loves his and it&#39;s easy to carry and take on buses when he&#39;s had enough. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-241471584">I&#39;m not sure how to quote things on my phone, but your response about having<br/>
2 children younger than the 5yo doesn&#39;t change the fact that she&#39;s only 5.<br/>
My husband and I decided to have a large family, but we agreed that it was<br/>
still important to keep a small family mentality, meaning that we needed to<br/>
find joyful ways to be with all our kids and not take away from their<br/>
experiences because they had younger sibs. We&#39;ve travel all over the US, do<br/>
lots of theme parks and other day to day activities that many would see<br/>
reserved for those with 1 or 2 or 3 kids.<br/>
I have had a quad stroller, triple stroller, double with a walking child<br/>
seat and many slings and backpacks.  Right now we usually use our triple,<br/>
but often 2 or more seats are empty for most of the trip. It sure is useful<br/>
to have them instead of making littles walk though.<br/>
My sil has always made 4yo her cutoff for stroller use, and they  hardly<br/>
ever want to go anywhere because the kids complain too much.  She chooses<br/>
not go many places with us because she says it&#39;s about her and how much she<br/>
can handle and not the kids.  They really do miss out on a lot because they<br/>
have shifted the focus from fun to arbitrary social norms for stroller use,<br/>
carrying, ect.<br/>

Things that would take a 10 minute drive now take leaving 20 minutes early to get to the bus stop, and sometimes nearly an hour on the bus and then doing it all again on the way back.

 </span></blockquote>Are you sure that pushing a double buggy with two children and a bag in the<br/>
bottom with a baby on your back would be harder than carrying two children<br/>
and a bag? I always found it much easier to take the buggy than to carry<br/>
more than one child - I have sometimes had three children sitting one in<br/>
front of the other in my single buggy (with the seat laid flat) plus bags<br/>
and coats in the bottom; even when I was pregnant with the fourth that was<br/>
easier than trying to carry everything and everyone. On one or two occasions<br/>
I&#39;ve had all four of them in the buggy, even when the eldest was 8 or 9.<br/>
<br/>
If a buggy is out of the question I would second the suggestion of a<br/>
scooter; if you can&#39;t afford one you could try looking on Freecycle.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing you could try maybe is to find somewhere to sit and rest for<br/>
half an hour after the lesson, with a drink and a snack, before walking<br/>
home. Even if your child can manage the distance, it may be too much on top<br/>
of a dancing or gymnastics lesson, so finding somewhere to rest in between<br/>
might make a difference.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-252265513">===Would an alphabet walk be where you try to find the letters on signs and license plates?====<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
I carry a small notebook that fits in the back pocket of my jeans with all sorts of different games. It&#39;s an old habit of mine from being a play leader for my city&#39;s parks and recreation department when I was in my late teens. Maybe you can get books such as the following from the library for inspiration:<br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s often fantastic game ideas suggested on this list and I try to note them in my little book. <br/>
<br/>
The advice I got when I was training to be a play leader was to keep the games light, playful, imaginative and fun. And to change the game as soon as the enthusiasm shows signs of waning. It&#39;s good advice that has helped me with unschooling too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-102557541">======Just because a child can read, sometimes parents stop reading to them.   <br/>
Because a child can read Hop on Pop, the parent won&#39;t read Treasure Island to <br/>
him.  Sometimes a three year old can walk a long way, for a three year old, but <br/>
for her to learn that her mother will never carry her again seems harsh.  Not <br/>
even in a stroller?=========<br/>
<br/>
I do carry my three year old when she needs me to.  I just did it yesterday with <br/>
the baby on my back and a heavy bag in my arms while my 5 year old lagged behind <br/>
complaining about how hard it was to walk.  <br/>
<br/>
-------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
For a 5 year old it is hard to walk. Even if for you it was harder, you were <br/>
choosing, fully choosing your actions. Your 5 year old was marching to your <br/>
drummer. Your 5 year old didn&#39;t make you have a 3 year old or another baby. Your <br/>
5 year old may have been happier if you&#39;d stopped with her.  You&#39;ve made a bunch <br/>
of choices that aren&#39;t her choices and then you tell her given the choices I&#39;ve <br/>
made you have to live this life. And you resent her for not carrying on in good <br/>
style alongside you. Instead of hating all the weight that you were hauling, <br/>
could you have taken more breaks? Could you have talked about how heavy <br/>
everything is and how sometimes it&#39;s hard for you to walk, too? Shared the moan <br/>
with your daughters, your 3 year old and your 5 year old. Sorted through the bag <br/>
and figured out what weighed the most and moaned about that thing. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
5 seems so young when my children are 14 and 11. I can remember, though, that <br/>
Simon seemed old enough at 5 when Linnaea was 2. Sort of punishment for him that <br/>
because he was relatively older I was expecting him to be absolutely older. <br/>
Things were much better when I saw that he was ready to do what he was ready to <br/>
do and that however old he was didn&#39;t come into it. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Can you go out less? Can you get things delivered? Can you think bigger than if <br/>
I can carry a baby, a 3 year old and a heavy bag she can at least walk? <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2054074682">If she loves the dance class she may well be fine doing that after walking there as she enjoys it. It is still a walk one way and a class but the fun bit is after the walk rather than being faced by a walk after the class.<br/>
Getting home 2 hours later may seem frustrating if you concentrate on the fact that you could get home in 20 mins. However if you see the 2 hrs as an activity in itself maybe less so.<br/>
Maybe she will just be happy that you have let her do it her way and never need to do it again. Maybe she will love it and it will be easier for all of you.<br/>
Perhaps doing it for the dance would be enough and if there is no bus home at all after gymnastics you could do it her way for dance and the other way for gymnastics. If you are accomodating her on the journey where that is possible she may find it easier to accept the journey where it is not possible. She may not.<br/>
You won&#39;t know unless you start to try out some of her plans where you can do so.<br/>
I think you may find she is very attached to her plan because you haven&#39;t ler her try it out. Having tried it out you may find she doesn&#39;t want to do it every time and you may find that she moves on to new ideas and plans once she has tried out this version.<br/>
I can easily revisit times in my past when my parents wouldn&#39;t let me try my way of doing things and wanted me to think of other ideas. It made no sense to me as I could see no valid (to me) reason why we couldn&#39;t try my plan except they didn&#39;t want to. It frustrated me that their not wanting to trumped my not wanting to do it their way on a regular basis. It wasn&#39;t conducive to me looking for other ideas.<br/>
The gymnastics may make it impossible to get a bus back but it seems it is possible to do it your daughters way on the dance class days.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I am confused by why u have to take the bus there if it&#39;s walking distance<br/>
&gt; &gt; and walk back if there&#39;s a bus?  lyla<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Because if we walk there, they will be tired during the class and even more exhausted on the walk home.  When my husband can come with us, we do walk there if they want to and we bring the wagon.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; After gymnastics, the bus does not run that late.  After dance, the timing would mean getting home 2 hours after class gets out (and still walking home from the bus stop) rather than walking and getting home in 20 minutes.<br/>

It strikes me that Tess may be right; when my kids are unsettled about something they&#39;ll sometimes make rather irrational sounding complaints or keep switching the complaint so I can&#39;t possibly help. I try to look at it as a request for help with big exclamation points rather than complaining or whining. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking maybe a really genuine hug or whatever sort of interaction your daughter finds most soothing may help more than words. When she&#39;s more calm maybe she&#39;ll be ready to share what&#39;s really bothering her if she feels you&#39;re on her side.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with the suggestions of a stroller; ours makes all the difference for my 4 yr old twins, their stuff, my stuff.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s great that you carried your kids for so long, but it may help to shift attention to being grateful for your ability to do so. Your words make it sounds more of a burden. I still carry my two kids when they request it. It makes me happy to help them feel secure and they smell so darn good. :)</div>

I brought that from a friend&#39;s daily mailing, to set next to this:<br/>
<br/>
-=-You are probably right. I am really feeling the inconvenience of not having a car. Things that would take a 10 minute drive now take leaving 20 minutes early to get to the bus stop, and sometimes nearly an hour on the bus and then doing it all again on the way back. So I&#39;ve been making the choices that take into consideration all the factors and try to make it *easiest* on all of us, regardless of what we *want* to do. With most things, I do take everyone&#39;s desires into account, but I guess I&#39;m not being very flexible about this. -=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot; try to make it *easiest* on all of us, regardless of what we *want* to do.&quot; doesn&#39;t sound fun at all.  The dance class probably isn&#39;t worth four people doing something that is NOT easy, that they do NOT want to do.<br/>
<br/>
All the resentment poured toward a child will come flooding back out of them someday.  All the love and compassion will make the better, happier and stronger.  <br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have a car, that&#39;s true.  You have a daughter who can walk, and dance.  What about dancing to DVDs or Youtube videos instead of an inaccessible dance class?  Winter is coming.  Won&#39;t that all get worse? <br/>
<br/>
Maybe when you do have a car you could take her to a dance class.  Or maybe you could find another dance class right near a bus stop, at a better time.<br/>
<br/>
Joy and peace should be higher priorities than any dance class.<br/>
