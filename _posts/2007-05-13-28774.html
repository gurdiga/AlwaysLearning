<div id="ygrps-yiv-643273704">Holly&#39;s musical preferences, from her MySpace profile:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
These days:<br/>
Cute is what we aim for, The Killers, Bloodhound gang, The Darkness,  <br/>
bowling for soup, panic! at the disco, Nickleback, A, Shaimus,  <br/>
DragonForce<br/>
Those days:<br/>
Prince, Meatloaf, Michael Jackson, Cyndi Lauper, Wham!, Bon Jovi,  <br/>
Billy Joel<br/>
Those other days:<br/>
Herman&#39;s Hermits, Bob Dylan, The Turtles, Frankie Valli, Beach Boys,  <br/>
Petula Clark, Donovan<br/>
<br/>
=================================================<br/>
<br/>
I loved this.<br/>
I liked the choices, I like that she knows about those performers  <br/>
(sometimes partly because of me, sometimes not at all), and I like  <br/>
the way she arranged and labelled them.  &quot;Those Days&quot; is the 80&#39;s. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Evidence of how my children organize their thoughts and memories and  <br/>
preferences has always fascinated me.  How I know what they know,  <br/>
what they&#39;re thinking, what they like, is part of what I know about  <br/>
them.  The fact that they will express preferences without self- <br/>
consciousness or fear is wonderful.<br/>

&gt; Sandra<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s fascinating and cool that my kids think and organize their world <br/>
soooooo differently than I do.  It expands my own thinking all the <br/>
time, just trying to get where they are coming from and seeing how <br/>
they process their world.<br/>
<br/>
We just got set up with DDR at our house and have been loving it so <br/>
much!  Chamille and John routinely beat me at it.  Margaux just got <br/>
brave enough to try it out this weekend.  I love watching how my kids <br/>
figure out how to play it.  They both have completely different <br/>
strategies on how to use their feet.  <br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t even begin to do what Chamille does.  It&#39;s this technique <br/>
of light hopping and sliding across the mat trying to minimize <br/>
changing feet, so she does combos with one side then the other side <br/>
quickly changing sides.  It&#39;s hard to describe.<br/>
<br/>
I like doing every other foot weight changing often from right to <br/>
left, so seeing what Chamille does, just seems really extraordinary.  <br/>
It&#39;s not just that either, it&#39;s this eye body coordination that she <br/>
is really skilled at.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve studied movement for many years, so this sort of thing <br/>
fascinates me.  It&#39;s a different way of processing what she&#39;s seeing <br/>
into a physical manifestation in such an interesting way, that I <br/>
never would have considered trying for myself.  When I do try to do <br/>
what she does, it trips me up, for some reason I can&#39;t seem to get my <br/>
own body to follow the patterns like she does. <br/>
<br/>
It directly relates to how she follows patterns in general, and what <br/>
makes her way of doing things special and unique, and how when I show <br/>
her how I would do it, it doesn&#39;t make any sense at all to her.  I <br/>
get little glimses into her way of thinking and organizing of data <br/>
and ideas all the time.  She&#39;s so clever and creative, and I&#39;m so <br/>
glad that I never tried to make her do things differently!</div>

She really does.  She&#39;s an excellent advisor on whether I would like  <br/>
something or not, too.<br/>

<br/>
Instead of responding to the post this came from, I went back to the  <br/>
original.  Yahoogroups is arranged in such a way now that at the  <br/>
bottom of each e-mail (maybe only for those who opted for html e- <br/>
mail, I&#39;m not sure) there&#39;s a link to the whole thread.  So I think  <br/>
if you click &quot;messages in this topic&quot; at the bottom of this e-mail,  <br/>
you&#39;ll get to the whole thread, except those where people just  <br/>
started a new e-mail and cut and pasted the subject line (or whatever).<br/>
<br/>
In case that doesn&#39;t work for every e-mail option, here&#39;s her music  <br/>
list:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1168870188">Oh!  It worked, even though (falsely) the note at the bottom of my e- <br/>
mail says there were 0 items.  There are several. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Holly had a beautiful myspace format the other day.  Very elegant,  <br/>
with a long vertical photo of her with the options to do various  <br/>
things superimposed on it.  Kirby and I had admired it a few nights  <br/>
before, and when I told her it was wonderful, she said &quot;Oh, I changed  <br/>
that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I get attached.  I wish I had printed it out.  I have sometimes  <br/>
printed out HTML things she&#39;s done.  But that one&#39;s gone now.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ah...<br/>
New html I&#39;ve done.  Not NEARLY pretty like Holly&#39;s, but useful to  <br/>
unschoolers:<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That happens here all the time!  Chamille changes her myspace several <br/>
times a week.  Some are better than others, but they are always cool <br/>
and inventive with layers and such.  What I really like about it is <br/>
that it&#39;s like a work of art that you never have to finish, you can <br/>
keep editing and changing.  She learns something new everyday!  She <br/>
recently learned how to make those little button things. <br/>
<br/>
I asked her to make one for me, but she hasn&#39;t yet, because I want a <br/>
certain picture that is on my computer and I can&#39;t seem to get it to <br/>
her.  I think I&#39;ll work on that today!</div>
