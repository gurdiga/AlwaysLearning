<div id="ygrps-yiv-1139433271">VT: Can you leave us with one of your favorite insults from the book?<br/>
<br/>
SD: There&#39;s the Icelandic word prumphænsn, which means &#39;fart-chicken.&#39;  <br/>
Its glorious unexpectedness is half the fun. Fart-chicken!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the end of an interview with one of the authors of a new book :<br/>
<br/>
Want to insult someone in Japanese? Try misokakku (&#39;scum of soya  <br/>
paste&#39;). In Polish, try motyla noga (&#39;butterfly&#39;s leg&#39;), and in  <br/>
Turkish, muhallebi çocuğu(&#39;child of pudding&#39;). These and hundreds of  <br/>
other colorful put-downs from around the world can be found in the  <br/>
delightful new book, Uglier Than a Monkey&#39;s Armpit by Stephen Dodson  <br/>
and Dr. Robert Vanderplank. We spoke about the book with Dodson, known  <br/>
to many language lovers by his nom de blog, Languagehat.<br/>
