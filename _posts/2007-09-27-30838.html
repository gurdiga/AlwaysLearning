Something philosophical/mushy I wrote yesterday, and a mystery photo.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had a different couple of weeks--busy and good and stressful and  <br/>
weird.  I wanted to apologize because I&#39;m about to be away from home  <br/>
for eight days (conference in Minnesota and visiting with Kelli  <br/>
Traaseth&#39;s family), and there are things I had on my list to do that  <br/>
won&#39;t be finished.   I have some good comments from Betsy to add to  <br/>
the unschooling panel responses that followed on the HSC conference.   <br/>
I meant to send some wolf stuff to a little girl; that will happen  <br/>
but not so soon.  For the connections stuff, I mean to add some pages  <br/>
to my website (and thanks for the photos I was sent yesterday).<br/>
<br/>
When the webpages are finished, sometime in October I hope, they&#39;ll  <br/>
be announced two places:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com/">http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
and<br/>
<br/>
on an e-mail list which can be subscribed to (for those who prefer e- <br/>
mail to blogs) by sending an e-mail to<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:SandraDodd-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">SandraDodd-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>
<br/>
or going to<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/sandradodd/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/sandradodd/</a><br/>
<br/>
If anyone has a good connections story to share, or a blogpost I  <br/>
might link to when I get that going, please let me know.  For now,  <br/>
there are some older things already online at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/">http://sandradodd.com/</a> <br/>
connections (halfway down that page other peoples stories are).<br/>
