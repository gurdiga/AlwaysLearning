When you sit down and actually play them it doesn&#39;t seem so bad<br/>
I don&#39;t object to the content in any videa games, this just reminded me of a <br/>
conversation that Zack (17 in 3 1/2 weeks!) and I had the other day. I do sit <br/>
down and watch games with him, I find GTA to be an incredibly righ &quot;learning&quot; <br/>
experience, not to mention fun and funny. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Zack asked me to buy a mini-notebook to write down his cheat codes. <br/>
If you are unfamiliar with them they consist of pressing certain buttons in a <br/>
certain sequence - right, x, triangle, left, up, down, down, etc etc. There are <br/>
usually 7-10 buttons in a sequence. For many of thse cheat codes, he <br/>
memorizes the sequence and can do them very quickly, which is important in the game. <br/>
As he starts to write the codes down, I notice him shaking his head, crossing <br/>
things out, and sighing with frustration. &quot;Argh! I can&#39;t remember the codes!&quot; <br/>
So I asked, &quot;are you writing down codes that you know from the game?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Yes.<br/>
&quot;Are these the codes that you can do automatically?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Yeah.&quot;<br/>
So I think for a minute, a connection is going on in my head.<br/>
&quot;When you do the codes, are you thinking what buttons to push or are you <br/>
doing it by feel?&quot;<br/>
&quot;No, I don&#39;t think about which buttons to push, I just push them&quot;<br/>
AHA!!!!<br/>
&quot;I figured it out Zack, I know why you do so well and I stink at those games! <br/>
Everytime I push a button, I have to think, &#39;which button?&#39;, look for it and <br/>
then push it!&quot;<br/>
And here I thought I was just a bad driver. LOL<br/>
I&#39;ve seen people at registers that never look down at the keyboard. I&#39;ve seen <br/>
typists that type 100 wpm without a mistake or a glance at the keyboard, Zack <br/>
may very well be like that. I&#39;ll have to watch him type next time he&#39;s on the <br/>
computer. <br/>
Well, there&#39;s probably no point to the story, just a story about making <br/>
connections.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1725659084">&quot;My son just plays on the computer all day and <br/>
night long.&quot;<br/>
   <br/>
  My son does as well and sometimes it bothers me and sometimes to my disappointment I even say something.  That is until about 2 weeks ago and we were talking about something and I realized that he knew alot of things that I don&#39;t know, so that was all it took, he is getting very smart somehow.  Also with most of the MMORPG&#39;s there is a lot of math that has to be done quickly so that you make the right decission.  He can do math in his head like nobody.<br/>
   <br/>
  Don&#39;t be bothered by the games.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-14296705">That is what he&#39;s really into... why is the sad?  I think it&#39;s great he&#39;s so<br/>
passionate about something.  You know, he&#39;s working out and visualizing what<br/>
he&#39;s going to do next in his game when he&#39;s not actually playing.  Those are<br/>
great thinking skills!  Not everyone finds it easy to visualize the outcome<br/>
they are seeking.  Please don&#39;t make him feel that there&#39;s anything wrong<br/>
with him for having his passion be video games.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-849505815">I used to restrict the time my kids spent on games - computer and <br/>
Playstation - but haven&#39;t done so for years now. My oldest son - the one <br/>
most retricted in that sort of play and many others - no guns, no this <br/>
no that.... - grew up the most inclined to violence and such - not to <br/>
say he&#39;s vioent, but much more interested in boxing, guns etc. than the <br/>
kids that follwed.<br/>
<br/>
Right now I&#39;m sitting in our sitting room with 9 homeschooled / some <br/>
unschooled boys aged 13 - 23, ten computers (I&#39;m allowed one!). One son <br/>
was here last night but is working tonight. They are having a LAN party. <br/>
Three are ethical, vegetarian, atheists. 5 are serious christians. That <br/>
leaves the youngest who is atheist but not vegetarian. These are among <br/>
the nicest, most ethical young people I know. I&#39;m 55 and apart from my <br/>
sons, who I love to bits and who I regard as friends, there is another <br/>
who I count among my closest friends. And all of them are just really <br/>
cool people. One 15 year old danced with me at a public dance for 2 1/2 <br/>
hours the other night with no embarrassment - he needed a danced partner <br/>
(ceroc) and I was there, so he danced with me.<br/>
<br/>
They have been playing kill em shoot em games since 10pm Friday night <br/>
(New Zealand time - were into Saturday night here already) and will be <br/>
here till Sunday afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
Forget the broken heart. Your son is who he is, rejoyce is his being. If <br/>
you don&#39;t make him feel bad about himself by disapproving of something <br/>
he loves, he&#39;ll be cool. Love him for who he is now, not who you <br/>
imagined he would be.<br/>
<br/>
These kids here - they&#39;re cool. I just love these kids. Couldn&#39;t ask for <br/>
better.<br/>

<br/>
Have you played the games? Have you talked with him about the games? Yesterday Simon and Linnaea and I were playing X-Men 2 on our gamecube and they think alot about what they are doing. It looks very blunt instrumenty, but as their characters go up levels they have to distribute skill points based on what they want those characters to be strong in. So if you want Magneto to be more mentally powerful spending more points on focus is a good plan, but you don&#39;t really worry about making Colossus smart. After Simon has been intensely focusing on a game, he will run it out. Literally, he runs back and forth shooting and talking as he goes working through whatever has just happened and incorporating aspects of the game into a story. Sometimes he tells me the stories he&#39;s creating, and they are amazing. He weaves the most amazing details using whatever game he&#39;s been playing, or television show he&#39;s been watching as a backdrop. Don&#39;t dismiss what you don&#39;t know. Play the game, there is way more strategy and complex thinking going on than just viewing them may suggest. Certainly there is enough going on to keep your son&#39;s neurons firing for long after he&#39;s walked away from the game. And by suggesting that there is nothing going on in the game, you are slighting your son and his ability to find interesting things to do. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I take him places to get away from the video games&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Your sole purpose in taking him places is getting him away from video games? Really? Do you honestly mean that? Maybe you need to think about how you are approaching these games. It sounds like they are having a more negative influence on your life than on your son&#39;s life. If it is breaking your heart, why? Why can your heart be broken by your son&#39;s enjoyment of video games? I can understand feeling left out because of video games. Simon has definitely achieved a level of skill that I cannot keep up with, or, at least, that I haven&#39;t kept up with. He and Linnaea can spot things in a video game that I would miss. Their ability to pay attention to what seem minor things to me, but what turn out to be pivotal plot points in game or in cut scene, makes them much better gamers than I am. But really, being heartbroken because your son has an interest that you don&#39;t share seems a bit, well, melodramatic. Do you have interests he doesn&#39;t share? Do you do things that aren&#39;t about him? <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve just started saying yes to video games when before you were saying no, right? The last e-mail you sent was about 10 days ago. Give it time. Find something else to do while he works through the games, actually, sit and play with him. If you have a game system, get a second controller and a game that you can play with him and join in. But let him trust that you aren&#39;t going to start saying no again. It wil take a while for the novelty to wear off. Just like with anything else novel. <br/>
<br/>
It seems that you see this as a passive enterprise. I&#39;ve watched ants for hours. Heck E.O. Wilson has watched ants for years. If you were to stumble upon him in the jungles of Brazil it wouldn&#39;t seem like he was doing anything, except swatting flies, probably. It looks so incredibly passive from the outside. But a lot is going on that you can&#39;t see, that you can&#39;t judge. And video games are a lot more actively engaging than watching ants or birds or a badger sett. At least from the outside looking in.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1806470452">Thanks for your response Schuyler . This whole video thing is such <br/>
challenge for me.<br/>
Calling my feeling of Heartbrokenness melodramatic is, well, a <br/>
judgement  isn&#39;t it?  Perhaps the word &quot;heartbroken&quot; is actually an <br/>
interpretation of a deep feeling of sadness and that is what is present <br/>
when I observe my son&#39;s constant playing of video games. If my son were <br/>
spending hours watching birds or ants I would feel joyful because I <br/>
have a belief that a deep connection with nature can lead us to an <br/>
understanding of ourselves and how we fit into the ecology of the <br/>
planet. I trust nature&#39;s influence on my son. I don;t know much about <br/>
the person that created the video game that leaves such a powerful <br/>
impression on my son. Am I to trust that because he is drawn to  it <br/>
that it is good. That is an awakening for me - to trust that my son <br/>
does know what is best for him. I have trouble with that because he has <br/>
a huge attraction to sugar and eats way more  of if it than I feel is <br/>
healthy - so do I trust that sugar is good for him because he wants to <br/>
eat so much of it?<br/>

&gt; there is nothing going on in the game, you are slighting your son and <br/>
&gt; his ability to find interesting things to do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;I take him places to get away from the video games&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Your sole purpose in taking him places is getting him away from video <br/>
&gt; games? Really? Do you honestly mean that? Maybe you need to think <br/>
&gt; about how you are approaching these games. It sounds like they are <br/>
&gt; having a more negative influence on your life than on your son&#39;s life. <br/>
&gt; If it is breaking your heart, why? Why can your heart be broken by <br/>
&gt; your son&#39;s enjoyment of video games? I can understand feeling left out <br/>
&gt; because of video games. Simon has definitely achieved a level of skill <br/>
&gt; that I cannot keep up with, or, at least, that I haven&#39;t kept up with. <br/>
&gt; He and Linnaea can spot things in a video game that I would miss. <br/>
&gt; Their ability to pay attention to what seem minor things to me, but <br/>
&gt; what turn out to be pivotal plot points in game or in cut scene, makes <br/>
&gt; them much better gamers than I am. But really, being heartbroken <br/>
&gt; because your son has an interest that you don&#39;t share seems a bit, <br/>
&gt; well, melodramatic. Do you have interests he doesn&#39;t share? Do you do <br/>
&gt; things that aren&#39;t about him?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You&#39;ve just started saying yes to video games when before you were <br/>
&gt; saying no, right? The last e-mail you sent was about 10 days ago. Give <br/>
&gt; it time. Find something else to do while he works through the games, <br/>
&gt; actually, sit and play with him. If you have a game system, get a <br/>
&gt; second controller and a game that you can play with him and join in. <br/>
&gt; But let him trust that you aren&#39;t going to start saying no again. It <br/>
&gt; wil take a while for the novelty to wear off. Just like with anything <br/>
&gt; else novel.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It seems that you see this as a passive enterprise. I&#39;ve watched ants <br/>
&gt; for hours. Heck E.O. Wilson has watched ants for years. If you were to <br/>
&gt; stumble upon him in the jungles of Brazil it wouldn&#39;t seem like he was <br/>
&gt; doing anything, except swatting flies, probably. It looks so <br/>
&gt; incredibly passive from the outside. But a lot is going on that you <br/>
&gt; can&#39;t see, that you can&#39;t judge. And video games are a lot more <br/>
&gt; actively engaging than watching ants or birds or a badger sett. At <br/>
&gt; least from the outside looking in.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-18781940">Have you ever played the games? Usually when people say that it&#39;s  <br/>
because they&#39;ve not played the games. They say they don&#39;t have the  <br/>
time, or that the games are too hard, and then simultaneously say  <br/>
that the kids aren&#39;t &#39;learning&#39; anything. Maybe instead of watching,  <br/>
you should be doing with him...and being his partner. And understand  <br/>
that everything has it&#39;s season. &quot;hours&quot; of video games is  <br/>
subjective, for some people it&#39;s one hour that&#39;s too much, for  <br/>
others, twelve. With my kids if they are interrupted, they need to  <br/>
start over to get that same feeling back.  It messes up their groove,  <br/>
kwim?<br/>
<br/>
I know it&#39;s been addressed, and Sandra&#39;s websites are very good  <br/>
resources for this. I wanted to respond though because you sound so  <br/>
concerned, and let you know that video games have been instrumental  <br/>
in our household, opening conversations about good vs evil, politics,  <br/>
history, economics. We just have plain old fun being together,  <br/>
regardless of what we&#39;re doing. I don&#39;t like all the games that the  <br/>
kids play, but that&#39;s okay, we aren&#39;t all meant to be alike. They  <br/>
don&#39;t like all the games I like. Scrabble for GBA bores them to  <br/>
tears. But most of the games we play together and it&#39;s fun no matter  <br/>
what.<br/>
<br/>
You might read &#39;Killing the Monster&#39;, by Gerard Jones. It explains  <br/>
why children need the opportunity to fight monsters and destroy them.  <br/>
Developmentally it&#39;s an important step.<br/>
<br/>
You might also see what else you can provide in the home. Movies,  <br/>
computer games, books about video games (esp cheat codes, man those  <br/>
are great in our house) Trips to the comic book store, hobby shop,  <br/>
etc can provide more stuff in the house.  What other outside  <br/>
activities do you do beside be &#39;in nature&#39;? Being exposed to new  <br/>
stuff is what will generate new interests.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1275275264">-=-Forget the broken heart. Your son is who he is, rejoyce is his  <br/>
being. If<br/>
you don&#39;t make him feel bad about himself by disapproving of something<br/>
he loves, he&#39;ll be cool.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Kirby, who&#39;s 20 now, still lives at home.  He made motions to move  <br/>
out last winter, but we talked him out of it because he couldn&#39;t  <br/>
really afford it, and was bowing to pressure from already-out young  <br/>
adults who needed a roommate.  They had been paying rent anyway.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s running a game called &quot;Killer.&quot;  I described it here: http:// <br/>
sandradodd.com/blogspot.com<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about over; only two players remained last night.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I was really, really furious at him, and shamed him and  <br/>
told him he was disrespectful, inconsiderate, irresponsible and could  <br/>
potentially cause someone&#39;s death if he didn&#39;t find some way to do  <br/>
differently and better, and that he had a good situation, isn&#39;t even  <br/>
being asked to pay for his own liability insurance, not making car  <br/>
payments, and that he has found some way to be happy not caring at  <br/>
ALL what I think or say.<br/>
<br/>
That went on for twenty minutes, in the garage, and at the end I just  <br/>
turned and walked away.<br/>
<br/>
That was the worst violence of any sort at our house for a long time,  <br/>
me haranguing him.<br/>
<br/>
I was disapproving of something he loves, which is to wait until the  <br/>
gas tank is as empty as possible before getting gas.  He called me at  <br/>
4:45 on a Friday afternoon to drive ten miles TOWARD the opening day  <br/>
of the balloon fiesta because he had run out of gas in a double left  <br/>
turn lane at Wyoming and Paseo del Norte.  For those who were in  <br/>
Albuquerque recently, that&#39;s the intersection near the Dion&#39;s where  <br/>
he works, nearly to Trader Joe&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
I was furious.  I was angry.  Marty had wanted to drive that car  <br/>
Monday, and mentioned that there wasn&#39;t enough gas.  Kirby says he  <br/>
didn&#39;t hear it.  That&#39;s possible.  Wednesday Marty wanted to drive it  <br/>
and there was LESS gas.  He did say something clearly, and I repeated  <br/>
it.  Thursday Kirby hadn&#39;t gotten gas.  He assured me he was going  <br/>
out later and would get gas.  Keith and I were going to costco to gas  <br/>
my van, and Keith asked me if I wanted to drive the Saturn and I said  <br/>
&quot;Kirby&#39;s going out later and will gas it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
THAT was the clincher.  AND the last two times that car had been  <br/>
filled were by Marty (with his money) and Keith (with his).<br/>
<br/>
Friday morning when Kirby was going to work, I said &quot;Hurry so you can  <br/>
get gas on the way.  You said you were going to.&quot;   He muttered  <br/>
something that I assumed would be agreement.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing about the Killer game caused anyone the least bit of  <br/>
discomfort or unhappiness.  It involved logic, creativity and  <br/>
relationship building.  Holly was eliminated early on, but got to  <br/>
design and help maintain their cool webpage.  Others got to be  <br/>
impressed by her artistry, knowledge and efficiency.<br/>
<br/>
For running the game for 18 or so people, he was fantastic.<br/>
For procrastinating about running out of gas  he was unsafe,  <br/>
inconsiderate and wasteful of other people&#39;s time and safety.<br/>
<br/>
Playing video games, or even in-person &quot;shoot &#39;em up&quot; games, isn&#39;t  <br/>
violence.<br/>
Separating someone from something he loves is more violent to spirit  <br/>
and desire.<br/>

theirs.   Let love and happiness and joy and learning be big in your  <br/>

<br/>
Holly has been playing two games lately, in her off time when others  <br/>
aren&#39;t around:  Zombies Ate my Neighbors, and Harvest Moon.<br/>
<br/>
I should say for those who know gaming systems that we have everyting  <br/>
except Sega and Atari.  We have XBox and PSII and XBox 360 and  <br/>
Nintendo DS.    So what Holly&#39;s doing, in a way, is riding a scooter  <br/>
and driving a VW Bug with a Jaguar and a Porsche in the driveway.    <br/>
Of all the games to which she  has access, she&#39;s playing a Super  <br/>
Nintendo game about zombies running around in a neighborhood, and a  <br/>
Gameboy game (barely in color, &quot;colorized&quot;) about farming, having  <br/>
your cows calve, and gathering your crops.<br/>

Kirby learned to read with Nintendo Power magazine, to which he  <br/>
subscribed when he could only understand the maps and pictures.<br/>
<br/>
Marty learned to read with a player&#39;s guide for Breath of Fire III.<br/>
<br/>
Holly learned to read with a Harry Potter collectible card game and  <br/>
Harvest Moon for Super Nintendo (fancier than the one she&#39;s playing  <br/>
on gameboy nowadays, and less fancy than the one she played on  <br/>
Gamecube for a long time after that).<br/>
<br/>
My  kids have played lots of games, and are peaceful, gentle people,  <br/>

experiences outside of video games, sometimes with friends they met  <br/>

If they&#39;re being &quot;exposed&quot; to new stuff just to generate new  <br/>

<br/>
Wanting kids to do what mom envisioned her own ideal childhood to be  <br/>

WOW... we sure have a lot of newbies lately (here and on unschoolingbasics)<br/>
that don&#39;t like to be judged!  Why the fear of being judged?  What you all<br/>
don&#39;t understand is that these issues you&#39;re addressing are NOT NEW around<br/>
here.  We&#39;ve heard it all before.  And those who listen and trust and begin<br/>
to make changes actually come back and say... &quot;you know... you were right...<br/>
blah, blah, blah.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was a bit defensive at first but I really took heart of what everyone was<br/>
saying and really questioned why I was getting defensive.  Maybe you all<br/>
might want to do the same.<br/>

<br/>
Robyn Coburn gave me a very cook book called The Little Princesses,  <br/>
and it&#39;s the account of the governess of Elizabeth (now Queen) and  <br/>
Margaret, when they were little girls, before their dad had any idea  <br/>
he might ever be king.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The account of the first time she met Elizabeth, who was five years  <br/>
old or so, is this:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;A small figure with a mop of curls sat up in bed.  She wore a  <br/>
nightie with a  design of small pink roses on it.  She had tied the  <br/>
cords of her dressing gown to the knobs of the old-fashioned bed, and  <br/>
was busy driving her team.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;That was my first glimpse of Princess Elizabeth.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;&#39;This is Miss Craword,&#39;: said [the nanny], in her sterm way.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The little girl said, &#39;How do you do.&#39;. . . .<br/>
<br/>
&quot;She picked up her reins again.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;&#39;Do you usually drive in bed?&#39; I asked.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;&#39;I mostly go once or twice round the park before I go to sleep, you  <br/>
know,&#39; she said.  &#39;It exercises my horses.&#39;  She navigated a  <br/>
dangerous and difficult corner, and went on...  &#39;Are you going to  <br/>
stay with us?&#39; &quot;<br/>
<br/>
My sister used to play flute, with her fingers, in the absence of her  <br/>
flute.  I&#39;ve tapped out songs on a keyboard that wasn&#39;t there, with  <br/>
one hand, when I was trying to write out music and trying to figure  <br/>
out what some interval was.  My hand knows.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tapped out phone numbers on invisible phones because it&#39;s a  <br/>
muscle memory, not a verbal/numeric memory.<br/>

If we look at ideas without sorting them into better and worse, how  <br/>
can we think at all?<br/>
How can we help you figure out how to unschool better without talking  <br/>
about the ideas you have now?<br/>
<br/>
If all the ideas in the world are equal, why have discussions at all?<br/>

-=-Perhaps the word &quot;heartbroken&quot; is actually an<br/>
interpretation of a deep feeling of sadness and that is what is present<br/>
when I observe my son&#39;s constant playing of video games.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Had you called it grief or discomfort or sadness, people would still  <br/>
have said &quot;get over it,&quot; and it still would have seemed melodramatic.<br/>
<br/>
-=- If my son were<br/>
spending hours watching birds or ants I would feel joyful because I<br/>
have a belief that a deep connection with nature can lead us to an<br/>
understanding of ourselves and how we fit into the ecology of the<br/>
planet.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If your joy and  your heartbreak are contingent on his actions,  <br/>
you&#39;re not in a healthy place regarding your son.  It might help to  <br/>
look at a couple of definitions of codependency.  The clearer you are  <br/>
on your own feelings, the better mom you will be.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I trust nature&#39;s influence on my son.-=-<br/>
<br/>
While that sounds good, it doesn&#39;t really mean much.<br/>
Nature influences people to be violent pretty effectively all around  <br/>
us.  I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re thinking of an idealized peaceful Snow-White- <br/>
with-birds vision of nature, not a coyote killing baby rabbits  <br/>
moment.  One is natural.  One is fantasy.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I don;t know much about<br/>
the person that created the video game that leaves such a powerful<br/>
impression on my son.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Find out.  I&#39;m guessing you didn&#39;t actually follow the links people  <br/>
provided, but if you would consider renting and watching the special  <br/>
that was on PBS about video games, you would know more about many  <br/>
things in the world, and about what kinds of people have the  <br/>
capability and skills and imagination to design those games.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Am I to trust that because he is drawn to  it<br/>
that it is good. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Do you want him to trust you when you say that it&#39;s bad?<br/>
Instead of thinking in terms of &quot;trust,&quot; how about learning, and  <br/>
choices?<br/>

&gt; judgement  isn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sure is. I judge lots of things. Gosh, I can&#39;t count how many I&#39;ve judged <br/>
today. I judged some food as good for the compost and some plastic as not <br/>
recyclable. I judged the weather as a bit cool so I put on a turtleneck. I <br/>
judged the dishes as not clean enough to eat off of, so I put them in a pile <br/>
to be washed. I judged dinner as edible, so I ate it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Perhaps the word &quot;heartbroken&quot; is actually an<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then read Kelly&#39;s words:<br/>
&quot;Change your feelings. They&#39;re yours to change.<br/>
<br/>
Your feelings will not change your child&#39;s. Well, not in a good way.<br/>
Your negative feelings could make him less than or stupid or wasteful.<br/>
Better than your feelings about him and his interests are positive and<br/>
encouraging: he&#39;ll respond positively and encouraged!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If my son were<br/>
&gt; spending hours watching birds or ants I would feel joyful because I<br/>
&gt; have a belief that a deep connection with nature can lead us to an<br/>
&gt; understanding of ourselves and how we fit into the ecology of the<br/>
&gt; planet.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You know you can&#39;t make that deep connection for him, right? You know that a <br/>
deep connection with something, with anything, is a personal thing, not a <br/>
public one, right? So, do you believe that if you exclude all other things, <br/>
if you do as teachers have been known to do, and black the windows so he <br/>
can&#39;t see outside of what you want him to see, he will inevitably forge a <br/>
deep connection with nature? What if by focusing on nature at the exclusion <br/>
of other things he enjoys you end up making him see nature as an oppressive, <br/>
negative experience?<br/>
<br/>
And to clarify, my example of ant watching and bird watching was to <br/>
demonstrate that what may seem like sitting still and staring at nothing may <br/>
be a very deep and thoughtful experience.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I trust nature&#39;s influence on my son.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nature&#39;s a pretty big thing to trust without examining that trust. If a puma <br/>
were coming towards me, I wouldn&#39;t trust its influence, or that of diptheria <br/>
or botflies. Every month nature tells me that I should get pregnant, unless <br/>
I already am. But I don&#39;t trust that, I trust far more my feeling that two <br/>
children is what I want right now.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don;t know much about<br/>
&gt; the person that created the video game that leaves such a powerful<br/>
&gt; impression on my son.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you watch the game, if you play the game, you will know far more about <br/>
the impression it is making. And even something about the perspective of the <br/>
creator.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Am I to trust that because he is drawn to  it<br/>
&gt; that it is good.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What I am suggesting you trust is that your son knows when something is <br/>
interesting. You are arguing that there is no value in video games. Your son <br/>
definitely has found something valuable in video games. Maybe you should <br/>
examine the thing that he finds valuable before dismissing it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have trouble with that because he has<br/>
&gt; a huge attraction to sugar and eats way more  of if it than I feel is<br/>
&gt; healthy - so do I trust that sugar is good for him because he wants to<br/>
&gt; eat so much of it?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, but that is a whole &#39;nother ball of wax and Linnaea wants me to come <br/>
put her to bed.<br/>
<br/>

clearly is good for him in some way, otherwise he wouldn&#39;t want it.  <br/>
My son eats WAY more sugar than I would and sometimes watching him  <br/>
makes me a little queasy, but it doesn&#39;t do anything bad to him at  <br/>
all. No cavities, no lack of appetite for healthier foods, no  <br/>
stomachaches. Why would I stop him? That very issue is a good  <br/>
reminder for me about how he and I are two separate people.<br/>

Many moms have developed new interests and learned new things from  <br/>
their children&#39;s interests.  Even if you don&#39;t get interested in  <br/>
playing a certain game, be willing to accept that your child does,  <br/>
already has, and will in the future discover things you didn&#39;t show  <br/>
him.  Be a person with whom he will want to share those things.<br/>

I watched those words dance through my head today as David, Simon, Linnaea and I took Pickle for a walk. Simon rarely ever goes on the dog walks. He prefers to stay at home. Today he went. And I caught myself saying to David, &quot;He has such a good time when he comes, I think he forgets how much fun it is.&quot; And I stopped, and I thought, and I said &quot;Maybe he has such a good time when he comes because he doesn&#39;t have to go when he doesn&#39;t want to.&quot; <br/>

Now she&#39;s into skateboarding. I&#39;m getting my 13yr old stepson to help <br/>
me on this one. We spent the morning at the skatepark. I have decided <br/>
to look for information on the internet about skateboarding - I don&#39;t <br/>
even speak the language! He would say &quot;I&#39;m trying to learn to Ollie <br/>
(sp?)&quot; and I&#39;d say &quot;huh?&quot; I&#39;m learning something new *because* my kids <br/>
are interested. I&#39;m not intending to learn to skateboard (at the <br/>

 activities do you do beside be &#39;in nature&#39;? Being exposed to new<br/>
 stuff is what will generate new interests.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
***If they&#39;re being &quot;exposed&quot; to new stuff just to generate new  <br/>
 interests, though, they could easily decide to resist and avoid the  <br/>
 new stuff, long for video games, and not trust or desire time with mom.***<br/>
<br/>
Yes to the second quote there and,,, playing video games can also generate new interests. <br/>
<br/>
My son loves video games too, all types, and in playing those games I&#39;ve been amazed at the other things he&#39;s learned about and been interested in,  again,  stemming from those video games.  If I would have stepped in and said,  &quot;that&#39;s enough&quot;,, bam, it would have stopped that learning circle right there and his trust in me would have been diminished.  <br/>
<br/>
A few things he&#39;s become interested in from video games:  History, especially world history; Geography (from the research into different battles and wars), Statistics, he&#39;s an amazing statatician, really.  He can look at information and formulate evaluations like I&#39;ve never seen before.  Video games have also led him outside to play.  He&#39;ll run around outside with friends or his sisters acting out scenes from different games.  <br/>
<br/>
He does do other things too, but video games is a huge passion of his.  Its one thing that can keep his mind going.  He loves thinking about things, he loves figuring things out and he likes to keep busy.  Video games do all those things.<br/>
