<div id="ygrps-yiv-170027351">I&#39;m really liking my chat project, and am going to try a new room  <br/>
tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone wants to look at it and maybe create a name and password in  <br/>
advance of a scheduled chat, it&#39;s here.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/room">http://sandradodd.com/room</a><br/>
<br/>
the password is goodidea  (good idea without a space, and if you  <br/>
forget, it&#39;s on the side of the chat logo)<br/>
if they ask for a password.<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow noon (my time, check here for your time:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/chat)">http://sandradodd.com/chat)</a><br/>
is a discussion of how to describe unschooling when people ask.<br/>
<br/>
Thursday afternoon (exact time to be announced) or maybe next Thursday  <br/>
instead, there will be a chat on World of Warcraft, with Kirby Dodd a  <br/>
guest.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wednesday morning before the real chat time I&#39;m going to ask for help  <br/>
testing this room with real people, and I&#39;d like to see how many  <br/>
people it will hold, so about twelve hours from the time of this  <br/>
posting if some of you have a little time and could help me test that  <br/>
room, I&#39;d appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to sleep now, though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-613456762">I&#39;m SO SORRY to have posted bad info and then gone away.<br/>
<br/>
On the art for the chat, on the lower right, it says &quot;good idea!&quot;<br/>
When I saw that I could put a password on the chat to keep wandering  <br/>
chatroom people out, I wanted to use Joy (which is also on the art)  <br/>
but it had to be longer.  So I used what I was looking at.<br/>
<br/>
So leave off the exclamation point and leave out the space, and if you  <br/>
forget the password, it&#39;s on the art in the background when you get to  <br/>
the chat.<br/>
<br/>
This chat format works WAY better than what I&#39;ve  used for the past  <br/>
week.<br/>
<br/>
People can chat anonymously and they can chat with a nickname, without  <br/>
registering.<br/>
If you do register, you can have a photo and identifying country  <br/>
marker and stuff.  I put my birthday but you don&#39;t have to.  And the  <br/>
site was designed by Europeans, so put the month first on your birthday.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I checked my java stuff.  I suspect it&#39;s a TCP port issue.  Many<br/>
corporations block the networking ports commonly used by instant messaging<br/>
apps.  5190 for AIM, 5010 for Yahoo Messenger, etc.  So while this Geesee<br/>
software is running in a web browser (www uses port 80, usually, so 80 would<br/>
never get blocked), I&#39;m suspecting that Geesee is also using an additional<br/>
port...one that&#39;s on the corporation&#39;s &quot;Instant Messenger or other common<br/>
waste of employee&#39;s time&quot; list, so they block it.<br/>
<br/>
More port info here:<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>With Netflix, Sinfest, and youtube, that&#39;s simply a blacklist issue.  As in,<br/>
the corporation bought software such as WebSense that blocks specific sites.<br/>
This can usually be bypassed with VNC software.  You run a VNC server on<br/>
your home PC, and then on the work PC you use a VNC client to connect to<br/>
your home server.  At that point, you&#39;re interacting with your home desktop,<br/>
by remote control, in a window wherever you are.  There are many remote<br/>
control options.  I prefer VNC because it&#39;s free and open source.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tightvnc.com">http://tightvnc.com</a> is my favorite implementation of VNC.   And it wouldn&#39;t<br/>
work for youtube, because all the remote control software is doing is<br/>
sending a &quot;screen shot&quot; of your home desktop periodically, like twice per<br/>
second.  So it can&#39;t/won&#39;t keep up with 25 frames/second video.  -=b.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-248953514">Well if it makes you feel any better I was able to immediately log<br/>
right on no problem.  Of course it wasn&#39;t time for a chat and nobody<br/>
was there (my goof) but I was in the right place even if it was the<br/>
wrong time.  I had a really tough time with the AIM chat which slows<br/>
my computer down so much that just reading was about all I could do to<br/>
participate.  My comments were old news by the time I hit the send<br/>
button ... my puter dragged along that slow.<br/>
