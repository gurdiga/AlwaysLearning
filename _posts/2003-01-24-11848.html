<div id="ygrps-yiv-1566292410">Hi again,<br/>
<br/>
when the kids were younger it was a struggle to have that &quot;leap of faith&quot; - <br/>
since we were in the military community, our style was exceptionally strange. <br/>
 And children learning at home was not a usual way of life - often unheard <br/>
of.  But I knew in my heart that how I felt with them at home vs when they <br/>
were in school (Chris went thro 4th grade, and Shawn K) that it was right.  I <br/>
found kindred spirits in LaLeche League.<br/>
<br/>
When Shawn started community college here (he discovered it was cheaper to <br/>
become a full-time student and have extended health insurance, then buy the <br/>
ins.), he struggled with taking notes, and studying.  BUT, he used to call me <br/>
and tell me the whole class of things like mythology.  He was so jazzed about <br/>
what he was learning.  He even took me to school with him one day to share <br/>
the experience.  <br/>
<br/>
Now he is in PA and on a diving scholarship.  He feels such a sense of <br/>
responsibility to his coach and the school.  He manages good grades even tho <br/>
he works as a bartender, works out tons and has a girlfriend.  He is majoring <br/>
in acting, and gets quite annoyed at the others in group projects that aren&#39;t <br/>
committed and serious about the whole thing.  Most of the students are <br/>
regular college age.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t doubt that I would still think my kids were pretty terrific if they <br/>
had gone to school (like some of my friends&#39; and relatives&#39; kids), but I can <br/>
see an inner committment, drive, and a personal responsibility that I think <br/>
helps them focus on what they want, and gets them there.  Watching them gives <br/>
me a high.  Not to say that there aren&#39;t times when life comes crashing in, <br/>
and I have a heartache for some of the choices they make while they continue <br/>
on their journey.<br/>
<br/>
Shawn said recently, homeschooling is one way, but doesn&#39;t have to be THE <br/>
way!  I sure think it was the BEST way for him, he was so into the peer <br/>
pressure, getting it only out of school hours was plenty :-).  He asked me <br/>
when he was 12 why I didn&#39;t get a job, so I wouldn&#39;t be there ALL the time.  <br/>
HE was why I need to be there all the time at that point.<br/>
<br/>
I could go on endlessly, but for now I simply wish to re-assure those of you <br/>
that are behind me on this path, that your children benefit SO much by the <br/>
choice you have made in keeping them at home.  It shows thro in so many ways <br/>
as they grow up.<br/>
<br/>
bye for now,<br/>
Connie<br/>
<br/>

&gt; they&#39;re <br/>
&gt; still home.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I really liked reading where your kids are at the moment, and that the <br/>
&gt; diver <br/>
&gt; has A&#39;s too.  <br/>
&gt; Not that &quot;A&#39;s&quot; are a goal, but it might be making him feel societally right <br/>
&gt; and good and legit, if he ever did have those doubts.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-710942101">Someone e mailed me and asked how Sam died and how they had a lot of <br/>
fear that something would happen to thier child, but didn&#39;t know how <br/>
to stop worrying.  I decided to post my response here incase anyone <br/>
else had the same issues.<br/>
Sam died 5 years ago, Jan. 19, 2003 when he fell through the ice on a <br/>
pond at our rec. dept.  He was there with friends of ours for their <br/>
daughters indoor lacrosse game.  Their son and Sam went outside and <br/>
onto the pond.  Their son fell through too, but managed to hang on <br/>
til the rescue workers arrived.  Sam was lost instantly.  <br/>
My advice to you, is to let go of your fear.  It will do you <br/>
absolutely no good.  <br/>
It will waste the time you have with your son that could be spent in <br/>
trust and joy.  <br/>
Breath through it when the fear comes.  Let it go.  <br/>
I had fear before Sam died which intensified for my other kids after <br/>
he died, and I have spent a lot of time breathing through it.  I will <br/>
not let my fear affect my kids life.  I will not let it limit their <br/>
possibilities.  I&#39;ve had to watch my kids go off with other people, <br/>
with the memory of Sam leaving our house that day to go play with his <br/>
friend.  As they walked off our porch, Sam, who was really excited <br/>
about playing Animal Crossing with his buddy said to him, &quot;this is <br/>
going to be the best day of our life!&quot;  <br/>
Every time I watch one of my other kids leave with someone other than <br/>
me, I have that memory.  It helps me to really be grateful for the <br/>
time I have and to try to not waste it.  <br/>
My oldest has been to Europe and Florida without us.  She is driving <br/>
now and comes and goes quite a bit with work and school.  She&#39;s <br/>
heading off to college in the fall.  Deep breaths and a knowing that <br/>
I really cant control her destiny keeps me sane.  I try not to let <br/>
the fear take me deeper.<br/>
If I can do it.  You can do it.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m so sorry for your loss of Sam.  It was very helpful to read your <br/>
note; I&#39;d just had my own moment of fear for my kids as I was sitting <br/>
down to the computer.  My moment of fear was uninstigated by anything, <br/>
just one of those moments, and then I saw your note.  I don&#39;t know how <br/>
I would bear it but you&#39;re right:  spending our time worrying <br/>
about &quot;what ifs&quot; only steals from the time we have, and it doesn&#39;t <br/>
lessent the pain any should something horrible happen.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-946218629">Thankyou Joanna,<br/>
We had a bad experience last november when our little 3 year old almost died from chocking.She was fine eating cheese one minute the next my husband was calling me and she was blue and unconsious.I honestly thought she was dead as i was holding her.I was running around screaming and it took what seemed like forever for me to remember that you are meant to hit them on the back....when i did she brought up everything and started breathing again...it was the worst thing i have ever been through.The doctor told us at the hospital that if i hadnt remembered she would have died it was that pat that saved her life.As i read what you wrote i read about the fear you felt for your other kids and i know thats what i have lived too.I didnt lose her but i have been so scared that i might.I think its time for me to let go of the ifs buts and what might have beens and get back to just enjoying life and not let it waste away in fear.Thankyou joanna for sharing your<br/>
 story with us....with me a complete stranger...it might be able to help so many others out there.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m not beating myself up about it (another time waster) but I&#39;m <br/>
wondering how I could have been so vigilant about not letting my <br/>
fears hold my kids back as far as letting them go and do, but I lost <br/>
sight of the fact that my fears were not letting them learn in their <br/>
own way.  I was holding them back in their own home!  When I told <br/>
them we were going to go full on unschooling again, I asked them if <br/>
they were comfortable with that.  Jack, in his oh so wise way <br/>
said, &quot;Mom, I use to be really good at math until you started making <br/>
me do it.&quot;  I told him I thought he was still amazing with the way he <br/>
thinks about numbers and works things out.  He said, &quot;I know&quot;.<br/>
I instantly made the shift once I remembered/woke up.  I&#39;m seeing <br/>
them like I saw Carly and Sam.  I&#39;m feeling really amazed by them.  <br/>
It&#39;s not that I didn&#39;t appreciate them before now.  It&#39;s like a veil <br/>
in my thinking was lifted and I see them without the what if&#39;s, and <br/>
it&#39;s such a better view!<br/>

  Depending on his age, I would go out with him until you feel he is old enough developmentally to stay in the yard.  I am finding that the more freedom I give (even supervised freedom) the less the need to sneak off, wander off, or run off.  If he wants to go around the block, go with him.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Wow. So strange to be reading this today because I had a similar train of<br/>
thought<br/>
yesterday--I was cleaning house and had certain things I wanted done before<br/>
people<br/>
came over. There wasn&#39;t time to do it all, and I had a little conversation<br/>
going in my<br/>
head where someone was being critical (faceless someone, certainly wasn&#39;t<br/>
anyone<br/>
who was coming over) and I was thinking, &quot;Don&#39;t look at what I *haven&#39;t*<br/>
done--<br/>
look at all I *have* done!&quot; I was talking to myself, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
And then it struck me to ponder how often I might&#39;ve done that to my kids--<br/>
looked more at what they hadn&#39;t done than what they had. Or times I&#39;ve done<br/>
it to my husband, or my parents, or anyone. It&#39;s a good thing to be thinking<br/>
about,<br/>
so that I can be thankful, interested, and appreciative, not critical.<br/>

Sometimes people are acting through a fog, like through tinted glass-- <br/>
layers of tinted glass.  Instead of me doing something I that would  <br/>
like to do for Holly, sometimes it kicks back in that I&#39;m saying  <br/>
&#39;what would a good mom do for a kid who is acting ideally?&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Where did those cardboard cut-outs come from?   Y&#39;know, *I* need to  <br/>
do something for Holly.  So it&#39;s just straight between me and Holly.   <br/>
Nothing, y&#39;know--I can touch her, no gloves, no plastic, no window,  <br/>
and people forget that.  They almost feel like they don&#39;t have  <br/>
permission to treat their child like a real one-of-a-kind individual  <br/>
child, and they&#39;re treating them like they think people ought to  <br/>
treat  children--vague, hypothetical children.  So be aware of that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1093421006">Wow. So strange to be reading this today because I had a similar train of<br/>
thought yesterday--I was cleaning house and had certain things I wanted done<br/>
before people came over. There wasn&#39;t time to do it all, and I had a little<br/>
conversation<br/>
going in my head where someone was being critical (faceless someone,<br/>
certainly wasn&#39;t anyone who was coming over) and I was thinking, &quot;Don&#39;t look<br/>
at what I *haven&#39;t* done--look at all I *have* done!&quot; I was talking to<br/>
myself, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
And then it struck me to ponder how often I might&#39;ve done that to my<br/>
kids--looked more at what they hadn&#39;t done than what they had. Or times I&#39;ve<br/>
done it to my husband, or my parents, or anyone. It&#39;s a good thing to be<br/>
thinking about,<br/>
so that I can be thankful, interested, and appreciative, not critical.<br/>
Lissa, mom of 5<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
LOL - I&#39;m feeling like that right now.  The kids&#39; bedrooms are a mess, no<br/>
dinner is made yet.  I need to get ready for work tomorrow and get two of<br/>
the kids ready for school.  It&#39;s already 5:51 pm...and my mind is going and<br/>
going.  Clearly I need to get back to meditating.<br/>

Most six year olds have the capacity to understand &quot;stay in the yard.&quot;  On a practical note, <br/>
you could gradually remove yourself if he&#39;s enjoying some time on his own.  Get to the point <br/>
where you are in the house, but can observe him.  And see where it goes from there.<br/>

I&#39;m thinking that you need to get connected with your internal mommy sense--moms usually <br/>
know what their kids are likely to do.  If you know your child is a &quot;runner&quot;  (&lt;g&gt; I had one <br/>
when he was little), then you respond one way.  If you know your child is likely to stick <br/>
around, you respond another way.  You converse, you ask a few what ifs, and you trust.  If <br/>
you really don&#39;t know, then maybe you have other people&#39;s fears blocking your senses.  Is <br/>
your yard safe?  Whether a child should have time alone outside would be dependent on <br/>
whether the environment is safe, etc.  Only you have the specific answers, but at some point <br/>
you may need to take a deep breath and put more trust into your relationship.<br/>

back yard by himself, but I frequently either go out and check on him <br/>
or look out the windows at him.  He is very creative and can get <br/>

<br/>
I will not let him in the front yard unless I am out with him and <br/>
actively watching or playing with him.  The reason:  Last year the <br/>
city put in a big, deep retention pond that is just 20 feet or so <br/>
from the edge of our front yard.  My son loves water and thinks he is <br/>
absolutely invincible.  He actually thinks he can jump over moving <br/>
cars or could swim across the retention pond.  He is a &quot;runner&quot; as <br/>
well.  Last month when we had a little ice on the retention pond, I <br/>
could barely keep him from running down to it to go &quot;ice skating.&quot;  I <br/>
tried to explain about thin ice, but he thinks he will be okay, that <br/>
it will work.  Needless to say, when we are out in the front yard, I <br/>
do not take my eyes off of him!<br/>

&lt;&lt;As i read what you wrote i read about the fear you felt for your <br/>
other kids and i know thats what i have lived too.I didnt lose her <br/>
but i have been so scared that i might.I think its time for me to let <br/>
go of the ifs buts and what might have beens and get back to just <br/>
enjoying life and not let it waste away in fear.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not beating myself up about it (another time waster) but I&#39;m <br/>
wondering how I could have been so vigilant about not letting my <br/>
fears hold my kids back as far as letting them go and do, but I lost <br/>
sight of the fact that my fears were not letting them learn in their <br/>
own way. I was holding them back in their own home! When I told <br/>
them we were going to go full on unschooling again, I asked them if <br/>
they were comfortable with that. Jack, in his oh so wise way <br/>
said, &quot;Mom, I use to be really good at math until you started making <br/>
me do it.&quot; I told him I thought he was still amazing with the way he <br/>
thinks about numbers and works things out. He said, &quot;I know&quot;.<br/>
I instantly made the shift once I remembered/woke up. I&#39;m seeing <br/>
them like I saw Carly and Sam. I&#39;m feeling really amazed by them. <br/>
It&#39;s not that I didn&#39;t appreciate them before now. It&#39;s like a veil <br/>
in my thinking was lifted and I see them without the what if&#39;s, and <br/>
it&#39;s such a better view!<br/>

demonstrated the &quot;thin ice&quot; in a tangible way, like maybe tossing a small <br/>
rock that would then break the ice. Also if he wants to challenge himself <br/>
with big jumps perhaps he would enjoy building a jumping set up in his back <br/>
yard.<br/>
<br/>
When Jayn wanted to balance on our balcony railing, that was too scary for <br/>
me (2nd storey). We always went downstairs to so she could balance on a <br/>
similar railing that was at ground level. I think she understood that it was <br/>
because *I* was nervous, rather than a lack of faith in *her*.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps he&#39;d enjoy bmx or skateboarding. Those extreme sport folks do some <br/>
pretty amazing things.<br/>
<br/>
Shouldn&#39;t the city fence something like that? I&#39;m not sure what a &quot;retention <br/>
pond&quot; is, but it sounds like a lawsuit waiting to happen.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-423133285">One of the things I always let my kids do was to wonder around on the yard and the farm going wherever they wanted to go. I am lucky I live in a farm but I would have done it in a park too and did many times. I let them just go since they could walk ( wich was 10 and 11 months for my kids-so pretty early) and I would just follow behind as long as we could, exploring everything. I don;t really know if that is why neither is a runner. My sister always ran after her kids, &quot;don&#39;t go there&quot; here or &quot;stay with mom&quot;, &quot;give me your hand&quot;.<br/>
  I am sure personality must play a big role but I can see how it could help if they could have explored more. <br/>

Funny you said that! My sister&#39;s oldest is the big runner, he used to just take off and look back to see if you were chasing him when he got a chance and my sister did use a kid leash on him. One time hw was out in the yard with his dad ( he was really bad with dad around) and he took off the dad slipped in the wet grass and broke his ankle so bad he had to have major surgery.<br/>
  So in my observations tight leashes ( figuratively or actual) make some kids want to run.<br/>

  Or go and  ask him to be the leader on exploring so he can be incharged of where you are going.<br/>
  With both my kids we have let them run a bit in stores ( no causing anyone or anything harm and making sure no costumer was bothered) and we played games of running and hidding. A few times we did that and they just got their fix and were done playing it.<br/>

Have you tried going to a huge park ( and safe) with a friend that CAN run and letting him get his share of runnign around &quot;byhimself&quot; with you two just keeping an eye on him?<br/>
  Or go and  ask him to be the leader on exploring so he can be incharged of where you are going.<br/>
  With both my kids we have let them run a bit in stores ( no causing anyone or anything harm and making sure no costumer was bothered) and we played games of running and hidding. A few times we did that and they just got their fix and were done playing it.<br/>
  Even my dd at 26 months does not run away<br/>
