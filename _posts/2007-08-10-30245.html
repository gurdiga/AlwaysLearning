<div id="ygrps-yiv-776788364">I have a neighbor with two boys, ages 6 and 3, who claims her children <br/>
never fight/argue/squabble. Ever. I&#39;ve seen them at play, and they are <br/>
definitely very nice boys, but they have their moments with the <br/>
neighborhood kids, so I have my doubts about her claim. However, it&#39;s <br/>
not the claim in and of itself that bothers me, it was her statements <br/>
that, &quot;My husband has always told J [the older boy] that it was his job <br/>
to protect M, so he&#39;s never picked on him.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Now, my first response to this (in my head only) was, &quot;Now don&#39;t go <br/>
patting yourself on the back for what you think is good parenting, when <br/>
it probably has more to do with individual personalities than anything <br/>
else.&quot; But, truthfully, I&#39;ve been thinking about her statement ever <br/>
since, and have been trying to really sort out whether or not I think <br/>
it&#39;s a good idea for her to give this &quot;job&quot; to her older son (not that <br/>
I can do anything about it, but I think about it nonetheless). In my <br/>
gut it doesn&#39;t sit right, but then I think maybe if he feels like <br/>
the &quot;almighty protector&quot; it could change his view of his sibling, and <br/>
reduce the rivalry.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, I keep going round and round about this to myself, and I <br/>
can&#39;t seem to really pull my thoughts together on it, so I thought I&#39;d <br/>
offer it up to the group to get your responses.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1142919537">-=I have a neighbor with two boys, ages 6 and 3, who claims her children<br/>

neighborhood kids, so I have my doubts about her claim-=-<br/>
<br/>
I know a family with five kids and the kids didn&#39;t argue or  <br/>
squabble.  It was interesting.  They&#39;re grown now and all still very  <br/>
friendly with each other.  Their mom is very amiable with everyone,  <br/>
too.  Even when she gets cranky, she doesn&#39;t get angry or yell,  <br/>
ever.  I&#39;ve known her for over 20 years.<br/>
<br/>
The dad was an insane old hippie I could hardly stand and he was just  <br/>
the opposite.  Maybe the kids lucked out and got their mom&#39;s  <br/>
disposition, and had their dad as a beacon of how not to be.<br/>
<br/>
They didn&#39;t fight with other kids, either; mine hung out with them  <br/>
quite a bit.<br/>
<br/>
They didn&#39;t go to school.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Now, my first response to this (in my head only) was, &quot;Now don&#39;t go<br/>
patting yourself on the back for what you think is good parenting, when<br/>
it probably has more to do with individual personalities than anything<br/>
else.&quot; -=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s probably some and some.<br/>
<br/>
Another family we know had &quot;an easy baby&quot; (girl) while I had Kirby,  <br/>
who was a busy, noisy, curious, active kid.<br/>
Then they had a LOUD, sneaky, bully of a little girl about the time I  <br/>
had Marty, who was Mr. Cool and Calm.<br/>
<br/>
The mom (who was over here last week; we&#39;re still friends) told me  <br/>
then, when our #2 kids were about a year old, that she and her  <br/>
husband used to talk about what bad parents Keith and I were to have  <br/>
a kid like Kirby, but now that she had seen round two, she knew they  <br/>
had just totally lucked out with their first girl.<br/>
<br/>
-=-have been trying to really sort out whether or not I think<br/>
it&#39;s a good idea for her to give this &quot;job&quot; to her older son-=-<br/>
<br/>
My mom used to tell me to take care of my sister, and once she got  <br/>
hurt through no fault of mine.  I was five and she was two.  I felt  <br/>
like it was my fault for a long time, but thinking back later I was  <br/>
angry with my mom for putting me in that position.  My sister fell  <br/>
and cut the inside of the roof of her mouth on the edge of a big  <br/>
metal wash tub.  She had been standing backwards in a stroller,  <br/>
bouncing up and down.  I didn&#39;t know that was really dangerous.  My  <br/>
mom was in the house.  We were playing ocean, with a tub of water.     <br/>
The stroller fell and she hit her mouth and there was blood to her  <br/>
feet and my mom called a cab and my sister had stitches inside her  <br/>
mouth and was in the hospital like four days.  I was left with an  <br/>
aunt and uncle who had not a single toy, who didn&#39;t know what to do  <br/>
with me, but they had an upstairs apartment with a porch swing where  <br/>
I would sit and think I might have killed my sister.<br/>
<br/>
Still, terrible stories aside, if parents can encourage kids to watch  <br/>
out for each other&#39;s safety, that&#39;s not awful.  But watching out for  <br/>
ANYone&#39;s safety makes even more sense to me.  My kids remind me when  <br/>
I&#39;m doing something that might not be safe.  They make  <br/>
recommendations of a safer place to put the ladder or whatever, if  <br/>
they notice.<br/>
<br/>
-=-At any rate, I keep going round and round about this to myself, and I<br/>
can&#39;t seem to really pull my thoughts together on it, so I thought I&#39;d<br/>
offer it up to the group to get your responses.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think &quot;He needs to feel safe at home&quot; works at home, and individual  <br/>
little &quot;keep an eye on him&quot; or &quot;try to remember to get him to eat and  <br/>
drink something&quot; as they go out together outside the house might  <br/>
help.  After a while they&#39;ll think those things on their own.<br/>
<br/>
Just recently Marty and a friend took Holly and her friend to a  <br/>
concert in another city.  Holly was sick, and I asked the other three  <br/>
to be patient with her and kinda treat her like a baby.  They  <br/>
understood (the older ones did, anyway).  And by midday she was  <br/>
feeling much better anyway.<br/>

&gt; never fight/argue/squabble.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>While saying &quot;never&quot; seems like an exaggeration to me, I too have children<br/>
who hardly every fight/argue/squabble with each other.  I think it is in<br/>
part their personalities, but mostly I think it is because I made it a VERY<br/>
high priority to stay close by and help them to sort out their differences<br/>
from the time they were small.  (they are 12 and 10 now)<br/>
<br/>
When they were frustrated and couldn&#39;t articulate their feelings to each<br/>
other, I helped them to sort it out and communicate it to each other in a<br/>
non-blaming way and we usually found a win/win solution.  Now it is rare<br/>
that they cannot work something out on their own.  My youngest has been<br/>
dealing with an elevated anxiety level for the last several months which<br/>
seems to run in the family and one of the ways she deals with it is to talk<br/>
a LOT. (which makes it harder for her to listen)  That has added a new level<br/>
of frustration to our home and yet MOST of the time they still deal very<br/>
kindly with each other.  <br/>
<br/>
There have been a couple days this week where for a part of the day they<br/>
have been frustrated with each other and have had more difficulty than<br/>
typical. Sometimes it actually throws me for a loop because I so rarely have<br/>
to deal with discord between them.  One of the days when they got frustrated<br/>
with each other, they were playing nicely together later and really having<br/>
fun, and I made a point to ask them if life is better because they have a<br/>
sibling most of the time and if they thought our home would be a lot less<br/>
interesting and fun if they did not have each other.  They agreed and even<br/>
agreed that they loved each other and would not want to be without each<br/>
other.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard at times but it&#39;s been so worth it to invest the time I have in<br/>
their relationships with each other.  And while I do ask them to look out<br/>
for each other, I would never make them be responsible for each other.  That<br/>
is my job.<br/>

been thinking about that a lot and trying to see the win/win solution<br/>
in our daily lives. It&#39;s been difficult when the kids are squabbling.<br/>
What to do, for instance, when they both want to use the computer /<br/>
sit in the a particular chair / play with a toy at the same time and<br/>
no, they don&#39;t want to share at that moment and aren&#39;t interested in<br/>
finding an alternative activity/chair/toy. Maybe it&#39;s a (frequent)<br/>
coincidence of having the same desire/need at the exact same time, but<br/>
sometimes it appears that like they want and item /choose to do a<br/>
thing because the other showed interest.<br/>
<br/>
It seems there are times when it ends up with someone upset no matter<br/>
how I try to approach it or what suggestions/empathy I offer. It feels<br/>
like someone &quot;wins&quot; and the other doesn&#39;t. Even if they agree to take<br/>
turns it comes down to who gets to go first... and then that&#39;s another<br/>
squabble... argh. What most parents I know say when this situation<br/>
happens is &quot;if you can&#39;t stop arguing about it then NO ONE gets to do<br/>
it&quot; and/or &quot;stop fighting over it or I&#39;ll take it away from both of<br/>
you&quot;. Of course, that is *not* what I want to say, but my brain seems<br/>
to falter after discarding that bit of parenting unwisdom and fails to<br/>
find a good alternative approach... ideas about what tools you use to<br/>
handle sibling rivalry would be much appreciated.<br/>

two ;)<br/>
It&#39;s amazing to hear such wisdom come out of their mouths, not as<br/>
regurgitation, as real knowledge of what works and what feels good and what<br/>
is win/win/win.<br/>
My favorite example is when Marty witnessed my struggles with Hayden&#39;s<br/>
angst. We went out of earshot and he shifted my perspective by sharing his<br/>
own stories and perspective: This is probably how it feels... This is what<br/>
might work... and supportive talk of &quot;you already know, I&#39;m just reminding<br/>
you.&quot; I still use his &quot;You are the alpha AND the omega&quot; comment as an<br/>
internal mantra. He meant is as if I have the solutions to the problems,<br/>
even (maybe especially) the ones I feel are caused by my own<br/>
thoughts/behaviors.<br/>
I know that this comes from a non-ageist perspective -- he doesn&#39;t feel he<br/>
has to talk to be a certain way because &quot;I&#39;m the adult&quot; it&#39;s really person<br/>
to person communication, because that&#39;s how he&#39;s been treated his whole<br/>
life.<br/>
Not examples of perfection by any means, true examples of real human beings<br/>
who are open and honest and free to be themselves -- those Dodd kids!! Yeah,<br/>
it&#39;s what I hold in my heart as a reminder of why I&#39;ve made a conscious<br/>
choice to live this way.<br/>

remember my mom getting angry or yelling, but was that because we <br/>
didn&#39;t argue or did we not argue because she didn&#39;t yell? :)  I have <br/>
no idea, but I struggle a lot in dealing with arguments between my <br/>
daughters.  To tell you the truth, I just don&#39;t understand why they <br/>
pick on each other when they are bored.  I don&#39;t know if I ever will <br/>
understand it.  They are so unlike me in personality.  My older dd, <br/>
who&#39;s 12 now, is so quickly angered by so many things, minor <br/>
annoyances to me, that she goes straight to yelling at her little <br/>
sister.  They are both so much more restless than me as well.  As a <br/>
kid, I just don&#39;t remember being bored.  I was always happy to color <br/>
or read or just mess about in the yard. <br/>
<br/>
I get angry so much easier now as a parent than I ever used to.  I <br/>
have such a hard time when my girls won&#39;t just stop something that&#39;s <br/>
bothering someone else.  I never thought that being a mom would be <br/>
like this, I guess because my mom made it seem so easy.  I don&#39;t <br/>
remember her ever having to ask us to be nicer.  It&#39;s really sad to me <br/>
that my girls aren&#39;t nicer, and that&#39;s hard to admit.<br/>

Maybe if you say it just like that to each of them, separately, and  <br/>
ask what they think you could do to help, they&#39;ll have good ideas.   <br/>
Or maybe they&#39;ll think more carefully before being reactionary or  <br/>
antagonistic because they will want to make you more comfortable.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How old are your children?  I have two daughters who are now 10 and 12.<br/>
When they were little we pretty much bought 2 of everything, even the same<br/>
clothes.  It was easier that way because they shared most of the same<br/>
interests.  <br/>
<br/>
WRT computers, well, we have four of them (in one room and more in the<br/>
basement, but I&#39;m married to a techie) and right now we are all in the same<br/>
room talking to each other and playing on our own pcs.  Let&#39;s see, dd&#39;s are<br/>
both playing on on-line role playing type of game where they are interacting<br/>
with each other on-line as well as in person.  Dh is doing something for<br/>
work. (and fixing the two printers in between that I seem to have broke this<br/>
week while he was out of town) I&#39;m checking email and listening a lot.  <br/>
<br/>
One thing I did if we had 1 particular game that was the coveted game(Often<br/>
we could play them on two pc&#39;s at once because they are connected and<br/>
sometimes we copied them for our own use) was to spend some 1 on 1 time with<br/>
the child who had to wait.  My girls love to spend time with me like that.<br/>
We often play board games or read together or even just watch tv together.<br/>
But also, they do enjoy sitting with each other, watching each other play a<br/>
new game, even if they wish they were the one playing.  <br/>
<br/>
But the thing I think that has always made the biggest difference is that<br/>
they both know that their wants and needs are important to me and if I can,<br/>
I will find a way to make whatever they want happen.  It&#39;s always been that<br/>
way.  If I take the time to think creatively, I can usually make it happen.<br/>

&lt;&lt;My mom used to tell me to take care of my sister, and once she got <br/>
hurt through no fault of mine. I was five and she was two. I felt <br/>
like it was my fault for a long time, but thinking back later I was <br/>
angry with my mom for putting me in that position. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes. This was my trouble with this approach. It seemed like too much, <br/>
and inappropriate, responsibility for a child. My husband, the oldest <br/>
of four boys, used to get into trouble if any of the boys did <br/>
something wrong becuase &quot;he should have known better than to let them <br/>
do it.&quot; I&#39;ve always thought that was extremely unfair, and I guess <br/>
the whole &quot;take care of your younger sibling&quot; thing just smacked of <br/>
that to me. I do agree, however, with what more than one of you said <br/>
about the principle of watching out for the care and safety of <br/>
siblings/others. This seems a lot more reasonable than making one <br/>
person the &quot;protector&quot; and one (or more) person(s) the &quot;protected.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Angela said:<br/>
&lt;&lt;I think it is in part their personalities, but mostly I think it is <br/>
because I made it a VERY high priority to stay close by and help them <br/>
to sort out their differences from the time they were small. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
See, I just don&#39;t agree with this. I mean I agree with staying close <br/>
by and helping kids sort out differences....I have done the exact <br/>
same thing, and have been utterly consistent, yet my children <br/>
sometimes fight. I mean they can go from &quot;Would you help me, please?&quot; <br/>
to each other, to (the younger one usually) screaming and smacking <br/>
the older one within minutes. Granted, it&#39;s usually when they&#39;re <br/>
tired, but not always. More often than not, it&#39;s when I have to walk <br/>
out of the room to do something. They rarely, if ever (I really can&#39;t <br/>
recall a time), will do this if I am playing with them. And, if I can <br/>
stop what I&#39;m doing, I do take one of them away from the situation <br/>
and find something to do with them that they enjoy, which works to <br/>
resolve that particular situation, but I don&#39;t know that it helps <br/>
them to adopt the principle of kindness.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also seen families who certainly wouldn&#39;t win any parenting <br/>
awards in this group with children who behave very nicely with each <br/>
other. So, I just can&#39;t attribute (at least not &quot;mostly&quot;) a lack of <br/>
sibling rivaly to &quot;good parenting.&quot; I think there are many, heavier-<br/>
weighing, factors. <br/>
<br/>
For example, my youngest two kids are both adopted. My youngest lived <br/>
in an orphanage before living with us. Even though she didn&#39;t live <br/>
there all that long, as you all probably know, babies&#39; brains <br/>
get &quot;wired&quot; into certain patterns right from the beginning. More <br/>
specifically, when their basic needs are not being met, and they <br/>
haven&#39;t bonded with their birth mother, that sets off certain <br/>
responses in their brain that affects their overall development and <br/>
personality. I think this has A LOT to do with how my kids respond to <br/>
each other. This is something I can work on with good parenting <br/>
skills, but I don&#39;t think they respond to each other due to any kind <br/>
of lack of good parenting skills. I guess this is what offended me <br/>
about my neighbor&#39;s comment. It was as if she was saying to me, &quot;Your <br/>
kids wouldn&#39;t fight, too, if you were a better parent.&quot; Of course I <br/>
know she wasn&#39;t saying this, but like Sandra&#39;s friends with the same-<br/>

<br/>
Ok, now I&#39;m just whining. I know that the why doesn&#39;t really matter <br/>
one whit. I did, however, clarify my thoughts (thanks, everyone, for <br/>
your help with this), and I will, now, encourage my children to watch <br/>
out for the care and safety of each other instead of just keeping <br/>
that to myself. This, along with the discussion of principles vs. <br/>
rules, brought about some really good suggestions that I have <br/>
incorporated into my approach with the rivalry. Maybe it&#39;ll help.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-413480696"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Angela said:<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;I think it is in part their personalities, but mostly I think it is<br/>
&gt; because I made it a VERY high priority to stay close by and help them<br/>
&gt; to sort out their differences from the time they were small. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; See, I just don&#39;t agree with this. I mean I agree with staying close<br/>
&gt; by and helping kids sort out differences....I have done the exact<br/>
&gt; same thing, and have been utterly consistent, yet my children<br/>
&gt; sometimes fight<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
&gt; For example, my youngest two kids are both adopted. My youngest lived<br/>
&gt; in an orphanage before living with us. Even though she didn&#39;t live<br/>
&gt; there all that long, as you all probably know, babies&#39; brains<br/>
&gt; get &quot;wired&quot; into certain patterns right from the beginning<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s hard to say precisely how much is nature vs. nurture.  But even as<br/>
babies my children learned to trust that I would try to meet their needs.<br/>
They spent their infancies at the breast and in arms.  It becomes a part of<br/>
who they are.  Would my children be different if they spent time in an<br/>
orphanage as babies?  I think so.  Absolutely.  <br/>
<br/>
I do know that my children came wired with their own personalities right<br/>
from the start.  They both have always been very verbal and articulate.<br/>
They are both very sensitive people.  When they were small a few people<br/>
suggested to me that I made them as sensitive as they are by coddling them.<br/>
But the thing is, I coddled (held, nursed, cuddled) them because they seemed<br/>
so sensitive and seemed to need to be close a lot.  (they cried when I put<br/>
them down, so I held them all the time)<br/>
<br/>
But they learned to negotiate with each other because I stayed close right<br/>
from the start, most often playing with them, and I interceded BEFORE a<br/>
crisis developed. (we have a pretty small house and they hardly ever played<br/>
out of ear shot.) I did not look at their relationship with each other and<br/>
think, well, siblings fight, it&#39;s just what they do, like some people I know<br/>
do.  I do not think that is helpful.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe it is partially how one looks at things too.  I tend to see all the<br/>
good things and not focus on the bad.  When my kids do argue, we talk and<br/>
solve it and it passes and life becomes peaceful again quickly.  I have<br/>
always tended to see the cup as half full rather than half empty.  I am<br/>
forever the optimist.  <br/>
<br/>
You may not be able to stop all conflicts with your children but if you stay<br/>
close and help them to work through them before they become a crisis, as<br/>
well as search for ways to lessen conflicts (buy another computer maybe)<br/>
then they will continue to get better at conflict resolution.  I still don&#39;t<br/>
how old they are but it got easier as they got older. At times when mine<br/>
were young and my friends from play groups were all hanging out with each<br/>
other as the kids played (and sometimes fought), I always stayed close to<br/>
mine and sometimes felt left out while I helped them to negotiate with each<br/>
other and all the other kids.  I do not know any other siblings who get<br/>
along as well as mine do.  In fact, many of the siblings I know are just<br/>
hateful to each other and the parents say nothing to them when they say<br/>
hateful things to each other.<br/>
<br/>
I also want to point out the difference in being close by physically without<br/>
being close by mentally.  (not sure how to word that.)  You can be somewhere<br/>
physically but still not really be present with your children.  Not saying<br/>
that is what you do but I do know people who can be in the room with their<br/>
kids and still not see a conflict coming because they are somewhere else in<br/>
their minds.  I can see the crisis coming with their children long before<br/>
they do.  Maybe that is because their interpersonal skills are not as<br/>
strong.  Lots of factors to consider but worth the effort to help where you<br/>
can.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; by and helping kids sort out differences....I have done the exact <br/>
&gt; same thing, and have been utterly consistent, yet my children <br/>
&gt; sometimes fight. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree that there are some personality types or situations that <br/>
result in children that might be more likely to fight or hit as a <br/>
first course of action, even though the parent is present and <br/>
exhibiting way more caring than the average.<br/>
<br/>
I think that it shows that they are still lacking the self awareness <br/>
or communication skills to pause and think through the options for <br/>
their response, and so there is still a great modeling and learning <br/>
opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
In our family, my two daughters 8 and 6, get along incredibly well, <br/>
at this age.  A few years ago, they could play for a while and then <br/>
inevitably some irritation would come up and they might have a fight, <br/>
because they needed a break (and usually some food, rest, etc.)  Now <br/>
they can play for extended times, and it is days between times when <br/>
there is a fight or irritation.  <br/>
<br/>
Now they have a younger brother who is 3, and my middle daughter has <br/>
big issues with him, is frequently irritated by him, is frequently <br/>
unwilling to share anything of hers (dvd&#39;s, toy pieces, etc.) with <br/>
him, and will hit him so quickly in the event of a transgression that <br/>
even if I am feet away, sometimes it happens in a moment and I cannot <br/>
get there quickly to get between them.<br/>
<br/>
I have been working really hard on thinking through what I have done <br/>
and can do to create a better environment for all of them that will <br/>
allow them to be safe and learn how to communicate.  A few things <br/>
that have helped me are:<br/>
<br/>
I thought that I was being fair to everyone, but after scrutinizing <br/>
my reactions, I have always been a lot more defensive of the &quot;hittee&quot; <br/>
whether it was my younger daughter a few years ago, or my son now.  I <br/>
have really been trying hard to debrief as much with the hitter as <br/>
with the hittee, and to avoid blowing up in a mama bear sort of way <br/>
at all costs.<br/>
<br/>
I read somewhere on another list a post by Ren Allen (another <br/>
seasoned unschooler), that she will give the hitter a hug.  This is <br/>
actually brilliant.  My interpretation is that she is demonstrating <br/>
trust that the hitter is really a good person, even though they just <br/>
hit someone.  She also acknowledges that they are somewhere on the <br/>
path to learning better communication skills, and need empathy and <br/>
communication more than anything else to support the learning.<br/>
<br/>
The only difficulty I have with implementing this strategy is that my <br/>
son takes a long time to calm down, so when I go to him first, often <br/>
by the time he is calm enough to be left on his own for a few minutes <br/>
to go to my daughter, she is often totally over the episode, and <br/>
might be busy playing with her sister.  So she may not be as <br/>
interested in the hug and discussion.  Usually when it plays out like <br/>
that I just tell her I wanted to &quot;check and make sure she is okay, <br/>
because she had to be really upset about something to hit her <br/>
brother.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The other thing that I have learned, is to try and see the joyous <br/>
times in their relationships, of which there are lots, and growing <br/>
over time.  I will work on mine and my husband&#39;s reactions to <br/>
fighting and try to bolster our awareness of the opportunity to model <br/>
better communicating.  I am trying to look at all other areas of <br/>
their lives to make sure that the cup is fuller than it might be <br/>
right now.  Putting those &quot;aware&quot; thoughts out into the forefront of <br/>
my consciousness helps me to make better decisions each and every <br/>
time.  <br/>
<br/>
The one last thought, which is really a question is this.  When I <br/>
have thought through what to say to my children when there is <br/>
hitting, I have tried to think about the answer to &quot;why&quot; they <br/>
shouldn&#39;t hit.  I know that Sandra has used the jail/physical harm <br/>
logic, but I&#39;ve felt like that one sounds too harsh for my kids.  Any <br/>
other logic for not hitting I&#39;ve come up with ultimately becomes a <br/>
self-serving reason (like, if you hit your brother, he will be upset <br/>
and then we will not be able to go to Target as quickly, because I&#39;ll <br/>
have to spend time with him to calm him down); not only that, it <br/>
again seems to refocus on the fact that her brother is doing <br/>
something to irritate her.  So for now I&#39;ve dropped trying to share a <br/>
reason why they shouldn&#39;t hit, I am just responding in the <br/>
circumstance and trying to use the gentleness and fairness described <br/>
above.<br/>
<br/>
Now that I think about it though, I know that my oldest has expressed <br/>
a viewpoint that she feels like war is a bad thing, and maybe it&#39;s <br/>
possible to say something like &quot;war might be what happens when people <br/>
grow up and can&#39;t talk about their problems and feel like they need <br/>
to hit each other.&quot;  Thoughts on that???  Still not sure of the logic.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts appreciated.<br/>

I agree.  There&#39;s a set of those assumptions, like &quot;terrible  <br/>
twos&quot; (Marty was like an angel the whole time he was two years old,  <br/>

<br/>
Instead of belitting our children and assuming they are limited and  <br/>
treating them as limited beings, we can consciously treat them as  <br/>
people, whole people, people who want to do as well as they can.  And  <br/>
we can help them do well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1664377790">Jackie, this is brilliant to me also.  So far we have given our <br/>
children freedom to decide what they want to do with their time.  <br/>
Your suggestion allows them to actively participate in designing how <br/>
they want to be as people.  <br/>
<br/>
How often do individuals attain that emotional self-awareness that <br/>
hey can make a choice about how they want to be?  I wish I would have <br/>
learned more a lot earlier in my life.  I know that my husband and I <br/>
are always talking about what kind of people we want to be, when it <br/>
comes to relationships with others, as well as what we want to do <br/>
with our lives.  A lot of times I think these conversations tend to <br/>
happen at night when the kids are asleep, though.  There is no reason <br/>
that we cannot more proactively have conversations with our children <br/>
included about how we want to treat each other and others.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your insights.  I also have read some of your comments in <br/>
the past about your domestic life with your children when they were <br/>
young (mostly how you managed food, mess, etc.), and the posts <br/>

while generally a patient and kind person, will get fed up with her <br/>

little sister.<br/>
<br/>
Margaux hits and kicks and screams when she is frustrated or upset <br/>
about things.  She&#39;s getting better, but it&#39;s a very long slow <br/>
process for her. <br/>
<br/>
Chamille doesn&#39;t tolerate that from her sister, and mostly I let her <br/>
handle it her own way.  She is getting better at it too.  She has a <br/>
clear level of tolerance, and Marguax knows when she&#39;s stepped over <br/>
that threshold and does it anyway, testing her in a way.<br/>
<br/>
Last night Chamille rearranged her whole room.  She wanted a cozy <br/>
computer place to hang out in her room.  She invited her sister to <br/>
come and join her in her new space.  It was really sweet, and I <br/>
wasn&#39;t invited, which was kinda cool too.  It made Margaux feel very <br/>
special.  It was fun and there was a lot of laughter and joy in that <br/>
room that I wasn&#39;t allowed into.<br/>
<br/>
It lasted about 40 min, until Margaux started getting too loud and <br/>
wild in there, hitting Chamille over and over with a stuffed animal <br/>
with hard eyes, and after being asked and told repeatedly to stop, <br/>
Chamille got fed up, gave her a pinch on the arm, and told her to <br/>
leave.  Margaux cried about it, but the message was clear and I was <br/>
proud of Chamille for not accepting her sister&#39;s abuse.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s how life works, you just don&#39;t hit someone repeatedly and have <br/>
them ask you to stop and not do so, without some sort of <br/>
repricussion.  I&#39;ve always told my girls that if they are going to <br/>
hit, then they should expect to get hit back, even if I tell them not <br/>
to hit each other.  I told Chamille that she shouldn&#39;t have pinched <br/>
her sister.  Chamille&#39;s response was that she wasn&#39;t stopping and she <br/>
knew that if she gave her sister a pinch, which she deserved, then <br/>
she would leave, because asking her and telling her wasn&#39;t working.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s interesting for me to accept this.  While in general I think <br/>
retaliating is wrong, hitting back is wrong, and I don&#39;t condone such <br/>
things, I feel that Chamille handled the situation quite fairly and <br/>
without anger, which is a huge big deal!  She could&#39;ve asked me to <br/>
come get Margaux, but she wanted to handle it on her own which was <br/>
cool.  Then, when Margaux came crying to me, she was crying more <br/>
about being kicked out, than about being pinched, although that was <br/>
her stated reason for crying.  Since Margaux is the &quot;hitter&quot; around <br/>
here, she knew clearly what she&#39;d done wrong and why she&#39;d been <br/>
kicked out.<br/>
<br/>
Just for those that don&#39;t know, Chamille is 13 and Margaux is 5, <br/>
almost 6, very different developmental ages and stages right now!</div>
