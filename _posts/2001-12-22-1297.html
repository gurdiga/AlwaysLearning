<div id="ygrps-yiv-1409439827">Thanks Kathryn.  I&#39;ve heard of the occurrances at (of)<br/>
Fatima.  To me, it seems that prayer is the focusing<br/>
of INTENT. The more intent is infused with passion the<br/>
better the results.  Children with the their unspoiled<br/>
abilities are better able to see the manifestations<br/>
that are brought about. Healings seem to work better<br/>
with children.<br/>
<br/>
It seems, to me, that it doesn&#39;t really matter what is<br/>
used as a focus or conduit what matters is Heart or<br/>
true feelings or the intent of the participants. <br/>
There is a connection between everything in the<br/>
universe.  Or universes. (?) This connection or energy<br/>
or Tao or God or or whatever you want to call it can<br/>
be tapped into through prayer, or meditation, or<br/>
personal power, or dreams, or whatever you want to<br/>
call it, and wonderfull (or  terrible) things can<br/>
happen. Whatever your belief system allows is the way<br/>
you will percieve your surroundings and yourself.  The<br/>
more your belief systems incorporates other belief<br/>
systems, the more you can percieve.<br/>
<br/>
All paths lead to one (some have to travel a twisty<br/>
turny path, though. Me for example.).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1187529224">Thanks Kathryn...enjoyed reading this story of your connection with your<br/>
grandma and the power of being at Fatima.  I&#39;ve heard of it,  but never<br/>
really explored it.<br/>
<br/>
As to the hail mary...I stand corrected that it IS a prayer.  (though &quot;hail&quot;<br/>
is still a greeting...It&#39;s how Luke describes Gabriel greeting Mary to ask<br/>
her about conceiving Jesus.)  Anyway,  been busy today and will respond to<br/>
the prayer issue more fully tomorrow IF this darlingtoddler will sleep a few<br/>
hours for me....he&#39;s crying now....so gotta go!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-96677127"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Children with the their unspoiled abilities are better able to see the <br/>
&gt;&gt;manifestations that are brought about.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This reminds me of a thought that has creeped into my consciouness many <br/>
times since my kids were babies. It&#39;s not really a belief system or anything <br/>
concrete, more of just a feeling that comes over me from time to time. When <br/>
I look at a baby, especially when I&#39;m not interacting with them, I sense <br/>
that they are more &quot;knowing&quot; than we are. They seem to perceive things that <br/>
we, as adults, have lost. Like when a baby startles or laughs at nothing in <br/>
particular. It could be a physical reponse, a genetic instict, an immature <br/>
nervous system. Or maybe it could be that they can still &quot;see&quot; things that <br/>
we have lost the ability to see.<br/>
<br/>
When Casey was 2, we once had an interesting conversation. She was pretty <br/>
verbal early on, so you could actually have conversations with her at 2. <br/>
Anyway, we were driving in the car once and she started telling me about <br/>
what life was like when she was &quot;a little girl&quot;. She told me that when she <br/>
was a little girl everything was white (a snowy place?), and there were no <br/>
trees around. She described the setting a little more and then told me about <br/>
her mother (!).<br/>
<br/>
She told me her mother died when she was a little girl and she was very sad <br/>
about it. It has always made me wonder if she had a fabulously developed <br/>
imagination, or if whe was recalling a past life, or (I hope not) seeing <br/>
into the future (we now live where there aren&#39;t many trees and it&#39;s white <br/>
for 6 months out of the year.) No matter what, it was an odd conversation to <br/>
have with a 2 year old. She doesn&#39;t remember any of it now. She&#39;s 7.<br/>

<br/>
I used to LOVE to read those stories, and I think you should maybe pursue it.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a book (probably out of print) called The Girl with the Blue Eyes I <br/>
think, about a woman somewhere in the U.S. (north east) wo was remembering a <br/>
life in Canada, and she remembered so many details they went and found the <br/>
ruins of the house, just as she had described it.<br/>
<br/>
And a kid in India remembering a recent life went to that nearby town and <br/>
could name all the places and people, even though she was little.  And they <br/>
were there.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;No matter what, it was an odd conversation to <br/>
have with a 2 year old. She doesn&#39;t remember any of it now. She&#39;s 7.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If she gets interested in past life regression it would be interesting to see <br/>
if more of it comes out.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who&#39;s BIG into that--she&#39;s a professional psychic, and she <br/>
cares SO much I can&#39;t keep a straight face.  It usually seems bogus and <br/>
worthless to me, and bad things to remember (we have enough grief and angst <br/>
from a single life without the burden of others) but then I hear stories like <br/>
this about Casey and a shiver goes down me and I remember how exciting those <br/>
stories are.<br/>
<br/>
Damn me and my monkey curiosity to hell.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; what life was like when she was &quot;a little girl&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oooo... my Cacie (short for Acacia), when she was 2 and 3, used to talk<br/>
about &quot;when I was the mommy and you were the little girl&quot; on a sort of<br/>
irregular basis, maybe a half-dozen times total. She always talked about<br/>
it like I would know exactly what she meant, like she would talk about<br/>
the park we went to last week or something. Onec she talked about there<br/>
being a fire, and also about her dad being &quot;the baby&quot; (this is when he<br/>
was in prison, so she didn&#39;t see him very often) and her grandpa (my dad,<br/>
whom she also didn&#39;t see very often) being &quot;the dad&quot;. The dad and the<br/>
baby died in the fire... I didn&#39;t quite know what to make of it either,<br/>
and she doesn&#39;t remember it now (she&#39;s almost 9). I remember posting it<br/>
to misc.kids at the time, and getting some really odd feedback :-O<br/>
<br/>
About a half hour after my mom died on the morning of the11th, Cacie<br/>
apparently &quot;saw&quot; her sitting on the couch with the rest of us - we were<br/>
all together, her, me, my dad, my sister (who we called on her cell phone<br/>
to tell her and she said &quot;I&#39;m right here in front of your house, I just<br/>
came over&quot;), and my brother, just talking and crying, and Cacie saw her<br/>
grandma sitting right where she always sat on the corner of the couch.<br/>
She didn&#39;t mention it at the time, but the next day or the day after, she<br/>
turned to me in the car and said something like, &quot;Mom, I think I&#39;m having<br/>
some hallucinations.&quot; and then described it. I told her that that was<br/>
really a good kind of hallucination to have, since she said it made her<br/>
feel better.... that sometimes people who have died recently stop by to<br/>
visit.  I think she was worried that she was becoming mentally ill. We<br/>
told my sister about it and she said it made her feel much better ..<br/>
<br/>
I still don&#39;t know if I believe that this stuff comes from something<br/>
external, or something internal... I&#39;m not sure it matters, really.<br/>
Although if she ever wants to do a past-life regression I think it would<br/>
be interesting. I&#39;m sure she&#39;s quite high on the scale of natural<br/>
dissociative abilities - at 3 and 4, she used to while away long car<br/>
trips by watching movies with her eyes closed, she could just shut her<br/>
eyes and replay them. Now she reads, I wonder if she&#39;s lost the skill..<br/>

the next time he brought my other brother who had died two years earlier. <br/>
I&#39;ve had many strange dreams in my life, but this one was different. It felt <br/>
real and glowing and peaceful. I just knew that all was well.<br/>
