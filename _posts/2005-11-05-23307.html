 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t have a child who plays games, but I do have a husband who does<br/>
(he&#39;s actually a game programmer.) What I can tell you is that those<br/>
games take a certain amount of time to finish. He&#39;s working hard to<br/>
achieve something. When he has achieved his goals, your son will<br/>
likely take a cooling off period before diving into the next game, or<br/>
not. HTH<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-877619792">Hi Melanie,<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to share that my 11 yo son has been on X-box live since July<br/>
every day that we have been home (all but two or three days). He usually<br/>
gets up in the morning and goes right to it...before eating or drinking or<br/>
anything. If I don&#39;t bring him food, it will sometimes be four hours or more<br/>
before he stops to get something to eat.<br/>
<br/>
Things I am currently doing:<br/>
-sitting with him while he plays...it&#39;s VERY exciting stuff! He&#39;s connected<br/>
to kids all over the world and I particularly love the conversations they<br/>
have about what time it is where they are, and sometimes what DAY it is<br/>
where they are. I&#39;ve listened to my guy &quot;defend&quot; himself because he has a<br/>
speech impediment...so eloquently...moreso than I think he would be able to<br/>
face-to-face (seems like really good practice actually). There really is<br/>
just so much to love about Xbox live.<br/>
<br/>
-noticing what he needs (food, drink, fan on, etc.) while he&#39;s<br/>
playing...this has kept our connection while he&#39;s playing.<br/>
<br/>
-planning outings that I know he likes (go-carts, movies [especially<br/>
openings], ice-cream).<br/>
<br/>
-still asking for help when I would like it (he is still responding to this,<br/>
in particular he likes taking care of animal feedings...however it&#39;s usually<br/>
not an immediate response)<br/>
<br/>
-writing notes to him rather than interrupt the live action...he asked for<br/>
this from all of us (there are 6 of us in the family). He has a hard time<br/>
listening to any of us when he is on listening to the players...so we write<br/>
him notes and he reads them as soon as his attention can break away.<br/>
<br/>
Showing this respect I think is really important.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, I trust that he is doing what he needs to do with this. He has<br/>
stopped the weekly karate that he has been taking for over a year and a<br/>
half, I think mostly to play Xbox live. There have definitely been times of<br/>
wonder for both dh and me, but we&#39;re pretty sure we need to be the ones<br/>
staying connected to him in respectful ways, rather than *forcing* him to<br/>
come to us to stay connected.<br/>
<br/>
We also give him feedback about things as we see them. For instance, he<br/>
became very pale after while of playing (like the first month) and began to<br/>
*look* unhealthy, complete with dark circles around his eyes. We told him we<br/>
thought his body was showing effects of lowered physical activity and lack<br/>
of sunshine...maybe even lack what food he may need. It was a great<br/>
conversation. Cam talked about how he (his body) felt after this somewhat<br/>
change in lifestyle. He does take on more thought about his body...I noticed<br/>
that he will go outside for a while and run around, chase the dogs during<br/>
the day. I think this may be more specifically to stay healthy while playing<br/>
Xbox than because he feels like running with the dogs, but that seems like<br/>
good enough reason for me!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have an &quot;end of the tunnel&quot; view for you as we are smack dab in the<br/>
middle ourselves. I don&#39;t know where it will lead, but we are staying<br/>
connected for the ride.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing...Cam has LONG hair...down to his butt. The head piece for<br/>
Xbox live has become SO tangled in his hair SO many times that his head is<br/>
one huge dreadlock. Uncombable. Untangleable. Not just a tangled mess...One<br/>
Big gnarled matted thick dreadlock. He is not happy about it, but hasn&#39;t<br/>
made any decisions about what to do about it yet, if anything. We&#39;ve tried<br/>
everything we know to comb it, with no success. But that is a separate<br/>
thread :0)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Jacki<br/>
