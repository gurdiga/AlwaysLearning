I haven&#39;t seen this movie. I read the article & felt I should pass it on. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-933728400">We went to see it yesterday.  We felt compelled because we live only a few<br/>
miles from where they filmed the downtown scenes and had enjoyed watching<br/>
all of the scenery go up, and Dan had gotten to see a bit of filming there<br/>
too.  As for the movie, I think the original poster was asking if it was<br/>
appropriate for preschoolers - and I have to say that I don&#39;t think it is.<br/>
I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything in it to scar them for life, but there&#39;s<br/>
enough tacky stuff that I think I&#39;d just pass on it for my kid if he were<br/>
still little.  There is a half hour animated made for television version<br/>
that is much truer to the book that I understand to be quite good.  Not that<br/>
I am a stickler for books and movies having to match, but I just don&#39;t think<br/>
tiny kids need jokes about &quot;dirty hoe&#39;s&quot; (a garden hoe), or Paris Hilton, or<br/>
butt cracks thrown into a film like this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-795898791">Thanks for the info. I was pretty sure that it wasn&#39;t just based on<br/>
what I saw<br/>
on the previews. I just wonder how many folks are going to take their<br/>
young<br/>
children just because it *is* the cat and the hat. I have a feeling that<br/>
Dr<br/>
Suess is rolling in his grave...I know that he did not want his stories<br/>
to be<br/>
mass marketed.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily my almost 7 year old has shown no interest in going...he has<br/>
seen the<br/>
previews and it does not seem to appeal to him. I will just avoid<br/>
mentioning<br/>
it to my 3 yo. :o)<br/>
<br/>
I remember very fondly the animated Cat in the Hat, just like we love<br/>
the<br/>
animated Grinch who stole Christmas (we did not go see the new grinch<br/>
movie<br/>
last year either). I just really think that they missed the boat big<br/>
time<br/>
with both movies...oh well.<br/>
