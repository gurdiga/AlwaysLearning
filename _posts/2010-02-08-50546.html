<div id="ygrps-yiv-2021380807">I was contemplating the new &#39;hand-holding&quot; list that has come up. I read<br/>
the various threads, opinions of different people. I found two aspects<br/>
intriguing - the need and the risks, which seem to be exclusive stances<br/>
taken by members.<br/>
<br/>
There seems to be a need among some members to find &quot;softer guidance&quot;, which<br/>
is *not* the same as not working on themselves. I understand this to mean<br/>
that they would like acknowledgment of what is and where they need to go<br/>
more than &#39;troubleshooting&#39;. It is obviously not impossible, if we look at<br/>
many transformative methodologies. It is possible to focus on desired change<br/>
to create it. We find what we seek, and seeking problems with what is<br/>
happening quickly leads newcomers into insecure terrain, while experienced<br/>
members cope fluidly based on their understanding of the method. Some<br/>
withdraw, others challenge, still others form breakaway groups, but the need<br/>
underlying them is the same - finding understanding (as distinct from hand<br/>
holding and mollycoddling) in a way that they feel understood. Experienced<br/>
members often understand. Sometimes better than the person with the issue,<br/>
but it feels judgmental, since we are not at an experience level to &#39;get<br/>
it&#39;. I had a great deal of trouble with this initially (not that I promise<br/>
its over, but...).<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, a separate list seems risky terrain too. It would be too<br/>
easy for a bunch of new comers (including me) to pat each other on the back<br/>
and go &quot;there, there, its all right...&quot;. It is easy to blur the lines<br/>
between acceptance of a person and compromising goals. Even this quote of<br/>
mine could be either, depending on context.<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if mentoring could fill the need and reduce risks of<br/>
&quot;slipping into complacency&quot;. If newbies finding it difficult to cope could<br/>
find experienced mentors of &quot;their favorite input flavor&quot;, they would slowly<br/>
learn to find that &quot;gentleness&quot; in the list itself in the caring; without<br/>
needing to withdraw or find alternate resources of dubious value.<br/>
Versatility is a strength in a guide. A list like this is a tremendous<br/>
source for finding it, which a new list could not be. Could we leverage it<br/>
to everyone&#39;s happiness?<br/>
<br/>
Has something like this been tried by unschoolers rather than the risk of<br/>
breakaway kindergarten lists people never graduate from? &lt;-- I got this<br/>
concern from something Sandra wrote<br/>
<br/>
&quot;...people stay on bad trails instead of getting onto good ones. And the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; stronger responses were coming from mothers with less experience. Same<br/>
&gt; emotional experience, less practical benefit....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is a difficult place for a newbie. Either shut up and cope with something<br/>
that is not helping you because it is on another level, or withdraw and go<br/>
elsewhere and risk derailing your entire purpose for getting into all this.<br/>
A mentor could help get over &quot;stucks&quot; and defensive anger and misunderstood<br/>
intentions and understand the underlying processes helping people cope<br/>
better and quicker and learn all through rather than be silenced to some<br/>
back shelf and looked at later if they survive.<br/>
<br/>
I am not questioning how things are done, just looking at possibilities that<br/>
may exist for damage control of newbie acclimatization for the hundreds in<br/>
here that keep going through it all the time new people join and also the<br/>
newbies themselves who find it difficult to find value when they are so busy<br/>
defending themselves difficult to take expressions. It may also help us cope<br/>
with things we find extreme and want to reject and look underneath our<br/>
reactions to the message and its meaning for us.<br/>
<br/>
Vidyut<br/>
<br/>
PS: Now, I&#39;m cringing at how Sandra will rip this post apart. Then I look at<br/>
myself and ask for that trust and acceptance that she does it not because<br/>
she hates me, but because she sees areas for alarm. If I&#39;d like trust and<br/>
acceptance of my intentions, I &#39;should&#39; find the courage to live it too, no?<br/>
Then I look at this whole process and see how it could be much more<br/>
supportive, if I could sound the idea off an experienced mentor rather than<br/>
litter every inbox on the list if it is not really useful and I take a deep<br/>
breath and hit &#39;send&#39;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1840802643">A couple of recommendations for the folks looking for softer *voice* for<br/>
unschooling:<br/>
<br/>
First, get to a conference! Meet unschoolers of every variety, hear<br/>
speakers, engage your kids -- SEE IT!<br/>
There are (now) a variety of conferences to fit most every family&#39;s style,<br/>
from a very fun waterpark weekend happening right now (no speakers, pure<br/>
gathering joy), to Cameron&#39;s Autodidact Symposium in March (directed more<br/>
towards the young adult unschuestions), to the Life is Good in May & the<br/>
Northeaster Unschooling Conference in August (more traditional unschooling<br/>
conferences -- not to be confused with traditional conferences ::bg::<br/>
And lots more I&#39;m not remembering at 5:30 am<br/>
Meanwhile, here&#39;s a link to my favorite Conference Movie, by Craig Meyer -- ABQ<br/>
2006 &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://vilter.us/liveandlearn2006/mayermovie.html">http://vilter.us/liveandlearn2006/mayermovie.html</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Second, there are audio recordings available<br/>
Parenting Peacefully &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sandradodd.com/parentingpeacefully">http://www.sandradodd.com/parentingpeacefully</a>&gt; is<br/>
available for FREE!!! FREE!! at the bottom of the page. Sandra&#39;s voice is a<br/>
wonderful one to invite into your head, then you know how her posts &quot;sound&quot;<br/>
with her real voice.<br/>
Conference websites/stores also offer recordings of speakers past, at<br/>
least Life<br/>
is Good&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://lifeisgoodconference.com/registration/products-page/presentation-recordings/">http://lifeisgoodconference.com/registration/products-page/presentation-recordings/</a>&gt;<br/>
does!<br/>
And cheap :)<br/>
I couldn&#39;t find the Live and Learn ones, anyone know their status? They&#39;d<br/>
too be a worthwhile investment.<br/>
<br/>
The mentor idea, while wonderful in theory would be one more time draw for<br/>
an unschooling mama, from her family.  These lists are ideal, for moments<br/>
like these, when the most of you are sleeping and so is my son -- I may be<br/>
robbed of a little sleep today, though no one&#39;s being robbed of my attention<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1069951619">I was a newbie on this list and I read and read and read and rarely posted. I didn&#39;t need my voice to be heard to garner information and ideas from here. I didn&#39;t need patience and hand holding to move forward on this bold new path. I needed others posting strong statements of what worked of how to make better choices. If I had waited for someone to speak to me, this non-posting newbie, to change in small incremental ways, well I&#39;d still be waiting and my kids and I would probably not have the relationship we have, the trust we share. <br/>
<br/>
I wax and wane in my ability to post to the list. I don&#39;t have the commitments that have kept Deb, and others, from posting, but I have winter blues that lower my energy, I have two children who I want to be with, I have a husband whose company I revel in. My life is bigger than these lists are to me, sometimes, and at other times I enjoy writing and reading immensely. I do not expect more from the people who post than what they freely give. This is such a gift and such a perspective changing thing for me, the idea of telling the people who make this possible how to best accomodate me, well it seems the epitome of ungrateful. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Anyone&#39;s free to see a need and step in to fill it.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you&#39;re imagining that the regular posters have adapted their  <br/>
style of help to fit Sandra&#39;s parameters for the list.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t speak for others but I&#39;m comfortable posting here because my  <br/>
style already fit Sandra&#39;s parameters. I don&#39;t choose how to help  <br/>
based on what people need. I just do what comes naturally and whoever  <br/>
finds it useful is welcome to read.<br/>
<br/>
I know Ren Allen did or maybe still does offer phone counseling for a  <br/>
fee. Anyone with a phone is free to offer that.<br/>
<br/>
After all these years it&#39;s pretty obvious from the blowups and hurt  <br/>
feelings that a list like this doesn&#39;t suit everyone&#39;s needs. But  <br/>
what the list offers, beyond what Sandra writes, is completely  <br/>
dependent on whatever someone voluntarily sends to the list.<br/>
<br/>
The flavor of a place becomes more concentrated as time passes. The  <br/>
flavor starts off fairly broad but the people who merely sort of like  <br/>
the flavor tend to drift away taking their other flavors with them  <br/>
and those who really like the flavor stay, intensifying that flavor.  <br/>
So this list tends toward analysis flavor because people who like  <br/>
that stay and some contribute.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not a bad thing. It&#39;s just how gatherings of people work.<br/>
<br/>
Another factor is that not everyone who can unschool well can or  <br/>
wants to explain it. Since unschooling is already small to begin  <br/>
with, that&#39;s an even smaller number.<br/>
<br/>
People who enjoy more hand holding style of help are less likely to  <br/>
enjoy this list&#39;s style so the number who do who are on this list is  <br/>
small. And of that small number how many have the skills necessary to  <br/>
mentor someone?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-91342611">It is possible to edit the list to your own liking.  When I started reading about 4 or 5 years ago I agreed with maybe 80% of the posts I read.  The rest of them seemed crazy and I read them aloud to my husband and we laughed at the insanity.  Or I just deleted them.  After a couple of months I decided that if that 80% were right, maybe the rest of it was worth considering.  My thinking changed gradually over a few months.  <br/>
<br/>
One of the great things about all the lists is that the same issues/questions come up again and again.  The ideas that seemed crazy the first time they came up made more sense the second time.  If I wanted more answers in the meantime, I checked the archives and if that did not work, I asked.  New people join the list every day and your questions will help them as well as yourself.  <br/>
<br/>
There are also other unschooling lists out there.  There used to be a list of them all, but I&#39;m not sure anymore.  I belong to several, but only have web access to most of them.  I tend to move around depending I what I need and how much time I have to read.  Belonging to several lists gives me access to lots of archives and lets me pick which one(s) I like best.  Staying on topic and not seconding posts is important to me.  When I have little time to read, I might delete most of the posts in my inbox without reading.  I may only follow one thread and delete the rest.  <br/>
<br/>
These lists exist for the benefit of a large number of people.  Not every post is useful to every person. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2012797659">I&#39;m a newbie, have been absorbing since October. My daughter will be 4 years old next month and would have been slated to start kindergarden in the fall. I have read every post since I joined the list and this is what I have &quot;gotten&quot;...<br/>
<br/>
- read more, post less, then go spend time with your children<br/>
- there is immense value in reading the responses to &quot;other&quot; people&#39;s issues<br/>
- this list is about the ideas, not the individuals who post those ideas, so there is no need to take anything personally<br/>
- keep your heart and mind open, both to the list, but mostly to your own children<br/>
- it&#39;s gradual, so be gentle, with yourself and your children<br/>
<br/>
So I just wanted to say a huge thank you, I like this list just the way it is. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-547462240">-=-There seems to be a need among some members to find &quot;softer  <br/>
guidance&quot;, which<br/>
is *not* the same as not working on themselves-=-<br/>
<br/>
Although I see that many people have responded already, I&#39;m going to  <br/>
write without reading those first.<br/>
<br/>
The goal if this list is not for adult members to &quot;work on  <br/>
themselves.&quot;  It&#39;s for children to be unschooled.  It&#39;s for parents  <br/>
who have decided not to put their children in school to find the tools  <br/>
right now to help in the next moment, at their house, where their  <br/>
children are living their current, busy lives.<br/>
<br/>
Parents need to work on themselves on the side, while unschooling is  <br/>
starting to work.  That&#39;s deschooling.  It might be therapy. It might  <br/>
likely come as a natural side effect of rethinking what they thought  <br/>
they knew before, of replacing &quot;Teach&quot; with &quot;learn.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My site and Joyce&#39;s are full of a growing collection of good writings  <br/>
no one person has ever read all of, FULL of the tools and tricks and  <br/>
mind-opening ideas that will help people work on themselves.<br/>

<br/>
I can&#39;t say people need to read all of those before posting here,  <br/>
because nobody will ever read all of both of those.<br/>
I can say without a bit of hesitation that anyone who wasn&#39;t aware  <br/>
that they existed should not post another word until reading for  <br/>
several hours there.<br/>
<br/>
I have objected to this &quot;we&quot; before, but it might be something the  <br/>
writer is using without thinking.<br/>
Writing without thinking has always been discouraged on this list.  It  <br/>
should be discouraged in every corner of the world where writing can  <br/>
be produced.<br/>

Some run away, others whine and argue and flail and yell, and others  <br/>
think they can do better.<br/>
Yes.  We know.  Some of us have been doing this for a long time.   <br/>
You&#39;re not bringing news to the list.  You&#39;re not bringing unschooling  <br/>
assistance to the list.<br/>
<br/>
-=-... but the need underlying them is the same - finding  <br/>
understanding (as distinct from hand<br/>
holding and mollycoddling) in a way that they feel understood.-=-<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of this list is to help people to understand unschooling,  <br/>
not to help unschoolers understand every person who joins this list  <br/>
for a day or two.<br/>
<br/>
If people want to feel understood, that&#39;s what friends and therapists  <br/>
are for.  This list is for discussing principles and the workings of  <br/>
natural learning, not to hear all about the relatives of every  <br/>
member.  We all have relatives.  There are patterns.  We all have  <br/>
school experiences or memories.  There are patterns.  We all have  <br/>
fears.  There are patterns.  We&#39;re here to discuss the patterns, not  <br/>
the range of the patterns.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Experienced members often understand. Sometimes better than the  <br/>
person with the issue...-=-<br/>
Yes, and that is on the list, and that is the purpose of the list.<br/>
<br/>
-=-...but it feels judgmental, since we are not at an experience level  <br/>
to &#39;get it&#39;. -=-<br/>
But that is not on the list and is not the purpose of the list.<br/>
<br/>
The way someone feels inside should probably be kept inside, most of  <br/>
the time.  Feel it.  If you want to feel differently, there is a great  <br/>
deal of assistance for that purpose already gathered.<br/>

<br/>
This afternoon there&#39;ll be a chat.  Is that hand-holding enough?  Four  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-844709935">-=I know Ren Allen did or maybe still does offer phone counseling for a<br/>
fee. Anyone with a phone is free to offer that.-=-<br/>
<br/>
She told me she didn&#39;t want to do that anymore.  Something (I didn&#39;t  <br/>
ask for more details) about people expecting too much and not really  <br/>
trying to change, I think.  Even for money, she wasn&#39;t willing to  <br/>
spend her time unproductively.<br/>
<br/>
-=-People who enjoy more hand holding style of help are less likely to<br/>
enjoy this list&#39;s style so the number who do who are on this list is<br/>
small. And of that small number how many have the skills necessary to<br/>
mentor someone?-=-<br/>
<br/>
The reason I bring anonymous questions to the list (after telling  <br/>
their authors to come to the list to read the responses) is twofold:   <br/>
Every word I write in public helps lots of people.  What I write in  <br/>
private might not even help one person.  It takes the same amount of  <br/>
time, though, so I prefer to write in public.  It&#39;s my volunteer time  <br/>
and energy and I do get to choose how to apportion it.<br/>
<br/>
The other reason is that maybe my one point of view won&#39;t help, and  <br/>
that&#39;s why having a list like this is so wonderful.  Others will see  <br/>
different aspects and possibilities.  They&#39;ll also see where my own  <br/>
answers might have veered away from the original question, or might be  <br/>
able to tweak something someone else has written to clarify it.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want anyone depending on me for &quot;answers.&quot;  My site isn&#39;t just  <br/>
my voice or writing.<br/>
<br/>
Those who need individual mentoring are probably not going to do well  <br/>
with unschooling, which requires creativity and courage and a LOT of  <br/>
hours with one&#39;s children.  MOST of the hours of every day and week  <br/>
until they&#39;re grown, with one&#39;s children.  Many have moved quickly  <br/>
toward unschooling because they were willing to accept that they  <br/>
didn&#39;t already know it all, and started trying out some of the ideas  <br/>
provided on my site and Joyce&#39;s and on this list and other lists and  <br/>
sites, and in books.<br/>
<br/>
Resources are available.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;    The rest of them seemed crazy and I read them aloud to my husband and we laughed at the insanity.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks for that image, Amanda! I remember feeling bewildered....just <br/>
plain bewildered. I was reading things by Sandra and by others and they <br/>
were really obviously very intelligent women, but some of the things <br/>
they said seemed just so completely and totally unrealistic. I also read <br/>
them to my husband and he was even more bewildered than I was. I was <br/>
also spellbound and thrilled. I couldn&#39;t get enough. I remember feeling <br/>
as if there was an electric shock flowing through my body a few times <br/>
because of things I read. I remember almost gasping for breath, I was <br/>
hit so hard by some things people said.<br/>
<br/>
I hear comments like that about Rue Kream&#39;s book. It happened again the <br/>
other day that someone said they thought it was just completely <br/>
unrealistic. I just smiled - no point in arguing that it very very <br/>
realistically describes my own family&#39;s lifestyle.  The person just <br/>
wasn&#39;t able to stretch their imagination quite that far. Yet. If they <br/>
hang out with my family more, they will be more ready to believe it, I <br/>
think.<br/>
<br/>
So - I&#39;m reiterating what Amanda said - read selectively. Take what <br/>
makes sense. Don&#39;t take anything personally. Just smile or giggle (or <br/>
laugh hysterically) at the stuff that seems over the top.<br/>
<br/>
And - I&#39;d add that anything that gets your ire up, anything that gets <br/>
you feeling defensive, is something you probably need to take a much <br/>
closer look at. For yourself. Because - why on earth would you care to <br/>
stay and defend yourself to a bunch of people you don&#39;t even know. If it <br/>
really didn&#39;t apply, if it meant nothing, if it was totally off the mark <br/>
and you were really sure it was nothing you needed to consider, you&#39;d <br/>
brush it off with barely a thought. You&#39;d think, &quot;Oh, she just doesn&#39;t <br/>
know my family,&quot; or &quot;Huh? She missed the mark on that one,&quot; or &quot;Well, <br/>
that shoe sure doesn&#39;t fit.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If nothing else, maybe people should examine their ned to feel supported <br/>
by perfect strangers of whom you know almost nothing.<br/>
<br/>
Look at the ideas. Think about them. Think about whether they make sense <br/>
TO YOU for your own family. You are not joining a club or sorority and <br/>
you don&#39;t need to be accepted. No rush week. No pledging. No hazing. No <br/>
bid night.<br/>
<br/>
Just read and think. That&#39;s all this list is for. If you like to think <br/>
out loud - then post your ideas. If you don&#39;t like to have your ideas <br/>
carefully and critically examined, don&#39;t post them. You don&#39;t have to. <br/>
Lots of people don&#39;t post, but are reading and thinking a lot. That is <br/>
totally fine. Recommended for newcomers. Recommended for those with very <br/>
young children. Or, if you&#39;re a little too eager to wait for topics to <br/>
naturally come around - ask questions that encourage people to post more <br/>
on topics you&#39;re interested in thinking about more. That works too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1400524571">***It is a difficult place for a newbie. Either shut up and cope with<br/>
something<br/>
that is not helping you because it is on another level, or withdraw and go<br/>

this.****<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it is about shutting up, as it is about keep reading the<br/>
hundreds of pages that already exist on Sandra&#39;s website and also Joyce&#39;s.<br/>
No need to withdraw or go anywhere else.<br/>
<br/>
The *support* for me comes from the the existence of this list.<br/>
From the time and effort, by people I had never met, had taken to write and<br/>
organize this information and keep in a place that I could find when I<br/>
needed it most.<br/>
<br/>
It was a lot to understand at first, so I picked something small and simple<br/>
that resonated with me the most at the time. I started focusing on whether<br/>
the little things during the day were creating more peaceful relationships -<br/>
were my words and choices building up a relationship or tearing it down.<br/>
Just one choice at time.  I kept reading and felt *mentored* by the fact<br/>
that good, informative and thoughtful emails were continuing to arrive in my<br/>
inbox each day - free.<br/>

*********<br/>
<br/>
yes - but some people need a &quot;launch&quot; - someone to open the door- or even SHOW them the door, to a different way.  for some, they are not even really aware that a different paradigm exists, and so seeking out lists and books just doesn&#39;t occur to them. <br/>
<br/>
i teach parenting classes.  i co-teach actually, so that addresses  your &quot;not just one voice&quot; thing, slightly.<br/>
<br/>
we&#39;ve evolved how we do it over the years, and the current format is a 2 hour intro, at which point, if the &quot;fit&quot; seems right, participants can sign up for  once  every other week (we might change it to once a month) discussion group.  <br/>
<br/>
the truth is, many many people have moved from taking our class, in an attempt to find a more gentle, mindful way of parenting, to unschooling, and quite quickly.  <br/>
<br/>
while maybe someone who needs a mentor on an ongoing basis might struggle more with unschooling, a transitional mentor can be really valuable, i think.  i had someone like that when i first started unschooling (my kids were older) and just to be able to say what was on my mind, and have someone i trusted, who was *good* at unschooling, be direct with me about what she was observing, was really incredibly helpful.  i try to do the same for the people who come to me.  since i don&#39;t have *that* much experience with unschooling, i generally include in my suggestions and interpretations, many many links to pages on your and joyce&#39;s site, and encourage them to join unschooling lists, over and over again.  and they do - if they are serious.<br/>
<br/>
i have seen resistance, resistance, resistance - all of a sudden light goes on.  but that wouldn&#39;t  necessarily have happened, or not as quickly, or not without crisis first, without someone shining a light on the path....<br/>
<br/>
we do charge for the classes, but i also give away lots of email time at no charge. it&#39;s actually really hard for me to make time to go to the classes, which is why they are infrequent, and why we charge.  that and also, wanting people to feel invested not just be &quot;checking it out&quot; because it&#39;s free.  <br/>

<br/>
Then those people will never find this list, right?<br/>
<br/>
Those who can&#39;t do some looking around will have a hard time helping  <br/>
their kids look around, I think.  A large part of unschooling is  <br/>
exploration, and unless someone wants to guide a family for twelve or  <br/>
eighteen years, we can&#39;t be promising the mountaintop to those who  <br/>
don&#39;t really want to leave the house.<br/>
<br/>
-=-while maybe someone who needs a mentor on an ongoing basis might  <br/>

valuable, i think. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I met unschoolers at La Leche League meetings.  People go to  <br/>
conferences now to meet other unschoolers, or to regional campouts.<br/>
<br/>
-=- i had someone like that when i first started unschooling (my kids  <br/>
were older) and just to be able to say what was on my mind, and have  <br/>
someone i trusted, who was *good* at unschooling, be direct with me  <br/>
about what she was observing, was really incredibly helpful. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the first people who jump up and offer help are not  <br/>
necessarily those who are good at unschooling.  A couple of people  <br/>
have come up with the beginnings of schemes to somehow certify  <br/>
unschooling group leaders or mentors, but those people with the big  <br/>
plans had personal problems themselves that weren&#39;t likely to lend  <br/>
themselves to clarity or helping people with kids older than theirs  <br/>
were, certainly.   I hope those plans have completely died down,  <br/>
because they&#39;re leading away from each unschooling parent learning in  <br/>
and for herself what she would need to be a successful unschooler with  <br/>
her own children in her own home.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
We see that here too, but we miss the beautiful facial expression of  <br/>
the light going on.  Sometimes people send me notes, though.  I save  <br/>
parts of some of them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You had a friend.<br/>
<br/>
If what is being suggested is that it would help newbie unschoolers to <br/>
be friends with experienced unschoolers, then I couldn&#39;t agree more. <br/>
Sandra had people in her real life who inspired her and she could see in <br/>
person how they were with their kids, etc. I did too.<br/>
<br/>
Good idea.<br/>
<br/>
But - this idea of mentors sounds more like someone wanting to set up a <br/>
system, a program, a group...something organized to provide mentors.<br/>
<br/>
I have good friends - and I think sometimes I am acting as a mentor, <br/>
because I&#39;m older and my kids are older and I have more experience and <br/>
I&#39;m pretty good at analyzing other people&#39;s situations and coming up <br/>
with some possible options for them to consider. But, just want to say, <br/>
that these are friends - this is something friends DO for each other. <br/>
Unschooling and parenting discussion is something I have to offer some <br/>
of my friends, but they have other things to offer me.  And these <br/>
relationships developed over time - we got to know each other and liked <br/>
each other.<br/>
<br/>
As far as parenting classes, go, people had to seek those out, too. And <br/>
they are group activities, not one-on-one mentoring.<br/>

<br/>
Can this list be changed so that it makes one person happy so that she  <br/>
can say &quot;now everyone (meaning herself) is happy&quot;?<br/>
No.  This list should not be changed because one person who says &quot;we&quot;  <br/>
and &quot;us&quot; too much can be happy.<br/>
<br/>
This list isn&#39;t intended to make adults happy.  It is intended to help  <br/>
adults change so that their children can be happy, after which the  <br/>
adults can be happy.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  yes, although there are different degrees of looking around.  people who decide to pull their kids out of school but don&#39;t know about unschooling, kids are older, they are not involved with LLL anymore, or they know about unschooling but they search online about it and find law of attraction stuff and get turned off &lt;BWG&gt;, or, the latest experience for me, a neighbor who went through a year+ long process of walking with me, talking with me, listening, observing, reading, experiencing more trauma with her child in school, and finally feeling ready to take the plunge.  yes it would have been better to do it earlier. yes, there is probably lasting damage.  but she is really &quot;seeing the light&quot; now and i believe she WILL make a good unschooler.  my story is similar.  i was aware of unschooling from the time my first child was 2 - my best friend is a lifelong radical unschooler.  while i totally supported her and saw the value in it, for some bizarre reason i still haven&#39;t figured out, i still didn&#39;t apply it to myself and my family, until i was literally forced into it through crisis.  so yes, i have personal experience that might color what i share with others, but i think it only colors it in the direction of the urgency of &#39;getting it&quot;.  and i mostly get inquiries from parents with kids who are or would be experiencing similar crisis in school - not the ones that are getting along &quot;fine&quot;.  and because i took my kids out late, i do have the frame of reference of what deschooling can look like and what happens on the other end.  a living example of that (i know there  are many others!) <br/>
<br/>
  if that neighbor had never opened up to me - if i had never shared my journey - she wouldn&#39;t have come to this particular decision. or maybe she would have, but it might have taken longer.  she didn&#39;t pay me, it&#39;s true, but she&#39;s my neighbor.  others never would have &quot;found&quot; me if not for the classes.  <br/>
<br/>
  that said, i was just telling my teaching partner/friend that sometimes i prefer the free email help and guidance to the teaching/classes.  but they do dovetail with each other. <br/>

<br/>
But - this idea of mentors sounds more like someone wanting to set up a <br/>
system, a program, a group...something organized to provide mentors.<br/>

<br/>
oh - never mind then! lol.  i apologize for not reading the entire thread before responding. i totally agree a &quot;system&quot; is not a good way to get mentorship.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-147901252">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Thank you everyone. These responses have given me much to think about. In<br/>
any case, I wasn&#39;t looking at a system as such, more like requests for short<br/>
duration. But then these probably happen to some extent through off-list<br/>
conversations when people &quot;click&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;US&quot; and &quot;WE&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
I was looking at the new community thread and the conversations that led up<br/>
to it. When I said we, I was looking speaking of inexperienced newcomers or<br/>
people otherwise having trouble unschooling. It wasn&#39;t a complaint. In fact,<br/>
I am fine with the list these days. It took me a bit, but I am going great.<br/>
Wasn&#39;t about my happiness being called the community&#39;s happiness. I manage<br/>
mine just fine most of the time.<br/>
<br/>
As I read the responses, I see that it is really each one&#39;s choice,<br/>
including mine. If I am still here, I am still here. If someone finds well<br/>
being in starting their own list, that is their call and I am not required<br/>
to approve of it as a &#39;good learning choice&#39;. I was feeling concerned that<br/>
people who obviously were having trouble were walking off into the storm on<br/>
their own. I was wondering if there are possibilities unexplored that could<br/>
help them right here. The &#39;we&#39; was because I identified with them by virtue<br/>
of being new. It did seem that newcomers had different kinds of things on<br/>
our mind than more seasoned unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
I see now that much of what I was attempting to do was futile. No matter how<br/>
a community is, there will be people not in their element, and its okay.<br/>
More useful working with what is than looking at what&#39;s missing. What&#39;s<br/>
missing will always be infinite.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;That&#39;s not a bad thing. It&#39;s just how gatherings of people work.&quot; &lt;-- I<br/>
&#39;get it&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
More than that, I see that it boils down to trusting people to take what<br/>
works even if it seems improbable to me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-192956573">***I can&#39;t speak for others but I&#39;m comfortable posting here because my <br/>
style already fit Sandra&#39;s parameters. I don&#39;t choose how to help <br/>
based on what people need. I just do what comes naturally and whoever <br/>
finds it useful is welcome to read.***<br/>
<br/>
Right!  AND Sandra is completely free to tell me I&#39;m wrong about something, or question what I say, and she&#39;s done that and that&#39;s GOOD for me!<br/>
<br/>
***I know Ren Allen did or maybe still does offer phone counseling for a <br/>
fee. Anyone with a phone is free to offer that.***<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t know Ren did that!  Ren is wonderful and amazing!<br/>
<br/>
***Another factor is that not everyone who can unschool well can or <br/>
wants to explain it. Since unschooling is already small to begin <br/>
with, that&#39;s an even smaller number.***<br/>
<br/>
I have an unschooling friend that rarely goes online, if ever.  She&#39;s a great mom and really understands unschooling.  She didn&#39;t need to have her life on an unschooling list discussing unschooling.  She spent her time in her garden and with her kids.<br/>

<br/>
It happens every day on this list.<br/>

I think you mean that it boils down to letting this list be what it is <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2041174751">What is missing may seem infinite but it&#39;s not as difficult to implement<br/>
once the ideas have some time to gel a bit with experience. Like someone<br/>
else mentioned, take what resonates and begin in small practical ways to<br/>
unschool. If you&#39;re like most people, that will be encouraging and it will<br/>
raise more questions too. I read extensively for years because I started<br/>
looking into unschooling ideas at the same time I came across other<br/>
parenting philosophies when Karl wasn&#39;t even 1 year old and I had some<br/>
luxury of time until he would have been &quot;school age.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I quickly became passionate about the idea enough to really delve much much<br/>
more into the writings, purchased some of Holt&#39;s books eventually, as well<br/>
as books by other unschoolers such as Peggy Pirro and Rue Kream. I think<br/>
you&#39;re lucky because here you are and Sandra Dodd&#39;s writings and website<br/>
content by other authors is now available in book form... an incredible<br/>
resource! It just keeps getting easier and easier as the years go by to get<br/>
informed and to research and follow up on information.<br/>
<br/>
So I came at unschooling by reading voraciously on the subject and trying it<br/>
out in my own home without really knowing that many unschoolers in real<br/>
life, only having occasionally met a few here and there. Do try unschooling<br/>
at home (and wherever you and your child/ren may roam in the big wide world<br/>
;)! Certainly feel free! Don&#39;t wait around. Start as soon as you can, and<br/>
that by itself will (more than likely) build in you lots of confidence and<br/>
plenty of steam for unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s missing really is not infinite. Not to worry.<br/>

<br/>
In some communities &quot;easy&quot; isn&#39;t applicable.<br/>
<br/>
I know of two unschoolers in India, and neither is near the same city  <br/>
as Vidyut, as far as I know.  There are isolated unschoolers in Italy,  <br/>
South Africa, a family in China...<br/>
<br/>
I also know that it&#39;s possible for people to unschool without an in- <br/>
person mentor.<br/>
I also know that some find e-mail friends or phone friends, or travel  <br/>
to visit other families, even without conferences.<br/>
Some go to a conference and meet other people and keep in touch with  <br/>
some of them.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a wide range of resources, and if online is the best thing  <br/>
someone has, then it&#39;s the best.  And it&#39;s pretty endless, the online  <br/>
resource.<br/>

<br/>
I think the above is a very good idea in real life or online, in any<br/>
situation, because ultimately I will want to make my own decisions based on<br/>
whatever comes to hand that might conceivably enhance (or hinder)<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
My own experience has been that even when people are reliable and their<br/>
example is fabulous, I don&#39;t find myself taking what they do or are and<br/>
making it programmatic for my life. What&#39;s organic for one is not<br/>
necessarily natural or helpful for another. Finding other unschoolers is<br/>
more like finding diversity within all and appreciating one&#39;s own potential<br/>
for living and creating an unschooling lifestyle for oneself in concert and<br/>
together with other family members in the home.<br/>
<br/>
Toronto is a metropolis. A wonderful wide open place of possibilities for<br/>
unschooling networking. Maybe I&#39;ll get to travel there someday and take in<br/>
the scene. But many many unschoolers are like me, in the rural pockets all<br/>
over the U.S. and Canada and elsewhere internationally. Some of these places<br/>
are much more remote than others. That&#39;s ok. We do have the internet,<br/>
so....  I take advantage of that amazing resource with zero apologies. :D<br/>
