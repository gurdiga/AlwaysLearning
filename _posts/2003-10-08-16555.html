<div id="ygrps-yiv-735729598">Namaste all!  I am new here also : )  My two are Brendan (20) & Amber (10 on <br/>
the 23rd.) I homeschooled/unschooled Brendan from 3rd grade on. Amber has <br/>
always been schooled at home. I have been reading the posts for a couple of <br/>
months now and really appreciated everyone!  I am very happy to be a part of <br/>
this group. We are in Gulf Breeze, Florida (panhandle next to Pensacola.) In <br/>
May we joined the local unschooling group (LIFE) directed by an AWESOME <br/>
person, Ren..many of you know her here : ) ...peace all, Sonja<br/>
<br/>
PS. Hi Sandra. I&#39;ve read so many of your articles. Your insight is VERY much <br/>
appreciated!<br/>
