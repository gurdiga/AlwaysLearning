<div id="ygrps-yiv-1341176564">&quot;I&#39;ve been thinking of posting that I think maybe we should have just had an <br/>
underground, secret unschooling movement by invitation only, because those <br/>
who don&#39;t understand it are making the rest of us look bad. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 And that since some families CAN&#39;T pull it off, for whatever reasons, that <br/>
it would have been better for them not to try, and we could screen people in <br/>
advance to see if they were flexible, creative, energetic and trusting enough <br/>
to make it work.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I wrote that to someone privately just yesterday.  I&#39;m glad the conversation <br/>
has gone as it has today.<br/>
<br/>
So here&#39; a first-draft pro-list:<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers need to be <br/>
<br/>
flexible<br/>
creative<br/>
energetic<br/>
trusting<br/>
knowledgeable and willing to learn more<br/>
interested in how people learn<br/>
happy in their lives--optimistic to peaceful<br/>
aware of the joy in small things<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What will work against unschooling:<br/>
<br/>
cynicism<br/>
impatience<br/>
meanness<br/>
jealousy (of your children&#39;s happiness, of your friends&#39; reports of success)<br/>
bad parental voices in your head<br/>
violence, drug use, alcoholism (anything making the parents unsafe or <br/>
unreliable)<br/>
priority given to spotless, quiet, orderly house<br/>
agoraphobia on the part of the mom (if kids are stuck home, they&#39;re very <br/>
limited)<br/>
prejudice against modern media (computers, videos, TV)<br/>
book-worship<br/>
hope to find a full school curriculum buried in everyday life<br/>
desire to TEACH<br/>
desire to control the child&#39;s thoughts and beliefs<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone care to add to those or suggest some to be pulled or amended?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I would definitely add PATIENCE to the top of the &quot;must be&quot; list and I&#39;d take &quot;book worship&quot; off the work against list. I might not understand what you mean by book worship? Personally I don&#39;t know if I could be happy without books? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;hope to find a full school curriculum buried in everyday life&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One more thing. I would think, that if you can&#39;t find a full curriculum buried in everyday life, it would be difficult to unschool?<br/>

<br/>
I think if you&#39;re looking for the curriculum, you&#39;re not really unschooling.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t be happy without books.  But I don&#39;t tell a kid to turn off that <br/>
Ten Commandments movie and go get a book about Egypt.  I don&#39;t say &quot;Don&#39;t try <br/>
to make a marionette until you&#39;ve read everything in the house and the <br/>
nearest library on marionettes.&quot;  Some people do.  Some people think &quot;real <br/>
learning&quot; is in books, and the other stuff is for afterwards.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Booklearning.&quot;  The very term, with all its connotations, is something for <br/>
unschoolers to stay clear of.<br/>

more like this but I&#39;m not.  I addition to not being able to learn <br/>
well from the written word, I can&#39;t understand the meaning of many <br/>
charts and graphs.  I need to be shown and I need to hear.  It <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t try to get what I can from books but without <br/>
other sources I&#39;d be lost.<br/>
<br/>
I really wish I could find more on video tape.  I&#39;m trying to teach <br/>
myself to play the piano and I can&#39;t find what I need.<br/>

Virginia is the same as I am.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is where Lars and I are so different.  We&#39;re at opposite ends of this <br/>
spectrum.  I never try to do anything without reading the instructions, and <br/>
I always turn to books first when I want to learn something new.  Lars <br/>
wouldn&#39;t consider reading the instructions, though he just *might* look at <br/>
any pictures.  He just jumps in and starts fooling around with something to <br/>
see how it works.  And for him, learning never comes from the printed <br/>
word.  It&#39;s been a real struggle for me to accept that his way is just as <br/>
valid as mine.  And that each way has its downside.<br/>
<br/>
We recently got a digital camera, and I set out reading the instructions <br/>
and trying to figure it all out.  Lars had the basics figured out long <br/>
before I did.  But there are things that I could show him how to do that he <br/>
probably would never have figured out on his own, because I read the <br/>
instructions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1487759907">Hmmmm I don&#39;t have agoraphobia, but we are stuck at<br/>
home, most of the time.  I go WAY beyond half-way to<br/>
arrange get togethers. I do make an effort to go.<br/>
However it is an effort. Real effort, I try to conceal<br/>
it as best I can, but the physical toll on me is<br/>
something that is I have to take into account. <br/>
<br/>
HOWEVER  we live in a field trip. Always have. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think stuck at home is necessarily limiting. <br/>
Just depends on the home.<br/>
