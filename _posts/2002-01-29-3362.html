<div id="ygrps-yiv-925409961">I totally agree with you all about using the term &quot;eclectic&quot; or some other <br/>
word...but NOT Unschooling.<br/>
I was at least aware enough all of these years to not call myself an <br/>
Unschooler even though I heavily leaned before finally letting go.<br/>
I told people &quot;I lean towards Unschooling Philosophies&quot;  and even had a group <br/>
called &quot;Eclectic Homeschoolers&quot; and actually met a total Unschooler through <br/>
it.<br/>
It irritates the heck out of me when groups like that WAUnschoolers use the <br/>
title, because they do a huge disservice to anyone really trying to <br/>
understand unschooling.<br/>
No Andrea, they are NOT Unschoolers. I can tell just from the small amount <br/>
that you posted.<br/>
And it wouldn&#39;t be worth my time to go to their site and discuss it with <br/>
them. They don&#39;t get it, my posts won&#39;t help them.<br/>
At Unschooling.com I DO feel it could make a difference though.<br/>
And the way the entire battle resurfaced, was that I questioned a brand new <br/>
unschooler over her comment &quot;and if our kids get behind, we will help them&quot; <br/>
or something to that effect.<br/>
I got completely slammed by a couple of people that said &quot;do it YOUR own way&quot; <br/>
and then JoAnna came on and pointed out that the list was lacking in <br/>
substance...<br/>
blah, blah, blah.<br/>
Some of us are very passionate about pure, radical unschooling. I do not try <br/>
and shove my views down anyone&#39;s throat that doesn&#39;t want it. By posting at a <br/>
public UNSCHOOL board, they are asking for my opinion and anyone elses that <br/>
wants to give it. And hey, I never said &quot;don&#39;t do it that way&quot; I just don&#39;t <br/>
like it being called Unschooling.<br/>
YK?<br/>
People want to have this ambiguous definition of Unschooling. I say it&#39;s <br/>
fairly easy to define, because we have many of John Holt&#39;s books!! How it <br/>
applies to other areas of life can be a grey area, but that&#39;s why  I turn to <br/>
people like Sandra, Joyce and Pam (among others) to get a feel for how they <br/>
handle certain situations.<br/>
I have a deep respect for them and how they are raising their kids.<br/>
So it makes sense to turn to them for advice when I&#39;m not sure about <br/>
something.<br/>
These ladies have EARNED the right to some respect by their peers and new <br/>
Unschoolers imo!!<br/>
I mean Sandra has been deeply entrenched in the public school system (having <br/>
been a teacher) I think she knows what the heck she&#39;s talking about when she <br/>
speaks for Unschooling!!!!<br/>
Anyhoooo...<br/>
I&#39;ll shut up now. I just wanted you to know that I don&#39;t think your WA group <br/>
are Unschoolers at all.<br/>
And I&#39;d be happy to look in my old issue of GWS and see where some <br/>
Unschoolers are in the Seattle area. I would guess that anyone in that <br/>
directory would be closer to true Unschooling than the people on your e-mail <br/>
list.<br/>
It would be a good start anyway.<br/>
Although any homeschoolers can be a good support network for friendships.<br/>
My oldest ds has a best friend in ps, so friends are in any walk of life of <br/>
course. But it is nice to &quot;let your guard&quot; down so to speak and not have to <br/>
explain why you do things the way you do.<br/>
I have had good experiences with many of the homeschoolers here. The ones <br/>
that judge me and think I&#39;m nuts, don&#39;t talk to me. So it works out fine.<br/>
The ones I get along great with are willing to accept my views without <br/>
judgement. Even though they do things different.<br/>
