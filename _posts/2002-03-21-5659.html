<div id="ygrps-yiv-830875201">I just wanted to add to these two threads.<br/>
<br/>
First, on the famous Tampa vacation, I took the girls to the Tampa Aquarium.  <br/>
We loved it!!  Ila (2.5) is now saying, &quot;I the manatee girl!&quot;  She&#39;s very <br/>
excited about these gentle animals (we even got a plastic model from the <br/>
machine that makes them as you wait).  Of course, it was a weekday and there <br/>
were many school groups with nametags, uniforms and clipboards with <br/>
worksheets on them.  So many children (about grades 1-3) were simply skimming <br/>
the info cards for the &quot;right answers&quot; and not even watching the <br/>
animals/fish.  I was pointing out the cool stuff (otters, turtles, wading <br/>
birds, etc) in the native Florida section while trying not to let the girls <br/>
get away from me and/or get trampled by the herd.  I even mentioned to one <br/>
teacher (who had her won clipboard with worksheet on it), &quot;Don&#39;t you <br/>
sometimes wish you could just bring the kids here without the questions to <br/>
ask?&quot;  She said, &quot;Yes, and I also wish we could spend more time here.  It <br/>
takes longer to organize and get here and back to school than the time we get <br/>
inside looking.&quot;  How sad!  <br/>
<br/>
Dawn,  we own Kiki and get Totoro from the library.  My kids have nearly <br/>
memorized all the dialogue from Kiki and walk around quoting, &quot;Pardon me, <br/>
Miss Snooty Cat.&quot; and laughing hysterically.  As soon as we saw Kiki say, &quot;I <br/>
can&#39;t just take her money and not help.&quot;, DH said, &quot;We are buying this movie!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Gosh, I haven&#39;t used so many quote marks in quite a while.<br/>
<br/>
Shyrley:  if you are in the Asheville, NC area this summer look us up.  We&#39;ve <br/>
got some space and are always up for playing!<br/>
<br/>
Kathryn:  My theory as to why women get more liberal while men get more <br/>
conservative with age is this:  Women have less to lose as they age and their <br/>
&quot;commodities&quot; of youth and beauty lessen as their wisdom and vitality <br/>
increase.  The culture does not notice the less young and beautiful, so there <br/>
is less pressure to be &quot;in the box&quot;.  Men, on the other hand, increase in <br/>
stature, financial responsibility, and social pressure as they age.  There is <br/>
more expectation that they have &quot;sown their wild oats&quot; and will settle down <br/>
and be responsible and contribute to society for the furtherment of others <br/>
like them.  It&#39; s sad, but true for the poor guys.  <br/>
<br/>
DiAnna, who waxes philosophical in the spring rain, and who now better go do <br/>
something fun like play tickle with the kids : )</div>
