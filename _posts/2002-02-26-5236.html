<div id="ygrps-yiv-153357198">Renee:  I&#39;ve had to do the same thing with my mother.  She&#39;s has constantly<br/>
stuck her nose in and decided what&#39;s best for my life and the life of my<br/>
children and doesn&#39;t &quot;approve&quot; of homeschooling (much less unschooling)...<br/>
Hubby and I, over this weekend, have decided NOT to move to the new house we<br/>
are having built in Tucson/Vail.  We are going to move directly to Northern<br/>
California by August of this year and get where we actually want to<br/>
go....Those of you living in Northern California.... it would be great if<br/>
you would e-mail me privately and let me know more about your area.  We need<br/>
all the support you guys have to give to do this giant move, and yet we know<br/>
it&#39;s the best thing for us.<br/>
<br/>
