********************************<br/>
Well the proof is in the pudding.  I have a four year old myself and I am happy to hear unschooling has produced two wonderful teenagers.  I have always heard if it works don&#39;t fix it.  I also try to provide information if I can.  I am not TCS and I have on occassion been slammed by those who are but there is a website if you&#39;re interested.  Here it is www.takingchildrenseriously.com  I tried to do a search on the Jan Fortune lady but nothing came up.  Funny, when I did a search on Sandra Dodd several hits did.  I myself will stick with unschooling and attachment parenting and listen with an open mind to those who are willing to share more alternatives than I may be able to come up with on my own.  I do not believe in living with resentment or being a martyr.  We have a household filled with love and happy people.  I do not do everything by myself and I do require(coerce/request) help picking up.<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.autonomouschild.co.uk/">http://www.autonomouschild.co.uk/</a>   She has several books and writes for<br/>
Life Learning Magazine.  <br/>
