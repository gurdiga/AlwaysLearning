<div id="ygrps-yiv-134281537">So I&#39;m working on this book, right?  And it&#39;s supposed to be the  <br/>
good parts of my site (the stuff I wrote, anyway; can&#39;t quote the best  <br/>
of other people without finding them all and getting releases and all  <br/>
that), and I thought it would be mostly cut and paste, but what chance  <br/>
was there I could just cut and paste without commenting or rephrasing?<br/>
<br/>
Some of the pages are way too long and just need a summary anyway.    <br/>
So I was writing and this came out:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Rules discourage thought.  Principles require thought.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I thought that might be a good addition to the record and the communal  <br/>
thinking here.<br/>
<br/>
When someone&#39;s going to follow a rule, the only choice he&#39;s making is  <br/>
whether to follow the rule or break the rule.   There&#39;s motive and  <br/>
emotion in there.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When someone&#39;s going to make a decision based on a principle there&#39;s a  <br/>
range of right answers!<br/>

though much of what&#39;s above isn&#39;t there at all).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-262209098"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt; Rules discourage thought.  Principles require thought.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How does this work long-term?  If I live a principle so often/much/long that<br/>
it becomes habitual, is thought still required?  Will the principles then be<br/>
&quot;habits&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Is &quot;thoughtful&quot; living the same as &quot;mindful&quot; living?<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;m wanting to rewrite it in my mind as &quot;Principles encourage<br/>
thought&quot;, since it balances the &quot;discourage&quot; better.  Yet I can clearly see<br/>
that living by principles instead of rules requires thought, so I wonder why<br/>
am I reacting this way?  <br/>
