I think that the kid wants Pepsi and is &quot;manipulating&quot; her POOR CLUELESS mother- ha! and wanting attention.<br/>
Reenie is short for Maureen, but I am definitely not a Maureen.<br/>

When Dylan was little and watched &quot;Once Upon a Forest&quot; - is that the one<br/>
with the toxic spill? - Anyway he&#39;d pretend he was a sick little forest<br/>
creature and make me sing that song to him and &quot;hold his paw.&quot;  &lt;g&gt;  I<br/>
thought it was fun.<br/>

(sp) stomach. If someone restricted my Pepsi drinking to only when I&#39;m sick,<br/>
I would &quot;manipulate&quot; to get some also!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Remember the &quot;New Coke&quot; debacle?  I wasn&#39;t a big Coke drinker when they<br/>
tried the new recipe, but I always relied on Coke and Ritz Crackers when I<br/>
had a migraine.  I was horrified they changed my medication like that, and<br/>
relieved when they saw the error of their ways and brought back &quot;Coke<br/>
Classic.&quot;  Was it a colossal mistake, or the cleverest marketing ploy in<br/>
history???  (I vote mistake; I&#39;ve met marketing people!)<br/>
