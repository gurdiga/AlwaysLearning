<div id="ygrps-yiv-1395672885">Hello all,<br/>
 I am posting this to two different lists because I know that not all the same people are on both lists....but I also know that a few are.  Sorry to those that are seeing this more than once.<br/>
<br/>
My 4 yo boy has, within the last month or so, become VERY interested in how things are spelled and writing them out.  My question is about him making the letters &quot;properly.&quot;  Let me explain the situation:<br/>
<br/>
 Today he says &quot;Mom, how do you spell &#39;love mom&#39;?&quot;  So I say  the name of each letter and he writes it.  If he is not sure of the shape of the letter, I show it to him and he copies it.  As I am watching him do this over the last month I know that he is not making the letters properly (and I really hate to use that term, but don&#39;t know how else to explain it.)  The end result is a shape that looks like the letter it is supposed to represent, but the steps to get there are different.  For example:  a letter V is made with both sides coming up from the bottom, an O is made from the bottom and curving around to the right.<br/>
<br/>
I have not tried to correct him or instruct him at all.  I don&#39;t want to make it difficult and frustrating for him and I realize he is only 4.  My question I guess is really when should I?  I know that making the shapes in a certain way is what helps penmanship to flow.  Could I gently model this for him some how?  If I let it go too long is it going to be more difficult as he gets older?<br/>
<br/>
It may seem silly that I am asking this about my 4 yo when I have a 7 yo, but my approach to penmanship was much different with my 7yo and I don&#39;t wish to repeat those mistakes.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much!<br/>
Jen  :o)<br/>

letter and they don&#39;t involve the very same strokes!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d just let it go. He&#39;ll figure out better ways as time goes on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2110162947">My 8yo makes a lot of her letters completely opposite of the way I do it.. She&#39;s comfortable with it, so I don&#39;t see any reason to have her change it.  I feel that maybe it would be harmful for me to tell her she isn&#39;t doing it right, when actually, it IS right for her.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Jen and everyone else...<br/>
<br/>
I am way behind in posts so if someone else already said this, sorry. I would <br/>
leave it alone. Even if he never writes his letters &quot;properly&quot;, as long as <br/>
they are legible, does it matter? I was a kid obsessed with penmenship, but it <br/>
was also an actual subject that was graded on my report card. But I always <br/>
loved Caligraphy. My dad started buying me sets when I was maybe 7 and I struggled <br/>
to teach myself Caligraphic letters as opposed to standard cursive. All in <br/>
all, I write very uniquely now, at least that is what people say...but some of <br/>
my letters (while writing cursive) I intentionally write in the reverse. Such <br/>
as an &quot;R&quot;, my signature is very odd in that I write my &quot;R&quot; beginning at the end <br/>
and work backwards. But I do know this, I have yet to meet anyone who can <br/>
even come close copying it. I write several letters this way just because for me, <br/>
they flow more naturally. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck and remember this, he probably already writes more legibly than <br/>
most physicians!!!<br/>
<br/>
XOXOXO<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not unless he asks.  My son makes all his letters in non-standard ways.  When <br/>
he first started writing his name, Will, it looked like this.  | | | | i | |  <br/>
  All of those lines were started at the bottom.  Now he makes regular w&#39;s, <br/>
but he still draws his o&#39;s from  the wrong direction (wrong for perfect <br/>
penmanship).  <br/>
<br/>
There were a couple of times when someone wouldn&#39;t recognize what he wrote, <br/>
and he realized it was because they didn&#39;t understand the letters.  So he took <br/>
to asking me if &quot;they&quot; would know that was a G or whatever.  I would always <br/>
tell the truth.  <br/>
<br/>
His handwriting is still not neat or tidy.  He holds his pencil with all four <br/>
fingers on it in a row, thumb below.  We&#39;ve talked about that a little, but <br/>
he doesn&#39;t care.  He thinks he invented that way to hold a pencil--it&#39;s &quot;his&quot; <br/>
way.  I think it&#39;s okay that he doesn&#39;t just roll over when someone says <br/>
&quot;you&#39;re doing it wrong&quot;.  (which I don&#39;t say!)<br/>
<br/>
I think the whole point is that if what he is writing is understood, then he <br/>
did it right.  Penmanship is not the goal.  Communication is.<br/>

doesn&#39;t matter much.  If you tried to write from bottom to top with a quill<br/>
or metal ink nib, you&#39;d spatter ink up your paper.  With an italic<br/>
calligraphy pen, the nib is flattened so downward strokes are thicker than<br/>
horizontal ones; o&#39;s have to be drawn in two strokes, which most people<br/>
don&#39;t do with modern pens.<br/>
<br/>
Both my dh and son start at the bottom and circle clockwise - is it genetic?<br/>
:-)<br/>

writes this way and my mom was always concerned about how we held our pen or <br/>
pencil according to penmanship tecniques. Oddly, my sister holds everything the <br/>
&quot;right&quot; way and has horrible, sometimes barely legible writing and I who, &quot;does <br/>
it my way&quot; have had people ask me to write invitations for their weddings. Not <br/>
tootin my horn ;-), just making the point that the right way should be <br/>
whatever makes it easy to the writer and even better when it looks good.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Will switches hands for lots of things.  The most obvious area is <br/>
baseball--bats left, throws right.  He writes with his right hand, but eats with his <br/>
left.  Casts a fishing rod with his right, swings a golf club left.<br/>
<br/>
He started swinging a bat at less-than-2, lefty, and I always thought he <br/>
would switch some day, and settle on one side or the other.  He never has.  He&#39;ll <br/>
be 10 in November.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not like he can do anything with either hand.  He has specific tasks <br/>
that he does with specific hands. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s considered ambidextrous, <br/>
but sometimes I have to tell his coaches that he is ambi or they try to force <br/>
him one way or the other. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1409838482">Thanks to all that responded to this.  I think I was having a temporary insanity moment of panic and doubt.  I&#39;m saving all the replies I got....just in case I panic again.  And as far as me saying &quot;I know the letters need to be made a certain way&quot;...well...I guess I don&#39;t know.  Must have been some left over school tape playing in my head.<br/>
