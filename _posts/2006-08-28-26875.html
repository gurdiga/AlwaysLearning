Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
Recently my 8 year old has become curious about alcohol.  It&#39;s never<br/>
been a big deal in our family.  My husband and I have an occasional beer<br/>
or glass of wine.  Our children have never seen us (or anyone else for<br/>
that matter) intoxicated.  But he&#39;s discovered that he loves the smell<br/>
of beer.  The other night he was enjoying the smell of my beer and I<br/>
asked if he wanted a taste.  I assumed that he&#39;d think it was yucky.<br/>
Surprisingly he really liked the taste too.  We&#39;ve talked about how it<br/>
isn&#39;t good for his growing body and that there are laws about not<br/>
drinking under 21, but I&#39;ve done it very casually without a fearful<br/>
tone.  He accepts that it&#39;s an &quot;adult&quot; drink and doesn&#39;t really want to<br/>
drink it now.  But he has said a couple of times that when he grows up<br/>
he will be able to drink beer.  I don&#39;t want it to become something that<br/>
he can hardly wait to do.  And yet my family of origin has a propensity<br/>
for alcoholism so I don&#39;t want to be TOO casual about it either.  It&#39;s<br/>
funny because he says similar things about Teen rated video games and R<br/>
rated movies.  He knows he can try them if he wants to, but has set his<br/>
own limits and has said he&#39;s not ready to view them.  I guess it feels<br/>
different because he is setting his own limits on the video games where<br/>
as the State has actually imposed limits on alcohol use.  Of course I<br/>
think there are legal age limits on X-Rated videos as well, but he<br/>
doesn&#39;t know about that yet!  LOL<br/>
<br/>
We practice radical unschooling and don&#39;t have limits on food, sleep,<br/>
TV, or other areas of our lives.  I&#39;m thinking now that I shouldn&#39;t have<br/>
told him about the drinking laws so that I wouldn&#39;t have set alcohol up<br/>
as the &quot;forbidden fruit.&quot;   But before I stick my foot in my mouth<br/>
further, I&#39;d love to hear how you all have approached this subject with<br/>
your children.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2104227872">Hey Sunday!<br/>
<br/>
Had some thoughts about this...<br/>
<br/>
Since the reality is that there is a law about the age one can drink alcohol<br/>
legally, I don&#39;t see any harm in sharing that information.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time you can give him information about &quot;why&quot; there is this law.<br/>
You can give historical information and what your thoughts are about it.<br/>
Giving factual information about what happens to the body with alcohol would<br/>
be helpful to him I imagine.<br/>
<br/>
As far as addiction goes, you can talk about the addiction in your family,<br/>
and how people made choices with alcohol and what some of the consequences<br/>
were/are. Not all at once, but over time when it fits. And not from a<br/>
fear-base of course, but with the same trusting attitude you carry when<br/>
discussing other topics as well.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like maybe this particular subject feels scary because of your<br/>
family&#39;s history...maybe you&#39;re worried about a genetic link? Even if there<br/>
is such a thing with your guy, the best thing he could get is information<br/>
within a rich unschooling life. I imagine the incidence of addiction is<br/>
much, much lower for people who had free and respected childhoods with<br/>
healthy family relationships. Which your guys are very blessed to have with<br/>
you :o)<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have much alcohol here cuz dh and I don&#39;t like much that way, but<br/>
when we&#39;ve had beer or wine at dinner or at get-togethers, we&#39;ve let our<br/>
kids try whatever was out. They usually didn&#39;t like the taste and didn&#39;t<br/>
seek it out again. Now as teenagers, they may be a little more interested,<br/>
but they don&#39;t seem to have an interest in &quot;getting drunk&quot;, though they&#39;ve<br/>
seen it many times on tv or movies, and have been in a couple of different<br/>
situations where other kids were drinking. Of course seeing someone wasted<br/>
is pretty good incentive to NOT want to do it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-645041681">Seamus (almost 10) has been curious about alcohol recently, in <br/>
particular about how it feels to be drunk. I grew up in a home <br/>
without any alcohol (not even beer)as my father was a recovering <br/>
alcoholic. A couple of my brothers are alcoholic (one can go months <br/>
or years without slipping, the other is a drink-every-day-until-you-<br/>
die alcoholic.)<br/>
<br/>
What i did was share my experiences with alcohol with my son, <br/>
openly. My sister also did that, just told him stories, mostly about <br/>
times of getting too drunk and making bad choices. I make sure he <br/>
knows that drinking in moderation is ok, drinking then driving never <br/>
ok, and that since he has genes that are more prone to alcoholism <br/>
(one grandparent out of four, neither parents, not too bad but ya <br/>
never know)he needs to be careful. My son is very into experiences, <br/>
in learning everything he can about life, and sometimes he thinks he <br/>
is more grown up than he is. So i think alcohol is something he <br/>
thinks he can handle. I&#39;m uncomfortable letting him drink the <br/>
alcohol we have in the house (most of it is sweet stuff, like arbor <br/>
mist or mike&#39;s hard lemonade)although i did let him try a sip of the <br/>
remnants of my margarita after the ice had melted in the bottom. <br/>
<br/>
When he went to his dad&#39;s he had some guinness, i wasnt too happy <br/>
about his father making a decision to give him alcohol without <br/>
consulting me, and although i don&#39;t think he truly liked the taste <br/>
he said he did. I really think he does equate drinking with a grown <br/>
up thing to do, which i guess it is given the restrictions in our <br/>
culture. If we were a family that regularly drank wine with dinner <br/>
or something, i think i would let him try it. <br/>
<br/>
Mostly i try to give him factual info about how alcohol lowers <br/>
inhibitions, which can sometimes be a good thing, and is often not <br/>
such a good thing. That it makes you less in control of yourself if <br/>
you drink enough of it, that different types of alcohol have <br/>
different effects (wine vs liquor for example)and that how much you <br/>
weigh, or how well you tolerate it can effect how much you can drink <br/>
before getting drunk. <br/>
<br/>
He went through a period where we were talking about drugs and <br/>
alcohol alot, he was very curious. He hasnt brought it up in quite <br/>
awhile, but he knows that the lines of communication are open. If i <br/>
found out he was drinking as a teenager, i wouldnt freak out or <br/>
anything, and he knows that. My big thing would be to call if you <br/>
need a ride, *thats* the one main thing i would stress. Seems to me <br/>
that the kids who aren&#39;t afraid of their parents flipping out are <br/>
the ones more likely to call for a ride, which is the most important <br/>
thing i think. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1811652652">In the UK the law is that you can give your children alcohol from the age of 5. And while a pub cannot serve your child alcohol, you, the parent, can order a drink for them after they are a certain age (the thought at the minute with David and his brother in the house is that its 12 or 14).  In the U.S., I&#39;m certain, you can serve alcohol to your children when they are underage. And trying to find the laws on-line I found this article:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.jointogether.org/news/research/summaries/2006/teaching-responsible-drinking.html">http://www.jointogether.org/news/research/summaries/2006/teaching-responsible-drinking.html</a> which has this end paragraph:<br/>
 <br/>
--College student Jen Sherwin, a child of California winemakers, said she found that kids at school who had grown up in the most restrictive environments tended to get into the most trouble with alcohol. &quot;It was absolutely insane. There was a lot of alcohol poisoning, a lot of kids had to get their stomachs pumped. People would drink 24/7,&quot; she said. &quot;I had other friends up there from Napa Valley who didn&#39;t go overboard either, because we are used to being around wine, and the freedom of being able to drink wasn&#39;t overwhelming to us.&quot;--<br/>
 <br/>
While alcoholism is something to be wary of, it seems that choice still has an important role to play in drinking.<br/>
 <br/>
From a personal perspective, both Simon and Linnaea have had wine and mead and beer and hardish cider in sips usually. Simon likes cider that isn&#39;t very alcoholic (I think 2%) and Linnaea used to like really hoppy beer, but she doesn&#39;t anymore. They like to pretend to be drunk for a laugh. Last night Linnaea and Simon and their cousins were dancing and air guitaring to Black Sabbath and Linnaea was a backup singer who drank alot and turned into a zombie drunk by the third song (Iron Man). There is no history of alcoholism on either David&#39;s or my side of the family, but my family has a fairly Methodist relationship with drink, as little as possible to keep the Lord loving us. Both David and I drink most evenings. He&#39;ll have a beer or a glass of wine and I usually have a glass of wine while I cook, or watch David cooking. We&#39;ve discovered that Norfolk has a tradition of micro-breweries (and have discovered that the Waynforths of olde were brewers in the region) so David will<br/>
 probably start doing a little beer making soon since the supplies are readily available. It is not among the things that keeps me up nights. I am fairly confident that they have no tendency towards alcoholism and that they won&#39;t feel alcohol is something more than a nice accompaniment to dinner.<br/>

I don&#39;t think you were wrong at all for telling your son that he needs to wait til he&#39;s 21. God forbid he drinks as a teen and gets behind the wheel of a car and kills someone, or himself. Then YOU will be responsible because he&#39;s not of legal age. Good for you for telling him the rules about alcohol.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2019505038">Maybe it depends how strong your inhibitions and fears are, but I  <br/>
think this is too mild:<br/>

<br/>
I think you&#39;re less in control of yourself no matter how much mind- <br/>
altering matter you&#39;ve imbibed.  It ranges from one drink to  <br/>
unconscious, but all along the range is &quot;less in control&quot; than  <br/>
without it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-l lowers inhibitions, which can sometimes be a good thing-=-<br/>
<br/>
When would that be a good thing?<br/>
Seriously.<br/>
It can be fun to be tipsy, but is it &quot;a good thing&quot;?<br/>
Especially for parents, having had the experiences I have, especially  <br/>
if both parents are drinking at the same time (which happened with us  <br/>
only very occasionally--out to dance, which maybe happened once or  <br/>
twice a year, and less as years went on, or a VERY occasional music  <br/>
party with drinking, where they weren&#39;t going out anymore that  <br/>
evening, and I only remember two of those).<br/>
<br/>
Probably my morning perspective is affected by the fact that I&#39;m  <br/>
going to the funeral of the mom of some friends I grew up with.  She  <br/>
was always absolutely nice to me, nice to everyone as far as I know.   <br/>
She was funny and interested in me and asked me REAL questions about  <br/>
real me.  If I asked her questions about when she was little in  <br/>
Truchas (a little town in northern New Mexico) she gave answers she  <br/>
knew would interest me.  She was great.  Bertha Martinez.  She had a  <br/>
brother who was a priest (monsignor at San Juan Pueblo for a long  <br/>
time) and two sisters who were nuns (one&#39;s still living) and had lots  <br/>
of great local religious art.  She has other siblings hither and yon,  <br/>
with kids, and it will be a big funeral.  I&#39;ll be way in the back,  <br/>
but thinking really sweet thoughts about her.<br/>
<br/>
I think if parents set a good example of their kids, and really talk  <br/>
to them plainly and honestly and directly, and they&#39;re nice to them,  <br/>
things will be better than if any of those factors are missing.<br/>
<br/>
-=-. My big thing would be to call if you<br/>
need a ride, *thats* the one main thing i would stress. Seems to me<br/>
that the kids who aren&#39;t afraid of their parents flipping out are<br/>
the ones more likely to call for a ride, which is the most important<br/>
thing i think. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I tell my kids to call for a ride or spend the night where they are,  <br/>
and come back the next day.  Kirby has done more drinking than the  <br/>
other two, and he has not, as far as I know (and Holly reports  <br/>
things, conversationally, in detail) driven at all, ever, after  <br/>
drinking. All three have been at parties where there was drinking,  <br/>
and usually all three are there.  Holly has had drinks at a party  <br/>
where both of her older brothers were, and friends of theirs who know  <br/>
and like her, and that&#39;s not NEARLY as scary as if she were with  <br/>
relative strangers, or new friends, or was somewhere where we didn&#39;t  <br/>
know the people and didn&#39;t even know she was there.<br/>
<br/>
Often one of the kids in the group will totally abstain, to drive  <br/>
home.  A few times kids met here, went in one van, had a designated  <br/>
driver and it turned out two or three abstained anyway, and then  <br/>
drove that batch of kids back to our house where they all slept.   <br/>
Nobody who drank had any reason to drive.<br/>
<br/>
Curfews and punishments do more harm than the alcohol itself, I  <br/>
think.  Being sneaky (as others mentioned) does more damage.<br/>

<br/>
But there ARE drinking laws.<br/>
How could you justify withholding important information like that?<br/>
It&#39;s good that you told him, but people do choose to break one law or another sometimes.  <br/>
The grass in our back yard is over 6&quot; tall, because it&#39;s going to seed and we WANT it to.  <br/>
We had a non-working vehicle in our yard for years (illegal here) before we found someone <br/>
who wanted to fix it for charity.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it would be good to talk with him about what kinds of laws there are, with which <br/>
purposes.  That can be a casual, ongoing discussion for years.  Talk about prohibition, <br/>
when it was illegal for ANYone.  Talk about other countries having different laws (and <br/>
other states, and other counties in some places).   <br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t talk about that all in one sitting.&lt;g&gt;  But as it casually comes up, why not?  <br/>
That&#39;s part of learning all about the world.  And being able to choose to see that whiskey <br/>
tastes nasty is a whole different kind of learning than seeing pretty liquor commercials and <br/>
thinking it must be something sweet and nutritious. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, why do people drink at all? Sometimes, i suppose its for the <br/>
taste. But often, its to &quot;relax.&quot; If i&#39;m in a group situation, i tend <br/>
to be very shy. If i&#39;ve had a drink, i&#39;m less shy....so *for me* <br/>
that&#39;s a good thing. It allows me to be more social than i am <br/>
otherwise. My inhibitions (about talking, about being myself)are <br/>
lowered. If i consistently got *drunk* all the time, and didnt feel i <br/>
could possibly interact with others without it, it would NOT be a good <br/>
thing. As it is, i rarely drink at all (maybe once a year.) So yes, <br/>
i&#39;ve told my son that a little alcohol CAN make you feel relaxed and <br/>
more easygoing (it can also make you more irritated and less patient), <br/>
but that there are other ways to achieve that without alcohol as well. <br/>
And that relying on any substance to make you feel a certain way can <br/>
create a dependancy (whether chemical or psychological.)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess everyone needs to decide for themselves what is &quot;good&quot;, its <br/>
pretty subjective. But for me, yeah, if something is *fun* its a <br/>
pretty good thing. I have some fond memories of being tipsy, or even <br/>
drunk, and some not so fond memories. Sometimes its fun, sometimes <br/>
not, and sometimes what seems like good fun at the time ends up <br/>
being very not-fun the next morning. I&#39;ve shared alot of this with <br/>
my son. My sister especially shared alot of her so-drunk-she-missed-<br/>
entire-concerts-because-she-was-puking stories from high school. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Especially for parents, having had the experiences I have, <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, yeah, not a good set up, if that means both parents are really <br/>
tipsy/drunk and having to take care of children. But if that means <br/>
both parents are drinking a glass of wine at dinner, I dont think <br/>
its necessarily a big deal. Its not something I do, I only drink <br/>
about once a year if that nowadays. But &quot;parents drinking&quot; brings up <br/>
a lot of bad stuff for people when parents drinking meant kids got <br/>
neglected or abused. My niece, whose father is a serious lifer <br/>
alcoholic and whose parents scream and yell at each other all the <br/>
time, alcohol probably will only mean negative things. My son won&#39;t <br/>
have the same associations.<br/>

&gt;and nutritious. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When i was in high school, a friend stole some liquor from her mom, <br/>
and we drove around thinking we&#39;d drink some of it. I think it was <br/>
whiskey. Oh...my....god....it was terrible! We had no idea. So we <br/>
didnt drink of it, just stowed it in my trunk so she could take it <br/>
back.<br/>
<br/>
A few days later, my dad is working on my car, and finds the <br/>
bottle!!! Yikes. My friend concocted some story to tell my mom about <br/>
how it was a gift for her aunt and she left it in my trunk and she&#39;d <br/>
be sure to come right over and get it. I don&#39;t think my mom bought <br/>
that story, but she acted like she did. She was fond of saying <br/>
things like &quot;I know you&#39;re too smart to be drinking...&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I guess you have to be a cowboy to drink whiskey? &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt; When would that be a good thing?<br/>
&gt; Seriously.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>*****<br/>
   <br/>
  For me it&#39;s more about relaxing, too.  In my late teens and early 20&#39;s I drank a lot, and it did get in the way of my living a healthy life. It did lower my inhibitions in dangerous ways.  And for about 15 yrs I didn&#39;t drink at all -- stopped cold turkey on New year&#39;s 88 (after two years of occasional drinking).  I only started social drinking again in &#39;02.  Now, I usually have a bottle of wine in the fridge and will have a glass or two a week.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I enjoy it because it does help me relax.  I tend to carry all the stress in my muscles and it becomes a cycle of stress causing pain, pain causing more stress.  Often a glass of wine will relax me just enough to take the edge off the intensity.  It lets me stop the obsession that&#39;s always part of stress for me.  It lets me let go of the need to control things I really can&#39;t fix or solve, which is a good thing, so sometimes giving up a bit of control is a good thing.  <br/>
   <br/>
  As to how to deal with it with kids, I think that sometimes it varies from kid to kid.  My oldest son gets high more often than I&#39;d like, but his life at 21 is so much less a mess than mine was at that age, that I&#39;m just relieved.  My worries for him are that he comes from addiction issues on all 4 sides of his family, so I know his risk is greater. One comfort to me is that his solution to the topic of driving high or drunk is that he doesn&#39;t own a car, or have a license, tho he did in the past.  This way, he&#39;s removed for himself the temptation to drive high.  If he gets an urge to go out while high, he has no choice but to walk.  Gotta say, that&#39;s more responsible than most folks I knew at 21. <br/>
   <br/>
  My brother is a life-long alcoholic -- started drinking at 8yo -- he&#39;ll never change.  He drives drunk, screws up his life (and his kids&#39; lives too) but that doesn&#39;t have to be my kids&#39; fate, just because they share some genetic material.  It&#39;s hard to watch, even harder to feel powerless to help him or his kids, but it&#39;s his choice.  It is a choice, because even tho alcholism is a disease, one choses to drink.  I also know the pain that led my brother to start drinking, so I can understand how he got there.  It&#39;s something I&#39;m committed to avoid for my kids - the pain. <br/>
   <br/>
  I do think the genetic risk is a valid concern, but I don&#39;t think anyone becomes an addict/alcoholic without some real dysfunction in his/her life.  Addiction and alcholism are forms of self-medication, efforts to treat pain in a person&#39;s life.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Dh doesn&#39;t drink at all, because he&#39;s allergic to liquor (along with a host of other things, I think it&#39;s really about mold).  Andy has asked to have a drink of wine, but at one sniff he has no desire to drink at all -- not a surprise knowing Andy. Dan loves wine, but only sweet wine, and has no interest in beer. He enjoys sweet drinks -- coolers and the like.  I share with him when he asks, but keep it to a sip or two because he&#39;s little.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I think it&#39;s a mistake to restrict alcohol under age 21 across the board. If my kid are going to get drunk and/or do something stupid, I&#39;d much rather it be while they&#39;re young enough that I can help them with the legal end of things.  Once a person is 21, s/he&#39;s on their own legally and the stakes are getting higher all the time. <br/>
   <br/>
  I think the single best thing dh and I can do to prevent drinking/drug problems for our kids is  to give them as joyous a life as we can, filled with love and beauty.  Kids who know they are loved and can always turn to us when life hurts, are less likely to need to self-medicate.<br/>

 When would that be a good thing?<br/>
 Seriously.<br/>
 It can be fun to be tipsy, but is it &quot;a good thing&quot;?<br/>

 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  When I went to Germany in my junior year abroad, Frau Hayden took us <br/>
every night to a weinstuebe. No one *had* to drink; but it was, in <br/>
fact, encouraged. A bunch of 20 strangers thrown together in a strange <br/>
land. She wanted us to chat among ourselves, get to know each other.<br/>
<br/>
  Even at the time, I thought it was a great idea. I don&#39;t remember <br/>
anyone actually getting blotto, but it did loosen our tongues a lot. <br/>
Half of us were frightened rabbits. The other half just pretended not <br/>
to be! &lt;G&gt; It really helped a lot.<br/>
<br/>
  It also enabled us to be less inhibited with tthe foreign <br/>
language---to waiters and each other. &quot;Noch ein Glas Wein, bitte&quot; <br/>
doesn&#39;t sound too bad after the *first* glass. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Plus it was culturally expected. Most of us were 20, two years above <br/>
the legal age in the US at the time. A few older, a few younger. But in <br/>
Europe, it&#39;s not this weird freaky GOTTA-GET-PLASTERED-EVERY-NIGHT <br/>
phenomenon we have here in the US. It&#39;s no big deal.<br/>
<br/>
 It *was* a good thing.<br/>

&gt; overwhelming to us.&quot;--<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Might be a case of her seeing what she wants to see. She definitely  <br/>
didn&#39;t see my college-age kids who have grown up in a home with no  <br/>
alcohol and who still do not drink and never intend to do so.<br/>
<br/>
My dh and I do not drink or serve any alcohol at our house. We don&#39;t  <br/>
badmouth anybody who does - lots of our family members and close  <br/>
friends drink occasionally and that&#39;s fine with us - but we choose to  <br/>
not have it in our lives at all. Our reason is that we feel that our  <br/>
purpose in life is to be MORE aware, more conscious, more mindful -  <br/>
and alcohol has a known negative impact on the brain -  even in low  <br/>
amounts it causes a reduced ability to concentrate, reduced  <br/>
coordination, slower reflexes, poorer reaction time. We just don&#39;t  <br/>
want to do that to ourselves - not on purpose, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I have two daughters in college who go to lots of parties - they pick  <br/>
and choose which parties to go to based on how much alcohol they  <br/>
think will be involved. ALL parties have alcohol - but some parties  <br/>
seem to be just for the purpose of everybody getting drunk, while  <br/>
other parties will have much less drinking and at least a small group  <br/>
of nondrinkers. My daughters find the &quot;everybody is getting drunk&quot;  <br/>
parties to be very distressing - they don&#39;t like seeing the people  <br/>
they know acting like idiots, doing stupid things, talking with  <br/>
slurred speech, being boorish and obnoxious. So, if they think the  <br/>
drinking is getting people to that point, they leave. Roxana left  <br/>
early from a party just this last Saturday night - she stayed until  <br/>
about 11 and then the drinking had gotten started in earnest and she  <br/>
wasn&#39;t having fun anymore. My kids will not get in the car with a  <br/>
driver who had been drinking - not even after one drink (which is  <br/>
enough to impair driving ability - and this includes just one beer or  <br/>
one glass of wine). So - I&#39;m always on call - and have often picked  <br/>
them up from parties and even picked up their friends who had been  <br/>
drinking and needed rides home.<br/>
<br/>
I always assumed my kids would try drinking and try smoking pot - and  <br/>
Roya has tried them. She drank a couple of big cups full of some kind  <br/>
of whiskey, got sick and threw up. She was VERY embarrassed and that  <br/>
was enough for her. She didn&#39;t like marijuana because she didn&#39;t like  <br/>
feeling out of control. Roxana has tasted some alcohol, but not drunk  <br/>
enough to feel the effects. She may still try it - but she won&#39;t ever  <br/>
do it on a regular basis.<br/>
<br/>
For a few years we hung out with a group of homeschoolers with  <br/>
parents who engaged in lots of social drinking, not sure if they were  <br/>
drinking otherwise. Recently my daughters went to a &quot;reunion&quot; of a  <br/>
bunch of the now-young adults who used to be part of that group - and  <br/>
my girls were suprized to discover that these kids were all into  <br/>
drinking as &quot;what you do&quot; at a party. Mine left pretty early - it  <br/>
just isn&#39;t much fun to be around intoxicated people, unless you&#39;re  <br/>
intoxicated, too.<br/>
<br/>
That makes us a bunch of stick-in-the-muds, I suppose. But that&#39;s  <br/>
okay with me - I have plenty of friends and a happy and joyful life  <br/>
without alcohol. And it has NOT, in fact, turned my kids into idiots  <br/>
who would act like the person described in the paragraph I quoted  <br/>
above. For parents who do drink, I think there is an issue of  <br/>
restricting kids from something that the adults in their families are  <br/>
doing. If my kids wanted to drink alcohol, they&#39;d say so and they  <br/>
could do it - we would support that interest. But they&#39;re not in an  <br/>
environment where alcohol looks enticing to them - they don&#39;t see  <br/>
their parents drinking and having fun with it, while they&#39;re deprived  <br/>
and told they have to wait. And they&#39;ve seen how drinking adults get  <br/>
overly loud and kind of obnoxious in various ways - so they don&#39;t  <br/>
want that for themselves. They know why people drink - that it is fun  <br/>
and loosens up inhibitions and so on. But they&#39;re also pretty clear  <br/>
that it doesn&#39;t seem worth it, to them.<br/>

people like this young woman from California is referring to when she speaks <br/>
of children who grow up to consume alcohol because &quot;they can&quot;.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think this is what she is referring to, and you showed the point <br/>
beautifully.  These parents drank recreationally quite a bit.  The kids were <br/>
shown &quot;it&#39;s fun&quot; and also shown &quot;only us adults get to do it&quot;.  That left <br/>
them waiting till the could get away with it (so to speak) and they did it a <br/>
lot.  If children are shown it&#39;s a normal part of life, you can choose to do <br/>
it or not, but if you do, like anything else it should not be done in excess; <br/>
then they handle it more appropriately (in general, there are always <br/>
exceptions). <br/>
<br/>
My parents rarely drank (maybe on New Year&#39;s eve) and always told me if I was <br/>
planning to try drinking it should be done at home where I was supervised and <br/>
not with my friends (who knows what&#39;s being served, who would be trying to <br/>
drive, etc).  I felt respected and since I knew I could if I wanted to I <br/>
never felt an urge.  When I turned 21 I had a few nights where I had white <br/>
wine at dinner or something, but never partied or drank heavily and within 6 <br/>
months I made the choice to start a family and have been &quot;unable&quot; to drink <br/>
alcohol since then.  I don&#39;t miss it and know how to handle it if I am ever <br/>
in a position of choosing to have a drink again.  In my mind it was the ideal <br/>
way of having it presented to me as a child and definitely the way I will <br/>
handle it with my children.<br/>
