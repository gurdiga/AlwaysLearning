<div id="ygrps-yiv-2042811557">Sorry for those who see this several times!  Any other podcast-listeners out<br/>
there?  Why isn&#39;t there a good unschooling one?  People write such<br/>
incredible, beautiful, thoughtful things every day!  Wouldn&#39;t it be great to<br/>
have even just a weekly sampling of the best unschooling<br/>
writings-of-the-week in audio format?<br/>
<br/>
Anyone interested in doing this?  If there&#39;s interest, I&#39;d do it but if<br/>
someone else is working on it I don&#39;t want to steal their thunder.  I am<br/>
aware of the radio Freeschool program and I enjoy it.  But I would like to<br/>
see (hear) something regularly and specifically about unschooling, and not<br/>
from any one or a few experts but from lots of voices!<br/>
<br/>
Anybody else?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
