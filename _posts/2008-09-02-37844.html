<div id="ygrps-yiv-1517812953">Allie (10) and I went out yesterday and had a much needed mom/daughter <br/>
day.  We had a nice long talk about what&#39;s been going on with her <br/>
lately.  Afterwards, she decided public school is probably not the best <br/>
fit for her right now.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re going to try some other things.  She opened up and talked freely <br/>
with me and also listened to suggestions that I had to help her with <br/>
feeling lonely and bored.  She knows I post to this group and I told <br/>
her of the responses and suggestions I got here too.  <br/>
<br/>
Her one major request was to have her own laptop with a webcam so she <br/>
can make some friends online.  She&#39;s been wanting a laptop for quite a <br/>
while now.  I&#39;m thankful I&#39;m working because I now have a way to pay <br/>
for that laptop.  Our finances are not great right now and our debt has <br/>
grown, so my part-time job is a way to buy extra things without guilt.  <br/>
But I&#39;m definitely looking forward to my hours reducing again next <br/>
week.  My working outside the home has affected the family in ways I <br/>
didn&#39;t like.  But it&#39;s been a good experience to work together to meet <br/>
everyone&#39;s needs.  I&#39;ll only be working 3 hours a day soon.  If not <br/>
this week, then definitely next week.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1496265345">That&#39;s great about Allie, and about work hours too.  Glad for you both.<br/>
Thanks for being willing to share all this online too.  It helps so many of<br/>
us see what this process can look like.<br/>

Thanks for updating us about Allie.  I think this is one of the greatest things about <br/>
unschoolers, and that is that we have a flexibility which allows our children to make <br/>
choices--maybe they work, maybe they don&#39;t, but they choose something and get to move <br/>
forward on their decisions.  How empowering!!<br/>
<br/>
This teaches them something very important, I think.  I think it teaches them that it is ok <br/>
to jump---to try something they aren&#39;t totally sure about, and it is equally ok to then say <br/>
&quot;hey, this isn&#39;t for me&quot; and be able to move ON toward something better.  And usually it is <br/>
the experience that creates a bridge they maybe couldn&#39;t see before.  It sometimes gives <br/>
them that knowledge about THEMSELVES that they needed in order to grow.<br/>
<br/>
It is hard as a parent to let your kids make big decisions (like attending school!) if you <br/>
don&#39;t necessarily see the good of it.  I have learned that good comes from every <br/>
experience.  Growth--self-knowledge, mended relationships, boosted self-esteem, <br/>
awareness.....<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with Allie and her new found self!<br/>
