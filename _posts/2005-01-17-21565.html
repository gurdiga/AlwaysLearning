-=-I  have long felt the objections to TV came from public schools and<br/>
teachers,  born out of fear that the ever increasing amounts of<br/>
interesting  information will make schools and teachers  obsolete. -=-<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
GOOD thought!<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve had others, not that good, but parallel.<br/>
 <br/>
Teachers claim &quot;short attention span&quot; and blame TV.<br/>
It&#39;s just that teachers are boring.  They would like to think saying  &quot;Pay <br/>
attention now, this will be on the test&quot; will make them less boring, but it  <br/>
doesn&#39;t.<br/>
 <br/>
If kids are excited about what they saw on TV and are talking about it,  <br/>
that&#39;s disruptive at school.  Had they all done nothing but go home and do  <br/>
homework and go to bed, and not had any interesting life whatsoever to discuss,  <br/>
discipline at school (the teachers fantasize) would be easier.  And the  teachers <br/>
would be more interesting, if the only other things kids did were  homework <br/>
and eat and sleep.<br/>
 <br/>
-=- My<br/>
friend Ellen gets a note about once a month from her daughter&#39;s  fourth<br/>
grade teacher reminding her to limit Anna&#39;s TV and Internet  time.   Quite<br/>
amazing. -=-<br/>
 <br/>
A form letter or an Anna-specific note?  <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s a typed thing, with a space for a kid name to be written in by hand<br/>
so maybe all the parents get it.  Or maybe some get it when the teacher<br/>
thinks she sees evidence of a short attention span. <br/>
<br/>
I wonder if any teachers mentioned the images of Titan they&#39;ve been<br/>
showing on the news and whether it&#39;d be ok for kids to look at those?  <br/>
<br/>
My fifth grade teacher used to assign TV watching, mostly news, but<br/>
sometimes other stuff.   He liked hearing about what we&#39;d watched.  I<br/>
remember on Monday mornings he&#39;s ask what we&#39;d done over the weekend and<br/>
then he&#39;s ask, &quot;Anybody see anything good on TV?&quot;  and we&#39;d talk about<br/>
whatever it was.    <br/>
<br/>
He also smoked his pen and when he was frustrated he&#39;d tell us one day<br/>
he&#39;d marry a nice, beautiful blond lady and forget all about noisy fifth<br/>
graders. &lt;g&gt;   Kind of a nut.  But I remember him as the only teacher I<br/>
really liked.    Rory Jakes. <br/>

Fry: &quot;Yeah, give a little credit to our public schools.&quot; <br/>
