<div id="ygrps-yiv-1136206912">I&#39;ll be hearing John Taylor Gatto speak soon, so I thought I&#39;d order one of his books. I also noticed that you recommend John Holt on this site. At the moment, I&#39;m only looking to buy two books, most likely one by each author. Eventually I&#39;ll read more, but I&#39;m having a hard time deciding which two to start with and wondered if anyone has any recommendations?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also wondering if Gatto is someone who you would also recommend reading, or if you generally prefer Holt? (I must admit that until a few minutes ago, I actually was thinking Gatto was the same person you recommended on this site. I hadn&#39;t realized they were two different people until I was browsing on Amazon.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-428200200">Gatto&#39;s book &quot;The Underground History......&quot; is available for free to read<br/>
on his website. As I understand it there are some valid criticisms about the<br/>
regional nature of the historical information which he presents as all<br/>
encompassing. It is definitely in the realm of school criticism rather than<br/>
being about unschooling. You might also like his shorter talk on the secret<br/>
lessons of schooling. I kinda enjoy it as a guilty pleasure confirming my<br/>
own anti-school bias.<br/>
<br/>
My personal Holt favorites are those I read first - the bookend pair &quot;How<br/>
Children Learn&quot; and &quot;How Children Fail&quot;. Others will have different<br/>
preferences. Get the most recent editions published while he lived - he<br/>
added footnotes and sometime detailed how he had changed his mind about some<br/>
things.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-722161588">I&#39;m simultaneously reading three of Gatto&#39;s books right now...doing some research for a proposed charter school...if I had to choose one to get a good overview of who Gatto is and what he is about, I&#39;d choose &quot;A Different Kind of Teacher&quot;...perhaps his newest would be an option too, but I haven&#39;t read enough of it to confidantly recommend it yet (&quot;Weapons of Mass Insruction). In general, I do recommend reading Gatto. I have been left with a lot to ponder after reading him that influences how I think about &quot;education&quot; and what it means to be &quot;an educated person&quot;. Hope this helps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-802421577">Gatto has a compelling argument against public school.  John Holt says more about how kids learn or don&#39;t learn, in school and how that looks.  Holt is the one who coined the term &quot;unschooling&quot;.  Gatto has little to do with unschooling.  If it were me choosing between those 2 authors, I&#39;d choose Holt.  Gatto&#39;s writing can be read online.<br/>

And the back issues of Growing Without Schooling are on the  <br/>
unschooling.com site (some?  all?), and I added that to my new  <br/>
unschooling search  box, so when searching for things unschoolers have  <br/>
written in the past few years, you  might also get the option to read  <br/>
some of what was in GWS in the late 70s and 1980&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
I just got a note on my own book:<br/>
<br/>
Hi Sandra!<br/>
I have been enjoying your book. I usually read it when I am nursing my  <br/>
little girl (Anna- she&#39;s 2) to sleep. Tonight she took the book from  <br/>
me and wouldn&#39;t give it back. She kept finding all the pictures of  <br/>
your children as babies. She pointed to the picture of Holly as a  <br/>
newborn and sad hold her...mine! I want that! Then she said (about the  <br/>
book), &quot;Read it! Read it! &quot;So for fifteen minutes we &quot;read&quot; your book  <br/>
and she savored all the baby pictures. On the picture w/ Marty and  <br/>
Holly in the sandbox she pointed to Marty and said, &quot;That&#39;s the kid.&quot;  <br/>
Then she pointed to Holly and said &quot;Kid loves baby.&quot;<br/>
Just thought you would be happy to know that your book pleases all age  <br/>
groups!!!<br/>
-Eileen<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1113076012">Thanks for the link, but I&#39;m going on a road trip, so I&#39;m looking to pick up a &quot;hard copy&quot; book (as opposed to online reading). I also seem to find more time and enjoyment reading in bed and away from home, rather than in front of the computer. <br/>
<br/>
Is there any particular Holt title you&#39;d recommend starting with, Sandra? Someone else mentioned How Children Learn and How Children Fail. Those sound interesting. I&#39;m just wondering if you&#39;d suggest starting with one of those or if you have anything else to add.<br/>

If you order it from me it will arrive more quickly than if you order  <br/>
from Lulu or Amazon.<br/>
<br/>
John Holt was one of my favorite writers when there wasn&#39;t anything  <br/>
else to read, but he never had children, so his knowledge was more  <br/>
about school and the joy of the possibility of getting away from it  <br/>
than about unschooling.  Even in Teach Your Own, Never Too Late and  <br/>
Learning all the Time (all of which I read +/- 18 years ago, the ideas  <br/>
are not as solid as what you can get on this list or my site or Joyce&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
As to which Holt books, they&#39;re not always readily available, and it  <br/>
depends what you want.  Do you want to be persuaded that school is a  <br/>
bad idea?  Do you want to be assured that people can unschool?  Last  <br/>
Holt knew, some were trying it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you want one book that will help you move from where you are to  <br/>
unschooling, I recommend The Big Book of Unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
For Holt books, I&#39;d check the link on my holt page, or see what&#39;s  <br/>
available used on Amazon.<br/>

&quot;something else but school&quot; plus both of the above John Holt books  <br/>
when I was exploring that &quot;something else&quot;. But that was all that was  <br/>
available to me at the time.<br/>
<br/>
My understanding of unschooling didn&#39;t blossom until I read at  <br/>
Sandra&#39;s and Joyce&#39;s sites, not to mention the unschooling discussion  <br/>
lists.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to recommend Sandra&#39;s book from the get-go. Nothing (other  <br/>
than the aforementioned sites and lists) will help you better  <br/>
understand what unschooling can be.<br/>
