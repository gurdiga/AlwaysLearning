<div id="ygrps-yiv-1701599480">I&#39;m at a good finished-preliminary stage and thought I&#39;d run the table  <br/>
of contents by people here.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t want to look, that&#39;s fine.  If you do look, maybe scan to  <br/>
see if your favorite topic looks to be there.  It turned out to be too  <br/>
big a job to summarize every page, but I could slip a few more in if  <br/>
I&#39;ve left out something important.   (DOH.  It lost its formatting so  <br/>
you can&#39;t tell major topics from sub-topics; sorry.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1546914941">Looks good.<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought I had while looking at your table of contents:  for years I<br/>
resisted the label unschooler.  I liked calling it experience based<br/>
learning, child led learning, enquiry based learning, natural<br/>
learning,...after all &quot;unschooling&quot; sounded like it had its own curriculum<br/>
or expectations!  Certainly, lots of perscription around it and lots of<br/>
ideas of what freedom, joy, love and family look like.<br/>
<br/>
I also didn&#39;t call myself a vegetarian, I just told people I don&#39;t eat<br/>
meat.  It occurs to me I begrudgingly accept labels and I wonder if most<br/>
people do.  I don&#39;t know if this is something you explore in the chapters<br/>
and it isn&#39;t a well-developed notion, but as long as you are writing a book<br/>
I thought I&#39;d through it out there :)  Mainly because I suppose once one<br/>
accepts a label expectations come with it and it is much easier on a case by<br/>
case basis to be an individual and make your own decisions rather than be in<br/>
a compartment of sorts.  Anyway in all my readings this always sits in the<br/>
back of my mind.  In La Leche League there was always the disclaimer, &quot;Take<br/>
what you want and leave the rest&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t know if this is helpful feedback or not,<br/>

some niggling doubts.  I just notice how people love &quot;orthodoxy&quot; and seem to<br/>
try to put square pegs in round holes.  This has something to do with the<br/>
flurry of NVC discussions, the safety v. freedom (freedom from injury or to<br/>
keep exploring?) and you know...recently we have all engaged in.<br/>

Well, I don&#39;t accept labels, or perscription--which is why any system that<br/>
demands I adhere to it as &quot;gospel truth&quot; makes me run.  The first few<br/>

some sort of &#39;tough love&quot; in action or something other than stemming from<br/>
attachment parenting.<br/>

What you think about all of the recent discussion--is it just that people<br/>
accept one definition of freedom as absolute or just misunderstand<br/>
parameters around parenting or is it me trying to define things that are<br/>
blurry/etheral.   Really I take life case by case...so I find when people<br/>

this in her book, either in the area that tells what unschooling is, or<br/>

<br/>
I imagine that there are folks that come to unschooling expecting there<br/>
to be rules, not unlike using a curriculum.  Not everyone does though! <br/>
It does illuminate our own thinking when we come at something from a<br/>
certain angle and realize that we have to get to the other side of the<br/>
sphere that didn&#39;t even have an angle to begin with.<br/>

Around the world, people use different phrasing for homeschooling and<br/>

to unschooling through a huge disenchantment of the public school system<br/>

lot of thought shifting in regards to my utter dislike of school, since<br/>
it&#39;s way better to run towards something amazing than away from<br/>
something yucky!  There are lots of people who do come to usnchooling<br/>

<br/>
There are a list of things that can help unschooling, but they aren&#39;t unschooling.  You can follow the whole list and be closer to unschooling, but not actually doing it.  There is, similarly, a list of things that can move you further/farther (I can never remember which one!) away from unschooling, but they also may not preclude unschooling.  It&#39;s not that there are hard and fast rules--there are principles that can be like a road map to help people find and unschooling relationship.<br/>

<br/>
I feel compelled to add - I only care what people call themselves because it is NEVER a quiet person just going about their own life labeling whatever they do unschooling. (Heck, they&#39;re probably out there, but since they&#39;re quietly going about their lives...)<br/>
<br/>
I care when people tell others they know that unschooling doesn&#39;t work because they tried it for a month and their kids went wild and nobody learned to read. I care when one of the leaders of a local group assures every new member that unschooling doesn&#39;t work because her kids never did a single bit of school work when she unschooled. I care because it&#39;s hard enough to communicate well, to understand each other, when we all agree on what we&#39;re talking about.

 </span></blockquote>Well, we are all on an *unschooling* list--so the assumption is one is<br/>
unschooling.  I imagine anyone advocating Waldorf would draw ire from Sandra<br/>
for hijacking the list &lt;bwg&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
But I if I can draw a parallel with another label I think I can explain<br/>
better.  Once upon a time a vegetarian, self-proclaimed vegan no less, offer<br/>
me corn soup with pork in it.  It was at a Native POW WOW and she didn&#39;t<br/>
seem to see why when I choose to to stop eating meat it was universal--in<br/>
this case she felt she could make acceptations as Natives are an &quot;oppressed<br/>
group&quot; or some vague reasons that to me seemed unconnected to her choice to<br/>
call herself vegan. I assumed she never ate meat because she introduced<br/>
herself as a vegan and that is what that means. We had discussed why I<br/>
wasn&#39;t a vegan--I eventually got the B12 deficiency that vegans are famous<br/>
for getting, unless they take supplements.  I researched the heck out of<br/>
it--looked at cultures with no dairy, but fish, and The Farm where they take<br/>
supplements.  The Pork Eating Vegan offered herself as proof one could be a<br/>
vegan without this B12 thing and since she self-identified I took her at<br/>
face value.  When I saw her eat meat I realized what I&#39;d read applied, as<br/>
you only need eat meat a few times a year to avoid the deficiency.<br/>
<br/>
Its the same thing with me feeling exasperated when someone identifies me as<br/>
an unschooler, specifically offering to bond on this mutual journey, but<br/>
then seems to be undermining it.  I co-own a list with my sil called<br/>
torontoUNSCHOOLINGassociation and there was a lively debate on whether tv<br/>
should be allowed or not.  We don&#39;t moderate the list so it got a bit ugly<br/>
with people throwing NVC around and everything :)<br/>
<br/>
When we were kicking names around for the list my niece suggested Fun<br/>
Outside is Learning (foil).  I liked the idea as a foil is a sword, a a thin<br/>
layer of polished metal placed under a displayed gem, to obscure or confuse<br/>
(a trail or scent) to evade pursuit.  In the end it became an unschooling<br/>
association because otherwise how would people find us?  I started tUNa by<br/>
accident playing with yahoo and within an hour I had a new member--who had<br/>
obviously searched *local unschooling group* and then joined!  I created<br/>
FOIL and disbanded it--obviously nobody did a search on fun learning!<br/>
Labels are a shorthand--but a way to pigeonhole people, too.  I am forever<br/>
drawing ire from conservatives and liberals alike--being accused of being<br/>
some sort of communist by conservatives and a Fascist by liberals.  But<br/>
really they lose by putting themselves into a box, instead of evaluating all<br/>
information as it comes case by case.<br/>
<br/>
For some a label is a trap--like do we let our children risk their lives or<br/>
our lives at the top of the Grand Canyon because we believe in freedom as<br/>
unschoolers.  Relaxed boundaries or different boundaries is not the same as<br/>
no boundaries--expressed respectfully and with compassion.  Life and death<br/>
or serious accident curtails freedom--but the unschoolers who say they are<br/>
taking a break from life learning by forcing their child to learn to read at<br/>
age seven or some arbitrary age are confusing the heck out of me.  So<br/>
normally I don&#39;t self-identify as an unschooler--I say we are doing<br/>
experience based learning or curriculumless learning or child-led learning<br/>
or enquiry based learning loosely based on the Socratic method.  Since<br/>
people don&#39;t know what I am talking about I can quietly keep doing what I am<br/>
doing as their eyes glaze over &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

<br/>
When you said &quot;undermining,&quot; though did you mean undermining your  <br/>
unschooling?  I think people who talk to unschooled kids and say they  <br/>
really should go to school because they&#39;re  missing out on a lot are  <br/>
undermining unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Did you mean undermining the bonding/friendship?<br/>
Or undermine the mutuality of the journey?<br/>
<br/>
I think in the example you gave, they were undermining the peace of  <br/>
your discussion list, and the direction you had hoped it would take.<br/>
<br/>
All the criticism I&#39;ve had over the years never affected my  <br/>
unschooling.  It only affected the peace of my list (or a folder or  <br/>
forum or whatever).  And sometimes the worst firestorms end up  <br/>
creating the most light, for bystanders.<br/>
<br/>

For some people, a label might be a danger, then.  But it won&#39;t be the  <br/>
label&#39;s fault.  It will (I think, if I understand your example) be the  <br/>
fault of the person who believed that becoming an unschooler only  <br/>
involved saying &quot;Okay!  I&#39;ll be an unschooler!  Now what?&quot; and smiling  <br/>
around at their &quot;new friends.&quot;<br/>

Discussing unschooling is a mutual thing, but unschooling is between  <br/>
the parents and the children.  The discussions are intended to help  <br/>
people figure out how to unschool, at home when nobody&#39;s looking.  And  <br/>
in with that, they should be figuring out on their own whether having  <br/>
their kid in a tree is a good idea.  And there can&#39;t be one rule for  <br/>
all trees at all times.  It should depend on the child&#39;s ability, the  <br/>
ownership and location of the tree, what he&#39;s wearing, what kind of  <br/>
tree it is, whether you need to be somewhere soon, whether it would be  <br/>
a bad idea because younger, more impetuous kids are watching and might  <br/>
follow and be hurt, or stuck up there.  For me, at 5&#39;4&quot; and sometimes  <br/>
pregnant, when my boys were first tree-climbing, sometimes I wanted  <br/>
them to wait until their dad or some other taller, stronger ally was  <br/>
there to help them down if they needed it.<br/>
<br/>
I climbed a spruce tree once in a Brownie uniform.  It was all fine on  <br/>
the way up, but on the way down, the skirt was catching on all those  <br/>
up-pointing twigs so it took a long time to get down and I had a  <br/>
growing audience of people advising me, and looking at my panties.   <br/>
That adds to my checklist of what to consider when a kid asks me  <br/>
whether I mind him climbing a tree.  Rescuing a cat is more noble than  <br/>
going up there to throw sycamore balls at pedestrians.<br/>
<br/>
So the discussions around unschooling are good for helping people  <br/>
figure out how they will live by principles.  Some people don&#39;t want  <br/>
to learn, ironically, so much as they want a sense of belonging and an  <br/>
excuse to reject the old rules they had.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I suppose just creating a misunderstanding about the mutuality of our<br/>
jpurney. I tend to be vague about our &quot;home&quot; based education curriculum<br/>
unless pressed by someone who mentions they are lifelearning/unschooling.<br/>
It is like the vegan example--some people chose a label, whether or not it<br/>
applies.  Maybe I just like clarity in language.<br/>
<br/>
The two big issues are television and food with lots of parents I know. I<br/>
don&#39;t see as much danger in the world.  I think that television and computer<br/>
usage can be beneficial--shielding children in an alternate universe using<br/>
subterfuge irks me.  Ultimately, the message to the child is it is okay to<br/>
lie or restrict communication/honesty.  So I don&#39;t do it-not with my kids,<br/>
nor guests in our home.  I just don&#39;t want to be a party to that kind of<br/>
manipulation. I warn parents if they stay for the playdate they have to<br/>
enforce their own rules.  I encourage my children to consider that a certain<br/>
child has restrictions and that if they want the visits to continue they may<br/>
want to play outside or find a non-computer game to play or watch a dvd that<br/>
child or his/her parent brings over, instead of telelvision.  But it is a<br/>
choice.<br/>
<br/>
I will serve snacks according to the parent&#39;s preference, though because<br/>
that is easier than following kids though my house informing them that I<br/>
will be setting a timer to enforce their half hour limit on the wii or<br/>
forcing certain activities on them.<br/>

gain a lot from discussion, so I assume other people do as well.<br/>

I&#39;ve been on moderated and unmoderated lists.  The frustration or  <br/>
problem of waiting for a post to be approved has never been nearly as  <br/>
bad as the waste of time and irritation caused by bullshit and spam.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve known some people to decide on unmoderated because they kind of  <br/>
liked drama and interpersonal strife, or because they didn&#39;t seem to  <br/>
have the social discernment God gave a donut.<br/>
<br/>
Some people, as you did, want to prove that humans can be responsible  <br/>
and make decisions that are beneficial to others.   Most people can.   <br/>
It only takes one or two to insist that they have the right to write  <br/>
whatever they want, as often as they want, to ruin the list for others.<br/>
<br/>
I think of it as a party, as a simple analogy.  What do people need to  <br/>
have fun at a party?  &quot;Unlimited liquor&quot; isn&#39;t the answer, except for  <br/>
a few.   &quot;Gourmet food&quot; isn&#39;t the answer, except for a few.   But if  <br/>
the hostess has an idea of what she wants to organized, she should say  <br/>
so.  A clear list description will keep her from getting one guy in a  <br/>
nice suit expecting a sit-down dinner with business associates,  and  <br/>
another guy in a toga with a keg.  Neither of those guys is going to  <br/>
have much fun.  Or maybe one will have selfish fun and the other will  <br/>
feel he wasted his time/money/evening.<br/>
<br/>
If the beliefs of the list owner are kept secret, that seems  <br/>
dishonest.  I wouldn&#39;t want to see my Mormon friends show up at a sex  <br/>
party without knowing in advance.  I saw my alcoholic mom go to the  <br/>
Baptist-side-of-family reunions yearly, as a kid; at least she knew in  <br/>
advance here wouldn&#39;t be a single beer anywhere on the site.<br/>
<br/>
The list description is a kind of contract with those who join.   <br/>
People who want a longterm discussion sometimes don&#39;t last long on  <br/>
unmoderated lists.  I can take &#39;em or leave &#39;em, but often I leave &#39;em  <br/>
after a while.<br/>
