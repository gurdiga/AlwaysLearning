<div id="ygrps-yiv-964852303">We are off on a trip to Ghana (from Australia), where DH comes from, <br/>
leaving on Boxing Day. We got the visas today, in the mail, the last <br/>
step in the whole process of passports, vaccinations, tickets etc, so <br/>
now we can concentrate on being excited!! And Christmas. And <br/>
planning, and packing...<br/>
<br/>
The 4 children, aged between 11 and 4 yo, and myself are staying 5 <br/>
weeks; Stephen (DH) is staying a few weeks longer.<br/>
<br/>
On the way back the kids and I have an 11 hour stopover in <br/>
Johannesburg Airport, from 7am to 6pm. It appears we cannot leave the <br/>
airport during this time -- I&#39;m still checking this for sure.<br/>
<br/>
There is a transit hotel where we can hire a room by the hour, and we <br/>
may do this if we are very tired after the overnight flight from <br/>
Ghana, or just need some down-time. However I suspect it may be <br/>
hideously expensive, and in any case since we then have an 11 hour <br/>
overnight flight back to Australia, we probably want to be as awake <br/>
and active as we can be during the stopover.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll make sure the nintendo DS&#39;s are fully charged, and there is <br/>
apparently an area where we can plug in the laptop (will have to find <br/>
out about the right sort of power plugs!) and access the internet. <br/>
Then of course there will be eating, going to the toilet (always <br/>
exciting in a different country...), checking out all the parts of <br/>
the airport we are allowed into, browsing in the shops and perhaps <br/>
buying the odd thing or two...<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m also compiling a list of things to do to keep us occupied, <br/>
games we can play, small games or items I can pack in my hand luggage <br/>
that will while away the time. Games of cards, little games like rush <br/>
hour etc, lots of paper and pen games. Also things we can do that <br/>
will be physically active, without being too disruptive, such as <br/>
hopscotch, giant&#39;s treasure, charades, perhaps we could set up a bit <br/>
of a treasure or scavenger hunt within a defined area, (ticking off <br/>
the items rather than collecting them, I think!) telling each other <br/>
stories about the people we see, where they come from and what sort <br/>
of lives they lead, talking with other people who are waiting around, <br/>
hopefully finding some other people to play with..<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love ideas to add to the list. The wackier the better -- we might <br/>
need wacky by the time it is 3pm and we are facing a few more hours <br/>
in the airport and then 11 more on the plane and then a two hour <br/>
stopover in Sydney and then another hour flying to Melbourne... Let <br/>
your imagination run wild!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1563579083">Hi Helen,<br/>
<br/>
7am - 6pm stuck in the airport???!! Oh gosh, just the thought of it <br/>
is enough to evoke my migraine LOL!! On our trips back to Malaysia, <br/>
we only stopover for 2 hours or so in Dubai airport, even that is <br/>
too long for DS LOL!! In moments like this, I do think certain <br/>
luxury is a must-for my sanity. I invest in a few new DS games that <br/>
he&#39;s not aware of, so in times of need, I start dishing it out. <br/>
<br/>
It seems like you have lots of great ideas, so i can&#39;t think of <br/>
more. But would like to suggest pacing your day out. <br/>
<br/>
The airport&#39;s are busy with lots of strangers walking by. And to be <br/>
in such environment, you&#39;ll be on guard, watching your kids all the <br/>
time, so I can imagine, being stuck in the same airport, you are <br/>
right about the 3pm moment when you&#39;re tired and out of ideas and <br/>
the kid&#39;s getting cranky. <br/>
<br/>
So perhaps, consider taking that hourly hotel option to start off <br/>
with, for an hour or 2, before commencing what you have already <br/>
planned? This way, you might be lucky enough to start winding down <br/>
at the departure lounge closer to 6pm.  <br/>
<br/>
With the hourly hotel option to start the day off first, you can let <br/>
your defense down and probably catch some much needed rest before <br/>
facing the rest of the day - nothing worse than a cranky mum.  The <br/>
kids can spread out in the room and rest abit or do whatever they <br/>
want, chill before venturing out into the airport. <br/>
<br/>
With meal times in between, you stand less chance of them being <br/>
bored and restless. <br/>
<br/>
All the best. <br/>
<br/>
SharonBugs. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1801918955">I used to travel a lot as a teenager/young adult and frequently had<br/>
long layovers.  I brought lots of music, books and tried to take naps<br/>
whenever I felt tired (I used to be able to fall asleep pretty much in<br/>
any position.)<br/>
<br/>
In airports that have a shower facility (I know the Sydney airport<br/>
does, and you mention the hotel option where you are going to be, so<br/>
there might be a shower there too) I always used to take a loooong<br/>
shower: helps pass the time and helps feel refreshed after a long<br/>
flight and before the next leg of the journey.<br/>
<br/>
Somebody once suggested a new toy/ thing to do for every half hour of<br/>
the journey and that worked pretty well last time we had a long flight<br/>
with dd, who is 3 years old (but it was &quot;only&quot; 8 hours, and no<br/>
stopover :-) <br/>

 if you are planning to hide objects ( that may mot be what you are saying) /i would not do it.&#39;<br/>
someone hiding things in an airport , child or adult, would set up huge red flags!<br/>
Also remeber that you will have to drag all the games, toys stuff around all day unless you get a locker so pack light.<br/>

You can still do a team scavenger hunt sort of thing by finding things<br/>
in the airport, like a blue chair, or a red garbage can, or things of<br/>
that nature.  A little like the alphabet driving game, which we&#39;ve<br/>
always done as a team effort rather than who finished first.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1441802912">Not sure about how it would comply with new airline regs, but we used <br/>
to bring bubbles.  In a quiet corner of the airport, chasing bubbles is <br/>
a nice physical activity.  You could do the same with paper airplanes--<br/>
bring a few designs, fly them and chase them (assuming there *is* a <br/>
quiet corner).<br/>
<br/>
We like flying through certain airports that we know have play areas--<br/>
maybe Johannesburg has one?<br/>
<br/>
We have gotten a lot of mileage out of origami--it&#39;s fun twice, while <br/>
you&#39;re making it and then when you play with it.<br/>
<br/>
I try to make sure ds and I are dressed in bright colors when we <br/>
travel, which makes it easier for us to find each other if we lose <br/>
track for a moment.  I&#39;m not usually a fan of matching clothes for <br/>
siblings, but this might be the day to ask them all to wear orange or <br/>
something!</div>

<br/>
Holly lost a little bear, playing in a play structure in Toronto.    <br/>
She didn&#39;t recover for a long time.  We called security  to ask them  <br/>
to keep it if they found it because we&#39;d be back in a week, and we  <br/>
checked, but it was gone.<br/>
<br/>
So that too, about playing in airports.  Double check possessions.<br/>
<br/>
What about a map, and asking people to put a mark on where they&#39;re  <br/>
from?  It might be a way to strike up conversations with people  <br/>
without them thinking you&#39;re kooks or robbers, if you have the map  <br/>
out and it&#39;s clearly not a solicitation of any kind.<br/>
<br/>
We had a map of the U.S. with us when we went to Mt. Rushmore, and we  <br/>
walked through the parking lot marking states from which there were  <br/>
license plates.  And there were a couple of Canadian provinces, and  <br/>
as we were going back to the car, a camper pulled in.  We ran toward  <br/>
it (must&#39;ve spooked the driver) and when we saw that it was Alaska  <br/>
the kids started whooping and hopping and I marked it on the map.  So  <br/>
I went and showed the man who was driving what the excitement was  <br/>
about and he thought it was great.  There were over 30 states in one  <br/>
smallish parking lot on one day.<br/>
