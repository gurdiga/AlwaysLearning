<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Ok it is done.<br/>
&gt; I got yet another call from the school today. First from the office <br/>
&gt; asking why I allowed both my girls to stay home yesterday and spend <br/>
&gt; the day with me. I informed them that with my work sec. it was the <br/>
&gt; only time I had to see them, and entire family took days off work <br/>
&gt; ext. write them down excused parent or sick  (call it mommy iddess, <br/>
&gt; witch ever I didn&#39;t care)<br/>
&gt;  Then the next was from my Daughter in tears again. We had gotten <br/>
&gt; her hair cut yesterday and the girls where making fun of her writing <br/>
&gt; on the bathroom walls and so forth. Even threatened to kill her again <br/>
&gt; and beat her up, for getting her hair cut.<br/>
&gt; I had had it. Daughter wanted to come home I told them release her <br/>
&gt; they said just because she is being picked on .I told them for get it <br/>
&gt; I will be right there. I met daughter in hall and said you sure you <br/>
&gt; want to do this now she said please mom. We marched into the <br/>
&gt; superintendent&#39;s office asked for the paper work was asked why and I <br/>
&gt; re told them why. They gave me the paper work and we went to the <br/>
&gt; locker and cleaned it out. Turned in the books and said we are done.<br/>
&gt;   So now here is my dilemma on the paper work it says I have to <br/>
&gt; have special permission it reads:<br/>
&gt; No. #8. If the child is currently identified as a child requiring in <br/>
&gt; special education prior approval must be sought from the special <br/>
&gt; education director at the Area Education Agency if this is the first <br/>
&gt; year that the child will be receiving Competent Privet instruction in <br/>
&gt; Iowa. Iowa code section 200A.9<br/>
&gt;  If she had a IEP is she one that needs special permission?<br/>
&gt; I told her she didn&#39;t have to go back. And I will not lie to her. <br/>
&gt; Next Monday is nest day during the day I have off and will make a <br/>
&gt; trip to the homeschool in Kolona and see if I can transfer her there, <br/>
&gt; and bypass it all. But thought I would inform here to progress. And <br/>
&gt; ask for advice.<br/>
&gt; Dee<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Dee, you wonderful, loving Mom!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
She probably IS considered to need special permission. What kind of <br/>
relationship do you have with the SPED people? Maybe it won&#39;t be a big deal. <br/>
If it seems to be, I&#39;d consider going right to the Superintendent. It&#39;s so <br/>
close to the end of the school year it might not even be a problem. <br/>
<br/>
Keep us posted, and let us know if you need help.<br/>
