&lt;&lt; If I say let&#39;s put oatmeal in this soap because it will make it scratchy <br/>
and tell them why we would want scratchy soap, I&#39;ve taken all the discovery <br/>
out of everything.  If I buy all the soap making stuff and say you decide how <br/>
you want to use this, we usually will not have a finished product.  What is <br/>
the best way to help them discover and yet minimize frustration? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You need to want to make soap yourself, or else they need to want to make <br/>
soap themselves, because if you  just want them to make soap, there&#39;s <br/>
frustration all around.<br/>
<br/>
And if you say &quot;Do you want to help me make soap?&quot; they will probably say <br/>
yes.  What they will mean is they want to do something new and fun.  <br/>
Whichever part of helping is NOT new and fun will go on the meter too, so <br/>
they might not make it through the project if you involve them totally too <br/>
soon (like when the stuff&#39;s still in the box).<br/>
<br/>
So like a chef&#39;s helper or the tech-guy who sets up the TV demonstration in <br/>
advance, have things at an organized and interesting place before you call <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
If Holly wants to help me make cookies, I don&#39;t make her find the pans and <br/>
see if there&#39;s vanilla.   She wants to stir, or to measure, to form dough, or <br/>
to put them in the oven.  She doesn&#39;t have a two-hour attention span.<br/>
<br/>
So settle for them being in on the fun parts, and don&#39;t unreasonably expect <br/>
them to either do it all, or to even pay attention to it all.<br/>
<br/>
And if you make some with oatmeal and some without, you could either tell <br/>
them &quot;some people like scratchy soap&quot; or not, and then let them decide on <br/>
their own whether they themselves do or not later on, when the soap&#39;s cured, <br/>
and they try it.<br/>
<br/>
Soap is a little like molding ceramics.  It&#39;s such a long-term project that <br/>
younger kids have forgotten the beginning of it by the finished-project time. <br/>
  So don&#39;t envision one solid experience, but the parts of it.  (Unless this <br/>
is soap that&#39;s ready to use pretty soon and doesn&#39;t need to cure in stages.)<br/>
<br/>
But basically, if you don&#39;t want to do it yourself, don&#39;t even start.  If the <br/>
kit costs money and you&#39;ll be resentful if the kids aren&#39;t thrilled and <br/>
industrious, wait until later, if ever, to do it.<br/>
<br/>
That sounds negative, but in the meantime there are half a million other <br/>
things in the world that they might like better.  Instead of getting them to <br/>
like what you think they will like, playing and goofing around and going for <br/>
walks and discovering what they DO like will make a less frustrating path.<br/>
