-=-If your goal is to chase people away who are considering unschooling,<br/>
then I guess you&#39;re achieving your goal with your attitude.-=-<br/>
<br/>
As it was addressed to me specifically, I read it, I saved it, but I  <br/>
didn&#39;t put it through to the list.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s some reading to make you feel better.  If my goal was to chase  <br/>
people away, this site wouldn&#39;t exist:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschooling">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a><br/>
nor this blog<br/>

A couple of quotes from those pages:<br/>
<br/>
==================================<br/>
-=The hardest thing I&#39;m doing these days is being at peace with my  <br/>
pace of growth, which I think should be instaneous. As was said at a  <br/>
recent unschooling gathering, it&#39;s not a trick of logic so much as a  <br/>
being at one with. There&#39;s a long list of things that are good to be  <br/>
at one with. (That&#39;s an idea right there. Jotting down those things.)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;So to come full circle, unschooling, attachment parenting and other  <br/>
great ideas have led me to feel not that ds is overwhelming me, but  <br/>
enriching my life in countless ways. There it is. I&#39;m growing more  <br/>
gratitude, a muscle that hasn&#39;t seen much use until ds. I am so  <br/>
blessed by a child.-=-<br/>
================<br/>
<br/>
Why Rush People to Get it?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Kinder and gentler would&#39;ve slowed down my learning<br/>
to the point I don&#39;t think we&#39;d have ever gotten here.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Priss wrote that.<br/>
<br/>
When people say &quot;You&#39;re patient with your own children but pushy with  <br/>
unschooling parents,&quot; it&#39;s because of the possibility that they will  <br/>
run out of time.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have their whole lives to memorize 7x8 if they want to.<br/>
<br/>
The mother of a twelve year old has VERY little time if she wants to  <br/>
help him recover from school and spend a few unschooling years with  <br/>
him before he&#39;s grown and gone. She doesn&#39;t have time to ease into it  <br/>
gradually. If she does, he&#39;ll be fifteen or sixteen and it just won&#39;t  <br/>
happen.<br/>
<br/>
If the mother of a five year old is trying to decide how much reading  <br/>
instruction and math drill to continue with before she switches to  <br/>
unschooling, I want to press her to decide it&#39;s &quot;NONE,&quot; because  <br/>
&quot;some&quot; is damaging to the child&#39;s potential to learn it joyfully and  <br/>
discover it on his own. And &quot;lots&quot; will just hurt that much more. But  <br/>
&quot;none&quot; can still be turned to &quot;some&quot; if the parent can&#39;t get  <br/>
unschooling. But if she doesn&#39;t even try unschooling, she misses  <br/>
forever the opportunity to see that child learn to read gradually and  <br/>
naturally. It will be gone forever. Forever.<br/>
<br/>
So I don&#39;t say &quot;Gosh, I&#39;m sure whatever you&#39;re doing is fine, and if  <br/>
you want to unschool you can come to it gradually at your own rate.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
People say jokingly (though it&#39;s true) &quot;I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll be reading by  <br/>
the time he goes on a date&quot; but that can&#39;t be said of unschooling, if  <br/>
the parent is attached to thinking she needs to teach things.<br/>
<br/>
Until a person stops doing the things that keep unschooling from  <br/>
working, unschooling can&#39;t begin to work.<br/>
<br/>
It seems simple to me. If you&#39;re trying to listen for a sound, you  <br/>
have to stop talking and be still.<br/>
<br/>
Some people want to see unschooling while they&#39;re still teaching and  <br/>
putzing and assigning and requiring.<br/>
<br/>
They have to stop that FIRST. And then they have to be still. And  <br/>
then they have to look at their child with new eyes.<br/>
<br/>
If they don&#39;t, it won&#39;t happen.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1544083080">I want to chime in here. <br/>
<br/>
I was on the unschooling.info forum and felt and saw people getting <br/>
offended and assumed it must be what the veterans (and even myself) <br/>
were saying. We weren&#39;t fluffing it up enough. We weren&#39;t easing them <br/>
in. We were turning them off.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, I want to take it all back now and apologize for not <br/>
understanding where you and others were coming from when you tried to <br/>
explain it before. I didn&#39;t get it until I experienced it the other <br/>
way around.<br/>
<br/>
I started a group on MySpace, mainly to attract other unschoolers for <br/>
me to network with but instead turned myself into some kind of advice-<br/>
giver. And then I began to see what everyone was telling me before.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found that many people like the &quot;idea&quot; of unschooling but they <br/>
only want to force the label of unschooling to fit what they have <br/>
been doing all along. They want to be reaffirmed in their current <br/>
actions. It does *not* matter how I or someone else say something. <br/>
The receiver will respond how the receiver wants to respond depending <br/>
on whether or not they are ready for and willing to accept the info <br/>
they are being given. If they only want to desperately hold on to <br/>
their old ideas, they will get offended and they will fight back <br/>
because they feel they are being attacked.<br/>
<br/>
Are they being attacked? Sure. But not by anyone&#39;s advice. Usually by <br/>
their own conscience or in some cases, guilt. They are facing a <br/>
radical idea they don&#39;t truly want to face/accept and are therefore <br/>
fighting against it. The advice-givers become their punching bag, <br/>
simply because they held up a mirror they didn&#39;t really *want* to <br/>
peer into.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s happened to me; both on the receiving end and the giving end. I <br/>
see it happen to so many others. <br/>
<br/>
To paraphrase what Sandra told me, they&#39;ll either get it or they <br/>
won&#39;t. They will either keep coming back or they won&#39;t. But better to <br/>
show them the real deal first, right off the bat so they can decide <br/>
if it&#39;s what they want. Better to not reaffirm what they are doing so <br/>
they don&#39;t feel they should keep doing it or so they don&#39;t just mold <br/>
unschooling to their liking.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s straight-forward, sometimes it almost feels brutal. But when I <br/>
walked away with the &quot;brutal&quot; image I was shown, that image stayed <br/>
with me. Why? Cuz it was *my* image; they just held the mirror. Can I <br/>
blame the mirror for what it reflects? Because someone held that <br/>
mirror I was able to see what I was doing wrong and correct it sooner <br/>
rather than later.<br/>
<br/>
I only have one shot with my kid and I&#39;ve screwed a lot up in the <br/>
past. I want someone to be honest with me where I&#39;m not able to be <br/>
honest with myself. My kid needs me to receive that straight-forward, <br/>
no-messing-around advice you only get from a really good friend - ya <br/>
know, the kind of friend who will tell you &quot;No that skirt looks bad <br/>
on you&quot; (rather than he friend who doesn&#39;t want to hurt your feelings <br/>
so they say nothing)! <br/>
<br/>
*My son* deserves the best mom now, not in 4 years when I look back <br/>
and *then* see how I screwed up. Better me to get offended while <br/>
online than my child to suffer my bad actions later.<br/>
<br/>
So for what it&#39;s worth, Sandra, I get it now and I&#39;m thankful that <br/>
you and Joyce and others showed me that mirror in the past. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I came to Sandra&#39;s circle a long time ago, I was confronted, I was<br/>
challenged *&* I was out-of-this-world determined to seek out that which<br/>
impassioned me so and decide what the deuce to do with it. Because of this<br/>
urgency (call it a kick in the pants or head-from-ass removal)  to shift<br/>
focus to NOW to BE with my kids where they ARE, I had a teeeny tiiiiny list<br/>
of regrets when my daughter, Hannah, died when she was 9.5. (i.e. Puff the<br/>
Magic Dragon didn&#39;t really play &quot;with a girl named Hannah Lea&quot;)<br/>
I&#39;ll never regret having spent those hours, days, maybe even weeks in<br/>
angry-turned-healed tribulation and introspection. They led to far more<br/>
days, weeks, months and YEARS living joyfully in our now... even through my<br/>
grief (we just had the 2 year anniversary of Hannah&#39;s transition and a good<br/>
friend died the next day!) I realize that the true message here is: You (all<br/>
of YOU human beings on the planet!) don&#39;t have time to f*ck around!! NOW is<br/>
all you got and it&#39;s as sacred as you make it. How do you want to spend your<br/>
last moments on this planet? How do you want your kids to spend theirs? That<br/>
is, for me especially, the heart of this lifestyle and my commitment to it.<br/>

That&#39;s probably why so many people treat it like a club we&#39;re trying  <br/>
to keep them from joining instead of a philosophy we&#39;re trying to  <br/>
help them really, truly understand.<br/>
<br/>
The un-forwarded e-mail that inspired me to start this thread also said<br/>
<br/>
-=-Funny, I thought cliques and &quot;mean girls&quot; were just for school.  I  <br/>
guess they&#39;re for unschooling too.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s how to get in &quot;my clique.&quot;  Help other people understand  <br/>
unschooling.  REALLY understand it yourself, so well that you can  <br/>
spend lots of volunteer time illuminating the minor details for  <br/>
others.   There.  The secret is out.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Moms come to a place and see other moms writing &quot;That&#39;s so cool!&quot; to  <br/>
each other and they want someone to say &quot;That&#39;s so cool&quot; to them.   <br/>
Unfortunately, they want it gratis, without sharing or learning or  <br/>
changing.<br/>
