what the take is going to be.  <br/>

This didn&#39;t look altogether promising:<br/>

No school, no books, no teacher&#39;s dirty looks<br/>

It&#39;s a child&#39;s dream. Wake up whenever you want, with nobody telling  <br/>
you what to do and when to do it. And here&#39;s the kicker: No school to  <br/>
rush off to.<br/>

(I got it by having &quot;unschooling&quot; listed on yahoo alerts.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-640576671"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Nailah, who would be in 4th grade if she attended a regular school, seems to enjoy the &quot;unschooled&quot; lifestyle, even if she&#39;s a bit confused when asked what she is learning.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;I actually don&#39;t know what I&#39;m learning,&quot; Nailah said. &quot;I think I&#39;m just having a good time. But I don&#39;t know that I&#39;m learning.&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why do they always seem to end with this sort of comment?  Isn&#39;t it about the same answer you would get from most schooled kids anyway?  Except for the having a good time part...<br/>
<br/>
There was a TV spot this week on a local channel.  They interviewed some local homeschoolers who have a weekly co-op.  I know many of the organizers of the co-op and gagged when I read some of the things they wanted to have, including a study hall where students would NOT be allowed to interact with one another.  Dress code and everything.<br/>
<br/>
I missed the spot when it aired, but was told that they asked a small group of the teens whether they would homeschool their own children.  According to one of the moms, their was a mixed chorus of yes and no, but they chose to focus on the girl who said no.  She said she is shy because she was homeschooled and now it is too late for her to adapt to school.<br/>
<br/>
Bleh!<br/>
