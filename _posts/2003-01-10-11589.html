<br/>
My last visit to the doctor was January 3rd.  He took X-Rays of both my<br/>
wrist and knee and tested my knee for strength.<br/>
<br/>
You can still see a fracture line on the wrist, but I do not need the<br/>
brace anymore.  I still have to be careful about using it and how much I<br/>
lift with it but it is healing up.  I recently discovered that<br/>
anti-inflamatory drugs prevent bone regrowth, so I think the Tylonol I was<br/>
taking may have slowed the mending of my wrist.<br/>
<br/>
My knee has almost completely healed (two torn ligaments.)  He says that<br/>
the healing in my knee is way ahead of schedule.  The X-Rays also don&#39;t<br/>
show any sign of a chip fracture.  So, as he put it, either the original<br/>
X-Rays and ultra sound were flawed or the chip settled back in place and<br/>
healed up.  It looks, to his amazement, that I will not require any<br/>
surgery on my knee and I should make a near full recovery.    He is not<br/>
sure that I will regain full mobility with my knee but I have passed the<br/>
60 degrees of movement that he was hoping to get at a minimum.<br/>
<br/>
I go back in a month (from the 7th) for possibly one last visit.  He is<br/>
pretty sure the knee will be beyond what he can do to help it.  He is more<br/>
concerned about the wrist at this time.<br/>

COOL!<br/>

I hope the other effects of the accident fade too.<br/>

he is sick (rarely) it is never for long and hardly<br/>
ever serious.  It&#39;s irksome to me, who has always had<br/>
a somewhat compromised immune system and spent much of<br/>
my life ill in hospital or convalescing at home. <br/>
However, since leaving my stressful childhood behind,<br/>
eliminating dysfunctional people from my life as much<br/>
as possible, and getting my allergies under control, I<br/>
am much, much healthier.  <br/>
<br/>
This is Tom&#39;s first major injury (injuries) since<br/>
we&#39;ve been married, and he is healing with his typical<br/>
speed.  I was worried that he would have continuing<br/>
problems with the wrist and knee, and have to wear<br/>
braces off and on for maybe a long time, but I think<br/>
we can possibly make him stronger than before.  We are<br/>
planning to start doing Yoga in the mornings for<br/>
health, and hopefully as physical therapy for him as<br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
Even Tom&#39;s lacerations from all the glass healed so<br/>
quickly that we had to cut out several pieces of glass<br/>
that had healed over.  One on his forehead will leave<br/>
a bigger scar, as it required a trip to the doctor and<br/>
stitches to remove it.  It&#39;s hard to imagine how you<br/>
could miss embedded glass like that, but when you are<br/>
looking at a lacerated mess from glass exploding at<br/>
him, it&#39;s hard to see anything, and not a place you<br/>
want to poke around.  Tom has a number of new scars on<br/>
his head and arms, but they are a small price to pay<br/>
for his life.  We are very, very lucky.<br/>
