<br/>
I moved to Florida (Ocala) from NYC in 2002.<br/>
<br/>
There are 2 ways to homeschool in this state. One is through the <br/>
state and one is through a 600/non-public school.<br/>
<br/>
Through the state, you have to submit a yearly portfolio and have <br/>
your child evaluated.<br/>
Through a 600 school, you follow the rules of that school. The only<br/>
procedure a 600 school is required by law to follow is that they<br/>
collect attendence (180 dates). If they have any other rules, those <br/>
are their own rules that they decided on.<br/>
I belong to AEI. Here is the link:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://alternativeeducationinstitute.org/index.htm">http://alternativeeducationinstitute.org/index.htm</a><br/>
The only requirement they have is collecting attendence, which you <br/>
send in through an e-mail. You can pass on the health <br/>
exam/immunization part for religious or moral reasons.<br/>
The woman who runs the school, also runs a very informative yahoo <br/>
group on Florida homeschooling laws. Here is the link:<br/>

Please feel free to contact me if you need more information!<br/>

<br/>
I am in South Florida, Miami to be precise.  What part of Florida are <br/>
you moving to?<br/>
<br/>
If you are moving to South Florida (Dade, Broward or Palm Beach <br/>
county), we have unschooling yahoo! group.  If you would like to join, <br/>
the name of the yahoo! group is RUBROWARD.  There is also an <br/>
unschooling yahoo! group for the whole state of Florida: FLUNSCHOOLING.<br/>
<br/>
Kind regards,<br/>
Anna<br/>
