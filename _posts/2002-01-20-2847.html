<div id="ygrps-yiv-579107581"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; Testosterone &gt; dissolves a noticeable percentage of<br/>
&gt;&gt;those pathways as the fetus obtains its gender.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Now, why, I wonder, would nature remove a feature<br/>
&gt;that&#39;s in place? .....There must be something the<br/>
&gt;brain can do better without the intuitive ability, a<br/>
&gt;trade off, giving up something to get something else.<br/>
&gt;Or something extra males have that the intuitive <br/>
&gt;ability interfered with.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Maybe the intuitive ability enhances the nurturing<br/>
&gt;and the need to be with the group. And by removing<br/>
&gt;it, it allowed men to need to roam beyond the group<br/>
&gt;and do things that weren&#39;t people oriented like<br/>
&gt;building and creating.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Interesting possibility, but here is another<br/>
possibility for you to think about.  I think it more<br/>
likely that this difference has to do with hunting.   <br/>
Traditionally, men are built for hunting, and for<br/>
physically protecting mate and young.  In order to<br/>
facilitate these adreneline fed activities, men are<br/>
given the ability to hyper-focus on them, and tune out<br/>
unrelated surrounding distraction.  Men also have more<br/>
cones than rods in their eyes, cones being what allows<br/>
close focusing.  (Hope I got that right, cones vs<br/>
rods, the principle is correct, men have more focusing<br/>
ability, but I forget which is which cones/rods.)  Men<br/>
had no great need for communicating subtleties either,<br/>
but used direct, brief, needs driven communication. <br/>
<br/>
Women are designed to pick up more sensory information<br/>
and subtle clues in order to be aware of the needs of<br/>
her children around her, and aware of the dangers in<br/>
her environment, and discovering sustenance and<br/>
meeting other basic needs by gathering plantstuffs,<br/>
all at the same time.  Women have more rods than cones<br/>
in their eyes, allowing them more peripheral vision<br/>
and wider and more varied perception.  Women were in<br/>
charge of the home and family and needed greater<br/>
social awareness and sensability to deal with those<br/>
around her, and a more complex communication system<br/>
for dealing with the issues of being social,<br/>
interrelating and interdependent in a child rearing<br/>
situation with others.  <br/>
<br/>
Times have changed and sex roles are not so clear cut<br/>
anymore.  But women are indeed better built for doing<br/>
certain things more easily than men, and the reverse<br/>
is also true.  Which only means some things are more<br/>
challenging for one that seem simple to the other.<br/>
