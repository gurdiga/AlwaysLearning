<div id="ygrps-yiv-1443417681">&lt;&lt;We ended up getting a very nice room at<br/>
the Hyatt, just off the strip for $50.00 a night.<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, I feel the same way. I haven&#39;t been there in such a long time that <br/>
it sounds fun now. I don&#39;t gamble much, but I love getting a deal and <br/>
LV&#39;s the place to do that (if you don&#39;t gamble!).<br/>
<br/>
I dug around online for HOURS and came up with a $46 room right in the <br/>
center of the strip!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-733794380">My kids are spoiled with Vegas.  Mark played at Mandela bay for 9 weeks<br/>
when it first opened, and we went every other weekend for 3-4 days.  It<br/>
was free, his room was included.  It was really cool to stay at that<br/>
hotel, to be the first in the room, etc.  The girls got used to the<br/>
valet parking, the bags being carried to our room, buffets, etc.  We<br/>
also stop in Laughlin every time we go to New Mexico--same thing, cheap<br/>
hotels (Laughlin is really cheap on week days, less than $20 a night,<br/>
usually), buffets, valet parking, etc.  My parents stop in Laughlin on<br/>
the way here  and back and we usually drive to laughlin with them and<br/>
stay the night and then they head on to NM and we come back home.<br/>
Anyway... I recently took the girls to Santa Barbara and Solvang for the<br/>
weekend.  They were really mad that the hotel didn&#39;t have a buffet,<br/>
didn&#39;t have valet parking and, this really got to them--they had to<br/>
carry their own bags to their room.  You&#39;d have thought I was abusing<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
This weekend we are staying 20 miles away at the Hilton in Costa Mesa<br/>
for the LLL Conference.  They were glad to know they wouldn&#39;t have to<br/>
carry their own bags.  Silly children.<br/>

  Las Vegas just looks like a place to toss away large quantites of <br/>
 cash...or is there anything else to do? With small kids? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Now don&#39;t tell me you haven&#39;t seen all those travel channel plugs for Las <br/>
Vegas Shyrley!!! <br/>
We&#39;ve only driven through Vegas without stopping, so I&#39;m certainly no expert. <br/>
But from family and friends that have gone, it&#39;s a really GREAT place to just <br/>
traipse around and be awed by the architecture, something the kids might <br/>
enjoy.<br/>
AND, I&#39;ve been told that many casino&#39;s have thrill rides that rival any theme <br/>
park, and cost less too.<br/>
I&#39;m sure you could blow a lot of cash, but I think it would be a really fun <br/>
place to take kids.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes! We just went and really enjoyed it without even gambling much. (Video<br/>
poker was fun.) Though gambling is where they make they&#39;re money, they&#39;re<br/>
gearing towards tourists. The casinos are much brighter and the air<br/>
circulation is good so you don&#39;t notice the smokers.<br/>
<br/>
Kathryn says she liked the Atlantis show -- I think it&#39;s in Ceasar&#39;s Palace<br/>
and it&#39;s free. (Though there&#39;s a motion ride next to it that&#39;s thematically<br/>
connected but not free.) We didn&#39;t even get to the Star Trek Experience but<br/>
we did eat at Quark&#39;s Bar and did the shops which was fun :-)<br/>
<br/>
The architecture is incredible. Most of the casinos have theme malls with<br/>
more incredible architecture attached to them and some attraction. I&#39;m<br/>
definitely not a big city, night clubby type person but I enjoyed it. Vegas<br/>
is sort of like an amusement park for the eyes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1033680053">My husband and I eloped and got married in Las Vegas!<br/>
Some friends of ours, a couple, went with us to be our witnesses.<br/>
It was the right thing for us to do, we&#39;ve never regretted it.<br/>
It was fun, and we saved our money for the honeymoon.<br/>
We went to St. Thomas and had a wonderful time.<br/>
So anyway, there&#39;s another thing to do in Las Vegas! ;-)<br/>

Hi Robin!  Thanks for all the info.  :)  I&#39;m checking out those groups<br/>
you mentioned.  We&#39;re in CA now actually, but it&#39;s so SO SO expensive<br/>
here... I imagine you know that too!<br/>
<br/>
Heidi mentioned a water problem, and I have heard something about that,<br/>
though don&#39;t know the details.  Do you know the story there?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for the info... So if we go I want to stay north... Got it.<br/>
Lol  :)  I do feel better after your informative and glowing review.  I<br/>
gather in NV you just need to file a notice of intent?  I suppose if I<br/>
find I&#39;m definitely going to end up there I can at that point dig a bit<br/>
deeper into the whats, hows, and wherefores pertaining to the<br/>
homeschooling.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-420792074">Yes, we moved from CA because of the cost of living. We bought so much more house here for the same money, and it was a newer home. I think we doubled our square footage and our environment improved tremendously! Now when we visit CA, it seems so old and yucky looking after living here. Everything is newer here, and so much cheaper. Taxes, gas, fine dining, everything is cheaper and there is more variety. <br/>
<br/>
As far as the water problem goes, Lake Mead is the water source for Vegas, and with the last few years of drought, the lake has gone down drastically. There still are no water restrictions on Vegas yet, and last I heard, they are trying to get CA to stop taking so many shares of the Lake, apparently, they are taking much more than NV is. So at the moment, there is no immediate water problem, and NV is working to insure there won&#39;t be one in the future. <br/>
<br/>
Yes, you just file your notice of intent here and you  are homeschooling. Easy. There is so much to do here, we have to keep curbing our schedule because we join up for too many homeschooling things! <br/>
<br/>
Next time you come up here, take a drive to the NW area. The W is pretty good too. Also Green Valley, and then there is also Henderson which is pretty large and south of vegas - lots of homeschoolers there too!<br/>
