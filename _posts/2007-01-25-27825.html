<div id="ygrps-yiv-1860191765">Hi<br/>
<br/>
Still a newbi but learning so much.  Thanks to everyone.  <br/>
I have a question.  My dd will be 5 next month.  I am in transition <br/>
about learning vs exploring.  In the past I would try to teach my <br/>
ds.  I&#39;m still confused by some things so this question is for <br/>
clarification.  While my daughter was playing in the bathtub.  She <br/>
created an ocean with multiple boats (bowls) with people, etc...  She <br/>
is having a great time.  Anyway she put one of the bowls upside down <br/>
and created an air pocket.  She told me she made an air dome like <br/>
Sandy lives in (spongebob).  it was great.  i then told her it also <br/>
looked like what we saw on pirates of the caribean when captain jack <br/>
sparrow walks under water holding a boat over his head.  <br/>
this allowed him to breath while being underwater.<br/>
<br/>
Should I have given this extra piece of information (she did not ask <br/>
for it).  She thought it was interesting.  Didn&#39;t remember the scene <br/>
and wants us to watch it when she gets out of the ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it has occurred to me that this is not the first time I have <br/>
done this.  When a thought pops into my head like this how do I know <br/>
when to suppress it (not share it) or when it is ok to share.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<br/>
When she doesn&#39;t seem interested in what you have to share, its time to<br/>
stop.    Would you share that information with another adult if you were in<br/>
the same conversation?  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>To me, this is learning by exploring, and is ideal. I wonder if where<br/>
you said learning vs exploring up there, you meant teaching vs<br/>
exploring, or teaching vs learning? Unschooling is not about no input<br/>
at all from you. It&#39;s quite far from that.<br/>
<br/>
Sharing connections that pop into your head is almost always good,<br/>
especially when that leads you all on to more exploring, and<br/>
connecting relationship-wise, like rewatching that movie together. <br/>
<br/>
If your relationship with your child(ren) is an open, honest,<br/>
respectful one, they will let you know if and when you&#39;re oversaying<br/>
or overstepping or piling information beyond their current need or<br/>
interest. Ideally, parents are or become sensitive enough to their<br/>
child(ren), know them well enough, to know when we might be going<br/>
overboard or being pushy if we&#39;re aware we&#39;re that way inclined. It&#39;s<br/>
possible, too, to actually check with your children. Ask them if<br/>
you&#39;re feeling unsure, which helps them know that it&#39;s okay to say no,<br/>
thanks if you&#39;re over-offering. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sharing information is probably something you&#39;d do with a friend or <br/>
your partner, right? And most likely you&#39;d use their reaction to <br/>
gauge whether what you said was appropriate or interesting to that <br/>
person in that moment. It is possible to have that kind of <br/>
information sharing with kids, too, even young kids, without turning <br/>
the whole thing into a &quot;teachable moment&quot; (blech!).<br/>
<br/>
My 5yr old is facinated by &quot;yucky stuff&quot; and also loves to know what <br/>
things are made of - sometimes she asks, other times I offer her <br/>
information, thinking she&#39;ll be interested. I try not to have any <br/>
*expectations* about what she&#39;ll &quot;do&quot; with the information, and I <br/>
think that&#39;s a big part of the difference between &quot;sharing&quot; <br/>
and &quot;teaching&quot;. If I&#39;m sharing something I&#39;m interested mainly in my <br/>
connection with the other person. If I&#39;m teaching, I&#39;m invested in <br/>
some outcome separate from that connection. <br/>
<br/>
My 13yr old stepson *isn&#39;t* interested in the same kinds of &quot;yucky <br/>
stuff&quot; that Mo is. I forget that, sometimes, and throw out pieces of <br/>
information that he really doesn&#39;t want - how cheese is made, for <br/>
example. Mo loves the fact that rennet is made of stomach lining, <br/>
Ray would rather I had never offered him that little snippet of <br/>
information. Oops. I try to be sensitive to that and *not* share <br/>
things that will gross him out (unless he asks - sometimes he&#39;s <br/>
willing to be grossed out) because that would undermine our <br/>
relationship. <br/>

<br/>
Would you have mentioned it to a friend or your husband?<br/>
Would you have liked it if someone had reminded you?<br/>
Would you have said it to someone who had never had a chance to play  <br/>
with water before?<br/>
<br/>
I think when something is interesting and conversational and part of  <br/>
the flow of thinking between two people, it HAS to be said. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-Anyway, it has occurred to me that this is not the first time I have<br/>
done this. When a thought pops into my head like this how do I know<br/>
when to suppress it (not share it) or when it is ok to share.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It helps me to think two steps past, in one way or another.<br/>
Will it continue the conversation or kill it?<br/>
Will it make the person think?<br/>
Will it make them feel better?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t always have all those at the same time. &lt;g&gt;  Sometimes the  <br/>
statement a &#39;Yeah, but did you think of this?&quot; and it might not make  <br/>
them joyful right at that second, but could easily prevent a wad of  <br/>
frustration or disappointment an hour or a week down the road.<br/>
<br/>
I love talking with my friends about what does and doesn&#39;t work.  I  <br/>
scientifically (side by side &lt;g&gt;) tested things I already had to melt  <br/>
ice in front of our garage.  I put Epsom salts on one side, and kitty  <br/>
litter on the other.  Neither is &quot;the right thing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Epsom salts worked better, and I figured that after the snow all  <br/>
melted the kitty litter could clean oil spots on the driveway.  WRONG  <br/>
on that one.  The kitty litter absorbed water and now it&#39;s nasty  <br/>
muddy stuff that I tracked into the house I had just vacuumed.  But  <br/>
it was interseting to discuss it with Keith,and I learned something. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Today I learned how to melt wax in the microwave.  I put water in  <br/>
with it.  It would be hard to impossible to separate that again  <br/>
without letting the wax harden (at least hard enough to pick up, at  <br/>
which point it&#39;s not melted anymore) but I wanted to pour wax on some  <br/>
wood chip and bark junk to use for starting fires in the hot tub.  So  <br/>
I poured the wax and water both over it, and the water will...    <br/>
evaporate is my first thought, but it&#39;s freezing outside. &lt;g&gt;  Holly  <br/>
will care and Keith will care, because we&#39;ve melted wax before and  <br/>
talked about hows and whys.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s interesting and the person cares, keep talking about it.  If  <br/>
the other person doesn&#39;t seem interested, quit.<br/>

OT: I love that movie. My husband is always pointing out the &quot;Ya right!&quot;<br/>
factors in movies- and in the boat underwater scene, my husband says Ya<br/>
right! That couldn&#39;t really be done because they wouldn&#39;t have had enough<br/>

the ice, not to melt or absorb it.<br/>
Didja try just regular old table salt? It spreads out better than the Epsom<br/>

do it with my children.  But then this little voice pops in my head and <br/>

for it).  She thought it was interesting.  Didn&#39;t remember the scene <br/>

<br/>
Anyway, it has occurred to me that this is not the first time I have <br/>
done this.  When a thought pops into my head like this how do I know <br/>
when to suppress it (not share it) or when it is ok to share. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think the answer is &quot;It Depends&quot; - again.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously this time worked very well since the child was interested and<br/>
responded well. If the response had been any kind of blanking, irritation or<br/>
saying any variation of &quot;I don&#39;t want to hear about that&quot; then presumably<br/>
you would stop talking.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn (7) says &quot;I don&#39;t want to know about that&quot; or &quot;Don&#39;t tell me&quot; pretty<br/>
darn clearly at times. I have learnt to ask her if she wants to hear more<br/>
about something. I will say something like, &quot;I know something about ...&quot; or<br/>
&quot;That reminds me of something. Do you want me to tell you about it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In her particular case she will say &quot;yes&quot; I&#39;m guesstimating probably about<br/>
half the time. (Time for me to make a note of these occurrences so that I<br/>
can speak with more certainty.) Just to clarify this is in the absence of<br/>
Jayn asking questions (which I always answer until I see that she is<br/>
satisfied).<br/>
<br/>
There have been some times when I have been really glad that I did NOT say<br/>
anything, because I would have deprived Jayn of a wonderful moment of<br/>
connection and self-discovery. There have been many times when she has taken<br/>
something that I mentioned briefly and gone even further with it. To use<br/>
your example as an analogy, Jayn and I would watch the movie I remembered,<br/>
and then she might remember another movie herself, or a time at the<br/>
aquarium, or some other thing that happened at the beach or..... <br/>
<br/>
I think it is a question of receptivity, and also how likely the child would<br/>
be to come across the information herself in the continuing course of her<br/>
play. Jayn delights me with her ability to notice and express connections. <br/>
<br/>
It is also a question of intention.<br/>
<br/>
Mine is never to make sure Jayn knows something or other. It is always to<br/>
enhance her experience and our relationship. Therefore if I am offering her<br/>
some information it is in order to let her know I support or share her<br/>
interest - even if it is something as ephemeral as air bubbles in the water.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I read you too, Sandra, (and Joyce and lots of other sites and blogs)<br/>
even though I feel fairly comfortable and practised as a mindful<br/>
parent, who then came to actual RU further along our journey. I<br/>
discovered you 2.5 yrs before K came out of school, during the first<br/>
time she seriously considered leaving which had prompted me to first<br/>
begin to research what we needed to do legally here, and how we would<br/>
go about the &#39;educational&#39; side of things. <br/>
<br/>
Seeing as I just read in the sex pages about the criticism you get for<br/>
sharing so much of your children&#39;s lives with others, I do want to say<br/>
that I don&#39;t feel critical of you for that at all. I sometimes wish my<br/>
child were more comfortable with me sharing more of our life when it<br/>
can be so very helpful and enlightening to do so. <br/>
<br/>
I thank Kirby, Marty and Holly too, for their willingnes to give of<br/>
themselves as they do, as you do, Sandra. <br/>

That&#39;s so cool for me to think about.  I get quoted with an  <br/>
Australian accent.  Wow.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Thanks.  I&#39;ll share this with them.  They really  have been poster  <br/>
children for another way of being.<br/>
<br/>
Marty went to a school dance last night.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby&#39;s about to start training on a job that said you have to have a  <br/>
high school diploma or a GED; he has neither.  He&#39;s the only one who  <br/>
passed all the &quot;tests&quot; (informal)  and interviews to do the World of  <br/>
Warcraft customer support.  The rest of them who applied when he did  <br/>
will be doing support for other companies than Blizzard.<br/>
<br/>
Holly was participating in a weekly discussion of medieval virtues,  <br/>
and though she would only say two or three things in a two hour  <br/>
session, her comments were better than most of those others present.   <br/>
When the young (22 year old) wife of one of the participants wanted  <br/>
to start coming, I was talking about it with one of my best regulars  <br/>
and said &quot;I&#39;d like to say she&#39;s too young or new to the group, but  <br/>
Holly&#39;s there.&quot;  He said &quot;Yeah, but Holly&#39;s like 30.&quot;  (She&#39;s 15.  He  <br/>
knows.  He meant to say she&#39;s as mature in that type of discussion as  <br/>
if she were 30, which is too flattering, but still...  she does  <br/>
understand the subject matter better than the 22 year old graduate  <br/>
student does sometimes.)  But now Holly has a Wednesday night  <br/>
babysitting job, so she&#39;s unable to come to the discussions, which is  <br/>
fine because she was going to quit when Lost starts back up in a  <br/>
couple of weeks.<br/>
<br/>
These kids are just not &quot;at their spot&quot; on the conveyor belt.   <br/>
They&#39;re &quot;ahead&quot; some and &quot;behind&quot; some and &quot;beyond&quot; some and  <br/>
&quot;oblivious&quot; some (to traditions concerning school dances, for  <br/>
instance &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
But in every case, they have had the information they&#39;ve requested or  <br/>
that came up naturally in the course of their wanting to know things,  <br/>
or coming across a new activity or topic, or choosing to pursue  <br/>
something or other.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t invite Holly to that philosophy discussion.  We meet in a  <br/>
restaurant that&#39;s walking distance, and one night she was hungry and  <br/>
wanted to go eat and then go home.  She stayed.  She came back.   She  <br/>
was curious about what we were doing, and she likes some of the  <br/>
people there.  Marty goes now too.  Marty&#39;s friend Brett started  <br/>
going.  He first planned to come for the first hour and then go to  <br/>
our house for Kirby&#39;s D&D game.  As it turned out, he goes to the D&D  <br/>
game late.<br/>
<br/>
Had I suggested to any of these kids that they should attend a  <br/>
philosophy discussion that I run, or MADE them go, their being there  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be nearly the same.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve rambled away from the original question, but I&#39;m still in the  <br/>
realm of the quality and value of information that is shared when   <br/>
the listener is interested or  needs to know, and when the listener  <br/>
is free to stay or go, free to change the subject or to ask about  <br/>
something altogether different.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s cool to say that all my kids have jobs.  Except for campus work- <br/>
study jobs (filing cards for the bursar, and working in the  <br/>
cafeteria) I didn&#39;t have a job until I was 20 years old.   Kirby has  <br/>
worked since he was 14, and Marty since he was 15.  Holly&#39;s 15 and  <br/>
got a very good babysitting job, regular through May.  (Whether it  <br/>
will continue after that isn&#39;t important to her.)  People are happy  <br/>
with their work and their presence.   We didn&#39;t &quot;make&quot; them get jobs  <br/>
or even suggest it, in any of those cases.  (I did let Holly know  <br/>
about the babysitting job, but I didn&#39;t say &quot;Look for a babysitting  <br/>
job.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;m ramblng, but there are some more ideas for the collection.<br/>
