<div id="ygrps-yiv-70510325">Hello, I am new here and could use some advice.  We are a family of 7 who have homeschooled from the beginning.  We have used what I would call a relaxed approach, but definitely not unschooling.  I try to combine the desires of each child, what works best for him/her, and what I want them to learn.  We have used mostly Sonlight materials, at our own speed.  So here we are:  my older 2 boys (15 and 13) are good kids, not at all rebellious or disrespectful.  They mostly do the work we decide on, but with NO enthusiasm.  I feel like I am pulling dead weight.  They are not pulling the other way, but they are just laying there like dead bodies! :-)  I&#39;m tired.  I&#39;m trying to change my thinking for their sake.  My oldest was recently diagnosed with mild depression.  Now, I&#39;m not saying that depression comes as a result of schooling choices, but it is causing us to reevaluate.  He says he is bored with school.  Just boxes to check off.  So I took all expectations off of him about 2 weeks ago.  I told him to do whatever he wanted.  He is much more relaxed and happy.  But I think he is still thinking, &quot;I need to be doing something&quot;.   He is artistic and has been spending most of his time drawing, scanning, and photoshopping.  I told him that was fine.  I encouraged him that since he is 15, maybe he could just think about setting some goals.  Nothing rigid, just, &quot;this is where I want to be by next fall because I am interested in taking a class at a junior college&quot;, (which he is interested in).  What is the best way to support him as he deschools?  I have so many questions, thanks for any help, Megan<br/>

<br/>
Passive resistence.   That&#39;s good.<br/>
<br/>
Where are you trying to drag them TO?  What direction are you  <br/>
pulling?  (That&#39;s not an answering question; that&#39;s a private  <br/>
contemplation question.)<br/>
<br/>
-= I&#39;m tired. I&#39;m trying to change my thinking for their sake. -=-<br/>
<br/>
But you&#39;re tired, so it would be for your sake, too.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My oldest was recently diagnosed with mild depression. Now, I&#39;m not  <br/>
saying that depression comes as a result of schooling choices...-=-<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to say it.  We can think it because you mentioned the  <br/>
connection yourself, and you&#39;re there!<br/>
<br/>
-=He says he is bored with school. -=-<br/>
<br/>
You mean school at home, right?  Bored with home schooling?<br/>
<br/>
-=- I told him to do whatever he wanted. He is much more relaxed and  <br/>
happy. But I think he is still thinking, &quot;I need to be doing  <br/>
something&quot;. -=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s because for fifteen years you&#39;ve been telling him what to do,  <br/>
and justifying it for whatever all reasons you&#39;ve justified it.   You  <br/>
taught him to think he needs to be doing something.<br/>
<br/>
And you still believe it too, because you&#39;re telling him &quot;think about  <br/>
setting some goals.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-He is artistic and has been spending most of his time drawing,  <br/>
scanning, and photoshopping. I told him that was fine. I encouraged  <br/>
him that since he is 15, maybe he could just think about setting some  <br/>
goals. Nothing rigid, just, &quot;this is where I want to be by next fall  <br/>
because I am interested in taking a class at a junior college&quot;, (which  <br/>
he is interested in). What is the best way to support him as he  <br/>
deschools? -=-<br/>
<br/>
Not by telling him to set goals.  If he takes a class at a junior  <br/>
college, that does NOT need preparation.  Kirby got the highest test  <br/>
score on a junior college math class he took, and he didn&#39;t even know  <br/>
what the notation looked like when he went in there.   Preparation for  <br/>
college has turned LOTS of kids off to the idea of going to college.<br/>
<br/>
If you want him to deschool, stop talking about junior college or  <br/>
preparations or goals.   Don&#39;t live in next year or next month.  Don&#39;t  <br/>
live in later today.  Live in the moment you look at him and in the  <br/>
moment you speak to him.   Make him comfortable and calm now.   Find  <br/>
ways for him to be at peace for one moment.  If that works, try it  <br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s at the flower shop where she works.   She&#39;s thinking of  <br/>
quitting her job at the mall because the flower shop pays more.   <br/>
Although the deal was she would work in exchange for learning (all  <br/>
except Monday afternoon), she was so quick and reliable and helpful  <br/>
that they just started paying her for all of her hours after the  <br/>
second week.  She worked a LOT just before mother&#39;s day.<br/>
<br/>
She was offered $20 an hour to keep a website for a gallery.   She  <br/>
doesn&#39;t know that.   She wasn&#39;t offered that.  The owner talked to me.  <br/>
I suggested $10 an hour, so she wouldn&#39;t be unhappy with the $8 an  <br/>
hour she makes at the flower shop.  It won&#39;t be lots of hours.   But  <br/>
the reason she was asked is that her MySpace page is really nice, and  <br/>
she has helped with some other people&#39;s images and pages, and this  <br/>
friend knew all that.   She made them a title they LOVE and it took  <br/>
her fifteen minutes.<br/>
<br/>
Holly didn&#39;t &quot;prepare&quot; for any of that, and she didn&#39;t even set  <br/>
goals.  She did what was interesting and fun, and she did it  <br/>
happily.   She has jobs.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby didn&#39;t &quot;prepare&quot; for his jobs, but he played at the same gaming  <br/>
shop for a long time and was helpful and polite and they noticed him.<br/>
<br/>
Marty didn&#39;t &quot;prepare&quot; for jobs, and his jobs don&#39;t sound impressive  <br/>
either.  He worked in a grocery store for 14 or 16 months, and at a  <br/>
restaurant.  Before those, he was making boots and pouches.   But when  <br/>
he has a job the owners and managers love him because he&#39;s happy and  <br/>
reliable.<br/>
<br/>
No matter how much preparation or education someone  might have, if  <br/>
he&#39;s depressed or has come to think being deadweight is the way to  <br/>
survive, no one will want to hire them.<br/>
<br/>

The way to help your son deschool is to read every word there, and  <br/>
follow all the links, and then read it again, and leave him alone to  <br/>
discover happy things online and in his memories and his hopes,  <br/>
without anything that looks, sounds or smells like school or  <br/>
&quot;education.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
I just finished writing a post about creating a happy existence for my<br/>
kids because kids learn better when they are happy!<br/>
<br/>
If your son likes art, and you&#39;ve told him to do whatever he wants and<br/>
that is what he&#39;s doing, why not support him in that?  Instead of being<br/>
passive and saying &quot;do whatever you want&quot;, be proactive and go to the<br/>
art store, get new art supplies, get new inspiration for all that art.<br/>
<br/>
As your kids deschool, they&#39;ll start to gravitate towards the things<br/>
they love to do the most, watch carefully and really see what they are<br/>
doing and exploring and offer more of it.  Offer, don&#39;t force.  Bring<br/>
fun and interesting things and ideas into the house, movies, spontaneous<br/>
odd purchases, and newness.  Go to different stores, and go to different<br/>
outings and parks and streets.  Make things lively and fun.</div>
