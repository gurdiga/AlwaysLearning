<div id="ygrps-yiv-927686499">Unschoolers Potluck Supper and Games:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Calling all SF Bay Area unschoolers, families interested in<br/>
unschooling, and those who like to hang out with unschoolers! Please <br/>
join us for a potluck supper on Wed. July 13, starting at 5 PM at <br/>
Redwood Park in Oakland. Enjoy good food, play games, have fun, and <br/>
make some new unschooling friends.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We will meet at Redwood Park&#39;s Roberts Recreation Area, in the picnic<br/>
area above the parking lot (the grassy field by the playground near<br/>
Roberts Pool). For more information about the location, please see<br/>
www.ebparks.org/parks/robrec.htm. Please bring a dish to share,<br/>
something to drink, a picnic blanket and/or folding chairs, and your<br/>
own plates and eating utensils. There may be a charge for parking,<br/>
so please be prepared with small bills or coins.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Games such as Capture the Flag and Flashlight Tag (don&#39;t forget to<br/>
bring your flashlight!) So that we can have an idea of how many<br/>
people will be coming, please contact either Robyn Talman at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:ratalman@...">ratalman@...</a> or Pam Tellew at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:pamtellew@...">pamtellew@...</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re hoping to get an SF Bay Area unschoolers network started, and<br/>
would love to hear your ideas for other unschooling events or<br/>
gatherings.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We hope to see you there!<br/>
Robyn Talman and Pam Tellew</div>
