Time for public schools to throw in the towel?<br/>

I&#39;ve been collecting clips about schools and teachers around the country <br/>
for the last year, and I have to tell you that I genuinely fear for the <br/>
republic. I say that because, for us &quot;old folks&quot; who were actually taught <br/>
American History in school, a thriving democracy depends upon universal <br/>
education – an education that prepares the citizens of a nation to govern <br/>
themselves through their elected representatives. (Of course, it was the <br/>
presumption of the framers of the Constitution that if one attended school, <br/>
one could be counted on to emerge educated!)<br/>
<br/>
Is it really because they don&#39;t care that so many Americans don&#39;t vote? Or <br/>
is it because they can&#39;t read the ballot? We tend to blame lackluster <br/>
politicians or negative campaigning for low turnout at the polls. But what <br/>
if the real reason is that most of our citizens are not sufficiently <br/>
educated about the basic concepts of democracy to understand the issues – <br/>
even those that directly impact their self interest? And what if that <br/>
ignorance is compounded by illiteracy?<br/>
<br/>
Last fall, the Center for Civic Information at the Manhattan Institute <br/>
published the report of a telephone survey of over 1,000 fourth- and <br/>
eighth-grade teachers. Among the not so surprising findings was that only <br/>
about 25 percent of those surveyed said they most cared about whether a <br/>
student got the right answers. More of them most cared that students tried <br/>
hard or used a creative approach.<br/>
<br/>
That absurd state of affairs has come about because this generation of <br/>
teachers, and probably a few generations before, have themselves been <br/>
raised to believe there are no right answers, anyway. So what difference <br/>
does it make?<br/>
<br/>
For example, our public-school children hear that the Founding Fathers are <br/>
not to be revered. They were greedy, patriarchal oppressors who were in it <br/>
for the money and the power. America is not a noble experiment in freedom <br/>
and equality. That was the cover story, as we stole the land from the <br/>
indigenous people. America wasn&#39;t recently attacked by terrorists. America <br/>
is the terrorist!<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, there are no such things as great books, since all the books <br/>
we were misguided enough to think of as great, were written by those same <br/>
old white male misogynists from the evil empire of Western culture. What&#39;s <br/>
just as great is any diary written by any woman, slave or Native American <br/>
and recently discovered in someone&#39;s trunk. And woe to anyone who disagrees.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, none of it matters anyway, because language itself is fatally <br/>
tainted, and words don&#39;t mean anything. They only mean what my <br/>
idiosyncratic point of view believes they mean. Just ask the <br/>
deconstructionists.<br/>
<br/>
Those deconstructionists have been very busy, because they didn&#39;t stop with <br/>
the English language. They have also pretty successfully deconstructed <br/>
family, religion, values, ethics and morality as well. We all know that, if <br/>
there can be no right answers, there obviously is no right and wrong. No <br/>
one&#39;s behavior can be judged because the most heinous acts can be excused <br/>
on the basis of what the perpetrator may have suffered at the hands of his <br/>
parents, the police, the inequitable society. Yada, yada, yada.<br/>
<br/>
This leads inevitably to &quot;understanding&quot; that immigrant children shouldn&#39;t <br/>
be penalized in school because English is not their first language. And <br/>
what&#39;s so great about patriarchal, oppressive, English anyway? Embrace over <br/>
100 languages in the classroom (as we do in the Los Angeles School <br/>
District) so that no one learns anything – least of all the immigrant <br/>
children who are one day going to grow up as Americans and not even <br/>
understand what that means, let alone what it requires of them or entitles <br/>
them to.<br/>
<br/>
God is dead (although the Wiccan goddess still has a fighting chance, I <br/>
guess) – traditional morality is destructive; excellence is discredited and <br/>
devalued; grades are antiquated. Discipline is discriminatory because <br/>
there&#39;s no such thing as bad behavior, just children with &quot;special needs.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
No wonder teachers are trying to find ways to make their work meaningful, <br/>
since accomplishment and achievement can no longer be benchmarks of <br/>
success. After all, the unaccomplished and underachievers in the class are <br/>
likely to feel bad. Worse, their parents might sue for cruel and unusual <br/>
punishment.<br/>
<br/>
For a few years now, I&#39;ve been urging parents to send their kids to private <br/>
religious schools and/or homeschool them. I truly see no other options for <br/>
raising and educating children to be morally fit, well informed, <br/>
appreciative Americans and contributing members of society.<br/>
<br/>
A shortage of teachers, a kaleidoscope of standards, endemic failure, <br/>
annual budget shortfalls, states taking over local school districts and <br/>
guns in the classroom are unavoidable signs of public-school collapse. I <br/>
think Oregon may have the right idea. They are looking to shorten the <br/>
school year by 15 days. How long before it&#39;s clear to them and to us, that <br/>
we should simply close them altogether?<br/>
