<div id="ygrps-yiv-372820531">I was out and about looking for something and came across this page,  <br/>
dusted it off, and brought it to you guys!<br/>

I&#39;ve been busy elsewhere today, with Holly some and Marty mostly.<br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s Marty, and his voice and mine (very brief).  I&#39;m sleepy but I  <br/>
see I&#39;m many hours behind on e-mail, so if someone asked me something  <br/>
important and I missed it today, I&#39;m sorry.  I&#39;ll be back tomorrow.<br/>
