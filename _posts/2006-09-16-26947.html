<div id="ygrps-yiv-255370015">I just wanted to let everyone know that I cannot keep this project going!  I just don&#39;t have the time or energy to do it right now.  If someone has the interest to partner with the blog carnival, or start up a podcast, I really encourage you to do it!  I started this one because I was wishing there was one and there wasn&#39;t.  It&#39;s at least a couple hours per podcast to put together, but for someone that isn&#39;t working full time as I am, it would not be too much of a commitment.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a lot for the encouragement, and the positive comments from everyone who listened!  I hope that someone will take the idea and run with it!<br/>
<br/>
