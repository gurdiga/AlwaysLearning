          Our theme is <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
        GET THE KIDS OUT <br/>
<br/>
       of HARMFUL SCHOOLS!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
---Everyone at SepCon is an intellectually honest <br/>
<br/>
---seeker of truth and a source of bold ideas.  <br/>
<br/>
---What a super event!!  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
---A must for all physicians who truly care  <br/>
<br/>
---about the children under their care. <br/>
<br/>
     Debra Monde, family physician, Florida <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   That&#39;s a sample of the excitement of all who <br/>
<br/>
have attended the four previous &quot;SepCons&quot; <br/>
<br/>
sponsored by the Alliance for Separation of <br/>
<br/>
School & State.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   SepCon2004 is the conference for those who <br/>
<br/>
recognize that school-by-government simply cannot <br/>
<br/>
be reformed. If we are to ever achieve honest <br/>
<br/>
education---where teachers can honestly tell parents <br/>
<br/>
what they are teaching---we must end government<br/>
<br/>
involvement in schooling &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sepcon.org/index.php">http://sepcon.org/index.php</a>&gt;.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1218223538">The evilness of socialism and collectivism is not the antithesis of <br/>
unschooling? Government controlled education is a subset of socialism <br/>
and collectivism.<br/>
<br/>
What is the whole basic tenet of following one&#39;s own passions in life <br/>
and learning if not the right of self-determination and the pursuit <br/>
of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness through unlimited <br/>
learning?<br/>
<br/>
I am not trying to get political on a personal level, but the <br/>
concepts are basic to freedom to learn, aren&#39;t they? Burning Man <br/>
sounds like a source of challenging assumptions. How many dedicated <br/>
sources are there in our conventional world to non-collective <br/>
thinking?<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not the antithesis of the guy being helped by strangers at Burning Man.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of unschoolers who are also interested in designer communes, <br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
-=-How many dedicated sources are there in our conventional world to <br/>
non-collective <br/>
<br/>
thinking?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Any new project will seem new and exciting and free.<br/>
Any fifth annual will be more stodgy and rule-bound.   <br/>
By tenth annual, the freedom-spark is gone.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s true of just about everything.<br/>
<br/>
The first year of a club or a commune or an event can be magical, and it <br/>
usually springs from the ideas and the work of an individual.<br/>
<br/>
There are sure some rules at Burning Man, aren&#39;t there?  Lots of rules.<br/>
There will be more.<br/>
<br/>
The same happens with anything where one person is responsible for other <br/>
people&#39;s health and happiness.<br/>
<br/>
I bet there are lots of lists on the internet where such things are the topic <br/>
of discussion all the time.<br/>
<br/>
It seems that unschooling, though, can be engaged in by republicans and <br/>
democrats, socialists and communists and libertarians, because it&#39;s about how <br/>
people learn.<br/>
