<div id="ygrps-yiv-694334126">I am right now and I have never been happier.  New to homeschooling.  It is wonderful.  I won&#39;t be single for long.  But I will forever be unschooling.<br/>

Are any of you single Moms? Or were you raised unschooling by a single Mom? <br/>
I am looking at a slight possibility of being one. :(<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am. I&#39;ve been single my son&#39;s whole life. I can&#39;t really imagine <br/>
being married at this point. I really like being able to make whatever <br/>
decisions i want as far as our family is concerned, and not have to <br/>
compromise. <br/>
<br/>
The list that was just started, Crazylifeunschoolers, has a fair <br/>
amount of single parents i think...i&#39;ve been a little busy to keep up <br/>
with all the msgs. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-27247764">Yep.  Single mom here, for our entire unschooling career of five <br/>
years.  It&#39;s been awesome!  I&#39;m getting remarried in July though, <br/>
which almost makes me feel like a sellout.<br/>
