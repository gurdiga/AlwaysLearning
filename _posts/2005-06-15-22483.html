<div id="ygrps-yiv-1349635170">&lt;&lt;&lt;Here is a cool thing that our library is doing, unlike the Summer<br/>
Reading thing. Harry Potter Pajama party. From 9pm to 1am on a<br/>
Friday night they will be screening Prisoner of Azkaban and then<br/>
reading aloud chapter 1 of Half Blood Prince.<br/>
<br/>
A lurker, and a new one at that I am thoroughly enjoying this list.  <br/>
Harry Potter is one of our favorites and we will be celebrating on <br/>
7/15.  To look up a Potter Party near you find www.potterparties.com.  <br/>
We are going to our local B&N for it&#39;s party and the release but are <br/>
using some of the tips from this site to plan our own day-long <br/>
event.    <br/>
Harry took our house by storm last year.  I read all 5 to my then 6 yo <br/>
non-reader and within a year he began reading them himself.  He is now <br/>
on the fifth himself and wants to finish before the HBP is released.  <br/>
BYW We have all the &quot;warning&quot; relatives as well.  Of course none of <br/>
them have read a page which I am sure would change them since JK <br/>
Rowling is just Brilliant, IMO.<br/>
