<div id="ygrps-yiv-1112557182">We just bought bb guns (air soft) for my two sons who are ten. They <br/>
were temporarily happy just shooting targets that we made. Eric is not <br/>
happy with this anymore, and really wants to shoot at birds. He likes <br/>
that they move and it is more of a challenge. I guess it is the hunting <br/>
instinct. I don&#39;t feel good about him shooting at birds. For one thing, <br/>
I think he would be really upset if he wounded one and had to see it <br/>
suffer. I would be upset as well. I tried making some targets that move-<br/>
things hanging in trees, etc. He still isn&#39;t happy with this. We live <br/>
in a suburban neighborhood, so he can&#39;t just go up and down the street <br/>
shooting at whatever he wants to. I wish he could, but we need to have <br/>
concern for our neighbors. I also of course have those deep seated <br/>
fears around him wanting to shoot birds. He has always loved animals, <br/>
and I am trying to get my head around the fact that there isn&#39;t <br/>
anything wrong with what he is wanting to do. (Is there?!) Any ideas on <br/>
how I can help him get his needs met? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You might want to check the legality of the guns and be sure you&#39;re  <br/>
not using them where it isn&#39;t allowed. Turns out that where I live  <br/>
there is NO place to shoot them, legally, except at a couple of  <br/>
shooting ranges intended specifically for that purpose. The police  <br/>
are extremely strict about enforcement.<br/>
<br/>
That said, there is protective clothing and masks and all that - they  <br/>
can shoot at each other if you get them well-outfitted.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I certainly understand that.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had airsoft guns here for the last couple of years, and Cam (13) is<br/>
very active with it...he&#39;s been asked to join a local team here that is<br/>
supposed to be getting sponsored.<br/>
<br/>
As far as I know, he&#39;s only shot at people (willing people :o), but as Pam<br/>
suggested, you might want to see what the law is where you are. If it isn&#39;t<br/>
legal to shoot birds with airsoft, that helps your cause. If it is legal,<br/>
maybe letting him experience it will bring him to his own conclusions.<br/>
<br/>
Have you looked at those devices that shoot model clay birds (can&#39;t remember<br/>
what their called), which is done for sport? Maybe that would satisfy the<br/>
desire.<br/>
<br/>
If he really wants to hunt birds, if that is what the drive is, maybe<br/>
looking in your area for resources that support hunting (hunting ranges,<br/>
hunting stores, etc...most places have limited hunting seasons).<br/>
<br/>
If he just wants moving targets, airsofting with people is pretty dang<br/>
exciting (with all the gear of course). We started off pretty slow...just a<br/>
few kids and an adult, lots of information and discussion about how everyone<br/>
wanted it to work...always had a &quot;safe&quot; place in the yard for anyone who<br/>
didn&#39;t want to get shot...this progressed to the kids setting it up<br/>
completely independently, and having &quot;tournaments&quot; in different people&#39;s<br/>
yards with great obstacles and hiding places. Cam is very quick, agile and<br/>
an accurate shooter...this has been an exciting sport for him.<br/>

Pigeon, pigeon launcher.  Skeet.  I don&#39;t think you could hurt one  <br/>
with a BB gun.<br/>
<br/>
What about paper airplanes or toy parachute guys or the little flat  <br/>
balsa wood airplanes or styrofoam airplanes?  They could launch  <br/>
something cheap and easy and try to shoot it in flight.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1654994332">Thank you for all of the ideas. I will look into all of them. I think <br/>
Eric would love being able to shoot at other people. I will look into <br/>
our laws first though. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
