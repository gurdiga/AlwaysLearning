<div id="ygrps-yiv-134494797">Hi Joanna -<br/>
Thanks so much for sharing your situation.....<br/>
<br/>
Here are my thoughts: <br/>
<br/>
I was at a retreat this weekend in the tradition of Thich Nhat Hanh and there <br/>
was talk of watering wholesome seeds - take care of your wholesome seeds - <br/>
joy, love, happiness, compassion - so that you are strong to handle the <br/>
unwholesome seeds - doubt, fear, frustration, anxiety - as they come up..... And when <br/>
the unwholesome seeds do grow tall and strong, recognize them, take care of <br/>
them, lullabye them - and attend to the wholesome seeds to help them be <br/>
stronger..... Nature is good for wholesome seeds..... <br/>
<br/>
Find a middle road..... when two seemingly polar options are both distasteful <br/>
- pause, wait, let go of outcome, breathe, let go, and find something else to <br/>
do - especially something that nurtures you or your relationship with <br/>
Jack.... <br/>
<br/>
I have seen MAGIC happen when one lets go!  I bet you have, too!  Just when <br/>
you think it&#39;ll never happen..... BOOM - it comes from a different direction <br/>
and perhaps in a different form!  Letting go frees us to SEE!<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s our experience with reading (me and Jaclyn 9yo - who is writing this <br/>
with me):<br/>
When she was 7, it was hard not to be a &#39;reader&#39; because other people were <br/>
reading and it sounded so fun.  She was motivated but it seems her mind and body <br/>
were not ready.  Now she is 9 and about 6 months ago (just after she turned <br/>
9), things just really clicked in incredible ways and she started reading <br/>
chapter books (esp. A-Z Mysteries series).  She says that she basically didn&#39;t read <br/>
until she was 9.  She has read all 21 books in that series.   <br/>
I tried to do word cards with her when she was 5 or so and it was very clear <br/>
that her mind/eyes/whatever were not putting together the written information. <br/>
 <br/>
Similarly, it was a difficult for me sometimes bec. A. she&#39;s a girl and girls <br/>
read earlier, right?  B. she&#39;s a homeschooler and homeschoolers read earlier, <br/>
right? and C. she was my oldest and the oldest reads earlier, right? and D. I <br/>
was a special ed teacher - and teachers know what to do with teaching <br/>
reading, right?  <br/>
Phew!  I guess watching her learn reading allowed me to &#39;water the seeds&#39; of <br/>
trust - bec. I had to do it over and over and over....  <br/>
And, also, I would not change anything about her struggle with reading and <br/>
her incredible satisfaction with having taught herself to read!  She figured it <br/>
out on her own!!   Like you said that Game Cube teaches reading, I think <br/>
Jaclyn learned from road signs while we were in the car!  (Jaclyn agrees with me!)  <br/>
 Jaclyn says she likes how she learned to read bec. if she had read earlier <br/>
she probably wouldn&#39;t have read the books she likes so much now.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Joanna, Trust yourself.....  trust Jack..... trust the process.....  <br/>
If it doesn&#39;t feel good, don&#39;t do it...... When in doubt, don&#39;t......  <br/>
Let go..... let go..... and let the magic begin!!<br/>
<br/>
Much love, <br/>
Jane<br/>
