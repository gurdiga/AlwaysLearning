<div id="ygrps-yiv-1363860711">Jeffrey (12) loves playing PS2 and PS3 games.  His current favorites <br/>
are:<br/>
<br/>
Mercenaries series<br/>
Grand Theft Auto series<br/>
Battlefield Bad Company<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s tried World of Warcraft.  He&#39;s not a big fantasy genre lover.  He <br/>
did enjoy running his character around and exploring the areas, but <br/>
didn&#39;t care about doing quests or fighting to gain levels.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s looking for something new and interesting to try.  Any suggestions?<br/>

I read this to Marty (who&#39;s dressed for work and playing Rock Band  <br/>
until it&#39;s time to drive).  He suggested SoCom Navy Seals.<br/>

Every one in our house highly recommends Rock Band! It is great to play  <br/>
alone, it&#39;s great to play together and Wyl loves picking out tunes on the radio,  <br/>
now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1114465858">Runescape online with it&#39;s medieval settings provides lots of places <br/>
to explore. Your character can also mine and smelt your own metal, <br/>
harvest food, mill flour, selling and barter trade your items. <br/>
<br/>
Roblox.com is lego games and building online.<br/>
<br/>
Any of the Lego games - Star Wars, Indiana Jones<br/>
<br/>
Sim city<br/>
