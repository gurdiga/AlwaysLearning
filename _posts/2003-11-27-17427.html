* /The Cat Years/ from the San Francisco Chronicle by<br/>

*I** just realized that while children are dogs --<br/>
loyal and <br/>
affectionate-- teenagers are cats. It&#39;s so easy to be<br/>
a dog owner.  You <br/>
feed it, train it, boss it around. It puts its head on<br/>
your knee and <br/>
gazes at you as if you were a Rembrandt painting.  It<br/>
bounds indoors <br/>
with enthusiasm when you call it.*<br/>
<br/>
*Then, around age 13, your adoring little puppy turns<br/>
into a big old <br/>
cat.<br/>
Oh, it&#39;s terribly obnoxious, but I think they MEAN well. (Which is always one <br/>
of the worst things you can say about somebody. You know they&#39;re $%#@$% up <br/>
somewhere.)  <br/>
<br/>
The point, at least, seems to be to try to understand a developmental change, <br/>
and that it&#39;s normal. The analogy is not wonderful...but it all could be <br/>
worse. And as insulting as it is to teenagers, I think this person has some bias <br/>
against cats they should really look at.<br/>
