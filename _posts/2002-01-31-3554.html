flat refused.  She sensibly asked just how much it *hurts,* and I told her I<br/>
couldn&#39;t sleep for a week afterward.  My first job was in a mall store that,<br/>
among other things, pierced ears; when they did kids, they got two<br/>
employees, one on each ear.  They knew if they did only one, they&#39;d *never*<br/>
get get the second in.  Dd is horrified by the sight of babies with pierced<br/>
ears, because they had no choice in it.<br/>

it&#39;s cheep and you can mark out where you want the holes.  The person<br/>
getting the piercing needs to have a strong stomach when you use the<br/>
needle method because of the crunching, grinding noise.  I was eight, and<br/>
she was sixteen and I did hers too.  They&#39;re not THAT crooked.  = /<br/>
<br/>
I had one piercing done at the mall and it turned out ok. <br/>
<br/>
I and some other people I know of, can&#39;t wear earrings with nickel<br/>
content.  I don&#39;t know why, but it causes some kind of reaction.  Maybe<br/>
starting out with a nice pair of gold earrings would ward off<br/>
complications.  <br/>

Good Luck!  I wonder when my kids will ask to have something pierced.  I have <br/>
4 holes in my left ear (as my father said years ago, &quot;Why do you need another <br/>
hole in your head?&quot;  what a supportive guy : P) and one in my right ear and <br/>
one through my right nostril.  Hopefully they won&#39;t really start asking until <br/>
10 or so.  Dh wants them to wait until their first moon cycle so it can be a <br/>
&quot;right of passage&quot; sign.  I really like that idea, but we&#39;ll see how it goes.<br/>

I don&#39;t think it&#39;s bad to do it at the mall.<br/>
<br/>
After my adventures in childbirth and well-baby checkups, I&#39;m thinking I&#39;d <br/>
trust mall girls over doctors, if I&#39;m not bleeding to death.  (I&#39;ll probably <br/>
get over it some, but aversions are aversions.)<br/>

You could put marks right where you want the holes with a water-base marker.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1292337227">I&#39;m sad about earrings.  I had mine pierced by a girlfriend in college - the <br/>
ice and needle thing.  I wore earrings for years -- then in my mid 30&#39;s <br/>
developed an allergic reaction to all of them.  Didn&#39;t matter what metal or <br/>
coating I put on the stems.  I quit wearing them for years and then tried a <br/>
pair from Claire&#39;s which claimed they were &quot;super&quot; hypoallergenic - half an <br/>
hour, no deal.  grumble.  I miss wearing them.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway -- Emma mentioned getting her ears pierced when she was six or so <br/>
because some friends were doing it, and I told her 10  would be a good time.  <br/>
She was also very sensitive about pain AND I wanted to give her time to get <br/>
some perspective on her decision.  But this summer, she fell in love with <br/>
Claire&#39;s boutique -- all the cutsie little hair things.  We watched several <br/>
people get ears pierced -- and she took the procedure in...thought about <br/>
it...and decided to try magnetic earrings for a while.  They&#39;re pretty neat.  <br/>
So she wears them now and then -- more often not.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s an alternative while they think about it.<br/>

mall when she was 4, which was fine except the dippy woman asked her a<br/>
question about something to distract her and then pierced the ear... so<br/>
the second ear she tried that and I said &quot;Here it comes!&quot;, which was<br/>
better. Those stayed open maybe a year or two but eventually closed up<br/>
for lack of earrings...<br/>
<br/>
Then she decided to have it done again when she was 7, but she was with<br/>
her dad at the time and they didn&#39;t check with me, and it was the<br/>
beginning of soccer season and you can&#39;t play with earrings in. So she<br/>
took &#39;em out, and hasn&#39;t asked again since. It really isn&#39;t a big deal to<br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
I remember I got my ears pierced when Amy Carter was allowed to pierce<br/>
hers, I&#39;m just about exactly her age so maybe I was 8? It was a big deal<br/>
then among girls my age, if the president&#39;s daughter could do it, we<br/>
could too ;-)<br/>

<br/>
On why NOT to get a Gun Piercing. <br/>
<br/>
Peggy<br/>
<br/>
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>
<br/>
why a needle piercing is superior to a gun piercing<br/>
by Lish Daelnar<br/>
<br/>
1. sterilization:<br/>
<br/>
- guns cannot be autoclaved. if put in an autoclave (sterilization<br/>
device), it will melt. the only sterile part about the gun<br/>
piercing is the stud itself, which is not acceptable when placed<br/>
into a non-sterile environment (read: the gun itself.) guns are<br/>
sanitized (not sterilized; big difference) with windex, which will<br/>
not kill hep-b, hep-c, & most of the microbes that cause<br/>
infection, nor will it clean up the spray of plasma & if blood,<br/>
perhaps blood-borne pathogens, from the previous customer.<br/>
<br/>
- every tool used in a &#39;needle pierce&#39; is autoclaved, not just the<br/>
jewelry. this includes the forceps, needle, the jewelry, ring<br/>
opening / ring closing pliers, the rubber band that holds the<br/>
tension on the forceps, right down to the field on which the<br/>
bacitracin is squeezed. (bacitracin is used as lubrication to <br/>
make it easier for the needle & jewlery to go through the skin.)<br/>
<br/>
- cleanliness of the piercer. to be a &quot;pro with a gun&quot;, the<br/>
&quot;piercer&quot;<br/>
must only know how to load the gun & aim straight. this does not<br/>
account for cross-contamination from touching other objects with<br/>
latex gloves on, nor does it cover the occasional spray of blood<br/>
from a previous piercee, from which the gun cannot be properly<br/>
cleansed. professional piercers are trained in how to prevent<br/>
cross-contamination & the transmission of blood-borne pathogens<br/>
& you&#39;ll see them changing their gloves every time they touch<br/>
something non-autoclaved. the APP (the association of professional<br/>
piercers) watches over procedures & if you&#39;re being pierced by an<br/>
APP-approved shop, you know the piercer has been through<br/>
the classes that teach him these things. the &quot;piercers&quot; that work<br/>
in the mall & use guns have no such organization.<br/>
<br/>
- the stud itself. the gun can only hold a butterfly-back stud, & if<br/>
you&#39;ve ever seen one, you know that they&#39;re difficult to clean<br/>
properly. dried lymph fluids (& sometimes, initially, blood) get<br/>
caught in this backing & make it easier to contract infection.<br/>
initial &#39;needle-pierce&#39; jewelry is generally a ring, which makes<br/>
cleaning much easier due to there being nowhere for discharge,<br/>
hair, dirt, & bacteria to get stuck. studs also have a tendency to<br/>
become wrapped with hair, which can imbed the hair in the<br/>
piercing.<br/>
<br/>
2. trauma to the ear:<br/>
<br/>
- as previously stated, the gun can only hold one type of stud, the<br/>
dimensions of which happen to be 18ga, approximately 1/4&quot; in<br/>
length. this small gauge is generally inappropriate for any area<br/>
of cartilage (upper ear, nostrils) for two reasons. one, it&#39;s<br/>
tougher to heal a small hole than it is a large one. a dermal<br/>
punched (like a big hole punch) 2ga ear cartilage piercing will<br/>
heal months faster than a 18ga gun OR needle pierce in the same<br/>
area of tissue, on the same person, due to the surface area<br/>
involved. the second reason concerns the initial hole size.<br/>
cartilage should be pierced with a step larger needle than jewelry<br/>
(14ga needle with 16ga jewelry, et cetera), as this gives the<br/>
cartilage some room to grow in around the piercing. i&#39;ve proven<br/>
this on myself - the only cartilage piercings i&#39;m still having<br/>
trouble with were pierced with either the same size needle as<br/>
jewlery or a gun.<br/>
<br/>
- when a gun piercing is performed, the end of the stud is what<br/>
creates<br/>
the hole. this is much more traumatic for the ear, as the stud<br/>
isn&#39;t nearly sharp enough to avoid compacting the tissue, leading<br/>
to a longer healing period. a needle is razor-sharp & carves a<br/>
cresent-shaped hole in the ear which is stretched round as the<br/>
rest of the needle continues through the newly made hole. less<br/>
compacted tissue leads to quicker healing.<br/>
<br/>
- the length of the stud, 1/4&quot;, is too short to allow for swelling.<br/>
the<br/>
pierce needs to be given room to swell so as to prevent pain &<br/>
possible imbedding of the stud in the ear. rings used as initial<br/>
jewelry, which cannot be installed with a gun piercing, when sized<br/>
properly, give plenty of room to swell. rings are chosen based on<br/>
the size of the person&#39;s ear to be pierced (standard is 3/8&quot; to<br/>
5/8&quot; in diameter). this cannot be done with a gun.<br/>
<br/>
3. pain:<br/>
<br/>
- a quick push with a razor-sharp needle is less painful than an<br/>
equally<br/>
quick click of a dull stud tearing a hole through tissue. a good<br/>
professional piercer can move a needle just as fast as the gun<br/>
moves the stud.<br/>
<br/>
- the ear is less sensitive when it has proper room to swell. even<br/>
my<br/>
large gauge ear piercings were MUCH less sore the next day than my<br/>
regular gauge gunned earlobe piercings, even though the procedure<br/>
of my larger ones (pierce at 12ga, tapered stretch immediately to<br/>
6ga * ) was rather traumatic to the lobe tissues.<br/>
( * initial stretching this quickly was improper. i had asked to<br/>
be pierced at 10ga, which would have prevented the slight tearing<br/>
i experienced along the edges of the cresent cut by the needle.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
why a gun piercing is superior to a needle piercing:<br/>
<br/>
- gun piercings generally run two for ten dollars. needle piercings,<br/>
including the jewelry, are normally twenty for one, depending on<br/>
the chosen jewlery.<br/>
<br/>
- gun piercings look less scary than needle piercings. there are<br/>
less<br/>
tools involved & no inch & a half long needle. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
any body part other than an ear generally cannot be fit into a gun.<br/>
there<br/>
have been cases of nipple & navel pierces with a gun, but they can<br/>
easily<br/>
be torn out with such a small gauge, & as well, there&#39;s no room for<br/>
the<br/>
body part to swell (& body piercings often swell much more than<br/>
earlobes.)<br/>
i&#39;ve covered the two major reasons cartilage shouldn&#39;t be pierced<br/>
with a<br/>
gun, due to the stud itself, & that doesn&#39;t even get into<br/>
sterilization.<br/>
lobes can be pierced successfully at 18ga, although the stud still<br/>
leaves<br/>
insufficient room for swelling, as well as the evil of the butterfly<br/>
backs.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-685744116">I never did get my ears pierced.  I am not<br/>
particularly squeamish, well, not at all really,<br/>
except when it comes to needles + my body.  Then I<br/>
start to turn a little green.  That and I figured out<br/>
when I was a kid that I LOVED earrings.  I was<br/>
fascinated by them.  I fondled them in stores, I<br/>
bought them as gifts for friends,  I looked longingly<br/>
at them wherever they could be found, I still notice<br/>
them whenever people wear them.  I decided that if I<br/>
ever got my ears pierced, I would spend every penny I<br/>
had on earrings.  LOL<br/>
<br/>
But seriously, I have hair like Sandra&#39;s and they<br/>
would no doubt irritate the heck out of me getting all<br/>
tangled up in my hair.  I already have hairs pulled<br/>
out every day by my glasses, much to my irritation,<br/>
and I HAVE to wear those.<br/>

Yes, but do they ever really feel anything with intensity?  I don&#39;t know if I would want to give up my intensity even if at times I can&#39;t sleep because of it.  Once I got so excited about plans I was making for a garden, A GARDEN, that I woke up and couldn&#39;t get back to sleep because of the adrenaline.

Not that I&#39;ve seen.  And which is better?  To never get thrilled but never be <br/>
heartbroken, or to have ecstacy and depression?<br/>

I&#39;ve heard it said various ways that as high as your high is, that&#39;s how low <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-445547171">oh gol,  my daughter asked and asked and begged and begged EVERY day for a<br/>
month to have her ears pierced- I explained how it would really hurt, got<br/>
her stick-on earrings, magnet earrings, told her how she would have to clean<br/>
them and if she didn&#39;t, how they might get infected... and I finally took<br/>
her down there, as she looked at her new earrings in the mirror crying, she<br/>
said &quot;pretty..so pretty!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I got gruff for it from some people because she was only 2, when I would<br/>
say- &quot;but she really, really wanted them..&quot; they would look at me like<br/>
RIGHT- *you* just wanted them.  but she cleaned them herself every day<br/>
twice.<br/>
<br/>
Got the same kind of gruff when I took her to ballet class when she was<br/>
three- (she had been begging for a year) She loves dance SO much- she knew<br/>
herself even when she was a little gal (now she is 13)-<br/>
<br/>
Funny how when your kid does something &quot;late&quot; (ds 9 not reading) people say<br/>
it is because of something you did- and if they do something &quot;early&quot; (dd<br/>
wanting pierced ears) it is because of what you did...like our societies&#39;<br/>
whole framework leaves out the fact of the child as a person at all.<br/>
