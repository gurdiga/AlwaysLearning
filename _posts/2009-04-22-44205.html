Is he interested in formal debate rules?<br/>
Some of the best debating I&#39;ve seen these days is in blog comments.   <br/>
Some of the worst, too, for sure, but some blogs have actually USEful  <br/>
comments! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
he *might* be!  just blogs in general you mean?  we end  up in discussions that interest us and then we explore both sides of the issue, in an informal debate style  - &quot;playing devil&#39;s advocate&quot;, etc.  but i feel stumped for some creative topic ideas and would love a list of ideas to spur my imagination!<br/>

Maybe you could work from some kind of current events source and pick  <br/>
a topic, and if some really good arguments come out of your arguments  <br/>
or reseach, maybe one of you could post there, and then see what  <br/>
responses come.   Seems that could flower into more discussions of  <br/>
types of arguments.<br/>
<br/>
A tool for debating (and for just about everything, all kinds of  <br/>
logic) is to play 20 questions a bit, and learn what kinds of guesses  <br/>
are bad guesses and which are good ones.<br/>
<br/>
You could start with the numerical version, where someone guesses a  <br/>
number between 1 and 1000 in 20 guesses.   Here&#39;s an online version of  <br/>
that if you don&#39;t want to do it on your own.  The only answer to each  <br/>
guess can be &quot;higher&quot; or &quot;lower&quot; or &quot;that&#39;s it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I thought I had written about 20 questions, but I guess I spoke about  <br/>
it at a conference.   The strategy is to try to divide the world in  <br/>
half with each question.<br/>
<br/>
With debate, when someone is trying to divide the world in half, it&#39;s  <br/>
usually a logical fallacy, or it&#39;s creating a dichotomy when ends up  <br/>
being kind of &quot;good guy&quot; and &quot;stupid bad guy,&quot; so by playing the game  <br/>
some, you could learn to recognize when someone&#39;s doing that, or in  <br/>
your own arguments, to only divide in half that part of the world/ <br/>
thinking that you&#39;re dealing with.   If you don&#39;t want to compare  <br/>
apples to oranges, how will you divide and compare the apples?   And  <br/>
if you&#39;re talking about apples produced commercially, for shipping,  <br/>
there&#39;s no sense talking about fragile kinds of apples that people  <br/>
grow and eat at home but aren&#39;t suitable for packing up and storing  <br/>
and shipping.<br/>
<br/>
One of the recent videos of me is on a blog I was looking at this  <br/>
morning.   It&#39;s a kind of &quot;everything&quot; blog and today there&#39;s a bit by  <br/>
Jim Carey about vaccinations and autism.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Oh!  There&#39;s an article there about the family of one of the slumdog  <br/>
millionaire child actors offering to sell their child, or something.   <br/>
A doctor says he can clone a human.<br/>
<br/>
On Youtube there was some criticism of my support of unschooling (sort  <br/>
of) and I&#39;ve already responded, but that might be the kind of thing  <br/>
you could get involved in as both practice AND real use of debate  <br/>
skills.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1070583846">I loved speech and debate in high school and college. I enjoyed<br/>
extemporaneous and Lincoln-Douglas Debate. Maybe he would enjoy trying out<br/>
L-D debate with you or one of his friends?<br/>
Here&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/3265420/Introduction-to-Lincoln-Douglas-">http://www.scribd.com/doc/3265420/Introduction-to-Lincoln-Douglas-</a>&gt;is<br/>
a site that explains L-D debate format. L-D is about values, not<br/>
policy,<br/>
so if it&#39;s the nuts and bolts of a topic, you&#39;d have to tweak the debate a<br/>
bit, but that could be interesting in its own right.<br/>
<br/>
