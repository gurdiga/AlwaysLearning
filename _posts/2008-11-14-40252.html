There is one cool toy.  I wouldn&#39;t say &quot;math&quot; or if you do, don&#39;t  <br/>
talk about numbers much.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who aren&#39;t sure yet how to see math in art and that,  <br/>
maybe this will help.  It couldn&#39;t hurt. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Holly and I played with it for a long time this afternoon.  She likes  <br/>
doing long straight lines.  I like flowery looking stuff.  And  <br/>
although it looks kinda kaleidoscopic, it isn&#39;t.  You&#39;re not limited  <br/>
to one wedge as with a kaleidoscope.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a link there to other games on the same site.  I haven&#39;t  <br/>
checked them out and am about to have company so I can&#39;t right now.   <br/>
If anyone finds good ones, though, feel free to report and comment here!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-596250401">As one of the people who used the word &quot;autonomy&quot; on Sandra&#39;s site I guess I<br/>
should join this conversation. To be honest I&#39;m a bit surprised that the<br/>
idea of autonomy is being considered as a negative, outside of the<br/>
translation difficulty.<br/>
<br/>
In the context of my little piece on television, I was talking about<br/>
autonomy as the character&#39;s freedom to make decisions and take actions<br/>
without constantly having to ask permission of their parents or some other<br/>
authority. The characters are making decisions and taking actions <br/>
independently of authority figures, to an unrealistic outlandish extent.<br/>
Sometimes there are problematic consequences, which is the<br/>
&quot;hi-jinks&quot;, and sometimes the results are positive. I&#39;m immediately thinking<br/>
of the time Raven covered herself with clay and feathers and got on a bus to<br/>
help her friend. The underlying paradigm in all these family comedies is one <br/>
of separation of parents and children, coupled with the belief that the <br/>
parents &quot;job&quot; is to stymie the whacky plans and put road blocks in their <br/>
kids&#39; way - two pieces of thinking that are the opposite of unschooling <br/>
practice.<br/>
<br/>
Also I believe I referred to &quot;more&quot; autonomy. There is a wide variation<br/>
between the notion of &quot;absolute autonomy&quot; - which we can define as no notion <br/>
or regard for community or other<br/>
people - and the near zero autonomy created by the circumscribed life that<br/>
most regular kids seem to live - at least the bits of lives that I see when<br/>
I go out in public and listen to conventional parents with their kids at <br/>
places like the park, the store, museums and the YMCA swimming pool - the<br/>
constant barrage of orders and minutiae of control from the parents, the<br/>
endless ENDLESS checking from the kids as to whether it&#39;s ok to eat a candy <br/>
or take off one&#39;s<br/>
sweater or go to the bathroom that the kids seem to take as normal<br/>
interactions. And just to clarify I&#39;m talking about asking permission way <br/>
beyond what might be<br/>
considered  plain politeness on the part of a youngster, the kind of <br/>
courteous checking in that our unschooled kids increasingly show with <br/>
maturity like whether the last soda in the fridge is spoken for.<br/>
<br/>
I also found this page of links:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ask.com/web?q=Principle+of+Autonomy&qsrc=6&o=10601">http://www.ask.com/web?q=Principle+of+Autonomy&qsrc=6&o=10601</a><br/>
<br/>
I like this definition of the Principle of Autonomy:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The principle of respect for autonomy, Respect for autonomy, then, should<br/>
not be construed as an absolute and foundational value, but a &quot;middle<br/>
principle&quot; that requires every individual to respect every other <br/>
individual&#39;s<br/>
self-determination to an appropriate extent within the context of<br/>
community.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
especially when combined with this idea:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The principle of autonomy, or self-determination, entails respecting the<br/>
choices and wishes of persons who have the capacity to decide and protecting<br/>
those who lack this capacity.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The freedom (within the law of the land) to make personal decisions and take <br/>
actions based on one&#39;s own<br/>
judgment, without having to ask permission of some perceived authority <br/>
figure (that<br/>
permission is not required) - that is what autonomy means to me.<br/>
<br/>
There seems to be a perception that autonomy has &quot;separation&quot; as it&#39;s <br/>
foundation which could be a problem for unschooling.<br/>
However these definitions show that the idea of community and the idea of <br/>
parental guidance,<br/>
 are both included even wrapped up in the working definition of &quot;autonomy&quot; <br/>
already.<br/>
<br/>
I allow Jayn as much autonomy as I can, especially since in the wider world <br/>
conventional ideas - about how<br/>
little autonomy she should be allowed, how little &quot;capacity&quot; she must have<br/>
to understand her own wishes (in conventional thinking about kids), how few<br/>
rights to enact decisions most parents give their children - conventional<br/>
ideas appear overwhelmingly against granting any autonomy to a child.<br/>
<br/>
This may not help with the problem of translating to another language<br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps there might be something useful for translations in the idea of<br/>
independence of thought. I like the definition in &quot;Now Voyager&quot; (Bette<br/>
Davis, Paul Henried - 1942). To the best of my recollection:<br/>
<br/>
Charlotte: &quot;Independence of mind means relying on one&#39;s own will and<br/>
judgement.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This was from an adult who had been mercilessly squashed and bossed and<br/>
controlled all her life to the point of having a nervous breakdown and<br/>
having to relearn to trust her own judgment and opinions and become free of <br/>
fear.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn is very determined in protecting her right to express her opinion, her <br/>
wants, her intended or desired course of action. I believe she has a very <br/>
strong sense of self. She is going to make bad decisions sometimes. I have <br/>
learnt, with Jayn&#39;s particular temperament, that the negative energy and <br/>
anger resulting from trying to guide her away from bad decisions (or speed <br/>
up her process) are usually more than the small amount of negative energy <br/>
resulting from her persisting in enacting the bad decision - especially when <br/>
I act as a cushion (to use a familiar example just quietly putting the <br/>
sweater or the other shoes into my bag.)<br/>
<br/>
She will loudly protest &quot;it&#39;s MY decision&quot; and doesn&#39;t like hearing at all <br/>
that there are times when it is NOT. She is still learning where her <br/>
autonomy meets the community, still learning how her decisions can affect <br/>
the members of her family. I&#39;m still waiting for the full flowering of <br/>
empathy, even as I am finally seeing moments of it.  We have been having <br/>
struggles with what I can only see as her self-centeredness. I am sometimes <br/>
baffled. Jayn will say that she is &quot;the most important thing&quot;, and it has <br/>
been hard for her to hear that even if that is so, she is not the only <br/>
thing. Sometimes the only thing that has changed her obnoxious behavior or <br/>
her thinking has been very strong disapproval from her father and I. So <br/>
while there is autonomy, there are also boundaries to it.<br/>
<br/>
And yet it may be that my thinking on this is all wrong, that I should be <br/>
thinking more in terms of our family community of three rather than as three <br/>
individuals dancing together. Perhaps we could talk a little about hierarchy <br/>
in family structure.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-429743668">-=-Charlotte: &quot;Independence of mind means relying on one&#39;s own will  <br/>
and judgement.&quot;-=-<br/>
&quot;Relying&quot; is even too strong for me.  Although someone might choose  <br/>
to or need to rely on her own will and judgement, it&#39;s ideally a  <br/>
choice to do so.  I don&#39;t mind relying on Keith for some things.  If  <br/>
he dies or leave I&#39;ll have to &quot;rely&quot; on my self or someone else for  <br/>
those things (bill paying, oil changing, wood chopping), and if I  <br/>
disappear Keith will need to do his own mending, laundry, shopping  <br/>
and dishes, or find someone to do those things.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t rely on my own judgment, even about unschooling and  <br/>
parenting.  I talk to Keith.  I talk to other parents I trust whose  <br/>
kids have been through what mine are starting to go through.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t rely on my own will.  We just returned home safely from a big  <br/>
outing yesterday, four people, over 500 miles travelled and home  <br/>
again.  I needed them to want to agree to go.  I didn&#39;t personally  <br/>
earn the $200 for the theatre tickets.  I didn&#39;t do any of the  <br/>
driving.  It was my idea, though, and my purchase and planning and  <br/>
letter to the grandparents.  I wrote the checklist for what to take  <br/>
in the car.  But if any of those other three had said &quot;not fun&quot; or &quot;I  <br/>
don&#39;t want to,&quot; it wouldn&#39;t have been fun.  It was something we did  <br/>
as a group.   I relied on them for some parts, and they relied on me  <br/>
for some parts, and that&#39;s how it happened.<br/>
<br/>
Keith and I met in a Renaissance music group.  No one person can sing  <br/>
madrigals alone.  I ended up being the coordinator and leader of that  <br/>
group, through no planning, will or judgment of my own.  The original  <br/>
intended director never showed up.  I accepted the task tentatively  <br/>
at first and strongly after a while, and other people relied on me.   <br/>
And I needed to run it in such a way that they wanted to come back,  <br/>
because its impossible for one person to run a madrigal group when  <br/>
there&#39;s no group to run.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m used to group activities and inter-dependencies and  <br/>
assistances.   I think it&#39;s good and right and healthy.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the &quot;one&#39;s own will and judgement&quot; comes at the &quot;do I go on  <br/>
this road trip or not?&quot; or &quot;Do I go back and sing again or not?&quot;<br/>

company when Marty was in an accident and say &quot;Hey, it was your  <br/>
accident.&quot;  The insurance is in Keith&#39;s name.  So I could tell Keith  <br/>
he had to deal with it (and he did, actually, because he wanted to).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1575229670">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt; Is it possible that early on you seemed to grant her more rights than<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; you had the power to grant? &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a possibility and I have been doing a lot of re-examination of our <br/>
actions recently. Maybe I have been getting caught up in expectations or <br/>
some vision of how Jayn *should be* developing and her maturity level. As <br/>
she gets older, and I have clearer memories of my own life at her age, those <br/>
noisy mental tapes are coming back in force.<br/>
<br/>
However on the opposite side of this is my tendency to be overly concerned <br/>
about the feelings of other people and overly worried about other people&#39;s <br/>
opinions. I have written about this before. I have what might be an <br/>
excessively conservative idea about other people&#39;s boundaries and may be <br/>
advising caution to Jayn beyond what is reasonable, and she has both <br/>
experience and observation to tell her that I am being too worried (which <br/>
she translates as &quot;mean&quot; to her). A long time ago I wrote about the energy I <br/>
invested in helping her be quiet at night - this is entirely for the peace <br/>
of our neighbor. I think what I have is a gulf between my expectations and <br/>
what I insist upon from Jayn in the world and in dealing with others <br/>
(despite insisting with respect if that makes sense) and the extreme <br/>
relaxation of her life at home.<br/>
<br/>
When I referred to Jayn finding the line between her autonomy and her <br/>
community I should have been clearer. I was talking about our family, her <br/>
immediate community. The fact is that when Jayn is out at other people&#39;s <br/>
homes or in public places she is generally very pleasant and courteous. She <br/>
isn&#39;t making unreasonable demands. In public places like the YMCA where we <br/>
swim, she accepts the rules and complies generally cheerfully. When visiting <br/>
homes she takes her cues from the host children most of the time, and <br/>
follows rules, sometimes sharing with me later how odd they are in her view. <br/>
In playing she is much less bossy sounding than she used to be, as I listen <br/>
to her play, far more flexible. Although she sometimes gets locked into <br/>
pre-conceived plans or expectations of others, she is getting better about <br/>
hearing my warnings and suggestions and at dealing with disappointment. The <br/>
last L&L conference was the scene of some real growth for her in that area.<br/>
<br/>
No, all the areas where James and I are feeling challenged by Jayn&#39;s <br/>
attitude and behavior are towards us and in our home. She has been so very <br/>
sweet the last 10 days or so that I&#39;m having trouble coming up with an <br/>
example, and I know that so much of her emotional volatility is mirroring <br/>
mine at different times. This coincides with a period when we have been on <br/>
our nights and as we came out our neighbors were ill (and we don&#39;t play with <br/>
sick kids if we can avoid them), so we have been spending a lot of time <br/>
together just her and I, reading, writing, sewing, drawing, playing card <br/>
games, playing our new Wii, playing Agatha Christie and Nancy Drew computer <br/>
games and swimming at the YMCA. Lots of my undivided focus. Is there a <br/>
connection? Maybe.<br/>
<br/>
I do know that when Jayn has been spending a lot of time with certain kids <br/>
or playing at other homes where there are a lot of rules and strictures she <br/>
comes home with more stress to release, and sometimes that takes the form of <br/>
insisting on her &quot;rights&quot; even when no-one is trying to remove them. It <br/>
seems like she is looking for a fight so she asks rudely and makes demands <br/>
that of course immediately get my back up and cause teeth gritting. This is <br/>
when I try to remember some of Joyce&#39;s wonderful writing about anger in <br/>
kids, &quot;Do you love me now, even now?&quot; and breathe.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m having a hard time treading the line between understanding where this is <br/>
coming from and my desire to impress on her that it is &quot;unacceptable&quot;, when <br/>
that latter mind set only makes things worse, feeding more negativity into a <br/>
stressed moment. When does &quot;impressing&quot; some idea on to someone else ever <br/>
work well? I have found that silence is best. Just looking at her sadly and <br/>
waiting a moment. She will generally wind down and apologise (unasked) and <br/>
tell me something about her feelings - usually expressed as &quot;tired&quot;, even <br/>
though I think it is closer to &quot;fed up&quot;. Yes, definitely just refraining <br/>
from making any comment at all in the heat of the moment is best - but I <br/>
have to remember to be still. Talking later in the calm about issues was <br/>
what worked best when she was little. I don&#39;t know when I shifted into being <br/>
this person who feels like I must immediately correct Jayn&#39;s behavior or <br/>
attitude or speech towards me. I think I need to revisit and return to the <br/>
happy strategies that worked to promote peace amongst us all when Jayn was <br/>
younger.<br/>

I don&#39;t really have an answer - but just was trying to think of how  <br/>

&gt; I think what I have is a gulf between my expectations and<br/>

&gt; relaxation of her life at home.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking how I tend to be much more tolerant of things my kids do <br/>
than their siblings. If my child is singing really loudly, I&#39;ll let <br/>
her - I&#39;m happy to let her. But a sister will often not hesitate to <br/>
say, &quot;Hey, too loud.&quot; Jayn has no sibling &quot;setting her straight&quot; and <br/>
does have her very very relaxed and tolerant and adoring parents at <br/>
home who don&#39;t ever have to intervene between her and a sibling and <br/>
help them find ways to tolerate each other&#39;s annoying behaviors.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t really have an answer - but just was trying to think of how <br/>
this played out in my house and I think the difference is that there <br/>
were always three kids versus one, so it there wasn&#39;t as much contrast <br/>
between the outside world and our in-home world.<br/>

&gt; There is one cool toy.  I wouldn&#39;t say &quot;math&quot; or if you do, don&#39;t  <br/>
&gt; talk about numbers much.<br/>

discovered other fun ways to play, such as drawing an animal so that <br/>
it appears that many animals are chasing one another (or people, etc.) <br/>
Snowflakes are an obvious idea, but squiggles and boxes and anything <br/>
repeated multiple times takes on a whole new feel of fun! Thanks for <br/>
this link!<br/>
