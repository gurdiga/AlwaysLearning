<div id="ygrps-yiv-699421535">-=- I don&#39;t know that I share your zeal for proselytizing unschooling  <br/>
although I do enjoy sharing and promoting unschooling and respectful  <br/>
parenting.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
Someone wrote this to me on the side.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Proselytizing&quot; doesn&#39;t sound at all like what I do to  me.  I don&#39;t  <br/>
like to be interviewed because I don&#39;t trust the journalists to  <br/>
understand well enough to describe unschooling accurately.  I don&#39;t  <br/>
go to regular homeschooling lists and say &quot;You should unschool  <br/>
instead.&quot;   When the internet was in its awkward infancy and there  <br/>
weren&#39;t pages or e-mail lists, just newsgroups, and all the  <br/>
homeschoolers were lumped together in one group on *Prodigy, I  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t say &quot;Unschooling is GREAT!,&quot; but I would respond when others  <br/>
said &quot;If they&#39;re not made to read, they&#39;ll never read.&quot;  I would say  <br/>
&quot;I know kids who are reading who weren&#39;t made to read,&quot; or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Proselytizing is going out to people who didn&#39;t want to know.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m staying in a place (my website, here, UnschoolingDiscussion list  <br/>
on google) where people can find me.  It&#39;s more like an office.   <br/>
People can look for these discussions or those pages, and they can  <br/>
come here, but I don&#39;t chase them down or invite them over with  <br/>
billboards or flyers on doors.<br/>
<br/>
When people are here, I assume they came to discuss unschooling in a  <br/>
serious way.   The fact that I prefer serious, honest discussions  <br/>
might seem like &quot;proselytizing.&quot;  I see it as integrity and  <br/>
consideration for not wasting people&#39;s time or energy.<br/>
<br/>
On Unschooling Discussion someone posted this in response to another  <br/>
mom who&#39;s new there (and hostile and resistant) (from line to line is  <br/>
the quoted part):<br/>
===========================================<br/>
On this the list a while back I posted how I was late all the time  <br/>
for my daughters ballets lessons ( and I know your daughter is in  <br/>
similar lessons with RAD so maybe you can relate) and I ended up in  <br/>
big fight with ballet teacher.<br/>
<br/>
I came to the list for advice on how I could better handle the  <br/>
situation which got ugle for other reasons.  I think in part  I  <br/>
wanted to be validated- &quot;oh what an awful teacher, how dare she  <br/>
criticize you, blah blah blah.&quot; I don�t think I consciously wanted to  <br/>
hear that. but in hindsight I think I wanted to be validated.<br/>
<br/>
I know on several homeschool/unschool lists I would have gotten that-  <br/>
&quot;don&#39;t be so hard on yourself&quot; , etc.<br/>
<br/>
On this list- what makes it different- is that you don�t get away  <br/>
with that kind of thinking. Sandra mentioned in one of her posts to  <br/>
me something like &quot;It is your JOB to get your daughter to where she  <br/>
needs to go.&quot;  Those words struck me right to the heart and I admit I  <br/>
was quite depressed for a few days- she was right. I felt terrible  <br/>
because she was right and I realized I had been letting my children  <br/>
down.<br/>
<br/>
That was several months ago and that day I  did a complete  about  <br/>
face - we now get there a half hour early 4X a week. There is no more  <br/>
rushing or untidy bun. I can SEE the difference in her attitude- that  <br/>
I take her desire to be there seriously  and that lifts her spirit  <br/>
and maintains her self worth.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I would have gotten that type of advice on another  <br/>
list. Maybe it being put so bluntly made me really think about what  <br/>
was said more  than I would have if I had to  wade through sugar  <br/>
coated opinions to figure out the meaning. Maybe not<br/>
At any rate there is a saying &quot;principles before personalities&quot;  <br/>
meaning take the principle behind what the person as saying and don�t  <br/>
let their personality get in the way of receiving the message.<br/>
=======================================<br/>
<br/>
There are MANY other lists where the goal is to sit and write  <br/>
whatever comes to mind, to other people who are going to read it  <br/>
lightly and write whatever comes to mind.  The few lists I&#39;m on that  <br/>
are that way pretty much bug the crap out of me, because it IS a  <br/>
waste of time and energy, but some people like the mindless chit-chat  <br/>
and the cooing and &quot;support&quot; and camaraderie.  In some cases it can  <br/>
lead to real friendships, but in more cases it&#39;s fluff and noise.  I  <br/>
stay because under 20 messages might be one piece of information I  <br/>
actually needed.<br/>
<br/>
-=--=- I don&#39;t know that I share your zeal for proselytizing  <br/>
unschooling although I do enjoy sharing and promoting unschooling and  <br/>
respectful parenting.<br/>
-=--=-<br/>
<br/>
I think what I&#39;m doing is sharing and promoting unschooling and  <br/>
respectful parenting.  I spend money (I pay for webspace and support  <br/>
and I got full photobucket so I can upload, store and link graphics  <br/>
better than I could on the website I&#39;m already paying for.  It&#39;s not  <br/>
huge amounts of money, and It seems totally worth it to me to have  <br/>
things where I can just send people links when they ask.  It&#39;s like  <br/>
any volunteer work or community service, only I can do it from home  <br/>
and still be with my kids.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway...  I think proselytizing is trying to bring everyone into one  <br/>
fold, and I don&#39;t think unschooling is for everyone.  I think  <br/>
unschooling is for very few and it&#39;s easy to screw it up.  Some  <br/>
people say &quot;Anyone can unschool,&quot; and I&#39;ve never ever heard or read  <br/>
those words without thinking (and sometimes saying) &quot;No they can&#39;t.&quot;   <br/>
And some people say &quot;You&#39;ve been unschooling since your baby was  <br/>
born!&quot; and that&#39;s nonsense.   Those who like to think there&#39;s nothing  <br/>
to it are going to take longer to get it going well than those who  <br/>
actively try to adjust their lives and homes and thinking to get that  <br/>
learning flow running, and to get ideas and communications swirling.   <br/>
I&#39;m willing to help people do that, because it was harder for me to  <br/>
get going than it needs to be now, with the internet and e-mail  <br/>
lists.  I like to help make it easier for those who want to do it,  <br/>
but I&#39;m not off trying to convert the heathen.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-924925585">I had written this:<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think unschooling is for everyone.  I think<br/>
unschooling is for very few and it&#39;s easy to screw it up.  Some<br/>
people say &quot;Anyone can unschool,&quot; and I&#39;ve never ever heard or read<br/>
those words without thinking (and sometimes saying) &quot;No they can&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
By e-mail, someone wrote this, and I said I&#39;d answer online instead  <br/>
of there.  After I had written that, I found a really cool pair of  <br/>
graphics that show clearly why unschooling will work GREAT for some  <br/>
people and probably not work at all for others.  If I had answered  <br/>
the question right away, I&#39;d&#39;ve had no pictures to show for it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
======================<br/>
<br/>
How does one know if they can do it or not?  How does a person know  <br/>
if unschooling is right for one&#39;s family or not?<br/>
<br/>
If not everyone can do it, then does that mean that some who think  <br/>
they are unschooling are actually not and thus potentially harming  <br/>
their children?<br/>
<br/>
  I mean, if I thought I was unschooling my kids and years later  <br/>
discovered I wasn&#39;t actually unschooling, and my kids had learned  <br/>
nothing, that would seem to be doing them a disservice.   Yet I read  <br/>
that kids (everyone) learns all the time, from life, so anything they  <br/>
do can be thought of as a &quot;learning experience.&quot;  How can a person  <br/>
fail at unschooling? Is it so hard?<br/>
==================================================================<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll answer them backwards.  The third one...<br/>
<br/>
-=- I read that kids (everyone) learns all the time, from life, so  <br/>
anything they do can be thought of as a &quot;learning experience.&quot;  How  <br/>
can a person fail at unschooling? -=-<br/>
<br/>
A parent can fail at unschooling by being<br/>
critical<br/>
negative<br/>
exasperated<br/>
selfish<br/>
bored<br/>
boring<br/>
depressed<br/>
depressing<br/>
cheap<br/>
lazy<br/>
insulting<br/>
pessimistic<br/>
cynical<br/>
unwilling to change<br/>
more concerned about their own mothers&#39; opinions than about being  <br/>
their children&#39;s best mother<br/>
<br/>
If the parents consider their children&#39;s interests to be &quot;stupid,&quot;  <br/>
unschooling will be stunted at best, at their house.<br/>
If the parents are unschooling because they think it will be less  <br/>
expensive and take less time and effort, they won&#39;t be good unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Children learn from things they feel happy and good and hopeful  <br/>
about.  From other things, they learn to stop trusting, stop trying,  <br/>
avoid learning.<br/>
<br/>
-=-How can a person fail at unschooling? Is it so hard?-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s harder to fail than to succeed.  People do it all the time.   <br/>
They say &quot;We used to unschool&quot; but when pressed for details, it&#39;s  <br/>
sometimes no more than one semester they quit their curriculum early,  <br/>
or they used to only require math and reading, but that wasn&#39;t  <br/>
working so they went back to a curriculum.  There are people who  <br/>
&quot;give it a try&quot; for a month and decide it didn&#39;t work.  There are  <br/>
people who are unwilling to even look into the idea of deschooling,  <br/>
so they walk around with an emergency-option school on their backs,  <br/>
and in their heads.  They live in the shadow of school.  They compare  <br/>
everything their kids do or don&#39;t do to an idealized vision of what  <br/>
the child would do if he were in school, or to a theoretical model of  <br/>
the ideal school kid.<br/>
<br/>
-=-If not everyone can do it, then does that mean that some who think  <br/>
they are unschooling are actually not and thus potentially harming  <br/>
their children?-=-<br/>
<br/>
If the children are unhappy, and the parents aren&#39;t thinking of fun,  <br/>
creative, surprising and interesting things to do, the kids might be  <br/>
better off in school.  School potentially harms people.  If the  <br/>
parents can do better than school in so many ways that the kids  <br/>
really would rather be home doing cooler things, then the parents  <br/>
probably can unschool.  If the parents want to expend the lowest  <br/>
possible effort and spend more time thinking &quot;Anything&#39;s better than  <br/>
school&quot; instead of &quot;How can we make every single day fun and  <br/>
memorable?&quot; then they probably shouldn&#39;t bother to try to unschool.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I mean, if I thought I was unschooling my kids and years later  <br/>
discovered I wasn&#39;t actually unschooling, and my kids had learned  <br/>
nothing, that would seem to be doing them a disservice.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
It would be a disservice to all unschoolers, too, to call neglect  <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
Would it really take YEARS to discover kid weren&#39;t learning and  <br/>
weren&#39;t happy?<br/>
<br/>
So... those graphs:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.learningandteaching.info/learning/pask.htm#serialists">http://www.learningandteaching.info/learning/pask.htm#serialists</a><br/>
<br/>
The second, scattery/holistic model, is how I&#39;ve described  <br/>
unschooling over the years.  If people pick up all kinds of  <br/>
knowledge, and start making the connections, it&#39;s easier to add  <br/>
things in between those things.<br/>
<br/>
Some people can do both, or are some balance between the two, or it  <br/>
depends on the topic...   If everyone in a family is genetically a  <br/>
&quot;serialist&quot; then unschooling isn&#39;t going to work for them.  If the  <br/>
parents are and the child isn&#39;t, the child can probably learn in  <br/>
spite of them.  If the parents are holistic and the child is a  <br/>
serialist, the child can still learn from books and lists and such,  <br/>
and will probably still pick up cool ideas from the swirl of the  <br/>
holistically-still-learning-and-connecting parents.<br/>
<br/>
In a family (such as my own) in which every single person is happy to  <br/>
gather information in all kinds of ways and make those connections,  <br/>
unschooling works pretty effortlessly.<br/>

<br/>
How can a person  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; fail at unschooling? Is it so hard?<br/>

continued to read, A lot of what was written seemed to describe my <br/>
picture of me. Am I one of the ones who shouldn&#39;t unschool?<br/>

because I feel I have now become aware That I do project these <br/>
traits and am wanting to change and am actively trying to find ways <br/>
to do this. However, it seems like a very long process. My ds has <br/>
just turned 12, does he have time as for me to go through this <br/>
process? I see the same type of reactions in him. His biological <br/>
father was a angry, critical person too. Am I doing more damage than <br/>
good trying to unschool him while I work on these issues I have? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; more concerned about their own mothers&#39; opinions than about being  <br/>
&gt; their children&#39;s best mother<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote> this one i have recently gotten over. I think that&#39;s progress. I <br/>
just gave her the links to several unschooling websites and told her <br/>
this is what we are doing. I have defended homeschooling so much to <br/>
my extended family,I didn&#39;t want to even think about defending <br/>
unschooling. Although, as I read this comment again, I don&#39;t think I <br/>
was really concerned about their opinions, just the backlash I had <br/>
to deal with because of them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; If the parents consider their children&#39;s interests to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>be &quot;stupid,&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
At first, I think this described my feeling about some of their <br/>
pursuits somewhat. I don&#39;t think &quot;stupid&quot; is the right word though. <br/>
I can&#39;t think of the right word, but I felt, and still do at times, <br/>
feel like certain things such as TV and video games don&#39;t really <br/>
have much value. The I thinkabout some of the thing smy DS comes up <br/>
with and when I ask &quot;where did you learn that&quot; his answer is <br/>
discovery kids or somethign similar. DD, however, only watches <br/>
disney or charmed. I think this is where I am truly wonderign about <br/>
the value. The she will come up with some tidbit of info that seem <br/>
valuable that was gleened forn one of these shows. It&#39;s a constant <br/>
internal conflict of mine. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Children learn from things they feel happy and good and hopeful  <br/>
&gt; about. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do think my angry,, critical nature has definately affected this.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 From other things, they learn to stop trusting, stop trying,  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; avoid learning.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I tried to be so open with my DS and DD. hoping that they would grow <br/>
up to be able to trust in me and come to me wit whatever they needed <br/>
to. I hav recently discovered that my DS fells like he can&#39;t tell me <br/>
anything or he&#39;ll &quot;get in trouble&quot;. I dont feel like he is avoiding <br/>
learning though. He does like to come show me his creations and <br/>
things he has found that interest him. He has said that he is glad <br/>
he can coem to me and share his interestes. I guess it is realy the <br/>
negative feelings that he feels he can not share with me or &quot;he&#39;ll <br/>
get in trouble&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ok, we&#39;ve been homeschoolign for 3 years. when we first started I <br/>
had a mish-mosh of different shoolish books. Lasted for 3 weeks. <br/>
Then I found out about unschooling. The beginning of this &quot;school&quot; <br/>
year I got panicky. My DS doesn&#39;t know the math that school kids <br/>
know. I hear about this all the time from my Grandmother, teacher <br/>
for 60 years.  So we tried a Charlotte mason approach. Taht lasted <br/>
until november. We were liking all the reading, then we moved and <br/>
haven&#39;t started reading again. They didn&#39;t like some of the other <br/>
aspects of it and we haven&#39;t gone back. We are out in the country <br/>
and the kids  are really liking exploring and playing outside. I do <br/>
think we would all liketo go back to doign soemof the reading <br/>
though. DD still spells phonetically. She would be in 4th grade this <br/>
year. This does bother her, so I am trying to help out by strewing <br/>
spelling type things. We have recently gotten Boggle and she has <br/>
jsut gotten an internet pen pal. Both of these she likes, but seems <br/>
to give up so easily because of her spelling skills.<br/>
<br/>
There are  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; people who are unwilling to even look into the idea of <br/>
 </span></blockquote>deschooling,  <br/>
<br/>
I think we have been doing this for 3 years and it is still ongoing. <br/>
Does it really take this long and longer?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>of  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the ideal school kid.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We are constantly hearing concerns from extended family so this is <br/>
in the back of my head. I usually don&#39;t think about it unless <br/>
someone else brings it up, which is often. This is one of the <br/>
reasons I think we are still deschooling. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; their children?-=-<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So am I one of the ones that just thinks I am unschooling, but am <br/>
really just pretending and doing more harm than good?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; If the children are unhappy, and the parents aren&#39;t thinking of <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; creative, surprising and interesting things to do, the kids might <br/>
 </span></blockquote>be  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; better off in school. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think I am getting better at this. I am sitting down to play more <br/>
games with them. I have finally decided we waste enough money on <br/>
other thigns, I should just go ahead and let them do the activities <br/>
I have said no to in the past because i felt like we didn&#39;t have the <br/>
money. So  dd is taking cooking classes and Ice skating and LOVING <br/>
both of them.  Ds is in Boy Scouts and does every activity they come <br/>
up with. I feel liek we should get out more. I know they would like <br/>
to go to park day with our homeschool group more. And there is a <br/>
coop that they liek to go to on fridays. Buthow do you balance what <br/>
the kids want to do with what you need/want to do?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 School potentially harms people.  If the  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; parents can do better than school in so many ways that the kids  <br/>
&gt; really would rather be home doing cooler things, then the parents  <br/>
&gt; probably can unschool.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So what if they watch &quot;Charmed&quot; all day? Is that better or cooler <br/>
than being in school? I can say that when asked, they do not want to <br/>
go back to school. DS has, however, said he woudl like to try middle <br/>
school for a year, but changes his mind when he realizes he doesn&#39;t <br/>
know the same schoolish things that they do (i.e. mulitiplication <br/>
and division.<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;How can we make every single day fun and  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; memorable?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>EVERY single day? Waht about the day to day things that we have to <br/>
take time out for such as washing clothes and cooking and fixing <br/>
thigns arougn the house? And what about when mom has gone so much <br/>
she is exhausted but the kids still want to go?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It would be a disservice to all unschoolers, too, to call neglect  <br/>
&gt; unschooling.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sometimes I think I am being neglectful because I am not requiring <br/>
them to do anything. I guess that&#39;s a part of deschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Would it really take YEARS to discover kid weren&#39;t learning and  <br/>
&gt; weren&#39;t happy?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I see them learning things all the time. It may not be the times <br/>
tables or division or how to diagram a sentence, but I see ALL kinds <br/>
of learning!<br/>
<br/>
So I am wondering, am I one of the ones who should not unschool? Am <br/>
I failing at it?<br/>
<br/>

This is so much that I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t have time to reply to all of it.<br/>
<br/>
But I think that as long as children are having basic needs met, food, <br/>
shelter, and love, they are better off being unschooled.<br/>
<br/>
But again, not enough time to explain all this or make an argument for what <br/>
&quot;might&quot; be a are exception.<br/>
<br/>
Peace out,<br/>

&gt;I haven&#39;t read for a several days and as I was catching up I came<br/>
&gt;across this post and feel like I need to return to it. Some of the<br/>
&gt;thigns said here really struck a cord with me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;How can a person<br/>
&gt; &gt; fail at unschooling? Is it so hard?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;this is the line that really caught me attention. Then as I<br/>
&gt;continued to read, A lot of what was written seemed to describe my<br/>
&gt;picture of me. Am I one of the ones who shouldn&#39;t unschool?<br/>
&gt; &gt; ==================================================================<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; A parent can fail at unschooling by being<br/>
&gt; &gt; critical<br/>
&gt; &gt; negative<br/>
&gt; &gt; exasperated<br/>
&gt; &gt; selfish<br/>
&gt; &gt; bored<br/>
&gt; &gt; boring<br/>
&gt; &gt; depressed<br/>
&gt; &gt; depressing<br/>
&gt; &gt; cheap<br/>
&gt; &gt; lazy<br/>
&gt; &gt; insulting<br/>
&gt; &gt; pessimistic<br/>
&gt; &gt; cynical<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This, I think, describes me. I took out the &quot;unwilling to change&quot;<br/>
&gt;because I feel I have now become aware That I do project these<br/>
&gt;traits and am wanting to change and am actively trying to find ways<br/>
&gt;to do this. However, it seems like a very long process. My ds has<br/>
&gt;just turned 12, does he have time as for me to go through this<br/>
&gt;process? I see the same type of reactions in him. His biological<br/>
&gt;father was a angry, critical person too. Am I doing more damage than<br/>
&gt;good trying to unschool him while I work on these issues I have?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; more concerned about their own mothers&#39; opinions than about being<br/>
&gt; &gt; their children&#39;s best mother<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  this one i have recently gotten over. I think that&#39;s progress. I<br/>
&gt;just gave her the links to several unschooling websites and told her<br/>
&gt;this is what we are doing. I have defended homeschooling so much to<br/>
&gt;my extended family,I didn&#39;t want to even think about defending<br/>
&gt;unschooling. Although, as I read this comment again, I don&#39;t think I<br/>
&gt;was really concerned about their opinions, just the backlash I had<br/>
&gt;to deal with because of them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If the parents consider their children&#39;s interests to<br/>
&gt;be &quot;stupid,&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;At first, I think this described my feeling about some of their<br/>
&gt;pursuits somewhat. I don&#39;t think &quot;stupid&quot; is the right word though.<br/>
&gt;I can&#39;t think of the right word, but I felt, and still do at times,<br/>
&gt;feel like certain things such as TV and video games don&#39;t really<br/>
&gt;have much value. The I thinkabout some of the thing smy DS comes up<br/>
&gt;with and when I ask &quot;where did you learn that&quot; his answer is<br/>
&gt;discovery kids or somethign similar. DD, however, only watches<br/>
&gt;disney or charmed. I think this is where I am truly wonderign about<br/>
&gt;the value. The she will come up with some tidbit of info that seem<br/>
&gt;valuable that was gleened forn one of these shows. It&#39;s a constant<br/>
&gt;internal conflict of mine.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Children learn from things they feel happy and good and hopeful<br/>
&gt; &gt; about.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I do think my angry,, critical nature has definately affected this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  From other things, they learn to stop trusting, stop trying,<br/>
&gt; &gt; avoid learning.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I tried to be so open with my DS and DD. hoping that they would grow<br/>
&gt;up to be able to trust in me and come to me wit whatever they needed<br/>
&gt;to. I hav recently discovered that my DS fells like he can&#39;t tell me<br/>
&gt;anything or he&#39;ll &quot;get in trouble&quot;. I dont feel like he is avoiding<br/>
&gt;learning though. He does like to come show me his creations and<br/>
&gt;things he has found that interest him. He has said that he is glad<br/>
&gt;he can coem to me and share his interestes. I guess it is realy the<br/>
&gt;negative feelings that he feels he can not share with me or &quot;he&#39;ll<br/>
&gt;get in trouble&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; -=-How can a person fail at unschooling? Is it so hard?-=-<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It&#39;s harder to fail than to succeed.  People do it all the time.<br/>
&gt; &gt; They say &quot;We used to unschool&quot; but when pressed for details, it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; sometimes no more than one semester they quit their curriculum<br/>
&gt;early,<br/>
&gt; &gt; or they used to only require math and reading, but that wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; working so they went back to a curriculum.  There are people who<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;give it a try&quot; for a month and decide it didn&#39;t work.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ok, we&#39;ve been homeschoolign for 3 years. when we first started I<br/>
&gt;had a mish-mosh of different shoolish books. Lasted for 3 weeks.<br/>
&gt;Then I found out about unschooling. The beginning of this &quot;school&quot;<br/>
&gt;year I got panicky. My DS doesn&#39;t know the math that school kids<br/>
&gt;know. I hear about this all the time from my Grandmother, teacher<br/>
&gt;for 60 years.  So we tried a Charlotte mason approach. Taht lasted<br/>
&gt;until november. We were liking all the reading, then we moved and<br/>
&gt;haven&#39;t started reading again. They didn&#39;t like some of the other<br/>
&gt;aspects of it and we haven&#39;t gone back. We are out in the country<br/>
&gt;and the kids  are really liking exploring and playing outside. I do<br/>
&gt;think we would all liketo go back to doign soemof the reading<br/>
&gt;though. DD still spells phonetically. She would be in 4th grade this<br/>
&gt;year. This does bother her, so I am trying to help out by strewing<br/>
&gt;spelling type things. We have recently gotten Boggle and she has<br/>
&gt;jsut gotten an internet pen pal. Both of these she likes, but seems<br/>
&gt;to give up so easily because of her spelling skills.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There are<br/>
&gt; &gt; people who are unwilling to even look into the idea of<br/>
&gt;deschooling,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think we have been doing this for 3 years and it is still ongoing.<br/>
&gt;Does it really take this long and longer?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; so they walk around with an emergency-option school on their<br/>
&gt;backs,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and in their heads.  They live in the shadow of school.  They<br/>
&gt;compare<br/>
&gt; &gt; everything their kids do or don&#39;t do to an idealized vision of<br/>
&gt;what<br/>
&gt; &gt; the child would do if he were in school, or to a theoretical model<br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt; &gt; the ideal school kid.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We are constantly hearing concerns from extended family so this is<br/>
&gt;in the back of my head. I usually don&#39;t think about it unless<br/>
&gt;someone else brings it up, which is often. This is one of the<br/>
&gt;reasons I think we are still deschooling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; -=-If not everyone can do it, then does that mean that some who<br/>
&gt;think<br/>
&gt; &gt; they are unschooling are actually not and thus potentially<br/>
&gt;harming<br/>
&gt; &gt; their children?-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So am I one of the ones that just thinks I am unschooling, but am<br/>
&gt;really just pretending and doing more harm than good?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If the children are unhappy, and the parents aren&#39;t thinking of<br/>
&gt;fun,<br/>
&gt; &gt; creative, surprising and interesting things to do, the kids might<br/>
&gt;be<br/>
&gt; &gt; better off in school.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think I am getting better at this. I am sitting down to play more<br/>
&gt;games with them. I have finally decided we waste enough money on<br/>
&gt;other thigns, I should just go ahead and let them do the activities<br/>
&gt;I have said no to in the past because i felt like we didn&#39;t have the<br/>
&gt;money. So  dd is taking cooking classes and Ice skating and LOVING<br/>
&gt;both of them.  Ds is in Boy Scouts and does every activity they come<br/>
&gt;up with. I feel liek we should get out more. I know they would like<br/>
&gt;to go to park day with our homeschool group more. And there is a<br/>
&gt;coop that they liek to go to on fridays. Buthow do you balance what<br/>
&gt;the kids want to do with what you need/want to do?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  School potentially harms people.  If the<br/>
&gt; &gt; parents can do better than school in so many ways that the kids<br/>
&gt; &gt; really would rather be home doing cooler things, then the parents<br/>
&gt; &gt; probably can unschool.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So what if they watch &quot;Charmed&quot; all day? Is that better or cooler<br/>
&gt;than being in school? I can say that when asked, they do not want to<br/>
&gt;go back to school. DS has, however, said he woudl like to try middle<br/>
&gt;school for a year, but changes his mind when he realizes he doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;know the same schoolish things that they do (i.e. mulitiplication<br/>
&gt;and division.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  &quot;How can we make every single day fun and<br/>
&gt; &gt; memorable?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;EVERY single day? Waht about the day to day things that we have to<br/>
&gt;take time out for such as washing clothes and cooking and fixing<br/>
&gt;thigns arougn the house? And what about when mom has gone so much<br/>
&gt;she is exhausted but the kids still want to go?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It would be a disservice to all unschoolers, too, to call neglect<br/>
&gt; &gt; unschooling.<br/>
&gt;Sometimes I think I am being neglectful because I am not requiring<br/>
&gt;them to do anything. I guess that&#39;s a part of deschooling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Would it really take YEARS to discover kid weren&#39;t learning and<br/>
&gt; &gt; weren&#39;t happy?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I see them learning things all the time. It may not be the times<br/>
&gt;tables or division or how to diagram a sentence, but I see ALL kinds<br/>
&gt;of learning!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So I am wondering, am I one of the ones who should not unschool? Am<br/>
&gt;I failing at it?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thasnk for listenign to my inarticulate ramblings,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sandra once wrote about what she learned watching episode after episode of<br/>
Gilligan&#39;s Island when she was younger. She talked about noticing the<br/>
geography, how the set was designed, wondering about where the island was,<br/>
how the camera angles were used (I think I&#39;m remembering this right...it<br/>
could have been more than Sandra that contributed to that thread) and that<br/>
really resonated with me because I had the same experience with Gilligan&#39;s<br/>
Island...I watched every episode many times. My parents thought it was a<br/>
waste of time and let me know it. I continued to watch, but did so at that<br/>
point with a bit of shame, because now I thought that what I was doing was<br/>
irresponsible and bad. But I loved the show! I remember being entranced with<br/>
the stereotyped characters (the Howells were the first rich people I had<br/>
ever seen, and Ginger, well, gosh, before her I didn&#39;t think anybody really<br/>
could have been glamorous like that [or shallow :o)]. So even though they<br/>
weren&#39;t real people, and I knew that, I did learn a bit about the<br/>
possibilities...someone could spend their time looking beautiful and<br/>
modeling, someone could actually have so much money they paid for people to<br/>
do even the simplest of tasks for them. I was really quite enmeshed in that<br/>
show, and it was a really important thing for me at the time. I internally<br/>
got a lot out of it. If I was forced to go play outside, I probably would<br/>
have tried to watch it through a window.<br/>
<br/>
So the point is, what is meaningless to you is a separate thing entirely<br/>
from what is meaningful to your children. And if you inflict your negative<br/>
opinion onto something they love, it will get in the way of your<br/>
relationship, and take away an opportunity to enjoy something together.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Buthow do you balance what<br/>
&gt;&gt;the kids want to do with what you need/want to do?&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Kids first as much as possible. Start with a &quot;yes&quot; to questions asked, and<br/>
then qualify it if you have to with &quot;as soon as I...(put gas in the car,<br/>
finish my bagel, circulate the laundry)&quot;. I have found having an attitude of<br/>
&quot;yes&quot; to be a great tool in unschooling. There really isn&#39;t a whole lot to<br/>
say an absolute &quot;no&quot; to.<br/>
<br/>
Also, there is little that I &quot;need&quot; or even want at this point in my life<br/>
that takes away from my kids...because what I really want above all else is<br/>
to have a healthy, lasting, trusting relationship with each one of my<br/>
children. The reading, the movie-watching, the massage, the conversing on<br/>
the phone, really can all wait until my kids aren&#39;t around as much. I do get<br/>
to do these things on occasion, but I really try to do it around my kids&#39;<br/>
needs/wants. My older kids are already starting to be gone more and I do<br/>
have much more freedom than ever before in my parenting. Sidenote: my almost<br/>
17 yo just said yesterday, &quot;Mom, I&#39;m going to college but I&#39;m going to live<br/>
at home and not build up debt and live with you guys for a long time. Just<br/>
letting you know.&quot; YES!!!! I SO hope that that is how it turns out, as he is<br/>
just such a good friend of mine. But I am also ready for him to decide<br/>
otherwise, if he wants, as he gets older. I think it is telling though, that<br/>
he would even say such a thing at an age that is typically known for<br/>
rebelling and kids counting the days until they can leave home.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;So what if they watch &quot;Charmed&quot; all day? Is that better or cooler<br/>

watched it with her...with an appreciative attitude? That behavior will<br/>
strengthen your relationship.<br/>

&gt;&gt;take time out for such as washing clothes and cooking and fixing<br/>
&gt;&gt;thigns arougn the house?&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe those things don&#39;t always have to be done when you think they do?<br/>
Maybe putting out there &quot;We can do such and such (what they want), but I am<br/>
wondering how people will have clean clothes tomorrow. Any ideas?&quot; See what<br/>
they say...I bet they get involved in that problem-solving, and you may even<br/>
have eager participants to help. You may learn that they don&#39;t even want<br/>
clean clothes tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
I would also suggest that the activities you list above could be seen as<br/>
fun, and could be done pleasantly and invitingly, a time to share together,<br/>
rather than as chores. And the little things that you do around the house<br/>
CAN be memorable...we just played dirty sock ball as we were loading up the<br/>
laundry...THAT will be memorable (for me at least :ol ), and was part of a<br/>
regular ordinary daily activity.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;And what about when mom has gone so much<br/>
&gt;&gt;she is exhausted but the kids still want to go?&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it is okay to say when you&#39;re exhausted, if that is truly the case.<br/>
If kids are supported and get to do things they are interested lots of the<br/>
time, they are pretty supportive back when you need it.<br/>
<br/>
I admire your honesty in looking at what is working for you and not in<br/>
unschooling.<br/>

People can get addicted to their negativity.<br/>
People sometimes have friends who will drag them back down.  It&#39;s  <br/>
almost like with drugs or alcohol.  If what friends to together is  <br/>
piss and moan and laugh at other people and belittle things, one can  <br/>

Those issues you have are like the air that you breath.  If he goes  <br/>

start changing now, if you want to change.<br/>

<br/>
If you need to appease them, then you need to.  Some people are more  <br/>
separate from their families than others, either emotionally or  <br/>
physically or legally.  There are many factors that can preclude  <br/>
unschooling--hostile ex husbands or other parents in the equation,  <br/>
money and living space...  No one has a &quot;right to unschool.&quot;  It&#39;s  <br/>
something a family will need to work out the same way they would need  <br/>
to work out sending the kids to an expensive boarding school, or  <br/>
owning llamas, or a yacht.<br/>
<br/>
If someone from a longtime vegetarian family wanted to open a  <br/>
steakhouse, he would be dealing with family backlash.   People just  <br/>
need to decide their priorities, and if  unschooling is high on the  <br/>
list, they need to arrange what needs to be arranged.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-295676839">-=-Ok, we&#39;ve been homeschoolign for 3 years. when we first started I<br/>
had a mish-mosh of different shoolish books. Lasted for 3 weeks.<br/>
Then I found out about unschooling. The beginning of this &quot;school&quot;<br/>
year I got panicky. My DS doesn&#39;t know the math that school kids<br/>
know. I hear about this all the time from my Grandmother, teacher<br/>
for 60 years. So we tried a Charlotte mason approach. Taht lasted<br/>
until november. We were liking all the reading, then we moved and<br/>
haven&#39;t started reading again. They didn&#39;t like some of the other<br/>
aspects of it and we haven&#39;t gone back.-=-<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re going back and forth, because you don&#39;t have faith in natural  <br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I do<br/>
think we would all liketo go back to doign soemof the reading<br/>
though. DD still spells phonetically. She would be in 4th grade this<br/>
year. This does bother her, so I am trying to help out by strewing<br/>
spelling type things. We have recently gotten Boggle and she has<br/>
jsut gotten an internet pen pal. Both of these she likes, but seems<br/>
to give up so easily because of her spelling skills.-=-<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re pushing spelling.  She&#39;s 9?  10?  Let her do fun things, not  <br/>
&quot;spelling things.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You want to go back to doing some of the reading?<br/>
You&#39;re looking at books or a list or an ideal instead of your children.<br/>
<br/>
-=-There are<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; people who are unwilling to even look into the idea of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>deschooling,<br/>
<br/>
-=-I think we have been doing this for 3 years and it is still ongoing.<br/>
Does it really take this long and longer?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Deschooling begins when school ends, and not a moment before.  You  <br/>
keep schooling.  you want to go back now.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/deschooling">http://sandradodd.com/deschooling</a><br/>
<br/>
Please do read that deschooling link, and those it links to.  It will  <br/>
help more than anything else, I think.<br/>
<br/>
-=-So am I one of the ones that just thinks I am unschooling, but am<br/>
really just pretending and doing more harm than good?-=-<br/>
<br/>
This sounds kind of accusatory and defensive and negative.<br/>
<br/>
If what you&#39;re doing is half-hearted and unsettled, are you &quot;really  <br/>
just pretending&quot;? Do you think you are unschooling or are you full-on  <br/>
unschooling?   There&#39;s a whole range os possibility, it&#39;s not just  <br/>
&quot;is&quot; or &quot;isn&#39;t.&quot;  It will be learning all the time, about how to do  <br/>
it better and more confidently.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I feel liek we should get out more. I know they would like<br/>
to go to park day with our homeschool group more. And there is a<br/>
coop that they liek to go to on fridays. Buthow do you balance what<br/>
the kids want to do with what you need/want to do?=-<br/>
<br/>
First do what you need to do for your kids, and with the leftover  <br/>
time take care of yourself.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/howto">http://sandradodd.com/howto</a><br/>
<br/>
-=-&quot;How can we make every single day fun and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; memorable?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>-=-EVERY single day? Waht about the day to day things that we have to<br/>
take time out for such as washing clothes and cooking and fixing<br/>
thigns arougn the house? And what about when mom has gone so much<br/>
she is exhausted but the kids still want to go?-=-<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t take 24 hours to  make a day fun or memorable. It takes  <br/>
something fun or memorable.<br/>
<br/>
How many days would you like to aim for if &quot;EVERY&quot; it too many for  <br/>
you?  How many days are you willing to let go while your children are  <br/>
young?  You won&#39;t get those days back.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Sometimes I think I am being neglectful because I am not requiring<br/>
them to do anything. I guess that&#39;s a part of deschooling.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think you have a wrong idea of deschooling, but you&#39;ll be reading  <br/>
that stuff again, right? &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
-=-Please explain your thoughts here more.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It sounded as though you were asking us whether it was worth  <br/>
changing, as he&#39;s already however-old he is.<br/>
<br/>
It seemed to me to be a question designed to justify not changing  <br/>
because there wasn&#39;t enough time.<br/>
<br/>
Would you change if he died tomorrow?  Would you change if you knew  <br/>
he was going to die within a year?<br/>
Are you changing for him or yourself?<br/>
<br/>
These questions are not asked so you&#39;ll answer them on the list.   <br/>
They&#39;re asked so that you can consider them to help clarify your  <br/>
feelings and thoughts and intentions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-663364488">&quot;But how do you balance what the kids want to do with what you <br/>
need/want to do?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Given all the other things that you said, I would make sure that your <br/>
children&#39;s needs come first long enough for it to become a habit to see <br/>
them as being the MOST important needs that you have.<br/>
<br/>
What you want and need, needs to come after what your kids want and <br/>
need.  You need to put them first.  By doing that long enough, you will <br/>
see that their needs for you become less, because they are full.  <br/>
Sometimes when I feel like I need to do something just for me and it is <br/>
contradictory to what my kids need at the moment, I have to take myself <br/>
out of the room for a minute and give myself a little pep talk.  <br/>
<br/>
The idea that happy children have happy moms, generally because the mom <br/>
is doing something self fulfilling, is a copout.  Moms can be happy <br/>
being moms and find fulfillment being the best moms they can be.  In <br/>
shifting my perspective thusly, I actually find that I DO have more <br/>
time for myself because my kids aren&#39;t so needy of me.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-79144751">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; What you want and need, needs to come after what your kids want and <br/>
need.  You need to put them first. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
After a lot of thinking and writing over time about this kind of issue,<br/>
including trying to get my head around the idea that there need never be<br/>
conflicts in consensual living, that &quot;conflicting needs&quot; is a construct that<br/>
maintains adversarial thinking, I came to the realization that I only ever<br/>
have one need that is ever a problem.<br/>
<br/>
At one time I was talking about the concept of &quot;surrendering to Jayn&#39;s need&quot;<br/>
- as being a process of relinquishing of my less urgent/important need in<br/>
order to return to serenity - looking at it hierarchically. People<br/>
encouraged me to see the very idea of surrendering as intertwined with<br/>
living adversarially.<br/>
<br/>
I have come to realize that the greatest, the only, battle is within myself.<br/>
<br/>
Every time there was (is) an apparent conflict of needs between me and Jayn<br/>
(she wanted to run and hide, I wanted to &quot;feel she was safe&quot; - she wanted to<br/>
stay, I wanted to go - she wanted to go, I wanted to stay) every time I<br/>
start feeling that tension of powerlessness inside and believe that I can<br/>
successfully resolve it by choosing to give (or give in) to her by<br/>
surrendering to her desire or need, what I was and am really doing is simply<br/>
this:<br/>

Letting go of my need to control.<br/>
<br/>
Every time. It isn&#39;t about Jayn (or James) at all. It isn&#39;t about putting<br/>
them ahead. It is about freeing myself from my need to control.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1430616502">Someone wrote, seemingly in defense of a family in which cynicism and  <br/>
unhappiness were common, &quot;I think that as long as children are having  <br/>
basic needs met, food, shelter, and love, they are better off being  <br/>
unschooled.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Below is a quote from something Pam Sorooshian wrote, about wonder.    <br/>
It and several other things about appreciating wonder are here:   <br/>

------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m just recommending that people look at what their kids ARE doing  <br/>
and see if they can change their own thinking about it - see it in  <br/>
the best possible way. It doesn&#39;t change what they&#39;re doing, but it  <br/>
changes the &quot;tone&quot; in the home and that is so all-important it can&#39;t  <br/>
be overemphasized.<br/>
<br/>
I guess, to be honest, I don&#39;t think people who are negative,  <br/>
pessimistic, or cynical are going to make great unschooling parents  <br/>
and that if they know themselves to be that way, they owe it to their  <br/>
kids to work on being more positive, optimistic, and especially at  <br/>
not expressing even minimal scorn. They&#39;ll do better by choosing to  <br/>
be more child-like themselves, more filled with wonder at even little  <br/>
ordinary aspects of life.<br/>
<br/>
----------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
I agree with Pam that the tone in the home makes or breaks  <br/>
unschooling.  &quot;It is so all-important it can&#39;t be overemphasized.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There is no benefit to anyone here for a single person on this list  <br/>
to encourage a mom to settle for doing a wan and half-assed job when  <br/>
she can improve her own life and those of her children and  <br/>
grandchildren by taking steps to perk up and be better.<br/>
