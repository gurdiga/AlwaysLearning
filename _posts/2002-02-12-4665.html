<div id="ygrps-yiv-254785076">The following are some things said to me by my sil..she and I have been<br/>
discussing hm&#39;schooing..I usually stay away from this topic with family..but<br/>
it went pretty far this time. I was very upset over some of these last<br/>
things she said..mostly her comment that all hm&#39;school kids should be<br/>
&#39;monitered&#39; and &#39;tested&#39;.  I think my anger is clouding rational thought at<br/>
this point. I wish I could put things into words better. I doubt if I will<br/>
ever change her mind.. but still can&#39;t help but hope that something I say,<br/>
might cause her to pause and reconsider.. She has 2 kids..one is a 21 yo son<br/>
who graduated hs, has stumbled from job to job so far and a 19yo dd who is<br/>
attending a photography school out in SanFrancisco. They are a millitary<br/>
family who moved around a lot. Would any of you..care to comment and help me<br/>
out?<br/>

&quot; I really didnt miss the point, the public school system needs work.  I<br/>
prefer not to dwell on how the system failed, because I cant do anything<br/>
about the past, blaming history and the NEA doesnt correct the problem.<br/>
Those of you that chose an alternate form of education can&#39;t be absolved<br/>
from working to effect a change for those who dont have that option.   I<br/>
feel that a choice to home school is a wonderful option, and works well if<br/>
the parent and child are motivated.   But to run away from the system is<br/>
isolationism and believing that the world is all bad isn&#39;t a way to make the<br/>
world a better place.  It is most optimal to be on the School Board as an<br/>
individual, or to vote for the right people to be on the School Board rather<br/>
than to let it be taken over by &quot;subversives.&quot;  Voting for checks on the<br/>
teachers, being a volunteer in the schools (did you know that the Red Cross<br/>
trains teachers aides to be helpful in the classroom so that the teacher can<br/>
spend more time teaching and less time babysitting?)   There are so many<br/>
ways to help, and I have seen schools all across America that are wonderful,<br/>
caring places to send our children.  But what are you doing about the<br/>
problem? In the places where my kids went to school, I worked to better the<br/>
system and am still involved with that. I will try to be more active in<br/>
pursuing changes through political avenues, and will do all I can to stress<br/>
learning for my grandchildren. Ever the optimist, I believe that we can<br/>
effect a change if we work at it, and I am happy to say that not all corrupt<br/>
individuals get on the school board. Parents have every right to ask for<br/>
better education for their kids.  When the parents don&#39;t get involved, don&#39;t<br/>
listen to their kids about the bad teachers, and don&#39;t care, that is when<br/>
the schools break down.  Ultimately it is our obligation, when we bring<br/>
children into this world, to do the best that we can for them and take<br/>
responsibility for them.  Some of us don&#39;t have the time, because of the<br/>
need to make a living, or the abilities to teach, or even the inclination to<br/>
home school.  Often, because they feel that their children need more than<br/>
they can deliver.  So we go to PTA meetings, are active with the schools,<br/>
and take board positions.<br/>
<br/>
We (the American people) don&#39;t need to justify our choices in the way we<br/>
educate ourselves and our children. We just need to do the best we are able<br/>
to do. I have found that we can learn as much as we want to learn...my<br/>
optimism is showing here. It would be great if there was a perfect system,<br/>
but those who want to be educated can be, in spite of the system. And the<br/>
wonderful thing is that we and our children can choose to continue learning<br/>
all our life.  If we goofed up, we can try again and again.<br/>
<br/>
We may have a flawed public school system in some cases. Likewise, there are<br/>
some inherent flaws with the Home Schooling system.  For example, a lack of<br/>
constant monitoring to ensure progress is being made.  There should be<br/>
annual testing to ensure that the teaching is being accomplished so that the<br/>
children will stand a fighting chance when they enter the real world.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t feel qualified to take on the responsibility for teaching all the<br/>
diverse information that my kids need in these high-technology times. I<br/>
admire you for being confident enough to accept that awesome job.<br/>
<br/>
Lets hope that in the long run, in spite of us, in spite of our parents and<br/>
in spite of the system, our families will be happy and take responsibility<br/>
for the way they want to live. We make mistakes, we learn, we try, then we<br/>
trust that we all choose the right road.&quot;</div>

<br/>
Tell her in some states they are.<br/>
Just say something to her to shush her so she doesn&#39;t keep pounding you with <br/>
noise.<br/>
<br/>
When my mother in law said (in a restaurant, with all my kids at the table) <br/>
&quot;Do you get them tested?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How do you know they aren&#39;t behind?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I know they ARE behind in some things, and they&#39;re ahead in others.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It shut her up.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could just give your sister some general homeschooling sites to <br/>
read.  HEM, NHEN introductions online  (they&#39;re linked from <br/>
sandradodd.com/unschooling , down at the bottom--I don&#39;t learn them, I just <br/>
go click on my own links, sorry).  You could tell her that until she knows <br/>
more about it, she&#39;s wasting your time discussing it.  That if she wants to <br/>
do some research and THEN come talk to you, you&#39;ll talk.<br/>

<br/>
Yes.. I&#39;ve thought about saying something similar..as she obiviously isn&#39;t<br/>
really interested in how hm&#39;schooling works. I haven&#39;t the guts to even<br/>
mildly go into &#39;unschooling&#39; with her.. she would freak for sure. We have<br/>
side-stepped this for many years.. but I know she has always thought my kids<br/>
are &#39;behind&#39; hers..and will never have the opportunities for college and<br/>
stuff. I know it shouldn&#39;t matter, but it is hard for me with family. I&#39;ll<br/>
send her the links.. who knows, she may get curious enough to actually go<br/>
take a look.<br/>
Thanks<br/>

oh, and put me on the list for your idea cards and un-math book!!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1487605278">Why debate? :) She said:  &quot;We (the American people) don&#39;t need to justify our <br/>
choices in the way we educate ourselves and our children. We just need to do <br/>
the best we are able to do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Your reply? My suggestion is:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yes! Thank you for understanding.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Her letter reads less like an attack on your choice than a passionate defense <br/>
of her own. Your own mention of her son&#39;s shows it&#39;s a sticky point for her <br/>
in the family dynamics. Like most such family debates, the real issue isn&#39;t <br/>
ever just the words themselves. You&#39;re each defending (and seeing attacks on) <br/>
your own parenting. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s usually wisest, I think, just to stay out of the swamp altogether, by <br/>
neatly sidestepping whenever the other party lobs something over the fence. <br/>
Vague noncomittal responses are my preferred shield. &quot;Thank you for your <br/>
concern.&quot; &quot;Oh, that&#39;s interesting.&quot; and change the subject. (Chocolate works <br/>
for me)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Your probably right.. that I shouldn&#39;t try to change her mind. I am more<br/>
concerned now, because my middle daughter is wanting very much to spend a<br/>
week or two with this Aunt, and I&#39;m afraid she will try to convince our<br/>
daughter that she has &quot;missed out on so much by not going to school&quot;. So<br/>
when this conservation got started last week.. I thought it might be an<br/>
opportunity to discuss things and to possibly help her to understand alittle<br/>
of why/how we chose to keep our kids at home. My sil is really a very nice<br/>
person..just so different from us.  She has no idea that we are unschoolers.<br/>
My dd would be considered &#39;behind&#39; in some things (at least according to my<br/>
sil) This is the first time they have lived close enough to us to visit and<br/>
be around more. I&#39;m just trying to figure out how to deal with the new<br/>
circumstances.  This maybe wasn&#39;t the place for this type of discussion..do<br/>
appreciate your thoughts tho.<br/>

<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to tell the sister in law not to bug your daughter or <br/>
pressure her about homeschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
And you could coach your daughter with some answers (if she&#39;s worried about <br/>
it) so she could better defend herself.  You could send a book with her <br/>
during the visit so if the aunt starts anything the daughter could hand her <br/>
the book and say &quot;You could read this.&quot;<br/>

Of course it&#39;s the place for it. Where else?  :)<br/>
<br/>
Hey really, sorry I didn&#39;t have any brilliant ideas to change her mind for <br/>
you. In 13 years I&#39;ve never changed anyone&#39;s mind with just a few <br/>
conversations. I&#39;ve given people food for thought, and led people farther <br/>
down the road sometimes, but the only mind changing has come about over time <br/>
because my kids are turning out just fine.<br/>
<br/>
I think in situations where people you care about might hurt your children, <br/>
it&#39;s important to take an active approach. Address the issue head on if you <br/>
feel there might be tension during the visit. <br/>
<br/>
My mother used to quiz my kids and otherwise sabotage us. She meant well, but <br/>
it wasn&#39;t nice just the same. I told her to cut it out or she&#39;d not get to be <br/>
around them unsupervised. Before my daughter got on a plane for a long visit <br/>
I called my mom especially to tell her that my daughter was apprehensive <br/>
about the visit because she thought sometimes Oma thought her stupid. Oma <br/>
behaved better. That time, anyway. :)<br/>
