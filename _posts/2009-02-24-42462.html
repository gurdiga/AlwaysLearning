<div id="ygrps-yiv-1489988779">If he is 3 and you adopted him at 2 1/2 it has been only somewhere around or <br/>
a little more than 6 months.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think he has had enough time to truly feel full (of love and safety) <br/>
and to truly feel comfortable and trust that the food won&#39;t become <br/>
unavailable again. His body is reacting to plenty after famine.<br/>
<br/>
If telling him to stop is upsetting him, you are bringing an extra layer of <br/>
emotional discomfort that will be more static preventing him from hearing <br/>
his body&#39;s satiation cues.<br/>
<br/>
You are afraid that he will be overweight? He&#39;s three. You put out the <br/>
monkey platter how many times? But then you are upset that it got eaten.<br/>
<br/>
 Are you envisioning that he will be like an increasingly large vacuum <br/>
cleaner and the amount that he consumes will increase exponentially with his <br/>
growth, so that he ends up like Mr. Creosote?<br/>
<br/>
If he eats the whole platter, put out another.<br/>
If he is still eating, offer him more.<br/>
<br/>
You are worried about how much his food is costing. Can it really be so <br/>
much? I would caution you against having an attitude in your heart that he <br/>
is costing you &quot;too much&quot;. I think our subconcious thoughts or fears can be <br/>
clearer to those around us than we realize. I refer you to the epiphany I <br/>
just had yesterday (at the age of 47) about my mother&#39;s unspoken belief that <br/>
I was lazy. It wasn&#39;t that she said so to me, it was something internalized <br/>
that I somehow internalized as well over my youth and childhood.<br/>

<br/>
  By giving him a choice you are doing nothing wrong.  You are helping to<br/>
give him such extra structure and teaching him not to be excessive.  I would<br/>
have said yes to 2, but not all 3.  I am an adoptive parent as well and we<br/>
brought our oldest daughter home at 18 months.  At that time she was our<br/>
only child and we allowed her to have everything she could possibly want.<br/>
That&#39;s how she stayed overweight for about one year.  Then I saw that I<br/>
wasn&#39;t helping her to give into her every demand for food and started saying<br/>
no and helping to implement healthy choices.  She&#39;s almost 10 now and is a<br/>
healthy happy little girl who is very bonded to her Daddy and I.  Just<br/>
another perspective.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It won&#39;t be so awful if he gains some weight. Definitely don&#39;t let that <br/>
be an overriding concern. Instead, make sure he has lots of chance for <br/>
activity.<br/>
<br/>
My sister adopted a child with similar issues - seems not to be uncommon <br/>
for kids who have been really neglected and abused as babies/toddlers. <br/>
My sister did limit and restrict food and her daughter looked trim and <br/>
healthy during all of her childhood. She&#39;s 27 now and has gained a very <br/>
large amount of weight.<br/>
<br/>
Just saying....controlling his food intake now isn&#39;t going to keep him <br/>
healthy later, and it could very well backfire. How can he ever relax <br/>
around food and feel a sense of abundance if you don&#39;t let him?<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t promise that early food deprivation won&#39;t have any lasting <br/>
effect. But you can make it worse by continuing to create a sense of <br/>
deprivation.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Teaching him not to be excessive?&quot;<br/>
That&#39;s about teaching, and it defines a child wanting yogurt as  <br/>
&quot;excessive.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He wasn&#39;t asking for a box of Twinkies and half a gallon of ice  <br/>
cream.   And if he had?  (Probably nobody has a box of Twinkies  <br/>
onhand, but we usually have ice cream.  Nobody&#39;s ever eaten even a  <br/>
pint at once, let alone half a gallon.)<br/>

The phrasing there is very antagonistic.  I never &quot;give in&quot; to my  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1406438794">My godchild lived with me for a year and her mother limited food. I never said no to food yet she would still get up in the middle of the night to get food, hide it in her room etc. <br/>
<br/>
So i told her she didnt have to hide or sneak she was welcome to eat whenever she wanted. She hapilly said ok but would still scarf down her food at meals, say she was full . Then Id find evidence of sneaking food. <br/>
<br/>
At five being ashamed of eating to much has been brainwashed into her it seemed like . <br/>
The 2 things that helped are what Sandra just said...making the plates bigger than they can possibly eat and making a box for her.  I filled a box with a large variety of snacks and checked it daily ...its was hers to keep wherever she wanted. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1452260693">Rosie (18) has months where she is playing soccer, dancing, and doing <br/>
Kung Fu - that&#39;s more than 2 or 3 hours of intense exercise every day, <br/>
some days she&#39;ll have 6 or 7 hours of high-intensity exercise. Her body <br/>
tends to get worn down with that schedule, but it doesn&#39;t usually last <br/>
more than a few months, doing all of them at once.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s a small person, but the quantity of food she eats during those <br/>
months is amazing. She&#39;ll eat 2 or 3 avocados, with a whole box of <br/>
crackers, as a snack, between hearty meals, for example. During those <br/>
months, we sometimes go to a buffet. She&#39;ll pile a mountain of food on <br/>
her plate and I&#39;ll see people looking sideways at it, thinking she <br/>
surely can&#39;t eat it all. &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why though?  What purpose would it serve to say yes to 2, but not 3? <br/>
Sometimes kids like to explore certain flavors together.  For a little<br/>
one who was deprived of food, that could be especially true.  Babies<br/>
explore by tasting and differentiating between what is and isn&#39;t food. <br/>
If that wasn&#39;t available, they are still needing to explore that.<br/>
<br/>
No person can teach another what is excessive or not.  It&#39;s totally<br/>
personal to the individual body and needs of that body.  Some kids eat a<br/>
lot even if they were never deprived of food.  My friend&#39;s little kid,<br/>
at the age of 3 and 4 ate twice as much food as I did for every meal. <br/>
She&#39;s almost 15 now and is super tall and skinny.<br/>
<br/>
I am an adoptive parent as well and we<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; brought our oldest daughter home at 18 months. At that time she was<br/>
 </span></blockquote>our<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; only child and we allowed her to have everything she could possibly<br/>
 </span></blockquote>want.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; That&#39;s how she stayed overweight for about one year.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How does anyone know that a 3 or 4 yr old is overweight?  Is it by how<br/>
they look?  Is it by how much they weigh?  Will they really stay that<br/>
way after a couple of years?  The child mentioned above was a huge baby<br/>
and a very round little kid, she was extremely heavy, very solid.  She<br/>
still weighs a lot, but she&#39;s not overweight by any means, she very very<br/>
thin and has a hard time finding pants tiny enough around the waist and<br/>
still long enough for her super long legs.  How could anyone have<br/>
predicted that when she was 3 or 4?  There is only one other really tall<br/>
person in her family.<br/>
<br/>
I have a really hard time accepting someone calling a little kid<br/>
overweight, even for a year.  Kids are growing and changing all the<br/>
time.  One year a kid may be very round and the next they may grow tall.<br/>
<br/>
Then I saw that I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; wasn&#39;t helping her to give into her every demand for food and started<br/>
 </span></blockquote>saying<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; no and helping to implement healthy choices. She&#39;s almost 10 now and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>is a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; healthy happy little girl who is very bonded to her Daddy and I.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Being 10 and bonded is great, but it has nothing to do with food issues.<br/>
Just because you&#39;ve implemented &quot;healthy&quot; choices, doesn&#39;t mean that you<br/>
will ever control what your child eats or how it will affect her.  10 is<br/>
still young, the teen years are looming ahead.  A healthy 10 yr old<br/>
eating what her parents see as healthy will NOT garauntee that it will<br/>
produce a healthy 14 yr old happily eating what her parents deem<br/>
healthy.<br/>
<br/>
I object to the idea of &quot;giving into&quot; demands of a child.  As parents,<br/>
we can either be their partners and help them get what they want or we<br/>
can set life up so that everything is doled out by the parents and<br/>
requested by the child and given at the parent&#39;s discretion.  It doesn&#39;t<br/>
help natural learning when a child can&#39;t make the decision for<br/>
themselves as to what is good and healthy and enough.</div>

I was close with a foster child of 3 who had the same behavior. Turned out<br/>

year. As soon as he was treated (simple treatment), his frantic food<br/>
behavior stopped and he gained weight, finally feeling full.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-789320916">I am new to posting here (not reading here) but I can talk about this<br/>
one. <br/>
<br/>
We have a little daughter who we adopted at 3 1/2 that is now almost<br/>
6. She came from a history of severe neglect and malnutrition. She<br/>
came home with a tummy full of parasites, and an appetite that seemed<br/>
to never quit. We treated the parasites, but doing so could not treat<br/>
her underlying fears around food. Fears that she would never have<br/>
&quot;enough&quot;. She also seemed to have no &quot;off&quot; button and would eat until<br/>
she couldn&#39;t move, or until she vomited. She also panicked if one of<br/>
her siblings was eating and she wasn&#39;t. If we went anywhere, her first<br/>
questions were always about when and where she would eat. <br/>
<br/>
Two and a half years later and she is NOT the same kid in regards to<br/>
food. Yes, she gained a lot of weight, but she is healthy and active<br/>
and is just now leveling off. <br/>
<br/>
I think what&#39;s most important, is for you to address your own fears<br/>
behind your child&#39;s eating. For me, my daughter&#39;s eating brought up a<br/>
lot of my own fears from my childhood and mealtimes. I realized at one<br/>
point, that it was better for me to set her food in front of her,<br/>
smile at her, and calmly leave the room than to stay with her. She was<br/>
picking up on my anxiousness and it was making her more anxious. I<br/>
allowed her to eat in peace, without me hovering over her with MY fears. <br/>
<br/>
We stopped regulating her eating at all. I let her eat what she wanted<br/>
when she wanted. I also made sure that I was filling her &quot;love tank&quot;<br/>
constantly. I wanted her to associate filling up with love to get rid<br/>
of her feelings of &quot;emptiness&quot;. We kept finger foods handy in a<br/>
cupboard where she could reach them at anytime. We told her it was<br/>
&quot;ok&quot; to be full and that she could eat HER foods anytime she wanted.<br/>
We told her over and over that there would &quot;always be food&quot;. She would<br/>
often go to the cupboard just to open it and see if there was food<br/>
still in there. <br/>
<br/>
It broke my heart, but we stayed consistent and loving. <br/>
<br/>
Today she is healthy and her eating issues are mostly a thing of the<br/>
past. I still remember the first time she left food on her plate and<br/>
walked away. I cried. :) I knew she had reached a place of some<br/>
healing. She now regularly &quot;forgets&quot; to eat or chooses to eat later<br/>
when she is busy playing. She leaves food if she is full. She still<br/>
loves to eat and still worries some, but she trusts me to care for her<br/>
now and is not obsessed with food as she once was. <br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to give you some hope. :) And hope I didn&#39;t ramble on too<br/>
much! <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This reminded me of someone else I know. This teenage girl is kind of a <br/>
bigger person - tall, broad shouldered, normal weight. Her mother is <br/>
tall, too, but very thin. Her parents are very very controlling. To the <br/>
point that the mother controls exactly what food goes into her mouth. I <br/>
mean - when the girl is eating, the mother is watching and counting the <br/>
bites. When the girl asks for more, the mother gives her a lecture about <br/>
eating too much. She refers to her as a &quot;chowhound.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The girl really does think about food all the time. We went on a trip <br/>
together and when the itinerary was being planned, she was always really <br/>
panicky if it didn&#39;t include exactly when and where we were going to <br/>
eat. She could hardly think about what else there was to do if the <br/>
eating plans weren&#39;t settled first. When she&#39;s serving herself food, she <br/>
does it with one eye on her mother, who indicates when she should stop. <br/>
She constantly asks for more and her mother sometimes gives in and <br/>
sometimes doesn&#39;t. She always says things like, &quot;You don&#39;t need more,&quot; <br/>
or &quot;If you must, you can have one more and that&#39;s all.&quot; When we were <br/>
traveling together, the mother commented several times on how much my <br/>
girls eat. My girls are in good shape - they&#39;re very healthy and not <br/>
overweight or underweight. We were at a buffet and the mom stayed right <br/>
with her daughter and told her, &quot;One biscuit only. And you must have <br/>
some fruit with it.&quot; Stuff like that. My kids just picked out whatever <br/>
they wanted to eat, and the mom commented on their choices not being <br/>
&quot;balanced.&quot; Rosie likes potatoes a lot - she had french fries and hash <br/>
browns, both. Plus a bagel. The mom said something like, &quot;I see you&#39;re <br/>
having a whole meal of carbs.&quot;  Her daughter constantly asks for more <br/>
and absolutely always wants dessert. My kids seldom have dessert after a <br/>
meal, they have sweets whenever they want them, but right after eating <br/>
isn&#39;t usually one of those times. We had a birthday party here last <br/>
weekend and had a really delicious huge cake - and half of it was left. <br/>
It sat here for 3 days with little plates and forks and a cake knife <br/>
right at hand, and the kids never touched it. They&#39;d had enough at the <br/>
party and didn&#39;t feel like having more cake. For her, right after a meal <br/>
is one of the few time her mom will allow it (because she&#39;s just had <br/>
healthy foods, first), so she almost never fails to have dessert. I <br/>
wonder, when she goes off to college next year, how she&#39;ll handle her <br/>
food issues.<br/>
<br/>
So - I&#39;m not surprised that a kid who has been deprived of food seems to <br/>
have a desperation about it - but it is interesting to observe some of <br/>
the same behaviors when the child feels deprived but is actually getting <br/>
enough food to be healthy as well as when they are truly being <br/>
undernourished.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1679814197">If your son is constantly eating past the point where he is full, you could try offering transition activities.  Instead of &quot;you have had enough&quot;, try &quot;after you finish, lets play a game.&quot;  It might help him move on, without limits or worry that the food is being taken away.  <br/>
<br/>
Another option might be eating while another activity is happening.  Taking food to the park or while playing might help reinforce the idea of eating a bit and coming back when you are hungry.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-628580752">Just an odd suggestion.  Have you tried giving him something like an entire head of iceberg lettus and helped/shown how he can eat it layer by crunchy layer?  It is one of those foods you can eat all you want of and not get too much of anything that will upset your digestion. It also has a very satisfying way of disappearing slowly into a tiny ball. There are other similar foods like a nice loaf of french bread perhaps with a olive oil and balsamic vinegar dip.  Just something big he can sit and munch on that isn&#39;t too unhealthy but will satisfy his visual faculties and requires some creativity to eat. <br/>
<br/>
Another thought.  Does he have a food allergy or intolerance?  Some celiacs crave and eat a lot of breads and other gluten filled products and so do some people with milk and other food allergies.  just a thought.<br/>
<br/>
Also helping them learn about proper nutrition so they can have the information they need to make healthy food choices.  Not sure what it&#39;s called in the US but in Canada we have the Canada food Guide and in the past it was taped to our fridge.  Not as a set of rules but a general sort of guide to what is healthy and what we might want to try to consume.  When asked I explained things like &quot;No you don&#39;t have to eat all this everyday or only this amount. Some days you will be more hungry others less so. Just keep in mind what you have eaten over the last week or so and think about what your body might need.&quot;  When preparing meals for the family I was in the habit of talking to myself out loud and to the kids about what have we eaten today or the last week and what might we need more or less of to maintain a healthy body.  Never said you can&#39;t have that or this unless it was some else&#39;s birthday cake or something. <br/>
<br/>
Last idea look for other needs he might have that he might be trying to satisfy with food.  He might need more of something -one on one time, sports, books, snuggles, jumping whatever you might think of, games at the table- and be using food to fill that need.  If he was lacking food it could have become his comfort item like a blanky or stuffy.  It may have been the thing he needed or that satisfied his feeling of &quot;need&quot;. Perhaps he has not developed the ability transfer his feelings of &quot;need&quot; to the thing he actually &quot;needs&quot; and so when that &quot;need&quot; feeling comes up he thinks food instead of the thing that would actually fill the need.<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I would throw some suggestions out there.  It can be tough helping a little guy figure out what his body requires when his physical cues might be messed up from the inability to use them properly.  You might also want to help his develop a digestion vocabulary.  Talk about your own bodies feelings so he can think about or explain how his body might be feeling.  &quot;My tummy is so full it feels tight I think I ate too much.&quot;  &quot;When I eat too much fiber my bowels on my sides cramp and my poo comes fast..&quot; &quot;when I eat spicy foods my tummy feels all full of acid and burns.&quot;  What ever is happening give it a name and a feeling and a result and talk about how his body might react.  Creating dialog helps create awareness with out any need for the child to feel they are being accused or blamed ro shamed or what have you.<br/>
<br/>
Just ideas feel free to toss them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-597600890">I&#39;m not an adoptive parent so I can&#39;t speak to that issue specifically.<br/>
<br/>
But I offer my daughter food whenever she wants it.  She is 13 months.<br/>
 I have found that if I give her what she needs (NOT wants...i.e. I<br/>
don&#39;t let her play with the knives I use to cut the food up, though<br/>
she would if I allowed it) she does not cry or beg or act clingy.  She<br/>
is content and free to do whatever she needs -- exploring her world,<br/>
typically.<br/>
<br/>
She is very picky right now too...lucky for me with healthy food. <br/>
Some have told me &quot;you have to teach her to sit in her chair for meal<br/>
times and you must offer her whatever you are serving and if she<br/>
doesn&#39;t eat it she can go hungry.&quot;  This doesn&#39;t work for us at all. <br/>
I serve her what I know she&#39;ll eat and if she doesn&#39;t I assume she is<br/>
not hungry.  I let her do a LOT of things most people wouldn&#39;t.  I let<br/>
her stand up in her high chair and climb on it (while I was watching).<br/>
 She only had to fall once to stop trying.  Maybe that sounds mean but<br/>
the alternative was to constantly yell at her, take away her food<br/>
(she&#39;d turn around and grab another bite, then turn back to play, she<br/>
was still hungry), hit her, etc. whatever people do to &quot;teach&quot; kids to<br/>
stop doing things like that.  I just ignore her and after she fell I<br/>
comforted her and now she does not do it.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway -- your son will learn to self-regulate in time and natural<br/>
consequences (i.e. feeling sick) will teach him soon enough what is<br/>
enough and when to stop.<br/>
<br/>
Why with hold food?  If he is making himself sick he will soon learn<br/>
that being sick doesn&#39;t feel good and he will stop eating quite so much.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I object to the idea of &quot;giving into&quot; demands of a child.  As parents,<br/>
&gt; we can either be their partners and help them get what they want or we<br/>
&gt; can set life up so that everything is doled out by the parents and<br/>
&gt; requested by the child and given at the parent&#39;s discretion.  It doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; help natural learning when a child can&#39;t make the decision for<br/>
&gt; themselves as to what is good and healthy and enough.<br/>

Yes! This is another thing we do. :) It works very well. Just make<br/>
sure that your child understands that food will is readily available<br/>

Sometimes it helps us to offer to put some away for later.  Either we  <br/>
mark it with the person&#39;s name or they decide they don&#39;t care who eats  <br/>
it later.  But it&#39;s a little like offering to record a TV program.   <br/>
They might never want to watch it, but it does solve the immediate  <br/>
indecision.<br/>

something. we will put it in a baggie and either leave it at his <br/>
place at the table or put it in the fridge.  we get a little chuckle <br/>
because he will come back within just a few minutes and eat it, but <br/>
it is a start.  <br/>
after reading many of the suggestions on here, I realize he has made <br/>
progress in the past 1 1/2 years.  for the past couple days I have <br/>
been giving him what he asks for whenever he does and both last night <br/>
and this afternoon he left a little food on his plate by the end of <br/>
the day. <br/>
I also found that if he has been eating alot but asks for things <br/>
because someone else is eating it... it doesnt take much of the item <br/>
to make him happy.  <br/>
thanks for all your suggestions and stories.</div>

Soon (or you&#39;ve missed it, depending when you read this).<br/>
There will probably be a transcript put up.<br/>
<br/>
And there&#39;s a contest.  The winner or winners will get to choose from some prizes I&#39;ll list <br/>
between now and the 15th of March.<br/>
<br/>
The contest is the best image of a monkey platter.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve never photographed one of mine, but I&#39;ll do that around the 15th too and add mine to the <br/>
collection.   For many people, words are not what does it when it comes to food.  If we can <br/>
show a range of monkey platters, kids everywhere might snack better!<br/>

Are the pets really hungry?  Do they not have food down all the time?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  sandra, i don&#39;t know about the OP, but we have two dogs, one of whom WILL literally climb ONTO the dining table to eat any food left out, and yes her bowl is always available, but she definitely prefers human food by far.  she will also stand on her hind legs and use her front paw to &quot;scoot&quot; the butter dish, or any food left too close to the edge into her reach zone.<br/>
<br/>
  she is awful that way, and it&#39;s really frustrating.  it did preclude anything like a monkey platter when the kids were toddlers/young, unless we locked her up, which we did do sometimes. she would even gently take food out of their hands if they were walking around with it!  <br/>

This thread really interests me because I love the idea of monkey platters<br/>
but we have 3 very large dogs that don&#39;t need to stand on their hind legs to<br/>
have their heads on the counter, in the sink, or on the table.  They always<br/>
have food and water available and they still take food.  Our greyhound is<br/>
getting very brave and will even take it from the kids when they are eating<br/>
if DH or I aren&#39;t right there.  I&#39;ve just had to keep food put away unless<br/>
we are eating it or put the dogs out but I can&#39;t have them out all day; it&#39;s<br/>
too hot here in AZ for that and they are part of the family.  I liked the<br/>
links Schuyler sent but I&#39;m pretty sure they could get the lids off fairly<br/>
easily. LOL  <br/>
