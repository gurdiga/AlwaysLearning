<div id="ygrps-yiv-316054098">The thing my children and I were most bothered by, I think, was the question posed by the interviewer &quot;Isn&#39;t it the job of the parents to MAKE their kids do things they don&#39;t want to do?&quot;  What kind of parent wants to be doing that?  <br/>
I would love to hear the entire interview, I mean it was certainly edited to be sensationalized.  I kept answering for the parents in the ways I wish they did.  But they may have had better answers that were edited out.  What I think needs to come across to people is the fact that the way the general public feels about education is NOT the only way to go.  That we have been brainwashed basically to believe that if we don&#39;t follow a certain path then we are doomed to failure.  What people don&#39;t realize is that this has been set up so that people continue to be sheeople, they are just part of perpetuating all the problems that we are facing in the US.  Ok maybe that is a bit much but I just wish they gave the parents a real chance to explain the reasons for unschooling and how it has worked.  If the scope could be widened as to how people view learning it would help the entire world:) <br/>
 OK rant over!<br/>

It&#39;s in every industrialized nation around the world.  Last night I sent someone a link to Sir Ken Robinson&#39;s website with a note attatched that said &quot;I&#39;m not afraid to be wrong, are you?  Live life and have fun.  Best wishes to you.&quot;  Here&#39;s the link I sent <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sirkenrobinson.com/">http://www.sirkenrobinson.com/</a> <br/>
<br/>
I chose Sir Ken Robinson because he has a lot to say about the creative process and how schools harm it, but also, he&#39;s more about school reform than the abolishment of the school system, which the recipient will appreciate more.<br/>
