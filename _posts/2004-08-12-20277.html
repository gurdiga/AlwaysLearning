and one in Boston not long after.   Both this month.  Maybe you&#39;re in range <br/>

The description of this group:<br/>
 <br/>
********************8Discussion for homeschooling fans of John Holt, whose  <br/>
books Learning All the Time, Never Too Late, and Teach your Own have made  <br/>
unschooling a sweet and viable option for thousands of families. <br/>
<br/>
This is  a moderated group, with trapdoors for the uncooperative. (Not <br/>
moderated in the  advance-approval way, but in the be-nice-to-play way.) It&#39;s an <br/>
idea group and is  intended to lean more toward pure unschooling than neutral, <br/>
general  homeschooling discussion--there are hundreds of general homeschooling  <br/>
discussions for newcomers. It&#39;s to focus more toward how people learn no <br/>
matter  where in the world they are, rather than on what&#39;s legal in any particular  <br/>
country or jurisdiction. <br/>
<br/>
If you have questions or complaints, write to  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:_SandraDodd@...">_SandraDodd@...</a>_ <br/>
(mailto:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:SandraDodd@...">SandraDodd@...</a>) ******************<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s an e-group for folks who already &quot;get&quot; unschooling. If you&#39;d like a  <br/>
more basic group to understand unschooling, try <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:U_nschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com">U_nschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>_ (mailto:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>)    OR  <br/>

<br/>
Lot more info there.<br/>
<br/>
And the best list for new unschoolers is probably one called <br/>
UnschoolingBasics, another yahoogroup.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind if people discuss it here, but generally this list isn&#39;t set up <br/>
for total beginners.   If some of the list members want to do a beginning <br/>
session here, that&#39;s fine with me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-579308433">Hi linda...<br/>
<br/>
I know you, so had to laugh at the response you got from asking for a <br/>
definition of unschooling on this list!  lol!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re trying to get a clarification of terms since you&#39;ve met <br/>
so many HSrs who identify themselves as unschoolers but who really wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
under your definition.  (Most of us in our local group have had similar <br/>
experiences.)  I know we&#39;ve discussed that there&#39;s so much latitude under the term <br/>
that it&#39;s becoming less and less helpful to use it to convey one&#39;s <br/>
HS/educational philosophy.  Lately I&#39;ve found it more helpful to identify myself as a <br/>
&quot;radical unschooler&quot; (albeit at the potential cost of alienating some people! <br/>
lol!) because more HSrs quickly understand that term.  Unschooling (IMO) is <br/>
becoming too broad an umbrella to have any true meaning without qualifiers and/or <br/>
explanations...especially between, and amongst, &quot;unschoolers!&quot;  lol!<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to hearing back from you, and some others on this!<br/>

<br/>
A few months ago a new member at our park day was asking me about my<br/>
homeschooling style. I told her I was an Unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
She replied, &quot;But when your daughter is older you&#39;ll start using a<br/>
curriculum.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I said something like, &quot;I don&#39;t think so. I&#39;m a *radical* unschooler.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Without a single word, the woman turned and RAN back to her group of friends<br/>
in another area of the park. Literally as if I had some contaminating<br/>
disease. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never seen her since, but it sure was odd.<br/>
