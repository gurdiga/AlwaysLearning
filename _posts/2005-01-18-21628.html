<div id="ygrps-yiv-223111653">Hi there,<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading posts for a few months now and I could really use<br/>
some ideas.  We&#39;ve been unschooling, although it&#39;s been pretty easy up<br/>
to now.  We&#39;re just living life.  My daugher is 5 years old, and we<br/>
have a 19 month son.  Now Lauren has started telling me she wants to<br/>
read.  I thought we&#39;d wait until she is 6 or 7 and that it would be<br/>
more natural at that time, but she is tenacious and very persistent! <br/>
I think she sees us reading and wants to do the same.  I told her she<br/>
needs to learn what sounds different letters make, and when she asks<br/>
me what sound a particular letter makes, I tell her.  Does anyone have<br/>
other ideas?  Are there ways to make this more fun?  She does love to<br/>
play games.<br/>
Thanks for any insights/suggestions you can offer.<br/>
Deanna</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-944602009">My girls enjoyed labeling things in the house.  I&#39;d print a word on a sticky<br/>
paper and give it to them and they&#39;d try to guess what thing it went on and<br/>
stick it there.  We mixed some easy ones, like TV and some harder ones like<br/>
curtains.  It was fun.  Some children learn to read young and that&#39;s o.k. if<br/>
that&#39;s what they want.  Both my girls could read pretty well by the time<br/>
they were five and a half.  Both girls were motivated to learn to read and<br/>
that made it easy.  Just listen to her and don&#39;t push it, but find fun ways<br/>
to play games that involve reading.  <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2082897483">my 9yo Shea reads for enjoyment and had an unusual way of learning to <br/>
read... he memorized pages/ books, I would hear him &quot;reading&quot; to <br/>
himself in the same voice and inflection I used, then he would try and <br/>
match up the text word to the spoken word... I thought he was actually <br/>
reading at age 4, but it turned out he was reciting... I was <br/>
disappointed then, but am in a different mind now... he sings from <br/>
lyric sheets, and he likes to participate in plays/ theater, he played <br/>
2 characters once in a skit when one of the kids didn&#39;t show up, he <br/>
knew the lines for both... my 6 yo is reading on a need-to-know <br/>
basis... he reads road signs, the pull/ push sign on doors, likes maps <br/>
and instructions for Ikea furniture... he has very little patience yet, <br/>
so when he wants to be still for awhile he looks at his books... I&#39;m <br/>
not big on reading though so I don&#39;t check their progress meticulously, <br/>
they usually tell me when they have a breakthrough...  a funny thing <br/>
Shea said about my lack of interest in reading is that &quot;I am always in <br/>
a fantasy in my mind, so it&#39;s easy to read and imagine their fantasy [a <br/>
book], but [mom] is in reality so much she reads for reality...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1981710145">My DD (turns 5 this April) also &quot;reads&quot; pages from memory, and a few <br/>
words (like, IKEA & TJ Maxx)!<br/>
<br/>
She devised a game we play called &quot;What starts with...&quot;. We usually <br/>
play it in the car, but it can be done anywhere, and is played <br/>
like &quot;I Spy&quot;, but with sounds/words. The person who is &quot;It&quot; <br/>
says, &quot;What starts with &quot;kuh&quot;?  (answer=car). We all guess at what <br/>
that person has seen, or happens to be thinking about.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-869445195">For kids who want to learn to read and love computers, I recommend the  <br/>
Reader Rabbit program.  My daughter taught herself to read at 4 or 5 with  it.<br/>
