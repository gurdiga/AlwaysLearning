Lovely.<br/>
<br/>
I saw a quote on a sign for a Church of Christ in a little town near me.  <br/>
This guy puts up some good ones, even though they&#39;re probably a pretty <br/>
fundamentalist congregation.  They&#39;re not always scripture or damnation.  I meant to <br/>
take a picture of it this time. It said:  &quot;They know enough who know how to learn&quot;<br/>

other than that it&#39;s pretty much my philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I&#39;m missing the context?<br/>

I&#39;m the OP.  I&#39;m a bit embarrassed, as I meant to forward this to a small local group I&#39;m part of, and somehow sent it here by mistake.<br/>
<br/>
I just thought it was a great little quote.  It makes sense to me!  <br/>

LOL! And I realized after reading it again that I had read it wrong! Now I <br/>
feel like a dunce. I thought it said &quot;... will never learn ANYTHING...&quot; So off I <br/>
go, reminding myself that I really don&#39;t have to reply to everything I <br/>
*think* I don&#39;t understand! <br/>
Sorry bout that!<br/>

Yeah, but I remember when you adopted Nana from Julie, and I am sure others <br/>
do too, and I was happy to hear about her. As for the other post, I&#39;m just <br/>
embarrassed that I read the whole thing wrong. Whether it was intended for this <br/>
list or not, I can&#39;t believe it took me so long to go back and read it <br/>
correctly! <br/>

Well, come join me over here on the couch. I&#39;ve reserved it just for folks <br/>
who have horrid reading comprehension skills! (not that *I* have problems with <br/>
reading comprehension! &lt;bwg&gt;)<br/>
