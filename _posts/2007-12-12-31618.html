<div id="ygrps-yiv-752709122">I am a ball of emotions today -- yesterday I met a friend for coffee and<br/>
during our visit she brought up ds (mine) and how back in October when he<br/>
and dd where there to pick up her dd&#39;s for some afternoon fun she almost<br/>
kicked him out of her house. He was dressed in goth and apparently he was<br/>
either not in a good mood or just had the &quot;goth&quot; attitude that day and she<br/>
didn&#39;t really want her girls going out into town with him. She is someone<br/>
who usually says what&#39;s on her mind and often gives ds her opinion on his<br/>
hair length or style etc..... and expects him to smile and be happy about it<br/>
while she &quot;teases&quot;. DS usually doesn&#39;t say anything when she does that and<br/>
has said that&#39;s just her opinion and it doesn&#39;t get to him, but my guess is<br/>
on this particular occasion he stood up for himself.  She reasoned that is<br/>
was October after all and the month to play dress up and she let it ride.<br/>
She said on subsequent visits he was nicer and seemed more like himself. Now<br/>
ds has his girlfriend coming to visit for a week (who also likes to dress up<br/>
goth for some fun ---) and she really wants to meet friends dd. Friend said<br/>
that she and dh will not allow dd to go out of the house with my ds if he is<br/>
dressed that way because it draws &quot;drug users and those types of people&quot;<br/>
(her words) to you and attracts unwanted attention. She is under pressure<br/>
from her dh but said it was 50% her opinion as well. These are people we<br/>
have known and been very good friends with for over seven years. Our kids<br/>
grew up together. The last four years they have lived different places and<br/>
their eldest dd really had a hard time and ds was the one person she could<br/>
confide in and be herself with. I am just at a loss today at finding them so<br/>
shallow in only seeing the clothes and/or makeup instead of the boy they<br/>
know. Their dd has chain pants and likes to dress goth as well --- but she<br/>
doesn&#39;t do it when her dad is home and she doesn&#39;t do it when they go out in<br/>
public (because she isn&#39;t allowed to). We are very different in our<br/>
parenting styles and friend is not an unschooler --- over the years we have<br/>
been able to co-exist and maintain our friendship without bashing each<br/>
others choices.....until now. This just came so out of the blue and I am<br/>
riding a roller coaster of thoughts and emotions on how to move forward.<br/>

it&#39;s her decision for her daughter. She gets to choose what she feels  <br/>
is right for her child just as you do. It&#39;s respectful to honor that.<br/>
<br/>
To be respectful of a person, to model respect for our kids, we need  <br/>
to respect their right to choose for their own children. We don&#39;t  <br/>
have to agree! Just say, that&#39;s her rules. Sometimes it rains.  <br/>
Sometimes stores want us to wear shoes to shop. Sometimes parents get  <br/>
nervous for their children. That&#39;s just as things are.<br/>
<br/>
No matter where you go there will be local rules. It&#39;s our choice  <br/>
whether to go along with them, flaunt them or not go in. I think we  <br/>
do a disservice to our kids to stomp on others&#39; wishes just because  <br/>
it feels controlling. Courtesy is about honoring someone else&#39;s  <br/>
wishes to set the rules for their own place.<br/>
<br/>
Your son could flaunt her rules, maybe change clothes after they left  <br/>
the daughter&#39;s house, but what will he have gained? He will have  <br/>
gained control, but at what price? When the daughter&#39;s mother finds  <br/>
out, what will he lose?<br/>
<br/>
If your son has a lot of control over his own life then this isn&#39;t  <br/>
going to be a big deal to him. (Nor should you make it one.) If he  <br/>
doesn&#39;t need to fight for control in his own life, letting others  <br/>
have control of their own worlds, won&#39;t feel like a loss of control  <br/>
to him. Only those who have so little control need to fight for  <br/>
control over others.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-435231001">-=-. I am just at a loss today at finding them so<br/>
shallow in only seeing the clothes and/or makeup instead of the boy they<br/>
know.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When my kids have dressed or worn their hair in any way that  <br/>
potentially sent a message of which they were unaware, I&#39;d advise  <br/>
them.  Holly did the Britney Spears look a few times when she was too  <br/>
young to know what it could mean to nasty older guys.  Marty went  <br/>
with his head shaved to the first Live and Learn conference (maybe  <br/>
the first two or three) and I told him that in different parts of the  <br/>
country people could misinterpret that, and he needed to be aware of it.<br/>
<br/>
When a kid makes an informed choice, they need to live with the  <br/>
consequences.<br/>
<br/>
-=-over the years we have been able to co-exist and maintain our  <br/>
friendship without bashing each others choices.....until now.-=-<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s not bashing your choices, she&#39;s uncomfortable with your son&#39;s  <br/>
choices.  Having let him make choices, you need to let the natural  <br/>
consequences play out for him.  That&#39;s how he&#39;ll learn when and how  <br/>
to dress in ways of his choosing.<br/>
<br/>
Friends for years doesn&#39;t guarantee friends for life, in any case,  <br/>
with anyone.  If he made his choices just to keep that friend it  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be any healthier than making his choices to keep his  <br/>
girlfriend happy.   Maybe help him consider the reasons for choices.<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be wrong to condemn your friend for her attitude.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve lost friends over the years.  In a discussion just a couple of  <br/>
weeks ago about someone who&#39;s a friend of several people I know, I  <br/>
mentioned that she has never warmed up to me because she was unhappy  <br/>
I had homeschooled.  She&#39;s still waiting for me to send Kirby to  <br/>
school so she can be my friend again, I said.   And it&#39;s funny, since  <br/>
he&#39;s 21, but that&#39;s basically the deal.  She was kinda playing freeze- <br/>
out with  me, and I chose Kirby over her.  It was an easy choice for  <br/>
me, but she didn&#39;t understand it.<br/>
