<div id="ygrps-yiv-2089112108">&quot;The idea that the majority of students attend a university for an <br/>
education independent of the degree and grades is a hypocrisy everyone is <br/>
happier not to expose. Occasionally some students do arrive for an education <br/>
but rote and mechanical nature of the institution soon converts them to a <br/>
less idealic attitude&quot;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Just ran across this quote -- and I thought how, when that book was written, <br/>
people DID pretend they were at universities REALLY for the education and <br/>
that the degree and grades were secondary. I very very very seldom see even <br/>
that pretense, anymore.<br/>
<br/>
But I absolutely for real have seen that the unschooled kids ARE there to <br/>
learn and that degrees and grades are secondary to them.<br/>

transferred to a state college from a community college and was shocked at <br/>
all the kids who were there just to party for 4 years and then collect <br/>
their piece of paper at the end.  I even found many of the courses I took <br/>
to be easier than the ones I took at the community college.  The community <br/>
college was a delightful place.  I went there from a couple of years of <br/>
unschooling (there wasn&#39;t a name for it then) and found it to be an <br/>
exciting place, filled with people who were there because they wanted to be <br/>
there, for many different reasons.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes -  I suppose there was little pretense among undergraduates themselves.  <br/>
They did pretend to the professors, though, that they were there to learn. In <br/>
1976, if I asked a classroom full of students to write down on a card what <br/>
they hoped to get out of my class, they would be full of high-sounding <br/>
reasons. These days they&#39;d be much more blunt - &quot;I hope to pass because it is <br/>
a requirement to get my degree in business.&quot; THEN if you ask them why they <br/>
want to get a college degree at all? &quot;To make more money.&quot; Straight out, <br/>
straight up - no hemming or hawing or beating around any bushes. Nobody is <br/>
even remotely embarrassed or has any sense that that is might be considered <br/>
(at least by the professors) a rather crass reason to be in college. That is <br/>
a big change from 25 years ago.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1104736478">I teach Arab women here in the UAE and the majority of them are going to<br/>
college for something to do (life is very boring when you have tons of<br/>
money but aren&#39;t allowed to leave the house) or to delay marriage. However<br/>
there are about 20% of them who are so hungry to learn that it&#39;s amazing.<br/>
Much higher percentage than in western universities I think.<br/>
<br/>
My mom started a Ph.D program last winter. As a teacher she will get a $30<br/>
raise per month when she finishes however she will almost be ready for<br/>
retirement. She calls me to share things she has read and is excited about<br/>
spending hours studying. Watching her enthusiasm about learning is joyful<br/>
and contagious. Perhaps the trick of higher ed is to stay away until you<br/>
discover who you are and what you truly enjoy.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have a slightly different perspective. I went to an alternative, hippy <br/>
college (Hampshire College in Amherst, MA) and genuinely found most of the <br/>
people who were there really wanted to learn. Or, at least, were not just <br/>
jumping through hoops to get a credential. (There were others who were there <br/>
learning in Alternative alternative ways, but they eventually left because <br/>
their parents figured they could do that somewhere else, cheaper.)<br/>
<br/>
After graduation, I signed up to do alum admissions interviews. They only <br/>
required interviews in iffy situations, and one required interviiew I got was <br/>
from a very straight-laced kid who had a 4.0, Eagle Scout, high SATs, wanting <br/>
to major in Computer Science,  etc...all the things most colleges lust after <br/>
in a potential student.<br/>
<br/>
Hampshire needed to know...Why us? Do you know what you&#39;re getting into?<br/>
<br/>
When i talked to him, I discovered why. (Parents had met at Woodstock, wanted <br/>
to learn and discover stuff, not just get a degree...) He went to Hampshire, <br/>
and loved it.<br/>
<br/>
I actually transferred to Hampshire from a traditional college. I was bored. <br/>
I figured if I went to Hampshire and was bored, it was my own damned fault.<br/>

homeschooling stuff for you.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Probably true of any kind of &quot;education from the outside in&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
My niece is going into grade 12 next year.  When I asked if she had any <br/>
plans for the future, she said she wanted to go to university and <br/>
travel.  When I suggested travelling first, she told me about a friend who <br/>
did the first year at home and then got scholarships to travel and study <br/>
abroad after that.  She never did tell me what she thought she might want <br/>
to *do* with that education.<br/>
