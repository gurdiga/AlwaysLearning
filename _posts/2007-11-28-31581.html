<div id="ygrps-yiv-648868384">Do all online articles have the comments after, now? I couldn&#39;t find *just*  <br/>
the article without the comment section, but I&#39;m guessing it can be  <br/>
cut-and-pasted, if necessary. Just thought some folks might like an article to  share <br/>
with the doubters in their lives:<br/>

<br/>
Interesting question! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Newspaper articles seem to like the automatic letters-to-the-editor  <br/>
function, and there&#39;s a tradition of letting people respond to  <br/>
newspaper and magazine articles.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it does quite break the mood, though, to have  insipid or  <br/>
ignorant comments.   I like to immerse myself in the message and mood  <br/>
of people&#39;s writing or opinions sometimes without interruption.<br/>
<br/>
Although sometimes comments detract, other times they&#39;re the best part.<br/>
<br/>
