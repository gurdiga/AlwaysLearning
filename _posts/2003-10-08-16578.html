<div id="ygrps-yiv-28901204">Well, I had a nice big long, and I hope helpful,<br/>
response typed out yesterday.  But my computer ate it.<br/>
 I was too frustrated to redo it.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, I have boys, and one (Thomas, almost 7)<br/>
who has issues with explosive temperment, anger<br/>
management, appropriate behaviors, etc.  I concur with<br/>
those who said that the parents can feel worn down,<br/>
exhausted, at a loss as to what to do or how to react<br/>
to their child&#39;s behavior.  It&#39;s hard to have the kid<br/>
that everyone thinks is a &quot;brat&quot; or a &quot;bad seed.&quot; <br/>
It&#39;s hard to know how to respond when people seem to<br/>
act like we train them at home to be as bad as<br/>
possible in public.<br/>
<br/>
Thomas has learned from lots of modeling,<br/>
intervention, posistive reinforcement, and gentle<br/>
correction.  Older children and adults are often<br/>
better playmtes for kids like this, as they are better<br/>
able to handle outbursts, keep the kids under control<br/>
(by physical constraint if necessary) and not take<br/>
things personally. I also agree that this child should<br/>
be watched more closely by someone willing to<br/>
intervene before or during explosions and willing to<br/>
talk to him honestly, but not judgementally, about his<br/>
behavior.  They are often more scared by their strong<br/>
and overpowering emotions than those around them. <br/>
Anger becomes an alternative expression for their fear<br/>
and anxiety (much accepted and encouraged in western<br/>
males unfortunately.)<br/>
<br/>
Thomas does better in reduced stress situations.  When<br/>
he was littler, I didn&#39;t take him to the park if there<br/>
were a lot of people there, or we went to a less<br/>
crowded park.  Too many people means too much input,<br/>
and invariably a meltdown.  He&#39;s been described by<br/>
some of the various drug touting &quot;letter people&quot; we<br/>
gave up seeing (Dr.s, counselors etc) as &quot;a kid on<br/>
constant overload&quot; because of his difficulties<br/>
filtering his sensory information.  It just all pours<br/>
into him at once.  While that means he is precocious,<br/>
doesn&#39;t miss a trick, is quick witted and intelligent,<br/>
it also means he is easily stressed out and thrown by<br/>
too much to take in, can&#39;t tune things out, is<br/>
bothered by noises, sensations, smells, etc that most<br/>
of us would not notice.  <br/>
<br/>
We have to take parties, carnivals, and other public<br/>
activities in small doses and be mindful of his<br/>
current level of overall life stress when planning<br/>
whether or not to attend things.  We stay home more<br/>
when there are things happening that cause stress in<br/>
the family or for him.  He is hyper sensative to<br/>
others&#39; feelings and will cry when someone else is<br/>
hurt, but in a public situations when he is distracted<br/>
by intense activity levels he can be stunningly<br/>
thoughtless of others and have great remorse over it<br/>
when it is called to his attention.<br/>
<br/>
Now I don&#39;t know if this other kid is anything like<br/>
Thomas, but it&#39;s quite possible that if you only see<br/>
him in an active setting like the park days, that<br/>
you&#39;re only seeing him at his worst and most stressed<br/>
out.  Thomas talks fast, moves fast (we always say he<br/>
never learned to walk, he learned to run) and seems<br/>
really hyperactive, because that is the speed at which<br/>
the world moves for him.  We try to slow things down<br/>
for him as much as possible, keep noise to a minimum<br/>
of sources at home, play board games, read stories,<br/>
play computer strategy and mystery games, watch movies<br/>
that are more calm and musical and less violent. <br/>
Thomas is passionate about movies and loves high<br/>
fantasy (knights, dragons, etc) but we try to keep<br/>
that to only one movie like that a day, so he can<br/>
digest it better.  We don&#39;t have commercial tv at all,<br/>
which helps a lot.  He is like a mirror and reflects<br/>
back what is around him.  When we take time to create<br/>
a calmer home environment, he is more calm and more<br/>
focused and centered himself, and more content.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this is from the perspective of someone who<br/>
has a child with these issues.  Thomas gets better and<br/>
better every year at self control and appropriate<br/>
behaviors, cause and effect and not modeling<br/>
everything he sees or hears.  He&#39;s a good lesson to us<br/>
though, to keep out tempers and watch what we say to<br/>
and about others or ourselves, because we&#39;ll get it<br/>
back WHAM right in our faces from him if we don&#39;t.  At<br/>
nearly 7 he is almost always perfectly polite in<br/>
public and when things start to disentigrate it means<br/>
he has had enough and it&#39;s time to go.  Occassionally<br/>
we still get screaming fits and he has to be carried<br/>
to the car or another quiet place until he is calm,<br/>
but he doesn&#39;t hit or lash out physically to other<br/>
kids anymore.  OK well, except for his brother on<br/>
occassion, but I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be engaging in that<br/>
sport of brotherly love until they are well taller<br/>
than me.<br/>
<br/>
Talk to the child directly, like you would your own<br/>
child or a friends child (as someone suggested) with<br/>
brief, matter of fact statements about what IS and<br/>
what IS NOT acceptable behavior.  Try to say positive<br/>
things to them too, when you notice them behaving,<br/>
compliments about things &quot;Wow great jumping!&quot; or &quot;I<br/>
really like you when you smile.&quot;  That sort of thing. <br/>
Positive reinforcement goes a long way, plus it will<br/>
help to build a bridge of trust between you so that he<br/>
will out more weight behind what you say.  I hope this<br/>
helps.<br/>
