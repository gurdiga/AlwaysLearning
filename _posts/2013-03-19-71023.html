<div id="ygrps-yiv-447304966">There is also an interview w/ Gabor Mate (which will be available for free until 6pm on Wed.)  He has a unique perspective on ADHD and co-authored the book, &quot;Hold on to your Kids.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I find his perspective lends itself to understanding how the relationship between parent/child can be healing or harmful.</div>

<br/>
I am familiar with &quot;Hold on to Your Kids&quot; - how do you think his unique perspective fits in with radical unschooling (if indeed you think so)?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Can you quote Dr. Mate on the subject? We could then discuss it in more detail.<br/>

There was no link to the interview in your message.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It would&#39;ve been the same link as the original post.  At the bottom of any e-mail is a link that says &quot;messages in this topic.&quot;  <br/>
And those interviews were only free for a very short while, so there&#39;s no advantage to bringing the link now.<br/>
<br/>
For those reading on the web, if you change the sort from &quot;individual message&quot; to &quot;topics,&quot; you can see whatever&#39;s being referred to within a thread.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m okay not to discuss those. :-)  The note that there were free interviews was fine.  :-)   <br/>
