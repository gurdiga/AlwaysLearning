<br/>
<br/>
You can get old Ed Sullivan shows (or at least &quot;best of&quot;) on video.<br/>
<br/>
For movies, maybe just go by date and get one of the older ones (toward the <br/>
younger-thinner end).   Of those I remember, I like Blue Hawaii.  Lots of <br/>
historical/social interest, and scenery of Hawaii when it was just newly  <br/>
made a state.<br/>
<br/>
Jailhouse Rock?<br/>
<br/>
There might be concert videos of early concerts.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-157659357">I think &quot;Charo&quot;  was a western and not to soppy.  He had a beard in that<br/>
one and maybe isn&#39;t Elvis enough.   <br/>
&quot;Love Me Tender&quot; has a attempted suicide, if that&#39;s not a comfortable<br/>
topic.  <br/>
&quot;Flaming Star&quot; is another western, but a romance too, and there are<br/>
racial issues and comments.  <br/>
Mostly they&#39;re all romance, but not really lusty or anything.  <br/>
There are some with race cars, I can&#39;t remember the names.  There&#39;s one<br/>
with Nancy Sinatra.  I don&#39;t know what that means.<br/>
&quot;Kid Galahad&quot; is about a boxer. <br/>
<br/>
Elvis isn&#39;t so bad, my (almost) ten year old does the &quot;Three Stooges&quot; and<br/>
Groucho Marx.  <br/>
And Edward G. Robinson.  <br/>
And Katherine Hepburn.  RAILY he does. <br/>

Ha! It&#39;ll be my luck that he&#39;ll eventually be what drags me in there. My <br/>
punishment for having chosen to sleep instead when I had the chance. :)<br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t do ALL Elvis. The other day he was doing some annoying thing that <br/>
I can&#39;t remember over and over and over until I gave him a glare and the all <br/>
three names routine. He spun around and burst into a song and dance routine-<br/>
<br/>
I drive you crazy<br/>
ooh ooh<br/>
Like no one else<br/>
ooh  ooh<br/>
I drive you crazy<br/>
And I can&#39;t help myself<br/>
ooh ooh ooh<br/>
(Apologies to Fine Young Cannibals fans)<br/>
<br/>
I guess he&#39;s our unclass clown. Classless clown? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
