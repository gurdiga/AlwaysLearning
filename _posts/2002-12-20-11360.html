<br/>
That is wonderful!<br/>
<br/>
But did the rest of the paragraph make sense then?<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re IN live, using what you&#39;ve learned from life, where do you go from <br/>
there!?  &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-998865371">The story was about a little girl who felt she could do nothing/make <br/>
nothing as her siblings were so much more talented  than she--one could <br/>
bake another could knit.  What could this one child do. So with her <br/>
mother&#39;s help she made a &quot;What I can Do&quot; box and there were trying to <br/>
figure out what to write in it.  &quot;I can read bedtime stories by my <br/>
self.&quot;  I can cook such and such&quot;  so yes, it made good sense.<br/>
