<div id="ygrps-yiv-1849024954">Hello Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Tim finally found a solution to our computer troubles, now I won&#39;t send any<br/>
more messages 3 times. Sorry about that.<br/>
<br/>
 We stayed home this weekend without an agenda. The kids watched cartoons for<br/>
hours, then played games and folded origami. We swam in our vinyl pool, and at<br/>
the city pools. I read Ashley the last half of Little Princess. We let the<br/>
kittens out to explore the yard. Tim mowed and watered.<br/>
<br/>
 Tim and I are amazed that in our family, the three kids can not manage to<br/>
cope with each other for more than 2 minutes. You all have heard about us<br/>
before. My oldest pesters her brother and he responds physically. Both older<br/>
kids do great with their sister, who is 2.5. So, even though we were home<br/>
without a rush just by ourselves, we had tension that gets very tiring as my 2<br/>
kids work out their relationship.<br/>
<br/>
Ashley continues to whine cry at the slightest suggestions from mom and dad.<br/>
She just does not seem to enjoy life with her family, which depresses us.<br/>
She&#39;s bright, energetic, creative, nurturing to others. We wonder is she<br/>
tired? Over stimulated? Bored? If life does not go as Ashley has planned, she<br/>
fights and cries and whines so no one else can enjoy themselves. She had a<br/>
sleepover this week and threw a tantrum because she talked her friend into<br/>
doing something that made her friend sad. As I spoke with her about force and<br/>
coersion, she blew up into tears and her sad feelings overshadowed the fact<br/>
that her friend said no and Ashley talked her into taking apart a bracelet<br/>
that is very difficult to put back together. All this at 6 am. Ashley scream<br/>
cried for 15 minutes. I walked Kelly home, she needed her mom now. Kelly is<br/>
quiet and lets Ashley trample all over her.<br/>
<br/>
 We&#39;ve managed play dates and outings and all kinds of Ashley focus for years<br/>
now and still, she does not seem to have much fun here. I&#39;m looking at her<br/>
adult self in the future. She has many great traits. She is determined, she<br/>
knows her position, she creates elabotate plans and follows through with them.<br/>
She is passionate about her ideas. How then do we go about helping her be more<br/>
polite, respectful of others feelings? Had she heard Kelly say, no Ashley I do<br/>
not want to take my bracelet apart and repected that no, the resulting sadness<br/>
would not have followed. We respect her words. We model respect constantly.<br/>
She seems deaf to our words.<br/>
<br/>
Wow, I guess I needed to vent again about my daughter who throws us new<br/>
confounding pitches each week. Tim bought us a new car while I was away with 2<br/>
other HS moms and kids for camping, wow I&#39;m in the mini van club now. We will<br/>
continue to learn Beattles songs this week for a Friday night show. Tim is<br/>
looking forward to bringing his brother, 37 with Downs Syndrom, up for a<br/>
visit.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
<br/>
Mary H.</div>

&lt;&lt; Had she heard Kelly say, no Ashley I do<br/>

<br/>
This is so rough.<br/>
<br/>
Is she better when an adult is right with her?  I don&#39;t remember how old she <br/>
is.<br/>
<br/>
Does she have her own room and her own separate stuff?  My thought about the <br/>
bracelet (which certainly could be wrong) is based on some factors in my own <br/>
childhood with a very, very difficult cousin who lived with us.  Because she <br/>
felt nothing was really hers in the world, and that other people had things <br/>
she didn&#39;t, she was destructive.  And sometimes in that same way, getting <br/>
others to sabotage or destroy their own happiness so that she&#39;s not the one <br/>
who took the action (as she saw it).<br/>
<br/>
I felt sorry for her then and I do now, but I don&#39;t believe that to this day <br/>
she has anything of value, physical or sentimental.  She defined herself as a <br/>
person who didn&#39;t have enough, and made that come true.<br/>
<br/>
If Ashley is jealous, that&#39;s a neediness.  If she resents her brother is it <br/>
because she&#39;s crowded physically?  Is she having to share things with him she <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to share?  That seems too simplistic in a way, but maybe it&#39;s a <br/>
basic.  Sharing isn&#39;t necessary to the toothbrush-and-air level.  To what <br/>
level IS it necessary?  Different families have different levels of <br/>
closeness, whether imposed or voluntary or necessity.   Can she be given more <br/>
space?<br/>
<br/>
One of the things that surprised me and changed my whole perspective on <br/>
family life was the idea of a child being greatly mismatched with parents.  <br/>
We&#39;re fortunate that each of our children is recognizeably like one of us, or <br/>
in the case of Holly, has traits we recognize from both of us or other <br/>
relatives.  But what I read and heard people talk about a dozen years ago or <br/>
so (maybe someone here knows of books or a website) was about what happens if <br/>
two quiet parents have a very talkative child?  What if two outgoing, <br/>
talkative parents have an introverted and quiet-seeking child?  Sometimes the <br/>
parents try to change the child to the point of psychotherapy and drugs to <br/>
make him &quot;right.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
These ideas are being thrown out kind of as stabs in the dark.  Maybe they&#39;re <br/>
total misses.    But if you have a child who DOES have space, privacy, <br/>
possessions and isn&#39;t jealous of friends and neighbors (not always something <br/>
a family can engineer, I know) is it possibly that she&#39;s a mismatch for the <br/>
family?  And if so, is it possible you could find another adult or teen, <br/>
maybe who is a better match who could do things with her sometimes, let her <br/>
hang out with their family, give her some more focussed one-on-one time, a <br/>
place to vent, talk, be different?   Not for life, just maybe a year or <br/>
several years until she gets some more control of her impulses and some <br/>
better understanding of what she can do to make herself and others around her <br/>
more comfortable.  <br/>
<br/>
Because if the modelling and persuasion of the family isn&#39;t affecting her, <br/>
maybe someone else&#39;s method or description or view will make sense to her, <br/>
and you could appeal to that other person to try to give her what she&#39;s not <br/>
getting, or explain in a whole different way.  <br/>
<br/>
It might cost money.  You might have to &quot;hire a babysitter&quot; in a way, but it <br/>
might be well worth it.<br/>
<br/>
And if none of that makes a lick of sense in the current situation, let it <br/>
pass on by.<br/>
