Dear Cindy,<br/>
<br/>
On behalf of Holt Associates I recently completed the donation of John<br/>
Holt¹s papers and recordings to the Boston Public Library, where they will<br/>
cataloged by the special collection department and then open to the public.<br/>
However, the BPL was not interested in Holt¹s book collection. I have spent<br/>
several months giving some books away to friends and I have donated many<br/>
boxes of books to charity. I went through the remaining boxes and pulled out<br/>
books, and a few personal possessions, that are either hard to find or were<br/>
annotated, marked or signed by John Holt. There are also several books<br/>
signed by their authors to John Holt, often first editions.<br/>
<br/>
Of special interest to friends and scholars of Holt, there are some<br/>
instances where books contain pieces of paper or bent corners that John used<br/>
to mark passages and they have remained in place since his death. Some books<br/>
contain Holt¹s notes and comments on the text, as well. All these books<br/>
provide provocative clues into the mind of one of the most original<br/>
educators of the twentieth century. As homeschooling continues to grow,<br/>
interest in Holt has too. John Holt&#39;s interests and reading cover the gamut<br/>
from alternative energy to child care; politics to poetry; cartoons to<br/>
organic farming. Own a piece of educational and cultural history from the<br/>
previous century as well as get a physical connection to John Holt.<br/>
<br/>

Store. <br/>

Best wishes,<br/>
