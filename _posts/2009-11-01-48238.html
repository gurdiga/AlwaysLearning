<div id="ygrps-yiv-478977144">I just had to share:<br/>
<br/>
I am the work outside the home person in our family - the other day I came home exhausted and as I was trudging up the stairs to the kitchen with my armload of work stuff - lunch box, coat, bag, water bottle, etc. I walked right by Zac (15) sitting on the couch in the family room playing on his laptop (the garage is off the family room) He started saying something to me and I said I needed to put my stuff down first.<br/>
<br/>
He happily said &quot;But you&#39;re supposed to pay attention to ME when you get home.&quot;  I laughed and put my stuff down and paid attention to him.<br/>
<br/>
I thought it was great that he could ask for what he wanted in a light happy way - knowing and trusting that I would honor his needs and not belittle him for it.<br/>
<br/>
Also for the past 3 days he has been finding cartoons on You-Tube  - mostly Looney Toons - to share with me.  Which led to a discussion this morning about cartoons from when I was a kid (60&#39;s & 70&#39;s- then cartoons from 15 years later when my sister was a kid - to what is popular today.<br/>
