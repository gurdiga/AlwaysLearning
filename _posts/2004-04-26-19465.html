Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I was at a friend&#39;s house, and she decided to buy my book to give as a gift <br/>
to her Mom for Mother&#39;s Day (which is May 9th).  We thought that was a great <br/>
idea.<br/>
<br/>
I have some reusable cloth gift bags from an early business venture, so if <br/>
you order a book for Mother&#39;s Day, write Mother&#39;s Day in the business line of <br/>
the order form, and I&#39;ll put in a gift bag with the book for wrapping (or send <br/>
it wrapped to the mom- send an e-mail to let me know).<br/>
<br/>
If you no longer have your mom available to &quot;gift&quot; perhaps you&#39;d like to <br/>
donate a copy of HOMESCHOOLING REFLECTIONS  to your local library as a gift to <br/>
other moms. You can send me an e-mail to that effect, after placing your order, <br/>
and I can send it to the library you specify, with a donation notation in the <br/>
book if you&#39;d like.<br/>
<br/>
Or, if you&#39;d like to receive the book as a gift, send this e-mail on to the <br/>
person/people that &quot;gift&quot; you on that day!<br/>
<br/>
Yours,<br/>
Connie<br/>

ps - feel free to pass this e-mail onto other lists if you feel the urge! <br/>
