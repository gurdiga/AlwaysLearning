<br/>
Just had another conversation with my mother about homeschooling.  I <br/>
don&#39;t even bother explaining that we do &quot;nothing &quot; all day . . .   <br/>
Anyway, I happened to mention that homeschoolers get a discount at <br/>
Apple , and she said don&#39;t you have to get him set up for a charter <br/>
school this month?  And I said &quot;yeah, but I&#39;m liking this homeschooling <br/>
thing&quot; . . . and it went from there.  Basically &quot;everyone&quot; is concerned <br/>
for Steven, and he needs to go to school so that he can form &quot;bonds&quot; <br/>
and she thinks he needs someone else to teach him, &quot;someone who&#39;s been <br/>
trained&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The only good thing is that I think I stood up for myself very well, <br/>
and I did manage to offer reading materials, and point out that it <br/>
spoke volumes that she was unwilling to even accept any reading <br/>
materials.<br/>
<br/>
But I feel like crap when I fight with my mom.  And that wanting to <br/>
push him so that he&#39;s ahead of everybody (everywhere!) is creeping in . <br/>
. .<br/>
<br/>
On a happy note, I asked Steven to find the phone after I&#39;d paged it <br/>
the other day, and he asked &quot;How do I make it stop [beeping]?!?! &quot; I <br/>
said &quot;Press any key . . .&quot;  and he said, &quot;Ok, I pressed the &quot;and&quot; key.&quot; <br/>
  I&#39;m thinking . . . &quot;&&quot;??<br/>
<br/>
The phone has an &quot;end&quot; button.  He read that.  Or mis-read it, as the <br/>
case may be.  But he had to read it to mis-read it . . .<br/>

How much crowd control do you need with one or a few kids?<br/>

<br/>
I do!  I do!!<br/>
<br/>
I went to a pot luck in honor the rare visit of someone I&#39;d known from 2nd <br/>
grade through high school, and there were two others I&#39;d known since 2nd grade, <br/>
one I hung out with from 6th grade through part of college, my best friend <br/>
from 9th through high school, another I met in 9th grade whose older sister is in <br/>
contact with me at least once a year (though she lives in Virginia) and I had <br/>
lunch with her on an airport stopover in the summer, and... another friend <br/>
from Jr. High band (and high school).  <br/>
<br/>
We had a BLAST!!!<br/>
<br/>
I should shut up, then, right? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh.  Two of them had seen teachers I was wondering about (a history teacher <br/>
who was a jazz pianist for a second job, Pancracio Rael) and another had seen <br/>
our art teacher, Florencio Montoya, recently.  I was the one who had attended <br/>
and could report on the funeral of Jacqui Littlejohn, who had been one of our <br/>
English teachers and spiritual advisors.   I forgot to tell them that Holly and <br/>
I had spent half a day with Sally Gonzales, my fourth grade teacher (and one <br/>
other of those folks was in my class in 4th), following the funeral of the dad <br/>
of another friend of ours.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;<br/>
The training teachers get has more to do with crowd control than learning. <br/>
How much crowd control do you need with one or a few kids?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I learned a lot about learning.  Not so much about teaching.  But I did study <br/>
cognition and psychology.   Some of the crowd control stuff I learned on the <br/>
job, and I still find it useful!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not JUST being argumentative, I&#39;m just being confessionish.   And <br/>
friendwise, I&#39;m having a great month.  Momwise it&#39;s horrible, so at the moment I&#39;m <br/>
feeling huge waves of gratitude that I had a place to be other than the house <br/>
when I was little.  I would much rather wipe any of those teachers&#39; butts than <br/>
my mom&#39;s.<br/>

Sorry to hear the whole Mom-thing is so hard these days for you.  I&#39;ve seen recent comments in your posts about what taking care of your Mom is taking out of you, and thought of you.  That&#39;s such a hard place to be in.  Even worse when things between Mom and daughter weren&#39;t all they could been.  My own Mom went thru all that several years ago as she lived in to care for her own Mom until her death.  It&#39;s a huge job and takes a huge toll on everyone involved.  <br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t have any real insights to offer you, just wanted to say I was thinking about you and remembering how tough this had all been on my Mom.  I don&#39;t know if your Mom&#39;s expected to recover, or if this is something you&#39;re doing for her as an end of life thing, but I hope it all gets easier for you soon.<br/>
 <br/>

Thanks.  Who knows.  She was halfway off the bed when I got there this <br/>
morning, trying to stand up.  She might&#39;ve ended up on the floor again, third day in <br/>
a row, if I hadn&#39;t gotten there.    She wanted to get up.  <br/>
<br/>
I would cry if I knew the actual number of times she commanded me  I TOLD YOU <br/>
TO STAY ON THE BED during &quot;nap time&quot; when I was little.  I hated &quot;naptime&quot; <br/>
and rarely napped.  I stared at the ceiling a lot and learned to cross my eyes <br/>
and still focus so that the ceiling tile lines &quot;came down&quot; where I could touch <br/>
them.   I thought through all my lists and lyrics and made daydreams of me <br/>
being on Howdy Doody or Mickey Mouse Club, and I listened to my mom in the other <br/>
room, wishing she wasn&#39;t so mean.   <br/>
<br/>
Yet I didn&#39;t say STAY ON THE BED.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never been much of a sleeper.  Those naps weren&#39;t for me.  They were for <br/>
her.<br/>

********<br/>
 <br/>
All anyone has to do to make a difference in the world is be a little kinder, a little more loving, and try a little harder than the last generation.  You&#39;ve done more than that, just in being as kind and loving to your Mom as you wish she had been with you.  Even better is that you&#39;ve done such a great job of giving your kids the freedom and support you didn&#39;t get.  It sounds like you&#39;re being as true to yourself as your integrity requires, and that&#39;s the best anyone can do.  At some point in time it will get easier, but probably not before it gets harder.  <br/>
 <br/>
At least you get to plan your own naps now!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>OMG!  Can I ever relate, Sandra.  I can remember when my mom worked <br/>
nights and had to sleep during the day, so she made us lay down with <br/>
her.  I used to  stare at the pop-corn painted ceiling trying to find <br/>
shapes and animals, almost like looking at the clouds.  And I couldn&#39;t <br/>
sneak away because she had her arms around me and my sister.  It was <br/>
nice being close to her, but SO boring.<br/>
<br/>
I give you so much credit for taking care of your Mom.  My parents <br/>
invited my grandmother to live with them and now that she&#39;s having lots <br/>
of health problems all they do is complain about EVERYTHING she says, <br/>
doesn&#39;t say, does, and doesn&#39;t do.  We all have to keep reminding them <br/>
that someday, they&#39;ll be the ones who need our care and they should <br/>
either find some compassion or put her in a nursing home.  It&#39;s very <br/>
sad.  So I wish you lots of energy and emotional strength to get through <br/>
this time.  You really are doing the right thing.  How wonderful to have <br/>
the opportunity to show Kirby, Marty, and Holly how forgiveness and <br/>
compassion can shape a person&#39;s character. Everything my parents do for <br/>
my grandmother is done with seething resentment and  I hate that my <br/>
children have to see and hear that.    Good luck.   Heidi<br/>

I know how you feel.  When I pulled my kids out of the<br/>
private school they were going to and started<br/>
homeschooling the grief my family gave me.  They<br/>
finally accepted it as another &quot;crazy&quot; thing that<br/>
Shellie is doing.  I am the one who always does the<br/>
&quot;crazy&quot; stuff you know.  I went yesterday to do the<br/>
polls for election day.  One of the other workers<br/>
asked me if we would put the girls into school when<br/>
they got older and my reply was &quot;I&#39;m don&#39;t think so<br/>
because we are having way too much fun now.&quot;  She<br/>
looked at me like I was off the deep end. LOL<br/>
It is hard to get them to understand that you are<br/>
always learning, not just when you have a work book in<br/>
front of you.<br/>
