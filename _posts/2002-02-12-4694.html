I&#39;ve thought for years about a set of 365 &quot;to do today&quot; cards--a year&#39;s worth <br/>
of unschooling in a box.  Do the cards in whatever order you want, repeat all <br/>
you want to or not.  Nobody would take a whole year to be ignoring the cards <br/>
and doing even cooler stuff without them, I figure.  I think of doing that, a <br/>
math book, and a book of essays.  <br/>
<br/>
The math book would be not really a math book, but directions on how to use a <br/>
math book wrong, kind of.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-449283051">Sandra, I was thinking.  In order to start organizing your thoughts, you could start a paid subscription email list.  Once a week you could send some ideas, tips, movie suggestions etc.  Over time you would have enough to write a book.  You wouldn&#39;t have to spend the time thinking up a <br/>
full years worth of ideas, there would be no out-of-pocket expenses and we would get the benefits sooner.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Unless I haven&#39;t seen all the resources yet, I don&#39;t see what you already have and do as the same as what I was thinking of.  I see what you currently do as mentoring.  What I was talking about was actually putting a &quot;teaching&quot; style course together.  Some people need to feel like they are actively learning, doing something constructive, something productive.  As you mentioned, a lot of people drop out of unschooling because they are not patient.  <br/>
<br/>
The other problem for me is organizing all of your wisdom into a workable plan.  You mention so much in passing and in answering specific questions. It flows.  Well, to my simple way of thinking it flows right through me!  At least it is not going over my head. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I need a *concrete* visual image in order to make it work.  If I don&#39;t have that, the next best thing are steps (with guidelines)to lead me.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, you are a gifted teacher.  Open up a classroom and teach us how to unschool *your* way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1712363207">I&#39;d like to read a book entitled &quot;Keeping Kids Learning&quot;.  Kind of like the book &quot;Keeping Kids Reading&quot; by Mary Leonhardt.  It gave a lot of good ideas on how to figure out what types of books your kids would be interested in, how to feed their interest and how to create good memory moments around books. <br/>
<br/>
We could all help with the research for a book like this.  What it would take would be the input from people whose kids like different things and what resources they use to satisfy their children&#39;s interests.  <br/>
<br/>
If nothing else, it would be good information for all of us to share.  Maybe we could use the database feature available with this list.  I would be happy to do the data entry.  <br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s think about how other information that we share could be collected and organized.<br/>

I would like to see another &quot;unschooling handbook&quot; that got much more into<br/>
the philosophical side of trusting children and letting go. Seeing what they<br/>
are learning and how rather than what parent&#39; WANT them to learn. Maybe with<br/>
lots of letters/postings/essays from &quot;rabid&quot; unschoolers. (That&#39;s my term<br/>

Maybe a chapter on FAQ&#39;s or each chapter an answer to a FAQ.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Pat, I&#39;ve been unconsciously trying to do that with Sandra&#39;s wisdom for 7<br/>
years. ;-) I&#39;m an engineer. I love orderly approaches to learning. I<br/>
secretly lust after Calvert ;-) My advantage has been that I&#39;ve had Sandra<br/>
interpretters over the years who were halfway between her thinking and mine<br/>
and could translate things into something I could understand.<br/>
<br/>
It takes lots of work to get beyond linear A to B thinking and think in<br/>
terms of expansion.<br/>
<br/>
For example, I tried to get &quot;Strewing their paths&quot; to match up with my idea<br/>
of learning as leading kids to a specific point. So strewing was like<br/>
dropping a trail of bread crumbs to lead an animal into a cage.<br/>
<br/>
But now I see strewing as each strewn bit creating a little path into the<br/>
world that my daughter can travel or not, explore thoroughly or just a<br/>
little. The strewing expands her world rather than leading her any place in<br/>
particular.<br/>
<br/>
What did you do with the kids over summer vacation? Or when they were<br/>
younger? Or anytime you weren&#39;t doing school?<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s nothing wrong with planning or scheduling things. But the plan<br/>
should be your slave, not your master. It should help you live life, not<br/>
dictate how you or your kids live it.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps practice thinking in terms of living life in the here and now rather<br/>
than trying to get someplace.<br/>

you&#39;re not Sandra.  NO ONE can unschool just like someone else. It&#39;s all<br/>

<br/>
Helen Hegener (who might be reading here, some sometimes &lt;g&gt;) <br/>
discussed an online class they would sponsor that I could teach.  I <br/>
balked, saying it seemed just wrong.  But I also sketched up a course <br/>

It seems wrong.<br/>

book &quot;Keeping Kids Reading&quot; by Mary Leonhardt.  It gave a lot of good ideas <br/>
on how to figure out what types of books your kids would be interested in, <br/>
how to feed their interest and how to create good memory moments around <br/>
books. **<br/>
<br/>
I love Mary Leonhardt&#39;s books. They&#39;re full of sensible stuff that <br/>
contradicts the common wisdom. But not a lot of the stuff in Keeping Kids <br/>
Reading has been actually useful to me personally, because so much of it is <br/>
about how to keep school from ruining your kids. (Same problem with Coloring <br/>
Outside the Lines by Schenk, which I also recommend).<br/>
<br/>
Just another comment to add to the mix, not sure if it means anything. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1082155290">**The same as when a child expresses an interest in taking lessons, you find <br/>
sign them up for a class.**<br/>
<br/>
Maybe. Maybe not. :)<br/>
<br/>
I usually don&#39;t jump to sign a kid up for a class at the first glimmering of <br/>
interest. I often drag my feet about &quot;signing up&quot; while working on figuring <br/>
out *with* the child what truly is the best way for that child to learn <br/>
whatever it is they&#39;re wanting to learn. Sometimes it does turn out to be <br/>
classes. Often it&#39;s not.<br/>
<br/>
School and classes and teachers and all that are so ubiquitous in our society <br/>
that even my totally unschooled kids can&#39;t help thinking sometimes that those <br/>
are the only ways to learn anything. <br/>
<br/>
My kids (and I think most people in most situations) learn most things better <br/>
in mentoring relationships or tutoring relationships than in &quot;classes&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
A long time ago on AOL there existed for a short time a Homeschooling <br/>
Academy. It was an attempt by long time homeschoolers, AOL homeschool forum <br/>
regulars and volunteers, to provide something like an ongoing conference <br/>
online. Sandra and a few others held &quot;classes&quot; on unschooling. A lot of <br/>
people came wanting to be told exactly how to unschool. I&#39;m not sure we ever <br/>
figured out what to tell them in an hour that would fill that need.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Unschooling *Sandra&#39;s way* may very well not work for you.,<br/>
you&#39;re not Sandra.  NO ONE can unschool just like someone else. It&#39;s all<br/>
relative. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And it has more to do with the kids than the mom.  <br/>
<br/>
I had no way of knowing that Holly would really love 1930&#39;s music.  I rented <br/>
paper moon because one day we were mixed up about change for a $20, and which <br/>
way it would go, with her needing to give me some money back for me to give <br/>
her her allowance and some money I had borrowed, but she would keep the $20.  <br/>
It got so crazy and funny that I tried to tell her about the $20 bill scam <br/>
from Paper Moon, and couldn&#39;t remember it exactly, so I rented the movie.  <br/>
Holly LOVED the music.  <br/>
<br/>
So for Christmas I ordered a CD with songs from that.  We discovered Irving <br/>
Berlin (&quot;Let&#39;s Have Another Cup of Coffee&quot;) also wrote Annie Get your Gun, <br/>
which Holly knew had discovered at a friend&#39;s house.<br/>
<br/>
We rented Top Hat, because &quot;Cheek to Cheek&quot; was on her CD.  She LOVED <br/>
that--we kept it ten days.  So I ordered a CD of Fred Astaire doing all <br/>
Irving Berlin songs.<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere in the depths of the Wizard of Oz video was something about <br/>
&quot;Everybody Sing,&quot; an old Judy Garland movie.  Holly wanted to see it; we <br/>
found it and rented it.<br/>
<br/>
One song on there, &quot;Why? Because&quot; (I think it&#39;s called), Holly loved, and she <br/>
wanted the lyrics.  The lyrics weren&#39;t online (or I didn&#39;t find them) but I <br/>
DID find an ad for a Judy Garland CD collection of stuff from MGM movies, <br/>
with that song on it.  AND there were lots of songs from Annie Get your Gun <br/>
there.  We ordered it.<br/>
<br/>
Tuesday  night was a friend&#39;s birthday party, and we went to buy him a DVD.  <br/>
Bladerunner, we thought (endedstory, were some scenes with... JUDY GARLAND!  <br/>
So two days ago Holly saw film of two songs from the movie, with Judy <br/>
Garland.  It was finished with another actress instead, because Judy Garland <br/>
got sick and couldn&#39;t finish the movie.<br/>
<br/>
This morning, the Judy Garland CD came.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(I should keep this in Holly&#39;s diary, to show the speed with which this <br/>
Irving Berlin &quot;unit study&quot; came on.)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the bid deal:  In my whole life I have had a great aversion to that <br/>
style of music.  Keith pressed me to watch some Fred Astaire stuff, and he <br/>
was right, it was nice, but I was still tepid.   I&#39;ve never liked Judy <br/>
Garland much at all.  I didn&#39;t realize what all Irving Berlin had done.  I <br/>
never knew anything about Annie Get your Gun until Holly told me about it.<br/>
<br/>
So this wasn&#39;t something I taught Holly.  It was me facilitating her <br/>
interest, connecting dots as they appeared one or two at a time, encouraging <br/>
her, enabling her, and sharing her interest.  Now I&#39;m actually pretty <br/>
interested, and we&#39;ll probably look for some Fanny Brice stuff, because she&#39;s <br/>
the other singer on the &quot;Why? Because&quot; number.<br/>
<br/>
Oh--Shirley Temple figured into this some too, but was in parallel (similar <br/>
music and time period).<br/>
<br/>
Holly will know more about the 1930&#39;s (she asks LOTS of questions about the <br/>
depression) by the time she&#39;s grown than I&#39;ve ever known or ever wanted to.<br/>
<br/>
Oh!  We&#39;re reading a book called &quot;The Doll People,&quot; and this morning there <br/>
was a mention of Amelia Earhart.  &quot;Who?&quot; says Holly.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well, in the 1930&#39;s...&quot;  And I told her I knew a song about her, and sang <br/>
part of the chorus, and promised to sing the whole thing sometime when we&#39;re <br/>
in the car.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if Holly will get tired of the 30&#39;s soon, or if she&#39;ll grow up <br/>
to be a jazz singer or an economic theorist or biographer of Irving Berlin or <br/>
absolutely none of the above.  I&#39;m going to treat her the very same way in <br/>
any case.<br/>
<br/>
(She&#39;s in the other room saying &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&#39;s a little BOY,&quot; and <br/>
I&#39;ve just pulled up a website with photos of Little Lord Fountelroy suits.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks for sharing Holly&#39;s musical journey. When I was in high school, I <br/>
developed an absolute passion for Fred Astaire and movie musicals. (And I <br/>
wondered why nobody thought I was &quot;cool&quot; :-D) I collected songs, sheet <br/>
music, movies, posters and memoribilia. I was probably the only 16 year old <br/>
with a crush on a skinny, balding guy who was in his prime 45 years earlier.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1649319842">We have listened to an unabridged audio of The Doll People a couple of<br/>
times and just love that story!  It has lots of little details that I<br/>
find amusing (such as, Barbies never take the oath), besides raising lots<br/>
of issues to discuss with kids.  I was watching VH1 100 greatest songs<br/>
and 9yog joined me.  They chose R-E-S-P-E-C-T as performed by Aretha<br/>
Franklin for #2.  I told her that was the same song that the doll people<br/>
sang.  Two dots to connect!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the Unschooling Curriculum should be &quot;Connect the Dots&quot;.<br/>

It&#39;s been fun talking with her about the depression.  People were SO poor <br/>
that the fantasy of people wearing nice clothes, and being in <br/>
state-of-the-art art-deco resorts (made of a few plywood sets, probably) in <br/>
all KINDS of movies from the Marx Brothers to musicals to murder mysteries <br/>
was as good for them as Star Wars was for us.  People who could afford to fly <br/>
or cruise somewhere and hire a car with a chauffeur to take them to this <br/>
poshest-of-posh (imaginary)hotel could be looked at by people who could <br/>
afford a dime to go to a movie.<br/>

I didn&#39;t get that aspect of it at all  in the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s.<br/>
