<div id="ygrps-yiv-1076967993">No, it&#39;s really not necessary to cover all subjects. In fact, it&#39;s <br/>
really not necessary to cover *any* subjects. That&#39;s the heart of <br/>
unschooling--not &quot;covering&quot; subjects at all. Cover them with what, <br/>
anyway? We live our lives and let our kids live their lives, learning <br/>
about whatever interests them, and ignore the entire concept of &quot;subjects.&quot;<br/>
