&lt;&lt; What do you do when they start lashing out? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well I believe you have the right to protect yourself, and in this case a <br/>
small child is fairly easy to protect yourself from if you hold them. Gently <br/>
but firmly hold their hands or body so they can not strike you. Talk calmly <br/>
and gently, telling them that when they can calm down you will set them down, <br/>
or let go.<br/>
You can carry that person to a part of the house that is soothing. Tell them <br/>
you will not allow your body to be hurt by anyone, and that until they calm <br/>
down you will not let go.<br/>
Or you will not be near them at that moment.<br/>
You have the right to be safe.<br/>
From everything you&#39;ve said I really feel that he has some food sensitivies <br/>
that may intensify the problem.<br/>
Have you noticed stronger reactions when he eats certain things. Look for <br/>
dyes, they are big culprits for some sensitive children.<br/>
Chocolate, citrus fruits, strawberries, peanut butter, bananas, MSG, Red#40 <br/>
and sugar are common problems..... maybe watch for that.<br/>
