<div id="ygrps-yiv-415074162">No, not much. Long shoes help so that there is room in<br/>
the toe box to place the extra sock when you have to<br/>
pull it down off of the toes.<br/>
<br/>
I think the socks are worse than they used to be. <br/>
Men&#39;s socks seem :-) to be a little better than<br/>
women&#39;s.  Kids are the worst.  I get good socks my<br/>
size and in boy colors and shrink them for Roy, as<br/>
they don&#39;t come (that I have found) in his in the<br/>
middle size.  <br/>
