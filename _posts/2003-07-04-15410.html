<div id="ygrps-yiv-828025113">Hi All,<br/>
I haven&#39;t been posting much lately because we&#39;ve been in big <br/>
transitions around here.  <br/>
Tamzin is going to school in September.  All (and I mean ALL) of <br/>
the homeschoolers we know are choosing school in the <br/>
autumn.  Tamzin doesn&#39;t want to be the only homeschooler.  <br/>
She&#39;s afraid she&#39;ll be bored and won&#39;t see her friends very often <br/>
(this has happened with other friends that have gone back to <br/>
school).  <br/>
Luckily, I found a school about 15 minutes away that is (I think) <br/>
going to be a good place to spend 6 hours a day.  It&#39;s very small - <br/>
24 students aged 5 to 13.  It&#39;s modelled on a Sudbury school, so <br/>
at least she will be in an enviroment that allows her to make <br/>
choices for herself and be an individual.  She&#39;s taking summer <br/>
art classes there now and is really enjoying it, so I guess this is <br/>
the right move for her, but I&#39;m still sad about it :-(<br/>
Anyway, I guess we&#39;re not unschoolers anymore starting in <br/>
September &lt;sniff&gt; so I will be unsubscribing and wishing you all <br/>
well.  If school doesn&#39;t work out, I&#39;ll be back in touch.  I&#39;ll miss the <br/>
list :-(<br/>

sounds a nice school.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think you necessarily stop thinking like an unschooler just because<br/>
you make a choice to use a school.  Personally, I would still want to be<br/>
here and would hope you would still have me even though one or all of my<br/>
children chose school.  If you haven&#39;t read it you might like to get hold of<br/>
Guerilla Learning by Grace Llewellyn and Amy Silver.  It advocates something<br/>
akin to an unschooling attitude even if your children go to school.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and I hope everything goes well for you.<br/>

<br/>
Though I wish she were still home, Caroline chose a similar school last<br/>
fall.  The Sudbury model IS unschooling, just away from home.  My dd (8.5)<br/>
thrived there. Her school had 14 students 8-19.   She is extremely social.<br/>
I still consider myself us unschoolers, and I still hang out here and read.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s nice to have a place where others parent the same way I do and I don&#39;t<br/>
have to feel like the oddball.  No need to unsubscribe!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh no!  I&#39;ll always be an unschooler at heart (always have been) <br/>
but my feeling is that this list is for people truly practicing <br/>
unschooling in their daily lives and, unfortunately, that won&#39;t be <br/>
Tamzin and I in September.  I just read Guerilla Learning, thanks <br/>
for the recommendation though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-71883695">My 14yo daughter has also asked to go to school this fall. She only wants<br/>
to go to school to meet more friends and have fun.<br/>
Since I signed her up she has changed her mind a couple times. She seems<br/>
to be sticking with the not going choice again.<br/>
I was bummed that she would consider going but decided to let her. I was<br/>
even more bummed when I asked for words of wisdom from the unschoolers I<br/>
consider so wise and got nothing. <br/>
I found a book at the library I thought I could get my daughter to read<br/>
because I know she is struggling with this choice now. <br/>
I ended up reading it myself. I now feel better and can hopefully deal<br/>
with her going to school if she chooses to go again.<br/>
My daughter began reading it but isn&#39;t as thrilled with it as I was. She<br/>
hasn&#39;t gotten through the first chapter yet so I&#39;ll have to wait to see<br/>
if she&#39;s going to get as much out of it as I have. <br/>
Maybe you&#39;ve read it; if not, maybe you should think about it. <br/>
