~~~<br/>
<br/>
Most theme parks will let you wait in line for big people rides with your <br/>
kids, and let one parent ride first while the other parent stays with the kids at <br/>
the front of the line.  When the first parent to ride gets off, they take the <br/>
kids out the exit with them.  <br/>
<br/>
And don&#39;t try to see it all.  :)<br/>

&lt;&lt;  Anyway, do any of you have some good tips about small kids and <br/>
theme parks?  I really want it to be a great day for everyone so I want <br/>
to be ready to handle anything. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When my kids were little, I would get some handkerchiefs (like men&#39;s <br/>
handkerchiefs you can buy at thrift stores or department stores) and write their name, <br/>
phone number, my name, and tie it around their necks like a kerchief.  It <br/>
served to keep me from being horribly afraid of them getting lost or hurt and not <br/>
being quickly identified.  Especially if you have a cellphone, then if they <br/>
get lost someone can help them get found.<br/>
<br/>
Keep small snacks with you so you don&#39;t have to spend $5 just because <br/>
someone&#39;s a little hungry.  Don&#39;t go on roller coasters right after lunch. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t let anyone take his or her only favorite thing (keychain, hat, <br/>
sunglasses) because it might get lost.  Go with serviceable secondary stuff if they <br/>
take stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
SUNSCREEN.  Chapstick.  (Maybe those are more New Mexico recommendations. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A camera.<br/>
<br/>
A stroller.  You can carry stuff in the stroller and not get so tired, and <br/>
I&#39;ve never known anyone to rob a stroller by the line by a ride.  Even if you <br/>
just carry water and extra clothes (someone might upchuck), it might be a good <br/>
deal to have.  I took a stroller even after I had kids &quot;too big,&quot; because the <br/>
youngest often needed a nap while the others were going strong, and that helped.<br/>
<br/>
Having two families (at least two moms?) is wonderful, especially if one or <br/>
more adults is willing to go on scarier rides with the bigger kids while others <br/>
wait in the shade or go to the bathroom (so everybody doesn&#39;t have to trek to <br/>
the bathroom as one big gang).<br/>
<br/>
I hope you have lots of fun!<br/>
<br/>
We should go to the local place here this year.  We haven&#39;t for two years.  <br/>
That&#39;s too long.<br/>

<br/>
OH!  GOOD POINT!<br/>
Forgot the &quot;what you&#39;re wearing&quot; thing.<br/>
<br/>
And one trick my mom had was we had a default meeting place if people got <br/>
lost, and we never had to use them, but the drill was &quot;if you get lost go to the <br/>
merry go round&quot; or if indoors in a big store, the escalator.    At a really <br/>
big park &quot;the merry go round&quot; will be too far (we were never at anything bigger <br/>
than an amusement park in Ft. Worth, or a carnival or state fair), but you <br/>
could have a place each time you get separated that you will meet.  Something <br/>
they can see from a distance so it&#39;s a comfort, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
You probably won&#39;t need to use it, but they&#39;ll feel empowered, I think.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1661912719">All great suggestions.  We were at Wal-Mart yesterday, but will have to <br/>
do a quick trip before we go to get some matching sweatshirts for <br/>
everyone.  And Canada&#39;s Wonderland has a huge &quot;mountain&quot; at the center <br/>
of the park, so that can be our meeting place should we need one. <br/>
 Perhaps having a bad weather forecast will be to our benefit since even <br/>
less people will be there.  Now I guess my biggest challenge will be to <br/>
stay relaxed so everyone else is too.  Sometimes I can think of such <br/>
awful situations that &quot;could&quot; happen to my kids that I could probably <br/>
give Stephen King a run for his money should I write them down.  But <br/>
then I tell myself, &quot;Don&#39;t borrow trouble!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure it will be great and all the more memorable if there is thunder <br/>
and lightening that day.  <br/>
<br/>
Have a great weekend, everyone!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi Heidi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m originally from Canada, and though I haven&#39;t been to Canada&#39;s<br/>
Wonderland in a long time--like over ten years--I now live in<br/>
Southern California and have passes for my son Ben (who&#39;s now 4) to<br/>
Disneyland, and with Nick (who&#39;s now 1) to Legoland, and Universal<br/>
Studios.  We love going to these places because it&#39;s such a fun<br/>
family day, and they usually have rides/shows/activities that appeal<br/>
to both small kids and adults.<br/>
<br/>
My advice is to have a good stroller that can hold a lot of stuff. <br/>
You won&#39;t have to carry it, you can leave it on the stroller.  If<br/>
small kids get sleepy, they have a place to crash.  When we first<br/>
started going, I was wary of leaving the stroller to go on a ride or<br/>
to a show, worried that someone might steal my bag or my stuff.  But<br/>
the fact is, at these places there are so many strollers and bags,<br/>
and everyone is leaving them to go on rides.  They even have stroller<br/>
parking areas where you can &quot;park&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
We always try to do the kids rides first thing while they (and the<br/>
grown-ups) have lots of energy and they are fresh.  I try to bring<br/>
some snacks and some little (pocket sized) toys for the kids to play<br/>
with while waiting in line.  It might be good to think up some fun<br/>
word games or other activities to do in case you get stuck waiting<br/>
for a while.  <br/>
<br/>
After lunch, my kids always get a little draggy, so this is when we<br/>
try to do a show, or a longish sit-down ride so the kids (and<br/>
grown-ups) can have a rest.  For example, we always do the back-lot<br/>
studio tour at Universal Studios near the end of the day.  It is<br/>
about an hour long, and is interesting for both kids and adults. <br/>
I&#39;ve nursed Nick on this ride many times.  Ben&#39;s fallen asleep on it<br/>
many times.  So if Canada&#39;s Wonderland has a kind of slower ride like<br/>
this,  it may be a good one for when the kids get a little pooped.  <br/>
<br/>
Did I mention to bring snacks?  No one has fun if they&#39;re<br/>
grumpy-hungry, (adults included).  If they give you trouble with<br/>
bringing food in, just say it&#39;s for the baby.<br/>
<br/>
Even if your kids are out of diapers, I would bring some wet wipes. <br/>
Chances are you or the kids will be eating something sticky, and<br/>
touching everything--they are just handy to have.  Maybe you already<br/>
do this, but I&#39;d throw in changes of clothes for the younger kids,<br/>
just in case.  You never know when they&#39;ll fall in a fountain, or<br/>
throw up, or have a diaper blow out. <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t remember if Wonderland has characters?  If they do, you might<br/>
want to get some blank books ahead of time.  I know older kids love<br/>
to go all over Disneyland and get autographs from Mickey, Donald,<br/>
Goofy, and all the characters.  Disneyland charges an arm and a leg<br/>
for the autograph books, and you can get them much cheaper outside<br/>
the park.  Don&#39;t know if your kids would be into that though.  <br/>
<br/>
I try to remember that the reason I am there is to have fun.  It is<br/>
easy to get really hyped up, stressed out, and feel ripped off,<br/>
because you are spending a fair amount of money.  I think it is best<br/>
to start the day with a focus of having fun as a family, even if you<br/>
only make it on one or two rides.  It isn&#39;t about how many rides you<br/>
can go on.  You are there to have fun.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh, and bring your camera...we too often forget ours!   <br/>
<br/>
And don&#39;t forget to check where you parked.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope that helped.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-628046963">&lt;&lt; We&#39;re heading to Canada&#39;s Wonderland amusement park this weekend. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Cool!  We&#39;re live just 10 minutes from Wonderland and have season&#39;s passes!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Anyway, do any of you have some good tips about small kids and theme<br/>
parks?  I really want it to be a great day for everyone so I want to be<br/>
ready to handle anything. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My daughter Alyssa is 10 and is our resident Wonderland &quot;expert&quot;.  She<br/>
*loves* roller coasters.  I read her your email she had a couple things to<br/>
say.  The bridge by the mountain is a good meeting spot.  If you just say<br/>
&quot;the mountain&quot;, you&#39;ll never find one another because it&#39;s way too big.  ;-)<br/>
She also recommends that the kids get a wristband near the entrance.  At<br/>
least the older ones who will be big enough to ride the bigger rides.  That<br/>
way they don&#39;t have to keep getting height checks at each ride station, they<br/>
can just show their wristband and walk right on.  Drinks & snacks are a good<br/>
idea, food is expensive.  But you can&#39;t leave without getting a funnel cake!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s great that you&#39;re going with another family &#39;cause then you can split<br/>
up if the older kids want to spend some time on the bigger rides.  My only<br/>
other tip is to try to relax and follow the kids&#39; leads.  If they want to do<br/>
the same ride over and over, it&#39;s okay.  You don&#39;t need to hike around the<br/>
entire park and see every sight to have a great day.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve found their website but if you want to check out the<br/>
rides and a map of the place before you go check it out:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.canadas-wonderland.com/">http://www.canadas-wonderland.com/</a>  Go to the Plan a Visit section and the<br/>
map is there.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!!  I&#39;ll be thinking about you guys.  :-)<br/>

of the cute whale-shaped strollers.  While our backs were turned, looking at<br/>
an exhibit, someone stole it.  I was so grateful I hadn&#39;t put my good camera<br/>
into it, as I was *just* thinking about doing so!<br/>
<br/>
Another time, ALSO at Sea World, a pickpocket stole my other camera, right<br/>
off my shoulder.  There were two of them working the parking lot together,<br/>
one of whom was trying to attract people to look at a clipboard covered in<br/>
pictures of &quot;missing children.&quot;  I blasted on by the guy, but my dd stopped<br/>
to talk to him.  In the instant I turned to call her, the other one must<br/>
have cut the strap of my camera and took it.<br/>

And one trick my mom had was we had a default meeting place if people got <br/>
lost, and we never had to use them, but the drill was &quot;if you get lost go to <br/>
the <br/>
merry go round&quot; or if indoors in a big store, the escalator.    At a really <br/>
big park &quot;the merry go round&quot; will be too far (we were never at anything <br/>
bigger <br/>
than an amusement park in Ft. Worth, or a carnival or state fair), but you <br/>
could have a place each time you get separated that you will meet.  Something <br/>
they can see from a distance so it&#39;s a comfort, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
<br/>
And, most parks have a &quot;lost child&quot; procedure.  I personally wouldn&#39;t ask a <br/>
kid younger than 8 to find their way to a specific location, but instead tell <br/>
them to approach anyone who works for the park and ask for help finding mommy.<br/>

You have had bad luck at Sea World!  I haven&#39;t taken my kids there<br/>
(yet).  But I&#39;ll be careful when I do.  Do you live near Sea World?<br/>

&gt; We went to Sea World in San Diego when my dd was a toddler, and<br/>
&gt; rented one<br/>
&gt; of the cute whale-shaped strollers.  While our backs were turned,<br/>
&gt; looking at<br/>
&gt; an exhibit, someone stole it.  I was so grateful I hadn&#39;t put my<br/>
&gt; good camera<br/>
&gt; into it, as I was *just* thinking about doing so!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Another time, ALSO at Sea World, a pickpocket stole my other<br/>
&gt; camera, right<br/>
&gt; off my shoulder.  There were two of them working the parking lot<br/>
&gt; together,<br/>
&gt; one of whom was trying to attract people to look at a clipboard<br/>
&gt; covered in<br/>
&gt; pictures of &quot;missing children.&quot;  I blasted on by the guy, but my dd<br/>
&gt; stopped<br/>
&gt; to talk to him.  In the instant I turned to call her, the other one<br/>
&gt; must<br/>
&gt; have cut the strap of my camera and took it.<br/>

&gt; I really hate Sea World &lt;ggg&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-97319622">Our very first day of homeschooling, the day the rest of the kids went <br/>
back to school and my kids didn&#39;t, we went to Sea World. It was a <br/>
little bit drizzly that day, unusual for mid-September in Southern <br/>
California, and there was hardly anybody there. We spent an hour in the <br/>
Shark Encounter - with nobody else there. It was awesome.<br/>
<br/>
We then went to the beach every single day for the next three weeks. <br/>
And I admit I chose the route to go past their old school so they&#39;d <br/>
realize that THEY were going to the beach while their school-friends <br/>
were in class.<br/>
<br/>
The beach was uncrowded, too. Just some moms and their babies and <br/>
toddlers and they all went home around lunch time and we had one <br/>
glorious afternoon after another!!<br/>
