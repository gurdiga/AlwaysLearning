<div id="ygrps-yiv-50608700">I am looking for ideas on how to meet the needs of my 7 year old <br/>
<br/>
I am a morning person.  She is a night owl.  She likes to play video<br/>
games much of the day, which is fine (although I need to remind myself<br/>
of that often), but by default that means we don&#39;t spend much of the<br/>
day together. I can hear you telling me that I should be playing the<br/>
games with her.  You are right of course and I do try, but I am not a<br/>
gamer.  I also invite her to do things with me, but she would rather<br/>
play.  The times that she does want to spend with me are after I have<br/>
put the youngest to bed (which I can see why), but since I am a<br/>
morning person, I am usually exhausted when that time rolls around and<br/>
I just want to crash.<br/>
<br/>
She is also a physical touch person, and I am not so much.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions on how I can meet her needs?<br/>
<br/>
Also, is it common that, at least at first (new to unschooling) and<br/>
when they are young that the more you try and meet their needs the<br/>
more needs they seem to have?  I am guessing this is a common thing,<br/>
but it seems to drain my energy fast.<br/>
<br/>
What do you do to keep your energy up?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a bunch.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2028520160">You&#39;ll get a lot of great info on this list.  I usually just lurk but<br/>
I thought I&#39;d pipe in here.  <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t consider myself much of a gamer, but I have a son who is.  I<br/>
realized from reading on this list that it was me who would have to<br/>
change.  I&#39;m still not a &quot;gamer&quot; per say but I have found games that<br/>
we both love to play.  Guitar hero, dance/dance revolution, elite beat<br/>
agents (give em a try, they are FUN!).  I also go with him to gaming<br/>
stores and rental places and listen to him and see what he likes. <br/>
There&#39;s also gaming magazines that are fun to flip through together. <br/>
I also hang with him and fold laundry or work on a puzzle w dd nearby<br/>
(which he&#39;ll even stop and come puzzle with us...not that that&#39;s my<br/>
intention) and we converse or he shares what&#39;s going on with me. <br/>
<br/>
She might also like webkins, you could both pick one up and get started?? <br/>
<br/>
Think outside the box...<br/>

<br/>
Could you brush her hair, rub or scratch her back?  Could you  hold  <br/>
hands with her sometimes when you&#39;re near anyway?  Like walking from  <br/>
the parking lot?<br/>
