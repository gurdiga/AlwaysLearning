<div id="ygrps-yiv-307376782">&quot; I have to say I am glad I was picked as<br/>
the normal mom.  :)  sometimes you are not sure which one you are. LOL&quot;<br/>
<br/>
HA! MY kids decided *I* was the crazy Mom and they wouldn&#39;t be able to<br/>
handle a &quot;normal&quot; Mom so I am forbidden to ever participate in that<br/>
show. :)<br/>
It probably didn&#39;t help diffuse my &quot;crazy&quot; image when I jumped in the<br/>
bathtub with Jalen and Sierra last week...fully clothed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-151967971">LOL... Now I know why I love  this list... other people that are fun crazy  and don&#39;t follow rules... some recent silly stuff we have done include:<br/>
   <br/>
  a bath tub full of jello<br/>
  a snow ball fight inside the car<br/>
  a muddy puddle war in WalMarts parking lot<br/>
  Letting my 4yr old put make up on me while we waited for our meal at a local &quot;upscale&quot; Mexican restaurant ( she also spoke only Spanish the whole time which would not be that weird except she only knows words she learned from Dora the Explorer and she used none of them correctly just strung them all together :) <br/>
   <br/>
  anyone else want to share some wacky adventures?  to show my kids I am not alone in my wackyness!!<br/>
