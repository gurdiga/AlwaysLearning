&gt; ...   Sandra, thank you for your words about unschooling and replacing <br/>
&gt; &quot;teaching&quot; with &quot;learning&quot;.  I think people might think it&#39;s semantics <br/>
&gt; but I think you are right. ... [snip]<br/>

I don&#39;t mean to beat a dead horse,  but I think there is nothing more <br/>
important than clarifying the difference between the <br/>
teaching/educating/schooling syndrome and learning.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the best writing on this differentiation has, for a number of <br/>
years, come from Dr Roland Meighan in the U.K his book &quot;Comparing <br/>
Learning Systems&quot; exemplifies the difference.  Manish and Shilpa Jain <br/>
(India) have also put some emphasis on learning as an &quot;alternative to <br/>
education.&quot;   It was also implied by Ivan Illich in &quot;Deschooling <br/>
Society&quot; and books by John Holt and others.<br/>
Their point is that the t/e/s syndrome is about transferring things <br/>
chosen and known by some adults to young people.  &quot;Learning&quot; implies <br/>
building on each individual&#39;s  curiosity, interest, ability, and <br/>
motivation -- unschooling.  Freedom to learn is the core of democracy.  <br/>
The e/t/s syndrome is the key to maintaining the status quo of the <br/>
dominator paradigm  -- authoritarianism, materialism, self-interest, <br/>
competition and hierarchy.<br/>
<br/>
It is the core of the Gaian Paradigm that recognizes the equality of <br/>
all elements of the cosmos including each individual human.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The equality of all elements of the cosmos&quot; is quite a human  <br/>
construct, isn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
It would have to ignore all animal behaviors, social systems of  <br/>
primates, storage of food for winter, and would pretty much do away  <br/>
with respect for experience and usefulness, wouldn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like the idea of &quot;education&quot; but I love the idea of  <br/>
learning.   Still, rejecting attachment to the concepts of teaching  <br/>
and education is a long, long way from suggesting &quot;the equality of  <br/>
all elements.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Individual humans aren&#39;t equal.  It&#39;s the favorite myth of the United  <br/>
States, but it&#39;s a myth, an idea, a principle and not an objective  <br/>
reality.<br/>
