<div id="ygrps-yiv-282301995">Bonjour :-)<br/>
<br/>
I have a vague memory of seeing a page or a conversation somewhere<br/>
with hints on organising park days. Does it ring a bell to anybody?<br/>
<br/>
I mean organising as in reaching out to other parents and start the motion...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to start a more active approach to helping my children make<br/>
friends in this new city. There are some homeschoolers around here but<br/>
they barely do anything as a group (and when they do it&#39;s very<br/>
schoolish stuff). I know of a place where we could go, either once a<br/>
week or every other week to meet with other children and play...<br/>
<br/>
Any experience or hints would be super nice.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
<br/>
Warmly<br/>
Claire</div>

I moderate a group called Home Learning Network Leaders where I help support people starting home learning groups, especially in places where finding other home learners is difficult. The leaders share their experiences and brainstorm ideas on how to help their groups grow. Currently everyone on the list lives in the Netherlands, but most of the correspondence is in English. You are welcome to join the group or take a peek at the archives of Leiden Home Learners - the home learning group that I run.<br/>

up some discussions and links. That&#39;s the name of the group Pam  <br/>
Sorooshian started with some others.<br/>
