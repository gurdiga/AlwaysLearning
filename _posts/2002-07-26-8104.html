<div id="ygrps-yiv-1796462460">&lt;My mother&#39;s neighbor said once, after I made the<br/>
comment that no one really knows for certain what<br/>
happens after death, &quot;Oh, I KNOW where I&#39;m going.&quot; (to<br/>
heaven). I remember thinking that she must not <br/>
TRULY believe that, or she&#39;d be content all the time.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
well, maybe not ALL the time.  Not when she&#39;s thinking<br/>
about how her son & daugter in law & grandchildren<br/>
will be going to that OTHER place because we don&#39;t<br/>
share her beliefs.<br/>
