<div id="ygrps-yiv-1375953644">We have started a new site for unschooling kids.  We thought it might be nice to have a place for unschooling kids to talk and chat and post to forums.  Also, because so many of the kids meet at conferences and things once or twice a year, it will be a nice place for them to keep in touch.<br/>
