=================================<br/>
<br/>
In school I have seen kids learn things my own unschooled kids don&#39;t  <br/>
need to do, and some of it they wouldn&#39;t know how to do if they needed  <br/>
to:<br/>
<br/>
to cheat on tests<br/>
to lie about whether a book was read; to bluff a book report<br/>
to figure out exactly how little work they can do and still pass<br/>
to change classes slowly enough that they can slip in the door just as  <br/>
the bell rings<br/>
to fake illness<br/>
to eat in class without being caught<br/>
to chew gum without being caught<br/>
to pass notes without being caught<br/>
to pretend to pay attention<br/>
to forge a parent&#39;s signature<br/>
to forge a teacher&#39;s signature<br/>
to lie to parents about what teachers said<br/>
to lie to teachers about what parents said<br/>
to convincingly make an F look like a B or an A, or a D into a B  (not  <br/>
used as much since report cards come off printers and aren&#39;t written  <br/>
by hand)<br/>
to make tattoos between the thumb and forefinger  with a straight pin  <br/>

<br/>
I was guessing Pam was gathering ideas for a talk next week.<br/>
My thought in making a parallel thread was to show those who might  <br/>
have been thinking of what school intends to teach that there&#39;s  <br/>
another level beyond that, of things that are ONLY &quot;naturally learned&quot;  <br/>
in school.  My kids have never had any reason to cheat.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t watch the news either.   It&#39;s not about me.<br/>
If someone is feeling strong emotions about memories of his own  <br/>
schooling, it might be better to touch on that a little, occasionally,  <br/>
and start to dump some of it each time so that thinking of school  <br/>
doesn&#39;t lead to outrage.   There are other emotions more along the  <br/>
understanding and regret and forgiveness side of the wheel that can  <br/>
remember the hurts of school in a more tolerable light.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I wish that we could be done with the school critique and return to  <br/>

<br/>
Start a new topic about wonderfulness.  No doubt this one was dying  <br/>
anyway.<br/>
<br/>
To change subjects from e-mail, start a fresh new e-mail, address it  <br/>
to the group, and put in a new subject line.  Otherwise it will show  <br/>
up under the old thread in the archives.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My 18 y.o., always-unschooled son, is in his second semester of  <br/>
community college.  Last fall was his first experience with school.   <br/>
He was amazed at the lack of interest the other students expressed at  <br/>
what he found fascinating, in this case, introduction to astronomy.   <br/>
He sat in the front row, took notes, asked lots of questions, got high  <br/>
grades on everything, and got picked on by another guy who called him  <br/>
&quot;teacher&#39;s pet&quot;!  That guy dropped out after the first test &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This semester, he&#39;s taking Japanese.  He noticed that, when the  <br/>
students have to write on the board, most of them write easy  <br/>
characters so they&#39;ll get them right.  He writes the ones he&#39;s having  <br/>
trouble with, usually the most complicated or ambiguous, so the  <br/>
teacher can correct them.  He finds the other students&#39; strategy  <br/>
nonsensical.  Yesterday, we went to Barnes and Noble so he could get a  <br/>
Japanese-English dictionary, which wasn&#39;t required for the class, and  <br/>
he also bought a grammar guide, because one of his classmates is  <br/>
having trouble with grammar.<br/>
<br/>
On the test, not on the test... doesn&#39;t matter to him -- he&#39;s learning  <br/>
because he wants to know.  (The interest in Japanese springs from  <br/>
Pokemon, video games, manga and anime :-)<br/>

I don&#39;t think school bashing is all that&#39;s going on.  There&#39;s more to<br/>
it for me.  It&#39;s helping me to deschool and understand exactly where I<br/>
want to go with unschooling in my own home.  *How* I want to share<br/>
information with Karl makes a huge difference.<br/>
<br/>
For instance: if it&#39;s not on the test it&#39;s not important knowledge.<br/>
That&#39;s good for an unschooler to mull over.  Do they really understand<br/>
the impact of *all* kinds of knowledge, not just how to read or use<br/>
numbers or *pick any subject area that schools traditionally have<br/>
picked*?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s meta knowledge to hear the pat unschooler response that all<br/>
knowledge is important.  It&#39;s specific knowledge thought to find other<br/>
hooks and connections to place with that thought.<br/>

It is really a list of what doesn&#39;t have to be &quot;taught,&quot; of course.  I <br/>
think it is very very useful to take some time to consider all that <br/>
stuff that most people think has to be taught is either learned <br/>
naturally by our unschooled kids or not learned because they never need it.<br/>

That book is interesting.  He history of american education book is  <br/>
sensationalist and myopic.  He&#39;s writing about New England but not  <br/>
about the whole U.S., which would be fine with me if he seemed to know  <br/>
it, or had specified that.   Other books I haven&#39;t looked at.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard him speak several times.  He&#39;s not an unschooler.  He&#39;s  <br/>
willing to make money off of unschoolers, and some unschoolers need to  <br/>
know there are teachers who can be well thought of by parents and  <br/>
administrators  and kids and still walk away.  But lots of unschooling  <br/>
parents were popular teachers who walked away.  I have a passle of  <br/>
thank-you letters from students and parents and an award I got when  <br/>
I&#39;d only been teaching six years.  But I&#39;m female and I&#39;m in New  <br/>
Mexico and I was interested in learning, not politics, and in  <br/>
unschooling, not in making money.  When I went in to quit my teaching  <br/>
job, they said no.  The principal had been my science teacher when I  <br/>
was 14 and it was his first year of teaching.  He offered me a  <br/>
sabbatical.   Unheard of, at my age and level of experience.  I  <br/>
declined.  He gave me a leave of absence, so that if I changed my mind  <br/>
in that year I still had my job.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard Gatto read speeches more than not, but I&#39;ve heard him just  <br/>
talk, too, but it wasn&#39;t powerful or dynamic.  It was just a guy who  <br/>
wasn&#39;t a homeschooling parent talking to a bunch of homeschoolers.    <br/>
Still, I think &quot;Dumbing Us Down&quot; can be useful.<br/>

I didn&#39;t know much about those things myself when I was a kid,  <br/>
though.  I appreciated those parts of school, and I like to see on  <br/>
Sesame Street or other kids&#39; shows when they go into shops or get  <br/>
factory tours.<br/>
<br/>
My dad was a welder, my mom stayed home, and I had no real idea what  <br/>
other people did.<br/>

Video games will do that!  Kirby was great with maps after he could  <br/>
use the Super Mario 3 player&#39;s guide.<br/>
<br/>
There are things about map reading that aren&#39;t like video games,  <br/>
though,  My kids have asked, and we often have a map or two up (and  <br/>
switch them out) so they&#39;ve seen lots of different kinds of maps, but  <br/>
it&#39;s because I consciously do that.   We have a couple of map-rich  <br/>
kids&#39; books, too, though, that I really liked to read with them when  <br/>
they were little.  Picture books.  One is called The Journey Home, and  <br/>
one is called My Place.  There might be better books now, but those  <br/>
were wonderful.<br/>

Having a parent who travels a lot for work does that, too. So  does traveling <br/>
a lot. Wyl (9) was interested in maps from a very young age  and we were both <br/>
happy for him to have a map in the back seat, looking at the  lines while I <br/>
drove, noticing the same numbers on the highways signs and on the  maps.<br/>
 <br/>
Since he learned to read, I print 2 copies of my directions  when I need to <br/>
use a mapping program and have him read in the back. That also  helps him <br/>
understand how to give people good directions, and how miles compare  to passage of <br/>
time. At first, he&#39;d read through the directions from start to  end, without <br/>
looking up, so he was done with trips in less than a minute. After  I <br/>
explained to him that if he waited until after I got done with the first line  of <br/>
instructions, then giving me the next (or two ahead), it was easier for me to  <br/>
remember and easier for me to follow. He&#39;s very good about remembering when I  <br/>
(not a number-memory person) need the highway number I&#39;m looking for on the  <br/>
signs. He&#39;s got a very good number memory, so I&#39;m very happy to have him  <br/>
&quot;co-pilot&quot; for me!<br/>
 <br/>
With the travel we&#39;ve done this year, Storm (4) is beginning  to get <br/>
interested in where things are (where&#39;s Tennessee?), so we bought a  *big* atlas of <br/>
North America last time we were at the store. My dad  and I loved pouring over <br/>
&quot;resource books&quot; when I was a kid: dictionaries,  encyclopedias, atlases... <br/>
Some of my most vivid (and satisfying) childhood  memories are of my dad and I <br/>
exploring that kind of stuff  together.<br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>
