<div id="ygrps-yiv-911117792">I just found a quote that discusses issues similar to problems that  <br/>
come up on lists such as this one sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
*************************************************<br/>
&quot;Church used to be that place where people could risk going and  <br/>
presenting their absolute worst self, once a week, and be heard by  <br/>
people who would accept you back, through communion, into the  <br/>
community. Once a week you would have this kind of talk therapy where  <br/>
you told your worst story and you were loved despite your worst self.  <br/>
So you never developed this alienation and isolation that split you  <br/>
so far from your community that you could just walk into a McDonald&#39;s  <br/>
and kill everyone.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Then church became that place where people went just to look good,  <br/>
and you didn&#39;t get that release of looking bad once a week. In a way,  <br/>
the support groups and 12 step groups and phone sex chat lines, all  <br/>
these contexts in which people present their worst selves and find a  <br/>
community despite their behavior, these have become the new Church.  <br/>
These are the new escape valves where people go and confess and are  <br/>
redeemed by their peers.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
**************************************************<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s talking Catholic church there, with weekly confession.  It  <br/>
hasn&#39;t worked that way for most Protestant churches for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes people want a group like this for a sense of belonging.   <br/>
That&#39;s okay, and sometimes not okay.    It&#39;s not the purpose of the  <br/>
list.<br/>
<br/>
(Oh.  The &quot;he&quot; of the quote above is Chuck Palahniuk, who wrote Fight  <br/>
Club and Choke.   He may be on to something that applies to  <br/>
unschooling discussion lists.)<br/>
