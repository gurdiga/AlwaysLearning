thought it spelled with an O rather than an A. Rhymes with hat would<br/>
be more literal, though. I wonder if there are regional variations<br/>

<br/>
OK so hubby from Denver is arguing with me over   &quot;what&quot;    - LOL    He says it does not rhyme and the way he says it, it does not.  I&#39;m from Southern Illinois and the way I say &quot;what&quot;  it does.  Southern Illinois has many words that are indigenous to that area it seems - like a blend of mid-west and southern.  Not just pronunciations but actual words.  The one hubby laughs about the most is &quot;tump&quot;  which means to tip and dump at the same time.  Instead of &quot;Ya all&quot; we say &quot;youens&quot;  Some of these words I cannot spell as we do not write that way but only speak that way. <br/>

*** If for some reason you were to need to rhyme &quot;twat,&quot; what <br/>
other words would you need? (Deb Lewis, I kinda hope you will do <br/>
your thing here***<br/>
<br/>
Just what is that thing I do with twats?  ....oh, wait....  <br/>
<br/>
I did write a little something about my seventh grade English <br/>
teacher, Ms. Bealafeld,  &quot;Bea as is bumble bee, &quot;la&quot; as in tra-la-<br/>
la,  feld.&quot;  (kind of a puny finish there, God, I hated her.)<br/>
<br/>
Her brain is very like a twat<br/>
What goes in slides right back out<br/>
Explaining will be all for naught<br/>
Because her brain is like a twat.<br/>
<br/>
I was thirteen and friend Judy had been shamed by Ms. Bealafeld for <br/>
being late.  &quot;Out&quot; does not rhyme with twat in my dialect then or <br/>
now but I thought I was very clever (I have many bad rhymes about <br/>
teachers from  those day).   I mostly liked that nice finish of <br/>
the &quot;T.&quot;   It worked for me, anyway and it worked for Judy, in the <br/>
moment. &lt;g&gt;   <br/>
<br/>
If I were writing about a twat today I&#39;d rhyme with snot or <br/>
distraught or dry rot or forgot. &lt;g&gt; <br/>

<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s different even now in different parts of Britain.<br/>
<br/>
Languages are alive.  I remember as a kid when they told me glass was  <br/>
a liquid, I believed it because we had a mirror at our house that had  <br/>
been built into the front of a close in 1910, probably, and the top  <br/>
wasn&#39;t very reflective at all, and the bottom was wavy like a  <br/>
funhouse mirror.<br/>
<br/>
International communications can cause more homogeneity in a language  <br/>
(just as tv and movies did, as radio did, as the printing press did)  <br/>
but it also gives us a way to see that the language can have a  <br/>
funhouse effect and that it really is liquid.<br/>

That sent me to Wikipedia, which made me wonder as it was loading, is  there <br/>
a dictionary-online or otherwise-with *world* meanings in it? Not so much  in <br/>
the homogenized way Sandra mentioned, but more in the  <br/>
listing-different-meanings kind of way that dictionaries do? That would be an  amazing <br/>
thing-something I&#39;d love to have in book form (though it would probably  be so large it <br/>
would have to be in encyclopedia-like &quot;set&quot; form) to finger  through, find <br/>
connections and cool discoveries by accident. Does such a thing  exist?<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think so, but you can go to google, click &quot;languages&quot; and  <br/>
choose a different nation&#39;s flag and google mostly sites from another  <br/>
English speaking country.<br/>
<br/>
If someone were to do such a book, I think it might end up being  <br/>
outdated by the time it was mailed out.<br/>
<br/>
This is the kind of thing people do masters&#39; theses and dissertations  <br/>
for PhDs on, though I&#39;m guessing most advisors would ask them to  <br/>
choose a different word.<br/>
<br/>
The cool thing about a &#39;bad word&#39; is that it&#39;s not already so  <br/>
documented, so the research of place and pronunciation could be more  <br/>
real.<br/>
<br/>
There is a U.K. map that will do accents, but I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll  <br/>
read any old word in the world.  I think there are just pre-recorded  <br/>
snippets of this and that, but it&#39;s possible that if one were to  <br/>
write to one of the builders of that he or she would just have an  <br/>
idea already.<br/>
<br/>
And in the case of a dissertation, the thing to be following and  <br/>
charting would be where the people&#39;s grandparents came from who said  <br/>
it what way.  Lots of that is hard to trace, even if it&#39;s all in the  <br/>
English speaking world.  Tracing someone back 200 years still doesn&#39;t  <br/>
show the effect of learning dirty words from the neighbor kids, etc.<br/>

In my American-southwest experience, it&#39;s twat-rhymes-with-rot and  <br/>
unspeakable name for female anatomy.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard that in the U.K. the most unspeakable (or un- <br/>
broadcastable) word of all is &quot;the c-word,&quot; cunt.<br/>
<br/>
Here, &quot;cunt&quot; is used as a horrible insult for a woman.  (Or as a very  <br/>
rude word for female anatomy, but not as rude as &quot;twat.&quot;)  A  <br/>
generation before me, they used &quot;douche bag&quot; or just &quot;bag&quot; as an  <br/>
insult for women.  &quot;Sorry sack&quot; I heard applied to a woman&#39;s face by  <br/>
someone who would be 80 or so if he were alive, and he grew up in  <br/>
Arizona and Utah.<br/>
<br/>
When we want to insult a male person, we don&#39;t use those female  <br/>
references.  We use &quot;dick&quot; or &quot;prick.&quot;  But that doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s a  <br/>
fool, it means he&#39;s thoughtlessly cruel or consciously mean.  Somehow  <br/>
he&#39;s harming other people.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering what we call &quot;fool.&quot;<br/>
Certainly not &quot;fool.&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Jerk, dork, idiot ?  Dumbass.  Not very bright.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1926278060">-=-My husbands family says &quot;srp&quot; instead of syrup. It drives me crazy  <br/>
and he complains that I say it wrong! -=-<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t be driven crazy by a pronunciation MILLIONS of people use.<br/>
Don&#39;t.<br/>
It&#39;s not good for you, and it&#39;s not good for your marriage or the  <br/>
peace of your house.<br/>
<br/>
Just accept that English is a lively language without an oversight  <br/>
committee, and don&#39;t worry about things like that.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I am from Seattle and he is from Montana and even being that close  <br/>
there is a huge difference in the way we say lots of words.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing (just guessing) that his family lived in Montana or  <br/>
points south for longer than your family was in Seattle.<br/>
It&#39;s not about &quot;close,&quot; it&#39;s about migration and culture.<br/>
<br/>
The SE corner of New Mexico is sometimes referred to as &quot;Little  <br/>
Texas.&quot;  The older folks speak as they do in West Texas.  Looking at  <br/>
a map, it&#39;s not surprising.  But those factors show up politically,  <br/>
too, on how they&#39;ll be expected to vote, what they&#39;re more likely to  <br/>
eat... It would be fun to talk to someone who does purchasing and  <br/>
inventory for a regional grocery store.  They probably send more  <br/>
grits and less masa to Roswell than to Silver City.  And they&#39;re both  <br/>
in southern New Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
This is me, writing years ago:<br/>
================================<br/>
One day when Kirby was a toddler, his dad said carefully and clearly,  <br/>
&quot;Kirby, close the cabinet.&quot; Kirby gazed back with no understanding.  <br/>
Keith tried again sweetly: &quot;Close the cabinet!&quot; Nothing. I saw the  <br/>
impasse, and said quickly, &quot;Kirby, shut the door.&quot; He lit up with  <br/>
recognition and SLAM, it was done.<br/>
<br/>
That day, I decided to try to use more than one word when I  <br/>
communicated with my kids. I knew that in England, after the Norman  <br/>
conquest, simple legal matters had been be stated in English and  <br/>
French both, and some of those phrases still exist, like &quot;will and  <br/>
testament,&quot; &quot;aid and abet,&quot; &quot;give and bequeath,&quot; and &quot;null and void.&quot;  <br/>
So for the sake of my children understanding both my child-of-Texans  <br/>
self AND my child-of-Bostonians husband (Boston and Michigan and  <br/>
Canada, but NOT Texas), I began to paraphrase. &quot;Kirby, can you hand  <br/>
me that blue cup? The plastic mug that&#39;s on the counter?&quot; Or &quot;Let&#39;s  <br/>
go to the park, okay? We&#39;ll walk down to the swings and picnic tables.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
===============================<br/>
<br/>
The rest of that is here:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/words">http://sandradodd.com/words</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My husband says &quot;neither&quot; with a long i sound on the first syllable.<br/>
<br/>
I say it with a long e sound.<br/>
<br/>
Our kids have used one or the other, and we&#39;ve never discussed it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My husband *always* calls Marty &quot;Martin.&quot;  I&#39;ve always called him  <br/>
&quot;Marty.&quot;  Everyone knows who we&#39;re talking to, even Marty!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My words and accent are an absolute function of being a migrant.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a Nebraskan by upbringing. When I travelled to California by train when <br/>
I was 18 and met people and lived there for a few months I let go of the pop <br/>
I&#39;d drunk for all of my 18 years to that point and took on their soda. <br/>
Living in the UK for the past almost 5 years I now say &quot;conserve-a-tree&quot; for <br/>
conservatory or sunroom as it was known in my house growing up. And Hospital <br/>
instead of the hospital or University instead of college or the university. <br/>
I don&#39;t say boot for trunk, but we have a van. I do say pants for underwear <br/>
and trousers for pants. I don&#39;t say tea for dinner and I don&#39;t call dessert <br/>
pudding. But I do call a yard a garden and that one was hard to change and <br/>
is hard to adapt when I travel back to the U.S.<br/>
<br/>
It is funny to watch these aspects of my dialect disappear as I integrate <br/>
more and more into the UK. I don&#39;t think I will ever sound British. And <br/>
neither Simon nor Linnaea really have British accents. But, that said, I <br/>
sometimes can&#39;t hear a British versus an American accent on television. <br/>
Although Hugh Laurie does the most amazing American accent for a Brit that I <br/>
think I&#39;ve ever heard. But I&#39;m listening for him to waver. He was good in <br/>
Stuart Little, but I think he&#39;s better in House, I&#39;ll have to watch Stuart <br/>
Little again and see.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, Sandra, as a complete sidenote, have you seen the Profanisaurus? <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.viz.co.uk/?%2Fprofanisaurus%2Fprofan_index.php%3Ffb%3D1">http://www.viz.co.uk/?%2Fprofanisaurus%2Fprofan_index.php%3Ffb%3D1</a> (if <br/>
that&#39;s too long: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/h6sb2)">http://tinyurl.com/h6sb2)</a>. There is a searchable index <br/>
there, but the book is really fun to wander through.<br/>

<br/>
I have a Brit friend who owns a house in Albuquerque.  The house  <br/>
itself is beautiful, but the back yard has a cinderblock wall, a  <br/>
large concrete patio slab, and otherwise hard dirt, rocks, weeds.<br/>
<br/>
He calls it &quot;the garden,&quot; which is an insult to green-growing gardens  <br/>
everywhere!! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
The first episode he said tomato SAUCE.  He got the &quot;tomato&quot; part  <br/>
right, but he didn&#39;t say &quot;toMAto sauce.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, I haven&#39;t heard a glitch.<br/>
<br/>
Kenneth Brannagh in &quot;Dead Again&quot; did a great job but for one line  <br/>
when he&#39;s out getting into the little sports car and said something  <br/>
with a British intonation.  Slight.<br/>
<br/>
Lately more and more English actresses are doing American parts.   <br/>
Harry Potter&#39;s aunt is in &quot;Catch and Release.&quot;  She does a good job.   <br/>
Imelda Staunton (hey!  Also now of Harry Potter...) did some American  <br/>
thing I saw in passing recently.<br/>
