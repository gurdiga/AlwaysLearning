<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have chronic fatigue issues, not pain - but the end result is  <br/>
similar, as far as being able to do things.<br/>
<br/>
First - as far as you are able, find ways to not have to do the daily  <br/>
things that will drain your energy. Groceries can be delivered.  <br/>
Houses do not need to be spotless. Cook in large quantities when you  <br/>
CAN cook, and freeze lots of meals. This will free up more time and  <br/>
energy for your son.<br/>
<br/>
We bought memberships to the local zoo and are looking into museums.  <br/>
That way, if I feel like I can get out but maybe only for an hour  <br/>
(not all day) we can still go someplace, and if we leave early I  <br/>
don&#39;t feel like the admission was wasted. We cut out ads from local  <br/>
stores and activities that look interesting, and taped them to a  <br/>
wall. Then if we have a free hour (or if I have an hour&#39;s worth of  <br/>
energy) we can just pick one and visit.<br/>
<br/>
My son is also the type to be disappointed if I hype something and  <br/>
then we can&#39;t go. I just stop hyping the events. When I get up, if I  <br/>
feel like we can go someplace, I will ask him what he wants to do  <br/>
(giving him a few options of things I feel up to).<br/>
<br/>
There may be a lot of things you can do at home, with some  <br/>
forethought as far as you own limitations. Can you help him cook? Do  <br/>
art projects? Put him in a bathtub with measuring cups and funnels  <br/>
and thermometers and ice? Pam Sorooshian had a recipe for a gelatin  <br/>
thingie that you can put paint in with an eyedropper - those are a  <br/>
LOT of fun! <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sandradodd.com/strew/tadaa.html">http://www.sandradodd.com/strew/tadaa.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Is there a teenager in the neighborhood who can take him to the park  <br/>
after school? Another homeschool family that can drive him to  <br/>
parkdays or classes? Would a motorized scooter help? They have those  <br/>
at a lot of places now, in the grocery stores and zoos and things.<br/>
<br/>
You might also ask HIM for ideas, what he&#39;d like to do at home. Kids  <br/>
can be amazingly creative.<br/>

Your words work well for two parent families where there are, well, two <br/>
parents. <br/>
<br/>
for us single moms on one income and only one adult, I think your advice <br/>
doesn&#39;t always work. <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t afford to hire a neighborhood kid.  One of my kids is in school, <br/>
an alternative school, but still a school where I hate a lot of what <br/>
happens there but it is the best solution for us at this time.  <br/>
Sometimes the ideal is not possible.  Sometimes you do what you can.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1876622768">Yes, I can understand that. Our credit cards supplement us right now with<br/>
what I pay for acupuncture as our insurance does not cover it either. I had<br/>
to do some deep soul searching with regards to creating debt and I am glad I<br/>
did. Still I realize this isn&#39;t always an option for people. I was just in<br/>
such a bad place of not being able to function and I couldn&#39;t deal with that<br/>
anymore. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Acupressure on the other hand is free. There are a number of sites on the<br/>
net and books (sometimes in a library) that give instruction on what you can<br/>
do at home. I use it at home often still. Also reflexology. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
There may be an acupuncturist in your area willing to use a sliding fee<br/>
scale as well. I am not sure where you are, but it is possible. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Have you looked into other modalities of pain management, like biofeedback<br/>
or EFT? I have talked with people who have had success at least getting<br/>
their pain to a manageable level using at home modalities.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I hope you get some relief. <br/>

I held dear and near is the Agreement (The Four Agreements) to *Always do<br/>
your best* ~ when I only had 15% energy to give, I was/am sure to give 100%<br/>
of my 15%. Some days it was more, some days it was less. I did the best I<br/>
could in the situation at hand. Not easy ~ absolutely worth every ounce of<br/>
effort, however!<br/>
Accepting the assistance of other families to do the big physical stuff with<br/>
the kids is important, when you can&#39;t do it. There are lots of fun sitting<br/>
down stuff you can make fun and exciting to balance it out. (covering the<br/>
kitchen table with art supplies comes to mind...)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-467947768">As a parent with one child in public school (alternative charter) and another unschooling, I say public school can be very expensive.  I guess my problem is that I still consider myself fully responsible for my child&#39;s education, even though she spends her day at school.  We still do everything that we would have done had she been at home and unschooling, plus I have to pay for before school child care (as I have to be at work before she does) and meals, both cost me about $200 a month, which is fairly cheap.  I don&#39;t qualify for anything cheaper, because I make some money.  And because I am at work, I often am paying a homeschooling family to pick up and drive my other daughter to events.  <br/>
<br/>
This is just as it is.  I&#39;m not complaining, I am happy with where my child is, in school, and I&#39;m happy with Alexx unschooling, and I think we are doing very well, considering.  As the girls get older, we&#39;ll do things a bit differently.  But I do think that it&#39;s hard for others, who have two parents in the house, to understand how those who have to do things a bit differently (single parents, a parent with a chronic illness, etc.).  We do the best we can.  <br/>

I have no idea what you already own and what your resources are.<br/>
If anyone thinks they might not be providing enough, maybe they  <br/>
should listen to that doubt.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone thinks unschooling means doing nothing with nothing, that&#39;s  <br/>
wrong.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re fine and doing well and you&#39;re confident, that&#39;s great!<br/>
If you&#39;re not, people on this list can help you get other ideas.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You could read here and figure out what you might want to consider  <br/>
providing if you don&#39;t already have it:<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.livingjoyfully.ca/">http://www.livingjoyfully.ca/</a><br/>
<br/>
All of those have links to other sites.  Joyce&#39;s has a link now to a  <br/>
list dealing with (in part) single-parent families, and other  <br/>
exceptional situations.  There might be ideas there, too.<br/>
<br/>
No one can give you a list of things you &quot;have to&quot; buy or do or see  <br/>
or hear, or tell you you&#39;re doing enough.  Unschooling is something  <br/>
you need to learn on your own (people here try to help all the time),  <br/>
and understand well enough to do it on your own in your own way.   <br/>
Asking us to tell you &quot;Yes you can be a good unschooling mom no  <br/>
matter what&quot; doesn&#39;t help with understanding it.  We&#39;re here to look  <br/>
at how to make it better, not to say &quot;good  enough--don&#39;t do any more  <br/>
than you&#39;re doing.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
==========================<br/>
As a person with chronic pain, it is possible to unschool.  Set up <br/>
win/win situations.  Be creative and interactive with your kids all <br/>
the way.  Warp the examples to what you can do - and still have the <br/>
principles there.  I created stacks of stuff in each place I would <br/>
likely have to spend the most time.  There were games, art stuff, <br/>
books, blankes light enough to make forts or ghosts or whatever, <br/>
I&#39;ve even played Star Wars while sitting.  It&#39;s all possible if you <br/>
keep the dialog going and the kids know where you are.  They will <br/>
flourish with the concentrated attention you give them.  Use your <br/>
energy efficiently.  I used to have piles set around so that when I <br/>
went toward one room I&#39;d have 6 or 7 things to take that direction.  <br/>
Eventually everything got done.  Ask for help when you need it and <br/>
keep on communicating with your support network.<br/>

<br/>

completely correlated to the idea of making a nest.  Unschooling in <br/>
less than ideal situations can work, if you work really hard at <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Very true!  As I got up this morning I was upset because we all slept <br/>
in really late.  We&#39;ve gotten on this really late schedule, which isn&#39;t <br/>
such a bad thing, but by the time we want to go and do things, it&#39;s <br/>
dark and things are closing.<br/>

So, the last few mornings, as I&#39;ve woken up really late, I said to <br/>
myself, &quot;focus on the beauty that the day yet holds, rather than on <br/>
what I may or may not have missed.&quot;.  It&#39;s really helped me stay in a <br/>
positive frame of mind, and thusly my kids feel that way too.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to get stuck into feeling like I&#39;ve wasted a day sleeping, <br/>
the idea of wasting time bothers me anyway.  I can choose to use it any <br/>
way I want, and I want to use it happily and productively, even if my <br/>
day starts late and ends late.  My kids feel my attitude and reflect in <br/>
accordingly.</div>

&gt; &gt; choice one often needs to remember to make repeatedly -- because the  <br/>
&gt; &gt; alternative gets in the way of moving toward something better. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Very true!  As I got up this morning I was upset because we all slept <br/>
&gt; in really late.  We&#39;ve gotten on this really late schedule, which isn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; such a bad thing, but by the time we want to go and do things, it&#39;s <br/>
&gt; dark and things are closing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, the last few mornings, as I&#39;ve woken up really late, I said to <br/>
&gt; myself, &quot;focus on the beauty that the day yet holds, rather than on <br/>
&gt; what I may or may not have missed.&quot;.  It&#39;s really helped me stay in a <br/>
&gt; positive frame of mind, and thusly my kids feel that way too.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t want to get stuck into feeling like I&#39;ve wasted a day sleeping, <br/>
&gt; the idea of wasting time bothers me anyway.  I can choose to use it any <br/>
&gt; way I want, and I want to use it happily and productively, even if my <br/>
&gt; day starts late and ends late.  My kids feel my attitude and reflect in <br/>
&gt; accordingly.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1481433081">I&#39;m working on my webpages, and found something two years old that I  <br/>
never put in public (though it started out in public, but y&#39;know...  <br/>
two years ago, and not on this list).  It&#39;s by Deb Lewis.  It&#39;s not a  <br/>
bang-on match for this topic, but there is an aspect that might be  <br/>
helpful.<br/>
<br/>
=====================================<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   ***Because im still not convinced.***<br/>
<br/>
What made you consider unschooling?   Why did you decide against school?<br/>
It&#39;s not our job to convince you of anything.  We offer ideas to people<br/>
who are interested in how unschooling works. But if you think there  <br/>
is something of value in this philosophy then it&#39;s up to you to do  <br/>
the research *you* require to be convinced either way. To either say,  <br/>
yes there&#39;s something here or no, it&#39;s not for me.  We can answer  <br/>
questions along the way.<br/>
<br/>
***Because some just watch TV. End. Then just play video games.<br/>
Period.  No tangents.  No inspired learning.  No pursuits, no follow up.<br/>
No questions. No discussions.  ***<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve asked you before and I think others have too, tell us what your kid<br/>
likes.<br/>
<br/>
Really, it helps some people to focus on the positive.  Because I really<br/>
get from your posts that you&#39;re very negative.  Maybe you&#39;re not in real<br/>
life, but the way these posts come through you&#39;re showing us a lot of<br/>
negativity about your kid.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mean to be harsh.  I think it&#39;s an important part of why you&#39;re<br/>
struggling with some of these unschooling concepts.  I can&#39;t remember<br/>
the<br/>
last nice thing you wrote about your child.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not always easy to stay positive when we&#39;re worried (especially<br/>
about our kids)  but we can&#39;t help you with the worry if you&#39;re stuck in<br/>
a moment you can&#39;t get out of.  (Plagiarism!&lt;g&gt;) (Thank you Bono)<br/>
<br/>
Please tell us what your kid likes to do, what does he consider to be<br/>
themost fun, what does he like to eat, what does he think about?   It  <br/>
will<br/>
help, I promise.<br/>
<br/>
I will bet you quantities of cash that there are untold connections in<br/>
your child&#39;s mind when he&#39;s watching his favorite shows and playing his<br/>
favorite games.   Just because an interest doesn&#39;t take off and take<br/>
tangible form doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not real.  Just because you&#39;re not<br/>
seeing a physical manifestation of his intellectual life doesn&#39;t mean  <br/>
there&#39;s<br/>
nothing going on.<br/>
<br/>
***And all the cool stuff your kids did only makes me feel that much<br/>
more frustrated.***<br/>
<br/>
Your son is nine?  I think we start comparing our kids to other kids<br/>
about this age, some before, but really about this age because they seem<br/>
so big in so many ways.  We&#39;re saying goodbye to our babies and we&#39;re<br/>
looking for our grown kids and missing this incredible person in<br/>
between.  And it can be, for the child, a difficult time when the  <br/>
most beloved<br/>
toys and games of childhood are losing their appeal and the very cool<br/>
stuff of the world of adults still seems too hard and too far away.<br/>
<br/>
What kinds of things do you do with him?  What do you talk about?  What<br/>
are some of *your* interests and how do they manifest themselves in your<br/>
family life?  What example do you set for your child?  Do you love life<br/>
or are you bored?  Do you love to learn or are you dispassionate?  When<br/>
you see a bug do you wonder what it is or do you squish it?   These are<br/>
all things to consider when we&#39;re wondering whether we&#39;re providing the<br/>
most interesting life possible for our kids.   It starts with us.<br/>
