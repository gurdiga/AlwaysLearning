<div id="ygrps-yiv-1584422780">Draven (11y/o) and Parker (my wife) were just playing a board game and when<br/>
Parker won Draven said &quot;I hate you.&quot;  This is a very hurtful phrase to<br/>
Parker and it&#39;s really the only thing we don&#39;t like him saying.  She said<br/>
(calmly) &quot;I don&#39;t like that&quot; and he says &quot;I don&#39;t care&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s typically how things play out once he says &quot;I hate you&quot; which can<br/>
happen at all different times.  When Parker and I first met (3+ years ago) I<br/>
had a habit of jokingly saying &quot;I hate you&quot; and she told me how much it<br/>
bothered her, and over time I worked on not saying it.    Draven saw me go<br/>
through that process and even helped to remind me not to use that phrase<br/>
when I forgot.  He knows the reasons it hurts Parker, he seems to understand<br/>
those reasons, but when he&#39;s upset he says it and once he says it he makes a<br/>
big deal out of meaning it and not caring that it hurts her.<br/>
<br/>
Another issue is the way he reacts when he loses.  He doesn&#39;t often play<br/>
games with us and when he does he&#39;s said he doesn&#39;t want us to let him win.<br/>
 However, when he loses he is devastated and gets very hurtful.  He also<br/>
does this when playing video games with people in person (but not so much<br/>
online).  He&#39;s sent friends home before because they beat him in a game.<br/>
 Most people don&#39;t want to play video games with him because they know it<br/>
will turn out badly, however it&#39;s Draven&#39;s favorite thing to do.<br/>
<br/>
I know there is another way to handle this, I&#39;m just not sure what it is<br/>
right now and I could use some other insight.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1813587193">My daughter Pearl was the same way.  She is only now, at 13, starting to be able to enjoy playing board games.  She is the kid who would make up ways for competitive games to not have winners and losers.  For example, she decided that in Battleship, it was good to get the holes in your boat filled up, because it repaired the boat and kept it from sinking. <br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t that Pearl was a &quot;bad sport,&quot; she just did not enjoy the competitive nature of most board games.  She felt bad for whoever lost.<br/>
<br/>
Once I figured that out, here are some of the things we did:<br/>
<br/>
We just didn&#39;t play board games, we did other stuff.  I&#39;d offer to play board games with my board game loving son when Pearl was asleep or otherwise occupied.  <br/>
<br/>
Invited her, but did not push her to play, ever.  I didn&#39;t want her to feel unwelcome to play, but I didn&#39;t want her to feel pressured to play.<br/>
<br/>
Thought of ways to make competitive games non-competitive.  It was creative and fun to do this. This worked with games beside board games too. <br/>
<br/>
For instance, we had a Pokemon birthday party once (Pearl and her brother Cas have birthdays that are four days apart, so they always had one big party together.)  Pearl always disliked party games at birthdays because there were usually winners and losers and prizes awarded. We came up with a list of games and figured out how to make them noncompetitive.  Instead of musical chairs, we had musical squares.  We laid out squares of fabric on the floor.  When the music stopped, you stood on a square; more than one kid could stand on the same square.  We took one square away for each turn, so by the end of the game the kids were all trying to stand on one fabric square.  It was funny and fun and getting everyone on to that one square was something all the kids worked on together to achieve.  We had an obstacle course.  We hid the goodie bags so every kid had to find theirs.  We did a ton of activities, not one of which involved competition.  The kids had a GREAT time and the moms were all saying how nice it was.<br/>
<br/>
Bought noncompetitive games.  Here&#39;s one good site: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.familypastimes.com/index.html">http://www.familypastimes.com/index.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Not keep score.  We still do this.  We play Apples to Apples until we feel we&#39;ve had enough.  We don&#39;t care who has the most cards at the end.  We play Whoonu but we don&#39;t add up our chips at the end.  Pearl and I play Scrabble or Boggle without keeping score. Lots of games can be played without keeping score.<br/>
<br/>
Some of our best family times together have been doing things that we made up or found out about while trying to come up with noncompetitive games and activities. &quot;Hide with the hider&quot; is one great example.  We play this on winter nights when it&#39;s dark.  One person hides somewhere in the dark house.  The searchers all have flashlights. When you find the person who is hiding, you hide with them, until the last person finds the whole group.  That game has become a family favorite. <br/>
 <br/>
What you want to avoid for sure is putting Dravin in situations where there&#39;s a good chance that he might lose.  And I would suggest not talking to him about being a good sport, telling him that not everyone can win every time etc. etc.  I&#39;m not accusing you of doing this; it&#39;s just that that is what I remember hearing when I was a kid, and I think it&#39;s still the conventional response today.  Kids already know they won&#39;t win all the time, but that doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t get bummed out when you lose.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1413695023">Simon and Linnaea don&#39;t play to win. Sometimes it makes Monopoly almost <br/>
impossible to play, but they give up their land to others or pay off someone <br/>
else&#39;s debt. When Simon was little he and I were outside playing Pokemon Master <br/>
Trainer board game and another little boy came over and asked if he could play. <br/>
Simon lost a role to capture one of the pokemon he wanted and when I said <br/>
something like &quot;well, that&#39;s the rules&quot; he got upset, tipped over the game and <br/>
stormed inside. The other little boy asked why I didn&#39;t just let Simon have the <br/>
pokemon. I couldn&#39;t come up with a reason. I stopped worrying about playing by <br/>
the rules that day. If it is just family, if it is a game with no one trying to <br/>
win, it is easy to make it about the fun of being together playing a game and <br/>
not so much about winning. Bananagrams is brilliant for that. I&#39;m really fast at <br/>
seeing words and figuring out ways to lay them out, Linnaea not so much. So I <br/>
help her as long as she wants me to. And she helps me if she sees something in <br/>
my letters.<br/>
<br/>
We also play a fair number of games that are fast to turn over, like Set or 5 <br/>
crowns or Blink. Games that you can play a series of and not have who won each <br/>
game be a particular point of interest, or even who got best 4 out of 7 or <br/>
whatever. Apples to Apples doesn&#39;t have to be about winning. Cluedo is kind of <br/>
fun to guess before you really know. Labyrinth is an easy one to be helpful <br/>
with. Blokus is good for that, too. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Winning isn&#39;t the reason I tend to play a game. Nor is following the rules. I&#39;m <br/>
doing it for the fun of it and the pleasure of hanging out with Simon or Linnaea <br/>
or David. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe next time, try and invite him to play a game that can have a less <br/>
competitive reinterpretation of the rules. And if that isn&#39;t really possible, <br/>
see if there is something else that can be done in the intervening moments. Some <br/>
folks need time to get to the point where they can handle losing well. Some <br/>
folks never get there. I can remember getting quite irritated at losing at <br/>
Scrabble to David on more than one occasion. What really helped me was seeing <br/>
why I was playing the game. I wouldn&#39;t discuss that with Draven, except in the <br/>
process of trying to figure out how to make a game more fun to play. <br/>

There might have been an extra layer of resentment because he was invited to play as a third of three, and ended up playing with a step parent (I&#39;m guessing), who beat him.  If he expressed resentment that was worded in a way he learned from you, the mom, I think you (and your partner) need to suck that up graciously.<br/>

were children, we played monopoly just like this.  We would loan each other <br/>

monopoly, and there were certainly no winners, but we sure had a lot of fun!<br/>

win every game if that is what they needed.  That I didn&#39;t have to teach her <br/>
some rules about not being able to win every time, or that life isn&#39;t fair, <br/>
or how to be a good loser.  I realised that I could do what I really wanted <br/>
to, and just let her enjoy the game the way it was fun for her.<br/>
<br/>
DH and I will often in a card game both be sitting on winning hands, and be <br/>
throwing away winning cards so that DD can win.  She still plays with an <br/>
open hand (she hasn&#39;t worked out how to hold the cards so we can&#39;t see yet), <br/>
so it&#39;s really easy to only challenge her if we know she can defend etc.<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t to say that she always has to win.  Sometimes, she makes it quite <br/>
explicitly clear that she wants DH or I to win, and will hold back her own <br/>
cards to achieve this.  Whichever way it works out, we all have fun, and <br/>
that is why we were playing in the first place.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1358073408">If I&#39;m playing a game with Mo (9), I&#39;ll ask if she wants hints, or I&#39;ll offer to play with a &quot;handicap&quot; so that she&#39;s likely to win. It doesn&#39;t feel like &quot;letting her win&quot; (to her) so she&#39;s okay with that. Sometimes, though, she&#39;ll flat out tell me she wants to win and I should let her. That&#39;s fine, too. <br/>
<br/>
When Ray was younger we&#39;d play Battleship by letting him see the opponents ships at the beginning of play as a way of creating a handicap. Of we&#39;d let him &quot;take back&quot; moves in strategy games. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-976137882">I appreciate all of the comments about the games.  There have been a lot of<br/>
things I haven&#39;t thought of, and once Parker is back home (she&#39;s away for a<br/>
week) we&#39;ll discuss a lot of it.<br/>

This was a major ah-ha moment for me.  I have a step parent who I&#39;m living<br/>
with again.  According to my mom we were extremely close when I was little<br/>
and I spent a long while calling him dad, however for as long as I can<br/>
remember I really haven&#39;t liked him and have always called him (even as an<br/>
adult) &quot;Mr. Lee&quot;.  I think I often forget that Parker is the step parent,<br/>
and that&#39;s both a hard role for her to be in, and a hard role for Draven to<br/>
deal with sometimes.  He calls her mom most of the time and he&#39;s never made<br/>
the &quot;you&#39;re not my parent&quot; type comments.  When Parker says something about<br/>
being the step mom, he says you&#39;re my mom, not my step mom.  However there<br/>
are probably times when he does feel like the step kid and like she&#39;s the<br/>
step mom, and that&#39;s a difficult place for him to be in.  Thanks for<br/>
pointing that out.<br/>

Another ah-ha moment.  I had already mentioned to her that I thought making<br/>
a big deal out of it was giving the words more power and she agreed, but I<br/>
think reacting this way is even better.  I&#39;m worried that &quot;I love you&quot; would<br/>
be responded to negatively in that moment, but &quot;I&#39;m sorry your frustrated&quot;<br/>
or some version of that would probably work well.<br/>

Thanks a ton everyone!<br/>
