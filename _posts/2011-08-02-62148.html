<div id="ygrps-yiv-350568792">I am an only child, and I&#39;d have to say, that it sounds absolutely<br/>
wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
Plenty of time to go indepth with lots of stuff.  And as an only child I<br/>
found that I had cycles where I&#39;d like to be &quot;social&quot; and other times when I<br/>
was perfectly content to stay at home for days on end.  Oh, wait, that is<br/>
still me now!<br/>
