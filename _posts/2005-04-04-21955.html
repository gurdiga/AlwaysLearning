<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;try it out. I didn&#39;t want him to go back and forth in his mind.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is something that we have worked with for the first time this year. My<br/>
15 yo freshman son started public school for the first time last year in the<br/>
8th grade. That was a very fun year for him and all went well. No struggles,<br/>
self-motivated, got himself up and went happily each morning. This year,<br/>
about two months in, he said he wanted to unenroll. He said he had things he<br/>
wanted to do. The school said he could return in January if he wanted. So he<br/>
unenrolled, mostly hung out at home, worked on the inground skate bowl that<br/>
he&#39;s building in the backyard, then went back in January. He had no trouble<br/>
&quot;catching up&quot; and is now again saying he doesn&#39;t want to go, nothing is<br/>
meaningful, it&#39;s all crap, BUT he wants to stick it out to finish, because<br/>
that makes sense to him (maybe for his future plans?? I&#39;m not really sure<br/>
why, but supporting him nonetheless).<br/>
<br/>
I think it FEELS like allowing a child who has chosen to school to stay home<br/>
whenever he felt like it COULD promote some kind of irresponsible behavior<br/>
pattern, but I think that is just a feeling, not necessarily reality. It<br/>
probably would reek havoc with his experience in school when he did go. My<br/>
16 yo (different child) is unschooling and taking classes at the art high<br/>
school. He doesn&#39;t want to go half the time. The problem with that is when<br/>
others are depending on him, like the drama group he is in. I remind him of<br/>
these things, but still let him make the decisions that he then has to live<br/>
with. He seems to be learning how it works, and what happens when people are<br/>
disappointed because he didn&#39;t &quot;do his part&quot;. I think he is also learning<br/>
what he is and isn&#39;t really interested in.<br/>
<br/>
These experiences may feel and look messy because they don&#39;t follow the<br/>
system&#39;s schedule, but isn&#39;t that how our thinking and learning really<br/>
happen? Individually? All over the place? In different ways at different<br/>
times? The public school system is a one-size-fits-all program that, if<br/>
followed to a T, numbs children to their own passions. It is hard to be in<br/>
that system for any period of time and stay true to one&#39;s own needs and<br/>
desires. It makes complete sense to me that some days a child feels like<br/>
going, and some days they don&#39;t. And maybe even a few months on and a few<br/>
months off. It&#39;s not the way a teacher or administrator would like it to<br/>
happen, and that is probably what makes some of us think that if our child<br/>
chose to go to school, he needs to stick it out for the year. But that<br/>
teacher and that administrator does NOT have our individual children&#39;s needs<br/>
in mind. That&#39;s our job. And it takes real courage sometimes to support our<br/>
children&#39;s desires.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2128774907">Jacki, thank you for your insights.  It really helped me understand and put<br/>
it all (that fear of not carrying something through) into perspective.<br/>
After I read your e mail I had to delete my other responses because you were<br/>
already one step ahead of my reasoning.  And then I read Sandra&#39;s article<br/>
&quot;Public School on Your Own Terms&quot; and I am going back and forth.  I feel<br/>
better, though:  doubly reminded that it&#39;s not about me.  :-)  (  doubly?<br/>
