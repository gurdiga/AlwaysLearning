<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Publishers prefer to choose the artist. From what I&#39;ve heard, they&#39;ve had<br/>
bad experience with writers and artists who team up and then disagree. So<br/>
they prefer to be the go between.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Publishers won&#39;t stay in business by stealing people&#39;s work! And there&#39;s too<br/>
much out there that they don&#39;t have to steal.<br/>
<br/>
But you should know about contracts. Your library should have a copy of<br/>
Writer&#39;s Market Guide. That covers everything a writer needs, including<br/>
where.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also self or vanity publishing, where you pay for printing yourself<br/>
and then distribute on your own, which used to be expensive but has come way<br/>
down in price I&#39;ve heard.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t bother looking for an artist. Publishers will publish work by an <br/>
author/illustrator, but they prefer to find their own illustrators <br/>
otherwise. They often pair a new author with a well-known illustrator. <br/>
Everything I&#39;ve read says there is no danger of reputable publishers <br/>
stealing your work, so you don&#39;t need to worry about that. Your work is <br/>
copyright as soon as you write it down. Also, I&#39;ve read that it&#39;s not a <br/>
good idea to mention series when approaching a publisher. They usually just <br/>
want to look at a book on its own merits. Once they accept it is the time <br/>
to mention further books.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1029113904">Hi, Nanci.  My Dad&#39;s an author, and he always used those *Writer&#39;s Market* books that you can find in the reference section of the library.  There are some specialized ones, like *Poet&#39;s Market*, so maybe there&#39;s one for children&#39;s books.  If not, there&#39;s probably a section in *Writer&#39;s Market* about it.  Good luck!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s referred to fondly as CWIM, the Children&#39;s Writer&#39;s and Illustrator&#39;s <br/>
Market. The 2004 version should be coming out really soon if it isn&#39;t <br/>
already out. They&#39;re also considering going to an online subscription like <br/>
Writer&#39;s Market has. You sign up for a year or a month at a time. I think <br/>
it&#39;s about $30/year or $3/month for Writer&#39;s Market. They update it <br/>
frequently, making it more useful than the print pub, and you can search it <br/>
in various ways, saving your searches. I think you can even track your <br/>
manuscript submissions with it. I&#39;m considering getting the Writer&#39;s Market <br/>
that way next year, and I&#39;ll definitely do CWIM online if they decide to do <br/>
that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-790294310">If you are going to try to go through a typical publisher, they prefer you don&#39;t have the stories already illustrated.  They have their own artists they work with.  If you want to try to self publish, then you will want to find someone to illustrate them.  There are many good books out there on getting children&#39;s books published.  Look at the library.<br/>
