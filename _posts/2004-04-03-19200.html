<div id="ygrps-yiv-1426245517">WOW! That is a lot but she been out in the world since &#39;96. Not quite<br/>
like this. LOL! I&#39;m sure she&#39;s happy with it or she wouldn&#39;t be where she<br/>
is. From the glimpses that you gave she knew her own mind and went with her<br/>
heart. I wish her the best and brightest.:-)<br/>
<br/>
    Scary I know! We have been school free since &#39;96 too. My oldest,<br/>
Michael, is 18. He started Community College in Sept &#39;03 fulltime. Got his<br/>
drivers license in Jan &#39;04. He took a seasonal job for Christmas and<br/>
Valentines day. Now he&#39;s taking a break from school and enjoying his<br/>
friends. Most of them are Seniors this year. He is currently battling<br/>
depression and the road has been hard for him but I think it&#39;s getting<br/>
better. I&#39;m so thankful we found this lifestyle. This would have been a<br/>
total nightmare if we hadn&#39;t. He keep thing to himself enough as it is.<br/>
Luckily he does talk to me. His Dad&#39;s another story. Well that&#39;s quite<br/>
enough from me. Glad to see you here. :-)<br/>

&gt; Hey Barb!!  Another familiar face here!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yup, Kat&#39;s life has changed so drastically in the last year.  She got her<br/>
&gt; license Jan of 2003, first job April 2003, engaged in May 2003, moved out<br/>
&gt; and in with her fiance July 2003, and then tied the knot at a civil<br/>
&gt; ceremony two weeks ago.  &lt;sigh&gt;  She was ready, but her dad and I were<br/>
&gt; not.  What is it with these kids?  You raise them to think for themselves,<br/>
&gt; make their own decisions, and then they really go out into the world and do<br/>
&gt; just that!!!  Scary!!   LOL!<br/>
