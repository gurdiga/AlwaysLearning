Reality check - unschooling teens do often meet each other on the internet - <br/>
often introduced to each other (on the internet) by other unschooling teens. <br/>
Sometimes they meet - if they go to Not-Back-to-School-Camp or another <br/>
unschoolish get-together. LOTS of them travel around and stop and stay at <br/>
homes of people they met on the internet. We have had a batch of them coming <br/>
and going from here over the past few weeks - there was a big New Years <br/>
get-together in Santa Barbara (a couple of hours north of us) and many of <br/>
them ended up coming down here, too. A few of them we&#39;d met at the <br/>
Sacramento, California conference last year or my daughter met at NBTSC. But <br/>
at least a couple of the boys were internet-only friends.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think that hiding your  name and fearing people on the internet has to do <br/>
with chatrooms where people are trolling for cybersex, or spinning yarns <br/>
about the size of their penis whether they have one or not (although <br/>
undoubtedly it&#39;s mostly men lying about who they are, not women, because <br/>
women frequently have better things to do, online or off, than lie about <br/>
their real or fantasy sex life). <br/>
<br/>
I have invited people home I met in real life.  Often. But where did I meet <br/>
them?<br/>
<br/>
In a class, at a music session, at La Leche League, at a homeschooling <br/>
conference (when we used to have them; I wish we still did), at another <br/>
friend&#39;s house.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t go to bars to find new friends.  I don&#39;t cruise alleys to find new <br/>
friends.  <br/>
<br/>
So some people (lots of people&#39;s grandmothers who read Time magazine and <br/>
watch daytime talk shows but have never seen a piece of e-mail) are sure that <br/>
the internet is an international bar and alley.<br/>
<br/>
And for some people it is. Some people do NOTHING with their internet access <br/>
as far as I can tell but go into chatrooms.  So for them, it&#39;s writing <br/>
practice.  And they probably should not be encouraged to go to a bus station <br/>
to lend one of those other people $100, it&#39;s true.  Same as you shouldn&#39;t <br/>
walk a drunk guy from the bar to his busstop (or anywhere) unless you can <br/>
take him down and you have pepper spray and a cell phone.<br/>
<br/>
That has absolutely nothing to do with people whose online activity is the <br/>
equivalent of La Leche League meetings and homeschooling conventions.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I should say that my boys have screennames that aren&#39;t their own names.  <br/>
Kirby started off as &quot;KirbyDodd&quot; but now he&#39;s &quot;ZoloHexx&quot; and <br/>
&quot;Skyrider&quot;-something--characters in online games.  Marty has three <br/>
screennames.  On he&#39;s just made for a &quot;wild west&quot; game.  I helped him make a <br/>
list of first and last names that might be cool, and he picked &quot;Dirk <br/>
Trimble.&quot;  Trimble is my granny&#39;s maiden name, so I know for sure there were <br/>
Trimbles in Oklahoma and Texas in the 19th century.  And we talked about the <br/>
artsiness of having a one syllable name with a two-syllable, or vice versa.  <br/>
So &quot;Dirk&quot; has that hard &quot;k&quot; that suggests toughness and danger, and &quot;Trimble&quot; <br/>
makes a pun with &quot;tremble,&quot; and...  That&#39;s a fair amount of learning for the <br/>
creation of a gaming persona and a screenname.<br/>
<br/>
I just asked the only awake teen (of four) in the house about those games.  I <br/>
asked if the guys were really hiding their identities.  He said no, they just <br/>
had screennames they liked, but if anyone asked who they were they&#39;d tell <br/>
them, their first names, anyway.<br/>
