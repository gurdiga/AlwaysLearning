<div id="ygrps-yiv-1323664708">I was trying to read Danielle Conger&#39;s spirited child page which I *think* I got from here originally, and I know is linked to on Sandra&#39;s site, but her organic learning site doesn&#39;t seem to be there anymore. Does anyone know if it&#39;s moved somewhere else?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>

I need to remove links from my site, because Danielle took her &quot;Connections&quot; site down last year.<br/>
<br/>
She warned me in time that I could rescue some things that otherwise might have disappeared.  Some of those I saved are linked from these pages:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/benlovejoy">http://sandradodd.com/benlovejoy</a><br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/robyncoburn">http://sandradodd.com/robyncoburn</a><br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/deblewis">http://sandradodd.com/deblewis</a><br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/renallen">http://sandradodd.com/renallen</a><br/>
<br/>
Danielle still has her blog, though she hasn&#39;t posted lately, and I have links to some of her things here.  I think the links will work if they don&#39;t go to Connections.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/danielleconger">http://sandradodd.com/danielleconger</a><br/>
<br/>
And if someone&#39;s ever looking for a URL and you still have the URL, you can google wayback machine, and it will take you to the internet archives, where you might be able to look at older images collected of the page at some point in the past.  Not all pages are there, but some are.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
If people know of other rescued articles I failed to link above, please leave a comment!  <br/>
And for those who don&#39;t like my writing as much as you like other people&#39;s, the links above all have links at the bottom to six to a dozen other people&#39;s writing.<br/>
