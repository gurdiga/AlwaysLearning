<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I could choose a project a week (of course only if they girls are <br/>
&gt; interested) and a field trip a month to offer to the kids.  That would be a <br/>
&gt; plan :-) ahhhh   a plan!  And somewhere in there I should fit a movie, I <br/>
&gt; think. ?????<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know this sounds stupid to people that this stuff flows for but this is <br/>
&gt; me.  I need a plan.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is this still unschooling?  When would I be crossing the line?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How about a plan that says the girls and I will choose a movie a week, a book <br/>
to be reading aloud all the time, some kind of project to be working on, and <br/>
someplace to go.<br/>
<br/>
So - this is how I imagine this happening: <br/>
<br/>
Pat: &quot;Hey, girls, wanna get a movie?&quot;<br/>
Girls: &quot;What movie?&quot;<br/>
Pat: &quot;I&#39;ve heard that xyz movie is good, wanna try that one?&quot;<br/>
Girls: &quot;No - we want to watch The Little Mermaid.&quot;<br/>
Pat: &quot;Well - we&#39;ve seen that one 48 times, maybe we could try a new one?&quot;<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-637334846">Aaaaaargh - that sent right in the middle of me writing it -- <br/>
<br/>
I have a new keyboard and there is SOME keyboard combination that I&#39;m <br/>
accidentally hitting that is just sending - and I type really fast and can&#39;t <br/>
figure out what it is.....<br/>
<br/>
anyway - I left you in the middle of Pat and her girls discussing a movie &lt;G&gt;<br/>
.<br/>
<br/>
Pat: &quot;We&#39;ve seen The Little Mermaid&quot; 48 times already.&quot;<br/>
Girls: &quot;Yeah - we want to see it AGAAAAAIN!!!!!&quot;<br/>
Pat: &quot;Okay - let&#39;s get that and something else that I pick.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So - you get a movie YOU want to watch with them. First you watch their <br/>
choice and then later you put yours on. You don&#39;t make them watch it. You <br/>
invite them. If they don&#39;t take you up on it YOU watch it anyway and enjoy it <br/>
yourself. There will be a million chances for them to watch a movie. THIS is <br/>
a chance for them to exercise some decisionmaking - and to make their own <br/>
choices. That is just as important (more) than any movie they could watch and <br/>
you&#39;d destroy that by insisting they watch it.<br/>
<br/>
I think you might want to focus more on some more subtle types of learning <br/>
than the obvious &quot;information&quot; type of learning, Pat.<br/>
<br/>
Think about underlying &quot;lessons&quot; being picked up. <br/>
<br/>
If YOU come up with the plans for what they should learn - even if you do it <br/>
nicely - you are teaching them that they need someone else to plan their <br/>
lives for them. But what you want (I think) is for them to develop the <br/>
knowledge that they are responsible for their own life and learning. Examine <br/>
everything you do with the question in mind: &quot;Does this undermine or support <br/>
my really important objectives?&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I like this a lot.  This way I can plan - I like planning.  I&#39;m not inflexible at all with my plans but they help me have a sense of purpose which is a must.<br/>
<br/>
I actually feel depressed if I don&#39;t have a sense of purpose in my life.  Unfortunately, because of the way I was raised, purpose only comes from doing not being.  I have not laid that one on my kids, thank goodness, but I don&#39;t think I will ever be able to change myself.  <br/>
