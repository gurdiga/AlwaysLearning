<div id="ygrps-yiv-1593615104">From a Time magazine article on J.K. Rowling, referencing Harry Potter:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;He is also a billion-dollar media property and a global cultural  <br/>
figure. Now translated into 65 languages, the books have joined a  <br/>
canon that stretches from Cinderella to Star Wars, giving people a  <br/>
way to discuss culture and commerce, politics and values. Princeton  <br/>
English professor William Gleason compares the series&#39; impact to the  <br/>
frenzy that surrounded Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin before the Civil War. &#39;That  <br/>
book penetrated all levels of society,&#39; he says. &#39;It&#39;s remarkable how  <br/>
similar the two moments are.&#39; And he does not see this as a passing  <br/>
fad or some triumph of clever marketing. &#39;They&#39;ve spoken profoundly  <br/>
to enough readers that they will be read and reread by children and  <br/>
by adults for a long time,&#39; he says. Feminist scholars write papers  <br/>
on Hermione&#39;s road to self-determination. Law professors cite Dobby&#39;s  <br/>
tale to teach contract law and civil rights. University of Tennessee  <br/>
law professor Benjamin Barton published &#39;Harry Potter and the Half- <br/>
Crazed Bureaucracy,&#39; in the Michigan Law Review, which examined  <br/>
Rowling&#39;s view of the legitimacy of government. His conclusion?  <br/>
&#39;Rowling may do more for libertarianism than anyone since John Stuart  <br/>
Mill.&#39; A Rutgers researcher named a rare rain-forest plant in Ecuador  <br/>
apparata after her verb apparate because it seemed to appear out of  <br/>
nowhere. French intellectuals debate whether the stories indoctrinate  <br/>
kids into free-market capitalism. In Turkey, the books were absorbed  <br/>
into the argument over Turkey&#39;s cultural geography: Is Harry a symbol  <br/>
of Western imperialism or of lost Eastern traditions of mysticism and  <br/>
alchemy? A seventh-grade teacher in Pakistan in November invited her  <br/>
class to compare the country&#39;s crisis to Harry Potter. The class  <br/>
immediately cast Pervez Musharraf as Voldemort and Benazir Bhutto as  <br/>
Bellatrix. &#39;Potter is like a Rorschach blot,&#39; says Georgetown  <br/>
government professor Daniel Nexon, &#39;for people articulating concerns  <br/>
about globalization in their cultural setting. It&#39;s incredibly  <br/>
significant that Potter even enters these debates.&#39; &quot;<br/>

The idea of connections isn&#39;t off topic, but the many connections to  <br/>
any specific thing goes off topic pretty quickly, so I&#39;m reminded to  <br/>
link a blog I&#39;ve started just for the purpose of helping people  <br/>
explore connections for fun.  This week we&#39;re doing wood.  If it  <br/>
looks like unit studies, it&#39;s not that--it&#39;s seeing wood as a portal  <br/>
to the universe, as something that connects to everything, and  <br/>
appreciating what some people know about wood and what they can do  <br/>
with it.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://thinkingsticks.blogspot.com">http://thinkingsticks.blogspot.com</a><br/>

If you&#39;ve felt unsure about the idea of strewing or immersion in a  <br/>
topic, or if you just enjoy the strewing and immersion feeling, come  <br/>
by there.  As weeks go by there will be more topics you could add to  <br/>
or explore.<br/>
