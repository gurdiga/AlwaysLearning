<div id="ygrps-yiv-1595497341">The only post I saw about the boards, was from Pam saying they were<br/>
working on it.<br/>
When I checked it the next day, it was back. I just looked through all<br/>
the lists and didn&#39;t see where it was ever announced by anyone. So I<br/>
think they just expected us to check it? I dunno...but none of the<br/>
lists got an announcement that I can see, so it wasn&#39;t just you in the<br/>
dark.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-754014215">I didn&#39;t know - sorry. I&#39;ve been preoccupied with Roya getting her  <br/>
wisdom teeth out, Rosie&#39;s birthday weekend, and other things.<br/>
<br/>
I think we have to register again, by the way, in order to be able to  <br/>
post. And resubscribe if you want email notifications of posts.<br/>
<br/>
THANK YOU JON!!! (Rue&#39;s husband is the one who made it all work again!)<br/>
