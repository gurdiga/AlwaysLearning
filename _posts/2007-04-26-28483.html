Hi.  I&#39;m Wende, unschooling my two great kids Ben (5, almost 6) and<br/>
Aliza who is 4.  I read several of John Holt&#39;s books while I was<br/>
pregnant with Ben, and we decided this would be the way to go for us<br/>
from the start.  I&#39;m by far the &quot;primary&quot; parent, but my husband John<br/>
(who travels a lot) is a super &quot;outide the box&quot; guy who keeps things<br/>
fresh and exciting.  We live in coastal SC.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve joined the group for some support and inspiration.  I belong to<br/>
an active homeschooling community, but most of the members are &quot;school<br/>
at home&quot; families.  I respect and am grateful for my local group but<br/>
sometimes have questions, musings and quandaries very specific to our<br/>
unschooling lifestyle.  I&#39;m pleased to have found myself here!<br/>

Not only is the conference in Asheville, NC this September (600-700 or <br/>
more unschoolers in one place!), but there&#39;s an unschooling group <br/>
somewhere near you.<br/>
<br/>
We have School&#39;s Out Support (statewide) and ChazUnschoolers---and the <br/>
NCUnschoolers are very active if you&#39;re closer to the NC line.<br/>
<br/>
Googling &quot;Unschooling/ers&quot; and &quot;your state&quot;  (for example: unschooling <br/>
MT or unschoolers ID) should always get you a dozen or so hits.<br/>
<br/>
Also---if there is NOT a group near you, start one! Post on the local <br/>
inclusive lists (and others) that you are on and say that you are <br/>
looking for other unschoolers. Make an e-group: <br/>
CoastalUnschoolers@yahoo.... or something like that. They come out of <br/>
the woodwork---they really do! It&#39;s just that everyone is waiting for <br/>
someone *else* to do the work. BE that someone else!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll email you off list about state-specific stuff and to hook you up <br/>
with SOS, but to meet unschoolers in your area, you need to be <br/>
proactive!<br/>
