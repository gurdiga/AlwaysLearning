way...some of our best and most interesting conversations swirl around<br/>
religions and the history therein. Everything is connected.<br/>

It seems, too, that if someone who actually has been involved heavily  <br/>
in religion and then leaves says something, from her own experience,  <br/>
someone else who knows little to nothing about it will defend the  <br/>
religion just on some general principle.  Trying to keep all things  <br/>
equal might &quot;seem fair,&quot; but all things are NOT equal, in any given  <br/>
context.<br/>
<br/>
This might bring us back to the seasonal discussion of what it means  <br/>
to &quot;respect everything equally,&quot; a claim that some people proudly  <br/>
make.  &quot;I respect all religions&quot; or &quot;I respect all opinions.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Since the subject line is &quot;respect for kids,&quot; the idea and ideal of  <br/>
respect might be an appropriate one.<br/>
<br/>
There is such a thing as disrespecting an entire class of people or  <br/>
segment of society, and there are most definitely people who consider  <br/>
children&#39;s opinions of little consequence.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, this is what has been on my mind lately.  The normalization of <br/>
disrespect for children.  The catch phrases and patter of <br/>
conventional <br/>
parenting discussions are wrought with the idea that its our turn to <br/>
be in the driver&#39;s seat.  What we say goes.  Our needs must be met <br/>
first in order for happines to prevail in the household.  If one <br/>
does <br/>
not go by this creed, then that parent is seen as permissive, loose, <br/>
and their child doomed to failure.  It&#39;s parenting as competitive <br/>
sport.  <br/>
<br/>
Even in our homeschool group this dynamic can get played out from <br/>
time <br/>
to time.  Oftentimes other moms are looking for support about how <br/>
to &quot;get more out of their kids.&quot;  Not to help the kids, but to show <br/>
themselves and/or spouses and family that they have done the right <br/>
thing by letting them be home. It&#39;s all about the performance. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-308522130">I&#39;ve certainly found that too, Ren, at least from my *open minded* friends. <br/>
I can even tolerate the conversations that turn into the proselythizing or<br/>
bashing because I like a good debate.  I don&#39;t mind standing up, standing<br/>
out, and standing against for what I believe is the Religious Right<br/>
overtaking what my beliefs are all about.  I also like discussing how so<br/>
many different beliefs tie together.  We don&#39;t have to agree on everything<br/>
but it&#39;s nice to talk and maybe see someone else&#39;s POV on a matter... maybe<br/>
their right, maybe their wrong... but it doesn&#39;t hurt to have an open<br/>
discussion on issues.<br/>
