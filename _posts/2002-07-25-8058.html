<div id="ygrps-yiv-1482109076">Last Thursday we went to a place called Crystal Park.  It&#39;s over by the<br/>
Big Hole Battlefield National Monument  near a little, town called Wise<br/>
River.  (oh, oh, Why did Wise River stop crowning a Queen during<br/>
Battlefield Days???  Nobody wanted to be MISS BIG HOLE!    &lt;snort&gt; ) <br/>
Crystal Park is National Forest Service land and there&#39;s water,<br/>
picnicking, potty&#39;s, etc, all the conveniences of home.  <br/>
At this amazing place you can turn over a shovel full of sandy dirt and<br/>
find crystals and minerals of all kinds.  Quartz and smokey quartz,<br/>
amethyst, sapphire, it&#39;s wonderful.<br/>
We took my friend Linda and her visiting nephew, Lane, who is a very<br/>
smart and studious and quiet boy, but if fun that day could be measured<br/>
by layers of dirt, he had more than any of us.  <br/>
Dylan took his rock pick, but the digging was so easy he didn&#39;t need it<br/>
much, and the boys found bags full of crystals.  <br/>
The terrain is surreal.  People have been digging there for years and<br/>
it&#39;s not an open, barren pit but some steep and some flat land, and<br/>
forested.   As you walk around there are pits and holes and mounds of<br/>
dirt.  If you threw in a naked woman or a melting wristwatch it could be<br/>
a Dali painting. (or a crime scene!)  Truly weird. There are chipmunks<br/>
every where and by golly you&#39;d better have something for them because<br/>
they just charge right up to you and demand food, like little, fat<br/>
highway men.  <br/>
The kids climbed around in pits and on boulders and Dylan identified<br/>
rocks and they dug and dug and played and picked wild flowers for us.  It<br/>
thundered and threatened to storm the whole time we were there but it<br/>
didn&#39;t rain.  We spent hours digging, sifting dirt, washing crystals and<br/>
playing.  <br/>
Then last Friday and Saturday was Art in the Park, in Anaconda, where<br/>
talented folks get together to sell their wares.  There&#39;s food and music<br/>
and dancing, but most importantly, pottery.&lt;g&gt;   The boys liked the food<br/>
and dancing part the most. Who&#39;d have thought a nine and ten year old<br/>
could eat and dance so much?   I laughed so hard my stomach hurt for<br/>
days.<br/>
This week has been quiet and slow.  Lane went home to eastern Montana,<br/>
we&#39;re dog sitting for our neighbors and Dylan is studying like mad for<br/>
his purple belt test.  I had to move the kicking bag outside it rattled<br/>
the house so much.  <br/>
We&#39;re watching a baby Yellow Warbler in our apple tree as he tries to<br/>
fly.  We&#39;ve been worrying over him through hail storms and high winds and<br/>
Gunther, the cat from down the street,  but there he sits this morning,<br/>
ready to try again. <br/>
We finally identified our mystery stink bug, Perillus bioculatus, for<br/>
those who care. &lt;g&gt;   But still researching a new jumping spider.  And we<br/>
have big plans for the Drive-in Saturday night.<br/>
