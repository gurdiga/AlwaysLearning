<div id="ygrps-yiv-78256445">***we got rid of junk food restrictions about 2 weeks ago (still<br/>
in the adjustment phase and hoping to survive.***<br/>
<br/>
One thing I did and still do is make sure there is other food ready all<br/>
the time.  Little kids don&#39;t like to wait for food,  and even at ten,<br/>
when he knows how to make so many things, my son still sometimes prefers<br/>
fast.<br/>
<br/>
I make a sandwich or two in the morning and cut it and wrap it separately<br/>
and have it in the fridge, ready to grab.   I wash fruit and leave it on<br/>
the counter.   I wash grapes and carrots and put them into little zip loc<br/>
bags.  I always have bananas and nuts and seeds.     <br/>
<br/>
Kids will balance their food consumption naturally as long as they have<br/>
choices.  If the only choice for quick and handy food is chips, etc. then<br/>
that&#39;s what they&#39;ll eat.  If  other choices are just as quick and handy<br/>
they get equal consideration.  <br/>
<br/>
It works!  You&#39;ll survive.  = )<br/>
