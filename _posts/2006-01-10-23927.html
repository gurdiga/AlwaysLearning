<div id="ygrps-yiv-703245049">...they&#39;re going to want stickers and rewards to go with it.<br/>
<br/>
My always radically-unschooled child, Aaron, almost 8, asked me for an<br/>
incentive chart for learning to read.<br/>
<br/>
Apparently he has been talking to his school-in-a-box best friend and<br/>
siblings, and found out their Mom has made these charts for them to<br/>
record how many books they read, and when they get to certain amounts<br/>
they get a reward.  So now his friends are carrying books everywhere<br/>
and not playing much because they have to read so many books by a<br/>
certain date for each reward.  The 10 year old was actually reading on<br/>
New Years Eve while we were over there instead of playing with the kids.  <br/>
<br/>
Even at the park yesterday, two of the older kids brought books and<br/>
read rather than play, because they are trying to read a certain<br/>
number of books by Friday to get their reward, and one was trying to<br/>
negotiate with the mom about getting their reward on Friday even if<br/>
they aren&#39;t quite through with the book.<br/>
<br/>
It had never occured to Aaron that some kids get rewards for doing<br/>
stuff they wouldn&#39;t do anyways, and I guess the novelty of the idea<br/>
appeals to him?<br/>
<br/>
So how should I approach this?  He isn&#39;t letting go, in fact, he asks<br/>
at least a couple times a day since New Years if I have made his<br/>
&quot;reading chart&quot; for him yet. <br/>
<br/>
He has decided his &quot;reward&quot; should be an ice cream cone from Ben &<br/>
Jerry&#39;s on Fridays for doing his lessons (of which he has none because<br/>
I don&#39;t try to teach him to read, or anything else).  His sister works<br/>
at B&J, and he can have an ice cream cone any time he goes there.  So<br/>
it isn&#39;t anything that he couldn&#39;t get just for walking into the store.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have any reading curriculum stuff even in the house, except<br/>
for an old copy of 100 EZ Lessons, and I don&#39;t even know where that is<br/>
right now, so I am not sure what he thinks his &quot;lessons&quot; should look like.<br/>
<br/>
So do I make him a chart and give him some stickers, and let him<br/>
decide when to put them on and for what reasons?  Do I print out<br/>
phonics worksheets from the internet for him to fiddle with for a few<br/>
days?  I can&#39;t imagine this lasting more than a week or two.  *I*<br/>
certainly don&#39;t want to be dragged back into that world of stickers<br/>
and rewards.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyone else ever had a child want to explore the school-at-home world<br/>
a little bit?<br/>

<br/>
I can only tell you how I might approach it...<br/>
I would be really fine with telling a child why this made me<br/>
uncomfortable, that I don&#39;t believe in giving rewards to people for<br/>
doing anything and that I would rather buy them an ice cream when they<br/>
wanted one.<br/>
<br/>
Then, to fulfill the desire, I&#39;d offer to paint a big tree on the wall<br/>
(or something similar) and let them hang leaves with names of books<br/>
they&#39;d read, so the child could keep track if that made them happy.<br/>
I&#39;d offer to go for ice cream every Friday (if that&#39;s the day that is<br/>
mutually agreeable) but not to reward the reading, just to enjoy time<br/>
together.  I&#39;d tell them they can reward themselves as often as they<br/>
wish, and I&#39;ll help them keep track of whatever accomplishemnts they<br/>
wish to keep track of...but I will not be the one deciding to reward<br/>
or not. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if that would help or not.....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-732438345">My seven year old last fall and again over Christmas informed me that <br/>
he wanted to do school every day. So basically, we just sit at the <br/>
table and I have some planned activities (board games, those little <br/>
books with little words that he can color and put together, books to <br/>
read out loud) and let him suggest or if he can&#39;t think of anything, <br/>
I&#39;ll show him what I have. For whatever reason it worked for him. He <br/>
even started writing out math facts!? (Because he was getting <br/>
frustrated by having to add in his head and I mentioned how some <br/>
people just memorize math facts.) I also have a lot of those little <br/>
books with little words that he can read, he picks those up a lot <br/>
because he likes to read and they come with stickers you can put in <br/>
the front cover after you read the book, your child might enjoy that.<br/>
<br/>
I think when a child isn&#39;t exposed to school&#39;s stuff it down your <br/>
throat style of learning sometimes they might want to do some of those <br/>
type activities just for fun as long as we keep it fun, it stays fun. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-463858252">I&#39;d make him one, or make one with him. Set it up however he wants it to look, maybe like a calendar with the days of the week across the top, ending with Friday because that&#39;s the day he wants to do the ice cream. Buy him a little pack of stickers that he can put on himself, ask him what kind of reading he has planned and gather some of it with him, if he needs help. I don&#39;t think the reward is really the point, since it&#39;s something he can have anyway, so I wouldn&#39;t worry about that aspect of it.<br/>
I&#39;d consider it more like playing around with ways of collecting and displaying data. It also seems tied into Erikson&#39;s 4th stage of development, Industry vs. Inferiority, and as I recall it&#39;s pretty normal for kids to want to track achievements in some ways at that age, to have some sort of concrete representation of what they&#39;ve done, especially when it&#39;s a task done over a period of time. The whole badges concept in scouting feeds right into this need, for example. Rain used to make up charts with her daily and weekly routine just to be able to mark X in the little box, no reward required. <br/>
When Rain did these charts, they never lasted very long (although they did evolve into lists, which she still utilizes) and I never made a big deal out of them. They were fun for a while, but kind of a hassle long-term<br/>

 </span></blockquote>============================<br/>
<br/>
Marty said a couple of days ago that he&#39;d always wanted a gold star-- <br/>
to get &quot;a Gold Star.&quot;<br/>
What he had gotten was a candy bar with an overwrap that said &quot;You&#39;re  <br/>
Appreciated! Thank you!&quot; and the whole back was of that theme, saying  <br/>
that the Amount/Serving was Dedication 100%<br/>
Ambition 100%<br/>
Commitment 100%... Excellence, Positive Attitude, Success...<br/>
<br/>
And they handed it to him for answering a question at a training  <br/>
session.  And he said the question he answered was something they had  <br/>
just told him moments before, about what percentage of people would  <br/>
change grocery stores if...[something] and he knew the answer.  He&#39;s  <br/>
working at a grocery store.<br/>
<br/>
And at the next training session he answered some question and got a  <br/>
$5 gift certficate.<br/>
<br/>
Though it reminds me of giving a toddler an M&M for peeing in the  <br/>
potty, Marty was amused and happy that for doing some simple thing he  <br/>
got loot.<br/>
<br/>
-=-So do I make him a chart and give him some stickers, and let him<br/>

certainly don&#39;t want to be dragged back into that world of stickers<br/>
and rewards.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe give him a choice each day of reading aloud (at least words he  <br/>
already knows, or a simple story he already knows, maybe one he  <br/>
dictates and you write down) or of doing a worksheet or of (something  <br/>
else... copying words from a book?  I don&#39;t know) and give him a  <br/>
different colored star for each thing.  If you have stars, I mean.   <br/>
Maybe that would be fun.  Maybe he&#39;ll build up to wanting one star  <br/>
for each thing (like doing three things in one day).  I doubt it will  <br/>
last long either, and  indulging him will probable help him  <br/>
understand how little a deal it is better than refusing him.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re just stars.  It&#39;s not a comparison to other kids.   It&#39;s not  <br/>
against his will.<br/>

Holly.  Holly wanted school and I said I didn&#39;t, but she said she  <br/>
really did, so we made her a folder and I decided (for myself) that  <br/>
every other subject was going to have to be music or art. &lt;g&gt;  And  <br/>
though I think we did it three days (not straight in a row, but all  <br/>
in the same week), she never made it more than half an hour.  Once  <br/>
she did some handwriting practice for a while (while I read a book at  <br/>
a table in front of the little table she was using) and after maybe  <br/>
fifteen minutes she said &quot;Time for recess!&quot; and ran out to play.    <br/>
She figured out it was boring.   I would have done more, but luckily  <br/>
she was over the urge by then.  I think she was probably seven but  <br/>
maybe eight.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-375449988">Emily just turned seven, and on Tuesday asked for some schoolwork to  <br/>
do. I think she misses the regularity of the homeschooling schedule,  <br/>
and she also likes to know the start and beginning of a task. She  <br/>
enjoys workbooks and such. So on Wednesday I printed out some of our  <br/>
easy math sheets, she did what she wanted and felt free to walk away  <br/>
when it got &#39;boring&#39;. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I did find a great kids sudoku site and printed those out yesterday.  <br/>
I didn&#39;t even hand them to the kids, just started working on one of  <br/>
mine. After seconds they began asking to do some of their own...and  <br/>
we probably spent an hour working on them. I was pleased to spend so  <br/>
much time with them doing it, and amazed at how long they spent doing  <br/>
it and how good they were at it.  Thanks for the suggestion Sandra!<br/>
