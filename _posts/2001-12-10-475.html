<div id="ygrps-yiv-847975311"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; I remember reading a parenting column once, it might have been John<br/>
&gt; &gt; Rosemond. He said that parnets should be saying no at least 5 times to<br/>
&gt; &gt; every<br/>
&gt; &gt; yes. Yuck!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;He calls it Vitamin N.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;--pam<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I hope I will be forever-after deficient in this &quot;vitamin&quot;!<br/>

Now here&#39;s the confession. I actually once, while Conor was still in school, <br/>
tried one of Rosemond&#39;s awful suggestions. :-P~~~ It was horrible. We got <br/>
some &quot;positive&quot; school results, but only for as long as we were on top of <br/>
Conor about it. And at what cost to my poor child? I shudder to even think <br/>
about it. I apologized later, told him it was a mistake, and then pulled him <br/>
out of school. Ahhhh....maybe it did have a positive school result. No more <br/>
school.<br/>
