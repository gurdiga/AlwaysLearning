<div id="ygrps-yiv-1978146631">Okay, so I don&#39;t like the use of UN to describe my<br/>
life in all facets.  I don&#39;t even like the term<br/>
Unschooling.  I would rather be defined by what I/we<br/>
do than by what we do not.  Unfooding is not even<br/>
accuarate (as someone pointed out) and neither is<br/>
Unbedding, although DeRegulating might be, but is<br/>
still a negative.  So I will just use the terms <br/>
Natural Living and Natural Learning, and the concept<br/>
of Freedom within the family.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; But what do you do when they are real miserable and<br/>
it&#39;s obvious it&#39;s because they didn&#39;t get enough<br/>
sleep? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are plenty of adults that are like this too, who<br/>
don&#39;t get enough sleep regularly, and what do you do<br/>
with them aside from put up with their miserablness<br/>
and MAYBE gently suggest that they get more sleep?<br/>
<br/>
But with my kids, I find that they often just do not<br/>
want to go to sleep alone.  My oldest in particular,<br/>
is not able to go to sleep in a room where other<br/>
activities are taking place, even if the other<br/>
activities are just me using the computer or talking<br/>
to anyone, but needs to have someone in bed with him. <br/>
If I am reading silently in bed (he goes to sleep in<br/>
my bed) or knitting, or reading to him or something<br/>
like that, he can go to sleep.  It doesn&#39;t take long<br/>
usually.  Less light helps.  <br/>
<br/>
However, you do have to be willing to stop what you<br/>
are doing and take 30 minutes (or more or less) to put<br/>
them down when they are asking you to.  Kids do not<br/>
often use words to ask for this kind of thing.  They<br/>
try to show you by their actions what they need.  The<br/>
younger they are, the less able they are to even<br/>
recognize and articulate their feelings and needs. <br/>
You will know by their actions that they are ready to<br/>
go to bed, and that they want you to help them get<br/>
there.  This is typical kid behavior.  They are<br/>
constantly reaching out to the adults around them<br/>
wanting to be understood, supported, sometimes even<br/>
wanting to be argued with just so they know you are<br/>
paying attention and care enough to take a stand about<br/>
their welfare.  You have to read your kids behavior<br/>
and be available to help them settle into sleep.  Some<br/>
day they will be able to do it on their own (like we<br/>
do) but right now they need us (generally, there are<br/>
always exceptions.)<br/>
<br/>
Generally both my kids fall asleep in my bed (or my<br/>
youngest sometimes requests his own bed after he lies<br/>
with me long enough to get sleepy) and then we move<br/>
them to their own beds after they are asleep.  They<br/>
are welcome to come back if they have bad dreams or<br/>
whatever wakes them up, but none of us sleep well when<br/>
we are all crammed into one bed all night.  They<br/>
usually come tumbling sleepily into our bed in the<br/>
morning for a cuddle before they start their day as<br/>
well, particularly my youngest, who usually asks for<br/>
his own bed at night.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Tickling and teasing probably have never helped a<br/>
&gt;miserable person ever.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree.  I think it is a totally different situation<br/>
for kids to be teasted by adults, because they are not<br/>
on equal footing.  It is like that uncomfortable<br/>
feeling you get when you are teased by your boss or<br/>
another authority figure.  Kids are dependent on<br/>
adults, adults are bigger and in control of the world.<br/>
 They intimidate kids.  Kids have to work up the nerve<br/>
as they grow older to tease back without fear. <br/>
Teasing an out of sorts kid just adds humiliation to<br/>
the bargain.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Kids learn to regulate themselves from failures to do<br/>
&gt;so, not from the words of other people.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is I think the biggest mistake that people make<br/>
in raising kids: never letting them make their own<br/>
mistakes.  For example with this food issue, when I<br/>
was letting go more about food (which was a long<br/>
process because of my older sons many dangerous<br/>
allergies, and he had to be old enough to know caution<br/>
about what he put in his mouth) I recall a incident. <br/>
My younger son, just barely three, had a bag of gummy<br/>
worms, and he decided to eat the whole thing.  After<br/>
that, he threw up.  Now he remembers and doesn&#39;t go<br/>
overboard with sweets, although he has as much of a<br/>
sweet tooth as ever.  He is more inclined to ask for<br/>
tunafish, carrots, a banana, a grilled cheese<br/>
sandwich, before sweets, and he paces himself and<br/>
doesn&#39;t eat too many sweets.  Now if only his brother<br/>
would OD on sweets and learn the same lesson, but he<br/>
seems to have unlimited capacity to live on nothing<br/>
but sugar.  :-/  lol<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And finally, my three year old has been asking to<br/>
sleep with me. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sandra had good suggestions about this.  I will also<br/>
add a couple.  Can you put your mattress set on the<br/>
floor and put addditional ones around for the kids? <br/>
What about a family snuggle or cozy place (as someone<br/>
suggested - forgive me but I am on digest and<br/>
sometimes forget authors unless I cut and paste) where<br/>
the whole family is free to snuggle down at bedtime,<br/>
and then you disperse the kids to their own places<br/>
after they drift off?<br/>
