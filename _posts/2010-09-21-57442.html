<div id="ygrps-yiv-662841162">Living in the moment was a lot easier before my daughter got sick with a<br/>
rare disorder.  Because it&#39;s rare and controversial, I can&#39;t just turn<br/>
blindly to an expert to guide me.  I spend a great deal of time researching<br/>
treatments and doctors who claim to have the answers.  Things are settling<br/>
back down again, now that my daughter is being treated by someone I trust<br/>
and she is getting better.  Spending much of the last year wrapped up in my<br/>
own thoughts was really the reason that I found the right care for my<br/>
daughter, so there is a place and a time, but now that she is on the road to<br/>
recovery, now is the time to get back to living in the moment.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I know my older daughter especially misses that and today I&#39;m going to step<br/>
back into that role which once came easily to me and that I took for granted<br/>
that I&#39;d never have a reason to stop doing.  Today I&#39;m going to spend time<br/>
just being with my girls and enjoying the time. I&#39;m not going to spend it on<br/>
the internet or worrying about what tomorrow will bring.   It will probably<br/>
seem like a blink in time before they are gone and I&#39;m sorry that I&#39;ve<br/>
missed a good chunk of it this last year.<br/>
