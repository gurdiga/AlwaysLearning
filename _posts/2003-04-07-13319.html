<div id="ygrps-yiv-1145098160">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m learning alot about the various ways one can assist an animal or parent out of this world. My dad took the messy way of jumping off a building back in 1973. Poor guy had bad dreams.<br/>
<br/>
We have all been sick, pucking( is this spelled right?) phonically it sounds bad. and such. Seems as soon as I get one set of sheets clean the next kid starts throwing up dinner. I think tomorrow will be barf free. Last in the house with it is sleeping away finally.<br/>
<br/>
Last nigfht we were tired, grumpy. We had little food in the house yesterday and the 2 kids 3, 6 who feel better were starting to get the feed me or else climbing wrestling tired bit going. One asks for cookies. I remember no cookies but we bought gummy worms and he hasn&#39;t seen them for a while so I hand him some and continue making a really lousy dinner. Mac and cheese and raviolis with tomato sauce. Out of a can quick and easy. I only have 1 box of Mac. and all the kids want that. Oldest eats, wants more food, doesn&#39;t like the ravioli and asks for ice-cream. Tim got livid (H) (He wasn&#39;t DH yesterday). He has issues. His downs  syndrom brother eats himself sick alot. His dad had a stroke and used to eat alot of ice cream. His best friend died really young from diabetes. Tim&quot;s dad is diabetic. ISSUES.<br/>
<br/>
Basically we disagree about the freedom of food choices and I was wondering do any of you have spouses who are not totally with you on all issues?<br/>

We did resolve it, but Tim really wants the kids to eat healthy. I think they do, much of the time, make good food choices.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-400486286">Hey Mary, sorry to hear everyone feels sick.  I&#39;ve always said and I <br/>
stand by it today, I&#39;ll take a houseful of head colds any day over the <br/>
stomach flu.<br/>
<br/>
As far as food issues and food freedom, I myself feel that young <br/>
children need to be guided and encouraged with what they eat.  I try to <br/>
not have much &quot;junk&quot; food in the house but if it is here (thanks to dh) <br/>
the girls would choose a bag of Cheetos over dinner.  I would let that <br/>
slide on night maybe, but when they begin to expect that night after <br/>
night I feel it would be wrong not to step in and say no.  If children <br/>
are supposed to a protein daily, and your 2 yr old NEVER chooses <br/>
anything with protein, what&#39;s a mom to do.  Sometimes kids don&#39;t have <br/>
the knowledge to make the right choices.  I try very hard to give them <br/>
choices and options, but in the end it&#39;s my job to make sure they are <br/>
healthy and growing.<br/>
<br/>
I do think that coming off a stomach flu, when your stomach can be <br/>
tender and the body needs to catch up on lost calories, that&#39;s probably <br/>
a good time to be relaxed about what they&#39;re eating.  <br/>
<br/>
My sister&#39;s fil has diabetes and is in the last stages of the disease. <br/>
 It&#39;s very sad.  I think because it is genetic, families with it need to <br/>
be careful.  Maybe if you read up on it and spoke with doctors about <br/>
what threat diabetes is to your family, you could have information to <br/>
show you dh that he could relax a little.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and feel better!   Heidi Case<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We have always had freedom of food choices for our youngest. (The older two <br/>
are now adults.)  My husband&#39;s mother is a diabetic, along with several of <br/>
her 9 siblings, and her father was, too.  My husband has over half of the <br/>
risk factors for developing Type II (adult onset) diabetes.  It is clearly a <br/>
disease brought about by making bad food choices over a long period of time.  <br/>
It seems to me that making good food choices is harder the more insulin <br/>
resistance you develop, so it&#39;s a vicious cycle.  <br/>
<br/>
I do not want my son or my husband to be a diabetic.  My husband and I have <br/>
spent a lot of time learning about the disease and talking about it with an <br/>
eye towards prevention.  I talk to my son about listening to his body when <br/>
he&#39;s hungry, and I help him think about the food he&#39;s eaten lately, and think <br/>
about what opportunities he&#39;s going to have to eat in the near future.  (Are <br/>
we going out to dinner?  What will he eat at company picnic tomorrow?)  On <br/>
occasion I ask if he&#39;s had any protein lately, especially if he&#39;s acting <br/>
listless or grumpy.  He&#39;s done some experimenting with food and the way he <br/>
feels afterward.  Donuts, he&#39;s discovered, make him very sleepy or cranky a <br/>
few hours later.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s okay with him that I ask him questions about what he&#39;s eaten or plans to <br/>
eat.  He knows about diabetes and that he could be at risk, and he knows <br/>
about a lot of other things that could happen as a result of making choices <br/>
with his food (obesity, GERD which also seems to be in his family, etc.).  <br/>
Still, I have rarely if ever said he couldn&#39;t have something he wanted, and I <br/>
don&#39;t label food as &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;.  He has a varied palate, likes to try <br/>
new things, eats way more fruit and vegetables out of his own volition than <br/>
his friend who has been raised vegetarian!  He&#39;s asked for smoked salmon <br/>
because it looked good in the store tho he&#39;d never tried it, and begged for 2 <br/>
weeks for me to take him to try lobster.  (The smell of seafood makes me <br/>
nauseated, I was waiting for Dad to come back from a trip so HE could take <br/>
him!)  The other day we were at the Blue Plate for lunch and he didn&#39;t want <br/>
anything except banana pudding, so we ordered it.  For years the only thing <br/>
he would eat at Mexican restaurants was the cheese dip.  The other night at <br/>
El Nopal he ordered a tamale with rice and beans and cleaned his plate.  <br/>
<br/>
So, I think the whole freedom of food choices thing is working.  My husband <br/>
has been harder to convince, but he learned with the older two, who are his <br/>
step-sons, so the youngest has been spared.  Once, soon after we were <br/>
married, he tried to get in a battle of wills over food with my middle son.  <br/>
Jon eventually complied and ate the food, but as soon as he left the table, <br/>
threw it up on the kitchen floor.  My husband will tell you he was then cured <br/>
of the battle-of-wills part.  <br/>
<br/>
Allowing them to making their own food choices and listening to their bodies <br/>
was a little harder for him.  I asked him to observe the way his mother eats. <br/>
 Her blood sugar is controlled with pills.  Yet her house is filled with <br/>
sweet things.  She cooks lots of good foods, and cans her own vegetables.  <br/>
But it&#39;s as if some doctor told her she could have sweets AS LONG AS she eats <br/>
the good stuff, too.  So she eats a few green beans and a small piece of <br/>
chicken breast, and then loads her plate up with starchy pasta and potatoes <br/>
and her sugar-free cakes (which are made with flour which also turns to sugar <br/>
in the blood).  I&#39;m not blaming her so much as observing this with my own <br/>
eyes.  I believe the disease causes her cravings for sweets, and that&#39;s very <br/>
hard to fight with simple willpower.  The way she cooks is the way my husband <br/>
was raised.  I asked him if he thought that was working?  (Like Dr. Phil, <br/>
&quot;How&#39;s that working for ya?&quot;)  Did it work for him as a child?  Is it working <br/>
for her now?  <br/>
<br/>
He couldn&#39;t say that it worked.  And he realized he didn&#39;t have anything to <br/>
lose by changing it around for his child.  <br/>
<br/>
As with most of the changes unschooling brings to a family, it takes evidence <br/>
seen with their own eyes over time to convince some people.  I asked my <br/>
husband to trust me, and he did, and he became convinced.<br/>

issues? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
yep. Sure do.<br/>
But he is respectful of me and our relationship is ultimately more important <br/>
to him.<br/>
He trusts that I love the kids wholeheartedly, that I wouldn&#39;t do anything <br/>
harmful by choice and that I am very dedicated to their well being.<br/>
He is distracted by work and is NOT as available, and he knows this.<br/>
So he doesn&#39;t say anything about the way I do things (that took some doing) <br/>
and I don&#39;t jump all over him when he handles things in a lame method.<br/>
I am the buffer zone.<br/>
If he reacts badly to the kids, I will say something more general like &quot;it&#39;s <br/>
alright, Mom will help you clean that up, let&#39;s stay calm&quot; if he&#39;s grumpy <br/>
about a mess.<br/>
I am the calm, nice buffer. And that seems to work WAY better than trying to <br/>
tell him he handled something wrong.<br/>
And when he is super nice and handling the kids joyfully, I always comment on <br/>
how happy it makes me to see them enjoying each other, or what a wonderful <br/>
Dad I think he is.<br/>
This has brought us a long ways in a short time.<br/>
<br/>
With food, I am with the kids most of the time, so that isn&#39;t an issue.<br/>
He pretty much just rolls his eyes and stays out of it.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, Sierra was asking for us to take the training wheels off her bike. <br/>
Mark said &quot;on your Birthday we&#39;ll do it, you&#39;re not ready yet&quot; (her Birthday <br/>
is this month).<br/>
I CRINGED when I heard that come out of his mouth, but ignored it and asked <br/>
him to take them off. He repeated the inane comment. I simply said &quot;But she <br/>
wants them off NOW honey, does it really make any difference?&quot; <br/>
And then kept working in the garden, biting my tongue the whole time.<br/>
About 10 minutes later Sierra comes running up proudly proclaiming that Daddy <br/>
took the training wheels off. I smiled to myself and praised the unschooling <br/>
Gods.<br/>
<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>

me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Works here, too.  Older dd would only eat mac and cheese when she was 3, and<br/>
now she relishes trying new foods.  Likes candy, but likes other stuff, too.<br/>
(she was the &quot;experiment child&quot; as I&#39;ve heard some of you say, and I do<br/>
remember once asking her to eat her spinach....it was many years before she<br/>
would eat it again....but we&#39;re past that now).  Younger dd, who has never<br/>
had food of any kind denied or policed, uses candy to decorate with, not to<br/>
eat.  Sometimes a meal is a bag of cheetos, and sometimes it&#39;s a block of<br/>
tofu, and often it&#39;s a bag of cut-up vegetables.  I eat the same way--I will<br/>
eat the same meal every day for a week, and then move on to something else<br/>
next week.<br/>

&gt;&gt;the girls would choose a bag of Cheetos over dinner.  I would let that <br/>
&gt;&gt;slide on night maybe, but when they begin to expect that night after <br/>
&gt;&gt;night I feel it would be wrong not to step in and say no. <br/>
&gt;&gt;    <br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just to offer another opinion, not trying to start another long food <br/>
&gt;discussion.  I feel that if the bag of Cheetos were always there, there was <br/>
&gt;never a fear of Mom saying no, never a fear that this was only a short stay <br/>
&gt;for the Cheetos bag, the child would eventually treat the Cheetos like any <br/>
&gt;other food.  Just as likely to choose an apple as a bag of Cheetos.  It would <br/>
&gt;loose it&#39;s appeal.<br/>
&gt;Just my thoughts.  IT works in our house.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I comment.  I mean - my kids expect me to give them information and if <br/>
 they are filling up on tortilla chips and I think they might not <br/>
 realize that they have almost no protein and that maybe they need some <br/>
 protein, they&#39;ll hear from me. Not in a restrictive shaming way - but <br/>
 in a, &quot;Do you want an egg salad sandwich or maybe just a hardboiled egg <br/>
 to go with that? You can probably use the protein.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If I see the kids wolfing down on the tortilla chips when I know they&#39;re <br/>
really hungry, I remind them that it takes a LOT of chips to get full, but if <br/>
they&#39;ll let me know what MEAL type food they want I&#39;ll make something more <br/>
filling.<br/>
<br/>
I bought two cartons of chocolate pudding today, they&#39;re both gone tonight. I <br/>
was irritated only because *I* wanted some!  I complained that they could <br/>
have at least saved some for me...but then I realized I hadn&#39;t bought it in a <br/>
very long time.<br/>
They hadn&#39;t asked either, so it was just something we hadn&#39;t thought about.<br/>
But it was a BIG sign that we needed to buy more for Trevor (he ate most of <br/>
the two containers) so he wouldn&#39;t feel needy about it!!<br/>
He still has some obsessive behavior about foods I used to say NO about.<br/>
But it&#39;s cool to see the difference and amazing how in touch he is with his <br/>
body.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s the first to cut back on certain foods when he doesn&#39;t feel well.<br/>
And tonight he asked about peanuts. Said they made him feel awful.<br/>
It was one of the foods he tested sensitive to many years ago.<br/>
He knew it without me reminding him or limiting that food in any way. He just <br/>
FEELS it.<br/>
Cool.<br/>

&lt;&lt; For awhile now I&#39;ve had the breakfast cereals down where they can help <br/>
 themselves.  I&#39;m going to do the little baggies and put them low down in <br/>
 the fridge.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Something that works well around here is putting out a platter of cut up <br/>
fruit and veggies.<br/>
Part of the reason that snack foods are so appealing to kids, is it&#39;s very <br/>
easily accessible.  Make healthy choices just as readily available and you&#39;ll <br/>
be surprised what your kids will eat over the course of a day.<br/>
Small sandwiches, washed, prepared fruits, veggies and dips, nuts, dried <br/>
fruit etc .... can all be just as quick as chips or cookies.<br/>
Make homemade cookies for better ingredients if you&#39;re really concerned, buy <br/>
chips made without hydrogenated oils.<br/>
I&#39;ve found many creative ways to bring healthier foods into their lives <br/>
without controlling their choices.<br/>
And if they want something loaded with dye, sugar and preservatives I read <br/>
the label to them and put it into the cart!! :)<br/>
They are learning to be label readers, aware of food choices but not shamed <br/>
or guilted for enjoying the many choices in our society.  One of their <br/>
favorite foods?<br/>
TOFU!  You should see the weird looks we get when we&#39;re in the produce <br/>
section and Sierra shouts &quot;Tofu, Tofu, Tofu Mom! Please get Tofu!!!&quot; <br/>
Too funny.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1099879436">My kids are pretty small and don&#39;t reach everything, but I&#39;ve found when <br/>
they ask for the third or fourth handful of M&M&#39;s or raisins or <br/>
something, if I&#39;ll make a turkey sandwich and quarter it and just lay it <br/>
there without a word (after I fulfilled the request, you understand), <br/>
it&#39;ll usually disappear pretty quick, sometimes before the &quot;goodies&quot; are <br/>
gone.<br/>
