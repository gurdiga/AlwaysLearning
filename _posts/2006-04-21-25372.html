<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248695394">Both of my sons walked around a year.It was never an issue.My daughter <br/>
however is eighteen months and still is not walking.No that&#39;s not true <br/>
she walks but on her knees.This only became a source of concern for me <br/>
after numerous comments by other people(yet once again being <br/>
influenced by what others think,you&#39;d think by NOW....).So after a <br/>
little reserch of my own I found that it is not unusual for children <br/>
to walk &quot;later&quot;so to speak.Eighteen months is <br/>
considered &quot;normal.Ruling out any neurological problems(you would see <br/>
other signs that somthing was up  such as speech,or gross and fine <br/>
motor skill delays),walking in and around two is considered o.k.I <br/>
like  that she &quot;walks to the beat of her own drum:)</div>
