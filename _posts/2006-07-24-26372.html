Once in a while I have a big shiver at ever having been pressed to  <br/>
support all homeschoolers, as we&#39;re all doing the same thing and need  <br/>
to remember we&#39;re all in this together.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I was working on my webpages, making sure pages are linked to  <br/>
at least three or five other places, and got to poking around a site  <br/>
I&#39;ve had linked for a couple of years.<br/>
<br/>
On the curriculum pages, every grade first through fifth has one book  <br/>
listed for literature/English.  Same book every year.  It&#39;s an anti- <br/>
Halloween novel.  I&#39;m definitely ordering one.  It&#39;s on sale now.   <br/>
So  The first five years are Bible study and anti-Halloween, and  <br/>
after that the girls start studying quiltmaking.<br/>
<br/>
They have a page on chores.  Here&#39;s how they recommend you reward  <br/>
kids for chores:<br/>
<br/>
1. For a young student in grades K-6, award your successful worker  <br/>
with stickers or points that can be tallied. When a goal set by you  <br/>
is reached, give your hard worker a small treat (fruit, snack, piece  <br/>
of gum, etc.) Award this treat once a week for this age group.<br/>
<br/>
2. For an older student in grades 7-12, most families pay their  <br/>
workers a certain monetary amount for each chore completed. You will  <br/>
have to decide what that amount may be, based on your family budget.  <br/>
Then pay your diligent worker once a month.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes maybe it helps to see what I&#39;m not doing as an unschooler,  <br/>
and to remind myself why I really don&#39;t want to relax my stance on  <br/>
fundamentalist school at home.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and not to defend witchcraft or anything, but one of the two  <br/>
articles on the site confuses witchcraft and crime with evolution, it  <br/>
seems:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-DISCERNING EVOLUTION IN CURRICULA<br/>
<br/>
=Have you ever enjoyed the pictures in a book so much that you missed  <br/>
the fact that the book was for evolution? Have you ever enjoyed the  <br/>
story in a book so much that you missed the fact that it used a dark  <br/>
side of life like crime to entertain you? Have you ever liked the  <br/>
cover of a book so much that you bought it and gave it to your child,  <br/>
not ever knowing that the content contained witchcraft ideas with the  <br/>
intent of subtly indoctrinating your child into these practices?<br/>
<br/>
-=-These examples sound a bit extreme and you may say, no never me.  <br/>
But in fact, concepts that are pro-evolution, divorce, witchcraft,  <br/>
crime, etc., are often woven into a book in ways that you may not be  <br/>
detecting. These concepts may be placed in books on purpose to subtly  <br/>
indoctrinate, or they may be there because the culture that is  <br/>
preparing the books has been compromised by sin without even knowing  <br/>
they have been...-=-   (and it continues)  http:// <br/>
www.thefathersbooks.com/Articles.htm<br/>
<br/>
and goes on to say some exceedingly strange things.  It says  <br/>
evolution sets animals above men, as the original parents of men, and  <br/>
that books or TV shows that have talking animals support evolution.   <br/>
I guess that would include Mickey Mouse and all those puppets on  <br/>
Sesame Street.  &quot;These books, curricula, and shows purposely or  <br/>
subtly use animals to indoctrinate the public into accepting,  <br/>
supporting, and living under and within the concept of evolution.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What they&#39;re doing is NOT what I&#39;m doing.  I would way rather my kids  <br/>
go to public school than    I would like to defend that kind of  <br/>
homeschooling.  I&#39;m betting they would rather their kids go to public  <br/>
school than to treat them the ways that our family treats ours.<br/>
<br/>
Saturday night Holly left the house at 11:00 and came home at 4:30  <br/>
a.m.  Kirby knew she had left, but she didn&#39;t leave me a note, and  <br/>
apologized profusely the next day, because she realized after she was  <br/>
gone that if I woke up after Kirby went to sleep I wouldn&#39;t know  <br/>
where she was.  She was with Marty (her brother), Sadie and Brett  <br/>
(two now-grown unschoolers of our long acquaintance.  They played  <br/>
miniature golf and then went to Sadie&#39;s house and played and talked.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re not living a small, fearful lives.<br/>
