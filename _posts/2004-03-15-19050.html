<div id="ygrps-yiv-934024951">There was a discussion at unschooling.com&#39;s message board lately where I <br/>
suggested people tell a child that reading takes a long time to get.  Someone else <br/>
said her child got it quickly, so it would be dishonest to say that.  I said <br/>
if he seemed to get it quickly, he had been gathering clues and preparedness <br/>
for a long time before that.  And the conversation went back and forth.<br/>

If you go straight there with the link, you might want to read the archived <br/>
pages up above to get the whole conversation.   If I give the link to the first <br/>
archive, it won&#39;t lead to later stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Or you can go to &quot;topics&quot; when you get to the message boards and it&#39;s this:<br/>
