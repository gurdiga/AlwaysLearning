<div id="ygrps-yiv-261009424">It sounded familiar to me, so I googled.  The two you mentioned did<br/>
write it.  It&#39;s a country song sung by Lee Ann Womack.  I can&#39;t figure<br/>
out why it sounded familiar to me, since I don&#39;t listen to country and<br/>
never heard of the singer.  I&#39;ll drive myself crazy for a while figuring<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-541897890">I found this poem in a journal I bought from Borders Bookstore Saturday <br/>
night. It&#39;s unsigned, so I&#39;ll put the names of the people on the cover <br/>
as the authors: Mark D. Sanders & Tia Sillers.<br/>
<br/>
The blank journal is called I Hope You Dance Journal.<br/>
The poem is called &quot;I Hope You Dance.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I hope you never lose your sense of wonder<br/>
You get your fill to eat but always keep that hunger<br/>
May you never take one single breath for granted<br/>
God forbid love ever leave you empty-handed<br/>
I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean<br/>
Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens<br/>
Promise me that you&#39;ll give faith a fighting chance<br/>
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance<br/>
I hope you dance...I hope you dance<br/>
<br/>
I hope you never fear those mountians in the distance<br/>
Never settle for the path of least resistance<br/>
Livin&#39; might mean takin&#39; chances but they&#39;re worth takin&#39;<br/>
Lovin&#39; might be a mistake but it&#39;s worth makin&#39;<br/>
Don&#39;t let some hell-bent heart leave you bitter<br/>
When you come close to sellin&#39; out, reconsider<br/>
Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance<br/>
And when you get the chance to sit it out or dance<br/>
I hope you dance...I hope you dance<br/>
<br/>
Time is a wheel in constant motion always rolling us along<br/>
Tell me who wants to look back on their years and wonder<br/>
Where those years have gone<br/>
I hope you dance...I hope you dance<br/>
I hope you dance.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all I really want for my daughters. To never look back with regret.<br/>
Have a wonderful day, everybody! HeidiC.<br/>
<br/>

&quot;A man is rich in proportion to the number of things which he can afford <br/>
to let alone.&quot;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-893341671">I Hope You Dance received a lot of airplay on non-country stations too.  Lee Ann Womack recorded two or three versions of the song.<br/>
<br/>
Two years ago, they played it at the opening of my daughter&#39;s dance recital, while showing videos from the classes and the non-dress rehearsal.  It really brought tears to my eyes.  It is a wonderful song.<br/>

Did your book have the CD?  I bought dd a copy of that book with the song on a CD enclosed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1210905347">No, the book didn&#39;t come with a CD.  It&#39;s funny how at times like this I <br/>
realize how backwards I can be.  It just figures that if I come across <br/>
something like this I&#39;ll be like &quot;Ohhhhh.  That&#39;s so cool.&quot; and then I <br/>
find out everyone has known about it for years.  Oh well, I&#39;m glad I <br/>
finailly found about it.  Now I want to get my hands on the song so I <br/>
can sing it to the girls at bedtime.   HeidiC.<br/>

Yes this is absolutely one of my favs. We don&#39;t listen to country but I saw <br/>
her perform this song on Oprah a few years ago and it made me cry. That was <br/>
before it had been released for radio broadcast. The first time I heard it on <br/>
the radio, I turned it up and told my girls to listen to the words. Since <br/>
then we always call it &quot;our song&quot;. Recently we went summer clothes shopping <br/>
and it came on while the twins were in the dressing room. The lady that hands <br/>
out the little numbers of how many items you can take in was just dying while <br/>
hearing my girls sing their hearts out, she had tears in her eyes and said it <br/>
was the most beautiful thing she had ever heard. Neither of them can sing a <br/>
lick so I knew she meant the fact that they were yelling &quot;Mommy, our song is <br/>
on...&quot;and proceeding to sing as if we were at home or in the car. Seeing this <br/>
stranger so moved by the twins reaction to &quot;our song&quot; had me in tears too. It <br/>
was truly moving.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-460643532">Ohhh, Rhonda.  I can just picture them singing!  I&#39;m going to copy the <br/>
words and put them into each girl&#39;s baby book and for my nieces and <br/>
nephew, too.  Actually, now that I&#39;m thinking of it, maybe I&#39;ll start a <br/>
journal for each filled with cool lyrics and poems.  I could give it to <br/>
them as a wedding present or something.  Maybe when they have their <br/>
first child.  Oh, I can&#39;t wait to get started.  I&#39;d better go get some <br/>
more of those journals!  HeidiC.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1785987751">I just love the internet! How did we ever get along without it? I read the posts about the Lee Ann Womack song. I thought it was great so I went and downloaded the .mp3 with KaZaA, then I went to the cowpie song corral and got the lyrics and guitar chords, then I spent the rest of the afternoon playing and singing it! <br/>
<br/>
  I never would have heard of the song in the first place, if it weren&#39;t for this list, and even if I had I would have had to wait till I went to town, buy the CD and then work out the music myself. I probably wouldn&#39;t have bothered.<br/>

I not very computer literate and I can&#39;t play guitar, I guess I&#39;m going <br/>
