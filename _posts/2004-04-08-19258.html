Lexie is washing Janene&#39;s hair.  This is a first.  I&#39;m listening to them <br/>
talk.  Janene is worried about it and Lexie says &quot;It&#39;s OK, Janene, I&#39;ll <br/>
be really gentle.  OK, I&#39;ll tell you everything I do before I do it.  <br/>
Now, let&#39;s get your hair wet.&quot;  And so forth. <br/>
<br/>
The loving gentleness in her voice is incredible.  I hope I do sound <br/>
like that, most of the time.  Not all the time I know, but most of the <br/>
time.<br/>

That is so sweet.<br/>
<br/>
Washing hair isn&#39;t easy.  Sounds like a good project all the way around.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1758340970">I had to add to your post because I was thinking about *how* Chloe <br/>
plays with different people (friends) and she really likes playing <br/>
with Janene. <br/>
<br/>
After our park day last week she said &quot;Wow, Janene and I were having <br/>
so much fun I didn&#39;t want to leave. We have such big imaginations <br/>
when we are together and she and I go on so many adventures. We can <br/>
just play whatever and it is so exciting and we are sneaky and spy-<br/>
like when we play.&quot; You should see them Joylyn, it is pretty funny. <br/>
They really are stealthy at the park when they play. I think they <br/>
reap great joy out of their inner world together. Bite my tongue, <br/>
but they never squabble, they are so much on the same &quot;play&quot; page. <br/>
Just thought I would add to how they are always learning yes...and I <br/>
consider a good play at the park in your own inner world &quot;learning&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Thoughtfully,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-173413388">That is so cool Joylyn. I love to see sibling relationships evolve <br/>
and grow. <br/>
<br/>
A few weeks ago I walked in on Gavin (almost 6) giving Avery (almost <br/>
4) a karate lesson. He had her down on the floor and he was teaching <br/>
her how to stretch, complete with his sensei&#39;s Japanese accent :) He <br/>
was so patient with her, and she was beaming after he taught her a <br/>
few punches and kicks. He was upset that she was too young to take <br/>
karate with him, but later told us that it was okay because he would <br/>
just teach her all of the moves that he learned so that she would be <br/>
super-good when she finally turns five and can take the class. <br/>
