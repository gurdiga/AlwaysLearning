<div id="ygrps-yiv-1157601753">8. Let kids learn. Don&#39;t protect them or control them so much that  <br/>
they don&#39;t get needed experience. But, don&#39;t use the excuse of  <br/>
&quot;natural consequences&quot; to teach them a lesson. Instead, exemplify  <br/>
kindness and consideration. If you see a toy left lying in the  <br/>
driveway, don&#39;t leave it there to be run over, pick it up and set it  <br/>
aside because that is the kind and considerate thing to do and  <br/>
because kindness and consideration are values you want to pass on to  <br/>
your kids. Natural consequences will happen, they are inevitable. But  <br/>
it isn&#39;t &quot;natural&quot; anymore if you could have prevented it, but chose  <br/>
not to do so.<br/>
