<div id="ygrps-yiv-1107972705">I am not perfect.  I don&#39;t claim to know everything about <br/>
unschooling.  I am new to unschooling and that is why I ask for <br/>
others opinions.  I however don&#39;t like to be told that I am not an <br/>
unschooler because it leaves me no room for growth.  Either I have it <br/>
or I don&#39;t and if I don&#39;t, I am not an unschooler. If I don&#39;t have it <br/>
and I am not an unschooler, then I don&#39;t belong in this group. I have <br/>
decided to leave the group because I have more important things to do <br/>
than spend my time defending myself.  <br/>
<br/>
I am moving on to better things......... A place where I am allowed <br/>
to continue on my journey of unschooling. <br/>

If you haven&#39;t left the list already, just sit back and read the posts for a<br/>
while.  Get a feeling for how the list works.  IDEAS are discussed on this<br/>
and many other unschooling lists.  Most aren&#39;t considered support groups but<br/>
discussion groups.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Really, no one was attacking you.  They were just trying to get you to<br/>
examine your thoughts and ideas a little more closely.  Like when you word<br/>
something with the words &quot;I can&#39;t&quot;, (about going outside in the winter)<br/>
someone (me in this case) might point out that everything in life is a<br/>
choice and that&#39;s a better way to think about it.  If you think of having<br/>
limited choices, then you will limit yourself.  The world is wide open and<br/>
everything is a choice.  So instead of saying, &quot;I can&#39;t&quot;   it would be more<br/>
accurate to say, &quot;I choose not to&quot; or to just give more details about why<br/>
going outside doesn&#39;t work for you at this point.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It is hard to get outside with little ones but for me it was important.<br/>
There are a variety of ways to keep a little child&#39;s hands warm.  Maybe put<br/>
long warm socks on over his hands before you put his coat on, ones that go<br/>
all the way up his arms.  Maybe invest in some 99 cent hand warmers for him<br/>
to hold.  Maybe he would like to hold a warm rice bag.  Maybe if your dd<br/>
found an activity that she likes outside, she&#39;d be more willing to go<br/>
outside.  These lists are great for brainstorming ideas.  I am not saying<br/>
take a very unwilling child kicking and screaming out into the cold if she<br/>
really protests, but maybe there are specific things that will help her to<br/>
enjoy being outside, if its something that is important to you.  For me,<br/>
going outside always broke up the monotony, even if it was just for a short<br/>
time.  It refreshed me and helped me to be a more patient mother.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I am so thankful that ideas are discussed on these lists.  They have helped<br/>
me grow immensely and to become a better parent.  Maybe they&#39;ll help you<br/>
too, if you stick around.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It appears that poster has left, but I want to comment on the above statements.<br/>
<br/>
I thought I was an unschooler long before I really was.  As I read, explore, and practice these ideas that were brand new to me 4 or 5 years ago, I continue to understand more.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure where I stand now on being a *real unschooler*, but I&#39;ve come to see that my first understandings of it were only partially right.  Perhaps I became an unschooler on the first day I decided that I wanted to be one, but I still have much to learn and hope that I continue to grow in learning to live a joyful life and enabling my children to do the same.<br/>
