<div id="ygrps-yiv-1573086258">Whenever I think about co-sleeping in older children I think about a book by Marjorie Shostak  called Nisa: The Life and Words of a !Kung Woman. It&#39;s the autobiography of a Dobe !Kung woman as framed within the narration that Marjorie Shostak gives it. I don&#39;t know why the text from that book stuck with me, but there are passages in the book where Nisa talks about becoming aware of her parents having sex while she coslept. There is a passage in the beginning of a chapter called Discovering Sex that describes the sleeping arrangements (without reference to age, the !Kung don&#39;t have any calendar, usually the aging of individuals comes from using the data that the Herero, their neighbors kept of who was born when who the !Kung knew to be roughly the same age. &quot;Parents and children sleep together, sharing their blankets, in small one-room huts that have no dividers or private sections.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Meredith Small has this to say in the book Our Babies, Ourselves  (oh, a quick search gave me a similar piece from an article she wrote here:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.mothering.com/articles/new_baby/sleep/small.html)">http://www.mothering.com/articles/new_baby/sleep/small.html)</a>:<br/>
<br/>
In Appalachia or eastern Kentucy, co-sleeping in infancy and childhood is the norm, as it has been for hundreds of years &lt;there is a citation to a paper that I&#39;d like to access&gt;. Although the people of this area are not an &quot;ethnic minority&quot; or recent immigrants, they do represent a chesive population that has been resistant to change. Historians note that in colonial times on the eastern seaboard in the United States, several people slept in the same bed--it was the only way to sleep in such small houses (cit. Tobacco Colony: Life in Early Maryland 1650-1720. G. Main). But when new ideas about privacy began to appear in the nineteenth centruy, housing reflected thos changes and suddenly there were private sleeping rooms, first in public houses and then in private homes. The people of Appalachia, descendants of that more colonial tradition, continued the communal sleeping arrangement and even now refuse to place babies alone even when there is plenty of<br/>
 room. Contrary to the advice given by pediatricians in the area, these mothers place their babies in the parental bed because they believe in their particular parenting ideology. As anthropologist Susan Abbott points out, &quot;What it [co-sleeping] is not is some kind of quaint holdover from an archaic past, nor is it pathological in its constitution or outcome for the majority of those who experience it. It is a current, well-situated pattern of child rearing that is withstanding the onslaught of advice by contemporary childcare experts.&quot; The point is to make a tightly knit family and keep children close. Seventy-five-year-old Verna Mae Sloane writes of motherhood in Appalachia: &quot;How can you expect to hold on to them in life if you begin by pushing them away?&quot; (cit. Common Folks, Sloane, V.M., 1978) Again, the ideology guiding co-sleeping in such cultures is one of attachment rather than independence. <br/>
<br/>
Oh, here&#39;s a nice little piece: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nd.edu/~jmckenn1/lab/longterm.html,">http://www.nd.edu/~jmckenn1/lab/longterm.html,</a> a couple of snippets: <br/>
<br/>
In a survey of adult college age subjects, Lewis<br/>
and Janda (2) report that males who coslept with their parents between<br/>
birth and five years of age had significantly higher self-esteem,<br/>
experienced less guilt and anxiety, and reported greater frequency of<br/>
sex. Boys who coslept between 6 and 11 years of age also had higher<br/>
self-esteem. For women, cosleeping during childhood was associated with<br/>
less discomfort about physical contact and affection as adults. (While<br/>
these traits may be confounded by parental attitudes, such findings are<br/>
clearly inconsistent with the folk belief that cosleeping has<br/>
detrimental long-term effects on psycho-social development.<br/>
<br/>
* A study of parents of 86<br/>
children in clinics of pediatrics and child psychiatry (ages 2-13<br/>
years) on military bases (offspring of military personnel) revealed<br/>
that cosleeping children received higher evaluations of their<br/>
comportment from their teachers than did solitary sleeping children,<br/>
and they were underrepresented in psychiatric populations compared with<br/>
children who did not cosleep. The authors state: &quot;Contrary to<br/>
expectations, those children who had not had previous professional<br/>
attention for emotional or behavioral problems coslept more frequently<br/>
than did children who were known to have had psychiatric intervention,<br/>
and lower parental ratings of adaptive functioning. The same finding<br/>
occurred in a sample of boys one might consider &quot;Oedipal victors&quot; (e.g.<br/>
3 year old and older boys who sleep with their mothers in the absence<br/>
of their fathers)--a finding which directly opposes traditional<br/>
analytic thought&quot; (4). <br/>

Subject: [AlwaysLearning] Need &#39;supporting&#39; links, etc.<br/>
<br/>
My Mil (who is really cool and we get along beautifully) just came <br/>
for a visit.  She almost always (yes, that&#39;s a true use of words <br/>
there) has questions or concerns about our lifestyle that we address <br/>
in a supportive manner.  We LIKE that she ask questions and she LIKES <br/>
that we give her information regarding her concerns.  After her <br/>
visits we typically send her weblinks that support our &#39;answers&#39;.  <br/>
<br/>
Here are two concerns she had that we need further information that <br/>
supports our decisions.  If anyone can supply website links, etc. we <br/>
would appreciate it. <br/>
<br/>
Here goesâ€¦<br/>
<br/>
She is concerned with Tails being 11-years-old and co-sleeping.  She <br/>
thinks that it is/will inhibit Tails from being independent.  We have <br/>
only been able to find &#39;infant&#39; co-sleep info - is there anything <br/>
about older children and co-sleeping out there?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-322366596">-=-Historians note that in colonial times on the eastern seaboard in  <br/>
the United States, several people slept in the same bed--it was the  <br/>
only way to sleep in such small houses (cit. Tobacco Colony: Life in  <br/>
Early Maryland 1650-1720. G. Main). -=-<br/>
<br/>
In one of the castle/stately-home combos near Cambridge, England,  <br/>
there&#39;s a bed that&#39;s really wide, made for a whole family.  About  <br/>
four times wider than long, I think.<br/>
(I have notes somewhere of where exactly I was...)<br/>
<br/>
At our old house, I started off sleeping with the kids in their room  <br/>
(a double bed under a single bed, after a while, but a double bed  <br/>
before Holly was born), and would go in with Keith sometime later in  <br/>
the night, or one of the kids would, maybe.   When Holly was born we  <br/>
got a bunk bed and Kirby slept on top.<br/>
<br/>
When we moved to a bigger house so the kids could have their own  <br/>
room, we all slept together the first many times we were in the  <br/>
house, before we had lots of furniture.  Keith was in Minneapolis,  <br/>
and the house was big and spooky.  We moved a mattress from room to  <br/>
room and slept in many different rooms, all together (me and the  <br/>
kids).  It was fun.<br/>
<br/>
When Holly had her own room, I slept with her lots of times, at least  <br/>
until she was asleep.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of years ago she went through a time of wanting me to go to  <br/>
sleep in her room, either reading to her or just being there while  <br/>
she stayed up and read or played games.  She was 14 and around there.<br/>
<br/>
I think one thing to consider in these modern situations is that  <br/>
having the option to sleep with parents when one has his own bed  <br/>
elsewhere isn&#39;t the same as being forced from necessity or tradition  <br/>
to sleep with the parents whether or not one wants to.  And my  <br/>
sleeping with my kids because I wanted to was a choice, and so  <br/>
there&#39;s a  happiness and a giving there that is missing in both the  <br/>
&quot;sleep in your own bed&quot; model and the &quot;we all share the bed because  <br/>
it&#39;s the only bed&quot; model.<br/>

<br/>
I wish I could have found the information about co-sleeping in Japanese<br/>
culture, instead of just references to it.  It seems that part of the<br/>
idea in Japanese culture is that co-sleeping helps keep everyone<br/>

of the sleep studies done in anthropological research as well.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m reading a book right now that takes place in the Ireland and<br/>
Scotland and they made reference to the fact that all kids co-slept with<br/>
each other if they weren&#39;t sleeping with their parents, and it was<br/>
referencing the 1930&#39;s, so really not that long ago.  It&#39;s fiction,<br/>
though, so no references.  The book is &quot;Dream Angus&quot; for anyone<br/>
interested, it&#39;s largely about celtic gods and mythology.  It also<br/>
happens to be the first chapter book that Margaux has allowed me to read<br/>
to her.  It isn&#39;t a kid&#39;s book though.<br/>
<br/>
I read several things also referencing European cultures, in general<br/>
co-sleep, at least with babies and young children, and that is way more<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1914320356">In the 30s because of poverty, my dad and his siblings slept in the same<br/>
room (and maybe sometimes the same bed) as his parents.  Co sleeping was<br/>
considered a thing of the past in our home when I was growing up, a by<br/>
product of the circumstances brought about by the Great Depression era.  Not<br/>
normal or a good but an embarrassing problem that couldn&#39;t be done away with<br/>
at the time.<br/>
<br/>
Both Brian and I remember as do many of our generation wanting to sleep with<br/>
mom and dad instead of alone or with a sibling (also frowned on in our home<br/>
when I was a child).  I was less afraid of the dark than one of my sisters<br/>
was.  I often walked her to the bathroom after bedtime.  She&#39;s still afraid<br/>
of the dark, and for whatever reason (people are different), I&#39;m not spooked<br/>
by it.  Karl is definitely afraid of the dark but getting less so as time<br/>
goes by and I give him ideas for how to deal with it and go with him<br/>
whenever he wants me to.  And of course I feel that knowing he can always<br/>
have us to be with at night is the biggest deterrent to prolonged fear and<br/>
feelings of incompetence.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1578706992">Thanks so much for all the links, words, etc.  There&#39;s lot&#39;s of great <br/>
perspectives and info that will help my Mil.  I&#39;m not the best with <br/>
words sometimes so I value the thoughts that I can forward to her.  I <br/>
know that she will appreciate them also.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I read that you and your mom or MIL like to debate these things&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We debate politics, religion, and all the things that hairstylist are <br/>
not supposed to discuss with clients. &lt;g&gt;.  I guess we don&#39;t <br/>
necessarily debate (too heated and emotional) my family&#39;s choice of <br/>
lifestyle but we do ponder different topics based on my family&#39;s <br/>
choices.  It&#39;s in the same way Tails and I would discuss our <br/>
differences of opinions.  It&#39;s supportive and respectful Â– both <br/>
ways.  <br/>
<br/>
Yes, I do know that `our family&#39;s choice is ours&#39; but I am also <br/>
respectful of someone who raised my husband.   She&#39;s known all the <br/>
particulars of our radical unschooling journey from the beginning.  <br/>
She truly asks questions to understand why & what we are doing.  <br/>
She&#39;s got 5 other grandkids whose family&#39;s all do it `one way&#39;.  I <br/>
treat her questions the same as I would Tails.  <br/>
<br/>
Radical unschooling is about partnerships to me Â– I can&#39;t promote <br/>
(cruddy choice of words) that to Tails if I&#39;m blowing off what I <br/>
consider innocent questions from her Grandmama.  The relationship is <br/>
more important to me than the control of being right, etc.  She <br/>
doesn&#39;t agree with many of our choices, but she does support us <br/>
respectfully.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Frankly, some of our best discussions and communication is done in <br/>
the bed late<br/>
at night--all of us in the dark (somewhat) and the kids really <br/>
connect with us<br/>
and with each other in ways that maybe the light of day inhibits. <br/>
These<br/>
memories, this comfort, I am sure, will be the things we all hold on <br/>
tight to<br/>
throughout our lives.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
YES, YES, YES.  Tails has her `day persona&#39; (strong, independent, <br/>
self-assured).  At night, I get her `night persona&#39; (little girl, <br/>
needs her Mama, has many questions, big emotions).  If I told Tails <br/>
to `get in your room and go to bed&#39; I would NEVER have the <br/>
opportunity to share this special part of her.  Hmmmm, I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
even know it exists.  I&#39;m grateful for our `nights&#39; together.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much again.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
In English history and literature there are lots of mentions of co- <br/>
sleeping among adults and adults with children, though not the  <br/>
parents (in what I&#39;m thinking of).<br/>
<br/>
In families with money and &quot;houses&quot; (as opposed to cottages or  <br/>
hovels), there was a nurse hired to watch the children at night and  <br/>
she slept with them, or if the family was rich there might be one  <br/>
nurse for each child.  This is still true in some wealthy families  <br/>
with  nannies--maybe not in the same bed, but the one to get up at  <br/>
night if a baby cries.<br/>
<br/>
Older kids slept with other older kids.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read that in inns and pubs, in the 19th century and before,  <br/>
sometimes paying to stay the night involved sharing a bed with a  <br/>
stranger.  So two  men who didn&#39;t even know each other might be in  <br/>
the same bed.<br/>

There was also a lot of turn-of-the-century advice that sleeping  <br/>

Dh is German, and when we first started going to his parents&#39; place, I<br/>
was horrified that his parents&#39; bedroom was always around 15 degrees<br/>
Celsius (59 degrees F.)  <br/>
<br/>
The window open at night thing was an ongoing battle between dh and I<br/>
for a long time.  He claimed there was not enough oxygen in the room<br/>
if the window was closed.  But now I got used to it and we sleep with<br/>
the window open most nights (and turn the heat off, or at least down.)  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1733621033">David got the paper about Appalachian co-sleeping practices and it has a wonderful review of the literature on co-sleeping. Sharon Abbott mentions a study about Japanese co-sleeping: &quot;Caudill and Plath&#39;s (1966) well-known study ofJapanese sleeping locations describes their practices throughout the life span, making this an unusual study. They report that the Japanese age of transi- tion away from sleeping with parents is 11, with the process not complete until 15 or 16 years. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
The paper is really fascinating. Sharon Abbott is arguing that early family co-sleeping is one of a series of strategies that a parent uses to create a close relationship, an interdependence between parent and child that lasts into adulthood with children continuing to live near their parents. In a paper comparing family characteristics and dynamics in Japan and the U.S. (and so titled) the abstract is this: <br/>
<br/>
This paper uses the Family Environment Scale (FES) to compare and<br/>
contrast psychosocial environments of Japanese families with those of<br/>
American families. The aim is to explore some cultural dynamics of each<br/>
society from the point of view of family behavior. The FES contains 10<br/>
subscales, measuring the following family characteristics: Cohesion,<br/>
Expressiveness, Conflict, Independence, Achievement Orientation,<br/>
Intellectual-Cultural Orientation, Active-Recreational Orientation,<br/>
Moral-Religious Emphasis, Organization, and Control. Comparison of each<br/>
subscale between Japan and the United States revealed that: (a)<br/>
Cohesion and Control were positively correlated for Japanese parents<br/>
but negatively correlated for American parents; (b) Achievement<br/>
Orientation and Intellectual-Cultural Orientation were positively<br/>
correlated for Japanese parents and uncorrelated for American parents;<br/>
(c) Cohesion and Control were negatively correlated for American<br/>
children but uncorrelated for Japanese children; and (d) Achievement<br/>
and Conflict were positively correlated for Japanese children but<br/>
uncorrelated for American children. Eight of the 10 constructs were<br/>
useful for understanding family dynamics in Japan. Independence and<br/>
Expressiveness, which are important for American families, did not seem<br/>
to be easily understood concepts for the Japanese. The results and the<br/>
implications are discussed in terms of cross-cultural understanding<br/>
between Japan and the United States.<br/>
<br/>
I found it looking for Caudill and Plath&#39;s study. I also found a paper (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/153/4/339)">http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/153/4/339)</a> that said this: <br/>
<br/>
The 2 cultures endow the child as an organism differently. <br/>
In Japan, the infant is seen more as a separate biological organismwho from the beginning, in order to develop, needs to be drawninto increasingly interdependent relations with others. In America,the infant is seen more as a dependent biological organism who,in order to develop, needs to be made increasingly independentof others.22(p15)<br/>
Both cultures acknowledge that isolating a child at night isstressful but interpret the experience differently. In the UnitedStates, solitary sleep is thought to engender independence inchildren23 and ensure privacy for parents.6 These values supersedethe child&#39;s perceived need. United States values of self-relianceand self-assertion lead mothers to encourage more play withobjects and more attention to the environment than is seen inJapan.24 Night-time counterparts may be found in the use ofpacifiers and transitional objects to encourage infants to fallasleep alone.25The Japanese acknowledge the same developmental struggle withseparation, but, in acceding to the child&#39;s need, emphasizethe value of dependence as the primary socializing experience.The Japanese word for a common cosleeping arrangement demonstratesthis value. &quot;The custom of the child sleeping between the parentsis referred to as kawa. Kawa is the Japanese character for ariver flowing between<br/>
 2 banks and kawa is therefore used torefer to the child sleeping between the protective support ofthe 2 parents.&quot;26(p138) Other cultures or  subgroups seem tohave a similar emphasis.27-29 Thus, the balance between interdependencyand autonomy is a useful framework in considering cultural differencesin childrearing practices.30-32<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I don&#39;t know if that helps with anything or gives you more ideas to discuss with your mother-in-law. But I found it an interesting perspective on the outcomes of co-sleeping. When David looked at co-sleeping in the northeast of the UK he found that it correlated heavily with other attachment practices like extended breastfeeding and sling carrying. It makes sense if it is seen as a parental strategy (I&#39;m not arguing that it is a strategy that someone is aware of) for bonding children to parents and to create a more interdependent family structure that those things would be associated. It also makes sense that the bonding that occurs in those first few moments of breastfeeding, producing such a huge oxytocin response and bio feedback loop, would produce all of those correlations as well. <br/>

And my<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; sleeping with my kids because I wanted to was a choice, and so<br/>
&gt; there&#39;s a happiness and a giving there that is missing in both the<br/>
&gt; &quot;sleep in your own bed&quot; model and the &quot;we all share the bed because<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s the only bed&quot; model.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Something I discovered when I was trying to find articles or links to<br/>
information, was the idea that co-sleeping started to die off because<br/>
people could afford bigger houses and more beds, so within that idea it<br/>
becomes an issue of &quot;have&quot; and &quot;have not&quot;, when really the issue is<br/>
probably more of a biological one.  So the reasoning behind co-sleeping<br/>
or no co-sleeping has become a confused issue, then throw in the whole<br/>
psychoanalyst &quot;sex&quot; aspect, and you have an idea that&#39;s been twisted<br/>
into something that it&#39;s not.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I could have found the information about co-sleeping in Japanese<br/>
culture, instead of just references to it.  It seems that part of the<br/>
idea in Japanese culture is that co-sleeping helps keep everyone<br/>
cohesive and bound to one another and dependent on one another through<br/>
family, within society at large.  That seems to follow through with some<br/>
of the sleep studies done in anthropological research as well.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m reading a book right now that takes place in the Ireland and<br/>
Scotland and they made reference to the fact that all kids co-slept with<br/>
each other if they weren&#39;t sleeping with their parents, and it was<br/>
referencing the 1930&#39;s, so really not that long ago.  It&#39;s fiction,<br/>
though, so no references.  The book is &quot;Dream Angus&quot; for anyone<br/>
interested, it&#39;s largely about celtic gods and mythology.  It also<br/>
happens to be the first chapter book that Margaux has allowed me to read<br/>
to her.  It isn&#39;t a kid&#39;s book though.<br/>
<br/>
I read several things also referencing European cultures, in general<br/>
co-sleep, at least with babies and young children, and that is way more<br/>
common than in the US.  I can&#39;t tell you wether this is true or not,<br/>
just anecdotal, from stuff I was reading.<br/>

although when he would stay with his mother, he and his brother always<br/>

bedroom for her...it&#39;s her playroom. <br/>

However, when his dad comes to visit next week I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll get lots<br/>

Overall, in France it depends upon your culture. There are a lot of<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; In families with money and &quot;houses&quot; (as opposed to cottages or  <br/>
&gt; hovels), there was a nurse hired to watch the children at night and  <br/>
&gt; she slept with them, or if the family was rich there might be one  <br/>
&gt; nurse for each child.  This is still true in some wealthy families  <br/>
&gt; with  nannies--maybe not in the same bed, but the one to get up at  <br/>
&gt; night if a baby cries.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Older kids slept with other older kids.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve read that in inns and pubs, in the 19th century and before,  <br/>
&gt; sometimes paying to stay the night involved sharing a bed with a  <br/>
&gt; stranger.  So two  men who didn&#39;t even know each other might be in  <br/>

Identifying with a group is a big part of trends and decisionmaking.<br/>
<br/>
As I understand a general trend, in the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s many African  <br/>
American families couldn&#39;t afford all the glass bottles and formula  <br/>
and sterilization equipment, and so they breastfed from necessity,  <br/>
and when lots of them could afford formula, they by god WANTED it,  <br/>
regardless of the fact that research and trends had gone the other  <br/>
way by the 1980&#39;s.  And some conservative families will opt not to do  <br/>
something simply because a group they don&#39;t like IS doing it, and  <br/>
they don&#39;t want to be painted with the whatever-brush.<br/>
<br/>
So if people&#39;s kids don&#39;t have their own bedrooms, they aren&#39;t using  <br/>

<br/>
&quot;Until the 19th century overlaying was the only explanation of sudden and<br/>
unexpected death in infancy, and mentioned both in Roman records and in<br/>
medical and legal literature of the 12th and 13th centuries. The laws of the<br/>
church influenced secular legislation during the middle ages with defined<br/>
measures of punishment. During the 17th century publications appeared<br/>
warning against smothering of infants. Case reports similar to modern<br/>
reports were also given. Two textbooks discussing the existing knowledge of<br/>
prevention of overlaying and smothering of sucklings were published towards<br/>
the end of the 18th century.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Then it seems like there were some actual infanticide laws and such underway<br/>
during the early 17th century too.<br/>

pretty horrific, so brace yourself if you need to:<br/>

Local Population Studies, xv (1975). Regina Schulte&#39;s work on late<br/>
eighteenth-century and early nineteenth-century Bavaria roots infanticide<br/>
firmly in the context of farm servants&#39; everyday working lives: Regina<br/>
Schulte, The Village in Gurt: Arson, Infanticide and Poaching in the Court<br/>
Records of Upper Bavaria, 1848-1910, trans. Barrie Selman (Cambridge, 1994),<br/>
87-118. Many of the circumstances typical to early modern cases are<br/>
discussed in R. W. Malcolmson, `Infanticide in the Eighteenth Century&#39;, in<br/>
J. S. Cockburn (ed.), Crime in England, 1500-1800 (Princeton, 1977).<br/>
<br/>
(5) The surviving examinations are by no means a complete record of all<br/>
prosecutions. Indictment files which survive usually contain at least<br/>
another 25 per cent of cases. For the frequency of cases in<br/>
seventeenth-century England, see P. E. Hoffer and N. E. H. Hull, Murdering<br/>
Mothers: Infanticide in England and New England, 1558-1803 (New York and<br/>
London, 1981), 21-4; Wrightson, `Infanticide in Earlier Seventeenth-Century<br/>
England&#39;; Garthine Walker, `Gender, Crime and Social Order in Early Modern<br/>
Cheshire&#39; (Univ. of Liverpool Ph.D. thesis, 1994), 126-7. On the debated<br/>
incidence of neonatal infanticide, see also J. S. Cockburn, `The Nature and<br/>
Incidence of Crime in England, 1559-1625: A Preliminary Survey&#39;, in Cockburn<br/>
(ed.), Crime in England, 1500-1800, 58; Angus McLaren, Reproductive Rituals:<br/>
The Perception of Fertility in England from the Sixteenth Century to the<br/>
Nineteenth Century (London, 1984), 129-35.<br/>
<br/>
(6) The link between secret pregnancies and infanticide had been made<br/>
explicit by the statute of 1624, which made the concealment of an infant&#39;s<br/>
death the essence of the crime; at least some commentators saw the failure<br/>
to engage help in labour as evidence of guilty intent: Jackson, New-Born<br/>
Child Murder, 32.<br/>
<br/>
(7) Although `the rising of the apron&#39; was a well-established metaphor for<br/>
pregnancy and the stomachs of women suspected of pregnancy were certainly<br/>
watched by neighbours, clothing seems both to have disguised pregnancy to<br/>
some extent and to have made stomachs more difficult of access than breasts.<br/>
It also seems that, here, touching the breasts of a woman who might be<br/>
pregnant was culturally more acceptable than touching her stomach; early<br/>
modern women were also likely to gain less weight than modern women and the<br/>
weight gain of pregnancy might have remained unnoticed for longer.<br/>
<br/>
(8) Since at least some people expected milk to be present in the breasts<br/>
from around the fourth month of pregnancy, the test served to check for a<br/>
current pregnancy as well as a recent birth or miscarriage: Audrey Eccles,<br/>
Obstetrics and Gynaecology in Tudor and Stuart England (London, 1982), 153.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-853528678">Thanks Schyler!  That was really cool to read!  I really liked the<br/>
portion about how the different cultures inherently view the infant<br/>
child.  I can totally see that, and in fact, when Chamille was very<br/>
little, without even realizing it, I held such beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
Even though Chamille slept with us on and off for most of her young<br/>
life, I clearly held the view that independence was a good thing and<br/>
something that should be upheld.  Of course, it helped immensly that she<br/>
was a very independent kiddo and a very solid sleeper.  I used to lay<br/>
down with her or hold her hand until she fell asleep, but I never<br/>
question the need for her to be in her own bed or not.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, I never questioned our sleeping arrangements until Margaux was<br/>
born and absolutely would NOT sleep alone for longer than 10 min,<br/>
literally!<br/>
<br/>
Since Margaux needed to sleep at times during the day, the only way it<br/>
would happen was to cradle her in my arms, so thank goodness for the<br/>
internet and unschooling.com, so I could actually do something while she<br/>
slept in my arms, and wow, I actually became a better mother because of<br/>
it all!<br/>
<br/>
At night time, I&#39;d lay with Margaux, nurse her to sleep and put on the<br/>
jazz station on the radio.  Once she was good and asleep, I&#39;d get up to<br/>
do other stuff before coming to bed, if the radio was loud and big band<br/>
enough, she&#39;d stay asleep for long enough for me to wash some dishes or<br/>
something, if it moved on to light soft jazz, she&#39;d wake up and I&#39;d have<br/>
to go to bed for the night.</div>

about studies showing that children do not respond to home fire alarms <br/>
until some time after the age of 12 or so...and they had invented a <br/>
smoker detector that sounded out a recording of the mothers voice <br/>

When I was in labor with my fourth child I went down to the living room <br/>
to rest on the couch, which I found more comfortable... I left my then <br/>
4 year old son in bed with my husband...my son started in soon after <br/>
that with a severe case of croup...my husband slept through it...by the <br/>
time I heard him and made it up stairs. he was too far along, blue <br/>
lips, panicky...we had to rush him to the E.R. andonce there my labor <br/>
ground to a halt and didn&#39;t resume for two days!  I like my kids near <br/>
by to hear them if they&#39;re sick or hurt etc...Beverly</div>

 </span></blockquote>We recently moved into two bedrooms from on, with the two older <br/>
children upstairs and my husband and me and the two babies downstairs. <br/>
I much rather would have all of us upstairs but the other room will <br/>
only allow a twin-size bed. Many nights the older kids sleep with us <br/>
on the floor beside our beds. I sleep better when they do. (The only <br/>
reason we switched it up was that the older ones were expressing a <br/>
desire for a place of their own to hang out in and have toys <br/>
in-assessable from the little ones.)<br/>
<br/>
But I saw that story about fire alarms on TV, and the parents were <br/>
shocked that the kids slept through several hours of the alarms, high-<br/>
pitched, going off. I wasn&#39;t surprised at all. I was more surprised <br/>
that these parents had formerly depended on the children getting <br/>
themselves out of bed when the alarms goes off. I sleep much better at <br/>
night when I can hear each person in the room breathing.<br/>
<br/>
For a very brief period, when my oldest was just 2, and my son was an <br/>
infant, we had put my daughter in her own room. Two days later she <br/>
threw up for the first time, and I didn&#39;t realize it as vomit until I <br/>
came to check on her for what I thought was a cough. At that point, I <br/>
knew she&#39;d probably throw up again, and so we brought her back to our <br/>
room so I could hear when it happened to help her, and we never looked <br/>
back until now. <br/>
<br/>
I think the only reason they do okay on the nights they sleep away <br/>
from us is that they have each other. And I still have the monitor <br/>
cranked all the way up...if there was a way to quickly make another <br/>
room down here or up there, I&#39;d do it in a heartbeat.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1754969788">I have heard my mother brag over and over again over the years that<br/>
there were only two times that she has ever slept with me. Once when I<br/>
was 20 and we were traveling together in Ecuador and I got the stomach<br/>
flu in the middle of the night and was violently shaking all by<br/>
myself. My parents were in the room next door and I knocked and asked<br/>
for help. My mom held me and helped me warm up and get through the night. <br/>
<br/>
The other time was when I was 19 and having a mental breakdown while<br/>
at college. My roommates had called my folks to tell them I was acting<br/>
funny. I was totally out of it and she came up to fly me home and to<br/>
the doctor. The night she came to get me she shared my bed with me. <br/>
<br/>
I am working hard to have a mature relationship with my mother and<br/>
take responsibility for my life and my relationships. But when I think<br/>
about those times I have heard her tell that story of us sleeping<br/>
together only in totally emergency situations it breaks my heart.<br/>
<br/>
My mom has always been proud of the fact that her kids have always<br/>
been very &quot;independent&quot; and she has worked hard to make that so. Now,<br/>
of four kids, I am the only one that she is somewhat close to. And I<br/>
live in Ecuador! Her other children live a lot closer, but resist an<br/>
intimate relationship with her. Could it be related to her resistance<br/>
to share intimate space with us when we were younger? I think so.  <br/>
<br/>
Imagine her dismay when she saw the two double beds pushed together in<br/>
our house! Imagine my joy when I realized I could do it different and<br/>
have a different relationship with my children!<br/>
