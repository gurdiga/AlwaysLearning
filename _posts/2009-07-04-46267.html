<div id="ygrps-yiv-792036457">Reading the news this morning there is a Little House on the Prarie reference in a very British article: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/wimbledon/5733621/Wimbledon-2009-Andy-Roddick-defeats-Andy-Murray-to-set-up-Roger-Federer-clash.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/wimbledon/5733621/Wimbledon-2009-Andy-Roddick-defeats-Andy-Murray-to-set-up-Roger-Federer-clash.html</a><br/>
<br/>
&quot;Murray occasionally biffed and bashed his hand against his strings  when events turned against him. Nothing much worked out for him on his first  appearance in a Wimbledon semi-final – he was falsely accused of swearing by  the umpire, and received a warning for “an audible obscenity”, even though  the 22 year-old’s language was as clean as the dialogue from Little House on  the Prairie.<br/>
&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It would suggest that at least the Michael Landon version of the midwest has made his mark on the British reference base. <br/>
