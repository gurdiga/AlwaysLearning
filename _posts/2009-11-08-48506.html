<div id="ygrps-yiv-1792841363">This was posted to the chatnote list.  I&#39;ve brought it here and will  <br/>
copy the author on responses until she joins here.<br/>
<br/>
I am new to homeschooling and after short CAVA experience quickly  <br/>
moved to<br/>
unschooling my kids (6 and 17, plus little 2 :) once I found out that  <br/>
there are<br/>
other legal ways for schooling in this country and state.<br/>
We&#39;re taking it slow now and licking our wounds. I&#39;m still educating  <br/>
myself and<br/>
finding more support.<br/>
<br/>
I am very happy to find Sandra Dodd who supports my understanding of  <br/>
parenting<br/>
and schooling my kids! Through my parenting years I&#39;ve been criticized  <br/>
and put<br/>
down by my in-laws and even by my husband about my parenting ways (I&#39;m  <br/>
from<br/>
Europe and my parents and siblings and friends are far!)... but I&#39;ve  <br/>
stood<br/>
strong most of the times and am very happy to find out that there ARE  <br/>
people<br/>
like me!<br/>
<br/>
My husband is starting to see that there might be a point to my gentle  <br/>
and<br/>
loving approach since all other has failed. He still needs a lot of  <br/>
time, I&#39;m<br/>
gently surrounding him with info about unshooling and about parenting  <br/>
approach<br/>
very foreign and strange to him.<br/>
<br/>
Next step will be to order your book, Sandra! I&#39;ve been just  <br/>
overwhelmed with<br/>
all the good info and support on your page, I think that the book  <br/>
would be<br/>
easier to handle. I just need to convince my husband first about the  <br/>
necessity<br/>
of this expense during these financially tough times.<br/>
<br/>
There are many-many questions that I still have, but I&#39;ll start off  <br/>
with most<br/>
pressing and current one:<br/>
<br/>
We go to the &quot;Estonian House&quot; every other weekend to learn my native  <br/>
language<br/>
and to connect with other Estonians. It is very mellow and easy  <br/>
environment and<br/>
my kids love it!<br/>
<br/>
Right now we&#39;re preparing for the Christmas party with songs to sing  <br/>
and dances<br/>
to dance. All is good and fun but the dance part... The instructing  <br/>
lady is a<br/>
very sweet woman with an autistic kid and mom who is struggling with  <br/>
cancer. She<br/>
is wonderful to be around and the kids seem to like her too for now.<br/>
But her ways to instruct are very rigid and stern. She does not yell  <br/>
or raise<br/>
voice, but sternly stops the whole dance and scolds once one of the  <br/>
kids is<br/>
making a mistake or getting a little giddy or bouncy. My poor Tom (6  <br/>
yr old)! He<br/>
is a tall kid looking older for his age and he&#39;s very lively. He  <br/>
learns best<br/>
when moving too. Hyperactive and disruptive, they called him in  <br/>
kindergarten :(<br/>
where he developed obsessive-compulsive disorder signs when under  <br/>
stress and not<br/>
able to explain his emotions.<br/>
Tommy is still excited to go and dance with the group but I fear of  <br/>
the moment<br/>
when he&#39;ll come crying and never wanting to do it again.<br/>
What to do? She seems so hard for me to approach about this issue  <br/>
especially<br/>
that she is volunteering to do this. And pulling my kid out of the  <br/>
dance would<br/>
brake his heart. I thought teaching him the dance by myself to prepare  <br/>
him, but<br/>
it&#39;s kind of hard without the group ... and that still doesn&#39;t change  <br/>
who he is<br/>
while dancing, that happy goof :)<br/>
<br/>
My teen is in a similar situation where his counselor is signing  <br/>
&quot;homework&quot; to<br/>
him that my kid is not too excited to do. The counselor knows that I&#39;m<br/>
homeschooling now and wants to see the academics to be involved to get  <br/>
him out<br/>
of being &quot;bored&quot;, while my teen is far from ready to do assignments.<br/>
<br/>
Shoot me with any ideas or advice, please.<br/>

&quot;homework&quot; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Counselor?<br/>
<br/>
What does that mean?<br/>
<br/>
I tend to want to keep people who actively undermine our unschooling out of <br/>
our life. Jayn historically reacts poorly to people with a teaching agenda.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Tommy is still excited to go and dance with the group but I fear of <br/>
the moment<br/>
when he&#39;ll come crying and never wanting to do it again. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My daughter (10) has been attending a dance class that she loves since she <br/>
was 3. The dance teacher is very gentle with the foundation of her classes <br/>
being supporting children&#39;s love of movement and creative expression, but <br/>
does have rules in class. Jayn has been able to adapt herself to the rules <br/>
and was willing to put up with a whole year of a couple of not very nice <br/>
girls in the class one year in order to continue dancing.<br/>
<br/>
Now a different girl is returning that Jayn is sorry to see come back <br/>
because from Jayn&#39;s POV she slows down the whole class. Jayn considers the <br/>
other girl to be inattentive, and unenthusiastic. Before when she is in the <br/>
class, instructions and choreography had to be repeated - because the girl <br/>
seemed never to be watching or listening. They had to repeat steps until she <br/>
got them. Jayn wonders if the girl really wants to be there, or if her Mom <br/>
is pushing her to go for some reason of her own.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn is considering leaving, but after a lot of crying and expressing to me <br/>
the other night, decided to give it a try and see what happens. Sometimes <br/>
going through a period of crying and sadness is needed to process feelings. <br/>
Crying, especially supported crying, doesn&#39;t always mean that the child will <br/>
stop, but may be the mechanism that releases enough stress to allow the <br/>
child to continue.<br/>
<br/>
Nor does stopping have to mean forever. Sometimes it just means a short <br/>
break until the maturity level comes up to such a point where the hoops are <br/>
worth jumping through for the child.<br/>
<br/>
Please try to let go of your fear of your child&#39;s strong emotions. Just as <br/>
peaceful doesn&#39;t always mean quiet, happiness doesn&#39;t always mean never <br/>
crying.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-976135485">Thank you, Robyn, for your response to my post. <br/>
<br/>
I apologise for not describing the situations in full detail - didn&#39;t want to write too long of a story. Plus I&#39;m a newbie to all of this and English being my second language.<br/>
<br/>
My teen had an IEP in public school and he saw a counselor and psychiatrist in a regular basis. He has no disabilities, but low self esteem and serious depression over years. It did not get better when we enrolled with CAVA. Then I happened to meet a seasoned homeschooler who recommended to take him out of CAVA and start homeschooling by myself. I didn&#39;t know before that it was possible or I&#39;d done it years ago!<br/>
He still is going to the counselor for now until I know for sure that it&#39;s best to stop the service.<br/>
<br/>
Robyn, when you wrote &quot;I tend to want to keep people who actively undermine our unschooling out of our life. Jayn historically reacts poorly to people with a teaching agenda.&quot; I&#39;m not sure if I understood you message right, but it felt like stab. I do not undermine unschooling, or I&#39;d not involve myself and my kids in it. If I sound incompetent about something you are probably right. But throw me a bone here, educate me. I thought that&#39;s what this place is for?<br/>
<br/>
As for my younger son I&#39;m trying to message him also that it is fine to be natural, be himself. We&#39;re freshly weaning from strict rules and criticism.<br/>
And the dance they do is just very simple cute part of the Christmas party for all the kids to participate in - its more like a dance-game to a national folk music. they hold hands, twirl around, walk in to a tight circle and out again ... It&#39;s far from serious dance class, like you describe your daughter is doing. My son has never expressed any interest in more serious dancing, doesn&#39;t seem to be in him (while my daughter is just 2 but will probably follow the same path as your daughter, I can see). He is more of a sports and games boy-boy. He just wants to be in the group and have fun, like I see is totally appropriate in this low-key home-like place and situation. And the kids are from 6 to about 15 yrs old, girls and boys with different skills. They will not even wear special outfits for the event.  <br/>
The &quot;instructor&quot; just seems to just take it a little too seriously. <br/>
<br/>
Correct me if I understood your response wrong. And in that case my deepest apologies.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Enel<br/>

If your son doesn&#39;t mind, then it doesn&#39;t matter.  If he does, then  <br/>
that instruction and seriousness could potentially undermine  <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If your other son&#39;s counselor is giving homework, I&#39;m guessing it  <br/>
bothers you more than your son.  But same there; if it doesn&#39;t bother  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks Lyla, I totally meant the counsellor sounded like he was undermining <br/>
Enel&#39;s brand new unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard enough to deschool yourself and get to happy unschooling without <br/>
someone from the pre-unschooling days actively trying to drag you back to a <br/>
schooly mindset. Is it academic type homework or is it therapy exercises?<br/>
<br/>
I thought I read that your son was not keen on doing the homework. That is <br/>
the important issue. Maybe you could talk to the counsellor about that.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easy when you have been in a schooling situation for a number of years, <br/>
to start believing that experts have more knowledge than your own heart, and <br/>
your child&#39;s self-knowledge - that they must and should be deferred to in <br/>
all things. One of the big parts of home schooling, even unschooling, is the <br/>
choice to renounce the assumed superiority of experts in our lives and take <br/>
responsibility ourselves for our choices and decisions.<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I are responsible for our daughter&#39;s education. We are not <br/>
pushing off the responsibility to schools and teachers. Nor are we blaming <br/>
all kinds of external forces for anything that might go wrong either. It is <br/>
our responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
Becoming your child&#39;s advocate, when school culture has spent many years <br/>
pushing you to be a school collaborator at best, silent witness at least, <br/>
and finding the courage to stand up to experts (like the counsellor) about <br/>
your child&#39;s happiness, is harder than going with the familiar flow.  You <br/>
have taken the first steps by renouncing CAVA (whatever that is).<br/>
<br/>
I think you should consider whether or not the emotional problems such as <br/>
depression that your son was suffering might have been all bound up in, <br/>
maybe even caused by, his school experience. *If so* keeping a big part of <br/>
that schooly experience in his life, fueled by the counsellor, might be <br/>
counterproductive.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if it would be possible to find a new therapist who is more <br/>
understanding and informed about alternative education and natural learning.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; It&#39;s far from serious dance class, like you describe your daughter is <br/>
doing. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Evidently I didn&#39;t make my daughter&#39;s dance class description very clear <br/>
either. The class itself is certainly not &quot;serious dance&quot; - it is creative <br/>
movement for self expression and in the younger years it is pretty much ring <br/>
around the rosie to music. There is a lot of play and improvisation. But <br/>
they do all learn a dance for the family recital. Often the kids help with <br/>
the choreography.<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s not the point I was making. I wasn&#39;t making a judgement of <br/>
whether the class facilitator was too serious or the class too structured. <br/>
You younger son is enjoying himself for now, isn&#39;t he?<br/>
<br/>
The point I was making was to not be afraid of tears because sometimes they <br/>
are part of the necessary process of growth and thinking through choices.<br/>
<br/>
The goal is to be a safe place (the safest place) for your kids to talk over <br/>
their quandraries and difficult decisions. Sometimes that means being <br/>
willing to listen while they cry about them.<br/>

questions, though, so it can feel to the original poster like it is ALL <br/>
about them and only them. It helps if people remember that we don&#39;t know <br/>
their entire back story and so our discussion is based on how we see the <br/>
general principles of unschooling applying to what they&#39;ve presented. <br/>
Also, what someone presents is very often not just what they think they <br/>
are telling us, but we are responding, also, to the &quot;way&quot; they describe it.<br/>
<br/>
A really good way to &quot;take&quot; the advice given on this list is to try to <br/>
figure out what, in your own post, led someone to think that their <br/>
response would be helpful. Wonder about that - go back and read your own <br/>
posts from that perspective. Ask yourself if there IS a way that advice <br/>
could be useful. Lower your defenses - it really isn&#39;t personal and is <br/>
only about you to the extent that YOU recognize it as being about you.<br/>
