<div id="ygrps-yiv-1193397231">I just wanted to share a quick clip of my 15 year old unschooling  <br/>
(well, he did have a brief stint at Summerhill School 5 years ago)  <br/>
son, singing at his (first ever) gig the other night.  His friends  <br/>
(many of them adults) came to support him and his unschooled buddy  <br/>
Joe.  They rehearsed just once, and when I inquired about that, they  <br/>
assured me it was plenty :) they plan to keep playing around town.<br/>
