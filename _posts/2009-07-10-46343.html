<div id="ygrps-yiv-1306706936">I&#39;ve had a request for a topic chat.   This will probably be saved and  <br/>
added to the webpage, because there&#39;s not much about these things  <br/>
there right now.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
Sandra<br/>

<br/>
What about young children who are expressing themselves physically by  <br/>
pushing or hitting or biting?  Many of us have seen it, felt it,  <br/>
helped kids through.  If you have any ideas, please come and share.   <br/>
If you want to bring links to things you&#39;ve already written or that  <br/>
you&#39;ve read and liked, I&#39;ll collect and save them so they&#39;ll be  <br/>
available in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Please forward this on to anyone you think might need it or be  <br/>
particularly good at helping others about it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
