<div id="ygrps-yiv-433480304">I agree...<br/>
<br/>
People do have alot of time on their hands..<br/>
<br/>
I just happened to have the TV on the other night and Jay Leno was on....<br/>
In his opening monolog (sp?)<br/>
He was talking about these people that were complaining about a Denny&#39;s <br/>
commerical...<br/>
Because............ Miss Piggy was eating sausage and they said that it was <br/>
promoting pig cannablisim....<br/>
Jay said...uhh ...it&#39;s a puppet...heeeeelllllloooooooooooo<br/>
<br/>
Today,  hubby had us on hold while he tended to a customer on the train <br/>
right......<br/>
This guy comes down and asks if he has  such and such a sandwich....my <br/>
husband tells him what we have is own the menu.... he goes you guys have a <br/>
menu.....my hubby goes naw....we just hand them out!<br/>
I was laughing so hard... Cause guys...... the menu is so large just like you <br/>
go into any place to order food at a counter...they have it even on the sides <br/>
of the wall while you are standing in line.......they even have it long <br/>
before you get to the counter......<br/>
Then I had this lady who had to give me a rain check for some water <br/>
right....... I told her what I wanted, she gets the sale paper, looks at them <br/>
item and writes down the item on the rain check......well I get home and look <br/>
at it....it was the wrong brand of water..... It was suppose to be Ice <br/>
Mountain not Hinckley and Schmitt.<br/>
Then one of my kids friends came over (she&#39;s 14) ......I have a no solicitors <br/>
sign on cause it was just so bad this summer (of course girl scouts are ok..I <br/>
want some cookies), but she asked what it was....My kids said...... NOOOOOO <br/>
SOLICITORSSSSSS, she said ok....but what does it mean?<br/>
<br/>
I would just like know how stupid are people going to get.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Many Arabs have a hard time actually defining their own race. My seniors<br/>
were doing research projects and some put questions such as How do you<br/>
define yourself ... Caucasion, Asian .... They realized that their fellow<br/>
Arabs usually couldn&#39;t self-define and usually put &quot;other.&quot; It was<br/>
interesting for me to see but more so for the students as it made them<br/>
start thinking more deeply about the issue.<br/>

In an acting class I was in recently, a few words came up in various <br/>

someone, and they explained. And now I know the word. Simple as that. <br/>

didn&#39;t NOT ask because of a fear of being made to look stupid!<br/>

<br/>
I agree that it was great she asked. I have had times myself when I have<br/>
been a little shaky on a definition but have to say I usually won&#39;t ask --<br/>
just battle on. I have bluffed my way out of pronunciation mistakes by<br/>
saying &quot;well we pronounce it that way in England.&quot; This of course with no<br/>
idea whether I&#39;m right or not:)<br/>
