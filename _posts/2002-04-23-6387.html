<div id="ygrps-yiv-1583523767">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; (although the 6 year old wants to be a superhero! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My son Shawn, now 27, used to wear his cape very often, and climb up the <br/>
ladder of the slide on the swing set (it went up to the bar where the swings <br/>
attach), turn away from the slide and jump to the ground.  He would sing <br/>
&quot;Johnny Phiffer is a hero--&quot; as he jumped.  None of us knew who Johnny was.<br/>
<br/>
As he grew he flew around on skateboard ramps, then did gymnastics, and <br/>
finally landed into springboard/tower diving.  When he took up juggling <br/>
(between skateboarding and gym.), I thought he&#39;d be grounded.  But no.  He <br/>
taught himself to ride a unicycle, and then got a 6&#39; tall one to ride while <br/>
he juggled.  He just placed first at Nationals for Division 2 schools on the <br/>
springboard (Can I brag?  He not only won but did so by over 100 points- he <br/>
was totally amazed).  BUT, his real love is the tower (30&#39; tall - on which he <br/>
is now concentrating for the Senior Nationals).  So you see, even tho he <br/>
didn&#39;t become a super hero, he is still flying.<br/>
<br/>
Well, he&#39;s not flying this week, he&#39;s a king in a Shakespearean play that <br/>
opens tomorrow at his college in Clarion, PA (sure wish I could be there - <br/>
I&#39;m in CA).  He&#39;s majoring in drama.  He went to ps for kindergarden - then <br/>
college.<br/>
