<div id="ygrps-yiv-892239450">Same here, Laura, I often wonder if I would have done fine with a Vbac.  My<br/>
first was an emergency c, as I was in a car accident and Haley had gripped<br/>
her cord so tightly she had very little oxygen, they waited and hoped I<br/>
would go into labor because her due date was just 5 days away.  They did a<br/>
vertical cut.  With my next child my blood pressure spiked up and down, I<br/>
had 2 weeks till the due date and this doctor went in a panic on one of my<br/>
visits and decided to do a c the next morning.  He said he was afraid my bp<br/>
would spike too high during labor and cause a stroke?.. I dont&#39; know if any<br/>
of this would have happened.. My third child I had another new doctor who<br/>
gave me a choice, but I was once again gullable and let my mom talk me into<br/>
another c-section because she was nervous, plus I already knew what to<br/>
expect :(.  With my 4th child, my doctor said the chance was too high that<br/>
my baby would drown in blood if my uterus ripped while in labor, so I never<br/>
got to experience even labor.  All I can do is share my experiences.  I had<br/>
all c&#39;s, but if I could go back I would have tried vbacs with the last 3. <br/>
But I do have 4 very healthy children, so at this point it doesn&#39;t really<br/>
matter to me how they got here. :-) .  I couldn&#39;t tell you which way to go<br/>
with it as it is such a personal thing/feeling/instinct.  And ask around<br/>
some more?<br/>

*************I wanted a vbac with my last two but doctors said no. I do<br/>
wonder if I would <br/>
have done ok with one. My first was 7.5 almost c-section and the last two <br/>
where c&#39;s. They where 10-12 and 9-4. We have been trying for another and I <br/>
would like to go vbac. Doctors keep telling me that if I go Vbac it could <br/>
kill me or the baby. Is this true?<br/>

about all aspects of this road we are travelling with our children is<br/>
surely a wonderful gift -- be thankful you have been privvy to our sharing:)<br/>
<br/>
I for one have enjoyed the discussion but I think it has probably run it&#39;s<br/>
course now just as all the other bits and bobs of life with children also<br/>
have.<br/>
