<div id="ygrps-yiv-912192968">Rachel, I too am an unschooling mom to 4 (4 sons to be exact!) and I too have battled my schooled mind.  It&#39;s hard.  It&#39;s what we learned but I find the more I let go the happier we are.  I create opportunities for them like visiting museums, libraries, the grocery store, etc and voila, they do the rest!  Actually, many times I don&#39;t create opportunities for them but let them find their own opportunities and viola, the do the rest!  <br/>
<br/>
I find that all I have to do is look a a couple examples of schooled kids (my niece, my nephew, etc) and I&#39;m convinced.  My nephew, could read at 3 years, could tell you what flag belonged to what country just by looking, etc.  Now - getting a &quot;C&quot; in reading (how is that even possible???) and HATES it.  They have totally stolen his soul, okay, a little dramatic, but not really.  He&#39;s a shell of a kid who used to love finding out things.  NOw he just plays the game.  It&#39;s sad.<br/>
<br/>
Leave them along (not literally).  Don&#39;t push, just watch and love and care and find your own interests.  Be an example of life-long learning.  Teach yourself to do something new and let them watch you.  Find the value in everything they do and let that be your ruler instead of what some &quot;suit&quot; has deemed is the way.  Stop looking to the school system for your ruler.  <br/>
<br/>
My boys know more about chickens from taking care of them than most people.  Is there a curriculum for that?  I&#39;m sure someone who wanted to make a buck could develop one but then they wouldn&#39;t be interested!  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;m sounding preachy.  This is very important to me and my family and I completely understand your strugge.  I&#39;ve been there!<br/>

<br/>
Good advice.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Don&#39;t push, just watch and love and care and find your own  <br/>
interests. Be an example of life-long learning. Teach yourself to do  <br/>
something new and let them watch you. -=-<br/>
<br/>
A quibble:<br/>
Don&#39;t &quot;teach yourself.&quot;<br/>
Learn.<br/>
<br/>
While you&#39;re learning things, feel how that feels, and realize that  <br/>
you&#39;re LEARNING without being taught, and that will help you have  <br/>
faith in unschooling.  If you think you&#39;re teaching (even teaching  <br/>
yourself) it will be a step in the wrong direction.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/wordswords">http://sandradodd.com/wordswords</a><br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really important to hear yourself everything you write (or  <br/>
think) &quot;teach.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

If you&#39;re still thinking of &quot;teaching&quot; you&#39;re still too close to  <br/>
schooling.<br/>
Step away from the school in your mind.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2068664746">Thanks Jodi-<br/>
  Knowing their are others out there is always so encouraging! We try to utilize every opportunity for learning, unfortunately we are unable to get out as much as I would like. My DH and I share 1 car and $$ is very, very tight. Sometimes I feel so guilty I can&#39;t give the kids more, but I know just providing a loving, safe home is enough (has to be) right now. We are so set against ever putting the children in school, but the idea still crosses my mind when i&#39;m feeling smothered and the kids are bored. I could just use lots of encouragement and support. Thanks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1258628700">Hi, again, Rachel (and all).  First of all, Sandra, thank you for your words about unschooling and replacing &quot;teaching&quot; with &quot;learning&quot;.  I think people might think it&#39;s semantics but I think you are right.  I do still struggle on some days with &quot;what are my boys DOING&quot; and because this life is soooo intangible, it&#39;s sometimes tough.  I know it&#39;s the right way for us, however, and I see my boys thrive when I relax and smile.<br/>
<br/>
Rachel, I get ya!  It can be really tough sometimes especially when you are trying to do something that most don&#39;t really understand.  ARe you in a town or country?  My boys and I spend tons of time at the local libraries.  You don&#39;t have to &quot;give&quot; them anything - what do you mean?  Stuff?  Really, I find the more of me I give them, the happier they are.  They love it when I do anything with them - play Gamecube, watch a movie, read a book, play with playdoh, sled, cut paper, look at pictures, and on and on.  Are you sure they are bored or are you?  I sometimes feel like &quot;geez, I just need to GET SOMETHING DONE&quot; or &quot;Do something for myself&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
I think Sandra wrote an article about boredom that I read a while ago and found helpful.  Maybe she can post the link to it.  I have a friend who says &quot;boredom is the font from which all creativity flows&quot;.  I believe it.  When my boys (usually just my oldest son, 11 years) says he&#39;s bored, we sit for a bit and think about things we&#39;d like to do or that he can do.  I will sometimes come up with suggestions but usually he&#39;ll just talk with me for a while and then go off to do something.  I know some people will say &quot;find something to do or I&#39;ll give you something&quot; (in a very threatening voice) but I know how it feels to be bored and that&#39;s the last thing I want someone to say to me!  <br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s you who&#39;s bored, I get that too.  I have a tough time &quot;being still&quot;.  I&#39;m a &quot;doing something all the time&quot; person and when I don&#39;t ahve anything to do or don&#39;t want to do anything I have to do, it&#39;s hard.  Most days I will spend some &quot;floor time&quot; with my boys which might include putting together a puzzle or reading or playing Legos or whatever they are doing.  That feeling goes away and we are all much happier.<br/>
<br/>
Giving them things and fretting about money is still using someone else&#39;s ruler to judge your life.  Don&#39;t go there!  It will only lead to feelings of failure.  Look at what you can give them, more than most!  Trust yourself and trust your kids!<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2002505063">Jodi, <br/>
  you are so kind to take your precious time to &quot;minister&quot; to me. It is me that gets bored- you&#39;re right. and i do have a difficult time being still and feelings of unproductivity overwhelm me at times- that probably stems from my very tumultuous life growing up. the feelings of guilt are at times deafening and I want to scream! I am too hard on my self (dh says) it&#39;s true. It is such an intangible thing! Perhaps i am just too selfish. Wow, who would have ever thought that we could get so much out of this experience! I&#39;m being stretched daily and sometimes it hurts... y&#39;know? what a blessing though to have the opportunity to grow and blossom while truly &quot;knowing&quot; the people we brought into this world. sometimes it just amazes me how people can travail and birth these miracles (opportunities) and then so quickly disregard their importance in their own lives and never truly enjoy the blessing of their relationship with one another. the 5 of us were  having lunch yesterday and<br/>
 we were all talking and having a nice time and all of he sudden it hit me- I like these people and i&#39;m so glad to be with them all day. and how sad it would be if we weren&#39;t! if they went off everyday i would not know them and they would not know me and they wouldn&#39;t know one another. It encouraged me and made me stop and thank God for His goodness poured all over me! Thanks again, jodi and all of you who share with me in this great and wonderful undertaking!<br/>
