something along the lines of &quot;Four Courners&quot;, since I&#39;ll be importing from <br/>
all over the world (3 continents so far!), but again, not cuddly. :-(<br/>
My surname is Howard, so doesn&#39;t really lend itself to anything. Nappy Lady <br/>
is already gone, although someone has suggested that I could be the nappy <br/>
bag! lol<br/>
Thanks for all your suggestions so far.<br/>
