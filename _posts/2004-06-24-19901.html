I&#39;ve just come off no mail after an overseas trip. I&#39;m looking forward to some more of the inspiring encouragement I get from this list!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been asked to do an hour long unschooling workshop for our local homeschooling conference next month. There are very few unschooling families in the area, so most participants are going to be pretty ignorant of unschooling. I&#39;m fairly confident that I can put something interesting, informative and fun together, but I would really appreciate any tips, ideas or advice. Also if anyone has done this kind of thing, I&#39;d love to hear about how it went.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

You&#39;d be stealing from Sandra, but I LOVED her &quot;Connections&quot; talk at last  <br/>
year&#39;s Live and Learn Unschooling Conference. She handed out papers with two  <br/>
dots on them and had people &quot;connect the dots&quot;----BRILLIANT. And the resulting  <br/>
pieces of art----and some of them *were*----were great fun to look at.<br/>
 <br/>
Even neater was that Anne&#39;s talk was *also* about connections----totally  <br/>
unrelated and unplanned!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1646370398">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Trish and I&#39;m unschooling with my two daughters of 12 and 10.  I<br/>
live in the Far North (Kohukohu, Hokianga).  I&#39;m still working at becoming<br/>
an unschooler.  Dealing with my own doubts, etc.  I love the unschooling<br/>
yahoo group.<br/>
<br/>
Are you going to be at the conference in Whangarei at the end of July?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m keen to attend but I&#39;m unaware of dates and times.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you are in the North too and can fill me in.<br/>
<br/>
Warm Regards<br/>
<br/>
Trish Donk<br/>
