<div id="ygrps-yiv-1222656558">Holly expressed strong jealousy because someone she knows well has had a couple of cushy house-sitting jobs lately, and is caught up on season 5 of Breaking Bad, because of it.   We don&#39;t have cable, so our kids watch on Netflix, which only goes up to the season before.<br/>
<br/>
Because Holly has been on a bible quoting kick (looking things up, not knowing them already), I told her she should not covet her neighbor&#39;s ass.<br/>
<br/>
So I looked up the verse for the details in order (because the ass comes last) to read it to her in the King James version.   And there was commentary (Baptist style, quoting the New Testament for emphasis), and it talked about sinning in your heart.<br/>
<br/>
She said she shouldn&#39;t even thinking it?  And I gave her another quote about that, and told her that Jimmy Carter, when he was a very Baptist president, told a reporter that he had committed adultry in his heart, which made perfect sense to Baptists, but other people laughed at him. <br/>
<br/>
So I said that he was admitting to having *thought* about another woman, sexually. <br/>
<br/>
And Holly Dodd spake and said:  &quot;Nah, it probably means he saw Angelina Jolie in Beowulf.&quot;<br/>
