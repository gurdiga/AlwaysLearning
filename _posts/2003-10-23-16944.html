And whenever he has the opportunity, he will gorge himself on the foods that are<br/>
 being restricted at home.  He will not learn anything in the long run about<br/>
 making appropriate choices for himself.<br/>

<br/>
Great point Mary Ellen!<br/>
About people being more concerned about choice than health...hmmmphf!<br/>
We&#39;re concerned that lack of choice LEADS to health problems and eating disorders. Julie admitted NOT having free choice in her home. She said they are made to eat what they take.<br/>
I think that is part of the problem.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-964418538">We also do the pack in the nutrients.  Zach even requested a smoothie the<br/>
other day (made with homemade goat milk yogurt) with strawberries and honey.<br/>
I usually throw wheatgerm into things.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m beginning to think perhaps I was worrying more than necessary.  Kind of<br/>
like when your kid has a fever and by the time you get to the doctor its<br/>
98.6 .  Zach has been eating better since I posted this.  Still way more<br/>
sweets than I would eat but I don&#39;t care about that.  He is actually getting<br/>
a little nutrition.  They say in psychology that the mere act of stuying a<br/>
behavior causes it to change.  Perhaps Zach needed more attention.  I think<br/>
I can do that  :)<br/>
