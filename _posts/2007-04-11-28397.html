<div id="ygrps-yiv-193321963">That are more child friendly then audubon?  I&#39;m hoping to find a site<br/>
that has lots of pictures.  We have a new bird feeder in the back yard<br/>
and the kids (ages 7 and 4) are asking me about the birds... what kind<br/>
they are, what they eat, etc.   I, of course, have no clue!  ((bwg)) <br/>
My 4 year old is enjoying naming them himself..  so far we have<br/>
Sunshine and Planet Earth. <br/>
<br/>
I checked audubon&#39;s website but it seems to be more for the bird<br/>
enthusiast that has at least some knowledge of what they are looking<br/>
for.  <br/>
<br/>
I checked Google but didn&#39;t find anything that really tripped my<br/>
trigger so I thought I would ask for some recomendations here.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

It&#39;s sponsored by the National Wildlife Foundation.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not made for kids, exactly, but it has incredibly easy searchable  <br/>
field guides; I used it myself today to track down a bird that&#39;s been  <br/>
hanging around our feeder the last couple of days.  (If I found the  <br/>
right one, it&#39;s a vagrant from Louisiana - an Orchard Oriole.  San  <br/>
Diego is on a lot of migratory routes, so we get some interesting  <br/>
visitors!)  The site has guides for critters besides birds, too.<br/>
<br/>
Another site, though not specifically about birds, is National  <br/>
Geographic and it&#39;s kids site,<br/>

<br/>
cool stuff &lt;g&gt;  (A bit commercial, of course...)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-512633067">Try this excellent site:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/">http://www.birds.cornell.edu/</a>    click on the All About Birds link<br/>
<br/>
We also have a Smithsonian kid&#39;s field guide that&#39;s very good, not as  <br/>
overwhelming as a standard version.<br/>
