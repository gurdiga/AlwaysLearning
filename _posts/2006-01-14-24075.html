<div id="ygrps-yiv-1160571967"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;For this list, I&#39;m concerned only with what makes children&#39;s lives<br/>
&gt;easier, not what makes their mothers feel more important or martyrly<br/>
&gt;or special.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Many people have said when they moved their focus from their own<br/>
&gt;concerns and feelings onto their children&#39;s comfort and joy, there<br/>
&gt;was enough comfort and joy for the whole family and some to spread<br/>
&gt;around. In a mother-focussed home, unschooling won&#39;t work very well.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Labels go too far from about the time they&#39;re brought out and<br/>
&gt;examined. Let schools have them. We can live with our individual<br/>
&gt;children and help them have happy lives of learning and growth.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I did think we were talking about what makes a child&#39;s life easier, <br/>
not about mother&#39;s wanting to label their kids (I don&#39;t and didn&#39;t and <br/>
wasn&#39;t looking to ever labal my kids) or about mother&#39;s wanting to <br/>
feel better about themselves or whatever by labeling their kids.  Or <br/>
at least that&#39;s what I was trying to talk about.  Part of the <br/>
conversation and comments I made were from the perspective of talking <br/>
about myself, my own difficulties in different areas, so I think that <br/>
caused some confusion, because I wasn&#39;t always talking about my <br/>
children per se.  But in a sense I was talking about my kids too, and <br/>
what it might be like for them to interact with the world firsthand <br/>
based on what I know it&#39;s like for me to interact with the world <br/>
firsthand.  I was trying to use first hand specific examples and not <br/>
use generalities and vagueness, because I have heard Sandra ask many <br/>
times for specifics and actual experiences and not theories and <br/>
guesses and generalities.  I&#39;m sorry if I did wrong by doing so.<br/>
<br/>
This has been a really positive discussion overall I think, with a lot <br/>
of really good information and valid points made and lots to learn and <br/>
discuss.  I know there is lots for me to learn and consider.<br/>
