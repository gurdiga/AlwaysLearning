<div id="ygrps-yiv-850533369">I thought I&#39;d share this here. It made me feel really good <br/>
yesterday---and it&#39;s not so often that &quot;our&quot; parenting choices impress <br/>
others. Usually we&#39;re criticized for being &quot;indulgent&quot; or &quot;permissive&quot; <br/>
or something equally negative.<br/>
<br/>
Duncan and I (and the guide dog, Rotey) were eating lunch at a deli. A <br/>
man---he was young-ish---early-mid thirties?---sat down behind Duncan. <br/>
I noticed he was listening in on our conversation and looking over <br/>
every now and then.<br/>
<br/>
We ate, read Yu-Gi-Oh! cards, talked about the beach & the guide dogs, <br/>
shared pickles, wrapped a present for a friend&#39;s birthday party. I told <br/>
him how to spell &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; on the card.<br/>
<br/>
The fellow got up to leave but stopped by our table and said, &quot;I <br/>
couldn&#39;t help but notice....&quot;  Now---usually that means something about <br/>
the guide dog, so I was ready with guide dog talk.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But he said, &quot;You are really good with him.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I thanked him.<br/>
<br/>
He said, &quot;You don&#39;t see that very often.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I said, &quot;No, you don&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I just wanted to say something. Most parents don&#39;t treat their kids <br/>
like that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I said, &quot;Thank you for noticing and for commenting. It&#39;s always nice to <br/>
hear.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Duncan got a HUGE grin and kept that smile all afternoon! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I make a point of complimenting  moms who are sweet with their kids <br/>
when I see it too---it&#39;s just so rare. It&#39;s nice to be on the receiving <br/>
end of the compliment! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
