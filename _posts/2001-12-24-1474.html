<div id="ygrps-yiv-2010683158">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;When Casey was 2, we once had an interesting<br/>
conversation. She was pretty verbal early on, so you<br/>
could actually have conversations with her at 2. <br/>
Anyway, we were driving in the car once and she<br/>
started telling me about what life was like when she<br/>
was &quot;a little girl&quot;. She told me that when she <br/>
was a little girl everything was white (a snowy<br/>
place?), and there were no trees around. She described<br/>
the setting a little more and then told me <br/>
about her mother (!).<br/>
<br/>
She told me her mother died when she was a little girl<br/>
and she was very sad about it. It has always made me<br/>
wonder if she had a fabulously developed imagination,<br/>
or if whe was recalling a past life, or (I hope not)<br/>
seeing into the future (we now live where there aren&#39;t<br/>
many trees and it&#39;s <br/>
white for 6 months out of the year.) No matter what,<br/>
it was an odd conversation to have with a 2 year old.<br/>
She doesn&#39;t remember any of it now. She&#39;s 7.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Wow! This sounds familiar. Tamzin (also 7) would tell<br/>
me in great detail about her &quot;mummy&quot; she used to have.<br/>
She said that she had brown skin and they first lived<br/>
in a hot place and then they went on a long trip to a<br/>
cold place (she said she was always cold after that).<br/>
She was 2 and a few months the first time she<br/>
mentioned this. She gave details about things that she<br/>
couldn&#39;t possibly know about (that&#39;s what convinced me<br/>
that it wasn&#39;t purely imaginary). She says she never<br/>
grew up (I assume that means she died as a child -<br/>
maybe from the cold?). She still remembers her &#39;family<br/>
from before&#39;, but she rarely talks about them anymore.<br/>
Also the only place in the world that she really wants<br/>
to go to is Africa, always has been. <br/>
