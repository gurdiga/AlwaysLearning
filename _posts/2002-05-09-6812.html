<div id="ygrps-yiv-629006027">We have binoculars, maps, &quot;The Roadside Geology of Montana&quot;, rock and<br/>
mineral field guide, shovel, pail, screen, magnifying glass, rock pick, (<br/>
can you guess what we do a lot of?)  and once, for about half a block,<br/>
the neighbors cat.    I think I&#39;ll add a dictionary. <br/>
My dh always has a fishing rod in his truck.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a little book called &quot;Names on the Face Of Montana&quot;.   It gives a<br/>
brief history of place names.  It&#39;s great in the car when you drive<br/>
through  &quot;Two Dot&quot; and wonder just how the hell it got a name like that. <br/>
It&#39;s been in our car for the last year or so.  I don&#39;t know if they exist<br/>
for all the states.  <br/>

New Mexico Place Names is our state&#39;s version.  It&#39;s WONDERFUL.<br/>

scootering, and biking people when we lived in Alameda, and we&#39;re still<br/>

miles from any town at all). So our car is fuller... we have:<br/>

2 mitts, a softball, and a baseball<br/>
2 tennis rackets<br/>
2 racket ball rackets<br/>

Yolo County phone book (pretty small, covers Woodland and Davis, the big<br/>

This is sweet to me.   We&#39;ve never been big on mother&#39;s day or father&#39;s day <br/>
here at all, and often I&#39;ve been out of town at an SCA event without my kids <br/>
(it&#39;s our coronation weekend--tournaments and feasts and elevation of the new <br/>
king and queen for the next six months), and that&#39;s where my husband is this <br/>
weekend, in Colorado Springs.  But I&#39;m not doing much SCA these days, and so <br/>
I&#39;m home with the kids, who are all asleep.  But when I got up I was putzing <br/>
around, watering the tomatoes and onions, cleaning up the back yard a bit, <br/>
picking up dishes in the den, wondering what would be a perfect mother&#39;s day <br/>
thing for me and I thought:<br/>
<br/>
I would like to magically have my toddlers back for one day.<br/>
<br/>
And when I had toddlers we had those kinds of things in the car, so Mary&#39;s <br/>
list brought tears to my eyes.  Raffi cassettes, sand-play equipment, jump <br/>
rope, sidewalk chalk (which we actually do have some of in the van right now <br/>
anyway &lt;g&gt;)...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad my kids are healthy and happy, but two are too big to pick up, and <br/>
one (Holly, who slept with me last night) is on the verge of being so, and I <br/>
would love to have one in the backpack and one in arms and them peeking at <br/>
each other over my shoulder while the other one got totally excited about <br/>
seeing a butterfly.  I&#39;m glad to have such memories.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In one of those stand out days of my life, I stood there looking at my then<br/>
toddling son, tearing around the living room enveloping and celebrating his<br/>
expanding universe. Reviling in the joy that his new found mobility had<br/>
given him. And it hit me.  You had to give up the infant to get the toddler.<br/>
That cooing, flailing, content, seductive bundle of goodness was gone. He<br/>
had burst from his chrysalis a grabbed hold of the world with both hands and<br/>
feet. <br/>
<br/>
And the metamorphosis&#39;s just keep happening. And I keep giving up my son to<br/>
get that next version of goodness.<br/>
<br/>
Now my 5&#39;-11&quot; 12 yo comes to sit on the lap of his 5&#39;-8&quot; mother and once she<br/>
has carefully arranged her legs to help prevent any broken bones, I see that<br/>
content smile bathe over her, that particular smile I first saw on her face<br/>
nursing her brand new infant.<br/>

&gt; Well, you can add me to that list too!  Funnily enough, quite a few<br/>
&gt; of my friends don&#39;t have cell phones either.<br/>
&gt; In my car, there is:  A raquet ball racket and two tennis balls (both<br/>
&gt; belonging to the dogs), gloves, hats, sweatshirts, phone book<br/>
&gt; (for the same reason as Sandra&#39;s), loads of maps, CDs, 4 car<br/>
&gt; bingo games, a bottle of bubbles, &#39;treasures&#39; of Tamzin&#39;s (like<br/>
&gt; rocks, dead flowers, bits of questionable old stuff, etc.), string,<br/>
&gt; tape, scissors, drawing paper, colored pencils, a tire iron, lip<br/>
&gt; balm, hand cream, water, Altoids (cinnamon, of course), doll car<br/>
&gt; seat, magazine entitled, &quot;101 Things To Do In Butte County&quot;, the<br/>
&gt; last 2 weeks of the Chico News and Review, picnic blanket,<br/>
&gt; math Wrap Ups, and I&#39;m sure there&#39;s other stuff I&#39;m forgetting but<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s the main stuff.<br/>

cell phone &lt;g&gt;); since I&#39;d already done the inertia experiments, I decided<br/>
to keep the car cleaned out =:-0<br/>
<br/>
I have 6 cassette tapes, secured more or less in a slot below the dash; maps<br/>
secured in the pockets built into the doors; sunscreen, car manual,<br/>
insurance and registration in the glove box, and a blanket and towels in the<br/>
trunk area, because the puppy gets carsick.  I&#39;ve thought about putting a<br/>
dog barrier behind the back seats, because 2 dogs totalling nearly 90 lbs<br/>
would weigh a heck of a lot more travelling 60 mph through my car if we came<br/>
to a *very* sudden stop.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you&#39;ve got those scissors and tire iron secured.<br/>

the stuff that rode with them was lightweight or soft, and I never let them<br/>

for an offramp!!)</div>

I am one of those &#39;people&#39; with an SUV.  I have a &#39;91 Ford <br/>

I give her a homeopathic remedy called cocculus indicus (one a <br/>
half an hour before travelling and one just before we leave - 30c <br/>
strength).  She still drools a lot, but never gets sick anymore.  We <br/>
still have the barrier though to prevent her from drooling all over <br/>
the heads of the backseat passengers &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt; I hope you&#39;ve got those scissors and tire iron <br/>
secured.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

Absolutely, we have a plastic box with a lid on it for art supplies.  <br/>
And the tire iron is strapped under the back seat.<br/>

&gt;&lt;&lt; Our van does have snacks,<br/>
&gt;jackets, strollers, carrier, sand box toys, balls,<br/>
&gt;coloring/activity/workbooks (they&#39;re all the same to us), pencils, colored<br/>
&gt;pencils, papers, maps, books, my 4yodd&#39;s backpack of baby dolls, assorted<br/>
&gt;small toys, cassettes, socks and shoes (2yods loves to wiggle his<br/>
&gt;tootsies!), Elmo that stays in the van, the other 2 are in the house, and<br/>
&gt;whatever else my kiddos bring along no matter the length of a drive. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is sweet to me.   We&#39;ve never been big on mother&#39;s day or father&#39;s day<br/>
&gt;here at all, and often I&#39;ve been out of town at an SCA event without my <br/>
&gt;kids<br/>
&gt;(it&#39;s our coronation weekend--tournaments and feasts and elevation of the <br/>
&gt;new<br/>
&gt;king and queen for the next six months), and that&#39;s where my husband is <br/>
&gt;this<br/>
&gt;weekend, in Colorado Springs.  But I&#39;m not doing much SCA these days, and <br/>
&gt;so<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m home with the kids, who are all asleep.  But when I got up I was <br/>
&gt;putzing<br/>
&gt;around, watering the tomatoes and onions, cleaning up the back yard a bit,<br/>
&gt;picking up dishes in the den, wondering what would be a perfect mother&#39;s <br/>
&gt;day<br/>
&gt;thing for me and I thought:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I would like to magically have my toddlers back for one day.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And when I had toddlers we had those kinds of things in the car, so Mary&#39;s<br/>
&gt;list brought tears to my eyes.  Raffi cassettes, sand-play equipment, jump<br/>
&gt;rope, sidewalk chalk (which we actually do have some of in the van right <br/>
&gt;now<br/>
&gt;anyway &lt;g&gt;)...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m glad my kids are healthy and happy, but two are too big to pick up, and<br/>
&gt;one (Holly, who slept with me last night) is on the verge of being so, and <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt;would love to have one in the backpack and one in arms and them peeking at<br/>
&gt;each other over my shoulder while the other one got totally excited about<br/>
&gt;seeing a butterfly.  I&#39;m glad to have such memories.<br/>
