<div id="ygrps-yiv-135575813">My favorite online comic is Sinfest.  The author/artist is Tatsuya Ishida.  <br/>
It won&#39;t be to everyone&#39;s tastes, but it involves philosophy, religion, and <br/>
teenage angst.   It&#39;s at www.sinfest.net<br/>
but each week there&#39;s a little editorial comment, and here&#39;s the current one:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-On judgment. People are always going on about how bad it is to judge <br/>
others, how no one has the right to pass judgment and don&#39;t you dare judge me <br/>
who the hell do you think you are and so on and so forth. Which sort of makes <br/>
a mockery of our court system, our sporting events, and of course, American <br/>
Idol. Without judges, these esteemed institutions of American culture would <br/>
cease to function. And nobody wants that. Without judgment all manner of <br/>
disputes would go unresolved, athletics would fail to deliver a winner, and <br/>
we&#39;d have no President. Judgment ain&#39;t a bad thing in and of itself. Until, <br/>
of course, someone judges me, and I&#39;ll be all like, &quot;What, you judging me? <br/>
Don&#39;t you dare judge me. Who the hell do you think you are?&quot; <br/>
-T. -=-<br/>

about it over a year ago. BIG fan here too. But I&#39;ve never gotten the <br/>
editorial comment! How would I go about that?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Go to the site.<br/>
<br/>
And if you click on &quot;strips&quot; it lists all of them from the beginning.  <br/>
<br/>
And they have t-shirts. &lt;g&gt;</div>

Can that come monthly or whatever---or do I have to go to the site to find <br/>
it?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll need a t-shirt! &lt;G&gt;  or two!<br/>

don&#39;t think they&#39;ve collected up old ones anywhere.</div>
