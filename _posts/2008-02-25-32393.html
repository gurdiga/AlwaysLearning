<div id="ygrps-yiv-24429628">I have a question about TV and limits/no limits. My daughter is 20 <br/>
months old. Until she was about 17-18 months she &quot;watched&quot; very <br/>
little TV and it was pretty easy to keep it that way. Sometimes we <br/>
had it on and she was playing but she didn&#39;t actually sit and watch <br/>
for extended periods of time. We were mostly outside playing every <br/>
day.<br/>
<br/>
Now as the winter weather has hit and she has gotten older she is <br/>
watching more. First she really liked a couple of the Baby Einstein <br/>
videos. She is currently hooked on &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
I have to admit that I find it quite refreshing to find a different <br/>
perspective on &quot;screen time&quot;. And I hope that as my daughter gets <br/>
older that I will achieve with her and our relationship what so many <br/>
of you have with your children that apply unschooling principles to <br/>
your whole life. <br/>
<br/>
ok, long introduction to get to my question -- is there a certain age <br/>
when you think that having no limits applies (of course offering <br/>
other fun things to do and not using TV as a babysitter) or does it <br/>
start from the time that they can let you know their opinions? I <br/>
spent so much time feeling guilty about any TV and reading books <br/>
and &quot;research&quot; that said no TV until they&#39;re 2 that I don&#39;t know what <br/>
to think. <br/>
<br/>
For example-- DD woke up from nap and wanted to watch &quot;Nemo&quot; right <br/>
away. Of course now I am having the opportunity to right this post! :-<br/>
) I have to say though-- I love the movie! Sandra I just read your <br/>
article about humor/jokes and LOVE all the humor in children&#39;s movies <br/>
that is clearly meant for adults.<br/>
<br/>
ok, any input on this would be much appreciated. I sometimes feel <br/>
that I am just learning how to form my own opinions... that I am <br/>
finally waking up and seeing that there are other ways to live and it <br/>
looks so good! <br/>

&gt;<br/>
FWIW, we are a no-limits TV house (course, we live on a boat, and watch DVDs<br/>
on a computer, so I suppose that&#39;s a form of limiting), and at age 5, nearly<br/>
6 (eeek!), Rowan routinely chooses to go to his room and read, or play<br/>
legos, or draw, or do any one of a gazillion other things. Especially when<br/>
it&#39;s Kestrel&#39;s turn to pick a movie and he grabs Nemo. =) =) =)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1989548675">Our son has always picked a favorite movie and watched it over and over again.  Then he will begin to watch just favorite parts of the movie.  He is 13 now and will still do this - though not as much.<br/>
<br/>
I clearly remember Mary Poppins and the dance scenes being played over and over when he was about 3 or 4.  Which led to a love of the &quot;River Dance&quot; film we had and he still likes Celtic music - especially bagpipe.  And he knows tons about the history of the Celts.<br/>
<br/>
Mostly for our son though he does not only watch, he is usually doing other things too - such as legos or dancing along with the chimney sweeps ;)<br/>
<br/>
A couple of weeks ago he wanted to rent the entire series of &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;  He ended up with all his &quot;G.I. Joes&quot; action figures out and completely turned the family room into a war zone.  Every pillow and spare blanket was used to make hills and trenches - even the camera tripod was used for a look out tower.  I don&#39;t think he ever finished watching all the shows - but his creative juices were in high gear for over a week.  And that led to more knowledge about WWII.  Oh and at one point he was talking about / investigating scale models (for instance if the camera tripod was in scale to the figures in relationship to a real look out tower and real people.)  He actually used the terms &quot;to scale&quot;    I spent something like 30 dollars to rent those shows but it is like the Visa commercial - price for the learning / activities / contentment / joy / = priceless!<br/>
<br/>
These movies and shows - are almost always a catalist for other activities.  <br/>
<br/>
I must add though - we do have moments now and then when we snuggle up on the couch (yup he is bigger than me and he still lays all over me in a kind of side drape) to watch a movie.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Most of the research I have read is goofy. None of the viewing situations <br/>
which them contrive are remotely like the way tv is watched in my house.<br/>

a lot. She does so less now, but that may change again.<br/>
<br/>
I wrote about tv here www.sandradodd.com/whatif#robyn amongst other writers <br/>
on that page - I&#39;m the green box. Nothing has changed except that Jayn has <br/>
added more variety to her viewing interests. Sometimes I am even getting a <br/>

Jennifer Love Hewitt.<br/>

over her head, she&#39;ll be able to get it. Meanwhile, &quot;what the deuce?&quot;<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Using TV as a babysitter&quot; is one of those lines people use to  <br/>
manipulate feelings of parents.<br/>
<br/>
Try to let those phrase go.  Don&#39;t hang on to guilt like that.<br/>
<br/>
Children can let you know their opinions from infancy, right?  You  <br/>
couldn&#39;t make a child watch TV.  They can look away or whimper or whine.<br/>
<br/>
htp://sandradodd.com/yes<br/>
<br/>
Saying yes is pretty wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
-=-ok, any input on this would be much appreciated. I sometimes feel  <br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s a good argument for letting your daughter form her own  <br/>
opinions about little bitty things right now, so when the big things  <br/>
come she&#39;ll have years of experience.<br/>

dinosaurs.  Every day, more than once a day.  The documentary was 6 or  <br/>
8 hours long, I think &lt;g&gt;  One day ds was taking a bath, and I heard  <br/>
him talking to himself and walking back and forth in the tub.  He was  <br/>
reciting dialogue about fossilized dino footprints found at the bottom  <br/>
of the &quot;floxy river,&quot; imitating the narrator pretty well ;-)<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re 20 and 17 now, btw, and none of the scary possible outcomes of  <br/>
unlimited video viewing have happened.  They&#39;re eyes haven&#39;t grown out  <br/>
on stalks (Monty Python ;-))) and they haven&#39;t stopped reading, become  <br/>
obese and, as far as I can tell since we don&#39;t test, haven&#39;t gotten  <br/>
any dumber.<br/>

That&#39;s where my thoughts went yesterday when my mother called me, fuming  and <br/>
complaining about my brother (again) and how he makes such big mistakes: He  <br/>
bought a computer on payments that he couldn&#39;t complete the payments on, he  <br/>
bought a new car that was out of his price range and eventually was <br/>
repossessed,  he&#39;s been on the verge of having utilities turned of numerous times and <br/>
almost  evicted twice. My mother always stepped in for him when he had the least <br/>
little  difficulty or was doing something &quot;wrong&quot;. He was never *allowed* to <br/>
make small,  easily remedied or minorly painful mistakes when he was growing <br/>
up, so now he  makes big mistakes like paying a large amount of cash to two guys <br/>
in Indonesia  he got an e-mail from-supposedly to set up a product selling <br/>
website. What is my  mother&#39;s idea to get him out of this? Take him to court and <br/>
have him declared  incompetent so that she can run his life &quot;right&quot; (he&#39;s 39 <br/>
years old in 2  months). At least one good thing comes from it, though-it <br/>
helps me to not &quot;sweat  the small stuff&quot; with my kids and put my controlling urges <br/>
in check. Looks like  my brother won&#39;t have his own experience with making <br/>
mistakes until my mother is  incapable of stepping in any longer.<br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>

Marty watched Dumbo.<br/>

Holly, oddly, watched &quot;Stand By Me,&quot; and now is a Stephen King fan. I  <br/>
think that was also a catalyst in her abiding interest in rock and  <br/>
doo-wop from the late 50&#39;s and early 60&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
  One morning Marty (at 5 or 6) woke up first, came straight to me,  <br/>
and said &quot;Mom, PLEASE don&#39;t let Holly watch &#39;Stand By Me.&#39;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She watched it.  We jollied Marty up other ways.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-518180309">-=-It gives<br/>
some pretty good information about what kids generally can<br/>
follow/comprehend/benefit from at various ages.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are problems when parents expect too much of their children at  <br/>
too young an age.  Sometimes they say &quot;READ, you&#39;re six; READ NOW.&quot;    <br/>
Or they want a very young child to care about tithing or saving money  <br/>
or having an interest-bearing savings account.<br/>
<br/>
Then it&#39;s good to suggest that they might want to read some Piaget  <br/>
stages of child development (which I think everyone should read  <br/>
anyway, now that the subject is on the table).<br/>
<br/>
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, there are problems with reading a book to see  <br/>
what your child can follow or comprehend or benefit from when your  <br/>
child is right there, in the room.<br/>
<br/>
-==...says the reason is that your child needs/learns from human  <br/>
interaction and TV time diminishes that. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Ooooooh.<br/>
<br/>
Well.  Parents need to learn from interaction with their child, and  <br/>
book-reading time diminishes that.<br/>
<br/>
If a show is on and your child is watching and you can tell she&#39;s  <br/>
engaged with the information one way or another, it doesn&#39;t matter  <br/>
what ANY book says.  Look at her.   If she doesn&#39;t like it she&#39;ll  <br/>
turn away and do something else.<br/>
<br/>
How can you tell if a child is engaged/interested/benefiting/thinking?<br/>
<br/>
Look at her eyes.   For babies, are they hopping and dancing or  <br/>
reaching?  Are they looking at that instead of the food you&#39;re trying  <br/>
to put in their mouths?  Are they liking the music, or the movement,  <br/>
or the faces or what?  It doesn&#39;t matter, except to remember that if  <br/>
that other fully-formed yet young human is learning something, you  <br/>
might want to let that continue instead of jealously trying to  <br/>
control and channel his attention and interests.<br/>
<br/>
For verbal older kids, do they talk about it and ask questions or act  <br/>
it out?<br/>
