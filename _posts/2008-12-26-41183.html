<br/>
===============================<br/>
Hi Sandra.  I have what is about the best ammunition against TV that  <br/>
you could hope for.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://radicalacademy.com/studentrefphilfmd11.htm">http://radicalacademy.com/studentrefphilfmd11.htm</a><br/>
I am the author.     Frank Martin DiMeglio<br/>
What can you do to help?<br/>
<br/>
==============================<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a very short article.   Before I quote part of it, I want to  <br/>
share something from &quot;Teach Your Own&quot;--John Holt quoting an article  <br/>
called &quot;Pumping Polysyllabism, from August 1977 Mother Jones (I  <br/>
couldn&#39;t find that article):<br/>
<br/>
*******************<br/>
<br/>
Two Chicago English professors have found that a good way to improve  <br/>
your grade on a term paper is to use what they call &quot;verbose,  <br/>
bombastic&quot; language.<br/>
<br/>
Professors Joseph Williams and Rosemary Hake say they took a well- <br/>
written paper and changed the language a bit.  They kept the ideas  <br/>
and concepts the same, but wrote two different versions--one in  <br/>
simplified, straightforward language and another in verbose language,  <br/>
loaded with pedantic terms.<br/>
<br/>
They then submitted the two papers to nine high school teachers; they  <br/>
were surprised to find that all nine gave the verbose papers nearly  <br/>
perfect scores but downgraded the straightforward essays as too  <br/>
simple and shallow.<br/>
<br/>
The professors then submitted the same two papers to ninety more  <br/>
teachers and came up with similar results.  Three out of four high  <br/>
school teachers and two out of three college professors gave higher  <br/>
marks to pompous writing.<br/>
<br/>
***************(end of the quote)***********<br/>
<br/>
The premise of the DiMeglio article is that hallucinations are like  <br/>
dreams, and hallucinations have to do with mental and emotional  <br/>
disorders, so TV being like dreams in some ways.... well  I shouldn&#39;t  <br/>
do him any favors by extracting clarity from muck.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the middle of the article.   The beginning and end aren&#39;t any  <br/>
better:<br/>
<br/>
+++++++++++++++++++<br/>
<br/>
It is not only in the dream that the vision of each individual person  <br/>
is necessarily different. That is obvious. Importantly, the  <br/>
experience of television is uniquely that of the individual.<br/>
<br/>
Television may be understood as a creation of generalized thought.  <br/>
The ability of thought to describe or reconfigure sense is ultimately  <br/>
dependent upon the extent to which thought is similar to sense.<br/>
<br/>
Television makes thought even more like vision than in the dream,  <br/>
thereby reducing thought and vision.<br/>
<br/>
++++++++++++(end of the quote)+++++++<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to link that anti-TV article on this page<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/t/anti">http://sandradodd.com/t/anti</a><br/>
<br/>
I like that his writing and thinking are so garbled, while my own  <br/>
teens are so articulate.  Holly&#39;s up watching a DVD of Fresh Prince  <br/>
of Bel-Air and Marty was playing Rock Band when he got tired of  <br/>
watching a DVD he got for Christmas of Tenacious D episodes from HBO.<br/>
<br/>
They both got books for Christmas, too, and lots of music and  <br/>
movies.  Holly got a sewing machine. Marty got a skateboard (from  <br/>
Holly) and a drum stool and some new Rock Band drums.     I&#39;m not  <br/>
worried about them at all.   This guy with the terrible article on  <br/>
the evils of TV (and of sleeping and dreaming, it seems), though...  <br/>
he could use some clarity (and sleep, and dreaming, and TV-watching,  <br/>
and Rock Band playing, maybe).<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I couldn&#39;t even finish reading the article.  I got about half way<br/>
through it before I couldn&#39;t take any more of it.<br/>
<br/>
In the very first paragraph, I started balking at the idea of finishing<br/>
the article because of this...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Television thus compels attention, as it is compelled in the dream; but<br/>
it is an unnatural and hallucinatory experience. Hence, television is<br/>
addictive.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t stand logical fallacies if they are being used to convince me to<br/>
believe something!  They are kind of fun if you are just reading and<br/>
playing with ideas!<br/>
<br/>
Since the whole article is based on a logical fallacy, it was hard to<br/>
finish it, or look at any of the ideas presented in it as having any<br/>
validity.</div>

Jenny, you were kind to give him &quot;logical fallacy.&quot;  I thought it was  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, well, I couldn&#39;t finish the article because it was too hard to<br/>
read.  A good article should draw me in with valuable information based<br/>
on solid reasoning.  I kept reading and wandering off, because I wasn&#39;t<br/>
able to follow the convoluted thought process that started off with a<br/>
logical fallacy.<br/>
<br/>
It was terribly ironic that all the sideline articles were on<br/>
philosophy, which is supposed to be logical reasoning of ideas and<br/>
thought.  There was even a definition of logical fallacy in their<br/>
glossary of terms section.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes yes yes!  We&#39;ve had lots of things around here to draw our<br/>
attention, like the record amounts of snowfall that also came on<br/>
Christmas!  We still can&#39;t get out!  We&#39;ve found TV to be invaluable<br/>
during our time of being snowed in!  Since we watched so much TV over<br/>
the last few days, we&#39;ve gotten bored with our standard fare and<br/>
searched out some new and different stuff and it was interesting!  And<br/>
even if our power had gone out, we still would&#39;ve found something<br/>
intersting to do!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1348835717">Yep. I don&#39;t understand much on the page. But, I get the strange<br/>
feeling that his basic idea could be much better expressed in a simple<br/>
sentence or two. <br/>
<br/>
I did get this: &quot;television compels attention to the relative<br/>
exclusion of other experience&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I disagree. As a teenager, I watched TV shows and built websites,<br/>
surfed the net, folded clothes, exercised, among other things. My MIL<br/>
watches as she cooks supper and FIL encouraged himself to run further<br/>
on his treadmill by putting a tv near it...so, is that watching TV to<br/>
the exclusion of other experience? <br/>
<br/>
My sons watch &quot;Activity TV&#39; and follow the onscreen directions to<br/>
build paper airplanes, and other crafts. They spread out their legos<br/>
and build towns while they watch cartoons. <br/>
<br/>
Am I misunderstanding his meaning? or is it just not true?</div>

I think you understood it better than he did.  I had the impression  <br/>
that the author thought if he strung enough negative phrases together  <br/>
that suggested dangerous evil that he might accidentally prove a point.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1549691794">wow that is complete bullshit for the sake of being bullshit.  its almost as if he thought, i <br/>
know, i&#39;ll write an article comparing two things that don&#39;t relate AT ALL, throw in a handful <br/>
of &quot;hence&quot;s, &quot;likewise&quot;s and &quot;accordingly&quot;s to convince and impress people.  <br/>
<br/>
does that really work on most?  scary if it does.  <br/>
<br/>
can&#39;t stop myself from thinking that maybe the article was written in another language <br/>
and translated using Babel Fish.  <br/>
<br/>
maybe he SHOULD watch some tv to help him reconfigure and hence compel the <br/>
cultivation of what i would consider to be his hallucinatory and unnatural perception of <br/>
English syntax, grammar and semantics.  wink, wink.<br/>
