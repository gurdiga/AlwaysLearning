<div id="ygrps-yiv-1706131076">Some of the discussion recently (&quot;the right way&quot; thread) reminded me of shame researcher Brene Brown.  I think her work could have a profound influence on many people, especially those of us deschooling ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
Here are her books:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
And her Ted Talks:<br/>

<br/>
The Ted Talks go in that order, but if you&#39;re really short on time you could skip to around 6:00 in the Vulnerability talk and 14:00 in the Shame talk to hear what she has to say about shame and guilt.<br/>

Guilt doesn&#39;t need to be shame.<br/>
I don&#39;t think we were speaking of shame.<br/>
<br/>
Shame tends to come from without, and no one here was advocating that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, in the video, at those points I mentioned, Brene Brown explains the difference between shame and guilty clearly.  Similar to what you said earlier, Sandra, she states that guilt can be helpful for changing our own behaviors.  She explains how shame is not helpful, and has the opposite effect.  It&#39;s a really interesting video.<br/>
<br/>
Although the word &quot;shame&quot; wasn&#39;t used much in the discussion, several people were describing it and calling it &quot;guilt&quot;.<br/>
