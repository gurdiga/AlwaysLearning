 </span></blockquote>I love Monty Python.  Used to watch the Flying Circus all the time.  I do<br/>
have to say that I think The Life of Brian is one of the best, even better<br/>
than the Holy Grail.  I think I really like it because it really pokes<br/>
great fun at a certain religion.  Sorry all, not a big organized religios<br/>
person here.  How Brian became a religious icon is great.<br/>
