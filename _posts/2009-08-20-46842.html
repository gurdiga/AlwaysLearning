YES, unschooling would be great for a child who is for whatever<br/>
reasons &quot;behind the curve&quot; in some area, but the parent can&#39;t just<br/>
utter the word &quot;unschooling&quot; and expect the child to change and start<br/>
learning all kinds of cool things on her own. The parents will need<br/>
to become unschooling parents...........................<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I want to learn how to be an unschooling parent.<br/>
<br/>
I have 5 kids.  4 boys by birth and 1 girl who we adopted almost 2 years<br/>
ago.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter was 8 when she came to us.  She is behind in many ways (she<br/>
had many homes and at least 10 schools by the time she came here) and I<br/>
am trying to become the best parent I can for her.  The boys have come<br/>
to unschooling completely different then she has.  They seem to be<br/>
thriving where she seems to be doing something different.  I do not want<br/>
to debate the tv issue, I want to understand it.  She LOVES tv. <br/>
Sometime I feel she just looses herself in it.  I am wondering if I<br/>
completely let go and embrace her television watching will she get lost<br/>
in there?  I am trying to release a few fears in regards to this. <br/>
Meeting Pams daughter helped with that some.  She has a hard time making<br/>
friends with other children.  She is supper sweet to little kids, she<br/>
wants to be a teenager but she pesters them so much they get annoyed and<br/>
she does not seem to fit in with kids near her age.  I am not sure if I<br/>
should worry about this or not.  I am trying to allow the unschooling<br/>
philosiphy to wash over me.  I have been trying to work on my<br/>
relationships with my kids.  Thinking of them as their own persons<br/>
growing up with my help.  My biggest problem is parenting my daughter. <br/>
We are SO different.  We do not like the same things.  She is really<br/>
into fashion and tv and I am totally not.  How can I come to her and be<br/>
a better Mom.  How do I sort this out?<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry if this sounds so jumbled.  I am just seaking guidance.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually 10ish to 12ish is a very typical time to get fascinated by  <br/>
TV. The preteen years are a time of transition between kid interests  <br/>
and more grow up interests. TV and video games and what looks like  <br/>
very &quot;shallow&quot; interests like fashion and beauty and pre-teen social  <br/>
interactions (like in the Nickelodeon and Disney shows) seem to fit  <br/>
their needs.<br/>
<br/>
It won&#39;t last forever! (Or at least not in that form.)<br/>
<br/>
But the best thing you can do is step back away from trying to mold  <br/>
or steer her and be a friend. Find out what she likes about her  <br/>
favorite programs. Just ask conversationally. Don&#39;t look for her to  <br/>
convince you they&#39;re worthwhile! She&#39;s already showing you by  <br/>
watching them that they are worthwhile to the person she is at this  <br/>
time. Watch some with her so you know who the characters are and  <br/>
their relationships with each other so you&#39;ll understand when she  <br/>
tells you something.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am wondering if I<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The only kids I&#39;ve known who got lost in TV were the ones who used it  <br/>
as an escape from life. If she feels you&#39;re someone she wants to  <br/>
escape from -- critical, watching and judging what she does (even in  <br/>
silence), pulling or pushing her to do something else -- she could  <br/>
retreat to the TV where she&#39;s accepted for who she is, where her  <br/>
humor and interests are fed and supported and she&#39;s not seen as not  <br/>
as good as her brothers.<br/>
<br/>
(You may not put it into words like that but if she&#39;s ever heard an  <br/>
encouraging tone in your voice when the boys asked to do something  <br/>
and a sigh or a flat okay when she wants to do something (when you  <br/>
wished she&#39;d pick something that seemed more worthy of her time) then  <br/>
she knows. Kids pick up a huge amount from tone and body language  <br/>
that we don&#39;t realize we&#39;re saying.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She is supper sweet to little kids, she<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That seems not unusual! She&#39;s in between child and teen and doesn&#39;t  <br/>
fit into either camp at the moment. Teachers will tell you the  <br/>
preteen years are a holding pen. ;-) They really don&#39;t know what to  <br/>
do with middle schoolers because they&#39;re all over the board in  <br/>
interests and abilities so it&#39;s hard to reach them. So it&#39;s not  <br/>
unusual that preteens wouldn&#39;t be able to relate to each other. (And  <br/>
schooled teens don&#39;t want &quot;kids&quot; hanging around so it would be an  <br/>
unusually socially savvy preteen who could fit in.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My biggest problem is parenting my daughter.<br/>

&gt; a better Mom. How do I sort this out?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>By not worrying that the world she&#39;s exploring right now is where  <br/>
she&#39;s headed for the rest of her life! By joining her and exploring  <br/>
it with her, at least enough to have a conversation with her. What if  <br/>
she were into motocross or rodeos or existential plays or Mandarin  <br/>
poetry or ... How would you support those interests that were far  <br/>
outside your own?<br/>
<br/>
I suspect your fear that if you support &quot;shallow, unworthy&quot; interests  <br/>
you&#39;ll be creating a shallow person might be getting in your way of  <br/>
embracing them. What you&#39;re in effect doing, though, is driving her  <br/>
to them because those outlets support who she is when you don&#39;t.  <br/>
They&#39;re feeling more like a friend than you are. That sounds harsh  <br/>
but she can only react to how she feels not how you want her to feel  <br/>
or how you want her to understand how you feel. If the TV is feeling  <br/>
more supportive and friendly, it&#39;s where she&#39;ll turn for comfort.<br/>

We had even had hearing test done on her when she was a few years old. She would just zone us out. They told me that she had selective hearing and would just hear what she wanted. That she could just block out what she didnt want to hear. Well you can imagine homeschooling her. She forgets things right after I teach them and I can tell she just blocks me out.

<br/>
My cousin Nadine was eight when she came to live with us in New  <br/>
Mexico.  She had been removed from her mother&#39;s custody and was going  <br/>
to go into the Texas foster care system.  She was at the Lena Polk  <br/>
home, basically an orphanage.   Her older sister, Nada, who was closer  <br/>
to my age, already lived with us.<br/>
<br/>
Nadine watched TV differently from the rest of us for years.  She  <br/>
couldn&#39;t tell cartoons from live action at first.  She would be so  <br/>
engrossed in the TV that she couldn&#39;t hear someone in the same room  <br/>
saying her name.<br/>
<br/>
It seemed to me that that was her &quot;I would rather not be here&quot;  <br/>
place.   I don&#39;t blame her.<br/>
<br/>
We recently took in two cats.  I like them.  They almost like me. It&#39;s  <br/>
been over two months, though, and they still clearly would rather be  <br/>
back where they used to live.  For two years they lived with a woman  <br/>
who baby-talked them constantly, and they were home.  Now they&#39;re in a  <br/>
bigger house, there&#39;s a dog, two other cats (they&#39;ve split the house,  <br/>
territorially, and I feed them in two different places).<br/>
<br/>
My choices are to accept that and keep being nice, or to become  <br/>
threatening and punitive and shaming.  I could deprive them of the  <br/>
room they&#39;re used to by closing it up but then they&#39;d be afraid and  <br/>
probably run away.<br/>
<br/>
-=- She is supper sweet to little kids, she<br/>
wants to be a teenager but she pesters them so much they get annoyed and<br/>
she does not seem to fit in with kids near her age. I am not sure if I<br/>
should worry about this or not.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t worry, because the worry doesn&#39;t help.  The first time my son,  <br/>
Kirby, hung out with a group of kids all his same age was when he was  <br/>
15, was at an anime convention in another state (with his older  <br/>
friends) and met up with a group of high school kids from Denver.  He  <br/>
would&#39;ve been in their grade at school, if he had lived there, so they  <br/>
welcomed him into their group.   He was excited about it, and even  <br/>
went to Denver months later to visit them.  In person away from a  <br/>
convention, though, they weren&#39;t as fun.  He was the same both times,  <br/>
but they had been putting on some sparkle for the occasion.  He still  <br/>
did have fun with them, but was disappointed.<br/>
<br/>
Having same-age friends isn&#39;t a worthy goal in itself.  What school  <br/>
does is unnatural and harmful to the growth of human behavior, when  <br/>
they put 30, 120, however many ten-year-olds all together.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Thinking of them as their own persons<br/>
growing up with my help. My biggest problem is parenting my daughter.<br/>
We are SO different. We do not like the same things. She is really<br/>

a better Mom. How do I sort this out?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I have long advocated treating children as a guest in one&#39;s home, and  <br/>
when the child is more foreign (genetically, and maybe culturally)  <br/>
than your own children, it&#39;s doubly applicable.   She would probably  <br/>
rather be with her own parents.  You don&#39;t need to talk about that  <br/>
with her, but it would be good to keep it in mind.  When she sees her  <br/>
brothers with you and their dad, she must be jealous.  I know my  <br/>
cousins were.  We were with our real parents; they were not.  No  <br/>
amount of pretending or regulating or stating that we were all equal  <br/>
could ever have made it so in their minds, especially Nadine&#39;s, who  <br/>
always felt she was there against her will.  Nada had chosen to stay  <br/>
with us several times, which turned into permanent gradually, but  <br/>
Nadine had always wanted to stay with her mom.<br/>

That was an official diagnosis, &quot;selective hearing&quot;?  &quot;Selective  <br/>
hearing&quot; is an insult, not a medical condition.<br/>

<br/>
Poor thing.<br/>
<br/>
Was she adopted too?  You said &quot;exactly the same boat.&quot;   Exactly the  <br/>
same not-a-genetic-match boat?  Or the same preference for TV?<br/>

lost with her. I have even bought educational movies but she knows  <br/>

-=-<br/>
<br/>
Please read again, twice or more, what Joyce wrote, then.   You&#39;ve  <br/>
made an antagonistic situation.  She and her interests are pitted  <br/>
against you and &quot;education.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
For unschooling to work, the parent has to change.  No options; no outs.<br/>
You, the mom, *must* if you want to unschool (as opposed to &quot;trying  <br/>
unschooling&quot;), learn to see the value and the learning in gathering  <br/>
information from any kind of source and fitting it into one&#39;s own  <br/>
model of the universe.  She won&#39;t learn the same things from a movie  <br/>
you do, even if you watch it together and discuss it.  She has  <br/>
different interests and knowledge and she will glean different bits of  <br/>
&quot;news&quot; and samples and images and sounds to remember than you will.<br/>
<br/>
-=-. She had always been behind in speaking. We had even had hearing  <br/>
test done on her when she was a few years old. She would just zone us  <br/>
out. They told me that she had selective hearing and would just hear  <br/>
what she wanted. That she could just block out what she didnt want to  <br/>
hear.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Had you asked us when that was current, I would&#39;ve said to stop  <br/>
talking to her.  Use more non-verbal, gentle communication as you  <br/>
would with a baby.  If she&#39;s ignoring you, she&#39;s tired of hearing the  <br/>
noise.  So stop the noise.  If she were cold, you&#39;d cover her up.  If  <br/>
she were hungry, you would give her food.  But with her showing with  <br/>
all her baby might that she didn&#39;t want to hear you, you kept talking,  <br/>
it seems.<br/>
<br/>
Possibly she&#39;s an introvert in a household of extroverts.   If so,  <br/>
give her more time alone.  Don&#39;t ask her so many questions.  Wait  <br/>
until she&#39;s ready to ask or talk.<br/>

This made me cry.  I know I do this.  I always question why she asks for things.  No matter what it is.  You know I fell completely in love with her at first sight.  Now I am learning how to deal with who she really is.  I had unfair visions of what it would be like to have a daughter.  She is not here to fill a need in me she is here for me to help raise and nurture.  Sometimes I forget that especially when times are difficult.  <br/>

Having same-age friends isn&#39;t a worthy goal in itself. What school <br/>

they put 30, 120, however many ten-year-olds all together. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I agree that what school does is unnatural.  I just worry because she doesnt seem to be making any real friends.  Her friends are more like somtimes friends.  She get upset when the brothers have someone to go do something with but she doesnt.  I do try to do fun things with just her and I but I assume it is not the same as having a best friend. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 She would probably <br/>
rather be with her own parents. You don&#39;t need to talk about that <br/>
with her, but it would be good to keep it in mind. When she sees her <br/>
brothers with you and their dad, she must be jealous. I know my <br/>
cousins were. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I know this is very true.  She has actually stated this to me once.  We were outside and talking to our 7yo son and laughing and hugging.  She was watching from around the corner.  My first reaction was she was being sneaky.  When I confronted her I was upset because she wouldn&#39;t tell me what she was doing.  Then she finally said she was jealous of him and she didnt want to interupt because she didnt want to take the time away from him.  This is her favorite brother.  My heart aches for her.  I am very conflicted inside in regards to her.  Sometime I treat her in a way I would never treat my kids.  Why is that.  I dont want to be that way and I find myself very stressed over the whole thing.  Then it makes me even more impatient.  My friends will say well she is better off with you on your worst day then she was before on her best day.  That is not what I want for her JUST better then what she had.  I want her to get the upbringing she deserves. <br/>

<br/>
If you&#39;re running a dialog about how she should have real friends, but  <br/>
you&#39;ll hang around with her until she does (even if you&#39;re running it  <br/>
in your mind), she might rather be by herself.<br/>

You were upset more than she was, it seems.  She needs a trusting,  <br/>
safe, warm place, not a place that sees her as uncooperative and  <br/>
sneaky, if you can manage to change any of those factors or postures.<br/>
<br/>

that-=-<br/>

Because she&#39;s adopted.  She&#39;s not your biological child.  For all the  <br/>
non-political-correctness of it, there is and always will be and  <br/>
couldn&#39;t help but be a difference.<br/>
<br/>
Please don&#39;t fail to spend time with your boys, one-on-one, and times  <br/>
when their sister isn&#39;t there.  Speaking as a biological child (one of  <br/>
two) who was crowded by two others, it&#39;s not nice to say &quot;She  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t be here,&quot; but the feeling can take up a lot of space.  And  <br/>
the care of the other kids (half the kids in the family, for ten years  <br/>
or so) took money, time, space, attention, emotion...<br/>
<br/>
-=My friends will say well she is better off with you on your worst  <br/>
day then she was before on her best day.  That is not what I want for  <br/>
her JUST better then what she had.  I want her to get the upbringing  <br/>
she deserves. -=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Deserves&quot; in what way?  Be clear with your thoughts and words.<br/>
Don&#39;t keep your boys from having the upbringing they are entitled to  <br/>
for having been born and survived in your care.  They are with their  <br/>
parents.  Be sure to be there.<br/>

<br/>
We could help you get into fashion in really fun ways -- like TONIGHT! <br/>
Project Runway comes back on the air tonight - we are SO excited - can&#39;t <br/>
wait. I am so NOT into fashion - you cannot possibly be LESS interested <br/>
in fashion than I am. But Project Runway was my introduction to how much <br/>
fun it can be. Ren (on this list) was m introduction to how artistic <br/>
make up is - her unabashed enjoyment of it is very contagious. And, <br/>
getting involved in theater got me even more interested in fashion and <br/>
make up.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of making a point of your differences, your job as unschooling <br/>
mom is to support HERS. If she&#39;s interested in fashion, then that&#39;s what <br/>
you support.<br/>
<br/>
We used to  have these fashion plates that the kids LOVED to use to <br/>
design clothing - here is a picture of what we had, you&#39;ll have to <br/>
google around to find them, but I highly suggest getting your hands on <br/>
them - my kids played and played and played with them!<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.inthe80s.com/toys/image.php?image=http://www.inthe80s.com/toys/images/user-image-1179532673.jpg">http://www.inthe80s.com/toys/image.php?image=http://www.inthe80s.com/toys/images/user-image-1179532673.jpg</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe get In-Style magazine - my kids like it better than any other <br/>
fashion magazines - and make collages or artist trading cards from them. <br/>
Get her her own make-up box and have lots of fun putting make up on each <br/>
other.<br/>
<br/>
Embellished clothing is SO much fun - help her sew trim onto a pair of <br/>
jeans, decorate t-shirt and caps, etc. Again, google around to find out <br/>
more about embellished clothing.<br/>
<br/>
Go to fashion shows - seriously, they are so fun. We went several times <br/>
to American Girl Doll fashion shows and a couple of times to others.<br/>
<br/>
Take a look at the Girl Scout books - you don&#39;t have to buy one, just <br/>
look at the activities that they have for the fashion-related try-its <br/>
and badges and interest projects - that&#39;ll give you some good ideas, too.<br/>
<br/>
I feel like your question indicates a little &quot;missing of the point&quot; of <br/>
unschooling - so what I&#39;m saying is, focus on your daughter&#39;s interests <br/>
and support them - put your energy into that, the rest will take care of <br/>
itself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1256252935">My biggest problem is parenting my daughter.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We are SO different. We do not like the same things. She is really<br/>
&gt; into fashion and tv and I am totally not. How can I come to her and be<br/>
&gt; a better Mom. How do I sort this out?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This makes sense to me, given that you have thus far raised boys. <br/>
You&#39;ve built your life around boy world.  I wonder sometimes what my<br/>
life would&#39;ve been like if I&#39;d had boys or brothers.  I just had a<br/>
conversation about boy underwear, in which, I knew nothing about, except<br/>
for what I know about my husband.  I imagine that if I&#39;d had boys, I&#39;d<br/>
be way more into boy things and supporting boyish interests.<br/>
<br/>
Were you a girl who ever liked fashion?  If you were, remember what it<br/>
felt like and delve into your own girlhood.  I have 2 girls that are<br/>
both into fashion.  Their fashion is totally different, so is their<br/>
musical choices and tv choices.  There are things that I like and<br/>
dislike about both of their choices, but, like all things, I try to see<br/>
what they like in it and see it from their eyes.  It allows me to<br/>
appreciate things that I would otherwise not be into at all.<br/>
<br/>
I went through this with horror movies.  I&#39;ve watched more horror movies<br/>
in the last couple of years than I ever have in my entire lifetime. <br/>
I&#39;ve come to an appreciation for them.  I see what my daughter sees in<br/>
them, what she likes and dislikes about each and everyone of them. <br/>
There are still some that I don&#39;t know that I&#39;ll ever appreciate and<br/>
that&#39;s ok.  I never would&#39;ve been able to make that distinction if I&#39;d<br/>
never delved into them.  I do not like sadistic torture movies.  I&#39;m<br/>
fine with slasher and gore and all kinds of chills and thrills, but<br/>
sadistic torture is way to hard for me to watch, so I pass on those.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t need to like everything your kids are into, what you need to<br/>
do, is be open and receptive to what they are into.  Be the mom they can<br/>
talk to about their passions and listen enough to have an intelligent<br/>
conversation about those passions.  If your daughter likes fashion, it<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean that you have to start accessorizing your own wardrobe, it<br/>
means making trips to the mall and window shopping, looking at fashion<br/>
magazines, watching &quot;what not to wear&quot;, people watching, thrift store<br/>
shopping, maybe even sewing.  Fashion is very interesting and has a lot<br/>
of history.  What people wear and when and why is very fascinating. <br/>
There are some really cool fashion books out there.  Along with the<br/>
underwear conversation, we also talked about cultural gender colors. <br/>
All of that is fashion.</div>

<br/>
That&#39;s not unusual at all!  If you aren&#39;t interested in something that<br/>
someone else is telling you, you&#39;d tune them out and politely nod your<br/>
head, or try really hard to hear what they are saying, simply to have it<br/>
all go out the other side of your brain.  I you want to have a<br/>
relationship with someone, find things in common, or find things the<br/>
other person is into, talk, explore, don&#39;t try to insert knowledge into<br/>
the other person.  You can&#39;t anyway, if we could do that to children,<br/>
then schools would have a 100% success rate.  Teachers learn all kinds<br/>
of tricks to get knowledge to &quot;stick&quot; long enough for kids to pass tests<br/>
to get enough funding to support their salaries.<br/>
<br/>
If I met someone in real life who tried to do that to me, and I have met<br/>
many, school teacher only being some of them, I don&#39;t tend to stick<br/>
around long enough to really get to know the person.  Your child is a<br/>
person, not unlike all the other people out there in the world.  Your<br/>
child is more precious to you than any other person in the world.  Don&#39;t<br/>
treat her as if you are bigger and better and more knowledgable, treat<br/>
her like you would a friend who you are intensely interested in getting<br/>
to know better.</div>

always didn&#39;t fit.  She has plenty of friends now, and plenty of people<br/>
that would like to be her friend, but sometimes she&#39;ll still choose my<br/>
company over them.  Even though it felt desperate at times, she&#39;s 15 and<br/>
isn&#39;t desperate, she&#39;s selective about who she lets into her life and<br/>
who she doesn&#39;t.  All it took was one available friend, just one, and<br/>
even though it didn&#39;t always last, having one friend at any given moment<br/>
in time allowed her to feel confident enough to meet other people.  Even<br/>
when she didn&#39;t have a friend available, she liked my company and spent<br/>
time with me.</div>

<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid my best friend and I lived as different people.  I was Alexandria Julianne Ramsay, AKA Alec.  We owned horse farms and raced in the major horse races.  We WERE these people, we played this game with model horses, bikes, pretend horses.  We rode horses to school (our bikes), we rode pretend horses around the neighborhood and playground, we raced them in the Kentucky Derby (I won once).  All this stemmed from the Black Stallion books.  We also read and reenacted Star Wars a dozen or more times.<br/>
<br/>
I did the same thing with TV.  I pretended I was in Battlestar Galactica (the original TV series), all kinds of pretend play.  There were other shows, of course, but I remember that one &#39;cause I saved up my money and bought a cardboard replica of the control system of a fighter to play with in my room.  <br/>
<br/>
My son pretends to be a Baby Blue Girl Kitty.  Last year it was more often and more intense, we called him by that name, I spoke to him in meows as well as human speech.  He has been a Spider Rider, Kung Fu Panda, the Avatar, pokemon, and more.  <br/>
<br/>
Now that I am grown up I do role playing games. I think of it as a way for me to try out different aspects of my personality that I do not get to access as much in daily life.  Seriously, how much use do I have for a Mobster or a Tesla-Welder wielding master lockpicker and thief in real life?  Not much, but they sure are fun to be for pretend.<br/>

they were WAY into pretending they were other people. I encouraged it - <br/>

re-invent clothes.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Just keep the kits - she&#39;ll probably come back to them for their contents <br/>
later.<br/>
<br/>
If you have a Swap-o-rama-rama in your area you might take her. There are <br/>
people that do cool redux stuff with clothes.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m currently writing a book about fashion upcycling and redux. There are <br/>
tons of websites by people doing that.<br/>
www.craftstylish.com is a good place to start.<br/>

&gt; &lt;I just had a thought of gathering up supplies and plain shirts and start<br/>
&gt; there with her imagination.Â I wonder what she would come up with.&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;Get out of your comfort zone - do some yourself. Have some fun.... Don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; expect to hand her supplies or kits and think she&#39;ll just do them alone.&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you can also explore www.etsy.com<br/>
there are alot of young stylists in there...and alot of ideas for<br/>
accessories and bags...its fun to explore with my children-we get tons of<br/>
ideas to do things together just from browsing.<br/>
<br/>
I have found it very true about the mamma needing to participate in new<br/>
activities<br/>
--especially is the relationship is a bit shaky--<br/>
for fear of being judged a child might not participate until she sees that<br/>
mamma is really enjoying herself.<br/>

harrass her because I feel she is watching to much tv.<br/>
=====================================<br/>
<br/>
For the purposes of this discussion, it doesn&#39;t matter what you meant;  <br/>
it matters what you said.  Once the words are out here, we can discuss  <br/>
the words.   It&#39;s a discussion list, not a support group, so what you  <br/>
put out is for the discussion and not about you anymore (not directly;  <br/>
not yours to take back).   Joyce described it perfectly once:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The list is about ideas, not about people.<br/>
Think of ideas like balls and the list like a ball court. If someone  <br/>
tosses an idea worth discussing into the court it&#39;s going to get  <br/>
batted about. At that point what&#39;s going on is no longer about the  <br/>
person who tossed the idea in. It&#39;s about the idea and how well and  <br/>
cleanly it&#39;s being tossed about. (Unless the tosser keeps jumping in  <br/>
and grabbing the idea ball saying &quot;Mine!&quot;)<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1487653886">A very sweet book with projects that make you want to dive right in is The Creative Family by unschooling mom Amanda Soule. <br/>

Her kids are younger, but my 10- and 16-year-old boys were inspired by some of the crafts. It&#39;s not fashion, exactly, but it can be a great springboard for stuff to do together.<br/>

I found two books on Amazon for Holly about altering t-shirts.  She  <br/>
had already been doing it, and I found some other examples.  She  <br/>
doesn&#39;t do things to the material of the shirts, she wraps and wears  <br/>
them different ways, or slashes or...   She did make a skirt of one,  <br/>
and made pockets of the sleeves.   There&#39;s a photo somewhere....<br/>
<br/>
And she wore one big t-shirt as a dress one day.<br/>
I&#39;&#39;ll put photos of Holly&#39;s altered clothes online here as I find  <br/>
them.  There might not be anything there if you read this right after  <br/>
it&#39;s posted.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
For that sort of thing, thrift stores would be a better source than  <br/>
new, plain-colored t-shirts would be.  Sometimes it needs the shirt to  <br/>
be way bigger than the girl, for having the extra material.<br/>
