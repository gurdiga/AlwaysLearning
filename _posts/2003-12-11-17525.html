Um...with a drill? lol<br/>
Seriously though, we used a regular cordless drill with a small bit and drilled many scallops for a windchime. I just made sure there was something solid behind the part I was drilling....it didn&#39;t take long at all.<br/>

Maybe the shells could be set in something like playdough (homemade or -doh <br/>
plastic bought stuff) so they&#39;re still and there&#39;s wood behind the drilling <br/>
point.  Some shell just won&#39;t be &quot;vised&quot; but maybe they could be gummed.   Or the <br/>
poster-sticking stuff.  That comes off easily too.<br/>
