A friend of Marty&#39;s (female, unschooled) who is 18 asked me if it would be <br/>
okay with me if she gets him a gift certificate for Castle Superstore for his <br/>
birthday Tuesday.  He&#39;s turning fourteen.  She wants to do it as a gag gift.  <br/>
 Castle Superstore is a VERY large porn shop, in the full size building of <br/>
what used to be Standard Brands Paint, which sold paint, flooring and art <br/>
supplies for most of my life.<br/>
<br/>
I was surprised 18 year olds could go in there, but she said they could.<br/>
<br/>
So I said I doubted the certificate would last until he was 18, and that he <br/>
would probably just be happy to put it on his wall, but he might want to send <br/>
someone to actually get him something before it expires.  She said SHE <br/>
wouldn&#39;t go get him something.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been in there.  There is a whole wall of dildos.  But the reason I went <br/>
in was to get a t-shirt for a friend in England who asked me to look for it <br/>
and it turned out that&#39;s the only store that had one.  It was Horton the <br/>
elephant sitting in a tree (I think) with money in his... hand [foot?] and <br/>
there was a very Dr.-Seuss-looking woman posing in a cartoon sexy pose, and <br/>
it said:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Horton Hires a Ho&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It was very strange being in that store, because it is SO big, you can&#39;t hide <br/>
like you can in a little dark little nasty-movie store (where I made Keith <br/>
take me once, but he wouldn&#39;t rent anything because he&#39;s shy and a little <br/>
prudish).    This is BRIGHT and OPEN and I&#39;m OLD and the fairly predominant <br/>
mother of Several Children.    <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like WalMart.<br/>

They have several of those stores here in Phoenix.<br/>
You&#39;re right, that store is the Walmart of sex stores.<br/>
I was very overwhelmed!<br/>
We didn&#39;t buy anything. But it was fun browsing. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
