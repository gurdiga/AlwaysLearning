<div id="ygrps-yiv-710672322">We rented a forest service cabin for the weekend, near the headwaters of<br/>
the Little Blackfoot river. <br/>
The Little Blackfoot is my husbands current favorite fly fishing river. <br/>
Mostly because it&#39;s the one we&#39;re closest to and he can get there easily<br/>
after work and fish for a few hours.   We get up near the headwaters<br/>
about once a year and camp, but we loaned our tent to David&#39;s sister and<br/>
it&#39;s in Germany now so we rented the cabin for three days and two nights.<br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
Dylan and I went up early Friday morning and got everything unpacked and<br/>
went for a hike.   We only intended to be gone for two hours or so but I<br/>
left my watch behind and we wandered back considerably later than I<br/>
intended.   David was there, having come up later after getting off work.<br/>
 We had late night round the campfire, watching the stars.  <br/>
<br/>
Saturday morning David went fishing and later reported he&#39;d caught every<br/>
brookie and cut throat in the river.  He lost one fly but gained a frog,<br/>
who attached himself to David&#39;s wader and didn&#39;t want to leave. <br/>
We had been watching a moose in the river that morning so David was<br/>
expecting to have some company while he fished.  He did see two moose and<br/>
maneuvered around them, but the frog was harder to avoid.<br/>
This is the river he was fishing two years ago when a bear chased him<br/>
into the water.  The bear gets bigger every time he tells the story, so<br/>
I&#39;m sure the frog will too. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
While David was fishing Dylan and I went hiking up the four wheeler trail<br/>
behind the cabin.   We saw elk and moose and evidence of bears but no<br/>
bears in person.  We kept hiking when we lost the trail and went to the<br/>
top of the mountain where we could look across to the west and see our<br/>
own mountain range, the Flint Creek range and beyond that the Sapphire<br/>
Mountains and the Garnet range to the north.   We found a great lodge<br/>
pole, misshapen by mistletoe, and ate our lunch under it in a sea of <br/>
blue lupine.   This great old tree was perfect for climbing, really<br/>
perfect, but I&#39;m not as good a tree climber as I used to be.  Come to<br/>
think of it I was never great.  I fell out of our big cottonwood when I<br/>
was five and broke my collar bone.  My mother had told me I&#39;d break my<br/>
neck someday and when I fell I was so mad that she had been right  I hid<br/>
from her for half a day before she found me whimpering under the bed with<br/>
my growing bruise and lumpy shoulder.   This lodge pole was a little like<br/>
that cotton wood and maybe I still had my mothers voice in my head<br/>
because I fell out of the tree.   I didn&#39;t break anything this time but I<br/>
must have bruised a rib because I&#39;m an interesting shade of yellowish<br/>
green today on my right side and it hurts if I breathe deeply.  <br/>
Dylan, it turns out, is a fearless tree and rock climber in spite of<br/>
seeing his old mother fall.   Because I&#39;d forgotten my compass and we&#39;d<br/>
gotten a little creative with our trail blazing we were temporarily<br/>
misplaced for a while and had to back track about a half mile before we<br/>
found our trail again.  The three hour hike back down to the cabin was<br/>
less fun than the hike up had been, but I ate some hot peppers and felt<br/>
better and moaned enough that David cooked for us while I lounged by the<br/>
campfire. &lt;g&gt;  Turns out I can spit a cherry pit cleanly twelve feet to<br/>
the back of the head of a smart ass husband.  I&#39;m continually amazed by<br/>
my own talents. <br/>
<br/>
We waited for the coyotes that night and when we couldn&#39;t wait any longer<br/>
we howled to get them started.  It worked too, and we had a howling<br/>
chorus for about twenty minutes.  We&#39;re easily amused, I guess. <br/>
<br/>
Dylan broke up a fight between two macho pine sawyer beetles.  It&#39;s<br/>
amazing how much power those little buggers have and how tough they are. <br/>
He&#39;d carry one away to a different log and it&#39;d fly back to engage in<br/>
combat with the other again.  Now we&#39;ll have to see if we can find out<br/>
why they fight, if it&#39;s territory or women or just the pine sawyer tough<br/>
man competition.  <br/>
<br/>
Sunday David left early to get ready for work and Dylan and I stayed to<br/>
play a little and investigate a different trail.  We&#39;re going up there<br/>
this week, or on the weekend to hike the Blackfoot meadows trail so maybe<br/>
we&#39;ll get back for the other, too.   I&#39;ve been up the Blackfoot meadows<br/>
trail but Dylan hasn&#39;t.  It&#39;s an eight hour hike if you don&#39;t dawdle<br/>
climbing trees.   I&#39;m not sure about the trail we found and started up<br/>
Sunday because I can&#39;t find it on the map but that&#39;s all the more reason<br/>
to see what&#39;s at the other end. <br/>
