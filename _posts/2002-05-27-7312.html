<div id="ygrps-yiv-1159401336">We have this old, sweet cat with kidney failure.  He gets sub cutaneous<br/>
fluids everyday and when we first started this treatment Dylan was<br/>
uncomfortable about it. He started reading about kidney function and<br/>
failure and the success rate of kidney transplants in cats, to try and<br/>
understand what was happening to our friend.   The first time we gave the<br/>
fluids,  he held the cat for me and he was nervous, but glad to help.  In<br/>
a few day&#39;s he was comforting the Mr. Fuzzy and holding him and the whole<br/>
operation was pretty slick and fast.  Then he asked if he could give the<br/>
fluids, and I showed him how and he did a fine job even though his hands<br/>
were shaking and the syringe was big.  He hasn&#39;t asked about giving the<br/>
fluids again, but now he knows he can if he has to and he knows something<br/>
new about himself, too.   He doesn&#39;t talk about it but it&#39;s all over him,<br/>
a confidence in the kind of person he is and the kind&#39;s of things he can<br/>
do.  <br/>
<br/>
And we&#39;ve been out hiking, bird watching, admiring the spring.   We took<br/>
a ride over the old stage coach road between Deer Lodge and Gold creek<br/>
and talked about history and elevation and tree growth and wild flowers. <br/>
We saw birds we never see in town, Mountain Bluebirds and Meadow Larks<br/>
and Wilson&#39;s Phalaropes.   We got a flat tire and Dylan learned how to<br/>
use the jack.  We ate lunch on a big rock and looked up to find three<br/>
white tail deer investigating us.  <br/>
We startled a Red Tailed hawk and found the Crow he was devouring.  He<br/>
had removed it&#39;s head and the feathers on its breast and already eaten<br/>
much of the innards.   We moved away some to see if he&#39;d come back but he<br/>
didn&#39;t.  We wondered who else might eat there after we were gone.   We<br/>
watched a Killdeer running on the mud flats of an old dredge pond,<br/>
darting around catching bugs and talked about how they will act wounded,<br/>
and try to lure you away if you come too close to a nest.  We never found<br/>
the nest, if there was one, or saw the mate, but we watched raptly as he<br/>
went about his business. <br/>
<br/>
At home we&#39;re digging out a new garden space and building a fence.  Dylan<br/>
helps some and then wanders down to the creek.  His shoes were soaked<br/>
yesterday when he came home but we got the report that there are frogs<br/>
and little fish and water bug galore.  He brought a smooth round rock to<br/>
mark the grave of a Cedar Wax wing we found dead in the road.  A Starling<br/>
crept through the vent in our attic and was roaming around under the eve<br/>
of our roof, inside the siding.  We wondered how we&#39;d ever get her out,<br/>
but after she&#39;d inspected everything she popped back out on her own. <br/>
Maybe she has plans to make a nest in there.  Last year we had bats, and<br/>
swore we&#39;d cover that vent, but here we are again with home invaders. <br/>
Dylan saw his first Western Tanager on Friday.  The list he keeps of<br/>
birds he can identify is getting fairly long.   <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had beautiful aurora&#39;s and have been up late watching the sky. <br/>
Jupiter and Venus are brilliant in the western horizon, and Dylan can<br/>
find some of the constellations, and makes up some of his own.   We made<br/>
marshmallows for our hot chocolate and now we sky watch in comfort.<br/>
<br/>
He cut his hair, he took a pet sitting job for four days,  he&#39;s building<br/>
a cat scratching post.  His friends still can&#39;t come and play because<br/>
they&#39;re counting down these last ten days of school.   In a few weeks the<br/>
county superintendent will call and ask where our attendance record is<br/>
and I&#39;ll march down there and give him the little piece of paper that<br/>
says Dylan was learning for 180 days. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1573968222">Deb, where you lives sounds so beautiful.  We live on a 10,000 sq. <br/>
ft. lot with people all around us.  Thank goodness we at least have <br/>
a narrow woods in our backyard that buffers us from the neighbors <br/>
behind us.<br/>
<br/>
Because of what I learned from a recent trip to a butterfly house, I <br/>
was able to spot caterpillar eggs on some leaves on one of the trees <br/>
in the woods.  There was a ladybug going from leaf to leaf, munching <br/>
away.<br/>
<br/>
There are little wonders of life we can see in the suburbs, that is <br/>
if my neighbors don&#39;t go crazy with the pesticides.<br/>
<br/>
I enjoy reading about your days.  Sorry to hear about your cat.<br/>
<br/>

seems happy right now and he&#39;s up and around everyday, enjoying sunny<br/>

He&#39;ll be seventeen in the fall, if he makes it that long, and when he&#39;s<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sorry about your cat Deb :-( <br/>
Thanks so much for the narratives on your days.  I really enjoy <br/>
reading them!  What prompted Dylan to cut his hair?<br/>
  <br/>
We&#39;ve been planting strawberries, sunflowers and herbs (that&#39;s <br/>
pronounced &#39;h&#39;erbs, because it&#39;s got a fucking H in it  -  courtesy <br/>
of Eddie Izzard &lt;g&gt;) the last few days.  We keep unearthing the <br/>
squirrels forgotten acorn stores.  We also found a dead mole at <br/>
the entrance to his hole, I think a cat got him.  <br/>
We&#39;re going to have a picnic today but it&#39;s very overcast, a bit <br/>
windy, and looks like rain.  We&#39;ll either picnic in the rain, or if it <br/>
gets really bad, we&#39;ll come back here and picnic on the front <br/>
porch.<br/>
We&#39;ve just finished building an island with a volcano on it for <br/>
Tamzin&#39;s dinosaurs.  We&#39;re going to erupt the volcano in a <br/>
couple of days (when the papier mache and varnish is dry).  She <br/>
wants to make sure the lava flows over some of the dinos so <br/>
they can get fossilized &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
We got a pair of $2.00 roller skates (almost new!) at a garage <br/>
sale on Friday and she&#39;s been skating around the house and up <br/>
and down the front porch since then.  She tried skating on the <br/>
back patio, but Angel (one of our dogs) was too intent on chasing <br/>
after her &lt;g&gt;.  I think I&#39;ll take her to an empty parking lot or <br/>
somewhere else to skate today as well as the picnic.<br/>
I&#39;ve started a cleaning business!  It&#39;s called Natural Enviroment <br/>
Cleaning Service.  I only use natural products, most of which I <br/>
make myself.  If anyone has any recipes for citrus based natural <br/>
cleaners I&#39;d appreciate if you could pass them onto me, I&#39;ve yet to <br/>
find a citrus based formula that I like.  I&#39;m also thinking about <br/>
selling the cleaning products I make to my customers, but that&#39;s <br/>
still in the planning stages.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I would love to find a citrus cleaner that is powerful and easy to use<br/>
safely.<br/>
<br/>
However,<br/>
<br/>
I am very wary of citrus cleaners. One of my many various responsibilities<br/>
is keeping our MSDS book up to date for the shop and backstage areas. It&#39;s<br/>
an OSHA regulation. Most citrus based cleaners, natural or un, have much<br/>
stricter storage, handling, and use procedures than most of the other<br/>
cleaning products we use.  The natural variety often contain all of the very<br/>
powerful insecticides that protect the fruit from infestation while growing,<br/>
in a concentration that make them difficult to handle in every day use,<br/>
because you have to use respirators and complete barriers to the skin.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m away on vacation now and can&#39;t get to my materials, but I believe this<br/>
class of cleaner has been linked to infertility and miscarriage, at small<br/>
exposures for long periods of time.  I&#39;m remembering from a workshop that<br/>
this was the class of chemicals in the air at either an IBM or Xerox<br/>
factory, at a very small level where there was four times the number of<br/>
miscarriages above the norm.  409 has them too, so I think we&#39;re all back to<br/>
water and baking soda.  If you&#39;re interested, I&#39;ll be glad to look all this<br/>
up and site it more specifically when I get back (and get caught up).<br/>
<br/>
As one of my favorite industrial hygienist says &quot;Natural has no relation to<br/>
safety.&quot; and &quot;Take these words out of your vocabulary: Safe and Non Toxic.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1089108612">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt; I would love to find a citrus cleaner that is powerful and <br/>
easy to use safely.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; However,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am very wary of citrus cleaners. One of my many various <br/>
 </span></blockquote>responsibilities is keeping our MSDS book up to date for the <br/>
shop and backstage areas. It&#39;s an OSHA regulation. Most citrus <br/>
based cleaners, natural or un, have much stricter storage, <br/>
handling, and use procedures than most of the other cleaning <br/>
products we use.  The natural variety often contain all of the very <br/>
powerful insecticides that protect the fruit from infestation while <br/>
growing, in a concentration that make them difficult to handle in <br/>
every day use, because you have to use respirators and <br/>
complete barriers to the skin.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m away on vacation now and can&#39;t get to my materials, but I <br/>
 </span></blockquote>believe this class of cleaner has been linked to infertility and <br/>
miscarriage, at small exposures for long periods of time.  I&#39;m <br/>
remembering from a workshop that this was the class of <br/>
chemicals in the air at either an IBM or Xerox factory, at a very <br/>
small level where there was four times the number of <br/>
miscarriages above the norm.  409 has them too, so I think we&#39;re <br/>
all back to water and baking soda.  If you&#39;re interested, I&#39;ll be glad <br/>
to look all this up and site it more specifically when I get back <br/>
(and get caught up).<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; As one of my favorite industrial hygienist says &quot;Natural has no <br/>
 </span></blockquote>relation to safety.&quot; and &quot;Take these words out of your vocabulary: <br/>
Safe and Non Toxic.&quot;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; -Dan<br/>
&gt; This is not the part of my job that gets me going in the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>mornings :-)&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the info Dan.  I&#39;d love more when you get home.  Most <br/>
of my cleaners are baking soda and vinegar based.  I use <br/>
castille soap and washing soda as a base for my laundry soap <br/>
and multi-purpose cleaner.  I add herbal infusions and/or <br/>
essential oils in small amounts (like tea tree, lemon and <br/>
lavender) .<br/>
