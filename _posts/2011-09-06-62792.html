<div id="ygrps-yiv-442158370">Hello everybody,<br/>
 <br/>
I have been on this list for over a year now and I am on the path of unschooling my three kids.  Today I am writing you about my daughter who is seven and has never been to school.  In June when I asked her if she was happy at home or wanted to go to school, she said that she wanted to be home.  She also said that school was boring and you had to sit for so long listening to a mean teacher.  I was glad that she had resolved the issue because we had this conversation before.  All summer they were playing with their friends in the neighboorhood for the whole day and know she wants to try it.  So I am willing to let her go.<br/>
 <br/>
But at the same time I am thinking that I might not have made the house fun for her.  She has been wanting to play more online games.  I have been looking but I can not find exactly what she wants.  She would like something that would involve dress up, hair cuts, make up, cooking.  We have found some cooking games on the ipad that she likes but I was wondering what other girls play.  She also loves to play with her baby dolls and everything that involves a baby.<br/>
 <br/>
A while back Meredith had posted how her daughter loved playing with the regular dishes for tea party instead of the kids one.  Before that I never thought about letting my daughter do that or even give her the idea.  It was just something that never crossed my mind.  When I gave her the idea she went through a phase of that and it was great I was happy for her.  She still does it once in a while.  <br/>
 <br/>
It is ideas like this that I am looking for.<br/>
 <br/>
Thank you,<br/>
 <br/>
Fatim <br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
Why use the phrase &quot;went through a phase&quot;?  She did something fun, more than once!  It was real.  <br/>
If you can see what she does as glorious instead of not having lasted long enough, that will add to your happiness without changing what&#39;s happening, just what you see of it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-... is seven and has never been to school. In June when I asked her if she was happy at home or wanted to go to school, she said that she wanted to be home. She also said that school was boring and you had to sit for so long listening to a mean teacher. -=-<br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;s seven, and you don&#39;t think you&#39;re doing enough to make the house fun, and if she thinks school is sitting and listening to a mean teacher, that sounds like a lot of negativity surrounds the whole situation.  <br/>
<br/>
-= I was glad that she had resolved the issue because we had this conversation before.-=-<br/>
<br/>
How it is an issue resolved, if she&#39;s afraid of school but home is boring? I know I&#39;m not answering the question about current online games for young girls.  I only know of online games years ago. What I want to write about it the tone of the story.  Too dark to be joyful.  <br/>
<br/>
Even though she&#39;s seven, there might be ideas here she would like:<br/>

At thrift stores you might look in the baby sections and get real baby clothes for her dolls, if the dolls are big enough.  Baby socks, baby caps.  Or at garage sales.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-17451535">Noor just turned 8, and she isn&#39;t into many &quot;girly&quot; things, but she likes Jump Start because of the ability to dress up and change her character&#39;s appearance.  She loves raising &quot;mythies&quot; dragons and such in the game.  There is an &quot;educational&quot; component to the game, where you play math/reading games to earn coins, so that may be something to consider if you want to give her space away from that kind of thing--you could always play the coin-earning games for her, or with her, which is what we do here sometimes. <br/>
<br/>
She also likes the website Armor games: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://armorgames.com/">http://armorgames.com/</a> <br/>
all of them are free<br/>
<br/>
If you have space, cardboard boxes are great for building all kinds of set ups--she could build a nursery, or furniture for her babies, or anything, really--a fort......<br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;s into crafty things, collect fabric scraps, save recyclable containers, egg cartons, etc....pom-poms, popsicle sticks, google eyes, glitter, craft foam, aluminum foil, duct tape, air-dry clay, craft glue and a glue gun....keep these things easily accessible so she can use them to make props for her play or to decorate things, make new toys, etc...<br/>
<br/>
If your climate and housing permits, setting up a mud kitchen may be something she&#39;d enjoy. Gather up old baking dishes, pie plates, colanders, muffin tins, bowls, utensils, pots and pans and set up an area of the yard as a &quot;kitchen&quot;. Ours also has a cabinet that is periodically stocked with things like dried plants/herbs/spices, some cheap vegetable oil, food coloring, baking soda, white vinegar, dish soap, jars, and containers for mixing potions.<br/>

This has been my daughter&#39;s favorite dress up site for a long time now:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dressupgames.com/">http://www.dressupgames.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s sweet about that site, for me at least, is that Margaux found it on her own doing google searches and because her much older sister had been at the site once or twice, it popped up in the search ahead of other things.<br/>
<br/>
There are also mom and baby things there, or just baby things, or pregnant mom things.  It&#39;s updated all the time, so every time you go there, there are new things to check out.  Margaux uses it at least once a week for many hours and has been for the last 3 yrs.<br/>

Jump Start has downloadable games for members.  The first month is $4.99, so you could join for a month and then cancel. It goes up to $7/month after that.<br/>

&gt; Hello everybody,<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I have been on this list for over a year now and I am on the path of unschooling my three kids.  Today I am writing you about my daughter who is seven and has never been to school.  In June when I asked her if she was happy at home or wanted to go to school, she said that she wanted to be home.  She also said that school was boring and you had to sit for so long listening to a mean teacher.  I was glad that she had resolved the issue because we had this conversation before.  All summer they were playing with their friends in the neighboorhood for the whole day and know she wants to try it.  So I am willing to let her go.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; But at the same time I am thinking that I might not have made the house fun for her.  She has been wanting to play more online games.  I have been looking but I can not find exactly what she wants.  She would like something that would involve dress up, hair cuts, make up, cooking.  We have found some cooking games on the ipad that she likes but I was wondering what other girls play.  She also loves to play with her baby dolls and everything that involves a baby.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; A while back Meredith had posted how her daughter loved playing with the regular dishes for tea party instead of the kids one.  Before that I never thought about letting my daughter do that or even give her the idea.  It was just something that never crossed my mind.  When I gave her the idea she went through a phase of that and it was great I was happy for her.  She still does it once in a while.  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; It is ideas like this that I am looking for.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Thank you,<br/>

search<br/>
 &quot;dress up games for girls&quot;, add in &#39;potions&#39; and &#39;Sue&#39; and any other <br/>
key words you want to relate to the games. Most of it is in a foreign <br/>
language andI could barely figure them out, but she whizzed right <br/>
through them. Tomorrow I will ask her what the rest of them are as she <br/>
still has her games listed somewhere. Webkinz is cool too(if you buy a <br/>
webkinz, she likes that alot as well. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-563103353">Depending on what she likes, you might have more options moving to a different platform - either a console system (PS, Wii, Xbox) or a hand held system like the DS. There are a Lot more games for those than there are for computers with a much wider range of appeal. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1108571277">Annabel is nearly 8, and she has been enjoying the following online games lately:<br/>
<br/>
* Plants VS Zombies, the web games (especially the avatar creator) and the downloadable version: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.popcap.com/extras/pvz/?">http://www.popcap.com/extras/pvz/?</a><br/>
<br/>
* Club Penguin: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://play.clubpenguin.com/">http://play.clubpenguin.com/</a> - fun, but not a lot of features on the free account - we have paid for it a few times but she doesn&#39;t think it is worth it anymore.<br/>
<br/>
* Build-a-BearVille: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bearville.com/">http://www.bearville.com/</a> - we both have accounts here and like to meet on the same server to visit each others &quot;condos&quot; :)<br/>
<br/>
* Minecraft. The all-time hands-down winner for her, she can&#39;t wait for one-point-eight. The pigs will have snouts! (speaking of minecraft, are there any unschooling kid-friendly servers that you all know of?) :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2012295884">Hi,<br/>
I don&#39;t know if you have and iPod, iPhone or iPad, but there is a really cool free app called Pucca&#39;s Restaurant. Pucca is an animated 10 year old girl in a South Korean cartoon. My 6 year old son found episodes on Netflix streaming. He then asked to find YouTube stuff on it and found out through that about various Pucca apps.<br/>
<br/>
I know you have a 7 year old girl, but I started playing the game myself and i love it. I do this when he finds something new because he gets totally, utterly immersed in whatever his new thing is and if I don&#39;t check it out pretty thoroughly, within a week of finding something new, it is like he is speaking another language and he talks constantly about whatever he is into and then it drives me crazy. So, to mitigate that, I try to learn about it too, so I can understand what he is talking about! And sometimes, I love it as much as he does. Pucca doesn&#39;t have a lot of instruction, so you have to muddle through initially.<br/>
<br/>
Another unschooling mom I know introduced my to another app called Tiny Tower, which is really cool, but requires some reading.<br/>

&gt; Hello everybody,<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I have been on this list for over a year now and I am on the path of unschooling my three kids.  Today I am writing you about my daughter who is seven and has never been to school.  In June when I asked her if she was happy at home or wanted to go to school, she said that she wanted to be home.  She also said that school was boring and you had to sit for so long listening to a mean teacher.  I was glad that she had resolved the issue because we had this conversation before.  All summer they were playing with their friends in the neighboorhood for the whole day and know she wants to try it.  So I am willing to let her go.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; But at the same time I am thinking that I might not have made the house fun for her.  She has been wanting to play more online games.  I have been looking but I can not find exactly what she wants.  She would like something that would involve dress up, hair cuts, make up, cooking.  We have found some cooking games on the ipad that she likes but I was wondering what other girls play.  She also loves to play with her baby dolls and everything that involves a baby.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; A while back Meredith had posted how her daughter loved playing with the regular dishes for tea party instead of the kids one.  Before that I never thought about letting my daughter do that or even give her the idea.  It was just something that never crossed my mind.  When I gave her the idea she went through a phase of that and it was great I was happy for her.  She still does it once in a while.  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; It is ideas like this that I am looking for.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Thank you,<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Fatim <br/>
