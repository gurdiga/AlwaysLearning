 </span></blockquote>This is a chance to throw something in there about fractions. There IS a <br/>
median, of course, it is halfway between 5 and 6 so she could say 5 1/2 if <br/>
she wants to be right in the middle on a scale of 1 to 10.  The good thing <br/>
about talking about fractions like this is that most people ONLY talk to kids <br/>
about fractions as &quot;parts of a whole&quot; (a slice of pizza) and in this case it <br/>
isn&#39;t part of a &quot;thing&quot; -- but something much less concrete. You could think <br/>
of it as part of a distance - if you have numberlines in your head - but that <br/>
isn&#39;t going to be obvious to Lexie when she&#39;s holding up her fingers. Good <br/>
opportunity to NOT get her stuck on thinking of fractions in the piece of a <br/>
pie way. This can be a handicap, later, when we need to think of fractions as <br/>
other things like probabilities and odds, ratios, division problems, and so <br/>
on.<br/>

Pizza is infinite that way.  There&#39;s a half a pizza, but there&#39;s always a <br/>
half of that, and a half a piece, and a half a bite, and a half a pepperoni...<br/>
<br/>
And maybe if cheese were melted thin enough it would be infinite.  If all the <br/>
cheese in the world were melted on one (really) big surface, maybe it could <br/>
cover the moon.<br/>
