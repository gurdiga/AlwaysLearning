&gt;How old?  I missed that I guess. If she&#39;s bothered<br/>
&gt;because people (parents) are telling her she&#39;s <br/>
&gt;spelling stuff wrong then maybe that just needs to<br/>
&gt;stop. If she&#39;s bothered because she really wants to<br/>
&gt;spell well for her own reasons, then I&#39;d ask how I<br/>
&gt;could help.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The child is 12.  We don&#39;t care about spelling, but<br/>
grandparents, neighbors, etc. do say something. It<br/>
makes my niece uncomfortable.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Looking up correct spelling does make a difference.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It doesn&#39;t seem to in my niece&#39;s case. &lt;grin&gt; We gave<br/>
her a Franklin speller.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;***  But I don&#39;t get a sense of kids with lots of<br/>
&gt;&gt;depth and breadth who are unschooling. I know there<br/>
&gt;&gt;are wonderful unschooling kids out there who do all<br/>
&gt;&gt;kinds of things, but they aren&#39;t the typical kids I<br/>
&gt;&gt;have met.***<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Now I&#39;m lost.   You are interested in unschooling but<br/>
&gt;the unschoolers you know are shallow and ignorant? <br/>
&gt;Which of those things sparked your interest?&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, Deb, I can see that my email might sound very<br/>
negative now that I have re-read it! LOL. I guess the<br/>
articles and books I have read is what got me<br/>
interested.  And this email list!  In theory<br/>
unschooling sounds wonderful!  <br/>
<br/>
But please don&#39;t throw tomatoes...I just haven&#39;t been<br/>
around kids who come from families who say they<br/>
unschool who are like the ones described on this list<br/>
and in the articles and books.  I know people aren&#39;t<br/>
making up stories, but I guess I was sharing my<br/>
fear...that if I go all the way with unschooling that<br/>
maybe my kids won&#39;t have depth and breadth either. The<br/>
unschooling kids I have met don&#39;t have depth and<br/>
breadth. The kids seem real physical and end up in<br/>
fights and stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
I was excited to hear about a conference in Columbia<br/>
so I can see more variety of unschoolers.  Maybe I am<br/>
meeting a lot of non-schoolers?<br/>
<br/>
You might roll your eyes when I tell you this...but<br/>
the kids who do seem to have extraordinary depth and<br/>
breadth are kids who are Christian classical education<br/>
homeschoolers.  I don&#39;t know a word of Latin, and<br/>
theology is a TOTAL bore to me, so the method and<br/>
curriculum doesn&#39;t attract me at all. Not at all!! But<br/>
the kids all seem very well-read, have good social<br/>
skills, and good academic skills in general. They seem<br/>
to have developed real interests beyond video games<br/>
and sports.  I have nothing in common with the moms,<br/>
so I could never join their support group. <br/>
<br/>
So, I guess I have been wanting to discuss this<br/>
because I have been confused...and it wasn&#39;t my<br/>
intention to insult anyone&#39;s method of homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for writing,<br/>

These children are not made to learn anything they don&#39;t choose, so there is <br/>
such a variety of interests.  Neither of my boys is into sports.  They do like <br/>
computer and video games but also are into medieval times, knights and <br/>
castles etc,  anything to do with nature, animals, gardening, lizards (we have a <br/>
fair number of pets), robots, dinosaurs, Ancient Egypt, space, mythology ... at <br/>
least right now those are some of their interests.  It can and probably will <br/>
change tomorrow.  They can and do hold conversations with adults.  That is part <br/>
of their world.  They go with me grocery shopping, to the post office etc.  <br/>
You may not have contact with many unschoolers in your area.  I know there are <br/>
only 2 other families in my area and I only met them recently.  Before that I <br/>
was a loner around here and thought of as the &quot;alien.&quot;  LOL.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway your exposure may be limited so I do encourage you to attend the <br/>
conference if you can.  It is a wonderful experience.<br/>
