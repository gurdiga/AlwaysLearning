<div id="ygrps-yiv-1320675579">I don&#39;t know if this will help or not, but when my son was about 3, he started to stutter.  He hadn&#39;t started talking as early as some children do, and I probably wouldn&#39;t have been bothered by that if other people hadn&#39;t said things that made me feel that something was wrong.  (Things like &quot;well you know, my daughter was talking at 6 months&quot;).  <br/>
   <br/>
  Well, the last straw was my mother-in-law.  She started telling me about all the children she knew or ever had known, and about how what I needed to do was have my son evaluated and start speech therapy as soon as possible, because the longer I waited the worse it would get and so on and so on.  By the way, she said these things in front of my son, which made me furious, even though I normally get along with her quite well.  Since she was a nurse, I paid attention to what she said, but I felt in my gut that she was wrong.  I did some internet research, and discovered that what my son was doing was normal, and he did not exhibit all of the signs of having a real problem.  Basically, his vocabulary was increasing faster than his tongue was able to pronounce the words, and he was trying to speak faster than he was able.  He is 9 now, and has no problem whatsoever.  <br/>
   <br/>
  One thing I read that may help you is that if you sense a speech issue, you should try to speak in a little slower pace, and speak very distinctly to your child. (Think about the way Mr. Rogers spoke).  Not unusually slow, but not as fast as maybe you normally speak.  It sounds as though your son is trying to say things and he knows what he is saying, it&#39;s just hard for you and others to understand.  Personally, I feel that this will work itself out over time, but I know how frustrating it is right now (especially dealing with others).  As long as you know that he understands you, and you are patient in trying to understand him, his ability to communicate will improve.  If however, you sense that a hearing problem is involved, or after some time passes you don&#39;t sense any improvement, by all means seek out professional opinions from more than one source.  Go with your gut feeling--you&#39;re the mom.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1029429159">My dd, now 12, didn&#39;t use speech much until she was past 3. She had lots of<br/>
signing of her own making for what she needed plus, as she talked more, her<br/>
own words for things. My La Leche League leader counseled patience. I also<br/>
read a book by Thomas Sowell called &quot;Late Talking Children&quot; and did some<br/>
other research.  It helped to allay any fears I had.  She talks just fine<br/>
now with quite a large vocabulary (and at length sometimes &lt;g&gt;) and has for<br/>
many years.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Fluent reading came later for her than the expected-in-school timeline.<br/>
After the speech experience, I didn&#39;t worry.  She learned in her own time,<br/>
in her own way, after being surrounded by words in most of what she did.  In<br/>
the meantime, for both &quot;skills&quot;, I interpreted for her, by letting others<br/>
know what she was saying/wanting and reading things to her or helping her<br/>
read something if she wanted the help.  It was my job, as her advocate, to<br/>
do so. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I would wait it out, based on my experience.  I would read everything<br/>
possible that counters the interventionists to see if anything resonates.  I<br/>
would take a deep breath and sweetly help him in his interactions<br/>
until/unless I could see that it&#39;s a problem for *him*.  Then, I would<br/>
revisit the interventions.  I don&#39;t think it would be too late to wait six<br/>
months, a year even.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a very important point, as far as I&#39;m concerned, to do<br/>
something only when it starts to bother your DS.<br/>
<br/>
When my daughter was 2.5 my Mom started worrying she might need help<br/>
with speech.  Unfortunately her grandmotherly concern did lead to much<br/>
extra worrying on my part. <br/>
<br/>
My daughter was hard to understand, and after she turned 3 her spoken<br/>
vocabulary exploded. I made a conscious decision to very carefully<br/>
listen to her and try to always understand each word she was saying,<br/>
so I could better understand her. I got to a 90+% comprehension with<br/>
her, but by the time she was four the rest of the world probably got<br/>
less than 50% of what she said. <br/>
<br/>
When I tried working with her at 3.5, with shaping her mouth properly<br/>
to fix some of the pronunciation difficulties, she would just get mad<br/>
at me, and insist she was getting the sound right. She wasn&#39;t ready<br/>
for intervention at that point. <br/>
<br/>
At four I could see how frustrated she was when people didn&#39;t get what<br/>
she was trying to tell them.  And she wanted to talk to people<br/>
directly, not have me do it for her. I asked her if she wanted to go<br/>
to someone who could help her speak so that people could understand<br/>
her better. She was very eager to try this.<br/>
<br/>
It took about three months of effort on both our parts (I dropped the<br/>
therapist after two months) for her to overcome her speech problems.<br/>
She did not have a physical problem, and I suppose it may be important<br/>
to start earlier if there is a physical problem (I don&#39;t know). For us<br/>
waiting till my daughter was 4yrs was really useful. She *wanted* the<br/>
help by that point, so she progressed very quickly. <br/>
<br/>
BTW, it was only *after* we were getting the help for my DD that my<br/>
MIL casually mentioned how my DH had to get help to pronounce his &quot;S&quot;<br/>
sounds when he was about my DD&#39;s age.<br/>
<br/>
Also, there is lots of help online. Sites for games and sharing<br/>
resources. Try the keyword &quot;articulation&quot;. The link below was one of<br/>
mine and my daughter&#39;s favorite sites for speech games.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-839513201">Ah, yes. The old &quot;my daughter was walking at 6 months&quot; ploy.<br/>
<br/>
If my experience is anything to go by, most people who tell you when <br/>
your child &#39;should&#39; be doing something really don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
I had a friend in the UK whose son didn&#39;t say a word until he was <br/>
three. Then he started talking in complete sentences.<br/>
<br/>
My son was three when we came to Australia from London. Not long <br/>
after he started school a couple of years later, his teacher <br/>
recommended that I should take him to a speech therapist because he <br/>
wasn&#39;t pronouncing certain consonants &#39;correctly&#39;. One apparent <br/>
problem was &#39;f&#39; instead of &#39;th&#39;. The reason for that was my son was <br/>
born a &#39;cockney&#39; (think of the initial Eliza Doolittle in My Fair <br/>
Lady). So was I, and I grew up in that culture. I lost my cockney <br/>
accent long ago (although it does still occasionally re-emerge - <br/>
especially when I &#39;put it on&#39;), but my then six year old son had <br/>
spent the first three and a half years of his life surrounded by <br/>
street language that dropped its aitches at the beginning of words, <br/>
and its gees at the end of words, and &#39;free&#39; was what came <br/>
after &quot;one, two ...&quot; - and that had sunk in. Intelligibility wasn&#39;t <br/>
an issue. My son&#39;s speech was perfectly intelligible. So I took the <br/>
form about speech therapy from my son&#39;s teacher, promised I would <br/>
take the necessary action and chucked it in the bin when I got home. <br/>
Five years on, my son has a very interesting Australian-American <br/>
accent that&#39;s all his own and he communicates his ideas perfectly <br/>
clearly.<br/>
<br/>
He also had special words of his own when he was a toddler, some of <br/>
which persisted until he was about five or six. &#39;Winoon&#39; for <br/>
window; &#39;moonix&#39; for music, are two I particularly remember. And, <br/>
would you adam and eve it, after my son eventually replaced these <br/>
words with the &#39;real words&#39; of his own accord, my mother-in-law said <br/>
one day &quot;Oh, he was so sweet when used to say moonix&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with you. This is an area of child development where I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t put much faith in what self-appointed &#39;experts&#39; think they <br/>
know.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-906820044">I just wanted to say thank you for these e-mails on this subject.  My four year old struggles with saying his Ss and Im sure there are a few more sounds that he hasnt quite gotten the nack of tucked in there some where I just havent noticed them as much.  : )   I have had some good hearted people share that we should have him go to a speech specialist.  But at the time him seemed so young he had just turned three.  I have been hoping that he would work through it on his own.  But my husband has been starting to feel that we should do something more seriously now that he has turned four.  So thanks for the ideas and thought that have been shared they have been really helpful even though I wasnt the one with the original question : )<br/>

-------------- Original message -------------- <br/>
From: &quot;Bob Collier&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:bobcollier@...">bobcollier@...</a>&gt; <br/>
Ah, yes. The old &quot;my daughter was walking at 6 months&quot; ploy.<br/>
<br/>
If my experience is anything to go by, most people who tell you when <br/>
your child &#39;should&#39; be doing something really don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
I had a friend in the UK whose son didn&#39;t say a word until he was <br/>
three. Then he started talking in complete sentences.<br/>
<br/>
My son was three when we came to Australia from London. Not long <br/>
after he started school a couple of years later, his teacher <br/>
recommended that I should take him to a speech therapist because he <br/>
wasn&#39;t pronouncing certain consonants &#39;correctly&#39;. One apparent <br/>
problem was &#39;f&#39; instead of &#39;th&#39;. The reason for that was my son was <br/>
born a &#39;cockney&#39; (think of the initial Eliza Doolittle in My Fair <br/>
Lady). So was I, and I grew up in that culture. I lost my cockney <br/>
accent long ago (although it does still occasionally re-emerge - <br/>
especially when I &#39;put it on&#39;), but my then six year old son had <br/>
spent the first three and a half years of his life surrounded by <br/>
street language that dropped its aitches at the beginning of words, <br/>
and its gees at the end of words, and &#39;free&#39; was what came <br/>
after &quot;one, two ...&quot; - and that had sunk in. Intelligibility wasn&#39;t <br/>
an issue. My son&#39;s speech was perfectly intelligible. So I took the <br/>
form about speech therapy from my son&#39;s teacher, promised I would <br/>
take the necessary action and chucked it in the bin when I got home. <br/>
Five years on, my son has a very interesting Australian-American <br/>
accent that&#39;s all his own and he communicates his ideas perfectly <br/>
clearly.<br/>
<br/>
He also had special words of his own when he was a toddler, some of <br/>
which persisted until he was about five or six. &#39;Winoon&#39; for <br/>
window; &#39;moonix&#39; for music, are two I particularly remember. And, <br/>
would you adam and eve it, after my son eventually replaced these <br/>
words with the &#39;real words&#39; of his own accord, my mother-in-law said <br/>
one day &quot;Oh, he was so sweet when used to say moonix&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with you. This is an area of child development where I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t put much faith in what self-appointed &#39;experts&#39; think they <br/>
know.<br/>

children do, and I probably wouldn&#39;t have been bothered by that if <br/>
other people hadn&#39;t said things that made me feel that something was <br/>
wrong. (Things like &quot;well you know, my daughter was talking at 6 <br/>
months&quot;). <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

what I needed to do was have my son evaluated and start speech <br/>
therapy as soon as possible, because the longer I waited the worse it <br/>
would get and so on and so on. By the way, she said these things in <br/>
front of my son, which made me furious, even though I normally get <br/>
along with her quite well. Since she was a nurse, I paid attention <br/>
to what she said, but I felt in my gut that she was wrong. I did <br/>
some internet research, and discovered that what my son was doing was <br/>
normal, and he did not exhibit all of the signs of having a real <br/>
problem. Basically, his vocabulary was increasing faster than his <br/>
tongue was able to pronounce the words, and he was trying to speak <br/>
faster than he was able. He is 9 now, and has no problem <br/>
whatsoever. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; One thing I read that may help you is that if you sense a speech <br/>
 </span></blockquote>issue, you should try to speak in a little slower pace, and speak <br/>
very distinctly to your child. (Think about the way Mr. Rogers <br/>
spoke). Not unusually slow, but not as fast as maybe you normally <br/>
speak. It sounds as though your son is trying to say things and he <br/>
knows what he is saying, it&#39;s just hard for you and others to <br/>
understand. Personally, I feel that this will work itself out over <br/>
time, but I know how frustrating it is right now (especially dealing <br/>
with others). As long as you know that he understands you, and you <br/>
are patient in trying to understand him, his ability to communicate <br/>
will improve. If however, you sense that a hearing problem is <br/>
involved, or after some time passes you don&#39;t sense any improvement, <br/>
by all means seek out professional opinions from more than one <br/>
source. Go with your gut feeling--you&#39;re the mom.<br/>

customer reviews (especially the 1st one) on Amazon.com, I probably wouldn&#39;t<br/>
have.  It sounds like it would, however, be a counterpoint to Thomas<br/>
Sowell&#39;s book.  I see he has a follow-up book &quot;The Einstein Syndrome: Bright<br/>
Children Who Talk Late.&quot;<br/>

Thank you for the book reference.  I have requested a copy from our library.<br/>
<br/>
In looking for that book I found this book and am wondering if you have read<br/>
<br/>
it and what your thoughts are: The late talker: what to do if your child<br/>
<br/>
isn&#39;t talking yet, by M.C. Agin, L.F. Geng, and M.J. Nicholl.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-824977261">Someone I&#39;ve known since he was two is a marine now.  He really  <br/>
wanted to be a marine, but because he was unschooled, he had to take  <br/>
fifteen hours of college credit.  He did that; did well.<br/>
<br/>
He couldn&#39;t speak very intelligibly until he was four or five.<br/>
He didn&#39;t read until he was fifteen, but went straight to novels.<br/>
<br/>
If you met him and twenty other marines now and didn&#39;t know which one  <br/>
he was, you would not be able to tell which one he was.  The other  <br/>
nineteen might&#39;ve read at two, or five, or eight, and might have been  <br/>
speaking well at a year old.<br/>
<br/>
And so what?<br/>
<br/>
Same kid had a twin sister.  She was &quot;ahead&quot; of him.  &quot;Ahead&quot; in some  <br/>
ways, but not in all ways.  He&#39;s nicer, he can kick her ass (and  <br/>
needed to sometimes when they were growing up, because he was so much  <br/>
nicer, and for many years he was smaller&lt;bwg&gt;).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1339477932">My now 13 yo was pretty unintelligible till he was 6. I interpreted most of<br/>
the time, and if he was somewhere else where I wasn&#39;t, I would occasionally<br/>
get a phone call asking to interpret. He seemed to roll with all of that. I<br/>
never saw distress from him about his speech. He was mostly around kind<br/>
people, so he wasn&#39;t getting teased. I made sure of that.<br/>
<br/>
When he was 8, he still had a speech impediment, though he could be<br/>
understood most all of the time. He asked if there was someone who helps<br/>
speech. That&#39;s when we looked into speech therapy. He went for about 7<br/>
months and then said he didn&#39;t want to anymore (though he did feel some<br/>
guilt in not going anymore...he worried that the therapist would think he<br/>
was dissing her, lol).<br/>
<br/>
Today he still has a bit of a speech quirk. &quot;R&quot;s have always been the big<br/>
hurdle. He learned some exercises and chooses to do them sometimes. Mostly<br/>
though, real life provides the most practice. He just played Captain Hook in<br/>
a local production of Peter Pan. He worked very hard on pronunciation of the<br/>
script. THAT was great speech therapy, with great incentive.<br/>
<br/>
And, of course, he was the most amazing Captain Hook there ever was on a<br/>
stage :o) Played him like Johnny Depp in Pirates of the Caribbean.<br/>
