<div id="ygrps-yiv-723287832">I came across a video today about a 10-year-old girl who completed an<br/>
on-line degree (took her 8 months) to become a certified veterinary<br/>
assistant, and now she volunteers once a week at her local vet clinic<br/>
doing exactly that.  <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the link to the article - <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.komotv.com/news/14848331.html">http://www.komotv.com/news/14848331.html</a> <br/>
<br/>
And the link to the video - A younger, female Doogie Howser:  <br/>

<br/>
I found this to be a truly inspirational story.  My immediate thoughts<br/>
were that I want my child to have the freedom to study something he<br/>
loves in-depth and practice it in a meaningful way to him.  What a<br/>
wonderful gift to my child!  <br/>
<br/>
I sent this video clip to my niece who is 13.  She stated a couple<br/>
years ago that she wanted to be a veterinarian &quot;when she grew up&quot;<br/>
because she loves animals.  But her parents resonded by telling her<br/>
the &quot;gross&quot; parts of the job, and so she then said she wasn&#39;t sure she<br/>
could do that.  I was so sad.  She really does love animals and would<br/>
spend all her time with them if she could, but she is also in school<br/>
and really too busy to do more than have a couple pets of her own to<br/>
care for.  <br/>
<br/>
Neither the article nor video clip state whether the girl is<br/>
homeschooled (or unschooled, for that matter), but it is certainly a<br/>
wonderful example for unschoolers and new parents like myself of <br/>
another real life example of what&#39;s possible for our children.  <br/>
<br/>
This little news story also came at an appropriate time for me as I<br/>
just finished reading &quot;The Unschooling Handbook&quot;.  I admit that by<br/>
midway through the book I was feeling a bit overwhelmed with all that<br/>
I interpreted to be involved in finding unconventional ways to expose<br/>
our children to &quot;school subjects&quot; in the real world.  (I know it&#39;s not<br/>
necessarily helpful to look at the world in terms of subjects, but<br/>
refer to it that way only because that&#39;s how the book is outlined.)  <br/>
<br/>
However, finally the last chapter discussed something that really<br/>
resonated with me.  <br/>
<br/>
To quote from page 215, &quot;That so many children become lost when they<br/>
reach the legal age of majority shouldn&#39;t be surprising.  With all<br/>
their years in school, with classes and assignments scheduled<br/>
throughout for them, when and where do most children get a chance to<br/>
feel useful, to create a meaningful place for themselves?  They&#39;re<br/>
considered too young, too immature, too unreliable, too untrustworthy<br/>
to be allowed to do much of any real value; it&#39;s no wonder so many<br/>
turn to their peers for affirmation and respect.  We &quot;protect&quot; them<br/>
from doing anything much in the way of real, meaningful work, deny<br/>
them the opportunity to find places where they are truly needed, and<br/>
then turn around and blame them for never doing anything worthwhile.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What I took away from this is that locking children up in school for<br/>
12 years inhibits their abilities to find meaningful things for<br/>
themselves and their lives.  Yes, it&#39;s true that a schooled child can<br/>
find meaningful things in their lives, but school interferes by taking<br/>
up too much time and energy.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking the last couple days and trying to put into concise<br/>
words why I want to unschool my child (partly for my own thought<br/>
organization, but also for those inquiring family and friends).  The<br/>
basic theme I came up with was one word - FREEDOM.  Freedom for my<br/>
child to have the time, space, and resources to live and explore life<br/>
in a meaningful way to him.  Freedom for our family to have the time<br/>
and space to be together and share our lives without the dictations<br/>
and restrictions of school.  <br/>
<br/>
So, this video was my dose of the &quot;warm and fuzzies&quot; for the day.  <br/>
