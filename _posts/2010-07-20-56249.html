<div id="ygrps-yiv-1378743500">My 16 month old daughter has playmates that hit and kick  her.  She doesn&#39;t<br/>
seem bothered.  She makes no noise, doesn&#39;t push them away, etc.  I&#39;m<br/>
uncomfortable with her receiving this treatment, but I don&#39;t say or do<br/>
anything because I want my daughter to be free to form her own reaction.<br/>
And, I allow the &quot;hitter&#39;s&quot; mother to handle the situation.<br/>
<br/>
However, I don&#39;t &quot;feel good&quot; about my passivity.  But, I don&#39;t know what<br/>
else to do.<br/>
<br/>
What would you do?<br/>
Thank you for your advice.<br/>

<br/>
If it&#39;s baby-hitting, it&#39;s not hurting her, she&#39;s not falling over,  <br/>
maybe passivity is okay.<br/>
<br/>
But if the hitting is real aggression or danger, think of what you  <br/>
would do if a total stranger came up to her and did that.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I want my daughter to be free to form her own reaction.-=-<br/>
<br/>
This seems on the surface to make sense.  You want her to decide  <br/>
whether she likes opera or sushi on her own.  But while she&#39;s so young  <br/>
and you&#39;re her protector, I don&#39;t think she should be wondering how to  <br/>
react to being kicked or hit (unless she were being trained to accept  <br/>
abusive behavior for marriage in an abusive culture, maybe).<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t kick&quot; or &quot;Don&#39;t hit&quot; seem like good starting moves.  Then if  <br/>
the other mother doesn&#39;t help you with the situation, don&#39;t feel at  <br/>
all bad about a really sharp scary &quot;I said DON&#39;T.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling neither gives anyone special rights, nor does it remove  <br/>
any natural rights from people.  If thinking about unschooling or any  <br/>
special parenting philosophy is keeping you from protecting your  <br/>
child, then that&#39;s too much thinking and too little being in the  <br/>
moment directly.<br/>
