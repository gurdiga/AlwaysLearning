<div id="ygrps-yiv-1408382977">I wanted to say thank you to everyone who had advice<br/>
to offer on my attempts to get published writing a<br/>
children&#39;s book.  I&#39;m giving myself a crash course in<br/>
publishing, doing a self taught workshop to improve my<br/>
craft, talking with several artists, and researching<br/>
the style and genre of books I am interested in.  I&#39;m<br/>
also working on my story.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the help pushing me in the right<br/>
direction.  I knew I could count on everyone here.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1080164447">Do you know about www.nanowrimo.com? November is National Novel Writing<br/>
Month, and you get an instant support group of thousands, all trying to<br/>
complete a 50,000 word novel in a month. Well, 21 days now. Still fun!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1876290970">Good luck with your children&#39;s book.  I&#39;m nearing the halfway point of my<br/>
novel and have been doing the same things as you.  I&#39;m no where near the<br/>
publishing end of things yet, but I hope to get there eventually.<br/>
