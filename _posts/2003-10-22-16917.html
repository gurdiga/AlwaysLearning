<div id="ygrps-yiv-906319627">Deb L. put up a really good response to someone on the HEM-unschooling <br/>
discussion list about whether TV causes violence.  That post is great in its own <br/>
right, but I have a story to tell about it which I&#39;ll put at the end.<br/>
<br/>
Also I put the stories here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/t/violence">http://sandradodd.com/t/violence</a><br/>
but I&#39;m not going to put the personal connection story there, just here for <br/>
you guys.<br/>
<br/>
***The problems may very well go away if TV goes away.  Violence... <br/>
Columbine... where do kids get the idea to kill other kids??  TV.***<br/>
<br/>
Great Britain passed the Juvenile Offences Act of 1847 which said young<br/>
people shouldn&#39;t go to the same prison as adults.  They did it because of<br/>
public concern over the huge numbers of young kids going to jail (not<br/>
just on murder charges) with adult criminals.  Some figures show the<br/>
crime rate in England jumped from 5,000  crimes a year around 1800 to<br/>
20,000 a year sometime in the 1830s.   No one can blame tv for that one. <br/>
<br/>
Fourteen year old Jesse Pomeroy  was arrested in 1874 for the murder of a<br/>
four-year-old.  He was released and immediately killed a ten year old<br/>
girl and then another four year old.  No tv. <br/>
<br/>
In 1924 nineteen year olds Richard Loeb and Nathan Leopold murdered Bobby<br/>
Franks just to see what it was like.   They were from well off families,<br/>
nice neighborhoods.  Never saw tv.<br/>
<br/>
In Bath, Michigan in May, 1927 Andrew Kehoe who was fifty (five?- don&#39;t<br/>
remember) committed the worst case of school violence in American<br/>
history.  First he killed his wife, locked his animals in the barn and<br/>
blew them up,  blew up the school where he was a handyman and blew up his<br/>
truck full of shrapnel.  More explosives were set to go off to kill<br/>
rescue workers but were found by the police.  In all, thirty eight<br/>
children were killed and seven teachers.  Sixty some others were injured.<br/>
  Mr. Kehoe never saw a tv set. <br/>
<br/>
Does TV create violence, really?  Maybe guns create violence.  Knives. <br/>
Baseball bats.  Hammers. Axes, shovels, saws?  Rope?  Dynamite?  Sharp<br/>
sticks, rocks?  Maybe it&#39;s language causes violence because most killers<br/>
spoke.  Maybe it&#39;s books. Clothing? Day time night time wind rain snow<br/>
trees birds frogs. <br/>
<br/>
History is full of killers, some really damn weird ones who never saw TV.<br/>
 The Borgias come to mind easily, and so maybe religion or Pope-ness,<br/>
Pope hood? is the cause of crime.<br/>
 <br/>
For lots of kids, even the bad guys on TV are nicer than the real life<br/>
crazy people they live and go to school with. <br/>
 <br/>

once shot or stabbed or poisoned anyone. Yet. <br/>

Hi Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
Haven&#39;t seen either one for over 10 years. I think of Jessie all the <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry,<br/>
<br/>

Thanks, Joe.<br/>
<br/>
Are you by any chance aware of where Jesse or Kevin are, who both used to <br/>
work at mortuaries?  I&#39;ve been looking for Kevin a little.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
Sandra<br/>
<br/>
===========<br/>
<br/>
The reason I was asking was because Jesse would know where Kevin was.  <br/>
Kevin&#39;s name is Kevin Williams, and I lost contact with him when Holly was a baby.  <br/>
He was a funeral director.   Jesse is female.  I couldn&#39;t remember her last <br/>
name when I wrote to Joe (though he would have because they were sweet at one <br/>
time), so I ddn&#39;t name Kevin&#39;s either, and after Joe&#39;s e-mail came back I <br/>
thought if I could ONLY remember that story, I would remember Jesse&#39;s last name.<br/>
<br/>
Here is &quot;that story,&quot; from Deb&#39;s e-mail:<br/>
&quot;Fourteen year old Jesse Pomeroy  was arrested in 1874 for the murder of a<br/>
four-year-old.  He was released and immediately killed a ten year old<br/>
girl and then another four year old.  No tv. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
My friend Jesse is female.  Her last name is Pomeroy, but &quot;Jesse&quot; is a name <br/>
she adopted as a teen, because she is descended from relatives of that Jesse <br/>
Pomeroy.  Her great grandfather was his parent or sibling (I forget the details).<br/>
<br/>
Jesse and I were in a group of five people who travelled to Pennsylvania <br/>
about 23 years ago in a van that broke down BADLY, repeatedly.  So we spent ten <br/>
days in Maryland with acquaintances while the van was in the shop twice there.  <br/>
Jesse and I went every day by bus and metro to the Smithsonian, and then <br/>
started on the Library of Congress.  <br/>
<br/>
I was looking up wombats, how boy scouts are described by Russians and <br/>
Chinese (para-military political action organization).  Jesse was looking at <br/>
microfilm of 19th century newspaper accounts of the Jesse Pomeroy stuff.  I liked <br/>
looking over her shoulder sometimes, at the side stories and those few ads which <br/>
hadn&#39;t been excised.<br/>
<br/>
Jesse&#39;s mom was mean to her and Jesse ended up being the kid who stayed home, <br/>
so partly out of reactionary spite, Jessy became macabre and dramatic.  She <br/>
drove a hearse.  She was a make-up artist for the dead.  She collected ancient <br/>
Egyptian stuff to decorate their home (against her mom&#39;s will, generally) so <br/>
that it looked like an Egyptian-themed Louisiana whorehouse of the late 19th <br/>
century.<br/>
<br/>
And she did then and still uses &quot;Jesse Pomeroy&quot; as her own name.  She doesn&#39;t <br/>
like kids.  I haven&#39;t seen her since I had any. She would never, ever have <br/>
any.  She doesn&#39;t like much of anyone.  She had a sister who was in the habit of <br/>
finding international travel by being an efficient secretary who put out in <br/>
the extreme, with a perference for exotic locales and elevators.  Jesse herself <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have men touch her (nor women).  Joe flirted and tried, but Jesse <br/>
was impermeable to intimacy.<br/>
<br/>
So yesterday I wondered what her last name was, and today Deb presented me <br/>
with a much-memory-flood-inducing reminder.<br/>
<br/>
I have met SO many weirdly fascinating people in my life, and there are so <br/>
many bizarre stories of people I have interacted with myself that there is no <br/>
soap opera on TV that matches my own real life.  Others have said the same, that <br/>
my life is way beyond what people would believe could have all happened to <br/>
one person.  So when people say TV lies and exaggerates, I think &quot;Well, it lacks <br/>
imagination, very often.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still in contact with two of Joe&#39;s ex girlfriends.  I know all their <br/>
children, current husbands, other exes.... Just the Joe Calkins stories could be <br/>
half a book, and I don&#39;t see him over once every two or three years.<br/>

never run into situations like this.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t you think it says alot about how open we are to others?     I know a<br/>
few people like you,  who have these great stories to tell.  I love it.    I<br/>
know alot more people not like this, though.    I think it has alot to do<br/>
with our desire to know things and discover things.   Also, whether we are<br/>
open to others.   What do you guys think?<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe some of us just attract weirdness?? &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Holy damn cow, that&#39;s weird! <br/>
<br/>
That Jesse Pomeroy story is strange and there&#39;s lots of conflicting <br/>
information on it.  There are lots of stories but the records show he was<br/>
accused of torturing seven kids before he was first rounded up and  held<br/>
for awhile. He had a cleft lip and a white eye and lots of folks thought<br/>
he&#39;d been teased by kids and that&#39;s why he chose kids as victims.   <br/>
<br/>
Some stories say at the time of his arrest there was public outcry about<br/>
dime store novels driving people to violence.  How about that?  They<br/>
weren&#39;t blaming TV they were blaming books.  The story goes he claimed to<br/>
have never read any of them.<br/>
<br/>
We spent much of the day at the hospital with my friend who was having a<br/>
mastectomy.  Last night her doctor came in and Dylan was playing Gameboy<br/>
Advance.  The doctor wanted to play it some and he and Dylan talked<br/>
awhile and he asked Dylan what kinds of things he was interested in.  <br/>
The doc told Dylan he got interested in surgery and decided to become a<br/>
surgeon because he read lots of crime stories and especially liked any<br/>
Jack the Ripper stories he could find.   He said his mom hated him<br/>
reading those books and was just glad he didn&#39;t turn out to be a serial<br/>
killer. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So, my serial killer coincidence wasn&#39;t nearly as interesting as yours,<br/>
but it&#39;s a swirly world nevertheless. <br/>
