<div id="ygrps-yiv-1335771147">I missed who wrote the original here, but I agree about the antagonism <br/>
among unschoolers against Christians.<br/>
<br/>
I love Jesus with all my heart, am trusting in Him alone for my <br/>
salvation, believe that the Bible is God&#39;s Word to us, and <br/>
believe that it is my number one responsibility as a parent <br/>
to show my children how to enter into a relationship with Jesus and <br/>
submit to His will for their lives.   Before making my (prayerful) <br/>
decision to unschool, I joined several unschooling lists and read many <br/>
unschooling message boards.  While I found answers to my questions and <br/>
doubts about unschooling, I was also totally shocked at how <br/>
anti-Christian values they were!  Yet, when I visit Christian <br/>
unschooling sites and read Christian unschooling books, I find myself <br/>
feeling that very few of them are *truly* unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
It would be awesome to find an unschooling board that generally stuck <br/>
to unschooling without talking about how important it is to pass on <br/>
liberal values to our children. <br/>
<br/>
I usually find myself not really *fitting in* on ANY unschooling <br/>
board.  Take the current homosexuality discussion, for example.  <br/>
Someone asked how we would feel if our children were homosexual.  Do I <br/>
answer the question truthfully and spending an untold amount of time <br/>
defending my position, my right to hold that position, and probably <br/>
defending my parenting/unschooling skills in general?  Or do I  just <br/>
keep quiet and not participate in the discussion so as to not make any <br/>
waves (This would mean staying quiet for the majority of the <br/>
discussions that have been on this and other unschooling lists so <br/>
far!)?  Or do I go to a Christian group where I would agree with the <br/>
values but would at best find little common ground when it comes to <br/>
educational philosophy or at worst have to constantly defend my <br/>
unschooling philosophy? <br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s a Christian unschooler to do?  <br/>

<br/>
I do understand where you&#39;re coming from. It&#39;s *wonderful* to find a group<br/>
of people who share a lot of the same values and thoughts. But generally in<br/>
most aspects of our lives we have to cobble together what we need from a lot<br/>
of different folks and groups. Though it&#39;s great if we can find an all<br/>
purpose friend how many people are so lucky? It&#39;s more often that we can<br/>
find someone who shares one of our interests and another friend who shares<br/>
another, people to fill in the gaps so to speak.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling groups never would have come about if the unschoolers hadn&#39;t<br/>
felt that general homeschooling groups didn&#39;t quite fit the needs they had.<br/>
And Christian &quot;unschooling&quot; groups wouldn&#39;t have formed if the unschooling<br/>
groups hadn&#39;t quite fit their needs. Not quite sure how you&#39;d distinguish<br/>
Christian unschooling from Christian real unschooling, but I bet there are<br/>
more out there with the same feelings as you.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Perhaps you could start a list of your own. You could state right up front <br/>
what your goals are for the list. There must be others out there who share <br/>
your same religious convictions and also choose to unschool. Maybe there <br/>
will be more after your list is formed and other Christians get a chance to <br/>
discuss unschooling with you.<br/>
<br/>
I understand where you&#39;re coming from and wish you the best in finding a <br/>
situation that feels right for you.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think part of the challenge to participate in a list is to treat each other <br/>
with respect. More liberal unschoolers can be careful of generalizing when we <br/>
talk about our experiences with particular groups of Christian Homeschoolers. <br/>
Likewise, Christians can recognize that while they believe certain things, <br/>
others don&#39;t, and being told we&#39;re going to hell for our beliefs is not <br/>
constructive.<br/>
<br/>
I understand that you might feel &quot;unpopular&quot; at times on unschooling lists. <br/>
Compared to the world at large, there aren&#39;t THAT many Unschoolers, and most <br/>
of them seem to be pretty liberal.  Being a Christian Unschooler must feel <br/>
lonely at times. (I know being a Lesbian homeschooling family does.)<br/>

like these as LONG as I&#39;m nice and very very clear that my values are MY <br/>
values and that I&#39;m not even remotely interested in forcing other people to <br/>
live by them. The problem is that so many Christian homeschoolers (not all, <br/>
not even most - but enough that most of us have run into them) ARE interested <br/>
in forcing everyone to live according to their values. For example, they want <br/>
laws against abortion and laws not allowing gays into the military. That <br/>
goes, imo, far beyond ones own personal values - that is the desire to force <br/>
other people to live according to ones own religious values, whether they <br/>
share them or not. <br/>
<br/>
I, personally, am not interested in doing that at all. I want to live <br/>
according to my values -- I want that freedom. And I believe very very <br/>
strongly that the only way I&#39;m going to really have that freedom is for <br/>
everybody to have that freedom.<br/>

<br/>
This is a fallacy.<br/>
<br/>
Christians CANNOT recognize that others just believe different things.<br/>
They are commanded by Jesus to teach all nations.  If they don&#39;t try to <br/>
convert us (perhaps by suggesting we&#39;re risking hell, for starters), they are <br/>
not being good Christians, they&#39;re not emulating Christ who spent his life <br/>
preaching.<br/>
<br/>
There are more liberal Chrisitians who don&#39;t have that imperative, but <br/>
evangelican Christians and fundamentalists cannot being to compromise their <br/>
beliefs by any thought that another&#39;s belief system is legitimate.<br/>

The problem is ALSO that so many Christian homeschoolers just walk up to you <br/>
and find out you homeschool and then ASSUME you agree with them on whatever <br/>
values or beliefs they hold. Happened today - and after being socially <br/>
trapped listening to this person rant on and on about her anger that some <br/>
sign in some museum represented a hidden agenda to attack the Christian Faith <br/>
because it said that the arrival of Christianity reduced the power of Viking <br/>
women and how we all needed to really make sure our children realized that <br/>
these attacks on our faith were everywhere and on and on and on..... I had to <br/>
decide whether to escape or argue and whichever I did I knew I was going to <br/>
be stuck with a bad taste in my mouth. (I escaped - coward that I am and <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1875462853">&lt;&lt; the arrival of Christianity reduced the power of Viking <br/>
women &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;m out there in April...<br/>
I will ask her what she knows about Viking women&#39;s rights in their pre-church <br/>
laws.<br/>
<br/>
For one thing, before &quot;the sacrament of marriage,&quot; a marriage could be <br/>
annulled for abuse or homosexuality.  The woman simply put the man&#39;s things <br/>
outside her door, informed her brothers that she had done so, and he was <br/>
outathere.<br/>
<br/>
he introduction of Catholicism (the same Catholicism, or worse than, I&#39;m <br/>
assuming this homeschooler&#39;s Christianity rebelled against not once but most <br/>
likely twice, if she was from one of the very many protestant churches that <br/>
formed out of the Church of England after THEY rejected Catholicism) brought <br/>
legalized abuse and powerlessness to Norse women.  Perhaps Italians and <br/>
Spaniards were just used to it pre-Catholicism, I don&#39;t know.  I know less of <br/>
their earlier legal history.<br/>
<br/>
There were Norse/Icelandic property traditions there too which Catholicism&#39;s <br/>
wills and testaments changed.  The Catholics liked part of a dead man&#39;s stuff <br/>
reverting to the church in exchange for their acknowledgement of his will.  <br/>
Before that women had their dowries (bride price) which was returned on <br/>
divorce, abandonment or death.  The Catholic church in Europe was like the <br/>
new Roman Empire.  &quot;Church Law&quot; tried to supercede local common law, and on <br/>
threat of eternal death often succeeded.<br/>
<br/>
Iceland survived the longest without being overrun by the Catholics, and they <br/>
were overrun with the least impact for a while (maybe forever; I didn&#39;t read <br/>
on through to the present).  There&#39;s a set of post-Catholic Icelandic laws <br/>
I&#39;ve read that have some very strange and particular-to-Iceland laws.  <br/>
<br/>
The kneejerk defense of &quot;Christianity&quot; by a Protestant should always be <br/>
questioned.  Nobody hated the Catholics like the Protestants did.<br/>

There is a lot of talk about unit studies and curriculums.  There are <br/>
essays from people who share an average day in their house and the <br/>

Neither &quot;annulled&quot; nor &quot;divorced&quot; is a Norse word.  I don&#39;t know what their <br/>
