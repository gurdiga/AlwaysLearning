<div id="ygrps-yiv-326029841">Cindy... thanks for the heads up.  I would love to join HSC&#39;s list?  Could<br/>
you send me the e-mail address to sub?<br/>
<br/>
Dawn<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s inclusive but both the Karens who run the organization are Christian.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also radically Libertarian. I did not find it as inclusive as<br/>
<br/>
HSC which is why I am no longer a member! (I am an HSC member.) Dawn,<br/>
<br/>
if you want the reality of CA homeschooling politics, I&#39;d suggest<br/>
<br/>
joining HSC&#39;s list - CHN tends to proclaim &quot;the sky is falling&quot; about<br/>
<br/>
once a year.<br/>
<br/>
Just some dirt on CA homeschooling orgs!! - Cindy<br/>
