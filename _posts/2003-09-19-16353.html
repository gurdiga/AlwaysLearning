<div id="ygrps-yiv-935167275">Okay drawing from my rusty memory... Oldest.. Hero child, Focus of <br/>
all the unfulfilled dreams of the parent.. Middle... THe lost child.. <br/>
really quite invisable.. Fits in but not really noticed.. Baby is the <br/>
family clown..Center of attention.. Provides comedy relief.. <br/>
There are assumptions about people only having 3 children here.. I <br/>
have eight.. Also when a hero child is a disappointmen, the Lost <br/>
child can take the hero&#39;s place.. And there can be a rebel child.. <br/>
WHere all of the families worries and worry energy goes.. Diverting <br/>
the family from dealing with real issues within it. They are very <br/>
interesting theories and in my fam of origin they do not clearly fit..<br/>

<br/>
Even without the traits of birth order though, they&#39;re dealing with a <br/>
different mother, sometimes a different physical or financial situation, sometimes <br/>
the mood has changed in their families in such a way that it has a huge impact.  <br/>
<br/>
People at www.unschooling.com are talking about living through a conversion <br/>
to fundamentalist Christianity as children, replete with bonfires for burning <br/>
all their parents&#39; records and other Satanic influences.  That would make a <br/>
difference, if a child was pre- or post-conversion.<br/>
<br/>
We read lots about families switching from conservative, spanking, structured <br/>
life and school or school-at-home to near-sudden change to unschooling, <br/>
peace, mindfulness.  That would make a difference in the children&#39;s experience with <br/>
their moms.  It wold be like the younger kids had an entirely different life <br/>
and a different set of parents.<br/>
<br/>
My half brother, 19 years younger, DID have a different dad, but same mom.  <br/>
But not the same mom.  When I was little she was young, and home.  When he was <br/>
little, she was in her 40&#39;s, at the bar every day from opening to close (he <br/>
was there too most of the time), etc.<br/>
<br/>
Birth order studies I&#39;ve read rarely address physical changes in the mom and <br/>
family situation.    They seem to be statistical comparisons of traits of <br/>
studies of large groups of people.  As though there were no other factors, what do <br/>
first-borns have in common?  That&#39;s interesting as far as it goes, but within <br/>
any one actual family, I think other factors are greater than just birth <br/>
order.<br/>
<br/>
With only three, we see some definite firstborn stuff with Kirby, some <br/>
unquestionable mid-kid with Marty and Holly KNOWS she inherits the world (if all <br/>
goes well, she&#39;ll be the last remaining child with her pick of the bedrooms, <br/>
probably a decent car to drive, unlike Kirby&#39;s driver&#39;s license experience which <br/>
is he can share my ten year old mini-van, etc.).<br/>
<br/>
Plus you get the gender factors.  A fourth child who&#39;s the same gender as the <br/>
others won&#39;t get the special perks of one who&#39;s the first boy or girl after <br/>
three of the other kind.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-711613908">In Google, just type in Birth Order and a lot of interesting pages <br/>
will come up.  I read about this subject a long time ago and I don&#39;t <br/>
remember a lot of it except that the order that you were born in can <br/>
have an effect on your personality traits.  First borns are usually <br/>
more responsible, last borns are the baby longer--something like <br/>
that.  <br/>
<br/>
This is something I copied off of one of those pages:<br/>

<br/>
This is so true.  I was born when my mother still lived at home.  I think of my aunt and my mother as my sisters and my grandfather as my father.  One day we were discussing my grandfather&#39;s things (he&#39;s gone now) and I told them, &quot;he was my father, too&quot;.  My siblings never had that relationship like I did.  My next two, the ones who are into drugs and alcohol, were born after my mother and I moved out on our own.  They have my father, but my mother didn&#39;t live with him.  She stayed a single mother until my stepfather, who was the father of the youngest two.  So, yes, we all did have a different mother.  I see that with my own kids.  It&#39;s like I had two families, the oldest three, and the youngest two, although the middle one makes her way into either group at will.  My oldest two and youngest two definately had a different mother.<br/>

My eight all saw a different mother.. and father. They were each <br/>
different people looking through their own lenses.. And I started <br/>
parenting at 17.. I am 39 now.. I have gone through just a couple of <br/>
changes in that time... Even the kids who all live here.. See a <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-235162212">my family would confuse any studies.<br/>
oldest is oldest any way it goes as in oldest of the four  however .....<br/>
my only birth child was a only child for me till she was 14  and with her <br/>
father she was  only till she was 10. she remaines my only birth child and <br/>
this for some reason is important to her.<br/>
my 3rd  was, her bio mothers and my husbands youngest and the diffrence <br/>
between her and her bothers was like 7 years.( there is another son in there <br/>
that was hubbys step son)<br/>
our youngest  was the oldest from both her bio&#39;s and they had her till she was <br/>
8 or 9 she is the youngest here except we have my grand child alot and says <br/>
sometimes she feels more like a anoying lil sister than a niece.<br/>
I wonder when they do there studies do they take in account the blended <br/>
familys and so forth.<br/>
I am sure the order has a lot to do with things and  the growth of the parents <br/>
must impact things and like i have read here the fince of the family.<br/>
I personaly wonder if things where better for my  oldest daughter as I was <br/>
young and very very poor and  spent more time being inventive and less time <br/>
making money and buying things. I must confess oldest can rember home made <br/>
bread and so can few of others but barely youngest  says you use to bake all <br/>
the bread in the house and it didnt come from a freezer?<br/>
we have recently sold (sale pending) our home and geting a moblie home and a <br/>
camper to take  the 3 of us(hubby,youngest, and me) on the road some where <br/>
along the path to my own growing I seemed to just mouth what was important to <br/>
me  things like  playing and hiking and just cuddle time. <br/>
Here comes another mommy growth spurt. wonder if I rember how to bake bread?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Right.  I agree.  There are a lot of other factors involved in <br/>
shaping a person&#39;s childhood experience at home than just their <br/>
physical place in the family birth order.  The trouble is, a lot of <br/>
people put a fair amount of store, conscious or otherwise, into <br/>
birth orders, so that there are presumtions and assumptions made <br/>
about a person based on their birth order.  It is particularly <br/>
annoying to those of us for whom those presumptions are decidedly <br/>
off base due to the circumstances of our childhoods.  <br/>
<br/>
What it means is that, barring being dishonest, I am reticent about <br/>
telling people my birth order until they know me some and can take <br/>
it in stride.  For a lot of folks, that is the first thing that they <br/>
ask: &quot;How many kids in your family?&quot; or &quot;How many brothers and <br/>
sisters did you have?&quot; followed closely by &quot;Where were you in that?&quot; <br/>
or some variation of that question.  Of course they ask because they <br/>
are forming some general ideas about who you are, or what kind of <br/>
person you are, or what to expect from you.  Why do people put so <br/>
much weight behind the flawed and incomplete notions in the birth <br/>
order theory?  Is it popular culture,  like a Brady Bunch thing, or <br/>
what?<br/>
