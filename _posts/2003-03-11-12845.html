Well it&#39;s certainly true of Sierra. The boys could care less about doing that <br/>
kind of stuff..but she is always trying to fix someones hair.<br/>
Jalen (two y.o. brother) just came out with two hair clips on, a pink tutu <br/>
and a black velvet girls shirt.<br/>
He followed her around and danced with her until that got old, then he <br/>
stripped to his diaper and put puddle boots on!  Funny guy. He gets groomed <br/>
frequently by his sister.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
