<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I am ready :-) <br/>
<br/>
The Unschooling Toolbox is a set of 48 business-sized cards, each with an unschooling idea on front *and* back (so 96 thoughts total), plus a magnet.<br/>
<br/>
Each day pull out a new card and attach it with the magnet somewhere you&#39;ll run across it several times a day (like your refrigerator). <br/>
<br/>
The (unintentionally) deluxe version has a memory stone to carry in your pocket. So if there&#39;s an idea you&#39;re having trouble remembering to do in the moment, you put the memory stone in your pocket to remind you. They&#39;re just regular stones so you can use your own. :-) (The (unintentionally) deluxe version also comes with a tea tin to hold the cards and stone. The magnet ca attach to the tin which is a little more portable than your refrigerator ;-))<br/>
<br/>
Some sample Unschooling Toolbox ideas. (91 more :-))<br/>
<br/>
* The right answer isn’t as important as trying things out to discover what is right for them.<br/>
* If they can’t say no, then you aren’t really asking.<br/>
* Build meeting your own needs into your day. You have that power!<br/>
* Unschooling is about creating an environment in which natural learning can flourish. — Sandra Dodd<br/>
* Why not?<br/>
<br/>
Two options:<br/>
<br/>
$7 these are buff/oak tag/manila folder color card stock. I only have 11 sets of these. To make up for the less than unexciting color, these are world travelers :-) They&#39;ve been to Portugal, The Netherlands and England. And I can send them out right away.<br/>
<br/>
(I also have 1 set left that&#39;s bilingual: Portuguese and English. Marta Pires and Alex Polikowsky did the translating.)<br/>
<br/>
$10 these are pretty brightly hued card stock. It will take me a couple of days to cut these. (I can also print them in English/Portuguese.)<br/>
<br/>
I do NOT have any tea tins left. But more will be coming slowly as I drink the tea that&#39;s in them. If you&#39;re interested in eventually having a tea tin and memory stone, just let me know and I&#39;ll make a list.<br/>
<br/>
$4 extra (for postage) for tea tin and stone. **WHEN** I get some more tea tins.<br/>
<br/>
Contact me off list:<br/>

<br/>
A few weeks ago, I was wondering if there should be an app that was somewhat similar to your toolbox cards (although today is, I think, the first time I&#39;ve heard of them). My idea was about virtual cards someone could flip through in a spare moment or when they need a little inspiration.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve thought of it.  I&#39;d like for the links to be clickable and have been too busy to look into how to do that, in an eBook.  If the file for the eBook had color photos and clickable links, having a B&W version for paper-print would be simple.<br/>
<br/>
Some of those photos would be fine in black and white.  Some wouldn&#39;t, so that would be a complicating factor.  <br/>
<br/>
And there are enough for three books there already.  Another complication. :-)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a definite maybe.<br/>
