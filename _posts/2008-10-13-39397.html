<div id="ygrps-yiv-687044921">This isn&#39;t written by me, nor by the same anonymous as the other day.  <br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m very interested in this, though, so let rip, please.<br/>
<br/>
------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br/>
---------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; -=-In unschooling radically, the goal is peaceful interactions. To<br/>
&gt; have that, it&#39;s imperative to leave behind our expectations about how<br/>
&gt; people will act and react.-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would agree that I have a personal goal of more peaceful  <br/>
interactions with my kids--but<br/>
it&#39;s not &quot;THE&quot; goal for our family.  There seems to be a pretty  <br/>
strong judgement inherent in<br/>
that statement that non-peaceful interactions are bad, but I&#39;ve found  <br/>
that they have their<br/>
place in our lives as well.<br/>
<br/>
Just recently, my daughter, uncharacteristically, yelled at an adult  <br/>
in our group.  I instantly<br/>
rushed over to &quot;restore the peace.&quot;  As I was talking with her about  <br/>
what had happened, I<br/>
realized that she was right on the money--this person wasn&#39;t  <br/>
respecting her rights as a<br/>
person, was being very condescending and had also been drinking.    <br/>
The only way for my<br/>
daughter to be heard was to raise the energetic volume of the  <br/>
situation (and her voice).  It<br/>
made this lady back off.  I was going to suggest that next time she  <br/>
come to me, but then I<br/>
had to have an honest moment with myself and realized that i would  <br/>
have probably acted<br/>
in ways to &quot;keep the peace,&quot; not necessarily help my daughter.  This  <br/>
woman&#39;s drinking had<br/>
all of us a little thrown.  She handled the situation in the only way  <br/>
open to her in that<br/>
moment, and she got the job done.<br/>
<br/>
I have occasional disagreements with my kids, but there is no  <br/>
expectation on my part that<br/>
if I happen to be the one to raise my voice that they need to either  <br/>
1.  be afraid of me, or<br/>
2. acquiesce because of it.  And they do neither, because they have  <br/>
the trust now that I&#39;m<br/>
not &quot;pulling rank&quot; if I get frustrated and raise my voice.  It might  <br/>
not look peaceful in the<br/>
moment, but we usually end up with a new level of understanding, or  <br/>
agree to disagree.<br/>
<br/>
When we were at a Waldorf school many years ago, people there put on  <br/>
a false persona of<br/>
&quot;peace.&quot;  There was a very strong judgment about behaving peacefully  <br/>
and if you did, that<br/>
meant that you were an enlightened person/parent.  Those parents can  <br/>
be just as<br/>
disconnected from their kids as the ones that yell a lot.  And there  <br/>
can be peaceful, quiet<br/>
parents that are connected with their kids, just as there can also be  <br/>
loud, raucous families<br/>
that are explosive and passionate and loving.</div>

<br/>
Some people do like really soft voices and gentle touch and whispered  <br/>
advice and that...  at least when they have company.<br/>
<br/>
I like to get excited about things in enthusiastic ways.  I like  <br/>
humor.  I like surprises.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, maybe it&#39;s revealing the parts of me I need to work on, or maybe<br/>
not, but I totally agree!  :)<br/>
<br/>
My mom often yelled at my sister and I growing up, and it was<br/>
definitely not in a respectful manner. But there are times now when<br/>
she can say things in a very peaceful facade but have a negative<br/>
implication behind the statement or question.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, my husband and I, and thus our kids, tend to be<br/>
very open and sometimes sarcastic, and occasionally loud. Sarcasm is<br/>
something I always fear people will take the wrong way, as in they<br/>
might think we actually MEAN what we say, when in reality we both like<br/>
exaggerating and batting back and forth with our words. <br/>
<br/>
We know other couples who think it&#39;s awful that we &quot;fight&quot; so much,<br/>
but these are the same couples who talk down about their spouses<br/>
behind their backs, because they don&#39;t feel free to share what they<br/>
think when their spouse is present. What looks like arguing to some is<br/>
our way of getting out thoughts out and figuring out what we want and<br/>
working together. Sure, there have been times when we&#39;ve had to work<br/>
on our understanding of what the other person has actually said (the<br/>
classic &quot;he says/she hears&quot; thing), but overall our marriage is<br/>
stronger and more open and giving than if we always talked with the<br/>
intent of not getting loud or &quot;angry.&quot; The times I hold my tongue,<br/>
sometimes, are the times I let my anger build and &quot;self-talk&quot; the<br/>
angry things I want to say but didn&#39;t, letting it escalate into a<br/>
whole other issue when I could&#39;ve stopped it at the get-go by just<br/>
voicing my thoughts the first time.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not to say that you shouldn&#39;t think before you speak, though!<br/>
Reckless words spewed forth in quick anger is something we both try to<br/>
avoid.<br/>
<br/>
Our oldest daughter, 6 (almost), has picked up the sarcasm quite well,<br/>
and will call me out on many occasions. I love it! It shows she&#39;s not<br/>
afraid to challenge me, and it shows she&#39;s learning the skills to<br/>
banter verbally and not just mimic back things she&#39;s heard me say.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1640062440">Peacefulness is a overall vibe, and not always about loudness or quietness.<br/>
I do think loudness (that isn&#39;t contentious) encourages freer discourse.<br/>
And in my experience, suppressed negativity may seem better at the outset<br/>
yet often discourages constructive discourse and action.  All that plays a<br/>
big role.  If a person gravitates toward quiet and avoids noise, there is<br/>
some truth to the thought that they may avoid a lot of hassle and lead a<br/>
more peaceful existence.  There&#39;s also some truth to the idea that they may<br/>
not learn very much about themselves or others that way.  Or maybe they<br/>
could if they&#39;re good at observing.  If a person likes noise for the sake of<br/>
pure noise and gravitates indiscriminately toward any noise, they may run<br/>
into more than the usual share of trouble.  If they&#39;re open to learning from<br/>
their experience, they could do so.  Or maybe not, if for some reason<br/>
they&#39;re unable to observe.<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately at least some of what I want to end up with is peace, even if<br/>
some wrangling or discord intervenes somewhere in the middle.  It may not be<br/>
the only goal and certainly isn&#39;t the most important one but peace is a<br/>
pretty big deal for me.<br/>

<br/>
Hmmm... what about &quot;peaceful noise&quot;? :: grin :: I would  consider myself a <br/>
person who tends to gravitate toward any noise-at one point,  jangly, <br/>
metal-clanging type noises were huge in my life (numerous, huge, metal  earrings to <br/>
jangle right by my ears still get found in stored boxes  now and again). I do <br/>
notice that some people are discomfited by my kids&#39; noise,  but to me it is more <br/>
like the radio going in the background: sometimes I  can tune it out when I <br/>
need to and sometimes I tune into it when I need it,  too.<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe it is another one of those things like introverts and  extroverts, in <br/>
that one really can&#39;t know where the other is coming from. I  guess I&#39;d equate <br/>
it to bright, loud colors-which I&#39;m also drawn to. I  don&#39;t find that I have <br/>
more trouble than other folks... in fact, I&#39;d probably  say less. I have less <br/>
stress than other folks I know, and overall I&#39;m a  pretty laid back, easy-going <br/>
kind of person. Seeing it all out in black and  white, it almost seems like <br/>
an oxymoron, but there you have it.  :~D On the surface, someone who has <br/>
melodious quiet or  lots of silence, pastels, routine, etc. seems extremely dull to <br/>
me.  Uninteresting. Almost a &quot;waiting to live&quot; kind of thing. I *do* know that <br/>
other  people process things differently, so I know that isn&#39;t their <br/>
perception of it.  I guess it all really boils down to being happy with who we are.  <br/>
:~)<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>

Generally my words are intentional, but I&#39;ve been known to say things<br/>
that can be turned around in a way that I never considered.  Mostly<br/>
though, these things get turned into humorous jabs at me and that&#39;s ok<br/>
because I can laugh at myself.</div>
