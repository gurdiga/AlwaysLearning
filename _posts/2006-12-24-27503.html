<div id="ygrps-yiv-1711599906">I was working on this page<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/art/titles/hollytitle">http://sandradodd.com/art/titles/hollytitle</a><br/>
which has an unwieldy URL, but it makes sense for it to be where it is.<br/>
<br/>
But in checking links from there (that is, in poking around from  <br/>
there), I came to my friend Steve Muhlberger&#39;s blog.  He&#39;s a history  <br/>
professor in Ontario.  As part of discussing a new U.S. Congressman  <br/>
who&#39;s Moslem, he tells the following story, which would probably be a  <br/>
big surprise to those (very) many conservative Christian  <br/>
homeschooling parents (and curriculum writers) who assure their  <br/>
children regularly that the U.S. is and always was &quot;a Christian nation.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a long debate on this question of whether the USA is a  <br/>
Christian nation. No one doubts that the vast majority of white  <br/>
settlers in the 13 colonies were at least formally Christian, or that  <br/>
the Angl0-Americans were formally Christian at the time of the  <br/>
Revolution. But there was little invoking of a specifically Christian  <br/>
God or of Jesus Christ in revolutionary rhetoric. Indeed in the  <br/>
backwash of the Revolution state-supported Christian churches were  <br/>
disestablished, and the First Amendment forbade the federal  <br/>
government from favoring any specific religion.<br/>
<br/>
One interesting document relevant to this debate is the US-Libya  <br/>
treaty of 1797. The context as I understand it is this. There were  <br/>
still &quot;Barbary Pirates&quot; in the Mediterranean, Muslims raiding  <br/>
Christian shipping and occasionally Christian settlements (even in  <br/>
Iceland!) and enslaving sailors and others. Christian countries paid  <br/>
tribute to avoid such problems. But the new USA was not covered by  <br/>
those treaties and was vulnerable to piratic action. Establishing  <br/>
that the US would neither pay tribute nor allow its shipping to be  <br/>
preyed upon on the excuse of religious warfare was an early priority  <br/>
of the US government (see what you can find under &quot;War with the  <br/>
Barbary Pirates&quot;) . Both military and diplomatic action was taken. On  <br/>
the diplomatic side we see the treaty with Libya which stated  <br/>
(quoting from Juan Cole):<br/>
<br/>
                  ...the Government of the United States is in no  <br/>
sense founded on the Christian religion.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, holy war was no excuse for piracy against the United  <br/>
States.<br/>
