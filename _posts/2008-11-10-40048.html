<br/>
Oooh.  Loaded question and political buzz-phrase!<br/>
<br/>
Let me rephrase it in a less prickly way.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How does attending to each family member&#39;s needs help them learn to  <br/>
live together as a group?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just like that.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yesterday, my daughter who will be 3 next month was watching tv with my <br/>
husband.  All of a sudden, she said &quot;I&#39;m cleaning up!&quot; and started <br/>
picking up things in the living room.  By the time she was done, the <br/>
living room floor was cleared.  She was quite proud of herself &quot;Look, I <br/>
cleaned up!&quot; and I thanked her.  <br/>
<br/>
She put all her toys and clothes in her room.  And she got a few of my <br/>
husband socks and some mail in her room too.  But so what?  She&#39;s not <br/>
even 3, but she saw something that needed to be done and did it!  And <br/>
people say, well of couse, little ones are always helpful.  Yes, they <br/>
are.  Until it gets squashed out of them.  I see no reason why she <br/>
won&#39;t just as helpful at 13 as she is now.</div>

 </span></blockquote>There seems to be a built-in compulsion for children to want to grow  <br/>
up and become useful valuable integral members of their &quot;tribe,&quot; and  <br/>
during the teen years that natural urge is very often confounded and  <br/>
distorted into a feeling of desperation to belong to a group. We see  <br/>
it in the extreme form in gangs. We see it in the cliques that form  <br/>
and are so all-important to middle and high school kids.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t seen that in my own kids - they have no desperation for some  <br/>
sort of peer group-identity. Once in a while I&#39;ve even had kind of a  <br/>
strange passing thought that maybe there was something wrong with them  <br/>
that their &quot;group&quot; identity seems to be so about their own family.  <br/>
Then I came to my senses and realized that this was the natural way  <br/>
things should be - that it is the other more common focus on peer  <br/>
groups that is unnatural. My kids are sociable and have lots of  <br/>
friends, but their &quot;identity&quot; seems very organic to me as opposed to  <br/>
the school-kids whose identity seems artificial, desperate, and  <br/>
cobbled together and dependent on what social group they happen to be  <br/>
&quot;in&quot; with.<br/>
<br/>
All that to say that unschooled children and teens engaging in simple  <br/>
and unexpected-in-this-society acts, like voluntarily and happily  <br/>
being helpful around the house, are the result of nurturing that  <br/>
organic identity - respecting and supporting all those urges and not  <br/>
squashing or undermining them by imposing external rules and  <br/>
&quot;consequences&quot; or bribes or punishments to try to manipulate their  <br/>
behavior. Instead of manipulation, older members of the family can  <br/>
show that they themselves are glad to be contributing to the family  <br/>
life and that they receive great satisfaction and joy from it, and  <br/>
they can openly and encouragingly welcome the increasing contributions  <br/>
of the younger ones.<br/>
