took him home.  I got a flat tire and ended up eating dinner with his<br/>
folks.  He was going to school at Pacific U,  and he actually ended up<br/>
dating my friend Judy for a few weeks.  He tipped over their canoe at<br/>
Haag lake and she ended the whole affair. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
I cannot remember his name but what a smile!  Brian, maybe?  Now I&#39;ll be<br/>
reminiscing all night!<br/>
