&gt; Book Description<br/>
&gt; More than five million children are currently taking<br/>
&gt; Ritalin as a result of<br/>
&gt; being diagnosed with attention deficit disorder<br/>
&gt; (ADD). In some school<br/>
&gt; districts, 20 percent of the students are medicated,<br/>
&gt; lining up each day at the<br/>
&gt; nurse&#39;s office to receive their midday dose. With<br/>
&gt; such staggering numbers, one<br/>
&gt; would think there is indisputable evidence that ADD<br/>
&gt; exists and that Ritalin is<br/>
&gt; the ideal way to treat it. But the exact opposite is<br/>
&gt; true. The ADD Hoax is an<br/>
&gt; in-depth look at the crime being committed against<br/>
&gt; our children--children who<br/>
&gt; are &quot;diagnosed&quot; with ADD and then exposed to the<br/>
&gt; effects of Ritalin, a drug<br/>
&gt; with massive distribution that is matched in volume<br/>
&gt; only by the number of<br/>
&gt; uncertainties surrounding it. This up-to-date book<br/>
&gt; chronicles the ADD hoax and<br/>
&gt; gives parents and other concerned people the<br/>
&gt; necessary ammunition to fight this<br/>
&gt; epidemic of mistreatment.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When I was a special education teacher, I taught a ten year old boy who<br/>
had been in special day classes and unmedicated for at least three years.<br/>
When we finally got his mom and grandma to agree to a trial of medication<br/>
(ritalin), the change was night and day. He went from crawling on the<br/>
floor and hooting, lunging at kids in the lunch line because they gave<br/>
him &quot;funny looks&quot;, threatening to jump out windows, and just being<br/>
generally miserable... to being able to sit and talk, have real<br/>
conversations, focus. It wasn&#39;t perfect, there was this... somber-ness, I<br/>
guess, that came over him, he went from off the wall to serious and<br/>
solemn, but it was better. He was living with a very ill grandma and a<br/>
mom who was addicted to crack, and there was talk about him going into<br/>
foster care or being institutionalized because grandma just couldn&#39;t do<br/>
it any more... but on ritalin, they could manage.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, before he went on ritalin he always wanted coffee, which<br/>
can have the same paradoxical calming effect on people with ADHD (people<br/>
with just ADD have difficulty with focus but aren&#39;t hyperactive). Since<br/>
at least the seventies, caffiene has been used as sort of an<br/>
non-prescription ritalin...<br/>
<br/>
I do think ADD and ADHD are overdiagnosed, but I also think that there is<br/>
a real illness there. I think it&#39;s a continuum, like most things. I know<br/>
people who all into a mild depression, or show some of the symptoms of<br/>
depression  - actually, I think everyone does sometimes - but they don&#39;t<br/>
need medication. OTOH, I wouldn&#39;t claim that depression is a false<br/>
diagnosis. <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;d question that conclusion. Your doctor is suggesting that <br/>
someone with a short attention span who is not ADD wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
helped by Ritalin. If that were the case, then only 5% of the <br/>
population that is estimated to truly have this problem would be <br/>
helped by taking the drug, and the other 15% would not. While I <br/>
can see that teachers may put pressure on parents to put their <br/>
kids on Ritalin in the hopes that it will drug the kids into more <br/>
acceptable behavior, if the Ritalin were not making the situation <br/>
better for the teachers, or if it were exacerbating the situation, I&#39;d <br/>
think the teachers would mention this to the parents, and the <br/>
drug would be stopped. It&#39;s difficult for me to believe that 20% of <br/>
the kids in this country have ADD while in other countries the <br/>
incidence is a fraction of that.<br/>
<br/>
Admittedly, I don&#39;t know much about ADD, but I recall reading <br/>
recently that some neurologists found a way to positively identify <br/>
individuals with ADD using a brain scan of some sort. Prior to <br/>
this, kids were (and still are) given the diagnosis based on the <br/>
results of the Connor&#39;s Scale, which rates the anectodal <br/>
evidence from parents and teachers.<br/>
<br/>
DH and I were once discussing the ADD phenomenon. I <br/>
commented that I didn&#39;t understand how an amphetamine would <br/>
help someone who was having problems sitting still. It seemed <br/>
that a sedative would be better for helping someone calm down. <br/>
He then asked me, in an incredulous voice, if I&#39;d never heard of <br/>
people taking speed  during finals in college to help them focus. <br/>
DUH!<br/>
<br/>
My understanding is that Ritalin was not formulated to help with <br/>
ADD specifically, and has been a pharmaceutical since long <br/>
before ADD became a household term.<br/>

And &quot;different abled&quot; is closer but still irritating teacher-talk.<br/>

If we backed away from all that stuff and talked about the range of normal <br/>

<br/>
No.  She says that when they identify a kid and put him on that drug, if the <br/>
drug doesn&#39;t help. they change their diagnosis.<br/>
<br/>
So instead of having any stats on who Ritalin doesn&#39;t help, they say Ritalin <br/>
ALWAYS helps ADD, and if it didn&#39;t help, you obviously didn&#39;t have ADD.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of drugging kids so school can work its same dull boring way, why not <br/>
admit that LOTS of kids can&#39;t learn that way, and stop trying?<br/>
<br/>
First we have school as a given.  As an element people aren&#39;t questioning.  <br/>
As though it were always there and we have NO alternative but to breathe air <br/>
and go to school.<br/>
<br/>
And if SCHOOL is more solid than an individual human is, then yes, a lot of <br/>
humans are problematical to keeping school happy and peaceful.  So they will <br/>
be labelled and drugged.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That scenario is wrong.<br/>
<br/>
IF lots of people have short attention spans and like to move, then they need <br/>
to be given the room and time and freedom to do that.  We can do that with <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
So we remove the cage and the animal &quot;fits&quot; and functions, while the cage <br/>
itself was the problem.<br/>
<br/>
Drugging the animal to make the cage seem bigger is cage worship.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think I agree to a point... but then how do you differentiate between<br/>
the range of normal and a problem? Depression is the example I use<br/>
because I&#39;ve lived it - I needed to have a line between bummed-out,<br/>
talk-to-a-friend blues and can&#39;t-stop-crying, wish-I-was-dead depression.<br/>
I don&#39;t think that&#39;s within the range of normal, and when I&#39;m asking<br/>
myself why I can&#39;t just get it together like everyone else, it helps to<br/>
have a label. I suppose I could say that my serotonin reuptake is lower<br/>
than most people (I think that&#39;s what it is) but to me it&#39;s 6 of one, a<br/>
half dozen of the other...<br/>
<br/>
I worked with people in the mental health field who told me that Elvis<br/>
was a close relative and his army was coming on Monady to vanquish the<br/>
unholy. I had a boss once with bipolar disorder who told me my assignment<br/>
for the day was to make sure she didn&#39;t ge too close to the new temp,<br/>
because she wanted to jump his nones and didn&#39;t think she could control<br/>
herself.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, my brother was in special ed classes throughout most of his school<br/>
life because he had &quot;minimal brain dysfunction&quot; (later the terminology<br/>
changed, now it&#39;s a learning disability) and I think that was pointless<br/>
and stupid and hurt him. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe the difference is labeling a condition, and not a person.<br/>

That&#39;s  not being bi-polar, that&#39;s just being tacky!   &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Bi-polar&quot; is a state of some people&#39;s being.  For them it&#39;s normal.  The <br/>
need tools and maybe drugs for coping, they don&#39;t need to be labelled insane.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Maybe the difference is labeling a condition, and not a person.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s not much difference if you&#39;re the person with the labelled condition, <br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
About &quot;clinical depression,&quot; I&#39;ve been there too.  It&#39;s the lowest range of <br/>
my personal normal ranges.  It&#39;s dangerous,  but I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s <br/>
&quot;abnormal&quot; for me.<br/>
<br/>
Some say however happy you are when you&#39;re at your most elated happiest is <br/>
the same distance from your baseline as you will be when you are at your <br/>
lowest.<br/>
<br/>
Some people are very near baseline all the time.  Never too exciteable, never <br/>
very sad.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It feels really different to me.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve spent a lot of years in the mental health system, I guess from age 6<br/>
to now, although 15 to about 22 were the years I spent almost constantly<br/>
institutionalized. During those seven years I felt defined by being<br/>
&quot;mentally ill&quot;, like that was the whole of my existence, and I felt<br/>
pretty helpless to change any of it. On the other side, it felt like<br/>
whatever I did didn&#39;t matter, since I was mentally ill. <br/>
<br/>
Things started to change when I found the mental health consumer<br/>
movement, and started hanging out with those folks. I went to a<br/>
conference at UC Berkeley and met peope like Howie the Harp and found<br/>
some sense of power.  Now I think I consider my episodic depression and<br/>
dissociative symptoms as not &quot;normal&quot;, but just as part of me, like my<br/>
asthma and my myopia. I&#39;d be happy to have all of them fixed, but since<br/>
that doesn&#39;t seem to be possible now I go ahead and treat the symptoms so<br/>
that I can function better. I also tell people I&#39;m close to that I have<br/>
these issues, Rain knows what to do if I have an asthma attack and can&#39;t<br/>
talk, my two best friends came up this fall and gently reminded my that<br/>
&#39;twas the season that my seasonal depression usually hit...<br/>
<br/>
And now I can pretty much pass &lt;g&gt;, although the first few years I spent<br/>
out of institutios I felt like there was a huge scarlet C for crazy on my<br/>
forehead. I&#39;m thinking that most of the folks on this list who know me in<br/>
&quot;real life&quot; didn&#39;t know all that....<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess I&#39;m not bothered about not being normal. It&#39;s okay with me. When<br/>
I was younger it was a bigger deal, but now it&#39;s okay. <br/>
<br/>
Rain and both fight over our &quot;Why Be Normal?&quot; coffee mug, and she<br/>
instantly glommed on lines from the Fantasticks about &quot;Please, God, don&#39;t<br/>
let me be *normal*&quot;. Somehow normal has a different connotation for us...<br/>
maybe what you define as normal is what I&#39;d call being okay.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the same distance from your baseline as you will be when you are at <br/>
&gt; your  lowest.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Some people are very near baseline all the time.  Never too <br/>
&gt; exciteable, never very sad.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that&#39;s probably true - although I think people have widely<br/>
