<div id="ygrps-yiv-2006093753">I thought of the ones on here who have asked about things for children that have a passion for all things war / battle and wanted to share something our son Zachariah found.  <br/>
<br/>
Zac discovered a new Manga series called &quot;Hetalia  Axis Powers&quot;   We found it at Barnes and Nobel but I just looked and Amazon has it too.  In fact volume 2 just came out on Dec 28 so we are ordering it.  It is rated older teen age 16+<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing from reading it that it is rated older due to the ability to &quot;get&quot; some of what they are bantering back and forth about. Not sure otherwise as I didn&#39;t see any &quot;adult&quot; stuff!<br/>
<br/>
They use anthropomorphism - giving human characteristics to the countries.  I really enjoyed reading the short personality synopsis they had for each country.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He said it is also in Anime form but that he had trouble viewing it on-line due to the web site constantly asking him if he was 18.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
from the back cover - or front as you would have it - being as it is a Manga book:   ;)<br/>
<br/>
Great Empires, A Fight to the Finish ... and Pasta?<br/>
<br/>
Get ready to brush up on world history with these handsome and hysterical personifications of the Axis Powers as they meet, become friends and form one of the most powerful alliances the world has ever seen!  It all begins when tough soldier Germany stumbles upon Italy, who despite being the descendant of the greatest empire in history, is found hiding in a tomato box.  In another twist of fate around a rather lovely kotatsu, Japan hops on board and the Axis Powers are forged.  What trials and tribulations will this mighty trio face?<br/>
