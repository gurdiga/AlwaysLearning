<div id="ygrps-yiv-551855669">Does anyone have any suggestions for games that allow you to make movies? My kids are 8. We saw The Movies software, but after reading several reviews, I am not sure this would be a good one to get. All of the reviews said it was complicated to figure out and that the tutorial stinks. Sam wants something that he can create movies by choosing characters, themes, etc. <br/>

Thanks!<br/>
