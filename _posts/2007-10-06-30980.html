<div id="ygrps-yiv-80338309">Hi,My son turned 6yo. yesterday. So, i guess we are officially<br/>
unschoolers now. I wonder if i should do anything different? Sometimes<br/>
i want to say to him: You can learn anything you want but i want you<br/>
too want to learn something each day. Boy, that sounds dumb when i<br/>
write it down. I know he&#39;s learning all the time. I think what i&#39;m<br/>
expecting is for him to come up to me and say mom, today i want to<br/>
learn to read or i want to learn about bugs and stuff like that. He<br/>
doesn&#39;t really ask alot of questions. I asked him if there was<br/>
something he wanted to learn more about and he said no. I told him<br/>
that i am here and i will help him find what he needs to know and i<br/>
will always help him. I asked him if there&#39;s anything he wants to<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Learn something new for yourself.  Take him to the library, because you <br/>
need to get some books for yourself.  Take him along to a needlework <br/>
store, or an art supply store, or a museum or zoo because you want to <br/>
see something there.  If he wants to check out books, or buy some yarn, <br/>
or get some clay or paints, cool, but you don&#39;t have to make the trip <br/>
about what he wants to learn; go because *you* want to (but don&#39;t take <br/>
too long in the needlework store &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
  And most of all --<br/>
<br/>
Take both of you to a bookstore that carries Frank Smith&#39;s &quot;The Book of <br/>
Learning and Forgetting,&quot; buy a copy for yourself, and a book of your <br/>
son&#39;s choosing, and read together.  Before you do anything like worry <br/>
or push or fret, read that book.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>you could try noticing one thing that he learned each day- just keep a <br/>
log of the things you see him doing- not just schooly things by life <br/>
things he learns- <br/>
<br/>
my daughter is 4 and she was looking at a magazine that has swords in <br/>
it- she was looking at them and then said to me- I am thinking about <br/>
how they are made- I said ok- she then came over and said swords are <br/>
made with fire and water- and that is all she knew- now this is a <br/>
magaizne not a educational book so I have no idea where the knowledge <br/>
came from that you use fire and water to make swords- I said I think <br/>
you are right---<br/>
<br/>
that was her learning or at least thinking about where something comes <br/>
from</div>

 </span></blockquote>EEEEERRRRRRRRRKKKKK (that was the sound of screeching breaks). As you noted,<br/>
this is NOT the voice of unschooling. This is a recording from your past<br/>
that needs to be erased. Completely. And maybe burned. Sacrificially.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I think what i&#39;m<br/>
&gt;&gt;expecting is for him to come up to me and say mom, today i want to<br/>
&gt;&gt;learn to read or i want to learn about bugs and stuff like that.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It rarely happened like that for my kids. It would be more like one of them<br/>
intently looking at a bug and then making some kind of sound and I would<br/>
look too and then we would both be looking intently at the bug and then one<br/>
of us would mention something interesting we&#39;re seeing and then we would<br/>
talk about that, or look something up.<br/>
<br/>
Or it would be making cookies and measuring ingredients and seeing that the<br/>
teaspoon also said &quot;5 ml&quot; and what either of those things meant, and how to<br/>
know the difference between the different sized spoons.<br/>
<br/>
The examples could go on and on. Rarely did I formally ask the question,<br/>
&quot;What do you want to learn?&quot; It was usually pretty evident, and when it<br/>
wasn&#39;t, or when things were lulling, I would be on the lookout for novel<br/>
experiences or books or events, etc. Or sometimes we just hung around. LOTS<br/>
of things came from that.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;He<br/>
&gt;&gt;doesn&#39;t really ask alot of questions.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, he&#39;s probably just living. In natural living, most people don&#39;t ask lots<br/>
of questions. If we find something that we are really interested in,<br/>
questions often arise. It is a natural process. I bet your son is observing<br/>
a whole lot, and I bet if you share information with him that you think is<br/>
interesting, he&#39;ll be interested in it too on some level. And observe him.<br/>
See what catches his interest. Provide stuff around that. He may not ask you<br/>
questions, but that really isn&#39;t relevant to his learning.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I asked him if there was<br/>
&gt;&gt;something he wanted to learn more about and he said no.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t ask this question anymore, unless you feel like he does want to<br/>
learn something but isn&#39;t asking it on his own for some reason. Your asking<br/>
it is eventually going to make him think that he should be thinking of<br/>
something to ask and that just sets up an unnatural, stressful situation.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What does he like to do?  That&#39;s where you should start.  I have one <br/>
daughter who didn&#39;t/doesn&#39;t ask a lot of questions, wasn&#39;t/isn&#39;t <br/>
really obvious in her learning patterns.  She quietly intakes <br/>
everything around her though, absorbs the world in her own way, <br/>
remembers EVERYTHING, and notices everything around her.  I think <br/>
that is largely because she isn&#39;t asking and talking all the time.<br/>
<br/>
I have another daughter who asks and talks all the time, is really <br/>
obvious in her learning patterns, and says what she knows and sees.  <br/>
Both of them are learning all the time without me directing them.  <br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m ignoring them either.  I play with them and <br/>
talk to them and watch movies with them and go to parks and stores <br/>
and drives in the car.  We DO things together.  <br/>
<br/>
Just because a kid is suddenly &quot;school&quot; age, doesn&#39;t mean your life <br/>
should change dramatically.  Just continue doing stuff together that <br/>
you guys like to do.  From that you will find his passions and see <br/>
the learning happening.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-924595927">You might want to think about what you think learning looks like. It <br/>
sounds like you are expecting him to decide that learning is a <br/>
formalized experience where he actively chooses to do something with <br/>
the end goal of having obtained knowledge from that experience. It <br/>
only looks like that when you are in a formalized learning arena. <br/>
Wild and free learning does not always garner a skill or a finite <br/>
body of knowledge at the end of the day. It is like gathering pieces <br/>
to a bunch of different puzzles all the time. So playing with lego <br/>
and sitting together with your knees touching and talking about which <br/>
color you need to build whatever structure you are building may get <br/>
you into a discussion about being a brick layer or a mason or it may <br/>
be a conversation about how you want whatever you are building to <br/>
look like or about how many thin bricks you need to balance out a <br/>
thick brick or maybe just about how the bumps feel under your <br/>
fingers. And none of that looks like learning, it just looks like two <br/>
people absorbed in a shared activity with a little bit of <br/>
conversation occasionally flowing between them. But there are pieces <br/>
of a lot of puzzles coming into play in that afternoon. There is a <br/>
huge amount of math going on, sorting and fractions and statistics <br/>
(if you are looking for a single color among many, how many pieces do <br/>
you have to look through to find the one--so distribution as well), <br/>
there is social learning, sideways conversations, there is trust <br/>
being learnt, the knowledge that a mom is someone who will sit and <br/>
sort and play and be just with you--a powerful piece of learning. <br/>
There is more that goes on in that moment, in that playful, <br/>
concentrating moment, than could possibly be going on if you were to <br/>
decide to study just one piece of that puzzle. And it builds on <br/>
itself. The knowledge that your son and you gain in a day of playing <br/>
and talking and being, it becomes a part of a whole picture of the <br/>
world. So, knowing that it takes 4 little bricks to make a whole <br/>
brick is a puzzle piece that can be used later when he is thinking <br/>
about it taking 4 quarters to make a dollar, maybe. Or seeing the <br/>
different distribution of bricks in time and space may be something <br/>
that can be applied to sorting a completely different order of things <br/>
at some other point. It all matters. It all is a part of knowledge <br/>
and thought and awareness and a part who he is and who he is becoming <br/>
just as it is a part of you and who you are becoming. <br/>
 <br/>
There is nothing that a unit study can give you that curiousity and <br/>
exploring can&#39;t--well except some sort of certificate of knowledge <br/>
transfer, I guess. I have two children who have learned without a <br/>
handed down design for, well, the eldest for 10 years now. In the <br/>
past week or so Simon (the eldest) has begun to read. He never once <br/>
asked to learn to read, he never once approached me with that desire. <br/>
He put together all of the tools and pieces to that puzzle in his own <br/>
way and in his own time and while the puzzle is in no way complete, <br/>
my puzzle is in no way complete, he has come to a point where he can <br/>
interpret English as a written word. Both he and his sister have a <br/>
relationship with numbers that is so intuitive, is so honest, I could <br/>
not have trained them for that. And they both recognize that <br/>
knowledge is not something that is handed down, they recognize that <br/>
knowledge is something you pick up, it is something that is tasted <br/>
and felt and defined by you, by the individual. And that is probably <br/>
the most important piece of any puzzle that they can carry.<br/>

Hi,My son turned 6yo. yesterday. So, i guess we are officially<br/>
unschoolers now. I wonder if i should do anything different? Sometimes<br/>
i want to say to him: You can learn anything you want but i want you<br/>
too want to learn something each day. Boy, that sounds dumb when i<br/>
write it down. I know he&#39;s learning all the time. I think what i&#39;m<br/>

<br/>
Here&#39;s another tool to use when you&#39;re feeling confused.  Say things  <br/>
in the very simplest way so you can really look at what you&#39;re  <br/>
saying.  This was written:  &quot;it&#39;s official/i&#39;m feeling Inactive as  <br/>

<br/>
Rephrase it until you see that what you want is to feel involved as  <br/>
his mother.  Be present with him, quietly and calmly.  Look at him  <br/>
directly.  Feel how he&#39;s feeling.  Do simple things to make things  <br/>
better.<br/>
