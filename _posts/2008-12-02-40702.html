<div id="ygrps-yiv-1830116099">13. When you offer a child choices, be sure they are real choices.  <br/>
Offer them choices as often as you can. Try to limit the &quot;have to&#39;s&quot;  <br/>
as much as you can. Frequently ask yourself, &quot;Is this really a &quot;have  <br/>
to&quot; situation or can we find some choices here?&quot;<br/>
