<div id="ygrps-yiv-1133402361">We are having trouble growing crystals with those commercial kits (several<br/>
of them now).  Now, dh and I are NOT idiots (&lt;G&gt;) in the science lab<br/>
department (he worked in a lab for over 8 years and I took enough science<br/>
and chemistry labs in college) but these kits don&#39;t seem to work for us.<br/>
<br/>
Problem #1:  following the directions with the boiled water has caused<br/>
melting of the plastic trays provided, and even with the water that hot we<br/>
cannot seem to get all of the original crystal material to dissolve.<br/>
<br/>
Problem#2:  plasticware provided seems to spring leaks at inopportune<br/>
moments (like when filled to the brim with deeply dyed liquid :( )<br/>
<br/>
Problem#3:  we pour the liquid over the rock, add the seed crystals, and<br/>
NOTHING HAPPENS!  Directions say crystals will grow in several hours;<br/>
nothing grows here for days.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone had any success at all with these kits and if so, any hints?<br/>
We&#39;re thinking of using glassware next time around to avoid the<br/>
melting/leaking part.  Dd is getting disappointed because she really wants<br/>
to grow some crystals.  It doesn&#39;t seem like it should be this hard.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1282226289">Would it be possible that your tap water has some minerals or chemicals like <br/>
chlorine in it that are interfering with the process? You might try distilled <br/>
water. Or spring water since it seems to work in caves ;-)<br/>
