<div id="ygrps-yiv-372856108">Wow - congratulations and that is awesome.<br/>
<br/>
I have only watched Oprah 3/4 times in my life (TV in the attic) when I was<br/>
pregnant and sick at my &quot;in-laws&quot; - it was Dr Phil on dealing with<br/>
boundaries - you seem awesome at them.<br/>
<br/>
I have travelled the world to get far from my extended family.  I LOVVVE<br/>
THEM - and I hate the gossip, continual chatter &quot;we talk about you/them<br/>
because we love you/them&quot; and I can&#39;t take it.  My mother was 16000 kms<br/>
away - she has now moved and brought her gossiping tongue with her to 100kms<br/>
away.  Maybe it&#39;s time to move!<br/>
<br/>
I read somewhere &quot;I don&#39;t want to hear it - it feels like poison in me&quot;,<br/>
that really made me understand that I need to be clear and have a strong<br/>
voice to say - &quot;I don&#39;t want to get involved, and I if they want me to know<br/>
something they&#39;ll tell me&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well done for being so firm!   It must serve you and bring you sanity!<br/>
<br/>
How did you say it btw?<br/>
<br/>
 Love<br/>
<br/>
Natalie<br/>
Love all. Serve all.  ~Sai Baba<br/>

I finally felt like I was a grown-up when I turned 30-<br/>
I stopped letting my family suck all of my mental and physical energy from<br/>
me. (extended, not immediate). My mother and grandfather are feuding and my<br/>
GF &quot;disowned&quot; her- it has been over 2 years now. It was hard to separate<br/>
myself since I am very close to both parties and live within a mile of each.<br/>
BUT- I told them I DID NOT want to discuss the situation with either of<br/>
them. Put them in shock a bit since I have always been the self-deemed<br/>
&quot;peacemaker&quot; and &quot;fixer&quot;. I just realized that if they choose to hate each<br/>
other and be stubborn and not take any blame, they can live with the<br/>
results- PBLLLTHTTHT (raspberries) howz that for grown-up?<br/>
Mom says I&#39;ve gotten nasty- HEE HEE - that makes me happy to hear. OH yeah-<br/>
we are planning to move within the next year. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love<br/>
them all fiercely, I just want to go far enough away so they cannot damage<br/>
my girls on a daily basis!<br/>
I also found a hidden self-confidence and self-esteem~<br/>
 I LOVED turning 30- wonder how fun 40 will be??<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the therapy.<br/>
