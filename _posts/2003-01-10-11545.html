<div id="ygrps-yiv-133092378">I have a sad homeschooling problem, but it&#39;s not my family.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s my friend.  Another mom of three.  Not on this list, not on any of the <br/>
lists.  Not unschooling, though I met her at an unschooling conference years <br/>
ago.<br/>
<br/>
Her husband is being a sadistic prick.  There&#39;s not nicer way to say it.   <br/>
For most of a year, when she&#39;s talked about divorce I&#39;ve talked her out of <br/>
it.  I was afraid it would cause the kids to be unceremoniously slammed into <br/>
school, cause her to have to find a job and move into an apartment (she&#39;s <br/>
trained as a teacher, but once people have homeschooled it&#39;s hard for many of <br/>
them to even THINK about going back into the classroom) and suffer knowing <br/>
that when the kids are with their dad he can be as unreasonably strict and <br/>
non-communicative as he wants to be.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s especially harsh with the middle child, who is most like his mother.  <br/>
Obvious situation.<br/>
<br/>
I like every member of this family individually.   All grouped up, it&#39;s a <br/>
mess.  The mom is really good with the kids, but the dad undermines and is <br/>
becoming more and more irrational.  Maybe it&#39;s mid-life crisis.  He&#39;s young, <br/>
though, 41.  Maybe it&#39;s some kind of mental illness but there is NO WAY he <br/>
will go for help on something like that.  He wouldn&#39;t even go to a marriage <br/>
counsellor unless it was a male Christian counsellor.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m a confidant of the mom, a haven for the kids, but I have a streak (or <br/>
a lump) of stabbing sadness and fear that their seeing our happy unschooling <br/>
is part of what&#39;s making them all so unhappy.  Their knowing that at OUR <br/>
house nobody is punished for not wanting to finish a piece of bread at dinner <br/>
is making their life worse.  Their knowing that at our house nobody is woken <br/>
up at 5:00 because a chore wasn&#39;t finished will contribute NOTHING to keeping <br/>
their family together.<br/>
<br/>
So I feel like a contributing factor.<br/>
<br/>
No sense feeling sorry for myself.  I&#39;m in a safe place with a sweet husband <br/>
and busy kids.  But out of the corner of my eye that disaster is playing <br/>
slowly out, and I&#39;ll have another phone conversation this afternoon, or one <br/>
in person tomorrow, and I won&#39;t know what to say or do to keep from making <br/>
things worse by just being me.  I would like to be a strength to my friend, <br/>

to homeschool and to parent to suit her husband just floods out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1554855047">Dear Sandra,<br/>
That is really a tough situation. I&#39;ve been there before, too. You have to be so careful about what you say or do...you never know what will offend or hurt. I&#39;ll be praying for you that you will say the right thing. Think about how grateful she is to have someone to confide in and get it off her chest. It&#39;s awesome that you&#39;re there for her and can give her support. Probably what she needs right now is just a friend...someone who listens non-judgementally and loves her unconditionally. Thank God you are there for her! hang in there, sweetie!<br/>
Hugs,<br/>

<br/>
I know it&#39;s cold comfort, but having seen your family at least gives those<br/>
kids a shot at being different with their own kids.<br/>
<br/>
And maybe, MAYBE, if she divorces him he&#39;ll be one of those dads who loses<br/>
interest in the kids at all. Maybe he&#39;ll find a new wife and she&#39;ll<br/>
discourage him from having the old kids around.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sandra, I&#39;m really sorry. That is really sad.  I wonder how helpful it <br/>
would be if Keith and this man were to become friendly, perhaps through the <br/>
two families getting together to socialize.  I don&#39;t know if that is even <br/>
feasible, but perhaps Keith could indirectly give this guy something to <br/>
chew on that would help him be kinder and more supportive to his <br/>
family.  Maybe not.  I really don&#39;t know how much influence men-friends <br/>
have on each other.<br/>
<br/>
But, while you may not be able to affect that sad situation, I can <br/>
personally say that you positively affect folks you don&#39;t even know!  You <br/>
don&#39;t need me to tell you that, but I bet if there&#39;s a scorecard somewhere <br/>
being kept on people to record how much they do to make the world a better <br/>
place, there&#39;s probably at least an entire file draw to hold yours.  (Did <br/>
that come across clearly?)<br/>
<br/>
I hope that things will get better for this family.<br/>

<br/>
I hadn&#39;t considered that comforting thought.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the kids would get braver, too, and be able someday to say &quot;It&#39;s bad <br/>
enough your unreasonable expectations broke up our family.  We are NOT <br/>
getting up at 4:30 to fix you breakfast, and you can do your own damned <br/>
laundry.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He makes the kids do all the family&#39;s laundry.  The two older kids alternate <br/>
weeks when their job is to clean the kitchen all week alone and without help. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I know it&#39;s cold comfort, but having seen your family at least gives those<br/>

They all really like Holly, and will probably remember her their whole lives.<br/>

much influence men-friends <br/>
have on each other. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The other mom suggested that.  They&#39;re both engineers. &lt;g&gt;  That doesn&#39;t mean <br/>
they would have much to talk about.  But the two times we&#39;ve socialized for <br/>
any length of time (not just kids&#39; birthday parties in public places, of <br/>
which there have been two when both dads were there), the other dad LAUGHED <br/>
really hard and really freely, at things Keith and I said.  Last time was a <br/>
surprise birthday party for him, and we played Encore, which is a game where <br/>
you think of and sing a bit of a song with a certain word or subject matter.  <br/>
He had a TON of fun.<br/>
<br/>
But when there&#39;s not company or when he&#39;s not company he&#39;s not as friendly or <br/>
fun.<br/>
<br/>
He will discount things we do or think because we&#39;re not Christian and he <br/>
considers himself a serious church-going Christian, although he hasn&#39;t <br/>
settled on a church since they moved back here 16 months ago.  So we&#39;re bad <br/>
influences, although he trusts us with his kids.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But, while you may not be able to affect that sad situation, I can <br/>
personally say that you positively affect folks you don&#39;t even know!  You <br/>

place, there&#39;s probably at least an entire file draw to hold yours.  (Did <br/>
that come across clearly?)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thank you very much.  I think there&#39;s positive influence on individuals in <br/>
this family, but the effect of the mom hanging out with me is probably not as <br/>
good for keeping the family together as if she were hanging around with <br/>
church ladies.<br/>
<br/>
I told her if it were my situation I would put the kids in school to save the <br/>
marriage, because if they split the kids will end up in school anyway.  And <br/>
if she stays they might not necessarily STAY in school.<br/>
<br/>
But the day the dad stole the playstation quietly and took it to work with <br/>
him without telling anyone because he hadn&#39;t gotten his way about the <br/>
punishment and the boy had had an asthma attack (which the dad sees as being <br/>
manipulative, and refuses to read any articles suggesting stress triggers <br/>
asthma)...   my reaction was not charitable.  <br/>
<br/>
I said &quot;I will bring Marty&#39;s playstation over there, and if [that dad] <br/>
TOUCHES it I will call the police.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Might not have been such a big deal, a gaming system, but the boy had saved <br/>
money and bought it himself, and had company coming over that day <br/>
specifically to play PS games.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why I said sadistic.  <br/>

When an insane person gets upset by my sanity, I do NOT need to act insane <br/>
to make them feel better.<br/>
and<br/>
Nice women should never stay in a relationship with an insane man.  Women <br/>
are not for hurting.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, stop being so frickin&#39; bend-over-backwards to that lunatic and the <br/>
way he&#39;s treating your friend!!!  He&#39;s insane and needs help or the kids <br/>
need to get out NOW.<br/>
<br/>
Frankly, those kids are learning that it&#39;s okay for a father to do childish <br/>
spiteful things and that the wife should support his actions as well as any <br/>
mental/emotional/etc abuse piled on her.  Last time I checked, that wasn&#39;t <br/>
a healthy message for a kid (much less the woman) to get.<br/>
<br/>
While I don&#39;t know their situation personally, my gut reaction is that if <br/>
he won&#39;t go for help (psych or chemical) she should leave immediately and <br/>
homeschool as long as the alimony and child support lasts (usually 1/2 the <br/>
length of the marriage and until the kid&#39;s 18, no?) or find a way to work <br/>
from home.  Nobody&#39;s doing those kids ANY favors by keeping them in that <br/>
environment.<br/>

Homes like these are how abusers are made.<br/>

<br/>
There was a discussion somewhere about speaking up and intervening on<br/>
behalf of kids who were being hit and you said (paraphrasing) that even<br/>
one person giving a child the idea that hitting isn&#39;t right might come to<br/>
make a difference in their lives and in the way they eventually treat<br/>
their own kids.<br/>
<br/>
Your family being an example of peaceful kindness and love might be the<br/>
thing that saves them all from believing they deserve such treatment and<br/>
from that pattern of abuse.<br/>
<br/>
You and your family aren&#39;t the ones hurting those kids.<br/>
<br/>
There probably is something wrong with him and I would be afraid it could<br/>
accelerate and he could end up physically hurting one of them.    She<br/>
should get herself and her kids someplace safe, and then worry about<br/>
working on the marriage if she thinks it can be saved.    When he doesn&#39;t<br/>
have the power to frighten them anymore maybe he&#39;ll be more willing to be<br/>
reasonable.  Or not.   If he&#39;s sick, he&#39;s not responsible, but those kids<br/>
still need to be safe. <br/>
<br/>
Help her find a place to go and maybe aid of some kind.   Have her make a<br/>
record of some of the unreasonable things he&#39;s done and why she&#39;s<br/>
concerned for her kids emotional health when he&#39;s around.<br/>
Help her find a lawyer, and maybe a cover school if she needs one for<br/>
appearances.   She&#39;s probably feeling too overwhelmed to think straight. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hey, not all of them are the weirdo male-dominant type, believe it or not.  <br/>
We found a Christian counselor through Focus On the Family who was rather <br/>
mainstream in his ideas of therapy.  I know FOTF gets a bad rap (even from <br/>
me), but they have a network, you know? Maybe she could call and get a few <br/>
names and then call around.  Maybe ask him what church he attends, and pick <br/>
one who is Episcopalian or something liberal like that.  Her husband doesn&#39;t <br/>
have to know that going in.  <br/>
<br/>
And of course, one way to get someone to counseling who doesn&#39;t want to go is <br/>
to ask them to go to help YOU get better.  Maybe that will work, but he does <br/>
sound pretty irrational.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to watch that kind of train wreck.  None of it is your fault.  Your <br/>
example and ideas will be a beacon for her later, after.  It&#39;s really nice of <br/>
you to care about your impact on them.<br/>

mental/emotional/etc abuse piled on her.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I realize that reading a novel isn&#39;t much of a substitute for therapy,<br/>
but I really like the young adult novel Ironman, by Chris Crutcher.  The<br/>
story is about a teen struggling with the anger he feels towards his<br/>
domineering dad.  The parents in this book have been divorced, but the<br/>
mother actually apologizes to the son for staying with the father and<br/>
letting him act abusively (not hitting) towards the son as long as she<br/>
did.  It&#39;s a pretty cool book.  <br/>
<br/>
The main character is competing in a triathalon and his dad actually<br/>
works against him &quot;to teach him a lesson&quot;. The dad is clearly trying to<br/>
break his son&#39;s spirit so that his son will never be stronger than he is.<br/>

&lt;&lt; And maybe, MAYBE, if she divorces him he&#39;ll be one of those dads who loses<br/>
interest in the kids at all. Maybe he&#39;ll find a new wife and she&#39;ll<br/>
discourage him from having the old kids around. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I hadn&#39;t considered that comforting thought.**<br/>
<br/>
Continuing the string of IFs:<br/>
<br/>
IF she has full custody and if her divorce decree doesn&#39;t prevent it,<br/>
she could look for a teaching job in another state, on purpose.  <br/>

&lt;&lt; Help her find a place to go and maybe aid of some kind.   Have her make a<br/>
record of some of the unreasonable things he&#39;s done and why she&#39;s<br/>
concerned for her kids emotional health when he&#39;s around.<br/>
Help her find a lawyer, and maybe a cover school if she needs one for<br/>
appearances.   She&#39;s probably feeling too overwhelmed to think straight.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
She did speak with a lawyer, and I helped her make a list of questions to <br/>
ask.  The lawyer said what she has is insufficient to charge him with abuse.  <br/>
I&#39;m pressing for medical neglect, on his not understanding asthma, and being <br/>
unwilling to read what she brings home.  That&#39;s the boy he&#39;s harsh with, the <br/>
asthmatic.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have cover school things in New Mexico.  Clonlara would be her <br/>
closest option.  The dad is pressing to get the oldest child into Albuquerque <br/>
Academy.  Expensive, exclusive, she doesn&#39;t want to go, he&#39;s ignoring her.  <br/>
His younger brothers have kids in fancy schools.  This is all about him <br/>
having something to say when he&#39;s visiting at his mom&#39;s.  She wants to study <br/>
art.  He doesn&#39;t care.  He wants her to do academics.<br/>

I think I&#39;ll get it for them.   <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a possibility of them getting into a study involving asthma and <br/>
stress that the university or the medical school is doing here.  I think that <br/>
is a GREAT idea!!!!  He&#39;ll pretty much have to read about it then.  And at <br/>
least, there would be some kind of chart or report structure for them to say <br/>
what leve of stress was in the house.  He&#39;s an engineer.  Maybe knowing he w<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thank you Heidi!  I kept reading the digest, and<br/>
hoping that someone would adress this point and<br/>
wondering if I would have to send something myself to<br/>
this effect.  I know Sandra has the common sense to<br/>
know this is not her fault or her responsibility, as I<br/>
have heard her give similar advice to others.  But<br/>
it&#39;s hard to see clearly when you are emotionally<br/>
involved, and easy to lose sight of simple truths in<br/>
the face of complex neurosis.  I feel that staying in<br/>
a bad marriage &quot;for the sake of the children&quot; is<br/>
always a bad idea, and worse for the children.  Like<br/>
leaving a wound to fester, because treating it would<br/>
hurt.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t feel bad for being yourself Sandra!  Your self<br/>
is a strong, caring, thoughtful, dynamic person.  Feel<br/>
GOOD about the example you are giving to those kids<br/>
(and the Keith is giving to them!) about what a family<br/>
CAN be like.  Feel GOOD about being an ear for your<br/>
friend, and a shoulder, and NOT ANOTHER BRICK IN HER<br/>
WALL, pardon the stolen phrase.  Her marriage is on<br/>
the rocks, maybe it needs to die it&#39;s natural death<br/>
for all parties involved to move on to healtheir<br/>
things.  Maybe this man&#39;s behavior is a cry for help<br/>
getting out of a life he is unhappy with.  Whatever<br/>
their reality may be, it is none of your doing.<br/>
<br/>
A dear friend of mine recently ended her marriage of<br/>
20+ years with her husband, who was doing similar<br/>
insane things.  She says that now that they live in<br/>
different cities and have moved on in their lives, his<br/>
is a much healthier and happier person.  They are<br/>
friends now, and talk on the phone, and she is amazed<br/>
at the difference in him, and happy for his new life. <br/>
Her life, of course, is also much more serene and<br/>
happy without someone manufacturing drama and abuses<br/>
for her.  It was time for them to move on.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Last time I checked, that wasn&#39;t a healthy message<br/>
&gt;for a kid (much less the woman) to get.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here here.  <br/>
<br/>
Where there is a will, there is a way.  I know there<br/>
are homeschooling single mom&#39;s out there, some who are<br/>
sole breadwinners.  The kids will need to be a part of<br/>
the solution, and the family (mom and kids) will have<br/>
to pull together to get through if they choose to<br/>
leave him, but it&#39;s not impossible.<br/>

Thanks, Nanci.<br/>
<br/>
Last week I suggested she talk honestly about this with her 13 year old <br/>
daughter, who will be 14 in February.  It had not occurred to her to do so.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not just the dad, then, perpetuating a tradition in which kids aren&#39;t <br/>
treated as members or parts of the situation.   <br/>

Does she have a cool pediatrician for her kids who could &quot;prescribe&quot; &quot;No<br/>

PS  (I&#39;m a retired engineer myself.  At my workplace they used to say<br/>
&quot;what gets measured gets done.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
PPS (A scientific thing that could be graphed is the boy&#39;s Peak Flow<br/>
(lung capacity).  You blow into a special device called a peak flow<br/>
meter to measure this.  This is helpful in understanding whether the<br/>
airways are open and functioning normally, or are starting to constrict.<br/>
 Doing this daily and tracking the results is a good way to know when<br/>
more medicine is required, and it is helpful in figuring out what one&#39;s<br/>

I suggested she ask the doctor for literature.  She talked to him on the <br/>
phone and he gave her websites.  I think next time she should take her <br/>
husband with her and get the doctor to say those things.  The husband was <br/>
just here, picking some stuff up with their daughter.  He is SO sweet and <br/>
charming in isolation (and visiting).  Very loveable.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-824949982">In regard to the suggestion that Keith have a talk with him, it might work.<br/>
The two or three times in my life I have had these conversations they helped<br/>
but, *they were very difficult*.  I rehearsed my lines many times and I knew<br/>
that it could all blow up in my face. So I had to weigh was it worth losing<br/>
one of my closest friends to point out to him that he was destroying his<br/>
relationship with his kids?  Kids I didn&#39;t even know very well. It was a<br/>
tough choice. If he took it wrong, we would no longer be friends and he<br/>
would still be on the path to destruction.<br/>
<br/>
You (Sandra) say that this guy trusts his kids with your family. That would<br/>
most assuredly change if Keith&#39;s talk goes badly. I wouldn&#39;t want to be the<br/>
one to ask Keith to have the talk. But, if he won&#39;t go to counseling the<br/>
only counseling he will get is from friends.<br/>
<br/>
Do the kids see the mom sticking up for them? That seems to be the most<br/>
important thing to establish before any moves are made.<br/>
<br/>
He seems to be using a different script than hers. If the kids really do<br/>
come first for her, he needs to *know* that. I have meet some very dense<br/>
guys through the years that didn&#39;t see the divorce coming. If it is clear to<br/>
him that what ever ill-conceived power struggle he is having with the kids<br/>
will cost him the family he will either change because he values them (wife<br/>
and kids) or he won&#39;t and she will know what little value she and the kids<br/>
are to him and hopefully move on to doing whatever is necessary to protect<br/>
them. It has to come to this or it will only get worse.<br/>
<br/>
From this point it all looks ugly to me.<br/>
<br/>
It must be tough for you to see all the potential good in this guy.<br/>
