<div id="ygrps-yiv-338693006">I&#39;m sitting right in front of a little fan in Kirby&#39;s room, watching  a PBS <br/>
interview about the new Tomb Raider movie (kind of) and resting after doing <br/>
another pass on steam cleaning the carpet in the library, for Kirby&#39;s birthday.<br/>
<br/>
I got a steam cleaning machine for my birthday, kind of &lt;g&gt;.  But that&#39;s a <br/>
two-car-garage-sized room and hasn&#39;t been cleaned (except vacuuming) for a long <br/>
time.   <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s boring. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Marty and Holly are a couple of miles away with eight or so friends, to play <br/>
orc ball.  Today they&#39;re being photographed for some local sports newspaper <br/>
I&#39;ve never seen.  Marty thought he was going to be asked to write up the history <br/>
and rules of the game, but they&#39;ve already interviewed him so he didn&#39;t need <br/>
to write it himself.  He wasn&#39;t worried about it, though.  He was very matter <br/>
of fact both ways.  So his first-ever report being for publication didn&#39;t <br/>
scare him, and he seemed to show no disappointment or relief at finding he didn&#39;t <br/>
need to.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday he and Holly and I went to thrift stores looking for &quot;uniforms&quot; for <br/>
them.  He had hoped for short-sleeved button-up shirts, some green and some <br/>
blue, and didn&#39;t find what he wanted.  But he DID find five black net loose <br/>
over-shirt things specifically for team-marking.  Does anyone know what those are <br/>
called?  He&#39;s interested in buying some more, but two big sporting goods <br/>
stores didn&#39;t have any.<br/>
<br/>
So the teams are usually five people and that was perfect, and he decided the <br/>
cheapest quickest other thing would be to get some white mens&#39; t-shirts and <br/>
dye them gold or green.<br/>
<br/>
Then Holly said if he got white t-shirts for everyone, some could have black <br/>
over and some not, but then they wouldn&#39;t have to switchback and forth if <br/>
everybody had a white t-shirt on.  And lots of them already have white t-shirts.  <br/>
So he bought five extra just in case (used).<br/>
<br/>
I made them both lunch while they were waiting for the other players, but I <br/>
didn&#39;t eat. Then Keith came in and ate leftovers while I was doing carpet and <br/>
so I haven&#39;t eaten.<br/>
<br/>
They all went off in white a while ago.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby is at work at the gaming shop.  He drove himself, but I have to go to <br/>
ride next to him (learner&#39;s permit) and bring the van home.<br/>
<br/>
Keith helped a friend in Belen (south of here half an hour) load a moving <br/>
van.  The friend&#39;s car is in our back yard for a few days.  He brought back a few <br/>
pieces of garage furniture and oddments.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I like these days where people are doing important things and are scattered <br/>
out.  I like the all-together days, too, but as the kids are getting older I&#39;m <br/>
coming to really appreciate seeing them use the house as a base of interesting <br/>
operations.<br/>
<br/>
Oh.  I went to Cost Plus to buy some Japanese snack food.  Party mixes of <br/>
cute various rice-cakey things, and one that said &quot;nuts&quot; but looks like nuts I <br/>
never saw before.  Some new teaspoons because we are low on teaspoons.   And ten <br/>
packs of Pocky which we plan to put out in pretty goblets.  And he wants an <br/>
ice cream cake.  So that&#39;s Tuesday.   He&#39;ll have people from gaming, anime, <br/>
karate, homeschooling and SCA.  Some of those overlap two groups and a couple <br/>
overlap three (other SCA homeschooler gamers).  I expect there&#39;ll be 20 or 25 <br/>
extra people.  Some are coming from Los Alamos, some of the group he went to the <br/>
prom with.  There will be at least two from Santa Fe, and maybe six.  Some are <br/>
coming from the east side of the mountains, Stanley and Edgewood.  Some might <br/>
spend the night, probably the girls from Los Alamos.  I think it&#39;s slightly <br/>
over half males, because the gaming shop and karate class have more male <br/>
participants.<br/>
