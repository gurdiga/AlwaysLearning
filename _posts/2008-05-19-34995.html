Any attempt to define a subject is an attempt to get at the heart of  <br/>
what that subject is. For instance: �What is human language?� or  <br/>
�What is math... at bottom... beyond the symbols?� These are very  <br/>
difficult questions to answer�especially for the non-Christian.<br/>

someone would have noticed &quot;textboook&quot;!  They clearly aren&#39;t selling  <br/>
