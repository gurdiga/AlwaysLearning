<br/>
&lt;&lt;Woops!  That&#39;s hear ,   not here.  Dang.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But speaking of &quot;ratting...&quot;<br/>
Holly is finding it hard to fathom that some parents punish or criticize kids <br/>
for tattling.  First she had to hear what &quot;tattle&quot; meant, and she said &quot;Even <br/>
if it&#39;s telling them that a kid is in danger?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I told her some parents are just not clear themselves about what is good <br/>
information and what is trying to get other kids in trouble, and so some <br/>
parents, to make it easier on *them* have a blanket rule against &quot;tattling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s appalled.<br/>
<br/>
Good for her and her possible future kids.<br/>
