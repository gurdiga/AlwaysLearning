<div id="ygrps-yiv-1349606735">I&#39;m with you on that one Sharon (I got a good laugh out of what you said)...<br/>
I was just thinking today how I&#39;m going to cover up all the dirty, stained<br/>
marks in our expensive carpet when people come to look at the house to<br/>
purchase it.  We already have a kids rug that they play with cars on so I<br/>
was thinking about who I know that would lend me one of their rugs to cover<br/>
up some of the other things that have been spilled on our Berber carpet and<br/>
will not come out!!!<br/>
<br/>
Dawn<br/>
<br/>
We have not learned how to avoid distressing<br/>
<br/>
furniture.....but don&#39;t know how to make get paid for<br/>
<br/>
it. Do you suppose there might be a market for<br/>
<br/>
distressed carpet?<br/>

It&#39;s called FOLEX Instant Carpet Spot Remover.<br/>
I bought it at Walmart. A big bottle for $4.99.<br/>
It&#39;s non-toxic and has no irritating smell and it really works on even old stains. My sister had some stains that she&#39;s been trying to get out for years and she tried Folex and it finally did the trick.<br/>
<br/>
Your info-mmercial for the day. :-)<br/>

<br/>
I needed to know that!<br/>
<br/>
And Kirby said to me yesterday, &quot;We need to just go to Walmart.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is Kirby who no longer has time to shop, and who no longer likes to go <br/>
out and just hang out in public with his mom or family much.  He wants me to <br/>
take him to Walmart.  I don&#39;t remember why. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re also going grocery shopping, for his meatball dish and the cake he&#39;s <br/>
making for tomorrow night.  <br/>
<br/>
I can share with him the fascination of buying carpet-stain remover.<br/>

I really hope the Folex works for you.<br/>
One tip, especially for set-in, old stains, you may have to reapply 2 or 3 times before the stain goes away. But keep trying this way until it does. I watched my sister do this to a years-old stain of spilled essential oil on her white carpet, which she had tried every product out there on it. But she kept persisting with the Folex and the stain really did come out. Good luck to you!<br/>
