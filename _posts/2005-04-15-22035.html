aaaahhhh----I don&#39;t buy this one.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe in spanking. I have done it too. But as soon as I knew <br/>
better, I DID better. And never did it again.<br/>
<br/>
I really think the spanking thing is EASY to stop.<br/>
<br/>
It may be my first reaction to things (ingrained since childhood), but <br/>
it takes more than one step/one thought/one motion to GET there, so I <br/>
can stop myself from actually DOing it.<br/>
<br/>
To spank, you have to have a hold of the child, raise your hand, and <br/>
swat---and that&#39;s if everything is *right* there. So somewhere in <br/>
between, I can get a grip on myself and s-t-o-p. It&#39;s gotten so easy <br/>
over the years, I don&#39;t even have to think about it anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Yellling&#39;s a different story. Opening my mouth is the only step needed! <br/>
&lt;g&gt; So now I remember to breeeeeathe before I utter a word. Finding <br/>
that tool is still difficult because it&#39;s an *extra* step. With <br/>
spanking, I had three or more steps to go through to stop hitting.<br/>
<br/>
As for unschooling. Believing in it and understanding it are pretty <br/>
deep ideas/thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
I think someone can believe that it&#39;s possible to do---that there is a <br/>
positive outcome. Someone can understand that natural learning makes <br/>
sense. And I think you can &#39;fake it &#39;til you make it&#39; by going through <br/>
the motions and stopping curricula and grading and testing and <br/>
comparisons and other school-think & -do.<br/>
<br/>
But that is nowhere NEAR *getting* it and believing in it and <br/>
understanding it. I don&#39;t think you can get to *that* point until <br/>
well.... you&#39;re *past* that point and know down deep in your soul that <br/>
learning is natural. That coerced learning damages natural learning. <br/>
That each child is an individual who shouldn&#39;t and can&#39;t be measured.<br/>
<br/>
I think you have to really believe it right down to your toes or you&#39;re <br/>
just spouting off about something that you think might work. Maybe. <br/>
Under the right circumstances. With the right kid.<br/>
<br/>
~Kelly, who believes it down deep in her soul and all the way to the <br/>
tips of her toes!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have only in the last year gotten to the point where it was EASY to<br/>
stop, and never do it again.  Before, it was easy to stop the first<br/>
time in a day, but if things kept going poorly, the hint of it was in<br/>
the back of my mind, and sometimes I gave in to that.<br/>
<br/>
And if my child was near, I might not spank him, but I might touch him<br/>
roughly, which was just as bad and scary, and could be done in an instant.<br/>
<br/>
The thing that finally made spanking easy to stop was the whole<br/>
peaceful parenting thing -- when I didn&#39;t have to control my child&#39;s<br/>
behavior, I didn&#39;t have to spank.  Then I could open up to lots of<br/>
other skills, like talking and being honest with myself and admitting<br/>
when I couldn&#39;t do it all.<br/>
<br/>
And when I made the decision to stop, forever, Pam Sorooshian&#39;s<br/>
NoMoreSpanking list really helped me work through what I needed.<br/>

Just in case there&#39;s anyone else out there who can relate.<br/>
