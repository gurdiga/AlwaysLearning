We used to play Harry Potter trivia on the Scholastic site together years<br/>
ago, maybe that helped? We&#39;d play together and use the books - I think<br/>
the game covered the first 3. It was a lot of fun, but now the<br/>
scholastic.com site is down so I can&#39;t see if it&#39;s still there, but if it<br/>
is you would just go to scholastic.com, then Harry Potter, then trivia..<br/>
<br/>
And now you&#39;ve got me yearning for Book 5 again, just when I&#39;d almost<br/>
managed to forget...<br/>
