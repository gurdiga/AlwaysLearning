<div id="ygrps-yiv-1620963712">One of the struggles I am having with unschooling parenting is what  <br/>
to do when I feel my children have or are behaving inappropriately in  <br/>
a public setting or when in someone else&#39;s home.  I want them to have  <br/>
freedom of choosing their own behavior, but at times &quot;I&quot; feel they  <br/>
have crossed the line of acceptable and I fight this urge to jump  <br/>
right in there and tell them what they need to be doing.<br/>
<br/>
So here is what happened tonight.  We had met another family out at a  <br/>
rec hall to play some games.  All of the kids were running around and  <br/>
having a good time and I was explaining to the other dad how to play  <br/>
this game we brought.  My 8yo dd was playing under the table and  <br/>
started taking the chairs and flipping them on their sides and making  <br/>
a fort.  The other dad, honestly thinking that dd was struggling to  <br/>
turn the chairs back up right, &quot;helped&quot; her by taking her chairs that  <br/>
she has specifically put the way she wanted and put them back  <br/>
upright.  Well you would have thought that the world had come to an  <br/>
end.  She shot up and started screaming and saying all kinds of very  <br/>
inappropriate things, and saying them in such a way that they were  <br/>
meant directly for this dad.  In other words, she wasn&#39;t just  <br/>
venting, she was bitching at him.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I knew where she was coming from and have much experience with  <br/>
her in these types of outbursts within our own family and close  <br/>
friends who seem to understand her a bit more, but this was someone  <br/>
new in our lives and I just didn&#39;t know what to do.  I went over to  <br/>
her and found out what was wrong, although I already knew.  I  <br/>
expressed to her the way she spoke to the dad was unacceptable and  <br/>
she owed him an apology.  Well I haven&#39;t done this in quite a while.   <br/>
I can&#39;t stand the &quot;now say your sorry in a sing-song voice but don&#39;t  <br/>
really mean it&quot; apology.  But I really felt in this instance, she  <br/>
owed him an apology.  I have been asking myself lately (thanks to  <br/>
some great advice) &quot;would I say this to or ask this of my husband or  <br/>
a friend&quot; and I have to answer in this situation - yes.  If my friend  <br/>
acted that way to another one of our friends, i think I would say  <br/>
&quot;girl, you owe him an apology&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
So anyhow, dd doesn&#39;t like to be put on the spot, especially with  <br/>
someone she isn&#39;t familiar with.  I have her come back over with me  <br/>
to the table and sit beside of me (across from him) and ask her when  <br/>
she is ready she can apologize.  At this point I just feel awful.  I  <br/>
do not like what i am doing with her, but feel like I had gotten  <br/>
myself into a situation I didn&#39;t know how to get out of.  While she  <br/>
was sitting, the dad and I continue on with our game and she starts  <br/>
crying.  She doesn&#39;t want to talk to him.  I probably wouldn&#39;t either  <br/>
if I were in her situation (yes, I know the situation that I  <br/>
created).  Finally I told her that if she would like to write it on  <br/>
paper that would be fine, she didn&#39;t have to talk to him.  A few  <br/>
minutes passed and she wrote it down and I gave it to him and he  <br/>
wrote her a sweet note back.  Dd and I hugged and then she ran off  <br/>
and stated playing like nothing had happened.<br/>
<br/>
How do you handle this?  When your child is rude to another.  And I  <br/>
don&#39;t mean they forgot to say please, but really really nasty with  <br/>
another person.  A similar situation happened (not this the whole  <br/>
apologizing thing, but rude behavior) when we were staying at my in- <br/>
laws for the night and my two boys were taking a bath together in  <br/>
Grandma and Grandpa&#39;s big giant wonderful tub in their perfect  <br/>
house.  &lt;g&gt;  They were getting wilder and wilder and the water was  <br/>
slashing wider and higher making big spots all over their non-tiled  <br/>
walls and I repeatedly asked them to calm down, made a bunch of idle  <br/>
threats and finally because my FIL was about to have a coronary in  <br/>
the other room, I turned into mean mommy and the rest of the night  <br/>
was a disaster.<br/>
<br/>
Should I have certain standards or expectations or whatever when it  <br/>
comes to other people and their stuff and how my kids treat them?  I  <br/>
know in both situations and other similar ones, part of MY problem is  <br/>
that I feel as if I am being heavily judged by the offended person  <br/>
and there is a part of me that worries what they think of how I am  <br/>
handling the situation.  The other part of me just doesn&#39;t care, but  <br/>
mostly I wonder &quot;are there limits&quot;?  What to do?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s choosing from a reasonable range of behaviors, and choosing  <br/>
from an unlimited range.  There are almost always real-life  <br/>
limitations to what&#39;s acceptable (safe, polite, legal) in any given  <br/>
place and time, and moms have a responsibility to keep their kids  <br/>
within that range.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
I agree with you.  There are other ways to deal with it, though.  You  <br/>
might have apologized for her, explained in as neutral a way as you  <br/>
could, found some chairs she COULD turn on their sides (IF that was a  <br/>
good idea; the rec manager might have thought no).<br/>
<br/>
-=-I told her that if she would like to write it on<br/>
<br/>
paper that would be fine, she didn&#39;t have to talk to him. A few<br/>
minutes passed and she wrote it down and I gave it to him and he<br/>
wrote her a sweet note back. Dd and I hugged and then she ran off<br/>
and stated playing like nothing had happened.-=-<br/>
<br/>
That seems like a pretty cool solution!<br/>
<br/>
-=-Should I have certain standards or expectations or whatever when  <br/>
it comes to other people and their stuff and how my kids treat them? -=-<br/>
<br/>
Yes, absolutely.<br/>
<br/>
(Anyone who disagrees with my answer on that, don&#39;t bring your kids  <br/>
to visit my house--seriously.)<br/>
<br/>
-=-part of MY problem is<br/>
<br/>
that I feel as if I am being heavily judged by the offended person<br/>
and there is a part of me that worries what they think of how I am<br/>
handling the situation.-=-<br/>
<br/>
But they are.  Every time we make a choice where other people are,  <br/>
they see it and they have an opinion.  That can&#39;t be helped.<br/>
<br/>
If you let your kids damage someone else&#39;s stuff, you helped them,  <br/>
pretty effectively, so it&#39;s more than a judgment of your tone of  <br/>
voice and handling.  It&#39;s whether  YOU care about the other person&#39;s  <br/>
stuff.  I have a guitar out in the living room right now, leaning up  <br/>
in a corner, not in a case.  We&#39;ve only had teens and older here for  <br/>
a long time, and I&#39;m not worried about it, but if little kids came  <br/>
over and I forgot the guitar was there and the mom didn&#39;t move  <br/>
QUICKLY to get between  her kids and the guitar, I&#39;d be cranky with  <br/>
the mom.  If I thought about it I&#39;d take the guitar where kids  <br/>
couldn&#39;t see it, and put out some kid-safe instruments.<br/>
<br/>
-=-The other part of me just doesn&#39;t care, but<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Other people&#39;s property is important.<br/>
<br/>
The peace of another person&#39;s house is theirs.   If they want so much  <br/>
peace you can&#39;t have a pleasant visit at all, then they might lose  <br/>
the privilege of seeing you.<br/>
<br/>
When mine were small and the grandparents were nervous about their  <br/>
noise and movement, we figured out that public places were best, or  <br/>
out in the yard.  Miniature golf in Ruidoso, children&#39;s museum in  <br/>
Albuquerque, the little zoo and train in Alamogordo, where they live-- <br/>
any of those neutral and kid-friendly places were safer and better  <br/>
places to hang out.  The kids could be quick and loud AND impress the  <br/>
grandparents with their cleverness, and the house was safe and quiet  <br/>
meanwhile.<br/>

*********<br/>
That&#39;s what I have done too , remove *delicate* items. <br/>
 <br/>
But what about a situation where you can&#39;t move something? <br/>
Like the couch. I know it&#39;s fun to jump on couches, but the fact is ,I  don&#39;t <br/>
*want* other kids jumping on our couch when they are at our  house.  My kids <br/>
even get annoyed when they see it, but yet wouldn&#39;t  say anything &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;.<br/>
 <br/>
We have one good couch in the main room of the house. We all want it to  stay <br/>
fairly good-looking for *us*, and we don&#39;t have money to go buy another  one.<br/>
My own kids don&#39;t even jump on our couch.  Instead, there are mini  <br/>
trampolines, and mattresses, cushions and pillows to jump on. <br/>
 <br/>
So what do you do when other kids jump on your furniture, and you don&#39;t  want <br/>
them to?, especially if these parents are trying to *get* unschooling? <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; She even asked me if I could tell him.  I don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t,  <br/>
&gt; it just didn&#39;t seem right.  I thought that she said all of the mean  <br/>
&gt; word, she can say the apology.  The chairs were never the problem,  <br/>
&gt; neither of us had a problem with what she was doing, he just didn&#39;t  <br/>
&gt; know what she was doing and thought she needed help getting them up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Other people&#39;s property is important.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; So with my boys taking a very splashy bath.  What to do there.  We  <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t have a tub, so it is a big novelty to take a big bubbly bath  <br/>
&gt; and want for them to be able to do that.  I personally feel the my  <br/>
&gt; in-laws are way over the top when it come to keeping their stuff  <br/>
&gt; perfect.  So I agree with my kids.  But it isn&#39;t our stuff.  The  <br/>
&gt; kids wouldn&#39;t stop what they were doing, no matter how I asked  <br/>
&gt; them.  It seemed at the time, the only way for me to resolve this  <br/>
&gt; situation was to become the type of mom I don&#39;t want to be.  And  <br/>
&gt; the kids don&#39;t want it either as the rest of the evening was a  <br/>
&gt; disaster.  I was grumpy, they were pissed and it just kept  <br/>
&gt; escalating out of control.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;The peace of another person&#39;s house is theirs. If they want so much<br/>
&gt; peace you can&#39;t have a pleasant visit at all, then they might lose<br/>
&gt; the privilege of seeing you.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Almost two years ago, dh and I made the decision that we couldn&#39;t  <br/>
&gt; stay with his parents anymore due to this very fact.  We hadn&#39;t  <br/>
&gt; planned on staying the night.  The kids had been there all day and  <br/>
&gt; when we came to pick them up, we got suckered into staying there.   <br/>
&gt; Oh well, lesson learned - again!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Another issue I have is my boys are very physical with each other  <br/>
&gt; and wrestle constantly.  In the living room, in the yard, in the  <br/>
&gt; library, in the park, in the line at the grocery store...  I talk  <br/>
&gt; with them about inside and outside places and they can&#39;t do it here  <br/>
&gt; or there, but can here and there.  I think maybe I need to give  <br/>
&gt; them a task to focus on.  Maybe that would keep them distracted.   <br/>
&gt; If you have seen Ice Age 2, my boys are just like those two possum  <br/>
&gt; brothers!  They are 6 & 9, and I think old enough to be better in  <br/>
&gt; control of their bodies.  But it is very frustrating and I find  <br/>
&gt; myself not able to focus on the task at hand, like looking for a  <br/>
&gt; specific type of grocery when they are head butting each other in  <br/>
&gt; the isle!<br/>

even get annoyed when they see it, but yet wouldn&#39;t say anything  <br/>
&lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Say &quot;Get off the couch.&quot;  Say it to homeless guys who might wander in  <br/>
and jump on your couch.  Say it to three-year-olds whose moms aren&#39;t  <br/>
polite or with-it enough to beat you to it.  It&#39;s your couch!!<br/>
<br/>
Say &quot;If you want to jump, there&#39;s a trampoline out back.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If they shoot you a dirty look or the mom starts jabbering on about  <br/>
her child&#39;s self expression...<br/>
<br/>
Well what I&#39;d do is say &quot;Get out of my house and don&#39;t come back.&quot;   <br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t want people doing that to my couch&quot; (or guitar, or stove, or  <br/>
car, or flower bed, or TV... that&#39;s plenty to cause bad behavior to  <br/>
stop right then, and right there.<br/>
<br/>
There was someone who came to another discussion list years back, and  <br/>
she was of a philosophy (not very widespread or successful as far as  <br/>
I&#39;ve seen) of figuring out how kids could do whatever on earth they  <br/>
wanted to do.  She assured us all that if she came to visit that if  <br/>
her children wanted to walk on our coffee tables, she would try to  <br/>
figure out a way to persuade us to let them.  I told her not to come  <br/>
to my house.  I did talk to someone later who had visited with her  <br/>
and her children (I don&#39;t remember in whose home, or what) but the  <br/>
reports were NOT positive.<br/>
<br/>
My kids would have been very careful with anyone else&#39;s coffee table,  <br/>
or Ninja Turtles, or Barbie clothes, or swingset, because we had  <br/>
practiced at home being careful with other people&#39;s things.  It  <br/>
didn&#39;t have to do with rules or threats, it had to do with  <br/>
understanding and caring about the principles involved in being good  <br/>
people who will be welcomed into places and situations, and probably  <br/>
invited back (or praised, or hired, as years passed).<br/>
<br/>
There is nothing whatsoever in unschooling that suggests that it&#39;s  <br/>
okay to behave badly in public or to misuse other people&#39;s things.<br/>

+++++<br/>
My kids  would never even think of jumping on other people&#39;s  couches, etc<br/>
cuz they respect our,and other people&#39;s,belongings.<br/>
 <br/>
But i think some people,in their journey to *get* unschooling and put it  <br/>
into practice, think it IS ok for their child to do just about everything. They  <br/>
believe if their child *wants* to do it, then they should go along with  it.<br/>
 <br/>
There have been times in the past that I said nothing and held my breath  and <br/>
just waited for the visit to be over but never wanted them back.<br/>
 <br/>
Another time I was asked if i minded (after it went on for quite awhile  <br/>
already)<br/>
 and I unfortunately said no, which was sooo wrong cuz I did mind. It  was <br/>
awkward to be put on the spot.<br/>
 <br/>
But it&#39;s up to ME to say how I feel and I feel better prepared <br/>
for a next time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-430769214">The other thing that can be very helpful is to have an inexhaustible <br/>
mental list of &quot;things that would be more fun than...&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
If you have a few games to play while you&#39;re waiting in line at the <br/>
checkout, and you start playing them *before* your guys start <br/>
wrestling, you might be able to avoid the problem.  These can be <br/>
things like the No Materials Games (linked on the math section?), or <br/>
things that channel their energy in a less-damaging direction (we <br/>
play &quot;Can You Jump This High?&quot; with my hand up in the air).<br/>
<br/>
If the kids are splashing in the tub, offer something better (this is <br/>
hard, I know, when it&#39;s something as fun as splashing).  Bring <br/>
shaving cream to spray on the water and mess with, or a spray bottle <br/>
(this would only help if there&#39;s a tub surround, but if there is, <br/>
then it helps to direct the splashing), or put ice in the tub to play <br/>
with (nod to Sandra on that one), or have them put their ears under <br/>
water to see if they can hear when you bang on the tub in different <br/>
places.<br/>
<br/>
I think we definitely need to give our kids information about <br/>
protecting other people&#39;s property, so I&#39;m not suggesting that you <br/>
*only* offer other games and never mention the problem with water on <br/>
the walls.  But depending on the child in question, you might have <br/>
better luck with the suggested alternative game if it&#39;s just a new <br/>
game, instead of &quot;something we have to do because we can&#39;t splash.&quot;  <br/>
And then, while everyone is drying off, you can mention how water <br/>
makes plaster soggy.<br/>
<br/>
If all else fails and I have to remove ds from a situation because we <br/>
just can&#39;t turn it around, things go much better if I can keep myself <br/>
out of the angry, frustrated place.  If I can be matter-of-fact and <br/>
sympathetic, the rest of the day or evening goes more smoothly.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-309115711">-=-&gt; So with my boys taking a very splashy bath. What to do there. We<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; don&#39;t have a tub, so it is a big novelty to take a big bubbly bath<br/>
 &gt; and want for them to be able to do that. I personally feel the my<br/>
 &gt; in-laws are way over the top when it come to keeping their stuff<br/>
 &gt; perfect. So I agree with my kids. But it isn&#39;t our stuff. The<br/>
 &gt; kids wouldn&#39;t stop what they were doing, no matter how I asked<br/>
 &gt; them. It seemed at the time, the only way for me to resolve this<br/>
 &gt; situation was to become the type of mom I don&#39;t want to be. -=-<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would have taken one of them out, gently, nicely, held him in a  <br/>
towel, maybe let half the water out so splashing didn&#39;t go so far,  <br/>
while telling the other one to keep the water in the tub.  Then  <br/>
switch the boys out after a while so there was only one in the tub at  <br/>
a time, but he still wasn&#39;t in the bathroom all alone.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t have a tub,  you could do what people did fifty years  <br/>
ago (what some still do):  Buy a #2 washtub, or a trough (Rubbermaid  <br/>
makes plastic ones now), and fill it up with soapy water on a porch  <br/>
or in a room without carpet, and let them have a bath there.  It  <br/>
might not work if you live in an apartment or a rental, but it&#39;s  <br/>
worth considering.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And if you get a trough, you can have a hot tub (if you own a yard  <br/>
with some outside area) with the addition of this:<br/>
<br/>

Or you could have hot bubble-baths!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-689445250">THIS IS IMPORTANT, oh ye who tried to get unschooling too fast, and  <br/>
told your kids &quot;From now on you can do whatever you want to&quot;:<br/>
<br/>
-=-But i think some people,in their journey to *get* unschooling and  <br/>
put it<br/>
into practice, think it IS ok for their child to do just about  <br/>
everything. They<br/>
believe if their child *wants* to do it, then they should go along  <br/>
with it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-There have been times in the past that I said nothing and held my  <br/>
breath and<br/>
just waited for the visit to be over but never wanted them back.-=-<br/>
<br/>
------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br/>
----------------<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a Very Bad Idea to &quot;start unschooling&quot; before you know what  <br/>
you&#39;re doing.  The more rules a family had, the more gradually and  <br/>
sensibly they need to move toward saying yes.<br/>
<br/>
The options, in an extreme and falsely dualistic way, are<br/>
<br/>
A:  to say &quot;yes&quot; hundreds of happy, surprising-to-the-kids times,  <br/>
about whether they can stay up a little later, or have another  <br/>
cookie, or visit the neighbors, or jump off the porch.  Saying &quot;YES!&quot;  <br/>
is a huge thrill to kids who have been told &quot;no&quot; thousands of times.<br/>
<br/>
B:  to say, to kids who have been told their whole lives that &quot;NO&quot;  <br/>
was good for them and was the only thing between them and hell or  <br/>
prison (or both), &quot;Oh, I&#39;ve changed my mind.  Do whatever you want!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A is months of fun, resulting in a growing mutual  trust and joy<br/>
<br/>
B is a frightening sense of &quot;mom&#39;s gone crazy or doesn&#39;t love us  <br/>
anymore,&quot; resulting in a frenzy of &quot;rule breaking&quot;--doing all the  <br/>
things that were forbidden before as if there&#39;s no tomorrow, because  <br/>
the kids figure that as far as the freedoms go, there is no tomorrow-- <br/>
the restrictions may return at any moment, so they stay awake eating  <br/>
and watching crummy TV shows for hours and HOURS because they&#39;ve  <br/>
never been able to make choices before and they&#39;re crap at it.<br/>
<br/>
Parents have come to this list and others and said some subset of  <br/>
this: &quot;Okay, I told my kids we&#39;re unschooling now so there are no  <br/>
rules.  Tell me again what unschooling is.  They&#39;re jumping around  <br/>
like monkeys and going crazy and my husband wants to leave me and my   <br/>
mom is calling the county.  I told them lots of people do it and it  <br/>
was perfectly legal.  Now what am I supposed to do?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Eeeek.<br/>
<br/>
FIRST read and understand and have a realistic grasp of the  <br/>
principles and start saying yes to your children for sensible and  <br/>
good and generous reasons you understand.   <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/yes">http://sandradodd.com/yes</a><br/>
<br/>
Keep your kids off other people&#39;s furniture both during and after  <br/>
your deschooling process.<br/>

Exactly. <br/>
And yet if a family wants to unschool asap,  before they can truly, and <br/>
fully, put it into practice 100% *accurately* (  because let&#39;s face it, it does <br/>
take *time* to change ), I feel if they can say  YES more and live with RESPECT <br/>
for all, then they are *on their way*. <br/>
 <br/>
But some people think saying YES means kids can  do anything and everything, <br/>
but if they first look at it in terms of respect,  they would be able to see <br/>
the difference.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But what about a situation where you can&#39;t move something?<br/>
&gt; Like the couch. I know it&#39;s fun to jump on couches, but the fact  <br/>
&gt; is ,I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; *want* other kids jumping on our couch when they are at our house.  <br/>
&gt; My kids<br/>
&gt; even get annoyed when they see it, but yet wouldn&#39;t say anything  <br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are people we don&#39;t invite to our house because they&#39;re not  <br/>
considerate of our stuff.<br/>
<br/>
We live in Southern California and go barefoot a lot - there are times  <br/>
we&#39;ve gone to other people&#39;s houses and my kids played outdoors and  <br/>
had dirty feet and I said, &quot;Don&#39;t walk on the carpets, they look  <br/>
really nice.&quot; Or I&#39;ve snuck them off to the bathroom and washed their  <br/>
feet. When we left someone&#39;s house &quot;I&quot; always helped to clean up and  <br/>
usually just included the kids as I did that. I&#39;d say, &quot;Well, we&#39;re  <br/>
going to need to get going in a few minutes so let&#39;s clean up a  <br/>
little. Here, Roya, help me put all the blocks in that bucket, okay?&quot;  <br/>
Sometimes the kids helped, sometimes they didn&#39;t. Either way, they got  <br/>
the idea that we at least offer to help, that became the &quot;normal&quot; way  <br/>
to behave. Same with most other behaviors - if my child climbed up on  <br/>
a coffee table at someone else&#39;s house, I&#39;d swoop her up in my arms  <br/>
and say, &quot;Oooh, not on on their coffee table - here, let&#39;s do this,  <br/>
instead....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Putting chairs on their sides, in a public place, is usually not an  <br/>
okay thing to do,  I mean, you&#39;d have to judge whether that really was  <br/>
appropriate to be doing - but, assuming for the moment that it was  <br/>
okay under the circumstances, if I saw the dad starting to turn the  <br/>
chairs back upright, I&#39;d quickly stop him, saying, &quot;That&#39;s okay, I&#39;m  <br/>
letting her do that with the chairs.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If the child still has such an extreme reaction (and, believe me, I  <br/>
have an INTENSE kid who had these kinds of reactions and I know how  <br/>
quickly it can start and how extreme it can get), I would immediately  <br/>
get the child off away from other people. I really think it is very  <br/>
very rude to let someone have a major explosion right in the midst of  <br/>
others engaged in their own activities. For the sake of the child and  <br/>
the other people - move the child to a more private spot. Just that  <br/>
often is enough to help them calm down and think about the situation.  <br/>
Being in front of other people creates added pressures and heightens  <br/>
panic and stress.<br/>
<br/>
Then, the important thing is not how the dad felt about it - I mean,  <br/>
maybe he should be apologizing, too, for putting up the chairs without  <br/>
even bothering to notice that they were being purposely put that way.<br/>
<br/>
But what is important is that the child, over time, learn better ways  <br/>
to deal with frustration, obstacles, annoyances, and so on. So, next  <br/>
time, the parent sees the child doing something that others might  <br/>
object to or might interfere with, the parent can help the child be  <br/>
prepared -- say: &quot;If you put the chairs down on their sides, some  <br/>
grown-ups or even other kids might think they&#39;re are being helpful by  <br/>
putting them back upright. You can just say that you want them like  <br/>
this.&quot; Or, &quot;Some adults might not like you doing this, so if they say  <br/>
or do anything to you about it, you can just come get me and I&#39;ll talk  <br/>
to them for you, if you want.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And, you, the parent, then have to be on the look-out for situations  <br/>
that might bring about these kinds of explosions....head them off by  <br/>
preparing the child with some options of how to respond in case.<br/>
<br/>
After a while, the child will have a sort of tool box filled with  <br/>
options and won&#39;t need you to offer the tools every time. That&#39;ll  <br/>
happen over YEARS, though.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m always surprised when people will let kids do things in public  <br/>

<br/>
Marty made a big fort out of a huge tarp.  After they camped last  <br/>
week, the tents were damp, and Keith and Marty were laying a  <br/>
different out out every day, in our library, draped over chairs and  <br/>
the couch, to get dry.  They weren&#39;t *wet,* and it&#39;s New Mexico, and  <br/>
it was just to keep them from smelly funky later.<br/>
<br/>
One is just a big striped tarp, bigger than the room.  For fun, Marty  <br/>
made a big fort out of it--set a card table under one edge as a door,  <br/>
and  had chairs (wooden chairs with leather seats) holding the tarp   <br/>
up in various places.  He and Holly invited me in.  There was room in  <br/>
there for half a dozen people.  I suggested using a  stool to make  <br/>
the center taller, so Holly got a light wood-and-raffia barstool and  <br/>
set it up on a chair in the middle.  It wasn&#39;t going to hurt the chair.<br/>
<br/>
Over the next couple of days, other friends of theirs came over and  <br/>
went in there.  It was really fun.<br/>
<br/>
Last night two of Marty&#39;s friends helped him fold it up and put it  <br/>
all away.<br/>
<br/>
Making forts with sheets is fun.  This was BIG fun.<br/>
<br/>
But still, if a visitor came and started doing things with and do my  <br/>
furniture that made me nervous, I wouldn&#39;t like it.  And I have some  <br/>
chairs that would be fine to turn on their sides, but some that  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-187831982">Sorry for not trimming but I am on my cell.  We were in a rec hall at  <br/>
an rv park and it was big and had folding tables and a slew of plastic  <br/>
patio chairs.  We were the only ones in there.  No one to bother and I  <br/>
really didn&#39;t think any harm could come from making her fort.  Still  <br/>
struggling with where to draw the line though.  Lately we have been in  <br/>
warmer climates but that means staying at rv parks with a bunch of  <br/>
seniors whom are generally very nice but some are just plain rude and  <br/>
grouchy!  Like the ones who fussed at my boys for splashing them while  <br/>
they were swimming.  Boys were just swimming and just normal splashing  <br/>
associated with it and the seniors were IN the pool!  Not sure where I  <br/>
am going with that but I guess I am just hyper sensitive lately about  <br/>
whether their behavior is appropriate or not.  But mostly how to  <br/>
properly convey to them what needs to happen.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-898565419">I have been enjoying reading this entire discussion. I cringe, because I<br/>
think there have been times when I&#39;ve been this mom.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are not wild and generally do not destroy things.  We are pretty<br/>
laid back, calm people.  However, I know there were times when I&#39;ve gone<br/>
into other people&#39;s houses and I&#39;d have no idea what the kids could and<br/>
couldn&#39;t touch. Whenever I ask, I&#39;ve had most people say &quot;oh the kids will<br/>
be fine, they can touch whatever they like&quot;.  I just don&#39;t know when it&#39;s<br/>
&quot;too far&quot;, though.  At our home children are allowed to jump on the couch<br/>
and beds.  They are allowed to climb on furniture.  My 3yo ds loves to touch<br/>
things and see how they work.  He&#39;ll walk around touching everything that<br/>
looks interesting to him and push buttons, roll, poke, examine it all.<br/>
Sometimes it&#39;s OK and sometimes it&#39;s not.  It gets confusing for me, for<br/>
instance, when my aunt has a guitar in the corner (I thought of this<br/>
story when you mentioned your guitar, Sandra) and my then 2yo goes for it.<br/>
I look at her because she is a person who has said that the kids can play<br/>
with &quot;anything&quot;.   She said it was OK, so, we sit him on the couch and he<br/>
gently strums, when he gets rough I tell him to be gentle.  Well, we didn&#39;t<br/>
see it, but, he turned the knobs on the side and now it needs tuned.   So,<br/>
now I just tell them to leave the guitar alone because my aunt got kind of<br/>
irritated about that.<br/>
<br/>
When the kids were younger (they are 3 and 6 now) this was way more of an<br/>
issue for us.  We spent a lot of time not going to certain places and<br/>
certain people&#39;s houses.  I can still remember clearly trying to console my<br/>
sensitive dd while my little ds (around 1-2) would run off touching as many<br/>
things as he could.  I had to pick and choose very carefully where we&#39;d<br/>
spent our time because it was a difficult period for me.  Still now, there<br/>
are some places we don&#39;t go very often. I took the kids to the museum the<br/>
other day after not being there for almost a year because my ds kept running<br/>
and bumping into things.  Not good in a museum..!  Our visit was much better<br/>
this time, but, we had to skip some things my dd was interested in because<br/>
ds wasn&#39;t interested and walked off.  Thankfully we have a membership (it&#39;s<br/>
a combined one with the science center, which they both love) and I can take<br/>
her alone one day.<br/>
<br/>
I am learning along with them about these things.  I grew up isolated with<br/>
just my mom who didn&#39;t speak to me very often.  We didn&#39;t visit people.  By<br/>
the time I went to school, I was extremely shy and afraid of everyone.  It<br/>
has taken me a long time just to learn the basics and I still, sometimes,<br/>
stick my foot in my mouth or do something that &quot;normal&quot; people wouldn&#39;t do.<br/>
I know obvious things (expensive, rare or delicate looking items) that my<br/>
children shouldn&#39;t play with or do, but, I have a hard time knowing the<br/>
rules of the house, since everyone&#39;s are so different.  I usually let people<br/>
know ahead of time that while my children are well behaved,  they are young,<br/>
so, let me know if there&#39;s anything you want them to stay away from.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also curious as to how people have handled these situations at<br/>
other people&#39;s houses.  I see here a lot of you frown on climbing on<br/>
furniture and touching certain things.  When my ds was young and loved to<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1622766048">I just thought of something else that probably confused me.  I remember<br/>
reading in AP books and on the lists I belonged to back then about allowing<br/>
your toddler to explore and touch things.  I can remember them talking about<br/>
letting the child touch and feel and examine to learn about things.  Of<br/>
course looking back, they probably meant with that person&#39;s permission, or<br/>
in your own home.<br/>
<br/>
I have another example.  We briefly belonged to a small playgroup that was<br/>
held at the library.  It was a conference room with tables and chairs that<br/>
we moved to the side for our group.  There were also some appliances (tv,<br/>
vcr up on this little stage area) in there.  The lady who started the group<br/>
said that the guy she spoke with about using the library space said that the<br/>
kids were free to use anything in the room and do whatever they wanted.  So,<br/>
of course, my little DS, who loves to work with his hands, liked to examine<br/>
the equipment.  He was also at an age when he loved stairs, so the stage was<br/>
awesome to him.  I stayed right by him and made sure he was gentle and<br/>
careful, not breaking anything.  A few times my dd would get upset and I&#39;d<br/>
have to console her, so, it was difficult to help him explore during those<br/>
moments.  Anyway, another woman who worked at the library came in one day<br/>
and saw the children on the stage and said that we were not allowed on the<br/>
stage.  From that point on, the class was pure hell because that&#39;s all my ds<br/>
could think about anymore once it was taken away from him.  He was somewhere<br/>
between 18months and 2yrs, so, we stopped going there.  It was no fun.<br/>
Should I have never allowed him up there to explore, do you think?  Was it<br/>
OK, since it was originally &quot;allowed&quot; and I was right there to help him?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-831143229">-=-She said it was OK, so, we sit him on the couch and he<br/>
gently strums, when he gets rough I tell him to be gentle. Well, we  <br/>
didn&#39;t<br/>
see it, but, he turned the knobs on the side and now it needs tuned. So,<br/>
now I just tell them to leave the guitar alone because my aunt got  <br/>
kind of<br/>
irritated about that.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I would set a kid up with a guitar to play on the carpet or on a bed,  <br/>
sure, and I can tune my own guitar so that wouldn&#39;t be a problem.   <br/>
It&#39;s not that I wouldn&#39;t want a child to touch my guitar, but I would  <br/>
hope his mom was not saying &quot;Sure, go all &#39;El KaBong&#39; with it, you  <br/>
little sweetie.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-When my ds was young and loved to<br/>
<br/>
climb, after a few times of basically saying &quot;they don&#39;t want you to  <br/>
touch<br/>
that/climb on there, get down&quot; (basically saying No!) or redirecting, it<br/>
would get really frustrating for a small child. So, we&#39;d just leave  <br/>
(which<br/>
I&#39;m sure relieved the other person!)-=-<br/>
<br/>
City parks are wonderful here, because kids can climb and run and  <br/>
swing and the moms can sit and talk.<br/>
<br/>
We have Explora in Albuquerque, which is all kid-touchable, too.<br/>
<br/>
Usually when littler kids are coming over here we set out a few  <br/>
things they can play with and find some good easy video games and  <br/>
movies before they show up so we can make a few offers to entertain  <br/>
them.  Some families don&#39;t think of that, though.<br/>
<br/>
We have lots of furniture kids can climb on and jump on, and we&#39;ve  <br/>
never owned a couch that wasn&#39;t used.  We let the cats sharpen their  <br/>
claws on the one downstairs, and the dog sleeps on the one upstairs.   <br/>
But when someone does have a nice couch and no pets and no kids,  <br/>
that&#39;s not for kids or cats or my dog! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1395363703">Hi--<br/>
<br/>
As for the splashy bath question I just have to chime in that we bought a small water <br/>
trough/rubber tub thing and it ended up in some of the happiest hours of my childrens&#39; <br/>
young lives, because it was outside on the deck.  There were no worries about anything--<br/>
everything just hosed down.  We would make bubble baths and just add hot water when it <br/>
needed refreshing.  My daughter would take 1 1/2 hour baths just playing with toys and <br/>
bubbles and enjoying the scenery and being outside.  She would get in and out and just loved <br/>
the freedom.  It was also great for playdates, outdoor painting, playing with flour (before the <br/>
tub), playing in the mud, etc.<br/>
<br/>
The other suggestion I have is an occasional night at an inexpensive motel--especially <br/>
during the summer if you have one with a pool.  They are usually designed for lots of <br/>
splashing, and my kids love the mystique of a new bathroom!  <br/>
<br/>
Good luck, Joanna</div>

&gt; matter my girls do not like random kids splashing them when they are<br/>
&gt; not in the game. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree that no-one should be splashed who doesn&#39;t want to be. I have said <br/>
at different times, &quot;It&#39;s only a game (or fun) if everyone is playing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sometime kids like being splashed.<br/>
<br/>
This reminded me of a time at a small hotel pool where Jayn and a stranger, <br/>
a boy very slightly older and certainly about the same size, started up a <br/>
splashing game. Jayn *loves* to be splashed, and will say so and also say if <br/>
it is too much. She was also clearly a competent swimmer by then.<br/>
<br/>
However the boy&#39;s Mom decided that he wasn&#39;t being a gentleman and started <br/>
shouting at him, from her seat nearby me, loud and with that warning tone in <br/>
her voice that I&#39;m sure we are all familiar with, to stop splashing and <br/>
added some reason that was an assumption about Jayn&#39;s enjoyment (I don&#39;t <br/>
remember the exact words, just the sense). With the intention of being <br/>
reassuring, I said to the mom something like (my best recollection) &quot;Oh my <br/>
daughter likes being splashed. She&#39;s enjoying it.&quot; The mom made some <br/>
non-committal noise, and within a minute shouted at her son again the threat <br/>
that if he splashed the &quot;little girl&quot; he would have to get out. I seem to <br/>
remember her saying something about &quot;violent play&quot; which was clearly a dig <br/>
both at her son and at Jayn.<br/>
<br/>
At this point I got up and went over to Jayn and said, and this I do <br/>
remember, &quot;This boy gets into trouble if he splashes, so will you please not <br/>
splash him.&quot; She was a bit sad I think, and they very quickly stopped <br/>
playing together at all.<br/>
<br/>
Soon Jayn got out to do some other playing, since she had some other friends <br/>
at the pool. They started playing a game in the garden instead, and had left <br/>
a pile of Barbies on the ground nearby. I saw the little boy get out of the <br/>
pool and walk to the jacuzzi. I saw him go significantly out of his way to <br/>
make sure that he walked over the dolls and dripped water over them.<br/>
<br/>
The dolls weren&#39;t actually hurt by this - it was probably only a matter of <br/>
time before they might be in the pool too - but I felt very sad for the boy. <br/>
I am guessing he felt resentful, powerless, embarrassed, misunderstood. <br/>
Luckily his mom didn&#39;t see this little act of sabotage, and I wasn&#39;t going <br/>
to tell her about it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1621879096">HI Lara and all -<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Let me try again. I find myself in situations where I think I might <br/>
be putting the wants/desires/opinions of other people before my children<br/>
And secondly when they are doing <br/>
something completely inapropriate how to handle it and get their <br/>
attention and for lack of a better word: compliance while not crossing <br/>
the line? &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Although I haven&#39;t read all the responses to your post, I went back and read the first one and have some ideas... take them or leave them.... perhaps they&#39;ve been said already...<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if this would be &#39;better&#39; but it&#39;s an alternative if you could/would go back in time... : )<br/>
<br/>
When you went to talk to your daughter when she was very upset and you told her that her behavior was inappropriate, an alternative would have been to &#39;be there for her&#39;.  Perhaps she was embarrassed about her behavior.  Perhaps her emotions were still stirred up and she was still &#39;in the story&#39; of &#39;he messed my game up on purpose&#39;.... Another idea would have been to say, &quot;I can see you&#39;re very upset right now.  You were doing something and now it has been changed.  How can I help you?&quot;  Perhaps listening... .perhaps she&#39;d preferred to be ignored so as not to draw attention to her....   If she can&#39;t apologize that day, imo, it would have been okay for her to contact him or apologize to him next time she saw him....   (I know I&#39;ve treated people poorly when in upset and just couldn&#39;t muster up the ego to admit it immediately.... )<br/>
<br/>
You asked, &quot;how do you handle when your child is rude?&quot;   In theory, I ask what&#39;s going on for my child.  <br/>
<br/>
Unrelated story.... when my son was 4-5yo, he would hit a lot... it was very frustrating and embarrassing for me... esp since he was a big kid.....  after a long time, I figured out that he hit when he was hungry... so I got to the point of, if I missed out on noticing his hunger or feeding him regularly, that when he hit, I said, &quot;let&#39;s go eat&#39;  (nobody was EVER hurt)... one day, I asked him what it was like when he hit and he told me through his tears that he hated it... that he got made at himself whenever he hit someone... that he felt sad when his friend was hurt.. .that he did not want to hit but it was &#39;an accident&#39;....<br/>
My &#39;take home message&#39; from that conversation was that I did not want to contribute to his self-criticism....  he was &#39;beating himself up&#39; already after he hit someone.... I did not want to contribute to that.... so I became more &#39;solution&#39; focused.. let&#39;s eat.... how do you want to handle this now that an &#39;oopsy&#39; has happened.... I called his outbursts &#39;oopsies&#39;..... bec. that&#39;s what it was... it was not &#39;intentional&#39; to hurt someone...  it just happens sometimes....    I know that to be true bec. I have oopsies, too... I don&#39;t mean to be mean to my kids but sometimes, I&#39;m feeling badly about something and I say something mean to them.... I apologize and say it&#39;s an oopsy... not part of my intention of how to be with them....<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps related or not, my son stopped hitting after that....  could have been a developmental thing... who knows... but being with him in that way was valuable to me.... to get away from right and wrong...  and the experience of compassion towards him felt better in me than the feelings of anger/embarrassment....<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my kids are calling from the stable to be picked up so I can&#39;t write much more now....<br/>
I also have an opinion about public spaces and who gets to decide how the chairs are used... I&#39;m big on communication and working things out.... I&#39;m not big on assuming that people would have a problem with what kids/people choose to do....  So, aside from being &#39;really annoying&#39; (to be personally defined : ), I&#39;d check in with  people about whether they are okay with the play and let them be responsible for speaking up.... I&#39;ve been places where I shushed my kids and heard back &#39;we love the playful noises&#39;..... so, watch what you assume, imo... and, imo, children can ask about jumping on furniture and be willing to hear no or an alternative....<br/>
<br/>
Off I go.... <br/>
Jane<br/>

even if all I said was &quot;No thanks.&quot;<br/>

something they do at home or with friends would be considered a  <br/>
felony if an adult did it to another adult.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1528214231">Hello Sandra -<br/>
Well, I can see that my suggestion would not have been helpful if you <br/>
were frustrated... (mental note in case I&#39;m ever in that <br/>
situation.. : )<br/>
<br/>
It is an alternative, though, that, imo, is useful....  It is not <br/>
meant as &#39;baby talk&#39;...  it is meant more as &#39;this is what I see&#39;... <br/>
not judgment.... some people want to be &#39;seen&#39; or &#39;heard&#39; <br/>
or &#39;understood&#39; so my suggestion was speaking to that possibility.  <br/>
<br/>
If a friend came to me and said, &quot;I can see that you&#39;re upset and I&#39;m <br/>
guessing it is related to xyz.  Can I help you with something?&quot;  I <br/>
would appreciate the attempt to understand, listen to, and help me.  <br/>
<br/>
So you and I are different in our responses to that type of help... :)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that earlier email was my story and I&#39;m sticking to it.. : )<br/>
<br/>
Did ANYBODY find it useful?<br/>
Anybody?  Anybody?  : )<br/>
<br/>
If not, then that&#39;s a bummer - I wasted my morning coffee computer <br/>
time on it! : )<br/>
