<div id="ygrps-yiv-131943845">I was wondering where everyone is located? Do any of you ever get <br/>
together? We are in Jacksonville. We haven&#39;t been able to find a <br/>
group to get together with that share my interest in Unschooling. So <br/>
far the reactions I have gotten have been less than encouraging. <br/>
(Except for here... thank you, thank you, thank you)<br/>

I am about 30 miles north of you, in Nassau county.<br/>
Come on over....we are home a lot.  Or we could go to<br/>
the zoo or something. Or you could come camp out to<br/>
the PARTY IN THE WOODS. May 1 - 15.  There are three<br/>
families coming, at different times. Some overlap<br/>
would make it even more fun.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to hearing from you.<br/>

I would love to get together. The zoo is a great idea. We just got a membership to go all we can stand. If you would prefer we could get together somewhere else. If you would like to email me directly at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:kinkade@...">kinkade@...</a> we can work out details.<br/>
