<div id="ygrps-yiv-2000657693">Our 8 yr old son was recently fighting a bacterial infection that left him nearly dehydrated.  As a result, we needed to give him a sip or two of liquid every twenty minutes or so for a twenty four hour period.  More than that he vomited, less than that he would be risking a hospital stay.  <br/>
<br/>
He is feeling much better today, but the one thing I have been thinking a lot about, is how easy it was (relatively speaking) to repeatedly sit him up and request that he take these sips.  He didn&#39;t fight us.  He wasn&#39;t happy about it, but it seemed like he trusted that if we were asking this from him, it must be important.  <br/>
<br/>
In the car today, coming back from his pediatrician, I asked our son if it was difficult for him to keep getting up like that for us.  He said it wasn&#39;t fun, but he figured it was necessary.  It struck me that one wonderful and important benefit of living a life of trust and respect for my child, is that when something really important is requested, my son trusts us to comply.<br/>
<br/>
This is an unexpected insight for me, and I am so happy about it.  Just wanted to share.<br/>
