I came across this looking to find out what memorial is shown in the  <br/>
corner of one of the photos I found following this e-mail from my  <br/>
husband to a medieval re-creationists list:<br/>
===================================<br/>
Nice photos of Russian Re-enactors, just in time for a &#39;Russian&#39;<br/>
Outlandish.<br/>

I was searching for statues or memorials in Pskov.  Didn&#39;t find it.   <br/>
Found this list of post cards and envelopes for sale (or formerly for  <br/>
sale).  I didn&#39;t want to buy any, but searching around it and kind of  <br/>
randomly looking at images, I learned a lot about World War II  <br/>
everyday life realities I hadn&#39;t ever heard about or considered, and  <br/>
there were things not at all related to that, either, and things from  <br/>
earlier in the 20th century.  The envelope of some confidential U.N.  <br/>
business from someone in the Congo to someone in India.  A Christmas  <br/>
card created for U.S. military personnel in Europe.  Mail from a  <br/>
German concentration camp.  Mail to a German soldier who was a  <br/>
prisoner of war in New York state.  The scans are really good, the  <br/>
stamps and post marks and addresses and the art on the envelopes and  <br/>
such are really interesting.  Jewish-specific cards to announce that  <br/>
someone&#39;s returned safely (from a battle, I was guessing--search the  <br/>
#3 list for &quot;Judaica&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
If you change the 3 to a 2 or 1 in the URL you get different lists.<br/>
