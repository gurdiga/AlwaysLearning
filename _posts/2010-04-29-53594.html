<div id="ygrps-yiv-1584552112">My first ideas are below, but I need help with this one:<br/>
<br/>
Sandra,<br/>
i wrote this to our local group to someone asking about food issues (i  <br/>
gave her your site links): &quot; I&quot;m going to write to our group about  <br/>
unschooling families who manage farms but who do not mandate chores or  <br/>
do not demand green choices from children, seperately.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I gave Alex&#39;s example. ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://polykow.blogspot.com/">http://polykow.blogspot.com/</a> ) Are there more  <br/>
out there who unschool their kids and run farms etc? A lot of people  <br/>
on my group here are interested in growing their own produce, want to  <br/>
keep junk away from their kids because they believe its hte worst  <br/>
thing they cna do to the environment etc... i&#39;ve seen several replies  <br/>
from you and others to similar questions on your groups.  BUt i&#39;m  <br/>
wondering if there are essays to this effect and also blogs of people  <br/>
who choose to eat in a certain way and farm etc... but don&#39;t mandate  <br/>
it from their children.  This may help our group.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously just reading your food page, with its principles based  <br/>
choices, has not been enough for them.  I&#39;m thinking blogs will make  <br/>
it come to life for them.  Hope i&#39;m making sense.<br/>
<br/>

======================================<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m thinking Crystal Miller, Danielle Conger...<br/>
Interesting that this came from India the day after the comment about  <br/>
Switzerland.<br/>
Is radical unschooling as it&#39;s discussed on this list compatible with  <br/>
&quot;green choices&quot;?<br/>
Is the idea of (or the term) &quot;green choice&quot; going to create an  <br/>
imbalance in people&#39;s thinking the way &quot;true Christian&quot; and &quot;non- <br/>
coercive&quot; can?<br/>
The dualistic suggestion that a family is either &quot;non-coercive&quot; by the  <br/>
definition of NCP or they are then by default &quot;coercive&quot; has caused  <br/>
frustration and confusion.  Will the idea that the opposite of &quot;green  <br/>
choice&quot; is... what is it the opposite?... cause that kind of guilt and  <br/>
scramble?<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me at first thought that forcing kids to work in gardens  <br/>
or fields isn&#39;t any way to make them love cucumbers or okra (thinking  <br/>
of two things I was pressed to work on/with as a kid, in different  <br/>
situations).<br/>

&gt; situations).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Since I was mentioned directly, I figured I&#39;d chime in...<br/>
<br/>
Living from a place of fear and guilt has rarely been conducive of <br/>
joy--personal or familial--in my experience. Yes, I&#39;m pretty well-versed <br/>
and immersed in the whole peak oil argument and have lots of thoughts on <br/>
that, which are outside the scope of unschooling discussion (but I&#39;ve <br/>
written lots about it at my farm blog: touchtheearthfarm.blogspot.com ). <br/>
That said, however, what I&#39;ve found to work best in my life is to <br/>
embrace my principles as *personal* principles and to live them in ways <br/>
that impact my kids&#39; lives in positive ways.<br/>
<br/>
My take on the matter is that if I want them to adopt my principles, and <br/>
I&#39;m not entirely sure I do, then the best way for that to happen is for <br/>
my kids to associate those principles with comfort and joy, not guilt, <br/>
fear, shame, or coercion. I can step back and realize that I got to my <br/>
current mode of thinking from a pretty conventional upbringing--if my <br/>
journey brought me here, then surely my kids can choose whatever life <br/>
path works for them and *perhaps* also get to this place of viewing the <br/>
world. Perhaps not, and that&#39;s okay with me too because one of my <br/>
personal principles is that each person gets to choose his/ her own life <br/>
path.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of ways to live one&#39;s own principles without imposing <br/>
them on others, and there are lots of ways to remain open to other <br/>
points of view. I may not choose to hunt, but I can see the value of <br/>
that for other people, my children included. I can listen <br/>
enthusiastically and do what I can to support my kids&#39; exploration of <br/>
their own values and interests without compromising what matters to <br/>
me--there&#39;s a separation there that&#39;s key, in my opinion. Being able to <br/>
view the world through their eyes and not just my own is a way to foster <br/>
connection; insisting others adopt my view is a pretty good way to <br/>
foster disconnection and conflict.<br/>
<br/>
Life is a journey, and we&#39;re constantly in the process of trying things, <br/>
stepping back to consider what&#39;s working for *all* of us and what&#39;s not, <br/>
and tweaking things to find solutions that meet *all* of our needs. My <br/>
kids love living on the farm because for them it&#39;s a source of joy, <br/>
interest, and delicious food. We&#39;re also finding that it&#39;s a source of <br/>
dissatisfaction in terms of vacationing and my husband&#39;s commute, and <br/>
those are problems we&#39;re working to address. Once the farm becomes a <br/>
drag on any one of us, it ceases to be the nurturing environment *I* <br/>
want it to be.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve done a pretty good job of creating a space where the kids can come <br/>
and go as they please, enjoy what they love about it and leave what they <br/>
don&#39;t. The trick for me has been to find ways to embrace and live my <br/>
values... to *own* them... without foisting them on those I love. That <br/>
has often created more work for me, and I&#39;ve found reminding myself that <br/>
work is something I *chose* because of the lifestyle I wanted to live... <br/>
reminding myself that in doing that work I am meeting my own needs... is <br/>
crucially important.<br/>
<br/>
Basically it boils down to the fact that I don&#39;t figure I&#39;m making this <br/>
world a better place by sowing disharmony and conflict no matter how <br/>
many confinement animals I don&#39;t eat or how much I reduce my carbon <br/>
footprint. There are lots of ways to try to make the world a better <br/>
place and I try to do that by acting within my direct sphere of <br/>
influence--my family--by keeping our focus on joy and connected <br/>
relationships: local action at its finest, in my not so humble opinion.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-872309057">&quot;Are there more<br/>

who choose to eat in a certain way and farm etc... but don&#39;t mandate<br/>
it from their children. This may help our group.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny that you mention this because I was thinking about how our family<br/>
seems to be a little bit of an anomaly because we farm and grow specialty<br/>
produce (chemical-free) for farmers markets and local restaurants.  And we<br/>
unschool.  And we (gasp) shop at Wal-Mart, drink soda, eat candy and sweets,<br/>
and we are fairly big fans of McDonald&#39;s -- which puts us at odds with a LOT<br/>
of our fellow growers.<br/>
<br/>
When it comes to our *philosophy* or our reasons for doing what we do, we<br/>
don&#39;t fit the mold, I don&#39;t think.<br/>
<br/>
Primarily, we do what we do so that we can be together as a family.  As much<br/>
as possible.<br/>
<br/>
We spend a lot of time talking about other reasons that we grow things, and<br/>
we do avoid killer pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, and we make efforts<br/>
to use *sustainable* growing practices -- but you can really get into some<br/>
good hair-splitting conversations about such things.  So much so that we<br/>
don&#39;t out and out subscribe to any one *rule* about the way we grow.  Nor do<br/>
we shun the *big, bad corporations* that are often vilified by those around<br/>
us.  We do what we do so we can be together.  And we like growing stuff.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of our fellow growers do it for political or ideological principles --<br/>
they believe whole-heartedly in certain food practices and health and<br/>
environmental ideas, and they shun those who don&#39;t toe the line.  It&#39;s VERY<br/>
taboo in the circles where we spend most of our time to be seen with a<br/>
coffee cup from McDonald&#39;s, or a bag from Wal-Mart.  I know that we get *tsk<br/>
tsk* for my husband&#39;s addiction to Coca Cola (he almost always has a can<br/>
sitting behind him when he&#39;s selling at farmer&#39;s markets).<br/>
<br/>
As for our kids&#39; involvement, we don&#39;t require them to help, although we<br/>
offer them opportunities to earn money on the farm, the same way we offer<br/>
other employees opportunities to do so.  And the same as it is in the house<br/>
-- like, hey would you mind helping me clear the table? -- it&#39;s the same on<br/>
the farm -- hey, would you guys mind helping move some of these plants into<br/>
the greenhouse with us?  It&#39;s supposed to get cold tonight. (Etc.)<br/>
<br/>
We also don&#39;t force any opinions about what&#39;s right or wrong environmentally<br/>
on anyone -- not our customers, not our friends, not our employees, not our<br/>
kids.  We don&#39;t limit sweets or sodas or *junk food.*  We also happen to<br/>
have times when we have so much spinach in the field that we&#39;re putting<br/>
spinach in every recipe we can think of.  It&#39;s kind of a game with us -- and<br/>
we laugh about it, and the kids sometimes enjoy it and eat it, and sometimes<br/>
they don&#39;t.  I think we are pretty even-keeled and we remain open to<br/>
questions about what is *good* for the earth or what is *healthy* for<br/>
humans.  My husband, who is one hell of a grower, meets every claim about<br/>
health, sustainability, and the environment with lots of skepticism, and, I<br/>
think, a scientist&#39;s mind.  I have become much more skeptical about such<br/>
claims as well.  We have had some pretty interesting conversations about<br/>
what is *right* and what is *wrong.*  There&#39;s definitely a popular mind-set<br/>
at the markets and among other growers about how things should be done.<br/>
<br/>
I guess we treat it the same as we treat anything else.  We are not<br/>
registered members of any political party; we just aren&#39;t ideologues (is<br/>
that the word?) -- we do lots of research and take a long time to make up<br/>
our minds, on almost every topic.  And our kids see us going through those<br/>
thought processes.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard not to *use* the farm as a place for learning, but we try to let<br/>
it happen naturally.  Julian, our 9-year-old, was helping pull up tomato<br/>
stakes a couple days ago with this little device we have -- it&#39;s a simple<br/>
machine, using a lever, and it makes it easy for anybody to pull up the<br/>
stakes.  Those stakes are otherwise impossible to get out of the ground.<br/>
So, we did an impromptu *lesson* on leverage and why the device makes it<br/>
possible for us to easily pull up the stakes.  He was interested.  He ended<br/>
up  looking up some stuff online about levers, and he went around trying to<br/>
find stuff that was too heavy for him to lift, and then using sticks and<br/>
shovels and whatnot, balanced on a rock or something as a fulcrum, to see if<br/>
it was easier to lift them.  I love that kind of stuff.<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I have always loved growing things -- that&#39;s what brought us<br/>
together.  He lived for awhile in I guess what you might call a more<br/>
mainstream situation, married to his first wife, working a fairly lucrative<br/>
9-5 job, after getting all the *important* higher education that was<br/>
expected of him.  He was miserable, and spent his evenings growing things.<br/>
I lived for awhile in that mainstream world, too, getting lots and lots of<br/>
education, seeking a *legitimate* living in an office, believing that one<br/>
day I&#39;d get the time and space to grow stuff in my free time.  Each of us,<br/>
my hubby and I, experienced separately something fairly significant and<br/>
shattering -- I got cancer in 2003, before I knew him.  He got dumped by his<br/>
wife, who was cheating on him, around that same time.<br/>
<br/>
I could have taken my cancer diagnosis and become a major health nut,<br/>
determining that because I had eaten so much sugar in my life, or consumed<br/>
this or that, or breathed this or that, that&#39;s why I got cancer (and I did<br/>
spend some time in that pursuit) -- but the truth is, I do not know.<br/>
Doctors do not know.  Nobody knows.  And probably won&#39;t ever.  Thankfully, I<br/>
got better after chemo and surgery and stuff.  My husband could have taken<br/>
the loss of his family life as a reason to work harder, or get religious, or<br/>
become a zealot about working out at the gym, or make some other equally<br/>
extreme decision.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, he and I both -- still not knowing each other -- decided to pursue<br/>
things that we loved.  Growing things, and family.  I sought out a partner<br/>
who was looking for the same thing.  We actually met online, and shortly<br/>
thereafter we were building compost piles together and planting beans.  Now,<br/>
four years later, we have a full-fledged business, his two kids from his<br/>
first marriage, our baby girl, another one on the way, and a fridge that has<br/>
coca cola and chemical-free bok choi in it.<br/>
<br/>
I know some of that back story may seem irrelevant, but I think it explains<br/>
a lot about why we do what we do -- it&#39;s a lot more about living life<br/>
together with your family, and not losing that precious time -- not so much<br/>
about fulfilling some ideological principle.  Which is why I will keep<br/>
drinking my McDonald&#39;s coffee (even though I do sometimes hide the cup when<br/>
I go to market).  :)<br/>

Not everyone has to think the same as you do. We automatically expect others to think and do the way we do. I think that is an instinctive survival tool. If you agree with others in a group, you are more likely to be accepted, provided for and protected. So if the family is part of some group, church, community, clan, their children will be safer if they agree with the others in the group. If they disagree, they risk being rejected and ostracized. The parents think they are protecting their children by trying to make them believe whatever their group believes because it&#39;s safe for the parents.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-323362781">Backyard Food Production and sustainability are my hobbies  not Dave&#39;s or Sorscha&#39;s.  Before we even considered moving to a place with more land, we all discussed that this was my passion.  During that conversation, Dave said that he was willing to help with odd building, lifting, guy-stuff, etc. (to support my passion) but that he wanted no part in any daily grind.   Sorscha said that she might help, but probably not. <br/>
<br/>
I have kept that initial conversation in mind whenever I make choices about this particular aspect of our lifestyle.  If I can&#39;t do it or take care of it ALONE, then I don&#39;t add it.  <br/>
<br/>
As for traveling, Dave agreed that when Sorscha and I are away that he would also need to be able to take care of everything on his own  another factor that I consider in my choices.  <br/>
<br/>
Another consideration is that Sorscha is an only child.  I know that the majority of the daily grind part needs to take place before she wakes up in the morning or once Dave is home.  I tend to do my canning and processing on the weekends so that she continues to have my full attention.  And no, she does not have any desires to piddle around in the kitchen with me - Though she does enjoy crawling like an animal around the garden and taking bites out of produce.  <br/>
<br/>
I like that both Dave & Sorscha enjoy our lifestyle and its benefits.  Because of our initial conversation regarding my passion and them setting their boundaries, we have created a great life.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1132413783">Danielle and her FB quotables! Love this: &quot;... luckily the kids are<br/>
pretty damned perfect just the way they are! Learning to see that is<br/>
the key, for sure.&quot;<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt; Being able to<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; view the world through their eyes and not just my own is a way to foster<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; connection; insisting others adopt my view is a pretty good way to<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; foster disconnection and conflict.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I&#39;m more and more thinking that not understanding this is THE biggest<br/>
&gt;&gt; roadblock to peaceful, supportive, generous, kind, responsible,<br/>
&gt;&gt; conscientious parenting. What I mean is that the mindset that parents<br/>
&gt;&gt; are SUPPOSED to raise children who believe as they do, combined with a<br/>
&gt;&gt; lack of interpersonal intelligence (ability to see through their eyes),<br/>
&gt;&gt; is what interferes with the parent-child relationship.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That combined with the idea of perfection: I think parents, especially<br/>
&gt; of young children (and I&#39;ve been there!), get caught up in the idea of<br/>
&gt; doing everything &quot;perfectly&quot; in order to churn out the &quot;perfect&quot; human<br/>
&gt; being. It&#39;s like the idea of giving the best to our kids gone awry. I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; noticed that parents of always unschooled kids don&#39;t have to deschool<br/>
&gt; quite as much as they need to de-perfection-ize. ;) Of course that&#39;s all<br/>
&gt; our own school and cultural baggage that we need to work<br/>
&gt; through--luckily the kids are pretty damned perfect just the way they<br/>
&gt; are! Learning to see that is the key, for sure.<br/>
