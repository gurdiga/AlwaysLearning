<div id="ygrps-yiv-900685280">It just occurred to me that, in addition to Bill Cosby and others <br/>
making jokes about people who like math, there are a lot of movies <br/>
which portray the mathematically gifted as insane.  One called &quot;Proof,&quot; <br/>
with Gwyneth Paltrow and Anthony Hopkins was just on; I&#39;m not sure what <br/>
was going on, but I think he was a math genius father who killed <br/>
himself, and she the math genius daughter who blamed herself.  Others I <br/>
can think of are &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; (which I never saw, so I don&#39;t <br/>
know if the math geniuses are portrayed as crazy), &quot;A Beautiful Mind,&quot; <br/>
and &quot;Pi,&quot; which I actually own.<br/>

Not.<br/>
<br/>
The psychologist played by Robin Williams is shown as a little crazy,  <br/>
but for good reason.<br/>
<br/>
They use &quot;the F word&quot; more than any other movie I know of except for  <br/>
Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (just for the record...)<br/>
