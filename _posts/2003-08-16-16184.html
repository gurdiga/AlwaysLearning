<div id="ygrps-yiv-1835608602">I was wondering how some of you set up portfolios for your kids.  <br/>
this is my 1st year of home schooling my almost nine year old.  She <br/>
is bright and will read almost anything I give her.  We&#39;re just <br/>
starting to get organized and I&#39;d like some input as to what you&#39;d <br/>
suggest as a place to start.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1485399055">Hi my name is Jay and I have a feeling that I have been on this group <br/>
before but would like to introduce my self.  We that is Martin and <br/>
the boys Axel 8 and Craig 6 are lving in Brittany at the moment but <br/>
are moving possible back to uk.  We found the system here no good for <br/>
our unschooling children.  We have a dream<br/>
 <br/>
OUR DREAM.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We are living in a village that has a large building with a social <br/>
centre including a shop, an alternative healing centre and café.  <br/>
There are therapy rooms, a dance/theatre workshop, and a library.  Up <br/>
stairs is a large room, which has lectures, demonstrations and indoor <br/>
fairs.  At times this room is section off for small gatherings. There <br/>
are community cars.  Part of the land is used for growing food; there <br/>
is reed bed water filtration, a communal garden and managed <br/>
woodland.  All aspects of the land management are organic. The <br/>
majority of children are home educated and part of the Social centre <br/>
is used as a learning centre for both adults and children.  Learning <br/>
is considered an ongoing process and anything from learning to read <br/>
to astrophysics is being studied at any one time.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Courses are held by people who have a passion for their subject and <br/>
want to share it with others.  These courses are open to anyone; some <br/>
get the courses for free.  The subjects range from land management to <br/>
cooking on a budge, from sculpture to decorating & alternative <br/>
therapies.  These courses are advertise internationally and a deal is <br/>
set up with local people to have course participants staying with <br/>
them for a fee.  There is a respite facility for families or <br/>
individuals to come and stay and try some of the courses and sample <br/>
some alternative therapies.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Martin has a thriving massage practice using his hands on healing. I <br/>
am spending time with my children in a childfrendly environment and I <br/>
run workshops on NVC,TCS,.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone in the village works either from home or in the centre <br/>
unless they have chosen to work outside.  No Mother works until she <br/>
is ready too and the community supports one parent families.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is what we are working towards<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Love from Jay Mother to Axel and Craig and partner to Martin<br/>
<br/>
We all know how children feel because we feel the same way.  However when  we do not respect children&#39;s feelings it is because ours  were not respected when we were children.<br/>

&lt;&lt; This is what we are working towards &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How&#39;s the unschooling going?<br/>
There are other lists for discussing communes and intentional communities.  <br/>
It&#39;s fascinating but rarely workable.  Unschooling can work, though!  Let&#39;s <br/>
talk about that, please.<br/>

You may pass it on freely.  It is not currently an intentional  community, <br/>
more like an artist&#39;s colony with very few artists left.  But it  has great <br/>
potential and I would hate to see it go to someone who didn&#39;t  appreciate it.<br/>
