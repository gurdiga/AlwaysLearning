<div id="ygrps-yiv-144427371">Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I wanted to share one of the bizarre effects unshooling has had on me.<br/>
Before I started unschooling with my children, I had never written a poem of<br/>
any sort.  Ok, maybe they forced me in school to eek out a haiku or two, but<br/>
that was the entire extent of it.  So..you can understand my amazement when<br/>
I came up with the following poems on the fly.  I have no clue if they<br/>
follow any real poetic structure so I apologize if they grate on anybody&#39;s<br/>
poetic sensitivities. :-)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Poem 1 was written when we named our cat.   Probably a rip off from T.S.<br/>
Elliot, but hey, ya&#39; got to start somewheres.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Jenny B. Jangles the Abby cat wakes up slowly.<br/>
<br/>
She stretches - yawns<br/>
<br/>
Then lies back down.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Jenny B. Jangles the Abby cat plays her games.<br/>
<br/>
She dances, she prances,<br/>
<br/>
She wiggles, she pounces.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Jenny B. the day is done,<br/>
<br/>
But your night has just begun.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Poem 2 was written while driving the car when my son took off his shoes.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Stinking socks standing stiffly,<br/>
<br/>
Sadly seeking suds.<br/>
<br/>
.<br/>
<br/>
Smiling socks slowly slipping<br/>
<br/>
Into soap sublime.<br/>
<br/>

Holly has an irritating habit I think she only does with me, and it&#39;s  coming <br/>
to a head.  I&#39;m not figuring out how to get her to stop.  If I  tell her <br/>
something I think is interesting or important to her future (like that  rayon is <br/>
from wood fibers or something, just some three second trivia thing) whe  will <br/>
tell me when the last time I told her that, or just &quot;You&#39;ve said that  before.&quot; <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Yesterday we were in Target, and I said something cloth related (can&#39;t  <br/>
remember, but that&#39;s what made me think of rayon, which it wasn&#39;t, yesterday)  and <br/>
she said &quot;You&#39;ve told me that before.&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
Sometimes I&#39;ll say better to say it twice than never, or &quot;sorry&quot; or &quot;I bet  <br/>
I&#39;ll say it again someday, too,&quot; or &quot;WHY DO YOU DO THAT?&quot; or sometimes I just  <br/>
let it go by.  But yesterday I said, &quot;Yeah?  Well I&#39;m going to tell  you two <br/>
more times and then I&#39;m going to die.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
It was just a wild new humorous response, but she got big eyes and said  <br/>
&quot;Then don&#39;t tell me anymore.&quot;  And I said, &quot;But what if I had never told  you?&quot;  <br/>
And we let it drop.  <br/>
 <br/>
But she has a habit of reciting the past in review as if we need to  know.  <br/>
She&#39;ll say &quot;The last time we went to the zoo you brought a water  bottle too,&quot; <br/>
or &quot;When we rented that movie last time, we ate  spaghetti.&quot;   Thank you <br/>
Holly, for that trivia review!  So it can  be fun or neutral, or it can seem <br/>
personal and critical.  <br/>
 <br/>
Often, with me, when it&#39;s Holly, it&#39;s personal.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She has a brain that keeps that kind of trivia - such detail - such <br/>
connections - and so, really, she&#39;s just sharing with you something <br/>
that SHE is amazingly good at and most people are not (and she&#39;s <br/>
NOTICED that).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d just keep doing what you&#39;re doing - without the &quot;death threat&quot; - by <br/>
saying, &quot;Yeah, I probably say it again, too,&quot; in the same sort of <br/>
neutral way that she gave the info to you in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
She might think it is interesting to you to know how forgetful you are <br/>
compared to herself. After all, everything else she&#39;s ever done in the <br/>
world has been pretty darn fascinating to you, right? Why would she not <br/>
think this is interest to you, too? And - remember - she doesn&#39;t have <br/>
the sense we have of growing older and more forgetful and our concerns <br/>
about repeating ourselves and being boring old coots.<br/>
<br/>
My dad was sick and had to swallow a LOT of pills. He was in the <br/>
hospital and the nurse was giving him one pill after another. I said, <br/>
&quot;Did you know I could swallow all of those at one time? I&#39;m amazingly <br/>
good at swallowing large numbers of pills at once.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The NURSE jumped all over me. &quot;He&#39;s doing just fine,&quot; etc.<br/>
<br/>
HEY - I wasn&#39;t dissin&#39; my dad --- I just thought it was something he&#39;d <br/>
be interested in, that I had that specific talent that he probably <br/>
didn&#39;t even know about me.<br/>
<br/>
But the nurse thought it would make him feel old or something - make <br/>
him feel worse. She was probably right - I was young and didn&#39;t have <br/>
any sense of fear of old age or death and so I didn&#39;t have enough <br/>
empathy to know that this was probably NOT something he needed to know <br/>
about me right at that time.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking Holly is the same way - it never occurs to her that you <br/>
actually feel dissed by her comment that you&#39;ve told her something <br/>
before - it is just information - just a tiny bit interesting - from <br/>
her point of view?<br/>
<br/>
Of course, she might be just a little irritated by you repeating <br/>
yourself - it means you&#39;re human and sometimes kids (especially her <br/>
age) don&#39;t really feel comfortable being reminded that their parents <br/>
are subject to the problems of aging. Scary. So maybe there is that to <br/>
it, too, and she&#39;s hoping that if she just points out that you&#39;re <br/>
repeating yourself, you&#39;ll stop it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What a quick and humorous response Sandra. It takes control to not give a<br/>
knee-jerk reaction (I&#39;m still  working on this one). Maybe it is part of the<br/>
female nature to have this sort of relationship with mother? I don&#39;t know, I<br/>
just know that I have a very similar kind of communication with my daughter.<br/>

My 13 yo daughter seems to roll her eyes at just about everything I say.<br/>
I&#39;ve learned to keep it short and light, but sometimes I just want to<br/>

YOU TO LISTEN!!!&quot; but I don&#39;t, at least not in that moment. Breathing deep<br/>

these things&quot; or &quot;did I say that again??? I must really like that one&quot; seems<br/>

<br/>
My relationship with my teenage boys is much different. They don&#39;t seem to<br/>
react negatively to anything I say. Lol, they&#39;re probably quietly ignoring<br/>
me.<br/>

Yet another difference between the sexes?<br/>

------------------<br/>
 <br/>
Could be that.  She gets along better with her dad than she does with  me, in <br/>
a way, or maybe I just get more frustrated with her than I do with the  boys. <br/>
 We hang out together a lot, too--more than I did with either of the  boys at <br/>
that age (probably because I was spending so much time with Holly), so  it <br/>
might be partly that she&#39;s the youngest.  And female.  And Holly.  &lt;g&gt;  She&#39;s <br/>
fun, andI like her, and so I should just expect that wsome  percenae of our <br/>
hanging-out will be while one or both of us is tired or  hungry.<br/>

I haven&#39;t posted here for ages but I just wanted to say thenks Jacky <br/>

say.<br/>

<br/>
My question:<br/>
I wonder how long this will go on? Does being a 13yo girl make you <br/>
lethargic and uncommunicative and how have others got through this? <br/>
I have recollections of sharing most of my teenage life with my <br/>
mother and don&#39;t quite get my 13yo at present.<br/>

I wonder  how long this will go on? Does being a 13yo girl make you <br/>
lethargic and  uncommunicative and how have others got through this? <br/>
I have recollections  of sharing most of my teenage life with my <br/>
mother and don&#39;t quite get my  13yo at present.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
===========<br/>
 <br/>
I knew from conversations with my husband, Keith, that he had a later  <br/>
puberty than I did (and a little later than some boys).  Of our kids, Kirby  and <br/>
Holly are more like my family and Marty is a LOT like his dad in tons of  ways.   <br/>
Kirby&#39;s puberty was harsh, added to we had moved recently and  he doesn&#39;t <br/>
like change, and he&#39;s the oldest and resented the fun attention the  younger ones <br/>
were getting while he was having his metamorphosis into bigger,  hairier, <br/>
unfamiliar big-guy.   He was hard for anyone to deal with for  a while.  <br/>
 <br/>
Holly&#39;s a little volatile sometimes, and short tempered.  She&#39;s  13.<br/>
 <br/>
Marty, at 16, though he has beard hair and height and shoulders and all  <br/>
that, has just lately gotten the snappish impatience the others got sooner, and  I <br/>
figure it&#39;s because Keith had &quot;it&quot; late (whatever all the hormonal &quot;it&quot;  is).<br/>
 <br/>
I think it&#39;s a natural instinctive separation from parents, and parents do  <br/>
best to give those kids more respect and more choices and more freedom if they  <br/>
can manage to do so.  Acknowledge that they&#39;re old enough to reproduce,  <br/>
maybe, that in some cultures of the past they would have been marriageable, that  <br/>
you&#39;re glad our culture waits until people are older to launch them out into  <br/>
parenthood and responsibility for a house or job, and you&#39;re glad they&#39;re <br/>
still  around.  (If any of that&#39;s no good for your family, fine; at least remember <br/>
 it in your own mind, though.)<br/>
 <br/>
When my then-best-friend was moving to California a dozen years ago, we  <br/>
found ourselves really short-tempered and mean with each other.  Little  things he <br/>
did seemed hugely personal to me, and vice versa, but we&#39;ve had a  policy <br/>
always to talk about things like that and not guess.  We didn&#39;t  know, though, <br/>
why we were so grouchy.   <br/>
 <br/>
Turns out it&#39;s something that happens with lots of people in such  <br/>
situations.  When friends are going to be separated it causes some anxiety  and like <br/>
scared dogs biting a person who&#39;s trying to help them, they lash out at  the <br/>
nearest person, not knowing what&#39;s causing their pain.  If they&#39;re mad  at each <br/>
other, the parting is easier.  One is more glad to go and the other  says &quot;fine, <br/>
good riddance.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
I think something like that happens with parents and children, too.   And it <br/>
happens when the instincts get the first whif (probably physically, at  some <br/>
level) of the offspring&#39;s impending adulthood, and happens some more when  they <br/>
first start to care more about what someone outside the family things  <br/>
(mating business) and then when they leave.   But if we can see it as  natural <br/>
separation behaviors, it won&#39;t hurt our feelings so much.  <br/>
 <br/>
I waited until I was in my 30&#39;s to have kids, but more people my age (and  <br/>
lots of my friends were already &quot;doing it.&quot;  I&#39;ve held the hand of many  people <br/>
I knew since we were teens who weren&#39;t handling their own teens&#39; reations  <br/>
well (nor reacting well to them) and I&#39;m sure that&#39;s also helped me be calmer  <br/>
with my own.  I&#39;ve seen the kind of clinging and controlling and insulting  NOT <br/>
to do.  Ifail sometimes, but I move away from the &quot;oops&quot; spot and try  to give <br/>
the kids more peaceful space for their transformation to occur.<br/>
 <br/>
Holly, especially, did NOT want to grow older.  She LIKED being  young.  She <br/>
asked me and Keith yesterday why we didn&#39;t treat her like she  was five <br/>
anymore.  It was a wistful kind of question.<br/>
 <br/>
I think it lasts about a year, with occasional relapses, and is worse if  the <br/>
parent resists it.<br/>

important thing. What is important, what can help the adolescent most (and by <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1874128904">Thanks Deborah. I have to think about this one. If the idea of getting a job<br/>
doesn&#39;t come from my teenagers, are you suggesting that we give them the<br/>
idea? I&#39;m not sure I would even suggest it to them. My assumption is that as<br/>
they want to do more things that cost money, they will want to make money.<br/>
Or if there is a place where they are inclined to work because of their<br/>
skills or desires, they will pursue that. I would certainly help them with<br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
The other thought I have is that maybe not every teenager is ready for that<br/>
responsibility. My 16 yo son, who is autistic/Asperger&#39;s, and has had 3<br/>
open-heart surgeries (the last one happened last year and didn&#39;t go well,<br/>
some long-term neurological effects) is ready for some responsibility this<br/>
way, but I am definitely letting him call the shots. He recently said that<br/>
he wanted to work at the local multiplex theatre (film-making is his<br/>
passion) and I took him there, he filled out the application in his unique<br/>
way, and I even called the administration office to let them know a little<br/>
about his history. They were very enthusiastic about his application. I<br/>
don&#39;t know if he can really fulfill the responsibilities, but we&#39;ll find<br/>
out!<br/>
<br/>
I do understand and believe that teenagers who feel needed and responsible<br/>
have a feeling of connectedness to their importance in the world. We have<br/>
found ways to do that at home (art, music-making, home care, whatever their<br/>
interests) and in the neighborhood (babysitting, animal care) and I can see<br/>
how these activities have made them feel important during this  time. Maybe<br/>
this is the feeling you are referring to that you&#39;ve seen with your<br/>
teenagers have started working out of the home.<br/>
<br/>
The description &quot;a job with real responsibility. Someplace<br/>
they&#39;re valued for something they can do, that not everyone can do. A place<br/>
they<br/>
can build mutually dependent relationships with adults outside their<br/>
family -<br/>
where someone is counting on them to be there and do a good job. A job where<br/>
they&#39;re just one more warm body out of many probably isn&#39;t going to be as<br/>
valuable.&quot; sounds ideal! I hope we all find that!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the thought-provoking!<br/>
<br/>
