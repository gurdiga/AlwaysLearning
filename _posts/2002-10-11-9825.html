<div id="ygrps-yiv-294522141">When I attending music school -- one of the biggest thrills was to go the the listening library and check out/watch  the Bugs Bunny Barber of Seville video tape. The opera majors especially!<br/>
<br/>
There is a childrens orchestra production of &quot;Bugs Bunny on Broadway&quot; -- the Philadelphia Orchestra did it this past summer. From what I understand, it travels to different cities with the same conductor. They show Bugs Bunny cartoons on 2 or more screens while the orchestra plays the music live! Fantastic Music Education!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-428040457">I thought I&#39;d share a new favorite musician.<br/>
<br/>
His name&#39;s Danny Schmidt. He&#39;s from Austin, TX. We drove up to <br/>
Charlotte, NC last week to hear/see him.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s a singer-songwriter, and his lyrics and music are hauntingly <br/>
beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
As a warning: I&#39;m not a fan of much new music. I joke that there hasn&#39;t <br/>
been any good music since 1978! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But I bet you all will be just taken with Danny as I have!<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s his website: www.dannyschmidt.com  You can download music and <br/>
video there, listen to a few tracks, and buy CDs.<br/>
<br/>
He also gives house concerts. We&#39;re working with him now to arrange <br/>
something here in Columbia later this summer.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s going to be out on the west coast next month. Zenmomma? Maybe at <br/>
your coffee house? &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
