<div id="ygrps-yiv-770565906">OK, my 8 (almost 9) yo son was playing with some neighborhood kids<br/>
yesterday and they were playing with these airsoft guns (kinda like a<br/>
paintball game just with plastic bb&#39;s).  So, my son wants one.  I want<br/>
to say yes, but part of me is wondering if that is really just not<br/>
very smart on my part???<br/>
<br/>
I should say that I don&#39;t really care for these kids in the<br/>
neighborhood and they aren&#39;t my sons first choice to play with, but<br/>
since it&#39;s warmed up they&#39;ve been coming over more often.<br/>
<br/>
My concerns.<br/>
<br/>
What would the neighbors think of me for letting my son play with<br/>
these  ??  I know...who cares!  I can get over this one!!<br/>
<br/>
Is he old enough??  These boys are a few years older...but I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
say they&#39;re more mature.  In fact yesterday one of them had an extra<br/>
gun for him to play with and he said he wanted to watch first and<br/>
check it out with mom and dad?  (WOW, when I was a kid I sure wouldn&#39;t<br/>
have done that!!  What&#39;s that saying, easier to ask for forgiveness<br/>
than permission?? &lt;bwg&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
So, last night I told him I&#39;d do some research (which I&#39;m in the<br/>
process of and these are outlawed in some countries)! I also read that<br/>
you have to be 18 to purchase these.  One website selling these, says<br/>
this is NOT a toy.  Most articles I&#39;m reading are saying these guns<br/>
are not for children unless supervised by an adult.  Which I could do.<br/>
 I also told him I&#39;d like to walk down to the park and see how it&#39;s<br/>
played, check it out, see how safe I feel it is.<br/>
<br/>
I know all about the safety gear (eyewear,etc.) and knowing him he&#39;d<br/>
be really responsible about listening to the warnings and taking the<br/>
safety precautions!  One of my concerns is these kids that he&#39;s<br/>
playing with and that they won&#39;t be very careful. <br/>
<br/>
DS has always enjoyed weapons, light sabers, swords, toy guns, all<br/>
that kind of imaginative play! Which to be honest, before I had kids<br/>
(my son), I would have said I&#39;d never bring a weapon into my house<br/>
(real or fake)!  So, I&#39;ve done a 180, but I still don&#39;t own any real<br/>
guns! :)  <br/>
<br/>
So, I guess I&#39;m asking here wondering if anyone has experience with<br/>
these airsoft guns.  And I guess I&#39;m wondering if this yes should wait?? <br/>

<br/>
About airsoft guns:  I could&#39;ve written your letter.  It sounds exactly where I was at a few years ago, though my son was probably 10.  The kids from the hood with the guns were the kids he played with.  I told them to please not bring the guns to the house if they wanted to play at our home.  I had a 6 and 2 year old at the time.  The kids listened and respected that.  These same kids always walked the line between being great and practically breaking the law, so I had to keep a close eye on my son, who is only 1 year younger.  At 11, I gave in.  I say &quot;gave in&quot; because that is how I felt about it at the time.  I didn&#39;t want to argue about it EVERY day.  Yes, I was and still am very concerned about the safety....but he protected himself and I told all the kids *my* expectation that they ALL protect themselves at all times, that I was concerned and loved them all.  <br/>
<br/>
They played a lot for a few weeks.  Then once a week, then once a month.  You get it.  But my son was so thrilled to be more of a part of his &quot;tribe&quot; and not so far on the outskirts.  Which I think he has always felt being homeschooled and our home being the LAST to own any video game system etc.  <br/>
<br/>
His trust in me went up and mine in him as well.  It did lead to paint ball------------but again, 3x a year maybe??  It really was more about the mutual trust, and ME hearing what HIS wants were.  <br/>
<br/>
I hate guns.  I have never wanted anything to do with them.  I have 3 boys.  They love swords, knives, guns....you name it.  But they also fully believe in fairies, knomes, elves and goodness everlasting.  So that is the balance of the scales for them I guess.  I try to think about the hardwiring that is in each of us.  I tend to rely on this a lot to help me understand the needs of my boys.  Men/boys were the protectors for thousands of years.  They could not be afraid to be attacked or to attack.  They were busy hunting and focusing on that ONE goal----feeding the family or group.  (this might explain part of why we perceive men as only being able to accomplish one thing at a time).  <br/>
<br/>
My boys&#39; drive toward guns was not brought on by MTV (never seen it) nor movies or real life dramas.  They made &quot;guns&quot; from sticks as early as they could walk.  So, I don&#39;t think it is about the violence for them.  Though *I* feel guns are violent by nature.......the boys do not.  We have talked for hours about his issue, and it helped my oldest be a bit more patient with me during the time he was hearing NO.  But I told him that I would really find a way to make his DESIRE be realized.  And I did.  I had to expand MY comfort zone.  Just as I ask him to expand his comfort zone by reading an article or joining me for a play.  We all need to stretch.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, of course--go look, observe, and continue to talk and observe your son&#39;s play with these guns.  My little guys-now 9 and 5 play with them.......EMPTY.  That does not decrease the fun for them.  Besides, the &quot;bullets&quot; cost money and usually my oldest has other things he would rather do for the same cost.  Now it is on to ATV&#39;s and jet skies.........so stretch NOW!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Our family does have experience with these guns, and they are a lot of<br/>
fun to play with. I&#39;ve had children using them responsibly at 8,<br/>
although it was illegal to sell them to those under 14 where we lived. <br/>
But we used to live in the middle of nowhere. Now we live in an area<br/>
where playing with guns like these would be a dangerous choice to make.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Amy, we have been big into airsoft for years and have actually invested quite a bit of <br/>
money into the sport over the years.  My youngest son is now 15 but like I said we&#39;ve <br/>
played for years.  I can&#39;t remember how old he was when he started playing.  the &quot;rule&quot; is <br/>
that everyone MUST wear protective gear at all times.  If someone in the group refuses <br/>
then my son is instructed not to play.  All of us parents in the neighborhood are pretty <br/>
much on the same page so wherever they&#39;re playing we keep a watchful eye without <br/>
hovering.  The kids &quot;get&quot; the importance of safety so it really isn&#39;t much of an issue.  My <br/>
boys love it when I play with them which is rare.  They think it&#39;s pretty funny with all of my <br/>
girly screaming and carrying ons.  <br/>
<br/>
My boys have always had an interest in weapons - not because of negative influences but <br/>
because it&#39;s their bent.  I think it&#39;s normal for boys to have a healthy interest in weapons.  <br/>
Having said that my own personal rule of thumb has always been that if I see anything <br/>
strange going on as with any other interest, I explore it and if need be pull in the reins.  I <br/>
can only think of a couple times when I&#39;ve had to do that  and airsoft has not been one of <br/>
them.<br/>
