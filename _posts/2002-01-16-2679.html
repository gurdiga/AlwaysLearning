 </span></blockquote>Yeah. I think that&#39;s true. But it doesn&#39;t mean that kids come out of either <br/>
one - bad marriage or divorce - without resulting issues.<br/>
<br/>
I have to agree with Sandra here, too, that so many parents could probably <br/>
try harder for the kids sakes.  I&#39;m not talking about &quot;staying together for <br/>
the kids&quot; and just living in a bad marriage. I&#39;m talking about not giving up <br/>
on a marriage without a much bigger effort and more support and learning of <br/>
skills to make it work. In our culture there is so much support for divorce. <br/>
Everyone talks about having the right to a &quot;good relationship&quot; and so on. But <br/>
so often the kids are left out of that equation. So many people go off and <br/>
have affairs and that ends their marriage. They justify it because they <br/>
weren&#39;t &quot;getting their needs met&quot; in the marriage. I&#39;m sure it is true. But <br/>
it is so selfish and so thoughtless of the kids. <br/>

I agree! I think a couple should make every effort to<br/>
&#39;save&#39; their relationship before throwing in the<br/>
proverbial towel (in most cases - obviously I would<br/>
think differently if someone was in danger).<br/>
<br/>

needs (to my satisfaction), so I will meet someone<br/>
else&#39;s&quot; &quot;So they &#39;go off and have affairs and that<br/>
ends the marriage&quot;.....(eventually).....This internal<br/>
(masculine) dialogue often begins during pregnancy....<br/>

&quot;easier&quot; How is it any less selfish than just saying &quot;i&#39;m leaving&quot;?<br/>

<br/>
Not all couples break up over the first infidelity.  So having an affair <br/>
isn&#39;t the same as leaving, necessarily (and maybe I misunderstood the <br/>
statement; likely I did).<br/>
<br/>
But leaving does often need to be made easier.  When I was deciding whether <br/>
to leave my first husband (we had married for a purpose, not for love--for <br/>
him to keep his brother and sister rather than have them shipped off to their <br/>
late mother&#39;s childless twin sister five states away), it helped to catalog <br/>
all the bad things and disregard the good things.  Sometimes I wish I had <br/>
never left, but then my sister and other friends remind me of bad things I <br/>
hadn&#39;t even known about at the time.  <br/>
<br/>
We didnt&#39; have kids, but it was disruptive for the two who were there, who <br/>
were 16 and 14 at the time.  Not as disruptive as the deaths of their <br/>
parents, I told myself as justification.  And the 14 yr old, the boy, had <br/>
never liked me anyway and I wasn&#39;t doing him much good in my very-young and <br/>
inexperienced state.  That&#39;s another thing I&#39;d love to be able to go back and <br/>
do with my current level of awareness.<br/>

No, it was a bad end with that.  He got really mean to other people too, so I <br/>
ended up somewhat justified.  And I discovered just within the past few years <br/>
that he had been sexually abusing my little brother who was six years younger <br/>
or so.  Horrible too-late-breaking news...<br/>
<br/>
But I am in touch with Ruthie, his older sister!   And she has a daughter <br/>
about Holly&#39;s age named Naomi.  They got to see each other in November.<br/>
