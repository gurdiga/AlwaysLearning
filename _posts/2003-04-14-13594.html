<div id="ygrps-yiv-2006017979">Hi everyone!                I know this has been probably hashed out a million times but I really need some wise words on how to deal with grandparents who feel my children are &#39;missing out&#39; on opportunities.                                           This last week we, me and my 3 kids, were  visiting grandparents.     There were several things that came up that they wanted my kids to go to, but my kids chose other things.          Their cousins also live in the same town, so they wanted to play with them the majority of their time.   Which I can understand.                    But.....grandpa and grandma think we should just say to our kids,  &quot;we are going to this concert,   we are going to this function,   your are going to eat this meal....and so on&quot;.                            They believe our kids will thank us in the long run, for the great opportunites.       We said it was up to the kids.               Grandparents didn&#39;t say much to that.                             Now, days later,  I hear that they are disgusted with us.     Grandma&#39;s feelings are hurt.          What can I say to this?         And should I be making my kids do some things that I think they would enjoy.      Everyone else in my family, siblings and such, thinks yes,  that the kids don&#39;t know.               I really feel like our lives are so much more at peace and things are going so well since we&#39;ve been living this unschooling life.        And I feel in my heart that I&#39;m doing the right thing.    But, I still need some more ideas in responding to this type of criticism.       What do you guys think?       Sorry about the formatting,   something is wrong with my yahoo e-mail.     Thanks,          Kelli                       <br/>

spur of the moment idea and a special trip to do something with someone you <br/>
don&#39;t see regularly.  If tickets are purchased ahead of time, I think kids <br/>
should be coerced to comply, if they seem indifferent.  If they&#39;re strongly <br/>
opposed and would be no matter what, then someone else should be offered the <br/>
tickets, I guess.  I also think that if tickets weren&#39;t purchased in advance, <br/>
then I would probably have gone, after making arrangements for the ones who <br/>
didn&#39;t want to go, just to grease the wheel of the relationship.<br/>
<br/>
It would have been nice if G&G had spoken to the kids in advance and given <br/>
them some options.<br/>

<br/>
I think there&#39;s a difference.<br/>
<br/>
Are her feelings hurt?  That is a wound turned inward.<br/>
<br/>
Is she digusted?  That&#39;s more fury turned outward and left to lie there and <br/>
fester.<br/>
<br/>
Her feelings shouldn&#39;t be a part of it, though, so to lure you closer with <br/>
even third hand rumor of &quot;feelings hurt sounds like a trap to me.<br/>

I think you should just play &quot;la la la&quot; like you don&#39;t know anything&#39;s wrong <br/>
and see if they feel different before the next encounter.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1331738178">This concert that the kids didn&#39;t want to go to was a free concert and Grandma had already been turned down by another grandson. I think that might have been something to do with how she was feeling about the whole weekend.          In turn she probably thought my kids would just go along with her.     Playing with their cousins was more of a pull.        They don&#39;t get to see them very much. My kids have started to say that they don&#39;t want to stay at this Grandparents house.    And I asked why....my dd (8) said because Grandpa wouldn&#39;t  let her talk to me on the phone one time when they were talking care of them.      He didn&#39;t think she needed to talk to me.    Thought it would cause problems,  make her sad.         Well,  not letting her talk to me made the sadness,  and us leaving her there.        It won&#39;t be happening again.        They are in the mind set that &quot;everything is just fine!  You&#39;re OK,  stop that crying.&quot;     &lt;Big Sigh&gt;         I will also,  probably make our stays alot shorter from now on.         I guess I&#39;m beginning to figure out why some of my dh&#39;s siblings don&#39;t want to get together with G & G.                   Kelli    <br/>

<br/>
This is so terribly sad to me. My kids are forever begging to see their <br/>
grandparents and we live near them about a half an hour away, which in <br/>
southern California, that&#39;s pretty close. My Grandma&#39;s treasure the time they <br/>
see their Great-grandaughters because that alone is something to be <br/>
treasured. To have four living generations is quite awesome. Until just a few <br/>
years ago my great grandma was alive so there were five generations. I always <br/>
bring that up when all the grandmas are around. There will come a day that <br/>
this is not so, so I gently remind them how lucky we all are to even be <br/>
together.<br/>
<br/>
The funny thing is though, my paternal grandmother always has a fit that my <br/>
kids don&#39;t get summer vacation like all those schooled kids do. My aunts go <br/>
round and round with her, trying to explain about how they don&#39;t go to <br/>
school, so it&#39;s a non-issue, but she insists that it&#39;s just not fair to my <br/>
kids to have to learn all the time. The way I see it, she actually gets it. <br/>
Everyone walks around rolling their eyes, and I just wink at her. She tells <br/>
everyone within earshot, that I don&#39;t send my kids to school because they <br/>
mean too much. Older people are often like small children, they say what they <br/>
mean and they mean what they say. She&#39;s not of feeble mind at all, she just <br/>
figures everyone should do it because I do. As the first born grandchild, I <br/>
gave birth to the first born great-grandchildren, and 2 at a time just like <br/>
grandma. The cousins who have started families are already dreading what they <br/>
are going to do about school because I raged against the machine and <br/>
grandma&#39;s on my side. One cousing said thanx a lot, now we&#39;ll have to <br/>
homeschool or grandma will say we don&#39;t love our kids as much as you do. LOL<br/>
<br/>
Wow did I fall off topic or what?<br/>
<br/>
Peace to you and yours,<br/>
Rhonda<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Our twins are the first born only grandchildren on both sides, and so <br/>
far none coming up, so who knows what they will have accomplished by the time <br/>
someone else has kids.<br/>
<br/>
P.S.S. Kelli, you can borrow either of my grandmas, whenever you need to.<br/>

southern California, that&#39;s pretty close. My Grandma&#39;s treasure the time they <br/>
see their Great-grandaughters because that alone is something to be <br/>
treasured. To have four living generations is quite awesome. Until just a few <br/>
years ago my great grandma was alive so there were five generations. I always <br/>
bring that up when all the grandmas are around. There will come a day that <br/>
this is not so, so I gently remind them how lucky we all are to even be <br/>
together.<br/>
<br/>
The funny thing is though, my paternal grandmother always has a fit that my <br/>
kids don&#39;t get summer vacation like all those schooled kids do. My aunts go <br/>
round and round with her, trying to explain about how they don&#39;t go to <br/>
school, so it&#39;s a non-issue, but she insists that it&#39;s just not fair to my <br/>
kids to have to learn all the time. The way I see it, she actually gets it. <br/>
Everyone walks around rolling their eyes, and I just wink at her. She tells <br/>
everyone within earshot, that I don&#39;t send my kids to school because they <br/>
mean too much. Older people are often like small children, they say what they <br/>
mean and they mean what they say. She&#39;s not of feeble mind at all, she just <br/>
figures everyone should do it because I do. As the first born grandchild, I <br/>
gave birth to the first born great-grandchildren, and 2 at a time just like <br/>
grandma. The cousins who have started families are already dreading what they <br/>
are going to do about school because I raged against the machine and <br/>
grandma&#39;s on my side. One cousing said thanx a lot, now we&#39;ll have to <br/>
homeschool or grandma will say we don&#39;t love our kids as much as you do. LOL<br/>
<br/>
Wow did I fall off topic or what?<br/>
<br/>
Peace to you and yours,<br/>
Rhonda<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Our twins are the first born only grandchildren on both sides, and so <br/>
far none coming up, so who knows what they will have accomplished by the time <br/>
someone else has kids.<br/>
<br/>
P.S.S. Kelli, you can borrow either of my grandmas, whenever you need to.<br/>

know this has been probably hashed out a million times but I really need<br/>
some wise words on how to deal with grandparents who feel my children are<br/>
&#39;missing out&#39; on opportunities.<br/>
This last week we, me and my 3 kids, were  visiting grandparents.     There<br/>
were several things that came up that they wanted my kids to go to, but my<br/>
kids chose other things.          Their cousins also live in the same town,<br/>
so they wanted to play with them the majority of their time.   Which I can<br/>
understand.                    But.....grandpa and grandma think we should<br/>
just say to our kids,  &quot;we are going to this concert,   we are going to this<br/>
function,   your are going to eat this meal....and so on&quot;.<br/>
They believe our kids will thank us in the long run, for the great<br/>
opportunites.       We said it was up to the kids.<br/>
Grandparents didn&#39;t say much to that.</div>

take us is what I look forward too. Yesterday I found my first gray hair, a <br/>
little tiny one in my bangs. I was so excited, I yelled for my dh to come and <br/>
look. He exclaimed,  &quot;you better pull it out!!!&quot; I looked at him like he was <br/>
nuts. I said, &quot;no it is my first hair of wisdom and I plan on keeping it.&quot; He <br/>
says I feel that way now because it&#39;s one little hair, but I won&#39;t be <br/>
thrilled when there are hundreds. I don&#39;t know, I think there is beauty in <br/>
gray.I have long black hair down to my butt, so I told him I hope I get all <br/>
the grays at one spot and then I&#39;ll look like Morticia.LOL<br/>

OK send them over,   Minnesota isn&#39;t too far is it?  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 That&#39;s great Rhonda that you have such open minded grandparents and relatives in your life! I keep hoping that if I keep talking about things with them,  they&#39;ll come around.    At least I&#39;ve learned to not get defensive about things,  that has helped.  I do wish my own grandma was around,     she was great.   I remember when she was alive.    My mom her daughter, would come to her complaining about this or that,  someone living with someone or something like that.    Grandma Dee would just say, &quot; ahhh,  it will be OK,  it could be worse.&quot;         I&#39;m hoping my mom will turn into her,   but I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s going to happen.             Aren&#39;t people supposed to mellow with age?     Although I know some people just intensify. peace~Kelli    <br/>

Away at the movie theatre today and I&#39;m leaving the younger two with my <br/>
sister.  The older girls and I are planning to wear our newest <br/>
project...we&#39;ve been drawing on our jeans.  They look awesome and we&#39;ve <br/>
had a blast expressing ourselves on such visable canvases.  But I just <br/>
know there will be repercussions from my sister (who has a 2 yr old) and <br/>
from my friends with young kids.  I&#39;m going to bet they don&#39;t want their <br/>
kids to draw on their pants.  Oh well.  The girls are so proud of their <br/>
new fashions and I am too.  I can&#39;t wait to see what comments we get! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1099817583">I&#39;m so sad! Due to poor planning on my part, we missed the movie by 30 <br/>
min. and had to settle for the Piglet movie. But we&#39;re going to get back <br/>
to see it somehow. It sounds like the kind of movie that can be better <br/>
appreciated on a big screen. Just got to find a sitter for the 2 smaller <br/>
kids. Hell, I want to see it so bad, maybe I&#39;ll just take them with us. <br/>
Anyway, it was a disappointment. Sometimes, following schedules is a <br/>
good idea, I guess. I&#39;m just not very good at it. HeidiC.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-563445175">Ahh so much to say on this topic and so little of it would be new &lt;g&gt;  I<br/>
have found that saying nothing to my mother is working out quite well.  As<br/>
soon as she makes any snippy comments such as &quot;Zak needs to go to school<br/>
he&#39;s bored playing with Max, he needs kids of his own age&quot; (that&#39;s when she<br/>
watched both of them for 2 hours when in that week alone Zak had 4 different<br/>
playdate, plus soccer and soccer practice, plus a homeschooling meeting,<br/>
plus a trip with daddy to Peter Piper Pizza to play games, plus pottery<br/>
class with other homeschoolers - one of our busier weeks).  That was the<br/>
time for me to grab the kids and go home.  Which was exactly what I did.  I<br/>
have decided that if she mentions anything again I&#39;m going to suggest to<br/>
read some homeschooling books (I already have a couple to suggest to her)<br/>
and that if she would like to discuss homeschooling after she&#39;s read those<br/>
books or aquainted herself with unschooling, I&#39;d be more than happy to<br/>
discuss it.  I know for a fact that she won&#39;t read any books.  She&#39;s already<br/>
told me that even though she knows nothing about homeschooling she knows<br/>
Steve and I shouldn&#39;t be doing it and that it&#39;s going to harm our children<br/>
and we are wrong blah blah blah blah blah blah blah!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I was saddened to read Connie&#39;s post the other day that after 20 years her<br/>
mother she didn&#39;t get it.  I guess I was clinging to the hope that<br/>
eventually they all get it, but then I realized there are those that just<br/>
don&#39;t.  I&#39;m afraid I have one of those.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Of well thank goodness for the support of others that do what we do and<br/>
those that don&#39;t that admire us.<br/>
