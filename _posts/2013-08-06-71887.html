<br/>
Okay, second favorite.  I still miss the first couple of years of Unschooling.com&#39;s long-gone message board.<br/>
<br/>
Greetings to my favorite of the surviving unschooling resources, ever!<br/>
<br/>
In post number 1,066 or so of Just Add Light, I botched a credit.    I&#39;ve miscredited photos twice before, but once it was Marty and once it was Holly, and all I had to do to make it better was to make a nice breakfast.  They&#39;re not reading that blog anyway.<br/>

But today it was Colleen Prieto, and she&#39;s too far away for me to offer breakfast, so I&#39;ve written this:<br/>

<br/>
ANOTHER mistake.  <br/>
What a week.  Okay, Day 11 of a hellacious week.  <br/>
<br/>
I pasted the whole wrong thing before, and that will be a clue about what the 11 days have been about.  I didn&#39;t mean to bring that here, and I&#39;m sorry I did.<br/>
<br/>

Colleen is probably laughing, I hope. :-)  Here&#39;s the right, originally intended, happy and useful and proper link:<br/>
