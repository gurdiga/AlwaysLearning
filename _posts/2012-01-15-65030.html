<div id="ygrps-yiv-605741447">I am a bookworm and am looking for books on Unschooling and an Unschooling lifestyle. <br/>
<br/>
I have read several minibooks on my Kindle, but nothing all that great. (Sandra Dodd, PLEASE have you book put into an eReader format! (Sandra Dodds book is next on my list)and I&#39;m currently reading  &#39;the unschooling handbook&#39; &#39;real lives&#39; and &#39;kids are worth it&#39; by Barbara Coloroso.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A few things that are basic in her book are. <br/>
<br/>
I will not treat a child in a way I myself would not want to be treated. If I wouldn&#39;t want it done to me, I have no business doing it to a child<br/>
<br/>
In everything we do, we need to leave a child&#39;s dignity intact.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, great reading for someone who is learning to change their way of thinking....<br/>
<br/>
Years ago I read a book written by an autodidact, a teen girl, not Grace Llewellyn and I can&#39;t remember the title. Anyhow, looking for books, thanks!<br/>

<br/>
If you can read a PDF on a kindle, buy it that way. <br/>
Of buy it in paper!  <br/>
<br/>
-=-I have read several minibooks on my Kindle, but nothing all that great. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I doubt if you got mine in paper you would say &quot;nothing all that great&quot; about it. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1689780349">Hi Stephanie<br/>
<br/>
These are a few of the books I have read, other than Sandra&#39;s =) which I personally found to be inspirational also...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Rue Kream&#39;s &#39;Parenting a Free Child - An Unschooled Life&#39; (Easy to read and enjoy another families journey).<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Parenting-Free-Child-Unschooled-Life/dp/1411641558">http://www.amazon.com/Parenting-Free-Child-Unschooled-Life/dp/1411641558</a> <br/>
or directly<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.freechild.info/">http://www.freechild.info/</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Jan Fortune-Wood &#39;Winning Parent, Winning Child - Parenting so that everybody wins&#39; (Very good at helping you think!! Well, it helped me think about my own automated responses to children and helped unblock some of my muddiness).<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Winning-Parent-Child-Jan-Fotune-Wood/dp/0954943309/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpi_4">http://www.amazon.com/Winning-Parent-Child-Jan-Fotune-Wood/dp/0954943309/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpi_4</a><br/>
She has other books too (I havne&#39;t read any others though) if you click on her name they should show up in amazon.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Unschooling Unmanual (A compilation of unschoolers experiences - easy to read and joyful).<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Unschooling-Unmanual-Nanda-Van-Gestel/dp/0968575455">http://www.amazon.com/Unschooling-Unmanual-Nanda-Van-Gestel/dp/0968575455</a><br/>

<br/>
All the best<br/>
