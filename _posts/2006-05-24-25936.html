<div id="ygrps-yiv-294498575">My two daughters are both really into ballet.  I mean like pretty much<br/>
the whole day in some way or other.  It costs a lot of money, but we<br/>
manage somehow.  One thing that helps is that my older daughter helps<br/>
teach the younger classes and gets tuition breaks. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I was telling my husband the other day some of the value we<br/>
are getting for our money.... (he sometimes needs reminding when I<br/>
send away for yet another pair of pointe shoes.)<br/>
<br/>
Both girls know a lot about classical music now. <br/>
They read ballet stories and ballet dancer biographies and ballet<br/>
magazines. <br/>
They have developed an interest in other dance forms.  <br/>
They have learned about their bodies and how they work. <br/>
They have learned about nutrition. <br/>
They are in great physical shape and are comfortable with their bodies. <br/>
They have learned choreography.<br/>
They have learned theater and acting skills.  <br/>
My oldest daughter has begun to make costume pieces and has found that<br/>
she has a flare for it. <br/>
They have learned teaching skills. <br/>
They have made life-long friends and worked through difficulties in<br/>
groups.<br/>
My oldest daughter has had public speaking experiences.  <br/>
Both now have an interest in the French language and are studying it. <br/>
They have interest in history of dance.  <br/>
My oldest daughter is learning to make a website for her ballet company.  <br/>
They have learned how to purchase ballet supplies and how to use funds<br/>
wisely.  <br/>
I also volunteer a lot and have made friends in that way too. <br/>
We have met some really interesting, talented, and artistic people.    <br/>
<br/>
I would say it is worth it.  <br/>
