<div id="ygrps-yiv-495047626">I am a single work-from-home mom of my alwaysunschooled daughter <br/>
Amelie; age 3. In a couple years we would love to travel nationally <br/>
and internationally and stay with unschooling-friendly host families. <br/>
I own the last issue of GWS (with 2002 directory)and the list of host <br/>
families outside the United States was a fairly short one. Does anyone <br/>
know of any links,lists, or other resources for hooking up with- <br/>
(first as pen pals) other unschooling families??? <br/>
THANKS in advance!<br/>

Since you&#39;re a couple of years out, I think the thing to do would be  <br/>
to participate on lists such as this, or AlwaysUnschooled (linked  <br/>
along with other lists here at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/help">http://sandradodd.com/help</a> ), try to  <br/>
attend an unschooling conference or two, and meet people the natural  <br/>
way--see whose writing you like, see whose children seem to have  <br/>
interests like your daughters, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Make friends by participating in unschooling activities online and in  <br/>
person.<br/>
<br/>
In the early days of GWS, those contact lists were started partly  <br/>
just so people would know that other unschoolers existed somewhere in  <br/>
the world, and maybe even in their own state.<br/>
<br/>
Nowadays, we know for sure.  There are over a thousand people on this  <br/>
list alone, and there are tons of other lists.<br/>
