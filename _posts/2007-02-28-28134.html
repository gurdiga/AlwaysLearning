<div id="ygrps-yiv-1410260204">HI My name is Sandy and I am in my 5th year of homeschooling. I am a  <br/>
unschooler want to be and will some how get there.. Yes I have curriculum here  but <br/>
its hardly being used. I wanted to learn and see what others are doing in a  <br/>
day.  <br/>
<br/>
I am Mom to a Son...17 years old and a Junior this year. He works a lot  with <br/>
his dad right now. Dad has a tree business and we are hoping one day he  will <br/>
take over.<br/>
 <br/>
I am also Mom to a Daughter..she is 14 years old and will be a High  Schooler <br/>
next year. She is very involved in Competitive dance.<br/>
 <br/>
Both of my kids are very involved in Bowling also.<br/>
 <br/>
So off to read a lot of the old messages  :)<br/>
<br/>
Sandy<br/>

If you want to be an unschooler, dropping any reference to school or  <br/>
school measures is one of the first steps.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks Sandra for the Link.. I have been looking it over.. Its so hard <br/>
to drop the Public School Image from our lives... I have gotten better <br/>
over the years but I always worry that we aren&#39;t doing enough or <br/>
learning enough..  Although I haven&#39;t been pushing things..my daughter <br/>
got a book out of the library yesterday and started reading.. She use <br/>
to LOVE to read..but she went through a time of Hating it..(thanks to <br/>
PS) but I am hoping she will get back into it.. Especially since I have <br/>
been reading more lately..</div>

Most of the kids at school are &quot;behind&quot; or they&#39;ve memorized for a  <br/>
test and forget it within a few weeks.<br/>

Hi Sandy :)  <br/>
<br/>
Congratulations on your brave decision! There is a book - The Teenage <br/>
Liberation Handbook by Grace Lewellyn that your kids might get a lot <br/>
out of.  Personally *I* am constantly deschooling and I loved the book <br/>
but my ds didn&#39;t get it as he has never been to a school (in or out of <br/>
our home).  On the other hand, his friends who have struggled with a <br/>
traditional school model (either in or out of the home) have enjoyed it <br/>
tremendously.  <br/>
<br/>
Best of luck to you! Chris</div>

Thanks Chris.. I read that book when I first started homeschooling... Think  <br/>
I should read it again :)<br/>
