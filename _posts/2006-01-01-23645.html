<div id="ygrps-yiv-2029215183">&quot;I agree with you about &quot;raised&quot; and &quot;graduated&quot; being problematical.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Heidi and I have often talked about not liking the term &quot;turned out&quot;.<br/>
People talk about how they&#39;re kids &quot;turned out&quot; or ask how you think <br/>
your kids will &quot;turn out&quot; if you don&#39;t do blah, blah, blah....<br/>
<br/>
When is a person &quot;turned out&quot;? At what age can you stand there and <br/>
say &quot;now I&#39;m turned out&quot;. It&#39;s really quite strange.<br/>
<br/>
Do you judge it at 18, when they become legal adults? Do you wait <br/>
until they get through their early 20&#39;s? Some people are a mess until <br/>
their 30&#39;s, so maybe THAT&#39;S when they &quot;turn out&quot;.<br/>
Such a bizarre concept...my kids are just living, just being. They <br/>
don&#39;t have to &quot;turn out&quot;, they can just keep on being themselves.:)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>On February 2nd, Keith will have worked at Honeywell for 20 years.   <br/>
Is that how he &quot;turned out&quot;?<br/>
He&#39;ll be fifty years old this year.  So...  How does he account for  <br/>
those other years.  Why did he not &quot;start his career&quot; until he was  <br/>
30?  What if he totally changes now and becomes a candlemaker.  Is  <br/>
*that* how he will have &quot;turned out&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Really good question!!!<br/>
