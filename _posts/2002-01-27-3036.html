<div id="ygrps-yiv-417937345">(muttering to self: have *got* to update will...) We&#39;ve pretty much decided<br/>
on family/stability over schooling. I hate that the decision comes down to<br/>
that, but siblings include one in Germany, a school-at-home family with<br/>
strict discipline and spankings, and a public school family with great kids<br/>
and even tempers. If we pick a sibling, it&#39;ll be the public school people,<br/>
even though my kids would be in ps, because I think the environment is<br/>
better. Recently our closest friends have started hsing, and I tried to loan<br/>
her a couple of books on unschooling but it made her too nervous. I don&#39;t<br/>
know if they&#39;d be an option or not. I really don&#39;t know any unschoolers IRL,<br/>
which is why I&#39;m here!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; DH and I were just having a conversation about needing to change the<br/>
&gt; guardians of our children in our Will...  We would want someone who would<br/>
&gt; let the kids still homeschool and the current guardians (my parents) would<br/>
&gt; have them in public school so fast you&#39;re head would spin..  Does anybody<br/>
&gt; have experience with this and what did you do about?  Or has anybody else<br/>
&gt; thought about it and what they are thinking about doing.<br/>
