<div id="ygrps-yiv-619752014">Hi Kendra,<br/>
<br/>
I just looked at the map and Gulfport is quite aways from Columbus. However,<br/>
we will probably go down that direction a couple of times a year at least,<br/>
because we love the ocean, and my youngest thinks he might like to be an<br/>
oceanographer or marine biologist when he grows up. (not many oportunities<br/>
for either one of those where we are right now!) I wish dh was getting<br/>
stationed at Keesler AFB instead of Columbus, but at least we will be within<br/>
less than a day&#39;s driving distance of the ocean after we move.  You are<br/>
welcome to email me privately any time. Let us know what MS is like, what<br/>
things to expect, places to visit (or avoid), etc.<br/>

&gt;Hi Suzanna<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m not sure where in Mississippi Columbus is.. guess i should pull out my<br/>
&gt;map!  I&#39;m in Gulfport and so far have had NO luck getting anyone together<br/>
&gt;down here. I KNOW there are other homeschoolers but they arent very<br/>
&gt;sociable. :(  I&#39;m in the planning stages of a Gulf Coast area support group<br/>
&gt;so we&#39;ll have to wait and see if I can pull anyone out of the woods :)<br/>
