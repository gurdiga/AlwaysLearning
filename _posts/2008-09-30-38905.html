<div id="ygrps-yiv-1500751575">I&#39;ve had a couple of small, but really cool moments that illustrate how <br/>
unschooling is working for us.  One has to do with food.  I used to <br/>
stress out over the fact that my 4 year old woke up practically begging <br/>
for sweets.  I finally gave up the notion that he had to have a certain <br/>
kind of food for breakfast ... and gave him the ice-cream he wanted, <br/>
with a side of candy corn.  Know what happened?  He ate much more <br/>
healthfully during the day than he normally does.  Seems he just likes <br/>
a burst of sugar in the AM ... so do I!  And regarding food, Sandra, I <br/>
LOVE your Monkey Platter idea.  My kids think that is just the best <br/>
treat!<br/>
<br/>
As we were in the car the other day, my 7 year old asked why the truck <br/>
in front of us was carrying nitrogen.  When I asked how he know what <br/>
was in the tank, he said, &quot;because I read it.&quot;  Oh!  This same child, <br/>
asked how long it would take to get to our destination.  When I told <br/>
him 10 minutes, he calculated the time of our arrival, taking into <br/>
consideration that our clock is 5 minutes fast.  I couldn&#39;t help <br/>
flashing to my school days ... how annoying would that be as a word <br/>
problem?  I love that for my son, these are things he arrived at <br/>
naturally.  No one had to coach him how to figure things out - he just <br/>
did it.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this moment of sharing is okay.  We are still relatively new to <br/>
unschooling (beginning our 2nd year), so these &quot;Aha&quot; moments just <br/>
really tickle me!</div>

Stories of &quot;aha&quot; moments are the best!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1770791380">I love that kind of stuff to... the other day I offered my 6 year old <br/>
a dollar for everytime he helped as a caregiver at a kind of <br/>
cooperative playgroup thing my little guys are involved in. He is <br/>
always trying to figure out ways to get money and he is kind of bored <br/>
there and I thought he would enjoy the money.  He kind of looked at me <br/>
a few seconds and said, &quot;how bout 10 dollars then it would only take <br/>
me 10 weeks to earn $100&quot;.</div>
