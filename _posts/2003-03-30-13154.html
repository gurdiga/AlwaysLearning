<div id="ygrps-yiv-898345414">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I was reading the list and thinking about a couple of experiences I&#39;ve had <br/>
lately with my older kids - that show how very much we can learn from them -<br/>
<br/>
Trevor (14) and I were skiing.  I looked back at him when we were getting in <br/>
line for the lift.  He had fallen over and was sliding into a fence.  Some <br/>
young kids were coming up in line and laughing at him.  It made me mad.  When <br/>
Trevor came up, he said &quot;that was mean&quot; - it turns out the kids had tripped <br/>
him (whether accidentally, or on purpose, I don&#39;t know), and that&#39;s why he <br/>
fell - I replied I wished I&#39;d have whacked them with my pole!!!  He just <br/>
smiled and went on with the day with total enjoyment.  Such a lesson for me <br/>
not to work on the revenge and negative stuff - just let it go, and be <br/>
happy!!! We were on the beautiful mountain, having a wonderful time, he <br/>
didn&#39;t let them ruin it for him at all!  Lesson for mom!<br/>
<br/>
Then I was in No. Dakota with Shawn (age 28) at his national diving <br/>
tournament a couple weeks ago.  (He won the 1 and 3 meter title for the <br/>
second year running).  He was so focussed, and concentrated, not taking his <br/>
skills for granted, and not caring about any of it, but doing his very best.  <br/>
He didn&#39;t start college til he was 23, or diving til he was over 20.  There <br/>
he is excelling at both.  I am so proud of him - especially knowing he had a <br/>
severe problem with depression when he was about 25, and on Monday will be in <br/>
Wash. DC at a press conference thing with about 8 others who have made media <br/>
messages about male depression that will be airing soon.  (He did a public <br/>
relations spot in TX for the clinic that helped him there, and that lead to <br/>
the national one.)  <br/>
<br/>
I think we need to be so respectful and kind to our children when they are <br/>
little and we have so much control over their lives, because it makes such an <br/>
impact over how we and they view the world.<br/>
<br/>
I DO have grown up children, and they are such a blessing to me, and have <br/>
taught, and continue to teach me so many lessons about life.  I keep hearing <br/>
my words from their mouths, and am please when they are kind ones :-)<br/>
<br/>
Enough for now --<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1185665274">Connie, <br/>
<br/>
Your accounts of 14 and 28 year olds were really great for me this morning.  <br/>
My husband and I spent an intense (mostly good) half hour this morning <br/>
talking about our kids.  He&#39;s mostly really  happy with them, but he seems to <br/>
think I&#39;m the only freak in the world that will protect the quiet in a house <br/>
so a kid can sleep until noon.  I told him there were others. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Your revenge moment about the tripping incident reminded me of times with <br/>
Kirby and Marty too, when someone&#39;s been mean and I&#39;ve suggested either they <br/>
just don&#39;t hang out with him anymore, or (worse!) &quot;Do you want me to talk to <br/>
him?&quot;   But with full-on calm, they&#39;ll say no, it will be okay, that he&#39;s <br/>
just that way sometimes and it&#39;s not really bothering them.<br/>
<br/>
They have a maturity now that I only got in some ways in my mid-adult years, <br/>
30&#39;s and 40&#39;s.  And they have some I&#39;ll  probably never have, because they <br/>
don&#39;t have a head full of noise and &quot;if only.&quot;<br/>

her back and caring enough to want to do something about &quot;it,&quot; if <br/>
requested, is enough to help a kid see his or her world as a safe(r) <br/>
place.  I think that&#39;s powerful stuff right there.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>    Nope not the only one.;-) Some days it&#39;s til 3 in the afternoon. My<br/>
oldest ds has been working on SPEED. No not the drug. ;-) It&#39;s a computer<br/>
thing. He gets wrapped up in it and works all night, or most of it. He&#39;s<br/>
tryed to explain computer stuff to me before but I just can&#39;t grasp it. I<br/>
have to remind my dh sometimes what it was like when he was working 3rd<br/>
shift. &lt;G&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>    Connie I applaud you for being on the slopes. I&#39;m way too afraid of<br/>
braking something. ;-) I&#39;ve heard the stories too. Some of the things they<br/>
tell me. I&#39;m glad I can&#39;t see them or hear the rude and obnoxious behavior<br/>
and comment. They, dss, handle it quite well. I think it&#39;s that maturity<br/>
Sandra is talking about.<br/>
