<div id="ygrps-yiv-809568935">Coyotes were responsible for several cats and at least one dog death out of<br/>
the town in suburban Dallas where I used to practice. I&#39;ve treated several<br/>
for odd bites received while they were supposedly alone in the yard. They<br/>
come along the creek beds and drainage ditches and are quite comfortable in<br/>
cities and towns.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of nights ago I heard hooting from the fireplace and we went out<br/>
and saw a large owl perched on the chimney (we&#39;re still in suburbia.) Way<br/>
cool, but my 7 lb. dachshund didn&#39;t get her nightly run in the yard! (She<br/>
and her 11 lb daughter are the smallest dogs I&#39;ve ever had, and the best. I<br/>
highly recommend small useless dogs now! :))<br/>
