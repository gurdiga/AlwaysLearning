&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m about to go play games with my collected family and two of Carol Rice&#39;s<br/>
&gt; kids.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My husband Keith left a card by my keyboard this morning.  He&#39;s really<br/>
&gt; careful about picking out cards, when he doesn&#39;t just get me to do it for<br/>
&gt; them.  So I know he read this and chose it for a reason.   It&#39;s long, but I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; going to share the text here.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ---------<br/>
&gt; Today I wish I could run back through time,<br/>
&gt; back to when you were little.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would try to find you on your birthday--in the middle of celebrating<br/>
&gt; or, even better, at some quiet moment when you were alone.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And if I knew what I know now, I would tell you:<br/>
&gt; Never forget the hope and joy, the aliveness, of this moment.<br/>
&gt; Never forget that you deserve happiness,<br/>
&gt; that your life is precious to so many people.<br/>
&gt; And never forget how very much I care about you.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ----------------<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And he came in and I was crying, and he showed me a grocery list and asked if<br/>
&gt; there was anything else he should get, and I couldn&#39;t read the grocery list.<br/>
&gt; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
