This part on saints has me laughing!  the rest of your post I&#39;ll need to<br/>
think over.<br/>
We dug out dh&#39;s old children&#39;s book of saints.  I looked through it a few<br/>
weeks ago.  I was struck by a) how vague it is;  b) how poorly written it<br/>
is,  and c) how it seems to glorify some behaviors that would likely put<br/>
most people into serious psychiatric treatment.  Like, as a child, St.<br/>
(Catherine of Sienna?)  allegedly locked herself in her bedroom for three<br/>
years,  and didn&#39;t speak. OTOH,  I respect thise who choose a monastic life.<br/>
Can hardly think a child in today&#39;s U.S.  would manage to pull this off.<br/>
And I remember a college prof talking about St. Catherine&#39;s nursing the sick<br/>
by &#39;sucking out the pus from the cancerous breasts of the sick.&quot;  ( I mean<br/>
no offense to anyone here!)  Recently,  we were trying out a &quot;Family Faith<br/>
Gathering&quot;....the topic was saints and when someone asked if I recalled<br/>
anything about St. C,  that was all I could think of!<br/>
    S...who&#39;s curiosity on this is going to cause a late night tonight, I<br/>
fear!<br/>

&gt; fasting account for them?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Something to ponder at this season of The Incarnation ;-)<br/>
