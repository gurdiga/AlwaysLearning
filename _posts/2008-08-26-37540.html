<div id="ygrps-yiv-1907663987">On our house we have a small mother-in-law apartment that we rent to a<br/>
single woman.  She occasionally has visiting grandchildren that visit<br/>
with my oldest son (almost 10).  <br/>
<br/>
My son likes to go into our detached garage and use the tools and make<br/>
things.  Spears, daggers, bows, whatever he thinks of at the time.  I<br/>
have asked him many, many times not to have the tenants children<br/>
inside the garage because of liability issues.  (It&#39;s a mess, lots of<br/>
&quot;dangerous&quot; things and tools)  I trust my son in there.  However, I do<br/>
not want to be responsible for the tenants grandchildren.  <br/>
<br/>
I just went into the garage to see how his project was coming along<br/>
and the neighbors grand-daughter was in there helping him.  She was<br/>
using a set of chisels that we usually make sure we are present when<br/>
my son uses them.  They are the sharpest thing we own at the moment.  <br/>
<br/>
First of all, I didn&#39;t really know how to handle this.  I am a little<br/>
irritated that he invited her into the garage and I didn&#39;t know about<br/>
it.  I asked her not to use the chisels, explaining that my husband<br/>
wasn&#39;t even comfortable with my son using them (Completely true). <br/>
Then I left them in there not wanting to break up the fun.  I&#39;m a<br/>
little lost as to what to do.  <br/>
<br/>
Should I explain to the tenant that her grandchildren are not allowed<br/>
into the garage or shed?  Should I suck it up and let them do their<br/>
thing?  How do I explain these things to my son respectfully without<br/>
him calling me a worry wort?  Any thoughts?  My worries about being<br/>
liable for for the tenant&#39;s grandchildren are getting in the way of my<br/>
parenting.</div>

<br/>
Remind him, later, not to have her in there without letting you know  <br/>
first.<br/>
Go in and hang out. Maybe find a corner to sit and read a book, if you  <br/>
want to just leave them mostly on their own, but with your eyes on  <br/>
them just a bit.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1943411570">Making the garage safer is also something that you could do.  If that<br/>
is too hard, maybe get a shed and move the things he can use to the<br/>
shed.  You could also talk about which things you are comfortable with<br/>
him using with the tenants grandchildren and perhaps they could be put<br/>
in the garage when there are visitors.<br/>

<br/>
Do you have homeowner&#39;s liability insurance?<br/>
<br/>
If so, and if the tenant is willing to let her be in there, and if  <br/>
you&#39;ve given the kids safety tips and guidelines, I don&#39;t see the  <br/>
problem.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-317990867">Yeah.  Your right.  I&#39;m glad I wrote on here instead of kicking them<br/>
out.  I&#39;ve had an awful lot of sleepless nights lately.  It gets in<br/>
the way of my judgment sometimes.<br/>
