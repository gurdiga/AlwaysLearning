<div id="ygrps-yiv-851996650"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; That&#39;s an interesting idea.  It makes so much sense that the junk food<br/>
&gt; would loose it&#39;s appeal if it wasn&#39;t a reward or a treat, it just simple<br/>
&gt; was.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s also important to remember that our children do as we do, not<br/>
as we say.  If you want your child to try new things, then you need to be<br/>
prepared to buy stuff at the grocery that&#39;s new to you, try different things<br/>
in restaurants, etc.  If you diet, do you diet by eating less of the usual<br/>
assortment of foods and increasing your activity, or do you make certain<br/>
foods taboo and special?  Is dessert a reward for good eating, or are you<br/>
and your children free to eat it or not eat it?<br/>
<br/>
These are the times when I figure I&#39;m the parent, and it&#39;s not that I need<br/>
to get on my bully pulpit and lecture because I&#39;M THE PARENT, but that I<br/>
make decisions sometimes to do things outside my normal range of choices<br/>
because I *am* the parent and my son needs to see me try those things.  I&#39;m<br/>
as guilty of getting in a rut as any kid can be, but how could I expect my<br/>
child to do something I wouldn&#39;t do?<br/>
<br/>
It took me awhile to get here, but I see where it&#39;s making a difference how<br/>
*I* live, not just to me, but also my husband and son.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1988779316">i wanted to share this experience yesterday, primarily for those on the list who are newer to unschooling, or struggling with truly letting go of food controls:<br/>
<br/>
so, it&#39;s been a year since we embarked on this journey of &quot;radical unschooling&quot; - and when i look back on my blog posts from last year regarding food, i am both struck by how even when i thought i got it, i didn&#39;t, and also by how far my son  has come on this journey himself.  in the last month or so, i have seen a tremendous leap forward in his internal connection to his body in terms of fullness/hunger, sleep/energy, need to move, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
today though, was a perfect illustration of the food &quot;issues&quot; that have dissolved with radical unschooling - and it did take almost a year!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
he has been wanting to go to the olive garden for a long time now, so today, when he asked, i said sure right away - it was a great day for it! so, he and i went, and when we got there, he noticed an amazing looking chocolate lava cake on the menu and asked if he could get it after lunch.  i said sure.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
he ordered pasta and an italian soda (and chicken that he didn&#39;t end up liking).  he ate some breadsticks and pasta and the italian soda was *so* good, according to him - made with cream!  he drank about 1/3 of it, and then said he was actually too full to finish it, and actually, too full for dessert as well.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
this is the kid who previously would have insisted on TWO desserts, asked if the soda was refillable, and drank/ate it all and then gotten a stomach ache.  he didn&#39;t even want to get it to go...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
he has really gotten to a place, i think, where he totally trusts that he will have access to whatever he wants to eat (that is available), whenever, and so doesn&#39;t deny his own hunger, or protien cravings, or desire for fruit, vegies, whatever - nor does he binge on chips or cake - or anything, really.  he eats when he&#39;s hungry or desirous, and stops when he&#39;s done.  it&#39;s a *beautiful thing* and so obvious, i can&#39;t believe it took this long for us to get on board. :) but considering how long it took us (9 years), it seems pretty impressive it only took a year for him to really trust!<br/>
<br/>
warmly, Lyla<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1099735436">I&#39;m wondering how to introduce more variety into Samuel&#39;s (6) diet.  He eats mostly things like ice cream, smarties, sprite, and cheetos.  He does eat cereal, pepperoni and yogurt tubes a few times a week. He will occasionally eat chicken fingers, homemade mac and cheese, and every few months a smoothie.  <br/>
<br/>
We have never restricted his diet or made him eat anything.  For a long time, I would let the kids pick out one or two things a week to add to what I would normally buy.  When what he picked was gone, Samuel would scour the cupboards for foods he liked and might end up with a bowl of sprinkles left over from a birthday.  Or he would look through the cupboards and not find anything he wanted to eat.  I know I can starve him into eating more, but I do not want to do that.  <br/>
<br/>
About two months ago, I started buying everything that Samuel wanted at the the grocery.  I was hoping that if he got excited about food, he would be more willing to eat everything he sometimes eats, and maybe try new things.  He is still only eating a few things.<br/>
<br/>
A few years ago used to eat tons a fruit and a few veggies and muffins and cheese.  His diet is now so limited and so low in nutrition I&#39;m not sure how he stays healthy, although he is.  He sometimes has low energy, but I don&#39;t see any other physical problems.  He is almost never sick.<br/>
<br/>
We have repeatedly tried monkey platters, but not with much success.  He sticks to the same few choices.  When he does try something, watermelon a few months ago and cheese the other day, he does not like it.  When he was younger he had a lot of allergies but has mostly outgrown them.  His reactions are now very mild or non-existent.  He was allergic to milk, soy, HFCS, and possibly nuts.<br/>
<br/>
I would really like some suggestions as I have tried everything I can think of.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(Full disclosure: I love Aletha Solter&#39;s writing.)<br/>
<br/>
I would say that there is a big difference between those two articles. The <br/>
first one continues to be about &quot;getting&quot; the child to eat what the parents <br/>
think the child should be eating with a bunch of strategies. It is not <br/>
really about helping the picky eater - who probably doesn&#39;t consider him or <br/>
herself &quot;picky&quot; or in need of any help. Picky is a judgmental adult&#39;s label. <br/>
It&#39;s about ways for the parent to feel better about being a good provider of <br/>
food or something. I don&#39;t like it much, even though the little games are <br/>
cute.<br/>
<br/>
There was a moment when the author says something about a father playing an <br/>
eating game with his &quot;picky&quot; young daughter and how if it were up to the <br/>
child they would have continued playing for an hour (but they didn&#39;t with <br/>
the implication that an hour would just have been unreasonably long to <br/>
spend). Well my experience is that unschooling parents routinely play with <br/>
their children for as long as their children ask them to - routinely as in <br/>
most of the time they make interacting the priority for its own sake, not <br/>
with some kind of ulterior motive.<br/>
<br/>
The second (Aletha&#39;s) is about finding acceptance by trusting your child.<br/>
<br/>
For me the first article can be safely ignored as being the nice end of <br/>
conventional parenting, the second reinforces exactly what long time <br/>
unschoolers have found.<br/>

&gt; There is also a part 2 on the website.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I did not like the tone of the first article.  We never sit at the table making Samuel cry about the foods he does not want to eat.  We never have.  I really am not trying so much get him to eat foods he does not like, just trying to get him to eat the ones he likes more regularly.  <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The tone was more respectful here, but still did not answer my question about how to shop.  That is the only part I can control and I&#39;m not sure which way to go.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure whether to buy every food he likes and keep the house stocked at all times with every type of chip, candy, cookie, and ice cream he likes so food is more fun.  Or if I should buy a little of that and more of the food I want him to have.  Or lots of one food and a variety of everything else.  I have tried all of these for a few months at a time, and he is still having 3 rolls of smarties for breakfast and cheetos for lunch and ice cream for dinner.  <br/>
<br/>
However, he is healthy so I maybe I should let him continue on what he is doing.  He is 6 1/2, 50 lbs and 48 inches.  He is rarely sick.  It is very hard to see him eat like this.  I have no idea how his body is getting what it needs.  The only vegetable-type food is ketchup and the closest thing to fruit is lemonade made from lemon juice.  He does like cod liver oil and his multi-vitamin, maybe he is living on those?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-798186068">I&#39;m wondering what your own diet is like.  Do you prepare foods for your<br/>
family that include cut up fruits and veggies, dips, nuts, fresh breads or<br/>
what have you and do you all eat them and enjoy them?  While my younger<br/>
daughter has always eaten less of a variety than the rest of us, I find she<br/>
does eat fruits, veggies, and whole grains more often when they are prepared<br/>
and we are all enjoying them.  She loves fresh raw green beans,  carrots,<br/>
corn on the cob, and she loves fresh fruit.  In the absence of those items,<br/>
she&#39;ll eat easy to find things that are sweet like Poptarts.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Time and exposure to new foods will open up his world more.  I wouldn&#39;t push<br/>
it or he may push back by being resistant to the idea.  Just keep eating a<br/>
wide variety yourself.  I find that kids learn best by example.  <br/>

<br/>
Buy what you want to buy to make meals.  Ask if he wants something.   <br/>
Get a thing or two.<br/>
&quot;Every type of chip, candy, cookie and ice cream&quot; doesn&#39;t even make  <br/>
sense.<br/>
If you used to seriously limit foods and that came with a lot of  <br/>
messages about how important it was and how wrong and bad he was to  <br/>
want other food, then it will take longer for it to change back,  <br/>
maybe, but you can make food fun without filling the house up with  <br/>
&quot;every type&quot; of anything.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Are you saying &quot;What do you want for breakfast?&quot; without making  <br/>
something that smells good, or some pretty pancakes, or a bowl of  <br/>
cereal with berries or bananas?   Are you leaving choices entirely  <br/>
(including ideas) to little kids?  Are you cooking stuff they&#39;ll like?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1213624131">When I was a LLL leader people used to marvel at my son&#39;s obvious enjoyment<br/>
of grapefruit.  My secret was that I liked grapefruit, and that I had never<br/>
strapped him to a high chair and force fed him.  There were many snacks I<br/>
bought just for me, assuming young wouldn&#39;t eat them.  My salad plate<br/>
inevitably got hijacked--children leaving the cookies aside to try my<br/>
crunchy salad.  If meals are fun and social and by invitation children will<br/>
join in.  If you eat monkey plates so will your kids--especially if it is a<br/>
family affair with a tea party to boot!  We had lots of fun tea parties with<br/>
fun finger foods and candles!<br/>
<br/>
Rowan is the most adventurous--and I discovered a short time ago homemade<br/>
granola was his fav.  The other guys also love homemade granola.  We just<br/>
melt some butter, maple syrup and water on low in the oven and spend a<br/>
couple of hours mixing it on low heat.  We have added dried cranberries,<br/>
currents, nuts, seeds and coconut.  It is so much fun.  Martin and Crispin<br/>
enjoy making it and eating it as well!  I assumed my kids preferred bought<br/>
cereals because they asked for them, until Rowan told me otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;We have never restricted his diet or made him eat anything. For a long<br/>
 </span></blockquote>time, I would let the kids pick &gt;out one or two things a week to add to what<br/>
I would normally buy.<br/>
<br/>
I also experimented with giving my guys money for food with lots of success<br/>
and I highly recommend putting the six year old in charge.  Rowan did a<br/>
fabulous job at about age three of doing the grocery shopping  for our then<br/>
family of three.  You might find yourself eating exotic mushrooms, red<br/>
peppers, lychee fruit and all kinds of surprises.<br/>
<br/>
I &quot;forgot&quot; about this success and it took me a while to twig that I could<br/>
have fun with food and kids again.  When Martin shopped with me he was only<br/>
interested in buying ice cream and candy, but when he held fifty dollars in<br/>
his pocket he was on a menu planning mission.  On those days no ice cream<br/>
was bought--but lots of chicken, scallops, shrimp, cheese, and artichokes<br/>
came home with us.  Martin doesn&#39;t eat potatoes so of course there were no<br/>
potatoes bought on his trips to the market.<br/>
<br/>
I endorse putting the kids in charge of the food budget!  Please do not try<br/>
to &quot;manipulate&quot; children into eating what&#39;s &quot;good&quot; for them.  It doesn&#39;t<br/>
work.  Instead adopt a healthy diet yourself, and enjoy your food--they will<br/>
enjoy theirs too, and will mooch all your special treats!<br/>

I agree with the second part.   I don&#39;t a child should be &quot;in charge&quot;  <br/>
of anything that affects the whole family.  Letting a child do the  <br/>
grocery shopping sometimes seems fine, but wouldn&#39;t there be a list of  <br/>
things other people needed or wanted?  Staples?  Regular purchases?   <br/>
Longterm and perpetual budgeting as a child&#39;s responsibility doesn&#39;t  <br/>
make sense to me.<br/>

<br/>
I found they weren&#39;t interested in planning on a regular basis, but it did<br/>
work on occasion to hand over some or all the cash, and remind them we<br/>
needed meals for a few days.   I did come up with my own grocery list of<br/>
things I wanted like flour, vanilla, buttermilk, baking powder and my fav.<br/>
foods, which I purchased or asked them to keep in mind.<br/>
<br/>
I noticed Martin (9) did pick out foods he thought I would like for dinner,<br/>
and he made a point of asking me questions to insure his parents didn&#39;t<br/>
starve.  He wanted the meals to work for everyone and really enjoyed this<br/>
challenge of being &quot;in charge&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The kids didn&#39;t go alone, but I made it a point not to interfere, unless we<br/>
were over budget to point out they hadn&#39;t enough food in the buggy to cover<br/>
enough meals.  The guidelines I provided--questions--were along the lines of<br/>
as &#39;can you think of what would be a good breakfast, lunch and dinner for<br/>
the next four days that you could buy for X dollars&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
We did manage to stay on a budget and it is less overwhelming to be asked<br/>
what you want for breakfast, lunch and dinner than &quot; what should we buy&quot;?.<br/>
The kids often just give me a list if they don&#39;t feel like going.  I don&#39;t<br/>
shop once a week, so I found I can give the kids free reign on one of the<br/>
days.  Anything we left out I could get another time.<br/>
<br/>
It worked for me to have some advice and guidelines and a budget available<br/>
and we talked about what we thought would work for the family.<br/>

<br/>
Change your goal from &quot;widening his diet&quot; to &quot;finding calm acceptance&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
You have said several times that he appears healthy. I think it is truly <br/>
time to stop worrying and allow nature to take its course. Trust that he <br/>
will expand his food choices as his nutritional needs increase with age and <br/>
growth. Keep having a variety available and release your anxiety. It might <br/>
take a whispered mantra, deep breathing, putting a big smile and saying <br/>
&quot;sure honey&quot;, or the mental affirmation &quot;All is Well&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Truly I think this problem is in no way about your son&#39;s diet, but about <br/>
finding ways for you to let go of your desire to control his food intake. <br/>
That is where your real struggle is.<br/>
<br/>
Change you, not him. This is what I did and do every day with the challenges <br/>
my daughter presents to my assumptions and beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
(I suspect this is unlikely from what you have said, but....) Is eating the <br/>
only place where your son has choices as you have described? Are there other <br/>
parts of his life that are controlled or manipulated, so that this is where <br/>
he exercises his only control? If so that might be a clue as to why he is <br/>
determined to protect his food choices.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH if he is living in joy, with lots of choices and support to engage his <br/>
passions, then I can only think that he is well and happy with the food that <br/>
is available to him and so his food choices are mindful and healthful.<br/>

He lives where you live.<br/>
Unschooling works well with choices.<br/>
Whether unschooling will work well at your house depends on you and  <br/>
your house!<br/>
<br/>
What we can do is help you see what has worked well in our own and  <br/>
some other families.   Any &quot;yeah but&quot; exceptions you claim will be  <br/>
yours to figure out, I think.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Since cave-man days, only a few people killed animals.  The others did  <br/>
other tasks to contribute.  If you yourself aren&#39;t killing animals,  <br/>
there probably wouldn&#39;t have been any time in the past however-many- <br/>
hundred-thousand-years that you would&#39;ve been expected to do so.    So  <br/>
possibly review your beliefs and priorities, and if your son&#39;s  <br/>
preferences rank below your philosophical beliefs, that will be  <br/>
between you and him.<br/>
<br/>
For unschooling to work best, it helps for learning and peaceful  <br/>
relations to be among the highest priorities.<br/>

I&#39;m not dictating my moral decisions to my children and they aren&#39;t dictating theirs to me. David and I make sure that everyone has options that they are comfortable with for every meal. If Simon wants steak and Linnaea wants beans that&#39;s the way we go. <br/>
<br/>
A big part of unschooling is recognizing that your choices are your choices. If you are choosing to clean the house, it doesn&#39;t make it everyone else&#39;s responsibility to tidy up too. It&#39;s your desire to have a clean house that motivates your actions. If you choose to not eat meat, that is your choice and if you have a child who likes meat, then that&#39;s his choice. <br/>

It&#39;s easier to turn down meat and eat alternatives than it is to make  <br/>
a meat alternative if the main cook is squeamish or opposed.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If a child has a need for, or a need to avoid, a food, that would be supported in an unschooling household.  <br/>
<br/>
My daughter is very sensitive about what foods she will eat, and I wonder how many of those foods might just not agree with her.  Her father had a lot of food allergies as a child, and her brother gets an itchy throat when he eats cantaloup, avocado, tomatoes, pineapple and something else I&#39;m forgetting right now.  She may have allergies as well, and is instinctively avoiding triggers.  I don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
But I think it can work the other way--that we may instinctively know what we need, and we don&#39;t want to get in the way of that for our kids.  <br/>
<br/>
The killing animals thing could be a pretty strong statement for a child to process.  And every industrial farming practice we use kills animals for food production--just some aren&#39;t well advertised.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I personally know no adults who eat as limited a variety of foods as you<br/>
describe your son eating at this point in his life.  So, likely his<br/>
repertoire will expand.  That said, some people (my in-laws for example)<br/>
prefer bland foods and a much smaller variety than I do.  They take comfort<br/>
in knowing they will like what they eat if they always eat the same stuff.<br/>
=)  They aren&#39;t unhealthy.  They are just different than I am.  I LOVE to<br/>
try new foods.  I LOVE variety and spice.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what else you can do to help other than being a good example<br/>
and laying off on him.  If he feels that you are trying to control his<br/>
consumption in anyway, it&#39;s possible he&#39;ll feel rebellious and do the<br/>
opposite of what you want.  Some kids are laid back and some kids really do<br/>
not like to feel controlled and will let you know immediately when you get<br/>
controlling by their response to your behaviors.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Be a good example.  Make healthy snacks an easy choice.  (which it sounds<br/>
like you already do)  RELAX!<br/>

As long as they don&#39;t ask me to make a second meal (which would be unfair to me), I won&#39;t force them to eat what I&#39;ve made (which would be unfair to them).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-679676757">Thanks for all the suggestions.  Rehearing what I already know is good.  There is no where else to go with these types of questions but a board like this.  I cannot even admit in public what he eats for not wanting to hear others reaction to his diet.<br/>
<br/>
He is really a kid who likes what he likes.  A certain plate, a certain chair, certain spoon, certain clothes.  It is not surprising he likes certain foods.  I try to remember it works both ways, he is just as discriminating about sweet food as he is about the rest of it.  He will not drink kool-aid, cola, many types of chips, most kinds of ice cream, or most candy.  <br/>
<br/>
I will continue doing what we are doing.  I will get more proactive about putting foods in front of the kids and myself.  <br/>
<br/>
On that thought, I would like to get two divided trays with covers.  Any suggestions?  I&#39;m thinking one to keep in the fridge and one to keep on the counter.  I put monkey platters together, but cannot cover and keep them.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much,<br/>

****He sounds just like Jared, he will only eat a couple of foods, doesn&#39;t want to try anything new. I ask him a few times a week or offer him something we are eating, he doesn&#39;t want it.<br/>
<br/>
He is healthy so I am not too worried at this time. He only uses certain plates, bowls, cups and utensils also. If his dish is dirty I wash it, I have offered different dishes, he doesn&#39;t want them.<br/>
<br/>
We need to trust them and offer new things and allow them to decide :)<br/>

&quot;It&#39;s not that I feel that school is a good idea gone wrong,&quot; he says, &quot;but a wrong idea from the word go. It&#39;s a nutty notion that we can have a place where nothing but learning happens, cut off from the rest of life.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1007594130">-=-As soon as my kids were old enough, I taught them how to make a few  <br/>
basics (ramen noodles, hot dogs, pb&j, cereal) that are healthy enough  <br/>
and that they like. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Did you really need to &quot;teach them&quot;?  Did they watch you, figure it  <br/>
out, did they learn how to make those things?<br/>
It&#39;s important, for unschooling thought.<br/>
<br/>
-=- As long as they don&#39;t ask me to make a second meal (which would be  <br/>
unfair to me), I won&#39;t force them to eat what I&#39;ve made (which would  <br/>
be unfair to them).<br/>

<br/>
Tit for tat.  Even Steven.  You don&#39;t scratch their back if they don&#39;t  <br/>
scratch your back.<br/>
<br/>
It might seem &quot;fair&quot; to you.   And it&#39;s basically what probably  <br/>
happens at every house represented on this list, but if you think of  <br/>
it in such harsh-but-&quot;fair&quot; terms, it&#39;s half a cup of rules instead of  <br/>
half a cup of love.<br/>
