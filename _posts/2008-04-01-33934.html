<div id="ygrps-yiv-2008250989">Hi folks. My baby is just 10 months old, but I&#39;m looking at a <br/>
situation which looks likely to last a long time so I wanted to check <br/>
in with you more experienced folks. <br/>
<br/>
My mildly demented, 90 year old, recently widowed grandfather had a <br/>
fall last weekend and was trapped on the floor for 1-2 days. He has <br/>
always been stubborn and cranky regarding health issues: refused Life <br/>
Alert, tells me I&#39;m crazy when I tell him that he didn&#39;t take his <br/>
pills, but wants to live forever, etc. At the same time, he is very <br/>
sweet and loving. My DH and I get a kick out of him, and he LIVES for <br/>
my baby and dog, who has had to come live with us. My mom, his <br/>
daughter, is similar. She has had cancer for many years, is barely <br/>
functioning independantly, can be very difficult about accepting <br/>
help, and often only keeps fighting because of the baby. I try to be <br/>
respectful of their desires/autonomy, but their judgement is often <br/>
impaired due to their medical problems. <br/>
<br/>
We are looking into buying a house that grandpa could buy into with <br/>
us, and probably mom could &quot;come stay&quot; in--more or less, move in <br/>
without selling her home, since she is not well enough at this time <br/>
to deal with it. <br/>
<br/>
I wish I were asking if I should do this!!!! But I feel strongly <br/>
about living my values, and that this is the right thing to do for a <br/>
variety of reasons. If nothing else I will no longer be dragging my <br/>
kid all over maintaining 3 households.  I am just nervous in general, <br/>
and nervous about unschooling my LO in this environment. Up to this <br/>
point, I assumed the likelihood of either of them living another 4 <br/>
years was unlikely, so DH and I made a conscious choice to not bring <br/>
up homeschooling. My mom taught HS, and my grandpa&#39;s life goal is to <br/>
see her &quot;go to kindergarten.&quot; I&#39;m not too worried about that--it&#39;s <br/>
more the idea of not being free to go out and do whatever she wants, <br/>
whenever, that bothers me. We should have some nursing help check in, <br/>
but I&#39;d expect to be the main person helping them out. <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have experience that you can share? I would really <br/>
appreciate it. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>
<br/>
Alex</div>
