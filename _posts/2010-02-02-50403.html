<div id="ygrps-yiv-123103589">-=-=, I don&#39;t know any 4yo kid who picks things on tv &quot;on his/her own&quot;. <br/>
In my experience, it&#39;s just not possible, because they don&#39;t know how <br/>
to read, and they don&#39;t know how to use a remote, or not well enough***<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-Here! Chamille did! -=-<br/>

-=Kirby did too, at four, and was playing video games. He could tell <br/>
video tapes and games apart by the labels without reading. The yellow <br/>
label was the six hour tape of Disney cartoons my sister recorded for <br/>
him. If he couldn&#39;t put the tape in, he could carry the box to me and <br/>
ask me to put it in.<br/>
<br/>
-=We had a Mac IIsi and there was a kids&#39; game called Playroom that <br/>
Kirby could play by moving the mouse and clicking, when he was two.<br/>

Yes, at 4 Tray&#39;s favorite game was Rebel Assault, a star wars game.  He usually had me fly through certain sections that he couldn&#39;t yet do.  I got pretty good at flying a tie fighter.  He also LOVED the Reading/Math Blaster series and  was disappointed when he had played them all and the next level game was so schooly, just not fun at all.  The remote control and TV listings were no problem even for my later reading children who could recognize their favorite shows on a list years before they could read a book.  These days, my youngest has access to hundreds of games via the web.  She Loves the kind of facebook games where you build a little world (pets, cafes, gardens etc) and interact with other users.  Interestingly, she didn&#39;t get the hang of the remote until age 8 or so just because she was more interested in the computer than the TV and her brother or sister or I or her dad were always on hand to find her shows for her.  But even with all the help, she still discovered things to watch that we hadn&#39;t thought of and shared them with us just as we share things we think she will like with her.  <br/>

I used to have to get Kirby (Mario) past the koopas at some point.   <br/>
He&#39;d take the remote back quickly when I got past those.<br/>
<br/>
He was fine with the swinging ladders and lava, but something about  <br/>
those turtly guys he didn&#39;t like.<br/>
