<div id="ygrps-yiv-1115581462">11. Don&#39;t pass on your own fears and hates about learning anything.  <br/>
If you hate or fear math, keep it to yourself. Act like it is the  <br/>
most fun thing in the world. Cuddle up and do math in the same way  <br/>
you cuddle up and read together. Play games, make it fun. If you  <br/>
can&#39;t keep your own negativity at bay, at least try to do no harm by  <br/>
staying out of it.<br/>
