&lt;&lt; Has anyone else had to combat this pressure from society, family and <br/>

 regarding unlimited TV?  I be really interested in hearing some stories<br/>
 about that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well....you could say the pressure in my family is like no other. I grew up <br/>
without tv, everyone in our church didn&#39;t have tv. It was villified to no end <br/>
in the entire church...still is.<br/>
It was implied that you were going to hell in a hand basket if you owned one. <br/>
&quot;Wordly influence&quot; and all that jazz.<br/>
Well, my entire family still goes to that church, and the anti-tv feelings <br/>
run strong. They don&#39;t give me any crap about it though. At least my Dad and <br/>
sisters who have all loosened up considerably over the years. One sis owns a <br/>
tv even. ooooooh.<br/>
My Dad will sometimes make some anti-tv remark, but never AT me, just in <br/>
general. He&#39;s  a really cool guy though, very much the type that can disagree <br/>
but not be negative or say anything. <br/>
If my one Grandmother knew how I did things from day to day, I&#39;d never hear <br/>
the end of it!!!<br/>

If *your family* has decided they don&#39;t want TV then that&#39;s what your family<br/>
wants.<br/>
<br/>
But if by &quot;my family&quot; you mean you and your husband, then what you&#39;re<br/>
wanting to discuss is restricting children&#39;s access to a resource. And it&#39;s<br/>
no different than discussing restricting access to books or the internet.<br/>
<br/>
If someone doesn&#39;t have TV reception and cable is beyond their means, then<br/>
it&#39;s useful to discuss ways that kids to get access to the world beyond<br/>
their horizons.<br/>

about my kids&#39; ages, who are feeling very isolated, who don&#39;t live near enough <br/>
to come in to Albuquerque very often, AND she says they don&#39;t let them watch <br/>
TV.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve written back to ask whether they don&#39;t even allow movies, and why.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s like closing all the windows.  Bad enough to live TRULY in the desert, <br/>
near where a new casino&#39;s being built and nothing more.  They jump on a <br/>
trampoline and play basketball, and while those two things are wonderful things, <br/>
they can jump on the trampoline all day and not see any Shakespeare or pictures <br/>
of Africa or hear Japanese drummers.<br/>

From reading Howard Gardner&#39;s stuff on multiple intelligences in &quot;Frames of <br/>
Mind,&quot; I just totally gave up my pro-text prejudice.<br/>
<br/>
I was a good reader and a &quot;good student,&quot; and I accepted that I was doing a <br/>
better thing by reading Poe and Dickens than just about anything else I could <br/>
have done.  I no longer feel that way.<br/>

I thought about that really hard, about why my  kids don&#39;t like books as much <br/>
as I did and I came to the conclusso healthy.<br/>

<br/>
I wish we could be TV free. There are lots of issues my husband just goes <br/>
along with in the parenting world; but not having a TV is not one of them. I&#39;d <br/>
also love to get rid of cable; what I could do with the extra $42 a month. So <br/>
the only happy medium is no television during the day and when daddy comes home <br/>
then it can be on. I&#39;m a lucky women because my husband is great; but oh the <br/>
TV. Good for you to not have the TV influence your children or family time.<br/>

<br/>
We got satellite two weeks ago because our reception has been so <br/>
scratchy and limited.  My son literally danced around the house singing <br/>
Hallelujah!  (Put a smile on my face.)<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re in that awkward transition period where I&#39;m still amazed how many <br/>
times a day he can watch Scooby Doo, and he&#39;s probably amazed how many <br/>
times a day I can watch Changing Rooms. &lt;g&gt;  (Two TVs.)<br/>
<br/>
Today we&#39;re off for a long day in the park with a small group of <br/>
friends, and an evening sleepover with an out of town friend.  So we&#39;re <br/>
achieving a decent balance.<br/>
<br/>
But any day now I&#39;m going to submit to the brainwashing power of TV and <br/>
start painting the house in hot colors. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Yeah, a book *without* pictures is not &quot;better&quot; and more sophisticated <br/>
than a book with pictures.  Pictures add content and moving pictures add <br/>
more content.  If one wants to provoke text-loving people, ask them if <br/>
they think National Geographic magazine would be better without pictures.<br/>

**When people who didn&#39;t watch the show anyway write and say &quot;I was <br/>
offended and won&#39;t watch your program again&quot; they&#39;re lying.**<br/>
<br/>
Well, I didn&#39;t watch the show because I don&#39;t watch TV news much.  But I <br/>
did read the full transcripts and I WAS offended.  I didn&#39;t need HSLDA <br/>
to tell me to be offended.  In my letter I said I would &quot;avoid their <br/>
news shows in the future&quot; because I didn&#39;t respect the thoughtfulness of <br/>
their reporting.  I also said &quot;I expected better from CBS.&quot;  I didn&#39;t <br/>
claim to be a faithful viewer who was breaking it off with them forever.<br/>
<br/>
I thought about suggesting that they fire the segment producer, but I <br/>
decided not to be that pissy about it.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-107947154">I&#39;m jumping in right here, after just joining, but what the heck.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t limit my children&#39;s tv time.  I do discuss with them shows that <br/>
I don&#39;t think are appropriate for them to watch and why, and we have had <br/>
no issue with that.  They have decided after viewing just a few minutes <br/>
of some shows that they have no desire to see people behaving that <br/>
badly, even if they are cartoon people (or animals or whatever).  I also <br/>
let them make the choice how much to watch, keeping in mind that there <br/>
are so many more wonderful things to do than sit and watch tv. After <br/>
all, it is all part of this world in which they live.  If they don&#39;t <br/>
ever see the bad or make their own choices for moderation now, how will <br/>
they be equipped to deal with life as adults.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, there is so much on cable that is wonderful for kids and adults <br/>
alike that I would hate to keep them all of from it because of some of <br/>
the rottenness out there.  If they are making choices to watch things <br/>
like Emeril Live, This Old House, Magic Schoolbus and other such <br/>
programs at 3 & 7, and self-limiting the time they spend doing it, how <br/>
can I complain too much.<br/>

<br/>
 I haven&#39;t been called stupid or been told that someone hates me in decades<br/>
- since being in school!  Yet everyday on TV, children&#39;s favorite<br/>
characters are calling people horrible names and treating them in<br/>
unimaginable ways - so which is normal?   As I mentioned in a earlier post,<br/>
we have discussed it and my dds came up with something that works for our<br/>
family but until we really looked at it they would have just continued on<br/>
watching, thinking it was normal and appropriate to treat other people like<br/>
crap.  As they get older I&#39;m sure they will choose to watch all kinds of<br/>
things and that will be their choice (as it is now), but to think it won&#39;t<br/>
impact them in crazy.  There are studies showing watching the negativity<br/>
presented on the evening news effects our bodies.     My kids are &#39;amazing&#39;<br/>
sponges and I do think it is worth a look at what things surround them.  <br/>
With them I have seen living peacefully gives them strength to deal with<br/>
the tough times and hard issues that inevitably arise in real relationships<br/>
not ones dreamed up by people that have a belief that kids are mean<br/>
spirited and can&#39;t get along with siblings or their parents.   But again,<br/>
for me it is not about TV good or bad, but about coercion.  We choose not<br/>
to be coercive and figure out together how to live peacefully as a family.  <br/>

mountains and we don&#39;t have cable or anything like<br/>
that, nor do we want it.  For me, I have trouble with<br/>
sorting, and the speed and obnoxiousness of commercial<br/>
programming, and so does my son.  The noise alone<br/>
gives me a headache, not to mention the video.  We do<br/>
have a moderate video collection, including a bunch of<br/>
kids&#39; movies, a fair sized collection of other movies,<br/>
and a handful of dvds.  My older son wants to be a<br/>
director when he grows up, and has a serious and<br/>
sophisticated passion for movies.  I expect one of<br/>
these days, when he is old enough to take care of it,<br/>
we&#39;ll get him digital equipment for making his own<br/>
films, which he really wants.<br/>
<br/>
The  kids watch 1 or 2 movies a day, sometimes more,<br/>
sometimes less.  We occassionaly sit in with them if<br/>
they are watching movies we also like, and every once<br/>
in a while hubby and I make popcorn and plan to watch<br/>
a movie in our collection we have not seen in a while,<br/>
or even more rarely we actually rent something.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re not at all versed in the current sitcoms,<br/>
cartoons or tv shows, and don&#39;t miss them at all.   <br/>
Between the computer, books and movies, I already have<br/>
to tear myself away to take care of my chores and<br/>
other obligations, and I&#39;m plenty busy with those. <br/>
The kids have the computer, the internet access, the<br/>
library and their video collection and don&#39;t miss the<br/>
commercial tv.  They occassionally catch programs at<br/>
cousins or grandparents houses, but they never lament<br/>
not having them at home.<br/>

OK! I have gone and read your TV Web page and I don&#39;t disagree with what you <br/>
and the other people have to say. I feel I am making the best decision for my <br/>
family my children are only 4 years and 18 months. Having the television on <br/>
all day is not something I want and I live here too. My opinion may change as <br/>
they grow older. They will have to make their own choices. Do you think at 4 <br/>
years my daughter should be the one deciding what shows to watch?<br/>
What about the influence of commercial TV? Do you not think that has an <br/>
affect on the gimmes and yes I did read about &#39;Magical Thinking and Spoiled <br/>
Children&#39; and agree completely. So does that mean I should not worry about commercial <br/>
TV? What about the news or just the news flashes? Regular prime-time news <br/>
coverage is not really something a 4 year old needs to hear about let alone a 29 <br/>
year old. <br/>
Is there a place for me in the chat group with my views on TV or should I <br/>
reconsider my involvement in this chat group?<br/>

emulate what they see on TV. They hang out with other families where the parents <br/>
aren&#39;t as nice to their kids, and with some other kids who aren&#39;t as honest as <br/>
they are but it dosn&#39;t make them want to be like those other families.  It <br/>
makes them appreciate their own lives more.<br/>

<br/>
When someone is mean on a show like that, the characters usually react to the <br/>
meanness or whatever and it becomes part of the story--how to deal with <br/>
frustration or bullying or whatever it is.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids were little, I watched a lot of tv with them and discussed the <br/>
characters&#39; motivations and personalities and what they might have done <br/>
differently. A lot of our conversations are still like that.  Marty, Holly and I <br/>
watched The Truman Show (again) last week, and it&#39;s interesting to see their <br/>
reactions to things as they get older and understand more.  This time, we talked <br/>
about the motivation and feelings of the guy who had played his dad, been put <br/>
off the show and came back.  We talked about the advantages and disadvantages of <br/>
being in a &quot;safe place&quot; as Truman was, but how is sorrow was real when his <br/>
dad (who wasn&#39;t his real dad but he didn&#39;t know) &quot;died&quot; (in the story).<br/>
<br/>
A few days ago Holly was watching Last Action Hero, and I wandered by and <br/>
&quot;stuck,&quot; and in a while Marty showed up.  It was more of the same discussion of <br/>
the nature of reality.<br/>
<br/>
I think anything that gets an 11 year old and a 14 year old hanging out with <br/>
their mom talking about philosophy and psychology is a pretty good deal!!<br/>

&gt;As I mentioned in a earlier post,<br/>
&gt;we have discussed it and my dds came up with something that works for our<br/>
&gt;family but until we really looked at it they would have just continued on<br/>
&gt;watching, thinking it was normal and appropriate to treat other people like<br/>
&gt;crap.<br/>
&gt;~~~~~~<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Why would they think that if it wasn&#39;t modeled in your home?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think my kids put much more stock in the way the actual people in their <br/>
&gt;lives behave than in what they see actors and cartoons do on television.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Tuck<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Same here. My kids are aware that our lives are different from stuff <br/>
they watch on TV. They don&#39;t emulate Homer Simpson or attempt to fly <br/>
like Superman. They know it is made up stuff. When we watch Eastenders <br/>
they are interested in why teens on that show don&#39;t speak to their <br/>
parents or why pupils on Grange Hill bully each other. Watching it <br/>
doesn&#39;t make them want to do it but they find the shows interesting.<br/>
In the same way I like watching Buffy but don&#39;t feel the need to go out <br/>
and karate bad guys. Its escapist fantasy. Sometimes its cathartic.<br/>
Its the same with adverts. They have never yet asked to go to MacDonalds <br/>
or buy an SUV or eat meat cos they saw it on the TV. We talk about how <br/>
people differ and just cos one family does something then it doesn&#39;t <br/>
mean everyone has too.<br/>
<br/>
If I wanted to keep them *pure* to my way of thinking then we&#39;d never go <br/>
out. Most of my friends eat meat. We don&#39;t. Most of my friends coerce <br/>
and &#39;ground&#39; their kids. We don&#39;t. etc etc.<br/>
They are capable of telling the difference between what goes on on TV, <br/>
other families and our family and making choices. They can watch stuff <br/>
without thinking it is &#39;ok&#39; or &#39;normal&#39; or even &#39;real&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
And if they didn&#39;t make their own choices about TV then it would be <br/>
coercion on my part.<br/>

<br/>
We don&#39;t have the television on all day.<br/>
<br/>
You live there too, but if your priority is your children&#39;s learning, then <br/>
limiting input is going to make that more difficult.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Do you think at 4 <br/>
years my daughter should be the one deciding what shows to watch?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think (from years of experience at these kinds of exchangs) that what <br/>
you&#39;re envisioning and what I would be talking about would be two extremely <br/>
different things.<br/>
<br/>
My short answer is &quot;yes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think she will even BEGIN to choose the shows you&#39;re afraid of.<br/>
<br/>
-=-What about the influence of commercial TV? -=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The influence&quot; so far is that they know that the broadcast is free because <br/>
the sponsors paid for it.  They were TINY little when we explained that <br/>
companies pay for advertising on TV, radio, magazines, billboards, and newspapers.  <br/>
When the boys were little they were glad to know what toys were being offered <br/>
at which fast-food places, and they watched for those ads.  Some toys they <br/>
weren&#39;t interested in; some they were.  They were discerning even about fast food <br/>
toys.<br/>
<br/>
Some people are teens or adults when they first realize that commercials <br/>
appeal to fantasy and self-image.  My kids have known it since they were young, <br/>
and so not only did they discuss it and get over it, but they&#39;ve freed up their <br/>
minds to think of loftier things.<br/>
<br/>
We got a copy of GQ (Gentleman&#39;s Quarterly) last week, for articles on three <br/>
guys Marty really likes (The Rock, Conan O&#39;Brien and Jack Black).  That <br/>
magazine is mostly ads.  Holly and I looked at a few and talked about how some <br/>
appeal to European fantasy, some to teens (not by SHOWING teens), etc.   We had an <br/>
English version (not of the same issue)brought by a travelling friend, and the <br/>
ads were really different.   <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s art, psychology, photography, commerce...<br/>
Holly is 11.  She understands things now that I didn&#39;t understand until I was <br/>
in college.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Do you not think that has an <br/>
affect on the gimmes and yes I did read about &#39;Magical Thinking and Spoiled <br/>
Children&#39; and agree completely. -=-<br/>
<br/>
My kids have never &quot;had the gimmes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tried to even change the words in which I will think about my children <br/>
and their environment.  There are LOTS of phrases used as put-down and <br/>
belittlement.  <br/>
&quot;gimmes&quot;<br/>
spoiled rotten<br/>
boob tube<br/>
junk food<br/>
brat<br/>
mindless tv<br/>
zombie<br/>
daydreaming (better connotation for some people than others)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s possible to have long conversations with other parents which don&#39;t <br/>
require much thought, which don&#39;t say anything original, and which are very <br/>
disrespectful of children as a class and as individuals.  Part of what got me where I <br/>
am today was a conscious choice NOT to go there.<br/>
<br/>
My husband was at a &quot;no children&quot; barbecue with people from work, and they <br/>
got to badmouthing teens.  What they were saying did NOT apply to our teens, and <br/>
it might not even have applied to theirs.  They were just having a canned <br/>
conversation about how irresponsible and stupid teens are, and how hard it is to <br/>
be the parent of a lazy teen who never thinks.  When Keith did say something <br/>
flattering about Kirby, our oldest, one of the parents made a dismissive <br/>
comment and they went back to their martyrly insults of people who had been <br/>
disallowed from the party.<br/>
<br/>
Parents do it without thinking. They do it about school starting, they do it <br/>
when they use terms like <br/>
rug rats<br/>
drape apes<br/>
just a kid<br/>
young&#39;uns (some manage to use that without insult; others intend to create <br/>
us/them)<br/>
<br/>
-=-So does that mean I should not worry about commercial TV? -=-<br/>
<br/>
It means I don&#39;t and lots of other people don&#39;t.  You can worry about what <br/>
you want to worry about, but wouldn&#39;t it be cool if your &#39;worry&#39; list could be <br/>
shorter?<br/>
<br/>
-=-What about the news or just the news flashes? Regular prime-time news <br/>
coverage is not really something a 4 year old needs to hear about let alone a <br/>
29 <br/>
year old. -=-<br/>
<br/>
My kids don&#39;t watch the news.  They could if they wanted to.  They rarely <br/>
choose to.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Is there a place for me in the chat group with my views on TV or should I <br/>
reconsider my involvement in this chat group?-=-<br/>
<br/>
What are you really asking?<br/>
Would you feel better if people weren&#39;t honest?<br/>
Are you looking for a group that says whatever anyone does is great and all <br/>
parenting decisions are equally close to unschooling success?<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re welcome to stay in this group, but if you express your views they <br/>
probably WILL be questioned and dissected.  It&#39;s part of learning about <br/>
unschooling for people to pick apart other parents&#39; theories and ideas and practices.<br/>

Why would an unschooler want to keep such an incredible source of information<br/>

<br/>
Just for the record, I had no tv for a time, then was rather restrictive about<br/>
 the whole thing, and now, with NO restrictions can honestly say that is BEST.<br/>
 Honest.<br/>
My kids have learned so very much from television and contrary to common myth,<br/>
 they do not watch all day or let tv &quot;rule&quot; their lives (althought<br/>
 they watched a TON for about 1.5 years).<br/>
They are avid video gamers also and we all love movies.<br/>
Learning is everywhere. <br/>
I would not choose to limit any method of communication from my children,<br/>
 radical unschoolers that they are, absorbing information as though by osmosis!<br/>
Give them access to the world, don&#39;t stand in their way, and you&#39;ll be amazed<br/>
 what a wonderful, incredible tool television is.<br/>
<br/>
My unlimited children will get just as excited about the periodic table of<br/>
 elements (Trevor this week) as they will about the latest episode of Cowboy<br/>
 Bebop.<br/>
Even my unlimited 2y.o. will walk away from tv, something I wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
 believed possible many years ago. He also asks me to tuck him in when he gets<br/>
 tired, another side benefit of freedom!<br/>
Unschooling requires that we, as parents, lose the prejudices society lays upon<br/>
 our schooled minds, and learn to see all modes of communication as worthy. In<br/>
 order to truly honor our children, they must make their own choices...which<br/>
 includes television viewing.<br/>

can be a valuable introduction to issues they might not encounter as<br/>
homeschoolers.<br/>

would play board games with ds, then about 9, while Laura and I had &quot;ER<br/>
Night.&quot;  One episode featured a 14 y.o. who was pregnant.  This opened a<br/>
discussion following Laura&#39;s wide-eyed &quot;She&#39;s *14*?&quot; which included topics<br/>
like compassion for young out-of-wedlock mothers (my maternal grandmother<br/>
conceived my mom at 14), abortion, birth control, STD&#39;s, waiting until<br/>
you&#39;re truly ready, etc.  All during the commercial break &lt;ggg&gt;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Having the television on<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And if they did want it on all day and you didn&#39;t then there are two sets of<br/>
incompatible desires. And the solution to that dilemma you&#39;re modeling for<br/>
your kids is that bigger, stronger people get to have what they want and<br/>
smaller, weaker people get the shaft.<br/>
<br/>
If we spent our childhoods doing what our parents wanted us to do and we<br/>
enter adulthood (and then parenthood) trying to fulfill the need to do what<br/>
we want, then we pass that legacy of neediness and unhappiness onto our<br/>
children. And our relationship with our kids isn&#39;t as joyful as it could be<br/>
because using our power to get our way creates an adversarial relationship<br/>
with them. <br/>

It&#39;s helpful in terms of building a relationship to recognize that children<br/>
have no power over the world. All the power they wield is what they get<br/>
through us. <br/>
<br/>
If our goal is to have our own way, then having kids isn&#39;t a good way to<br/>
achieve that. If our goal is to help our kids (give them the power to) get<br/>
what they want in life -- which is the goal of unschooling -- then we need<br/>
to recognize when we&#39;re being our own roadblock to our goal.<br/>
<br/>
Blocking our children&#39;s access to something they like (TV) is being a<br/>
roadblock to our goal. If you set your sights on helping them get what they<br/>
want out of life, then the things you want your way won&#39;t seem as important<br/>
as they did in the past.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean we should set our needs aside entirely. If we don&#39;t<br/>
respect ourselves, our kids won&#39;t respect us either. But it doesn&#39;t help our<br/>
relationship if we take away our kids power (that they&#39;re getting through<br/>
us) in order to respect ourselves.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My opinion may change as<br/>
&gt; they grow older. They will have to make their own choices.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The more help and practice they have when they&#39;re younger trying to get what<br/>
they want (on things that aren&#39;t dangerous), the easier it will be when they<br/>
have the power and freedom to do whatever they want with choices that are<br/>
dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
Learning how to make choices between TV shows is much safer than learning<br/>
how to make choices when cars and alcohol are available.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you think at 4<br/>
&gt; years my daughter should be the one deciding what shows to watch?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes.<br/>
<br/>
At 4 does she go to the adult section of the library and pull out The Joy of<br/>
Sex and full color photos of war? Those things just don&#39;t interest kids.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter has always been able to choose what she wanted to watch. She<br/>
didn&#39;t much care about flipping through channels at 4 but by 6 she would<br/>
search for the stations that had cartoons. She&#39;d pass by anything live<br/>
action.<br/>
<br/>
There isn&#39;t any reason for little kids to be watching shows that we fear<br/>
they&#39;ll watch. They won&#39;t want to see the news or sex or violence. It just<br/>
doesn&#39;t interest them. (And if it does, then it&#39;s likely there&#39;s something<br/>
else going on in their lives that they need help with.)<br/>
<br/>
(There are, though, kids who develop deep compassion early who can be upset<br/>
by images of people being mean to each other. Rather than avoiding TV, we<br/>
can help them have power over TV by helping them figure out ways to get to<br/>
what they want on TV while avoiding seeing the things they don&#39;t want to<br/>
see.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What about the influence of commercial TV? Do you not think that has an<br/>
&gt; affect on the gimmes and yes I did read about &#39;Magical Thinking and Spoiled<br/>
&gt; Children&#39; and agree completely. So does that mean I should not worry about<br/>
&gt; commercial TV?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You can talk about advertisements with them to give them power over them.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s more helpful to use commercials for things the kids don&#39;t want<br/>
-- adult stuff like laundry detergent and toys that don&#39;t interest them --<br/>
for discussion rather than using the commercials for things they want. If we<br/>
use commercials for things they want the kids will recognize the agenda<br/>
isn&#39;t commercial awarenes but is really about convincing them they&#39;re being<br/>
decieved and manipulated into wanting that product.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What about the news or just the news flashes? Regular prime-time news<br/>
&gt; coverage is not really something a 4 year old needs to hear about let alone a<br/>
&gt; 29 year old.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My daughter has told me that news flashes don&#39;t seem real to her. And we&#39;ve<br/>
talked about that being advertising for the news. The stations want us to<br/>
watch the news so they make it sound like the sky is falling so we&#39;ll feel<br/>
like we have to watch it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is there a place for me in the chat group with my views on TV or should I<br/>
&gt; reconsider my involvement in this chat group?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As in a place where people can comfortably share the walls they&#39;ve built up<br/>
around their fears rather than examining whether those fears have<br/>
foundations and discussing ways to deal with the fears?<br/>
<br/>
Building and maintaining walls against what we fear is always much easier<br/>
than examining and dealing with fears. But walls give power to the things we<br/>
fear beyond what they have. Knowledge helps us understand what the true<br/>
power is of the things we fear and gives us power over them.<br/>

You&#39;re welcome to stay in this group, but if you express your views they <br/>
probably WILL be questioned and dissected. <br/>
Well, isn&#39;t this why I&#39;m hear to broaden my views and opinions. Which will <br/>
hopefully make me a more open minded parent/person. I like the idea of people <br/>
giving honest opinions on subjects. No one said I had to agree; but I&#39;m willing <br/>
to think about it. <br/>
