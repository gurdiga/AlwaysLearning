very comfortable. He&#39;s responsible enough that I am not concerned about his <br/>

ever said he was bored, which is what leads to strange and potentially <br/>
dangerous activites. <br/>
<br/>

it...maybe a year ago?  <br/>

Last fall I had to be away from home for over a month. His other two parents  <br/>
(my partner and Julian&#39;s dad) worked out the places Julian needed to go, <br/>
etc., and he did choose to be home alone some of the time. But he also spent <br/>
a lot of time with Beth at work, mostly so he wouldn&#39;t be lonely. <br/>
<br/>
From what you&#39;ve said, I think when Brianna is not in pain, she&#39;d probably be <br/>
fine for a few hours, if she feels comfortable with it. Obviously, leaving <br/>
your cell number and maybe the number of someone else is a good idea.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-950210206">Thanks so much. Raising Brianna is the best thing that&#39;s ever happened to me.<br/>
So many people comment on how &quot;lucky Brianna is&quot; to have me - so few see that this works both ways. <br/>
Frankly, I think I&#39;m getting the better end of this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1094951610"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Anyway just my 2 cents.....behave over there.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do TRY to behave.  I realize that I&#39;m more visable because of being a<br/>
foster parent for the army.<br/>
<br/>
I do see the Army&#39;s point (and yours, Pam) about the Army sponsoring us in a<br/>
foreign country, etc.  But the vast majority of the problems come from the<br/>
enlisted soldiers, not unsupervised-for-15-minutes 9 and 10 year old<br/>
children!  The point I&#39;ve been trying to make to the army is that when they<br/>
write a regulation like that (NO unsupervised time before 11 years, period),<br/>
they set kids up for failure.  Children need chances to learn and build<br/>
trust with their parents.  Turning 11 years old does NOT guarantee you know<br/>
anything about staying alone for 3 hours.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been asking the army to re-write the regulations in a way that would<br/>
acknowledge that while a child under a certain age (5 and under?) should<br/>
never be left alone, and that an older child (under 11, if they like)<br/>
shouldn&#39;t be left alone for hours, possibly the children in the middle<br/>
(6-10?) could be left alone for 15-30 minutes, WITH parental discretion.  We<br/>
know our kids, and we also know we&#39;re responsible for their actions here.<br/>
<br/>
Most people I talk to (and I have tallked to a lot of people here about this<br/>
issue) say it&#39;s not the long trips that irritate their kids, the kids<br/>
understand those.  It&#39;s when you need to run over to the little shop 2<br/>
blocks away and grab some milk and bread, or go to a friend&#39;s apartment on<br/>
the other side of the road but out of sight for 10 minutes, drive another<br/>
child to an activity, etc.  The kind of trips you&#39;d make in the states and<br/>
possibly not have to think twice about, but living in housing, we have to<br/>
weigh the possibility that some nosy neighbor with nothing better to do<br/>
would report you for leaving your kids alone.<br/>
<br/>
As my son gets older, I understand why so many people *don&#39;t* &quot;behave&quot;,<br/>
because they trust their children and want to give them opportunity to be<br/>
trustworthy.  But they live in fear of the Army&#39;s social services people,<br/>
and that&#39;s just wrong.  IMHO.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Also, having lived in several different housing areas in Germany, there are <br/>
many German, and other, civilians that come through the housing areas looking <br/>
for work.  Like washing your car for 5 marks etc.  Some are there to cause <br/>
trouble, they will charge 5 marks and when the job is done they will say it <br/>
was 50 marks and get the MPs involved etc.  They will knock on doors and <br/>
things of that nature to find people and will basically harass you to get <br/>
work.  I have seen them go up to kids to try to get money.  I would hesitate <br/>
about leaving children alone in a military housing area unless it is closed.<br/>
<br/>
Although I understand what you are saying, It would be nice to have a little <br/>
more room to make parental decisions on the issue.  I never ran into that as <br/>
my boys were born in Germany but were 3 and 6 months when we left.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway good luck on changing the regulation.  If they even did consider <br/>
changing the regulation it takes so much that you will be long gone before <br/>
the change would go into effect.  LOL<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All housing areas and bases overseas are now closed, fenced, and guarded.<br/>
In some ways, I think that&#39;s worse to live with, but it&#39;s safer that way, or<br/>
so they tell me.  I have been here since August of 2001, and so much changed<br/>
with 9-11.  <br/>
