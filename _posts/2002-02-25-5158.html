<div id="ygrps-yiv-2018863293">Hi, my name is Debra. I am mother to Eimilee, Jacob, Samuel, and Aaron. Wife to Jeff. I have always homeschooled, never using a curriculum, very laid back. But lately have even more stepped back but have increased the<br/>
learning experiences around the house- more library trips, great learning videos, trips out of the house, trying make more of our everyday routine a learning experience. And the kids are loving it. I started keeping a log of<br/>
every learning experience they have on a daily basis without me sitting them down with a book and pencil. It was amazing.<br/>
Currently we live in Astoria, Or but are looking at moving to the Carson City Nevada area in 6 months to a year. Anyone here unschool in Nevada??<br/>
We are creative people.. hubby a guitarist and computer geek as well as a kite boarder, I spin wool and other fibers with drop spindle and wheel, knit, crochet and weave. I also am venturing out to make my own wooden<br/>
knitting needles for sale on ebay from exotic woods. We are working hard at starting our own business reselling online.<br/>
We homeschool purely for religious reasons. We love homeschooling and couldn&#39;t imagine sending them off to public school. We love learning together as a family.<br/>
Blessings,debra</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-497652847">I was looking up unschooling math and found Sandra&#39;s page- I have devoured it, then saw this group mentioned. so hear I am..<br/>
I have 6 children ages 18 months to 15 years.. We have always homeschooled- unschooled at times but after 10 years of homeschooling I am finally truly understanding what it is to unschool.<br/>
I do have a question though... video games.. mario to be exact.. I saw it mentioned in the math articles.. could someone explain to me how playing Mario is related to math- so I can explain it to my husband :-) <br/>
thanks, debra<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Mario&quot; isn&#39;t specific enough.  What video game systems do you have?   <br/>
What games are your kids playing?<br/>
<br/>
Lots of things are collected here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/videogames">http://sandradodd.com/videogames</a><br/>
<br/>
No one game &quot;teaches&quot; math. My kids did play some very math-specific  <br/>
games, mostly logic and patterns games (Zoombinis, Treasure Math  <br/>
Storm).   My guess is that your husband and you are thinking of math  <br/>
in a schoolish way and looking for &quot;math lessons&quot; instead of changing  <br/>
the way you perceive mathematics in the real world.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-331186584">I should have been more clear.. I was just curious about video games and whether it was using logic, puzzle solving, etc... Mario- all I could think was that it used puzzle solving techniques. <br/>
I read the whole math page you listed and am in agreement..when I was talking to my 13 year old son he was too curious about Mario. He likes Sim City, Roller Coaster Tycoon and Line Writer.. He can totally see how is using math skills playing those games- but not so much so with Mario. <br/>
They play Nintendo DS and on the computer. I have 5 boys and 1 daughter. The daughter knits, bakes and is learning to quilt. We can totally see where she is using math :-).. the boys- especially the older boys love the computer and video games. <br/>
I understand that the games don&#39;t teach math- I guess I meant what math skills are used. <br/>
Thanks so much for replying.<br/>

<h4>ENSEMBLE S-WAYNFORTH</h4>
<time>15 Feb 2008, at  3:21pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1178243197">Super Mario Galaxy has cool gravitational force stuff going on. Really cool stuff. I get lost sometimes in the beauty of the game and forget to play. Paper Mario is all about working in two dimensions and three dimensions. Again a stunning demonstration of something bland and dull sounding on paper. It is all logic and puzzle solving. But it isn&#39;t separate from story telling or geography or art. Just like most things exist in an overlap with other subjects if you are looking to make a list of how they fit one school curriculum or another. But Mario is about having a good time and playing on a video game. It may become a reference point for something else. Talking about orbits and gravity and all of those things might lead to or from Super Mario Galaxy or not. Maybe those experiences will just be about the pleasure of the game. <br/>
<br/>
I was playing World of Warcraft today with Simon and Linnaea. Simon wanted to take my new character somewhere and I just followed him. He new how to get from the land we were in through 2 other lands so quickly. It was wonderful to follow where he led. His navigational skills in the game are fantastic. I don&#39;t know if that will predispose him to orienteering or being able to find his way around London or somewhere else, but it was awesome to sit at my computer while he sat at his and just see him negotiate within this massive world. <br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you are still standing on the precipice contemplating unschooling. It sounds like unschooling is this scary chaos in front of you and you can&#39;t quite see how it works, but you want to, but you also want to know that your children will still be well-versed in the basics. There aren&#39;t subjects in real life. Life isn&#39;t divided up into English and Geometry and Calculus and European History and U.S. History and Social Studies. They all blend. History is rife in English and Geometry, and vice versa. One thing leads to another not in linear fashion but in a more immersive one. Say you get fascinated by knitting, I have this brilliant book on how to knit a traditional fisherman sweater. It has pictures of poor waifs with sharpened pieces of wire knitting Ganseys for a living or for relatives. The waifs lived not far from where I live now, but I got the book in Albuquerque. There is a moment of history. There is information about animal husbandry,<br/>
 or about which breed of sheep or goat you use to get your wool from, if you want it. There is counting and designing and adjusting. There is the smell of the lanolin, the feel of raw wool, finding bits of it when you walk out near a field where sheep are kept and taking it home to see if you can spin it. There is the moments when you sit with others knitting in a circle chatting about something else while trying not to drop a stitch. And I don&#39;t know which of any of those moments, of those reference will be valuable, will make a knitter a better employee, a better adult. Maybe none of them will. But they all are learning moments, they are all part of the context of knitting. It is the same with video games. Maybe it is the emotional skills of dealing with frustration and coming up with techniques so that you can walk away when it is too much and come back when you are ready. Maybe it is the math, the programming, the logic, the story telling. Maybe it<br/>
 is the sitting next to your brother watching in awe as he rescues Princess Peach with such finesse that will help to make you a stronger person, a more grounded person who knows that his family is there for him and because of that you won&#39;t have any problem reaching for the stars. <br/>

I <br/>
should <br/>
have <br/>
been <br/>
more <br/>
clear.. <br/>
I <br/>
was <br/>
just <br/>
curious <br/>
about <br/>
video <br/>
games <br/>
and <br/>
whether <br/>
it <br/>
was <br/>
using <br/>
logic, <br/>
puzzle <br/>

etc... <br/>
Mario- <br/>
all <br/>
I <br/>
could <br/>
think <br/>
was <br/>
that <br/>
it <br/>
used <br/>
puzzle <br/>
solving <br/>
techniques. <br/>
I <br/>
read <br/>
the <br/>
whole <br/>
math <br/>
page <br/>
you <br/>
listed <br/>
and <br/>
am <br/>
in <br/>
agreement..when <br/>
I <br/>
was <br/>
talking <br/>
to <br/>
my <br/>
13 <br/>
year <br/>
old <br/>
son <br/>
he <br/>
was <br/>
too <br/>
curious <br/>

He <br/>
likes <br/>
Sim <br/>

Roller <br/>

and <br/>
Line <br/>
Writer.. <br/>
He <br/>
can <br/>
totally <br/>
see <br/>
how <br/>
is <br/>
using <br/>
math <br/>
skills <br/>
playing <br/>
those <br/>
games- <br/>
but <br/>
not <br/>
so <br/>
much <br/>
so <br/>
with <br/>
Mario. <br/>
They <br/>
play <br/>
Nintendo <br/>
DS <br/>
and <br/>
on <br/>
the <br/>

I <br/>
have <br/>
5 <br/>
boys <br/>
and <br/>
1 <br/>
daughter. <br/>
The <br/>
daughter <br/>
knits, <br/>
bakes <br/>
and <br/>
is <br/>
learning <br/>
to <br/>
quilt. <br/>
We <br/>
can <br/>
totally <br/>
see <br/>
where <br/>
she <br/>
is <br/>
using <br/>

the <br/>

especially <br/>
the <br/>
older <br/>

mostly <br/>
logic <br/>
and <br/>

(Zoombinis, <br/>
Treasure <br/>

My <br/>
guess <br/>
is <br/>
that <br/>
your <br/>
husband <br/>
and <br/>
you <br/>
are <br/>
thinking <br/>
of <br/>
math <br/>
  <br/>
in <br/>
a <br/>

looking <br/>

<br/>
Holly says she&#39;s played it, but doesn&#39;t know it very well.<br/>
<br/>
The original Mario game is where Kirby learned map reading (from  <br/>
using a player&#39;s guide).  He learned deductive reasoning, too, from  <br/>
the bonus round, which only had eight different permutations (all  <br/>
shown in the player&#39;s guide) so if he made a good couple of early  <br/>
guesses (I would help him) he could figure out which map it was and  <br/>
just fill in the matching items and get the bonus power/life/whatever.<br/>
<br/>
In both cases, it wasn&#39;t simply playing the game, but learning ABOUT  <br/>
the game and how to play it more effectively that created the great  <br/>
learning opportunities.<br/>
<br/>
I think instead of focussing so narrowly on wanting to prove that  <br/>
EVERY game has everything (or that any one game has math) you should  <br/>
look at some of the articles linked on that videogames page that  <br/>
discuss the kind of thinking involved, and not focus so schoolishly  <br/>
on &quot;math.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1585812378">Thank you for your replies. I think I totally misrepresented myself. I have been homeschooling for 10 years. We have lots of curriculum around here but never really got into it. The kids just don&#39;t like canned curriculum.. then came the realization that I have incredibly creative children. Sitting down to schoolwork was just defeating the purpose and squelching their creativity. My daughter taught herself (with little help from dad who is an amazing guitarist) how to play guitar over 6 months. She was online looking up guitar chords and practicing and practicing. then she got to the point where she could dissect a song and learn how to play it even if she couldn&#39;t find the chords online.. <br/>
We had a very crazy year last year.. in light of all this the kids wanted something more structured, I bartered for SOS computer curriculum.. They enjoyed it for a season but after that they done.. It became a struggle. That is where we are now. <br/>
My dh broke his ankle 3 weeks ago and has been home. It has been stressful- the house is a mess, I am pulling my hair out. So it was time for this mommy to help the children get refocused on what they wanted to do. <br/>
As far as the computer games- we were just interested in the type of thinking involved. I didn&#39;t want a list that proved that this video game covered this subject.. My 13 yr old is finding this all so interesting. My dh and I are as well. <br/>
It has been a great while since the kids have sat down to &quot;do&quot; math. It has always been my position that they would learn what they need to when they need to. And I see math being done in real life daily. Sometimes my dh needs more- so I pass on information to him. <br/>
I love to learn that is why I joined the list. I had never realized how much thinking skills went into video games. Of course I was a kid when pac man, frogger and donkey kong were the fore front of video games- remember intelevision?<br/>
Thank you again for your patience with me,<br/>

<br/>

concepts!<br/>
<br/>
Which brings me to the great amount of chatting we have had about HOW these<br/>
amazing games are thought of and created. Talk about creativity and<br/>
mathematical thinking! All of that visual and conceptual mastery comes down<br/>
to programming on itsy bitsy levels...just fascinating...<br/>
