<div id="ygrps-yiv-2069110470"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I had this sudden realization that Duncan learns through GAMES! And <br/>
&gt;WHAT A WAY TO LEARN!!!! How COOL to think that learning is SO much fun! <br/>
&gt;I got his huge smile on my face as I got this.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think it is so incredibly neat that he has this opportunity---and <br/>
&gt;that he finds his learning that way!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That&#39;s Dunc&#39;s &quot;curriculum&quot;---games! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d be interested in discussing this further, though the topic has already been covered and the discussion is an obvious one.<br/>
<br/>
I have a 12 yr old ds like this.  He loves games.  Plays cards, dominio, mancala with his sister, plays computer games and video games, has several 500-750-1000 piece puzzles under construction in his room, etc. He adores Wordly Wise vocabulary books (says it&#39;s his favorite book) because it&#39;s like a big puzzle book for him.  Go figure!<br/>
<br/>
So, where will this lead him?  What career fields and people can I &quot;strew&quot; in his path to come into contact with?<br/>

career fields will book readers be drawn to?<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;ll help him more by looking at what he&#39;s interested in <br/>
rather than the format that he approaches it through.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I recommend neither, as he&#39;s 12.  Maybe all his puzzle and game  interests <br/>
will lead to his being a ballet dancer or a truck driver who&#39;s really  <br/>
interested in puzzles and games in his spare time.   Maybe he&#39;ll be a  mathematician or <br/>
an engineer or a designer of strategy games (with cards or  books or <br/>
computers).  Maybe he&#39;ll be an artist.  <br/>
 <br/>
As they come up naturally, mention whatever career fields there are in the  <br/>
world regardless of whether they seem to math his 12 year old  fascinations.   <br/>
Help him meet all kinds of people, not just those you  want him to &quot;grow up to <br/>
be like.&quot;  If you channel him toward a career or  specialty, you might be <br/>
guessing wrong, and you might accidentally cause him to  want to do anything <br/>
besides what you&#39;re pushing toward (no matter how subtly the  push).<br/>
 <br/>
Keep it general and happy and busy!<br/>
