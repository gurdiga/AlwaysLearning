The Handwringers Column <br/>

Dear Handwringers, <br/>
<br/>
Next fall, my eldest child will be old enough for kindergarten, so the <br/>
pressure&#39;s on. The unschooling philosophy suits us - but I am becoming a <br/>
little freaked by happenings in the news which indicate it&#39;s becoming more <br/>
difficult for homeschoolers to earn &quot;diplomas and other credentials&quot; (see <br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t Let Credentials Get You Down&quot;, Mar.-April &#39;98, Home Education <br/>
Magazine). We&#39;ve chosen homeschooling for the greater opportunity and <br/>
enrichment it will allow our children. So any resulting impediment to their <br/>
future life (i.e. COLLEGE) is a big worry. My question is: Do you think a <br/>
prepackaged, accredited curriculum could serve as a tool used to dispel any <br/>
administrator&#39;s concern for the quality of our children&#39;s homeschooling <br/>
education? Or should I go ahead and spend all that extra cash we have laying <br/>
around on baby chicks or more books from the F.U.N. catalog? <br/>
<br/>
Dana Murguia <br/>
<br/>
Dear Dana, <br/>
<br/>
Your child is just approaching the compulsory sentence and already you hear <br/>
scary music on the soundtrack of your life? Is your career goal to be a <br/>
bonafide handwringer? (Motto: &quot;Worry now, and beat the rush.&quot;) <br/>
As you make your way through the maze of life you are going to read all kinds <br/>
of newsy things designed to send you into a tizzy of frivolous consuming. One <br/>
day you will read that homeschoolers have a tough time getting into college <br/>
then the next day (same newspaper, same section, same page, same ad for your <br/>
local tutoring center) you&#39;ll read another article that extols the ease with <br/>
which homeschoolers get into college and how administrators are going door to <br/>
door looking for homeschoolers who, as other articles will tell you and we <br/>
all know, are self-starters, self-directed, self-esteemed, self-dressing, <br/>
self-taught, self-motivated, self-defrosting and self-employed. Do these <br/>
homeschoolers even NEED college??? Then, on the same day you might come <br/>
across another article saying that scientists were wrong and the asteroid <br/>
they said couldn&#39;t possibly even come near our galaxy is headed smack dab for <br/>
the middle of California. See how quickly our center of gravity shifts? What <br/>
we are suggesting is–don&#39;t let the opinions of others determine how you want <br/>
your life and your kid&#39;s life to be. Would you prefer baby chicks pecking in <br/>
your bathtub next week or more paper stacked on your kitchen table? You <br/>
decide. Remember life is a mysterious process, fraught with twists and turns <br/>
no matter how well we prepare. <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t give up worrying however. I personally believe that worrying makes life <br/>
much more interesting than it really is. Worry is the Gymboree of the adult <br/>
mind. Philosophic musing, spiritual contemplation, abstract reasoning–all <br/>
that just floats on through, but worry, anxiety and panic, well that&#39;s <br/>
exciting stuff. Worry isn&#39;t a big problem if it only leads to impulse buying <br/>
at the educational toy store. The problem comes if you take yourself too <br/>
seriously and start imposing your panic on others. Forget it. Most children <br/>
succeed in life in spite of their parents&#39; ability or inability to worry. <br/>
<br/>
Dana, please don&#39;t think that we handwringers are not taking your concern <br/>
seriously. (We aren&#39;t, but don&#39;t think that). We handwringers believe in the <br/>
credo &quot;whatever works,&quot; shortened on alternate days to &quot;whatever.&quot; We admit <br/>
to being committed unschoolers, we believe unschooling is a valid educational <br/>
and lifestyle choice that we embrace from a generally prone position. We <br/>
wouldn&#39;t for a minute try to discourage you from buying a curriculum <br/>
advertised in your favorite homeschooling magazine but we do have a few words <br/>
of caution . . . <br/>
I once paid about $275 for a curriculum that would have cost me about $57.95 <br/>
if I had just gone out and bought the books myself but I was too smart to go <br/>
out and buy a bunch of books I knew would just sit on the shelf collecting <br/>
dust! When the curriculum arrived I thought, &quot;Gee, do I need to pay $275 so I <br/>
can say my kid is 5th grade material?&quot; No, I decided I didn&#39;t need to pay <br/>
$275 to achieve this; I could just practice saying it in the bathroom mirror <br/>
a few times and send the curriculum back. Luckily the curriculum came with a <br/>
money back guarantee and that money came in handy the next time we had to pay <br/>
some one to take some chickens off our hands. So don&#39;t give yourself one more <br/>
thing to worry about Dana: Make sure you get a money back guarantee, postage <br/>
included! <br/>
<br/>
Good luck, The Handwringers <br/>

worriers dare to tread. Be brave, challenge them and send them something to <br/>
worry about. Send all questions and worries to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:handwringers@...">handwringers@...</a><br/>
