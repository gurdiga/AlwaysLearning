<div id="ygrps-yiv-582172859">&lt;&lt;Then a few hours later I remembered suddenly how I used to glue  wall paper <br/>
samples as <br/>
covers on the dictionaries I used as textbooks when I  taught Jr. High. &gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
When Sam did his two-week stint at Jr. High, his English teacher told the  <br/>
class they couldn&#39;t use paper bags to cover their books because &quot;they&#39;re not  <br/>
pretty.&quot;  I wonder if your wallpaper samples would&#39;ve been passable.   She said <br/>
they had to buy those lycra ones.  <br/>
 <br/>
When he did his one-year stint in 5th grade, we did use a paper bag, and it  <br/>
was from his favorite skate shop, so according to him, it was by far the <br/>
coolest  bookcover in the class.  And it was the *only* one that wasn&#39;t  <br/>
store-bought.  The teacher remarked that she used to cover her books that  way, and she <br/>
hadn&#39;t seen one done like that in a long time.  (I think  *she* thought it was <br/>
pretty.)<br/>
 <br/>
He did end up getting one of the lycra ones at his 5th grade auction, and  it <br/>
had skateboarders on it too, but he chose to wear it around for weeks as a  <br/>
hat.  <br/>

I bought my kids a couple of these when we were doing the annual school<br/>
supply trip (we go to the Scholastic Warehouse Book Sale and then we got to<br/>
the Sprawl Mart and get some supplies) for some really nice reference type<br/>
books we bought.  My 5 year old did the same thing-wore it as a hat- with<br/>
the camouflage one we picked out for him, LOL!  Turns out they didn&#39;t fit<br/>
the books we bought them for, anyway, so I guess they were better as hats.<br/>
Glad they were only 64 cents!  =)<br/>
