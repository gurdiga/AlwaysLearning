<div id="ygrps-yiv-170698579"><div>Hi, I&#39;m trying to find a topic from a good while ago (I&#39;ve tried the search function but can&#39;t find it). There was a reply from a parent whose daughter had always worried about doing anything &#39;wrong&#39; and how they&#39;d helped her overcome that. Could anyone point me in the right direction, please?</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks,</div><div><br></div><div>Tam<br></div><p><span><br class="ygrps-yiv-170698579yui-cursor"></span></p></div>
