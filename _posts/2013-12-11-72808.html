<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A good test of the truth of &quot;Kids need ...&quot; statements is to replace &quot;kids&quot; with &quot;people.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;People need structure.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Is it true? Some people *like* structure. Some people don&#39;t. Some people like others to impose structure on them probably because they were never given the support to find their own ways of structuring their days. Or they&#39;ve, for whatever reason, equated structure (predictability) with security.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; parents supervising young children (under age 5) at birthday parties as an example of structure.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, yeah, the sentence will make more sense if the meaning of structure is twisted.<br/>
<br/>
(Foreign) people who don&#39;t know the rules of a society do appreciate having a &quot;spotter&quot; to catch them before they fall on their faces ;-) Children are like foreigners -- who sometimes don&#39;t realize they&#39;re foreigners! ;-) They don&#39;t know how to -- and sometimes can&#39;t -- be as kind, respectful, polite as a situation needs. Sometimes it&#39;s a matter of not knowing how. Sometimes it&#39;s being overwhelmed with emotions. Sometimes it&#39;s a matter of not being mature enough to make the kindest choices. A social situation is much pleasanter for everyone if mom can be her child&#39;s spotter.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a big chunk of the mentoring relationship between parent and child that doesn&#39;t have counterpart ideas that people already understand. So people resort to words that only sort of work, like calling support structure.<br/>
<br/>
Being a child&#39;s partner is one way of looking at the relationship. But it can call up images of partners who are equal and support each other. Being a team captures part of it. But a team generally implies all members on it have the same goal. Being a mentor captures part but misses how much the parent is in charge but giving thoughtful freedom to explore.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1693162576">Security.  They need to know that they are safe, and that there will be food, and a warm place to sleep, and people to answer their questions.  They need the structure of a home and family.  <br/>
<br/>
The kids who suffer with a lack of structure are the kids who have no idea what to expect when, and are always on the alert, biochemically, for danger or fear.  Kids with parents who aren&#39;t reliable about getting home, or picking the kids up on time, or having food in the house, or being kind and supportive—those kids need some more structure, surely.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1938469951"><div dir="ltr"><div class="ygrps-yiv-1938469951gmail_extra">Scaffolding has been one of my own personal mental images throughout our unschooling years. An aspect of the image that I like is that scaffolding is built to suit the situation. And I also like that it is clear that the person building the scaffolding is not the person who is really doing the actual work (learning). That&#39;s quite different than school teaching, where it is so commonly assumed that teaching creates the learning.<br>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-322152446"><div dir="ltr"><div><div>I can relate this to my son who has HFA and other co-conditions.  So many people have recommended visual timetables and structure. While he was in the acutely stressful environment of school I think it might have helped (if they had ever bothered to implement it correctly), and for us at home it did seem to help during that time.  For a time once we were out of school we still used it, and structured our days to avoid anxiety, but the need reduced although my son sometimes would ask for a daily schedule, or organise one himself from our resources.<br>
<br></div>Now that so much of the anxiety has gone, so has the need for structure.  Yes he still needs reassurance sometimes about what we are doing, and we are always clear on explaining activities when they are planned in advance, but the need for structure has gone, we can be spontaneous for known activities, we can change plans at the last minute.<br>
<br></div><div>Life by it&#39;s nature is not structured the the way we now recognise it.  In the past our structure was more fluid with changing seasons, not fixed minute by minute but changeable by forces such as weather.<br>
