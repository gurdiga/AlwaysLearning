On my state list someone posted that they are going to see the &quot;Blue<br/>
Men.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She stated that this was &quot;clearly...not educational.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So - those who are familiar with the Blue Men - want to chime in on<br/>
how seeing the Blue Men IS educational?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing she hasn&#39;t been yet, right? Ask her again *after* she&#39;s <br/>
been!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been twice. The first time was just after the Peabody conference <br/>
in Boston at one of their home theatres and just recently here in <br/>
Columbia at a much larger venue.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine how anyone could find it NOT educational!<br/>
<br/>
Besides, since when is *any* performance not educational?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this show (if they can handle the light show and extreme sound <br/>
levels (this show is NOT for the &quot;highly sensitive!!!)) is FULL of <br/>
smart, clever puns and other fantastic word play and quick, brilliant <br/>
musical jokes---not to mention---hell, just plain SMART! It&#39;lll keep <br/>
you thinking about so many subjects and questioning things you&#39;d never <br/>
imagine. It&#39;s very current---and can change nightly if the world&#39;s <br/>
events would improve the show.<br/>
<br/>
Current events<br/>
Word play<br/>
Music play<br/>
Human interaction (they often use audience members)<br/>
Social commentary<br/>
Architecture/Set Desin (depending on the venue)<br/>
Art<br/>
Light show<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t remember all the cool things they did---and each show we saw <br/>
was sooo different from the other!<br/>
<br/>
This is a BRILLIANT work of art!<br/>
<br/>
Go, if you can!<br/>
