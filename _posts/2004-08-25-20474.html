<div id="ygrps-yiv-1670811600">I don&#39;t know who first used the phrase, this list has been a flurry of<br/>
activity the last few days, but someone described &quot;unschooling&quot; as &quot;living<br/>

hoping to enlist all of you to help me with a list of all the things that<br/>
would be true in our lives if school did not exist.<br/>
<br/>
If SCHOOL did not exist:<br/>
<br/>
-children would not be judged as succeeding (or not) against an arbitrary<br/>
scale of academic milestones<br/>
-family attractions would be open year-round<br/>
-the minimum work age would be lower<br/>
-we would interact with people of all ages all the time<br/>
<br/>
These are just a few to get us started, please add to the list, rephrase,<br/>
brainstorm.<br/>
<br/>
I am having a hard time accepting my &quot;Certificate of Empowerment&quot; from<br/>
Sandra, especially paragraph one.  I want to hear everyone&#39;s ideas about<br/>
what the world really would be like if school did not exist.<br/>

No I didn&#39;t mean it in that way, I meant I am having a hard time accepting<br/>
my empowerment!  In other words I do still care what other people think, I<br/>
occasionally fall into the trap of &quot;experts&quot; and I am just having a hard<br/>
time removing my brain from the status quo.<br/>

<br/>
So what you are actually asking for is a description of our daily lives? ;)<br/>
Maybe it is more like &quot;living as though school did not exist *for us*&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I try not to do school conversations myself. Talking about the negatives of<br/>
school keeps it coming back to the forefront of my mind, where I don&#39;t want<br/>
it. It slows my journey towards removing schoolthink from my internal<br/>
dialogue. That&#39;s just me.<br/>
<br/>
Anything I wrote about school not existing would be talking about how it<br/>
affects other people who are still involved in it. Not every result would be<br/>
positive - children at home with parents who didn&#39;t necessarily want them<br/>
around, my neighbors kids over here a lot more often.<br/>

pursue interests, it seems ideal for kids.<br/>
<br/>
But from a poverty class position where kids could be seen as another source<br/>
of income, it&#39;s not ideal for the kids.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with Robyn. There&#39;s a difference between living as though school<br/>
didn&#39;t exist and living in a world where school doesn&#39;t exist. When I think<br/>
of a world without school, visions of Dickensian London come to mind.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-838640827">Sometimes, when I&#39;m considering a parenting or<br/>
education situation, I imagine I am on a desert island<br/>
and there are no people to judge me.  How do I live<br/>
when no one is watching?  Of course, in my<br/>
imagination, I am living totally in the moment.<br/>
<br/>
On a morbid note (that&#39;s a little hard to admit),<br/>
sometimes I think, &quot;How would I respond if I knew one<br/>
of us was going to die tomorrow?&quot;  The amount of<br/>
donuts or the rules of bedtime or doing math or<br/>

treated everyone like it was their birthday everyday. <br/>
(Of course, this would mean we were being treated<br/>
likewise...so there wouldn&#39;t be too much exhaustion.)<br/>

stressful situations.<br/>

<br/>
Right.  Don&#39;t live in the shadow of school.  Don&#39;t live with school in your <br/>
peripheral vision.  <br/>
<br/>
It takes a while, but the best tool I know of is to begin to eliminate <br/>
school-terms from your own vocabulary, and after that eliminate them from your <br/>
regular thoughts.   Things that are school-specific, like grades, semesters, <br/>
midterms, recess, demerits, credits, schoolday/schoolnight...   you don&#39;t need the <br/>
shadowy framework of those things on your life.<br/>

That is beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
It helps even if you&#39;re considering that you&#39;ll see them again tomorrow. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Holly told me the other day that I had to be extra nice to her this week, <br/>
because then she would go to the conference and talk to people.  (Or some other <br/>
eye-batting, cute little blackmail attempt, which I must say is fine with me in <br/>
such cases. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
But really, the nicer I am to my kids the nicer they are to me, and then it&#39;s <br/>
easy to be nice to them...   Works with husbands too. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
I think what we have, that was undreamed of in Victorian London, is the internet, computers, distance-learning, and educational software.  If people wanted to learn things that they couldn&#39;t learn my trial and error or from friends and mentors, we have computer-tutoring or self-paced computer learning stuff as an alternative.  (If it can be made available cheaply.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen the library&#39;s computers get heavy usage from job-hunting results during the recession.  If we assume that people, even those under 18 can also be this highly motivated, we can imagine a library with lots more terminals as part of our future school-less learning system.<br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;m imagining that people won&#39;t have to be &quot;ignorant&quot; or choose &quot;pickpocket&quot; as a career path.  But it&#39;s true that if children aren&#39;t warehoused, there will be more of them on the street or out and about in the community.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think this is morbid at all. I do this also, especially if I am<br/>
having a grump day. It&#39;s a great technique for getting back perspective and<br/>
an infusion of gratitude. Along similar lines: &quot;How important will this<br/>
issue be in 10 (or 1) years time?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Other times I like to pretend it is everybody&#39;s<br/>
birthday.  Think how wonderful things could be if we<br/>
treated everyone like it was their birthday everyday. <br/>
(Of course, this would mean we were being treated<br/>

<br/>
Sounds like fun. Jayn often pretends it is her imaginary friend, Googly&#39;s,<br/>
birthday over and over. I sometimes say, &quot;Again? Wow she has lots of<br/>
birthdays&quot;. I&#39;m told Googly is from another planet where they have lots of<br/>
birthdays and you can grow older or younger at will.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;So....if I lived in the moment everyday (as if school<br/>
didn&#39;t exist), I would concentrate on loving those<br/>
around me deeply all the time, particularly in<br/>
stressful situations&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Lovely! Let&#39;s none of us wait for school to disappear to do just that!<br/>
