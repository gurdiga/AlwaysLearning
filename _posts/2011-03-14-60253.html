<div id="ygrps-yiv-305778266">That&#39;s a hard one. I can only share with you what my parents did (who brought in 11 teenage foster-girls - I was the only biological) and what I do with my step-kids (15 and 13)  and bio 13 year old daughter. <br/>
<br/>
One of things I remember most which my Mom did was be there when I needed her. I was a very mouthy/bratty teen (we are best friends now, btw). Whenever I was up late studying or anxious and couldn&#39;t sleep, she&#39;d make me a glass of warm milk, bring it to me silently and leave a little encouraging note-an I love or or I believe in you, whatever. Knowing she was there was like having a strong bedrock beneath me. Sometimes, she&#39;d stay up with me all night then give me a free pass to go in or not go in the next day while she went to work. <br/>
<br/>
Although I was angry (part of he age) I knew she was there. I now do this with my teens and finds it works. I realize that costumes (hair, makeup, etc_ are just that. If they won&#39;t matter when she&#39;s 5 yrs older I don&#39;t say anything. My sd likes to wear really short skirts (bum showing). She&#39;s in the top clique-cheerleader. Our compromise was cheer spanks underneath. She&#39;s going to either wear it with my support or feel like she&#39;s going against us and in that moment feel she won but consequently feel we don&#39;t support her. <br/>
<br/>
Hang in there. Judge less, love more. &quot;Date&quot; her-cards, I love you/thinking of you gifts under her door, a gentle I&#39;m here for you timed right. She&#39;s searching for herself away from you. It&#39;s like when they were learning how to walk-they&#39;d stagger away, hang onto something, walk away, look back and maybe even yell at you if you started to come toward her to pick her up. Let her walk and be there to pick her up, without judgement, when she falls. <br/>
<br/>
My father gave me the following advice for dealing with 12 teenage daughters: be deaf/dumb/blind as long as it won&#39;t kill them. That way, you both survive. :)<br/>
<br/>
It works for us with 2 in public school, 2 homeschooled (10th, 2 in 7th 1 in preschool). <br/>
<br/>
Good luck!!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-431509928">Why would anyone want to share their life and their interests with someone who <br/>
doesn&#39;t find any value in them? Maybe you can start by assuming that anything <br/>
she values must be valuable. Maybe you can see something as being imbued with <br/>
value just by her interest in it. I&#39;ve done that a fair bit with Simon and <br/>
Linnaea.  When you see her pick out an outfit you wouldn&#39;t choose, watch her <br/>
face, watch her joy. Think about things that you value that others may have <br/>
disliked and how much pleasure your own choices has given you. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Your daughter values school and social time and her relationships with her <br/>
friends. Those things have absolute value as well as personal value. She values <br/>
aesthetics in fashion. She likes the raiments of a more popular culture than <br/>
maybe you do. Those are all things that can be understood without too much <br/>
effort. Look for the smaller pieces you enjoy in each of her choices that you <br/>
might not make personally. Maybe just enjoy the fact that her life is not a <br/>
carbon copy of your own. She is embracing different aspects of the world than <br/>
you chose to, that&#39;s pretty cool. And a lot of the things that you are <br/>
dismissing as fads, like appearance, have been important for humans, among other <br/>
species, for a very, very long time. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>**************<br/>
<br/>
Wanting her to have different interests is like wanting her to be another person - not a great basis for a relationship. If you want to embrace her and her world, you&#39;ll need to move past that and develop an appreciation of what she sees and loves. Not that you&#39;ll have to love those things, necessarily, but go beyond tolerating them to seeing what she finds marvelous. <br/>
<br/>
My daughter loves physical comedy. I don&#39;t, but I&#39;ve done a bit of research into what makes physical comedy &quot;work&quot; and have come to appreciate when its done skillfully, either by live performers or in animation. <br/>
<br/>
My stepson loves death metal (music). I can barely hear it - I mean the way its usually played sounds like static to me. But I&#39;ve found some northern European bands who play popular heavy metal as classical pieces so that I could actually hear and apprecite the music, then found a related genre (epic folk metal - think Lord of the Rings with electric guitars) which is &quot;musical&quot; enough for me and &quot;heavy&quot; enough for him. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;constantly texting and talking on the phone with her friends<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do you text? That could be a place to start connecting more. It may seem counter-intuitive, but younger people have a different approach to technology than older generations and see it more as a tool for connection. Don&#39;t disparage that (things ain&#39;t what they used to be!) use it to reach out. <br/>

<br/>
My oldest just turned 17. We share some common interests, but she enjoys a lot of things that I do not. So, I keep looking for common ground and a way to support/be involved with whatever it is. As others have said, I try to focus on her joy, not my opinion of whatever it is.<br/>
<br/>
Specific examples:<br/>
<br/>
I follow some of her favorite bands on twitter so I know when new albums are coming out and other news. <br/>
<br/>
By observing the types of clothes she picks out for herself I have gotten pretty good at choosing/suggesting things (shirts and accessories/makeup/nail polish) that go with her style.<br/>
<br/>
I look for deals and coupons that she might be interested in and we go shopping together for makeup/hair dye (even though I don&#39;t use either). <br/>
<br/>
When she needs clothes, I make it a point to leave her siblings at home so that I can focus on her and so she doesn&#39;t feel rushed while shopping. <br/>
<br/>
I support her art in whatever way I can (supplies, scanning, printing, framing, etc). <br/>
<br/>
I reply to some of her tweets/facebook posts and email her links that she might like.<br/>
<br/>
I learned some quotes from her favorite movies and try to use them when appropriate. She&#39;s better at it than I am, but I&#39;m learning :)<br/>
<br/>
I cook food that she likes. If she suggests something specific, I try to make it as soon as I have all of the ingredients to do so. <br/>

<br/>
This is an interesting question.  <br/>
The crux of it is the &quot;it&quot; in &quot;find a way to make it work.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If &quot;it&quot; is unschooling, it can&#39;t be made to work if she&#39;s happily ensconced in school.  Nor should it!  If she&#39;s liking where she is and isn&#39;t having trouble, then that&#39;s her priority and probably should be!<br/>
<br/>
-=-any ideas on how i can woo her back (she does not want to quit school)? do i immerse myself in her world to the extent she&#39;ll let me and build up our relationship?-=-<br/>
<br/>
The popular clique at school won&#39;t want you in it.<br/>
<br/>
-=- i can see myself finding joy in sharing interests with her, and i want to embrace her and her world, but if i am totally honest i find myself wanting her to have different interests. i don&#39;t value many of the things she likes, like current fashion trends, her taste in music or TV shows, her interest in makeup, hair and appearances and whatever else is popular right now... (gah, i feel like such an old fart!) which i of course realize is unaccepting and therefore disconnecting. i can see that i am judgmental, so i am sure she senses that too. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Given a choice between people who accept and appreciate you and  text you and talk to you on the phone every day, and someone who doesn&#39;t like your makeup, hair, fashions, music and favorite TV shows.... which would ANYONE choose?  <br/>
<br/>
-=-i want to prioritize my relationship with her so we can connect and hopefully stay close as she enters her later teens and adulthood, but i don&#39;t know exactly how to find common ground. how do i get past my disdain for some of those things that she is into, so i can connect with her on her terms? -=-<br/>
<br/>
The best thoughts I have are partly dependent on a couple of issues:  Can your family afford a vacation?  and how does she get along with her step-dad?<br/>
<br/>
If the other children are older (old enough to be left at home with dad), maybe you and your oldest daughter could go on a vacation.  If they&#39;re still little, maybe you and your daughter could plan a family vacation.  Let her to a lot of the planning and decisionmaking.  Let her be a star, rather than a childcare assistant.  Being away from the house and away from the school might give you some time to create new shared memories.  It wouldn&#39;t be a magical turning point, but it would be a big step toward having a relationship with her.    Don&#39;t criticize her while you&#39;re on vacation if she wants to listen to her own music sometimes, or dress as she wants to, or text her friends, though.  If your plan is to isolate her, she might not even want to go.<br/>
<br/>
Another idea I have is maybe to tell her, either on a long car ride where it&#39;s just the two of you, or in writing, maybe, that you wish your relationship could have been different, that you wish you knew then what you know now, or whatever it is you wish.  She might not respond immediately, but the ideas and the sentiments will be inside her, for her to process when and as she can.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-767623024">Consider that the negativity you feel about your daughter&#39;s tastes is<br/>
yours, not at all hers, and that the negativity doesn&#39;t have to do<br/>
with any of the choices your daughter makes. The negativity is inside<br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes negativity is based on worrying about safety, etc. and often<br/>
it&#39;s just plain old negative jibes. Parenting with personal little<br/>
packets of negativity in key areas might make it so that when<br/>
something is dangerous, your subtle negative background &quot;noise&quot; drowns<br/>
out stronger signals of concern. And on the basis that you aren&#39;t<br/>
hearing your daughter, she won&#39;t hear you.<br/>
<br/>
Surprise yourself! Until having a son who is into games, I considered<br/>
myself a &quot;book&quot; person not a gamer type. Karl talks a lot about<br/>
Minecraft and also other games. A new addition is Magicka. I don&#39;t<br/>
keep up with every last thing but I know a lot more than I would if I<br/>
left him to his own devices. At first, I didn&#39;t care for Minecraft<br/>
much but very quickly I found a lot to like and I play it too.<br/>
<br/>
And I have branched out into connecting with other children in<br/>
extended family. I just talked on the phone yesterday with a 15 year<br/>
old homeschooled nephew who told me about greyhounds, how they&#39;re<br/>
raised and treated in order to make them racers, their particular<br/>
strengths and fragilities. And we talked about a lot of other things<br/>
too. And I was the &quot;cat&quot; person, I thought, with lots of negative<br/>
experience with dogs. Surprise, again.<br/>
<br/>
I feel that I&#39;m a much different person from the one I used to be. I<br/>
hope I feel like that every year.<br/>
<br/>
There are things I love that few people I know have much interest for.<br/>
I can still enjoy them but it&#39;s nice to be able to talk a bit about<br/>
them to people whose interest it isn&#39;t, who are just interested in me.<br/>
If someone can&#39;t ever sustain much conversation about something I like<br/>
that they aren&#39;t into, I might sometimes wonder if it&#39;s ME they don&#39;t<br/>
like.<br/>
<br/>
You hop a ride on &quot;fads&quot; and passing &quot;fancies&quot; while they lead the way<br/>
to your daughter. And if her interests are temporary and you also lose<br/>
touch with her, then how will you know where to even begin? My folks<br/>
will probably NEVER know. That one little thing has been very hard for<br/>
me at times. Another thing I&#39;m not passing down to Karl.<br/>
<br/>
And in your case, you have others standing by to share those interests<br/>
with your daughter. That&#39;s a help if you really CAN&#39;T get much into<br/>
what she&#39;s into. But nobody else can replace her mom or determine the<br/>
quality of your connection being made now. Facilitate her interests.<br/>
<br/>
This is normal development during the teen years, to make decisions of<br/>
one&#39;s own and to step outside of parental spheres of influence and try<br/>
things out. And if it is still ok and doesn&#39;t rock the relationship,<br/>
it will a) not automatically offend people she&#39;s close to or have them<br/>
one-upping her by taking decisions from her and thus b) it will<br/>
probably be less traumatic if there actually are consequences to deal<br/>
with. Realize that such outcomes are choices not forgone conclusions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1805104338">I also wondered if the twelve daughters were teens simultaneously, in<br/>
which case they would very likely lack for attention which they would<br/>
crave from parents at any age. I&#39;m thinking the ages were more spread<br/>
out than that though.<br/>
<br/>
And I don&#39;t think playing ignorant is even a sound idea for survival.<br/>
Preferably unschooling is much more than just surviving. A parent who<br/>
wants to raise a schoolchild with unschooly leanings would want to be<br/>
aware and to let it show sometimes. If the parents are busy ignoring<br/>
stuff, the thought for the child might be to go around ignoring stuff<br/>
rather than alive to what&#39;s going on and actively involved in making<br/>
good decisions for themselves.<br/>

Holt says in &quot;Escape From Childhood&quot;:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;...one reason why teenagers seem to be so preoccupied with such things [he had just mentioned their personal, emotional, and social lives] is that we do not allow them to be preoccupied with much of anything else.&quot;  p.160 <br/>
<br/>
------------------<br/>
<br/>
Peer oriented kids seem to go to school more to socialize than to learn. They can lose a lot of their individuality, their creativity and curiosity trying to fit in with their group. Sadly, maybe they  have already lost their love of learning. <br/>
<br/>
Parents might want to check their own behaviours. Are children clear on what their parents&#39; values are? Are parents saying one thing and living another? Do the parents live/value the same peer oriented behaviours that they are criticizing in their own children? Are they buying things and doing things to keep up with &quot;the Joneses&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe parents who want to reconnect with their teens could find something to do that is part of the larger world, like volunteering at an animal shelter (animals!) or food bank or kitchen (cooking!), or collecting items for teen shelters (clothes!).<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s a false dichotomy - people can and do learn from other people. It might be more accurate to say that people with a lot of interpersonal intelligence learn more from social interactions at school than they do from the curriculum. <br/>
<br/>
It may be helpful for a parent who is wondering how to connect with a very social teen to look for ways to be more social with her - not just look for ways to socialize but work on communicating in a way that&#39;s more sociable. Parents can easily fall into a pattern where virtually all their interactions with their kids are a kind of teaching - even chit chat has imbedded lessons about this or that. Part of deschooling for parents is moving away from that kind of relationship and learning how to act like a friend. That&#39;s important with any kid, but all the more so with a kid who is very tuned in to social nuances.   <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; They can lose a lot of their individuality, their creativity and curiosity trying to fit in with their group.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>****************<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re less likely to do that if they aren&#39;t stuck with just one group. School tends to pigeon hole kids into smaller groups, but parents can contribute to that, too. Putting down a young person&#39;s interests most often leads to that person clinging to his or her interests all the harder - and *that* does more to lock a young person in to one group than being a member of the group. <br/>

<br/>
Adults also frame those kinds of interests in very negative way for teens, but frame those same interests in a positive light for adults. Its *noble* for adults to be concerned with issues of social justice, emotional and personal well-being, but when a teen is exploring those issues in the real (if narrow) world of school, its all just trivia. <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling kids have the advantage of a wider world in which to explore big ideas about society and personal growth and - hopefully! - parents who are being supportive of those interests.  <br/>

<br/>
Do you mean suggest sharing those things with their teens or go off and &quot;set a good example&quot;? That&#39;s not clear. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s good for parents to flip that idea around and see that seemingly small interests can and do tie in to the larger world and trust that your teen isn&#39;t oblivious to those connections, even if she&#39;s (or he&#39;s) not sharing those insights with you just now. <br/>

clothes designs, makeup, decor, decorum, and all kinds of other<br/>
cosmetics for all kinds of looks.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, it seems to me that the awareness of an interest one<br/>
doesn&#39;t share might sometimes be overshadowed with bafflement about<br/>
why the interest exists. Which is good reason to respect your<br/>
children&#39;s interests *especially* if you don&#39;t share them.<br/>

When Kirby started driving himself, I really missed the times I drove him to karate, hung out for an hour, and brought him home.   We knew each other more because of those drives in those years than anything else.<br/>

Be the Mom who makes things possible. My always-unschooled daughter went to high school in 10th grade and now she&#39;s in 11th. Be willing to drive a carload of kids whenever there&#39;s an event. You can bring a book and hang out unobtrusively, or find somewhere nearby to get coffee, or even go home and go back to pick them all up if another parent won&#39;t share the driving. <br/>
<br/>
My daughter has been amazed at how few parents will drive and facilitate their kids&#39; participation in events. Sometimes, there are events at school and kids are dropped off with no idea of how they&#39;ll get home! We have a standing agreement with our daughter that she can offer anyone a ride home, doesn&#39;t even need to call and ask. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-521514642">***My daughter has been amazed at how few parents will drive and facilitate <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not a new phenomenon!  I&#39;ve been amazed how many parents just simply won&#39;t <br/>
drive their kids anywhere.  I was telling my mother about it and she said that <br/>
was the case when we were young too.  I always remember my mom driving us <br/>
places, picking up other kids and dropping them back home.  I never really <br/>
thought about it, it just was the way it was.  <br/>
<br/>
I had a conversation with a mom about driving her son home.  She seemed to think <br/>
it was this great big deal.  I told her that driving to and from friend&#39;s houses <br/>
was part of our homeschooling costs, that it needed to be since her peer group <br/>
isn&#39;t built around the neighborhood school, but that it&#39;s super nice when other <br/>
parents share the driving.   It still is a big deal to her even though she <br/>
drives herself to the mall right by our house to go shopping.  She is like so <br/>
many other parents of teens, she has this built in idea that teens are somehow <br/>
less deserving of rides, or somehow capable of getting themselves to and fro <br/>
even without public transportation or cars or driver&#39;s licenses.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s odd, but very very normal.  I&#39;ve had to pleasure to get to know all these <br/>
wonderful kids by simply driving, or being available to drive.  I get to hear <br/>
new music and learn about what goes on at schools and other people&#39;s homes. <br/>
 It&#39;s fascinating!<br/>
