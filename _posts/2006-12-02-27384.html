<div id="ygrps-yiv-1979733831">I just wrote this to someone who&#39;s not an unschooler at all  <br/>
(unmarried man 30ish, SCA friend, going through a break-up and  <br/>
therapy, and coming to a philosophy discussion series I&#39;m running).   <br/>
First quote is his:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-There&#39;s been some<br/>
interesting parallels in the discussions on Wed and when I<br/>
talk with Bob.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s because everything&#39;s connected.<br/>
<br/>
And people can either be still inside, where nothing sticks (kind of  <br/>
like ice, just being there, all frozen up), or can be alertly swirly,  <br/>
like simmering water.  When your thoughts are swirling, it seems like  <br/>
everything connects to something.  You&#39;re intellectually and  <br/>
emotionally in motion.<br/>
