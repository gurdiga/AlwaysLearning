<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; . If anyone knows of any short articles about unschooling that<br/>
&gt; may be helpful, I could probably get him to read something short. Just not<br/>
&gt; an entire book. :-) Also, if anyone knows any unschoolers in the Clovis, NM<br/>
&gt; area or the Columbus, MS area, perhaps I could get in touch with them.  We<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t have much time left in Clovis, so the Columbus area would be more<br/>
&gt; helpful.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d try the www.unschooling.com site---bunches of wonderful, short essays on <br/>
unschooling (many written by some of THESE very people talking with you now!&lt;<br/>
G&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
As for unschooling conferences, I&#39;m hosting one in Columbia, South Carolina, <br/>
11-13 October 2002. Please try to come---and bring your husband! It&#39;s <br/>
Columbus Day weekend, so you&#39;ll have time to travel back home on Monday. Many <br/>
of these posters will be there, either as speakers or as attendees. We&#39;re <br/>
even having a Father&#39;s Roundtable, so he can opening discuss his fears with <br/>
other DADS who&#39;ve been there, done that. Access the site at <br/>
www.schoolsoutsupport.org   No age discrimination either, so bring the kids!<br/>

&lt;&lt;    Thanks for the reply. Dh isn&#39;t a group kinda person and his business is<br/>
 really hoppin&#39; that time of year. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Although our business is dieing down that time of year, my dh is also not a <br/>
big group person. Being an introvert it drains him. Plus, he&#39;s not a big <br/>
advocate for unschooling as of yet....homeschooling yes. Unschooling he&#39;s <br/>
still not sure, he just goes along with me because he knows how passionate I <br/>
am.<br/>
He&#39;s very &quot;outside the box&quot; in a lot of ways though, so I&#39;m not giving up <br/>
just yet!!! LOL<br/>

&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; And ds would put in a vote for anything skateboarding or roller <br/>
blading. &gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
 The hotel might not like it a bit, but I&#39;ll remind marty to bring blades.<br/>

park. Roller blading is big in our house too. Trevor is wanting to join a new <br/>
skate park here with really amazing ramps and jumps.<br/>
