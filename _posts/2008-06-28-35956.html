love or wrestling with a wee one, you&#39;re communicating with someone <br/>
else, and communication *always* involves lots and lots of <br/>
learning.  You learn what your partner likes and/or doesn&#39;t like; you <br/>
learn how gentle you have to be, or not be.  You learn what *you* <br/>

<br/>
When I set up the cafe press store this afternoon for Learn Nothing  <br/>
Day, I hesitated on the young children&#39;s and baby clothes.  They  <br/>
learn all the time for sure.  But I though hey, nobody lets a toddler  <br/>
shoot off the fireworks, but they still get to watch.  So maybe a  <br/>
little kid could watch the older people try not to learn.  And  <br/>
there&#39;s a really pretty yellow color on the children&#39;s t-shirt.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I know I&#39;m still behind on<br/>
<br/>
--email,<br/>
<br/>
--adding translations to the Learn Nothing Day page<br/>
<br/>
--editing the &quot;how to screw it up&quot; list (or maybe I&#39;m caught up with  <br/>
that one).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But the art is all done:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.blogspot.com">http://sandradodd.blogspot.com</a><br/>
<br/>
and I&#39;m going to go and work on an annotation with links of what&#39;s in  <br/>
all those letters.  If any of you want to try to identify things  <br/>
there in the meantime, go for it!      I spent some of the afternoon  <br/>
making something for Pam Sorooshian who is on a train in Kansas (New  <br/>
Mexico by now, but many hours late) and I&#39;m going to meet them at the  <br/>
train station with hamburgers when they call and say they&#39;re near.   <br/>
I&#39;m very happy the art is finished and up, but I still have some  <br/>
things to do before just sitting back and waiting for the flawed  <br/>
countdown code I found to settle out. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
I can do that.  I can experience something physical as a memory of  <br/>
other times, and find the essence of a smell or a feeling and hang on  <br/>
it for a long time with a very still brain.  Maybe the first few  <br/>
times I did it I was learning, but some things can happen again, and  <br/>
it&#39;s just &quot;again&quot;--not in a bad way, but in a really good way.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes birds will hold themselves against a wind, so it seems  <br/>
they&#39;re just hanging in one place without moving their wings much.   <br/>
It&#39;s really pretty and I feel like I can do something like that, with  <br/>
thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
It never lasts too long.  Five or ten minutes.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t do it for a whole Learn Nothing Day.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
General anesthesia--that I could do.  Some people fear it but I  <br/>
always feel really great afterwards (and no pain during).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any such legal thing as elective general  <br/>
anesthesia.<br/>

&gt; -=-I may be a big ol&#39; party pooper on Learn Nothing Day &#39;cause, for the<br/>
&gt; life of me, I really don&#39;t know *how* I&#39;ll participate. Even sitting<br/>
&gt; and staring at a blank wall can be fraught with learning.-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh, well join the party! I mean... the party. . poopers.<br/>

Well if any of you hear any good criticism, please send it on! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If some of you would pass it on to other lists you&#39;re on, I&#39;d  <br/>
appreciate it!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe this link would be a good one.  It has a link to the Learn  <br/>
Nothing Day page:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com/">http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll put it on UnschoolingDiscussion, but that&#39;s the only other list  <br/>
I&#39;m on.   I have a list at LilaGuide, but it&#39;s more an attachment  <br/>
parenting for young moms list, and this isn&#39;t a good recommendation  <br/>
to make to people who aren&#39;t unschooling yet or don&#39;t even intend  <br/>
to.   Just as babies and nursing moms aren&#39;t expected to fast on  <br/>
religious holidays, neither should they fast on a learning holiday.   <br/>
Unlike the rest of us, they have accelerated learning needs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-23972793">Incidentally (while on the subject of translations) my translation spurred<br/>
some internal disagreement (as so many do) about the use of the double<br/>
negative in Spanish: Part of me still wants to call it &quot;El Dia de NO<br/>
Aprender Nada&quot;, as that sounds more natural, while my initially submitted<br/>
contribution was &quot;El Dia de Aprender Nada&quot; as a more literal &quot;Learn Nothing&quot;<br/>
day translation, which to me has some philosophical connotations (not just<br/>
that we would try NOT to learn that day, but that by &quot;learning nothing&quot; we<br/>
would be somehow &quot;learning about nothing&quot; if you will, which I realize is<br/>
contrary to the intent of the holiday :) but still struck me as meaningful<br/>
in context. So, my disclaimer is, for a purist, the transilation &quot;El Dia de<br/>
No Aprender Nada&quot; might be more appropriate.<br/>

&gt;   -=-Children can do it in an instant. Move think big, breathe, do<br/>
&gt; acrobates moves, singing and jumping all in a flash.<br/>
&gt; Electric bodies and minds but they also stay still. I see them do<br/>
&gt; stillness.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I d like to think that they don&#39;t need to learn as they just generate<br/>
&gt; wisdom<br/>
&gt; from within.-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When I set up the cafe press store this afternoon for Learn Nothing<br/>
&gt; Day, I hesitated on the young children&#39;s and baby clothes. They<br/>
&gt; learn all the time for sure. But I though hey, nobody lets a toddler<br/>
&gt; shoot off the fireworks, but they still get to watch. So maybe a<br/>
&gt; little kid could watch the older people try not to learn. And<br/>
&gt; there&#39;s a really pretty yellow color on the children&#39;s t-shirt.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know I&#39;m still behind on<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; --email,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; --adding translations to the Learn Nothing Day page<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; --editing the &quot;how to screw it up&quot; list (or maybe I&#39;m caught up with<br/>
&gt; that one).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But the art is all done:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.blogspot.com">http://sandradodd.blogspot.com</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; and I&#39;m going to go and work on an annotation with links of what&#39;s in<br/>
&gt; all those letters. If any of you want to try to identify things<br/>
&gt; there in the meantime, go for it! I spent some of the afternoon<br/>
&gt; making something for Pam Sorooshian who is on a train in Kansas (New<br/>
&gt; Mexico by now, but many hours late) and I&#39;m going to meet them at the<br/>
&gt; train station with hamburgers when they call and say they&#39;re near.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m very happy the art is finished and up, but I still have some<br/>
&gt; things to do before just sitting back and waiting for the flawed<br/>
&gt; countdown code I found to settle out. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is the crux of the problem, as I see it--learning is like a playful little imp that jumps out <br/>
at us from behind any corner, at any time.  Little do we know when, BAM!, we&#39;ve been hit with <br/>
learning!  How does one protect against the unseen, the unforseeable?  We could barricade <br/>
the doors, but then we might be hit from within.  We could go out, but no, that&#39;s way too <br/>
dangerous--the variables are mind blowing!<br/>
<br/>
This problem must be solved.  And then Sandra can publish a Learn Nothing Day manual, and <br/>
give complete instructions about how to properly celebrate the holiday.  I&#39;ll be anxiously <br/>
waiting to download my pdf version.<br/>
