The trip has been fun.  We&#39;ve done so much I can&#39;t even think about it.  I&#39;ll write more about it later.<br/>
<br/>
Dar, can you send me your address privately. <br/>
<br/>
Who is in Alb? again?  We&#39;ll be in town on Tuesday, maybe doing the zoo.... Bandalier is slated for tomorrow maybe.  Today we are simply relaxing and listening to the rain.<br/>

How about sending some up BC way.  One third of one of our cities has been<br/>
evacuated because of a huge forest fire.  They&#39;ve let some of them go home,<br/>
so I&#39;m guessing it went a different direction, but over 200 homes have been<br/>
lost.  My dh&#39;s niece and nephew live there, and some of their friends have<br/>
lost their homes.<br/>
