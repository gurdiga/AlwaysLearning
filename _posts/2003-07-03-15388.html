&gt;A picture began circulating in November. It should be &quot;The Picture of the Year,&quot; or perhaps, &quot;Picture of the Decade.&quot; It won&#39;t be. In fact, unless you obtained a copy of the US paper which published it, you probably will never see it. The picture is that of a 21-week-old unborn baby named Samuel Alexander Armas, who is being operated on by a surgeon named Joseph Bruner. The baby was diagnosed with spina bifida and would not survive if removed from his mother&#39;s womb. Little Samuel&#39;s mother, Julie Armas, is an obstetrics nurse in Atlanta. She knew of Dr. Bruner&#39;s remarkable surgical procedure. Practicing at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, he performs these special operations<br/>
&gt;while the baby is still in the womb. During the procedure, the doctor removes the uterus via C-section and makes a small incision to operate on the baby. As Dr. Bruner completed the surgery on little Samuel, the little guy reached his tiny, but fully developed, hand through the incision and firmly grasped the surgeon&#39;s finger.  In a Time Europe article highlighting new pregnancy imagery that show the formation of major organs and other significant evidence of the formation of human life but a few days after conception, Dr. Bruner was reported as saying that when his finger was grasped, it was the most emotional moment of his life, and that for an instant during the procedure he was just frozen, totally immobile. The photograph captures this amazing event with perfect clarity. The editors titled the picture, &quot;Hand of Hope.&quot; The text explaining the picture begins, &quot;The tiny hand of 21-week-old fetus Samuel<br/>
&gt;Alexander Armas emerges from the mother&#39;s uterus to grasp the finger of Dr. Joseph Bruner as if thanking the doctor for the gift of life.&quot; Little Samuel&#39;s mother said they &quot;wept for days&quot; when they saw the picture. She said, &quot;The photo reminds us my pregnancy isn&#39;t about disability or an illness, it&#39;s about a little person.&quot; Samuel was born in perfect health, the operation 100 per cent successful. Now see the actual picture, and it is awesome...incredible. And hey, pass it  on. The world needs to see this one!<br/>

  &gt; Don&#39;t believe every forward you read.  From the Urban Legends Reference<br/>
  &gt; Pages:<br/>
  &gt; &lt;A<br/>
  HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.snopes.com/photos/thehand.asp&quot;">http://www.snopes.com/photos/thehand.asp&quot;</a>&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.snopes.com/photos">http://www.snopes.com/photos</a><br/>
  /thehand.asp&lt;/A&gt;<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; What actually happened, as described in news reports of the surgery, was<br/>
  &gt; that:<br/>
  &gt; &gt; [J]ust as surgeon Dr. Joseph Bruner was closing the incision in Julie<br/>
  &gt; &gt; Armas&#39; uterus, Samuel&#39;s thumbnail-sized hand flopped out. Bruner lifted<br/>
  it gently<br/>
  &gt; &gt; and tucked it back in.2<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; Dr. Bruner later elaborated on some of the exaggerated and false claims<br/>
  made<br/>
  &gt; about this picture:<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &quot;It has become an urban legend,&quot; says Bruner, the Vanderbilt University<br/>
  &gt; &gt; surgeon who fixed the spina bifida lesion on Samuel. Many people he<br/>
  hears from<br/>
  &gt; &gt; wonder whether it&#39;s a fake.<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &quot;One person said the photo had been reviewed by a team of medical<br/>
  experts<br/>
  &gt; &gt; and they had determined that it was a hoax,&quot; Bruner says with a laugh.<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; More commonly, people want to know how the photo came to be.<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; Some opponents of abortion have claimed that the baby reached through<br/>
  the<br/>
  &gt; &gt; womb and grabbed the doctor&#39;s hand.<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; Not true, Bruner says.<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; Samuel and his mother, Julie, were under anesthesia and could not move.<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &quot;The baby did not reach out,&quot; Bruner says. &quot;The baby was anesthetized.<br/>
  The<br/>
  &gt; &gt; baby was not aware of what was going on.&quot;3<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; It seems like I have to do a whole lot more debunking on lists lately.<br/>

<br/>
Don&#39;t forward us stuff, please.   <br/>
The list isn&#39;t set up for forwards, it&#39;s set up for real communications among <br/>
the members here.<br/>
<br/>
And the only thing that fetal issues has to do with homeschooling is the <br/>
assumption too many people have that homeschoolers are conservative Christians who <br/>
are homeschooling for an array of political reasons including being &quot;pro <br/>
life.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
Keep politics off this list, please, as much as possible.<br/>

I&#39;d like for this list to be about how people learn in the absence of school <br/>
and schooling.  <br/>
