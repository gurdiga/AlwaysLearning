<div id="ygrps-yiv-240912753">There is one state in which the grey wolf population has stayed very healthy, <br/>
that is Alaska.<br/>
A few years ago, there was an overpopulation and there were problems with <br/>
them killing too many caribou and other wildlife. So in the interest of <br/>
preserving the wild herds and keeping the wolves in balance they decided that <br/>
there would have to be the killing of many of them from helicopters by the <br/>
state.<br/>
While the thought of killing many grey wolves from the air sickened me, I <br/>
also knew that they&#39;d soon be starving to death once they had de-populated <br/>
the herds and their numbers would naturally dwindle. Starving to death does <br/>
not sound better than being shot in my opinion.<br/>
Anyhoo, there were environmentalists in other states that found out the plan <br/>
and understandably raised hell.<br/>
Alaska said they&#39;d be happy to  ship the grey wolves elswhere, who wanted <br/>
some?<br/>
Couldn&#39;t get a single state to take any. They ended up shooting some.<br/>
<br/>

&quot;The answers aren&#39;t important really...<br/>
What&#39;s important,  is knowing all the questions.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1498168913">Yes, over the years Alaska has had a very aggressive wolf management<br/>
policy.   I lived there during the very controversial air hunt and shoot<br/>
days when wolves and packs were chased and nearly run to death and then<br/>
shot from the air when they couldn&#39;t run any more.  <br/>
Alaska has had and maintains a stable wolf population because the wolf<br/>
prey population is healthy.   It&#39;s healthy because of wolves, not in<br/>
spite of them. <br/>
<br/>
Mostly the controversial air hunts have ended but the state Game Board<br/>
allowed hunting wolves from snow machines two years ago and there was<br/>
recently new legislation proposed that would expand the area currently<br/>
open to moving snow machine hunts.  The current area is 27,500 square<br/>
miles and the limit of wolf kills is 10 per day per licensed hunter.   I<br/>
believe the proposal to expand the area has failed. <br/>
<br/>
The worries about declining wolf prey populations by some accounts are<br/>
without merit.   Although the Delta caribou populations have decreased<br/>
steadily since about 1989, some estimate the decline between 1,000 and<br/>
4,000 animals, which is significant,  biologist report naturally<br/>
declining wolf numbers in the area already.   Wolves respond to declining<br/>
prey populations by slowing their reproductive rate. And the overall<br/>
caribou and moose populations throughout the state are stable and even<br/>
increasing, despite the Delta herd decline.   There are several biologist<br/>
expressing their opinion that the caribou decline at Delta is due to<br/>
changing weather patterns and decreasing food supply as much as<br/>
predation.<br/>
<br/>
There is a recent proposal to kill wolves in a game management area near<br/>
Anchorage.   There is an estimated 120 wolves in the area in 13 packs.  <br/>
I haven&#39;t heard yet about the plan or the numbers.   They will of course<br/>
have to kill bears too, because decreased wolf population could directly<br/>
result in increased bear encounters as bears will take up the slack in<br/>
the predation of local moose.   <br/>
<br/>
The very, very bottom line is Alaska can and does make huge amounts of<br/>
money in these areas, Delta game management area south of Fairbanks and<br/>
Game management area 16B near Anchorage,(across Cook Inlet, north and<br/>
west of Anchorage)  from local and out of state big game hunters.  <br/>
Declining moose and caribou numbers means declining revenue to the State<br/>
and to local outfitters.   Alaska estimates 15% of it&#39;s population are<br/>
hunters, that&#39;s enormously more than any other state.   Politically,<br/>
hunters in Alaska have a lot of clout, like ranchers in Montana. <br/>
<br/>
There is very little evidence to suggest wolves would starve themselves<br/>
by killing too many prey animals.   They have a very well defined social<br/>
structure and manage their own numbers reproductively.   No one on the<br/>
State Game board, primarily hunters and trappers, is concerned with wolf<br/>
welfare.  They are not worried about wolves starving to death.   They are<br/>
worried about the revenue of big game hunting and wolves are in direct<br/>
competition with humans in that area.  <br/>
<br/>
I was reading a book my brother has called Game Management in Montana. <br/>
It&#39;s from 1971 and it says, &quot;Records from 1875 to 1877 show about 30,000<br/>
wolf skins were shipped out of Fort Benton annually.&quot;  Four pages later<br/>
it says, &quot;The disappearance of the wolf from the State was due to the<br/>
wolf&#39;s inability to adjust to civilization and not necessarily to control<br/>
efforts.&quot; <br/>

My point was rhetoric used to skew things in such a way to suggest that <br/>
wolves had never REALLY killed sheep or calves, and that they were honest, <br/>
hardworking, moral animals who had been unjustly accused.  <br/>
<br/>
If a political point can be made in a neutral way, that&#39;s the way it should <br/>
be made, not by word-witchery to tug the heartstrings of people who live in <br/>
cities and never will know anyone who owns stock or lives where any kind of <br/>
wild canines will take the babies.<br/>

<br/>
I agree with you.  It think SO many environmental causes have been hurt<br/>
by this kind of thing.  By the exaggeration of numbers, by the creative<br/>
use of language, when the REAL honest truth is really enough. <br/>
I hate that.   And maybe it&#39;s easier to cutesify a wolf because the pups<br/>
really ARE cute and they look like our own beloved pet dogs.  It&#39;s harder<br/>
to put the cuddly spin on a Bison. ( although the calves are cute)<br/>
<br/>
I hope knowing the truth about wolves does tug at heartstrings.  And I<br/>
hope those with heartstrings also understand ranchers raising animals for<br/>
slaughter aren&#39;t home crying because five deeply loved, cute, pet calves<br/>
were killed or maimed to die later by wolves.   They&#39;re crying because a<br/>
mature market animal is valuable, and those calves won&#39;t reach maturity. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have seen calves killed by wolves.  The rancher here who lost calves is<br/>
a friend of my husbands, and I was at the vets by accident when he was<br/>
called out to confirm it was wolves, so I got to go. One wasn&#39;t dead yet<br/>
and was shot and killed by the rancher after we arrived.  It happened in<br/>
the forest on public land.  Wolves didn&#39;t come sneaking in to his<br/>
picturesque barn like marauders in the night.   It&#39;s ugly, but it&#39;s not<br/>
worse than what your car will do to a deer and it&#39;s not worse than what<br/>
happens at the slaughter house and no one is actively working to put an<br/>
end to Fords or steaks.   Not every hunter has a clean kill every time<br/>
either.  Death is ugly.  <br/>
<br/>
Not in my area, but in the state, someone recently lost llama&#39;s to<br/>
wolves.  They were her pets, but she had staked the poor things out like<br/>
sacrificial lambs and it could have been avoided.   Education could play<br/>
a role in understanding if anyone actually cared to understand. <br/>
<br/>
It  comes down to money.  And maybe a little bit that WE want to be the<br/>
only predators left here.  <br/>

Thanks for these statistics Deb. That was my ongoing theory, without proof, <br/>
the last few years when we discussed this in the family.<br/>
I pointed to hunters as the real issue, not a true need for wildlife <br/>
management.<br/>
Seems these things always come down to money, how sad.<br/>
I did find it ironic that no one would take any grey wolves when they offered <br/>
to ship them.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I did find it ironic that no one would take any grey wolves when <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If it had been left to the folks who are concerned with wolf<br/>
reintroduction they would have taken the wolves offered by the state of<br/>
Alaska.   It was instead left to the politicians and you know what<br/>
happens. <br/>
<br/>
Three states were initially chosen for wolf reintroduction and they were<br/>
Montana, Idaho and Wyoming.<br/>
The politics that resulted in the import of wolves from Canada are<br/>
complex, but these states have had to fight a long and enduring battle<br/>
with their ranchers over the issue.  All three states have had political<br/>
power shifts recently over the last years and none are actively seeking<br/>
to maintain a wolf program.   In fact the current administration in<br/>
Montana  is working to have wolves de listed, so our ranchers can shoot<br/>
them.  <br/>
I think Idaho and Wyoming are as well.  <br/>
<br/>
No one imagines wildlife populations can &quot;manage&quot; themselves, as they<br/>
surely did without us for millions of years.   They must be managed by<br/>
humans and they&#39;re  managed to our financial benefit.  <br/>

<br/>
&lt;G&gt; Well, not &quot;only&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
***When a family decides to farm or ranch, as millions have done in the<br/>
past and <br/>

<br/>
***If ranchers were to budget in some extra animals to feed the wolves,<br/>
that <br/>
wouldn&#39;t &quot;appease&quot; them, it would increase their population. ***<br/>
<br/>
When an animal is killed in defense of life or property that&#39;s not<br/>
wildlife management.<br/>
When the government decides only certain numbers of wildlife are<br/>
economically beneficial, sets up bounty&#39;s on the pelts, sells tags, or<br/>
organizes mass killings, that is.<br/>
<br/>
Sheep and Cattle ranchers moved into the west in a hurry, fencing huge<br/>
tracts of land and displacing large healthy deer and elk populations.  <br/>
Because there were large healthy deer and elk populations there were<br/>
large numbers of wolves.   When deer and elk were killed off because they<br/>
were competition for grazing lands, or displaced, wolves found other<br/>
prey, the easy pickings of  sheep and cattle.   We all know what happened<br/>
to the buffalo.  When the wolves natural food supply was gone they found<br/>
another.   They were protecting their livelihood. &lt;g&gt;   Some of us get to<br/>
and some of us don&#39;t.   <br/>
<br/>
Ranchers don&#39;t need to budget for wolves because you and I pay them if<br/>
they loose an animal to a predator.  <br/>
<br/>
Deer and Elk and Bison  populations is Montana are now affected with<br/>
disease brought to them by domestic cattle.   The Bison being killed<br/>
under the guise of management of a disease were infected with the disease<br/>
in the first place by cattle.   <br/>
<br/>
Not a problem with an easy solution.<br/>
