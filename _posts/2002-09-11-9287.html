<div id="ygrps-yiv-1936030221">Hi ladies<br/>
 <br/>
bedtime last night was interesting... Steve and I put a movie for the<br/>
kids and started to watch one ourselves (thank goodness for vcr&#39;s)...<br/>
Zak watched his movie and Max kept coming out and running around in<br/>
front of the tv, which was fine because before the movie was on for 10<br/>
mins DH was asleep on the couch (he&#39;s been working long days lately)...<br/>
So I put the kids to bed and we went to bed and I read while peace<br/>
reigned in the house.  I guess I&#39;ll just keep trying.... The good news<br/>
is that we all got a great night&#39;s sleep.  I was asleep the latest at<br/>
10pm (LOL).... Where have my younger days gone when I could stay up all<br/>
night <br/>
