<div id="ygrps-yiv-1407514543"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I need to make a food road trip.  The food here in<br/>
&gt;michigan is, well -stinky.  I find it hard to find<br/>
&gt;really good food in affordable restaurants.<br/>
&gt;Everything is meat and potatoes - crappy gravy(not<br/>
&gt;the real stuff, just thebeef or chicken base blech). <br/>
&gt;I love really good food, but usually that is<br/>
&gt;something homemade or super expensive at a fancy chic<br/>
&gt;chic pooh pooh place that I can only afford once a<br/>
&gt;year(at the most).  <br/>
&gt;sistakammi - hungry<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was really spoiled with good, inexpensive food when<br/>
I grew up in San Francisco.  I learned to love Greek<br/>
food, Cambodian (with it&#39;s combination of exotic<br/>
spices and veggies with the french genius for sauces),<br/>
Dim Sum, fresh Seafood (YUM!), Swiss-French food,<br/>
Sushi and Tempura, Italian (Haystack Pizza and Italian<br/>
Food mmmmmm), and many others kinds of food.  One of<br/>
my favorite things to do as a teenager was to buy a<br/>
special kind of seafood sandwich that was sold by one<br/>
of the vendors on Fisherman&#39;s Wharf.  It as a creamy<br/>
saucy shrimp-scallop hot sandwich on San Francisco<br/>
sourdough, messy and wonderful.  We used to go to<br/>
Ghiradhelli to have ice cream sundaes with names like<br/>
Klondike, and the Cable Car.  The new Pizza Hut &quot;New<br/>
Yorker&quot; pizza reminds me of lunches scarfing a huge<br/>
cheesy floppy slice at Escape From New York pizza on<br/>
Haight street.<br/>
<br/>
My love affair with food, luckily for my husband,<br/>
carries over into being a not too shabby chef and<br/>
baker myself.  My favorite way to cook involves a lot<br/>
of improvisation, and I have introduced him to a lot<br/>
of things he never ate before we were married.  I like<br/>
to experiement and USUALLY things turn out pretty<br/>
well, with the occassional failed experiment.  <br/>
<br/>
But I have eaten good food all over the country and<br/>
would love to do a food road trip.  What a great idea!<br/>
 I could just taste the smorgasboard of learning<br/>
opportunities, haha.  I have had good German food with<br/>
speatzel (spelling) and sausages and whatnot in<br/>
Leavenworth, WA.  Family Style restuarants in<br/>
Pensylvania (where you share big trestle tables with<br/>
other diners and pass around large platters, plates,<br/>
bowls and baskets of good farm style food were a fun<br/>
experience.  That&#39;s where I first had ShooFly Pie.  I<br/>
LOVE Sopapilla&#39;s as well, which I had on trips to San<br/>
Diego and to the Southwest, as well as the year I<br/>
lived in Albuquerque, and I love fry bread too. <br/>
Devonshire Cream ice cream was wonderful on the<br/>
Cornish coast of England.  I remember having some<br/>
wonderful fudge in Michigan.  The food in New Orleans<br/>
was an memorable experience as well.  It&#39;s been too<br/>
long since I hit the road to delight my taste buds<br/>
with the diversity of American food that didn&#39;t come<br/>
with a drink carrier through a little window into your<br/>
car.<br/>

Well, we happened to go by there tonight. I picked Mark up at the<br/>
airport and then stopped by there (LAX, then down to Long Beach) to eat<br/>
dinner.  The sopapillas were on the desert part of the menu, served with<br/>
butter and honey.  Butter?  For a bit extra, you could get ice cream on<br/>
the side.  The chili was pretty good, I sorta special ordered a rolled<br/>
enchallada, chicken, with green chili sauce--it did have a good bit of<br/>
bite, so I was happy with that.  The sopapillas were sad, so sad.  I had<br/>
such a taste for them, and I was so disappointed. They were flat,<br/>
overcooked, and tasted like poor fry bread.  Sigh.  It was also rather<br/>
expensive, about $12 for a plate, i ncluding salad.  With ranch<br/>
dressing.  My poor little california children ordered pizza and a hot<br/>
dog.  (visual here--joylyn shaking her head sadly).<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Oh the memories! I used to live on Clayton Street <br/>
&gt;(around the corner from Escape From New York pizza)!<br/>
&gt;Did you eat at Chapella&#39;s (sp?)? I used to live on<br/>
&gt;pizza and burritos!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, and there was a place in the Mission district<br/>
that we used to get free coupons for from the youth<br/>
shelter down there.  They had these HUGE burritos and<br/>
a big make line under glass, like Subway&#39;s.  You would<br/>
tell them as they went along what you wanted in your<br/>
burrito and then they would roll the whole thing up<br/>
and they were normally like 2 bucks and came out about<br/>
6 inches around and a foot long.  There was also<br/>
Haight Street Deli, further East, where they made my<br/>
favorite chicken sandwich with a breaded chicken<br/>
breast in strips, cucumber and sprouts and zesty<br/>
homemade ranch dressing on sourdough.  I also used to<br/>
work at Boudin&#39;s bakery, in Embarcadero Center.  The<br/>
lunch rush was insane, but we got to take free bread<br/>
home every day and they had those sourdough bread<br/>
bowls with clam chowder.  That&#39;s where I fell in love<br/>
with Ceasar salads.  When I was not in the mood for<br/>
their food I would walk over to the Sushi place at<br/>
Embarcadero on my break and get California Rolls and<br/>
other yummies.<br/>
<br/>
One of my favorite restaurants was Ankor Wat<br/>
(spelling??) cambodian food, on Geary.  Anyone know if<br/>
it is still there?  My family was friends with the<br/>
owners, who were from Cambodia obviously.  I remember<br/>
Paprika&#39;s Fono (Greek Food) on the top floor at<br/>
Embarcadero (in the brick building above the mermaid<br/>
fountain).  I loved that greek flat bread they served<br/>
hot that you rubbed fresh garlic cloves on like<br/>
butter.  <br/>
<br/>
One thing that I never saw much was drive through&#39;s. <br/>
There are not many of those in the city, space is too<br/>
tight for those sprawling parking lots.  (sigh)  It&#39;s<br/>
been a long time, and I really want to take my husband<br/>
to San Francisco and show him around.  I am sure a lot<br/>
has changed.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Cornish coast of England.  <br/>
<br/>
&gt;And when were you in Cornwall? I had no idea. Where<br/>
&gt;did you go in Cornwall? Did you go to Devon as well?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was there about 7 or eight years ago.  I toured<br/>
London, took the chunnel to Paris and did the Lourve<br/>
and such and then back to England to tour the<br/>
southwest contryside a bit, to Tintagel (which I<br/>
loved, having just read Mists of Avalon in preperation<br/>
LOL) and around the area.  <br/>
<br/>
We stayed mostly in farmhouse bed and breakfasts and<br/>
that was where I first fell in love with cob<br/>
construction, in all those picturesque thatched<br/>
cottages along the coast.  My husband is getting a new<br/>
Natural Building business going with cob as one main<br/>
method he is using.  I keep telling him that a trip to<br/>
the british isles to study the cob homes would be a<br/>
legitimate business expense.  LOL<br/>

My family went there once when my sister was a baby, and my dad got<br/>
progressively more drunk as dinner wore on, and he finally decided to put<br/>
the bottle sideways on the table and play &quot;Spin the bottle&quot;... *Crash!*<br/>
the waiter was there in seconds, he had been watching the whole thing go<br/>
down.<br/>
<br/>
We also dropped my colicky sister on her head that evening, and she cried<br/>
and then fell asleep, giving us the most peaceful evening we&#39;d all had in<br/>
months...<br/>

Odd memories..<br/>

I also have a lot of Hungarian relatives. I remember some of the food my Grandma used to make. She made a very delicious treat called plum dumplings. Also palacsinta (basic crepes with a variety of fillings), the best cabbage rolls, a rolled up poppy seed cake and strudels. She would make a huge abundance of foods like these (I guess she was used to it after raising 7 boys) and I remember eating as much as I could and stuffing myself and loving that food, that was made with love. Very nice memories...and they&#39;re making me hungry!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1460037799">My grandma has also sworn off her old cooking and baking since she lives alone now. She once told me she&#39;s happy she doesn&#39;t have to cook like she used to anymore, and just makes her simple meals for herself. I&#39;ve found some very authentic looking Hungarian recipes (while searching with Google) and if I ever get the urge to have some Hungarian food, I can attempt to make it myself. My grandma did show me a thing or two in the kitchen. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Oh and yes, Joyce, I recognize that word kolache very well now that you mentioned it. I had forgotten that those rolled up poppy seed thingies had a name!<br/>
