<div id="ygrps-yiv-672810226">The only time I say rubbish is when I say &quot;That&#39;s a bunch of rubbish&quot;  and I&#39;m not referring to trash ;)  But we do put the trash out or garbage out and we put garbage in the trash.  We use garbage and trash interchangeably.<br/>
<br/>
And American English is not the same all over the USA either.  Just within the state of Illinois - in Southern IL we called it a soda and my cousins in Northern IL called it a pop.  Pronunciations vary a lot too.<br/>
