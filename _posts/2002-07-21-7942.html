The only words I can say are...I&#39;m so sorry, and I know they just <br/>
pale in comparison with what you are feeling right now.<br/>

It&#39;s been over 9 years since we lost our son Jay.<br/>
Though it seems a life time ago, he has always been very much a part <br/>
of our lives.  <br/>
Through all the pain, I have always considered him a blessing to us, <br/>
and can vividly remember the joy he brought to us for the eight <br/>
months I carried him, and the joy he still brings to us in all of the <br/>
memories of the beauty he brought out in our family and friends in <br/>
that time of mourning.<br/>
I love your sons name and the idea of each of you giving him one.<br/>
