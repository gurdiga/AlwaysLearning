<div id="ygrps-yiv-1271425638">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Shae & I have 3 daughters. Tannah is almost 6, Willow is 3 1/2 & Harper is almost 2. We live in Melbourne, Australia & are really active in the local unschooling community.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really struggling with some aspects of unschooling food & wanted to hear some thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
My girls have absolute self-regulation when it comes to times they eat & amount as well as being able to choose &quot;non traditional&quot; choices like cereal for dinner etc but it feels very counter intuitive to purchase or not intervene when it comes to very artificial foods and lots of colours & preservatives.<br/>
<br/>
I feel like I&#39;m asking more than they are capable of self-regulating, that these &quot;foods&quot; are designed to be addictive & very very appealing through packaging etc. Also I can&#39;t deny the effect some of these additives have on my kids! Tantrums, tears and even nightmares-especially with Willow, she seems very sensitive to colours & preservatives.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand I really understand that by making these foods forbidden they will be more exciting & more likely to be gorged on when oppertunity arises. It doesn&#39;t feel comfortable to restrict their food choices but it doesn&#39;t feel comfortable to watch my kids eat bright yellow twisties either-nor to watch the aggression that often follows.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m conflicted!! Keen to discuss<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-370691170">Others will have other ideas, but of all the post what I think would help is if you would think of what your girls have, and what you have in deciding how to proceed, is choices.   Not &quot;self-regulation&quot; (you used &quot;self-regulation&quot; and &quot;self-regulating), but an infinite number of choices.<br/>

<br/>
Have you done an elimination diet, so that you are positive it&#39;s the additives that cause the &quot;tantrums, tears, and nightmares&quot;? You are *sure* there are no other reasons for those behaviors, such as being tired or needing food or any of the other reasons that can bring forth unhappines within a person?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
===these &quot;foods&quot; are designed to be addictive & very very appealing through packaging etc===<br/>
<br/>
I disagree with the &quot;addictive&quot; part, but I do agree that ALL foods are designed to be appealing. <br/>
<br/>
Apple growers certainly hope that their apples appeal to us enough that we want to buy more!! <br/>
<br/>
The produce department of our local grocery store is THE MOST appealing part of the store, visually. Not just to me, but to my son, as well -- a kid who loves potato chips and soda, but who, when grocery shopping with me, will choose way more produce *because of* it&#39;s visual appeal than he will potato chips or soda.<br/>
<br/>
It does a disservice to your children to assume they don&#39;t, or won&#39;t, pick up on the fact that processed foods are packaged to be visually appealing so that you&#39;ll buy them. My son&#39;s chosen packaged foods because of the packaging and has had his share of &quot;blah&quot;- or &quot;yuck&quot;-flavored foods, and he doesn&#39;t ask for those again. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
===Also I can&#39;t deny the effect some of these additives have on my kids!===<br/>
<br/>
Do you or any of your children have intolerances or allergies to &quot;whole&quot; foods? To any fruits or legumes or nuts or dairy or grains?<br/>
<br/>
If so, do you view those intolerances or allergies in the same negative way you view food coloring and preservatives?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
===It doesn&#39;t feel comfortable to restrict their food choices but it doesn&#39;t feel comfortable to watch my kids eat bright yellow twisties either-nor to watch the aggression that often follows.===<br/>
<br/>
Work towards balance.<br/>
<br/>
My son and I both are aware that if we eat sweets / sugary foods on an empty stomach without having a bit of protein beforehand, we will feel shakey and cranky and will be prone to easy frustration and tears. <br/>
<br/>
If we don&#39;t want to have a meal but we want something sweet and haven&#39;t eaten in several hours, we&#39;ll have some string cheese and pretzels before the sweet stuff or with the sweet stuff. <br/>
<br/>
My son knows that I&#39;ll say &quot;yes&quot; or some form of &quot;yes&quot; about sweets. But that&#39;s not the same as dumping a boatload of candy in his lap. Sometimes he&#39;ll ask to have a Coca-Cola or chocolate late at night. Since we don&#39;t often have caffeine we&#39;re both sensitive to it, and a glass of caffeinated soda or a chocolate bar 6 or 8 hours before bedtime will result in bedtime not happening when it normally does. In those instances, I&#39;ll often suggest a non-caffeinated soda or a different kind of sweet and let him know that I&#39;ll remind him about the Coca-Cola or chocolate early in the day the next day. And I make a point to do so! <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re absolutely sure it&#39;s the artificial coloring and preservatives that are causing the tears and unhappiness, find alternatives to those things. <br/>
<br/>
But if you&#39;re not absolutely sure it&#39;s the coloring and preservatives, I encourage you to step back from that assumption and your negative feelings about those things. Because if what you&#39;ve expressed here about them is expressed even a wee bit in your household, your kids will have picked up on your feelings.<br/>

<br/>
What I meant is to find the same type of food but without whatever dye or preservative is problematic. I know there aren&#39;t always options, but there are many nowadays. <br/>
<br/>
If you can&#39;t find an alternative, and the dye or preservative isn&#39;t an allergen, perhaps offer it in smaller amounts, alongside other appealing-to-your-kids foods. For example, yellow twisties (is that licorice?) could be offered on a snack plate with cheese cubes or string cheese + pretzels + mini-bagels + cute up fruit of some sort. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1601894898">It is so easy to see what you are looking for that sometimes you don&#39;t see what <br/>
is really there. If you have a prediction that certain foods will cause certain <br/>
kinds of behaviour it is much more likely to come true than if you don&#39;t start <br/>
with that bias. That&#39;s why so much testing of pharmaceuticals is done with <br/>
double blind, randomised trials. There is some hope that the bias that the <br/>
humans bring to bear on the study will have less of an effect. And even with <br/>
that, it is still hard to tease bias from real response to treatment. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When David and I stepped away from limiting what foods Simon and Linnaea ate and <br/>
stepped into helping to get them what they wanted to eat plus the things we <br/>
thought they would enjoy eating it wasn&#39;t hands off. If I noticed Linnaea going <br/>
and getting bag after bag of Wotsits (similar to twisties or cheese puffs in the <br/>
U.S.) I would put together a platter of some other options for her, or ask if <br/>
she was hungry for something other than wotsits and needed me to get it. When <br/>
they were littler they ate smaller amounts at more frequent intervals, they got <br/>
hungry more often. So keeping easy to put together options to hand made it much <br/>
easier for me to give them more choices. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sandra has kept something I wrote from ages ago that has a list of some of the <br/>
options available in our home: &quot;There is free access to food in our house.  <br/>
There are two bowlfuls of starburst fruit chews on the kitchen table and carrots <br/>
and celery cut up and floating in water in the fridge as per my Grandmother; <br/>
there are packets of crisps in the cupboard with weetabix cereal and muesli <br/>
cereal and whatever other kind of cereal; there is dried squid and sheets of <br/>
nori and crackers and peanut butter and chocolate chip oatmeal cookies and ice <br/>
cream and, and, andâ€¦  All things get eaten.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The all things get eaten line, that wasn&#39;t true. I&#39;ve thrown out a lot of <br/>
starburst fruit chews, &#39;cause they get melty. And I used carrots from a bowl of <br/>
water in the fridge the other day in stock because the carrots are a little too <br/>
sweet for Simon&#39;s or Linnaea&#39;s current preferences. Ice cream sits in the <br/>
freezer for an age. At the moment crisps are having a bit of a revival. But they <br/>
often wait for some friend of Simon or Linnaea to come over and eat them. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Balance doesn&#39;t happen every day, either. Whenever I&#39;d get nervous about what I <br/>
felt was an unbalanced diet from Simon or Linnaea I&#39;d keep notes. A day might be <br/>
too short to see the true picture. One day might have three donuts in it, but <br/>
two days might have three donuts in it, bagels, burritos, carrots, celery, <br/>
apples, and three days might have three donuts, bagels, carrots, celery, apples, <br/>
strawberries, potatoes, wotsits, burritos, weetabix, hummus, bread and butter, <br/>
ramen and on and on. A moment of dietary preference doesn&#39;t make up a diet, it&#39;s <br/>
just that moment. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But if what you are seeing is a kind of creeping yellow peril in a bowl of <br/>
yellow twisties than they will be writ large on your children&#39;s experience, for <br/>
you. If you see this extruded snack food as filled with potential for anger and <br/>
hostilities and unhappiness it will be hard for it to just be a moment of <br/>
dietary preference in your children&#39;s day. It will have a huge rippling effect. <br/>
If they&#39;d had homemade bread and butter and an apple and had a hostile moment <br/>
afterwards I assume that the food would have had no bearing on the anger? It may <br/>
be worth examining your causal links in your head. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Actually, if you are making a list of what they eat, you could add in a list of <br/>
how their moods run. And if the pattern that you see now persists, maybe see if <br/>
on the days when they are eating more of the yellow twisties side of the options <br/>
set, if they are more tired and more in need of quick energy. Or if you are less <br/>
available to them or out more.<br/>
<br/>
 Food allergies and intolerances are apparently quite rare but the perception is <br/>
that they are quite common. According to wikipedia <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_intolerance)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_intolerance)</a>: &quot;Estimates of the prevalence of <br/>
food intolerance vary widely from 2% to over 20% of the population.So far only <br/>
three prevalence studies in Dutch and English adults have  been based on <br/>
double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges. The  reported prevalences of <br/>
food allergy/intolerance (by questionnaires)  were 12% to 19%, whereas the <br/>
confirmed prevalences varied from 0.8% to  2.4%. For intolerance to food <br/>
additives the prevalence varied between  0.01 to 0.23%.&quot;<br/>

In a chat a while back someone said something about diet being the new religion, and I think it&#39;s a valid consideration.  Virtue and morality are &quot;proven&quot; by someone being thin and strong.  Not thin or not strong are seen as sin, sloth, ignorance and immorality.<br/>
<br/>
In general terms, for someone to have enough fear/concern to want to concentrate on the worshipful end of a religion (god or the goal of perfection/salvation), there must be demons, devils and other dangers.  <br/>
<br/>
In the more extreme sects of this foodie religion, there are all sorts of self-flagellations and commandments and sacrifices.<br/>
<br/>
From the point of view of unschooling, it can hamper and hinder a child&#39;s learning.  If the mom is telling him what is and isn&#39;t, and what she&#39;s saying turns out not to be true, it erodes the relationship, too.  If the mom is looking at the child through an overlay of fear and expectation and &quot;told you so,&quot; that can be a problem.<br/>

      It is so easy to see what you are looking for that sometimes you don&#39;t see what <br/>
<br/>
is really there. If you have a prediction that certain foods will cause certain <br/>
<br/>
kinds of behaviour it is much more likely to come true than if you don&#39;t start <br/>
<br/>
with that bias. That&#39;s why so much testing of pharmaceuticals is done with <br/>
<br/>
double blind, randomised trials. There is some hope that the bias that the <br/>
<br/>
humans bring to bear on the study will have less of an effect. And even with <br/>
<br/>
that, it is still hard to tease bias from real response to treatment. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When David and I stepped away from limiting what foods Simon and Linnaea ate and <br/>
<br/>
stepped into helping to get them what they wanted to eat plus the things we <br/>
<br/>
thought they would enjoy eating it wasn&#39;t hands off. If I noticed Linnaea going <br/>
<br/>
and getting bag after bag of Wotsits (similar to twisties or cheese puffs in the <br/>
<br/>
U.S.) I would put together a platter of some other options for her, or ask if <br/>
<br/>
she was hungry for something other than wotsits and needed me to get it. When <br/>
<br/>
they were littler they ate smaller amounts at more frequent intervals, they got <br/>
<br/>
hungry more often. So keeping easy to put together options to hand made it much <br/>
<br/>
easier for me to give them more choices. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sandra has kept something I wrote from ages ago that has a list of some of the <br/>
<br/>
options available in our home: &quot;There is free access to food in our house.  <br/>
<br/>
There are two bowlfuls of starburst fruit chews on the kitchen table and carrots <br/>
<br/>
and celery cut up and floating in water in the fridge as per my Grandmother; <br/>
<br/>
there are packets of crisps in the cupboard with weetabix cereal and muesli <br/>
<br/>
cereal and whatever other kind of cereal; there is dried squid and sheets of <br/>
<br/>
nori and crackers and peanut butter and chocolate chip oatmeal cookies and ice <br/>
<br/>
cream and, and, andâ€¦  All things get eaten.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The all things get eaten line, that wasn&#39;t true. I&#39;ve thrown out a lot of <br/>
<br/>
starburst fruit chews, &#39;cause they get melty. And I used carrots from a bowl of <br/>
<br/>
water in the fridge the other day in stock because the carrots are a little too <br/>
<br/>
sweet for Simon&#39;s or Linnaea&#39;s current preferences. Ice cream sits in the <br/>
<br/>
freezer for an age. At the moment crisps are having a bit of a revival. But they <br/>
<br/>
often wait for some friend of Simon or Linnaea to come over and eat them. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Balance doesn&#39;t happen every day, either. Whenever I&#39;d get nervous about what I <br/>
<br/>
felt was an unbalanced diet from Simon or Linnaea I&#39;d keep notes. A day might be <br/>
<br/>
too short to see the true picture. One day might have three donuts in it, but <br/>
<br/>
two days might have three donuts in it, bagels, burritos, carrots, celery, <br/>
<br/>
apples, and three days might have three donuts, bagels, carrots, celery, apples, <br/>
<br/>
strawberries, potatoes, wotsits, burritos, weetabix, hummus, bread and butter, <br/>
<br/>
ramen and on and on. A moment of dietary preference doesn&#39;t make up a diet, it&#39;s <br/>
<br/>
just that moment. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But if what you are seeing is a kind of creeping yellow peril in a bowl of <br/>
<br/>
yellow twisties than they will be writ large on your children&#39;s experience, for <br/>
<br/>
you. If you see this extruded snack food as filled with potential for anger and <br/>
<br/>
hostilities and unhappiness it will be hard for it to just be a moment of <br/>
<br/>
dietary preference in your children&#39;s day. It will have a huge rippling effect. <br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;d had homemade bread and butter and an apple and had a hostile moment <br/>
<br/>
afterwards I assume that the food would have had no bearing on the anger? It may <br/>
<br/>
be worth examining your causal links in your head. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Actually, if you are making a list of what they eat, you could add in a list of <br/>
<br/>
how their moods run. And if the pattern that you see now persists, maybe see if <br/>
<br/>
on the days when they are eating more of the yellow twisties side of the options <br/>
<br/>
set, if they are more tired and more in need of quick energy. Or if you are less <br/>
<br/>
available to them or out more.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Food allergies and intolerances are apparently quite rare but the perception is <br/>
<br/>
that they are quite common. According to wikipedia <br/>
<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_intolerance)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_intolerance)</a>: &quot;Estimates of the prevalence of <br/>
<br/>
food intolerance vary widely from 2% to over 20% of the population.So far only <br/>
<br/>
three prevalence studies in Dutch and English adults have  been based on <br/>
<br/>
double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges. The  reported prevalences of <br/>
<br/>
food allergy/intolerance (by questionnaires)  were 12% to 19%, whereas the <br/>
<br/>
confirmed prevalences varied from 0.8% to  2.4%. For intolerance to food <br/>
<br/>
additives the prevalence varied between  0.01 to 0.23%.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m really struggling with some aspects of unschooling food & wanted to hear <br/>
<br/>
some thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My girls have absolute self-regulation when it comes to times they eat & amount <br/>
<br/>
as well as being able to choose &quot;non traditional&quot; choices like cereal for dinner <br/>
<br/>
etc but it feels very counter intuitive to purchase or not intervene when it <br/>
<br/>
comes to very artificial foods and lots of colours & preservatives.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I feel like I&#39;m asking more than they are capable of self-regulating, that these <br/>
<br/>
&quot;foods&quot; are designed to be addictive & very very appealing through packaging <br/>
<br/>
etc. Also I can&#39;t deny the effect some of these additives have on my kids! <br/>
<br/>
Tantrums, tears and even nightmares-especially with Willow, she seems very <br/>
<br/>
sensitive to colours & preservatives.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand I really understand that by making these foods forbidden they <br/>
<br/>
will be more exciting & more likely to be gorged on when oppertunity arises. It <br/>
<br/>
doesn&#39;t feel comfortable to restrict their food choices but it doesn&#39;t feel <br/>
<br/>
comfortable to watch my kids eat bright yellow twisties either-nor to watch the <br/>
<br/>
aggression that often follows.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1979360150">===Sandra: If someone is unable to relax their prejudices and fears about food, unschooling will be hung up at that point.<br/>
 <br/>
Shae: I&#39;m stuck on this for sure but still can&#39;t help wondering if prejudices about some foods might not be a bad thing?=== <br/>
<br/>
How would prejudices about food be a good thing? Prejudice is limiting, and I don&#39;t understand how limiting can be a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
===Whether it&#39;s a moment of dietary preferences or not there is some pretty nasty &quot;food&quot; out there.===<br/>
<br/>
Why put &quot;food&quot; in quotes? <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re defining what is or is not an acceptable food, you&#39;ll be setting your kids up to be judgmental of foods they might be exposed to in their friends&#39; homes. If they try those foods and like them, will they feel you will be disappointed by them liking those foods? If they want to have those foods again, will they feel compelled to sneak them or lie about having them?<br/>
<br/>
Foods like liver & onions, or tofu, or menudo are not my cup of tea. But if I define them as &quot;food&quot;, in quotes, I&#39;m imparting a prejudice and my son, who values my opinion, may pick up that same prejudice. But then he may try them at some point and like them and wonder what&#39;s wrong with him because he likes something I&#39;ve discredited as not being worthy. He may begin to wonder what else I&#39;ve told him may not be what I&#39;ve said it is.<br/>
<br/>
Imparting prejudice can undermine the trust your child has in you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-200823318">If this were a list about food sustainability and food supply this would be a <br/>
fantastic place to have this discussion. This isn&#39;t. This is a list about <br/>
unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It can be easy to get caught up in one cause or another. It is easy for some <br/>
people to find lots of political/spiritual/ecological ideas or movements that <br/>
they feel passionate about. The goal with unschooling is to recognise that any <br/>
thing that is your passion is your passion. It isn&#39;t necessarily your child&#39;s. <br/>
For some people that means that they can&#39;t unschool, at least not radically, <br/>
because they can&#39;t let their child play with toys from China. For them the <br/>
importation of toys from China carries with it too many personal costs and <br/>
compromises to their political outlook or concerns to overcome. So they as a <br/>
parent put that limitation on their relationship with their child. For some one <br/>
else it may be that they can&#39;t unschool when it comes to their faith. They can&#39;t <br/>
take the risk to their child&#39;s soul. So that parent puts that limitation on <br/>
their relationship with their child. The more distance a parent puts between <br/>
them and their child, the more reasons to say no, not this one, the less their <br/>
relationship can flourish, the less they are working in partnership together, <br/>
the less well unschool will work. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am often impressed with the awareness Simon and Linnaea have of the greater <br/>
world around them. They are very good at making relatively informed choices. I <br/>
don&#39;t think it is possible to be fully informed about many things. Information <br/>
gets all fractal when you get too close. That&#39;s why unschooling works, <br/>
everything is linked, or, at least, it&#39;s possible to perceive links between most <br/>
things. So knowledge that starts about one thing moves out and in and around <br/>
lots and lots of other things. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If Simon or Linnaea were interested in the politics and policies of their food I <br/>
could do a lot to help them find information. But they aren&#39;t that interested. <br/>
They like to eat what they like to eat and they feel pretty good about David and <br/>
I finding it for them and preparing it. <br/>

<br/>
There are always more than two sides and &quot;the in between&quot; spans so vast an area, that it is difficult to find unbiased information, on any subject.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s an interesting look at how basically all medical research is flawed:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/11/lies-damned-lies-and-medical&#92;">http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/11/lies-damned-lies-and-medical&#92;</a><br/>
-science/8269/<br/>
<br/>
A quote:<br/>
&quot;Lies, Damned Lies, and Medical Science&quot;<br/>
&quot;Much of what medical researchers conclude in their studies is misleading,<br/>
exaggerated, or flat-out wrong. So why are doctorsÂ—to a striking extentÂ—still<br/>
drawing upon misinformation in their everyday practice? Dr. John Ioannidis has<br/>
spent his career challenging his peers by exposing their bad science.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
---Information is essential to a free mind! How much have you researched the issue<br/>

<br/>
I find this statement and others like it obnoxious. In the years I&#39;ve been a member of various unschooling discussion groups, it never ceases to amaze me when a parent comes to the list announcing, &quot;You don&#39;t know X; I&#39;ve done the research, I&#39;ve read X, Y, Z,, have you?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The answer is, &quot;yes.&quot; Most likely, many who choose to unschool are familiar with whatever piece of information is being offered. Most of the unschoolers I know arrived here after lots, and lots of thought and reading about *all kinds* of things. We are a pretty aware and well-informed group of people, I think. <br/>
<br/>
And, I&#39;m not so sure that the kind of information you&#39;re talking about *is* essential to a &quot;free mind,&quot; whatever that it.  Are the Sanema Indians any less free, in their minds, than someone with Internet access and a library card?<br/>

Tantrums, tears and even nightmares-especially with Willow, she seems very<br/>

<br/>
When I was a child, my parents put me through an elimination diet and decided that I reacted negatively to artificial red and green food colorings.  I remember that I did get a headache after I ate the red jello, but it may have come from any number of other things too. Like the fact that I also hadn&#39;t had any sugar for two weeks.<br/>
<br/>
I was about five when this happened, and I was the kind of kid who believed my parents about *everything.*  When they told me red and green dye was poison, I believed it.  I&#39;d turn down any such offerings, even when my parents weren&#39;t around.<br/>
<br/>
As a new mom, I made the same choices about food that my parents had made.  Sugar and food with additives weren&#39;t allowed in our house the first few years of our daughter&#39;s life.  When she was 3 and discovered blue ring pops (gem-shaped lolly on a band you wear around your finger), I explained, as my parents had to me, that it was poison, and she couldn&#39;t have it.<br/>
<br/>
A few months later, she got a taste of some fake blue food.  She let me know that I&#39;d lied. It wasn&#39;t poison. It was delicious!<br/>
<br/>
Even at three years old, she felt guilty though for loving something I had said was terrible, evil, would cause her harm.  How could she love something that hurt her? Although she didn&#39;t feel hurt, which just added to her confusion and my looking like an idiot. The trust she had in me to tell her the truth was damaged.<br/>
<br/>
Noor tics.  Sometimes a lot, sometimes not for months. There are a number of triggers, food coloring is one, chlorine is another, being exposed to Strep is by far the worst.  I buy natural plant-based dyes so we can make lots of colorful foods at home. But I also buy her blue rings and let her out in public where any number of people may be walking around with Strep at any one time.<br/>
<br/>
Just a word of caution though, it seems more people report reactions to annato than to artificial red/orange dye!<br/>

I know I questioned the validity of research  few post back, but the following study came to mind--it seems moms who were told their kids ate sugar, saw more hyperactive behavior than moms who were told their kids hadn&#39;t had any.  None of the kids were actually fed sugar, though. They gave them aspartame instead (yum!).<br/>
<br/>
I do think we often see what we expect to see, whether or not it is based on real evidence.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/kx10890h33351475/">http://www.springerlink.com/content/kx10890h33351475/</a><br/>
<br/>
&quot;This study tested the hypothesis that commonly reported negative effects of<br/>
sugar on children&#39;s behavior may be due to parental expectancies. A challenge<br/>
study design was employed, in which thirty-five 5- to 7-year-old boys reported<br/>
by their mothers to be behaviorally sugar sensitive, and their mothers, were<br/>
randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. In the experimental group,<br/>
mothers were told their children had received a large dose of sugar, whereas in<br/>
the control condition mothers were told their sons received a placebo; all<br/>
children actually received the placebo (aspartame). Mothers and sons were<br/>
videotaped while interacting together and each mother was then questioned about<br/>
the interaction. Mothers in the sugar expectancy condition rated their children<br/>
as significantly more hyperactive. Behavioral observations revealed these<br/>
mothers exercised more control by maintaining physical closeness, as well as<br/>
showing trends to criticize, look at, and talk to their sons more than did<br/>
control mothers. For several variables, the expectancy effect was stronger for<br/>
cognitively rigid mothers.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Talk to them. Explain marketing tactics. It&#39;s good information for all kinds<br/>
of venues in life... what are the magazines selling? The TV commercials? The<br/>
food packaging? Marketing is marketing, and discussing it has spawned some<br/>
amazing conversations with my kids.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Also I can&#39;t deny the effect some of these additives have on my kids!<br/>
&gt; Tantrums, tears and even nightmares-especially with Willow, she seems very<br/>
&gt; sensitive to colours & preservatives.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some kids are, some aren&#39;t. Keeping in mind that all food is chemicals, and<br/>
all chemicals have affects on people. My husband gets ill if he eats apples<br/>
on an empty stomach. Doesn&#39;t mean that apples are bad, just means he needs<br/>
to not do that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On the other hand I really understand that by making these foods forbidden<br/>
&gt; they will be more exciting & more likely to be gorged on when oppertunity<br/>
&gt; arises. It doesn&#39;t feel comfortable to restrict their food choices but it<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t feel comfortable to watch my kids eat bright yellow twisties<br/>
&gt; either-nor to watch the aggression that often follows.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In order for a kid to make choices, they have to have information. Rowan, my<br/>
oldest, was corn reactive. I don&#39;t know if he was &quot;allergic&quot;... that&#39;s a<br/>
specific word that has a specific meaning with regards to one&#39;s immune<br/>
system and a histamine response... I just know that he would flush bright<br/>
red, start running hard, slam himself hard into things, and just generally<br/>
get crazy. He didn&#39;t like how it felt, so we talked about &quot;this is corn,<br/>
this is how it feels.&quot; After a while, he learned how to make the choice, and<br/>
how to decide either to eat it and then take steps to protect himself<br/>
(usually by hugging me or his father), or not to eat it if he didn&#39;t feel<br/>
like dealing with the effects.<br/>
<br/>
Kids are smart. Smarter than marketing, smarter than assumptions, smarter<br/>
than our fears for their health. If you give them enough information and<br/>
accommodate their learning, they&#39;ll make the choices that work best for<br/>
them. Just keep communicating (that&#39;s a two-way thing).<br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s a bigger, deeper prejudice involved, though, and it has to do with the idea that children need to be taught *some* things. That&#39;s a prejudice to examine carefully. If it is true, then unschooled kids should have abyssmal diets. If unschooled kids don&#39;t then what else is going on to make kids more powerful than additives and advertising? <br/>
<br/>
Some kids (and age matters) are very drawn to visually appealing foods. My dd was like that when she was young, although not my stepson. It helped her to have very nutritionally dense foods that were as lovely as commercial foods - helped in the sense that she was more likely to eat a variety of things. Instead of railing against commercial ploys to suck in little children, I took some pages from their book and prettied up my offerings. <br/>
<br/>
Some kids (and adults for that matter) are more likely to choose foods that are convenient to eat. Kids are busy people! They don&#39;t necessarily want to wait for you to prepare something when there&#39;s a perfectly good pack of chips that only needs to be opened. So having foods available before kids are hungry or even bringing food to where a busy child is playing, can go a long way. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Whether it&#39;s a moment of dietary preferences or not there is some pretty nasty &quot;food&quot; out there. <br/>

<br/>
There are also some nasty memories in a loooooot of adults&#39; minds around food and control. It doesn&#39;t help your relationship with your kids - or their relationship with food or their bodies - to start labling foods as &quot;nasty&quot;. I&#39;m not a fan of marshmallows, for instance, but my dd loves them. A week ago, I bought her a whole bag of them and she promptly had bowl of marshmallows. I don&#39;t think she&#39;s touched them since - the bag is in the same place with (I think) the same number of marshmallows as a week ago. It wasn&#39;t a stellar choice in the moment in terms of nutrition, but she enjoyed eating them, and we had a nice time watching a movie while she did, and snuggling. I had a moment of &quot;oh geez, is she really going to eat All Those Marshmallows?!?&quot; but kept that to myself and I&#39;m glad I did. The marshmallows became a non-issue, just a snack on a snuggly afternoon with mom. That&#39;s better than the ongoing drama of rationing out a bag of marshmallows over a week. Its healthier in so very many ways. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Maybe your child would like to do research...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sometimes one or the other of my kids has an interest that leads to doing reasearch - reading lots of books or magazines, hunting things out online, asking questions of people. So far I haven&#39;t seen one of them want to research something *I* have issues with, though. If I&#39;m being weird (from my kids&#39; perspective) about something, they&#39;d really prefer to be left out of my angst. <br/>
<br/>
Right now my stepson, Ray (17), has some health issues and he&#39;s experimenting with his diet. His bio mom has biiiiig opinions on the matter and while he doesn&#39;t live with her and doesn&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; do what she tells him, he has found it easier, in terms of their relationship, to follow along with her ideas than to do any kind of research on his own. That&#39;s one of the ways relationship issues play into decision making. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been doing a little research on the side, looking for ways to support him and it has been a bit frustrating to keep running up against someone who has very strong opinions saying &quot;do it this way or you&#39;ll be sick forever and die&quot;. There&#39;s not much room for research or experimentation in that kind of relationship. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; You can present two sides, or the in between and the child can decide.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>***********<br/>
<br/>
This statement doesn&#39;t sound much like &quot;the child&quot; doing the research - it sounds like mom doing some research and framing the &quot;sides&quot; through her own lens. It may be a very fair and balanced lens from her perspective, but it isn&#39;t the same as a kid deciding for him or herself what aspects of information are helpful or valid.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Choice goes hand in hand with information. There is not real choice with out information.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>****************<br/>
<br/>
A parent has the ability to load a whole lot of emotional baggage onto &quot;information&quot; though and that can shut down thoughtful decision making. <br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true.<br/>
In order for a kid to pick up a piece of food and taste it, he doesn&#39;t need to know anything about it.  For him to decide whether to finish it should be based on how he feels about taking another bite.  Not the all of it or none of it, but one bite.  And then he might decide whether to take a third bite.<br/>
<br/>
There is &quot;information&quot; that some parents give children that ranges from propaganda to horror story.<br/>
<br/>
In order for a parent and child to have a good relationship, the parent needs to discover that children can learn a great many things without being &quot;given information.&quot;  And the child will have a good relationship if the parent isn&#39;t managing and controlling his decisions, or marketing propaganda to him, or exaggerating anything.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Explain marketing tactics. It&#39;s good information for all kinds<br/>
of venues in life... what are the magazines selling? The TV commercials? The<br/>
food packaging? Marketing is marketing, and discussing it has spawned some<br/>
amazing conversations with my kids.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Some parents are selling their kids on the parents&#39; politics and dietary prejudices and various cool-this-season fads in belief, color scheme, and political correctness.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I believe there are better choices to be made out there regarding food.  We<br/>
talk freely about those choices here at home.  We steer toward local,<br/>
organic (when available) produce, and free range animals.  We enjoy picking<br/>
our own produce and fruits when they are seasonally available.  Generally<br/>
speaking, we steer away from a lot of food colouring, high-fructose corn<br/>
syrup, and highly processed foods.  We talk about how the food choices we<br/>
make can have an influence the well-being of ourselves and our community.  I<br/>
believe this to be true.  Perhaps it sounds like propaganda to some.<br/>
<br/>
Having said this, tonight we had hotdogs and chips with dip for dinner.  It<br/>
wasn&#39;t a big deal.  It was an easy meal.  We all enjoyed it.  We eat out<br/>
often enough.  We like the restaurants that offer local fair, but we eat<br/>
other places too.  Our son loves Friendly&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
I believe we can have a better food choice compass, and that we can share<br/>
that with our kids.  I think we just have to be careful not to create an<br/>
environment where the strict adherence to a food lifestyle becomes more<br/>
important than the emotional well-being of those making their own food<br/>
choices.<br/>

&gt; propaganda to horror story.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I took some more time to reflect on this more, and a story came to mind:<br/>
<br/>
A few Halloweens ago we went out trick-or-treating with some friends.  Both<br/>
of our families had strong aversions to candy.  I cringe to think of it now,<br/>
but our fears were strong.  We started out to the first few houses.  My son<br/>
was so excited and happy.  He ran over to me, holding up a roll of candies.<br/>
These were his favourite.  He was jumping up and down, and happily<br/>
declaring, &quot;Look, mom!!  I got another one of these!!!&quot;  My friend turned to<br/>
him and got down to his level, mimicked his enthusiasm and said, &quot;Oh yay!!<br/>
Junk!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My heart races a bit as I type this story.  I remember my son&#39;s face.  He<br/>
looked confused and hurt.  I got his attention and said, &quot;That&#39;s awesome,<br/>
buddy.  I know you love those.&quot;  I kept his attention until he felt<br/>
comfortable again.  He seemed to recover, and ran to the next house.  At<br/>
that moment, I made a mental note *never* to share information in that kind<br/>
of way.  It was hurtful, and could never be helpful.<br/>
<br/>
I understand your point here.  It is what we do with the information we have<br/>
that makes all of the difference in our relationships with our children.<br/>
Thanks, again.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s not the full range.  That&#39;s one end.   :-)<br/>
<br/>
The story about a friend saying &quot;oh yay, Junk&quot; to a happy trick-or-treater is very sad.   I hope you said something to her, if not then later.  If not yet, now. :-)  <br/>
But even if she had said later in her VERY sweetest most compassionate voice that perhaps your son should refrain from eating that candy because it wasn&#39;t really on the high end of the nutritional scale, it would have been the same message, just (ahem...) sugar coated.<br/>
<br/>
Not all sweets are the same.<br/>
Some of what is said about sweets is false.  <br/>
The worst-offending candy on earth will not do as much damage as a single put-down to a child.  The candy will pass through in a day.  The put-down can last at least 50 years.  I remember things my mom and others said to me when I was young.  And when a parent, relative or &quot;friend&quot; is hateful and shaming in their &quot;advice,&quot; it can (and does, and has) cause a child to do the thing they don&#39;t like in reaction, out of spite, or to see if they really are right.<br/>
<br/>
If a child discovers the mom was wrong about an Oreo, he&#39;s less likely to listen to her about sexually transmitted disease, or the danger of driving when he&#39;s sleepy or under the influence of this or that.<br/>
<br/>
Though I can vouch for this idea from my own life, I&#39;m going to quote Pam Sorooshian:  <br/>
&quot;As we get older and our kids grow up, we eventually come to realize that all the big things in our lives are really the direct result of how we&#39;ve handled all the little things.&quot; ï¿½Pam Sorooshian, June 4, 2007<br/>

paragraph is worded.<br/>
<br/>
The wording of ideas is important on the list. People reading can&#39;t  <br/>
see what&#39;s going on in the home. They&#39;re building images from the  <br/>
words and trying to understand unschooling from the images they build.<br/>
<br/>
The first sentence paints a picture of mom deciding what the family&#39;s  <br/>
values will be. And then what follows:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We<br/>

&gt; make can have an influence the well-being of ourselves and our  <br/>
&gt; community. I<br/>
&gt; believe this to be true. Perhaps it sounds like propaganda to some.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>is lots of mysterious &quot;we&quot; as though everyone shared a brain. It  <br/>
paints a picture of mom decides the right way to believe. And all the  <br/>
discussion is about the right way of viewing the world of food. All  <br/>
the exploring is about the right way of experiencing the world of  <br/>
food. And everyone happily agrees because mom is right.<br/>
<br/>
Whether that&#39;s what it&#39;s like or not in your home, for people to build  <br/>
their understanding of unschooling, it&#39;s important to not work with  <br/>
those kinds of images.<br/>
<br/>
A more helpful image might be this: For every family there will be a  <br/>
default set of values and preferences that the parents use to make  <br/>
decisions when no one else cares. For instance, a radically  <br/>
unschooling vegetarian mom&#39;s meals will include any meat her kids want  <br/>
(as well as anything else) into a larger picture that will look more  <br/>
vegetarian than your average American home.<br/>
<br/>
Mom&#39;s values are likely to have a greater positive impact if she  <br/>
shares &quot;why this rather than that&quot; about the parts that are left up to  <br/>
her to decide rather than the parts the kids are exploring.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean she should never say anything. *If* the kids trust  <br/>
that she&#39;s lending her experience or even preference to help them  <br/>
decide, then advice will sound different than if she&#39;s using it as a  <br/>
barrier between them and what they want.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, if a child wants hot dogs, then &quot;Is it okay if we get  <br/>
these ones without nitrates,&quot; will be a way of mom using her values to  <br/>
help narrow the choices and make the decision easier. The child will  <br/>
see the values as helpful and useful and she can pass on why she  <br/>
prefers the nitrateless ones as a bit of information for the child to  <br/>
draw on in the future if he wants.<br/>
<br/>
But if a child wants the kind of hot dogs he had at the ball park the  <br/>
mom&#39;s &quot;These ones without nitrates are better,&quot; will be a roadblock  <br/>
between the child and what he wants. The child won&#39;t experience the  <br/>
values as helpful but as tools for mom to control what he eats.<br/>
<br/>
My default for shopping is sales and thrift stores (and eBay and used  <br/>
stuff on Amazon) but I never limited Kathryn to those. (It&#39;s hard to  <br/>
get the newest Pokemon game at a thrift store ;-) I didn&#39;t have an  <br/>
agenda of her one day agreeing that shopping thrift stores is better  <br/>
than full price stores. The goal was -- as with all choices -- for her  <br/>
to experience the pros and cons of each and make thoughtful decisions  <br/>
about what would be a better choice for her for whatever she wanted.  <br/>
Since looking for discounts was always a way to help her get what she  <br/>
wanted (and as a bonus save money) she sees them as a big positive. I  <br/>
think she&#39;s even more inclined to not want something if she can&#39;t find  <br/>
it cheap than I am because she never felt pressure to believe my  <br/>
&quot;right&quot; way.<br/>
