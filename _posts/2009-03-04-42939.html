<div id="ygrps-yiv-1753309044">Hi Mary,<br/>
<br/>
Here are some places we like to vist -<br/>
<br/>
Hole in the Rock in Papago park, this is right next to the Phoenix Zoo<br/>
(which is also nice).<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/15172">http://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/15172</a><br/>
<br/>
It is also near the Desert Botanical Gardens - great for a hike!<br/>

<br/>
For indoor entertainment, we like....<br/>
<br/>
Stratum Laser Tag<br/>
Maybe we are just deprived in Tucson,<br/>
but my kids (me, too!) occasionally drive 2 hrs just to play laser tag here<br/>
-<br/>

<br/>
Arizona Science Center is awesome!<br/>

<br/>
The Heard Museum is great.<br/>
Oh!  They are having their Indian Fair & Market on March 7 & 8.<br/>
I haven&#39;t been to it before, but we have attended their Hoop Dance<br/>
Championships.<br/>
I imagine their Indian Fair would be equally fantastic!<br/>

Amazing Jake&#39;s - indoor entertainment & pizza/pasta/salad buffet place.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1593661463">As a former Phoenix resident, I always recommend:<br/>
<br/>
Hiking - Echo Canyon Park (west side of Camelback Mtn), a taste of Sedona in the center of Phoenix; Squaw Peak, hiking as social event; and South Mountain Park (16,000 acres)<br/>
<br/>
Taliesin West - Frank Lloyd Wright&#39;s architecture school, still in operation, daily tours about how Wright integrated architecture, music, and the natural environment</div>

cool as it really seems to be. It is just a few minutes from the <br/>
conference site.<br/>

Chihuly: The Nature of Glass<br/>
November 22, 2008 to May 31, 2009<br/>
<br/>
The Desert Botanical Garden is excited to present an exhibition by <br/>
renowned artist Dale Chihuly. /Chihuly: The Nature of Glass/ will <br/>
feature new and unique works of glass artfully located throughout the <br/>
Garden. Dale Chihuly is known for his innovative glass sculptures, and <br/>
his work is immediately recognizable for its grand scale and vibrant <br/>
colors.<br/>
<br/>
Chihuly&#39;s spectacular creations are found in more than 200 museums <br/>
worldwide including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, London&#39;s Victoria <br/>
and Albert Museum and the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Garden <br/>
exhibitions of his work have been mounted at the New York Botanical <br/>
Garden, Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden, Atlanta Botanical Garden, <br/>
Missouri Botanical Garden, Phipps Conservatory and the Royal Botanical <br/>
Gardens at Kew. This is Chihuly&#39;s first exhibition in an outdoor desert <br/>
environment.</div>
