<div id="ygrps-yiv-1646845462">I didn&#39;t know I had so many things that could hurt at the same time.<br/>
Saturday we went on a &quot;walking&quot; tour of two extinct volcanoes in our<br/>
area.  Dylan is nutty about rocks and volcanoes, and even though we<br/>
didn&#39;t know the man leading the tour we knew he had studied these old<br/>
volcanoes and we knew two other geologist on the trip and some of the<br/>
other folks.<br/>
I had heard that this guy was in his seventies, and although I&#39;ve tried<br/>
hard not to be an ageist, as one of my sons passions is lowering the<br/>
voting age, I really thought it would be an easy walk.  I mean he&#39;s<br/>
seventy something,  how fast could he go?<br/>
Now, I ran some this spring until my knee gave me an excuse to quit and I<br/>
walk everyday and I hike, religiously, one day a week at least, so I&#39;m<br/>
not in the worst shape ever, but this gentleman was like an antelope!<br/>
So, we climbed a mountain.<br/>
Dylan had a wonderful time.  He asked so many questions that the guy<br/>
later came to me to find out how old he was and then told me they should<br/>
let ten year olds go to college.  (he meant it in a nice way)   Another<br/>
couple there took a liking to him when they found out his name is Dylan<br/>
Thomas, like the poet, and that he could recite rather dramatically, &quot;Do<br/>
Not Go Gentle Into That Goodnight&quot;.<br/>
I of course had to carry in my backpack the five hundred pounds of rocks<br/>
he collected along the way.   They are now spread out on my good platter<br/>
like a Thanksgiving turkey in the middle of the table, and will probably<br/>
be there for days while he looks at all of them under the microscope. <br/>
Dylan was merciful and didn&#39;t ask me to go walking with him this morning,<br/>
and he has a Karate class this afternoon and he&#39;ll be going strong but<br/>
I&#39;ll be lucky if I make it up the stairs to the Dojo. <br/>
I do know more today about two 50 million year old volcanoes though and<br/>
all it cost me was some Arnica gel and vitamin C.  <br/>
Were going camping this weekend and there&#39;s a 14 mile hike we&#39;ve been<br/>
planning so I&#39;ll have to do my whining now and get it out of my system.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-916499337">This young man posted the folowing, today.....I&#39;ll be<br/>
happy to forward any replies and links to him via the<br/>
Florida_Unschooler&#39;s list. Replies from persons near<br/>
his age would be good, too. I think. As so much is<br/>
redundant to what has gone before, on or off list is<br/>
helpfull. To me it is exciting that so many young<br/>
people are ASKING for help lately. When we were young,<br/>
there was no one. Makes me feel likt there has been<br/>
some progress in the world.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Hola!<br/>
<br/>
Hey My name is Rick and I have just started reading<br/>
&quot;The Teenage <br/>
Liberation Handbook.&quot;  I&#39;ve decided unschooling is<br/>
definitely for <br/>
me.  I want to be a scientist and I think that&#39;s one<br/>
of the best <br/>
reasons to quit school because science and math are<br/>
everywhere!  I&#39;m <br/>
almost 16.  I&#39;m having some problems though.  My mom<br/>
is freaking <br/>
out.  She thinks I&#39;m not going to &quot;get what I need.&quot; <br/>
i eased her <br/>
mind by proving that I can still obtain the Bright<br/>
Futures <br/>
scholarship through homeschool, but she still thinks<br/>
I&#39;m going to <br/>
have no friends and that I&#39;m lazy, reclusive, etc. <br/>
Does anyone have <br/>
any suggestions of how i can get the legal issues<br/>
straightened out <br/>
and how I can calm my mom down.  Also, I really want<br/>
to quit ASAP!  <br/>
School isn&#39;t healthy for me at all.  I&#39;m not learning<br/>
and I&#39;m <br/>
becoming very depressive and bored.  Busy work is SUCH<br/>
A WASTE OF <br/>
TIME, but my mom wants me to stay in until the end of<br/>
the semester <br/>
and then she&#39;ll &quot;think about it.&quot;  I&#39;m to the point<br/>
where I&#39;m about <br/>
to just stop going, so any help would be great!  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking forward to getting to meet you guys. <br/>
<br/>
-Rick<br/>
P.S.  Anyone in brevard County?<br/>
<br/>
