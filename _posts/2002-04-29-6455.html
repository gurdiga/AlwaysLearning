<div id="ygrps-yiv-23689389">Everyone has a point where the rubber meets the road. Racism is one of those<br/>
points with me. I would feel no less sickened if he had a link to child porn<br/>
or suggestions on how to beat women so the bruises don&#39;t show.<br/>
<br/>
So, for me, it would affect it. I don&#39;t willingly hang out with people who<br/>
are proud of their racism, whatever other nice qualities they may have.<br/>
<br/>
I can be around people I disagree with one some things. Not this.<br/>

My question is: What would you do in this situation?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not asking a political or racial question here, I&#39;m asking an<br/>
educational one.<br/>
<br/>
What is the  &quot;AlwaysLearning&quot; situation here? What would you tell your 10<br/>
year-old son? What kind of future interaction which you have with this<br/>
person? Does it affect your relationship to the club?  ?  ?<br/>

I wouldn&#39;t jump to conclusions about his interest is in that site.  My dh<br/>
kept the link to the God Hates Fags site, not because he agrees with it, but<br/>
because he doesn&#39;t, and finds it a useful peek at how some other people<br/>
think.  I have the HSLDA and Chalcedon Foundation sites bookmarked for the<br/>
same reason: easy access to first-source material in formulating the<br/>
opposing viewpoint.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Site?  ME?  I&#39;m so web-lame, I haven&#39;t even considered having a site.  I<br/>
don&#39;t get why ordinary people who aren&#39;t selling stuff even HAVE sites.  I<br/>
still don&#39;t even have a scanner, though I&#39;ve got a mac G4 now.<br/>
<br/>
Hypothetically, I would not post any links without a disclaimer.  If the<br/>
robotics guy&#39;s site said &quot;Stuff that interests me&quot; I would take that at face<br/>
value.  I&#39;m interested in WWII, Osama bin Laden, bluegrass music, dogs of<br/>
any kind, religion, embroidery, cleaning products, TV, time management,<br/>
education, pornography, birds, politics, comic strips, weed killers,<br/>
books....   That I&#39;m interested does not mean I&#39;m *supportive* of everything<br/>
listed above; I might be interested in earth-friendly weed killing<br/>
alternatives, or in the wholesale slaughter of all Pit bulls and anyone who<br/>
likes them.   You wouldn&#39;t know without knowing me.  If I had links only to<br/>
dog sites about killing off vicious dog breeds, you&#39;d begin to know --<br/>
unless I wrote about how wrong I think the sites are.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why I wouldn&#39;t jump to conclusions -- though I would certainly jump<br/>
to suspicions &lt;g&gt;  I think, if I was really concerned, I&#39;d ask the guy.<br/>
I&#39;ve had too much recent experience with conclusion-jumping to continue<br/>
doing it.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I&#39;m not a governement agency, I&#39;m allowed to judge people based on their<br/>
beliefs... it&#39;s one of the best ways to judge poeple, I think. How else<br/>
do you decide who you want to spend time with? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Whether they let their kids drink soda.<br/>
Whether they let their kids watch South Park or the Simpsons.<br/>
Whether they can laugh at goofy stuff without feeling too undignified.<br/>
Whether they show up on time or are somewhere between an hour and three days<br/>
late.<br/>
Whether they&#39;re nice to their dog.<br/>
<br/>
I guess those are beliefs, huh?<br/>
<br/>
--------------------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sure they are. And if people want to judge me or my family on those beliefs<br/>
and decide whether they want to spend time with us based on those beliefs,<br/>
I&#39;m all for it.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want people who judge me on what *I* think of as silly things around<br/>
me anyway, so they should have at it (and quite likely a bigot or a<br/>
wife-beater feels the same way -- if they didn&#39;t think they were right, and<br/>
that black people are inferior or that their wife deserved it because she<br/>
wouldn&#39;t shut the hell up, they wouldn&#39;t do it. Or at least they wouldn&#39;t<br/>
put it on a website).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s one reason I don&#39;t hush up at homeschooling gatherings when people say,<br/>
&quot;I won&#39;t allow my children to have chocolate&quot; (I say, &quot;We have a giant big<br/>
bowl of it available all the time.&quot;) or &quot;I won&#39;t allow my children to<br/>
associate with people who own guns (&quot;Oh, really? My husband is a competitive<br/>
target shooter. I think he has about 10 or 12 guns.&quot;) or &quot;I don&#39;t let my<br/>
children watch any TV but PBS.&quot; (&quot;We love TV. Brit&#39;s favorite show is<br/>
&quot;Survivor&quot; but we like lots of the reality shows.&quot;) Sometimes, this is<br/>
really helpful to people who look at our kids and see normal, healthy kids,<br/>
and are capable of thinking, &quot;Maybe chocolate and TV and all guns aren&#39;t<br/>
evil.&quot; Sometimes I am sure they run away as fast as they can.<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s fine with me if other people want to look at what I am and find me<br/>
&quot;evil enough&quot; not to spend time with. If their deeply held beliefs tell them<br/>
I&#39;m going to hell, I truly don&#39;t want to be around them anyway. I don&#39;t want<br/>
them gritting their teeth and seeking my presence just because I&#39;m a good<br/>
dog trainer, or bake good cookies. I don&#39;t want them having to hover over me<br/>
if I speak to their child for fear I might mention and encourage Pokemon.<br/>
<br/>
All I ask is that people judge me on what I really am. If they find that<br/>
lacking sorely enough, they *should* move on. If I think they&#39;re dumb for<br/>
doing so, well, that&#39;s MY opinion. Maybe I am going to hell, I won&#39;t know<br/>
for awhile (well, hopefully not for awhile! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
