<br/>
I can&#39; t get this article to come up - any ideas?  I really want to read<br/>
it.  Last fall I read Mark Rashid&#39;s last 2 books and loved them.  There was<br/>
such an amazing similarity to his ideas about horses and mine about people<br/>
(including children).  I have passed it along to many to see if it helped<br/>
them make the connection.  Anyway, this is a subject I&#39;m really interested<br/>
in and would love to read the article you referenced.  Thanks.  Anna</div>

hours between the time I sent it and when yahoo posted it.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you enjoy the article; the rest of her site is good, too.<br/>
