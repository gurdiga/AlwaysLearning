<div id="ygrps-yiv-1070952978">Periodically you get a look from your child that suggests that you have <br/>
revealed information that has thrilled them or changed their lives in an <br/>
amazing way.  Things like, &quot;Yes. you&#39;re right...you really DO need that new <br/>
computer that costs $6000 to complete your project, and of course I will get <br/>
it for you&quot; come to mind.<br/>
<br/>
I got one of those looks yesterday, and it has continued into today.<br/>
<br/>
I told my son Julian about SCA (Society for Creative Anachronism).  He is in <br/>
awe. The idea that there is such an organization, with all those cool things <br/>
to do and learn has just thrilled him. He loves the idea that there are <br/>
people out there like that. We spent an hour together looking at the web <br/>
sites and e-mailing local contacts, and he has glowed since.<br/>
<br/>
I think we have a new family project. (My partner Beth is also thrilled, as <br/>
there is a local Storytellers Guild.)<br/>
