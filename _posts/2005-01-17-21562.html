He did  get Christmas presents but before Christmas he hadn&#39;t asked for<br/>
one thing,  not a book, not a video game, not one gadget.   <br/>

==============<br/>
 <br/>
Neither of our  boys asked for anything for Christmas this year,  and I <br/>
didn&#39;t prompt them, either.  (Marty had given me a clue of something  Kirby might <br/>
like that he couldn&#39;t afford to get him, so I did.)<br/>
 <br/>
Holly asked for a sorting bank like one Kirby had had years before.   His had <br/>
broken, and he advised against it, but I said it was the only one she  had <br/>
wanted <br/>
 <br/>
A couple of days before Christmas Holly DID say &quot;I should have asked for  <br/>
this sooner, but for Christmas I would like a new doorknob for my room.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
I talked to Keith about it but didn&#39;t press.  On Christmas afternoon  she <br/>
said quietly to me,  &quot;I didn&#39;t get a doorknob.&quot;  She had liked her  other gifts.  <br/>
 A few days later Keith installed her a new  doorknob.  Hers had gotten loose <br/>
and noisy.  Quite worn  out. <br/>
 <br/>
Marty&#39;s birthday is in January.  He didn&#39;t ask for anything.  In  fact, he <br/>
said there wasn&#39;t anything he knew of that he needed.   We  had already gotten <br/>
him things before and stashed them by, and he was happy with  them.<br/>
 <br/>
Kirby used to like Ninja Turtles when he was little, and he still has them,  <br/>
and still has all the tapes of shows he made from TV, and those we bought  <br/>
him.  It wasn&#39;t a passing-fad interest to be thrown by when the new TV  season <br/>
came.<br/>
