<div id="ygrps-yiv-1861455795">I understand the always saying someform of &quot;yes&quot; and such but how do <br/>
you get your kids to clean.  I usually ask and most of the time they <br/>
just do it (odd I know) but what if they didn&#39;t ????<br/>
and I like a clean house so I am always asking but dissided that I <br/>
should pick my battles and let the basement be their &quot;all play all the <br/>
time&quot; room. (I told them I didn&#39;t care if it was clean or not because <br/>
it is their room)  But I am starting to feel like they should keep it <br/>
somewhat clean (you know, there is no food allowed but still)<br/>
so how do I approch this with out taking back their full ownership <br/>
(which I think is a good thing)??<br/>
or should I just let it slide like I originally said?? (heck noone but <br/>
kids ever see it!)</div>

 </span></blockquote>Which is more important to you -- your relationship with your kids, or<br/>
whether a neighbor might ever see the basement?  Deciding that will<br/>
probably help you decide what to do.<br/>
<br/>
That said, my kids tend to want to play more after I&#39;ve cleaned up<br/>
their playroom with them or for them.  Suddenly they can find their<br/>
toys again, and that open space on the floor seems to just call to them.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if you wanted to give your children a gift, you could, with<br/>
their permission, clean the basement for them or with them (in a fun<br/>
way), so that they would have a clean, enjoyable place to play.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Good ideas!   <br/>
And don&#39;t think you have to clean the whole thing at once.   Sort on type of <br/>
toy into a bin or basket and call it a day.   Another time, sort another type, <br/>
or pick up all lost pieces and put them in a little box, but don&#39;t bother to <br/>
try to put them all where they go.   Play   music while you work, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s very true kids can play better in a newly cleaned place, and don&#39;t <br/>
forget that playing is an important part of their learning, so think of providing <br/>
them clean places as part of what it takes to unschool.   All that time and <br/>
energy you save NOT &quot;doing lessons&quot;   can be put into playing, and straightening <br/>
up, and playing some more with your kids.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; how do you get your kids to clean.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How could your husband get you to scrub the garage floor?<br/>
<br/>
He could yell or threaten or bribe or beg. But what kind of <br/>
relationship would that create between you?<br/>
<br/>
What if your child  had a tower of collectible soda cans that was <br/>
always falling over. What if he decided that since you&#39;re part of the <br/>
family that restacking them once a week was part of your job. How could <br/>
he get you to do that? And how could he get you to stack them in the <br/>
&quot;proper&quot; (e.g. his) order? And what if you didn&#39;t do it to his <br/>
standards and didn&#39;t do as good a job as he knew you were capable of?<br/>
<br/>
Now what if he said once a week &quot;Mom, would you mind keeping me company <br/>
while I stack these cans? Maybe we could listen to a book on tape <br/>
together. Or you could tell me about the project your working on.&quot; <br/>
Sometimes you might not be able to join him because you were in the <br/>
middle of something.  Sometimes you might help him stack just because <br/>
it feels good to help him out. And if he was truly thankful in a way <br/>
that let you know that he knew there were more interesting things you <br/>
could be doing, you&#39;d be more likely to help him. On the other hand if <br/>
he criticized your stacking, or came to expect you to help him you&#39;d be <br/>
less likely to help and might even be less likely to spend time with <br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
So, how can you get your kids to clean?<br/>
<br/>
You could make them. And take withdrawals from your relationship <br/>
account with them to pay for it. They might be angry with you but you&#39;d <br/>
have a clean house.<br/>
<br/>
Or, if your relationship with them is important, you can shift your <br/>
thinking and see the house and all the tasks as belonging to you. And <br/>
then invite them to help. And acknowledge that you appreciate their <br/>
help -- no matter how small -- knowing that they could be playing a <br/>
video game or watching a favorite show instead and they&#39;ve chosen to be <br/>
with you.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; or should I just let it slide like I originally said??<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think creativity flourishes in controlled chaos better than in total <br/>
chaos or total clean.<br/>
<br/>
Someone expressed cleaning up her kids toys as like providing a fresh <br/>
canvas for them :-)<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when the house gets out of control I look at it and am <br/>
overwhelmed. There&#39;s just too much stuff and I don&#39;t know where to <br/>
begin. I think cleaning is like that always for kids, even when it&#39;s a <br/>
small task. I could see a huge difference in my daughter&#39;s attitude <br/>
towards a mess as she got closer to puberty. Now, though she&#39;d rather <br/>
do other things! ;-), tidying up doesn&#39;t seem like an insurmountable <br/>
mountain to her. Not because i trained her how to put things away!  ;-) <br/>
But just because she&#39;s older.<br/>
<br/>
I think you could keep their playroom from becoming a disaster area and <br/>
invite them along to help. But accept no as an answer.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well,  I&#39;m going to weigh in on a bit of a different tack.  My kids are <br/>
absolute whirlwinds about 15 hours out of each day.  They are loud, <br/>
boisterous, fun-loving and they leave the best kind of disasters in their <br/>
wake.  I love them dearly but they don&#39;t pick up after themselves at all <br/>
without reminders.<br/>
<br/>
I used to pick up for them or with them when they were little but as they <br/>
got older and involved in more and more things (and since they can&#39;t drive <br/>
it means I am shuttling somebody at least twice a day) I found I was simply <br/>
running out of time.  I couldn&#39;t clean for them, and care for them and run <br/>
them around and still get 6 to 8 hours sleep at night.<br/>
<br/>
So I did what I would do with my husband in that situation.....I talked to <br/>
them.  We brainstormed, we tried various ideas,  I really listened to <br/>
feedback, we tweaked things.<br/>
<br/>
What we do now is first have a sitdown meeting on Sundays to talk about the <br/>
week, who will be gone, who needs to get a specific thing from the store (we <br/>
live out of town), who has a specific concern, etc..<br/>
<br/>
Then each day everyone in the family has a list of what they need to do that <br/>
day.  It includes fun stuff you were wanting to do, reminders to feed pets <br/>
and brush your teeth, and to pick up one community room once per day, etc.. <br/>
This is very fluid, not rigid and varies with what is going on, etc..  And <br/>
it isn&#39;t just for the kids....dh and I also have lists.<br/>
<br/>
What makes this work for us is truly listening to each other and being <br/>
willing to work as a team.<br/>

I don&#39;t see it as the same as traditional &quot;CHORES&quot; where a parent assigns a <br/>
duty to a child and there&#39;s punishment if it&#39;s not done.   <br/>
<br/>
When people say &quot;my child has a responsibility to...&quot; (clean his room, feed <br/>
the dog, whatever) I think they haven&#39;t really looked at or thought about the <br/>
word &quot;responsibility&quot; very closely.     It means &quot;he is answerable to his boss <br/>
or superior officer for that.&quot;    The boss and superior officer in such cases <br/>
is the parent.   And sometimes parents will say &quot;responsibility&quot; as though <br/>
it&#39;s something completely   out of their hands, while it is actually completely <br/>
WITHIN their power and creation.<br/>
<br/>
Things that prevent choice and clarity seem to work against unschooling.<br/>
Things born of choice and clarity work with it.<br/>

It sounds like things are working out okay for you and your kids.   They help <br/>
when asked. They will probably be much older before they start  taking the <br/>
kind of initiative YOU do.  Since it doesn&#39;t seem to be an issue  in your home, <br/>
you&#39;ll probably see little bits and pieces of initiative here and  there and <br/>
more of it, as time goes on.  They&#39;ll do what  you&#39;ve been  modelling, but it <br/>
probably won&#39;t look exactly like what you do until they&#39;re  grown and in their <br/>
own homes.  At least, that&#39;s how it was for my grown  kids.<br/>
 <br/>
As for the playroom, I think I&#39;d happily tell them a day or two in advance  <br/>
that you thought it would be nice if it was better organized and that you&#39;re  <br/>
going to dig into it.  They might object, or they might get excited and  want <br/>
to help, and they might even say &quot;Can we do it today?&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t make Will clean his room, although I suggest it strongly if he has  <br/>
friends coming over.  He cleans it when he feels closed in (it&#39;s very  small).  <br/>
When I decide to tackle it and get it really clean, sort the  Legos, move the <br/>
boxes of toys out that have migrated in, vacuum, dust,  rearrange, etc., he <br/>
is SO grateful.  He could never do all that by  himself.  At 11, he&#39;s much more <br/>
helpful than he was at 6.  He can&#39;t do  it all in a couple of hours like I <br/>
can, but he will know *how* to do it, just by  watching and particpating as he <br/>
can.<br/>
 <br/>
So clean up the playroom, as a gift to your kids.<br/>
