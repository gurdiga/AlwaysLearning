How sad!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
At our homeschool bowling gathering the other day my friend and I<br/>
approached a family we&#39;ve never seen at it before. We asked the mom if<br/>
they were there to meet with our little party and figured we&#39;d introduce<br/>
ourselves. &quot;No&quot; the woman said pointing at one of her daughters, &quot; we&#39;re<br/>
just here celebrating cause she&#39;s going back to school tomorrow.&quot; The mom<br/>
had such a big smile and gestured like she just scored some big points,<br/>
won the lottery or something. My friend and I both thought how sad, we&#39;re<br/>
celebrating our kids being with us and she&#39;s celebrating getting rid of<br/>
hers.<br/>

Ouch!!  Man, this stuff is so sad.<br/>
<br/>
Liam and I were talking one day, and he had heard that some moms are really <br/>
glad to see their kids off to school at the end of vacations (I&#39;m not sure <br/>
where he heard this from), and he says he thinks that these moms &quot;hate <br/>
their kids.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But, it made me remember when I was little.  My mom worked full time-plus <br/>
(meaning weekends and late nights), and when summer vacation rolled around, <br/>
we kids got packed off to sleep-away summer camp for the whole summer (save <br/>
the last two weeks before school started, which was our family&#39;s summer <br/>
vacation when we would go away to the beach - I went straight from camp to <br/>
the beach and only got to be home the weekend before school started again <br/>
in September).  From my perspective now, I know she wanted us to have fun <br/>
and all and she worked real hard to be able to send three kids to <br/>
sleep-away camp for SIX weeks, but back then I couldn&#39;t get over the <br/>
feeling that she just really wanted to get rid of us kids.  I know I <br/>
shouldn&#39;t have taken it so personally, but there you are.<br/>
<br/>
I also vividly remember thinking that if I had had the choice, I would have <br/>
loved to have stayed at home and be with my friends and folks and sleep <br/>
late and go to the park and enjoy a lazy summer.<br/>

I wonder whether she&#39;ll put him up for adoption soon or if she really meant <br/>

Her baby&#39;s name is kinda like one of my kids:  Martin Alexander Dodd.  Or <br/>
Marty as he is known.  And he&#39;s been &quot;among the living&quot; with us since he&#39;s <br/>
had awareness of any sort.<br/>
<br/>
That poor mom and that poor baby.   She meant it as a compliment to her <br/>
co-workers, probably, and she probably does like her job, but so sad that her <br/>
life is compartmentalized that way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1471083469">I believe it&#39;s probably people like this that &#39;raise&#39; their kids w/ benign<br/>
neglect. Sort of babysitting rather being a parent of the great awakening!<br/>
Brianna is 10. I am constantly amazed at the wonder of her. She does so many<br/>
things, says so many things that I would miss were I working outside our<br/>
home. It&#39;s only Brianna & me, (well we have a dog and three birds) She&#39;s a<br/>
constant joy. Why would anyone want to miss this?<br/>
I have wondered why people have kids only to put them here, place them<br/>
there.<br/>
I can&#39;t buy that &quot;we need two incomes&quot; argument.<br/>
Brianna & I are a one-income family, and it&#39;s low income. We don&#39;t have many<br/>
things. We do have each other. We do have a relationship that&#39;s based on<br/>
trust, love, respect with a great dose of humor.  Brianna would be shocked<br/>
if I said something like that. She would also not believe it!<br/>
I feel sorry for those that are just going through the moves, not really<br/>
participating.<br/>
