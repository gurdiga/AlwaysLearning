<div id="ygrps-yiv-1782335263">The drainage system is not done right.  Some city<br/>
planners forget that wate takes the easiest path to<br/>
down. That is a problem in lots of urban areas. Alos<br/>
overcontruction in the natural path of ddrain-off<br/>
leads to flooding.  <br/>
<br/>
The rationing is so that the tank storage levels don&#39;t<br/>
get too low and the water heat up with pollutants<br/>
multiplying and/or geting too concentrated for<br/>
drinking. Also, when the water tables get low it is<br/>
more difficult to get the water into the human<br/>
consumption systems....and clean.<br/>
<br/>
What a blessing that most of us can safely drink water<br/>
from the tap  :-)<br/>
<br/>
We are in Fl, too, only 30 miles north of you, but a<br/>
slightly different aquifir.  And a well. Near a swamp<br/>
on a river.  No rationing here. No water woes (knock<br/>
on wood). <br/>
