<div id="ygrps-yiv-333559283">My husband just sent this to me.  It might be a good explore for a  <br/>
parent and child, or for just a parent!<br/>

This link is to an auction site (to be held soon) on a number of  <br/>
Islamic pieces.<br/>

On the site is a link to an e-catalogue that allows you to view the  <br/>
pieces (with a zoom function).  There are a number of weapons and  <br/>
calligraphy pieces in the collection. (I particularly like the inlay  <br/>
on the 18th century Indian ax.)  They even have some 10th century  <br/>
Egyptian glass pieces.  Total of 287 items.  Interesting to see what  <br/>
the truly rich spend their money on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-120536410">It is beautiful stuff, I just took a peak.  Sad though it isn&#39;t in its<br/>
countries of origin providing some perspective on history for the Cultures<br/>
who produced it.<br/>
<br/>
I did feel odd though that the science and technology and knowledge the<br/>
Muslims were discovering was at a time when the European Christians were<br/>
burning witches for using herbal cures, given the whole Christian debate on<br/>
this list;)  Funny how history progresses.  I remember being surprised to<br/>
read at some point as a teen that the Muslims were using science at a time<br/>
when the Christians were putting ashes on their foreheads, and casting<br/>
demons to cure the sick.  We get so much from that area of  the world, even<br/>
the Greek philosophers/scientists(Euclid&#39;s elements tablet for sale on the<br/>
site) got &#39;rediscovered&#39; through the Muslim libraries.  I don&#39;t understand<br/>
the development of gender politics there though.<br/>
<br/>
I remember when reading about menstruation in Muslim culture seeing two<br/>
possible interpretations explained:  one contention was that there was a<br/>
mistranslation from older transcripts that claimed menstruating women needed<br/>
to be excused to rest as they were vulnerable during this time, and the<br/>
other contention was that menstruating women were sick/unclean and society<br/>
needed to be protected from them.  I always love the contradictions, and the<br/>
re-discovery of knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
Sad the truly rich can have pieces of history as knickknacks!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the post,<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think there ever has been a time or place in which that wasn&#39;t  <br/>
true.  It&#39;s less true now than before, quite likely.   Museums and  <br/>
universities buy things now; they don&#39;t just go to the guy with the  <br/>
winningest army and the biggest fortress.<br/>
