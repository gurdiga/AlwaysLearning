<div id="ygrps-yiv-2015843989">Dawn in Tucson here.  I heard at my homeschooling meeting that Sandra had<br/>
started a new group (yes I know it was last year now) and I decided it would<br/>
be a good forum for me to join.<br/>
<br/>
We are now into month 5 of unschooling and I&#39;m finding that I&#39;m letting go a<br/>
lot more.  I became so overwhelmed when I first started because I tried to<br/>
sign Zak up for everything anytime he mentioned he was interested in<br/>
something.  So finally we are cutting all the way back and letting us live a<br/>
bit more.<br/>
<br/>
So question from me is how long does it take for me to be &quot;deschooled&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Happy to have a place that I can come to.<br/>

sounds cool and we get way too involved in too much activity. I know other <br/>
people who have to coax their kids into getting involved in stuff -- but that <br/>
isn&#39;t a problem here. I think one role of the parent is to know when to coax <br/>
and when to limit. Kids sometimes can&#39;t project into the future well enough <br/>
to predict what life will be like if they do just this one more activity. And <br/>
they probably won&#39;t realize that the stress from juggling too many activities <br/>
is getting to them. <br/>

How long were you in school, or supporting school, or being school-like?  One <br/>
month per year is the general prediction.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-480185877">Hello everybody, <br/>
<br/>
My name is Sylvie, I&#39;m french, mom of Tom, 5 years old, and Lilou, 2 years old. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a little bit difficult for me to write in english... <br/>
<br/>
Il live in France and our children never went to school and wont go. Only if they want, for the collège, maybe ?<br/>
<br/>
I read some articles from Sandra Dodd that I found passionating ! It&#39;s new for me because unschooling doesn&#39;t really exist in France. Almost everybody ignore what it means. It&#39;s difficult here, because we are controlled once a year from 6 years old to 16. <br/>
I just discovering &quot;deschooling&quot;, and it talks to me so much...<br/>
I&#39;m discovering John Holt too, and lot of books with unschooling. For me, it&#39;s like if it was a family I looked for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
I try to be like I would like to be with my children, less controling what they eat, when they sleep, what they do, etc... I really try because I felt something in me, recently, something let go... I feel inside the unschooling, but something is hard for me, the TV ! I would like to be convinced that if I let Tom look like he wants, one day he will be interested in the real life... I know that we have, as parents, to propose then a joyfull life, an interesting life. But it&#39;s not. We try to, we leave in a beautifull place now, in the mountains, they can go outside when they want, but they don&#39;t... Now that Tom is feeling we try to let go conventions, he thinks about TV all the day ! When he wake up to the evening, he could watch the TV if we let him do. And maybe we should let him do. But for the moment, we can&#39;t... <br/>
When I was a child, I watched the TV all the time. It was special, because my mother could not stand that I could do other things. She needed me to be near her watching TV.. <br/>
I think TV saved my life, really... For me, being a child was horrible, going to school was a nightmare, and TV helped me to forget this life. <br/>
<br/>
I hope my children don&#39;t feel like I felt when I was a child. I don&#39;t think so... <br/>
It&#39;s just when I think about the outside, the nature is so beautifull, and Tom prefer being in front of the TV unstead of being outside playing or running or screaming. It disturb me a lot. <br/>
Does he need to experiment the unschooling ? Does he need to go on this way entirely for going out one day ? Oh ! It&#39;s so difficult to explain in english ! Maybe you will not understand what I mean... <br/>
He&#39;s a giftes child. We had to learn to understand him for a long time. It&#39;s better now. <br/>
For the moment, I&#39;m reading &quot;The unschooling handbook&quot;, and &quot;playfull parenting&quot;. I like them. I have difficulties for playing... Certainly because I&#39;m a unique child, and noone played with me when I was a child.... I&#39;m learning again. But Tom is now so obssessed by TV that he stopped asking to play ! <br/>
<br/>
I know it&#39;s not very clear, I hope you will understand what I mean. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
<br/>

------------------<br/>
Making them go outside won&#39;t make them love being outside.  My   mom used to <br/>
say &quot;Get your head out of that book and go outside and play.&quot;   It only made <br/>
me like my mom less, and hate my yard, and wish I were far  away.  <br/>
 <br/>
-=- Now that Tom is feeling we try to let go conventions, he thinks about  TV <br/>
all the day ! =-<br/>
 <br/>
Because it was controlled before it was made valuable.<br/>
Now he&#39;s rich, and can do the valuable things all he wants to.<br/>
If you controlled it before, you&#39;re the one who declared it wonderfully big  <br/>
and important.  Let him feel rich, then.  Not only will he get tired  of it, <br/>
but in the meantime you should watch what he&#39;s watching and see what he&#39;s  <br/>
learning and why he likes the shows he likes.  You could learn a lot  too.<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe you&#39;ve already seen this:<br/>

 <br/>
Lots of moms have written about how their own beliefs changed when they  went <br/>
where their children were.  Being with our children shouldn&#39;t (can&#39;t)  always <br/>
mean making our children be where we are.  WITH them, where they  are, <br/>
sometimes means mentally, and emotionally.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-Does he need to experiment the unschooling ? Does he need to go on this  <br/>
way entirely for going out one day ?-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Everyone involved has to change their habits and beliefs and relationships  <br/>
for unschooling to work.  It seems that it would be a big job, but once you  <br/>
get started, if you change some of the principles on which you make your  other <br/>
decisions each decision starts to become easier and easier.  If peace  <br/>
outranks schedules, that helps you decide.  If joy outranks structure, that  helps.  <br/>
If learning outranks rules, that helps.<br/>
 <br/>

Maybe he&#39;s still playing in his head, though, playing with the ideas,  <br/>

<br/>
I think he is &quot;obsessed&quot; with tv right now, because he is trying to <br/>
get enough of it before you change your mind and turn it off. My son <br/>
(8 years old)has few restrictions on tv watching or <br/>
videogame/computer use (the main restriction would be if someone <br/>
else is watching/using those items)...he might go days without <br/>
playing videogames, and then do nothing (seemingly)BUT play for <br/>
days. <br/>
<br/>
The television is a pretty exciting piece of equipment, lots of fun <br/>
things to see on there. We just recently got digital cable at my <br/>
mom&#39;s house where i stay (had basic cable before that), and for <br/>
awhile i watched alot of movies. And when we got internet hooked up <br/>
here i could barely pull myself away, but after awhile the novelty <br/>
wears off. If your son knows he can watch tv whenever he wants, he <br/>
may be more willing to leave it knowing it will be there when he <br/>
comes back. Does that make sense? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-238152613">Making them go outside won&#39;t make them love being outside. <br/>
***************** But they like being outside, playing in the snow, skiing, etc... At the present, Tom now prefer staying inside and watch TV. When he was little, he liked going outside a lot, but he&#39;s not used to go by himself, because we were in an appartment, with a dangerous road. Now that he can, he doesn&#39;t. I&#39;m afraid that we &quot;broke&quot; something in him, his love for life, his enthusiasm. Lilou has it, and seing her today makes me remember that Tom was the same. <br/>
<br/>
If you controlled it before, you&#39;re the one who declared it wonderfully big  <br/>
and important.  Let him feel rich, then.  Not only will he get tired  of it, <br/>
but in the meantime you should watch what he&#39;s watching and see what he&#39;s  <br/>
learning and why he likes the shows he likes.  You could learn a lot  too.<br/>
******************************* This is what I was thinking, after reading articles on it. He likes cartoons, he&#39;s looking the same again and again... I&#39;m afraid by TV airs, for health, by my child doesn&#39;t breath fresh air, he has his eyes flowing. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lots of moms have written about how their own beliefs changed when they  went <br/>
where their children were.  Being with our children shouldn&#39;t (can&#39;t)  always <br/>
mean making our children be where we are.  WITH them, where they  are, <br/>
sometimes means mentally, and emotionally.<br/>
******************************** Yes, I just try to start to be where he is.. It&#39;s so difficult for me, because of my stress I guess... And because it makes me anxious being where the children are. I don&#39;t know why. Playing makes me anxious... <br/>
But I can understand how he feel in front on TV, because I like it too. It&#39;s like when I read a book, even better. I feel better... <br/>
<br/>
Maybe he&#39;s still playing in his head, though, playing with the ideas,  <br/>
imagining himself in those situations, wondering how the voices and animation  work.<br/>
**************** Oh ! Yes ! He&#39;s playing in his head. We can see it on his face ! <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the links, I&#39;m going to see them now. <br/>

  **Now that Tom is feeling we try to let go conventions, he thinks <br/>
  about TV all the day ! When he wake up to the evening, he could <br/>
  watch the TV if we let him do. And maybe we should let him do. But <br/>
  for the moment, we can&#39;t... **<br/>
<br/>
  I think he is &quot;obsessed&quot; with tv right now, because he is trying to <br/>
  get enough of it before you change your mind and turn it off. My son <br/>
  (8 years old)has few restrictions on tv watching or <br/>
  videogame/computer use (the main restriction would be if someone <br/>
  else is watching/using those items)...he might go days without <br/>
  playing videogames, and then do nothing (seemingly)BUT play for <br/>
  days. <br/>
<br/>
  The television is a pretty exciting piece of equipment, lots of fun <br/>
  things to see on there. We just recently got digital cable at my <br/>
  mom&#39;s house where i stay (had basic cable before that), and for <br/>
  awhile i watched alot of movies. And when we got internet hooked up <br/>
  here i could barely pull myself away, but after awhile the novelty <br/>
  wears off. If your son knows he can watch tv whenever he wants, he <br/>

<br/>
2 of my 3 seem to also focus on TV alot and I have taken Sandra&#39;s and others wisdom to keep the worry inside my head, stop &quot;trying&quot; to get them to do other things and be more with them, even when that means I am here on the computer and they are right in the same room watching TV. They tell me all kinds of things, Just now Tessa 5 said mom look at the TV, you need to know about this. She was seeing an insurance comercial. So I had a conversation about life insurance with my just turned 5 year old.<br/>
<br/>
I do know my 2 girls would rather stay in when the weather is yucky, unless it is something really grand, like to the beach, or sledding or other very special activity. My son will go out half naked when ever to dance in the street, dual with an imaginary foe, or shot some baskets in the hoop out front.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday we were all in watching a Full House Marathon, when my oldest decided to go out and play with water balloons with a friend. Go figure. We had actually put the FH marathon on the calander so we all knew, and then 2 shows into it all 3 of mine plus the friend were outside between storms getting soaking wet in their clothes or bathing suits and it was 50 degrees outside. I too was there supporting this craziness by filling and tying as fast as I could with frozen fingers. 1 hour later we were in, 2 in the bath, 2 by the fire, drying and laughing. <br/>
<br/>
Trust, relax, enjoy, and maybe get a project out so you can be with him and doing your own things too., though projects and 2 year olds have their own challenges.<br/>

Hi, Sylvie --<br/>
<br/>
Was your son in school before?  Because we talk here about a time period for &quot;deschooling&quot;, for letting all the stress of school pass away.  And during this time, a child may be passive, or very unoriginal, because he is trying to get rid of school ideas and find his own inspiration.  (You can probably find a better description on Sandra&#39;s webpages.)<br/>
<br/>
My son was never in school, and we never had significant TV restrictions, but when we moved we had poor reception which limited us to 3 clear channels and a few more that were hard to see..  Eventually we got a satellite TV service with 100 channels, some that ran cartoons all day.  There was heavy viewing here for nearly 6 months, before it tapered off.  I hadn&#39;t thought it would last so long, and it did bother me (but I didn&#39;t express that to my son).  Because we were far from our friends, and struggled to find new friends, I think the TV usage was increased.<br/>

Now I&#39;m doing like that, when I go outside, I tell them, and Tom say if he wants to come. Before that, I was deciding that we all go outside, without asking to them. It&#39;s new for me to change my mind with that. My readings help me a lot. For me now, it&#39;s normal to not force him to come with me, to ask him, but before, I didn&#39;t think about. <br/>

  When he was little, he liked going outside a lot, but he&#39;s not used to go by<br/>
  himself, because we were in an appartment, with a dangerous road. Now that<br/>
  he can, he doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  My kids are 8 and 10 and they still don&#39;t like to go out and play by<br/>
  themselves.   I can remember my mother saying, &quot;It&#39;s too nice of a day to be<br/>
  inside.  Go outside and play.&quot;  I&#39;ve never said that to my kids.  When I<br/>
  feel like we could benefit from going outside, I go outside myself and<br/>
  invite them along to do something fun.  (ski, snow shoe, go sliding, play<br/>
  baseball, walk to the farm next door, go swimming, ride the horse, etc.)<br/>
  99% of the time, they take me up on it.  Maybe you&#39;ve tried these things?<br/>

********************* No, he never went to school. But I think we put too much pressure on him, because when we knew he was a gifted child, someone from an association told me he sould never get bored, should learn to read very soon, etc... They stresses me, and I stressed him... And the controls are stressing me too. So, even if he didn&#39;t went to school, he had pressure on him, and I think he need to &quot;deschool&quot;. <br/>
