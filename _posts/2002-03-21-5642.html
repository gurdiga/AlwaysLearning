from 4 brits.<br/>
We are in the San Gabriel valley of the Los Angeles basin.  Near where<br/>
Interstate 10 and California 57 meet, about 20 miles east of LA.<br/>

<br/>
The first two week of May are &quot;open house in the<br/>
woods&quot; at our house for UNSCHOOLERS CAMP OUT.  <br/>
<br/>
There is the pristine St. Mary&#39;s river (fishing,<br/>
swimming, canoeing).  29 acres of woods (camping<br/>
hiking).  Indoor plumbing and aerated, filtered<br/>
drinking water(we have a kitchen, also).  Amelia<br/>
Island (beach, state park (Ft. Clinch)is 40 minutes<br/>
away.  Jacksonville Zoo is 40 minutes away. <br/>
Okeefeenokee Swamp (museum, boardwalk, boat rides) is<br/>
20 minutes away. <br/>
<br/>
The Florida Folk Festival is 1 hour away the second<br/>
weekend in May.<br/>
<br/>
I will make pancakes for breakfast, daily, and keep a<br/>
pot of pinto-bean chili and fresh bread handy.  <br/>
<br/>
E off list for directions from I95 near the Georgia<br/>
line in Florida!!<br/>

Hope lots of you can come.  Bring camping gear, canoe,<br/>
fishing gear (if you want to), music, shoes, bug<br/>
repellant.<br/>
