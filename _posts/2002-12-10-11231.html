Choosing the Optimystic Path in a Pessimystic World<br/>
<br/>
Dear Friends:<br/>
<br/>
         The Swami has said there are two kinds of mystics in the <br/>
world, the optimystics and the pessimystics.  Although pessimystics <br/>
seem to be more in touch with &quot;reality,&quot; optimystics are happier and <br/>
live longer.  It&#39;s the pessimystics who&#39;ve been crying, &quot;The sky is <br/>
falling, the sky is falling!&quot; The optimystics simply smile and say, <br/>
&quot;No.  It only looks that way because we are ascending.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
        Of course, for those people who read the news -- not to<br/>
mention those unfortunate enough to be in the news -- this has not<br/>
been an easy year to offer an optimystic reframe to loads of <br/>
pessimystic evidence.<br/>
 <br/>
There&#39;s an old saying, &quot;It always seems darkest before it gets really <br/>
dark,&quot; but we optimystics don&#39;t buy it.  Call me a hopeless &quot;hopium&quot; <br/>
addict, but I say it can&#39;t hurt to look on the bright side.<br/>
<br/>
         Sure, you can say we human beings have moved further down<br/>
the path of self-destruction ... or you could say the earth is<br/>
ridding itself of its most virulent parasite.  You can deplore the <br/>
increased war, disease and starvation, or you can go, &quot;Hey,<br/>
population control without birth control or abortion!&quot;  You can worry <br/>
over America&#39;s turn toward totalitarianism or you can say, &quot;Ah,<br/>
simplicity!  We&#39;ve boiled the Bill of Rights down to just one: You<br/>
have the right to remain silent.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
        Seriously, we do have a choice.  One of my favorite stories <br/>
recently is about a Native American grandfather talking to his young <br/>
grandson.  He tells the boy he has two wolves inside of him<br/>
struggling with each other. The first is the wolf of peace, love and <br/>
kindness. The other wolf is fear, greed and hatred.  &quot;Which wolf will <br/>
win, grandfather?&quot; asks the young boy.<br/>
<br/>
        &quot;Whichever one I feed,&quot; is the reply.<br/>
<br/>
        Every day -- every moment -- we have the choice to feed the <br/>
wolf of love or the wolf of fear.  If war is a necessary evil, that <br/>
makes it all the more important to express peace as a necessary good.<br/>
Whatever love, kindness, laughter, or generosity we create in our <br/>
immediate vicinity radiates outward like a &quot;perfect Ponzi scheme&quot;<br/>
where everyone wins and nobody loses.<br/>
<br/>
        The wolf I have chosen to feed is the wolf of healing<br/>
laughter and conscious comedy.  I am happy to say that I have<br/>
&quot;combined farces&quot; with producer Michael Mears (&quot;The WiseZenHeimers&quot;)<br/>
to form the Laughmore Society, a membership organization designed to <br/>
encourage laughter as a tool for healing and awakening.  We will have <br/>
our first &quot;Wake Up Laughing&quot; event in January (see attached flyer) at <br/>
Unity in Marin in Novato, California with the Swami and fellow comic <br/>
Richard Stockton (author of &quot;Fondle the Fear&quot; and master of the <br/>
reframe).  At this event, for the first time, Swami will be<br/>
delivering his annual State of the Universe Address in front of a<br/>
live audience.<br/>
 <br/>
    If you want tickets so you can be there in person and register <br/>
your personal laughter on the laugh track, just click on appearances <br/>
for details -- and you can buy your tickets online.  This event will<br/>
be recorded so you can enjoy it post-humorously, and maybe even <br/>
webcast. Watch the January newsletter for more details.<br/>

How to Spread More Good Cheer This Season<br/>
<br/>
         If you&#39;re looking for a way to help the Swami&#39;s mission to <br/>
bring good cheerfulness, here is how you can &quot;feed two birds with one <br/>
scone.&quot; First of all, Swami is making it even easier to give the gift <br/>
of laughter this season, and goodness knows, we need it!<br/>
<br/>
     *  For every $35 special (Duck Soup book, Beyondananda and Beyond<br/>
cassette, Drive Your Karma, Curb Your Dogma CD) sold between now and<br/>
December 25th, the Swami will throw in a free book, tape or CD -- your<br/>
choice.<br/>
     *  Just click on the order page, and the field that says &quot;where <br/>
did you hear about our site&quot; just specify book, tape or CD.  For the <br/>
same price, you can now have an extra stocking stuffer.  Or, keep it <br/>
yourself to enjoy.  As the old saying goes, the laugh you save may be <br/>
your own.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
         And for those who are more ambitious, you can join with <br/>
Swami&#39;s &quot;matching funs&quot; program and set up your own &quot;Duck Soup<br/>
kitchen&quot; by giving Duck Soup books to those who could most use a<br/>
laugh this holiday season.<br/>
     *  For $100 (includes shipping), we&#39;ll send you 15 books (5 free <br/>
books) for you to distribute wherever you like -- hospitals, nursing <br/>
homes, hospice, women&#39;s and homeless shelters.<br/>
     *  Or, tell us the kinds of places you&#39;d like them donated, and <br/>
we&#39;ll distribute them for you locally.<br/>
     *  For $275 (includes UPS shipping), we&#39;ll ship you a box of 62 <br/>
books (you&#39;re getting 35 books for free!) to distribute yourself (or <br/>
tell us where you want the box shipped).<br/>
     *  Just respond to this email or call Swami&#39;s toll free line at <br/>
(800) SWAMI-BE and say &quot;duck soup,&quot; and leave any pertinent <br/>
information.<br/>
<br/>
         And finally, for this holiday season when things get hectic, <br/>
when family patterns erupt, or when an overdose of holiday &quot;cheer&quot;<br/>
has gotten you down, get quiet, take a deep breath and remember<br/>
Swami&#39;s holiday song, &quot;There&#39;s No Place Like OM For the Holidays.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
         Till next year, may you wake up laughing .. and leave<br/>
laughter in your wake.<br/>
<br/>
    May the FARCE be with you,<br/>
