<br/>
This thing used to happen at our house.  My mother would flatter about<br/>
something &quot;oh you&#39;ve fixed your hair so nice&quot; and then to my sister she<br/>
would say about me, &quot;the little fool&quot;.  It happened with everyone, you<br/>
were in on her joke at the expense of a sibling or you were the butt of<br/>
one.  To this day I think people are secretly ridiculing me if they pay<br/>
me a compliment.  It&#39;s not the worst thing in the world and it surely<br/>
hasn&#39;t ruined me, but I think all the time about how nice it would be not<br/>
to have that in my head at all.   I really like the idea of all these<br/>
kids growing up without all that embarrassment and shame.  I like that<br/>
these parents don&#39;t make their kids feel like fools.   <br/>
<br/>
So, good for you.<br/>
