house. (well, we have had season 1 for a while now, but season 2 took <br/>
forever!) Darin gets his sci-fi kick and I get Richard Dean Anderson and <br/>
Michael Shanks. What a great way to fall asleep! (my own personal bedtime <br/>
story!) <br/>

nothing better to do than cram our email with talk of hot lusty men! &lt;eg&gt;<br/>
