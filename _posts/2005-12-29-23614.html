<div id="ygrps-yiv-1136677322">After reading more posts -- I feel the need to add - I&#39;ve lent money, Russ  <br/>
(dad) has come up with cars - we support the kids with love and whatever else <br/>
we  can come up with -- that the kids need.<br/>
 <br/>
Yes, we charge rent.  When Devin lived here(working  construction) and made <br/>
way more than I do (after the divorce and all that),  I felt he could help pay <br/>
for the food he was eating.  Yes, I had been  paying before he was 18, but I <br/>
was often down to my last actual few dollars, and  needed the money.  I could <br/>
see that after they were older, and contributing  to the costs of the house <br/>
they seemed to take more responsibilty for wasting  less, and being more aware.<br/>
 <br/>
By giving the kids a personal and clothing allowance usually they had more  <br/>
spending money than I have.  But I didn&#39;t want to change that after the  <br/>
divorce, because it would be one more important thing that got changed.  We  decided <br/>
to end it at 18, because we were trying to be &quot;fair&quot; to each of the five  <br/>
kids.  Of the four that are over 18, they have all been extremely able in  the <br/>
handling of their life decisions and in their money stuff.  It has  worked well <br/>
in our family.  If I had more money, would I give them more as  they are older <br/>
- you betcha&#39;!  I hope I get to that point.  But they  understand now that <br/>
I&#39;m trying to establish a life where I won&#39;t be on the  street myself in my <br/>
&quot;old&quot; age. <br/>
