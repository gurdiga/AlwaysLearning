<div id="ygrps-yiv-1394724627">We are going to a park day today.  We have a new influx of families in our homeschool group, so I&#39;ll be meeting some of these moms face to face for the first time.  Previously, our park days have been all kids playing together and also moving in and out of groups of 2 or more according to who was doing what, not age or sex.  They aren&#39;t all unschoolers, but plenty are &quot;relaxed&quot; homeschoolers, which is much easier to find common ground with than the school-at-homers.<br/>
