Any plans to write a book?  The message boards and yahoogroups are great, but I love sitting down with a book.  I also periodically send books to my ex-husband and he has actually read them.  This time I&#39;m sending him The Unprocessed Child.  I&#39;ve often thought someone should take all those posts off the old lists and put them in a huge book.  I know my ex-husband and friends will read books I lend them, but they won&#39;t spend time on the internet researching and reading at the message boards.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone?<br/>
