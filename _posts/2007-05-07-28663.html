<div id="ygrps-yiv-507097860">I&#39;ve enjoyed reading this thread about tv advertising and its effects. <br/>
The basic question seems to be whether we (and our kids) are critical <br/>
media observers or not. If we&#39;re not, then our kids probably won&#39;t be <br/>
and may fall vulnerable to big business marketing tactics. <br/>
<br/>
But, aside from the possibility that many people believe they are more <br/>
resistant to big business marketing tactics than they really are (and <br/>
there is some interesting evidence on this), there seems to be a total <br/>
absence of class analysis in this thread. I think we need to more <br/>
sensitively take into account that the vast majority of the u.s. <br/>
population (those who are working class to poor working class) are more <br/>
vulnerable to big business marketing campaigns than the privileged few <br/>
(let&#39;s say 20% or so), not because they lack the capacities for <br/>
critical analysis but because they lack the luxury of time and energy <br/>
to exercise these capacities. Come home after working a 12 hour labor-<br/>
intensive day (or two labor-intensive jobs) and see how open you are to <br/>
critiquing the content of what you&#39;re watching on television. I&#39;ve done <br/>
this, and the effect of tv when I&#39;m exhausted, tired, and stressed is <br/>
to lull me into an uncritical stupor. If I&#39;m in an uncritical stupor, <br/>
how can I engage my children into open dialogue and critical <br/>
questioning about big-business marketing tactics?<br/>
<br/>
If interested, Michael Dawson in his book The Consumer Trap has a lot <br/>
to say about the &quot;class warfare&quot; inherent in corporate marketing, as, <br/>
of course, do Chomsky/Herman in Manufacturing Consent. <br/>

kids who become critical thinkers because parents are present *with*  <br/>
their children: paying attention to what they say and what they do,  <br/>
talking about life with them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Unschoolers?<br/>
<br/>
Not because we&#39;re superior and are immune to every negative  <br/>
factor ;-) (though I think respecting kids cuts the odds *way* *way*  <br/>
down ), but because it&#39;s very useful to realize that studies are done  <br/>
on huge chunks of the population that is *also* subjected to school  <br/>
and conventional parenting and, for a large segment, families with  <br/>
two working parents or at least parents that aren&#39;t fully involved in  <br/>
their children&#39;s lives the way unschoolers are. Those factors do have  <br/>
an effect on people that can&#39;t be subtracted out. The results are  <br/>
assumed to apply to &quot;people&quot; but they really apply to people who have  <br/>
been forced to spend 12 years being told that what they want isn&#39;t as  <br/>
important as what the experts around them say they should want.<br/>
<br/>
Why wouldn&#39;t that have a profound effect on who they are and the  <br/>
choices they make?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; there seems to be a total<br/>
&gt; absence of class analysis in this thread.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because we&#39;re talking about unschooling and the effects of limiting  <br/>
our children&#39;s world not the effect of TV on (conventional) people.<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s also useful to realize that studies don&#39;t show the effects  <br/>
that happen to a *person*. They show trends over a mass of people.  <br/>
The trends say nothing useful about how an individual will react.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s way more useful to look at our kids as unique individuals and  <br/>
see what *they* need. (Which is so easy it&#39;s hard for people with  <br/>
massive number of scripts in their heads about what kids should do  <br/>
and should be like.)<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s really the purpose unschooling lists serve. While it&#39;s  <br/>
easy to list the principles of unschooling, helping people figure out  <br/>
how that works for their circumstances is a huge chunk of the  <br/>
information that passes through the list. (Though ultimately it&#39;s  <br/>
about helping people get rid of the other influences -- like control  <br/>
and comparing kids and looking towards school and fear of letting  <br/>
kids experience life before they&#39;re full of the &quot;facts&quot; of what life  <br/>
is really like -- that are interfering with unschooling.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Come home after working a 12 hour labor-<br/>
&gt; intensive day (or two labor-intensive jobs) and see how open you  <br/>
&gt; are to<br/>
&gt; critiquing the content of what you&#39;re watching on television.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And how likely is it they&#39;ll be unschooling their kids? If they don&#39;t  <br/>
have time to attend to their kids then the kids would be better off  <br/>
in school.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If I&#39;m in an uncritical stupor,<br/>
&gt; how can I engage my children into open dialogue and critical<br/>
&gt; questioning about big-business marketing tactics?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>To unschool people need to find a way not to be in an &quot;uncritical  <br/>
stupor&quot; or unschooling won&#39;t work. Moms with 3 kids under 6 can find  <br/>
themselves in a state of exhausted stupor for quite some time but it  <br/>
*does* pass and there are lots of moms here who have been through  <br/>
that and can share what helped them during those years.<br/>
<br/>
And &quot;open dialogue and critical questioning&quot; isn&#39;t that hard to do --  <br/>
as long as someone isn&#39;t in a stupor. No one needs to turn it into a  <br/>
big production -- like a lesson! It&#39;s just casual talk: &quot;Boy we  <br/>
should get some of that detergent! It sure makes people happy!&quot;  <br/>
*Trust* that kids will see the ridiculousness of that without us  <br/>
having to explain why it&#39;s untrue. We don&#39;t need to tell them what  <br/>
they need to look for. We just need to be aware and interested in  <br/>
life -- and *not* in a stupor.<br/>

Perhaps I was being a bit too indirect in my previous post about lack <br/>
of class perspective on this listserv. To be clear, my interests are <br/>
not only in unschooling myself and my own children -- an immediate goal <br/>
that is supported and inspired by this listserv -- but also to develop <br/>
a vision (not a &quot;goal&quot;) for working toward an unschooled society. And <br/>
developing such a vision, a vision of a country full of critical, <br/>
creative, self-reliant problem- solvers, a nation full of participatory <br/>
citizens, requires a broad-based class analysis. <br/>
<br/>
What percentage of the U.S. population is in a position to unschool <br/>
their children if they wanted to? What percentage of the population <br/>
cannot unschool their children because they have to work all day (and a <br/>
good part of the night) outside the home to pay the bills and put food <br/>
on the table? How can we organize to alleviate this situation? How can <br/>
those of us who are in a position to do so network and organize to <br/>
develop supportive communities for unschooling children of parents who <br/>
have no choice but to work outside the home?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, we should not be zombies at night. But we have the luxury to say <br/>
this. How can we use our privileged positions to better educational <br/>
opportunities in our communities and ultimately society at large?<br/>
<br/>
Please forgive me: I am new to this listserv. But I am wondering if <br/>
these and related questions are of interest to other people in this <br/>
community. Thanks for all your thoughtful posts! I really do like this <br/>
site a lot. <br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s okay.<br/>
<br/>
All topics need to come back toward how those who choose to come to  <br/>
this list can unschool their children more clearly and peacefully.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Come home after working a 12 hour labor-<br/>

<br/>
Someone who has to work two jobs is probably not unschooling, and so  <br/>
that&#39;s not an unschooling situation.<br/>
<br/>
-=-If I&#39;m in an uncritical stupor,<br/>
how can I engage my children into open dialogue and critical<br/>
questioning about big-business marketing tactics?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Not everyone has a sailboat.  How much of a sailboat discussion list  <br/>
should be dedicated to worry and shame about people who don&#39;t own  <br/>
sailboats?<br/>
<br/>
Because I unschooled (and others, but for a moment this is me,  <br/>
talking just about me)---because I unschooled and because I shared  <br/>
that out on lists such as this one (there&#39;ve been others, and message  <br/>
boards and newsgroups over the years), and because I&#39;ve written  <br/>
articles for local newsletters and then branched out, and spoke at a  <br/>
local conference and then was invited elsewhere, then others have  <br/>
been braver and more confident about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Because I did that because I wanted to and I could, then others found  <br/>
they wanted to and could.  Or they could and found they could do it  <br/>
better.  Or the could and decided they wanted to.<br/>
<br/>
If a sailboat had never been invented until the political (and  <br/>
geographical!?  I&#39;m over 5,000 feet above sealevel, 1000 miles from  <br/>
flat water, not counting Elephant Butte Lake and Abiquiu Lake)  <br/>
situation allowed for every family to have a sailboat, it just  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be a question.   Sailboats wouldn&#39;t exist.<br/>
<br/>
Should I not unschool because not everyone wants to?  Because not  <br/>
everyone can?<br/>
Should I not let my kids have seconds at dinner because not everyone  <br/>
will let theirs?  Because not everyone has enough?<br/>
Should I not let my kids watch TV because not everyone is analytical?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-189905223">Are you saying that people are fooled into buying things that don&#39;t  <br/>
live up to the advertising hype? Or manipulated into the wanting of  <br/>
things, in the first place? Fooled how?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t find myself or my family to be wide open to being fooled and  <br/>
I really do think we&#39;re too smart to be fooled. We&#39;re skeptics, but  <br/>
not cynics. There are great things out there that, yes, are  <br/>
advertised - like my pink cell phone which I got because it is pretty  <br/>
and I enjoy that aspect of it. Was I tricked by advertising into  <br/>
thinking it is pretty? Sheesh - what a miserably cynical view of life  <br/>
that is.<br/>
<br/>
Kids&#39; expectations are sometimes too high for something they&#39;ve seen  <br/>
advertised. But it doesn&#39;t take more than a couple of experiences for  <br/>
them to be more realistic about what they&#39;re likely to get, compared  <br/>
to what they see in an ad.<br/>
<br/>
Marketing lets us know what is out there and so people, of course,  <br/>
buy more of things that are &quot;marketed.&quot; That&#39;s just awareness, not  <br/>
manipulating or trickery.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re talking bigger picture, the idea that we&#39;re all fooled into  <br/>
thinking that we need more &quot;stuff&quot; in order to be happy, I don&#39;t buy  <br/>
&lt;beg&gt; that either. We buy stuff that DOES add to our enjoyment of  <br/>
life, but we don&#39;t think the stuff is what will make us happy,  <br/>
overall. It is a basic human characteristic to want more stuff,  <br/>
Madison Avenue didn&#39;t put that natural desire into human beings.<br/>

<br/>
As to direct or indirect,  the purpose of this list is to talk about  <br/>
unschooling.  Tell us about your own unschooling life first and  <br/>
foremost, and if other stories and topics fit into those reports, great.<br/>

I live in a cul-de-sac.  I can&#39;t even inspire the other three  <br/>
families with children to unschool, and I don&#39;t have time, and it  <br/>
would piss them off.  The grandchildren of one of the women are  <br/>
homeschooled.  I&#39;ve seen them a couple of times.  The boys wear  <br/>
overalls and the girls wear knee-length dresses with long sleeves  <br/>
(little house on the prairie kind of stuff).   They&#39;re not  <br/>
unschooled.  They&#39;re some kind of fundamentalist Christian 19th- <br/>
century-worshipping structured homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
If you spend your time, thought and energy on emptying the ocean with  <br/>
a thimble, you will have no time and energy to spend with your own  <br/>
children.   If you spend your time and energy on your children, you  <br/>
might find a way to understand a LOT more about the ocean, and  <br/>
thimbles, and the movement of water, and what would have happened had  <br/>
you emptied that ocean anyway...<br/>

If we spend out lives vainly trying to improve the world, we won&#39;t be  <br/>

I&#39;ve been unschooling since my nearly-21-year-old son was five years  <br/>

in town, but my dad couldn&#39;t afford it.  I wanted more books, but my  <br/>
dad couldn&#39;t afford them.  I wanted braces, but my dad couldn&#39;t  <br/>
afford them.  My kids have had braces (two of them; one opted out and  <br/>
we let him) and books and unschooling, not because I coudln&#39;t think  <br/>
of anything else to do with my &quot;privilege,&quot; but because it was my  <br/>
priority to give my children a better life than I had.<br/>

democratic perspectives but very few to discuss unschooling and  <br/>
natural learning in a pure and applied form.<br/>
<br/>
Zak, your next post should probably be to tell us about your own  <br/>
unschooling life.<br/>

If you want to *ask* people to join you on a separate list to help  <br/>
with your vision of bringing unschooling to the world, hey, it&#39;s  <br/>
possible Sandra might let that through. I wish you luck. (And hope  <br/>
your wife is the one unschooling the kids while you&#39;re off saving the  <br/>
world.) (Do note that John Holt also devoted his life to it, wrote  <br/>
several books and had a magazine to spread the word about unschooling  <br/>
-- *and* didn&#39;t have children who needed him. And yet how far did he  <br/>
get for his efforts? Changing the world is a *huge* task and takes  <br/>
talent, time and devotion. Guilt is not a substitute for those.)<br/>
<br/>
But to suggest that those who have the privilege to unschool have  <br/>
some obligation to those who can&#39;t (because of finances or ignorance)  <br/>
is emotional manipulation.<br/>

I&#39;m in the process of helping develop a network of unschoolers in my <br/>

limited resources is a pretty familiar topic on various boards - <br/>
unschoolers *want* to form networks, so we do, whenever possible.<br/>

option - either legally or financially or that they have the <br/>
*ability* to homeschool their kids, much less unschool. And yet at <br/>
the same time there are unschoolers on welfare, unschoolers with no <br/>
fixed address due to hardship, unschoolers who are battling abusive <br/>
ex-spouses for custody and the right to unschool. Finances and <br/>
hardship alone don&#39;t account for people keeping kids in schools. <br/>
There are a lot of myths about the &quot;necessity&quot; of education, and <br/>
there are a lot of myths about homeschooling that contribute to the <br/>
lack of awareness of this option.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to help break down the myths and stereotypes that exist <br/>
around home/unschooling, tell more people you home/unschool. Really. <br/>
Its also a good way to network, btw. Last night I met another <br/>
homeschooling mom at a book club and we ended up exchanging email <br/>
addresses and making tentative plans to get our kids together. <br/>
That&#39;s the third or fourth time I&#39;ve met another homeschooler irl by <br/>
this kind of &quot;direct action&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Are you saying the &quot;capacity for critical analysis&quot; is somehow <br/>
different from the negotiating, problem solving, advance-planning, <br/>
and generally thinking out of the box that unschooling families <br/>
engage in regularly just by dint of stepping away from rules and <br/>
striving to live more peacefully?<br/>
<br/>
Life isn&#39;t divided into subjects, but you seem to be thinking <br/>
about &quot;dealing with advertising&quot; as something separate from the rest <br/>
of living.<br/>
<br/>
Its tough to be a creative, thoughtful, engaged parent when I&#39;m <br/>
tired. Its alot easier to make poor judgements and have knee-jerk <br/>
reactions. But part of being and unschooler means I&#39;m working on <br/>
that - learning new skills, new ways of thinking, different ways of <br/>
managing my time and energy, and getting help when I need it, so <br/>
that I *can* be the thoughtful, engaged parent I want to be. <br/>
<br/>
My kids see me learning those skills and benefit from that process. <br/>
They get to experience a more generally thoughful family environment <br/>
than...well, more thoughtful than what *I* grew up with, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
*One* way they get to experience that has to do with advertising. <br/>
For example, I don&#39;t respond to &quot;that looks really cool&quot; with &quot;well, <br/>
you&#39;re not getting it&quot; or &quot;you don&#39;t really want that&quot;. I start with <br/>
something like: &quot;it does look cool, doesn&#39;t it&quot; and go from there. <br/>
Maybe we&#39;ll end up getting whatever it is, or something similar but <br/>
less costly, and maybe we won&#39;t, but I don&#39;t start the conversation <br/>
with a knee-jerk &quot;no&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Learning how to have those kinds of conversations with kids and how <br/>
to overcome those knee-jerk &quot;nos&quot; is an important part of what <br/>
happens on this board and other unschooling boards. We can tell our <br/>
stories and get feedback. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If I&#39;m in an uncritical stupor, <br/>
&gt; how can I engage my children into open dialogue and critical <br/>
&gt; questioning about big-business marketing tactics?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How old are your kids and how long have y&#39;all been unschooling? Are <br/>
you at home with the kids? If you&#39;re not right there with them every <br/>
day, that may be why you are seeing &quot;dealing with advertising&quot; as <br/>
something separate from the daily details of living with other <br/>
people. <br/>
<br/>
If you are so tired as to be &quot;in an uncritical stupor&quot; you&#39;re <br/>
unlikely to have open dialog or critical questioning about <br/>
toothbrushing, the mess in the living room, or who&#39;s turn it is to <br/>
sit in the front seat of the car, let alone advertising. That&#39;s <br/>
going to impact your relationship with your kids. I&#39;d suggest <br/>
finding ways to not end up in an uncritical stupor very often - <br/>
perhaps you need to find a job closer to home, or with more flexible <br/>
hours. Perhaps you need to be sure to eat more protein - some nuts <br/>
in the car on the way home, for example. Hard to say without some <br/>
more details. <br/>

I imagine lots of folks think in *no other choice* mode, though not often<br/>
&#39;round here... the difference between unschoolers and those with *no other<br/>
choice* is perspective.  There are always other choices, there are<br/>
alwaysother ways.  The place to have the discussion about what&#39;s<br/>
possible is right<br/>
here it&#39;s what we do.  We&#39;re not placing ourselves in boxes called income<br/>
brackets, we&#39;re in the wide open space of choices.<br/>
<br/>
The very best networking available is at unschooling conferences/get<br/>
togethers.  Conferences can be traveled to on next to nothing (in some cases<br/>
it&#39;s pb&js and room sharing), registration fees can be waived by<br/>
volunteering.  Conference directories address the option of hosting<br/>
unschoolers; get in your car and hang out with another family (or three!) on<br/>
an inspirational road trip.  I do it often! Hayden and I just returned from<br/>
three weeks away from home, surrounded by like-minded folks!  We&#39;re still<br/>
glowing :)  I&#39;m in good practice, having had consistent support and recent<br/>
inspiration.<br/>

My privilege is my wisdom, the scales being removed from my eyes, if you<br/>

<h4>Bob Collier</h4>
<time> 8 May 2007, at  1:43am</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-694146446">Recently, I was at a website advertising a &#39;positive thinking&#39; e-book <br/>
written by somebody I&#39;d never heard of (not hard these days, there <br/>
are so many wannabes on the internet). <br/>
<br/>
The sales letter was particularly interesting. It was a very long <br/>
page. Research has shown that as a website visitor scrolls down a <br/>
long page on their computer screen the likely effect is that their <br/>
brain waves will slow down and the person reading the page will go <br/>
from normal alertness into a light trance. Without noticing. The same <br/>
as we can go into a light trance when passively watching a TV <br/>
programme. If we&#39;ve been surfing the web, the chances are we&#39;re <br/>
already in a light trance when we arrive at the website. Internet <br/>
marketers know this.<br/>
<br/>
When our brain waves are slowed down and we&#39;re in a trance <br/>
(a &#39;buying trance&#39;, the marketing gurus call it), we&#39;re susceptible <br/>
to hypnotic suggestion. And this sales letter in question was not, in <br/>
fact, a sales letter - as in, here&#39;s the product, here&#39;s how it will <br/>
benefit you and why I think you should buy it. The sales page was a <br/>
disguised hypnosis script. <br/>
<br/>
The purpose of the opening part of the sales letter was to make me <br/>
feel depressed. I don&#39;t have the letter here to refer to, but it was <br/>
essentially a guided imagery session. Exactly like a hypnotherapist <br/>
might use with a client, only this had a negative intent. &quot;I wonder <br/>
if you&#39;ve ever noticed how tired you feel at the end of the day.&quot; <br/>
This is like saying &quot;I wonder if you&#39;ve ever thought of a white cat.&quot; <br/>
Chances are, you have now. &quot;Perhaps there is something in your life <br/>
that&#39;s not quite right.&quot; And that &quot;something&quot; would be what? Whatever <br/>
you think of. Absolutely anything that you perceive as &quot;not quite <br/>
right&quot; in your personal experience.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the way the letter went on; and then it gets to the part where <br/>
you&#39;ve hopefully recalled into your awareness (without realising it) <br/>
some of the undoubtedly millions of little things that have &#39;gone <br/>
wrong&#39; in your life, and you&#39;re thinking, without really knowing <br/>
why, &quot;Well, maybe my life isn&#39;t so great at the moment.&quot; The next <br/>
part is to ramp up your negative thoughts to Chicken Little <br/>
proportions by relating them to the bigger picture. &quot;There&#39;s so much <br/>
depression in the world today. Latest research shows that teen <br/>
suicides are up by 400% over the past ten years ...&quot; and so on. <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re Zig Ziglar, or somebody like him, all of this so far will <br/>
have bounced off you. But you&#39;re not in the target market. If you&#39;re <br/>
in the target market, you should be feeling a bit low right now. <br/>
That&#39;s the intention.    <br/>
<br/>
Then comes the &#39;solution&#39; to your &#39;problem&#39;. This guy&#39;s e-book. Only <br/>
it&#39;s not offering you relief from how you felt before marketing let <br/>
you know the book was out there; it&#39;s offering you relief from how <br/>
the marketing itself made you feel.<br/>
<br/>
Marketing gurus talk about these &#39;black hat&#39; techniques behind closed <br/>
doors - NLP, covert hypnosis and so on - at $5,000 a ticket seminars.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to really know how effective they are, because the gurus <br/>
puff them up to sell the tickets to their seminars in the first <br/>
place. NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming) is regularly touted as a <br/>
skill that will give you the power to hypnotise anyone into doing <br/>
anything without them realising what&#39;s going on, as if all you have <br/>
to do is the equivalent of dangling a watch in somebody&#39;s face and <br/>
they&#39;re immediately at your bidding. Real hypnotists will tell you it <br/>
doesn&#39;t work like that. But it does work. And everybody can be <br/>
hypnotised. Even people who are certain they can&#39;t be.<br/>

&gt;&gt;from normal alertness into a light trance.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hey! That&#39;s what happened when I was reading your post &lt;g&gt;...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;The same<br/>
&gt;&gt;as we can go into a light trance when passively watching a TV<br/>
&gt;&gt;programme.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For me, I am VERY aware of what happens to me when I am watching TV (whether<br/>
it be passive watching or active watching). The reason I know what happens<br/>
to me is because I care that much about my time and my time with my family.<br/>
I conscientiously checked in with myself every few minutes when watching TV<br/>
with my kids to make sure I was with *them*, and not just pacifying myself.<br/>
I did this because I made a choice to unschool, and a lifelong choice to put<br/>
my relationships in my family above all else. I made this decision when I<br/>
was pregnant with my first child. At that time, I did not have two sticks to<br/>
rub together and would have been considered living &quot;in poverty&quot;. That went<br/>
up and down over the years, but my commitment to being aware and conscious<br/>
with my kids never did.<br/>
<br/>
Does that mean that I never get fully immerged in a show and shut the world<br/>
out a bit? No, I do that sometimes, but only with consciousness, a decision<br/>
made depending on the circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Internet<br/>

awareness. We haven&#39;t needed anyone to tell us. It&#39;s something that is<br/>
easily figured out from conscious living.<br/>
<br/>
I overheard my 17 yo ds saying to a friend, &quot;I don&#39;t have email or myspace.<br/>
I noticed that I just sit there and zone out and it just feels like a waste<br/>
of time&quot;. 15 yo dd goes on the internet maybe 2 or 3 times a week these<br/>
days, after many hours each day for a while. 18 yo ds gets on a few times a<br/>
week. 13 yo ds spends most of his internet time finding cheats for video<br/>
games and is really into You Tube right now. They&#39;ve figured out this stuff<br/>
from their own experience.<br/>

&gt;&gt;benefit you and why I think you should buy it. The sales page was a<br/>
&gt;&gt;disguised hypnosis script.&lt;&lt;<br/>

unschool so my time can be focused on kids who&#39;s parents aren&#39;t choosing to<br/>
be with their kids.  I hope to inspire parents to take responsibility for<br/>
their own children first, then others&#39; when/if we can.  Lists such as this<br/>
one do that, we speak from experience to others who have made the same<br/>
commitment to a principle-driven existence.  Anyone can come here and hear<br/>
