Redwall, maybe!  Animals ninjas (kind of, not really; &lt;g&gt;  medieval- <br/>
themed, animal characters, castles and all that, but not humans).<br/>

<br/>
My son is 8 and these are some books he&#39;s really enjoyed: <br/>
<br/>
# anything by Andy Griffiths (very funny, and sometimes quite rude!)<br/>
# All the Morris Gleitzman books (funny and very &#39;boy&#39; orientated although I think girls like him too)<br/>
# anything by Paul Jennings<br/>
# The two series that Paul Jennings and Morris Gleitzman wrote together: Wicked! and Deadly! (both are a little scary in some parts but things get resolved well in them and they move fairly quickly so there&#39;s not alot of time to dwell on the scary bits)<br/>
# The Narnia books<br/>
# Extreme Adventures books by Justin D&#39;Arth (Shark Bait is his favourite so far. Very adventurous and thrilling and very fast moving).<br/>
# Hitler&#39;s Daughter by Jackie French (we&#39;ve just started reading her books, many of which are historical fiction)<br/>
# The Indian in The Cupboard series by Lynne Reid-Banks<br/>
# Roald Dahl - he&#39;s loved all of his books<br/>
# The Dragonology books - I think we&#39;ve got nearly all of them<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s lots more which I can&#39;t think of right now but they are probably his most favourites. Lewi also hasn&#39;t gotten into Harry Potter like I thought he might. They&#39;re all so very different.<br/>
<br/>
Happy reading!<br/>
<br/>
Kim<br/>

Oh right!  Well received read-alouds here.<br/>
<br/>
Shel Silverstein poems went over well with the boys.  Holly preferred  <br/>
Robert Louis Stevenson, poetically speaking.<br/>
<br/>
Dr. Seuss is good for any age--not the beginning readers, but the  <br/>
philosophical stuff.  Yertle the Turtle, Sneetches, Horton Hatches  <br/>
the Egg.<br/>
<br/>
For reading people to sleep,  books without pictures are usually best.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-401641264">I don&#39;t have sons &lt;g&gt; but right now I&#39;m reading Freckles by Gene <br/>
Stratton Porter to my girls and they&#39;re enjoying it very much.  When <br/>
we&#39;re through with it, I&#39;m thinking of reading By the Great Horn Spoon <br/>
by Sid Flieshman (sp?) which is the book the Disney movie Bullwhip <br/>
Griffin is based on.<br/>
<br/>
Those are the two that came to mind first. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-966092942">Try Hank the Cowdog....if he likes the format then there will be 25 more to<br/>
choose from!<br/>
<br/>
James Herriott (All Creatures Great and Small) might be &quot;too advanced&quot;  but<br/>
if you are reading, then perhaps both can enjoy and you can always discuss.<br/>
I don&#39;t think the subject matter is any more complicated than, say, Tom<br/>
Sawyer.  Lots of laughs, lots of animals.   I would do #1 and/or #4 (All<br/>
Creatures or The Lord God Made..) since the middle two might be more<br/>
interesting to an older child or adult.  Many of the chapters will function<br/>
as &quot;stand-alone&quot;  stories so don&#39;t be frightened by the length.<br/>
<br/>
The Great Brain series (J.D. Fitzgerald, with Mercer Mayer illustrations)<br/>
is, in my opinion, perfect read-aloud for a 10 year old boy with the added<br/>
advantage that *you* could enjoy them too.  Some pathos and drama  but<br/>
little that is &quot;scary&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
If he likes historical or past settings that have young boys as a main<br/>
character, then you might try Johnny Tremaine, Rifles for Watie, or Across<br/>
Five Aprils.  That last one is by Irene Hunt who has several &quot;juvenile&quot;<br/>
books that do *not* follow the idea that books for children need to be silly<br/>
and watered down.    My favorite by Hunt is probably No Promises in the<br/>
Wind.<br/>
<br/>
Black Stallion series was a good recommendation.  Pretty formulaic but<br/>
plenty of horses and plenty of adventure.<br/>
<br/>
Any of the Ben K. Greene books or the Ralph Moody Little Britches series<br/>
lend themselves to segmented reading.  They have a long common thread but<br/>
can be read like a collection of short stories.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think it nice when &quot;read-aloud&quot;  books are interesting for the person<br/>
reading as well as for the audience :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-821652259">I&#39;m usually a lurker here, but I just had to respond to this post <br/>
because our family loves books and reading.  By the way, I&#39;m Susan <br/>
and my husband, son, and I live in Tennessee.  We&#39;ve been unschooling <br/>
since my son was five.  That&#39;s when I discovered John Holt, John <br/>
Taylor Gatto, Grace Llewellyn, found Sandra&#39;s website, and read The <br/>
Unschooling Handbook.  There&#39;s a huge homeschooling community in our <br/>
small town, but we are the only unschoolers I personally know. That&#39;s <br/>
why I love this group.<br/>
<br/>
My son is 9, he also doesn&#39;t like Harry Potter but loves <br/>
animals/wilderness books.  He&#39;s an avid reader, mostly poultry <br/>
magazines and catalogs and anything non-fiction, but we always have <br/>
a &quot;chapter&quot; book going that I read to him.  Right now we&#39;re reading <br/>
Julie of the Wolves and The Far Side of the Mountain (the sequel to <br/>
My Side of the Mountain - also a great movie) both by Jean Craighead <br/>
George.  I love these books because of their unschooling flavor: kids <br/>
going out on their own, pursuing their interests, and learning <br/>
through real-world experience.<br/>
<br/>
We also love anything by Kate DiCamillo.  Besides Because of Winn-<br/>
Dixie, she has written some other great books like Tiger Rising, The <br/>
Tale of Despereaux (no ninjas but it&#39;s set in a castle) and The <br/>
Adventures of Edward Tulane.<br/>
<br/>
My son really enjoyed two books by Meindert Dejong.  Along Came a Dog <br/>
sparked an interest in chickens which led to his own flock and full <br/>
scale egg business which is doing great.  The book Shadrach got my <br/>
son interested in rabbits - we now have 10 at our house!<br/>
<br/>
Hope these suggestions help!<br/>

<br/>
49 more, there are 50 in all so far!  The author, John Erickson, came to Alamogordo a few years ago.  My sister-in-law was the head of the local school for the blind, and one of the kids just LOVED Hank the Cowdog stories, and asked her if she could get the author to come to the school.  And she did!  <br/>
<br/>
We got to go too, he talked about how he started writing, about how he came up with the idea for Hank (a real dog he knew), and then he read from one of his books (#42).  <br/>
<br/>
He was really great with the kids, and spent extra time with the boy who requested that he come.<br/>
<br/>
I have been wanting to get some of the books on CD, because hearing the author read them was incredible!  They are really funny books.  <br/>
<br/>
My 12yo boy&#39;s favorite books are the Wayside School stories by Louis Sachar, they are hilarious.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1513505685">my son is 10 and really enjoys the Childhood of Famous American books.  He likes to see how famous people started out as kids and how lots of them had rough lives, different family situations, interest etc.  and how they made things work out for themselves.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-164152627">My son loves the Hitchhiker Guide to the Galaxy series and also the Artemus<br/>
Fowl series.  The Hitchhiker&#39;s guide is available on cd read by the author.<br/>
He was a very funny reader.  Also available as a radio drama that aired on<br/>
BBC radio 20 years ago - still funny.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2014319809">&quot;Hank the Cowdog&quot; b John Erickson series is great!  My hubby read these to the boys with great character voices for each dog.  We were disappointed with the author&#39;s rendition of his own work! LOL<br/>
<br/>
I think there are like almost 100 Cowdog books.....we&#39;ve never found them all, but they sure are great!  My boys were 4, 8 and 12 at the time and each child LOVED them in their own way.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1812488972">We adore Hank!  There are 50 of them and we have read them all!!  A couple of years ago we drove to Tucson, AZ and purposely went through Ochiltree County, TX and the town where John Erickson lives.  We took my son&#39;s picture in front of the Ochiltree County sign holding up his stuffed Hank and Drover!  We are huge fans!!<br/>
