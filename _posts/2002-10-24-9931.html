<div id="ygrps-yiv-331572528">Yeah, my husband looks like a person.....what does<br/>
YOURS look like?  :P<br/>
<br/>
Actually though, we hear a lot about how remarkably<br/>
like David Duchovney (Fox Mulder from X-Files) he<br/>
looks.  We have an X-Files video that the kids call<br/>
&quot;the Daddy show.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s funny is that my husband has grown a beard<br/>
(although a short one, so you can still see the<br/>
contours of his face pretty well), he also has taken<br/>
to wearing glasses more, to give his eyes a break from<br/>
the contacts.  So the other day we were trading in our<br/>
van for a spiffy new truck and the finance guy was<br/>
really fun.  He was cracking all kinds of jokes while<br/>
we were signing the papers, and he had to offer us all<br/>
the extra insurance and stuff that he is required to<br/>
offer.  Then he made a crack about calling my husband<br/>
David, and that I must have been a big X-Files fan and<br/>
that was why I married him.  I was really surprised<br/>
because of the beard and glasses.  But I guess he<br/>
still looks enough like him for it to be obvious to<br/>
some people who have memories for faces.<br/>
