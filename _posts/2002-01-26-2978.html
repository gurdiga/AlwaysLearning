<div id="ygrps-yiv-3832158">Speaking of handwriting samples...<br/>
I found a book at Barnes and Noble (forgive me if I already told you guys <br/>
this)<br/>
that has handwriting samples and analysis of many famous people. From <br/>
Beethoven to Bundy, this book is amazing! I thought it would be cool to <br/>
upload some of the published samples.<br/>
Interesting analysis on one of the serial killers. It even had Curt Cobain&#39;s <br/>
suicide letter, which made me get teary...it was so sad.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve gone and ticked people off at the unschooling.com board again, can&#39;t <br/>
seem to help myself, sheesh! Any new members from there? haha<br/>

<br/>
If you cross your eyes a lot can you hurt them, as in &quot;they&#39;ll get stuck<br/>
that way?&quot; Or can you do some other kind of damage by crossing them?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I crossed mine a lot when I was a kid. The consequence is I got better at<br/>
crossing them. Now I can even &quot;cross&quot; them independently so one moves in<br/>
while the other stares straight ahead.<br/>
<br/>
A skill that adults don&#39;t see much use in but impresses kids :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think so. Conor did some of that vision therapy stuff and that was <br/>
one of the exercises. I think it&#39;s supposed to strengthen the eye muscles <br/>
and help with tracking. FWIW<br/>

<br/>
If you cross your eyes a lot, it hurts at first and hurts less later, which I <br/>
suppose is the same deal with other muscles.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that is a traditional parental lie in the category of &quot;if you stick <br/>
your tongue out your face will feeze that way&quot; <br/>
and <br/>
&quot;If you play with yourself (advice to boys only) you&#39;ll grow hair on your <br/>
palms.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-978349824">Thank you folks for reassuring me! My son has been working on this skill<br/>
for a while, now has gotten so he can move them independently etc. I try<br/>
not to look at him too much when he says &quot;look at this, Mom,&quot; because it<br/>
creeps me out.<br/>
<br/>
But my mil was over yesterday  and he got a big reaction out of her. So<br/>
every time she looked at him, of course, his eyes were rolling all over the<br/>
place. He repeatedly got the &quot;they&#39;ll get stuck that way&quot; from her. Then my<br/>
husband chimes in by rolling his eyes up in his head so you can only see<br/>
the whites, his claim to fame.<br/>
<br/>
I thought of you all because of the reading in bed thing. The other thing<br/>
my mom always told me was that you would hurt your eyes by reading in the<br/>
dark (low light). I asked my eye doctor about that and he said no, that<br/>
will not damage your vision.<br/>
