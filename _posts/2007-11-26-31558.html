<div id="ygrps-yiv-114098375">I found this at Oxford English Dictionary site where they&#39;ve noted  <br/>
that &quot;set&quot; has been unseated from it&#39;s top position at least  <br/>
temporarily as they wend slowly through updating it. I&#39;m guessing  <br/>
just from the shortness of all the words that, except for the  <br/>
prefixes, that they&#39;re all Old English.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; set (the verb) no longer the longest entry in the OED<br/>
&gt; For many years the verb to set has been cited as the longest entry  <br/>
&gt; in the OED. But a recheck shows that it has at last been toppled  <br/>
&gt; from this position. The longest entry in the revised matter is  <br/>
&gt; represented by the verb to make (published in June 2000). However,  <br/>
&gt; it is quite possible that set will regain its long-held position at  <br/>
&gt; the top of the league of long words when it comes itself to be  <br/>
&gt; revised.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In ranking order, the longest entries currently in the online Third  <br/>
&gt; Edition of the OED are: make (verb - revised), set (verb), run  <br/>
&gt; (verb), take (verb), go (verb), pre- (revised), non- (revised),  <br/>
&gt; over- (revised), stand (verb), red, and then point (the noun -  <br/>
&gt; revised).<br/>
