<div id="ygrps-yiv-900696962">My daughter is 3.5 and she loves to dance.  Any time she hears music she&#39;ll start to move and dance around.  At the moment she&#39;s really into ballet.  She has talked about having ballet lessons one day, but right now I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s the best thing for her.<br/>
<br/>
This was all sparked by a DVD she owns, Barbie in The 12 Dancing Princesses.  We watch the movie often, and one of her favourite parts is the special features section.  It shows a bit about how the dance moves were choreographed, and shows the real dancer talking about her day and life as a dancer.<br/>
<br/>
My friend who is a dancer has been to our house a few times to do some ballet with Caitlyn, which she enjoyed immensely.  My friend also let Caitlyn try on her pointe shoes which was wonderful!<br/>
<br/>
We have some beautiful classical music CD&#39;s which she loves to dance to.<br/>
<br/>
My sister just gave her a pair of shoes that look a little like ballet slippers.  Caitlyn likes wearing them, but she wants a real pair of pointe shoes too!<br/>
<br/>
I was hoping someone else might have some ideas of how to continue to encourage this love of ballet (and all dancing), without having to jump straight into formal lessons.  Any other dancing movies we could watch?  I was thinking of getting Centre Stage for her, just for the dance scenes.  Any other ideas?<br/>
<br/>
I was also thinking of making her a tutu and buying a leotard or a swimming costume, to complete her outfit.  Maybe add some ribbon to her slippers so they are more like pointe shoes.<br/>
<br/>
I also thought I could get a couple of other little girls together in their dancing clothes, put on some music and just see what happens.  Not a class as such, just a way to get that class environment for her, without the structure that a formal class would impose.<br/>
<br/>
Wow, I had more ideas than I thought.  But I&#39;m sure there&#39;s still more I could do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-531272314">You might be surprised at how relaxed classes for kids that age run. Especially the summer ones. Our daughter doesn&#39;t like doing recitals and all that, so she takes summer classes only. They have fewer kids, more one-on-one and are more about exploring dance through play than making sure everything&#39;s done &quot;the correct way&quot;. It might be worth checking out. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1462241503">Is there a reason you&#39;re not sure the ballet class would be for her?<br/>
I ask because my almost 3 yr old can&#39;t wait until she can go &quot;do&quot; ballet!  My friend even suggested she make a bar for Nicki to hold on to while she does the positions.<br/>
She first learned about ballet also through tv and a show called Angelina Ballerina, a mouse who is a ballet student.<br/>
My daughter also enjoys her gymnastics class at a real gym.  I thought she wouldn&#39;t like the coach telling her what to do, but she really thrives on the guidance, support and structure the class gives her while she is learning the aspects of it.<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-28358397">At that age onward, my daughter has loved The Nutcracker.  We have multiple DVDs of different companies performing it.  Her favorite is George Balanchine&#39;s The Nutcracker because the leads are kids.  She picked out a nutcracker doll at Michael&#39;s this year and she and her brother have spent countless hours re-enacting scenes from the ballet and dancing along with the DVD.  We took her to the actual ballet last Christmas to see it in person and she was utterly mesmerized.<br/>
 <br/>
Also, the book Lili at Ballet by Rachel Isadora was a big hit with my daughter at age 3.5.  <br/>

&gt;    <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Those are great ideas. There is nothing like formal dance classes for 3 <br/>
year olds to potentially take all the joy out of dancing.  I&#39;m really <br/>
pleased to hear of a parent who doesn&#39;t instantly think, &quot;Oh, my young <br/>
child is loving to xyz so I should put her in xyz classes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the great ideas you gave, you could go to dance concerts. <br/>
Every community college around here has a big dance concert at the end <br/>
of each semester. These include all kinds of dance - jazz, tap, ballet, <br/>
hip-hop, latin, modern, etc. They are in full costume, etc. Usually they <br/>
are way too long for a 3 year old - but you could sit on an aisle and go <br/>
in and out - not sit for 3 hours (yes, that&#39;s how long they are, <br/>
sometimes).<br/>
<br/>
I really like your idea of giving her the costumes and props. You could <br/>
include tap shoes and a big piece of linoleum to tap dance on, too. <br/>
Payless Shoes has small child size ballet and tap shoes very inexpensive <br/>
- real ones. Dance stores are very expensive.<br/>
<br/>
Some kids like a little &quot;stage&quot; to perform on --- we had one in our back <br/>
yard for a long time. It was a large piece of plywood set up on bricks - <br/>
only one-brick high - but enough to feel like it was special to be <br/>
dancing or acting up on it.<br/>
<br/>
Where I live, we have dance and musical theater performances that are <br/>
aimed at children. You could look around for those - look at the <br/>
websites of any venues you have nearby. Again, don&#39;t forget colleges - <br/>
they often have a series of performances for children on Saturday <br/>
afternoons. And, look at big impressive venues - we&#39;ve gone to the <br/>
Hollywood Bowl for children&#39;s performances that were free, even.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t look for instructional dance videos, by the way, but I&#39;d look <br/>
for really fun musical theater that has great dancing in it. Also, look <br/>
for episodes of Sesame Street with tap dancer Savion Glover. There is a <br/>
Sesame Street DVD called &quot;Get Up and Dance&quot; which is wonderful!<br/>
<br/>
Ah - and get the video of CATS, the Musical. My dancing kids wore out <br/>
our vhs tape of CATS (pre-DVD&#39;s) and we went and saw it live about 12 <br/>
times, too. Each cat is a personality and they do all different kinds of <br/>
dance, including ballet. Be ready to help make Cats costumes and do cats <br/>
make-up and get the cd, too, so she can dance to that music.<br/>

======<br/>
<br/>
My daughter just completed her first year of dance.  She was 3.5 years last fall when the year started.  She took a tap/ballet combo class that included a bit of tumbling.  That is the standard class for her age group at her school.  The children can&#39;t pick a specific dance style until they are six, and even then, pointe is not an option.  <br/>
<br/>
Abby&#39;s class mostly consisted of creative movement and play.  There was a lot of &quot;let&#39;s pretend to be...&quot; and my daughter&#39;s personal favorite, The Hokey Pokey.  Those types of activities could easily be done at home.  There are books available on creative movement that would have many ideas for you.  Unfortunatly, I can&#39;t think of the names of any right now.<br/>
<br/>
I used a lot of Frank Leto and John English CDs when I taught preschool, and I still use them at home with my three kids (4, 8, 11).  The are both great artists that are awesome for creative movement.  Frank Leto&#39;s music is all original, and includes a lot of follow the leader type stuff where he says or does something that you repeat.  John English is more traditional kids music like &quot;Sally the Camel&quot; and &quot;The Hokey Pokey&quot; but sung in a way that doesn&#39;t great on my nerves (Just his soothing voice and his acoustic guitar).<br/>
<br/>
Target and WalMart both sell Danskin dance attire.  Real leather ballet shoes for little girls are avialable at your local dance supply store for about $10-$15.  Tap shoes tend to be a bit more expensive in the $30-$40 range, but they are a lot of fun.<br/>
<br/>
Happy dancing,<br/>

Ive bought many a leotard and dance costume at the thrift store for a  <br/>
dollar. Ive gotten very inexpensive tap shoes on ebay as well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1770343305">We had lots of wonderful hours playing &quot;ballet&quot; when my youngest was  <br/>
3.  She had many beautiful dresses and costumes that we&#39;d picked up at  <br/>
thrift stores.  we&#39;d put various classical music (and some jazz) on  <br/>
the stereo and just dance.  We also had pretend tickets and programs  <br/>
that were part of a little book set.  There was an announcer on the  <br/>
audio that introduced the dancers.  There was lots of joy in it.<br/>

The idea which came to my mind was to have music on and move and dance <br/>
to it much as she wants, both of you dancing together and her dancing <br/>
with you as audience. Play at moving and dancing and at being dancers.<br/>
Think of all movement as dance and all sound as music. Suddenly, your <br/>
whole life is dancing and moving and music!<br/>

Have fun,<br/>

<br/>
My personal favorite is Creative Dance for All Ages by Ann Green<br/>
Gilbert.  I&#39;ve used that for inspiration for many a dance class.  It&#39;s<br/>
more for dance teachers, and I&#39;ve gotten a lot of use from it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

The are both great artists that are awesome for creative movement.<br/>
<br/>
Hap Palmer is VERY movement oriented with his music.  I&#39;ve used his<br/>
stuff loads.  I&#39;ve also used Sesame Street stuff, Jim Gill, Greg and<br/>
Steve, Chopin, and one of my personal favorites for dance classes;<br/>
Tempo, Level, Energy, and Shapes: Music and Movement Concepts for Young<br/>
Dancers.  I&#39;ve also used various celtic music, stuff like Enya, music<br/>
from actual ballets and dance pieces, and contemporary stuff.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
A lot of people don&#39;t know this, but ballet shoes are supposed to fit<br/>
snug.  When Chamille was little and wanted tappy shoes, that&#39;s what she<br/>
called them, and we were always very broke, we put tacks on her heels<br/>
and that worked great!<br/>
<br/>
Also, for props and such, kids love scarves and ribbons.  I also used to<br/>
use masking tape to make obstacle courses for jumping and leaping.  It<br/>
sticks to any surface and comes off easily!</div>

 </span></blockquote>I wonder if your local recreation district offers any summer classes?  Sometimes rec districts will offer very casual summer classes (our local dance studio does this as well) which are shorter in duration and very low key.  <br/>
<br/>
Although I am suggesting it I must explain; I put my dd in one of those classes when she was about 3 (she wanted to to ballet classes)and she didn&#39;t like it at all -- she said she &quot;felt squished.&quot;  She wanted to be able to dance her own way and not follow directions, doing only certain moves.  So she has spent the last 3.5 years having a great time just dancing and choreographing routines at home and with her friends.  <br/>
<br/>
Only this last fall did she decide that she wanted to try a ballet/jazz class again, and this time she loved it.  Now she is doing a hiphop class and has requested private lessons with the instructor.  Finding a less formal way for your dd to try ballet classes might allow her to see what it is really about.  Maybe there are a some dance studios in your area that will allow you to try a couple of classes for free.  That would satisfy your dd&#39;s curiosity and keep you from putting a lot of money into classes.<br/>
<br/>
As far as movie suggestions, my DD always loves the Angelina Ballerina dvds.  They have a little bit with real girls dancing in between the stories.  There are lots of Barbie movies and all have dancing and my daughter still loves these, some based on actual ballets (Nutcracker, Swan Lake).  And then there are Cirque du Soleil dvds, not all dance, but include some amazing movement to music which have inspired weeks worth of play at our house.  And how about finding some of the truly amazing dance videos on youtube and watching those?  <br/>
<br/>
There are loads of great children&#39;s books about dancing and ballerinas, check your local library for both dvds and books.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh, and we have the Angelina Ballerina board game ... as you play the game you have to do ballet moves.  I wonder if there are any other dancing games out there?  I know there are kids&#39; yoga games, so I would think there could be more dancing games as well.  She is too young for Dance Dance Revolution just yet, but we have both the Wii and GC versions and they are a blast, great for playing and dancing with your child. <br/>
<br/>
I am going to mostly just agree with Tom and everyone else who suggested putting on music and costumes and dancing with your daughter.  I dance all the time with my kids, we move the furniture to clear a space and just move ... not so much ballet anymore, hiphop is more the style of late (Planet B-Boy documentary and Step Up 2 The Streets being the main sources of inspiration).  In fact, dancing with my children inspired me to revisit my love of modern dance and enroll in classes for myself.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun dancing!  <br/>
Cathy<br/>
<br/>
PS I don&#39;t know if they do community dances anywhere near you, like beginning square dances or contra dances, but my kids have always loved going to those.  If it is a dance that is for beginners, they are often very accomodating to very young dancers.  My dd has been dancing at these since she was 3 or 4 (and I danced with my youngest in a sling until he was 3).</div>

can find a big mirror for a room in your house, or maybe if you have a  <br/>
