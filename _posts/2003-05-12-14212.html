<div id="ygrps-yiv-341799604">AHhh!  I&#39;ve always LOVED that song!  (and other Sondheim things as well, and <br/>
Mandy Patinkin in general)  I hadn&#39;t really thought of it since I&#39;ve come <br/>
across unschooling but it fits SO WELL!!!  Now I&#39;ve got to go track down <br/>
those songs online and listen to them again!! Thanks!  :)<br/>
