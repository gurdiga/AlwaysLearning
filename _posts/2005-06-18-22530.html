For  awhile now, I have been avoiding mentioning subjects and it has been  so<br/>
freeing.  The myriad of things my children explore is nothing less  than a<br/>
delight to witness.  It&#39;s doubly delightful not having that  nagging<br/>
&quot;schooly&quot; voice in my head going, &quot;Well, that there was  math.&quot;  Or, &quot;This<br/>
here is history.&quot;  Occasionally, it comes to  haunt me.  The days I just<br/>
forget altogether about school or subjects  of any sort are the ones I really<br/>
savor.<br/>

I&#39;m aware that part of what makes our unschooling solid is that our state  <br/>
doesn&#39;t require reporting.  If I had to break it all out and name it (even  just <br/>
in secret on paper) it would burst some of our big bubble!<br/>
