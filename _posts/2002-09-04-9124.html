Would you like me to send you the information on the origins of the pledge so <br/>
you have that for family? I wouldn&#39;t give it to them unless it came up again, <br/>
but I might inform my kids....it&#39;s very interesting and well worth knowing in <br/>
my opinion.<br/>
Why don&#39;t we memorize something useful? I think it&#39;s just another form of <br/>
brainwashing people.<br/>

Yep, that&#39;s how I found it too Nancy!!  Sent it to several people, probably <br/>
pissed some off.  I felt very enlightened after reading that. Glad you found <br/>
it, I was going to google it again to post it here.<br/>

I didn&#39;t know that.  It would be cheaper for them to just fine you like they <br/>
do the rest of us!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if they stop you and you spout off at the cop in that incomprehensible <br/>
Monty-Python accent, well YEAH!  They&#39;ll send you back to your socialist <br/>
motherland.  <br/>
<br/>
But the first time I was visiting England BBC as showing re-runs of old Dukes <br/>
of Hazard shows, and this last time they were watching Little House on the <br/>
Prairie.  So you&#39;ve got a good-old-boy American accent to use in case you <br/>
speed, get stopped, and still want to stay here with the rest of us speeding <br/>
hicks.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m aquanted with Europeans with international<br/>
licenses who never pay their fines or respond to<br/>
tickets.  They also do not pay attention to speed<br/>
limits. They DO stop when the siren and lights go on.<br/>
Then proceed on their way.  I do not recommend this<br/>
practice....but these volk declare that they do do<br/>
this. Perhaps they don&#39;t really, and were only showing<br/>
off to each other........<br/>

have an accent. You lot do :-)<br/>

<br/>
The kind brits can understand and Americans can&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I saw an English movie that was subtitled, and GOOD THING, because I would <br/>
have understood maybe 1/4 of it.  Riff Raff, with Robert Carlyle.  I don&#39;t <br/>
know if the video was subtitled even in England.  I guess I doubt it.  But <br/>
for some reason they rent it across the vacant street from my house.   There <br/>
are lots of different accents and a ton of slang.<br/>
