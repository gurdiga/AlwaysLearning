<div id="ygrps-yiv-200318542">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to try to get this out quickly so that one hundred other<br/>
emails don&#39;t get here first with the same thing. (this is why I am an<br/>
interminable lurker - I&#39;m almost never actually caught up and by the<br/>
time I would get around to writing a reply, lots of others have beat me<br/>
to it) (an intro is coming up, honest)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what we&#39;ve done to grow crystals. We haven&#39;t used one of those<br/>
kits, so haven&#39;t got any advice about those. They look pretty neat. What<br/>
a bummer that they didn&#39;t work for you.<br/>
<br/>
Get some borax, colored pipe cleaners, a pencil, ribbon and a glass jar<br/>
or can. (make sure the glass jar has a mouth that is big enough, though,<br/>
or you might have to break the jar to get the crystal out.  :-o )<br/>
<br/>
Get the pipe cleaner ready by shaping it - spirals, hearts, stars,<br/>
whatever -  then using the ribbon (or whatever else might look nice to<br/>
hang it from), tie it to the pencil so it will hang down into the jar or<br/>
can. (but don&#39;t put it in the jar yet) Put some boiling water into the<br/>
jar and mix in borax a bit at a time, constantly stirring until it stops<br/>
dissolving. It took quite a bit in a peanut butter jar though. (The<br/>
amount of borax reaches some kind of limit in the solution - what&#39;s that<br/>
called -  saturation?) Then hang the pipe cleaner from the pencil across<br/>
the top of the jar. Make sure there is enough room around the pipe<br/>
cleaner in all directions (and that it&#39;s deep enough) for the crystals<br/>
to grow. I don&#39;t remember exactly how long it takes, but let it sit and<br/>
in a couple/few days you&#39;ll have crystals growing on the pipe cleaner.<br/>
It makes a very nice (but very heavy) christmas ornament and looks nice<br/>
hanging in a window too.<br/>
<br/>
Uh-oh, this took too long, the intro will have to wait... :-)<br/>
