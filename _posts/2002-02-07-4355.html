<div id="ygrps-yiv-1386235737"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;:) That is a chemistry question!! Science in<br/>
&gt;life...WHY? The portions were too small is a<br/>
&gt;hypothesis. So try bigger portions. WHY does this work<br/>
&gt;better? or does it? What happens if you substitute<br/>
&gt;something for something else? WHY?&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I just remembered a fun thing we did. You take a basic muffin recipe and <br/>
play around with it. You make lots of different versions of the batter. Each <br/>
time, you leave out a different ingredient and see what happens when you <br/>
bake them. It becomes very obvious what sugar, eggs, flour or baking soda do <br/>
for a recipe.<br/>
