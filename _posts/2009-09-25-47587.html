<div id="ygrps-yiv-81665783">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I am on a low budget as a single parent, and would love some suggestions as to how to make some games. Eli is 4 and just starting to really enjoy them (usually with a little assistance, games like Guess Who Jr, Monopoly Jr) and as I can&#39;t afford to buy more games right now I thought it might be fun to make our own.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking Snakes and Ladders would be pretty easy, and we could make some Snap cards etc using some magazine pictures and cardboard (if Eli is interested, otherwise I&#39;m keen to go for it on my own). Does anyone know of some good websites with games ideas? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>
Kerrie in Australia.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-232522137">Maybe ask on Freecycle, or go to a thrift store and buy some playing  <br/>
cards and a book of card games.<br/>
<br/>
But there are game directions and games themselves on the internet.   <br/>
There are games to print out and color, and games to play right  <br/>
there.  There are traditional games and games with easily found  <br/>
gameboards (garage sales, fleamarkets)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks Alex, I LOVE going to garage sales. But I don&#39;t actually have my drivers license yet, which makes getting around to sales a bit hard. I am assuming thrift stores is the American term for opshops/second hand stores? I have thought about buying games there but assumed some pieces are missing (they tape the boxes up over here.) But 1( I guess I shouldn&#39;t assume and 2) I didn&#39;t think before, I can definately substitute missing pieces anyway! <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks Rue, I will have to google Mancala as I haven&#39;t heard of that one. Memory is a good one! A few weeks ago I got hold of some empty film canisters and we made some shakers to match up which was fun. Eg in one pair, we put rice, in another, sand, then bird seed, then wooden beads. They now double as maraccas when I put the Buena Vista Social Club cd on :o)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1291183559">We make up our own board games. We have one that Jayn has created making a <br/>
big grid like Tic-tac-toe. You take turns putting X or O and make 4 or 5 in <br/>
a row - fluid rules. The grid is drawn on cardboard, and we use pencil to <br/>
mark it.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn has also devised board games, just by drawing a curvy path and dividing <br/>
it into steps, and using any dice and any little figures.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn also has an RPG that she has made up using assorted small figures and <br/>
an ordinary pair of dice, as against the fancy probability dice of D&D. <br/>
Inspired by the characters she created a storyline and goals to do with <br/>
rescuing the kidnapped king from the sun demons, and we gave each character <br/>
an attribute sheet. The good guys are on a quest and have specific magical <br/>
abilities. They periodically meet up with bad guys and fight - using the <br/>
dice to determine the outcomes. After each battle their attributes are <br/>
improved again by rolling the dice and adding numbers. It&#39;s also very fluid.<br/>
<br/>
For years Jayn has been playing a big battlefield game with her dad. They <br/>
have a large piece of foam core and they set out their two armies of <br/>
assorted small plastic characters and then do something with them to which I <br/>
am not privvy. They work out the formal rules between them. It seems to have <br/>
no end.<br/>
<br/>
The point of the games are to spend time together laughing.<br/>

What about DVDs with a Spanish soundtrack option?  DVDs he already  <br/>
knows really well?  Not to study or try to parse out, but just to hear  <br/>
as background while he&#39;s playing lego or drawing or something.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe Spanish songs for kids, with words under?  There might be  <br/>
something on the internet.<br/>
<br/>
Spanish-language Sesame Street might be online somewhere.  I&#39;m not  <br/>

European Spanish accent, more.<br/>

I would look for things little kids in a Spanish-speaking place would  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>One game that would be easy to make would be Pente<br/>
<br/>
Simply get a big piece of graph paper (or make one) and get some colored beads.<br/>
<br/>
As your child gets older, you might want to expose him to role-playing games. Many can be downloaded for free in PDF form. Here is an example:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.swordsandwizardry.com/?page_id=4">http://www.swordsandwizardry.com/?page_id=4</a><br/>
<br/>
or<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.goblinoidgames.com/labyrinthlord.html">http://www.goblinoidgames.com/labyrinthlord.html</a><br/>
<br/>
These will give you countless hours of gaming, and help your child build his vocabulary, story-telling ability, math skills, etc. The games I have listed are easy to learn.</div>

<br/>
It wasn&#39;t a recommendation.  I was trying to suggest that hiring a housekeeper that speaks Spanish, so your kids could learn Spanish wasn&#39;t really the best of ideas.  Housekeepers are supposed to clean house, they aren&#39;t paid to help someone&#39;s child learn Spanish.  If you happen to have someone that comes into your house that speaks Spanish and does work for you and they are chatty and friendly with your kids, then great.<br/>
<br/>
Hiring a tutor to teach your child Spanish isn&#39;t exactly unschooling.  True too.  When Margaux was about 5 or 6, she wanted to learn French.  It was short lived.  She is still interested in other languages, she would do amazing in a bilingual home, but that&#39;s not what she has!  She played lots of Madeline games and I told her a lot of words that I know in French, and we always read the French labels on things like shampoo and I translate it for her.  One of the little neighbor boy speaks Spanish and Margaux copies the mother&#39;s inflections very well and pronounces the little boy&#39;s name the same way his mother does.  She&#39;s very proud to know how to say the word &quot;candy&quot; in Spanish. (she learned that from hitting a pinata at their house)<br/>
<br/>
When Chamille was 6, we were actively involved with a private rec center where they had Spanish classes.  She took some and loved it a lot.  She doesn&#39;t remember much from those classes, but she was the one who wanted to take them, largely because she liked the woman who was teaching them.  She mostly took gymnastics classes during the times that I was teaching dance classes.  The Spanish classes took place in my dance room, so I wasn&#39;t ever teaching during that class and often joined in with her.  They played lots of games, it was fun.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1140900021">-=-I do have one question. If a child wanted to learn a particular  <br/>
subject, knitting for example, would it be against unschooling  <br/>
principles to take lessons?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re asking for a rule rather than a principle. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Neither all nor nothing can be &quot;the right answer,&quot; but at each  <br/>
decision-making juncture is &quot;what are the options?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes a person needs just one lesson to understand how the  <br/>
instrument/equipment/directions work, and then they can zoom off on  <br/>
their own.  I was that way myself with calligraphy, recorder and  <br/>
guitar.  I had messed with all of them, but when I went to get  <br/>
lessons, what I needed was how far to dip the pen in the ink, and what  <br/>
angles to hold it, because there&#39;s an angle to the paper, and the the  <br/>
angle of the wide nib in relation to the writer&#39;s hand.  I didn&#39;t  <br/>
understand those from written directions (if they were there; they  <br/>
weren&#39;t, exactly, I discovered later).<br/>
<br/>
The first recorder lesson I got showed me how different the  <br/>
&quot;embouchure&quot; (how to hold one&#39;s mouth inside, and on the mouthpiece)  <br/>
was from other wind instruments.  Very light and soft.  And I needed  <br/>
to see how to hold the instrument when most holes were open.  How&#39;s  <br/>
the recorder not to just fall on the floor?<br/>
<br/>
With guitar, I expected to take lots of lessons, but one lesson with  <br/>
how to read chord charts and how to fingerpick sent me on an excited  <br/>
look through all the music and folksong books I already had with  <br/>
guitar chords *right there* though I&#39;d never thought of what all those  <br/>
superscript D G and A things were about.<br/>
<br/>
With knitting, it might need some explanations and good, modern  <br/>
supplies and samples of what happens if needles or yarn aren&#39;t the  <br/>
recommended size.  I have a baby hat that fits me, that a friend  <br/>
made.   She explained why, and I still wear the hat that was supposed  <br/>
to have fit Kirby.  (It would fit him now, actually; maybe I should  <br/>
send her another thank-you-note.  &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Is knitting something you the parent might want to learn too?  Maybe  <br/>
you could both go to a class and then help each other later.<br/>
<br/>
If she does start to knit, maybe keep an eye out for interesting  <br/>
articles or pieces or blog posts or patterns.  Even if it&#39;s way beyond  <br/>
her ability to do, she might like to know the range of what&#39;s  <br/>
possible, and how far back people knitted, what knitting&#39;s relatives  <br/>
are, or she might not care.  It could connect to lots of things.<br/>
<br/>
If the parents&#39; first thought is &quot;lessons&quot; and they expect to simply  <br/>
pay another person to insure that their children will learn all of a  <br/>
thing, then the parents are probably not far enough into becoming  <br/>
unschoolers yet, and could use some more time finding connections and  <br/>
natural learning.<br/>

<br/>
I didn&#39;t see this from the OP, so I&#39;m responding to the secondary post. I learned to knit from books that I checked out at the library. My mom showed me how when I was a kid and I can remember sitting outside on a lawn chair trying to purl or knit and failing and getting distracted and it came to naught. Years later, pregnant with my second child, getting ready to go to spend Christmas with my grandparents and my mom and step-dad I got some books from the library and figured out how to knit. Linnaea&#39;s first passport photo has her in the first sweater I ever knitted. After years of not quite getting it right I spent some time in the past year watching videos on-line and asking people who love to knit about what I was doing wrong and I&#39;ve now made 2 pairs of socks. One pair from the top down one from the bottom up. For me the learning happened because I wanted the skill. If your child wants to learn to make something particular, go to youtube and see what<br/>
 you can find on knitting that thing. If you know someone who knits, or you join up with a group of people where there is also knitting going on talk to the knitting folks and they&#39;ll give pointers. Basic knitting is fairly easy. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1884785108">Sometimes it&#39;s resources that determine lessons for us - as Sandra said &quot;what are the options?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
For example we do not live where we can have a horse, nor can we afford to stable one, so we take lessons.  I had a horse as a child but there are so many things that I never learned from just riding on my own - bareback and a bridle only. We started the riding lessons a couple of years ago - I decided I was going to take lessons and Zac (age 15) wanted to too.  Ed (hubby) took for a year with us.<br/>
<br/>
Zac just started Japanese sword fighting lessons 2 weeks ago.  His choice totally - he requested it after we attended the local Japan Festival.  It might last another week or it might last several years.  It is a pay by the month deal with no lengthy contracts like some martial arts places.  He could have probably found stuff on-line to watch to help him acquire these skills but he wanted to be more precise in his skill, therefore he wants to take lessons from a master.  The Japan Festival came about because I hear about things to do and mention them to Zac to see if he is interested.  Knowing how is he all about anything Japanese I saw this festival and showed him the web site and asked if he wanted to go.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
With carving he went through a 2 year stage where he carved constantly,  Mostly replica weapons and mostly replica swords of various types.  I offered to help find a master carver for him to work with (there are guilds locally and several offered to let him join) and he said no he was not interested in that.  We basically had the resources though, a good knife and a grinder.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s taken lessons of various types over the years, some he&#39;s stuck with for several years and some only a few lessons.  For instance he took a volleyball class - said the constant drill, drill, drill  took all the fun out of playing - he just wanted to play casually so he quit.  He played basketball for one season and really enjoyed the casual, divide everyone up and let&#39;s play, way of doing it.  Fencing he took for a year then ceased.   HapKiDo he did for 4 or more years. etc.<br/>
<br/>
So it does all depend on our options.<br/>

&gt; principles to take lessons?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My first thought was Oh no!! The unschooling police!  :)<br/>
<br/>
My dd11 wanted to knit about a year ago.  She specifically asked to go to the local shop (A Knot of Yarn, that sadly closed down not too long ago) to find out if someone could show her.  We went together, she walked in, and asked questions.  I didn&#39;t need to say anything.  The owner was wonderful.  My dd decided to sign up for a group class.  She spent her time with adults, knitting, talking, and having a great time.  And then she didn&#39;t want to go anymore.  We had paid a fee for the instruction but she was done.  I didn&#39;t make her complete the time paid just because we spent the money.  So no, I don&#39;t think there is anything wrong with &quot;lessons&quot; (though I&#39;m not sure that word is always applicable) if the child wants to do it and is never forced to continue for arbitrary reasons.  In our case, we didn&#39;t know anyone personally who could knit, but we had driven by that shop lots of times.  It was the first place dd thought about.  In fact, I wonder if she wanted to learn because we drove past it so much.  :)<br/>
<br/>
She is taking music lessons now, playing 2 instruments and loves every moment of it.  She is also in a beginning orchestra.  She is really good and her instructor thinks she has a natural talent.  However, my dd11 knows she can quit or make changes.  This is about her, not about me making something for her.<br/>

that the parent has that label in mind and finds people willing to consider <br/>
themselves competence models.<br/>
<br/>
With something like knitting, I would imagine that would be easy, since <br/>
there are a lot of knitters out there, including many unschoolers. Plus <br/>
there are a lot of free and easy to access resources such as videos on You <br/>
Tube, that will leave the onus on the learner.<br/>
<br/>
The great thing about competence models is that they only have to be <br/>
slightly more accomplished to be helpful. Or they can be absolutely experts. <br/>
And any age at all.<br/>
<br/>
[I&#39;m going to fail to cite my source here (Holt?) - because I&#39;m a bit <br/>
pressed for time. But I&#39;ll make a note to self to look for it later. ]<br/>
<br/>
There is some research that shows that children learn many things best from <br/>
competence models that are only a bit older and more competent than <br/>
themselves.<br/>

The 2nd half is filled with games you can make at home. They range from card games, to snakes & ladders, to quartette, trap the king, and onward. I enjoy most of the games, and my kids (4, 6, and 8) have all enjoyed them as well. <br/>

I&#39;m not sure the book is available in every library, but I&#39;m sure you could get it on inter-library loan. <br/>

&gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am on a low budget as a single parent, and would love some suggestions as to how to make some games. Eli is 4 and just starting to really enjoy them (usually with a little assistance, games like Guess Who Jr, Monopoly Jr) and as I can&#39;t afford to buy more games right now I thought it might be fun to make our own.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was thinking Snakes and Ladders would be pretty easy, and we could make some Snap cards etc using some magazine pictures and cardboard (if Eli is interested, otherwise I&#39;m keen to go for it on my own). Does anyone know of some good websites with games ideas? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance,<br/>
