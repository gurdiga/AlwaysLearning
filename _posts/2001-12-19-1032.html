LOL, Karen, I was going to post that one.  Hey, want a Coke?  Yeah, sure.<br/>
Alright. What kind?<br/>
<br/>
Is that just a Texas thing or a southwest thing?<br/>

<br/>
My refined, sophisticated friend from Long Island was here, along with <br/>
my down-home sophisticated friend from Alabama.  I had a cooler full of <br/>
iced-down cokes out in the garage and I went out to get one.  Down-home <br/>
friend got a one, too, and we both plopped down in the den while refined <br/>
friend asked if she could have one.  Sure, I said, and I popped up and <br/>
got her a can of Diet Coke.<br/>
<br/>
I will never forget watching refined, sophisticated friend pace back and <br/>
forth across my den while she decided what to actually *do* with the can <br/>
in her hand, nor will I forget that puzzled look on her face! <br/>
 Remembering my manners, I asked if she wanted a glass with ice, and she <br/>
said, in her refined, sophisticated New York way, &quot;No, I would just like <br/>
to know how to open it!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Forget pop, soda or coke.  There are vast cultural divides that we can <br/>
only stumble upon by accident!<br/>
