<br/>
-=-May I suggest Marshall Rosenberg&#39;s book Non-Violent Communication.  <br/>
Not sure if anyone has heard of  it...wonderful ideas on communicating  <br/>
with our loved ones! -=-<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to send her a link to a recent discussion on this topic, but  <br/>
I didn&#39;t find it.  Was it somewhere besides here?  (If there&#39;s a pre- <br/>
saved discussion on non-violent communication that would be good to  <br/>
link here.  Sorry I didn&#39;t find it.  I&#39;m hoping someone here can.)<br/>

updated search they want groups to migrate to, or something.<br/>
<br/>
I found many posts on the subject in my own folder, but when I  <br/>
searched the exact subject lines, any of the posters in the  <br/>
discussions, or dates, nothing came up at all. Weird.<br/>
