<div id="ygrps-yiv-409548379">Infinite possibilities: you could move to another house, you could <br/>
have your husband work elsewhere, you could remodel the space to have <br/>
a mini-kitchen or refrigerator more convient, you could have an <br/>
elevator installed. Yes, you might need to choose to go back to work <br/>
or might choose not to use all your retirement money, etc. But we <br/>
always have choices.<br/>
<br/>
*********************************************************************************************************************************<br/>
That&#39;s funny.  I really do agree with you.  I believe in liberty for all and I do make an extended effort to live that way.<br/>
