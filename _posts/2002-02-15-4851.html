(she is just starting to read and usually doesn&#39;t know the words<br/>
she is copying,,,but enjoys copying them anyway) She LOVES<br/>
writing and would rather use the book as a guide to the correct <br/>
spelling of words instead of asking me how to spell things for <br/>
her all the time. <br/>
