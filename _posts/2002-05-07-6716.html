<div id="ygrps-yiv-697218839">I&#39;ve been wondering what makes someone unschool, or even, just <br/>
homeschool.  It is this huge investment of self.  <br/>
<br/>
Okay.  I watched Frontier House a week ago, I guess.  For those of <br/>
you who didn&#39;t see it one family who was voluntarily hauled off into <br/>
the wilderness were relatively divorced from each other.  That is <br/>
they spent very little time together.  By the end of their <br/>
experience on &quot;the frontier&quot;, terminal though it was, they had grown <br/>
much closer and spoke of enjoying each other quite a bit. When they <br/>
got back to their real lives they abandoned much of what they had <br/>
experienced on &quot;the frontier&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
See, I had expected that when you discovered the joys of spending <br/>
time with each other it would be obvious that anything else was a <br/>
less than experience.  But by three months post frontiering they <br/>
were doing very little to embrace each other.  <br/>
<br/>
So, what brought you to the decision that not only being with your <br/>
children was more valuable than the potential cash and status you <br/>
could earn in the workplace (even recognizing that when two parents <br/>
are working outside of the home one income is almost entirely eaten <br/>
up by the expenses that are incurred by working outside of the home, <br/>
but that these children aer people who are able to voice their own <br/>
opinions, recognize their own needs, and choose their own paths?  <br/>
Why is it that this choice is not the obvious choice?  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if I can answer these questions.  So, maybe it is <br/>
absurd to ask others before I really explore my own choices.<br/>

Sometimes I wonder if this isn&#39;t a &quot;chicken or the egg&quot; kind of thing.  I<br/>
knew from the moment I held Lanora that nothing would matter more to me<br/>
than her well being.  Unschooling was a natural outcome of loving and<br/>
valuing my kids.  I don&#39;t think that unless one has this base already<br/>
that unschooling would be acceptable.<br/>

I tend to think that there is something fundamental about people that<br/>
makes them able to see how amazing and valuable their children are.  It<br/>
makes no sense to me that someone can see their jobs, financial status<br/>
and/or &quot;stuff&quot; as more interesting than their own children.  It&#39;s a state<br/>
of mind that I can&#39;t begin to understand, that leads me to believe that<br/>
it&#39;s a difference that goes right to the core of a person.<br/>
<br/>
I also believe that a LOT of people have children because it&#39;s one of<br/>
those things you do to prove you are normal.  You get married, have a<br/>
baby and buy a house, thus we have all manner of surrogate parent<br/>
institutions.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I guess it is hard for me to imagine that other people don&#39;t value <br/>
and love their children, too.  There seems to be a trade-off between <br/>
children and self that goes on in people and for many self wins.  <br/>
Not that I think unschooling isn&#39;t good for me, too.  But, people <br/>
seem to be spending huge amounts of time away from their children by <br/>
choice.  There are lots of people for whom their distance from their <br/>
children is not so voluntary, I recognize that.  <br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid our neighborhood was filled with children. They <br/>
were around because their mothers didn&#39;t work outside the home, so <br/>
they weren&#39;t in daycare after school and over the summer.  Why are <br/>
so many mothers working 15 years later?  <br/>

occasionally envy moments of solitude, but the resultant loss is far <br/>
too great to ever let go of being at home with my kids.  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are a lot of people now who aren&#39;t having children, the <br/>
pressure to prove normalcy must be on the decline.  And among my <br/>
friends who work with their children in school and daycare for far <br/>
more hours than they are home are some of the most maternalesque <br/>
women I have met.  There seems to be a desperate need to work.  <br/>
<br/>
I wonder if it is that I am so very lucky to not be married to <br/>
someone who uses their income against me.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-831067354"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Why is it that this choice is not the obvious choice?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe because it&#39;s not always recognized as a choice people have. You have <br/>
kids, you send &#39;em to school. That&#39;s the way it was done for (to) you, so <br/>
that&#39;s the way you&#39;ll do it with your own kids.<br/>
<br/>
I knew from the moment I got pregnant with Conor that I&#39;d never put him in <br/>
daycare. I broke lots of currently accepted parenting techniques to be with <br/>
him and fully attend to his needs. And yet, I still sent him to school for a <br/>
few years. I just never realized there was a different way. Duh!<br/>
<br/>
Someone has to set a different example, open a few doors in people&#39;s minds <br/>
to let the cobwebs air out. Maybe that&#39;s where *we* fit in. ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1601221735">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Years ago, as a friend of a friend&#39;s husband was complaining to her about her <br/>
&quot;unusual&quot; choices for their family (homeschooling, family bed, etc), she <br/>
replied - &quot;Don&#39;t you think I&#39;d rather be like everybody else, don&#39;t you think <br/>
that would be easier for me too??? But I just can&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Who knows why we take this path?  My former husband (military) used to ask me <br/>
why we couldn&#39;t be a &quot;normal&quot; family.  I told him to define normal!  <br/>
Basically he supported my unusual choices, but I think he occassionally got <br/>
tired of be so &quot;special&quot; surrounded by much more traditional families.  I <br/>
surrounded my self with LLL people and un/homeschoolers.  He used to tell me <br/>
I didn&#39;t live in the real world, I told him it was certainly my &quot;real&quot; world <br/>
- designed by choice.<br/>
<br/>
And, I think once we commit to this life style for whatever reason, we can <br/>
certainly see so many advantages.  Now, after over 20 years, when my oldest <br/>
son has married a woman who simply doesn&#39;t tolerate his family, therefore he <br/>
has cut us all out of his life (long painful story), I feel so blessed that I <br/>
had all that time with him thro his growing up years.  When my daughter <br/>
decided to continue to live with her father after our marriage ended, I once <br/>
again feel happy that I had so much time with her for the first 13 years.<br/>
<br/>
How far would you go?  I went as far as working at the local casino (on the <br/>
weekends) for a stint to keep things going and to maintain our <br/>
un&#39;/homeschooling situation.  After the court dismissed my teaching of the <br/>
children at home as not counting at all - so I ended up paying child support <br/>
(strange but true!), I wrote and told them I would do whatever it took to <br/>
keep that part of my children&#39;s lives the same (learning at home).  Actually <br/>
the casino was as extreme as it got.<br/>
<br/>
I believe the &quot;why&quot; is simply one more of life&#39;s great mysteries!! And a <br/>
wonderful one that it is!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1803707972">I&#39;m going to play devil&#39;s advocate here for a minute. (Deep breath.)<br/>
<br/>
How does unschooling differ from good parenting? Sandra&#39;s account of the<br/>
multiple wrecks (be careful out there, by the way!), while pointing out the<br/>
serendipitous learning that can occur anywhere, does not strike me as<br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot; as much as it does just being a good parent. Maybe I define<br/>
&quot;good parenting&quot; differently than others. But even when my kids were in<br/>
school way back, I still did the things I do now; I just had less time to do<br/>
them in. Having them home gives me more time to show them things, have fun<br/>
together, experience things. How do I explain that to someone who&#39;s asking<br/>
about unschooling? When I try, I end up sounding defensive (to my ears,<br/>
anyway.) How do you explain unschooling without justifying it?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s quite possible I should stop trying to explain it (I just about have)<br/>
or just choose my audiences more carefully.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also possible that unschooling IS good parenting, and education is what<br/>
has separated us from that fact. Wow. I may need to think on that awhile!<br/>

If Holly needed to be in school Tuesday morning, having her outside at 11:30 <br/>
at night (the whole deal lasted an hour, and started just after 10:30) would <br/>
be considered BAD parenting--she would be up past her bedtime, not &quot;preparing <br/>
for school&quot; by getting enough sleep.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;How do you explain unschooling without justifying it?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When people who aren&#39;t doing it try to explain it, it seems they usually get <br/>
it wrong.<br/>
I think those who are living this way, who explain it to others, come across <br/>
as justifying because they are being asked to do so!  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Those are my parents you are talking about.  I believe<br/>
that my brother and I were status children, trophies<br/>
if you will.  My parents were never very interested in<br/>
spending time with us, in what our thoughts, feelings<br/>
or dreams were.  They never had any parental<br/>
&quot;hear-to-hearts&quot; with us or other examples of<br/>
closeness.  They were more concerned with what we<br/>
would achieve, what our &quot;potential&quot; was (as though we<br/>
had to earn their love and respect by proving<br/>
ourselves worthy by our status and income level later<br/>
in life.)  Every personal or academic failure was<br/>
treated as a personal offense against them.  They lied<br/>
to their peers to have more acceptable explanations<br/>
for our behaviors.  They threatened us with dire<br/>
consequences (like being kicked out or beaten) if we<br/>
did not meet their academic expectations.  Externally,<br/>
they were the stepford parents with the big, nice<br/>
house, stay at home mom, professional dad and all the<br/>
trimmings of a successful life in the 80&#39;s. <br/>
Internally they were dysfunctional, alcoholic,<br/>
codependent, abusive, guilt driven and manipulative.<br/>
<br/>
So why do I unschool?  Why are my kids so important to<br/>
me?  I think these are things that I came to<br/>
unconsciously as a child and I could never concieve of<br/>
being any other way.  Certainly I could never be what<br/>
my parents were to me.  I forcibly persued my own<br/>
unschooling (without the labels for it) throughout my<br/>
education, more agressively after I was 14.  I never<br/>
want my children to feel pushed into the corner that I<br/>
was, or to feel unloved or unwanted.  I never want<br/>
them to feel that sting of knowing you are a<br/>
dissappointment to your parents, or that they tell<br/>
their friends lies about you so you&#39;ll sound more<br/>
impressive or under control.<br/>
<br/>
I have other reasons for Unschooling now, but it began<br/>
there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-559836959">I don&#39;t think that three months in the wilderness can make up for a lifetime<br/>
pattern of (my first thought was to write selfishness, but I don&#39;t think<br/>
that&#39;s quite right) thinking certain ways about things - rigidity.<br/>
<br/>
When we found out we were having a baby, it seemed to me that nothing was<br/>
the way it was before - everything was to be questioned and examined.  I<br/>
knew pretty early on that I wasn&#39;t going back to work after the birth, but I<br/>
was still thinking in terms of sending him to kindergarten.  We lived in<br/>
this pretty ideal neighborhood, lots of young children, the stroller brigade<br/>
every evening, front porch sitting etc.  EVERYBODY there sent their kids to<br/>
school though.  Then when Matthew was 9 months old, I started attending LLL<br/>
meetings.  Not for breastfeeding support, but because I wanted to meet some<br/>
folks who were understanding about keeping a family bed.  Turned out, lots<br/>
of them homeschooled.  They never pushed that as part of the meetings, but<br/>
just watching their kids in action was enough to convince me.<br/>
<br/>
The older he got, the less natural it felt to us to send him away for so<br/>
many hours of the day.  I think we made the decision to homeschool when he<br/>
was about three.  At the beginning, we said we&#39;d just try it for a year at a<br/>
time.  Haven&#39;t said that for awhile now.<br/>
<br/>
We started out homeschooling, but never in what I would call a rigid way - I<br/>
bought workbooks and manipulatives that looked fun to me, and if he didn&#39;t<br/>
want to mess with something we let it go.  Then I discovered the homeschool<br/>
connection at AOL, and katie bar the door &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Someone new came to our homeschool group today and the conversation turned<br/>
to charter schools and curriculum - I had to just walk away.  I have no<br/>
patience for that anymore.<br/>

&gt; Subject: [AlwaysLearning] Why do you unschool?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been wondering what makes someone unschool, or even, just<br/>
&gt; homeschool.  It is this huge investment of self.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Okay.  I watched Frontier House a week ago, I guess.  For those of<br/>
&gt; you who didn&#39;t see it one family who was voluntarily hauled off into<br/>
&gt; the wilderness were relatively divorced from each other.  That is<br/>
&gt; they spent very little time together.  By the end of their<br/>
&gt; experience on &quot;the frontier&quot;, terminal though it was, they had grown<br/>
&gt; much closer and spoke of enjoying each other quite a bit. When they<br/>
&gt; got back to their real lives they abandoned much of what they had<br/>
&gt; experienced on &quot;the frontier&quot;.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; See, I had expected that when you discovered the joys of spending<br/>
&gt; time with each other it would be obvious that anything else was a<br/>
&gt; less than experience.  But by three months post frontiering they<br/>
&gt; were doing very little to embrace each other.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, what brought you to the decision that not only being with your<br/>
&gt; children was more valuable than the potential cash and status you<br/>
&gt; could earn in the workplace (even recognizing that when two parents<br/>
&gt; are working outside of the home one income is almost entirely eaten<br/>
&gt; up by the expenses that are incurred by working outside of the home,<br/>
&gt; but that these children aer people who are able to voice their own<br/>
&gt; opinions, recognize their own needs, and choose their own paths?<br/>
&gt; Why is it that this choice is not the obvious choice?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know if I can answer these questions.  So, maybe it is<br/>
&gt; absurd to ask others before I really explore my own choices.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess for me it has been &#39;the obvious choice&#39; for as long as I <br/>
can remember.   <br/>
I was in an experimental class from 3rd to 6th grade.  It was <br/>
multi-grades, cubby holes, reading loft, math dome, etc., and no <br/>
desks.  We all filled out an &#39;estimate form&#39; every Monday for the <br/>
week.  On it we said how much work we would/could do during <br/>
the week.  There was always stuff going on in the class (like <br/>
making a stained glass windows, pottery, science experiments, <br/>
etc.) that you could get involved in if you wanted to.  You could go <br/>
out to play anytime you wanted to.  It was pure heaven (and as <br/>
close to unschooling that you could get to in a public school)!  I <br/>
think it was probably then that I realized that this is what learning <br/>
is all about.  I did terrible in school and hated it from 7th grade <br/>
on.  After all, I had experienced the best that school could offer <br/>
me in the previous years.  <br/>
I have also never been particularly ambitious.  I am happy to live <br/>
simply and do not feel the need for recognition.  I have always <br/>
been very intuitive and I generally do what &#39;feels right&#39; to me.  So <br/>
far my intuition has served me well.  Every bit of intuition I have <br/>
tells me that this is the right thing for me to be doing.  And if  <br/>
doubts creep in, the universe always finds a way to show me that <br/>
I&#39;m on the right track.<br/>
I knew from the moment Tamzin was born, that we were on this <br/>
journey in partnership.  I look at my role in her life as a facilitator <br/>
and guide, and to provide unconditional love.  I learn from her <br/>
and she learns from me.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-405433287">&lt;&lt; So, what brought you to the decision that not only being with your children was more valuable than the potential cash and status <br/>
you could earn in the workplace (even recognizing that when two parents are working outside of the home one income is almost entirely eaten up by the expenses that are incurred by working outside of the home), but that these children are people who are able to voice their own opinions, recognize their own needs, and choose their own paths?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What brought me to the decision I have made? When my children were very young, 3 and under, I did work. I had a great job working for Martin Marietta, as an assistant to the head of a dept. My husband worked as a Programmer for the same company. At the time I was making very good money. I was able to put my girls in a &quot;great&quot; daycare, with a very good reputation. But as time went on, I saw more and more problems with it. Serious fighting with between kids, my youngest daughter getting sick, having an allergic reaction, and noone called me, and so on. So, my husband and I sat down one night, and talked about what we really wanted. I wanted to be a part of their lives. I didn&#39;t want to be like my mother, she worked all the time, we were raised by babysitters, and now I have vurtually no relationship with either of my parents. I loved my children more that I could imagine. The idea of not being with them was torture. So, we decided I would leave my job. As a result we found that we actually had more finances available, since I wasn&#39;t buying clothes for work, paying daycare, less doctor visits as the girls were healthier, less eating out as I was home more.<br/>
<br/>
As for homeschooling? That idea had never occured to me. I had never even heard of it. I didn&#39;t know that we could teach our own children... Sounds funny now. : )  My husband new about it, and &quot;informed&quot; me that we should do this. I wasn&#39;t sure I could teach my own child... I even enrolled her in Kindergarten. But I talked with other hs moms, who gently laughed at me when I told them I didn&#39;t think I could teach my own child. One mom, said, &quot;You seem to be doing good so far&quot;, then explained to me that, I had taught her to walk, talk, dress herself, and more... why couldn&#39;t I just continue. So I did it... And it was such a joy, I wouldn&#39;t change a thing.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Why is it that this choice is not the obvious choice? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some people don&#39;t see their children as the woderful people they are. They don&#39;t see the joy that children bring to their lives. I had a mom tell me once, that she couldn&#39;t wait for kindergarten to start for her oldes child, she was looking forward to &quot;getting rid of him&quot; for the day. She spoke very badly about him. She told me how difficult he was, always wanting something, needing to eat first thing in the morning, wanting to play outside, asking for his crayons... and the list went on. I was completely shocked. This is so oposite for how I feel about my kids. It is just natural for me to love them. I wish I had the answer for why it isn&#39;t the most obvious choice... perhaps some parents don&#39;t &quot;love&quot; their children. Perhaps it is that some parents have children as a status symble.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Rebecca, I liked what you wrote, and this isn&#39;t criticism of it at all!  I <br/>
was inspired. <br/>
<br/>
I just want to comment on what your friends told you, and teaching kids to <br/>
walk and talk.<br/>
<br/>
If more people were told &quot;You didn&#39;t teach your kids to walk and talk, you <br/>
won&#39;t have to teach them to read or learn math either,&quot; I think it would make <br/>
homeschooling even easier!    <br/>
<br/>
The way my kids learned to walk is the way they learned to do math.  The way <br/>
they learned to talk is the way they learned to read.  They had a natural <br/>
human curiosity and desire to do what other humans were doing, to <br/>
communicate, and make sense of the world.  We provided them a safe, <br/>
supportive environment with encouraging feedback while they figured it out, <br/>
with our help when they needed help.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when  a parent thinks she taught her child to walk and talk, she <br/>
comes to think she will have to teach him everything else in life too.<br/>
<br/>
I think its a wonderful unschooling tool for people to look at how natural <br/>
learning takes place in such HUGE things as walking/running/climbing, and <br/>
speaking a complex language with correct verbs and pronouns.<br/>

It sounds to me like you really understand unschooling. So in my opinion, <br/>
there is fear motivating you right now.<br/>
Once you lose the fear and embrace joy, I think it will make the journey <br/>
easier.<br/>
Try to narrow down what it is you are fearing. That the children won&#39;t be <br/>
successful in life? That they won&#39;t learn what they need?  What exactly is <br/>
creating this fear of totally letting go?<br/>
Live for today. Make today as joyful and fun as possible and the future will <br/>
take care of itself.<br/>
I recently wrote a little essay on joy vs. fear and how unschooling has <br/>
affected all aspects of my life.  Maybe a little journaling would help you <br/>
put these feelings into perspective?<br/>
I know that can really help me and then later, I get to read back on how much <br/>
I&#39;ve changed and see the progress.<br/>
You don&#39;t have to do amazing projects every day, when you come to these <br/>
messages and read about all the cool stuff people are doing, try to remember <br/>
it comes in spurts usually. And you&#39;re reading about many different families <br/>
so it only sounds like there are a million exceptionally cool things going on <br/>
every single moment.<br/>
Most families have quiet time just hanging out (or not so quiet in my case), <br/>
watching tv, playing video games, just going for walks, swimming....just <br/>
&quot;normal&quot; family activity.<br/>
The really amazing moments and fascinating projects can&#39;t be scheduled, <br/>
because the best things happen in a serendipitous kind of way.<br/>
If you look at the world with fascination,<br/>
If you can tap into your own curiosity...you will be well on your way.<br/>

&gt; time.  Haven&#39;t said that for awhile now.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>At this same time I was teaching at a large university in Texas.  It had a<br/>
large education program and many of the students who were getting their<br/>
teaching credential were taking my drama classes. These students just seemed<br/>
so unprepared to me. I couldn&#39;t see turning over my child to someone who<br/>
didn&#39;t know the difference between the Greek and Roman cultures or why we<br/>
went to the moon or that 2 + 2 doesn&#39;t always equal four or even how to<br/>
utilize the classroom experience.  So the choice to homeschool was easy for<br/>
me to make when Jocelyn suggested it.<br/>
<br/>
Embracing unschooling took a bit longer.  It was a very hard for me to stop<br/>
wanting the proof.  I wanted the worksheets or tests or something to &quot;prove&quot;<br/>
that he was learning.  But Jocelyn just kept sending me the occasional post<br/>
from the AOL homeschooling connection, many from Sandra, and it started to<br/>
make a lot of sense to me.  Somebody had posted about how humans learn.  It<br/>
had to do with obtaining food and not being eaten by lion. Illustrating how<br/>
a great deal is learned when the interest comes from within. There was also<br/>
discussion about how damaging test taking can be. I identified with this.<br/>
Then I heard Sandra speak at a conference.  I can&#39;t remember specifically<br/>
what she talked about. But the concepts that I had examined were reinforced.<br/>
It was seeing people in person that embraced unschooling that gave validity<br/>
to the idea for me. I meet and became friends with Pam and her kids. I also<br/>
sought out adults that were homeschooled children and I saw pleasant,<br/>
intelligent, engaging people.  I then felt confidence in our chosen journey.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1564838136">&lt;&lt;I guess it is hard for me to imagine that other people don&#39;t value <br/>
and love their children, too.  There seems to be a trade-off between <br/>
children and self that goes on in people and for many self wins&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a good point too, a deeper picture into why we unschool.  I can&#39;t<br/>
separate my well being from my children&#39;s.  This doesn&#39;t mean being alike<br/>
or agreeing on our preferences but enjoying one another&#39;s differences and<br/>
satisfaction.  Lanora and I are beginning to see our differences of taste<br/>
in the &quot;fashion&quot; realm now.  It&#39;s nice when she likes what I like but I<br/>
would rather see her in something that she enjoys even if it makes no<br/>
aesthetic sense to me.  It would be no fun to see her feeling less than<br/>
satisfied with how she looks even if it means complying with my ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Their happiness and peace are mingled with mine.  I unschool because it<br/>
is what&#39;s best for them AND for all of us.  I would be miserable if I put<br/>
them in school and went back to a job that kept me from doing what I&#39;m<br/>
doing now.  I don&#39;t see the financial choices I&#39;ve made as &quot;sacrifices&quot;,<br/>
I am happy here.<br/>
