<div id="ygrps-yiv-524388972">Argh---the danger of digest is that in a short time you&#39;re replying to old <br/>
stuff...<br/>
<br/>
I think I stepped in a hornet&#39;s nest bringing up the early marriage stuff. I <br/>
didn&#39;t mean to offend anyone...I DO think early marriages can be fine or <br/>
messed up. like any others, and was mostly wondering if anyone DID see a <br/>
trend.  <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps we accidentally brought in the term &quot;arranged marriages,&quot; which seems <br/>
to bother some people.<br/>
<br/>
Well..since I&#39;m offending people...here&#39;s another topic: Have any of you <br/>
folks thought about what if your kids are gay or lesbian?  When you talk to <br/>
them about potential mates or futures, do you use exclusively heterosexual <br/>
terms?  Would it bother you if your child WERE gay or lesbian.<br/>
<br/>
Hey...I may be a pain here, but at last it&#39;s lively, right?<br/>

straight--but we like him anyway)<br/>

bother me in the least if either of my children were gay. We figure Lelia is <br/>
probably straight too. . .she really likes boys. Quinton is two so we don&#39;t <br/>
know yet. But we do not use strictly heterosexual terms for either of them, <br/>
and try to make it known as often as we remember that whatever they choose is <br/>
fine with us. . . Quinton talks a lot about &quot;girlfriend&quot; but his girlfriends <br/>
can be either sex. I bet though that we unconsciously do things to steer him <br/>
the heterosexual way, just out of habit and conditioning . . Lelia thinks it <br/>
would be so cool to have a gay brother. I have always had a lot of gay <br/>
friends. . .my two best friends in Louisiana are gay,and one of them married <br/>
Bryan and I. I was teasing my husband, because according to Dr. Laura, he <br/>
should have been very very leary of me, with my gay friends and independent <br/>
lifestyle. Before I was married, I used to go to the gay bars with my friends <br/>
and was &quot;looking&quot; but it just was not for me. You either are or you aren&#39;t. I <br/>
just loved being around my friends so much, and thought. .. well, maybe I <br/>
could be, but I was not. &lt;BG&gt; Good question.<br/>
<br/>
living in abundance<br/>

I cannot judge my own path and SELF, having the knowledge that I have chosen <br/>
to come here to experience these specific issues and grow, learn, and <br/>

nothing to do with being gay. I have relationships with many people who have<br/>

I tend to think of the decision to have children or not as seperate from<br/>

to the laws in our country and the lack of protection/ decision making<br/>

<br/>
I didn&#39;t bring it up accidently.  And if it&#39;s bothering anyone, that&#39;s a <br/>
bummer.  It&#39;s interesting that those who had already read about it are not <br/>
the conservative Christians in the group.<br/>
<br/>
Information is free.  (Big cornerstone of unschooling, isn&#39;t it?)  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve lived in New Mexico for over 40 years, but there are people who know <br/>
more about New Mexico than I do, in one way or another, who maybe have never <br/>
even been here, because they have a particular interest in underground <br/>
mineral rights or Civil War history or the continental divide or federal <br/>
lands and they could EASILY tell me things about New Mexico, past or present, <br/>
that I never knew.  <br/>
<br/>
When they created a new county a few years ago, they did NOT send post cards <br/>
to every former public-school student of New Mexico history.  The &quot;there are <br/>
32 counties&quot; *truth* dissolved, but if you weren&#39;t paying attention you <br/>
didn&#39;t know that.<br/>
<br/>
If a person doesn&#39;t want to keep up with current events that&#39;s fine.  I <br/>
rarely watch the news (but did happen to catch the unveiling of the <br/>
O&#39;BinLaden video yesterday morning, by chance), and so if my German e-mail <br/>
pal knows much more about the war in Afghanistan than I do, I don&#39;t argue <br/>
with him a bit!<br/>
<br/>
But I do keep an eye on conservative homeschoolers, the paranoid leaders of <br/>
whom are not going to send a postcard to every fundamentalist Christian when <br/>
they get an urgent communique from the Holy Spirit about what ELSE has become <br/>
sin.<br/>
<br/>
Seven or eight years ago when homeschooling was a smaller pond and we had to <br/>
hear directly the news of the Christian right, instead of having to go <br/>
separate places to catch up, there was a movement/fad/practice of dads giving <br/>
pubescent girls a ring.  A dinner, discussion, some oaths and a ring.  She <br/>
would promise to keep herself pure, and the dad would give her a ring to <br/>
symbolize her burgeoning virgin womanhood.  The proponents thought it was <br/>
sweet.  I thought it was creepy, and smacked of incest and future abuse of <br/>
various sorts.   It&#39;s bad enough, to my thinking, that fundamentalist <br/>
Christians (and my family is from West Texas, Southern Baptist and Nazarene, <br/>
lest anyone&#39;s comforting  herself with the idea that I don&#39;t have a clue) <br/>
like to think they own their children, without having the females submit to <br/>
their daddies ceremonially.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-26167434">I just want to say that I am truly sorry if I came off<br/>
as defensive and tetchy.  That&#39;s a bad place for any<br/>
newbie to be, and I really am not that way.  <br/>
<br/>
I realize that many things different groups of<br/>
Christians practice can be viewed as extremism, and I<br/>
do try to avoid that, actually.  Rather than try to<br/>
explain again what I meant in my previous posts and<br/>
messing up again, I&#39;ll let that topic drop, ok?<br/>
<br/>
In fact, I am considered &quot;extreme&quot; for unschooling and<br/>
don&#39;t fit in there either.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve stopped trying to find the perfect group because<br/>
I finally realized (about at age 30) that it doesn&#39;t<br/>
matter if everyone thinks/acts/worships like me, and<br/>
that different circles of friends can fulfill<br/>
different needs in my life.<br/>
<br/>
Since our daughter is only just 12, we have not hit<br/>
that dating game yet.  We&#39;re still in the talking<br/>
about it stage.  Far from an expert on courtship or<br/>
anything else in that area, I won&#39;t try to explain any<br/>
of it.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, please accept my apology!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Nope. As in, nope it wouldn&#39;t bother us if they were gay or lesbian. Yup, as <br/>
in yes the topic has come up from time to time. It&#39;s always from the kids <br/>
asking a question. We answer them directly and honestly according to our <br/>
beliefs. Those beliefs would include allowing people to be Who They Are <br/>
without criticism or judgment. We have many gay/lesbian friends, so that may <br/>
help the discussions and understanding.<br/>
<br/>
Also, on the topic of teens and sexuality I have a late comment. I believe <br/>
there&#39;s a difference between sexuality and promiscuity. To me, if my child <br/>
chooses to be in an intimate relationship, it does not automatically mean <br/>
they are being promiscuous. There are experiences that I had before I was <br/>
married that I would not trade for the world. I&#39;m sure my dh feels the same <br/>
way. It was part of our path. Part of what makes us who we are now. <br/>
Sometimes that path led to intimacy. I do realize though, that there are <br/>
health dangers now that weren&#39;t there way back when I was young.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I used to be horrified at the thought. But I grew up.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s such a non-issue to us now (and it was a *REAL* biggie to my dh at <br/>
one time), that I had to remind myself that the boy who is coming to <br/>
spend the tonight with my son lives with his lesbian mothers.  I just <br/>
say that to show you how far we&#39;ve come from &quot;horrified&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Ain&#39;t I hip?  @@  (rolling eyes)<br/>
<br/>
But seriously, I finally just got wise.  It&#39;s much better for a kid to <br/>
just take it for granted that people do things differently than you, <br/>
than to live in the fear of the day you might have to *explain* <br/>
homosexuality (or alcohol or organic food &lt;g&gt;) to them.  I mean, my <br/>
son&#39;s life is different from the norm as an autodidact....he frequently <br/>
says to other people, &quot;I do it my way, you can do it yours.&quot;  Why should <br/>
I teach him there&#39;s only one way to be a family or have sex or whatever?<br/>
<br/>
It would, though, bring up a whole slew of new opportunities to learn <br/>
about each other, if I found out one of my sons (no girls here) was gay. <br/>
 And it would be a surprise, as they&#39;ve both had girlfriends! <br/>
 Withholding any speculation about the 8 year old at this point.  <br/>

<br/>
My 13 year old straight son is right now questioning religion (Christianity <br/>
in particular) because one of his best friends is a lesbian (she&#39;s 14). His <br/>
concern comes from her (Christian) parents&#39; blatant homophobia and my <br/>
aetheism. Her parents (although they haven&#39;t been informed of either of these <br/>
things) believe that Kim and I are both going straight to hell. Why should <br/>
this sweet, precious person be doomed to hell? (Not to mention his mother?) <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s always known that I&#39;m an aetheist (his dad isn&#39;t), and several of our <br/>
adult friends are gay. He can&#39;t believe that a parent would &quot;disown&quot; a child <br/>
because of something that doesn&#39;t even involve the parents (He said,&quot; She <br/>
doesn&#39;t even WANT to sleep with her mom!&quot; LOL). He&#39;s very concerned for her <br/>
and has even offered to be her &quot;escort&quot; to parties if she felt it would make <br/>
her home-life easier (she is trying to tell her parents, but that&#39;s GOT to be <br/>
difficult!).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it&#39;s been a huge topic of discussion around here for years---and even <br/>
more so now that Kim has confided in him and me. I would not wish <br/>
homosexuality on my children because of the problems they&#39;d face in society <br/>
(not to mention health-wise), but I would be VERY supportive if either boy <br/>
were. We generally DO talk about the future in heterosexual terms because I <br/>
don&#39;t think either IS gay, but I really know they understand we are easy <br/>
either way.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, didn&#39;t you mention in a much earlier post that Beth was involved with <br/>
the Girl Scouts? How does THAT work?<br/>

Christian right. In England about 1% home educates for religious <br/>
reasons, religion is almost never mentioned at groups because it is <br/>
not really a big deal in English life.<br/>
I was pretty shocked coming to america and seeing all these different <br/>
camps of home-schoolers sniping at each other.<br/>
Surely unschooling should teach us to be tolernat of other people&#39;s <br/>
choices, even if we think they are wrtong.<br/>
I am vegan and pagan yet I mix with meat-eaters and funamentalist <br/>
Christians. In fact my best and first freind in America is a <br/>
fundementalist Christian. What unites us is our regard for our <br/>
children which means that we home-school.<br/>
Finding things that unite us is far more important than critising <br/>
differences.<br/>

AbThere seems to be a lot of antagonism among unschoolers against the  <br/>
Christian right.out 10% of the antagonism of the Christian right against <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
HSLDA won&#39;t sign on an unschooling family.  Some of the legislature they&#39;ve <br/>
pushed through is THEIR kind of homeschooling (with a strict curriculum, <br/>
testing regularly).<br/>
<br/>
The Church of England isn&#39;t at all like the southern U.S. Protestant <br/>
independents/Baptist/splinter-sect insanity we have to deal with here.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Finding things that unite us is far more important than critising <br/>

<br/>
Probably so, but if people unite with others they don&#39;t really understand it <br/>
can bite them in the butt later on.<br/>
<br/>
The assumption of many people, especially in the South, is that homeschooling <br/>
equals conservativism, so many of us who are not conservative Christian <br/>
curriculum-buying homeschoolers get the slew of irritating e-mail and <br/>
real-mail and requests to march in pro-life marches (since we&#39;re <br/>
homeschoolers of course we&#39;d like to run some doctors out of the state), or <br/>
to vote Republican, or to vote against whatever they tell us to vote against <br/>
or to call senators or send post cards with the text they mail us to send.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s embarrassing.<br/>

kind of &quot;missed&quot; the opportunity.  I decided that<br/>
instead we would do something for her 13th birthday<br/>

good ideas.  It was even more ritualistic than<br/>
Sandra&#39;s friends&#39; little ceremony, but the difference<br/>
was that it wasn&#39;t requiring anything of the child,<br/>

One thing I have seen was when my nephew turned 13,<br/>
his parents threw a huge party, but then had the<br/>
adults, men in particular, who had known him since<br/>
childhood talk about how they had seen him mature and<br/>
give voice to positive character qualities they had<br/>
seen in evidence in his life.  They also shared advice<br/>
and encouraging words with him.  There wasn&#39;t a dry<br/>
eye in the house by the time it was done, but you<br/>
could tell my nephew was walking 3 inches taller by<br/>
the end.  <br/>

wondered if he were gay and hesitant to talk about it.  My only feeling<br/>
about it was sadness that he might have had a tougher life to live<br/>
given the homophobia that existing in our culture.  I have and had a <br/>
number of gay and lesbian friends and I know how hard it can be for<br/>
them to meet potential partners.  I&#39;ve seen the look of relief on <br/>
their faces when they realized that I &quot;knew&quot; and would remain their friend.<br/>
I wish we lived in a society where everyone could be open about their<br/>
sexual preference(s) without fear of rejection - or in some places fear<br/>
for their lives.<br/>
<br/>
My younger children use hetersexual terms for talking about future <br/>
partners.  I don&#39;t know if that means anything.  Alex (my 4 year old)<br/>
isn&#39;t so sure he wants to get married.  Megan (my 6 year old) definitely<br/>
wants to become a mommy - she&#39;s very relationship oriented.<br/>

named others he didn&#39;t know as well, but knew them by  name and face.  <br/>

biology, three kingdoms were added to the classification system. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And without even POLLING all mammals, or even those who got good grades in <br/>
&quot;Life Sciences,&quot; they went and let a platypus be a mammal!!  So we have new <br/>
relatives AND the definition of &quot;mammal&quot; changes.  <br/>
