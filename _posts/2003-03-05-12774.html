You might be too religious to watch Austin Powers (and without teenaged boys <br/>
to press the issue, many people might not!) but the newest one not only has a <br/>
GREAT opening sequence (which should not be revealed, should just be watched) <br/>
but there are the Japanese twin fans Fuk Mi and Fuk Yu.<br/>
<br/>
Next door to the modelling school where Holly goes is a doctor Fuk Lee.  Big <br/>
sign.  Not as funny as the other two, but funny enough, after the movie.  <br/>
<br/>
If Phuket were a chain, and there were one in Nantucket, they could develop a <br/>
great advertising limerick!  It half writes itself.  (It&#39;s mostly been <br/>
written for ages. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sandra, do you know the whole limerick?  I&#39;ve heard the opening line it<br/>
seems like hundreds of times, but that&#39;s all!  I know what it&#39;s likely to<br/>
rhyme, but seriously, I&#39;ve never heard the whole thing.<br/>
<br/>
Can you enlighten me???<br/>

There was a young man from Nantucket <br/>
<br/>
Whose cock was so long he could suck it! <br/>
<br/>
Wiping cum from his chin <br/>
<br/>
He remarked with a grin <br/>
<br/>
&quot;If my ear was a cunt I could fuck it!&quot;<br/>

It MIGHT be a variation on this:<br/>
<br/>
(Princeton Tiger)<br/>
There once was a man from Nantucket<br/>
Who kept all his cash in a bucket;<br/>
But his daughter, named Nan,<br/>
Ran away with a man,<br/>
And as for the bucket, Nantucket. <br/>
<br/>
but honestly, I doubt it. &lt;g&gt;</div>

The first is of a restaurant called the Fuk Mi Seafood and Sushi Buffet.  It<br/>

The others are a sign pointing to Dick Lick Springs, a headstone with the<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When Mary (Zenmomma) visited last year---as she checked into the hotel, she <br/>
saw these bumper stickers and little signs saying, &quot;Go &#39;Cocks!&quot; She asked <br/>
what in the world THAT was all about. The mascot for the University of South <br/>
Carolina is the &quot;Fighting Gamecocks&quot;, &quot;&#39;Cocks&quot; for short. <br/>
<br/>
She said her husband REALLY needed one of those bumper stickers. I need to <br/>
get on the ball and buy one for her. I&#39;m looking for the one that says, &quot;No <br/>
one can lick our &#39;Cocks!&quot;<br/>
