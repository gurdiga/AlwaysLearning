<div id="ygrps-yiv-873009362">Start looking for video game groups he can join. Video game conferences he<br/>
might like to attend. Science fiction conventions sometimes have gaming<br/>
tie-ins. His favorite TV shows will have websites and fan clubs and message<br/>
boards and email groups and maybe local real-life groups.<br/>

Ok, I realize you&#39;re being jokingly sarcastic....BUT.....<br/>
I have my older son who will seriously, for the most part spend his entire<br/>
life in his bedroom watching tv and playing Nintendo.<br/>
I have to PROD, to get him interested in anything else. I let it go for five<br/>
months and decided he needed a little pushing to get him going.<br/>
I don&#39;t control the tv, but I do remind him that, yes, Mom is working<br/>
tonight<br/>
and if they want to do anything they might want to not wait until an hour<br/>
before I go to work.<br/>
HELP!!!  It is getting  a little bit better, but it pains me to see him in<br/>
that room ALL day long, day after day after day....<br/>
Is it partly the age?<br/>
Nothing in our house is worthy anymore. Not books, not art projects, it&#39;s<br/>
all<br/>
boring.<br/>
The almost teen thing might be part of it, the fact that I was ultra anti-tv<br/>
for a long time is probably part of it. So I grit my teeth and try to shut<br/>
up.<br/>
But it&#39;s hard. He&#39;s out of shape and very hard to interest in anything<br/>
outside his bedroom.<br/>
