<div id="ygrps-yiv-1141172946">&quot;All That Jazz&quot; is from the seventies, and based loosely on Bob Fosse&#39;s<br/>
life (which explains the awesome choreography, since he was involved in<br/>
all stages of it and he choreographed all the numbers). It&#39;s sort of a<br/>
musical - there are lots of musical numbers, anyway. The main character,<br/>
Joe, is a director/choreographer living sort of a haphazard life, with<br/>
various women, drugs, alcohol, and all that... he also has a 12ish year<br/>
old daughter who he puts off and doesn&#39;t spend time with. He has a series<br/>
of heart attacks but doesn&#39;t change and at the end he dies... but the<br/>
whole thing is sort of a show within a show within a show... the finale<br/>
is a big number with everyone from his life, very Broadway-style.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dar, by any chance did she the special last week on Fosse? <br/>
Called....ummm...&quot;Fosse&quot;?&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It starred Ben Vereen and that woman---I can think her name to same my life. <br/>
And a large cast, just doing numbers from Fosse productions. It was AWESOME! <br/>
Maybe HBO? Probably because I don&#39;t remember any commercials. <br/>
<br/>
Has she seen &quot;The Little Prince&quot; with Fosse as the Ssssssssnake? Gene Wilder <br/>
plays the fox.<br/>

we can&#39;t get cable out here in the boonies, but maybe the library?<br/>
Netflix? She has the video of Pippin, too, with Ben Vereen, and he&#39;s<br/>
another favorite...<br/>

not-so-great stage production so it would be good to take that taste out<br/>
of our mouths...<br/>
