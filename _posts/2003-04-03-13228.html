<div id="ygrps-yiv-1938795289">I think it was on this list that animal euthanasia was discussed awhile <br/>
back (maybe a couple years ago--my ability to remember when things have <br/>
happened has gotten worse as I&#39;ve gotten older). It seems to me that <br/>
someone suggested a way to euthanize a cat, but I can&#39;t remember what <br/>
it was.<br/>
<br/>
I have a good friend who has four cats, one of whom is really sick. <br/>
This friend barely has enough money to live and she&#39;s spent a hunk of <br/>
it on vet bills lately. The vet has now said there&#39;s no more that can <br/>
be done (it&#39;s a virus of some type that&#39;s apparently eating into the <br/>
cat&#39;s system) and the cat should really be put to sleep. My friend <br/>
could get the vet to come to her house ($85) or she could take the cat <br/>
in, which would be much cheaper, but the cat HATES going there and she <br/>
doesn&#39;t want his last breath to be one of terror.<br/>
<br/>
IS there any way that anyone knows of to help a pet die at home, <br/>
painlessly, without a lot of cost?<br/>

extra charge. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Susan, Kelly&#39;s right.  Your friend should call around to different vets and <br/>
ask everyone she knows.  By calling around and asking other friends, I <br/>
found a kind, compassionate man who was a partially retired vet.  He came <br/>
out to the house the next day and euthanized my 21-year-old kitty who was <br/>
now blind and hated car trips and the vet&#39;s office.  He was suffering very <br/>
much and I wanted his last day to be peaceful in his own home. My sweet <br/>
kitty passed away in my arms, and I was grateful to this vet for allowing <br/>
me to give this wonderful, good friend and family member a dignified and <br/>
fitting send off.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1071297216">I&#39;ll second the finding another vet, option.  When Caramel the Basset was <br/>
so cancer-ridden that her quality of life was, basically, nil, we called <br/>
around and found a vet who was willing to actually come to our house to <br/>
help her pass on.  It might have helped that an acquaintance of mine used <br/>
to work for him AND that I was blubbering into the phone the whole <br/>
time.  Now I take all our animals to see him, because I know when I need <br/>
him, he&#39;ll be there for us.<br/>
<br/>
As for self-euthanasing a cat...  Are you sure she can?  I mean, money is <br/>
tight, but doing this yourself is very difficult indeed.<br/>
My vet euthanases cats before operations by putting them in an air-tight <br/>
box, then turning on the nitrous (or whatever) to the box, which puts them <br/>
into a calm sleep.  He can then remove the cat and do injections, IV&#39;s, <br/>
operations, etc.<br/>
<br/>
This is the simplest way I can think of that requires little to no money <br/>
and is humane.  I would tentatively suggest that your friend could possibly <br/>
do the same as my vet by making a fairly airtight box out of plywood and <br/>
caulking, line it with comfy cushions or blankets to keep the cat <br/>
comfortable and attach a plastic hose to the box that would go over the end <br/>
of a car exhaust (ensuring it is long enough that no heat reaches the cat <br/>
box.)  Turning on the car would create a gas which would put the cat into a <br/>
stupor fairly quickly, eventually causing them to pass on.  If she wants to <br/>
hold the cat and the cat is fairly insensate already, using a large, clear <br/>
plastic bag (attached to the hose) instead of the box might be <br/>
feasable.  It also might be more difficult for her  emotionally.<br/>
Please be sure she does these things with the garage door OPEN, to ensure <br/>
she does not accompany her cat in its voyage.<br/>
<br/>
My condolences to her,<br/>
Heidi<br/>
