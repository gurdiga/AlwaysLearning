<div id="ygrps-yiv-219817859">I posted this at the other list, but figured some of you may not read there, <br/>
so here it is again:<br/>
<br/>
I have a request for some of you. There is 15y.o. unschooled teen that is a <br/>
member of my support group and she is looking for hosts to stay with over the <br/>
next couple of months. She&#39;s heading out next week and just staying wherever <br/>
and traveling until she feels like coming home.<br/>
This is a very fun and interesting young lady. She&#39;s vegan and a peace <br/>
activist and into a lot of different hobbies. We&#39;ve really enjoyed getting to know <br/>
her and I&#39;m sure she&#39;d make a great guest!<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s mainly traveling around the Eastern half of the country (up towards NY <br/>
and the Carolinas and such) but may be heading out West to meet up with her <br/>
Mum in San Francisco. Her Mom is doing some traveling nursing this summer.<br/>
So if any of you would like to host her for a bit, please write me and I&#39;ll <br/>
give you her email addy. She&#39;s leaving next Thursday, so let me know soon if <br/>
you can.<br/>
Thanks all, <br/>
<br/>
Ren<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-709783160">We are preparing to leave for a 3-month journey up the<br/>
west coast.  We had planned to leave Saturday morning<br/>
(today) but we&#39;re not ready yet LOL.  So maybe it&#39;ll<br/>
be Sunday or Monday - that little change sure took the<br/>
stress off.  <br/>
<br/>
The kids (Quentin 7 & Sierra 4) are all excited.  We<br/>
bought them new luggage - they each have a small<br/>
suitcase with matching backpack.  I&#39;m not sure they<br/>
can fit ALL of their toys in them, but they are sure<br/>
going to try.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll leave Tucson and head for San Diego.  Then make<br/>
a stop at Legoland.  And then,...well, that is as far<br/>
as we&#39;ve planned.  Our destination is actually<br/>
Seattle, where we hope to find a place to rent for a<br/>
couple months.  We&#39;ve never been there so if any of<br/>
you have suggestions of areas to look, or recommended<br/>
stops along the way, please share!  <br/>
