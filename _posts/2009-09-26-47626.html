<br/>
Strewing is finding and leaving out interesting things for people  <br/>
(kids or guests) to discover, pick up, examine, think about, maybe  <br/>
learn from, maybe connect with other things.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when coffee tables were new and all the popular rage, it was  <br/>
common for people to put out a few magazines and a conversation piece-- <br/>
something for guests to talk about, or look at, or ask about.  The  <br/>
idea is sort of like that.<br/>
<br/>
Literally and historically, strewing has to do with  <br/>
scatteringevergreen branches or straw around inside on the floor of a   <br/>
castle hall or, herbs on the floor of a castle bedroom, or strewing  <br/>
seeds (kind of like &quot;broadcast&quot; but less farflung).    In unschooling  <br/>
(I can say with some confidence) it&#39;s more about leaving things out a  <br/>
while, putting them back and leaving other things out, whether or not  <br/>
anyone notices or picks them up.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve used<br/>
attribute blocks (shape blocks of stained hardwood)<br/>
Lego-like castle blocks<br/>
3-D glasses and books or cards or postcards<br/>
scales to measure and weigh<br/>
a new game or puzzle (wooden pop-apart puzzle, or nine-card matching  <br/>
puzzles)<br/>
a prism<br/>
fancy rocks<br/>
microscope and new thing to look at<br/>
maps (small on the table, or large on the wall)<br/>
old photos of me or Keith or other friends or relatives they know<br/>
new, interesting foods<br/>
funny-shaped yam<br/>
flowers from the garden<br/>
<br/>
lots of other things.  There are examples and stories from lots of  <br/>
families here:<br/>

I was wondering if the children are aware of the strewing idea.  While reading your list I was thinking that some of the things may have been brought in by the children.  I have been keeping this idea to myself.  As if it is a secret only Mommy gets to know.  I have 5 kids who range in age from 16 down to 5.  I am pretty sure the older ones have wonderful ideas that I have not thought of yet. <br/>

I was wondering if the children are aware of the strewing idea.  While  <br/>
reading your list I was thinking that some of the things may have been  <br/>
brought in by the children.  I have been keeping this idea to myself.   <br/>
As if it is a secret only Mommy gets to know.  I have 5 kids who range  <br/>
in age from 16 down to 5.  I am pretty sure the older ones have  <br/>
wonderful ideas that I have not thought of yet. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I never said &quot;I&#39;m leaving this here, just in case you&#39;re interested.&quot;   <br/>
It&#39;s not that it was &quot;a secret.&quot;  It was a set of magnets, or it was a  <br/>
wind-up toy, or it was a microscope or a bird&#39;s nest or a puzzle.<br/>
<br/>
Now that my kids are 17, 20 and 23, they&#39;re aware that it was one of  <br/>
the things I did to make their lives rich, but at the time I didn&#39;t  <br/>
talk about it to them.<br/>
<br/>
If your kids get used to you doing that, they&#39;ll probably do it to.   <br/>
Kids have always done it, as far as I know, bringing cool things home,  <br/>
and moms have often, as I know personally, said &quot;GET THAT THING OUT OF  <br/>
THE HOUSE!&quot;<br/>

Cool!  Holly has read them.   Neither Kirby nor Marty has, as far as I  <br/>
know.  Parts, maybe.  Marty says &quot;I don&#39;t have to read it; I lived  <br/>
it.&quot;  So even unschooled kids can be averse to reading. ;-P<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind kids knowing what unschooling is all about, but I object  <br/>
to parents talking about unschooling so much that the kids are tired  <br/>
of hearing about it, or to their explaining what they&#39;re planning and  <br/>
attempting in such ways that it prevents any spontaneity.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1693134696">Strewing is what we do. The behavior came before the terminology. It is <br/>
a description of a lifestyle in which we ALL offer interesting things to <br/>
each other throughout the days, weeks, months, years.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes people seem to be thinking of it as an instructional method - <br/>
a sneaky sort of teaching technique. It is just a description of the <br/>
&quot;Lifestyle of the Interested and Interesting.&quot; (I nominate that for the <br/>
title of a new reality show.)<br/>
<br/>
  It isn&#39;t only unschooling families who do this, either. My sister is a <br/>
strewer extraordinaire and her kids went to school up until almost the <br/>
end of high school. But she and her husband were simply very very <br/>
interesting parents whose focus was on enjoying life with their kids - <br/>
so &quot;strewing&quot; was natural to them.<br/>
<br/>
  My grandparents were strewers in a big way - even when I was growing <br/>
up and they lived overseas in various interesting countries (Libya, <br/>
Iran, Turkey), they would send us packets of stuff - just things they&#39;d <br/>
pick up that they thought were cool. Back then I thought of my <br/>
grandparents and parents as having &quot;collections.&quot; Collecting was a big <br/>
thing in my childhood - everybody in the 50&#39;s was into stamp collecting <br/>
or matchbook collecting or coin collecting or something. My parents and <br/>
grandparents collected interesting stuff and people and experiences.<br/>
<br/>
That rubbed off on my sisters and on me and just naturally seems to lead <br/>
to what unschoolers are now calling &quot;strewing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If the parents are offering cool and interesting ideas to the kids and <br/>
to each other, because it is a fun way to live life, why would the <br/>
children not also start to do that - naturally?  Naming it doesn&#39;t make <br/>
it happen any more than naming &quot;eating&quot; makes people choose to eat.<br/>
<br/>
Parents who don&#39;t live this way naturally can benefit from hearing about <br/>
how it is possible and how fun it is, etc., and to talk about it we use <br/>
the name, strewing, but, really, it is a description of a natural way to <br/>
live, not something parents use on their children.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think my kids heard the word, strewing until they were in their <br/>
late teens. At that point, their reaction was just sort of mild interest <br/>
that doing that kind of thing would have its own name.  To them, it was <br/>
just family life. They couldn&#39;t (maybe still can&#39;t, really) imagine very <br/>
well how a family could live any other way.<br/>
