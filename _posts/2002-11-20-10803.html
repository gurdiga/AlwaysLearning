<div id="ygrps-yiv-1092910765">If you really want a giggle, watch good ol&#39; Marion trying to play a<br/>
Mongol warlord in The Conqueror.  He&#39;s laughable.  Like a cowboy dressed<br/>
up for Halloween in a funny dress.<br/>

OK, it&#39;s a generational thing.  I&#39;ve always LOATHED John Wayne.<br/>
