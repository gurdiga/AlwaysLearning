<div id="ygrps-yiv-613289852">Thanks, Pam, I really LOVE this idea.  I am currently racking my brain<br/>
for a facility like this in our area.  Being in the Midwest, it would be<br/>
best to have an indoor facility so the weather is not an issue.  Did you<br/>
use the facility weekly, monthly, every other week?<br/>
<br/>
We did have local skating rink that opened just for hsers once a month<br/>
before schools let out.  But attendance crept down (all those<br/>
school-at-homers get wrapped up in their need to do academic work) and<br/>
they began to invite school groups. This was a real turn off for most<br/>
homeschoolers....who have a tendency to avoid school groups, day camp<br/>
groups, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks again for the idea. A friend has recently approached me<br/>
with the fact that she is burnt out on structured school-at-home, and<br/>
trying to open her mind to another approach.  Maybe I can get her to<br/>
work with me in finding a place.<br/>

I also  like the idea<br/>
of a weekly play plan, though vaguely tried that last  year...it<br/>
fizzled;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Another thing that we (me and an unschooling friend) was to start a free<br/>
<br/>
day.  WE started out calling it that because the kids wouldn&#39;t come<br/>
there  to <br/>
study.  We found a local boys and girls club, they have after school<br/>
programs <br/>
for school kids but the facility wasn&#39;t used during the day.  They  had<br/>
a gym <br/>
and gym type equipment, pool tables, computers, fooz ball table, table<br/>
hockey, <br/>
games, tables and chairs, bumper pool.  We hammered out  arrangements<br/>
for <br/>
price per child and basically we had the gym to ourselves with  the<br/>
agreement that <br/>
we would be out in time for their after school program and we  would<br/>
clean up <br/>
after ourselves.  <br/>
 <br/>
It worked out great.  WE opened it up to all homeschool kids and found<br/>
that <br/>
unschoolers were the only ones with a free enough schedule to come.<br/>
LOL it <br/>
started off slow but by the end of the year we had 30 kids coming.   The<br/>
thing <br/>
that was better than a park day was that we came even if it was<br/>
raining, and <br/>
even older kids enjoyed.  It was so nice to see all ages  playing<br/>
together.  <br/>
The kids would go from one game to another as they  liked.  We had no <br/>
preplanned games or activities it was up to the kids what  they did.<br/>
Some kids would <br/>
draw while others would just shoot the basket  ball around.  Then more<br/>
would <br/>
join in on the basketball and some would go  play something else.  Very<br/>
free and <br/>
nice.  I drove about 25 minutes  but we had some that would drive about<br/>
1 1/2 <br/>
hours to come.  <br/>
 <br/>
Just another thought,<br/>

Thanks,  Pam, I really LOVE this idea.  I am currently racking my brain<br/>
for a  facility like this in our area.  Being in the Midwest, it would  be<br/>
best to have an indoor facility so the weather is not an issue.   Did you<br/>
use the facility weekly, monthly, every other  week?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
We started out having it twice a month, but after a couple of months it  grew <br/>
and we changed it to every week.  It started out with just me and one  other <br/>
unschooler though for about a month.<br/>
 <br/>
Word of mouth is important.  We kept talking it up on lists and  people would <br/>
come to check it out and love it.  <br/>
 <br/>
We had to search high and low though for a facility that offered a little  <br/>
variety.  This year we are having it at a State Rec Center, about an hour  drive <br/>
for me.  A friend and I had to call and visit many places to find a  big <br/>
enough, flexible enough facility that would basically let us have the run of  the <br/>
place during the day.  <br/>
 <br/>
Benefit to them is that they do not have to staff it for us, no child was  <br/>
dropped off and left without the parent or someone to watch/help them.  And  it <br/>
did bring in some extra money for the facility.<br/>
