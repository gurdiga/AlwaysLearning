think it helps him to be in a position where we don&#39;t have to look at one <br/>
another. Most of the time I&#39;m okay, but there have certainly been a few times <br/>
I felt that way too!<br/>

I really expected that most of the sexuality conversations would be with his <br/>
dad, but they never are--mostly me, sometimes Beth.<br/>
