<div id="ygrps-yiv-502567695">&quot;I&#39;m having a pity party, the rest of the house CAN be miserable. I<br/>
think it&#39;s the &quot;reason&quot; for mama not being happy that you have to<br/>
examine.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s how I take the saying. If mama&#39;s happy, it&#39;s<br/>
contagious...if mama&#39;s miserable that is also contagious. Makes me<br/>
more aware of how I act/think/respond. I think it&#39;s a true saying, but<br/>
not an excuse to be selfish and create a feeling of your children<br/>
owing you.<br/>
<br/>
I KNOW *I* am responsible to get what I need, so I can be truly there<br/>
for everyone else. When I&#39;m happy/content/at peace with my world, I<br/>
can be such a better Mum regardless of circumstance. I alone am<br/>
responsible for getting what I need and creating that space.<br/>
