&lt;&lt; I&#39;m going to try to borrow it today.  It&#39;s <br/>
called &quot;Lying Awake&quot; by Mark Salzman.  The blurb on Amazon says the book <br/>
&quot;...probes the nature of spiritual illumination.&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I read it.  It&#39;s really good.  It&#39;s narrower than all the questions asked <br/>
here, but also artsy and touching and worth reading.<br/>
<br/>
Also short. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
