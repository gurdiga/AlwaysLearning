<div id="ygrps-yiv-2011118221">Hi All,<br/>
does anyone have any resources for portfolio creators? My daughter would like the option of going to college and we would like some help in creating a great portfolio for that. As I am not much of a record keeper (for me it interferes with joyful unschooling), I would like someone to be able to turn her life experiences into some sort of cohesiveness.  We have communicated some with www.tlci.org but they really focus on a diploma and use the Carnegie credit system, and that is pretty unimportant to us.<br/>
Any ideas?<br/>
