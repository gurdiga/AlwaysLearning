<br/>
-=-(I literally woke up at 3 am in fits of tears) -=-<br/>
<br/>
Aside from tears and stress, women often wake up more easily after they have children.<br/>
Then women wake up more easily when menopause is there (in any stage of it, and if you&#39;re lucky, it will be a gradual thing over many years).<br/>
<br/>
And on top of that, there&#39;s more and more research, speculation, acceptance of the idea that sleeping eight hours straight isn&#39;t necessarily &quot;right&quot; or normal.  It was certainly &quot;taught&quot; to millions of people in school ad the right way to sleep, and the only healthy reality.  If that is health, then a lack of that must be disease! And sure enough, there are drugs to &quot;cure&quot; the things that keep people from sleeping naturally, so that they sleep like the people in school health books.<br/>
<br/>
I was happy and healthier when I stopped being upset or embarrassed or frustrated for waking up at 3:00 a.m. and accepted it as a useful thing.  I might just get up and go to the toilet, or check the cats, or see if it&#39;s snowing or get a drink of water.  When my kids were all still here, I might check to make sure the door was locked, see who was home, maybe adjust the heat.   One or two useful things and go back to bed.<br/>
<br/>
Now that they&#39;re grown and elsewhere, sometimes I get up altogether and write for a while, or clean the kitchen, and later if I want to, I go back to sleep.  That&#39;s a luxury of not having young children to take care of.  It happens, someday.  I also remember having three very young children for many years.  <br/>
<br/>
However your life is now, it won&#39;t be that way for long.  So if it&#39;s great, appreciate it.  If it&#39;s not great, don&#39;t project that out for years.  Things change.<br/>
