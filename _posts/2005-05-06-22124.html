There&#39;s a link to a coupon for a box of Celestial Seasonings tea, but you <br/>
need to go there and print it by May 18<br/>
and then redeem it by the end of June.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to say something about this list being so quiet.  I don&#39;t mind.<br/>
Some people are here because they like my website.  Lately I&#39;ve put more <br/>
energy into the website than anything else, and updates are here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/announcements">http://sandradodd.com/announcements</a><br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also a way to get announcements to site news and news of publication <br/>
and speaking engagements and such by subscribing to a yahoogroups announcement <br/>
list by e-mailing here:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
-For those who came to this list for John Holt input, here&#39;s something new:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/holt/teachyourown">http://sandradodd.com/holt/teachyourown</a><br/>
and this (not new):<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/johnholt">http://sandradodd.com/johnholt</a><br/>
and there are other lists (some busier) here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/lists/other">http://sandradodd.com/lists/other</a><br/>
<br/>
Just to tide you all over until this list gets busy sometime. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
