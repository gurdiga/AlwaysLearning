Audience participation plays a large role in Tom and Debbie O&#39;Carroll&#39;s <br/>
performance. They [children] will learn some phrases in the Irish language, <br/>
discover Celtic knot art, find out what the colours in the Irish Flag mean, meet <br/>
Molly Malone from Dublin, figure out a riddle poem by the Irish writer Jonathan <br/>
Swift, join in a song about a Belfast belle, visit an Irish sweet shop, practice <br/>
an Irish jig and much, much more! <br/>
~~~<br/>
<br/>
Doesn&#39;t that sound like fun?? I can&#39;t wait to get a chance to see him again!<br/>
<br/>
BTW, Will met him, too, and Tom sat with us on his break at the pub, and he <br/>
was very receptive to Will, and let him try the bodhran.  <br/>
