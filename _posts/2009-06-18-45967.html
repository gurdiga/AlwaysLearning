<div id="ygrps-yiv-1822487981">I got TWO local announcements this morning, and they&#39;re not  <br/>
appropriate for this list, but I still put them in a public place, here:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://unschooling.blogspot.com/2009/06/new-york-and-connecticut.html">http://unschooling.blogspot.com/2009/06/new-york-and-connecticut.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Please keep an eye out for a good, simple message board for such  <br/>
announcements, which I could host on my site.  If this list devolved  <br/>
into  local announcements instead of remaining a discussion of the  <br/>
principles behind unschooling, it would be of much less value.<br/>
<br/>
It takes time for me to reject notices of local interest.  Could each  <br/>
person who reads this try to remember to consider what lists you&#39;re  <br/>
sending announcements to, and NOT send regional topics here?<br/>
