<div id="ygrps-yiv-1368837547">**That reminds me of the guy that has the series of books &quot;teach your baby to <br/>
read&quot;, &quot;teach your baby_______&quot; and promotes ramming knowledge down their <br/>
throats at an early age.**<br/>
<br/>
Not knowledge. Facts. Lists. Labels. Names.<br/>
<br/>
Knowledge is a whole other thing entirely that he doesn&#39;t claim to be <br/>
supplying.<br/>
<br/>
The basic idea is sound, that the more hooks kids have to hang new facts on <br/>
the bigger their eventual knowledge net will become. <br/>
<br/>
But I always had better things to do with my time than make up cards to flash <br/>
at my toddlers. Like taking them out into the big wide world to see things in <br/>
real life.<br/>
