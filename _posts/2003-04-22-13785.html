<div id="ygrps-yiv-1718720460">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter, 8.5, had a lot to say the other night about herself and her body. She is in school this year, her choice. Never had been before and totally able to handle the system. Anyhow, she wishes she was skinnier. She has been off the growth charts until 5 years old, for her age, now she is right at 98% for height and weight. Well, she thinks her legs are fat and she doesn&#39;t like this. Also, she told me someone at school has been teasing her about having fat legs, yuck! Her class gets to go swimming and I think she is feeling strange about being in her bathing suit in front of her class. She wants me to make her a swim skirt. This is a kid who has spent her whole life in a swim suit and was on the swim team for a year. She loves to swim. I&#39;m trying to come up with some resouces so we can explore what she is feeling. Any thoughts?<br/>
<br/>

Tell her that&#39;s one of the costs of going to school, that even if she had a <br/>
perfectly model-skinny body the other kids would find something to be mean <br/>
about because that&#39;s what kids at school do.<br/>
<br/>
If school is harming her confidence and self image, I would consider taking <br/>
her out of school.<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;Her class gets to go swimming...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If she weren&#39;t in school she could go swimming more often, right?  And <br/>
without &quot;her class&quot;?<br/>

<br/>
So, true!  While I usually can&#39;t muster much sympathy for super models,<br/>
many of them complain that they were gawky and ugly and teased<br/>
unmercifully in school.  Usually they were taller and flatter than<br/>
everyone else.<br/>

was skinny with breasts....First, I was &quot;anorexic&quot; and then I was a<br/>
&quot;slut&quot;.....<br/>
