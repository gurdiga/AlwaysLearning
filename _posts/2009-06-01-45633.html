<br/>
Sandra, I want to put the following AIM chat that my brother wrote to  <br/>
me on the …  group for advice how and if i should respond to him…<br/>
<br/>
  This came as a big shock to me because he has always been on my side  <br/>
with homeschooling. I guess my parents&#39; opinions got to him. This is  <br/>
my younger brother whom is living with my parents,no job yet.<br/>
<br/>
I was there today visiting and everything was cool. I came home, we  <br/>
started chatting and this is what he kept writing. I did not respond.  <br/>
I clicked out and closed AIM. What do you think i should do?<br/>
<br/>
It is very insulting as you can see. If you want to put it on the  <br/>
list, it will help me..thanks!<br/>
<br/>
[the brother] (5:19:44 PM): do you really think Lukas as a fair sjot  <br/>
at getting a good education from you and keeping up with the level the  <br/>
other kids are gonna maintain?<br/>
<br/>
[the brother](5:20:16 PM): what about all the details that he should  <br/>
learn that we don&#39;t remember anymore<br/>
<br/>
[the brother](5:20:34 PM): like scientific stuff anf algebra,  <br/>
trigonometry<br/>
<br/>
[the brother](5:20:59 PM): all the complicated hard stuff that we  <br/>
didn&#39;t even learn<br/>
<br/>
[the brother](5:21:10 PM): or use for all these years and forgot<br/>
<br/>
[the brother](5:21:49 PM): I think he should go to school and then  <br/>
have a chance to go to college so he doesn&#39;t have to work like a  <br/>
donkey when he&#39;s a man<br/>
<br/>
[the brother](5:22:35 PM): it&#39;s not fair to him to have to work like a  <br/>
mexican when he is smart and has the potential to be something way  <br/>
better<br/>
<br/>
[the brother](5:22:56 PM): I kow I could never teach a kid all the  <br/>
things they should learn these days<br/>
<br/>
[the brother](5:23:10 PM): I &#39;m not intelligent enough to either<br/>
<br/>
[the brother](5:23:37 PM): I think he is being deprived in a way<br/>
<br/>
[the brother](5:23:55 PM): i don&#39;t mean to get you angry but just want  <br/>
you to know how we all feel<br/>
<br/>
[the brother](5:24:10 PM): so please don&#39;t be hurt nd upset with me<br/>
<br/>
[the brother](5:24:21 PM): i like  being your friend as well as brother<br/>
<br/>
[the brother](5:24:55 PM): If  could go get a better education and was  <br/>
young enough to I would do it in a hot minute<br/>
<br/>
[the brother](5:25:24 PM): talk to me heather come on the truth is the  <br/>
truth<br/>
<br/>
[the brother](5:25:45 PM): he is getting to the age where his  <br/>
education is getting more important<br/>
<br/>
[the brother](5:26:16 PM): do you really think he will get beat up or  <br/>
abused by a teacher?<br/>
<br/>
[the brother](5:26:38 PM): or are you afraid to let him out of your  <br/>
sight pretty much<br/>
<br/>
[the brother](5:27:14 PM): you are being to proyective...the world is  <br/>
gonna be a big surprise and a shock to him when he gets out on his own  <br/>
someday<br/>
<br/>
[the brother](5:28:09 PM): he is gonna be disappointed that he works  <br/>
at taco bell or something really lame like some of the jobs i&#39;ve had  <br/>
to do<br/>
<br/>
[the brother](5:28:42 PM): he could get a job in the aerospace field  <br/>
ot be a cop fireman whatever<br/>
<br/>
[the brother](5:29:36 PM): it would be worth being called a few names  <br/>
or picked on and learn how to be a little tough instead of being home  <br/>
on your hands all day everyday until he grows up<br/>
<br/>
[the brother](5:30:34 PM): don&#39;t you want to be able to clean the  <br/>
house do laundry and have some time for yourself without having to  <br/>
think about what he&#39;s doing every second?<br/>
<br/>
[the brother](5:31:04 PM): you are even depriving yourself of a normal  <br/>
likfe in a way<br/>
<br/>
[the brother](5:31:15 PM): your not gonna talk now?<br/>
<br/>
[the brother](5:31:27 PM): I will keep going if you don&#39;t<br/>
<br/>
[the brother](5:31:42 PM): you need to hear these things i believe<br/>
<br/>
[the brother](5:31:56 PM): it&#39;s not to hurt anyone<br/>
<br/>
[the brother](5:32:34 PM): I really want to see him be a siccess and  <br/>
be happy with his education level and his job when he&#39;s grown up<br/>
<br/>
[the brother](5:32:41 PM): success<br/>
<br/>
======================================================<br/>
<br/>
Note from Sandra:  When I read that I assumed the brother was maybe 22  <br/>
years old.  Turns out he&#39;s in his late 30&#39;s and childless, living at  <br/>
home with his parents, and was recently in legal trouble for something  <br/>
drug-related.  The sister he&#39;s haranguing here is older than he is,  <br/>
and is the one who took the collect calls from him when he was in jail  <br/>
and relayed messages to their parents.<br/>
<br/>
It does shed a different light on it.  Not a better light…<br/>
<br/>
Ideas?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really sorry I didn&#39;t get to this Friday.  All day Saturday I was  <br/>
gone and today we had company and I was tired, and kept forgetting to  <br/>
check my to-do lists and e-mail.  Sorry.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1361337261">Just sounds like same old worries that lots of relatives have. I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t get too hurt or insulted, it is understandable ignorance <br/>
talking.  Instead, tell him you can understand why he&#39;d worry, and that <br/>
you&#39;re appreciative that he cares enough to tell you what he really <br/>
thinks, but that you&#39;ve considered all those same issues and you feel <br/>
pretty confident that what you&#39;re doing will work. You could take the <br/>
concerns one at a time and respond, if you want to, or you could dismiss <br/>
them all at once and say, &quot;We&#39;re just going to do this as long as it <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; wouldn&#39;t get too hurt or insulted, it is understandable ignorance&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Given Sandra&#39;s additional background information...to me the whole thing <br/>
didn&#39;t sound like regular ignorance. It sounded like projection. It sounded <br/>
like he is (perhaps unwittingly) expressing his own fears and resentments - <br/>
shame about his own failures and difficulties, his resentments at having <br/>
been bullied, his feelings of low self-worth and stupidity about the masses <br/>
of stuff he has forgotten, maybe guilt at what he has imposed on his <br/>
family - all wrapped up in what might be genuine affection for his sister <br/>
and nephew.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;you could dismiss<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; them all at once and say, &quot;We&#39;re just going to do this as long as it<br/>
&gt; works for us.&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Contrary to his belief, it is not her need to hear this, but evidently his <br/>
need to express it. There is so little logic here that I&#39;m all for Pam&#39;s <br/>
last line.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-376233005">Being as the brother has always been on her side and the  brother is now <br/>
living at his parents&#39; house who hasn&#39;t been on her side, I would  definitely <br/>
check to make sure the message *was* from the brother and not a  parent who <br/>
happened upon his open screenname/account (or maybe his password  isn&#39;t <br/>
hidden or is shared) and decided to speak &quot;through&quot; the brother, hoping it  <br/>
would carry more weight, *before* I decided on any course of action. I know that <br/>
 my personal AIM, Yahoo and Google IM accounts all sign on whenever anyone <br/>
signs  on at this computer-and they could all be under different names <br/>
(they&#39;re not,  currently, but they could be) and they all have the password <br/>
&quot;remembered&quot;, so it  would be easy for anyone to IM under my name.<br/>

The argument doesn&#39;t make sense. Send your child to school to learn stuff that he won&#39;t remember, learn stuff you&#39;ll never use and to not learn those complicated things that your brother thought he should have learned while he was in school but didn&#39;t.<br/>
For me this is an argument against sending my child to school.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It will probably help calm you down if you look at it through his  <br/>
eyes. Since he believes what he&#39;s writing about unschooling, he has a  <br/>
right to be scared and baffled and not thinking clearly! (And, I  <br/>
agree, he&#39;s doing some projecting of himself.)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could say that. Like:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If that&#39;s what you believe unschooling leads to, I understand why  <br/>
you&#39;d be worried and scared for Lukas. But I&#39;m sad that you think I  <br/>
care that little about my son or that I&#39;m so clueless that I would  <br/>
adopt such a harmful lifestyle. Wouldn&#39;t it make more sense that  <br/>
those who haven&#39;t read about unschooling have drawn wrong conclusions  <br/>
than that I would risk my child&#39;s life and future on something that  <br/>
sounds that dangerous?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I know, not just believe, that learning is far more effective  <br/>
through doing than through sitting in a classroom learning things  <br/>
only to forget them! I want Lukas to spend his time more effectively  <br/>
learning what&#39;s meaningful to him, learning through his interests and  <br/>
passions. Despite what a world full of people erroneously believe, it  <br/>
doesn&#39;t take 12 years of school to get into college. Unschoolers do  <br/>
go to college and do just fine there. And they go to college for the  <br/>
right reasons: because they want to learn what the college offers,  <br/>
not because it&#39;s another set of hoops to jump through to get some job  <br/>
that will pay the mortgage.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s never to late to be what you want to be. It&#39;s harder as an  <br/>
adult, yes. As adults we&#39;re surrounded by people who will tell us  <br/>
it&#39;s too much trouble. We may even have decided they&#39;re right. But  <br/>
it&#39;s a lot easier to achieve something when you decide you can than  <br/>
when you decide you can&#39;t.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-416882803">My first thought was that it was a hot-headed 22 year old, possibly  <br/>
drunk or stoned.    When I inquired as to age, and got the details of  <br/>
drug related crime, I thought even more likely it was the ramblings of  <br/>
someone under the influence of something chemical, and I agree with  <br/>
Robyn that it&#39;s probably an angst/guilt explosion misdirected.<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s unlikely that a childless unemployed 30-something will have  <br/>
examined his own schooling for flaws.  If he&#39;s bought the general  <br/>
&quot;wisdom&quot; of it all, if he was unhappy it was his fault, and if he&#39;s  <br/>
grown up frustrated and worrisome, it&#39;s his fault.   So if he didn&#39;t  <br/>
do better WITH the supposed-to-be-magical-guarantee education, he&#39;s  <br/>
afraid his nephew will be MORE unemployed and MORE criminally  <br/>
involved, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe what his sister could do would be to write and point some of  <br/>
that out lightly, that school is no guarantee, and in fact does a lot  <br/>
of damage to people&#39;s self-image and desire to learn and do and be.    <br/>
Maybe she could name some particular people they both know who did  <br/>
well without college, or who have college and aren&#39;t doing well, and  <br/>
if the factors have to do with drugs and alcohol, perhaps point out  <br/>
that many people first encounter drugs and alcoholic binges in school.<br/>

OH!  Another possible option then in addressing him.  If he was drunk,  <br/>
he might not even remember what was written.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of times when someone I know and liked posted something  <br/>
HORRIBLE (not the same person both times, and not about unschooling;  <br/>
elsewhere), I knew it was that person, but to cover for it and help  <br/>
them save face and backtrack, I posted something like &quot;John, someone  <br/>
must have used your computer when you weren&#39;t home and posted this  <br/>
horrible thing.  You need to be more careful logging off at  <br/>
night.&quot; ...or some such.<br/>
<br/>
It made it both lighter and more serious, but didn&#39;t put the harangue  <br/>
on the (possibly drunk or too tired) poster.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the sister could say &quot;It seems mom is using your AIM, because  <br/>
you&#39;re usually more supportive and thoughtful.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1040969299">I came to this list 3 or4 years ago in the same position.  In addition to the arguments of an entire family of school teachers and college professors, unfortunately going through a divorce with an angry spouse I was faced with a judge who hated me, hated homeschooling and of course knew nothing about it.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing has changed.  My 2 younger sibs are two highly paid executives for large companies, and although I have provided my folks with enough information on the successes of unschooled children and people, they continue to respond as if they have heard nothing.  I recently re-set boundaries with my younger sister (of 8 years) because she was calling my eldest to counsel her so she wouldn&#39;t be a bum on the street without her HS diploma or GED. I have also received the very same call (lol) from my brother!!!<br/>
<br/>
What HAS changed is how I respond to them.   It has taken me 4 years to stop reacting emotionally to them.  It has been hard.  I used to feel so angry, as if I was the only one going through this. My focus instead of being on my children was removed from them and wasted energy.<br/>
<br/>
There will always be your brother or someone else unable to see that unschooling is the best way for you and the way you THE PARENT (capitalized to emphasize the due respect that comes with the title)  has chosen  to educate your children.  That is enough. <br/>
<br/>
That being said I ditto all the wonderful advice that has been given to you by those in this list. <br/>
Take a deep breath!!<br/>

One thing I&#39;ve seen with addicts I&#39;ve known personally is that the  <br/>
substance (alcohol in my mom&#39;s case, plain cheap beer) seems to take  <br/>

(sorry, can&#39;t recall the name) who said one thing that stuck deep in  <br/>
my craw -- he said &quot;Kids in England get sent to a boarding school  <br/>
where they are pee&#39;d on in the showers every day, and then they send  <br/>
their kids to the same school because they think it builds character.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Anguish and fear may build character -- what kind of character?   <br/>
Seems to answer a lot of questions for me, anyway.<br/>

What an interesting thought.  My brother at the time, had his children in the same preschool as Robin Williams and Michelle Pfeiffer.  He boasted that his son was exposed to and doing well in Physics.  <br/>
 <br/>
He is truly covering feelings about his education.  Because of his undiagnosed dyslexia years ago, he was told he was stupid and my mother was told that he should be placed in an institution because he couldn&#39;t read.  After years of tutoring and an expensive private school, he discovered he had an extremely high IQ.<br/>
<br/>
My children were treated so badly in school. For 8 years, the school refused to meet my daughter&#39;s needs,despite a lawyer, etc.  My son was ridiculed and called stupid by his teacher in front of the class.   My brother&#39;s response was of course that another teacher was the answer.  He truly sounded like a broken record.  Running like a race horse with blinders on.  Not unlike an addict, he was incapable of seeing or visualizing any way but the way he has chosen for himself and his children. <br/>

school and recognized that enough to keep her kids home.<br/>

Just the other day my sister wrote this on her facebook... &quot;Why is it<br/>
that when I drive by schools, I feel utterly depressed, especially when<br/>
I see chairs all set up for a graduation ceremony? I guess because my<br/>
only happy memories from school include spray-painting the outside of<br/>

I do love message boards.  I took on unschooling.info hoping to revive  <br/>
it, but it&#39;s losing old threads mysteriously, and there are dozens,  <br/>
sometimes 100, spam messages a day to be deleted or left there.  It&#39;s  <br/>
not going to survive as and where it is.<br/>
<br/>
The NING sites are okay, but for the social aspect, Facebook and  <br/>
Myspace are better, and unschoolers can still keep in contact with  <br/>
each other quickly and easily with those, or Twitter.<br/>
<br/>
I want to add a message board to my site, but I don&#39;t know how and I  <br/>
don&#39;t have the time to learn, this season.  If there&#39;s someone here  <br/>
with big confidence in that area, I would love for someone to just set  <br/>
that up for me.   I&#39;m on a yahoo small businesses site, and there&#39;s a  <br/>
whole SQL section that&#39;s a big mystery to me, but apparently is the  <br/>
place and tool for plugging in a message board.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with joyce that the &quot;threaded&quot; message boards are more  <br/>
confusing than not.  I&#39;d rather have one like the forum at  <br/>
unschooling.info, where the topic goes in one direction until it comes  <br/>
to a natural end, or can be stirred up again years later.   I&#39;ve  <br/>
heard, though, that Snitz forums have problems and no tech support/ <br/>
advice directly.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind discussing this here (with apologies to those for whom  <br/>
it&#39;s total gibberish), because it would be a good resource for people  <br/>
on this list, and a place to put the best topics where they&#39;re easily  <br/>

dislike is that you can only see what&#39;s been posted last and then once<br/>
there, you&#39;d have to go through the posts to see if there is anything<br/>
else new since the last time you checked.  If the whole convo gets<br/>

checking because it gets to overwhelming for me to look through almost a<br/>
hundred postings.<br/>

Perhaps I don&#39;t know how to follow things right on the ning site. <br/>
Perhaps I&#39;m missing something!  What I like about yahoo groups is that<br/>
you can see date and time and it&#39;s like an outline format and it&#39;s<br/>
threaded.<br/>
<br/>
What I liked about the unschooling dot com boards, was the same thing<br/>
that I liked about unschooling dot info.  There were subjects and then<br/>
sub subjects and whole threads that you could see.  What would make a<br/>
site like ning better for me, is to have listed how many new posts there<br/>
are for each new day, so you know what you are looking for.</div>

I found something that said they did not. Instead of a message board yahoo<br/>
suggests using a guest book.<br/>
I would wait for Google Wave to come out later this year rather than set up<br/>
a traditional message board.<br/>
<br/>
You could start a wave on a topic on it&#39;s on page like you do now .. and<br/>
people can add to it like they would on a message board except better.<br/>
Photos, videos, maps can be added to a wave by dragging and dropping. Waves<br/>
can be embedded on blogs and social networking sites. There&#39;s a way to add<br/>
games to the wave, too.<br/>
<br/>
It solves the messy branching problems with it&#39;s Playback feature. If<br/>
someone comes in late to wave and wants to see the original text they can<br/>
hit the playback button and the messages will be played back starting with<br/>
the original. Or you can look for waves from specific contributors instead<br/>
of trying to weed through a big thread.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s collaborative content, like a message board. Or it can be a<br/>
conversation like twitter and facebook. But it&#39;s not separate like each of<br/>
those things.<br/>
<br/>
Really this is going to be so cool I am not doing it justice in trying to<br/>

&gt; might prefer to check a message board once a day rather than have a<br/>
&gt; flood of e-mails about things they don&#39;t have time for.<br/>

can be embedded on blogs and social networking sites-=-<br/>
<br/>
That might work then, if I could put them on webpages and have a  <br/>
directory to those pages.  Thanks!<br/>

It might be good for comments, but not for a message board, it seems,  <br/>
but it&#39;s sure COOL!!!<br/>
<br/>
Would the initiator be able to delete it?  Or even his or her own  <br/>
comments?   All these things could make it less valuable.  We need to  <br/>
be able to edit out spam or really bad ideas or abusive nonsense.<br/>
Still.... it&#39;s got to be useful for things we do about unschooling,  <br/>
and if it exists by the time we have the SUSS get-together, that might  <br/>
be a way to keep in touch between condos or wherever between symposium  <br/>
sessions.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;d still like to have a message board, although Holly and I are  <br/>
watching this abridged Google Wave presentation, and it&#39;s cool.<br/>
