&gt; A very merry  UnBirthday to everyone else too!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This cracks me up. Yesterday in the mail I received a very sweet birthday <br/>
card (with 20 bucks!) from my partner&#39;s mother. <br/>
<br/>
My birthday is in February.<br/>
<br/>
Turns out, when talking to Beth, she realized that she hadn&#39;t remembered my <br/>
last birthday, so she sent a &quot;Belated or early&quot; card.<br/>
<br/>
Strange, but very, very sweet.<br/>

Kathryn, whose PREVIOUS mil hates her to this day, and was the best thing she <br/>
lost in the divorce<br/>
