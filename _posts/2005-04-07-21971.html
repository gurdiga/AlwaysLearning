I look forward to learning and sharing with everyone!<br/>

Hi, Louise!<br/>
 <br/>
I used to have some 5, 3 and &lt;1 kids who are 18, 16 and 13.<br/>
Seems like a lifetime, and for them, it is!<br/>
 <br/>
Here&#39;s a collection of typical days collected in one place for the  <br/>
overwhelmment of my readers. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 <br/>
Welcome to the list. <br/>
Do you know about the AlwaysUnschooled list? You might like that too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1720367583">Hi Sandra, thank you for the welcome!!  Wow, I get teary just<br/>
imagining my kids being those ages!  I think I&#39;m going to have a major<br/>
case of empty nest syndrome some day! (on the one hand, it&#39;s so great<br/>
that i will be able so spend so much of their lives with them, as<br/>
opposed to them living in school most of the time, but then at the<br/>
same time, it will be that much harder to see them go, having been so<br/>
close!!)  Thanks for the link, I will check it out tonight. Are you<br/>
the Sandra who writes for HEM?  I haven&#39;t seen a copy in a while,<br/>
because we just moved and were getting settled, but I just got the<br/>
latest copy and was SO bummed that your column wasn&#39;t in there. It is<br/>
the first one I always turn to, it&#39;s my favorite! <br/>
<br/>
Yes, I also joined the AlwaysUnschooled list, but my intro went<br/>
un-replied to.  I think I may not be radical enough for that list, so<br/>
I will probably remain a lurker there. I definitely have no rules<br/>
regarding my kids&#39; education and learning, but I haven&#39;t yet reached<br/>
the point where I would let them forgo brushing their teeth, etc., etc. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway thanks for the welcome!! :)<br/>
<br/>

I did for a long time.<br/>
The columns are scattered hither and yon on their site and mine, and other  <br/>
articles from other publications.    Lots (not all) are listed  here:<br/>

 <br/>
There&#39;s a groups of related lists on which introductions aren&#39;t required  nor <br/>
expected.  We hope to discuss the issues and not the people,  generally.  And <br/>
honestly, on most of these lists I&#39;m thinking of (that one,  <br/>
UnschoolingDiscussion, this one, another one or two) lurking&#39;s not a bad idea  anyway, if <br/>
one&#39;s not really into radical unschooling.  Often someone  expresses what seems to <br/>
be criticism of radicals and the defenses that are  posted seem like a slam <br/>
to them.  <br/>
 <br/>
Don&#39;t expect each new person to do an intro, and we definitely don&#39;t do  <br/>
rounds of hellos and goodbyes like smaller lists set up to socialize do.   It&#39;s <br/>
not to be unfriendly, it&#39;s to stick to topic.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1810666996">When you mentioned reading columns, I should&#39;ve made a plug here for Live  <br/>
Free, Learn Free.  Several of the readers of this list have had articles  there. <br/>
 I&#39;ve been in once, and will be in the next issue.    <br/>
_http://www.livefreelearnfree.com_ (http://www.livefreelearnfree.com) <br/>
 <br/>
And there&#39;s <br/>
 <br/>
_http://www.lifelearningmagazine.com/_ (http://www.lifelearningmagazine.com/) <br/>
 <br/>
Both of those are unschooling magazines, one out of Texas and the other  from <br/>
Ontario (but it&#39;s easy to subscribe online).  <br/>
 <br/>
Another Canadian thing is a family doing recorded interviews for radio, but  <br/>
they can be heard or downloaded easily.  They interviewed me recently, and  <br/>
it&#39;s linked here:<br/>
_http://sandradodd.com/radio_ (http://sandradodd.com/radio) <br/>
There are other interviews there too.<br/>
