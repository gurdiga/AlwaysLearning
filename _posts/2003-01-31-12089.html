&lt;&lt; Do I need to assure you guys that I eject these (if they haven&#39;t already <br/>
ejected themselves after drenching us all in pureed spam...) as soon as they<br/>
appear, or can I just do it quietly? &lt;g&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Pam, thank you very much for defending this list.  I&#39;ve had company and <br/>
Holly&#39;s sick and I had a doctor&#39;s appointment, I&#39;m still a couple of hundred <br/>
e-mails behind, and I never found the shampoo spammer.   I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s <br/>
maybe because you dropped her before I looked.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!!<br/>
<br/>
