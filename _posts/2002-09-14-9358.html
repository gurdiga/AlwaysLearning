<div id="ygrps-yiv-692507740">Some of my favorite movies of all time...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The Never Ending Poop&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Monty Pythons &quot;Quest for the Holy Poop&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And of course &quot;The Princess Poop&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hmm my nephew would love this  I guess more along his lines would be ..<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Stuart Poop&quot; and &quot;Poop Neutron&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(It&#39;s not as much fun with kids movies with their one word titles or titles <br/>
that are just the name of a charater.  :( )<br/>
