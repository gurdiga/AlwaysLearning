<div id="ygrps-yiv-372350518"><p><span>I&#39;ve strted the process of requestion that <span style="font-weight:bold;">groups.io </span>import the members and content of this group. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p>It won&#39;t happen quickly; there&#39;s a queue and a backlog.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The cost will be $220 a year (so... $18.33 a month). &nbsp;I did pay for the first year, but did NOT opt to pay the extra $200 for them to expedite us. &nbsp;Here&#39;s why that&#39;s okay:</p><p><br></p><p>A dad in this group has already secured the archives. &nbsp;(Thank you, Vlad!) So if that full-group transfer fails, the older posts will still be available. &nbsp;I&#39;ve seen the format. &nbsp;It&#39;s way nicer and easier to read than yahoogroups ever was. :-) &nbsp;So either we&#39;ll have the archive there, or on my website, or maybe both. &nbsp;But there will be a group home for us, nicer than this one, with or without a direct archive.</p><p><br></p><p>I suppose if the group dies out, because of the move, I won&#39;t need to renew the group next year. &nbsp;If it thrives, I think it won&#39;t be too hard to raise (or appeal for donation of) $220 from group members. &nbsp;I have some stuff I could sell. :-)</p><p><br></p><p>So please hang out here and wait for an invitation to the new group. &nbsp;It should go to the address you&#39;re using here. &nbsp;Once the transfer is finished, I think you&#39;ll be able to use any old e-mail you want, over there.</p><p><br></p><p>Thanks!</p><p><br></p></div>
