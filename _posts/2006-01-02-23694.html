<div id="ygrps-yiv-1985381496">&quot;IMPOSING a &quot;less is more&quot; principle on a child just sounds<br/>
puritanical, though, to me. What if a child thinks having a big party<br/>
and getting lots of gifts sounds really fun?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Trevor had BIG Birthday parties when he was little. He was an only <br/>
child for almost four years, and our first, so we had FUN.<br/>
Hired a clown once, always made nice birthday cakes, tons of friends <br/>
and gifts etc...<br/>
<br/>
 His choice of &quot;parties&quot; in the last few years have either involved <br/>
very small get togethers or just one friend and a day spent <br/>
shopping/goofing off and eating lunch out.<br/>
<br/>
He turned 16 today. My New Year&#39;s baby is just two years from being <br/>
a legal adult. We spent last night celebrating....with one other <br/>
family, some homemade pizza and a cake. He played video games, which <br/>
he does every day and had a very nice birthday....exactly how he <br/>
wanted it.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, he would have liked to play paintball, but it&#39;s a bit <br/>
chilly and nobody wanted to play with him (they don&#39;t like the pain <br/>
part)....so we&#39;re waiting until spring. :)<br/>
<br/>
Doing nice things for your kids doesn&#39;t turn them into some kind of <br/>
greedy monsters..really.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-98670044">&quot; When you<br/>
see how someone else does things, I think it is fine to observe how <br/>
you feel about it. It gives you an opportunity to learn something <br/>
about yourself. How, why would you do things? If differently? The <br/>
problem is stopping with the observation before it turns into a <br/>
judgment. Does that make sense. My perspective may be different but <br/>
not better.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well, sometimes it is!!:)  If a parent is being mean to a child, I <br/>
DO judge that as &quot;not better&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
But a lot of our &quot;stuff&quot; is tied to childhood and it makes for some <br/>
interesting examinations. If you allow yourself to feel the initial <br/>
feeling, then stay with that feeling and examine it (rather than try <br/>
to stop it) you CAN learn some really amazing things about yourself.<br/>
<br/>
I often find that messes create some yucky feeling bubbling up in <br/>
me...but if I stay with the feeling and examine it (as Jon Kabbat-<br/>
Zin explains so beautifully in &quot;wherever you go, there you are&quot;) I <br/>
often find there is some underlying reason that has nothing to do <br/>
with the actual mess.  Our emotions are often tied to issues buried <br/>
a bit deeper than the surface reaction...it IS good to examine that <br/>
and see where it leads.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I totally agree with Ren.<br/>
<br/>
For years we&#39;ve had a recurring discussion about whether judgment is  <br/>
a good or a bad thing.<br/>
It has to be a good thing or else there&#39;s no way to distinguish  <br/>
between things, no direction to face when trying to &quot;do better.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Part of what I think it is is the Christian platitude &quot;judge not,  <br/>
lest ye be judged.&quot;  But for the kind of Christians I grew up with,  <br/>
&#39;judgment&#39; had to do with absolutes, with &quot;saved&quot; or &quot;damned.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My judgment that someone else might ought to try to be a better mom,  <br/>
or a more honest person, or more responsible, doesn&#39;t condemn them in  <br/>
any real way.  They get bad marks in my own universe; I&#39;m less likely  <br/>
to ask them to babysit.  But that doesn&#39;t mean others share my judgment.<br/>
<br/>
Denying that we&#39;re judging things isn&#39;t healthy.  It&#39;s useful in the  <br/>
context of being sheep to be led.  Don&#39;t YOU judge, let the leaders  <br/>
judge and then tell you what to think, whether someone is still good  <br/>
enough to come to church or whether he should be run off.  At our  <br/>
church we were told to leave judgment to God, but I&#39;ve seen people  <br/>
discouraged, and run off, and defended, and covered for, and  <br/>
condemned church-wise.<br/>
<br/>
But when a parent is reviewing his or her own childhood memories and  <br/>
current relationships and the messages she might be still reciting  <br/>
(with the tone and accent of a grandparent, sometimes) , that DOES  <br/>
require a judgment.  Is that internal message good to keep or should  <br/>
that recorded loop be quieted down?<br/>
