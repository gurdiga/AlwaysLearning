on the West coast - way south... So. California.  I know nothing about tofu<br/>
or the other items you&#39;ve been exchanging info about of late, so have no<br/>
input there, though I&#39;ve learned quite a bit.  :)<br/>
<br/>
To reintroduce... I have a 12 year old daughter and 6 year old son... I&#39;ve<br/>
discovered (we&#39;re pretty new to this) that my daughter learns more and more<br/>
as I let her do her own thing and explore her interests... I won&#39;t drone on<br/>
about all of it specifically, but she&#39;s amazing.  My son runs from anything<br/>
that remotely resembles &quot;schoolwork&quot; ... I don&#39;t sit him down with<br/>
worksheets or any of that rote busy work... mostly we read, and build<br/>
things - legos, lincoln logs, robots (this was cool).  I have to admit that<br/>
I&#39;m worried about his reading, or rather his not reading.  He&#39;ll be 7 in<br/>
May.  I have no concerns in any other area....  he&#39;s into how things are<br/>
&quot;built&quot; until you get to the letters... he even likes sentences (for<br/>
example - he likes you to give him a sentence verbally, then he names off<br/>
which is the verb, adjective, nouns, etc.... I guess because the sentences<br/>
are built out of these and there&#39;s some logical structure - just like the<br/>
lincoln logs... but the letters... forget it.)  Ok I know I need to chill<br/>
and stop worrying... but I can&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts?  I appreciate it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Alyce.<br/>
<br/>
I just have a couple of thoughts based on your post.  Here&#39;s the biggest <br/>
one:  Please Don&#39;t Worry.  When (not if) he starts reading, it&#39;ll be <br/>
because he has found a really good reason to do it, and that reason <br/>
probably won&#39;t be pleasing anyone else (like his mom).  Reading is one of <br/>
the great tools to have (like walking and talking), and he&#39;ll get it.  Six <br/>
years old is really young!  So is seven.  So is eight.  Since you say he <br/>
runs from anything that looks like school work, just follow his lead.  And <br/>
please don&#39;t worry and don&#39;t watch the calendar.  He&#39;ll emerge as a whole <br/>
person if you allow him to, but he&#39;ll may pick up on your worrying, and <br/>
that can affect him, too.  Just be with him.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to tell when reading an email, but I also get the sense that you <br/>
may be comparing your son to your daughter (but I could be TOTALLY wrong <br/>
about that).   That can change things, too, but I probably don&#39;t have to <br/>
tell you that.  It&#39;s just something to watch for.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, there&#39;s no shortage of stories out there about kids starting to <br/>
read at a much older age than is acceptable in our society (where 2- and <br/>
3-year-olds are encouraged to start reading!).  Here&#39;s a link to an essay <br/>
by Carol Rice that completely eased my mind (I have an 8-year-old son who <br/>
doesn&#39;t read at all; he&#39;s magical).<br/>
<br/>

I hope this helps just a little.<br/>

At 15, he reads fine now, though he doesn&#39;t much.  He&#39;s a doer, like your<br/>
boy.  He can think up mountain bike stunt equipment in his head and then<br/>
just build it.  He can do all kinds of things that he could eventually make<br/>
a living doing, but he isn&#39;t likely to ever learn things from books.  It&#39;s<br/>
