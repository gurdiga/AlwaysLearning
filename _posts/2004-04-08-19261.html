<div id="ygrps-yiv-1419442447">&quot;The dumber kids are in school the more interesting school will seem.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That was my first thought.<br/>
I looked over at Jalen watching &quot;Dora the Explorer&quot;, how he&#39;s <br/>
laughing and wiggling and singing along with them and how very dull <br/>
school would seem in comparison.  Schools don&#39;t really want bright <br/>
kids, they want compliant kids.<br/>
Jalen would be one of the first kids to be recommended for drugs if <br/>
he was school bound...I&#39;m quite sure of that. He&#39;s too bright and <br/>
happy for that institution of dumbing down, and they&#39;d notice it <br/>
right away.<br/>
Happy, bright, intensely curious kids learn a lot from <br/>
television...but that&#39;s exactly why they&#39;d be at risk for &quot;ADHD&quot;, <br/>
which some of the brightest people on the planet have been labeled <br/>
with.<br/>
Edison was considered &quot;addled&quot; and his third grade teacher said he&#39;d <br/>
never amount to anything but a failure. That was the last year he <br/>
spent in school I believe. I bet he&#39;d have loved television.<br/>
