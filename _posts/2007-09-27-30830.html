<div id="ygrps-yiv-784890080">I think it&#39;s a fairly insipid article that doesn&#39;t say much.<br/>
<br/>
-=-The energy homeschooled teens exude could jump-start a doorknob.  <br/>
When it is channeled in a positive direction it becomes a chain  <br/>
reaction of benevolence in the form of good deeds, good work, and  <br/>
good will. When it is misguided or neglected it swallows their  <br/>
opportunities for growth and detours them from their natural course  <br/>
of development to adulthood. The same is true for all teens.-=-<br/>
<br/>
This doesn&#39;t make much sense to me.  &quot;Jump-start a doorknob&quot;?  and  <br/>
&quot;the same&quot; what is true of all teens?  It doesn&#39;t follow.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-My hope for all of you homeschooling teens is that once your  <br/>
children safely transition into healthy and well-adjusted young  <br/>
adults, you will look back on this stage of their development with  <br/>
some amusement, and also with deep appreciation that through  <br/>
homeschooling you became your teens&#39; allies in the process of growing  <br/>
up.-=-<br/>
<br/>
The final paragraph turns to mush because &quot;all of you homeschooling  <br/>
teens&quot; seems to address teens who are homeschooled, but by the time I  <br/>
was in the middle of the paragraph I knew she had meant to address it  <br/>
to &quot;all of you who are homeschooling teens&quot;--homeschooling is the  <br/>
verb and teens is the object.  I read it as homeschooling the  <br/>
adjective, teens the noun.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t look at this stage of my kids development with amusement.   <br/>
It&#39;s as deep and full and real as any other phase of our lives together.<br/>
<br/>
-=-through homeschooling you became your teens&#39; allies in the process  <br/>
of growing up.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Through La Leche League and a nursing relationship I became my  <br/>
babies&#39; allies, and it didn&#39;t happen when they were teens.  It was a  <br/>
lifelong relationship with them by the time they were teens.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-115887094">Kind of - hmmm - hard to respond to because there isn&#39;t much  <br/>
substance. This part jumped out at me, though:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;The changing bodies brought new and different energy, attitudes,  <br/>
thought, and behavior -- and along with it, parental anxiety. This  <br/>
was a surprise to me and many of my homeschool friends who believed  <br/>
the ultimate urban legend - that homeschooled teens are immune to the  <br/>
pressures, social expectations, and behavior dictated by pop culture  <br/>
in America.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As if pop culture in America is a disease that teens are especially  <br/>
susceptible to?  I&#39;ve known lots of people who are living a life  <br/>
filled with trying to resist pop culture. That isn&#39;t what we&#39;re doing  <br/>
- we&#39;re embracing whatever we find adds to the joy in our lives - not  <br/>
labeling it as &quot;pop culture&quot; and so to be resisted. That&#39;s a big  <br/>
difference. We can revel in new styles, new music, even clever  <br/>
advertisements, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
Also occurred to me that the poor kids might feel guilty that they&#39;ve  <br/>
let their parents down by being interested in &quot;pop culture.&quot;<br/>

That&#39;s it.  That&#39;s what was bugging me about this one.  What I see <br/>
between the lines here are power struggles  *because* the teens are <br/>
into pop culture and the parents are worried about it, if not <br/>
completely negative about it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That is what I felt reading it too.  A lot of parents look down on <br/>
pop culture, homeschooled or not, as if in some way they could <br/>
control it or their child&#39;s access to it.<br/>
<br/>
My personal experience is that, even if a child is highly sheltered, <br/>
there is no way to not be exposed to it.<br/>
<br/>
We have some friends that try to shelter their kids from all of <br/>
that.  They are exposed to it through us.  My younger daughter is <br/>
friends with them, they are really nice kids.  However, my younger <br/>
daughter lives with a teenager.  She knows teen language and teen <br/>
ideas and brings them into her play.  She can&#39;t help but be exposed <br/>
to pop culture.<br/>
<br/>
When my oldest daughter was little, she lived a little less in pop <br/>
culture, not because we were sheltering her, but because her life was <br/>
different primarily as the only child hanging out with her parents <br/>
and doing what her parents did, which didn&#39;t always include pop <br/>
culture.<br/>
<br/>
Kids come across pop culture over and over in places that parents <br/>
can&#39;t control.  What always strikes me about that, is if you live in <br/>
a culture that is immersed in pop culture, how can you truly control <br/>
it or avoid it.  Even the Amish aren&#39;t so isolated that they aren&#39;t <br/>
exposed to it here and there.  You really can&#39;t isolate yourself from <br/>
your own culture, so why not embrace it and experience the truth of <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
The article was a lot of nothing.  As if we can control how our kids <br/>
turn out, or even worse uphold a really bad stereotype of <br/>
homeschooling that all kids are genuises if they are homeschooled.  <br/>
It seems to be a prevelant way of thinking and I guess homeschoolers <br/>
aren&#39;t immune from it.</div>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; exposed to it here and there.  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t the Amish have a tradition where a young adult leaves the community <br/>
for a year and lives as a &quot;regular&quot; person with a Western lifestyle & <br/>
technology before returning - if they choose to - to the Amish life? I <br/>
understood that the purpose of this sabbatical was to allow their folk to <br/>
embrace the self-chosen limits without reservation.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt; You really can&#39;t isolate yourself from<br/>
your own culture, so why not embrace it and experience the truth of  it. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would want to embrace it even if I COULD isolate myself from it. <br/>
Unschooling is partly about making our children&#39;s world bigger, not smaller.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Some how this reminded me of a conversation I had when I was 16 years old.  I was talking to a mother of a 13 year old.  He had an unusual hair style and I asked her  &quot;why would you let him fix his hair like that?&quot;  I asked it totally thinking she would see things my way.  She said &quot;it&#39;s not my head&quot;  That remark has stuck with me and I think about it a lot.  It isn&#39;t her head, her hair or her decision.  I grew up thinking that parents had to tell their kids what to do and enforce it and I was shocked that she wasn&#39;t doing her job as a parent.  Now that I am a parent, I completely agree with her answer.  Small things can really make a big difference in the way we live our lives and treat others.  Now I stop myself before &quot;telling&quot; my kids to do something and I ask myself &quot;would I want my husband to say it to me?&quot;<br/>
