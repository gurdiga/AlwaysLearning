<div id="ygrps-yiv-1792410132">I don&#39;t like much discussion of conferences on this list, but I&#39;m going to summarize a few things.  Hearing about unschooling in the presence of other people who are also interested has a value that can&#39;t be reproduced in writing.<br/>
<br/>
June 30 I&#39;m speaking for a full day in Leiden, the Netherlands.<br/>

<br/>
July 15, I&#39;m speaking for a full day in Ashford, Surrey, UK<br/>

<br/>
August 3-5 I&#39;ll speak each day at least once at the HSC conference in Sacramento (Pam Sorooshian, too, and maybe others who are on this list)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The conference rates go up after July 4th - so if you&#39;re thinking of<br/>
coming, save some money by registering very soon.<br/>
<br/>
If you want a really really nice family vacation - this conference is super<br/>
fun for the whole family - lots and lots of activities and things to do for<br/>
young children to teens.<br/>
