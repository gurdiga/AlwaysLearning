<div id="ygrps-yiv-215040519">just happened upon this site and at quick perusal came upon a pro unschooling article and a pro-breastfeeding article - haven&#39;t read deeper, but thought i&#39;d pass the site on - wonder if anyone&#39;s heard of it?<br/>

Even if it had been a fantastic unschooling site, please post  <br/>
something personal or particular to this list with each post you  <br/>
make.  People can find great sites with google.  I&#39;m trying to  <br/>
preserve this list for things that can pretty much only be found on  <br/>
this list.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
