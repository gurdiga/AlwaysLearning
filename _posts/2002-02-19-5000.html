&gt;&quot;Child led&quot; isn&#39;t one of my criteria.  Lots of people like to say that, but I <br/>
&gt;think it&#39;s too one-sided.  The questions above are too technical, too <br/>
&gt;&quot;measured,&quot; too clinical.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been meaning to say this for a while now, and have never gotten <br/>
around to it. (or maybe I have and just don&#39;t remember).  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I agree that &#39;child-led&#39; is too one-sided, etc.  I think <br/>
unschooling is more like being in *relationship* with your children, and <br/>
being *engaged* with them as much as possible.<br/>
<br/>
If you think in terms of a marriage and before you were married or had <br/>
kids, and the two of you were together and being with each other as much <br/>
as possible...naturally ideas and commitments and strategies for living <br/>
and dreams of the future just grow out of the time you spend together, <br/>
and your love for one another and your youthful enthusiasm.  So that <br/>
when you have a baby, you begin that again with a new person, perhaps <br/>
the 3 of you together doing that kind of dreaming and planning and <br/>
doing.  And you move in and out of each others space as the child grows <br/>
and the interactions change and evolve and you separate and come <br/>
together, just like when one partner goes off to work or goes fishing or <br/>
something.  And there&#39;s really no subdividing of your relationship or <br/>
life, that it all flows together, organically, like a living organism.<br/>
<br/>
This is all rather stream-of-concsiousness, so forgive me if it&#39;s hard <br/>
to follow.<br/>
