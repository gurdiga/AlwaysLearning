<div id="ygrps-yiv-1207089750">I miss my Basenji. Ex would have nothing to do with her, so I ended up with<br/>
her. No, I won&#39;t have another one, but I sure miss her. She was with me for<br/>
13 years, hated men, children, other dogs, and all cats except mine<br/>
(thankfully) and I had to keep her separated from my son until her last two<br/>
years, when she turned into the sweetest dog, albeit blind and with cancer.<br/>
That earned her a round of chemotherapy and one last good summer. There&#39;s<br/>
not much explaining it, and I don&#39;t recommend them to people, but I melt<br/>
when I see one.<br/>
<br/>
And no, my ex&#39;s name isn&#39;t Wally :) !<br/>

who is just recently owned by a miniature wirehaired Dachshund<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Wally&#39;s first wife was a Basenji owner. Let&#39;s not go there. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I can really see how things end up this way for Basenji owners.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
It&#39;s not something a reasonable person would ever do TWICE, on purpose.<br/>
I do like the singing though.  Just not at four in the morning.  Last<br/>
night I came home to find her curled up an sleeping peacefully... on the<br/>
REFRIGERATOR!   My husband wants a Golden Retriever.  He&#39;s such a<br/>
sensible guy.<br/>

considered an act of terrorism. &lt;&lt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I know what you mean.  There&#39;s just something about them.  My vet said it<br/>
was a good thing I had my dog because there wasn&#39;t another person alive<br/>
who&#39;d live with her!  That&#39;s probably true, but when I look at that face,<br/>
well, melt is a good word for it.<br/>
I&#39;m sorry you lost yours.<br/>
