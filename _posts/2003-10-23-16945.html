<div id="ygrps-yiv-1142147673">I got this from the NIH. If anyone is in the Atlanta area, it might <br/>
interest you. I received their free curriculum supplement on the topic, <br/>
and it is quite good, as are all their supplements. And, they are FREE!<br/>

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) invites you to a FREE two-hour<br/>
workshop in Atlanta, Georgia:<br/>
<br/>
Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism: Its not just Health Anymore<br/>
<br/>
The workshop will be held Friday, November 7 from 1:00 pm to 3:00 pm in<br/>
the Birch Room of the Omni Hotel at the CNN Center. The hotel is next<br/>
to the convention center where the National Middle School Association<br/>
is meeting.<br/>
<br/>
Participants receive a FREE copy of &quot;Understanding Alcohol:<br/>
Investigations into Biology and Behavior,&quot; the latest NIH curriculum<br/>
supplement for grades 7-8.<br/>
<br/>
To attend the workshop, please respond to Jason Lazarow,<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jlazarow@...">jlazarow@...</a> or 301-435-8043.<br/>
<br/>
This workshop explores our misunderstandings about alcohol and how our<br/>
bodies metabolize alcohol. Virtual mouse experiments allow students to<br/>
test genetic and environmental factors that determine the respond to<br/>
alcohol. Hands-on activities examine alcohol consumption in humans and<br/>
how individual reactions vary. Finally, a computer-based simulation<br/>
shows how alcohol impairs the ability to drive. These lessons are<br/>
specifically designed for the middle school science classroom.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your interest in the NIH curriculum supplements. We look<br/>
forward to seeing you on November 7.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
Bruce Fuchs, Ph.D.<br/>
Director<br/>
NIH Office of Science Education<br/>
