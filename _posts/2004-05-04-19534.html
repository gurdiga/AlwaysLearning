Written By: Omri Fiman/Marty Murphy<br/>
<br/>
Hello. Allow me to introduce myself to you. My name is autism. Perhaps you <br/>
know me or know of me. I am a condition, a &quot;disorder&quot; that affects many people. <br/>
I strike at will, when and where I want. Unlike Downs Syndrome or other birth <br/>
&quot;defects&quot;, I leave no marks on those I strike. In fact, I pride myself on the <br/>
ability to infiltrate a child&#39;s life, while leaving him or her strikingly <br/>
handsome. Many people may not even know I am there. They blame the child for what <br/>
I cause him or her to do. I am autism and I do as I please.<br/>
  I am autism. I strike boys and girls. infants and toddlers. I find my best <br/>
victims to be boys around the age of 2, but any child will do. I like children <br/>
and they are always the true victims, though I take hostage the others in the <br/>
child&#39;s family as well. It<br/>
is a bit like getting 2 for the price of one. I affect one child and &quot;infect&quot; <br/>
the entire family.<br/>
  I am autism. I strike rich and poor alike. The rich combat me with <br/>
education and therapy. The poor shut their children away and cannot afford to fight <br/>
me. I am able to win in the lives of poor children more than I am those of the <br/>
wealthy, but I will try to take root anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
  I am autism. I am an equal opportunity disorder. I strike whites, blacks, <br/>
Mexicans, Ukrainians, Russians,Poles, Slavs, Japanese, Koreans and Fins. In <br/>
fact, I strike everywhere on Earth. I know no geographical<br/>
bounds.<br/>
<br/>
  I am autism. I do not discriminate based upon religion<br/>
either. I strike Jews and Christians, Muslims and Buddhists, Atheists and <br/>
Agnostics. I do not care what religion a person is or what beliefs he may hold. <br/>
When<br/>
I strike, there will be little time for any of that anyway. When they find <br/>
me, they will question<br/>
everything they believe in, so why would I strike only one group? I have <br/>
affected followers of every religion on the planet.<br/>
<br/>
I am autism and I am strong and getting stronger every year, every month, <br/>
every day, every minute and every second. I am concerned that money might be <br/>
allotted to combat me and my takeover of children, but so far, I have little to <br/>
fear. Some countries like Kuwait, are<br/>
spending quite a bit of money to assist those who I have targeted and some, <br/>
like the United States, would rather spend money on such ludicrous things as <br/>
discovering the number of American Indians who<br/>
practice Voodoo, as opposed to combating me. In an atmosphere such as that, I <br/>
can flourish and wreck havoc at will. In places such as that, I rub my hands<br/>
with glee at the problems I can cause to children, their families and to the <br/>
society at large.<br/>
<br/>
I am autism. When I come, I come to stay. I take the dreams and hopes of <br/>
families and trample them with delight. I see the fear and confusion in the eyes <br/>
of my victims and the see the formation of wrinkles, the worries and pain on <br/>
the face of their parents. I see the embarrassment their child causes because of <br/>
me and the parents unsuccessful attempt to hide their child, and me. I see <br/>
tears the parents cry and feel the tears of their child. I am autism. I leave <br/>
sorrow in my wake.<br/>
<br/>
I am autism. I taketh away and give nothing but bewilderment and loathing in <br/>
return. I take speech and learning. I take socialization and understanding. I <br/>
take away &quot;common sense&quot; and, if I am allowed to flourish, I take away all but <br/>
their physical life.<br/>
What I leave behind, is almost worse than death.<br/>
I am autism. I fear nothing except courage, which I thankfully see little of. <br/>
I fear those who take a stand against me and attempt to fight me and bring <br/>
others into the fight as well. I fear those who try to make it safe and easier <br/>
for my victims in the community, and their families. I fear those who push <br/>
ahead, despite the fact that I am in tow. I fear the day I will be eradicated from <br/>
the planet. Yet, I do not fear too much right now. There is no need.<br/>
<br/>
I am autism and I bet you know me or know of me. If you don&#39;t, you probably <br/>
will soon. I am marching forward faster than I ever have before. I am looking <br/>
for new children all the time. I am looking for new children to consume and new <br/>
lives to destroy. I dread the day I will be looked upon with pity or worse <br/>
yet, understanding, for that day, is the day I will begin to die.<br/>
<br/>
But in the mean time I am safe, free to prowl onward. Free to cause the pain <br/>
and suffering that I do so well. I am on a mission and have much work to do <br/>
and thankfully no one is stopping me yet.<br/>
<br/>
Hello. Allow me to introduce myself. My name is autism. Perhaps you know me <br/>
of know of me, if not<br/>
don&#39;t worry, you will meet me soon....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The best thing you can spend on your children is time. <br/>
