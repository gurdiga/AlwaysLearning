<div id="ygrps-yiv-145255830">Hello. I have recently rejoined this list after a long absence (and I was<br/>
just a lurker before, so I doubt anyone would remember me--although Sandra,<br/>
yours was the voice that first got me started thinking about homeschooling<br/>
and unschooling way back on AOL in the mid 90s, when my oldest was just an<br/>
infant...I used to go to chats you hosted there). I have five children ages<br/>
12 to 1, always homeschooled, and though we started off as unschoolers I<br/>
drifted into requiring this and that over the years--very gentle & Charlotte<br/>
Masonish, but still some requiring.<br/>
<br/>
And we have mostly been happy but often been tense, and in the past few<br/>
months I&#39;ve been looking around and noticing that there really is a lot more<br/>
tension here in my home than I had realized. I realized I am being more<br/>
critical, a scolder, and this is so far from the picture I have always had<br/>
of myself that it has been something of a shock.<br/>
<br/>
So I resubbed here and have spent a couple of days buried in the archives<br/>
and reimmersing myself in all the helpful stuff at Sandra and Joyce&#39;s sites.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s rather a humbling experience to take a good look at yourself and see<br/>
that you&#39;ve lost hold of something you once held very firmly in your heart.<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m a huge believer in fresh starts, and I decided to just hit my<br/>
personal reset button and start fresh. I am still pondering some of the<br/>
basic issues about chores, meals, etc, that I know many of you have settled<br/>
for yourselves a long time ago. For now I have begun with something very<br/>
simple, which is saying yes instead of no. I was reading Sandra&#39;s Yes page<br/>
and I could hear myself saying no no no all the time. I used to always be a<br/>
yes mom. Somewhere between kids 3 and 4 I drifted into no...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m seeing myself use words like &quot;drift&quot; and &quot;shift&quot; a lot, and it&#39;s strange<br/>
that it feels so gradual and invisible a change in me, because that implies<br/>
the opposite of mindfulness, and honestly it&#39;s not like I ever stopped<br/>
thinking about parenting and education issues. Perhaps I&#39;ve thought about<br/>
them TOO much, read too many opposing points of view, got all muddled up in<br/>
my own mind. What do I really think? I hardly know anymore. (I told you it<br/>
was humbling. I&#39;m pushing 40 and I feel way dumber than I did at 25.)<br/>
<br/>
Things are not terrible here, just, as I said, sometimes full of friction.<br/>
Cross words coming out of my mouth (the 25 yr old me would be shocked).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, as I said, yesterday I took a deep breath and started over, with<br/>
YES. I kept a little list of all the things the kids asked for (they didn&#39;t<br/>
see me doing this).<br/>
<br/>
Can we have some jellybeans? Yes.<br/>
Can we watch a movie? Yes<br/>
Could you get me a pickle and a napkin in a bowl, and can I eat it on the<br/>
couch? Yes. (Shushing the mom-voice in my head that wanted to say we NEVER<br/>
eat on the couch, you know that. I just said &#39;sure&#39; and got the pickle, and<br/>
then another when she asked for a second one.)<br/>
Can we play a computer game? Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Later I was looking at my list and I thought, wow, I&#39;d have loved to have a<br/>
day like that when I was a kid. Jellybeans and a movie and pickles and<br/>
computer games.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t actually have any of the &quot;but what if all they ever want to do is<br/>
eat jellybeans and play computer games&quot; concerns because I see how creative<br/>
my kids are and how whenever they&#39;ve had time on the computer or watching a<br/>
video they run off and play elaborate pretend games based on whatever they<br/>
were watching/playing, and they ask me to read to them a lot, and THEY read<br/>
a lot, and I am constantly astonished by how much they know and how most of<br/>
it is a surprise to me, not stuff I&#39;ve directed. So, since I am NOT worried<br/>
about that, I had to ask myself what I AM worried about--why would I have<br/>
said no to those same requests the day before?<br/>
<br/>
I am thinking about all this, why I became a No mom, and getting back in the<br/>
habit of saying yes.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I wanted to thank you for your illuminating discussions here.<br/>
<br/>
Sara, mom of five<br/>

<br/>
It didn&#39;t hurt me; I&#39;m used to it.  Thanks for the public apology,  <br/>
though!<br/>
People come here emotional and defensive.  It happens regularly.<br/>
We could endorse their mood and say &quot;There there,&quot; or we can  <br/>
immediately start giving them tools to change their lives.  Because  <br/>
it&#39;s volunteer time, most posters don&#39;t want to waste any.  We make  <br/>
no profit by stretching it out for days or weeks.  Our &quot;profit&quot; is in  <br/>
getting other families&#39; kids into better situations soon, quickly,  <br/>
and helping those families start unschooling better right away, that  <br/>
moment, instead of maybe eventually someday.  &quot;Maybe eventually  <br/>
someday&quot; can easily mean never.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I just took it the wrong way. Next time I will<br/>

<br/>
I have a better idea, than thinking &quot;next time&quot; or asking.<br/>
Every time you have a strong defensive reaction to anyone&#39;s input,  <br/>
anywhere, think why that is.<br/>
Do a self-check about what emotions you&#39;re feeling and why, and  <br/>
whether there might be some truth in the feedback you&#39;re getting,  <br/>
whether it&#39;s paid for or free or thrust on you but a passing stranger.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t assume people are trying to hurt you.<br/>
<br/>
If you can make those changes, it will be better for your family,  <br/>
your kids, and for you.<br/>
<br/>
