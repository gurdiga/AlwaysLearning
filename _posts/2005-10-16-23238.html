<div id="ygrps-yiv-210475321">Is there anyone here perhaps from Hamilton, New Zealand?<br/>
<br/>
I just found this:<br/>
<br/>
-=-On November 25, 2004, a life-size bronze statue of Richard O&#39;Brien in his <br/>
Riff Raff space suit was unveiled in Hamilton, New Zealand, where O&#39;Brien grew <br/>
up after moving from England. Commissioned jointly by a local theatre group <br/>
and the Hamilton City Council, the statue stands on the site of the old Embassy <br/>
Cinema, where O&#39;Brien once watched science-fiction double features.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I would love to have a photo of this, and if it&#39;s on a postcard that would be <br/>
VERY cool.<br/>
<br/>
With google I saw a photo of the plaque at the base of it (also cool) and <br/>
read that it was made by WETA, who did the props and lots of special effects for <br/>
the Lord of the Rings movies.<br/>

35 minutes away<br/>

the unveiling of the statue I&#39;d send you that as well! But unfortunately <br/>
that was a sight not shown to me either.<br/>
<br/>
One of the local theatre companies is currently doing  The Rocky Horror <br/>
Show, working with O&#39;Brien. Unfortunately, I have spent my &#39;show money&#39; <br/>
on tickets for my 15yo and I to go see John Cleese.<br/>

Jackson.<br/>
<br/>
Send me your address off line, Sandra, and I&#39;ll send you a pic of Riff <br/>
Raff, and a bit about the local production from the paper.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and re the Embassy theatre: one of my earliest memories is sitting <br/>
in the front row of the Embassy (which was actually a theatre where <br/>
movies were shown) right next to the drums, for a production of the <br/>
Mikado. I will be going to that next year, when the local operatic <br/>
society will be doing that again.<br/>

was fun.<br/>
<br/>
So maybe  now I think you meant mailed them.  Wherever they are,  <br/>
though, thanks. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if South Park, Colorado will do a bronze statue of Matt  <br/>
Stone and Trey Parker?  (Or maybe of Cartman, Kyle and Stan...)<br/>
Albuquerque&#39;s Highland High School should do something for Mike  <br/>
Judge.  (Maybe he&#39;s in a trophy case or something.)<br/>
