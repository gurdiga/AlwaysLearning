<div id="ygrps-yiv-1867199890">Hi, I&#39;m a lurker up here in beautiful Victoria BC Canada and couldn&#39;t <br/>
help but add my favourite Viggo movie:<br/>
GI Jane. He plays a tough with a sensitive side (reads D.H. Lawrence <br/>
poetry on screen) Master Command Chief of a Navy Seal type training camp <br/>
and Demi Moore plays the first woman to go through the very tough <br/>
training, complete of course with sexism etc. It&#39;s a great movie without <br/>
**too** much violence and has Crissy Hines singing in it for the added <br/>
chick flick flavour. Enjoy! P.S. This is a great list, I enjoy reading <br/>
your emails. Brightest blessings, Jane.</div>

and Demi Moore plays the first woman to go through  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never seen that movie, though I think it might be based on the life of <br/>
the granddaughter of my neighbor Mrs. Carter, who also had a letter (I got to <br/>
hold it &lt;g&gt;) from Mother Teresa.   She was a very cool neighbor, and her <br/>
granddaughter was either the first female to graduate the naval academy or the first <br/>
seal or something.<br/>
<br/>
Another Viggo Mortensen part is in one of my very favorite movies, Crimson <br/>
Tide.  He&#39;s in the first scene, and he&#39;s throughout but his character is very <br/>
quiet and hardly movies.  His big actions are ironing a shirt and smoking a <br/>
cigarette.  You  might have seen the movie and not recogized him because he&#39;s <br/>
relatively hairless.  He plays &quot;Ops&quot; who is being told &quot;push the button&quot; and <br/>
&quot;don&#39;t push the button&quot; in the crucial scene.<br/>
<br/>
When we first saw that movie it inspired me to watch a bunch of submarine <br/>
movies.  They&#39;re especially interesting, and while they have a kind of tension <br/>
and reality in common they made a good set viewings.  Submarine-movie unit.  <br/>
Some were shared with others in my family but I was the only one who watched all <br/>
of them.  <br/>
<br/>
Crimson Tide.  Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman, with half a dozen <br/>
excellent supporting actors.<br/>
