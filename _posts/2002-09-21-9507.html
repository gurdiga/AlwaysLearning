<div id="ygrps-yiv-312991042">Left on instant message on my computer, between two unschooled teens, on a <br/>
Friday night.<br/>
I wish I had saved the original, but I committed it totally to memory:<br/>
<br/>
Marty: You coming down?<br/>
other kid:  yeah.<br/>
Marty:  Did you know Canada has Prime Ministers?<br/>
other kid: yeah<br/>
Marty: dude<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And Marty has left, with two teenaged girls and another boy, to meet another <br/>
two boys and a girl, no couples, in a city park a few blocks away, where they <br/>
will frolic in the dark and run and laugh and then come back here a while.  <br/>
They told me which two cell phones will be left on in case I want to call.<br/>
