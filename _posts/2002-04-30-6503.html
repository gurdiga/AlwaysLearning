&lt;&lt; Personally, I feel freer here than at the other list. I ask more questions <br/>
 here and answer more questions there. You all feel more like friends and I <br/>
 have definitely NOT gotten to that place over there yet. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I totally agree.<br/>
I liken this list to hanging out with my unschooling friends at the park.<br/>
I can let my guard down, just hang loooooooose. YK?<br/>
Everyone here already &quot;gets it&quot; and being on the same page in the book is <br/>
really, really nice.  Both lists have their purpose of course.<br/>
The unschooling.com list has gotten a lot more productive and helpful lately, <br/>
for the aforementioned reasons.<br/>
