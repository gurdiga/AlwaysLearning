<div id="ygrps-yiv-871539194">My daughter who is 13, is Bipolar and has been special ed in school.  I am removing her from school formerly today and home (un) schooling her with my other two.<br/>
<br/>
The psychologist from school just called to ask if Lauren was coming in and I told her that with much thought I was removing Lauren and homeschooling her.  She asked about the kids curriculum and voiced her concerns about a visit she made here last week when she saw the kids eating breakfast at 10am and the 2 younger ones watching TV.  As if I needed explaining to this group, we are only 2-4 weeks into unschooling.   She then continued to voice her concerns and asked when I was schooling them and at what time we were sitting down with books.  She also expressed her concern at my working part time and doing this.  I told her that I was working one day a week and she then was worried that i wouldn&#39;t be able to afford this. I assured her that the house was stocked with food and I would never let my family go hungry.  She happens to be a nice person who was educated as a school teacher before she was a psychologist.  (Tada).<br/>
<br/>
I suggested that she go online and research homeschooling to see the many types and avenues of homeschooling there are.<br/>
<br/>
My question is should I be concerned that she is bringing up all these concerns - i.e. will she do anything further with the school system?  Can she?  After reading the laws and guidelines, she can&#39;t.  And due to Lauren&#39;s illness, we have worked hand in hand with DCF (Dept of Children and Families) both voluntarily and involuntarily and they know us well.  So that won&#39;t bother me, but her questions did.  They sounded too much like my mother&#39;s and my father&#39;s and my aunt&#39;s (another schoolteacher) and my other aunt&#39;s (another special ed teacher) .  My fiancee reminds me that I need to learn how to not let them rattle me, but after 48 years of basically doing whatever I want, it still does.<br/>
<br/>
All comments welcome!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Carole   Happy happy unschooler of Lauren (13)  Jonah (10) and Julia (7)<br/>

She can try to intimidate you, though, and pressure you.<br/>
<br/>
Schools lose money when people bail out.<br/>
In her case she might be doubly or triply worried because it makes  <br/>
her and her associates look bad if a parent would rather do it  <br/>
herself than let those professionals handle it.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re endangering her livelihood, a little bit.<br/>
But it&#39;s not your responsibility to maintain her livelihood.  I&#39;m  <br/>
just pointing out what her motivation might be.<br/>

This is so true.  They have been working &quot;on&quot; and with my daughter for years.  Since she was 5.  That explains it.  They cannot win their trophy now.  Thank you so much!!  And I not only pulled my daughter out but all my kids within 4 weeks.<br/>
