<div id="ygrps-yiv-522632774">I gave up on polish a long time ago.  It seems to wear off in less than <br/>
24 hrs so its not worth the time.  Let me know how Holly makes out with <br/>
her nail-biting.  My 5 yr old dd bites hers down so low I swear they&#39;re <br/>
about to bleed.  I try hard to not say anything because I used to bite <br/>
mine and nothing my mom said would get me to stop.  I try to tell myself <br/>
that in the grand scope of things it doesn&#39;t matter.  I just hope she <br/>
not doing it because of stress.  Has Holly bit at hers for long?<br/>

&gt;&lt;&lt; Kelli, me...how many other naked-faced <br/>
&gt;women are out there?  It&#39;s just shocking!  HeidiC.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My husband never liked make-up, which probably is one reason he liked me.   <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have owned some and used some (eye stuff mostly) but it always felt like <br/>
&gt;there was gunk on me that needed to be taken off.  I couldn&#39;t justify the <br/>
&gt;time spent, either.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have had female friends whose own families hadn&#39;t seen them without makeup. <br/>
&gt; I can&#39;t imagine an unschooling family in which that could even BEGIN to work.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sunday Holly found a stash of nail polish she had misplaced and we were going <br/>
&gt;through admiring the colors.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Holly is trying to stop biting her nails.  She quit for a week.  Then bit, <br/>
&gt;but a whole week!  And she saw how much they grew in a week.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My nails grow fast and they&#39;re strong.  I can use them for pry bars and screw <br/>
&gt;drivers.  It really irritates my friends who buy nail-jobs.  Especially since <br/>
&gt;I frequently cut the left hand short to play guitar (and keep the right long <br/>
&gt;for fingerpicking, or screw-driving.   <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Lately I&#39;ve been playing fiddle with Holly.  Again, left hand gets cut short.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So I painted my nails glittery gold with a clear overcoat.   At night, it <br/>
&gt;woke me up once.  The smell or the rough texture or something.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But on Monday, an adult friend of Holly&#39;s was coming over, someone pretty <br/>
&gt;pink (figuratively speaking) and Holly thought it would be cool for me to <br/>
&gt;have nail polish, kind of in honor of her much more feminine friend who wears <br/>
&gt;make-up.  And, Holly says, she wears three layers of pink nail polish.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;AHA!  The friend probably dressed down just for us.  She had makeup, but just <br/>
&gt;a plain kind of sweatshirt, and I noticed (but Holly did not notice) she was <br/>
&gt;wearing NO fingernail polish. &lt;g&gt;  So we played card games and I myself had <br/>
&gt;gloriously long and gold-glittery fingernails.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just thought that image might amuse those who&#39;ve met me. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Always, I think.<br/>

She messes with nail polish too.  Peels it, scratches it.   <br/>
<br/>
I used to bite mine and at some point it seemed just wrong, distasteful, <br/>
uncomfortable.  Probably my teeth weren&#39;t as strong anymore, or I wasn&#39;t so <br/>
bored anymore.  I don&#39;t know why I quit.  I was 14 or so, when I quit, I <br/>

I&#39;ve always bitten my nails as well.  From the time I had teeth according to family legend.  I bite them to the point where they are unbitable.  They often bleed and get very tender.  I&#39;ve also found that reading is REALLY bad on my nails.  I tend to bite more when I&#39;m reading a book, I guess it&#39;s just something to do with my hands.  When I get engrossed into a big novel or something I will have ten bloody tender fingers before I&#39;m done.    Sometimes I have to take a break from the book so I don&#39;t start biting the flesh as well.<br/>
<br/>
There were many large efforts on the part of my parents to get me to stop all through my childhood.  I was convinced in adolescence that I would never get married because my hands were ugly.  Visions of being at the alter and having my husband-to-be going to put on the ring only to shriek in horror upon seeing my mutilated fingers and run screaming from the church.  Obviously that didn&#39;t happen.  <br/>
<br/>
By the time I was an adult and happily married everyone seemed to stop noticing my nail biting.  But recently in the last year my granmother was up visiting and I was biting my nails in front of her.  She gave me a dirty look and batted my hand away and told me to stop.  I was shocked as no one had done that in years.  I told her I was a grown adult and they were my nails and I would bite them if I wanted.  And walked away.  It was very freeing!  I noticed it went away briefly after I gave birth to each of my kids as well.  I figure it was the combination of being WAY too busy and my hands always smelling like baby poop and wipes!  <br/>
<br/>
There was a time in highschool when my best friend (who I was in LOVE with, but he was gay) was trying to get me to stop biting my nails.  I don&#39;t remember what he had promised but it was something great I guess and I did stop biting for a month.  It was then that I realized I couldn&#39;t stop biting because nails drive me nuts!!  I felt like I was wearing spiked gloves on my fingers.  I had no sensation on my fingertips (which I was VERY used to having) and I kept stabbing myself in the eye or the nose.  I was used to using my fingers in a certain way to do things and having nails would require relearning everything!  I don&#39;t know how people function with nails.  Without them I have WAY more sensation on my fingertips, I never have to clean things out from under them and I don&#39;t impale my kids when I&#39;m bathing them  .<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t wear makeup either.  The last time I wore makeup was my wedding and I only did it then because at the last minute someone looked at me and said I needed it.  So everyone else pitched in and made me up.  I can&#39;t wear nail polish because a) the fumes will kill me! and b) it makes my hands feel like they are being smothered.    DD4yo used to bite her nails.  She started at about two and bit them fro about a year.  I was very sad about it because I figured she was mimicking me.  Because of the harassment I received as a child I made a big point of making sure NO one shamed my dd about her nails (very difficult task in my family) and now she doesn&#39;t bite them anymore.  At least for now.  She does want them painted though so I have to send her over to my sisters for that as I am deathly allergic.<br/>
<br/>
But if I didn&#39;t wear a bra and wore a bike my boobs would get caught in the spokes so that seems a bit too dangerous .<br/>
