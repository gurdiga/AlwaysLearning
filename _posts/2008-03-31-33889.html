<div id="ygrps-yiv-1207064991">Has anyone heard the new public service announcement from the Dept.  <br/>
of Human Services?  They are going on about the rates of drinking in  <br/>
teenagers, and the risks to their developing brain, etc. and then  <br/>
they say, authoritatively, that parents need to impose MORE rules and  <br/>
consequences to stop this drinking epidemic.<br/>
<br/>
I felt SO upset about them playing into this fear-based parenting  <br/>
that seems so prevalent - MORE consequences is the root of the  <br/>
problem in my opinion, and MORE rules and consequences can only cause  <br/>
teenagers to sneak around, and/or feel shamed and un-loved, which I&#39;m  <br/>
sure leads to more drinking - gotta numb the pain of being  <br/>
misunderstood and disrespected I guess.<br/>
<br/>
What about MORE family time?  MORE connection?  MORE trust?   <br/>
Respecting and encouraging their passions and interests?  I am always  <br/>
amazed that in a typical high school setting when a teenager violates  <br/>
school rules or gets poor grades, they often take away the  <br/>
&quot;privilege&quot; of their beloved sports or arts activity (as an  <br/>
incentive?), and we wonder why teenage suicide is on the rise...<br/>
