Actually, the letter is already here for you - you&#39;re already having the sensory experience of it.  Just because she has to write it doesn&#39;t mean you have to read it.<br/>

&gt;want to alienate us BUT she has to write this<br/>
&gt;letter... I was getting upset about it, even though I<br/>
&gt;knew I shouldn&#39;t.  I don&#39;t even have the letter yet<br/>
&gt;LOL!  I just wanted to say THANKS<br/>
