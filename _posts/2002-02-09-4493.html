&lt;&lt; How about people who put up with abuse from a child&#39;s parent to be kind to <br/>
the child? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Holly has friends whose moms aren&#39;t my friends.  I have friends whose kids <br/>
aren&#39;t Holly&#39;s friends.  Luckily, sometimes there&#39;s a whole family our whole <br/>
family likes! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When the boys were little, many of our regular play-dates were with families <br/>
from La Leche League.  Holly&#39;s have been more from homeschooling.  She&#39;s <br/>
brave about being at other houses overnight, so I don&#39;t have to hang around <br/>
just for her to play.  <br/>
<br/>
It was more a problem with littler kids.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m usually okay if they&#39;re just not talking about how to make their kids <br/>
finish their math assignments.<br/>
