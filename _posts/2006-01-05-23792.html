<div id="ygrps-yiv-1094974582">Well, you&#39;re right. It shouldn&#39;t matter what the childrens ages are... I thought that also. Why should I ask for someone the same sex and age....(I don&#39;t feel singled out, I&#39;m just relating a personal experience) but my 6 year old son wanted a pen pal and he asked for a boy that was his age. I&#39;d love if my boys wouldn&#39;t say &quot;ewwwww, a girl&quot; especially when I &quot;thought&quot; I had done a good job of not creating/allowing/inducing an atmosphere where that would come out........But he didn&#39;t want to be writing with a girl even though I said &quot;hey, I&#39;m a girl and you like me!&quot;..........I&#39;m not as eloquent as i&#39;d like to be but I think I&#39;m relaying it close to where i&#39;m trying to.............my boys don&#39;t want to play with girls right now. When they were younger it wasn&#39;t an issue but the past year or so it has changed. Maybe in a year it&#39;ll change again. Maybe it won&#39;t. Maybe we&#39;ll get hit by an asteroid next month...........<br/>
If you meant something much deeper and I totally missed it, I apologize.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have alot more questions and am one of those globbing people about the rules vs principles. If a family principle is kindness and someone is  not being kind, what then......do we say (and i realize I&#39;m betraying my schoolishness and boy is it in there am boy am I trying every day to get it out)blah, do we say &quot;hey thats unkind&quot; or &quot; hey, I&#39;m getting hurt&quot; or&quot;is that kind?&quot; or &quot;stop!&quot; (if its an emergency)......I know it depends on the situation but at this house I&#39;m driving myself crazy with the constant guidnace thats needed.....I think its needed, anyway..........blah, sigh or do we let them do what they&#39;re doing, even though its not kind and hope they become kind..?no of course not. I know to not yell, and to choose my words carefully but I think I&#39;m starting to sound like a broken record...here and here :)<br/>
Maybe , I&#39;ll write down a specific situation and example it here. I thoght I had one from yesterday but then I promptly forgot it so here I am rambling.........maybe theres a book someone recommended and I missed it......and maybe i need to start there...but I , &quot;I&quot; need specific examples to spark me and give me the idea.......<br/>
<br/>
ok, done. but please offer a response.....somebody :)<br/>

&quot;Yes, but that won&#39;t work because...&quot;<br/>
--my kid is gifted<br/>
--my kid needs structure<br/>
--my relatives are all educators<br/>
--my husband is an engineer<br/>
--i  have  a  strong  work ethic (an actual quote from a recent<br/>
e-mail<br/>
from  someone  explaining  to  me that she would not be able to<br/>
stay home<br/>
with a child, because she had a strong work ethic)<br/>
Learning  works  at  the  edge  of what a person already knows.<br/>
It&#39;s a<br/>
building  on  and  connecting  to  what&#39;s  already familiar and<br/>
interesting.<br/>
No one can install knowledge into another person.  You can fill<br/>
the<br/>
air  (or the screen, or a paper, or a painting, or a song) with<br/>
ideas<br/>
and  clues,  but each listener/reader/viewer is left to pick up<br/>
and<br/>
insert  clues  or  not.   They can try those puzzle pieces into<br/>
their own<br/>
a-building  universe  and keep or reject them.  They can frolic<br/>
for a<br/>
moment or an hour with an idea they later abandon.<br/>
People have come to more localized lists asking things like &quot;Is<br/>
there<br/>
anyone  here  with  an eight year old girl?&quot;   Not even &quot;in the<br/>
seven-to-<br/>
ten-year-old  range&quot;  but  eight  (8).  Girl.  WHY!?  It really<br/>
shouldn&#39;t<br/>
matter.   Choosing  friends by birthday and gender is more like<br/>
school<br/>
than  diagramming  sentences is.  Finding a list of unschooling<br/>
parents<br/>
of eight year old girls would be too.<br/>
No  one  but  maybe a koala  or an aphid would eat all his food<br/>
off the<br/>
same  tree  for  life.   Living in a fully wide world means not<br/>
looking<br/>
for a narrowly-defined corner of it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s not about how children learn.<br/>
<br/>
Some parents new to homeschooling try to recreate schoolishness down  <br/>
to thinking their children need to be with children their own age,  <br/>
and that their friends need to be in the same neighborhood, and be  <br/>
like them.<br/>
<br/>
That makes life smaller, not larger.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling needs a big real world, not a limited little world.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I have alot more questions and am one of those globbing people  <br/>
about the rules vs principles.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know &quot;globbing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-If a family principle is kindness -=-<br/>
<br/>
Then the parents should be as kind as possible and try to keep their  <br/>
children in situations where they&#39;re experiencing kindness.  Instead  <br/>
of trying to control the children&#39;s actions to ensure kindness, be  <br/>
and create more kindness in which they can bask and dwell.<br/>
<br/>
A principle would be that kindness breeds kindness.<br/>
A principle would be that it&#39;s a parent&#39;s duty to keep each child as  <br/>
safe and as comfortable in his own home as possible.<br/>
<br/>
-=-do we say &quot;hey thats unkind&quot; or &quot; hey, I&#39;m getting hurt&quot; or&quot;is  <br/>
that kind?&quot; or &quot;stop!&quot; (if its an emergency)......I know it depends  <br/>
on the situation but at this house I&#39;m driving myself crazy with the  <br/>
constant guidnace thats needed.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It depends.<br/>
Sometimes you negotiate with another person to act differently, and  <br/>
sometimes it&#39;s easier to rearrange people and places so that the  <br/>
difficulty is diffused without words and directives and &quot;guidance.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Planning ahead to give kids more room and attention is easier than  <br/>
trying to coach them through crowded situations, or to reason with  <br/>
them after they&#39;re already cranky and responding badly.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I know to not yell, and to choose my words carefully but I think  <br/>
I&#39;m starting to sound like a broken record..-=-<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re saying the same thing over and over, it&#39;s not working.    <br/>
Try running the situation back to see what led to the difficulty and  <br/>
see if you can&#39;t prevent it at an earlier point next time.  Is the  <br/>
child unkind because he&#39;s not feeling heard, or he&#39;s hungry, or he  <br/>
hasn&#39;t been out of the house for two days?<br/>
<br/>
Rather than trying to change their actions, it&#39;s often easier to (and  <br/>
almost always better) to change your own.<br/>
