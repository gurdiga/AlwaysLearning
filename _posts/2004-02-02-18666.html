<div id="ygrps-yiv-1887435125">My 6 year old daughter, Daisy, really likes to have something to do while we <br/>
drive.  Music has always been a huge help, even for short drives around <br/>
town.  Sometimes on longer drives we listen to books on tape.  We&#39;ve had a <br/>
lot of fun lately playing &quot;animal, vegetable, or mineral.&quot;  If it&#39;s a short <br/>
drive, we might get in only two or three games; we&#39;ve played it as long as <br/>
half an hour on other occasions.<br/>
______<br/>
So if anyone has any other car game ideas to pass the time I need some more<br/>
ideas.  Somehow I seem to be drawing a blank on this...  Perhaps I grew up<br/>
in a &quot;Dad expects us to sit quietly in the back seat&quot; family because I<br/>
can&#39;t think of a single thing that I used to have fun with in the car when<br/>
I was a kid.<br/>
