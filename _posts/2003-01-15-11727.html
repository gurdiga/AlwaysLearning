<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Okay, I need a little reality check.  ...alright, I need a BIG reality <br/>
&gt; check.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s the situation.<br/>
&gt; I have two kids.  One is 16, Rachael, awesome (of course), who was in a <br/>
&gt; &#39;progressive&#39; private school (her decision) until 8th grade, then a charter <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; high for a few months, and is now unschooling her high school years.  The <br/>
&gt; second kid, Damian is 13, in seventh grade at the same &#39;progressive&#39; <br/>
&gt; private school in 7th grade (it goes to 8th), is dyslexic so he writes <br/>
&gt; extremely slowly but loves the school for its Acivities (he&#39;s making <br/>
&gt; chainmail at the moment) and his friends there.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Damian was having a meltdown a few months back over homework he wasn&#39;t able <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; to get done in time - and he was exhausted, it was late, etc, etc.  I wrote <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; on his homework that I was not going to require him to do homework during <br/>
&gt; family time and at Damian&#39;s request, wrote another note saying that this <br/>
&gt; idea was mine, not Damians.  (He wanted the teacher to not get mad at <br/>
&gt; him.)  I later confirmed with the teacher that life was okay with this <br/>
&gt; decision and she made some murmurings about it being alright and that <br/>
&gt; they&#39;d find a way to get the work done in school or something.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I just found out how she&#39;s been getting her work done.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She&#39;s been keeping Damian in during lunch EVERY SINGLE DAY to get his &#39;LATE <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; WORK&#39; done.  He can&#39;t remember the last time he had a lunch free.  Every <br/>
&gt; single day his friends from 7th and 8th grade have been gathering on the <br/>
&gt; steps to chat, reconnect, plan after-school activities and eat their <br/>
&gt; lunches... and Damian&#39;s been kept inside.  I just had a <br/>
&gt; trying-to-be-nonchalant-but-not-very-effectively chat with the boy about it <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; and he seems to feel that he NEEDS to do the homework because otherwise <br/>
&gt; he&#39;s not going to learn anything and he wants to be successful with his <br/>
&gt; life.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m about to scream with rage and frustration, not at the boy, but at the <br/>
&gt; teacher and the stupid ficking society that says homework is more important <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; than family, friends, activities and that if it&#39;s not done, a kid will be <br/>
&gt; stupid and not have a good life.  Never MIND that it&#39;s costing an arm and a <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; leg to keep him in the stupid fricking school too!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I want to pull him immediately, even though it&#39;s his choice to BE at that <br/>
&gt; school because that viewpoint is so whacked out I can hardly stand it.  I <br/>
&gt; want to un-brainwash him!   I want an intervention!!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I want to honor his wishes to stay with his friends at the school, but I <br/>
&gt; also don&#39;t know how much of that desire is prompted by the idea that if <br/>
&gt; he&#39;s not &#39;taught&#39;, he won&#39;t learn anything, so he needs a &#39;teacher&#39;, <br/>
&gt; complete with homework.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Intending to bolster the argument about not needing homework and the joys <br/>
&gt; of unschooling, I asked Rachael to talk about how she&#39;s doing with the <br/>
&gt; unschooling thing and she said, &quot;I don&#39;t agree with having homework, but <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m learning jack-shit.&quot;  Blew me out of the water.  Here&#39;s a bright, <br/>
&gt; intelligent girl who can dye hair almost any color (usually a bright one), <br/>
&gt; can build webpages, work with digital images, handle more than 5 chat rooms <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; at a time, taught herself to knit, planned her own trip to Oregon on <br/>
&gt; Amtrak, including paying for it... and all she can say is that she doesn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; know geometry well enough.  I ask her why she thinks she&#39;ll need geometry <br/>
&gt; and can&#39;t she brush up on it when she really needs it and she just <br/>
&gt; shrugs.  Meanwhile her brother is sitting there just nodding his head, <br/>
&gt; saying, &quot;see what I mean?&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ARGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I finally told them that they had <br/>
&gt; blown me out of the water and I needed a little while alone to write to you <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; guys and figure out what is going on (and maybe even get some suggestions <br/>
&gt; on how to handle it.)  I also wasn&#39;t the coolest because I just went inside <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; to find Rae with one of her unschooling buddies (my honorary second <br/>
&gt; daughter) and I blew up, asking the buddy to explain to Rae how bright and <br/>
&gt; intelligent she is and how few other kids would be able to manage to get <br/>
&gt; themselves up to Oregon and back again successfully on their own, yadda, <br/>
&gt; yadda, yadda.  I then proceeded to burst into tears.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Way to stay cool, mom.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, any ideas?<br/>
&gt; Heidi-the-blown-away-and-seriously-mind-ficked...<br/>
&gt; Where is my Tahitian island when I need it?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Argh! <br/>
I have a few ideas that MIGHT help....<br/>
Re: Damian and the Pooky Old School.... You say it&#39;s costing you $1000 a <br/>
month to keep him in school...What about BRIBERY????  What if you offered him <br/>
not only the opportunity to do LOTS of cool Learny things, but also CASH? <br/>
Tell him you really believe school is bad for him, and that you also respect <br/>
that it needs to be his choice...but that you&#39;re willing to make it worth his <br/>
while.  Might also be a good time to assign a little REQUIRED reading (LOL) <br/>
to both kids....maybe Teeenage Liberation Handbook, or maybe actually pay for <br/>
a phone appointment with Grace Llewellyn?<br/>
<br/>
Kids (and the rest of us) are bombarded by all those academic messages, and <br/>
it&#39;s hard to overcome them. But if your daughter isn&#39;t learning anything (and <br/>
maybe she&#39;s not), it&#39;s HER responsibility. I assume you&#39;re willing to offer <br/>
most resources she wants.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a freshman in college I transferred from a plain old regular <br/>
college to a cool hippy college. I was bored, and I figured if I went to the <br/>
cool college and was bored (or certainly, not learning) it was my own fault. <br/>
Same thing with unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it would be good for your kids to connect with more unschooling (and <br/>
happy) kids? <br/>
<br/>
By the way, my son is making chain mail too. Those rings remind one of the <br/>
Leggo days, don&#39;t they? Almost as painful to step on.<br/>
