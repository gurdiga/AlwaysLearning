<div id="ygrps-yiv-209176269">Hi everyone!  I was wondering if any of you knew of any websites for <br/>
getting penpals that are good (and SAFE) for kids.  We want just a <br/>
few from other countries.  When I did a search engine..  &quot;Penpals for <br/>
children&quot;.... ya know what came up?....  penpals with prisoners... <br/>
(top three) and then... a child murder or lost child....  how <br/>
freakishly weird is that?.. anyway...  anyone able to help... my <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1532145680">Hi, there is a website for homeschooler&#39;s that has a pen pal page.  The website is - A to Z Home&#39;s Cool.  They offer an array of things for home schooled kids of all ages.  Good luck.<br/>

She used to (might still) have an anti-unschooling article up, under <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
When I objected, she said she wanted to have a balanced presentation, but I <br/>
also had the impression she hadn&#39;t really read it, just linked it.  :-/ <br/>
<br/>
But there IS a ton of stuff there.  <br/>
