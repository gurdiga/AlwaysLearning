<div id="ygrps-yiv-1501876111">My 12 year old loves to play this game on Steam. While he&#39;s waiting for it to open the game gives facts about bananas. He keeps talking about bananas and giving me all these facts and information. Fun and interesting information that I never knew about bananas. He loves that he is helping me to learn new things. It&#39;s pretty cute. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe, just maybe, he will be a banana farmer in Hawaii and I&#39;ll get to live there with him.....Hey, a mom can dream. <br/>

Tori, I want to start a page with this, on people&#39;s &quot;own certain knowledge&quot; that their children can learn.<br/>
<br/>
As you say, it starts off trusting other people&#39;s stories, but at some point, with each person, it becomes personal.  Maybe they used to think it could happen.  Then one day they *know.*<br/>
<br/>
One of the sessions I led last weekend was about that very thing.  Here was the description:<br/>
<br/>
_____________________<br/>
<br/>
Your Own Certain Knowledge<br/>
<br/>
Vague interest can turn to trust in others&#39; accounts of learning and of parenting successes.  Trust in those stories can give us courage to experiment, and from that we can discover our own proofs and truths to share with newer unschoolers, who might find courage from that to try these things themselves.  Faith in others can only take us a little way, though, and then our own children&#39;s learning will carry us onward.    Some ideas become theories.  A few theories might turn to convictions.   Some early thoughts will be abandoned; others will gain substance.  After  much thought and use, what is left will be what you believe because you have lived it.<br/>
<br/>
Share (if you wish to) a moment when learning surprised you in a profound way.<br/>

<br/>
It went well, but it wasn&#39;t the time to be taking notes.  At least three people got tears in their eyes.   I did a similar one (less tearful) last May in Minneapolis.<br/>

He and I were in the bathroom and he moved in front of me and declared &quot;I am in front of you.&quot; Then he moved next to me and said &quot;I am beside you&quot; and so on. That was a huge aha moment for me. This exercise of positions was a kindergarten worksheet being done in real life not on paper and just because he figured it out.

<br>She and her brother ask things like this pretty regularly, and I think it&#39;s so cool that they spend time thinking about numbers and math &quot;just because,&quot; and also to hear the different ways that they calculate sums in their heads.  If they were in school, there would be *one* way to come up with a sum, but they get to play around with numbers, turn them around in their heads, and discover the beauty of math for themselves.</div>

He and I were in the bathroom and he moved in front of me and declared &quot;I am in front of you.&quot; Then he moved next to me and said &quot;I am beside you&quot; and so on. That was a huge aha moment for me. This exercise of positions was a kindergarten worksheet being done in real life not on paper and just because he figured it out. I have seen many more examples of this as the years have gone on. </p>

Tori, I want to start a page with this, on people&#39;s &quot;own certain knowledge&quot; that their children can learn.<br>

<br>
_____________________<br>
<br>
Your Own Certain Knowledge<br>
<br>
Vague interest can turn to trust in others&#39; accounts of learning and of parenting successes.  Trust in those stories can give us courage to experiment, and from that we can discover our own proofs and truths to share with newer unschoolers, who might find courage from that to try these things themselves.  Faith in others can only take us a little way, though, and then our own children&#39;s learning will carry us onward.    Some ideas become theories.  A few theories might turn to convictions.   Some early thoughts will be abandoned; others will gain substance.  After  much thought and use, what is left will be what you believe because you have lived it.<br>

<br>
Share (if you wish to) a moment when learning surprised you in a profound way.<br>

It went well, but it wasn&#39;t the time to be taking notes.  At least three people got tears in their eyes.   I did a similar one (less tearful) last May in Minneapolis.<br>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I thought similarly, especially with math.  <br/>
<br/>
I wrote this today on Facebook for no particular reason other than to share something I thought might be interesting for people.  I think it applies in this instance as well.  Forgive me, I am copying and pasting:<br/>
<br/>
**************<br/>
Still suffering from jet lag, I found myself awake again at 2:30am. This time, though, Ethan was standing beside my bed saying he couldn&#39;t sleep. So, I got up and climbed into his loft bed with him. We laid (lay, lie?) awake together in the dark, touching the ceiling, talking about the statistics in a game Ethan (and Doug and I) plays. Great Sam! That child knows his material! And, he can use what he knows to make comparisons and projections. He talks in ratios and percents and throws in simple equations. None of it inspired by a single math work page or lesson. All of it inspired by a desire to better understand a game he loves playing. After at least 30 minutes of listening I told Ethan I was starting to get a bit sleepy. He said &quot;That was fun (meaning our wee hours chat). I love sharing my knowledge! It makes me feel good about myself. It makes me feel happy.&quot; I slept well after that.<br/>
**************<br/>
<br/>
My son, at ten, has a deeper understanding of math than I did after I-don&#39;t-know-how-many years of doing math in school.  He seems to be like his dad that way.  He particularly doesn&#39;t care to draw or paint.  He&#39;s not like me that way.  He&#39;s very creative though.  He&#39;s himself.  And he finds what he needs to be the best self he can be.  Not for teachers.  Not for parents.  For himself.  That&#39;s just so cool in my opinion.</div>
