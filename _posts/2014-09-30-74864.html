<div id="ygrps-yiv-1269406548">I wrote this to someone I&#39;ve know since she was two years old.  She has two children, and is somewhat antagonistic with them.  She posted on her page that she felt like she wasn&#39;t as good a mom as she could be, and she got &quot;support&quot; in the form of &quot;stop, you&#39;re great, we&#39;re all great moms, you&#39;re awesome, don&#39;t worry&quot; so I wrote on the side with some links.   <br/>
<br/>
She wrote nicely, and said she wasn&#39;t aware that she comes across as resentful.  Most people here would have spotted it and mentioned it immediately, if she had written here. :-)  But she&#39;s not planning to homeschool, though she was homeschooled.  She married into more academic people, I guess (someone she met in college (university level, for non-US readers, but it&#39;s &quot;an institute of technology&quot;—specialty things).    ANYway...<br/>

Thanks for reading what I sent. <br/>

&quot;Strong willed&quot; is an insult.  It&#39;s a wedge between you.  &quot;Stubborn&quot; is worse.   He&#39;s not easily manipulated?  That&#39;s good.  He&#39;s brave and strong in his self-knowledge?  That&#39;s hugely important for a man, so help that blossom rather than trying to undo it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-675054425"><div dir="ltr">Language is so interesting. Sandra, I was surprised to see you write &quot;&#39;strong-willed&#39; is an insult&quot; as I have always seen it, and used it, as a distinctly positive trait-- much like determined or persistent. Out of curiosity, I just asked my ten year old, &quot;Hey, if someone described a person as strong-willed would you think they were saying something bad or good about them? Or neither?&quot; and he said, &quot;Strong-willed? That&#39;s a good thing.&quot; But I think often the implied meaning and connotation is apparent from the larger context of the speaker&#39;s (or writer&#39;s) words, as in the situation you describe here. <br><br>I read an article online yesterday that looked people&#39;s political views (liberal/conservative) and how those correlated with their ideas about what qualities they saw as important to pass on to their children (just something someone had posted on Facebook- not worth looking up). Some qualities did vary with political views, of course- for example, those who said they were conservative were more likely to value hard work, obedience and religious beliefs, while self-identified liberals put emphasis on empathy and helping others. <br><br>But what struck me were two qualities that were at the bottom of the list for both groups- curiosity and persistence. Both are qualities I value highly and want to nurture in my son (and in myself, for that matter) but I can imagine that they are also, for some fairly traditional parents, challenging. A child who is full of curiosity and bursting with questions about everything-- and who doesn&#39;t give up easily-- may be harder to parent for someone who has the idea that children should be compliant and obedient. And I think the same is probably true of strong-willed children. </div></div>

 </span></blockquote>That might depend where it&#39;s being used. I&#39;ve only heard persistent used positively in the East. Occasionally I&#39;ve heard the backhanded complement, &quot;My he&#39;s very persistent, isn&#39;t he?&quot; type of statement. But most often it&#39;s used to mean persevering.<br/>

When someone uses a word like &quot;persistence&quot; or &quot;strong-willed&quot; about their child, meaning it as a criticism, I can see that it could be useful to suggest a different word, like &quot;determined. I think it could also be useful to point out that some of the qualities that can be challenging to parents of young children can also be the same qualities that may be useful to the child as he or she matures. I know that this has been a perspective that has been helpful for me as a parent. </span></font></div></div></div>
