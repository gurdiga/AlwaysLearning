<div id="ygrps-yiv-1728000505">I wanted to ask how folks have managed moving while unschooling.  We have 6<br/>
people in a small house and are at a point where we could manage a move<br/>
financially.<br/>
<br/>
BUT,  the thought of showing our house overwhelms me and/or cause me to<br/>
laugh hysterically.  Living with four curious and busy youngsters does not<br/>
allow for the *good housekeeping* look.  And the thought of bucking down on<br/>
everyone to keep things *tidy* turns my stomach.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m quite certain I&#39;m not as inspiring (as used in the thread on persuaion<br/>
and coerciveness) as Sandra......so I need some lessons on inspiring<br/>
(especially the one dd who doesn&#39;t want to move)  AND some guidance and/or<br/>
stories of how people managed showing/selling the house with little ones<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My sister in law did this.  She&#39;s not a homeschooler but here&#39;s how she<br/>
did it.  <br/>
<br/>
She used a realtor and arranged for them to only show the house on Wed<br/>
afternoons.  Wed. mornings she cleaned  house and left.  The realtor<br/>
would always call on Mon or Tue to let her know if she had folks lined<br/>
up, and once in a while there was a mix up.   Her kids were in school<br/>
part of the afternoon and then went skating so no one was home again<br/>
until six or so.  <br/>
I guess you could always just show it to other unschoolers.&lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We have never moved as unschoolers but we did move when my children were small and not in ps.  There is no question that showing a house is stressfull especially if you want to get top dollar and are willing to do the extra work.  It took us two years to get our house in selling shape.  By the time we were ready to sell, we had to repaint some areas because of finger prints.  All our walls are now painted with semi-gloss or eggshell paint and I wipe finger prints off more regularly.<br/>
<br/>
Every morning go through a routine to pull the house together.  Wipe out sinks, flush toilets, pick clothes and towels up off the floor, make beds and vacuum areas that seem to need it.  Get some decorative large baskets and put one in each room that the kids use the most.  When you get a call from the realtor, go around and put toys and stuff in the baskets and leave the house.  Try to stay on top of dishes and wipe up as you go.  Hopefully the house will sell quickly.  Good luck.<br/>

Well, we have stories about deciding instead to build a second floor. My kids <br/>
now know a lot about appraisals and financing &lt;gg&gt;.<br/>

<br/>
We just moved last year with two toddlers and two dogs (well, and two <br/>
parents,as well ).  Our solution was to sell our home ourselves.  It worked <br/>
out really well since I got to make all the appointments and I knew when <br/>
people were coming.  There was a company in VT (where we lived) that listed <br/>
your home on their website, in their FSBO catalog and gave you all the <br/>
paperwork.  It only cost about $300 for 3 months listing.  We sold our house <br/>
for our asking price to the 7th viewers.  In all I showed the house 10 times <br/>
in 20 days, but a couple times I had more than one showing in a day.  It was <br/>
easier to be able to do my own scheduling.  That way if the girls were having <br/>
a yucky day or I just did not feel like dealing with anyone, I did not have <br/>
to.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps there is a similar service near you.  You can also just go ahead and <br/>
do it through the classified ads.  The lawyer&#39;s fees were taken out of our <br/>
&quot;profit&quot;, but only came to a few hundred dollars.  It was very empowering, <br/>
too, to realize that we could do such a major business deal without a <br/>
middleperson who would take such an amazing amount of our &quot;profit.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck!!<br/>

&gt; Susan<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We sold the house ourselves over a weekend.<br/>
<br/>
We were browsing a book store and saw a book titled &quot;How to sell your House<br/>
(Home?) in Five Days.&quot; We bought it and followed its outline.<br/>
<br/>
It worked.<br/>
<br/>
The premise is essentially that you are having your own auction. The first<br/>
three days, Wednesday through Friday, are spent advertising and making final<br/>
preparations. You show the house on Saturday and Sunday while the kids are<br/>
away with your spouse or a friend or relative. Interested parties leave<br/>
their Names, phone numbers and what they are willing to pay. At 6pm on<br/>
Sunday you call the highest bidders letting them know where they stand,<br/>
allow them to modify their bids and continue till you&#39;ve reached the highest<br/>
price they are willing to spend.<br/>
<br/>
There are a few details that were crucial to how our sale went but the two<br/>
main concepts that we were willing to function with were: 1, There are only<br/>
so many people in the market to buy a house like ours at any one time. They<br/>
can come by and look at the house over months or over the weekend. 2, The<br/>
house is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it. What we think it<br/>
is worth doesn&#39;t matter.<br/>
<br/>
We still had to make the house more than presentable, but it only had to be<br/>
that way for a weekend.<br/>
<br/>
The price we got for our house was about 3 percent under market. Since we<br/>
did not have to pay realtor commission, we netted 3 percent over market.<br/>
<br/>
With a new job 1500 miles away, starting in three weeks we were so relived<br/>
to be landless peasants again. &lt;G&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One of the things we did as part of preparing the house, was not only throw<br/>
a bunch of junk away &lt;g&gt;, but put a bunch of stuff in storage.  We knew<br/>
where we were moving (from TX to CA) and Dan had reason to make a trip out<br/>
several weeks before the actual move, so we loaded up the truck and moved to<br/>
Beverly...  In reality, we rented the largest UHaul truck available and<br/>
packed up more than half of our stuff, which he then drove out to CA and put<br/>
in storage.  We repainted the eaves (brick house), did some touch up<br/>
painting inside, cleaned the carpet and washed the windows.  But the single<br/>
best thing we did was DITCH the STUFF.  Made the house look much more um,<br/>
presentable.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-474531032">We have moved 3 times in the last 5 years due to the joys of corporate<br/>
America.  Each time we used a realtor and each time we had an increasing<br/>
number of toddlers.  I simply told the realtors that I have kids, that we<br/>
have a life, that I will do my best to be accomodating, but we are what we<br/>
are.  I kept little snack bags packed in the refrigerator and often went for<br/>
walks when we had short notice of a showing.  Several times we simply stayed<br/>
at the house and &quot;showed off&quot; what we thought we the best features.<br/>
Example:  People coming to look at our house in the heat of Houston in<br/>
August found me and mine cavorting in the cool backyard pool, or playing in<br/>
a &quot;hidden room&quot; upstairs where we had converted an attic to an air<br/>
conditioned playroom.<br/>
<br/>
I did a heavy duty cleaning of the house each week and then we were<br/>
sticklers about puting stuff away when we were finished with is....which is<br/>
very against our nature.<br/>
