<div id="ygrps-yiv-1068233194">Hi, all!  I&#39;m not sure that I&#39;m up for the volume of this list, but I <br/>
had to give it a try because I keep hearing such rave reviews from <br/>
it!  I&#39;m Dana, in Montana, mom to 9.5 yo Lauren and 4 yo Ema, and <br/>
another coming this summer.  I&#39;m list mom to the MontanaUnschoolers <br/>
list, although of the 20 people subscribed I think there are only <br/>
about 3 unschoolers....Really looking forward to getting a lot of <br/>
ONLY unschooling talk for a change!!<br/>
<br/>
Glad to be here!!<br/>

It waxes and wanes.  It seems like just yesterday someone was complaining of <br/>
it being dead.  (Okay, it was probably day before yesterday.)<br/>
<br/>
Three unschooling families is better than none. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Maybe you can bring the other 17 on your list closer to freedom!<br/>

I wish I had no idea what you&#39;re talking about, but it hit me with calm <br/>
recognition...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We have some half-structured moms here and it seems they&#39;re mostly just <br/>
(looking around and preparing to whisper) *lazy.*    And inattentive to the <br/>
children as and where they are.  It seems in a couple of cases they see their <br/>
children the same way I&#39;ve seen teachers see children--as &quot;a hyperactive <br/>
third grader,&quot; or &quot;a difficult boy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s as though the label puts another layer of something between the child <br/>
and the mom.  Connecting didn&#39;t work, and putting them in school didn&#39;t work, <br/>
so they&#39;re going to try being disconnected at home and going to every <br/>
possible homeschooling activity so they feel that they did everything <br/>
possible--except really, truly connecting with the child.  <br/>
<br/>
And that is the end of my sermon to the choir.  <br/>
Sorry about that...<br/>
