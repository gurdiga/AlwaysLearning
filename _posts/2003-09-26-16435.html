<div id="ygrps-yiv-1295157175">My daughter, who is five, has been doing this for<br/>
years--writing letters and other things to us and<br/>
other folks and, occasionally, bringing them to me to<br/>
read.  Before they were scribbles, now they are<br/>
letters (though not English words--I hesitate not to<br/>
call them words at all because technically they can be<br/>
pronounced even if I don&#39;t know what they mean!), and<br/>
my response to her has always been the same.  I read<br/>
what I think they mean.  If I am wrong, she corrects<br/>
me very matter of factly.  Oh, I say, and that&#39;s the<br/>
end of it.  I&#39;ve found that asking her to read it to<br/>
me, when she has specifically asked me to read it to<br/>
her, just gets her irritated.  No, Mama, YOU do it! <br/>
So I do.<br/>
<br/>
Just my experience.<br/>

communication.  Of course her reading it to you wouldn&#39;t accomplish that.<br/>
