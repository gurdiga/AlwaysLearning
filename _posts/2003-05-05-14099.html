<div id="ygrps-yiv-368132494">My dd was 3 1/2 weeks &#39;early&#39; and I knew exactly when she was concieved.  My <br/>
midwife stripped my membranes that early because my baby seemed big (turned <br/>
out she just had a HUGE placenta) But she was a very healthey 6lbs 14oz and <br/>
very alert and definatly didn&#39;t seem 3 1/2 weeks early to anyone.  She <br/>
probably could have gone another week or so just for size.<br/>
<br/>
My son was born 1 day before his &#39;due date&#39; at my insistance (castor oild <br/>
induction :P blech) because he &#39;felt&#39; late too me.  Even though my midwife <br/>
said it was normal to go up to 2 weeks over the due date.  Again I knew <br/>
exactly when he was concieved.  And he was 10lbs 9oz.  My midwife was very <br/>
glad I had the insite to say &quot;no, he needs to be born NOW we can&#39;t wait two <br/>
more weeks to see if he comes on his own!&quot;  :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d hate to think how big he would have gotten in two more weeks!!<br/>
<br/>
What we&#39;ve decided is I just cook em faster.  Mine take only about 37 weeks <br/>
to reach full term.  It&#39;s legened that some women are pregnant for for 10 or <br/>
11 months and have perfectly normal babies.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not all that far fetched really.  Elephants are pregnant for what like <br/>
a year and a half or something and cats are only a few weeks.  It would be <br/>
silly to assume that ALL humans gestate for exactly 40 weeks.<br/>
