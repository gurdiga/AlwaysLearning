said, &quot;What?  You look really happy.&quot;   I just started laughing and  <br/>

Is that some kind of Lego Simms game??   Would it be possible for you  <br/>
to let me have a still of the Lego guy with the Learn Nothing Day  <br/>
&quot;shirt&quot; on?<br/>
<br/>
I like the moonwalking part (if it was; seemed so).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-807946672">That is Roblox.com an online place MD loves to play. He also has made his own games on it.<br/>
It is a cool place.<br/>
I will send you a picture of the Roblox with the shirt.<br/>
Do you want the paper bag over his head?<br/>
I can also change his color to anything you want.<br/>
Let me know!<br/>
