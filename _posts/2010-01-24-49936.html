<div id="ygrps-yiv-542757052">I&#39;ve been reading all this wonderful discussion on food and I&#39;m wondering if anyone has any suggestions for me.  My son loves high fructose corn syrup because it give him a &quot;high&quot; feeling where he runs around laughing hysterically and having alot of energy.  However, after this reaction subsides, he becomes very angry and sad and acts out aggressively.  I&#39;ve tried talking to him about this, but he sees me as trying to take away his &quot;high&quot; feeling that he likes by suggesting that maybe the corn syrup is bad for him.  I don&#39;t want to tell him he cannot have the corn syrup.  I want him to be free to make his own choices.   I have no problems allowing him to have sugar as much as he wants and so I buy products with sugar instead of corn syrup.  He says that he wants the corn syrup ones because he wants the &quot;high&quot; feeling.  He doesn&#39;t connect the angry feelings with the &quot;high&quot; feelings and talking hasn&#39;t helped.  Should I just buy a bunch of corn syrup products and let him have at it, hoping that someday he&#39;ll make the connection?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Did you tell him about that high and describe it to him yourself?   <br/>
Because honestly, there is a young wives&#39; tale that sugar makes kids  <br/>
high, but the evidence is against it.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps if it&#39;s restricted,  he gets happy to have it.<br/>

My thought was that you probably told him it would give him a high, he  <br/>
would like to have a high, he looks for it, acts out, you react, he  <br/>
reacts, then you say &quot;bad&quot; then you seem &quot;bad.&quot;<br/>

commenting on his behavior before he got angry each time.<br/>

<br/>
Ah.<br/>
I think you should not &quot;buy a bunch&quot; of anything.  I think you should  <br/>
stop trying to ban corn syrup, be casual and calm, don&#39;t make a big  <br/>
deal either way, and hopfully someday you&#39;ll see that there was no  <br/>
connection.<br/>
<br/>
Be his partner, not his adversary.   Don&#39;t make it him and corn syrup  <br/>
against you and your talking.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-383318392">Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
First off, I not only respect your opinion on sugar not causing hyperactivity but agree with it myself.  We eat sugar in many forms and have no reactions to it.  Two of my children have corn syrup without any reactions.  My son, however, does seem to have a reaction to it.  I liken it to when I take cough syrup and I feel &quot;spacey&quot;.  I know that others do not have this same reaction to cough syrup.  It is simply how my body reacts to it.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Did you tell him about that high and describe it to him yourself?&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
No, I did not. When he asked me to buy the popsicles from the store (those with corn syrup in them), I asked him why he liked those better than the ones I make or the ones we get from the health store.  He told me they make him feel &quot;high&quot; and &quot;really happy&quot;.  I asked what he meant by &quot;high&quot; and he said &quot;lots of energy&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Perhaps if it&#39;s restricted,  he gets happy to have it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This may be true and so I posted this post as trying to implement a very free, have all you want, approach.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot; My thought was that you probably told him it would give him a high, he  would like to have a high, he looks for it, acts out, you react, he reacts, then you say &quot;bad&quot; then you seem &quot;bad.&quot;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t mean to suggest that I ever tell him it is bad.  He has used this interpretation and so perhaps my efforts to help him understand that different foods may make his body feel differently, has given him an impression of &quot;bad&quot;.  This is completely my fault and I need to see how I am talking to him.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Perhaps if you drop the whole thing completely and entirely and let  him have what he wants, after a while there will be nothing to act and react about on either side.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps this is true and I certainly hope that it is.  I guess my real question is one that should be reserved for a later date should it become necessary:  &quot;what if he has all he wants and has continual ups and downs which affect not only him, but everyone around him?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot; Maybe the talking is contributing to the anger.  I bet you were  <br/>
 commenting on his behavior before he got angry each time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I have never commented on his behavior until he got angry and started acting aggressively.  I do not mind him having alot of energy and laughing hysterically.  I do not like it when he starts hitting his siblings or yelling at people around him.<br/>
<br/>
&quot; I think you should not &quot;buy a bunch&quot; of anything.  I think you should  stop trying to ban corn syrup, be casual and calm, don&#39;t make a big  deal either way, and hopfully someday you&#39;ll see that there was no  connection.<br/>
<br/>
Be his partner, not his adversary.   Don&#39;t make it him and corn syrup  against you and your talking.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is the answer I was most looking for. I do hope there is not a real connection.  However, I do believe that people do have allergic or adverse reactions to substances, for whatever unknown reason.  I do also believe that these reactions or allergies can disappear over time.<br/>

<br/>
Happy makes people feel energetic.<br/>
If he&#39;s happier with some that are long and skinny than short and fat,  <br/>
that wouldn&#39;t mean skinny made him high.<br/>
<br/>
Scientifically speaking, unless you had some that were identical  <br/>
except for sugar or corn syrup, you wouldn&#39;t know that was the  <br/>
difference.<br/>
Now that you mention that the choices were home made, health store or  <br/>
&quot;corn syrup,&quot; it seems much different to me.   Health-food-store  <br/>
popsicles often have all the parts of the plants and are bitter,  <br/>
especially the pineapple ones.  Some people like jelly much more than  <br/>
they like jam because they don&#39;t like the texture of the skins and  <br/>
seeds of the fruit, but they do like the juice and the flavor.  Some  <br/>
people only like strained orange juice.   Maybe it&#39;s a texture thing  <br/>
with him.<br/>
<br/>
-=Actually, I have never commented on his behavior until he got angry  <br/>

<br/>
Okay.  Let&#39;s say you have a child who becomes aggressive and hits and  <br/>
yells.  Rather than looking for a cause, coach him about how to deal  <br/>
with anger.  Or be there before the anger and hitting and yelling  <br/>
start.  Maybe the siblings were being irritating.  Maybe they did NOT  <br/>
like his energy and laughter.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the corn syrup has nothing on earth to do with it.  Maybe corn  <br/>
syrup does.  (I seriously doubt it.)  But either way, he needs to  <br/>
learn to deal with being kind and gentle, not deprived of food.<br/>
<br/>
-=- However, I do believe that people do have allergic or adverse  <br/>
reactions to substances, for whatever unknown reason. I do also  <br/>
believe that these reactions or allergies can disappear over time.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I agree with you but I&#39;m also absolutely positive there are mothers  <br/>
who hope their kids have an allergy because it&#39;s kind of a fad, and so  <br/>
if the need for the child to have an allergy goes away, the mom can  <br/>
say he grew out of the allergy.  I know people can grow out of some  <br/>
allergies, and into some others, over the course of a lifetime.  In  <br/>
recent years it&#39;s much more common for mothers to grow out of the need  <br/>
for a child to have an allergy.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Absolutely.  I&#39;ve given up telling folks that sugar doesn&#39;t make kids hyper, they simply don&#39;t believe it.  The link below will take you to a sweet little article that sums up the research done on this topic.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/5uene7">http://tinyurl.com/5uene7</a><br/>
<br/>
Most interesting to me was the study where they told the moms they were testing for the effects of sugar on behavior, but they were really testing the moms&#39; reactions.  It&#39;s in the article linked above, but here&#39;s the gist:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;why would a sizable chunk of the child-rearing population continue to swear it (the sugar/hyperactivity link) exists? For a crucial piece of the puzzle we turn to the Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology and a 1994 study by Daniel Hoover and Richard Milich, in which they looked at 31 boys ages five to seven and their mothers, all of whom had described their offspring as being &quot;behaviorally affected by sugar.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The mom-son teams were split into the customary two groups: the moms in one were told their sons would be given extra-sugary Kool-Aid, while the others were told their kids were in the control group and would get a drink sweetened with aspartame. In reality, though, the same artificially sweetened stuff was administered to both sets of kids while the women got a sheaf of surveys to fill out. Mothers and children were then videotaped playing together, after which the moms were asked how they thought things went.<br/>
<br/>
What did Hoover and Milich find? You guessed it: the moms who thought they were in the sugar group said their sons acted more hyper. In addition, they tended to hover over their children more during play, offer more criticism of their behavior, etc. The mother-son pairs in the other group were judged by observers to be getting along better. What&#39;s more, those moms who, going into the experiment, most strongly believed their kids were sugar-sensitive also scored highest on a test designed to gauge cognitive rigidity.<br/>
<br/>
From there, of course, it&#39;s not too hard to whip up a hypothesis explaining why the sugar-high myth persists. Having always heard that sugar makes kids act crazy, some parents, particularly those hailing from the control-freak end of the spectrum, may go a little crazy themselves when the sugary stuff enters the picture. In situations where sweets are freely available to their children - like birthday parties or other high-stimulation events - they watch worriedly for any sign of obstreperousness, see it even if it&#39;s not there, call it hyperactivity, and attribute it to the cookies and cake. Kids, meanwhile, typically aren&#39;t oblivious to this sort of anxiety; consciously or not, they may well figure out that after taking on a load of candy they&#39;re expected to run amok and happily oblige.&quot; <br/>

I bet those moms were pretty furious with the researchers and said  <br/>

relieved.   But I know Christians don&#39;t want to hear that nobody  <br/>
believes in the devil except for Christians, when they (at least the  <br/>
Baptist and Pentecostal kind) have been assuring each other that  <br/>
anyone who wasn&#39;t Christian worshipped the devil.<br/>
<br/>
There are very likely people reading who think that mothers who don&#39;t  <br/>
limit sugar must sugar-coat everything!  That there must be ceremonies  <br/>
of ingestion of raw sugar, with nekkid dancing after, or something.    <br/>
Many of the moms who allow sugar in their homes have kids who can  <br/>
ignore it for weeks or months on end.  &quot;Can.&quot;  Not must, not should,  <br/>
not &quot;see?  they discovered the evil on their own.&quot;  Lack of the fear  <br/>
of immediate evil might be one of the requirements for real  <br/>
choicemaking.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2018415062">Yesterday we picked a friend up from a 4-H project.  It was the last day, and a doughnut was involved at the very end.  I sat with a mom as the kids happily lined up to &quot;buy&quot; their doughnuts and she turned to me and said that they had been on a sugar high ever since SMELLING the doughnuts, and now they&#39;d be REALLY crazy.  Huh?  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen this active group of boys play enthusiastically together on many occasions, and my guess is that sugar was probably not always involved.  ;-)  And let&#39;s not forget to mention that they&#39;d been sitting through a class and were probably now really ready to move.<br/>
<br/>
I think some people talk about a sugar high now in such commonly accepted terms, flying in the face of how science has shown us that bodies react to sugar, that its just a short-hand for a group of kids playing energetically.  &quot;Oh, they must be on a sugar high.&quot;<br/>

&gt; &gt; Living in fear about purported truths can make anything seem true.

Truthfully though, it didn&#39;t, and it still doesn&#39;t now that I&#39;ve moved past living in fear.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Absolutely.  I&#39;ve given up telling folks that sugar doesn&#39;t make kids hyper, they simply don&#39;t believe it.  The link below will take you to a sweet little article that sums up the research done on this topic.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Most interesting to me was the study where they told the moms they were testing for the effects of sugar on behavior, but they were really testing the moms&#39; reactions.  It&#39;s in the article linked above, but here&#39;s the gist:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;why would a sizable chunk of the child-rearing population continue to swear it (the sugar/hyperactivity link) exists? For a crucial piece of the puzzle we turn to the Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology and a 1994 study by Daniel Hoover and Richard Milich, in which they looked at 31 boys ages five to seven and their mothers, all of whom had described their offspring as being &quot;behaviorally affected by sugar.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The mom-son teams were split into the customary two groups: the moms in one were told their sons would be given extra-sugary Kool-Aid, while the others were told their kids were in the control group and would get a drink sweetened with aspartame. In reality, though, the same artificially sweetened stuff was administered to both sets of kids while the women got a sheaf of surveys to fill out. Mothers and children were then videotaped playing together, after which the moms were asked how they thought things went.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What did Hoover and Milich find? You guessed it: the moms who thought they were in the sugar group said their sons acted more hyper. In addition, they tended to hover over their children more during play, offer more criticism of their behavior, etc. The mother-son pairs in the other group were judged by observers to be getting along better. What&#39;s more, those moms who, going into the experiment, most strongly believed their kids were sugar-sensitive also scored highest on a test designed to gauge cognitive rigidity.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; From there, of course, it&#39;s not too hard to whip up a hypothesis explaining why the sugar-high myth persists. Having always heard that sugar makes kids act crazy, some parents, particularly those hailing from the control-freak end of the spectrum, may go a little crazy themselves when the sugary stuff enters the picture. In situations where sweets are freely available to their children - like birthday parties or other high-stimulation events - they watch worriedly for any sign of obstreperousness, see it even if it&#39;s not there, call it hyperactivity, and attribute it to the cookies and cake. Kids, meanwhile, typically aren&#39;t oblivious to this sort of anxiety; consciously or not, they may well figure out that after taking on a load of candy they&#39;re expected to run amok and happily oblige.&quot; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-575727681">Hi All! I have perused all comments on this issue and decided to chime in<br/>
about the other evils found in high fructose corn syrup. Perhaps many of you<br/>
are already aware, but I thought I would share my sister&#39;s research: High<br/>
Levels of Mercury in corn syrup. Now retired, and teaching spec ed kids in<br/>
Hawaii, she worked at/for the FDA researching the effects of Mercury<br/>
poisoning in our children, specifically &quot;whistle blowing&quot; that the FDA<br/>
ignored her findings quiet. Her findings have since been published in<br/>
Environmental Health and can be read online and have been echoed and further<br/>
explored by other scientists in the field. She is now working on a<br/>
publication, book, which continues her efforts to educate the public and<br/>
draw pressure on the industrialist machine. Have I stopped buying all<br/>
products containing high fructose corn syrup? No..but knowing what I know<br/>
now, I read the labels, and I sure as heck limit the amounts Eli ingests<br/>
simply by choosing other products that are free of HFCS. He can have all the<br/>
unprocessed natural cane sugar products he wants with the &quot;sugar high&quot; or<br/>
not! The taste is what drives us both!!!!<br/>

No one said corn syrup was a superior substance and we should all  <br/>

dishonest.<br/>

The objection was to baseless limits.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1301811836">I wonder if some of the paranoia concerning kids and sugar has something to do with the over/mis-diagnosis of ADD/ADHD that is now prevalent in our society.  It&#39;s as though people are looking for an excuse as to why their child has sooo much energy, instead of realizing that it is perfectly normal for children to be &quot;in motion&quot; for a good part of their existence.  Having lots of energy is seen as a negative trait in children nowadays it seems.  &quot;Calm down&quot; is a frequent phrase I hear from parents when out in public or at relative&#39;s houses.  I would think that a child that is in school would have even more (pent up) energy than those that are not in school, and thus need more opportunities in which to be free to run and play outdoors or at a bounce house or skating rink, ect...<br/>
<br/>
A good friend of mine (who is also an unschooler), had an experience last summer with a neighbor boy who had come over to play.  The mom walked the boy over and when the neighbor boy and my friends boy saw each other, they sort of went &quot;wild&quot; with excitement to play with each other (perfectly normal in my friends eyes).  They were both whooping and hollering and genuinely excited to be able to play together.  Well, when the mother noticed her son getting excited, she said &quot;oh, I forgot, he hasn&#39;t had his pill&quot;, and my friend said &quot;what?&quot; and the lady said &quot;I need to take him home so he can have his pill&quot;.  My friend &quot;said, &quot;it&#39;s o.k., he&#39;s fine, they just want to play&quot;, but the mother insisted and when he returned, he was noticeably calmer:(  <br/>
<br/>
Two of my nephews have noticeably higher energy than the rest of the nephews which IMO can easily be directed by going and doing something physical outside.  One cousin is on ritalin, and the other was &quot;diagnosed&quot; by his pediatrician to be &quot;borderline ADHD&quot;.  The one that isn&#39;t on ritalin gets a lot of &quot;calm down&#39;s&quot; and/or time out&#39;s because of his high energy levels:(  Interesting to note that neither of my nephews parents having any paranoia  concerning sugar making their kids hyper.  Maybe because they have the ADD/ADHD excuse?<br/>
