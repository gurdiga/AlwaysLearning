  The Scripture doctrines of original sin and total depravity <br/>
should forever end the discussion.<br/>
<br/>
  *****<br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;m reading Eckhart Tolle&#39;s book A New Earth and there&#39;s a great paragraph that immediately came to mind when I read this: <br/>
  &quot;According to Christian teachings, the normal collective state of humanity is one of &#39;original sin&#39;. Sin is a word that has been greatly misunderstood an misinterpreted. Literally translated from the ancient Greek in which the New Testament was written, to sin means to miss the mark, as an archer who missed the target, so to sin means to miss the point of human existence. It means to live unskillfully, blindly, and thus to suffer and cause suffering. Again, the term, stripped of its cultural baggage and misinterpretations, points to the dysfunction inherent in the human condition.&quot;<br/>
  It&#39;s a fantastic book. Full of great mind food &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
   <br/>

wanted to tell me about original sin and total depravity in reference to <br/>
parenting. I doubt that either of us would be able to change the other <br/>
person&#39;s viewpoint.<br/>

moderation, that&#39;s my motto ;)<br/>
I&#39;d have to say that Original Sin is what I&#39;m shooting for with my kids...<br/>
why do the same ol&#39; regular sin, be Original ;-P<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Two really important things that stuck with me after reading the<br/>
Conversations with God series of books (and listening to them! Ellen Burstyn<br/>
& Ed Asner as the *God* voices :::vbg:::)<br/>
1) If we&#39;re all created in the image of &quot;The Creator&quot; then God&#39;s an awful<br/>
lot like me :) Which also means S/he&#39;s far less of the Fire and Brimstone<br/>
model and more of the Kooky Fun model :D<br/>
2) It&#39;s called enlightenment because we&#39;re supposed to &quot;Lighten Up&quot; about it<br/>
:D<br/>
<br/>
If God doesn&#39;t have a sense of humor, especially when it comes to me, I&#39;m<br/>
more okay with staying alive than I once thought ;)<br/>
For now, I&#39;ll listen to some more Depeche Mode and hang onto my deep belief<br/>
that indeed, God has a sick sense of humor and when I die I expect to find<br/>
him laughing :)<br/>

It&#39;s nice to know some things never change.  I haven&#39;t been here in<br/>
forever and a day...now I remember what I love about this list; the<br/>
all-out witty, intelligent humor. <br/>
<br/>
What about original hedonism? Does that count?;)<br/>

Aw gee...now I&#39;m blushing.:)<br/>
I used to be one of the more vocal peeps here, back when Sandra first<br/>
started it. I remember the upheaval that got this one going, as well<br/>
as UB which Kelly and I started. Anyhoo....just decided I was missing<br/>
the old gang.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t know how often I&#39;ll get back, what with apple trees and garden<br/>
and beehives and work and such....but it&#39;s nice to &quot;see&quot; some familiar<br/>
names that aren&#39;t at UB.<br/>
