<div id="ygrps-yiv-2042614346">Has anyone used cuisenaire rods?  What ages were the children who were interested in them?  I&#39;m thinking my 10yo might find them intersting and they can be used for geometry and measuring.  Such a visual manipulative would have been invaluable to me, but I&#39;m a visual person.  I don&#39;t know if they would do anything for my daughter, as she&#39;s very different from me, but quite tactile.  <br/>
 <br/>
Also, any recommendations for finding a decent microscope that  won&#39;t require a 2nd mortgage?<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-973673994">I bought a small set of colored, wooden cuisenaire rods years ago, when I was home&quot;schooling&quot;.  I only used them a few times to demonstrate math, but my kids have always enjoyed them a lot for making pretty designs or as small building blocks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1762154988">We have them.  I sometimes pull them out to make pretty designs :0).  Rowan,<br/>
who&#39;s six, likes to play with them.  Dagny, who&#39;s ten, hasn&#39;t played with<br/>
them much.   I think it&#39;s more a personality thing than an age thing.<br/>
<br/>
Why don&#39;t you just ask your daughter if she wants them?  ~Rue<br/>

We have some.  I put them out on a table from time to time.  People line them <br/>
up and mess with them, and they ARE thinking in terms of measuring and the <br/>
patterns and relationships, but I wouldn&#39;t ask a ten year old to &quot;use them for <br/>
geometry and measuring.&quot;  Just let kids play with them and make patterns.  The <br/>
learning will happen whether it&#39;s verbalized or not.<br/>
