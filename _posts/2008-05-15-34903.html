<div id="ygrps-yiv-783765397">I was quoted in a report (a two-part essay for a writing assignment),  <br/>
and it&#39;s a good one, on video games.<br/>
<br/>
Someone cited it on a Christian homeschooling mom&#39;s blog, and she  <br/>
went off, declared it &quot;horseshit,&quot; and naming people.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve already responded twice.  I thought if anyone here was in a  <br/>
CALM, collected, polite but analytical mood, it might be a topic to  <br/>
look at.  I&#39;m not asking for &quot;support.&quot;  I&#39;m holding my own, and am  <br/>
not worried about the effect on unschoolers at all.  I still thought  <br/>
some of you might find it interesting, or maybe be able to bridge the  <br/>
gap between her beliefs and mine.  Interpreters, perhaps. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you go here I&#39;ve saved the mom&#39;s comments and the link to the essays:<br/>

<br/>
The author doesn&#39;t know he&#39;s being discussed elsewhere so DON&#39;T,  <br/>
please, leave a note about that there.  His mom would like to spare  <br/>
him the knowledge for a while, or maybe always.  I don&#39;t blame her at  <br/>
all.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the not-so-balanced critique:<br/>

<br/>
I used to buy into that anti tv, anti video gaming stuff.   Then I had a<br/>
son who was a &quot;gamer&quot;, and he helped me see the error of my ways. <br/>
Thinking about it though, I don&#39;t think my &quot;gamer&quot; has played a game all<br/>
week... [:O] !!LOL<br/>
<br/>
And her comment about things kids learn from video games can be learned<br/>
in real life...ugh!!  Video gaming is real.  Doesn&#39;t Nintendo spend like<br/>
a billion dollars a year on research alone??  I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s real<br/>
$$!<br/>
<br/>
Closed minds, like this blogger and that anti text article Pam shared<br/>
just irk me!!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll have to give it some time before I can &quot;go gently!&quot; [:D]<br/>

As I read through it, the thought came to my mind, &quot;Where would Shigeru  <br/>
Miyamoto (&quot;father of modern video gaming&quot;) be if his parents had made him put  <br/>
down the drawings and take up a musical instrument or made him read  <br/>
&#39;educational&#39; material or just took his drawing tools from him and declared they  weren&#39;t <br/>
&#39;worthwhile&#39;?&quot; Where would video gaming be today? Where would our kids  be and <br/>
this fun, educational thing the whole family can enjoy? Granted, those  <br/>
probably wouldn&#39;t be good arguments to use in that blog, but to minds that  aren&#39;t <br/>
closed... A second thought occurred to me, where would Kirby be if his  mom <br/>
had said nasty things about video games or banned them from their home?  Which <br/>
of course led me to the thought of: What is possibly being destroyed in  kids <br/>
who&#39;s parents make them feel bad about things they enjoy, who control or  <br/>
forbid things that excite their kids? What might the world be missing out on  <br/>
because these kids weren&#39;t allowed to persue their interests, something they&#39;re  <br/>
good at-something they might be the best in the world at??<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1379158888">I&#39;ve been thrown off that blog now anyway. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.blogspot.com">http://sandradodd.blogspot.com</a><br/>
I commented a bit about it there.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t reviewed carefully, but I think the questions she  <br/>
complained that I didn&#39;t answer were whether I would let my kid smoke  <br/>
a joint or whether I would let one of boys have a Playboy.<br/>
<br/>
Her kids are little.  She doesn&#39;t know the answers to her own  <br/>
questions, really, although she probably thinks she does.<br/>
<br/>
I have never given my children marijuana, nor have I ever encouraged  <br/>
them.<br/>
I have never bought one of my boys a girly magazine, but when Kirby  <br/>
turned 18 his friends at work gave him a subscription to Penthouse.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what, about that:<br/>
<br/>
When I heard one of my kids had smoked dope, we talked about it  <br/>
(joked about it) and some stories were told that clarified some  <br/>
things, and some reminders were voiced about safety, legal risks and  <br/>
side issues, and that was that.<br/>
<br/>
What are my options?  Throw a fit?  &quot;Forbid&quot;?  Threaten?<br/>
<br/>
Kirby didn&#39;t always open the magazines right away.  Some were in his  <br/>
bathroom, in the cabinet.  Some were on a shelf.  When he moved, he  <br/>
didn&#39;t take them.<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby moved he had just been 21 for a month.  Someone had bought  <br/>
him a bottle of tequila for a birthday gift.  He never opened it.  It  <br/>
sat on the counter in the kitchen, and he didn&#39;t take it to Texas  <br/>
when he went.<br/>
<br/>
That is my experience with drugs and &quot;playboy&quot; at my house.  It&#39;s  <br/>
calm, it&#39;s open, it&#39;s honest, it&#39;s not an emergency, it&#39;s not a focus  <br/>
or a big deal.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t figure the list of an uptight Christian mom who&#39;s teaching  <br/>
Latin to small children was a good forum for issues I understand  <br/>
better than she does.   I think SHE would have thrown a fit,  <br/>
forbidden and threatened.  She did forbid, even without that.  I&#39;m  <br/>
not allowed to comment on her blog.<br/>
<br/>
That does not break my heart.  It doesn&#39;t even dent my happiness. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<time>16 May 2008, at  4:22pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1323409493">&lt;&lt;I was quoted in a report (a two-part essay for a writing assignment), <br/>
  and it&#39;s a good one, on video games.<br/>
<br/>
  Someone cited it on a Christian homeschooling mom&#39;s blog, and she <br/>
  went off, declared it &quot;horseshit,&quot; and naming people.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I started to read the mom&#39;s blog, but almost immediately felt sad and depressed so I stopped.  I&#39;ve never been involved much in discussions about video games because they&#39;re not an issue in our house.  They&#39;re available, there are no restrictions.  Sometimes my girls don&#39;t touch them for weeks; sometimes they&#39;re played daily for weeks; sometimes a few hours here and there.  My girls are not addicted, mindless video playing zombies.  They&#39;re happy, interesting, living, learning people who play video games whenever they choose.<br/>
<br/>
  However, I do know someone personally whose son would fit the mom&#39;s, from the above blog, description of kids who have no limits set on games/TV, etc.  It&#39;s my sister&#39;s boy, and I know this family very well.  He plays video games from the time he gets home from school until he falls asleep.  He talks video games constantly.  I&#39;ve never seen him indicate interest in anything else.  If a mom like the one above saw my nephew, she would point to him and say &quot;he proves my point&quot;.  But that&#39;s unfair.  Because there&#39;s so much more to it than just video games.  Video games are just one of many things that he could be devoting his time to.  But another huge element in this is parental involvement.  My sister is not involved in her son&#39;s life.  Since he started school she seems to feel that he should be able to entertain himself.  She doesn&#39;t provide anything else for him.  She&#39;s off doing her thing, and there he is - all alone.  And the games are there.  <br/>
<br/>
  It reminded me of conversation I had last year with a homeschooling mom.  She was complaining that she was constantly battling her kids over television, and then she asked me how I handled TV.  I told her we didn&#39;t have any restrictions on TV viewing.  She was shocked - I think because my girls didn&#39;t fit the mold she had in mind of what a child would be like with no restrictions.  Her first comment was that if she let her kids watch TV as much as they wanted to they would have Cartoon Network on from morning until night.  That reminded me of the time that my 10 yr old dd and I watched Green Acres all day on TV Land.  We drank hot choclate, snuggled on the couch and made pancakes for dinner in honor of Lisa Douglas.  So I related that story to my friend and told her how I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t miss that opportunity because of restrictions.  She said a day like that once in awhile is fine, but with her kids it would be every day.<br/>
<br/>
  That&#39;s when I start getting this ill feeling in my stomach.  Because it&#39;s said like an insult. As though her kids are too lazy or unmotivated to do anything else unless she tells them what to do.  I&#39;m not very good with choosing my words and tone of voice when in conversations like this, but I took a deep breath and gave it a shot.  I told her at first her kids might watch TV non-stop because they&#39;ve haven&#39;t been able to before but that it would probably not last.  That if it did, it would be because there wasn&#39;t anything better to do, and that it was her job as a mom to make her home an interesting and alive place to live.  I think she got a little irritated at that - my placing the responsibility on her but I went ahead to say how children often times don&#39;t have the means - money, ability to schedule activities, transportation, help with the details - to do many things they would like.  Just because a kid can read and write and tell you what they want, doesn&#39;t mean they can make it happen.  I don&#39;t know if she ever changed her rules about TV, but I guess she had something new to consider.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve since regretted I said &#39;something better to do&#39;, because I didn&#39;t mean that. That&#39;s ranking TV below other activities. Sometimes there is something better to do like going to the zoo, or fishing, or whatever, and sometimes watching TV is the better thing to do.<br/>
<br/>
  So that was all to say that I don&#39;t think it&#39;s just video games, but the whole homelife that plays a huge part in it.  Life needs to be interesting and alive and big and varied.  And from all that if they choose video games or TV, good.  But a lot of times mind choose other things, too.<br/>

Same experiences here.  My kids have complete access to their games, <br/>
but very seldom choose them.  <br/>
<br/>
This week (this being Friday night) they&#39;ve only played games one <br/>
day, and not even half of that day.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ve been outside bird watching, riding bikes, hunting &quot;treasure&quot; <br/>
with their Daddy and his metal detector, they&#39;ve watched some tv, <br/>
read some books, colored in some coloring books, drew pictures, wrote <br/>
stories, visited a friend and went out for pizza, played with the <br/>
animals, helped clean the house, worked on the landscaping for their <br/>
playhouse...there&#39;s probably more I&#39;m not thinking of.<br/>
<br/>
Since another *biggie* for people is the food thing (I noticed that <br/>
also came up in the comments on her blog) I&#39;ll go ahead and say we <br/>
went to a birthday party tonight and my kids didn&#39;t even have a piece <br/>
of birthday cake, but now that we&#39;re home my youngest is having chili <br/>
beans.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it *is* all anecdotal evidence.  Whatever.  We&#39;re happy.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-221821716">I don&#39;t know. Some days the television is on the cartoon channels much of the day. It doesn&#39;t mean they are watching it, but it is on. Right now Linnaea is watching The Suite Life of Zach and Cody, eating grapes and playing in a chair top that she&#39;s removed from it&#39;s legs, hard to describe. She dressed her 18 inch doll earlier as the excitement begins to overtake us at the idea of coming to the U.S. Simon has been watching Yugioh episodes on the laptop while playing a Yugioh game on his DS. So, the television may be on much of the time in our house, but it isn&#39;t always, often the main focus of the activity. Does that earn me 100.00 dollars (I only have £ on my keyboard, so I can&#39;t dollar sign it, without going through a much larger palaver than just blathering on).<br/>

First I would&#39;ve had to have started siphoning that money IN. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Albuquerque is in the U.S.  New Mexico is part of the U.S. (Some  <br/>

  Are you just doing Washington and Kansas and straight back home?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The business about getting tossed off the blog stuck in my head a  <br/>
while.  I understand asking a person to leave a party, but really,  <br/>
she DID use my name in some very negative ways up top there.   Then I  <br/>
thought of another reason that was bothering me.  The post was called  <br/>
&quot;From the Misguided Parent Files&quot; and that&#39;s irritating.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not &quot;misguided.&quot;  I&#39;m self-guided.  I&#39;ve had influences, but I&#39;ve  <br/>
picked through those influences, considered their ideas, tried them  <br/>
out, asked other people how things were going with their own quests.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps she feels &quot;guided.&quot;  Probably.  And so others must have been  <br/>
&quot;misguided.&quot;<br/>

Oh well...<br/>

<br/>
I have four children that play and one plays almost exclusively. That<br/>
IS his world, his passion and main interest. I think the problem with<br/>
parents like the blog author, is seeing a lot of video gaming as a<br/>
problem. I think it&#39;s what some people love more than anything and it<br/>
need not be demonized or put-down. Some people will turn that into a<br/>
career or find a different balance for themselves. I don&#39;t think<br/>
there&#39;s anything wrong with being VERY into video games.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if gamers were supported better, they wouldn&#39;t have to feel<br/>
badly about their love of gaming. They wouldn&#39;t get labeled &quot;addicted&quot;<br/>
and they might have better tools for making money at it! I just don&#39;t<br/>
think another human gets to decide what is &quot;too much&quot; time on gaming.<br/>
That&#39;s an individual thing.<br/>

I&#39;d agree with her. What&#39;s the problem with THAT?:)<br/>
I can say that cartoon network is on in my basement most of the day.<br/>
Jalen comes and goes from it and he&#39;s usually quite willing to go with<br/>
us on other activities. He likes more tv than most of us. Trevor likes<br/>
more video games than most of us. Is that wrong or bad? Nah.<br/>

I don&#39;t agree that unlimited access equals kids who don&#39;t care about a<br/>
thing. It does equal kids that get their fill though...and that&#39;s<br/>
always good in my book. Parents shouldn&#39;t release controls in order to<br/>
get a certain result though. They should release controls because it&#39;s<br/>
a lovely way to LIVE.:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1215056605">We are doing Oregon and Washington and maybe (if the car rental place allows it) a quick swing into Canada, then we are flying to Minnesota for a week (mom&#39;s in MN, grandma is in KS) then back to the UK. <br/>
<br/>
I now have a woman who I am not on speaking terms with. I&#39;ve never had that before. She started a conversation with me when she was in a bad mood about how her children would eat chocolate 24 hours a day if they let them. I said we probably shouldn&#39;t have this conversation. She decided it would be good and David joined in, but she took the greatest offense with me. So, she called me the next day saying she didn&#39;t want to be friends anymore and then went around or called around to the homeschooling group that we have the closest ties with and told everyone that I said she was an effin&#39; bad mother. So we aren&#39;t talking. I mean we say hello and all that, but nothing more. Her daughter and Linnaea are close friends, and fortunately she didn&#39;t decide to shut that off, although she said she was going to. I think her husband didn&#39;t let it go there. <br/>
<br/>
I still dwell on it. Actually, my sister in law won&#39;t talk to me anymore either, for much the same reason. I figure there is something irrascible about me that makes other people uncomfortable and even angry. What disturbed me most was having her tell all these other people, people whom I&#39;m not close friends with but who I interact with regularly, lies about me. I didn&#39;t talk about it with anyone, really. I figured it was a private fight. Also I felt really bad for upsetting her. I am the more capable debator, she was disadvantaged coming into the debate. <br/>
<br/>
You aren&#39;t misguided. I&#39;ve read through all of the discussion at her blog, well, skimmed some of the responses. I could write someone&#39;s ear off about human nature, David is just writing a paper on the marginal utility of food and children (Pam, he was so hoping you&#39;d be in Oregon, he just gave a talk on it at UEA and figures he can do an all theoretical paper instead of a data paper, there is a lot of evidence out there that children who have control over what they eat are less prone to bingeing, overeating, and not recognizing the feeling of being full, than children who are told what and when to eat), but that is all from an evolutionary understanding of humans, it isn&#39;t the most comfortable perspective to offer a group of people who want to look at children as being the bearers of Original Sin. Some people don&#39;t want to know that there are other ways of looking at children, at their charges, their chattel. If children can think and measure and make<br/>
 decisions without being limited and controlled and herded, than what was the point of all the misery. The people I find most defensive are the ones most invested. Often the children. I&#39;ve had discussions with kids who have to know that they cannot be as good or as smart or as successful if they don&#39;t go to school. Maybe your words made her to aware of how sandy her foundation is. <br/>

thought of another reason that was bothering me.  The post was called  <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m not &quot;misguided.&quot;  I&#39;m self-guided.  I&#39;ve had influences, but I&#39;ve  <br/>
picked through those influences, considered their ideas, tried them  <br/>

Perhaps she feels &quot;guided.&quot;  Probably.  And so others must have been  <br/>

Oh well...<br/>

I just read an interview with a family friend who had, it seems,<br/>
programmed and published a couple of Atari games when he was 17.  He<br/>
only made two before doing other work, but it was really interesting<br/>
to read about the path he took.  He definitely was not in an<br/>
unschooling family, but it seemed like an unschooly path to me.  The<br/>
interview was done for a book that someone wrote about early video<br/>
game makers and the whole thing seems to be online.  This is the link<br/>
to his interview.  You can easily navigate to the mail menu to see the<br/>
other interviews if you are interested.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-730844627">Schuyler,  I&#39;m really sorry the other mom in your group had a shut- <br/>
down reaction.  You warned her!<br/>
<br/>
On the list from which I&#39;m banned, I&#39;m being discussed by name and  <br/>
it&#39;s pretty irritating not to be able to defend myself at this point.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-Last year I spoke at a conference where Sandra was also speaking.  <br/>
In listening to her, both in her talks and as she chatted in the  <br/>
speakers lounge, it was very clear to me that there was little if any  <br/>
common ground in our views on education or, very probably, our life  <br/>
philosophies. (I would doubt she remembers me at all; I was the lone  <br/>
classical speaker at a conference dominated by unschoolers.)<br/>
<br/>
-=-In particular, I remember a talk she gave called something like  <br/>
“Iron Homeschooler” (I’m sure I’m getting that name wrong!). It was a  <br/>
play on Iron Chef: people in the audience would throw out a random  <br/>
word or phrase and Sandra would come up with a whole list of possible  <br/>
research topics to create a unit study. It was funny and apparently  <br/>
delighted the audience. But I remember thinking, okay, that’s  <br/>
amusing, but a smattering of research on “blue suede shoes” is not an  <br/>
education. It’s trivia.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I should defend myself on my blog.  I don&#39;t like to politicize  <br/>
blogs like that (not mine).  Darn it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Drew Campbell wrote that.  I followed a link.  I found a photo.  I  <br/>
don&#39;t recognize him.  He didn&#39;t say which conference.  He wrote this,  <br/>
too, which could also use a clarifying defense:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-For some people “unschooling” means that education is entirely,  <br/>
100% child-led - and that includes the learning of basic literacy and  <br/>
numeracy skills. Others gently guide their children in certain  <br/>
directions by “strewing” materials around the house; the parents are  <br/>
choosing the material, but the children are choosing whether or not  <br/>
to pick it up.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t use &quot;child led&quot; as a term or concept.  It&#39;s just too puny,  <br/>
it&#39;s too thin.  It&#39;s not about a relationship between the child and  <br/>
the family.<br/>
<br/>
But as to &quot;strewing,&quot; THAT, by God, is my term and concept, and I  <br/>
can&#39;t even go there and say so.<br/>
<br/>
So if anyone here wants to bandy some links about there in my  <br/>
defense,  the &quot;smattering of research&quot; was not &quot;research,&quot; it was the  <br/>
connections that can be made with and to ANYthing.<br/>

<br/>
All of the history of Catholicism is trivia if one doesn&#39;t believe in  <br/>
heaven, hell or the infallability of the pope.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s history, too, and I LOVE history, and I could go on for hours  <br/>
about the effect on culture of the Catholic church on six continents,  <br/>
and the protestant reformation, and its effect on things like the  <br/>
current U.S. Presidential race, and American Education, but unless  <br/>
it&#39;s going to be on a test, it&#39;s &quot;trivia.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But most of all, I have never, once, seen an episode of Iron Chef.  I  <br/>
don&#39;t have cable, and though I&#39;ve heard cook-friends hoot that it&#39;s  <br/>
fun, I don&#39;t even know how it works, so I couldn&#39;t have done anything  <br/>
as &quot;a play on Iron Chef.&quot;  What he&#39;s talking about was &quot;That&#39;s Not  <br/>
Educational,&quot; a game I&#39;ve played at a few conferences, and the first  <br/>
time was here:<br/>
<br/>
Home=Education, August 23-25, 1996, Sacramento, California<br/>
Words as Toys<br/>
&quot;That&#39;s Not Educational!&quot;<br/>
Unschooling with Abandon<br/>
Exploring the Middle Ages<br/>
<br/>
So 12 years later, in a place where I can&#39;t defend myself, someone  <br/>
else is explaining what I intended and what I believe and what I do?<br/>
Yeeks.  I think I&#39;ll go and work in the yard.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1740961780">I visited the barefoot meandering blog kinda strikes me as a funny for a Classical Homeschooler&#39;s blog -- isn&#39;t barefoot meandering a very unregulated activity? &lt;g&gt;  It may even be sinful! <br/>
   <br/>
  Anyway, here&#39;s my comment -- it&#39;s long and may not even appear I know (tho I think I was gentle and nice).<br/>
   <br/>
  *****<br/>
  I, too, came here from a link at Sandra Dodd&#39;s group. I read the gaming article, and Zach&#39;s essay, and Sandra&#39;s words, and all the other comments here. After all that reading, a couple of things occur to me.<br/>
   <br/>
  1. Steven Johnson, for all the disagreement many folks have for him here, is apparently successful enough to have published a book, right? So, maybe he knows something about something, even if it&#39;s only what will sell books. Not a complete and total failure, so maybe some of what he has to say has value. I&#39;m open-minded enough to believe I can&#39;t know until I actually read his words.<br/>
   <br/>
  2. I&#39;m very saddened by the parents who&#39;ve posted that they have one or a few children who can self-regulate, but another or two who can&#39;t. How sad for those children to know Mom thinks they can&#39;t self-regulate. I noticed that none of those Moms said &#39;yet&#39; about their child&#39;s perceived inability to self-regulate. Does this mean you believe this particular child will never learn to self-regulate? The s/he will always need someone one or something (limits imposed by society, or God, or parents or spouse?) to be regulated? Wow! I can&#39;t imagine truly believing one of my children will never learn to prioritize his life so that he can self-regulate. <br/>
   <br/>
  3. As to whether or not it&#39;s okay for Zach to purportedly tell parents how to treat their kids, and the later acknowledgement that maybe he was only talking to unschooling parents, maybe unschooling parents are the only kind he&#39;s known in his life? We are unschoolers, blessed to have a wonderful local community of unschoolers. I don&#39;t think my parents (oops, that should have read &#39;kids&#39;) actually see, up close, any non-unschooling parents. Sure, we know some, but my kids seem not to really notice them nor to internalize what those parents are about. Mainstream parents are something they see on TV, and they really don&#39;t give it much thought. <br/>
   <br/>
  4. Drew&#39;s bit about what people (children) must know or learn. I don&#39;t consider the Bible or Iliad to be essential, except in the context of how they do come up as what folks call trivia. Everyone has their own list, I suspect. For Muslims, it now doubt includes the Koran, for Jews the Talmud, for Communists writings of Lenin, and so on. Now, if we&#39;re talking must reads in my world, Atlas Shrugged tops the list -- but at 1000+ pages, it&#39;s not one any of my kids or even my husband have tackled. I don&#39;t even agree with Ayn Rand and I&#39;m certainly not an adherent of objectivism, but it&#39;s an amazing read, as is Stranger In A Strange Land by Heinlein, and even Secret Life of Bees, by Sue Monk Kidd. <br/>
   <br/>
  5. My experience of trivia (as one whose head is filled with trivia, admittedly) is that so much of what is dismissed as trivia is really an essential part of the rich tapestry of what it means to live in our world. It&#39;s kind of like my favorite Star Trek-Next Generation episode -- the one where Piccard lands on a planet where they speak only in metaphors and he knows no history of their culture so he can&#39;t communicate. Or in Blast from the Past, where Brendan Fraser walks out of a bomb shelter after 35 yrs totally clueless -- in his own country. Without a head full of trivia -- really comprehensive, contextual knowledge of what has come before -- how do people understand what&#39;s being presented today? Yeah, I&#39;m a history geek, with a crazy-glue memory, so I think the value of &#39;trivia&#39; is seriously under-rated. <br/>
   <br/>
  And for the record, I think folks were a little unfair to Sandra Dodd (who knows she can be irritating to some people!) whom I do know personally (guessing most folks here have never met or spoken with Sandra IRL). Then again, in my opinion (not irrefutable fact, just my opinion) many parents are unfair and unkind to their own beloved children (tho often very with the best of intentions -- kind of a benevolent malpractice, if you will) so why be surprised when they&#39;re unfair to a stranger?<br/>
   <br/>
  Sylvia -- realizing I may not even be posted here after that last remark, but I will copy this to Sandra&#39;s group for them to see!<br/>
   <br/>
   So there&#39;s my two cents worth on the latest villification of Sandra Dodd.<br/>
   <br/>

<br/>
I had two friends over for lunch yesterday; they&#39;re visiting from the<br/>
UK. He&#39;s a lifetime UK resident, she was raised in Czechoslovakia<br/>
under communist rule, and emigrated to the UK when she could. So,<br/>
their cultural context for things is completely different from ours.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t even remember what we were discussing; the internet, politics,<br/>
technology, something like that. And my friend, who is an ubergeek,<br/>
popped off with some factoid. His girlfriend said something about his<br/>
prodigious grasp of trivia, and he shot back with &quot;well, no, because<br/>
it&#39;s only trivia if it&#39;s never going to get you free alcohol at the<br/>
bar.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Which reminded me of the small Northern California town where I did my<br/>
undergrad degree. The botany professor had a deal with a local<br/>
barkeep, and he would give one free beverage-of-choice to anyone who<br/>
knew the correct term for the unrolling of a fern frond (circinate<br/>
vernation).<br/>
<br/>
So there you have it... a piece of information that can be used in<br/>
trade for a commodity. That makes it not trivia, yes? And yet how many<br/>
people live their entire lives happily unaware of it? Probably the<br/>
vast majority. It&#39;s certainly not curricula in any school I&#39;ve ever<br/>
been to, other than in this one professor&#39;s class. It wasn&#39;t even &quot;on<br/>
the test&quot; in any other class. It was just his thing. And here I am,<br/>
years later, and I still remember it. Because it had use for me, my<br/>
brain categorized it as &quot;useful&quot;. and kept it on the front burner. Go<br/>
figure.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; So 12 years later, in a place where I can&#39;t defend myself, someone<br/>
&gt; else is explaining what I intended and what I believe and what I do?<br/>
&gt; Yeeks.  I think I&#39;ll go and work in the yard.<br/>
<br/>
There is no thought control, and anyone who&#39;s going to believe what<br/>
someone says about a third party, unsubstantiated, isn&#39;t all that<br/>
concerned with intellectual rigor anyway.<br/>
<br/>
On the whole video gaming thing... it&#39;s so sad I don&#39;t even know where<br/>
to start. So I&#39;m not going to.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1954472969">I often ramble way away from my point. I think I probably did that in my reply. Sigh... I think it is okay to let other people talk about you without joining in. Those people who believe you are misguided, like Drew, the lone classical speaker (talk about a point of pride), aren&#39;t going to ever agree with how you represent yourself. Whereas those people who come over and see you being villified and get curious and wander over to Sandradodd.com and discover what you do represent, well, they get to make up their own minds. I think that was where I was going with my no-longer-friend who told everyone else what a baddy I was. I can&#39;t defend myself. If I do I make the fight go on and on and on. I don&#39;t gain anything and she gets the attention that she so craves. <br/>
<br/>
At least that&#39;s what I wanted to say. <br/>

Oh, and the fact that you were banned, talk about giving you the gift of martyrdom! Man excommunicated, very cool. <br/>

So if anyone here wants to bandy some links about there in my  <br/>
defense,  the &quot;smattering of research&quot; was not &quot;research,&quot; it was the  <br/>
connections that can be made with and to ANYthing.<br/>

<br/>
All of the history of Catholicism is trivia if one doesn&#39;t believe in  <br/>
heaven, hell or the infallability of the pope.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s history, too, and I LOVE history, and I could go on for hours  <br/>
about the effect on culture of the Catholic church on six continents,  <br/>
and the protestant reformation, and its effect on things like the  <br/>
current U.S. Presidential race, and American Education, but unless  <br/>
it&#39;s going to be on a test, it&#39;s &quot;trivia.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But most of all, I have never, once, seen an episode of Iron Chef.  I  <br/>
don&#39;t have cable, and though I&#39;ve heard cook-friends hoot that it&#39;s  <br/>
fun, I don&#39;t even know how it works, so I couldn&#39;t have done anything  <br/>
as &quot;a play on Iron Chef.&quot;  What he&#39;s talking about was &quot;That&#39;s Not  <br/>
Educational,&quot; a game I&#39;ve played at a few conferences, and the first  <br/>
time was here:<br/>
<br/>
Home=Education, August 23-25, 1996, Sacramento, California<br/>
Words as Toys<br/>
&quot;That&#39;s Not Educational!&quot;<br/>
Unschooling with Abandon<br/>
Exploring the Middle Ages<br/>
<br/>
So 12 years later, in a place where I can&#39;t defend myself, someone  <br/>
else is explaining what I intended and what I believe and what I do?<br/>
Yeeks.  I think I&#39;ll go and work in the yard.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-741431011">&lt;&lt;~~=-Her first comment was that if she let her kids watch TV as much as<br/>
  they wanted to they would have Cartoon Network on from morning until<br/>
  night. -=-~~<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;d agree with her. What&#39;s the problem with THAT?:)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t think I expressed myself clearly in that e-mail.  The mom that made the comment about having Cartoon Network on all day - what she meant is that her kids would turn into zombies watching Cartoon Network from morning tilll night.  You know, their eyes would turn square or whatever that book was about.<br/>
<br/>
  My point to her was to ask if there were other interesting, creative things going on in her home for her children to choose from.  And was she helping her kids make things happen that they couldn&#39;t do by themselves.<br/>
<br/>
  What I realized later, and unfortunately did not express well to that other mom, was if there were other exciting, interesting, big things going on, and her child still chose to watch TV or play games then that&#39;s where we need to trust that that&#39;s the better choice for that child at that time.<br/>
<br/>
  Also, and this is my own children since I know them well, never throw a fit if I ask them to stop -TV or games or whatever - so we can go somewhere or if something came up.  I believe this is because they know they can continue with it later.  It&#39;s available.<br/>
<br/>
  The TV is always on in my house.  That doesn&#39;t mean my girls are always watching it.  They will plop on a couch for a while, and then get up to do something else.  Right now the Disney Channel is on, one is sort of watching while looking at an American Girl catalog, another is buried deep in a Charlie Bone book, and the other two are outside picking up rocks while dad rototills.  That&#39;s pretty normal.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-494568728">-=-What I was trying to say was they *do* find other things to do, it&#39;s<br/>
not just games all the time, which is what people worry about when<br/>
they&#39;re starting to think of taking off restrictions (or trying to<br/>
come up with a reason NOT to take off restrictions). -=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Once upon a time, we were being measured in our TV viewing, not by  <br/>
ME, but by an outside agency about which we&#39;re not supposed to speak,  <br/>
but y&#39;know.... ratings.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I said right up front, when we were solicited to participate, that we  <br/>
let our kids watch what they want, and we might not be a good sample  <br/>
to represent our area.  No, no, no, said someone who told me never to  <br/>
tell we talked.  (HOW on earth can a person such as myself, so prone  <br/>
to telling stories, have been stuck with a secret like that AND then  <br/>
have a kid who&#39;s got a secret job!??   It pains me...)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So twice I got long distance calls from a distant place asking me to  <br/>
go and turn on a television (two different ones, once) so they could  <br/>
see if their monitoring equipment was operational, because their  <br/>
records indicated the television had not been watched for a full month.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have cable, as I&#39;ve said.  We can see huge transmitters out  <br/>
the window.  (They look small, because they&#39;re on the top of a mile- <br/>
high mountain, but we&#39;ve seen them up close; huge.)  We had at that  <br/>
time five or six operational televisions, and most hooked up to video  <br/>
games and players of one thing or another.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I **told** them we let the kids watch whenever they want.  How could  <br/>
anyone be surprised that some months, on some equipment,  it was zero??<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And lately, Holly and I watch more movies and TV on our computers  <br/>
than sitting in a soft chair looking across the room at a box.<br/>

<br/>
My older son had all the behaviors of a kid addicted to video games <br/>
from about the age of 13-16. He was also coming from a place of having <br/>
them limited. Once I let go of that and decided to just let him do <br/>
what he wanted, he got really interested in other things. Most of the <br/>
time he was out with his friends skateboarding, rehearsing with his <br/>
band, going to the beach, hanging out, teenage stuff. The only time he <br/>
played video games after that was when there wasn&#39;t anything else to <br/>
do.<br/>
<br/>
My 4yo likes to have the TV on whenever he&#39;s in the house. However, <br/>
he&#39;s almost always willing to turn it off to go somewhere with us or <br/>
play outside with a friend or help me in the kitchen. He can and does <br/>
walk away whenever he wants. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1246017558">== I now have a woman who I am not on speaking terms with. I&#39;ve <br/>
never had that before.==<br/>
==Her daughter and Linnaea are close friends, and fortunately she <br/>
didn&#39;t decide to shut that off, although she said she was going to.  <br/>
==<br/>
<br/>
I usually lurk inconsistently on this list.  This post from Schuyler <br/>
struck a cord with me.  I had a similar situation happen this past <br/>
year. A woman who was a good friend got upset with me about <br/>
something that I wrote in an e-mail to her.  It was not something <br/>
that I wrote in anger or frustration, and I did not expect it to <br/>
create animosity or anger in response.  Apparently, it did.  I did <br/>
not find out for a long time, because the *friend* did not respond <br/>
or communicate with me about her interpretation of what I had <br/>
written.  She spread word among our mutual friends in our homeschool <br/>
group that she was angry and was not going to send or receive e-<br/>
mails from me anymore, or talk to me anymore.  We were not in the <br/>
habit of talking on a daily basis, so I did not catch on until she <br/>
did not follow through on a scheduled play date for our daughters <br/>
(some time after the e-mail that apparently offended.)  At that <br/>
time, I found it odd that I could not reach the *friend* to confirm <br/>
and solidify the plans for the playdate.  In mentioning the <br/>
situation to a mutual friend, I was told that the other woman was <br/>
angry with me.  Sigh.<br/>
<br/>
I wish my 11yo daughter and her friend were as fortunate as Linnaea <br/>
and her friend.  In my case, my *friend*&#39;s children and my children <br/>
(we each have a dd and a ds) had been friends.  When the mother cut <br/>
off communication with me, she included my children.  It&#39;s <br/>
unfortuate, because it also affects her own children and other <br/>
children in our homeschool community.<br/>
<br/>
Like Schuyler, I felt bad for offending the person.  Once I realized <br/>
that my words had that unintended affect, I apologized the next time <br/>
that I saw the offended *friend* in person.  I explained that I had <br/>
not intended to hurt her and was sorry for that.  She accepted my <br/>
apology but said that she was not ready to talk about it.  I offered <br/>
to meet some time to talk further as soon as she was ready.  That <br/>
has never happened.<br/>
<br/>
In my case, this woman was also my dd&#39;s girl scout leader.  In <br/>
deciding not to communicate with me, she quit including us in her <br/>
communications regarding the girl scout events and meetings, even <br/>
after I tried to make amends.  Throughout the past year, she has <br/>
planned group events that my children are not included in.  Her <br/>
children are still invited to things that my family plans, but they <br/>
do not attend, though the four children still get along very well on <br/>
the rare occasions that they are together in group gatherings.  I <br/>
have had two other occasions where I have tried to reach out to this <br/>
other parent, once to wish her a happy birthday, and another time to <br/>
send simple good wishes to her and her family.  Part of me was <br/>
hoping that she would *come to her senses* and stop behaving in such <br/>
an inappropriate way.  That has not happened.<br/>
<br/>
It is all so very unfortunate when a parent acts out in anger, <br/>
especially when children become casualty of the behavior.  In <br/>
reading Schuyler&#39;s comments, I wonder if this kind of thing is not <br/>
too unusual?  It caught me off-guard; I&#39;m not used to this kind of <br/>
behavior and personally don&#39;t believe in treating people in this way.<br/>
<br/>
== I figure there is something irrascible about me that makes other <br/>
people uncomfortable and even angry. ==<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s it for me, as well! :-)  I have to say that in both <br/>
cases, it sounds like the other person involved was the irascible <br/>
one!<br/>
<br/>
Is this kind of thing more common than I realize?  How have other <br/>
parents dealt with it?  In our case, it affects our unschooling in <br/>
that it affects the group of friends who have the shared life <br/>
philosophy of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, it has been a lesson in social dynamics.  My dd <br/>
became involved  in the discussion because we needed to decide what <br/>
to do about girl scouts.  Since it was her activity, it needed to be <br/>
her decision. Also, the obvious change in friendship and hearing <br/>
about activities that she and her brother were not invited to has <br/>
led to further discussions. Over the year as the situation has <br/>
progressed, we have had many conversations about human behavior - <br/>
kind of a natuaral lesson in psychology/sociology lesson.  She has <br/>
expressed to me that she is amazed that an adult would behave in <br/>
such a way.  If she were in school, she would likely be dealing with <br/>
social dynamics, too; these kinds of things often happen in groups <br/>
of girls in school, but as an unschooler she sees it with an adult, <br/>
not among children.<br/>
<br/>
Is this a common phenomenon, either in adult groups or due to the <br/>
lifestyle that we live?  Has anyone else dealt with a similar <br/>
situation?  I guess I&#39;m wondering if anyone has any insights to <br/>
share with me.<br/>
<br/>
thanks in advance,<br/>
