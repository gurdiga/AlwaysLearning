<div id="ygrps-yiv-1865869725">Thank you for the kind words, Lori.<br/>
I’m glad sukaynalabboun responded, or I might have missed it.  This group IS too quiet! :-)  (And I have pneumonia and am slow to think, this week.)<br/>
<br/>
I like the response about conversations and being increasingly able to read one’s children.  <br/>
<br/>
Here’s the post Lori’s asking about:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com/2018/05/moonrise.html">http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com/2018/05/moonrise.html</a><br/>
<br/>
She quoted the text, but I’m happier when the image and text can stay together.<br/>
<br/>
I wrote it, and it serves me right to be called to explain it.  It’s not as parallel as I imagined it to be.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Sometimes it&#39;s good to see cause and effect, connections, relationships.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Other times, it might be best to gaze without speaking.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sometimes it’s fun to say “Oh wow, the reflection of the moon is so cool, and that reminds me of a photo Ashlee sent of Ivan and a mirror, and…”<br/>
<br/>
Connections are the best part of learning, in unschooling, in life, for fun.  But if it’s too noisy too often, a quiet moonrise over a lake will get all sound-polluted.  And one person’s thoughts of beauty might be overrun by someone else’s free associations.<br/>
<br/>
I just had a thought that will probably end up in Just Add Light, too. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I’ve said that conversations, friendships, relationships, are like a chess game.  You don’t get to plan out all the moves in advance and decide the end.  You get to make ONE move.  Then you wait.  It’s a pretty good analogy, and has helped my kids sometimes when they were frustrated with lack of control or influence in a difficult situation.  But here’s where the chess analogy is NOT good:<br/>
<br/>
Moon is rising.  The night is cool,  You’re sitting quietly in a place that was dark and now is lighting up.  You say…<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Look at the clouds.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It’s like moving a pawn out.<br/>
<br/>
The other person might just say “hmmmm.” and indicate by that “I heard you, and I have nothing to add to that.  I’m looking.”<br/>
<br/>
If it’s chess, it should be played out to the end. :-)  But no one has a right to have the whole game/conversation played out.  (Unless it’s a tournament, or you’ve paid for 50 minutes of talk therapy…  none of my analogies are holding still!!)<br/>
<br/>
So make a move.<br/>
Wait.<br/>
Maybe the other person really wants to talk about clouds and weather and mystery and fairy tale, airliners and contrails and paranoid theories and North Korea.  Maybe really truly NOT.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I have moments of such ease and flow, sharing something relevant with my child and then pausing to see if my child is interested or engaged before I share any more of my own observations or follow my child&#39;s lead of further inquiry (or not).-=-<br/>
<br/>
That sounds perfect.<br/>
<br/>
No human in all the history of the world has, or could have guessed right every time, about what to say, how much to say, how quickly, in what tone…  <br/>
Most humans can get a bit better at it, as time goes one. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I still say too much or too little with/to my husband, ofter knowing him for 40 years.  It happened half an hour ago.  Quick, it passed, but it happens. :-)<br/>
<br/>
-=-I would appreciate any links or ideas to support me get more familiar and confident with this ease of knowing when to say something and when not to.<br/>
<br/>
-=-To clarify, I&#39;m more likely to go with the latter (gaze and enjoy the moment and trust my child to ask questions or make their own connections) but I do want to get more comfortable with sharing my own observations without feeling like that would be interfering or taking away from the moment or my child&#39;s natural learning process.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Conversations with a parent are natural learning fodder.   Natural learning doesn’t happen in a vacuum or in isolation.  Those things aren’t so natural. :-)<br/>
<br/>
In my experience, unschooling parents are more likely to say too much than not enough.<br/>
<br/>
The best link I think I have about natural discussions with children is “Leaning on a Truck and other parallel play”<br/>
The URL is easy to remember.   /truck<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/truck">http://sandradodd.com/truck</a><br/>
<br/>
Oh.  The title is <br/>
<br/>
Doing Two Things at Once<br/>
or, Leaning on a Truck and other parallel play<br/>
<br/>
Y’SEE how people can throw too many words at something!?  Sheeeesh.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-388796565">To make up for having missed Lori’s question for a few days, I have more links to bring. :-)<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com/search?q=quiet">http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com/search?q=quiet</a><br/>
<br/>
This goes to a search for “Quiet” at Just Add Light and Stir.  Each of those will go to something, somewhere, on my site.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to list the names of the posts that came up, though.  Just reading the titles might be a bit soothing:<br/>
<br/>
Quiet<br/>
Quiet time for parents<br/>
Quiet enough to hear<br/>
A long, quiet time<br/>
Quite quiet<br/>
Talking less<br/>
Quiet antiques<br/>
Quiet reflection<br/>
A quiet, soft place<br/>
Calm and Quiet<br/>
<br/>
(I left out a few that didn’t have “quiet” in the title, but only in the text.  One is called “Thrashing and flailing.” )<br/>
<br/>
I think it means not to feel guilty about not talking too much.<br/>
