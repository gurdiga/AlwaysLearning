<br/>
&gt;&gt;There is an email from Cottonwood Farm in my inbox waiting to be<br/>
&gt;&gt;opened.  How does this virus work?<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m pretty sure attachments are stripped off posts to this list.  No<br/>
&gt;attachment - no virus.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I also got the email from Cottonwood Farm, with an attachment. It didn&#39;t<br/>
come through the list. The virus apparently caused itself to be<br/>
automatically sent to addresses on the &quot;sender&#39;s&quot; computer. Before we got an<br/>
anti-virus program we got that same virus, and it autimatically sent itself<br/>
to every email address listed anywhere on our computer, not just in the<br/>
address book. A friend of ours told us how to get rid of it, but that email<br/>
was saved on our old computer, not this one. I am sure that you could find<br/>
out on the symatec website. This time our anti-virus caught it immediately<br/>
and quarantined it!<br/>
<br/>
I no longer open attachments that I am not expecting, or that the sender<br/>
doesn&#39;t include a message telling me that they are sending the attachment<br/>
and what it is for. All but one of the viruses that we got on our old<br/>
computer were unwittingly sent by people we knew (or at least by their<br/>
computers). So only opening attachments from people you know is not safe. If<br/>
I get an attachment from someone I know, I will email them back and ask them<br/>
about it before opening it. If it is from someone I don&#39;t know, I just<br/>
delete the message - attachment and all - without opening it.<br/>
