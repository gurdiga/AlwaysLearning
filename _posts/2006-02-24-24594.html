<div id="ygrps-yiv-1821306985">Hi all,<br/>
 <br/>
I wanted to formally introduce myself as I have been lurking around for a  <br/>
bit :)  I have 5 children ranging from almost 13 to 4 in ages.  I  recognize <br/>
several posters on this list from a previous list I was on, and am  thrilled that <br/>
I have found my way back to the people who have contributed much  to my <br/>
parental style and our overall lifestyle changes!  We are in Georgia,  and have <br/>
found our way to unschooling after much reading, soul searching,  deschooling and <br/>
rethinking.  We have a ways to go on our journey, but we  are enjoying the <br/>
trip now!<br/>
 <br/>
I have a comment and a question.  The comment is about the mopping  posts <br/>
I&#39;ve been seeing - they made me laugh out loud!  I do very little  mopping, <br/>
because I hate it.  Lucky for me, after my 5 year  old daughter and her friend next <br/>
door watched Little Orphan Annie, the activity  of choice has been getting <br/>
these huge sponges wet and singing &quot;It&#39;s a Hard Knock  Life&quot; or whatever that <br/>
song is, and zooming across the floor.  They have  been doing it for a couple of <br/>
months now whenever her friend is over and I have  to say my floors haven&#39;t <br/>
been this clean in ages :)<br/>
 <br/>
My question is this:  my two youngest are a 4yo boy and a 5yo  girl.  Next up <br/>
the line is my 7yo son.  These three seem to fight with  each other almost <br/>
nonstop, and go to great lengths to annoy the heck out of each  other.  They <br/>
argue over everything, it seems - and my daughter especially  gets very upset and <br/>
loud when they argue.  My 7yo is more of the quietly  annoy and look innocent <br/>
type :)  My 4yo seems to have some violent  tendencies - he doesn&#39;t hit or <br/>
kick people or anything, but he constantly says  things like &quot;and then, I cut <br/>
your head off,&quot; or &quot;you&#39;re dead now,&quot; or &quot;I chop  off your arms and legs,&quot; <br/>
sometimes calling people stupid, grabbing items out of  other&#39;s hands and things of <br/>
that nature.  Some of his behavior is rude, and  some of it just makes other <br/>
kids that don&#39;t know him well uncomfortable.   He has been crazy for Lord of <br/>
the Rings ever since it came out, so most of his  life.  He adores anything <br/>
that deals with swords, guns, martial arts,  etc.  I worry because he seems so <br/>
young and he is a real sweetie, very  loving and adores his older siblings, but <br/>
he plays rough and acts mean  sometimes.  He constantly repeats lines he hears <br/>
in movies and acts out  scenes he found particularly interesting (I wish I <br/>
had a dollar for every time  he yelled &quot;You..shall not...pass!&quot; like Gandalf!).  <br/>
So far we do a lot of  talking about respecting other people&#39;s personal space <br/>
and property, and  reminding that we should ask before using someone else&#39;s  <br/>
toy/scooter/whatever.  Most of the items in our house are community  property, <br/>
but there are a few things that my 7yo has bought that he doesn&#39;t  want the <br/>
&quot;little kids&quot; to mess with.  I have asked them to tell  each other what they <br/>
want, etc.  It just doesn&#39;t seem to be working.   I&#39;m kind of at a loss as my <br/>
oldest (twins) are pretty laid back and there are 5  years between them and my <br/>
7yo, so there wasn&#39;t any sort of &quot;sibling rivalry&quot; or  anything like that when <br/>
my oldest were little.  I keep thinking that maybe  Daniel (the 4yo) feels <br/>
powerless somehow, or is just trying to be older, or  something, but frankly I <br/>
don&#39;t know what else to do.  Any  suggestions/thoughts would be appreciated!<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>

before the fights start.  My #1 was 5 and a half when #3 was born, so  <br/>
I came through the crowded years too, and in a very small house.<br/>
<br/>
Second thing, I wrote this out once and someone saved it and gave it  <br/>
back when others asked. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

This has worked well for us, and some others have reported that it  <br/>
helped them too.<br/>

Was it here that there was a discussion of safety just the other  <br/>
day?  (If not, where, please?)<br/>
<br/>
Kids  need to feel safe in their homes.  Guests do.  Moms do.  NO  <br/>
one, not maniacs or burglars or four year old residents, has the  <br/>
right to disturb the peace or terrorize people in your home.<br/>
<br/>
I recommend karate classes, and maybe more violent movies (kid-style,  <br/>
maybe).  If he&#39;s having fantasies of violence, go with it instead of  <br/>
against it.  It might play out.  He might be more specific about what  <br/>
he&#39;s thinking about, considering, examining in his mind.<br/>
