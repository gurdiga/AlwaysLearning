<div id="ygrps-yiv-14667698">In discussing the singing of the lady in England who so impressed the  <br/>
Britain Has Talent (or whatever show it is) judges, someone in a chat  <br/>
asked what her voice was like and I said it was strong and clear.  She  <br/>
asked what &quot;clear&quot; was, with singing.   I had left the chat, but wrote  <br/>
later and said sorry I had missed the question and offered to try to  <br/>
describe it.<br/>
=======================<br/>
<br/>
-=-Sure! I&#39;m curious.   When a signer is clear, their fingers form each<br/>
letter and handshape cleanly, in a visually pleasing way.  I&#39;m<br/>
guessing that&#39;s what a clear voice is like as well?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe art is a better analogy.   Sometimes people sketch with a pencil  <br/>
or with paints so that they&#39;ve made lots of short lines that end up  <br/>
being the shape of something, but some people can make one very bold,  <br/>
sharp line without hesitation and there&#39;s no waver in it.  It looks  <br/>
exactly like what it&#39;s supposed to look like.<br/>
<br/>
And related to that, in zen paintings (Chinese brush paintings), there  <br/>
are solid dark lines, and more watery lines, more grey.<br/>
<br/>
With singing voices, someone can be right on a pitch and stay there-- <br/>
not slide up to it, or down to it from another note, but it it exactly  <br/>
where it is without hesitation and then stay there, with a clear  <br/>
difference between the silence and that note, as with a black ink line  <br/>
where the edge of the ink is separate from the white of the paper.<br/>
<br/>
There are other kinds of singing voices and styles where people  <br/>
purposely make their voice raspy so the tone is &quot;wide&quot;--not always at  <br/>
the vibration of the note they&#39;re representing, so it&#39;s more like  <br/>
sketching that note, or shading it, or using the watery ink.   The  <br/>
difference between note and not-note isn&#39;t as precise or surprising  <br/>
(surprising isn&#39;t the word; stark? but stark sounds uncomfortable...)<br/>
<br/>
People say &quot;clear as a bell&quot; sometimes, but a clear singing voice is  <br/>
way more clear than a bell.  Bells have after-tones and overtones...  <br/>
very messy, physically (meaning the physics of the vibration of the  <br/>
tone).<br/>
<br/>
I sing, but I&#39;m not a singing coach, so I&#39;m probably missing some  <br/>
aspect of terminology here.  I&#39;m going to run this by the Always  <br/>
Learning list for clarification....<br/>
<br/>
Sandra<br/>
=============================<br/>
<br/>
As I was writing, I realized how accustomed I am now to having other  <br/>
people read what I&#39;m trying to say and to suggest better descriptions  <br/>
or phrases.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe someone can describe it in terms of physics and the &quot;width&quot; of  <br/>
the range of vibrations that keep it on the right note.  I don&#39;t much  <br/>
love vibrato, but even with vibrato it needs to average out to the  <br/>
right pitch.<br/>
<br/>
Can you think of other ways to describe a clear singing voice?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1356165509">Roxana says if you&#39;re talking about vocal quality - it has to do with <br/>
the placement (where the resonance is mainly taking place in the head of <br/>
the singer) not back in the throat so that it is raspy or throaty or <br/>
muddy and not forward so far that it is nasal. But more forward than back.<br/>

Hmmm (la la LA la   la).... some apparently general singing advice <br/>
which sounds surprisingly like great ways to do well in deschooling and <br/>
unschooling (I see unschooling in probably more things these days, <br/>
really!).  I thought it was interesting:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/cy42se">http://tinyurl.com/cy42se</a><br/>
<br/>
Some excerpts:<br/>
<br/>
Breathe<br/>
<br/>
Listen<br/>
If you can’t hear the note in your head, there is no way for your voice <br/>
to produce it.  [...] Each individual must find their own path to their <br/>
note in their own way.<br/>
<br/>
Warm Up<br/>
<br/>
Get out of your own way<br/>
There is no forcing this process; it has to be natural. Don’t make your <br/>
voice do anything it doesn’t want to do. “Trying too hard and <br/>
anticipating everything too much makes you tighten up—like when you <br/>
know you are about to get into a car wreck. Go with the flow.” Use a <br/>
mirror to see if you are “scrunching up your face or reaching for notes <br/>
with your head or chin.” Focus on the meaning of the words that you are <br/>
singing, so the song projects the natural emotions of the lyric.<br/>

<br/>
I did. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-In my opinion, Susan Boyle&#39;s voice sounds like clear water running  <br/>

<br/>
But compared to what, as voices go?  You mean sounds like clear water  <br/>
looks?   Because muddy water sounds the same.<br/>
<br/>
I was trying to describe the remarkability of an exceptionally clear  <br/>
singing voice, and I think it has to do with contrast and an  <br/>
unwavering pitch.   So describing the idea that some people&#39;s tones  <br/>
are &quot;broad...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ah.   Maybe going back to the physical reality of a tone--the fact  <br/>
that it&#39;s a particular vibration (or not) could apply to color.   Even  <br/>
in nature.   Some leaves or flowers are colored several different  <br/>
shades and it all averages out to &quot;green&quot; or &quot;pink,&quot; but some are  <br/>
truly one solid color throughout.<br/>
<br/>
And there are flowers and leaves that are pretty because of the  <br/>
variations and curly edges and various colors, and people might like  <br/>
the singer&#39;s voice because of an ability to do vibrato or voice breaks  <br/>
or trills or ornamental things.  Susan Boyle wasn&#39;t that kind of  <br/>
singer.  Whitney Houston is.<br/>
<br/>
With wind instruments (flute, recorder, sax, clarinet) there are  <br/>
techniques involving purposely not making a clear tone, or sliding up  <br/>
or down to a note a little bit with air pressure or the position of  <br/>
the mouth.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes a musician is inexperienced or untalented and so does such  <br/>
things by accident, and that&#39;s just a muddly mess.<br/>
<br/>
Susan Boyle was no mess, no frills, and really good.<br/>

A clear singing voice is like running my hand on a smooth piece of cool glass and sometimes, when the voice warbles or has vibrato, the glass gets long, undulating rolls in it like a slide.

<br/>
I&#39;m forwarding these to the person who asked.  This one was my favorite.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So while we&#39;re on the topic of using words to convey ideas about  <br/>
things another person can&#39;t perceive in the way the writer does, are  <br/>
there things already written about how blind people think of or  <br/>
perceive color, or how people have described it to them?<br/>
<br/>
My mom had a blind friend who could tell colors by touch pretty well.   <br/>
He said there was a vibration.  I don&#39;t doubt it.  And I know  <br/>
sometimes deaf people can touch an instrument or sit where an organ is  <br/>
making the floor vibrate, and perceive things about music that hearing  <br/>
people probably have no idea about.<br/>
<br/>
If there are things Helen Keller wrote about these things, I&#39;d be  <br/>
willing to go there and read.  This discussion has intrigued me.<br/>
<br/>
I knew a woman who had no sense of taste or smell, and she chose her  <br/>
foods by texture (by what she thought she needed nutritionally and  <br/>
digestively first, but as to preferences it was texture).<br/>

<br/>
Thinking of Howard Gardner&#39;s intelligences, is the ability to sign  <br/>
beautifully more a kinesthetic thing (bodily intelligence, like  <br/>
dancing or sports) or is it something else?   Would it be like a  <br/>
musical intelligence thing, the aesthetics of rhythm and line (melody,  <br/>
for hearing, but there must be something aesthetic about graceful  <br/>
proportions even outside of music--I see it in tile jobs and walls and  <br/>
fences sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
When a hearing person signs well, is that more linguistic intelligence  <br/>
or kinesthetic or a combination of both?<br/>
<br/>
When someone doesn&#39;t play soccer well, will their signing maybe be  <br/>
wooden or awkward as well?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1788468789">For a person who can see (and by that I don&#39;t mean can see *well* ... <br/>
just can see), color could impress on closed eyes in strong sunlight.  <br/>
I used to feel a lot of color contrast in the light with my eyes closed <br/>
while riding in the car as a child.  Now not so much but I still see <br/>
them.  The colors move like waves .... I&#39;ve always wondered if the <br/>
colors I&#39;m seeing are the actual color group of the light I&#39;m in.    <br/>
I&#39;ve never heard anybody else talk about that but then again, I&#39;m very <br/>
interested in color anyway so I think I notice color in light just <br/>
because I love color.<br/>
<br/>
Also... this whole thing connects with the thread about physiology, <br/>
health and an instinctive need for motion.  The above color waving in <br/>
light experience is probably one of the major ways I fed that need.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1314347975">I think it depends on the comfort level with the activity.  If soccer <br/>
bothers a person somehow no matter how much that person wants to play, <br/>
unease will show.  The same with expressing ourselves in other ways.<br/>

<br/>
There are actual regional accents in signing, like there are in voiced <br/>
speaking.<br/>
<br/>
There is slang. There is development of new words over time.<br/>
<br/>
And - there are &quot;speech impediments&quot; - sort of like articulation <br/>
problems like lisps, I guess. I know someone who has an inflexible <br/>
finger - that hampers her signing.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m forwarding these to the person who asked.  This one was my  <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So while we&#39;re on the topic of using words to convey ideas about<br/>
&gt; things another person can&#39;t perceive in the way the writer does, are<br/>
&gt; there things already written about how blind people think of or<br/>
&gt; perceive color, or how people have described it to them?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My mom had a blind friend who could tell colors by touch pretty well.<br/>
&gt; He said there was a vibration.  I don&#39;t doubt it.  And I know<br/>
&gt; sometimes deaf people can touch an instrument or sit where an organ is<br/>
&gt; making the floor vibrate, and perceive things about music that hearing<br/>
&gt; people probably have no idea about.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If there are things Helen Keller wrote about these things, I&#39;d be<br/>
&gt; willing to go there and read.  This discussion has intrigued me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I knew a woman who had no sense of taste or smell, and she chose her<br/>

&gt; digestively first, but as to preferences it was texture).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-628519549">This is the first time I&#39;ve posted to an unschooling site, although I have been silently lurking in the shadows for months (and, for maybe the first time in my life, keeping my mouth shut).<br/>
<br/>
The changes in our lives already are amazing, although there are still &quot;hot spots&quot; in my acceptance of Jeremiah (7.5) and Annalise (4.75) exactly as they are, in this moment.  I&#39;m breathing - a lot!<br/>
<br/>
This thread interested me because I have been dealing with a very similar issue in a fantasy story I&#39;ve been working on for my own amusement.  There are shapeshifting humanoid/felinoids, a technology based on a symbiosis between people and plants, and several differing methods of sensing environments.  Explaining this in the prose has been a simple matter compared to opening my own mind to how these beings must be perceiving their realities....<br/>
<br/>
Sort of like our journey into mindful parenting...?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thank you all so much for being here, for having not only answers, but also attitudes and stories that prove to me that not only is this way of life possible, it&#39;s natural and rich, filled with moments of grace that sneak in at the edges of things (often at 4:30 am around here!).  I konw you&#39;ve all heard this before, but you have helped the Burton family become more joyous and peaceful!<br/>
<br/>
Peace! =)<br/>
