<div id="ygrps-yiv-765867741">I&#39;ve never posted here before, so I hope you won&#39;t mind if I ask you <br/>
all a question.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, I have 3 children - oldest is only 5.  I think my kids <br/>
have perfectly fine social skills for their age, but we don&#39;t <br/>
socialize as often as most people.  My kids are actually quite <br/>
outgoing, but prefer to visit with only a couple of kids at a time.  <br/>
This seems quite acceptable to me - I feel the same way myself and I <br/>
consider this quite normal.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, we haven&#39;t cultivated a whole lot of friends to date.  <br/>
My daughter has one best friend and one friend she just tolerates.  I <br/>
always leave it up to her whether or not to continue the latter <br/>
friendship, of course.  I am good friends with both mothers.  We have <br/>
opportunities to make other friends through the local homeschool <br/>
group but,(and here&#39;s the kicker) I&#39;m just too tired lately to get <br/>
out much with the kids, or to have anyone over to our house.  Isn&#39;t <br/>
that sad!?!<br/>
<br/>
My question is--do you think my kids can survive this isolation for <br/>
another year or so?  My two oldest play wonderfully together, so I&#39;m <br/>
hoping that will be good enough until my youngest finally lets me <br/>
sleep through the night.  I&#39;d just be happy to hear from anyone who <br/>
has been through a similar stage.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1101252276">Hi Renee,<br/>
<br/>
I was in a similar position with 3 kids 5 and under, the littlest was <br/>
newborn... I tried to do too much and ended up resenting everything, <br/>
even the fun stuff we picked ourselves... there was not enough of me to <br/>
go around outside of surviving... when I look back at the past 3 years, <br/>
I see that we are doing less each year, but it is more meaningful... <br/>
each person in our group gets to say how we feel and how important the <br/>
activity seems, then we kind of compromise and take turns giving in... <br/>
it seems to work with verbal kids, but not babies and toddlers... my <br/>
ideas about myself and what I need to do are close to the ground, it&#39;s <br/>
realistic, but it has been very difficult for me to change, basically <br/>
we came screeching to a grinding halt last year and I spent much time <br/>
thinking, and not talking about what I think/ want, it was good for <br/>
me... I like us better when I am sane...<br/>
<br/>
Jules.<br/>
<br/>
ps, we don&#39;t have many kid friends, one or two per sibling like you... <br/>
more grown ups are in our favorite people group... the friends we <br/>
started with all went to school, and the homeschool group are not for <br/>
us for various reasons... we meet a lot of kids at the beach, at the <br/>
park, at the library, in after school classes and in community rec <br/>
sports...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I had four children with the oldest being five ten years ago, and we didn&#39;t<br/>
do much of anything outside our home. When we did it was a walk to the park,<br/>
or the corner store, and that usually was the limit of what we all wanted to<br/>
do in a day together (picture: one mom, three toddlers, one baby...the<br/>
navigation alone was an event!). At home, there was constant activity, and I<br/>
have no memory of even a moment that anyone seemed to need anything more<br/>
socially than what we had going on. Are your children acting like or saying<br/>
they want something more socially?<br/>
<br/>
Socializing outside our family seemed to come more when the children were<br/>
better able to plan. They&#39;d ask me in the park to write someone&#39;s phone<br/>
number down and we&#39;d call to arrange a play date, or they would ask<br/>
specifically to get together with a family that had kids they gelled with.<br/>
There were a couple of moms I liked and would put some effort into getting<br/>
us all together. But my memories of the period of time that you are talking<br/>
about are mostly at home, keeping everyone safe and happy, delighting in the<br/>
things they came up with (my first two were 14 months apart and played<br/>
together nonstop as well) and resting any moment I could. I do remember<br/>
feeling tired all of the time too.<br/>
<br/>
There is a lot of time for socializing. And they already are socializing<br/>
with each other! Many families don&#39;t get to have the live-in playmates that<br/>
your family has. Do you think that they will let you know what more they<br/>
want as they get a little older?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Renee,<br/>
<br/>
My family is just starting this &#39;phase.&#39;  We recently (3 weeks ago) moved to the Dallas area from the Austin area.  In Austin we had lots of friends of all ages, and a great unschooling community.  Now, here, we have lots of opportunities to be in different unschooling-heavy groups/organizations/activities/park days, but my daughter doesn&#39;t want to participate.  She has always been the social butterfly.  She gets along and likes everyone from newborns to 97 year-olds and all the ages in between, but suddenly she doesn&#39;t want to go out.  She&#39;s not depressed.  She&#39;s just as happy as she&#39;s ever been.  She now lives in a house instead of an apartment.  Occasionally she has said things about making new friends and we&#39;ll discuss the options and requirements (like meeting times) and then she goes off to do something.  Later I&#39;ll bring it up and she&#39;ll say she&#39;s still getting used to her new house.  So, I&#39;m trying not to push it.  I&#39;m enjoying the time we&#39;re spending together, but I must admit that I miss the camaraderie of the unschooling moms once a week at park days.<br/>
<br/>
More to your concern, I think you should let your kids be your guide in this.  Offer different opportunities as you come to learn about them, but let the children decide if they&#39;d like to partake.  When something strikes their fancy, they&#39;ll want to participate.  Don&#39;t worry.<br/>

new friends.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Renee, I&#39;ve been going through something similar and I was going to <br/>
say about the same things! Sometimes just chatting with the people in <br/>
stores is enough &quot;socializing&quot; for us in a day. I&#39;m trying really <br/>
hard to not think about anything other than what do we need today.<br/>
<br/>
We went from having neighbors we saw almost daily and going to an <br/>
exercise class 3 times a week (exercise for me, that is, with <br/>
babysitting the kids really enjoyed) to mostly being at home--I&#39;m <br/>
pregnant and feeling rotten. Sometimes the kids are do get stir crazy <br/>
and then we get out, but other times they are happy and I don&#39;t need <br/>
to worry about it at the moment. I&#39;m focusing on them--I swear, if I <br/>
look directly at them and maintain eye contact it&#39;s harder to worry <br/>
about the past or future and I just enjoy the moment and can see what <br/>
they need right now.<br/>
<br/>
And like you said in your original post, my two have been playing so <br/>
happily together, which is a whole lot of &quot;socialization&quot; isn&#39;t it? i <br/>
think the only thing they are really lacking at the moment is more <br/>
physical play. Now that the weather is cooling off, it&#39;s easier to be <br/>
outside in the late afternoon when I have more energy, so we&#39;ll be <br/>
getting out more when the neighborhood kids are home from school <br/>
(which is a mixed blessing).<br/>
