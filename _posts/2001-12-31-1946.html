I found a couple of unschooling families at the homeschool registry and one <br/>
at unschooling.com.<br/>
So the internet is a good way to try and find unschoolers in your area also...<br/>
but you probably knew that.<br/>
I could send you the link for the homeschool registry if you&#39;d like, do you <br/>
have that one?<br/>
Good luck,<br/>
