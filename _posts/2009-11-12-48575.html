<div id="ygrps-yiv-1564786687"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt; The b-day cake was so beautiful and they, like all the other  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>children were enamoured with it. I wasn&#39;t sure whether I should tell  <br/>
them it was wheat or not. I knew that the disappointment of that would  <br/>
make them cry and feel deprived and ashamed of being different. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
It might have helped them to know that the cake part was wheat but  <br/>
that the icing part was not.  I have witnessed plenty of children  <br/>
enjoy just the icing part off their cake, sometimes to the annoyance  <br/>
of their parents.  Admiring the cake with them and talking about how  <br/>
beautiful it is is another way to join in the fun.  Your concern over  <br/>
spoiling the beautiful &quot;cake moment&quot; with the reality of future pain  <br/>
is understandable but there are usually more than two options.   <br/>
Perhaps the disappointment of what was in the cake, wheat, could be  <br/>
softened by really enjoying the presentation and eating as much of the  <br/>
frosting as they wanted.  They could decide for themselves whether the  <br/>
pain of having wheat was worth tasting the cake part or not.<br/>
