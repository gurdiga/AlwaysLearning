<div id="ygrps-yiv-795542496">This is my first post, and in light of Sandra&#39;s recent reminder, I hope I don&#39;t get off on the wrong foot.<p></p><div><br></div><div>Yesterday I had some alone time with my son, Isaac (almost 5), who was musing about being glad he lives in Canada. &nbsp;I asked why, and he floored me by saying &quot;I like living in Canada because there are more white people than brown people&quot;. &nbsp;I told him I don&#39;t think that&#39;s even true, and that one of the things I like most about Canada is that it&#39;s not. &nbsp;Honestly, I can&#39;t even remember exactly how things progressed from there, I was so hurt. &nbsp;I, myself, am brown. &nbsp;He is very white. &nbsp;I pointed out how half his family is brown, and his closest cousins (first cousins) are all brown. &nbsp;I said, &quot;I thought Ethan was your best friend. &nbsp;He&#39;s brown&quot;. &nbsp;And then he told me &quot;yeah, I like SOME brown people&quot;.</div><div><br></div><div>I told him that saying things like that is really insulting and hurtful to others, and he then cycled between telling me&nbsp;that he had really meant to say &quot;there are lots of white people and brown people&quot;, that&nbsp;he was joking, and (when I told him I couldn&#39;t think of a single person I knew who would agree that was funny) defending his position. &nbsp; He&#39;s very sensitive to criticism, generally, and these three reactions are typical. &nbsp;I told him that people are people and how we look doesn&#39;t affect who we are, and kind of left it at that. &nbsp;He was happy to leave the subject behind.</div><div><br></div><div>I didn&#39;t feel like I could let go, though. &nbsp;Before bed I brought the subject up when my husband was also present, and I guess we made Isaac feel cornered because as he cycled through his three stances he was doing so angrily and aggressively. &nbsp;I had to leave, going to the bathroom to cry; Isaac and Ian came in later and Isaac tried to make me feel better, but it was more of the &quot;I meant to say&quot;, which I couldn&#39;t really believe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I guess the core issue I have is:</div><div><br></div><div>How do I communicate that something is completely and unequivocally WRONG, when my son shuts down or lashes out at the slightest implication that he&#39;s even veering off in a questionable direction?</div><div><br></div><div>Alana</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-419327105">I can understand how initially your sons thoughts may have startled or hurt you. But I would encourage you to consider your son&#39;s age and development. Is he really capable of drawing a hard line in the sand regarding his preference for the different races or skin colors? If he is anything like my son, he probably changes his mind several times a week about what he likes and dislikes. His world is forever changing right now, and he is busy exploring it and trying to figure it out. <br/>
 My son who is now five once looked at me and his father who are both totally blind and very emphatically told us that sighted people were better than blind people and he was glad he was not blind. My initial thought process was similar to yours How in the world have I convinced my son that being blind is inferior to being cited? What did I do to give him this impression. But when I thought about it for a second, I realized that he is just making statements trying to understand his world and trying to engage us in a conversation about blindness and non- blind individuals. It wasn&#39;t really about who he thought was better and I don&#39;t even believe he was really making a judgment call. Instead of getting upset at him, we very calmly asked him why he thought what  he thought and allowed him to voice his feelings. I have never heard him mention such things again. I think a part of these type of statements could be the child trying to understand why they are different from their parents. In your case your skin is dark and your sons is light. He is probably trying to understand how that could be, and why he is not the same as you. In my case my kids will probably wonder why they are not blind like me and their father, I think that it is important that we try to help our children understand that being different is okay, and allow them to explore their feelings regarding their differences or similarities.</div>

If I was to say anything about, say, a minority race, I&#39;d have a background knowledge in my mind of history, politics, different cultures, inequality, possibly atrocities... that&#39;s all going to contribute to what I think/say.

I remember the first few days listening to the show felt different and i didn&#39;t enjoy it, and I said to my dad that I didn&#39;t like female DJs. He was horrified, and said to me that he couldn&#39;t believe that, as a girl, I&#39;d said that and thought it was ok and how would I like it if someone said I couldn&#39;t do something because I was female? I felt really confused because I hadn&#39;t said any of that, and I felt (as I often did at school) that I was being penalised for not knowing something that I&#39;d never been told about. I didn&#39;t really know at the time about gender inequality, suffrage, woman&#39;s rights, equality in the workplace etc. All I&#39;d felt was the loss of a familiar soundtrack to my journey to school, and had worded it the best way I could articulate at the time.</p><p style="line-height:1.22em;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:0px;"><br></p><p style="line-height:1.22em;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:0px;">Tam</p></div></div></div></span><br>Sent from my iPhone</div><div><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> On 24 Sep 2013, at 04:21, Ali Zeljo &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:azeljo@...">azeljo@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br><br></span></blockquote></div><blockquote type="cite"><div><blockquote type="cite"><div id="ygrps-yiv-2073480320ygrp-mlmsg"><div id="ygrps-yiv-2073480320ygrp-msg"><div id="ygrps-yiv-2073480320ygrp-text"><p>-=-<span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">&quot;I like living in Canada because there are more white people than brown people&quot;. &nbsp;I told him I don&#39;t think that&#39;s even true-=-</span></p></div></div></div></blockquote></div><div><div><div><p><span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">I have a four, almost five year old son who has made a few big claims similar to this. &nbsp;One recent one was &quot;I hate all womens&quot;. &nbsp;I can see how your son&#39;s seemingly racist comment triggered you, but I am guessing his young brain was working hard to figure out something about the world around him- and didn&#39;t mean his comment as deeply as an adult would</span></p></div></div></div></blockquote><div></div></html></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-478011076"><p class="ygrps-yiv-478011076MsoNormal">-- A young child saying something about people with brown
skin would maybe be no different to saying something about people who wear blue
trousers.—</p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-478011076MsoNormal">-- I think this pinpoints the communication gap - Isaac
often tells me to look at the &#39;black guy&#39;, who is actually a Chinese man
wearing black. &nbsp;I get a little uncomfortable at the idea of someone
misunderstanding him, but it&#39;s pretty easy for me to get his thought process
and not freak out. &nbsp;When he said something that on the surface seemed to
be a value judgment, I guess I lost the perspective that he&#39;s still so very
young.--</p><p class="ygrps-yiv-478011076MsoNormal"><br></p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-478011076MsoNormal">I agree with the idea in this thread that this child is four
years old and, like the stories shared about children saying they don’t like
female DJs, don’t like women, are glad they aren’t blind, these statements are
not permanent judgments but instead experiments with language and categories,
ways to express themselves and identify. And for a four-year-old, skin color
may be a category that works like pants color. And I agree that apologizing for
freaking out may be the best way open up communication and better understand
why the child said this about brown people.</p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-478011076MsoNormal">However, my impression from this story is that he is also experimenting
with the concept that saying something about people with brown skin is very
different than saying something about people who wear blue trousers.</p><p class="ygrps-yiv-478011076MsoNormal"><br></p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-478011076MsoNormal">-- I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s so easy for me to trust my children
will grow out of the need to breastfeed, or sleep close to me, or be carried so
much, but I panicked at the thought of this &#39;opinion&#39; being permanent.—</p><p class="ygrps-yiv-478011076MsoNormal"><br></p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-478011076MsoNormal">While this panic may not be the better choice, it’s
understandable. Race is likely going to be a difficult and decisive issue for a
mixed child for a long time, and it’s such a loaded issue in terms of how our
society works that I wanted to add to this discussion more attention to how
this is different than thinking breastfeeding will be permanent, and a quote
about a parent “unschooling” themselves and rethinking race in order to move
away from being afraid that their child will reject the parent’s identity. This
can come up again and again, and the quote below might be helpful in rethinking
the relationship between a child’s learning process and race as a category . Because
to me, the original post on this thread isn’t about “unschooling and
intolerance.” From what the son said (which, again, you might find is about
something completely different than race for this particular four-year-old <span style="">&nbsp;</span>after talking more), he might “tolerate” brown
people, but is experimenting with categorizing types of people by race, i.e.
racism. So I also think the following quote is helpful in thinking about race
not as “tolerance” or “intolerance” for a defined group of people, but as a
potential (and loaded) category for organizing people in the first place. I see
the writer in the quote below as moving from fear and a desire to teach his
child about race and toward unschooling concepts—listening to the child’s
interest and experience and desires—as the essay progresses. </p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-478011076MsoNormal">This is from “Beautiful on All Sides” by Tomas Moniz in <i style="">Rad Dad: Dispatches from the Frontiers of
Fatherhood</i>, pages 59-63. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-9781604864816-3</p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;" class="ygrps-yiv-478011076MsoNormal"><br></p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-478011076MsoNormal">“My youngest daughter wants to be white.</p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-478011076MsoNormal">Or that’s my fear. What I really should say is that my
youngest daughter has entered the stage of seeing ethnicity for what it is—socially
constructed symbols of meaning, ways of inclusion and exclusion; she now
actively looks to associate things with ethnicity.</p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-478011076MsoNormal">. . .</p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-478011076MsoNormal">Ella, my youngest, is light. Ella sees the struggles her
mother and I have with our son and his associations with urban male culture;
she sees my son’s attempt to connect with certain things and so she is choosing
the other path. . . So she likes houses in the hills, hates graffiti and
hip-hop, wants to dress properly, wants to follow the rules. She is incredibly
perceptive, and she’s aware that it’s about ethnicity and class in those ways
kids know and can allude to if not outright question.</p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-478011076MsoNormal"><i style="">“Why can’t everyone
live in north Berkeley, if it’s this nice?”</i></p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-478011076MsoNormal">. . </p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-478011076MsoNormal">In this U.S. culture race is fixed, static—you’re black or
Mexican or Asian. And for white folks, U.S. culture (read: whiteness) refuses
to see itself, and instead, white folks tend to buy into the belief in the
universal, which of course is whiteness, that’s the privilege of being white in
the U.S.—you don’t have to see it.</p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-478011076MsoNormal">But for a growing majority of people, ethnicity is fluid; it’s
piecemeal, chosen, reclaimed, refused, relearned. There is a damage of appropriation;
there is a need to be clear on intent and responsibility; there is a need for
dialog, lots of it. I guess as my daughter brings up again and again ethnicity,
I should relish the opportunity to talk about it. As we read stories and look
at the pictures: <i style="">Oh, she has hair like
mine, I wanna be her. </i>In the media: <i style="">Why
does the donkey from </i>Shrek<i style=""> sound
black? </i>In our family: <i style="">Dad, how come
grandma stopped calling you Tomas?</i> In how we each define ourselves.</p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-478011076MsoNormal">As parents, that is our struggle: to be honest, even when it
is scary. To be truthful, even when it weighs heavy on our shoulders, when it
might hurt, when it implicates us, our choices, our past, perhaps our future.
We need to be willing to be open, direct, to call out racism when we see it,
but be willing to listen to ideas and experiences from our kids as they begin
to see, test, choose identities different from our own. I have wanted to
protect my kids, wanted to give them a history that embraced all aspects of
their identities in positive, powerful ways. I wanted to create an environment
where ethnicity was so visible that it lost its meaning, and we became who we
wanted to be, not limited by definitions but not a nebulous attempt at universality.
We are and aren’t things. Learn, choose, be accountable. But perhaps it is me
that needs to relearn and trust, to step back and see how we can be white and
brown; we can even bgirls or gboys all at the same time.” </p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1559765324"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I told him that saying things like that is really insulting and hurtful to others&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When I was a young girl, probably about your son&#39;s age, I was afraid of old people.  I really didn&#39;t know a lot of old people, but the ones I did know weren&#39;t very kind.  As well, the cartoons and tv shows of the time portrayed old people in a crotchety light.  At least in the light from which I was viewing. <br/>
<br/>
As I grew, I must have begun to realize that there really wasn&#39;t anything particularly frightening about older people because I don&#39;t remember it being much of an issue for me after a certain point.  I can&#39;t tell you what changed my mind - more experience I suppose.<br/>
<br/>
When Ethan was very young he told me that men of colour frightened him.  Internally, I was really blown away.  I felt like I had failed my son.  But I remember what I said very clearly, in part because it seemed to take me so long to form that one word.  The word was &quot;Okay.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
In the years that followed, stories, videos, and life have offered us many opportunities to talk about issues surrounding race among other things.  Ethan has watched me and Doug interact with people of colour, people old and young, people who practice different religions, people of different socioeconomic classes, as well as people who practice a variety of lifestyles from monogamy to polyamory, and sexual orientations from heterosexual to homosexual and bisexual. Now that he is older it is becoming clear that he is understanding the complexities of human diversity more and more.  To be honest, so much more than I did in my twenties even.  <br/>
<br/>
Still to this day, and likely tomorrow, there are and will be times when *I* fumble awkwardly with prejudices I haven&#39;t fully addressed or even been made aware of yet.  The best thing I can do for my son is to show him that when I make mistakes about people, I make an effort to understand my ignorance.<br/>

We are all learning about one another, and figuring out how to make sense of how we feel about each other and where we fit in to the soup we find ourselves in.  It&#39;s a delicious soup, but for many of us, it is an acquired taste that takes a little more time, experience and understanding to fully, honestly and joyfully appreciate all of the flavours it offers.</div>
