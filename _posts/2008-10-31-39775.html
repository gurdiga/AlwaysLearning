<br/>
Unschooling does work better when people are cheerful and positive  <br/>
and hopeful and at peace.<br/>
<br/>
Anything that harms or mars or dilutes cheer, positivity, hope and  <br/>
peace is in the negative column.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OF COURSE people are sad sometimes, and grumpy, and sometimes there  <br/>
are frustrations and setbacks.  If you accept those as inevitable and  <br/>
good and no worse than joy and laughter, your unschooling won&#39;t be  <br/>
optimal.  If you have no preference for a joyful life, how will you  <br/>
achieve one?<br/>
<br/>
If a person justifies negativity and clings to it and defends it, she  <br/>
is not choosing joy.<br/>
<br/>
When you&#39;re making those thousands of choices you make every day,  <br/>
have a focus.<br/>
<br/>
In any moment, if a mom is reviewing for herself the bad things her  <br/>
child experienced in school, then she&#39;s in school, and he&#39;s in school  <br/>
in her head, and she&#39;s not with him NOW, at home, in her house, in  <br/>
that moment.<br/>
<br/>
That is pollution.  That doesn&#39;t go at ALL far toward focusing on  <br/>
positive things.<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t change our children&#39;s pasts.  We can fail to improve this  <br/>
moment by dwelling in the past.<br/>

agree with that.  I wanted to hear other&#39;s experiences, yet in another<br/>
post.  Still, this has brought me to another similar thought.  Isn&#39;t<br/>
there a difference between &quot;dwelling in the past&quot;  and learning about<br/>
or from the past?  <br/>
<br/>
I feel that I do not dwell in the past, yet I see it creep up in him<br/>
sometimes.  So, what I&#39;m getting is that I should just accept it for<br/>
what it is, for who he is, and not worry about the &quot;why&quot; or the<br/>
&quot;where&quot; it came from?  I can definitely do that.  That would be<br/>
equivalent to giving him a label.  Like &quot;school syndrome&quot;.  <br/>

Coincidence, maybe, but...<br/>
<br/>
Moods are contagious, and some people have never really been around a  <br/>
lot of joy and happiness, which is just another reason for me to keep  <br/>
the mood here as up and light as possible.    Joy should be promoted  <br/>
here.<br/>

they wanted support for their hope that life sucked and it was okay  <br/>

people&#39;s lives.  It&#39;s bad in any life, but it&#39;s deadly for unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
This is what I share with my kid. We all make mistakes. It&#39;s part and <br/>
parcel of life. Every moment of our lives, decisions are made. Some <br/>
are informed ones, some are not. Some good, some bad. But we can <br/>
always try to see the positive side of everything. A lesson in <br/>
disguise, is how I approach my bad decisions. Flip the bad, and it&#39;ll <br/>
tunr over to something good. Always 2 side to evrything.  <br/>
<br/>
And I honestly cannot say I regret sending my kid to school. Not <br/>
because I&#39;m cruel or heartless but because, how can I regret making <br/>
that decision when at that time I seriously thought I was doing the <br/>
best I can for my child? I didn&#39;t know any better then.<br/>
<br/>
But because it was a bad decision, and a HUGE one, this means me and <br/>
my kid is now very very well informed and wont&#39; be making that same <br/>
mistake again. So to me, it had to happened for we couldn&#39;t have gone <br/>
into homeschooling and unschooling without it happening. <br/>
<br/>
We talked alot about it, somewhere towards the end of our 1st year out <br/>
of school. It&#39;s ok to talk, it is part and parcel of our learning and <br/>
living. <br/>
<br/>
I agree it&#39;s not good if one is constantly focusing on the pain and <br/>
negativity, and cannot see the positiveness infront of them. So it is <br/>
important to help &quot;contrast that&quot; to the child by pointing out the <br/>
postiviness and freedom of life now. <br/>
<br/>
It helps to remind them, they&#39;re no longer living in the past, for the <br/>
past is only images, and cannot hurt them. In the beginning, I find it <br/>
helpful to point out the freedom of choice placed infront of my son.<br/>
<br/>
What would he want to do now, at this moment? I encouraged him to try <br/>
to breakout of that box in his mind, and do something radical and non <br/>
conforming. Afterall, like I tell my son, who&#39;s gonna stop you? <br/>
<br/>
So we not only talk, but we are very pro-active about it too. My son&#39;s <br/>
idea of freedom and non-conformity means taking a long drive into town <br/>
to go to Toy-R-us, just because we can and is allowed to LOL!! I do <br/>
think at that time, he was also testing MY genuinity, the offer of <br/>
freedom of choice LOL!! This is where our unschooling really begins. <br/>
<br/>
We dont&#39; dwell on it but do still talk about it occasionally when he <br/>
brings up a certain situation. But it is more of him now doing  <br/>
a &quot;comparison&quot; of some sort, between what we&#39;re happily doing now and <br/>
what they grudgingly had to do in school. <br/>
<br/>
My son understands that school was a decision we made, he thought it&#39;s <br/>
a fun decision where else mummy and daddy thought it&#39;s the best <br/>
decision. Until we all realised it wasn&#39;t!<br/>
<br/>
We have discarded that bad decision about school, left it behind, and <br/>
have moved onto better pasture. We made a decision to homeschool, even <br/>
this was discarded in favour of unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
So, now, we&#39;re more informed and wiser about the life choices and <br/>
freedom we have, than we were ever before. And so, live moves on. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2084018573">Ooops! Sorry, didn&#39;t realised I was replying to a thread about <br/>
Sandra talking about pollution to the list. <br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;m gonna flip this to something cheerful.<br/>
<br/>
My kid&#39;s just turned 8, 2 days ago. It&#39;s also the 23rd month of our <br/>
homeschooling/ unschooling. My son surprises me all the time with <br/>
his understanding of alot of things around him. Like , I said 23rd <br/>
month, he&#39;ll reply 1 yr and 11 months. When it comes to money, he&#39;s <br/>
lightning speed with how much he&#39;s got, and what he&#39;s gonna buy LOL!<br/>
<br/>
Our unschooling life is so different from where we started. I feel <br/>
like we have come a long way. Hey, what do I know, my &quot;year long <br/>
holiday break&quot; trick worked, and we have successfully progressed <br/>
into almost 2 years of unschooling - and my son is still in one <br/>
piece, and alive, and has managed to progress many grade ahead of <br/>
his peers.<br/>
<br/>
And surprised surprised, I&#39;m happy and content, and not in an asylum <br/>
LOL!! <br/>
<br/>
Let me share a typical picture of our unschooling life. It is <br/>
absolutely sloth-like, just how we like it. <br/>
<br/>
We wake up and have breakfast. I&#39;m on emails and DS watches tv or <br/>
play with his PSP or DS. Currently he&#39;s either playing Lego Batman <br/>
or training his puppy on NintenDogs. Around lunch time, we&#39;re washed <br/>
and changed and we continue what we&#39;re doing. DS normally fit in <br/>
some Lego building sometime during the day. Sometimes, we both sit <br/>
down and go on his Jumpstart or Cluefinders program. <br/>
<br/>
The past weeks he has progressed into the garden, burning stuff. And <br/>
of course, in the past 1 month, we had his best friend coming over <br/>
daily after lunch, so the boys basically just play until it&#39;s dinner <br/>
time. Of which DS then goes home to best friend&#39;s house till hubby <br/>
picks him up at 8.30pm. At the moment, they have managed to convert <br/>
my dining table into a whole Lego City, with little buildings and <br/>
cars and all. <br/>
<br/>
We do go out for long walks to shops and best friend&#39;s house to pick <br/>
him up sometimes, but rarely venture out anyway far nowadays because <br/>
we&#39;re car-less. The boys are also into skate boarding so this means <br/>
I&#39;ll have to get the car situation sorted out. <br/>
<br/>
Tonight is Halloween. My kid&#39;s gone with his bfriend and family to <br/>
visit someone else, so I&#39;m feeling lonely and abandoned &lt;sniff <br/>
sniff&gt;. It strange when you get the house all to yourself and it&#39;s <br/>
so quiet LOL!<br/>
<br/>
But it wn&#39;t be long, the chaos will descent again for the sleepover <br/>
is in my house tonight !!!<br/>
<br/>
Happy trick-a-treating Everyone. <br/>
<br/>
Big Higs,<br/>

******<br/>
<br/>
But for children whom benefit from your clarity, delivered in response to some negativity<br/>
expressed, isn&#39;t there some major lifting of the weight present in their lives ?<br/>
Is counter arguments beneficial for the really almost hopeless situations ?<br/>
<br/>
The energy shifts from neg to positive if/when the &quot;lost&#39;&#39; causes are defended.<br/>
<br/>
I have been awaken several times by just reading some of those. For instance you spoke a <br/>
while ago about mothers whom might alleviate their own lives by jumping onto unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I have been weary of not falling in such category and by all means<br/>
I m not always 100 p cent confident that I manage.<br/>
<br/>
Some portraits of wrong can scare for life. I believe it can be useful.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway I guess I am saying thank you !<br/>
