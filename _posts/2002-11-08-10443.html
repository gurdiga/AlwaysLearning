&lt;&lt; Since they&#39;re young, I would go with Nintendo.  I&#39;d get a Nintendo 64 for <br/>
 them (Holly concurs) which you can probably buy used and also you can get <br/>
 LOTS of used games which will be good for kids. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what we started with. Got the whole set up, including three games for <br/>
just $50 at a pawn shop.<br/>
We&#39;re planning to add a game cube, which you can play the new Mario Sunshine <br/>
game on that won all the awards recently.  The games are more cartoon like <br/>
for the game cube usually. Which I think is great for younger children, <br/>
although my almost 13 y.o. really likes them still.<br/>
I would start with the N64 too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1231181243">Z (he&#39;s 8) has been having a lot of fun playing Xbox Live with his dad. My husband has been working a lot so I&#39;m letting them have fun together but the games they play are all first-person shooters. It&#39;s not really the game that is bugging me but the aggression my son is showing as he plays, yelling, calling names, threatening etc. I know he&#39;s just playing a game but there have been occassions where he&#39;s used the same type of aggression while dealing with other non-game things (although not to the same extent). It&#39;s kind of alarming to see an 8 year telling someone on the game he&#39;s gonna slit their throat (one of the games is a war game where they can sneak up behind someone and slit their throat!) or laughing over the fact that he killed someone. Okay it&#39;s not &quot;kind of&quot; alarming; it&#39;s really alarming and I&#39;m really uncomfortable with it and not enjoying this aspect of the games.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m wondering how to handle this or if I should even handle it at all. Should I wait and see what comes of it, should I talk with him, should I talk with my husband, should I always make sure one of us is playing with him? How should I handle this in a way that is not overreacting but not ignoring the situation either? Help me not botch this...<br/>

<br/>
Well, this may not seem too helpful, and may even cause distress to think<br/>
about, however, I recommend you play the game with him and jump right in<br/>
there with the same enthusiasm and language, without judgment. Be with him<br/>
where he is at. I&#39;m guessing you&#39;ll get a much better understanding of the<br/>
game and your son. And playing games with our kids only fosters deeper<br/>
relationships and connectedness. Which can lead to more fruitful discussions<br/>
about real-life issues when they come up.<br/>
<br/>
It is pretty difficult to confuse virtual people and situations with real<br/>
life ones, and sometimes it takes playing the game for adults to see that.<br/>
Having four teenagers who all have played unlimited video games, and started<br/>
on some of the &quot;M&quot; games at young ages, they never confused how to treat<br/>
real people and things with how to treat virtual people and things.<br/>
<br/>
If your son is treating real people badly, that is something to discuss and<br/>
work on. It may not be at all related to the video games. The video games<br/>
may actually help him have a place where he CAN act that way.<br/>

UnschoolingBasics &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/</a>&gt; about<br/>
this very topic:<br/>
<br/>
*************************************************************<br/>
*Q:* Another thing I find hard to accept about video games is the culture of<br/>
violence. It does not sit right to tell kids not to hit each other and<br/>
to be cooperative when you&#39;re playing Kill Stuff In A Good Story IV?<br/>
Isn&#39;t that a contradiction?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
*A:* It&#39;s been almost a FULL DAY, and Deb Lewis hasn&#39;t yet commented on<br/>
violence?! She must be out of town! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;ll be by shortly, I&#39;m sure....<br/>
<br/>
Duncan has a friend who was playing Nintendogs. He had 4-5 dogs, all<br/>
happy and well-cared for. He decided to starve one. He wanted to see<br/>
how far the game would go. He&#39;d feed the other dogs in front of it. It<br/>
would beg and whine. It grew thinner and thinner. Weaker and weaker.<br/>
C-r-a-w-l-i-n-g along the floor. It did anything to get his attention.<br/>
It was so pathetic!<br/>
<br/>
We moms were FREAKING OUT!<br/>
<br/>
Now, Duncan *adores* his Nintendogs. He only keeps as many as he can<br/>
care for and got angry at Cameron&#39;s girlfriend, who played with his DS<br/>
and bought another dog---but then went home after the weekend, leaving<br/>
*her* new dog for Duncan to care for. &quot;Doesn&#39;t she realize that a dog&#39;s<br/>
a big responsibility? That she can&#39;t just *get* one and then forget<br/>
about it?&quot; So he&#39;s *very* attached to and cares a lot about his virtual<br/>
pets.<br/>
<br/>
But he also realizes that these are just pixels.<br/>
<br/>
Now...I don&#39;t really know what a &quot;pixel&quot; IS, but I do know that they<br/>
aren&#39;t real dogs. &lt;g&gt; Nevertheless, the boy who was starving his<br/>
virtual dog had my stomach in a knot.<br/>
<br/>
He was experimenting with the GAME. He would *never* starve his own<br/>
REAL dogs! I guess I *know* that in my mind, but my heart was breaking<br/>
for this starving pup...uh...pixel.<br/>
<br/>
I think many adults have a hard time understanding that these are<br/>
simply games---NO ONE is getting hurt---not a soul! Nor would these<br/>
children purposefully harm anyone IRL. But this a VIRTUAL world. Wild<br/>
and crazy things can be done in a virtual world---things none of these<br/>
children would ever *consider* doing in real life! They can be strong<br/>
super-heroes and super-villains. They can starve sweet, little pups.<br/>
They can save and destroy planets. It&#39;s a GAME! Absolutley NO violence<br/>
is being committed! Absolutely NO damage is being done!<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand... &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When a parent trivializes what a child holds dear or throws away or<br/>
sells a child&#39;s game or denies a child time to play...then REAL damage<br/>
is being done to that child and that relationship.<br/>
<br/>
The *parent* has the power over the child and is wielding it to suit<br/>
the parent. A child feels small and powerless. THAT&#39;s real damage! A<br/>
parent that spanks or pops or smacks or paddles or whips a<br/>
child---THAT&#39;s real violence!<br/>
<br/>
What about the children that DO play violent games and then go out and<br/>
shoot up a school?<br/>
<br/>
Do you think that those children were loved and accepted for Who They<br/>
Are by everyone close to them? Or do you think they were laughed at and<br/>
ridiculed and coerced and denied and trumped on a regular basis? Do you<br/>
think they were trusted and respected and treasted with kindness and<br/>
patience and generosity? Or do you think their parents wished they<br/>
could fix or change them---or just wish that they were *different*?<br/>
<br/>
Columbine shooters don&#39;t get that way because they were allowed to play<br/>
video games. They get that way because the people who should have loved<br/>
them most didn&#39;t treat them with respect and kindness and accept that<br/>
Who They Are was good enough.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve met almost all the kids whose parents write here regularly. Not an<br/>
axe-murderer among them! &lt;G&gt; Gentle, kind, thoughtful kids who love to<br/>
kill and starve pixels. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Using Might over Right will get you short-term results. Using Right<br/>
over Might takes a little longer---more thought, more patience, more<br/>
work!---but it&#39;s a life-long relationship you&#39;re after, right?<br/>
<br/>
Video games don&#39;t cause violent children. But children who are exposed<br/>
to real violence *very* often become violent.<br/>
**<br/>
=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
*Q: *Someone mentioned is it right to give up something because it causes<br/>
grumpiness? If it made someone grumpy for my to pick my nose in front<br/>
of them, yes I would need to give that up to fit in with manners.<br/>
-=-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
*A: *Picking your nose in public is considered bad manners in this society.<br/>
It doesn&#39;t matter whether it makes someone grumpy or not. What *YOU* do<br/>
cannot make *ME* grumpy. I get to *choose* how *I* feel about<br/>
everything. *YOU* are not responsible for *MY* feelings.<br/>
<br/>
My mother used to say, &quot;You make me embarrassed when you do ________.&quot;<br/>
Uh....No. I can&#39;t *make* her be embarrassed. *She* gets to make the<br/>
decision whether to be embarrassed or not.<br/>
<br/>
Playing video games doesn&#39;t *make* someone else feel grumpy. There&#39;s<br/>
something *else* going on there. There are other options than simply<br/>
limited gaming time.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-115829391">I think fantasy is such a necessary part of being a child.  I think<br/>
through fantasy, children can develop the emotions and tools they need<br/>
to feel in control in real life situations.  <br/>
<br/>
I personally don&#39;t find it alarming.  Kids know the difference between<br/>
make believe and real life.  I&#39;ll admit, I might have gasped when my 3<br/>
year old started running around yelling, &quot;Die Suckers!!!&quot;.  My two<br/>
love to watch those violent stick figure videos, run around with guns<br/>
and swords (usually some version of them anyway) and play video games<br/>
that I wouldn&#39;t have chosen for them. I don&#39;t find &quot;I&#39;m gonna slit<br/>
your throat&quot; alarming.  Strong words, pretend words, but not alarming.<br/>
  Communicate with him about it.  Don&#39;t react negatively, but with S.<br/>
we talk about how his words can make other kids feel.  But if the two<br/>
kids are having fun then it isn&#39;t a problem.  It&#39;s pretend.   <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t react to it at all.  I just keep open communication.  Lately<br/>
our talks are about the internet.  What he sends to other kids, and<br/>
how other parents might react to that.  He has a lot of public school<br/>
friends due to sports (and the lack of unschoolers his age around<br/>
here)so I know that not all parents are as free as we are and I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t want other children catching any heat.  :-) Since I don&#39;t<br/>
react negatively to the things he loves, he trusts me and I know he<br/>
won&#39;t be hiding anything from me.  That&#39;s most important to me.  That<br/>
he doesn&#39;t feel he needs to be sneaky.  then I&#39;m aware of what he is<br/>
seeing, and we can keep that communication door wide open.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if this will help at all.  It&#39;s just what came to me.  I<br/>
think there is a book out there called &quot;Killing Monsters&quot;.  it&#39;s about<br/>
EXACTLY this topic.  I have know idea if its any good.  Has anyone<br/>
here read it? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So I&#39;m wondering how to handle this or if I should even handle it at<br/>

should I talk with my husband, should I always make sure one of us is<br/>
playing with him? How should I handle this in a way that is not<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1697792406">-=-I know he&#39;s just playing a game but there have been occassions  <br/>
where he&#39;s used the same type of aggression while dealing with other  <br/>
non-game things (although not to the same extent). -=-<br/>
<br/>
I think most little boys play with aggression.  When I was a kid and  <br/>
video games were far in the future and TV was in black and white, we  <br/>
played WWII on the playground at school, and cowboys and Indians in  <br/>
the orchard at home.  To be fair, in the WWII games which went on a  <br/>
few weeks in 2nd grade (I was 7) I was a nurse, and my job was to  <br/>
sprinkle sand on fallen soldiers to revive them.   We were playing  <br/>
between two army barracks that had been bought by the school for  <br/>
additional classrooms.<br/>
<br/>
My mom grew up before TV was invented.  They heard radio shows.  They  <br/>
hardly ever had any books, but there was much aggression.  Her  <br/>
brother raped her when he was 14, and died at 15 of rheumatic fever  <br/>
or scarlet fever, one of those.<br/>
<br/>
I mention these things because they are worse than video game play,  <br/>
and because I know of zero acting out of what cartoon characters in  <br/>
video games do.  I know LOTS of young men in their 20&#39;s and 30&#39;s who  <br/>
have played video games their whole lives.  None of them have stolen  <br/>
cars, shot people, slit throats, not so much as shoplifted.  They  <br/>
have jobs, they&#39;ve bought cars, they&#39;re courteous, and then they get  <br/>
together two or three times a week to play World of Warcraft or  <br/>
Halo3.  And one night a week Marty gets together with some of them to  <br/>
do role playing games involving paper and pencils and dice.  On  <br/>
Sundays, some of them are playing capture the flag (not with video  <br/>
games, with running around in a park, and the youngest of them is  <br/>
Marty, at 19).   Several nights a week they&#39;re playing basketball,  <br/>
after Bo gets off work at 10:00.  Outside basketball.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I see having happened with people who played all the  <br/>
video games they wanted to when they were younger (and now).<br/>
<br/>
-=-It&#39;s kind of alarming to see an 8 year telling someone on the game  <br/>
he&#39;s gonna slit their throat (one of the games is a war game where  <br/>
they can sneak up behind someone and slit their throat!) or laughing  <br/>
over the fact that he killed someone.-=-<br/>
<br/>
But he didn&#39;t kill anyone.<br/>
<br/>
-=-So I&#39;m wondering how to handle this or if I should even handle it  <br/>
at all. Should I wait and see what comes of it, should I talk with  <br/>

<br/>
Boy Saves Sister from Moose Attack with Skills Learned in Warcraft  <br/>
Video Game<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a little more there, but here some of it:<br/>
<br/>
******<br/>
<br/>
This 12 year-old Norwegian boy saved his sister and himself from a  <br/>
moose attack using skills he picked up in the online role playing  <br/>
game &#39;World of Warcraft.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Hans Jørgen Olsen and his sister got into a spot of trouble when they  <br/>
encroached on the territory of one of these antlered cold weather  <br/>
staples (otherwise known as a moose). When the beast went on the  <br/>
offensive, Hans knew the first thing he had to do was taunt it so  <br/>
that it would leave his sister alone and she could run to safety.  <br/>
&quot;Taunting&quot; is a move one uses in World of Warcraft to get monsters  <br/>
off of the less-well-armored team members.<br/>
<br/>
Once he was a target, Hans remember another skill he&#39;d picked up at  <br/>
level 30 in &#39;World of Warcraft&#39; -- he feigned death. The moose lost  <br/>
interest in the inanimate Hans and wandered off into the woods. When  <br/>
he was safely alone Hans ran back home to share his tale of video  <br/>
game-inspired survival.<br/>
<br/>
******<br/>
<br/>
-=-Since I don&#39;t react negatively to the things he loves, he trusts  <br/>
me and I know he won&#39;t be hiding anything from me. That&#39;s most  <br/>
important to me. That he doesn&#39;t feel he needs to be sneaky. then I&#39;m  <br/>
aware of what he is seeing, and we can keep that communication door  <br/>
wide open. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Not just about video games!! Rules that make kids be sneaky, policies  <br/>
that make kids think parents aren&#39;t so smart--those do irreparable  <br/>
damage to the parent/child relationship.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m not really afraid of the games nor do I feel the need to change it. <br/>
But I did need practical ways for *me* to handle it. Last night I sat <br/>
with him and watched the game. And strangely enough he seemed less <br/>
aggressive. Maybe his over-the-top aggression was just a way of <br/>
bringing me into what he was doing and once I was there with him, he <br/>
didn&#39;t need to do it anymore. <br/>
<br/>
He asked me today to play with him, said he would teach me. I always <br/>
avoided playing in the past but couldn&#39;t remember why. Then it dawned <br/>
on me that while I was still working as a massage therapist, my joints <br/>
would hurt too much while playing video games. But I&#39;m not working <br/>
anymore! Duh! So we have plans for him to show me the ropes after <br/>
dinner. And he&#39;s already planning on me getting my own Live account! LOL<br/>
<br/>
So I will keep ya posted on how this all pans out. I&#39;m so not the <br/>
gaming type, but then maybe I&#39;ve just assumed I wasn&#39;t. You may just <br/>
not hear from me for awhile. hahaha<br/>

Thank you for the video game link BTW. I&#39;ve read through it all before <br/>
but that was awhile ago and before he really played often and he played <br/>
different games so it would probably be more applicable now.<br/>
<br/>
That moose story was cool!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1278218235">My daughter gets together three times a week with a group of kids -  <br/>
mostly of them boys around 18 to 19 years old, who play a lot of video  <br/>
games. They get together for big-group Halo parties where they set up  <br/>
a whole bunch of screens and all play at once, for hours and hours -  <br/>
all night, usually. Halo is very violent, but they are THE sweetest,  <br/>
kindest kids anyone could ever imagine. They also all take karate  <br/>
together, play other games, talk and talk and talk with each other.  <br/>
And, they are unfailingly courteous and attentive and kind to the  <br/>
adults and young children around them. In fact, the one word that  <br/>
would accurately describe any of them is &quot;gentle.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t worry one bit about the violence of video games. If a kid  <br/>
is acting violently toward other people, don&#39;t blame the games, figure  <br/>
out what he needs and why his needs are being frustrated. Treat him  <br/>
kindly and patiently. Model courtesy. And be very solution-oriented  <br/>
with him. I really think that most overly-aggressive behavior directed  <br/>
at other people is frustration-based - it seems to me that kids who  <br/>
are violent haven&#39;t yet learned to respond to frustration looking for  <br/>
a solution. That can take time, but that is more likely the problem  <br/>
than video game violence.<br/>

&gt; cars, shot people, slit throats, not so much as shoplifted. They<br/>
&gt; have jobs, they&#39;ve bought cars, they&#39;re courteous, and then they get<br/>
&gt; together two or three times a week to play World of Warcraft or<br/>
&gt; Halo3. And one night a week Marty gets together with some of them to<br/>
&gt; do role playing games involving paper and pencils and dice. On<br/>
&gt; Sundays, some of them are playing capture the flag (not with video<br/>
&gt; games, with running around in a park, and the youngest of them is<br/>
&gt; Marty, at 19). Several nights a week they&#39;re playing basketball,<br/>
&gt; after Bo gets off work at 10:00. Outside basketball.<br/>

converse intelligently. If he was interested in anything else, that  <br/>
would have probably been something you&#39;d do, naturally. Even if he was  <br/>
fascinated by something that didn&#39;t appeal to you at ALL, snakes or  <br/>
spiders, say, I bet you&#39;d get involved and support his interest. So -  <br/>
yeah - do the same with video games! Handle it the way you&#39;d handle it  <br/>
if he LOVED snakes! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
