<div id="ygrps-yiv-949903821">Hi everyone!  We have been back since Monday evening and I am JUST now<br/>
getting a chance to check in.  Boy and I glad I went &quot;No Mail&quot; cuz I would<br/>
feel like I have to read every digest I received while I was gone...lol  I<br/>
won&#39;t go into details here (will write in my blog when I have more time) but<br/>
I highly recommend people start planning to attend next years Rethinking<br/>
Education (www.rethinkingeducation.com) conference NOW!  It was soooo<br/>
wonderful to be surrounded by parents and grandparents (and hotel staff)<br/>
that have the utmost respect for children.  Hope everyone had a wonderful<br/>
and safe Labor Day weekend!<br/>
 <br/>
In Gratitude,<br/>
