<div id="ygrps-yiv-1508917071">I forget the URL, but there are probably other similar sites anyway.  If you type world time zones or something like that into a search engine, you can easily find out what time it is there compared to here.  I used it while dh was on a trip out of the country.  The girls had fun thinking about what time it was for daddy at various times here.<br/>
