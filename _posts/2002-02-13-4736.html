&lt;&lt;  The blurb says &quot;Make guacamole, perform daring<br/>
experiments, create your own pin hole camera and much, much more.  There is<br/>
no author listed, and I couldn&#39;t find it at Amazon, but I&#39;ll bet if you get<br/>
any of the Scholastic catalogues, you could order it from them.  It might be<br/>
a good stop gap until Sandra gets around to hers.&lt;g&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There y&#39;go.  <br/>
<br/>
There are &quot;things to do with kids in the car&quot; and &quot;outside activities with <br/>
kids&quot; too.  <br/>
<br/>
I figured one of my cards should be something like &quot;Do something from page <br/>
35.  It doesn&#39;t matter which book.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
One thing my kids used to like was if we got a new book that had alphabetical <br/>
things (Greek Gods and Goddesses went over the best) we&#39;d &quot;look up our <br/>
names.&quot;  They weren&#39;t in there, but we&#39;d see which two names each would have <br/>
fallen  between alphabetically, and I&#39;d read those aloud.   <br/>
<br/>
Last night Holly&#39;s bed-book was _Me on the Map,_ a book about a little girl <br/>
in Kansas who&#39;s drawn a map of her bedroom, her house, her street, her town, <br/>
etc.   So the illustrations are a picture of her room, and then a map of it <br/>
(from the same angle, pretty close).  When it gets to the picture of the <br/>
country, which is a cartoonish picture of the country compressed, so you can <br/>
see things visually (to compare with the map on the other page) Holly was <br/>
saying &quot;I&#39;ve been here, and I&#39;ve seen this&quot; about Mt. Rushmore and the arch <br/>
in St. Louis.  I pointed out the capitol building in D.C., too, as something <br/>
she&#39;d seen.<br/>
<br/>
It made me feel really good that she&#39;s gotten to see some things besides her <br/>
own house.  When I was ten I had seen nothing but grandparents&#39; houses, and <br/>
uncles&#39;, in the small range of Colorado Springs to Fort Worth.  When I was <br/>
twenty I hadn&#39;t seen much more.  I&#39;d gone with a boyfriend to Thanksgiving <br/>
with his relatives in southern California.    I travelled more later with SCA <br/>
activities, being a corporate officer, and now speaking at homeschooling <br/>
conferences has gotten me to a couple of places I hadn&#39;t been before.  <br/>
Oregon.  Reno, I had only passed through. Now I&#39;ve passed through and spoken. <br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But Holly has a better idea of where she is and what the world is than anyone <br/>
in my family had, or my parents, or grandparents.  <br/>
<br/>
This doesn&#39;t have anything to do with cards, but it does.  The best hope and <br/>
finest experience, for me, is for one thing to lead to another.  And instead <br/>
of resisting and staying to a predicted outcome or time restraint, it&#39;s <br/>
useful for learning and for learning to live if there is an ease with <br/>
following thoughts and activities to  unexpected places without feeling <br/>
&quot;wrong&quot; about it.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No matter where you go, there you are,&quot; even with ideas.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As you know, I am a list/schedule person.  I used to like to plan the things the kids and I would do and therefore we would do a lot of things.  When we started unschooling all this stopped.  Now I ask the kids what their plans are for the day or if they would like to do something today.<br/>
<br/>
It is very hard for me to include myself in their lives without *my plan*.  So I sit around, mostly on the computer or doing housework, and I wait for opportunities.  Kind of boring for me but if I got going on a project I would tune them out.<br/>
<br/>
The opportunities do come.  Virginia has recently expressed more interest in sign language, got herself sign language books out of the library and asked for help learning it.  I told her I thought it would be easier for her to learn sign language if she had some people to sign with and asked if she wanted to start a sign language club,  which we are doing.  We also went on-line and bought some posters, a game book, a board game, flash cards (she wanted) and a cookie cutter.<br/>
<br/>
I could choose a project a week (of course only if they girls are interested) and a field trip a month to offer to the kids.  That would be a plan :-) ahhhh   a plan!  And somewhere in there I should fit a movie, I think. ?????<br/>
<br/>
I know this sounds stupid to people that this stuff flows for but this is me.  I need a plan.   <br/>
<br/>
Is this still unschooling?  When would I be crossing the line?<br/>

<br/>
Have a plan, no problem. Just don&#39;t worry about sticking to it.<br/>
<br/>
Crossing the line would be to say, &quot;No, we can&#39;t stay at the museum any <br/>
longer, the plan says we have to be making dinner now.&quot;<br/>
