<br/>
This month I miss the weather there. We&#39;re having a sucky winter. Lots of <br/>
cold but no snow. Then we got a little snow, just barely enough for sledding, <br/>
which lasted two days before it rained all day turning it all to mushy ice. <br/>
My 10yo boy is bouncing off the ceiling. It&#39;s no fun playing outside in <br/>
freezing slush or in weather so cold it hurts to breath and REALLY hurts when <br/>
you hit the ground. It&#39;s no fun climbing on park equipment when you freeze to <br/>
it if your not careful. He wants SNOW!<br/>
<br/>
If we can&#39;t have snow, I&#39;d settle for San Diego weather. We had birthday <br/>
parties in the park in December. They do homeschool park days year round <br/>
there. We need activity!<br/>

parks abound.  In fact, we&#39;re off to the indoor pool today.  It seems that <br/>
those areas which have a shorter &quot;indoor&quot; season don&#39;t provide as many of <br/>
these places.<br/>

&quot;Patch of moss.&quot;<br/>

We have to go above 8,000 feet in the mountains to find &quot;patch of moss.&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And this year I don&#39;t know if the moss will even be there.  It was 66 degrees <br/>
yesterday.  It hit 80 in Carlsbad.   The mountains which are usually <br/>
snow-covered near us are still NOT.  The ski run still hasn&#39;t opened, and <br/>
usually opens Thanksgivingish or Christmas.   Scary.<br/>

lack of rain is just sits in the cracks of the pavement, brown but not dead.  <br/>
With the first rains it plumps up and is green within a few days.  Kinda <br/>

channel 11 the other night; that&#39;s where I got my information.  Seeing the<br/>
teen boy with &quot;LAKESIDE&quot; tattooed across his chest, along with swastikas and<br/>
&quot;SS&quot; symbols, was chilling, as was the interview with the teen girl who<br/>
asserted whites were better, but couldn&#39;t string enough words together to<br/>
explain why.  <br/>
<br/>
It is pretty out there, especially along El Monte road where I&#39;m working now<br/>
(not at the 67/Willow intersection at Hazy Meadows!).<br/>
