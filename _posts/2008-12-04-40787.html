====================<br/>
<br/>
Kirby&#39;s handwriting was rough to read until he worked at a pizza  <br/>
place and took phone orders for a week or two right off the bat, and  <br/>
had to learn to write quickly and legibly.  He did.<br/>
<br/>

you&#39;d never know.  (Bob too, I&#39;m guessing; Kirby, certainly.)<br/>
