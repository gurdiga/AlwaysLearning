<br/>
Speaking of unschooling....<br/>
<br/>
MSNBC has been running a series of articles on Unschooling along with a<br/>
poll. So far people are voting that unschooling is nothing more than<br/>
&quot;goofing off&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
If you are an unschooler or know unschoolers and agree that it works, please<br/>
take a moment and vote:<br/>
<br/>
The poll is located here:<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;goofing off&quot;.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This actually grabbed my attention enough to go look. I&#39;m interested <br/>
in the way its worded:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;F -- Learning? Sounds more like goofing around to me.&gt;&gt; <br/>
<br/>
How many kids in school would love to trade in &quot;learning&quot; <br/>
for &quot;goofing around&quot;? I know my stepson, still stuck in ps would. <br/>
<br/>
In real life where does learning end and goofing around begin? I&#39;m a <br/>
craftsperson, and I&#39;m sure I don&#39;t know. <br/>
<br/>
Getting over the whole idea that goofing around isn&#39;t learning, is <br/>
something not only separate from but the opposite of learning, is <br/>
one of the hurdles a lot of us struggle with on the way to &quot;getting&quot; <br/>
unschooling. Its at the heart of all those endless conflicts over tv <br/>
and video games and chores and &quot;discipline&quot; and sometimes food, too. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure I&#39;m &quot;supposed&quot; to be taking this seriously, so that other <br/>
people can &quot;learn&quot; about unschooling, but I&#39;m tempted to just &quot;goof <br/>
around&quot;, mull over the different ideas that spring into my mind and <br/>
ignore the &quot;teachable moment&quot; -oops, I mean the poll- altogether.<br/>
Actually, I went to the site on a whim, just goofing around, but I <br/>
think maybe I learned something in the process - something about <br/>
what I think or believe. I didn&#39;t expect that, but its something <br/>
that happens to me alot in my workshop. <br/>
<br/>
Multiple choice answers always leave me frutrated, anyway. What I <br/>
really want is to combine &quot;b&quot; and &quot;f&quot;, as in:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;This sounds like a pretty good idea, as long as the parents are <br/>
committed to goofing around *with* their kids.&gt;&gt; <br/>
 <br/>
on a more stressfull day it might be:<br/>
&lt;&lt;When will these goofy parents ever learn to commit?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Okay, now I&#39;m *really* goofing around.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1223006685">Hi group!<br/>
<br/>
I have been watching this discussion ping pong back<br/>
and forth and I just want to say that both points are<br/>
valid.<br/>
<br/>
On the one hand, surveys are crap. What do I care<br/>
about other people&#39;s misconceptions and so called<br/>
expert opinions?<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, publicity and politics are<br/>
important matters; much of the homeschooling movement<br/>
has indeed been a political struggle.<br/>
<br/>
Just google the history of that homeschool legal<br/>
defense organization....<br/>
<br/>
It is important to remember that the choices we make<br/>
in carving alternative educational niches for our<br/>
children is a political act and we are, whether we<br/>
like it or not, part of a movement that IS political<br/>
in nature.<br/>
<br/>
I homeschool in protest of mainstream cultural values<br/>
that are amplified and exacerbated in a school<br/>
setting. I don&#39;t know that the call to homeschool<br/>
would be so strong if schools, in their current<br/>
incarnation, weren&#39;t so opposite of my philosophy,<br/>
including my political philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
If public schools functioned as they ought to in a<br/>
true democracy-which is to ensure a well-educated<br/>
public that is capable and empowered enough to shape<br/>
government in the ways most beneficial to the greatest<br/>
number of people-then maybe we wouldn&#39;t be a nation<br/>
plagued as we are with rampant corruption and<br/>
corporate influenceon public policy. The fact that<br/>
schools produce more &quot;schooled&quot; people than &quot;educated&quot;<br/>
ones is a threat to the health of our country.<br/>
<br/>
I homeschool to provide my daughter with an education<br/>
that I don&#39;t believe she would receive in a<br/>
traditional setting-that I could afford, anyway. For<br/>
me, homeschooling is a patriotic act.<br/>
<br/>
It is worth considering the fact that what we do<br/>
safegaurds an important right-one to educate as one<br/>
sees fit-and to live by example for the sake of not<br/>
only our families, but other families as well. Many<br/>
people do not have this option on their radar-they<br/>
accept the inevitablity that school is the only choice<br/>
for their children whether or not the local public<br/>
school is good and whether or not they have the cash<br/>
to shell out to a more benign institution.<br/>
<br/>
Many more might feel empowered enough to follow our<br/>
example if they knew more about what homeschooling is<br/>
all about. One sided perspectives in the media don&#39;t<br/>
help this situation.<br/>
<br/>
I think, therefore, that public opinion is important,<br/>
even in the sensationalist guise of a silly on-line<br/>
survey and that perhaps our voice is one that should<br/>
be heard in the context of a vigorous national debate<br/>
on education and educational reform.<br/>

<br/>
More unschoolers are looking at that article than anyone else, I&#39;m  <br/>
sure.  It&#39;s old.  The water has run under the bridge.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Just google the history of that homeschool legal<br/>

<br/>
No, don&#39;t.<br/>
Unschool with confidence without thinking that other people&#39;s  <br/>
politics and online articles will make or break your freedom.<br/>
<br/>
-=-It is important to remember that the choices we make<br/>
in carving alternative educational niches for our<br/>
children is a political act and we are, whether we<br/>

<br/>
But this list is NOT political in nature.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I homeschool in protest of mainstream cultural values<br/>

<br/>
If your reason to unschool is not about how learning works, maybe  <br/>
this list isn&#39;t a good fit for you.  If you can&#39;t keep politics on  <br/>
political lists and natural learning on this list, you&#39;re welcome to  <br/>
stay here if you try a little harder to follow the stated purpose of  <br/>
the list.<br/>
<br/>
-=-think, therefore, that public opinion is important,<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s really easy to start a yahoo or google group.  You can advertise  <br/>
it on this one if you want to break off and make a list about how  <br/>
important a political stance is when unschooling.<br/>

It turned out we had people from all over the world, The Danish Skydive Team, Germany, Austraila to name the ones I remember.<br/>
My favorite person of the night was an unschooling 12yo boy.  I told him he looked like a surfer, all he needed was the board.  He smiled and said.&quot;I got one!&quot;  He played the theme song from Charlie Brown on our piano and told me he is going snowboarding in Germany this year.  So I asked him where he surfs.  He said Costa Rica.  Wow.<br/>
