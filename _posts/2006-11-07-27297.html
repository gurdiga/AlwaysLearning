<br/>
Hi.<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I have two boys ages 6.5 and 4.5. We live in Los Angeles. I have known <br/>
since our oldest was 1 that I wanted to try homeschooling. In putting homeschooling into <br/>
practice for our family, I have come to realize the beauty and merits of unschooling. I <br/>
believe in it whole-heartedly in theory. I&#39;m having a little difficulty these days believing it <br/>
in practice! :-)<br/>
<br/>
My basic challenges (and forgive me if this becomes long-winded): Finding a balance <br/>
between what they want and need and what I want and need. Unschooling appeals to me <br/>
in many ways, the biggest one being the freedom it offers. Our schedule is our own. The <br/>
world is our oyster. This (theoretically) offers the potential, time and freedom to find other <br/>
like-minded people and to create a community: attend various park days (there are many <br/>
to choose from in Los Angeles!), try classes, explore. I like meeting new people and I am <br/>
fed by being with people who ask some of the same questions I ask, think in a similar way, <br/>
challenge themselves in a similar way (who doesn&#39;t?). As a homeschooling parent, I seek <br/>
local community for support. I/we are in the minority having chosen this unschooling <br/>
lifestyle. And it helps me  especially when I&#39;m doubting our choices, feeling lonely and <br/>
vulnerable because our &quot;alternative lifestyle&quot;  to know there are others out there seeking <br/>
the same things and often struggling with the same things. So, I would love to attend park <br/>
days regularly, meet more homeschooling families, find a community, create a broader <br/>
range of kids my children can play with, make friends that can be there when I have <br/>
questions, need to hash something out about homeschooling/unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
My kids on the other hand like the friends they already have (most of their friends go to <br/>
school). They have no interest in meeting new people, no interest in park days or <br/>
homeschooling field trips and outings. They like being home for the most part and usually <br/>
&quot;complain&quot; when we have to go anywhere, even if it&#39;s just to the grocery store for milk. I <br/>
like being home, too. I can always find stuff to do here and we have a good time together. <br/>
But I need more, and they don&#39;t seem to.<br/>
<br/>
There are countless opportunities in our general area: classes, outings, meetings, parties. I <br/>
usually chomp at the bit to attend. My kids put their foot/feet down and say, &quot;No.&quot; Or, <br/>
they agree to try something but when the day comes, they change their minds and just <br/>
want to stay home. I have on occasion &quot;dragged&quot; them to events and sometimes they are <br/>
pleasantly surprised at how much fun they had, and other times they are bored or <br/>
uncomfortable and want to leave. They seem to remember the latter times more. And our <br/>
outings are so few and far between that the kids have yet to form bonds with other <br/>
homeschool kids. Our oldest attends a science class for homeschoolers once/week and he <br/>
likes it. But he doesn&#39;t seek out any of the kids outside of the class. Just today I asked if he <br/>
wanted to set up a play time with one of the boys he has had conversations with in class. <br/>
But my son just shrugged his shoulders and said, &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; and walked away.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m frustrated.  I read daily about our local homeschool groups and their park days and <br/>
ideas and plans, and I&#39;m jealous, feel like I&#39;m on the outside looking in at a world I&#39;d love <br/>
to be a part of. I do have confidence that things will change over time and that we will find <br/>
a different groove, one in which we all are more content. They are young and we are still <br/>
finding our way being so new to homeschooling/unschooling. But until then, I&#39;m at a loss.<br/>
<br/>
I have tried speaking with the kids about my frustrations, explaining that I&#39;d like to meet <br/>
more homeschoolers, find friends they like who can play during the day, that I&#39;d like to try <br/>
more classes or outings. But the conversation doesn&#39;t go far as they like things the way <br/>
they are and they can&#39;t seem to vocalize whey they aren&#39;t interested in park days, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I feel like I&#39;m missing out on a richer experience that is waiting to be had. I feel there is <br/>
potential for a more satisfying community but that my kids are a barrier to me/us finding <br/>
that (to them it seems our life is rich enough just the way it is). I want to honor their needs <br/>
and desires. They are more &quot;shy&quot; or &quot;hesitant&quot; than I am and I can understand that park <br/>
days must seem overwhelming to them given they don&#39;t know anyone very well. But <br/>
regularly feel like it&#39;s me who is compromising instead of us finding a win/win for <br/>
everyone. We have a very rich home life. But some days it feels too solitary for my liking <br/>
and I want some outside stimulation, want to hang with homeschooling/unschooling <br/>
families and not strictly school families.<br/>
<br/>
My apologies for the length of this email. I look forward to hearing any ideas (or even just <br/>
empathy :-) anyone has. And thank you in advance!!<br/>

You can use these lists to hash ideas out.<br/>

If your kids don&#39;t WANT to go play and meet people, why would you  <br/>
make them do it?<br/>
<br/>
The most important tool you can have is to be your child&#39;s partner.   <br/>
It&#39;s worth ten playgroups or other families.<br/>

<br/>
If people are going to help you unschooling, the empathy will be for  <br/>
your kids who seem to be expressing clearly that they&#39;re happier at  <br/>
home.  Can your husband do things with them sometimes so you can get  <br/>
out and do something completely unrelated to what they&#39;re doing?<br/>
<br/>
They won&#39;t always be the age they are now.  1) don&#39;t miss it, and 2)  <br/>
don&#39;t think this day or this month will continue for years.  Even  <br/>
this YEAR won&#39;t continue for years.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2129048354">Martha, <br/>
 <br/>
I understand your challenge as I&#39;ve been there myself.  It&#39;s hard when you<br/>
are wanting to be more social than your children want to be.<br/>
 <br/>
What worked for me was for me was changing my focus from what I was missing<br/>
to really being with my children and focusing on what they need now.  It<br/>
makes me happy to have happy kids. It also helps me to remember that I chose<br/>
to have these wonderful children and that I knew that my own needs would<br/>
have to take a back seat for a while.  I cannot believe that my children are<br/>
already 10 and almost 12.  The years have flown by and although I&#39;ve missed<br/>
many park days I don&#39;t regret it one bit because I spent those years<br/>
focusing on their needs and they are whole and happy and wonderful to be<br/>
around.<br/>
 <br/>
Changing my focus helped me but so did finding other ways to socialize.<br/>
Email lists were very helpful in those early days of unschooling when I<br/>
needed the support of other parents who were going through similar things.<br/>
So was talking on the phone and visiting my extended family, which the kids<br/>
usually liked to do.  <br/>
 <br/>
My girls are not quite the home bodies that they once were now that they are<br/>
a little older.  They still love being at home but they also like getting<br/>
out of the house and visiting with their friends  (all of whom are schooled<br/>
children at this point.) and our extended family.  Sometimes for me it&#39;s<br/>
nice just to get out and about if I am feeling stir crazy.  We like to go<br/>
geocaching at times or just get outside and play in the snow or go for a<br/>
walk.<br/>
 <br/>
My social engagements didn&#39;t quite meet the vision I once had in my head of<br/>
a great group of intelligent women who could get together and talk and<br/>
support each other while the kids happily played without a lot of<br/>
intervention but my kids are happy, my social needs are fulfilled enough to<br/>
keep me satisfied, and we continue to meet new people and take advantage of<br/>
the opportunities that present themselves to us by inviting families over<br/>
when the kids do seem to hit it off.  <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1225867640">There are a bunch of things that I like to do that I do less of now that I<br/>
have children. And a bunch of fun things that I do know that I never did<br/>
until I had children. For me, what helped me be happier is focusing on the<br/>
kids -- and pointedly avoiding people/other influences who told me I needed<br/>
more &quot;me time&quot; or implied there was something wrong with focusing on the<br/>
children. Also, thinking about things I&#39;m lacking at this time gets me in a<br/>
funk; focusing on what I have brings peace.<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest bringing the family needs closer together.<br/>
<br/>
a) inviting one family or one individual over at a time -- and not<br/>
necessarily a &quot;matching&quot; family -- someone who *you* want to talk with more.<br/>
b) not discussing it too much with the boys but also not expecting them to<br/>
be &quot;on&quot; in any way.<br/>
c) sign off from some of the local email lists that are dangling all these<br/>
options in front of you!<br/>
<br/>
I also could see your boys enjoying having an older boy come over --<br/>
providing the older boy wanted to. My oldest always really liked playing<br/>
with your kids. I have some specific ideas for families I think your guys<br/>
would really like with some casual exposure! I&#39;ll email you privately.<br/>

Both Simon and Linnaea (to a lesser extent) hate being in groups of new people. It is very intimidating to be the new person in a group made up of already established friendships.

Its kind of like going to a party made up entirely of people only your husband knows, and he doesn&#39;t know them very well. So you have to work to make conversation and it is stressful and you are so tired (or I am so tired--I understand some people thrive off of those sorts of social interactions) when you get home that it was like running a social marathon of sorts. Maybe that is how your two boys feel? <br/>
<br/>
Really what a wonderful thing that your two boys are happy in their lives the way they are. Sometimes I get worried that Simon and Linnaea aren&#39;t spending enough time with other people, and since we&#39;ve just moved it takes a bit more effort to meet up with people.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-158831918">Hello Martha -<br/>
I see some on my own experience in your post so I&#39;d like to <br/>
respond...<br/>
I&#39;m Jane Sutcliffe - 3 kids; 12yo dd; 10yo ds; 8yo ds....  We&#39;ve <br/>
never &#39;schooled&#39;.... I&#39;ve been on and off this list over the last <br/>
several years....<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pulling the following from your email:<br/>
Martha wrote:  &quot;So, I would love to attend park days regularly, meet <br/>
more homeschooling families, find a community, create a broader <br/>
range of kids my children can play with, make friends that can be <br/>
there when I have questions, need to hash something out about <br/>
homeschooling/unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s my guess that you are lonely and would like more contact with <br/>
like-minded adults for ideas and support.  It&#39;s my guess that THAT <br/>
is a very REAL feeling for many people.  I know that I have had lots <br/>
of experience with that.  How can you take care of your needs?  <br/>
Where is your husband in this?<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a pretty picture of you and your kids going to sunny parkday <br/>
events and having a joyous time... you ain&#39;t got that... and you <br/>
don&#39;t get to decide for your kids what they want/need....<br/>
<br/>
So, take care of YOU... &quot;Believing is Seeing&quot;... So, believe you can <br/>
get your needs met and opportunities for you to make that happen <br/>
will arise...<br/>
<br/>
If YOU want to go to park day, then make arrangements for your kids <br/>
at home so YOU can go... IF YOU want community, then create it... <br/>
<br/>
I belive that taking care of ourselves and the process of finding <br/>
creative ways to do so are TREMENDOUS gifts and lessons to our <br/>
children....<br/>
<br/>
The martyr of &quot;Okay, you don&#39;t want to go so we won&#39;t go&quot; or &quot;I <br/>
REALLY want to go but I can&#39;t because you won&#39;t agree to it&quot;, imo, <br/>
creates a victim attitude - a really really poor modelling, imo...<br/>
<br/>
Aside from that, be careful of what you ask for... do some searching <br/>
and be clear....<br/>
<br/>
Is there some &#39;picture&#39; you&#39;re trying to create of the homeschooling <br/>
family you envisioned?<br/>
or is there a need you have for connection and support?<br/>
<br/>
In the family, YOU count, too....<br/>
Imo, it&#39;s easier to say either &quot;it&#39;s MY way&quot; OR &quot;fine, it&#39;s your <br/>
way&quot;....<br/>
The greater difficulty, and imo, the greater gain/gift is in &quot;hmm, <br/>
you have your idea and I have my idea... how can we work it out?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
AND then another aside....<br/>
My 10yo son likes to stay home... has always preferred that....<br/>
What I learned from him...<br/>
<br/>
Why do I feel I need to leave the house to do something or be <br/>
happy?  He is happy every day staying at home.  Why aren&#39;t I?  I had <br/>
a beautiful home, beautiful yard, lots of nice things....what was my <br/>
problem?  What would happen if I copied his simple happiness and <br/>
stayed home for a week?  What could I accomplish?  What could I <br/>
learn from that?  Well, I learned a LOT from that and that&#39;s another <br/>
story... : )<br/>
<br/>
That reminds me of an experiment I did several times about 5 years <br/>
ago, I did a week of not going anywhere (other than taking my kids <br/>
to whatever classes they had), not answering the phone (I did listen <br/>
to messages and briefly return &#39;important calls&#39;), not looking at <br/>
email, and not speaking to my kids until spoken to or only <br/>
if &#39;necessary&#39;...  (I did arrange a playdate for my daughter mid-<br/>
week because that was her preference)....  The last &#39;rule&#39; was in <br/>
response to my inclination to have my interactions be &quot;Look at the <br/>
bird!&quot;  &quot;Lunch is ready.&quot; etc... I wanted to stop interrupting their <br/>
own play, thoughts, etc...  Although I wanted to slow down my/our <br/>
lives, it was not my intent to create stress for them, when I had <br/>
arranged for them to be with friends for one afternoon so I could go <br/>
for a meditative hike and the youngest insisted on going with me, I <br/>
took him along with me...  The kids could call people and I did not <br/>
hold strictly to the &#39;rules&#39;... I gave myself permission to do the <br/>
experiment imperfectly... : )<br/>
<br/>
It was a good week from which I learned a lot... the house was <br/>
quieter and more peaceful.... I found myself thinking, &quot;I don&#39;t have <br/>
anything to do in this house except clean, cook and check emails!  I <br/>
need a hobby!  I need a life!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It also led me to look at the unhappiness in my life... and I&#39;ve <br/>
since made lifestyle changes...  In that week, I had time to be <br/>
quiet and slow.... I think I&#39;ve done it 3 times.... <br/>
<br/>
My son is reading this now and suggests I do it again... : )  <br/>
Perhaps I will...<br/>
<br/>
So, Martha, these are my ramblings in response to your post... <br/>
<br/>
If anything I&#39;ve written speaks to you or is helpful, I&#39;d enjoy <br/>
hearing about it... If not, this is just an exercise for me to <br/>
remind myself to take care of myself...<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes...<br/>
Jane<br/>
P.S. One more thing... I&#39;ve always had a FABULOUS community of like-<br/>
minded adults locally.... I am TREMENDOUSLY lucky with the <br/>
unschooling/homeschooling community here and a community center <br/>
we&#39;ve created... NONETHELESS, I needed time away from them to <br/>
address my own loneliness.... being with them kept me busy and gave <br/>
me a fix to &#39;get by&#39;... taking the time-out from them allowed me to <br/>
look at my life singularly as opposed to going through the motions <br/>
of activities, conversations, etc....  just another 2 cents....<br/>
Good luck!</div>

<br/>
You be a good mom, and you might find that&#39;s what you really needed.<br/>
<br/>
You desire to be partners with your children and you&#39;ll find  <br/>
something you never imagined could have been.<br/>

<br/>
I think the answers to your problem of finding balance may be found  <br/>
there. Especially 1-6 and 12 :)<br/>
