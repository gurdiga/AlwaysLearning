<div id="ygrps-yiv-904019575">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;It reminds me of a story my Mom read my boys<br/>
called &quot;Harris and me&quot; by Gary Paulsen....she has no<br/>
hang ups about poop and pee jokes. In fact she&#39;s<br/>
usually the first to introduce weird, scary, funny and<br/>
rude information to my kids, which they love.In the<br/>
book, one of the boys pees on the electric<br/>
fence....you can imagine the humor in THAT!<br/>
Ren&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That reminds me of a book we have called The Story of<br/>
the Little Mole Who Went in Search of Whodunit by<br/>
Wener Holzwarth and Wolf Erlbruch. It&#39;s a laugh!<br/>

I was surprized it was by Germans, for sure.<br/>
<br/>
We have it too, and it is sweet, educational, and totally about poop <br/>
(although there is a revenge sub-plop... &lt;hee hee&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
I bought it when I went to look for Everyone Poops (or whatever it is) and <br/>
they were out, but the bookseller directed me to this much-better book.<br/>
<br/>
I had a book on the history of toilets, and before I had even finished <br/>
reading it, I loaned it to a hospitalized friend.  His wife ended up giving <br/>
it to Goodwill with some other books. I was grumpy--I&#39;ve never seen another <br/>
copy of it.  I think it was British, too...  <br/>

You would be AMAZED at what some of those Germans get<br/>
up to!<br/>
