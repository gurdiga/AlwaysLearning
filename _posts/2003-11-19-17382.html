Dear Friends,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please take a moment to sign this petition if you believe in state&#39;s rights. The feds are after homeschoolers again. The homeschooling community is very diverse, some very religious, some liberal as all get out... but all agree that the gov needs to butt out of our state law making practices on homeschooling. Please help....send this to people that you think will care and respond. Thank you. Sara<br/>
