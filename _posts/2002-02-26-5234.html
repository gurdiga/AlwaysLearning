<div id="ygrps-yiv-211787487">I finally felt like I was a grown-up when I turned 30-<br/>
I stopped letting my family suck all of my mental and physical energy from me. (extended, not immediate). My mother and grandfather are feuding and my GF &quot;disowned&quot; her- it has been over 2 years now. It was hard to separate myself since I am very close to both parties and live within a mile of each.  BUT- I told them I DID NOT want to discuss the situation with either of them. Put them in shock a bit since I have always been the self-deemed &quot;peacemaker&quot; and &quot;fixer&quot;. I just realized that if they choose to hate each other and be stubborn and not take any blame, they can live with the results- PBLLLTHTTHT (raspberries) howz that for grown-up?<br/>
Mom says I&#39;ve gotten nasty- HEE HEE - that makes me happy to hear. OH yeah- we are planning to move within the next year. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love them all fiercely, I just want to go far enough away so they cannot damage my girls on a daily basis!<br/>
I also found a hidden self-confidence and self-esteem~<br/>
 I LOVED turning 30- wonder how fun 40 will be??<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the therapy.<br/>
