<div id="ygrps-yiv-1096973269">THANK YOU KARIN... OFF TO WALMART IN THE MORNING TO BUY SOME AND GET THOSE<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;We already have a kids rug that they play with cars on so I<br/>
&gt;was thinking about who I know that would lend me one of their rugs to cover<br/>
&gt;up some of the other things that have been spilled on our Berber carpet and<br/>
&gt;will not come out!!!<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I recently learned of an EXCELLENT carpet stain remover.<br/>
It&#39;s called FOLEX Instant Carpet Spot Remover.<br/>
I bought it at Walmart. A big bottle for $4.99.<br/>
It&#39;s non-toxic and has no irritating smell and it really works on even old<br/>
stains. My sister had some stains that she&#39;s been trying to get out for<br/>
years and she tried Folex and it finally did the trick.<br/>
<br/>
Your info-mmercial for the day. :-)<br/>
