<div id="ygrps-yiv-2143264624">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to change my accounts to a new email addy and I&#39;m not doing <br/>
very good so far.<br/>
<br/>
new addy:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:maryfhickman@...">maryfhickman@...</a><br/>
<br/>
so, could someone explain the real way I go about changing my account <br/>
and can someone subscribe me at my new addy? I can unsub myself from <br/>
my old account. All this and I&#39;m nursing my 2 1/2 year old at the same <br/>
time</div>
