<div id="ygrps-yiv-1621521157">Sandra asked:<br/>
&quot; What as the quote a few years back, about &quot;pass the [something]&quot;?<br/>
This is a serious question. I have it vague and it doesn&#39;t seem to be<br/>
on my site, and it should be.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I remembered this phrase as &quot;pass the bean dip&quot;; here is a blog post that<br/>
explores the concept:<br/>

<br/>
I am not sure who originally said it.  If you are looking for a specific<br/>
author to attribute, I googled the phrases &quot;pass the bean dip&quot; and<br/>
&quot;homeschooling&quot; and got a number of hits.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How long is forever though?  I&#39;m truly curious because I always<br/>
attributed that phrase to a particular person at the unschooling boards<br/>
about 7 or 8 yrs ago.  Perhaps that person took the phrase from<br/>
elsewhere.  Or perhaps that phrase was taken elsewhere.  I don&#39;t know<br/>
really.  It&#39;s fun to think about though.</div>

<br/>
It&#39;s the age-old worldwide practice of watching a baby for their signals and<br/>
helping them use a receptacle instead of a diaper. Most people reject it<br/>
based on the idea that a newborn cannot be aware of, let alone signal for<br/>
and control, their eliminations.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny... once it&#39;s proven to you that a newborn can do it, and does<br/>
prefer to be dry and comfy and not wear a diaper... you start to see and<br/>
respect that there are a LOT of things they can do that people either ignore<br/>
willfully or because no one&#39;s taught them to see it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a lot like this list, actually. Once you *see* it, it&#39;s soooooooo<br/>
obvious, and you wonder why everyone doesn&#39;t see it and do it too...<br/>
