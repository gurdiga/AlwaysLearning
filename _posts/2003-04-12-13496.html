<div id="ygrps-yiv-513199333">Zak just told me today was the best day he&#39;s ever had.  This morning he and<br/>
Max (with Steve) went for a playdate at my friend Hilarys&#39;.  She had 3 boys,<br/>
so with 5 of them playing and screaming and running around Steve said it was<br/>
wonderful to see them all together.  Hilary decided to join us this<br/>
afternoon with her 3 boys at the Homeschooling Skating Afternoon.  They all<br/>
had such a good time.  Steve had booked the boys to go to JW Tumbles for 4<br/>
hours where they played on all the jungle gym equipment, watched Chicken<br/>
Run, had pizza, played games and generally had a great time.  Steve and I<br/>
went out to a quiet grown up dinner and to the movies to see Phone Booth<br/>
(which by the way is an excellent movie).. On the way home we rolled all the<br/>
windows down in the car and turned the music up loud (remember it&#39;s AZ we<br/>
live in so it&#39;s about 65 degrees at night).. Zak heard the song from the<br/>
movie Spirit &quot;I&#39;m already there&quot; and we all sat in the garage in the front<br/>
seat with the volume up extra loud and sang the song.  The boys went<br/>
straight to bed and Steve and I are checking out e-mails.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
What a great day they had. and us too..<br/>
