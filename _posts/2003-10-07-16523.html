<div id="ygrps-yiv-1697521154">This is a slightly bizarre question. Julian is taking a course called <br/>
Evolution and Society at Harvard University Extension. He likes the classes, <br/>
especially the optional Discussion section after the regular class. He&#39;s a little bit <br/>
nervous about the papers he needs to write, but we can coach him through it.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s really overwhelmed by the reading, however. There&#39;s lots of it, over 150 <br/>
pages per week, but that&#39;s not the big problem. Right now most of it is <br/>
really boring. It&#39;s 19th century science, and VERY dry. <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any tips for him about how to get through this stuff, and <br/>
how to figure out what NOT to read?  Or just experiences of your own that I can <br/>
pass along to him to reassure him? <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I encouraged him to take a Play Day, and we cuddled on the couch <br/>
and watched &quot;Spirited Away&quot; (AMAZING movie!), and I made him peanut butter and <br/>
fluff on cinnamon bread cut into circles, and Moroccan Mint tea. So I think <br/>
he&#39;ll be ready to face Darwin today. <br/>

Anyway, I&#39;d love to be able to pass any tips along to him. Thanks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1805995835">Hmm -- on  what &quot;not&quot; to read -- does he care what &quot;grade&quot; he gets (if indeed he is getting a grade) and if not -- does he feel (based on what he has read so far and how the class has gone) that his understanding/enjoyment of the class is enhanced by the reading that he is doing?  If neither is true, I say skim through it, read what catches his eye and skip the rest. <br/>
<br/>
I always found it interesting and useful to read the primary sources in the history classes I took because it was a window not merely into *what* they thought, but *how* they thought and how they expected a scientific discourse to be conducted -- but if he just wants/needs to know what Darwin thought about God, or Victorian society, or his fellow passengers on the Beagle, I would think that he could find a good secondary source that would be less dry. <br/>
<br/>
 Some tips I used for getting through especially dry info was read it out loud to someone who was at least slightly interested -- some of that &quot;dry&quot; stuff is quite sonorous and balanced and rolling when read out loud.  Skim it with highlighter in hand, highlighting the key point in each paragraph and then actually &quot;read&quot; only the highlit sections.  Outline the reading as you go along -- for whatever learning style that I am ; )  writing as I go keeps me tethered to the task, otherwise I find that I am  &quot;reading&quot; without ever processing.  <br/>

<br/>
Is the book(s) he is reading a reprint of Darwin&#39;s books or, is the book like <br/>
a regular textbook with chapters and headings under the chapters with little <br/>
blurbs under pictures and those typical shaded boxes with extra details and <br/>
charts in them? If it is like a textbook; read each of the headings under the <br/>
chapter, read the first few sentences or first paragraph and last paragraph, <br/>
read the blurbs and shaded boxes. Review the chapter review at the end of each <br/>
chapter first as well. That way he gets a good overview of the chapter and can <br/>
look for the key points. Right now I am helping a friend of mine who is a <br/>
professor grade tests. She gives essay type tests and they usually consist of five <br/>
or six questions and the class can choose three to answer. When we grade these <br/>
papers the first thing we do is glance over each paper looking for key <br/>
points. We do this because each test turned in can have anywhere from four to six <br/>
pages of essay for each question. That makes for over four hundred pages to <br/>
grade for the whole class. If we see the key points that need to be addressed for <br/>
each question, then we can read more in-depth and grade accordingly. That is <br/>
how I would suggest he approach the reading assignments. Read the chapter <br/>
review at the end of each chapter first, that will give him the key points to look <br/>
for, then go back over the chapter and read for those points. Also, keep notes <br/>
on what the professor lectures on during class and in the discussion time <br/>
after. Then when doing the reading, he can look for those particular nuances of <br/>
the professor. Is there a study group? Maybe he could join that as well. <br/>
Sometimes study groups split the reading between the members. The only problem with <br/>
that is I wouldn&#39;t rely solely on what others have to say about their reading <br/>
assignment, but it is a way to see what/how others view the assignment.<br/>
<br/>
A side note on taking notes; learn to write without vowels as much as <br/>
possible! Tht wy hs nte tkng is qckr & he cn rvw hs own nts fstr! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps!<br/>

<br/>
See if there is a Cliff&#39;s or Monarch&#39;s notes booklet on that.  Then he can <br/>
read the summaries and see which chapters he might REALLY need to read.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I would encourage him to mark in the book, if he owns his own <br/>
copy.  Reselling a book shouldn&#39;t be the primary concern if it&#39;s bought for the <br/>
purposes of taking a course.  What he marks as important or confusing or worth <br/>
remembering or questionable is what he can find quickly on review or to ask <br/>
the teacher.  <br/>
<br/>
He could go online and read other people&#39;s summaries or commentaries on the <br/>
book too.<br/>
<br/>
It seems like more reading, but I don&#39;t think it will be.  It will be <br/>
fluffier. &lt;g&gt; Like peanut butter and fluff and tea, it will be more like life than <br/>
like burial in 19th century text.<br/>
<br/>
Scarier than pirates, trying to read those Stevenson novels.  And at least he <br/>
was TRYING to be entertaining!<br/>

The problem is that the thick, wading-through stuff isn&#39;t Darwin...it&#39;s the <br/>
more obscure people like Lamarck and Paley.<br/>
<br/>
The course is using no textbooks-- just primary sources. The Darwin is a LOT <br/>
easier to read, apparently, so he might be okay here. The really boring stuff <br/>
may be coming to an end. We also pointed out to him that many college students <br/>
DON&#39;T do every bit of the reading, and that he may be able to let some of it <br/>
go, and just back up and read it later if he needs it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Hmm -- on  what &quot;not&quot; to read -- does he care what &quot;grade&quot; he gets (if <br/>
 </span></blockquote>indeed he is getting a grade) and if not -- does he feel (based on what he has <br/>

conducted -- but if he just wants/needs to know what Darwin thought about <br/>
God, or Victorian society, or his fellow passengers on the Beagle, I would think <br/>
that he could find a good secondary source that would be less dry. <br/>
<br/>

to the task, otherwise I find that I am  &quot;reading&quot; without ever processing.  &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think he cares (or has even thought too much about) the grade. He <br/>
needs to learn to skim, and that hasn&#39;t clicked in yet. Maybe THAT&#39;S the skill <br/>
that they&#39;re always talking about school being necessary for! Because up until <br/>
now he&#39;s only had to read things that interested him, and didn&#39;t need to learn <br/>
to skim!!! LOL<br/>
<br/>
The problem isn&#39;t at all his understanding the material. He understands it <br/>
and was able to form a very sophisticated analysis of it in his plan for his <br/>
first paper. (One of those moments when you look at your kid and think &quot;How the <br/>
hell did you figure that out?!&quot;) <br/>
<br/>
You know, the other thing that fascinates me is that he&#39;s truly &quot;getting&quot; the <br/>
material with just one read-through. I suggested that he could mark the <br/>
points he wanted to be sure to remember, etc.-- and he said that it was no problem <br/>
just remembering.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m beginning to see that basically what he needs is to be okay with NOT <br/>
reading every bit ofg assigned reading (particularly since he&#39;s doing the <br/>
Discussion section), and he needs to learn to skim. And I guess sometimes to have his <br/>
Mama make him mint tea and peanut butter and fluff sandwiches. <br/>
<br/>
Thank all of you for your advice!<br/>
