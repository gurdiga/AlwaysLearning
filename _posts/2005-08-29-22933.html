It was an awakening for American writer Steven Johnson - just a hint of the<br/>
educational power of video games. Johnson was whizzing his seven-year-old<br/>
nephew through a tour of SimCity 2000, a top-selling game that allows<br/>
players to build virtual cities on their computers.<br/>
<br/>
It was just a 20-minute introduction - a chance for Johnson to show off<br/>
what he had achieved in building an urban empire. But when he expressed<br/>
frustration at not being able to revive a dilapidated industrial area, the<br/>
youngster&#39;s reply astounded him: &quot;I think you need to lower your industrial<br/>
tax rates.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Reflecting on that years later, Johnson could not help but think that if<br/>
his nephew had been in some urban studies class instead, he would have been<br/>
nodding off. If there was a moment that helped convince him video games can<br/>
enrich young minds, this was one. &quot;He was learning in spite of himself,&quot;<br/>
Johnson says.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com/">http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com/</a>&gt;Johnson went on to write a book that<br/>
dares to suggest that video games are actually good for your kids. Recently<br/>
released in Australia, Everything Bad Is Good for You: How Today&#39;s Popular<br/>
Culture Is Actually Making Us Smarter contends that not only is gaming<br/>
beneficial but so is popular television.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;The most debased forms of mass diversion - video games and violent<br/>
television dramas and juvenile sitcoms - turn out to be nutritional after<br/>
all,&quot; Johnson says in the book.<br/>
<br/>
The writer, who lives in New York, rejects the notion that his beliefs have<br/>
made him public enemy No.1 with parents. &quot;I&#39;ve had a lot of parents come up<br/>
to me and say, &#39;I appreciate this because one of my favourite memories in<br/>
the last couple of years with my kids is sitting around playing Legends of<br/>
Zelda or Sims together for a couple of weeks and it was a really great. It<br/>
was amazing how good they were at the game - and I learned what it is they<br/>
were doing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In the book, and in a piece he wrote for the July issue of the science<br/>
magazine &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.discover.com/">http://www.discover.com/</a>&gt;Discover, he presents the evidence as to<br/>
why video games are not such a bad influence.<br/>
<br/>
He proffers scientific studies carried out over the past decade that show<br/>
gamers can be faster at visual recognition, can condition their brains to<br/>
use less energy and can even be more social, confident and comfortable in<br/>
problem-solving than those who don&#39;t play.<br/>
<br/>
Johnson is such a believer in the enriching powers of video games that he&#39;d<br/>
like to see them come with a &quot;cognitive challenge&quot; rating alongside ratings<br/>
for violence and language so parents are advised on their mental stimulation.<br/>
<br/>
Video games have come under intense scrutiny after a gamer discovered the<br/>
popular title Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas contains hidden sex scenes.<br/>
However, these are only accessible after downloading and installing<br/>
separate computer code. The episode led to<br/>
&lt;<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://smh.com.au/news/breaking/popular-game-pulled-from-sale/2005/07/29/1122144013522.html">http://smh.com.au/news/breaking/popular-game-pulled-from-sale/2005/07/29/1122144013522.html</a>&gt;an<br/>
outright ban of the sale of the game in Australia and an adults-only R<br/>
rating in the US.<br/>
<br/>
The game was already well known for its crime-and-prostitution-riddled<br/>
themes and for the violence that pervades its scenes. But Johnson dismisses<br/>
the debate over games inciting violence and aggression among young people<br/>
by arguing they have led to a decrease in violent juvenile crime.<br/>
<br/>
As evidence, he cites the Child Well-Being Index prepared by sociologists<br/>
at Duke University in North Carolina. The latest index, released in March,<br/>
shows violent crime amongst teens and adolescents in the US has plunged by<br/>
almost two-thirds since 1975 - to less than 10 juveniles per 1000 people.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If you look just at something like Grand Theft Auto - the primary crime<br/>
you commit in GTA is car jacking, right? You run in and throw somebody out<br/>
of their car and you jump in their car. And since Grand Theft Auto came<br/>
out, car jacking has dropped in half,&quot; he says.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We talk about crimes like car jacking as thrill crimes, right? People are<br/>
doing it not because they have any kind of dire economic need but because<br/>
they are showing off - jumping into a car and intimidating someone and<br/>
throwing them out and racing around in a car. And it is entirely possible<br/>
that kids now get those thrills from video games.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;They don&#39;t need to actually carjack people the way that they needed to 10<br/>
or 15 years ago because the games are so accurate in their simulations. So<br/>
it may well be that video games function as a kind of a safety valve - they<br/>
let kids who would otherwise be doing violent things for the thrill of it<br/>
get out those kind of feelings sitting at home at a screen.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Jane Healy, an educational psychologist in Colorado, is much more wary.<br/>
Healy isn&#39;t against video games but she is concerned about overuse and an<br/>
increasing reliance on computers in schools. The author of Failure to<br/>
Connect: How Computers Affect Our Children&#39;s Minds, she argues that<br/>
children have to be supervised properly both at home and at school to make<br/>
sure they are, indeed, learning and don&#39;t fall into dangerous territory.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The bottom line is parents have to be on top of this. This is not a benign<br/>
technology. You are sending your kids out into what is a potentially bad<br/>
neighbourhood when you let them use a computer, and it is up to you to make<br/>
sure they don&#39;t wander into the wrong places and do the wrong things,&quot; she<br/>
says.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;These are questions that have never before been considered by parents.<br/>
Today&#39;s parents are the pioneers. The kids are the ones that are going to<br/>
suffer the outcome. There is a cardinal rule to be developed here: it&#39;s to<br/>
be cautious - this could be dangerous stuff; it can also be useful. It is<br/>
up to you to try to draw the line.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The problem for avid believers such as Johnson is that the research has yet<br/>
to be done to support his theory or look at what other benefits games and<br/>
simulations can bring to youngsters. &quot;This is this wonderful, mostly<br/>
unexplored area of research: are the lessons learned carried over into the<br/>
real world?&quot; says Mark Pesce, a lecturer of interactive media at the<br/>
Australian Film Television and Radio School and author of<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://playfulworld.com/">http://playfulworld.com/</a>&gt;The Playful World: How Technology is Transforming<br/>
Our Imagination.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We train pilots in simulations so they can carry those lessons over into<br/>
the real world. We even train army personnel in simulations so they can<br/>
carry those lessons over to the real world. Are our children carrying those<br/>
lessons over into the real world? That&#39;s an open question. I don&#39;t think<br/>
anybody knows the answer to that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
James Paul Gee, a pioneer in video-game research at the University of<br/>
Wisconsin, says the field is still so new nobody can prove anything. &quot;It<br/>
shows that games can improve your problem solving. There is well-known<br/>
research that they improve surgeons&#39; hand-eye co-ordination and skills in<br/>
surgery,&quot; he says.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;There is research that we have collected that it is good for language<br/>
acquisition early in school because so many of the games, especially games<br/>
like Pokemon, involve very complex language.&quot; The author of What Video<br/>
Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy adds: &quot;But it is a new<br/>
field so proof right now is a very strong word - nobody can prove anything.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Still, the ideas are moving forward. Since 2002, researchers at the<br/>
Massachusetts Institute of Technology have been spearheading an effort<br/>
dubbed Education Arcade to study the educational benefits of games and to<br/>
develop games for schools.<br/>
<br/>
As well as looking at the education use of popular games such as The Sims<br/>
and Civilization, the group has developed its own games to test on<br/>
middle-school students - science games with names such as Virus and<br/>
Supercharged!<br/>
<br/>
Eric Klopfer, one of the researchers, was not sure the students would be<br/>
able to grasp the science lessons within the games but &quot;the fact that it is<br/>
through a video game makes it a bit more accessible to them and a little<br/>
bit more eager for them to try out.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Elyssebeth Leigh, a senior lecturer at the University of Technology,<br/>
Sydney, believes in the power of video games, too. She says they teach<br/>
children how to interact with technology. And they can help children<br/>
experiment with the world around them in a safe way - and learn about<br/>
choices, strategy, risks and consequences without leaving the living room.<br/>
<br/>
Leigh, who is also general secretary of the International Simulation and<br/>
Gaming Association (www.isaga.info), says parents should take the time to<br/>
talk to their children about the games they choose and why they choose them.<br/>
<br/>
Wired for school<br/>
<br/>
Video games, aka computer simulations, are widely used at<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cherrybrok-h.schools.nsw.edu.au">http://www.cherrybrok-h.schools.nsw.edu.au</a>&gt;Cherrybrook Technology High<br/>
School, in northern Sydney. Students use simulations to learn about<br/>
everything from how a plane flies to the intricacies of artificial<br/>
intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
It is not an unusual sight to walk into a classroom and see them engaged in<br/>
a flight simulator, a chess game or even programming a computer to bring to<br/>
life gaming concepts from their own imaginations.<br/>
<br/>
James Laird, head of IT at the school, says learning through the computer<br/>
is a natural fit for students today. &quot;There is an ease of learning and<br/>
degree of comfort that they get out of it. Given that this is a tool in the<br/>
environment that they live with these days, it is not something they have<br/>
to think about - they just do it,&quot; he says.<br/>
<br/>
But just because the students are engaged in simulations at school doesn&#39;t<br/>
mean the lessons are all fun and games. The students are expected to study<br/>
the theories and details behind what is unfolding on the screen.<br/>
<br/>
In the chess game they are expected to study the strategies of chess and<br/>
deduce whether the computer is relying on textbook moves in its matches<br/>
against human players or acting on its own.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;They are having a look at artificial intelligence: is the computer really<br/>
thinking or is the computer responding using predefined strategies?&quot; Laird<br/>
says.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Is it adapting to the game, finding out one strategy isn&#39;t working and<br/>
switching over to another strategy to counter what you are doing?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Laird says that other schools are catching on to simulations as teaching<br/>
tools as well.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The first known graphics-based computer game was invented in 1952 at the<br/>
University of Cambridge. A man named A.S. Douglas created a computerised<br/>
version of tic-tac-toe called OXO as part of his thesis on human-computer<br/>
interaction.<br/>
