Pawlenty pitches paying &#39;super teachers&#39; up to $100,000<br/>
Let&#39;s assume for the sake of discussion that homeschooling is not a <br/>
possibility for many familes, okay?<br/>
<br/>
This summer my son and I had the amazing opportunity to hear Jonathan Kozol, <br/>
author of &quot;Savage Inequalities&quot; speak. His book is about the differences in <br/>
education opportunities between rich suburbs (where mostly white people live) <br/>
and innercity (where mostly brow people live) schools. He described being at a <br/>
party in a rich suburb and having conversations with wealthy people who either <br/>
send their children to expensive private schools or ensure that they live in <br/>
suburbs that offer their children excellent opportunities with plenty of <br/>
learning materials, well-paid teachers, etc. And heard them ask, over and over, &quot;Do <br/>
you really think more money would make a difference?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
His response: &quot;You certainly seem to think so.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What would happen if the best, proven, and best paid teachers in a given <br/>
state were sent, along with other funding and materials, to the poorest districts <br/>
with the children who had the least home support? Of course it&#39;s not a <br/>
shoe-in...but it couldn&#39;t hurt.<br/>
