<div id="ygrps-yiv-1021031062">I&#39;ll repeat what I wrote a few days ago:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I would say the Petz games (Dogz and Catz), and Nintendogs<br/>
(from my daughter&#39;s experience) are good for non- or beginning<br/>
readers. I hear that  My Little Pony, Sonic Rush, and some Disney<br/>
games are good, too.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If your daughter likes Mario Kart and Lego Star Wars, there are  <br/>
corresponding DS games that she should be able to navigate without too  <br/>
much reading.<br/>
<br/>
One of the ways my daughter learned to read was playing computer and  <br/>
DS games :-)<br/>

Right and if she likes any of the Mario games, the nice thing about them is that <br/>
they retain their value.  Once she gets bored of it she can trade it for other <br/>

It would enhance ANYone&#39;s hand/eye coordination, even people with no<br/>
Asperger&#39;s or syndromes and even an adult! I type way better than I used to<br/>
due to being online writing.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a great post on why it is good to not think much if at all and<br/>
certainly not talk in terms of labels like what syndrome someone has (<br/>

Like saying I have chronic fatigue syndrome (which I don&#39;t have.. it&#39;s just<br/>
an example of something I *could* say about myself) when things slow up for<br/>
me. I used to say something about myself that&#39;s true but not necessarily<br/>
always or even often connected with a condition, except the condition of<br/>
being myself.. me. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2075149008">The Petz games are great and so is Nintendogs. There is a Crayola game<br/>
we&#39;ve had fun with also - there is a &quot;story&quot; you can play or you can<br/>
just color. Elite Beat Agents is silly & fun - you tap circles to the<br/>
beat of the music. The art style is similar to comic books and looks<br/>
great.<br/>
<br/>
I really recommend gamefly.com (like Netflix, but for video games). I<br/>
think their most basic plan is $16.99/month for one game out at a<br/>
time. It is a great way to try games. It is for almost all systems<br/>
too!<br/>

for the child. That helps with learning to read as well as playing the game,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-11408505">I would suggest Scribblenauts for DS. The game requires the player to use different objects for solving problems. In order to obtain the object, the player has to type its name into the game. My step-daughter is now 7, but she liked playing this game even before she could read. The way she played it then was to ask me to write for her a list of names of things she wants to use on a paper and then she would type them in. These things were usually something like unicorn, princess, spaceship, mermaid, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Since your daughter is more independent and likes to do things on her own, I&#39;d suggest getting her a picture dictionary which would give her easy access to spellings of things she wants to use in the game. Even without solving he puzzles, the main menu screen is also interactive and she can free play with the things she types in. It&#39;s lots of fun even for adults. <br/>
