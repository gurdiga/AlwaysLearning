<div id="ygrps-yiv-219350726">Hi<br/>
<br/>
I know Sandra lives in NM, who else?<br/>
<br/>
Alexx and I (and Janene) will be in the Alb/Jemez/Los Alamos area August 3-9th, and Janene will be there from July 21st to the 9th of August.  I would like to meet up with some other homeschoolers, maybe at a park day?  <br/>
