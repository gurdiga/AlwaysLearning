&gt; selfish.&quot; (might not be exact words, but 95% right, if I&#39;ve forgotten a <br/>
&gt; little; <br/>
&gt; &quot;selfish&quot; and  the idea that it was for me and not Kirby were in there).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&quot;ve run up against this way of thinking some too - I decided I do/did <br/>
homeschool for my benefit.  I try to do my best with everything that comes my way in <br/>
life.  Mothering is/was a BIG part of my life and to do the very best in that <br/>
role, I un/homeschooled.  People that have a problem with that are dealing <br/>
with their own issues - and our choices threaten them.  That is sad.<br/>
<br/>
On the sport deal - I second the posting to look up the rules, and make sure <br/>
the the school you are working with can help you.<br/>
