<div id="ygrps-yiv-388019718">I came across a book in the library the other day called &quot;Great Books <br/>
about Things Kids Love&quot;.  There are over 750 recommendations for <br/>
children ages 3 to 14 divided into 57 categories.<br/>
<br/>
What a great book. I found many many books in it that I thought my <br/>
girls would love.<br/>
