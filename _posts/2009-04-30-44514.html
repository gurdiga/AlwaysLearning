<div id="ygrps-yiv-1815652912">i was just looking around this groups many splendor & noticed photo albums... <br/>
<br/>
re. the handwriting album...was that for handwriting analysis? i have always found it fascinating. i have noticed that i type in what i thought was a lazy style...now i am going to positive label that as &#39;convenient&#39; and &#39;fast&#39;. people can still read/understand my words so why capitalize. i&#39;m a rebel that way. <br/>
<br/>
i have also noticed that when i handwrite i will capitilize &quot;I&quot; when i refer to myself... but use a lower case &#39;i&#39; in my words, including &#39;it&#39; or any &quot;i&#39;s that are in my first or last name... (which i have). but i do not capitilize my &#39;i&#39; when i refer to myself as i type.<br/>
<br/>
also when i handwrite my handwriting is pretty upwrite and a combo of cursive and print... very creative looking. other people think it is virtually unlegible...as i get older (i&#39;m now 38) i cannot even read a lot of what i handwrote... LOL<br/>
<br/>
is anyone interested in this handwriting analysis stuff...the books i&#39;ve got on this subject don&#39;t seem to give me enough of the answers i seek.<br/>
<br/>
i have another question (as i&#39;m full of questions...) but it is unrelated to handwriting so please excuse the multiple &#39;ellinghamsandwich&#39; postings today...<br/>

to use allcaps print instead of cursive writing?  I heard of it in <br/>

<br/>
I wrote in lowercaps too, Lis, when I first starting typing a lot <br/>
online and then I eventually switched back over.. maybe my speed was <br/>
satisfactory enough and I wanted to see the regular stuff after a <br/>
while.<br/>

Not all caps, but printing instead of cursive.   I think it&#39;s in  <br/>
Learning All the Time (not sure).<br/>

punctuation. She does not write anything in cursive and is often hard- <br/>
pressed to print. But, she printed her name for her passport all in  <br/>
caps and it was accepted as her signature.<br/>
