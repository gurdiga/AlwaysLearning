&lt;&lt;&lt;In a way this may come as a bit of a rant, but it really is a <br/>
frustration point for me.I have been in AP groups for years, been on <br/>
discussion lists and in full support of the Continuum Concept. All of <br/>
these things are still things I believe in,meeting the needs of the <br/>
baby, sling wearing, breast feeding on demand,family bed and so on. <br/>
<br/>
The problem I find is as the kids grow from babies into children,they <br/>
become very different people. Most of the AP kids I know are quite <br/>
horrible to be around. They whine, they hit, they call siblings and <br/>
parets names. The parents will tell the child they don&#39;t like the <br/>
behavior and try to reason with them,but nothing changes. I know <br/>
there was always this feeling that if you did &quot;everything right&quot;, <br/>
there would be no unmet needs and therefore no need to discpline.If <br/>
you were 100% connected with your child the would automatically want <br/>
to please you by complying to a reasonable request.It is something I <br/>
have read about in Bushmen, but I have never seen in real life. <br/>
<br/>
In real life these kids are obnoxoius and the parents have no way to <br/>
influence their behavior to change.They do modeling,and verbal <br/>
resoning,but this is often ignored. I have read on the unschooling <br/>
list where the parents write that they &quot;just don&#39;t allow&quot; kids to be <br/>
violent , swear at them or destroy things.They write that they <br/>
will &quot;do what it takes&quot; to stop destructive behavior, but nobody has <br/>
said exactly what it is that they will do. Will you physically <br/>
restrain? Will you hit that child? What do you do when you stand in <br/>
between fighting siblings and they don&#39;t stop? How is this so <br/>
different than being punitive? Is it better to have a physical or <br/>
verbal fight with your child when they are now in a rage and so are <br/>
you? What about when they are bigger? What if they win,do you then <br/>
have to call the police like you would if an adult started acting so <br/>
wild?   <br/>
It seems there is either permissive parenting where even if you state <br/>
your dislike of a behvior you have no way to enforce it. It&#39;s <br/>
comepletely up to weather the child wants to please you or not.Or the <br/>
opposition which is authoritarian parenting,not consensual,and you <br/>
are able to keep your authority.<br/>

<br/>
To me, the difficulty with these sorts of statements is that &#39;the children I know&#39; aren&#39;t really that many children. it&#39;s like the judgments unschoolers may get - how many unschoolers do people really know to be able to fairly judge.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing is that children aren&#39;t perfect beings just because they&#39;re treated a certain way. In my opinion, that&#39;s not what we are raising our children to be. <br/>
<br/>
In my situation though, I see the opposite. Chidlren who are treated with respect, equal to that respect that adults are given,  are respectful children. Of course we all have our days. Bigger group dynamics often seem to be times when I notice play being abit more tricky for some kids (and adults!). Times when children have to do things they&#39;d really rather not be doing like: shopping, waiting for longish periods of time, having only adults around with no children to interact with, and also when they are tired or hungry, or thirsty or sick or cold.<br/>
<br/>
Putting your opinion on what things &#39;look&#39; like without really looking at what&#39;s happening for individual children to cause some of the behaviours is often when people judge certain parenting styles unfairly. I think that those judegments are based on a lack of connecting with children&#39;s needs the way adults seem to be able to connect with adult needs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-892590717">I agree about sample size, but, at the same time, I know my son at 3.5 can<br/>
do a lot of those things - he certainly hits some and is a general PITA a<br/>
lot :)<br/>
<br/>
But my goal is to raise a self-reliant, loving adult, not to raise a<br/>
self-reliant 3/4/5/x-year old.  Naomi Aldort said somewhere that children<br/>
will act like adults when they&#39;re....adults.  I really like to remind myself<br/>
of that.  A lot of mainstream kids ARE &quot;better behaved&quot; when they&#39;re young.<br/>
The point is that I don&#39;t want my son to behave that way out of fear of<br/>
getting yelled at or some other negative repercussion.  And these<br/>
&quot;well-behaved&quot; kids are the same ones who later steal their parents&#39; whiskey<br/>
to refill with water (Sandra&#39;s recent example).<br/>

<br/>

need imput and guidance from parents- unschooling  is not taking care of<br/>
their needs as babies and then letting the fend for themselves for the<br/>

3 I would pick her up and take her away from the situation- let her<br/>
scream and then hold her- somtimes she just needed to release the energy<br/>
<br/>
but with my now 3 yr old when she was 2 she would be more physically<br/>
violent and I would stop her from doing it by saying stop or taking her<br/>
arm- the difference was I did not then spank her or send her to time<br/>
out- she would also throw everything in sight on the foor and so I<br/>
learned to move really fast and get their first and say NO- part of the<br/>
key is not more limits but getting them what they needed- she needed to<br/>
explore the world jumping climbing checking stuff out and I had to find<br/>
a way to say yes and keep her safe- she is so much more mellow a year<br/>
later<br/>

It&#39;s<br/>

 </span></blockquote>a lot of times my girls say NO- they do not want to help clean up toys<br/>
or clean the house BUT they became very good at running to get something<br/>
for the other when they were hurt- the compassion the have (when not<br/>
fighting) for each other is amazing to see-  they say yes and no and<br/>
will sometimes do things with me helping them<br/>

REALLY work- if you have authority does it mean that your child will<br/>
NEVER disobey never hide something- never lie and sneak to get out of<br/>
trouble-<br/>

was.  It&#39;s Associated Press.  Associated Press had it before anyone  <br/>
else (and it&#39;s probably other things in other countries).<br/>
<br/>
-=-If  you were 100% connected with your child the would  <br/>
automatically want to please you by -=-<br/>
<br/>
Not &quot;automatically.&quot;  Out of regard and respect and love.  Maybe she  <br/>
knows families going through the motions without having real respect  <br/>
and regard for the children.<br/>
<br/>
Was it this list where someone asked about a child who was &quot;hitting  <br/>
mommy&quot;?  The question about age wasn&#39;t answered, and the topic kind  <br/>
went away (I wouldn&#39;t mind if it came back), but my first thought was  <br/>
that a mother shouldn&#39;t refer to herself as &quot;mommy.&quot;    It&#39;s not  <br/>
normal communication, to refer to oneself in third person.   If with  <br/>
other people I say &quot;I did [whatever] and please let me know...&quot; but  <br/>
to my children I say &quot;Mommy did this for you, so please let mommy  <br/>
know...&quot; those kids will know they&#39;re being baby-talked.<br/>
<br/>
There was a mom in our La Leche League group that baby-talked her  <br/>
child, who treated him like a cotton ball, in front of other people.   <br/>
She would be normal and turn to him and turn soft and weird, and turn  <br/>
back and be normal.  So though she surely considered that she was  <br/>
including him by his being there, he was spoken to in another mode,  <br/>
in a separate way.  He was clearly NOT part of the people in the  <br/>
group.  He was special and separate.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my only guess, in light of the new story brought here.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1659095281">Hi all,<br/>
this thread got my attention becos i posted this on another list which<br/>
was discussing the same issue:<br/>
&lt;&lt;my ds(4) kicked his grandma today and i was mortified. i know the<br/>
causes: he was hungry (but we were just outside the pie shop and about<br/>
to walk in the door to get food), and he had just pulled his sister&#39;s<br/>
(play)wig off and she had responded with a couple of punches so he was<br/>
already &quot;wound up&quot;. i can&#39;t remember exactly why he kicked grandma.<br/>
my mum (grandma) was fine about it altho it hurt a lot.<br/>
my children can be very &quot;vicious&quot; and &quot;violent&quot; with each other (about<br/>
2% of the time) and i have tried some of the ideas ppl have suggested<br/>
on here, but what do i do after the event as it were? i talked with<br/>
them both about the hitting and the kicking, and used the idea i&#39;ve<br/>
used before, from sandra dodd, about them going to jail if they were<br/>
adults. then i said i&#39;d had enough and was going to start taking toys<br/>
off them if it kept happening (my idea not sandra&#39;s). i know this not<br/>
the right way to go about it, but what do i do?? my ds also hit me<br/>
later for not getting him some crisps when he&#39;d chosen an ice-cream,<br/>
so of course i thought i had to carry thru and i said i would take<br/>
away his cap.<br/>
i know this is not the right way to deal with it and they are<br/>
brilliant together a lot of the time.<br/>
any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.&gt;&gt;<br/>
-one of the &quot;answers&quot; from the other list was that the reader of my<br/>
post was horrified that i should talk about jail with my children and<br/>
she would never do that...............????????so i am now confused!! <br/>

and carry him out - as gently as possible, but firmly.<br/>
<br/>
Parents talk and talk but are seldom very clear. Think now about what  <br/>
you&#39;ll do next time. Think of what you really want to say and say it  <br/>
in just 3 or 4 words.<br/>
<br/>
And pay more attention to what is happening right before the violence  <br/>
- THAT is when you really need to intervene.<br/>
<br/>
So - make a plan. Maybe just before things get violent, the kids get a  <br/>
little loud. Or maybe there is a certain tone of voice you recognize.  <br/>
Next time the signals start to appear - you have a plan. You&#39;re going  <br/>
to, for example, jump in with a joke: &quot;Hey - guess what?&quot; &quot;What?&quot;  <br/>
&quot;That&#39;s what!&quot;  ANything to break up the tension. Just one idea - you  <br/>
have to think up what might be distracting for your own kids.<br/>
<br/>
Imagine if your husband or a good friend had a little too much to  <br/>
drink and was behaving in a way that you&#39;re sure would embarrass him  <br/>
if wasn&#39;t drunk. Might you step in to kind of guide him back to better  <br/>
behavior? Maybe intervene if you saw some problem developing?  Do your  <br/>
kid the same favor.<br/>

Well it WAS an answer, not an &quot;answer.&quot;  You asked for help/ideas,  <br/>
and people gave them.  Same here, same anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone here is saying &quot;Do what I say or I&#39;ll take away  <br/>
your cap.&quot;  It&#39;s &quot;Here&#39;s what I did, here&#39;s why...&quot; and then from all  <br/>
the answers you can find anywhere in the world, and from the voices  <br/>
in your head (messages you&#39;ve internalized through your life one way  <br/>
or another), you sort through and think and do what YOU will do.<br/>
<br/>
When I was first was learning ballads I was 14, nearly 15.  I would  <br/>
learn one and LOVE it, and the newest was always my favorite, and I  <br/>
was thrilled to know these pieces of history.  Then I would hear  <br/>
another version of the same ballad and be disturbed--sometimes  <br/>
distraught, that now mine wasn&#39;t IT, the &quot;real one.&quot;  But that&#39;s what  <br/>
makes ballads wonderful, is that each is one of a larger family of  <br/>
traditional ballads.<br/>
<br/>
By the time I was 17 or 18, I started loving finding more ballads.   <br/>
But here&#39;s what helped (besides just age and maturity):  Finding the  <br/>
*third* version.<br/>
<br/>
When there were two, it seemed like I had to choose one and reject  <br/>
the other.  When there were three, or four or five, it became a  <br/>
collection.  Sometimes I could choose one or the other depending on  <br/>
the audience.  SCA/medieval event?   Singing for 12 year olds in the  <br/>
classroom?  A party with other folksingers?  Different  <br/>
considerations, different choices.  I know two versions of Matty  <br/>
Grove all the way through.  One is fast and one&#39;s very slow and a  <br/>
little monotonous, but more effective if the audience is in the mood  <br/>
for a serious dramatic ballad.   One of the best preserved and oldest  <br/>
ballads I know, that I got from tradition directly (from Beth  <br/>
VanOver, Jean Ritchie&#39;s cousin, from one of their older uncles) has  <br/>
wonderful lyrics but sounds like cowboy music.  That&#39;s not a problem,  <br/>
musicologically.  But I don&#39;t sing it at SCA events because it  <br/>
doesn&#39;t &quot;evoke the period.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Blah blah blah, but that&#39;s all to say that living by principle isn&#39;t  <br/>
the same as living by a set of rules.  It seems the same at first.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I would never have a rule about what I would and wouldn&#39;t talk to my  <br/>
children about, because I talk to them as people.  I&#39;m not working  <br/>
from a script.  I think that it&#39;s dishonest NOT to tell a child at  <br/>
some point that he does NOT have the right to act anyway his mother  <br/>
will allow him to act.  Historically, some people&#39;s mothers have  <br/>
encouraged them to murder and rob.  That didn&#39;t keep them from being  <br/>
imprisoned or shot by police.<br/>

didn&#39;t want their grandma to think you thought it appropriate  <br/>
behavior and 2) you wanted your words to end the behavior.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than focusing on their problem you turned them into the  <br/>
problem. Kids who are in the midst of needing something and lack the  <br/>
power or understanding of how to get it -- and sometimes don&#39;t even  <br/>
know what they want! -- are not the most receptive to ideas  about  <br/>
*your* problems ;-)<br/>
<br/>
As Pam suggested, being aware of what leads up to something like this  <br/>
is huge.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
You were feeling powerless and chose to take even more power from  <br/>
beings who have little power to begin with.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect he was tired or stressed or *something*. He needed  <br/>
something and may not even have known what it was. It was his way of  <br/>
communicating that.<br/>
<br/>
Get to him *before* he needs to resort to such over the top tactics  <br/>
to get your attention.<br/>
<br/>
It won&#39;t eliminate it all but you&#39;ll get better at avoiding  <br/>
situations the better you get at being mindful of their needs before  <br/>
they&#39;re even aware they have needs ;-) (And, in the meantime, they&#39;ll  <br/>
get older and better at understanding themselves and better at using  <br/>
better tools to communicate.)<br/>

<br/>
I might use that with a teen, but certainly not a young child for whom<br/>
that could be really frightening and besides, it&#39;s unecessary.<br/>
<br/>
I HAVE used the example of &quot;what if Dad and I treated each other the<br/>
way you&#39;re treating each other right now? How would it feel to be in a<br/>
house where that was ok?&quot; to help explain to them how hurtful it would<br/>
be if that behavior was the norm here.<br/>
<br/>
I have blocked hits,I have side-stepped hits or throws, I have removed<br/>
children from situations, I have offered up items that are ok to throw<br/>
or hit, I let them know without a doubt that it is not acceptable to<br/>
hit me. We leave a situation if the child is not able to be at their<br/>
best at that moment. I can&#39;t imagine going into a restaurant when a<br/>
child just hit someone. That is a sign that they are overwhelmed or<br/>
hungry or whatever....but NOT ready to be in public.<br/>
<br/>
There are so many options. One person could go in and get food and<br/>
bring it out where you could eat at a park where the child might be<br/>
able to be at their best in that moment. Maybe it was time to go home.<br/>
Maybe a LOT of things leading up to the hitting could have been<br/>
handled better. I don&#39;t know. But I know if my child is at the point<br/>
where lashing out is their tool, we don&#39;t need to be in public any<br/>
longer. Both for my  child&#39;s emotional safety and for the sake of<br/>
other people&#39;s peace and calm.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-275777612">I don&#39;t think the poser of these questions is on this list, but wanted <br/>
to address them anyway.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I have read on the unschooling<br/>
&gt;list where the parents write that they &quot;just don&#39;t allow&quot; kids to be<br/>
&gt;violent , swear at them or destroy things.They write that they<br/>
&gt;will &quot;do what it takes&quot; to stop destructive behavior, but nobody has<br/>
&gt;said exactly what it is that they will do. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Violence, swearing and destruction of things are different things, and <br/>
I think that lumping them together is the beginning of not dealing with <br/>
them in a thinking, reasoning manner.  I will stop violence in my home, <br/>
but I&#39;m not going to &quot;do what it takes&quot; to stop swearing.  We don&#39;t <br/>
happen to swear in our home (the kids would probably say that I have <br/>
the &quot;dirtiest&quot; mouth and that&#39;s for saying &#39;crap&#39;).  And if something <br/>
is theirs and they want to destoy it, well...that can be a lot of <br/>
fun!   <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Will you physically<br/>
&gt;restrain? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes.  I have a two yo.  Sometimes when he&#39;s frustrated and can&#39;t figure <br/>
out how to communicate he&#39;ll hit.  I will put my hand between him and <br/>
myself or whoever he&#39;s hitting at.  If he senses that I am trying to <br/>
honestly discern his problem that will probably be enough.  If he&#39;s <br/>
overwrought and tries to keep hitting then I would hold him so that he <br/>
couldn&#39;t inflict injury on anyone.  But there&#39;s a BIG difference <br/>
between holding a child with frustration in your heart and in your <br/>
voice and berating them for their behavior and holding them with love <br/>
and concern and really trying to figure out what&#39;s causing their <br/>
distress.  And even in that second scenario there&#39;s a difference <br/>
between loving them calmly and maturely or with whining and cajoling.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Will you hit that child? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No.  How illogical would that be?? &quot;I&#39;m going to hit you to get you to <br/>
stop hitting.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;What do you do when you stand in<br/>
&gt;between fighting siblings and they don&#39;t stop? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That depends on their age.  One thing I would do no matter WHAT their <br/>
age is try and figure out how their environment has been contributing <br/>
to their behavior.  Are they looking for power because something has <br/>
been making them feel powerless??  Has it been me?!?!?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;How is this so<br/>
&gt;different than being punitive? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How is what different?  Is there an assumption being made here?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Is it better to have a physical or<br/>
&gt;verbal fight with your child when they are now in a rage and so are<br/>
&gt;you? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Another assumption.  Start thinking about what you can do to not go <br/>
into a rage yourself.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;What about when they are bigger? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All the more reason to change the path.  But it sounds here that the <br/>
thinking is to change the children when most of the change needs to <br/>
happen with the adult.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;What if they win,do you then<br/>
&gt;have to call the police like you would if an adult started acting so<br/>
&gt;wild?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, some things depend on the age.  I hope it&#39;s never to late to <br/>
turn things around though.  Sad when things get to a point where one <br/>
thinks in terms of who wins.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well actually, you didn&#39;t HAVE TO do anything. Better to take away the<br/>
cap than stand there while he hit you I suppose,but there are lots of<br/>
even more useful options.<br/>
<br/>
If I just got hit, I might say &quot;you know, I really don&#39;t like helping<br/>
people who hit me,if you want to talk about this then DON&#39;T hit me and<br/>
I can listen better&quot; or something along those lines. It&#39;s hard for me<br/>
to write what I would say because it would SO greatly depend on the<br/>
child, the situation, my coping tools etc...<br/>
Less words is better for Jalen. So I might say &quot;If you want to talk,do<br/>
not hit me&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then I would really, truly listen to what they were upset about. &quot;You<br/>
really wanted the crisps?&quot; and let them explain their frustration.<br/>
Whether or not you can make the desire happen, that child needs to be<br/>
heard and understood more than anything.<br/>
<br/>
In the future, you could recognize what makes that person feel<br/>
helpless or frustrated and take measures to avoid it. We always take<br/>
snacks and drinks when we got out for instance. Giving the child their<br/>
own money to make choices with might be another way to empower them.<br/>
Being proactive is part of being a mindful parent. We are the beings<br/>
with greater experience and ability to utilize resources in society,<br/>
so we need to bring that to them and USE that awareness.Both of our<br/>
children and of available resources that will help them!<br/>
<br/>
A child that is hitting is usually out of tools or doesn&#39;t have very<br/>
useful ones to begin with yet. They need MORE help,more awareness, a<br/>
more proactive and mindful parent. Throwing our weight around isn&#39;t<br/>
helping them see better ways to function in this world.<br/>

<br/>
If you see yourself as your child&#39;s partner rather than his  <br/>
adversary, then you both can win.<br/>
<br/>
If the relationship is adversarial, doesn&#39;t there have to be a loser?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve thought a lot lately, and sadly, about how very many losers  <br/>
school *must* create.  No options.  It&#39;s where the winners come from,  <br/>
standing out in a sea of non-winners.<br/>
<br/>
I hadn&#39;t thought until I saw Mary&#39;s writing, though, that every  <br/>
adversarial parent/child dyad also has a loser.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
And in the examples given, I suspect the child had spoken and tried  <br/>
to get attention, and was being put off or ignored.  Even &quot;wait a  <br/>
minute&quot; can get old when it&#39;s not pretty quickly followed up by some  <br/>
VERY direct attention.  Don&#39;t say &quot;in a minute&quot; if you don&#39;t mean it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And if mothers want to throw some weight around, let it be toward  <br/>
other adults who will lure, encourage and expect you to ignore your  <br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had friends over who figured they were visiting and so would be  <br/>
the center of my attention.  But when I had kids, they had come to my  <br/>
work, to my place of business, and the kids came first.  If they  <br/>
wanted my undivided attention, they needed to buy me dinner on a  <br/>
night when Keith could keep the kids.  Nobody got to drop  in and  <br/>
tell me to ignore my kids while they were there.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen moms I knew and lots more I didn&#39;t get out in public with  <br/>
their mothers, and they become one of the kids, powerless to protect  <br/>

grandparents for lunch or a vacation, remember you are on duty-- <br/>
you&#39;re your child&#39;s partner, protector, defender, spokesman (if he  <br/>
needs one).   Make sure he&#39;s not being shunted off to the side.<br/>

This could be called &quot;Attentive Parenting&quot; - observe, learn all you  <br/>
can about your children, listen carefully to them, anticipate their  <br/>
wants and needs, strive to be their partner - their adult partner who  <br/>
knows a lot and has a lot of resources and is THERE for them. Help  <br/>
them be the best they can be. That&#39;s what THEY want and it is also  <br/>
what you want and it is what creates lots of joy in life.<br/>
<br/>
Think about how you feel when you are &quot;out of sorts.&quot; What will help  <br/>
you? What do you want from your family? I doubt it would help you for  <br/>
your husband to threaten, &quot;If you behave badly again I&#39;m going to take  <br/>
away your cell phone.&quot; You WANT to feel better, happier, nicer, right?  <br/>
What you need is support for doing what you, deep down, want for  <br/>
yourself. Same with your kids. Lots of times that means to help them  <br/>
have the chance to be alone to recenter themselves. I like to take a  <br/>
hot shower or go running or get deeply lost in a good book. Sometimes  <br/>
I can adjust my mood by reading email (or browsing around on Sandra or  <br/>
Joyce&#39;s websites). Your kids don&#39;t KNOW yet what helps them - your  <br/>
role is to help them figure it out. Threatening them with taking  <br/>
things away is not helpful - it ADDS to their stress and makes them  <br/>
feel unloved on top of everything else. How can that be a good idea?<br/>

==================================================<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t it a shame that people can feel satisfied in their parenting  <br/>
when they are NOT being mindful, connected or attentive? &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This culture, screwy as it is, encourages people to think that &quot;good  <br/>
parents&quot; are mean, humorless, punitive, cold-hearted, scary,  <br/>
demanding, commanding, controlling, derisive enemies of children.<br/>
<br/>
I saw one this morning at the grocery store.  She was telling her kid  <br/>
how to walk, what to do, how and when to get in the car...  No doubt  <br/>
she thinks she can command her child&#39;s thoughts and emotions.<br/>
<br/>
The adrenaline is upon me about something else that happened this  <br/>
morning, not parent/child/unschooling related.  I better go work in  <br/>
my yard or something!<br/>

I&#39;ve had friends over who figured they were visiting and so would be <br/>
the center of my attention. But when I had kids, they had come to my <br/>
work, to my place of business, and the kids came first. If they <br/>
wanted my undivided attention, they needed to buy me dinner on a <br/>
night when Keith could keep the kids. Nobody got to drop in and <br/>
tell me to ignore my kids while they were there.<br/>
 <br/>
*****<br/>
YES YES YES, this is what I never managed to get across to my own mother.  She would drop by or call me on the phone, then complain when the kids &#39;interrupted&#39; our visit and I &#39;rewarded bad behavior&#39; by helping them with whatever.   She never recognized that by visiting or calling she&#39;d interrupted me in my work.<br/>

The original plan was a sitter for the girls but the sitter had an emergency and I didnt have anyone else that could watch them. Courtney started out in a negative mood because she did not want to go. Then in the Dr&#39;s office I was trying to calm my screaming son, fill out paperwork and keep the girls entertained during the long wait. The appt ends and we get sent for bloodwork 4 blocks away. We go out and its about to rain so we get in the van. <br/>
   <br/>
  Nate is refusing to get in his carseat , the girls are fighting and Alyssa starts crying momma! At this point Im just so stressed and the niceness is gone! I get Nate strapped in, stop my feet and yell I need a time out!  <br/>
   <br/>
  They all started gigling which made me laugh. I opened the cooler and passed out drinks and snacks . The whole mood had changed and then I was able to be the mom I want to be. <br/>
   <br/>
  Alyssa needed a bathroom, Courtney was very hungry and wanted a meal and a snack seemed to take care for Nates needs. Everything got taken care of and all needs were met .<br/>

that path, and that is why your comments have been so helpful. i DO<br/>
feel a lot of pressure to conform to what i think others want to see<br/>
me doing ie.punish him,and that is something i need to change.  i DO<br/>

born (apart from an illness i had after his younger sister was born).<br/>

<br/>
Giving yourself two choices is way better than the &quot;I have no choice&quot;  <br/>
thinking most people have.   Here&#39;s how to use two choices to improve  <br/>
your choices for next time:<br/>
<br/>
Think of what you did last time that you wish you hadn&#39;t done, and  <br/>
then another option.  Until you&#39;ve thought of another option, wait.   <br/>
(It shouldn&#39;t take long.)  Then make the better choice.  Next time  <br/>
such a situation arises, think of two choices--maybe one will be  <br/>
better than you thought of the last time.  Then make the better  <br/>
choice if you can.  If you get flustered and make a bad choice, at  <br/>
least you chose.  And it will help you know what NOT to choose next  <br/>
time.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>&quot;Smashy smashy!&quot; can be great fun!  My son loved getting the last bit  <br/>
of fun from some broken toy by smashing it to bits with a hammer or a  <br/>
baseball bat.  I had two rules for that game: Eye protection had to be  <br/>
worn (swimming goggles would do) and the bits of plastic had to be  <br/>
picked up and thrown away, lest they injure one of the dogs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1600777530"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; It seems there is either permissive parenting where even if you state<br/>
&gt; your dislike of a behvior you have no way to enforce it. It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; comepletely up to weather the child wants to please you or not.Or the<br/>
&gt; opposition which is authoritarian parenting,not consensual,and you<br/>
&gt; are able to keep your authority.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In the Continuum Concept the author describes that the parents do<br/>
&gt; have a natural authority and will often command something,&quot;get that<br/>
&gt; bowl&quot; and the kids will happily comply because the want to be part of<br/>
&gt; things. If they say no, which the option is always there, there is no<br/>
&gt; coercion at all,the parent just accepts the child&#39;s choice.What do<br/>
&gt; they do differently that the children respect the parents natural<br/>
&gt; authority? Our AP kids will almost always say no.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It it really so wrong to desire parental authority?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is an either/or scenario that is so prevelant in parental thinking.<br/>
It&#39;s not either/or in terms of unschooling.  It&#39;s about being a partner<br/>
and acting as a team.  It shouldn&#39;t be about wether the kids or the<br/>
parents have the control or authority.  It&#39;s neither of those things. <br/>
It&#39;s more about doing what creates peace and happiness for all involved.<br/>
I don&#39;t people, kids included, like to feel at odds with the world and<br/>
unhappy.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know why people tend to gravitate towards chaos and dysfunction.<br/>
I see it all around me.  It isn&#39;t our existence at all.  When goal is to<br/>
get a bowl from the kitchen, what works best is the peaceful happy route<br/>
to getting that bowl.  Why insist someone get it for me if it causes<br/>
unrest in the house?  When kids see a parent creating peace and<br/>
happiness and that is what they grow up knowing, that is what they will<br/>
continue to create.<br/>
<br/>
If kids are hitting and behaving in uruly ways, there is clearly<br/>
something else going on within the dynamics of the relationship between<br/>
parent and child.  The parents are missing some behavioral clues from<br/>
their kids that they aren&#39;t getting to in time to prevent the behavior. <br/>
I really like to prevent fires rather than put them out.  When you&#39;ve<br/>
gone too far and have the fire, difuse it in the best peaceful happy way<br/>
possible.  You don&#39;t reason with a fire to get it to go out, you have to<br/>
physically alter it and you can do that without spanking it, which<br/>
metaphorically speaking might actually fan the flames higher, better to<br/>
get some water and disperse the embers.</div>
