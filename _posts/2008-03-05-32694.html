&gt;<br/>
&gt; :: Easing Exhaustion from Within ::<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Resistance is holding onto thoughts that block your<br/>
&gt; experience of Well-Being. Worry, frustration,<br/>
&gt; resentment, annoyance, etc. -- all are manifestations<br/>
&gt; of resistance.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Clinging to resistant thoughts takes a lot of energy<br/>
&gt; -- energy that *could* be easing your path.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ironically, parents often complain about (i.e.,<br/>
&gt; resist) not getting enough sleep. When you resist that<br/>
&gt; condition, the resistance drains your energy, causing<br/>
&gt; you to need even more sleep!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Of course it&#39;s good to get as much rest as you can<br/>
&gt; when you&#39;re exhausted. But you can also balance the<br/>
&gt; equation from the *inside* by releasing the resistance<br/>
&gt; that creates the stress that makes you tired --<br/>
&gt; including your resistance to tiredness itself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Today (and tonight) notice how you talk and think<br/>
&gt; about sleep and rest. Gently release any thought that<br/>
&gt; feels stressful. Imagine that every time you release a<br/>
&gt; resistant thought, it&#39;s like giving yourself an hour<br/>
&gt; of sleep. :-)<br/>
