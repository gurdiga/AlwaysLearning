<div id="ygrps-yiv-1709202200">I just joined this list so I thought I would say HI.  I know a <br/>
surprising number of people on this list so I already feel at home :)<br/>
<br/>
My name is katie and my kids are Aiden (18 months) and kathrynn (3 <br/>
years).  They are natural born learners :)  And they floor me at <br/>
every turn.<br/>
<br/>
My husband is Shawn and he&#39;s pretty uncomfortable about the whole <br/>
unschooling thing but he doesn&#39;t argue with me too much about it <br/>
since I&#39;ve proven to be right about so many other things LOL!<br/>
<br/>
Well I look forward to being on this list :)<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-489892332">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to introduce myself.<br/>
<br/>
I am a married wahm.  My boys are 2 and almost 6.<br/>
We unschool and love it.  I&#39;m very glad to have run across<br/>
this group who also loves John Holt and his work.<br/>
I don&#39;t have much support or know many families locally<br/>
who understand our way of doing things.  So, I&#39;m looking<br/>
forward to meeting some other folks who I can relate to<br/>
and  vice versa.<br/>
<br/>
I am also an artist and Spiritual Life Coach.  I work out of<br/>
my home so I can be with and play with and learn with my<br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>

<br/>
I just saw your post.  For a while I wasn&#39;t<br/>

<br/>
I am in Phoenix.  HOT, HOT!  Not to mention<br/>
those wildfires!<br/>
<br/>
Where are you?<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I like the name Meghan.  We&#39;re<br/>
planning on one more kid and if it&#39;s a girl,<br/>
her middle name will be Meghan.<br/>

Wow - thought I&#39;d never see the day.<br/>
Not many unschoolers that I&#39;ve connected with here so far.<br/>
I am in Phoenix too!<br/>

Tell me more about yourself.<br/>

I have 2 boys 9 & 11.<br/>
Been unschooling almost a year now - homeschooling 5 years before that.<br/>

Hi Karin,<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re very close!  12st and UH!  You must be near PV<br/>
mall!  I have a close friend right off 28th St and Cactus.<br/>
<br/>
I have two boys, 2 and almost 6.  A little younger than yours<br/>
but I know boys love to play together.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve belonged to other local groups online and off, but we<br/>
haven&#39;t clicked with anyone yet.  Not many unschoolers<br/>
anyway.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve unschooled even before they were born.  Anyway,<br/>
that&#39;s when I knew that&#39;s how we would raise our kids and<br/>
live our lives.  My DH wasn&#39;t all the way convinced and<br/>
still has his moments of doubt when my 6 year old goes<br/>
through spurts of interest in things and then off again.  But,<br/>
overall he&#39;s very intelligent and quick so my hubby is<br/>
trusting me.<br/>
<br/>
I work at home as well.  I am an artist and spiritual life<br/>
coach.  I paint portraits of people&#39;s souls.  It&#39;s actually very<br/>
fun and exciting.  I&#39;m branching out to do soulmate portraits<br/>
and beloved soul portraits (deceased loved ones).  The main<br/>
area I work with people on with coaching is manifesting.<br/>
I&#39;m having a ball learning about it and doing it.  When I joined<br/>
this group, I thought, &quot;It would just be nice to meet another<br/>
unschooler in Phoenix.&quot;  And there you were.  But I don&#39;t have<br/>
attachment to the outcome, so don&#39;t worry.<br/>
<br/>
Tell me more about yourself as well.<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1256668520">Hi Kelly Jo,<br/>
<br/>
You are very close!<br/>
PV mall is down the street a few miles from us - we&#39;re actually closer to<br/>
Cave Creek/Sweetwater, though.<br/>
<br/>
So you haven&#39;t really clicked with any local groups yet?<br/>
The group we go to is called Cave Creek Pioneers - that&#39;s in Cave Creek.<br/>
A very nice secular h/s group who are even open to unschooling, though none<br/>
of them unschool except for me.<br/>
The group is taking the summer off, though, and they start up again in<br/>
September.<br/>
Of course you&#39;re welcome to try it out when the meetings start up again -<br/>
they&#39;re nice people.<br/>
<br/>
Your artwork sounds cool and it&#39;s great that you can work at home.<br/>
I love to do all kinds of art - but don&#39;t sell artwork or anything like<br/>
that.<br/>
Other than that - I&#39;m usually with my boys all day.<br/>
They&#39;re very much into computer games, went through a Pokemon faze (that has<br/>
burned out, for now), like playing chess and all sorts of other things.<br/>
<br/>
If you ever want to meet up somewhere let me know.<br/>
Or feel free to e-mail me privately to chat some more.<br/>
It&#39;s great to meet you!<br/>
<br/>
Karin<br/>
<br/>
ps - hey! my phone prefix is also &quot;992&quot; (-6817)<br/>
