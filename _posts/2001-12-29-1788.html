<div id="ygrps-yiv-14110512">So...<br/>
<br/>
Looking for a quote to transcribe, and too lazy to go three rooms away where <br/>
Holt resides in the library, I pulled down two still-in-the-office faves, The <br/>
Zen Commandments, and Whole Child/Whole Parent.<br/>
<br/>
These aren&#39;t the quotes I&#39;m going to write, but here are a couple of good <br/>
ones.  For starters, from Dean Sluyter who wrote The Zen Commandments and Why <br/>
the Chicken Crossed the Road, just a couple of phrases.  One&#39;s the name of a <br/>
chapter:  No appointment, no disappointment.  Another:  No pretension, no <br/>
tension.<br/>
<br/>
Sluyter quotes Kafka:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You do not need to leave your room.  Remain sitting at your table and <br/>
listen.  Do not even listen, simply wait.  Do not even wait, be quite still <br/>
and solitary.  The world will freely offer itself to you to be unmasked, it <br/>
has no choice, it will roll in ecstasy at your feet.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s lots more, but Holly wants me to come and watch partof a video.<br/>
Gotta go.<br/>

<br/>
I found a John Holt quote on an Alfie Kohn website :-)  I&#39;d happened across<br/>
Alfie on the local educational cable channel; it was a tape of a seminar he<br/>
was doing on a show called &quot;Professional Development.&quot;  Do you know Google<br/>
will pull up over 3 million hit for that phrase?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, here&#39;s the quote from www.alfiekohn.org, in an article about<br/>
academic standards:<br/>
<br/>
Back in 1959, John Holt wrote that the main effect &quot;of the drive for<br/>
so-called higher standards in schools is that the children are too busy to<br/>
think.&quot; <br/>
<br/>

My personal fave homeschooling quote is from a friend of mine:<br/>
-- <br/>
If school works, we should all know enough algebra to be able to help our<br/>
children.  If it doesn&#39;t--why should I send my child?</div>
