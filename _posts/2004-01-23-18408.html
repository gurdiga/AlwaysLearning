<br/>
Category: Attachment Parenting<br/>
<br/>
 Discussion for homeschooling fans of John Holt, whose books Learning All the <br/>
Time, Never Too Late, and Teach your Own have made unschooling a sweet and <br/>
viable option for thousands of families. <br/>
<br/>
This is a moderated group, with trapdoors for the uncooperative. (Not <br/>
moderated in the advance-approval way, but in the be-nice-to-play way.) It&#39;s an idea <br/>
group and is intended to lean more toward pure unschooling than neutral, <br/>
general homeschooling discussion--there are hundreds of general homeschooling <br/>
discussions for newcomers. It&#39;s to focus more toward how people learn no matter <br/>
where in the world they are, rather than on what&#39;s legal in any particular <br/>
country or jurisdiction. <br/>
<br/>
If you have questions or complaints, write to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:SandraDodd@...">SandraDodd@...</a><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I figure some people just joined on a friend&#39;s advice and didn&#39;t see that <br/>
intro, perhaps.<br/>

If anyone is unhappy with this list and wants to start another one, just go <br/>
here:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/start">http://groups.yahoo.com/start</a><br/>
<br/>
It will walk you through the whole process, and you can come back here and <br/>
tell everyone about your new group and invite them to join.   But since I <br/>
started this one, I get to say when someone has gone on about something too long and <br/>
ask them to change the subject.  <br/>

-----------------------------<br/>
<br/>
It says you shouldn&#39;t be getting e-mail so my only guess is that yahoo hasn&#39;t <br/>
processed their updates somehow. I think our settings are requests for <br/>
yahoogroups to change the real settings, or something, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the problem, though.  It&#39;s beyond our aid, I think.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-805530097">Well, for once in my life, I am not deeply involved in the topic which <br/>
has been going on too long (or am I? hmm) or the one being chastized for <br/>
going off topic, violating list rules or whatever.  I&#39;ve been too busy <br/>
to read since monday and have 1400 unread (and likely to remain unread) <br/>
messages! <br/>

See, I can tell my relatives, I&#39;m not ALWAYS in trouble. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I checked at the website and it does say No Mail.<br/>
<br/>
That happened to me last July when I came back from vacation. I kept telling<br/>
Yahoo to change from digest to normal mail. It changed the setting but just<br/>
kept sending me digests.<br/>
<br/>
After about 3 days the actions matched up to the settings.<br/>
