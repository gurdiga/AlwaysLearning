<div id="ygrps-yiv-1423015269">yes, we are dating ourselves...<br/>
<br/>
I am 36..<br/>
<br/>
this mean, median, mode reminds me of<br/>
something Lexie (age 6) said the other day.<br/>
I said to her &quot;Lexie on a scale of one to<br/>
ten&quot; and she interupted me and said &quot;no, mom<br/>
not on a scale of one to ten, you have to<br/>
have it on a scale of 1-11, because if it is<br/>
1-10, there is no middle number, and so if<br/>
you feel just in the middle about something<br/>
you can&#39;t choose that.&quot;  I was looking at her<br/>
in amazement so she went on...  &quot;OK, mom, see<br/>
my fingers, I have four fingers up, see, two<br/>
on this side and two on that side, so there<br/>
is no middle number, because it&#39;s even, but<br/>
here, now I have FIVE fingers and see, now<br/>
there is a middle number, and that number is<br/>
three, so if you were on a scale of 1-5, you<br/>
could choose 3 if you felt in the middle.  So<br/>
we have to have a scale that is an on number<br/>
so we can have a middle number.&quot;  I told her<br/>
that middle number was called the median and<br/>
she tried it out a few times and said, OK, we<br/>
have to have a median number.  What is really<br/>
impressive (and I&#39;m very new to this<br/>
unschooling thing, ask Dar and Pam and<br/>
Marge--as an ex teacher I have a hard time<br/>
with it, I want to teach!) is that she has<br/>
discovered all on her own odd and even<br/>
numbers.  A few weeks ago she told me &quot;mom<br/>
did you  know that if you add two odd numbers<br/>
together you always get an even number but if<br/>
you add an odd and an even number together<br/>
you always get an odd number.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I am learning that I can not actively<br/>
teach her, using paper and pencil and books<br/>
and such and that she will still learn.  This<br/>
is a big step for me.  :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-590026448">welcome Joylyn!!<br/>
I am 37.<br/>
<br/>
Love the story about your dd with numbers.  My oldest is like that.  I<br/>
really love to admire her thought processes.  I didn&#39;t see her coming along<br/>
as I would&#39;ve liked with reading.  My attempts have only caused her to<br/>
resist and lose confidence.....I have let it go,  and hope the possible<br/>
&#39;damage&#39;  will work itself out.<br/>
I have found unschooling to be a much more challenging journey for ME than<br/>
the youngsters!  they know what their doing!<br/>

October....and saw him in Vegas at the MGM Grand&#39;s EFX show. He took over for <br/>

&lt;&lt; I liked Donny Osmond (I know, I know!) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I had no opinion about Donny Osmond one way or the other until I saw the <br/>
video of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat and it&#39;s wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
[There are three people on this list who saw me watch that one night, and Dan <br/>
asked me if I&#39;d like for them to leave so I could watch it alone, or <br/>
something to that effect...  It&#39;s not THAT bad, but it&#39;s good. &lt;g&gt;]<br/>

You know, I do think he&#39;s aged well and is an attractive man but when he and <br/>
Marie had their talk show, he acted so goofy that I kind of lost respect for <br/>
him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-715500997">But did you see the fear factor episode with Donny in it? I thought he was a great sport, especially when he had all those worms poured on him. I don&#39;t know if I could do that. Anyway, someone probably talked him into doing it because all the money won went to charity.<br/>

I like the new David Cassidy Mervyns commercial. He still has it going even after all these years.<br/>

find her really annoying!<br/>
