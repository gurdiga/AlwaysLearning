<div id="ygrps-yiv-1829810112">I am getting a feeling like I am just not doing enough.. Last&quot;school&quot; year we were busy busy busy with activities, hiking, soccer, swimming and some minor Latin per the boys request.. This year it just seems like they have no interest in anything outside of the home.. Could it be that they got what they needed out of those activities and need some down time?? I get to worrying that they have been on the games and T.V too much.. even though I know they are learning with Minecraft, Terraria, and the Xbox games they play, I am involved with them, learn with them about the games and stay connected.. but every time this time of year I get this feeling.. Like I am being watched by my peers and judged. I start to panic and want to drag out workbooks and what not.( I don&#39;t) but have this feeling like I need to..I start to get edgy with the kids about their games and what not.. I hate it..<br/>
<br/>
 It does not help that my mom is a school teacher in N.Y and likes to quiz me on everything they are doing at home.. <br/>
<br/>
 We have not yet connected to a lot of unschoolers here in our area( North of Seattle, Wa).. I have connected online via Yahoo groups and what not but nothing of interest has really come up for my 2 boys.. whom are 12yrs and 10.6yrs old. The group I am connected to has a lot of activities for kids 14 and up it seems.. then the other homeschool group I am part of has a lot of younger kids from 5-8.. so it is like we are stuck in the middle.. <br/>
<br/>
Just wanting to get that feeling off my chest... thanks for listening.. <br/>

Even though children might be deschooled in just a few months, it takes a parent a year or more of conscious effort to recover from all their schooling.  If you were in school 13 years and then college, or if you ever taught (even school at home), it will take that much longer.   Separate from what your kids are doing, spend some time and energy examining and overcoming the messages and thoughts and memories you have about school, learning, and &quot;have to.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
You can do that by being conscious about the decisions you&#39;re making, and why you&#39;re making them.  You can do that while your kids are playing Minecraft. :-)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
No, it doesn&#39;t help, but she&#39;s in New York and you&#39;re near Seattle.  Send her links to unschooling articles, maybe.  There are quite a few here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://unschooling.blogspot.com">http://unschooling.blogspot.com</a><br/>
<br/>
How long have you been unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
-=-Just wanting to get that feeling off my chest... thanks for listening.. -=-<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t get it off of you by just expressing it, though.  Your thoughts and actions will need to change so that it doesn&#39;t come back every year, so that you don&#39;t continue to have feelings you hate.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/deschooling">http://sandradodd.com/deschooling</a><br/>
Even if you&#39;ve read it and every single link, read some of it again.<br/>
Read a little, try a little, wait a while, watch.<br/>
<br/>
There is a conference fairly near you in May.  Start saving money to go to it.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://lifeisgoodconference.com/presenters/">http://lifeisgoodconference.com/presenters/</a> <br/>
 (Keith and Holly said I should send a different photo.  Holly says I look like I&#39;m going to cry.  Keith says my eyes are closed.  But they were open, and I was happy, and I liked the rainbowy sunbeams on the strap of my overalls.  I guess I&#39;ll send a different photo, though.)<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes people say they can&#39;t afford conferences, and I know sometimes they can be expensive, but if you can see it as a necessary cost of unschooling, and budget for it, it can make a big difference.  If parents were required to take a course after which they would be allowed to homeschool, parents would take those courses and pay money for them.  If parents were required to take a test before they were allowed to homeschool, there would be cram schools and coaches and test preparation books and parents would pay for those.  School-at-home parents pay money to go to conventions just to get to go into the vendors&#39; halls to spend hundreds of dollars on whichever curriculum they eventually are persuaded they can&#39;t live without.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling doesn&#39;t have an $800 curriculum to sell you, so you might consider that attending a conference takes the place of that.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It doesn&#39;t help to think in terms of the school year. The calendar year is almost at an end - make a New Year&#39;s resolution to drop all thought of academic years and grade levels. Focus on this moment right here and now. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Could it be that they got what they needed out of those activities and need some down time??&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We have moved over the past 2 years from a very full week of scheduled activities (swimming, music group, play group, horse-riding) to no paid activities at all. We still have various unschooling meet-ups and playdates 3 times a week, but have gradually shed all our structured programs. If the kids were interested I would have no problem starting up one or more structured activities again, but for now this more relaxed approach is suiting us very well.<br/>
<br/>
More deschooling, more confidence, will allow you to see the wonderful learning that can unfold naturally when kids are given the scope and support to pursue their interests outside of a formal setting.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;but every time this time of year I get this feeling.. Like I am being watched by my peers and judged. I start to panic and want to drag out workbooks and what not.( I don&#39;t) but have this feeling like I need to..I start to get edgy with the kids about their games and what not.. I hate it..&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s possible your peers are looking at your homeschooling methods and making comparisons and judgements about what you do (I think most people do that to some degree). It&#39;s also possible that the judgement is coming from schoolish thoughts in your own head. The fact that you want to drag out workbooks says to me that you still don&#39;t trust that kids can learn exciting and important things outside of a structured setting. And see how the edginess starts to create a wedge in your relationship with your kids?<br/>
<br/>
Still, it is good to reflect on how you are going as an unschooling parent. Maybe there is more you could be doing. Maybe if there aren&#39;t many unschoolers in your area you could help your kids to find friends through other means - did they make friends with anyone at soccer or swimming that you could see outside school hours? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It does not help that my mom is a school teacher in N.Y and likes to quiz me on everything they are doing at home..&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One approach might be to frame your answers to her questions in academic terms. Give her examples of your children&#39;s learning that fit in a more formal paradigm. Highlight the literacy and numeracy aspects of their gaming. Don&#39;t trivialise their computer time as &#39;just playing&#39;; say instead that they are working to achieve their goals.<br/>
<br/>
With time and a concerted effort to deschool yourself, you&#39;ll come to understand and value natural learning more and more, and your fear of others&#39; judgement will fade. When parents and kids are really on the same team it becomes pretty obvious.<br/>

<br/>
Start your own activity! I&#39;m going to start a gaming day here, after Christmas, twice a month. Our house is small, and we have pets so people with allergies can&#39;t come, and often our space is messy. We don&#39;t have much of a kitchen, and just a teeny-tiny kitchen table, no dining table. All of those things (and more) kept me from doing that before now - but my kids&#39; needs to connect with others close to us trump all of that. We have several working TVs, several game systems, we can order pizza. I can borrow one of those big folding tables so if someone wants to play a board game, we have a space to do that - even if that space is rather squeezed in!<br/>
<br/>
What are your kids into? There&#39;s a family here that has Pokemon club once a month, and someone else has Lego days at their house. Start a once-a-month gathering. &quot;If you build it, they will come.&quot; Commit to having it regularly, even if very few people show up initially. <br/>
<br/>
There are LOTS of unschoolers in your area - I bet there are some just waiting for someone to post something, like you have been waiting!<br/>
<br/>
You also might consider going to an unschooling gathering or event even if your kids aren&#39;t completely excited about going - getting out and meeting others starts with getting out and meeting others! You can let your kids know if they&#39;re really not liking being there, you&#39;ll leave, but why not try?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
It won&#39;t work everywhere, and probably not in winter, but when we met in parks, when my kids were little, any kid who didn&#39;t want to come out and play would sit in the car and read or play gameboy or something, while the mom hung out with other moms nearby.  And more often than not other kids would go and lure the recalcitrant kid out of the car. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Another benefit of gatherings like that is some kids might be invited to stay longer, or some families might invite one or more of the host family kids to go home with them from time to time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1100885877">We have been unschooling for 5yrs+ years.. :) But feel like I have always been an unschooler. Except for a 2 yr period when my older son was in developmental preschool for 2 yrs from the time he was 3 to 5yrs old. He is on the Autism Spectrum diagnosed at 3yrs old. It was great play and therapy for him but once he hit Kindergarten it went to hell, so we pulled him out 2mo. after and never looked back. It was the best thing ever. He has blossomed so much over the years and also had some major medical trials ie: seizures and Celiac diagnosed within 2 mo. of each other. <br/>
My younger son has never been in any sort of school environment.. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1857707893">I saw the word &quot;unworthy&quot; and it made me think of this great book I recently read called The Gifts of Imperfection: Let Go of Who You Think You&#39;re Supposed to Be and Embrace Who You Are by Brene Brown.  It&#39;s about shame, worthiness, and whole-hearted living.  I don&#39;t usually read these kinds of books but it came highly recommended and I found it really useful.  It&#39;s not specifically about unschooling, but I don&#39;t think it goes against any of the principles either.  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>HA! Hahahahahahaha!<br/>
<br/>
This is a phrase that bubbles up out of the mind of those still desperately<br/>
needing deschooling. How do I know? I&#39;m one of the viciously overeducated<br/>
too. And that takes a lot of healing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; we were busy busy busy with activities, hiking, soccer, swimming and some<br/>
&gt; minor Latin per the boys request..<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Busy does not equal virtuous, nor appropriate. It&#39;s just something you can<br/>
use to flog other people with when they question you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This year it just seems like they have no interest in anything outside of<br/>
&gt; the home..<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So they&#39;re turning in. No biggie.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Could it be that they got what they needed out of those activities and<br/>
&gt; need some down time??<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Totally.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I get to worrying that they have been on the games and T.V too much.. even<br/>
&gt; though I know they are learning with Minecraft, Terraria, and the Xbox<br/>
&gt; games they play, I am involved with them, learn with them about the games<br/>
&gt; and stay connected..<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How are they interacting with each other? with you? Are they growing,<br/>
physically? How&#39;s the harmony level?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but every time this time of year I get this feeling.. Like I am being<br/>
&gt; watched by my peers and judged. I start to panic and want to drag out<br/>
&gt; workbooks and what not.( I don&#39;t) but have this feeling like I need to..I<br/>
&gt; start to get edgy with the kids about their games and what not.. I hate it..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s just that you need to deschool. It&#39;s all in your head. Which, for me,<br/>
is reassuring. My own attitude is the only thing I can control. So...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;  It does not help that my mom is a school teacher in N.Y and likes to quiz<br/>
&gt; me on everything they are doing at home..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>AH! So you *are* being judged! That makes it worse.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;  We have not yet connected to a lot of unschoolers here in our area( North<br/>
&gt; of Seattle, Wa).. I have connected online via Yahoo groups and what not but<br/>
&gt; nothing of interest has really come up for my 2 boys.. whom are 12yrs and<br/>
&gt; 10.6yrs old. The group I am connected to has a lot of activities for kids<br/>
&gt; 14 and up it seems.. then the other homeschool group I am part of has a lot<br/>
&gt; of younger kids from 5-8.. so it is like we are stuck in the middle..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My kids go through phases of wanting to be with other kids, and just<br/>
wanting to be on their own. It&#39;s healthy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Just wanting to get that feeling off my chest... thanks for listening..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>OK, so here&#39;s the jump I use...<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a paradigm shift.<br/>
<br/>
I value relationships above pretty much everything else. Are my kids<br/>
learning to nurture? Yes. Are my kids learning how to support each other?<br/>
Yes. Are my kids learning how to have a mutually supportive,<br/>
non-competitive, non-combative family life? Yes. So in the face of that,<br/>
memorizing a bunch of trivia is really... trivial.<br/>
<br/>
The world we live in is changing, and a lot of people in an older<br/>
generation have sort of missed that boat. There&#39;s a really funny cartoon<br/>
going around on Facebook about schooled kids wanting unschoolers on their<br/>
side when the zombie apocalypse comes, because the unschoolers are the ones<br/>
with the survival skills.<br/>
<br/>
The trick to silencing the monkey on my (school-trained) brainstem is to<br/>
keep this in mind. The lessons they&#39;re spending their childhood learning<br/>
are what matters and anyone who doesn&#39;t get that, isn&#39;t someone whose<br/>
judgment matters to me all that much.<br/>
<br/>
My kids look out for each other. They teach each other stuff. They<br/>
encourage each other. (OK, let&#39;s be totally honest, they also sometimes try<br/>
to beat the tar out of each other. But it passes, no one gets hurt, and<br/>
when it&#39;s over, they both tell me not to interfere, because they enjoy it.<br/>
Kinda reminds me of films of lion cubs...). You simply cannot place that<br/>
kind of learning on a standardized test, so the mainstream does not value<br/>
it. I will not make that mistake.<br/>

<br/>
It took me MANY years to not know or care whether &quot;the school year&quot; (other people&#39;s, not &quot;ours&quot;) was in session/over/starting.   Finally I knew I had done it when a friend who taught history asked me and Holly to come and do something for her classes, and I offered mid-June.   CURED!!!!  HOW could I have forgotten school is out in late May here, always!?  Very... v.e.r.y..... slowly. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Good questions, nicely phrased:<br/>

A couple of years ago, we were out buying some stuff for some project or<br/>

The reason I threw &quot;physically&quot; growing in there is that, sort of like the<br/>
spoons analogy (<br/>

kids only have so much energy. My kids, right before a growth spurt, want<br/>
nothing more than to stay home, eat constantly, and watch videos. They are<br/>
conserving energy, and I take that as my signal to go find bigger clothes<br/>
and shoes for them. Physical growth is more than just height and weight,<br/>
it&#39;s also immune function and neurology and emotional chemistry and all<br/>
kinds of deeply foundational stuff. They&#39;re *not* &quot;just&quot; eating and<br/>
playing; on a metabolic level, they&#39;re hugely busy.<br/>
<br/>
Then, once they&#39;ve grown, they want to go out and see museums and run in<br/>
the sunshine and go to the pool every day, and not eat so much.<br/>
<br/>
Then, it changes back again. It&#39;s part of why I cringe so hard when people<br/>
do the &quot;All my kid is doing is playing video games and eating&quot; as if it was<br/>
a bad thing. Are they looking at what&#39;s happening in the physical child?<br/>
Not so much. In the fierce and relentless pursuit of constant academic<br/>
achievement, physical and emotional health get completely forgotten. And<br/>
that&#39;s damaging, ultimately.<br/>

I&#39;m fairly energetic, for an old lady. :-)<br/>
It&#39;s not athleticism, but I do get a lot done in my life.  Yet there are some days when I play a video game for hours, while listening to a recording of someone else reading a book, or I sew something non-crucial-to-the-world while watching a movie I&#39;ve already seen a dozen times.  I&#39;m zoned out, kind of, but kind of not.

Then I come back and &quot;do nothing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I want to color.  <br/>
Some people knit or crochet or quilt or carve wood or string beads.<br/>
Sometimes I want to use markers to color in designs.  I might throw them away, but while I&#39;m doing it, it&#39;s soothing.<br/>
<br/>
For the ALL Unschooling Symposium in a couple of week, I&#39;ve been collecting coloring books and pages, mazes, dot-to-dots (I had some left over from a conference session I did, and will put those in the box), and markers.  I&#39;m going to buy new crayons.  These are not just for young children.  They&#39;re for anyone who would like to color or doodle while listening to a speaker, while listening to others&#39; conversations.
