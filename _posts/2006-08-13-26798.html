<div id="ygrps-yiv-1917420226">Oh, not playing with Barbie or owning one, but Diana Jenner sent me a  <br/>
Barbie link, and the stuff was amusing my GREATLY, but for two  <br/>
things.  It&#39;s too rough for my Barbie page (which is http:// <br/>
sandradodd.com/barbie ) and some of the Barbie quotes were hot  <br/>
links.  I followed one.  eeep....   current real discussions.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m reading this one, feeling sad for all concerned, and saw  <br/>
without even reading the responses that people were generally just  <br/>
agreeing with her and &quot;supporting&quot; her.  Maybe one of them gave her  <br/>
the kind of advice about being gentle and understand that she would  <br/>
get from this list or on other kinda-related lists.  Pretty much they  <br/>
took her side, in what seems to me an &quot;us vs. them&quot; way.<br/>
<br/>
How do I deal with my defiant 2yo dd? She closes her eyes and ignores  <br/>
me when I try to reprimand her!<br/>

The scenario this evening was that 6yo dd and 2yo dd were in the  <br/>
bath. 2yo wanted something from 6yo - and smacked her when she  <br/>
couldn&#39;t get it. Of course, this is not allowed.<br/>
<br/>
Our usually response is to ask the offending child to apologise to  <br/>
the &quot;victim&quot; and to take the child out of the situation.<br/>
<br/>
Well, when I asked 2yo to apologise and hug her sister, she just shut  <br/>
her eyes and completely ignored me! Even when I took her out of the  <br/>
bath and started to dress her, she kept her body still and her eyes  <br/>
shut the whole time!!<br/>
<br/>
I ended up putting her into bed - and there wasn&#39;t even a glimse. I  <br/>
have to admit I was impressed that a child so small can be so stubborn.<br/>
<br/>
So, I have to rethink how we parent this child - what worked for the  <br/>
older is not going to work fir her.<br/>
<br/>
Any advise?<br/>

Well, I wouldn&#39;t demand an apology at this age. I&#39;d just remove her.  <br/>

She doesn&#39;t often hit, but I can see the defiance growing.. - Hannah  <br/>
