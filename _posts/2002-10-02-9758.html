<div id="ygrps-yiv-590307118">I am wondering why there are a couple of <br/>
handwriting samples there.  Anyone know?<br/>
<br/>
There was a discussion on handwriting analysis at one point I believe. And <br/>
someone suggested posting them and Voila! There they were.<br/>

It was about how we interpret people through writing, and that with e-mail <br/>
some of the clues are missing, like handwriting.<br/>
