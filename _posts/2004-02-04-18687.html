<br/>
&quot;Ren is our &quot;spiritual leader&quot; and a perfect example of someone who <br/>
struggled <br/>
to get here (her whole, strange trip is available in the archives of <br/>
unschooling.com boards) &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I dun&#39;t know about spiritual leader...snark, snark. But my whole, strange and embarassingly public transformation is indeed available today. I&#39;ve even saved my own posts and can post them for anyone that doesn&#39;t believe Kelly. lol<br/>
The sad thing is, I really, really loved John Holt and his views back when I first started researching homeschooling...back in 1995. I just couldn&#39;t GET IT why my ds didn&#39;t act interested in the cool stuff those kids in the book did. So I pushed.<br/>
And pushed, and then a little less, and less and pretty soon we were very eclectic/relaxed and already considered fringe by all the other homeschoolers around us.<br/>
THEN, I went totally unschooling...as far as education goes. But it took me a bit longer to get how it relates to ALL our lives, including tv and food and chores and....well, y&#39;all know.:)<br/>
I&#39;m the poster child for transformation in public.<br/>
Because I&#39;m loudly opinionated, but I am willing to change. So it&#39;s all out there for you folks to read.<br/>
