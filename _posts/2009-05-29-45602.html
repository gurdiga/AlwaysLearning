There isn&#39;t a huge amount there but you can add your own if you live  <br/>
near something made famous :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-613214730">Cool site.<br/>
<br/>
I had a problem navigating it though. The &quot;all spots&quot; page, lists about 8<br/>
spots and then I couldn&#39;t get it to access anymore. Clicking on the yellow<br/>
tabs on the country didn&#39;t work either. Were you able to navigate that page?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
How could they not select my spot? The hotel where they filmed The Shining!</div>
