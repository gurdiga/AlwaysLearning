<div id="ygrps-yiv-50206024">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Holly has lots of Kelly dolls (half a dozen or<br/>
more) and two Stacies and one Skipper (the younger<br/>
sisters and such).  Ken has a little brother, <br/>
Tommy, who&#39;s like Kelly.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Tamzin has loads of Kellys and Tommys. It&#39;s funny, in<br/>
the UK they&#39;re called Shelly (maybe a copyright<br/>
thing?). She also loves the baby, Chrissy, and has a<br/>
few of them too.<br/>

<br/>
Is Kelly too Irish to be fun/neutral there?<br/>
<br/>
Also it could be the need for re-manufacturing them all so there&#39;s more money <br/>
in the U.K. and not to the U.S. owners.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve asked this before, but am still interested if anyone knows who would <br/>
know or where the answer might be found:  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were <br/>
re-done for England.  Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles, no nun-chuks (replaced <br/>
with two swords for that character, I think), and stories re-written.   <br/>
Partly it was probably for English sensibilities and not to promote illegal <br/>
weapons, but I&#39;m guessing more that it was economics.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1688839531">Nun-chuks are illegal in UK, but not two swords?<br/>
Nun-chuks were originally used as a weapon (instead of<br/>
only as a threshing tool) becease swords had been made<br/>
illegal...........<br/>

<br/>
I doubt it. There is a huge Irish population in the<br/>
UK, particularly London. There&#39;s actually not much<br/>
Irish/English antagonism in England itself. It&#39;s very<br/>
much located in Northern Ireland.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Partly it was probably for English sensibilities<br/>
and not to promote illegal weapons&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I doubt it! They have just as many violent toys with<br/>
suspect weaponry as the local American Toys R&#39; Us!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I&#39;m guessing more that it was economics.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty convinced it&#39;s an economic thing. There are<br/>
so many American items/companies over there with<br/>
different names. For example: TK Maxx instead of TJ<br/>
Maxx (that&#39;s GOT to be for economic reasons).<br/>
