It is a checklist for new unschoolers, and it gives some pretty good <br/>
advice.  I&#39;m not a *new* unschooler, but I found some helpful reminders <br/>
in this list, especially #7-10.<br/>

She credits me!  That&#39;s sweet.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t fully agree with her #7 and #8.  The explanations help make  <br/>
it good, but the list items themselves could cause problems for some  <br/>
people.  I had &quot;yes, but...&quot; thoughts as I read those.<br/>
<br/>
7.  Allow yourself to be imperfect.<br/>
<br/>
8.  Remember that what other people think of you is none of your  <br/>
business.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think they work well for people who worry even though they&#39;re being<br/>
conscientious and dealing respectfully with others.<br/>
<br/>
#7 and #8 work well for dealing with the unconventional appearance of your<br/>
life, specifically how the child/parent relationship looks to other people<br/>
in the community or extended family who think enforced bedtimes, no or low<br/>
TV/ video/ computer, spanking, timeouts, &quot;good jobs,&quot; and other conventional<br/>
child training methods are signs of good parenting.<br/>
<br/>
For people who are already fine with how it looks, it could be a matter of<br/>
sometimes being insensitive to others.<br/>
