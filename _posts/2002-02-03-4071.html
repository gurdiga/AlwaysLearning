&lt;&lt; How do you play Speed? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s version, learned from other kids, either exactly &quot;traditional&quot; or <br/>
not, <br/>
between the two players, set two cards face down.  On the outside of the set <br/>
of two, five cards, face down, on each side.  Deal out the rest of the cards, <br/>
face down.  <br/>
<br/>
Each player takes five off the top of her own pile.  You draw to refresh your <br/>
hand to five from your own pile when you need to.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, the two turn up the single face-down cards.  If you have <br/>
anything that will play on either of them, by same number or in sequence in <br/>
suite, put it down.  You can play again immediately, but you have to return <br/>
to your hand.  (If you have three fours, you can&#39;t put them all down at <br/>
once.)  You replenish your hand when you get a chance, and if you can play <br/>
what you draw, do it.  When neither can play, both turn over the top of the <br/>
piles of five (or whatever&#39;s left) from the sides.<br/>
<br/>
When one player goes out it&#39;s done.<br/>
<br/>
If both still have cards and the side-piles in the center are gone, shuffle <br/>
all those, split them in two (estimate&#39;s good enough) and set them outside <br/>
where the playing field will be (the two face-up) and at the same time you <br/>
each turn one up.<br/>
<br/>
You can &quot;wrap around,&quot; ace to king, back to ace, queen, ace, two.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a race, with elements of chance.<br/>
