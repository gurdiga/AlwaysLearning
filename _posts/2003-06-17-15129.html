<div id="ygrps-yiv-933565064">Joylyn,<br/>
<br/>
My 4yo (5 in September) is begging me for purple hair.  How&#39;d you do <br/>
Janene&#39;s?  Did you have it done at a place or did you do it at home <br/>
yourself?  Or was it a temporary one?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve promised her purple hair for her birthday party.  But I have yet to <br/>
find a local salon that does &#39;weird&#39; colors.  She&#39;s half Asian and has DARK <br/>
brown hair so I imagine there will be some initial lightening involved.  I <br/>
colored my own hair a few times as a teen but am by no means experienced at <br/>
it.  So I don&#39;t know that I would trust myself to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Is hair dye even safe to use on a 4yo?  Are there specific concerns I should <br/>
have?  I found a temporary one night one but it doesn&#39;t come in purple.  <br/>
Pink yes, blue yes, red yes, but not purple.  If I use the red it might be <br/>
purple enough but I know she wants true Jewel toned amethist purple!<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions, or ideas from ANYONE are more than welcome!!<br/>
<br/>
Kathrynn and I thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Katie<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*****&quot;Lexie has learned to open a wine bottle.  It just kinda happened, but <br/>
I<br/>
think it&#39;s quite an achievement even if I can&#39;t put it on her Learning<br/>
Record.<br/>
<br/>
And Janene has learned how to perform a toast, better than some adults.<br/>
Today Lexie brought me a glass of wine while I was bathing with Janene.<br/>
She brought Janene a glass of water.  I made a toast to Janene, per<br/>
Janene&#39;s request.  &quot;To my most beautiful purple haired soon to be five<br/>
year old daughter, I&#39;m so lucky you are mine!&quot;  Janene makes her toast<br/>
&quot;To my wonderful and sweet mommy, whom I love dearly, I&#39;m lucky you are<br/>
my mommy!&quot;<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-643426726">Hi Katrina, I really didn&#39;t mess with Janene&#39;s hair at all, I just added <br/>
purple extensions to her hair, braided them in.  Her hair is the same as <br/>
it aways was.  <br/>
<br/>
I know extensions can be used with different hair type, not just African <br/>
American hair, but I would find someone who can braid very well if you <br/>
don&#39;t know how.  And the child has to sit still.  Janene&#39;s hair took <br/>
about 7 hours, five hours one night and 2 the next.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Come to the Live and Learn conference and Sandra or I will show you how <br/>

<br/>
Anyone who wants to do that needs to bring some yarn and scissors, though, &#39;k?<br/>
I don&#39;t do teensy, though.  Just into full-sized braids or French braids.  I <br/>
don&#39;t have the patience or small fingers to do cornrows.  I have a very short <br/>
attention span.  But the principle is the same.<br/>
<br/>
I had tried to figure out how to do it on my own in mid-teens, because of <br/>
some illustrations I had seen of medieval hairdos, but couldn&#39;t figure it out.  I <br/>
just let the idea percolate in there, and kept looking at photos of medieval <br/>
this&#39;n&#39;that and finally one day figured it out.   Then someone saw me doing it <br/>
and said &quot;Hey, that&#39;s how they do hair extensions!  Only with hair. &lt;g&gt;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I reinvented the friggin&#39; wheel, but I had never known to take those <br/>
medieval images to hairdressers and say &quot;So... how&#39;d they get this gold cord into <br/>
that hair?&quot;<br/>

his hair blue (team colour) if they one the Provincials two years ago.)  In<br/>

&lt;&lt; i&#39;ve got to figure out a way to keep a partially-done braid in place so i <br/>
can rest my arms in the middle of braiding; just can&#39;t keep them up long <br/>
enough to do my own hair.  :-( &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 I can&#39;t French braid my own hair.  With others, you can ask them to hold it <br/>
while you go get drink, snack, watch a movie....&lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
No, I don&#39;t like her explanations.  Nice page for braids in general, but as <br/>
to braiding things in, I think her ideas are bad.<br/>
<br/>
I did figure out first how to do the two side-by-side pieces of hair, which <br/>
is cool for thick, long hair, but it&#39;s so medieval it might be too weird for <br/>
modern use.    She describes it this way: &quot;A variant of ribbon braiding produces <br/>
the Parallel Braid.  If you keep the hair in two tight columns, and braid the <br/>
ribbon around them (in a figure 8 pattern), you get a very interesting braid. <br/>
It is my belief that this was used in some of the Italian hair dressing <br/>
styles.  Here is an illustration of how the braid in process will look; I won&#39;t <br/>
diagram the process, as it is fairly easy once you have the basic 3-strand braid <br/>
technique. The important point is to keep the ribbon flat and loose. &quot; and <br/>
shows it with one ribbon.  Nah.  If you do it with two, and weave back and forth, <br/>
you have some ribbon to tie it off!  <br/>
<br/>
And she shows starting something by tying it around the hair. That&#39;s how I <br/>
used to do it in high school, I&#39;d fasten the ribbon into a hair tie, then cover <br/>
up the hairtie, then braid it in.  But that&#39;s lame and wrong.  They didn&#39;t <br/>
have hair ties and they didn&#39;t NEED hairties.<br/>
<br/>
No on the PDF instructions too.  BORING.   <br/>
<br/>
No, friends, we can show you how to braid so much purple yarn into a braid <br/>
WITHOUT HAIRTIES at either end, that the braid can be thicker at the end than <br/>
where you started.  And for straight hair, an added benefit is when you take the <br/>
yarn out you have wavy, wavy hair.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe look up hair extensions, or look for Ballet Folklorico costume sites, <br/>
maybe.  Sometimes they braid wide red ribbons into the dancers&#39; hair, pass it <br/>
over the front as Germans did with braids a lot) and tie the ribbons across on <br/>
the other side in big matching bows, so girls with short hair and long hair <br/>
can seem to have matching hair.<br/>
<br/>
 I looked and found references, but no photos of that hairstyle and no <br/>
illustrations.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, though, to play with it, get yarn and cut pieces four times as <br/>
long as you think the braid is likely to be.  (I make mine longer than four <br/>
times, but four times will do for starters.)<br/>
<br/>
Cut lots of them.  Depending how fat the yarn is, but to practice, do twelve <br/>
for each braid (if one braid, twelve or twenty).   <br/>
<br/>
You can have a lovely assistant, but I usually drape mine over places where <br/>
they won&#39;t get all tangled up with each other, so first I adorn my room with <br/>
yarn hanging on every doorknob, on the towel bar, on the handlebars of the <br/>
rowing machine, on clothes hooks...<br/>
<br/>
Get the braid started.  Make sure the top hair is smooth because you don&#39;t <br/>
want to start this stuff over.   By &quot;started&quot; I mean make your three strands, <br/>
cross two, and hold it.  Put the middle of one of the pieces of yarn behind what <br/>
you&#39;re holding there.  Pull one piece of yarn into the outside strand (about <br/>
to go in) and put it in, hair and yarn.  The other half of yarn is in your <br/>
hand now, and comes into the middle with the other side piece.  <br/>
<br/>
Stop.  Add another piece of yarn.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t count.  I just keep putting them in and if one strand seems lacking <br/>
yarn, I make sure to put the next one where it will go there. If one&#39;s getting <br/>
too full, skip that one next time.  <br/>
<br/>
Put a hair tie on as usual, trim the yarn, you&#39;re done.<br/>
<br/>
Advanced plan:  <br/>
Use so much yarn that as you run out of hair, there&#39;s as much &quot;hair&quot; (yarn <br/>
hair) as ever.<br/>
When you run out of hair, keep going with just yarn.  when you&#39;re done, tie <br/>
an overhand knot and trim the end into a tail (don&#39;t cut it too short).  OR if <br/>
you know how to make tassels, wrap the end tassle-style (you won&#39;t be able to <br/>
fold it over, but I mean the end-wrap knot that goes on a tassle.<br/>
<br/>
You can have those braids long, or wrap them around your head and tie the <br/>
yarn to itself, or around by your ear when you get to a good stopping place <br/>
(depends how long it all is whether it just goes over the top, or first under and <br/>
then over, or time and a half...)<br/>
<br/>
With that kind of braid, when you&#39;re ready to take it out, cut it off where <br/>
the hair ends and throw all that yarn away.  Even with the most expensive yarn, <br/>
it&#39;s cheaper than the beauty parlor.<br/>

&gt; My 4yo (5 in September) is begging me for purple hair.  How&#39;d you do<br/>
&gt; Janene&#39;s?  Did you have it done at a place or did you do it at home<br/>
&gt; yourself?  Or was it a temporary one?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve promised her purple hair for her birthday party.  But I have yet to<br/>
&gt; find a local salon that does &#39;weird&#39; colors.  She&#39;s half Asian and has <br/>
&gt; DARK<br/>
&gt; brown hair so I imagine there will be some initial lightening <br/>
&gt; involved.  I<br/>
&gt; colored my own hair a few times as a teen but am by no means <br/>
&gt; experienced at<br/>
&gt; it.  So I don&#39;t know that I would trust myself to do it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Is hair dye even safe to use on a 4yo?  Are there specific concerns I <br/>
&gt; should<br/>
&gt; have?  I found a temporary one night one but it doesn&#39;t come in purple. <br/>
&gt; Pink yes, blue yes, red yes, but not purple.  If I use the red it <br/>
&gt; might be<br/>
&gt; purple enough but I know she wants true Jewel toned amethist purple!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any suggestions, or ideas from ANYONE are more than welcome!!<br/>

&gt; I<br/>
&gt; think it&#39;s quite an achievement even if I can&#39;t put it on her Learning<br/>
&gt; Record.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And Janene has learned how to perform a toast, better than some adults.<br/>
&gt; Today Lexie brought me a glass of wine while I was bathing with Janene.<br/>
&gt; She brought Janene a glass of water.  I made a toast to Janene, per<br/>
&gt; Janene&#39;s request.  &quot;To my most beautiful purple haired soon to be five<br/>
&gt; year old daughter, I&#39;m so lucky you are mine!&quot;  Janene makes her toast<br/>
&gt; &quot;To my wonderful and sweet mommy, whom I love dearly, I&#39;m lucky you are<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-690646375">Hi Katrina - Dagny likes to dye the tips of her hair blue.  She does just<br/>
the tips so when it wears off or she gets sick of it she can just get a<br/>
haircut.  Plus she just likes the way it looks.  She has light brown hair,<br/>
and she does need to bleach it to get the color to work.  We get the color<br/>
online.  I can dig up the site if you&#39;d like.  I&#39;d say the hardest part is<br/>
that she has to sit relatively still while waiting for the bleach to do its<br/>
thing.  That wouldn&#39;t be as much of a problem if you do the whole head,<br/>
though.  Other than that, it&#39;s a very simple process.  Good luck! ~Rue</div>
