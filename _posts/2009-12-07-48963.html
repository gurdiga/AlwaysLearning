<div id="ygrps-yiv-1838124967">Hello, I joined this forum because I have been considering and researching homeschooling and unschooling for several months.  I love the philosophy of unschooling.  It meshes with my beliefs.  <br/>
<br/>
I think I am having some trouble making the leap because my children have always attended school.  <br/>
<br/>
I have two boys, ages 6 and 9.  They are in the first and third grade and attend public school that is one mile from my house.  I work very part-time (once a week while they are in school) and spend maximum  time with them (outside of school).  They are &quot;straight A&quot; students. They seem to do fine but I have fears that public school will squash their love of learning. (I&#39;m not sure they have a strong love a learning at this point.   Hopefully it can be rekindled.)  I think they are &quot;burned out&quot; after school and play outside and play video games and computer games.  They are learning at these times, I&#39;m probably not viewing it as such.<br/>
<br/>
I might be posting in the wrong forum to ask such a question but is it your belief that traditional school &quot;ruins&quot; kids?  <br/>
<br/>
My eldest son races through homework with the goal of getting it over with.  There is no learning, joy, or inquisition.  It does not bother me that he hurries since I think the homework is excessive and he wants to spend after school time relaxing, playing outside, or doing other activities he enjoys.  I&#39;m certain that he is not retaining half of the work he is doing at home.  I&#39;m not sure how much he is absorbing in school.  He is very bright and one of the &quot;smartest&quot; in his class.  I think he likes school for the most part.  I have been gently discussing homeschooling and he asks me all kinds of questions, &quot;How will I learn?&quot; &quot;How will I learn my multiplication tables?&quot; &quot;When will I see my friends?&quot; etc.  He says he wants to remain in school and I am fine with that.  <br/>
<br/>
My youngest also does well in school.  He is very keen on the prospect of unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
Is it possible to unschool during the weekends, after school, and summers?  I realize this question might be crazy. I do trust in my children and respect them as individuals.  I feel that I am a facilitator in their learning at home.  This hasn&#39;t always been the case.  I am an ever evolving parent and made, and still make, plenty of mistakes.  Examples: In the past I have signed them up for activities they didn&#39;t want to participate in, directed their lives in many ways, yelled a lot, forced them to practice piano,  probably sent them to preschool too young, spent too much time on the internet instead of with them, etc.  Ugh. I&#39;m glad I have seen the light and continue to learn about myself and work to become a better parent. <br/>
<br/>
What should I be thinking about now?  What books are the best to read for a parent that is considering unschooling?  I realize this is long and all over the place.  Thanks so much for any comments or advice.</div>

Taking a child out of school against is will is the same deal as  <br/>
making one go to school against his will.  I wouldn&#39;t do it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1725495360">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Is it possible to unschool during the weekends, after school, and <br/>
summers?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
This is something that I feel very strongly about.<br/>
<br/>
There is a lot of confusion out there, in the homeschooling community and <br/>
elsewhere, that unschooling is defined as &quot;anything and everything&quot;. The <br/>
confusion comes, I believe, from a misunderstanding about the difference <br/>
between the definition of unschooling and the daily practice of unschooling <br/>
in our lives (which can be the anything and everything of people&#39;s <br/>
passions).<br/>
<br/>
The *definition* of unschooling is very narrow and rigid. Sandra, Joyce, Pam <br/>
and others have worked long and hard and vigorously to keep spreading the <br/>
message that unschooling is a full time, lifestyle commitment to Not Doing <br/>
School - in action and in thought (that&#39;s the hard part).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like a small doorway that you squeeze through to find the whole wide <br/>
wonderful world on the other side, all looking different after your <br/>
experience of squeezing through that door.<br/>
<br/>
There are a whole set of practices that are emphatically not unschooling. <br/>
Living with school in your life forces you to engage in those practices <br/>
everyday.<br/>
<br/>
I applaud you for wanting to be a mindful parent, which goes hand in hand <br/>
with unschooling - BUT can also exist without unschooling! Mindful parenting <br/>
can exist every day.<br/>
<br/>
So can learning. If you want your kids to want to come home and unschool, <br/>
you have to make life more fun, more lively, more interesting than school is <br/>
every day.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt; I might be posting in the wrong forum to ask such a question but is it <br/>
your belief that traditional school &quot;ruins&quot; kids?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Undoubtedly school ruins some kids. Some kids love school. Others cope or <br/>
survive.<br/>
<br/>
However we can never know how things might have been different for any <br/>
particular child. I can&#39;t know whether my dd might have survived schooling <br/>
perfectly well, with whatever coping mechanisms she would devise for <br/>
herself.<br/>
<br/>
What I do know is that unschooling is a wonderful life that we have chosen <br/>
and ingrained into our thinking to the extent that the idea of sending my dd <br/>
to school is so awful - to all three of us. So we are sacrificing my income <br/>
(such as it might be) to enable it. You could say that unschooling has <br/>
ruined my dd for school, at least for now.<br/>
<br/>
Initially we wanted to homeschool because of the fears you mention. My dh <br/>
and I distrusted the schools available to us, the system, and in a way we <br/>
distrusted that our dd could survive in our crappy school system. (Something <br/>
I have changed my thinking on since seeing and appreciating her wonderful <br/>
strength and willfulness.)<br/>
<br/>
We now consider unschooling to be a better life than even the best possible <br/>
school experience, for us. The best thing about unschooling is that our time <br/>
is our own.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Undoubtedly their play is several things at once. A release of  <br/>
energy. A release of stress. An opportunity to do what they enjoy  <br/>
that they&#39;ve been kept from all day. There&#39;s also some avoidance of  <br/>
what they&#39;re forced to do all day.<br/>
<br/>
Learning happens as a side effect of living even for schooled kids.  <br/>
But the above reasons can get in the way of learning. Unschooling  <br/>
kids don&#39;t have those getting in the way. (Well, unschooling kids can  <br/>
build up energy and get stressed too! But not the constrained and  <br/>
imposed kind that schooled kids need to suffer through every day.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My eldest son races through homework with the goal of getting it  <br/>
&gt; over with. There is no learning, joy, or inquisition.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s a rare child who will find learning or joy or something  <br/>
intriguing in homework. It&#39;s rote work intended to imprint  <br/>
information into kids&#39; brains so they can spit it back for tests.  <br/>
Educators *hope* more profound learning happens as a result of class  <br/>
instruction, reading and homework, but the goal is to prepare kids to  <br/>
take tests. Educators don&#39;t want that, but it&#39;s how the system is set  <br/>
up. (Though most educators are convinced that what they do is  <br/>
necessary for learning.)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He is very bright and one of the &quot;smartest&quot; in his class.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Smart at what though? Performing for tests?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not trying to be snarky (and you did put &quot;smartest&quot; in quotes)  <br/>
but it&#39;s truly unfortunate that kids are subjected to a learning  <br/>
system that doesn&#39;t match the way humans naturally learn -- and in  <br/>
many ways is counter to it -- and the ones who can do it are  <br/>
considered smart and the others not so smart. All the grades really  <br/>
mean is that someone can perform the way schools need them to. It  <br/>
really has nothing to do with smart. I got good grades in school  <br/>
without much effort. What it really indicated is I can absorb  <br/>
information without trying.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;How will I learn?&quot; &quot;How will I learn my multiplication tables?&quot;  <br/>
&gt; &quot;When will I see my friends?&quot; etc. He says he wants to remain in  <br/>
&gt; school and I am fine with that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Though I would tell him he can learn just fine by exploring what  <br/>
interests him, it&#39;s quite likely he won&#39;t believe you. ;-) Natural  <br/>
learning is different than school learning. Living doesn&#39;t provide  <br/>
the same kind of feedback that school does. You don&#39;t see the  <br/>
progress through a textbook or stack of papers.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t sugar coat this to convince him. Be honest. He would have  <br/>
less time with his schooled friends but he could see them after  <br/>
school. He&#39;d also likely meet some homeschooling kids.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; is it your belief that traditional school &quot;ruins&quot; kids?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It has an effect on all kids. Some manage to cope and survive. Some  <br/>
are damaged severely. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible to escape school  <br/>
without picking up some screwy ideas about what learning is and how  <br/>
to treat people. For instance in real life, cooperation and working  <br/>
together toward a common goal is a good thing. But in school, it&#39;s  <br/>
severely punished and called cheating. The society in school doesn&#39;t  <br/>
match anything in real life except maybe prison.<br/>
<br/>
But forcing a child to homeschool when they&#39;re enjoying school would  <br/>
be worse. Let him come to the decision in his own time. Lots of kids  <br/>
enjoy elementary school. When they hit middle school, things often  <br/>
change.<br/>
<br/>
If the younger one wants to come home, bring him home and let the  <br/>
older one continue with what he enjoys. Let him accompany you  <br/>
occasionally when you&#39;re doing something fun.<br/>
<br/>

I was thinking about suggesting the another Grace Llewelyn book, the &quot;How to quit school and get a real life and education&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I love her books, but she incorporates a lot of &quot;education&quot; into her ideas of natural learning.  The way she proposes unschooling to function and look like, looks NOTHING like what happens in our house, not one iota similar.  I like her for similar reasons that I like John Holt, how she digs into how the school system that we know doesn&#39;t really do what it says it does and why and how it could be different.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s good for people entrenched in the school system.  <br/>

<br/>
I have a pet peeve about people using the word &quot;education&quot; when they mean &quot;schooling&quot;, as if the two words are synonymous, so I&#39;ve used the word &quot;education&quot; myself to mean something that includes both schooling and unschooling. I used to tell my always schooled daughter, &quot;School is only a part of your education and not necessarily the most important part&quot;, meaning there are many things to learn that she won&#39;t be taught at school; but, now I&#39;m thinking about it, I couldn&#39;t say to my son that what he&#39;s doing is only a part of his education. What he&#39;s doing is everything of what he&#39;s doing. Which is going about his daily activities and learning as he goes. I&#39;m certainly not giving him an education. Maybe he&#39;s &quot;getting an education&quot; by osmosis. And I only describe my son as &quot;self-educated&quot; for the benefit of others, it&#39;s not a description he&#39;s ever used. It&#39;s how I describe myself. But I study, albeit informally. Hmm ... I shall have to have a ponder on that one.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-677572251">Thanks so much for all of the comments.  I will definitely check out the Guerrilla parenting book.  I have read the reviews on Amazon and ordered it.   Sandra, thanks so much for the links to the articles -- they are very helpful.  I found your site through your Leading Edge Parenting interview.  I have read many articles on your blog since then.  I am still researching and thinking.  I used to have this belief that I am not stimulating or interesting enough.  My husband and I tend to be quiet and we are immersed in our own interests (mainly reading).  I don&#39;t want to sound like we don&#39;t interact and have fun with our kids but we do tend to let them do their own thing while we do ours.  Whenever I discuss the idea of leaving school my husband does not openly object.  This is a good sign.  <br/>
<br/>
I have always been slightly disenchanted with our school. I have never expressed this to my children.  I always exhibit a positive attitude about school around my kids because this is what my mother did.  I don&#39;t want them to think it&#39;s a miserable place.  My younger son is a good public school student -- he toes the line, but when I ask him about it he says he dislikes it.  I think he objects to sitting all day and doing worksheet after worksheet.  He is bored. <br/>
<br/>
My nephew, who is five-years-old and has autism, attends the same school as my children.  He is in pre-K and was suspended last week for three days for hitting another child.   What is the goal of suspending a five-year-old with autism?  What is it supposed to teach?  It&#39;s very upsetting. I feel uncomfortable sending and keeping my kids in this system.  I wish my sister would remove him.  She is a single mom that works full-time and she thinks she doesn&#39;t have a choice.  I want to &quot;homeschool&quot; him since I work very little.  Maybe it will come to that.  Thanks very much to all.</div>

LOL. I was just reading yet another &quot;What Is Unschooling?&quot; article and  <br/>
it opened with &quot;Unschooling is a movement in education.&quot; -=-<br/>
<br/>
In that context it makes sense.  If you&#39;re standing a long way from  <br/>
unschooling and you say &quot;education,&quot; then unschooling is part of the  <br/>
greater field of &quot;education.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re standing inside the unschooling neighborhood, then education  <br/>
seems far the other direction, and involves a pre-set body of  <br/>
knowledge that &quot;educated&quot; people are expected to have.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Self educated&quot; means learned all those things in one&#39;s own way,  <br/>
without the &quot;benefit&quot; of a fancy school.  Self-educated people are  <br/>
like Abraham Lincoln who might rather have been privileged enough to  <br/>
have been in boarding school, but had to slum it elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s just one way of looking at it.  That&#39;s just the way that  <br/>
supports my particular stance. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not adamantly opposed to the use of &quot;education,&quot; except when it&#39;s  <br/>
getting between someone and seeing that natural learning might not be  <br/>
the &quot;education&quot; they were looking for, nor might it result in the same  <br/>
&quot;education.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I used to think so, more, many years ago.   I&#39;m drifting away from  <br/>
thinking it.   I think the word &quot;education&quot; conjures up school subject  <br/>
matter for most people, and would not include things learned from  <br/>
driving race cars or playing world of warcraft.  Maybe flying planes  <br/>
and playing chess would count as &quot;education.&quot;   Education has an edge  <br/>
where it drops off into &quot;non-educational,&quot; I think.  Natural learning  <br/>
doesn&#39;t.<br/>

Look into the laws where you are.  You might not be able to homeschool  <br/>
someone else&#39;s child, even a relative, but your sister might  <br/>
homeschool him and you&#39;d be the daytime babysitter.  And if you get to  <br/>
the point that unschooling is what you both want and understand and  <br/>
do, then he&#39;ll be learning as much at your house at hers, but you  <br/>
won&#39;t need to feel responsible for all his learning.<br/>
<br/>
If you bring your own children home, be wary of sticking them with a  <br/>
cousin so much of the time.  That could be a problem.   It could limit  <br/>
what you could do with your own kids.  But it&#39;s definitely doable!<br/>
<br/>
I think my advice would be to keep looking into unschooling, maybe  <br/>
gradually give your kids more options and leeway and experiences, and  <br/>
see how it all goes, so that if something dramatic happens with school  <br/>
and one of the kids wants to bail, you&#39;ll be ready.<br/>
<br/>
Some families take their kids out of school at the first whiff of  <br/>
homeschooling being legal, and then they&#39;re unprepared, which doesn&#39;t  <br/>
instill confidence in the kids.<br/>

This is exactly why what Grace Llewelyn writes about unschooling in the Teenage Liberation Handbook, it looks nothing like what my own teenager is doing.  She describes ways in which one could get an &quot;education&quot; without school, ways to fill in the gaps of knowledge.  In reality, while there may be some kids that do that, my kids would really be over that edge and in that gap learning about the world in a very different sort of way.<br/>

&gt; LOL. I was just reading yet another &quot;What Is Unschooling?&quot; article and  <br/>
&gt; it opened with &quot;Unschooling is a movement in education.&quot; -=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In that context it makes sense.  If you&#39;re standing a long way from  <br/>
&gt; unschooling and you say &quot;education,&quot; then unschooling is part of the  <br/>
&gt; greater field of &quot;education.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you&#39;re standing inside the unschooling neighborhood, then education  <br/>
&gt; seems far the other direction, and involves a pre-set body of  <br/>
&gt; knowledge that &quot;educated&quot; people are expected to have.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Self educated&quot; means learned all those things in one&#39;s own way,  <br/>
&gt; without the &quot;benefit&quot; of a fancy school.  Self-educated people are  <br/>
&gt; like Abraham Lincoln who might rather have been privileged enough to  <br/>
&gt; have been in boarding school, but had to slum it elsewhere.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That&#39;s just one way of looking at it.  That&#39;s just the way that  <br/>
&gt; supports my particular stance. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not adamantly opposed to the use of &quot;education,&quot; except when it&#39;s  <br/>
&gt; getting between someone and seeing that natural learning might not be  <br/>
&gt; the &quot;education&quot; they were looking for, nor might it result in the same  <br/>
&gt; &quot;education.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I used to think so, more, many years ago.   I&#39;m drifting away from  <br/>
&gt; thinking it.   I think the word &quot;education&quot; conjures up school subject  <br/>
&gt; matter for most people, and would not include things learned from  <br/>
&gt; driving race cars or playing world of warcraft.  Maybe flying planes  <br/>
&gt; and playing chess would count as &quot;education.&quot;   Education has an edge  <br/>
&gt; where it drops off into &quot;non-educational,&quot; I think.  Natural learning  <br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-442276428">&lt;&lt; I applaud you for wanting to be a mindful parent, which goes hand in hand<br/>
with unschooling - BUT can also exist without unschooling! Mindful parenting<br/>
can exist every day.&gt;&gt; <br/>
 <br/>
Yes it can and does! I&#39;ve had conversations with my MIL about how she made<br/>
life fun and interesting for her 2 boys after school, on weekends, and<br/>
during breaks. (I wouldn&#39;t call her overall approach in parenting &quot;mindful&quot;<br/>
but she was like an activities director on a cruise!) She took them to<br/>
Yankee games, skiing in Vermont, dinner in NYC, and made sure they went to<br/>
museums, national parks, saw plays and ballets, and were involved in boy<br/>
scouts. She said it&#39;s up to every parent to create that life for their<br/>
child. Schools can only do so much. Parents are supposed to fill in on their<br/>
time. I argued that if every parent was doing all of that, the kids wouldn&#39;t<br/>
need school! <br/>
 <br/>
Unfortunately she still sees school as necessary, as a place to send your<br/>
kids during the day so mom can have a break or do her thing. Granted, she<br/>
was a single mom from the time her kids were 5 and 9. Upon getting divorced<br/>
she had to get a job. That made her work even harder to give her kids those<br/>
special experiences. I think she was trying to make up for not being able to<br/>
be home with them anymore. In a different marriage and with the right<br/>
exposure, she could have been a good candidate for unschooling!<br/>
 <br/>
However, she is who she is and her other grandkids are in &quot;excellent&quot; public<br/>
schools, so she is very skeptical about our version of homeschooling. I<br/>
think she has backed off since Kindergarten is not a big deal, but she has<br/>
put the pressure on my husband about where Damon is going to 1st grade.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1532883121"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I think my advice would be to keep looking into unschooling, maybe  <br/>
&gt; gradually give your kids more options and leeway and experiences, and  <br/>
&gt; see how it all goes, so that if something dramatic happens with school  <br/>
&gt; and one of the kids wants to bail, you&#39;ll be ready.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Some families take their kids out of school at the first whiff of  <br/>
&gt; homeschooling being legal, and then they&#39;re unprepared, which doesn&#39;t  <br/>
&gt; instill confidence in the kids.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Very good advice, Sandra.  Thank you.  I am still learning so much and moving away from unconsciously parenting them they way I was parented.  There are many occasions in their life that I did not allow them enough freedom.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-67343689">Kim, thanks for your comment.  I am one of those moms that likes to expose my kids to many different things.  Sometimes I think my ego and fear was the motivation for doing some things.  Examples:  I signed my eldest child up for a hoity-toity art class when he was four because my friends&#39; kids were doing it.  The same with some special classes that were offered at the museum during the summer.  He didn&#39;t even enjoy it and wanted to stay home but I made him go.  I feel horribly guilty about that.  I kind of pressured my kids to play baseball because my parents love the game.  I insisted that they play and practice piano.  Yeah, I have issues.  I&#39;m learning and working to repair the disrespect I have shown them. My eldest son loves baseball so hopefully I didn&#39;t screw things up too badly.  <br/>
