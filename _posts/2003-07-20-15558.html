<div id="ygrps-yiv-673606201">in august I will be traveling for about 2 1/;2 weeks and would love to <br/>
meet some of you.<br/>
<br/>
I will be going to the HSC conference, then over to camp at Donner pass <br/>
for a day or two, then down to Vegas for a night or two, then over <br/>
across Arizona, spending the night in Winslow I think, then to New <br/>
Mexico, Alb. and the Jemez Mountains.  Sandra, I&#39;d love to spend a bit <br/>
of time with you, maybe going to the mall to piss my dad off (cause <br/>
don&#39;t you know the homeschool kids in Alb. just spend all their time at <br/>
the mall!)  ;-)  Anyone else on that road?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-316126514">But Lexie doesn&#39;t LIKE Peter Pan, and NEVER did. just ask her.  Of <br/>
course, we crack up laughing, which makes her even more mad.  For those <br/>
not in the know, when LExie was about two we had to call her Peter, she <br/>
loved Peter Pan so much.  She wouldn&#39;t answer to Lexie, only to Peter. <br/>
 My dad, the counselor, was concerned and thought we shouldn&#39;t play <br/>
along.  I shrugged it off saying if she still wanted to change her name <br/>
to Peter and was pretending to fly at 22, we&#39;d worry.  Of course, it <br/>
passed and she became Lexie again (although now she wants to be Rose). <br/>
 And now she claims she NEVER EVER even thought of liking Peter Pan the <br/>
movie.  Of course, Janene is TOTALLY into Peter Pan.  When is the show? <br/>
 Tell me more.  Could you come camping with us?  We have a large enough <br/>
tent, we&#39;d just need you to bring sleeping bags.<br/>

&quot;Youth is not a time of life; it is a state of mind; it is<br/>
not a matter of rosy cheeks, red lips and supple knees; it<br/>
is a matter of the will, quality of the imagination, a<br/>
vigor of the emotions; it is the freshness of the deep<br/>
springs of life. &quot;<br/>

she then couldn&#39;t be cast in a lead role because she&#39;d miss too many<br/>
rehearsals. I was sort of irked, but we&#39;ll see, casting isn&#39;t until next<br/>

September (the date is not quite firm yet, but either the 3rd or 4th<br/>
weekend), and that&#39;s always much fun. I&#39;m going to try to get tie dye<br/>
stuff again - which reminds me, Joylyn, the Dharma Trading Co. store in<br/>
in San Rafael, kinda sorta not too far out of your way... I&#39;m assuming<br/>

the parts she&#39;ll take, she&#39;d be in rehearsal then, but if she doesn&#39;t<br/>
(and she&#39;s only willing to take a couple of roles) she&#39;ll be auditioning<br/>
for a show the last week in August at a different theater, so we&#39;d be<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hello Joylyn and Dar and everyone else!!!<br/>
<br/>
I have always loved Peter Pan. I always wanted to go to Neverland, but hated <br/>
the thought of leaving my mommy and daddy behind. My absolute favorite is <br/>
&quot;Hook&quot; when Robin Williams played Peter. I both laugh and cry everytime we watch <br/>
it. Then this week a friend gave me a Dar Williams CD to listen to, <br/>
specifically because of the gender song &quot;When I was a Boy&quot;. My friend put the CD in while <br/>
we were driving and said, &quot;Really listen to this one...&quot; and sure enough when <br/>
the song eneded I was balling, the twins were in deep contemplation over the <br/>
lyrics and my girlfriend both smiled and apologized simultaneously and said, <br/>
&quot;I knew you would react this way.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Here are the lyrics:<br/>
<br/>
When I was a Boy by Dar Williams<br/>
<br/>
I won&#39;t forget when Peter Pan came to house, took my hand<br/>
I said I was a boy, I&#39;m glad he didn&#39;t check<br/>
I learned to fly, I learned to fight<br/>
I lived a whole life in one night<br/>
We saved each other&#39;s lives out on a Pirate&#39;s deck<br/>
<br/>
And I remeber that night<br/>
When I&#39;m leaving a late night with some friends<br/>
And I hear somebody tell me it&#39;s not safe, someone should help me<br/>
I need to find a nice man to walk me home<br/>
<br/>
When I was a boy, I scared the pants off my mom<br/>
Climbed what I could climb upon<br/>
And I don&#39;t know how I survived, <br/>
I guess I knew the tricks that all boys knew<br/>
And you can walk me home but I was a boy, too<br/>
<br/>
I was a kid you would like, just a small boy on her bike<br/>
Riding topless, yeah, I never cared who saw<br/>
My neighbor came outside to say, &quot;Get your shirt,&quot;<br/>
I said &quot;No way, it&#39;s the last time I&#39;m not breaking any law&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And now I&#39;m in a clothing store, and the sign says less is more<br/>
More that&#39;s tight means more to see, more for them, not more for me<br/>
That can&#39;t help climb a tree in ten seconds flat<br/>
<br/>
When I was a boy, see that picture? That was me<br/>
Grass-stained shirt and dusty knees<br/>
And I know things have gotta change,<br/>
They got pills to sell, they&#39;ve got implants to put it, they&#39;ve got implants <br/>
to remove<br/>
But I am not forgetting <br/>
That I was Boy too<br/>
<br/>
And like the woods where I would creep, it&#39;s a secret I can keep<br/>
Except when I&#39;m tired, except when I&#39;m being caught off guard<br/>
I&#39;ve had a lonesome awful day, the conversation finds its way<br/>
To catching fire-flies out in the backyard<br/>
<br/>
And I tell that man I&#39;m with about the other life I lived <br/>
And I say now, &quot;You&#39;re top gun, I have lost and you have won&quot;<br/>
And he say&#39;s, &quot;Oh no, no can&#39;t you see?<br/>
When I was a girl, my mom and I always talked<br/>
And I picked flowers everywhere that I walked<br/>
And I could always cry, now even when I&#39;m alone I seldom do<br/>
And I have lost some kindness<br/>
But I was a girl too<br/>
And you were just like me , and I was just like you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I am sure just reading the lyrics is not anywhere near is gripping as hearing <br/>
it sung, but beautiful none the less. <br/>
<br/>
See you and yours in Neverland,<br/>
Rhonda - who is gonna search out her copy of Hook <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think I like that one best, too. I don&#39;t really like the musical<br/>
version because it doesn&#39;t attemt to explain why Wendy and her brothers<br/>
would be so eager to fly off to Neverland - in the book, Wendy is to be<br/>
moved out of the nursery the next day, and this is her last night as a<br/>
child, and she flies off so she doesn&#39;t have to grow up. *That* makes<br/>
sense.<br/>
<br/>
Rain would love to be Peter ::sigh:::<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Then this week a friend gave me a Dar Williams CD to listen to, <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I *love* that song. The first time I heard Dar Williams was 6 or 7 years<br/>
ago, when she opened for Joan Baez, and she sung that one, and I went<br/>
right out and bought the cassette. Rain loved &quot;The Babysitter&#39;s Here&quot; -<br/>
she was 4ish - and she still does the spinach line from that one whenever<br/>
we have spinach. And yes, most people IRL actually call me Daron, and I<br/>
didn&#39;t shorten it to Dar I heard her song (although hers is short for<br/>
Darlene, I believe, and in the world of musical theater I&#39;m the one they<br/>
assign to the dancing or acting stuff, not the singing!).<br/>
<br/>
We like The Pothead Song, too... it has a longer name, something with<br/>
poignant and pointless and co-ed in the title, but everyone calls it The<br/>
Pothead Song.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Dar<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Isn&#39;t she just awesome? We are currently in love with the holiday song, which <br/>
right now the song title escapes me, but it&#39;s the one where the Pagan niece <br/>
calls the Christian Uncle and has dinner at his home during Winter <br/>
Solstice/Christmas.<br/>
<br/>
Kass and Kree find so many questions prompted by her songs, by most music <br/>
overall. It can be breath-taking and heartbreaking all rolled into those <br/>
conversations, but I think I am most grateful that they truly listen to all the music <br/>
we enjoy and want to understand the perplexities of society because of some <br/>
great lyrics. Just Friday, while at another homeschooler&#39;s birthday party, we <br/>
(adults) discussed music and it&#39;s effects on our society. We, DH & I, do not <br/>
censor the music the girls listen to, but rather try to learn what it is the <br/>
singer/songwriters are trying to say with them. I knew I would get a few eyeballs <br/>
popping out when I said that during the party. Not everyone understands why we <br/>
don&#39;t censor their music as most parents I know do censor their kids music. <br/>
Of course I have difficulty from the unschooler&#39;s perspective, especially when <br/>
music is not &quot;allowed&quot; for some kids due to the lyrics, but I accept that not <br/>
everyone is willing to subject themselves to hear things they are convinced as <br/>
just negativity to sell records. It just isn&#39;t that way for us, we see that <br/>
most songs are a story and generally have something to be gained, even those <br/>
drenched in profanity. Kass & Kree don&#39;t understand such censorship yet, maybe <br/>
they never will, since they haven&#39;t been subjected to that and may never be.<br/>
<br/>
Rhonda - who by the way Dar, after I posted those lyrics and hit send I <br/>
thought, wow, what if SHE is the same Dar??? Then I thought, Oh crap if she is I <br/>
sure hope I got those lyrics right. LOL <br/>

&gt; weekend), and that&#39;s always much fun. I&#39;m going to try to get tie dye<br/>
&gt; stuff again - which reminds me, Joylyn, the Dharma Trading Co. store in<br/>
&gt; in San Rafael, kinda sorta not too far out of your way... I&#39;m assuming<br/>
&gt; that if you&#39;re driving up for the conference you won&#39;t be up again for<br/>
&gt; crawdads. :(<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Could you come camping with us?  We have a large<br/>
&gt; &gt; enough<br/>
&gt; &gt; tent, we&#39;d just need you to bring sleeping bags.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Possibly - Rain&#39;s auditioning for another show this week and if she gets<br/>
&gt; the parts she&#39;ll take, she&#39;d be in rehearsal then, but if she doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; (and she&#39;s only willing to take a couple of roles) she&#39;ll be auditioning<br/>
&gt; for a show the last week in August at a different theater, so we&#39;d be<br/>
&gt; free until then. It sounds like fun, we&#39;ve been wanting to go camping<br/>
&gt; this summer but it hasn&#39;t happened yet - I&#39;ll let you know!<br/>

Hi, Dar --<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll plan to get tickets for Peter Pan the second weekend.  Maybe I can<br/>
see you then.  If you aren&#39;t going to attend every single show, then let<br/>
me know which ones you&#39;ll be at.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard of the legendary crawdad festivities because I used to<br/>
subscribe to Heather Madrone&#39;s Home-Ed list.  I was a lurker there and<br/>
didn&#39;t really feel like part of the group.  But I pressed my nose<br/>
against the window some.  <br/>

I haven&#39;t called for availability but we will be pulling in on the <br/>
afternoon of the 22nd of August, leaving mid morning the 23rd, our plan <br/>
is to set up camp (tent camping) and then visit the ruins at dusk, and <br/>
again in the am, trying to leave by 11am to go to Alb.  How does this sound?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1115910349">the more I look at this site the moreI want to go.  I hope they have <br/>
nice tent camp sites.  We&#39;d love to have company Peggy, or anyone, if <br/>
you&#39;d like to join us.<br/>

<br/>
ps, as I&#39;m planning this trip my dad is helping.  I can tell he&#39;s <br/>
working really hard, successfully, to not say a word about me camping <br/>
alone in a tent with two children.  My mom did say that some of the <br/>
driving would be hard with one driver, but that was all.  I&#39;m proud of <br/>
my parents, they are coming a long way.  <br/>

&lt;&lt; Sandra, I&#39;d love to spend a bit <br/>
of time with you, maybe going to the mall to piss my dad off (cause <br/>
don&#39;t you know the homeschool kids in Alb. just spend all their time at <br/>
the mall!)  ;-)  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Okay, but it needs to be after I get back from South Carolina, which is <br/>
Tuesday a week and a half after the HSC conference.  So don&#39;t drive too fast!!<br/>
<br/>
How long will you be with your parents and hereabout?<br/>
