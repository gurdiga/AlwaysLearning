&gt; I don&#39;t repeat gossip, so listen carefully the first time.<br/>
&gt; My idea of cleaning the house is sweeping the floor with a glance. I cleaned <br/>

&gt; Your secrets are safe with me and all my friends - none of us can remember. <br/>
&gt; You know you&#39;re getting old when you stop to think and forget to start <br/>
&gt; again.<br/>
