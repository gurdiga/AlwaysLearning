&gt; having one and at that moment it&#39;s like you and your child are speaking<br/>
&gt; different languages.  <br/>
&gt; Whatever brings on a tantrum has brought real confusion to a child. It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; not being able to process what you are asking or not being able to<br/>
&gt; articulate what they are feeling.  It&#39;s not willful.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wish SO MUCH that more people would understand this. <br/>
<br/>
My just-turned-11 yo has had some tantrums lately - not at home and not over <br/>
us asking her to do things or anything like that. These are happening when <br/>
trying to work on things with some other kids. She&#39;s stamping her feet and <br/>
raising her voice and saying, emotionally, &quot;I&#39;m so frustrated. You aren&#39;t <br/>
LISTENING. I can&#39;t even WORK with you anymore. I GIVE UP.&quot;  Stuff like <br/>
that.... and then bursting into tears and stomping off. Other times it is <br/>
that she has hurt feelings - sometimes not even over what someone has said, <br/>
but just their tone of voice.<br/>
<br/>
One of the other moms sees her outbursts as manipulative attempts to just get <br/>
her own way and has told me that I should &quot;stop letting her get away with <br/>
it.&quot;  I told her that my style is to be kind and understanding at the time <br/>
and then, later, when she&#39;s totally over it - maybe in the car on the way <br/>
home - that that is the time I talk to her about what happened. This other <br/>
mom says, &quot;If it was my kid I&#39;d nail her butt right when it is happening,&quot; <br/>
and she says she thinks it isn&#39;t effective to wait until later to &quot;deal with <br/>
it.&quot; Well - she also said, &quot;She needs to learn to use words,&quot; and I didn&#39;t <br/>
think to say it then, but she IS using words, of course, she isn&#39;t hitting <br/>
anybody or anything like that -- she&#39;s using lots of words - usually starting <br/>
out with, &quot;Listen - are you listening? You aren&#39;t listening.&quot; And then <br/>
escalating into really loud angry emotional words. <br/>
<br/>
Now - naturally - I&#39;m spending some considerable time talking to her <br/>
privately about these outbursts. We talk about how she&#39;s feeling, what kinds <br/>
of things are happening when she starts feeling so explosive, what she&#39;s <br/>
doing when she starts getting frustrated and what ELSE she might try and what <br/>
happens when she explodes and what effect it has on others and all kinds of <br/>
stuff like that.  And I&#39;ve talked to her about being sure SHE is listening to <br/>
the other kids and not ONLY trying to get them to listen to her. And I&#39;ve <br/>
made more effort to get her enough sleep and in not letting her get hungry <br/>
and stuff like that. She does seem to be going through a growth spurt - and <br/>
these periods of disequilibrium have always coincided with growth spurts for <br/>
her. And she&#39;s starting to develop physically - and so are her friends, <br/>
especially one of the girls she has the most trouble with who also has <br/>
similar kinds of screaming/crying meltdowns - so I&#39;m sure hormones are <br/>
involved, as well.<br/>
<br/>
So - how would you handle this?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just the way you are, with loving kindness.  She doesn&#39;t want to feel<br/>
that way about her friends and about herself when it&#39;s all over.  And I&#39;d<br/>
agree with you it probably has a lot to do with hormonal changes and the<br/>
changing dynamics of her friendships if some of the others are going<br/>
through this too.  Being tired or hungry  or sick or hurting has a real<br/>
effect on how we interact with each other so your right on to address<br/>
those things too.  <br/>
Maybe the two of you could come up with something she could do to diffuse<br/>
herself when she starts feeling anxious or stressed or frustrated.  <br/>
Maybe there is a technique she could try to give herself some time to<br/>
calm.  A sort of counting to ten or like smokers do, snap a rubber band<br/>
on their wrist.  ( I don&#39;t really recommend the rubber band thing )  But<br/>
something she thinks would be calming.  <br/>
Part of escalating frustration is not knowing any other way.   <br/>
I know one girl who breaths deeply and swoops her hair away and up like a<br/>
pony tail.  It&#39;s part physical action to redirect the adrenaline and part<br/>
physically cooling.<br/>
Remember that this is a physical thing that&#39;s happening to her and a<br/>
physical action to counter it might be more effective.  People<br/>
instinctively know this which is why, sadly, lots of people who get to a<br/>
highly agitated state physically hurt themselves or someone else.  And in<br/>
old movies when someone is hysterical the hero gives them a good slap. <br/>
Your daughter&#39;s not hitting anyone else, so that&#39;s something!<br/>
I used to have a huge problem with anger and I found the best way for me<br/>
to diffuse it was with regular physical activity.  I run.  When I&#39;m mad I<br/>
run farther! = )<br/>
Maybe this would help your daughter, if she likes swimming or dancing or<br/>
something.  I don&#39;t know.  <br/>
I think the most important thing is that you&#39;re not jumping all over her.<br/>
 I&#39;m sorry about that other mother, but you&#39;re right not to listen to<br/>
her.  Nobody wants to feel this way!   Keep talking to her and telling<br/>
her she&#39;s ok and that she&#39;ll find a more comfortable way to cope.   And<br/>
tell her not to listen to that other mother too, just in case.  <br/>

<br/>
I think your handling it very lovingly and with respect.  You are teaching her<br/>
to deal with her frustrations and anger through communication and your<br/>
also showing her that your do love and respect her when you don&#39;t force<br/>
the communication and then discuss later when she is ready.  Maybe <br/>
then she won&#39;t grow up to be an adult with anger issues, because her mom<br/>
not only didn&#39;t listen but didn&#39;t allow her to express herself.  Keep up the <br/>
communication : )<br/>

&lt;&lt; so I&#39;m sure hormones are <br/>

<br/>
I bet that could be part of the problem Holly has lately just burst into <br/>
tears over what seems nothing, and she herself will just sob &quot;I don&#39;t KNOW <br/>
why I&#39;m crying.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So - how would you handle this? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Distraction.  If she can&#39;t avoid the extended time with those kids, break up <br/>
the time stretch by getting her to help do something somewhere else every <br/>
half hour or so so you could check on her to see if she&#39;s maintaining?  <br/>
That&#39;s my trick with Holly if she&#39;s playing with someone she&#39;s already <br/>
declared will irritate her after a while.  And then I can say &quot;How&#39;s it <br/>
going?&quot; and if she needs to vent to do a reality check moment, or run <br/>
something by me, she can go back to the situation refreshed.  It&#39;s bette than <br/>
her waiting four hours, maybe losing it with the kid, and melting down all <br/>
over everything when they&#39;re gone or she&#39;s home.<br/>
<br/>
I did make recommendations to another mom this morning.  There&#39;s a boy (whose <br/>
sister&#39;s Holly&#39;s friend) who bugs her and has for years.  We&#39;ve been asked to <br/>
give him and his sister a ride a couple of places, coming up--tomorrow and <br/>
then next Wednesday.  Both times, Holly&#39;s face just fell and she had the <br/>
&quot;GOSH I should say yes, but...&quot; look.  So she went to check with her dad <br/>
(who&#39;s driving to swimming) and while she was out of the room, I took the <br/>
phone and told the mom Holly&#39;s having a problem with the boy.  We discussed <br/>
it some.  It was news to the mom.  She threatened to have a long, strong talk <br/>
with him.  I said I thought he might just  need to be asked to be nicer, and <br/>
I said he&#39;s been kinda yucky with me too, when his mom&#39;s not around.  <br/>
Purposely difficult.  And I said Holly didn&#39;t want him to get in big trouble, <br/>
just wanted the mom to be aware.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll see.  I felt bad saying that, but I felt bad letting Holly come to me <br/>
repeatedly and say &quot;I don&#39;t know what to do,&quot; and for all the suggestions and <br/>
new tactics to fail.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I&#39;m off one side of the tightrope, and sometimes off the other.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;ll get older, that&#39;s for sure.  And probably less needy of attention.  And <br/>
Holly knows that.  She&#39;s had lots of longterm friendships that changed for <br/>
the better when the kids were more analytical, verbal, better at sharing.<br/>
<br/>
Today was a rough, rough day here--thing after thing--and the person who <br/>
handled it best (next to Keith, who was home for his first day of a week and <br/>
a half vacation) was Kirby.  Kirby was calm and collected even though his cat <br/>
is sick and we couldn&#39;t get a vet appoinment (and I was ranting about the cat <br/>
peeing on stuff--maybe he has a urinary infection...), and I had gotten Kirby <br/>
up earlier than usual, and his dad wanted him to fold a big tent, but he had <br/>
no shoes on yet and I expressed impatience, and then I made them scrambled <br/>
egg sandwiches and Kirby&#39;s had a spot of mold on the bread (Icut off the <br/>
crusts and he ate the good part, and half of Holly&#39;s--other years he would <br/>
have refused food for hours, whining), and friends of his (Crystal, a <br/>
homeschooled girl from a nearby town, and her brother, both in the SCA) were <br/>
coming for the weekend, and he&#39;d just found out the night before they <br/>
couldn&#39;t come after all... but he was helpful, calm, kind, and smiley.  <br/>
<br/>
I think, but cannot prove, that if I had reacted more strongly to him when he <br/>
was the tantrum king of the family that he wouldn&#39;t be as good a guy today.<br/>

<br/>
Let us know how the boy is tomorrow.  It will be interesting to see how the mom handles this.  <br/>
<br/>
I very rarely have any luck when I talk to moms about their kids.  I used to think it was the way the moms would like me to handle things but have since found out most moms get too defensive and wind up justifying the kid&#39;s behavior.  This usually gives the kid a sense of power over me and the situation and things usually gets worse.<br/>
<br/>
What do you do when a 4 year old spits at you?  This past summer we were at Allison&#39;s softball game and the coaches son spit on Virginia&#39;s chair.  Of course I said, &quot;don&#39;t spit on that chair&quot;, so he spit on me!  I didn&#39;t know what to do so I said to his mother, &quot;excuse me, I need your help, your son is spitting on me&quot;.  She turned to the kid and said, &quot;stop spitting, do you want a spanking?&quot;  The minute she turned around he spit on me again!  One of the other mothers shook the kid by the shoulders and said &quot;CUT IT OUT!&quot;  He stopped.  I&#39;m not about to scream at anyone&#39;s child.<br/>

Is she saying that horrid stuff in front of the kids?<br/>
I think that you answered many of your questions yourself on how to help her<br/>
handle her anger. I think she is doing great and learning how to express<br/>
anger is a long process. I believe that many people don&#39;t allow children to<br/>
express their emotions, and it&#39;s ok to do that. We don&#39;t always have to fix<br/>
everything.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1666669741">Max (2 1/2) has been going through a hitting stage. When he would hit me or<br/>
spit on me or whatever. I would say to him. I don&#39;t deserve to be treated<br/>
that way. With a very firm voice and then get up and walk away.<br/>
He would cry and then come over and try to make up. I would hug him and then<br/>
talk about it with him.<br/>
Now, your situation was a little different because you are not related to<br/>
the child spitting.<br/>
If this was an adult, what would you do? Probably remove yourself from the<br/>
situation. You said. &quot;He knew I wouldn&#39;t do anything&quot; you mean you would<br/>
just sit and take it? Or do you mean you wouldn&#39;t hit or yell? There&#39;s ways<br/>
to respond to someone that teaches them what they are doing is wrong or<br/>
hurtful without yelling. Just like your own kids aren&#39;t yelled at.<br/>
I am always saying to Emily, If he&#39;s bothering you remove yourself! YOu can<br/>
only change one person in life. You.<br/>
I have found that walking away, after saying something like, &quot;I don&#39;t want<br/>
to be around you becasue you are hitting me&quot; and then leaving is VERY<br/>
effective with young children and then the other parent can&#39;t claim you were<br/>
trying to discipline their child (I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve run into the type: &quot;Don&#39;t<br/>
you dare tell my child what to do. That&#39;s MY job!&quot;)<br/>

something and he punched me in the face so hard he<br/>
knocked out one of my teeth.  I don&#39;t remember that my<br/>
parents ever did anything about it, or talked to me<br/>
about it, except to say that I shouldn&#39;t be so sassy<br/>
or seomthing to that affect.  When I was older, the<br/>

places with gangs of young people.  Every one who ever<br/>

It occurs to me now, since I have moved away from<br/>
cities, changed the kind of people in my life and<br/>
grown more, that I have not had a situation where I<br/>
was physically afraid for my safety in some time.  I<br/>
was afraid almost all the time when I was a kid.  I<br/>
guess guess things are different when you grow up in<br/>
an abusive environment.  I am having a hard time<br/>
coming to terms with having boys and the agressive<br/>
ways that they play with each other sometimes.  I am<br/>
very sensative to it and I sometimes get short with<br/>
them about it.<br/>

&gt;you won&#39;t get picked on if you end the problem right<br/>
&gt;there.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>HAHA...I can tell you from personal experience THAT<br/>
doesn&#39;t work.  It just give the kid doing the abusing<br/>
a legitimate (in their mind) excuse for their<br/>
behavior.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1166388854"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I remember when I was 5 and a neighbor kid from down the street was &gt;hassling me.  I said something Like &quot;Go away, this is my yard&quot; or<br/>
&gt;something and he punched me in the face so hard he<br/>
&gt;knocked out one of my teeth.  I don&#39;t remember that my<br/>
&gt;parents ever did anything about it, or talked to me<br/>
&gt;about it, except to say that I shouldn&#39;t be so sassy<br/>
&gt;or seomthing to that affect.  When I was older, the<br/>
&gt;same neighbor sicked his dog on me.  I got beat up in<br/>
&gt;school plenty, because I spoke my mind when others<br/>
&gt;were stepping on me.  I also had plenty of dangerous<br/>
&gt;encounters on the streets, public busses and other<br/>
&gt;places with gangs of young people.  Every one who ever<br/>
&gt;attacked me was male.  I have never been in a physical<br/>
&gt;altercation with a female.<br/>
