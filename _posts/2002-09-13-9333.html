&lt;&lt; I&#39;m wondering what other families have done to satisfy the need for<br/>
 unstructured group activity for the younger set.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Started my own group.<br/>
Mine is for all ages, but you could advertise it as whatever you wanted. <br/>
You&#39;ll get more homeschoolers if you don&#39;t make it age exclusive, because a <br/>
Mom might not come if she has all ages and thinks she can only bring the <br/>
youngers.<br/>
But you could say you&#39;re looking for some younger playmates for a park day, <br/>
or swimming, or hanging out somewhere.....<br/>
Our group had gotten together for a park day once a week, all ages. <br/>
This year, I&#39;ve started a resource day. We have a community center reserved <br/>
for  three hours, once a week. There will be art supplies, sports equipment, <br/>
musical instruments etc... and the kids can hang out and dabble with whatever <br/>
they want.<br/>
If you set it up, you have the advantage of choosing the tone of the group. <br/>
