<div id="ygrps-yiv-1930066879">This morning I was working on my HEM column and needed something from <br/>
upstairs for it, and a URL.  So I hit &quot;log on&quot; and went upstairs.  I was <br/>
singing to myself as I put some dishes in the dishwasher<br/>
&quot;Some folks are fancy on the inside, <br/>
some are fancy on the outside.<br/>
Everybody&#39;s fancy, everybody&#39;s fine<br/>
Your body&#39;s fancy and so is mine.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know why.  It just came into my head.<br/>
<br/>
When I got back down here, the AOL opening screen said &quot;Good Bye, Good <br/>
Neighbor&quot; and had Mr. Roger&#39;s smiling face. He died of cancer this morning.<br/>
<br/>
We were watching the DVD &quot;Kevin Smith speaks,&quot; one of the best parts is <br/>
Silent Bob waiting for people to push &quot;play.&quot;  It&#39;s a long, funny routine on <br/>
each of the two disks, and has live jazz piano.  Soft, subtle, but played to <br/>
his actions.   &quot;Just like on Mr. Rogers,&quot; is what I had told Holly.<br/>
<br/>
We mention Mr. Rogers lots, when talking about puppets, when Lady Aberlin <br/>
played a nun on Dogma, when we sing songs together.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m leaving for the airport in two hours.  I&#39;d like to talk to Holly a bit <br/>
about this, but she&#39;s already said she wanted to sleep late.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Rogers did good work for a long time, and I&#39;m glad there&#39;s video.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-877435570">Yes, I, too, am saddened by the passing of Mr. Rogers, though it <br/>
didn&#39;t move me to tears.  I watched that show when I was a kid, and <br/>
both my DDs watched it.  My youngest and I watched it just this <br/>
morning...He had a guest who had a &quot;fish phone&quot; (a microphone for <br/>
recording the sounds of fish)  he and his guest fed the fish, hoping <br/>
to hear their eating sounds, and the fish just sat there...totally <br/>
still...no sounds at all.  They had to improvise a lot on that show. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I liked the show, for the most part.  He always told the children in <br/>
his audience how special and beautiful they were, and perfect just <br/>
the way they are.  He made a great contribution to childrens <br/>
entertainment.  We watch it on PBS almost every morning.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, it seemed like he had some plastic surgery done on <br/>
his face in recent years, or something...he had this very tight look <br/>
about him that was rather unsettling.  My oldest refuses to watch the <br/>
show now because he just &quot;creeps her out&quot;. Now that I know he had <br/>
cancer, maybe part of that tight, thin wide eyed look was because of <br/>
the disease, or his treatments.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Well, I&#39;m sure there will be Mr.Rogers on PBS for 20 more years...His <br/>
legacy will live on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1909144295">AHA!  That makes sense.  Now it doesn&#39;t seem so &#39;questionable&#39;.  <br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m good that he only found out a few weeks ago that he had cancer.  <br/>
I think that&#39;s a much nicer way to go, not having to suffer for <br/>
years.  Not much comfort, I know.  I knew of a lady that worked with <br/>
my DH at the hospital.  She went to the Dr. with stomach pains that <br/>
wouldn&#39;t go away.  Found out she had severe cancer and died within a <br/>
week.  Very sad, how it can strike seemingly like lightning, though <br/>
I&#39;m sure it grows unnoticed for quite some time.<br/>
<br/>
Just proves how important it is to love each day, love our place on <br/>
this planet each and every moment, and relish the time we have with <br/>
our families and friends.<br/>

Mister Rogers is something that Americans have grown up watching for <br/>
many decades.  He has been around much longer than Sesame Street.  <br/>
Many of us have invited Mr Rogers, with his positive songs delivered <br/>
in his gentle voice, and his neighborhood of kindly friends, into our <br/>
homes every day since early childhood.  His show was basically so <br/>
great, that it remained virtually unchanged throughout it&#39;s <br/>
existance, without every suffering in populatrity.  A true piece of <br/>
Americana is the segment in the beginning of his show where he <br/>
comes &quot;home&quot; to the living room of the set, and changes into his <br/>
trademark red cardigan and canvas sneakers while singing his show&#39;s <br/>
theme song &quot;It&#39;s a Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.&quot;  All in one <br/>
segment he has charmed us with flattery and asked to be friends, made <br/>
himself an accessible and human adult (by changing shoes and sweater) <br/>
and displayed a sense of fun in how he does it.  It&#39;s classic.<br/>

<br/>
Fred McFeely Rogers (1928-2003)<br/>
We are very sorry to deliver the sad news that Fred Rogers died on <br/>
February 27, 2003 after a brief battle with stomach cancer. We are <br/>
grateful for the many people, young and old, who have cared about his <br/>
work over the years and who continue to appreciate Mister Rogers&#39; <br/>
Neighborhood on PBS. We hope that you&#39;ll join us in celebrating his <br/>
life by reflecting on his messages and taking them into your everyday <br/>
lives. <br/>
 <br/>
and<br/>
<br/>
As an educator, songwriter, puppeteer, producer, and children&#39;s <br/>
television programming pioneer, Fred Rogers has entertained and <br/>
educated children for nearly 50 years. Seen daily on public <br/>
television stations across the country, the Mister Rogers&#39; <br/>
Neighborhood series, with its unique approach to helping young <br/>
children learn about themselves and their world, has been recognized <br/>
by educators and early childhood professionals and confirmed by early <br/>
brain research. As the longest running program on public television, <br/>
the Neighborhood series is more important for today&#39;s children than <br/>
ever before. <br/>
<br/>
Lyrics to Theme Song for Mr. Rogers Neighborhood<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a beautiful day in this neighborhood,<br/>
A beautiful day for a neighbor.<br/>
Would you be mine?<br/>
Could you be mine?...<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a neighborly day in this beauty wood,<br/>
A neighborly day for a beauty.<br/>
Would you be mine?<br/>
Could you be mine?...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always wanted to have a neighbor just like you.<br/>
I&#39;ve always wanted to live in a neighborhood with you.<br/>
<br/>
So, let&#39;s make the most of this beautiful day.<br/>
Since we&#39;re together we might as well say:<br/>
Would you be mine?<br/>
Could you be mine?<br/>
Won&#39;t you be my neighbor?<br/>
Won&#39;t you please,<br/>
Won&#39;t you please?<br/>
Please won&#39;t you be my neighbor?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1135597159">I&#39;d add to this that Mr. Rogers&#39; Neighborhood was gentle and <br/>
slow-paced--a safe retreat for toddlers and young kids. Not a lot of <br/>
camera angles or trauma. Adventure, yes: perhaps a tour of a factory or <br/>
something, but gentle and explaining everything.<br/>
<br/>
An interesting thing I noticed about explaining everything was in a Mr. <br/>
Rogers<br/>
book about moving. He specified that we *do* take the kids, and we do <br/>
*not* take the toilet. Who else would have thought to explain that?<br/>

&gt;Fred McFeely Rogers (1928-2003)<br/>
&gt;We are very sorry to deliver the sad news that Fred Rogers died on <br/>
&gt;February 27, 2003 after a brief battle with stomach cancer. We are <br/>
&gt;grateful for the many people, young and old, who have cared about his <br/>
&gt;work over the years and who continue to appreciate Mister Rogers&#39; <br/>
&gt;Neighborhood on PBS. We hope that you&#39;ll join us in celebrating his <br/>
&gt;life by reflecting on his messages and taking them into your everyday <br/>
&gt;lives. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As an educator, songwriter, puppeteer, producer, and children&#39;s <br/>
&gt;television programming pioneer, Fred Rogers has entertained and <br/>
&gt;educated children for nearly 50 years. Seen daily on public <br/>
&gt;television stations across the country, the Mister Rogers&#39; <br/>
&gt;Neighborhood series, with its unique approach to helping young <br/>
&gt;children learn about themselves and their world, has been recognized <br/>
&gt;by educators and early childhood professionals and confirmed by early <br/>
&gt;brain research. As the longest running program on public television, <br/>
&gt;the Neighborhood series is more important for today&#39;s children than <br/>
&gt;ever before. <br/>

&gt;Lyrics to Theme Song for Mr. Rogers Neighborhood<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s a beautiful day in this neighborhood,<br/>
&gt;A beautiful day for a neighbor.<br/>
&gt;Would you be mine?<br/>
&gt;Could you be mine?...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s a neighborly day in this beauty wood,<br/>
&gt;A neighborly day for a beauty.<br/>
&gt;Would you be mine?<br/>
&gt;Could you be mine?...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve always wanted to have a neighbor just like you.<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve always wanted to live in a neighborhood with you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So, let&#39;s make the most of this beautiful day.<br/>
&gt;Since we&#39;re together we might as well say:<br/>
&gt;Would you be mine?<br/>
&gt;Could you be mine?<br/>
&gt;Won&#39;t you be my neighbor?<br/>
&gt;Won&#39;t you please,<br/>
&gt;Won&#39;t you please?<br/>
&gt;Please won&#39;t you be my neighbor?<br/>

&gt; slow-paced--a safe retreat for toddlers and young kids. Not a lot of<br/>
&gt; camera angles or trauma. Adventure, yes: perhaps a tour of a factory or<br/>
&gt; something, but gentle and explaining everything.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I liked the book about going to the hospital and getting surgery.  It <br/>
was one of Lexie&#39;s favorites before a few of her surgeries (this time <br/>
she was a bit old for the book but it was on my list of recommended <br/>
books in my article about kids and surgeries).  I also loved the visit <br/>
to the crayon factory. I think I liked this show more than my kids, <br/>
well, more than Janene.  I will miss him.  <br/>
<br/>
The girls and I were up nearHollywood today on an errand and stopped by <br/>
his star.  There was a huge flower arrangement from the Mayor and a <br/>
balloon arrangement from someone else, a few candles, etc.  Someone had <br/>
put a little stuffed kitty in a sweater and a blue sweater by the star, <br/>
and there were a few notes.  Lexie and Janene wanted to leave something <br/>
too so we went back to our car and found a little finger puppet.  I put <br/>
it on top of the flower arrangement, on the upper most unopened flower. <br/>
Lexie and Janene wrote notes on 5x7 notecards and I wish I would have <br/>
had my camera.  I watched him as a child, on a very small black and <br/>
white tv, and he was important to me.  I always felt like he was telling <br/>
me *I* was special, that *I* was important, and I always wanted to meet <br/>
him.  Sadly that will never happen now.  I had a very difficult <br/>
childhood with friends, who often told me how much I didn&#39;t fit in, and <br/>
Mr. Rogers counteracted that.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; An interesting thing I noticed about explaining everything was in a Mr.<br/>
&gt; Rogers<br/>
&gt; book about moving. He specified that we *do* take the kids, and we do<br/>
&gt; *not* take the toilet. Who else would have thought to explain that?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>not me.  When we had foster kids and were moving, one day I heard a <br/>
bunch of noice in their room.  I went in and they were destroying the <br/>
old dresser I had for them, one I had had as a child.  I had repainted <br/>
it for the kids and they had broken one drawer and were starting on the <br/>
next.  I stopped them and asked what they were doing.  They answered <br/>
matter-of-factly that we weren&#39;t going to get our money back so they <br/>
might as well destroy everything.  They were only five and six, but I <br/>
guess living in furnished apartments and foster homes had made an <br/>
impression.  I had to explain in great detail exactly what we were <br/>
taking with us and what we were leaving behind (the toilets).  They were <br/>
amazed that the furniture and toys could come with them!<br/>

&gt; &gt;Mister Rogers is something that Americans have grown up watching for<br/>
&gt; &gt;many decades.  He has been around much longer than Sesame Street. <br/>
&gt; &gt;Many of us have invited Mr Rogers, with his positive songs delivered<br/>
&gt; &gt;in his gentle voice, and his neighborhood of kindly friends, into our<br/>
&gt; &gt;homes every day since early childhood.  His show was basically so<br/>
&gt; &gt;great, that it remained virtually unchanged throughout it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt;existance, without every suffering in populatrity.  A true piece of<br/>
&gt; &gt;Americana is the segment in the beginning of his show where he<br/>
&gt; &gt;comes &quot;home&quot; to the living room of the set, and changes into his<br/>
&gt; &gt;trademark red cardigan and canvas sneakers while singing his show&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt;theme song &quot;It&#39;s a Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.&quot;  All in one<br/>
&gt; &gt;segment he has charmed us with flattery and asked to be friends, made<br/>
&gt; &gt;himself an accessible and human adult (by changing shoes and sweater)<br/>
&gt; &gt;and displayed a sense of fun in how he does it.  It&#39;s classic.<br/>

cried a lot; I really love the Muppets, and I can remember his puppet work<br/>
from The Ed Sullivan Show.<br/>

Alex watched Nightline with me, and we reminisced about the kid shows he and<br/>
Laura watched.  He confessed they were secret Barney fans &lt;g&gt;  Laura doesn&#39;t<br/>
remember watching Sesame Street or her passion for Elmo, or that she went to<br/>
Sesame Street Live *twice*!  They loved Shining Time Station, too.<br/>

breakfast!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; name? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m late to the discussion.  I read in the newspaper in Saskatoon that it was <br/>
Mr. Rogers&#39; middle name.  The bit about people&#39;s own last names came from an <br/>
interview with Lady Aberlin we looked up (whatever her first real name is) <br/>
and she said they just used the real names of the characters, and didn&#39;t say <br/>
&quot;all but Mr. McFeeley.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In the old shows, he was made up to look older, and he purposely walked like <br/>
an older man.  Over the years they didn&#39;t need so much make-up and acting.<br/>

BA: Thanks to Kevin. That is the unfortunate essence of typecasting. Fred <br/>
used the names of the actors who worked for him. Joe Negri became Handyman <br/>
Negri, Don Brockett became Chef Brockett, and I became Lady Aberlin. Because <br/>
of my name being used, people confused me with that character. The actor <br/>
colors the action of the character, but in my case, there was a melding. <br/>
There is much more to me than Lady Aberlin. I am grateful to be inconspicuous <br/>
in terms of celebrity, so that I can hope to do other work. I don’t think <br/>
I’m compromising Fred Rogers and his ideals. After thirty-three years in The <br/>
Neighborhood, I’m extremely glad to be in Jersey today. [Laughs] -=-<br/>
