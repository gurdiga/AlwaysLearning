<div id="ygrps-yiv-1772011505">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to homeschooling (in fact, my kids aren&#39;t even out of public school yet - I&#39;m pulling them on april 24).  I&#39;m very interested in unschooling, but still having trouble grasping how it works.  I know you&#39;ve spoken extensively on this subject time and again - what would be the best search words to use to find old posts so you don&#39;t have to reiterate everything?  I&#39;m also spending a lot of time going over the Sandra Dodd and Joyfully Rejoycing sites.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I have a question of logistics - I live in CA and will be filing my PSA.  I know I need to keep certain records such as attendance and course of study - how do you keep these types of records?  Is it more after the fact (once they&#39;ve learned something new, then record it) or do your kids choose ahead of time what they want to learn and you put it down?  Or do you not really keep these types of records?  I&#39;m just trying to understand how best to deschool while following the law so we don&#39;t get in trouble.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, that sounds strange, I just don&#39;t completely understand yet.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for your time,<br/>
Linda</div>

I&#39;ve always found this to be helpful when thinking along the lines of<br/>
&quot;school&quot; requirements for homeschoolers:<br/>

<br/>
Your absolute best bet, though, is to find local people doing what you<br/>
are doing and ask them how they comply with the laws.<br/>

This is a State issue. Go here www.hsc.org and then for a CA legal course of <br/>
study go here <br/>

<br/>
Why are you waiting?-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a good question.   I think you should go and get them now, mid- <br/>
day, and bring them home!<br/>
<br/>
Or at least let them stay home tomorrow if they want to.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But on the other hand.... do your kids want to stay home?<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling a child who doesn&#39;t want to be homeschooled creates the  <br/>
same problems school has by &quot;making&quot; kids be there.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So if your kids want to come home, what&#39;s magical about three and a  <br/>
half more school weeks?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-22828639">Thanks for the info!!  I&#39;m waiting until the 24th at the request of my  <br/>
youngest.  There&#39;s a talent show they&#39;re committed to (and really  <br/>
excited for) and my youngest has her &quot;special person&quot; week the  <br/>
20th-24th that she doesn&#39;t want to miss for the world :).<br/>
