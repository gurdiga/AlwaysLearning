He lived in student housing. In the Netherlands, students rent &#39;rooms&#39; in houses or apartments where they have their own bedroom, but share a kitchen and a bathroom. He also received a free public transport card that covered all his train/bus/tram/metro travel in the *entire* country.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This package was available to all students going to any Dutch university, college or trade school. When he was in university, it was available for up to 5 years for a 4 year degree. After this, you could have an interest free (or maybe it was a super low-interest loan) from the government.</div><div><br></div><div>Graham&#39;s parents income was low enough that he qualified for extra government funding. Essentially he had enough funds to cover all his rent and part of his living expenses. He supplemented this by having a part time weekend job and working full time for a few weeks each summer.</div><div><br></div><div>During his university years, there was a bank that offered all students a free national museum card that gave them access to about 400 museums around the country (which he could travel to for free), if you opened an account with them.</div><div><br></div><div>He took a little over 6 years to finish his 4 year degree. He said he was having lots of fun :-) &nbsp;He did an exchange program with Indiana University for a spring semester, and did thesis research in Tanzania, both funded by his University.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>During his last 16 months he went into debt (with his uncle) for about $12,000 (US) because he needed to pay for his own tuition, books, rent and living expenses. He still had a free public transport card, but he now only had a choice of using it during the week or on weekends, but not both.</div><div><br></div><div>Things are different now. He thinks tuition and books would probably cost students around $5000 (US) now, and the money is probably only available as a loan. We&#39;re not sure what the situation will be like when our kids are older, but I doubt it would ever be as expensive as it is in America.</div><div><br></div><div>Rippy</div></div></span></html></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-859392990"><div dir="ltr">Ah, I understand.  I feel bemused when I am confronted with this same thing.  <div><br></div><div>My kids are capable of attaining a college degree--they have the intellectual wiring to do well in a college environment and come out on the other end with a degree. Most of our friends and family expect that college is the GOAL of their homeschooling journey.  </div>

<div><br></div><div>My husband and I had a goal to give our children as many options as we could, to give them as much freedom to figure out what they want to do as possible.  My husband and I went to college (and acquired the debt as well) but we did not feel that we had any other palatable choice at the time.  </div>

<div><br></div><div>My husband has been very successful as is measured by traditional means--money, mostly.  Of course, the money that he makes is sucked up by a lot of debt that we accrued getting to the &quot;goal&quot; of a &quot;good&quot; education.  </div>

<div><br></div><div>We have been kicking this around a lot.  My son is nearing 18 and he is a sensitive-anxious kind of person so he seems to feel as if there is some big deadline coming where he has to CHOOSE--something.  </div>

<div><br></div><div>I am trying to support him, but I have gotten it wrong a couple of times.  I have tried to give him ideas/options about what he could do once he is legally independent.  Initially, because I wasn&#39;t clear about my meaning and intention, he took these suggestions as pressure.  We finally cleared it up and he then felt less pressured.  </div>

<div><br></div><div>I have two kids.  My son (the eldest) is introverted and thoughtful and sensitive, as well as insecure, shy and uncertain.  My daughter has already made a plan and a contingency plan.  She just knows that she will be able to make a way and that she will cope with things as they come.  </div>

<div><br></div><div>I am not entirely certain how to support my son and help him come to some decisions.  He isn&#39;t happy with his uncertainty, and I am trying to assure him that he doesn&#39;t have to have a plan, but I think that he wants to have one.  Any suggestions?</div>

I didn&#39;t apply for international working visas because I needed a &#39;real job&#39; to make enough to pay off my loan.</div><div><br></div><div>When I was back in Canada, I turned down some interesting job offers with non-profits because I was now paying interest on my student loan and I needed to make more money to have enough to pay the loans off.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I only started to relax about my loan when I started working in the private sector. The private sector wasn&#39;t my first choice, but I did not want to be burdened by debt for years and years.</div><div><br></div><div>When I had paid off my debt by about 50%, I felt confident enough that I could take a couple of years to do what I really wanted to do - travel and work odd jobs. My employer offered me a spot back at the company whenever I wanted to return, so I felt it was worth the risk of losing a regular income and going into the unknown.</div><div><br></div><div>I made very different choices when I went to graduate school.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I enrolled in graduate school when I was 28. I knew the reality of what it meant to have an enormous student loan and how much work was required to pay off the loan. I also realized that, for me, my student loan had limited some of my choices and not expanded them.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I decided I did not want any more student loans ever again.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Part of my decision was based on my knowledge that employers like investing in their staff and would offer to fund graduate school. My employer made me such an offer when I was working in the private sector. However, if you make this kind of deal, you most often agree to work for your employer for a certain amount of years. If you leave before your agreed committed time, you opt out of the arrangement by paying your employer back for your student fees. I decided not to do it.</div><div><br></div><div>When I met my husband, Graham, he was keen for me to have a graduate degree (he already had one). We both wanted to work for the UN and the job required a graduate degree. I was confident that I could find a way around this since I had much more work relevant experience than Graham did and great references. I was certain they would love me and possibly even offer to pay for graduate school while I was working for them.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Graham thought I was living in lala land ;-) &nbsp;He convinced a reluctant me to fill out a few applications to Canadian graduate schools. I got in. When the university called me with the &#39;good news&#39;, I calculated the student fees, living costs for two people not working (Graham didn&#39;t have a work visa) and costs of an intercontinental move and balked at what I would need to pay for an 8 month Master&#39;s degree. Not only would we be paying almost $20000, but I would be losing a higher income and Graham would need to withdraw from the interview process with the Ministry of Nature where he was now a serious contender for a policy advisor position.</div></span><span class="ygrps-yiv-1938129971Apple-style-span" style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial;font-size:small;"><div><span class="ygrps-yiv-1938129971Apple-style-span" style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial;font-size:small;"><br></span></div>I told the university that I would not be accepting my spot and they could give it away to the first student on the waiting list. They called me back and offered me a paid position as a Teacher&#39;s Assistant. It would cover about half of our costs. I politely refused again and said I didn&#39;t want to have any loans and I would rather save up for it than do it right now. A few days later they called back and offered me a full scholarship to cover the remaining costs. I had no idea they were going to do this. I hadn&#39;t applied for any scholarships because my heart wasn&#39;t really into it. We still lost out on higher salaries for those 8 months, but at least my student fees, our move and almost all of our living costs were funded by the university.</span><span class="ygrps-yiv-1938129971Apple-style-span" style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial;font-size:small;"><div><br></div><div>Recently a friend of mine with two young children was thinking of going back to university.

Now fees are up to 9,000 UKP a year (think that&#39;s something like 15,000 USD?). Loans are still available, I think still low-interest and only pay back after a certain level.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-629720828"><div dir="ltr"><div><div>One author who challenges the value of college costs (and home ownership, and lots of other things) is James Altucher.</div><div><br></div><div>He&#39;s an entertaining blogger who was college educated and previously worked in computers, investments/finance, made millions, lost it, started businesses and now finds joy writing in very self-deprecating--think Woody Allenish--blog posts where he bares his soul to the world.</div>
<div><br></div><div>He&#39;s also philosophically aligned with Unschooling(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2012/07/how-i-would-unschool-my-kids/">http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2012/07/how-i-would-unschool-my-kids/</a>), but is divorced and has shared custody and so he just brings his &quot;unique&quot; brand of parenting to his daughters in the time they have together. (You have to read more of him to understand where he&#39;s coming from. I&#39;m not 100% endorsing him, but I think he gives a lot of great food for thought on many topics, and I find him pretty hilarious.)</div>
</div><div><br></div><div>He&#39;s been quoted a lot for his opinions on college in all sorts of other publications, because he&#39;s pretty controversial. And gets death threats.</div><div><br></div><div>Here&#39;s where he started talking about college, and runs through a lot of the key numbers to think about when you&#39;re doing the comparison:</div>
<div><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2010/02/dont-send-your-kids-to-college/">http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2010/02/dont-send-your-kids-to-college/</a><br></div><div><br></div><div>which includes part of what Sandra asked about (the $104K was an average 4 year college cost in today&#39;s numbers, which kind of blows my mind. My 4 year degree here in Canada was maybe 35K 15 years ago, and that included a 1 year exchange to Hong Kong and 2 more years in the dorm, one year living back at home.)</div>
<div><br></div><blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-629720828gmail_quote" style="margin:0px 0px 0px 0.8ex;border-left-width:1px;border-left-color:rgb(204,204,204);border-left-style:solid;padding-left:1ex;"><span style="color:rgb(60,60,60);font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:19.59375px;">&quot;If I took that $104,000 and I chose to invest it in a savings account that had interest income of 5% per year I’d end up with an extra $1.4 million dollars over a 50 year period. A full $600,000 more. That $600,000 is a lot of extra money an 18 year old could look forward to in her retirement. I also think the $800,000 quoted above is too high. Right now most motivated kids who have the interest and resources to go to college think it’s the only way to go if they want a good job. If those same kids decided to not go to college my guess is they would quickly close the gap on that $800,000 spread.&quot;</span></blockquote>
