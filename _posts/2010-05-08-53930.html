It seems to me this is one area where unschoolers and radical  <br/>
unschoolers differ in opinion.<br/>
<br/>
John Taylor Gatto, certainly a friend of unschooling, wrote  <br/>
&quot;Television destroys the power to think by providing pre-seen sights,  <br/>
pre-thought thoughts, and unwholesome fantasies.&quot; He didn&#39;t think it  <br/>

<br/>
And it&#39;s good to check when he said what he&#39;s quoted as saying because his views on various things have shifted over the years.<br/>

<br/>
But they didn&#39;t shift from direct experience with unschooling  <br/>
families, and the original statements weren&#39;t made because of direct  <br/>
experience with unschooling, so it didn&#39;t seem like the best thing to  <br/>
quote in a radical unschooling forum.<br/>
<br/>
Some people don&#39;t understand that when questions are asked of other  <br/>
unschoolers, the questioner has found a place like RUNning or this  <br/>
list *because* they want the input of people with unschooling  <br/>
experience.  Quoting dubious experts or offering insipid &quot;support&quot;  <br/>
aren&#39;t what people come for.<br/>

You can make the system an offer it can’t refuse by doing small things, individually.<br/>
You can publicly oppose—in writing, in speech, in actions—anything that will perpetuate the institution as it is. The accumulated weight of your resistance and disapproval, together with that of thousands more, will erode the energy of any bureaucracy.<br/>
You can calmly refuse to take standardized tests. Follow the lead of Melville’s moral genius inBartleby, the Scrivener, and ask everyone, politely, to write: “I prefer not to take this test” on the face of the test packet.<br/>
You can, of course, homeschool or unschool. &quot;<br/>

The towns around me compete against each other for school enrollment.  One town started all day every day kindergarten last year (instead of half day or 3 days a week) and got 5 kids from a neighboring town.  5 kids is a lot around here.  :)  Now THAT town announced it&#39;s going to all day every day kindergarten.  I&#39;m not sure all day every day kindergarten isn&#39;t better than half day or 3 days a week.  Maybe at least with all day every day kindergarten, their parents make an effort to pick them up straight from school (or from the bus...  or BE THERE when they walk home from the bus...) rather than wait until 5 or 5:30 to pick them up from daycare that they get bussed to mid-day.<br/>

to and can do it. Right now,psychologically and socially, that isn&#39;t  <br/>
the case. There are parents who don&#39;t want to. There are parents who  <br/>
want the pathway to a great college that school supposedly offers.  <br/>
There are parents who don&#39;t think they are capable. There are parents  <br/>
whose kids are much better off having that escape from them each day.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-528736443">I don&#39;t know a lot about him as far as speaking at conferences, but I have just finished reading &quot;Weapons of Mass Instruction&quot; and I will say, as a new unschooler, his book definitely has helped me become more convinced that unschooling is the right path for our family.  I think that if someone reads that book that perhaps never considered homeschooling as an option or looked at the world through anything but school colored lenses might come away from reading it with a much greater understanding for people who homeschool or if they chose to homeschool because of it they might skip right over &quot;school at home&quot; to unschooling.  So while I wouldn&#39;t look to him as someone with experience with unschooling and I might not go out of my way to hear him speak, I believe that my journey into unschooling has benefitted from reading this particular book.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, I did also recently read 3 of John Holt&#39;s books and Sandra&#39;s book and I look to seasoned unschoolers&#39; websites and this list for continued wisdom.  I can&#39;t seem to get enough of it these days.</div>

<br/>
But there are many parents who are unfit to unschool.  Not just because they want to have a career.  But because school actually does a better job taking care of their kids than they do.<br/>
<br/>
WANTING to have a career and send your kids to school is not the worst thing ever.<br/>
<br/>
I live this way, but I fully realize that not everyone can, or wants to.<br/>
<br/>
My point is that improving the school system is a much better idea than abolishing it altogether.  It would take a HUGE, and I think impossible, shift in our culture, to make school unnecessary.  I&#39;m not doing anything to improve the school system - that would take time away from my kids, family, my career.  School will evolve to fit the needs of those who need it.  It seems like that means more and more hours in school, more meals served, more academics earlier.  That&#39;s what people who use school want.<br/>

I agree.  Its sad but true.  :)<br/>
and having a choice is always a good thing.  <br/>
but more school hours and meals served  just enables irresponible parents to do even less for their children.  high school is where alot of these parents become parents, and it seems like an endless cycle of people who have no business being parents (at least yet), becoming parents.  I doubt the teen preg rate for homeschoolers (if there even is one :) is near that of pschooled kids.  Public school is causing societal problems as well.  <br/>
but yes, there are those who would just ruin the homeschool thing.  for sure.  I just think at some point people have to be responsible, and unfortunately school doesnt prevent these parents from abuse and neglect. (and alot of school personell are child predators - see 101 reasons to homeschool)   <br/>
We shouldnt create a monster federal government, that we are all subservient to , to deal with those who are unfit to be around their own children.  <br/>

&gt; I don&#39;t really disagree with you.  I work at home.  My husband works at home. We unschool.  It&#39;s awesome, it&#39;s definitely the best way to live.  :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But there are many parents who are unfit to unschool.  Not just because they want to have a career.  But because school actually does a better job taking care of their kids than they do.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; WANTING to have a career and send your kids to school is not the worst thing ever.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I live this way, but I fully realize that not everyone can, or wants to.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My point is that improving the school system is a much better idea than abolishing it altogether.  It would take a HUGE, and I think impossible, shift in our culture, to make school unnecessary.  I&#39;m not doing anything to improve the school system - that would take time away from my kids, family, my career.  School will evolve to fit the needs of those who need it.  It seems like that means more and more hours in school, more meals served, more academics earlier.  That&#39;s what people who use school want.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Having kids is a priority.  Yes I used to work outside the home. Made a very good salary, and had a horrible crazy home life.  I dont anymore.  We reprioritized and put family over the dollar.  If you make some life adjustments it is possible.  Women need to get over the myth that you can have it all .  You cant .  If you work outside the home, your homelife will  suffer. Yes there are single moms, and situations where you have to earn money.  But there are also jobs that can be done from home, etc... . and there are also grandparents, and family that can babysit.  The idea that we have a kid and now someone else needs to be responsible for it baffles me. We are not having a people shortage.  If you dont know how you will possibly take care of or watch your child because your life is too busy and your plate is too full, dont have one.  I know many people who think they are good parents that have no real relationship with their kids, spend hardly any time with them, and get by just skimming the surface in life.   Sad for the kids ,and the future generations.  If people truly thought they would have to raise and educate their own children, less people would probably have them.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Depending on the federal government to provide a place for your child to be, while you are elsewhere, is not acceptable.  <br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; What about all the kids whose parents both work?  They have to go somewhere.  Does he think 5 year olds can stay home by themselves or with siblings?  If he&#39;s expecting people to work together with their neighbors and communities, he&#39;s just living in some fantasy world because that is not going to happen.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; The towns around me compete against each other for school enrollment.  One town started all day every day kindergarten last year (instead of half day or 3 days a week) and got 5 kids from a neighboring town.  5 kids is a lot around here.  :)  Now THAT town announced it&#39;s going to all day every day kindergarten.  I&#39;m not sure all day every day kindergarten isn&#39;t better than half day or 3 days a week.  Maybe at least with all day every day kindergarten, their parents make an effort to pick them up straight from school (or from the bus...  or BE THERE when they walk home from the bus...) rather than wait until 5 or 5:30 to pick them up from daycare that they get bussed to mid-day.<br/>

not that they&#39;re &quot;unfit unschoolers.&quot;  They&#39;re not any kind of  <br/>

If no one else ever unschools EVER, that doesn&#39;t change the fact that  <br/>
I did, that lots of the people on this list did, and are.  It&#39;s not  <br/>
anything that needs more people, or a majority, or approval of the  <br/>
masses, or recognition of &quot;good job.&quot;   It&#39;s one of millions of  <br/>
permutations of choices and opportunities and possibilities.  Someone  <br/>
might be &quot;fit to unschool&quot; in a dozen ways and still not get to be an  <br/>
unschooler, for any of thousands of combinations of reasons.<br/>

Birth control pills have been available to *some* people (not just  <br/>

then, having children had nothing to do with making a responsible  <br/>
choice.   Even now, for the majority of people on the planet, having  <br/>
children is a byproduct of having sex for fun (if they&#39;re lucky and if  <br/>

outside school - you or your kid can choose. Is it like this in the USA? <br/>

I agree there are many people that feel this way. That are against all schools. <br/>
<br/>
However, there is a big difference between people that don&#39;t like schools period and people who believe compulsory public education is wrong. <br/>
<br/>
*I* don&#39;t have any problem with people freely choosing to send kids to any kind type of school they/style want. Montesorri, Christian, Jewish, Alternative, Free School etc etc... <br/>
<br/>
The problem comes when people are *forced* to do so. When it is required by law and the money to pay for the schools are taken by force from another person. And the force is backed up by a guns and the threat of imprisonment. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t believe there is a conspiracy. However, I do think that public education and economics are so entwined that it will be extremely difficult to separate the two for many many years.<br/>
<br/>
Last year, I listened to a conversation in which Dr. Gabor Mate (who is supportive of attachment parenting and helped Gordon Neufeld write his book, &quot;Hold On To Your Kids: Why Parents Matter&quot;) discussed full-day and early Kindergarten programs (for 3 & 4 year olds) with  an policy advisor in Ontario and an academic who has studied ECE in Canada. Ontario and BC are implementing additional Kindergarten programs starting this fall.<br/>
<br/>
The podcast of the interview has been taken down from the CBC site, but what stuck out in my mind was that one of the &quot;experts&quot; in favour of full-day kindergarten (a professor of sociology at the University of Manitoba) was quick to say that it more than paid for itself (something like 1.5x) as it meant that mothers returned to the work force earlier. This person&#39;s opinion has certainly informed public policy.<br/>
<br/>
I found this blurb, although the link to the podcast was down:<br/>
&quot;The province of Ontario is planning to launch a full-day, fully funded child-care and kindergarten program in the fall of 2010. Advocates of early childhood education say the program is long overdue and promises huge payoffs -- that children who attend all day kindergarten will be more likely to get a post-secondary education and have higher earning potential, in addition to being less likely to fall into crime.&quot; I recall that Dr. Mate urged the policy makers to look at the statistics for Sweden (more about Sweden here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.stratletter.com/dec10speech.html)">http://www.stratletter.com/dec10speech.html)</a> as what&#39;s happening in that country, as a result of a state-funded early childhood program, does not support those supposed long term payoffs.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who is into social ecology who sees homeschooling as elitist (only for those who can afford to do it). I don&#39;t agree with him as I&#39;ve seen parents from all sorts of socioeconomic backgrounds successfully homeschooling their kids, but I can understand why many people don&#39;t think they can &quot;afford&quot; to do it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-784130234"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Then why have schools thrived? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thrived in what way? Part of the reason they thrive is that &quot;indoctrination&quot; piece. I hate that word though because it&#39;s so in your face and I think it&#39;s actually much more subtle than that. People who teach in the schools are generally (at least where I live and grow up) all very liberal-minded...the general belief is that schools are good or at least trying to be good and above all needed and noble. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Who or what is the force behind public <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The people with the guns who demand the tax money to pay for them and the truant officers and DCYF workers who will take your kids if you don&#39;t prove they are being schooled. I know that sounds dramatic...but in reality that is what happens.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; schools? What&#39;s this force&#39;s goal?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t claim to know. I can think of a number of possibilities. <br/>
<br/>
Some people really believe they are doing right by the children. <br/>
Raising adults who are pro-government...pro-various causes. <br/>
Raising citizens who are not independently-minded.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Joyce,<br/>
<br/>
sorry for my last post, but it made me feel quite angry how you <br/>
misunderstood me. It felt like you were really trying hard to put me in <br/>
a fascist concpiracy theoritics corner.<br/>
With the type of community college you described we are not to far from <br/>
one another :)<br/>
You asked, what&#39;s the force&#39;s goal. I think the goal of &quot;the force&quot; is <br/>
to conserve existing structures. And this is not one &quot;club&quot; like the <br/>
illuminati or so, but a sociological trend. Big systems organize around <br/>
each other and reinforce each other. So if one of the big systems <br/>
changes to much and to fast, the other systems may crumble. E.g. public <br/>
health couldn&#39;t work like it does now, if you abolish schools tomorrow - <br/>
because they are interconnected. Additionally you have customs and <br/>
tradition and the like, that &quot;indoctrinate&quot; you (you have to read the <br/>
indoctrinate like in Monroe-Doctrine) .<br/>
But if they change slowly, then they can mutually adapt. Taking schools <br/>
of the table was (as far as I know) first thougt of by Buckminster <br/>
Fuller in the 1960s and since then more and more are sharing that goal. <br/>
And it is evolving quite fast in the USA - as far as I see. But it could <br/>
be a bit faster, if parents would get the same funding and support for <br/>
having their children in as outside of school. I think as soon as the <br/>
schoolfree movement will grow above 5% or 6% they can claim equal <br/>
funding and then politicians will be very aware of that claim.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; from platons fascist dreams to nowadays mass indoctrination.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Who&#39;s platon?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Plato was an old greek philosopher, who examined the spartan school <br/>
system and constructed it as the basis of a philosophers state which <br/>
should follow the instable democracy (in those days democracy tumbled <br/>
into tyranny every few decades). He is one of the most influential <br/>
political thinkers and lot of politician scientists will tell you that <br/>
all political science is just a footnote to plato.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; And it sounds like you want to mass indoctrinate everyone into<br/>
&gt; believing schools are bad. You want to yank schools away from people<br/>
&gt; who are freely choosing them. Sounds like a fascist dream to me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If I meet someone who is *freely* choosing school, then he/she shall <br/>
have it, anything else would be fascist. But we have to stand up for the <br/>
free choice - as explained above.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that clarifies what I meant and takes the radical edge out of our <br/>
misunderstanding (as far as it was one).<br/>

OK. You live in the United States and enjoy the benefits of living here.<br/>
Paying taxes is part of the social contract of living in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
You are not being &quot;forced&quot; to do anything. You are choosing to live here.<br/>
You could choose to live somewhere else.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;guns and threat of imprisonment&quot; is the basis of enforcement of any<br/>
complete social system. Even if libertarians reduced all laws to &quot;don&#39;t<br/>
commit fraud or initiate force&quot;, how would they enforce that? I suspect it<br/>
might be with guns and the threat of imprisonment.<br/>

<br/>
This is the red herring often thrown out in such arguments. &quot;You are not patriotic! If you don&#39;t like it leave!!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
+++You are not being &quot;forced&quot; to do anything. You are choosing to live here.<br/>

<br/>
Would you apply this same logic to a child? How about a teen? If they don&#39;t like the rules of the home they are living in should they just leave? Are parents justified in making any such rules and punishments they deem fit including spanking as part of a familial contract?<br/>
<br/>
When you are born into a family are you not living under a familial contract? Shouldn&#39;t you then abide by those rules? <br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1512951245">-=Can&#39;t parents learn to<br/>
do a better job than school? Can&#39;t politics concentrate more funds on<br/>
enabling parents instead of funding school? I think even a world<br/>
completely without school is possible. It&#39;s a dream that can come true.<br/>
But we have to think differently! Schools are a bad thing - and they<br/>
always were - from platons fascist dreams to nowadays mass  <br/>
indoctrination.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is all political and not the purpose of this group discussion.    <br/>
There are a lot of  &quot;possible world&quot; imaginings, but then there is the  <br/>
real world that defies anyone&#39;s imagination.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Can&#39;t parents learn to  do a better job than school? -=-<br/>
<br/>
Very few want to even think about that.  Most parents don&#39;t think they  <br/>
can do a better job than school.  They don&#39;t WANT to learn to do a  <br/>
better job than school.<br/>
<br/>
So the answer to that question, for me, is that some can and some  <br/>
can&#39;t.  Those who can&#39;t aren&#39;t the topic of this list, and those who  <br/>
want to try are here to discuss natural learning and unschooling with  <br/>
other unschoolers.<br/>

These notes are to various bits of the discussion:<br/>
<br/>
I had already sent back a response to this thread yesterday for being  <br/>
all politics and no unschooling.  I went to sleep (as I do, each   <br/>
night) and this morning the list is full of a big political discussion  <br/>
that&#39;s gone all mean.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Platon&quot; isn&#39;t &quot;Plato.&quot;  Joyce would have known who &quot;Plato&quot; was.<br/>
Germans have no excuse not to capitalize names.  Clarity in writing is  <br/>
one of the requirements for posting here (for being allowed to  <br/>
continue to post, anyway).<br/>
<br/>
There haven&#39;t been &quot;truant officers&quot; for decades, if there ever were.   <br/>
It&#39;s a boogeyman.<br/>
