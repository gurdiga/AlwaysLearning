<div id="ygrps-yiv-170749719">The process is called &quot;telecine&quot; [pron: telly - sin - ee] - basically <br/>
someone projects the film and then shoots it on the screen with a video <br/>
camera so that it is now in digital format. There should be facilities that <br/>
do it near you. I&#39;d try looking up (google or the yellow pages) Film Post <br/>
Production studios and asking them about it.<br/>
