<div id="ygrps-yiv-1583471327">(newbie here, haven&#39;t done an intro yet, but hope you don&#39;t mind me responding)<br/>
We do this sort of thing quite a bit, off and on - rather than buying something special, if you have muffin tins, they work very well.  Or you could use several different small tupperware dishes.  :)<br/>
(DS doesn&#39;t like his food mixed up, he&#39;s 2.5, the muffin trays keep everything seperated though, and offer room for lots of variety)<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
****I&#39;m going out this weekend to try to find a divided tray something like this one:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon">http://www.amazon</a> com/Fit-Fresh- Fruit-Veggie- Bowl/dp/B000FNEV QQ/ref=wl_ it_dp_o?ie= UTF8&coliid= I2T9S1KVX2V0FL& colid=35A4BGD0LM MYT<br/>
I am going to try to take myself out the the equation as much as possible by keeping two (one room temp, one cold) monkey platters available.  I&#39;ll have the kids pick some foods and add some of my own I think they will like.  I will still make and offer other foods.  <br/>

I have made monkey platters in all sorts of dishes in the past.  What I want now is a dish with a lid so I can put leftovers back in the fridge, or covered up for another time.  It also would make it easier for the boys to get it for themselves.  I am thinking of constantly keeping them filled and letting the boys grab them at will.<br/>
<br/>
When I do them on the weekend for lunch when John and I both are home, everything usually gets eaten.  When I make them just for the boys, they are much more likely to nibble.  <br/>

Or this one from Target. It also keeps food cold for 4 hours outside  <br/>
of the fridge.<br/>

If I were looking for something like this, I would go to Target or Walmart - <br/>
one of the big discount department stores - and look through the kitchen <br/>
ware and home storage departments.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1558602613">A discussion of storage containers for leftover monkey platter meals  <br/>
isn&#39;t the best use of the list.  I also think leftovers, in general,  <br/>
might not be in keeping with the glorious gift a monkey platter can  <br/>
be.  If you&#39;re going to use leftovers, at least rearrange it and  <br/>
spruce it up.   Many people have been punished by having leftover food  <br/>
brought out at the next meal, and although not all people have that  <br/>
association, it&#39;s pretty common.<br/>
<br/>
So in practical terms, this isn&#39;t a list to discuss plastic containers.<br/>
<br/>
In philosophical terms, I object to the special container  use  <br/>
whatever plastic wrap you have and arrange it newly next time, or put  <br/>
the leftovers into a casserole or soup or send them with your husband  <br/>
for part of his lunch.   Make a new monkeyplatter next time.<br/>
