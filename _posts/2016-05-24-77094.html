<div id="ygrps-yiv-270186166">I think many of these experiences with living in a foreign country do illustrate some of the additional layers of frustration and self doubt that can result. However, since both spouses are non natives of the country, it would seem that these struggles wouldn&#39;t be unique to one spouse over the other.  Some of the cultural challenges that present in a workplace can be different than those faced by a stay at home parent, but many of them overlap. Some people would struggle regardless of their country of residence or how much support of family or friends they receive. <br/>
I don&#39;t know the &quot;right&quot; path forward for the poster or her family.  In reading the responses though, I felt this point above was worth mentioning. For what it&#39;s worth, both my husband and I grew up outside the US, in different countries from each other, we met in the US in college, and have moved for his job to 2 other very culturally different countries as well. I can relate to the difficulty of life in a new, unknown culture. <br/>
Maybe the husband should spend a few months back in his home country and would perhaps see the darkness follows him and isn&#39;t because of his wife or where they live? <br/>
I hope things improve for them. <br/>

Although there was a proposal to move to a third country, I think they are in the mom’s country now.<br/>

And he might miss her, and he might be able to gather his thoughts better if he’s in a more familiar place.<br/>
And the wife might miss him, and reconsider whether it’s worth moving, as she had agreed to do.<br/>
