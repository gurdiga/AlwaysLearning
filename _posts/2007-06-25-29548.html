<div id="ygrps-yiv-1943421182">Thank you everyone for the ideas and encouragement.  I talked with Natalie today and found out the problem is that she does not want to take the time to put on clean clothes.  She does not want to stop doing what she is doing to go change.  I talked about how people might think I was not taking care of her if she walks around in dirty clothes outside the house and she understood.  I am working on different ways to make the transition easier....when she is done with one thing, but before moving on to the next....telling her we will pause the game or movie or whatever we were doing.  We will see how it goes.  Thanks again<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-676214833">Maybe a closet organizer with a few slots in it and an outfit in each spot<br/>
so she doesn&#39;t have to look for an outfit.. its already there and ready for<br/>
her.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-871398869">Thank you for this discussion.  I have been having this problem with <br/>
my 4 year old girl.  I am trying really hard to not shame her, but I <br/>
do have a big reaction.  For me, I think I have trouble because I <br/>
don&#39;t know how much of it bothers me because she was molested almost <br/>
a year ago and how much is just me being a very &quot;normal&quot; bothered <br/>
because it&#39;s inappropriate.  I tell her that it&#39;s her body, but she <br/>
can&#39;t play with herself in front of anybody.  I tell her that in <br/>
private it&#39;s fine.  It&#39;s hard to know if saying something is private <br/>
is shaming or not.  Child molesters sometimes say things like &#39;let&#39;s <br/>
keep this private&#39; and such.  I really don&#39;t know how strong my <br/>
reaction comes across to her, when she touches herself I am overcome <br/>
with grief over what happened to her.  It&#39;s hard not to think that <br/>
one is related to the other.  It&#39;s good to read that it&#39;s fairly <br/>
normal and that it&#39;s good to have a fairly normal &quot;that&#39;s <br/>
innapropriate&quot; reaction.  <br/>
I don&#39;t want to teach her that bodies are bad in anyway.  Well, this <br/>
is pretty choppy writing, but it&#39;s so emotionally charged that I have <br/>
some trouble with it.  So, thanks for all the posts.  It has helped <br/>
me a lot.<br/>
<br/>

Maybe say &quot;by yourself&quot; then instead of &quot;private.&quot;<br/>
Or &quot;When you&#39;re alone.&quot;<br/>
