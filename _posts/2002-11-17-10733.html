<div id="ygrps-yiv-1009263860">I went and looked.  Found three names, two we had thought of and one (good <br/>
one!) we hadn&#39;t.  These all dated from between late October and November 7, <br/>
and NONE might be right:<br/>
<br/>
-------------<br/>
<br/>
The Dark Horizons Web site reported that Peter O&#39;Toole is the latest actor <br/>
rumored to be in line to replace the late Richard Harris as Professor <br/>
Dumbledore in the upcoming third Harry Potter movie, The Prisoner of Azkaban<br/>
<br/>
---------<br/>
<br/>
Veteran actor Christopher Lee (Lord of the Rings) confirms he is in talks to <br/>
replace the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore in the third Harry Potter film. <br/>
Speaking on his Official Website, the actor&#39;s spokesperson confirmed rumours <br/>
of a Lee-Dumbledore. <br/>
<br/>
------<br/>
<br/>
There should probably be a rule about being involved in too many <br/>
franchises... <br/>
<br/>
While we know Christopher Lee as Saruman in &quot;Lord of the Rings,&quot; as one of <br/>
the original Draculas, and also Count Dooku in &quot;Star Wars,&quot; it was rumored a <br/>
few weeks ago that Lee may be tapped to play Dumbledore in the next &quot;Harry <br/>
Potter&quot; movies. <br/>
<br/>
Now, the NY Daily News adds a new name to the list: Ian McKellen. Yes, <br/>
Gandalf from &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; and Magneto from &quot;X-Men.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
McKellen&#39;s representatives would not comment on the story. <br/>
<br/>
------<br/>
<br/>
Peter O&#39;Toole is OLD, though!  But he&#39;s TALL!<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s 70. and 6&#39;3&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Christopher Lee:  <br/>
80 years old and 6&#39;5&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ian McKellan, shortest (bad) but youngest (good, if they want to go for four <br/>
more films)<br/>
5&#39;11&quot;, but not born until 1939, so he&#39;s only 63?</div>

aristocratic englishman who has his American teenage daughter <br/>
come to stay in his posh house. He hasn&#39;t seen her for years.<br/>
He looks good in it but the CA teen is irritating beyond belief. Just <br/>

<br/>
I *so* loved the Simpson&#39;s episode where they fall asleep during the sermon <br/>
because the air conditioning went out in the building, and each dreams a <br/>
Bible story.  Marge&#39;s is the garden of Eden, and God (Ned&#39;s voice) says &quot;You <br/>
are SO BANISHED&quot; as he thumps her over the wall with his finger.<br/>
<br/>
In one of the commentary CDs about lord of the rings, Viggo Mortensen is <br/>
telling a story, but he leaves off the last work or phrase a couple of times, <br/>
which is like, you know.  I wonder if someone were putting captions on <br/>
something like that, even for foreigners (like kiwis and aussies) whether it <br/>
would be good to put the left-out part in brackets.  He said something like <br/>
&quot;Like when you&#39;re driving, and someone&#39;s watching, and you start to over-c-&quot;  <br/>
and he went on to another phrase without finishing &quot;over-compensate.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
All those &quot;so...whatever&quot; phrases would have an understood second phrase.  So <br/>
whatever that... but it trails off American style.  It&#39;s like a set-up line <br/>
without the punch line because the punchline is too routine.<br/>

<br/>
It followed one for The Two Towers, which was awesome; after American Girl&#39;s<br/>
trailer, a gruff male voice from the front of the theater said &quot;I can&#39;t wait<br/>
