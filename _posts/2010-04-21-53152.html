Sandra,  I thought I was slammed pretty bad on the list.It looked to  <br/>
me that Pam made it look like my son was sexually abused and that was  <br/>
so far off. People from all over the world will read that reply and we  <br/>
look bad.(at the time,I thought this) I was extremely embarrassed then  <br/>
angry and went off and vented. I got off the list before becoming more  <br/>
upset. What I did wasn&#39;t honorable. I understand Pam wasn&#39;t accusing  <br/>
that and I understand why you didn&#39;t let that post through..glad ya  <br/>
didn&#39;t. Tell Pam I was &quot;shocked&quot; and it did work. I understand why she  <br/>
did it.<br/>
<br/>
There was a statement(can&#39;t remember who wrote it)that said&quot;she  <br/>
doesn&#39;t listen any better than her son&quot;<br/>
With that I got it. Yes..humbly..I have been asking for years not  <br/>
listening. I am sorry for calling Pam a name. Please tell her. I feel  <br/>
bad how you were talked about. Thank you all for handling my &quot;over  <br/>
there&quot; rant with grace. I don&#39;t think that will ever happen again.<br/>
<br/>

I do appreciate the note and will pass it on to Pam.....<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to put this on the list if you would let me, or would like to  <br/>
invite you to do it if you&#39;re willing.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

Sure...you can put the whole thing on the list. I have to rejoin to  <br/>
get back on right?<br/>

<br/>
Note to the list, follow-up.<br/>
I invited her back on the list, but she had said she was going to read  <br/>
to Lukas and might not get back online until tomorrow, so I&#39;m blind  <br/>
copying her on this post.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Heather.<br/>

Maybe we should take a poll about how many of us have quit an unschooling list in a huff...and eventually come back. (sheepishly raises hand) Most of us don&#39;t flame out that spectacularly but a number of us have been there!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks Heather. It takes a TON of guts to make that kind of apology, and <br/>
I&#39;m grateful and impressed!<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there. We know that what you want is joy and peace with your son!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sending this offlist, too, since I&#39;m not sure Heather is back <br/>
reading here right now.<br/>
