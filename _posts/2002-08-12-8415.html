&gt;What I don&#39;t like about it is that it is only for girls, not their <br/>
&gt;families.  I have a daughter who wants to have fun meeting girls her <br/>
&gt;age but of course I always have to have my boys tag along with me and <br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t want them only hanging out with girls.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Maybe we could create our own unschool-family friendly-non <br/>
&gt;authoritarian scout group!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1384166379">I used to participate in my brother&#39;s Boy Scout<br/>
activities.  Even the Order of the Arrow things.<br/>
<br/>
I was also a Brownie leader at age 15...had my own<br/>
troop of little girls, in Oregon. We were pretty<br/>
relaxed. Did a lot of hiking and singing and helped<br/>
them learn to use pocket knives, make fires, other<br/>
forbidden stuff. :-). I had fun vicariously extending<br/>
and enhancing my childhood through other little girls<br/>
and my little sister, Little Sister was too little to<br/>
be a Brownie, then, so taking care of her was part of<br/>
the game.  My bothers helped out some, too. They kept<br/>
falling in love.<br/>
<br/>
That was the Olden Days, though.<br/>
