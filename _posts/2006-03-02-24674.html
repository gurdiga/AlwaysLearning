<div id="ygrps-yiv-1676109247">Joy is going to the store to buy a new snapset swimming pool because  <br/>
it&#39;s too warm for anything else. Joy is stopping to get pizza and  <br/>
having an impromptu picnic at the park, complete with feeding the  <br/>
geese. Joy is building most of a tree house. Joy is creating &#39;mud  <br/>
world&#39; when the pool gets boring, and not having mom freak out. Joy  <br/>
is having the only backyard on the block that&#39;s not landscaped and  <br/>
can be dug up at will. Joy is making pirate flags and pretending to  <br/>
be the bad guy so Sam can win. Joy is seeing Emily ace her Tae kwon  <br/>
Do test, and have the confidence and wisdom to reassure her (much  <br/>
older) classmates. Joy is teaching an unknown child how to knit while  <br/>
at said class. Joy is winning the bid, on behalf of the kids, of an  <br/>
eight-foot 3D Narnia cardboard wardrobe. Not to mention transporting  <br/>
it home and setting it up in the dining room because there is no  <br/>
other place it will fit. Today has been (in the immortal wisdom of  <br/>
Bill and Ted) &#39;a most excellent day&#39;. Joy is staying up late after  <br/>
the kids are asleep to clean up all the happy messes from the day,  <br/>
and strew some fun for tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
My old tapes are getting worn out. That&#39;s my joy.<br/>
