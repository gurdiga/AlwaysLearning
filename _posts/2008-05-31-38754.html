<div id="ygrps-yiv-1799341550">I am wondering what recommendations you would have for a family who has a child with a significant learning/developmental delays, who does not function in the same manner as the other children in the family.<br/>
<br/>
We are a long-time home learning family (since 1988) with eight children, four still at home.  The younger four are internationally adopted (China) and are 15, 13, 12 and 11 year old girls.   Our fifteen year old, who joined our family at age 6.5 years, has significant learning/developmental issues that have baffled us since her adoption in 1999.     Some basic conclusions we&#39;ve reached after lots of consultation with therapists in an effort to find out what is going on is that she has a profound language processing disorder complicated by a low-IQ.  Now, I have got to say that I am not someone who puts a whole lot of stock in IQ tests.     Nor do I have a lot of faith in therapists.    But, given our long-time experience in parenting, homeschooling, and international adoption, this child has baffled us.    She struggles with learning things that were never problems for any of the other kids, and she presents to the world as a child with major problems, but she doesn&#39;t fit any mold that we can easily understand.    We have been reluctant to submit her to too much testing, because we don&#39;t want to add to her already evident insecurities.   We do suspect that she may have had a brain injury at some time before her adoption based on the type of language problems she experiences, and there is more we will never know because of lack of knowledge of her biological family&#39;s health issues, her birth history, and her life prior to her entering the orphanage in China when she was three years old.    <br/>
<br/>
But we struggle about how to help her move toward a time when she might hope to live somewhat independently.   If she were clearly developmentally delayed, it would be obvious that she would not be able to live independently and we would be looking towards some type of sheltered work/living environment.    But she&#39;s not in that category.    If she were in school, she would probably be diagnosed as a slow learner (possibly borderline retarded, but more likely slightly above that level), with a huge language processing disorder.   Our primary therapist has said we should not consider public school ever because our daughter would fall into a huge gap area of lack of service.    The speech pathologists we&#39;ve seen have said that the low IQ severely complicates any hope of making much progress on the language processing disorder.   <br/>
<br/>
She does not &quot;learn&quot; in the way that the other kids learn.   She doesn&#39;t pick things up by normal exposure in an active, involved family.    Even clear instruction isn&#39;t working in many areas.   For example, she&#39;s never been able to learn to handle money.    Lots of board games, lots of exposure to the use of money in shopping, hasn&#39;t clicked.   She can&#39;t grasp the concept of time......she can tell the time with a digital clock but not grasp how much time elapses during activities.    Example:  if you go to a two-hour movie that starts at 4 p.m., when will the movie be over?   If she has $5 in her wallet and the movie costs $6, does she have enough money to go to the movie?    And she&#39;s 15.<br/>
<br/>
She is very much a 15 year old, interested in boys, music, fashion.   But she lacks discernment that I would expect to find in a much younger child, so I am reluctant to allow her reasonable activities I would expect a much younger child to be able to handle.    Internet access terrifies me, because of her lack of judgment.    <br/>
<br/>
So, my question is, how do any of you who have children who fall far below what could be considered typical in development and ability to handle things?<br/>
When you can&#39;t trust the automatic growth that we see with our other kids, how do you deal with life?    Do you find that some children need more concrete instruction......and I have to say here that our efforts at being more formal with this child are of mixed results........and do you find that some children need more from &quot;professionals&quot; than you would consider normally?     Are any of you parenting children who have severe learning issues related possibly to brain damage?  What do you do with the child who has such serious learning problems that you despair of their being  able to live independently, yet the child would be out of place in a sheltered workshop?<br/>
<br/>
A few extra things......This young lady takes dance (ballet, tap, modern, hip-hop) at a local school where she is well liked on a superficial level.   By this I mean she chatters away with lots of the other girls, but they don&#39;t include her in any of their other activities because they recognize her differences.<br/>
She chatters quite a bit, but she has difficulty following true conversations.     She reads age-appropriate books, her ability to &quot;read&quot; is ok, but her comprehension is lacking.   She can&#39;t discuss the books she reads.     She also can&#39;t discuss movies or tv shows, even those that she seems to be very interested in.   This falls into the language problem, and we&#39;re not sure where in the brain the comprehension lags.......does she understand what she reads and watches but can&#39;t put her understanding into words, or does she not understand at any level and is just mimicing enjoyment?    She can&#39;t play games that require any strategizing.     She can do basic household tasks (setting table, washing dishes, making beds) but she can&#39;t handle the washing machine because of an inability to comprehend the organizational side of that (how hot do you want the water, what items require special handling?)    I can&#39;t have her go into a grocery store with a list and get what is on the list and pay, even though she goes shopping with me and I talk through the process in an effort  to get her to figure out what I&#39;m doing, yet she has clear preferences on types of food and brands.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1778562548">I am the mom of an autistic son, and I am friends with another mom <br/>
who unschools the rest of her family, but has come to some of the <br/>
same conclusions I did regarding our autistic kids.  Pure <br/>
unschooling for them just wasn&#39;t working for our auties.  When I <br/>
went to read what John Holt had to say on the subject, the example <br/>
that was given of homeschooling an autistic child was not <br/>
unschooling, it was more traditional, structured homeschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, I have found that a traditional curriculm does not work very <br/>
well either because it has to be very visual and very hands on.  <br/>
Right now we are putting some of the traditional academics aside to <br/>
try and work on his various language processing issues and self help <br/>
skills.  <br/>
<br/>
The issue you described, where the reading level (word attack, <br/>
phonics, ect) is considerably above their comprehension is <br/>
termed &quot;hyperlexic&quot;.  It occurs in autism some of the time, but <br/>
isn&#39;t exclusive to autism.  (you can be hyperlexic and not <br/>
autistic).  It is related to dyslexia, sort of it&#39;s opposite.  I <br/>
found a program recently that targets comprehension <br/>
called &quot;Visualizing and Verbalizing&quot; by Nancy Bell.  Working on <br/>
comprehension and sequencing is a huge part of what I do with my <br/>
ds.  <br/>
<br/>
I have found that he really struggles with auditory <br/>
processing/language processing, but can understand visual supports a <br/>
lot better, so I do a LOT of visual supports.  You can find a lot of <br/>
information on PECS (Picture Exchange Communication), which can be <br/>
used with totally non-verbal kids, but are also really useful for <br/>
verbal, but with difficulty with language processing.  I use them a <br/>
lot to make picture schedules, social stories (although I don&#39;t do <br/>
them the &#39;standard&#39; way, for me it is basically taking the task and <br/>
breaking it down into the smallest possible pieces, like &quot;spit in <br/>
sink&quot; is one of the tasks for the &quot;brushing teeth&quot; story, and &quot;look <br/>
at face&quot; is a task in the &quot;how to say hi&quot; story), and visual to-do <br/>
lists.  <br/>
<br/>
I have had good luck with Miquon Math (uses Cuisinairre Rods) <br/>
because it depends much more on visual than most of the other math <br/>
programs I have seen.  It is often used for remedial math and isn&#39;t <br/>
dumbed down or obviously for young kids, so that might be a plus for <br/>
you.  <br/>
<br/>
A lot of what you are describing are issues that a lot of autistics <br/>
face, so googling info on homeschooling and autism or autism <br/>
learning sites might help, even if it isn&#39;t an exact fit.  <br/>
<br/>
If you do think that autism might fit, you might look at <br/>
Greenspan&#39;s &quot;Engaging Autism&quot; a bit.  Both me and my friend have <br/>
found the methods they use to address some of the issues to be <br/>
really compatable to living an unschooling lifestyle.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if I can be of any help.  My child is younger, <br/>
but it sounds like some of the issues are similar.<br/>
<br/>
I apologize if my post seems disjointed.  My 2yo is having a rough <br/>
day and this window has been open for hours as I tried to write a <br/>
sentence here and there and I want to get this sent before <br/>
midnight.  lol<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-466734971">Gee I must have been hyperlexic.  I guess if I couldn&#39;t have been dyslexic<br/>
---then hyper I could have... :)   Probably one of the few ways I could have<br/>
been considered hyper.  At any rate, I was put through a lot of hooey over<br/>
the difference for how I read in school.  Somehow I managed to ignore the<br/>
hoopla.  Being very hard of hearing often has its advantages, especially<br/>
when people want to tell you what you are/aren&#39;t.  My mom and dad knew I was<br/>
a voracious reader so they ignored the hoopla (good on them and me!).<br/>
<br/>
Consider making reading enjoyable as it can be for children by not imposing<br/>
external opinions on it.<br/>

Instead of looking to homeschoolers and others who are already  <br/>
convinced unschooling doesn&#39;t work, I&#39;d look for unschoolers who are  <br/>
certain unschooling can work and are finding ways to make it work.<br/>
<br/>
If you feel what you have works for your family, there&#39;s little I can  <br/>
say that will make a difference. But it might make a difference to  <br/>
others with atypical children whose fears were sparked alive by what  <br/>
you wrote and are now thinking they need some program.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What do you mean by &quot;work&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
It suggests a goal with a deadline. That&#39;s one of the concepts  <br/>
unschoolers need to let go of for natural learning to flourish. It  <br/>
can be hard for unschoolers to see a 12 yo who is not reading. It  <br/>
helps a lot to know that many unschooled kids -- though not all and  <br/>
not the majority! ;-) -- have passed through that and do eventually  <br/>
read fine.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard being a pioneer. Often the only friends a pioneer has are  <br/>
their certainty and determination. But for those who lack what&#39;s  <br/>
necessary to be pioneers themselves, the pioneers are often happy to  <br/>
help others who follow in the trail they&#39;ve blazed. The pioneers are  <br/>
out there.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>An unschooling approach isn&#39;t to work on skills. Which shouldn&#39;t be  <br/>
interpreted as doing nothing. Unschoolers incorporate their help into  <br/>
their kids lives as issues come up. They give their kids some help  <br/>
before an event where they know from past experience the child might  <br/>
have difficulties in. They give help during the event. They talk  <br/>
about it afterward. Being there to help and support is a seamless  <br/>
part of life.<br/>
<br/>
The big difference is they aren&#39;t seeing their child as needing to be  <br/>
at x level of competency so they need to work with the child, but  <br/>
they will see a child struggling to do something and step in with the  <br/>
offer of some other tools that might work better. (And one tool might  <br/>
be to leave and try again some other time.) Rather than moving a  <br/>
child to a goal the mother feels is necessary, the approach is &quot;I&#39;m  <br/>
here to help.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The issue you described, where the reading level (word attack,<br/>
&gt; phonics, ect) is considerably above their comprehension is<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Whether or not they&#39;re recognizing words, if they aren&#39;t  <br/>
comprehending, they&#39;re not reading.<br/>
<br/>
In school, when kids need to read independently by 4th grade, the  <br/>
myriad ways a child might not be reading is important for teachers  <br/>
who must get those kids reading. (No one should assume that teachers  <br/>
actually accomplish that! Special Ed takes the failures and removes  <br/>
them from the teacher&#39;s list.)<br/>
<br/>
My daughter wrote well before she could read. There might be a label  <br/>
for that in school so the teacher could channel her off to the proper  <br/>
special reading instruction. At home, it was just her approach and  <br/>
now at 17 you&#39;d never know she had that special &quot;issue&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
For unschoolers there&#39;s reading (which means comprehending) and not  <br/>
reading (which means not comprehending) and a sliding scale between  <br/>
as the child moves from not reading/comprehending towards reading/ <br/>
comprehending. (Though comprehension is more of a fuzzy concept than  <br/>
schools suggest. But if an unschooled child is picking up something  <br/>
to read, they&#39;re comprehending well enough to satisfy themselves.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Working on<br/>
&gt; comprehension and sequencing is a huge part of what I do with my<br/>
&gt; ds.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And had I done that with my non-autistic daughter before she was  <br/>
ready to read, she would have felt there was something wrong with  <br/>
her. There are several typical responses to that atmosphere. A child  <br/>
can internalize a feeling of being incompetent and needful of others  <br/>
to make them right. A child can decide they&#39;re dumb and can&#39;t do it.  <br/>
A child, with a strong sense of self preservation, can decide the  <br/>
thing they can&#39;t do is dumb so why should they try?<br/>
<br/>
By imposing help to do something a child isn&#39;t ready (or wanting) to  <br/>
do, the mom is saying through her actions that the child  is  <br/>
defective and not meeting the mom&#39;s standards. It makes no difference  <br/>
if that thought is far from the mom&#39;s mind. It&#39;s what the actions say  <br/>
to the child and words can&#39;t negate that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I use them a<br/>
&gt; lot to make picture schedules, social stories (although I don&#39;t do<br/>
&gt; them the &#39;standard&#39; way, for me it is basically taking the task and<br/>
&gt; breaking it down into the smallest possible pieces, like &quot;spit in<br/>
&gt; sink&quot; is one of the tasks for the &quot;brushing teeth&quot; story, and &quot;look<br/>
&gt; at face&quot; is a task in the &quot;how to say hi&quot; story), and visual to-do<br/>
&gt; lists.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which might be useful for some kids. But an unschooler approaches  <br/>
from a different mindset. Instead of seeing where the child is not up  <br/>
to par, an unschooler sees where her child is struggling and finds  <br/>
ways to help.<br/>
<br/>
Written out like that, it sounds subtle, but it&#39;s profound because it  <br/>
begins with &quot;I&#39;m here to help,&quot; rather than, &quot;I need to work to get  <br/>
you to point x.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have had good luck with Miquon Math (uses Cuisinairre Rods)<br/>
&gt; because it depends much more on visual than most of the other math<br/>
&gt; programs I have seen.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, there seems to be a goal of comprehension by some deadline.  <br/>
Had I looked for some particular level of competency in math as my  <br/>
daughter grew, I might be drawn to some program too.<br/>
<br/>
Math is tricky to learn. Not because it&#39;s hard -- it&#39;s actually  <br/>
pretty easy -- but because what&#39;s learned out of context often  <br/>
doesn&#39;t translate to real life, or even another program. Becoming  <br/>
competent at a program doesn&#39;t necessarily mean the child understands  <br/>
the way numbers work in real life. But programs can make the mother  <br/>
feel she&#39;s doing her job.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s true of language too. A child can sit through Spanish class,  <br/>
memorizing a few hundred words, demonstrating a competency at putting  <br/>
them in the right order, and yet not be able to answer a question  <br/>
asked in the language out in the real world.<br/>
<br/>
What I see in your approach is academic and social skills being  <br/>
pulled out of context and worked on. That&#39;s what schools do. An  <br/>
unschooling approach is to help the child do what *they&#39;re* trying to  <br/>
do in context.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-513610650">So many of the responses, thus far, show the fundamental <br/>
misunderstanding of how challenging it is to live with and try to <br/>
facilitate somebody who does not process language typically.  She <br/>
didn&#39;t speak to the issue, but often with a verbal and written <br/>
language processing difficulty, comes an inablity to understand non-<br/>
verbal/body language also.  That means they don&#39;t have the ability <br/>
to pick up anything without explicitly teaching it to them.  <br/>
Anything.  My son didn&#39;t understand what Yes and No meant until he <br/>
was 5.  He didn&#39;t have the ability to ask ANY kind of question at <br/>
all until he was 6, and so far, the only questions he is able to ask <br/>
are &quot;what is that?&quot; and his ability to ask &quot;where is that?&quot; is still <br/>
emerging.  It will likely be a few years to get to &quot;why is that?&quot; <br/>
because it is a higher level skill.  I think one of the foundations <br/>
of being able to truly unschool and have child led learning is that <br/>
they can ask questions.  Simply reading to the child and playing <br/>
puppets are so insanely pointless I don&#39;t even know where to begin. <br/>
In this case, the only thing that is doing is making the parent feel <br/>
like they are doing something, but they aren&#39;t accomplishing squat. <br/>
It is just noise to the child who can&#39;t process language.<br/>
<br/>
Look at the books at John Holt&#39;s first arguement for child led <br/>
learning and unschooling.  It is that kids learn language with us <br/>
just facilitating the process, so why do we assume that they need <br/>
anything except our facilitating for all of their other learning <br/>
too.  Well, my child did not learn language without explicit <br/>
intervention.  If I had waited, he would still be unable to <br/>
communicate (even to tell me that he is hungry) and totally unable <br/>
to navigate things that come naturally to my typically developing 2 <br/>
year old.  Your base assumption is not true for all kids.<br/>
<br/>
The use of jargon was intentional.  If you are looking for ways to <br/>
help facilitate a particularly rare learning style, it gets you to <br/>
the infomation a lot faster if you have the correct terms to <br/>
google.  Much like you used &quot;unschooling&quot; as a label for this forum, <br/>
if you are looking for support for the issue she was looking for, <br/>
the term &quot;hyperlexic&quot; is going to help, as are terms like &quot;phonetic <br/>
awareness&quot;, &quot;word attack&quot; (how somebody pronounces words, not some <br/>
violent thing), &quot;social stories&quot;, &quot;PECs&quot;, and &quot;Visual Schedules&quot;  I <br/>
will not apologize for using the technical terms because they are <br/>
there for a reason.<br/>
<br/>
The responses illustrate exactly why parents of special needs kids <br/>
can feel so frustrated and alone.  I know that I agonized trying to <br/>
do radical, pure unschooling with my autistic child.  I have <br/>
followed John Holts writings for a good 11 years before even having <br/>
children, and I was commited to it, so was the other mom I <br/>
mentioned.  It wasn&#39;t working.  Our kids didn&#39;t have the tools to be <br/>
able to learn.  He isn&#39;t able to move his body (hold a scissors, <br/>
pull up his pants, give a thumbs up sign) without somebody else <br/>
working with him, hand over hand, and gradually removing the direct <br/>
supports.  He was frustrated, but since he couldn&#39;t read body <br/>
langage, he couldn&#39;t just watch somebody else do it and infer how to <br/>
do it himself.  He couldn&#39;t just listen to somebody else speak and <br/>
infer how to do it himself.  It is just not even in the same <br/>
ballpark.  With help, he is moving towards the ability to initiate <br/>
the learning process, moving towards unschooling, but unlike <br/>
typically developing kids, he needs help to get to that point.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Curriculm&quot; isn&#39;t a bad word.  It doesn&#39;t mean we sit down and drill <br/>
for hours on end, it means they have cohesive, concrete strategies <br/>
for helping somebody learn.  It isn&#39;t a religion...you don&#39;t have to <br/>
do it &quot;just so&quot; for it to be valuable and effective.  You modify it <br/>
for your family&#39;s needs.  The OP mentioned her dd was struggling <br/>
with basic math concepts, and all of those issues go back to <br/>
comprehending what a number actually is, how numbers compare to each <br/>
other and relate to eachother.  Miquon is not a kill and drill, like <br/>
most math curriculms.  It addresses, directly, exactly what her dd <br/>
seems to be struggling with...basic number concepts.  It uses visual <br/>
supports and manipulatives that make sense to let the child discover <br/>
the concepts through play.  One of my son&#39;s favorite things to do is <br/>
play around and build with the cusinairre rods and the bucket of <br/>
shapes he has.  He has developed a spatial awareness that would <br/>
rival most adults playing around with Miquon stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
The other curriculm I mentioned addresses, very directly, <br/>
comprehension issues, and it does it in a different way than <br/>
anything else I have seen.  I don&#39;t sit down and drill with that <br/>
either, but it gave me a new, simple, strategy to help him develop <br/>
language and comprehension as we go through the day (I take the key <br/>
words and keep them on a binder ring in my pocket so that I can pull <br/>
them out and flip through them and help him organize his thoughts).  <br/>
As he progresses, there are a lot more things we can do, but, again, <br/>
just because somebody wrote it down in a book instead of a website <br/>
for unschooling does not suddenly transform it to being evil.<br/>
<br/>
I understand the frustration of the OP, even if I don&#39;t have a grasp <br/>
on the exact issues she is facing as an individual.  I understand <br/>
how difficult it is when you have tried everything you can think to <br/>
try and nothing is reaching your child. I understand what it means <br/>
to cry out for help and have people suggest things that you tried <br/>
years ago, to no avail.  I know what it feels like to be haunted by <br/>
the &quot;what if..&quot;s.  I especially know what it feels like to be <br/>
criticized for my parenting on an almost daily basis by people who <br/>
have no clue what real life is like for us...and I get it from a <br/>
spectrum of people too...I have people tell me I should spank him, <br/>
use time outs, yell at him, just &quot;let him suffer the natural <br/>
consequenses&quot; even though his sensory system won&#39;t send the message <br/>
that &quot;my toes are hurting from the cold, maybe I should put on shoes <br/>
for the snow&quot;, give him more structure, give him less structure, <br/>
give him charts and stickers and graphs, don&#39;t praise him because <br/>
then he will rely on outside confirmation...every angle, I am doing <br/>
it &quot;wrong&quot; according to just about everybody.  Well, everybody <br/>
except a few speech therapist and other moms of SN kids that also <br/>
feel isolated and like there is no place to turn and there are no <br/>
answers.  <br/>
<br/>
There is no way I can make the onlookers really understand within <br/>
the context of a post, but I do want to tell the OP, and others also <br/>
struggling, that there are ways to reach your kids, almost everybody <br/>
is capable of learning if given the right tools, it just sometimes <br/>
takes a while to find the tools that work.  You can&#39;t be so stuck on <br/>
a dogma that you close yourself off to other possibilities.  Some <br/>
kids don&#39;t fit the mold, so you break the mold and you find what <br/>
works in your situation. <br/>
<br/>
PS...I went to the &quot;Autism and Video Games&quot; link.  I agree with the <br/>
poster that support the child following his passion.  Video and <br/>
computer games have been a major part of helping my son to learn to <br/>
read, learn about life, and make connections with people.  Cutting <br/>
him off from electronics would be like cutting him off from the <br/>
air and I won&#39;t do it.  Not only does he play games with us, but <br/>
with friends and my parents (Mennonite, if that gives you an idea of <br/>
how much they understand how important this is to him).  He can beat <br/>
a lot of adults at games, and I think that is pretty cool.  <br/>
<br/>
I just think there is a place for learning how to put on clothes and <br/>
brush your teeth and get a snack for yourself.  You don&#39;t have to do <br/>
these things at a particular time, or even every day, but you should <br/>
know how to do them.  Even if he isn&#39;t able to live independently, <br/>
he will still need to know how to do these things in a group home.<br/>
<br/>
I am far, far more concerned with him keeping his happy, sweet <br/>
spirit than any skill.  It is why I pulled him out of school (which <br/>
I only did because I lost faith in myself for a while) ...he <br/>
wasn&#39;t coping at all and I wasn&#39;t going to force that on him because <br/>
it would destroy who he is.  I just know that he is happier when he <br/>
can get his needs met, and helping him learn how to communicate <br/>
those needs is far more important than any academic subject.  <br/>
<br/>
Ok...I need to just stop typing because it isn&#39;t like I am finding a <br/>
nice way to wrap this up. lol</div>

do it himself. He couldn&#39;t just listen to somebody else speak and <br/>
infer how to do it himself. It is just not even in the same <br/>
ballpark. With help, he is moving towards the ability to initiate <br/>
the learning process, moving towards unschooling, but unlike <br/>
typically developing kids, he needs help to get to that point.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Curriculm&quot; isn&#39;t a bad word. It doesn&#39;t mean we sit down and drill <br/>
for hours on end, it means they have cohesive, concrete strategies <br/>
for helping somebody learn. It isn&#39;t a religion...you don&#39;t have to <br/>
do it &quot;just so&quot; for it to be valuable and effective. You modify it <br/>
for your family&#39;s needs. The OP mentioned her dd was struggling <br/>
with basic math concepts, and all of those issues go back to <br/>
comprehending what a number actually is, how numbers compare to each <br/>
other and relate to eachother. Miquon is not a kill and drill, like <br/>
most math curriculms. It addresses, directly, exactly what her dd <br/>
seems to be struggling with...basic number concepts. It uses visual <br/>
supports and manipulatives that make sense to let the child discover <br/>
the concepts through play. One of my son&#39;s favorite things to do is <br/>
play around and build with the cusinairre rods and the bucket of <br/>
shapes he has. He has developed a spatial awareness that would <br/>
rival most adults playing around with Miquon stuff. <br/>
<br/>
The other curriculm I mentioned addresses, very directly, <br/>
comprehension issues, and it does it in a different way than <br/>
anything else I have seen. I don&#39;t sit down and drill with that <br/>
either, but it gave me a new, simple, strategy to help him develop <br/>
language and comprehension as we go through the day (I take the key <br/>
words and keep them on a binder ring in my pocket so that I can pull <br/>
them out and flip through them and help him organize his thoughts). <br/>
As he progresses, there are a lot more things we can do, but, again, <br/>
just because somebody wrote it down in a book instead of a website <br/>
for unschooling does not suddenly transform it to being evil.<br/>
<br/>
I understand the frustration of the OP, even if I don&#39;t have a grasp <br/>
on the exact issues she is facing as an individual. I understand <br/>
how difficult it is when you have tried everything you can think to <br/>
try and nothing is reaching your child. I understand what it means <br/>
to cry out for help and have people suggest things that you tried <br/>
years ago, to no avail. I know what it feels like to be haunted by <br/>
the &quot;what if..&quot;s. I especially know what it feels like to be <br/>
criticized for my parenting on an almost daily basis by people who <br/>
have no clue what real life is like for us...and I get it from a <br/>
spectrum of people too...I have people tell me I should spank him, <br/>
use time outs, yell at him, just &quot;let him suffer the natural <br/>
consequenses&quot; even though his sensory system won&#39;t send the message <br/>
that &quot;my toes are hurting from the cold, maybe I should put on shoes <br/>
for the snow&quot;, give him more structure, give him less structure, <br/>
give him charts and stickers and graphs, don&#39;t praise him because <br/>
then he will rely on outside confirmation. ..every angle, I am doing <br/>
it &quot;wrong&quot; according to just about everybody. Well, everybody <br/>
except a few speech therapist and other moms of SN kids that also <br/>
feel isolated and like there is no place to turn and there are no <br/>
answers. <br/>
<br/>
There is no way I can make the onlookers really understand within <br/>
the context of a post, but I do want to tell the OP, and others also <br/>
struggling, that there are ways to reach your kids, almost everybody <br/>
is capable of learning if given the right tools, it just sometimes <br/>
takes a while to find the tools that work. You can&#39;t be so stuck on <br/>
a dogma that you close yourself off to other possibilities. Some <br/>
kids don&#39;t fit the mold, so you break the mold and you find what <br/>
works in your situation. <br/>
<br/>
PS...I went to the &quot;Autism and Video Games&quot; link. I agree with the <br/>
poster that support the child following his passion. Video and <br/>
computer games have been a major part of helping my son to learn to <br/>
read, learn about life, and make connections with people. Cutting <br/>
him off from electronics would be like cutting him off from the <br/>
air and I won&#39;t do it. Not only does he play games with us, but <br/>
with friends and my parents (Mennonite, if that gives you an idea of <br/>
how much they understand how important this is to him). He can beat <br/>
a lot of adults at games, and I think that is pretty cool. <br/>
<br/>
I just think there is a place for learning how to put on clothes and <br/>
brush your teeth and get a snack for yourself. You don&#39;t have to do <br/>
these things at a particular time, or even every day, but you should <br/>
know how to do them. Even if he isn&#39;t able to live independently, <br/>
he will still need to know how to do these things in a group home.<br/>
<br/>
I am far, far more concerned with him keeping his happy, sweet <br/>
spirit than any skill. It is why I pulled him out of school (which <br/>
I only did because I lost faith in myself for a while) ...he <br/>
wasn&#39;t coping at all and I wasn&#39;t going to force that on him because <br/>
it would destroy who he is. I just know that he is happier when he <br/>
can get his needs met, and helping him learn how to communicate <br/>
those needs is far more important than any academic subject. <br/>
<br/>
Ok...I need to just stop typing because it isn&#39;t like I am finding a <br/>
nice way to wrap this up. lol<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-790729938">Dear Elaine<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m responding to this purely based on the information that your kid <br/>
is possibly a Chinese kid? I agree it seems that she is lacking of <br/>
certain skills. I don&#39;t know anything you can do on how to help her <br/>
become better, but would like to share a common scenario in Asia, <br/>
where I&#39;m from.<br/>
<br/>
1. Her personality is quite recognizable in Asia. In Asia, everyone <br/>
will know of someone who&#39;s known as &quot;something missing from the <br/>
head&quot; character. You may think this is rude, but bear in mind the <br/>
word &quot;retard&quot; is also the upmost degrading word anyone will call <br/>
anyone in Asia. <br/>
<br/>
2. These personalities is accepted in our community, tho not in the <br/>
highest regards, but nevertheless accepted for what they are. <br/>
Harmless and gullible. <br/>
<br/>
3. They grew up to be very much part of the community. They can be <br/>
seen working in many jobs but mostly repitative jobs like serving in <br/>
a restaurant, or mechanical workshops. In my community 1 can think <br/>
of 2- a male and my friend Rose and another child that I&#39;m <br/>
acquianted with for a short while.  <br/>
<br/>
The male is known to be very good at fixing any small electrical <br/>
stuffs, especially a table fan. Everybody likes him because he&#39;s <br/>
proved himself to be useful to the community. He can be seen walking <br/>
everywhere with bags on his back,and quite often a fan hanging onto <br/>
his back. He must now be around his 30s. <br/>
<br/>
My 18 yr old friend Rose is working for the family food business. <br/>
She can be seen serving and cleaning along with her older sister at <br/>
thier food stall. The family is very typical asian, very re-active <br/>
and combustive sort of dynamics, so lots of snapping and shouting <br/>
towards each other. So Rose can have a temper when she thinks she&#39;s <br/>
been wronged LOL! She is very chatting, and curious, asked alot fo <br/>
questions and do enjoy the male attention. <br/>
<br/>
Rose eventually married a guy who&#39;s very similar to her condition. <br/>
She&#39;s moved on, and opened her own food stall with the new hubby, <br/>
selling the same dishes that she&#39;s learned to do all her life. As <br/>
far as I can tell, they are both still very gullible and happy and <br/>
independant. She still greets me like she&#39;s just seen me yesterday, <br/>
despite the fact I&#39;ve been away for the past 5 years. <br/>
<br/>
Juliana, 15 yrs old, comes from a very rich family. She doesn&#39;t go <br/>
to school and was out of school since she was 9. I supposed the <br/>
family is unschooling of some sort. Juliane went to any lessons <br/>
Juliana wants, and when she wants. From piano to martial arts to <br/>
arts and crafts. As she&#39;s now in her teens, she&#39;s beginning to take <br/>
notice of boys, and she thinks eveyrone that speaks to her is in <br/>
love with her LOL! Now, Juliana decides she needs make-up, pretty <br/>
dresses and manicure and pedicure. And so this is what her parents <br/>
is providing her. They are very concern of the type of boyfriend <br/>
she&#39;s gonna end up with, so I must say, the matchmaking is in the <br/>
process already. But I can see it can be a tricky situation because <br/>
Juliana, as gullible and naive as she is, is very strong and <br/>
confident of her likes and dislikes. She has her favourite boybands, <br/>
and she hates certain actresses because they looked ugly. <br/>
  <br/>
4. Most of them are happy. Maybe becuase they are oblivious to alot <br/>
of our society&#39;s cruel talks and views about them. They are so <br/>
gullible that they can be so easily be pacified when annoyed. The <br/>
ones that are aggresive are the ones who gets smacked and hit and <br/>
shouted at all the time.<br/>
<br/>
5. Families in Asia do not place alot of expectations of any sort on <br/>
these children. They just accept their limitations, and go along <br/>
with it. The family just focused on teaching life skills the best <br/>
they can and protect them from all the baddies around. One of the <br/>
upmost fear is that if these kids should fall into the hands of bad <br/>
company, which is why a family responsibilities towards such <br/>
children never ends even when they are married and become parents <br/>
themselves. <br/>
<br/>
The family all do hope eventually, they will be able to find the <br/>
right marriage partner for thier child, to what I can tell, the <br/>
girls are certainly more aware of boyfriends and marriage, but I <br/>
don&#39;t know about the boys.    <br/>
<br/>
None of them thinks of professional help maybe because <br/>
1) there is no such thing existing until quite recently; and <br/>
2) they understood that this is the character of thier children, <br/>
they just accept it. It&#39;s not an illness that can be fixed. Afterall <br/>
the illness has already occured when in the tummy, which caused the <br/>
child to be like this. They just move forwards trying to make the <br/>
best of everything. So we do have cases whereby families abndoned <br/>
these children in private care homes or orphanage.  <br/>
<br/>
As for severe autism cases, I&#39;m not too sure what to think of it. I <br/>
have spoken to someone who&#39;s homeschooling an autistic child. They <br/>
are using professionals to teach their kid to verbalise things. The <br/>
method she mentioned to me sounds so cruel, but then I&#39;m not in that <br/>
position, so I cannot agree or disagree. <br/>
<br/>
I suppose the question i asked myself too. If my child is just <br/>
sitting there, not moving, not talking, not responding, just <br/>
absorded into his own world, what would I do? Would I imposed series <br/>
of activities, forcing him out of that world? Or would I just spend <br/>
more time with him, constantly connecting and talking with him, <br/>
until he&#39;s ready to come out of his shell? <br/>
<br/>
I really dont&#39; know but I do know, when my aspie kid was slightly <br/>
over a year old, we thought he was deaf and had him checked out. He <br/>
wasn&#39;t.  Thinking back now, we knew it&#39;s possibly an autistic sign <br/>
that we missed. He was a loner. But it never bothered us knowing he <br/>
was slightly different, so we just carried on interacting with him <br/>
all the time. We also realised that from his asperger&#39;s diagnostics, <br/>
that he wasn&#39;t actually verbal speaking to us until he was about <br/>
nearly 2. I guessed I must have been so intuned with my kid, maybe <br/>
it&#39;s telepathy - I&#39;ve read somewhere it&#39;s possible LOL!!! Now at age <br/>
8, he&#39;s a talkative, not stop hyper ball of opinions and views. My <br/>
child is hyperlexic. He was reading at age 4.<br/>
<br/>
We refused to conform to all the standard school expectations and <br/>
rules, so we took him out of school, and allow him to grow according <br/>
to his own natural agenda.   <br/>
<br/>
So you see, the expectations and views back home in Asia, is so much <br/>
more basic and simple. I hope this helps to lighten up your burden. <br/>
<br/>
Best Wishes,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-37821784">Hi, Jennifer--<br/>
<br/>
A child does not need to speak to lead.  A non-verbal child can lead <br/>
very effectively by having his activities and interests joined into and <br/>
mirrored.  One of the great things about children who might be labeled <br/>
as having an ASD is that their passions are often really obvious, even <br/>
if they don&#39;t speak.<br/>
<br/>
There was a show on Discovery Health the other night about a family <br/>
with six kids said to be on the spectrum.  One of the kids, who is non-<br/>
verbal, has a passion for watching doors that shut on their own.  He <br/>
was at a gym for therapy that amounted to your description of &quot;playing <br/>
puppets,&quot; when what he really wanted to do was hang out by the gym <br/>
door, open it, and watch it close on its own.  It would have been so <br/>
great if someone had hung out with him to follow his passion, instead <br/>
of leading him away from the door every time to force him to do the <br/>
equivalent of &quot;playing puppets.&quot;  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-821371457">I would like to respond to two or three posts in one post here, since it<br/>
doesn&#39;t really matter who said what...it&#39;s the ideas I&#39;d like to respond to:<br/>
<br/>
I have a 19 yo son who has many autistic traits. He has either unschooled or<br/>
chosen school (a couple of years of high school in an art school) his whole<br/>
life. He has what some would call &quot;severe&quot; issues. In fact, without my<br/>
knowledge, a psychologist at the school termed him &quot;severely disabled&quot; on<br/>
paper. I only describe him in these ways as a means of showing that he<br/>
probably compares to how other autistic-like kids were described here. He<br/>
was probably quite similar to how another young child was described in this<br/>
thread when he was that age.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Pure<br/>
&gt;&gt;unschooling for them just wasn&#39;t working for our auties.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If one is mindfully watching and learning about their child, responding to<br/>
their needs, providing the things that give them joy, pleasantly providing<br/>
information (in whatever way is most helpful to the child), creating the<br/>
environment that gives them the most peace (while sometimes adding more<br/>
elements of society as they are ready to handle them) and most of all,<br/>
living with the attitude that all is well and that their young person is<br/>
perfect as he is...what is unpure about that?<br/>
<br/>
With a focus on what our children do well and what they are passionate about<br/>
(even if it is red buttons that twirl), we can see who they are and where<br/>
they shine.<br/>
<br/>
Some kids show a need to be hand-held through things that others fly through<br/>
with ease. My son wouldn&#39;t/couldn&#39;t walk through doorways, particularly if<br/>
there were people on the other side, for many years. This presented barriers<br/>
in the world that most people don&#39;t have. So we would stand together outside<br/>
of whatever doorway was the barrier until he and I figured out how he could<br/>
get through it with the least amount of anxiety. Eventually, doorways were<br/>
not so much an issue. Though to this day he will stop outside a new doorway<br/>
and think and breathe before getting over the anxiety to go in, but he has<br/>
developed this skill, and can now go into a world of doorways on his own.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes we had to get through a doorway more quickly than he was ready<br/>
for, btw. I sometimes had to carry him through apologizing for not having<br/>
the time to go more slowly. Because most of the time we went through<br/>
doorways at his pace, he never seemed to hold it against me.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;When I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>went to read what John Holt had to say on the subject, the example<br/>
that was given of homeschooling an autistic child was not<br/>
unschooling, it was more traditional, structured homeschooling.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Haven&#39;t read John on the subject of autism, but can say that for my guy, I<br/>
did have to slow down for all kinds of things that my other three children<br/>
&quot;got&quot; quite naturally. I learned from him what helped and what didn&#39;t. His<br/>
stress level showed me what and when to stop. His joy or lack thereof showed<br/>
me which directions to go. He was usually open to my guidance in the areas<br/>
that he needed to function in life (using the bathroom properly, public<br/>
place behavior, etc.) because of the respect and admiration we gave him.<br/>
<br/>
Someone said earlier that math is easy actually. I don&#39;t think my guy has a<br/>
math chip, or at least his math chip is not like anyone else&#39;s I&#39;ve<br/>
encountered. It is interesting to watch as he tries to put this kind of<br/>
thinking together. He has some functional math-type skills...can add objects<br/>
and in his head pretty easily now. He couldn&#39;t measure in a measuring cup<br/>
until recently, and frankly, opposes the whole idea that anything SHOULD be<br/>
exact (and this kind of thinking has opened worlds to me, thank you ds).<br/>
Numbers on paper are aliens at this point. He can read, though mostly skims<br/>
as far as I can tell. He can&#39;t count money or change, though we&#39;ve done<br/>
gazillions of real life activities around it, in fun. I did try some<br/>
structured teaching around this and that was not worth the damage to our<br/>
relationship. Right now he functions on trust at the stores, pays for things<br/>
and doesn&#39;t even try to count the change. So this got us to thinking...how<br/>
many situations do people actually get the wrong change back in a<br/>
significant way (I mean by tens)? I know it happens occasionally, but not<br/>
enough for me to try to drill something in my son&#39;s head that it&#39;s not ready<br/>
for or not accepting, for whatever reason. He knows he has these pretty big<br/>
gaps, and tries to work on them himself.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, his sense of direction. He can get lost in our little<br/>
neighborhood. He wants independence. He has been taking driving lessons for<br/>
over a year, and it&#39;s not clear whether he&#39;ll be able to get his license<br/>
anytime soon. So he walks and recently starting hopping on the bus. We<br/>
continue to work on this one. He&#39;s gotten very lost in far away places on<br/>
the bus system (thank god for cell phones!!). I&#39;ve picked him up twice from<br/>
police calls when someone was concerned about a wandering man who &quot;looked<br/>
out of it&quot; called the police...that&#39;s how he looks often in public...out of<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
When police have questioned him, they quickly understand that he is a good<br/>
guy lost. That&#39;s what he was!<br/>
<br/>
So to continue to help him live in this world, we&#39;ve made maps and had<br/>
written instructions for what to do when lost, he carries ID with emergency<br/>
phone numbers, he has three family phone numbers memorized...all this just<br/>
to be able to go somewhere outside of home without a parent. At almost 20<br/>
years old. Even the trips where he ended up lost and/or with police<br/>
involvement were just part of his journey.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Now, I have found that a traditional curriculum does not work very<br/>
 </span></blockquote>well&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
There is no curriculum out there that will follow our individual children&#39;s<br/>
needs and passions. Read them for your own knowledge maybe to see if you get<br/>
some tips or ideas, but using a whole curriculum for anyone is just a<br/>
daunting thing to even think about.<br/>
<br/>
Pure unschooling to me means all of the things above. However I can equip<br/>
myself (reading websites, curriculums, talking to &quot;professionals&quot;) is great<br/>
for me. But as soon as I take my eye off my child and what they are telling<br/>
me, I will get confused and pulled in an &quot;off&quot; direction. THAT has rung loud<br/>
and clear my son&#39;s whole lovely life.<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/blogs">http://sandradodd.com/blogs</a><br/>
<br/>
but there&#39;s a link up to there now to this:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
On the left there are blogs, and I&#39;ll add more, but most of those  <br/>
also have a similar list of blogs, so one can just hop around and  <br/>
read what seems good and see photos of the daily doings of  <br/>
unschoolers.  It&#39;s a WONDERFUL thing, and makes pages like this seem  <br/>
quaint and dusty:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/typical">http://sandradodd.com/typical</a><br/>
<br/>
but I&#39;m willing to be a curator of some things that will become more  <br/>
and more quaint, because it&#39;s also good to know that just a few years  <br/>
ago, unschooling information wasn&#39;t so easy to share or find.  And in  <br/>
the unschooling lifetime of many people on this list, there was no  <br/>
such thing as a list.  MANY of us started unschooling when we needed  <br/>
to depend on Growing Without Schooling to come every other month.<br/>

There&#39;s something Jacki wrote when her daughter made a beautiful,  <br/>
artistic meal (right, and border).<br/>
<br/>
And from this thread I&#39;ve saved this part:<br/>

I know people could find it in the archives, but moving it lets the  <br/>
anti-unschooling comments be anonymous.<br/>
<br/>
I might add other comments there later.<br/>

I&#39;ve been (again) in urgent care for hours with Marty.  I&#39;m tired,  <br/>
but not as tired as poor Marty is.  I have less faith in doctors now  <br/>
that I had last week, and that already wasn&#39;t very much.<br/>
