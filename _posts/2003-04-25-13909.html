<div id="ygrps-yiv-692668726">Good morning friends.<br/>
<br/>
Last nite I tried to log on the that site I sent here about the online <br/>
bashing kids are doing and to my shock a local talk radio station made such a <br/>
stink about it the site was closed down!!! I am completely for freedom of <br/>
speech but apparently there were occasions in which violence was being <br/>
threatened on this site and sought out in life.<br/>
<br/>
Just thought you&#39;d all like to know. The site was &lt;A HREF=&quot;www.schoolscandals.com&quot;&gt;www.schoolscandals.com&lt;/A&gt;. <br/>
Poor little bully&#39;s, I wonder if they feel bullied themselves, since someone <br/>
bigger shut them up?<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Rhonda<br/>
