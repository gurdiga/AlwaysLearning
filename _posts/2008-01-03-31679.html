<div id="ygrps-yiv-1618860567">Many of you know about the Campbell&#39;s Soups &quot;Labels for Education&quot;<br/>
program.<br/>
We just discovered that individual homeschool families are eligible<br/>
for the<br/>
program as well. The letter below was the response we got when asking what<br/>
to provide. Very easy! At the bottom of the letter is the contact<br/>
information from the coordinator, Anne Pizarro.<br/>
<br/>
FYI - there is also a &quot;Labels for America&quot; program. With this, if your<br/>
child does any kind of volunteer work/project you can get up to 2,000<br/>
points<br/>
a year.<br/>
<br/>
You can go to their website www.labelsforeducat ion.com then &quot;Coordinators<br/>
and Schools&quot; (on the left), then &quot;Manage the Program&quot;, then &quot;Advice from<br/>
Anne&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
This is a great program where you can get all kinds of stuff from art<br/>
supplies to electronics.<br/>
<br/>
Happy collecting!<br/>

PS: Box Tops for Education (from General Mills) also allows homeschool<br/>
groups to participate, but there has to be 15+ children. It&#39;s worth<br/>
getting<br/>
your homeschool group involved. www.boxtopsforeduca tion.com<br/>

Dear Barry,<br/>
<br/>
I am writing regarding the Campbell&#39;s Labels for Education Program.<br/>
Accreditation from your state would be a certificate or a letter<br/>
recognizing<br/>
your home school as an educational institute. Some states do not require<br/>
accreditation. Please send a letter of request along an invoice<br/>
showing any<br/>
educational merchandise that you have ordered for your home school. Please<br/>
send your letter of request to:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
