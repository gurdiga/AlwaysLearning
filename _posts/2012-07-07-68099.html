<div id="ygrps-yiv-263908725">This might get long. I don&#39;t know how much info to provide or leave out.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My sister and I always talked about homeschooling, even before we had kids.<br/>
We live in the same state about an hour apart and planned to encourage each<br/>
other and do stuff together. Years passed and she had several kids close<br/>
together. I think her life became overwhelming so she just sent the oldest<br/>
off to school when it was time for Kindergarten. She had 4 kids then and<br/>
couldn&#39;t see how she could homeschool one while meeting the needs of the<br/>
other 3 and managing the household. I guess getting 1 out of the house made<br/>
things easier. Then with one off to school, might as well send the next one,<br/>
and the next one. Now she has 5 kids, 4 are in school (ages 6, 9, 10, 12)<br/>
and a 2yo at home.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The middle child who just turned 9 is not doing well in school. She probably<br/>
has dyslexia (my sister had it and we think my dad did as well) and although<br/>
she has not been officially tested for dyslexia, she attends special classes<br/>
every day. She had delayed speech and issues with sounds and has been in<br/>
speech therapy for years. This makes her miss whatever is going on in her<br/>
regular class, so she is behind in all subjects. For some reason the<br/>
teachers do not make her do the work the other kids are doing. They cross<br/>
off the math problems she doesn&#39;t have to do so she only does the easy ones<br/>
(like 8+1, she doesn&#39;t have to do 32+23 that the other kids do). They allow<br/>
her to copy the spelling word list while other kids are taking a test. They<br/>
give her coloring pages instead of reading. This is 3rd grade, btw. I can<br/>
only imagine what her self esteem is like. She has to know she is different<br/>
and being treated differently.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My sister told me she is thinking of keeping her out of school next year and<br/>
I said YES, DO IT! She wants to but she is scared. She does not get along<br/>
with her 9yo and thinks having her at home will be a nightmare. She has a<br/>
2yo too. They seem to have nothing in common and my sister doesn&#39;t know what<br/>
to do or how to help her. She is still stuck on the notion that kids &quot;need<br/>
to know certain things&quot; and thinking she won&#39;t be able to teach her<br/>
anything. She knows what it&#39;s like to have dyslexia, having been through it,<br/>
but when my sister was diagnosed at age 10, she dove into the program head<br/>
first. She did well memorizing flash cards and listening to phonics<br/>
records/tapes and completing the workbooks. She worked really hard all the<br/>
way through high school and even college. But this is part of who she is,<br/>
strong willed and disciplined, and why it made sense for her to join the<br/>
Marine Corps at 18. She was all set to go to Iraq (I was going to help her<br/>
husband out with the older 2 while she was gone) but she got pregnant with<br/>
this child, her 3rd, and didn&#39;t go. (Hmm. wonder if there is a bit of<br/>
resentment there? She loved being a Marine and trained all those years to go<br/>
to war and never went.)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, her daughter is NOT like her at all. She is messy; my sister is<br/>
NEAT, everything must be organized and in its place. She is creative, always<br/>
drawing (happens to be left handed); my sister cannot draw and doesn&#39;t see<br/>
herself as creative. My sister says she is sassy and defiant, has a temper<br/>
and throws fits, doesn&#39;t listen and won&#39;t do things she is asked to do. They<br/>
are at odds and my sister had 4 other kids who also need her. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have 1 child who just turned 8. My sister knows he&#39;s never been to school<br/>
but doesn&#39;t know we&#39;re unschooling (and we&#39;re on the radical side,<br/>
unschooling life and parenting in a very different way than she is). She has<br/>
been asking me questions about how we do things and what our days are like.<br/>
She wants recommendations for curriculum and I have no experience there. She<br/>
wants to make sure she &quot;stays at grade level&quot; or rather catches up to where<br/>
she is &quot;supposed to be&quot; since she&#39;s not there now. I don&#39;t want to scare her<br/>
away from homeschooling, but we are about as unstructured as it gets. I<br/>
don&#39;t believe there is a place where all kids should be, I don&#39;t believe<br/>
tests are helpful, I don&#39;t believe grades are relevant. We don&#39;t have much<br/>
of a schedule; we eat when we&#39;re hungry and sleep when we&#39;re tired. We might<br/>
stay at home and play wii in our pajamas or drive across town to visit fun<br/>
places. My son takes classes he wants to when he is interested in something.<br/>
We fly by the seat of our pants a lot more than she would be comfortable<br/>
with. Since it is summer and her kids are out of school, it&#39;s easier to get<br/>
together with them. Recently we took the kids swimming and last night went<br/>
to a rodeo together so I&#39;m seeing her kids more than usual. I feel a<br/>
connection with her daughter because she is a lot like me (left-handed,<br/>
creative, defiant, low self esteem because of a mother who doesn&#39;t like her<br/>
- my sister did NOT have this issue, she was the clear favorite and had a<br/>
VERY different relationship with our mother!).<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I just found out my sister&#39;s biggest fear is what if she pulls her out of<br/>
school and tries homeschooling for one year but can&#39;t take it and puts her<br/>
back and she&#39;s not any further along than where she is right now. She was<br/>
tested a few months ago and scored the equivalent of first grade, first<br/>
month (1.1) in math and reading and this was towards the end of 3rd grade.<br/>
She is NOT ready for 4th grade, but the school would just shuffle her along.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I could help her, but I&#39;m not sure what to suggest or say or do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-528856631">I thought of returning the post because it&#39;s not really about unschooling, and I don&#39;t think discussing the problems of school is good for the Always Learning discussion.   There are a few points I wanted to make, and others might be willing to help a bit, but as to a full analysis of your sister&#39;s problem, it&#39;s not about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My sister and I always talked about homeschooling, even before we had kids.<br/>
We live in the same state about an hour apart and planned to encourage each<br/>
other and do stuff together.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If a person wants to know more, that&#39;s one thing.  If they&#39;re embroiled in and invested in school and they don&#39;t want to know about unschooling, it&#39;s probably best not to bring it up to them.<br/>
<br/>
However, if your sister knew how you homeschooled, it might be helpful to her.  If she&#39;s asking about a curriculum, it might be good to tell her you don&#39;t use one.<br/>
<br/>
-=-The middle child who just turned 9 is not doing well in school. She probably<br/>
has dyslexia (my sister had it and we think my dad did as well) and although<br/>
she has not been officially tested for dyslexia, she attends special classes<br/>
every day. She had delayed speech and issues with sounds and has been in<br/>
speech therapy for years. This makes her miss whatever is going on in her<br/>
regular class, so she is behind in all subjects.-=-<br/>
<br/>
That last part isn&#39;t dyslexia.  <br/>
Maybe something here would help you think about ways to help your sister, though:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/special/">http://sandradodd.com/special/</a><br/>
<br/>
-=-For some reason the<br/>
teachers do not make her do the work the other kids are doing. -=-<br/>
<br/>
You seem to think it would help someone for teachers to attempt to &quot;make&quot; your niece do &quot;the work&quot; other kids are doing.<br/>
<br/>
-=-. They allow her to copy the spelling word list while other kids are taking a test. They<br/>
give her coloring pages instead of reading. This is 3rd grade, btw. I can only imagine what her self esteem is like. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Probably not as bad as if she was trying and failing to do what the others are doing, all day, every school day.<br/>
<br/>
-=-. She does not get along with her 9yo and thinks having her at home will be a nightmare.-=-<br/>
<br/>
School does drive a wedge between parents and children.  Parental attachment to school and &quot;progress&quot; and &quot;keeping up&quot; cement that wedge into place.<br/>
<br/>
-=-She is still stuck on the notion that kids &quot;need<br/>
to know certain things&quot; and thinking she won&#39;t be able to teach her<br/>
anything.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If she thinks you&#39;re teaching your children certain things, instead of providing a comfortable, interesting, safe environment, you&#39;re contributing to that, somewhat.<br/>
<br/>
-=-. She is creative, always drawing (happens to be left handed)-=-<br/>
<br/>
Dyslexia isn&#39;t a disease.  And it often comes with left-handedness. <br/>
<br/>
-=-My sister says she is sassy and defiant, has a temper<br/>
and throws fits, doesn&#39;t listen and won&#39;t do things she is asked to do. They<br/>
are at odds and my sister had 4 other kids who also need her. <br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could suggest that your sister put that child out for adoption.<br/>
Ultimately, your sister can either find the good things in her child, or continue to resent her more.<br/>
Your sister won&#39;t want to do that, but thinking about it for a moment might help her choose to keep her daughter  home and be nice to her.<br/>
<br/>
A child doesn&#39;t have to go to school &quot;to know she is different and being treated differently.&quot;  Parents can do that damage at home, and then a child has no safe place to go at the end of the &quot;school day.&quot;   But at home, children SHOULD be treated differently, each one in his own special way.<br/>
<br/>
-=-She wants recommendations for curriculum and I have no experience there. She<br/>
wants to make sure she &quot;stays at grade level&quot; or rather catches up to where<br/>
she is &quot;supposed to be&quot; since she&#39;s not there now. -=-<br/>
<br/>
If a school full of trained special ed teachers can&#39;t get her daughter &quot;at grade level,&quot; why should your sister think she can?  <br/>
Poor child.  Poor family!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s very likely that by the time she&#39;s 15, no one will know your niece was ever &quot;behind,&quot; IF your sister can relax and give her more time and space to learn in her own ways and in her own time.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe a year vacation would be helpful.  Maybe sending her to a different school from her siblings could help (if your sister&#39;s family can afford that).  If she does want to keep her home, maybe a few appointments by phone or skype with Michelle Barone could help her settle on ways to help her daughter and to improve their relationship.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.michellebarone.net/">http://www.michellebarone.net/</a><br/>
<br/>
If she wants to know about some typical days, maybe send this:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/typical">http://sandradodd.com/typical</a><br/>
<br/>
There are ideas for a way to look at unschooling in school terms, too, here:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum">http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum</a><br/>
<br/>
For the sake of your own child and your own family, though, don&#39;t attach to this situation or its outcome.  Offer ideas and back away.  That will sound harsh, but if you look too closely and invest too much emotion in a situation you can&#39;t control, it can do damage to your own peace.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1404865265">Thank you for taking the time to respond. I know it wasn&#39;t about<br/>
unschooling, I just didn&#39;t know where else to bring my question. I want to<br/>
help but feel like I can&#39;t. I would love to have my sister join me on my<br/>
unschooling journey. I would love for her to take this one child out of<br/>
school and then realize she could take the others out too. The other 3 are<br/>
boys and are all reading beyond &quot;grade level&quot; and being held back by school.<br/>
They can only go so far, one in particular is obviously bored. But she is<br/>
not concerned so much with them because they get good grades. But she is so<br/>
far from where I am and I don&#39;t even know if I can meet her halfway. I feel<br/>
like I should have been helping her all along, but we haven&#39;t been that<br/>
close. We are working on bettering our friendship.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have been worried that this might be someone&#39;s advice:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;For the sake of your own child and your own family, though, don&#39;t attach<br/>
to this situation or its outcome. Offer ideas and back away. That will sound<br/>
harsh, but if you look too closely and invest too much emotion in a<br/>
situation you can&#39;t control, it can do damage to your own peace.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I just hope I can offer the right advice. That&#39;s why I came to this group.<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s too OT because it&#39;s not entirely about unschooling. I wish it<br/>
were. If anyone has helped a friend or relative find the path to<br/>
unschooling, I&#39;d love to hear more about that.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;School does drive a wedge between parents and children. Parental<br/>
attachment to school and &quot;progress&quot; and &quot;keeping up&quot; cement that wedge into<br/>
place.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am just beside myself and weeping for this child. I don&#39;t know how to help<br/>
her. I feel like I can&#39;t just stand by while my sister flails and treats her<br/>
poorly. Or I&#39;d be just as bad as all the adults in my life who looked the<br/>
other way and didn&#39;t help ME when I was a kid. When she talks frankly about<br/>
her daughter, I hear my own mother complaining to one of her sisters about<br/>
me. I wonder if she did. My whole life I felt my mother didn&#39;t like me,<br/>
still feel it. She never understood me, she never defended me, she never<br/>
listened to me. We don&#39;t have a relationship now. At all. I remember<br/>
wondering why my aunts didn&#39;t take my mother aside and tell her there was a<br/>
better way, how to have a better relationship with me. Maybe they didn&#39;t<br/>
know a better way. One aunt has always had great relationships with her 3<br/>
kids and I wanted her to tell my mom the secret. I think is has to do with<br/>
being brave enough to not do what your mom did to you if it was awful.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;However, if your sister knew how you homeschooled, it might be helpful to<br/>
her. If she&#39;s asking about a curriculum, it might be good to tell her you<br/>
don&#39;t use one.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If she thinks you&#39;re teaching your children certain things, instead of<br/>
providing a comfortable, interesting, safe environment, you&#39;re contributing<br/>
to that, somewhat.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I thought she knew we didn&#39;t use a set curriculum, but I told her point<br/>
blank yesterday. I illustrated examples of what our typical days might be<br/>
like. I tried really hard to explain our lifestyle. No bedtime, no limits on<br/>
screen time, no forced workbooks or reading time (although he does often sit<br/>
and read and I read to him most nights in bed), learning all the time and<br/>
connecting subjects and going off on tangents, how I play video games with<br/>
my son, how he doesn&#39;t have chores but when I need help I ask and he&#39;ll<br/>
often do what he can and occasionally not help in which case I just do it<br/>
myself, how some days we stay in pajamas and other days we&#39;re all over town,<br/>
he takes classes and does sports of his choosing, AND I even said several<br/>
times that I don&#39;t care what kids his age are learning in school. Who<br/>
decided what kids should learn and when? Why is it different in different<br/>
states? We moved around a lot as our dad was a Marine and I told her how<br/>
when we moved to NC my 8th grade year I felt like I was repeating 7th grade.<br/>
Some of the math I had done in 6th grade in Hawaii. I even had to read the<br/>
same books over. It was like torture. That was the year she repeated 4th<br/>
grade, after being told she had dyslexia and spending a year doing special<br/>
work, but no one at the new school knew.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s worried about too much TV and video games. I told her how much certain<br/>
games have helped my son learn to read (and gave him the desire to read) and<br/>
problem solve and so on. She said she gets that kids are learning all the<br/>
time, but there is a point when kids have been in front of the tv too long.<br/>
I admitted that some days all he wants to do is master a level and I might<br/>
sit and watch, play with him, cheer him on, clean the kitchen, take a<br/>
shower, bring him food, answer emails, talk on the phone, or any number of<br/>
things. And when he was done he&#39;d stop and do something else. I do know this<br/>
is a hard concept for a lot of people to grasp, so I wasn&#39;t pushing it too<br/>
hard, just put it out there.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Maybe you could suggest that your sister put that child out for<br/>
adoption.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I wish I could bring her to my house and raise her but that can&#39;t be the<br/>
answer! I want to help and feel like I don&#39;t have much time to save her. If<br/>
I can&#39;t explain unschooling by the end of August, or at least get my sister<br/>
some resources so she can try a relaxed version of home schooling, I fear<br/>
she just might enroll her back in school. I feel like I have 2 months to<br/>
show her how awesome life can be and especially how relationships matter so<br/>
much more than school subjects and timelines.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The links were very helpful. I&#39;ll send her some tonight and maybe more after<br/>
a bit. Don&#39;t want to bombard her with it, but hope maybe she&#39;ll read a few<br/>
at a time.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for taking the time to respond even though it&#39;s not really an<br/>
unschooling issue.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1585406620">Step away from all the school stuff. Do you like your niece? I don&#39;t mean &quot;do you love her&quot; I mean do you want to spend time with her? If so, offer to do that - not homeschool stuff, except maybe &quot;art&quot; instead offer to do fun things with her, get her out of mom&#39;s hair and be her friend. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I don&#39;t want to scare her<br/>
&gt; away from homeschooling, but we are about as unstructured as it gets.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You could tell her that - there are other ways to homeschool, and she&#39;ll probably pick something very different than what you do. That means you&#39;re not a useful homeschooling resource to her, but you can be a different kind of resource for her daughter. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My sister and I always talked about homeschooling, even before we had kids.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lots of people talk about homeschooling and never do it - most of the moms I knew when Mo was a baby were talking about homeschooling right up to the point when they put their kids in school. Of people who do homeschool, most take at least a year to figure out what &quot;works&quot; for them. A girlfriend of mine is all excited about unschooling at the moment - she&#39;s had a kid in the hospital, but once all that settles down there&#39;s no way of knowing if she&#39;ll unschool or homeschool or put her kids back in school, so I&#39;m working hard on having no expectations in that regard. There&#39;s really no way of knowing what she&#39;ll decide until the school year begins. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>If her relationship with her kids isn&#39;t like yours, she could well come to the conclusion that she could never do that, because her kid isn&#39;t like that. In a way, she&#39;d be right - if (if!!!) she were to unschool it would likely look very different than your life because her daughter is not your son (and she has a bunch of other kids besides). That&#39;s why &quot;this is what works for me&quot; advice isn&#39;t so good for helping people understand unschooling - personalities matter, and history matters. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I feel like I have 2 months to<br/>

&gt; much more than school subjects and timelines.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You can do that with your niece in school by becoming her friend. If you live close enough, pick her up from school some days and take her to do something fun for an hour. If you live a little farther, have her over on the weekend for a &quot;girls day out&quot;. If you live farther, invite her to spend the rest of the summer with you. Make it a gift you&#39;re giving to both your sister and your niece, a break, a chance for your sister to feel like her daughter has Some adult who can connect and guide her, a chance for your niece to feel supported. <br/>
<br/>
If your sister and her daughter don&#39;t get along, there may not be a good short-term fix for that. School, with it&#39;s attempts to make things easier on this girl may well be the better option than her being home with a critical mom who&#39;s going to push-push-push her.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If anyone has helped a friend or relative find the path to<br/>
&gt; unschooling<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t attach so much to unschooling. It&#39;s not a panacea. I&#39;ve met a few families for which unschooling was a disaster and the kids were miserable - it takes some skills and resources which not all families have! Don&#39;t blame your sister or yourself if unschooling isn&#39;t a good option for her family. Instead, look for ways to help improve the situation at hand - what can you do right now to ease the stress a bit? Maybe instead of taking the girl out, you can invite all the boys over for a day of boy fun and let mom and daughter have a spa day.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;My whole life I felt my mother didn&#39;t like me,<br/>
&gt; still feel it. She never understood me, she never defended me, she never<br/>
&gt; listened to me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It won&#39;t help anyone to make your sister&#39;s relationship with her daughter about you. Not you, not the sister, not the niece. Maybe you can use a tiny little bit of that to commiserate with your niece and be her friend, but don&#39;t go overboard or you&#39;ll drive the wedge between mother and daughter deeper. If you decide to become her friend, part of your job is to Support the mother-child relationship. So work on keeping your own baggage separate. That&#39;s important.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;One aunt has always had great relationships with her 3<br/>
&gt; kids and I wanted her to tell my mom the secret.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Part of the secret is to be someone else, have a different history and a different personality. Part of the secret is to have the right resources - but which resources are &quot;right&quot; is going to vary. It&#39;s much easier to have all the right resources with a kid whose personality is like yours than with a kid who doesn&#39;t like what you like or think the way you think or have needs which make sense to you.  When one child is the &quot;odd man out&quot; in a family, it throws a big, big monkey wrench into the works (mixing my metaphors!). Having an &quot;odd man out&quot; can feel like parents being asked to give up what they want and love for their child - and to an extent that&#39;s true, at least at first. <br/>
<br/>
If you can help your sister and niece, then do that. Don&#39;t frame it in terms of unschooling or teaching your sister to be a better parent, do it as a gift. But don&#39;t beat yourself up if you don&#39;t have the resources to help them - it won&#39;t help anyone to feel crummy about things you can&#39;t change. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1060294834">Will she read a book? Get a copy of &quot;The Parent-Teen Breakthrough: A<br/>
Relationship Approach&quot; by Myra Kirschenbaum and give it to her.<br/>
<br/>
I also have a sister who doesn&#39;t take kindly to being given advice by me -<br/>
but she will read and was open to the ideas in that book. It isn&#39;t about<br/>
unschooling - it is about putting the parent/teen relationship as one&#39;s<br/>
highest priority.<br/>

If your sister chose to homeschool her daughter by *any* method you guys all might be able to hang out more together and over time your sister could just witness more of your life. You might do some fun stuff together. You could also develop a closer relationship with your niece if you saw her without the rest of her family and this is more likely whatever homeschool method your sister chose. If homeschooling went quite well for the first year your sister might then be more relaxed carrying on into the future and less concerned about where your niece would score in terms of grades etc. So maybe try and support your sister into any homeschooling at first. <br/>
However, you don&#39;t want to put such a good spin on it that you get blamed if it all goes wrong. It has to be your sister&#39;s sure decision.<br/>
