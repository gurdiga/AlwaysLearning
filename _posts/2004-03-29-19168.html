<div id="ygrps-yiv-1308097575">Hello all -<br/>
I&#39;ve read NVC (Non-Violent Communication) and have gotten some of the other <br/>
materials through the website, too....<br/>
<br/>
I have, too, found it very helpful with connection.  I believe that <br/>
tears/upset about one thing really tie in to deep bodily pain.  So crying about the <br/>
last cookie falling out the window is possibly really a trigger/access for deeper <br/>
 pain/experiences.  (Have you had the experience of offering another cookie <br/>
but it doesn&#39;t help?!)  <br/>
<br/>
So, through reading NVC and other materials, I&#39;ve tried to develop the <br/>
practice of simply being with &#39;what is&#39; without fixing it right off.  Sometimes just <br/>
identifying the feeling frees it and opens one to healing.  It is a powerful <br/>
moment to be with someone who speaks the feeling of pain (fear, sadness, etc) <br/>
and feels somehow &#39;lighter&#39; by having named the underlying feeling.   There&#39;s <br/>
a connection that can happen - with compassion and understanding, too.....<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reminding me about the NVC stuff.  I have the little wallet size <br/>
cards of feelings to help me identify them with myself and others.  I&#39;ll keep <br/>
them handy today.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I need to go fix a frozen computer so Magic School Bus Rainforest can be <br/>
freed!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
