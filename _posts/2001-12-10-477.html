&lt;&lt; you&#39;re SO right-voiced (right talking? right<br/>
wing? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
OH yeah.  Conservative me.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just multi-talking-taskative.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;sometimes I forget that people take <br/>
responses to their posts as if they are written directly TO them, personally. <br/>
All comments I ever make are really to the &quot;idea&quot; - not necessarily to an <br/>
individual poster. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Me too.<br/>
<br/>
When people ask &quot;are you saying I&#39;m not an unschooler?&quot; to use an example <br/>
which didn&#39;t happen on this list my choices are to ignore it or say &quot;yes&quot; or <br/>
to say &quot;no&quot; and none of them conveys any useful information.  What I&#39;m saying <br/>
is that some piece of evidence I quoted from some post (often one I didn&#39;t <br/>
even note the author of) seemed iffy to me, or problematical, or illustrative <br/>
of something the parent could look at more closely or from a different angle <br/>
if they want unschooling to work optimally.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m lightly flabbergasted (what is &quot;lightly flabbergasted&quot;?  &quot;kind <br/>
surprised&quot; I guess) when someone on a mailing list for unschoolers isn&#39;t <br/>
interested in how unschooling can work optimally.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m not trying to pick on individuals at all.  I&#39;m hoping people will <br/>
throw out ideas to be tumbled around and decorated and wiped off and tossed <br/>
back and forth and we&#39;ll all know more at the end.  <br/>
