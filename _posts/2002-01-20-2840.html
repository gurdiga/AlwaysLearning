I don&#39;t think you did.<br/>
<br/>
My first recommendation was going to be to invite her to go with your family, <br/>
even if she had to take off some school to do it.  It could be that part of <br/>
the jealousy has to do with your kids not having to be in school and her <br/>
having to work around school.   So rather than looking at the focal point <br/>
(the grandmother), turn and look at the other factors, maybe.  It might not <br/>
be so much about grandmother time at all.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s both.  My mother is a wonderful grandmom.  She always <br/>
reminded me of Mary Poppins growing up.  She was a little magical, <br/>
and the kids seem to have the same feelings. Actually lots of people <br/>
gravitate towards her.  <br/>
Anyway, I just reread my post and MAN was that long!  Sorry..I can <br/>
ramble at times.<br/>
Thanks for the reply.<br/>
We actually wanted their whole family to come too.  My SIL, niece and <br/>
nephew.  But that wasn&#39;t the plan for them.  It all worked out in the <br/>
end.  My dd decide to go with my niece (fly) and they will come back <br/>
the day before Easter.  And we&#39;re going in Feb.<br/>
I&#39;m glad I was sensative to her feelings.  I just vented here.<br/>
Again, sorry for the massive post!<br/>
