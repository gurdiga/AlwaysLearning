We could talk more about what it really IS that they need -- I have some <br/>
pretty strong opinions on that, based on 27 years of teaching at at least six <br/>
different colleges, ranging from large public universities to selective <br/>
private colleges to community colleges. (HINT - it isn&#39;t chemistry &lt;BEG&gt;)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &lt;&lt;Success in college or having any job requires the ability to schedule your <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; time and being able to show up to do work even when you don&#39;t feel like it.&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My unschooled 17 yo goes to work four days a week. On Monday, Wednesday and <br/>
Friday, she gets herself up at about 6:30 am and gets ready, makes a lunch, <br/>
and is out the door by 7:30 for her 8 am job. On Saturday she works 10 to 2. <br/>
On Tuesdays and Thursdays she takes community college courses from 11 am to <br/>
10 pm (with some breaks, in between, of course). I don&#39;t tell her when to get <br/>
up (or go to bed) and I don&#39;t keep up with her laundry for her and I don&#39;t <br/>
know what schoolwork she has or when she has exams, etc. She&#39;s fully <br/>
responsible. She has a 3.8-something grade point average and over 60 semester <br/>
units. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m telling you this because you seem to assume that this will be harder for <br/>
an unschooled kid than for a schooled kid who has had to be on someone else&#39;s <br/>
schedule most of their lives. It isn&#39;t ANY harder (or easier &lt;g&gt;). <br/>

&gt; years, but wished they had had more structure / guidance during the <br/>
&gt; highschool years.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My kids have wanted that as they got older and have gotten it largely in the <br/>
form of taking community college courses. Roxana is here on this list - she <br/>
started community college courses this semester, at 14. I think it is that, <br/>
for some kids, their interests get to the point that they&#39;d prefer to study <br/>
something in a systematic way with help from someone with expertise - taking <br/>
a course is a way to do that (not the only way).<br/>

will always delve into a new topic that she is interested in and will &#39;play with it&#39; until she is done.  <br/>
The other doesn&#39;t seem to have interests that draw her in.  She needs more guidance and <br/>
encouragement to broaden her horizons and interests. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1951432194">Throwing wrenches.<br/>
Thanks for all the great replies.   You may be right about the music.  I do<br/>
think some people are born to play and others need more encouragement to do<br/>
well. With practice, most people can do better at anything, but when we<br/>
discover our gifts(my dd&#39;s writing and art) our passion is awakened and<br/>
encouragement is less of an issue. The unschooling idea is new to me.  Maybe<br/>
my future grandchildren.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;The wide boulevards of opportunity&#39;--very nice.  &#39;Many doors opened&#39; has<br/>
been my common perception, but even that visual seems limiting in<br/>
comparison.<br/>
Perhaps my dd&#39;s dreams don&#39;t require a college degree, but the document<br/>
usually raises earning potential.  The lack of one has seemed an obstacle to<br/>
me, even with lots of credits.<br/>
<br/>
Your stories inspire.  Unschooling cultivates that natural curiosity and<br/>
commitment many ps kids have squashed, must struggle to maintain or discover<br/>
again afterward. Unschooling does prepare kids for college or whatever they<br/>
want to do.  The actual learning ability is what colleges and employers are<br/>
looking for anyway.<br/>
<br/>
My point that some kids may need specific skill building to do well in their<br/>
chosen fields was kind of lost.  Opening a discussion with my wrench was the<br/>
hope though&lt;g&gt;.   Keep those stories of the older kids&#39; experiences coming.<br/>
They encourage the rest of us and lay to rest our uncertainties.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Depends on what field you&#39;re looking in. Had I not dropped out of college <br/>
(2nd semester junior by credit hours---I went 3 straight years with summer <br/>
school every year, but kept transferring, so I kept losing hours), I think I <br/>
would have felt pidgeon-holed and that I&#39;d HAVE to stay within that &quot;major&quot; <br/>
field. By getting out, I&#39;ve had the world opened (not that it REALLY wasn&#39;t <br/>
already!&lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
As a groomer, I was actually netting more a lot than my vet friends because <br/>
of my low overhead. And I had fewer headaches---and at least MY clients <br/>
didn&#39;t die and they looked better when they left! Plus, my friends were still <br/>
paying off student loans.<br/>
<br/>
Learning potential is more important than earning potential!<br/>
