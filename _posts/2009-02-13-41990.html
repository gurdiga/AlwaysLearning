<div id="ygrps-yiv-279301442">have been thinking about something my mil said to me today about life in general and i think <br/>
it definitely applies to unschooling.  she said, &quot;you have a choice to either live your life full of <br/>
fear or full of love.&quot;  i thought it was quite profound and can pretty much sum up many of the <br/>
choices we make as parents and wanted to share it with you all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1080148522">I agree with you that this is a wonderful insight.  I&#39;ve made many decisions with this exact <br/>
thought in mind.  How nice that your MIL is coming from this perspective!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks for sharing. I read that and thought, &quot;I know That!&quot; But, it&#39;s <br/>
something that I have not recognized. So, it&#39;s appreciated. *saving it <br/>
for future reference* :D</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2022334472">After having a long bought with cancer, I started having extreme <br/>
anxiety (fear) whenever I would have to leave my house to go <br/>
somewhere.  I asked myself what the opposite of FEAR is.  I decided it <br/>
was LOVE. Now, when I&#39;m afraid and about to panic, I tell myself, I <br/>
would love to go here or I would love to go there, etc.  It helps to <br/>
get in a mind set of love.  It really does help to cancel out the fear.</div>
