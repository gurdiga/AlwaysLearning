<div id="ygrps-yiv-1989845029">I bragged up Joyce; I should brag up Pam.   Today&#39;s a good day,  <br/>
because it&#39;s Pam&#39;s birthday!<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes people ask me why I have been able to go so many years of  <br/>
helping people and writing on lists.  It&#39;s largely because Pam  <br/>
appreciates and encourages me!<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a beautiful photo of Pam and all her family here:<br/>

<br/>
I didn&#39;t take it and I don&#39;t know who did, but I swiped it from Roya&#39;s  <br/>
photos, somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Pam, thank you for all your thoughtful help over the years.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1275393365">Shall we collect some gratitude for Pam statements?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so eternally grateful to Pam because hers was the first writing about <br/>
unschooling, other than John Holt, so the first real in-the-trenches with <br/>
real kids writing, that I read. She was leaving a statewide e-list and I <br/>
asked her where she could be found online. She directed me to the then <br/>
iteration of Unschooling Discussion and the rest is history. And Jayn was <br/>
something like 1.5 years old.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m grateful to Pam for the energy that she has put into Dragontree over the <br/>
years. I don&#39;t get down there often, but it&#39;s so good to know it&#39;s there.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m grateful to Pam because, even though it&#39;s not a support list, she shares <br/>
stories of her daughters, who have grown up to be magnificent women, that <br/>
over and over give me hope and encouragement.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m grateful to Pam because for some reason of her own, that I can&#39;t fathom, <br/>
she always seems glad to see me. I&#39;m always very glad to see her.<br/>
<br/>
Happy birthday beautiful Pam. I hope you have a wonderful day.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I had a great birthday - spent the entire day at a beautiful spa - it <br/>
has 17 different pools and a big mud pit and all kinds of other stuff. <br/>
It was almost 80 degrees and gorgeous all day and we were there from 9 <br/>
am to 5 pm. It is the first time I&#39;ve ever done anything like that. Then <br/>
I got home and my husband had cleaned the house and bought me flowers. <br/>
We went out to dinner and when we came home I had a very cool gift - a <br/>
new little baby dwarf hamster. We had a little birthday cake and watched <br/>
a little tv. It was really really nice.<br/>
<br/>
The photo of my family was at Roxana&#39;s 21st birthday party - which was <br/>
at my 21 year old niece&#39;s apartment. I&#39;m not sure who took it - it was <br/>
on my camera.<br/>
<br/>
And - I do appreciate and encourage Sandra and lots of what I have to <br/>
say I describe as me channeling her!<br/>

Well- that and I&#39;m a sucker for Australian accents, of course &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
