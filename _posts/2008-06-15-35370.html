<div id="ygrps-yiv-498854662">Just joined the group!  We are an unschooling family with three little ones,<br/>
ages 6, 4, and 2---living in the Portland Oregon area.  We just sold our<br/>
home and will be moving to a new one, but not sure where in the area we&#39;ll<br/>
land just yet!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re excited to expand our unschooling experience by getting chickens,<br/>
goats, a cow, (etc.?) when we move.<br/>
<br/>
We have an interesting perspective about unschooling, as my husband is a<br/>
public school teacher and I was too, prior to having the kids---and we sure<br/>
don&#39;t like what we&#39;ve seen from the inside!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to hear what others do to fill the days and nights with their<br/>
unschooled little ones.<br/>

I couldn&#39;t agree more with Sandra&#39;s comment about being surprised with some<br/>
former teachers saying they find it hard to let go of structure. There are a<br/>
few things I do miss from my classroom days (namely the daily contact and<br/>
relationships developed with lots of different kids with different<br/>
personalities and quirks) but being a slave to the clock and to the<br/>
curriculum are NOT among them!<br/>

years ago; this is the same letter (I keep old emails forever!):<br/>
<br/>
My dh wasn&#39;t too sure about unschooling at first (about 9-10 years<br/>
ago), and was also adamant the kids be in bed and stay there at a<br/>
certain time.  I&#39;d just come home from a one-day conference -- probably<br/>
the first time I heard Sandra speak -- with an armload of interesting<br/>
toys and books and a head full of inspiration.  One of the books was<br/>
about finding Titanic, and included a paper model, which I decided<br/>
Mommy should put together (I really like that kind of thing :-)  I was<br/>
working on it after the kids had gone to bed, but then-7-y.o. Alex got<br/>
up.  He looked at the book and we talked about it as I worked; we<br/>
discovered what a fathom was, and that Titanic came to rest on the<br/>
continental shelf, not the very bottom of the ocean, and I&#39;m sure some<br/>
more interesting things, but those stick in my mind.  About a half hour<br/>
later, Alex went back to bed and I kept gluing.  Dh came in and said,<br/>
&quot;So that&#39;s unschooling.&quot;  He&#39;d overheard the conversation.  I said,<br/>
&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s unschooling.&quot;  Never had an argument after that :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1121298809">Hi Portland People and Everyone else too,<br/>
<br/>
I am new to Portland and kind of new to unschooling.  I have a ds16 <br/>
who has been out of school for a little over a year and a dd10 who <br/>
was out of school for a year then back in for this past year and now <br/>
wants to go back to unschooling (all her choice).  I would love to <br/>
meet more unschooling moms here.<br/>
<br/>
I also have a question for the group.  My extended family is very <br/>
traditional and does not like the idea of the kids not being in <br/>
school at all.  This is not usually a problem but my sister is taking <br/>
my dd to visit the rest of my family for a week this summer.  They <br/>
all know that she has decided not to go to school next fall and I <br/>
know they are going to &#39;work&#39; on her while she is with them.  I can <br/>
and have asked them to leave her alone, but this means nothing to <br/>
them.  Probably because I am the youngest person in the family and <br/>
because my kids dad is not in our lives and I am very different from <br/>
them, they feel justified. I am wondering what I can do or what I can <br/>
say to my dd or to my family. <br/>
<br/>
thank you...<br/>

with her about it all.<br/>
<br/>
Tell her it is okay for her to say, &quot;I know you care about me and I&#39;ll  <br/>
think about what you said.&quot; After that, if they keep on, she can say,  <br/>
&quot;Can we let it go, I promise I&#39;ll think about what you said.&quot; And, if  <br/>
they keep on after that, she can say, &quot;Please drop it.&quot; Role play with  <br/>
her so she feels comfortable with responding sweetly, but assertively.<br/>

I just had a new idea.  It might or might not work for your daughter  <br/>

<br/>
She could take a notebook just for this purpose, and write down their  <br/>
suggestions and justifications about school, and she could say &quot;I&#39;ll  <br/>
think about it.&quot;  If she gives them hope and agreement to some things  <br/>
instead of being defensive, they&#39;ll say much less.  It&#39;s a little  <br/>
like playing dead so the aggressor will go away.<br/>

There&#39;s more, though.  She would have their words in writing.  She  <br/>
could come back later (or you could), with &quot;I thought about the  <br/>
argument that school is necessary for a job, but the unemployment  <br/>
office is full of people with high school diplomas and college  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1543133808">This is really a great idea.  Not only for this situation but for the <br/>
purpose of helping to define and understand for ourselves what we are <br/>
doing here.  <br/>
<br/>
In a recent post, Sandra spoke about (these are my words because I <br/>
can&#39;t find the post) shaping and creating the unschooling experience <br/>
for her family.  In essence, for me this meant that she had a real <br/>
understanding of where she wanted to go and what she wanted to do. I <br/>
loved hearing this and I would love to hear more about it. <br/>
<br/>
From the outside, unschooling can look arbitrary and chaotic.  I <br/>
think this has been a big part of the problem for me as well. Just <br/>
last night, I was taking a walk with Matthew(ds16)and talking about <br/>
our basic need for order and how our experience with unschooling so <br/>
far has really challenged that.  We spoke about how we haven&#39;t really <br/>
established a complete understanding about and for this new life.  I <br/>
don&#39;t think the &#39;un&#39; road is a very easy one to take but I can see <br/>
how it forces consciousness and accountability and respect.  This <br/>
alone is a big enough reward I think.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you again for this suggestion Sandra.  As usual, my small <br/>
problem turned into a big solution.<br/>

<br/>
Thank you for paraphrasing that back. It&#39;s more valuable to me that way.<br/>
<br/>
It surprises me when someone who has been on and around discussions  <br/>
like this can display a huge lack of understanding of unschooling.   <br/>
Most people work on understanding the principles, which makes their  <br/>
decisionmaking easy.  If you know what it should do, and how it  <br/>
should work, then the doing kinda just happens.  If you make the more  <br/>
peaceful decision, the more learning-friendly decision, the more  <br/>
nurturing decision, then how could one get lost?<br/>
<br/>
But it seems sometimes that there are people who don&#39;t intend to get  <br/>
the principles.  They want to hang out with unschoolers and keep  <br/>
asking at every juncture &quot;What do I do now?  How do I do this?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not to discourage questions on the list at all!  It&#39;s just  <br/>
when a questions is particularly naive, I&#39;d feel better if it&#39;s  from  <br/>
a screenname I haven&#39;t seen for three years.<br/>

<br/>
It doesn&#39;t force any of those things.  You&#39;ll need to choose them,  <br/>
and then make decisions that keep them in sight.<br/>
<br/>
I know what you meant, but it&#39;s important for me (for you, for me to)  <br/>
point at what you said.<br/>

especially this:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;There was no &quot;group lead&quot; on that.  I think someone in the family<br/>

momentum.    I wanted momentum.  When it wasn&#39;t there already, I add<br/>
more.&lt;&lt;<br/>

<br/>
The vision of how we want life to be flowing (a must when going<br/>
against mainstream living) is &quot;leading&quot; in a big way, yet in a<br/>
unschooly, get out of the way leadership: directing the flow, and<br/>
making sure the ship doesnt crash...<br/>
<br/>
Since coming on line 3 years ago, not here at first, just to sandra&#39;s<br/>
and joyce&#39;s websites and a forum with alot of unschoolers and ap<br/>
parents on it I have grown confident and sure of what &quot;works&quot; and what<br/>
doesnt, with children, with my partner, with others in life...<br/>
<br/>
when I came on line I was in a big rut: just hearing others living<br/>
fully, awarely as we were trying to (but somehow along the way we were<br/>
 muddying our trail in a horrible way) was enough to re establish my<br/>
vision, but with confidence.  <br/>
<br/>
I *know* where we want to be, if not in detail, in philosophy...and<br/>
this keeps us on track.  <br/>
<br/>
Dh was angry for a while, because me reconnecting with my vision<br/>
somehow dislodged some incongruencies in my way of being with our<br/>
children when he was around vs when he was not.  <br/>
<br/>
He likes to joke now a days, &quot;hey, Im not the boss!&quot; or &quot;you mean, Im<br/>
not the boss!?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
but that was how it was.  I had stopped challenging him about it at<br/>
some point, and just let him &quot;be the boss&quot; but it just kept getting<br/>
worse! lol of course!<br/>
<br/>
But this meant that I wasnt being a very good advocate for my<br/>
children. ...<br/>
<br/>
and regaining my vision, let everything fall back into place, in a<br/>
very lovely way. We are still smoothing some of the wrinkles out, but<br/>
the red carpet is shining bright into the future!<br/>

Re: leading (was: child led learning)<br/>
<br/>
-=-Anyway, I don&#39;t feel as thought I lead, as the adult, nor do I<br/>
feel that they lead--as in child led learning. I kinda feel like we<br/>
are all just going through this together. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m all mixed up and haven&#39;t read these in order, but sometimes the<br/>
truth of a word doesn&#39;t mean it can be used without wrong impressions.<br/>
<br/>
In our family, as activities and learning go, in the overall picture<br/>
of the last 21 years, I have &quot;led&quot; BIGTIME, but what I did was to<br/>
lead us all toward unschooling.  We didn&#39;t muddle toward it<br/>
accidentally as a family.  I designed and created the situation<br/>
(given what I had to work with, which pretty wonderfully included<br/>
Keith having recently gotten a really good job, and us having been<br/>
involved in the SCA a long time) and made sure I really knew what I<br/>
was doing (or trying to do).<br/>
<br/>
There was no &quot;group lead&quot; on that.  I think someone in the family<br/>
needs to feel responsible for making sure there&#39;s cohesion and<br/>
momentum.    I wanted momentum.  When it wasn&#39;t there already, I add<br/>
more.<br/>
<br/>
Still.  Now that our kids are all practically grown (Kirby IS grown;<br/>
21 and living elsewhere), momentum doesn&#39;t have to be monitored in<br/>
half-hour blocks, but maybe in two-day blocks.  And sometimes they<br/>
have so much planned and happening that all I need to do is check to<br/>
make sure they have the clothes they need for jobs, friends&#39;<br/>
weddings, trips; that the car-sharing plans will work out (we&#39;re two<br/>
cars for four people, kind of; Keith has a motorcycle, and there&#39;s a<br/>
van without air conditioning that sucks gasoline like a van and Holly<br/>
and I don&#39;t like to drive it anyway, so I dont&#39; count that)...  I&#39;m<br/>
more background logistics some weeks than big planner.<br/>
<br/>
As to being the person who make sure it&#39;s all happening, though, the<br/>
director-style leader, that&#39;s me.  But their learning isn&#39;t &quot;led&quot; by<br/>
me.  Sometimes it is nudged or augmented or sparkled up by me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-678999545">-= The vision of how we want life to be flowing (a must when going<br/>
against mainstream living) is &quot;leading&quot; in a big way, yet in a<br/>
unschooly, get out of the way leadership: directing the flow, and<br/>
making sure the ship doesnt crash...=-<br/>
<br/>
The above made me think of a post I recently put up on my blog. I<br/>
thought I would add it here:<br/>
<br/>
More thoughts on parenting<br/>
<br/>
One thing that has amazed me the past two years is how the &quot;mainstream<br/>
way&quot; can seem so.... inevitable... inescapable... I guess that is why it<br/>
is called &quot;MAINSTREAM!&quot; (maybe is should be mainRAPIDS, or<br/>
mainHUGEROARINGRIVER&quot; -- GET OUT BEFORE YOU DROWN IN IT!!! )<br/>
<br/>
I know what was really, REALLY liberating for me was realizing that I<br/>
can do things differently and it is NOT WRONG to do so. That I can do<br/>
things differently and BE HAPPY (a lot happier than some people seem to<br/>
be doing things the &quot;normal&quot; way.) That I can do things in a way that<br/>
feels right and natural to me and not fight it.<br/>
<br/>
A good example is the whole &quot;sleep issue&quot;. I first read about<br/>
co-sleeping while I was still pregnant (one of Dr. Sears&#39; books). I<br/>
loved the idea, it sounded so wonderful. But then MG went without a<br/>
fight to the crib and slept well at 5 weeks. Well, she slept well until<br/>
she was about 5 months anyways, and then started to wake up every hour<br/>
or so! Man was I tired for a couple of months.<br/>
<br/>
I started to sleep with her when we went on vacation and she never went<br/>
back to the crib. I loved it! At first we didn&#39;t really talk about it to<br/>
family and friends unless it came up. I heard all sorts of thing from<br/>
people -- mostly what a BIG mistake it was. I heard someone talking<br/>
about her own 1 year old son and &quot;Ferberizing&quot; and how much harder it<br/>
was to walk away from their crying when they could scream, &quot;Mama mama!!&quot;<br/>
She concluded, that you &quot;have&quot; to do it though.... most people seem to<br/>
assume that eventually you WILL have to let them cry it out, and it is<br/>
easier to do when they are little. If you sleep with them then you are<br/>
just helping them form bad habits, no one will get good sleep, and you<br/>
certainly must be doing some kid of damage to your marriage! Also, when<br/>
and how are you going to get them out of your bed?<br/>
<br/>
I used to worry more about these things, even though I loved sleeping<br/>
with my little girl (and I can see in my husband&#39;s face that he enjoys<br/>
it too). I think that one problem people have is with the idea that you<br/>
MAY sleep with them for a lot longer than you planned on. Or that<br/>
sleeping arrangements may be flexible. Or that kids need help to fall<br/>
asleep. Personally, I am happily accepting all of these possibilities.<br/>
<br/>
I like drifting peacefully with my family on our own little side stream<br/>
thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Ok I&#39;m back. This is not the post anymore... The more I read about<br/>
unschooling and think about how I want to live life the more I realize<br/>
that I just need to DO it. I don&#39;t need to convince anyone else (family<br/>
included). I&#39;m also realizing that what I&#39;m doing is not really all that<br/>
&quot;radical&quot; although it may seem that way to others. It helps me to not<br/>
feel that I am being radical -- then I am not so defensive. I am just<br/>
living my life in the way that I think is best for me and my family. And<br/>
I hope to be a good example for others that there may be a more<br/>
enjoyable, even BETTER way to live. &quot;They&quot; (whoever they may be!) won&#39;t<br/>
get the message either if they are feeling defensive. I am also<br/>
continually surprised that MORE people don&#39;t try to live by at least<br/>
some of these principles -- don&#39;t people want to live peacefully,<br/>
joyfully? To enjoy their children and partners to the maximum? I really<br/>
don&#39;t understand... but I am trying to be patient and kind both with<br/>
myself and others.<br/>
