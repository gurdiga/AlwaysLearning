<br/>
This isn&#39;t anonymous but I don&#39;t remember who it was.<br/>
<br/>
Did anyone save the original or make a note then of who wrote it that  <br/>
first time?   One site uses it without citation and one uses it with  <br/>
a citation, but it wasn&#39;t a name I remembered or recognized.  Maybe  <br/>
it was someone who had a cool AOL screenname at the time and wasn&#39;t  <br/>
using her own name.<br/>
<br/>
The owner of the site listing it as anonymous is willing to credit  <br/>
it, if I can find out who it was in the first place.   Help!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-263905881">Who is the name you don&#39;t recognize?<br/>
A poster on one of the HEM lists used to use it in her sig line and showed<br/>
in as &quot;anonymous&quot; in 2006 and through August 07.  Then in October 07 started<br/>
listing &quot;Barbara Lamping&quot; as author.  I have not tried to track her down and<br/>
ask why she changed.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure I &quot;heard&quot; the phrase  long before 2006 but not sure I ever<br/>
saw it attributed to anyone.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-443191567">-=-Who is the name you don&#39;t recognize?-=-<br/>
<br/>
The one you named.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t  name I recognized, so I was wondering.  I remember the day  <br/>
it was first posted and the responses were fun and lots of people  <br/>
cited it and referred to it, for a while there.  It was years ago.   <br/>
Eight years, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not even so much that I want the name.  I want help to find the  <br/>
original post.  I&#39;m collecting ideas and clues on the side, so if  <br/>
anyone else has ideas, please send them to me privately.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

it, but I KNOW it&#39;s there somewhere.  That is the first time I heard it<br/>
and for some reason I attribute it to Deb Lewis.  Perhaps she said it,<br/>
or someone with a similar name said it?  I started reading on the<br/>
unschooling dot com boards in 99/00 and I do remember it from the<br/>
earlier days.<br/>
<br/>
I never did the AOL thing, so I have no idea if anyone used it there.</div>

<br/>
No, not that either.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s evidence that the mom who wrote that first thing  <br/>
considers unschooling to be free time, fun time, library day, field  <br/>
day, pep rally.  I think she&#39;s still thinking schoolishly, and though  <br/>
she knows kids can learn in unstructured ways, she&#39;s not going to live  <br/>
there.  (I could be wrong.)<br/>
<br/>
When I read it first I was thinking vegetarian six days, meat on the  <br/>
seventh.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-277793885">I think it&#39;s like saying we won&#39;t control food one day a week.<br/>
Healthy sit down meals, no snacks between meals, dessert only if you<br/>
finish a certain amount of your dinner.  Except on Fridays.  On<br/>
fridays you can have doritos and ice cream for breakfast.  You can eat<br/>
whatever you want whenever you want.<br/>
<br/>
It will be doritos and ice cream all day long on Fridays and then mom<br/>
will say &quot;See!  I tried not controlling food and it doesn&#39;t work!  My<br/>
kid will only eat junk all day long.&quot; and then will go back to<br/>
controlling food 7 days a week.<br/>
<br/>
If the kid sees that coming, maybe they can figure out to eat a small<br/>
enough amount so that mom doesn&#39;t freak... but that will only be<br/>
because the threat is there.  It isn&#39;t the same thing as not being<br/>
controlling about food.  It&#39;s just not not not the same.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know that this stuff will work in general if it is done part<br/>
way. I have heard people telling stories about backing off one area<br/>
(e.g. &quot;we are unschooling writing&quot;) ended up helping, but I don&#39;t<br/>
think it is the same as actually unschooling and I think that the<br/>
stories about how great things can be don&#39;t really apply.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe for this kid, backing off one day a week is a huge improvement<br/>
and a great thing to do.  It could be really good for the child and<br/>
their relationship. It isn&#39;t unschooling, though, and there will be<br/>
very big differences in a child that is actually unschooled and a<br/>
child whose mom backs off one day a week.<br/>

I think that&#39;s bang-on.<br/>
I wonder whether on those unschooling days the mom is still directing  <br/>
the children to do, or if she&#39;s measuring and judging?  If so, she  <br/>
might consider that unschooling is hard work.<br/>
But if she doesn&#39;t &quot;make&quot; them do anything, and they&#39;re used to being  <br/>
directed and required, might they take that &quot;unschooling day&quot; to do  <br/>
what the mom would describe as &quot;nothing&quot;?<br/>
