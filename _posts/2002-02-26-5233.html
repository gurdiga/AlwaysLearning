<div id="ygrps-yiv-650182732"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; There&#39;s also a group around here (in the Santa Cruz Mountains) who were<br/>
&gt; homeschooling long before John Holt did much!  They were homeschooling<br/>
&gt; in the 70s - I think most of them would have been considered hippies.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And oh, there&#39;s a pioneer who inspired me on this path.  Patricia Joudry, a Canadian writer, and her husband John,  were doing this in 1961.  The were living in England at the time. She wrote about their experiences in  ...and the children played  , which was published in 1975.<br/>
<br/>
Some quotes from this book:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We didn&#39;t educate our children; we just gave them freedom to be.  They educated themselves and each other.  Nobody pushed them, nobody could have stopped them&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;After a good deal of trial and error we finally came to our senses and said, &quot;Okay.  There are the books.  If you want to know about them anytime, just ask.  If you don&#39;t, skip it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Patricia wrote about extended nursing as follows:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;A friend asked: &quot;Isn&#39;t that child ever going to give up the breast?&quot;  &quot;Why, certainly, she&#39;ll have to,&quot; said John.  &quot;Patricia will die eventually.&quot;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As she did in October 2000, in Powell River, B.C., at the age of 79.<br/>
