<div id="ygrps-yiv-110725423">I have ordered the original version of The Backyard Scientist and we<br/>
have been making goop, mixing potions (water, oil, food coloring,<br/>
glitter, sprinkles ... ) and making more volcanoes. My daughter has<br/>
gotten in on it now too and she&#39;s having just as much fun as Jack.<br/>
Yesterday while we were mixing potions Jack said, &quot;Oh I want to go to<br/>
science class!!&quot; Olivia said (who has been to some of 1st grade), &quot;You<br/>
would be in 1st grade if you went (to school) and they DON&#39;T have<br/>
science class.&quot; I said that they probably do have a science class but<br/>
I don&#39;t remember ever playing with stuff in science class. I only<br/>
remember paperwork and tests.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The conversation about class and school ended there because we were<br/>
mixing stuff and having fun with that but that was the second time in<br/>
as many days that he has brought up school. I want to be able to say<br/>
the correct things to him and I don&#39;t want him to feel he is missing<br/>
something. I also don&#39;t think he is actually asking to go to school.<br/>
<br/>
I am planning on getting worms for under the sink (for me, but they<br/>
will be fascinated that mom has worms under the sink- on purpose) and<br/>
a rock polisher (they love rocks) so they will have more sciencey type<br/>
stuff to play with, but neither of those things are things they have<br/>
asked for. He wakes up asking to do an experiment.<br/>
<br/>
I googled around a little trying to find a science class (like a dance<br/>
class or karate class, not a school) but didn&#39;t find anything.<br/>
<br/>
He seems very happy and satisfied playing with what we have, so I&#39;m<br/>
not sure how to handle the school or class thing when it comes up.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The lid to my little worm bin was intended to wedge in the top, but  <br/>
by the time I trimmed it, it&#39;s a cardboard platform that lies on top  <br/>
of the dirt.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve discovered that this is PERFECT, and I wish I had thought of it  <br/>
(instead of stumbling onto it from error).<br/>
<br/>
#1, air gets in around, so the cardboard doesn&#39;t get soggy.<br/>
<br/>
#2, as the worms process the scrap and the dirt goes down, the  <br/>
cardboard lid goes down too!!  So I can tell by looking if they need  <br/>
another dose.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve changed the dirt out once.  It was very exciting for me, a  <br/>
little exciting for Holly, and a little baffling maybe (my  <br/>
excitement) for Holly&#39;s boyfriend.<br/>

<br/>
When my daughter was about 8 or 9 she said she wanted to go to school. <br/>
I knew she had these ideas about it and I knew they probably weren&#39;t<br/>
very accurate.  But I did want her to be able to check it out and make<br/>
an &quot;informed&quot; decision so I scheduled a tour with the principal of our<br/>
local elementary school.  She&#39;d been to the school before to have lunch<br/>
with friends so she knew how that went but I asked the principal to take<br/>
her into a classroom (this was during the summer) and show her what it<br/>
would be like and we also asked what they would be learning about that<br/>
year.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily for me she decided home was a more eventful and fun place to be!<br/>
Plus she found out that kids didn&#39;t actually break out in song and dance<br/>
in the cafeteria (high school musical reference)! bwg!<br/>
<br/>
footnote: when I called the principal ahead of time to schedule this<br/>
tour I told her that I really didn&#39;t want my daughter to go and that I<br/>
bet she wished she had school full of kids who really wanted to be<br/>
there!  This principal was soooo nice to Lydia, and I was glad, she<br/>
really tried to &quot;sell&quot; it to her.  And I was REALLY glad when Lydia<br/>
chose not to go.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;*** Again I think your doing a great job...keeping him supplied in<br/>
science fun.  If school issue keeps coming up....you could acutaly<br/>

<br/>
Elisabeth&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how close you are to a university but we&#39;re pretty close to<br/>
one here and I&#39;ve taken the kids up to the campus a few times and<br/>
they&#39;ve had a GREAT time.  In the geology building they&#39;ve been given<br/>
cool rocks by professors and shown tons of fossils.  There&#39;s an<br/>
anthropology building that is like a museum with lots of cool things in<br/>
display cases.  The entomology department also sets up tours with bugs<br/>
to look at and touch!  The engineering department has lego robotics type<br/>
classes (for elementary age kids) and they were really flexible.  From a<br/>
one day tour/class to setting up a six week class.<br/>
<br/>
A few other moms and I used to do a &quot;science club&quot;.  We&#39;d do things like<br/>
go to a pond with buckets and nets, go to a fossil gorge and let the<br/>
kids find fossils, go to the science center together, set up<br/>
experiments, movies, build forts, make scarecrows, start seeds, etc. <br/>
Many times we&#39;d plan nothing and let them play and the moms and I would<br/>
laugh about all the science that was still happening.  Sleeding<br/>
(pulley&#39;s and angles), digging in the dirt, climbing on a<br/>
playset...&quot;Science&quot; is endless because science is EVERYWHERE!!<br/>
<br/>
Today we went on a field trip with friends to a bee farm...it was really<br/>
cool!  And the honey straight from the farm seemed to taste even better.<br/>
We can&#39;t wait until the end of summer to go back to get honeycombs!<br/>
<br/>
Just remember, keep thinking outside the box and keep on googling!!:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-838261944">At first I thought we could do diet coke and mentos eruption in the<br/>
shower, but after watching more videos I think that&#39;s a very bad idea.<br/>
I might be able to do it in the park. We don&#39;t have a backyard, we<br/>
have a strip of concrete with neighbor&#39;s windows very close to it.<br/>
Great for hopscotch but probably very bad for mentos and diet coke<br/>
experiments.<br/>
<br/>
We have a science center here so we are going to become members. My<br/>
kids have been to science centers in other cities but not our own.<br/>
Funny how that works.<br/>
<br/>
He asks as soon as he gets up to do experiments and by that he means<br/>
he wants to mix stuff to see what happens. I had the idea of using a<br/>
plastic bin and putting the stuff that he can mix with in the bin. I&#39;m<br/>
hoping The Backyard Scientist gets here next week.<br/>
<br/>
I thought rock candy would be a neat thing for my kids to make but<br/>
Jack didn&#39;t get excited about it. He wants to see things happen. I&#39;m<br/>
still going to make the rock candy though, I think it sounds fun. And<br/>
I think once he sees the sugar crystals growing in the jar he will be<br/>
interested, but it&#39;s not a fizzing, bubbling thing he can stick his<br/>
hands in.<br/>
<br/>
That is a cool website. I bookmarked it.<br/>

didn&#39;t. It was very whiny and all about me. And just as quickly as the<br/>
Hannah Montana interested started it ended. She hasn&#39;t even turned the<br/>
tv on in the last two days and I&#39;ve asked her a few times if she<br/>
wanted to watch it.<br/>

During the time when she was watching a lot but after the time I wrote<br/>
the post I really watched her watching tv and then I watched her<br/>
playing when she wasn&#39;t watching tv and she was singing a lot. I&#39;d ask<br/>
her a question and she would sing me the answer. She also dances<br/>
instead of walking, but she did that before Hannah Montana too.</div>

place we&#39;d get ice when *I* was a kid, so cool ::g::) for $10 and keep it in<br/>
a sled (it was long, plastic and had 3&quot; sides all around). We&#39;d use a hammer<br/>
to get smaller chunks  for making smoky liquids (different thickness of<br/>
liquids give different kinds of &quot;smoke&quot;) and use the bigger chunk for<br/>
&quot;dancing coins&quot; and &quot;singing pop cans&quot; (yeah, the coins *jump* when left on<br/>
the dry ice and the full, closed soda cans make this amazing high pitched<br/>
squeal as they vibrate across the surface). Leather gloves are the best<br/>
though our regular winter gloves did fine :)<br/>
When we stored in a cooler, when not playing with it, it lasted 4-5 days!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We&#39;ve kicked our ice cream cans while going on a hike - at the end of  <br/>
the hike, we eat the ice cream.<br/>
<br/>
How about a Make Your Own Root Beer kit? I think Hearthsong carries  <br/>
them &lt;hearthsong.com&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Also - really fun - pour milk onto a plate so it covers most of the  <br/>
plate. Put drops of food coloring of different colors here and there  <br/>
on the milk. Then drop drops of dishwashing detergent onto the milk.  <br/>
Watch what happens and play around with it.<br/>
Well - here are more detailed directions (but my vague ones would  <br/>
work): &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.kids.union.edu/swirlingMilk.htm">http://www.kids.union.edu/swirlingMilk.htm</a>&gt;<br/>

Experiment of the Week email list. It is awesome! And all his past  <br/>
ones are archived on his website: &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.krampf.com/news.html">http://www.krampf.com/news.html</a>&gt;<br/>

&gt; I thought rock candy would be a neat thing for my kids to make but<br/>
&gt; Jack didn&#39;t get excited about it. He wants to see things happen. I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; still going to make the rock candy though, I think it sounds fun. And<br/>
&gt; I think once he sees the sugar crystals growing in the jar he will be<br/>
&gt; interested, but it&#39;s not a fizzing, bubbling thing he can stick his<br/>
&gt; hands in.<br/>

liquid!  One day though, one day, it will be rock candy and sometimes <br/>
it&#39;s fun to forget about something and then remember it later.</div>

special exhibits that come and go and some of those have been  <br/>
highlights of my kids&#39; lives. It also has the lovely advantage of  <br/>
being FREE!!!<br/>
<br/>
There is also Kidspace - near the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, which isn&#39;t  <br/>
too far for you.<br/>
<br/>
We have a nice hands-on science museum in Orange County, in Santa Ana.  <br/>
(Discovery Center) which would be worth the trip.<br/>
<br/>
He might be interested in Destination imagination - have a look at  <br/>
some of the technical challenges kids get involved with there:<br/>

<br/>
What I used to do was read through all the science experiment websites  <br/>
and books - I didn&#39;t call them &quot;experiments&quot; or &quot;science&quot; - but I did  <br/>
pick out the ones that sounded fun to do. For fun.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t worry about explanations, unless a kid was asking. I figured  <br/>
that if they had a need to know the name of the phenomenon, whatever  <br/>
it was, it would be some time in the future, not now. They don&#39;t need  <br/>
to know that it is because of surface tension, but it still gives them  <br/>
a fun experience with surface tension that will help them &quot;get it&quot; if  <br/>
they ever do need to know it.<br/>
