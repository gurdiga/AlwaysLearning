<div id="ygrps-yiv-1749679403">Are there people here from Michigan? I&#39;ve writtent  the Michigan  <br/>
Unschoolers list, but there&#39;s not much time left.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m to be interviewed June 3/Thursday by phone, on a talk show in  <br/>
Michigan.  Scott Winter and Michelle McCormick, &quot;Mouth 2 Mouth with  <br/>
Scott and Michelle.<br/>
<br/>
Here are the links I was sent and one of them should have a  phone  <br/>
number and such:<br/>

Producer<br/>
&quot;Mouth 2 Mouth with Scott and Michelle&quot;<br/>

They&#39;re calling me at 9:35.<br/>
<br/>
I would be happy to have someone (or several) from Michigan call in  <br/>
and give them real, local information.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I had known about it all sooner, but I was travelling all day  <br/>
today and didn&#39;t check e-mail until I had gotten to Quebec, and to  <br/>
Bea&#39;s house (where Holly lives) and had a house tour and a nap.  So  <br/>
not much notice.<br/>

<br/>
Could someone who is on that list pass this on, please?  My note to  <br/>
the list was too long to go through, and i don&#39;t need to be a member  <br/>
anyway.  I&#39;ve tried sending it to the list owner, but as there are  <br/>
only 11 hours left, I don&#39;t want to risk failing to get the message to  <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
