I&#39;m always shocked when I hear this crap, probably because I spend so much <br/>
time with you guys!<br/>

It is people like you that doesn&#39;t allow me to send my children to public<br/>
or Christian schools.  If I take your relativistic approach my child<br/>
could say to me - I dont like carrots.  Okay, so you don&#39;t give them<br/>
carrots.  I don&#39;t like apples.  Okay, you don&#39;t give them apples.  I like<br/>
french fries.  Ok, you can have french fries.  So what happens over time.<br/>
You have a fat child with multiple problems but they did what they<br/>
enjoyed.  Education is not always enjoyable and not always interesting<br/>
but it is necessary.  Why is it that we think our children have to always<br/>
like what they are doing before they do it?  I didn&#39;t think I would like<br/>
the game of golf until I played it.  Now I love it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-734648171">Hi there:  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a newbie on this message board, branching out into unschooling <br/>
this year.  I have been reading, reading, reading and <br/>
just &quot;listening&quot; but I really had to respond to this post.<br/>
<br/>
The post that that &quot;wise parent&quot; wrote is exactly the philosophy that <br/>
kept my children AND myself miserable for years in homeschooling.  <br/>
I&#39;ve tried every curriculum figuring it was THE one.  Well, at the <br/>
end of last &quot;school year&quot; we were all burnt out and miserable.  Our <br/>
family felt like it was falling apart.  I couldn&#39;t even read a book <br/>
to my dd because she didn&#39;t want me to.  We got together as a family <br/>
and have been deschooling from homeschooling, knowing that <br/>
unschooling is the way to go.  Our family is so much more happier for <br/>
it.  <br/>
<br/>
That post touched a nerve with me.  I am in a support group here in <br/>
CT that pretty much promotes that philosophy.  I&#39;m pulling away from <br/>
it and hanging out with like-minded people.  As for my close friends <br/>
that are still using the boxed curriculum, I will keep my mouth shut <br/>
and just enjoy their friendships.  I thank God for these message <br/>
boards where I can learn and follow my heart.  Kelly, if you do <br/>
respond I totally want to read it!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
Sheila<br/>
