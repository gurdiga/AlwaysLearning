Anti-depressants can help when people have become very sludgy from depression.  They can help thoughts to flow again, But it sounds like you want to wait until you’re off zoloft to find ways to be more peaceful.   That’s not any good for you or the children.<br/>

Do the rest of the work ,like deep breaths, exercise, etc.....what ever works for you.<br/>
If meds work then that is wonderful!-=-<br/>
<br/>
There are no med that will “work” if the desired result is learning to live better by making ever-better decisions (and more decisions, consciously, throughout each day).  <br/>
<br/>
There is no medication that will “fix” depression or anxiety forever, but it can make life better for a while.  I think any doctor who prescribes an anti-depressant without requiring that it also be accompanied by counselling or therapy should lose his license, but that’s because I’m looking at what helps people learn to do better, and doctors (in the U.S., who work for HMOs or who deal with insurance companies) are often doing what benefits them or their employers, without so much regard for their patients.<br/>
<br/>
There have been a few times, over the past 25 years, that I’ve taken Prozac for a while WITH COUNSELING when I was frazzled, overwhelmed, or depressed.  Not always the same situations.  And if I was at the point where I wasn’t thinking clearly and was winding down from really caring, Prozac could help boost my thinking up well enough that I could get traction again.<br/>
<br/>
I have had friends and relatives who took one drug or another and expected to keep their bad habits, their negativity, their cynicism, and that the drugs would somehow fix their lives and make them better, happier people.  That wasn’t healthy physically or financially, and those who had kids—it wasn’t helping their children, nor their families, nor their marriages, long term.  Some of those friends and relatives didn’t have kids or spouses (or had, and didn’t anymore).<br/>
<br/>
So assuming that the question here is what will help unschooling—the drug  might help, but NOT MAGICALLY, and not without changes on the part of the person who wants to learn ways to avoid needing the drugs so much, or so long, in the future.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-51107122"><div id="ygrps-yiv-51107122ygrps-yiv-1338166531"><div>I too have struggled with anxiety and panic attacks (since childhood) and episodically as an adult.  I&#39;ve learned that  rage and yelling responses are intrinsically connected to my anxiety. My own childhood family was riddled with rage and violence as the default parenting style, so that I&#39;ve  had to very consciously work to set-up more peaceful defaults in my own psyche and responses. I&#39;ve noticed over the years that anxiety and feeling overwhelmed are really the sole cause of unclear thinking and falling into anger and frustration responses for me. I&#39;m not always patient still,  though I&#39;ve come to see it as a daily practice rather than an end-point, to always strive for joy and peace and to regularly work to develop my emotional and verbal vocabulary so that I&#39;m always becoming more peaceful and capable of communicating in clearer ways to both myself and my family, and re-set those unexpected defaults in myself.  </div><div id="ygrps-yiv-51107122ygrps-yiv-1338166531AppleMailSignature"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-51107122ygrps-yiv-1338166531AppleMailSignature">A few things that really help me: </div><div id="ygrps-yiv-51107122ygrps-yiv-1338166531AppleMailSignature"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-51107122ygrps-yiv-1338166531AppleMailSignature">-Like  becoming able, in my 40&#39;s, to keep my car clean, keep my closet somewhat organized, I look at becoming a more peaceful, joyful parent, partner, parent, and person as a practice rather than a goal. This helps me focus more on the progress than the missteps and mistakes. In many Always Learning threads over the years, the idea of noticing a difficult moment as opposed to coining a whole day as difficult has really allowed me to forgive myself in moments of faltering and more easily able to access and implement the idea that I can still make different and repairing choices even in the very next moment. I notice that my vocabulary and skill set grows every day, week, and year, and trust that eventually it will be something I fully and always access as default---because it&#39;s what I want and value deeply for myself and family and so it is becoming. </div><div id="ygrps-yiv-51107122ygrps-yiv-1338166531AppleMailSignature"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-51107122ygrps-yiv-1338166531AppleMailSignature">-A huge booster for me is to read something everyday that helps me stay on-course with my desire for peaceful and joyful living and parenting, and find new perspectives and approaches in line with my desire.  I find that even just a little bit keeps me conscientious, inspired and more confident.

<br/>
Beautifully put.<br/>
<br/>
Better unschoolers find themselves becoming better people.  I didn’t expect that, years ago, when I was helping people unschool, but now 25 years after Kirby didn’t go to kindergarten, I have seen it hundreds of times—lives unfolding in all directions toward peace and contentment.<br/>
<br/>
I’ve also seen a few dozen cases where people absolutely balked at any suggestion that there was such a thing as “better,” and clung to the idea that pessimism and cynicism were healthy and a mark of intelligence.  Most of them divorced or put their kids back in school (or both), and some of them limped through all their years of unschooling with their cynicism still pouring out, but their children weren’t as relaxed, weren’t as whole and bright-eyed, as they might have been othewise.<br/>
<br/>
This is the big surprise prize:  &quot;better tools for coping with things not seemingly related to unschooling or kids.”<br/>

<br/>
I don’t know how old you are, but if you have young children and your full hormones, there will be changes coming before your “life long” plays out.  There have been changes in your mind and body before, and there will be more.<br/>
<br/>
-=-my reality is that I have to take them if my family and I are going to live well-=-<br/>
<br/>
I can’t let a “have to” like that go by without comment.<br/>
If you CHOOSE to take them, that is a world away from the powerless smallness of “I have to take them.”<br/>
<br/>
-=-I&#39;ve been in counseling for years-=-<br/>
<br/>
If the counselor’s suggestions were way bigger and better than the ideas that make unschooling work, you have a great counselor!<br/>
<br/>
Many people pay money to spend time away from their kids hearing things that aren’t all that hepful.  A fair number of people have discovered they can save that time and money (and avoid future depressing and malaise) by becoming really great unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/principles/">http://sandradodd.com/principles/</a><br/>
(the links on the lift, Pam Sorooshian’s list of principles is good. (It might not be THE list, but it&#39;s a list—I don’t think people need “a list” but it’s good to use it as a kind of shopping list to find a few for you to work on.)<br/>
<br/>
Read a little, TRY A LITTLE<br/>
Wait a while, watch.<br/>
<br/>
Reading *about* unschooling is like reading a cookbook but never cooking, or looking at patterns, but never sewing.<br/>
<br/>
By unschooling, and by improving that, you might find that your assertion of “my whole life” will be something you look back on as a fleeting belief.<br/>
