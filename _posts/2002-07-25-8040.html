<div id="ygrps-yiv-1087993963">I&#39;m about to go play games with my collected family and two of Carol Rice&#39;s <br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
My husband Keith left a card by my keyboard this morning.  He&#39;s really <br/>
careful about picking out cards, when he doesn&#39;t just get me to do it for <br/>
them.  So I know he read this and chose it for a reason.   It&#39;s long, but I&#39;m <br/>
going to share the text here.<br/>
<br/>
---------<br/>
Today I wish I could run back through time,<br/>
back to when you were little.<br/>
<br/>
I would try to find you on your birthday--in the middle of celebrating <br/>
or, even better, at some quiet moment when you were alone.<br/>
<br/>
And if I knew what I know now, I would tell you:  <br/>
Never forget the hope and joy, the aliveness, of this moment.<br/>
Never forget that you deserve happiness, <br/>
that your life is precious to so many people.  <br/>
And never forget how very much I care about you.<br/>
<br/>
----------------<br/>
<br/>
And he came in and I was crying, and he showed me a grocery list and asked if <br/>
there was anything else he should get, and I couldn&#39;t read the grocery list. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1912273827">Thanks, Meghan<br/>
<br/>
The girls and I made a cake today.  They sang happy birthday and then<br/>
they sang Happy Happy Birthday, Happy Happy Birthday in the tune of that<br/>
commercial. You know the one, I think it&#39;s a Carl&#39;s Jr commercial.. It<br/>
was very cute.  But then I had to relight the candles three times so<br/>
everyone had a turn blowing out the candles.  It&#39;s so much fun having<br/>
kids!<br/>
