<div id="ygrps-yiv-2035140499">Hello, everyone!! I am new to this list but not new to unschooling. I <br/>
have to admit, (with an embarassed grin) that I have, at various <br/>
times over the years been sucked into periods of using..that bad <br/>
word..structure imposed by me. Well... some people just take awhile <br/>
to learn. I have a wonderful husband, who is the opposite of some of <br/>
the husbands I&#39;ve heard about on some of the unschooling message <br/>
boards. Actually, he is the die hard unschooler of the family. He and <br/>
my oldest son, who will be 18 on the first day of Spring keep <br/>
bringing me back to an unschooling mindset. From my present <br/>
perspective, I appreciate that from them. I&#39;ve tried to use all kinds <br/>
of &quot;curriculum&quot; on him and he always politely (OK sometimes not so <br/>
politely) declined to follow it. Whenever I get on a &quot;structure <br/>
Kick&quot;, my husband says &quot;Why!?!&quot; and we give it up after a few weeks <br/>
and have to detox and watch westerns or sci-fi movies for a week or <br/>
so. <br/>
     I feel like one of those people who get up at an AA meeting and <br/>
say &quot;Hello my name is Elissa, I am a Structureholic&quot;. I have known <br/>
better from the beginning, my mom read John Holt!!! She sent us to <br/>
school because she thought she would go to jail if she didn&#39;t but <br/>
encouraged us to participate as little as possible and pursue our own <br/>
interests. My sister dropped out ... I guess I get sucked into the <br/>
thinking of some of my conservative Christian friends and do not want <br/>
them to disapprove of me...actually they already do...my son is such <br/>
a non-conformist who has complete freedom...Someone advised me once <br/>
not to let him go to camp unless he got caught up on his schoolwork. <br/>
I thought Yeah...Right! I did not take that advice, needless to say. <br/>
I have finally realized that I cannot live in both worlds. As I said, <br/>
it takes some people awhile to grasp simple concepts!!!<br/>
     Anyway, I am hoping this list will help me to stay committed to <br/>
what I know is right for my family...Unschooling!!! I have a 14 year <br/>
old daughter who ignores my attempts at structure, a 10 year old son <br/>
who is just getting it about reading, a 7 year old son who is also <br/>
just getting it about reading, a three year old boy and a baby girl. <br/>
I would really like to get out of my bad habit of &quot;schoolish <br/>
thinking&quot; and be on the same page with the rest of my family!!!<br/>
<br/>
    Have a great day!!<br/>
              -Elissa</div>

Ever since I got back from the conference in Saskatoon, I&#39;ve planned to read <br/>
through the e-mail I missed, and hadn&#39;t done it, but I&#39;m at least going to <br/>
look at the Always Learning mail!!<br/>
<br/>
So with apologies for being a month late, I really liked this description of <br/>
your big family, Elissa_8, and espeically the movie de-tox.  <br/>
<br/>
After telling my husband yesterday that I&#39;ve been sleeping REALLY well <br/>
lately, I&#39;m up at 4:00 a.m. having been awake for nearly an hour, just <br/>
restless and uncomfortable.  So here I am.<br/>
<br/>
I had stories to tell you all anyway.<br/>
