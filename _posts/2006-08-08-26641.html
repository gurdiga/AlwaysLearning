<div id="ygrps-yiv-1480981869">We often tell people that they have to decide to unschool, they can&#39;t  <br/>
just dip their toes into it to find out what it is like, because they  <br/>
won&#39;t know what it is like until they&#39;re really committed. Things  <br/>
happen when you make the choice to DO it - when kids are trusted,  <br/>
they change, for example.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a great quote someone posted to my state list that I think is  <br/>
relevant:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Until one is committed, there is hesitancy, the chance to draw back,<br/>
always ineffectiveness. Concerning all acts of initiative (and creation)<br/>
there is one elementary truth, the ignorance of which kills countless<br/>
ideas and splendid plans: that the moment one definitely commits<br/>
oneself, then Providence moves too. All sorts of things occur to help<br/>
one that would never otherwise have occurred. A whole stream of events<br/>
issues from the decision, raising in one&#39;s favor all manner of<br/>
unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance, which no man<br/>
could have dreamed would have come his way.&quot;<br/>

The author is<br/>
William Hutchinson Murray and here is a blurb from Wikipedia&#39;s<br/>
article about him. For the entire article, see: &lt;http://<br/>
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._H._Murray&gt;<br/>
<br/>
At the outbreak of WWII, he joined the Argyll and Sutherland<br/>
Highlanders and was posted to the Middle East and north Africa where<br/>
he was captured during the Western Desert Campaign. He then spent<br/>
three years in Prisoner of War camps in Italy (Chieti), Germany<br/>
(Moosberg, Brunswick) and Czechoslovakia (Marisch Trubeau Oflag VIII-<br/>
F). While imprisoned, wrote a book entitled Mountaineering In<br/>
Scotland. The first draft of the work was written on the only paper<br/>
available to him - rough toilet paper. The manuscript was found and<br/>
destroyed by the Gestapo. To the incredulity of his fellow prisoners,<br/>
Murray&#39;s response to the loss was to start again, despite the risk of<br/>
its loss and that his physical condition was so poor from the near<br/>
starvation diet that he believed he would never climb again. The<br/>
rewritten work was finally published in 1947 and was followed by the<br/>
sequel, Undiscovered Scotland in 1951. Both concentrate on Scottish<br/>
winter climbing and were widely credited with helping to inspire the<br/>
post-war renaissance in the sport. Though written in an evocative,<br/>
rather pantheistic, style, somewhat too romantic for modern tastes,<br/>
they are of significant literary value.<br/>
