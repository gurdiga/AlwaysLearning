<div id="ygrps-yiv-2053905475">I have had a couple of really fabulous days here and wanted to share.<br/>
Yesterday we went to the park (it was sunny and 70 degrees) and then to the <br/>
library and the health food co-op.<br/>
The boys figured out that the library had books on speaking Japanese and <br/>
picked out  a few for perusal, they are very fascinated with Japanes anime <br/>
and the language.<br/>
So after picking up some chocolate soy milk and such treats, we finally <br/>
headed home. <br/>
Sierra pulled out the Perler bead set that we&#39;d won at the SC conference and <br/>
asked me if I&#39;d show her how it worked. Well the boys saw that happening and <br/>
joined into the fun. <br/>
They pulled out one of the Japanese language books from the library and <br/>
proceeded to make symbols with the beads.<br/>
(You place the beads on a mold and then melt them together to make a <br/>
coaster-like thingy)<br/>
Trevor made one that stood for calamity/evil (but he&#39;s the one that has <br/>
recently painted his nails black and wears spikes on his wrist and chains <br/>
around his neck) and Jared made one that meant cow/bull...which he gave to me <br/>
since I&#39;m a Taurus!<br/>
Then Jared pulled out a paper and started copying the symbols in the book <br/>
along with pictures he seemed to be adding from his imagination.<br/>
I was sitting there reflecting on the wonderful day and watching my 9yo son <br/>
that can&#39;t read yet, nor write anything other than his name, copying Japanese <br/>
symbols as though his life depended on it.<br/>
How ironic. My child is practicing writing, he&#39;s practicing reading, but not <br/>
English.<br/>
I could only chuckle and think &quot;only an unschooler&quot;.<br/>
But if the relatives want to know what he&#39;s up to I can say &quot;oh, he&#39;s <br/>
practicing his writing&quot; smugly :)<br/>
<br/>
We also have bonded with a couple of neighbor kids, they moved in about 6 <br/>
months ago but we just met them last month.<br/>
This week they have come over to our house every single day. In fact, when <br/>
they get off the bus from school they come straight to our house (and call <br/>
their Mom to let her know).<br/>
They live only  three doors down. The little girl thinks I&#39;m the bomb because <br/>
I am a make up artist.....that&#39;s right up her fashionable little alley!! <br/>
After I did makeovers on her and Sierra today (in preparation for a tea <br/>
party) she said &quot;I wish I was homeschooled&quot;<br/>
and then &quot;I like it over here, I wish I lived with you&quot;<br/>
Which was really sweet, and a HUGE compliment..but then I worry that they <br/>
will say too many nice things about us and make the parents not want them to <br/>
come over so much! This is the first time the kids have had neighbor friends <br/>
they really enjoy and want to spend time with, so I hope they keep coming <br/>
over....<br/>
<br/>
Ren<br/>
&quot;The world&#39;s much smaller than you think.  Made up of two kinds of <br/>
people--simple and complicated.....The simple ones are contented.  The <br/>
complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
