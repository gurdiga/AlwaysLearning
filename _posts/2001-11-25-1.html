<div id="ygrps-yiv-2115172492">I am not a particularly spiritual person and neither is my husband.  <br/>
It was never our intention to keep religion or spirituality from our son<br/>
and  most of our family members and friends are practicing members of<br/>
some religious organization.  We have always tried to answer his<br/>
questions in a non biased way, ( I hope we succeeded )  and if he had<br/>
specific questions we tried to find answers.  <br/>
I recently found some books on different faiths and they have been<br/>
helpful. <br/>
<br/>
Well, here it is.  My son is becoming a spiritual person.  He recently<br/>
lost both his grandfathers.  He was close to both of them and close to<br/>
their deaths as well as they were in our care at home during their final<br/>
illnesses.   This may have a good deal to do with his pondering&#39;s lately,<br/>
I know.   <br/>
<br/>
 He&#39;s not troubled, only curious.  I know faith is a very personal thing.<br/>
 I know my opinions have an influence on him.  I&#39;m just trying to be a<br/>
source of help and security to him while he finds answers that make sense<br/>
to him, without unduly influencing him to my way of thinking.  This must<br/>
sound extremely naive but not being religious, it really never occurred<br/>
to me he&#39;d have more than passing questions.<br/>

<br>I think its just great Deb. . . and maybe he might be your &quot;teacher&quot; in this. . . follow his lead. . . there are lots of spiritual books that are not religious in tone or nature as well. . . I would be happy to write up a list for you and send it to you. Lelia who is 12, also is very spiritual and refers to lots of books on our shelves for information and spiritual stuff.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2095639863">The older I get, the less interested in spirituality I&#39;ve become. Not sure <br/>
why that is. Maybe it&#39;s a reaction to the prevailing &quot;spirituality&quot; where I <br/>
live (the same city with Bob Jones University). In the last few years I&#39;ve <br/>
felt the most tremendous relief and pleasure in *not* looking for <br/>
spirituality or religion or God. And my youngest child has been around for <br/>
all of these changes in me. So far he seems okay with life as it is without <br/>
looking for something more. If I were to notice his becoming a spiritual <br/>
person like your son is Deb, I would be really unsure how to handle it. I&#39;m <br/>
so skeptical at this point, I&#39;m afraid that would come through in any <br/>
discussion. Using books like you have already and like lovemary suggested <br/>
seems a very good way to go. <br/>

make up his own mind.  <br/>
My son and I are vegan and his father is primarily a vegetarian.  Dylan<br/>
didn&#39;t even know people ate animals until he was four years old.  We were<br/>
visiting cousins who made a big deal out of it and then of course the<br/>
questions came.  Since that time he has remained vegan even though we<br/>
have made it clear to him he can choose differently.  He really loves<br/>
animals and can&#39;t imagine eating one.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to approach the questions about religion in the same way.  <br/>
Maybe, when he gets all the information he wants for now things will<br/>
settle into a kind of digestion stage.  <br/>

&gt; Deb L<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is SOO cool!  I am a Director of Religious Education at a <br/>
Unitarian Universalist church, and I&#39;m currently writing a book about <br/>
spiritual education, kind of from an unschooling perspective. <br/>
<br/>
Generally, I would do a few things. First, when he asks questions, <br/>
ask him what he thinks (not in a way that suggests you&#39;re testing <br/>
him, but let him know you&#39;re curious.) Tell him that a lot of this is <br/>
new to you, and you may not have thought about it, but that you&#39;d <br/>
like to explore together. If you DO have a thought about it, <br/>
certainly share it.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of wonderful books to strew about, about different <br/>
beliefs, people&#39;s ideas about answers to those Big Questions, etc.  I <br/>
would suggest lots of walks in nature.  Maybe quiet times. <br/>
<br/>
I think unschooling really allows both children and adults a real <br/>
opportunity to connect spiritually, and you&#39;re not likely to pass <br/>
down a lot of dogma about what your son HAS to believe. That will <br/>
allow him the freedom to find out for himself what he really DOES <br/>
believe...and see that it may change over time.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Children can be with death much better than adults.  I remember <br/>
when my son Gabriel (22 years ago) died, the kids in his <br/>
Montessori school had wonderful thoughts and questions about <br/>
Gabe&#39;s dying. The adults didn&#39;t like to talk about it and were very <br/>
uncomfortable. Answering your son&#39;s questions, exploring <br/>
together the answers is a very good thing to do. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how old your son is, but you might consider letting <br/>
him attend different church-based youth groups, to see the <br/>
similarities/differences. There are lots out there. <br/>
Just a thought. <br/>

<br>
<br>The church my parents belonged to when I was growing up had a youth group that did a lot of visiting of other churches and other religions -- we did things like walk up the street to the Catholic Church and the priest there talked to us about their beliefs and practices. I also remember we visited a Buddhist center and a Jewish synagogue and lots of other places (I live in a place that has a lot of different religions - so it was reasonable to do this even back then in the late 50&#39;s/early 60&#39;s). &nbsp;This started me on the path of being fascinated by other religions and I continued studying them right on through high school and college and beyond - always taking every opportunity to go with friends to their own places of worship and talk to people and I even took a number of college courses such as &quot;psychology of religion&quot; and &quot;sociology of religion&quot; in addition to survey courses such as &quot;religions of the middle east&quot; and so on, as well as occasionally taking courses offered by the various religions themselves. After years and years of this kind of investigation, I did finally join a religion (I became a member of the Baha&#39;i Faith about 20 years ago) and, interestingly, the same church (a United Methodist Church) that started my early interest has invited me several times to speak about the Baha&#39;i Faith to their youth groups .

purpose of life? What lies beyond? How other cultures view our purpose and<br/>
the beyond? Specifics about other religions?<br/>
<br/>
I think Chinaberry (http://www.chinaberry.com) does spirituality without the<br/>
religion extremely well. They have an awesome selection of books.<br/>
<br/>
As for beliefs, I&#39;d begin with picture books of myths from all times and<br/>
places.<br/>
<br/>
But I think actions say a lot more. For instance, when you encounter<br/>
something that you might be inclined to be disapproving of (cuisine that<br/>
includes insects, the full muslim dress for women, tatoos or whatever) you<br/>
might describe it as interesting or different, and say you wouldn&#39;t choose<br/>
it for yourself but that it&#39;s interesting and perhaps talk about why others<br/>
do.<br/>
<br/>
You could set up a little shrine of precious things: rocks, leaves, army men<br/>
;-) Make it ever changing. They could each have their own or you could do<br/>
one together depending on their personal styles. Then you can (perhaps with<br/>
lighting a candle) each mention something you&#39;re thankful for each day.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One of the sweetest things in my life was when Kirby was five or so and a big <br/>
Ninja Turtles fan.  It was Christmas, and I had our most-of an Italian creche <br/>
scene set up, and the figures being about Ninja Turtle size, they&#39;d be <br/>
borrowed to go on adventures.  The shepherd carrying a lamb on his shoulders <br/>
was a favorite.  But in the place of the missing shepherds or wise men would <br/>
be a Ninja Turtle adoring Jesus.  And it changed.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t spirituality, it was action figures.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve found more spirituality in the course of things than from any one <br/>
specific book.  When kids ask why someone did what they did, why this, why <br/>
that (in Rumplestiltskin, or Sleeping Beauty, or in a movie or in real life) <br/>
we had chances to discuss how people decide what to be like.<br/>
<br/>
Someone in a homeschooling discussion years ago asked how, if we weren&#39;t <br/>
Christian, could I possibly teach my children about morality.  It was a <br/>
fascinating question.  I remember being Christian and having the feeling that <br/>
I was good because I was following the example of Jesus.  Others, without <br/>
that example, must obviously and easily choose the bad over the good, because <br/>
it must obviously be so much easier and more desireable, and that without <br/>
Jesus I would be a murdering, lying, adulteratous, covetous, <br/>
worshipping-other-gods shoplifter.  Why not!?  <br/>
<br/>
Turns out it was the Christians who were having a hard time teaching <br/>
morality.  They simplified it, as it had been for me, to the point that there <br/>
was NO reason to be good whatsoever except for the fear of punishment (from <br/>
God or God&#39;s representatives, the parents, directly on behalf of God).  So <br/>
sure enough, some of those kids longed to leave home and get drunk and break <br/>
stuff and say bad words and be rude.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve bought some books from Chinaberry about God and spiritual matters, and <br/>
we have the Dorling Kindersley and Usborne books on comparative religion <br/>
(which I love to read from to the kids or to myself, and which we use for <br/>
reference when someone&#39;s religious holidays or cultural restrictions comes <br/>
up).<br/>
<br/>
The concepts of respect, compassion and gratitude, though, are dealt with in <br/>
English, without juju, without threat of deitary disapproval.  It&#39;s &quot;the <br/>
Golden Rule&quot; in 45 words or more--not a platitude, but a reminder of their <br/>
care of themselves and their friends and family with a sweet attitude.  The <br/>
idea that if they somehow make a situation worse, they&#39;ve screwed up and need <br/>
to take out their handy, ready tools to make it better.<br/>
<br/>
Oh!  A good place to start with little children and spirituality would be the <br/>
collection of &quot;Do unto others&quot; from various religious writings which has been <br/>
collected up for several years.  I&#39;ll look for it.  It&#39;s a wonderful intro to <br/>
comparative religion without needing any knowledge of history or geography.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-219200343">Thanks, Joyce--I like the shrine idea (although at their age, I can <br/>
imagine my boys perhaps having more fun knocking all the treasures on <br/>
the ground than contemplating their beauty or meaning!  :-D  ).  I <br/>
also like the idea of talking about things you&#39;re thankful for each <br/>
day (good advice for adults, too).<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m most interested in picture books of multicultural myths--<br/>
do you or does anyone else have suggestions?  I&#39;m surprised at how <br/>
hard it is to find books like this (that aren&#39;t solely Christian-<br/>
oriented).  Also, I just placed an order for some Chinaberry books--<br/>
you&#39;re right, it&#39;s a wonderful catalog.<br/>
<br/>
I think spirituality for me has to do mostly with a sense of <br/>
connectedness with all beings and things (can you tell I&#39;m still <br/>
working on this for myself?!).  I just would like to give my guys the <br/>
idea that there&#39;s something else besides the material world (which <br/>
they probably would realize by themselves even if I did nothing).  Or <br/>
else give them a springboard for conversation/contemplation...This is <br/>
tough when you&#39;re not part of an organized religion.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for your help and suggestions!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-8933030">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I guess I&#39;m most interested in picture books of<br/>
multicultural myths--<br/>
do you or does anyone else have suggestions?  I&#39;m<br/>
surprised at how <br/>
hard it is to find books like this (that aren&#39;t solely<br/>
Christian-<br/>
oriented).  Also, I just placed an order for some<br/>
Chinaberry books--<br/>
you&#39;re right, it&#39;s a wonderful catalog.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
These are some books that we have loved:<br/>
Premalata and the Festival of Lights (about Diwali)<br/>
The Mountains of Tibet (about reincarnation)<br/>
A World of Faith (general book about various<br/>
religions).<br/>
I think most or all of these could be found at<br/>
Chinaberry.<br/>
<br/>
