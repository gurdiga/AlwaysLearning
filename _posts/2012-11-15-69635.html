<div id="ygrps-yiv-1852777592">Here is a growing list of experiences and volunteer jobs offered for unschooled teens and young adults.  Some of you might have or know older unschoolers who might want to travel and visit, and do some work that could go on a resume.  They&#39;re not &quot;jobs&quot; in the making money way, but they&#39;re ways to get experience for applying for other jobs later.  And they&#39;re opportunities to live other places for a while.<br/>
<br/>
Some of you might have projects or situations you want to add to that data base, too, to host an unschooler.  Those who live far from other families might want to borrow an experienced unschooler for a while. :-)<br/>
