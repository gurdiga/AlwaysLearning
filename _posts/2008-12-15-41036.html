<div id="ygrps-yiv-410134311">From another thread, I&#39;ve brought something for a new thread:<br/>
<br/>
-=-Having fun, exploring our physicality through sport and other  <br/>
activities is part of being human. To deny these things is to work  <br/>
against our own nature.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe.  Maybe not.   It must be human nature to throw and kick things  <br/>
and to compete, but those urges can be satisfied by hunting and by  <br/>
taming animals.<br/>
<br/>
-=-There is a theory that many of the world&#39;s current woes can be  <br/>
traced to the split between body and spirit found in monotheistic  <br/>
religions. Denying our bodily urges, pleasures and needs divorces us  <br/>
from the natural world, hence the exploitation of animals, of the  <br/>
earth, global warming ... -=-<br/>
<br/>
If I squint I can see a little of it, but whether the basis of a  <br/>
culture&#39;s religion is based on worshiping trees or rocks or  <br/>
waterfalls, or the sun and the moon and weather, they still ended up  <br/>
through human nature creating tools and mining metals and creating  <br/>
vehicles (animal powered or otherwise), and those are parts of human  <br/>
nature too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My monotheistic religion (though I dislike using that word to <br/>
describe my beliefs) absolutely is in tune with human nature and the <br/>
earth.  God created my body to give birth and to do that most <br/>
effectively in the peace and safety of my own home.  He made my <br/>
breasts to nourish my children and my hips to carry them and my body <br/>
to keep them warm at night.  He gave me mothering instincts, filled <br/>
my heart with love for my children, and told me to love them as I <br/>
love myself.  He gave us this earth to discover and use and enjoy, <br/>
but also to care for and be responsible with.  He created human <br/>
nature and part of that is having fun and being goofy.  My beliefs <br/>
even led me to unschooling.      <br/>
<br/>
And to the shock of many Christians- God created the ability to <br/>
orgasm!</div>
