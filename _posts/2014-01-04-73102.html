<div id="ygrps-yiv-2022985420"><p dir="ltr">I sucked my thumb until I was 9. I needed braces at 13. My parents tried everything to make me stop. Nothing worked. I do have some negative feelings in the memories but not devastating ones- I really loved my thumb. I remember my dad telling me my breath stank. I don&#39;t remember doing anything about it.  Maybe you could encourage more hand washing and tooth brushing?  I was certainly old enough to understand hygiene and bad smells. </p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1013025606">Sometimes well intentioned people-- dentists, self-appointed experts, family members, and even strangers-- seem to delight in pointing out areas in which our children are not &quot;normal.&quot; Then they enjoy giving unsolicited advice as to how to &quot;fix&quot; our children.  For me-- a recovering people pleaser-- this can be hard to bear.<br/>
<br/>
Please don&#39;t worry about your daughter&#39;s thumb sucking.  There are MANY worse ways to self soothe.  Children eventually outgrow the need for it-- at least I don&#39;t know of any adult thumb suckers-- and when they do, we parents can consider braces. <br/>
<br/>
My oldest son is thirteen.  He is bright, outgoing, and happy.  Unlike his younger brothers, however, he has always loved to suck his thumb.  He began sucking his thumb in utero; and like your daughter, it is a source of great comfort to him.  He rarely sucks his thumb in public.  None of his friends know of this habit.  However, when he is sleepy, he still sucks his thumb.  And yes, he needs braces.<br/>
<br/>
In the last year, he told me he would like to stop thumb sucking.  I asked if he would like me to gently bring it to his attention whenever I noticed him doing it.  He said yes.  So now whenever I see him sucking his thumb (usually only on a long car ride when he is getting tired or late at night when he is curled up on the couch watching a movie) I will quietly smile and say, &quot;Thumb.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s important not to shame our children or suggest that they are failures or babies for continuing this habit.  Although it may affect the teeth, the teeth can be fixed.  As you suggested, your child&#39;s trust in your love and support is far more important.     <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-705932962"><p dir="ltr">I was a thumb sucker as a child,  and my mom put anything from chicken poop to hot sauce. She wrapped it up in tape, I mean the only thing that she didn&#39;t do was chop it off. Still today, after a marriage and two children,  there are times when I still want to suck on my thumb to be quite honest. I think that if she has that need, you should just let her. It will stop when she is ready for it to stop.<br>

Last Summer I went to a festival in which I met a chiropractor. During his session,  he explained the importance that thumb suction has in development. I was stunned! <br>
It turns out that by sucking the thumb the muscles of the back of the neck get to fully develop, and that is something important for the human body. He actually had all 35 people sucking our thumbs by the end of the session!<br>

I made the mistake of making my daughter stop. Knowing what I know now, I much rather know that her neck got fully developed. So if your daughter has that need, and she know what she  needs, let her. If her breath isn&#39;t pleasant,  talk to her about hygiene,  and as far as the teeth, braces can fix that. Another thing could be that you offer her Popsicles, lollipops, ice cream,  and other things that can satisfy that need, without making it a big deal. Explain to her about the sugar content of those foods and let her know that brushing her teeth after will help her teeth stay healthy.<br>

Sometimes,  getting caught up in cosmetics,  we miss the big picture,  but the teeth are just cosmetics and it can be fixed at the right time.</p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1877264021"><p>I sucked my thumb until I was ten. We weren&#39;t unschooling, but I remember deciding to stop and that it took some time and effort on my part to break the habit. My teeth weren&#39;t adversely affected. I decided to stop because little kids suck their thumbs and I was ready to put little kid things behind me. At the same time, I dropped my childhood nickname and insisted on using my real, much more grown-up sounding name.</p><p><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">My sinuses were chronically congested as a child after I stopped sucking my thumb. As an adult, taking yoga classes, I found that if I pressed my tongue against the roof of my mouth my sinuses cleared, so I wonder if thumb sucking was related to that in some way - something about the pressure or the way body parts align helps clear the sinuses. Bad breath can be a result of post nasal drip, so if your daughter is chronically congested it could lead to both bad breath And thumb sucking, if the thumb sucking helps clear her nasal passages.&nbsp;</p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">---Meredith</p></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-998065647"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;My concern is that her breath is atrocious&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She has bad breath.  See if she would like a mouthwash.  My son likes Listerine - likes the fresh feeling he gets after he rinses his mouth with it.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and her front teeth are really protruding.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have protruding teeth.  I&#39;ve grown to like them, despite my dad always wanting to fix them (well into my 20s).  In fact, I think they make my smile uniquely mine.  Maybe she will like the way her teeth look.  Don&#39;t try to fix or suggest fixing something that isn&#39;t broken to her.  Let her come to her own conclusions about how she feels about the way her body looks and operates.   <br/>
<br/>
Our dentist has asked numerous times if we were considering an orthodontist for Ethan.  I always say no.  This past time I politely asked her not to ask me that any more.  I said that if he wants work done on his teeth, that will be his choice.  I think his smile is beautiful, and he has no trouble eating.  He has never spoken of being unhappy with his teeth, so I want to let it be.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;m looking for.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Think about what you *are* looking for.  When you are more clear about that, answers to your questions will be clearer and might come easier too.<br/>

      <p></p><p dir="ltr">I was a thumb sucker as a child,&nbsp; and my mom put anything from chicken poop to hot sauce. She wrapped it up in tape, I mean the only thing that she didn&#39;t do was chop it off. Still today, after a marriage and two children,&nbsp; there are times when I still want to suck on my thumb to be quite honest. I think that if she has that need, you should just let her. It will stop when she is ready for it to stop.<br>

Last Summer I went to a festival in which I met a chiropractor. During his session,&nbsp; he explained the importance that thumb suction has in development. I was stunned! <br>
It turns out that by sucking the thumb the muscles of the back of the neck get to fully develop, and that is something important for the human body. He actually had all 35 people sucking our thumbs by the end of the session!<br>

I made the mistake of making my daughter stop. Knowing what I know now, I much rather know that her neck got fully developed. So if your daughter has that need, and she know what she&nbsp; needs, let her. If her breath isn&#39;t pleasant,&nbsp; talk to her about hygiene,&nbsp; and as far as the teeth, braces can fix that. Another thing could be that you offer her Popsicles, lollipops, ice cream,&nbsp; and other things that can satisfy that need, without making it a big deal. Explain to her about the sugar content of those foods and let her know that brushing her teeth after will help her teeth stay healthy.<br>

Sometimes,&nbsp; getting caught up in cosmetics,&nbsp; we miss the big picture,&nbsp; but the teeth are just cosmetics and it can be fixed at the right time.</p>

      <p></p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top">My daughter is nine years old and sucks her thumb.  She was adopted at almost two years old and has always sucked her thumb for comfort.  It is her way to self-soothe.  My husband and I started trying to get her to stop a few years ago prior to unschooling.  We have been unschooling for about a year now.  When we were able to get her to stop through coercion and other not so pretty ways, she started heavily masturbating.  Clearly she needs an outlet.  <br>
<br>I have given up trying to get her to quit because through unschooling I now realize that I would rather have a good relationship with her than see her stop.  My concern is that her breath is atrocious and her front teeth are really protruding.  We have not taken her to an orthodontist yet.  I think she is still too young.  Any thoughts?  I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;m looking for.  Maybe someone who has had a thumb sucker and some ideas
 as to what they did or did not do.  <br><br>Sherry<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://overview.mail.yahoo.com?.src=iOS"><br><br>Sent from Yahoo Mail for iPad</a></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1750172867"><p dir="ltr">Even though I quit at 9. I chewed my nails very low until a year and a half ago (I&#39;m 45!). Now people compliment my nails all the time!  I never thought that would happen but it did. </p>
<p dir="ltr">One other thing.  Two of my 3 kids sucked their thumbs. I never said anything negative about it.  I understood.  When each of them was five I asked them if they wanted an I Quit Sucking My Thumb Party. No presents but in every other way like a big birthday party.  Lots of friends,  food, games,  prizes, etc. They both loved the idea and succeeded.  Many years later my daughter told me that for a little while after she would cheat and hide and suck her thumb once in a while. I&#39;m not sure how I feel about her feeling like she had to hide it from me but she doesn&#39;t seem bothered by it and I guess I&#39;m glad she told me eventually. </p>
