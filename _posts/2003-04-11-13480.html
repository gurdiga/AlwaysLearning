<div id="ygrps-yiv-1130819327">I woke up to Kirby coming quietly into my room saying, &quot;You&#39;re still asleep!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It was five til 10:00 when he was supposed to be at the driver&#39;s ed school to <br/>
drive with the instructor for the second time.  I just jumped into jeans and <br/>
stumbled out.  He said &quot;Maybe you should walk around a bit to wake up.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad he was up and ready and thinking about that!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t usually sleep that late but I had a night of weird dreams, which <br/>
isn&#39;t common for me.<br/>
<br/>
Holly and I went to take down some posters about her friend&#39;s missing dog, <br/>
which was found because of the posters!<br/>
<br/>
When we got back, Marty was playing the Beatles, on the turntable.  A Hard <br/>
Day&#39;s Night, and singing, and rearranging gaming stuff (I would say &quot;cleaning <br/>
up,&quot; but I didn&#39;t actually go look, so maybe he was just making room for more <br/>
playing).<br/>
<br/>
He came downstairs to get something and I told him that album he was <br/>
listening to was the British Hard Day&#39;s Night, not the American version.  I <br/>
said it didn&#39;t matter much, but just in case he was ever on Jeopardy and they <br/>
asked a question about whether a song was on A Hard Day&#39;s Night, he needed to <br/>
know there were more songs on the English version than the American.   He <br/>
nodded and said &quot;Okay.&quot;  Just as though it had been important. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A little bit later I heard him call out through the house, &quot;Holly!  Why don&#39;t <br/>
you come play me at Harry Potter?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Cool.<br/>
<br/>
Now his friend Brett&#39;s here, and Sadie is on her way.  They&#39;re both <br/>
unschoolers.  Ryan (grown, works at Active Imagination) just called.  Maybe <br/>
he&#39;s coming over too, I don&#39;t know.  Kirby&#39;s at work.  Jeremy&#39;s coming later. <br/>
 Then he and Sadie are going to Espanola (hometown of Sadie, and of me) to <br/>
see Godspell which is being put on by the little college uour checklist.  <br/>
Driving through Santa Fe&#39;s not too hard if we just stay on St. Francis Drive.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s shaping up to be a happy and leisurely weekend.<br/>
