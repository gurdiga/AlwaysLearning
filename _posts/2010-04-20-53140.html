<div id="ygrps-yiv-393399794">Katy (11) and I have been unschooling since September so we are rather new to it and I am still de-schooling (Katy, of course figured it out real fast). Katy loves Tranformers and spends a lot of time playing with them, watching Transformers programs and toy reviews on the computer and, lately, making her own toy reviews and skits on Youtube with her video camera. I know that her interest in the toys has fueled her ability to navigate the internet for interesting sites and the reviews she&#39;s been watching and making help her understand the concept of a report or evaluation of a product. I am a doll collector so I can identify with her collecting passion, but I never played with Transformers much and never watched the program before (she&#39;s my only child). I could use a bit of a kick start to my thinking about what skills, interests, activities a passion for Transformers might lead to or extend into so that I can stretch my own mind about this passion of hers and maybe bring in some related interests that neither of us have thought about.</div>

Howard Gardner&#39;s work involves sorting out different aspects of  <br/>
intelligence.  Collecting, comparisons, learning the minutest details  <br/>
of things is &quot;Nature Intelligence.&quot;  It doesn&#39;t have to be trees or  <br/>
birds or rocks.  It can be automobiles, clothing design, or pottery.   <br/>
Sorting through similarities and differences is an intelligence some  <br/>
people have and some people have not-so-much.<br/>

<br/>
Is she interested in the physical transformation of the toys?  If so,  <br/>
maybe 3-D puzzles, or even jigsaw puzzles.  Maybe you could find a  <br/>
jigsaw puzzle with a transformers picture.<br/>
<br/>
Working a puzzle with another person is one of the greatest ways to  <br/>
talk.<br/>

If she&#39;s more interested in the stories, are there Japanese videos  <br/>
or ...<br/>
<br/>
I stopped there and went and talked to Marty about this.  He said  <br/>
&quot;Engineering!&quot;  He asked what I had already written, and thinks I  <br/>
should add for him that if you can manage to get a Japanese  <br/>
transformer toy that they&#39;re way more interesting than the American  <br/>
versions.<br/>

the kid learns that his/her interests matter and are important and <br/>
worthwhile. And that the parents can be counted upon to support them.<br/>

Thanks!</div>

 </span></blockquote>Every time I touch a Transformer toy I am amazed at the engineering that<br/>
goes into each one of them. My husband gave the boys several from his own<br/>
childhood and they are really amazing...made mostly of metal. The newer ones<br/>
are mostly plastic. All of them are intriguing!<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, try to transform one of them. Look at how all the little<br/>
intricate pieces MUST fit together in one specific way to make it work. Look<br/>
at how the designer had to make a head (for example) just generic enough<br/>
that once transformed it could look like a headlight, or grill ornament.<br/>
<br/>
Transformer play around here has always led to this type of chatter.<br/>
<br/>
My eldest loves to make his own transformers out of legos, fully articulated<br/>
and able to do those amazing maneuvers.<br/>
<br/>
Both boys have said they want to become toy designers when they grow up<br/>
because of these.<br/>
