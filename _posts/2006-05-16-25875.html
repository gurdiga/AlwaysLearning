I&#39;m reading (listening via mp3 player, actually) to an old Robert Heinlein novel, &quot;Have Space Suit, Will Travel&quot;.  The main characters are a teen boy and a pre-teen girl.<br/>
<br/>
Not that this book will help someone become an astronaut, but may be of interest to them.<br/>

That organization has a really interesting history.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The problem with a very specific plan like &quot;become an astronaut&quot; is  <br/>
that the odds of failure rise hugely.<br/>
<br/>
If someone wants to be president or a professional basketball player  <br/>
(substitute the regional political and professional-athletic  <br/>
equivalents where applicable), and nothing else, a lifetime of  <br/>
perceived failure can arrive.<br/>
<br/>
If someone&#39;s goal can be recast as &quot;learn about flight&quot; or &quot;become  <br/>
involved in local politics&quot; or &quot;play basketball as much as possible,&quot;  <br/>
then success can nearly be assured.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not discouraging for a child if you help them look into their  <br/>
interests, but I think (and have some experience with others&#39;  <br/>
frustrations and longterm disappointments) if you treat it like a  <br/>
goal that CAN be reached if only the kid does the right things,  <br/>
that&#39;s helping set up for a possible failure.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/president">http://sandradodd.com/president</a><br/>
<br/>
In an unschooling article someone linked on another list (or maybe  <br/>
here, I don&#39;t know, it gets all a-swirl), a girl being interviewed  <br/>
said &quot;I can become president.&quot;   (Or maybe &quot;I could,&quot; but still...)<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, SOMEONE will be president at any given moment, but not even all  <br/>
of those who are likely millionaire candidates will become  <br/>
president.  Fewer than half of those who actually RUN become  <br/>
president. &lt;g&gt;  And I think of those who did become president, few  <br/>
grew up intending to do so.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Keith too, after he was grown especially.  He hoped the program would  <br/>
be big enough that he&#39;d become a specialist in something they really  <br/>
needed fixed or maintained in person. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When I was little I wanted to go into space.  I read lots about it,  <br/>
and then it passed in favor of wanting to become a teacher, or a  <br/>
missionary, or a writer.   The last three urges have been satisfied  <br/>
in one way or another.<br/>
<br/>
I think there are ways to encourage interests without funneling a kid  <br/>
toward a single point.  Balancing information with parallel, related  <br/>
fields she might not have considered might be one way.  Marty has  <br/>
considered police work, and is always aware of it out of the corner  <br/>
of his eye.  I don&#39;t discourage him at all (though Keith wishes I  <br/>
would) but when things come up, that interest is a factor. Hard to  <br/>
explain.  When he was talking about maybe going to the university for  <br/>
a while, but still applying to the police academy when he&#39;s 21, we  <br/>
talked about what kinds of things might be helpful to take in two or  <br/>
three years even without a degree.  We talked about chemistry and  <br/>
physics, if he was interested in forensics; about sports and P.E.  <br/>
just for general strength and stamina, to know more about how not to  <br/>
get hurt being physical, and in case he wanted to be involved in the  <br/>
Police Athletic League.  But I&#39;ve kept the big door open to the  <br/>
possibility that he&#39;ll do something altogether different that he  <br/>
hasn&#39;t even considered  yet.  And he has noticed that the police cars  <br/>
are parked in neighborhoods where the houses aren&#39;t very expensive  <br/>
(city police take their cars home with them at night here), so they  <br/>
apparently don&#39;t make much money.   But those factors are neither  <br/>
&quot;deciders&quot; nor paths he would have to back out of.  He wouldn&#39;t be  <br/>
wasting time or going down the wrong track or failing.<br/>
<br/>
In the article about becoming president, there&#39;s this: &quot;So what IS a  <br/>
worthy goal for us to set for our children? I heard about a family  <br/>
with a chart on the wall culminating in a scholarship to Notre Dame.  <br/>
It worked backwards into the present, so that if the child met all  <br/>
the lower-level goals, the scholarship was a done deal. The kid was  <br/>
only nine years old or so, and the parents had made the chart  <br/>
themselves, but hey! People need GOALS!! (In our collective defense,  <br/>
these people weren�t homeschooling.) What are their odds of failure?  <br/>
A scholarship to Harvard would be a failure.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And years back, when the AOL homeschooling forum was wildly active,  <br/>
someone told a similar story, of a timeline in a child&#39;s room that  <br/>
went along two walls, and was a set of goals for a sport.  I think it  <br/>
was swimming, but it could&#39;ve been gymnastics (Nancy do you remember  <br/>
this story?) and it had the dates by which she needed to win regional  <br/>
and state and national titles to go to the olympics or some such.   <br/>
The kid was youngish.  I really wish I had kept it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1407580501">I think there&#39;s isn&#39;t just ONE way, but many ways you can be an <br/>
astronaut. Being very good at one thing that is space related is one <br/>
way - not every astronaut needs to be a pilot anymore.  Get her <br/>
books on other astronauts and how they have succeeded, especially <br/>
Sally Ride.  She was never in the military, nor was she a pilot:<br/>

<br/>
But she was in good, physical condition, smart and had a techical <br/>
degree (Physics) as well as non-tech (English) which may have help <br/>
her be selected as more well rounded (I don&#39;t know, just a guess.)<br/>

I think you should fully help your daughter and support her in her <br/>
dreams.  They may change, but believing in her and supporting her <br/>
won&#39;t change.  And in learning all you can about astronauts, she <br/>
might find something else that is interesting, astrophysics, <br/>
engineering, flight, on and on! :) What &#39;isn&#39;t&#39; part of space! :)<br/>
<br/>
My 6 year old wanted to be an astronaut, pizza maker and rock star, <br/>
all three, and of course those careers are completely compatible, so <br/>
we talked about how he could work as a pizza maker in his teens and <br/>
do his music at the same time he&#39;s learning about space.  But then 6 <br/>
months later he said he didn&#39;t think he wanted to be an <br/>
astronaut. :)  And now that his 14 year old brother has a band, he&#39;s <br/>
learning of the hard work it takes to be a musician and that it <br/>
doesn&#39;t just come natually.  :) We still make pizzas here, but he <br/>
might be reconsidering that as well. :)<br/>
<br/>
I think part of finding out who you are is the putting on of a job <br/>
like a suit of clothes and finding out if it fits. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1187911989">My older son is now 14 and when he was 7 was ready to join the CAP.  <br/>
Well, he did grow up to be 12 and join the CAP and he did awesome!<br/>
<br/>
He excelled in every area and rose in rank. He did this weekly for <br/>
almost two years. Then he was done.<br/>
<br/>
As a mom, I gave an internal sigh of relief since I would worry had <br/>
he joined the real military simply because of the danger, but I <br/>
would fully support his decision there, just as we did this.<br/>
<br/>
Again, I think he was trying this on and while he liked it for a <br/>
while (even considering going to a military high school), I think <br/>
once he succeeded, he had answered whatever he was trying to ask to <br/>
himself and has moved on to other things.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, yes, also he wanted to grow his hair long and that is <br/>
imcompatible with being in the CAP. :)  He was pushing the limit for <br/>
the last month or so, but now, it&#39;s a band and long hair. :)<br/>

started saying this about 4 years ago. So, when she&#39;s asked about it,  <br/>
or when it comes up, I&#39;ve said, &quot;Right now Rosie&#39;s thinking that  <br/>
being a librarian sounds great,&quot; or &quot;Librarian is at the top of the  <br/>
list, right now.&quot; She ALSO is interested in engineering - and she&#39;s  <br/>
especially interested in traffic (gee, Southern California girl &lt;G&gt;).  <br/>
She wants to understand how the traffic engineers decide things like:  <br/>
How many lanes and how wide the lanes should be on freeways; how long  <br/>
the red and green lights should be, when to put a stop sign up and  <br/>
when to make it four-way versus two-way, when to put a signal instead  <br/>
of a stop sign, and on and on.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t necessarily expect that she&#39;ll end up as either a librarian  <br/>
OR as an engineer, but I keep those interests in mind and helped her  <br/>
think of library-related activities when she was trying to figure out  <br/>
what to do for a Girl Scout project and took her to an engineering  <br/>
open house at a local university and so on.<br/>
<br/>
I never say, &quot;Rosie is going to be a librarian,&quot; or even &quot;Rosie plans  <br/>
to be a librarian,&quot; though. I don&#39;t want her to feel embarrassed or  <br/>
weird about changing her mind.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s worked at the library once a week for almost two years - still  <br/>
really likes it and is their favorite volunteer and now gets all  <br/>
their &quot;special projects&quot; to do. So she&#39;s getting a really good  <br/>
insight into the inner workings of libraries.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t really come up with a way for her to learn more about  <br/>
traffic - other than a lot of conversation as we spend a lot of time  <br/>
IN traffic every day!<br/>

this.  <br/>

She took a book out about Sally Ride from the library and everytime <br/>

interested in the people who discovered things about space. Her main <br/>
interest right now is Galileo. She tells me facts about him all the <br/>

I&#39;ve learned quite a bit from her, never having had an interest in <br/>

There&#39;s a military high school in Roswell, and few of the boys who  <br/>
are there wanted to be there.  Many are put in against their will as  <br/>
a punishment because they got in trouble at school or at home.<br/>
<br/>
How cool for someone to just kinda WANT to be there, and then to  <br/>
think it through and to decide not to go.  Freedom in all directions.<br/>
<br/>
True about Sally Ride, but she wasn&#39;t training to be an astronaut.<br/>
And in the future there should be less demand for all the strenuous  <br/>
physical tests, if space flight becomes in any degree more common.<br/>
<br/>
So ANYthing could be preparation for going into space.<br/>

In 1960 if someone had said &quot;What do I need to do to grow up to use a  <br/>

lives, and one piece of trivia he really knows is how the traffic  <br/>
signals are set up.  He would make a great cab driver.<br/>
<br/>
So when I&#39;m going to go somewhere, if it&#39;s a really busy time, he&#39;ll  <br/>
recommend a route that will get me there fastest.  He knows which  <br/>
streets have timed lights, and how fast to go to catch them (which is  <br/>
sometimes—not always—slower than the speed limit).  I&#39;m lucky to  <br/>
remember whether there&#39;s a light or not.  I&#39;ll sit at a four way stop  <br/>
waiting.  I&#39;m as awkward in that area as Keith is facile.  He loves  <br/>
the big, changing-lights pattern of it all.<br/>
<br/>
I have been told that in Albuquerque if there are three accidents or  <br/>
one fatal accidents at an intersection, that intersection goes next  <br/>
in line to get a light.  Kind of a triage of accident sites.<br/>
<br/>
In England there&#39;s a mark they put where there are accidents.   <br/>
Someone remind me what, please.  A black something.  There&#39;s a  <br/>
symbol.  We could use that here.    It&#39;s not a black hole or a black  <br/>
spot.  Black something, though.<br/>

Really.  Once you throw the ideas out there, they belong to the  <br/>
readers.  If you get benefit from the responses, great!  If you  <br/>
don&#39;t, no big deal.<br/>

Joyce wrote this wise thing about that concept:<br/>
<br/>
=============================<br/>
<br/>
The list is about ideas, not about people.<br/>
<br/>
Think of ideas like balls and the list like a ball court. If someone  <br/>
tosses an idea worth discussing into the court it&#39;s going to get  <br/>
batted about. At that point what&#39;s going on is no longer about the  <br/>
person who tossed the idea in. It&#39;s about the idea and how well and  <br/>
cleanly it&#39;s being tossed about. (Unless the tosser keeps jumping in  <br/>
and grabbing the idea ball saying &quot;Mine!&quot;)<br/>

I don&#39;t consider it to be a quote, or even about a particular poster unless the quote is attributed.<br/>
<br/>
If I said so and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:so@...">so@...</a> said &quot;this&quot;, then I&#39;m quoting a person.<br/>
<br/>
If I am just expounding on a few words in someone&#39;s post without the detail of who wrote it, my intention is to focus on the idea, not the person.<br/>

I don&#39;t know where you live, but this is cool and there might be <br/>
something similar for your area.<br/>
<br/>
I get it!  Library and Traffic sound awesome to me! :)  I had those <br/>
interests when I was young too.  Traffic is still intersting to <br/>

I love this! :)  You don&#39;t even need to grow up to do a lot of <br/>
things!  When I hear kids talking about being a writer, I say, <br/>
write!  Submit!  No one will know your age unless you tell them! :)<br/>
<br/>
There was a great story I read one time about a kid that was <br/>
extremely intelligent and while he was lonely in his day to day <br/>
life, he lived intellectually through the mail (this was before <br/>
computers) He played chess by mail, wrote articles and made an <br/>
income that his parents never knew about...  My secret dream as <br/>
kid! :) I wish I could go back and tell myself!<br/>
<br/>
But just in case, I still have my slide rule!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And just as with &quot;might want to be a librarian&quot;—if that is tweaked to  <br/>
&quot;work in a library,&quot; a couple of things happen.  Rosie&#39;s already done  <br/>
that. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
And there are many adults who make their living in libraries who  <br/>
aren&#39;t technically librarians.<br/>
Then there are librarians who make little to no money.   And there  <br/>
are unexpected kinds of &quot;real librarians&quot;—at hospitals, and  <br/>
departments of universities or specialty libraries (engineering,  <br/>
medicine), and at engineering firms (Honeywell, where Keith works,  <br/>
has a library).<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the library urge might be satisfied by working in a book  <br/>
store (new or used or special orders).<br/>
<br/>
So if one of my kids said &quot;Seems like being a librarian would be  <br/>
fun,&quot; I&#39;d probably suggest those other kinds of things—try to let  <br/>
them see the range of book-sorting-and-maintenance-related pursuits.<br/>
