<br/>
Ayshah (4) loves to be naked. Thats fine with me but I have informed her its not cool to be at the window naked or answering the door naked.<br/>
<br/>
A few days ago I heard her say to Maryam (2) look at my bum. I then went in and said &quot;no Ayshah, you dont ask Maryam to look at your private area&quot; then today Ayshah said &quot;mum I didnt ask Maryam to look at my private just now&quot; pointing down there. I sternly said &quot; Ayshah I told you not to do that&quot; and asked her to put on pants. <br/>
<br/>
I feel like I have to protect Maryam. Is it normal for siblings to do this? Do you have any thoughts on how I handled the situation?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1467338200">When Marty was little, like three years old, four, sometimes he would stand watching TV and end up holding and pulling his little baby penis.  I asked him not to do that where anyone else was, that some things should only be done when you&#39;re all alone.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to stay away from &quot;never&quot; or &quot;put on some pants&quot; because pants aren&#39;t magic.  The reasons for the requests are more important than making rules about it, but I do think to point out that there are laws.  Big details aren&#39;t necessary, but you might make them laugh (in a good, thought-solidifying way) if you said <br/>
**What if I walked outside naked?  What if I said to the neighbor,  &quot;Look at my bum!&quot;  They would call the police!!&quot;  And just leave it at that for a while.<br/>

They can think about the cultural expectations and traditions without being afraid or ashamed, if you&#39;re careful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-418077757">In observing my own daughters (currently 6 & 4) I notice they innocently compare their crotches about as often as they compare their hair or height.  Though I find it disconcerting I figure the less I fixate on any one thing they do the less they fixate on it, as well, and that has been true for the most part.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s part of our makeup to compare ourselves to others and to be curious about our own bodies and others&#39;.  I don&#39;t think that should be discouraged as long as the children are respectful with each other.<br/>
<br/>
Like Sandra I did make a point of asking them to be curious about their own bodies in the privacy of their own room, explaining that it&#39;s a private activity.  We&#39;ve had interesting discussions about why grown-ups don&#39;t walk around naked all the time and come up with some pretty good reasons!<br/>
<br/>
Bum-looking goes hand-in-hand with poop jokes.  The more I ignore them the less likely I am to have to hear one and the more likely the girls are to move on to something else I will participate in.<br/>
<br/>
Apologies in advance if any of this doesn&#39;t fit with the unschooling school of thought here.<br/>
<br/>
Aloha,<br/>

I wouldn&#39;t recommend that two kids go private with mutual exploration.<br/>
<br/>
The situation was Marty pulling on the foreskin of his penis, stretching it out, without really thinking about what he was doing.  I told him it was okay to touch it, but not in front of other people.  So that would also have been a stricture against doing it in the privacy of &quot;their&quot; (plural their--the kids all shared a room in those days) own room if Kirby was there, or Holly.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-473940974">I think it is all this exploration is fine. Our bodies are funny looking! Why not check each other out and show off their butts? They&#39;re squishy and it&#39;s where poop comes out. What could be funnier than that?! Why have to go behind closed doors in your own house? And especially with siblings, what&#39;s the issue? I think it&#39;s adults&#39; fears that bring on unneccesary shameful feelings. In my experience of community living with young children, little boys are always pulling on their penises when they&#39;re naked. It&#39;s often the closest thing to keep their hands occupied! I say just laugh and enjoy their innocence.Â Anyway, it passes and soon enough they pick up on our culture&#39;s intolerance for nudity. (And of course I believe if you are around strangers and/or in public you need to be more cautious about what is socially acceptable with your children and to teach them these norms.)<br/>
<br/>
I guess I do have a line when it&#39;s more obviously masturbation. I remember once that my daughter (who was maybe 6 or 7) was touching herself on the couch (I can&#39;t remember if she had pants on or not - but it didn&#39;t matter) and I told her that&#39;s something to do in private. She got it. And I believe that because I neverd shamed her she is very open with me (she&#39;s 12) about things going on with her body, puberty, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts,<br/>
