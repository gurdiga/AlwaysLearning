<div id="ygrps-yiv-1683775993">..only if I don&#39;t show up.<br/>
I&#39;ve long brown hair, stand 5&#39;10&quot;, and am a gorgeous 230#&#39;s.<br/>
So, are all unschoolers tall, voluptuous and have long hair?<br/>
HeidiWD<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Nope! ;o) I am 5&#39;2&quot; and just had my hair cut to shoulder length...<br/>
<br/>

-----------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
This is so fun!  Although I am mostly a lurker  (Hi, Stephanie E!) I do <br/>
like to actually join in now and then!<br/>
<br/>
So, not all of us are tall.  I am 5&#39;6&quot;, my scale reads 230+#! and my <br/>
hair, which was once long, is now too short.  Sigh.<br/>
<br/>
  I feel such gratitude for being part of this group, everyone is so <br/>
wonderful!  I have enjoyed the discussion brought up by the anti-child <br/>
humor.  All the thoughts and ideas mentioned are very helpful.  Being <br/>
the parent, I think, is a bit different from being a friend, but <br/>
hopefully one is a friend as well.<br/>
<br/>
On that subject, I need help/advice/suggestions for a few &#39;situations&#39; <br/>
that are going on in our house.<br/>
<br/>
--  I have 2 boys, Ethan is 5 and Cyrus is 9.  They fight CONSTANTLY!  <br/>
This has been going on for many, many months now and I lost my patience <br/>
long ago.<br/>
<br/>
-- Additionally, Cyrus constantly challenges me.  If I ask him to pick <br/>
up toys or help with dishes, or anything else, his first response is <br/>
NO!  Then he says he is the only one in our house who cleans (huh?).  He <br/>
has gotten snotty and rude, and sometimes he hits me or shoves me.<br/>
<br/>
How do you all handle chores and such?  Like dishes, picking up clothes, <br/>
picking up toys, general helping.  My kids basically refuse!  At first I <br/>
thought forcing them to do it was the thing to do, but couldn&#39;t really <br/>
go with that so now instead of forcing them, I ask, then they say no, <br/>
and I just do it.  My rationale is that I&#39;d rather be happy than right.  <br/>
But of course, I&#39;m not actually happy, I&#39;m downright tired.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t know me and have no way of knowing what our household is like, <br/>
so....  In a nutshell, like many of you, we are unschoolers, I breastfed <br/>
Cy until 2 1/2, Ethan until 3 1/2.  They both sleep with me, although my <br/>
sweet husband sleeps in his own bed in another room! (He says there <br/>
isn&#39;t room -- the boys kick!  Well, yeah, of course they do....)  I do <br/>
not &#39;believe&#39; in spanking but, sadly, I admit it has happened from time <br/>
to time, after which I apologize.  Lately, with the increase of stress I <br/>
have resorted to yelling which is horrible, too.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like the &#39;consequences&#39; thing, and there is a list as  long as <br/>
my arm of things I don&#39;t want to do.  The thing is, what DO I do?  My <br/>
goal is to raise happy, confident, secure boys.  I try to find out their <br/>
wishes and desires and interests.<br/>
<br/>
Any given day brings alternating moments of fun, smiles, fighting, <br/>
bickering, shoving, screaming, shreiking, working together, hugging, <br/>
struggling, etc.  Sometimes we are &#39;on&#39;, but it just feels to me that <br/>
the &#39;on&#39; times are beginning to be outnumbered by the &#39;off&#39; times.<br/>
<br/>
Many times I feel desperate.  This morning I was trying to have a <br/>
conversation with Mitch, my husband, but the boys continually interrupt, <br/>
or need something, or fight and attract attention, or SOMETHING!  It was <br/>
maddening.  And it was just another incident in a long line of similar <br/>
incidents.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s odd and confusing about this whole thing is that from my 30&#39;s on <br/>
(I&#39;m almost 42) I have wanted children.  I had this naive attitude that <br/>
if I read enough books, knew well enough what to expect, and had my <br/>
heart in the right place, things would be smooth and peaceful.  Of <br/>
course I realize that that is naive, now that I have kids, but isn&#39;t <br/>
SOME part of that a reality?  I mean, I know that rough times are to be <br/>
expected but this seems ridiculously extreme. I think I am understanding <br/>
and supportive of my kids so the behavior from them is almost a shock!<br/>
<br/>
(My son recently said to me in a fit of anger that he wanted to go live <br/>
at the neighbor&#39;s house.  This is ironic because these same neighbors <br/>
have 2 boards, each one with the name of one of their two boys on it, <br/>
and the boards are used for spanking.)<br/>
<br/>
If any of you have words of reassurance or comfort or suggestions, I <br/>
would greatly appreciate them.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much,<br/>
<br/>

this.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you inject some humour into their fights, send them to the<br/>
Shakespearean Insult Kit<br/>

l and help them pick really funny insults for each other.  Take that, you<br/>
unmuzzled, milk-livered wagtail!  There&#39;s also the Ship of Fools Biblical<br/>
curse generator with some funny curses.  Harken, O ye discourager of the<br/>
brethren, for you will see your pomegranates wither!<br/>

<br/>
Do they each get alone time with you and their dad?  That can help.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When I gave up assigned chores, it seemed like it took way too long for Lars<br/>
to start helping voluntarily, though once in a while he would.  It was after<br/>
I read stuff here and at unschooling-dotcom that I realized I wasn&#39;t really<br/>
doing much for him.  I mean, I was doing meals and minimal housework,<br/>
driving him places, etc., but I wasn&#39;t just doing something for him &quot;just<br/>
because&quot;.  When I started doing that, I started noticing a difference.  But<br/>
he definitely wants to pick his own way of helping.  For instance, he<br/>
recently took over caring for our houseplants.  He was a bit disgusted with<br/>
the way I manage to just barely keep them alive, no more.  He likes to<br/>
jokingly put me down about things, and this was no exception.  But he also<br/>
just took the job over.  He likes doing yard work way more than housework<br/>
and is more likely to say yes to that.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t put up with snotty or rude (unless it&#39;s really a joke like mine<br/>
likes to do) and I wouldn&#39;t put up with hitting, etc.  But I wouldn&#39;t pull a<br/>
heavy about it.  I would say that I don&#39;t do that to him, and I don&#39;t<br/>
appreciate him doing it to me.  Maybe he could tell me in words what&#39;s<br/>
bothering him.  Something like that.  If he still didn&#39;t stop, I&#39;d give<br/>
*myself* a time out.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Been there.  I haven&#39;t hit in years, but I still yell sometimes.<br/>
Surprisingly, Lars is almost always the first to apologize when we fight.  I<br/>
looked at that and decided that *I* needed to learn not to hold grudges.<br/>
And I beat him to the apology the other day.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt; the &#39;on&#39; times are beginning to be outnumbered by the &#39;off&#39; times.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Can you talk with them about it, separately or together, at a time when<br/>
everyone is in a pretty good mood?  Ask if they like the atmosphere around<br/>
your house lately.  If they are bothered by it, maybe they&#39;ll have some<br/>
suggestions.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Been there too.  I also thought it was all about &quot;getting it right&quot;.  If I<br/>
did that, my kids would be &quot;perfect&quot;.  Actual parenthood came as something<br/>
of a surprise.  &quot;If you take care of yourself really well, your baby will be<br/>
healthy.&quot;  Well I did, and my first wasn&#39;t.  &quot;Breastfed babies don&#39;t get<br/>
colic.&quot;  Yeah, tell me another one.  &quot;Attachment parenting will produce<br/>
really happy kids who are easy to get along with.&quot;  Well, it *does* help.<br/>
