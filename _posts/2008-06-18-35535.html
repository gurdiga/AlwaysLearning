<div id="ygrps-yiv-1949979106">&lt;&lt;A competent unschooled kid that truly wants something won&#39;t see it as some <br/>
overwhelming hurdle, but just one thing to figure out on the journey.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I love this!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sorscha decided to take a &#39;K9 & Kid Camp&#39; where she brings her dog & learns <br/>
how to coach him on the dog agility course.  Dog training is definitely one <br/>
of Sorscha&#39;s passions.  When she was deciding on the camp, I told her that <br/>
we had to be at the camp at 7:50 in the morning in the city of Rio Rancho <br/>
just north of us.  That would mean that we would need to get up around 6:00 <br/>
am - this for a family that typically wakes up around 10:30.  At the time <br/>
she said, &quot;Hey Mom, if I get cranky on those mornings, just remind me that I <br/>
wanted to do this.&quot;  I said okay and that was it until the camp started this <br/>
week.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Monday, the first day of camp, I was out watering the garden at 6:30ish and <br/>
Sorscha came out dressed and with teeth brushed all beaming for her first <br/>
day of camp.  She said cheerfully, &quot;Good Morning Mom!&quot;  She then went back <br/>
inside to eat breakfast - Which is a whole other story but I&#39;ll make it as <br/>
simple as possible.  Dave microwaved an already hard-boiled egg and when <br/>
Sorscha took a bite, it exploded in her face - Yes, burnt lips and inside <br/>
gums but she still wanted to go to camp!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We proceeded to go by Walgreen&#39;s to get some ibuprofen and she walked into <br/>
the class as happy as a clam, with wet washcloth hanging from her mouth and <br/>
happy dog on a leash in her hand.  I figured I would plan to take her to the <br/>
emergency room upon leaving the camp at noon, but fortunately it was not <br/>
needed.  And so, I can insert the sentence here (&lt;&lt;A competent unschooled <br/>
kid that truly wants something won&#39;t see it as some overwhelming hurdle, but <br/>
just one thing to figure out on the journey.&gt;&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There wasn&#39;t a hurdle in her waking up early even though we have been asked <br/>
many times, &quot;How is she going to learn that she is going to &#39;have to&#39; wake <br/>
up for a job or college or something?&quot;  And there was certainly no hurdle <br/>
when she burnt her mouth but still couldn&#39;t stand to miss her camp.  Passion <br/>
is passion.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1528567656">I completely agree - Kai is very passionate about Karate, and has figured out for himself that he needs to drink water, have a clean outfit, wash his feet, and get rest. In fact, he&#39;s actually completely re-oriented his awake schedule from 12:00pm - 2:00am to 7:00am - 10:00pm - all by himself. These were a lot of changes for him - but because he identified a passion that he wanted to pursue, he figured out what he needed to do and got it done. He never saw the changes as hurdles or obstacles, so they seemed like no big deal to him - just part of what he needed to do to pursue his passions. It&#39;s amazing!  <br/>
