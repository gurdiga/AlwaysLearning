<div id="ygrps-yiv-639862052">I have heard mentioned that Sandra and other greats have some audio <br/>
recordings from a Live and Learn week that are very inspirational.  I <br/>
have looked for the links to these but cannot seem to find them.  I <br/>
would love it if someone could share the link or point me in the right <br/>
direction!<br/>
<br/>
As well, wondering if anyone has any experience with the &quot;Not Back to <br/>
School Camp&quot; put on by Llewellyn??  <br/>

&gt; Nope, I choose not to have that option when I ordered my computer.  Now<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m kicking myself.  I was able to order a CD of Diana&#39;s talk from the Life<br/>
&gt; is Good Conference.   That will keep me happy until I figure out how to get<br/>
&gt; some other talks on CD.<br/>

My daughter went to the Vermont session of NBTSC last year and had an <br/>
amazing time.  It was a great experience for her.  She said it was <br/>
nothing like she thought it would be but better than she could have <br/>
imagined.  She is planning on going back this year and is really <br/>
looking forward to it.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Both my kids have had such positive experiences at NBTSC.  They are  now 15 <br/>
and 18.  My oldest daughter went to 4 camp sessions on the east  coast.  She&#39;ll <br/>
be in college this year but my son plans on attending the  session in Vermont <br/>
in September.<br/>
 <br/>
My daughter would be very happy to share some of her experiences at camp if  <br/>
you would like to write to me off-list.  From listening to the stories they  <br/>
have told after coming home from camp, the first words that come to mind are  <br/>
empowering and life-changing.  All good stuff from our perspective.<br/>

really liked that talk!   I wish I had a way to record it so that I could<br/>
listen to it somewhere besides while I was sitting at my computer. I also am<br/>
really interested in the Mindful Parenting one with Ren and Sandra from 2005<br/>
and there is one called Flow that&#39;s by Sandra that I&#39;d like to listen to.  I<br/>
kept reading about the downloads and I wanted to hear so many of them!<br/>
Heck, if I had the money, I&#39;d order the entire conference!  I have dial up<br/>
internet and so it takes forever to download any of the talks, but, totally<br/>
worth it if I could record it onto something (I *really* like listening to<br/>
them in the car).<br/>

can put anything I record into MP3 format so I can put it on my iPod  <br/>
or burn a cd.<br/>
<br/>
That might be a Mac-only program - I&#39;m not sure. But, if so, there is  <br/>
probably something equivalent for PCs.<br/>

you can transfer the mp3 format easily that way :) or borrow an mp3 player??<br/>
