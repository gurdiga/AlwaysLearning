The most effective kind of conditioning is &#39;random reward&#39; where the reward<br/>
is not guaranteed, but is based on random chance with the reward becoming<br/>
less and less likely over time or the behaviour needed to get it becoming<br/>
more difficult (but still with a random element) , and the desired behaviour<br/>
increasing proportionately.**<br/>

Heh.  I think this is why some men will continue to date utterly irrational women.  They are hooked on the variable response. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
