<div id="ygrps-yiv-202156677">The old chatroom company went out of business.  I&#39;m using a new one.   <br/>
You can choose the color of your name.  We lose the international  <br/>
flags.  But the GOOD NEWS is that you can enlarge the fonts as you see  <br/>
them with the same old command+<br/>
Some people couldn&#39;t read the other one well because the font was dinky.<br/>

<br/>
Same address<br/>
