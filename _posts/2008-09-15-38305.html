hear a  trace of some letters in words like the &quot;L&quot; in talk or the &quot;H&quot; in ghost <br/>

other  words, just ones I&#39;m not being able to recall at the moment. Those are <br/>
more  along the lines of &quot;companion letters&quot;, probably, and I can&#39;t recall the  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1969020132">I just thought of one of the words I was trying to remember:  talk. The &quot;L&quot; <br/>
is supposedly silent, but it&#39;s kind of heard. Just a small bit. Or  is that one <br/>
of those cases Sandra was talking about where the gal was trying to  <br/>
pronounce every available letter? :: grin :: I&#39;m not really talking a specific  <br/>
dialect, here-more &quot;nation newscaster accent&quot; (even though that&#39;s not really  <br/>
definitive, as they all have hints of their origins in their speech as well, but  I <br/>
think you get where I&#39;m going with that description...) So, walk would be  <br/>
another like that, but it&#39;s still basically the same sound, just a different  <br/>

<br/>
Oh right.  &quot;Swallowed consonant,&quot; which means (I think generally)  <br/>
that it affects the way the vowel is prounounced but isn&#39;t actually  <br/>
heard in it&#39;s full-on letter form.  So you don&#39;t put your tongue all  <br/>
the way to where the &quot;l&quot; sound is, but kind of toward it.<br/>
