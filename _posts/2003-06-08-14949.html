<br/>
Humor, but based on real stuff (as funniest humor must be).<br/>
<br/>
I came across this looking for links for a woman at www.unschooling.com who <br/>
told us we&#39;re going to go to hell for not spanking our children.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
Uh-huh.<br/>
<br/>
She clarified that it&#39;s okay for husbands to spank their wives too.<br/>
*yawn*<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-311656969">Checked out the site you recommended as humourous.  Sounds like it was <br/>
written by a bitter, cynical person.  I&#39;m sorry that they have felt so hurt <br/>
or angered by whatever.  However, I stand as a Christian and while not <br/>
everyone may understand my every conviction (and tha page was certainly not <br/>
an accurate depiction of my convictions) I will not be shamed.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL I have said before, to many a person who disagree with my mommyhood <br/>
practices, that I will happily go to Mommy Hell, cuz at least I&#39;ll get to party <br/>
with all my friends, cuz they&#39;ll surely be there too. Although the last time I <br/>
said it, Kass & Kree chimed in with, &quot;But mommy, you don&#39;t believe in hell so <br/>
how can you get to go there?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I laughed, but they really wanted an answer. Finally I said, &quot;You know how I <br/>
always talk about people who believe in hell are the only ones afraid of <br/>
getting there? I was being sarcastic.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
They got me rolling once again when they said, &quot;Oh like the bumper sticker <br/>
that says &#39;It&#39;s your hell, you burn in it.&#39;?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I said &quot;Yep, that&#39;s it!&quot; And LMAO the whole ride home.<br/>
<br/>
Rhonda - And if you wonder why I say &quot;They&quot; when Kass & Kree speak it is <br/>
because they totally do the twin thing where they speak parts of sentences, one <br/>
starts, the other fiinishes. It&#39;s actually pretty amazing how it works and I <br/>
still look at them with amazement that I got to have two at one time.<br/>
