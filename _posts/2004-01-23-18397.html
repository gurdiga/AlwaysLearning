<div id="ygrps-yiv-1811282792">Evie (3 3/4) woke up this morning and started her day with peanut butter and<br/>
jelly in bed (the usual).  Then we went downstairs and watched a movie about<br/>
sheep.  It was so good!  It showed shearing, kids taking them to a fair,<br/>
caring for them etc.  That led us to reading one of our favorite crazy books<br/>
&quot;Our Animal Friends at Maple Hill Farm&quot; by Martin Provenson.  That led to<br/>
turning a mattress on its side and climbing  it to pick imaginary peaches.<br/>
Our cat became a cow, the bathroom became the barn. . .you get the idea, we<br/>
played farm all morning.  Then Evie starts giving me a detailed lecture on<br/>
plant respiration, how it is different from the way we breathe and how<br/>
plants make their own food from sun, water and air (she got all this from a<br/>
Magic School Bus episode awhile ago).  Then it was back to picking peaches<br/>
and she starts singing, &quot;We&#39;re off to pick the peaches, the most wonderful<br/>
peaches of all&quot; to the tune of &quot;We&#39;re off to see the Wizard.&quot;  She has never<br/>
seen The Wizard of Oz, and she has not (despite my recommending them in a<br/>
previous post) heard the Oz books, where she came up with the tune and song<br/>
I don&#39;t know. . .I LOVE that I don&#39;t know!<br/>
<br/>
This afternoon Evie has told me she plans to &quot;knit a potato.&quot;  I can&#39;t wait<br/>
to see what she means!<br/>
<br/>
What did you and your family do today?  Let&#39;s revel in our crazy, fun, scary<br/>
unschooling, REAL lives!<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-774801907">I love your story, Jen :)  Just wanted to let you<br/>
know, I have bags of stinky, unwashed sheep&#39;s wool<br/>
from our sheep, Joshua, and if Evie would be<br/>
interested in some I can send it to you.  Send me your<br/>
address off-list :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We went downtown to the Spy Museum in DC.  I recommend<br/>
it, but for kids who can read.  There wasn&#39;t much to<br/>
hold the interest of my 5yo, who was about a foot too<br/>
short and didn&#39;t want me to read any placards to him<br/>
(who cares about some      spies...I want to BE a<br/>
spy...can we go the gift shop...) and who didn&#39;t want<br/>
*me* to read any either because it slowed him down.  I<br/>
think I need to go again, on a secret date with my<br/>
hubby, just so I can really enjoy it.<br/>
<br/>
The 12yos and the 14yos in our group loved it, though.<br/>
 Tons of american and world history, and I did learn a<br/>
few interesting things when I could sneak a look here<br/>
and there.<br/>
<br/>
My own 12yo stayed home, because he had an anxiety<br/>
attack and didn&#39;t want to go (poor kid had an edoscopy<br/>
yesterday, and it was very stressful), so I bought him<br/>
some way cool stuff at the gift shop.  A CD of spy<br/>
music, and a pack of cards with the Iraqi most wanted<br/>
on them.<br/>

What is most important and valuable about the home as a base for children&#39;s growth into the world is not that it is a better school than the schools, but that it isn&#39;t a school at all.  John Holt<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-844566296">The morning started with Megan coming in to wake me up, and climbing up into my bed to snuggle. Logan was already there having slept there, but he woke up. The Gracie woke up so we had her in the bed, then Sarah joined us. <br/>
 <br/>
We sang some children&#39;s songs for a few minutes, then headed out to the living room. Paul came home shortly afterwards, and I headed out to the store for some milk. We had breakfast when I came back - biscuits and honey. By the time we&#39;d eaten it was time for me to head to the dentist. I have no idea what they did while I was gone. When I got home, Megan was ready for her nap so we settled in to watch &quot;Seven Alone&quot; (based on the book &quot;On To Oregon&quot; By Honore&#39; Morrow as told by Catherine Sanger). <br/>
 <br/>
Megan and Gracie have both tried to nap but been woke up by Logan being too loud. Right now he&#39;s watching &quot;There Goes A Firetruck&quot; (after asking me nicely if he could stop my movie since I had jumped on the computer to go through my emails after Paul got on it). <br/>
 <br/>
Here in a few minutes I have to go wash some dishes so I can get dinner fixed....no idea what will happen through the rest of the evening...Sarah&#39;s been over at a friend&#39;s all afternoon, by the way. <br/>
