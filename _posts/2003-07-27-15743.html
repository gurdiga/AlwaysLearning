 </span></blockquote>Wow!  That&#39;s very cool.  The website is awesome, too.  When he goes to <br/>
Bentonville to pitch it to Wal-Mart, make sure he stays at the Clarion Hotel.  The <br/>
white-haired guy who drives the courtesy van is my dad.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve actually seen that Beyond 2000 show with those skates.  Do they work on <br/>
snow?  <br/>
<br/>
My brother is waiting on a patent for a device used in commercial bakeries. <br/>
Long way to go to get one of those.  My son is forever writing to companies <br/>
pitching them his ideas on how to improve their products (Chik-Fil-A gave him <br/>
coupons, Honda &quot;filed his letter for future reference&quot;.)   I am certain that he <br/>
will want some TrailSkates, and I&#39;ll be sure to tell him how they got started.<br/>

<br/>
No, well at least we don&#39;t know of anyone who uses them on snow.  I suppose you could try it with studded tires :-0  He developed the skates so he could go down hills fast when there wasn&#39;t snow.  I stick to fairly level surfaces on them.  Pat has mellowed out with his use of them too.  He leaves the extreme skating to the youngsters.  He does still enjoy an occasional down hill ride though.  <br/>

The patent process is very specific.  It was not an easy document to type, because some of the language used didn&#39;t make sense to me.  Good luck to your brother!<br/>
