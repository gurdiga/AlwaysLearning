<div id="ygrps-yiv-36174397">Hi: I&#39;m hoping some of you with older teens will be able to help me think<br/>
this through.<br/>
<br/>
My older daughter (14) is interested in paganism.  She&#39;s been reading about<br/>
it and I&#39;m taking her to a local festival so she can check things out.<br/>
<br/>
She comes by this interest naturally enough - I love learning about<br/>
different faiths. We attend a UU church, and she&#39;s acquainted with some<br/>
pagan adults in the church.<br/>
<br/>
I have mixed, uncomfortable feelings about paganism.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the first situation where I can&#39;t whole-heartedly endorse one of her<br/>
interests. I have a pretty low tolerance for new-age kinds of thinking and I<br/>
want to protect her from negative fallout from some of our more conventional<br/>
friends. It&#39;s not as easy as if she were expressing an interest in<br/>
Christianity or Judaism. &lt;g&gt;  On the other hand, I also don&#39;t want to squash<br/>
her curiosity - if she&#39;s interested I want to support that interest.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s very aware that not everyone is accepting of paganism. We live in a<br/>
fairly small town (14,000), and are out in the community - people know us.<br/>
We&#39;re already careful about how we talk to people about our homeschooling,<br/>
so being discrete is nothing new to her.<br/>
<br/>
I remember being interested in paganism when I was in my late teens/early<br/>
20&#39;s, but it was an intellectual curiosity and I was living in a big city<br/>
where people really didn&#39;t care what you believed. I think the part that<br/>
makes me most nervous about this for her is that she might be ostracized by<br/>
some of her friends (or more likely her friend&#39;s parents) if they found out<br/>
she was pagan or even dabbling in it.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - please let me know if you have any thoughts. Best wishes, Cara<br/>
<br/>

I have a couple of ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could ask the pagan friends from church whether she could go  <br/>
with them to the next ceremony/observance.  There might be a May Day- <br/>
ish thing.  Summer Solstice is coming in June.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe both you and she could talk about it in terms of her looking  <br/>
into it, studying it, doing a long-term observation... something.   <br/>
Call it anthropology/study of religion, maybe.  If she &quot;converts&quot; at  <br/>
some point, that would be &quot;at some point&quot; and not in advance of her  <br/>
even knowing more about it.<br/>

<br/>
I understand your concerns about your daughter being ostracised for her interest in paganism - it&#39;s hard when as unschoolers you are already in a tiny minority. But she is a teenage girl exploring different ideas as her worldview broadens. An interest in a certain belief system now doesn&#39;t mean she will adopt it wholesale for the rest of her life. Supporting these explorations shows her that her interests are important to you. As with any other strongly-held belief on the part of the parents, I think the best thing to remember is that those are your beliefs, not necessarily your children&#39;s. Living by your principles without foisting them on others is the best way to demonstrate their worth.<br/>

In my limited understanding of it, the devil probably doesn&#39;t exist, since that dichotomy isn&#39;t part of that religious belief.  Paganism is huge, and there are many ways in which people follow it.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think Paganism is a new age thing.  There are new age ideas that piggy back onto Paganism, but Paganism is older than the Greeks, there is nothing new about it.<br/>

early Christians called the non-Christian religions of the people they  <br/>
came in contact with. It&#39;s like saying &quot;not Caucasian&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Is there anyone practicing a &quot;pagan&quot; religion passed in an unbroken  <br/>
chain of practitioners from the early days of Christianity? I&#39;d be  <br/>
very surprised! Current day pagans may have revived some old practices  <br/>
and beliefs but it was never one religion so present day practices are  <br/>
just what feels like it works together.<br/>

<br/>
Exactly!  What Diana said about historically following Christianity is pretty accurate in learning about Paganism.  My basic understanding is that Paganism is anything that isn&#39;t monotheistic, and that&#39;s the basic underlying factor.  The Greeks fit that category and so did the Celts, and probably all the people who practiced Hinduism were considered Pagan.<br/>
<br/>
In its modern day form, it encompasses anyone who isn&#39;t following a monotheistic religious practice.  It can take the form of any local indigenous religious practice, so &quot;new age&quot; is something that could certainly be co-opted into a Pagan belief system.<br/>

<br/>
Joyce already made the point I was going to make<br/>
<br/>
Paganism is a reconstruction.  It&#39;s a little like being one of the  <br/>
historic reenactors at a living history museum, only some of the  <br/>
people in the religion are unaware of that.  And most living history  <br/>
museums have MUCH more evidence for who would have been there, wearing  <br/>
what, speaking of what.<br/>
<br/>
Paganism is like wicca/witchcraft.  It&#39;s created of clues and parts.<br/>

Or, reading&#39;s a valuable skill, so I&#39;m going to teach and work with them until they get that. Not reading and not doing times tables can also get you ostracized. Guess what? Making your child do those things to fit in is not unschooling. Neither is NOT supporting your daughter, because of your discomfort.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s more valuable to know that your parent supports your interests, way of being, and place on your path no matter what. In your reluctance and caution, you ARE saying that other people&#39;s opinions are more important than your daughter. You can be the open, safe space she needs *if* someone rejects her for her interests. But you can only be that if you drop the judgment and discomfort.<br/>
<br/>
A friend posted this quote on facebook today:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I support my children&#39;s complex/non-typical interests and desires by seeing Who They Are in their hearts, and by ignoring mainstream&#39;s *popular* voice. That&#39;s what I did from the moment I gave birth to the most unique child I had ever known...one who went SO completely *against the grain* of mainstream. And that&#39;s what I continue to do in all that they express an interest in. Because when I shut out what *others* say, and when I do the work to move past my own preconceived judgments and definitions, I see Their Joy, Their True Interest, and my world is greatly expanded. The best part? My children and I move closer together in our relationship...trust and respect are built up instead of dwindled down.&quot;  ~ Anne Ohman<br/>
<br/>
Why teach your daughter to twist and hide who she is? Expand to be the space she fits into, don&#39;t ask her to crush herself to fit in somewhere else. Help her create a community of people and friends who accept her, so those who don&#39;t won&#39;t have as big of an effect. My son has a large online group of friends, fellow geeks who understand and &quot;get&quot; each other. He hasn&#39;t had to change one thing about himself to live in our community; we created community for him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1346171764">I just had another thought I wanted to throw into the ring.<br/>
<br/>
In the How to Be A Good Unschooler list that Pam S. wrote &lt;<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/pam/howto">http://sandradodd.com/pam/howto</a>&gt; there&#39;s a bit about natural consequences.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;8. Let kids learn. Don&#39;t protect them or control them so much that they<br/>
don&#39;t get needed experience. But, don&#39;t use the excuse of &quot;natural<br/>
consequences&quot; to teach them a lesson. Instead, exemplify kindness and<br/>
consideration. If you see a toy left lying in the driveway, don&#39;t leave it<br/>
there to be run over, pick it up and set it aside because that is the kind<br/>
and considerate thing to do and because kindness and consideration are<br/>
values you want to pass on to your kids. Natural consequences will happen,<br/>
they are inevitable. But it isn&#39;t &quot;natural&quot; anymore if you could have<br/>
prevented it, but chose not to do so.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How does this relate to teens and helping them negotiate their way in the<br/>
world?<br/>

to Albuquerque for a few years, because there IS no &quot;anonymous&quot; in a  <br/>
small town.   A friend of mine needs AA right now, but he&#39;s in Silver  <br/>
City, recently moved there because he married into one of the most  <br/>
prominent families in the area.  He can&#39;t go to AA there; it won&#39;t work.<br/>

whatever, they don&#39;t need to know yet.<br/>
<br/>
Someone living in a small town is living in a small town.  They might  <br/>
not need to lock their car or their house.  They might get to take  <br/>
their groceries home and pay next time, if they forgot their money at  <br/>
the store.  But there are some things worth waiting for later about.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-696375758">-=-I think the difference is that I see negotiating living in a small  <br/>
town as<br/>
being like learning to drive a car. It helps you to get to places to  <br/>
do the<br/>
things you want.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I read this after I used the subway example.<br/>
<br/>
True!  There are people from public-transportation places who will  <br/>
move to a rural area and expect to be able to live without a car.  The  <br/>
realities of life can be bigger than ideals sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
If we were talking Christianity, a quick conversion would be necessary  <br/>
in case she died soon.  That would be eternal salvation we were  <br/>
talking about.<br/>
<br/>
Neo-paganism isn&#39;t a life and death situation, and so shouldn&#39;t be  <br/>
considered as a religious conversion in the same way Christianity or  <br/>
Islam would be.<br/>

they are inevitable. But it isn&#39;t &quot;natural&quot; anymore if you could have<br/>
prevented it, but chose not to do so.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

in the world?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I watched a good documentary recently on homosexuality in  <br/>
fundamentalist Christian families.  It was called &quot;For The Bible Tells  <br/>
Me So.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going for a loop off topic for just a moment, because it parallels.<br/>
<br/>
If a fundamentalist family could accept that a son or daughter was  <br/>
homosexual and could trouble themselves to learn what is and what is  <br/>
really NOT in the Bible, that would be enough.  To let them live in  <br/>
peace in the family would be enough.<br/>
<br/>
If that family were in a small town in the southern U.S. (or some  <br/>
other kinds of places in the world), it would be horribly  <br/>
irresponsible for them to encourage that child to make extreme  <br/>
physical-appearance changes, or to even go out and be open about the  <br/>
sexuality.  If the reality is that in some places it will mean death  <br/>
to the child or shunning of the entire family, then the prudent thing  <br/>
would be to accept it privately but keep it private.  When the child  <br/>
is ready to move, the decision of where to move would probably involve  <br/>
that factor and the parents would be compassionate to advise  <br/>
accordingly.<br/>

I respectfully disagree. I believe the same principles apply to religion as apply to any other personal interest or decision a child makes which is outside the &quot;norm&quot;.  While it may not be necessary to broadcast it to the community, I believe it is harmful to hide it and can cause unnecessary shame and confusion.  If it becomes public knowledge in a natural way, the child should have the tools to handle that.  If you suspect it will be looked on unfavorably, that is knowledge you should share with your child before they encounter hostility.  <br/>
 <br/>
*** EXAMPLE:  Our daughter wanted to dye her hair blue and we offered to her that her more conservative friends have made fun of others in the past when they don&#39;t &quot;fit the mold&quot; and had she considered their possible reactions.  She thought &quot;surely they won&#39;t treat ME like that&quot; and asked what they would think BEFORE she did it.  They made fun of her and told her they wouldn&#39;t be seen with her if she did it.  She did it anyway, but with full knowledge of the potential reaction and with preparation of how she would handle it. ***<br/>
 <br/>
We live in a small town and attended one of the larger, most influential Christian churches in the town partly because you&#39;re &quot;suppose to attend church and it&#39;s suppose to be Christian&quot;.  When we broke free from the &quot;suppose to&quot; life, we were very clear with ourselves and our children about the potential repercussions.  It would have been irresponsible to withhold that knowledge while they were in the midst of making their decisions.  We don&#39;t volunteer our beliefs to others because there is no immediate need to do that, but if it comes up naturally (i.e. you must sign this statement of Christian faith to attend this class) then we address it at the time in an appropriate manner (i.e. we don&#39;t sign public statements on private matters).<br/>

If it weren&#39;t for that, this would be a tiny town. That might make a difference to some extent but most of the locals and most people in the military are Christian religious conservatives. People stand out on the street corner on Sunday holding signs about the end of the world and salvation and such on a regular basis. I drive around with an applique (?) on my car that is a fish with 4 legs holding a wrench. It says, &quot;evolve&quot; inside.That&#39;s not quite as confrontational as the bumper sticker described here, maybe, but I&#39;m sure it&#39;s offensive to some.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-866528439">I&#39;m coming in a bit late but I&#39;ve been thinking about this thread and had some questions.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I want to protect her from negative fallout from some of our more conventional<br/>
&gt; friends. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What might that look like (the negative fallout)? Would that be scary (potentially violent) or would it just be more of a social issue (as you state below)?<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like your daughter would be able to keep this as a private, quiet part of her life (discreet), so maybe the friends don&#39;t need to know anything about this (until your daughter is ready to be more public about it). I explored Wicca for a brief time in my early 20s but I didn&#39;t feel a need to tell anyone (especially my Baptist family) about it... and they still don&#39;t know. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think the part that<br/>
&gt; makes me most nervous about this for her is that she might be ostracized by<br/>
&gt; some of her friends (or more likely her friend&#39;s parents) if they found out<br/>
&gt; she was pagan or even dabbling in it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How does your daughter feel about that? Is she worried about losing friends? Or these particular friends? If it&#39;s a possibility, it&#39;s certainly something for her to consider... maybe not so much as an &quot;if&quot; but as a &quot;how&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I&#39;m not big on using &quot;what might the neighbours think&quot; as the litmus test for deciding whether or not to pursue an interest. If your daughter isn&#39;t worried about losing friends, then it might be fine for her to go ahead with her exploration (if you can also be fine with it... I did see that bit about your concerns about New Age stuff). And if she is worried about losing friends, then perhaps you can help her explore discreet ways to pursue this interest (I think suggestions may have already been given).<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s 14. She&#39;ll soon be at the age where she&#39;ll explore this without your support if she really wants to (maybe she&#39;s already there). And I think you can certainly advise her and share your concerns without making the decision for her.<br/>
