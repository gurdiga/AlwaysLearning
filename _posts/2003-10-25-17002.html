<br/>
Actually, with Zach taking the snacks from me he is also now actually<br/>
eating.  He had 4 small helpings of whole wheat spaghetti and tomato sauce<br/>
last night along with 2 glasses of milk.  It has made a big difference.  I&#39;m<br/>
wondering if he was just too busy to think about eating before so when he<br/>
realized he needed something to eat, he REALLY needed something to eat.<br/>
Sugar and refined food would give him a quick energy boost.  Getting the<br/>
less refined snacks through out the day brought to him perhaps helps him not<br/>
be already in an energy slump when he eats.  I don&#39;t know but I wonder.<br/>
