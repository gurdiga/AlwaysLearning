<div id="ygrps-yiv-1482198143">isn&#39;t the correct spelling of googol. Not that it matters. Not that it is on topic. But the other day, due to Linnaea asking in the car &quot;how big is a google&quot; (which is how I was spelling it in my head), I looked it up. It&#39;s a 1 followed by 100 zeros, and it isn&#39;t spelled google, it is googol. I love that google has changed the spelling of googol in most people&#39;s minds. <br/>

Right, the math term.<br/>
I don&#39;t think they misspelled it, I think they intentionally picked a  <br/>
word that was theirs, that had a reference but not, itself, a meaning.<br/>
<br/>
And if they wanted something that lent itself to being a verb, they  <br/>
certainly succeded.<br/>
<br/>
Googol wouldn&#39;t take any very forms very well.  It&#39;s all macho noun.<br/>

Oh!  I heard them on a morning TV show once and they were all smiley  <br/>
and saying &quot;Yeah, we know, but...&quot; and I didn&#39;t listen clearly so  <br/>
maybe they just got happy about it retrospectively.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1790107633">It honestly never occured to me that &quot;Google&quot;, my life-long partner<br/>
(after DH), was named for Googol (1 with 100 zeroes after it), and I<br/>
guess never mentally misspelled the latter.<br/>
Very interesting, and this has prompted a lot of googling googols in<br/>
our home, and lots of learning! (well, *I&#39;m* learning stuff, I cant<br/>
speak for anyone else!)<br/>
