&lt;&lt; Hey Ren,<br/>
   I&#39;ll be in your area in March.  Maybe we could meet somewhere between <br/>
 Pensacola and Fairhope!  It would be fun to put together a name with a face. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Alright Joy!!! Awesome.....<br/>
My Dad is visiting on the 17th, but even if you came during that time we <br/>
could meet up with you.<br/>
Fairhope isn&#39;t very far at all, I&#39;m more than willing to meet you somewhere. <br/>
Email me off list and let me know the details, I&#39;ll give you my phone number.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ren<br/>
&quot;The world&#39;s much smaller than you think.  Made up of two kinds of <br/>
people--simple and complicated.....The simple ones are contented.  The <br/>
complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
