<div id="ygrps-yiv-1570441825">Hi all.  I&#39;ve been lurking on this list for many months and wanted to<br/>
finally introduce myself and thank everyone for sharing their<br/>
unschooling wisdom.  <br/>
<br/>
My name is Tanya.  My significant other of 6 years is Terry, and our<br/>
18mo son is Talon.  We live in Phoenix, Arizona.  <br/>
<br/>
I began researching homeschooling stuff I think when Talon was about<br/>
10 months old.  I promptly came across unschooling and Sandra&#39;s<br/>
website and haven&#39;t looked back.  The concept of unschooling has<br/>
resonated with me from the beginning, and I hope to be completely<br/>
comfortable and confident with our choice by the time Talon becomes<br/>
school age because just the mention of homeschooling to family and<br/>
friends already elicits disapproval.  I have always been the rebel in<br/>
the family, so I can accept disapproval; I just want to get to a point<br/>
where I no longer feel and act defensive when the questions come at<br/>
us.  Terry is also new to the idea of unschooling, but is willing to<br/>
follow my lead in the learning proces.  <br/>
<br/>
So that brings me to thank you.  I appreciate not only all the<br/>
information and personal experiences shared here, but most especially<br/>
appreciate that you, Sandra, and others allow no mistake about what<br/>
unschooling is and isn&#39;t.  It is very difficult for a person new to<br/>
unschooling to wade through a discussion group and pick out inaccurate<br/>
information.  I know I don&#39;t have to worry about that here because the<br/>
more experienced members will point that stuff out, and I really<br/>
appreciate that.  <br/>
<br/>
As for the conference thing, I am wanting to attend the HENA<br/>
conference here in Arizona in March with Terry.  My anxiety is that we<br/>
would need to bring Talon along and I&#39;m not sure how that will work<br/>
out.  I realize that Terry and I can take turns attending different<br/>
talks, though I think we&#39;d both want to hear Gatto.  Talon is a very<br/>
active boy, and I worry that it will just end up to be 2 days of<br/>
chasing him all over the place.  I&#39;m wondering if anyone else who&#39;s<br/>
attended a conference with a toddler can share their experience and/or<br/>
tips to help make it a joyful event.  <br/>
<br/>
So, thanks again to all of you who share your time and wisdom here.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1126770756">Hi Tanya!<br/>
<br/>
We welcome children at the HENA conference.  You are welcome to <br/>
bring him to any talks and other parents will be in the same <br/>
situation. :)<br/>
<br/>
We were hoping to be in a larger venue this year, but a fire in the <br/>
Student Union building at ASU put us back in the same building as <br/>
last year - that means there isn&#39;t extra room as we had hoped when <br/>
we booked JTG, but the room he is speaking in is tiered with stairs, <br/>
parents of small kids often sat on the end of the row  and let kids <br/>
play in the aisle or down front or up in back.  We&#39;ll also have a <br/>
fun room right outside the back door of the main speaking room - <br/>
last year it was a vendor room, but this year we&#39;ll only have two <br/>
vendor rooms and the third will be a hangout/play room for families.<br/>
<br/>
Of course you can take turns and one of you see him one day and the <br/>
other the other day.  But then you have to cordinate seeing Sandra <br/>
and Pam and all the others. :)  The family rate includes <br/>
grandparents for free or you&#39;re welcome to bring a sitter for any <br/>
length of time.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps!<br/>
<br/>
Take care, c.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1592857345">Hi Tanya,<br/>
<br/>
My friend Lilo and I are coming too (from Benson). Another thing you <br/>
could do is &quot;advertise&quot; for a tween or teen also at the conference to <br/>
be with Talon. He or she could even be in the talk with you and Talon <br/>
if that is more comfortable. You wouldn&#39;t have to &quot;chase&quot; then.<br/>
<br/>
Cindy, is there a HENA Yahoo group where people can connect?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-72745695">Hi Tanya!<br/>
<br/>
 I saw Gatto speak last fall at the RE conference and there were <br/>
kids and adults coming in and out...he didn&#39;t seem to notice, he <br/>
seemed totally accepting of everything :-) He is a really great <br/>
man...for me it was interesting to &quot;watch&quot; myself around him, <br/>
because he is MY fathers age and from Pittsburg (which is where I am <br/>
from)he kind of pushed my father buttons &lt;&lt;&lt;which is not all that <br/>
pleasant for me. Anyway...I realized that he is a wonderful, open, <br/>
accepting man, I realized I was coming from my CONDITIONED <br/>
mind&lt;&lt;&lt;which is really the point I&#39;m trying to make :-) Sorry for <br/>
the rambling!<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling really requires watching our conditioning, going to an <br/>
unschooling conference will really help you open up to how things <br/>
are different than how most of us were conditioned. Children are <br/>
totally accepted at the conferences...children are why we are there, <br/>
right?? They are not something that should be kept &quot;outside&quot; the <br/>
grown up stuff, they should be there right next to you Living AND <br/>
Learning &lt;BWG&gt;! SO...GO and enJOY!! <br/>
<br/>
Peace~Love~Free~ Tracy<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have been trying to raise Talon by the principles of unschooling<br/>
from the beginning.  When he was 4mo and became fiercely angry for not<br/>
being able to fit his rattle in his mouth, I knew we needed to find<br/>
different principles for raising him than the strict rules Terry and I<br/>
were raised with.  <br/>
<br/>
Terry and I both have a lot of old conditioning.  It is amazing how<br/>
some of it has already begun to fall away as we mindfully practice<br/>
living by principles rather than rules.  I&#39;m hoping that attending<br/>
conferences will help fill in the blanks and enhance our<br/>
understanding.  I also think it will be beneficial for Terry to hear<br/>
others talk about unschooling.  I&#39;m not always very good at explaining<br/>
stuff, especially something I&#39;m just beginning to understand myself. <br/>
<br/>
I am certainly aware, however, that we still have some serious<br/>
deschooling to do ourselves.  For instance, right now, Talon is<br/>
standing beside me, engaged in one of his favorite activities of<br/>
drinking from a 14-oz cup and dribblig it ALL down in his chin and<br/>
onto his clothes for nothing more than entertainment.  No big deal,<br/>
right?  Well, my whole body is cringing.  And that just tells me I<br/>
have more conditioning to let go.  It is just water after all!  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks also, Tracy, for sharing your Gatto experience.  <br/>

those might be.  I am sitting here thinking quite a bit about<br/>
alternatives.  I look forward to the day that creative ideas and<br/>

easier.  <br/>

Brainstorming is one of the specialties of this group (specialities  <br/>
for members in the U.K. who have great ideas too).<br/>

Cups with lids, drinking outside (yeah, not in winter though) or in  <br/>
the bathtub.  Messy food in the bathtub can be fun.  Pudding with  <br/>
hands.  Pudding as wall paint.  A shower-down.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Why are cringing, or perhaps more accurately what are you cringing about? Is <br/>
it the idea of mess in the house, or that he looks untidy, or that people <br/>
will think he is a sloppy eater and make negative judgements about him or <br/>
you? Is it the idea that he is not taking care of himself or his things - <br/>
some lurking &quot;should&quot; in your mind? Were you never allowed to be messy when <br/>
young?<br/>
<br/>
If it is the tactile sensation of pouring water he likes - which was <br/>
something Jayn was very into - more opportunities to get wet and pour that <br/>
don&#39;t involve standing next to a computer could be salutary. We have played <br/>
great games in the bathroom with squirt bottles in our play clothes or <br/>
swimsuits, including in winter then into the shower to get warm. The best <br/>
times in the world were when we went for a stroll around the neighborhood <br/>
and found sprinklers on by the sidewalk.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn used to stand for an hour or more on the stepladder by the sink full of <br/>
tepid water with numerous plastic utensils and containers. Then she would <br/>
stand for even longer with bubbles. Later she loved making potions with <br/>
vinegar and baking soda and various old spices or cake sprinkles (which melt <br/>
colorfully). I would spread a few dish cloths (or tea towels as we used to <br/>
say back home) to catch the moisture.<br/>
<br/>
If you are worried about his clothes getting wet, or what he looks like all <br/>
wet, well I used to carry a few extra changes of clothes with me all the <br/>
time. My concern was ensuring that Jayn stayed comfortable and warm and <br/>
secondarily saving the interior of the car, but looking cleaner was a nice <br/>
extra. There&#39;s a big difference between hanging out at home and being out in <br/>
public.<br/>
<br/>
Find the source of your discomfort. I&#39;ve found that to be the best path to <br/>
finding the right solution to mitigate it, even if in the end that solution <br/>
was &quot;letting go&quot;.<br/>

I&#39;ve been thinking about this.  I first thought it was just old<br/>
conditioning of &quot;don&#39;t make a mess&quot;.  I&#39;m not sure though.  If Talon<br/>
dribbles water all down his clothes in the morning while he&#39;s still<br/>
wearing his pajamas, I don&#39;t seem to get too worked up about it - we<br/>
just change his clothes and get him dressed for the day.  Same at<br/>
night if he does it, I just change him into his pajamas.  So any other<br/>
time, I guess it&#39;s just about him getting his clothes all wet and<br/>
either wearing wet clothes or having to change.  I guess I would just<br/>
as soon neither be the case.  So, maybe it is just about &quot;don&#39;t make a<br/>
mess&quot; afterall.  I&#39;m not sure.    <br/>
<br/>
The reason he does it is for the sensation of dribbling water down his<br/>
chin.  It&#39;s a new thing and apparently fun.  He does do it in the<br/>
bathtub too.  <br/>

<br/>
This happens to me all the time with unschooling: the discovery that <br/>
two desires that are apparently in conflict can both be met with only <br/>
the smallest of adjustments. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve spent the last five years saying &quot;Yes&quot; all the time, and yet my <br/>
more selfish, &quot;I want things my way&quot; side is all filled up. Maybe it&#39;s <br/>
because all those yeses helped me tap into my own creativity, so it&#39;s <br/>
available to help me get the things *I* want, too.<br/>
