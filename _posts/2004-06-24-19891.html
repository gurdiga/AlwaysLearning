<div id="ygrps-yiv-1764405765">Going to the DMV?<br/>
Consider bringing a compact folding lawnchair, or one of those camping <br/>
sit-upon-tripods.  Then all you need is a good book (not *too* good as <br/>
you&#39;ll need to remember you&#39;re in line!) and maybe some water or <br/>
juice.  You&#39;re set!<br/>
<br/>
I can guarantee that you&#39;ll be the envy of everyone else in line.<br/>
...and it makes the waiting so much nicer.<br/>

appointment, and avoid the whole waiting-in-line-thing!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-186310387">Strangely enough, I recently had the odd experience of telling a DMV worker<br/>
what a great job they&#39;re doing.  We got a new DMV a few years ago, and in<br/>
the several times I&#39;ve been there for various vehicles and family members,<br/>
they&#39;ve been fast, friendly and efficient.  It&#39;s actually kinda frightening.<br/>
Grrr...  I just hate having to admit they did well.  &lt;G&gt;<br/>

in believing or disbelieving; it consists in profession to<br/>
