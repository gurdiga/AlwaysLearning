Irritable? Take a Nap<br/>
Sleep deprivation leads to heightened emotions<br/>
By Katherine Leitzel<br/>
 <br/>
Parents of toddlers have known for years that tired kids have trouble<br/>
controlling their emotions. But recent findings from neuroscientists at<br/>
Harvard University and the University of California, Berkeley, extend far<br/>
beyond temperamental tykes. After the researchers kept adult volunteers<br/>
awake for about 35 hours, they found with MRI scans that sleep deprivation<br/>
impairs the ³rational² prefrontal cortex¹s control over the amygdala, the<br/>
brain¹s emotion center. The result is the moodiness that often accompanies<br/>
exhaustion, described by the team as an amplified response from the brain¹s<br/>
emotion hub. The study also suggested that sleep deprivation interferes with<br/>
the ability of the prefrontal cortex to make logical decisions.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-202648354">Hi, my son of 7 has always gone to sleep with me or occasionally my husband present. I usually read him to sleep or lie with him, (he breasfed to sleep until 15 months). Until about a year ago we had a set bedtime and routine and since then we have been more relaxed about staying up later. Recently he has been wanting to carry on playing or watching beyond the time that I want to go to bed myself but he cannot and does not want to go to sleep by himself. If I stay up late so that I can read to him when he is ready I will be grumpy the next day so I have insisted that he finish watching or playing so that I can read to him and then go to bed, even though he always asks for &#39;just one more&#39;. Tonight he wanted to try watching the iPad in bed and go to sleep by himself, but was unable to which meant that I got out of bed to go tuck him in, etc. <br/>
So I am looking for ideas how I can manage this peacefully when he doesn&#39;t want to stop watching what he is enjoying but needs me to sleep. He is usually so tired by the time I start reading that he hears little of the story but the sound of my voice is enough to send him off. <br/>
BTW He likes to go to sleep in his own bed but usually comes to ours in the wee hours of the morning. On the occasion that he has slept all night in our bed we have none of us had a good nights sleep.<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Sara</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-744130413">Does he have to be specifically read to before he sleeps? Can you cuddle together in his bed with an iPad or some other hand held device? That way he can keep watching and still be with you and you can drift off a bit if you&#39;re really tired. &nbsp;Some nights if I&#39;m extra tired or not feeling as well, and ready for sleep before my 4 yr old, I invite him to cuddle with me in his bed or mine, with my phone or the kindle and I can doze while he watches you tube or plays games.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Lisa C</div></div>
