<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   In a few days both of my daughters will be going to Grace&#39;s<br/>
 </span></blockquote>NBTS  Camp and I feel like this will be the start of an even more<br/>
exciting path for my daughters...<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is going to NBTSC next Friday too!  She has been out of<br/>
school since February.  Last week would have been her first day of<br/>
high school and instead we are planning for camp.  Yipee!  Going to<br/>
camp is such an accomplishment for her.  When I first asked her<br/>
about it she had not slept away from home in years due to anxiety.<br/>
We began treatment before she left school and she was still not sure<br/>
if she could do it.  After e-mailing Grace, talking to some kids and<br/>
parents and deciding my mom and I would stay in VT while she was<br/>
there she agreed to try it.  Since then she was able to stay one of<br/>
two nights at youth group camp, spent three nights with my sister<br/>
(planned for 2 then asked to stay another night)and three nights<br/>
with her god mother in another state.  She is still really nervous<br/>
about going but I know she&#39;ll be ok.  SHe started talking about<br/>
being eaten by a moose but I know she&#39;s worried about getting along<br/>
with the other kids.  I&#39;m not worried even a teensie bit though.  I<br/>
plan on having a lovely vacation and then hearing about all her<br/>
adventures.  I am hoping meeting other unschooling teens will help<br/>
her find some motivation and inspire her.  SHe is still struggling<br/>
with being self directed after so many years in school.  I am<br/>
struggling with being supportive without pushing her.<br/>

Tell them all to look for Cameron Lovejoy. He&#39;s been for several years <br/>
now and is ALWAYS wiling to make a new friend.<br/>
<br/>
I PROMISE he&#39;ll give each one a GREAT BIG HUG! and will sit and chat <br/>
the hours away. He has a genuine interest in whatever you are <br/>
passionate about.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s easy to spot---skinny and soft-spoken with shoulder-length brown <br/>
hair and a Shaggy (from Scooby-Doo) goatee. &lt;g&gt; And he&#39;ll most likely <br/>
be hugging someone!<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s already driving north (spent the night in Northern VA) to Vermont.<br/>
