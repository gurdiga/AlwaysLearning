<div id="ygrps-yiv-1353762338">Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
I realized that I posted a response here, but forgot to introduce  <br/>
myself - I was on this list for awhile (mainly lurking) a few years  <br/>
ago, and of course have been inspired by Sandra&#39;s writings for many  <br/>
years.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Emily and my husband Michael and I live in Portland, Oregon  <br/>
(originally from So. CA) with our four children.<br/>
Morgan is 16, Seth is 8.5, Sara is 6.5 and Jake is 3.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling fits in well with our philosophy of parenting joyfully  <br/>
and mindfully without punishments or rewards of any kind.  I&#39;m a  <br/>
former preschool teacher (interned at Play Mountain Place in LA in  <br/>
1991 which started me on the path of respectful parenting and  <br/>
unschooling), I&#39;m a student postpartum doula (through DONA) and a  <br/>
parent educator (I co-facilitate a class called Connected Parenting  <br/>
with an amazing and dear mama friend).  My oldest son attended  <br/>
Summerhill School briefly when he was 10, and we&#39;ve dabbled in a  <br/>
couple of free schools throughout the years, in the name of seeking  <br/>
more community.  I greatly enjoy unschooling myself, and of course I  <br/>
keep finding new things to learn, new projects to try, and new ideas  <br/>
to think about.  Our family practices &quot;natural family living&quot; in that  <br/>
our kids were born at home, we practice ecological breastfeeding,  <br/>
babywearing, co-sleeping, etc. and we have been inspired by The  <br/>
Continuum Concept.  We attended LIFE is Good last April in Corvallis,  <br/>
OR and had reservations for Live and Learn but didn&#39;t make it (we&#39;ll  <br/>
use those plane tickets this year though!), and are looking forward  <br/>
to meeting some of you in person at LIFE is Good in May...<br/>
<br/>
