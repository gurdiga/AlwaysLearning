<div id="ygrps-yiv-602653481">I just wanted to chime in on how wise the whole one warning thing is <br/>
because I wish I had cut it off at that point.  DH&#39;s parents are what I <br/>
call &#39;toxic people&#39;.  We no longer have any contact with them, it has <br/>
been several months, glorious months I might add.  We let it go too <br/>
long before we did it though.  We should have done it years earlier.  <br/>
We tried lots of partial solutions like limiting visits, only DH <br/>
answers the phone when they call etc...  The problem is that one toxic <br/>
comment is just too big for a kid to deal with and they should never <br/>
have to, it&#39;s MY job to protect them.  So after messing with this for <br/>
far too long DH cut off contact.  I don&#39;t know if a relationship will <br/>
ever happen again, but I&#39;m pretty sure they&#39;ve hosed themselves as far <br/>
as my kids are concerned.  Too bad for them too, they are missing out <br/>
on some really terrific kids.:0)<br/>

adopted. They boycotted our wedding and I cut them out of my life as <br/>
of that day. <br/>
