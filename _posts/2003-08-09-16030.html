homemaker.  I guess I wanna tell my mom, who was never a homemaker but <br/>
who is now retired, that she can retire also from homemaking so she no <br/>
longer has to do any of the things she always hated doing, clean, <br/>
vacuum, etc.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Get a maid and a personal secretary. <br/>
<br/>
Really. I worked for a woman like this. Not only did she have a maid and TWO <br/>
personal secretaries, she had a full-time private chef (M-F), a gardener---and <br/>
the gardener&#39;s wife who did the flowers INSIDE the house. There was the <br/>
foreman, who took care of everything outside (washed the 20 cars and fixed thing <br/>
around the house, maintained the boats, ran errands, ---did whatever needed to <br/>
be done. The massage therapist and the cosmotologist---both of whom worked in <br/>
the &quot;salon&quot; attatched to the bedroom, but they weren&#39;t &quot;full-time&quot;. Who else? <br/>
OH! The LAUNDRESS!!! who just did laundry---no joke! There was the dog <br/>
trainer---of five standard poodles (and there daughter had two mini and two toy <br/>
poodles and a shih tzu)--and of course me, the personal dog groomer. Don&#39;t forget <br/>
all the &quot;little&quot; people, who weren&#39;t &quot;on staff&quot;---the pool guy and such. And I&#39;m <br/>
sure I&#39;m forgetting somebody! The first Christmas I worked there, we had <br/>
EIGHTEEN employees and their spouses at the party. Eighteen paychecks!!!<br/>
<br/>
And she referred to herself as a retired homemaker.<br/>
<br/>
They made a zillions bucks on the stock market. <br/>
<br/>
And they lost it. I&#39;m no longer employed (bummer). They have only the two <br/>
secretaries, and the chef on staff now. There&#39;s a 7 million dollar contract on <br/>
the house now, because they need to downsize and move to AZ where they won&#39;t be <br/>
embarrassed to be seen.<br/>
<br/>
So, yes--retired homemaker. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Probably her kids grew up and moved away.  Maybe her husband died or maybe <br/>
they moved to assisted living.<br/>

I want to live in assisted living for people my age someday.  I figure it <br/>
