<div id="ygrps-yiv-1621733505"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t mean to be rude but, has your daughter<br/>
&gt;&gt;gotten her period yet?<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Nope. She&#39;s 10 and ahalf. No budding, no body odour.<br/>
&gt;Nothing. <br/>
&gt;She&#39;s been like this since birth any way.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;No idea why vampires either, and not say, werewolves<br/>
&gt;or bogey-men.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think you are on to something there Shyrley.  You<br/>
said she had sex obsessiveness before, she is<br/>
incredibly precocious, is not yet having her cycles<br/>
and is terrified of vampires.  Vampires are very SEXY<br/>
&quot;monsters.&quot;  Just look at all the erotic vampire<br/>
fiction, the movies, the sensual qualities.  There is<br/>
something so intimate and dangerous and seductive<br/>
about the whole vampire mythos.  Even the drinking of<br/>
blood is this intimate exchange that is often equated<br/>
with an orgasmic experience by those who make the<br/>
movies and write the stories.  Male vampires bite<br/>
women, female vampires bite men.  <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps her fears are stemming from secret desires or<br/>
longings to be sought out in that manner, to be found<br/>
desirable by a vampire, which fascinates, and<br/>
terrifies her at the same time?  Perhaps all of this<br/>
has to do with feeling that her body SHOULD be more<br/>
mature to match her mind, and she is anxious about<br/>
that.  Perhaps there are also hormones in play here,<br/>
although there are no physical signs.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t start my cycle until I was 13, so I<br/>
sympathise with her.  Maybe she needs some fiction<br/>
with a little romance in it to occupy her mind? <br/>
Perhaps some books designed for teens or young adults?<br/>
 How far you want the fiction to go in terms of sexual<br/>
explicitness is a parental decision of course.  But at<br/>
her age I was reading things like &quot;Friday&quot; and the<br/>
Earth&#39;s Children series by Jean M. Auel, which are<br/>
heavily sexually explicit.  It didn&#39;t confuse, twist<br/>
or damage me.  On the contrary, it answered the<br/>
questions my parents wouldn&#39;t and gave me a knowledge<br/>
base that made me confident in my own sexual identity<br/>
as an adult.  I knew what was what, so I was not<br/>
afraid or defenseless.  Both books have rape in them,<br/>
so you might want to find something a bit more<br/>
romantic and happy.  <br/>
<br/>
One that doesn&#39;t have sex in it, but is a love story<br/>
which I enjoyed reading recently, is &quot;The Hob&#39;s<br/>
Bargain&quot; by Patricia Briggs.  It&#39;s a fantasy story<br/>
with magic and a female heroine.  Another fantasy love<br/>
story with a female heroine  is &quot;Once Upon a Winter&#39;s<br/>
Night&quot; by Dennis L. McKiernan.  It&#39;s a retelling of a<br/>
classic Frog Prince style fairy tale which is really<br/>
good.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just a thought I had based on the information<br/>
given.  Good luck with your daughter.<br/>

my hubby is doing.)</div>
