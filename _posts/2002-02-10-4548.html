her boyfriend being jealous it makes her feel more secure and flattered.  Or <br/>
if he seems to get really angry about little things, you might be able to <br/>
write it off to his having a bad day. <br/>

Often battering really begins during pregnancy. It seems to set a lot of <br/>
batterers off.<br/>
