<div id="ygrps-yiv-611287109">A couple of my kids love MMORPGs and will play them<br/>
for 12-14 hours per day.  But one of them doesn&#39;t<br/>
read yet and the other one just told us yesterday that she<br/>
has been breaking some of the sites&#39; rules, so they both<br/>
need to be supervised while playing.<br/>
<br/>
BUT, much as I enjoy the MMORPGs, I am not happy<br/>
playing them for 12-14 hours a day.  I am an<br/>
outdoorsy person, and an active person.  I get<br/>
physically uncomfortable and then grouchy sitting<br/>
in front of a computer for so many hours at a time.<br/>
I miss sensory input:  wind on my face, the smell<br/>
of the earth warming in the sun and the flowers<br/>
blooming in the garden, the sound of the waterfall<br/>
rushing and the birds singing, the feel of moving<br/>
my muscles as I work...<br/>
<br/>
I am trying to think of a way to afford to hire<br/>
somebody to watch over the kids while the play<br/>
for some of those hours, but don&#39;t know if  I can<br/>
swing it, financially.<br/>
<br/>
I am trying  to think of other solutions and coming up<br/>
blank.  I would say, &quot;If you break the sites&#39; rules,<br/>
then you can only play when I am willing to play,<br/>
too...&quot; but then I know they will sneak on to the<br/>
computer as soon as I go out to the garden.<br/>
<br/>
I am not saying that as a dire &quot;if I let them...&quot;<br/>
statement.  I am saying that they will use the<br/>
computer without supervision b/c we are still<br/>
deschooling, and I remember when we were<br/>
limiting screen time, or trying too, anyway...<br/>
and the kids snuck onto the computers then.<br/>
(Of course; it was forbidden fruit.  Or, carefully<br/>
rationed fruit.)  So, past history tells me, they <br/>
will sneak onto the computer if they want to<br/>
use it.  Also, they flat-out tell me that they<br/>
will use the computers whenever they want<br/>
to.<br/>
<br/>
Do I tell them that when I go for a walk or out<br/>
into the garden, they have to come with me,<br/>
so that I can keep an eye on them?  That sounds<br/>
bossy and punitive, so I don&#39;t like that option.<br/>
<br/>
Getting outdoors and working my muscles is<br/>
important to my  health, physical and mental.<br/>
Sitting in front of a computer for more than<br/>
a few hours at a time is physically painful--I<br/>
just am not comfortable being &quot;stuck&quot; in one<br/>
place--and I get bored of it.  I know there<br/>
is a lot going on in the games, but I simply<br/>
am not as &quot;into&quot; them as my kids are.<br/>
<br/>
I also have three other kids who want/need<br/>
my time and attention, which is another reason<br/>
I can&#39;t just play online games for the bulk of <br/>
my waking hours.  Well, I can, if I choose to<br/>
ignore the three other kids.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to remove the computers from<br/>
the home, as we have five family members<br/>
who use them responsibly and two others<br/>
who enjoy them very much, just need<br/>
supervision.  Besides, removing the computers<br/>
wouldn&#39;t remove the real issue, which is one<br/>
of learning to make good choices vs. choosing<br/>
to make poor choices.<br/>
<br/>
Help?<br/>

It doesn&#39;t matter.  If you were to hire someone to be a watchdog in the <br/>
online activities, that&#39;s not --to my of thinking-- what you really <br/>
want, is it?  If you were to hire someone, would they care to be there <br/>
(even though they&#39;re being paid) for 12 -14 hours per day?  I&#39;m having <br/>
trouble envisioning that as anything approaching realistic.<br/>
<br/>
How long could you stand to sit and get more &quot;into&quot; what you&#39;re kids <br/>
are doing?<br/>
<br/>
Have you considered that online misbehavior (not sure what that might <br/>
be) is a cry for attention?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
No one can be there 100% of the time with each child, even paid folks.  <br/>
All the better reason to value what all your children are doing and to <br/>
care for the --to them-- exciting online activities they enjoy and how <br/>
that relates to other things in life that you can follow up on.  There <br/>
are all kinds of connections to be had from playing MMORGs and other <br/>
online gaming.  If you&#39;re unschooling, then that&#39;s a very important <br/>
part of what you&#39;d want to do with online games... help your children <br/>
explore the connections!  It&#39;s fun (1st of all) ... more fun than it <br/>
looks like from where you are at the moment, increases the connection <br/>
between yourself and all your kids (2nd), and creates ways that you can <br/>
interact with the kids both online and off (3rd).  I&#39;m sure there are <br/>
plenty of other benefits too (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/videogames/)">http://sandradodd.com/videogames/)</a>.  And <br/>
you won&#39;t see those if you&#39;re not &quot;into&quot; it.<br/>
<br/>
You have 5 or 6 kids, right, at least some of whom are adopted?  I&#39;m a <br/>
bit confused about that.  Number one under Pam Sorooshian&#39;s &quot;What <br/>
Unschooling Parents DO&quot;: Respect all of a child&#39;s interests equally.  I <br/>
would also go so far as to say: Respect all of your children&#39;s <br/>
interests equally.<br/>
<br/>
Those two ideas are connected to number 10: Be very observant of what <br/>
your child is really doing - don&#39;t view him/her in a shallow <br/>
superficial way.  Recognize that there is a reason for a child&#39;s <br/>
actions, that a child is &#39;born to learn&#39; and is always learning.  Get <br/>
to know your child&#39;s special favored ways of learning.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; has been breaking some of the sites&#39; rules,&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What does this mean, and does it really matter? How would the site <br/>
administrators know that you were watching her? What is so onerous that she <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to keep the rule to allow her to continue playing happily? If <br/>
she persists in doing something wrong, she will be reprimanded by the game <br/>
site or suspended. Explain the consequences without becoming a cop on behalf <br/>
of a game administrator. That&#39;s like forcing a kid to follow the school <br/>
rules at home (most parents do that willingly - we unschoolers don&#39;t have <br/>
to!)<br/>
<br/>
A lot of kids&#39; sites have the &quot;rule&quot; that the child should ask permission <br/>
before logging on. I don&#39;t insist Jayn keep that rule.<br/>
For other sites I have registered under my name and age to avoid a lot of <br/>
the boring back and forth permission emailing.<br/>
<br/>
Can one of your reading kids help their non-reading sister with any reading? <br/>
Must it be you all the time?<br/>
<br/>
Do you have to sit still beside her to help with reading? Jayn used to just <br/>
ask me to come over and read a screen periodically. Later she would spell <br/>
the word for me to translate for her. Now she pretty much reads it all on <br/>
her own, and only asks rarely.<br/>

&gt; are doing?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I play for two to four hours a day.  I have my own character<br/>
I enjoy playing.  I enjoy spending that time with the kids, and<br/>
I don&#39;t look down on gaming.  I am looking forward to learning<br/>
new online games.  I&#39;m just not as focused as these two are.  <br/>
There are other things I want to be doing for and with my other <br/>
kids, and for myself, and for and with my spouse.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Have you considered that online misbehavior (not sure <br/>
 </span></blockquote>what that might be) is a cry for attention?<br/>
<br/>
No.  I hadn&#39;t.  I will think about that.  <br/>
<br/>
In the past, we had more rules around here, mainly of <br/>
the, &quot;if you took it out, put it back away&quot; variety.<br/>
She consistently ignored those rules.  Reading<br/>
about chores helped me to understand that.<br/>
<br/>
And when we were eclectic homeschoolers, I would<br/>
sometimes ask the kids to do a few workbook pages<br/>
now and again, basically to satisfy state regulations.<br/>
This child is the one who led us down the path to <br/>
unschooling when she refused to do any work out<br/>
of the workbooks, and asked, &quot;Why should I do this?&quot;<br/>
And I had to think about that, and realize that she<br/>
had a good point there.<br/>
<br/>
She and I have talked about rules, about how she feels<br/>
about them.  And in a nutshell, she has told me that<br/>
if there is a rule, she is going to break it.  I asked  her<br/>
why and she said, &quot;Simple.  I don&#39;t like being told what <br/>
to do.&quot; She wants it to be perfectly clear that nobody can <br/>
make her do anything she doesn&#39;t want to do.  She&#39;s right, <br/>
of course, and that attitude could take her far, or land her <br/>
in a lot of trouble.  There is an upside and a downside to it.  <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, she likes when rules protect her.  <br/>
We still have a rule around here: &quot;If you want to use it, <br/>
and it belongs to somebody else, ask the owner for <br/>
permission before using it.&quot;  She will not follow this rule, <br/>
but she will also become angry when siblings go into her <br/>
room without permission and use her books/toys/space<br/>
without her permission.<br/>
<br/>
I have been thinking a lot about rules vs. principles<br/>
and reading and re-reading about that.  We want <br/>
our family members to treat one another kindly and<br/>
with respect.  And taking things without asking (and<br/>
then maybe losing or breaking them) is not very kind<br/>
or respectful.  <br/>
<br/>
As to what the online misbehavior was:<br/>
1) She shared an account with another player, which<br/>
is explicitly against the site&#39;s rules.  <br/>
2) She often responds to solicitations (&quot;Will you be my<br/>
girlfriend?&quot; requests) in the affirmative.<br/>
She says she won&#39;t share personal information.  I<br/>
hope she is being honest with me about that.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;help your children explore the connections!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I believe I am doing that. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It&#39;s fun (1st of all) ... more fun than it looks like <br/>
&gt; from where you are at the moment<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree it is fun.  It&#39;s not fun for me for 14 hours<br/>
everyday, though.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; increases the connection between yourself and <br/>
&gt; all your kids (2nd), and creates ways that you can <br/>
&gt; interact with the kids both online and off (3rd).  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I agree completely.  I have experienced all of<br/>
this, and it is all great.  But the 14 hours a day is<br/>
not great for me.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m sure there are plenty of other benefits too <br/>

&gt; you won&#39;t see those if you&#39;re not &quot;into&quot; it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I like that page.  So much good material to use<br/>
when speaking to critical relatives about the kids<br/>
gaming.  I was really surprised when I started playing,<br/>
how challenging the games were.  It&#39;s not that I <br/>
don&#39;t like the games.  It&#39;s that I don&#39;t like playing<br/>
online games all day, every day.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You have 5 or 6 kids, right, at least some of whom <br/>
&gt; are adopted?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Right, I have two biological children and three<br/>
adoptive children.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Respect all of your children&#39;s interests equally.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I want to do that.  I think I am doing that.  But I can&#39;t <br/>
be simultaneously hiking in the woods with the kids <br/>
who want to do that and playing online games with the <br/>
kids who want to do that.  I&#39;m not saying, &quot;Ugh.  I am<br/>
sick of playing these stupid games.&quot;  I am saying, <br/>
&quot;Well, this has been fun, but I&#39;m feeling fidgety and<br/>
I really feel like going outside and stretching my legs<br/>
now.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Be very observant of what your child is really doing - <br/>

&gt; favored ways of learning.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m trying to absorb your help; I really am.  I&#39;m not understanding<br/>
how the paragraph directly above applies, unless I accidentally <br/>
conveyed the idea that I don&#39;t like playing online games and that I <br/>
don&#39;t value the gaming.  If I conveyed that idea, I apologize.  I do <br/>
enjoy the gaming and I am happy that the kids have found something <br/>
about which they are passionate.  I just don&#39;t enjoy gaming exclusively.  <br/>
I have a variety of interests and, yes, other kids with other interests,<br/>
and I am trying to figure out how to balance out of that.  <br/>
<br/>
Or am I missing the point?  Not being defensive here; really<br/>
trying to understand and make use of the advice.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2136389483"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A couple of my kids love MMORPGs and will play them<br/>
 </span></blockquote>for 12-14 hours per day.  But one of them doesn&#39;t<br/>
read yet and the other one just told us yesterday that she<br/>
has been breaking some of the sites&#39; rules, so they both<br/>
need to be supervised while playing. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
A couple of other tweaks and then an idea for some things you could do <br/>
that are more active while hanging out with your kids who are online.  <br/>
We have computers and a wirelessly connected laptop that&#39;s newer which <br/>
we use mostly for watching Netflix and other movies and tv stuff.  The <br/>
desktops are situated side by side, one to a table/desk area.  This is <br/>
so anybody can hang out in here while one or more of us are online and <br/>
talk, play other games or puppets or swords and other things which are <br/>
really similar in intent to mmorpg&#39;s by the way.<br/>
<br/>
One tweak is to find out what the child is looking for who is breaking <br/>
online rules.  Have you inquired by observation to see what the deal is <br/>
and looked into other ways to get what s/he wants.  Maybe join <br/>
Unschooling Gamers <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/unschooling_gamers/)">http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/unschooling_gamers/)</a> to get ideas <br/>
and talk more about that issue more specifically.<br/>
<br/>
Another tweak is not to see it as supervision, which is very <br/>
hierarchical, and not conducive to building partnership with children.  <br/>
Approach these issues about online use as a new way to connect with <br/>
your child/ren.  How can you help with reading if you or someone who <br/>
can read isn&#39;t present to help very much.<br/>
<br/>
Being outside and getting what *you* need is great!  Do you have <br/>
laptops or Nintendo DS&#39;s or some way to make it more comfortable <br/>
(lounge chairs, hammocks etc) for your children to simultaneously hang <br/>
out doing what they love to do and be with you, a person they need in <br/>
their lives as much as possible?  Brian just got me a used phone from <br/>
eBay that wifi&#39;s for $80 (Samsung).  It has a little keyboard that pops <br/>
out, and on that I can download games and play!  And check email and <br/>
browse somewhat as well, although I like the desktop much better for <br/>
email stuff.<br/>
<br/>
For yourself, do you like to knit or cook or sew (things you could <br/>
indoors do while hanging out with your kids) or do you have a potting <br/>
shed that&#39;s comfortable for some kids to hang out in with you.  Since <br/>
you&#39;re outside a lot, is there a tarp/tent/gazebo like area for all of <br/>
you to hang out together wifi&#39;ing, playing with games/toys, and <br/>
gardening/potting plants, starting seeds, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Find ways to make your activities and your kid&#39;s activities intersect <br/>
more.<br/>

viruses accidentally b/c he can&#39;t read and he doesn&#39;t know what<br/>
he&#39;s clicking on.  I can&#39;t figure out how to set the security settings<br/>
high enough to avoid that but low enough to allow the game <br/>
content through.<br/>
<br/>
So, in sum, with my daughter, I am worried she is going to get<br/>
into a cyber-stalker type of relationship, because if she is willing<br/>
to break rules, why wouldn&#39;t she break the rule against sharing<br/>
personal information?  With my son, we&#39;ve already had one<br/>
computer destroyed by a virus and don&#39;t want to go there again.<br/>
For myself, I don&#39;t want to spend 14 hours a day online.  Four<br/>
is about my limit.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-42322168"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I don&#39;t understand this.   For my kids to ever say something like that  <br/>
&gt; to me, things would have to be going very badly.  They&#39;ve never said  <br/>
&gt; anything like that.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s because you did the thinking first and then had children.<br/>
I&#39;ve done it the other way around.  I&#39;ve done some things well<br/>
as a mom and I&#39;ve made some big mistakes, but all I can do<br/>
now is make better choices now and in the future.  Also, you<br/>
had your kids from birth, whereas the ones who speak to<br/>
me in this way came to me at older ages (one was four,<br/>
one was eight, one was a teen) and out of bad situation.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It sounds like your kids are being bossy.  Were you bossy <br/>
&gt; before and  are they treating you as you used to treat them, <br/>
&gt; maybe?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Absolutely that&#39;s true.  I know that.  And the people who<br/>
took care of them--if you could call it that--before they<br/>
came into my life were downright cruel.  So,okay, given<br/>
all that, what do I do now?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Unless they&#39;re able to be in the house unsupervised, I don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; see how  you get to go for a walk or out into the garden anyway.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I thought they were able to be in the house unsupervised.  Now<br/>
I&#39;m not so sure.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; There are thousands of things in the world to do besides playing a  <br/>
&gt; game a kid can&#39;t read.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But they really want to play *this*.  They aren&#39;t interested right now<br/>
in the thousands of other things.  And I don&#39;t want to push the <br/>
thousands of other things too hard, because I don&#39;t want to give<br/>
them the impression that the other things are more worthwhile<br/>
than the gaming.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the non-reader can do many things in the game that don&#39;t <br/>
require reading.  The icing on the cake is that he may be beginning <br/>
to learn some sight words incidental to the play, and he&#39;s told me that<br/>
he&#39;s not sad that he can&#39;t read, so it&#39;s really neat if he can pick up some<br/>
words as he&#39;s playing.  <br/>

But now I have what looks to me to be a safety issue. <br/>

&gt; has been breaking some of the sites&#39; rules, so they both<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just because they are breaking some of the site rules, doesn&#39;t mean they<br/>
need to be supervised.  It depends on what they are doing and how bad it<br/>
is.  Can&#39;t you ask them to stop breaking the rules so that they can keep<br/>
their accounts.  I&#39;ve seen people get booted from MMORPG&#39;s for breaking<br/>
site rules.  If you do it enough and what it is, they won&#39;t let you<br/>
back, depending on the site, my experience is with ToonTown.<br/>
<br/>
You, the mom, need to be playing with them and helping them navigate the<br/>
rules, then once they &quot;get&quot; it, play for fun and then go about your day<br/>
doing what you need to do and popping in here and there to see how they<br/>
are doing.<br/>
<br/>
Since computers and gaming has been regulated, it will take a while<br/>
before they get filled up on it.  They will though, and one day, they<br/>
won&#39;t play as much or in exclusion to all other things.  So, while they<br/>
are in the filling up mode, be sweet and kind about it, don&#39;t make them<br/>

ARE doing!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-63718571"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; So, in sum, with my daughter, I am worried she is going to get<br/>
&gt; into a cyber-stalker type of relationship, because if she is willing<br/>
&gt; to break rules, why wouldn&#39;t she break the rule against sharing<br/>
&gt; personal information? With my son, we&#39;ve already had one<br/>
&gt; computer destroyed by a virus and don&#39;t want to go there again.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Get better virus protection, put admin access only on his computer, or<br/>
his profile so that he can&#39;t download anything without the admin code. <br/>
It&#39;s a bit of a hassle, but it&#39;s totally worth it.  We did this with<br/>
Chamille&#39;s computer because she kept getting viruses.  She has the code<br/>
when she needs it, but now, at least she isn&#39;t downloading things on<br/>
accident, and she&#39;s a VERY capable user, she just uses sites sometimes<br/>
that are suspect.<br/>
<br/>
As far as your daughter goes... Do you think your daughter is looking<br/>
for an online relationship?  Has she given out addresses or phone<br/>
numbers?  Can she tell if she&#39;s playing with another kid?  We&#39;ve met<br/>
loads of people from online.  Chamille just spent the day on Saturday<br/>
with someone she met on myspace, a random add that ended up living very<br/>
nearby.  Chamille&#39;s been using online chat rooms and myspace and other<br/>
public forums since about the age of 10.  She&#39;s quite savvy about<br/>
knowing wether a person is on the up and up.  She&#39;s only had to block a<br/>
few people here and there and all of them were people her own age, who<br/>
for whatever reason, were doing mean cyber stalking.<br/>
<br/>
If a kid is willing to break rules, it doesn&#39;t mean they are going to<br/>
share personal information.  Give your kid some credit and assume she&#39;s<br/>
smart enough to not do that.  It seems kind of mean that you are<br/>
assuming that she&#39;s stupid enough or desperate enough to give out<br/>
personal info to strangers.  I&#39;ve met very very few kids that would do<br/>
that, and I know some pretty desperate teens.</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I used to (one or two years ago) resent the time they spent in front <br/>
of screens.  Then I thought about *why* I was feeling that way, and I <br/>
realized that it went back to my childhood, when my mother would<br/>
come home exhausted after 12-18 hours of work, and would not<br/>
want to deal with a child (me) and would go and de-stress in front<br/>
of the TV, making it very clear that I was not invited to watch along<br/>
with her, even.  Even if I just sat very quietly.  That made me so sad<br/>
that I had to see the sadness and let go of it so that I could look<br/>
at NOW and see that now is not the same as then  <br/>
<br/>
My kids are very happy to share their screen time with me.  It&#39;s a totally <br/>
different dynamic.  I just had to see it to be able to enjoy it.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; while they are in the filling up mode, be sweet and kind about it, <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I agree, and I *am* excited.  They are so much better at it than<br/>
I am, and so willing to give me help, so happy to help and happy<br/>
that I am asking for the help.  The gaming has been great for our<br/>
relationship.<br/>
<br/>
One thing though:  I am not convinced that they will definitely<br/>
get &quot;filled up&quot; and move on to other things.  And I don&#39;t mind<br/>
if they *don&#39;t*.  That&#39;s one fear I have been able to let go of.  Even<br/>
if they are lifelong avid gamers, that&#39;s cool with me.   I know a <br/>
couple of young people working in the gaming industry.  And<br/>
besides, I am also letting go of worrying about &quot;what will they<br/>
be when they grow up?&quot; in favor of enjoying who they are NOW. <br/>
<br/>
When I am not screwing it up, Unschooling really is making all our<br/>
lives so much happier and more peaceful!<br/>
<br/>
For example, where we live, we are surrounded by college students.  <br/>
So, our kids have a lot of opportunities to talk with older kids/young<br/>
adults, and they are very comfortable doing so.  They (my kids and <br/>
the college kids who live near us) share so many interests:  gaming, sci fi, <br/>
and Monty Python being just a few examples.  Then there are &quot;academic&quot;<br/>
interests (Shakespeare, physics, mechanical engineerig) that my kids and <br/>
the college kids share (not to mention professors; the kids are very comfortable <br/>
talking with adults, too... not aware that they are supposed to be in awe of the <br/>
Ph.D. or M.D. or whatever), and my kids are relieved to have people to talk about<br/>
that stuff with, because generally, the publicly schooled kids they know don&#39;t<br/>
want to talk about those sorts of things.  <br/>
<br/>
The college kids who don&#39;t know that my younger kids don&#39;t go to school <br/>
wonder how my kids know so much cool stuff.  They ask me, &quot;How did<br/>
you teach them that?&quot;  and I say, &quot;I didn&#39;t; they just learned it.&quot;  (Professors<br/>
also ask the same question and receive the same answer.)  The ones who <br/>
do know that my younger kids don&#39;t go to school say things like, &quot;Wow, when<br/>
I met you last fall, I thought you were kinda crazy not to send your kids to school, <br/>
but now I see that it&#39;s a really good idea!&quot;  Or they say, &quot;I wish I had had the <br/>
childhood they are having.&quot; A lot of them say that.  Most of them, actually.<br/>

I told him that writing things like that could get him banned and them all that he build and have achieved ( many he could never get again )until that day he would loose .<br/>
He does not want that to happen and has not done anything like that since them. He was not calling anyone names but writing them for fun since he now can.<br/>
Those would be real life consequences that maybe you kids are willing to take. Mine was not.<br/>
I was very matter of fact when I explained it to him  ( and had done it before ) that using those words can be funny and all but some people are offended by them and what could happen if he said/ wrote them in certain circumstances.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-402564376">How old is the daughter?  Is she a birth daughter?<br/>

Depending on her age, I think I&#39;d explain the reasons why.  If she seems to<br/>
be joking around, maybe she can make up some fake information to give out,<br/>
if asked?  I don&#39;t play these games, but it seems like if she&#39;s<br/>
chatting/talking that much about her real self, it would be hard to play the<br/>
game.<br/>
<br/>
What about having friends over, or going to friends&#39; houses?  Going to the<br/>

<br/>
  my daughter is the &quot;admin&quot; on her own laptop, so it provides her protection from &quot;trigger finger&quot; while still maintaining the &quot;hers-ness&quot; of her laptop and enabling her to develop the problem solving skills to determine what&#39;s &quot;ok&quot;.  she often asks my or my husband&#39;s opinion. <br/>
<br/>
  my son won&#39;t install anything without checking with us first, due to his cautious nature, so on the desktop he uses, the admin password is just to prevent accidental issues.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  i agree, but also think it can be helpful to talk about some REAL scenarios that can happen from small amounts of info, as i discovered a few years ago (didn&#39;t catch your daughter&#39;s age) that my now 14 year old didn&#39;t quite understand what info people could use to find out what other info, and what info might be safer, etc.  and also found it helpful to hear about how internet &quot;stalkers&quot; can fake very well - how just because an emails says it is from someone, how that might not be so, etc.  so some &quot;tour guiding&quot; to the nefarious world of internet predator behavior.    <br/>
<br/>
  my daughter would definitely break rules, but wouldn&#39;t give out personal info, now that she has that information.  she wants the information upon which to base her OWN decisions about what is safe and acceptable &quot;breakage of rules&quot; and what isn&#39;t.  and given that freedom, now she comes to me for advice.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Then it&#39;s not a problem?<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, there&#39;s no guarantee that unschooling will work for ANY  <br/>
family.  The factors are too varied.  And when people adopt, even when  <br/>
they adopt infants, there are factors the parents may never understand  <br/>
at all.  So it&#39;s probably worth remining people occasionally that the  <br/>
kids you&#39;re talking about were adopted, neglected, whatever, so they  <br/>
won&#39;t think that longtime unschoolers with their biological parents  <br/>
will be having those behaviors and attitudes.<br/>
<br/>
I realize it&#39;s politically correct to pretend there&#39;s no difference  <br/>
between adoptive relationships and biological relationships, but we  <br/>
can&#39;t help people unschool if we&#39;re not honest about real factors.   <br/>
And if people who read the list are unaware that a mom is talking  <br/>
about adopted kids or kids who haven&#39;t even yet really begun to be  <br/>
unschooling, the list becomes a frightening confusing place.<br/>
<br/>
Please, everyone, when there are unusual factors, let it be known  <br/>

  Why would a happy child want to leave the house? A child who wanted <br/>
  to leave the house doesn&#39;t need an internet predator to help them out.<br/>

  yes of course, i am sorry i didn&#39;t make that clear.  i was combining the &quot;i will use the computer whenever i want&quot; type sentiments, and the adoption, along with the recent conversion to unschooling with the possible desireability of leaving the house.  although, it is conceivable that a predator could find out where someone lives, or that a child/teen could be sufficiently trusting and adventuresome, and naive, to not view it as escaping an oppressive environment but as venturing out to experience something.<br/>

you ease into it. Say yes more. That doesn&#39;t mean say yes to anything <br/>
and everything.<br/>

&gt; Honestly, there&#39;s no guarantee that unschooling will work for ANY  <br/>
&gt; family.  The factors are too varied.  And when people adopt, even when  <br/>
&gt; they adopt infants, there are factors the parents may never understand  <br/>
&gt; at all.  So it&#39;s probably worth remining people occasionally that the  <br/>
&gt; kids you&#39;re talking about were adopted, neglected, whatever, so they  <br/>
&gt; won&#39;t think that longtime unschoolers with their biological parents  <br/>
&gt; will be having those behaviors and attitudes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I realize it&#39;s politically correct to pretend there&#39;s no difference  <br/>
&gt; between adoptive relationships and biological relationships, but we  <br/>
&gt; can&#39;t help people unschool if we&#39;re not honest about real factors.   <br/>
&gt; And if people who read the list are unaware that a mom is talking  <br/>
&gt; about adopted kids or kids who haven&#39;t even yet really begun to be  <br/>
&gt; unschooling, the list becomes a frightening confusing place.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please, everyone, when there are unusual factors, let it be known  <br/>
&gt; within your story.  Unschooling isn&#39;t magic.  Unschooling is difficult  <br/>
&gt; at first under the best of circumstances, and it might be impossible  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Two of our children were adopted as well, they were lucky, in their life prior to coming to us they were loved but the trauma of adoption is significant, even to a baby.  Our kids were 2 and 4.  I think unschooling them has looked a little different than our biological kids and will continue to evolve.  I see it as a process, just as attachment is a process.  These kids have a tendancy to have a very significant need to control their own lives because of their trauma and  this can be challenging. Not that the control in itself is bad but they see all sorts of things as a challenge to their control. They have alot of fears that sometimes dont seem to make sence. <br/>
With your son, I would help him when I could and let him know that he is welcome to play and you will help him when you can.  <br/>
Not just stupid people or people treated like they are stupid give out way too much information on the internet.  I think desperate/confused people do.  Try to watch your daughter as much as possible.  Her situation isnt a typical one.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1390065265"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; i agree, but also think it can be helpful to talk about some REAL<br/>
 </span></blockquote>scenarios that can happen from small amounts of info, as i discovered a<br/>
few years ago (didn&#39;t catch your daughter&#39;s age) that my now 14 year old<br/>
didn&#39;t quite understand what info people could use to find out what<br/>
other info, and what info might be safer, etc. and also found it helpful<br/>
to hear about how internet &quot;stalkers&quot; can fake very well - how just<br/>
because an emails says it is from someone, how that might not be so,<br/>
etc. so some &quot;tour guiding&quot; to the nefarious world of internet predator<br/>
behavior. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One way that Chamille learned all this, was by doing it herself.  She&#39;d<br/>
be snooping and scooping for info and taking traces of info, and we&#39;d do<br/>
a bit of research together to find out more info on someone.  Since, we<br/>
did it, she knew what kind of info might be too much info.  It was<br/>
harmless fun on our part, but it did provide insight as to what people<br/>
can find out about you from little things you say.<br/>
<br/>
However, I&#39;m not afraid of internet stalkers, and neither is Chamille. <br/>
Even if someone finds out where you live and what your real name is, it<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean they are some psycho killer that&#39;s going to come and get<br/>
you.  In fact, there really aren&#39;t many psycho killers out there in the<br/>
world, except in TV and movie land.  Chamille has no interest whatsoever<br/>
in meeting a random stranger at the local 7-11 store.  Everytime she&#39;s<br/>
wanted to meet someone in real life, that she&#39;s met online, she always<br/>
wants me, or a group of people to go with her.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve met many people online.  Everyone has been who they said they<br/>
were.  Chamille wouldn&#39;t even know her boyfriend if it weren&#39;t for the<br/>
internet, since she met his best friend online in Gaia over a year ago<br/>
and has been talking to him through myspace all this time.  They were<br/>
virtual internet strangers, yet they became friends and ended up meeting<br/>
each other in another weird connected coincidental way.  We live very<br/>
close to all of them.  They live close enough to skateboard to our<br/>
house.<br/>
<br/>
Sharing personal info isn&#39;t an all or nothing thing either.  It&#39;s a case<br/>
by case thing, and a get a feel for it thing, and a talk to your parents<br/>
and keep communication open kind of thing.  Chamille isn&#39;t afraid to say<br/>
to me, &quot;hey mom, I met someone online and I want to meet them in real<br/>
life, help me set it up.&quot;  And, I do.  Chamille has plenty of friends<br/>
who&#39;s parents are completely freaked out about internet stranger danger<br/>
and give a blanket &quot;no&quot; for all internet strangers.  It hasn&#39;t stopped<br/>
any of them from meeting internet strangers, they just do it without<br/>
their parents knowing and without sharing personal info.</div>

radar. The parents who are saying no to their kids, who are setting  <br/>
up roadblocks between them and what they want are creating needy kids.<br/>
<br/>
If the child is confident the parent will say &quot;Let&#39;s see how we can  <br/>
make that happen,&quot; when they ask for something, there&#39;s no reason to  <br/>
be looking for strangers who will say that.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We&#39;ve met many people online. Everyone has been who they said they<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve met most of the unschoolers I know through the internet. :-)  <br/>
And, as Jenny said, they&#39;ve all been who they spent a long time  <br/>
showing who they were.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter has made the best friends through the internet because  <br/>
she can connect authentically through interests on sites like  <br/>
Deviantart and Subeta. She and they share who they are and what they  <br/>
love. It feels totally different than interacting with someone who is  <br/>
using an interest to find something else. (And why there are many  <br/>
stories of people who found their future spouse when they stopped  <br/>
looking for a spouse and just started living :-)<br/>
<br/>
Kathryn&#39;s been to Texas and Michigan and even Poland to visit girls  <br/>
she&#39;s met on the internet. (And don&#39;t even think it was easy to find  <br/>
a way to say yes to sending a 16 yo on her own to Poland! But it was  <br/>
well worth it for my husband and I to push past our fears and the  <br/>
cheapest 10 day immersion in another culture one could get :-) She  <br/>
even missed her flight from London to Warsaw (as did several people)  <br/>
and handled it with aplomb while the woman next to her in line had a  <br/>
breakdown. That&#39;s not something you can teach someone. But it is  <br/>
something they can learn through making decisions from the time  <br/>
they&#39;re small.<br/>
