<div id="ygrps-yiv-154893563">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Boy do I know what you are talking about Ticia. My Riley is that boy at the park. Explosive, hurtful, uncontrollable. We leave the park alot. Talking to the mom may help, but she is most likely totally overwhelmed with her kids behavior that she may not be able to help him as effectively as you protect your own child. I have found that playing with the kids a big game of tag, hide and seek or other large game dispels the bad energy my child can get. He simply does not get along with everyone and I tend to not take him places he will explode. He is going on 7 now and is getting so much better about his control of his feelings.<br/>
<br/>
 My sister has a 5 year old who she is constantly ingoring to lecture the other victims. A sample. 5year old shrieks, she hit me. Turns out 5 year old has been pinning other persons arm down so she can keep a toy, eventually ending in hitting 5 year old off. Yet the shriek scream gets her own moms signals going oh, my child has been hit and my own arm pinned kid gets a long lecture in sharing and not hitting. Point totally missed that her kid did the wrong to get the hit. I hawk eye the kids now constantly. When Shawn starts her I going to get you by hurting you, I pick her up and give her to her mom. Shawn does not like getting caught or told she is wrong. I have watched Shawn since she was 18 months pushing, hitting, bitting. Her mom still does not get it that Shawn is dangerous to other kids and needs to be stopped. I miss out on alot of adult time because I am watching the kids. My own 4 year old loves her cousin, so my job is to keep them both save. My sis still will let all the kids, 3,4,5,6,9 all pile into a room together without an adult and guess what. Shawn always winds up hurting some one. Now put her and Riley together, you will see fireworks. Watch the elbows push eachother as they try to be first in line. I keep Riley away from her as much as I can to keep him cool. We just spent time together and I can not believe how worked up Riley gets around his cousin.<br/>
<br/>
So my point. Watch and protect your own kids. They are number 1 for you. Help the little guy out by bringing him to his mom or stopping him as he starts hurting. Make it clear to the group that people have a right to be safe from harm and make a point to let the boy know you will stop him until he can stop himself. Tessa is up, got to go.<br/>
