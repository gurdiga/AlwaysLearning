This is a absurd oxymoron.  Abusive parents are living by the biblical<br/>
dictate &quot;spare the rod and spoil the child.&quot;   To use &quot;honor thy mother<br/>
and father&quot; to justify abuse hardly came from the mouth of Jesus.<br/>

Bill, I think you read too quickly.  Deb said &quot;...it could be argued  <br/>
that avoiding contact with an abusive parent is...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, this is important for everyone here to know:<br/>
<br/>
==================<br/>
<br/>
**I assume you&#39;re talking about &quot;spare the rod, spoil the child&quot;**<br/>
<br/>
And that line isn&#39;t even from the Bible.<br/>

Yes. The actual quote is as follows: &quot;He who spareth the rod hateth his son: <br/>
but he that loveth him correcteth him betimes&quot; (Proverbs 13:24) and &quot;Withhold <br/>
not correction from a child: for if thou strike him with the rod, he shall not <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1068180488">I have been trying to lose weight also. I just put this book on hold at the library. Any other books or advice or suggestions would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
My son (the one who makes everything a game) has become my fitness coach and we is taking me on fitness walks and is supporting me in not eating too much. I have lost a few pounds with his help. It is a total hoot to hear my 9 year old telling me how to eat in a healthy manner. I had no clue that he knew so much about nutrition. I have always been very into eating a really healthy diet (I just eat too much of a healthy diet) but he has picked up more info than some nutritionists. Binging on healthy foods and not getting enough exercise are my problems. No treats or desserts for me unless I work them off these days. I only need to lose about 15-20 pounds but having his help is great. He is also the reason that is impossible for me to go exercise whenever I want. I can see that enlisting his support will make it much easier for me than trying to go off and do it on my own. My favorite exercise is walking or hiking and I can only do that with him or when my husband can watch him.<br/>

I read a book called When Women Stop Hating Their Bodies, http:// <br/>
www.overcomingovereating.com/WWSHTB.html<br/>
<br/>
I really got a lot out of it, and it has helped me find new ways to  <br/>
talk to myself about my body and think about myself. I also think  <br/>
that its totally compatible with unschooly ideas. I think one of the  <br/>
authors also has cowritten a great book about kids eating,<br/>
How To Avoid Childhood Eating Problems. Also, very very good  <br/>
(although I dont agree with some of their statements about extended  <br/>
breastfeeding).<br/>

<br/>
Life was easier before anyone thought about &quot;decisions.&quot;  People were  <br/>
told how to act and they complied, whether they were peasants, serfs,  <br/>
slaves or kings.  And religions grew up around it all to tell them to  <br/>
do their duty for God or else.<br/>
<br/>
Those who were alive and cognizant in the 1970&#39;s saw a lot of things  <br/>
change with women&#39;s rights.  People Holly&#39;s age would be appalled at  <br/>
some of what was going on then with laws and beliefs and assumptions.<br/>
<br/>
But with all that, you get choices, and you have to decide what to  <br/>
think.  And it IS harder than just going with the sludgy old flow,  <br/>
sometimes.<br/>
