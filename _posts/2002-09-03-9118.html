traumatic, it probably wouldn&#39;t have been on vegetarian grounds.<br/>

I got free AOL for a while volunteering on the Homework Help area, in the <br/>
English section. I was often amazed by the STUPID assignments the kids would <br/>
get.Many involved dissecting works that were perfectly fine without being <br/>
dissected, thank you.<br/>
