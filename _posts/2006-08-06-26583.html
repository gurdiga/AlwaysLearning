<div id="ygrps-yiv-1146863541">&quot;I believe it effects the brain in an unknown<br/>
possibly dangerous way. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not trying to be disrespectful, please don&#39;t take it that way, but<br/>
I laughed out loud on this!! I have four children, ages 16.5, almost<br/>
13 (in 3 weeks), 9 and 5. <br/>
<br/>
All of them are amazing, creative, interesting and intelligent human<br/>
beings. My oldest could fix your computer (or build you one) if you<br/>
have problems. They&#39;re artists and dreamers and thinkers...all of them.<br/>
<br/>
I see NO detrimental effects from television yet. They all have tv in<br/>
their rooms. They have all the video game systems other than the newer<br/>
Playstation and Xbox (too expensive right now). They have unlimited<br/>
access to computers. <br/>
<br/>
All the worry is wasted. The only thing tv has done around here is<br/>
provide a jumping off point to interesting, swirly conversations,<br/>
sparked debates and loads of great dress-up and acting.<br/>
In short, it facilitates learning of all kinds. So do a lot of other<br/>
things in our lives. Tv isn&#39;t evil....really.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1608691983">&quot;Are these researchers and reporters just deeply full of shit? Do<br/>
they really think it&#39;s worth noting that interesting or exciting<br/>
things make your heart beat faster, while relaxing and soothing<br/>
things make your heartrate slow down?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You know what gets me? The &quot;evidence&quot; of how your brain waves are a<br/>
certain way while watching television (is it more alpha?).<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo, does that make mediation, or reading just as harmful, &#39;cuz I<br/>
sure as hell get PASSIVE in that state! Just because it causes<br/>
different brain waves, does NOT mean it&#39;s a negative thing. We need to<br/>
use our brains in all different states. duh.<br/>

<br/>
That was written by someone who once did consider TV to be evil or at  <br/>
least an irritant to be avoided.<br/>
