<div id="ygrps-yiv-1125953333">I just had to chime in on the pets theme. <br/>
We don&#39;t have nearly as many as all of you though. <br/>
We have 2 dogs and a cat. One of the dogs and the cat came <br/>
with us from the UK. Smudge is a jack russell/border collie <br/>
cross. Apple is a black domestic shorhair (cat). Our newest <br/>
family member is Angel, a lab/retreiver cross. Smudge is the <br/>
smartest one of the lot, and has a wonderful personality. Angel is <br/>
a big dufus, but the sweetest thing on four legs. And Apple&#39;s a <br/>
snuggler (as long as he knows you well enough!). <br/>
We tried to adopt a stray cat when we first moved in, but Apple <br/>
was so neurotic and evil to the newcomer that a neighbour very <br/>
kindly took her instead. So I guess we won&#39;t be having any more <br/>
cats. I think Apple has species confusion anyway, he&#39;s far more <br/>
accepting of new dogs &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s funny. A few different friends have suggested that I train <br/>
Smudge for agility. He&#39;s super fast, can catch a ball or frisbee <br/>
mid-air, can jump straight up in the air about 4 1/2 to 5 feet and <br/>
can clear 6 feet at a full run (which makes him an excellent <br/>
escape artist! At least he always comes home &lt;g&gt;). I just can&#39;t <br/>
imagine finding the time to do all that training.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-521620601">Well, I am a dog lover and Nanci is a cat lover.  Nanci and the boys have<br/>
just moved onto a 39 acre farm on the Olympic penensula and we can finally<br/>
get a dog or two.  Because of the field mice, we got an outdoor cat.  She<br/>
was fully grown and already living outside, so the only change was acres<br/>
of mice to chase.  She is loving it.<br/>
<br/>
We went to the Humane Society and got a 6 moth Black Lab mix.  I warned<br/>
Nanci that labs love to chew and she got plenty of chew toys.  The<br/>
advantagious side effect is that the boys will now clean up their toys. <br/>
We warned them the dog would &quot;play&quot; with them and chew them up.  Well,<br/>
after about 6 toy casualties, they boys are incredably good at picking up<br/>
their toys now and pay attention to what Ketch (dogs name) is playing with<br/>
for any toy rescue missions.<br/>
<br/>
If I had known all it took was a dog to get the boys to pick up their toys<br/>
regularly, I would have gotten one years ago.  This has also started<br/>
solving our problem as to which toys to get rid of as we think our boys<br/>
just have too many.  Ketch seems to be sorting out that problem for us.<br/>

watched agility trials together, but she&#39;s not interested. Maybe <br/>
she get into when she&#39;s a bit older, who knows?<br/>

in a year and a half). Our pup (she just turned 1 year old) is a <br/>
chewer, digger and all round destructo machine. She&#39;s even <br/>
managed to take some of the wood siding off the back of the <br/>
house! There are several theories about her origins. All are <br/>
agreed that she&#39;s got lab in her. The other possibilities are <br/>
retriever or border collie. Personally, I think she&#39;s a bit too dim to <br/>
have any collie in her.  She&#39;s got such a pea brain, and such a <br/>
big, soppy heart.<br/>
