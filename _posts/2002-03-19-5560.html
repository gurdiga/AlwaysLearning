<div id="ygrps-yiv-1346937737">Either people aren&#39;t posting or I&#39;m not getting yahoo mail yet.  <br/>
<br/>
I rejoined the other list.  I&#39;m not going to stay to the point of abuse.  But <br/>
even that list isn&#39;t coming in but a trickle.<br/>
<br/>
It could be AOL has so much backed up yahoo mail it&#39;s going to be a while, or <br/>
maybe we just won&#39;t get the older stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Kirby cleaned his room!!!  Well, he did a really thorough cleaning of one end <br/>
of it anyway.  He&#39;s buying a computer with his own money, and has cleaned out <br/>
the area where he&#39;s going to put it.  Vacuumed, brought me stuff to give to <br/>
charity, got me to help him find a good place to put the big box of Ninja <br/>
Turtle figures, traded his long phone cord for a shorter one (he&#39;s decided to <br/>
just leave the computer plugged into the phone line and not have a telephone <br/>
in there).  <br/>
<br/>
This one was NOT my idea.  I knew he had room for it without a big clean, <br/>
because I had done some big cleaning before Christmas so he&#39;d have room for <br/>
the gamecube he didn&#39;t know he was getting.  His dad put in shelves, and I <br/>
organized about half of his stuff (at his request, because he was not <br/>
fathoming how it could be done).  <br/>
<br/>
So for hours, yesterday, he was cleaning happily, merrily!  Having fun!<br/>
<br/>
How cool.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well I joined the other list too and have been getting plenty of mail from <br/>
it. (I personally posted way too much yesterday.) I was glad to see you were <br/>
there also. :o)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How pleasant for all of you! Conor cleaned his room in that fashion when he <br/>
first got his guinea pig. He wanted it cleared out so the pig could run <br/>
around. I recently did a total overhaul on his room to ready it for selling. <br/>
(I got Conor&#39;s permission to really get in there.) He was so pleased with <br/>
the results that he was almost floating on air. He thanked me even. <br/>
Repeatedly.<br/>
