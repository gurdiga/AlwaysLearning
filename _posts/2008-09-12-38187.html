<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve written that I remember Holt having said, but I don&#39;t know  <br/>
where.  Every few years I&#39;ve asked, as you did, where it came from.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t just about reading, though.  It was that EVERYthing they  <br/>
teach in public school can be learned by a teen in 18 months.  And  <br/>
think about it... high school or college students who come here from  <br/>
countries with a completely different system of writing and a  <br/>
different culture can be academically &quot;up to speed&quot; in a  year or two.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If someone moves to an English-speaking country from Spain or Italy  <br/>
and learns English well enough to take college courses, that&#39;s not as  <br/>
impressive as someone who comes from China or Japan or India and has  <br/>
to learn a whole  new system of writing (well, college-prepped kids  <br/>
from India probably could read English, at least, if not write  <br/>
cursively, and increasingly  kids from China are learning English).    <br/>
But my point is that even someone who comes from a different culture  <br/>
who has to learn to read our writing and to write it down, to spell  <br/>
passably, and to write legibly, learns it within a year or two.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How much more easily could a native English speaker who has no  <br/>
culture shock to overcome (knows how to use the bathroom plumbing and  <br/>
to order in a restaurant already; knows how to buy food at the store  <br/>
already) pick up all the details of how to write mathematical  <br/>
notation and to punctuate?   And enough history and geography to  <br/>
follow the news is EASY to pick up if you&#39;re from that culture, but  <br/>
those from other cultures do pretty well at it too.<br/>

Thanks, Sandra. I also thought Holt, but can&#39;t figure out where to<br/>
find it. No biggie.  I realize he was talking about all learning, not<br/>
just reading.  My friend is particularly concerned about the reading<br/>
(and now math) aspect of things.  <br/>
<br/>
I realized recently that I was giving this person advice that wasn&#39;t<br/>
true to me, because I was making allowance for his academic fears. <br/>
Instead, I offered him the same advice I&#39;d offer anyone asking about<br/>
unschooling -- forget the academics and live full lives with your<br/>
kids. Everything is connected and it all counts.  Besides, all the<br/>
academics in the world won&#39;t help his kids live &#39;happy and functional<br/>
lives&#39; (his stated goal) if their entire structure is built on head<br/>
games (currently it is).  Quit worrying about how to school them, and<br/>
focus on how to live with them.  I recommended Rue&#39;s books and a<br/>
couple of others and left it at that. <br/>
<br/>
I thought I remembered my question as one that was regularly asked,<br/>
with no answer.  The lack of an answer was a good reminder that<br/>
empirical evidence someday isn&#39;t the point -- full, happy lives today<br/>
is the point of it all.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I recall hearing the story thus:<br/>
<br/>
A group of middle- to high school students at an alternative, unschool- <br/>
ish school -- Sudbury Valley, or maybe the English equivalent? --  <br/>
asked the staff to teach them math.  They wanted to have the same  <br/>
education as the other schools.  The staff said fine, but you must  <br/>
agree to do what we say -- no whining at homework, quizzes, tests.   <br/>
The students agreed.  It took a very short time -- I recall it as six  <br/>
months -- to teach all the kids all the math they would have learned  <br/>
in 12 years of school.<br/>
<br/>
I *think* I heard this story, rather than read it, at a conference.  I  <br/>
do not recall which conference, whether a homeschool one or another (I  <br/>
attended a L&#39;Abri conference in the mid &#39;80&#39;s, where I was introduced  <br/>
to the idea of homeschooling, by speakers, by a book called &quot;For the  <br/>
Children&#39;s Sake,&quot; and by a homeschooled boy who carried on a polite,  <br/>
intelligent discussion with my dh about the night sky.  We had not had  <br/>
any children yet, and the idea of being able to homeschool them helped  <br/>
sway us in the direction of parenthood.  I also attended a Rutherford  <br/>
Conference.  Boy, have I come a long way!)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also possible it was featured in the book, &quot;Family Matters: Why  <br/>
Homeschooling Makes Sense,&quot; by David Guterson.  I know the story is  <br/>
familiar to me from *way* back in my awareness of homeschooling, and  <br/>
that was one of the few books my local library stocked at the time.<br/>
<br/>
I wish my nearly-50 y.o. brain was a bit sharper on the recall, but I  <br/>
have an excuse today -- I&#39;m taking some pain and muscle-relaxant drugs  <br/>
to help my very stiff and sore back; Wednesday, I took a very hard  <br/>
fall off my new horse ;-)<br/>

&gt; Pokemon/TCG day, board games, special film series (like Harry Potter),<br/>
&gt; craft day (my kids have loved carving soap ...Ivory is the best!), stamping<br/>
&gt; (they made their own stamps the other night with an artist friend of<br/>
&gt; ours....and loved it!), how to build a campfire in the winter, birding,<br/>
&gt; chess tournament.<br/>
&gt; All for now! I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll think of more later.....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-740475357">You could make cardboard box ovens and bake bread in them. (These are  <br/>
charcoal, not solar, and really easy to be successful.)<br/>
Or you could make solar ovens out of pringles chips containers and  <br/>
cook hot dogs in them.<br/>
<br/>
Soda bottle rockets are always a HUGE hit.<br/>
<br/>
Bead stringing - sounds like a young children activity, but my  <br/>
experience is that if you put out lots of variety of small beads, the  <br/>
teens will really enjoy making their own patterns, stringing them into  <br/>
necklaces - boys, too. I was reminded of this because I just saw an  <br/>
article about David Beckham (you know, British soccer player married  <br/>
to a spice girl - now plays for LA Galaxy) wearing beads that are  <br/>
supposed to improve his sex life &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; thanks - love the soap carving idea...  oh, and candle making!  i  <br/>
&gt; just thought of that...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Soap carving is pretty hard - and quite a mess, so plan ahead. In  <br/>
fact, try it yourself first to get a feeling for what to expect. Maybe  <br/>
certain kinds of soap work better than others. Consider what carving  <br/>
tools you&#39;ll have for people to use, too.<br/>
<br/>
A fun candlemaking activity is to dip water balloons. Fill them with a  <br/>
little water - maybe half a cup or a little more. Dip them into the  <br/>
melted wax, let cool for a few seconds, dip again, cool, dip again.  <br/>
Just dip the bottom (water filled) of the balloon about an inch or two  <br/>
into the wax. After you&#39;ve got a nice thick layer of wax on the  <br/>
balloon, let it cool thoroughly and then pop the balloon. It makes a  <br/>
lovely candle holder - put one of your regular dipped candles into it  <br/>
or buy a box full of votive or just tea candles to drop in. You can  <br/>
dip the edges in warm water and smooth them with your fingers.<br/>
<br/>
We have done a lot of candle making, over the years, and this is a  <br/>
real favorite.<br/>
<br/>
To do regular dipped candles, everybody stand in line and take turns -  <br/>
first dip into the melted wax, then into a bucket of water. Then walk  <br/>
around to the end of the line and by the time they get back to the  <br/>
beginning, it is time to dip again. Dipping into the water after they  <br/>
dip into the wax helps prevent them from dripping wax all over the  <br/>
place. Remind them to dip straight down and straight up and let it  <br/>
drip just a bit back into the melted wax.<br/>
<br/>
The results are best if they just dip in and out - don&#39;t hold it in  <br/>
the wax.<br/>
<br/>
You can use paraffin wax - if you add at least a bit of beeswax  <br/>
(expensive) it is very nice. You also need to add some stearic acid to  <br/>
make the candles burn really well. You can buy colored wax cubes to  <br/>
make the color - people always say you can add shaved crayons, but  <br/>
that doesn&#39;t give a nice uniform color, it is grainy.<br/>
<br/>
Another fun thing to do is buy up a bunch of different kinds of  <br/>
containers at thrift stores and pour wax into them. Tie a little flat  <br/>
washer to the wicking to weigh it down and keep it centered at the  <br/>
bottom of the container and tie the top around a pencil that sits  <br/>
across the top of the container, to keep the wicking upright. After  <br/>
you&#39;ve poured and it has cooled down enough to hold it by the pencil/ <br/>
wick, you can dip the entire container just like dipping a candle, so  <br/>
that when it burns, it burns down the inside of the container and  <br/>
leaves the wax on the outside. You can use different colors - the  <br/>
candle light will shine through the exterior wax - really pretty.<br/>
<br/>
Also you can dip a little and then press flower petals or leaves or  <br/>
other flatish things into the wax and then dip a little over them.<br/>

We&#39;ve never used anything too sharp, although I&#39;m sure there are tools made just for this purpose.  We&#39;ve had great luck with the wooden &quot;orange sticks&quot; for manicures.  Easy to grip and use, even for little ones.  I suppose you could use other small tools, but we just happened to have some orange sticks and they worked great!  (P.S.  Soap makes a great holiday gift, and it&#39;s so fun for the kids to carve!)  Here&#39;s the Ivory web site <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ivory.com/PureFun_IvoryProjects_SoapCarvingTips.htm">http://www.ivory.com/PureFun_IvoryProjects_SoapCarvingTips.htm</a><br/>
(and they mention something to catch the soap...we used big plastic serving trays and they worked well my two youngers had fun cleaning off the trays and turning everything into bubbles when they were finished!)<br/>
Have fun!<br/>

<br/>
My kids are younger than yours, but here are some things I remember<br/>
enjoying from when I was a child or things that I enjoy now.<br/>
<br/>
Your cookie idea reminded me how much fun it is to make your own<br/>
custom calzones and mini-pizzas.<br/>
<br/>
I remember making wontons and egg rolls with my family (5 kids) and<br/>
that was fun. Very yummy! Donuts are another fun thing to make,<br/>
while you are deep frying. I think you could do plain donuts first<br/>
and then the wontons and eggrolls... I think you would get strange<br/>
flavors in the donuts if you did it in the other order, but it might<br/>
be fun to experiment with that as well.<br/>
<br/>
Candy making: Homemade caramel is amazing.... but that might not be a<br/>
group activity. I remember making chocolates in chocolate molds a<br/>
child. Caramels dipped in chocolates.. . combined w/nuts... lots of<br/>
options and it might work well for a group.<br/>
<br/>
Projects with wood, nails & glue.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to have to try soap carving! What tools do you use to carve the soap?<br/>

<br/>
specifically, we are having trouble finding common ground amongst the kids in our group of unschooling friends - so the open ended, &quot;just go play&quot; type stuff doesn&#39;t always work great, and thus i am looking for some itneresting projects to use as bonding/exploring springboards..<br/>

  You could make cardboard box ovens and bake bread in them. (These are <br/>
  charcoal, not solar, and really easy to be successful.)<br/>
  Or you could make solar ovens out of pringles chips containers and <br/>
  cook hot dogs in them.<br/>

  Bead stringing - sounds like a young children activity, but my <br/>
  experience is that if you put out lots of variety of small beads, the <br/>
  teens will really enjoy making their own patterns, stringing them into <br/>
  necklaces - boys, too. I was reminded of this because I just saw an <br/>
  article about David Beckham (you know, British soccer player married <br/>
  to a spice girl - now plays for LA Galaxy) wearing beads that are <br/>
  supposed to improve his sex life &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; thanks - love the soap carving idea... oh, and candle making! i <br/>
  &gt; just thought of that...<br/>
<br/>
  Soap carving is pretty hard - and quite a mess, so plan ahead. In <br/>
  fact, try it yourself first to get a feeling for what to expect. Maybe <br/>
  certain kinds of soap work better than others. Consider what carving <br/>
  tools you&#39;ll have for people to use, too.<br/>
<br/>
  A fun candlemaking activity is to dip water balloons. Fill them with a <br/>
  little water - maybe half a cup or a little more. Dip them into the <br/>
  melted wax, let cool for a few seconds, dip again, cool, dip again. <br/>
  Just dip the bottom (water filled) of the balloon about an inch or two <br/>
  into the wax. After you&#39;ve got a nice thick layer of wax on the <br/>
  balloon, let it cool thoroughly and then pop the balloon. It makes a <br/>
  lovely candle holder - put one of your regular dipped candles into it <br/>
  or buy a box full of votive or just tea candles to drop in. You can <br/>
  dip the edges in warm water and smooth them with your fingers.<br/>
<br/>
  We have done a lot of candle making, over the years, and this is a <br/>
  real favorite.<br/>
<br/>
  To do regular dipped candles, everybody stand in line and take turns - <br/>
  first dip into the melted wax, then into a bucket of water. Then walk <br/>
  around to the end of the line and by the time they get back to the <br/>
  beginning, it is time to dip again. Dipping into the water after they <br/>
  dip into the wax helps prevent them from dripping wax all over the <br/>
  place. Remind them to dip straight down and straight up and let it <br/>
  drip just a bit back into the melted wax.<br/>
<br/>
  The results are best if they just dip in and out - don&#39;t hold it in <br/>
  the wax.<br/>
<br/>
  You can use paraffin wax - if you add at least a bit of beeswax <br/>
  (expensive) it is very nice. You also need to add some stearic acid to <br/>
  make the candles burn really well. You can buy colored wax cubes to <br/>
  make the color - people always say you can add shaved crayons, but <br/>
  that doesn&#39;t give a nice uniform color, it is grainy.<br/>
<br/>
  Another fun thing to do is buy up a bunch of different kinds of <br/>
  containers at thrift stores and pour wax into them. Tie a little flat <br/>
  washer to the wicking to weigh it down and keep it centered at the <br/>
  bottom of the container and tie the top around a pencil that sits <br/>
  across the top of the container, to keep the wicking upright. After <br/>
  you&#39;ve poured and it has cooled down enough to hold it by the pencil/ <br/>
  wick, you can dip the entire container just like dipping a candle, so <br/>
  that when it burns, it burns down the inside of the container and <br/>
  leaves the wax on the outside. You can use different colors - the <br/>
  candle light will shine through the exterior wax - really pretty.<br/>
<br/>
  Also you can dip a little and then press flower petals or leaves or <br/>
  other flatish things into the wax and then dip a little over them.<br/>

A few years ago, I was at a used sports store. I got a really good deal <br/>
on an almost new crochet set and a brand-new, never-out-of-the-box <br/>
badmitton set. Haven&#39;t ever used either! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I should bring them out when it cools off here this fall. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Both, new, are still pretty cheap entertainment!<br/>
