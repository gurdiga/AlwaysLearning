<div id="ygrps-yiv-871122436">-=- Forget about trying to change or educate anybody. Take  <br/>
responsibility to do what you want to do. If you think the toilet is  <br/>
dirty and you want to wash the toilet and it is the tenth time in a  <br/>
row that you have washed the toilet and no one else washes it, so  <br/>
what?! Take responsibility that you wash the toilet this time because  <br/>
you want to. Then you experience the power and dignity from your  <br/>
actions. If your attitude sucks, your life will never be fair! And  <br/>
love will forever evade you.-=-<br/>

This was written by Clinton Callahan, an American living and working  <br/>
in Germany since 1996.  It&#39;s in an article about single mothers  <br/>
creating a &quot;mommy village,&quot; but it&#39;s not online.<br/>
<br/>
He has one article online about parents and children being partners.   <br/>
His two daughters were homeschooled (sounds pretty unschoolish) and  <br/>
are both taking university classes in France now, studying to become  <br/>
state-licensed riding instructors..  He and his wife recently  <br/>
divorced.  He trains trainers in Germany, and the program is based on  <br/>
some of the kinds of things he&#39;s written about parents and children,  <br/>
too, and whether he learned it from management training and applied  <br/>
it to children or the other way, I don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
The article<br/>
PARENTS AND CHILDREN ARE NATURAL ENEMIES<br/>
ABOUT THE CONFLICT OF AUTHORITY AND THE POSSIBILITY OF GETTING<br/>
ON THE SAME TEAM WITH YOUR CHILDREN<br/>
<br/>
is here:<br/>

There was only about one sentence in that at which I balked a bit.   <br/>
His writing is good.  He&#39;s involved in possibilities and &quot;wild  <br/>
thinking&quot; endeavors, and a lot of his thoughts are in directions  <br/>
we&#39;ve already gone.<br/>
<br/>
The bio from the article he attached (from which the first quote was  <br/>
taken:<br/>
<br/>
About the author: Clinton Callahan is fifty-two years old and moved  <br/>
with his wife Brindavan and their two horse-loving daughters from  <br/>
America to Europe in 1995.  The Callahan’s honeymoon was two-and-a- <br/>
half years of work and travel through the South Pacific and Asia. As  <br/>
a result of their cultural expansion their children were born at home  <br/>
in a family bed, and home-schooled their whole lives. Together  <br/>
Clinton and Brindavan present Conscious Childraising, a weekend  <br/>
seminar that gives families a new beginning, and Kingmaker,  <br/>
empowering women in a patriarchy. For more information visit www.p-m- <br/>

I get a fair amount of mail from people with similar interests who&#39;ve  <br/>
found my site, but this one was particularly interesting to me and it  <br/>
seemed a good one to share.<br/>
