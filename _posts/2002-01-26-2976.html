 </span></blockquote>Hi Dawn,<br/>
I had such a hard time with this.  No matter how much I love my family,<br/>
NO ONE seems good enough to care for my child!  Crazy.<br/>
We chose one of my sisters in law and her husband because when all was<br/>
said and done they have the greatest kids, happy and secure, and they&#39;re<br/>
very involved with them.  They don&#39;t homeschool, and weren&#39;t sure they<br/>
could homeschool Dylan.  Dylan,  after some consideration, thinks he&#39;d<br/>
want to be with someone who would homeschool, and we&#39;re now considering<br/>
my sister. <br/>
<br/>
The legal advise was, to explain in the will WHY we changed legal<br/>
guardians, so that no one could claim we simply made a mistake and that<br/>
the guardianship should be awarded to the previous choice.    Don&#39;t<br/>
forget about changing the beneficiaries of insurance policies, etc. when<br/>
you do this.   Ugh, I hated this, I always feel for anyone making these<br/>
choices.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-137602575">Not an expert but have heard conversations on this before. First off, it<br/>
is important to remember that putting down a guardian on a will is<br/>
considered a suggestion and can be easily challenged by a living<br/>
relative. Courts have the tendency to support blood relatives over non<br/>
relatives. So your best bet would be a blood relative who will support<br/>
your feelings on school, discipline, etc.<br/>

<br/>
We have wills that name my former sil (my brother&#39;s ex-wife) as guardian of <br/>
our kids. She and I have had many discussions and she thinks unschooling is <br/>
great. We&#39;re lucky in that way. But we did break some traditions to get <br/>
there. We didn&#39;t choose parents or siblings or any of the usual choices for <br/>
guardian. We even, technically, went outside the family in what could have <br/>
been a touchy situation. But we told everyone our reasons and we have enough <br/>
insurance to make sure my former sil/now best friend can stop working. It <br/>
brings me *some* peace of mind. Hard to think aobut this stuff, though.<br/>

That is a really tough one.<br/>
I am fortunate to have a homeschooling sis that respects my way of <br/>
doing things. She and I are very close and I know she&#39;d raise my kids <br/>
in a healthy manner.<br/>
I have to wonder about options in your case?<br/>
I mean which would be worse in the event that both of you should <br/>
die...to go to school, or be raised by someone they aren&#39;t as close <br/>
to as their Grandparents?<br/>
Are the children fairly close to them?<br/>
I think that would weigh heavily in my decision.<br/>
And chances are, you will live to be very old and raise your kids the <br/>
way you see fit. It&#39;s a good idea to think about and plan for this <br/>
possibility though.<br/>

<br/>
We have a friend assigned to be financial guardian, and one thing he&#39;s to do <br/>
is arrange for them to stay in the house, if possible, with someone who will <br/>
go along with the homeschooling if the kids still want to.<br/>
<br/>
As Kirby&#39;s nearly 16, the panic is somewhat off.  Their ages are centered <br/>
around 13 now.  When their ages were centered around five or six, I was truly <br/>
nervous.<br/>
<br/>
There are several adult friends who would be candidates for coming here to <br/>
live with the kids if it came to that.  We have several single friends who&#39;ve <br/>
known the kids since they were born.  But making inflexible deals now would <br/>
be rough.   It will be a matter of distribution of funds and an attempt to <br/>
maintain the freedom to which they&#39;ve become accustomed.<br/>

<br/>
If I die, from all I&#39;ve heard, Cacie&#39;s dad would get custody if he asked<br/>
for it. Even though he&#39;s an asshole who barely manages to keep his own<br/>
head above water, and has no legal rights now, although he&#39;s listed on<br/>
her birth certificate and the order or paternity. I think that sucks, and<br/>
have decided just to not die. <br/>
<br/>
I was also wanting to do some traveling out of the country in the next<br/>
year or so, and it&#39;s seeming like I&#39;d have to go to court to be able to<br/>
do that, because they require a notarized letter from the other parent<br/>
giving permission and no way would he do that. That also sucks.  A court<br/>
battle (and it would be a battle) would be messy, and we both have stuff<br/>
in our backgrounds that would make us look unfit.  But we want to go to<br/>
Australia, and Ireland, and France.... <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-552721082">Frankly I think it comes down to economics. Many siblings wouldn&#39;t<br/>
necessarily like more children either but the increase in funds is<br/>
attractive. Proving a point about spanking &quot;working&quot; or homeschooling<br/>
being a bunch of baloney can be another ego plus.<br/>

Can you tell I have five siblings? ;)<br/>

because he doesn&#39;t care what anyone thinks, except maybe Cacie and his<br/>
maybe oldest daughter. He thinks all my friends hate him anyway - they<br/>
don&#39;t, a couplre actually like him, but he&#39;s a touch paranoid. And of<br/>
course I don&#39;t want to put Cacie in the middle. I was thinking perhaps of<br/>
offering him a deal, he always talks about wanting to take her camping<br/>
and stuff, and if she wanted to do it maybe I could tell him that he<br/>
could if he wrote me this letter and had it notarized... I dunno. Kinda<br/>
iffy. Still thinking.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Really? Was this before or after 9-11, and what kind of<br/>
custodial-paternity documentation did you have? If you don&#39;t mind my<br/>
asking...? Legally they can bar your entry if you don&#39;t have a notarized<br/>
letter, because of possible custodial issues, and from what I&#39;ve heard<br/>
it&#39;s gotten harder since 9-11. Cacie&#39;s been to Mexico with me lots of<br/>
times, but only going within the free zone (100 miles of the border) and<br/>
we&#39;ve never been asked for anything (although last time they did thump<br/>
the car a lot more on the US inspection). We flew to Canada twice, when<br/>
she was 7 months okd no one asked anything, but when she was 3  we had a<br/>
big hassle, where they pulled us off into a little room and tried to ask<br/>
her questions... it went like this:<br/>
<br/>
Customs Agent: (looking at birth certificate) What&#39;s your name?<br/>
<br/>
Cacie: Cacie Quinlan<br/>
<br/>
Me: That&#39;s short for Acacia, her full name is Acacia.<br/>
<br/>
CA: When were you born?<br/>
<br/>
(Cacie looks blank)<br/>
<br/>
Me: When  is your birthday?<br/>
<br/>
Cacie: OH! January 10.<br/>
<br/>
CA: Who is Daron?<br/>
<br/>
(Cacie points at me)<br/>
<br/>
CA: And who is she?<br/>
<br/>
Cacie: Daron<br/>
<br/>
Me: I am your ____.<br/>
<br/>
Cacie: Oh! Mom.<br/>
<br/>
I think we&#39;re very lucky that they didn&#39;t send us right back home,<br/>
actually.... but I don&#39;t want to rsik it again.<br/>

I would not need anything.  No one asked if I was married/divorced, had<br/>
custody etc. so it didn&#39;t really matter what my documentation said (full<br/>
custody).  I did have a letter from my ex giving &quot;permission&quot; (not<br/>
notarized) but nobody wanted to see it.  My daughter has her own,<br/>
separate passport.  Perhaps that&#39;s the difference?  Or have things<br/>
changed?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Why do you have to have a letter to get his permission to travel out<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; the country?  I took my daughter to England and there was no problem<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; or<br/>
&gt; &gt; questions asked.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Really? Was this before or after 9-11, and what kind of<br/>
&gt; custodial-paternity documentation did you have? If you don&#39;t mind my<br/>
&gt; asking...? Legally they can bar your entry if you don&#39;t have a<br/>
&gt; notarized<br/>
&gt; letter, because of possible custodial issues, and from what I&#39;ve heard<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s gotten harder since 9-11. Cacie&#39;s been to Mexico with me lots of<br/>
&gt; times, but only going within the free zone (100 miles of the border)<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; we&#39;ve never been asked for anything (although last time they did thump<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; the car a lot more on the US inspection). We flew to Canada twice,<br/>
&gt; when<br/>
&gt; she was 7 months okd no one asked anything, but when she was 3  we had<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; big hassle, where they pulled us off into a little room and tried to<br/>
&gt; ask<br/>
&gt; her questions... it went like this:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Customs Agent: (looking at birth certificate) What&#39;s your name?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Cacie: Cacie Quinlan<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Me: That&#39;s short for Acacia, her full name is Acacia.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; CA: When were you born?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; (Cacie looks blank)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Me: When  is your birthday?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Cacie: OH! January 10.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; CA: Who is Daron?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; (Cacie points at me)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; CA: And who is she?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Cacie: Daron<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Me: I am your ____.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Cacie: Oh! Mom.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think we&#39;re very lucky that they didn&#39;t send us right back home,<br/>
&gt; actually.... but I don&#39;t want to rsik it again.<br/>

We go to Canada often -- since 9/11 (I was IN Canada on 9/11) -- the <br/>
questions have become less friendly for everyone.  It helps to have a <br/>
passport for the kids.  We&#39;ve had them asked if they&#39;re happy, afraid, sad, <br/>
whatever.  Not pleasant -- but not threatening, particularly.  If one isn&#39;t <br/>
trying to hide something, anyway.  ;-)<br/>

Wow! I&#39;ve never had anything like this happen to me<br/>
and Tamzin. Mind you, We&#39;ve never been to Canada.<br/>
We&#39;ve been to and from the UK loads of times, flown<br/>
within the US, and been to France and Ireland. No<br/>
one&#39;s ever asked me for any documentation from her<br/>
father (just as well because I didn&#39;t have any!). Also<br/>
she&#39;s flown to and from the UK with her dad and he&#39;s<br/>
never been asked for a letter from me, and he has a UK<br/>
passport and she has a US one. I don&#39;t even travel<br/>
with her birth certificate, just her passport. Maybe<br/>
Canada&#39;s just very strict because it&#39;s easy to get to<br/>
so that&#39;s where abductors would go? Once you&#39;re out of<br/>
the US, I doubt you&#39;d need anything but her passport<br/>
and I can&#39;t imagine that you&#39;d get any hassle.<br/>
