&#39;E&quot; word.  I try not to have them and to live in the<br/>
now, not prejudging and not living for some future<br/>
fantasy.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and my older son was running at 8 months (he<br/>
skipped walking).  My younger son was walking, very<br/>
cautiously, at 15 months.  They are very different<br/>
people.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-214970219">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;And because she&#39;s kid of an Anglophile, <br/>
she&#39;s <br/>
hyper-aware of the Britishisms they abandoned to make<br/>
the characters <br/>
American.<br/>
<br/>
She can be an irritating kid. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sandra&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;d get along great! <br/>
I kept picking apart the Americanized Harry Potter<br/>
books.  <br/>
We just finished reading Mr. Potter&#39;s Pet by Dick<br/>
King-Smith and for some bizarre reason they changed<br/>
mum to mom in the book, but everything else in the<br/>
book remained British (like the money being in pounds<br/>
for example).<br/>
Okay, I&#39;ll stop being irritating now &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
