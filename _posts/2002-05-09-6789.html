 </span></blockquote>Well yes. There are  different &quot;varieties&quot; of<br/>
Methodist, too. For example, Mt. Zion Methodist is WAY<br/>
different. It is non-liturgical. When I visited there,<br/>
I was the only &quot;White&quot;. When the pastor said &quot;Make a<br/>
joyful noise&quot;, they did (dancing, clapping).  The<br/>
Pastor was selected by his personal calling. The<br/>
pastor has to have separate income, in order to eat.<br/>
Each of that type is unique to itself and<br/>
congregation. St. Paul&#39;s has a beaurocratic hierarchy<br/>
whose pastors were (are?) selected by means of<br/>
applications and interviews and refererrals after (or<br/>
anticipation of) graduation from either seminary or<br/>
college with relevant majors and additional training<br/>
in their field. Preaching is a career with good<br/>
housing, reasonable compensation and status.<br/>
<br/>
I had a Black volunteer (Family Outreach<br/>
program....child abuse prevention) who was a priest<br/>
with the Episcopalian Church (on the FAMU campus). <br/>
One day he commented that after 20 years of active<br/>
civil rights efforts (this was about 1988 or so) that<br/>
discrimination was still entrenched in his chosen<br/>
church.  He showed me that there were some Black<br/>
priests, particularly in Africa, a few whatever comes<br/>
next, and so on until there were NO Blacks at all<br/>
above a well established ceiling. I&#39;m afraid I wasn&#39;t<br/>
too sympathetic.  My comment was &quot;What did you expect,<br/>
The Church of England, White Man&#39;s burden and all<br/>
that?&quot; Now I am stepping on MORE toes!! The<br/>
Episcopalian (that I&#39;ve met recently,in this area) are<br/>
some of the more open-minded folks!! And friendly.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some have grands, too :-) <br/>
<br/>
Some things are better, too.  It just seems wrong to<br/>
me that ANY religion, or spiritual teaching, should<br/>
have EVER had as part of its teachings that some<br/>
people&#39;s genetic qualities are to be treated badly and<br/>
others rewarded. I also sometimes feel guilty for not<br/>
fighting the fight, anymore. There are lots of social<br/>
inequities and wrongs, in lots of areas. I think I<br/>
don&#39;t have the stamina I used to.<br/>
:-(  I miss that endless energy. I am grateful that I<br/>
had access to it (energy...opportunities....) I just<br/>
hope it is only that, and not a failure of courage.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Just be aware of the histories of the churches that<br/>
one joins or patronizes.  There are bloody histories<br/>
behind most organized religions, excepting a few<br/>
wondrous ones.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks Pam. That is cool that your sister and Mom are<br/>
so close to you, in a spiritual sense, too.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t understand Baha&#39;i Faith. There is ANOTHER<br/>
example of the Big Gaps in MY learning. Could you<br/>
explain it a little, perhaps off list, if it is too<br/>
off-topic or personal. I&#39;ve done some reading, but<br/>
reading doesn&#39;t always &quot;do it&quot;, in a spiritual sense.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Sharon of the Swamp<br/>

<br/>
Well the there goes the Old Testament, right out the window.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And all those cool dirty stories with it!<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s another real-life Emperor&#39;s New Clothes situation:  How many Baptists <br/>
who say &quot;I never expose my children to sex and violence&quot; have given them <br/>
Bibles, when they were baptized, or at some other important moment, and in <br/>
that Bible is a schedule by which the whole Bible can be read in one year.  <br/>
And the parents will claim to have done that (Yes, I&#39;ve read the Bible cover <br/>
to cover) and they will encourage the kids to read their Bibles.   Yet when <br/>
faced with a story of someone having sex with his daughter or whatever, they <br/>
will get all red-faced and say &quot;That&#39;s a blasphemous lie!&quot; and when shown the <br/>
verse, they&#39;ll backpedal with &quot;Well of course, God is trying to show us a <br/>
lesson there we&#39;re not quite ready to understand,&quot; or &quot;It&#39;s not to be taken <br/>
literally.&quot;  (EEEEEP and a gigantic EEEK on that one--but the &quot;Bible <br/>
Literalists&quot; are the first to say &quot;metaphor&quot; when it&#39;s something they don&#39;t <br/>
get or are shocked to find, OR to say &quot;That was the OLD covenant with the <br/>
Jews, we only care about the NEW covenant with Jesus.&quot;  Half an hour later <br/>
they&#39;re going to be saying homosexuality is sin and to fail to physically <br/>
discipline children is a sin, and they get those &quot;literal truths&quot; from the <br/>
Old Testament.<br/>
<br/>
Remember those disclosing tablets in health classes sometimes, where you chew <br/>
them and all the plaque on your teeth shows up red?<br/>
<br/>
It would be *SO* cool to apply that dye to all the Southern Baptists in the <br/>
world and have those who have lied about reading the Bible show up red in <br/>
proportion to the parts they have not even skimmed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OH NO.... I got on religion again.<br/>
Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
