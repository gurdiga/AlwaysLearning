Is there a page or discussion list people can subscribe to for future notifications?  I would rather not have this discussion filled up with conference notifications.   <br/>
<br/>
To others who might be interested in this conference in Atlanta, please find a way to get information directly.   <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!  <br/>

P.S.  Conferences involving moderators and very-regular writers here are different and might be mentioned more often, but still not much.<br/>
