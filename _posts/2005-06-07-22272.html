Still thinking about that what-is-art question.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-293582562">I asked my 13yo what he thought art was since he still owns the very same box of crayons we bought him when he was 4.... and they still ahven&#39;t been worn much.... He said every time he &quot;swishes&quot; a three pointer&quot; in basketball he&#39;s poetry in motion&quot;..LOL<br/>
 <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1796631993">We visited a display at the Tacoma Art Museum in which the artists (The Art Guys) had combined great numbers of ordinary things.  One was a sculpture made of suitcases.  Another was made of slices of American cheese.<br/>
<br/>
My favorite thing of all was a sign: &quot;Quantity has a quality all its own&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I think of that whenever I hear people talk about &quot;quality time&quot; with their children.<br/>
