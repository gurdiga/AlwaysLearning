<div id="ygrps-yiv-1260050359">This morning I used an example about a friend not knowing that the  <br/>
women&#39;s movement did her any good.<br/>
Separately, I found out this morning that a friend of mine died  <br/>
yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
I keep obituary pages for SCA folk who have passed away, so this  <br/>
friend of mine is at the top of the list here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/people/obituaries/sca">http://sandradodd.com/people/obituaries/sca</a><br/>
<br/>
And in making a page to keep photos and notes on, I looked around this  <br/>
afternoon for what had been posted.  There was a recent photo, and an  <br/>
older one.<br/>

The second photo on this page has Karen, the one who needed to write  <br/>
an essay in the late 1980&#39;s.  She&#39;s the third woman standing--the  <br/>
tallest one, in white with a white veil.<br/>
<br/>
The dark-haired man with the chain mail is my friend Jeff.  I mention  <br/>
him sometimes.  Karen was his girlfriend in those days.<br/>
<br/>
The man kneeling in steel and leather armor is Leif (Bill Hammond),  <br/>
who died yesterday in an accident at a power plant where he worked in  <br/>
Nevada.<br/>
<br/>
He was being knighted.  The night before, I had been at Leif&#39;s vigil.   <br/>
I had known him for years, and the vigil was in a tent I had made.  In  <br/>
that discussion with him that evening, and in a story I&#39;ve told many  <br/>
times in the SCA and to unschoolers, I came up with the &quot;make the  <br/>
better choice&quot; idea that&#39;s helped me and others in those 23 years.    <br/>
Leif was saying that he was worried about being a knight, but not  <br/>
having a really medieval-looking camp.  The two of us were sitting by  <br/>
candlelight, in that tent I had made, which was well furnished.  I  <br/>
told him that our gear (mine and Keith&#39;s, and Steve&#39;s, and Marks--some  <br/>
other friends he had specified as having nice camps) were always  <br/>
evolving--that as we found better furniture or dishes or lanterns, we  <br/>
replaced the less impressive bits.  I said if he was going to buy a  <br/>
tent and his only choices were canvas or nylon, to choose canvas.  If  <br/>
he had decided on canvas and his choices were orange or brown, choose  <br/>
brown.  And incrementally his camp would get better,  if he always  <br/>
made the more medieval choice.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby was eight months old at the time of that event.  I was going to  <br/>
La Leche League, and Adult Children of Alcoholics meetings, and  <br/>
learning to be a mom.<br/>
<br/>
After years of using the &quot;better choice&quot; tool in the SCA and at home,  <br/>
I mentioned that idea in a talk I gave in Sacramento in August 2002, I  <br/>
told that story and recommended that if a mom&#39;s two choices were to  <br/>
hit or to yell, choose &quot;yell.&quot;  And the next time, yell or speak more  <br/>
quietly.  And the *next* time...  Think of two choices, and make the  <br/>
better choice.<br/>
<br/>
In the photo,  the man being touched on the head with a spear (I don&#39;t  <br/>
remember why they didn&#39;t use the sword) was Leif.  That was within  <br/>
twelve hours of the &quot;make the better choice&quot; night.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes ideas can be documented.  But I didn&#39;t set out to document  <br/>
it.  Leif died yesterday, and a photo brought forth by another friend  <br/>
includes Karen who wrote about the Women&#39;s Movement.<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby was a toddler, we were at a medieval event in Colorado.   <br/>
Kirby tripped over a twine divider, with stakes and with twine about  <br/>
six inches off the ground, marking where they were going to put a  <br/>
larger fence for the tourney field.  I helped Kirby up and knelt down  <br/>
and showed him the string he had tripped on, and showed him where it  <br/>
was, and why it was there.  Leif was standing nearby and heard the  <br/>
whole thing.  He came and told me I was a really good mom and he was  <br/>
impressed at how I was with Kirby.  Then he got tears in his eyes and  <br/>
told me for the first time that he had gotten a girlfriend pregnant  <br/>
when they were teens (I think he was 30 or so at the time he was  <br/>
telling it), and he had never met the baby.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s part of what gave me the deep knowledge that if one of my boys  <br/>
got a girl pregnant, he would still be a father but might not  <br/>
necessarily be able to be a good father, no matter how much he might  <br/>
want to be there.  That idea was discussed recently too, on this list  <br/>
or in a chat, but I didn&#39;t mention Leif&#39;s tears and confession of  <br/>
thinking of his unknown daughter when he saw others with their children.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t expect all those things to tie in as they have with recent  <br/>
discussions, and that photo.   I think it&#39;s evidence that that living  <br/>
a rich life with the expectation that sharing ideas will help people  <br/>
in unpredictable ways will create and maintain a flow of benefit that  <br/>
goes beyond the person, and beyond the family, into the larger world.<br/>
