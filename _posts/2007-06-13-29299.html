After Pat quit school, he refused to read a book. He hates them.<br/>
Thank you school for teaching my son to hate reading books. My son<br/>
has never read a book since school and that was five years ago. He&#39;s<br/>
had not even one minute of a reading lesson since school. Yet his<br/>
reading is excellent.<br/>

Cameron left school at the end of 6th grade with the same attitude: he <br/>
would never read another boook. He hated reading. *School* taught him <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
It took *years* before he read a book (he&#39;d read magazines and music <br/>
scores and such). His first book after leaving school was Rue Kream&#39;s <br/>
Parenting a Free Child. I think he was *almost* 18 when he read that. <br/>
His second was Stargirl by Jerry Spinelli.<br/>
<br/>
Right now he&#39;s finishing up Hermann Hesse&#39;s Siddhartha. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s a *very* slow reader, and he looks up *all* unfamiliar words. But <br/>
he now always has a book (and a dictionary) nearby, just in case.<br/>
<br/>
I doubt it will ever be a passion, but he&#39;s learning that it&#39;s not this <br/>
horrible, painful activity that it was in school. He&#39;s *enjoying* it! <br/>
