&gt;Wow!  It&#39;s like 6 degrees of separation!  Actually, Kathleen is here in<br/>
&gt;VA right now with us doing Fiddler.  She just got in town last week and<br/>
&gt;started rehearsing with us on Tuesday.  It was already so much fun with<br/>
&gt;Jeanne, the VA director, but now with Kathleen here too, it&#39;s so cool!<br/>
&gt;I mispoke in my last e-mail for the sake of conciseness.  Kathleen was<br/>
&gt;actually the only one who started YPT here, but Jeanne joined her the<br/>
&gt;first season and soon became her partner.  Since there are people on<br/>
&gt;this group who actually know these people, I thought I should state it<br/>
&gt;correctly!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know Kathleen considers Jeanne her partner through and through, so it <br/>
doesn&#39;t really matter.  <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t realize she was leaving so soon.<br/>
<br/>
Tell her Karen in Memphis said hello!<br/>
