are equal under the law.  We don&#39;t have equal amount of hair, our ages <br/>

not equally good at football,  etc. etc.<br/>

replace the long standing &#39;dominator paradigm.  The science suggests <br/>
that their is no hierarchy of value. the Cosmos, and Gaia (the Earth <br/>
and all its lifeforms) is a network equal interdependence among <br/>
everything that exists.<br/>

The e/t/s syndrome takes away our freedom to be what WE want to be.  <br/>
Alternatives to education are needed to give us our freedom to learn.<br/>

<br/>
No thanks.  I like the paradigm in which people live thoughtfully  <br/>
with their families without trying to transition to made-up  <br/>
paradigms, where people have to learn terms like &quot;the e/t/s/  <br/>
syndrome&quot; to be able to read things like  &quot;The e/t/s syndrome takes  <br/>
away our freedom to be what WE want to be.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There are millions of things I might want to be that are not  <br/>
available to me.  No &quot;syndrome&quot; caused that.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to help people accept and enjoy being who they ARE,  <br/>
where they are.  Not only would I like to do that, I&#39;ve been doing it  <br/>
for a long time.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I value spelling and language, and there IS a hierarchy of value,  <br/>
within any belief system, within any life, from any one point of view.<br/>
<br/>
Your belief system seems to value learning over education.  Your  <br/>
belief system (science, paradigm) seems to value equality over  <br/>
comparative valuation.    There&#39;s a clear fallacy in saying, &quot;Because  <br/>
X is important to me and I reject Y, I can assure you that all things  <br/>
are equal.&quot;  In that same statement you&#39;re assuring the reader that  <br/>
your knowledge is higher/better/more expert than theirs, too.<br/>
<br/>
The idea that all things are valuable to someone is a fine starting  <br/>
place.  The next level is &quot;What do you value?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This Gaian religion/science you discuss... does it think ozone is  <br/>
more important than Right Guard Spray Deoderant?  Is clear water  <br/>
equal to radioactive sludge?<br/>
<br/>
It might seem I&#39;m going off topic, but part of deschooling is often  <br/>
the parents learning to re-value things they had once categorized as  <br/>
&quot;educational&quot; and &quot;non-educational&quot; or &quot;good&quot; and &quot;junk.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Definitions and categories are quite central to the idea of  <br/>
analytical skills (IQ-whatever-that-is often has to do with what  <br/>
something is or isn&#39;t, or is like or isn&#39;t like, or is equal to or  <br/>
not equal to).<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
That depends on your definition of &quot;value.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My interpretation of your use of &quot;equal&quot; in the lofty phrase &quot;the  <br/>
equality of<br/>
  all elements&quot; is that one is not more valuable than another.<br/>
<br/>
Gaia needs oxygen a LOT more than Gaia needs uranium.<br/>
People like gold and iron (a LOT), but Gaia&#39;s not getting a lot of  <br/>
practical everyday use out of either one of them, as they&#39;re found in  <br/>
nature.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m guessing you didn&#39;t mean literally &quot;elements&quot; when you said  <br/>
elements, but entities and concepts.<br/>
Not all concepts are created equal, either.<br/>
<br/>
But back to the first statement about equality, and that.<br/>
We&#39;re NOT all equal under God.  Pick and God and a place, and we can  <br/>
talk about that.  (I advise against picking that Old Testament God,  <br/>
for a starting clue.)<br/>
We&#39;re not all equal under the law.<br/>
(Which country?  Which &quot;law&quot;?  What age or gender or history of the  <br/>
person?)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1685475415"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;we are equal under the law. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Children are not equal under the law. Children have certain rights <br/>
(like being supported by another human being, given free education, <br/>
food, shelter)that adults don&#39;t have and adults have MANY rights <br/>
that children do not have. <br/>
<br/>
In the US, most children do not have the right to:<br/>
<br/>
Choose where they will live.<br/>
Choose what religion they will be (if any.)<br/>
Choose whether they will attend school, and if so, which school.<br/>
Choose whether they will be spanked, or choose discipline methods <br/>
utilized in their home. <br/>
<br/>
I could go on. <br/>
<br/>
And thats just in America....kids probably have it better in some <br/>
countries, and much much worse in others. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always found it more helpful when people talk about their own <br/>
kids, and how unschooling works in their home, rather than some <br/>
abstract theory. If i wouldve found the unschoolers, instead of the <br/>
TCSers(Taking Children Seriously)when my son was two, everything <br/>
would have been different for us much sooner. It would have been so <br/>
much more meaningful for me at that time (with a very spirited two <br/>
yr old and me at a loss how to parent him)to hear what parents were <br/>
*doing* with their own kids, rather than &quot;Suppose there was a <br/>
hypothetical child named Joe, and Joe wants to climb on the TV <br/>
set...&quot;<br/>

<br/>
With some exceptions. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The government still wants to tell some folks who they can marry.<br/>
<br/>
If my husband leaves me, he won&#39;t be reported as a runaway and he won&#39;t be <br/>
sent to juvie, man.<br/>
My kid couldn&#39;t legally leave us without our consent.<br/>
If my husband hit me I could have him arrested.   But it&#39;s legal for me to <br/>
hit my kid and if I was in Wyoming I could hit hard enough to bruise him <br/>
without it being abuse.<br/>
A person who is sixteen can consent to sex but a person who is fifteen <br/>
years, three hundred sixty days old can&#39;t.<br/>
My kid can&#39;t (legally) work a full time job yet.<br/>
Old people can vote until their so goofy and confused they think they&#39;re <br/>
sixteen again but people who are really sixteen can&#39;t vote.<br/>
And there&#39;s that whole compulsory attendance thing for certain people.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe we&#39;re all equal under the laws of nature, either.   Exposed <br/>
to the elements a lost hunter will die from hypothermia while the deer he <br/>
was tracking goes happily on her way.    I can&#39;t hold my breath under water <br/>
as long as a Beluga whale can.  I can&#39;t live in super hot water like that <br/>
newly discovered little shrimp.  If I climb to the roof and jump off, nature <br/>
will remind me that gravity is a harsh mistress but my raven friend will <br/>
have a different experience.   The famous Harriet, a Galapagos tortoise, <br/>
lived to be a hundred and seventy six years old.   I&#39;ll be darn lucky to <br/>
hang on until eighty.<br/>
<br/>
I am hopeful, in my dreamy moments, that humans will eventually learn to <br/>
live on the earth with respect for all their fellow earthlings but I still <br/>
don&#39;t think that will make us all equal.<br/>

I was thinking about how children don&#39;t have equality when I was reading the<br/>
first post and then I saw yours and I thought great minds think alike.  I<br/>
can often be heard asking my friends (with school kids) &quot;is that was &quot;joey&quot;<br/>
(whatever name you want) wants to do?&quot;  A lot of times the parents look at<br/>
me with confusion when I ask that and usually ignore my question.  I&#39;ve even<br/>
had someone say &quot;it&#39;s not important what they want it&#39;s only important they<br/>
do what I want them to do). Needless to say that&#39;s not someone I hang out<br/>
with anymore!!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Children have so few rights it&#39;s disgusting.  I think about pedophiles and<br/>
what kind of prison term they get for loosing their lives (which is what<br/>
rape is) and in some states they get 2-3 years in prison.  Yet the child has<br/>
to live with having been molested or raped and the consequences of such for<br/>
their lifetime.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Children are treated as second class citizens.  My parents (who still don&#39;t<br/>
approve of homeschooling and especially child centered learning) believe<br/>
that children should do as they were told.  As I like to remind my mother<br/>
&quot;well that worked well for me didn&#39;t it&quot; (sarcasm being the highest form of<br/>
wit for us British subjects)!!!<br/>

<br/>
They ARE second class citizens (if they&#39;re &quot;citizens&quot; at all; depends  <br/>
on the definition--they&#39;re residents maybe, or natives, and for  <br/>
passport purposes they might be citizens).  But they can&#39;t vote or  <br/>
sign contracts or drive (not saying they should, just sayin&#39;...).<br/>
<br/>
There are other classes of people without full rights, though, and  <br/>
for a range of reasons, some very good.<br/>
Felons, convicted sex offenders, parolees, aliens (not space aliens,  <br/>
resident aliens)... women...<br/>
