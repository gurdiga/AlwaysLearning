<div id="ygrps-yiv-363363166"><p>The only thing I miss from our days of relaxed homeschooling since we&#39;ve started unschooling is our family read-aloud time. My kids used to sigh when I would tell them it was time, but they usually got very into it. Many times while reading the Little House series, I would find my kids outside afterwards pretending to churn butter or they would be using extra planks of wood to build their own little cabins. Since we started unschooling, I&#39;ve stopped making the kids listen to me read but have instead been offering a bedtime story. They can choose whether or not they want to listen. Lately we&#39;ve been reading a Minecraft novel, and the kids seem to enjoy it, but I&#39;ve been noticing that they don&#39;t seem to miss it when I don&#39;t read it for one reason or another. I&#39;m beginning to wonder if they are only listening out of a sense of obligation from our former days of when they were required to listen and whether or not I should take a break from our bedtime stories until they express an interest in hearing one. Does anyone have any thoughts on this?</p><p><br></p><p>Btw, when I say &quot;bedtime story,&quot; I simply mean that we wait until the 2-yr.-old is asleep because it is very hard to read while she&#39;s awake. The kids are usually awake for hours afterwards. (Unless they fall asleep during the story which sometimes happens, too.)</p></div>

 </span></blockquote>So the benefit of the reading was what made you feel better. You liked the after effect so their initial feelings didn&#39;t matter. What mattered is that you could see activity that made you feel something positive was happening.<br/>
<br/>
Is pretending to churn butter better than pretending to be Harry Potter wizards or Minecrafters? Or is it better only because you perceive it to be? Are you valuing old-time values more than you&#39;re valuing pretend play?<br/>
<br/>
Have you tried asking them what they liked and didn&#39;t like about the reading you were doing before? And what they miss? And what they like and don&#39;t like about the present reading?<br/>
<br/>
The better you get to know them, the easier it is to make choices they&#39;ll enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you could read literature at breakfast time. Or lunch. Or as a wake up while they&#39;re still in bed. Or listen to it on audio while the kids do other things or in the car.<br/>

<br/>
Ask them!  And why should it be all (every night) or nothing (give it up)?  <br/>
<br/>
Pretending to churn butter is about as useful as pretending to polish chain mail with sand in barrel.  Only people used to eat butter that was made in a wooden churn that could never really be cleaned.   Unless one owns a cow and lives in the 19th century, churning butter isn&#39;t a useful skill.<br/>
<br/>
If you read more about the author of the Little House on the Prairie books, perhaps the worshipfulness of that fictional world will fade in you enough that you can see other things that are just as valuable for stories of relationships and adventure.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1414684793"><p dir="ltr">Unschooling makes the world bigger. Now that they don&#39;t have to make the best of a bad situation, your kids will pursue the creative play that really interests them. Realizing that they *can* choose not to do the things they used to be obligated to do might look lumpy as they discover broader horizons. Your deschooling process can be enriched by realizing that you are facilitating this increased sphere, and by seeing how you were liminiting yourself through your beliefs about worthwhile pursuits.</p>

You don&#39;t need to figure it out.<br/>
Read to them if they want you to, and don&#39;t if they don&#39;t.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1200477384">I love to read before bed!&nbsp;<span style="word-spacing:normal;line-height:1.25;">Usually there are a few books already tucked into the side of our bed next to a flashlight - some that the kids like and some I am in the process of reading myself.&nbsp;</span><div><span style="word-spacing:normal;line-height:1.25;"><br></span></div><div><span style="word-spacing:normal;line-height:1.25;">Typically, when we get in bed, I&#39;ll ask the kids if they want me to read.</span><span style="line-height:1.25;word-spacing:normal;">&nbsp;If they aren&#39;t interested or if someone else reads to them, I might read a bit of my own book.

They usually know what makes him laugh! Even so, he&#39;ll often tell them what to have happen next. This can get to be a kind of&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height:1.25;word-spacing:normal;">loud entertainment though.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1828922826">The other day I received Sandra&#39;s Big Book of Unschooling that I had ordered. While I&#39;ve already read through most of her website, something about having an actual book in my hands made it seem more special. Maybe it&#39;s the feel of the paper, or the smell of a new book (although I particularly love the smell of old books even more), or the fact that I can make notations or turn down pages which are particularly meaningful to me. It just seems to make it more MINE.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Anyway, yesterday when I was reading through it, I had an epiphany about this whole reading thing because of something that she said. I think that since I&#39;m so bookish and do sincerely love them, I&#39;ve been giving them more importance than what my kids may have assigned to them. It was this particular quote that hit me :&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>~= I am so certain that learning comes from experiences and touching, hearing, seeing, smelling and tasting that in light of natural learning, books seem flat and dry.=~ (p. 148)</div><div><br></div><div>Just that one sentence turned everything upside down for me. While I have been putting so much importance in the written word, my children have been exploring and building, laughing and playing, and experiencing LIFE. How could any book outdo that?</div><div><br></div><div>So, thank you, Sandra- so much. I&#39;m framing that quote and putting it on my wall as a reminder to myself to live life as my children do.</div><div><br></div></div>
