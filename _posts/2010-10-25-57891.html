Soldiers (2003), which we are enjoying, and he&#39;s asking me a million<br/>
questions.  Gotta run!  In the first 15 minutes he&#39;s totally engaged.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1977949476">There are quite a few good WWII movies out there. One of our favorites was &quot;Boy in the Striped Pajamas.&quot; PG-13<br/>
Set during World War II, a story seen through the innocent eyes of Bruno, the eight-year-old son of the commandant at a concentration camp, whose forbidden friendship with a Jewish boy on the other side of the camp fence has startling and unexpected consequences. <br/>
<br/>
My 8 year old enjoyed &quot;The Pianist&quot; from 2002 as well. It is rated R though. Famed Polish concert pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody, in an Oscar-winning role) struggles to survive the onslaught of Nazi tyranny during World War II in this Roman Polanski-directed drama based on Szpilman&#39;s memoirs. In spite of his well-known musical talents, Szpilman spends several years holed up in Warsaw, barely alive and subsisting on scraps, until grace comes in the form of a second chance -- at music, at freedom and at life.<br/>
<br/>
It may or may not be too much violence for a 10 year old. My 8 year old liked it though, but he likes horror movies. My younger son does not like horror much, except he did like Zombieland. You just have to listen to your kids. Each kid is different.<br/>
<br/>
I know you are asking for WWII, but if he likes learning about the Great Depression era, my boys liked &quot;Kit Kittredge: An American Girl&quot; with Abigail Breslin. I liked it a lot as well.<br/>
<br/>
We have the &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; series. I haven&#39;t seen it, but my husband watched it with Holden. Holden told me he liked it. I can&#39;t say how violent it was since I haven&#39;t seen it. My husband is not home right now for me to ask him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-122053068">I really enjoyed Grave of the Fireflies.  It&#39;s really sad, but also from the <br/>
perspective of regular Japanese citizens.  It was a perspective not found in <br/>
other WWII movies.  It&#39;s animated as well.  We all cried after seeing it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-817329109">-=- I probably would have veered away from all<br/>
this stuff so that we could *get back to* language arts or history  <br/>
(haha).<br/>
<br/>
-=-And if it all ended tomorrow and he said, &quot;I decided I don&#39;t care  <br/>
about war<br/>
stuff anymore. Let&#39;s go make s&#39;mores,&quot; we&#39;d do it, and I wouldn&#39;t look<br/>
back.-=-<br/>
<br/>
That is beautiful and makes me want to work on web pages, but I&#39;m  <br/>
awake unnaturally (I forgot to turn on the fan or AC, and the puppy  <br/>
was whining to go out) and I need to go back to bed.  I&#39;m hoping this  <br/>
notes will remind me to get back to it soon.<br/>
<br/>
Classic s&#39;mores, though, which have four squares of a Hershey bar, can  <br/>
be connected to American GI&#39;s in WWII, because plain Hershey bars and  <br/>
pairs of nylon stockings were said to have been common trade goods in  <br/>
post-war Europe.   That&#39;s not necessarily something to discuss in any  <br/>
detail to younger children, but there were marriages and other effects  <br/>
that came of relationships between soldiers and locals during the  <br/>
occupation.<br/>
<br/>
Marty was talking about having heard in his class on reading and  <br/>
critical thought that there were incidents in VietNam of draftees  <br/>
killing their officers and running away, *in* VietNam.  And we&#39;ve seen  <br/>
years later the sad fate of some of the mixed-race children of that  <br/>
war, and of other conflict zones.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not recommending those topics for discussion with kids unless (as  <br/>
with my friend Helene) the very reason that they have a (for example)  <br/>
half-French father and relatives in France (or Germany, or elsewhere)  <br/>
is related to those issues.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1106554721">All these great connections!  Thanks for all the ideas!<br/>
<br/>
Just had to share:<br/>
We are watching Saints and Soldiers at the moment because it was available<br/>
immediately on Netflix.  Not the best movie I&#39;ve ever seen, but he&#39;s having<br/>
a blast trying to identify all the guns (he&#39;s gotten into this gun<br/>
fascination).    I am really impressed with his gun knowledge.  The story is<br/>
based on an actual massacre near the Belgian border during WWII, and he&#39;s<br/>
been asking all kinds of questions about the Germans and the draft (because<br/>
we watch MASH all the time), and so we&#39;ve talked about how WWII was a more<br/>
*popular* war to join and we had to look up whether there was a draft during<br/>
WWII (there was), whereas Korea was not a very popular war -- we chatted<br/>
about some possible reasons for that.  And then he started asking me about<br/>
Vietnam -- which I know very little about.  We&#39;ve got lots of things to look<br/>
up -- my head is swirling trying to keep track of it all.  He has connected<br/>
this movie to the book Number the Stars, which we read together last year,<br/>
and I think next we&#39;re going to watch Boy in the Striped Pajamas.  His dad<br/>
was watching a documentary the other day on the bombing of Hiroshima -- and<br/>
so we got into a conversation about the connections between Japan and China<br/>
and Germany, and why the Korean conflict happened so soon after WWII... It<br/>
just goes on and on.<br/>
<br/>
Today, while the movie was playing, he asked me where we could *rent a game<br/>
board.*<br/>
<br/>
I said, &quot;Rent a game board?&quot;  Think.  Think.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You mean a board game?&quot; I said.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yeah!&quot; he said.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What board game?&quot;  I said.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t care...just one about war and stuff!&quot;  he said.  So I found the<br/>
Axis and Allies board games online, and I&#39;m thinking of getting one of them.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, he has been playing lots of video games, including one called<br/>
World at War that is based on WWII, and he&#39;s in love with it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just following him around in all this enthusiasm.  It&#39;s been fun, and a<br/>
huge change from last year this time when I was still trying to force<br/>
subjects on him.  Last year, before finding Sandra Dodd, I would have<br/>
probably pooh-poohed his gun fascination (too violent), rolled my eyes at<br/>
his video game obsession (a waste of time), laughed at his suggestion that<br/>
we *rent* a board game, and never given any thought to what war movies he<br/>
may or may not care about, and I probably would have veered away from all<br/>
this stuff so that we could *get back to* language arts or history (haha).<br/>
<br/>
And if it all ended tomorrow and he said, &quot;I decided I don&#39;t care about war<br/>
stuff anymore.  Let&#39;s go make s&#39;mores,&quot; we&#39;d do it, and I wouldn&#39;t look<br/>
back.<br/>

<br/>
Oh, that reminded me! When I was a child, there was a series on PBS called World at War, about WWII. I wasn&#39;t interested in all about war, but the series was so well presented and narrated, that I watched the whole thing, and looked forward to it coming on.<br/>
<br/>
Just looked, and Amazon has the DVD series. <br/>

<br/>
I didn&#39;t realize it was narrated by Sir Laurence Olivier!  I would have been 8 and 9 when this was on. I might need to get a set for myself!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-25064210">I was looking for Canadian WWII movies (since I&#39;m Canadian), so I went  <br/>
to the National Film Board site and found these:<br/>

<br/>
Some short films, some longer about many aspects of war, in  <br/>
documentary form.<br/>
<br/>
I also found these jointly-made Canadian films (the first one is  <br/>
anime!):<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1244342616">All cool!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to mention how wonderful the Hitler Channel...I mean the HISTORY Channel...is for all things WWII. It&#39;s a favorite time period for me, and I can&#39;t get enough. I have no interest in the war in the Pacific---only Europe. It can be seasonal, but there&#39;s usually *something* about WWII during every non-seasonal week, and sometimes it&#39;s 100% WWII. Very cool.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t feeling too good last winter, and we had The Boy in the Striped Pajamas in from Netflix. Ben and Cameron watched it and HIGHLY suggested that I not watch it. In my state, they felt I couldn&#39;t handle it. I still haven&#39;t watched it, but you *might* want to watch it first, just in case.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are also more holocausty films, Schindler&#39;s List and Sophie&#39;s Choice, which could also be too much for a child or sensitive adult. The recent Tarantino bloodfest, Inglourious Bastards, too might be too much, although I enjoyed it. Swing Dance is an unusual answer to Hitler Youth. On a *much* lighter note, there&#39;s The Producers, new and old.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anne Frank&#39;s diary and Eli Wiesel&#39;s books. Also Number the Stars by Lois Lowery.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Visiting Auschwitz is disturbing and fascinating, if you can work a trip to Germany in. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Closer to home, and cheaper: Usborne Books has a great WWII book, full of weapons and gear. Usborne Books has great books about everything!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There aren&#39;t many still alive, but if you poke around your city, you could possibly find a WWII veteran who would talk to you about his/her experiences. (I say *her* because Ben&#39;s deceased grandmother was a nurse and ran from Rommel and his tanks through the deserts of Africa! The STORIES! &lt;g&gt;) I think several of the Dolittle Raiders (Pacific) are still alive. They were just a couple of years ago, anyway. One lives here in Columbia, SC.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And there&#39;s always the stand-by board game, Risk (which I always lost because I wanted to own/rule Europe! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

All these great connections!  Thanks for all the ideas!<br/>
<br/>
Just had to share:<br/>
We are watching Saints and Soldiers at the moment because it was available<br/>
immediately on Netflix.  Not the best movie I&#39;ve ever seen, but he&#39;s having<br/>
a blast trying to identify all the guns (he&#39;s gotten into this gun<br/>
fascination).    I am really impressed with his gun knowledge.  The story is<br/>
based on an actual massacre near the Belgian border during WWII, and he&#39;s<br/>
been asking all kinds of questions about the Germans and the draft (because<br/>
we watch MASH all the time), and so we&#39;ve talked about how WWII was a more<br/>
*popular* war to join and we had to look up whether there was a draft during<br/>
WWII (there was), whereas Korea was not a very popular war -- we chatted<br/>
about some possible reasons for that.  And then he started asking me about<br/>
Vietnam -- which I know very little about.  We&#39;ve got lots of things to look<br/>
up -- my head is swirling trying to keep track of it all.  He has connected<br/>
this movie to the book Number the Stars, which we read together last year,<br/>
and I think next we&#39;re going to watch Boy in the Striped Pajamas.  His dad<br/>
was watching a documentary the other day on the bombing of Hiroshima -- and<br/>
so we got into a conversation about the connections between Japan and China<br/>
and Germany, and why the Korean conflict happened so soon after WWII... It<br/>
just goes on and on.<br/>
<br/>
Today, while the movie was playing, he asked me where we could *rent a game<br/>
board.*<br/>
<br/>
I said, &quot;Rent a game board?&quot;  Think.  Think.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You mean a board game?&quot; I said.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yeah!&quot; he said.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What board game?&quot;  I said.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t care...just one about war and stuff!&quot;  he said.  So I found the<br/>
Axis and Allies board games online, and I&#39;m thinking of getting one of them.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, he has been playing lots of video games, including one called<br/>
World at War that is based on WWII, and he&#39;s in love with it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just following him around in all this enthusiasm.  It&#39;s been fun, and a<br/>
huge change from last year this time when I was still trying to force<br/>
subjects on him.  Last year, before finding Sandra Dodd, I would have<br/>
probably pooh-poohed his gun fascination (too violent), rolled my eyes at<br/>
his video game obsession (a waste of time), laughed at his suggestion that<br/>
we *rent* a board game, and never given any thought to what war movies he<br/>
may or may not care about, and I probably would have veered away from all<br/>
this stuff so that we could *get back to* language arts or history (haha).<br/>
<br/>
And if it all ended tomorrow and he said, &quot;I decided I don&#39;t care about war<br/>
stuff anymore.  Let&#39;s go make s&#39;mores,&quot; we&#39;d do it, and I wouldn&#39;t look<br/>
back.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-752474893">The timing of this thread is great for us. Jesse, 10, got really interested in WWII as a result of watching &quot;Inglorious Bastards&quot; last winter and just this week has been asking about WWII and Vietnam, got books about them from the library and wants to make a movie about one of them after he decides which interests him the most. These strewing ideas are so helpful. I had been wary of &quot;Inglorious Bastards&quot; and watched it with him sure he&#39;d want to turn it off (they&#39;ve run from the room over anything too realistically violent in movies). It is his favorite movie and he can talk about why for an hour. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-234591992">I&#39;ve not had a habit of remembering titles of war movies - I&#39;ll try to<br/>
remember to ask my son who is very interested in World War II.  Though I<br/>
know one of his first references won&#39;t be a movie it would be the series<br/>
Band of Brothers.<br/>
<br/>
For a story of the experiences of Allied women and children prisoners of War<br/>
in Singapore I&#39;d look to the BBC series Tenko.  I recall being captivated<br/>
(horrified, stunned, aghast) by it in the 80s, and thus found the later<br/>
movie Paradise Road almost superficial (in part understandable: as a movie<br/>
it couldn&#39;t stretch the length of the women&#39;s experiences, it also focussed<br/>
on the brief period in which some women formed a choir) - the flavour the<br/>
movie left seemed less dire, less shocking, less awe than the series.  The<br/>
series allowed one to develop a deeper and longer-lasting appreciation for<br/>
the experiences of these women by spending time with the hardships,<br/>
indignities, ill treatment, starvation, desperate measures, ethical<br/>
dilemmas, hopelessness, griefs - to end not with glossy conclusions about<br/>
endurance or attitude or how singing helps or resilience but rather to end<br/>
still pondering.  I felt the series allowed more opportunity to appreciate<br/>
the variability of behaviour amongst the prison-keepers, the dramatic impact<br/>
one psychotic with authority can have -v- the challenges soldiers have in<br/>
behaving humanely when their leaders are not.<br/>
<br/>
Then there is The Dunera Boys (an Australian movie about a camp in Australia<br/>
to which the British sent ex-German immigrants (mostly Jews) they had<br/>
rounded up as potential spies).<br/>
