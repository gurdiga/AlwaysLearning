<div id="ygrps-yiv-1253394374">Very brave of you Sandra!<br/>
<br/>
When I was in Brazil, 2 months ago, dd run over a gardening tool and had to<br/>
have 3 stiches. (If I were brave and have asked the doctor to do 5 stiches<br/>
instead, would have saved me worries as after I took the stiches off 7 days<br/>
later, we saw blood coming out the next morning.  It was on Saturday and the<br/>
emergency room of that small city hospital were full.  I thought that our<br/>
case were not that &quot;emergency&quot;.)<br/>
<br/>
Any way the doctor only prescribe soap.  Only soap?  No antibiotics cream,<br/>
no disinfectant? No, the doctor said; &quot;just wash the area with soap every<br/>
day&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A friend, and neighbor that is a nurse told me the wonder of the aloe to<br/>
&quot;seal&quot; the wound/cut.  I tried it.  I would cut the aloe and spread that<br/>
sticky fluid over the cut.  IT REALLY WORKED.<br/>
<br/>
On the 8th day after the emergency room visit, mother, sister, dd and I were<br/>
at the beach. The week long vacation were just beginning.  7 days fm that,<br/>
anybody did not have to guess hard to see that we had been on a vacation.<br/>
<br/>
love and peace</div>
