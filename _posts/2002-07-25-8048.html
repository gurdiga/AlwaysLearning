<div id="ygrps-yiv-1107489462">Happy Birthday, Joylyn!<br/>
<br/>
Today/25th is also Ramona King&#39;s birthday, another homeschooling mom here <br/>
(recently of Houston, but living here now).<br/>
<br/>
Kirby turns 16 on Monday the 29th.  He&#39;s not planning anything special.  <br/>
There&#39;s a staff meeting with food that night where he works.  They offered to <br/>
let him off for his birthday, but he said no, he&#39;d go to the meeting, so <br/>
they&#39;re adding a cake.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Kirby turns 16 on Monday the 29th.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can remember 16 ... it was such a big deal birthday<br/>
for me, because of getting my driver&#39;s license. My<br/>
first step to freedom! On my 17th birthday, I moved<br/>
out on my own. That one was even better!!<br/>
<br/>
I turned 37 last week. My best present was from a<br/>
new-ish friend of mine who was surprised I was 37 and<br/>
told me I look so young. I&#39;ll cherish that while it<br/>
lasts!<br/>
<br/>
And I got the gift I wanted from my husband ... a ping<br/>
pong table. Not for ping pong ... they make great<br/>
cutting tables for sewing projects. He got some of<br/>
those adhesive tape measures to put on the edges. I&#39;m<br/>
making mattresses for the bunks in our RV right now<br/>
and that big old table will come in handy.<br/>
<br/>
Happy birthday all you Cancers-on-the-cusp and Leos!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1352527701">Sorry Joylyn, just got back to town so this is late, Happy Birthday!<br/>
<br/>
Just saw a fabulous post on breastfeeding by you on home-ed, you go!<br/>
<br/>
And to all the other August birthdays, Happy Birthday!<br/>
<br/>
Hundreds of messages behind and my house is a total wreck.<br/>
<br/>
Just went to visit some relatives -- very clean house - very creepy - very<br/>
cold atmosphere. <br/>
