<div id="ygrps-yiv-2025883205">Last week a new boy joined my 9yo son&#39;s gymnastics team.  We&#39;ve seen<br/>
this boy at many competitions and he&#39;s very good!  He was immediately<br/>
accepted by most of the boys on the team, and there seemed to be little<br/>
insecurity about his advanced abilities, but then yesterday my son told<br/>
me that one of the lower scoring boys on the team had whispered<br/>
something to him about the new boy.  It was one sentence, containing 3<br/>
not nice words, and was a very ugly thing to say.  The boy who said it<br/>
is a really nice kid, and I attribute it to a degree of resentment<br/>
toward this new and very talented boy.  But it made me think about<br/>
something.  My kids routinely tell me EVERYTHING that is said by their<br/>
friends and others.  It doesn&#39;t matter how bad it is, they tell me.<br/>
Sometimes they&#39;re laughing and think it&#39;s funny, sometimes they sound<br/>
disapproving.  At home, little is off limits in our house.  Curse words<br/>
are tolerated, we have few TV limits, any topic is open for discussion,<br/>
and we hide nothing from our kids.  We do expect very nice public<br/>
behavior, however, and we get it.  I&#39;m wondering if our laid back<br/>
attitude at home is responsible for our kids willingness to pass on so<br/>
much to us.  They never have to worry that we&#39;ll tell another parent<br/>
that their child behaved badly, or that we&#39;ll look down on a friend for<br/>
saying something socially unacceptable, or that we&#39;ll cut down on social<br/>
time due to another child&#39;s &quot;bad influence&quot;.  Anybody else have any<br/>
thoughts or experience on this topic?  If this is part of the reason we<br/>
hear so much, then conversely, parents who have strict rules at home<br/>
must hear very little about the things their kids are exposed to.  I<br/>
know my mother was extremely strict, and I would have been scared to<br/>
death to tell her the things my kids tell me.<br/>

<br/>
Our kids confide in us too, and their friends are over here a lot.<br/>
<br/>
If I have a problem with their friends&#39; behavior I rarely talk to the mom <br/>
(unless it&#39;s  a pretty young kid), but just directly with the kid.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s my experience with strict parents too.  They set so many rules that <br/>
the kids don&#39;t feel like talking to them after a while, or they &quot;talk&quot; to <br/>
them but they&#39;re just saying &quot;yes sir,&quot; and &quot;yes ma&#39;am&quot; and nothing of real <br/>
depth or import.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My dd 11 told me she felt sorry for her friends because they will <br/>
talk to her about things that are bothering them, and she will <br/>
suggest that they talk to their mom, and they act like she is crazy <br/>
or say things like &quot;she wouldn&#39;t understand&quot;.  She said she couldn&#39;t <br/>
imagine not having me to tell everything too.<br/>
When I&#39;ve talked to my friends, I have been really suprised when they <br/>
wonder what their kids know about things(like sex or other social <br/>
issues).  They don&#39;t take the time to ask or don&#39;t have their <br/>
relationship intact to get real answers from their kids<br/>
It makes me realize those commercials that tell us all to &quot;talk to <br/>
our kids&quot; aren&#39;t really such a stupid, patronizing idea.<br/>
