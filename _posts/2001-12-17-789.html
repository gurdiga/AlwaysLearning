<div id="ygrps-yiv-754658589">Here&#39;s a recipe I&#39;ve made over and over...and I&#39;m not a huge caramel fan, <br/>
but I do love these. Enjoy...<br/>
<br/>
1 C sugar<br/>
1 C butter<br/>
1 C dark Karo corn syrup<br/>
14 oz can sweetened condensed milk<br/>
1 t vanilla<br/>
<br/>
Bring sugar, butter, and corn syrup to a boil in saucepan, stirring. Then <br/>
boil 4 minutes without stirring. Remove pan from heat and add sweetened <br/>
condensed milk. Mix well. Return pan to heat and cook at medium-low boil <br/>
30 minutes, or until mixture reaches 238 on candy thermometer, stirring <br/>
constantly. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla. Pour into a buttered <br/>
9-inch square pan. <br/>
<br/>
Cool in pan two hours. Remove from pan and cut with very sharp serrated <br/>
knife into 1-inch pieces. Wrap each piece in wax paper.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yum...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
take care,<br/>
