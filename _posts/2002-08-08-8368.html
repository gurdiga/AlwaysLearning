<div id="ygrps-yiv-985272888">I don&#39;t know how to &quot;capture&quot; stuff, but the comment about being made to feel <br/>
inferior<br/>
<br/>
 and wrong came up.  This is something that goes through my mind whenever some<br/>
<br/>
 type of formal group comes up and my children want to join, like a church <br/>
activity. <br/>
<br/>
 Some programs are so academic and competitive even if they look &quot;fun&quot; to the <br/>
<br/>
child.  The last thing I want my child to experience is feeling wrong and <br/>
inferior,<br/>
<br/>
 especially at church.  My &quot;mom protection instinct&quot; kicks in. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-530202759">Hi I am a newby on this list and i felt moved to reply to what joy <br/>
wrote. I used to feel like that too, although i didnt want to <br/>
overprotect my kids. But i did find a great organisation, Woodcraft <br/>
Folk, which is a co-operative organisation for girls and boys, and it <br/>
is like cubs without the authoritarianism etc. They do loads of <br/>
really cool stuff depending where you live of course, and have camps <br/>
which are for the whole family.Many of the people we met there were <br/>
like minded, there were a few unschooies and the kids were all really <br/>
great, non-judgemental, not into being fashion vicitms etc!<br/>
To introduce myself, which i should have done first, I am single mum <br/>
to 2 great unschooled autonomous boys, age 11 and 17. My eldest has <br/>
an autistic spectrum &quot;disorder&quot; which was only a problem during the <br/>
few years he did attend school. By the time i was thinking about <br/>
stuff like home-school conflict etc I had a 5 year old as well and i <br/>
decided to continue the free child stuff and not send him to school, <br/>
and my eldest came out of school. His &quot;problems&quot; are only problems in <br/>
a false environment where kids are judged by their ability to fit in <br/>
with school. To cut a long story short, the youngest has never had <br/>
any formal education, not been &quot;taught&quot; to read and write etc and is <br/>
a happy, confident and independent young kid, who knows how to talk <br/>
to people and knows how to learn what he needs to. He is into <br/>
building websites, repairing and upgrading PCs, and a lot <br/>
of &quot;outdoor&quot; stuff. He is very popular with his friends of all ages, <br/>
including babies! The eldest works part time in a bakery in a <br/>
supermarket, he manages okay, and is happy which are the main <br/>
concerns with autistic kids as far as i feel, not whether or not they <br/>
can seem &quot;normal&quot;. Unschooling has worked for us,I know a lot of <br/>
people who don&#39;t trust their kids enough to let them be free, even <br/>
though they do comment on my kids and how &quot;well&quot; they do, <br/>
particularly the youngest. I also know people who cannot believe that <br/>
their children would be able to educate themselves. I always say to <br/>
them, let them be for a few weeks and see just how much they do, even <br/>
if it isn&#39;t &quot;educational&quot;. In fact we don&#39;t distinguish between <br/>
educational and non-educational as all things are ducational to a <br/>
child.<br/>
We are also an attachmentparenting/continuum family and i feel that <br/>
unschooling has followed on naturally from that, although i know some <br/>
people only &quot;do&quot; attachment parenting for the first few years and <br/>
even then not all the time.<br/>
I would like to recommend a book called Magical Child by Joseph <br/>
Chiltern Pearce, which explains in more detail how children do learn <br/>
from their experiences and why it is so important that they should be <br/>
able to explore their environment, by touch, taste, smell etc, <br/>
without interference from well meaning adults, and why things like <br/>
having their needs met on cue can affect the development of their <br/>
minds. It also explains why teaching young chidren abstract concepts <br/>
is so damaging. I havent seen this book in the UK as it is not in <br/>
print here, but i happen to sell it through my attachment parenting <br/>
small business, along with all the John Holt books and other home <br/>
ed,unschooling and natural parenting books, plus baby slings and so <br/>
forth. You can email me for a list or catalogue at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:kinder-supplies@...">kinder-supplies@...</a> . But this is not an advert, I&#39;m <br/>
merely trying to spread the word. I recommended that book long before <br/>
i sold it. Another book i would recommend, although it is about a <br/>
school, is Summerhill, by ASNeill. I dont sell that one, it is widely <br/>
available and can be bought second hand as well.<br/>
I would really love to hear from other parents of adolescents who <br/>
have been self directed/autonomous from birth and who have resisted <br/>
the urge to teach them, it would be very interesting to see if they <br/>
are all as self sufficient!<br/>
Regards to you all, and i do look forward to reading and posting on <br/>
the list!<br/>

Relapsing fever cases reported in Sheep Springs<br/>
By Valerie Gritton/Staff writer<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.daily-times.com/Stories/0%2C1413%2C129%257E6572%257E782574%2C00.">http://www.daily-times.com/Stories/0%2C1413%2C129%257E6572%257E782574%2C00.</a><br/>

<br/>
SHEEP SPRINGS More than 40 cases of a tick-borne<br/>
disease have been <br/>
reported<br/>
in the Sheep Springs area 40 miles south of Shiprock.<br/>
<br/>
According to reports, individuals contracted relapsing<br/>
fever while <br/>
attending<br/>
a Navajo &quot;coming of age&quot; ceremony that was being<br/>
hosted outside.<br/>
<br/>
Individuals with the disease were taken to Indian<br/>
Health Services and <br/>
the<br/>
University of New Mexico Hospital.<br/>
<br/>
Relapsing fever, which is caused by a bacteria known<br/>
as spirochetes, is<br/>
contracted through tick bites in the Rocky Mountain<br/>
region, said Dr. <br/>
Edith<br/>
Umland with the New Mexico Department of Health.<br/>
<br/>
It can also be spread by the bite of a rodent or other<br/>
infected animal.<br/>
<br/>
Symptoms of the disease may also include nausea,<br/>
vomiting and upper<br/>
abdominal pain.<br/>
<br/>
What makes relapsing fever unique is the way the fever<br/>
spontaneously <br/>
occurs<br/>
and then goes into remission, only to reappear again<br/>
after a few days.<br/>
<br/>
It develops three to 18 days after exposure to the<br/>
bacteria and is <br/>
treated<br/>
through the use of antibiotics.<br/>
<br/>
In the United States, clusters of cases are reported<br/>
every year, <br/>
however,<br/>
Umland said in New Mexico only a few cases are known.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If there&#39;s one person exposed it&#39;s almost never a 100<br/>
percent attack <br/>
rate<br/>
in a group,&quot; Umland said. &quot;But there can be several<br/>
people exposed at <br/>
one<br/>
time and several people sick.&quot;<br/>
RELAPSING FEVER (TICK BORNE).<br/>
What is relapsing fever? ... Who gets relapsing fever?<br/>
Anyone can get<br/>
relapsing fever who is bitten by an infected tick. ...<br/>
