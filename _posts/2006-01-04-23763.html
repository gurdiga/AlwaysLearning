<div id="ygrps-yiv-818541428"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Self-regulation refers to the body&#39;s ability to sense<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;and, for the most part, address them automatically.<br/>

dysfunction. Her brain <br/>

a self-reg <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;that she no longer wants, but can&#39;t stop.<br/>
&gt;Melissa<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I see we live in the same world Melissa.  My sons<br/>
Thomas and Alex are both developmentally different,<br/>
Thomas has Aspergers Syndrome, (High Functioning<br/>
Autism) among other related differences or<br/>
dysfunctions, and Alex is somewhere on the autism<br/>
spectrum as well.  We don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to<br/>
have kids who are not like this, who are &quot;normal.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
For a long time we didn&#39;t see Alex&#39; tendancies towards<br/>
autism spectrum difficulties because he&#39;s so very<br/>
different from Thomas and he&#39;s much more functional or<br/>
less adversely affected in a number of ways than<br/>
Thomas is.  Thomas, being older, set our definitions<br/>
for autism as being the things he does, and that made<br/>
it harder for us to see it in Alex.  However the<br/>
reason autism is described as a spectrum and<br/>
symbolized with a multicolored puzzle image, is due to<br/>
it&#39;s huge range of symptoms and modes of presentation<br/>
and it&#39;s many unknown and mysterious qualities.  <br/>
<br/>
Autism is really hard to get a diagnosis for usually,<br/>
particularly high functioning autism, and the kids<br/>
usually run through scads of labels (particularly if<br/>
they are in school) to explain their behavioral issues<br/>
and other problems and challenges (labels like ADHD,<br/>
learning disabilities, mood disorders, bi-polar,<br/>
sensory integration dysfunction and so on) before they<br/>
finally hit on autism.  Often they do have those or<br/>
other things going on too (common comorbid diagnosis)<br/>
that run in that developmental area, further clouding<br/>
and confusing things.  Thomas sure does.  many times<br/>
diagnostic difficulties are just because we don&#39;t<br/>
understand autism very well at all, and have very<br/>
little idea what causes it (none at all officially<br/>
accepted) or what &quot;it&quot; exacly is and does.  Medical<br/>
people are also afraid to diagnose it because it&#39;s a<br/>
fearful word, one they are afraid of and one parents<br/>
get viscerally angry for having applied to their<br/>
child.  They would rather say PDDNOS (Pervasive<br/>
Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified) or<br/>
something similarly ineffectual, which means very<br/>
little and helps (as in making therapies and things<br/>
available, helping parents understand and parent their<br/>
child better and so on) not at all.<br/>
<br/>
The three adults in our home are also somewhere on the<br/>
spectrum or shadow border of autism, including myself.<br/>
 Obviously there are well known genetic components and<br/>
it&#39;s common for mutliple generations back in an<br/>
autistic&#39;s family to share myriad clues and tendancies<br/>
(often just viewed as eccentricities) towards autism. <br/>
It&#39;s also common to have a much greater autism<br/>
percentage in families with many members involved in<br/>
maths, arts and sciences, which describes my family<br/>
certainly.<br/>
<br/>
I feel that the difference between what constitutes a<br/>
difference and what is a dysfunction often boils down<br/>
to point of view and comparisons to the most common<br/>
denominators.  Common doesn&#39;t always equate to normal<br/>
as far as we&#39;re concerned.  Different doesn&#39;t always<br/>
mean dysfunctional.  That&#39;s something I think most<br/>
unscoolers can agree with pretty readily.  In some<br/>
things yes, there is true dysfunction that needs<br/>
addressing, but other times there&#39;s just differently<br/>
functioning, and that&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been really hard for me, as an unschooler, to<br/>
find the balance between what my beliefs and<br/>
principles tell me about parenting and about<br/>
unschooling, and what my children actually need.  Tom<br/>
and I have had to come to a hard and not desired<br/>
conclusion that our kids do *need* us to set<br/>
boundaries, and yes some rules, and to help them<br/>
schedule and manage different things, more than a<br/>
&quot;normal&quot; (unschooled or otherwise) child would.  They<br/>
really do need that kind of black and white pattern to<br/>
follow, because a world of greys is totally<br/>
overwhelming for them and causes all sorts of bad<br/>
things to happen, in them and in our family.  We know,<br/>
we learned the hard way, being stubborn about wanting<br/>
to unschool our kids, not set rules, not have bedtimes<br/>
and such.  <br/>
<br/>
They often cannot recognize, let alone articulate how<br/>
they feel or what they need.  Although they are both<br/>
showing remarkable progress in that area, but are<br/>
still behind where most kids their age would be in<br/>
those abilities.  Recognizing and acting on the<br/>
emotions and needs of others if hard too, and likely<br/>
will be all their lives.  Reading faces (angry, sad,<br/>
worried) and body language is really hard for them. <br/>
Knowing and then taking appropriate action under<br/>
stress is really hard for them, and stress is always<br/>
one moment of frustration away, like flipping a switch<br/>
from happy to raging.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve learned that our kids really do need to be woke<br/>
up at a general certain time and helped to get to bed<br/>
at a certain time, because they really, really *can&#39;t*<br/>
do that self regulation, and without a regular<br/>
schedule for sleeping there is a cascading<br/>
deterioration in them in many ways.  They need<br/>
patterns and routines and rituals for everything, and<br/>
if we don&#39;t provide them they create their own,<br/>
sometimes inappropriate ones, but other times fine. <br/>
They also deteriorate if they don&#39;t have a regular<br/>
patterned schedule overall, both daily and weekly. <br/>
They need to know what&#39;s coming, plan for things, have<br/>
a sense of control.  Surprises, even good ones, are<br/>
horibly upsetting.  For instance they pick out their<br/>
own gifts and help me wrap them because that&#39;s the<br/>
only way they are comfortable with recieving wrapped<br/>
gifts.  <br/>
<br/>
They really do need for us to help redirect (often<br/>
firmly and with physical intervention) their conflicts<br/>
and self soothing behaviors (tics, etc.) to prevent<br/>
things from getting out of hand, perseverating<br/>
obsessivness, impulsive violence, etc.  We really do<br/>
need to manage their emotional outbursts as well,<br/>
having to use physical restraint to prevent behavior<br/>
that is self injurious or injurious to others.  This<br/>
is lessening as they get older thankfully!! but Thomas<br/>
is 9 and I still have to do it a couple times a week<br/>
at least.  <br/>
<br/>
We really do need to insist on certain clothing<br/>
choices appropriate to the weather or setting, because<br/>
they have a hard time learning from experience and<br/>
have sensory problems that can cause things like<br/>
frostbite and illness before they think they might<br/>
need to get warmer or drier or whatever, or a lack of<br/>
social awareness or sensory or other problems that<br/>
will cause them to want to run barefoot in a food<br/>
store or restaurant, or walk around with their hands<br/>
in their pants, self fondling as a toddler would, or<br/>
remove their shirt, lick people or things, or<br/>
whatever.  We&#39;re a lot more relaxed about what&#39;s an<br/>
acceptable choice or behavior than a lot of folks<br/>
we&#39;ve known, but we do have to have some parameters in<br/>
there and constant reminders.  Just asking them to<br/>
consider their actions and be respectful to others, or<br/>
treat them how they would want to be treated or<br/>
similar parental admonissions is totally not enough<br/>
information at all and open to far too much<br/>
interpretation, not to mention lapses in impulse<br/>
control.<br/>
<br/>
These are not &quot;retarded&quot; or mentally deficient kids. <br/>
They are bright, have been called &quot;gifted&quot;, have a wry<br/>
and surprising (as in unusual) sense of humor, have<br/>
talents and skills.  They are extremely verbose and<br/>
articulate (Thomas is hyperverbal) with large and well<br/>
developed vocabularies.  They play complex adult<br/>
computer games and enjoy adult movies and books as<br/>
well as kids ones.  Thomas (9) wants to be a director<br/>
(of movies) when he grows up and can wax long on movie<br/>
plots, themes, character development, backstory<br/>
details, and so on, that being his obsession of<br/>
choice.  He loves complicated multi-movie or<br/>
multi-book fantasy sagas.  Thomas is also a very<br/>
gifted storyteller.  Alex (7) loves to dance and plays<br/>
guitar and keyboard/piano, sings, switch hits with a<br/>
bat and catches and pitches, can throw a frisbee,<br/>
tumble, does huge puzzles, does multi-digit multi<br/>
function math in his head faster than me.  He doesn&#39;t<br/>
have Thomas&#39; spatial or motor development problems. <br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t &quot;look&quot; any different than regular kids, and<br/>
are in fact both really handsome. (really!  I&#39;m not<br/>
just biased!  Their long thick eyelashes, Thomas huge<br/>
grey eyes and dimples and impish grin, Alex&#39; generous<br/>
mouth and square jaw and dimpled chin...)  Often on<br/>
short or casual observation they don&#39;t seem to act any<br/>
different than typical kids either.  All this makes it<br/>
harder not easier for ourselves, our families and<br/>
others to understand and see that they do have real<br/>
challenges, they are not just &quot;misbehaving&quot; and we&#39;re<br/>
not just some weird hovering overly involved parents.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry to be so long winded on this topic, but I<br/>
really felt like sharing the complexities that enter<br/>
into raising a child or children who have these types<br/>
of differences while maintaining unschooling and<br/>
attachment parenting principles.  It&#39;s a challenge to<br/>
be sure.<br/>

<br/>
I have two boys who fall on the higher end of the spectrum myself, but I <br/>
can&#39;t see us ever returning Rules after learning how to live by <br/>
Principles.  Every family is different, and every child on the spectrum is <br/>
different from every other one, but for us, radically unschooling has <br/>
worked wonderfully.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found it takes a LOT of discussion and prep work on my part, to help <br/>
the boys navigate.  We have developed a family rhythm that provides the <br/>
basic daily structure they need, and all plans and events are talked about <br/>
as thoroughly as possible beforehand to prepare them, and are talked about <br/>
again afterwards to &quot;debrief&quot; them too, to help them understand and process <br/>
the experiences they have had.<br/>
<br/>
Even things like sensory integration therapy and speech therapy has been <br/>
approached through an unschooling way, and seems to work well for my children.<br/>
<br/>
I think radically unschooling has literally saved the lives and spirits of <br/>
my boys.   They really *shine*!   You might check out Anne Ohman&#39;s Shine <br/>
With Unschooling list, too.  There are about 500 parents on there now who <br/>
have found that radically unschooling &quot;non-typical&quot; kids works best.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s a kind of structure, a way of interacting.  &quot;Family rhythm&quot; is  <br/>
a good term.<br/>
<br/>
Too many people, I think, read or hear &quot;no bedtime&quot; or &quot;they eat when  <br/>
they want to&quot; and imagine that the parents are ignoring the kids,  <br/>
never waking them up under any circumstances, never suggesting it  <br/>
might be a good idea to go to sleep earlier because of something  <br/>
happening the next morning, or the child not feeling good.  They seem  <br/>
to think that parents never make food or take kids to eat.<br/>
<br/>
Just half an hour ago we were talking about who needs to be where and  <br/>
do what when tomorrow.  None of us would normally spring a plan on  <br/>
the others, or knowingly withhold information about a need or  <br/>
appointment.  We&#39;ve reminded each other for so many years, it&#39;s  <br/>
normal and expected and comforting.  If someone said &quot;I have to be  <br/>
somewhere in half an hour&quot; that would be unusual and there would be  <br/>
apologies.<br/>
<br/>
We coach and discuss who needs what done how before we go places.  We  <br/>
all remind the others of lots of details.  I&#39;ll remind Keith to take  <br/>
his glasses if there might be some music to read, or something else  <br/>
to read.  Holly will remind me of bathroom-type-things.  Keith  <br/>
reminds us all about jackets.  We&#39;re not leaving anyone to make  <br/>
decisions and figure life out on his own.  We&#39;re all doing things  <br/>
together all the time.  We&#39;re aware when one of the others seems  <br/>
frustrated, or hungry, or is getting sick.  Keith asked if Marty&#39;s  <br/>
toe was still hurting, Marty asked if I had fun at Ramona&#39;s house, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Somehow sometimes those kinds of visions aren&#39;t conveyed.<br/>

I just watned to clarify, when I said that our boys &quot;will&quot; do this or <br/>
that thing (like when I was talking about the boys needing black and <br/>
white clothing rules/reminders/guidance) I wasn&#39;t saying that they <br/>
might, or they could, or I thought that they would.  I wasn&#39;t <br/>
saying &quot;Now if I don&#39;t make them do X-Y-Z they would do (insert <br/>

rhythm).  We just start winding down and doing more quiet things, and <br/>
usually by about 10:30 we&#39;re all tired and cozy and it is time to <br/>
sleep.  My teen daughter (16), though, thrives on nighttime, so she is <br/>
usually still bebopping around the house, enjoying the time to herself, <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yep, people on the autistic spectrum thrive on regularity of schedules.  It <br/>
greatly reduces anxiety and stress, and the tendency to obsess about what <br/>
is coming.   That is why we spend so much time &quot;briefing&quot; the boys whenever <br/>
there is an activity or change in plans.  Like I said, it is challenging <br/>
sometimes, but what a wonderful challenge!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think providing what they need to feel comfortable and secure is <br/>
antithetical to unschooling.   I have heard other parents of children with <br/>
autism insist that their children need a boxed curriculum because they <br/>
&quot;need structure&quot;, and they just can&#39;t believe that that type of structure <br/>
isn&#39;t really what the child needs or wants.<br/>

inclination is to do this in fact.  I have to fight with myself to <br/>
get to that level of involvement that my boys need, which is more <br/>
than a casual suggestion, a sincere serious request, or a heartfelt <br/>
plea even.  That works sometimes, but often is just not adequate.  <br/>
<br/>
For instance Thomas loves the cats.  He loves them to their <br/>
distress.  They cry and squirm and are in pain or frightened and he <br/>
refuses to put them down.  He has been constantly scratched up for <br/>
years now, always bearing marks of loving the cats too hard.  It <br/>
hurts and he bleeds and cries, but it&#39;s little to no deterrent.  <br/>
They run from him when they see him often.  We can ask, beg, and <br/>
command him to put a cat down or let it go, but it boils down to us <br/>
having to physically remove the cat from his arms.  He feels bad <br/>
about it, and says &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I just can&#39;t help it.  I try and try <br/>
but...&quot;  He asks us to help him stop himself.  So we stop him from <br/>
picking up the cats, he&#39;s just not allowed to.  He can love them as <br/>
long as they are willing to be stationary for him to do so wherever <br/>
they are.  That&#39;s just one example.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;None of us would normally spring a plan on the others, or knowingly <br/>
&gt;withhold information about a need or appointment.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Right, of course, that&#39;s just common courtesy with people you live <br/>
with, particularly in a close family.  We certainly do that too.<br/>
<br/>
But imagine someone calls one of you, kids or adults, and <br/>
says, &quot;Hey, we&#39;re having a birthday party for your good friend five <br/>
hours from now!  We forgot to let you know that we changed the day.  <br/>
We&#39;re really sorry!  Hope you can make it!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What would be their reaction?  I imagine, surprise, excitement, <br/>
maybe some irritation at the last minute notice, some rushing to get <br/>
ready maybe?  <br/>
<br/>
When this happened to Thomas, he flat refused to go.  He screamed <br/>
for an hour.  He was extremely unhappy for two or three more hours, <br/>
tense and stressed and doing self soothing behaviors.  Then in the <br/>
last hour or so, he began to adjust to the idea, began to accept the <br/>
possibility of going, then began to get excited about going.  We <br/>
were a little late, but he finally was able to go and enjoy himself, <br/>
in his way.   Of course that entire time before the party we were <br/>
hugely involved in trying to talk him through and get him to a point <br/>
where he could go.  We were totally exhausted by the time we <br/>
arrived, but he did get to go!  If he had been too upset to go, he <br/>
would have been angry and upset with himself about it for weeks <br/>
afterwards.<br/>
<br/>
Autistics just don&#39;t *do* flexibility, at least not easily.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  We&#39;re aware when one of the others seems frustrated, or hungry, <br/>
&gt;or is getting sick. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s another big difference for us.  Often with autistics they <br/>
are *not* aware of the needs, thoughts or feelings of those around <br/>
them, even when they seem obvious and clear to anyone else.  They <br/>
don&#39;t often consider how their actions affect others and even when <br/>
they are told, they often don&#39;t *get* it.  They can&#39;t see it and <br/>
don&#39;t understand how to address it if they do see it.  They also can <br/>
resist and ignore their own needs, even when directly having them <br/>
pointed out. <br/>

not burdened with all those official labels and pronouncements from <br/>
school Dr.s and therapists, or burdened with a sense of failure <br/>
because of all their differences and inability to fit into the <br/>
school models.  In fact I don&#39;t think they are largely aware of <br/>
their differences, and the ones they are are totally and wholly <br/>
accepted as being wonderful parts of their unique selves.  They <br/>
don&#39;t suffer self image problems.  I shudder to think how Thomas in <br/>
particular could ahve been damaged by a struggle through a school <br/>
system special education program.  Their friends are mainly other <br/>
kids who are developmentally different, or unusually patient and <br/>
tolerant, and our adult friends are the same kinds of folks.<br/>

my number two, she&#39;s the one with autism. The younger children are all (relatively) normal, <br/>
but as we say, what is normal anyway ;-) LOL!  I actually have more trouble with the typical <br/>
kids than my auties, auties are very straightforward with their needs, my younger kids are <br/>
more needy and complex. I&#39;ve had to learn alot since having them, esp the boys (4 and 2 <br/>
yo). <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; For a long time we didn&#39;t see Alex&#39; tendancies towards<br/>
&gt; autism spectrum difficulties because he&#39;s so very<br/>
&gt; different from Thomas and he&#39;s much more functional<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>YES! Ours are so completely different. Bre was dx&#39;d first, when she turned two, and Josh <br/>
was dx&#39;d three years later. I would say long run Bre will be more intense for us, but Josh <br/>
has been a puzzle for a while. I&#39;ve always loved the person he is, but the schools only <br/>
appreciate him for his high test scores. They both have sensory integration dysfunction, <br/>
but Bre&#39;s manifests as hyperactive disorder, high pain tolerance, remarkable balance, and <br/>
lack of fear. Josh is the opposite in every way, and it still amazes me that they both have <br/>
DSI but are so completely different. Josh is very laid back, likes to read and play games, <br/>
has been fearful of new things since toddling, is extremely sensitive to pain and emotion, <br/>
and can&#39;t stand straight without falling over. Seriously, once at the mall, I was amazed to <br/>
see him stand still, and his feet flew right out from underneath him. If you didn&#39;t know him <br/>
you&#39;d think he was faking for attention.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The three adults in our home are also somewhere on the<br/>
&gt; spectrum or shadow border of autism, including myself.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My husband and I are both spectrumy. strong interests, my hubby is very shy, and I am in <br/>
large situations. My dad is very aspie, and so is my BIL, although neither have been dx&#39;d. I <br/>
have sensory issues out the wazoo, and totally relate to all my kids&#39; issues with noise. I <br/>
thought everyone could hear light bulbs hum until the psych told me that&#39;s what was <br/>
causing Breanna&#39;s meltdowns at school! I would say that there was definately a strong <br/>
component, however, there must have been a trigger to cause a stronger dysfunction in <br/>
our oldest two, but not in the younger ones.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I feel that the difference between what constitutes a<br/>
&gt; difference and what is a dysfunction often boils down<br/>
&gt; to point of view <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I like that. I have a tendency to describe Josh&#39;s difference as just that, because he hides his <br/>
problems better. One thing that has led me to keeping my kids out of the system and at <br/>
home is the fact that labelling them seems to drag them down. And they don&#39;t need that. <br/>
Schools want to categorize the kids for simplicity, and I was seeing Bre suffer for it as well. <br/>
EVERY child is capable of learning, and the schools will not attempt to help those who are <br/>
more disabled. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It&#39;s been really hard for me, as an unschooler, to<br/>
&gt; find the balance between what my beliefs and<br/>
&gt; principles tell me about parenting and about<br/>
&gt; unschooling, and what my children actually need.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>yes! Where do you draw the line between trying to teach a child with a disability and <br/>
respecting their needs to learn on their own, express themselves, and do what they need <br/>
to do...for example, how long do we let Breanna rock? It&#39;s so touchy! Obviously she started <br/>
for a reason, self-soothing, but there comes a point where it must stop before she injures <br/>
herself or because she cannot eat. She needs to express herself, but not by scaring other <br/>
people. She gets frustrated, but she&#39;s not allowed to take it out on other people.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; These are not &quot;retarded&quot; or mentally deficient kids. <br/>
&gt; They are bright, have been called &quot;gifted&quot;, have a wry<br/>
&gt; and surprising (as in unusual) sense of humor, have<br/>
&gt; talents and skills. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep, even my nonverbal daughter has a high IQ (if you&#39;re into those things), both are very <br/>
intelligent, I&#39;ll be Josh is alot like Thomas, he spoke very early and like &#39;a little professor&#39;. I <br/>
must say I thought I was an excellent parent, he was the best mannered child, so insightful <br/>
and calm. LOL! It&#39;s all personality, and very little me. And I&#39;m learning to appreciate <br/>
excitable sword fighting little boys like my little ones! It&#39;s fun to have a big family with <br/>
such a large swath of interests and abilities.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for explaining so well to everyone a little more personal view.<br/>

was that when certain groups take themselves all off somewhere else,  <br/>
we lose the diversity of perspective and experience that makes for  <br/>
great discussions and help us ALL sort through our ideas.  My  <br/>
statewide homeschooling list lost a great deal when someone started a  <br/>
state list for homeschooling &quot;gifted&quot; kids, for example, and some of  <br/>
our most interesting posters went off there and cut back or entirely  <br/>
left the more general list.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, sometimes people are very quick to suggest another list and I  <br/>
think new people, especially, can easily take that as a suggestion  <br/>
that they are in the wrong place. So it seems useful to clarify, once  <br/>
in a while, that the underlying principles of unschooling are the  <br/>
same for gifted kids, sensitive kids, autistic kids, explosive kids,  <br/>
young kids, older kids, black kids, white kids, girls and boys, etc.  <br/>
Talking about how we all apply those principles in our very-different  <br/>
lives with our unique children is helpful in coming to a deeper  <br/>
understanding OF those basic principles.<br/>

There are quite a few of us with children that have different needs <br/>

when someone mentions their child has AS or SID and another list is <br/>
suggested, they may think that nobody HERE understands and that&#39;s <br/>
far from true. <br/>
When we adopted our three they had every dx under the sun...ODD, <br/>
ADHD, SID, PTSD, AS, depression, attachment disorder, developmental <br/>
delays and probably a few more I can&#39;t think of right now. They went <br/>

<br/>
&quot;Yes, but that won&#39;t work because...&quot;<br/>
--my kid is gifted<br/>
--my kid needs structure<br/>
--my relatives are all educators<br/>
--my husband is an engineer<br/>
--i have a strong work ethic (an actual quote from a recent e-mail  <br/>
from someone explaining to me that she would not be able to stay home  <br/>
with a child, because she had a strong work ethic)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Learning works at the edge of what a person already knows.  It&#39;s a  <br/>
building on and connecting to what&#39;s already familiar and interesting.<br/>
<br/>
No one can install knowledge into another person.  You can fill the  <br/>
air (or the screen, or a paper, or a painting, or a song) with ideas  <br/>
and clues, but each listener/reader/viewer is left to pick up and  <br/>
insert clues or not.  They can try those puzzle pieces into their own  <br/>
a-building universe and keep or reject them.  They can frolic for a  <br/>
moment or an hour with an idea they later abandon.<br/>
<br/>
People have come to more localized lists asking things like &quot;Is there  <br/>
anyone here with an eight year old girl?&quot;   Not even &quot;in the seven-to- <br/>
ten-year-old range&quot; but eight (8).  Girl.  WHY!?  It really shouldn&#39;t  <br/>
matter.  Choosing friends by birthday and gender is more like school  <br/>
than diagramming sentences is.  Finding a list of unschooling parents  <br/>
of eight year old girls would be too.<br/>
<br/>
No one but maybe a koala  or an aphid would eat all his food off the  <br/>
same tree for life.  Living in a fully wide world means not looking  <br/>
for a narrowly-defined corner of it.<br/>
