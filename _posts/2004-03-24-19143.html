<div id="ygrps-yiv-765219725">Janene says last night...&quot;mom, do you know you have a lot of behinds?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Uh, no, Janene, what do you mean?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well, you have behind your elbow, behind your knee, behind your hand, <br/>
behind your head, behind your back, and more!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I laughed and said it was a good joke.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s not a joke, mama, it&#39;s true, I was just lying here thinking about <br/>
it and it&#39;s true!&quot; <br/>
