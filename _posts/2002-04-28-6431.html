YES!!!!<br/>

And now that the other list isn&#39;t such a dark alley, I won&#39;t feel bad about <br/>

Have I missed responding to anything here?  I thought I was (AS usual) <br/>

<br/>
If a parent really does think learning stuff is boring, and that museums are <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1691765987">I gave a little talk at our support group&#39;s general meeting (my subject was<br/>
unschooling, others were covering school in a box, Charlotte Mason,<br/>
Montessori, and &quot;eclectic&quot; ((station break: the concept of &quot;eclectic&quot; drives<br/>
me mildly insane as the person talking was claiming to take the best from<br/>
everything, including unschooling, which is NOT possible part-time and I&#39;d<br/>
JUST got done saying that, but we&#39;re not here to talk about my control<br/>
issues and my deep and abiding compulsion to bite people who claim to<br/>
unschool everything but math and science, so let&#39;s move on...))) and when I<br/>
was done I said, &quot;Look, do what seems most sensible and natural to you, but<br/>
just keep in mind that if you or the kids DON&#39;T PASSIONATELY LOVE what<br/>
you&#39;re doing, you DO have other options, okay?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Any kid can unschool, but they need family involvement and support and<br/>
understanding-of-unschooling to do it. Or, as I said in my talk &lt;g&gt;, they<br/>
need car rides, the checkbook, and a parent who is paying attention to their<br/>
real interests, not the interests they&#39;d like them to have.<br/>

Why do you want to weed anyone out?  <br/>
<br/>
Whenever someone asks a question that has been beaten to death on the <br/>
message board and can be looked at there, I&#39;ve noticed you pointed <br/>
them in that direction.  That should prevent *dull* conversation.<br/>
<br/>
The reason I am here is because I truly want to *learn* to unschool.  <br/>
I&#39;m certainly not someone cut out for this but I am going to make it <br/>
work and I need the help of seasoned unschoolers like the people on <br/>
this list.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Swirling&quot; does not seem as important as &quot;child led&quot; on other <br/>
unschooling lists.  I want to learn to &quot;swirl&quot;, anyone can follow <br/>
a &quot;child led&quot; approach but not everyone can &quot;swirl&quot;.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Why do you want to weed anyone out?   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Because if I/we/people make assurances that something will work and others <br/>
try it based on our confident advice, and if it really doesn&#39;t work because <br/>
we were insufficiently informative OR (in the scenario I&#39;m thinking of) <br/>
because they weren&#39;t suited to it, didn&#39;t have the <br/>
ability/resources/aptitude, we may contributed to some big frustration.  <br/>
We&#39;re trying to help families, not frustrate the hell out of them.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes people will stay on lists like this for two or three years and ask <br/>
100 questions and still really, truly not get it.  Sometimes people will come <br/>
and say &quot;I did what you guys said, and six months later my kids won&#39;t do <br/>
ANYTHING.  I keep watching them and waiting, but they haven&#39;t done ANY <br/>
schoolwork.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If I were going to teach music, I wouldn&#39;t want to keep a student and take <br/>
money if it really looked like he didn&#39;t have the physical coordination or <br/>
the ear or the rhythmic sense to tell one style of music from another.  It <br/>
would be wasting his time and his money, and wasting my time, AND making me <br/>
look like a bad teacher.  If he takes lessons for a year or two and there&#39;s <br/>
not much progress, it would be a kindness for me to suggest something more to <br/>
his liking.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1165883175">Worse yet, there are people who don&#39;t even really like to be with their<br/>
kids.  <br/>
<br/>
One mom I know wondered why her little girl wanted to go back to school<br/>
and then it came out that the mom had to have her alone time and had to<br/>
have her time to paint and just couldn&#39;t stand kids games.   Well, school<br/>
might look pretty good to someone who&#39;s mom was simply too busy to be<br/>
with her, or too bored.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe parents can change once they understand what unschooling is?<br/>
How long does it take to understand?   Would someone too *dull* really<br/>
turn everything around?  <br/>
<br/>
I just don&#39;t know how helpful it is to say anyone can unschool.  Anyone<br/>
who really delights in their children maybe, but not just anyone.   <br/>
Maybe just people who haven&#39;t been bitten by Pam.  <br/>

<br/>
From the point of view of a child who wants to play, a parent who does NOT <br/>
want to play must seem dull.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard parents (not unschoolers, but homeschooling parents) say they <br/>
cannot stand ANY kids&#39; TV shows.<br/>
<br/>
I read a guy who had otherwise been highly recommended (who wrote the essay a <br/>
couple of months back about going to his kid&#39;s school to talk to the teachers <br/>
about a test or something) who was complaining mightily that Sesame Street <br/>
was still teaching the alphabet and the numbers 1-20 after 30 years.  WELL <br/>
DUH!  Did he expect them to follow HIS personal learning curve??<br/>
<br/>
Tangent.  But still...  <br/>

to be some process for getting over long held ideas about parenting but<br/>
when the &quot;they need structure, they have disorders, they&#39;ll only ever eat<br/>
paper clips&quot; thing starts, my head wants to explode.  <br/>
<br/>
The truth is, if you ask this kind of person why they must parent this<br/>
way, they really don&#39;t know.  They&#39;ll have some vague answer about how<br/>
&quot;if we lived in a perfect world, yada, yada&quot;  but they really have no<br/>
idea why they think the way they do.  THEN, if you offer up a new way to<br/>
look at things, you&#39;ve attacked them.  <br/>
Maybe this is just one horrible flashback to that other list.<br/>
<br/>
I really fall down when it comes to the folks who can only find <br/>
wrongness and badness and failure in their kids.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess everyone has to start somewhere.  If they&#39;re looking at their<br/>
kids and thinking there must be a better way, then they should have a<br/>
place to ask all the questions they need to.  And like Tuck said, if they<br/>
can stand the answers they get then good for them.  <br/>
<br/>
Are you really thinking of changing the intro to the list.  My<br/>
suggestion... &quot; If you say something unbelievably stupid we WILL attack<br/>
you and if you whine about it we will send someone to your house to beat<br/>
you up.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I may be feeling a little hostile here.  I&#39;m expecting a huge influx<br/>
(reflux?) of in laws next month and NOT looking forward to the<br/>
questions... &quot;when is he going to go to school?&quot;   When hell freezes<br/>
over,  &quot;does he like his hair that long?&quot;   No,  we force him,  &quot; When is<br/>
he going to eat meat?&quot;  When all the paper clips are gone.<br/>

lessons, even if he doesn&#39;t progress to become a full-fledged musician?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If we were having a fun hour together every week and the parents didn&#39;t mind <br/>
that there might not be much progress ever, if any, I would just want to be <br/>
honest with the parents about that.  Otherwise the child will say &quot;I took <br/>
lessons for years, and can&#39;t remember a thing about this instrument,&quot; or the <br/>
parents might (if the teacher isn&#39;t clear), say &quot;WHY can&#39;t he play now?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s English instead of music, and if I trust the public school model, I <br/>
can tell the parents something like this:<br/>
<br/>
Because he doesn&#39;t apply himself.<br/>
Because he&#39;s not paying attention to directions.<br/>
Because he doesn&#39;t finish his homework.<br/>
He&#39;s too shy to contribute in class.<br/>
You don&#39;t help him with his homework.<br/>
<br/>
If you teach English and a kid doesn&#39;t get it whatsoever, the system is set <br/>
up so that it&#39;s not the teacher&#39;s fault. <br/>
<br/>
Private music lessons, though, aren&#39;t that way.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Isn&#39;t that what unschooling is all about? (Among other things, obviously <br/>
;-)) Exposure and dabbling and trying things out?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What if they don&#39;t dabble and try things out?  That&#39;s my whole question. What <br/>
if the family does NOTHING, can&#39;t do anything, doesn&#39;t realize other people <br/>
are doing something or that there is &quot;something&quot; to do?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Using things for *your* <br/>
benefit and not necessarly for someone else&#39;s expected outcome? Don&#39;t <br/>
parents get *some* benefit from reading all about unschooling?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering about some parents who seem to get no benefit from reading all <br/>
about unschooling.  Or they ask a question, ignore or misunderstand the <br/>
answer, do some weird version of nothing, and come back a year later and tell <br/>
us we were wrong and gave bad advice.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Aren&#39;t the parents likely to take something away that will be of <br/>
benefit for both?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If so, no argument.<br/>
My question is about people who seem not to take anything beneficial away.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;It would be wasting his time and his money, and wasting my time, AND <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;making me look like a bad teacher.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;Are we afraid of looking like bad unschooling teachers?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I am.<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m teaching diving and I have one champion lifeguard swimmer/scuba diver, <br/>
and one gangly non-swimmer, and I give them the same instructions and send <br/>
them out on the board...  I&#39;m a bad diving instructor!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Couldn&#39;t he still do both? Music and other things? As long as no one told <br/>
him he sucked at music, couldn&#39;t he still get some value from it? Wouldn&#39;t <br/>
it be better for *him* to decide this was something he didn&#39;t want to <br/>
pursue?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, yes, yes and yes.<br/>
What if he thinks the method is what will eventually work, and that if he <br/>
pays his $15 and comes to class and doesn&#39;t lose his notbook and keeps <br/>
strings on his guitar that eventually this will lead to playing along with a <br/>
bluegrass band (at least), have I misled him?   <br/>
<br/>
If a family thinks that keeping kids home and letting them explore on their <br/>
own (and maybe their entire image of &quot;letting them explore on their own&quot; is <br/>
just as brief and black-and-white as that phrase just appeared in this <br/>
e-mail) will eventually lead to their knowing enough to support themselves, <br/>
or get into college, and if fifteen years down the road their kids knows ZIP, <br/>
we were bad teachers.  <br/>
<br/>
Is part of teaching or coaching weeding out those who won&#39;t make it?<br/>

&gt; I&#39;d prefer that we just start unschooling the parent. Sounds like the&#39;ve got<br/>
&gt; some serious school induced damage there. I wouldn&#39;t send anyone away with<br/>
&gt; giving it a shot.<br/>

Your right of course, that sounded very broad, but I&#39;ve only ever come<br/>

I don&#39;t assume all parents are this way, maybe it sounded like I do.  I<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I like what Anne Ohman wrote on the message board:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; there is SOME impetus that makes us LOOK for answers when we feel something is<br/>
&gt; not just right. And if you don&#39;t have that impetus, then you are just not<br/>
&gt; ready for the answers yet.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So I think coming to unschooling people need to have the feeling that<br/>
there&#39;s something not right in what they&#39;re doing with homeschooling and<br/>
there&#39;s something about unschooling that appeals to them.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe wanting learning to be fun also?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure wanting what unschooling seems to be offering is enough because<br/>
you need the motivation to do what needs done to &quot;get&quot; unschooling. It&#39;s not<br/>
a formula that can be applied and just happen.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s enough to help people coming directly from school.<br/>
Wanting a child out of school isn&#39;t the same as feeling there&#39;s something<br/>
wrong with schoolish ways. There may just be a feeling there&#39;s something<br/>
wrong with how the school is implementing schoolish ways.<br/>
<br/>
I think part of the problem is parents hearing the &quot;child-led&quot; part and<br/>
getting an image of Thomas Edison pursuing his own studies in the basement.<br/>
<br/>
So what traits do parents who don&#39;t like museums and messy art have that no<br/>
unschooler has had? Maybe it&#39;s that they don&#39;t like spending time with their<br/>
kids?<br/>

those things but is too lazy to get out of the chair to go do them? Or do <br/>
you mean they won&#39;t take it the extra step to also read about it?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have a long haired 5yo ds.  Thanks to unschooling I have given up a <br/>
lot of control, and am still working on letting go of more.  I <br/>
figured when people started assuming he was a girl at first glance, <br/>
he would ask for his hair to be cut.  Nope.  <br/>
My dh has long hair and a good friend of my older son(8) has long hair<br/>
(he&#39;s 11), so my 5yo has cool role models.  He is very confident <br/>
about just stating he is a boy, when people mistake him.  <br/>
I wish I were better at it.  I feel uneasy for people when I know <br/>
they are confused by his clothes and his &quot;boyness&quot;, but also feel <br/>
weird about offering the information to them(that&#39;s up to my son).  I <br/>
have heard disparaging comments about my older ds friend and his <br/>
hair, when people didn&#39;t know I was the mother of my 5yo.<br/>
It&#39;s a stange thing how much of a lesson this has been for me.<br/>
It has been a forced process of letting go of what others think, and <br/>
realizing how much it really doesn&#39;t matter.<br/>
