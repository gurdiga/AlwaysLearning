I think it&#39;s hugely affected many people&#39;s choice to unschool or to leave <br/>
behind institiutional type thought that makes people dependant on &quot;experts&quot;.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
