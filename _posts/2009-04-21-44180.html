<div id="ygrps-yiv-408368937">Toby(11) is travelling to London and Paris this summer, and he has a question I don&#39;t have an answer for.  Since some of the people on this list live in Europe, I was hoping to get an answer here.<br/>
<br/>
Do kids in England and France play Pokemon, YuGiOh, Chaotic, Magic the Gathering, and other similar card games?<br/>
<br/>
Also, he&#39;s never been on a plane before, and he&#39;s pretty nervous about the flight over to Europe.  He is old enough to remember 9/11, and I think that is part of what is bothering him.  He&#39;s also afraid of heights.  If you have any suggestions to help with his anxiety, we would love to hear them.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
Kirby worked at a gaming shop and was big into Pokemon when he was  <br/>
younger, so he knows that they do!   The kids who collected cards in  <br/>
those days and had collected them all next wanted to collect French  <br/>
and German cards.<br/>
<br/>
In Paris, their cards would be in French, but if he played with his  <br/>
own and they used their own, that might work out just as well as it  <br/>
would at home.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure about Chaotic and Magic.  Kirby would know for sure, but  <br/>
he is without a phone, and he&#39;s also asleep. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>

Is he going alone?<br/>

It&#39;s easy to get NOT window seat.  And if going to Europe there will  <br/>
probably be a middle section far from windows.   If you&#39;ll be with him  <br/>
I have ideas.<br/>
<br/>
If you respond that he&#39;s going alone, I&#39;d have other ideas.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-186374304"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Is he going alone?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>He&#39;s going with a Student Ambassador group.  There&#39;s approximately 50 kids and 7 teachers.  His particular teacher is assigned a group of seven children, and thankfully, she&#39;s an art teacher, so she&#39;s a bit more laid back than a core teacher would be (says the former math teacher).  He&#39;s been meeting with his teacher and the other six kids in his group once a month, but the other kids and teachers will be complete strangers.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, once he gets on the plane and gets going, the other kids in the group will more than likely have him distracted.  I really think the three hour wait and the initial take off are going to be the hardest for him.  Thanks to the post 9/11 reguations, I can&#39;t help him with the wait in the airport.  I guess we need ideas he can use himself, and maybe some ideas the teacher can use if he starts getting really upset.  He&#39;s the kind of kid who stands in line for a roller coaster and then backs out at the last minute, so I am a little worried he will refuse to get on the plane, and I won&#39;t be there to distract him or talk him through it.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;ll be quite pleased to hear about Pokemon.  Hopefully some of the shops he goes into in France will have cards.  If so, I know what he will be buying with all of his Euros.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

might be his particular travel buddy.<br/>
<br/>
Also we find Nintendo DS to be one of the best waiting around tools.<br/>
<br/>
I guess don&#39;t leave the airport parking lot until after the plane has taken <br/>
off. Also he doesn&#39;t have to turn his cel phone off until the plane is ready <br/>
for take off, so you could talk him through it that way.<br/>

ticket.  As in, walk up to the counter and say &quot;give me a one-way<br/>
unrestricted on your last flight of the day to New York&quot;, or wherever...any<br/>
flight that departs several hours from now and isn&#39;t sold-out.  Hand over<br/>
your credit card, they hand you a boarding pass (yes, a walk-up last-minute<br/>
unrestricted ticket will be very expensive).  Go through security screening<br/>
(you&#39;ll probably get special screening, since it&#39;s last-minute and one-way),<br/>
do whatever you need to do in the gate area (meet your family, see them off,<br/>
go to the Red Carpet club, whatever), then go back to the counter and get it<br/>
refunded.  It will probably take a few days for the refund to hit your card.<br/>

I haven&#39;t read this whole thread, so maybe this has already been discussed but I was able to go right through security with ID when a good friend of ours sent her son to visit. Apparently she was also able to go down to the gate with him as well. She paid extra for having him assisted as an unaccompanied minor (even though he was 13 or 14 at the time since it was his first trip alone). I&#39;ve read through some of the airline policies and it looks like they allow an adult through at both ends of travel if a child is listed as &quot;Unaccompanied Minor&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
Yes.  They REQUIRE the parent or other person to show up there.   And  <br/>
they&#39;ll probably charge extra.   Holly had that status when she went  <br/>
to Europe, and they didn&#39;t take the greatest care of her, but I&#39;ve  <br/>
heard better stories from other people.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Tina,<br/>
My 14 year old just flew United from Chicago&#39;s O&#39;Hare airport to Atlanta as an unaccompanied minor - no extra fees or badges were required.  The security agents were more than willing to issue a gate pass for me AND all three of her younger brothers, but the only thing I really needed was to make sure she made it through the security screening.  We had decided last minute to not check her suitcase when they tried to charge an extra fee - so I had her perfume and suntan lotion in my purse and would not have been able to get through without all of us returning to the parking garage first.  Since we had not even known it was an option to go to the gate, she had planned to go through alone anyway.  She was able to use her cell phone at the gate and even on the plane while they waited on the ground for an extra hour or so delay for a storm to clear up somewhere in the area they were to fly through.  This would give you a way to be in contact with him right up until departure.<br/>
<br/>
Last spring when we flew to London, we were on Virgin Atlantic airlines and each seat had its own viewing screen and hand held controller with access to movies, music, and games.  There was also a channel to track exactly where we were at any point during the flight.  They showed how many miles traveled, how far left, and an estimated arrival time - kind of cool to check out occasionally. Perhaps, you could check the airline your son is flying to see if there will be similar distractions for Toby to look forward to.<br/>
<br/>
Would he be interested in bringing a camera to document the trip for you?  Does he have a particular friend among the kids he has already met?  <br/>
<br/>
Sounds like an exciting trip!!! Hope he enjoys the experience!!!<br/>

 <br/>
Yes, lots of kids in England certainly play YuGiOh and Pokemon.  I  think <br/>
I&#39;ve heard about someone who plays Magic the Gathering too, though  am less <br/>
sure of that info.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-375454046">Thank you to everyone for all of the information about your experiences with children and airline travel.  I&#39;ve only seen my dh off at the airport, so I was not aware there was an option for parents to accompany children right up to the boarding gate.  I will definately find out more about this option.<br/>
<br/>
I have met the kids in his group, and there is one boy who seems to be cut from the same cloth as Toby.  I&#39;m hoping he will be able to keep Toby distracted, and he won&#39;t need me.  However, I would like to be available should he start to get upset because he can become irrational, and I&#39;m not sure a teacher will notice the warning signals.  It&#39;s good to know it may be an option for me to be there for him if he needs me.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for the information.<br/>
