<div id="ygrps-yiv-823136501"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That&#39;s for their guests...they don&#39;t actually think that they are elves.  :-P&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>From the site:<br/>
Some think that enacting a story sounds silly or childish, but many people fail to take into account that we all enact stories every day. We are told stories by our culture, our families, and even ourselves. We go into therapy because the stories we&#39;re told don&#39;t make sense when compared with what we observe, and we&#39;re called crazy or antisocial if we don&#39;t believe the stories anymore. Well, we&#39;re not buying it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The bit about the elves caught my eye because we recently had a discussion of truth and lying on our local hs list.  A mom was talking about how her very young child (3-5) was lying a lot and how the mom was *teaching* her not to lie.  One of the examples the mom gave was about leaving a library storytime and telling her child that leprechauns aren&#39;t real.  It evolved into discussion of Santa, Easter bunny, etc. and what parents say to kids about such stories.<br/>
<br/>
Now, it&#39;s not that I believe in leprechauns.  But I don&#39;t think I need to make a big issue of insisting they don&#39;t and never did exist either.   I also find it ironic that some adults would make an issue of elves and other such creatures not being real, yet tell their children that their religious beliefs are the absolute truth.<br/>
