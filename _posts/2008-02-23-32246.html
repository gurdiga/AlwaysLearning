<div id="ygrps-yiv-2063984603">Hi everyone.  I mainly lurk on this site, but have an upcoming <br/>
situation that I need advice on.  I am fairly new to unschooling <br/>
(since this past fall) and have been reading everything I can about <br/>
unschooling (books, websites, discussion groups, etc.).  So your <br/>
advice would be very helpful here.<br/>
<br/>
My ds(5) and dd(8) have never been in any kind of school.  We have <br/>
always done things together as a family.  My children enjoy being at <br/>
home where everything is familiar.  When we went on vacation last <br/>
fall (when I had first &quot;discovered&quot; the concept of unschooling) ds <br/>
and dd had fun until the first night (we were camping and they were <br/>
having so much fun).  They missed their bed and all their familiar <br/>
things and smells of home.  By the second night, dd and ds were <br/>
crying, wanting to go home.  Also dd ended up being sick with a sore <br/>
throat and a fever, so we went home the next day.<br/>
<br/>
At Thanksgiving, we went to my parents&#39; house which is only about 50 <br/>
minutes away.  We spent the night on Wed. night so that we would have <br/>
more time to spend with family (I have 11 brothers and sisters, most <br/>
of them married with kids!).  Both kids were sad at night and wanted <br/>
to be home.<br/>
<br/>
Then, this past December, the kids and I went to visit my sil and her <br/>
two children.  They live only an hour away.  We spent the night so <br/>
that we could get up in the morning and do some fun Christmas stuff.  <br/>
That night, both kids cried and said they wanted to be home in their <br/>
own beds and they missed their daddy. <br/>
<br/>
Now here is the problem.  My niece who lives about 7 hours away is <br/>
getting married.  Dd has been asked to be a flower girl and she is so <br/>
excited.  I&#39;ve been talking a bit about it and ds is getting <br/>
anxious.  Dd is excited right now, but I know once we get there and <br/>
night time comes around, she will get homesick.  We had planned for <br/>
my dh to take vacation time that week and then we could plan to do <br/>
some other fun stuff as well (we will be heading to southern part of <br/>
Mississippi).  The wedding is not until June.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess I am asking for help in how to deal with this situation.  I <br/>
want to know how I can help them feel safe and also experience places <br/>
other than home.  I know they will have fun doing all the &quot;stuff&quot; but <br/>
it is night time that gets hard.  How do others deal with <br/>
homesickness?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Melissa</div>

Keep them busier until they are super ready for sleep. Maybe you&#39;re  <br/>

<br/>
I had something kind of like this happen just this week.  The background is that my step-father passed away and we had a lot of family in the area.  We were spending a couple of nights up at his old mountain house in Ruidoso (about 45 minutes away), and while getting ready to go I asked Richard to do a few things, it seemed like everything I asked him to do got lost in translation.  He kept forgetting what I said, or doing the opposite, and once while I was letting the dog out he accidentally locked me out of my mom&#39;s house.  I was getting really frustrated.  We were in a hurry, so in my frustration I really didn&#39;t want to stop loading the car and talk to him calmly, but I did and I am so glad.  I apologized for blowing up, and we talked about how things like grief and anger and stress and hunger and tiredness and everything else affect each of us differently,  and I told him that with me, though I have gotten much better in the last few years, any one of those things can cause me to be short tempered, but all of them together make it really bad!   <br/>
<br/>
Part of my frustration I think came from what I am used to from my son.  He usually seems much older than his 12 years, he is dependable and responsible, more so than many adults that I know.  So when he was having a hard time, and I was super stressed, I forgot how to deal with it.  He had lost his grandpa, he was very tired, I had fed him but since people were bringing food to us it wasn&#39;t what he was used to, I was rushing him, and over the last few days I hadn&#39;t spent nearly as much time with him as he is used to.  It is a wonder he did as well as he did!  In fact he was still doing pretty great, I was the one with the issues!  <br/>
<br/>
So while we were in Ruidoso, there were so many people around, and everyone wanted to talk and I really didn&#39;t want him to get pushed to the side again.  I made sure to go and find him fairly often and hug him, bring him food or drinks, make sure he had enough to do (we brought favorite video games and movies, as well as toys), talk to him for a while privately or bring him around with me to talk to people, whatever he needed.  It really made a difference, for both of us.  I told myself that I was trying to take care of him, but really going and spending some time with him between people really lowered my stress level, which meant I was better with him.  <br/>
<br/>
I found that most people really understand if you excuse yourself to check on kids or spend some time with them, and if they don&#39;t, so what?!  <br/>
<br/>
Another thing that helped were those little familiar things from home.  I take his pillow and favorite blanket on trips right off of the bed without washing them, so they smell like home.  His favorite stuffed animals are important, I always make sure to take one or two.  We have a portable DVD player, and we always bring his favorite movies, and often I will hit the $5 bin at Walmart and grab one or two new movies to surprise him with on trips.  He is really into the movie &quot;300,&quot; so I got him the History Channel&#39;s show on DVD about the real battle that the movie is based on, and recently I found another older movie about the same battle and I had been hanging onto it, so we took it up there.  <br/>
<br/>
Time with me and the little familiar things from home seem to be the best things for my son when away from home or during stressful times.  <br/>

I like those ideas.  I often take my own pillow on trips.  If I wake  <br/>
up just a little, I&#39;m more likely to believe I&#39;m just sleeping (at  <br/>
home, in my bed) than if I wake up with an unfamiliar pillow (the  <br/>
texture, the smell) and I&#39;m startled.<br/>
<br/>
Familiar water is good, too.  When we camp we take plastic milk  <br/>
cartons nearly filled with water, frozen, and when it thaws out a few  <br/>
days later it tastes like home, instead of the water wherever we are  <br/>
which can range from just unfamiliar to sick-making.<br/>
<br/>
Sleeping with  my children and letting them go to sleep holding my  <br/>
hand seemed to help, too, when we were in unfamiliar places, even  <br/>
when they were older and not sleeping with  me at home.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>***********<br/>
I believe that being in a strange place is probably the biggest <br/>
thing, here.  Both dc are very intuned to smells, sounds, etc.  Also, <br/>
something that just occurred to me, we have a routine that we follow <br/>
each night and when we are somewhere other than home, the routine is <br/>
off.  It is not that I started off with formulating some sort of <br/>
routine, it just kind of evolved.  <br/>
<br/>
Each night, we all go get on our comfy p.js.  I put in a &quot;night-<br/>
night&quot; video for dc (something calming at their request and only <br/>
about 30 min. long) and prepare them a &quot;night-night&quot; snack to eat <br/>
during the video -- something simple like apples and peanut butter or <br/>
banana slices and carrot sticks - you get the picture.  While they <br/>
are watching the video, I get their room ready - turn back the <br/>
blankets a bit, warm up the rice bags in the microwave (they&#39;ve had <br/>
those since they were babies for upset tummies! now they like them on <br/>
their toes!) and place them under their blankets, get all <br/>
their &quot;friends&quot; together (special stuffed animals, blankies), turn on <br/>
the crickets (noise machine), dim the light.  After the video, we all <br/>
(me included) brush teeth, they climb in under the warmed up blankets <br/>
and I read to them.  Then it&#39;s lots of kisses and hugs.  I then turn <br/>
on their classical music cd, turn off the light and turn on the night <br/>
light, sit between them and rub and pat their backs until they fall <br/>
asleep.  <br/>
<br/>
It is all so calming and at the end of a busy day, they both really <br/>
look forward to bedtime.  After writing all this, I realize that I <br/>
can not replicate this scenerio when we are away from home.  <br/>
<br/>
For instance, when we visited their cousin, I tried to have things as <br/>
much like what they have at home, but out of respect for the cousin, <br/>
we followed HIS routine, which looks very different from ours.  The <br/>
music is different, the night light is a lot brighter, there is no <br/>
story time (although I did read anyway but my nephew really didn&#39;t <br/>
want it because that is not part of his routine), dc were sleeping on <br/>
the floor (even though I brought their blankets and &quot;friends&quot; and <br/>
pillows, the floor just feels so different than their own bed).  I <br/>
still sat between them and patted their backs, but they still missed <br/>
home.<br/>
<br/>
When we went camping, the entire night time routine was gone.  We <br/>
listed to real crickets (imagine that!), the stars were our night <br/>
lights, and we read stories by the fire.  But after we got in the <br/>
tent, they began crying wanting to be home.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>These instances were before I learned about unschooling.  I am sure I <br/>
probably did try to talk them out of their feelings.  That is one <br/>
thing I will do differently.  Even at the time, it seemed wrong to <br/>
try to help them &quot;get over&quot; it instead of helping them acknowledge <br/>
the feelings and to allow them to &quot;feel&quot;.  But at the time, that is <br/>
all I knew.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I am sure that is probably part of it as well.  They seem to be <br/>
having so much fun with cousins, but they are used to being with me <br/>
most of the time.  Maybe when all is still and it is time to sleep, <br/>
they really do feel a little abandoned, even though they were having <br/>
a good time with cousins.  I didn&#39;t think about it that way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-959135632">True, being overtired because of overstimulation does interfere with  <br/>
my sleep (and my kids&#39;). Still, they might need more physical activity  <br/>
- because a lot of times when you&#39;re visiting with people there is a  <br/>
lot of hanging around and not enough running around.<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re getting overtired, then help them get more down time  <br/>
throughout the day - even little 10 minute increments can help a lot -  <br/>
go for a little walk together, for example. Or even go hang out in the  <br/>
bathroom alone for 5 or 10 minutes &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Music or familiar stories can help a lot - do they have mp3 player  <br/>
with earplugs so they can listen to music or books while they go to  <br/>
sleep?<br/>

&gt; &gt; While I partially agree with Pam about keeping them super-busy, I<br/>
&gt; also think<br/>
&gt; &gt; that you must consider that for some people (children or adults!)<br/>
&gt; becoming<br/>
&gt; &gt; over-tired interferes with sleep and creates its own stress.<br/>
&gt; &gt; There are certainly lots of ideas to consider and try.<br/>

&gt; And being super tired does interfer with esp. ds&#39;s sleep. He is a<br/>
&gt; very intense child.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2103222651">Melissa , I read something I really liked at a friend and also unschooling mom&#39; blog that you will relate to:<br/>
   <br/>
  &quot;Anyhow, over at Derfwad Manor for Slow Cook Thursday the poem is an Emerson poem. It is an evocation of Carpe Diem, a sentiment I&#39;ve always loved but never managed to live. <br/>
<br/>
Write it on your heart<br/>
that every day is the best day in the year.<br/>
He is rich who owns the day, and no one owns the day<br/>
who allows it to be invaded with fret and anxiety.<br/>
<br/>
Finish every day and be done with it.<br/>
You have done what you could.<br/>
Some blunders and absurdities, no doubt crept in.<br/>
Forget them as soon as you can, tomorrow is a new day;<br/>
begin it well and serenely, with too high a spirit<br/>
to be cumbered with your old nonsense.<br/>
<br/>
This new day is too dear,<br/>
with its hopes and invitations,<br/>
to waste a moment on the yesterdays.<br/>
