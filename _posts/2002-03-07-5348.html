Well, yeah. I plan on using it as suggestions, and because I like knowing<br/>
some background about a movie. I especially liked the &quot;Movies We Don&#39;t<br/>
Recommend&quot; part, since there are several great ones there as well. How could<br/>
I support anyone who puts all three Mandy Patinkin movies they mention on<br/>

other unschoolers!!<br/>
The workshops that would interest me the most would be hands on <br/>
definitely...I like being asked to do strange things that make me think.<br/>
I especially love things that give me new ideas, or fun things to try.<br/>
<br/>
I had heard about the TX conference and it had sounded really interesting. I <br/>
thought the name of it was Natural Child or something though? Maybe it&#39;s a <br/>
different one after all.<br/>
There is a wonderful Ren Fair over in the Houston area that runs April <br/>

I&#39;ve been once to the Texas Renaissance Festival near Houston, and have <br/>
camped on that site twice for big SCA events.  <br/>
<br/>
Dallas to Houston is too far for driving, though.  <br/>
<br/>
For those of you in small states, just because New Mexico and Texas touch <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean we can zip over there for the weekend very easily.  I could <br/>
drive four hours in any direction and still be in New Mexico (six or seven in <br/>
some directions).  We drove from Albuquerque to Houston once in a bus with 25 <br/>
people.  Took 25 hours.  We joked that if there&#39;d been fewer people it <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have taken as long.<br/>

&gt;discuss the benefits of video games.  I need to get that organized soon.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sandra, would you have any interest in sharing ideas on this topic?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve given it a fair amount of thought - perhaps too much to go on<br/>
about in the group.  But, a tidbit...<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve read &quot;Flow : The Psychology of Optimal Experience&quot;<br/>
by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, but it is an excellent analysis of how the mind<br/>
works under stress, and he puts forward the idea that the optimum mental<br/>
state is one where stress (i.e. demand on a particular faculty of the mind /<br/>
body)<br/>
is pretty precisely balanced with skill level and the capabilities of the<br/>
individual.<br/>
We usually call activities producing this state &quot;games&quot; by the way.<br/>
<br/>
This optimum performance point is reached in sports (he uses tennis as a<br/>
good<br/>
example), chess, reading, even conversation.  I can tell you that all of my<br/>
best work<br/>
as a programmer is done within flow (otherwise known as &quot;the zone&quot;) where<br/>
there is not only a high degree of organized, productive, mental effort, but<br/>
also<br/>
a timeless and largely ego-less experience of &quot;fun&quot; (for want of a better<br/>
term).<br/>
A day of work can be totally refreshing, if I can overcome the institutional<br/>
obstacles to getting into, and staying in, Flow.<br/>
<br/>
This applies to video games, to my point of view, because video games are<br/>
one<br/>
of the only places that my son can _reliably_ enter the flow state and<br/>
remain there<br/>
for lengthy periods of time.  My dw used to think it was frightening that<br/>
our son, even<br/>
when he was four would &quot;zone out&quot; with a game for several hours at a time,<br/>
not<br/>
eating, not drinking, not speaking.  But I recognized it as &quot;zoning in&quot; -<br/>
hitting<br/>
that place of experience where you are optimally performing and using (while<br/>
improving) your skills.  At times this is (I don&#39;t want to get melodramatic)<br/>
blissful.<br/>
<br/>
So, in our culture, I think we reflexively wonder, since it&#39;s very pleasant<br/>
(and we can do it<br/>
without consuming something - eek!) must it not be &quot;habit-forming&quot; and<br/>
therefore<br/>
bad?  This, assuming we can not ALL agree on the benefits as we might with a<br/>
running<br/>
habit or workout habit, or painting habit, or gardening or music composition<br/>
habit.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I think that the experience of flow itself is good for the brain, good<br/>
for the<br/>
child.  It uses the brain the way it is designed to operate optimally - or<br/>
at least<br/>
one of it&#39;s optimal modes.  What seems to get lost is the idea that video<br/>
games are<br/>
&quot;games&quot; first.  High tech, but still games.  For &quot;fun&quot; - fun comes at all<br/>
different<br/>
intensity levels, and perhaps the most intense is flow.  The thing about<br/>
flow is that<br/>
it is personal.  Two tennis players are not playing &quot;together&quot; if they are<br/>
in flow.<br/>
Neither are two chess players.  They are in their own solitary worlds.<br/>
Basketball players<br/>
and other team players have a different kind of optimal level - they always<br/>
have to keep<br/>
some attention available to monitor environmental conditions, signals, and<br/>
so on. For<br/>
some reason this lower intensity level is less disturbing to onlookers.<br/>
<br/>
But video games are solitary and we see the flow for what it is - total<br/>
absorption<br/>
in a solitary productive/recreational activity.<br/>
<br/>
Institutions can&#39;t exercise good control over people in a flow state and so<br/>
they break<br/>
it up, by changing the demands, creating distractions, adding elements of<br/>
boredom<br/>
that break up the focus.  I think schools do this and I think workplaces<br/>
often do<br/>
this.  In my industry, we can get around it much of the time.  But you still<br/>
have phones,<br/>
meetings, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Anywho - games (especially video games) train one&#39;s mind to enter the flow<br/>
state<br/>
and maintain it.  This is why my son can kick my butt at every game, without<br/>
exception,<br/>
that we have every played together, including challenging ones like Jedi<br/>
Power Battles<br/>
and Ace Combat 04.  He has already learned to enter and maintain a flow<br/>
state, which<br/>
is optimal for learning as well as performance, better than I have with<br/>
about 35 years of<br/>
practice.<br/>
<br/>
Why are games good for kids?  I think that is the essence of why video games<br/>
are NOT<br/>
bad.  Well, some are bad, but some are clearly good - great in fact.  The<br/>
same can be<br/>
said for anything.  Books, movies, even people.<br/>
<br/>
Video games are so solitary, and that is scary for people who, like me, grew<br/>
up immersed<br/>
in crowds of (mostly) strangers.  There&#39;s no authority figures to tell you<br/>
whether you&#39;re<br/>
right or wrong - there&#39;s only the rules of the game and the score.  But<br/>
being comfortable<br/>
with solitude, is just being comfortable with reality.  We can connect, we<br/>
can relate, but<br/>
at the end of the day you are who you are and that is just one person.  I<br/>
don&#39;t think<br/>
giving a child the choice of solitary pursuits is such a bad thing.  If they<br/>
play non-stop<br/>
for 30 days, it&#39;s getting out of hand.  If they are wasting away to bones<br/>
and flesh while<br/>
achieving Yoda-like levels in one game, ok, it&#39;s too much.  But my<br/>
observations have shown<br/>
that these games have a natural life-cycle.  My 7yo can complete a &quot;typical&quot;<br/>
game in a<br/>
weekend, with lots of time for other activities mixed in when he loses the<br/>
ability to<br/>
sustain flow.<br/>
<br/>
I think learning to recognize and sustain flow is learning to operate your<br/>
mind in one of<br/>
it&#39;s primary optimal states.  Openness, such as meditation is another<br/>
optimal state, very<br/>
different from flow - perhaps it&#39;s diametric opposite...<br/>
<br/>
Flow completely transcends all boundaries of the game, games in general, and<br/>
this state,<br/>
when cultivated as a personal capability can be one of the most powerful<br/>
capabilities<br/>
one can develop.  As an adult, I use it every day - from programming, to<br/>
composition<br/>
to polishing the car.<br/>
<br/>
So much for the flow tidbit.  Just putting out a feeler to see if this is<br/>
something, you, Sandra,<br/>
or any others want to discuss in more detail offline, or slowly here.  Any<br/>
interest?<br/>

at least I seriously question why I do or believe what I do!<br/>

I think this is more of a learning style thing. Some people don&#39;t like <br/>
figuring new things out from the directions, which are presented in a linear <br/>
fashion. That&#39;s not how they learn best. Lots of people, my son and dh <br/>

won&#39;t even look at the directions and usually has the basics figured out <br/>
before me.  That&#39;s what happened with our new digital camera.  But I <br/>
struggle with the directions and usually figure out stuff he hasn&#39;t even <br/>
thought to try.  When we combine our strengths instead of fighting them, we <br/>

<br/>
My kids love any Link and Zelda game, they played the heck out of Banjo <br/>
Kazooie, and they like Harvest Moon, but I don&#39;t think they have it for the <br/>
64.  The Harvest Moon that got the most play was Super Nintendo, but now <br/>
they&#39;re all over the PS 2 version.  (Gameboy Harvest Moon gets passed around <br/>
a lot, and they&#39;ve all played it.)<br/>
<br/>
If he has extra controllers and friends over, Mario Kart 64 seems to be the <br/>
group favorite.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Most of our games have been bought used, but the kids will save allowance to <br/>
buy new games, too.<br/>

<br/>
I thin it&#39;s probably neither of your two choices.  (Why do people narrow <br/>
their thinking down to either-or so quickly?)<br/>
<br/>
We have a computer game by the learning company called Treasure Mountain.  <br/>
You catch elves, answer math questions, get clues and then get tokens hidden <br/>
under the right objects.  The objects you choose have to have two out of <br/>
three of the aspects of the key object (which you determine by earning clues <br/>
you get by buying nets, catching elves, and answering questions).  So if the <br/>
&quot;right&quot; answer is three round trees, you also benefit by clicking on three <br/>
triangular trees, or two round trees, etc.  It&#39;s a cool reasoning exercise.<br/>
<br/>
For Marty, when he was little, he played it a whole different way.  He <br/>
clicked on every object or set of objects.  If he got a token, he had a clue. <br/>
 He clicked until he knew where the key was.  He totally ignored the elves.   <br/>
But clicking costs a coin.  Where&#39;d he get the coins?  He discovered what the <br/>
rest of us never needed to know.  If you were totally broke, the game would <br/>
leave you money on the ground.  So Marty was using the welfare money and <br/>
making it entirely a deductive reasoning game.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think Marty learned less than Kirby and Holly did.  <br/>
<br/>
Marty is also more likely to put things together without the directions--just <br/>
throw all the parts and bolts out there and see the thing.  This is a good <br/>
skill.  <br/>

<br/>
Celebrity wrestling?  But I&#39;d whoop him too soon, and we&#39;re supposed to speak <br/>
for an hour and fifteen minutes.   <br/>
<br/>
What we have most in common is our big interest in Buddhism and our belief <br/>
that if you live mindfully things unfold calmly and without you even trying.  <br/>
Only I do the frenetic ADD junkfood way, and he does the quiet vegetarian <br/>
way.   Same results, different environments.  That&#39;s why he thought we should <br/>
speak together.<br/>
<br/>
I liked the thing we did in Portland, but it was not structured.  It was <br/>
questions we&#39;d both answer, and then discuss back and forth.  Maybe that, <br/>
with TV as one of the questions (so after five minutes we could go to other <br/>
things! &lt;g&gt;).  But I don&#39;t want to be confrontational with him either.<br/>

Marty&#39;s the only one here who does them, and so I didn&#39;t know that! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Marty is the most like his dad who is a code-checking engineer too.<br/>
And Kirby is most like me, and he&#39;s Mr. Social Organization.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday Keith was making a wrap-front cloth thing to go over his armor.  <br/>
Kind of a cross between a gi jacket and a medieval surcoat.  And some edges <br/>
will have another color of facing (to the outside--a bordure) but there are <br/>
sleeve openings and skirt-slits which won&#39;t be faced that way, and so I was <br/>
suggesting twill tape facings, or turned hems and reinforcing patches at the <br/>
tops of the slits, and that was all AFTER the discussion of the neck cuts and <br/>
the direction of the material.  <br/>
<br/>
My husband can sew, and I can sew, and he&#39;s more engineerly in general, but <br/>
when it comes to cloth he likes my ideas but I have a harder time explaining <br/>
it than doing it.  But he wants to do it himself.<br/>
<br/>
When he made a folding case for a six-part pop-apart bench he made which he <br/>
wanted a bag for, but really wanted one envelope for each part on a long <br/>
roll-up-and-tie &quot;envelope,&quot; that was a LOT of cloth engineering.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In so many areas of life, there are no &quot;directions.&quot; At least none handy.<br/>
And for many tasks or problems, there are many solutions.  Intuiting the<br/>
many solutions and choosing the most efficient, fun, or aesthetically<br/>
appealing makes &quot;problems&quot; a source of constant joy.<br/>
<br/>
If you naturally tend toward this mode of being, it feels unnatural to<br/>
follow directions.  Most  problems (maybe all - haven&#39;t seen &#39;em all yet)<br/>
contain their solutions - you just need to look at them right.  This, btw,<br/>
is most assuredly not something I learned in school.  It&#39;s something school<br/>
didn&#39;t quite beat out of me.<br/>
<br/>
The mental mode where one looks at a problem and visualizes / imagines /<br/>
invents a solution is very different than the skill of reproducing a set of<br/>
steps in sequence as told to you - i.e. &quot;The&quot; solution, the answer.<br/>
<br/>
Moving out of this preferred and strongest mode is not fun. It&#39;s work, come<br/>
to think of it.  And I&#39;m not a big fan of work. It&#39;s to be avoided if one<br/>
has a choice.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if I have to do something really important (well I have a specialist do<br/>
it and pay them with money I make doing what I&#39;m good at, but if I am stuck<br/>
somewhere or something...) then I will seek &quot;The Solution&quot; and follow the<br/>
directions. And I probably won&#39;t like it.  But, I acknowledge both modes are<br/>
conducive to survival and success.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I (a non-direction follower) can, if I&#39;m painted into a corner, do many<br/>
things in ways that are not at the core of my nature.  I can adapt to the<br/>
task and adopt a new mode.  I try to show my son (who is prone to a mode of<br/>
seeing like my own [only his is wild and free in a way mine never was]) by<br/>
example, that there are times when you just have to let someone else tell or<br/>
show you how to do something.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the discomfort of operating in a mode you are not accustomed to is<br/>
a growth process.  The important thing to grasp is that you have a situation<br/>
that calls for a mode-switch as soon as possible, once you&#39;re there.<br/>
Closing in on 40 and I am still working on this one...<br/>
<br/>
(Skydiving - that&#39;s one I won&#39;t be figuring out on my own.)<br/>
<br/>
Following the directions takes patience and discipline, two things I am a<br/>
little short of.  But that doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t see and admire the beautiful<br/>
efficiency, the pure elegance, of doing something without the effort of<br/>
trial and error.  I love watching someone do something like put together<br/>
hardware that requires detailed instruction-following.  Just like I love<br/>
watching people do lots of things I am not so good at doing.  I like reading<br/>
short e-mails too ;)<br/>

were for Conor&#39;s first ever Transformer. He was 4, I think. After I <br/>

transformed it easily. I never tried to explain anything like that again. <br/>
