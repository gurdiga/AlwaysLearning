<div id="ygrps-yiv-1527369186">It&#39;s so fun to see what some of you look like! If I<br/>
ever get it together to get some film developed (from<br/>
my undeveloped pile) and figure out how to scan in a<br/>
photo, then maybe we&#39;ll be on there too oneday.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-95549685">My daughters are pretty young &lt;g&gt;. 7 and 4. I&#39;m 35, so I&#39;m probably on the<br/>
younger side of the Moms here, though as time goes on, I expect I&#39;ll have to<br/>
get used to that not being so.<br/>
<br/>
But my picture&#39;s not up at the website yet, and I don&#39;t look young -- I was<br/>
never carded as a 21 year old, no one guessed when I started working that I<br/>
was 16, not 19 or 20. I married a guy 10 years older so I wouldn&#39;t die of<br/>
screaming boredom. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
