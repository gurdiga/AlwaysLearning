<div id="ygrps-yiv-1482823176">Gever Tully, a VERY cool guy and founder of the Tinkering School--which isn&#39;t a school at all, but a place to play with tools and build neat stuff, has invented a new term.  Dangerism--which is about how a society decides what is &quot;dangerous.&quot;  He did a TED talk about the 5 dangerous things every kid should do, if that tells you where he&#39;s coming from.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
I thought some might be interested, since he&#39;s one of the only voices out there calling our society on how paranoid we are about safety.<br/>
