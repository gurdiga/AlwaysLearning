in between two golf courses and has a small itty bitty stream <br/>
running through the backyard as well as a small pond.<br/>

In any case, the house is very large and I&#39;d love to have people <br/>

in between two golf courses and has a small itty bitty<br/>
stream <br/>
running through the backyard as well as a small pond.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, the house is very large and I&#39;d love to<br/>
have people <br/>
come on over,,,,,,whenever!!!  That&#39;s after we move in<br/>
of course.<br/>
<br/>
We would love to be a home base for other unschooling<br/>
families <br/>
to gather.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1395433789"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;At the end of the month we will be moving into a<br/>
&gt; *large* house<br/>
&gt; with another Unschooling AP/TCC family.  It&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; mini-shared living<br/>
&gt; community and we are looking to add another family (or<br/>
&gt; two) to the<br/>
&gt; mix.  If anyone is interested, let me know!!   The<br/>
&gt; house is located<br/>
&gt; about 5 to 10 min. northeast of Burien (just south of<br/>
&gt; Seattle).  It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; in between two golf courses and has a small itty bitty<br/>

Well, it took us 6 days to drive from NJ to WA this past<br/>
September.  Hubby drove the Ryder truck and pulled one<br/>
of our cars behind it, while I drove our other car with two <br/>
kids and two guinea pigs!   I was impressed that the kids<br/>
did soooo well!!   <br/>
<br/>
I suppose you could do it in 4 days if you&#39;re just driving<br/>
a regular car and not hauling anything behind you!  :-)<br/>

I keep forgetting how big America is. We&#39;ve barely ventured more than<br/>
hundred miles from home so far.<br/>
Good thing about england. You can be just about anywhere in less than a<br/>
day.<br/>
