<br/>
  But while we&#39;re on the subject - how old do you think a child should be before being left alone.?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s my problem, too.  The military regulations tell me I can&#39;t leave my<br/>
son alone until he&#39;s 11.  Period.  Not even for 5 minutes to go to the<br/>
neighbor and get somethinig.  I think that&#39;s dumb.<br/>
<br/>
At 11 I can leave him for 3 hours, as long as he has access to an adult.<br/>
Now, how he&#39;s supposed to be ready for that, I don&#39;t know, since he doesn&#39;t<br/>
get to build up to it.  But that&#39;s the army for you.<br/>
<br/>
I disagree with it, and I&#39;ve challenged this regulation recently.  No answer<br/>
yet, which didn&#39;t really surprise me.  But besides being reported to Family<br/>
Advocacy and Social Services, I can also lose my command sponsorship to stay<br/>
in Germany and be kicked out of housing.  So I try to behave.  I refuse to<br/>
commently in a public forum about how successful I&#39;ve been at behaving....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-75100511">Yes, it&#39;s illegal here. My problem though is the guy upstairs. He&#39;s been supportive of Coyotes Corner (our home business); however, I strongly suspect he has Aspergers Syndrome - for those that are unfamiliar - Aspergers folks are very high functioning in certain areas, w/ little or no social skills.<br/>
That translates into poor choices on his part  - trust me - we have many examples!! For example - he&#39;ll knock on the door forever - one night Brianna & I were lying down in the far bedroom reading. He saw the van - he knocked for over 20 minutes, while calling on the home phone and the cell phone - and calling our dog &quot;Come on Teah, come here girl&quot; - so Teah started barking, etc. <br/>
Brianna finally answered. <br/>
He said he wanted to make sure we were ok.<br/>
I fear that if I left her alone and he heard her and Teah, he would be knocking and calling - perhaps calling the authorities - to make sure she&#39;s ok.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve pointed out that no one is obligated to answer a phone or a door.<br/>
He doesn&#39;t get it.<br/>
<br/>
The fact of the matter is, I have no one to leave Brianna with, so I end up taking her or not going.<br/>
I guess that&#39;s okay - heck, soon enough, she&#39;ll outgrow this stage and I&#39;ll miss it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, and if you&#39;re going to be leaving your kid home alone in the near <br/>
future, go out and get a book called &quot;Disaster Blasters&quot; by Laura Szabo-Cohen <br/>
and Karin Kasdin.  Great book about what to do if you&#39;re home alone and the <br/>
toilet overflows or whatever.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>It is hard for the Army though.  They are responsible for everyone, <br/>
especially when in another country.  They sponsor you.  So they make up the <br/>
regulation to protect everyone.  It is hard to make up different rules for <br/>
each individual.  And oversee all individual cases.  But believe me don&#39;t get <br/>
into the Family Advocacy Social Services part of things.  Just behave.  <br/>
Jackson was clinic commander in Augsburg and Frankfurt, before they both <br/>
closed so was involved in those issues.  Although I believe the Army Social <br/>
Services is much better than civilian, and much more objective.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway just my 2 cents.....behave over there.<br/>
