Well, this accurately describes our home.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t even know if I get what mathematics is, --a language, a philosphy, a<br/>
human endeavour, just like music, a tool--???  The math part of me seems to be<br/>
one area of  which was badly damaged, if not partially destroyed by schooling.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d use different metaphors for each of our family, but we all have trouble with<br/>
this.<br/>
I have a math squirel living in my brain.  When something mathlike wakes it up,<br/>
it  hides ( but it can sometimes find) math  nuts, but more often than not, it<br/>
just scurries around looking for something and anxiously leaping away from<br/>
perceived dangers.<br/>
My husband has a lead helmet which automatically locks down over his head.  This<br/>
math mask has a lifelike face painted onto it, but....<br/>
Our son (13) seems still to inhabit the math part of his brain (whatever that<br/>
is). Math seems to be located on the top floor  of a big house and our son runs<br/>
around inside, slamming doors against intruders and bad smells. I hope that he<br/>
will escape the familial math curse if we at least just leave him alone.  I&#39;d<br/>
like to have a few things on the shelves for him to find, though, and right now<br/>
we have nothing in this area.  I don&#39;t think.<br/>
<br/>
And yet,...my husband reads chess and bridge books to relax. He begins every day<br/>
by playing a few hands of bridge at the kitchen table.  Isn&#39;t that math?  One<br/>
adult son is a fine musician and this younger son is a computer nut, and both of<br/>
those require some kind of math sense, right?<br/>
<br/>
I read Carry on, Mr. Bowditch last week and got something about the role of math<br/>
(trigonometry, right?) in navigation and all that.  I was very proud of myself.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, we may even be doing math all the time, but we don&#39;t recognize it as<br/>
math unless it creates math anxiety.  I just don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
I seem unable even to write coherently about this.  The point of this email was<br/>
simply to ask if there are one or two or morebooks which math folk recommend<br/>
which might gently introduce our family to the wonderful world of mathematics<br/>
(Hah!).  And start a new section of our library.<br/>
<br/>

P.S.  I haven&#39;t introduced myself yet. I lurk here and there, and have been an<br/>
on-again-off-again subscriber at Unschooling-dotcom for a couple of years, as<br/>
I&#39;ve been an on-again-off-again reader of GWS over the years.  I usually mull<br/>
things over either in solitude or by talking loudly and excitedly at members of<br/>
my family about what I&#39;ve been reading.<br/>
We live in Toronto, Ontario.  &quot;We&quot; is myself, my husband and our son, who is<br/>
learning &quot;at home and elsewhere&quot;.</div>

&gt; human endeavour, just like music, a tool--???  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Music&#39;s a tool?<br/>
(I know; in some ways it serves as one.)<br/>
<br/>
I think of music as a language, and as a kind of sculpture in the air.<br/>
It&#39;s a medium.  (Not as compared to a small or a large, but as in a means of <br/>
expression, as language is, as painting or drawing is, as massage or dance or <br/>
architecture is.)<br/>
<br/>
As English has lots of forms--simple baby talk, repetition of traditional <br/>
forms (poems, jokes, riddles, fairy tales, urban myths), communication at <br/>
higher and lower levels, discussions of God or of bugs, of pathos or <br/>
silliness, giving directions, scaring bad guys away--the whole range of <br/>
SPOKEN English can be experienced without even touching on reading and <br/>
writing.<br/>
<br/>
Same with music.  <br/>
<br/>
George Harrison just died.  As far as I know, he couldn&#39;t read music.  (Maybe <br/>
he could later, but couldn&#39;t at first.)  He was undoubtedly a musician.  He <br/>
&quot;composed&quot; music, but he did it aurally and not on paper.  He knew that <br/>
language as a native speaker, and he knew it well, but he was &quot;illiterate.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There are people who understand math well and use it in their own mental <br/>
ways, but if they don&#39;t recognize the traditional format of the formula the <br/>
&quot;real mathematicians&quot; use as their proof and model, they&#39;re considered <br/>
&quot;illiterate.&quot;  Only with math, much more than with music or English, there <br/>
seem to be professionals and teachers who don&#39;t realize or don&#39;t acknowledge <br/>
that there is a huge world of math outside their written language for it.<br/>
<br/>
There are music teachers too, though, who want NOTHING to do with any playing <br/>
by ear.  They consider it gypsy lowlife nonsense for people to just make <br/>
music up, or to waste their time &quot;playing wrong&quot; when they should go to a <br/>
teacher and be taught JUST how to hold a guitar, or JUST how to use a violin <br/>
&quot;right.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
There are English teachers who shun street rhymes or jokes or regional <br/>
dialects in favor of &quot;reading level&quot; and appreciation of &quot;good literature&quot; <br/>
(meaning the same things the teacher was forced to read and told how to <br/>
appreciate).  <br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers can get away from those small, narrow, formal traditions.<br/>
<br/>
Holly is really good at all kinds of mathematical thinking.  She can sing <br/>
too.  So I see her doing music by ear (and she&#39;s learning fiddle, and she <br/>
dinks out melodies on the piano and remembers them later, and sees the <br/>
patterns), but I don&#39;t teach her &quot;notation.&quot;   And she&#39;s started figuring out <br/>
averages in her head (because if she joins a Five Crowns game late we <br/>
&quot;average her in&quot;) and she does tricky calculations in ways she has created on <br/>
her own.  I don&#39;t teach her &quot;notation&quot; except what she asks for.<br/>
<br/>
But the advantage with Holly, who is lately ten, is that she has NO fear <br/>
whatsoever of math or music (and in fact doesn&#39;t even see them as different, <br/>
separate things as school kids so clearly do).  The patterns in numbers and <br/>
the patterns in music are both fun and sweet for her.  <br/>
<br/>
I was good with math but bad with notation and so was shut out of <br/>
mathematical progress and acceptance in school, and it DID scare me.  I did <br/>
okay on SAT&#39;s, but creditted it to being a good guesser.  I don&#39;t have a good <br/>
memory for numbers, but that doesn&#39;t keep me from figuring out fresh <br/>
questions.  (I just need to write down the final figures.)<br/>
<br/>
Mostly I&#39;m thinking that the dad in question might be seeing only the written <br/>
notation of math as real math, and not the mathematical thinking and <br/>
pattern-finding.<br/>
<br/>
Keith&#39;s here; he says he might have the second part of his math writing in <br/>
e-mail at work and will check today when he goes in.<br/>

perfectionism.)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>For me it is all of the above.<br/>
<br/>
It is a language that was developed by humans to help us understand our world.<br/>
It is definitely the language that is used to describe the physics of our<br/>
world.  And since it was developed by humans it&#39;s definitely a human <br/>
endeavour!<br/>
<br/>
It is a philosophy in its logical underpinnings.  In fact Pythagorus and many<br/>
other early mathematicians were also philosophers.  (I think, therefore I<br/>
am by Rene Descartes, a medieval mathematician and philosopher.)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also a tool.  And it is related to music in many ways.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure what to recommend.  I find a lot of it fascinating but I&#39;m <br/>
also a mathematician!  I learned early in my life that I thought differently<br/>
about math than those around me - I liked it!!<br/>
<br/>
You could start with the history of mathematics - how it got started, how<br/>
it developed, etc.  Check out Marvin Gardner&#39;s books - he writes (or wrote)<br/>
a column in Scientific American about mathematical games.  In fact any <br/>
mathematical game book might be a good starting point.<br/>
<br/>
Also what interests do you and your family have?  Carpentry and quilting<br/>
both involve geometry for example!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and let me know if I can help in any other way.<br/>
