<div id="ygrps-yiv-858725754">My son, Lewi is 7. At the moment he has a real fascination for, and <br/>
interest, in knives. As much as I possibly can I have been nurturing <br/>
this interest. I&#39;m finding it difficult though because of the safety <br/>
issues involved. He likes the look of sharp blades and is interested <br/>
in what they&#39;re used for. He constantly admires the ones in our <br/>
kitchen drawers and gets them out and puts them on our bread boards <br/>
to look at.I&#39;m very present with him when he&#39;s handling the knives <br/>
and have given lots of info about how to handle them safely etc. <br/>
<br/>
There are a couple of things that concern me. One is the reactions <br/>
I&#39;m getting from others who aren&#39;t understanding why he&#39;d be <br/>
interested in something like a knife. They have alot of fear about it <br/>
(which I totally understand)  and have questioned him and me about <br/>
why the interest is there. The other is my concern for his safety and <br/>
the safety of others if he happens to show them the knives. I trust <br/>
that he won&#39;t do anything dangerous with them on purpose and again, <br/>
I&#39;m very present when this is happening, but am worried nonetheless, <br/>
that an accident could happen. Not sure where my boundaries need to <br/>
be with it all. I&#39;ve talked to him about the inportance of not <br/>
walking around with them etc and that the drawer is a really safe <br/>
spot for them unless we&#39;re cutting up vegies etc with them. <br/>
<br/>
He also desperately wants to purchase big types of knives -at the <br/>
moment it&#39;s  a machette. We&#39;ve had lots of discussion about this, and <br/>
that will continue. I&#39;m really feeling like I need to say no to alot <br/>
of these sorts of things though because of his age. We&#39;ve been into <br/>
the King Of Knives store (while we were in Sydney) and he found a <br/>
sword letter opener that he wants to buy. This would be safe as it&#39;s <br/>
not really sharp. We&#39;re talking about getting a small pocket knife as <br/>
well. My dad has found him an antique scythe that he&#39;s going to hang <br/>
up on his wall in his room and we&#39;ve been to Allens and got a nice <br/>
new knife set for the kitchen which includes a meat cleaver <br/>
(something he&#39;s loved for awhile now). I&#39;m feeling like I&#39;m doing as <br/>
much as I can to help him get what he needs but the machette etc <br/>
feels like it&#39;s way too much at the moment. He&#39;s very upset about my <br/>
decision and my saying no to it. I guess I just needed to hear what <br/>
some of your thoughts are on this and whether I could handle this in <br/>
a much better way.<br/>
<br/>
thanks so much<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Why wouldn&#39;t he be interested in knives? Kids are often interested <br/>
in adult tools - its part of how they learn about the world, after <br/>
all. If these doubters in your life would be more reassured by <br/>
schoolish methods, you might want to look into some Montessori <br/>
resources which recommend teaching children as young as 3 to handle <br/>
knives. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Is there something in particular he wants to use a machette for? <br/>
They&#39;re really great for cutting brush, if they&#39;re sharp. Its <br/>
helpful to have someone who knows how to use it to show you what to <br/>
do - how to slash away from the body, rather than down towards the <br/>
legs. <br/>
<br/>
How physical is your guy in general and what&#39;s his &quot;body sense&quot; <br/>
like? Some kids are really coordinated and have the ability and <br/>
sense to be careful - even when doing complex and dangerous things. <br/>
That&#39;s a much more important factor than age. My mom managed to sew <br/>
through her finger tip on a sewing machine, once, but I&#39;ve helped <br/>
several young children over the years use sewing machines without <br/>
mishaps. <br/>
<br/>
Is he more interested in doing useful things with knives etc, <br/>
or &quot;fighting&quot; with them? If its the latter, is he interested in <br/>
taking lessons of some kind or joining a club? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-833981776">I know Im rarely on here but I just thought I would comment.I have 4 <br/>
sons and all of them have had a pocketknife by the time they were <br/>
6.The reason is the fascination that knives seem to have on kids.I <br/>
found my firstborn in the backyard with a huge kitchen knife when he <br/>
was five.I needed to come up with a good solution so they wouldnt <br/>
feel the need to steal a kitchen knife and hide with it.I buy them <br/>
one of those cool Swiss army knives with all the tools on it.They had <br/>
a few safety rules that I had to remind them of every now and again.I <br/>
showed them how to use it and watched them from the corner of my eye <br/>
to make sure they used the knife correctly..But seriously no bad <br/>
accidents ever.Aside from that first cut finger.I did have to make a <br/>
rule no open bladed knives till they were older.Couldnt find an <br/>
option for that one.My middle son has a whole collection of knives <br/>
now and even some nice swords.<br/>
The only stitches we ever had was when one of my sons decided to use <br/>
a razor blade to make a mini teepee and it slipped..But lesson <br/>
learned and only 5 stitches.<br/>
My sister inlaw went ballistic when I bought her son a pocketknife <br/>
for his 8th birthday.He loved though(LOL)..<br/>

I stapled through my finger with a mini stapler once.<br/>
 <br/>
I remember wanting to shave my legs when I was a young teen. I kept asking  <br/>
my mother, but she kept telling me I was &quot;too young&quot;. I remember wondering how  <br/>
thick the hair on my legs had to get before I was &quot;old enough&quot;, but I got <br/>
tired  of waiting, so I snuck my mom&#39;s disposable razor and started shaving my <br/>
legs  dry. I didn&#39;t know to use anything as a lubricant/barrier and it didn&#39;t <br/>
occur to  me until that first draw up my leg that there would be hair in the <br/>
razor. I was  pretty certain I shouldn&#39;t go again without cleaning the hair off, <br/>
and having no  experience with razor blades, I took a square of toilet paper, <br/>
laid it over  my finger and wiped the blade sideways. Ouch. Luckily, I was <br/>
well-versed in  nursing my own wounds by that point and since I *was* often in <br/>
need of Neosporin  and band-aids, my mother didn&#39;t think to ask any questions. <br/>
Come to think of it,  I made lots of mistakes sneaking things I wanted to do <br/>
but wasn&#39;t  *allowed*....<br/>

Thank you so much , Pam for the reassurance. I know there&#39;s nothing wrong with his interest. It&#39;s hard  when others have those undertones around him though. I need to just be assertive and say straight out (when someone says something) that this is OK and it&#39;s normal and he&#39;s not going to be an axe-murderer LOL! But, seriously I think that&#39;s what some people are worrying about - he must want to kill something or someone to be interested in something like knives. It reminds me of something someone&#39;s said on the list recently, just because they&#39;re into TV doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re going to want to watch horror and violence; and just becasue they like magazines doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re going to want to read porn.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much it&#39;s helped me find my voice again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-408396411">Thanks Meredith for your great advice. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;How physical is your guy in general and what&#39;s his &quot;body sense&quot; <br/>
like? Some kids are really coordinated and have the ability and <br/>
sense to be careful - even when doing complex and dangerous things. <br/>
That&#39;s a much more important factor than age&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Lewi&#39;s coordination in terms of throwing things and his awareness of people around him when he&#39;s got a long stick etc is still developing. So I do feel concerned about a machette for that reason alone. But maybe I could find someone who has one who could spend some time with him showing him how to use it and practicing abit for awhile.<br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t really want it for anything other than the look. That&#39;s what he keeps saying anyway. I&#39;m sure though that he&#39;d love to cut long grass etc too because he loves to do that with the gardening implements we have (it&#39;s darn helpful too! LOL).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
  Why wouldn&#39;t he be interested in knives? Kids are often interested <br/>
  in adult tools - its part of how they learn about the world, after <br/>
  all. If these doubters in your life would be more reassured by <br/>
  schoolish methods, you might want to look into some Montessori <br/>
  resources which recommend teaching children as young as 3 to handle <br/>
  knives. <br/>
<br/>
  &gt; He also desperately wants to purchase big types of knives -at the <br/>
  &gt; moment it&#39;s a machette. We&#39;ve had lots of discussion about this, <br/>
  and <br/>
  &gt; that will continue. I&#39;m really feeling like I need to say no to <br/>
  alot <br/>
  &gt; of these sorts of things though because of his age.<br/>
<br/>
  Is there something in particular he wants to use a machette for? <br/>
  They&#39;re really great for cutting brush, if they&#39;re sharp. Its <br/>
  helpful to have someone who knows how to use it to show you what to <br/>
  do - how to slash away from the body, rather than down towards the <br/>
  legs. <br/>
<br/>
  How physical is your guy in general and what&#39;s his &quot;body sense&quot; <br/>

  That&#39;s a much more important factor than age. My mom managed to sew <br/>
  through her finger tip on a sewing machine, once, but I&#39;ve helped <br/>
  several young children over the years use sewing machines without <br/>
  mishaps. <br/>
<br/>
  Is he more interested in doing useful things with knives etc, <br/>
  or &quot;fighting&quot; with them? If its the latter, is he interested in <br/>
  taking lessons of some kind or joining a club? <br/>

Thanks for this suggestion and your reassurance that all&#39;s normal in our world. I&#39;m definitely going to get Lewi a Swiss army knife. ASAP.<br/>

  I know Im rarely on here but I just thought I would comment.I have 4 <br/>
  sons and all of them have had a pocketknife by the time they were <br/>
  6.The reason is the fascination that knives seem to have on kids.I <br/>
  found my firstborn in the backyard with a huge kitchen knife when he <br/>
  was five.I needed to come up with a good solution so they wouldnt <br/>
  feel the need to steal a kitchen knife and hide with it.I buy them <br/>
  one of those cool Swiss army knives with all the tools on it.They had <br/>
  a few safety rules that I had to remind them of every now and again.I <br/>
  showed them how to use it and watched them from the corner of my eye <br/>
  to make sure they used the knife correctly..But seriously no bad <br/>
  accidents ever.Aside from that first cut finger.I did have to make a <br/>
  rule no open bladed knives till they were older.Couldnt find an <br/>
  option for that one.My middle son has a whole collection of knives <br/>
  now and even some nice swords.<br/>
  The only stitches we ever had was when one of my sons decided to use <br/>
  a razor blade to make a mini teepee and it slipped..But lesson <br/>
  learned and only 5 stitches.<br/>
  My sister inlaw went ballistic when I bought her son a pocketknife <br/>
  for his 8th birthday.He loved though(LOL)..<br/>

  &gt; My son, Lewi is 7. At the moment he has a real fascination for, and <br/>
  &gt; interest, in knives. As much as I possibly can I have been <br/>
  nurturing <br/>
  &gt; this interest. I&#39;m finding it difficult though because of the <br/>
  safety <br/>
  &gt; issues involved. He likes the look of sharp blades and is <br/>
  interested <br/>
  &gt; in what they&#39;re used for. He constantly admires the ones in our <br/>
  &gt; kitchen drawers and gets them out and puts them on our bread boards <br/>
  &gt; to look at.I&#39;m very present with him when he&#39;s handling the knives <br/>
  &gt; and have given lots of info about how to handle them safely etc. <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; There are a couple of things that concern me. One is the reactions <br/>
  &gt; I&#39;m getting from others who aren&#39;t understanding why he&#39;d be <br/>
  &gt; interested in something like a knife. They have alot of fear about <br/>
  it <br/>
  &gt; (which I totally understand) and have questioned him and me about <br/>
  &gt; why the interest is there. The other is my concern for his safety <br/>
  and <br/>
  &gt; the safety of others if he happens to show them the knives. I trust <br/>
  &gt; that he won&#39;t do anything dangerous with them on purpose and again, <br/>
  &gt; I&#39;m very present when this is happening, but am worried <br/>
  nonetheless, <br/>
  &gt; that an accident could happen. Not sure where my boundaries need to <br/>
  &gt; be with it all. I&#39;ve talked to him about the inportance of not <br/>
  &gt; walking around with them etc and that the drawer is a really safe <br/>
  &gt; spot for them unless we&#39;re cutting up vegies etc with them. <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; He also desperately wants to purchase big types of knives -at the <br/>
  &gt; moment it&#39;s a machette. We&#39;ve had lots of discussion about this, <br/>
  and <br/>
  &gt; that will continue. I&#39;m really feeling like I need to say no to <br/>
  alot <br/>
  &gt; of these sorts of things though because of his age. We&#39;ve been into <br/>
  &gt; the King Of Knives store (while we were in Sydney) and he found a <br/>
  &gt; sword letter opener that he wants to buy. This would be safe as <br/>
  it&#39;s <br/>
  &gt; not really sharp. We&#39;re talking about getting a small pocket knife <br/>
  as <br/>
  &gt; well. My dad has found him an antique scythe that he&#39;s going to <br/>
  hang <br/>
  &gt; up on his wall in his room and we&#39;ve been to Allens and got a nice <br/>
  &gt; new knife set for the kitchen which includes a meat cleaver <br/>
  &gt; (something he&#39;s loved for awhile now). I&#39;m feeling like I&#39;m doing <br/>
  as <br/>
  &gt; much as I can to help him get what he needs but the machette etc <br/>
  &gt; feels like it&#39;s way too much at the moment. He&#39;s very upset about <br/>
  my <br/>
  &gt; decision and my saying no to it. I guess I just needed to hear what <br/>
  &gt; some of your thoughts are on this and whether I could handle this <br/>
  in <br/>
  &gt; a much better way.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; thanks so much<br/>
  &gt; <br/>

<br/>
I guess it&#39;s like so many things these days, parents not letting kids climb trees or explore or use the stove, or ...use knives. The dangers of life seem so much in the forefront for the way our society now thinks. <br/>

Thank goodness we unschool!<br/>

<br/>
  Nowadays, even accidentally having a table knife means automatic <br/>
  expulsion from school. A kid at our neighborhood school had been <br/>
  helping his grandmother move and a table knife had fallen out of a <br/>
  box of his grandmother&#39;s stuff. He was expelled for having a knife on <br/>
  campus. There was a big hoopla over it, but his family lost because <br/>
  the school district had a zero tolerance rule.<br/>
