<div id="ygrps-yiv-1281374970">I&#39;ve heard people talk about Geoboards, where you make<br/>
different designs with rubber bands and pegs.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking of getting one, and was wondering if<br/>
there are any specific brands or places to get them<br/>
that are better than others.<br/>
<br/>
Also, any &quot;tips&quot; or specific ideas on using them?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We made our own using those shiny brass colored nails and a chunk of<br/>
wood.  It is about one foot square and we measured and drew lines<br/>
every inch. The boys took turns pounding in the nails.  I gave them a<br/>
pile of rubber bands and they use it like any other toy/game.  Right<br/>
now it is in the closet for them to access as they like.  We always<br/>
have lots of rubber bands to make rubber band balls - different colors<br/>
and sizes make it interesting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-960331438">We have three inexpensive blue plastic two-sided ones.  One side has a<br/>
round design in the pegs, and the other is a grid.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not so important what you get (though that round side is pretty<br/>
cool).  Get more than one kind, if you find another one later.<br/>
<br/>
Different colors and sizes of rubber bands is an important thing to<br/>
consider.<br/>

There&#39;s a very inexpensive two-sided one!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-954727105">here&#39;s a link to make one-its easy really.<br/>
<br/>
All it takes to make a geoboard is a small square piece of wood, 25 nails, and a hammer. Draw five equally spaced vertical lines and five equally spaced horizontal lines. Hammer a nail at each of the 25 intersection points and, you have a geoboard. <br/>
<br/>
To use it, however, you need one other item--rubber bands. <br/>
