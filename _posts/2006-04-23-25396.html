<div id="ygrps-yiv-725407759">We have always leaned toward unschooling, but over the past few years <br/>
I have become more...ummm...controling.  I want to get back to our <br/>
roots and toss the schedules for the rest of the year.  I&#39;m curious to <br/>
see how this will all work out with high schoolers and middle <br/>
schoolers.  My dh is not quite on the same page with me as this, he <br/>
never was which is probably why we&#39;ve gravitated toward planned <br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
So, I need suggestions about letting the kids loose while requesting <br/>
some accountability to appease my husband.  Would learning journals <br/>
work?  Ideas?</div>

out where grandparents and friends can look whenever they want to.<br/>

There are some linked here (bottom left, I think), and some of those  <br/>
might have an unschooling blogring link so you can look at others not  <br/>
listed there.<br/>

Those might give you ideas. They&#39;re not too difficult to set up.  You  <br/>
have teens who could help you.<br/>

My dh wasn&#39;t too sure about unschooling at first (about 9-10 years <br/>
ago), and was also adamant the kids be in bed and stay there at a <br/>
certain time.  I&#39;d just come home from a one-day conference -- probably <br/>
the first time I heard Sandra speak -- with an armload of interesting <br/>
toys and books and a head full of inspiration.  One of the books was <br/>
about finding Titanic, and included a paper model, which I decided <br/>
Mommy should put together (I really like that kind of thing :-)  I was <br/>
working on it after the kids had gone to bed, but then-7-y.o. Alex got <br/>
up.  He looked at the book and we talked about it as I worked; we <br/>
discovered what a fathom was, and that Titanic came to rest on the <br/>
continental shelf, not the very bottom of the ocean, and I&#39;m sure some <br/>
more interesting things, but those stick in my mind.  About a half hour <br/>
later, Alex went back to bed and I kept gluing.  Dh came in and said, <br/>
&quot;So that&#39;s unschooling.&quot;  He&#39;d overheard the conversation.  I said, <br/>
&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s unschooling.&quot;  Never had an argument after that :-)<br/>
