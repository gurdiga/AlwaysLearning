<br/>
Sandra Dodd goes on about it:<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t check to see if people have really thought about what  <br/>
they&#39;ve read.  We can&#39;t say &quot;Wait!  Don&#39;t change anything at your  <br/>
house until we&#39;re sure  you really know what you&#39;re doing!&quot;  There  <br/>
have been some dismal reports of what happened when the mom read her  <br/>
a while, turned around and said &quot;No more bedtimes!  No more chores!   <br/>
Eat TWINKIES!&quot;   And when her kids passed out midmorning on a pile of  <br/>
dirty laundry with ants eating twinkie-cream off their fingers, she  <br/>
seemed angry with some of us, because we&#39;d  written here and there  <br/>
that we didn&#39;t have bedtimes, didn&#39;t require chores, and our kids  <br/>
could eat what they wanted.<br/>
<br/>
Some years back there were two or three moms who were &quot;accusing&quot; me  <br/>
of telling people they couldn&#39;t unschool.  That would only work if I  <br/>
had the power to declare that a person COULD unschool.<br/>
<br/>
People come and tell us all the time that they can or can&#39;t  <br/>
unschool.  Sometimes they say &quot;I am unschooling but....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And they&#39;re unschooling because they say they are, or they think they  <br/>
are, but then they tell US they can&#39;t unschool by going into detail  <br/>
about how they can&#39;t trust their kids to learn to read or do math, or  <br/>
they are unschooling but their husband doesn&#39;t agree to it, but they  <br/>
are unschooling after school and on weekends, or they&#39;re unschooling  <br/>
in the summers, before school starts again, or they&#39;re unschooling  <br/>
but the kids need to do workbooks.<br/>
<br/>
That says clear as day &quot;I am not and cannot do what you&#39;re all  <br/>
talking about, but I want to go around chirping &#39;We&#39;re UNschoolers!&#39;  <br/>
regardless of the fact that I don&#39;t get and and am indicating as  <br/>
clear as day that I don&#39;t want to get it or don&#39;t really think  <br/>
there&#39;s anything TO get.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I say people like that can&#39;t unschool.  When I say that, I&#39;m just  <br/>
agreeing with them, basically.  They&#39;re in one huge exhale of chatter  <br/>
and justification and wall-of-sound, without any inhale expected.   <br/>
They can&#39;t take info in because they&#39;re blowing so much out.<br/>
<br/>
Some go the other way.  They say &quot;I can&#39;t unschool because my kids  <br/>
would never open a book, they would watch TV all day if I let them,  <br/>
they would never get out of bed, they would never learn to make  <br/>
change or wipe their own asses if they didn&#39;t go to school&quot;  Why  <br/>
people come and tell us things like that, I&#39;m not sure.  I think they  <br/>
want us to say &quot;That&#39;s okay.  Your kids will be just as happy as ours  <br/>
are.&quot;  They want some kind of absolution.<br/>
<br/>
They come to tell us they can&#39;t do what we do, but they want something.<br/>

<br/>
I was wondering if there could be a checklist to help people with  <br/>
&quot;careful thought.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe some of the items could be:<br/>
<br/>
What are the alternatives?<br/>
What might keep it from working at our house?<br/>
What confuses me about this idea?<br/>
What are my priorities?<br/>
How important is it?<br/>
Is this worth changing my life for?<br/>
<br/>
Questions like that could easily persuade people that unschooling  <br/>
isn&#39;t for them or their families, but without the option of deciding  <br/>
&quot;no,&quot; then there was no option at all.<br/>
<br/>
If people don&#39;t decide between two or more things, they didn&#39;t really  <br/>
make a decision.<br/>
