<div id="ygrps-yiv-359356353">I wrote this during the same days I posted &quot;sweet sixteen&quot;. I guess I got<br/>
a writing bug. <br/>
I thought I&#39;d post this so you don&#39;t think all isn&#39;t well between my son<br/>
and I, plus there was some talk about sex ed so I thought this kinda fit<br/>
with the topic. <br/>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
Yesterday my son asked if I could give him and hid friends a ride to<br/>
planned parenthood. I asked were it was, that if it was on my way to the<br/>
store, I&#39;d do it. Of course I also asked why they wanted to go there. He<br/>
said &quot;Wednesdays are free condom day&quot;. It was on the way, so I said I&#39;d<br/>
drop them off and they could walk over to meet me at the store when they<br/>
were done. On the ride over I asked what they wanted the condoms for 8 ),<br/>
that if they planned on using them, they should probably talk to their<br/>
parents about this stuff. My son said he knew I would cause a problem if<br/>
I went along. He was driving so it&#39;s not like I was taking them, he was,<br/>
I was just along for the ride cause he only has a driving permit. His<br/>
friend that already has a bun in someone&#39;s oven said he can&#39;t talk to his<br/>
parents about this stuff, they&#39;d just yell, drink and/or do more drugs if<br/>
he brings it up. Sad! : (  The girl that was with us kinda just laughed<br/>
it off. My son didn&#39;t want to hear a lecture but I said I have to do &quot;the<br/>
mom thing&quot;. I told them condoms weren&#39;t 100% guaranteed, I don&#39;t think<br/>
anything is and they really should talk to someone, a parent, doctor. I<br/>
asked if they give out condoms at school or if that was just something I<br/>
saw on TV. They said the school has an abstinence policy. I said well<br/>
that&#39;s probably 100% guaranteed except for that immaculate conception<br/>
thing going round. My son didn&#39;t know what I was talking about so I<br/>
filled him in on Mary from back in the day. The girl said someone came<br/>
into one of her classes and besides other things, talked about an 8 yr<br/>
old girl who immaculately conceived, the doctors said her hymen was never<br/>
broken but she was pregnant. I don&#39;t know. I&#39;ve never heard about it<br/>
before. I don&#39;t think I lectured them, and I don&#39;t think they felt as if<br/>
I were, we were just talking. I dropped them off, or should I say they<br/>
abandoned me in the parking lot but left me the keys, so I continued on<br/>
to the store. They took a backpack with them thinking they&#39;d load up on<br/>
condoms, I found this funny. They met up with me shortly after, at the<br/>
store, but with no condoms. The governor of our state cut funding so no<br/>
freebies. I guess he&#39;s pro life. <br/>
The last thing on my shopping list was calling cards. I like the kids to<br/>
carry them if they need to make a call while they&#39;re out. They&#39;d prefer<br/>
cell phones but we tried that route and it&#39;s not in our budget. That&#39;s a<br/>
whole other story. My son grabbed a pack and pointed out that some charge<br/>
9 mins. while others charge 12 mins. automatically when you use them at a<br/>
pay phone. The packaging for both kinds looked identical, from the same<br/>
company. The small print. It&#39;s amazing to me that he&#39;d pick that up in<br/>
the small print. I wouldn&#39;t have noticed. A gentleman was looking at the<br/>
rack of cards. Being the good citizen I try to be, I pointed out to him<br/>
what my son just showed me. I said &quot;my son is so smart&quot;, I&#39;m a proud<br/>
mama! The gentleman agreed that it wasn&#39;t a noticeable difference in<br/>
packaging. At the same time a woman must have overheard half our<br/>
conversation, grabbed a pack of cards also, and said it&#39;s just 25 cents,<br/>
what&#39;s the big deal, it&#39;s still cheaper than using the pay phone with<br/>
change, and she proceeded to the register. She missed the point, sounded<br/>
defensive, and I didn&#39;t want to start an argument so I just smiled, so<br/>
did the gentleman. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve got a whole rant about cards but I&#39;ll save it for later.<br/>
