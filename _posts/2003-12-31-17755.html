<div id="ygrps-yiv-95716084">Our family does believe that refined sugar is very<br/>
harmful, mainly because it is a highly refined<br/>
chemical and not recognizable as a &quot;food&quot; because of<br/>
what has been done to it.  Most people do eat WAAAAAY<br/>
too much of it, and it is causing health problems,<br/>
even if the article in question was alarmist and<br/>
extreme.  In general, the more processing foods have,<br/>
the worse they are for your body.  <br/>
<br/>
But all the doom and gloom in the article talks about<br/>
corn syrup, refined sugars, fast food and &quot;typical<br/>
American diets.&quot;  These are not unavoidable horrors. <br/>
You can live in America, live a &quot;normal&quot; life, and<br/>
still avoid these things.  <br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t eat fast food at all, partly due to it&#39;s<br/>
horrendous quality that none of us feel is worth our<br/>
money, partly because we have so many excellent<br/>
favorite restaurants locally, which serve delicious<br/>
and healthy foods, and partly because myself and one<br/>
of our sons have food allergies to preservatives which<br/>
makes eating fast food a very uncomfortable<br/>
experience.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t drink sodas very often, maybe a couple of<br/>
times a month, as we just don&#39;t like them much.  We<br/>
use unrefined sugar for cooking, baking and table<br/>
sugar, which tastes identical to the bleached stuff. <br/>
We also use honey for cooking, baking and sweetening<br/>
drinks, and occassionally molasses or organic whole<br/>
maple syrup.  All of these sweeteners are not hard to<br/>
come by, are infinately better for us, and taste a lot<br/>
better too.  <br/>
<br/>
We also don&#39;t buy a lot of pre-cooked, processed foods<br/>
for several reasons.  Again, we have preservative<br/>
allergies which makes avoiding them a no brainer.  I&#39;m<br/>
a pretty good cook, and the pre-made stuff just is<br/>
disappointing when I think about what I could have<br/>
made with similar basic ingredients.  When we are<br/>
shopping, we look for food options without corn syrup<br/>
or added sugars.  With all the food allergies in our<br/>
family, we&#39;re definately label readers.<br/>
<br/>
All this doesn&#39;t mean we are food nazi&#39;s, or that the<br/>
kids never get candy, or we never enjoy a burger.  We<br/>
just try to make choices from the less toxic options. <br/>
Even the kids prefer the organic honey caramels to the<br/>
refined ones, or the granola with fruit to the sugary<br/>
cereals, or real juice to sugary punch drinks.  They<br/>
just taste better, and they feel better to eat.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Our family does believe that refined sugar is very<br/>
&gt; harmful, mainly because it is a highly refined<br/>
&gt; chemical and not recognizable as a &quot;food&quot; because of<br/>
&gt; what has been done to it.  Most people do eat WAAAAAY<br/>
&gt; too much of it, and it is causing health problems,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Riding in cars can kill me.<br/>
So can riding a horse.<br/>
So can keeping a 2 pound rabbit as a pet (death from infected rabbit bite).<br/>
So can eating organic food if I choke on it.<br/>
So can owning a computer if I am cleaning behind it and trip over the power<br/>
cord and electrocute myself.<br/>
So can breathing, because natural OR man-made pollutants can kill me dead.<br/>
<br/>
And something is bound to kill me sometime anyway, no matter how well I read<br/>
the articles and do every single thing they say, to the letter.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t need articles that use at least a decent percentage of junk science<br/>
and scare tactics to tell me what I must do Or Else. Surprisingly, in this<br/>
world of extreme media, most of us have heard rumors that sugar is not the<br/>
healthiest choice for us. Heck, I heard it as a child BEFORE extreme media<br/>
came upon us.<br/>
<br/>
I have choices and don&#39;t need anybody to scare me or shame me into making<br/>
them the direction they&#39;d like me to go. I have the choice to do the things<br/>
that I enjoy (some seal-of-approval &quot;healthy&quot; and some frowny-faced<br/>
&quot;unhealthy&quot;) and take my chances, or I can try to force myself and my family<br/>
towards what we don&#39;t enjoy in the name of possible better health and<br/>
possible lesser risks. Refined sugar isn&#39;t an immediate cause of death and<br/>
poor health for many people, nor is it an inevitable one for many people.<br/>
<br/>
Those who don&#39;t care for refined sugar and preservatives should definitely<br/>
exercise their free will and not eat them. Those who do should not be<br/>
lectured on how we eat too much of it, it causes health problems, and told<br/>
the natural stuff tastes way better. I faithfully promise not to badger<br/>
anyone to eat my homemade chocolate chip cookies, made with white AND brown<br/>
sugar, if I can just be allowed to decide for myself what tastes good to me<br/>
and how my body does or does not react to it.<br/>
<br/>
I think healthy eating causes all sorts of unpleasant things, including the<br/>
&quot;do it my way or you and everyone you love is DOOMED DOOMED DOOOOOMED!&quot;<br/>
article copied to this list.<br/>
<br/>
Live. Let live (even if you don&#39;t agree with how the other person&#39;s living).<br/>
Don&#39;t worry. Be happy.<br/>

Marty was shaving his face (and blaming me, just because I had said I thought <br/>
his beard was cute) and then he dropped his electric razor in the toilet.  <br/>
(It&#39;s cordless, but it was still exciting.)<br/>

Well on a sugar-free-diet list, go to down about doom.<br/>
<br/>
On an unschooling list, don&#39;t let people live a restrictive mean-mom <br/>
schoolish life without commenting, at least, on potential doom.<br/>

I recently gave myself a shock while plugging in the electric mixer.  I accidently had my fingers touching the metal part.  It was weird.  I felt the shock go right up my arm to my chest.<br/>
<br/>
Guess I better ban electric mixers from my house &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1993799032"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Riding in cars can kill me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So we wear seat belts and drive defensively, a<br/>
reasonable level of precaution.  The same applies to<br/>
all the other examples you gave.  Of course, a person<br/>
can kill themselves taking a bath, or doing any number<br/>
of innoccuous other things.  It follows that we take<br/>
reasonable precautions to these dangers (like non-slip<br/>
bath mats.)<br/>
<br/>
There was no need to be defensive.  I was simply<br/>
saying that there is a more reasonable approach to<br/>
avoiding these things if one wishes it, rather than<br/>
the histrionics in the article.  I was rebutting the<br/>
article&#39;s (which I did not post) doom and gloom and<br/>
sensationalism with a little common sense.  I<br/>
certainly was not trying to lecture to anyone and I<br/>
certainly was not suggesting anyone follow that<br/>
article to the letter, as I was in disagreement with<br/>
it&#39;s method, and a lot of it&#39;s content.  I don&#39;t<br/>
generally follow any propaganda, nor do I believe<br/>
everything I read.  <br/>
<br/>
Obviously (by my firm belief in an unschooling<br/>
lifestyle) I am a believer in free choice.  I respect<br/>
the choices of my children and of other people.  I<br/>
don&#39;t tell people what to eat or how to live.  I was<br/>
merely saying that a more reasonable approach (than<br/>
that of the article) was certainly possible, and<br/>
explaining how we do it.  I was trying to point out<br/>
that this does not have to be an all or nothing issue.<br/>
 There does not have to be a defensive division that<br/>
always seems to arise over this issue.  <br/>
<br/>
When I said some things tasted better, I meant of<br/>
course to US.  I cannot say what tastes better in<br/>
anyone else&#39;s mouth.  We feel that they taste better. <br/>
I do believe that many people eat way too much sugar,<br/>
and that probably includes my family, particularly<br/>
this time of year.  It was not a statement to shame or<br/>
badger anyone in any way.  We refuse to &quot;do guilt&quot; in<br/>
this house.  It&#39;s just good to recognize excess, even<br/>
if you in no way want to reduce it, in my opinion.  <br/>
<br/>
I was merely presenting a more reasonable approach to<br/>
a desire to avoid processed sugars, something we<br/>
attempt.<br/>

miscommunication.  I have been on this list for so long that I forget <br/>
that no one really knows me in person, except Mary Ellen and maybe <br/>
one or two others, if they are still around.  It&#39;s definately in <br/>
character for me to make impassioned statements of my beliefs, or <br/>
ehthusiastically share our dreams with people.  It&#39;s definately OUT <br/>
of character for me to be dishonest in any way.  That includes going <br/>
around and delivering Universal Truth Proclamations, as I don&#39;t <br/>
believe there to be any such thing as universal truths, and to claim <br/>
to have them is a lie, even if you yourself believe it,  as you would <br/>
be buying your own bullshit.<br/>

It&#39;s a good reminder for me to always approach every email as if <br/>
