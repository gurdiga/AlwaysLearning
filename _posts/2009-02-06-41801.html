<div id="ygrps-yiv-225744582">The topic of kids and alcohol occasionally and I thought this blog  <br/>
entry from the New York Times was interesting in that he observed the  <br/>
differences between kids who&#39;d been controlled and his parent&#39;s  <br/>
moderate approach.<br/>
<br/>
Near the beginning is the quote from G.K. Chesterton: “The  <br/>
dipsomaniac and the abstainer are not only both mistaken, but they  <br/>
both make the same mistake. They both regard wine as a drug and not  <br/>
as a drink.”<br/>
<br/>
My parents did the same as the author&#39;s parents with my sister and  <br/>
me. I tasted mixed drinks, had a bit of brandy on frigid days after  <br/>
skiing (and I was never dawn to it any other time), had some -- very  <br/>
strong! -- mixed drinks (most of which I didn&#39;t finish ;-) and wine  <br/>
my aunt would serve us with Sunday dinner. Both my sister and I have  <br/>
healthy relationships with alcohol. I did the same with Kathryn,  <br/>
though she&#39;s seen less since we don&#39;t drink much. Occasionally a  <br/>
bottle of wine wanders in and she has half a glass.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a piece from the blog:<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; During my formative-drinking years, when alcohol was still a  <br/>
&gt; relative novelty, I had something that many of my harder-drinking  <br/>
&gt; friends did not: parents who demonstrated a responsible  <br/>
&gt; relationship with alcohol. My father and sometimes my mother would  <br/>
&gt; crack a cold beer on hot days, and wine was regularly served at  <br/>
&gt; dinner on weekends and special occasions to everyone including the  <br/>
&gt; kids. They kept a decently stocked liquor cabinet, but usually only  <br/>
&gt; opened it for drop-by guests and the occasional dinner party, which  <br/>
&gt; were celebrated in good cheer but were seldom if ever followed by  <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; This open yet modest approach to alcohol was in contrast to the  <br/>
&gt; paths taken by the families of some friends and neighbors, whose  <br/>
&gt; habits ranged from over-indulgent to abstemious and were sometimes  <br/>
&gt; an odd mix of the two: it was not lost on me during my secular  <br/>
&gt; Bible Belt upbringing that some of my hardest-drinking friends –  <br/>
&gt; whose relationships with booze were often of the vomit-in-the- <br/>
&gt; shrubbery, loss-of-all-personal-control variety – were from  <br/>
&gt; religious homes in which alcohol was seldom if ever served.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Knowing that my 6-year-old daughter and 8-year-old son will likely  <br/>
&gt; start to experiment with alcohol in – let’s be realistic – about a  <br/>
&gt; decade, give or take, I fully realize that every time my wife or I  <br/>
&gt; take a drink around them, a message is being sent. There are  <br/>
&gt; several directions this can go, and I understand I’ll never have  <br/>
&gt; total control over any of them. If completely banishing alcohol  <br/>
&gt; from our home would protect them from any of its hazards later in  <br/>
&gt; life, it’d be an easy choice, but as my old hard-drinking friends  <br/>
&gt; demonstrated, that’s just a bit too simple and naïve to be a  <br/>
&gt; realistic option.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Instead, I try to mirror the moderate approach taken by my own  <br/>
&gt; parents, leavening this with the lessons I learned from these hard- <br/>
&gt; drinking friends who had more rigid upbringings, along with those I  <br/>
&gt; pick up from watching the unique slice of life visible in Las Vegas  <br/>
&gt; and New Orleans: when it comes to alcohol, an extreme approach at  <br/>
&gt; either end of the spectrum can be bad news. Too much is always too  <br/>
&gt; much, and none at all can also be too much; but tacking an even  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1345895881">I&#39;m glad this topic came up.  I&#39;ve wondered about it for a long time.   <br/>
If it were just me, I would allow either of my kids to have an  <br/>
occasional drink with dinner, or with company or  just with family.  <br/>
However, I don&#39;t keep alcohol in the house due to my husband&#39;s  <br/>
tendency to &quot;drink it if it&#39;s there.&quot;  I enjoy the occasional  <br/>
alcoholic drink but I abstain at home except for when my husband is  <br/>
out of town or when we&#39;re entertaining -- neither of which happens  <br/>
very often.  I feel like I&#39;m walking on a double-edged sword regarding  <br/>
alcohol and my kids -- I want them to have exposure to it and others  <br/>
drinking responsibly, but their father can&#39;t be trusted to drink  <br/>
responsibly.  Which is worse - no exposure or a role model of poor  <br/>
judgment?<br/>

<br/>
I think that&#39;s true of just about anything.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easy for people without any genetic alcoholism to think  <br/>
moderation will do it for life.  I think a casual attitude toward lots  <br/>
of things (religion, sex, marijuana) can prevent the wind-it-up, wind- <br/>
it-up, LAUNCH IT effect of parents telling kids no, no, not until  <br/>
you&#39;re grown/married/older, or no, no, not until I&#39;m dead.<br/>
<br/>
Yet because of my mother&#39;s family and my friend Jon Tsosie&#39;s family on  <br/>
both sideas (and others, but those two have been my longitudinal  <br/>
observations--not only during my lifetime, but family stories in both  <br/>
families, and observation of the teens in both families who were young  <br/>
enough to be my own kids, and lately grandkids....) it does seem there  <br/>
are genetic problems.  And whether it involves impulse control or some  <br/>
sort of bodily &quot;allergy&quot; or propensity to want to replace internal  <br/>
fluids with alcohol, or maybe it takes the combination of both, it  <br/>
doesn&#39;t seem that modelling (for drinking or against it) or moderation  <br/>
prevents the problem in those in whom it kicks in.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t prohibit my kids alcohol.  Keith and I hardly ever drink any.   <br/>
We drank at Marty&#39;s birthday party, and Marty&#39;s not even 21, but most  <br/>
of his friends are, and it was at our house and we provided sleep-over  <br/>
facilities for anyone who needed it.  Many of those who came over  <br/>
didn&#39;t drink at all.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I decided when Kirby was a baby was that they weren&#39;t going  <br/>
to suffer the direct damage that alcoholic relatives inflict, and so  <br/>
there are relatives of mine who aren&#39;t welcome to my house for more  <br/>
than a couple of hours--no weekend stays.  It&#39;s not stated, but  <br/>
they&#39;re not invited and I don&#39;t offer them beer if they&#39;re over, which  <br/>
is sometimes in itself what gets them easily gone within a couple of  <br/>
hours. Because my kids don&#39;t know and love them, the acoholism (and  <br/>
related accidents and arrests and job loss and relationship  <br/>
destruction) don&#39;t bother them as much.  I hear about it, but one  <br/>
thing I&#39;m glad I learned when I went to adult children of alcoholics  <br/>
meetings in my 30&#39;s is detachment.  I&#39;m able to see that my nephew&#39;s  <br/>
life, my half-brother&#39;s life, my cousin&#39;s life, are not MY life.<br/>
<br/>
I would love to find out the whole genetics model is something else  <br/>
only obliquely &quot;causing&quot; alcoholism in individuals, but seeing kids  <br/>
whose grandparents and great grandparents I knew (or knew from photos  <br/>
and stories and knew the details of their sometimes alcohol-related  <br/>
deaths)...  it&#39;s hard for me not to be very glad for my own kids that  <br/>
they only have one alcoholic grandparent of four.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easy for people without any genetic alcoholism to think  <br/>
moderation will do it for life.  Does their &quot;proof&quot; in their own  <br/>
family parallel my proof that kids can learn to read without lessons?   <br/>
I don&#39;t think so, but somewhere in the model or the language could be  <br/>
a place where I could better clarify what I think and say, so I hope  <br/>
someone here can untangle it for me.  Someone else&#39;s alcoholism kicked  <br/>
my life&#39;s butt, and although I&#39;ve worked to consciously move from and  <br/>
change the effects of that in my own kids&#39; lives, sometimes it&#39;s still  <br/>
hard for me to look at those things without the emotions of a scared  <br/>
little kid.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think I have alcoholism in my blood. I was raised with a semi-loose<br/>
attitude.  My parents let me sample their martinis or margaritas and<br/>
my mom would let me have a small glass of wine when Daddy was out of<br/>
town with her at dinner, which I could rarely finish before the age of<br/>
10.  But my dad had pancreatitis when I was about 13 or so and it was<br/>
attributed to excessive alcohol so he stopped drinking.  We still had<br/>
it in the house and my mom drank occasionally.  I was stealing liquor<br/>
from them by 14.  Who knows why?  There was no real taboo for me<br/>
surrounding it, no mystery.  I was bored and wanted to alter my<br/>
consciousness.<br/>
<br/>
I went through some hard times as a young 20 something drinking into<br/>
black outs (who didn&#39;t I guess right!).  I am now able to enjoy the<br/>
occasional beer or glass of wine but sometimes I drink them under<br/>
times of stress.  I do not want my kids to see that as an option.  My<br/>
own journey of course.  But I do think wine or beer with food or in<br/>
celebration is fun and OK.  Am I in denial?  Maybe.<br/>
<br/>
But I do want them to feel free to enjoy alcohol if it is within their<br/>
capacity.  Should I be open about the blood lines we have that contain<br/>
alcoholism and drug addiction and warn them?  Do I try to demonstrate<br/>
for them other ways to alter consciousness like meditation?  <br/>
<br/>
I fully buy into the idea that alcoholism and addiction can be<br/>
hereditary and seriously considered not having children because of it.<br/>
 Now that I have some and love parenting and want more and all that, I<br/>
do wonder what the best course of action when it comes to alcohol<br/>
consumption should be.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1708922486">His parents sound exactly like my parents and all 4 of us have a really healthy relationship with alcohol.<br/>
Me and my sister rarely drink and my brother has a cold one here and there and with friends.<br/>
We had a stocked bar and my parents only had some drinks when friends where over or special occasions.<br/>
We very often had a little red wine glass for lunch on Sundays .<br/>
My grandparents gave us Port Wine and things like Amaretto.<br/>
I remember been tipsy one time early on . So my parents just guided me towards eating a little and drinking water.<br/>
So most of the time I ever felt that way that is what I did in my adult life. <br/>
I also never saw my parents drunk. My mom I saw her a little happy a few times after one glass of wine.<br/>
She was very sensitive to alcohol and we used to say she got drunk on coke. She rarely really drank any even if dad was having a beer.<br/>
My parents talked about it openly about how and why people got drunk and how you could die from it or do stupid things but they talked about it not in a judgmental way. They had drinks for pleasure and not to escape or get drunk and wasted.<br/>
We all got  a little drunk one time or another but not with the intention of getting wasted like the young people here in the US.<br/>
I remember getting drunk for not eating and sipping off my boyfriend&#39;s drink. He took me home and put me in bed.<br/>
I used to fly with a French pilot and we once had the same discussion of how in France they give their kids alcohol like in Brazil.<br/>
That it is not a prohibited thing and the youth does not go out to get drunk  like the youth here.<br/>

<br/>
They&#39;re a little young to warn them now. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve told my kids from time to time to remember to be careful.  I said  <br/>
people aren&#39;t sure what causes it but it&#39;s possible they&#39;ll be  <br/>
drinking with friends who are in no danger of alcoholism but that  <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean everyone in the group will be that way, and so to be  <br/>
aware and not to ruin their lives or other people&#39;s lives.  Not all  <br/>
that at once, but over the course of years, casual mentions here and  <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
That wouldn&#39;t hurt in any case, if it&#39;s something that can come  <br/>
naturally in your family.<br/>
Kirby was ten when I had a meditation session with him and showed him  <br/>
how he could really still his mind and slow his heart, right in his  <br/>
own home.  I remember him being really quiet and into it for quite a  <br/>
long time, and Marty playing around quietly in and out of where we  <br/>
were, and Holly being asleep in the next room.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1559908882">This is long, I know.. but, it&#39;s a topic that I wrestle with.. it&#39;s<br/>
one of those things that I just really don&#39;t know how I will deal with<br/>
it. But, it is an extremely important thing to address, with my boys,<br/>
I believe.<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I do not drink any alcohol. My mother was a closet<br/>
drunk and actually she died from her alcoholism in october of 2006. I<br/>
did not know she was an alcoholic until I was 19-20 yrs old (that&#39;s<br/>
just 6 years before she died). My father drank in front of us.. he was<br/>
very open with his alcohol consumption, which, in my opinion as an<br/>
adult, was bordering and sometimes overstepping what I would consider<br/>
an appropriate amount of alcohol for a parent to drink while being the<br/>
sole adult responsible for a group of children. As a kid, he was just<br/>
very funny and cool. LOL<br/>
<br/>
I grew up and never drank alcohol.. never even tried alcohol until I<br/>
was probably 23 or 24 years old. I wasn&#39;t scared of getting in<br/>
trouble... I didn&#39;t really grasp alcoholism or the fact that my<br/>
parents were both heavy drinkers. I just wasn&#39;t interested. I drank<br/>
responsibly for a couple of years, as an adult,  and I got drunk maybe<br/>
two or three times, in those years and it was kind of fun, but I<br/>
thought, not as fun as if I had been sober.. alcohol never really did<br/>
anything for me, it was a lot more expensive than soda or water.. so,<br/>
I never really understood the appeal. It just didn&#39;t seem to have any<br/>
affect unless I drank a ton of it and got smashed. Which was stupid,<br/>
to me. <br/>
<br/>
My brother is an alcoholic. A real alcoholic who drinks a lot and has<br/>
a lot of trouble with the law because of drinking.. and cannot grasp<br/>
that, at this point, he is unable to control how much alcohol he<br/>
drinks. It&#39;s sad really and it sucks. I worry about him a lot. <br/>
<br/>
My husband is an alcoholic who has been fighting with alcoholism since<br/>
he was like daggone 10. He&#39;s been sober for a bit over 2 years. His<br/>
father was very non-chalant about alcohol and frequently gave him a<br/>
beer or two on fishing trips and such. His maternal grandfather was an<br/>
alcoholic. As an adult, he has no control over how much alcohol he<br/>
drinks.  At first, it seems like he can say.. just one beer. But, it<br/>
will slowly progress into downing a pint of vodka in just a couple<br/>
swallows. It&#39;s scary, it&#39;s nerve wracking... there&#39;s been times when I<br/>
thought he was probably going to die.<br/>
<br/>
Looking back at my family, there is not a generation that has not been<br/>
affected by alcoholism. My great grandpa was.. my meemaw & my<br/>
grandfather had to completely stop drinking because of alcoholism..<br/>
all of their children are alcoholics - two of them have died from<br/>
it... and all of my cousins are alcoholics,... I seem to be the only<br/>
one who is unaffected by this. I am also the only one who chose not to<br/>
drink alcohol under age. Maybe there is a correlation, maybe not. <br/>
<br/>
But, I hope alcohol is something my boys just won&#39;t be drawn towards.<br/>
It is something I cannot model for them. I could probably drink<br/>
alcohol just fine (that&#39;s really just a guess that I wouldn&#39;t want to<br/>
push too far)... but, out of respect for my husband, I do not.. out of<br/>
remembering what it did to my mom, I just don&#39;t do it. To me it is not<br/>
just a drink... I&#39;ve watched it destroy people&#39;s bodies, and destroy<br/>
lives, and tear families apart... I know, in excessive amounts.. but,<br/>
the threat is there - they all started by drinking in moderation. If<br/>
alcoholism is genetic, the threat is very real to my children. If it&#39;s<br/>
passed down, somehow, in genes, there is a high probability that if my<br/>
sons drink.. it will be their destruction, regardless of what I have<br/>
said to them or modeled for them. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t intend to just say, &quot;Alcohol is bad. Blahh.&quot; But, I will be<br/>
very adamant about the necessity for caution in their experience. <br/>
It&#39;s scary to think about. I have a good amount of time before the<br/>
boys will even come into contact with alcohol.. but, just the other<br/>
day, I had to explain why alcohol is different than a regular drink<br/>
when my son was worried about drinking his juice in the car.. he had<br/>
seen those drunk driving commercials and didn&#39;t understand why police<br/>
were pulling people over for drinking.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-449761733">I went looking up the genetic links with alcoholism. Twin studies put the genetic influence at a range of 50%-60% of alcoholism. Which means that environment plays a role of 40%-50%. The genetics are all tangled, it is not a single locus, it&#39;s a number of different things. And how they react with each other probably has a lot to do with the environment within which those genes play out. <br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t straightforward. Being the child of alcoholics isn&#39;t going to make you an alcoholic, but being both their child and raised in an actively alcoholic home might do it. And you might be the grandchild of an alcoholic with alcoholism not expressed in your natal home and have enough stress or neglect or whatever it is that flips that trigger so that the genes line up and express the alcoholism in a way that wouldn&#39;t have played out in a different home. Having the genes required for alcoholism doesn&#39;t predetermine alcoholism, it just tips the scale.<br/>
<br/>
You can be an alcoholic without the genetics, or so I assume (with discussions with David going on while I write this). Conversely, or so it would seem to me, you can be an alcoholic without the environment. Although Rat Park would argue against that. And I really like Rat Park. So, maybe you can&#39;t be an alcoholic without the right environment. Maybe addiction is a reaction to the environment as opposed to a disease that strikes unavoidably? I like that story the best. I think that&#39;s the one I&#39;ll tell. <br/>
<br/>
Oh, I couldn&#39;t quite let go and send this. I found a look at the genetics of alcoholism and the studies that talk about where the pre-disposition may lie: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a><br/>
/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=103780 I&#39;ll quote the introduction, which I found most interesting:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The tendency for drinking patterns of children to resemble those of<br/>
their parents has been recognized since antiquity, e.g., in the<br/>
observations of Plato and Aristotle (Warner and Rosett, 1975). Alcoholism is probably a multifactorial, genetically influenced disorder (Goodwin, 1976).<br/>
The genetic influence is indicated by studies showing that (1) there is<br/>
a 25 to 50% lifetime risk for alcoholism in sons and brothers of<br/>
severely alcoholic men; (2) alcohol preference can be selectively bred<br/>
for in experimental animals; (3) there is a 55% or higher concordance<br/>
rate in monozygotic twins with only a 28% rate for like-sex dizygotic<br/>
twins; and (4) half brothers with different fathers and adopted sons of<br/>
alcoholic men show a rate of alcoholism more like that of the biologic<br/>
father than that of the foster father. A possible biochemical basis is<br/>
a metabolic difference such that those prone to alcoholism have higher<br/>
levels of a metabolite giving pleasurable effects or those not prone to<br/>
alcoholism have higher levels of a metabolite giving unpleasant<br/>
effects. Schuckit and Rayses (1979) found that, after a moderate dose of alcohol, blood acetaldehyde levels<br/>
were elevated more in young men with alcoholic parents or sibs than in<br/>
controls. A certain degree of organ specificity in the pathologic<br/>
effects of alcohol is observed. For example, patients have<br/>
cardiomyopathy, cirrhosis, or pancreatitis but rarely more than one of<br/>
these. A genetic basis of organ specificity is evident in<br/>
Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (277730) and pancreatitis from type V hyperlipidemia (238400). Cloninger (1987) identified 2 separate heritable types of alcoholism. Type 1 alcohol<br/>
abuse had its usual onset after the age of 25 years and was<br/>
characterized by severe psychological dependence and guilt. It occurred<br/>
in both men and women and required both genetic and environmental<br/>
factors to become manifest. By contrast, type 2 alcohol abuse had its<br/>
onset before the age of 25; persons with this type of alcoholism were<br/>
characterized by their inability to abstain from alcohol and by<br/>
frequent aggressive and antisocial behavior. Type 2 alcoholism was<br/>
rarely found in women and was much more heritable. Abnormalities in<br/>
platelet monoamine oxidase activity were found only in type 2<br/>
alcoholics (Von Knorring et al., 1985). See comments by Omenn (1988).<br/>
<br/>
That leads me to this: <br/>
<br/>
Psychopathology in adopted-out children of alcoholics. The Stockholm Adoption Study.<br/>
Cloninger CR, Bohman M, Sigvardsson S, von Knorring AL.<br/>
The<br/>
inheritance of alcohol abuse and other psychopathology was studied in<br/>
862 men and 913 women adopted by nonrelatives at an early age in<br/>
Sweden. Both male and female adoptees had a greater risk of alcohol<br/>
abuse if their biologic, but not adoptive, parents were alcoholic. We<br/>
distinguished two types of alcoholism that have distinct genetic and<br/>
environmental causes and that differ in frequency of alcohol abuse and<br/>
somatoform disorders in women. The combination of both genetic and<br/>
environmental risk factors is required for development of alcoholism in<br/>
the most common type. In contrast, in families with the less common<br/>
type of susceptibility, alcohol abuse is highly heritable in the men,<br/>
but the women have multiple somatic complaints without alcohol abuse.<br/>
The implications of these findings of genetic heterogeneity and<br/>
gene-environment interaction are discussed in relation to research,<br/>
prevention, and treatment.<br/>
Oh, now I&#39;m all distracted. Maybe it answers some questions? <br/>

<br/>
I thought of mentioning that this morning but figured adoption flips  <br/>
too many people&#39;s switches.  I&#39;ve seen alcoholic adoptees in not-at- <br/>
all alcoholic families, and I&#39;ve seen mean thieves in families of  <br/>
honest peaceful people.   (Sorry to those who hate to think about any  <br/>
negatives related to adoption, but there it is.   I&#39;ve seen it and I&#39;m  <br/>
unwilling to withhold information to comfort people who are used to  <br/>
&quot;la la la.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
  I know a very musical adopted son of tone-deaf parents.  All they  <br/>
knew of his birthparents is they were both musicians.  He became a  <br/>
professional musician.  They encouraged him and provided instruments  <br/>
and opportunities, but he didn&#39;t get it from them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-454060620">Very interesting topic.  I&#39;ve enjoyed reading this.  Not sure if this<br/>
contributes in the proper way this group functions (I&#39;m still new) but for<br/>
what it&#39;s worth, me and my husband are both alcoholic, sober 20 & 30 years,<br/>
respectively.  My mothers dad was an alcoholic and what little she has<br/>
shared it was pretty abusive and hurtful to all.  So her experience, I<br/>
believe, caused her to have very strong opinions about drinking.  She once<br/>
asked me if I ever wanted to drink or smoke. I knew if I answered honestly<br/>
she&#39;d give me &quot;a good talkin&#39; to&quot;, so I lied.  I often wonder if they would<br/>
have been more open about things if I would have made different choices.  Or<br/>
did I ever have a choice?  hmmm, who knows.<br/>
<br/>
My husband is adopted and was raised in a very good, relatively normal,<br/>
home.  And he was sent to treatment for alcohol and drugs at age 17.  We<br/>
don&#39;t know anything about his birth parents.<br/>
<br/>
I always knew, at least since I was sober, that I would be open and honest<br/>
with my kids.  My parents hid so much from me, I &quot;launched&quot; into several<br/>
activities that I wonder if a little reality may have prevented.  I have<br/>
shared with my kids about my alcoholism (only a little b/c they are still<br/>
young).  I don&#39;t think alcohol is the devil and so don&#39;t talk with them<br/>
about it that way.  i do tell them that if and when they do drink to just be<br/>
aware that &quot;if&#39; it is genetic, they got a double dose.<br/>
<br/>
This summer we were having dinner with friends who were drinking beer.<br/>
I encouraged my kids to taste it if they wanted.  My oldest (10) wouldn&#39;t<br/>
(I hope I haven&#39;t freaked him out about it).  My middle one (8) was very<br/>
curious to taste it (she didn&#39;t like it) and my youngest (6) only smelled it<br/>
(he said &quot;smells like bread&quot;...lol).<br/>
<br/>
I may comment more later, but I&#39;m getting a migraine and this white screen<br/>
is not helping.<br/>

Did you follow up on that?  There&#39;s a reason beer smells like bread.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;There was probably a close connection between the production of beer and bread, the <br/>
domestication of barley, and the social and ceremonial importance of the alcohol in beer. <br/>
Beer was produced from bread, and barley is a very suitable cereal for both bread and <br/>
beer production. Additionally, alcohol has been emphasized to have an important role in <br/>
social relationship, in matters of reciprocity and obligation. The archaeologists Solomon <br/>
Katz and Mary Voight have proposed that the development of settled agriculture was <br/>
dependent on the desire to brew beer.&quot;<br/>

Although<br/>
a reduced liver size in elderly people has long been recognized from<br/>
post-mortem studies, these studies do not allow the separation of true<br/>
‘age-related’ differences from the effects of premorbid illness, and<br/>
death. An age-related effect was confirmed however by an in vivo study<br/>
which measured liver size by ultrasound scanning of healthy<br/>
individuals. This demonstrated a significant negative correlation<br/>
between age and liver volume, with volumes being 28% lower in<br/>
individuals above the age of 65 compared with those under 40 years of<br/>
age. <br/>

&gt; I hope this comes through, but here&#39;s an abstract that mentions age and<br/>
&gt; liver volume:<br/>

&gt; Although<br/>
&gt; a reduced liver size in elderly people has long been recognized from<br/>
&gt; post-mortem studies, these studies do not allow the separation of true<br/>
&gt; &#39;age-related&#39; differences from the effects of premorbid illness, and<br/>
&gt; death. An age-related effect was confirmed however by an in vivo study<br/>
&gt; which measured liver size by ultrasound scanning of healthy<br/>
&gt; individuals. This demonstrated a significant negative correlation<br/>
&gt; between age and liver volume, with volumes being 28% lower in<br/>
&gt; individuals above the age of 65 compared with those under 40 years of<br/>
&gt; age.<br/>

&gt; My understanding is that our livers get less efficient as we age, making it<br/>
&gt; harder for our<br/>
&gt; bodies to process the toxins in alcohol. I know I certainly can&#39;t handle it<br/>
&gt; like I used to!!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We both couldn&#39;t finish two beers if we wanted too. Does something<br/>
&gt; happen to your<br/>
&gt; body when you get older? &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I think something does happen as we age that makes drinking as much as<br/>
&gt; &gt; we once could harder.<br/>
