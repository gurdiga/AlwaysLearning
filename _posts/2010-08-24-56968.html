<br/>
My son did that quite a bit when he first began to write letters and numbers. Even now, at 12, when he&#39;s handwriting certain letters or numbers, he will write them backwards sometimes (not all the time). I don&#39;t worry about it because he reads and recognizes numbers just fine, and when he types things he knows exactly what those keys look like on the keyboard. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
===I guess my bottom line question is what do you do when there is something in the way of your child learning something (that they themselves want to know)?===<br/>
<br/>
What is he wanting to know and what&#39;s in the way of him knowing it?<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s wanting to write his name and he&#39;s happy with what he&#39;s doing, let it go. If, at some point, he recognizes that the way he&#39;s writing it doesn&#39;t look quite right and he asks for your help, you can print it with the letters facing the correct way and he can use that as a guide. But I wouldn&#39;t push that.<br/>

<br/>
It is normal, and if you start suspecting or looking for &quot;conditions&quot;  <br/>
to go with what he already has been labelled, your unschooling will  <br/>
slip away.<br/>
<br/>
-=-what do you do when there is something in the way of your child  <br/>
learning something (that they themselves want to know)?<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
Stop thinking of it that way.  If there is something they cannot  <br/>
learn, then they&#39;re not ready yet.  Pulling a plant out of the ground  <br/>
to look at its roots does NOT help the plant grow.<br/>
  There are millions of things you could do, see, taste, touch, listen  <br/>
to, see, talk about that don&#39;t require writing left to right.  If he  <br/>
doesn&#39;t read or write for many years, so what?<br/>
<br/>
If you look for ways and reasons to mess with the natural learning  <br/>
process, you might never see it.   You can hamper and inhibit it  <br/>
rather than nurturing it, if you&#39;re not careful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1907759833">---- I guess my bottom line question is what do you do when there is something in the way of your child learning something (that they themselves want to know)?----<br/>
<br/>
This might sound harsh, and I don&#39;t mean it to be, but regardless of your son&#39;s diagnoses, your approach to unschooling should be the same: follow his lead.  If he wants to learn to write his name other than the way he does now, show him.  His writing backwards isn&#39;t a &quot;problem&quot; unless you believe it is. Don&#39;t &quot;suspect&quot; anything just yet, dyslexia or otherwise. <br/>
<br/>
My daughter has a tic &quot;disorder&quot; as well.  She would probably qualify for a Tourettes diagnoses as she&#39;s had a motor and vocal tic for the past three years, but her neurologist doesn&#39;t feel the need, since we don&#39;t feel the need, to pin a diagnoses on her.  Sometimes it is pronounced, other times I&#39;m the only one who notices. Every now and again, it goes away for a month or so.  Whenever she&#39;s about to loose a tooth, swims in chlorinated pools, or is exposed to Strep, it is the worst.<br/>
<br/>
One of the most important things I&#39;ve learned about children and ticing is pressure and stress can make the tics more pronounced.  Drawing attention to the tic makes it worse.  If you read any of the forums for Tourettes and/or Tic disorders, you&#39;ll be asked to never, ever describe a tic, because for people who tic, simply reading about someone else&#39;s tic can make that same tic manifest.<br/>
<br/>
I know it is hard to watch your child move uncontrollably. You&#39;re unschooling though.  You can throw out the fear about what other kids will say and how he might be treated/teased in school.  From our experience, most kids don&#39;t even notice when our dd tics, they just think it is something she does--it isn&#39;t a biggie, at all.  And as far as she&#39;s concerned, sometimes ticing feels good, and more often than not, she doesn&#39;t even know she&#39;s doing it--unless, and this is key--I point it out.  <br/>
<br/>
The best thing, in my opinion, is to forget there is anything &quot;special&quot; as in &quot;special needs&quot; about your son. <br/>
<br/>
Would I choose more structure because of Tourettes--hardly.  I&#39;d choose less! The more freedom he has, the more likely your son will be to feel confident, safe and secure being exactly who he is, instead of having to try to be some kind of kid he isn&#39;t.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-991579201">I appreciate everyone&#39;s comments on this, and feel more confident in my approach.  I have been mostly quite laid back in terms of his Tourettes, and we don&#39;t talk about it with him, because he does not talk about it with us.  It just *is*.  The mainstream approach is of course to draw attention to these things, go to a bazillion therapies and such.  We have not done that.  It never felt right.  It is a question I had to ask though, because that tiny voice in my head tells me I cannot just do *nothing* about it.  I don&#39;t want to be negligent.  It&#39;s scary to break out of the mold.  Hopefully anyone else who reads this and has this question in their head as well, can feel at more peace as well. <br/>

<br/>
That tiny voice in your head is probably not your own voice.<br/>
<br/>
Most people have many &quot;tiny voices&quot; in their heads.  Some people&#39;s  <br/>
voices can be overwhelming and crippling.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t want to become a tiny voice in your son&#39;s head shaming him  <br/>
for being ways he can&#39;t avoid.  And even nicey-nice criticism or  <br/>
reminders can come back for 20, 30, 50 years as &quot;something is wrong  <br/>
with you,&quot; in the little-voices gallery.<br/>
<br/>
IF it&#39;s something he can fix through his own will or awareness, wait  <br/>
until he&#39;s older.<br/>
If it&#39;s not something he can fix, when he&#39;s older you might help him  <br/>
find coping mechanisms.<br/>
<br/>
In school, teachers and other kids would likely crush him for it, but  <br/>
he&#39;s NOT in school.  The tiny voices that say &quot;hurry up or it will be  <br/>
too late&quot; are very, very often afraid of school bullying.<br/>

how<br/>
to read or they will never do it right or have serious problems.<br/>

Unschooled children learn to read at all ages. There is only a problem if the <br/>
child is in school<br/>
or if the parent think there is a problem and turns it into one.<br/>

<br/>
The idea of &quot;sensitive periods&quot; has been pretty popular in education and psychology for a long time, and often confused with the idea of &quot;critical&quot; periods. I&#39;ve heard soooo many parents and teachers say &quot;if they don&#39;t learn it now it will be much harder later&quot;. That&#39;s something that has some validity in school, since there&#39;s a narrow window when certain skills are Taught and beyond that kids are often left to flounder And mocked by other kids. <br/>
<br/>
Not only do many of those concerns fall by the wayside once you child isn&#39;t held up to an expectation of &quot;normal&quot;, brain science is discovering that many more things that were thought to have &quot;critical periods&quot; - times when the brain &quot;had to&quot; learn certain skills or they wouldn&#39;t be learned - don&#39;t, and that people can go on learning into adulthood. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1453419009">I have Tourettes syndrome and OCD.  I sure wish my folks would have allowed me to learn at home!!  I endured so much teasing that it hindered my learning abilities in class and on the playground.<br/>
<br/>
One of my sons might have a very mild case of Tourettes and we unschool him. Things are working out wonderfully.  We just allow him to play and learn to handle his body and emotions on his time schedule.  Any issues that come up that are upsetting, his family is right there to give him lots of hugs and love.  Something I truly wish I had as a kids  <br/>
<br/>
I felt so alone at school.  People shaking their bodies and laughing at me.  Even people who are just scared and stare.  In time, he will learn to deal with it all in his own stride.  It&#39;s just so incredible helpful to have his family with him especially when he&#39;s little so he can have all the support that he won&#39;t get in school.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, I&#39;m doing all my ticks and twitches!!  LOL. Talking about Tourettes can make it worse. <br/>
<br/>
Best wishes to you and your family,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2058962882">&quot;Sensitive period&quot; is a term coined by the Montessori movement to describe those times when kids are both biologically ready and all fired up to learn something - with young children that often coincides. A &quot;critical period&quot; is a time of brain development when, and only when, an infant or young child can learn that specific skill.<br/>
<br/>
 A classic example is sound discrimination - if you don&#39;t hear certain language sounds before a certain age you can&#39;t distinguish those sounds later in life. A person can learn a skill &quot;later&quot; than a sensitive period, but not a critical period - so, for instance a person can learn to speak and understand a second language after the sensitive period for language is past, but may not be physically able to hear and reproduce all the sounds in that language (so will hear and pronounce l and r the same or t and th the same).<br/>
<br/>
But one of the upshots of the idea of &quot;sensitive periods&quot; - especially combined with the ways schools work - is a sort of cultural panic about &quot;early learning&quot;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sensorimotor development in general - vision being the other biggie because we don&#39;t really study things like taste and smell discrimination. But the exciting thing is that this is all out of date - new research is showing that people Can learn sensorimotor skills later in life, even adults. A quick search shows me all the things I learned were facts in college are now &quot;hypothoses&quot;, including sound discrimination.   <br/>
<br/>
The other big example that comes to mind is binocular focus, which was thought until very recently to be completely &quot;done&quot; developing in infancy or the toddler years. Turns out binocular focus can be learned by adults - NPR recently interviewed a woman who had learned in her 40s. That&#39;s great news for parents with kids with &quot;lazy eye&quot; and other such issues that are traditionally treated with surgery or eye-patches. There&#39;s a muuuuuch bigger window of opportunity to correct those problems, it turns out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1306670906">Here is a twist...when I was a teen I went to Paris.  I met some Americans<br/>
with heavy southern accents.  I couldn&#39;t understand them unless they spoke<br/>
slowly and repeated words, but the French waitress who spoke English as a<br/>
second language could understand them. She could also understand my Canadian<br/>
accent and the English accent of British Tourists just as easily.  The<br/>
British Tourists I had to listen carefully to understand, though English is<br/>
the language I function in everyday.<br/>
<br/>
The  English speakers I could understand easily were from New York, from<br/>
Michigan and Iowa.  But the French, who spoke English as a second language<br/>
with heavy French accents could understand us all easily! Obviously, there<br/>
needs to be a theory with respect to this situation,because it seems so<br/>
illogical to me.<br/>

<br/>
I went to student teaching, car ride across town, with a guy from  <br/>
Boston and one from Farmington, New Mexico.  The later &quot;talked like a  <br/>
cowboy.&quot;  Most people in New Mexico don&#39;t.  This one town happens to  <br/>
have some of that accent, even though it&#39;s near four corners (not so  <br/>
near Texas).<br/>
<br/>
I could understand them both perfectly well, but they couldn&#39;t  <br/>
understand one another.<br/>
<br/>
I have a Brit friend, from Birmingham, mostly.  He&#39;s lived in New  <br/>
Mexico for years, but maintains his accent.   When he was asking for  <br/>
water in Oklahoma, the waitress couldn&#39;t begin to understand him.   <br/>
Others had to translate, because he refuses to say what water sounds  <br/>
like in Oklahoma.  He was saying wattah and the waitress needed to  <br/>
hear wadderr.  He has no &quot;r.&quot;  Sometimes I say &quot;R, please, Charlie&quot;  <br/>
when I can&#39;t understand him.  But that&#39;s Boston&#39;s problem too.  Not  <br/>
much &quot;r.&quot;  I understand Irish accents better than English, generally,  <br/>
because they have a prominent &quot;r.&quot;<br/>

languages would go like this:<br/>
<br/>
The Norwegian and the Dane will understand each other, the Swede and the<br/>
Norwegian will understand each other, but the Dane and the Swede will give<br/>
up and resort to English to be able to communicate.<br/>
<br/>
This is partly because in Norway, kids start hearing Danish and Swedish at<br/>
an early age from tv (few programs are dubbed/voiced over). They hear<br/>
English all the time too, so their &quot;window&quot; is wide open all the time for<br/>
learning all sorts of sounds of language.<br/>

I haven&#39;t had much trouble with it. I wonder if it&#39;s because I&#39;ve  <br/>
grown up with British accents in my family, more recently watching  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1225190197">Brian (my Brian at any rate) can imitate sounds and speak foreign<br/>
words from just about any language with no accent, including Chinese,<br/>
without learning the language fluently. Foreigners do a double take<br/>
when he says a word from their homeland after listening to their<br/>
accent and without asking where they&#39;re from. He picks out what their<br/>
native tongue is. English is the only language he knows fluently.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You don&#39;t want to become a tiny voice in your son&#39;s head shaming him <br/>
for being ways he can&#39;t avoid. And even nicey-nice criticism or <br/>
reminders can come back for 20, 30, 50 years as &quot;something is wrong <br/>
with you,&quot; in the little-voices gallery.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And, as is the case with us *right now*, it can come back much sooner and quite unexpectedly.<br/>
<br/>
Long story short our youngest son when he was between the ages of 3-5 exhibited some symptoms of what looked like Asperger&#39;s.  I didn&#39;t even think that until a close friend gently suggested it.  Back then, I sorta went through some denial and avoidance, and then became a bit fixated on it.  I wasn&#39;t willy-nilly in talking about it with others, but I did explore what the suggestions were for kids with Asperger&#39;s, and I implemented some of them.  We saw a naturopath, but we didn&#39;t seek a diagnosis or label.  We made some dietary changes and I changed the way I interacted with him.  I changed our expectations of how he&#39;d navigate social situations, and I was more careful in where we&#39;d go, when, and with whom.  All those things helped.<br/>
<br/>
But just the other day my oldest was telling his best friend about that, and he casually asked my husband, &quot;What was it you thought Jonathan had?&quot;  Which led to Jonathan saying, &quot;What do you mean I HAD something?&quot; I wasn&#39;t there to help navigate that conversation.  It was news to Jonathan that we&#39;d ever considered something to be wrong with him.  There&#39;ve been several questions since - What kinds of things did I do?  How long was I like that?  What was it called again?  What do you mean I couldn&#39;t go to some places?  What would I do?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been very upsetting, and I regret that I let it consume us for a while.  Alas, I cannot go back in time.  Many of the things I learned about dealing with people who are very sensitive still serve me to this day.  I never expect that a kid will (or will want to) talk to me, for example.  I am very respectful of their space.  BUT, even though it&#39;s been a long time (12 yrs) since that original period of worry and focus, it&#39;s affecting my son&#39;s self-esteem and view of himself NOW.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-882840303">I think part of what you&#39;re looking for here is a discussion of phonemes (the smallest contrastive unit in the sound system of a language -- that is, that makes a difference in meaning -- why &quot;fried rice&quot; and &quot;flied lice&quot; (the &quot;r&quot; and &quot;l&quot; in English making a difference that they don&#39;t in some Asian languages).<br/>
<br/>
Helen Keller did learn to speak, but needed a translator to be understood -- still amazing, as she was in general.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
There are a number of different aptitudes in language acquisition . . . auditory processing (and the ability to distinguish new phonemes), vocabulary acquisition, and a talent with a new grammar being among them. <br/>
