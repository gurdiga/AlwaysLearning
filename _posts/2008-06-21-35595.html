<div id="ygrps-yiv-854962888">My kids are 7,5, and 2 and have never been to school.<br/>
<br/>
My husband has had doubts about unschooling over the<br/>
years. I think he likes the fact that they are home<br/>
and have lots of freedom and time, but he has always<br/>
expressed concern that they are not having &quot;lessons.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tried reading him posts from this and other<br/>
sites, talking to him about it, having dinner with<br/>
another unschooling family with slightly older kids to<br/>
discuss how unschooling works for them, writing down<br/>
everything my oldest did in a week to show how much<br/>
she&#39;s doing and learning, etc. <br/>
<br/>
I hoped that, in time, he would see how well she&#39;s<br/>
doing and how much she&#39;s learning and have more<br/>
understanding and confidence that unschooling works.<br/>
<br/>
Well, he told me last night that he firmly doesn&#39;t<br/>
think we can continue this way, and something<br/>
different needs to be done. He just doesn&#39;t believe<br/>
that people can learn skills like reading, writing,<br/>
math without daily structured practice. He thinks we<br/>
are doing our kids a real disservice, and he insists<br/>
that either I start incorporating that kind of thing,<br/>
or he will enroll our oldest in school.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m heartbroken and scared. <br/>
<br/>
What do I do?? What would be less damaging to my kids<br/>
-- to send them to school or to bring it into our<br/>
house?<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone ever done some academics to appease the<br/>
spouse? If so, what did you do, and how did it go?<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions/resources/thoughts about how I can do<br/>
something that will satisfy him, but cause the least<br/>
damage and misery?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Jenny<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re also married.  It would be great for you to stay that way.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not worth heartbreak.<br/>
<br/>
-=-What do I do?? What would be less damaging to my kids-- to send  <br/>
them to school or to bring it into our house?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Bringing it home would be less damaging, in my opinion, if the kids  <br/>
want to stay home.  If the kids want to go to school, then keeping  <br/>
them home against their will would be damaging.  The question of  <br/>
&quot;damage&quot; can&#39;t be answered without us knowing much more, so it&#39;s  <br/>
better for you to figure out what your beliefs and goals are, and  <br/>
holding the situation up against that.<br/>
<br/>
Having a happy family seems more important to me than the particulars  <br/>
of how the kids learn.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not the end of the world if you &quot;do school&quot; a bit for a while.   <br/>
If it doesn&#39;t work out well, your husband will see that. If you won&#39;t  <br/>
even make a real good-faith effort, he&#39;ll see that too, though.  A  <br/>
divorce will pretty much guarantee school for life.  School at home  <br/>
for a while doesn&#39;t preclude less structure as time goes on.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe look at some unit studies sites.  You can make things look  <br/>
really schoolish without them being school-style schoolish.   If you  <br/>
have the money to do it, maybe consider signing up with Clonlara.org<br/>

&gt; -- to send them to school or to bring it into our<br/>
&gt; house?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would think keeping them home would be best.   Your husband is just<br/>
concerned and wanting what is best for his kids and he really doesn&#39;t<br/>
know another way.  It can be very scary to let that go.  Some people<br/>
find it difficult to step outside the box.<br/>
<br/>
Your kids are young and what can look like structured learning can<br/>
really be fun. So, maybe if it&#39;s presented to your husband as more<br/>
schooly, he&#39;ll see it that way?  The Family Math Book<br/>
((<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Family-Math-Equals-Jean-Stanmark/dp/0912511060)">http://www.amazon.com/Family-Math-Equals-Jean-Stanmark/dp/0912511060)</a><br/>
has some fun stuff.  Computer software games, dot to dots, hidden<br/>
pictures, tangrams (I&#39;d recommend Grandfather Tangs journey to go along<br/>
with it), science experiments (there are tons of books for this stuff),<br/>
legos, marshmallows and toothpick building, lots of library trips??<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the kids could pick out something they really liked, like mummy&#39;s<br/>
or trains and you could do a unit studies on them?  And then maybe you<br/>
could just do the fun stuff that they like??<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could sign them up for an art class or join a lego league, or<br/>
a library/book club, TKD, scouts, roots and shoots, 4-H, science center<br/>
or zoo classes?  Maybe that would help your hubby&#39;s worrys?  Maybe you<br/>
could start your own art club, game club, science club or something like<br/>
that?<br/>
<br/>
Also, when my husband has moments of worrying I&#39;ll cut and paste snip<br/>
its of Sandra or Joyce&#39;s site (my son is a later reader and so he has<br/>
had moments of worry).  In the beginning, I would leave books in the<br/>
bathroom or magazines.  Some copies of growing w/out schooling, dumbing<br/>
us down, holt, etc.  These might get read in the bathroom  [:)] ?  And<br/>
maybe he&#39;ll relax more and trust them more?<br/>
<br/>
Just cause he&#39;s feeling this way right now, doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;ll feel this<br/>
way in a month or a year.  Maybe he&#39;s needing some reassurance right<br/>
now?   I mean I&#39;m guessing he&#39;s probably not wanting to check work or<br/>
anything?    Maybe he just needs to hear things in schooly terms?  Maybe<br/>
if they&#39;re presented as &quot;lessons&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Wow, that is a lot of &quot;maybes&quot;!!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Since you have done so much showing him of how unschooling can work, <br/>
and he still has doubts, I would say that these fears are about him, <br/>
not what you are doing or not doing.<br/>
<br/>
When my dh gets into a place of doubt about our path, which is <br/>
extremely rare, or I do, also rare, it is usually because something <br/>
else is happening outside of our family life that is disturbing our <br/>
flow or serenity. <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps your dh is having fears about money due to this economic <br/>
downturn, and has negative visions of your kids being destitute. <br/>
Perhaps some blowhard at his work is boasting about the ap math their <br/>
kid is shining in. Perhaps he is having unacknowledged mental <br/>
flashbacks to when he was the age your eldest is now and emotions are <br/>
being brought to the surface. Maybe gently probing where his fears <br/>
are will be helpful.<br/>
<br/>
It is always frustrating when a spouse has the problem but expects <br/>
you to implement his or her solution! I feel for you on that. But <br/>
experience has shown me that getting caught up in resenting that <br/>
dynamic only digs you into a deeper emotional hole. <br/>
<br/>
Being the sounding board for my dh&#39;s doubts without judgement (and <br/>
that is hard too sometimes!) usually allows him to talk himself out <br/>
of the doubts. It usually takes him hearing himself speak to realize <br/>
how silly he actually sounds, and for him to realize and acknowledge <br/>
the fear he is sitting in at that moment.(eg &quot;Will Jayn ever stop <br/>
being so selfish?&quot;). We also talk a lot about our own childhoods. It <br/>
has taken many conversations to peel back layers and find hidden <br/>
resentments below the obvious ones.<br/>
<br/>
I would try working with your dh on coming up with a plan, focussed <br/>
heavily on your dd&#39;s interests. Maybe you are imagining a lot more <br/>
than he is in terms of &quot;structure&quot;. Perhaps clarify exactly what he <br/>
means by &quot;lessons&quot;, and what his mental timetable is. You might find <br/>
that you are envisioning 4 hours at the kitchen table, but he is <br/>
thinking of a worksheet every other day.<br/>
<br/>
Also I would step up the strewing. <br/>
<br/>
Finally, you say you have shown him lots of stuff from other <br/>
unschoolers, and it hasn&#39;t taken. So move on to other educational <br/>
experts. Show him some stuff from Montessori and Piaget about child <br/>
development, and the research supporting delayed academics. <br/>
<br/>
Keep you goal &quot;helping him relax and trust&quot; rather than having your <br/>
goal be &quot;holding on to unschooling for dear life&quot;. If you have the <br/>
former goal in your heart, your energy will different even while the <br/>
words coming out of your mouth are the same.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If you can&#39;t cut and paste the link, just got to Amazon and look it  <br/>
up.  Used from $4.83 and a big book full of fun stuff.<br/>
<br/>
You can mine these places for ideas (just don&#39;t tell him where you  <br/>
got them):<br/>

<br/>
Just don&#39;t tell your husband you&#39;re unschooling.  Tell him you&#39;re  <br/>
teaching in multi-sensory ways, and then DO IT.  Do it lots, fast,  <br/>
but make it fun.  Don&#39;t be stressed.  If you&#39;re going to be a stress  <br/>
case, maybe school would be better.  Find ways to be grateful and   <br/>
hopeful and happy and fun.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe every day you could play here:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://lyricsgame.blogspot.com">http://lyricsgame.blogspot.com</a><br/>
<br/>
Talk about the pictures and maybe follow the links (sometimes the  <br/>
pictures are clickable and go somewhere).  Think of songs.  It will  <br/>
end up tying in to art, history, vocabulary, spelling, music.<br/>
<br/>
There are other cool online sites for kids with all kinds of games.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1561977251">I can understand how upset and stressed out you must feel.  You Get <br/>
It, and your dear spouse doesn&#39;t.  It&#39;s a hard place to be.  I&#39;ve <br/>
always Gotten It more than my mate.  In the beginning he didn&#39;t get <br/>
it at all.  And while he never put his foot down, he definitely <br/>
voiced concerns and at times it got a little bitter and heated.  But <br/>
he and I have always had a bit of difficulty communicating about all <br/>
SORTS of things, so as Mary Gold said &quot;it&#39;s not the unschooling&quot;. ;-)<br/>
I&#39;m going to try and remember this as best I can because after 10 <br/>
plus years my sweetie doesn&#39;t have many issues with it anymore.<br/>
I know that with us I had a tendency to try and be very strong and <br/>
clear about unschooling being the right way, and in doing so didn&#39;t <br/>
always communicate ALL of what I was thinking (that is my OWN <br/>
concerns.)  Probably because I understood that my concerns were NOT <br/>
because of the unschooling but tied up with other things (i.e. my <br/>
ability to deschool myself) and I was trying to &quot;sell&quot; my guy on <br/>
unschooling.  Not a good idea!LOL  It came off to him as me just <br/>
brushing his concerns off.  He needed to be HEARD.  <br/>
You mentioned reading, so I&#39;m guessing that your 7 year old is not <br/>
reading and that might be what&#39;s getting him stressed out??  Maybe if <br/>
you acknowledged that it IS stressful, and that&#39;s it&#39;s NATURAL to <br/>
worry about our kids and that you worry too... <br/>
When I dropped my &quot;I&#39;ve got no worries and I&#39;m sure unschooling is <br/>
the answer&quot; stance and let Tim in on my own worries things got WAY <br/>
better.  When he saw that I had concerns and still thought <br/>
unschooling was the way we should go, he was better able to trust <br/>
that I was using sound judgement.<br/>
I definitely think that it would be better to have the children at <br/>
home and do a bit of math work than send them to school and have them <br/>
do math work in that environment.  Figure out with your honey what <br/>
the math goals are, and discuss trying to meet those goals without <br/>
worksheets?<br/>
It really helped my husband when I talked to him about long-term <br/>
goals.  That I was thinking ahead and that some short-term goals <br/>
(like knowing the multiplication table or such) would interfere with <br/>
my larger long-term life goals for the children.  That I wasn&#39;t <br/>
necessarily saying that that was a BAD goal, but that I was <br/>
prioritizing.  And I got him talking about HIS long-term hopes for <br/>
the children.  He needed to know that we were both heading the same <br/>
way, because he wasn&#39;t feeling that at first.<br/>
Oh yeah!  It also turned out that my trying to share things I was <br/>
reading on the web and in books was working AGAINST me!  For my guy <br/>
at least, he saw that as trying to bring &quot;other people&quot; into <br/>
our &quot;private&quot; discussion.  WHat he really needed was to hear MY <br/>
words, and MY thoughts.<br/>
yup...he&#39;s kind of black and white about things...and has trouble <br/>
with change...and is pretty traditional...LOL   What was he THINKING <br/>
marrying ME?!?!?! LOL    But he always gets it eventually, and I&#39;m in <br/>
it for the long haul ;-)  But best for the kids if you can have <br/>
harmony sooner than later.  <br/>

<br/>
Oh!  Another good point I hadn&#39;t considered.<br/>
<br/>
Look online for early reading worksheets or games, because LOTS of  <br/>
things are considered &quot;reading&quot; in school that aren&#39;t even nearly  <br/>
&quot;reading&quot; outside of school.  Sequencing, for one.  Mixing up the  <br/>
order of pictures from a fairy tale, or from an action (fishing pole  <br/>
empty, kid walking; line in water; kid walking carrying fish).  You  <br/>
could find/buy/make things like that, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
Stopping a video and saying &quot;What do you think will happen next?&quot; or  <br/>
stopping when you&#39;re reading to discuss what might happen next is WAY  <br/>
better than asking a kid to summarize later.  You can tell whether  <br/>
he&#39;s paying attention and what he&#39;s not understanding.  You might  <br/>
also discover he doesn&#39;t give a rat&#39;s ass what happens next, and you  <br/>
can close that book or turn off that show and do something else. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

<br/>
I agree, except the &quot;do math work&quot; part.<br/>
<br/>
Play games, count things, measure things.  Play with dice.  Learn  <br/>
math, don&#39;t &quot;do math work.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But these suggestions are in large part reminders to just DO  <br/>
UNSCHOOLING.  Make your lives busy and happy so the learning is just  <br/>
flowing through the whole house, in the car, your whole lives.  How  <br/>
could your husband doubt the learning if he&#39;s part of it?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re not at that point yet, stop talking about unschooling,  <br/>
start talking about homeschooling (which unschooling is anyway, and  <br/>
if anyone tells you otherwise, please send them to me because I&#39;m  <br/>
getting tired of the argument and would like to nip some of the  <br/>
season&#39;s bad advice in the bud).<br/>
<br/>
Do unit studies, do it like a big fun game.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s one:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/dot/elvis">http://sandradodd.com/dot/elvis</a><br/>
<br/>
While you&#39;re on YouTube, poke around for some other similar things,  <br/>
and follow those trails.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m hoping none of the suggestions for strewing and activities that  <br/>
people are suggesting for this thread seem like a lot of work or too  <br/>
much exploration for anyone here.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone  here is waiting around for kids to learn without making  <br/>
their lives rich and busy, please either get busier or stop saying  <br/>
&quot;unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, it&#39;s been an odd season with people coming and wanting  <br/>
THIS list to give them some kind of refund or customer service on  <br/>
some bad ideas they&#39;ve picked up elsewhere.<br/>

&gt; math without daily structured practice. He thinks we<br/>
&gt; are doing our kids a real disservice, and he insists<br/>
&gt; that either I start incorporating that kind of thing,<br/>
&gt; or he will enroll our oldest in school.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m heartbroken and scared.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What do I do?? What would be less damaging to my kids<br/>
&gt; -- to send them to school or to bring it into our<br/>
&gt; house?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I remember you had previous issues in this regard.  Is your MIL still<br/>
playing him against you?  If this is the case, my response would be to<br/>
agree to homeschool as long as he agrees not to discuss it with his<br/>
mother.  Keeping them home and doing school work would be far less<br/>
damaging than sending them to school.<br/>
<br/>
Spousal agreement is best for your kids.  If down the road, you end up<br/>
divorced and you&#39;ve been homeschooling, not unschooling, you&#39;re more<br/>
likely to be able to continue homeschooling, since it sounds like he&#39;s<br/>
somewhat in agreement to homeschooling.  If you disagree so much about<br/>
how you homeschool and it causes a divorce now, you&#39;ll likely never get<br/>
the chance to homeschool at all!</div>

to have an idea of what he wants, get him to help plan it out and<br/>
discuss ways to implement it.  Afterall, you both have an idea of what<br/>
is best.  School at home seems to be a nice middle ground for now.  As<br/>

structure things a bit differently...Take a look at your daily <br/>
activities and see how they might be identified as &quot;school&quot;,  turning <br/>
things into unit studies almost...when you have the kids help with <br/>
the grocery list, copy that and stick it in a folder marked <br/>
handwriting...then at the store have a &quot;basic&quot; math lesson, keep <br/>
track of what you did and show him the Math work, We have a kids cook <br/>
book with recipes from around the world and information about the <br/>
culture and geography etc, that I kid you not, I could use just that <br/>
as a jumping off point for a whole years study for my three youngest- <br/>
ages 5-15...Here in Ohio we have to have a porfolio review or do <br/>
standardized test at the end of each year...So it puts me into a <br/>
well, let&#39;s see... what is our Literature, or Geography etc...We do 4-<br/>

up being fairly schoolish and we have lots to show in our portfolios <br/>
too, I would try to make it as stress free of an introduction to <br/>

what started ww2,who&#39;s hitler, what&#39;s prohibition, what&#39;s a victory<br/>
garden, why can&#39;t the black kids play ball with the white kids (what<br/>
an embarrassing part of history to explain), discussing that it&#39;s the<br/>

led to an inflation discussion, etc. etc.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1958818570">There are a number of costs to being a single parent and to divorce. One of the costs is economic. But another one is having a third party, the court, negotiate between different points of view. If your husband, soon to be ex, isn&#39;t comfortable with homeschooling in general or unschooling in particular the court may actually decide that your children must go to school. So whether or not you are able, as a single parent, to afford a life of you being at home may be moot if your children have been mandated by the court to go to school. <br/>

&quot;Obey&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Is that really what you see in that?<br/>
<br/>
There have been dads come here and similar places saying &quot;I really  <br/>

unschooling but my wife&#39;s not interested.&quot;  They get the same  <br/>

<br/>
A child&#39;s dependency IS strong and parents shouldn&#39;t cavalierly risk  <br/>
that, when there are two parents in the picture.<br/>

As to &quot;don&#39;t rock the boat,&quot; that&#39;s a great phrase to use.  Without  <br/>

<br/>
There are ways to move toward unschooling and to help the hesitant  <br/>

<br/>
I disagree.<br/>
I rocked the proverbial boat BIG time. I refused to play along at<br/>
things I did NOT agree with. I told my dh that if he wanted to teach<br/>
the children math concepts or whatever he deemed necessary he was<br/>
welcome and I would be fine with that, but don&#39;t ask me to do<br/>
something that would eat away at my very spirit because I did not feel<br/>
it was helping my relationship with my children.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think we&#39;d be where we are now if I&#39;d fed his fears by going<br/>
along with what he wanted. I know without a doubt that we got here<br/>
partly by his eventual willingness to learn and change, and hugely<br/>
because I refused to do what he thought necessary.<br/>
<br/>
My huge issue with this entire scenario is that there are deeper<br/>
issues in a relationship if a spouse is laying down the law and saying<br/>
&quot;this is what will happen&quot; rather than &quot;how can we make this work?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was fine with other solutions that didn&#39;t involve me being made to<br/>
do something I didn&#39;t agree with. NObody should be trying to control<br/>
anyone else in the family and if a spouse says &quot;here&#39;s how it&#39;s going<br/>
to be&quot; there are a lot of issues to be dealt with before unschooling<br/>
will work. Sounds like a focus on the trust in the relationship might<br/>
need to come first.<br/>

~~<br/>
<br/>
This will happen in almost EVERY case when and ex disagrees with<br/>
homeschooling and takes it to court. The courts are not kind to women<br/>
and children most of the time. Nor do they understand much about<br/>
homeschooling so they go with what they think is best.<br/>
<br/>
So if you have a situation where a divorce is definite, be aware that<br/>
your right to homeschool only extends as far as the ex is willing to<br/>
allow it. Talk about control eh? It sucks.But I think what people<br/>
forget in most divorce cases is that you are still stuck with whatever<br/>
behaviors or difficulties you have with that person.<br/>
<br/>
I was fortunate.<br/>
My dh and I were headed for divorce back in 2000.I was a single Mum<br/>
for a little over six months. It was a very amicable separation and we<br/>
would have continued our happy unschooling life without any problems.<br/>
He was totally supportive and present...we still viewed ourselves as<br/>
partners in raising the children. That isn&#39;t always the case<br/>
though...some exes can make your life a living hell,even moreso when<br/>
you&#39;re apart.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-522193383">Don&#39;t assume the kids get to live with mom either - The kids could be &quot;given&quot; to the dad by the courts and weekend visitation to the mom - I saw one case of a friend where the dad got the kids and she had to work to pay child support to the dad!!!!!  AND he was the one that cheated on her - which is why she asked for the divorce in the first place.  Divorce can be very nasty and ugly if the parties involved are fighting and being vindictive.<br/>
<br/>
I saw my own parents divorce after 25 years of marriage - A marriage I remember as being &quot;just fine&quot; no fighting, abuse, etc.  The 3 older of us children were grown, I was 18 and next to the youngest but my younger sister was only 5.   It was ugly for years and years afterwards - my mom suddenly walked out on dad for another man, I saw my dad get down on his knees and beg my mom not to leave him.  My brother was 21 and he did not speak to my mom for 20 years - while my older sister and I struggled mightily with it all - things like where do you stay when you go home to visit - as we would not stay with mom due to the man, etc.  Anyway, I watched my dad struggle to pay child support and had no say so in how the money was spent - for instance the other man could spend it on his kids, go to the bars, etc.  I saw my dad buy things for my sister and then the other man would sell it for the money.  If my dad took my sister shopping and bought her clothes or bought groceries for them it did not count as child support - he had to pay the money / cash.   When my younger sister was with dad she never mentioned mom and when she was with mom she never mentioned dad.  When she was old enough to ask, she asked to live with dad (high school) but mom fought it; so back to court they had to go and the courts said yes.  It&#39;s been 27 years and my dad has passed away BUT it still effects our family dynamics.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying one should stay in an abusive relationship of course BUT I agree that hitting things head on like a train wreck is not always the best solution.  I love some of the suggestions about slow and steady concerning the homeschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1692233074">I&#39;m a dad who&#39;s been watching this thread for a few days and would like to<br/>
weigh in.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering if the real issue at the heart of the original post isn&#39;t<br/>
significantly deeper than unschooling. We&#39;re talking about a spouse who is<br/>
practicing &quot;I don&#39;t care what&#39;s important to you, do this or else&quot; behavior.<br/>
Now, there are a couple of resolution paths here. First, we need to look<br/>
at the husband&#39;s words and actions and try to figure out what his motivation<br/>
is for them - is it a fundamental disagreement with unschooling, and if so,<br/>
why (concern about develpment, socialization, future &quot;success&quot;, etc.) Can we<br/>
find a way to allay those fears with facts?<br/>
<br/>
Or is it a disagreement about parenting styles that is leading him to want<br/>
to gain control of something, that merely reflects itself in the unschooling<br/>
lifestyle because it&#39;s an easy target (which might suggest family or<br/>
marriage counseling.)<br/>
<br/>
Or, most troubling, is this a fundamental disrespect issue in which the<br/>
husband is attempting to assert his beliefs because he does not value the<br/>
wife&#39;s beliefs (likely about far more than unschooling, if this is the<br/>
case?) This is the one that could potentially lead to a divorce, I suppose -<br/>
counseling first to see if it&#39;s reconcilable maybe? But here&#39;s my concern -<br/>
if a spouse stays in a relationship in which they&#39;re not respected and<br/>
acquiesces to &quot;do it my way or else&quot; behavior from their partner to &quot;keep<br/>
the peace&quot; or &quot;save the children&quot;, do those two goals ever get met? Of<br/>
course not - they merely lead to house in which one partner is dominating,<br/>
one is disrespected and bitter, and the kids are caught in the middle and<br/>
learning BOTH of those behavior sets because that&#39;s what&#39;s being modeled for<br/>
them. That&#39;s scary - I know, it&#39;s how I grew up and it&#39;s taken me a long<br/>
time to get through.<br/>
<br/>
So I guess what I&#39;m saying is that unschooling is a lifestyle choice - and<br/>
like any lifestyle choice, it presupposes a household environment of respect<br/>
and dignity for everyone. I think you have to resolve that stuff first<br/>
before you can consider how to live your lives together. If you have that<br/>
foundation, then you have a foundation from which to support and help each<br/>
other through doubt, uncertainty, and misunderstanding.<br/>

&gt;   Don&#39;t assume the kids get to live with mom either - The kids could be<br/>
&gt; &quot;given&quot; to the dad by the courts and weekend visitation to the mom - I saw<br/>
&gt; one case of a friend where the dad got the kids and she had to work to pay<br/>
&gt; child support to the dad!!!!! AND he was the one that cheated on her - which<br/>
&gt; is why she asked for the divorce in the first place. Divorce can be very<br/>
&gt; nasty and ugly if the parties involved are fighting and being vindictive.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I saw my own parents divorce after 25 years of marriage - A marriage I<br/>
&gt; remember as being &quot;just fine&quot; no fighting, abuse, etc. The 3 older of us<br/>
&gt; children were grown, I was 18 and next to the youngest but my younger sister<br/>
&gt; was only 5. It was ugly for years and years afterwards - my mom suddenly<br/>
&gt; walked out on dad for another man, I saw my dad get down on his knees and<br/>
&gt; beg my mom not to leave him. My brother was 21 and he did not speak to my<br/>
&gt; mom for 20 years - while my older sister and I struggled mightily with it<br/>
&gt; all - things like where do you stay when you go home to visit - as we would<br/>
&gt; not stay with mom due to the man, etc. Anyway, I watched my dad struggle to<br/>
&gt; pay child support and had no say so in how the money was spent - for<br/>
&gt; instance the other man could spend it on his kids, go to the bars, etc. I<br/>
&gt; saw my dad buy things for my sister and then the other man would sell it for<br/>
&gt; the money. If my dad took my sister shopping and bought her clothes or<br/>
&gt; bought groceries for them it did not count as child support - he had to pay<br/>
&gt; the money / cash. When my younger sister was with dad she never mentioned<br/>
&gt; mom and when she was with mom she never mentioned dad. When she was old<br/>
&gt; enough to ask, she asked to live with dad (high school) but mom fought it;<br/>
&gt; so back to court they had to go and the courts said yes. It&#39;s been 27 years<br/>
&gt; and my dad has passed away BUT it still effects our family dynamics.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not saying one should stay in an abusive relationship of course BUT I<br/>
&gt; agree that hitting things head on like a train wreck is not always the best<br/>
&gt; solution. I love some of the suggestions about slow and steady concerning<br/>
&gt; the homeschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1166548439">-=-NObody should be trying to control<br/>
anyone else in the family and if a spouse says &quot;here&#39;s how it&#39;s going<br/>
to be&quot; there are a lot of issues to be dealt with before unschooling<br/>
will work.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Sure but that includes the mom saying &quot;Here&#39;s how it&#39;s going to be&quot;  <br/>
about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Sounds like a focus on the trust in the relationship might need to  <br/>
come first.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Put the kids in school to work on the relationship?  Work on the  <br/>
relationship in the  midst of telling the dad it&#39;s none of his business?<br/>
<br/>
Dad&#39;s gain confidence in unschooling when they see their kids  <br/>
learning naturally.  Even if a mom is &quot;doing&quot; something schoolish for  <br/>
an hour or two a day, she could pretty easily document how much more  <br/>
was learned in fun, easy natural ways on those same days.  I figure  <br/>
it wouldn&#39;t take but a few months for the dad to relax back down to  <br/>
&quot;whatever.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A mom who forgets their the dad&#39;s kids too risks them being the dad&#39;s  <br/>
kids ONLY.  I&#39;m seeing this unfold in slow motion with a friend  <br/>
who&#39;s  not involved in unschooling, but she wants to homeschool.  Her  <br/>
child&#39;s father is in England and the mom&#39;s in northern New Mexico.   <br/>
At every turn she&#39;s telling the dad she doesn&#39;t care what he wants or  <br/>
thinks.  It&#39;s building up to blow.  He&#39;ll likely have custody and the  <br/>
mom will have occasional visitation, if she doesn&#39;t chill out very  <br/>
soon.  The girl is only six or seven, and the mom is rejecting every  <br/>
bit of advice anyone offers.<br/>
<br/>
The dad can&#39;t &quot;make&quot; a mom create a school, but the dad can ask a mom  <br/>
to be a little more structured or pro-active, and the mom can collect  <br/>
some of the MANY artsy and fun ways to do that that people have been  <br/>
throwing out on this list and that are all over the internet.<br/>

<br/>
Every fiber of a child&#39;s being is affected by parents and divorce  <br/>
changes everything.<br/>
When parents have agreed that a child goes to a public school, or a  <br/>
private school, or not to school, that happens because the parents  <br/>
agreed.<br/>
<br/>
EVERYTHING is off when the divorce comes.  Nothing is guaranteed to  <br/>
anyone anymore.  What is guaranteed for the kids is that their lives  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-75013133">I understand that it is crucial to agree. However I am wondering for myself if I would have the strengh to <br/>
accept schooling to protect my marriage. I feel my life would be still too painful from having to see my kids go <br/>
to school every day.<br/>
<br/>
My husband also is not sure about unschooling, because his parents call him all the time about it and I really went through a period when he seemed enthousiastic about it.<br/>
I want my kids to have a happy life.<br/>
I also do not know what to do because, I have researched and spent time reading about the subject in extensive ways.<br/>
<br/>
When my focus should be on the family unit, I drift and make it about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Confidence in yourself is probably also key, isn&#39;t it ?<br/>
