I was afraid to listen to it because the night of the interview, things were awkward and rough at first.   But  I accidentally clicked it and it sounds okay. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I said “21,” but I was 20 when I graduated from the university.  I have a summer birthday.  I was 21 when I started teaching, which is the image I had in my mind when I told that part of the story.<br/>
<br/>
I’m getting tired of these stories.  But I hope some of you will hear some things you hadn’t heard before. :-)<br/>
<br/>
If I hear any other mistakes I made, I’ll come back and make a note. :-)<br/>
<br/>
And it won’t hurt my feelings if nobody listens or comments about it.  Please don’t feel obligated. :-)<br/>
