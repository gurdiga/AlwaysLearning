group of people I don&#39;t know during Cherry Blossom season?! :)  We had a<br/>

I live in Burke and have 4 kids and WAY too many pets.  I have boys 12<br/>

ago when they were in 1st, 2nd, 4th and 5th grades.  I&#39;d read the<br/>
Unschooling Handbook and many other books and wanted to unschool, but<br/>
it&#39;s so SCARY when you&#39;re just getting started.  I didn&#39;t buy a<br/>
curriculum on the theory that if I couldn&#39;t keep up with 5th grade and<br/>
below skills, I was in pretty bad shape!  We did a little work on our<br/>
own, but my fly-by-the-seat-of-my-pants personality quickly led to<br/>
unschooling, and we&#39;ve been very happy.  Everytime people say to me that<br/>
homeschooling 4 kids must be a lot of work, I say, &quot;not as much work as<br/>
managing 4 kids who are in school - we&#39;ve regained a peaceful life&quot;.<br/>
We&#39;re certainly not a typical family.  Lots of animals, little if any in<br/>
the way of religious beliefs, lots of volunteer work, learning to be<br/>
friends with heavily Christian homeschooler friends - an enlightening<br/>
and rewarding experience, no TV restrictions, no bedtimes, conversations<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1860525407">The Cherry Blossoms were beautiful, but the crowds were NOT!!<br/>
I pulled into DC about 11:00(running late a little, plus traffic) and <br/>
then spent a good part of 45 minutes finding a place to park.<br/>
We got to the mall around 12:00 and looked around hoplessly at ALL <br/>
the groups of people there.  My kids refused to let me walk up to <br/>
stragers repeatedly asking, &quot;excuse me, are you unschoolers?&quot;<br/>
So we went into the Natrl. Hist. museum.<br/>
It was way to crowded for me and my double stroller.<br/>
We walked around a bit, then decided it was too nice outside and went <br/>
and had a picnic, still hoplessly looking for folks who just seemed <br/>
to radiate &quot;unschoolers&quot;.  Man we blend well!<br/>
We then went to the Am Hist museum (crowded also)and then tried to <br/>
drive down to the Lincoln Memorial, cause it looked like rain and I <br/>
didn&#39;t want to walk that far in it.  HA! I got stuck in more traffic <br/>
for another 1/2 hour, with no way of hoping for a parking space.  So <br/>
with a very disappointed son, we headed out, but then got happy at <br/>
the suggestion of visiting grandma in Baltimore.  She was so suprised <br/>
when we showed up at her door.  It was worth the trip!  AND those <br/>
cherry blossoms.  The wind whipped up while we were waiting in <br/>
traffic to get out of DC, and some of the petals came into my van.  <br/>
The window was only opened a crack, but there were so many, and it <br/>
was like it was snowing.<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m willing to try again, but next time we need a big sign, <br/>
or all wearing red shirts or something, AND come when it&#39;s not so <br/>
crowded(I hate crowds if you haven&#39;t already guessed).<br/>
Though, you all could hike over to Ocean City and spend a day on the <br/>
beach with me!  Warm spring days are awsome here.  Empty beaches!<br/>

Also we do lots of things together in the evening and the kids come to work<br/>
