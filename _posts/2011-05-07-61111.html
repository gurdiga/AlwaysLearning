<div id="ygrps-yiv-373915418">I remember reading a series of posts last year about protecting our children from scenes in movies - to be kind to our children. My husband played my daughter the movie, The Wizard of Oz tonight. They&#39;ve been watching some scenes over the course of a few months on YouTube and two months ago, I took our daughter to see a very shortened and tamed musical version of it geared for all ages, which she loved. (I told her I would cover her eyes if there was anything that scared her and she wasn&#39;t scared.) <br/>
<br/>
I remember when I was younger, there were scenes from The Wizard of Oz that scared me. After she watched the classic movie version tonight, she said she wasn&#39;t scared at all. She&#39;s 3 years and 2 months old. Maybe she didn&#39;t understand it? She says Wicked Witch is her friend. I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s not kind for her to see the movie version of The Wizard of Oz. Any thoughts would be appreciated.</div>

 </span></blockquote>I was with you until the end :-) You were looking at your daughter.  <br/>
Paying attention to her reactions to help guide you on what else she  <br/>
might like. Then at the end you&#39;re looking at her through you-colored  <br/>
glasses and &quot;what you&#39;re supposed to see in 3 yos&quot; glasses.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than thinking in terms of protecting her from what she  <br/>
&quot;shouldn&#39;t&quot; see, help her avoid what *she* doesn&#39;t want to see. Sure  <br/>
seems like she enjoys Wizard of Oz! And help her with skills and  <br/>
strategies to avoid the parts that she doesn&#39;t, like covering her eyes  <br/>
or ears, muting, fast forwarding, skipping scenes, watching during the  <br/>
day, stopping when she wants to, watching Making Of documentaries.<br/>
<br/>
So kids are fine with bloody fight scenes but cringe at adults yelling  <br/>
at kids. Each child is unique. There is no one size fits all 3-yos on  <br/>
what they will like and what they won&#39;t like. When Kat was 3 we  <br/>
watched the Seven Samurai. It&#39;s black and white. It&#39;s in Japanese so I  <br/>
read the whole thing to her. It&#39;s 3.5 hours long and took us 2 or 3  <br/>
days to watch it. I believe she was also 3 when she was enthralled by  <br/>
Dances with Wolves, also over 3 hours. And she listened enraptured to  <br/>
Red Raptor on a long trip, which is an adult novel about a Utah Raptor.<br/>
<br/>
What bothered her in all the movies we watched was the toon being  <br/>
dissolved in the paint thinner in Who Framed Roger Rabbit and the  <br/>
skeleton that popped out in the beginning of Indian Jones.<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;m just picking out the unusual stuff we watched. She also watched a  <br/>
lot of more typical 3 yo stuff. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t know what will bother a particular child. Instead of  <br/>
protecting them from everything, be attentive, be helpful, use your  <br/>
knowledge and ability to search for information to help them find what  <br/>
they like and avoid what they don&#39;t like.<br/>

It sounds like you would have felt better if she had been afraid.<br/>
<br/>
When I was little, that movie was on TV once a year, and I watched it every year as far back as I can remember, through my teens.  The mean neighbor on the bicycle scared me more than anything else.   I thought the flying monkeys were great!  (But I had friends who were afraid of the monkeys.)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you should worry about what she understands or doesn&#39;t.   Let her experience it in her own way.  That&#39;s the way all of her life will be, and needs to be--that she might not and probably can&#39;t have your responses or experiences, because her own life is a different one, and she&#39;s a different person.<br/>

The dog being taken away to be destroyed and the uncle saying there&#39;s  <br/>
nothing we can do about it. Total powerlessness and helplessness. But  <br/>
the witch was pure fantasy.<br/>
<br/>
I can watch Alien, where the monster is creeping around the spaceship  <br/>
ready to devour people. But I can&#39;t watch Freddie or any of those  <br/>
creeper movies. Same plot but one is too close to reality and the  <br/>
other is obviously fiction.<br/>
<br/>
And some people will be the opposite perhaps. People are different and  <br/>
what bothers them will be different.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-357105905">Definitely watch your child.  Things expert rate as age appropriate are only<br/>
a guideline.  My experience is that kids are scared of real life<br/>
possibilities, especially being alone or hurt.<br/>
<br/>
My eldest Rowan(now fifteen) was traumatised and could not sit through Lion<br/>
King at age three.  The other three year olds who were frightened of lots of<br/>
other things seemed fine with it.  The dad at the party(it was a b-day<br/>
party) expressed outright disbelief--to him Rowan was a &quot;real boy&quot; who<br/>
seemed completely fearless going on slides and trying new foods/experiences<br/>
with less resistance than his daughter.  I took Rowan home as this was a<br/>
neighbour and out of earshot of this guys commentary.  He was always rating<br/>
the kids which made me uncomfortable and I always tactfully tried to diffuse<br/>
those situations.<br/>
<br/>
And the man was correct too. Rowan was fine with animatronix dinos that<br/>
roared or large-screen scary creatures at the museum which seemed to scare<br/>
kids  and expressed curiosity in the &quot;bat cave&quot; at a museum.  A long scary<br/>
tunnel with bats which many a child left in tears.  He watched documentaries<br/>
on dinosaurs.<br/>
<br/>
The Lion King had him bawling as soon as the dad died.  He ran out of the<br/>
birthday party and spent the rest of the weekend clinging to John(his dad).<br/>
Same thing with Bambi by the way.  Although he watched more adult movies<br/>
with people chasing each other with guns just fine.  A lot of the movies<br/>
that set up families like Disney and then destroyed them just scared the<br/>
pants out of my three boys.  They could handle Jurassic Park before they<br/>
could handle some of the made for kids movies.<br/>
<br/>
With three year old themes are important.  Separation from the aunt and<br/>
uncle was scarier for my kids than any of the other issues in the wizard of<br/>
Oz.  Crispin once vomited at a drop-in play group because a group of people<br/>
obfuscated his line of vision.  He could hear my voice but my the time I<br/>
wandered between the fifteen or so people to reach him he was sobbing.  The<br/>
other mothers could not believe my adventurous climbing toddler who seemed<br/>
so independent was so upset--they were sure he was sick.<br/>
<br/>
Its worth thinking about how some people hate &quot;sappy&quot; movies--perhaps its<br/>
the emotional manipulation and tragedy that is too scary or to real to life?<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, I was concerned because I had mentioned to other moms when my daughter brought up the wicked witch and they asked if we had seen the movie and I said only bits and pieces and they mentioned it was scary for them to watch - then I remembered there were certain parts that were scary for me to watch so I guess I was concerned that I was exposing my daughter to something that wasn&#39;t kind to her. <br/>
<br/>
It is helpful for me to remember she has her own experiences and she will figure out what is scary for her and what is not. I guess I cannot protect her from what might be scary because what is scary changes and everyone is scared by different things. I remember when I was younger some things scared me at the time and then once I understood them, they no longer did. So when we see movies, just take her lead and mention to her if she gets scared, she can cover her eyes or hug me? Seeing movies is relatively new to us because she has only recently been interested.</div>

<br/>
She&#39;s also been interested in dinosaurs and likes to watch dinosaurs eat other dinosaurs. There are some short BBC docudramas on Youtube where one dinosaur tries to attack another. My husband reminded me that our daughter has seen our cat eat a mouse - our cat is an outdoor cat and during the spring and fall months, our cat catches rodents with glee.<br/>

I didn&#39;t realize you weren&#39;t watching it with her.  That&#39;s not a big deal, but I had pictured her watching it with a parent or two.<br/>
<br/>
-=- So when we see movies, just take her lead and mention to her if she gets scared, she can cover her eyes or hug me? -=-<br/>
<br/>
Do you really need to tell her to cover her eyes?  Doesn&#39;t she know how to close them or look away?<br/>
And can she really hug you if you&#39;re not there?<br/>
<br/>
Give her the remote control and tell her if it gets scary to turn it off, or mute it.  Sometimes &quot;mute&quot; is enough.  Often the scariness is created by the soundtrack.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My daughter is another one who will happily watch Jurassic Park, but she was <br/>
scared of Cars, and wanted to turn it off.  For her, it&#39;s the suspense, not <br/>
what is happening, the not knowing.  If the movie is relatively <br/>
straightforward with little foreshadowing, then it&#39;s better than newer <br/>
movies that really try to create that anticipation of something bad about to <br/>
happen.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also really interesting to note that at 3, she would happily watch most <br/>
Disney movies: The Lion King, Finding Nemo etc etc, but once she hit 5 or <br/>
so, she suddenly didn&#39;t want to watch them anymore.  I suspect that as she <br/>
got older, she had more awareness of what was happening, and bits she didn&#39;t <br/>
pay much attention to before suddenly made sense, and were scary.  Be <br/>
prepared for what scares her, and what she wants to watch, to change.<br/>

That happens with little kids and playground slides and swings sometimes.  They might do something happily until they get old enough to see the danger and become fearful, and then they stop doing it.   <br/>
<br/>
It happens with grammar, too. :-)  They will say &quot;mans&quot; (for men) and &quot;mouses&quot; (for mice) even though they might have known the traditional/correct form.  When they learn that there are grammar formation rules, they start applying them even to exceptions for a while.<br/>

Yes. This is happening more and more as my daughter, Rowan, gets closer to <br/>
turning 5yo in June.  She enjoys scary movies and shows, and seems to like the <br/>
feeling  of being scared. However, parts of shows and movies that used to be no <br/>
big deal are now making stronger impressions.<br/>
<br/>
The other day she was watching an episode of Backyardigans, which she typically <br/>
has not categorized as scary, and there was a scene with the hippo character as <br/>
a green colored pirate ghost.  For some reason, this image stuck with her for <br/>
days.  She would come running in from outside, the playroom, her bedroom, saying <br/>
that she keeps seeing the green pirate ghost.  She was acting afraid in a <br/>
different, more lasting way than she has before.  She seemed to remember the <br/>
image more vividly and for a longer time.  It&#39;s been about a week or so since we <br/>
watched that particular episode; she has only stopped mentioning it within the <br/>
last couple of days.<br/>
<br/>
Rowan started watching shows and movies around 2yo. Since, she has seen The <br/>
Wizard of Oz, every Barbie and Disney princess movie (all quite frightening to <br/>
me in different ways), and a handful of other scary-ish movies and lots of <br/>
scary-ish shows. She has asked to watch a scary show almost daily for as long as <br/>
I can remember, and she has very often watched the scary scene in a show <br/>
repeatedly. I am curious if this will change. I&#39;m excited to find out.<br/>

My girls watched A Bug&#39;s Life several times when they were toddlers (under age four). We went a year or so without watching it. When they saw it after that break, they told me it seemed like a totally new movie and that it was full of good jokes they didn&#39;t remember. They laughed and laughed and retold parts to me the next day and laughed some more :)<br/>
