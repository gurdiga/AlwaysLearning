<div id="ygrps-yiv-188779291">Sorry, I realize that I probably should have created a new post with <br/>
my response to the Alphie Kohn thread:<br/>
<br/>
I had posted about 2 1/2 year old behaviors (or frustrations), <br/>
wondering how you would handle them from an unschooling approach:<br/>
<br/>
toothbrushing<br/>
hitting<br/>
terrorizing the cat<br/>
potty training process<br/>
<br/>
I am very excited about this group and have learned so much from <br/>
just taking a look through the posts.<br/>
<br/>
I am new to the group and have a 2 1/2 year old daughter.  We are <br/>
planning to homeschool and I am in the process of learning as much <br/>
as I can ;-)<br/>

Best of Health,<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll tell some things I did.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t force toothbrushing in any hold-them-down way at all.  I  <br/>
would say &quot;let me brush for a month,&quot; and I would stand behind and  <br/>
brush while singing the days of the week to Yankee Doodle.  One  <br/>
&quot;week&quot; per quarter of mouth.  Sometimes they&#39;d let me do more.   I  <br/>
would tell them the whole song was a month!  But some months had  <br/>
extra days.<br/>
<br/>
Hitting...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d hold the child and talk about the hitting while removing her from  <br/>
the area and saying hitting doesn&#39;t help, hitting makes it worse or  <br/>
whatever seemed appropriate, and sometimes rocking (swaying) helped.   <br/>
The older they got the more likely I was (especially with the boys)  <br/>
to remind them that hitting is illegal and they  need to figure out  <br/>
other things to do.   That if daddy hit a man he would have to go to  <br/>
jail, and even big strong people learn to use words or to walk away.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t talk her to death, just say real things, as appropriate each  <br/>
time.  Maybe dance to music while you&#39;re holding her.  Maybe she just  <br/>
needs a different point of view, time to breathe and relax.<br/>
<br/>
terrorizing the cat:<br/>
<br/>
I said &quot;NO.&quot;  I defended the kids from the pets and the pets from the  <br/>
kids.  I reminded them about claws and teeth, and said &quot;touch nice or  <br/>
don&#39;t touch at all.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
potty training process:<br/>
<br/>
I changed diapers until they wanted to stop using diapers.<br/>
<br/>
Marty needed nighttime something (small adult diapers worked better  <br/>
than pull-ups) for several years, and I just was patient and cheerful  <br/>
because it&#39;s cheaper to use a diaper than to wash the covers every  <br/>
day and buy a new mattress after a while.<br/>
<br/>
Let it be gradual.  Let them go more naked on warmer days, let them  <br/>
play naked in the back yard if that&#39;s an option and they want to.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1233784963">We are really laid back about potty-training..and all of ours used the potty before 4 (most before 3).  Anyway, I have a funny story about that -- my now 3 year old ds has been using the potty like a girl.  Every now and then he wants to try it &quot;like daddy&quot; but it never worked out.  So this week, he stood up to the pot and tried it like a boy and it made it.  He looked at me so excited and said..<br/>
   <br/>
  &quot;I did it!  I&#39;m strong! (flexing muscles) &quot;No wait&quot; (perplexed look on his face)<br/>
   <br/>
  ... &quot;I&#39;m Tall!!&quot;  It was priceless - hysterical!!<br/>
