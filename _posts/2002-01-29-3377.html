guy.  I hope he has a speedy recovery.  My three year<br/>
old loves to help me cook, stirring pots for me and<br/>
such.  But he is a very cautious type.  <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I caught him in the kitchen with a HUGE<br/>
butcher knife.  He had gotten the cheese out of the<br/>
refrigerator, unwrapped it, gotten a cutting board and<br/>
found a knife in the sink.  He pulled up a footstool<br/>
and was beginning to attempt to cut some cheese when I<br/>
walked in and gasped.  I asked him to please not try<br/>
to cut cheese alone and ask for help, he said &quot;oh, ok<br/>
Mommy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My older boy got 2nd and 3rd degree burns on his hands<br/>
when he was under 2.  He put his hands on a firescreen<br/>
on a gas fireplace that I did not know was on at my<br/>
parents house.  He ended up with mummy wrapped hands<br/>
for some time, with no fingers to use.  But kids heal<br/>
so quickly.  I can&#39;t remember how long it took for<br/>
them to heal, but he had criss-cross shaped burns over<br/>
both palms and fingers, and we rushed him to the ER as<br/>
well.  They gave us a wonderful burn cream that worked<br/>
wonders.  I don&#39;t remember what it was called, but it<br/>
was white.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-105040015">I am so sorry Little Max got burned.  That is so<br/>
scarry.<br/>
<br/>
Both of Roy&#39;s hands were burned when he was 13 months<br/>
old.  I had carried him and the laundry out to the<br/>
clothes-line and put him down on the grass, then<br/>
turned to hang the laundry.  All of a sudden there was<br/>
the most awful wail-scream and I turned to see Roy<br/>
crawling backwards from what turned out to be a HOT<br/>
ash pile. Both hands had glove shaped burns. He had<br/>
the mummy wraps for weeks and weeks. A debreiding<br/>
(sp?) at a children&#39;s hospital.  It was horrible. I<br/>
still feel anger at the person who left the ash pile<br/>
without saying anything, and at myself for not seeing<br/>
it before I put Roy down. Roy healed quickly and has<br/>
only a small amount of pigment loss on his hands.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone in the ER and the Nemours Children&#39;s Hospital<br/>
was wonderful.  <br/>
<br/>
Once, 34 years ago,in San Jose, Calif. a mother left<br/>
her toddler with me while she went to hospital to have<br/>
another baby.  I didn&#39;t know her name, or the hospital<br/>
name....she was in a bit of a hurry!! Things were<br/>
different in those days, amongst some , well, anyway. <br/>
I was renting a room in a large house with a bunch of<br/>
students.  This house had floor furnaces, which I<br/>
turned OFF, because of the little 18 month old girl. <br/>
But, one of the girl&#39;s boyfriends came to visit,<br/>
decided that the furnace must be broken, went down,<br/>
turned it on, without saying anything.  I came back<br/>
from a walk with the baby, put her down, and she<br/>
IMMEDIATELY ran over and feel on the furnace grate. I<br/>
took me a moment to realize she was burned instead of<br/>
just hurt from falling.  <br/>
<br/>
I DID get questioned by the police at the hospital ER.<br/>
 And, the hospital staff were inclined to not let the<br/>
child go back to her mother (she turned out to be in<br/>
the same hospital) but had me continue to hold her. <br/>
It was awful.  They almost wouldn&#39;t treat the poor<br/>
baby, because I wasn&#39;t a guardian!  I was also<br/>
horrified at the debrieding (harsh scrubbing) that<br/>
they did...and protested loudly! I was only 18. (Feb.<br/>
1969). It all worked out OK, in the end, as far as I<br/>
know.  And the burns were not so bad as I thought.  An<br/>
burn seems bad to me.  <br/>
<br/>
Poor little babies and burned hands!! Poor Mama&#39;s. <br/>
<br/>
Roy still likes for me to hold both of his hands<br/>
between my hands sometimes, when he feels vulnerable. <br/>
