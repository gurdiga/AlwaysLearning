<div id="ygrps-yiv-1639547023">I have been researching homeschooling all summer, and really want to do it and feel it&#39;s the right thing for my children. But now...<br/>
<br/>
I just found out that my 8 year old twins have been placed in the same classroom, with a good teacher team of 2 experienced teachers with great parent reviews. Just what I asked for and they listened to me! <br/>
<br/>
So what should I do? Send them to school, in a 30 student classroom, but at least they have good teachers and at least they are together, but there are still 30 students!<br/>
<br/>
The boys say they don&#39;t like school, they want to be home, they want to play, they don&#39;t like to &quot;work&quot;. They have been labeled ADHD and I don&#39;t want to medicate them to make them fit into school. I&#39;m not even entirely sure they have ADHD. <br/>
<br/>
My husband doesn&#39;t want to homeschool, and this will definitely be decisive for him. I need good arguments for keeping them home! I don&#39;t have anything except my gutt feelings!<br/>
<br/>
Please, share some experiences, opinions, advice with me!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1907710938">-=-. Just what I asked for and they listened to me!  So what should I  <br/>
do? Send them to school, -=-<br/>
<br/>
When I read that part, I was going to say &quot;Ask them what they want to  <br/>
do.&quot;  Because &quot;Send them to school&quot; doesn&#39;t sound like it was going to  <br/>
involve their choice.<br/>
<br/>
Then you wrote:  &quot;The boys say they don&#39;t like school, they want to be  <br/>
home, they want to play, they don&#39;t like to &quot;work&quot;.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So your other question was more like &quot;Should I send them to school  <br/>
against their will just because the school placed them with two  <br/>
experienced teachers at my request?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
To that, I would say no.<br/>
<br/>
Bigger than all that, though, is that your husband doesn&#39;t want to  <br/>
homeschool.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I need good arguments for keeping them home! I don&#39;t have anything  <br/>
except my gutt feelings!-=-<br/>
<br/>
You could read and watch some of these things and see if it makes any  <br/>
difference, but until and unless your husband thinks it&#39;s a good idea,  <br/>
you really can&#39;t do it, can you?<br/>

If there were only ten students and the teachers were the best  <br/>
teachers ever born, it would still be school.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1039526992">Hey katherine - <br/>
  Gut feelings are a lot. (well as moms we def understand that) I think men just don&#39;t always realize it. My husband  and I do not c eye to eye @ all for homeschooling and every discussion led to us each saying stop being so defensive... Or something like that. I had many sleepless nights imagining my kids going to school and me feeling horrible @ home. So I decided I just need to tell him what my heart says - I put together a very jumbled email of my thoughts - just straight from my heart and I think he understood then. I could never tell him in words because I wouldn&#39;t remember them at the rt time, or I would get to emotional... But he has now agreed to let me home school them the first 2 years and c how it goes! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1748586550">My husband did not agree homeschooling was a good idea.  He was very school minded.  My child wanted to homeschool because he was tired of listening to the teachers disiplining all the time.  (not him the other kids).  Anyway, hubby and I decided to go one year at a time.  He completely embraced it by the end of the first year.  I find it very funny when something will come up and he will tell someone &quot;that is why we homeschool&quot;.  Together as a family, Dad included, we  have gone from schooling at home to unschooling.  I love to see how far we have come together. Our kids are so much closer to each other and to us.  <br/>
