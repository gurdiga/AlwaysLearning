[but wait--I&#39;m using the cake-making analogy to branch off to another point]<br/>
:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  If<br/>
I wanted to make a cake, and had never baked or cooked before,  a cake<br/>
recipe that just said - do what ever seems best to you, use your<br/>
imagination -  probably wouldn&#39;t be that helpful.  If my friend, who<br/>
always had lovely cakes ( devil&#39;s food? )  had given me this recipe,  I<br/>
would have to assume cake just didn&#39;t work for my family.<br/>
It would have been much more helpful to have an ingredients list and a<br/>
plan for putting them together.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Kirby made his first cake a few days ago.<br/>
<br/>
It was super helpful that he was fifteen before he tried to make a cake.  He <br/>
was interested in how it all worked, so the level of explanation was great, <br/>
and he was entirely receptive to discussion of baking soda, and why the <br/>
&quot;toothpick inserted in middle comes out clean&quot; bit worked.<br/>
<br/>
We have high altitude considerations.  He was thoughtful and will probably <br/>
never forget that with baking that IS a consideration.<br/>
<br/>
What would not have worked from the recipe, what really needed an example to <br/>
follow, was &quot;grease and flour the pans.&quot;  I could have said &quot;experiment,&quot; and <br/>
his first cake would have been a flop, as mine was (because I tried to figure <br/>
it all out on my very own, because my mom wasn&#39;t a baker at all, whatsoever). <br/>
 My second was a flop too.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby wants to try again.  I asked how much help, if any, he wanted.  He said <br/>
he&#39;d like to do it with me in the room, and if I noticed him about to make a <br/>
serious error to say something.  We joked about how some people just do the <br/>
intake of breath, and if you say &quot;What?&quot; they say &quot;Nothing.&quot;  We agreed I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t do anything like that. &lt;g&gt;nts to make a birthday cake this Friday.  <br/>
AND a pot of meatballs to put over noodles.  (The meatball recipe is a <br/>
Campbell&#39;s soup, some additives, bought meatballs concoction, but his friends <br/>
had it here and loved it.)<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s really excited about learning to cook.  It was just time, he had real <br/>
reason, he&#39;s of an age to begin to muse about what if and when he might move <br/>
out, and because I never forced him to cook anything, it&#39;s a desireable adult <br/>
thing to want to do.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve started calling myself a &quot;cooking consultant&quot; for Cacie, meaning<br/>
I&#39;ll be around if she has questions, and I&#39;ll give a holler if something<br/>
is going really wrong. I didn&#39;t catch it when she used baking soda<br/>
instead of baking powder, or whole wheat flour instead of all purpose<br/>
flour... so maybe it would go better if I were more involved... but she<br/>
is so sensitive to people telling her what to do (except soccer coaches).<br/>
 This is probably the &quot;dance&quot; we struggle with most, when she asks for<br/>
help doing something, and I have to give her just the right amount of<br/>
help or information, but not too much or too little. Maybe because it&#39;s<br/>
sort of a new thing... I mean, in the past she might ask me to tie her<br/>
show, or make her a sandwich, but now she&#39;s asking how to make a cake, or<br/>
a cursive Q, or how to draw noses the way I do them. We sometimes get a<br/>
rhythm going, where I see where she is and give her thre next step in a<br/>
way she can understand... but just as often, she&#39;ll get lost somewhere<br/>
and I won&#39;t be able to see where she got lost, and she won&#39;t be able to<br/>
understand what I&#39;m trying to say... and it gets snarly. <br/>
<br/>
I am imagining that at 15 or 16 it will be easier. Nine seems to be the<br/>
beginning of a new way of thinking for her...<br/>
