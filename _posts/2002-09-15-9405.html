&gt; I&#39;m going to practice this part without taking a breath:  -=- When a newbie <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; starts mucking about <br/>
&gt; and asking why &#39;slop, mud or sand&#39; and not concrete, we throw bits of slop, <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; mud and sand at them until they get the idea that they sometimes have to <br/>

&gt; them everything they ever wanted to know.-=-<br/>
