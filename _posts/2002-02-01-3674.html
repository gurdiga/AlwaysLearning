<div id="ygrps-yiv-1493865321">Geez, wonder off for a little while and everyone goes bonkers!  <br/>
Super calloused fragile mystic hexed by halitosis???  &lt;G&gt; There&#39;s a<br/>
little karmic justice in store for someone and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going<br/>
to be pretty.   I sang that damn song all day!  <br/>
<br/>
Ok, I&#39;m Deb Lewis, I live in Deer Lodge, Montana and I&#39;ll be thirty-nine<br/>
in March.  Thanks to a strict vegan diet and exercise I look more like<br/>
thirty-eight.   I&#39;m not afraid of perverts, perverts are afraid of ME. <br/>
You would be too if you knew the secret definition of *vegan*.  <br/>
<br/>
Young unschooling moms relax!  There&#39;s whale snot enough for everyone. <br/>
You&#39;ll get your &quot;atta boys&quot;  when you express yourself as eloquently as<br/>
Sandra, Joyce, Pam, Pam and Sharon the blasphemer, among others. <br/>
Everyone  here wants to say YES you&#39;re right!  but can&#39;t if you only want<br/>
to argue.  <br/>
<br/>
Pam Hartley,  now that I know so much about you and where you live,  I<br/>
have a little something I&#39;m sending you.  Don&#39;t be alarmed if it&#39;s<br/>
roughly the size and shape of a Basenji Hound and yodels.  No need to<br/>
thank me.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to this list I&#39;ll be up all night watching Mary Poppin&#39;s trying to<br/>
reprogram myself.  <br/>
<br/>
Just an aside,  in our unlimited TV house, since Monday my son watched<br/>
one hour of the State of the Union address Tuesday night and the TV<br/>
hasn&#39;t been on since.  That may be due to his State of Depression over<br/>
the State of the Union address, I don&#39;t know.  But I AM relieved that<br/>
John Ashcroft won&#39;t have to look at nekked stone hooters anymore.  <br/>

<time>31 Jan 2002, at 11:35pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1752011078">I think this is kind of interesting. My youngest, Solvij, she&#39;s 7, is<br/>
really interested in numbers right now. This week she was looking at a book<br/>
called Puzzle Mountain we&#39;ve read a few times. There&#39;s a page in it with<br/>
pictures of tables of snacks with prices for each on little signs. The<br/>
puzzle is if you have 10 pp, how many snacks can you buy.<br/>
<br/>
She wrote on a piece of paper 10 and then started figuring out how many<br/>
snacks to get. So she chose the first one, which cost 2pp. She counted it<br/>
out on her fingers and then wrote down 8, how much she had left. Then she<br/>
kept going until she got to 0.<br/>
<br/>
But the interesting thing to me is that she&#39;s been using her fingers like a<br/>
number line for quite a while now and she knows the written symbol for each<br/>
finger. She still doesn&#39;t know how to say the name of all the numbers. When<br/>
she wrote down 8, she asked me what that number was called. And the other<br/>
thing is that she has her own names for some numbers. She says 1,2,3,4,5,6,<br/>
and 7. But she calls 8 &quot;snowman without a head,&quot; 9 is &quot;upside down 6,&quot; 10<br/>
is &quot;all the fingers,&quot; or &quot;both hands,&quot; and 20 is &quot;all the hands and feet.&quot;<br/>
The rest of us have started using her names, and I&#39;m going to really miss<br/>
it when she calls numbers by their regular old names.<br/>
<br/>
Then she was playing a Pokemon game on the gameboy and she had a piece of<br/>
paper and pencil next to her. She told me she was keeping track of<br/>
different trainers she had battled and how many times she battled them. She<br/>
made a little chart with circles that she then Xed out. She wrote the<br/>
numbers next to the symbols she made, put pluses in between them<br/>
vertically, then added the column up at the bottom.<br/>
<br/>
I love watching this stuff,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-213959433">Hi!<br/>
My daughter writes perfect numbers backwards. She will be 7 next week. I have not said anything to her because when I have in the past (back in the pre-unschooling/deschoolin days) she melted down. I don&#39;t want to hurt her feelings or have her think she isn&#39;t doing well. Usually I&#39;m okay with letting her do her thing and trust they will turn around in time. Then I get that inner critical self talk that says, &quot;you should say some thing.&quot; Then I think maybe I could get some fun number stamps or stickers to play with? Then I looked at what she is creating and think, &quot;lighten up, all is well.&quot; Thought I&#39;d ask here since I am learning all the time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-79234210">Hi, Dory,<br/>
<br/>
I recently did a quick Google on this because my 5 3/4y.o. dd does the same<br/>
thing. I wasn¹t worried, but more curious. Here is a quote I forwarded my dh<br/>
³First, I am an elementary educator. It is totally normal for early<br/>
elementary students to reverse letters and numbers. They &quot;should be done&quot;<br/>
late first grade because of good teaching but sometimes correction slips<br/>
through the cracks in even the best schools.² Keep in mind that is a school<br/>
environment where they are working on correcting, so I¹d disregard the<br/>
age/grade and just focus on the ³normal² part. I read in another of the<br/>
posts that their brains go faster than their hands; basically I think that¹s<br/>
saying it has to do with the immature hand-eye coordination wiring. Because<br/>
the symbols are still recognizable the child doesn¹t notice the ³error².<br/>
Since my dd has been interested I¹ve offered to write the numbers for her to<br/>
trace, but mostly I just let her do her thing and trust. As my dd says, ³I<br/>
like it that way.² LOL.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248713203">-=-My daughter writes perfect numbers backwards. She will be 7 next  <br/>
week. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Some kids will write entirely backwards--not consistently, but if they  <br/>
happen to write the first letter or number backwards, they&#39;ll continue  <br/>
to the left, all backwards, because they know the relationship of the  <br/>
shapes to each other, but are not yet attached to left-to-right.    <br/>
That&#39;s normal and bright; nothing wrong at all.<br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;s doing two digit numbers (dates or ages of older kids) and  <br/>
does both numbers backwards, that&#39;s cool.   If she&#39;s doing one single  <br/>
number or letter backwards, you won&#39;t know what she would&#39;ve done  <br/>
next, but it&#39;s not important.<br/>
<br/>
Playing with stickers doesn&#39;t have anything to do with it.   What  <br/>
might help (if you&#39;re in a rush, or you&#39;re worried) is magnetic  <br/>
numbers like for a fridge.   You could cut some out of paper, but  <br/>
those still have a good front and back, and won&#39;t make the  <br/>
difference.  If she plays with and touches those shapes of numbers  <br/>
(fridge magnets) it MIGHT help.  The 3 and 1 won&#39;t really make any  <br/>
difference, though, and the 9 and 6 are always confusing.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t worry.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Then I looked at what she is creating and think, &quot;lighten up, all  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My daughter is 8 and she still flips some of her numbers. She also consistently writes the first letter of my name backwards. She just doesn&#39;t &quot;see&quot; it right in her minds eye yet. It will come eventually.<br/>
<br/>
I remember as a child looking at a 3 and not being able to see any difference if it was written frontwards or backwards (back to back I could tell they were different, but couldn&#39;t have picked the right one). It wouldn&#39;t have mattered how many times someone corrected me, I could not remember which way to write it.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t point out the problem to your daughter. It probably won&#39;t help her get the numbers the right direction, and it might end up with her not writing as much. Just make sure there are lots of examples of numbers in her environment.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

It wouldn&#39;t have mattered how many times someone corrected me, I could<br/>
not remember which way to write it.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was the same way when I was a kid.  It lasted for years.  I started<br/>
associating letters and numbers and their proper directions with holding<br/>
out my left thumb a certain way, which I could remember was left because<br/>
I sucked that one.  So, I&#39;d hold my thumb a certain way and make sure<br/>
that whatever letter or number I was confused by, would look the right<br/>
way by how it worked with the direction my thumb was pointing.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s hard to explain without a visual.<br/>
<br/>
In school, it made me feel stupid, and other kids teased me for sucking<br/>
my thumb, but that part was necessary for me to get the writing stuff<br/>
down and knowing my left from right.  I was also ambidextrous, which<br/>
confused the heck out of me when I was trying to learn how to read and<br/>
write, and forced to use just my right hand for things.  I&#39;m less<br/>
ambidextrous now because of that.  Over twelve years in school using<br/>
only my right hand really did impact that.<br/>
<br/>
My 14, almost 15, yr old daughter still writes some letters and numbers<br/>
backward, but she can see immediately that she&#39;s done it wrong, and she<br/>
corrects it.  She didn&#39;t used to be able to &quot;see&quot; that it was wrong. <br/>
Using the computer and typing has really helped a lot!</div>

She does write double digits backwards too. Thanks Sandra! Now I&#39;m thinking it is very cool! :) So much of this, if not all, is me getting out of the way and just enjoying the ride.
