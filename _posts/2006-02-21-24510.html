<div id="ygrps-yiv-1333773974">&quot;I did actually mop my kitchen floor last week and the warm feeling of<br/>
accomplishment will last a month.  I&#39;ll probably mop it again in<br/>
April or so.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The only times I&#39;ve mopped my floor recently, have been after some<br/>
large disasterish sort of thing.  First there was a flour and water<br/>
explosion (named Jalen) that I thought I&#39;d never get off. Then more<br/>
recently, we were firing baking soda/vinegar rockets (film canisters)<br/>
across the house and we had that mess to wipe up.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to ignore white blobs all over the floor, so I mop. The only<br/>
other time it gets a regular wiping, is when Jalen or Sierra pull out<br/>
the Swiffer wet mop and overspray it (but have a great time in the<br/>
process).<br/>
