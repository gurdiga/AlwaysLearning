<div id="ygrps-yiv-83772666">Now that our ds is 10 he is very clean. He loves baths.   Sometimes he wants to wear some clothes that are dirty.  If it&#39;s somewhere where I feel that wouldn&#39;t be acceptable, I let him know and he changes.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s my job to let him know about the ways of the world we live in or the expectations of those around him. It&#39;s important info.<br/>
