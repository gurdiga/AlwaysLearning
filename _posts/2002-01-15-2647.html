<div id="ygrps-yiv-70812448">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;What is &quot;bread improver&quot;?  How big is the &quot;crumpet<br/>
ring?<br/>
<br/>
This seems similar to an unsweetned donut only not<br/>
deep fried. ????? Maybe what is sometimes called<br/>
&quot;quick bread&quot;?  I have an iron skillet that lives on<br/>
the stove top, and I bake a lot, so have all of the<br/>
ingredients....Will a metal cookie cutter work? or a<br/>
tuna can without the ends?<br/>
<br/>
SOS&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
LOL!! I have no idea what &quot;bread improver&quot; is! I made<br/>
some of these today with no bread improver and they<br/>
turned out fine. You could try using self-rising flour<br/>
(do they have that over here?), maybe &quot;bread improver&quot;<br/>
is added to it? Yes, you could use tuna cans (For all<br/>
the veggies - I used the shorter sized cans from<br/>
pineapple chunks - just make sure you don&#39;t fill it<br/>
too high). I suppose you could use cookie cutters as<br/>
long as they&#39;re deep enough and basic shapes (like<br/>
hearts and circles, or similar). <br/>

 </span></blockquote>&quot;Self-rising&quot; flour has baking powder in it.  Way<br/>
different from yeast.  Makes and entirely different<br/>
sort of bread.....quite good, but not a yeast bread.<br/>
