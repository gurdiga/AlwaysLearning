<div id="ygrps-yiv-590305716">Our last few weeks have been a seemingly ceaseless succession of new and deeper ways of &quot;getting it&quot;.  The changes have been swirling through our lives so fast, it&#39;s hard to catch them, define them...it&#39;s dizzying, but in a really, really wonderful way - like first love!<br/>
<br/>
One of the sticking points for me was to come to an understanding about certain relationships in my life that seem to drain far more energy than they supply...I&#39;ve known for quite a while that things would need to be different in order for me to fully focus on the amazingly wondrous relationships that fill our home.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been coming, in bits and pieces and snippets, for months now, and, over the last two or three weeks, all those pieces began to merge, forming a collage I could make out more and more clearly...<br/>
<br/>
The result is here, for those who are interested...<br/>

It seems so simple, now that I&#39;ve finally shifted my perceptions.  Why was it so hard before, to get to this place?<br/>

Be careful about &quot;finally.&quot;  Maybe it seems more simple now that  <br/>
you&#39;ve begun to shift your perceptions.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for pointing it out!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-811881947">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to thank Sandra Dodd who makes this group possible and who<br/>
gives so much of herself to all of us who are on this road of discovery and<br/>
possibly enlightenment.<br/>
<br/>
I was feeling really really tense and angry with my three-year-old while we<br/>
were at my in-laws house  Saturday night because he would not go to bed.  I<br/>
was nervous because of all these different reasons--what will they think if<br/>
he is up running around while they&#39;re wanting everything to be relaxed and<br/>
child-free etc, etc and all these other parenting-based ( or what will they<br/>
think of me ) worries running through my head.  Then I just thought, hmm.  I<br/>
wonder what Sandra Dodd would do....?  I knew I was stressing out waay too<br/>
much and getting angry with him, whom I love so much, for no good reason. I<br/>
apologized to him and gave him a long cuddle and then we went back upstairs.<br/>
His grandfather happened to be in this unusally great mood and read him five<br/>
stories.<br/>
<br/>
My son made a nest for himself on the couch and actually just fell asleep to<br/>
the sound of all of us talking.<br/>
<br/>
It was a wonderful success, and I felt bad for stressing in the first<br/>
place.  I was worried about all these different things, but it ended up not<br/>
being like that at all.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this doesn&#39;t sound weird, but it was really nice to have some<br/>
clear-thinking in the midst of my anger, and I feel like this list really<br/>
helps if you read it everyday because it keeps these parenting and<br/>
unschooling family values at the top of the mental list.<br/>
<br/>
 John Holt, Alfie Kohn and Gordon Neufeld have written books that can offer<br/>
a revolutionary paradigm shift that can change your entire world view, but<br/>
incorporating such a cultural sea-change into your family life can be<br/>
confusing, difficult, and isolating.  People like Sandra Dodd, Pam<br/>
Sorooshian, and Joyce Fetteroll and all the other moms and dads out there<br/>
who write here  are contributing to a community, albeit virtual (I&#39;d love to<br/>
go that conference in New Mexico), but hugely influential.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, everyone,<br/>

<br/>
I love John Holt&#39;s writings, but he wasn&#39;t a parent and he never  <br/>
unschooled any kids.  Alfie Kohn thinks homeschooling is a bad idea.   <br/>
I haven&#39;t read any Gordon Neufeld.<br/>
<br/>
When I read a book about solar heating, I really want that author to  <br/>
be living in a solar-heated house. &lt;g&gt;  Perhaps I&#39;m unreasonable about  <br/>
that, but I like reading about unschooling (or hanging out with) those  <br/>
who have done it better and longer than I have.    I was privileged  <br/>
(LUCKY!!) to have known two unschooling families well before I even  <br/>
thought about homeschooling.  I wasn&#39;t planning to homeschool and knew  <br/>
four homeschooling families, but two were unschoolers, and it was like  <br/>
the difference between night and day, those families.  So that made it  <br/>
easy for me, and ever since I&#39;ve been trying to pass on some of that  <br/>
with words.    It can be easier to see it in person, but it&#39;s not  <br/>
always possible, and to chance upon unschooling families in the wild,  <br/>
as it were, in 1986.... well I totally hit the jackpot there.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s weird.  It&#39;s easy to be sucked into doubt and  <br/>
negativity in the world.  I could walk 200 yards in any direction and  <br/>
find someone willing to piss and moan with me about how this or that  <br/>
is stupid and wrong.  I&#39;ve tried to keep this list from being one of  <br/>
those places.<br/>
