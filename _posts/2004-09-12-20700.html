<div id="ygrps-yiv-1305107728">I should state up front that I feel part of my purpose in life <br/>
is to help others better understand their children&#39;s needs, and I <br/>
myslef am learning more about understanding them daily! That said I <br/>
think that for a child&#39;s education to include his/her community is <br/>
important, I would like for my child to actually have more community <br/>
opportunitites. <br/>
    But how do I help with this? Unfortunately I&#39;m not the greatest <br/>
friend maker in the world so getting someone to listen to my point <br/>
of view is a rare experience, unless you count the poeple who arn&#39;t <br/>
my friends who just happen to be treating my child or their children <br/>
so poorly that I just have to speak up and share. How can I let my <br/>
child be partially educated by the community when the neighbors up <br/>
the street are drugging their children, starving them and forcing <br/>
them to &quot;get out of their hair&quot; ie go to school from 7 - 6 pm - <br/>
(That TUTORING is so important to them! They don&#39;t care that their <br/>
children are truely drop dead tired plus they are sick of being told <br/>
how stupid they are that they need constant tutoring!), or the crack <br/>
neighbors who just don&#39;t know where their children are, or the older <br/>
neighborhood child who has been raised with no form of caring and <br/>
constantly shows it with all of his disregard for everyone else <br/>
through his anger, cursing and destroying. I live in what I would <br/>
consider a middle-class neighborhood - and yes sometimes I wish I <br/>
lived in the country far away from everyone!Although I am certaily <br/>
happier than if I lived in the projects so I probably shouldn&#39;t <br/>
complain. <br/>
    So how is my community going to help with my son&#39;s education??? <br/>
I can&#39;t imagine being the constant &quot;neighbor guard&quot; all my life, <br/>
ie. - &quot;that&#39;s not the way you should treat people, you should treat <br/>
others the way you want to be treated, if you need something then <br/>
ask and I will work with you to get it, just because your friend <br/>
stole something doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s okey for you to, using <br/>
cursing words can hurt just as much as any other kind of words - you <br/>
can use any words you like around me but don&#39;t think I won&#39;t be <br/>
upset if you tell me to **** **** whatever, Yes Mom knows all the <br/>
words but I also know that they can make someone fell bad so that&#39;s <br/>
why I have resigned to use those words only on rare occasions or not <br/>
at all&quot;. Those are just examples, what I am trying to get <br/>
information on is how can the community be helpful in educating my <br/>
son - preferably other than &quot;don&#39;t do that!&quot; or &quot;can you see what he <br/>
did wrong?&quot; <br/>
   Everyday is a struggle! Just for me to go out into my community <br/>
with my child means that someone will probably treat him <br/>
disrespectfully, other than the - what grade are you in school? Why <br/>
arn&#39;t you in school now? My son may be a little big for his age, but <br/>
he isn&#39;t even the &quot;compulsory&quot; school age of 7 in my state - Just <br/>
because many parents send their kids starting at 3 (when the public <br/>
funding kicks in)! Or to see another child being treated poorly on <br/>
an outing is almost inevitable if there are children around! I am <br/>
the kind of person who dislikes being a homebody so this is such a <br/>
struggle for me! Where is this community that I would trust to help <br/>
with my child&#39;s education??? Do others of you feel this same way?</div>

Wow, have you considered moving?  Although I run into bummer people now and then, for the most part our community is friendly and people are generally accepting of homeschoolers.<br/>

 <br/>
Change your community.<br/>
 <br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean you have to move. It just means that you have to seek out  <br/>
those you&#39;d like to associate with.<br/>
 <br/>
Our *neighborhood* is made of of lots of retirees who keep to  themselves, <br/>
parents of older kids who believe in school, but not necessarily in  *our* <br/>
district (none of the kids go to school here where they&#39;re *supposed* to  go! &lt;g&gt;), <br/>
lots and lots of Christians (one&#39;s delightful daughter is going  straight to <br/>
hell because she&#39;s a lesbian)---and everyone pretty much keeps to  himself.<br/>
 <br/>
Our *community* is made of a college professors, professional magicians,  <br/>
artists, actors, a theatre owner, a massage therapist, a dietician, several  dog <br/>
breeders, a welder, an advertising exec, college students, a  banker, and a <br/>
private school principal. We&#39;ve sought these folks out because  they&#39;re <br/>
interesting and interested. THEY are our community.<br/>
 <br/>
Cameron&#39;s doing his own community builiding. Many of his newer friends are  <br/>
in their twenties. A few are in their forties. He has a five year old that he  <br/>
spends time with---not paid, but just because they like each other. Most share <br/>
 common interests of music or film-making or travel.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;d say to start hanging out with people with similar interests.<br/>
 <br/>
When your child shows an interest in something new, make an effort to hook  <br/>
up with someone in that field---that person could become a life-long friend. <br/>
Due  to shared interests.<br/>
 <br/>
A neighborhood is VERY different from a community. They could be one in the  <br/>
same, but I bet that&#39;s rare.<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;If you want to marry a doctor, hang out around the medical  school.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Hang out where the interesting folk ARE.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-736390961">I wonder if the term &quot;Community&quot; might sometimes be taken to mean-&quot;the people in your neighborhood&quot;, or  &quot; many of the people in your town&quot;, or   your church.<br/>
Depending on your outlook on life it might mean-   &quot;the supportive members of your family&quot;,  the supportive or like-thinking members of your  neighbourhood, town or church. parents group, park group, childrens activities groups.<br/>
Personally, I don.t think it is of any value for  our kids or family to  spend much time  around non-supportive people or  people  who won&#39;t  mind their own business  about something that I  didn.t initiate into a conversation.<br/>
Of course there always will be people who ask the standard questions. Why arent  you in school today? What grade are you in? <br/>
I think it is my job to &quot;field the flack&quot;<br/>
This often means a bright &quot;we&#39;re so lucky, we homeschool!&quot;<br/>
I don&#39;t let others lead the conversation where I don&#39;t feel like going. ( At least I try , but sometimes stuff comes from where you least expect it-or i am caught off balance)<br/>
For us, right now, (rural lifestyle, family  and I that much prefers few trips to town for general stuff) lots of trips there for the girls chosen activities)<br/>
 Our &quot;supportive&quot; community is my husband and I, other members of the family that don.t buy into home or unschooling but are never the less  kind, non judgmental people at least when we are around.<br/>
It includes  the leaders , instructors, of the groups they are in,  figure skating, dance, our library staff, many of the local store owners who don,t know, don,t care and if they ask are pleasant and mildly or  quite supportive.Parents of the few kids they like to play with , some of whom have teacher parents.<br/>
Our situation differs dramatically from many on the list  but I believe that many of  us as unschoolers  would  feel they  are  get to  decide who the community will be that  we will be part of.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-504952182">Thank you for your responses so far I think I am starting to see <br/>
some alternatives to my current thinking. So could you help me now <br/>
with some ideas on what to say when my kid wants to go next door? I <br/>
will have to work harder to help him make his own community (he is <br/>
only 6 so I don&#39;t think he&#39;s going to meet that many people on his <br/>
own.) and NO I don&#39;t want to move - We have put so much work into <br/>
our house (it&#39;s worth 1 1/2X now what it was when we bought it <br/>
because of our remodeling efforts), this is the first house we&#39;ve <br/>
owned and I don&#39;t want to move just because of the neighbors - many <br/>
of whom are renters anyhow! How do you keep from being depressed by <br/>
the treatment of the children in this world who&#39;s parents treat them <br/>
so poorly? I was an optimist until I got pregnant and I think I have <br/>
been on anxiety/pessimism overload since then, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s some <br/>
natual inbuilt protective mechanism but how can I use it to my <br/>
advantage for my son? <br/>
   I think I will just try to imagine my &quot;community&quot; as the people <br/>
who I can trust to treat me and my son with respect and otherwise <br/>
they are not allowed into that part of our lives, that we will just <br/>
deal with them the best we can, but be cautious of them. I do wish <br/>
there were more unschoolers that lived closer to us. <br/>
    You said &quot;For me, my purpose in life is to treat my kids as well <br/>
as I can, (and I fail lots of times,)&quot;   -  this is a good purpose <br/>
but what happens when the kid grow up? I can&#39;t base the purpose for <br/>
my life on something that at most will probably last about 12 more <br/>
years, I feel the need for a LIFE goal, sure my own kid is a part of <br/>
my goal but not the whole thing - I don&#39;t think my whole life&#39;s <br/>
worth is based on my child although it is a big part of it. Does <br/>
that make sense?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-760103915">Very true, but the relationship does change and become less a part of your<br/>
everyday experience (and theirs) as they grow up and away. Ideally, I think,<br/>
in an unschooling situation we tend to evolve into a friendship with our<br/>
children - with all the respect and equality that implies - a lot faster<br/>
than in &quot;normal&quot; growing situations, however, there still will be a shift<br/>
toward peers, careers, and the child&#39;s new family as they age. It seemed to<br/>
me that the original poster was simply stating that she found that balancing<br/>
this relationship between the self as mother and the individual self early<br/>
on was a healthy choice. <br/>

You said  &quot;For me, my purpose  in life is to treat my kids as well <br/>
as I can, (and I  fail lots of  times,)&quot;   -  this is a good purpose <br/>
but what  happens  when the kid grow up? I can&#39;t base the purpose for <br/>
my life on   something that at most will probably last about 12 more <br/>
years, I feel  the  need for a LIFE goal, sure my own kid is a part of <br/>
my goal but  not the  whole thing - I don&#39;t think my whole life&#39;s <br/>
worth is based  on my child  although it is a big part of it. Does <br/>
that make  sense?   &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Not really. Want to  rephrase?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
It made sense to me.  While raising children, it is worthy and noble  to <br/>
treat them respectfully and as well as possible.  But there is life  after <br/>
children, when they won&#39;t be a part of the day to day.  A mother of  grown children <br/>
shouldn&#39;t sit around waiting for their children to call and come  by so she can <br/>
pursue her &quot;life&#39;s goal&quot;.  Makes for one very unhappy mother,  and would be <br/>
rather guilt producing in the children, don&#39;t you think?<br/>
 <br/>
She needs something else, more overarching than just something that applies  <br/>
to her own children.  Child raising is just a season of  life.  The principle <br/>
of treating children well can and should be  practiced for a lifetime.  But if <br/>
your &quot;entire purpose in life is to treat  your children well&quot;, eventually you <br/>
could be left with no reason to live.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1096354364">***Where is this community that I would trust to help with my child&#39;s<br/>
education??? ***<br/>
<br/>
I think worrying about your neighborhood, town,  and your child&#39;s<br/>
&quot;education&quot; is a lot of worry and you&#39;d feel better if you could relax.<br/>
First, all of us face some of these same issues.  All our kids probably<br/>
get those &quot;why aren&#39;t you in school&quot; questions.   It gets easier.  After<br/>
awhile more people will know you and fewer will ask.  After awhile you&#39;ll<br/>
care less what other people are thinking and saying. <br/>
<br/>
Your son is very young.  Instead of worrying about his education try<br/>
thinking about today.  How is he today?  <br/>
What can you do with him today that he would like?   If your goal is a<br/>
happy today you&#39;ll find facing each day easier. <br/>
<br/>
If your neighbors aren&#39;t particularly nice you don&#39;t have to spend time<br/>
with them.   If you know the lady at the corner store *is* nice, stop in<br/>
there and say hello when you&#39;re going by.<br/>
<br/>
We live in a small town.  There are a few homeschoolers here but they<br/>
stay inside during school hours.   The result of that is that most of the<br/>
people in the community don&#39;t know they know many homeschoolers.  But<br/>
they know us. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
The people at the grocery store know Dylan by name and know he doesn&#39;t go<br/>
to school.  There are no more questions from them about why he&#39;s not is<br/>
school or what he&#39;s studying.   The people at the library, video store,<br/>
variety store, antique store post office, book shop, coffee house and<br/>
green house know he doesn&#39;t go to school.   <br/>
<br/>
When he goes into the library our Librarian talks to him the way she<br/>
talks to everyone.  She tells him about new books by authors he likes. <br/>
She informs him when there are new books about WWII.   She shows him new<br/>
jazz cd&#39;s or new graphic novels.   <br/>
<br/>
When he goes to the book shop they let him into the back room to snoop<br/>
through the used science fiction books they don&#39;t have room for out<br/>
front.  The set aside any old Peanuts books they come across and check to<br/>
see if he wants them.  They don&#39;t ask what he&#39;s learning in school.   <br/>
<br/>
When he goes to the video store they don&#39;t ask me anymore if he&#39;s<br/>
&quot;allowed&quot; to rent this or that movie. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been to the county extension agent so many times over the years<br/>
with different bugs that even after the guy retired he told Dylan to call<br/>
him if he had something interesting.<br/>
<br/>
The vet has called on several occasions to invite Dylan to come see some<br/>
especially unusual critter or condition.  <br/>
<br/>
We go to town meetings.  We go to plays.  We go to concerts and garage<br/>
sales.  And though sometimes someone new asks the same old questions,<br/>
more and more no one&#39;s new and they&#39;re finding other things to talk<br/>
about.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Until an unschooling revolution changes the world we all will have to<br/>
deal with stupid people but the up side of that is once you know who the<br/>
really stupid ones are you can avoid them and go on to the interesting,<br/>
engaging, smart ones. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Deb L<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Children do not need to be made to learn to be better, told what to do<br/>
or shown how. If they are given access to enough of the world, they will<br/>
see clearly enough what things are truly important to themselves and to<br/>
others, and they will make for themselves a better path into that world<br/>
then anyone else could make for them&quot;<br/>

I&#39;m interested in SciFi book recommendations for a 10 year old boy who really likes Harry Potter and Edward Eager and Mercedes Lackey.  He likes the Star Trek TNG novels about when the characters went to school. &lt;g&gt;  (Starfleet Academy)  I&#39;d probably read them aloud, so difficult vocabulary is not a problem.<br/>
<br/>
He liked Ender&#39;s Game, but other than that we haven&#39;t done &quot;adult level&quot; sci fi books.  The only &quot;juvenille&quot; SciFi that leaps to mind is Heinlein, and the science in those is pretty outdated.<br/>

Any ideas?  He really likes books about animals and dragons, so he might really like non-humanoid aliens.  <br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s the Foundation Trilogy by Isaac Asimov. The science will be outdated<br/>
but still interesting. Also the stories in I, Robot (they&#39;re not like the<br/>
movie).<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s Marion Zimmer Bradley - I loved those.<br/>
<br/>
But is the science part important?<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, there&#39;s Bruce Coville&#39;s books which have terrible titles but are<br/>
really fun (&quot;An Alien Ate MY Homework&quot; is one).<br/>
<br/>
Ray Bradbury<br/>
<br/>
Harlan Ellison (some of his stories are a bit grim)<br/>
<br/>
Patricia Wrede has a whole series of dragon books, as does Anne McCaffrey<br/>
(sp?)<br/>
<br/>
All of Tamara Pierce&#39;s books are good - dragons, talking animals,<br/>
medievalish villians and magic.<br/>
<br/>
Douglas Adams<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll keep thinking.<br/>

When  I wrote that:- &quot;for me, etc.... it was in the context of the original post which  I read as  questioning  how  to include her  young child in the local &quot;community&quot; given that she felt it was her lifes interest to  help parents treat their children in better ways. The poster then  included descriptions  of members of her &quot;community&quot; which sounded pretty toxic to me. My reply was based on this being an unschooling list and addressing an approach  that I take with my gg.ds in Community involvement in an unschooling way. <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t dream of replying to a post about someones life  goals, it is of no interest to me other than the unschooling children  aspect. Of course I have other &quot;purposes in life&quot;-being 65 and having raised 5 adult children and an adopted grandaughter and now my great grandaughters-thats 50 years of parenting life.Thats a lot of water under a lot of bridges ;-)<br/>
Sorry if I misunderstood the original focus of the post.<br/>
Grace<br/>
where the girls are now getting &quot;married&quot; again on Harvest Moon and deeply involved...and I&#39;m going to bed to read....actually David Alberts new book-Homeschooling and the voyage of Self Discovery...<br/>
Hmmm maybe I don,t have a real life....oh, right, I have to get up early as I have customers from Seattle arriving  in the morning with their dogs while  they hike in Lake Louise-whewwww--was worried there for a minute.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-341977508">If only it was that easy! I do try and invite the kids over here <br/>
but the kids don&#39;t magically transform once they enter our home - <br/>
they still have a lot of negatives that it is impossible for me to <br/>
even break the &quot;ice&quot; on because they have drilled in &quot;public school <br/>
and do what your parents tell you without question&quot;, and once they <br/>
see how much freedom my son has the situation almost always turns <br/>
abusive!!! And although I try to be as present, supportive and <br/>
explicative as I can it frankly just doesn&#39;t do well for my son to <br/>
have mom constantly butting in when he finally gets a friend over! <br/>
We went through a terrible ordeal with neighbor children stealing <br/>
food this summer - I explained it on one of the lists I frequent but <br/>
I don&#39;t think it was this one. But the kids made excuses to come in <br/>
and then took food and left, usually proclaiming they wanted to play <br/>
with ds but usually just wanting a snack and leaving as soon as they <br/>
secured one - imagine how that made my son feel! I tried to talk <br/>
with him about it and I think towards the end of the summer he <br/>
understood that they weren&#39;t really being his friend when they did <br/>
that, but it still doesn&#39;t make it easier for him to not want to go <br/>
play with them when he sees them playing in their yards. Finally <br/>
what we do now when kids do come over we offer them a snack just <br/>
about as soon as they walk in the door - so if they&#39;re just there <br/>
for the snack then they can take it and go, there&#39;s no need to <br/>
pretend that they want to play. I&#39;m not sure if they cought on to <br/>
that or the fact that they&#39;re now back in school but they haven&#39;t <br/>
been over in about 2 weeks. Anyhow as much as I would love to be <br/>
able to make these kids understand some things I can&#39;t because <br/>
they&#39;re not interested in learning them! And they get this not <br/>
willingness to understand things from their parents because I have <br/>
talked to them as well! Anyhow I am going to try and just find more <br/>
like - minded parents and their kids for my child to play with, to <br/>
be our community, but frankly it&#39;s definately not easy! However I&#39;m <br/>
not going to stop trying to &quot;educate&quot; my neighbors about the child-<br/>
led mentality either, perhaps some may catch on, but until then I am <br/>
going to have my guard up to protect my child! I should also say I <br/>
will be there for my child when he gets hurt because as much as I <br/>
want to protect him, I know when he asks to go to the neighbors and <br/>
even though I&#39;ve explained to him why it may not be the best <br/>
decision, I know he may decide to go and find for himself and <br/>
because I trust him I will let him. <br/>

would read next, because it&#39;s chronologically simultaneous, although it<br/>
wasn&#39;t the one that came out next. It&#39;s also a bit easier to read than<br/>
most of the others.<br/>
<br/>
Asimov is another option. Rain read &quot;I, Robot&quot; right after &quot;Ender&#39;s<br/>
Game&quot;, as I recall. Just don&#39;t think about the &*$% movie.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose Princess Bride (&quot;PB&quot; to our crowd) is more fantasy than scifi,<br/>
but it&#39;s a good read. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1502394042">Thank you for your post! I think I will try to concentrate on <br/>
the &quot;today&quot; aspect you gave. But as for the neighbors it&#39;s kind of <br/>
hard to not somehow spend time with them - whether it&#39;s just them <br/>
dropping by to see if ds wants to go to &quot;church&quot; with them (they <br/>
should really understand by now that we don&#39;t and they have gotten <br/>
my son&#39;s hopes up that they were coming to play with him!URGH! Just <br/>
happened yesturday - I do know I need to relax more - didn&#39;t I just <br/>
write somewhere that when I got pregnant that I went into hyper <br/>
cautious mode and haven&#39;t left it yet!!! &lt;g&gt;) or when they see my ds <br/>
doing something fun in the yard they hop over and insist that they <br/>
be allowed do join, I refuse to hide from them but sometimes I think <br/>
it would be easier, I don&#39;t think they&#39;ve ever asked my son to come <br/>
over to their house and play! Oh well more time that he can spend <br/>
perfecting his latest computer game or wrestling with dad, etc. But <br/>
I think you are right about us concentrating more on the more <br/>
helpful side of our community. Moza<br/>

many years ago, so maybe you should read them yourself first! :-)) <br/>

If only it was that easy! I do try and invite the kids over here <br/>
but the  kids don&#39;t magically transform once they enter our home - <br/>
they still have  a lot of negatives that it is impossible for me to <br/>
even break the &quot;ice&quot; on  because they have drilled in &quot;public school <br/>
and do what your parents tell  you without question&quot;, and once they <br/>
see how much freedom my son has the  situation almost always turns <br/>
abusive!!!  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
My sons have a friend like that.  What I did was to find other  children <br/>
their age that we could meet up with during school hours,  homeschoolers.  So I <br/>
didn&#39;t have to interfere with the other  friendship.  We kept meeting up with <br/>
these same homeschoolers and over time  my boys developed more friendships with <br/>
different children.  That gives  them more choices as far as friends go.  And <br/>
now that they have a wider  range of friendships they have themselves made the <br/>
choice not to see this other  boy again.  They have not verbally said that <br/>
but they choose  the newer friends to do things with and to go visit and to have <br/>
 over.  It has been their choice but a choice made with the information that  <br/>
all people are not the same and they can decide who they want to hang around  <br/>
with.<br/>
 <br/>
Just my thoughts,<br/>
