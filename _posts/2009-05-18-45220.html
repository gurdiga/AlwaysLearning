<div id="ygrps-yiv-406285253">My husband came across this site which is attempting to &quot;make all  <br/>
systematic knowledge immediately computable by anyone.&quot;  It is great  <br/>
for solving math problems anyone may encounter in real life but it  <br/>
also categorizes information on other systematic knowledge in fields  <br/>
like music, chemistry, geography, money/finance.  Sort of makes all  <br/>
that memorization I tried to do in school obsolete.   I thought it was  <br/>
very cool.  Here&#39;s the address.<br/>
