<div id="ygrps-yiv-155506865">O.K so my oldest son is going to be turning 9 tomorrow!! Yea!! But we <br/>
have been noticing new behaviors that I do not know how to respond to. <br/>
He is on the autism spec. very high functioning. So I do realize things <br/>
developmentally will be different, but all of a sudden he is telling us <br/>
to SHUT UP!! and that we are jerks and does not want any help at all <br/>
with anything and screams if he can not do it himself. I am  so ready <br/>
to pull my hair out. <br/>
Now we are unschoolers here in our home and I am also struggling with <br/>
those issues latley for some reason. I guess I am doubting what I <br/>
already know. But it seems that since the weather is so crappy here in <br/>
the northwest now all he wants to do is play video games and he will <br/>
play for 8-12 hours if allowed. Now I am too a gamer too ( world of <br/>
warcraft)but I am having all these issues with it because his behaviour <br/>
has changed since playing the games. I do not know , maybe it is just <br/>
because of his develpomental changes maybe it is just coincidence?  I <br/>
am just so confused sometimes with our unschooling principles. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening,,<br/>

talking to his brother on the headset a lot of the time (Marty in  <br/>
Albuquerque, Kirby in Austin).  I didn&#39;t mind.  There are lots of  <br/>

I used to say &quot;Unschooling is working well for now.  If it stops  <br/>
working, we&#39;ll do something else.&quot;  Instead of having an &quot;educational  <br/>
path,&quot; you could have a flexible stance, and that will give your  <br/>
detractors hope that you&#39;ll change your mind.  Meanwhile, they&#39;ll  <br/>
probably start seeing how cool your kids are. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

instead you could also call it focus, perseverance, dedication,  <br/>
attentiveness.  Help him find things to focus on that he really loves  <br/>
and help expand on those things in little ways. If he&#39;s passionate  <br/>
about tv, think about what he loves most on tv and help him find more  <br/>
of that - is it historical stuff? Slapstick comedy? Word play? People/ <br/>
relationships? And maybe find a way to see a tv show being made. Get a  <br/>
video camera out and see if he wants to make a show. Buy TV Guide and  <br/>
read the articles and talk about them. Oh - read &quot;TV without Pity&quot; -  <br/>
for sure - it is so great for analysis and critical thinking! Does he  <br/>
like the music in a particular show? Download the music and play it in  <br/>
the car while driving somewhere. Does he like particular actors? What  <br/>
else have they been in? Movies? Voices in any animated shows? Watch  <br/>
those.<br/>

If you love something, if you love doing something, if it excites and stimulates and engages you, if it leads you to other things and ideas and people, can it be too much? I have a friend who eats, drinks, breathes, smokes, lives, dances, plays, loves jazz. Everything is jazz. It&#39;s amazing; he&#39;s amazing. I love listening to him tell stories about the music that he heard in Dubai when he and his wife worked there, or the stories about listening and playing in New Haven when he was growing up. He plays trumpet on Wednesday&#39;s in Newcastle. He has made a life out of his love. What is better than that?<br/>
<br/>
When I started graduate school and was talking to my advisor she talked with a little awe about David (my now husband) and the fact that he came knowing what it was he wanted to evolutionary theory to examine. He came to school to explore the thing that interested him, he didn&#39;t use school to define his interests. And it continues. His life and interests focus his research and life and interests and so on and so forth. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a scanner, I tend to bounce from interest to interest. I like that. I enjoy so many things in so many ways. But I totally appreciate the more focused folks in my life. Simon focuses so intensely on things. It is amazing the things that he pulls from his focus that I miss in my scanning. And it leads to knowing so much about so many different things, it&#39;s just a different path or approach.<br/>

with autism.  Schools focus on helping them fit in, when in fact they<br/>
can&#39;t be forced that way.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, it can be a passion, a love, an obsession.  Yes, it can be a career<br/>
path.  Children with autism do obsess on things.  I&#39;ve seen it, I&#39;ve<br/>
known children with autism.  You can either embrace that aspect of your<br/>
child, or worry about it.<br/>
<br/>
It will help a lot to find value in whatever your child is doing,<br/>
especially if it&#39;s something they seem so passionate about.  If the<br/>
focus is on worrying about it, it&#39;s not on your child.  Find a way to<br/>
see what your child loves so much about video games, let that be the<br/>
focus.<br/>

<br/>
 Could it be a carrer path?&gt;&gt;&gt; absolutely!! 5 years ago I admittedly got disgusted with my dh because he was playing games 9 hours a day and said if you love those damn games so much why dont you get a job and make some ! He took me up on that suggestion and graduates with a BA in programming in 4 weeks. <br/>
College isnt the only or even the best path but an example :)<br/>

<br/>
regular children have been know to obsess on things. Aspies get very stressed when what they love is taken away from them. Breathe deeply , talk about maybe a gameboy or nintendo ds as a sort of transitional object to help get him out of the house if you really think he needs to. He can get as much or little social interaction as he chooses and then retreat with the gamboy...it can also be a good &quot;social tool&quot; as most other kids enjoy then and its a topic to talk about. <br/>
<br/>
ps. I have a severaly autistic 7 year old, an aspie 9 year old and an 8 year old aspie godchild so if you want to talk off group feel free to e-mail me <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-807631106">Could you play with him? Does he play on a PC, or on a console that<br/>
you could have multi player games? Do you share interests in the games<br/>
he plays - discussing strategies, what game to buy next, how he feels<br/>

change how you feel about it?<br/>
Do you think its the presence of lots of gaming, or the absence of<br/>
something else that you think might be influencing how he&#39;s behaving?<br/>
My DS is sometimes more inclined to be cranky or frustrated if he<br/>
hasn&#39;t had enough to eat or drink, and if he&#39;s absorbed in<br/>
something(gaming, watching youtube, reading a book, or whatever)<br/>
that&#39;s more likely to happen. I try to help by getting him a drink<br/>
when I make one for myself, sometimes he doesn&#39;t want to break off for<br/>
lunch, so I take a sandwich through to him. Sometimes it helps to<br/>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Hi Kasey,<br/>
<br/>
My aspie kid just turn 8. In my experience, when he is playing a new <br/>
game, it never fail to frustrate and stresses him out becuase the game <br/>
is new, and it challenges him from all angle. From the continous <br/>
trying to get pass the same level over and over again, to making the <br/>
same mistake over and over again. And also not quite knowing what to <br/>
do in each and every new scenario, and new level. <br/>
<br/>
He will bang and throw the controller, scream and cry and shout at the <br/>
tv. It is all just pure frustration that needs to be worked out of his <br/>
system. Tho my kid don&#39;t tell me to shut up, but he will rant that the <br/>
game is stupid, he&#39;s stupid and that nothing i can to can help him. <br/>
Very similar behaviour, isn;t it? <br/>
<br/>
In my experience, DS is just ranting because the emotions is just too <br/>
big and strong inside him. He is not asking for help, and do not WANT <br/>
me to help, because he seriously just wants to work or play out this <br/>
game problem out himself. It&#39;s just that it is SO hard emotionally for <br/>
him. <br/>
<br/>
To how I understand, by me trying to help or talk to him, it&#39;s just <br/>
annoyed him more, because his brain and mind is still in gear, trying <br/>
to figure out the solution to his game, and my &quot;talk&quot; interrupts/ <br/>
distract that. <br/>
<br/>
Plus when I offer suggestions, it is almost like I&#39;m pointing out his <br/>
failure to him, which is like rubbing salt into his wound, which gets <br/>
him even more angrier with himself, of his in-ability to pass that <br/>
level. Which is why he keep saying &quot;you don&#39;t understand! you can&#39;t <br/>
help me, nobody can!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Does this makes sense to you?  Maybe this is why your son&#39;s re-action <br/>
is so strong. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In situations like this, my kid is possessed by the game, day and <br/>
night. It is that challenge, that unless he breaks it, he will never <br/>
feel peace.  I just let him get on with it, supporting by means of <br/>
food and water and sitting down quietly next to him. I can acknowldege <br/>
his frustrations by saying &quot;i know, I know&quot;, and nothing more,  and <br/>
lots of hugs as he rants away. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, after a few exasperated tries, he&#39;ll storm walk, angry with <br/>
himself, crying, and then calm down enough to go check out some online <br/>
FAQs or cheatcodes, and then go back and try again. <br/>
<br/>
But the minute he makes that breakthru, it&#39;s like the most fantastic <br/>
achievement ever for him. He&#39;ll be jumping and whooping and all of the <br/>
sudden, that game is not so hard afterall. And until that happens, <br/>
it&#39;ll be like the hardest struggle ever, literally, for him. <br/>
 <br/>
As for obsessession, this is where I see it best at work. That <br/>
stubborness of refusing to step away for a breather. That narrow <br/>
obsession of wanting to crack that game, at all cost, no matter how <br/>
tired he is. It is this narrow obsession that never allows my child to <br/>
give up, and achieve his victory in the end.   <br/>
<br/>
I have learnt a more positive word for this too. It is called Passion. <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>
<br/>

  Yea!! But we have been noticing new behaviors that I do not know how <br/>

  we are jerks and does not want any help at all with anything and <br/>
  screams if he can not do it himself. but I am having all these issues <br/>

  Hi Kasey,<br/>
<br/>
  My aspie kid just turn 8. In my experience, when he is playing a new <br/>
  game, it never fail to frustrate and stresses him out becuase the game <br/>
  is new, and it challenges him from all angle. From the continous <br/>
  trying to get pass the same level over and over again, to making the <br/>
  same mistake over and over again. And also not quite knowing what to <br/>
  do in each and every new scenario, and new level. <br/>
<br/>
  He will bang and throw the controller, scream and cry and shout at the <br/>
  tv. It is all just pure frustration that needs to be worked out of his <br/>
  system. Tho my kid don&#39;t tell me to shut up, but he will rant that the <br/>
  game is stupid, he&#39;s stupid and that nothing i can to can help him. <br/>
  Very similar behaviour, isn;t it? <br/>
<br/>
  In my experience, DS is just ranting because the emotions is just too <br/>
  big and strong inside him. He is not asking for help, and do not WANT <br/>
  me to help, because he seriously just wants to work or play out this <br/>
  game problem out himself. It&#39;s just that it is SO hard emotionally for <br/>
  him. <br/>
<br/>
  To how I understand, by me trying to help or talk to him, it&#39;s just <br/>
  annoyed him more, because his brain and mind is still in gear, trying <br/>
  to figure out the solution to his game, and my &quot;talk&quot; interrupts/ <br/>
  distract that. <br/>
<br/>
  Plus when I offer suggestions, it is almost like I&#39;m pointing out his <br/>
  failure to him, which is like rubbing salt into his wound, which gets <br/>
  him even more angrier with himself, of his in-ability to pass that <br/>
  level. Which is why he keep saying &quot;you don&#39;t understand! you can&#39;t <br/>
  help me, nobody can!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
  Does this makes sense to you? Maybe this is why your son&#39;s re-action <br/>
  is so strong. <br/>
<br/>
  In situations like this, my kid is possessed by the game, day and <br/>
  night. It is that challenge, that unless he breaks it, he will never <br/>
  feel peace. I just let him get on with it, supporting by means of <br/>
  food and water and sitting down quietly next to him. I can acknowldege <br/>
  his frustrations by saying &quot;i know, I know&quot;, and nothing more, and <br/>
  lots of hugs as he rants away. <br/>
<br/>
  Sometimes, after a few exasperated tries, he&#39;ll storm walk, angry with <br/>
  himself, crying, and then calm down enough to go check out some online <br/>
  FAQs or cheatcodes, and then go back and try again. <br/>
<br/>
  But the minute he makes that breakthru, it&#39;s like the most fantastic <br/>
  achievement ever for him. He&#39;ll be jumping and whooping and all of the <br/>
  sudden, that game is not so hard afterall. And until that happens, <br/>
  it&#39;ll be like the hardest struggle ever, literally, for him. <br/>
<br/>
  As for obsessession, this is where I see it best at work. That <br/>
  stubborness of refusing to step away for a breather. That narrow <br/>
  obsession of wanting to crack that game, at all cost, no matter how <br/>
  tired he is. It is this narrow obsession that never allows my child to <br/>
  give up, and achieve his victory in the end. <br/>
<br/>
  I have learnt a more positive word for this too. It is called Passion. <br/>
<br/>
  Hope this helps.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Please refer to children by name instead of by labels.  If you&#39;re not  <br/>
using names online, say &quot;son&quot; rather than &quot;aspie kid.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

WANT me to help-=-<br/>
<br/>
Because he&#39;s getting bigger and stronger himself, he NEEDS your help-- <br/>
not with the game, but with ideas of how to deal with sudden  <br/>
emotion.  He can put the controller down and then rant, as a first  <br/>
move.  We went through that (and a few controllers) with Kirby.<br/>
<br/>
-=-To how I understand, by me trying to help or talk to him, it&#39;s  <br/>
just annoyed him more, because his brain and mind is still in gear,  <br/>
trying to figure out the solution to his game, and my &quot;talk&quot;  <br/>
interrupts/distract that. -=-<br/>
<br/>
This has nothing to do with Asperger&#39;s.  It&#39;s true of all humans.   <br/>
Once someone is in the throes of frustration and anger, someone else  <br/>
talking about it is likely to escalate it.   When that&#39;s  happening  <br/>
very often in someone&#39;s life, someone on his team, one of his  <br/>
partners, should find a way to help him overcome the problem of not  <br/>
being able to live in the world.<br/>
<br/>
If an adult hasn&#39;t learned to control his or her temper and not throw  <br/>
and break things and yell &quot;stupid&quot; (about things or people), they  <br/>
could end up poor, homeless, or in  jail.<br/>
<br/>
Passion is good, but acquiring tools and knowledge to live with  <br/>
passionate outbursts is crucial to peace and prosperity.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1933557045">-=-I&#39;m a scanner, I tend to bounce from interest to interest. I like  <br/>
that. I enjoy so many things in so many ways. But I totally  <br/>
appreciate the more focused folks in my life. Simon focuses so  <br/>
intensely on things. It is amazing the things that he pulls from his  <br/>
focus that I miss in my scanning. And it leads to knowing so much  <br/>
about so many different things, it&#39;s just a different path or  <br/>
approach.-==<br/>
<br/>
I &quot;leap and linger.&quot;  It&#39;s a phrase used to describe the story arc of  <br/>
a typical traditional ballad.  I know LOTS about traditional ballads,  <br/>
and have managed to tie in poetry, the evolution and variations of  <br/>
English, geography and human migration (which ballads have travelled  <br/>
what routes from NW Europe which parts of other continents?) and some  <br/>
of the  history of &quot;cowboy music&quot; and excuses to play guitar and sing  <br/>
sometimes and I&#39;ve  met people because of our shared interest in  <br/>
traditional and Renaissance music, and it just goes on and on.  And  <br/>
each of those other things (language, guitar, geography, friends)  <br/>
connects to other things.<br/>
<br/>
Whether people have an intense interest or they flit around, it still  <br/>
all leads to everything.<br/>
