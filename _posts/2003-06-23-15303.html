<br/>
It sounds like you have chosen a very interesting lifestyle.  I fell in love<br/>
with donkies when I visited several of the Greek Islands YEARS ago.  I would<br/>
love to have one.  However, we live in the suburbs.  I think it is<br/>
interesting how isolated one can feel even when living in a geographical<br/>
area where there are lots of people.<br/>
<br/>
We have two 6 3/4 year old fraternal twins. One is currently sick and I have<br/>
to get back to her.  She may have strept throat.  They have both been on<br/>
antibiotics once in their lives so far.  I am waiting for the doctor&#39;s<br/>
office to open.  Her stomach hurts, has temp and sore throat at times.  They<br/>
haven&#39;t been sick much and it is always a new/strange experience to have one<br/>
of them sick.    I can&#39;t imagine what it would be like with 4 children.<br/>
<br/>
We also have two geriatric dogs (old english sheepdog and a bichon frise).<br/>
I have spent  a lot of time/$ at vets with both of them.  The bichon was my<br/>
mother&#39;s dog.  They are both l4 years old.  We also have a ragdoll cat that<br/>
my husband found over the computer...she is from California, six years old<br/>
and she came with the name Snow White!<br/>
<br/>
Well...just wanted to say hi.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hey, Jenny.  <br/>
<br/>
How close are you to Fayetteville/Rogers/Springdale?  My parents live in that <br/>
area and they are always pressuring me to move up there.  But I figured if we <br/>
ever did we&#39;d live in OK because of the homeschooling freedom.  <br/>
<br/>
I too live out in the country, about 47 miles east of Memphis.  My husband <br/>
works 50 miles further east, so we decided to share the driving and move from <br/>
Memphis to the halfway point.  People from our unschooling group want to come <br/>
out and see me, but I find it has to be carefully planned and for special <br/>
occasions.  Very few people will come out just to hang out, or more than once or <br/>
twice.  That&#39;s a huge drawback for me.  <br/>
<br/>
I only have one child left in the house, though, so we drive to Memphis a <br/>
lot, almost every day.  He plays baseball in his old league (made the All-Star <br/>
team this week!).  Since during the school year the one kid who lives nearby is <br/>
not available, we work harder at keeping his friendships in Memphis, too.  <br/>
It&#39;s summertime now, though, and he hangs out every day with Charlie, and <br/>
sometimes Charlie&#39;s friends from school.  Luckily for us, none of them have turned <br/>
out to be bullies.  (The first kid we met out here WAS a bully and we promptly <br/>
excised that little wart.)  <br/>
<br/>
Even though we go to Memphis almost every day (it&#39;s baseball season), we seem <br/>
to be more of homebodies than we were living in town.  We have a huge garden, <br/>
like we&#39;ve never had before.  My son has about 20 cantalopes about ready to <br/>
pick.  He gets to fish every day, and he&#39;s learning about growing cotton <br/>
because we live next to a cotton field.  I&#39;m also enjoying something I never thought <br/>
I would, and that&#39;s pulling weeds!  I go out every morning around 7 (it&#39;s too <br/>
hot after that), and sit on a flattened box and go row by row.  It&#39;s like <br/>
meditation. <br/>
<br/>
So in some ways it&#39;s a real drawback to move away from civilization.  But in <br/>
other ways it has changed me a lot.  <br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the list!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1220908323">How close are you to Fayetteville/Rogers/Springdale? <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re about 2 hours from Fayetteville.  We were actually looking at moving to Fayetteville before we moved out here.   There was a possibility of my husband xferring there and I just love the place.  The cost of living is really high though.<br/>
<br/>
Friends is an issue that I have living this far away.  My kids only have one local friend and she&#39;s around in the summer some.  She&#39;s a sweet kid but when she&#39;s here the dynamic is difficult.  <br/>
<br/>
The first year that we lived out here, I had three very dear friends who came out really often.  Last summer, one moved to Costa Rica to attempt a go at an intentional community, one moved home to Oregon and one has been through a brain tumor operation and is just now able to visit us again (since last fall.)  It&#39;s great when she comes because she also has four kids and they all get along marvelously.   My younger three children don&#39;t seem to mind the alone time so much.  My oldest is really missing her friends.  We try and see them as much as we can but it&#39;s tough.  Her favorite friends live 30 min north of Tulsa so that&#39;s an hour and a half for us...but we go when we can...about once every other month maybe.  I get to see my own friends pretty often because I go in to Tulsa twice a month for a mother&#39;s night out with other homeschooling moms.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also amazed at what I&#39;ve found peace in out here.  I love to weed my small garden as well.  I love to water it.  I love to go out every morning and check on all the chickens and our cow and her calf.  I also love to gather up whatever fruits/foods I can find that grow in the &quot;wild&quot; here.  Right now, we&#39;re making nightly excursions at dusk (when it starts to cool down and we can either all go or I can go alone without kids) to gather the most amazing blackberries I&#39;ve ever seen.  We picked last year but I don&#39;t remember them being this big and juicy.  We freeze them and eat them year round and I like to use them in pies, syrup and jam.  We also have mulberries, persimmons,  pecans, a 30 yr. old pear tree that produces enough pears to feed LOTS of families, and a fig tree (the last three planted by my husband&#39;s grandpa.)  I know there&#39;s more here to be found but I haven&#39;t gotten myself educated enough to find it.....yet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1252530582">She may have strept throat.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter went to ps K and the first two months of first grade.  When she started K, she came home one day very ill and had strep throat.  We all got it (5 of us at the time) again and again.  We ended up having it 5 times between November and May. I still think there was a child who was a carrier in her class. This is one of the only times I have used antibiotics and I&#39;d do it again.  It was so hard because we just kept getting it and we were so worn down. We gave it to my mother and sister as well.  It&#39;s the sickest I&#39;ve ever been (except for a nasty case of mastitis.)  I feel for your little girl.  Strep throat can be awful.  Hope she has a speedy recovery.<br/>

Thanks for the suggestions.  I had not really considered this because she&#39;s never been a night owl and I stay out pretty late.  I bet now that she&#39;s almost 11 (on Thursday!!!) she might really enjoy an evening visit with a friend or even her grandma.  <br/>
<br/>
The overnight stuff is tricky because it&#39;s always quite a dilemma about how to get everyone back where they belong the next day.  And, some of our friends aren&#39;t really comfortable with their kids being an hour away for the night and, honestly, I&#39;m not all that thrilled about it either.  At least on my end though, my mother would be close to her.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks again!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-343706051">&lt;&lt;how to bring it up without getting kicked out of the will?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How we handled the situation is to start with homeschool.  I would fill<br/>
grandma in on things the kids were learning.  She appeared to be under the<br/>
assumption that I was teaching this stuff to the kids....so I would say<br/>
&quot;No!! She figured it out on her own!!&quot;  Like I couldn&#39;t believe it.  Then as<br/>
the kids got older about 9, the questions started to come.  Adriane would<br/>
tell people we play all day and don&#39;t &quot;do&quot; school.  So naturally grandma was<br/>
curious.  I explained things to her, offered her some books.  She never read<br/>
them, stating &quot;whatever you guys are doing its working fine.  The kids are<br/>
sharp as tacks.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Big grins from me.<br/>

&gt; Hi!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am new here. I am on a few other homeschool/unschool lists. You guys are<br/>
&gt; great! Really informative, and inspiring. I have a 2 year old son who is<br/>
&gt; going to be unschooled. We have yet to convey this idea to my in-laws who<br/>
&gt; are pretty much against every other parenting idea we have implemented<br/>
&gt; (co-sleeping, breastfeeding, gentle parenting, etc.). My mil thinks that<br/>
&gt; all children need &quot;training&quot;. She once said &quot;Children are god&#39;s way of<br/>
&gt; punishing you for enjoying sex.&quot; Any ideas about how to bring up the idea<br/>
&gt; without getting kicked out of the will? &lt;g&gt; I was thinking of<br/>
&gt; articles/statistics...any good ones? Books are too much - I need some<br/>
&gt; fairly quick come-backs. I was thinking of bringing up homeschooling first<br/>
&gt; and not even broaching the idea of unschooling until I see how it settles.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks a lot!<br/>

<br/>
My mother in law came to visit when Kirby was a week old.  I asked her if she <br/>
wanted to change his diaper to be what I thought was generous and friendly.  <br/>
I like to change other people&#39;s babies diapers.  It&#39;s an intimate  &quot;see the <br/>
whole thing,&quot; make the baby feel better, yada yada.  Usually people just get to <br/>
keep the baby away from its mom, but changing them is doing them a favor.    <br/>
<br/>
Also she was an nurse and a mom, so I thought she&#39;d have a particular <br/>
interest in seeing how he was compared to her own kids.  <br/>
<br/>
She looked at me kind of funny and said &quot;I guess so.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it was a mistake and maybe not, looking back at it from 17 years.  But <br/>
when she came back out she said this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You have to get him circumcised.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We decided not to.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She recited some 1940&#39;s stuff and I recited some 1980&#39;s stuff, and asked her <br/>
if she wanted to read some of what we read to decide.  She did the derisive <br/>
laugh/snort she does to preface something semi-neutral when she really wants it <br/>
to be a put-down and said &quot;Well I&#39;ll read it, but it won&#39;t change my mind.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They were staying in their camper in the mountains.  I gave her three books <br/>
(maybe four) with a sticky note on the best anti-circumcision page of each and <br/>
she took them.<br/>
<br/>
The next day when she showed up she set the three books very gently on the <br/>
table in the same place they had been, and said *GENTLY* &quot;Well, things have <br/>
changed a lot since I was in nursing school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When we decided to keep him home instead of kindergarten, we had contingency <br/>
plans.  It wasn&#39;t a life commitment, it was a &quot;keep him home this year and <br/>
see.&quot;  When she questioned it, I asked if she wanted to read what we read, and <br/>
she (snortlessly) declined.<br/>
<br/>
Just this year (early 2003) we got a routine letter from my husband&#39;s <br/>
parents.  At that time we&#39;d been homeschooling most of 12 years, with three kids.  <br/>
For the first time, she said we were doing a good job homeschooling and our kids <br/>
were thriving.  (Not the exact quote, but it was good to have something <br/>
positive, even though it took twelve years.)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;She once said &quot;Children are god&#39;s way of <br/>
punishing you for enjoying sex.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What a weird attitude!  Your poor husband, growing up feeling that he was the <br/>
growing wrath of God (if he knew she thought that).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Any ideas about how to bring up the idea <br/>
without getting kicked out of the will? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Just don&#39;t bother.  Just say &quot;homeschooling&quot; and don&#39;t talk about methods <br/>
until you have to, and then say &quot;individualized&quot; until you have to say different.<br/>
<br/>
There was just a letter that someone wrote to his friend.  On the forum, I <br/>
think, at www.unschooling.com, was it?   And Kelly Lovejoy&#39;s husband wrote one <br/>
to his mom a while back.  Maybe those letters should be put where others can <br/>
find them to use them to mine parts.  <br/>
<br/>
But with a very small child, just say as little as possible.  The best <br/>
stories to tell her are the learning stories.  Enough of those build up and it will <br/>
be easy to move into saying &quot;He&#39;s learning so much and so well, I don&#39;t want <br/>
to put him in school where his rhythm will be messed up.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And it ALWAYS helps to say &quot;We&#39;re going to do this until it isn&#39;t working <br/>
anymore.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who says &quot;He&#39;ll only see the inside of a school over my dead body&quot; is <br/>
just asking for parental trouble, because they do have a biological and legal <br/>
relationship with that child and so &quot;Do you want to read what we read to <br/>
decide?&quot; is way better than any form of &quot;screw you,&quot; no matter how disguised it is.<br/>
<br/>
And if you say &quot;If you want to read this [specific stuff], we could discuss <br/>
it&quot; puts the next move on them.  If they don&#39;t want to read that stuff, you <br/>
don&#39;t have to discuss it.<br/>

Keith&#39;s parents have money.  They spent a lot of it travelling after they <br/>
retired, but they still have money.  I was resigned to not getting any if they <br/>
got pissed off.<br/>
<br/>
If we&#39;re going to raise our children on the hope of being paid later for <br/>
doing it someone else&#39;s way, our priorities are going to bite us in the ass.  Some <br/>
people with money end up using all of it in the end on a nursing home and a <br/>
cataclysmic kind of injury or illness.<br/>
<br/>
If you raise the kids the way you honestly think is best, be tactful with <br/>
your inlaws, tell them good and happy stories about what the kids are learning, <br/>
and remain as pure-hearted as you can, let the chips fall where they may.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Maybe you could just remind her that any distress caused by any of your <br/>
alternative parenting choices is just &#39;punishment&#39; for her having enjoyed sex <br/>
with your fil. &lt;eg&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
OOOH!  OOOH!!  GOOD ONE!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Or maybe they&#39;ll have other grandchildren and need less vicarious <br/>
gratification from your child/ren. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We thought we would have the first and only grandchildren.  Keith&#39;s brother <br/>
had been married twelve years or more and no kids.  Keith and I had been <br/>
together for six years and married for two before Kirby came, but just before that <br/>
the older brother had one.  The middle brother never has.<br/>
<br/>
So the older brother had two, about Kirby and Marty&#39;s ages.  <br/>
<br/>
It made it hard at first, because Travis and Curtis wore suits for their <br/>
photos, Travis and Curtis went to church every Sunday, Travis and Curtis had <br/>
report cards and sports stories.  Travis and Curtis lived in a fancy house in <br/>
Hannahan, South Carolina.  Travis and Curtis said &quot;Yes Sir&quot; and &quot;Yes Ma&#39;am.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You can all guess, I&#39;m sure. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Travis and Curtis ended up hating school, hating their parents, refusing to <br/>
visit their grandparents, being thrown off sports teams or forbidden by their <br/>
dad, so they hated him worse.  Travis and Curtis are surly and sneaky (Travis <br/>
is, I don&#39;t know about Curtis) and in their adversarial relationship, his dad <br/>
refused to pay for the Baptist college he wanted to go to, and said state <br/>
college or get out of the house (or pay rent).<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, our kids slowly grew into actual respect, honest good eye-contact <br/>
and real conversations with their grandparents.  <br/>
<br/>
Huh. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

last week. He has a knack for cornering me on issues when DH is not <br/>
around. He never, ever brings these things up in his presence. It&#39;s <br/>
been ongoing for the past five years, with varying topics like <br/>
breastfeeding, co-sleeping, homebirthing and now has moved on to <br/>
homeschooling. One morning we were sitting in the kitchen and he hits <br/>
me with &quot;So, are you EVER going to send the kids to school?&quot; A thirty <br/>
minute discussion ensued with the typical argument of socialization <br/>
being the main issue. I wish I would have said it right off the bat, <br/>
but after being worn down I finally told him that I would be happy to <br/>
gather some things for him to read. He told me that there was no way <br/>
that he would read them and not to bother and that for every article <br/>
that I could come up with, he was sure that he could produce <br/>
something to the contrary. I let him know that I was done discussing <br/>
this if he wasn&#39;t interested in learning more about what helped us <br/>
come to this decision. <br/>
<br/>
I guess my point was that I have heard of people using this tactic <br/>
before, and I am so thrilled that I finally remembered to use it. It <br/>
certainly ended the discussion and my feeling that I needed to defend <br/>
myself and I have confidence that in the future that when this comes <br/>
up, I have the choice to not discuss it :)<br/>

Thank you all for your great suggestions. I have been doing the avoidance, <br/>
change the subject, walk out of the room  - I have put up with her for 9 <br/>
years now. I have never been accepted because I am so far from her point of <br/>
view, walk of life, etc. FIL is much nicer, has mellowed out over the <br/>
years, and really enjoys Liam. He is pretty reasonable, but will need some <br/>
reassurance. I think I will not bring up the idea of unschooling and just <br/>
stick to homeschooling...too much for them to take.<br/>

Flora, I wasn&#39;t taking the will thing seriously...I knew you weren&#39;t. :)  <br/>
Mostly, I think your mil is a lot like my ex-mil, and there probably isn&#39;t much <br/>
you can do. It has nothing to do with you... she&#39;s just a very unhappy, <br/>
negative person. I would avoid it until she starts asking about school, then tell her <br/>
the two of you have decided to homeschool. (If your husband is up with it, <br/>
make HIM be the passionate, unrestrained advocate for it. Then YOU can say the <br/>
stuff about &quot;we&#39;ll do it as long as it seems to be working.&quot;) <br/>
<br/>
If she still questions it, you could tell her the sex was REALLY good and you <br/>
figure you really deserve punishment. Otherwise you&#39;re going to end up with <br/>
dozens of kids. heehee<br/>

If your mil brings up socialization you could talk about the importance <br/>

it&#39;s true) talk about what you think is valuable that your kids get out <br/>

kids would see her less if they are in school.  (Even if she is a big <br/>
pain, surely she has at least one interesting interest to share with <br/>
them, or some good family stories to impart?)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if your mil is tolerable, but my mil is sweet.  Although <br/>
many teachers are kind and sincerely interested in kids, on average I&#39;d <br/>
value a relationship with a nearby grandparent over a relationship with <br/>
a teacher.<br/>

the dictionary definitions:<br/>
<br/>
1.  To place under government or group ownership or control.<br/>
2.  To make fit for companionship with others; make sociable.<br/>
3.  To convert or adapt to the needs of society.<br/>
(American Heritage)<br/>
<br/>
What normal humans mean is &quot;How will she find friends if they&#39;re all in<br/>
school and she&#39;s not?&quot;  The answer to that (be sure to clarify the<br/>
question), is park day, homeschool support groups, group classes for music,<br/>
theater, sports, horseback riding, dog training, whatever the child is<br/>
interested in.  You could also point out that many schools no longer permit<br/>
recess, so kids have no time to &quot;socialize&quot; in the conventional sense.<br/>

As it happened, we went to a Holloween party last night. Lyndsey (almost 3) spent a <br/>
good 15 min talking with one of the band members. She came back to our table bubbling <br/>
over about her new found friend who talked to her about holloween, playing in a band <br/>
and eating lots of candy. Then she happily played with a 1 yr old who was learning to <br/>
walk. All in all she was a social butterfly.<br/>

 <br/>
my name is maria, im a 25 yo mama of 2. a 5yo and a 3yo. i have decided in the last few months that keeping my kids home and continueing on with life as usual just makes sense for us. i am now looking into my state regulations on hsing,  reading websites and books (teach your own, i was so sad that i didnt even know of this thoughtful amazing man until after he passed)and feeling around for other unschoolers in my area or online. i am recieving alot of critisisim, and lack of understanding from family... but i am a strong stubborn woman :) and i am SO EXCITED to read more and more about what just make sense to me. <br/>
anyhow, i look forward to reading your posts!<br/>
<br/>
