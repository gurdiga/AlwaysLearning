<div id="ygrps-yiv-9660456">I posted this on the big list (which is mysteriously dry lately), but wanted <br/>
to ask the best folks too (and there are a fair number here who aren&#39;t on <br/>
unschooling-dotcom).<br/>
<br/>
If you purchased or will receive for Christmas the boxed set of the extended <br/>
version of The Fellowship of the Ring (with the bookends), IF you do not have <br/>
gaming-children, Kirby begs me to beg you to let him have the few collectible <br/>
cards that come with that.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t know about the playing cards when I opted for the four-DVD set <br/>
without frills.  He&#39;s greatly troubled about that, and asked me please to ask <br/>
my homeschooling friends who might have just lost the cards, given them to <br/>
young children who don&#39;t need them, or used them for bookmarks or some such.<br/>
<br/>
We could trade other card-stuff, or negotiate for some compensation to those <br/>
who might be willing to part with the cards.<br/>
<br/>
And he wouldn&#39;t mind having more than one set if that&#39;s a possibility.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s getting involved in playing that game, his main interest is Faramir, and <br/>
apparently the cards in that set are unavailable otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

those emails really saved my sanity in the first few weeks of my recovery.<br/>
