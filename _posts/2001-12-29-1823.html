<div id="ygrps-yiv-652847496"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Jurassic Park is another great film.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Has anyone read the JP books recently? I read JP and The Lost World years <br/>
ago. I remember that there was a page towards the end of The Lost World that <br/>
really struck me. It seemed to me that the entire book, the entire problem <br/>
with those damn attacking dinos, was boiling down to the older generation <br/>
not being there to care for the younger generation. I remember, at the time, <br/>
feeling that it had a strong daycare implication. (Now I&#39;d throw in <br/>
schooling vs. actually *being* with your children as well.)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have the books here to find that page. Anyone else remember it?<br/>
