Hi Marina your post was right on about children sharing with  <br/>
strangers. I think a lot of parents expect children to share with  <br/>
other children that they barely know and I think children are  <br/>
protective over their things and do not know the other child well  <br/>
enough to know if they are going treat their toy nicely. I know with  <br/>
my girls when I come across the sharing situation I ask them if they  <br/>
have a toy that they wouldn&#39;t mind playing with and if they do can  <br/>
they go and get it for them. I know with myself I am weary when  <br/>
someone new comes into my house and touches things that I are valuable  <br/>
to me because I really do not know the person. I try to prepare my  <br/>
children when someone new is coming over and ask them if they want to  <br/>
put up the things that they do not want others to play with.<br/>
<br/>
And I agree if it is done with tears it is not sharing. If the  <br/>
children are young then maybe have a variety of toys out and put up  <br/>
the one that you know your child values over the other toys.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; If I offer to let someone take my guitar home for a while that&#39;s my<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; choice. If someone asked if they could take my guitar home, they&#39;d<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; better be my REALLY good friend.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I noticed my children readily shared most of the time with friends, and<br/>
almost always with me, whether I asked them to share with me or not!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, my question now is how does a child learn about sharing?<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Little by little in lots of different ways. By you sharing with her.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; By being generous with what you have. By helping her feel she has<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;enough&quot;. The reason to hold onto something is because you fear you<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; won&#39;t get more. It&#39;s far easier to share when you feel you have more<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; than enough. It&#39;s a rare child who won&#39;t share something that&#39;s<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; essentially endless like water or paper ;-) It&#39;s only when there&#39;s a<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; feel of rationing that people feel they need to hold onto what they<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; have<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have always shared with my kids, and so they reciprocate.  But even if<br/>
they have enough children need not share with everyone all the time.   <br/>
It is<br/>
much easier to share with people whom you have a relationship with, so I<br/>
think most children might be willing to give their friend a turn or a  <br/>
piece<br/>
more often than a stranger :-)<br/>
<br/>
Many parents ask their children to sacrifice toys, or treats to  <br/>
strangers.<br/>
While that makes them &quot;the popular parent&quot; with the neighbours, I would<br/>
guess the child might feel resentful and angry at being bullied into  <br/>
making<br/>
sacrifices.  Sharing is one instance where adults demand much more of<br/>
children than of themselves!  It really demonstrates how disempowered<br/>
children are in our world!<br/>
<br/>
Also, note that if your child surrenders something to someone while in  <br/>
tears<br/>
or has a meltdown that is not sharing.  If someone asks me at gunpoint  <br/>
to<br/>
share my wallet, I will hand it over, but I would not call it  <br/>
sharing.  I<br/>
would call it theft!  I would never want to invite the thief to  <br/>
dinner, nor<br/>
would I be willing to shake hands and wish him well.<br/>
