Greetings fellow unschoolers!<br/>
<br/>
I am pleased to be working with Blake Boles and Abbi Miller on their newest<br/>
project, UNSCHOOL ADVENTURES!<br/>
<br/>
UA offers innovative international and domestic trips for teenage unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
We are excited to announce that we are currently enrolling students for two<br/>
upcoming trips this year:<br/>
<br/>
The NOVEL-WRITING RETREAT on the Oregon coast (near Seaside): Oct 31 - Dec 1,<br/>
2009<br/>
<br/>
The AUSTRALIA trip: Dec 31, 2009 - Feb 12, 2010<br/>
<br/>
After the wild success of our 6-week ARGENTINA trip last year, we are pleased to<br/>
offer more incredible adventures to the teen unschooling community!<br/>
<br/>
Please visit our website, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unschooladventures.com">http://www.unschooladventures.com</a> to learn more. <br/>
Alternatively you may write to Blake or Abbi at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:unschool.adventures@...">unschool.adventures@...</a> with any<br/>
questions.<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to pass this information along to any unschooled teens and families<br/>
that may be interested!<br/>

Thanks!<br/>
