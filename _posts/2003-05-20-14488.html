she WANTS to! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

Kathryn Baptista has stepped up to host the 2004 Live & Learn Unschooling <br/>
Conference. She&#39;s (probably out of her mind!) working on location and <br/>
speakers now.<br/>
<br/>
I would be THRILLED to see it &quot;wander&quot; the country for a few years. Maybe in <br/>
the midwest (St Lou?OH?) in 2005, then in the west (OR?) somewhere in 2006. <br/>
Midsouth (NM?TX?OKLA??) in 2006. And back to me in 2007. That way anyone who <br/>
wanted to could go anytime, but it could move around and make it more <br/>
affordable and more accessible for more people.<br/>
<br/>
Any takers? I&#39;m MORE than happy to walk someone through it step-by-step.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m figuring it would be bigger each time---and just plain easier.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>About the time you started talking about the last one, I was talking with my <br/>
friends in Little Rock about doing one there.  We had Sandra commited...and <br/>
our support group is called Live & Learn.  But it didn&#39;t gel.  I wasn&#39;t <br/>
actually living in Little Rock then, but I think if I had been, it would have <br/>
come off.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe someday we&#39;ll have it in Little Rock.  <br/>

<br/>
~Kelly, ducking and running! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

New Mexico is just so...  little.<br/>
I mean for local infrastructure.  But that&#39;s what convention-experienced <br/>
hotels are for, right?<br/>

    I know you were kidding but I think I will toss it around a few people<br/>
here and see what happens. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
    I really hope it&#39;s a go for Kathryn. I&#39;d love to see that part of the<br/>
country too. It a wonderful excuse for a trip.&lt;G&gt;<br/>

Barb E<br/>
&quot;Youth is not a time of life; it is a state of mind; it is<br/>
not a matter of rosy cheeks, red lips and supple knees; it<br/>
is a matter of the will, quality of the imagination, a<br/>
vigor of the emotions; it is the freshness of the deep<br/>
springs of life. &quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1762975595">I think this whole &quot;around the country&quot; thing sounds great!!   That way we<br/>
can see different parts each year!   Boston next year?  Cool!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the 2005 one will be mine..Fargo maybe?   Maybe I&#39;ll get attendees<br/>
just out of curiousity for the city.  Is it as wierd as the movie?<br/>
Unless Ohio is a go.        I know we&#39;ll just plan our vacations around<br/>
those locations.<br/>
