<div id="ygrps-yiv-323605286">Hello!<br/>
My name is Angela and I have a question for this group:<br/>
Has anyone saw the TV movie series Game of Thrones in family?<br/>
I have a 15 and 11 years old boy and girl and I don&#39;t know if it is right to watch with them those movies. My concerns are about sex scene. Can be to much for them?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1532505526"><html><head></head>My husband and I love the series, but the sex is very heavy in the first few seasons. We tried to watch from the beginning with the kids, but stopped because we forgot how graphic it was. My adult son has read the books and shared them with our 15yo. He said it doesn’t stand out as much in them? We may watch it together at some point and just fast forward through some of it, lol.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Sadie Bugni<br><br><div id="ygrps-yiv-1532505526AppleMailSignature" dir="ltr">Sent from my iPhone</div><div dir="ltr"><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> On Oct 19, 2018, at 1:36 PM, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:angelazgulea@...">angelazgulea@...</a> [AlwaysLearning] &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br><br></span></blockquote></div><blockquote type="cite"><div dir="ltr">

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1066900664"><div><div>I love Game of Thrones. The show is very explicit, both sexually (nudity, allusions to rape) as well as war, fighting, some torture, and outright butchery. Though I have seen them all, when I re-watch, I will skip certain and scenes. I don’t need to see them again. </div></div><div><br></div><div>It depends on the individual. My husband read the books and loved them, but after episode 1, he won’t watch the others. Too graphic and it stays with him. </div><div><br></div><div>My kids have not shown an interest, but I think 11 is pretty young for this. Again- depends on the individual and their sensitivity- but I would prob put my 12 year old off for a couple</div><div> Years, or watch after having prescreened so I can warn of the especially rough parts. I did this with sister in law who is very sensitive to abuse and violence toward animals. </div><div><br></div><div>If you are concerned about the sex, then simply watching the first episode will give you a clue. It gets more explicit from there- </div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> <div class="ygrps-yiv-1066900664gmail_quote"><div dir="ltr">On Sat, Oct 20, 2018 at 1:10 PM <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:angelazgulea@...">angelazgulea@...</a> [AlwaysLearning] &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br></div><blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-1066900664gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;">
