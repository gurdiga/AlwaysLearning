I found that quote on the Procovery site.  I had gone to find the  <br/>
current URL of their use of my Certificate of Empowerment.<br/>
<br/>
I had gone to get that URL because today, March 23, 2006, is the  <br/>
tenth anniversary of that certificate.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/blog">http://sandradodd.com/blog</a><br/>

&gt; ==============<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>:)  Oh I like that this is an artist quote.  The fun approach to the<br/>
unknown.    <br/>
<br/>
Picasso was criticized for dabbling in many styles of art.  He managed<br/>
not to be pigeonholed and did a lot of cool stuff along the way.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with a friend who said there&#39;s not much academic in art.  She<br/>
said art is often used for credit and advancement, but it&#39;s really<br/>
about life-- not academic purposes that can use, misuse, abuse,<br/>
minimize, break down, and belittle.  Some people go so far as to say<br/>
that art IS life.  They flow and swirl, and don&#39;t depend on perfect<br/>
approaches.  Life, art and things like that are very forgiving, and<br/>
steps are only necessary if you want or need them to be to be there. <br/>
You could edge in toe-wise, move in a bit at a time, or dive in.  <br/>
<br/>
I think that goes for unschooling too.<br/>

read &quot;stir for eight years&quot;!<br/>
<br/>
But when you think about it, the cake (the unschooled kids) are never <br/>
going to be as unschooled as they could have been if mother hadn&#39;t <br/>
stirred (eased into) unschooling over a period of 6 - 8 years. Like I <br/>
have, sadly. My kids are great, but they will always have residual <br/>
damage from all that stirring - the cake never rises so well if you stir <br/>
for too long.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1487583803">Well yes.  I agree.  Don&#39;t wait.  You might do better to have your art<br/>
supplies right there and the canvas primed before painting.  But<br/>
sometimes it doesn&#39;t work out that way and you dive in even if you get<br/>
different results than you&#39;re used to.  Discover new things.  You very<br/>
well could end up with cake in the oven without eggs.  And it would be<br/>
fine even if you don&#39;t call it cake.  You don&#39;t have to have<br/>
everything perfect, especially if the kids are in school.  <br/>
<br/>
Sticking a toe in is not waiting six months or a year.  I&#39;ve been in<br/>
the waiting stage for a couple years (painful counterproductive years)<br/>
and am only just starting to live unschooling.  It *feels* like I&#39;m<br/>
diving in but maybe that&#39;s just my toe.  Hard to know which.    <br/>
<br/>
I thought since ds is only 2 1/2 we couldn&#39;t seriously be unschooling<br/>
until closer to when he&#39;s 4 or so.  He deschooled the idea of<br/>
kindergarten age out of me.  Ds is on the move.  He doesn&#39;t wait for<br/>
anything.  So I decided it would be so much easier to continue the way<br/>
we mean to go now instead of allowing baggage to become firmly<br/>
entrenched and stay a while unheeded just to be shucked later.  Why do<br/>
that when we&#39;ve been laying a beautiful basis of attachment parenting<br/>
up til now?  We&#39;ve got a nice start.  I would think we could just keep<br/>
on going, and not listen to stupid things like &quot;you&#39;re babying him.&quot; <br/>
He&#39;s so *not* babyish and I love &quot;pandering&quot; to him.<br/>
