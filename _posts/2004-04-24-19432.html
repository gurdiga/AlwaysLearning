<br/>
Great!  Then please don&#39;t automatically assume what people are writing to<br/>
you is meant to be mean spirited and useless.    Assume instead it&#39;s<br/>
meant in the gentlest possible way and posted because they hope you might<br/>
be helped by it.  Assume they care.  <br/>
<br/>
Can you tell us some things your son loves?  <br/>
Which are is favorite Japanese comics? <br/>
What kinds of books does he like?  Science fiction?  History? <br/>
What kinds of games does he like to play?<br/>
What are his favorite TV shows?  His favorite movies? <br/>
Does he like to go for walks?<br/>
Does he like to go boating?  Ride his bike?<br/>
Does he like to cook? <br/>
Would he like to chat on-line with other kids? <br/>
When he&#39;s with his friend, what do they talk about and do?<br/>
<br/>
If you give us some information about the things he loves, maybe we can<br/>
brainstorm ways to translate those things into activities where he might<br/>
meet other people who share his passions. <br/>
<br/>
Also, until he has friends to do things with, you can do things with him.<br/>
 You can be his companion in reading and drawing and play.  Ask him to<br/>
show you how to draw Japanese style animated characters.  Ask him if you<br/>
can read with him, or to him.  Take him places and have fun.   Kids don&#39;t<br/>
need kids in order to be doing fun things, they just need someone fun. <br/>
Jump on the trampoline with him.  Play Frisbee, lay out in the grass and<br/>
watch the stars.  Give him the best from a happy companion and he&#39;ll feel<br/>
happier.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1475491123">One of the things we have found that helps kids  develop a special friendship is to  invite  someone  along as a special  outing.<br/>
We have found that something like a picnic, weiner roast-even in your own backyard although we go to a variety   of creeks, natural areas.  A place where the parents can relax and do the food or go along on exploring walks;  and the kids can wade, explore etc.  and play works better for us that  a place full of other people or  events . The kids then get to remember together say &quot;hey, remember that cool place we found on the picnic that was  like a cave&quot; or ?.<br/>
Talking to the kids and then making phone calls to the parents first helps  settle all the worries like-will it be safe, will you be there at all times. what time will you be back. what do your kids like to eat-do they have any allergies.&quot;<br/>
Going to an event with an other child hasnt always worked well as the friends get caught up in that and not in having fun with your child  and family. Also inviting the friends brother or sister can work well  as the friend wont feel so isolated and   often  they are used to going places together anyway.<br/>
There are no other children in our immediate rural area and no homeschoolers anywhere around. Having a group of Unschoolers around would be  incredible. <br/>
