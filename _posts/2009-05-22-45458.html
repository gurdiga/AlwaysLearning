<div id="ygrps-yiv-1035772949">Lee Stranahan who interviewed me and put up two videos on YouTube (two  <br/>
so far) also talked to Holly that day (and to both of us the week  <br/>
after, but that might be for a different project).<br/>
<br/>
Two of the comments there are friendly and positive but they highlight  <br/>
the differences between what we&#39;re going and what it looks like we&#39;re  <br/>
doing.   If I commented to these people out in public, it would seem  <br/>
like a quibble over nothing, but here on this list I think people  <br/>
begin to see the differences, so I&#39;ll comment here!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-You can always go to college later. Take some time to travel. Your  <br/>
mother taught you to make the world your classroom, take advantage of  <br/>
that. Go back packing in Europe or South America.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s been to Europe.  She&#39;s choosing among cool options right now.   <br/>
She turned down a request to go to England and Wales with me.  Her  <br/>
life is full and rich.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I didn&#39;t &quot;teach her to make the world her classroom.&quot;   But  <br/>
still, the comment was intended to be positive and encouraging.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-Home schooling is only good when you have good parents. Reg school  <br/>
is only good when you have good schools. To each his own but you  <br/>
should go to college if you can. If nothing more than the experience  <br/>
it is well worth your time.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Even the best of schools have many unhappy kids in them.   And that  <br/>
last line on &quot;the experience is well worth your time&quot; about college is  <br/>
interesting.   If it were a free experience that might be very valid,  <br/>
but many kids are using college as they only way they know of to  <br/>
escape the bonds of their parents&#39; homes, and the use it as a go-crazy  <br/>
place and time.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Holly ended up in college at some point  <br/>
because of her interest in memory and dreams and cognition.   But I  <br/>
woudln&#39;t be surprised if she didn&#39;t, either.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the video is here.  It&#39;s just two minutes and forty seconds:<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Even if it was free (and the community colleges here are darn cheap), <br/>
the real cost would be what is given up by putting their time and energy <br/>
into it. These unschooled kids take their own lives seriously and <br/>
haven&#39;t been brainwashed into thinking that nothing is more important <br/>
than school. That doesn&#39;t stop when they are young adults - they don&#39;t <br/>
see college as the entire point of their lives, like so many kids right <br/>
out of high school do.<br/>
<br/>
Roya liked college a lot - she got into it early and got involved in <br/>
campus activities - that suited her really well. She was in a small <br/>
vocal ensemble, involved in the ceramics lab, on the speech and debate <br/>
team, and so on. Then, when she transferred to a 4-year college, she <br/>
majored in &quot;Recreation and Leisure Studies&quot; and took classes in things <br/>
like, &quot;The Universality of Play&quot; and the attitude of all her professors <br/>
was that the best learning happens in what people think of as <br/>
recreational activities. All perfect for her.<br/>
<br/>
Roxana is an intellectual and academic type of person - she LOVES it. <br/>
She takes history and literature and anthropology classes for the fun of <br/>
it - she&#39;s a drama major - those classes are all &#39;extra&#39;. If she doesn&#39;t <br/>
make it as a musical theater performer, she&#39;ll be an academic - probably <br/>
get a PhD. She loves college. (Doesn&#39;t always love the idiotic way <br/>
things are run, the sadistic or incompetent teachers, etc, but the <br/>
overall experience is what she loves - the academic way of life is <br/>
perfect for her.<br/>
<br/>
Rosie didn&#39;t think she&#39;d want to go to college - figured she&#39;d do <br/>
something else like run her own karate studio, eventually. She&#39;s a very <br/>
physical person - plays soccer, has a black belt and teaches martial <br/>
arts, dances, etc. She&#39;s 18. But she&#39;s been taking musical theater and <br/>
some other fun classes at the community college and finally was able to <br/>
get into an American Sign Language class - and she&#39;s super good at it <br/>
and loves it. So then she investigated how to pursue interpreting as a <br/>
career and discovered a 4-year university near us is the top one in the <br/>
west for Deaf Studies. Just yesterday she met with an adviser from that <br/>
university and she&#39;s planning to go there in a couple of years - she&#39;s <br/>
ALL excited. It is an awesome program and she&#39;d be living on campus with <br/>
Deaf roommates and getting lots of interpreting experience. So - now <br/>
she&#39;s got that goal and has figured out everything she needs to do to <br/>
get there.<br/>
<br/>
However, an interesting thing came up as she was planning her next <br/>
couple of years. Turns out that all the interpreting courses are offered <br/>
only in the evenings. But she plays soccer two nights a week and teaches <br/>
karate two nights a week and does not want to give those up. She decided <br/>
she could spread out her plans to take a little longer to get to the <br/>
university - take fewer classes this year and stick with her martial <br/>
arts and soccer for one more year. She&#39;s not in a hurry. The adviser <br/>
from the school was ALL about how she could get there and get through <br/>
the program as quickly as possible - Rosie was having trouble figuring <br/>
out what the hurry was. So the adviser gave her  a plan in which she <br/>
could start going there in fall 2010 (not this fall, but the next) and <br/>
Rosie was thinking more of taking her time and getting there in 2012. <br/>
The adviser seemed to think she should just completely and totally <br/>
&quot;focus on school&quot; as if nothing else in her life mattered. Rosie came <br/>
out of the meeting with the adviser and refigured all the course plans <br/>
so that she could fit in the other things that are important to her <br/>
(including her family life and her boyfriend and social activities like <br/>
regular game playing).<br/>
<br/>
So - I&#39;ve spent my kids lifetimes saying, &quot;College can be cool, but <br/>
better to only go if you really want to.&quot; I&#39;ve often, very very often, <br/>
talked about how awful it is  for the students who are there because <br/>
their parents say they can only live at home if they stay in school. <br/>
I&#39;ve often talked about how awful it is for those kids who drift into <br/>
college without having a clue why they are there - just not knowing what <br/>
else to do with themselves. I&#39;ve talked about how they are picking <br/>
college majors based on liking the teacher of a particular class without <br/>
any sense of wanting to pursue a personal passion. I&#39;ve been negative, <br/>
more often than not, about college because the vast majority of the <br/>
students I have really should not, imo, be there. And I have a family <br/>
with a history of going to college much later in life - not right out of <br/>
high school - and I&#39;ve talked about that proudly and happily with my kids.<br/>
<br/>
And yet, I have one graduated and thinking about grad school, and two in <br/>
the midst of going to college. The difference is they are very very <br/>
clear in their minds that they are choosing it from among a lot of <br/>
options and they very much know why they are there and they are <br/>
realistic about its value - they definitely don&#39;t see &quot;getting a degree&quot; <br/>
as enough of a goal to make it worth it to be there - they are there for <br/>
the learning and the experience itself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-10692664">I&#39;m catching up on posts (nowhere near through them all &lt;g&gt;) after the  <br/>
Life is Good conference, but I checked out Holly&#39;s vid.  In addition  <br/>
to her presence and sparkle, I noticed her speaking cadence is very  <br/>
much like yours, Sandra. You can tell she&#39;s your daughter. It&#39;s sweet.<br/>
