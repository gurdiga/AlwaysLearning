<div id="ygrps-yiv-2128996704">Last night as a family we all watched The Simpsons together for the first time.  My husband and I have seen pretty much every episode and really like the show, but I guess I never thought about introducing it to my kids (ages 8 & 4), thinking that the subject  matter might not interest them.  Boy was I wrong:)  They both thought it was absolutely hilarious.  Watching the show wasn&#39;t planned, we were all just sitting on the couch and I was flipping through the channels and stopped for a brief second and they both wanted to watch.  Both of them love potty humor and fart jokes to no end.  It&#39;s even that much funnier to them if there is a swear word or two thrown in the mix:)  They&#39;ve both watched the Family Guy on occasion and think it is also pretty funny.<br/>
<br/>
In the car a couple weeks ago we were listening to an interview on NPR with Trey Parker & Matt Stone (creators of South Park), and just hearing the dialogue and the few audio clips they played on the show really interested & amused my 8 year old.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe in censoring media, trusting that my kids know what their comfortable with.  That being said I have thought about introducing my 8 year old (which would also  mean introducing the 4 year old) to South Park, full well knowing that the 8 year old would think it was hilarious.  What are some opinions in introducing a show like South Park to such a young audience?  I know the shows deal with a lot different subject matter than say The Simpsons, and am not sure how much he would &quot;get&quot;.  Maybe I&#39;m already answering my own question in thinking that if he likes it enough to watch a full episode, then it doesn&#39;t really  matter how much he &quot;gets&quot;, just that it&#39;s enjoyable for him.<br/>
<br/>
Just looking for some experienced unschooled opinions here.<br/>

<br/>
You don&#39;t need to think of it as &quot;introducing them&quot; or even &quot;exposing  <br/>
them&quot; to it.  If you watch a little (just snippets, maybe) and they&#39;re  <br/>
interested, or not interested, there it is.  If they&#39;re interested,  <br/>
find some more.  If not, then do something different.<br/>
<br/>
The thing that got me interested in South Park was my son Marty, who  <br/>
was ten or eleven maybe, reciting a scene about rainbows.  Cartman  <br/>
says &quot;I HATE rainbows!&quot; and at the end of a little exchange, he says  <br/>
&quot;Oh, RainBOWS!  Yeah, I like those...&quot; or something.  So when I  <br/>
finally asked what he was reciting, and the kids showed me, I was  <br/>
hooked.<br/>
<br/>
Kids will like something altogether different from what the adults are  <br/>
liking.  That&#39;s how cartoons aimed at a broader audience are.  I  <br/>
enjoyed Rocky and Bullwinkle without getting all the jokes.  Bugs  <br/>
Bunny.  The Flintstones.    Same with The Simpsons and kids now.<br/>

Here&#39;s that scene without video, the part Marty used to quote:<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My son thoroughly enjoys the humour of The Simpsons, Family Guy and South Park. He&#39;s been watching all three shows since he was about eight (his ten years older sister was a fan). He&#39;s 14 now. I don&#39;t like any of them.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve watched the shows myself on occasion so I know enough about them and I&#39;ve explained to my son why I don&#39;t like them and he &#39;took that under advisement&#39;, as the saying goes. Humour&#39;s a personal thing. Usually my son and I watch TV together, but any of those particular shows he watches on his own and I go off and follow one of my own preferences. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s no big deal. I expect I will be doing a lot of watching TV on my own when the soccer World Cup arrives in June.<br/>

<br/>
I love that Rainbow clip:)<br/>
<br/>
I guess i used the wrong word &quot;introduce&quot;, I was thinking more like strew, since he&#39;s interested in that type of comedy.  <br/>
<br/>
I clicked on the link below and we watched a few other South Park clips on YouTube, he thought some was funny, but couldn&#39;t understand the characters (in that they talk really fast), and then walked away after about the third one, so we&#39;ll stick with The Simpsons & Family Guy for now.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to put in a great quote I saw recently regarding comedy:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I think it&#39;s the duty of the comedian to see where the line is drawn and then cross it deliberately&quot; - George Carlin<br/>
<br/>
My dad had records from George Carlin while us kids were growing up that we repeatedly listened to, very foul, and we thought they were hilarious.  I&#39;m thinking I was probably around 10 or older.   I think it was intensified growing up in a very conservative suburb in Utah where we were one of the few in our neighborhood that were in the minority (religiously speaking).  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-299562281">Sounds like a great family dynamic.  I know other families whose parents dislike those shows, so they won&#39;t let their children watch them either.  Doesn&#39;t make for great relationships.<br/>
