<div id="ygrps-yiv-211505737"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;We&#39;ve compromised on a round HOUSE with real walls<br/>
&gt;and such! &lt;g&gt; Only three interior walls, no doors.<br/>
&gt;There&#39;ll be one great room:living/dining/kitchen, a <br/>
&gt;bath and our bedroom. We&#39;re planning a separate wing<br/>
&gt;for the boys with a living area, two small sleeping<br/>
&gt;quarters and a bath. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Kelly&#39;s been peeping at our building plans!  This<br/>
sounds almost exactly like what we are building on our<br/>
land.  Even the wing for our boys with the small<br/>
sleeping quarters and living space.  We&#39;re putting<br/>
their own entrance/mudroom on the back of the house<br/>
off their area too.  In later years, if/when they live<br/>
elsewhere, we may rent that space out. <br/>
<br/>
We are using natural building techniques and this is<br/>
all part of our efforts with Intentional Community<br/>
building.  I&#39;ve fallen in love with masonry<br/>
heaters/woodstoves, the kind with integrated bread<br/>
ovens, and am planning one in the heart of our home,<br/>
with living room space on the fireplace side and<br/>
kitchen on the oven side.  I hope your round house is<br/>
lovely, sane, loving space for your family when you<br/>
get it all done.<br/>
