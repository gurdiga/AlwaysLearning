what&#39;s really important.<br/>
<br/>
  One of Ben&#39;s airmen got some really bad news. Her 17 year old son was <br/>
in a bad car accident a few weeks ago and was a bit spooked. He wasn&#39;t <br/>
injured, but he didn&#39;t want to drive. He decided to walk to work <br/>
earlier this week. Seven miles. Nearing 100 degrees. After a few miles, <br/>
he became disoriented and collapsed. He was nearly hit by a car as he <br/>
fell. Next driver picked him up and hurried him to the hospital.<br/>
<br/>
  Heat stroke. His temperature was 107. BP was wacky (Ben told me, but I <br/>
forget). He was in a coma yesterday, but his mom learned today that he <br/>
was brain-dead.<br/>
<br/>
 It&#39;s so sad. It&#39;s been a very hard day.<br/>
<br/>
  She now decides whether to remove the feeding tube. Ben will go up to <br/>
the hospital to be with her tonight.<br/>
<br/>
 He is 17.<br/>

what they could be that many set their sites as low as possible. They <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1648959835">Such a sad sad situation Kelly. You have caused me to love my children more<br/>
fully right now. I feel so deeply sad for this family, in particular, this<br/>
mom. And Ben is in my thoughts as well...I am in great admiration for what<br/>
he is doing, and how challenging this may be.<br/>
<br/>
I think I will share this story with my children. This is a very real<br/>
situation where we live. We&#39;re in Phoenix and it has been over 110 daily for<br/>
the last month.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for sharing this Kelly....<br/>
