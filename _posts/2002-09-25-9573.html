<div id="ygrps-yiv-1197336620">Of cob or adobe:<br/>
&lt;&lt; It is untouched by earthquakes,<br/>
and totally fireproof as well.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not the roofs.<br/>
<br/>
When adobe houses burn, the roofs and floors go (if they had wood <br/>
floors--lots of the older ones had dirt. and a fair number of newer ones have <br/>
concrete), the window frames and doors go, and there goes the house, pretty <br/>
much.<br/>
<br/>
My room, when I was a kid, had a dirt roof over boards and tarpaper.  Weeds <br/>
grew on it.  If it had been like a moss or grass roof, it would&#39;ve been okay, <br/>
but these weeds could make long roots and break through the paper and make <br/>
the roof leak, so we had to pull them.  (My dad did anyway.)  The rest of the <br/>
house had been dirt when we moved in, but they put tar and gravel on instead. <br/>
 The reason they didn&#39;t do that on my room is I hadn&#39;t moved in there yet.  <br/>
It was a half-in-the-ground storage and canning room.  But when I was 14 and <br/>
really wanted my own room, I moved in there.  One wall was all shelves!  <br/>
Across was a &quot;banco,&quot; a built in adobe seat, the length of the wall.  That <br/>
wall had a high shelf of a long, thick board, probably 14&#39; long, a foot wide <br/>
and 2&quot; thick, and that was structural, totally built into the wall.  The <br/>
walls were plastered except that one behind the wall of canning shelves, and <br/>
that was original unplastered adobe.  <br/>
<br/>
I loved that room!  I ended up only being in it three years, because I went <br/>
to college early and my parents divorced and my dad sold the house.  I was <br/>
sad.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a photo of that house from the north at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/60s">http://sandradodd.com/60s</a><br/>
but my room was on the east side and doesn&#39;t show at all.  <br/>
<br/>
My first marriage, we lived in a farm house with two built-in stoves.  It was <br/>
an old four-room farm house extended to eight rooms, but all still in adobe.  <br/>
 It had an attic.   After I was gone from there and my sister-in-law (one of <br/>
the kids we were raising) was grown and had two kids of her own, she was <br/>
living in that house and it caught fire and burned.  Nobody was hurt, but <br/>
lots of family souvenirs were gone.   <br/>
<br/>
The newest two rooms did not burn, because they had a separate, flat roof, <br/>
and my grandmother&#39;s old piano was in there.  Still is.  A remodel of that <br/>
house built the piano in!!  (We could have made a track of plywood way around <br/>
the house and taken it out the back, but it wasn&#39;t worth moving.  It was a <br/>
really old piano which had already done the church-nursery circuit in West <br/>
Texas churches, so now it&#39;s in part of an old ruined house and kids go play <br/>
it with the sun streaming in.  That&#39;s cool.)<br/>
<br/>
It was the fireplace that started the fire.  Insufficient insulation up <br/>
through the ceiling and they didn&#39;t clean the flue enough.<br/>
<br/>
Ruthie&#39;s husband built her a bigger, better, adobe house a hundred yards away.<br/>
<br/>
Six acre farm plots are good for that.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t live in adobe now, but I wish I did.  It&#39;s warm in the winter and <br/>
cool in the summer.  I used to want my bed against the wall, so in summer I <br/>
could lean up against the cool adobe wall.  And the houses were quieter than <br/>
frame houses or brick, because the sound is muffled in a nice way.  We used <br/>
to put pictures on the wall with nails, and then just fill in the holes when <br/>
we pulled the (BIG) nails out,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well yes, of course, wood burns.  I said that COB was<br/>
fire proof, not the acoutraments that might go with<br/>
it.  Many traditional cob homes in the UK have<br/>
thatched roofs.  Those would burn of course.  If the<br/>
roof beams are wood, they will burn.   However, most<br/>
modern cob homes have adobe, stone, concrete or brick<br/>
floors, because passive solar is big in Natural<br/>
Building, and you need a thermal massive floor to<br/>
accept the heat from passive solar Southern facing<br/>
windows and store it.<br/>
<br/>
Also, in a damp climate, aluminum or green roofs<br/>
(living sod with plants) is better than a flamable<br/>
type of roof.  Modern green roofs can be built in a<br/>
number of ways, most of which do not involve major use<br/>
of wood, due to the weight loads necessary to support<br/>
the weight of the earth, plants and water they absorb<br/>
when it rains.<br/>
<br/>
And you&#39;re right, cob or adobe (much the same except<br/>
for construction technique) are cool in summer and<br/>
warm in winter, and sound insulating as well.  <br/>
<br/>
In answer to someone else&#39;s question, I don&#39;t think<br/>
adobe can be used everywhere, because the process<br/>
requires sun curing the bricks, and not all climates<br/>
would be able to do that to sufficient temperatures or<br/>
for enough days to do all the bricks.  Sandra might<br/>
know more about that, with all her adobe experiences<br/>
growing up in the SW?  <br/>
<br/>
But I do think that variations of earth building, like<br/>
cob, could work in any climate.  They already do,<br/>
since England was the greatest military power in the<br/>
world for a long time, and took their building<br/>
practices with them and built cob houses all over the<br/>
world.  So there are examples in Africa (hybrid of<br/>
African techniques and British) Australia, New<br/>
Zealand, all over the UK, and etc.  In the US, there<br/>
are two major cob teaching and building companies in<br/>
central Oregon which teach how to build in the NW<br/>
climate and they also do on site workshops all over<br/>
the country and have experience in many different<br/>
climates that way.  It&#39;s really a versatile technique<br/>
that is as old as mud huts.<br/>

it&#39;s probably because we paid big bucks to make it so.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s called &quot;bricks&quot; and that&#39;s why bricks work in wet climates, because <br/>
they&#39;re fired.<br/>
<br/>
But adobe doesn&#39;t have to be made with fancy fireable clay.  When it&#39;s in a <br/>
dry place, it&#39;s going to stay pretty dry.<br/>
<br/>
One of the rooms of our house (the fancy all-authentic show room of the <br/>
addition) was not stuccoed.  We plastered it with mud every year, the <br/>
authentic way.<br/>
<br/>
Another friend of ours, Bill Yanda, years and years ago an ultra-authentic <br/>
room in his remodelled adobe house.  The floor was dirt cured/finished with <br/>
cow&#39;s blood.  <br/>
<br/>
Modern stucco is pretty nice stuff, though unnatural.  It has an element of <br/>
acrylic, so instead of putting cement on your mud house, you&#39;re putting hard <br/>
and somewhat flexible plastic.  Old stucco cracks.  New stucco doesn&#39;t.<br/>

style of certain regions (Devonshire for instance, and<br/>
much of Ireland.)  Anywhere that didn&#39;t have much<br/>
lumber, but had plenty of sod and peat and things like<br/>
that.  So it would depend on the region from which a<br/>

<br/>
Does anyone here know the names of a little series (three or four books) from <br/>
the 1970&#39;s or late 1960&#39;s by a guy who did pen and ink drawings about wood <br/>
construction, trees, traditional building styles with wood, and the first was <br/>
called (I think) &quot;The Love of Wood&quot;?  Maybe?<br/>
<br/>
I used to have a couple of them and let them go to friends thinking I could <br/>
always find more.  I LOVED those books.<br/>
<br/>
My husband has been doing woodworking lately.  Medieval-style boxes and <br/>
chests, carving knotwork by hand, just slowly for his own enjoyment.  It&#39;s <br/>
reminding me.<br/>
<br/>
I made a door once, three layers and with a window in it, for a greenhouse we <br/>
added onto that same adobe house I was talking about earlier, that burned.  <br/>
It was fun.  We cut down below a windowsill to put that in, but we left <br/>
the... (forgot the name---the wood cross piece above where the window frame <br/>
had been), and put the door fram in the space below that.  So it was a <br/>
shortish door. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt;Carolyn Begley <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Many building materials disintegrate when exposed to<br/>
constant wetness or climate.  Sheetrock/wallboard,<br/>
wood, paint, plywood, particle board, etc.  Earth<br/>
built structures need to have a plaster on them to<br/>
protect them from the weather, and it&#39;s a good idea to<br/>
have a roof overhang to protect them from direct<br/>
washes of rainwater.  Natural plasters work great.  <br/>
<br/>
But they are not all that fragile, when done properly<br/>
and approriately for the climate.  If cob structures<br/>
can survive in the Damp of Ireland and England for<br/>
hundreds of years, that says something about their<br/>
ability to withstand a wetter climate than adobe can. <br/>
<br/>
Carolyn, you might attribute your homes lack of<br/>
thermal integrity to your roof, and you may be right<br/>
in large part, because metal is hot in the summer and<br/>
cold in the winter and transfers that directly to the<br/>
interior space (just like a metal pan transfers the<br/>
heat of the stove).  Heat also rises, and while you<br/>
are busily heating your home in the winter, the heat<br/>
is not only escaping through the uninsulated metal,<br/>
but also rising, being cooled and falling again into<br/>
your home as cooled air.  <br/>
<br/>
But I think it also telling that your home was built<br/>
piecemeal, including stickbuilt portions.  They, too,<br/>
might be compromising the thermal dynamics of your<br/>
adobe portions.  Stickbuilt construction has only a<br/>
fraction of the thermal mass of adobe; is not as<br/>

the wall almost as effectively as ductwork.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-558804181">Christian Bruyere and Robert Inwood wrote several books with line<br/>
drawings about natural building.  Maybe not the ones you&#39;re thinking of.<br/>
<br/>
We have &quot;Country Comforts&quot; and &quot;In Harmony With Nature&quot; and there is<br/>
another we borrowed from a friend called  &quot;Creative Country<br/>
Construction.&quot;   They&#39;re all good, kinda funky, very fun to read and<br/>
browse.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1305242806">I must have missed this thread but let me tell you something. I used to be an accountant for a lady named Simone Swan who is THE master adobe builder for the world. REALLY! She studied in Egypt and then came to Terlingua, Texas and started her adobe buildings there. She builds adobe houses in a pyramid shape,in fact, her story is in Architecture Digest (although I don&#39;t remember the year but I can find out). Her builder is a woman named Jesusita Jimenez, who is also world renowned. She is the actual adobe maker while Simone is the designer, so to speak. Awesome buildings.... also straw houses are making a big comeback, esp. in Far West Texas. Mary in Va.<br/>

Yes, my sister in Terligua had Simone help her build her adobe <br/>
dome.  It&#39;s pretty cool.  Did any of you check it out when I posted <br/>
it before?  Twistedroad.com  She has photos of her dome, her straw <br/>
bale, and a cob structure, so far.  <br/>
The living is a little spartan compared to my suburban lifestyle, <br/>
but it&#39;s fun to watch.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I did, I read the whole website and looked at all the<br/>
pictures.  Who did her website?  It&#39;s wonderful!  I<br/>
love all the quotes at the bottoms of the pages,<br/>
they&#39;re great and very appropriate.  I love what they<br/>
have done with their natural building and off grid<br/>
living.  I wonder about codes for building in her<br/>
area, that she could do all that she has in the way<br/>
that she has.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m very into voluntary simplicty, and was impressed<br/>
with all that she has accomplished.  You&#39;re sister is<br/>
a gutsy lady.  Thanks so much for the website link.  I<br/>
am sending it to my husband as a reference for<br/>
building to catalog with all our others.  There is<br/>
some fantastic information on there.<br/>

ago. Building with cob. So far, all of my questions<br/>
have been answered without asking any. Lots of<br/>
workshops in the Washington, Oregon, California venue.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Cob can be used anywhere....(that I&#39;ve read about, so<br/>
far) <br/>

Found the list via, your guessed, google :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1188411034">That is the GREAT thing about Far West Texas.... no building codes! About the only thing that people enforce down there is the border crossings ( since Sept. 11) and that means a LOT of businesses are doing poorly. Plus people who have worked in the US for YEARS can&#39;t now. They even had to cancel &#39;Good Neighbors Day&#39; because so many people couldn&#39;t come across to participate. Yeah thanks to Jean for her info. on the website. Mary in Va.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1632656263">Even though it&#39;s been a while....<br/>
<br/>
I just got back from three weeks traveling about the US with my darling <br/>
teenage daughter.<br/>
Sometime in week two, we were at the Prairie Museum in Kansas somewhere (we <br/>
needed to stop for gas and, hey, look at that... wanna go check it out?) <br/>
where they had a, get this, SOD house.  Chunks of sod, cut in deep bricks, <br/>
grass still included (long dead), dirt exposed to the outside (and inside), <br/>
grass on the roof too (on top of wood planks) - and it was structurally <br/>
sound years and years later!    It was very, very cool.  Literally as well <br/>
as it was quite warm that day.<br/>
<br/>
By the by, straw bale houses are very fire resistant.  They smoulder, but <br/>
won&#39;t burst into flame - even when not &#39;sealed&#39; by an earth plaster or <br/>
stucco.  They&#39;ve gone upwards of 1500 degrees, when I think it is that wood <br/>
bursts into flame at 500 or 800 or something paltry like that.  Also, for <br/>
the person with the noisy tin roof, it isn&#39;t unusual (kinda) to insulate <br/>
roofs with strawbales.  You&#39;ve just got to figure out how to get them to <br/>
stay put, as your roof is already on.  There&#39;s also a straw bale house in <br/>
Nebraska from the late 1800&#39;s/early 1900&#39;s that is intact and just <br/>
fine.  ...and it not only rains in Nebraska, it snows too!  So long as the <br/>
bales dry out (or optimally are sealed up in an earth plaster) they&#39;ll do <br/>
just fine in wet surroundings.  A straw bale home needs good boots and a <br/>
hat and it&#39;ll be fine.  (grin)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, kudo&#39;s to the person doing the cob house.  I looked into it as a <br/>
very cool option, but didn&#39;t want to mess with getting the clay/sand mix <br/>
right and it looked like it would take longer than bale, so I passed on it <br/>
so far.  It sure is beautiful, though!<br/>
<br/>
And now, I have to unpack.  Unpacking is the worst part of traveling about.<br/>
