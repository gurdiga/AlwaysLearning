<div id="ygrps-yiv-1854470771">All right, I guess I have to watch it AGAIN and pay closer attention to that scene!<br/>
I musta missed that part. <br/>
Chosen one for what? Who would Anakin be compared to in the great scheme of &quot;things&quot;, if anyone?<br/>

  &gt; &gt;LOL Mary! That has bugged me too, since we saw episode I.<br/>
  &gt; &gt;Who IS Anakin&#39;s father? I bet whoever it was gave him all those<br/>
  &gt; &gt;midi-chlorians. :-)<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; I think the implication is that he is the chosen one. In fact, they may even<br/>
  &gt; use those words. I can&#39;t remember. i just remember it being very<br/>
  &gt; allegorical.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I thought Anakin&#39;s mother made it clear that she hadn&#39;t &quot;been with&quot; <br/>
  anyone when Anakin was conceived.  We got the movie on DVD last week.<br/>
  I think it&#39;s time to watch it again!<br/>

With five more movies to go (if they live that long) it could be all kinds of <br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe to be the father of Luke.  <br/>

Maybe Luke needs to be a product of two immaculate conceptions!</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was looking for the exact dialogue where she reveals the birth to be an <br/>
immaculate conception. It&#39;s in there, but I couldn&#39;t find the text online. <br/>
However, I did come across a site called Christian Analysis of American <br/>
Culture (CAP). Here&#39;s part of their analysis of Episode 1:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The matters incorporated into Offense to God, including issues of <br/>
counterfeiting and mockery of the Scriptures, were unfortunately<br/>
quite serious. Among other issues, the script presented a claim of Anakin <br/>
being a virgin birth thus equating him with Jesus, multiple<br/>
implications of the &quot;will of the force&quot; being equatable to the Will of God <br/>
and His Control, foreseeing into the future, and calling Anakin<br/>
&quot;the chosen one&quot; to bring reconciliation of the universal forces of good and <br/>
evil, again equating Anakin with Jesus.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Except for the matters of unholiness, the ignominy in the movie should <br/>
clearly be fantasy to the young and impressionable and should<br/>
thus be easily redirected by caring, *participative* parents. If you do go, <br/>
please talk it over with your kids, ESPECIALLY about the<br/>
unholiness.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I guess they seemed to fear it would be a religious experience for some. ;-)<br/>
