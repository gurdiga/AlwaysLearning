<div id="ygrps-yiv-1631347423">I joined this list about a month ago and have been enjoying, delighting, reacting, investigating, surrendering, relinquishing and deeply pondering as a result of the questions and insights shared here. My daughter, Twyla, is almost 1 and I am finding myself becoming more and more inspired and excited about the principles of Unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
This morning as I was preparing to do the dishes Twyla excitedly leaned in to the sink to touch the bubbles. We both laughed as she fiddled with them for a while. My arms started getting tired so I scooped up a little of the bubbles and put them in containers for her to explore next to me. The interesting thing was that as i reached back in to do the dishes I started to play with the bubbles too! Suddenly the &#39;chore&#39; became interesting, fun and an opportunity to share an experience. Her natural curiosity and delight is kindling my own. <br/>
<br/>
I am finding that there is a &#39;yes&#39; that lives at the heart of each moment. Sometimes it is subtle or hidden - but it is there.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your insights<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What a lovely picture. And, being aware of it now will help you be able <br/>
to have those kinds of sweet thoughts later, even when she&#39;s off playing <br/>
in the other room and even when she&#39;s a teenager and off doing her own <br/>
thing.<br/>
