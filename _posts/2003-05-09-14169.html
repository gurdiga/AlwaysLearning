<div id="ygrps-yiv-1457964906">I hope I haven&#39;t already told you folks this story, but if so the newer <br/>
listmembers can read it.  I&#39;m cleaning out my mailbox, though, and didn&#39;t <br/>
want it to go untold.   <br/>
<br/>
April 24.  Marty (14) came in and was describing some exciting detail of one <br/>
of the games he&#39;s was designing, and read this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If an antagonist is assigned a protagonist you can spend one conviction to <br/>
reverse the assignment&quot;  but he mispronounced &quot;antagonist.&quot;  He knew he was, <br/>
he was stumbling, and I said it for him and he said &quot;right!&quot; and went on.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the whole story. &lt;g&gt;  Thanks for reading.<br/>
<br/>
The reason I saved it is that it seemed a peek into Marty&#39;s writing and <br/>
reading levels.  <br/>
He knows the word visually, but he hadn&#39;t heard it so much out in the air.  I <br/>
think that&#39;s a point at which the odd kind of reading people do when they get <br/>
fast is proven.  There&#39;s an English language past sounding out words, in a <br/>
way.  There&#39;s that total reading for comprehension, not for the art of it.   <br/>
And that&#39;s the way I read almost always, which is probably why poetry is <br/>
generally irritating to me.  I don&#39;t turn the words back into sound when I <br/>
read.  I know how, but that&#39;s another kind of slow (and kind of irritating <br/>
for me, honestly) reading.   I don&#39;t think this is such a great thing but <br/>
it&#39;s highly prized in school and testing situations.  <br/>
<br/>
So for good or ill, I saw a flash of it in Marty mispronouncing a word he had <br/>
himself dredged up, written down, and used correctly.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, I didn&#39;t know those terms &quot;antagonist and protagonist&quot; when I <br/>
was his age, and I was it on a stick at my school, the #1 student and I had <br/>
an ID card to prove it.  (Weird but true, they numbered our IDs in the order <br/>
of our test scores on some special test for some special program they were <br/>
trying at our school, and they &quot;tracked us,&quot; and the top group had special <br/>
color school IDs that said &quot;the go-go group&quot; and although I don&#39;t remember <br/>
any special privileges that went with it, I remember thinking even then that <br/>
it was a kind of social and interpersonal mistake for them to have done that.)<br/>
<br/>
So without testing him, there was a snapshot moment where I could compare him <br/>
to other fixed marks.   It might be a month or many years before one comes <br/>
along on its own again, and it&#39;s not important, but I thought it was <br/>
interesting in a &quot;how do you know what your kids are learning&quot; kind of way.<br/>

<br/>
That reminds me -- about Reading -- I had a bad day at the park<br/>
yesterday with the more structured (than me) homeschoolers.  I&#39;ve spent<br/>
so much time here in the chatty back porch of the unschoolers haven that<br/>
I forget how outnumbered we are.  I forget how &quot;extreme&quot; my views are<br/>
and how &quot;silly&quot; I think their views are.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re just starting up a small homeschooling group and most of the other<br/>
kids (by coincidence) are about 12 years old, while my son is 9.  Most<br/>
of the other mom&#39;s just took their kids out of public or private school<br/>
this year, while I was unschooling from the get go.  There&#39;s A LOT of<br/>
curriculum talk.  It seems to be pretty consistent that all of these<br/>
(four) 12 year olds are ahead of &quot;grade level&quot; in reading, about on<br/>
level in math, and &quot;behind&quot; in writing.  Every one of the mom&#39;s has<br/>
praised her child&#39;s advanced reading abilities, and yet they all seem to<br/>
use reading curriculum.  Curriculum!  For reading!  For older kids who<br/>
read quite well!  This is totally perplexing to me.  <br/>
<br/>
I never felt like a weirdo in my old homeschooling group, but I do now. <br/>
Moving stinks!<br/>

enough to read poetry for myself, either. And I don&#39;t listen to myself <br/>
when I read out loud - I drift away and go on autopilot. Once I&#39;ve <br/>
heard poetry read aloud, if I like it, I can read it for myself after <br/>
that. I can read Shakespeare, for example, and REALLY enjoy what I&#39;m <br/>
reading - but I only developed that ability AFTER my family was <br/>
involved with a Shakespeare theater group for a couple of years and I <br/>
had heard a LOT of it out loud.<br/>

We should have!!<br/>
<br/>
Another thing in those days.  We had been tracked in 7th and 8th grade too, <br/>
and I was used to the same kids, most of whom I had already been a <br/>
self-selected subculture from elementary and outside school.  So I stretch <br/>
and yawn and show up for the first day of 9th grade, 1st period, English <br/>
class, and English was the one class in which the tracking was perfect--the <br/>
base/real class.   <br/>
<br/>
I had never seen 2/3 of those kids.  ALL new.  FRESH SOCIAL MEAT FOR ME!!<br/>
<br/>
My best friend had moved to Colorado, so soon I had a new friend, and I had a <br/>
boyfriend from that group soon, and really enjoyed the new stimuli, life <br/>
stories, friends-of-friends.  It was the safest biggest change I could have <br/>
had and still be in the same school!<br/>
<br/>
Some of you already figured out where a new batch of 9th graders would come <br/>
from, huh?<br/>
<br/>
The local Catholic school.<br/>
<br/>
Their test scores were higher than our school&#39;s, so when they folded in their <br/>
test scores with ours, nearly 20 of our former top class were cut down to 2nd <br/>
tier.  <br/>
<br/>
Not a pro-school story by any means, just a snapshot moment.<br/>
<br/>
And it was 1967, so we SHOULD have had go-go boots, but just the girls.  <br/>

<br/>
In some Writing/Poetry class in high school, I think freshman year, we<br/>
had to write a poem.<br/>
I did a Dylan Thomas-esque thing, putting words together unusually and<br/>
arranging them for sound alone.<br/>
There was no content, it didn&#39;t mean anything, it was my idea of a joke<br/>
and I wrote it in five minutes.<br/>
<br/>
The teacher called my parents to tell them I had some great genius and I<br/>
needed to meet her father, a university professor who could help my gift<br/>
evolve.<br/>
<br/>
It was a joke and she totally missed it.  It was a poem about nothing.<br/>
Whatever she thought she saw wasn&#39;t there.   I didn&#39;t have any respect<br/>
for her after that.<br/>
And I&#39;ve often wondered how many great poets just sat down and wrote any<br/>
damn thing that came to mind, and laughed about it later. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I love poetry.   I love that sound, and poetry is noisy, swirly in my<br/>
head.  I love Dylan Thomas especially for that reason, and the poor guy<br/>
was tanked twenty three hours a day.    <br/>
<br/>
My husband writes great magnetic refrigerator poetry, in the (x-rated)<br/>
spirit of Allen Ginsberg. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

The Emperor&#39;s New Clothes.  Your teacher found them beautiful!<br/>
<br/>
So many people express awe when they&#39;re actually baffled.<br/>
<br/>
The Emperor&#39;s New Clothes is one story that too few people have heard or read <br/>
and fewer still really think about.   Probably most of them just read it <br/>
check the time to see how they&#39;re doing on reading speed, glad to have <br/>
finished another task, and think &quot;What a great story!&quot; (because they&#39;re <br/>
baffled).<br/>

<br/>
I remember puzzling &quot;why would grown-ups do that?&quot;  Only the child&#39;s<br/>
behavior at the end of the story made any sense to me.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid, I couldn&#39;t see through anything but a kid&#39;s eyes.  (I<br/>
had been raised by adults that were mostly honest, so I expected honesty<br/>
from adults.)  I couldn&#39;t grasp why anyone in the story would delude<br/>
themselves, or attempt to delude others about the clothes in such away. <br/>
(I understood the con men, but not the &quot;yes men&quot;.)<br/>
<br/>
But now, as an analogy, the story makes perfect sense.  It represents<br/>
the many truisms in our culture that are taken at face value and never<br/>
examined too carefully.  The moral of that story really works for our<br/>
educational instutions, our parenting rules, and some of our most<br/>
strongly rooted scientific theoretical models.<br/>
<br/>

PS  Do you have any Emperor&#39;s New Clothes links on your website?  A<br/>
collection of unschooling parables sounds like a neat thing.</div>
