<div id="ygrps-yiv-2056214879">Hi Nancy. I did wonder as I wrote it whether anyone would understand it :-) It&#39;s an ageless phrase here, so don&#39;t worry about getting old! &#39;Hard case&#39; is similar to &#39;far out&#39; but also funny, in a quirky sort of way. I&#39;ll find out the origin of it and tell you. I&#39;m sure I knew once, but I&#39;ve forgotten. Now can you please translate &#39;gnarly&#39; for me?<br/>

  OK, I&#39;m officially old.  I have never heard anything called &quot;so hard case.&quot;<br/>
  Translation, please?<br/>

<br/>
Gnarly is (was?) a surfer word, although my friends and I *watched* surfers,<br/>
rather than participated in the sport.  It was a positive, often referring<br/>
to the wave or the ride.  I think one is most likely to hear it these days<br/>
on The Simpsons, from the bus driver Otto, often followed by &quot;dude.&quot;<br/>

Not Nancy, but &#39;gnarly&#39; I belive came from surfers, at least all the surfers I know use it. It kinda like cool, rad, but more, if that makes sence. Something thats really big and really great.<br/>

tall ship, Star of India, docked downtown.  They say the Star traveled the<br/>
route from England to New Zealand for many years, transporting emigrants;<br/>
according to the docent, virtually every white New Zealander can trace an<br/>
ancestor to that ship.<br/>

Neat, I&#39;ll have to check it out, I&#39;m not sure if my family is from NZ, I know that my dad was born in the states, and we lived in NZ, when he was stationed in Antartica, he found out when we moved there that he had cousins, on his dads side that livrd there, he had never known about them. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll look into it though.<br/>

<br/>
Trace AN ancestor isn&#39;t &quot;trace all their ancestors&quot; though.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the long-established LDS families in Salt Lake City can trace back to <br/>
one of two famous founders, through one line or another.  Doesn&#39;t mean he was <br/>
ALL their grandfathers.  Just one great great or so will do it.   (Though <br/>
it&#39;s likely easier for Mormons than Aussies.)  Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, <br/>
LOTS and lots of offspring by 2003.<br/>
