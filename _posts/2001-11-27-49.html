<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not a big fan of &quot;limits&quot;. I prefer to frame it as meeting everyone&#39;s<br/>
needs. I don&#39;t want my kid to think &quot;Mom said no so I have to stop<br/>
asking&quot;, I want her to understand why mom said no... or, actually, mom<br/>
rarely says no outright, I tend more to say, &quot;I&#39;m rather not do X because<br/>
Y&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m worried that it we X, Y will happen.&quot; and then she&#39;ll either<br/>
agree, or have a plan to avoid Y, or whatever. <br/>
<br/>
I also think it helps to talk about stuff before it gets out of hand,<br/>
like, &quot;I&#39;m feeling a bit stressed with all the noise and crowds here<br/>
already and I&#39;d like to get this shopping trip down fast, so could you<br/>
just go get X and Y and meet me at the checkout, and we&#39;ll zoom?&quot; And I<br/>
try to excourage and listen to her, too, when i want to stop at the<br/>
grocery store because we&#39;re out of milk and she says, &quot;Could we not<br/>
today, I really just want to go home.&quot; then we don&#39;t stop, because she<br/>
only says it when she really isn&#39;t up to a trip...<br/>
<br/>
And there are off days, of course, cranky grumpy times, and often the<br/>
best thing to do then seems to be to call a halt to whatever we&#39;re doing<br/>
and go out for coffee and chess... just take a break.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; about not arguing and letting him nurse as much as desired but I am at <br/>
&gt; that nursing stage where it is starting to get a little irritating <br/>
&gt; physically as my cycle ebbs and flows (pun intended LOL)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Rice Krispies are fine, really. That plus breastmilk makes a pretty<br/>
healthy diet, IMO. I really think the food thing ebbs and flows, children<br/>
spend months or a year or two eating this seemingly narrow range, then<br/>
suddenly start trying all sorts of things, if they aren&#39;t coerced into<br/>
it. I know many, many small children who ate only a few things, and<br/>
they&#39;re all fine...<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes trying to limit nursing makes kids want to nurse more, I&#39;m not<br/>
sure if you&#39;re limiting it all the time or just those days of the<br/>
month... It is hard to feel good about nursing when it&#39;s physically<br/>
uncomfortable, though. My daughter used to generally nurse more when we<br/>
stayed around the house, if your son is the same way then maybe planning<br/>
more out of the house activities on those days would help...<br/>
