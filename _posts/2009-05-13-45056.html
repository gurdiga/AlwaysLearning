<div id="ygrps-yiv-1585519067">This isn&#39;t about speaking up, really, but a great tool I&#39;ve used for<br/>
the past couple of years is a little bottle of bubbles that I keep in<br/>
my purse. It&#39;s larger than those wedding bubbles, but smaller than a<br/>
&quot;standard&quot; bottle; I guess it&#39;s 3 ounces or so.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m in the grocery store or Target or wherever and I see that a<br/>
child is having a meltdown, and either the parent isn&#39;t responding or<br/>
is getting more and more angry, I&#39;ll get out the bubbles. I can stand<br/>
some distance away and blow the bubbles in their direction - kids are<br/>
enchanted with bubbles, and it usually works to completely dismantle (?<br/>
not the right word) the situation. The child gets distracted and<br/>
sometimes happy, and the parent gets a minute to breathe. I&#39;ve only had<br/>
one negative reaction in the many times I&#39;ve done this.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I had to look hard to find a good bottle that didn&#39;t leak in my purse.<br/>
<br/>
I like this...the kids and I will start looking for a bottle tomorrow - thanks!<br/>
