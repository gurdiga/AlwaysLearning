revulsion.  But I read more and I&#39;m thinking of ordering it, as a souvenir<br/>
of<br/>
how weird this homeschooling movement could really get.  I guess I could<br/>
order just the sample, but maybe I want the whole thing.<br/>
<br/>
I bought the McGuffey readers a couple of years and couldn&#39;t believe it when<br/>
I saw them.  I never figured out why so many homeschoolers recommend them.<br/>
I tried to read one to the boys but they were bored and so was I.  I never<br/>
bothered and just figured I was weird and was missing something obvious.  I<br/>
am relieved to see that someone else wasn&#39;t in love with these readers.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine I will hold onto these long enough for the new versions to<br/>
be valuable as collectors items.  Wouldn&#39;t it be fun to do a homeschooler&#39;s<br/>
museum and put things like that in there.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Interesting isn&#39;t the motive for using them. ;-) It&#39;s the promise of<br/>
discipline and thoroughness. The descriptions at AOBS (American Opinion Book<br/>
Service -- a decidedly fundamentalist Christian site) describes them as<br/>
&quot;Their popularity is due to the comprehensive nature of their contents and<br/>
the disciplined thinking they inspire in the student.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a very interesting history -- with some fundamentalist sentiment<br/>
thrown in -- at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://aobs-store.com/reviews/mcgr7hb.htm">http://aobs-store.com/reviews/mcgr7hb.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s part:<br/>
<br/>
McGuffey Readers were most popular west of the Alleghenies and in the South.<br/>
They were popular for many reasons:<br/>
<br/>
 Children liked the Readers. They included simple yet charming stories with<br/>
pictures and rural settings with which they could identify. Other readers of<br/>
the time, published mainly in Unitarian New England, were written by Boston<br/>
Brahmin types. Unlike the McGuffey Readers, the New England readers were<br/>
pretentiously aimed at gifted students from privileged families. The<br/>
McGuffeyReaders were created specifically for the growing number of new<br/>
European emigrants and for the rural American middle class.<br/>
<br/>
 Unlike their New England rivals, McGuffey Readers were basically free from<br/>
the endless haranguing of social reformers on inflammatory issues such as<br/>
slavery. Instead of a frontal assault demanding radical social reform, the<br/>
McGuffey Readers employed a more tempered (and more effective) method to<br/>
teach children the evils of slavery. In a famous lesson called &quot;The Birds<br/>
Set Free,&quot; a rich man approaches a boy who is selling caged birds for 50<br/>
cents apiece. The man proceeds to buy the entire cageful from the lad. No<br/>
sooner is the deal transacted than the man turns the entire stock loose,<br/>
explaining to the boy: &quot;I was shut up three years in a French prison, as a<br/>
prisoner of war, and I am resolved to never see any thing in prison which I<br/>
can make free.&quot; Thus, under the guise of teaching kindness to animals, a<br/>
powerful yet gentle anti-slavery message is taught.<br/>
<br/>
 They were published in Cincinnati, the gateway to the American West at the<br/>
time. As a result, in their early editions, the McGuffey Readers were<br/>
blatantly &quot;pro-Western.&quot; The Readers were written and compiled for rural<br/>
Western Americans. During the 19th century America was moving west both<br/>
physically and spiritually. There was a tremendous amount of regional pride.<br/>
The McGuffey publishers hoped to capitalize on this regional pride by boldly<br/>
stating that these were &quot;Western books for Western people.&quot; In the 1844<br/>
edition, as a response to the growing national reputation and sales of the<br/>
McGuffey Readers, they changed their marketing approach. With only minor<br/>
changes in the contents, the publisher proclaimed that the revised Readers<br/>
contained &quot;no sectional matter.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
and<br/>
<br/>
Instead of pointless fluff, McGuffey offered an astonishing anthology of the<br/>
greatest English and American literature. The Readers feature Bible<br/>
selections, as well as poems by Wordsworth, Byron, Milton, Whittier, Poe,<br/>
Emerson, and Shakespeare. In addition, the Readers include prose selections<br/>
from the works of Addison and Steele, Macaulay, Parson Weems, James<br/>
Fennimore Cooper, Blackstone, Hawthorne, Thackeray, and the great Samuel<br/>
Johnson. With all the writers included, it is interesting to note that<br/>
Washington Irving was the most featured writer.<br/>
<br/>
and<br/>
<br/>
The basic McGuffey Readers were revised many times through the years.<br/>
Neither of the McGuffeys was directly involved with these revisions. New<br/>
revised editions were published in 1841, 1844, 1857, 1866, and 1879. Major<br/>
changes included a gradual mellowing of the overt religious content of many<br/>
of the lessons. Still, in sharp contrast to the totally secular readers in<br/>
common use today, even the 1879 edition presented God as the Father and the<br/>
Creator.<br/>
<br/>
[And that last is a big selling point for the Christian fundamentlists.]<br/>
