<div id="ygrps-yiv-1031124839">Storm is passed, it&#39;s a blue sky day, and I feel fine.<br/>
 I have always been suceptible to motion sickness<br/>
readily, but just in the last few years started<br/>
getting really sick with barometric pressure changes. <br/>
I think they are both related to the inner ear.  So<br/>
anyhow, I have to get myself one of those weather<br/>
do-dads that tell the pressure changes, and be careful<br/>
of what I eat, and not go in the car if I can help it,<br/>
when it stormy.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of falling Sandra, I fell out of a tree (6<br/>
feet or so) when I was trimming it up in preperation<br/>
for dropping it here in our woods.  We are building. <br/>
Don&#39;t ask, it was really stupid.  Anyway, I was mostly<br/>
alright, having caught myself by hugging the tree on<br/>
the way down, and the cuts from the saw when it hit my<br/>
arm on the way down, and my other scrapes and bruises,<br/>
are almost all healed.  This was over a week ago now. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But I have one injury that is pretty bad.  I landed on<br/>
a root burl with my shin, there is this huge knot of<br/>
damaged tissue just below my knee, and the whole shin,<br/>
from ankle to knee is badly bruised.  I am gimping<br/>
around and all delicate, low stamina, low mobility. <br/>
The kids bump into me and I scream, taking pain pills<br/>
a lot, that sort of thing.  So I am totally<br/>
sympathetic to your plight.  Hang in there, remember<br/>
to rest as much as possible to let your body use the<br/>
energy to heal.  I keep having to remind myself and<br/>
the boys of that.<br/>
