<div id="ygrps-yiv-573601953">**Our 19 year old Nicole (will be 20 in spring) seems tobe lazy, or <br/>
depressed or something. She is fairly non-communicative, even when asked <br/>
direct questions,so it&#39;s hard for us to know what&#39;s going on with her <br/>
inside.<br/>
...<br/>
<br/>
She doesn&#39;t have any friends or any social life<br/>
outside of online...<br/>
<br/>
Nicole spends long hours at night on the computer<br/>
playing online games with people, until about 4 in the<br/>
morning.  She seems addicted to them to me. **<br/>
<br/>
This is a fairly accurate description of the long-term behavior of a husband of a friend of mine.  Would you guys be willing to look at the responses you&#39;ve given so far and adjust them for a father?  (In this case, I think depression is definitely an issue.)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard for me to come up with constructive advice, so I could use some input.<br/>
