<div id="ygrps-yiv-447055807">There&#39;s a site called lilaguide.com, &quot;real parents, local advice.&quot;<br/>
They&#39;re starting new lists and forums, and I figured I might as well  <br/>
get in on it.  There&#39;s money involved, because they draw advertising  <br/>
and have sponsors.  I&#39;ve tried to avoid money (and done too well for  <br/>
Keith&#39;s preferences, definitely), but this site is worth having a  <br/>
presence on because it will be lots of people&#39;s first exposure to  <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone here wants to go and help me introduce unschooling gently  <br/>
to new people, I&#39;d appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>
I do NOT want it to take away from this list.  This list is my online  <br/>
houseparty.  This is the good one.<br/>
<br/>
On lilaguide, if you review products and places (in the select  <br/>
cities?  Maybe you can add your city?) you earn Target gift cards.   <br/>
Now this might be absolutely worthless to some of you.  I don&#39;t know  <br/>
if Target stores even go into Canada.  And the first some (I forget  <br/>
if it was ten or twenty) who join get a $5 gift certificate to Target  <br/>
(so if you don&#39;t live near Target, maybe hang back  until tomorrow).   <br/>
Once in a while, I get money (probably Target gift cards &lt;bwg&gt;) for  <br/>
activity on the list or member count or something.  So I&#39;m selling  <br/>
out, but for a good cause.  New audience for unschooling, and maybe  <br/>
that list will support my (slight but steady) site expenses.  They  <br/>
don&#39;t mind us putting links to Joyce&#39;s site or mine; I already asked.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could think of it as missionary work.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the blurb and link from that site, and I&#39;m still learning how  <br/>
to use their set-up.<br/>

How can the joyful learning babies and toddlers do be carried through  <br/>
to adulthood? It&#39;s possible! This list is for discussing  <br/>
unschooling&#39;s potential to transform the whole family in wonderful ways.<br/>
