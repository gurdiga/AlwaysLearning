just different from brushing and shaving.  <br/>

I have a friend who jacked off her cat with a vacuum cleaner hose once.<br/>
I don&#39;t know if he finished.<br/>
<br/>
We had a dog once, a kind of really-thick-haired short wide sheepdog mutt <br/>
that was fairly common in NW New Mexico for a while.   In summers we&#39;d take her <br/>
to our neighbors who sheered their sheep, and the dog would get in line last <br/>
and get clipped.  Still, we could never see her skin at all, no matter how <br/>
short.  After the neighbors quit raising sheep, we took her to a &quot;beauty parlor&quot; <br/>
and the woman who usually did poodles (well not DID them, like with a vacuum <br/>
cleaner, but you know) clipped her and somehow tied little ribbons here and there <br/>
on her remaining...  it was like curly fur right at the base, but there was a <br/>
base coat like a mink, with another coat like an English sheepdog--long, and <br/>
a third kind of like a...  third dog had put another coat in there too.  <br/>
Freakish.  Enough hair/fur/to cover five or six dogs her size to an average/normal <br/>
covering.  Poor dog.  <br/>
<br/>
And her name was Awshoo (my baby mis-pronunciation of &quot;Lucy&quot;), so kids in the <br/>
neighborhood would go &quot;AaaaaaCHOO!!!&quot; and when she came they would say &quot;I <br/>
wasn&#39;t calling you, I was just sneezing,&quot; or some other lame variant of the same <br/>
clever joke, but the dog never once got that joke.<br/>
