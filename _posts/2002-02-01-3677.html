<div id="ygrps-yiv-57167185">I just wanted to thank all that posted about how they fit in in their<br/>
homeschooling groups- It helped me so much just to hear it.<br/>
<br/>
I went to park day today and had a great time- I am going to make more of an<br/>
effort to be friends with the two unschoolers there (I feel lucky they are<br/>
there now that some of you are in groups with no unschoolers :-)<br/>
<br/>
(oh gosh- the holy grail is still on- &quot;the holy hand grenade..&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
My son had a super good time too.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
Bronwen</div>
