&gt; Thanks so much for this link.  Even though I&#39;m a British person living<br/>
&gt; in America I didn&#39;t know that school wasn&#39;t compulsory in England.  I<br/>
&gt; always thought it was.  144,000 kids being homeschooled doesn&#39;t sound<br/>
&gt; like a lot but I guess it is when it&#39;s such a small country.<br/>
