that brings history to life, is fun to read and holds an energy filled <br/>

But - they don&#39;t HAVE to learn history, right? I mean, they&#39;re little  <br/>
and they&#39;ll learn a lot of history, eventually, by following whatever  <br/>
personal interests they end up pursuing. You don&#39;t need to make sure  <br/>
they learn history now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1269850846">I&#39;m also a lurker, here.  My daughter&#39;s 5, and so I&#39;m<br/>
mostly just soaking up information, squirreling it<br/>
away for when I might need it as she gets older.<br/>
<br/>
When we were researching educational philosophies and<br/>
considering whether to put her in preschool a couple<br/>
years ago, I especially loved the storytelling<br/>
approach that&#39;s found in the Waldorf schools -- where<br/>
the teacher (or, in this case, the parent) learns the<br/>
material, and then teaches through telling the stories<br/>
from memory, rather than out of a book.  It keeps the<br/>
information vibrant, and allows the adult to tailor<br/>
the angle of each telling to that particular group of<br/>
kids.  There are so many things I want Sarah to be<br/>
exposed to -- not necessarily to Learn the way she<br/>
would in school, but just to know that they&#39;re out<br/>
there if she wants to look more closely, to give her a<br/>
really wide, broad, *rich* base from which to start<br/>
her own explorations -- but there are so few resources<br/>
that address a broad topic in a way I like or that&#39;s<br/>
age appropriate.  Both in history and in science,<br/>
especially, I find that most books that try to cover a<br/>
broad amount of information give either so much detail<br/>
that it&#39;s overwhelming or gloss over so much that it&#39;s<br/>
painfully simplified.  So I read up on the topic<br/>
myself (using high school or college textbooks,<br/>
wikipedia, various library sources -- local librarians<br/>
have been great at pointing me at simple but thorough<br/>
and accurate books for background research), think<br/>
about how to turn it into a good story for her, and<br/>
the next time we&#39;re doing storytelling, I&#39;ll pull it<br/>
out.  If she&#39;s particularly interested in parts of it<br/>
and asks questions, either I look that up in more<br/>
detail for another time, or I track down good books on<br/>
that detailed aspect (I find it easier to find a<br/>
couple great storybooks on specific Native American<br/>
Creation stories than to find one great book on<br/>
comparitive religion for kids, for example).  And if<br/>
it doesn&#39;t interest her, maybe I&#39;ll tell the story<br/>
again a few months later to see if things have changed<br/>
or maybe I&#39;ll drop it entirely -- either way, though,<br/>
I&#39;ve broadened my own knowledge base.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Obviously working with one younger child is very<br/>
different from working with multiple older kids, but<br/>
maybe a similar approach would help you.  We love<br/>
reading aloud or telling stories at night, it&#39;s such a<br/>
great part of the rhythm of our days -- I&#39;d imagine<br/>
it&#39;s got to be hard to find books to read aloud that<br/>
would keep kids of different ages and temperaments<br/>
engaged.  Best of luck finding what you&#39;re looking<br/>
for!<br/>

Why books?<br/>
<br/>
Or novels that happen to be set in historical periods.<br/>
<br/>
What I think&#39;s wonderful for history, though is the fancy photo books, practically museums, Eyewitness to History and Dorling Kindersley books.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1641011420">In the line of Mr. Bean (well, Rowan Atkinson is in both, and I think <br/>
Richard Curtis directed both) is Black Adder. Fantastic history viewed <br/>
through a sardonic eye. And, if we come across something else, like the <br/>
workhouse down the road, I can place it in time in the context of Black <br/>
Adder for Simon and Linnaea.<br/>
<br/>
Television and movies are a brilliant way to explore history. One of the <br/>
books that I like looking through as a history book is David&#39;s dad&#39;s <br/>
Pictoral Book of Knowledge set. My brother picked up a set of the Book of <br/>
Knowledge at rural auctions in Western Nebraska and those are fun to look <br/>
through in comparison as well, both as they are different in time and as <br/>
David&#39;s dads are the UK series with Enid Blyton as an editor, there is a <br/>
different slant on the Empire on which the sun never set. It demonstrates <br/>
how human understanding of history and science and math and biology and <br/>
Empire all change with time and perspective.<br/>

Richard Curtis wrote Black Adder, I&#39;m pretty sure.  For anyone who hasn&#39;t seen those, you should, but skip the first season until and unless you really like the others.  It&#39;s not nearly the best.  British &quot;seasons&quot; of TV are way shorter than U.S. seasons.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I find that this kind of thinking gets in the way of seeing what my <br/>
kids are interested in exploring *already*. Now and then I think <br/>
about &quot;exposing&quot; one of them to something, but I&#39;ve learned to catch <br/>
myself at that point and examine *why* I&#39;m so invested in whatever-<br/>
it-is. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe its something I want to get involved in myself and just need <br/>
to admit that and not try to foist it off on the kids <br/>
as &quot;education&quot; - that came up today, actually. I was looking though <br/>
some books and came across a description of how engines worked and <br/>
thought &quot;Oh, I should show this to the kids, its a Valuble <br/>
Resource&quot;. A little warning light flashed in my mind. The kids were <br/>
happily engaged in other persuits, neither one of them is really <br/>
interested in engines right now, and if they were they would both be <br/>
happier taking one apart than reading about it. Hmmmm - I sat down <br/>
and read the book and felt better. <br/>
<br/>
Another of my not-so-great reasons for wanting to &quot;present&quot; <br/>
something to my kids is one of those bad old tapes saying &quot;this is <br/>
Important Information that Everone Needs&quot;. I&#39;m pretty good at <br/>
spotting those - they mostly sound like my dad ;) Here&#39;s one from <br/>
just the other day: the Backyardigans were singing a song around the <br/>
word &quot;eureka&quot; and Ray wanted to know what it meant. So I told him. I <br/>
think I even mentioned it was Greek. I thought about telling the <br/>
story of ol&#39;what&#39;s his name in the bathtub - I could even hear my <br/>
dad telling the story. But Mo wanted to sing the song and Ray was <br/>
busy on the computer. Neither of them was looking for more <br/>
information. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  but there are so few resources<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Who decides the information is overwhelming or oversimplified? Are <br/>
you looking at these books with your dd or on your own and deciding <br/>
*for* her? I&#39;ve looked at adult anatomy books and websites with my <br/>
5yr old - recently we&#39;ve been looking at adult chemistry and <br/>
biochemistry sites. She just adores drawings of molecules of all <br/>
kinds. One day we spent the morning doing an image search <br/>
of &quot;proteins&quot; and had a blast. Some of the information was waaaaaay <br/>
over my head, let alone a 5yr old&#39;s, but she was fascinated. <br/>
<br/>
That sort of learning can come directly from normal daily activity. <br/>
Mo wants to know what everything is made of right now: cats, organs, <br/>
muscles, cells, proteins.... That was a natural progression of <br/>
interest for her. My part wasn&#39;t so much that of &quot;storyteller&quot; <br/>
as &quot;librarian&quot; - I helped her find out where to look for what she <br/>
wanted to learn.<br/>

What about American Girls books?<br/>
<br/>
When my dd was 9 (and younger), she really liked them. The American Girl<br/>
&quot;History Mysteries&quot; and the &quot;Royal Diaries&quot; appealed to her, too.  Before we<br/>
moved to WA, we enjoyed many of the &quot;Dear Canada&quot; series books, and I<br/>
understand the &quot;Dear America&quot; books are similar.<br/>
<br/>
We really liked reading D&#39;Aulaires&#39; Book of Greek Myths (not history<br/>
exactly, but certainly &quot;classical&quot; &lt;g&gt;).  Easy to read aloud and understand,<br/>
but not dumbed down.  Some cool pen & ink illustrations, too.<br/>

I strongly recommend the American Girls historical collection of<br/>
books. I started reading them to our daughter when she was five or<br/>
six, she continued on with them, and for years her historical<br/>
reference points were, &quot;Felicity&#39;s time&quot; (Colonial) or &quot;Molly&#39;s time&quot;<br/>
(WWII). Those books  gave her so much!<br/>

Hi...Have you tried the &quot;Magic Tree House&quot; book series by Mary Pope Osborne?....We just started to read them to my DD (who&#39;s just turned 5) around Christmas  and we&#39;re already on book #20...My 8 yr old niece turned us onto them now my DD can&#39;t get enough of them...The two main characters, Jake and Annie (kids themselves) get to travel through time and around the world with the help of a magic tree house, books and a magical librarian by the name of Morgan le Fay...and they aren&#39;t bogged down with just facts, so then we look up more about what we have read about on the computer...even my husband looks forward to the next book and each book is only about 10 chapters so we can finish one in a couple of nights...I hope this helps.<br/>
