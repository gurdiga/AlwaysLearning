<div id="ygrps-yiv-495735371">&lt;&lt; As to Viggo...I could have some REALLY hot dreams about that man. He<br/>
is SO <br/>
completely sexy. wow. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s The Indian Runner, with a troubled, dangerous, tattooed Viggo. <br/>
Some naked bits if I remember.<br/>
Not a breathless, makes you tingly kind of naked, though. <br/>
The movie&#39;s disturbing but the acting is good. <br/>
There are some nice Viggo shots in the new Vanity Fair, if you get stuck<br/>
in a checkout line somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Deb L, who just rented &quot;A Perfect Murder&quot; again in order to look at<br/>
Viggo.   Oh, trivia!  Viggo&#39;s original artwork appears in that film.</div>
