Still sorting out reading )<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling experiences:  The boys have never been in schools.  They <br/>
have taken organized classes.  They have been to workshops.  They have <br/>
done workshops.   I read all ( the late) John Holt books, some before <br/>
the boys were born.  I read all Growing Without Schooling ( from # 1 to <br/>
the end), I read all( the late) Donn Reed&#39;s books, and lots more. <br/>
 We don&#39;t school.  If we use a text book it&#39;s as reference and by <br/>
choice.  We live, learn, argue, have great conversations, enjoy, play a <br/>
lot, travel, enjoy good food which we shop for, grow, cook together . <br/>
 In the next few days, we will be shopping for a new Home together. <br/>
 Each of us, five,  are different learner types, different <br/>
personalities. We tend to view ideas from different perspectives.  Makes <br/>
for lively discussions.  In 1998, I read Mary Griffith&#39; book &quot;The <br/>
Unschooling Handbook&quot; and thouht : &quot;Ah, Ah!  This is what we&#39;ve been <br/>
doing.  It does seem to have an official name&quot;...<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling Questions or Concerns:  University opportunity in Ontario <br/>
for home based learner ( not so good).  <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling Joys:  Blessings are understood in the background of their <br/>
absences.  When I compare my happy sons with teenagers on the streets... <br/>
I feel bless.<br/>
 But there are also these moments, I would like to trap in time:  Like <br/>
when the three of them played guitar in a concert last month ( they only <br/>
started to play last November );  or seeing them acting plays they  <br/>
authored; Or seeing the twins and one of their friend putting a whole <br/>
service for the fellowship  ( Philip was the service leader !  );  Or <br/>
listening to  Lewis discussing computer system configurations with one <br/>
of our specialist friend...( and our friend was awed by his knowledge, <br/>
which was way over my head )<br/>
  In other words, seeing them fit so well in life.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling does work.  It&#39;s learning with pleasure. An unschooler is a healthy life-long learner.  <br/>
