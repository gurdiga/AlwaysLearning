<div id="ygrps-yiv-213020895">Dear unschooling community,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m an unschooling mom from Germany, sending this out for an alternative school close that my son went to for 3 years:<br/>
<br/>
The alternative school in Wülfrath is looking for a young person (around 17  20 years old) who would like to come to Germany as a &quot;native speaker learning assistant&quot; from an English-speaking country for three months, starting around April 22nd. You would live with different host families whose children go to the &quot;Freie Aktive Schule Wülfrath&quot; and your job would be interacting with the children (6  10yo in the primary school and 10  16 in the secondary school), helping them with their school work in English and engaging them in different activities. You don&#39;t need to speak German, but will probably not be able to avoid learning some in the course of the three months. ;-) The school will pay an allowance of 75 EUR per full week of attendance, board and lodging with the German host families will be free. If you are interested in this experience, please let me know asap: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:mohsennia@...">mohsennia@...</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The school looks forward to hearing from you...<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>

people not on this list whose unschooling teens might be interested.<br/>

of course that&#39;s ok. Sorry, just saw your posting as I&#39;m not usually active in this group. Thanks!<br/>
