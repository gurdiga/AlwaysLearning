<div id="ygrps-yiv-1538393761">DARN IT!  I wrote a whole explanation in answer to this question,  <br/>
when it was clear in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
-=-It shouldn&#39;t be only parents of Down<br/>
Syndrome children who know what the term means.  Everyone should<br/>
know. -=-<br/>
<br/>
People should all know about Down Syndrome, not just parents of those  <br/>
children.  That&#39;s what I meant.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Same with bi-polar.  It doesn&#39;t hurt to know.  Same with<br/>
clinical depression.  It can&#39;t surprise you if you already know the<br/>
symptoms.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Everyone should know what those things mean and look like, rather  <br/>
than only thinking they need to find out more AFTER they&#39;ve had  <br/>
problems for a year or two and then found out what was different  <br/>
about their child.<br/>
<br/>
Knowing what all those things are doesn&#39;t label a child.  It&#39;s  <br/>
knowledge.  Unschoolers would do well to know as much as they can  <br/>
about what can hinder learning and human development, and what can  <br/>
help it.<br/>

===================================================(that was in  <br/>
response to)...<br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;m really confused. Some labels are okay, and some aren&#39;t? It&#39;s  <br/>
okay to say that a kid has Down Syndrome or depression, but not  <br/>
Asperger&#39;s or autism? This is the way people have been advocating  <br/>
that these labels be used - as tools for helping children, and as  <br/>
ways of knowing.<br/>
