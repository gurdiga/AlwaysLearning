<div id="ygrps-yiv-407226790">This is about &quot;knowing.&quot;<br/>
I pulled it out of the other response about the two questions, because that  <br/>
was long and this is off to the side of it.<br/>
 <br/>
There are people who will say they KNOW that children need structure and  <br/>
discipline.<br/>
 <br/>
There are people who say they KNOW in their being that there is a  heaven.  <br/>
Others KNOW in their being that life is suffering and we are  reincarnated many <br/>
times but counting them would be pointless and wrong,  so just be as virtuous <br/>
as you can be this moment and don&#39;t think about  the rest.  There are people <br/>
who know uglier things than those, and act on  them.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
-=-I know that if my child says he is hungry thirsty scared tired lonely  <br/>
bored, frightened, warm, cold, angry, sad, happy, jolly, full of fun,  <br/>
comfortable, not hungry, not thirsty and just plain OK then he is right and I  have no <br/>
right to question or contradict this.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Of all the statements in the original list, this is the one that I would&#39;ve  <br/>
chucked out as the least knowable.  Or maybe it just needs to be rethought  <br/>
and rephrased.<br/>
 <br/>
Here&#39;s another statement that does kinda contradict it:<br/>
 <br/>
-=-I trust that my children know what they are capable of and when they are  <br/>
able to do something. I know that they will ask if they need help not just in  <br/>
words but In signs that I must learn to detect. I know that if I am asked for <br/>
 that help I must ask what it is they want me to do and not do what I think <br/>
they  want.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Children will say &quot;not hungry&quot; when they are, for various reasons.   Adults <br/>
will say it for even more reasons.   Different people will  react differently <br/>
to that, but taking all statements at face value is to ignore  non-verbal signs <br/>
and even verbal signs the person was unaware of  providing.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-I know that if I am asked for that help I must ask what it is they want  <br/>
me to do and not do what I think they want.-=--=-<br/>
 <br/>
In unschooling discussions ALL THE TIME people think they want one thing  and <br/>
end up finding out they had asked a question that opened up all kinds of  <br/>
other areas of need.   Kinda like this very exchange.  Jay asked  two questions, <br/>
but they were a little window into a big area.  Someone  asked recently <br/>
whether offering a particular video game would be a good way to  lure her child home <br/>
from school.  The question seemed to be about the value  of that video game, <br/>
but no one could answer that simple question without asking  more questions.  <br/>
Why was the boy in school?  Couldn&#39;t she just get the  game and let him play <br/>
it even if he stayed in school?  (And many  other related questions came up.)  <br/>
What she wanted to know was  NOT &quot;is this one game good enough to lure a <br/>
schoolkid toward  unschooling?&quot;  That question was unanswerable.  Any &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; <br/>
 would&#39;ve been coldly worthless.<br/>
 <br/>
[Here I will refrain from going at length into Howard Gardner&#39;s writings on  <br/>
interpersonal and intrapersonal intelligences, but just will insert this <br/>
public  service reminder that some people have it and some people don&#39;t; with some <br/>
it  looms large, with some it&#39;s not a blip, others have a big blip or a <br/>
smaller  loom.]<br/>
 <br/>
A researcher (probably several-to-many by now) started collecting song  <br/>
lyrics about love to try to puzzle out what love was.  He was researching  <br/>
biochemistry and brain stuff.  But there are song lyrics and poetry with  huge clues <br/>
to what people have known for a long time.  <br/>
&quot;I feel it in my fingers, I feel it in my toes...<br/>
You know I love you, I always will; my mind&#39;s made up by the way that I  <br/>
feel...&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ll just quote the whole thing, and continue in another post:<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
     <br/>
<br/>
I feel it in my fingers, I feel it in my toes<br/>
Love is  all around me and so the feeling grows<br/>
It&#39;s written on the wind, it&#39;s  everywhere I go<br/>
So if you really love me, come on and let it  show<br/>
<br/>
You know I love you I always will<br/>
My mind&#39;s made up by the  way that I feel<br/>
There&#39;s no beginning, there&#39;ll be no end<br/>
&#39;Cause on  my love you can depend<br/>
<br/>
I see your face before me, as I lay on my  bed<br/>
I kinda get to thinking of all the things we said<br/>
You  gave your promise to me, and I gave mine to you<br/>
I need someone  beside me in everything I do<br/>
<br/>
You know I love you I always  will<br/>
My mind&#39;s made up by the way that I feel<br/>
There&#39;s no beginning,  there&#39;ll be no end<br/>
&#39;Cause on my love you can depend<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s written  on the wind, it&#39;s everywhere I go<br/>
So if you really love me, come on and  let it show<br/>
Come on and let it show <br/>

That &quot;she&quot; was me and what Sandra said it so true.  Though I asked about the<br/>
game, the inquiry wasn&#39;t at all about the game.  It was based on a fear; I<br/>
was scared that my son would not want to come back home after trying out<br/>
public school.  Though, after I asked the list I could tell by a few<br/>
responses that I was being silly and selfish.  I had to reevaluate things.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
(He was in public school because he wanted to try it out and I thought,<br/>
&quot;well, he&#39;ll either do very well and enjoy it or he&#39;ll realize that it isn&#39;t<br/>
all that he imagined it to be.&quot; Either way, we would win.  But, I was<br/>
starting to get scared that he wouldn&#39;t want to return home and I panicked!)<br/>
