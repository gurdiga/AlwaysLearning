<div id="ygrps-yiv-49308855">Since Sandra asked for happy/joyful unschooling stories: here&#39;s a very<br/>
small one from this morning with Leon (2y9m). I turned round to find him<br/>
carefully taking all the baubles off the tree and putting them back in<br/>
their box. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Could you leave them on the tree?&quot; I asked.<br/>
&quot;No, I&#39;m tidying them!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My immediate/automatic thought was to physically stop him and tell him<br/>
to leave it alone, and then I thought -- why? He&#39;s having fun, they&#39;re<br/>
not dangerous or super breakable, the tree is stable. He played with<br/>
them, in and out of the boxes, counting them and trying various ways of<br/>
packing them, for another ten minutes or so. Then a bit later when he&#39;d<br/>
moved onto something else I spent 2 or 3 minutes putting them all back<br/>
up again :)  <br/>
<br/>
Happy kid, happy parent. <br/>
