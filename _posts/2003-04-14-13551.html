<div id="ygrps-yiv-371206705">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to drop in to say that after over twenty years of <br/>
home/unschooling, and five kids that are functioning very well in the world, <br/>
thank you very much - my mom still doesn&#39;t get it.<br/>
<br/>
Me - talking about my soon to come book on our homeschooling experiences.<br/>
<br/>
Mom - maybe if I read your book, I&#39;ll finally understand what you do/did <br/>
about the kids&#39; learning<br/>
<br/>
Ah, somehow if she doesn&#39;t get it by now, I don&#39;t think the book will help, <br/>
do you?  :-)<br/>
<br/>
At one point she said - if I&#39;d have known about homeschooling, then I would <br/>
have done it.  I really doubt it, and she didn&#39;t need to - she can still feel <br/>
like a wonderful mother, which she is/was and just let it be!  After the <br/>
beginning, I just quit discussing it with her - I got so tired of her asking <br/>
me when I was going to sit the kids down and teach them.  We have always <br/>
lived a great distance apart, so that has helped.  And why do you have to SIT <br/>
to learn anyway??<br/>
<br/>
