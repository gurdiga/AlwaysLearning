<div id="ygrps-yiv-1707841933">In reply to the below:<br/>
 Tia I live in the Black Creek area which is in the Comox Valley.  I<br/>
have two daughters one is just recently 10 and the other is to be 12 in<br/>
a month.  We have been on the island for just about two years now coming<br/>
from central Alberta via a 2 year stint in Nelson, BC.  Thanks for<br/>
asking.<br/>

&gt;[] This conference by title sounds very interesting but I have never<br/>
&gt;heard of it.  I am obviously in the dark up here on Vancouver Island,<br/>
&gt;BC, Canada.  When is it? Where is it? What is the website as I presume<br/>
&gt;there is one?<br/>
&gt;Thanks<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-13264461">I agree it is great to hear from other Canadians Kerri!  From the way<br/>
things sound you certainly have a lively household and for certain you<br/>
are always learning together.  It sounds marvelous.  I am curious - do<br/>
you educate the foster children as well?  Also because you educate your<br/>
own do you have to adhere to the provinces curriculum guidelines in<br/>
order to satisfy the &quot;authorities&quot; ideas of &quot;good&quot; education?  I am just<br/>
and always curious! :)  I have thought about fostering children before<br/>
but at this time my home is too squishy for that idea.  <br/>

Nice to see other Canadians here!!<br/>
<br/>
I am in Ontario, Canada. Between Ottawa & Toronto. Except that I am VERY<br/>
rural being surrounded by all farmland near a small village. We live in<br/>
a<br/>
forest (in a house of course :)  )<br/>
<br/>
My brother & his wife & 2 children live near Vancouver. They are<br/>
&quot;mainstream&quot; though.<br/>
