<div id="ygrps-yiv-1216916211">Anyone who was thinking about this and hadn&#39;t decided, or anyone who&#39;s read this far and wondering WHY DIDN&#39;T I KNOW THIS? should know that today is the last day for getting the conference rate at the hotel. So if you&#39;re going to be thinking about it, maybe make a hotel reservation you cancel if you decide not to.<br/>
<br/>
The event is May 2-5 (2013, now/soon), and some families are staying the evening of the 5th.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a waterpark hotel NW of Minneapolis, and more information is here:<br/>

(not yet listed, Albuquerque between Christmas and New Year&#39;s; possible ALL event in late October 2014 in southern Californiaâ€”several of them are in 2014)<br/>

Deb Cunefare runs an announcements list of events in north America here:  <br/>

It started off for people who were travelling in RVs to events, I think.  <br/>
Some of those are better than others.  Read their sites and ask around if you&#39;re considering one.  <br/>
