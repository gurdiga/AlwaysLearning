<div id="ygrps-yiv-1225554535">I&#39;ve been unschooling for a year now.  I have two daughters 14 and 10.  <br/>
My 10 year old has completely changed during this year.  She went from <br/>
barely reading to devouring the complete Warriors series (more than one <br/>
time!!)and is now writing amazingly well.  Anyway, she is an introvert <br/>
and rapidly matured this summer both emotionally and physically.  This <br/>
summer she lost all desire to play with friends claiming that she <br/>
doesn&#39;t like to play the same things anymore.  She is content to read, <br/>
play on the computer and occasionally master a video game.  Has anyone <br/>
else experienced this with their kids?  Should I go out of my way to <br/>
provide activities for her and her friends (movies, bowling, trips to <br/>
the zoo) that would keep them connected?  We talked about it and she <br/>
seemed ok with that idea but I don&#39;t want to force something.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-5639330">Perhaps she would be interested in meeting people who *do* like to<br/>
play the same things that she does.<br/>
<br/>
As for the other things, going with what she wants seems like a nice<br/>
idea... but letting her know that you are happy to coordinate these<br/>
things might be helpful information for her.<br/>

oldest, 14, loves to be around other like minded people doing<br/>
interesting things, but she won&#39;t do it unless she likes the activity<br/>
and the people involved.  She&#39;d rather stay at home and read or be on<br/>
her computer.  Her first choice, though, would be doing something cool<br/>
with cool people.</div>

<br/>
Yes. All of them at one point or another.  They were only interested  <br/>
in their unschooled friends (who are still in their lives).<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Two things:<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t consider it &quot;out of your way.&quot;  I know it&#39;s a figure of speech  <br/>
but, what parents do for kids is square in the middle of the  <br/>
parenting road.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing is if she&#39;s happy you could morally let her be home  <br/>
and happy.  When she wants more she&#39;ll say so.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe do movies, zoo, etc. with her (just you and her maybe, or you  <br/>
and her and one other friend/relative) to  make sure she&#39;s out  <br/>
sometimes seeing new things.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-978023316">My 13 yo daughter has been experiencing the same thing in the last  <br/>
year or so. She is more than content to re-read every Warriors book  <br/>
written &lt;g&gt;, delve into other books that have been on her shelf and  <br/>
play on the computer. She plays WoW and is on deviantART, so connects  <br/>
with friends on-line.<br/>
<br/>
I noticed a couple of years ago that she was less interested in  <br/>
&quot;getting out&quot; to homeschool-group events, so we stopped. I also  <br/>
noticed that sometimes, even when she said she wanted to go, and I  <br/>
followed through with tickets or arrangements, she would want to bail  <br/>
at the last minute. So, since then, I have offered up things to do  <br/>
with and without friends. I mention possibilities more than once, but  <br/>
unless I see that light of excitement in her eyes, I don&#39;t assume I  <br/>
should nail it down.<br/>
<br/>
I would say (and so would she) that she&#39;s happier on her own at home.  <br/>
She can be who she is, grow at her own pace, and do the things she  <br/>
loves. She enjoys her friends generally one at a time (so I do my best  <br/>
to facilitate that) and those who share her interests, but also looks  <br/>
forward to our regional unschooling conference, in spite of the  <br/>
heightened energy. As she gets older, I see that she&#39;s growing into  <br/>
herself, being more comfortable with who she is, understanding herself  <br/>
better.<br/>
<br/>
When she was little, she would remove herself from situations that  <br/>
overwhelmed her. Then she went through a long period of seeking out  <br/>
stimulation (or at least not avoiding it) with not-so-great  <br/>
consequences for her or people around her. This happens less and less,  <br/>
but there are times still when she doesn&#39;t want to leave what&#39;s  <br/>
happening, then she&#39;ll become angry and frustrated. I realize that I  <br/>
needed to be more sensitive to this and not schlep us to so many  <br/>
activities. It can be a tightrope for us, because things can go off  <br/>
the rails, even when it&#39;s somewhere she *really* wants to be.<br/>
<br/>
She seems to know, even more so in the last few months, that when  <br/>
things get overwhelming for her, she needs to get away from what&#39;s  <br/>
happening. At the most recent conference, she often went back to the  <br/>
room to play her DS, or watch her Inuyasha DVDs, so she could get some  <br/>
space to calm down. She has the qualities of an introvert (needs lots  <br/>
of down time, gets her energy sucked out by too much excitement or  <br/>
dissonance), but can enjoy social time, too. A bit like her mum and  <br/>
dad &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
As she gets older, she&#39;s been able to articulate what&#39;s going on for  <br/>
her, too. We had a spell in which we had friends (whom we love dearly)  <br/>
come and stay for two days/nights at a time, within a week of each  <br/>
other. She told me that much as she cares for these friends, she was  <br/>
only able to handle one day/night visit at a time per week. So, that&#39;s  <br/>
filed for future reference. She is thinking ahead as to what might  <br/>
happen, is willing to try things, but also able to tell me how it went  <br/>
and how she sees things going next time.<br/>
<br/>
I have worried that I wasn&#39;t providing &quot;enough&quot; of whatever for her,  <br/>
but she&#39;s happy! And when she&#39;s not happy, it doesn&#39;t take long for  <br/>
her to get over it, since she&#39;s at home where she&#39;s loved and given  <br/>
space to do it.<br/>
<br/>
If your daughter is content, that&#39;s great. By all means, offer up  <br/>
ideas, especially ones that segue with her current passions, like  <br/>
renting &quot;Golden Compass&quot; or going to see other animal-focused movies,  <br/>
checking out some new computer games (does she know about the Warriors  <br/>
site?<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.warriorcats.com/warriorshell.html">http://www.warriorcats.com/warriorshell.html</a>  There are lots of  <br/>
Warriors fans on deviantART, too <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.deviantart.com/">http://www.deviantart.com/</a> <br/>
#catpath=fanart&order=9&q=warrior+cats), trips to the zoo. But don&#39;t  <br/>
make it necessarily a friend-related trip, just for the purpose of  <br/>
connecting her with her friends. She may really be wanting to  <br/>
experience things on her own, or with you or the family.<br/>
