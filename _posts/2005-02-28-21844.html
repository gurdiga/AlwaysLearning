<div id="ygrps-yiv-1791984351">Is there a Lori out there who belly dances and unschools? With a last name<br/>
that starts with Up? I was listening to a repeat show on NPR of Michael<br/>
Feldman&#39;s &quot;Whaddya Know?&quot; while weeding yesterday and he introduced a woman<br/>
Lori from the audience who UNschools and belly dances.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re out there Lori, I thought you represented us well. Simple, pointed<br/>
answers to Michael&#39;s slightly obnoxious questions. And I wouldn&#39;t have belly<br/>
danced for him either!<br/>
<br/>
Jacki, who was so pleasantly surprised to hear the word &quot;unschooling&quot; on an<br/>
NPR show</div>

things and lives in Chicago. Wish I&#39;d been listening yesterday!<br/>
