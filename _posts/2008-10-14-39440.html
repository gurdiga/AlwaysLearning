up on youtubes yet).  It seems though that a possible idea for a movie that<br/>
might be similar is Princess Mononoke.<br/>

influenced by anime. As was mentioned, Miyazaki movies are all  <br/>
wonderful. Here&#39;s some series that have a similar quest type flavor.  <br/>
They are more graphically violent than Avatar.<br/>
<br/>
Naruto<br/>
Inuyasha<br/>
Bleach<br/>
Fullmetal Alchemist<br/>
Rurouni Kenshin<br/>
Cowboy Bebop<br/>
Trigun<br/>
Samurai Champloo<br/>
<br/>
You might also try manga (the Japanese comic books). The first 5  <br/>
above all started as manga.<br/>
<br/>
Ranma 1/2<br/>
King of Thorn<br/>
Hikaru no Go -- Who would think a story about a boy wanting to play  <br/>
Go would be engaging? And yet it is! Very popular series and a huge  <br/>
influence on reviving Go in Japan.<br/>
Death Note<br/>
Shaman King<br/>
Yu-Gi-Oh!<br/>
One Piece<br/>

rating that you give Avatar.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what you are looking for in similarity, could you clarify?<br/>
<br/>
The newest Jackie Chan movie with Jet Li, the Forbidden Kingdom had a<br/>
lot of elements that reminded me of Avatar.  It&#39;s a really good movie,<br/>
it&#39;s obviously not anime if that is what  you are looking for more of. <br/>
The story is what reminded me of Avatar, some of the themes and<br/>
elements.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-84174361">You might want to check out the TV series &quot;Naruto&quot;<br/>
Plotwise, it is more martial arts oriented, but it has a similar mix of <br/>
action and humor.<br/>
<br/>
I think someone already mentioned the Studio Ghibli animated movies - <br/>
they are some our favorites!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1498524973">Naruto was the first thing that sprang to mind for me as well.   That<br/>
said, I think it depends on what you liked about Avatar and what you<br/>
think you would like to see in other shows.  I think that anime in<br/>
general is what you want, but there are lots of different shows.<br/>
Avatar is funny with a lot of physical humor.  It also has a<br/>
quest-like plot and a lot of action.   My kids like Avatar, but they<br/>
are pretty young and they like the episodes with the humor and goofing<br/>
off, not the plot or the battles... so for us going from Avatar to<br/>
Cowboy Bebop would be nuts :)  Princess Mononoke too... it&#39;s just too<br/>
dark for them and not what they like right now.<br/>
<br/>
So, I would recommend checking out Naruto and if you post and explain<br/>
more about what you like I can come up with some more names.<br/>
<br/>
Also, it took me a while to realize this but the guy who does the<br/>
voice of Ang also does the voice of Pablo (the blue penguin) in The<br/>
Backyardigans.  The American version, at least.  I looked on youtube<br/>
to find a sample and I found someone with an australian accent and<br/>
that is not him.  It&#39;s kind of fun to hear Ang singing&quot;Surf&#39;s up,<br/>
Surf&#39;s up, Ho daddy &quot;  :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Our whole family seemed to enjoy Avatar- the humour, the story <br/>
line/adventure/ quest, the battles for my boys in particular.  they <br/>
loved the way the elements worked together... the way the characters <br/>
cooperated and interacted.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the suggestions.</div>
