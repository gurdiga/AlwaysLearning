<div id="ygrps-yiv-837178879">Yesterday we visited a butterfly house with several other <br/>
homeschoolers.  One of the families was a strict school-at-homer that <br/>
told her daughter she could go on trips like this if she kept up with <br/>
all her studies.  In fact, they plan on doing extra work this summer <br/>
so the daughter can go on trips for *social* purposes.<br/>
<br/>
When I met this family, I was impressed with how well educated the <br/>
kids were.  The son will be going to high school next year and was <br/>
accepted into a very prestigious private high school because of his <br/>
test scores.  Of course, I was trying to find things wrong with what <br/>
they were doing but the kids seemed fine and did not seem to mind <br/>
doing the work.  The mother would always talk about how much the kids <br/>
liked doing all they did.<br/>
<br/>
So here we are having a nice time on our trip yesterday and one of <br/>
the mothers tells the school-at-home mother that she saw an email <br/>
from her daughter.  The school-at-home girl wrote &quot;maybe if my mom <br/>
doesn&#39;t *make* us pay attention to the butterflies, we can talk about <br/>
our play&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Gotcha!<br/>

kids, her parents (they were visiting) , me, and Tamzin.  We had <br/>
so much fun.  Tamzin was totally freaked out at the thought of a <br/>
butterfly landing on her though (remember her insect thing?).  <br/>
There weren&#39;t that many &#39;hatched&#39; yet, so it turned out to be a <br/>
non-issue.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1954636153">My 2 older dds (12,9) and a friend (12-ps) went to a talk and slide show by <br/>
the local butterfly club.  My girls both enjoyed it.  The 9yo had quite a <br/>
few questions (Is the butterfly population decreasing and how do butterflies <br/>
communicate? The last one had the presenter stumped.)<br/>
We plan on joining them on field trips to nearby places (and going alone <br/>
also).  I was very pleased that they were open to answering and discussing <br/>
my dd&#39;s ?&#39;s.  The psed friend thought it was the most boring thing in the <br/>
world!!!<br/>
Their Scout troop is planning a visit to a butterfly conservatory this <br/>
summer.<br/>
