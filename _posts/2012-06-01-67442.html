<div id="ygrps-yiv-1781640405">I need to clarify that what I bought to help my journey into unschooling was the record keeping book for unschooling, not for homeschooling!  That&#39;s what I said in my update post. I think it will help me to slide into what naturally feels right me but my mind tends to fight. I&#39;ve had my children home with me from day one over 26 years ago when I began homeschooling and I&#39;ve always &#39;felt&#39; like there was more, or something different and it has taken me this long to tap into what I felt all along.  That children can do this!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It might be Sara McGrath&#39;s &quot;Recordkeeping for Unschoolers&quot;. It&#39;s in  <br/>
journal form. It says it has information on meeting legal requirements  <br/>
and I hope she&#39;s provided links for each state. She&#39;s from WA.<br/>

Funny.  If it&#39;s the one I&#39;m thinking of, it&#39;s a fancied up (page-design-wise) version of some old advice I&#39;ve always attributed to you, Pam: to note what your child is:<br/>
watching<br/>
doing<br/>
listening to<br/>
thinking about<br/>
places they&#39;ve gone to<br/>
etc......<br/>

<br/>
How can you clarify it for us?  You were clear the first time.  But you are explaining to us all that you intend to take a step away from unschooling--that you intend to cling to school-at-home ways and means.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I&#39;ve always &#39;felt&#39; like there was more, or something different and it has taken me this long to tap into what I felt all along. That children can do this!-=-<br/>
<br/>
The children can&#39;t unschool while the mother is measuring and charing what they learn.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-154882009">Oh, that sounds like a good change for us for record keeping next year (or starting now). I do worry about keeping the state at bay, so I write stuff down, but that seems a great way to record in a way that is not all school-y. Awesome for a newbie like me. Is it on line somewhere, Pam?<br/>
