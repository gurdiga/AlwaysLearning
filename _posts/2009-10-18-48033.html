<div id="ygrps-yiv-1798517677">We just had Jayn&#39;s birthday party. As it turned out it was mostly a drop off party. There were 14 kids crammed into my little apartment and the age range was 4 through 12 with a few families, all but one visitor homeschooled or unschooled. All the parents strive to be mindful and kindly.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve just been writing a pangeric to the parents about the behavior of these splendid young people when their parents aren&#39;t there to see them. They were all very polite and pleasant to have around. The older sisters were especially sweet and kind to their younger siblings, helping them with crafts, food, drinks. They were all cheerful and willing. It was so very wonderful to see. <br/>
