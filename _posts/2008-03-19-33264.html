<div id="ygrps-yiv-871442468">For that to have been paraphrased &quot;are you sure she wants to learn?&quot;<br/>
is a huge jump, but to use quotation  marks on my words when my words<br/>
were (or could  have been and should have been) right in front of the<br/>
writer is<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    Quotation marks are to indicate the exact words of another person.<br/>
<br/>
======================================================================== <br/>
=================<br/>
The above was by me, and has a hole in it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I walked away to do something else and think of how to phrase what I  <br/>
wanted to say, and then posted without remembering I had pulled the  <br/>
end of that sentence.<br/>
<br/>
I had started to say &quot;criminal.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not &quot;criminal&quot; to go online and pretend to be someone you  <br/>
aren&#39;t, or to tell big fat lies.  That has been proven in court, in  <br/>
the case in which a girl&#39;s mother (or a girl pretending to be her  <br/>
mother or whatever) pretended to be a teenaged boy to lead on and  <br/>
then crush a neighbor, who killed herself.  No, the judge said there  <br/>
wasn&#39;t a law that had been broken.<br/>
<br/>
A reporter who misquotes can lose his job.   A witness who misquotes  <br/>
under oath can go to jail.  In a forum like this, though, dishonesty  <br/>
is not a crime.<br/>
<br/>
To take money after misrepresenting oneself?  That&#39;s not the same  <br/>
level of &quot;legal,&quot; though the morality matches.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been frustrated lately with a couple of (two or three)  <br/>
unschooling writers/commenters/speakers (not specifically all three  <br/>
nor great at those, and not on this list) who have misrepresented  <br/>
themselves in small or large ways.  It bohers me because I don&#39;t like  <br/>
dishonesty a bit.<br/>
<br/>
Go with ideas, more than with people.  If something makes sense and  <br/>
when you try it it&#39;s  helpful, DO IT.  If you can figure out a great  <br/>
way to describe your discovery or experience  so that others can have  <br/>
better lives and if you&#39;re willing to do that, wonderful!<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who&#39;s here just for excitement, I don&#39;t mind if you want to  <br/>
lurk and hope for fireworks, but don&#39;t build or light any.<br/>
Anyone who&#39;s here to be stroked and soothed and told you&#39;re doing  <br/>
wonderfully (regardless of what you write), it&#39;s not the list for  <br/>
you.  Search &quot;support lists&quot; and &quot;gentle&quot; at yahoogroups or google.   <br/>
You&#39;ll find some of the people who came here and were sure they could  <br/>
do better.  (Most aren&#39;t doing better and some aren&#39;t doing at all  <br/>
anymore.)<br/>
<br/>
Misquoting a person, using quotation marks is VERY bad writing, bad  <br/>
form, and in some situations potentially job-risking or illegal.   <br/>
It&#39;s not helpful, and it&#39;s not moral.  If you want to indicate that  <br/>
you think the person said that, or that they said something like  <br/>
that, then say so.    If you delete this mail and don&#39;t know how to  <br/>
get to the messages at yahoo, and you write &quot;I think she said,  <br/>
&quot;People shouldn&#39;t be  here to light fireworks&quot; that might be close  <br/>
enough, but as the message is still here and open, either quote me or  <br/>
don&#39;t.<br/>
