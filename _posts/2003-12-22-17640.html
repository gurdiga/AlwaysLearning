<div id="ygrps-yiv-1613862059">Someone posted not too long ago about their dd being bored.  We just <br/>
found some really cool online activities for girls who are into dolls, <br/>
make-up, and dress-up.  My dd&#39;s ages 7, 5, and 3 have totally taken over <br/>
my computer for about 3 days since we found all this and our fridge is <br/>
plastered with their printouts.  These are the sites-<br/>
http://www.barbie.com<br/>
http://www.pollypockets.com<br/>
http://www.what&#39;sherface.com<br/>
http://www.bratzpack.com<br/>
http://www.myscene.com<br/>
http://www.divastarz<br/>
<br/>
Even I have had fun doing making my own pictures on what&#39;s her face. <br/>
 Well, just a thought for any of you with girls wandering around saying <br/>
they&#39;re bored.  Good luck.  Heidi</div>
