<div id="ygrps-yiv-1121025510">Thanks to everyone who sent me data! I have 51 data points, and  (a bit surprisingly to me, to be honest!) so far the data is a perfect normal distribution/bell curve, with a median and a mode of 8.5 years, a mean of 8.02 years. Graph below (age on X axis)- I hope the copy/paste works. I&#39;m still gathering data from Sandra&#39;s site, too.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone can think of anything else they&#39;d like to look at in the data, let me know. I&#39;ll continue to add data as more comes in.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-680834924"><p dir="ltr">Sorry Jo if this is too late. I was meaning to reply but was trying to remember the exact age. I remember the moment so clearly but was trying to back track to work out exactly when it was. I don&#39;t know age plus months but it was pretty close to 7.<br>
Thanks,<br>
Niki</p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1286703460">Jayn came to absolute fluency by the time she was 11, but she was reading pretty well alone at 9. Split the difference? I&#39;ve been trying to find the post I made - either here or the Facebook group - about her suddenly reading something new aloud for the first time (and perfectly) and her choice of material being the user manual for the Alice computer graphics program. Seems like that would be a good pinpoint date - but I haven&#39;t found it yet.<div><br></div><div>It&#39;s interesting that her memory of how she started reading and my observations of her process are different. She doesn&#39;t really remember a time of not being able to read at least partly, and she recalls the period when she sounded out words from their letters very clearly. Whereas I recall the much longer period before that skill developed, of her recognizing whole words, and making good guesses at what words could be from the first letter and the context. Seems to me she always saw words in terms of whole syllables even when she was sounding out. It is really rare that she will pronounce a newly read word wrongly now (16).</div><div><br></div><div>Robyn C.</div></div>
