<div id="ygrps-yiv-1977016625">I am unable to stay on line long enough to access my Yahoo account.  We<br/>
are in the process of switching over to a new computer (and then brutally<br/>
murdering this old one with a sledge hammer) and I may or may not be<br/>
using the same server.  Could one of the lovely and kind moderators unsub<br/>
me, please?    I would appreciate it very much.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
Deb L</div>
