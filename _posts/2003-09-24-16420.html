<div id="ygrps-yiv-2031070504"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; my heart started beating really fast until she calmed down enough to tell <br/>
&gt; me she&#39;d hit a racoon. Sad and scary, but not nearly as scary as the stuff I <br/>
&gt; had flashing through my head until then. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Years ago when my former husband was in the USMC, a friend called to say <br/>
there had been a helocopter crash (former husb flew).  The time between him <br/>
telling about the crash, and saying it WAS NOT Russ was about 50 years!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve told that story so much the kids are now trained when they call:   &quot;Hi <br/>
mom, Everybody is FINE, there&#39;s been an accident!&quot;.  Not that we&#39;ve had that <br/>
many, but there have been a few of these type calls.<br/>
<br/>
My son Devin injured his arm very badly when I was hiking the Appalachian <br/>
Trail this summer.  I struggled to get back home to him, and we went through all <br/>
the trauma of having an injured child (even tho he&#39;s 24).<br/>
<br/>
His friend had crashed Devin&#39;s dirt bike a few months ago so Devin wasn&#39;t <br/>
riding.  Devin then had to sell his street bike to have money before the <br/>
disability money started coming in from the arm injury.<br/>
<br/>
Then he had a friend that gave him a golf cart, in exchange for money owed.  <br/>
Devin and his room mate were having a FINE time with it - where they live is <br/>
zoned for carts, and there are linked golf courses - <br/>
<br/>
UNTIL, &quot;mom we are fine --&quot;  They tipped the GOLF CART!  The room mate got <br/>
his head bumped, and Devin is at the dentist today for a root canal and a cap on <br/>
the chipped tooth.<br/>
<br/>
I HATE THOSE CALLS!!!<br/>
