&lt;&lt;&lt;-=-When Michelle was little, we played she was a  radio (guess you could<br/>
do it with an iPod now) and turned down her volume  knob. It was less<br/>
obtrusive than telling her to be quieter, especially when  she couldnʻt<br/>
(and maybe didnʻt want to &lt;g&gt;), really hear us  anyway.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I would half-cover my ears and cringe as though I was in  pain and <br/>
Marty would get quieter. &lt;g&gt; That one still  works.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

I took a  page from Pam Sorooshian&#39;s book and we say, &quot;Volume.&quot; Calmly and <br/>
without  emotion-though, sometimes I do need to raise my voice to be heard. <br/>
:~) I  have had more conventional homeschoolers look at me in amazement and <br/>
declare  that to be something &quot;incredible&quot;. :~D<br/>
 <br/>
If I&#39;m &quot;asked&quot;, &quot;Get me food!&quot; I usually comply while saying,  &quot;Please <br/>
would be nice to hear.&quot; in a gentle voice as a reminder. I  occasionally heard <br/>
my then-four year old saying it to his older brother.  :~)<br/>

Peace,<br/>
