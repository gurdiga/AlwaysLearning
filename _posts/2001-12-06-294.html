<div id="ygrps-yiv-1068187475">Here is a series of letters to/from the admisions office of a state <br/>
university (read from the bottom up). I figured they MIGHT be more &quot;on the <br/>
ball&quot;, but I was mistaken. This is the Bible Belt, and I&#39;m certain they&#39;ve <br/>
had a homeschooled student or two apply, if not be accepted.  But the <br/>
students are, for sure, Christianly schooled-at-home. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m planning to send each college/university (admissions office) in the state <br/>
an invitation to attend our Unschooling conference next October. I think they <br/>
need some idea of what to expect if an unschooler is interested in attending.<br/>
<br/>
Do y&#39;all have any ideas?<br/>

&gt; Hello!  We base a students acceptance on the GPA from the core courses that <br/>
&gt; we require and the SAT or ACT score.  We operate on a sliding scale, so <br/>
&gt; what the GPA needs to be, depends on the SAT or ACT score.  For a point of <br/>
&gt; reference, if the student has a 2.5 GPA, they need at least an 1100 SAT, if <br/>
&gt; they have a 3.0, they need at least a 1000 SAT and so on. The 20 core <br/>
&gt; classes required from high school are listed on our website <br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sc.edu/admissions">http://www.sc.edu/admissions</a> (freshman).  <br/>
&gt;   A lot of times students who are home schooled take their science labs at <br/>
&gt; a local college which would meet certification as long as the college is <br/>
&gt; accredited.  As far as someone not having taken labs at a community <br/>
&gt; college, receiving any grades, etc., I would need to ask one of our <br/>
&gt; directors. Please feel free to contact our Admissions Office <br/>
&gt; (1-800-868-5872, or 777-7700 locally) and let us know about your situation <br/>
&gt; and we would be glad to find out the answers for you.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; Thank you, but I was asking for more information than that. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Do you REQUIRE SATs? Do you REQUIRE so many years of a language/the <br/>
&gt; sciences/math/certain histories/etc?  What about portfolios? What about <br/>
&gt; real <br/>
&gt; life experiences? What about job experience? What about things that are out <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; of bounds for most schooled students? What about no tests and no grades? <br/>
&gt; How <br/>
&gt; do you deal with these kinds of differences? And how do you certify science <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; labs? Schooled and homeschooled and unschooled are very different. Are you <br/>
&gt; set up to deal with these differences in the application process? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is there someone in the admissions office that deals specifically with <br/>
&gt; applicants that are not traditionally schooled?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hello!  Basically, the student will need to meet the requirements for any <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; other student.  We would need to certify the science lab courses though.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>

&gt; &gt; What are your requirements for homeschooled applicants? <br/>
