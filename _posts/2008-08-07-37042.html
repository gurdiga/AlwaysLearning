<div id="ygrps-yiv-374448045">Wow! You guys gave me a lot of good game ideas. I will definitely be<br/>
checking some of these out with my girls. I actually have four girls<br/>
but two of them are my husbands from his first marriage. They are 11<br/>
and 9 (today is her birthday!)years old and they attend public school.<br/>
My other two are 6 and 4 (almost 7 and 5) and they stay home. Thanks,<br/>
again for all the advice and kind words.<br/>
<br/>
Dana</div>
