 </span></blockquote>How to handle situations like this is &quot;the million dollar question&quot;.  The choices are a)Let the kids learn to deal with this on their own with your coaching in private if necessary. b) Step in and deal with the kid yourself to help your kid out.  c) Either you or your kid tell the kid&#39;s mother if things become too difficult to deal with. <br/>
<br/>
The times I have gotten involved have not ended in a positive way.  So obviously for me this is not my first option.  When I&#39;ve let my kids deal with things themselves, they have handled things very well and usually we just discuss things after the fact.  This has worked well in most situations.  Virginia has learned to use humor when faced with bullies.  When she was in ps some girls started ganging up on her on the play ground.  One girl pushed her into a fence.  Virginia turned to her and said something like &quot;Oh, you want to dance, I love dancing&quot; and opened her arms wide to begin the dance.  The girls just walked away.  Later this girl told Virginia she was sorry and that she just wanted to be her friend.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if Virginia would have learned to handle things this well if I had stepped in.<br/>
She just has a way with people that I will never have.  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree. <br/>
<br/>
I think there&#39;s a balance thing here, too, though. There are some<br/>
situations where kids are disagreeing, maybe loudly or rudely, but they<br/>
also like and respect each other, and there&#39;s not a big power<br/>
disparity... and then I think it&#39;s often better not to offer help.  I<br/>
guess I figure the kids can always come and get me if they really want my<br/>
help mediating, and I trust that they will... although usually when they<br/>
come, what they need is a break from the situation, more than anything.<br/>
Then they almost always go back and find a solution that works for<br/>
everyone. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m realizing, too, that Cacie and most of her friends come form families<br/>
where interpersonal skills and harmonious resolution of problems through<br/>
talking is valued. Also  that when she was 5 and 6, things often didn&#39;t<br/>
get resolved so nicely, and playdates would end with the other  child<br/>
sticking out her tongue as she left and Cacie shouting &quot;I hope you get in<br/>
a car accident and die on the way home!&quot; I swear they&#39;re great friends<br/>
now, really...  she was awfully intense back then, they both were.  But<br/>
they were evenly matched, too, it was never one picking on another.<br/>
That&#39;s when it gets not-okay, I think, when one kid has the power...<br/>
<br/>
I had more of a problem learning *not* to step in at every sign of<br/>
trouble... when I was a kid, no one ever stepped in to help me, and I<br/>
probably overcompensate(d).<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I hope we are talking about different levels of bullying here.  And of course how the child feels about what is going on makes a difference.  Virginia never expressed fear in regard to the situation in school nor did she tell me she was being tormented.  She just told me how she handled this particular situation which I thought she had done a great job with.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve gone to bat many, many times for my kids when I felt it was in their best interest or they were afraid or traumatized by a situation.  I have also seen parents cause more trouble for their kids by stepping in before the kids had a chance to work things out for themselves.  I think the difference here is the degree of the problem, the child and whether the child even asks for help or not. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is an interesting connection.  I always thought that women that stayed in abusive relationships had low self-esteem.  Some how they have been given the message that they need to put up with crap.  <br/>
<br/>
In my examples of kids bullying other kids, I was not talking about *anyone* accepting the bad behavior just allowing the child to deal with the bully him or herself if they could or wanted to.<br/>
<br/>
I think the most important thing we can do for our kids is model standing up for our own rights as parents.  What do we do when there is a situation that is wrong that affects us or our family.  Our hero Eric did some leg work and brought the litterers to justice using the law.  He did not go chasing after the truck and pick a fight with them.  This was a great way to deal with the situation.<br/>
<br/>
We need to help our children understand what options they have in dealing with their problems just like we as adults have our own options.  Harassment can be a real problem for adults as well as children.  Adults say mean and hurtful things to each other just as children do. I don&#39;t see a child&#39;s world as that much different than an adult&#39;s.  They have rights just like we do and they need to learn how to use their rights and *assert* themselves.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;If they could or wanted to&quot;  is an important point I think.  Our kids<br/>
will have to learn how to deal with all kinds of people, to be sure and<br/>
it&#39;s good when kids know they have a right to stand up for themselves.  I<br/>
think most kids can and want to deal with normal personal conflicts in<br/>
their own way.   I was thinking of the habitual bullying that goes on at<br/>
schools and in neighborhoods sometimes, not even necessarily physical,<br/>
that most kids really don&#39;t know how to deal with and shouldn&#39;t have to<br/>
on their own.  When a parent says, just stay away from that kid, it<br/>
doesn&#39;t really help,  because bullies are aggressors.  When kids go to<br/>
parents or teachers they sometime are asked, - what are you doing that<br/>
can be setting him off? -   When someone is bent on tormenting you *tell<br/>
him to leave you alone* is not helpful.  Kids need real help with this<br/>
kind of thing and lots of them aren&#39;t getting it, because for some reason<br/>
we&#39;ve come to believe it&#39;s all a normal part of childhood.   <br/>
<br/>
I was really amazed at the news coverage of a school shooting in CA. <br/>
Every student at the school who was interviewed knew the shooter had been<br/>
picked on for years and every teacher and school official denied knowing<br/>
the kid was having that kind of problem.   Even when a situation doesn&#39;t<br/>
get to that point, kid victims of bullies often carry that emotional<br/>
baggage around with them for years.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t mean to suggest anyone on this list was neglectful if they<br/>
weren&#39;t straight jacketing obnoxious little neighbor kids. ( But it<br/>
sounds like fun ) <br/>

<br/>
Also what type of bullying would you not consider serious enough to call the police about but would feel the need to get involved in?  What have you done and how has it worked?<br/>
<br/>
My experience has been that the bullies and their families have serious problems.  Talking to the parents of the bully generally will not work because they either bully their own child, encourage bullying because it shows strength (huh?), or the kid is being bullied by someone else and the parents aren&#39;t helping.  It is a very tough situation to deal with.  My personal feeling is that if my children are ever seriously bullied in the future and we can&#39;t resolve it, I will get the police.<br/>

Stir things up!!!! There is obviously some serious mental <br/>
problems going on here. Possibly they are being abused by <br/>
parents or someone else they know. I read a very interesting <br/>
article once (sorry, can&#39;t remember where it was) about <br/>
psychological studies done on mass/serial killers. Every single <br/>
one of them in the study (I believe they studied 50 of them) <br/>
started out by abusing and killing animals. Then they moved <br/>
onto humans. It sounds like these boys have already started on <br/>
humans. It may be in everyone&#39;s best interest if you contacted <br/>
CPS or similar (anon of course).<br/>

&gt; There is a very serious situation brewing in our little <br/>
community.  Three<br/>
&gt; boys, the son&#39;s of a Jr.high school teacher are getting away <br/>
with hurting<br/>
&gt; kids at school.  The littlest one, a big boy actually, in second <br/>
grade<br/>
&gt; hurt a girl on the playground a few months ago.  He hit her and <br/>
knocked<br/>
&gt; her down, tried to stab her with a stick and bit on the back of <br/>
her thigh<br/>
&gt; hard enough to draw blood.   <br/>
&gt; These same kids have been in trouble for cruelty to animals <br/>
and when the<br/>
&gt; authorities didn&#39;t want to do anything to them the animal control <br/>
warden<br/>
&gt; quit her job after catching them raiding birds nests and using <br/>
the baby <br/>
&gt; birds as fishing bait.  They hung their neighbors cat from her <br/>
clothes<br/>
&gt; line.  Some parents have taken their kids out of school and <br/>
others are<br/>
&gt; threatening to sue the school district if their kids get hurt <br/>
because the<br/>
&gt; school is doing nothing to keep them safe.  What are the <br/>
parents doing? <br/>
&gt; No one wants to stir things up.<br/>
