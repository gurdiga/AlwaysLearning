<div id="ygrps-yiv-1637791000">&quot;  It might be something the child would be <br/>
interested <br/>
in as well.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ok, assuming the mother was doing something really interesting, why would the child be saying &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot;? Wouldn&#39;t they be saying &quot;Mom, can I join you?&quot;<br/>
And why did the child find something else to do within three minutes if what the mother was doing was interesting?<br/>
It sounded like the mother was inviting them to help with her work (fine, in and of itself) and the child was obviously not interested,so found something else to do.<br/>
<br/>
I see nothing wrong with a parent inviting the child to help with something, but if it&#39;s housework and the intent is to get a child to quit saying &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot; then there are MUCH more compassionate ways to handle this.<br/>
<br/>
I know households less chaotic than mine, most of them are very controlling. The kids know that certain behavior is off limits and they act in a very docile, obedient manner. Very polite, well-mannered UNTIL the parents aren&#39;t in the vicinity!:)<br/>
<br/>
I think when a child says they&#39;re bored, it&#39;s our chance to brainstorm with them. Obviously if I offer to help them think of something and they turn me down, it&#39;s a whole different story. But I&#39;ve never had that happen. My kids don&#39;t get bored very often, and if they do it means &quot;Mom, will you help us think of a cool project to do?&quot;<br/>
Funny thing is, when I offer a bunch of options they usually come up with their own idea anyway. Sometimes we just need a person to bounce thoughts/feelings off of. I want to be their sounding board, not someone that tries to make them never say &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot; like my parents did.<br/>
