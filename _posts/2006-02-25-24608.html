I normally read and learn here at this group. I felt a need to respond to <br/>
this one. Your responses always seem to be fair, &quot;gracious,&quot; and logical .....and <br/>
sometimes I get a chuckle from the things you say.:o) For me, this is all of <br/>
the above. What we do IS funny compared to school! We&#39;re laughing WAY more <br/>
than when the kids went to school! I am enjoying the wealth of knowledge from <br/>
your website also.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

I was into the fourth line of what you wrote below before I knew it  <br/>
wasn&#39;t building up to &quot;But this time you&#39;ve gone too far; you suck!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
I was relieved. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And you&#39;re welcome for that website.  I have a lot of fun with it and  <br/>
I&#39;m grateful to the dozens or over a hundred people who have said  <br/>
&quot;Sure! Cool!&quot; when I asked if I could enshrine something they had  <br/>
written there, and to the other several dozen who were told after the  <br/>
fact and didn&#39;t say &quot;No way, pull it&quot; and even to those who&#39;ve  <br/>
written goofy stuff I wouldn&#39;t pull if they got a lawyer to come to  <br/>
my house (that would be this page: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/strew/ifilet">http://sandradodd.com/strew/ifilet</a> )<br/>
I didn&#39;t name them, and many-to-most have changed  their views since  <br/>
then anyway.<br/>
