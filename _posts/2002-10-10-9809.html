 </span></blockquote>I want to be your neighbor! (the kids and I are spending the day reorganizing <br/>
book shelves :o( boring!) <br/>
<br/>
Our neighbor once had the nerve to come over and tell me that it wasn&#39;t fair <br/>
that my kids got to play outside during the day. I asked why it mattered to <br/>
her, her kids are in school all day. She told me that every time they are at <br/>
home on a parent teacher conference day or other holiday from school, they <br/>
see my kids running around playing. Since she was at work, her kids had to <br/>
stay inside until she got home at 5, and they spent the day calling her at <br/>
work asking to play outside. This of course is very disruptive to her work <br/>
day and she doesn&#39;t want to have to deal with it. I had suggested that she <br/>
let the kids come out to play, I was out with the kids, they would have fun. <br/>
She, very meanly, told me, she didn&#39;t want her children getting the idea that <br/>
hsing is fun. :o( She then told me she had gone to great lengths to tell her <br/>
kids that Moly and Jack had to do all the same things they did at school, all <br/>
the bookwork and tests and that them seeing ours out disputed that idea in <br/>
her kids heads. So I told her hsing didn&#39;t have to be that way, my kids don&#39;t <br/>
have bookwork or tests, my kids are free to play and be kids. She sent her <br/>
kids home too, after hearing me say that. <br/>
<br/>
Since then, her children have come over often, asking questions about hsing. <br/>
They are very curious about our lives, and how Moly and Jack learn to read <br/>
and do things like math and science. (Moly said she wished they would get the <br/>
idea and just play, since she isn&#39;t too fond of feeling like a monkey in the <br/>
zoo.) It is a constant source of wonder when I explain that we don&#39;t divide <br/>
our learning into groups like math, reading, and science. When they see Moly <br/>
reading about the human body and playing with her models, I hear things like <br/>
&quot;We don&#39;t get to learn about that until high school.&quot; When they see Jack <br/>
reading a book with chapters, the youngest Jack&#39;s age, made a comment that <br/>
she didn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; to read *chapter books* until next year. (Jack wanted to <br/>
know what a chapter book was.) Many times I have had to sit and explain that <br/>
I have never grouped books into categories like chapter books. They are <br/>
amazed that my kids can read and write. By the things they say, I am sure <br/>
their mother has gone to great lengths to get them to believe they would <br/>
never learn by just being kids. :o(<br/>

unschooling days than any &#39;ole neighbor. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1640494240">I loved reading this!! We live in the city -- and sometimes I get a little weirded out about certain puddles (such as the ones with car fluids floating on top)....but mostly I let dd jump away! About a week ago, I drained all the water from her swimming pool. Dd proceeded to get her water boots on and splashed around wildly in the street as the water flowed down to the storm drain. My neighbor came out, made a face, and stated (angrily) &quot;Ach! That water is dirty! Why are you letting her jump in dirty water?&quot; I informed her that my daughter was having fun and does take baths.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up in a small town with a big back yard. My fondest memory of being a little kid is playing in the dirt, stomping in streams, puddle jumping....basically we loved anything that involved getting totally filthy. I will never deny my daughter similar opportunities!<br/>
