<div id="ygrps-yiv-17949647">Cakes meet book worship.<br/>
<br/>
I have webpages on cakes and book worship, and lots on medieval  <br/>
interests, but this one takes the cake to a whole new level!<br/>

I was disappointed at first that it wasn&#39;t REALLY &quot;medieval cakes.&quot;   <br/>
I was hoping for research on that.  I know some about pies, but  <br/>
little about cakes.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not medieval cakes.  It&#39;s cakes done up with medieval book art.<br/>
<br/>
Keith sent the link.  I guess I should go and put it on the book  <br/>
worship page and the cake page now! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
