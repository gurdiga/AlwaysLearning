I&#39;m sure there will be a few comments from people who posted before they saw <br/>
this, or who will miss this and come upon the other stuff later.  But it&#39;s <br/>
not being helpful at this point, I don&#39;t think.<br/>

Sandra, whose list is supposed to be nicer<br/>

&lt;&lt; &gt; Comments like Tucker&#39;s do not come out of hatred but out of <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ignorance. She wants to the right thing but she still cannot go past <br/>
&gt; the &quot;all the people her color/race/culture as money from me&quot; because <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1891594538">Sandra, Tucker and all,<br/>
<br/>
As I said before, my comments were not just about Tucker but about <br/>
the unconscious ways WE ALL relate to people through language. They <br/>
are real and because they are unconscious to some, people may not be <br/>
aware they are saying things that have a different meaning than <br/>
intended.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds esoteric and perhaps my point did not come across too well. <br/>
My apologies for not being more articulate. As I said, this is about <br/>
US and I include myself in the process.<br/>
<br/>
Which BTW takes me to one particular distinction. This is not about <br/>
being politically correct. Becoming aware of how we use language in a <br/>
certain way is about listening. My point was that there is nothing to <br/>
do. Add to that there is nothing to be. Just try listening.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
