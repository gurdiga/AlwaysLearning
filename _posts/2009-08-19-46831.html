<div id="ygrps-yiv-249624102">This seems to be one of the biggest concerns I hear: My child must learn to write book reports, essays, and research reports in order to do well in college or even a job.<br/>
<br/>
It used to be a big concern of mine too before I really understood and started living unschooling. The irony of that belief was that I did not do so well with writing when I was in school. Yet in college, I found ways to manage. It&#39;s not rocket science to follow a pattern. Some people just don&#39;t think it&#39;s a skill that should be left to the child, even in an unschooling environment.<br/>
<br/>
I have heard a few people say they were unschooling except for the necessities such as math skills, reading comprehension, and writing (as in composition not handwriting). <br/>
<br/>
My children are doing quite well writing things they want to write.  My son Jeffrey (13) makes lists of video games and writes up reviews.  He hasn&#39;t felt comfortable posting them to the various game sites he reads though he talks about doing it some day.  He&#39;ll either do it later or not do it.  I can&#39;t imagine making him do that just to teach him a lesson.  My daughter Allie (11) likes to write song lyrics and stories.  She can work on one story for months.  I don&#39;t ever tell her she needs to keep it a certain length or critique it to fit some arbitrary guidelines to prepare her for high school or later.  I am positive she&#39;ll figure out formal writing when she needs to do so.<br/>
<br/>
These thoughts have been going round in my head since I read some posts on a homeschooling board. People get so worked up.  I&#39;m so thankful I was able to learn to move past those hang-ups, even though it took me quite a long time. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-413937090">You can be disappointed that you haven&#39;t found kindred spirits, you can be<br/>
disdainful of their use of unschooling to promote themselves as hip<br/>
happening homeschoolers or you can just shrug and move on...I too am<br/>
struggling with this idea when someone introduces themselves as an<br/>
unschooler.  It sets up expectations for a path of life learning in freedom<br/>
and mutual respect between parents and children. Who wouldn&#39;t be happy to<br/>
find a community of like-minded people?  I am learning to just ignore the<br/>
self-identification and decide whether I am going consider people<br/>
friends/colleagues by using other criteria.  Are they a thoughtful, kind,<br/>
gentle person?<br/>
<br/>
There are enough of us striving for freedom, and respect in our lives:<br/>
attempting to live in love peacefully and joyfully with our kids!  I think<br/>
just sorting through information is the skill of the future--learning to<br/>
discern and to shut out contradictory voices, rather than memorizing them by<br/>
rote or regurgitating them!.  Learning to live and negotiate the world by<br/>
looking at other things other than labels is a great gift to our kids and<br/>
something they may choose to emulate or learn from watching you!<br/>

Yes.<br/>
And if anyone here is getting the alerts or bulletins from any groups  <br/>
who make money telling people the sky is falling, that would be  <br/>
another thing to click &quot;unsubscribe&quot; about.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes people who are fans of talk radio or political discussions  <br/>
think this list is blowing sunshine up people&#39;s butts, but here&#39;s the  <br/>
deal:   Those &quot;oh my Lord, can you believe this!?&quot; outfits are blowing  <br/>
fear up  people, and into their eyes and ears and dreams.<br/>
<br/>
Fear doesn&#39;t bring you closer to a state in which learning can take  <br/>
place.  Fear doesn&#39;t improve your relationship with your child.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-730164918">Occasionally over the years I&#39;ve brought unedited samples of my kids&#39;  <br/>
writing. It wasn&#39;t to show off, and it wasn&#39;t to violate their privacy  <br/>
or any such thing.  It was to show that kids without lessons in  <br/>
grammar or spelling or composition could write.  But I forget that not  <br/>
everyone has taught Jr. High English and has a headful of random  <br/>
samples.<br/>
<br/>
So Alan&#39;s point is good.  If you don&#39;t know what to compare your kids&#39;  <br/>
writing to, it might be easier to worry.<br/>
<br/>
But to be fair, I write easily.  My kids are easily verbal.   <br/>
Undoubtedly there&#39;s an element of &quot;verbal intelligence&quot; (Howard  <br/>
Gardner term) involved.  Genetics.  Environment.<br/>
<br/>
School probably would not have made them better writers.  But I&#39;m here  <br/>
to explain semi-colons and hyphenated adjectives, and two of the three  <br/>
have asked about that, and understood it (being in a 1:1 student/ <br/>
teacher ratio &lt;g&gt;).  Marty, genetically more like his dad, has not  <br/>
inquired about these subtle details of written English.  But when  <br/>
Keith was Marty&#39;s age he wasn&#39;t much of a writer either, though he had  <br/>
finished high school and two years at the university.   Keith writes  <br/>
well now, and Marty might too someday, but it&#39;s a small part of Marty  <br/>
one way or the other.<br/>
<br/>
The other day in a side e-mail someone (who should remain anonymous;  <br/>
no responses needed) wrote this to me, about unschooling discussions:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;it would take me much longer to try and compose my thoughts like i&#39;m  <br/>
having to write an essay in high school. no thanks. not me. i&#39;d rather  <br/>
just spit it out...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I could take that statement down to its elements, but the point for  <br/>
this is that some people do have haunting memories (nightmare  <br/>
memories, some) of &quot;having to write an essay.&quot;  I don&#39;t think of this  <br/>
kind of writing as &quot;essay writing&quot; at all, so I&#39;m sorry some people  <br/>
have those wounds.  Having taught English in a public school, I cannot  <br/>
escape having been one of the wounders.  Here&#39;s what I wrote about that:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/gill">http://sandradodd.com/gill</a><br/>
<br/>
But back to this haunting problem:  Even though it&#39;s harder for some  <br/>
to write than others,  not every list member needs to write.  Most  <br/>
don&#39;t; most just read.  For those who do choose to write, though, I  <br/>
want them to put thought into it.  I don&#39;t want them to just urp up  <br/>
whatever they&#39;re thinking.  It doesn&#39;t need to be &quot;an essay&quot; to be  <br/>
carefully chosen words.<br/>

wether you agree with them or not.  I mostly avoid the local homeschool<br/>
message boards.  I check them regularly to look for activities and law<br/>
updates, but I don&#39;t read or respond to posts other than those posts<br/>
that I specifically look for and even those ones, I don&#39;t respond to.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like all the fear and worry presented by curriculum users, or<br/>
even eclectic homeschoolers, or relaxed homeschoolers.  I love<br/>
unschooling a LOT.  I want to protect it&#39;s precious place in my life and<br/>
the life of my family.  Anything that I choose to explore along the<br/>
homeschooling lines had better be in the direction of making unschooling<br/>
better and anything that makes it worse can get thrown out the window or<br/>
into the garbage.  I don&#39;t have time or energy to put into even reading<br/>
or thinking about someone else&#39;s fear about why their kids need<br/>
&quot;whatever it is they need&quot; for the parents to relax and be happy.  I get<br/>
enough of it, just living life without seeking it out!</div>

 <br/>
What constitutes good writing&#39;s pretty subjective anyway.  Some time  ago, <br/>
I heard about an experiment in which someone sent a passage of D H  <br/>
Lawrence&#39;s more purple prose to one of those &quot;Make Pots of Money from Your  Creative <br/>
Writing&quot; courses.  It was made to appear as if  it came from the pen of an <br/>
ordinary writing student.  From  what I recall, the critique they received <br/>
was that the prose was clumsy,  repetitive, overblown and slightly <br/>
disturbing. ;-)  <br/>
 <br/>
From what I&#39;ve seen here in England, schools teach  <br/>
essay-writing-by-numbers.  It&#39;s an approach that gets the results you&#39;d  expect - usually you&#39;d <br/>
find more of interest in a shopping  list.<br/>

Formula essays are sometimes the only way to turn out an essay that you<br/>
had no interest in writing in the first place.  That would make for bad<br/>
writing, I&#39;d think!  It&#39;s a compelling argument for not forcing writing.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone here has read StarGirl by Jerry Spinelli, there is a very<br/>
beautiful part of the book where she writes a speech, but she doesn&#39;t<br/>
really write it at all, she fills her head with it and speaks.  I won&#39;t<br/>
say anymore in case people want to read the book.  It&#39;s a wonderful<br/>
unschooling story!   The character in the book, did that sneak up on you<br/>
thing.</div>
