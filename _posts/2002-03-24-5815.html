<div id="ygrps-yiv-2057066493">Has anyone found it necessary to have a child take the GED Test? <br/>
Maybe to get into college, satisfy state regulation, employer, or <br/>
nervous relatives? :)<br/>
<br/>
When I first checked into it and read that you only have to score a <br/>
45 out of a possible 80 on each of the five tests I thought ... this <br/>
should be easy!! But after looking at a book with very thorough <br/>
practice tests and answers I&#39;m not so sure it would be that easy <br/>
(without many hours of teaching to the test anyway) but then I find <br/>
myself wondering What&#39;s the point? This stuff looks good on paper, <br/>
but who really cares!!! I don&#39;t see a lot of real life questions <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
But then again I say to myself, this is a minimum knowledge <br/>
base....shouldn&#39;t my kids at least have that?<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

I have heard from several sources that if a child is college-bound, the GED <br/>
is a bad idea. Too much stigma attached.<br/>

GED in order to enter some community colleges is fine.  By the time you have <br/>
your Associate Degree and move on to a four-year college or university, how <br/>
you got there is pretty much forgotten.  Some folks are able to get into <br/>
community colleges without a GED and that is probably the preferred route, if <br/>
possible.  <br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine organized a Homeschoolers College Night a couple years ago <br/>
held in the conference rooms of our public library.  She invited reps from <br/>
various colleges in the area, community and four-year, as well as military <br/>
recruiters and tech school reps.  They were more than happy to come and <br/>
present their sales pitches &lt;g&gt; and answer all the many questions <br/>
homeschooling parents had regarding getting their kids into area colleges.  <br/>
It was informative and really rather easy to coordinate.  <br/>
