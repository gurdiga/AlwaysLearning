<div id="ygrps-yiv-1674768598">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I can not keep up with the amount of the post in this list.  But as an<br/>
unschooler I keep myself subscribed to the list.<br/>
<br/>
Recently I was assaulted by a feeling that I need to get myself ready to<br/>
educate 9 yo dd on sexual abuse, rape, teenager&#39;s pregnancy.  (I feel that I<br/>
am ready to discuss any of these subjects with her.  I have never hidden<br/>
myself fm menstruation and that  subject she already knows well.)<br/>
<br/>
The best idea I could come of how to educate myself and then pass that to dd<br/>
was to read subject literature directed to teenager and make them available<br/>
to dd. I would appreciate any advice on how and where to begin my education.<br/>
Pls let me know you advice on the must read books&#39; list.  Thank you.<br/>

<br/>
Maybe just bring things up as they come up naturally, from news stories or <br/>
movies.   <br/>
<br/>
There are websites with information and those are as available in Japan as <br/>
anywhere, though any books people might recommend here might not be.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe your self-education about such things could be aided by a google.com <br/>
search with terms like <br/>
<br/>
adolescent female menses reproduction STD safety <br/>
(not all of them, but two or three at a time?)<br/>
<br/>
You will have to wade through some stupid stuff, and some propaganda, but <br/>
I&#39;ve seen good sites out there.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone here have a link of something a mom could read before talking to a <br/>
daughter?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I wrote to a homeschooling friend of mine, Ginny Hunt, who is quite<br/>
knowledgeable about these topics, and posed your questions.  Her response:<br/>
<br/>
