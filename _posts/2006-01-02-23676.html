<div id="ygrps-yiv-1602486536">&quot;The ways we were raised can tend to influence how we react, but that<br/>
neither makes right nor excuses the decisions we make. Yelling so<br/>
often seems to come out with our having never once thought of it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was raised by a &quot;yeller&quot; too...my Mom.<br/>
It&#39;s a natural reaction for me, but it rarely happens any longer. If <br/>
I start to raise my voice now, I usually catch myself and start <br/>
talking quieter, or just stop altogether.<br/>
<br/>
The steps to mindful parenting are something I discussed with Sandra <br/>
in our talk at the conference. It&#39;s different for everyone, but <br/>
until I accepted the philosophies of unschooling wholeheartedly, <br/>
until I saw children as whole and perfect and doing the very best <br/>
they can at every moment, the gentleness couldn&#39;t take hold.<br/>
<br/>
The way to peace is just to BE peaceful..it&#39;s that simple. There is <br/>
no remedy, there is no exact science to it, you just act peacefully <br/>
and you will begin to feel peace. The path to peace is peace.:)<br/>
<br/>
Simple, and difficult.<br/>
<br/>
Zen buddhism and unschooling were the most useful tools I ever <br/>
picked up.<br/>
