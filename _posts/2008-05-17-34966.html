<div id="ygrps-yiv-788552339">I had e-mail from someone asking about dyslexia and boys and she and  <br/>
her husband insisting on the three R&#39;s and kids could go their own  <br/>
speed and didn&#39;t have to be tested but...<br/>
<br/>
So I responded:<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m sorry, I can&#39;t encourage you to almost or kind of unschool. By<br/>
&quot;insisting&quot; on the threeR&#39;s, you short-circuit unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
With pure unschooling, dyslexia doesn&#39;t even exist. You&#39;re operating<br/>
in an area I can&#39;t support. You will have problems with dyslexia<br/>
because you&#39;re teaching (no matter how slowly; he&#39;ll know). I did<br/>
NOT have problems with my middle child, lefty, much like his own dad<br/>
and my dad, who DID have school problems. My child had zero problems<br/>
because he figured out on his own how to do things, as all dyslexics<br/>
do in one way or another.<br/>
<br/>
Teaching tricks is good for keeping them not SO far behind the<br/>
assembly line.<br/>
<br/>
In the absence of the need for an assembly line, you&#39;ve created one<br/>
anyway. It&#39;s a start-and-stop assembly line without tests, but<br/>
you&#39;re still &quot;insisting&quot; on some schoolishness, and so unschooling<br/>
won&#39;t thrive.<br/>

===================================<br/>
<br/>
And the response was (seems to me) critical:<br/>
<br/>
===================================<br/>
<br/>
Oh, well.Thanks anyway. no matter how purely we unschool my boys will  <br/>
still have autism. I&#39;m sorry you can only be supportive to  <br/>
homeschoolers that are completely radical in unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
======================================================================== <br/>
==============================================<br/>
My whole website with links to Joyce&#39;s and other people&#39;s websites is  <br/>
insufficient?<br/>
<br/>
Six and a half billion people on the planet.<br/>
300 or 400 million English speakers.<br/>
Thousands of people advocating this or that about reading and dyslexia.<br/>
Why am I responsible for being supportive of any and all  <br/>
homeschoolers, or even of any and all unschoolers?    How much would  <br/>
someone have to pay me for me to &quot;be supportive&quot; of everyone who  <br/>
comes by?<br/>
<br/>
And the autism?  It just popped up then.  It makes it almost like<br/>
&quot;Doctor, will I be able to play the piano?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Wonderful!  I never could before.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The original question is below, and yet I&#39;m supposed to feel guilty  <br/>
(in addition to all else) for boys having autism.  It&#39;s too bad I  <br/>
can&#39;t design and support an unschooling program that will fix  <br/>
everything for everybody, whether I know the details or not.  It&#39;s a  <br/>
sorry thing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
---------------------------------------------------<br/>
I enjoyed your blog/website and thought I&#39;d ask your opinion on  <br/>
unschooling while still meeting the needs of &#39;LDs&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
We have always &#39;quasi-unschooled&#39; I guess. We are not radical  <br/>
unschoolers, but have never gone by grade levels or curriculums or  <br/>
testing. We have always been child interest led and done what works  <br/>
for out boys when it works for them, not what &#39;the experts&#39; say what  <br/>
and when they &#39;need&#39;. But we are not radical ( we do insist on &quot;the 3  <br/>
Rs&quot; but we work them around our kidsi tersts and abilities, etc)<br/>
<br/>
I do like our &#39;almost unschool&#39; ways, but my concern is for my 11 yr  <br/>
old. He has dyslexia, an auditory processing problem and some sensory  <br/>
disorders.  I do not expect him to be on &quot;state grade level&quot; and I  <br/>
know that he&#39;ll get things when he&#39;s ready, but I have some of these  <br/>
issues as well and from my own experience and my research, I believe  <br/>
that he will need to be taught certain things (not just left alone to  <br/>
get when he&#39;s ready), but I still want to go at his pace and his  <br/>
comfort and ability.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I just need some encouragement about how and where therapy  <br/>
and training when it comes to dysfunctions fits into an unschool  <br/>
mindset.<br/>
--------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.  I&#39;m starting to rant a bit.   I&#39;ll go and watch movies and  <br/>
make Thinking Sticks or something now.<br/>
<br/>
If I get shamed a third time in this 24 hour period, I&#39;m going to  <br/>
need a hot fudge sundae or a big cake, because unlike my children, I  <br/>
was trained to use food for reward and comfort, and if I find myself  <br/>
very needy, I WILL eat chocolate, and lots of it.  And it will be too  <br/>
bad someone couldn&#39;t have been more supportive of my offering free  <br/>
ideas and inspiration, even to people who don&#39;t agree with me.    Oh  <br/>
well, mothers of dyslexic made-to-read boys, and mothers who say  <br/>
horsepucky to sweet unschooling teens, and whoever #3 is.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a trap.  The next person who snarks or complains about me is  <br/>
#3, I binge, and someone&#39;s to blame.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1197021920">I think my favorite support of this way of life has come from the little<br/>
(public schooled) boy I nannied & we lived with. Alex is most definitely<br/>
deserving of the labels he comes with, most notedly Aspergers, though they<br/>
really do only matter while he&#39;s in the building and the residual mindset.<br/>
Alex, when he&#39;s *allowed* to be, is pure Alex. Just like every other child,<br/>
with his own unique way of relating to the world. His processing makes sense<br/>
in *his* context, it&#39;s just not always comfortable to navigate his context<br/>
with him, especially with the big time chunks missing in school and it&#39;s<br/>
work. Doesn&#39;t mean relating to Alex wouldn&#39;t be possible & much, much<br/>
easier, in a &quot;radical&quot; unschooling environment. Oh to have him around<br/>
24/7/365 would be a gift to those of us who love him and long to understand<br/>
him easily! School and schoolthink have done this kid no favors.<br/>
He speaks often and fondly of working from home and unschooling his own<br/>
children :)<br/>
<br/>
I remember when Melissa wrote into the Live and Learn list before<br/>
Albuquerque 2006, concerned for our acceptance and understanding of her<br/>
unique children. I couldn&#39;t wait for her to *see* her kids in our<br/>
environment. They&#39;re such bright and shiny kids, they joined right in to<br/>
what appealed to them, they were supported as needed and I think they all<br/>
had a blast. Unschooling is the best thing that ever happened to that<br/>
family. (more than one of several kids are diagnosed on the Autism Spectrum)<br/>
As her kids grow, I see Melissa having a great source of speaking material<br/>
on Unschooling with/through Autism.<br/>

<br/>
It sounds like a guess for some free-form Clue game:<br/>
Sandra Dodd, with chocolate, in the hot tub.<br/>
<br/>
The kids are gone and Keith is out there putting more fire in it  <br/>
*right now.*<br/>
<br/>
I spoke with my dad&#39;s cousin this afternoon for four hours.  That&#39;s  <br/>
right.   Four hours.  She&#39;s in her 60&#39;s.  My dad would be nearly 80,  <br/>
but he died when he was the age I am now, more or less (54, I think  <br/>
he was, I know I am).<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a family reunion this coming weekend.  Holly would like to go  <br/>
if we&#39;d had more time to think about it, so we might plan it for next  <br/>
year, but of the eight siblings on which it was based (my paternal  <br/>
grandmother and her seven siblings), only three of them are still  <br/>
living and one&#39;s in a nursing home.  It might not last enough years  <br/>
longer for us to go.  It&#39;s in Roby, Texas.  Hmmm....   Bunch of  <br/>
Baptist Texans, pretty much.  They love me; I was the oldest  <br/>
grandchild of the second-oldest sibling, the most local and stable  <br/>
one for many years.<br/>
<br/>
I will get points for having a kid named Kirby living in Texas.  (My  <br/>
dad was Kirby, and he lived in Texas when most of them knew him,  <br/>
growing up.)<br/>
<br/>
My ear hurt but the catch-up stories were Great.  Deaths by suicide,  <br/>
bull-riding, automobile accident.  Prison.  Adultery.  Lies and  <br/>
excitement.  Domestic violence.  And that&#39;s the conservative Baptist  <br/>
relatives!<br/>
