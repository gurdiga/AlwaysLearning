<div id="ygrps-yiv-738546126">Hello.  I recall reading just a few days ago about a pattern/shape type workbook that Sandra recommended?  I think it was with regard to picking up interesting curriculum type books from a teacher&#39;s supply store.  I can&#39;t find it anywhere now and I have decided to stop trying to look.  I would rather be playing with my kids.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
 I think I have seen Sandra mention this particular workbook more than once so I was curious what it was.  I am only interested in picking it up to strew and see if my guys are into it.  My oldest (6.5) likes puzzles like the Think Fun games and Suduko. . . <br/>
<br/>
Can someone let me know what the name of it is?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

I think I was just talking about any old workbooks that look good to  <br/>
the kid.  But I&#39;ve talked about geoboards sometimes.  There are  <br/>
workbooks to go with them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sandra also talked recently about pattern *blocks*, after which I went straight on to Amazon and ordered some. <br/>
<br/>
Could it be pattern blocks you&#39;re remembering?<br/>
