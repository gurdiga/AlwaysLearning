<div id="ygrps-yiv-1515200359">We have a &quot;situation&quot; here right now. My son, who is 14 today (wow! when did <br/>
THAT happen??) has a very good (also 14) friend who confided in him a year <br/>
ago that she&#39;s gay. She&#39;s been debating for months on how/when to tell her <br/>
parents, and it came out vaguely in a heated argument a week ago. Two days <br/>
ago, her parents had rummaged through her room and found a love letter from <br/>
her girlfriend. They attacked her with it, and she ran over here in tears <br/>
that night.<br/>
<br/>
Her parents are very religious (SC, remember) and homophobic and know that <br/>
she&#39;s going straight to hell. Her older sister was &quot;Miss Blue Devil&quot;, a <br/>
social butterfly, and modeled for a while; and this girl can&#39;t do anything <br/>
right.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s really a delightful girl---her parents only see &quot;dyke&quot;. They&#39;ve taken <br/>
away her phone, her computer, all functions (no going out with friends, no <br/>
movies, no parties, etc), and (worst of all) called her friend&#39;s parents and <br/>
&quot;outed&quot; this girl as well to her parents! Both girls are very upset---and <br/>
can&#39;t even speak to each other! They don&#39;t go to the same school, so they <br/>
can&#39;t even see each other there.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s welcome to use our phone and computer (although the other girl&#39;s <br/>
parents have agreed that they are NEVER to speak to each other again) and <br/>
just to hang out here as much as possible.&lt; I guess the &quot;straight&quot; boy&#39;s not <br/>
seen as a threat.&gt; And she seems to need to talk both to Cameron and to me.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I was hoping for *something* from y&#39;all---especially maybe <br/>
KathrynB---something that I could give her to help her through this. My <br/>
advice so far has been to &quot;lay low&quot; and not stir things up. And that they can <br/>
control her environment, but not her thoughts, feelings, beliefs, and <br/>
sexuality. And to write a letter telling her parents calmly and gently how <br/>
she feels (all conversations turn into &quot;who can yell the loudest&quot;). <br/>
<br/>
Anything else from y&#39;all?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-397290447">Wow, Kelly!<br/>
<br/>
I feel so much for this girl you described.  I am bisexual and am still not <br/>
out to my parents (who are so Catholic that I am already sentenced to eternal <br/>
flame for marrying a man who was protestant!) at age 30.  I wish I had the <br/>
courage to confront my feelings for both genders when I was younger and still <br/>
living at home.  <br/>
<br/>
I think you are doing the best thing you can...giving her a safe place.  She <br/>
is going through the normal teen stuff of hormones and cliques at her school <br/>
and now to have her parents against her, too, is so hard.  Most teens feel <br/>
that their parents are against them (and, unfortunately, most parents are not <br/>
great at supporting the growth processes of their children), but this <br/>
situation is way more overt than many teens deal with.<br/>
<br/>
As long as you are giving her love, support and information (this is a major <br/>
key issue, too for your son to see and hear) for agencies and stuff.  I would <br/>
encourage helping her find a support group.  The Unitarian Universalist <br/>
Church in Columbia would be a good place to start asking as well as a local <br/>
university.  I would also feel comfortable talking with her via email if she <br/>
wished.  <br/>
<br/>
Hang in there and keep reminding her of her choices.  Some times it is hard <br/>
to see all the paths that are open when we are in the midst of anguish  ( I <br/>
got that from Ren!).  I will keep you in my thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
Blessed Be,<br/>

Then she can have her computer back.<br/>
<br/>
What a horror show for her, poor thing.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And to write a letter telling her parents calmly and gently how <br/>
she feels (all conversations turn into &quot;who can yell the loudest&quot;). &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, but not until she moves out and has her own place.  No sense on earth <br/>
trying to change the point of view of dogged fundamentalists, not if you&#39;re <br/>
the daughter whose very disobedience is a huge personal shame for them <br/>
personally.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d talk Cameron into an acting job for a few months or years.  If they can <br/>
do it kinda campy and tongue in cheek they might not feel like liars, but <br/>
like they&#39;re players putting on a show for people whose social awareness <br/>
could use some adjustment.<br/>
<br/>
And when the girl&#39;s finally independent and writing her letter, she could say <br/>
&quot;Cameron and I put on an act for you because it would make you feel better, <br/>
and you NEEDED to feel better.  He was never really my boyfriend.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But then, on the other hand, consider that one girl/girl affair doesn&#39;t mean <br/>
she isn&#39;t going to end up heterosexual or bisexual, and be the married mother <br/>
of half a dozen cool kids.  So because that IS a potential maybe Cameron <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to go too far in the act unless he really likes her, too.<br/>
<br/>
Too many people see sexuality as a plain two-way switch, either you&#39;re <br/>
&#39;queer&#39; and that&#39;s that, or you&#39;re &#39;straight&#39; and that&#39;s that, but people are <br/>
not that extreme in most cases.  <br/>
<br/>
We played an ongoing game once for a few weeks when there were was NO reason <br/>
not to have sex, no risk of disease, pregnancy or emotional betrayal would <br/>
matter because we were all about to be obliterated...  who would we want to <br/>
mess with?   The guys were disgusted that three or more of the women named <br/>
this one certain dangerous white-trash Missouri drug dealer of all our <br/>
acquaintance.  Scuzzy, had been beaten by his dad with a 2x4 and his jaw was <br/>
all crooked, he was a liar and at the age of 32 had never yet had a real job. <br/>
 And we said GLEN!   But almost every person, male AND female, named one <br/>
hetero lady we know.  Nobody was going to actually act on this stuff, and she <br/>
was in a long term relationship that is now past 25 years.  Nobody was much <br/>
surprised that she was top of all lists.  And she said &quot;Glen!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So attraction isn&#39;t easy, and being in love once doesn&#39;t make a life pattern. <br/>
 Every gay friend I&#39;m thinking of was either once married (and I went to some <br/>
of those weddings), or they had a true heterosexual love in high school (one <br/>
in particular, I still know both people, and was then at the lesbian wedding <br/>
that followed years later).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d help her calm down and be happy about flowers, ice cream, other things <br/>
entirely, and let her know it is NOT something that has defined the rest of <br/>
her life, neither the letter nor her parents&#39; reaction, but that every moment <br/>
is new and she can come to clarity slowly--it doesn&#39;t have to be today.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My nephew did something like this.  He is gay and knew at about 14.  He<br/>
didn&#39;t come out to his parents until he was living on his own.   <br/>
In high school he met a girl, also gay, and they sort of teamed up.  They<br/>
went to school functions together, dances, etc. and genuinely liked each<br/>
other.  They got a few lectures from their parents about &quot;getting too<br/>
serious&quot;, but it was better than what they would have had to deal with if<br/>
they&#39;d come out.  Their senior year book had a picture of them together<br/>
with a &quot;next stop, wedding chapel&quot;  caption, which they both thought was<br/>
very funny.<br/>
<br/>
They are still good friends now at 27,  both happy in openly gay<br/>
relationships,  both, sadly, still dealing with angry parents.  But the<br/>
little deception was a way for them to survive, support each other and<br/>
have a kind of social life they wouldn&#39;t have had if they&#39;d come out<br/>
sooner.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-298690044">Having known many gay, bisexual, hetero and shades in<br/>
between teens when I was a teen myself in San<br/>
Francisco, I advise this girl to be very careful with<br/>
her parents.  She is under their thumb at this age and<br/>
they can do many things to her that they should not be<br/>
able to, legally and otherwise.  I have seen firsthand<br/>
the terrible nastiness that can result when parents<br/>
&quot;lose it&quot; over their kid&#39;s coming out.  <br/>
<br/>
A lot of the kids I knew in San Francisco were from<br/>
shelters and halfway houses.  There are a LOT of them<br/>
there, as California is a destination for homeless<br/>
people seeking milder climate, and San Francisco a<br/>
haven for gay culture that these abused and disowned<br/>
young people flock to like moths to a flame.  Taking<br/>
away what they consider &quot;privledges&quot; and screaming at<br/>
her are not even close to the worst they could do.  I<br/>
think the idea of an ally of the opposite sex who can<br/>
help calm the parents with a &quot;hetero deception&quot; while<br/>
she is still in their house is an excellent idea, and<br/>
a preserving one for this girl, for her mind, spirit<br/>
AND body.  <br/>
