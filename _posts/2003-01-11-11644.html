<div id="ygrps-yiv-1857694178">From the PCS Edventures website:<br/>
&quot;&quot;Welcome to Edventures.COM!<br/>
The educational adventure where kids discover how things work. Build smarter <br/>
kids with brighter futures! Edventures uses exciting hands-on projects, safe <br/>
and secure communication tools, and a powerful reward system to motivate kids <br/>
for 21st Century success&quot;&quot;  <br/>
It seems to be some sort of science/math curriculum. I read through most of <br/>
the website and still can&#39;t be any more specific about what it is. (other <br/>
than expensive)<br/>
Now to see what the Jason Project is... <br/>
<br/>
&quot;The JASON Projectâ„¢         <br/>
    The JASON Project is a multi-disciplinary program that sparks the <br/>
imagination of students and enhances the classroom experience. From oceans to <br/>
rain forests, from polar regions to volcanoes, the JASON Project explores <br/>
Planet Earth and exposes students to leading scientists who work with them to <br/>
examine its biological and geological development.  &quot;&quot;<br/>
    <br/>
In our area (Wash, DC) National Geographic Society has a group that welcomes <br/>
homeschoolers. I believe there are a few here that take advantage of it. <br/>
No-one I know personally.   It&#39;s a little more organized than I would like, <br/>
but if my kids asked about it I would take them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Whooo, and doesn&#39;t that give a body the shivers...  I can build a smarter <br/>
kid with a brighter future!  I wonder if they use plastics in these <br/>
brighter, smarter kids and if I can visit the factory to watch?<br/>
<br/>
...and I wonder what their &#39;powerful reward system&#39; is, that it will <br/>
&#39;motivate kids for 21st century success&quot;?  Large snarling dogs dripping <br/>
pavement-burning saliva?  Thousands of dollars for every minute the kid <br/>
spends logged on?  A guaranteed job that pays in the six figures for doing <br/>
no work at all?  Hey, I WANT ONE OF THOSE!!!!  I&#39;m gonna go log on!<br/>
<br/>
And what exactly IS &#39;21st century success&#39; anyway, and whose in-laws get to <br/>
define it?<br/>
<br/>
...musing out loud...<br/>
