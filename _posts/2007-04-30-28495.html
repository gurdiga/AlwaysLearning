<div id="ygrps-yiv-2115258704">One last reminder that the Early Bird Deadline for conference <br/>
registration ends today!<br/>
<br/>
You also *must* receive a coupon for a funshop prior to registering, as <br/>
were are not set up to provide coupons after-the-fact.<br/>
<br/>
So get your funshop requests in *before* you register!<br/>
<br/>
You do not have to register *and* pay for meals *and* pay for lodging <br/>
all today. As long as it&#39;s all covered by July 31, that&#39;s fine. But to <br/>
save with the Early Bird registration, you only have a few more hours!<br/>
<br/>
As of 9:00 this morning, we already have 111 families registered! MANY <br/>
of them (more than half!) are new! It will be very exciting with all <br/>
these new faces!<br/>
