<div id="ygrps-yiv-1309574018">Thanks for all your input.  We did just join a Unitarian <br/>
Universalist &quot;church&quot; a couple of weeks ago and today she had her <br/>
first &quot;Sunday School&quot; where they will be learning about all the <br/>
religions of the world.  She enjoyed it and I&#39;m hoping that this <br/>
classroom environment will be all she needs.<br/>
<br/>
Lauren is very different from me.  I&#39;m a very unstructured soul, <br/>
perhaps because my childhood took place in an overly structured <br/>
environment.  When we&#39;re in a hurry, I have to stop Lauren from <br/>
cleaning her room and making her bed.  Her shoes are all perfectly <br/>
positioned in her closet and there is NEVER a mess on the floor.  She <br/>
even begs me for a bed time.  I tell her she can go to bed whenever <br/>
she wants, but she won&#39;t go without her sister who does not want a <br/>
bed time.  Sounds like she&#39;s dying for some kind of structure which <br/>
is very difficult for me.<br/>
<br/>
So the next question is:  When a child seems to want structure but <br/>
then rejects it, what do you do?  She&#39;s asking for homeschooling <br/>
lessons from her reading workbook (her idea, not mine), but then when <br/>
I suggest doing it for a half hour in the mornings, she&#39;s never in <br/>
the mood.  I work at night and their father doesn&#39;t really <br/>
participate.  Any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>

Help her make schedules and set alarms if she wants, but don&#39;t  <br/>
enforce it on her.  That&#39;s what I would do.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe let her set the time in advance, instead of asking her, and  <br/>
then if she says she&#39;s not in the mood, let it go.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1696615144">I&#39;d say help her make up her own schedule. Don&#39;t agree to enforce it,  <br/>
although she might ask you to remind her and that seems okay to me.  <br/>
I&#39;d even agree to sort of play teacher a little, if she wanted that,  <br/>
but I would be very very very easygoing about it - take her lead  <br/>
entirely. So, if she says, &quot;I want you to give me spelling lessons,&quot;  <br/>
you can say, &quot;Okay, what words do you want to spell?&quot; And then ask  <br/>
her, &quot;How do you want the lessons to be done?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t any different from how I played with my girls, anyway.  <br/>
When we played &quot;dollhouse,&quot; they would usually tell me, &quot;Okay, mom,  <br/>
you have this one and take her there and dress her in this and make  <br/>
her say that.....&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
And, when you get a chance, talk about natural learning a little.  <br/>
Help her understand real learning as different than being taught.<br/>

<br/>
It isn&#39;t uncommon for little girls, especially, to sort of want to  <br/>
play school. They want to figure out what they are missing and they  <br/>
live in a culture that really acts, on the surface, like it values  <br/>
school so much, it makes sense that they&#39;d want to act it out. That  <br/>
IS how kids process things, very often.<br/>
