<div id="ygrps-yiv-2130496346">Last month I had a stressful evening when my husband brought home a 1st <br/>
grade curriculum book for my oldest dd(7). He said he would work on it <br/>
with her. I said she wouldn&#39;t like it if he made her and what would he <br/>
tell the other dd&#39;s? They would want to be with him, too. He let it <br/>
drop. But it made me mad. I know all he sees is them watching tv and <br/>
movies all the time. I see this: they can remember actors and what <br/>
movies they have been in or done voice-overs for, especially Tom Hanks. <br/>
There&#39;s this one obscure character in The Fifth Element that I couldn&#39;t <br/>
remember what else he&#39;d been in, but Aislinn knew he was from Something <br/>
About Mary. It might not be stuff out of a curriculum book, but I&#39;m <br/>
impressed. Two weeks ago Aislinn made up a game. It&#39;s sort of an I-spy <br/>
with words. Each person must find a written word in the room and spell <br/>
it, then the others must find the word. Even Soleille (3) was playing <br/>
but with her own special rules. Right now Aislinn is playing a Reader <br/>
Rabbit game with Soleille on her lap, teaching her letters and numbers <br/>
while Elysia (5) has Leiren (15m) on the dining room table teaching her <br/>
how to scribble with crayons. People who think these children can&#39;t <br/>
learn without it being forced have never really watched them...never let <br/>
them alone to do what they want.<br/>
<br/>
My dh is worried about Aislinn not knowing how to read. Aislinn is <br/>
worried about it, too, because she sees Hooked-On-Phonics commercials <br/>
that show parents so upset about their kids not reading. I told her to <br/>
relax. That she&#39;s learning to read every day, a little at a time. I told <br/>
her breaking a code can be like that. It can be a struggle or it can be <br/>
easy if you just keep yourself open to it and let it flow. She&#39;s still <br/>
worrying over it. But then again, she&#39;s a worrier.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, she&#39;s built herself a house on top of our refrigerator. <br/>
Elysia&#39;s is on top of the piano. Soleille goes between the two as a <br/>
houseguest. You&#39;re all welcome, too, if your not afraid of heights!<br/>
<br/>
All in all, things are going great. Dh and others will see it <br/>
eventually. How could they not. Have a great day, everyone. Heidi Case</div>
