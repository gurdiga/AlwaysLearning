<div id="ygrps-yiv-66950515">Iâm learning about unschooling, using what I read here and also using what Iâve been reading in books by Naomi Aldort, (Raising our Kidsâ¦), and Alfie Kohn, (Unconditional Parenting) and feel that Iâm moving in the right direction.<br/>
<br/>
And now I feel guilty. Something must be wrong when I am so happy to be with my children all day? I have never, or rarely, felt this way before, I have always been overwhelmed with all the tasks I have at home and with raising children. I must be lazy, Iâm not âdoingâ much (besides spending time with them, sewing and reading next to them, cooking, etc - and thatâs what makes me happy), the twins (8) are often in front of a screen, and the last two days my 10 year old schooled son has been home sick and Iâm so happy to have him home coughing on the sofa.<br/>
<br/>
My husband works a lot, 12+ hour days and more work from home in the evening, and Iâm having *fun* at home with the kids, *enjoying* them? I keep comparing his work day to mine, and I feel so guilty. Heâs the one who makes our lives possible providing a good income. Heâs working so hard for us! When weâre watching tv or utube, or playing videogames, Iâm thinking about all the things we âshouldâ do. When the boys donât get out of their pjs all day, I feel guilty I didnât take them outside for fresh air (itâs raining!). <br/>
<br/>
I feel that heâs watching us becoming more relaxed about a lot of things (not getting that haircut because they donât want to, not getting dressed, playing videogames âallâ day) and heâs not liking it. He sees what weâre NOT doing, and I see it too. <br/>
<br/>
I feel more and more in love with the boys the more I am with them in their activities, and Iâm getting the love back in hugs and words. Heâs not liking them so well now. He thinks their behavior is worse. I see them as freer, and a little on the wild side because they have less restrictions now. They are often acting silly and canât stop. It can be annoying and sometimes leads to fights with big brother. He compares them to big brother whoâs been reading Big Books since he was 7 and is a Good Student. They donât listen very well; they donât want to clean up. I help them. I need to make sure the house is reasonably clean and orderly when my husband comes home so thereâs less for him to be annoyed at when heâs tired. I try to help everyone in the family so that we can move forward with unschooling. So Iâm feeling stressed and guilty.<br/>
<br/>
I guess itâs part of our deschooling process to get rid of the guilt and the âshouldsâ?<br/>
Or is guilt always a part of life? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-928631242">You won&#39;t feel guilty if you show your appreciation to your husband for <br/>
providing you with such a wonderful lifestyle. Isn&#39;t that WHY he works <br/>
so hard?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you&#39;re making too many changes too quickly. Back off and just say <br/>
yes more, but don&#39;t unilaterally change the way you (two) are raising <br/>
your children. If you want to keep your marriage a good one, or even <br/>
make it a better one, then don&#39;t dismiss or disregard your husband&#39;s <br/>
concerns.<br/>
<br/>
I found that it was a big mistake to try to minimize my husband&#39;s <br/>
concerns. When he thought the kids were too...whatever --- lazy, wild, <br/>
unfocused, not learning what they should be, ....whatever.... it helped <br/>
him a lot if I would acknowledge why it seemed that way to him.<br/>
<br/>
For example, he says: &quot;Johnny is way too wild. So-and-so big brother <br/>
wasn&#39;t like that at his age. He shouldn&#39;t be allowed to act like that.&quot; <br/>
You can say, &quot;He&#39;s not that wild. He&#39;s just being a normal kid. I&#39;m so <br/>
happy to see him have the freedom to be himself.&quot; blah blah blah  Your <br/>
husband is NOT going to feel like you were listening - he&#39;s going to <br/>
feel like you&#39;re off on a path of your own and not on one with him.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, just maybe say, &quot;I know - he&#39;s a lot more active than so-and-so <br/>
was.&quot; Acknowledge the reality, at least, of what your husband is <br/>
noticing. Sometimes, that creates a minor miracle. Your husband might <br/>
shock you by saying, &quot;Well, each kid is different,&quot; and just moving on. <br/>
Or, he might want to talk about how to control him and you might be able <br/>
to have a conversation about helping the kid be wild in ways that don&#39;t <br/>
impinge as much on other people&#39;s comfort. A dad who is working as hard <br/>
as your husband is kind of deserves to come home to a relatively <br/>
peaceful home. Acknowledge THAT, too, and look for solutions that take <br/>
that into account.<br/>
<br/>
Just ideas - maybe they&#39;ll inspire you to look a little deeper for your <br/>
own answers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-244201353">I thinks it&#39;s normal for you to feel that way.  I know that guilt was one reason it took me a while to completely unschool my kids.  It just seemed too good to be true.  I was so used to the &quot;no pain, no gain&quot; mentality all of my life that it seemed strange at first to let go of that. So I suggest you also take your time.  I also think that you should give your hubby time to &quot;deschool&quot;.  <br/>
I must say that for me unschooling doesn&#39;t mean letting my kids go &quot;wild&quot;.  At leat not at the expence of the peace of others in our home.  I think it&#39;s great that you&#39;r relationship with your kids is improving, but if their relationships with their dad and older brother are being harmed then something is not right.<br/>
I have 4 kids 9yrs-1yr old and our in-laws live with us.  Also my bro-in-law is staying with us temporarily.  I let my kids know that we should treat others the way we would like to be treated and that is with love and respect.<br/>
Freedom is wonderful, but freedom doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s ok to do whatever we feel like doing at the expence of other people.  That is even true in our society.<br/>
<br/>
