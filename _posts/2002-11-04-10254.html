&gt;&gt; He could play the bad guy if they<br/>
&gt;&gt; ever make a movie out of Outlander<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; YES!!<br/>
&gt; But who would play Jaime?<br/>
&gt; and claire?<br/>
&gt; Hugh Grant could play the Vicker&#39;s foster son (from the later books)<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t think it could be as good as the books.<br/>
&gt; When is the next one coming out?<br/>
&gt; Elissa<br/>
&gt; ps I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll really die in 1776. I think it&#39;s another fake like<br/>
&gt; Jaime&#39;s grave stone at Culloden. I think they stage it and run off together<br/>
&gt; to live in the woods.<br/>
&gt; I hope I hope I hope<br/>

 </span></blockquote>He played Elliot Marston, the owner of Marston Waters Ranch. Who hires <br/>
Quigley to wipe out the local Aboriginal population. Not a great film! There <br/>
are so many inconsistencies... it is set in the Australian Outback, but wait, <br/>
I don&#39;t think that is the real Outback, more like someone&#39;s, who has never <br/>
heard of the Outback, or even seen a picture of Australia, idea of the <br/>
Outback. But good if you like to see Alan! <br/>
<br/>
As for the attraction? Its his lips, his eyes, his hair, his voice... He has <br/>
great timing as an actor. (and he has a great body!) He comes across as very <br/>
dominant, powerful, rich! He is such a great actor, that other actors, who <br/>
shall remain nameless, have cut many of his scenes out of their movies. I&#39;m <br/>
sure because the nameless actor was so insecure of his own acting abilities <br/>
that he realized that Rickman overshadowed him. I am sure what the nameless <br/>
actor really wanted to do was cut Rickman totally out of his movie, but then <br/>
you can&#39;t have a good guy running through the forest without a villainous <br/>
sheriff now can you? <br/>
<br/>
I have heard that he is or was participating in a project to film all 19 <br/>
plays by Samuel Beckett. Released on television in Ireland and then the UK <br/>
and then sometime, maybe, in America in theaters. I did not like the movie <br/>
*The Search for John Gissing* But Alan was very funny in it. IMHO, the <br/>
director should have used Janeane Garofalo and Alan Rickman more, it would <br/>
have made a much better dark comedy. But what do you do when the lead actor <br/>
is also the director?<br/>
<br/>
Just a few of my thoughts. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

(She was a senior, I was a freshman.)<br/>
<br/>
Do you ever get calls from video/DVD clubs?  One outfit calls here about<br/>
once a month.  Their advertising plan is to sell you on movies by the<br/>
hottest stars, so they&#39;ll ask you if you like so-and-so; last time, they<br/>
stared with Jennifer Lopez.  I cut &#39;em off fast, told the guy I didn&#39;t like<br/>
anybody he was likely to name (I can&#39;t *remember* them right now!), and hung<br/>
up.  One time, I wasn&#39;t busy otherwise, so I kept the woman going for 20<br/>
minutes as she tried to find a movie to interest me.  I finally asked if<br/>
&quot;You Can Count on Me&quot; was on her list, since that was the only film I liked<br/>
which my dh hadn&#39;t already bought &lt;g&gt;.  They didn&#39;t.<br/>

I still think Jean-Luc Picard is the hottest thing in space.<br/>
