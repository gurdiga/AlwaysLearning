<div id="ygrps-yiv-653273519">Thought I would share this with you all.  My son is going on 8 <br/>
months.  About three weeks ago he started to run a high temp. 103.5 <br/>
after Tylenol and Motrin. I would usually take him to our <br/>
pediatrician about 25 miles from where we live, but we were snowed <br/>
in.  I made an appointment with a Dr I knew at our local McFarland <br/>
clinic.  The Dr. diagnosed him with the flu and told me to wait it <br/>
out.  I took Brandon back to the Dr.s a second time (still snowed in) <br/>
because he was getting congested.  Same diagnoses and promises of a <br/>
recovery real soon plus a prescription for an antihistamine with <br/>
codeine.  I was concerned about giving my son the codeine.  He <br/>
guaranteed me that it was fine.  I took him back a third time (all in <br/>
a week or so time) because I wanted to make sure that Brandon wasn&#39;t <br/>
getting pneumonia.  He told me everything looked great and that I <br/>
should be giving him the codeine to help him sleep at night.  I had <br/>
only been giving it to him when he seemed really distressed and we <br/>
had been up for a while trying to get him to sleep.  Anyways.  Then a <br/>
few days later (cough mostly gone, fever lower.)  Brandon develops <br/>
pink eye.  Mind you I never once took my son our daughter out of the <br/>
house during that week. I think Brandon got pink eye from poor hand <br/>
washing on the Dr.s part.  Soooo, by this time the roads are clear, <br/>
my daughter is complaining of and earache and I make an appointment <br/>
for her to be seen by our Pediatrician and ask the Dr. to look at <br/>
Brandon&#39;s eyes. Chelsea has two ear infections.  He looked at Brandon <br/>
eyes. Pink eye.  He looked in his left ear.. severe ear infection, <br/>
in his right her ear infection.  The pediatrician thinks that my <br/>
son never had the flu, but had an upper respiratory infection that <br/>
lead to ear infections that was missed three times by our local <br/>
Dr.!!!!  So, this whole time I have been sedating my son because I <br/>
thought he was uncomfortable from the flu when what his real problem <br/>
was an ear infection!  Very Very disturbing.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ladies,  listen to your instincts!  I didn&#39;t feel right about the <br/>
codeine or the local Dr. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-785874307">I always feel so hesitant to go to the doctor&#39;s office for me or the <br/>
girls. It always seems like everything is just a guess and I feel like I <br/>
could probably get just as much information off the internet or from <br/>
some of my own medical books. I had tendonitis in my foot last spring <br/>
and the nurse practitioner told me that because I was nursing I should <br/>
take frequent, high doses of Tylenol because at that amount it would <br/>
have an anti-inflamitory effect. She said I shouldn&#39;t take Advil, which <br/>
IS an anti-inflamitory, because of my nursing. That&#39;s just ridiculous. <br/>
If one Tylenol doesn&#39;t have the ability to bring down swelling due to <br/>
the very nature of its ingredients, a whole bottleful isn&#39;t going to cut <br/>
it either. Besides, if Advil is so bad for babies, why do they make <br/>
Infant&#39;s Advil???<br/>
<br/>
Question: What do you call the person who placed last on their medical <br/>
exams?<br/>
<br/>
Answer: Doctor.<br/>
