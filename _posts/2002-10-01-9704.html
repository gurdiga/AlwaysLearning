<br/>
When our first children were 4 years old and all their playmates went off to<br/>
schools, preschools, and Waldorf Kindergarden, 4 of us moms who had decided to<br/>
homeschool arranged a co-op. Basically each week a family hosted and another<br/>
mom would stay. That left 2 moms to go to coffee, shop, take care of bills, or<br/>
hang out. We all had second kids so we had 4 4-5 year olds and 4  2 year olds.<br/>
We sang a song or more, did a craft, played and then had lunch for the kids<br/>
and moms. Seeing the kids sit down and eat and socialize was beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
 These moms and kids are still our favored friends. Even though 2 families<br/>
have moved out of town. This summer 3 of us all got together for a week of<br/>
condo camping and fishing. We had 9 kids between us and the kids truely have<br/>
deep lasting friendship with each other. I think the co-op lasted for 1 1/2<br/>
years and stopped when 1 kid then went to kindergarden and the rest of us got<br/>
more involved in our local homeschool support group. It was very easy to host<br/>
too. Cobstruction paper, glue, paint, playdough, cookies. I think we all used<br/>
Alternatives to Preschool for ideas, which is an LLL book.<br/>
