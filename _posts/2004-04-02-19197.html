I am looking for suggestions of online games that are appropriate and fun<br/>
for a non-reading 4 year-old.  She is tired of the &quot;learning&quot; games  (i.e.<br/>
&quot;how-to-read,&quot; dot-to-dot, matching).  She is interested in the solar<br/>
system, dinosaurs, fairies, pirates and the weather in particular.  Any<br/>
suggestions are welcome!<br/>
BBC has a website with dinosaur games your daughter might enjoy.  It is from <br/>
their show Walking with Dinosaurs.  My son Sam (4) really liked it!  - Sandy<br/>
