<div id="ygrps-yiv-58693070">I don&#39;t know whether it was on this list or maybe another one or just  <br/>
on the Lyrics Game, but several of us were frustrated about not being  <br/>
able to find lyrics or a source for a song. This was just posted on  <br/>

RE:<br/>
I wish I was magic, I&#39;s magically find, a secret passage traveling  <br/>
through space and time/to far away places, that i&#39;ve only seen, in  <br/>
story books and picture shows and in my dreams. I wish there were  <br/>
forests.. blah blah blah Cause wishes are magic and wishes have wings  <br/>
a sky full of wishes and the whole world sings...blah blah<br/>
<br/>
The Song that Wind Whispers and Anonymous were looking for is called  <br/>
I wish I was magic, by Linda Arnold. The Album is Peppermint Wings...  <br/>
if you want an example of the song- I found it at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/">http://tinyurl.com/</a> <br/>
5aqkl2 I spent 5 months hard searching for it- so I hope y&#39;all see  <br/>
this posting. Cheers~ ibaphilosophizor<br/>
