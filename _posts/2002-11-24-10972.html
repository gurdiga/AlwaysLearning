<div id="ygrps-yiv-617152033">Yeah, we have those too.  My daughter has until the last month been determined to be a boy,  And demanded a short boy haircut.  And my son, who&#39;s two, won&#39;t allow anyone near him with clippers so he has long hair with beautiful baby curls in back.  People think he&#39;s a girl all the time (even though he looks all boy to me).  But no one except family has ever made a rude comment that he needs a haircut.  I guess they all figure that I&#39;m some radical hippie and their attempts at changing my mind would be useless.  Never mind that he often carries a purse.  :)<br/>
Oh yeah and for the adorable kid contest LOL.  My dd Kathrynn has the most beautiful eyes!  Everyone says so.  They&#39;re asian in shape almond shaped.  They were blue until she was almost two.  We thought for sure they weren&#39;t going to change.  When they finally did they became a sort of green brown color that changes in different light.  We call them penny eyes because they look exactly like copper pennies.  And she has pale skin.  Much paler than mine.  And her hair is a beautiful chestnut brown.  She looks nothing like we thought she would.  We expected a lot more of the asian genes to shine through.  Her hair is full but soft and a little wavy.  Brown (to daddy&#39;s jet black) with red-ish highlights.  For quite some time Shawn insisted there was no way that was his kid :).  She is!  I promise!<br/>
Then along came Aiden.  He got daddy&#39;s dark complexion and dark dark brown eyes.  But his features are less asian and his hair is even lighter than his sisters.  Its sort of Ash brown/blond like miney.  We joke that in the summer he&#39;s all one color.  :)  His hair is soft and flyaway with baby curls (I think they will all go away when he gets them cut :( )He got daddy&#39;s height and build though.   <br/>
I KNOW that Shawn is their father but am really begining to wonder who Shawn&#39;s father was LOL :)  They just don&#39;t seem fully half asian!!  My friend&#39;s son who is 1/4 Japanese and 3/4 white looks WAY more asian than my kids.  But oh well.  They are the cutest kids I&#39;ve ever seen!!!  :D   <br/>

 </span></blockquote>OK, I&#39;d like to chime in here, too....my kids are both tall and good-lookin&#39; <br/>
kids, though my ds&#39;s ears stick out a tiny bit like my hubby&#39;s. My daughter <br/>
who is 3 looks much like my mother&#39;s baby pictures and is really, really a <br/>
beautiful child (yes, I&#39;m also a little biased!) . Strangers stop me and ask <br/>
if she&#39;s on TV and say that she should be a child model. (I can hardly <br/>
imagine my strong-willed active daughter holding a pose for longer than 2 <br/>
seconds! LOL) However, I do have a little concern about  what my son thinks <br/>
when strangers gush over his sister while he just stands there. Usually, they <br/>
are polite enough to throw in something about, &quot;Oh, look, and here&#39;s the big <br/>
brother!&quot; <br/>
