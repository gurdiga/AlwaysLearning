<br/>
It seems fine with me.<br/>
Yesterday I was asked whether I liked or didn&#39;t like &quot;radical  <br/>
unschooling&quot; as a term.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s an interesting question.   I forget that my webpage says &quot;Radical  <br/>
Unschooling&quot; right across the top.  I would have called it  <br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot; but someone who was already at expage.com had already  <br/>
used that name, so I used radical.<br/>
<br/>
Then I never changed that page.<br/>
<br/>
But I don&#39;t use &quot;radical unschooling&quot; outside of discussions about  <br/>
unschooling.  And with strangers, I just say my kids don&#39;t go to  <br/>
school, or didn&#39;t go to school, or we homeschooled.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not at all comfortable with the &quot;RU&quot; useage--not even in writing,  <br/>
but worse, some people are using it as a word, and as a verb &quot;we ru&#39;d,  <br/>
or &quot;ruing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think Unschooling with a capital U is a good alternative.<br/>
<br/>
And I know it&#39;s not a great word, but for people new to the list and  <br/>
the ideas, here&#39;s a what and why about  the &quot;un&quot; in &quot;unschool&quot;:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1041536606">It&#39;s difficult for me at times to change so many of my ideas about how <br/>
people relate.  I&#39;m learning a different set of cultural cues and <br/>
responses.<br/>
<br/>
That makes total sense to me to say that unschooling is like learning a <br/>
language.  The awkwardness, the fear of making mistakes, the insecurity <br/>
of whether or not we&#39;re expressing ourselves clearly.  Oh actually it <br/>
sounds like the difficulty so many of us have with intimacy.  :D<br/>
<br/>
The thought that unschooling is like learning a new language also <br/>
presents a less polarized comparison of school and unschooling, where <br/>
unschooling is not really the opposite of school or schooling nor is <br/>
each set up in a dichotomy against the other, in a dual.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re translating our familiar points of view into new perspectives.  <br/>
We&#39;re learning to live our lives in simplicity, right next to our core <br/>
values, rather than lacking the words in our old &quot;language&quot; of school <br/>
to, as much as possible, be true to ourselves.<br/>

how much I love Geoffrey Holder&#39;s voice, and his laugh.<br/>
<br/>
I used to get mixed up about the term &quot;deschooling,&quot;<br/>
even though you explain it in great detail and provide<br/>
links to others&#39; definitions of it too!  My own experience<br/>
in school was so negative that I used to think of deschooling<br/>
as analogous to detoxing, as if that what we are moving away <br/>
from (school) is something that is inherently not good (like a<br/>
toxin).<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s not it at all.  The deschooling link helps me<br/>
to get what deschooling *is*, and so does the balance<br/>
link.  And I like, but can&#39;t find, the one that talks about<br/>
choosing to go to school, on one&#39;s own terms.<br/>

garbage to the end of the link like a;spoiwer.aksdn<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-421274549">It is amazing that the epiphanies seem to come so frequently in this life. The other day I was baking a cake and David got back from the grocery store and had to deal with the leaking coolant on the car and needed help putting the groceries away. I was up to my elbows in batter and asked Simon and Linnaea if they could help. They both came in and put all the groceries away and went back to what they were doing. It was so sweet, so not coercive, so not eye-rolling. Just this generous gift of service. It came with an epiphany, an underscoring of these unschooling side effects that I see and read about from other people.<br/>
<br/>
As you say, the proof is in the living! The rightness, the evidence, the closeness, the joy, those are all found in this life. You can read about them, but to experience them you have to get down on your hands and knees and play and hang out and tell stories and cuddle and talk and share and be willing to listen and to apologize and to work to make it better. And if you can do that without any other intention that enjoying being with them, without any alterior motives, it plays out in ways that nothing else that I&#39;ve ever seen does. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is it the word &quot;epiphany?&quot;  In religion that word speaks to beliefs, <br/>
miracles and magical transformation.  In the absence of religion it <br/>
more closely speaks to thought, discovery and change.  Both can contain <br/>
overtones of gratitude which often translate as awe, reverence and <br/>
worshipfulness (or love).  I laughed when I put in the word <br/>
&quot;worshipfulness&quot; there because I heard behind it a little chorus of <br/>
&quot;we&#39;re not worthy&quot; from Wayne&#39;s World, which we watched last night.<br/>
<br/>
In both cases it&#39;s possible to look at unschooling (and anything else) <br/>
with the intent of &quot;worship&quot; or gratitude, and not be able to see it or <br/>
believe it wherever one isn&#39;t living it.  And what happens is a wish to <br/>
live somewhere we don&#39;t... almost like nostalgia, except for never <br/>
having been there or experienced it.  Armchair unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s an easy trap to hear about unschooling and to be fully <br/>
onboard intellectually ... yet never really live it.  Honestly my <br/>
thoughts about unschooling never waver, but I could easily never do any <br/>
of what I think about it.  Just continue to agree with it, argue for <br/>
it, and leave it at that for far far too long.<br/>
<br/>
I personally feel that&#39;s THE biggest piece of deschooling I do on a <br/>
daily basis: to take the emphasis off only reading, reporting, speaking <br/>
about it --all that stuff that&#39;s highly rated in school-- and put my <br/>
attention, my senses and my hands toward experiencing, knowing and <br/>
learning it.<br/>
<br/>
In the interest of not missing the chance to more fully BE with our <br/>
children, I thought I would put in another plug for this link:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/being/">http://sandradodd.com/being/</a>  That&#39;s my big page to go to these days.  <br/>
It&#39;s on my fridge along with a great thing from Pam on &quot;What do <br/>
Unschoolers DO?&quot; which was inspired by a question posed by none other <br/>
than Jenny Cyphers.  :D<br/>

to pick out favorite bits from such <br/>
a great post by but I think for me it might have to be &#39;other people will<br/>
have to come to their own epiphanies.  <br/>
Really spoke to me when I read that.  Maybe here&#39;s why...<br/>
 <br/>
Yesterday, ds 14 now, was feeling very strongly about people &#39;not being able<br/>
to see outside the box&#39;.  I told him I <br/>
used to feel a lot like that too about some things with people and would get<br/>
so frustrated sometimes.  I explained <br/>
how I went from getting so frustrated to sadness for those people, thanks to<br/>
his dad, and now I&#39;m more in the <br/>
acceptance part.  Having a close relative that struggles so unbelievably<br/>
hard, it feels to me, with any new thought or<br/>
idea has probably been a large part of my journey to this point.  <br/>
 <br/>
I think maybe I&#39;m a visual person because I explained it similar to this...<br/>
We pictured a certain person we know<br/>
all tightly but very comfortably and happily boxed up.  They are totally in<br/>
their comfortable zone and for some reason,<br/>
maybe past negative experiences they get very *scared* when that box starts<br/>
to move or expand even a little bit.  <br/>
Some of us have learned what a good thing this can be and even look forward<br/>
to it happening again but not them.  <br/>
They just can&#39;t come to understand how much happier and better things are<br/>
outside of such a tight confining<br/>
place they now live in.   <br/>
 <br/>
I just thought this from reading this morning...  maybe some people need to<br/>
be dumped out of the box to get it,<br/>
some can only handle the tiniest little seeds of thought at a time and some<br/>
no matter what are never going to <br/>
accept that the sunshine and happiness is so much more incredible outside of<br/>
their little boxes.  <br/>

-=-The proof is in the living! I will keeping on living the life that <br/>
I&#39;m<br/>
living, because I KNOW it works, I SEE it. I don&#39;t doubt it at all!<br/>
Other people will have to come to their own epiphany. I really like<br/>
that word for KNOWing unschooling. I have little epiphanies all the<br/>
time and on occasion a big one.<br/>
<br/>
Some people will be happy to not have all the pieces to the puzzle, to<br/>
live where they are, in their own little comfort zone of the knowledge<br/>
that they have, completely content there. For me, with something so<br/>
cool and life changing as unschooling, I want more and more and more. I<br/>
want to know all there is to know and learn better and better ways of<br/>
living peacefully with my kids. I&#39;ve ruffled feathers because of my<br/>
unbending stance on it. Everyone is free to live their life how they<br/>
want to, but I don&#39;t have to agree and get along!<br/>
<br/>
The only people who&#39;s judgement I truly care about are my immediate<br/>
family, they are the ones I have to live with and who&#39;s lives are<br/>
directly impacted by what I do. The beauty is, that I&#39;ve met some<br/>
pretty amazing people because of it!-=-<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like religion to me. But I suppose it can&#39;t be helped, because <br/>
in that inspirational life-transforming way, it does have something to <br/>
do with such epiphanal business sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
I was halfway through reading it (the first comment is mine, but I <br/>
mean halfway through the other part when I thought to myself this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;THIS IS GREAT! Who wrote this?&quot;<br/>
Jenny Cyphers. No wonder I made a page about her. She&#39;s all <br/>
inspired and inspiring.<br/>
<br/>
So I quoted that on a page about confidence, and about how confidence <br/>
can seem like arrogance.<br/>

and I linked it from<br/>

&gt; Is it the word &quot;epiphany?&quot; In religion that word speaks to beliefs,<br/>
&gt; miracles and magical transformation. In the absence of religion it<br/>
&gt; more closely speaks to thought, discovery and change. Both can contain<br/>
&gt; overtones of gratitude which often translate as awe, reverence and<br/>
&gt; worshipfulness (or love). I laughed when I put in the word<br/>
&gt; &quot;worshipfulness&quot; there because I heard behind it a little chorus of<br/>
&gt; &quot;we&#39;re not worthy&quot; from Wayne&#39;s World, which we watched last night.<br/>

Not that I said bad.  When comparing things, our dualistic culture <br/>
gives things an either/or flavor and pits them against each other.  I <br/>
try hard to be inclusive when making comparison because everything is <br/>
connected somehow somewhere, but sometimes the wordiness of it all has <br/>
the language grinding the meaning to bits.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just starting to live with the fact that I can&#39;t include everything <br/>
I want to say in one post.  Even when it&#39;s loooonnnng.  It&#39;s just the <br/>
way it is.<br/>

<br/>
Sometimes people are dumped out of their boxes and it destroys them.    <br/>
Death, divorce, unemployment, unpreparedness for change... those can  <br/>
ruin people, mentally and emotionally.<br/>
<br/>
Some people are athletic and strong and brave, and others would rather  <br/>
sit in the shade and watch, or stay home and avoid watching.   Should  <br/>
they all have those choices?<br/>
<br/>
Some people are socially strong and brave and others think the best  <br/>
live that could come to them would be a steady, easy job, a little  <br/>
rented dwelling space to come home to, a car that runs, a TV that  <br/>
works, and enough money to buy food that&#39;s easily prepared and cleaned  <br/>
up after.   For reasons we couldn&#39;t understand and they might not  <br/>
understand, that, for them, is heaven.<br/>
<br/>
If people around them shame and harangue them and say &quot;You shouldn&#39;t  <br/>
be happy there.  You could have a better job.  You could learn to cook  <br/>
gourmet meals!  You should have hobbies.  You should get your nose out  <br/>
of that book and go outside and play...   Now the difference is that  <br/>
the world in which they were content has come to look bad, and wrong.<br/>
<br/>
If someone comes here and says &quot;I want help figuring out how to  <br/>
unschool,&quot; I have some ideas about what she might need, and the more  <br/>
she tells us about the circumstances and personalities involved, the  <br/>
more ideas I&#39;ll have!    She&#39;s expressed a need/desire.<br/>
<br/>
If someone&#39;s happy and doesn&#39;t come here, I don&#39;t know what they  <br/>
need.  Maybe they need nothing more than what they have, and what  <br/>
could be better than that, if they&#39;re not hurting anything or anyone?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-593186372">Sandra how funny that Brian and I just had a talk about something like that.<br/>
We have a friend farmer that has over 100 acres of unbelievable land right in the best part of Rochester MN.<br/>
He lives with his twin brother who is mentally disable and they are both in their early 60&#39;s.<br/>
He has other brothers and sisters around and they are very wealthy.<br/>
He is a very handsome man and must have been even more handsome  years ago.<br/>
The house in the farm has become inhabitable many years ago. They just let it go.<br/>
They now live in what it used to be the  pig house with a wood stove.<br/>
 They have chosen to live very very frugal. They have the bare necessities and that is how they like it.<br/>
They are sitting in a gold mine but despise spending money on stuff .<br/>
$10 for him is a LOT.<br/>
This man reads the newspaper everyday and pretty much knows what is going on around. He is a smart man.<br/>
They do not want anything different. Nothing anyone does or say can change them.<br/>
<br/>
Than I compared that to my sister. A year ago she was glad to send her son to kindergarten and looking forward to sending him to first grade all day. <br/>
They sometimes spanked, they did time outs and she screamed a lot.<br/>
He is one of those super intense, non stop, physical and very intelligent but challenging child.<br/>
I had many , many talks with her and she would agree with all I was saying but was happy to keep doing what she was doing.<br/>
Fast forward today and they pulled him out of school less than two months into 1st Grade and she has tremendously changed. She now sees all the damage school was doing to him and is trying hard to change how she parents him ( a big struggle for her).<br/>
She was content to do what she was doing and nothing I said before changed her mind until she decided/saw that it was not the best for her son. Now she sees it. Now she listens to me ( and is has read your book).<br/>
All this to say that no one cannot change someone that does not want to change.<br/>
No one can really make one see things different if they are not open to it.<br/>
Of course it helped that she knew there were options because of me but really she changed because she was ready and willing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1645161548"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt; They both came in and put all the groceries away and went back to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>what they were doing. It was so sweet, so not coercive, so not<br/>
eye-rolling. Just this generous gift of service. It came with an<br/>
epiphany, an underscoring of these unschooling side effects that I see<br/>
and read about from other people.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, I was trying to remember when it was that Chamille started<br/>
bringing groceries in.  There was a time when she didn&#39;t.  We&#39;d get home<br/>
from shopping and she&#39;d hop out of the car and run into the house with<br/>
or without even grabbing her own things, not even thinking about<br/>
bringing in groceries or helping, or opening or closing doors.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t that she was being mean or disrespectful, she just didn&#39;t even<br/>
think about it, her mind was on something else, what she was going to do<br/>
when she got home, what or who she was going to play with.  Sometimes,<br/>
I&#39;d ask and then she would grab a bag on her way up to the door and drop<br/>
it off there, and sometimes I never got a chance, she&#39;d be gone already.<br/>
<br/>
I would carry everything in, even her stuff.  It never seemed like a big<br/>
deal to me.  Now however, it is rare that I don&#39;t get help, and in fact<br/>
sometimes she does more carrying and putting away than I do, just<br/>
because, and sometimes she&#39;ll even give her little sister a ride from<br/>
the car to the front door.  The sheer fact that she LIKES to go grocery<br/>
shopping with me and in fact gets upset when I go without her, is<br/>
something all in and of itself!  I treasure those shopping trips!<br/>
<br/>
For the life of me, I can&#39;t remember when this transition happened!  But<br/>
there it is, somewhere between the age of 10 and 15, she became very<br/>
helpful to me!</div>

computer, I&#39;m off living life with my kids and my family.<br/>
<br/>

generally really cool about that and do their own morning routines, if<br/>
they are even awake at all!  It helps to get up before them these days,<br/>

I don&#39;t have epiphanies.  Nothing comes to me suddenly and nothing seems like a miracle.  That probably has something to do with being dull witted.&lt;g&gt;  So, no epiphanies, but I get little ideas that hang on and then grow...  or not. &lt;g&gt;   And I get excited about discovery. <br/>

***...in that inspirational life-transforming way, it does have something to <br/>

Schools have made discovery such a step by step exercise in drudgery people don&#39;t remember that discovery used to be something thrilling and life changing.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad some people have sudden comprehension about life changing things when they see their kid in a particular moment.  That&#39;s quick and efficient! &lt;g&gt;  And I know &quot;epiphany&quot; is a prettier, a feelier word. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
