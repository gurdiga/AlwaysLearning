&lt;&lt; I really enjoyed the movie, but I&#39;m sorry and curious about why they <br/>
didn&#39;t <br/>
 say that it was Frodo&#39;s birthday too, and his thirty-third, his coming of <br/>
 age.  They just talk about Bilbo&#39;s birthday, but the really cool thing about <br/>
 that party was it was eleventy-leven for Bilbo AND 33rd for Frodo, right? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, AND...they left out my favorite character......Tom Bombadil!!! Wah. <br/>
And the fact that Frodo left Bag End NINE years after Gandalf left, not days <br/>
later.<br/>
And all the cool stuff between Bag End and the new house...and the <br/>
BarrowWraiths....<br/>
&#39;tis the facts of a book being made into a movie.</div>
