<div id="ygrps-yiv-148409935">I didn&#39;t get the attachments but I have in the past gotten weird repeating <br/>
message or random ones with attachments which the viruses sent, kinda picking <br/>
up phrases from the infected computer.<br/>
<br/>
If it stays set, I&#39;ve changed this list to strip attachments. <br/>
