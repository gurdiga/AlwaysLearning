<div id="ygrps-yiv-1392979766">Hello, <br/>
<br/>
Someone posted a link sometime 2 to 3 weeks ago to a talk that Sandra Dodd and a man who practices Buddhism gave .. I think on the topic of compassion and working with anger too.. does any have that link?  It was an audio file (not video).  I loved the talk and meant to save it, but now I am unable to locate it.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help,<br/>

<br/>
The talk is called &quot;Peaceful Parenting.&quot;<br/>
The page it is on used to be called that, but someone who has tradmarked the phrase &quot;peaceful parenting&quot; (seriously; who approves stuff like that!?) threatened me harshly.   :-)<br/>
<br/>
Now the page it&#39;s on is <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/parentingpeacefully">http://sandradodd.com/parentingpeacefully</a><br/>

It&#39;s at the bottom there, or you can download it for free and play it on your own equipment wherever else.<br/>

before the year 2010 on several blogs that have nothing to do with<br/>

If you wanted to, you could spend a lot of time, money and effort to fight<br/>
that....<br/>

La Leche League has used it in their literature for at least 25 years. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, it&#39;s crazy (and quite un-peaceful), but there it is. :-)<br/>
<br/>
No one can just explain compassion to another person and flip a switch in the other.  Things like this are learned gradually, just as walking, talking, reading and singing are learned gradually, and if it can be from interesting activities and the mom pointing out good examples and bad examples (in a casual everyday way), the children find ways to choose their future actions and responses, gradually.   <br/>
<br/>
Helping children see that they&#39;re making choices and helping them develop tools for making choices that don&#39;t hurt themselves or others is the core of all of unschooling and peaceful parenting.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I believe that I saw the un-peaceful web site and the cute thing is that<br/>
the research that she is using is not even her original research.  If that<br/>
person copyrighted the name of their theory, what would she do?<br/>
sigh.  I am done now.<br/>
