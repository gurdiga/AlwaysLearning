the organization of it!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t help but note an error in a quote.  The following is incorrect.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;There is nothing good or bad, thinking<br/>
makes it so.&quot;  ~Shakespeare<br/>
<br/>
The quote is Hamlet, speaking to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, about  <br/>
whether Denmark is a prison.  They say it&#39;s not, Hamlet says it is.   <br/>
For him, under the circumstances, it feels like a prison.   He says<br/>
&quot;There is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I feel like Roger Rabbit, unable to resist adding the &quot;two bits&quot; to  <br/>
the knocked rhythm of &quot;Shave and a haircut...&quot; but there it is.<br/>
