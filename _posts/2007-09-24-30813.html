<div id="ygrps-yiv-1350275577">Statistical discussion arose from this:<br/>
<br/>
	Subject: 	93% of women do not mention small penis size, for fear of  <br/>
hurting their lovers&#39; feelings<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This mail came to me while I&#39;m doing this&#39;n&#39;that getting ready for a  <br/>
conference (Minneapolis, Saturday) and Marty&#39;s sitting in the room  <br/>
playing Oblivion.<br/>
<br/>
So, we considered...<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s an interesting number and an interesting thought.  Made-up  <br/>
number, no doubt, but the real questions involve who would&#39;ve been  <br/>
these women who were (maybe) asked?<br/>
<br/>
Would that be intended to say that 93 percent of all women who ever  <br/>
had an opportunity to mention small penis size?  Even those who might  <br/>
only have had one lover (it specifies &quot;lover&quot;) and so no basis for  <br/>
comparison?  Those whose partners&#39; penises aren&#39;t small?  Did they  <br/>
somehow find a scientific sample of women whose partners all had  <br/>
notably small penises?<br/>
<br/>
So assuming the last possibility, that it was a good sample and a  <br/>
well-considered question survey:<br/>
<br/>
What about those other seven percent!?  Seven percent weren&#39;t afraid  <br/>
of  hurting the guy&#39;s feelings?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s worth looking at crazy statistics sometimes, and pulling apart  <br/>
goofy claims and premises, because it makes it easier to remember to  <br/>
consider angles and factors when there&#39;s some statistic you&#39;re  <br/>
inclined to be glad you heard.<br/>
<br/>
Statistics about SAT scores or unschoolers in college or income and  <br/>
hours in school or WHATever....   consider before you get too  <br/>
attached to a &quot;proof&quot; or to any numerically-claimed &quot;evidence,&quot; how  <br/>
the numbers and claims came about, and why.<br/>
