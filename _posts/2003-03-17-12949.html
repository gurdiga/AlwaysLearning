<div id="ygrps-yiv-1264071908">Hi Penny!<br/>
<br/>
You asked for us to tell about our kids ages and how long we&#39;ve been <br/>
unschooling, and what a typical day is like?  I&#39;m glad you asked because <br/>
although I have been unschooling for probably 5 years or more, I still <br/>
feel like a newbie!  Ha!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my kids are both boys, ages 5 and 9.  We have been extremely <br/>
low-key these past years, and they spend most of their time playing.  <br/>
And of course, we unschoolers know that playing is a kids&#39; work and <br/>
that&#39;s how they learn.  My kids love imaginary play right now -- they <br/>
are always making up scenarios for their toys and saying stuff like <br/>
&#39;this guy is invisible but he can still carry guns,&#39; or similar things.  <br/>
It&#39;s all in the abilities of the toys.<br/>
<br/>
My older boy also loves legos and will spend literally hours building <br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
I am completely confident that unschooling is the way for us, although <br/>
my husband is not so certain from time to time.  He is quite frustrated <br/>
that Cyrus (9) is not reading right now, but the way I look at it, Cyrus <br/>
actually does read some words and he is picking up more very quickly.<br/>
<br/>
In the last few months I have decided to add a more or less &#39;structured&#39; <br/>
activity to our day and that is to add a designated hour in the middle <br/>
of every day for reading aloud.  I plan to read aloud to the boys right <br/>
after lunch every day because until now, I have reserved bedtime for <br/>
reading, and nowadays once I fall into bed and start reading I fall <br/>
asleep within 5 minutes! lol!  I want them to have stories so I felt <br/>
that I HAD to add that time.<br/>
<br/>
My philosophy is to basically take things one day at a time and see what <br/>
turns up.  I joined this list recently also because I know there is so <br/>
much wisdom and experience here and I want to learn from these people!<br/>
<br/>
Glad to have you here, Penny!<br/>
<br/>

&lt;&lt; Is everyone on this list experienced?  No<br/>
  newbies like me???? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yep, pretty much...:)<br/>
Actually, the list is full of people that are die-hard, pure, radical<br/>
unschoolers. It matters not if your are new, it&#39;s more important that you<br/>
completely embrace unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for letting me know.   I joined to learn about unschooling and <br/>
what<br/>
better place to learn than with the most experienced.<br/>
<br/>
Could everyone tell me how old their children are, how long you have been<br/>
unschooling, and  what a typical day is like?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much!<br/>
<br/>
