The food around here is also very meat and potatoish....buffet lines are <br/>
popular. And a lot of folks vacation here from Michigan....maybe a <br/>
connection? hmmmmmm<br/>
<br/>
I used to get Sopapillas at Taco House in Portland. Always tore off a corner <br/>
and filled it with honey. Haven&#39;t even heard the word Sopapilla since moving <br/>
down South....most of the Mexican restaraunts food tastes like tv dinners.<br/>
Now there&#39;s a whole culture I had forgotten! TV dinners, with those weird <br/>
fruit desserts..yucko. We always got one when a babysitter came...which was <br/>
about once a year thank goodness!!<br/>
