&lt;&lt; Why ARE churches such works of art anyway? <br/>
Couldn&#39;t the $$ be better spent? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The big ones, the Gothic cathedrals, were like transport chambers to God.  <br/>
The music and the architecture and the stained glass were setting up <br/>
vibrations that were like sending God a code that we had figured out some <br/>
classic mathematical patterns and were worthy of contact now.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds stupid, but I really believe it.  The more I read about other <br/>
religions and what sorts of worship spaces they need or find work best, and <br/>
the more I read about early music theory and the more I ponder about the <br/>
physics of sound chambers, I think a Gothic church with a big pipe organ is <br/>
as close to communication with the infinite as our culture has ever come.<br/>
<br/>
And an adobe Catholic church, shaped like a cross, with real gold and real <br/>
imported-from Italy statues, and altar clothes made by  nuns in France, and <br/>
and and...  that induces awe.  And in a state of awe, it&#39;s easier for people <br/>
to feel the presence of God.  A religious experience is harder to come by in <br/>
the absence of awe-inspiring STUFF--objects, space...<br/>
<br/>
Religion can also use special lighting (candles, stained glass) and scent <br/>
(incense, flowers).  It can also use things that move out of the corner of <br/>
your eye.  Banners. Ribbons.  Fluttering robes on priests.  <br/>
<br/>
The banners Methodists and Lutherans keep hanging on the wall are hung badly. <br/>
 They should be hanging away from the wall some so they can move.  Or from <br/>
the ceiling as so many banners were hung in English churches (and I presume <br/>
elsewhere in Europe).<br/>
<br/>
Look at other religious ceremonies in other religions and cultures and look <br/>
for those vibrational things--sound, scent, light, color/ribbon/banner <br/>
(Tibetan prayer flags are Right Up There)--and a pointy space in which to <br/>
commune with God.  Either vaulted ceiling, a clearing in the forest, a spire, <br/>
a cross, a spiked stick--some sort of antenna thing higher than people&#39;s <br/>
heads is not uncommon.  What&#39;s the physical difference between &quot;Om&quot; and <br/>
&quot;Amen&quot; (especially when it&#39;s sung at the end of a hymn, all held out with its <br/>
long &quot;m&quot; and long &quot;n&quot;?  Singers know usually to hold the vowel, but Ammmennn <br/>
is often held on the consonants, so that it&#39;s more humming than vocalizing.  <br/>
Vibrates those bones in your skull, and your whole body).<br/>
