&gt; passive ones, so I limit their TV.***<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mine are 17, 14, and 11 and they have always had unlimited access to tv, <br/>
video, and video games. There have been times they watched a LOT of tv. There <br/>
are times when I&#39;ve seen one of them just turn on the tv when she can&#39;t think <br/>
of anything else to do or when she&#39;s tired and cranky and wants distraction <br/>
or to empty her overactive brain and just calm down. Oh wait, maybe that was <br/>
actually me &lt;BEG&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
We got wireless headphones so my husband can watch sports stuff without the <br/>
rest of us having to listen to it all the time.  I got two sets, so sometimes <br/>
a couple of people will be watching a movie while the rest of us are in the <br/>
same room reading or playing a game or something else.<br/>
<br/>
We have cable with seemingly unlimited channels - there&#39;s almost always <br/>
something good on. I think having so many options actually means we just <br/>
accept it that we&#39;re going to miss good stuff and there&#39;s less concern about <br/>
it. My husband and I and my 14 yo always seem to find time to look through <br/>
the PBS program guide and put a few things on the calendar that we really <br/>
don&#39;t want to miss. She looks because she&#39;s into opera and musical stuff. We <br/>
look for the drama and documentaries.<br/>
<br/>
TV is not a problem at all here. The kids have plenty of other things to do <br/>
and they&#39;d rather do those things unless there is something they want to <br/>
watch on tv. I&#39;d say that my 17 yo watches maybe 2 to 4 hours a week. The 14 <br/>
yo watches probably 4 to 6 hours  a week. The 11 yo watches about 4 to 6 <br/>
hours a week. Some weeks we might watch more - we might watch a bunch of <br/>
movies in one week, for example.  But I&#39;d say that is pretty typical for the <br/>
kids to choose to watch unless their dad or I encourages them to watch <br/>
something with us.<br/>
<br/>
I think that with young kids, though, that they can get &quot;caught up&quot; in <br/>
watching tv, if it is on all the time. And they can get sort of &quot;stuck&quot; and <br/>
not be able to move away from the tv on their own, to find something else to <br/>
do. So you might have to be aware of that and make sure that life is filled <br/>
with interesting and enticing alternatives. Sometimes people complain that <br/>
their kids don&#39;t want to do anything but watch tv and yet it seems like maybe <br/>
their lifestyle isn&#39;t as exciting and attractive as watching tv. I mean - <br/>
what kid would say, &quot;NO I want to watch the Brady Bunch, if you were offering <br/>
to take them out to ride on ponies, for example.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
So- if my kids were choosing to watch what seemed to be excessive amounts of <br/>
tv, I guess I&#39;d want to look really carefully at whether or not I was really <br/>
providing an environment that could compete with tv. In other words, I could <br/>
just turn off the tv -- but that doesn&#39;t improve the kids options, that <br/>
limits them. Why not entice them away by making the other options more <br/>
desirable. I think it is hard for some people to figure out how, when you <br/>
have young children, to keep house, keep clean laundry around, feed <br/>
everybody, and STILL provide a really stimulating environment. It may feel <br/>
like you have to give up on the housekeeping and other things in order to be <br/>
as available as they need. That may be true. It isn&#39;t really &quot;available&quot; if <br/>
you&#39;re just &quot;there&quot; physically in the house, but busy doing laundry and <br/>
washing dishes and so on. <br/>
<br/>
This last stuff may not be the issue at all for the person who posted the <br/>
original question -- just something to consider.<br/>

<br/>
I have seen families who want unschooling to magically appear in the way they <br/>
have imagined it:  The moms do whatever they want on their own, in quietude, <br/>
while the kids energetically reproduce the school&#39;s curriculum in creative <br/>
ways.<br/>
<br/>
In schools, windows are often painted over or covered with children&#39;s art or <br/>
other paper so that kids can&#39;t see out.  WHY!?  Because if there&#39;s an <br/>
alternative to the teacher speaking or the worksheet on the desk, the kids <br/>
might prefer looking out the window.<br/>
<br/>
If looking out the window is more interesting than the worksheet or the <br/>
teacher, it seems logical that the teacher should make what she&#39;s saying more <br/>
interesting, or replace the worksheets with something lively and fascinating.<br/>
<br/>
But no, they cover the windows.<br/>
<br/>
I think some homeschooling parents cover over the TV in the same way.<br/>

cable -- we saw the Holy Grail of Educational TV, ANIMAL PLANET!  I sat<br/>
glued to a show about how birds mark their territories with songs whose<br/>
distinctions are little more than fluctuations in notes, nearly impossible<br/>
for any human to detect.  When our cable company offered high-speed<br/>
internet, with a discount if we upped our TV service to include *digital*<br/>
channels, we gained 6 Discovery channels, a bunch of movie channels,<br/>
including the Independent Film Channel, and BBC America among many others.<br/>

shouldn&#39;t hide it from your child. <br/>

Oh, and covering the windows is awful, wow, I didn&#39;t know they did that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2044130653">Hey Dar! <br/>
<br/>
And does my child think it&#39;s reasonable to not let her smoke cigars? The<br/>
thing is, she&#39;s never tasted one, and I told her that juice through a<br/>
straw tastes much better, and she believed me. She saw an appealing image<br/>
of a crocodile with a cigar in a Russian cartoon, and was intrigued. Later<br/>
I&#39;ll tell her why we don&#39;t smoke, and why it isn&#39;t a good idea. And most<br/>
likely she&#39;ll follow my advice. Or maybe she&#39;ll try it a few times. But <br/>
then she&#39;ll still choose what&#39;s good for her if I do my job well.<br/>
<br/>
So for those of us who think that TV is akin to smoking (and I did find<br/>
some such people), we do make the choice to ditch it for ourselves and for<br/>
our kids. And the rest make a different choice. Does *your* child know how<br/>
good life can be without a TV? No really, what if she would agree with me?<br/>
Not a chance, huh? :-) <br/>

It makes no difference.  If there are 900 ugly magazines and there are five <br/>
that are worth having, get those five.  Don&#39;t condemn Smithsonian because you <br/>
don&#39;t think Lowrider or Rolling Stone should exist.<br/>

just the two of us, and I wouldn&#39;t miss it much, and if I did I could go<br/>
visit someone. It truly wouldn&#39;t be a big deal to me. When we got to<br/>
Mexico for a few days or a week, or go camping, there&#39;s no tv.  And no<br/>
computer, which I miss a lot (anyone want to buy me a laptop?). But I&#39;m<br/>
not about to just get rid of the tv against her wishes so she can<br/>
experience life without it, just like I&#39;m not going to get rid of all the<br/>
reading material in the house to experience life without that, or get rid<br/>
of all the playmobil, or all the games.... <br/>
<br/>
How old is your child, or children? Just wondering. The things you talk<br/>
about doing sound like they&#39;d seem to work with a young child, but would<br/>
blow up in your face once she got a bit older.  At least, that&#39;s what<br/>
I&#39;ve seen. Mine is 9...<br/>

Holly has one (TV/VCR) in her room that she hasn&#39;t turned on for weeks.  I <br/>
