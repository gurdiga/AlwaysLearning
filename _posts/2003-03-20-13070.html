<div id="ygrps-yiv-1712331868">We&#39;ve been playing monopoly jr this morning.  When Lisa ran out of money, I suggested that she borrow some from the bank.  The girls liked that idea.  But I&#39;m not sure if we&#39;re figuring the math right.<br/>
<br/>
Lisa owes $4 to Jackie.  So we gave Jackie $4 from the bank, then gave Lisa $4 from the bank, but she turned it upside down to show that it was $4 in debt.  When she earned $2 passing go, she would then be $2 in debt instead of $4.  I told the girls that the bank would charge interest, but that was too complicated for me to figure out with play money.  <br/>
<br/>
Lisa asked if the real bank would give you upside down money when you borrowed it.  I explained that they give you a piece of paper telling how much you owe.  Maybe we should keep track of the debt on paper, instead of with upside down money.<br/>
<br/>
Any other ideas on this variation?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The way I understand it is the $4 that Lisa has upside down is simply a <br/>
marker or a promissory note.  She can&#39;t spend it.  When she passed go you <br/>
should have taken two of the dollars and put it back in the bank as payment, <br/>
leaving the other $2 for the next trip around the board.  When she passed go <br/>
again and you took the remaining $2, she would then have no money, but she <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be in debt anymore, either.  <br/>
