&lt;&lt; y husband was a reluctant unschooling parent - has come around more and <br/>
more <br/>
 as the kids have gotten older and he sees that their options are not being <br/>
 limited by not schooling them more traditionally. But he &quot;went along&quot; all <br/>
 these years - didn&#39;t really &quot;support.&quot;  He went along because he trusted my <br/>
 judgement, knew that I&#39;d put serious and informed thought into it, knew that <br/>
 I felt strongly and he didn&#39;t. He felt worried and concerned and confused. I <br/>
 tried to allay his fears by letting him in on the reasons I felt strongly <br/>
 about unschooling. And I offered him books or articles to read, but he <br/>
really <br/>
 didn&#39;t want to spend his time learning about it, much - he knew he wasn&#39;t <br/>
 going to change my mind anyway. And his fears and anxieties were minor and, <br/>
 over time, were being laid to rest anyway. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This sounds very much like my home.  Dh is a huge supporter of homeschool <br/>
now, I hear him talk with people and am very much surprised at what comes out <br/>
of his mouth considering he was nervous about homeschooling in the first <br/>
place.<br/>
And now with unschooling....he&#39;ll be the first to admit it has helped our <br/>
marriage, my more relaxed way of living. But he thinks I should be doing a <br/>
little bit of lesson oriented stuff occasionally. <br/>
He thinks they should have chore lists etc....pretty normal for the average <br/>
guy.<br/>
I think it&#39;s come up twice in the last year, both during stressful weeks, and <br/>
he pointed out that the kids weren&#39;t &quot;disciplined&quot; enough which led to a <br/>
heated discussion because I felt defensive.<br/>
But most of the time, he may worry, but he doesn&#39;t say a word.  He knows how <br/>
passionate I am and has decided it&#39;s better for our family to be supportive.<br/>
And he sees them learning new stuff all the time, I think he is slowly being <br/>
convinced.<br/>
We haven&#39;t unschooled completely for very long....I am quite sure he will be <br/>
a verbal supporter of unschooling within a few years.<br/>
