&lt;&lt; Most of our sharing seems to be long distant and not intimate and<br/>
that is so different from much of the world or even our own history.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have more intimate sharings with some of the e-mail friends than I have had <br/>
in the past with neighbors who came over for tea and hung out.  You can live <br/>
a life without &quot;prying&quot; or &quot;gossiping&quot; or sharing, which is like a waterbug <br/>
on the surface of the water.  Is that intimate?  It&#39;s &quot;proper,&quot; and polite, <br/>
and by the etiquette book.<br/>
<br/>
If you read 19th century etiquette books, books about how letters should be <br/>
written, examples of period letters from the Renaissance and forward, one of <br/>
the main points seems to be NOT to really share.   The liveliest letter <br/>
collection I have is Mozart, mostly to his sister,  But he was a hyperactive, <br/>
idiosyncratic nut.  He wasn&#39;t &quot;proper.&quot;  Proper meant talking about as little <br/>
as possible.  Leaving calling cards and using form letters out of a book with <br/>
samples and examples that many people honestly used to copy word for word.<br/>
<br/>
My friend Hannah left the state years ago. Just this morning I got a letter <br/>
from her about her dad&#39;s sudden death, her feelings for her dad, her <br/>
miscarriage (third child) while she was there for the funeral and her thought <br/>
that the baby wanted to be with her dad.  And her sex life, her brother&#39;s <br/>
move in with her (with wife and child), her neighbor who hosts a republican <br/>
rally the same weekend on his land each year as he lets the SCA have a big <br/>
tournament, over the hills, and he takes the Republican fund-raising crowd <br/>
over there to see the SCA tournament, every year.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s some interesting and useful and real stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
Of my neighboroo much and tell their kids to be quiet all the time.  Across <br/>
the cul de sac?  Druggies.  Not too bright.  Not too honest.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps that&#39;s enough for me to know.  (I do know more, but it&#39;s not <br/>
uplifting, not happy, not an addition to my children&#39;s peace and prosperity.)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Is there anything lonelier or more isolated than the typical suburban <br/>
dweller down on<br/>
their luck? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
True in some cases, but there are meetings and churches and for all the <br/>
criticism they get, there are social services people, and there are free <br/>
classes in most communities.<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re way suburban without transportation THAT can be pretty damned <br/>
isolating.<br/>
