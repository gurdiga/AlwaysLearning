<div id="ygrps-yiv-1719180369">Unschooling is amazing!  Well, duh, but...<br/>
<br/>
Aaron is starting to read.  And yesterday he was looking at his candy<br/>
wrapper where it said, &quot;4 to go&quot; and he read it fine and then asked<br/>
what they meant by that.  His sister explained it meant there were 4<br/>
candy bars in the package.<br/>
<br/>
As I thought about it, I realized it doesn&#39;t really follow any phonics<br/>
rules, but he had no trouble with &quot;to&quot; and &quot;go&quot; sounding totally<br/>
different, and maybe that is because we *haven&#39;t* drilled any phonics<br/>
rules at him, so he has no preconceived hang ups.<br/>
<br/>
He also read several candy hearts that his Granny had in a bowl on her<br/>
coffee table.<br/>
