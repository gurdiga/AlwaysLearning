<div id="ygrps-yiv-1666344368">Hey folks! I am on shoe box swap group for homeschoolers. Members   <br/>
swap shoe boxes with other families every month. The owner of the <br/>
group partners the members each month with a different family.  <br/>
Families fill the shoe box with crafts and/or items from thier home <br/>
state or country.  It&#39;s a great way to &quot;meet&quot; other homeschooling <br/>
familes from around the world. And, the more members we have, the <br/>
more swapping we can do!   If you join now, you will be in time for <br/>
the November swap.. we have already paired up this month.  CHECK IT <br/>
OUT!<br/>
