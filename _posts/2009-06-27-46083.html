Deb Lewis once responded to this statement (below to the line):<br/>
***Thank you for trusting this list with personal information like  <br/>
that. It helps me understand you better, and to have more confidence  <br/>
in your advice.***<br/>
<br/>
Anyone can come to my house and meet my kid and talk to him about  <br/>
unschooling. Anyone can see my extensive dust collection, my stupid  <br/>
dog, my hideous, pinching pigeon. That&#39;s all stuff I&#39;ve talked about  <br/>
here. I&#39;m a real person, with a real kid. If I could make my scanner  <br/>
work I&#39;d put his picture up.<br/>
I don&#39;t know how I could help anyone thinking about unschooling if  <br/>
they couldn&#39;t see into my life and as much as it&#39;s possible from an e- <br/>
mail list, see that the words I type are lived out here first, with a  <br/>
genuine kid.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in Deer Lodge, Montana. Anyone can come and visit.<br/>
<br/>
We played at the river yesterday. We threw rocks at floating ice  <br/>
chunks until we couldn&#39;t feel our fingers any more. We had a snowball  <br/>
fight. We went sledding. We watched &quot;Attack of the Crab Monsters&quot; and  <br/>
read about dinosaurs. We played Master Labyrinth and chess. We stood  <br/>
on our heads. We made peanut butter and bird seed surprise for the  <br/>
Flickers.<br/>
<br/>
Today we&#39;re going to Grandma&#39;s house. She&#39;s making fresh tortillas and  <br/>
we&#39;ll visit with Dylan&#39;s uncle because he&#39;s flying back to Anchorage  <br/>
on Monday. We&#39;ll probably watch a movie there, too. I&#39;ll make a pan of  <br/>
fudge to take along.<br/>
<br/>
My real and happy kid says a lot more about unschooling than I could  <br/>
ever convey by analyzing human nature. If I&#39;m afraid to talk about my  <br/>
real unschooling life, how will I single-handedly change the world for  <br/>
the better? I&#39;ve printed out my super hero license and I&#39;ve sewn my  <br/>
Tick suit. Now, Evildoers, Eat My Justice!<br/>

---------------<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know the origins or traditions of TCS, but the sort of sharing  <br/>
I was used to when I started unschooling was La Leche League, which  <br/>
depends entirely on women sharing actual tales of bodily fluids, and  <br/>
nursing babies right in front of other moms, and talking about their  <br/>
children&#39;s functions and unusual traits and particular oddities.   I  <br/>
learned about unschooling from La Leche League leaders at first.  I  <br/>
was in a babysitting co-op made up entirely of LLL members (mostly  <br/>
leaders), and as more of those families put their kids in school, what  <br/>
was left of the group transitioned to being &quot;The Goof Group,&quot; an  <br/>
unschooling park day.<br/>
<br/>
I have always shared.  When I&#39;ve talked to my kids about whether it  <br/>
was okay to share something particular, they&#39;ve almost always said  <br/>
yes.  Sometimes they didn&#39;t, and most of those times they came back  <br/>
later and said &quot;It&#39;s okay if you tell that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So even though someone unfamiliar with this sort of learning (which  <br/>
is, I believe, the natural way women learn from one another about all  <br/>
SORTS of biological and social realities and have since long before  <br/>
writing) was cringing and hoping, my children have known since they  <br/>
were tiny that I had learned cool things from other families and other  <br/>
newer families were learning cool things from knowing and watching and  <br/>
hearing about my kids.  They&#39;ve always seemed quite proud of that  <br/>
fact, and as they speak increasingly on panels at conferences, or  <br/>
Holly&#39;s in the unschooling chats, or on video, I see that they&#39;ve  <br/>
grown up knowing they are living examples of a better way to be.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Years ago when a couple of people from the TCS group/discussions were  <br/>
active at unschooling.com or AOL, we&#39;d ask &quot;like what?&quot; and they had  <br/>
&quot;a rule&quot; (for real) against talking about their real children.  They  <br/>
had decided it wasn&#39;t respectful to tell any stories about anyone else.<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, if someone can&#39;t tell any stories, they have nothing to talk  <br/>
about.  They can read.  They can throw in a philosophical point once  <br/>
in a while, but unless they want to back up their beliefs with  <br/>
evidence, this isn&#39;t the sort of discussion for them.<br/>
<br/>
But I did want to reassure anyone with concerns that the reality of  <br/>
women discussing how it&#39;s going with them and their children and  <br/>
families is  older than unschooling, for definite sure.  Older than  <br/>
&quot;TCS.&quot;  Older than boats.<br/>

for permission, and then ran the post by them for approval, you still  <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s more than &quot;a common stereotype.&quot;  At a basic level, as stripped  <br/>
of culture as you can possibly squint to imagine it, children learn by  <br/>
playing and climbing and asking lots of questions.  Men learn to hunt  <br/>
by hunting and to build by building.  Women learn the nurturing and  <br/>
reproductive information they need to know by talking about it, by  <br/>
sharing examples and discussing what went wrong or right.<br/>
<br/>
Men don&#39;t need to talk a lot to hunt together.  They need to be pretty  <br/>
quiet, in fact.<br/>
Women need to talk to remember and communicate where they saw those  <br/>
yams growing, near where the berries were.<br/>
<br/>
-=-It makes me cringe because I believe it is rude to share the intimate<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s find for you to cringe, and it&#39;s fine for you to believe that,  <br/>
but it&#39;s not okay for you to try to shame us into doing what would  <br/>
make you more comfortable.  You can think the worst possible things  <br/>
about me but it won&#39;t change the peace and joy of my family.  No one  <br/>
can take away the fact that Holly will be 18 in the fall and my kids  <br/>
didn&#39;t go to school, and they read and they write and they are  <br/>
respected by people younger, and their age, and older.  (Unless I made  <br/>
them up, I mean...  And if I made them up who CARES what stories I  <br/>
told about them?)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Common courtesy&quot; isn&#39;t common (shared) if one group has a tradition  <br/>
of sharing while another group considers it taboo.<br/>

<br/>
Radio talk shows beat them to that.  Counseling groups and church  <br/>
groups where women share with strangers came decades before.  AA/al- <br/>
Anon/Nar-Anon, those are sharing intimately with strangers.  They  <br/>
don&#39;t use their full names and they ask that the stories stay there.   <br/>
Except for cases of court-ordered attendance, most people there are  <br/>
there voluntarily, and they can pass.<br/>
<br/>
No one has ever been court-ordered to participate in an unschooling  <br/>
discussion.<br/>
<br/>
If someone takes what I&#39;ve written about my children and does  <br/>
something evil with it, that is their transgression and discourtesy.<br/>
<br/>
My purpose in telling these stories is not to show off or to pass  <br/>
time.  I&#39;m sharing situations in which the philosophy by which we live  <br/>
has created a certain kind of outcome which is not likely to occur  <br/>
from other choices.   I&#39;m sharing particular parts of my life for  <br/>
particular reasons.   I&#39;m not indiscriminately choosing three things a  <br/>
day to tell without consideration for whether they have to do with  <br/>
unschooling or not.   I&#39;m not sharing randomly or thoughtlessly.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; strangers? Wouldn&#39;t one want to speak differently in these two very<br/>
&gt; different situations?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have met a lot of the people that write in unschooling forums, IRL. <br/>
Does that change the dynamic at all?  I put faces and body language to<br/>
people that I&#39;ve been familiar with for a long time online only.  I can<br/>
hear their voices and imagine the smiles they have.<br/>
<br/>
If I were speaking with one of them IRL, I&#39;d probably being saying more<br/>
and gesturing lots, since I do that, and they&#39;d likely get way more<br/>
details than what I share online.<br/>
<br/>
There have only been a few times that I haven&#39;t shared something because<br/>
the details are personal.  That is common courtesy.  I don&#39;t want to be<br/>
a rumor mill and sometimes talking about details can do that.  I&#39;ve done<br/>
it unintentionally before.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading and writing in these online forums for so long now,<br/>
that all the names and writing styles are familiar to me, familiar like<br/>
old friends are.  When I went to the Life Is Good Conference, everyone<br/>
knew who Chamille was because I write about her.  She was surprised that<br/>
people came and talked to her, simply because of that.  It made her feel<br/>
welcomed and loved.  If I&#39;d never shared details about her, nobody would<br/>
have done that!  It was the same for Margaux, but she didn&#39;t notice as<br/>
much because she assumes everyone will like her and talk to her.<br/>
<br/>
Chamille has a boyfriend that she met because of an online friendship<br/>
with a complete stranger that happened to live nearby.  She has very<br/>
good online friends that she met online and IM&#39;s and talks on the phone<br/>
with.  Some of them, she&#39;s met IRL and some of them she only knows<br/>
online.  She rarely hides her real self or the details of her real self,<br/>
none of her social profiles are set to private.  She doesn&#39;t talk to<br/>
just anybody.  She accpets friend requests based on lots of different<br/>
factors and rejects friend requests based on lots of other factors.<br/>
<br/>
The ways in which she views relationships are very different than the<br/>
way I grew up.  I only made friends with people nearby, in school,<br/>
church, and my neighborhood.  Chamille makes friends with people that<br/>
she has things in common with, wether they are nearby or across the<br/>
planet.  The only way to know that she has things in common is to share<br/>
the details.</div>

different language. I am not. I think it&#39;s interesting how people choose <br/>
to behave on the internet, and interesting to see how it&#39;s changed the <br/>
boundaries of what is considered public and what is considered private.<br/>
I think it&#39;s an interesting topic of discussion and an interesting <br/>
evolution in how humans behave.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, I make my own choices about what to read and write, as does <br/>
everyone on this list! And I&#39;m here, and I&#39;m reading and writing... you <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-324737514">That&#39;s one of the interesting things to me, how compelling virtual <br/>
interaction is. Stripped of our physical bodies, clothes, and <br/>
surroundings, we meet here or other virtual places using our words and <br/>
whatever other pieces of our reality we construct and show on facebook, <br/>
blogs, etc. And even with just that little bit of each other, we have <br/>
the sense that we know and understand each other and can share lives and <br/>
experiences in a meaningful way.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s an amazing testament to human creativity, both on the part of those <br/>
who are doing the sharing and those who are experiencing it. And it&#39;s <br/>
totally shaking the foundations of human social interaction, which have <br/>
traditionally been based on all kinds of physical world cues to inform <br/>
us of status and our relative place in the world (not to mention the <br/>
incredible shrinking world).<br/>
<br/>
Our children are growing up in a very different world, and they are <br/>
creating the social norms and customs for this world at the same time <br/>
they are inventing it.<br/>

Those who you have met IRL, did they seems like themselves?<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have met a lot of the people that write in unschooling forums, IRL.<br/>
&gt; Does that change the dynamic at all? I put faces and body language to<br/>
&gt; people that I&#39;ve been familiar with for a long time online only. I can<br/>
&gt; hear their voices and imagine the smiles they have.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If I were speaking with one of them IRL, I&#39;d probably being saying more<br/>
&gt; and gesturing lots, since I do that, and they&#39;d likely get way more<br/>
&gt; details than what I share online.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There have only been a few times that I haven&#39;t shared something because<br/>
&gt; the details are personal. That is common courtesy. I don&#39;t want to be<br/>
&gt; a rumor mill and sometimes talking about details can do that. I&#39;ve done<br/>
&gt; it unintentionally before.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been reading and writing in these online forums for so long now,<br/>
&gt; that all the names and writing styles are familiar to me, familiar like<br/>
&gt; old friends are. When I went to the Life Is Good Conference, everyone<br/>
&gt; knew who Chamille was because I write about her. She was surprised that<br/>
&gt; people came and talked to her, simply because of that. It made her feel<br/>
&gt; welcomed and loved. If I&#39;d never shared details about her, nobody would<br/>
&gt; have done that! It was the same for Margaux, but she didn&#39;t notice as<br/>
&gt; much because she assumes everyone will like her and talk to her.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Chamille has a boyfriend that she met because of an online friendship<br/>
&gt; with a complete stranger that happened to live nearby. She has very<br/>
&gt; good online friends that she met online and IM&#39;s and talks on the phone<br/>
&gt; with. Some of them, she&#39;s met IRL and some of them she only knows<br/>
&gt; online. She rarely hides her real self or the details of her real self,<br/>
&gt; none of her social profiles are set to private. She doesn&#39;t talk to<br/>
&gt; just anybody. She accpets friend requests based on lots of different<br/>
&gt; factors and rejects friend requests based on lots of other factors.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The ways in which she views relationships are very different than the<br/>
&gt; way I grew up. I only made friends with people nearby, in school,<br/>
&gt; church, and my neighborhood. Chamille makes friends with people that<br/>
&gt; she has things in common with, wether they are nearby or across the<br/>
&gt; planet. The only way to know that she has things in common is to share<br/>
&gt; the details. </span></blockquote></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-105993651">It&#39;s more than &quot;a common stereotype.&quot;  At a basic level, as stripped  <br/>
of culture as you can possibly squint to imagine it, children learn by  <br/>
playing and climbing and asking lots of questions.  Men learn to hunt  <br/>
by hunting and to build by building.  Women learn the nurturing and  <br/>
reproductive information they need to know by talking about it, by  <br/>
sharing examples and discussing what went wrong or right.<br/>
<br/>
Men don&#39;t need to talk a lot to hunt together.  They need to be pretty  <br/>
quiet, in fact.<br/>
Women need to talk to remember and communicate where they saw those  <br/>
yams growing, near where the berries were.<br/>

What Sandra wrote reminded me of a  group of Japanese macaques who were studied I don&#39;t know when ago. Japanese macaques wash their food, like raccoons. In this group of macaques one female discovered that she could get the sand from rice by throwing it all in a creek and then scooping up the rice after the sand fell to the bottom of the creek. The researchers recorded the transmission of that knowledge and found that first all other macaques in Imo&#39;s age group learned the sand technique and then their mother&#39;s learned it and showed to their other children and last, and sometimes not at all, it was the older males who learned to use running water to separate grain and sand. <br/>

often share (with other men)  intimate details of their lives, trading <br/>
concerns and offering supportive and/or helpful commentary. Some of you <br/>
know men who do that, I&#39;m sure, but they are exceptions. What &quot;I&quot; notice <br/>
is that men are more likely to do that when there is a woman around who <br/>
gets it going, but pretty unlikely to initiate it on their own. My <br/>
husband has close friends of 20 or 25 years with whom he talks sports <br/>
and business and they even talk about their families, but they do not <br/>
analyze and share details of things they are concerned about, not at all <br/>
in the ways that are common among women. I am a statistician and <br/>
economist and have worked for years and years in a field in which I am <br/>
very often one of the few women in a group. Even in business, get a <br/>
group of mothers together and they will talk about their children - <br/>
their needs, their problems, their concerns. I honestly do not think I <br/>
have ever once been in a group of professional men - having lunch or <br/>
dinner, for example, and heard that kind of talk.  In fact, working <br/>
mothers seem desperate to talk about their children, men mostly seem to <br/>
have other things on their minds.<br/>

Roxana is applying for a scholarship - the above is the essay question. <br/>
They are scoring based on: writing ability, creativity, originality, and <br/>
overall excellence. Equal weight on each of those. If there is a tie, <br/>
the winner will be one with the higher score in the &quot;overall excellence&quot; <br/>

So - she&#39;s stumped. We thought maybe this would be an interesting thing <br/>

You are implying that we &#39;have the sense&quot; but it isn&#39;t real? We have the sense that we understand each other and can share lives and experiences in a meaningful way? YOU may be fakin&#39; it here, but I know I don&#39;t just have the &quot;sense&quot; that we are sharing in meaningful ways, I know we actually, in fact, ARE sharing lives and experiences in meaningful ways. People&#39;s lives are being changed in very significant ways - this isn&#39;t like the relationship I have with most of the people in my neighborhood where we wave at each other and ask how the kids are doing. No - THOSE are the superficial relationships I have - even though I know what kind of house they live in and what they look like and what clothing they wear - even though I can see those things about them, that doesn&#39;t contribute to more meaningful sharing - not at all. Maybe the opposite, in fact.<br/>
<br/>
My kids, by the way, trust me to use my good judgment about what to say in public online in the same way I use my good judgment about what to say in public anywhere else. Because we talk quite openly about our kids, don&#39;t assume that we necessarily would blabber on about things to which they&#39;d object.<br/>
<br/>
Roxana says, &quot;If you don&#39;t mention me by name when you&#39;re talking about me, online, it is harder for me to google myself.&quot;&lt;G&gt;  My kids LOVE reading the things I wrote about them when they were younger and they are very very happy to have been of use in discussions that might have helped other kids have happier lives.

Perhaps you have not met anyone on this list, but I&#39;ve met over a  <br/>
hundred of them, and it&#39;s really none of your business what I thought  <br/>
of whether they were the same in person as they had seemed on the list.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re going to ask a theoretical question, couch it in qualified  <br/>
phrases.<br/>
<br/>
#2, Was it a test, then?  Did you want stories without names?  MANY of  <br/>
us would recognize even stories without names.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-5481994"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Those who you have met IRL, did they seems like themselves?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not Jenny, but I&#39;d like to answer this as I have met lots of people IRL<br/>
after &quot;getting to know&quot; them online.<br/>
<br/>
Overwhelmingly, the people I have met - mostly through Yahoo groups that<br/>
I&#39;ve been on and then kind of striking up an online off-list friendship,<br/>
then eventually meeting up when I&#39;m in their area or they are in mine - seem<br/>
just like themselves when we meet IRL.  Several of them actually say &quot;I<br/>
can&#39;t believe how much you seem like YOU!&quot;  Or &quot;You&#39;re just how I expected<br/>
you to be.&quot;  This is not surprising to me, since I think I write much like I<br/>
speak.<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I first met over a text-based chat program at our small<br/>
college (less than 800 students).  We chatted for several hours a day for 3<br/>
days before we met in person.  This was in 1995.<br/>
<br/>
For the past several years I&#39;ve lived in a small town or rural area and have<br/>
been increasingly less and less social IRL.  I have been thinking about how<br/>
my in-person social skills have diminished and while I don&#39;t like it, I&#39;m at<br/>
least glad to have the opportunity to meet and interact with people online.<br/>
As much as I would love to live amongst a thriving group of like-minded<br/>
people, I simply don&#39;t.  If I didn&#39;t have online friends and groups with<br/>
which to pursue my interests, my life would be much, much less fun.  I do<br/>
try to &quot;practice&quot; social stuff in person as much as I can/want to, and it<br/>
will get easier when my two year old doesn&#39;t require so much chasing!  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-253626381">-=-I&#39;m still back on the idea that not being able to see our physical<br/>
bodies, clothing, and the kind of house we live in leaves just &quot;bits&quot; of<br/>
ourselves. Physical appearance and economic status are important bits?<br/>
Seriously?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s the most glorious part of discussions like these, that  <br/>
someone&#39;s ideas have a strength and life separate from their BMW and  <br/>
nice house, or untainted by their rusty 25 year old Toyota truck and  <br/>
their apartment shared with college roommates.<br/>

<br/>
&lt; If that causes someone to feel shame, that is their own shame, and <br/>
doesn&#39;t have anything to do with me. &gt;<br/>
<br/>
. I doubt anybody here really cares that it makes you cringe, but if you <br/>
were someone they cared about (their parent or other loved one, for <br/>
example), then saying, that their behavior makes you cringe would be <br/>
shaming and, yes, it would indeed have something to do with you.<br/>
<br/>
So - you don&#39;t like it that people talk openly about their families and <br/>
you don&#39;t feel responsible for the effect of your own words. Interesting <br/>
bits.<br/>

<br/>
An English sonnet may be an unconventional (and extraordinarily nerdy) <br/>
choice for a scholarship essay, but I&#39;ve never been a conventional <br/>
person (though, I&#39;ve always been a nerd). As I considered the question <br/>
of what moment I would &quot;do over,&quot; I kept thinking of Shakespeare&#39;s line <br/>
about man being the sum total of his experiences. That was what I wanted <br/>
to express - I can&#39;t change or redo anything in my past, because without <br/>
even the worst moments of my life, I would not be who I am today. Well, <br/>
I decided, the sonnet form worked pretty well for Shakespeare, so why <br/>
not for me? Therefore, without further ado (much of it about nothing), <br/>
here is<br/>
<br/>
      &quot;Scholarship Sonnet No. 1&quot;<br/>
<br/>
               To choose a moment that I&#39;d want to be<br/>
<br/>
Redone; one day that I could try again,<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like the stuff of sci-fi books to me--<br/>
<br/>
And we all know how those plots always end!<br/>
<br/>
            My life is not a list of past regrets,<br/>
<br/>
Of things I wish undone or blush to hear.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d not unmeet one person that I&#39;ve met,<br/>
<br/>
Nor throw away a day, a week, a year.<br/>
<br/>
            I am the sum of all that&#39;s in my past,<br/>
<br/>
Not just the good, I also am the bad,<br/>
<br/>
Despite the times I wished to get through fast,<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t regret the life that I have had.<br/>
<br/>
            No person&#39;s perfect, every life is mixed:<br/>
<br/>
            No moment would I wish gone, changed, or fixed.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Roxana is applying for a scholarship - the above is the essay question.<br/>
&gt; They are scoring based on: writing ability, creativity, originality, and<br/>
&gt; overall excellence. Equal weight on each of those. If there is a tie,<br/>
&gt; the winner will be one with the higher score in the &quot;overall excellence&quot;<br/>
&gt; category.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So - she&#39;s stumped. We thought maybe this would be an interesting thing<br/>
&gt; for this list - not directly about unschooling except that MY first<br/>
&gt; answer was that the reason she&#39;s so completely stumped is because she&#39;s<br/>
&gt; unschooled and therefore had no &quot;school years.&quot; Even if we change the<br/>
&gt; question to say &quot;childhood&quot; instead of &quot;school years,&quot; she&#39;s still<br/>
&gt; feeling completely stumped.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So - if you were in the place of an unschooled kid, what kinds of<br/>
&gt; moments or events might you come up with for this?<br/>

I will ask that you *not* reply to other posts offlist.<br/>
