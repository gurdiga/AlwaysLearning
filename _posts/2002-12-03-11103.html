<div id="ygrps-yiv-777267648">Today I had to sleep off my over-exertion, and mid-afternoon my husband <br/>
called to check on me.  I said &quot;Bring me a People magazine, a banana, and a <br/>
bag of orange Milanos.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
He said, &quot;This is worse than when you were pregnant.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I said, &quot;Just do it.  Thanks.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s the Sexiest Man alive issue.  On guy and 106 runners-up/honorable <br/>
mention.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Viggo Mortensen?  No.   Well, next year maybe.<br/>
<br/>
But Alan Rickman has a page.  They quote Ruby Wax:  &quot;He knows how to turn on <br/>
some sex thing onstage or on film that just wipes out an audience.&quot;  And <br/>
Heidi Klum said &quot;He has a very sexy voice.  It&#39;s dark and yummy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There is one Lord of the Rings guy:  Karl Urban, who will play Eomer.  I had <br/>
told my kids the other day that the guy going to play Eomer was on Xena.  <br/>
Marty said, &quot;Mom, just about everybody who was on Xena is in Lord of the <br/>
Rings.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Oh. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The beefcake &quot;winner&quot; this year is Ben Affleck.   I just lately watched <br/>
Chasing Amy for the first time, so I&#39;m all for it.  And I also hadn&#39;t seen <br/>
Armageddon until after I broke my leg and videos and DVDs became my constant <br/>
companions.  Maybe I&#39;ll rent Pearl Harbor.  Maybe I won&#39;t.  Good Will Hunting <br/>
(which I have seen several times) is in the Netflix queue already.<br/>
<br/>
(I wouldn&#39;t be up this early if I hadn&#39;t been in and out of nappishness all <br/>
afternoon Monday, and it&#39;s noiseily [that is an unspellable word] raining <br/>
outside.)<br/>

Well, I thought the movie was atrocious. But if you get the DVD, the History <br/>
Channel program on Pearl Harbor is great!<br/>

<br/>
The power of geography!  Both Xena and LOTR were filmed in New Zealand,<br/>
so lots of jobs for actors from those parts.<br/>

Have you seen him in &quot;Changing Lanes&quot;? Dh and I just saw that a couple nights <br/>
ago....it was an interesting concept.<br/>
Two men collide on the freeway and it ends up turning into this drawn out <br/>
fued, good movie over all.<br/>

&quot;The answers aren&#39;t important really...<br/>
What&#39;s important,  is knowing all the questions.&quot;<br/>
