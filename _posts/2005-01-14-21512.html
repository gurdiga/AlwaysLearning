<div id="ygrps-yiv-184335200">hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I keep hearing &#39;Can you dig it?&#39; over and over and over! I just went through<br/>
this last week with &#39;Bye Bye Bye&#39; my son will play one song over and over<br/>
again till he feels had has enough of it, then will start all over again. It<br/>
is coming up to an hour for Raven&#39;s &#39;Grazing in the Grass&#39; song, he says it<br/>
is hard to picture her singing that song, he keeps seeing meercats singing<br/>
it.<br/>
I didn&#39;t realize, till I noticed him doing it, that I do the same exact<br/>
thing, although I use headphones. I usually do that to help get me through<br/>
cleaning (I really do not like doing dishes) - that definitely goes back to<br/>
when I was a kid, could not listen to music while doing chores. hmmm, or<br/>
pretty much anytime for that matter. My son will read, draw or help with<br/>
cleaning up while listening to his music. I am glad I am not like my mother<br/>
and yeah, I CAN dig it! LOL<br/>
<br/>
We have been moving forward on our sleep cycle, not something I like to do<br/>
in winter but any other time of the year is great. My son is such an owl,<br/>
night time is when he is more interested in finding out things, discovering,<br/>
asking about anything and everything - and hey, you can&#39;t fight that right?<br/>
; )<br/>
But starting my day between the hours of 2pm and 11pm makes me all loopy,<br/>
cannot function as well as I would like. I eat way too much and just feel<br/>
lousy. My son has really made it quite memorable for me this time though, he<br/>
has been giving me pointers on how to play the different classes on Star<br/>
Wars Battlefront on x-box. I started off in the Ladybug (novice) level of<br/>
knowledge and now I am at the Butterfly level, very soon he says I will make<br/>
the Black Widow level. Final test of my abilities, he says, is to go up<br/>
against him, yikes! he is REALLY good! lol<br/>
<br/>
I saw the sun today - I have not seen that since Christmas eve. Boy, when<br/>
our town does cloudy, it really goes all out! We have had a snow storm, icy<br/>
rain, flooding and rain, rain, rain! yuck!<br/>
We had a power outage last week, from like 9pm to 4am - thankfully it stayed<br/>
above freezing that night. We read from a strategy guide (we had an oil lamp<br/>
on) brought out the emergency radio, listened to a Jon Anderson interview,<br/>
played with candle wax for hours, found the &#39;80s station (my son asked how<br/>
on earth did I know all the songs that came on). When the &#39;Eye of the Tiger&#39;<br/>
came on he said he knew that song - he remembered &#39;The Rye or the Kaiser&#39; by<br/>
Weird Al, lol. He was amazed by how many songs he knew from the &#39;80s - a lot<br/>
have been put into movies he has seen.<br/>
<br/>
OOOH! before I forget! just FYI, Huygens probe is landing on Titan tonight,<br/>
well it said live at 9pm est. we were watching the science channel (love<br/>
that channel!) this morning and it is just amazing the pictures of Saturn<br/>
that the Cassini satellite sent back. and a big GRRRR! we will have to wait<br/>
to see that at 5am, we went to sleep about 2pm yesterday so I am thinking 3<br/>
maybe 4pm today - completely forgot about the probe when we started the<br/>
sleep change. I thought about waking a bit before 9 to see it but we are<br/>
getting to that wonderful waking hour where I can once again function, and<br/>
no longer be (and look like) a zombie! LOL<br/>
<br/>
well, getting sleepy now<br/>
<br/>
have a great day everyone<br/>
<br/>

The big game this week here has been Karaoke something (Karaoke  Revolution?) <br/>
for X-Box.  Kids come over every night to play it.  Marty  owns $15 worth of <br/>
this one and has to pass it on to other co-owners soon.   There&#39;s a song there <br/>
(maybe two) that work just as well if the kids sing the  Weird Al words as <br/>
the real words, because it&#39;s only hearing if you come in at  the right time and <br/>
on pitch.  Words don&#39;t make a difference.<br/>
 <br/>
One song I&#39;ve always known better (or maybe just liked better so I  <br/>
consciously forgot the original words) was Another One Rides the Bus (instead of  ... <br/>
bites the dust).<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;HEY!  He&#39;s gonna sit by you!<br/>
Another Rides the Bus...&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
I love Weird Al.  Kirby and Marty have been invite back stage after  concerts <br/>
two different times.  I&#39;ve seen two concerts (not those same two;  the kids <br/>
have seen him three times).  GREAT concerts.<br/>

Recently, we took Logan and his cousin  to a Weird Al concert.  I  was just <br/>
amazed at how great his concert was and the wide range of ages of the  people <br/>
attending. It was one of the best I&#39;ve ever been to and Broc and I had a  great <br/>
time.  Very loud though...did concerts used to be so loud?   :-)<br/>
 <br/>
Love his songs and he&#39;s even better live.  Once when I was missing New  <br/>
Mexico, Logan played the &quot;Albuquerque&quot; song for me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-732210231">Yes! Weird Al rules! Just this week, John heard Queen&#39;s &quot;Another One Bites the <br/>
Dust&quot; and burst out laughing when he told me he liked Weird Al&#39;s version <br/>
better. We&#39;ve seen him three times, went backstage a couple of times and got <br/>
some great photos of James (husband) and John (son) with Weird Al. John&#39;s <br/>
drumming teacher told him to listen to Weird Al, especially early Weird Al, <br/>
and pay attention to the drumming because it&#39;s really good. Is that cool, or <br/>
what?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-570690265">I used to listen to weird Al in high school almost twenty years ago.  I<br/>
can&#39;t believe he&#39;s still giving concerts.  I loved him.  I used to make up<br/>
my own lyrics in my head sometimes to songs and in my high school days I<br/>
thought I was almost as talented as weird Al in the lyric department.  LOL!<br/>
