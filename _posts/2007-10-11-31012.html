<div id="ygrps-yiv-582096044">Hi. I am usually a lurker but I have a question. My kids, husband and I <br/>
found some bones by the railroad tracks on an outing. We believe they <br/>
are from a few different animals. Some are rib bones, we have a small <br/>
lower jaw bone, various appendage bones but we are unable to identify <br/>
the animal(s). Does anyone know how we can begin to identify what the <br/>
bones are then maybe figure out the animals they came from? We think <br/>
that maybe a coyote or the red tailed hawks that live in are area may <br/>
have something to do with it. They are realatively old, we think. Any <br/>
info would be great for my future palentologist.<br/>
<br/>
thanks, tyra</div>

Maybe  not a great idea. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Go where the discussion is about bones, please.   Talking about where  <br/>
you found answers (and how Nancy searched for sites) is great.   <br/>
Bringing the WHOLE discussion here goes off topic.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
