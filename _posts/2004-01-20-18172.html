<div id="ygrps-yiv-731864901">** So she&#39;s probably going to make her daughter use cloth pads. What a way to<br/>
turn her against them for life. Yes, there are some problems with tampons,<br/>
particularly the bleached ones. If I were just starting out rather than<br/>
essentially finished, I would be looking at alternatives.**<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know, honestly. That wasn&#39;t the concern she expressed to me, it was <br/>
that she feels tampons are for sexually active women and that young girls <br/>
should definitely not be thinking about putting anything into their vaginas. She <br/>
planned to tell her daughter that tampons are for adults period - hence the need <br/>
for a book that doesn&#39;t mention tampon use for teens. <br/>

broken inserting a tampon. That&#39;s *if* it&#39;s an issue. It wouldn&#39;t be with me.<br/>
