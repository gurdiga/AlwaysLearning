<div id="ygrps-yiv-757573768">I have tried and tried to come up with ideas on how to deal with our current<br/>
issue. I have even written this email two or three times with different<br/>
words and changed my mind on sending it, thinking that we could be creative<br/>
and come up with something ourselves, but I think I need an outside POV.<br/>
Even writing this email I feel like I am being selfish and that I should be<br/>
able to come up with a solution.<br/>
<br/>
There are 4 of us in our family. DH and I plus Marti (8) and Lilly (almost<br/>
5). Marti likes playing by herself a lot these days and really likes staying<br/>
at home. She rarely willingly likes to go anywhere. The rest of us love to<br/>
be out and about. Lilly gets way bored just staying home all the time, as do<br/>
DH and I. We often find ourselves catering to Marti, but then feeling torn<br/>
because that isn&#39;t fair to the rest of us, especially Lilly. Yesterday, we<br/>
took an hour and 15 minute bus ride to a park that we haven&#39;t been to since<br/>
last fall. We were there an hour and Marti wanted to go home. Lilly didn&#39;t.<br/>
We ended up going home to appease Marti.<br/>
<br/>
How do we respect Marti&#39;s needs and still respect Lilly&#39;s needs? I know that<br/>
one of us (adults) could stay home with Marti while the other went out with<br/>
Lilly. There are about 3 hours per night that we are all up and here and<br/>
that doesn&#39;t include getting dinner. By the time DH gets up (3rd shift)<br/>
Lilly is already bored to tears. I try to play with her, but she tires of me<br/>
and I just can&#39;t fulfill her need to play by myself. Marti doesn&#39;t want to<br/>
play with her either.<br/>
<br/>
Having only three hours also doesn&#39;t leave room for much. Lilly is a variety<br/>
snob, lol! If we go to the same place very often she easily gets bored with<br/>
it and being that we are dependent on the city bus, it takes us up to 4<br/>
times as long to get someplace as it would if we had a vehicle. That ties up<br/>
the 3 hours, and then some.<br/>
<br/>
So, on one hand, I have Marti who, it seems, doesn&#39;t want to go anywhere or<br/>
do anything. I have even tried &quot;bribing&quot; (although I don&#39;t think of it as<br/>
bribing), but that only works every so often with her. On the other, I have<br/>
Lilly who loves to be busy and play. I just can&#39;t seem to do both. I&#39;m torn.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1316170213">We have to do a lot of splitting up at our house because our kids are 7<br/>
yrs apart and have so very different needs.  I can relate to how<br/>
difficult it is to meet everyone&#39;s needs.  What I&#39;ve come to realize is<br/>
that you can&#39;t always meet everyone&#39;s needs, but in the act of trying<br/>
to, you do end up meeting some.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s okay to not always meet needs, sometimes things just don&#39;t work<br/>
out, it&#39;s a part of life.  If you are actively trying though, and it&#39;s<br/>
something that your family focuses on, meeting each other&#39;s needs, then<br/>
that in and of itself makes things better.  When a kid knows without a<br/>
doubt that you as the parent will do whatever it takes to find a way,<br/>
it&#39;s so much easier to handle it when something doesn&#39;t pan out.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually the kids will be older and more understanding of each other&#39;s<br/>
needs.  Their needs may change too, it could reverse.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, you can do little things to alleviate frustration or<br/>
boredom.  Can the more active child take a class or two?  You could<br/>
potentially drop off that child and head on home, or run other errands<br/>
that will free up time for the stay at home child to stay at home.<br/>
<br/>
For a while, I was able to stay up late with one child and get up early<br/>
with the other.  Now I share time with hubby with  each individual<br/>
child.  It&#39;s not ideal, but it works.  He&#39;d prefer we all hang out<br/>
together all the time, but that doesn&#39;t work when you have one kid who<br/>
needs more stimulus, so we do what is best for the kids.  Afterall,<br/>
we&#39;ll get time together for many many years after the kids move on.</div>

Unfortunately we don&#39;t have the income to make this happen.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
I am sure you have thought of this but I am wondering if you have asked them<br/>
for<br/>
solutions?Kelli<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
I have. Lilly is really too young to understand and problem solve here.<br/>
Marti just tells me &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;.<br/>
<br/>

to, you do end up meeting some.<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
This was really difficult yesterday and usually all the time we go out and<br/>
about. Lilly wants to stay at the park. Marti wants to leave. If we don&#39;t<br/>
leave Marti sits/lays right next to us and complains the whole time. If we<br/>
leave Lilly gets mad (understandably) and refuses to walk to the bus stop<br/>
(which isn&#39;t always near enough to carry her the whole way).<br/>
<br/>

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
I understand the thought here, but without a car it doesn&#39;t happen that way.<br/>
By the time we would get home, it would be time to leave. Makes running<br/>
errands hard too. We haven&#39;t run errands in five months, lol!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
For a while, I was able to stay up late with one child and get up early<br/>

we&#39;ll get time together for many many years after the kids move on.<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
And that is the part that feels selfish, somewhat. I need family time and<br/>
time with my dh and time without my kids or I will go insane and I will take<br/>
them with me. LOL! Okay, I was exaggerating, a bit. I kindda knew someone<br/>
would say this, but it kindda feels that that means someone (whoever it may<br/>
be) has to &quot;take one for the team&quot;. It feels like all that will breed is<br/>
resentment. It&#39;s hard for me to want to stay home with Marti when I could go<br/>
out. I have never (even since I was a small child) been able to stay home<br/>
for more than a day or two without going stir crazy.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
How about having a friend of Lilly&#39;s come over to play with her at your<br/>
place more often?<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
This helps. We have had a girl that is more Marti&#39;s age, but has interests<br/>
similar to Lilly&#39;s here last week and this week, but she goes back to school<br/>
next week. We also had a cousin here with us this week and that helped as<br/>
well. But, school is starting soon. All the homeschoolers in our area are<br/>
the curriculum type. Plus, if we have &quot;playdates&quot; we end up with more than 1<br/>
kid here and being that our house is so small we end up with chaos.<br/>
<br/>
I am considering seeing if I can find a child around Lilly&#39;s age to come<br/>
over one or two days a week while mom works, or whatever. I have to explore<br/>
that option a little more and see what I can come up with because I don&#39;t<br/>
want more than 1 kid or chaos reigns and fights break out.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the ideas so far. Keep them coming!<br/>

two days a week, every week, as a solution that supports her needs.<br/>

Put together some enticing activities and invite other girls over -  <br/>
see who she clicks with. Do different things. Have parties. Have book  <br/>
discussions. Have ATC trades. Have a stuffed animals olympics. Be  <br/>

<br/>
Maybe there are easier questions that he would be able to help you with.<br/>
<br/>
Is there something she can think of that he would enjoy doing quietly<br/>
at the park while her sister plays?  Books, some sort of hand held<br/>
gaming, card games with you, oragami, laptop computer (if you have<br/>
one), a picnic, art supplies... maybe she can think of things that<br/>
would make her comfortable staying a little longer.<br/>
<br/>
What parts of going out are hardest for her... the bus?  the crowds?<br/>
the noise?  Maybe you can figure out things to do together that don&#39;t<br/>
wear her out as quickly.  You can call places (zoos, the library,<br/>
etc.) and ask them when things are the least crowded.  I found out<br/>
that our local zoo doesn&#39;t have school groups on Mondays.  I enjoy the<br/>
zoo a lot more when there aren&#39;t school groups there.  I love the zoo<br/>
when it is rainy and cold... we are almost the only ones there.<br/>
<br/>
Lilly might not be old enough for big problem solving, but perhaps you<br/>
could ask her what kinds of things she likes to do at home.  Also,<br/>
what does she like about going out... seeing people?  running around?<br/>
new things?   That could help you figure out how best to make home<br/>
more fun to her and how to get the most out of outings for her.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps a babysitting swap would work.  You may have a friend who<br/>
would love to hang out at your house reading a book while you take<br/>
Lilly and their child to the park.  Your babysitting idea sounds very<br/>
good too: it sounds like money is tight now, and it could help Lilly<br/>
have more social time while bringing in a little money.  That might be<br/>
great for the family.  If what she likes is playing with other kids it<br/>
could really help.  If what she wants is new things, then it probably<br/>
isn&#39;t the best solution.</div>

Amanda -<br/>
<br/>
My son (9) prefers to be home; my daughter (6) prefers to be out. <br/>
What has helped for us is to have &quot;stay at home&quot; and &quot;go out&quot; days<br/>
designated on our calendar.  Most of the time we alternate between<br/>
going out and staying home so my son can decompress and so my daughter<br/>
has some variety of activities each week.  <br/>
<br/>
If we&#39;re going to be out several days in a row I try to ensure that<br/>
our &quot;at home&quot; day is extremely peaceful for my son.  I keep his sister<br/>

food, and generally try to help him fill up with peace and contentment.<br/>

Having our schedule on the calendar, sometimes in hourly detail, helps<br/>
my son be a tiny bit more flexible.  Sometimes I even put travel time<br/>
into the calendar so he can see that we&#39;re not going out til noon and<br/>
expect to be back by six - then he knows he has three hours to do his<br/>
thing before we have to go and six-ish hours after we get back.  The<br/>
calendar also helps my daughter - knowing we&#39;ll be out tomorrow makes<br/>
staying home today less of a trial. <br/>
<br/>
If he has trouble participating in the activity I try to find him a<br/>
place and/or object to keep him happier.  He spent the first couple<br/>
sessions of our co-op sitting in a deep dark closet with his Nintendo<br/>
DS; he subsequently became more comfortable in the environment and<br/>
participates more often.  Sometimes adding in another activity he<br/>
likes is helpful; if he knows we can go to Gamestop, look at Legos in<br/>
Toys R Us, or scooter in the park he can muster a bit more flexibility<br/>
to get through an activity in which he has no particular interest.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;  The rest of us love to be out and about. Lilly gets way bored<br/>
just staying home all the time, as do DH and I. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re lucky, in a sense, because my husband has a similar temperament<br/>
to my son - hubby is totally willing to stay home with son on days<br/>
when he&#39;s not working.  I think it would be hard to be the only<br/>
different one in a family...  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-754354236">Interesting that you write this Alyson.  I have a 2.5 yr old Dd and a 5.5 yr<br/>
old Ds.  Recently we&#39;ve had trouble with my meeting both their needs.<br/>
Without being too wordy... as there are tons of circumstances/reasons<br/>
leading to this ... i want to share our solution:<br/>
<br/>
Ds is at present in a lego, video and home based activity mode.  Dd is in<br/>
lets go out mode.  So we decided to alternate... after a busy dh filled<br/>
w&#39;end we take a breather on monday and stay home.  i keep dd occupied while<br/>
ds gets to tinker with stuff.  Then tuesdays and thursdays become outside<br/>
days.... While initially ds struggled with this idea... eventually he saw<br/>
that it meant he got tons of time at home.  plus i was making sure that home<br/>
day were really home days... no errands or anything.  also when we went<br/>
out... i offerd to carry a small box of lego, or whatever costume ds wanted<br/>
or something like this.  Mostly though he ends up enjoying himself... and if<br/>
he does&#39;nt he asks to leave... so then i usually talk to him about how much<br/>
more time we need to be outdoors to keeo it fair for dd.<br/>
<br/>
Also outside for us means hanging out downstairs or very locally.  about<br/>
once in a week or two we have to do long haul stuff.  Also w&#39;ends when dh is<br/>
home... the kids tend to do a lot of out and in stuff ... so things are<br/>
usually balanced out... but generally no one complains because we all have<br/>
fun hanging out together.<br/>
<br/>
anyway...  hope you find a common space for all 4 of you to hang out at<br/>
Amanda!<br/>
Peace, hema<br/>

&gt; My son (9) prefers to be home; my daughter (6) prefers to be out.<br/>
&gt; What has helped for us is to have &quot;stay at home&quot; and &quot;go out&quot; days<br/>
&gt; designated on our calendar. Most of the time we alternate between<br/>
&gt; going out and staying home so my son can decompress and so my daughter<br/>
&gt; has some variety of activities each week.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If we&#39;re going to be out several days in a row I try to ensure that<br/>
&gt; our &quot;at home&quot; day is extremely peaceful for my son. I keep his sister<br/>
&gt; busy with activities so he can work without distraction, I bring him<br/>

is near a place to do grocery shopping and then drop her off and buy<br/>
food, then pick her up and go home.  As someone who has relied on public<br/>
transportation in the past, I know how this works, I&#39;m not shooting off<br/>
about something I know nothing about.  You clearly live in an area that<br/>
is urban enough to have public transportation, which will have shops and<br/>
malls and businesses, sometimes all in one general location, find one<br/>
that&#39;s accessible and find an activity for your child to do and while<br/>
out, do other necessary stuff.<br/>
<br/>
What about library programs?  Libraries are nice quiet places where one<br/>
child could go and hole up in a chair and read and the other child could<br/>
participate in an activity.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Perhaps you need to let go of the idea that only one child will work.  I<br/>
have a really small house too.  I have 2 kids, 2 cats, and a dog, a home<br/>
business and a lot of hobbies.  Our house is completely maxxed out to<br/>
capacity.  Have your guests limit themselves to one or 2 areas and let<br/>
them go and play and make a big mess unhindered.  Guide their activity<br/>
to an extent that they won&#39;t fight, or help them navigate that.  It<br/>
isn&#39;t a good idea to let a group of 4, 5, and 6 year olds to completely<br/>
play without adult supervision.  If the alternative to big messy<br/>
peaceful play with you involved, is to have 2 miserable children, I&#39;d go<br/>
with the first option.  Don&#39;t let chaos happen.  Don&#39;t let fights<br/>
happen.  Help them play happily.  The idea is to provide something fun<br/>
for one child so that the other may stay at home, so do that.</div>

Be engaged with her! This &quot;If we don&#39;t leave Marti sits/lays right next<br/>
to us and complains the whole time.&quot; implies a lot of disengagement.<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
We do try to engage her, but apparently not in the right ways. (Is that a<br/>
better way to say but, Pam? and I really do mean it. I am not just saying<br/>
it).<br/>

So true. We talked yesterday and she expressed this frustration as well.<br/>
<br/>

We haven&#39;t run errands in five months, lol!<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
How do you do grocery shopping?<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
DH works at Wal-Mart so he usually just brings the things we need home from<br/>
work. Not the greatest arrangement since I don&#39;t like Wal-Mart all that<br/>
much, but we only have a few more months to be dependent on the bus<br/>
(hopefully). But I do understand what you are meaning and I will look to see<br/>
what I can find.<br/>
<br/>

It isn&#39;t a good idea to let a group of 4, 5, and 6 year olds to completely<br/>

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
Just wanted to be clear that it&#39;s not &quot;without adult supervision&quot;. Well, to<br/>
the best extent possible anyway. Marti has this one particular friend who<br/>
comes over with her brother and her sister sometimes. G is 6 or 7, R is 4<br/>
and M is 2. They are constantly up and down the stairs, outside (which<br/>
absolutely has to be supervised as there is no fence), in the kitchen asking<br/>
for food/drinks, etc. I have tried limiting them. Last time we went with<br/>
&quot;stay outside&quot;. LOL! So, did not work. I know that is just one example, but<br/>
that is what makes me want to say 1 or 2 kids tops. I also made a mistake<br/>
and exaggerated with the chaos and fights line. They don&#39;t really fight and<br/>
it just feels really chaotic with everyone running everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the ideas and responses and making me think, everyone.<br/>
