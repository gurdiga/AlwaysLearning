I hope you can find her someone closer than I am.  I&#39;m a ways across the<br/>
Bay from her, in Benicia.  (Maybe a 40-50 minute drive.)  I mention<br/>
myself  because I have a just-turned nine year old boy and I&#39;m new in<br/>
town, so I&#39;m more than usually desperate for friends.<br/>

I live in Marin, and am pretty active in the largest HSing support group in the <br/>
county. Our group has around 60 families who use a wide variety of <br/>
homeschooling methods; we&#39;re not strictly unschoolers, though some <br/>
members use that approach. If she&#39;s already contacted our group, and has <br/>
decided we aren&#39;t her cup of tea, I&#39;m not sure what good will come from giving <br/>
her contact info that will simply direct her back to us.<br/>
<br/>
I reread the paragraph you included, and she sounds somewhat stressed, <br/>
understandably. She mentions that the homeschoolers here tend to keep to <br/>
themselves. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m curious as to whether she&#39;s come to park days or parent meetings (the last <br/>
one was at my house), and what she expects of people she&#39;s just met, but I <br/>
really cannot picture anyone who belongs to our group not lending a <br/>
sympathetic ear or trying to help or advise a new homeschooler if that person <br/>
has concerns. Getting to know new people is a two-way street, and being the <br/>
new person in a group of people who already know each other can be <br/>
somewhat intimidating. It takes time for both sides to reach a comfortable <br/>
place. <br/>
<br/>
And quite honestly, if she&#39;s looking for &quot;free-thinking&quot; and &quot;left winged&quot; ours is <br/>
the group for her.  When I pulled my kids out of school after 3 years, I could <br/>
count on one hand the number of women that I had met through school who I <br/>
felt I was on the same wavelength with. When I joined our homeschooling <br/>
group, I thought that I&#39;d died and gone to heaven, because I finally had the <br/>
opportunity to socialize with other moms who read a lot, think about important <br/>
things, and march to the beat of a different drummer. <br/>
<br/>
If she knows of our group, maybe she needs to meet a wider variety of our <br/>
members and have some patience about forming friendships before she <br/>
decides we won&#39;t meet her needs, especially if she&#39;s new to homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
She can email me if she wants to. I&#39;d be happy to talk with her.<br/>

&lt;&lt;I live in Marin County California (near San Francisco).  Homeschooling<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I noticed that Nancy has responded, here&#39;s my quarter anyway.  on Friday<br/>
mornings The Planet in Mill Valley is the place for homeschoolers that your<br/>
son and you would get along famously with.<br/>
<br/>
Every city/town should have a Planet!  As you head up hiway 101 from the<br/>
city get off at the first exit for Mill Valley, turn right and then right<br/>
again , you should be there.  The kids and I would walk up from the Main<br/>
Dock Houseboat area every Friday morning.<br/>
<br/>
The planet is a place where fun is. My boys made wooden pinball machines,<br/>
cars, swords, a skateboard anything wooden, using all hand tools.  Also to<br/>
be made in another room is anything to do with beads, then there are remote<br/>
control cars, a big grassy area just to be, etc...<br/>
<br/>
On Tuesdays in the morning, parents and kids meet at the park in Fairfax.  A<br/>
fair amount of the families when I was there worked with Pixars.    So I<br/>
don&#39;t know if the park thing is still going, but the Panet is.<br/>
