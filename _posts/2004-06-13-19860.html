I do know now how much she disagrees with our choice. I didn&#39;t really<br/>
know until now and it&#39;s been 8 yrs. She still doesn&#39;t know what she is<br/>
talking about.<br/>
===========<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s godmother is a friend who hung out with me nearly every day in the <br/>
years when Kirby and Marty were born.  And when Holly was a baby, Kirby didn&#39;t <br/>
go to kindergarten, but that wasn&#39;t a big deal.  She knew that if Kirby wanted <br/>
to, or if things didn&#39;t go well, he could go to kindergarten the next year, or <br/>
to 1st grade. So the first year &quot;didn&#39;t count.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My friend was a pre-school teacher for the deaf.  Her whole identity was <br/>
being a teacher.<br/>
<br/>
When she found out we really LIKED unschooling and when she found out Kirby <br/>
was staying home for a second year, she said Something strangely hateful.  She <br/>
said &quot;You&#39;re homeschooling for YOUR benefit, not for Kirby&#39;s.  You&#39;re being <br/>
selfish.&quot; (might not be exact words, but 95% right, if I&#39;ve forgotten a little; <br/>
&quot;selfish&quot; and  the idea that it was for me and not Kirby were in there).<br/>
<br/>
I had an infant and a three year old that season.  It&#39;s not like staying with <br/>
Kirby was keeping me from being in medical school, y&#39;know, or climbing Mt. <br/>
Everest.  I was going to be home anyway.  So I honestly had no idea what she was <br/>
talking about.  It seemed she was grasping for mean-straws.<br/>
<br/>
We only very occasionally have hung out since then.  She couldn&#39;t support <br/>
what we were doing.   And I didn&#39;t really need the judgmental snarkiness of <br/>
someone who honestly had NO reason to look at what we were doing without <br/>
teacher-glasses on.  So I was occasionally a little bit sad, and usually not at all.<br/>
<br/>
She retired from teaching this year.  Maybe when her investment fades she&#39;ll <br/>
be back around.  That might be nice for Holly, but no notable thing for me.<br/>
<br/>
If our children are our priotiries, its easier for us to let others fall <br/>
away.  Anyone who tried to get me to do so much as nod and agree with her/him at <br/>
the expense of my beliefs or of my children was just outathere.  I stood my <br/>
ground.<br/>
<br/>
But there are ways to soften the situation.  I never set an absolute on it.  <br/>
I would say &quot;If it turns out it&#39;s not working, he can go to school,&quot; or &quot;We&#39;ll <br/>
just do it as long as it seems to be the best thing.&quot;<br/>

dare - grin)<br/>
<br/>
My daughter was recently told that she was still nursing her almost 2 year <br/>
old and her 3 1/2 year old in order to feel needed. Yeah right . . . sigh.<br/>
<br/>
My son&#39;s girlfriend&#39;s mother was just fired from her barbering job because <br/>
she &quot;puts her kids first&quot;. Her boss has a 2 and a 4 and spends almost no <br/>
time with them. If her daycare person calls her at work about something, <br/>
she says that they&#39;re being paid to take care of that stuff. She doesn&#39;t <br/>
want to hear if her kids are having problems. This in a small town that <br/>
just lost 4 young people to alcohol/drugs in the last week.<br/>

**My bil&#39;s a teacher (and also an unschooling dad),and he hears comments<br/>
like,&quot;From 8 to 3 he&#39;s your problem.  Don&#39;t call me, just deal with him.&quot;<br/>
all the time :0(.  ~Rue<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2034630075">When Nick was born, I was going to stay home just for 6 months or so<br/>
and then go back to my career. Then it stretched into a year. And then<br/>
it was until he went to preschool. Well, because of this and that<br/>
(late potty training and, in retrospect, the fact that neither he nor<br/>
I were really into preschool/schooling - although we didn&#39;t exactly<br/>
know it at the time), he never went to preschool. Then I heard about<br/>
homeschooling and immediately knew this was what we wanted to try. But<br/>
even to this day (he&#39;s now 11), we still say that we&#39;re going to<br/>
homeschool &quot;as long as it seems to be working out.&quot; The question now<br/>
seems to be whether or not he&#39;s going to high school. And I say, &quot;I<br/>
don&#39;t know. It&#39;ll be up to him.&quot; Who knows? We take it as it comes...<br/>
