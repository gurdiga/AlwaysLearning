<div id="ygrps-yiv-1206044070">Well here we are in the middle of Tropical Storm Hannah. The wind is a <br/>
blowin&#39; and we&#39;re supposed to get 8 inches of rain. Our little pond in back <br/>
is full to bursting!<br/>
Are you getting any of this Sharon?<br/>
It&#39;s been a while since we&#39;ve had a storm, so it&#39;s kinda exciting. As long as <br/>
none of our huge pine trees fall on the house :)<br/>
I see our garbage can has been knocked over and all the garbage is out, but I <br/>
don&#39;t want to walk out there to get it. I&#39;m being a wimp!<br/>
Life in Florida.....ain&#39;t it grand?<br/>

<br/>
But it will be gone soon and you&#39;ll have someone else&#39;s garbage, right?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We pick our neighbors&#39; pieces of trash out of our side yard because of the <br/>
direction of wind and such here.  So I do get to see some school papers and <br/>
notes from teachers, and I wish they would learn to use trash bags instead of <br/>
just putting their lives loose in the dumpster.<br/>
<br/>
I hope the storm spared all your trees and windows.<br/>
