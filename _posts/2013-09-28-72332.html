<div id="ygrps-yiv-1968636410">2 of my kids wanted to try school this year. &nbsp;One is in 2nd grade and loves it right now, My older one, who went to 4 th grade changes her mind from day to day. &nbsp;She knows she can quit but she is still trying to decide. &nbsp;In the meantime she is enjoying some of the social things but hating all the work. &nbsp;She is unhappy with her grades. She keeps calling herself stupid. She was even told by the librarian she couldn&#39;t choose the book she wanted cause it was to hard. &nbsp;In the meantime I am trying to find a way to be at peace with this while she works it all out and also help her. &nbsp;I know there was a thread about this before but can&#39;t find it with the new format. &nbsp;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1905771235"><p>My eldest daughter has gone to school. &nbsp;she went all of last year and has just started again for this year. &nbsp;she did primary school when she was 8-9 years for 2 terms and decided to leave. &nbsp;she wants to stay at secondary because she loves the social side of it all. &nbsp;my daughter also knows she can quit at anytime. &nbsp;i find my daughter has up and down times. &nbsp;she complains about the work, the teachers and the pupils. &nbsp;i listen and sympathise as i would for a friend and ask if she wants advice. i give her hugs , i let her vent. &nbsp;she works it through but it is hard for me. &nbsp;she is 12 and her hormones come into play too...don&#39;t know how old your dd is as i don&#39;t know grades. &nbsp;i let her know that she can come out whenever but at the moment her need to be there is strong. &nbsp;she&#39;s doing great in english and average in her other subjects, but does wobble sometimes about other&#39;s and their grades. i remind her that the grades don&#39;t bother me. &nbsp;she is a bit &quot;rebellious&quot;. &nbsp;she tows the line in the main but there are areas where she sees the injustices and one day i think she may just shout out about them. :-)</p><p><br></p><p>hth</p><p>blessings</p><p>michelle</p> <div class="ygrps-yiv-1905771235ygroups-quoted"><br><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> ---In alwayslearning@yahoogroups.com, &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br><br><div id="ygrps-yiv-1905771235ygrps-yiv-1953359341">I hope someone will find the other topic you&#39;re remembering, but in the meantime, a link and an idea:  Take her to the public library and let her get any books she wants, and there might be ideas here:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice">http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice</a></div>
