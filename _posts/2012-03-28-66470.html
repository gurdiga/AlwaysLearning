<div id="ygrps-yiv-1889908369">I&#39;ve been playing Draw Something all week, and have been writing with my<br/>
 finger on an iPad, so I just did it.  No stylus, but &quot;sign with your <br/>
finger.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have a 3 year old.  Does anyone use an ipad with their three year olds?  Or, can your 3 year old work the computer mouse yet?  I&#39;d love some interactive games on an ipad.  I&#39;ve also heard Kindle Fire&#39;s are good,  but can you use your fingers like an ipad?<br/>

 <br/>
I know heaps of people who have ipads and ipods for their 3-year-olds,they can easily navigate the screen.<br/>
 <br/>
== Or, can your 3 year old work the computer mouse yet?==<br/>
 <br/>
Personally, my son was around 3.5 - 4 when he mastered the mouse, but I didn&#39;t really try it much before then - I would just give it a go, and help them out if they are having trouble. Sorry, I don&#39;t know about Kindle. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-179133007">My daughter received an iPad as a gift when she was 2.5, she can do all sorts of things on there.  My daughter doesn&#39;t like the mouse usually uses the touch pad on the laptop. <br/>
There are so many wonderful apps fruit ninja, write words, toggle, my daughter loves the Dora apps<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-270100945">My niece has had an ipad since she was 2, and her younger brother since he was a baby.  Both of them have had no trouble using them from a really early age.  I only wish they’d been around when my daughter was that age!  Amazing how much of a difference just 4 years can make.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-486363079">My daughter became very interested in using the ipad and computer at age 3.  Now at 4, she can navigate the ipad almost as well as I can - find her own games, turn off wifi (so those annoying popup, &quot;buy me&quot; ads don&#39;t show, etc.)  She loves the apps by TOCA BOCA.  Basically, you can pretend to be a chef, hair stylist, doctor, etc. We also found one that illustrates American Sign Language and she enjoys trying to make the letters with her hands.<br/>
As far as the regular computer goes, she is able to manipulate the mouse at this age, as well, and enjoys sesamestreet.org <br/>
We also recently discovered the astronomy lessons on the Khan Academy site and have fun learning about stars.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was reading &quot;Don&#39;t Bother Me Mom - I&#39;m Learning&quot; by Mark Promsky which is a book that addresses conventional concerns about video game play.  In it, the author talks about Natives vs Immigrants in regards to technological literacy.  He says unlike us, our children are Digital Natives.  We are Digital Immigrants...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;As with all immigrants, some of us have adapted to our new digital environment more quickly than others.  But no matter how fluent we become, all Digital Immigrants retain, to some degree, our &#39;accent,&#39; i.e. our foot in the past.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think that is why some of us wonder *can* a three year old navigate an iPad or use a mouse...because we still have our accent :)  What I have witnessed, though, is that kids seem to pick these things up almost like walking or talking.  It seems to be just another part of learning to interact in the world around them.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-187226697">We haven&#39;t encouraged or discouraged computer and ipad (and iphone) use but are happy to answer their questions or let them play at typing.  The girls are 4 & 6.  In January I started researching and downloading ipad apps specifically for them.  They enjoy the ipad so much I&#39;m considering getting them each and ipad 2 now that the new ones are out the older ones are cheaper and still just as magical.<br/>
<br/>
My favorite site for app reviews for kids is<br/>
<br/>
www.smartappsforkids.com<br/>
<br/>
Every time I try to navigate itunes&#39; app store I get overwhelmed so I find reviews very helpful and this site the most helpful of all.<br/>
<br/>
Aloha,<br/>

PS:  You might want to start with Bugs and Buttons and some ebooks - things you can look at with her and then, once she&#39;s a little more comfortable, she can take over.<br/>
