<div id="ygrps-yiv-1258695464">From the list: Central Texas Intentional Community:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This group is for the discussion and development of an Intentional <br/>
Community in Central Texas. The focus will be on raising our <br/>
children with the concepts of Taking Children Seriously (TCS) and <br/>
Unschooling in a communal living situation. Interested parties will <br/>
have at least one adult member of the familiy be earning an income. <br/>
Single parents are welcome. Members will be interested in <br/>
intentional community living and raising children without coercion. <br/>
Members will either already have children or will be planning to <br/>
have children at some point AND be pro-homeschooling/unschooling, <br/>
thus familiar with the concepts of child-led learning, and TCS. Join <br/>
us in the discussion.<br/>
