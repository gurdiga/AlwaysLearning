<div id="ygrps-yiv-1647521288">I have another question...as I said in my other post, my dh is under <br/>
extreme mental stress and in the last 9 months, since I&#39;ve stopped <br/>
enforcing a bedtime and began sleeping downstairs with all the girls, dh <br/>
and I never get to really be together alone to talk or watch movies or <br/>
anything.  What&#39;s the happy medium between always being there for your <br/>
kids and giving your spouse the attention that he needs, too.  It&#39;s <br/>
gotten so bad that I hardly even know what he does during the day at <br/>
all.  It really putting a lot of stress on our marriage.  How do all of <br/>
you find time for just the grown-ups?  Thanks.   Heidi  <br/>
<br/>
P.S.  As for as the no bedtimes and the co-sleeping, dh doesn&#39;t agree, <br/>
but doesn&#39;t argue.  He also doesn&#39;t fully support unschooling, but he&#39;s <br/>
leaving it up to me.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-134256906">Hello Heidi,<br/>
<br/>
I can relate to your posts, since my husband and I just argued about this <br/>
this past weekend. What we&#39;ve been doing for years is to make one night a week, <br/>
usually a weekend night, our &quot;date&quot; night. We tell the kids they have to stay <br/>
out of the room during the movie and don&#39;t interuppt unless it&#39;s a fire, <br/>
earthquake, flood or other natural disaster. ;) We usually get chinese food for our <br/>
date and enjoy ourselves. The reason we do not go out much is for a once a <br/>
week date, that can get expensive, and we&#39;re a large family living in one income. <br/>
Now....what&#39;s the deal with you sleeping downstairs with the girls? I hope <br/>
everythings okay that way. I sometimes sleep on the couch, but it&#39;s only because <br/>
I want to stay up really late and don&#39;t want to bother him. <br/>
Anyway, make it a priority to do something together once a week (at least). I <br/>
hope it works out for you!!<br/>
:) Amy<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1367658292">Amy, the one night/a week movie would be great, except I have a 1 yr old <br/>
that the older girls, 7 & 5, can handle for a little while, but not the <br/>
length of a movie.   Hiring  a sitter is too pricey for us with our <br/>
finances and the four girls.<br/>
<br/>
The deal with our sleeping arrangement is this: I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s <br/>
ever okay to not answer a child&#39;s cry at night, and I believe in <br/>
co-sleeping with babies...and I have four children.  So by the time I <br/>
had Leiren, the forth, I was bed-hopping so much at night, with the <br/>
baby, that I would wake up and not know where I was, plus dh would get <br/>
woken up every time in jumped in or out of our bed.  He&#39;s a farmer and <br/>
desperately needs good sleep or he could get hurt at work.  We put a <br/>
full-size bed in our library for when my grandmother came to visit and <br/>
it was still here, so the girls and I just started sleeping there.  It&#39;s <br/>
been awesome!  They&#39;re comfortable going to sleep when they&#39;re tired and <br/>
they&#39;re not scared of being alone, because I&#39;m downstairs with them and <br/>
whenever they wake up (anytime 9-12) they wake up right next to all the <br/>
activity, they just join in.  One of the best parts is since we started, <br/>
I now get to sleep ALL night, and for the first time in 7 years feel <br/>
like I&#39;m getting enough rest.  I&#39;ve been able to cut way back on my <br/>
coffee.  Technically, I wasn&#39;t really sleeping in the bed with dh <br/>
before, and all of our nights were disruptive.  Now it&#39;s just a lot <br/>
better :)<br/>
<br/>
Have the Happiest of Holidays!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1696886909">I used to go to sleep with a kid (or two or three) and nursing them would <br/>
knock me RIGHT out,but after a few hours when I woke up I would go and wake my <br/>
husband up in a way that he didn&#39;t mind, and we&#39;d have some alone time and that <br/>
would knock me right out, and so I got two short yet deep sleeps, and he <br/>
preferred a 2:00 or 3:00 a.m. visitation to none at all.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t cover movies and conversation, though.  That we did in the car, <br/>
or by watching movies we could watch with the kids.<br/>
<br/>
Now that the kids are older, we&#39;ve had two &quot;disagreements&quot; where I made a <br/>
suggestion (complained &lt;g&gt;) and he got angry.  Both were the same thing, and both <br/>
recent.<br/>
<br/>
With kids there, where we&#39;re all in one place and could potentially be having <br/>
fun, he has started on some long story about someone at work whose job <br/>
involves this or that project management and... and it&#39;s too removed and boring for <br/>
ME, and means absolutely nothing whatsoever to the kids present (once Holly <br/>
and her friend in the car, and once Holly and Marty at the dinner table) so <br/>
they&#39;re completely shut out of the conversation and end up zoning out their <br/>
individual ways or wandering off.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think parents&#39; &quot;along time&quot; should come when the kids are there.<br/>
<br/>
I had a male friend who had a girlfriend who had a little girl.  He broke up <br/>
with her after a while, because when he would come over, she would make her <br/>
little girl stay in her room the whole time, and he couldn&#39;t relax or feel good <br/>
knowing that he was the catalyst for their separation and that little girl&#39;s <br/>
unhappiness.  And would the girl EVER have liked Bob?  She probably hated him <br/>
passionately because she was banished from his presence (by her mom).<br/>
<br/>
We traded babysitting with other families when the kids were little, and so <br/>
it was not like being sent to a babysitter, it was just like going to play with <br/>
their friends, so we were able to get dinner-date opportunities or boring <br/>
shopping opportunities that way, and the kids didn&#39;t feel shunted off at all.<br/>
