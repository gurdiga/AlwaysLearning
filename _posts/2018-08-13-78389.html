This has links to two new or upgraded or revamped pages on my site.  The blog it’s on, you could subscribe to—it’s all announcements, just one or three a month.   Each post has three (more or less) links, and there are 523 posts there, so…. 1500+ on my blog or somewhere closely related to that :-)<br/>
<br/>
There is a randomizer.  It mght be fun, and you’re likely to see something you never saw before, or had forgotten.<br/>

Things do look different after some time passes and experience grows!<br/>
