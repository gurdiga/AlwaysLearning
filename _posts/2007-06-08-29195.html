<div id="ygrps-yiv-1397955528">Both my sons ( 24 and 101/2) were into knives around age 7 and very <br/>
fascinated with any type of weapon.<br/>
We bought my older son ( we weren&#39;t unschoolers then) a pocket knife when he <br/>
was 7. It meant the world to him. He cut his finger on the very first day <br/>
using it...even under supervision. He didn&#39;t use it too much after that but it <br/>
meant the world to him that we got it for him.<br/>
 <br/>
My younger son, who we unschool , got one at that same age cuz he wanted it. <br/>
Again, he doesn&#39;t use it that much but is so happy he has it. He knows knife <br/>
safety and the story about his older brother &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;.<br/>
He also loves pouring over websites that have all kinds of weapons. It just <br/>
interests him.<br/>
 <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t worry about what others think. Support his interest...investigate <br/>
knives and other weapons with him...on the internet...in books, at places etc. <br/>
Encourage him to learn more about all of them and their history, etc. And <br/>
learn safety. <br/>

My son, Lewi is 7. At the moment he has a real fascination for, and <br/>
interest, in knives. As much as I possibly can I have been nurturing <br/>
this interest. I&#39;m finding it difficult though because of the safety <br/>
issues involved. He likes the look of sharp blades and is interested <br/>
in what they&#39;re used for. He constantly admires the ones in our <br/>
kitchen drawers and gets them out and puts them on our bread boards <br/>
to look at.I&#39;m very present with him when he&#39;s handling the knives <br/>
and have given lots of info about how to handle them safely etc. <br/>
<br/>
There are a couple of things that concern me. One is the reactions <br/>
I&#39;m getting from others who aren&#39;t understanding why he&#39;d be <br/>
interested in something like a knife. They have alot of fear about it <br/>
(which I totally understand) and have questioned him and me about <br/>
why the interest is there. The other is my concern for his safety and <br/>
the safety of others if he happens to show them the knives. I trust <br/>
that he won&#39;t do anything dangerous with them on purpose and again, <br/>
I&#39;m very present when this is happening, but am worried nonetheless, <br/>
that an accident could happen. Not sure where my boundaries need to <br/>
be with it all. I&#39;ve talked to him about the inportance of not <br/>
walking around with them etc and that the drawer is a really safe <br/>
spot for them unless we&#39;re cutting up vegies etc with them. <br/>
<br/>
He also desperately wants to purchase big types of knives -at the <br/>
moment it&#39;s a machette. We&#39;ve had lots of discussion about this, and <br/>
that will continue. I&#39;m really feeling like I need to say no to alot <br/>
of these sorts of things though because of his age. We&#39;ve been into <br/>
the King Of Knives store (while we were in Sydney) and he found a <br/>
sword letter opener that he wants to buy. This would be safe as it&#39;s <br/>
not really sharp. We&#39;re talking about getting a small pocket knife as <br/>
well. My dad has found him an antique scythe that he&#39;s going to hang <br/>
up on his wall in his room and we&#39;ve been to Allens and got a nice <br/>
new knife set for the kitchen which includes a meat cleaver <br/>
(something he&#39;s loved for awhile now). I&#39;m feeling like I&#39;m doing as <br/>
much as I can to help him get what he needs but the machette etc <br/>
feels like it&#39;s way too much at the moment. He&#39;s very upset about my <br/>
decision and my saying no to it. I guess I just needed to hear what <br/>
some of your thoughts are on this and whether I could handle this in <br/>
a much better way.<br/>
<br/>
thanks so much<br/>

Fire, Credit Cards... it&#39;s all fascinating to a kid. My first comment to<br/>
folks is &quot;Don&#39;t worry, they&#39;re sharp!&quot; I then assure them he understands<br/>
that knives are a TOOL to be used and respected, much like fire.<br/>
Never underestimate the value of &quot;Your concern is appreciated, your approval<br/>
is unnecessary&quot; :::vbg:::<br/>
Showing knives to others is a tough one... I&#39;ve found most parents don&#39;t<br/>
want my kid to share his passions, as they don&#39;t want to deal with the same<br/>
passion in their own kid (and they&#39;re probably tired of hearing, But Hayden<br/>
has it! :lol:) I&#39;m fully present with him and a knife, if we&#39;re outside of<br/>
our home with other kids (i.e. park day) and we&#39;re careful not to bring the<br/>
intimidating knives out and about. At home (and with specific friends), he<br/>
has much more autonomy. I keep us stocked in Ivory Soap and soft woods for<br/>
carving; I wander the space once he&#39;s fallen asleep and close the knives<br/>
that are left open and put them somewhere safe for him to find later. (we<br/>
don&#39;t have wee ones to worry about).<br/>

ANYTHING with a dull knife! If a blade is sharp, very little pressure is<br/>
used to make a cut; with a dull knife, intense pressure must be used,<br/>
leaving far too high a chance of slippage (and stabbage) -- and worse, if he<br/>
becomes used to dull knives he REALLY will hurt himself on the sharp ones as<br/>
he is unused to a gentle slice.<br/>
You can get a stone and some oil, so he understands the mechanics of knife<br/>
care and the benefits.<br/>

unschooled) tore through some crazy brush while they were camping for a few<br/>
solid days.  Then the thrill of using it was over. Now he takes it out to<br/>
reenact some of that for H :) He probably has it with him, while his family<br/>
is on the road... I hope he finds some cool weeds to chop!<br/>
Hayden&#39;s got quite the pocket knife collection. Some he&#39;s purchased at<br/>
little flea markets (I had to make the transaction...), some from the<br/>
sports/hunting store, some have been gifts. His first was a gift of an<br/>
antique mother-of-pearl pocket knife. He held it like the Holy Grail, he was<br/>
so honored by it! It was super sharp so he had some healthy fear of a<br/>
knife&#39;s purpose. His favorites are the Swiss Army knives with all their<br/>
doo-dads :) Their blades stay pretty sharp. He&#39;s even got one with a 256k<br/>
memory stick! He&#39;s been terribly sad when he&#39;s purchased cheap knives that<br/>
fall apart or are tough to lock/unlock. It&#39;s frustrating that he can&#39;t<br/>
always inspect the knives (because of the age 18 laws around here) before<br/>
making a purchase. He bought a big shiny spiky knife at our local Ren Fest--<br/>
Dull, Dull, Dull! He&#39;s now excited to find his stone so he can sharpen it<br/>
properly :)<br/>
He may also be interested in wood chopping, a good axe might be fun, if<br/>
you&#39;ve got means to have a fire - or if you know someone who does.  Hayden&#39;s<br/>
been begging to chop wood and I&#39;ve been looking for an opportunity for him<br/>
to do that (It&#39;s a whole different activity if your parents don&#39;t use it for<br/>
punishment!). We&#39;ll be going to visit my boyfriend&#39;s family at the end of<br/>
the month - Scotty&#39;s dad is VERY excited to have Hayden&#39;s help with the wood<br/>
chopping and fire starting! They spoke of it for a long time when they met.<br/>

Our 12 year old son did a scything course and we bought him a beautiful<br/>
Austrian scythe which is his pride and joy. He cuts grass for our horses and<br/>
he is always polishing or peening or sharpening his blade. He can tell you<br/>
all the reasons why scything is good for body and soul, and also why the<br/>
Austrian scythe is better than other scythes too.. with huge enthusiasm.<br/>
<br/>
Has he cut himself yet? Yes! Ended up at A&E for a few hours to get his<br/>
thumb fixed up. He can explain in detail what went wrong and what he did and<br/>
how it won&#39;t happen again. Part of the learning..<br/>

Thanks, Marcia. This is exactly what we&#39;ve been doing (except the not worrying about what others think bit. I need to work on that!) and what we&#39;ve always done. I guess I got abit thrown when others have been so poo-hooing this interest and sharing their concerns so freely with me (and Lewi).<br/>

  our home with other kids (i.e. park day) and we&#39;re careful not to bring the<br/>
  intimidating knives out and about. At home (and with specific friends), he<br/>
  has much more autonomy. I keep us stocked in Ivory Soap and soft woods for<br/>
  carving; I wander the space once he&#39;s fallen asleep and close the knives<br/>
  that are left open and put them somewhere safe for him to find later. (we<br/>
  don&#39;t have wee ones to worry about).<br/>
  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; He also desperately wants to purchase big types of knives -at the<br/>
  &gt; moment it&#39;s a machette. We&#39;ve had lots of discussion about this, and<br/>
  &gt; that will continue. I&#39;m really feeling like I need to say no to alot<br/>
  &gt; of these sorts of things though because of his age. We&#39;ve been into<br/>
  &gt; the King Of Knives store (while we were in Sydney) and he found a<br/>
  &gt; sword letter opener that he wants to buy. This would be safe as it&#39;s<br/>
  &gt; not really sharp.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I have to say: Dull knives are DANGEROUS!!! Please don&#39;t let your kid cut<br/>
  ANYTHING with a dull knife! If a blade is sharp, very little pressure is<br/>
  used to make a cut; with a dull knife, intense pressure must be used,<br/>
  leaving far too high a chance of slippage (and stabbage) -- and worse, if he<br/>
  becomes used to dull knives he REALLY will hurt himself on the sharp ones as<br/>
  he is unused to a gentle slice.<br/>
  You can get a stone and some oil, so he understands the mechanics of knife<br/>
  care and the benefits.<br/>
  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; We&#39;re talking about getting a small pocket knife as<br/>
  &gt; well. My dad has found him an antique scythe that he&#39;s going to hang<br/>
  &gt; up on his wall in his room and we&#39;ve been to Allens and got a nice<br/>
  &gt; new knife set for the kitchen which includes a meat cleaver<br/>
  &gt; (something he&#39;s loved for awhile now). I&#39;m feeling like I&#39;m doing as<br/>
  &gt; much as I can to help him get what he needs but the machette etc<br/>
  &gt; feels like it&#39;s way too much at the moment. He&#39;s very upset about my<br/>
  &gt; decision and my saying no to it. I guess I just needed to hear what<br/>
  &gt; some of your thoughts are on this and whether I could handle this in<br/>
  &gt; a much better way.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Hayden&#39;s best friend got a Machete -- Very Exciting!! I think Saylor (also<br/>
  unschooled) tore through some crazy brush while they were camping for a few<br/>
  solid days. Then the thrill of using it was over. Now he takes it out to<br/>
  reenact some of that for H :) He probably has it with him, while his family<br/>
  is on the road... I hope he finds some cool weeds to chop!<br/>
  Hayden&#39;s got quite the pocket knife collection. Some he&#39;s purchased at<br/>
  little flea markets (I had to make the transaction...), some from the<br/>
  sports/hunting store, some have been gifts. His first was a gift of an<br/>
  antique mother-of-pearl pocket knife. He held it like the Holy Grail, he was<br/>
  so honored by it! It was super sharp so he had some healthy fear of a<br/>
  knife&#39;s purpose. His favorites are the Swiss Army knives with all their<br/>
  doo-dads :) Their blades stay pretty sharp. He&#39;s even got one with a 256k<br/>
  memory stick! He&#39;s been terribly sad when he&#39;s purchased cheap knives that<br/>
  fall apart or are tough to lock/unlock. It&#39;s frustrating that he can&#39;t<br/>
  always inspect the knives (because of the age 18 laws around here) before<br/>
  making a purchase. He bought a big shiny spiky knife at our local Ren Fest--<br/>
  Dull, Dull, Dull! He&#39;s now excited to find his stone so he can sharpen it<br/>
  properly :)<br/>
  He may also be interested in wood chopping, a good axe might be fun, if<br/>
  you&#39;ve got means to have a fire - or if you know someone who does. Hayden&#39;s<br/>
  been begging to chop wood and I&#39;ve been looking for an opportunity for him<br/>
  to do that (It&#39;s a whole different activity if your parents don&#39;t use it for<br/>
  punishment!). We&#39;ll be going to visit my boyfriend&#39;s family at the end of<br/>
  the month - Scotty&#39;s dad is VERY excited to have Hayden&#39;s help with the wood<br/>
  chopping and fire starting! They spoke of it for a long time when they met.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1855489535">Cathy, thanks for sharing about your son&#39;s interest in scythe&#39;s. Lewi is getting one from my dad soon. It&#39;s an antique to be hung in his room but maybe we can look for a newer, sharp one for him to use. For some reason I feel like his coordination, at the moment, would be better suited to a scythe with a long handle over a machette. The idea of learning to sharpen it himself would really enthuse him. He&#39;s been trying to sharpen old bones and paint scrapers with our kitchen stone for awhile now so I know he&#39;d love to learn to do that properly and on something that&#39;s meant to be sharp.<br/>

  &gt;Do you have brush that needs cutting down? My girls (I know the youngest<br/>
  was 7, the older would have been about 9 at the time) Really enjoyed cutting<br/>
  brush with a machete when we were cleaning up our yard. &lt;<br/>
<br/>
  Our 12 year old son did a scything course and we bought him a beautiful<br/>
  Austrian scythe which is his pride and joy. He cuts grass for our horses and<br/>
  he is always polishing or peening or sharpening his blade. He can tell you<br/>
  all the reasons why scything is good for body and soul, and also why the<br/>
  Austrian scythe is better than other scythes too.. with huge enthusiasm.<br/>
<br/>
  Has he cut himself yet? Yes! Ended up at A&E for a few hours to get his<br/>
  thumb fixed up. He can explain in detail what went wrong and what he did and<br/>
  how it won&#39;t happen again. Part of the learning..<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1852199781">Considering he was in school from age 3 to 8.5 before we pulled him mid third grade 4 years ago.  We never schooled at home - went straight from Public Montessori to radical unschooling.  It was a natural - he has always been radically unschooled at home anyway.  We just didn&#39;t call it that; we were simply learning through living life since birth.  In fact we were unschooling for a bit after pulling him from school before we learned there were homeschool groups calling it unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Dad is the stay at home person but we all are living life together and learning together.<br/>
<br/>
He is so proud of his unschooling - it always brings a smile to my face.  When people ask him what grade he is in, he responds he is homeschooled.  Then they say, yes but what grade.  He answers &quot;I could be any grade I want, I could be in 12th grade if I wanted.&quot;  (he says it with such pride)  Or if people ask specific questions he will say, we don&#39;t do math or such and such subject, I do what ever I want every day, we&#39;re unschoolers.  We get a lot of frowns that way - even from relatives.  LOL  My sister didn&#39;t even believe him - she just said, oh Zac quit being so silly.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re not perfect - I joined this list about a month ago to challenge my (our) thinking a bit more as our son is turning 13 next month and there is no active radical unschool group near us - the ones that say they unschool are not really in our opinion as they have certain requirements such as reading everyday for &quot;X&quot; number of minutes.<br/>
<br/>
I do have a few questions that are bouncing around in my head but am not sure I&#39;m ready to release them yet - will probably read for a while longer  ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-556619017">Hi Kim<br/>
<br/>
With regard to scything, do investigate courses in your area. In the UK<br/>
there is also at least one annual scything competition - the one we are<br/>
going to takes place next week.<br/>
<br/>
Jon (my 12 year old son) is adamant that doing a course makes all the<br/>
difference between success and failure. He says that one will quickly become<br/>
discouraged because it is hard work if not done correctly. (Apparently it is<br/>
not hard at all if done correctly!!!). When he did his course there was - in<br/>
addition to the course leader - an old man of about 80 who was hard to<br/>
understand as he only had 2 teeth(!) but who shared a wealth of information<br/>
about the art of scything - amazing to think that he was scything in the<br/>
days when that was the only way to harvest hay!!! Jon couldn&#39;t stop talking<br/>
about him. <br/>
<br/>
Apparently British and American scythes are heavy and unwieldy to use<br/>
compared to the Austrian ones. Secondly, it is very important that the<br/>
scythe is measured correctly to fit the handler, otherwise sore muscles are<br/>
inevitable. Finally, knowing at what angle to set the blade is important to<br/>
make the job easier. And one sharpens the blade briefly every 5 minutes or<br/>
so while using it. You carry a little jar (fits onto your belt) filled with<br/>
water, and your whetstone goes in it, and periodically you get it out and<br/>
sharpen the blade, and then you continue. There are different whetstones and<br/>
the sharpening of the blade is an art all of its own. At the end of the<br/>
session you do a proper sharpening so that the blade is ready for next time.<br/>
To me (as an observer) the whole procedure is very finicky - you spend so<br/>
much time fiddling and sharpening, but my son assures me that it is because<br/>
he is still learning - apparently it gets quicker and quicker to sharpen the<br/>
blade as time goes on (the afore mentioned old man sharpened and scythed so<br/>
fast that the others couldn&#39;t even begin to keep up with him). <br/>
<br/>
What I love seeing the most in my son is the passion and enthusiasm. He is<br/>
loving what he is doing, and I think the very fact that it is finicky, and<br/>
not something that everyone can &#39;just do&#39; gives him a kick. And he is sooo<br/>
proud of his blade - I have to inspect it regularly - he delights in showing<br/>
me how he repaired a nick or how he sharpened at this angle or that angle<br/>
for different purposes, and I peer closely but can&#39;t really see what he<br/>
means, but that is ok too, because he feels quite pleased that he is the one<br/>
in the know.. And our paddocks are getting cut steadily, bit by bit.. He<br/>
comes inside tired and hot and sweaty, but with a huge grin on his face and<br/>
a very peaceful inner self. It looks a lot like he has found a long term<br/>
hobby.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, it seems that children need to be 8 to start learning the art of<br/>
scything. Anyway, have a look at this website:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.scytheconnection.com/index.html.">http://www.scytheconnection.com/index.html.</a> There is also a short video<br/>
showing scything on the website. Click on &#39;Events&#39; for contact details for<br/>
scything in the USA (I am assuming that this is where you are???)<br/>
<br/>
