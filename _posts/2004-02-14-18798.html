<div id="ygrps-yiv-2009037663">He&#39;d have been 10 years old today.  Double digits.  He&#39;d think that <br/>
was cool.<br/>
When the kids got up this morning, they had presents on the table <br/>
from Sam, wrapped in birthday paper.  He&#39;d have thought that was cool <br/>
too.  They sure did.  <br/>
I walked into Wal Mart yesterday and said, &quot;Okay Sammy, show me what <br/>
you&#39;d get them.&quot;  <br/>
We found a cool Sponge Bob skateboard for Carly, a Razor scooter for <br/>
Jack and a Disney princess scooter for Jamie.  I hadn&#39;t planned on <br/>
it.   The skateboard was something I knew Carly would want.  She gets <br/>
a little upset when Jack and Jamie use Sams.  Now they can use hers <br/>
instead.  The scooters totally jumped out at me.  They have been <br/>
riding inside and outside all day.  <br/>
Bob went to get Sam&#39;s name and dates put under his portrait tatoo on <br/>
his arm.  I haven&#39;t seen it yet.  He&#39;s heading home now.<br/>
Some of my family are coming over tonight for his birthday dinner and <br/>
getting the house straightend, cooking and baking a cake, is keeping <br/>
me busy. <br/>
I hope everyone is having a nice Valentines day.  <br/>
Just wanted to share a little of Sam with you guys.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-73080485">Hi, Joanna!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for this message.  I want you to know that I&#39;ve been thinking about <br/>
Sam, but I didn&#39;t know that this was his birthday.<br/>
<br/>
Liam (who&#39;s 9 now) asked me to make up a story the other morning when we <br/>
woke up at about 4 a.m.  We were lying in bed talking and not wanting to <br/>
turn on the light and read, so Liam asked me to make up a story.  I asked <br/>
him what he&#39;d like the story to be about and he said &quot;protest.&quot;  To make my <br/>
very long story not quite as long, I made up a story about a guy named <br/>
&quot;Joe&quot; who had lost his connection with his spirit when he was a little kid <br/>
because he had been driven real hard his whole life by his family and <br/>
teachers and that kind of thing.  Joe ends up being president of the US, <br/>
but all the things he does while in office are pretty mean and awful and he <br/>
gets the country into a war and a big financial mess and all <br/>
that.  Meanwhile, there are lots of protests going on all the time outside <br/>
the White House because so many people in the country are so unhappy with Joe.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, there&#39;s this one little 9-year-old boy who&#39;s with his folks at one <br/>
of the protests.  He wanders away to find a place to relieve himself and <br/>
somehow gets himself inside the White House (it couldn&#39;t happen, I know, <br/>
but it&#39;s a story!).  He gets real scared when he can&#39;t find his way back <br/>
out and hides in a bathroom.  Turns out the prez has to relieve himself at <br/>
about that time, and finds this little boy hiding in the bathroom.<br/>
<br/>
At this point, Liam asked me the boy&#39;s name.  I thought a little bit, and I <br/>
figured Sam would be a good name.<br/>
<br/>
Well, in the story, Joe and Sam meet at an opportune time for Joe, because <br/>
he sees himself in Sam and realizes that he had once had a connection to <br/>
his spirit the way Joe does now.  So, Sam and Joe talk for a while.  Joe <br/>
wants to know what moved Sam and his folks to come to Washington and <br/>
protest.  Sam, in his eloquent, 9-year-old way, tells the prez what&#39;s been <br/>
eating him about the state of the union.  And, in a rare moment of empathy <br/>
and compassion, Joe sees all that has been going on through a boy&#39;s <br/>
perspective.<br/>
<br/>
And, Joe changes and things get much better.  It&#39;s a magic story.<br/>
<br/>
Afterwards, I told Liam who Sam is.  It was wonderful to have Sam with us <br/>
in the story for just a little bit.  Anyway, thanks for sharing Sam with <br/>
us, and Happy Birthday to Sam!<br/>

  this was sooo touching...thank you for sharing it with us.  I know you don&#39;t know me, but I know Sam&#39;s story and he was actually on my mind just a few days ago.  What a surprise to learn that his birthday was so close.<br/>
<br/>
  Happy Birthday Sam!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1527934780">I know nothing of who Sam is other than a beloved family member of <br/>
yours.  I&#39;d like to say Happy Birthday as well.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d also like to thank you.  I have a daughter that would&#39;ve been 12 <br/>
this year.  I have often wondered how our family could observe her <br/>
memory w/out it being a sad thing. What you do is a beautiful way to <br/>
celebrate her life.<br/>

When I joined this group I had no idea all the ways I&#39;d actually be <br/>
getting support.  Just goes to show everything really does happen <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1051374758">Hi Joanna...I just read this...thanks for sharing with us about Sam. I<br/>
didn&#39;t know that he was a Valentine&#39;s baby. It was great to actually<br/>
meet you and your family this summer down at the beach and sad too that<br/>
we were not able to meet Sam as well. <br/>
<br/>
Take care...<br/>
