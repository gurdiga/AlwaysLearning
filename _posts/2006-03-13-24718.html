<div id="ygrps-yiv-726274191">***The Greenland Whale Fisheries survives because it has a really great  <br/>
tune, but it preserves a date very badly. &lt;g&gt;  &quot;It was in eighteen  <br/>
hundred and fifty five (or three or something) and on June the  <br/>
fourteenth day (or someteenth day)...&quot;   All that needs to rhyme is  <br/>
&quot;day&quot; with &quot;sailed away.&quot;***<br/>
<br/>
I know this song!  <br/>
<br/>
My Aunt Eula used to sing a version of it to me but I don&#39;t remember all<br/>
the words.<br/>
<br/>
Was in eighteen hundred and fifty three<br/>
On June the thirteenth day<br/>
That our gallant ship <br/>
Her anchors weighed <br/>
And for Greenland sailed away, brave boys<br/>
For Greenland sailed away<br/>
<br/>
(Something missing here) <br/>
<br/>
The lookout in the crosstrees stood<br/>
With spyglass in his hand<br/>
There&#39;s a whale, there&#39;s a whale,<br/>
there&#39;s whalefish he cried<br/>
And she blows at every span, brave boys<br/>
She blows at every span.<br/>
<br/>
(Something here I don&#39;t remember)<br/>
<br/>
Now we struck that whale and the line paid out,<br/>
But the whale made a flounder with her tail,<br/>
And the boat capsized and four men were drowned,<br/>
And we never caught that whale, brave boys,<br/>
And we never caught that whale.<br/>
<br/>
To lose that whale, our captain cried,<br/>
It grieves my heart full sore,<br/>
But to lose four of my gallant men<br/>
It grieves me ten times more, brave boys<br/>
It grieves me ten times more.<br/>
<br/>
(Something here I&#39;ve forgotten) <br/>
<br/>
Now Greenland is a dreadful place<br/>
It&#39;s a land that never is green<br/>
Where there&#39;s ice and snow, and the whalefishes blow<br/>
and the daylight&#39;s seldom seen, brave boys<br/>
And the daylight&#39;s seldom seen.<br/>
<br/>
I have looked for this song, the way my auntie used to sing it but never<br/>
found her version of it and never liked the other versions well enough to<br/>
remember them. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
And I think it was July something when the Electra fell in the ocean far<br/>
away. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

to lose those men (however many of them) it grieved his heart full  <br/>
sore, but oh, to lose that 40 barrel (or however many barrels) whale,  <br/>
it grieves me ten times more.<br/>
<br/>
He wasn&#39;t as nice a captain. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea how many men and how many barrels, but partly that&#39;s  <br/>
my number-memory disability.  I just can&#39;t remember numbers very well  <br/>
unless they make visual patterns in my head, and few do.<br/>
