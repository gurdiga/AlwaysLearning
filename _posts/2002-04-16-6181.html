&gt;it becomes appropriate for our family to get something, we try to....NOT bec. <br/>
&gt;we are trying to teach something but bec. ds wants to use a microscope just <br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My mother ordered something by mail and ended up with &quot;2 free gifts&quot;. <br/>
 One was a box of plastic dress-up shoes and a tiara.  The other was a <br/>
cheap plastic microscope and lots of accessories that nonetheless ended <br/>
up working just fine.  She gave the microscope to Will and the dress-ups <br/>
to me to pass along to a toddler I know.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t remember any time in school that I ever peered into a microscope <br/>
in class.  I don&#39;t remember ever using the bunsen burners or anything <br/>
else like &quot;lab equipment&quot;.  I opted out of biology and the other science <br/>
classes in high school.  We look in those wide-lensed microscopes all <br/>
the time at museums, at pre-selected specimens, though.  I&#39;ve never <br/>
thought it necessary to actually buy a good microscope like some <br/>
homeschoolers.  <br/>
<br/>
But....that little cheapo 300x/600/1200x microscope that was free with a <br/>
mail order has been one of the most interesting things Will has come <br/>
across in a long time.  He spent an entire day running in and out of the <br/>
house and putting things he&#39;d found on slides to view them.  I never <br/>
gave him any input on how to use it, except to put the batteries in.  He <br/>
figured out all on his own, without reading directions since he&#39;s on a <br/>
bit of a reading strike these days, how to put the specimen on the slide <br/>
and that a drop of water helps and the thinner the specimen the better.  <br/>
<br/>
I like having lots of books and paper and stuff.  I can&#39;t throw anything <br/>
away, really.  The motto of the packrat is &quot;you never know when <br/>
something is going to come in handy&quot;.  ;)<br/>

What a great story!  How appropriate that that microscope end up in <br/>
Will&#39;s hands!  <br/>
<br/>
Could it be that that microscope will be a starting point for Will <br/>
whereas it would sit on a shelf in another home?  Could it be that it <br/>
came to Will in a way other than coincidence?  <br/>
<br/>
If I had had an opportunity for a microscope, I probably would have <br/>
taken it too....I wonder what opportunities I&#39;ve rejected, tho, bec. <br/>
of feeling overwhelmed by the amount of stuffs in our house <br/>
already....???  I wonder what kids in my community would be inspired <br/>
by the Brio train set that sits unused here....?  perhaps the whole <br/>
universe needs to do a shuffling of stuffs so they get into the right <br/>
hands!  So that I am open for our &#39;microscope&#39; and others get their <br/>
object for inspiration.....Who knows?!<br/>

YES! Same here. Not doing is definitely on our list of &quot;things to do&quot;....my <br/>
ds laid on the floor of his room for about an hour yesterday, seemingly <br/>

dabble with it.<br/>

workbooks....does not mean I ever make my kids use them. <br/>
I feel it is another part of the world I have given them access to by having <br/>
these things available. They are no less or more important than other things <br/>

books around, doesn&#39;t mean the others feel the same way.<br/>
I would be careful to not glean entirely too many opportunities out the door!!<br/>
I think an unschooling household should be a haven for exploration. Books, <br/>
weird items, animal parts etc.....(again, just my opinion here).<br/>
We have a very small house but manage to have some interesting bins including <br/>
mukluks, skulls, shells, nests and other nature related items, crafty items <br/>
in another like bottled ink, dye, plaster and buttons ( not to mention the <br/>
collection of bins that have pens, paint, crayons etc....) We have bins with <br/>
math manipulatives and games, some with alphabet manipulatives, cookie <br/>
cutters ( an amazing collection), drawing tools............I could go on, the <br/>
point is, I&#39;d never get rid of something just because it is intended as <br/>
&quot;educational&quot; material.<br/>
I don&#39;t necessarily think it&#39;s any more educational than other materials we <br/>
have around, but they are all valid objects to dabble with and use.<br/>
I volunteer to relieve anyone of their materials or books...just send them <br/>
this way!!!  I won&#39;t even charge for this service. LOL<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; The trick here is to show him that learning<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t have to come from schoolbooks (in fact,<br/>
&gt; the best learning comes from anything *but*<br/>
&gt; schoolbooks).  Keep a learning log for a while,<br/>
&gt; and show it to him when he asks.  Jot down<br/>
&gt; discussions, observations, questions asked and<br/>
&gt; answered, explanations given, projects and<br/>
&gt; experiments, nature walks, anything you can<br/>
&gt; think of during the day that demonstrates<br/>
&gt; learning.  It will amaze you, and hopefully<br/>
&gt; convince him.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have done that, and he is impressed, but then he comes back with<br/>
statements like, &quot;They need to learn their math.&quot; &quot;What about algebra?&quot;<br/>
&quot;What about history?&quot; etc. And right now, we are getting ready to move, so<br/>
we are not going on nature walks, or working on projects, and he keeps<br/>
saying that the kids need to do their school work everyday. If I am busy,<br/>
the kids only want to watch TV or play video games. If my time is freed up,<br/>
they love to do projects, read with me, go places, have discussions, etc. My<br/>
husband&#39;s pestering about the neccessity of &quot;school work&quot; on &quot;school days&quot;<br/>
has gotten to the point that my youngest son, age 11, will absolutely refuse<br/>
to do anything remotely &quot;educational&quot; if it is not a school day for the<br/>
public school kids. Whereas he didn&#39;t used to care what day it was, if he<br/>
was curious about something he would ask me to help him look it up, find<br/>
more info at the library, or do a project with him. But now when he asks me<br/>
something on a non-&quot;school&quot; day, and I say something like, &quot;lets go look it<br/>
up&quot;, he will say, &quot;no way! Today isn&#39;t a school day!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; My husband was against homeschooling at first,<br/>
&gt; but agreed to let me try it for summer school.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My husband wasn&#39;t against starting homeschool. Weve been doing it for about<br/>
2 years now for my two youngest son&#39;s ages 11 and 13 1/2. He just thinks we<br/>
need to do &quot;school&quot; type learning every &quot;school day&quot;.  I have had a problem<br/>
with his attitude that they only need to learn on school days, and can only<br/>
learn by doing &quot;school stuff&quot;, even before I started leaning towards<br/>
unschooling. I have had the kids do &quot;school&quot; at home, but if they just<br/>
weren&#39;t in the mood, or if I didn&#39;t have time to watch over them to make<br/>
sure they did it, I wouldn&#39;t push it. But I know that they learned things on<br/>
those days. But my husband would get upset and say that they were going to<br/>
fall to far behind, and maybe we should put them back in public school<br/>
because they weren&#39;t accomplishing enough at home.  My mother-in-law says<br/>
that I have failed at &quot;schooling&quot; the boys, and it will be to there<br/>
&quot;ruination&quot;. Unfortunately, she has a lot of influence on my husband.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;We started with school at home, but<br/>
&gt; gradually went more and more toward unschooling<br/>
&gt; as I read John Holt&#39;s works and met other<br/>
&gt; unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess I need to get some of Holt&#39;s books. But how did you convince your dh<br/>
that unschooling was the way to go? He thinks that if they are not<br/>
intentionally being taught specific things, that they are not getting an<br/>
education. I doubt that I could get my husband to read any books. I have<br/>
tried before; he will start them but he doesn&#39;t usually get far. He doesn&#39;t<br/>
like to read. He still has yet to make it all the way through an algebra<br/>
course. He says that the reason he wants me to do &quot;school&quot; schooling with<br/>
them is because he doesn&#39;t want them to wind up like him.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;My son is now 18 and finishing<br/>
&gt; his sophomore year of college, and my 17-year-<br/>
&gt; old daughter is studying for the CHSPE,<br/>
&gt; volunteering at the local library, and drawing<br/>
&gt; incessantly.  I see them as proof that<br/>
&gt; unschooling works.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Debbie<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wish I could have a crystal ball so that I could show my husband that the<br/>
kids are not going to be ruined if they don&#39;t do work out of a math book<br/>
everyday. And that they could be doing things like your kids are now. (By<br/>
the way, what is the CHSPE?)<br/>

you are, and tell your husband you will be doing more learning stuff<br/>
during the summer months.<br/>
<br/>
This doesn&#39;t really address his skepticism about unschooling, but it<br/>
buys you time, and it&#39;s probably true.<br/>

<br/>
He&#39;s right.<br/>
<br/>
This is not just a matter of language, but of perception and CONception.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Education&quot; is what one person does to another.  It&#39;s a trasitive verb--the <br/>
subject educates the object.<br/>
<br/>
If you change the language you use to discuss your children&#39;s learning at <br/>
home, it will gradually change the way you both see what you are doing.  <br/>
<br/>
As long as you, too, use the word &quot;education&quot; your husband will be right.<br/>
<br/>
So instead of trying to show him how they can get an education without being <br/>
taught (which they technically cannot), discuss how unschooled teens have <br/>
learned all the elements that &#39;educated&#39; children learn, plus many more, in <br/>
natural, non-threatening ways that never seem like &quot;school work&quot; because they <br/>
aren&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
The closest you&#39;ll get to a crystal ball is his meeting other unschooling <br/>
families, and maybe talking to some really confident dads.  The best <br/>
opportunity for that might be a conference where unschoolers are.  But if <br/>
there are some local families, maybe you could host a barbecue or something <br/>
to get some families in one place.<br/>

Proficiency Exam.  A passing score on this test <br/>
is equivalent to a high school diploma.  While <br/>
I don&#39;t necessarily agree with the test, it <br/>

<br/>
I didn&#39;t have to convince my husband that <br/>
unschooling was the right way.  We got into it <br/>
very gradually, and he could see that the kids <br/>
were learning a lot.  He never asked to see <br/>
their schoolwork, but he would ask them what <br/>
they did in school, at least at first.  After a <br/>
while, that changed to &quot;What did you do today?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think you should have a heart-to-heart talk <br/>
with your husband.  Ask him what his concerns <br/>
are, and try to be understanding, even if you <br/>
disagree.  Make sure he knows that you want <br/>
your children to grow up believing that <br/>
learning is a natural part of life, and not <br/>
just something you do in school.  As far as the <br/>
algebra and history are concerned, they&#39;ll <br/>
learn it if they need to.  I took history in <br/>
school, and got good grades in it, but never <br/>
really learned it.  My daughter resisted math <br/>
for years, but when she found out how much she <br/>
needs to know for the CHSPE she started <br/>
studying it in earnest.  If children are <br/>
encouraged to explore their interests, they&#39;ll <br/>
learn things you could never teach them if you <br/>
tried.  I woke up one morning about 8 years ago <br/>
to find my kids poring over the encyclopedias, <br/>
studying and writing down all the old alphabets <br/>
they could find.  I imagine that if I had made <br/>
that an assignment it would have been met with <br/>
great resistance. <br/>

I still need your help with unschooling.  My kids seem so focused on<br/>
playing the computer.  They are addicted to &quot;The Sims&quot;.  It is a very<br/>
mentally stimulating game but prevents exposure to other things.  It<br/>
seems like as soon as I am done introducing them to something, they<br/>
go back to playing on the computer.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve told them I thought it was a better idea to balance their use of<br/>

Each time they do this, they find a good site that introduces them to<br/>
something new.  The problem is I have to always prod and poke them a<br/>
little to move in this direction.  Is this what unschooling should be?<br/>
<br/>
-------------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The  more you try to pull them from something they are really interested and<br/>
engaged in, the stronger they will resist (at least I hope so -- in my<br/>
opinion, it shows a lack of pluck for any red-blooded child to meekly follow<br/>
everything Mom thinks is more important).<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling in our house is assuredly not one family member &quot;poking&quot; others,<br/>
in the direction that family member thinks they &quot;should&quot; go.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter received as a gift from her grandmother an old Nintendo game for<br/>
our old Nintendo system called &quot;Kirby&#39;s Great Adventure&quot; (or something very<br/>
close to that). She spent the first three days leaving Kirby only to eat and<br/>
sleep (I do believe she used the bathroom in there somewhere, too). My<br/>
typical travel-loving child had no interest in accompanying me on my<br/>
errands, though I did offer (with the expectation of being refused).<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s on, I think she said level 7 (my husband could tell you for sure, he<br/>
and Brit have always bonded over video games &lt;g&gt;) and her game use has<br/>
whittled down to perhaps 25% or a bit less of her waking hours.<br/>
<br/>
As far as I know, Kirby&#39;s Great Adventure has no educational use whatsoever.<br/>
&lt;g&gt; Sandra could probably tell me where I&#39;m going wrong on that assumption.<br/>
;) But I don&#39;t care. The game is not the total of her life of learning. It&#39;s<br/>
not probable that Brit will spend her life at it and end up drooling into<br/>
her pancakes each morning.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about offering, not poking, not badgering, not begging, IMHO.<br/>
Let them know what you&#39;re going to be doing, let them know of things coming<br/>
up that you believe might interest them. When you can squeeze in on the<br/>
computer, do a web search and see if there are similar games to the one<br/>
they&#39;re enjoying so you can facilitate their interest (we just bought on<br/>
eBay an old NES cartridge called &quot;Rainbow&quot; something that looks like a<br/>
Kirby&#39;s Great Adventure-style game for Brit, and if it is we&#39;ll no doubt<br/>
lose her to the NES for another solid week or two).<br/>

go back to playing on the computer. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They won&#39;t play it forever.<br/>
It&#39;s not just mentally stimulating, they&#39;re learning all kinds of real <br/>
things.  Have you played it, or sat next to them and watched them play?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;ve told them I thought it was a better idea to balance their use of <br/>
the computer to looking for other interesting things on it as well.  <br/>
Each time they do this, they find a good site that introduces them to <br/>
something new.  The problem is I have to always prod and poke them a <br/>
little to move in this direction.  Is this what unschooling should be?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not the poking and prodding part.  <br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t need to tell what it is, but you said you have stuff going on that <br/>
has kept you from playing with the new Christmas microscope for three months. <br/>
 First, I don&#39;t think the microscope will go bad for sitting!  BUT what if <br/>
someone was poking and prodding you to balance your time between what it is <br/>
you&#39;re needing or wanting to do, and playing with that microscope a little <br/>
bit every day?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it would make you like the microscope OR that pokey-proddy <br/>
person much.<br/>
<br/>
If Sims is what they like about the computer, to come and suggest they&#39;re not <br/>
using the computer well or right seems off topic for them.  If you let them <br/>
play whatever they want to, I&#39;m pretty sure they&#39;ll move on to other things <br/>
on their own.<br/>
<br/>
We have had for years  a shareware hangman game I paid $10 or so for, and the <br/>
other day Marty said it was asking for the password.  I told him where it <br/>
was, and he restored it.  I had no idea Marty was playing hangman sometimes <br/>
on his own.  If he hadn&#39;t needed the password, he probably wouldn&#39;t have <br/>
mentioned it.  It wasn&#39;t important.  <br/>
<br/>
I know Holly plays it because sometimes she&#39;ll show me what she has and ask <br/>
for suggestions, and I&#39;ll say &quot;probably a vowel&quot; or &quot;c&quot; might be part of a <br/>
blend--try &quot;h&quot; or &quot;k.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
There are thirty or so OTHER games on that computer.  And Marty usually plays <br/>
Civilization on it.  <br/>
<br/>
Holly still plays a really ancient game on the old Macintosh called &quot;Blobbo,&quot; <br/>
and she knows ALL about the levels she can do.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Should I just continue offering and not worry?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think so.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Are my kids deschooling or is this a phase that a lot of kids go <br/>
through?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Both?<br/>
<br/>
Do they ever go out with you in the yard to see the progress?  Holly and I go <br/>
out together and see what&#39;s sprouted and blooming.  I do most of the work, <br/>
but if she helps me I let her quit when she wants to.  Yesterday she and I <br/>
dug up dandelions together.  She got tired and I finished on my own.  Instead <br/>
of resenting that she quit, I was glad she had helped.  From my point of <br/>
view, it was a learning an togetherness opportunity, not a chore.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re growing pumpkins.  The plants are about four inches tall, and sometimes <br/>
I water then and sometimes she does.  There&#39;s not a schedule.  <br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have a microscope.  We do have a paper cup with things we want to <br/>
look at under the microscopes when we go to the science museum. They have <br/>
some GREAT little microscopes you can switch the lighting from top to bottom, <br/>
so you can look through things like slides or insect wings, or with top <br/>
lighting you can look far down into rocks, leaves, pennies, the tiny cuts <br/>
around your cuticles.  you can look at a credit card and see way down into <br/>
the holograms! And the edges of the raised numbers and letters aren&#39;t as <br/>
smooth close up as they are in &quot;real size.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If we had a little home microscope, it probably couldn&#39;t do all that.  <br/>
<br/>
Still, I wouldn&#39;t turn one down! &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
I saw one at a CompUSA that hooks to a PC, so you see whatever it is on the <br/>
monitor!  It was $99, but I have a Mac. &lt;g&gt;  Kirby just bought himself a <br/>
PC...  hmmmmm....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1516218876">Have you tried the suggestion of just *pretending* they are on summer vacation?<br/>
I believe your kids used to be in school, right?<br/>
When they were on summer vacation, would you poke and prod them or would you let them do pretty much whatever they wanted to do? Afterall, they had been working SO HARD all year long in school, they deserved a break during summer, right?<br/>
<br/>
When I remember my own summer vacations (many, many years ago), it was day after day of doing whatever I wanted to do basically. We were allowed to eat cinnamon toast for breakfast while watching our favorite cartoons, play games with each other (my sisters and I), go to the library and read lots of books, watch more TV, lots and lots of &quot;playing&quot;, going out on occasion, and I&#39;m sure if we had a computer back then, we could have been playing on it. My parents didn&#39;t have many expectations of us kids while we were on summer vacation. From what I can remember, there was a nice, regular rhythm to the day. Okay, sometimes it did get BORING! :-) <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this is what it&#39;s like at our house many days. I don&#39;t expect my kids to &quot;do&quot; anything. It is summer vacation ALL THE TIME. (YAY!!!) And those times when it starts getting boring is when unschooling kicks in. Then I start offering, suggesting, thinking of different things to do, places to go, people to see. It all works out wonderfully.<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion - get in the summer vacation mode and stay there!<br/>
Most importantly, HAVE FUN!!! And I would say, let them play SIMS to their hearts content. :o)<br/>

you could show them &quot;in real life&quot;.  What do they talk about when they&#39;re <br/>
playing?  That would clue you in to what other games or ideas or activities <br/>
you could offer - not to lure them away from the game but to enrich the <br/>
experience and show them something about how one thing can lead to another.<br/>

to?  Maybe *you* could look for sites and just bookmark them in a file for <br/>
the girls to look at if they get bored with their game.  Maybe there are <br/>
sites out there that would help them with Sims - hints or whatever.  You <br/>
want them to see the internet as a tool *for them* as opposed to something <br/>
you want them to do.<br/>
<br/>
Or you could just wait it out.  I&#39;ve never known my son to play the same <br/>
game intensively for all that long.<br/>

Kids in school and kids being homeschooled/unschooled are no <br/>

high school kids drift through high school and only decide to get <br/>
their acts together when they can&#39;t get into the college they want or <br/>
what ever it is they want to do and can&#39;t.  The reason they are <br/>
drifting is because learning has not been presented in an interesting <br/>

<br/>
Why would we spend the time and energy to homeschool/unschool if our <br/>
kids were going to squander this time.  I&#39;m not talking about forced <br/>
learning of any kind.  I&#39;m talking about taking *advantage* of what <br/>
unschooling has to offer.  I think our children need to understand <br/>
what wonderful opportunities they have and I don&#39;t think it is wrong <br/>
for me to discuss that with them.  The same as I would discuss with <br/>
them the value of showing appreciation for a gift they received by <br/>
sending a thank you note.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure many of you will say there is no such thing as a child <br/>
squandering his time.  As long as there are interesting things to do, <br/>
children will choose those things eventually - when they are bored.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering if this is true for children that have been in school <br/>
for 6 or 7 years like mine.  I remember reading in one of Holt&#39;s <br/>

The problem here is, who gets to define what &quot;too much&quot; of &quot;anything&quot; is?<br/>

Your too much may not be mine. Mine may not be your child&#39;s. Your child&#39;s<br/>

<br/>
Because it&#39;s THEIR learning, IMHO they should get to regulate how much is<br/>
too much. I have heard tales of children who couldn&#39;t regulate (&quot;he just<br/>

I suppose I think of &quot;poke&quot; as a negative thing. Offering is what I do.<br/>
&quot;Look, there&#39;s a parade next week, do you want to go?&quot; instead of &quot;You&#39;ve<br/>
been on that computer for four days, let&#39;s go to a parade!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re telling them (verbally or not) that what they are doing is bad,<br/>
wrong, too much, not learning, not learning enough, I think it&#39;s a problem<br/>
for unschooling. It&#39;s saying you know what&#39;s better for them to learn.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re just bringing up the same things you would bring up if the<br/>
children were spending all their time reading the collected work of Will<br/>
Shakespeare and calculating the root of pi, that&#39;s a different matter.<br/>
<br/>
**********Kids in school and kids being homeschooled/unschooled are no<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t understand this statement at all. I can&#39;t imagine anything more<br/>
different than children deciding their own path in learning (unschooling)<br/>
versus it being decided for them (schooling and some/most homeschooling).<br/>
Clarify?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
A spoonful of sugar is not what&#39;s needed to make the algebra go down. When<br/>
you say to a child, &quot;This is not valuable, choose from these valuable<br/>
activities I am giving you&quot;, that&#39;s no choice at all, IMHO.<br/>

<br/>
Who gets to define &quot;squander&quot;? Who gets to define &quot;taking advantage of what<br/>
unschooling has to offer&quot;? A child playing a computer game for four weeks<br/>
straight IS taking advantage of what unschooling has to offer (can&#39;t get<br/>
away with that in school, or in a school-at-home family), as long as they<br/>
are not playing &quot;by default&quot; because they have no other good choices. If<br/>
they have choices and someone noticing what they like or might like, without<br/>
that same someone thinking in the back of their head &quot;this will get them<br/>
away from that stupid (fill in the blank activity) and LEARNING SOMETHING&quot;,<br/>
unschooling flourishes.<br/>

He&#39;s told them that they&#39;ve been brainwashed to believe that school is a<br/>
requirement.  THEY say that I&#39;ve brainwashed HIM!  I just find it hard to<br/>
believe TEENAGERS already think this way. I expect it from parents, but the<br/>
kids?<br/>

&lt;&lt; Maybe *you* could look for sites and just bookmark them in a file for <br/>
the girls to look at if they get bored with their game. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I e-mail my kids links all the time.  Sometimes I just look for links Holly <br/>
would like, because she doesn&#39;t get much e-mail, and I&#39;m sad when she goes to <br/>
check and there&#39;s nothing.  It&#39;s probably sad too when it&#39;s all from her mom! <br/>
 But I try to find animated dancing things or sites with music and pictures <br/>
of dolls like she has, or something she&#39;s asked about lately.  Not just sites <br/>
with words, because she doesn&#39;t read well.  (But the Mac can be induced to <br/>
read to her, which helps sometimes.)<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes Holly and I just play with the computer like people play with a <br/>
book or game, looking for what might be there randomly.  We&#39;ll put two <br/>
seemingly unrelated words into google.com and see what sites we get.  And <br/>
we&#39;ve looked at people&#39;s personal photo sites of cats named Holly, dogs named <br/>
Holly, etc.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2125114456">&lt;&lt; I do not tell them what to do but I feel it is my responsibility as <br/>
their parent to help them understand that too much of anything is not <br/>
good.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Too much positive regard?  Too much love?  Too much happiness?<br/>
Too much time to think and play?<br/>
<br/>
A truism like &quot;too much of anything is not good&quot; can limit our actual <br/>
thinking.  If &quot;rules&quot; like that are more important that what our kids want, <br/>
unschooling won&#39;t kick in as it can if our thinking is set to accept that <br/>
what we &quot;knew&quot; before might not apply at all anymore.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I thought poking was ok.  I certainly poke them about their rooms and <br/>
I feel I should poke them about balance in their lives.  There are no <br/>
consequences or punishments just discussions.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
For some kids, &quot;a discussion&quot; can be a punishment, and certainly can be a <br/>
consequence! &lt;g&gt;   When I say &quot;I need to talk to you, [kidname]&quot; that&#39;s not <br/>
&quot;just a discussion.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Instead of poking them about their rooms, can you wait until they REALLY need <br/>
to clean them (company&#39;s coming, or more of their laundry is lost or under <br/>
the bed than in the hamper, or something pressing) and then just ASK them?<br/>
<br/>
(&quot;Poking&quot; to me has the connotation of little jabs, and little jabs are often <br/>
sarcasm or insult.  So  maybe you mean &quot;pressure&quot; and not &quot;poking,&quot; and this <br/>
is minor in a way, and crucial in a way.)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Kids in school and kids being homeschooled/unschooled are no <br/>
different when it comes to learning on their own terms.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Kids in school are not learning on their own terms.  They can zone out and <br/>
decline to learn.  They can learn a ton of stuff on their own after school, <br/>
but there is a body of work being presented in a certain way and they are <br/>
expected to regurgitate it on cue.  That is NOTHING like kids being <br/>
unschooled.  They are profoundly different when it comes to learning on ANY <br/>
terms.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Why would we spend the time and energy to homeschool/unschool if our <br/>
kids were going to squander this time. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
First, to say &quot;homeschool/unschool&quot; creates a problem.  If a family is doing <br/>
school-at-home, I put them in the same category as far as time-squander as <br/>
families whose kids are in school.<br/>
<br/>
We need to be talking about unschooling here as a separate entity or the <br/>
discussions will be very muddy and not too useful.<br/>
<br/>
An unschooler whose parents are aware and are not themselves zoned out and <br/>
lazy will not be able to &quot;squander&quot; time.  He is living time.<br/>
<br/>
If you think of the deeper meanings and connotations of &quot;killing time,&quot; <br/>
&quot;wasting time,&quot; and &quot;squandering time,&quot; it&#39;s pretty hard to apply that in the <br/>
absence of a big deadline, or to apply it to a family in which each day&#39;s <br/>
happiness is the goal.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;m sure many of you will say there is no such thing as a child <br/>
squandering his time.  As long as there are interesting things to do, <br/>
children will choose those things eventually - when they are bored.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They will  NOT choose everything eventually.  They will choose the things <br/>
that interest them or are important to them.<br/>
<br/>
If all you had was a can of lima beans and some soda crackers, and you were <br/>
locked in a building for a week, I bet you would eat lima beans and soda <br/>
crackers.  But if those things were in a pantry which was replenished weekly, <br/>
you might NEVER eat lima beans.  And so what???<br/>
<br/>
Do you mean to induce the desire for lima beans?  Do you think a child is <br/>
being wasteful if he doesn&#39;t want every aspect of learning that the parent <br/>
can imagine?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If this is true, children that have been schooled may need some help <br/>
with direction. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They need a boost to get to the point that they themselves trust that what <br/>
they&#39;re learning is useful.  And the parents need to believe that too.  <br/>
Looking for school-learning in everyday life isn&#39;t the ultimate goal.  It&#39;s <br/>
seeing what &quot;school learning&quot; can be from the other side.  Kids will not <br/>
spontaneously discover long division in its traditional notation.  But kids <br/>
WILL discover how to divide somehow in their heads.  And then when they&#39;re 18 <br/>
or whenever they see that little (artificial) arrangement of numbers and <br/>
symbos they will be able to understand in about ten seconds how it works.  <br/>
It&#39;s not the notation that&#39;s primary in the real world, it&#39;s the <br/>
understanding.  In school, the notation is IT and if you don&#39;t really <br/>
understand the concept, people don&#39;t much care as long as you&#39;ve worked your <br/>
30 problems (or copied them from another kid).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;m wondering if this is true for children that have been in school <br/>
for 6 or 7 years like mine.  I remember reading in one of Holt&#39;s <br/>
books that children that have been schooled can&#39;t be left alone to <br/>
learn. .&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ll need some deschooling, not some continuation of school-style life--IF <br/>
you want to unschool.  <br/>
<br/>
Kids who are depressed or wish they were in school can squander their <br/>
unschooling opportunities.  But those who are enthusiastic about unschooling <br/>
will sooner come to the &quot;flow zone&quot; and they need enthusiastic and trusting <br/>
parents to help them get there!<br/>

smelling flowers on the viburnum bushes and the monarch butterflies <br/>
and the girls wanted to feed the butterflies with the butterfly <br/>
nectar and butterfly feeder we got at Christmas so we set it all up.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday afternoon our backyard flooded due to a very bad storm.  <br/>
The flood waters swept through my pond and took out all the fish.  We <br/>
spent some time trying to save what we could.<br/>
<br/>
The painted lady butterflies we bought as caterpillars hatched a few <br/>
days ago and we have spent a few minutes here and there watching <br/>
them.  Our cats started attacking their habitat so we decided to let <br/>
them go.  We spent some time enjoying their first flight.<br/>
<br/>
These are such small parts of our day.  Maybe this is all I should be <br/>
expecting????<br/>
