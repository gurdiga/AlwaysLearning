<div id="ygrps-yiv-1322568059">This video is a talk given by Jane McGonigal, a game designer, and her<br/>
ideas on how games give us the experience of problem solving and help us<br/>
gain optimism about success.  She believes that gaming is an evolutionary<br/>
skill that can be used to solve real life problems.  I thought her ideas<br/>
could be use to some folks here, especially in the gaining new perspective<br/>
on the value of gaming but also provide information on some new gaming<br/>
resources.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-299351120">A friend of our family (a young adult who lived with us during winter 2010) made &#8203;&#8203;us follow this link to the presentation of McGonigal last year. We watched it in family and it helped us all to have particular evidence and arguments FOR video games because it is a very difficult subject to handle in our midst who still relies on psys who give their opinion in magazines and newspapers on education and such opinions are almost always negative and say that the time for video games and the type of games should always be controlled.<br/>
<br/>
Since then, we have also seen that McGonigal published a book on the subject.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-387229859">Yes, a very good book I highly recommend: &quot;Reality is broken&quot; It really<br/>
helped me change the way I look at video games and the support I give my<br/>
children in playing them.<br/>
