<div id="ygrps-yiv-1074939637">Absolutely true. Listening is not reading...<br/>
<br/>
Objects of worship need to have paper, the fewer **pictures** the<br/>
more holy, the nicer the cover the more reverence.<br/>
<br/>
(I sent it out with &quot;the fewer words&quot; but that&#39;s not what I meant.<br/>
I&#39;m kind of out of it the past couple of days; sorry.)<br/>

<br/>
I thought this was so interesting, because my thoughts immediately went <br/>
to the Judaism I grew up with, and how book-worship might figure into <br/>
that tradition... being the &#39;people of the book&#39; and all. <br/>
<br/>
So, first, given that there wasn&#39;t technology/media, and writing/paper <br/>
were the only choice aside from oral tradition, Judaism doesn&#39;t fit into <br/>
that category of what objects of worship need to have, at least in my <br/>
mind.  The Torah, when looked at from outside of the tradition looks <br/>
like the book Sandra described - a modern printed book, with gold leafed <br/>
edges, and a ribbon to mark your place. <br/>
<br/>
But... traditional Jews don&#39;t see that as the book of worship.  That is <br/>
just a &#39;copy.&#39;  The real thing is read from, listened to, read out loud <br/>
by a live person, every week.  And its not a &#39;book.&#39;   Its a scroll, <br/>
printed on animal hide of some sort, written by hand by a special <br/>
scribe.  The book itself as tons of words, and the letters themselves <br/>
are derived from &#39;pictures&#39; of a sort (Aleph, the first letter of the <br/>
alephbet, represents of Ram, Bet, the second letter, is a picture of a <br/>
house, etc).  And then the Rabbis throughout history took each of those <br/>
words and added more words of interpretation (which gives me problems in <br/>
other ways... but its intriguing and mind-boggling the sheer quantity of <br/>
interpretation that Judaism encouraged, and also the inter-connectdness <br/>
of the interpretations, and also the fact that people who lived together <br/>
and believed the same things often came up with completely opposing <br/>
understandings of the texts). <br/>
<br/>
Oh, and its interesting that the written Torah is considered only equal <br/>
in holiness/value, not more, to the Oral Tradition, which is less widely <br/>
known about among non-Jews and non-traditional Jews. <br/>
<br/>
Oh, also interesting.  The way the Torah is learned is not through <br/>
reading, or listening, its through discussion.  The traditional method <br/>
of Jewish &quot;education&quot; is actually called &#39;learning&#39; not teaching or <br/>
education.  And the form is for two people who are partnered up to <br/>
learn/translate/read a particular part of the text, and then sit and <br/>
argue about its meaning.  Argument is the principle method of <br/>
understanding meaning.  Isn&#39;t that interesting?  I&#39;m fascinated <br/>
sometimes with that, because its a completely different understanding of <br/>
how learning occurs from mainstream education... and it seems extra <br/>
strange to me that religious Jewish schools still use that form of <br/>
learning for those subjects, but have completely taken up the mainstream <br/>
understanding of education for the modern subjects.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;ve gone off topic for a moment.  But I thought the book thing <br/>
was interesting. Are other religions this way? <br/>
