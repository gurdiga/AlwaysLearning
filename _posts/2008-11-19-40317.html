<div id="ygrps-yiv-2120394698">I don&#39;t know why it would be unhealthy to sleep on a different<br/>
schedule. Why would there be a relationship between getting enough<br/>
sleep later in on in the day than getting enough sleep earlier on? It<br/>
seems that sleeping in late would offset going to bed late. Linnaea<br/>
stopped taking naps around 2 and she started going to sleep earlier. It<br/>
wasn&#39;t planned, it just happened. Simon is only now, at 11, staying up<br/>
late and sleeping in. He&#39;s still asleep on the floor behind me after a<br/>
sleepover last night, it&#39;s 10 am. Much later in the day, I think he got up at about 11. <br/>
<br/>
It was actually earlier than 2. There is a legend of my sleeplessness as a young, young child. My family including my paternal grandparents were camping in Washington, I&#39;m trying to figure out how old I would have been. I would have been 22 months to 25 months. Anyhow. We had a VW van and they set up my bed in the van  as they were worried I would crawl out into Grizzly territory if I&#39;d been in a tent. Everyone else slept in tents. My grandpa got up early or was up late to check the fire or to take a leak, maybe, and I had unrolled the window in the front and was just attempting to crawl out. At 2, the legends tell me, I was wandering the house at night and my parents had to be careful to keep their door closed so that I wouldn&#39;t walk in on them like the boy in the movie Parents and be traumatized for life, of course they weren&#39;t also eating human flesh, which might have taken the edge off my imagined trauma. At 2 I also protested taking naps by running<br/>
 away from home. I was brought back by the police having made it 2 blocks away. I can remember sleeplessness from 4, maybe, maybe 3. I don&#39;t remember sleep at 2. I just e-mailed my mom and she said that she doesn&#39;t remember me EVER sleeping at a &quot;reasonable&quot; hour (the quotes were both mine and hers, the capitals were hers).<br/>

My daughter is 2. She is still nursing and we have co-slept since she<br/>
was 6 months old. What was written above sounds so much like her.<br/>
(Schuyler, how do you know what you were like at 2 yo?? do you<br/>
remember, or is it from family telling you?) She will stay awake until<br/>
she is exhausted. She has never had a set bedtime. Right now if she<br/>
takes a nap she stays up late (the past 4 nights 1 am, 11:45,<br/>
midnight, 11:45) She is also starting to sleep in till 10 or sometimes<br/>
later when she goes to bed late. She has been skipping nap a couple<br/>
times a week starting around her 2nd Birthday (she is almost 2 1/2<br/>
now). So today she skipped nap, and fell asleep at 7 pm. However she<br/>
had a hard day. One of my friends said it can&#39;t be good for her to<br/>
stay up late. I said I think it is ok, she is eating well, sleeping<br/>
when she is tired, usually happy, and growing and healthy. The hard<br/>
part is staying up that late sometimes. I am a night owl too, so it is<br/>
not too much of an issue, but I babysit other children and sometimes I<br/>
have to get up earlier, and she usually wakes up earlier on those days. <br/>
<br/>
I guess for the most part I am really happy with how we are doing<br/>
things, even though I don&#39;t really know anyone else who does it this<br/>
way. It is so encouraging to read about other people&#39;s experience,<br/>
both their own, and their children&#39;s. I wonder if there are other<br/>
things I could do better or differently -- for instance, she loves to<br/>
watch movies and I wonder sometimes if that is just keeping her awake.<br/>
I love the peaceful nights when she goes to sleep so happily, and I<br/>
feel bad when it seems like she is overtired and unhappy (and to<br/>
clarify, she falls asleep where she wants and often with a movie on of<br/>
her choice...) I know if I weren&#39;t working at all (babysitting) it<br/>
would be less of an issue because our schedule would be even more<br/>
relaxed. I am struggling right now with what is the best thing for her<br/>
and our family. I think a lot of people we know in real life think we<br/>
are crazy to &quot;let&quot; her stay up so late. But I don&#39;t look at it that<br/>
way at all -- her internal clock seems set that way and I really<br/>
wouldn&#39;t change how we do things, although I&#39;m not sure about my<br/>
husband! (not that he can complain since I have basically been the one<br/>
helping her fall asleep since she was born!)<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I know I am rambling. If this strikes anyone and they are inspired<br/>
to respond I would really appreciate it!<br/>

in till as late as 2pm, however. He still nurses and co-sleeps, so he<br/>
isn&#39;t sleeping solid through the night, still waking to nurse then<br/>
sleeping more.<br/>

trying to get her to sleep during certain hours because of someone<br/>
else&#39;s expectations. <br/>

particular friend.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This would definitely make it harder. Generally I get to sleep when my<br/>
son sleeps (minus a couple hours on each end); my two daughters are<br/>
fairly self sufficient if our sleep schedules don&#39;t mesh perfectly. <br/>

Hello,<br/>
My dd is 21/2.  she is still nursing(ish) and i have co-slept with her<br/>
since birth (and with her two siblings dd nearly 8 and ds 41/2).<br/>
she has never had a bedtime (neither did the others) becos it just<br/>
didn&#39;t seem to fit with the on demand b/feeding and she (and they)<br/>
just used to fall asleep at the breast when she was tired.  she has<br/>
been on and off napping for about 6/7 months now. if she goes to bed<br/>
late then she wakes up late and then doesn&#39;t need a nap, but if she<br/>
hass gone to bed late and we have had to be somewhere and she has been<br/>
up early then she does still fall asleep in the day.  also as you said<br/>
if she sleeps at all in the day now then she won&#39;t be ready for sleep<br/>
until past midnight.   luckily i can go with the flow as i don&#39;t have<br/>
to be up like u do.  but what i wanted to say is all my children are<br/>
fit and healthy and seem to cope better than most, for example, if i<br/>
know that they could really do with staying in bed but we have to be<br/>
up and about.  <br/>
<br/>
i too have to put up with comments and suggestions from others about<br/>
whether young children should be up so late, but as i have followed my<br/>
instincts as much as possible from the moment they were born then i<br/>
feel confident that it will be ok.  my husband too is taking some<br/>
convincing and is mainly ok with it until we hit a spot where i might<br/>
be tired and could just do with someone else being around.  he then<br/>
throws at me that children should be in bed asleep or a least in their<br/>
rooms after a certain time.<br/>
<br/>
the only downside sometimes is little people around when we might want<br/>
to just have an evening together, but we stay up late and just get<br/>
some time in when they have all nodded off.<br/>
<br/>
don&#39;t know if i&#39;ve helped.<br/>
<br/>
