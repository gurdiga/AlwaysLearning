<div id="ygrps-yiv-1101388953">My kids were talking about this in the car.  <br/>
<br/>
5 yo: Mommy, remember when you said that me could live with you <br/>
forever instead of getting my own house when?  <br/>
<br/>
Me: Yes?<br/>
<br/>
5 year old:  Well, me might miss you if me lived in my own house <br/>
without you.  <br/>
<br/>
Me:  Well, you can do whatever you want to do.  <br/>
<br/>
7 year old:  Luke, I don&#39;t know yet what I&#39;m going to do.  There&#39;s no <br/>
use trying to decide what to do now, because by the time we&#39;re old we <br/>
might change our minds.  <br/>
<br/>
5 year old:  Oh yeah!  Maybe me just don&#39;t know what me is going to <br/>
do yet.  (He doesn&#39;t seem to like the word &quot;I&quot;--lol?)<br/>
<br/>
My 11 year old stayed quiet during the discussion, but she has told <br/>
me that if she gets married she would like to live with us.  I told <br/>
her maybe we could put some plumbing and heat in the 2nd floor of our <br/>
garage, which isn&#39;t connected to the house, and she and her husband <br/>
can live there and come to the house when they need the kitchen.  She <br/>
loved that idea! lol  I wonder if her future husband will like that <br/>
idea. ;)<br/>
