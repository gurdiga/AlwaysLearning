<div id="ygrps-yiv-1545676118">I&#39;ve been working a lot the last couple of days, so just caught up with the <br/>
messages! Ack.<br/>
Let&#39;s see if I can remember everything I wanted to respond to........<br/>
<br/>
Thank you Sandra, for the compliment about my dh. I think he&#39;s a hunk!  We&#39;ve <br/>
been triathlon training and his body is shaping up VERY nicely (you know, the <br/>
lean biker type) . Aaah, but I won&#39;t go there.<br/>
He&#39;s been told about four times in the last month (by perfect strangers) that <br/>
he looks like Rick Springsteen??!! I don&#39;t see it. I think he&#39;s hunky, but I <br/>
don&#39;t see the Springsteen look at all. <br/>
As to the hair issue....<br/>
I love him with a three day growth look, kinda stubbly and rugged looking. He <br/>
always looked that way when we did mountain climbing and it always attracted <br/>
me. That outdoor, hiker dude look, YK?<br/>
I&#39;ve pushed him to grow his hair long again but he swears it affects people&#39;s <br/>
decision to hire you down here. I believe him.<br/>
Some jobs it doesn&#39;t matter, others it might.<br/>
Now here&#39;s the rub, he shaved his LEGS!! Yep, right down to the smooth skin. <br/>
YUCKO. I can&#39;t stand it. He did it to see what those &quot;real&quot; biker/triathlete <br/>
types go through. He says it feels better because your bike tights don&#39;t pull <br/>
on the hairs, I guess it&#39;s annoying. But I HATE the smooth leg look on a guy. <br/>
I can live with short head hair if he&#39;ll just grow the damn leg hair back.<br/>
My FIL shaved his beard after 30+ years of having it and my kids didn&#39;t <br/>
recognize him....I wouldn&#39;t have either except for the voice!! He grew it <br/>
back when the kids were afraid to come too close.<br/>
<br/>
I just had to comment on NM too. We spent very little time there, but thought <br/>
Santa Fe was magical! We had some wonderful moments there. As we walked <br/>
through downtown a light snow began to fall and the kids positively DANCED up <br/>
the street, twirling and laughing and throwing their heads back to catch <br/>
snowflakes. We visited that little chapel with the &quot;miracle&quot; winding <br/>
staircase, it was warm and welcoming after dancing in the snow. We spent part <br/>
of a day at the little children&#39;s museum where the kids met a local artist <br/>
and created sculptures to be auctioned off for support of the animal shelter.<br/>
Great memories.<br/>
And although Alamagordo didn&#39;t offer much, we had a BLAST at White Sands <br/>
Monument! The sand looked so inviting and we all slid down it. But it was <br/>
bloody COLD sand in November! We saw a Stealth fighter fly overhead which <br/>
really was impressive. The mountains and natural beauty were refreshing. We <br/>
would definitely visit again.<br/>
<br/>
Our beaches have sand as white as that White Sands Monument though! And I can <br/>
swim too....well, at least most of the year. Anyone that wants to see our <br/>
beaches can look in the photo section...I posted one of dh and kids from 1998 <br/>
when we first arrived here (so no Jalen in the pic). We love <br/>
visitors...unfortunately don&#39;t have enough room in our little house for <br/>
overnighters, but if anyone comes through please let me know!! I&#39;m a good <br/>
tour guide...there&#39;s plenty of kid friendly activities around, even without <br/>
the beach.<br/>
