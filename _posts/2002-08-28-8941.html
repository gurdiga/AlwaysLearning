<div id="ygrps-yiv-1923164908">My 16ds has been &quot;gaming&quot; for years.  Some of his favorites, right now, are <br/>
Starcraft and Final FantasyII.  I was reading Mary Gold&#39;s article If You Give <br/>
a Kid a Nintendo; it&#39;s wonderful!  If you haven&#39;t read it yet, get to <br/>
Sandra&#39;s website and do it!<br/>
<br/>
So, I have this son, like I&#39;ve said and he has spent most of his time emersed <br/>
in video games and all that entails (read Mary&#39;s article).  I&#39;m trying to put <br/>
together a &quot;transcript&quot; and am needing some ideas for translating these <br/>
gaming activities into subjects.  Any brainstorming with me would help.   <br/>
Thanks!</div>

 </span></blockquote>Why do you need to translate gaming into subjects? Is this for fulfilling a <br/>
state required report? If so, you could say things like...<br/>
Worked on activities to build hand eye coordination.<br/>
Developed problem solving skills in math and language arts.<br/>
(if he likes to write his own *games* you could say...)<br/>
Advanced writing skills<br/>
Learned computer graphics and languages. <br/>
Developed an understanding of scientific inquiry. <br/>
Improved reading levels and mastery of the English language.<br/>
Foreign language skills.<br/>
<br/>
Does this help at all? &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Hi Nancy,<br/>
  The only reason I&#39;m even doing this is because my son has told me he would <br/>
like to go to the community college when he&#39;s eighteen.  So instead of having <br/>
to rack my brain for a 4 year transcript and not lie, I want to go ahead and <br/>
do it one year at a time or whenever I think of it.  (Although I&#39;m usually <br/>
famous for waiting to the last minute to do everything!)<br/>
   I also want to write a transcript in language the college will understand, <br/>
you know, &quot;play the game&quot;.  <br/>
Your suggestions are a great help, thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Joy</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1332990595">My experience in community college required no transcripts at all<br/>
(Particularly those students older than 18). Many allow homeschoolers to<br/>
take classes as young as 14.<br/>
