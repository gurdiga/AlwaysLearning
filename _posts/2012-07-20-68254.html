<div id="ygrps-yiv-764043502">My 10 year old (can&#39;t believe he turned 10 yesterday!) received a cotton candy maker from his grandma and grandpa for his birthday.  We popped it out last night, and it was so easy and FUN!  The plate to melt the candy spins and gets hot, so supervision as needed by your family.  Thought I would share this.  I would have never thought to buy one, but my mom is more fun than me! :D<br/>
<br/>
Here is a link to it on amazon  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Nostalgia-Electrics-PCM-805RETRORED-Series-Sugar-Free/dp/B004XD8FFW/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1342739322&sr=8-2&keywords=cotton+candy+maker">http://www.amazon.com/Nostalgia-Electrics-PCM-805RETRORED-Series-Sugar-Free/dp/B004XD8FFW/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1342739322&sr=8-2&keywords=cotton+candy+maker</a></div>

Speaking of home made commercial products, did you know you can make marshmallows at home? Kat got a big kick out of doing that. Alton Brown has a recipe: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://goo.gl/WhIr">http://goo.gl/WhIr</a><br/>
<br/>
Kat and I also made mayonnaise in the food processor. And butter in a jar.<br/>
<br/>
This suggests kneading the butter to get the rest of the buttermilk out so it won&#39;t spoil:<br/>

<br/>
(Ours was eaten too quickly to spoil ;-) I do remember big butter paddles at various demonstrations of early American cooking that were used for that purpose:<br/>
<br/>
Which would go with some Irish Soda Bread which is quick and very easy to make. :-)<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t make these but would have if I&#39;d thought of them!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1203584085">We&#39;ve made butter in a jar, and hired a fairy floss (cotton candy) machine for my five year olds birthday.<br/>
<br/>
We also make yoghurt from milk and a small amount of natural yoghurt in a yoghurt maker I got from an Aldi store for $20. Sushi is fun and easy too, I buy the kits from the supermarket sometimes, and the finished results are delicious, if less pretty than the bought ones.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m planning to try this soon; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.naturalhealthstrategies.com/how-to-make-chocolate.html.">http://www.naturalhealthstrategies.com/how-to-make-chocolate.html.</a>  And ice cream!  I read about making a small amount fly mixing cream and sugar in a plastic bag over ice and salt. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://chemistry.about.com/cs/howtos/a/aa020404a.htm.">http://chemistry.about.com/cs/howtos/a/aa020404a.htm.</a><br/>
