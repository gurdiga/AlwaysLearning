<div id="ygrps-yiv-1342256583">Hi all ­ I&#39;m an unschooling mom to 2  boys (9 and 5) and a reader of this<br/>
list, but a new poster.<br/>
<br/>
In my circle (not un or homeschooling), there has been a rash of unexpected<br/>
parental death recently.  It makes us realize more fully the importance of<br/>
our unfinished wills and assignment of guardians for our children in the<br/>
case that something should happen to both of us.  We have dithered since the<br/>
beginning about whom to ask to fill the guardian role.  I&#39;m curious about<br/>
how others have done this.  Our considerations include: staying close by<br/>
geographically vs going to a godparent far away, staying within our church<br/>
community vs. moving across town with an aunt (which would almost be like<br/>
moving far away geographically as we&#39;re in a metropolitan area and aunt&#39;s<br/>
circle doesn&#39;t overlap ours), asking our closest family friends with kids<br/>
the same age who are rather overwhelmed with their own kids (might be a<br/>
better choice as the youngest kids approach 10yo).  And on top of that how<br/>
to ask a guardian to continue homeschooling, preferably unschooling.  We are<br/>
just starting to get to know other unschoolers in our area and don&#39;t have<br/>
any likely candidates.  Do you pick unschoolers over other things even if<br/>
you&#39;re not crazy about all the other family&#39;s choices.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t usually spend a lot of time worrying about risks that are this<br/>
small, but this is a biggy.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to hear your considerations and thought process in this decision.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Katie<br/>
<br/>

Unless you have a BUNCH of money are are offering to support the potential guardian fully (financially), you can&#39;t really ask such a thing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1112880372">I agree with Sandra without financial backing you can&#39;t really ask such a thing. And beyond the cost there is also the tremendous time commitment and possible philosophical disagreements. <br/>
<br/>
I do, however, think it would be reasonable to request they attend a free school or democratic school if such a thing exists in your area and you can provide financial support for - maybe with a life insurance policy specifically for such a thing.<br/>
<br/>
If unschooling/homeschooling is a priority for your kids and your family have you considered asking a close friend who also shares these values? We have good friends who unschool and if anything happened to us one or all of our kids would likely stay with them. It is easier for us because our kids are teens...but I think it is important to talk to your kids about this too. What would they want? Are they capable or willing to express preferences if needed...etc.<br/>
<br/>
Now, friendships often ebb and flow but you can always change the guardian if need be. We&#39;ve at different times had different family members as potential guardians based on what is happening in the family...situations change just as relationships. Just because an individual or couple may fit as a potential guardian now it by no means you are obligated to keep them as guardian if your feelings/circumstances change. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-51729834">When our kids were younger, we had paperwork in place to make my friend Jeff their guardian.  As they got older, he got married and had kids who were in school, I had talked to him about hiring someone to stay with them at our house, making sure they had what they needed.  He would have been financial, legal guardian but would have hired a caretaker (or couple or family) with the kids&#39; advice and approval.  We had ideas as time went by who it might have been.  He knew some of my unschooling friends and could have taken advice from them, too.<br/>
<br/>
We would have left enough money to support the house and kids.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re grown now.  We were lucky.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-427963703">we are actually meeting with our attorney (and my employer) who specializes<br/>
in family estate planning today to do just this.  we have my mom and<br/>
another unschooling friend (both in a different state from us, but the same<br/>
town as each other) listed as guardians.  we are lucky in that our kids<br/>
would continue to be unschooled in that situation, by default.  we&#39;d leave<br/>
money, for their care, but keeping them home from school wouldn&#39;t increase<br/>
the costs to the guardians because they are already home with their kids.<br/>
 also, we plan to put into writing that if something should happen to us in<br/>
the next year (when my daughter will be 18, she could be emancipated.  it&#39;s<br/>
really important to do the guardianship designation correctly (for your<br/>
state), because done incorrectly, there are many loopholes and caveats that<br/>
can cause problems, even when you think it&#39;s been taken care of.  here&#39;s an<br/>
article our attorney wrote on the subject:<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
it&#39;s for oregon, but mostly applies to other states as well, i think<br/>
