<div id="ygrps-yiv-246462061">Hi All-<br/>
<br/>
My boys have been working on this game for some time and are looking forward<br/>
to sharing it with others.  It is free and they welcome any input and<br/>
suggestions.  <br/>
<br/>
Please let me apologize if you have received duplicate emails as I have sent<br/>
this to many lists and also if it was sent to a list that this would not be<br/>
welcomed on.  <br/>
<br/>
I am passing on their message (below).<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
<br/>
Joan<br/>
<br/>
Here is their message:<br/>
<br/>
We welcome you to the open-beta testing of this new 2D MMORPG <br/>
<br/>
(Massively multiplayer online role-playing game)<br/>
<br/>
 5.bmp<br/>
<br/>
With over 200 maps to explore and many monsters to fight on diverse maps.<br/>
With a growing array of weapons and spells. And seven character classes to<br/>
choose from such as;<br/>
<br/>
Warrior<br/>
<br/>
Ninja<br/>
<br/>
Paladin<br/>
<br/>
Samurai<br/>
<br/>
Elysium<br/>
<br/>
Keyblader<br/>
<br/>
Ranger<br/>
<br/>
14.bmp<br/>
<br/>
All with specific weapon classes and armor classes that make each character<br/>
well rounded and specifically designed for certain areas of combat, such as<br/>
ranged,  magic or close quarters, to name a few.<br/>
<br/>
The Elysium is a heavy blade character that specializes in defense, a great<br/>
tank when partied with other players.<br/>
<br/>
The Samurai is the Elysium&#39;s opposite; it is also a heavy bladed character<br/>
but specializes in offense.<br/>
<br/>
The Keyblader is a magic type that is also able to stand its own on the<br/>
field solo, or with a party casting devastating attack spells and buffs<br/>
along with its own array of healing abilities.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The Paladin unlike the Keyblader is a healing specific character also able<br/>
to hold its own in a one-on-one fight.<br/>
<br/>
The Ninja is a stealth character using a spear it grants the ability to hit<br/>
enemies from a distance rather than up front, evasion and attack gives the<br/>
Ninja the edge on the field.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Ranger, who cannot use a Ninja&#39;s abilities, makes up for it by<br/>
being able to hit an enemy from anywhere on the field as long as there&#39;s a<br/>
straight clear shot.  Stopping an enemy before it can even reach the<br/>
character.<br/>
<br/>
The warrior is the basic well-rounded close quarter&#39;s combat character for<br/>
players who are new to these games and are looking to just have some casual<br/>
fun.<br/>
<br/>
As for the other side of the game, there are rich quests with intense 2D<br/>
story-lines that drive the character to explore new worlds and areas; to<br/>
fight unthinkable creatures in hopes of finding cures for the infected and<br/>
lost cities full of wondrous things, also allowing the character to acquire<br/>
unique weapons far greater than their basic weapons, such as the Leaf Blade<br/>
and more, with some quests class specific for items only usable by that<br/>
class. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
So please come and immerse yourself in an adventure worthy of the 2D worlds,<br/>
and invite your friends to come par-take in exploring new lands and fighting<br/>
different creatures at every map and worlds edge!<br/>
