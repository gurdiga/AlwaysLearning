<div id="ygrps-yiv-251226327"><br>This is two questions, but it might be one question.&nbsp; As things have started getting better in my family, and I&#39;ve been learning how to do things better, and understanding how to use principles more, a lot of painful childhood memories have been surfacing, and I feel like I&#39;ve been in a pretty intense, unexpected grieving process.&nbsp; I&#39;m really grateful for it, especially for the moments where I feel the connection between how doing better for my own children has helped my healing.<br><br>I have found lately, as I&#39;ve been coming to a new awareness of and processing these feelings and memories from childhood, that I&#39;ve struggled with making the better choice, even when I remember it, or am aware of it.&nbsp; Not always, but often enough that I feel almost like I&#39;ve slipped back to where I was when I first started.&nbsp; I think part of my problem might be that exact thought - I<span style="font-style:italic;"> have</span> slipped back, but certainly progress, and an emerging awareness of what is going on, why, and what I can do about it,<span style="font-style:italic;"> is</span> there.&nbsp; <br><br>I feel like, in spite of having experienced so many wonderful moments, and seen how joyfully daily life can unfold when I make better choices, I&#39;m choosing to go backward, and I don&#39;t understand it.&nbsp; At least not fully, not yet.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know if feelings are just really raw and real for me now in a way they weren&#39;t before, and it&#39;s uncomfortable, so I&#39;m shrinking away?&nbsp; <br><br>This might be better material for a therapist, than this list.&nbsp; But in the meantime, while I&#39;m looking for one of those, what are some suggestions? In addition to (or expansion on) &quot;being my children&#39;s mother, instead of my mother&#39;s child,&quot; which has been swirling around my thoughts a lot lately.<br><br>The second question, or related question, is that all of this is also coming up in the same few months as I&#39;ve started my period again, after a three year break, and it&#39;s been more intense than I ever remember it being - way heavier and more cramping and fatigue than I experienced before having my second child.&nbsp; I feel like the week leading up to and the first few days are particularly challenging as far as my mood goes - I mean, I was downright bitchy today, and thankfully I kept most of it in my head, but it still had a big impact on my how negative and grouchy and ill-willfull I felt - especially toward my husband.&nbsp; And here&#39;s where there&#39;s great evidence that I haven&#39;t *totally* slipped back - I recognized all those negative feelings, was able to take deep breaths and remind myself, &#39;he&#39;s doing his best,&#39; think about what is positive, and not say anything really mean, apologize for the bit of snarky micromanaging I did, and finally was able to pull myself out of it before the day was done, and go out with my kids, let my husband relax at home, and the boys and I had a great time eating french fries, and playing at the park, and singing &#39;Frozen heart&#39; on repeat in the car, by my 4 yr old&#39;s request (man that is a GREAT song to stamp out some frustrations to, while feeling moved and epic and wonderful! It really carries you away from frustration, and toward strength and marvel), and the evening ended on a very nice note. <br><br>But yeah, I don&#39;t know if these two issues (the psychological ones, and the hormonal ones) are related, or compounding on each other, or what.&nbsp; So, suggestions in that vein, or on coping with the moodiness of PMS would be very welcome too. &nbsp; <br><br>Thank you, so much, <br><br>Lisa C</div>

<div>-== But yeah, I don&#39;t know if these two issues (the psychological ones, and 
the hormonal ones) are related, or compounding on each other, or what.&nbsp; So, 
suggestions in that vein, or on coping with the moodiness of PMS would be very 
welcome too. -=-</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>They are definitely related!&nbsp; I go through this, too.&nbsp; From what 
I have read &amp; experienced, the monthly cycle is a way for women to 
cleanse.&nbsp; This is a physical &amp; emotional cleansing.&nbsp; The emotional 
issues that are needing to be dealt with are raw &amp; near the surface during 
this time.&nbsp; They are trying to get your attention &amp; say &quot;look at me, I 
am here &amp; I&nbsp;want to be processed&quot;.&nbsp; When I have a month where I&#39;m 
processing a lot of big things I will have a difficult period.&nbsp; I am just 
finishing one of those difficult cycles.&nbsp; I think this month for me it has 
been&nbsp;triggered&nbsp;by the difficult emotions surrounding the 
serious&nbsp;illness of a&nbsp;sweet young friend. &nbsp;I have cried a lot this 
past week &amp; been really emotional.&nbsp; And not just emotional about the 
illness, lots of pain from my own childhood has been coming out.&nbsp; Things 
that were lingering around inside &amp; I thought &quot;why am I crying over this 
now?&nbsp; I thought I had already processed this stuff?&quot;&nbsp; I also have 
slipped back with how I&#39;ve been treating my family.&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I&#39;ve been through this cycle enough times now to recognize that I&#39;m 
actually making progress.&nbsp; When I have these feelings come up I do my best 
to process them &amp; release them.&nbsp; Once the intense period of hormone 
induced emotions has subsided I am able to reflect more rationally on those 
emotions and continue to work through them.&nbsp; It is actually a gift that 
these things are able to crop to the surface and give us the opportunity to 
become aware that these emotions are still in there &amp; give us the chance to 
work through and release.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>After a difficult cycle has passed I do feel cleaner &amp; fresher 
inside.&nbsp; I am aware that going through that process has not been a set 
back, it has helped to move me forward.&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The more I have healed myself the more I have had cycles where I feel 
quite&nbsp;emotionally stable &amp; my period is quite light.&nbsp; Having a 
difficult cycle is becoming quite&nbsp;rare now.&nbsp; When I do have one I 
think &quot;oh good, let&#39;s get some more of this dysfunctional junk out of 
here&quot;.&nbsp; Well, I try to remind myself of that anyway!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>So I would say that&nbsp;your slipping backwards is only a temporary 
thing.&nbsp; It&#39;s like cleaning house.&nbsp; If you want to clean a closet you 
take a lot of the stuff out &amp; it looks like a huge mess.&nbsp; But you are 
straightening &amp; organizing, getting rid of stuff you don&#39;t need 
anymore.&nbsp; In the end the closet will be much better off for your 
efforts.&nbsp; </div>

<div>
<div>-=-&nbsp; I also have slipped back with how I&#39;ve been treating my 
family.&nbsp; -=-</div>
<div>&nbsp;I do try not to let the negative emotions effect my family but when 
you are a close family &amp; a member is struggling the others 
are&nbsp;obviously going to be effected by that.&nbsp; My kids are a little 
older so I try to explain to them what I am going through &amp; that&nbsp;my 
crankiness&nbsp;not their fault.&nbsp; I apologize a lot.&nbsp; When I&#39;m tempted 
to say really hurtful things I try to quickly remind myself of how that will 
make the other person feel &amp; sort of imagine that my mouth has been sewn 
shut! &nbsp; I take baths where I can cry my heart out privately.&nbsp; I give 
lots of big hugs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I try to make up for it after it has 
passed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>My son told my husband yesterday &quot;it&#39;s really annoying when mom gets like 
that&quot; and he said &quot;I hear that!&quot; and gave him a high five.&nbsp; I laughed 
when&nbsp;my husband&nbsp;told me that &amp; was glad they had each other.&nbsp; 
I try super hard, but I am not perfect.&nbsp; I&#39;m a lot better than I&#39;d be if I 
weren&#39;t trying so hard!!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>And like I said, the more time that passes, the more issues I work through, 
the&nbsp;calmer &amp; more emotionally stable&nbsp;I get.&nbsp; THAT is 
priceless.&nbsp; I do not know where I&#39;d be in the process without this 
group!!&nbsp;</div></div></html></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1726702142">Yes, it can free.  You can learn how to do it from the link I posted, and from YouTube.  Unschooling for adults!  It is a tool that might help pinpoint that person into living in the moment.  It is very helpful when dealing with and helping to eliminate past traumas, which sometimes hinder us from living in the moment as the previous poster has said she is struggling with.  <br>

And putting the principles into practice in my own life as well as theirs has made me a much better unschooler, I think.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1744349207">-=-but now I&#39;m no longer fighting my body...-=-<br/>
<br/>
Today I corresponded with a friend who used &quot;battling&quot; about his own emotional situation, and of his wife&#39;s medical condition said &quot;fighting&quot; and  &quot;I&#39;m still in there swinging.....&quot; which can be a baseball idiom, but because he&#39;s been involved in medieval sword fighting for much of his life, it&#39;s probably more combative, in his mind.<br/>
<br/>
If I had collected the times people had used combative language about their children... I&#39;d have another page on my site, and I probably have enough.<br/>
<br/>
But when a person changes from the adversarial besieged &quot;have to&quot; stance to a softer, thoughtful position, they can have results like Bernadette Lynn is reporting:  She made simple changes and felt much better.<br/>
<br/>
When a parent feels better and is more at peace, and more centered, and more able to think clearly, unschooling will work better.  Parenting will be better.  The lives of the other people in that family will be better.</div>

I know I&#39;m the one who let posts through that were going off topic, but please be careful about messing too much with natural processes.<br/>
<br/>
-=-You may be estrogen heavy, which can cause mood swings, painful periods, and intense PMS. You can get tested by your doctor and if you are you can buy a natural progesterone topical cream to help balance your hormones.  I have found this cream very helpful.

The same parents who would not screw with a child&#39;s development by giving them hormones should be very, very wary of rubbing horse estrogen and other animals&#39; hormones in and on themselves.

By using the tools one has learned to be kinder to family members, it should be easier to get through an uncomfortable few years.

Find ways to be more comfortable, yes.  Have a fan on you at night.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-66056318"><p dir="ltr">Just fyi Sandra, the hormone cream I&#39;m talking about is not a prescription or made from any animal products.  The product is made from soy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I suggested talking to a doctor because she may not be sure. I am not an advocate of the artificial animal hormones.  I am very far from menopause (presumably) but have suffered from hormonal imbalance for a few years. I have taken up the natural methods of the topical cream and also taking shatavari and evening primrose oil.  These things have helped tremendously, especially around the time of my period.   </p>

<p dir="ltr">Sorry if this is the wrong place to post such a comment, I was trying to be helpful.</p>

in spite of having experienced so many wonderful moments, and seen how joyfully daily life can unfold when I make better choices, I&#39;m choosing to go backward, and I don&#39;t understand it.&nbsp; At least not fully, not yet.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know if feelings are just really raw and real for me now in a way they weren&#39;t before, and it&#39;s uncomfortable, so I&#39;m shrinking away? &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&nbsp;<br><br> </span></blockquote>When I started processing the trauma from my childhood, I was miserable about my own bad luck. &nbsp;I hadn&#39;t really seen it before. &nbsp;Not knowing any better, I thought it was how everyone lived. &nbsp;Seeing that it wasn&#39;t how everyone lived, and later experiencing for myself a better way to live, left me feeling angry that I hadn&#39;t had a better experience as a child. &nbsp;And, for a short moment in time (that I&#39;m sure felt like an eternity, though I don&#39;t remember any more), I was angry, envious, and had feelings of entitlement, resentment and hopelessness all wrapped up in one tight, short-sighted package. &nbsp;</div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1193346610ygrps-yiv-1350198607"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1193346610ygrps-yiv-1350198607">I recognized living like that was not only toxic for me, but also for those I loved around me. &nbsp;So, I chose to work on letting those feelings process and then move on. &nbsp;Holding on to the resentment was hurting me. &nbsp;I did nice things for myself regularly. &nbsp;I consciously chose to look at the nice things that had been done for me by others, even amidst the difficult times. &nbsp;I forgave the people who fell short in my care. &nbsp;I forgave myself for later doing the same thing to me. &nbsp;I celebrated the blossoming me who made the conscious choice to work toward not perpetuating those patterns I had grown up with. &nbsp;Step by step, slowly and with some set backs, I moved toward some simple goals I had set for myself. &nbsp;To be honest. &nbsp;To be kind. &nbsp;To be generous. &nbsp;To know love.</div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1193346610ygrps-yiv-1350198607"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1193346610ygrps-yiv-1350198607">I still get cranky from time to time, but now that cranky me is more like a friend that gives me clues to what I need to change to move toward more peace. &nbsp;Sandra has a great talk on her sight where she talks about moving across a room one step at a time. &nbsp;Recognizing that becoming a better person was going to take time and commitment helped me a lot. &nbsp;Seeing the results of my efforts encouraged me. &nbsp;Gradually feeling more whole encouraged me. &nbsp;Watching my relationship with my husband strengthen again encouraged me. &nbsp;Witnessing my son grow up whole is the absolute best evidence that I am still moving in a good direction.</div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1193346610ygrps-yiv-1350198607"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1193346610ygrps-yiv-1350198607">The talk I&#39;m
