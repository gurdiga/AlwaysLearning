<div id="ygrps-yiv-382709557">Mary, Tell Casey I&#39;m very sorry for her loss. Losing a special pet friend is <br/>
difficult. I can still cry when I think about my dear friend JoJo, my <br/>
Australian shepard that died when I was 10.<br/>
My best friend in Jr. High had a rat named Templeton that we loved dearly. I <br/>
remember taking Templeton on my shoulder to all my classes at music/art camp <br/>
at the University.<br/>
When he died we placed him in a coffee can, sprinkled him with holy water <br/>
(not sure what made it holy other than the fact that we decided it was) and <br/>
buried him in her back yard with some pomp and circumstance. We even invited <br/>
our siblings to attend, which they did. It was a very proper burial.<br/>
Ritual and ceremony are helpful when you&#39;re sad...a nice way to pay tribute <br/>
to a dear friend.<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>
Ren</div>
