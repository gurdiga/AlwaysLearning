<div id="ygrps-yiv-1766015994">A few days ago at my 8 year old sons soccer game, one of the other mothers made a comment after her son scored a goal, that that goal brought his total up to enough money to get the new ironman video game.  In other words, she pays him 5 dollars for each goal he scores at our rec league (we dont officially keep score) soccer games. I know of one other mother there who does the same thing.<br/>
At first the idea of it seemed even sillier than someone paying their kids for grades but then I thought it was about the same.<br/>
The more I thought about it the more I wondered what these people are thinking.  I get that some people think that until a child has the intrinsic motivation to do something than giving them extrensic motivation is important but this is a sport that these kids supposedly cant get enough of and love. I know people that pay their kids to read for that reason.<br/>
I dont realy have a question about this but am trying to understand.</div>

players put it into their contracts to get bonuses based on things like <br/>
&quot;no goals scored against&quot; for a goalkeeper or &quot;number of assists&quot; for a <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Some baseball players (the SUPER successful ones) also have bonuses written into their contracts based on the number of hits per season and number of winning games per season (for pitchers).  A whole team will get a bonus if they win Championships or the World Series.  I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if there were other &quot;incentives&quot; in contracts too.  <br/>

<br/>
The reward as motivation didn&#39;t bother me so much as the symbolism of the<br/>
reward in the relationship. Motivation is motivation. I don&#39;t see why one<br/>
kind is better than the other unless it somehow excludes the other. Fair<br/>
enough if a kid wants to earn pocket money playing soccer rather than mowing<br/>
lawns - whether he enjoys it or not. However, i am concerned about how we as<br/>
parents may attach value to certain kinds of outcomes and promote them,<br/>
perhaps leading to associations about what we value in them.<br/>
<br/>
I mean if it were an employee or a professional player, it is performance<br/>
they are getting paid for, and it is being paid to deliver taken to<br/>
appreciative levels. Deliver outstanding, get paid more - kind of thing. The<br/>
professional is paid to do his job to begin with. It is what the whole<br/>
relationship between the payer and payee is about. I don&#39;t know if I would<br/>
be able to create those kinds of dynamics and still balance them out with a<br/>
whole life perspective with my own child. Or perhaps I fear that I may not<br/>
be able to convey what i see as precious eloquently enough to register along<br/>
with the &#39;hard facts&#39; of money. I&#39;d better get to work on appreciating him<br/>
better anyway :D<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If people were mechanical beings and motivation were fuel that might  <br/>
be true. But motivation is wrapped up in emotion and someone&#39;s  <br/>
relationship with what they&#39;re doing.<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be difficult for a child not to change their  <br/>
relationship with soccer if they were being paid by the goal, even if  <br/>
it was for pocket money instead of incentive to do better (or do their  <br/>
&quot;best&quot; or whatever the parent believes they&#39;re encouraging.)<br/>
<br/>
It would also change their relationship with the team from one of  <br/>
working for the *team* to score goals rather than for them to score  <br/>
goals. I doubt any parent would be helping a kid earn pocket money by  <br/>
watching TV ;-) The parent will pay for what they value. Even saying  <br/>
&quot;Good job!&quot; can be problematical if the parent is focusing on  <br/>
accomplishing a task that&#39;s generally seen as admirable by society  <br/>
rather than the child and their relationship with what they&#39;ve done.  <br/>
It&#39;s better to tune into what the child feels rather than what they&#39;ve  <br/>
accomplished. (So a parent can sincerely say &quot;Cool!&quot; when a child says  <br/>
they&#39;ve beaten a level on a game that was giving them trouble. :-)<br/>
<br/>
The discussion ties in with a video someone posted on Facebook  <br/>
yesterday about motivation. They did studies on how rewards influenced  <br/>
performance. They found that rewards for purely mechanical skills  <br/>
increased performance. But when a task that needs even rudimentary  <br/>
cognitive skills (I think is how it was put) is rewarded, the  <br/>
performance actually decreases. Totally counterintuitive. They even  <br/>
had the experiment repeated in India where the decent reward ($50) for  <br/>
doing puzzles and shooting baskets stretched to 2 months salary.  <br/>
Didn&#39;t matter. The outcome was the same: performance decreased.<br/>
<br/>
The video is fascinating in that it also goes onto explore how some  <br/>
innovative companies are tapping into people&#39;s intrinsic motivation to  <br/>
work on and improve in what they enjoy.<br/>

This to me make sense and is not surprising at all. To put it simply...If you have this monetary reward in your brain you have all kinds of thinking going on about that cluttering up your focus. You could be either planning what to do with the money, stressing about not getting it, fearful of losing it (because when you take on the task some folks might take ownership of it already)...and any number of other things you are trying to simultaneously work out. <br/>

I agree cool video. I didn&#39;t get some of the political connections he made. Some made sense others I think were way off...just the political stuff.<br/>

<br/>
That makes sense in relation to professional sports where the ultimate goal is profits. The more wins the team has, the more money the owner makes so the more money gets trickled down. I&#39;m not sure how it applies to parents paying their young children to play well. Sports are very important to some parents for the future of their children. They&#39;re hoping for college scholarships. They envision their 4 and 5 year olds becoming professional athletes from playing tee ball or tot soccer or baby basketball or whatever it&#39;s called. <br/>
<br/>
Money is what makes the world go &#39;round, right? Everyone does everything for money. The only reason people work is to get paid. If you do something for a living (like raising your own children) that doesn&#39;t come with a paycheck, your work is highly undervalued. I hate that on questionnaires there&#39;s no box for stay at home parent. It&#39;s homemaker these days because that&#39;s more politically correct than housewife. I don&#39;t make homes, though. If I did I&#39;d probably be either really rich or bankrupt right now. Ok, I&#39;m going off on all kinds of tangents so I&#39;ll shut up now.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Daniel Pink has some fantastic things to say about motivation. He&#39;s also done a TED Talk that I quite like: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation.html">http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation.html</a><br/>
<br/>
I did a blog post about motivation and learning, based on Peter Gray&#39;s blog, Alfie Kohn&#39;s work, and Dan Pink&#39;s TED Talk. Here&#39;s a blurb:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In a very recent TED Talk, Dan Pink talks about why we have it all wrong. This fits so well with Alfie Kohn&#39;s work, Punished by Rewards. Even though Pink is primarily talking about motivation in business settings, his ideas are definitely applicable to educational settings as well. He says that an extrinsic reward/punishment (carrot/stick) model is detrimental to motivation and that true motivation requires three intrinsic components: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. And he can quote the research that proves it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Giving a child money for goals may seem all about reward but punishment is automatically built in. A child who doesn&#39;t score doesn&#39;t get money. That&#39;s a punishment, regardless of the &quot;good intention&quot; of the parent offering the reward.<br/>
<br/>
Rewards for something like this takes away the intrinsic pleasure involved in sports and turns it into something quite different (and ups the pressure/stress) quite dramatically.<br/>

<br/>
I agree. However, it may still be more fun than mowing lawns :D<br/>
<br/>
I see this as a case of a parent&#39;s interest in soccer. The child&#39;s interest<br/>
may or may not be or may change. I don&#39;t think it would do much damage to<br/>
the child-soccer relationship. If the passion is there, it will remain,<br/>
otherwise, it will be lawn mowing - am able, will earn. I see more of a risk<br/>
to the parent-child relationship.<br/>
<br/>
At least in my life it panned out like that. Dad used to promise me money<br/>
for solving the crossword in the newspaper correctly. My relationship with<br/>
crosswords is pretty much the same, but I began realizing how much of the<br/>
appreciation I got was based on achievement. It was the relationship with<br/>
the father that started getting holes. I still enjoy crosswords and its ages<br/>
since they got me any money.<br/>
<br/>
of course, my experience may not be the only possibility, just that i don&#39;t<br/>
see what change would money bring to the enjoyment of soccer if it exists.<br/>

<br/>
If the coach discovered a parent was paying a child per goal and that  <br/>
was keeping the child from passing the ball...<br/>
<br/>
Marty does SCA armored combat.  He is generous with his opponents and  <br/>
gives them the benefit of the doubt.   This makes me a proud mom.  It  <br/>
frustrates the knight to whom Marty is squired, because he&#39;s trying to  <br/>
coach Marty to win.  All these years I&#39;ve been coaching Marty to be a  <br/>
nice guy.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily that other coach is my friend Jeff.  He understands.   There  <br/>
have been times Marty has courteously yielded a fight to a guy who was  <br/>
being a butt, though, and then LOTS of people are cranky at Marty for  <br/>
not standing up and winning.  But Marty is not a &quot;win at any cost&quot;  <br/>
kind of guy, and there&#39;s a fine line between claiming a victory over  <br/>
someone who&#39;s not being very honorable (and the crowd will go wild),  <br/>
and winning in a way that tips toward not being honorable himself (and  <br/>
the crowd goes quiet).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve watched my husband, Keith, in that sport for 30 years.  I&#39;ve had  <br/>
students who were tournament fighters.  I&#39;ve helped Keith with  <br/>
squires.  It&#39;s quite an involved sport and the repercussions last a  <br/>
long time.  Earlier this week Jeff and I were talking about an  <br/>
important  tournament Keith lost to his best friend (at that point  <br/>
becoming former best friend) who used a six-foot spear, in a  <br/>
tournament when sword and shield were expected.  Jeff, who hadn&#39;t even  <br/>
joined the club when that incident occurred, knew the details of the  <br/>
story.  It involved chivalry and dishonesty, and I was not sorry that  <br/>
Keith lost, even though it would have made me queen.  After that  <br/>
fight, Henry looked like a jerk, and Keith looked like an honorable guy.<br/>
<br/>
Nowhere in 30 years of SCA fighting could it ever, EVER have improved  <br/>
anything for someone to be offered money per blow or fall or victory.<br/>
<br/>
Because I know there are a few SCA participants in the readership  <br/>
here, the translation is<br/>
Marty:  Lord Bardolf Gunwaldtsson<br/>
Keith:  Jarl Gunwaldt Gulbjorn<br/>
Jeff:  Duke Artan MacAilin<br/>
the infamous spear-win:  Atenveldt Crown Tournament at Coronado  <br/>
Monument, fall 1979<br/>

<br/>
You drove off a cliff on that one.<br/>
<br/>
MANY people work at jobs they don&#39;t love because they want the money.   <br/>
Other people leave a well-paying job to do something because they love  <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
In studies in the 1970&#39;s on what motivates people to work, if people  <br/>
were giving situations in which there wasn&#39;t really anything  <br/>
productive to do but they still got paid, some were really unhappy.    <br/>
Some people at ANY job will take on more than they &quot;have to do,&quot; to  <br/>
keep store rooms organized or to bring muffins in or to decorate for  <br/>
Christmas.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you&#39;re defining work as something for which people are paid.  In  <br/>
that case my argument changes.  But I&#39;ve seen (and done) work for fun,  <br/>
work for community improvement, for friendship.<br/>
<br/>
Marty ran an orc ball game every Sunday for over a year because he  <br/>
wanted to.  It wasn&#39;t so organized that someone couldn&#39;t come and play  <br/>
who had never played before.  It wasn&#39;t so high-pressure that if  <br/>
someone didn&#39;t show up anyone was angry.  There weren&#39;t static teams.   <br/>
Except for a couple of times moms went and took photos, there&#39;s not  <br/>
even any evidence of it.  There were no spectators to speak of, no  <br/>
trophies, no records of wins or goals.  They played for the thrill of  <br/>
playing.<br/>
<br/>
Our friend Bo has basketball similarly in a park after dark.  Used to  <br/>
be one night a week and he would get ten guys if he was lucky.  Marty  <br/>
went recently. It&#39;s up to three times a week and there were 24 guys.<br/>
<br/>
Is that work or play?  Marty ALWAYS showed up with the boffers and the  <br/>
ball (a playground ball with a face and a wig; they went through half  <br/>
a dozen different balls).  Bo ALWAYS shows up with the basketball.<br/>

Soccer is a team sport.  It&#39;s not a crossword puzzle.<br/>
Soccer shouldn&#39;t involve the relationship between each player and his  <br/>
parents.<br/>
They should be working as a team and the parents should be letting the  <br/>
coach provide motivation.<br/>

<br/>
Why do Sandra, Pam, Schuyler, Alex, Meredith, I and so many others  <br/>
spend hours and hours each week answering questions without getting  <br/>
paid? Nobility only motivates so far ;-) It&#39;s fun. It&#39;s challenging.  <br/>
I&#39;m still challenged by the &quot;Why are you so mean?&quot; accusation to find  <br/>
a way to explain in a way the questioner will get it why it seems like  <br/>
that and why it needs to be as it is. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Money can create the impression of value and maybe that&#39;s what you&#39;re  <br/>
bemoaning. The work of a stay at home mother isn&#39;t seen as valuable as  <br/>
even a nanny ;-)<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m remembering the studies right, they judged people&#39;s perception  <br/>
of quality on the same product but in one part of the study it was  <br/>
free, in the other there was a small price. The one people had to pay  <br/>
for was perceived as having a higher quality.<br/>

youtube video and it is Daniel Pink! I say it again that this is a great book for anyone to read.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2112441391"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; -=-Money is what makes the world go &#39;round, right? Everyone does  <br/>
&gt; everything for money. The only reason people work is to get paid. -=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You drove off a cliff on that one.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; MANY people work at jobs they don&#39;t love because they want the money.   <br/>
&gt; Other people leave a well-paying job to do something because they love  <br/>
&gt; it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In studies in the 1970&#39;s on what motivates people to work, if people  <br/>
&gt; were giving situations in which there wasn&#39;t really anything  <br/>
&gt; productive to do but they still got paid, some were really unhappy.    <br/>
&gt; Some people at ANY job will take on more than they &quot;have to do,&quot; to  <br/>
&gt; keep store rooms organized or to bring muffins in or to decorate for  <br/>
&gt; Christmas.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe you&#39;re defining work as something for which people are paid.  In  <br/>
&gt; that case my argument changes.  But I&#39;ve seen (and done) work for fun,  <br/>
&gt; work for community improvement, for friendship.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, I was being sarcastic. I was thinking maybe that&#39;s what the parents who use money as a motivator in the way being discussed think. That&#39;s exactly the type of attitude I do not want to pass on to my kids. I want them to do things because they want to, they enjoy it, they think it&#39;s important or the right thing to do, not just because they are going to get paid.<br/>
<br/>
I think if you have to pay a child to make goals that they wouldn&#39;t make otherwise, the child probably isn&#39;t into the game that much. Seems to me that if the child really loved the game, he would play his best (which would mean scoring lots of goals is that was a skill) without needing any other motivator. Once you add money to the mix, even if the child does love the game, it changes the dynamics. Then it becomes about how much money the child can make rather than having fun and doing his best.<br/>
