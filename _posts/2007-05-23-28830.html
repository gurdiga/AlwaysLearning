<div id="ygrps-yiv-1734963823">Hello! I haven&#39;t posted much but have been reading alot. I just <br/>
wanted to write a thank you to all of you out there that are part of <br/>
this way of life and for contributing to those of us who are new to <br/>
the journey and need the support , encouragement and guidance.<br/>
We have been unschooling for about a year now with a few bumps in <br/>
the road. But I have to say we love it! My children are 6, 4, 2 and <br/>
8 months old and since we have let go of the old parenting mindsets <br/>
they have been so much more happier and loving. <br/>
What really helped us was reading the articles from joyfully <br/>
rejoicing. And really grasping the idea that we are partners in life <br/>
with our children. Also understanding how difficult and stressful it <br/>
is for a child that doesnt have many choices. We have changed the <br/>
way we see our children and realizing that they need us to give them <br/>
the information they need to understand things instead of forcing <br/>
them to comform to what we think is right. We have totally changed <br/>
the way we speak to them for ex: When my oldest takes a toy from the <br/>
toddler I used to bark at him to give it back and sometimes he would <br/>
get a time out. But now I just calmly let him know that taking other <br/>
peoples toys is rude and hurts their feelings. And he responds in <br/>
such a nicer more loving way, like he is understanding how his <br/>
actions affect others. He went from a very angry child who screamed <br/>
alot and hit to a loving, calm and gentle boy in what seemed <br/>
overnight.<br/>
So that is just some if the things that have been going on with us <br/>
lately.<br/>
And to answer that other question as to whether or not our children <br/>
take interest in anything, I can say that mine do. My oldest son is <br/>
very interested in everything science. Astronomy, engineering, <br/>
construction, rocketry, nature and carries around books studying it <br/>
on his own quite often.<br/>
My daughter loves art and spends alot of time drawing , painting and <br/>
coloring and helps me alot around the house, so I can say she is <br/>
interested in homemaking. She also shows interest in gardening and <br/>
composting. She pretty much follows me around all day wanting to be <br/>
involved in whatever I am doing-which I absolutely cherish.<br/>
My toddler is busy being a toddler and learning about the world <br/>
around him as is my baby.<br/>
I just wanted to say thank you-especially to Sandra Dodd, your <br/>
websites and articles have helped us tremendously. And we plan on <br/>
going to the Rethinking education conference so hopefully we will <br/>
see some of you there!<br/>
One Love-Tna</div>
