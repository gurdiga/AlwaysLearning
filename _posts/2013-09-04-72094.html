<div id="ygrps-yiv-203106014">Wondering what words of wisdom you wonderful people might have for me about my 2 boys ages 12 and 9.

However, they are getting much, much less physical activity. So when they get off the computers, they both act like crazy animals. They scream, run, yell, push, wrestle, tickle non stop. They drive each other, plus my husband and I nuts when they act like that. They are truly unable to control themselves often in public because they are more or less hyperactive. Again this is something that is new for us, only happening in the last year since their computer usage has ramped up. Previously, we would talk about social graces and what seemed appropriate and they would be fine with it. Now they run through stores, crash into people, fling their bodies about, etc unable to stop even when we point out how inappropriate their behavior is.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1052406315">You&#39;ve been on this discussion for less than a month, so I&#39;m going to guess that before now you were getting your unschooling advice and ideas elsewhere.   I hope you get lots of feedback, but I want to suggest a couple of things that will help you clarify your thinking about unschooling, and help you see where others here might be coming from with their responses.<br/>
<br/>

&quot;In control&quot; is a problem.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/control">http://sandradodd.com/control</a><br/>
This will help you immensely, too, I think: <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-441662600">There are many different desk configurations that allow people to be more active while using computers.Here are a few examples off the top of my head: a standing desk, a swiss ball instead of a chair, a regular chair with a foot bike, I&#39;ve even seen someone with a treadmill set up in front of a standing desk.&nbsp;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-907378230"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;However, they are getting much, much less physical activity. So when they get off the computers, they both act like crazy animals.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Have you ever seen artists working in a group studio space?  When they are really excited about what they are doing, they can act like &quot;crazy animals&quot;.  Football players after an exciting game can look a lot like crazy animals.  People dancing to their favourite song can really look like crazy animals.  Rather than see it as a product of something negative, try looking at it from a different angle.  How do you *know* that it&#39;s because they are less physically active, that they jump around?  Couldn&#39;t it be because they are more excited?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They scream, run, yell, push, wrestle, tickle non stop.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nearly every day, several times a day, for a few months Ethan would ask me to tickle, which really meant gentle wrestling.  We would climb on the biggest bed and tickle, wrestle, laugh, and yell for a good long period of time.  I didn&#39;t know what that was about for Ethan, but I agreed to engage with him because it seemed to be something that he needed to do.  Interestingly, shortly after our wrestling period waned, he began to ask the most deep and intriguing questions.  So began what I called our mental wrestling period!  ;-)  Who knows?  Maybe one activity lead to another.  Maybe not.  But, for sure, it all seemed very meaningful and helpful to Ethan.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They drive each other, plus my husband and I nuts when they act like that.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ethan and I have a rule when we get crazy.  When one person is done, we&#39;re done for now.  It&#39;s usually me who is done first, but not always.  Sometimes there&#39;s a disappointed &quot;Awww!&quot;  But, Ethan knows we&#39;re not done forever, so he seems to understand.  Make room for the fun kind of craziness in your lives.  <br/>
<br/>
Last night Ethan and I were watching tv.  He seemed a bit blue...maybe bored, so I said, &quot;Wanna tickle?&quot;  He said he didn&#39;t feel like it.  Then I noticed that he seemed to perk up a bit after.  Maybe it was just that thought that helped.  Again, I don&#39;t know for sure.  But being open to whimsy and generous in judgement has proven to be a very useful tool in my relationship Ethan. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They are truly unable to control themselves often in public because they are more or less hyperactive.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Before you take them into a crowd, maybe give some extra time to take them to a park to run around.  Play tag with them.  Let them get the sillies out before you engage with others.  Then, *before* you go in public, remind them that people don&#39;t like to be banged around and probably don&#39;t like yelling.  Ask them to respect others.  Don&#39;t give a long speech.  Maybe say, &quot;When we go inside, don&#39;t run around and yell.  People don&#39;t like that.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So, I guess I&#39;m wondering what ideas, thoughts, comments some of you might have.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In our home, there is a small trampoline behind Ethan&#39;s desk.  When he gets up he hops for a bit, then usually runs or skips to wherever he&#39;s headed.  Often he stops at the kitchen door to jump and swing from the pull-up bar.  Outside, we have a larger trampoline, that hasn&#39;t been seeing much use lately.  Ethan has been favouring the slack lines I put up between the trees of our front yard.  In the living room, we have a piece of exercise equipment.  Sometimes the kids run on that while watching tv.  My husband and I do that too.  <br/>
<br/>
These are some of the options in our home.  They change as we change.  We all like to be somewhat physically active, so these things keep it interesting for us when we don&#39;t feel like going outside.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;We have always as a family discussed what seems appropriate and previously when it was pointed out that they didn&#39;t respond well in life to too much computer time, they self regulated, but that doesn&#39;t seem to be happening now.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Did they really &quot;self regulate&quot;, or were they responding to your fears?  <br/>
<br/>
What is &quot;self regulate&quot; anyway?  What does it look like?  <br/>
<br/>
A couple months ago I discovered a new series of fluffy fiction books that I had never read before.  In one month I read probably more than 20 of these books!  I stayed up waaaaay to late reading.  I carried my ipad around with me everywhere, sneaking in sentences whenever I could get away with it.  I was perpetually tired.  It was new and I was captivated!  I&#39;ve moved on, but I wouldn&#39;t say I self regulated.  Would it have been better if I had allotted myself only one book a week?  Would it have been worse if I had kept on reading so voraciously?  Is sitting and reading for hours on end more desirable than sitting at the computer?  Is standing and painting better? <br/>
<br/>
Some questions to ponder.  Reflecting on these things helped me come to a deeper appreciation of my son&#39;s own interests.  It also helped me more clearly understand and support how he learns best.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1080360915">I found a quote that seemed useful for this topic:  <br/>
<br/>
-------<br/>
New Trust and far-reaching effects<br/>
<br/>
I finally let go of my control issue around TV and video. In its place I found trust which created a deepening of love and respect in my relationship with my son and my family and everything else in my life. It is amazing how far reaching the effect was. Just wanted to share this.  —Dede<br/>

When I read the original post it seemed the mom wasn&#39;t participating with the boys and wasn&#39;t really sure what they were doing on the computer, so being cranky about them being on the computer, she was blaming it for other things.  Seems more to be a disconnect, a lack of partnership.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1304205329"><p>I have also been unchooling for my son&#39;s entire life. He has never attended school.</p><p><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">My son is 13 and adores video games. He games all day. He intends on becoming a video game programmer. So, I understand where your children are coming from.</p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">It sounds to me that your sons are doing great. Sometimes we have mind blocks when it comes to our children. My husband has had this same concern. Our son went from playing with toys, watching tv, running around everywhere to closing his door and gaming all day. (Around 12 years old). &nbsp;My was very upset about the amount of computer time our son enjoyed. He wanted us to make him exercise. He wanted limits. I simply didn&#39;t agree and saw no need for any of this. I&#39;ve never viewed the computer time as an issue. My son is loving, charming, caring, kind and a wonderful kid. He just chooses to immerse himself in video games. That&#39;s his choice and I support him. So, I reasoned that we should not act hastily and wait and see what happened. &nbsp;My husband has seen over time that the video game and computer usage hasn&#39;t changed our son. He&#39;s not morphed into someone different.We used the wait and see, watch and listen technique and my husband saw for himself that his desire for control and limits was unnecessary.&nbsp;</p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span style="background-color:transparent;line-height:1.22;"><br></span></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span style="background-color:transparent;line-height:1.22;">You say that your sons do enjoy physical activity and state that they do many different things aside from the games. Sounds good to me.</span></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span style="background-color:transparent;line-height:1.22;"><br></span></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span style="background-color:transparent;line-height:1.22;">The activity they exhibit in public sounds normal to me as well. They are expressing themselves and being kids. Screaming, running, yelling and wrestling with one another sounds great! How fun!&nbsp;</span></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span style="background-color:transparent;line-height:1.22;"><br></span></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span style="background-color:transparent;line-height:1.22;">Do you think their behaviors are changing due to age and not game usage, but you are placing the blame on game usage?</span></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span style="background-color:transparent;line-height:1.22;"><br></span></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">I see my job as a parent is to get my son from point A (birth) to point B (adulthood and beyond). If my son is happy and healthy I&#39;m doing my job.&nbsp;</p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">Without talking about control or limits, you could talk to your sons about doing things out of the house more. Ask them if they&#39;d like to visit a new museum or a new park. Have a conversation about their games, ask them to talk about what&#39;s been happening in them. I engage my son in great, lengthy conversations about his gaming. I might not fully understand what he&#39;s doing in the games, but he loves talking to me about them. This is a fun activity that does get him out of his room and that he enjoys greatly.&nbsp;</p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">Remember to relax, watch, listen, and take a deep breath. By allowing your children the freedoms of unschooling, you are fostering their long term health and happiness.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-289825805"><p>Not sure where anyone got the idea that we don&#39;t have a good relationship, that I expect grown up behavior or why anyone thinks I don&#39;t know or don&#39;t participate in their online activities.

I just want them to find a balance for themselves in their physical activity, like they have for the past 9 and almost 13 years, which seems to be missing now.</p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:12.727272033691406px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:12.727272033691406px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">We have been unschooling for about 8 years and I did get info elsewhere because when I first joined this board 7-8 years ago I felt that people immediately spoke to me as if they all knew my life, my children, my ideals, my relationship with my kids better than I knew those things myself so I quickly got off the list. Unfortunately, it seems things haven&#39;t changed. One person mentioned a few ideas about an indoor trampoline, etc....thank you.</p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:12.727272033691406px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:12.727272033691406px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">Interestingly, just yesterday at the end of the day my almost 13 year old said to me, &quot;I didn&#39;t go online today at all because I think I want to experiment with trying less computer use. It makes me feel all out of control and like I can&#39;t stand myself when I do.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:12.727272033691406px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:12.727272033691406px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">So though I was never worried about it and have always had a strong belief in my kids, I just thought there might be some suggestions that might help.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-656860938"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When I read the original post it seemed the mom wasn&#39;t participating with the boys and wasn&#39;t really sure what they were doing on the computer, so being cranky about them being on the computer, she was blaming it for other things.  Seems more to be a disconnect, a lack of partnership.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Many nights after my husband comes home from work, he asks me to play Starcraft with him.  I&#39;m not very good at it.  For those of you who know about games, my APM (actions per minute) are around 14.  My husband&#39;s are in the hundreds.  I&#39;m slow and pokey...and precise.  ;-)  It isn&#39;t because I&#39;m good that he likes me to play.  It&#39;s because he wants to connect.  Share something.  Be on his team.  I love it actually - the connecting, the sharing, the team.  I think the game is okay.<br/>
<br/>
The same goes with my son.  Just today, we played some games on the computer.  Then he asked me to come outside on the slack line with him.  Now he is playing and I am writing beside him.  Later he is excited to go to a graphics party through Doug&#39;s work.  This weekend we might do something I like to do.  <br/>
<br/>
Just two days ago, Ethan and I were balancing on the slack line together.  He jumped down and said, &quot;Do you know what I like about being here so much?&quot;  I assumed he meant being outside on the slack line.  I said, &quot;No.  What?&quot;  He said, &quot;That you and dad love me so much.&quot;  Then I understood that &quot;being here&quot; meant being alive.  How great is that!?  What a gift we have given him.  It&#39;s so humbling.  <br/>
<br/>
That love of life will take him far, whatever he chooses to do.  I hope he always knows it.  <br/>

<br/>
People aren&#39;t speaking to you, though.  They&#39;re speaking to the statements made, for the benefit of ALL the readers.  This discussion has been that way, and described that way, for nearly 12 years.    (I&#39;ll put a note below to a great explanation of that, by Joyce, written over 8 years ago, I&#39;m pretty sure.)<br/>
<br/>
Here are some other ideas about physical activities:<br/>

<br/>
If something changed recently, and you&#39;ve recently let them be online more, they will need to recover from the binge that results from restrictions being lifted.  That&#39;s caused by the former restrictions, not by the current activity.  It will settle out.<br/>

-=-Not sure where anyone got the idea that we don&#39;t have a good relationship, that I expect grown up behavior or why anyone thinks I don&#39;t know or don&#39;t participate in their online activities.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Phrases you used and conditions you described could, in a family, indicate that.  If it doesn&#39;t in yours, no problem.  If it does, fine, but there are others here who will look at all the comments and hold them up to their own situations and questions.   it&#39;s not a help desk, it&#39;s a discussion of ideas.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I think the important part in my original post that seems to have been missed is that this is totally new, radically different  behavior that they both started to exhibit shortly after starting to spend so much time online.-=-<br/>
<br/>
People often reveal information they didn&#39;t intend to, and that&#39;s sometimes what commenters pick up on.  People who offer assistance for free can do it the way they want to, and here&#39;s how Joyce has described the workings of this discussion:<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
The list is about ideas, not about people.<br/>
Think of ideas like balls and the list like a ball court. If someone tosses an idea worth discussing into the court it&#39;s going to get batted about. At that point what&#39;s going on is no longer about the person who tossed the idea in. It&#39;s about the idea and how well and cleanly it&#39;s being tossed about. (Unless the tosser keeps jumping in and grabbing the idea ball saying &quot;Mine!&quot;)<br/>

line-height:15.852272033691406px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">What if that&#39;s not the reason? After all, they&#39;re still getting a lot of physical activity, so it really doesn&#39;t seem likely that&#39;s such a big deal. So what other factors could be coming into play? It could be that what they&#39;re doing is getting them very excited! Movies, games, social interactions... all those things can be really stimulating. My daughter often gets off the computer all excited about something and then will go and run around, or jump on the trampoline, or talk (and she&#39;s not a talker so sudden bursts of conversation are somewhat startling!). Do your guys have a chance to do something like that? Run around or chatter enthusiastically? Play out some of what they&#39;ve read or seen or discussed? If they&#39;re getting off the computer for a dull car ride to a boring old grocery store, then it makes sense that they seem a bit overstimulated - they haven&#39;t had a chance to process all
 that excitement, share their joys, or work off a bit of steam yet.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="color:rgb(69, 69, 69);background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:16.363636016845703px;"><span style="color:rgb(69, 69, 69);line-height:15.852272033691406px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></div><div style="color:rgb(69, 69, 69);background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:16.363636016845703px;"><span style="color:rgb(69, 69, 69);line-height:15.852272033691406px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Rather than bemoaning their excess energy, anticipate it. Be prepared for them to need some time rather than expecting them to go right from the computer to something else.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-376451995"><p>Sigh.....thanks all for taking the time to share your thoughts and ideas. Unfortunately, none of them seem to pertain to me, my kids or our situation at all. I really appreciate that this is a list for bouncing ideas, so bounce away. The following paragraph is addressed to me, as witnessed by the use of &quot;you,&quot; &nbsp;as were most of the others. So I&#39;m confused as to why it would be stated that they are not addressed to me...</p><p><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.333333969116211px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:rgb(69, 69, 69);font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:15.555556297302246px;line-height:22.22222328186035px;">If you&#39;re not seeing that and valuing those parts of their lives, they&#39;ll be less likely to share those parts of their lives... and that in turn could be a reason for being a little &quot;wild&quot; - they&#39;re stressed by the thought of your disapproval or lack of understanding. People tend to make poorer decisions under stress. Don&#39;t set them up to make poorer decisions if you can help it! Get more involved with those other parts of their lives so they can feel like &nbsp;you&#39;re an ally rather than some kind of gatekeeper.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.333333969116211px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.333333969116211px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">I am very, very involved in my kids activities, online and otherwise and don&#39;t &quot;disapprove&quot; of anything. I&#39;m only concerned about the extremely different behavior they are exhibiting, that came about due to no changes about lifting restrictions. Computer usage wasn&#39;t restricted before and now isn&#39;t. You can&#39;t possibly be suggesting that I should never be concerned or that if I am I surely must disapprove, right? Once again, not sure what post it is that others are responding to, but people seem to like to add a lot to my post (maybe it is projection about your own lives, rather than mine.) I think you&#39;re right, Sandra, people are reading between the lines of my post reading all kinds of random things that do not reflect our situation remotely. Maybe I didn&#39;t word the original very well because I typed it in a flash and never even re-read it before sending, but there are some rather amusing assumptions that have been made here!</p><p><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.333333969116211px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">I&#39;m glad others are getting something out of all of your bouncing of ideas, I wish some of it pertained to our situation. Since I posted the original query, I just assumed people would be responding to me and my query. I guess I shouldn&#39;t have made that assumption. Fortunately, since my last post, I have received many private messages of support, giving me constructive ideas without making assumptions about how our family functions or what our relationship is really like.</p><p><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.333333969116211px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">charlene</p> <div class="ygrps-yiv-376451995ygroups-quoted"><br><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> --- In alwayslearning@yahoogroups.com, &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt; wrote:<br><br><div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);font-family:'times new roman', 'new york', times, serif;font-size:12pt;"><div style="font-family:'times new roman', 'new york', times, serif;font-size:12pt;"><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span style="color:rgb(69, 69, 69);font-family:Georgia;font-size:12.727272033691406px;">they are getting much, much less physical activity. So when they get off the computers, they both act like crazy animals.&lt;&lt;</span></div><div style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:12.727272033691406px;color:rgb(69, 69, 69);background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span style="color:rgb(69, 69, 69);font-family:Georgia;font-size:12.727272033691406px;"><br></span></div><div style="color:rgb(69, 69, 69);background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;font-family:Georgia;"><span style="color:rgb(69, 69, 69);font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">What if that&#39;s not the reason? After all, they&#39;re still getting a lot of physical activity, so it really doesn&#39;t seem likely that&#39;s such a big deal. So what other factors could be coming into play? It could be that what they&#39;re doing is getting them very excited! Movies, games, social interactions... all those things can be really stimulating. My daughter often gets off the computer all excited about something and then will go and run around, or jump on the trampoline, or talk (and she&#39;s not a talker so sudden bursts of conversation are somewhat startling!). Do your guys have a chance to do something like that? Run around or chatter enthusiastically? Play out some of what they&#39;ve read or seen or discussed? If they&#39;re getting off the computer for a dull car ride to a boring old grocery store, then it makes sense that they seem a bit overstimulated - they haven&#39;t had a chance to process all
 that excitement, share their joys, or work off a bit of steam yet.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="color:rgb(69, 69, 69);background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:16.363636016845703px;"><span style="color:rgb(69, 69, 69);font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></div><div style="color:rgb(69, 69, 69);background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:16.363636016845703px;"><span style="color:rgb(69, 69, 69);font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Rather than bemoaning their excess energy, anticipate it. Be prepared for them to need some time rather than expecting them to go right from the computer to something else. Be there to ask questions, or offer to do something active and fun right away - &quot;hey, you&#39;re off the internet? Lets go for a bike
 ride and you can tell me about that game you were playing, it looked really cool.&quot;</span></div><div style="color:rgb(69, 69, 69);background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span style="color:rgb(69, 69, 69);font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></div><div style="color:rgb(69, 69, 69);background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;font-size:16.363636016845703px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="color:rgb(69, 69, 69);font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">&gt;&gt;</span><span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:12.727272033691406px;">When they were little they used the computers very little and I felt good about that.</span></div><div style="color:rgb(69, 69, 69);background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;font-size:12.727272033691406px;font-family:Georgia;"><span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:12.727272033691406px;">&gt;&gt;</span><span style="">I&#39;m okay with that because they are able to still engage with us and aren&#39;t like zombies in front of the screen</span></div><div style="color:rgb(69, 69, 69);background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;font-size:12.727272033691406px;font-family:Georgia;"><span style=""><br></span></div><div style="color:rgb(69, 69, 69);background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">I pulled those two lines out because they both show that you have a definite bias around this topic - that&#39;s a problem.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1095097793">&lt;&lt;<br/>
I am very, very involved in my kids activities, online and<br/>
otherwise and don&#39;t &quot;disapprove&quot; of anything. I&#39;m only concerned<br/>
about the extremely different behavior they are exhibiting, that<br/>
came about due to no changes about lifting restrictions. Computer<br/>
usage wasn&#39;t restricted before and now isn&#39;t. You can&#39;t possibly<br/>
be suggesting that I should never be concerned or that if I am I<br/>
surely must disapprove, right?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You mentioned that you have feelings about computer usage- you &#39;felt good&#39; when they didn&#39;t use it a lot, when younger, and now you are seeing a correlation between increased usage and &#39;crazy&#39; behavior.  You also mentioned that they aren&#39;t &#39;zombie&#39; like about the computer-- that statement suggests that you DO have a threshold of comfort around computer usage, and they are exceeding it.  You are concerned about a perceived link between too much computer, not enough exercise (though you gave a pretty extensive list of physical activities they are involved in-- maybe they need *more* computer or down time and the wild behavior is from being overcommitted or overstimulated).<br/>
<br/>
You also mentioned that you have &#39;pointed out&#39; in the past how too much computer use had some sort of negative impact, and they were able to &#39;self-regulate&#39; based on that feedback.  Please read the links about control and self-regulation.  Maybe at the time, using the computer wasn&#39;t as important to them as knowing mom felt good about what they were doing.<br/>
<br/>
  You have said you&#39;ve never restricted their computer use, but I doubt that they havent picked up on your discomfort with what you seem to consider excessive-- a group of total strangers has done so.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps they are reacting to your concern.  They&#39;ve gotten really IN to what they&#39;re doing, and are on the computer more than you are comfortable with (whether you directly say it or not) and now they are SO interested in it, it trumps doing what mom is comfortable with-- maybe they feel uncomfortable or negative about themselves and with what they want-- that creates stress.  Stress can make people act &#39;crazy.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
If you are feeling attacked and misunderstood, it&#39;s pretty likely there is something about the situation you are unwilling to see.<br/>
<br/>
But I bet it would help your kids a LOT if you were able to find some other way to think about this than as a problem: &quot;too much computer is making them crazy.&quot;  A different way of looking at it is what people here have been trying to offer you, and everyone else reading.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1331861763"><p>++++++Why are those people NOT posting helpful ideas to the group!???? 
Really?? If anyone has helpful ideas they could be helping so many other
 people in this group! ++++++</p><p><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">To answer this question, I think I might understand. I think I began to understand the nature of this group when several months ago it was described as(I&#39;m paraphrasing here)&nbsp; a dojo mat-- here people get in to &quot;play&quot; and toss around &quot;radical unschooling&quot; ideas. Like martial arts. It&#39;s very much enjoyed by the participants...&nbsp; To those of us on the &quot;outside&quot; it seems like there are only a handful who are strong enough to &quot;compete,&quot; and be respected by the really good players.&nbsp; Yet we can still watch and learn from them. <br><br>Some of us watch and see a new person jump in and then get hammered by the &quot;advanced players&quot;-- but feel we might have something valuable to say, but don&#39;t want to get &quot;the moves put on us&quot; in the same way, so we might contact the newer commenter off list. Some might have a slightly different view of unschooling, and want to offer their viewpoint, without having&nbsp; it scrutinized over here. But I certainly understand why people would contact questioners off list. (I haven&#39;t done it much myself honestly, maybe a couple times? at most) It&#39;s an intense environment to post. It&#39;s valuable to read, valuable to see when a new person posts too; there are the top players here, but not everyone who reads is ready&nbsp; or wants to compete at the radical unschooling martial arts olympics.&nbsp; : )<br></p> <div class="ygrps-yiv-1331861763ygroups-quoted" style="display:block;"><br>Most of the times I&#39;ve posted to this list, I&#39;ve gotten really nervous-- waiting for the attack to come. And I have pretty thick skin. So in answer to that question-- I think that is why some people with ideas don&#39;t post here. If people want to start &quot;sparring&quot; it feels easier and safer to try it over at the facebook group. <br><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> --- In alwayslearning@yahoogroups.com, &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt; wrote:<br><br><div><div style="color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"><div><span style="background-color:transparent;">&gt;&gt;</span><span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:12.727272033691406px;background-color:transparent;color:rgb(69, 69, 69);">Sigh.....thanks all for taking the time to share your thoughts and ideas.

    <div id="ygrps-yiv-930314097ygrp-text">


      <p></p><p>Sigh.....thanks all for taking the time to share your thoughts and ideas. Unfortunately, none of them seem to pertain to me, my kids or our situation at all. I really appreciate that this is a list for bouncing ideas, so bounce away. The following paragraph is addressed to me, as witnessed by the use of &quot;you,&quot; &nbsp;as were most of the others. So I&#39;m confused as to why it would be stated that they are not addressed to me...</p><p><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.333333969116211px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:rgb(69, 69, 69);font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:15.555556297302246px;">If you&#39;re not seeing that and valuing those parts of their lives, they&#39;ll be less likely to share those parts of their lives... and that in turn could be a reason for being a little &quot;wild&quot; - they&#39;re stressed by the thought of your disapproval or lack of understanding. People tend to make poorer decisions under stress. Don&#39;t set them up to make poorer decisions if you can help it! Get more involved with those other parts of their lives so they can feel like &nbsp;you&#39;re an ally rather than some kind of gatekeeper.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.333333969116211px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.333333969116211px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">I am very, very involved in my kids activities, online and otherwise and don&#39;t &quot;disapprove&quot; of anything. I&#39;m only concerned about the extremely different behavior they are exhibiting, that came about due to no changes about lifting restrictions. Computer usage wasn&#39;t restricted before and now isn&#39;t. You can&#39;t possibly be suggesting that I should never be concerned or that if I am I surely must disapprove, right? Once again, not sure what post it is that others are responding to, but people seem to like to add a lot to my post (maybe it is projection about your own lives, rather than mine.) I think you&#39;re right, Sandra, people are reading between the lines of my post reading all kinds of random things that do not reflect our situation remotely. Maybe I didn&#39;t word the original very well because I typed it in a flash and never even re-read it before sending, but there are some rather amusing assumptions that have been made here!</p><p><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.333333969116211px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">I&#39;m glad others are getting something out of all of your bouncing of ideas, I wish some of it pertained to our situation. Since I posted the original query, I just assumed people would be responding to me and my query. I guess I shouldn&#39;t have made that assumption. Fortunately, since my last post, I have received many private messages of support, giving me constructive ideas without making assumptions about how our family functions or what our relationship is really like.</p><p><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.333333969116211px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">charlene</p> <div class="ygrps-yiv-930314097ygroups-quoted"><br><br>--- In <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:alwayslearning@yahoogroups.com">alwayslearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt; wrote:<br><br><div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);font-family:'times new roman', 'new york', times, serif;font-size:12pt;"><div style="font-family:'times new roman', 'new york', times, serif;font-size:12pt;"><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span style="color:rgb(69, 69, 69);font-family:Georgia;font-size:12.727272033691406px;">they are getting much, much less physical activity. So when they get off the computers, they both act like crazy animals.&lt;&lt;</span></div><div style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:12.727272033691406px;color:rgb(69, 69, 69);background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span style="color:rgb(69, 69, 69);font-family:Georgia;font-size:12.727272033691406px;"><br></span></div><div style="color:rgb(69, 69, 69);background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;font-family:Georgia;"><span style="color:rgb(69, 69, 69);font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">What if that&#39;s not the reason? After all, they&#39;re still getting a lot of physical activity, so it really doesn&#39;t seem likely that&#39;s such a big deal. So what other factors could be coming into play? It could be that what they&#39;re doing is getting them very excited! Movies, games, social interactions... all those things can be really stimulating. My daughter often gets off the computer all excited about something and then will go and run around, or jump on the trampoline, or talk (and she&#39;s not a talker so sudden bursts of conversation are somewhat startling!). Do your guys have a chance to do something like that? Run around or chatter enthusiastically? Play out some of what they&#39;ve read or seen or discussed? If they&#39;re getting off the computer for a dull car ride to a boring old grocery store, then it makes sense that they seem a bit overstimulated - they haven&#39;t had a chance to process all
 that excitement, share their joys, or work off a bit of steam yet.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="color:rgb(69, 69, 69);background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:16.363636016845703px;"><span style="color:rgb(69, 69, 69);font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></div><div style="color:rgb(69, 69, 69);background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:16.363636016845703px;"><span style="color:rgb(69, 69, 69);font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Rather than bemoaning their excess energy, anticipate it. Be prepared for them to need some time rather than expecting them to go right from the computer to something else. Be there to ask questions, or offer to do something active and fun right away - &quot;hey, you&#39;re off the internet? Lets go for a bike
 ride and you can tell me about that game you were playing, it looked really cool.&quot;</span></div><div style="color:rgb(69, 69, 69);background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span style="color:rgb(69, 69, 69);font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></div><div style="color:rgb(69, 69, 69);background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;font-size:16.363636016845703px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="color:rgb(69, 69, 69);font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">&gt;&gt;</span><span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:12.727272033691406px;">When they were little they used the computers very little and I felt good about that.</span></div><div style="color:rgb(69, 69, 69);background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;font-size:12.727272033691406px;font-family:Georgia;"><span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:12.727272033691406px;">&gt;&gt;</span><span>I&#39;m okay with that because they are able to still engage with us and aren&#39;t like zombies in front of the screen</span></div><div style="color:rgb(69, 69, 69);background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;font-size:12.727272033691406px;font-family:Georgia;"><span><br></span></div><div style="color:rgb(69, 69, 69);background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">I pulled those two lines out because they both show that you have a definite bias around this topic - that&#39;s a problem. I&#39;m going to rephrase them with a different kind of bias to highlight that: &quot;when she was little my daughter eschewed team sports and I felt good about that&quot; and &quot;I&#39;m okay
 with her playing croquet because she is still able to engage with me and hasn&#39;t been subsumed by a team.&quot; It&#39;s possible to have biases like that about anything - for some parents its books, or socializing (wanting to be like other kids - that&#39;s a hard one for some parents). As long as you have that kind of bias, it&#39;s going to effect your assumptions about causes and effects. That&#39;s why it&#39;s so important to step back and say &quot;what if I&#39;m wrong? What Other reasons might there be for what I&#39;m seeing?&quot; Don&#39;t trust your &quot;gut&quot; about this, think it through.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></div><div></div><div><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp;&gt;&gt;</span><span style="color:rgb(69, 69, 69);font-family:Georgia;font-size:12.727272033691406px;">when it was pointed out that
 they didn&#39;t respond well in life to too much computer time...&lt;&lt;</span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(69, 69, 69);font-family:Georgia;font-size:12.727272033691406px;"><br></span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(69, 69, 69);font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The time they&#39;re spending reading, watching videos, playing games, and socializing is all part of their life, regardless of whether or not those things involve a computer.

It can be hard but it really pays off because my intent is not to be * right*, it is to learn and do better, it is to understand why , all the reasons that idea or the words I am using &nbsp;can help me or not to create this wonderful learning environment for my children to learn and to be &nbsp;the partner, mother and wife I want to be.</div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:19px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">No &nbsp;one is defeated here!

IF someone says use eggs that will be discussed! Sending that on the side I am not sure is what the other person wants if
 they are here asking for help. It maybe undermining them.</div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:19px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">I honestly would not appreciate that kind of advice if I was here looking to keep my recipes vegan.</div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:19px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:19px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></div><div></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><font face="courier">Alex Polikowsky ( English is not my first language but I still post here because I learn &nbsp;and my ideas get clearer and it helps me be a better mom)</font></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><a rel="nofollow"

<div id="ygrps-yiv-940153396"><p dir="ltr">I&#39;ve sat and pondered statements for months before it has finally gotten through to me. For me, to the point statements is what I&#39;ve needed for change. And sometimes my ego needs the hit. This is not the easy road, not for me anyway. It&#39;s taking thought, critique, and a lot of watching and reading, I mean a lot. Misguided ideas that get attacked, help me because I may have agreed with the misadvice, and see things clearer when the idea is attacked. I&#39;m grateful to have more experienced people give honest, forward thought. (But I&#39;ve grown to this point, I did once try to leave the group :) really glad I didn&#39;t)</p>
