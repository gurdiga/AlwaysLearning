<div id="ygrps-yiv-888071486">I had forgotten about these people but now it came up on my facebook &quot;recent posts&quot; thing....   Indigo children.  Gack.  <br/>
Here&#39;s someone&#39;s description of it.<br/>
<br/>
=============================================<br/>
Have strong self esteem, connection to source<br/>
Have an obvious sense of self<br/>
Refuse to follow orders or directions<br/>
Get bored rather easily with assigned tasks<br/>
Are rather creative<br/>
Display strong intuition<br/>
Have strong empathy for others or NO empathy<br/>
Develop abstract thinking very young<br/>
Are gifted and/or talented, highly intelligent<br/>
Are often identified or suspected of having ADHD<br/>
Are frequent daydreamers<br/>
Have very old, deep, wise looking eyes<br/>
Have spiritual intelligence and/or psychic skills&quot; <br/>
<br/>
My home is a total haven for the indigo child. Maybe that&#39;s how I got so many of them to choose me for a mother. And exactly when did these children become prominent on the planet??? I have just about all of those characteristics!!!!<br/>
=============================================<br/>
<br/>
I thought it would go away.  I think aliens are going to come and take them all somewhere cool at some point, too, or they&#39;re going to take over the earth or both.   But the main thing is not the kids.  The main thing is that their MOTHERS are so darned special.  They have been entrusted with some sort of superior being, due to their superior mothering abilities!<br/>
<br/>
If anyone here is tempted to believe or care about those things, here:  Unschooling works the same with all children.  Sorting children into gifted or not, ADHD or not, bored easily or not.... all of that harms the child, the parents&#39; relationship with the child, and harms the environment of natural learning.  That&#39;s all.  Be crazy if you want to be, but don&#39;t treat one of your children differently than the others that way, and don&#39;t expect me or anyone else to treat your child as a rarified alien gift to mankind.  Help him learn to live in such a way that he doesn&#39;t need to say &quot;You have to be nice to me, though; I&#39;m an Indigo child!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Some of the responses to that posting were people who are not even my very-indirect, so-called &quot;friends&quot; (facebook not-even-acquaintances).  I don&#39;t mind having facebook friends I don&#39;t know.  I don&#39;t much like to have my tons of friends exposed to any lunacy about indigo rude/bored/no-empathy (or empathy)/daydreaming/psychic kids.  These &quot;friends&quot; of &quot;friends&quot; have gone off the deep end of the deep end.<br/>
<br/>
One wrote:  &quot;I forget im &quot;indigo&quot; as well. I should stamp my statuses as well with proclamation of indigo authority hehehe&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So... it&#39;s something someone can forget.   Not very gifted.<br/>
<br/>
Another muddied the deep-end waters with this:  &quot;the time line of when indigos, crystals, rainbows was born are not absolute to the dates that everyone says. my 19 yr old and my 10 yr old are indigos. my 7 yr old is crystal. my mom and grandmom are rainbow. lol. lol..&quot;<br/>
<br/>
LOL?  How can having an overlay of crystalline bullshit be funny?  (Okay, it&#39;s kind of amusing, but I&#39;m still going to unfriend anyone who straight-facedly writes about indigo children.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-455936334">***I had forgotten about these people but now it came up on my facebook &quot;recent posts&quot; thing.... Indigo children. Gack. ***<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The last time I was reminded of indigo children, it was a much older sister referring to her much younger brother and one of his friends.  Here&#39;s the thing about those 2 kids, the younger brother is so damaged by his parent&#39;s psychosis that he can&#39;t maintain healthy relationships or function in any normal sort of way.  Is he an indigo child because he&#39;s different, or is he different because he&#39;s been abused and neglected his entire life?  The other kid is living with me because she refuses to live with her own parents.  She&#39;s full of baggage from all the damage that she&#39;s experienced in her life.  Does that make her special?<br/>
<br/>
Both of those kids are unique and interesting kids.  Both of them have sustained heavy damage and don&#39;t operate at their greatest potential.  Sometimes kids that don&#39;t encounter great amounts of dysfunction, don&#39;t stand out right away because they don&#39;t need to.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve wondered for a long time if the &quot;indigo children&quot; aren&#39;t just kids that have sustained damage, or that their parents have and are projecting it onto their kids.<br/>
<br/>
The list reframed in that light:<br/>
<br/>
***Have strong self esteem, connection to source<br/>

<br/>
Have a strong sense of how to appear in a way that makes them appear strong and connected<br/>
Are very self absorbed<br/>
Refuse to follow orders or directions because they live in reactionary mode<br/>
Get bored easily because they&#39;ve never connected with anything and are always running<br/>
Are creative because they need to be to survive<br/>
Display strong ideas and assumptions about things based on their own dysfunctional frame of reference<br/>
Have strong empathy or NO empathy depending on how it will serve to help them<br/>
Develop abstract thinking very young, just like lots of other kids, but never fully develop it functionally<br/>
Are gifted and or talented, highly intelligent just like everyone else<br/>
Are often diagnosed with things like ADHD because their parents are looking for ways to fix their kids<br/>
Are frequent daydreamers because their lives aren&#39;t nearly as wonderful<br/>
Have very old, deep, wise looking eyes because they&#39;ve lived and experienced things they shouldn&#39;t have<br/>
Have spiritual intelligence and/or psychic skills developed as coping mechanisms<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-225587409">I did write to the mom who had posted that list, and she said she had been making fun of it, so I&#39;m going to &quot;refriend&quot; her (looks like refried, as in refried beans).<br/>
<br/>
---------<br/>
 i mentioned that my littlest baby was hitting milestones early, and someone said that it was because he was &quot;filled with indigo&quot;. I&#39;ve been hearing this indigo stuff for a while and really had no clue what it was about. I&#39;m not specifically into the woo-woo stuff as it is, but I was curious to see what this indigo stuff was about. Then I saw all the opposition to authority and insensitivity stuff and I thought it was the most hilarious thing I had ever heard. My husband (who is a comedian) and I have been laughing and joking about it ever since.<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, it so totally sounds like someone&#39;s brilliant excuse for people to not want to follow traditional rules, as if logic and reason wasn&#39;t a good enough reason already. :)<br/>
__________<br/>
<br/>
I still think it&#39;s crazy.  I guess she does, too.<br/>

<br/>
A few years ago Dylan and I were in a bookstore in Newport, Oregon.  The owner asked me if Dylan was a Star Child.   I said, &quot;No, he is an Earth child.&quot;   And she went on talking to Dylan about Indigos and Rainbows and whatever else.   He was not demonstrating any ADHD behaviors or psychic abilities or lack of empathy so I&#39;m not sure what made her ask.   Maybe she thought he was younger than he was and so seemed mature.   Maybe his deep old eyes bugged out at some of her weird posters and doo-dads.  I don&#39;t know. <br/>
<br/>
As we were leaving another customer commented on some rabbits that were hopping about the yard and said they were all at the hose so she thought they were thirsty.   The Star Child expert asked, &quot;Do rabbits drink water?&quot;    Oh, right.  You know about child visitors from other planets here to save the earth but you don&#39;t know that rabbits drink water.  That makes you seem credible and smart. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really disturbing.  I try to be calm about it but I think superstition and ignorance is dangerous and terrible and I wish people cared more about honesty and truth than serving up magic crystal bullshit. <br/>

I had the strongest vision of a Just Add Light and Stir post with that quote (&quot;�Deb Lewis&quot;) and a picture of a sparkly-eyed crystal bunny, but no...  It&#39;s a good sentiment, but not the daily inspiration the parents of young, vulnerable kids need, I guess.    As a bonus round of inspiration, though, I&#39;m happy for it to be on this list.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s true.  It was pretty ranty.   I was out watering my garden and thinking about garden gnomes running yahoo lists and felt bad that I hadn&#39;t been more positive and less cranky. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sorry that Dylan knows there are people in the world who think aliens are populating the earth with special star children in order to save us all.    I might not have thought to look that up or share it with him and now he knows.   I&#39;m not sorry he knows about people who think the world will end in October or that the earth is flat or that ionic bracelets are powerful medicine.   I&#39;m not afraid of him having all kinds of information about the world he&#39;ll always live in.  Unless he&#39;s called home by the star people.<br/>
<br/>
(There is a movie from 1956 called, &quot;Warning from Space&quot; where star shaped aliens try to warn the people of Earth of impending doom.  I will forever picture Star Children as worried, sparkly starfishies.) <br/>
<br/>
I know some people who kept their little kids out of school because they thought teachers were witches.   They had issues with circle time and rhymes seeming too much like covens and chants.   They thought then needed to live in a godly haven apart from the secular world.  All of those kids went on to public high school.  Couple of them were pregnant young and having problems.  Keeping information from kids can be a big mistake.  Their parents will always think it was the evil world corrupted them, not that ignorance is terrible and costly.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re saving and making plans for Dylan to go to Europe next summer.  He&#39;ll be staying in hostels and using the Eurorail and my stomach hurts every time I think about it but he is so smart and so well informed that nothing he finds there will confound him or shock him or stagger him.   He&#39;ll have language challenges but he&#39;ll be ok.   I am glad he knows not every person is as sensible as his mom. &lt;g&gt;  Not everyone has reliable information or good ideas.   I&#39;m glad he knows the difference between fear and reality, truth and nonsense.  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not much more positive but somewhat less cranky. &lt;g&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My partner and I used Eurail and hostels when we backpacked through Europe ten years ago (was it really that long?!). I don&#39;t know if this will comfort you, but the trains were a truly excellent and very safe way to get around, and the hostels a fantastic place to meet fellow travellers and swap stories and info. I would not have missed it for the world! And what we learned on the trip! Not just world class art, history and culture, but also self-reliance, independence, and the freedom you only have when everything you own is in your backpack and there is nothing stopping you from jumping on the next train to Munich or Antwerp or Prague. I can very much empathise with a parent&#39;s worry for their child heading out on a big adventure, but I&#39;m also pretty sure it will be the trip of a lifetime for Dylan. Happy travels!<br/>
