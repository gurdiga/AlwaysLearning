<div id="ygrps-yiv-90120049">Sorscha asked me to post her `urgent message&#39;.   The state of New <br/>
Mexico in the USA is completely out of Build a Bear Pumpkin Kitty and <br/>
she&#39;s desperately trying to purchase one for her collection.  I have <br/>
exhausted my local search and also contacted the main office to no <br/>
avail.   She bid on several on Ebay but keeps loosing them to higher <br/>
bidders.  She is concerned the price on Ebay is going to go up and up.  <br/>
Some stores in the US still have a few of these bears for the original <br/>
price.  <br/>
<br/>
If anyone in the US wouldn&#39;t mind checking their local BaB and picking <br/>
one up for her (unstuffed), we will send you a check for the bear & <br/>
postage immediately.  Please contact us off list at <br/>

Thank you so much for considering.  This means so much to her and I <br/>
want to try everything I can to help her obtain one at a reasonable <br/>
price.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-15165076">WOW, ya&#39;ll are amazing!  Thanks so much for all the eyes and phone <br/>
calls to make this happen for a child in our community.  Unschoolers <br/>
are the absolute coolest people!  <br/>
<br/>
We want to thank Eric & Jules in LA for finding a bear!!! THANKS!<br/>
<br/>
I also just wanted to post a few things of appreciation that my <br/>
Radical Unschooled kiddo has said after I read everyone&#39;s post to <br/>
her. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;That is soooo nice.  That is probably one of the nicest things <br/>
someone has done for me. I feel loved!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Everyone did that just for me - brain overload.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I can&#39;t believe someone is going to drive to a store - out of their <br/>
way - just to get one for ME!&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
&quot;This is one of the happiest days of my life.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She is soooo appreciative and grateful.  Ohhh, now she said, &quot;Mom, <br/>
what was the happiest day of your life?  When I was born????&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Funny kid - I just love her.<br/>
Thanks so much again.<br/>
