<div id="ygrps-yiv-1572500397">There&#39;s a very unschool friendly article in the NY Times today --  <br/>
that isn&#39;t even about unschooling. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Written by a researcher, she&#39;s discovering what we already know but  <br/>
with the added patina of science to give it more weight.<br/>

Your Baby Is Smarter Than You Think<br/>

Excerpt:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Babies and young children are designed to explore, and they should  <br/>
&gt; be encouraged to do so.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The learning that babies and young children do on their own, when  <br/>
&gt; they carefully watch an unexpected outcome and draw new conclusions  <br/>
&gt; from it, ceaselessly manipulate a new toy or imagine different ways  <br/>
&gt; that the world might be, is very different from schoolwork. Babies  <br/>
&gt; and young children can learn about the world around them through  <br/>
&gt; all sorts of real-world objects and safe replicas, from dolls to  <br/>
&gt; cardboard boxes to mixing bowls, and even toy cellphones and  <br/>
&gt; computers. Babies can learn a great deal just by exploring the ways  <br/>
&gt; bowls fit together or by imitating a parent talking on the phone.  <br/>
&gt; (Imagine how much money we can save on �enriching� toys and DVDs!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But what children observe most closely, explore most obsessively  <br/>
&gt; and imagine most vividly are the people around them. There are no  <br/>
&gt; perfect toys; there is no magic formula. Parents and other  <br/>
&gt; caregivers teach young children by paying attention and interacting  <br/>
&gt; with them naturally and, most of all, by just allowing them to play.<br/>
<br/>
