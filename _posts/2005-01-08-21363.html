<div id="ygrps-yiv-990245143">FINALLY after years and years...<br/>
I was happy to be able to buy a Korean copy a year and some back, and it  was <br/>
cheap too (though all the notes and credits on the DVD outside the film  <br/>
itself are Korean).   For whatever combination of reasons a movie  written by the <br/>
same guy who got awards for Shakespeare in Love was profoundly  unavailable, <br/>
here it is now.<br/>
 <br/>
For anyone who liked Shakespeare or theatre or fun philosophical  <br/>
goofings-about, this is a really good thing to see.  No doubt Netflix will  have it when <br/>
it&#39;s available too, and they have a waiting-list way to  request something <br/>
that&#39;s not yet out but will be someday.<br/>
 <br/>
The stars are  Rim Roth, Gary Oldman, and Richard Dreyfuss<br/>
