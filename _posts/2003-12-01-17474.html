Subject: [UUHomeschoolers] Reminder:December 1st Call In Day<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hello Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I am here to post this reminder about the Call in Day to Washington<br/>
DC about the homeschooling bill (HONDA) that is being discussed in<br/>
congress. I also wanted to tell everyone that there is a site that<br/>
is conducting an online petition about<br/>
the bill. Last night it had more than 750 signatures. You can add<br/>
your name* by going to<br/>

<br/>
*Signers may choose to hide their identity to the public. Such<br/>
names will appear as &quot;Anonymous&quot; on the PetitionSite.com site.<br/>
I hope you all will take the time to become informed about this very<br/>
important issue.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the Call information-Please feel free to pass it along.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to request that all homeschool groups and individuals<br/>
in this country that are not represented by HSLDA call the White<br/>
House on December 1 to let them know that :<br/>
<br/>
A) All homeschoolers in this country are not represented by HSLDA<br/>
and Mike Farris<br/>
B) If you oppose HR2732/SB1562 please tell the White House/President<br/>
Bush<br/>
C) Remind them that federal legislation of education is<br/>
unconstitutional<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
