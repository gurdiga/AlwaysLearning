<div id="ygrps-yiv-622597363">I can totally get why a 2 year old wouldn&#39;t have the patience to &quot;wait until<br/>
Christmas&quot;.  Maybe you could not put out the presents until it&#39;s a little<br/>
closer to Christmas eve?  Maybe you could find older, forgotten toys of his<br/>
to wrap, and put one of those a day under the tree for him to tackle?  Maybe<br/>
you could intersperse those with a few new toys?  I&#39;d only put out one a day<br/>
though, rather than have to tell him no no no all the time.  It could be<br/>
sort of like an advent calendar for him.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We don&#39;t put out the gifts for us until Christmas Eve - it was<br/>
just too frustrating for them (or as Alex would say frusterating - that<br/>
extra syllable sums it up for him).  They are 6 & 4.<br/>
<br/>
I have them help me wrap gifts for others and that isn&#39;t a problem for them.<br/>
They help with the tape, they decorate the wrapping paper and make the gift<br/>
cards.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1175165052">We celebrate Winter Solstice. So we put the presents<br/>
out the next morning which is kind of like a new year<br/>
for us...the begining of the next solar year. The<br/>
gifts represent the hope joy for the new year. When we<br/>
get gifts from friends and family they can be<br/>
unwrapped as we recieve them. The kids love to play<br/>
solstice and birthday and wrap and unwrap presents<br/>
it&#39;s lots of fun.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone rememeber liking to wrap presents as a<br/>
kid? My sis and I even helped wrap our own presents<br/>
that went under the tree. Wrapping and unwrapping<br/>
gifts is so fun. When I was little I was quite<br/>
offeneded when the gifts from Santa under the tree<br/>
weren&#39;t wrapped. I said &quot;Santa should wrap his gifts<br/>
like everybody else!&quot; Well he must have heard my<br/>
request because after that  Santa&#39;s Gift&#39;s were<br/>
wrapped ;)   <br/>

maybe. . . I like those ideas. . thanks a lot. Yesterday was soooo intense <br/>
for him because we had a family thing where we were doing a Pollyanna gift <br/>
for the adults. BIL was supposed to bring things from the dollar store for <br/>
the kids (three two year olds) and of course he forgot, so the inlaws brought <br/>
one thing for each of them. The problem is they were done, and the kids <br/>
especially QUinton, was looking to unwrap the rest of the gifts under the <br/>
tree, which was totally freaking out FIL, who is a complete control freak. I <br/>
would have wrapped up a bunch of stuff for them if I had known. . . anyway. . <br/>
.needed to vent I suppose. . . .<br/>

<br/>
Wrap his breakfast.<br/>
<br/>
Wrap his lunch.<br/>
<br/>
Wrap the toilet paper up (it comes wrapped when it&#39;s new anyway, usually).  <br/>
Wrap his toothbrush.  When he leaves the room, wrap up his pajamas and his <br/>
pillow.<br/>
<br/>
It will be so big and crazy he&#39;ll get over the urge, probably.  He&#39;ll be <br/>
sated.<br/>
<br/>
I did that with marty when he wanted fries daily and lots--was going through <br/>
every drive-through around, getting just their smallest pack of fries, and <br/>
excitedly zooming off to the next place.  He finally said &quot;No more fries, <br/>
mom, please.&quot;<br/>

Christmas Eve.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
We developed a tradition of not putting the gifts under the tree until<br/>
Christmas Eve, only partly because of disorganization.  It kept both dogs<br/>
and children from helping themselves (my old Airedale would *eat* Christmas<br/>
presents - and tree ornaments!).<br/>
<br/>
One year, when Alex was maybe 2 and Laura 5, we bought one of those small<br/>
table-top trees.  I set it on a card table, then put red corrugated paper<br/>
all around the legs, so it looked like a big box.  I got really wide green<br/>
ribbon at a craft store to make cross-shapes on each side, and a huge bow on<br/>
the front, so overall it looked like the tree was sitting on a present.  We<br/>
then stashed all the presents inside the big box.  It was a fun way to deal<br/>
with having absolutely no storage space in the house for hiding goodies, and<br/>
kept the tree out of reach of children and animals.<br/>

LOVE to shred paper....and as they get bigger they like to cut it into tiny<br/>
shreds.....it can be nerve wracking when there&#39;s shredded paper everywhere,<br/>
