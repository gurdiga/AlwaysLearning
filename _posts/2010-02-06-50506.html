<div id="ygrps-yiv-1320861917">I saw the email about the Deschooling Support Group and wondered what is in<br/>
place for the Unschooling Support?  Is there a group other than just<br/>
online?  I may need assistance soon in that area and anything you can tell<br/>
me (sites, etc) would be appreciated. I am going through a very rough<br/>
divorce, and he is now questioning my Unschooling Style. He may ask the<br/>
court to have me put my daughter in public school, so I would like some<br/>
information that I could give the judge in support of Unschooling. Any help<br/>
is appreciated greatly!  Thanks.<br/>

Unschooling is something each family does.  There&#39;s no certification,  <br/>
no organization to join.<br/>
<br/>
One possibility is to sign up with a distance school and create a plan  <br/>
which is basically unschooling, but someone else will oversee and  <br/>
report.<br/>

or<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www2.cruzio.com/~beachhi/home.html">http://www2.cruzio.com/~beachhi/home.html</a><br/>
<br/>
And if neither of those can help you maybe they&#39;ll have ideas for  <br/>
someone who can, but the help would be enrollment in a school, not  <br/>
defending homeschooling.<br/>

<br/>
He probably will ask the court to have your daughter in school.  Even  <br/>
if he didn&#39;t, the court might require it anyway, because the court  <br/>
system is conservative and protective.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry not to be more encouraging.  Divorce almost always ends  <br/>
unschooling, if not right then, about the time the dad gets a new  <br/>
girlfriend.<br/>
<br/>
There are ways to make school more bearable, though, and also the  <br/>
possibility that if school isn&#39;t going well you could try to  <br/>
homeschool a different way.  Or there&#39;s the possibility of going with  <br/>
more traditional homeschooling, at least on the surface, without fully  <br/>
committing to that other curriculum.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you are in my state, California, I&#39;d suggest joining a charter or <br/>
private school that supports unschooling, or maybe relaxed schooling.  <br/>
If you&#39;re in another state, I&#39;d suggest getting in touch with people in <br/>
your own state, because this is really a legal issue and the laws are <br/>
different in every state.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it is at all likely that you&#39;re going to convince a judge <br/>
to allow unschooling.  It is hard, still, to even convince a judge to <br/>
allow regular homeschooling - most divorces end up with children in school.<br/>
<br/>
Those I know who have been successful in getting a judge to allow <br/>
homeschooling have all compromised by enrolling kids in some kind of <br/>
educational option - charter, distance, school district independent <br/>
study, something...<br/>
<br/>
There is some good advice, here (some is state-specific, so ignore that <br/>
if you&#39;re in a different state):<br/>

<br/>
The best advice that I could give, would be to not go there.  If a marriage can be reconciled that&#39;s even better.  In court, don&#39;t even bring up unschooling at all, if it needs to be said, say homeschooling.  That is the legal exception to school in most places.  Don&#39;t even talk about specifics.  A judge won&#39;t consider unschooling to be legal, as it&#39;s not, homeschooling is, and unschooling is just one way to do that.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
One of my very closest friends and favorite people has her oldest son, and soon her 2 young daughters, in school.  She is pretty open minded, was very attachment parenty (the way I think of it, what it used to mean), and is a great mom in my opinion.  She just can&#39;t get unschooling, can&#39;t relax that part of her brain enough to get it.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, she approaches school very much like what Sandra has written on the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice">http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice</a> page.  She is a little detached from it, doesn&#39;t place nearly as much importance on school as the administrators would like, and her son is very happy in school.  Please go to the link and read it, even if you don&#39;t want your kids to end up in school, it may ease your mind about it since you may not have a choice.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And really, if you have to do it, your kids will be happier there if you can find a way to be happy and relaxed about it.  <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-904031059">***The point I&#39;m trying to make is that the original intentions of lists<br/>
don&#39;t always last as long as the lists last. This one is an<br/>
exception.***<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Right.  You (and Joyce and Pam) are uniquely dedicated unschooling advocates and writers.  It&#39;s what makes this list consistently good with solid information and help.  UnschoolingDiscussion too, though those are not lately so busy, the information there is valuable and worthwhile because Sandra and Pam and Joyce take their responsibilities to those lists seriously. <br/>
<br/>
What will keep a support list a support list if many who join want philosophical discussion?   The same thing that keeps a discussion list focused on philosophy and principles when some members want to find a personal mentor and hand holder.   It takes the daily dedication of the list owners and judicious use of the moderated status feature&lt;g&gt; and not all list owners will have the dedication or patience or time.    <br/>
<br/>
I could not do it.  Our lives have changed so much over the years, changing jobs,  long unemployment, husband away a lot so me the only in resident parent, cook, chauffeur, playmate... taking care of my mom... that I have not lately had the time to write much.   Maybe others are more organized and write with more ease but the truth is Pam and Joyce and Sandra are all moms with homes to take care of and jobs and responsibilities and they still *make* the time to help unschoolers *every day.*    <br/>
<br/>
 So, it&#39;s irritating when someone complains they&#39;re not getting just the right kind of help and maybe they could hand pick certain sweet people to give just the right tender support as if those kind volunteers don&#39;t have plenty else to do, families and lives and work enough already. <br/>

<br/>
If someone wants a personal mentor and hand holder they can easily find them.  They exist for a cost.  A local woman where I live said that she&#39;d rather pay someone for advice than get it freely from the likes of Sandra... sorry Sandra.  Guess what?  She can do just such a thing!  Will it be better than what she can get for free?   If someone pays money to another for such a thing, how will they know if they&#39;ve got their money&#39;s worth?  At what point does it cost too much to have someone hold your hand?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve not hired any personal mentors, but the ones that I know of, I wouldn&#39;t hire, they have less experience than I do at this point.  Even years ago, I wouldn&#39;t have.... the very best of the best advice on unschooling is given here for FREE!  If I had the money I would send it off to Sandra anyway to help her keep her sites up and running because they are invaluable!  What she&#39;s done over the years is HUGE, and she&#39;s not the only one!  Those websites that Joyce and Sandra keep up cost money to host.  I think it&#39;s awesome that they do it and anyone can go and check it out and get lots of value out of them!<br/>
<br/>
I totally understand the rant!  Someone on the Radical Unschooling Network thought that Joyce&#39;s word were great, but that she shouldn&#39;t have written them.  That&#39;s seriously irritating.  I wanted to reach out via web and slap that woman, but I didn&#39;t, I wrote back as kindly as I could summon up defending Joyce.  Joyce takes time to thoughtfully write about unschooling and she&#39;s really clear and analytical.<br/>

&quot;She writes diamonds in a world of crystals.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And I snorted when Joyce wrote this:<br/>
