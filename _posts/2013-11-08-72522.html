 </div></div></span></blockquote>little kids an epidemic rate of nearsightedness in preschoolers has occurred.&lt;&lt;<br><br><div>You can do all kinds of things with a handheld device or computer, some of which have been shown actually to improve vision.<br>
<br>The optometrist has drawn a conclusion from an anecdotal (i.e., <span>not necessarily true or reliable, because based on personal accounts rather than facts or research) association. And, as they say in statistical research, association does not imply causation. </span>On the other hand, as this review article documents:<br>
<br> <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://archopht.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=420394">http://archopht.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=420394</a><br><br> there is a well documented link between educational pressures and increasing myopia rates. HOWEVER, the JAMA article also points out that it is not schooling in itself that cause nearsightedness -- that&#39;s just an association, too -- instead, limiting peripheral vision too early HAS been shown to contribute to nearsightedness. So, based on the existing research, pushing children 
to read or to do any other task that limits their peripheral vision is a
 bad idea. But I don&#39;t personally know any preschoolers who like to read on their iPads or other devices. I have seen them playing games, though. I would be interested to see any research showing that playing computer games limits peripheral vision, or has any bad effect on vision.

<br></div><div>Finally, here&#39;s a bit of anecdotal evidence that contradicts the optometrist&#39;s: my husband and I were pushed to read from a very young age and are both very nearsighted and have worn glasses from the time we were young children. We didn&#39;t grow up playing computer games. Our 11 year old son was NOT pushed to read early but has played computer games from a young age, and he appears to have excellent vision. <br>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1576535021"><p dir="ltr">My friend wasn&#39;t only drawing on personal experience. She is not against gaming either. She told me that the information was from a European study that she trusted and she believes the problem is focusing on very small objects for too much time at a very young age just like children reading young.. My eldest son read the most at a very young age and he is very near sighted. My other two also read young (it just happened) but didn&#39;t spend so many hours a day focused on books (my youngest just wanted to read to play video games) and they both have great vision. I am sorry if this started controversy. I was sharing something I learned from someone I trust because I thought it was relevant.  I never even suggested taking phones away from toddlers (which is when the apps seem to start attracting). I thought the idea of a bigger screen or a little distance was worth looking at.</p></div>

<br/>
Vaccinations (and polio vaccine from the 1960&#39;s) are looking increasingly dangerous, and people who avoided them are relieved.    Still, it&#39;s never been a great discussion to have in light of unschooling, because it&#39;s the same (whatever it is) for unschoolers or not.  There&#39;s not something different for unschoolers, about vaccinations, or electromagnetics, or flouride, or too much sunshine or too much water or whatever all else is  being looked at askance.<br/>
<br/>
I know someone who had a house built with one inside switch she could turn off every night, so that she wasn&#39;t sleeping within electronic fields.  In her case it was part of a large set of extremely paranoid behaviors.  She&#39;s probaby not wrong about everything she was afraid of.<br/>
<br/>
I think that for unschooling, the main thing is not to limit or shame or frighten children about things that aren&#39;t proven.  <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s something to be said for living fully in one&#39;s own time and place.  What if time travel delivered you someone from ancient Rome who said he had never been to a temple, never been to the colliseum...   (Partly I&#39;m joking, and mostly I&#39;m not.)   I have a friend my age (we met in our early 20&#39;s) who lived through the 1960&#39;s in New Mexico (though Los Alamos, a hive of geeks) never owning a pair of denim jeans and never listening to rock&#39;n&#39;roll At All.  He married someone who bought him jeans for camping, and he came to appreciate them.  <br/>
<br/>
Cigarettes were in fashion; now they&#39;re not.<br/>
When coal fires  (and the mining that went with them) were more common, there was a lot of air pollution, damage to buildings, soot all over things.   It wasn&#39;t healthy.<br/>
<br/>
Dentistry hasn&#39;t been moving along as quickly as some other sciences, it seems.  Amalgam fillings aren&#39;t great.  Full dentures weren&#39;t great.<br/>

Being careful without being irrational, being protective without being controlling... those can apply to lots of things.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-49821871">Quickly googling the list of folks whose opinion you trust all of them seem to be finding issue with electromagnetic radiation. Dr. Havas did a study with 4 diabetics whose insulin levels she attributed to their electromagnetic radiation exposure. From what I&#39;ve read, it was purely anecdotal. With such a small sample size experimental design with case control would be the only way I could see getting meaningful results. If her other studies are similar, I wouldn&#39;t rely on her findings to inform your fears. I would look for a more measured body of research. Dr. David Carpenter led me to this interesting Front line transcript: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/programs/transcripts/1319.html">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/programs/transcripts/1319.html</a> Olle Johansson attributes cancer to FM radios and coil spring mattresses moving EMFs around in a significant frequency. More things to be afraid of? Or, possibly, some kind of bias in how he looks at data?<br/>
<br/>
Looking at the IARC&#39;s 2b carcinogen list, where EMF&#39;s live, there are inclusions like carpentry and joinery, aloe very extract, coconut oil, for example. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.emfandhealth.com/WHO%20Bulletin.html">http://www.emfandhealth.com/WHO%20Bulletin.html</a> has a commentary on the finding with a link to the list of carcinogens scaling from 1 to 3. <br/>
<br/>
The Bioinitiative report has also come under serious criticism for its lack of balance and very selective inclusion of studies that conformed to the committee&#39;s beliefs. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinitiative_Report">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinitiative_Report</a> has a series of criticisms.<br/>
<br/>
I understand how such fear mongering can work to make you afraid. It helps not to look for things to be afraid of, particularly if those things are things your children enjoy. Don&#39;t work to be afraid of carpentry if your child loves to build with wood, don&#39;t find massive danger in charcoal if your child enjoys drawing with charcoal, don&#39;t make computers and the internet the bogeyman when they love playing WoW. Your fears aren&#39;t going to keep them safe, or happy. When you start wanting to protect them from something they love, go do something else with your brain. Help them to enjoy their joys.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1701136766"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  I guess it boils down to this: Though I strongly think that there is, I am not absolutely sure that there is a problem posed by electromagnetic radiation and I agree that more studies need to be done. However, I feel better erring (for now) on the side of caution. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I never fully understood the saying &quot;a little information is a dangerous thing&quot; until I had Ethan.  Once he was born I began to fear so many things.  Electronics seemed scary to me.  Certain foods seemed scary to me.  Television seemed scary to me.  Old houses were scary due to lead and other contaminants.  The soil was scary to me.  We lived in Pittsburgh for the first four years of Ethan&#39;s life.  Dig a couple inches into the earth there, and you find layers upon layers of coal dust.  And so it went, until I finally realized that the atmosphere of fear I was generating for myself, and as a byproduct for my son, was so much more detrimental to our wellbeing than any of the issues I had touched on in readings and in conversations with other parents.  So, I began to let go of the fear, learn to make mindful choices, and live fully in the real world I found myself in - not in the protected bubble I wanted to make for Ethan.  And, life became so much easier.  So much richer.  So much more real and meaningful for all three of us. <br/>
<br/>
Some parents will limit food to the point of nutritional deficit, afraid of all the additives, allergies, and other dangers written about to caution us.  Some parents will limit access to information and the world at large, creating a learning deficit, fearing perceived dangerous influences over young developing minds.  Some parents limit the variety of people they allow their children to interact with, afraid their children will stray from family policies on how to live in the world.  Different reactions to different fears, sometimes overlapping, all starting with a little bit of information. <br/>
<br/>
Forgive me if I&#39;m wrong, but I think the point of the discussions on Always Learning is not to highlight and learn to live with potential dangers, but to help parents fear less and learn to live with their children in a more whole and enriching way.  The sky has been falling for a long time now in many different stories, in many different ways.  And yet, when we raise our chins and look around, it&#39;s still there, sometimes grey, sometimes the most wonderful shade of blue.  There have always been things to fear in our world, from wooly mammoths, to the plague, to cancer.  They are all real.  In different times, in different places, they have all threatened individual lives.  No one can predict when and if we&#39;ll face such a challenge.  What we can hope to influence as unschoolers is *how* we face real challenges, how we move forward if we&#39;ve successfully overcome such a challenge, how we live in a world full of challenges, but also full of potential wonders.  <br/>
<br/>
By giving our children real information when their questions arise, by encouraging them to make real choices, by helping them live fully in the real world we find ourselves in today, and by surrounding them with as many reasonable opportunities as we can afford and as they desire, we, as parents, facilitators and partners, can give them a clearer picture from which they can draw more meaningful conclusions today and tomorrow.</div>

<div style=""><span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR:transparent;">My Ex is sensitive to fluorescent lights. Something about them causes her to have heart palpitations. For years she thought she had a panic disorder because she&#39;d get heart palpitations while shopping, until I read an article about &quot;environmental allergies&quot; (or something like that, this was back in the 90s) and fluorescent lights were mentioned. With a little experimentation we were able to confirm that lights were the issue, found grocery stores that used different lights - suddenly she was able to shop independently after years of needing to go with a buddy, in case she had a &quot;panic attack&quot;. <br></span></div>
<div style=""><span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR:transparent;"></span>&nbsp;</div>
<div style=""><span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR:transparent;">People can be sensitive to the darnedest things - but what&#39;s going on, what a person is reacting to - isn&#39;t always immediately obvious. Research can be good... but don&#39;t scare yourself. Experimenting with alternatives can be good, but be skeptical. Sometimes what&#39;s &quot;wrong&quot; with a child is that parental expectations aren&#39;t lining up with the reality of that child. </span></div>
