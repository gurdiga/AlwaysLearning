&gt; &gt;word) kid.  She was surprised at how calm and knowledgeable she was.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A friend of mine and a different friend&#39;s teenage daughter were having a<br/>
&gt; conversation in the locker room of their health club. A woman who overheard<br/>
&gt; them came out and asked the adult who that kid was, she was SO articulate<br/>
&gt; and smart. My friend said that the girl was homeschooled. The woman <br/>
&gt; replied,<br/>
&gt; &quot;I used to be against homeschooling, but after hearing that, I&#39;ve changed <br/>
&gt; my<br/>
&gt; mind.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And believe me, it was just an ordinary, everyday conversation they were<br/>
&gt; having, not rocket science or advanced mathematics.<br/>

Yeah, I&#39;m impressed with Julian, but certainly will agree that I may be <br/>
biased. But almost daily people meet him and are blown away by him...again, <br/>
not talking about Times Tables and Narrative Essay Writing, but normal <br/>
conversation, where he talks with passion about music, history, things he&#39;s <br/>
read, making chain mail, politics, etc...<br/>
<br/>
Recently Julian and I had this program in RI scheduled, and decided to go out <br/>
the night before to visit my aunt and uncle. I hadn&#39;t seen them in a long <br/>
time, since way before my mom died, and we were bringing my aunt a memento <br/>
from my mom&#39;s things.<br/>
<br/>
After being astonished by Julian&#39;s size, we had a very nice dinner where they <br/>
were fascinated at how smart and interesting he was. They have relatives that <br/>
are homeschooling their kids in a very bad situation (probably kids will be <br/>
removed relatively soon, for VERY just cause), and kept talking about how <br/>
THIS is how homeschooling should look. I actually started describing <br/>
Unschooling (usually don&#39;t bother), and they were enthusiastic.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not hard to see that this is okay...even if you&#39;re someone who is <br/>
concerned with kids knowing &quot;the  basics,&quot; you can talk to someone and <br/>
KNOW...it&#39;s so sad when people, who ostensibly love someone, don&#39;t bother to <br/>
do that.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand...this is a woman who referred to her children when they <br/>
were kids as Dumb Fuck 1 and 2.<br/>
