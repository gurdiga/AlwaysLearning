<br/>
We recently went to Disney World on vacation with the kids.  on a <br/>
side trip, we went to Crystal River to swim with the Manatees.<br/>
<br/>
What an awsome experience!!  We only expected to see the Manatees <br/>
from a distance but as soon as we were in the water one came righ up <br/>
to us.  We rubbed our hands over it&#39;s back and believe it or not, it <br/>
rolled over and used it&#39;s fim to push our hands down on it&#39;s tummy <br/>
for a belly rub - no jole, I have pics!!<br/>
<br/>
What a great way to get the kids interested in endangered species. <br/>
Not everyday you get to interact with one in their natural <br/>
enviroment. We rented a boat from<br/>
Manatee Boat Rentals. Below is the link. There are also group tours<br/>
offered but we wanted one on one time and renting the pontoon was<br/>
cheaper!! Only around $100 for the day. There are some campgrounds in<br/>
the area, but I wouldn&#39;t plan on staying for more than a couple of<br/>
days - not a whole lot else to do there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-397921906">Heather, <br/>
   <br/>
  We used to live just down from Crystal River (my son Logan was born at Seven Rivers Hospital there) in Homosassa, not 5 minutes from the wildlife park. The manatees are wonderful, beautiful creatures! I never went swimming with them though, the entire time I was there. I wish I had now...but I used to take Sarah and Logan up to the park alot to watch them. <br/>
   <br/>
  If I&#39;m learning one thing now though unschooling is to not waste a chance to do something neat! We were there for four years, I swim and snorkel...and I never took one day to hang out with the manatees and I was RIGHT THERE!<br/>
   <br/>
  Oh..if you go down that way again, try the mermaid show at Weeki Wachee! <br/>
   <br/>
