&lt;&lt;  I get the sense, from the pools I&#39;ve been to, that this is a safety <br/>
issue, brought about by insurance companies or safety studies, etc., and that <br/>
there is a recommended or maybe even required amount of time per hour/session <br/>
that <br/>
the pool should be cleared. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well that makes way more sense.  Thanks.  I forwarded it to all of them.<br/>
<br/>
Poor kids who  have only been left at the pool for a short while, though, to <br/>
lose a 15 minute chunk of their precious time.<br/>
