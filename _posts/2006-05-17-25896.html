<div id="ygrps-yiv-773284392">I&#39;d like to announce the exciting new online publication of <br/>
*Connections—ezine of unschooling and mindful parenting*, a monthly <br/>
online magazine dedicated to keeping readers thoughtfully informed about <br/>
topics relevant to unschoolers of all ages.<br/>
<br/>
Created by unschoolers for unschoolers, the zine will feature regular <br/>
contributions by unschooling advocates Ren Allen, Danielle Conger, <br/>
Sandra Dodd, Deb Lewis, Kelly Lovejoy and others; columns by Anne Ohman <br/>
and Rue Kream, author of _Parenting A Free Child_; as well as an <br/>
unschooling kids’ section, “Mouth Off,” showcasing the thoughts, writing <br/>
and talents of unschoolers themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Connections will offer two feature articles each month in addition to <br/>
the regular contributions; monthly reviews of books, resources and <br/>
websites; coverage of unschooling e-list “hot topics”; “Virtual Visits” <br/>
and “Inspiration Station” for interesting ideas; and a “Snapshots” <br/>
gallery of unschooling in action.<br/>
<br/>
The entire contents of *Connections, Issue 0*, along with the amazing <br/>
photography of Jessie Fields in our premier “Snapshots” is now available <br/>
free online at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://connections.organiclearning.org">http://connections.organiclearning.org</a><br/>
<br/>
Please feel free to pass this announcement along to other unschooling/ <br/>
homeschooling groups.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you enjoy!<br/>
