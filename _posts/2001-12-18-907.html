<div id="ygrps-yiv-2009663711">Hoping someone here might have more pertinent information than what&#39;s gleaned <br/>
from the web. Some kids in our community are trying to form a &quot;Junior Order <br/>
of the Knights of Pythias.&quot; I first heard about it when my son asked me what <br/>
the Knights are Pythias are. We went to the web (our usual avenue of <br/>
research) and found lots of websites of the orders. We&#39;re still kind of <br/>
uncertain what the group is or does. Anyone?<br/>
