<br/>
Went with a Homeschooling group to this lovely historic farm where most of the buildings are from the 1800s and the farm gives tours of life in a farm from that period. The highlight of the day for us was our friendly, knowledgeable, patient hostess Sandy. Raghu said he could cook in their 1800s kitchen forever. I felt a teensy bit closer to Laura Ingalls, Raghu and Zoya discussed the similarities between a real farm and their Minecraft farm, Raghu milked a cow and loved it, Zoya loved walking around and stroking the many cats. They got to do farm chores and then cook their own breakfast. And when Sandy asked what important event happened around 1860, the video-gaming child newly landed from India said &#39;the American Civil War&#39; without batting an eyelid. He would have liked to ask Sandy about how the farm weathered the war but they had to run to the next chore.<br/>

Though both the parents have lived in the U.S., the kids just lately moved to New Jersey from Pune.<br/>
Pretty cool that Raghu was the one to answer the question. :-)  I love stories like that. :-)<br/>

One time it even resulted in us being asked (by the teachers) if we&#39;d like to join the class on the extra &#39;schools only&#39; part of their excursion - we got to go out into the mangroves with the school kids and look through the mud for living creatures - and LiAM was the one who made the presentation to the rest of the class about what his group had found (he was happy to share the excitement of what they&#39;d found and no one else in his group wanted to speak).

<div><span style="font-size:13px;font-family:Georgia;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size:13px;font-family:Georgia;">I asked Kirby today whether other kids went in after he did, and he said &quot;The people I taunted into going did.&quot;</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size:13px;font-family:Georgia;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size:13px;font-family:Georgia;">So if it hadn&#39;t been for an unschooler in that group, maybe none of them would have wanted to climb up in a truck in front of other kids, to report back down that the could NOT see that concrete block as big as many automobiles they might be driving.  It was about safety, and it&#39;s an excellently memorable idea, provided by interesting and interested people.  I was impressed to hear of it.  My kids were always jazzed by that teacher&#39;s stories and ideas.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size:13px;font-family:Georgia;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size:13px;font-family:Georgia;">WHY would someone NOT want to do something cool, though?</span></div><div><span style="font-size:13px;font-family:Georgia;">Recently at an unschooling event, there were adults who didn&#39;t participate in a stand-up game, even when I asked them twice.  My prediction is that their children won&#39;t be as likely to be those kids who jump up and say &quot;I will try it!&quot;  </span></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1289568697"><div dir="ltr">Yes, but when they are &quot;whole and calm and present&quot; like their parents, it isn&#39;t because of the parents&#39; genetics.  <div><br></div><div>Genetics can be a very mixed bag.... the same trait that will make a person creative and expressive can also contribute to making a person explosive and angry.  I think that unschooling parents are more present to partner with their child and model behavior that is peaceful and joyful, but still accepting of the acuteness of the emotions.  </div>
<div><br></div><div>I used to joke that if I didn&#39;t want &quot;dramatic children&quot; I would have needed to adopted and then hired a nanny.....   We tend to experience life very keenly and are very reactive.  I wasn&#39;t surprised when I had sensitive babies who grew up into sensitive children.  </div>
<div><br></div><div>Many times, I have said &quot;Our feelings are our feelings, and no one can tell you that they are right or wrong.... but the way you express yourself can make other people feel either good or bad&quot;.    The trick was saying it at the right time in the calm and peaceful voice that was HARD for me.... but having kids when I was a tad older helped.</div>
<div><br></div><div>I also think that not spending hours a day immersed in the stress laden environment of a school was certainly better for peaceful living and growing.  My children had choices about when and where and who they spent their days with.  <br>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1608867384">Right, but I was responding to the sentence saying that friends claimed that they liked your children because they liked you.  Genetics.  <div><br></div><div>My two children are adopted and now unschooled.  I get a lot of feedback from adults on my son who they say is very friendly and sociable and they find it refreshing.  My daughter is very shy and rarely responds to adults ever.   So, I think it is part unschooling, part genetics and part personality.<br>
