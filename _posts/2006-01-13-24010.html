<div id="ygrps-yiv-681303941">&quot;It was a<br/>
very nice smaller restaurant with very upscale quality gourmet<br/>
food. The owner Delores, who also the chef and namesake of the<br/>
restaurant, was a grandmother and she LOVED kids. She even kept a<br/>
corner of the restaurant with a toy box and play area for kids who<br/>
didn&#39;t want to sit at the table all the time, and they were free to<br/>
wander back and forth to it any time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
One of my favorite place to eat in Portland was an upscale dining<br/>
establishment, built in an old victorian style house that had a play<br/>
area upstairs. <br/>
The family diners were separate from the other diners, but with other<br/>
families...only about 4-5 tables up in that area. But you could get<br/>
fine wines, gourmet food etc... while the kids played with brio and<br/>
dolls and blocks...<br/>
It was awesome. Old Wives Tales was another Portland fave, with<br/>
vegetarian fare, casual atmosphere and a brightly painted playroom<br/>
right next to the dining area.<br/>
<br/>
I MISS those types of places...the South has yet to catch on about that.:)<br/>
