&lt;&lt; We live just south of Portland in a little town called Lake Oswego.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Aaaah, good &#39;ol Lake Oswego.  I lived in Beaverton formerly....also Gresham, <br/>
Vancouver and Battleground.<br/>
Now in the South and missing Trader Joes, the waterfront in Portland, Good <br/>
Earth (at Clackamas Town Center), the Gorge and the MOUNTAINS!!!<br/>
<br/>
However, we don&#39;t miss Tanya Harding, the rain or the grey skies. LOL<br/>

&lt;&lt; This Oregon talk has me missing the place.  I lived in Portland and<br/>
 Forest Grove and drove every weekend to sleep on the beach at Pacific<br/>
 City&#39;s Cape Kiwanda. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ooooh, another former Portlander!! sigh....<br/>
I used to go into Forest Grove with my Grandma to swim laps. My Dad graduated <br/>
from the HS there......they live on a farm in Manning. Do you know where that <br/>
is? It&#39;s very obscure, mainly was farms in old times.<br/>
If you&#39;re heading to the beach it&#39;s the turn off just before that Dairy Queen <br/>
on Hwy. 26...Hayward road.  Beautiful country.<br/>

&lt;&lt;   I have visions of weeks and weeks with no sun.<br/>
 Is that the case?  How do you adjust?  Do you get depressed? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know you didn&#39;t ask me Isabel..but as a former Portland lover, now living <br/>
in Florida, I feel qualified!!:)<br/>
Yes.<br/>
No.<br/>
Yes.<br/>
How&#39;s that for blunt? I can handle the rain, love rain actually. But the day <br/>
after day of grey sky and drizzle I hated. No can do.<br/>

&lt;&lt; If none of those factors (those or the wristbands) will help, then maybe <br/>
 Dramamine? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Dramamine works wonders for my ds&#39;s car sick moments. But if we give him <br/>
Ginger ahead of time, he doesn&#39;t get carsick.<br/>
Ginger would be the natural cure for any nauseated moments.<br/>

<br/>
The Good Earth is gone! *sob*  They had some of the best food I&#39;ve ever<br/>
eaten and I miss them.  Seeing the Gorge still takes my breath away, I<br/>
never get tired of taking guests there.  My mom and I will be going to<br/>
The Maryhill Museum Of Art this August, she wants to take me there so we<br/>
can have some time alone.  All I can think about is how much the kids<br/>
would get out of the trip.<br/>
