<div id="ygrps-yiv-870900261">Yesterday my 10 you dd and I took our walk through the cemetary as usual (she rollerblades.)  She found a cool, long walking stick.  When we came upon a tree with a hole in it, she stuck the stick in wondering what we&#39;d find.  I had a horrible vision of an angry squirrel flying out and biting one of us.  She found nothing, so I took the stick and pushed it down into the hole.  When we pulled it out it was covered with soft, gooey shit!  What&#39;s up with that???<br/>

Do you mean &quot;shit&quot; literally?  <br/>
Or &quot;stuff&quot;?<br/>

Honey is the happiest answer.<br/>
<br/>
Decomposed squirrels is the grossest answer.<br/>
<br/>
Tree sap?  Maybe the tree&#39;s bleeding internally into a hole?  <br/>
<br/>
Do you know what kind of a tree it was?  <br/>

I literally mean shit.  I&#39;m thinking back now to the bark and it seems to me it might have been maple.  Wouldn&#39;t squirrel nuggets be solid, like rabbit nuggets?<br/>

I&#39;m on Kirby&#39;s computer with the evil 9.0 aol, so my last post might&#39;ve been <br/>
dopey on the quotations--sorry.<br/>
<br/>
If squirrel poo dissolved in sap of some sort, it would be like... y&#39;know... <br/>
what you said. <br/>
<br/>
Kind of like a turd in the lemonade.  All becomes poo.<br/>

Mice make rice  (very, very brown rice).  I&#39;m not sure what maple-tree<br/>
squirrels leave in their holes.<br/>

Do you often use the term &quot;nuggets&quot; when describing excrement?  When my dd<br/>
was in diapers, I coined &quot;Baby McNuggets&quot; for the solider waste found there;<br/>
it was the best deterrent to eating at McDonald&#39;s....<br/>
