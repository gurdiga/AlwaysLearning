love it, and spend the rest of your time playing in the creek? I<br/>

I dont mind people not agreeing with me, but I am &#39;new&#39; here and have yet to gauge people&#39;s posting personalities..I think a few of the comments that have come across on this thread have me a bit reluctant to speak my honest mind for awhile, at least until I learn the &#39;tone&#39; of people&#39;s posts..One of the fallbacks to online posting, lack of &#39;tone&#39; in someone&#39;s voice and lack of body language =)<br/>
<br/>
I think the issue here (in the state) that I have seen is that the AEPs are going as far as to have people sign letters of intent to homeschool while at the same time enrolling into their program..It&#39;s a ploy by the school district to make people &#39;think&#39; they are protected under the homeschooling RCW when in fact they are not....And that all &#39;legal&#39; control lies in the hands of the school districts. This DOES pose a problem for us homeschoolers, when we have people who are not legally acting under the homeschooling rcw calling what they are doing &#39;homeschooling&#39;...I dont know if I am being any clearer or not, if not then I suggest the link I sent would be a better place for clarity =)..<br/>
<br/>
I am, quite honestly, not very familiar with California&#39;s laws and how it works there so I may have misunderstood a few of the things that came across as being CA when they are not so (Like having to turn in &#39;plans&#39; etc..)<br/>

list seems very good at separating ideas from personalities, if that<br/>
makes sense. I like that.<br/>
<br/>
Cacie is right now inventing an amusement park ride that is an enormous<br/>
fifties-style woman, in a poodle skirt and all that, hula-hooping... and<br/>
the ride, as I understand it, involved people being somehow attached to<br/>
the hoop (or maybe strung into the hoop, like giant beads?), so she hulas<br/>
and everyone zooms around... she&#39;s telling my dad about it as she hulas<br/>
in the kitchen, I&#39;m just listening in. :-)<br/>

the hoop  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Holly today said she wanted a hula hoop.  I reminded her she had cash, and <br/>
they&#39;re not very expensive.  So tomorrow, it&#39;s on our list:  hula hoop.<br/>
<br/>
And at the moment (nine minutes after midnight), Holly&#39;s sitting on the floor <br/>
behind me with a piece of paper trying to figure out how many different <br/>
positions four people could be in at a movie theatre, sitting together in the <br/>
same row.  She asked me, and quick&#39;n&#39;dirty I said more than twelve, and maybe <br/>
28.  Then I said &quot;Not 28-less.&quot;  So she&#39;s working it out (without numbers) <br/>
and says she thinks 24.  <br/>
<br/>
Keith will know the formula, but he&#39;s asleep.  <br/>
<br/>
We played with graph paper and guessed that maybe with five it will be 60, <br/>
and marked that.   Telling here SOLIDLY that I could well be wrong, we played <br/>
with the proportions.  But she&#39;s messing with her charts and thinking it&#39;s <br/>
way more than 60.  <br/>
<br/>
If someone had been here to answer her question succinctly, she might not be <br/>
as interested right now.<br/>
<br/>
Also, today she saw Donald in Mathmagic Land (an old Disney educational <br/>
video) which they have as a &quot;free rental&quot; at Hollywood Video behind our <br/>
house.  She watched it through once, stared at the credits, and said &quot;That&#39;s <br/>
a lot to think about!&quot;  Tonight she wanted to watch it again, but not by <br/>
herself.  I watched it with her.  This morning, a visiting 13 year old came <br/>
and sat through the last half of it in fascination, too.<br/>
<br/>
But never did I suggest she could use that information in the future, or that <br/>
it was something she might remember from here or there.  SHE is organizing <br/>
her mathematical knowledge in her head, and hardly needs anyone&#39;s advice <br/>
about what&#39;s like what!<br/>

whole factorial thing, and it comes in handy for math puzzles a lot. <br/>
<br/>
Very cool. <br/>

She said they did it on Zoom once, but she didn&#39;t remember the answer.  She <br/>
remembered the problem being realy interesting, though.<br/>
<br/>
Holly loves Zoom.  The new season started just last Friday, so they have some <br/>
new kids.    She had asked me to record it a week ago Frday, when she went <br/>
swimming with other homeschoolers.  I said &quot;No show will start a new season <br/>
on a Friday.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was wrong.  But luckily it wasn&#39;t THAT Friday.<br/>
<br/>
While she was gone, I looked up articles on the new season, forwarded links <br/>
to her e-mail, and she was able to have the scoop for her friend who also <br/>
loves Zoom.  The new season is planning to have local segments too, and so it <br/>
will not be Zoom from WGBH in Boston, now, it will be Zoom from KNME in <br/>
Albuquerque (with the main outline being Boston-produced).<br/>
<br/>
That was cool for her to know, and then I knew when the new season was to be. <br/>
 We taped it AND she watched it, and just went to swimming a little later.<br/>
<br/>
She and her friend also really like and discuss Arthur.  And Holly likes <br/>
Dragontales. I think she likes it for the art, in part, as it&#39;s similar to <br/>
Rainbow Brite and My Little Pony, both art styles and story-styles she enjoys <br/>
on tape.<br/>
