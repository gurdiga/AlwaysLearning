<div id="ygrps-yiv-535607915">Thanks Pat and Deb L for putting perspective on what was being said <br/>
and apologies to Sandra for my outburst.... I was PMSing.... No <br/>
excuse but I&#39;m sure many of you are aware of that situation LOL...  I <br/>
think that being new to unschooling (7 months) I tend to get <br/>
defensive about the things that are happening in my household with <br/>
the kids.  I know this is a learning process for myself and the kids <br/>
and also how to just let things go and look at the positive in <br/>
information that is given to me from seasoned unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
I will not be lurking... that&#39;s not my style... Again apologies for <br/>
my bratty school like behavior and thanks for the input of all in <br/>
helping me understand more about myself and unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Dawn<br/>
PS  Please put on your calendar that Dawn PMS&#39;s at this time</div>

It didn&#39;t crush my feelings.  I was only concerned about the list itself.  <br/>
I&#39;m used to people jumping me for being straightforward, but I decided a long <br/>
time ago that I would continue to point out when when a statement or theory <br/>
or practice misses the potential of families and unschooling, and let the <br/>
chips fall where they may.  There will always be curriculum salesmen.  They <br/>
make a big cut of sales.  There will always be schools.   There might not <br/>
always be people who are willing to help other unschoolers for free.  Or <br/>
there might be, but they might be the people who don&#39;t quite understand it <br/>
themselves, or who tried it without a real understanding and reacted with <br/>
frustration, and tell other people it doesn&#39;t really work.<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby was six and seven I got a lot of criticism, and was openly <br/>
pooh-poohed with &quot;OH, you can ignore her; her oldest child is only seven.&quot;  <br/>
Now I&#39;m past the halfway mark with my kids  I figure when Holly&#39;s a teen and <br/>
up and out, I&#39;m not going to be as involved with others&#39; newness.  I had <br/>
first vowed to work at helping others be brave and unschool for four years, <br/>
because I felt really guilty about talking my cousin out of homeschooling.  <br/>
The four years have come and gone and I&#39;m still helping because it seems <br/>
helpful and appreciated--because I see the difference in families, and <br/>
because I get thank-you notes.<br/>
<br/>
When I respond to posts it&#39;s very rarely directed to the person who wrote the <br/>
post.  Sometimes it is, if a particular question was asked (especially on <br/>
unschooling.com, or a question about something specific), but in the general <br/>
philosophical exchange, I don&#39;t even look at who wrote what, and I will pull <br/>
a statement from someone else&#39;s quote and comment on it without ever looking <br/>
back to see where it first came from.  <br/>
<br/>
Because mailers have different automatic settings, some people&#39;s (and mine <br/>
too) will say &quot;Babbette wrote...&quot; just because a quote was taken from a post <br/>
where Babbette quoted someone quoting someone.<br/>
<br/>
I want to deal with ideas here, and not with the people who brought them to <br/>
the table.  There are some others on this list with the very same intent.   <br/>
Beginning unschoolers can go to unschooling.com and read a thousand ideas <br/>
today.  Anyone depending on this list (or any one source) for their total <br/>
unschooling support, idea-font, and guidance could be disappointed.  But <br/>
those who want to look at ideas in the light of unschooling that&#39;s working <br/>
shouldn&#39;t be disappointed as long as we keep the personal elements to a <br/>
minimum.<br/>
