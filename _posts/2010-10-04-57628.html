<div id="ygrps-yiv-2049127003"> Its amazing how learning is all connected.<br/>
Some may think that playing video games is a waste of time and that a child <br/>
needs a well rounded education.<br/>
I have a homeschooling friend that is really into all the well rounded classic <br/>
education.<br/>
Her kids have classes for; French, piano and ballet just to mention a few.<br/>
It was not like her oldest boy wanted to learn ballet or tap dancing. <br/>
He really wanted to do TaeKwon Do.<br/>
But he is stuck with Tap dancing and ballet. Hard for a kid build like a <br/>
linebacker that loves fighting  and stuff that is very boyish.<br/>
It is not that her kids all asked for piano lessons.<br/>
That is what they do.<br/>
<br/>
My son MD turned 8 this Summer and   has never really asked to learn any <br/>
instrument.<br/>
We have a piano he played a lot as a toddler. We had an acoustic guitar ( I fell <br/>
on it and broke it :(  )<br/>
 MD really loves playing video games. He loves Legends of Zelda and has many of <br/>
the games.<br/>
He has also read about 10 of the Manga books.<br/>
He is very interested in Knights and all that goes with Middle Ages until about <br/>
the Renaissance period.<br/>
SO Friday we went to the Minnesota Renaissance Festival.<br/>
It was school days so they had several events specially for kids .<br/>
We made plans to get there early before 10 AM so he could hear about swords and <br/>
fighting.<br/>
He listened to them show and demonstrate  combat for over an hour and was <br/>
totally into it.<br/>
On the way there, a two hour drive, he read his book about Knights.<br/>
Then we watched the jousting  and many other cool things around.<br/>
About one hour before we left I was in a store as Gigi , my 4 year old daughter, <br/>
was checking<br/>
out dresses and other girl stuff, I looked across the street and there is a <br/>
store with Ocarinas for sale.<br/>
Next I see a sign with a triangle that I recognize as the Tri- Force symbol for <br/>
Legends of Zelda.<br/>
I have not played any of the games but I listen and watch and I have read a few <br/>
pages of the books.<br/>
Mainly I have listened to my son talk about it.<br/>
There is one game that Link plays the Ocarina.<br/>
 SO we all went across the street and I bought him an Ocarina. They came with <br/>
 two sheets of songs including one with <br/>
<br/>
the music from the video games.<br/>
He practiced playing for almost two hours coming home and have practiced since <br/>
Friday.<br/>
I started writing this post just after he started to practice again. He <br/>
just got done and it has been almost one hour.<br/>
( I write a little, feed a kid, move laundry...)<br/>
So from liking Knights, swords, video games my son has found a musical <br/>
instrument that he wants to learn.<br/>
Ocarinas are hard but he is very happy with how he is playing.<br/>
This may not last long or it may. I don&#39;t know yet. But it is sure amazing to <br/>
see him learn so much and be happy with it.<br/>
