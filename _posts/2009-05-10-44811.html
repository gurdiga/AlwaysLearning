<br/>
Reading about ADHD after you have been diagnosed and saying &quot;That&#39;s me exactly&quot; is a lot like reading your horiscope and saying &quot;That&#39;s me exactly.&quot;  The definition is so broad that many parts of it could fit just about anybody.<br/>
<br/>
-----  i had read some research that suggested ADHD is not technically a medical condition and is used as an excuse to quieten down children who do not fit the system. ------<br/>
<br/>
When I taught middle school, one of the teachers I worked with suggested that any child who could not sit still in her (extremely boring) class should be medicated for ADHD.  During my experience teaching in both the public and private sector, and as a parent of children who previously attended private school, I learned that labels are primarily used for any child who does not fit in the system.  Typically, there is nothing wrong with the child.  The problem is the environment.  Rather than change the environment to suit the child, they try to change the child to suit the environment - sometimes by drugging the child.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
----- i was also wondering if there are any cases of ADHD among unschoohlers?-----<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have any children with the ADHD label, but I do have a son who has an Asperger&#39;s label.  That label was very pertinent when he was still in school.  It helped explain why he didn&#39;t behave the way the other children did - like the time he ran out of the classroom and climed on top of the school secretary&#39;s desk when the teaching assitant changed mid-year.  However, I discovered that the label sort of faded away once we started unschooling.  He has a lot more control over his environment now, and now people just see him as an introverted child who likes things to be a particular way.<br/>
<br/>
I imagine a label of ADHD would also fade away once a child no longer has to sit still and listen to a boring teacher.  Behavioral labels are about kids not fitting into the environment.  If you change the environment, the label will no longer apply.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2009842697">Regarding ADD:<br/>
<br/>
I do believe that there is a real entitiy of ADD.  I certainly see excessive movement, innattention and impulsivity in children that I care for as their family doctor.  I believe that their is a connection between these manifestations and the child&#39;s trauma history, attachment and coping skills as well as their brain system for attention.  It is extremely hard to tease out and understand the cause and affect between differences in temperament, differences in attachment, differences in parenting styles, and differences in expectations.<br/>
<br/>
It is interesting that a subset of adults, who identify themselves as havinghad these same behaviors in childhood do seem to have persistent problems in &quot;executive functioning&quot; in adulthood.  These people often do have improvement in their symptoms with the same medications used for children with ADD.<br/>
<br/>
My concern about the large number of childrem being treated for ADD, is that there is very often little or no effort made to determine if there is a cause behind the disruption of the chemical  brain system for attention and focus.  Many of the kids would be better served by attachment parenting, an unschooling approach, and attention to their early trauma.<br/>
<br/>
The other issue is that children with ADD are almost always treated because their &quot;symptoms&quot; bother someone else - like a parent or a teacher.  Adults with ADD choose to be treated, and many of those who do feel benefitted by the treatment.<br/>
<br/>
My son, with his extensive trauma history, usually does want to take his medication, and does feel that it helps him to feel better and do what he wants to do.  When he doesn&#39;t feel his medicine is a benefit, then he can choose not to take it.  Fortunately, medications for ADD work at the time they are ingested, and are rapidly metabolized, so these kind of decisions can be made based on what is happening in real time.<br/>

in the collective imagination of the American Psychiatric<br/>
Association. See this website:<br/>

<br/>
The reason why people recognise their behaviour in the &quot;diagnosis&quot; of<br/>
&quot;ADHD&quot; and similar invented concepts is the so called &quot;symptoms&quot; are<br/>
simply observations of that behavour to begin with. Write down a list<br/>
of behaviours, give the behaviours a name, tell somebody they have<br/>
the name because the name always consists of those behaviours and the<br/>
person with the behaviours forgets they have behaviours and thinks<br/>
they have the name. It&#39;s impossible for them to do otherwise. The<br/>
scam is foolproof unless you&#39;re aware of the methodology used by<br/>
psychiatry to invent its alleged &quot;disorders&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
If I like to chew gum, read Batman comics and wear yellow t-shirts,<br/>
in reality I&#39;m only somebody who likes to chew gum, read Batman<br/>
comics and wear yellow t-shirts. If somebody else perceives those<br/>
behaviours to be &quot;abnormal&quot; - a purely subjective argument - and<br/>
decides to group them together and call the resulting artificial<br/>
conglomeration &quot;Plonkiness&quot;, we might then see an article in a glossy<br/>
magazine entitled, &quot;Do you suffer from Plonkiness?&quot; And what are the<br/>
&quot;symptoms&quot; of Plonkiness? Chewing gum, reading Batman comics and<br/>
wearing yellow t-shirts. Oh my gosh, that describes me exactly. I&#39;ve<br/>
got Plonkiness. No, I like chewing gum, reading Batman comics and<br/>
wearing yellow t-shirts. Plonkiness is a figment of the imagination. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;ADHD&quot; is a figment of the imagination. Which is not to say that the<br/>
behaviours don&#39;t exist, and, yes, some people find them troublesome.<br/>
It&#39;s that the American Psychiatric Association&#39;s supposed<br/>
&quot;explanation&quot; for the behaviours is a pernicious little fantasy.<br/>

Hi Michelle<br/>
My daughter (16) recieved a diagnosis of ADHD & anxiety DO between 7th & 8th grade while still in school.  Getting a diagnosis was my last ditch effort in helping her manage in school by getting a plan that the teachers were &quot;supposed&quot; to be legally obligated to follow.  However because she was still having trouble functioning and wasn&#39;t being medicated they started putting a lot of pressure on me.  <br/>
<br/>
I finally took her out of school and she did choose to take medication for anxiety for awhile until she got a handle on it herself.  she has tried medication for ADHD and said it does help but chooses not to take it because it disrupts her sleep too much.  She may decide to take it if she starts following a more traditional schedule or is taking classes full time.  <br/>
<br/>
The way she explained it is while she was at a group she could look at something else and still hear and attend to what the leader was saying.  Usually she is visually distracted and no longer &quot;hears&quot; what is going on.   She has trouble watching someones face while they are talking without being distracted.  She does the best if she is focusing on doing something with her hands while listening.  She doodles or fidgets with something.  As you can imagine the classroom was a horrible learning enviornment for her.   Right now she is self medicating with caffiene and is able to ask for help with attending to things when she needs to.  She adapts to her own style just like everyone else.<br/>

<br/>
Bob&#39;s right.   Another way to think of ADHD is &quot;school allergy,&quot; or  <br/>
&quot;school intolerance.&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But I was a hyper active kid who loved school.  There are all kinds of  <br/>
ways individuals deal with their own personality traits and their own  <br/>
biochemistry.   Anyone who CAN &quot;pay attention&quot; for 45 minutes to  <br/>
something they already know or totally don&#39;t care about or can&#39;t  <br/>
understand a word of is in worse shape than the one who understands  <br/>
already and wants to do origami and let music play in her head.   I  <br/>
could &quot;do&quot; (imagine in detail) full Beatles albums in my head, in real  <br/>
time, with the exact length of the breaks between songs on the album,  <br/>
with the same relative key changes from one song to the next, and many  <br/>
a U.S. History class was bearable because I had  those albums in my  <br/>
head, and that&#39;s how I physically kept myself in the chair and quiet.<br/>
<br/>
Because I was &quot;ahead&quot; and &quot;gifted&quot; and &quot;a good student,&quot; my hyper  <br/>
activity was given the respectful name of &quot;boredom.&quot;   Those kids who  <br/>
were less interested in playing the &quot;do this to get an &#39;A&#39;&quot; game, or  <br/>
who really didn&#39;t understand or didn&#39;t give a rat&#39;s ass, if they had  <br/>
the same sort of biological consitution I had, they were bad, and  <br/>
troublemakers.<br/>

<br/>
I can pay attention but speakers probably still have no idea what I&#39;m <br/>
paying attention to.  I don&#39;t hear well and reading lips and facial <br/>
expressions is something that fascinates me because every person&#39;s is <br/>
different.  I may have a pretty good handle on what&#39;s being said <br/>
generally while my main focus is really on the visual aspect of body <br/>
language, social interactions and things like that.<br/>
<br/>
It has been said that people can only give attention to one thing at a <br/>
time... but that&#39;s probably not strictly true for many people.  So the <br/>
disability of ADHD may simply be the superability to attend to many <br/>
things at once and still find that it&#39;s not enough to keep them <br/>
interested.  Uhm..... who&#39;s disabled really?  The teacher who can&#39;t <br/>
provide that much to interest with.  Ooops.  So now it&#39;s a bit like <br/>
that story by Kurt Vonnegut where people are artificially handicapped <br/>
with drugs and other things to hold ADHD folk down.  The homogenization <br/>
of the school populace.<br/>

<br/>
Roya (my 24 year old), used to tap her pencil or shake her foot or just <br/>
wiggle and squirm and whisper to other kids - in school. Like Sandra, <br/>
she was considered &quot;bored&quot; or &quot;chatty&quot; rather than learning disabled or <br/>
ADHD. The labels were reserved for those whose difficulties impacted the <br/>
teacher or kept the child from learning what the teacher was teaching. <br/>
Roya loved her teacher and got along well with other kids and was <br/>
already a good reader and writer, and she enthusiastically participated <br/>
in school/class work and activities - she just couldn&#39;t sit still.  Her <br/>
school didn&#39;t have textbooks, lectures, typical homework, or tests, or <br/>
grades, and her teacher let her sit on the floor in the leg-space under <br/>
the teacher&#39;s desk whenever she wanted so that she could wriggle and <br/>
squirm around without bothering other kids. She still can&#39;t sit still <br/>
and do nothing with her hands, so she carries needlepoint or knitting <br/>
with her at all times.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The way I am looking at it is that she chooses to use caffiene as a tool to function better so I refer to it as self medicating.   I don&#39;t see that as a bad thing or that functioning without it would make her less or worse than with it.   Lizzy and I have had some conversations about how some kids might develop a problem with pot or alcohol because getting high feels so much better than how they usually feel they think they need it.   I asked her to imagine if she hadn&#39;t learned to be ok and cope with feeling anxious and then got high that she might feel that she  needed to get high every time she was anxious.  For her refering to it as self medicating means she is in control of using it not that it controls how she feels.  <br/>

When I was a kid, I had a great imagination and would day dream my way through classes cause I knew I had to be there.  Now, nothing is manditory so I just get up and leave, make up excuses if there are not any real ones.  When I get emotionally overwhelmed in anyway I cant sit still.  I notice this with one of my sons.  He gets embaressed during a movie for example and starts running around the house, hiding, talking, anything to remove himself. I sometimes wonder if that is what happens to some kids in school.  But they are not allowed out.</div>

&gt; &gt; Helping your daughter to see it as something she enjoys, is better than<br/>
&gt; &gt; helping her see it as self medicating.  School has clearly done some<br/>
&gt; &gt; damage to how she handles her world.  She is learning how to adapt<br/>
&gt; &gt; without it being so pervasive in her life, part of that should include<br/>
&gt; &gt; how she views self medicating.  There is some aspect of her or you that<br/>
&gt; &gt; is still seeing a need for medicating if that is in your terminology.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The way I am looking at it is that she chooses to use caffiene as a tool to function better so I refer to it as self medicating.   I don&#39;t see that as a bad thing or that functioning without it would make her less or worse than with it.   Lizzy and I have had some conversations about how some kids might develop a problem with pot or alcohol because getting high feels so much better than how they usually feel they think they need it.   I asked her to imagine if she hadn&#39;t learned to be ok and cope with feeling anxious and then got high that she might feel that she  needed to get high every time she was anxious.  For her refering to it as self medicating means she is in control of using it not that it controls how she feels.  <br/>
&gt; Kelly<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My kids and I frequently have conversation about the power of language.  You are applying  medical terminology to a common beverage, and I think it&#39;s worth thinking about whether framing it that way is useful or helpful to your daughter in feeling &quot;normal.&quot;  I think that language highlights the existence of a &quot;condition.&quot;  If it helps you to think in terms of managing a condition rather than living and finding what works, then I suppose that language fits.  <br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m reposing the question, because when the last poster did, you replied with a defense.  I think most probably understand why you&#39;re using the term.  But the issue is bigger than just one family making a choice to use that term.  The more people think in these terms, the more the paradigm is fed that we all have problems that need some sort of external management.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had a friend say that she thinks we&#39;re all &quot;on the spectrum.&quot;  But she wasn&#39;t meaning the spectrum of human difference.  She meant a medically dysfunctional spectrum, and some people require more intervention than others.  I just can&#39;t see it as helpful to unschooling to call the morning Starbuck&#39;s self-medicating.<br/>

I&#39;ve known people who drink or smoke pot without developing problems<br/>
with it.  It has to do more with the reasons we do things.  If it is a<br/>
form of escapism, then the underlying need to escape from something, is<br/>
what needs to be addressed.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a good thing to find ways to cope with anxiety other than, finding<br/>
ways to escape from it.  It&#39;s even better if you can find ways to remove<br/>
anxiety causing elements in ones life, although there will always be<br/>
times of stress at some point or another.<br/>
<br/>
It seems clear that school has been the source of a pattern of anxiety<br/>
and stress and the need to deal with it.  Now that it isn&#39;t a part of<br/>
her life, the anxiety and stress should lesson and the patterns can<br/>
become less and less.  It doesn&#39;t help to perpetuate that by using<br/>
terminology like self medicating.  Perhaps see it as many many different<br/>
tools to use in many different situations.  Caffiene doesn&#39;t even have<br/>
to factor into that at all.</div>

 If you are trying to let go of the idea: &quot;My child has a problem <br/>

I say &quot;maybe&quot; because I disagree with this:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Caffiene isn&#39;t necessarily a medicine.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Caffeine is very definitely a psychoactive drug; it affects <br/>
the central nervous system and many other parts of the body, too, <br/>
in lots of different ways.  It increases both mental and physical stamina.  <br/>
(Until 2004, the International Olympic Committee listed it as a <br/>
banned substance.)<br/>
<br/>
To let go of the idea that ADHD is a problem is one thing; to deny <br/>
that caffeine is a drug that positively enhances mental focus, on<br/>
the other hand, is to lie to oneself (or one&#39;s child, as the case may be).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also wondering if &quot;self-medicating&quot; is a bad thing, in and of itself.<br/>
<br/>
Suppose I burn myself, and decide to break a leaf off my aloe plant and <br/>
apply the liquid to the burn?   Or to return to caffeine: It is a bronchodilator.  <br/>
I have asthma, and I do not like the side effects of my rescue inhaler, so <br/>
I will sometimes self-medicate with caffeine to see if that will relieve my <br/>
symptoms.  I&#39;m not bothered by the label &quot;asthmatic&quot; (although I am bothered <br/>
by the asthma!) so I don&#39;t see a problem choosing to self-medicate.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that the phrase &quot;self-medicate&quot; only seems negative<br/>
if one is carrying negative feelings about the condition one is treating.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m trying to think of a positive way to feel about ADHD.<br/>
<br/>
I refuse to give it the &quot;disease&quot; label.  Not hearing well is very <br/>
different from saying I&#39;m hearing disabled.  It&#39;s not a disorder or <br/>
disease.  It is a condition.  Ok.  But not really a medical one.  For <br/>
one thing, my hearing is somewhat intact, and I make good use of what <br/>
hearing I have as well as greater use of other senses to compensate for <br/>
what I lack with hearing.  I suppose I could use pot to enhance my <br/>
concentration on hearing and consider that self=medication.  I doubt if <br/>
doing so continuously enough to do my hearing any good would help the <br/>
rest of me function very well.  I think it would be too much focus on <br/>
hearing at the expense of other things.<br/>
<br/>
Focusing on ADHD (which I consider to be, as I posted earlier, a <br/>
superability) at the exclusion of other things is unlikely to help a <br/>
person function very well.  School focuses on ADHD because they want to <br/>
function well at the expense of some of the students.  Not a good focus <br/>
in my opinion.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;To lie&quot; is putting it overly strong here.<br/>
<br/>
Caffeine is a substance with psychoactive effects.  To argue the  <br/>
definition &quot;a drug&quot; is probably  not worth doing.  Anyone who wonders  <br/>
can go and read those debates elsewhere, but because caffeine is found  <br/>
naturally in certain plants and isn&#39;t a chemical additive in coffee or  <br/>
tea, it&#39;s coffee and it&#39;s tea.   It&#39;s in chocolate, too, and chocolate  <br/>
has other nervous-system benefits.  So does tea.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Using&quot; tea or coffee or chocolate is not the same thought or purpose  <br/>
or viewpoint as &quot;drinking&quot; or &quot;eating&quot; coffee or chocolate.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;ve learned from my kids growing up so differently their whole  <br/>
lives is that they can tell what food or drink they need because they  <br/>
have an awareness of their bodies and the various effects foods have  <br/>
on their digestion and nerves, and they might choose spinach or fish  <br/>
or lettuce or ice cream in ways that will balance something in their  <br/>
moods or functions.   That&#39;s wonderful.  It&#39;s amazing!  I&#39;ve been  <br/>
gradually learning to do it too, but I have voices in my head they  <br/>
don&#39;t have in theirs.<br/>
<br/>
If I say &quot;My kids self-medicate with spinach or fish or lettuce,&quot; I&#39;ll  <br/>
be saying 1) there&#39;s something wrong with them and 2) they are &quot;using&quot;  <br/>
a certain food.<br/>
<br/>
What they&#39;re doing is eating, with a mindfulness and an awareness most  <br/>
humans in this culture don&#39;t even know exists.<br/>
<br/>
If I were to defend using &quot;self medicates with fish,&quot; how would it  <br/>
help me, my children or anyone on this list?<br/>

<br/>
I couldn&#39;t agree more.  I have two sisters with some dyslexia, one more <br/>
than the other.  Both are very good (better than most people are) at <br/>
certain things that they couldn&#39;t do as well if the focus was on <br/>
dyslexia as a problem.  Because they see things differently, more <br/>
mobilely, they have abilities to a degree that most people don&#39;t.  Both <br/>
are very astute with people, great with anything visual and they do a <br/>
lot of things others can&#39;t do.  The sister who has the most dyslexia is <br/>
better at those things than the one with less dyslexia.  As far as I <br/>
know, I don&#39;t have dyslexic perspectives.<br/>
<br/>
People are different.  They have different sets of abilities.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a video Pat Robinson posted one time about that very thing.  <br/>
How about making a bird focus on swimming when they fly better than <br/>
most can swim.  If you make a cheetah focus on climbing instead of <br/>
running like the wind, what will that do really?  Should we focus on <br/>
medicating things or cast a spell to grant abilities to do anything we <br/>
wish others would do.  Or do we enjoy who they are?<br/>

She is adamant that if anyone drinks caffeine drinks they will become addicted to it.<br/>
<br/>
That people get addicted to candy and things with High Fructose Corn syrup etc.<br/>
My kids have Lot of candy and pop in the house to pick and choose whenever they want.<br/>
They just drink very little pop and eat candy as much as other stuff.<br/>
<br/>
My 3 year old likes Diet Coke like her Daddy ( she is a daddy&#39;s girl) and she will take a couple of tiny sips for it and she is done for the day of for days.<br/>
My son likes water and sometimes will drink a  little pop.<br/>
<br/>
My sister&#39;s kids come over to my house and they go on a scavenger hunt through my cabinets to find candy. <br/>
I have told her many times about all we talk here in this list but she goes from agreeing with me and buying them stuff to controlling and saying it is really bad and addictive.<br/>
<br/>
While she does that her kids act crazy about it. My kids would never go crazy about candy, not even after  eastern . <br/>
My sister gave my kids a beautiful Easter basket full of candy and presents. My kids loved it but only tried some of the candy and left it around the house. My sister&#39;s kids ate all my kids&#39; candy while on a visit a few days later. Even stuff that was on the floor!<br/>
<br/>
Why can&#39;t people see that?? My sister is so convinced that eating at McDonald will make her addicted that she says she likes McDonald&#39;s hamburger over anything else.<br/>
That if you drink pop with caffeine ( even once  day) will make you addictive to it. And she is the kid that always drank coffee with milk since she was a tine toddler and went years without even liking coffee years later.<br/>

feeling like kefir, or green beans, or anchovies, or blueberries.  <br/>
I trust my body to know what it needs.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, as an aside to the original post, I *really* was wondering <br/>
if that phrase, &quot;self-medicate&quot; is *always* negative?  A &quot;Phrase<br/>
to Hear and Avoid?&quot;  That&#39;s my question; I&#39;m not arguing<br/>
in favor of using labels like &quot;ADHD.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
The only positive thing I can think of about that label is that when <br/>
the kindergarten teacher tried to attach it to my son, it opened up my <br/>
husband&#39;s mind to my POV, that our children should not be in school, <br/>
especially at the tender age of five.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;To lie&quot; is putting it overly strong here.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sincere apologies; I didn&#39;t mean offense.  In learning to<br/>
live more mindfully, I am learning to think and speak<br/>
more carefully, too, obviously with *lots* more to learn.<br/>
The funny thing is, until a couple of days ago, I was<br/>
thinking of exploring NVC... because I know I can be<br/>
tactless, but the recent, um, can we call that a conversation??... <br/>
turned me off.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If I were to defend using &quot;self medicates with fish,&quot; <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, that &quot;self medicates with fish&quot; does sound really<br/>
funny!  I was gardening this afternoon, and thinking<br/>
this question over, and I realized that &quot;self medicates&quot;<br/>
sounded like a positive phrase to me because I was<br/>
focusing on self care.  Caring for oneself (in both<br/>
senses of the word caring) is important and positive.<br/>
And taking medicine isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing to<br/>
do.  And yet, &quot;self medicates&quot; on second thought,<br/>
doesn&#39;t sound very nice.<br/>
<br/>
So long (for now) and thanks for all the fish!<br/>
(I couldn&#39;t resist; &quot;self medicates with fish&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1243309311"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;My sister is so convinced that eating at McDonald will make her <br/>
 </span></blockquote>addicted that she says she likes McDonald&#39;s hamburger over anything <br/>
else.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Really?  That&#39;s funny.  I used to think McDonald&#39;s fries were the best <br/>
thing in the world and once I got out on my own I bought fries often, <br/>
and grew to hate the grease on them and if I get them now I&#39;m usually <br/>
sorry (gross).  I love the salt and potatoes, hate whatever they use <br/>
for oil.  It tastes greasy to me.  I thought the burgers were great <br/>
until I had a number of them and thought they tasted like cardboard.  I <br/>
am not sure if this is due to the introduction of a new line of burgers <br/>
where perhaps McD&#39;s uses a better source of meat for a time and then <br/>
switches to a lesser quality ... or what!  Maybe yum was just all in my <br/>
head.  Have you noticed that they stopped providing courtesy trash cans <br/>
in drivethru&#39;s?  Maybe all that courtesy and providing better quality <br/>
is too costly in this economic climate.<br/>
