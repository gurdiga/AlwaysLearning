<div id="ygrps-yiv-2052532230">Hi, <br/>
<br/>
A bit late. I receive this weekly science related email and it has lead to many simple, fun experimenets that have jump started us to deeper learning. And other times it gets no interest at all. I read them and file them and pull them out if I think 1 of my 3 may be interested. I have an interest in science, so sometimes I simply enjoy them for myself with no one taking notice.<br/>

<br/>
it is a yahoo subscription and the man loves food, so lots of his experiemnets are edible.<br/>
<br/>
Example, earthquake plate tectonics. this came following receny quake/tsunami<br/>
<br/>
Cake piece on plate and jello on plate. imagine a city on each. Wiggle the plate and decide which land mass you think is more safe. Cake =bedrock, jello=landfill. Eat it all when you are done.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-332770406">Good call, Mary. I read all of these. I just read them - but sometimes <br/>
we&#39;ll be doing something and it&#39;ll involve those materials from one of <br/>
Krampf&#39;s little experiments so I&#39;ll just show off what I learned! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re super simple - and usually just really interesting ways of <br/>
answering questions that I sometimes hadn&#39;t thought to ask, like: When <br/>
I boil water in the microwave and then put a tea bag into it, sometimes <br/>
the water sort of &quot;explodes&quot; out of the cup. What&#39;s up with that?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Short and sweet and understandable answers and little quick easy ways <br/>
to demonstrate them.<br/>
<br/>
