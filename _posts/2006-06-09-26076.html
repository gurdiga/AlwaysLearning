<div id="ygrps-yiv-235310862">Okay ya&#39;ll, help me figure this out.  When a child/preteen/teen is expected<br/>
to put their signature on something (bank accounts mainly) are they supposed<br/>
to use cursive?  I mean isn&#39;t that what a signature is?  Please help me with<br/>
this cuz I am a bit freaked out...<br/>
 <br/>
Seth went pre-k through 5th grade in school and of course learned and was<br/>
required to write in cursive but since he has been out of school he has<br/>
forgotten how to sign his name in cursive.  It is very frustrating to me cuz<br/>
I feel like this is something he should just be able to do almost on<br/>
auto-pilot.  One thing I do not expect is him to know all the letters or<br/>
anything.  I don&#39;t know or care to know how to write in cursive but I CAN<br/>
sign my name.  I don&#39;t expect him to do anything but sign his name.  Am I<br/>
expecting too much?<br/>

Subject: [AlwaysLearning] Cursive/Signatures<br/>
<br/>
&quot;are they supposed<br/>
to use cursive? I mean isn&#39;t that what a signature is?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
A signature is supposed to be unique to the signer.   Lots of folks do not<br/>
use cursive or even the full name. <br/>
<br/>
Now if he goes into the military he will have to sign lots of forms and<br/>
papers using his full &quot;legal&quot;  name with the same spelling as on the birth<br/>
certificate or social security card.......a bit of a pain for those who<br/>
spent their whole life being known by their &quot;middle&quot;  name.   One of our<br/>
family stories is a cousin whose first name was &quot;Buddy&quot;.   When getting a<br/>
security clearance he had to go back and re-sign everything because it<br/>
turned out that his birth certificate had spelled it &quot;Buddye&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
But back to  Seth.   Encourage him to develop his own unique signature which<br/>
could be in cursive, in manuscript,  in a combo of the two, or a series of<br/>
symbols.  The idea is that it should be reproducible (by him),  and<br/>
eventually......NOT  so easily reproducible by a forger!   THAT is the whole<br/>
point of having the &quot;printed&quot;  name below a signature on legal documents.<br/>
A signature does not need to be &quot;legible&quot;  and certainly does not need to be<br/>
in schoolboy cursive. <br/>

<br/>
Holly had a fancy signature for a while with a flower for the O  <br/>
(petals around the O).<br/>
That would work if she always used that and others would have a hard  <br/>
time guessing it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine broke her neck and after that her signature was an  <br/>
X.  But even before that, she was a block-printing kind of person all  <br/>
the way, a graphics artist who used a Rapidograph even to sign checks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-310537561">I was going to go and see if I could find by google any discussion of  <br/>
legal definitions of signatures and like that.  The first thing I  <br/>
found wasn&#39;t directly useful, but is interesting.  It was for a  <br/>
handwriting profiling company.<br/>
<br/>
-=-First, all writers are asked to provide a full-page handwriting  <br/>
sample on the Handwriting Sample Form  with the writer&#39;s signature  <br/>
and date at the bottom using an ink pen (no felt tip pens, markers or  <br/>
pencils) in the custom they are most comfortable with (print or  <br/>
cursive).  If the writer generally prints, have them include at least  <br/>
one paragraph of cursive writing.    All reports are confidential.-=-<br/>
<br/>
====================================<br/>
<br/>
I question their definition of &quot;ink pen.&quot;<br/>
I&#39;m guessing they mean ballpoint pen.   But ballpoints don&#39;t really  <br/>
have good ink, in a history-of-ink kind of way.  If someone said &quot;ink  <br/>
pen&quot; to me out of that context, I would guess they meant a dip pen,  <br/>
like a Speedball, to dip in ink—or a fountain pen, with real liquid  <br/>
ink out of a bottle.<br/>
<br/>
The stuff that&#39;s in a ballpoint pen, if you squirt it out in a  <br/>
puddle, is just a colored grease spot.<br/>
<br/>
So as to handwriting analysis, if someone usually (as I do) uses a  <br/>
felt tip pen, the writing with a ballpoint won&#39;t be their &quot;real  <br/>
writing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Just interesting to me that some professional handwriting analysis  <br/>
outfit considers there&#39;s a right kind of pen, and that a paragraph of  <br/>
cursive from a writer who generally prints, would tell them something  <br/>
worth charging money about.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t remember if this has been mentioned on this list (and no  <br/>
doubt when the question is asked again in a year or two it might come  <br/>
back around), but &quot;signature&quot; has to do with the sign of the cross,  <br/>
with swearing in the name of the father and the son and the holy  <br/>
spirit to an agreement.  the X was at one time a more vertical X—a  <br/>
cross.  But sometimes the document had a red cross already painted on  <br/>
and the &quot;signer&quot; swore to the agreement while his finger was on the  <br/>
already-written cross.<br/>
<br/>
Found something, but this and everything else I&#39;ve read in the past  <br/>
half hour or so supports printed signatures being fine:<br/>
<br/>
-=-Legal definitions and validity of &quot;Signature&quot;<br/>
There is no general statutory definition of &quot;signature&quot; in Australian  <br/>
and New Zealand statute law. Through many court cases over hundreds  <br/>
of years, judges have defined &quot;signature&quot; as containing these elements:<br/>
<br/>
.        Writing, drawing or affixing;[11]<br/>
<br/>
.        With your own hand;[12]<br/>
<br/>
.        A version of your own name, or your initials, or &quot;any mark  <br/>
which identifies it as the act of the party&quot;[13];<br/>
<br/>
.        With the intention of authenticating a document as being  <br/>
written by you, or legally binding on you.[14]<br/>
<br/>
Rubber stamps with the name of a company or person are also legally  <br/>
valid to serve as a signature.[15] A person may also authorise  <br/>
another to sign documents on his or her behalf.[16] Long before the  <br/>
advent of electronic signatures, the law recognised the legal  <br/>
validity of facsimile signatures - an early victory for electronic  <br/>
commerce! [17]-=-<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if a child&#39;s signature &quot;means&quot; anything before the legal <br/>
age of consent anyway. My son recently opened up a savings account <br/>
with a check he received as an inheritance. He signed the check <br/>
(printed his name), but i had to sign it anyway. He wouldnt have <br/>
been able to open the acct without me. He cant withdraw money <br/>
without me either. <br/>
<br/>
When Seamus got his passport he was around 4 yrs old, its &quot;signed&quot; <br/>
with his name, but its his father&#39;s handwriting not his. <br/>
<br/>
When you sign any legal paperwork (like a check, or a contract), <br/>
your signature is a kind of consent or a promise. Children can&#39;t <br/>
legally consent to things like that before a certain age (usually <br/>
18), so i dont see how it matters whether they use their &quot;real&quot; <br/>
signature or not. <br/>
<br/>
My mom is disabled from a stroke. She signs paperwork but its not a <br/>
signature, its a very child-like block printing. Its still her mark, <br/>
it still counts. <br/>
