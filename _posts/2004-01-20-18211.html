<div id="ygrps-yiv-657753825">I went looking to see what a Smores machine was, since<br/>
I had not heard of them.  I found discussion board<br/>
where they had been discussing them in December and I<br/>
thought it was funny enough to share.<br/>

from a distant planet, pob? allow me to explain what<br/>
smores are:<br/>
<br/>
* n., pl., american-canadian fireside treat,<br/>
popularized by the neo-nazi youth group, avante-garde<br/>
de la grande terror, cell 601 des jeunne fils. to<br/>
make: heat freon gas to 9000 degrees Fahrenheit, until<br/>
it&#39;s a gel, wh you spread upon asbestos-coated graham<br/>
crackers.<br/>
<br/>
* n., pl., opposite of &quot;mgonnavomit&quot;<br/>
<br/>
* n., pl., toast marshmallows (sweetened horse-hooves)<br/>
to a gentle brown, whoops, it&#39;s on fire, it&#39;s in my<br/>
hair, arghhh, place in between hershey bar and graham<br/>
cracker.<br/>

Gosh, Michael, couldna said it better myself, although<br/>
now I feel compelled to try. :) <br/>
<br/>
The late cartoonist Sandra Boynton once came up with a<br/>
version called &quot;Encores,&quot; which replaces the graham<br/>
crackers with Carr&#39;s digestive biscuits and the<br/>
Hershey bar with Toblerone. In theory this should be a<br/>
good thing, but digestive biscuits are freakin&#39; tiny,<br/>
and so molten marshmallow oozes all over your hand.<br/>
Meanwhile, the Toblerone is too thick to melt evenly<br/>
under the same molten marshmallow, so you have a big<br/>
chunk of unmelted Toblerone, which compromises the<br/>
structural integrity of the s&#39;more (sorry, encore). <br/>
<br/>
The bad news is that you are left grumpy, blistered<br/>
and snack fodder for any bear that smells the<br/>
chocolate. The good news is that nice medicinal shot<br/>
of bourbon (or six) works wonders as a mood elevator,<br/>
and will take your mind off the whole thing.<br/>
