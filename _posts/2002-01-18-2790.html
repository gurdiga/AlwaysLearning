Those in and of New Mexico cannot help but snort (if not guffaw or squeal) <br/>
when I say I went to Espanola Elementary, Espanola Jr. High and Espanola High <br/>
School.   Espanola is that town about which all jokes are customized.  In <br/>
Texas it&#39;s Aggies.  In New Mexico, it&#39;s &quot;There was this girl from Espanola...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When people say &quot;Do you like Espanola jokes?&quot; I sometimes say &quot;I *AM* an <br/>
Espanola joke!&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-534385427">Wow! Does that mean that all the rest of them are true? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
You guys, &quot;did you know&quot; was just meant for some laughs and maybe a few serious ponderings. I certainly didn&#39;t take all of those &quot;facts&quot; as face value. I got some laughs out of it and wanted to share it with you. That&#39;s all. :o)<br/>
