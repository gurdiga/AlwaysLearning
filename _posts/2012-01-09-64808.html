<div id="ygrps-yiv-94919047">I have four kids.  I breastfed all of them until about 2.  Right now I am<br/>
breastfeeding my 18 month old.  I was asked by my mom and my sil &quot;Are you<br/>
STILL breastfeeding?&quot; &quot;When are you going to stop&quot;  and that was it.  I<br/>
think it was all they said but it has been bothering me.  I didnt have a<br/>
reply to their comment.  I only said &quot;If I have another I probably wont<br/>
breastfeed but I cant have anymore kids&quot;... ( I said that because I think<br/>
breastfeeding is a commitment and I wouldnt just abruptly take away her<br/>
favorite thing)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ever since I was asked I have been having panic attacks.  I dont understand<br/>
why they asked me the question or what their hidden reasoning was.  I can<br/>
only assume that they think I am still breastfeeding for my own reasons not<br/>
because my baby wants to breastfeed.<br/>
<br/>
 I think it is such a personal matter.  I would never question another<br/>
mom&#39;s decisions on something like this.<br/>
<br/>
I have had some problems bonding with my 3 daughters because they had<br/>
terrible colic. I also had ppd.  I thought I was over it until this came up<br/>
and now Im starting to get depressed again.<br/>
<br/>
I know I should have more confidence and maybe I should go to some lll<br/>
meetings.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1936094414">Maybe they asked a question because they were interested in knowing the answer. Most women who nurse choose to ween their children earlier than 18 months. Perhaps they simply wondered why you choose to nurse longer. <br/>
<br/>
Does their opinion affect your desire to have that connection with your baby?<br/>
Even if the question was meant to be a criticism just remember that you nursing your child has very little to do with anyone but you and your child. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-358967594">Brandi I think that is is a good idea to go to some LaLeche Meetings.<br/>
<br/>
 If you have already breastfed the other three kids until they were 2 why are you feeling that way?<br/>
I have breastfed both my kids until they were 5. If asked  I would give one funny answer like:|<br/>
They will stop when they go to College<br/>
They will be done in  a couple of minutes <br/>
 Or get some ideas like from sites like this:<br/>
<br/>
 <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/criticism.html">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/criticism.html</a><br/>
<br/>
which has lots of awesome information and even funny comebacks on their links!<br/>
<br/>
 Why would a question from your mom and sister, of something you have already done  3 times, make you get depressed?|<br/>
If you are feeling depressed get some kind of help.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1905441420">Yes, Le Leche League would be wonderful for you. A group of women to support you and remind you of the so many great things of nursing. Maybe they are asking if you&#39;re still nursing because it has seemed like a long time to them, this being the 4th one and maybe you haven&#39;t really been able to stop in between children. I know many who are just amazed at that. i commend all mothers who have dedicated themselves so unselfishly<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-746521085">Well, I seem to be the only one, but my kids were always so demanding of my undivided attention (and, they never napped or slept longer than an hour at a time) that there was just no way I could ever attend a LLL meeting, which are always in the evenings where I am.  I nursed one child to 5 and the other to 3, when they self-weaned around the same time.  I read Mothering Your Nursing Toddler, a wonderful book by one of the LLL founders, when my oldest was 2 and I started to get &quot;the question&quot; from people around me.   I&#39;m surprised people don&#39;t recommend this lovely little book more often.  I&#39;m sure an LLL group in person can be a great experience for some people, but if that is not an option (or just not your thing), try that book instead.  One of the things I loved as a polite response, rather than the funny or off-the-cuff response, was (if your child is eating ANY solid foods) to just say, &quot;we are in the process of weaning&quot; - if your child is eating any solids, then technically, that is true.  You don&#39;t have to say how long it might take, and, it puts an end to the questions. :)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Definitely get yourself to some La Leche League meetings because you need to surround yourself with support, and that will be the best place to find support for nursing toddlers.<br/>
<br/>
But also because the leaders will be able to recommend resources for dealing with the postpartum depression. I think this is much more about the PPD than anything anyone said to you. (Not to diminish how comments like that can erode anyone&#39;s self confidence and resolve, however!)<br/>
<br/>
Most people don&#39;t know that PPD can be triggered by *any* hormonal shifts following the birth of a child and that can be as late as return of ovulation/menses or the start of weaning. So, if you haven&#39;t had your period since the birth of your child, maybe it&#39;s about to return. Or maybe your active toddler is suddenly nursing less and it&#39;s caused your hormones to dip/soar. Or maybe your PPD was never fully addressed 18 months ago and it&#39;s just been lying under the surface.<br/>
<br/>
You know logically you are doing what&#39;s best for you and your child -- you&#39;ve done it before! (-: Now you need to surround yourself with support and take care of your own health so that you can continue to be an amazing mother to your children.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1941608394">Ha! 18 months?  My nearly five year old still has the odd breastfeed when she&#39;s very tired.  My two year old feeds several times a day.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe they were just interested?  It seems odd that they&#39;d be critical if they know you&#39;ve already breastfed three children until they were two?  My dad would occasionally ask if I was going to wean Abi, especially when I was pregnant with Evie, but not in a nasty way, just because in his experience it is very unusual for women to breastfeed past 9 months or so.<br/>
<br/>
My standard answer to the &#39;how long?&#39; question is &#39;as long as she wants.&#39;. There aren&#39;t any further questions usually, but if there are I just shrug and say &#39;we&#39;ll see.&#39; <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in Australia and we have the Australian Breastfeeding Association which has great online forums for support as well as in person groups.  I&#39;m sure the LLL would be similar so I encourage you to access them, at least online.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and it&#39;s &#39;full-term&#39; not &#39;extended&#39; breastfeeding!  Just gives a different slant.<br/>

&gt; breastfeeding is a commitment and I wouldnt just abruptly take away her<br/>
&gt; favorite thing)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ever since I was asked I have been having panic attacks.  I dont understand<br/>
&gt; why they asked me the question or what their hidden reasoning was.  I can<br/>
&gt; only assume that they think I am still breastfeeding for my own reasons not<br/>
&gt; because my baby wants to breastfeed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  I think it is such a personal matter.  I would never question another<br/>
&gt; mom&#39;s decisions on something like this.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have had some problems bonding with my 3 daughters because they had<br/>
&gt; terrible colic. I also had ppd.  I thought I was over it until this came up<br/>
&gt; and now Im starting to get depressed again.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know I should have more confidence and maybe I should go to some lll<br/>
&gt; meetings.<br/>

Could it be they thought you seemed tired or depressed and thought they were suggesting a way you might help yourself?  <br/>
<br/>
It’s ok to say, “Why are you asking?”  if you need clarification.    It’s ok to say, “I’d rather not discuss something so personal with you.”     It might seem awkward in the moment but it’s not at all as uncomfortable as wondering for days what their motives were, what their expectation is, what image you’re projecting, etc. <br/>
<br/>
If you intend to breastfeed your baby until she’s two you can say that.   If you intend to let the baby decide when you’re done you can say that.   <br/>
<br/>
Nothing they think or say has to have any special power over you or your choices.  But you know that.   <br/>
<br/>
I hope your nice baby and that close and sweet (and fleeting) time with her is helping you feel better today. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1128529805">-=- but my kids were always so demanding of my undivided attention (and, they never napped or slept longer than an hour at a time) that there was just no way I could ever attend a LLL meeting, which are always in the evenings where I am.-=-<br/>
<br/>
In my experience, the evening meetings are designed so the dad or grandmother or friend might be able to take care of the older kids and the mom can take the nursling.<br/>
