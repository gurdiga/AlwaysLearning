<div id="ygrps-yiv-400196003">My family is nutty!  Yesterday I talked to my newly-married sister.  <br/>
She and her husband are doing serious family planning, making a will <br/>
and all that, so she wanted to ask me if I would agree to care for <br/>
her future children in the event that anything happened to her and <br/>
her husband, but she added, in the same breath, <br/>
&quot;But they have to go to regular school.&quot;   !!!<br/>
<br/>
Ha !  I don&#39;t know if I should be flattered or offended.  Actually, <br/>
I am neither.  I just think it&#39;s hilarious.  I keep laughing every <br/>
time I think about it.  Let&#39;s see, We trust you with the life of our <br/>
kids, but not with their education.    Hee hee hee.  I am still <br/>
cracking up.  <br/>
