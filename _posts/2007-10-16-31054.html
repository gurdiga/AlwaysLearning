control things such as tv, food, bedtimes, etc, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
Why do people justify this soooo heartily and still consider themselves <br/>
to be unschooling.  I just don&#39;t see it being very compatible in the <br/>
face of having a partnership based relationship with ones kids.</div>

<br/>
Priorities and principles.<br/>
<br/>
People can unschool without going into all areas of their lives.   <br/>
I&#39;ve never known a family doing that to be as happy as ours or some  <br/>
of the other enthusiastic unschoolers I know.  I&#39;ve never seen a  <br/>
family like that where the parents don&#39;t share in the explorations  <br/>
and the learning has as much in-depth involvement with their kids.<br/>
<br/>
The time they spend pressing, avoiding, justifying, discussing,  <br/>
pleading, threatening and being generally at adds about TV, food,  <br/>
bedtimes, computer use, video games, room cleaning, etc., could have  <br/>
been put to much better, warmer, loving use with better longterm  <br/>
results.<br/>
<br/>
Marty&#39;s downstairs cleaning his room.  I don&#39;t know why.  It was a  <br/>
mess, no one said anything, and he&#39;s straightening it up extremely.    <br/>
Holly&#39;s asleep.  (For the record; they&#39;re not both being impressively  <br/>
industrious at the same time.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think if parents indicate that kids can&#39;t learn practical things in  <br/>
the same way they learn &quot;academic&quot; things, the parents don&#39;t have as  <br/>
much faith in learning as they could have.  That doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re  <br/>
not unschooling, it just means they&#39;re doing it in a limited way,  <br/>
seeing it still as the &quot;school&quot; part of life rather than as learning  <br/>
in and from and through life.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I just wrote a long sort of rant about all this on my blog because it <br/>
was boiling up inside of me and I needed to get it out.  I don&#39;t like <br/>
things like that to irritate me, yet I run into it all the time, so <br/>
I&#39;ve been trying to understand where people are coming from with this <br/>
need to control.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t feel this need to control.  I haven&#39;t for a very long time, <br/>
although in the beginning there were areas that I needed to work on.  <br/>
However, I didn&#39;t feel like I had to justify that need, I felt like I <br/>
needed to analyze it and find a way to get rid of it in my life and the <br/>
life of my kids.  I find it really difficult in that light, to hear <br/>
others doing all that justification of control, when I see very clearly <br/>
that it doesn&#39;t work well.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t always been able to articulate that, but lately I&#39;ve been <br/>
doing that, writing about it and trying to articulate that idea, that <br/>
I&#39;ve been practicing and believing and seeing firsthand in my own life, <br/>
but seeing that others don&#39;t do that too and have many justifications <br/>
for that need to control.  (okay so that long sentence wasn&#39;t so <br/>
articulate ;)  )<br/>
<br/>
I wrote something about that idea of taking kids out of the school box <br/>
and then bringing them home and putting the kids in a whole other sort <br/>
of box of &quot;can&#39;t&quot;, &quot;shouldn&#39;t&quot;, and &quot;for your own good&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
It really gets under my skin for some reason when other people say that <br/>
just because they don&#39;t follow all the tennets of unschooling that they <br/>
aren&#39;t unschooling.  I don&#39;t get that at all.  What tennets?  If <br/>
control based relationships work for them, then I digress, but I really <br/>
don&#39;t see how it can help someone unschool with their kids.</div>

<br/>
That they are still or that they aren&#39;t?  (I got confused. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
I believe if someone provides lots of academic opportunities and  <br/>
materials for their children but they don&#39;t have lessons or a  <br/>
curriculum, and if the parents keep it interesting and going, and the  <br/>
kids are into it, they might successfully unschool without doing  <br/>
anything except just those academics.  They might even do it six  <br/>
hours a day, 180 days a week.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t want them to come here and help the unschoolers who come  <br/>
to this list, though, because their help would be &quot;getting colder&quot;  <br/>
instead of &quot;getting warmer&quot; on the hints scale.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That they can unschool and not follow all the &quot;tennents&quot; of <br/>
unschooling.  If by, tennents they mean controlling/not controlling <br/>
aspects of their childrens lives.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen parents doing all sorts of cool things with their kids <br/>
and still controlling their childrens bedtimes, etc.  I&#39;ve even seen <br/>
moms and daughters having good relationships even with that kind of <br/>
control.  I personally don&#39;t see it being benificial to the kind of <br/>
relationship that I have and want more of with my own children.<br/>
<br/>
You are right that it is &quot;colder&quot; rather than &quot;warmer&quot;.  If you build <br/>
a relationship based in trusting kids to learn what and when, then it <br/>
stands to reason that building that same kind of relationship in <br/>
other areas of life would follow.  Right now, I&#39;m anxious to leave <br/>
the house, but one of my kids isn&#39;t, she wants to go just not this <br/>
instant, so I&#39;m waiting patiently to go out, while the other daughter <br/>
is watching tv waiting with me.  <br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s my timetable, I get to say when and for how long.  When it&#39;s <br/>
OUR timetable, we work through everyone&#39;s needs.  I don&#39;t need to go <br/>
right this minute, it would be nice to not have to navigate the <br/>
beginning of rush hour, but I can just make it be the &quot;cool, longer <br/>
time in the car to talk and listen to music, while getting to our <br/>
destination&quot;.  My other daughter is happily watching tv, she got <br/>
herself dressed and ready and will still be ready 1/2 and hour from <br/>
now.  She&#39;s also using this time to gather up loose change to spend <br/>
while out and about.  I could ruin this time by trying to control the <br/>
time we leave the house because I want to leave now.</div>
