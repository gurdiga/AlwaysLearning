<div id="ygrps-yiv-1858504608">&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve been gently mentioning the unschooling<br/>
philosophies to my family and in-laws.  I can see the<br/>
consternation and confusion, but they let it slide. <br/>
However, I know that when they find out what I&#39;m<br/>
attempting with the eating, no words will be spared. <br/>
Can you help me prepare my defense ahead of time?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I just got a book from the library today.  I haven&#39;t<br/>
read it yet, but my dh has started it.  He says I need<br/>
to read it before Saturday - when my parents are<br/>
coming to visit.  He says the book is perfect.  I&#39;ll<br/>
let you know what I think after I read it....<br/>

Haden Elgin<br/>
<br/>
And yes, I agree it really isn&#39;t any of their<br/>
business.  But they are my parents & I would like to<br/>
keep some kind of decent relationship with them.  It<br/>
helps that they live in Alabama & we are in Arizona<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1842064856">&lt;&lt;Heather, maybe you could ask your mom to put her<br/>
concerns in writing so you can really think about<br/>
them, later on.<br/>
<br/>
Probably she never will.<br/>
<br/>
If she does, just the act of writing them down will<br/>
help her clarify her own thinking.<br/>
<br/>
If she refuses, you could claim if it&#39;s not important<br/>
enough to put in writing, it must not be very<br/>
important.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
That is a great idea!  Thanks.  I think she probably<br/>
would write them down, but it would take the issue out<br/>
of the immediate (hopefully) and emotional.<br/>

<br/>
Even if she doesn&#39;t, it&#39;s another of those stalling and &quot;back off&quot; tactics <br/>
like &quot;After you&#39;ve read this book.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You can say &quot;I will read your opinion in writing,&quot; and every time she starts <br/>
to discuss,  hold up your hand and say &quot;In writing, please.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If she DOES read a book or write out her concerns, you TOTALLY win!  And if <br/>
she doesn&#39;t,  you get a reprieve.<br/>
