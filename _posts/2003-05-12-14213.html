<br/>
  Oh, I confess. For all my bravado, I&#39;ve never done acid either. Or shrooms. <br/>
  Tried pot once after college and almost choked on the smoke. And I went to a <br/>
  hippy college where there were plenty of drugs. <br/>
<br/>
  In Junior high I even tried to start an anti-drug group. Someone once <br/>
  described me as being like &quot;Someone who&#39;d Lost a Friend to drugs.&quot; (This was <br/>
  not said in a loving, compassionate tone.) My goodness, what a good girl I <br/>
  was! <br/>
<br/>
  Now, of course, I see the anti-pot commercials on tv (Gee...who <br/>
  knew...marijauna will make your 14 year old get pregnant!) and see the <br/>
  results of the &quot;drug war,&quot; and I&#39;ve lightened up considerably. Everytime I <br/>
  see one of them I just want to offer my kid a joint.<br/>
<br/>
  (No, not really, in case you managed to miss that I&#39;m kidding. Put the phone <br/>
  down. Calling Child Protective will really not help anything.)<br/>

need to be safe, or they need to make sure their chidlren are safe if <br/>
they are going to do something risky like breaking the law, even though <br/>
pot should nto be illegal.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Oh, I confess. For all my bravado, I&#39;ve never done acid either. Or <br/>

&gt;   Tried pot once after college and almost choked on the smoke. And I <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;   In Junior high I even tried to start an anti-drug group. Someone once<br/>
&gt;   described me as being like &quot;Someone who&#39;d Lost a Friend to drugs.&quot; <br/>

&gt;   not said in a loving, compassionate tone.) My goodness, what a good <br/>
&gt; girl I<br/>
&gt;   was!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Now, of course, I see the anti-pot commercials on tv (Gee...who<br/>
&gt;   knew...marijauna will make your 14 year old get pregnant!) and see the<br/>
&gt;   results of the &quot;drug war,&quot; and I&#39;ve lightened up considerably. <br/>
&gt; Everytime I<br/>

  KNEW that the child was easy to take...<br/>
<br/>
  I think that parents need to put aside their needs for their children&#39;s <br/>
  need to be safe, or they need to make sure their chidlren are safe if <br/>
  they are going to do something risky like breaking the law, even though <br/>
  pot should nto be illegal.<br/>
<br/>
  For instance, if I was going to have an all out party where people would <br/>
  get drunk and such, I would have my kids spend the night elsewhere.<br/>

  &gt; well, I forget.<br/>
  &gt; Personally I like drugs. I esp. like pot. Much safer & saner than alcohol.<br/>

  &gt;   &gt; I should say for the record, I&#39;ve never dropped acid.  But I could <br/>
  &gt; talk<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; aobut shrooms.<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;   Oh, I confess. For all my bravado, I&#39;ve never done acid either. Or <br/>
  &gt; shrooms.<br/>
  &gt;   Tried pot once after college and almost choked on the smoke. And I <br/>
  &gt; went to a<br/>
  &gt;   hippy college where there were plenty of drugs.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;   In Junior high I even tried to start an anti-drug group. Someone once<br/>
  &gt;   described me as being like &quot;Someone who&#39;d Lost a Friend to drugs.&quot; <br/>
  &gt; (This was<br/>
  &gt;   not said in a loving, compassionate tone.) My goodness, what a good <br/>
  &gt; girl I<br/>
  &gt;   was!<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;   Now, of course, I see the anti-pot commercials on tv (Gee...who<br/>
  &gt;   knew...marijauna will make your 14 year old get pregnant!) and see the<br/>
  &gt;   results of the &quot;drug war,&quot; and I&#39;ve lightened up considerably. <br/>
  &gt; Everytime I<br/>
  &gt;   see one of them I just want to offer my kid a joint.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;   (No, not really, in case you managed to miss that I&#39;m kidding. Put <br/>
  &gt; the phone<br/>
  &gt;   down. Calling Child Protective will really not help anything.)<br/>

influence from the alcohol folks, and there was a certain amount of racism<br/>
involved.  At that time, the majority of marijuana users were either black<br/>
or chicano.<br/>
<br/>
This recent banning of hemp was just that, hemp, with a few parts per<br/>
million of THC but all kinds of other good, healthy stuff.  There&#39;s a whole<br/>
hemp industry up here in Canada producing edible oil products skin products,<br/>
fiber for clothing, etc.  That&#39;s just been banned in your country.<br/>

solve a problem doesn&#39;t work, it won&#39;t help to try more of the same? (badly<br/>
paraphrased)  It seems to me that every time they crank the drug war up a<br/>
notch, drug use increases.  If what they really wanted to do was stop the<br/>
*drug problem* they&#39;d be re-thinking their approach and trying something<br/>
different.  It&#39;s pretty obvious that the problem is getting worse rather<br/>
than better, so you wonder just what the *real* reasons for the war on drugs<br/>
are.  And now they&#39;re threatening us with all kinds of border and trade<br/>
problems because Canada is going to decriminalize pot possession.  It&#39;s<br/>
getting scary living next door to the only &quot;superpower&quot; in the world.<br/>
