<div id="ygrps-yiv-867196464">Well, we waited in line for 30 minutes tonight for this long awaited X-Box  <br/>
game.  The boys have been excited all day waiting for midnight.  They  were the <br/>
youngest people in line tonight.  Other kids their age, I am sure,  were home <br/>
in bed because tomorrow is a school day.  I was the only  woman.  I am sure <br/>
we got more than a couple of glances from the mostly  18-25 year old men in <br/>
line.  <br/>
 <br/>
The boys were just so excited.  They have been talking all day about  what <br/>
they hope is in the game.  And my oldest read aloud from the strategy  guide to <br/>
his younger brother all the way home.  Now they are all hooked up  and playing <br/>
the game, probably will be for a few hours yet.  It is so nice  to see them <br/>
so happy and excited about something.  The anticipation, the  whole experience.<br/>

Great day!<br/>

<br/>
My son was also the youngest in line last night. He&#39;s been having a <br/>
great time playing it all day today. Do you think your boys would <br/>
like to play together with mine?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1699780802">My son has just found Halo in the last week.  We have a PS2 and a Gamecube, so we never had the Halo experience before.  :)  Well,,, end of that after he played a demo of Halo 2 at Gamestop last week.  He is now asking for money or gift cards for Christmas to Gamestop.  So he can buy a used X-box and with it you get Halo!   Then he&#39;s going to buy Halo 2 also, or we&#39;ll get it for him for Christmas. <br/>
 <br/>
He&#39;s been playing the online demo version and having a blast,   so has his sister.<br/>
 <br/>
It looks pretty fun,  I havn&#39;t played yet.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
We also get some looks from people when we&#39;re in the gaming shops,  the guys working always ask me, &quot;you&#39;re their mom?&quot;  &quot;You like gaming?&quot;  I love talking with the people working at these shops,  they are so into their jobs.  We don&#39;t see that very much at other places.<br/>
 <br/>
After he gets the X-box, I might have to check out Fable, that looks cool too. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 <br/>
Another place where people are shocked is at Game Shop.  That is a  store <br/>
where they sell the table top gaming stuff.  With the little  figures.  When we <br/>
went to the first Live and Learn Conference they had Mage  Knights on the table <br/>
for raffle and both of my boys won a set.  After that  we explored getting <br/>
more and found Warhammer 40,000.  Those tiny figures  you have to put together <br/>
and paint yourself.  Well, the boys and I were  hooked.  <br/>
 <br/>
But we always get the same thing from customers there, when I start asking  <br/>
questions and they find out that I help my boys put them together and paint <br/>
them  and I actually play the game.  They are amazed.  I get the &quot;you&#39;re  their <br/>
Mom?&quot; questions.  The staff are really helpful, and they know us  now.  But <br/>
they are amazed that a Mom would not only allow that sort of  purchasing and play <br/>
but would actually be a participant with their  children.  <br/>
 <br/>
Maybe when those young men at the store have kids of their own they will  <br/>
look back and see there is another option then what society has said is  <br/>
acceptable for parenting.<br/>

Yes!   This is what keeps me going some days,  we don&#39;t know any other unschoolers in our area.  So it gets a little rough sometimes.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just beginning to go into some detail of our life learning with some of them.  After several visits and comments from them.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Well, we waited in line for 30 minutes tonight for this long awaited X-Box <br/>
 <br/>
game.  The boys have been excited all day waiting for midnight.  They  were <br/>
the <br/>
youngest people in line tonight.  Other kids their age, I am sure,  were home <br/>
in bed because tomorrow is a school day.  I was the only  woman.  I am sure <br/>
we got more than a couple of glances from the mostly  18-25 year old men in <br/>
line.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Kirby had ordered one, but he&#39;s out of town.  So he and Marty went a few days <br/>
ago and switched the receipt to Marty&#39;s name.  But Marty&#39;s not old enough to <br/>
pick it up, so I would have to go.<br/>
<br/>
Last night was the big night.  <br/>
<br/>
Four extra boys were here.  One had ordered his own copy, from another store.<br/>
<br/>
They got two TVs set up in the library, and two x-boxes, by 10:00.<br/>
With two hours to wait, they wanted to pick up another game to play in the <br/>
meantime, so went to Joey&#39;s brother-in-law&#39;s house.  His sister is in NYC and <br/>
had called and reported that a store in NYC had a line that went TWICE around <br/>
the block.   It was only a few days ago that Keith had been telling Marty and <br/>
Holly how big the blocks in New York City are.  Quickly made connection for <br/>
Marty!<br/>
<br/>
Three kids went to get Brett&#39;s.  Four (with Holly) went with me to get <br/>
Marty&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
At midnight there were about 50 people in line.  Some, like our group, were <br/>
two or more to pick up a single game.   They split the line into those who had <br/>
fully pre-paid, and those who had just paid a deposit, so one line was going <br/>
faster.  Kirby had a pre-paid deluxe (in a metal box, with something else in <br/>
there, maybe a red vs. blue episode?).<br/>
<br/>
It took a half an hour for Marty to get through the line.  We were back at <br/>
12:40 a.m. and he called Brett to see how that line was.  Brett was still in <br/>
line at the mall.  About 100 people in line, he said.   I went to bed before <br/>
learning what time they arrived.<br/>
<br/>
Ours came from a strip mall not far from us, at GamePro at Juan Tabo and <br/>
Menaul (for those who want to picture this &lt;g&gt;) and the line went past the Keva <br/>
Juice, which was closed.  I was thinking they missed their bet, but then again <br/>
these folks might not have been able to afford a $3 energy organic grass juice <br/>
drink.   Inside the store they were offering free miniature sodas (those <br/>
half-sized cans), but people were too excited to want any, it seemed.  The game was <br/>
playing on a demo, but nobody was playing it.  They didn&#39;t want to do <br/>
anything but get their own copy and go home.<br/>
<br/>
When we first pulled in I drove by the line and Holly said &quot;Look at all those <br/>
lonely boys.&quot;<br/>
I let them all out at the end of the line, and went to park where I could <br/>
watch the line so i didn&#39;t have to stand in the cold before I was really needed.  <br/>
I was thinking &quot;Look at all those future engineers and managers; that&#39;s where <br/>
the girls ought to look for a boyfriend.&quot;   I said it to Marty when we were <br/>
inside the store and the other three were waiting outside.   Some seemed <br/>
musicianish, too (a bonus, in my mind).   These were the geeks who <br/>
--planned ahead<br/>
--could show up on time<br/>
--had $60<br/>
<br/>
Not lonely losers.  Organized and dedicated gamers.<br/>
<br/>
There were younger kids than Holly there, and I said, &quot;These can&#39;t all be <br/>
homeschoolers!  I guess a lot of people are going to miss school tomorrow.&quot;  One <br/>
of the employees, who was jollying the people in line said he had heard some <br/>
people say they were taking the rest of the week off, some from school, some <br/>
from work.  They used it like a vacation.<br/>
<br/>
I asked him if he remembered the origins of this midnight pick-up thing, and <br/>
he didn&#39;t.  I speculated it might be caused by 24-hour Walmarts.  Marty said <br/>
it had been happening with movie releases, midnight showings, for several <br/>
years.   I said Harry Potter books were the first I remembered.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else here know?<br/>
<br/>
In towns without 24-hour Walmarts, do people just wait until morning to buy <br/>
their exciting new releases?<br/>
<br/>
Nobody showed up there to buy one who didn&#39;t have a reserved copy, they said. <br/>
  <br/>
Someone else complained that it was $5 less at Walmart, and he had told them <br/>
yes, but Walmart didn&#39;t take advance orders and they were going to run out.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s an interesting phenomenon, though, for absolute sure.  So we&#39;re not the <br/>
only people accepting of and encouraging of game playing.<br/>
<br/>
Another mistake, maybe, that the store made was not having the X-box controls <br/>
right by the line.  The line was passing by Playstation supplies, and X-box <br/>
was across the room.  They had taken out all their floor displays (used dvds <br/>
and such) partly to allow room for a line, and probably to avoid theft.  A store <br/>
usually full of cluttery stuff had a fully empty center space, with just wall <br/>
displays.<br/>
<br/>
Michael McCantz, another homeschooler we&#39;ve known for years,  now 18 or 19, <br/>
arrived and ceremoniously departed the back door of the little RV his mom <br/>
drives around.  He was wearing  a long coat and cool hat, and had a friend with <br/>
him.  Typical Michael style.  I spoke to him when I came out to join the line, <br/>
and then he saw Holly and talked to her about her green hair, and talked to <br/>
Marty some.<br/>
<br/>
It was an event.<br/>
<br/>
Friday night there&#39;s a party here, and I expect they might get 12 to 16 <br/>
players going at once.  I only found out last night that Kirby had been inviting <br/>
people over , but I don&#39;t mind.  He&#39;s gone until Thursday.<br/>

The guy at GamePro last night said something about usually Kirby was waiting <br/>
on him.  (He knew it was Marty, but Kirby wasn&#39;t there.)<br/>
<br/>
I see that joy-of-job in Kirby and the others he works with too.  They really <br/>
CARE about the cards and miniatures and games.  They love them.  They know <br/>
what&#39;s coming out when not because they have briefings, but because they would <br/>
know probably have researched and known anyway even if they didn&#39;t work there.  <br/>
But they&#39;re extra happy to be in the know and in the flow.<br/>

The Sony PS2 can play online too but not sure what it involves. I&#39;m<br/>

<br/>
To be able to play Halo 2 online you need to buy a kit called Xbox <br/>
Live and connect it to your broadband modem at 512KB speed. If your <br/>
internet speed is less than this it won&#39;t work properly because it&#39;s <br/>
very slow and freezes during the game. Hope that helps.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers, Lisa<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-473469920">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;For Xbox there is a program called Live something?? Can&#39;t remember the<br/>
complete name but it&#39;s a program you buy and set up then you hook the<br/>
system up to your internet connection and it allows the players to<br/>
play each other. <br/>
<br/>
The Sony PS2 can play online too but not sure what it involves. I&#39;m<br/>
sure if you google it you can find out more. <br/>
<br/>
For xmas I&#39;m getting ds the xbox live thingy. He&#39;s going to do the<br/>
connecting, he said it&#39;s as simple as adding another tv to your cable<br/>
line. So we&#39;ll see.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He is right - it is very simple to set up X-box Live. We have it, and<br/>
sometimes dh just leaves it on and his machine acts as a server for other<br/>
online players. In our case the X-box, which has its own IP number, does not<br/>
interfere with our cable modem or download speeds in any way.<br/>
<br/>
There are a number of different games that are configured for live play. I<br/>
know that dh plays a couple of different role playing fighting games, as<br/>
well as at least one car racing game. I think it will say so on the package.<br/>
Part of the equipment is a headset with microphone so that you can talk to<br/>
each other. Sometimes there is team play.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1077609607">My son hasn&#39;t shown much interest in muli-player playing but in doing the<br/>
research for it, the guys in the shop at work (who borrowed every lick<br/>
networking hardware I had so they could have a halo 2 party with 11 xbox set<br/>
ups) said that there is a program called Xbox Connect [www.xbconnect.com]<br/>
that allows you to play on line and host games without the monthly charges<br/>
that Xbox live has. Unfortunately you still need a broadband connection. If<br/>
you have a Mac, the program to use is: Aquaduct 2<br/>
