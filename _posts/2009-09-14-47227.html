<div id="ygrps-yiv-1301392794">Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
Just read an interesting item at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/138/who-needs-harvard.html?page=0%2C0">http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/138/who-needs-harvard.html?page=0%2C0</a>  &quot;How Web-Savvy Edupunks Are Transforming American Higher Education&quot;   Sounds like a move toward unschooling university - what a nice thought.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of quotes:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The transformation of education may happen faster than we realize. However futuristic it may seem, what we&#39;re living through is an echo of the university&#39;s earliest history. Universitas doesn&#39;t mean campus, or class, or a particular body of knowledge; it means the guild, the group of people united in scholarship. ...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Today, we&#39;ve gone from scarcity of knowledge to unimaginable abundance. It&#39;s only natural that these new, rapidly evolving information technologies would convene new communities of scholars, both inside and outside existing institutions. The string-quartet model of education is no longer sustainable. The university of the future can&#39;t be far away.&quot;<br/>
