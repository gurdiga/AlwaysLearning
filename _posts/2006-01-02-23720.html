<div id="ygrps-yiv-1874038465">I was thinking in terms of controlling my temper. I can get frustrated, irritated, etc, but I <br/>
don&#39;t have to let it run my day. I can choose to be happy, I can choose to yell, I can choose <br/>
to laugh, or I can choose to pout. It is beneficial to me, because it reminds me that I <br/>
always have a choice in how to react to my kids. That was the context that the author was <br/>
speaking in as well, in &#39;A Covenant Marriage&#39;, in regards to how we treat our spouses. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a recovering anger addict...most of it in relation to my childhood. I wish I would have <br/>
resolved those issues BC (before children) but I didn&#39;t. I didn&#39;t realize I had those issues til <br/>
I had children. Now we&#39;re working on it together. Often people who yell (me) feel that they <br/>
are in control, they don&#39;t even realize that they&#39;ve lost control because as a child, they <br/>
knew that the adults that yelled at them had control. <br/>
<br/>
Even more reason for me to be a better parent than the example I grew up with. I had no <br/>
good examples. <br/>

I never thought of it that way.  How true.<br/>
When I lose my temper, Kirby (my oldest) looks at me in a way that  <br/>
lets me know I&#39;m not coming across as clever and sensible at ALL.   <br/>
He&#39;s like a mirror in which I look like an idiot, sometimes.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Maybe letting immature feelings and desires control one&#39;s life is a  <br/>
bad thing. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
On the other hand, my children&#39;s feelings and desires have had lots  <br/>
of effect on their own lives and mine, and their dads, and they were  <br/>
pretty immature.    They&#39;re more mature now, I believe, directly  <br/>
because we  assisted them in feeling and responding to their desires  <br/>
and feelings.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s immature for me to feel that I would like to make  <br/>
my children&#39;s lives better.  Maybe it&#39;s past &quot;a feeling&quot; at that  <br/>
point, and on to explainable logic.  Maybe not.  I have the desire to  <br/>
read and write about unschooling every day.  I do it because I want  <br/>
to, because it feels good but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s an immature thing to  <br/>
avoid.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like the quote.  Maybe I just don&#39;t get it, but it seems to  <br/>
negate feelings and desires.  Even the Dalai Lama has feelings and  <br/>
desires, I bet.  I bet the Pope has feelings and desires.   Even  <br/>
Jimmy Carter has.<br/>
