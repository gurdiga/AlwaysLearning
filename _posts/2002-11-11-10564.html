I&#39;d have taken her into the store and bought her a cold 6-pack of cola all <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1837781868">As you all know, I&#39;m a Camp Fire leader.  We&#39;re in the middle of our candy <br/>
sale fundraiser, and we&#39;re doing it via site-sales at the local Lowe&#39;s.  It <br/>
works pretty well.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is one of the kids took a dollar out of the till.  Her cousin saw <br/>
her put her hand in the box (he had his hand in the box, too); I was standing <br/>
right there, tho I didn&#39;t see her take it, next thing I see is her sticking a <br/>
dollar into a coke machine.  Her cousin loudly confronted her and she denied <br/>
(she&#39;s 9, he&#39;s 8).  She got her coke.  When I finally got all the money <br/>
counted at home today, of course, I was a dollar short.<br/>
<br/>
I was calm about it at the time, tried to let it go and get on the with the <br/>
sale.  But I did quietly and without threat inform her that I would be able <br/>
to know if a dollar was missing as soon as I counted the money.  (The <br/>
conversation was complicated by the bossiness of the 8 yo towards his cousin, <br/>
so I didn&#39;t have much choice but to let it go at that time, else it would <br/>
escalate.)<br/>
<br/>
Now that I know for sure that she took the dollar, I&#39;m considering what to do <br/>
about.  It&#39;s not like it broke the bank, of course.  We received $40 in <br/>
donations alone that day, so the $1 for candy money can be made up out of <br/>
that.  It&#39;s the fact that she thought the money was hers to take.  I keep <br/>
trying to see it from her point of view.  Not the best circumstances at home; <br/>
her grandmother brings her, her cousin and her sister to Camp Fire because <br/>
the parents won&#39;t; they&#39;re working the candy sale to pay for their $15 <br/>
registration, and they&#39;ve been on scholarship before that.  The two girls are <br/>
a real pain to deal with anyway, but we perservere.  My mother wisely <br/>
reminded me that honesty is a virtue even the poor should hold.  <br/>
<br/>
I hate this part of me that seems to want to make excuses for her and let it <br/>
go.  But what am I teaching her as her CF leader if I do?  Shouldn&#39;t I at <br/>
least try to make the point to her, without shaming or embarrassing her?  <br/>
Shouldn&#39;t she be expected to give the money back?  How will I even get her to <br/>
admit that she took it?  <br/>
<br/>
Part of the Camp Fire Law is &quot;Be trustworthy&quot;, so I suspect we&#39;ll be working <br/>
on that at our next meeting.  But what else?  Ideas on how to handle the <br/>
girl?  Ideas on games I can play re: trust/honesty/etc.?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s a great Langston Hughes story called &quot;Thank You, M&#39;am&quot; about a boy <br/>
who tries to steal a purse from a lady who catches him, brings him home for a <br/>
meal, lectures him on honesty, then gives him money to buy the shoes he wants <br/>
(not necessary shoes, blue suede shoes.) Maybe you could tell the girl that <br/>
if she needs a dollar for something she could just ask you for one. If the <br/>
home situation were better, I&#39;d want to tell them, but you know best how to <br/>
handle that part.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Be trustworthy&quot; or what?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the next time she&#39;s where a money box is, you can just say (quietly) <br/>
that you don&#39;t want her dealing with the money because she needs to re-earn <br/>
your trust.  Or in a more positive way, give your best members the special <br/>
privilege of giving change.   (The bad thing about that is if someone buys <br/>
something from her and she&#39;s not allowed to put it in the box, it&#39;s in her <br/>
hand longer and...<br/>
<br/>
Or you could ask casually if she has any money early in the day, and if she&#39;s <br/>
sticking a dollar in a coke maching later you can say &quot;I thought you didn&#39;t <br/>
have any money.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
With my boys I remind them if they&#39;re not honest people won&#39;t believe them <br/>
even when they are telling the truth.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a hard one.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, and I&#39;ve done that with my own children, or pointed it out to them.  <br/>
For some reason that wasn&#39;t in my mind that day.<br/>
<br/>
If the <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; handle that part.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The grandmother returned shortly after, while the girl was sticking the <br/>
dollar in the coke machine.  Grandmother was sure she took it (apparently <br/>
it&#39;s a pattern), and was angry, but was willing to let it go since Bossy was <br/>
involved.  I&#39;m sure she didn&#39;t want to give Bossy more ammo.  I&#39;m certain <br/>
that when my co-leader calls Grandmother today to discuss it, it will be hard <br/>
to keep her from over-reacting.  I want the girl to learn the lesson, not be <br/>
spanked, and I&#39;d really like her to see that there are adults, at Camp Fire <br/>
at least, who respect her and care for her, and want to appeal to the best <br/>
parts of her.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to see if I can find that story.  Thanks, Paula!<br/>

grandmother/parents are not the way to go, why not try letting her earn the<br/>
dollar from you in some way? You can say, I know this is how you bought that<br/>
coke, now I want you to _______________________ to earn that money that I had<br/>
to replace for the fund. This lets her win back your respect and at the same<br/>
time lets her know that she didn&#39;t get away with it. Who knows what goes on at<br/>
home? She might see people stealing all the time, it isn&#39;t unusual for parents<br/>
with no ethics to expect their children to somehow exhibit them. <br/>
<br/>
If it happens again or other kinds of trigger behaviors, it might be a real<br/>
sign of something serious going on in that girl&#39;s home life.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>

could learn, if she was hanging out at my house and around me more than a <br/>
couple of hours every 2 weeks, that she can have anything I am able to give <br/>
her.  But I only have a little time, and I think the temporary gluttony that <br/>
would result from that policy would break the bank.  <br/>

for the memory of the incident to fade somewhat, and for her grandmother to <br/>
step up (which she didn&#39;t), before buying her a coke with my own money.  She <br/>
talked about how thirsty she was, in between sales.  It was hard for me not <br/>
to just buy her a coke right away, but dang it--it&#39;s not my responsibility to <br/>
do so.  But from now on, I&#39;ll be bringing water or lemonade and some crackers <br/>
or something, paid for with Camp Fire money.  <br/>
