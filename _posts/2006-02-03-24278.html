<div id="ygrps-yiv-911243620">Hi Joanna! I thought I would just share our families arrangements, not that<br/>
they are working so wonderfully or anything. My dh couldn&#39;t stand sleeping<br/>
in the same room as the kids, they were too noisy for him to sleep and so at<br/>
about 6 weeks old me and the twins got booted out of the room into the<br/>
livingroom/couch. I did not like that one bit but it made sense at the time,<br/>
so I can sort of relate to husbands that have been booted out of their<br/>
bedrooms. When we moved when the kids were 7 months old we set up 2<br/>
bedrooms, 1 for me and the twins and 1 for my dh. He has tried to move into<br/>
our room several times over the past 2 years but just cannot sleep thru the<br/>
kids noises. Now, I find this hilarious b/c my dh is the LOUDEST snorer in<br/>
the known universe and I had slept thru his snoring for 5 years before the<br/>
birth of our children. Now he has a cpap machine and I simply cannot sleep<br/>
thru the sound of that machine. Go figure. I miss being able to just snuggle<br/>
with him in our bed. Other than that, our sleeping arrangements have worked<br/>
out fine up until now. My son was starting to move around so badly and sleep<br/>
literally on top of my head and so I have started to transition him into a<br/>
toddler bed smack up against the side of our king size bed and he usually<br/>
sleeps thru the night in his little toddler bed. But, my dd is still very<br/>
very needy to sleep in the big bed with mommy and there would be no way I<br/>
could just kick her out. We have all had a bit of a stomach bug for the past<br/>
week and I guess my son didn&#39;t feel well in the middle of the night. I was<br/>
working in my office across the hall and he got out of bed to go looking for<br/>
me and ended up stopping and falling asleep in our dog&#39;s bed at the foot of<br/>
our big bed in the bedroom, which is also smack up against the kingsize<br/>
family bed. When I went in to go to sleep and saw my baby boy sleeping 1/2<br/>
on the floor/1/2 on the dog&#39;s bed my heart just died a thousand deaths. OMG,<br/>
I thought, I have kicked the poor child out of our bed and he needs a warm<br/>
body so badly that he went to sleep with the dog!! Now, we love our Penelope<br/>
(our boxer) and she is definitely my first child, but, there is no way I<br/>
would make my kid sleep with the dog instead of in our big bed. So, I<br/>
scooped up the child and held him all night long in our big bed like old<br/>
times and it is just so sweet to breathe in the breath of a sleeping child.<br/>
I cannot figure out for the life of me why so many husbands don&#39;t realize<br/>
how precious this time is. Soon enough they will be, like, don&#39;t kiss me<br/>
mom, drop me off at the corner so no one sees me get out of the car mom,<br/>
stuff like that. Now they want me to hold them and kiss them and snuggle all<br/>
night long and it is just so precious. Yeah, except when he kicks and rolls<br/>
over his sister trying to land the coveted spot right on top of my head.<br/>
What *is* it with him? I think he&#39;s practicing for world wrestling<br/>
championships. His father was pretty good supposedly back in college. :-) We<br/>
figure at some point in the distant future we will have our marital bed back<br/>
in the masterbedroom and the kids in their own rooms or on our floor but for<br/>
now I go visit dh in his room. -Arlynn</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2016035397">Arlynn, I really enjoyed your post. I felt like I was right there with you<br/>
and your sleeping family!<br/>
<br/>
One thing you mentioned I wanted to respond to:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Soon enough they will be, like, don&#39;t kiss me<br/>
&gt;&gt;mom, drop me off at the corner so no one sees me get out of the car mom,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I just wanted to say that this is not necessarily true...particularly for<br/>
unschoolers. I have three teenagers now and one almost teenager (17, 15, 13,<br/>
11), and so far they have tolerated my kissing and hugging publicly without<br/>
issue, and have no problem with my presence around them and their friends.<br/>
It&#39;s all about the relationship...I have respected and admired them their<br/>
whole lives, they really like to be with me most of the time. I&#39;m the same<br/>
way with their friends. The stereotypical teenager/parent relationship that<br/>
is portrayed so often...teenager pushes adults away because adults are so<br/>
clueless about teenager...doesn&#39;t really happen in open, respectful, caring<br/>
relationships as far as I can tell.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-104078338">I agree with what Jacki has written below.<br/>
<br/>
I also expected the teens would want to avoid parents, but now I  <br/>
think that&#39;s a school-related thing in part, and a relationship- <br/>
damage thing (school related/culturally expected), and not a  <br/>
&quot;natural&quot; part of teen years.<br/>
<br/>
Hugging and kissing stopped being initiated by me when the boys were  <br/>
at puberty.  Maybe at home I&#39;ll hug someone or rub his head, but I  <br/>
don&#39;t do any more in public than maybe put a hand on his back.   Even  <br/>
if he&#39;s not an anti-mom guy, his friends might all be and it&#39;s not  <br/>
worth the risk of his discomfort.  Sometimes they wanted to initiate  <br/>
more physical contact (Marty still, sometimes) and that&#39;s fine.  If  <br/>
it&#39;s his choice, no problem.<br/>
<br/>
Holly is 14 and will still hold my hand in public sometimes, sit  <br/>
close to me, lean on me in waiting rooms or restaurants, etc.<br/>
<br/>
The boys invite me to the movies sometimes even if their other teen  <br/>
friends are going.  Sometimes I&#39;ve gone, but more often I&#39;ve thanked  <br/>
them and refused, because I think they&#39;ll have more fun if I&#39;m not  <br/>
there.   None of them seems embarrassed to go shopping with me or out  <br/>
to eat.   Even though Marty and Kirby can drive, they still ask me to  <br/>
go with them sometimes.  Marty wanted me to go with him to the  <br/>
orthodontist yesterday.  He checked himself in and made his own next  <br/>
appointment; I just sat in the waiting room and read a magazine, but  <br/>
it made him feel better that I was there.<br/>

envy cross faces when I visit his work place. He works in a very large <br/>
hardware / timber / garden store and always greets me with a hug and a <br/>
kiss, and will walk around the store with his arm around me. He&#39;s always <br/>
been the cuddliest of my babies, but the others all still give me a hug <br/>
or a kiss regardless of who is around and always have done - there has <br/>
never been an embarrassed, withdrawal period in their lives.<br/>

I watched my kids very carefully for signals. There were times when I <br/>
could see they would prefer to initiate hugs themselves, but on the <br/>
other hand they also liked me to sometimes, so they didn&#39;t feel like it <br/>
was them doing the initiating all the time. It&#39;s all pretty subtle. <br/>
After a while I realised I could initiate hugs in front of other <br/>
homeschoolers (not just unschoolers) but elsewhere I left it to them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1090674973">Hi all,<br/>
 <br/>
My 12 year old son, Riley, began to pull away from hugs within the last<br/>
year at the exact same time that he was going through puberty.  He has<br/>
grown 8 inches in one year and has literally changed before my eyes.<br/>
Before this change he liked to hug and be hugged but never as much as my<br/>
two younger children.  My 10 year old son, Casey, loves to cuddle and so<br/>
does my 5 year old daughter, Maggie.  I think that it is partly a<br/>
personality difference with my kids but it is hard to be sure.  Riley is<br/>
my oldest and we were not living an unschooled life for the first 8<br/>
years of his life.  Unfortunately, he was in school and had to live with<br/>
rules.  My two younger children have had the advantage of living a much<br/>
more free life and it really does show at times.    <br/>
 <br/>
However, I have noticed an interesting change in Riley lately.  He has<br/>
his first girlfriend.  He is very affectionate and cuddly with her and<br/>
it seems to have made him a little more open to hugs from me.  <br/>
 <br/>
Also, Riley just experienced his first kiss and he shared that<br/>
information with both my husband and me.  I thought that it was<br/>
absolutely wonderful that he could share something so private and life<br/>
changing with us.  I never told my mom and dad about my first kiss.  He<br/>
also told me jokingly that he only saw half of the movie the other night<br/>
when he went out with some friends to see a movie.  At first I was a<br/>
little confused and then I quickly realized what he was telling me.  He<br/>
and his girlfriend were busy &quot;making out&quot;.  Again, he shared something<br/>
with me that I would have never told my parents and I am sure that most<br/>
kids don&#39;t share with their parents.  I am very grateful that he can be<br/>
so open with us.  <br/>
 <br/>
This open communication helps lessen my worries.  Yes, I have to admit<br/>
that I am a little worried.  Riley&#39;s girlfriend is 14 and is very<br/>
serious about Riley.  I realize that it is not about age, it is more<br/>
about maturity, but every once in a while I become conflicted.  I think<br/>
I am still accepting how much he has changed in the last year.  I am<br/>
also worried about how serious the relationship seems.  I guess I<br/>
expected all of this to happen a little later in life.  Has anyone had<br/>
any similar experiences?  I would really like to hear some of your<br/>
thoughts on this.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks<br/>
Deanne  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-331809903">I haven&#39;t posted before, but have been reading on this group for about 5 months.  I started homeschooling with my daughter at the start of our school year in February.  After a couple of months started moving towards unschooling without knowing yet there was a name.  Found Sandra&#39;s sites and some unschooling books and was emboldened to continue.  <br/>
<br/>
My husband and I come from a very strict upbringing parenting-wise.  So it&#39;s the other half of the unschooling lifestyle that has been very different to anything we know or have seen in others around us.  For the last couple of months we have started to challenge our own ideas with regard to the big 3 - eating, tv, sleeping.  And we have been reading, thinking, talking, changing, watching and waiting.  <br/>
<br/>
I need some advice or perhaps encouragement (but in a helpful informative way, not just pat on the back you&#39;re doing great way).  I am wrecked.  We have 4 children - 1.5 yrs (R), 3.5 yrs (E), 5 yrs (W) and 6.5 yrs (H).  When we decided to stop enforcing bed time at a particular time, things were going well for a while.  Before then, R, E, and W would go to bed at 7 -7.30 and H would stay up til 8.30-9 ish.  R still goes off to bed sleepy at around 7.30-8 (we went into daylight savings too).  W was the only one to say he was tired and could we take him up to bed on some nights (he likes to sleep in his own bed).  H will stay up until the last parent goes to bed because she enjoys that atmosphere I think, and though she wants to stay up later she doesn&#39;t want to be up alone (She doesn&#39;t want to stay up with just W and E, but I&#39;m sure this will change as she gets older).  <br/>
<br/>
But E is this incredible night owl.  One night it was 2.30am before I was able to gently convince her to come lie down in bed with me for a bit when she finally went to sleep.  She probably could have happily stayed awake longer (she wanted to watch another movie) - but I couldn&#39;t. <br/>
<br/>
I understand we have done awful damage that we have to undo now and that we are still deschooling.  And we are still gaining their trust that this process of listening to your own body and recognising when you are tired will continue forever, but in the meantime they are kind of gorging on late nights.  <br/>
<br/>
In the beginning I tried to stay up as late as I could every night so they could experience feeling tired and have experience choosing to go to sleep.  But it doesn&#39;t really seem to be working out that way. H, W, and E are still eager to be up when I want to go to bed somewhere between 10 and 11 - and it just kind of seems that they go to bed when we do rather than finding their own sleepy time. At times gently talking about how tired they look if it&#39;s obvious (tired eyes, yawning, etc) and then the next day maybe if they got cranky trying to piece it together doesn&#39;t make any difference.  And if there is something on in the morning to get to so everyone doesn&#39;t have the time to sleep in until they wake up naturally - it makes getting there on time hard when night owls want to be still sleeping.  And I am up from when the little one R wakes up, usually before everyone else.<br/>
<br/>
I think we have come so far along this road and have changed so much, but some of the benefits seem so far off when I am tired.<br/>
<br/>
Is this all to be expected?  Will this only take a few more weeks before the kids relax into it more?  Are we going about this all wrong?</div>

I think you&#39;ve misunderstood about bedtimes or gotten confused. There&#39;s something in between &quot;making&quot; kids go to bed at a time that&#39;s convenient for you and the whole family pulling your collective hair out because no-one&#39;s getting enough sleep. If the kids will go to bed when you do - even mostly - then make a nice, getting-ready-for-bed routine at least for yourself. Let going to bed be something warm and comfortable rather than something to fight and stress about. There&#39;s nothing whatsoever wrong with having a regular schedule! I work out of the home and have a &quot;bedtime&quot; of my own, and most nights my 9yo comes and snuggles with me for awhile before I fall asleep. Then she either goes to her own bed or gets up and does something else. <br/>
<br/>
Your kids are younger and will need more help if they&#39;re up, but if just one of them is up (other than the 1yo) how much help does that child need? Can you set up snacks and a movie and settle down with the rest? <br/>
