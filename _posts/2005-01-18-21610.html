<div id="ygrps-yiv-1506207145"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;learning is like  walking and school is like spinning. If you&#39;ve been <br/>
 </span></blockquote>spinning for 6 years and  stop and then try to walk you&#39;re going to keep <br/>
spinning. In order to walk  straight you need a period of not spinning. So for now <br/>
declare life as a period  of not spinning.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; <br/>

I love this! I printed this and put  it on our fridge! <br/>
Thanks again! <br/>

 <br/>
That&#39;s not from this list, but from unschooling.com<br/>
which I read right after writing the comment about refrigerator  doors!<br/>
 <br/>
The quote is Joyce Fetteroll, responding to a mother whose son is wary of  <br/>
unschooling and wants to keep being taught, but the mom would like to move  <br/>
toward deschooling him.<br/>
