<div id="ygrps-yiv-761773286">There is a lot of talk about how our brains have certain windows of <br/>
opportunity for learning.<br/>
If you do not get that knowledge in there you missed it.<br/>
Not only that but if you are over 40 forget it!<br/>

<br/>
So not only we, the middle age ones, are happier and smarter but we can learn as <br/>

<br/>
young ones.<br/>
