<div id="ygrps-yiv-1404116480">There&#39;s a blog post, and one quote from it is below.  I&#39;m going to  <br/>
send a monkey-platter note and photo.  My favorite monkey platter  <br/>
plate got broken last summer, and I want to use that picture of it.  I  <br/>
had had it for 20 years.<br/>
<br/>
I thought this might be a project some of you would enjoy, though.   <br/>
Faith Void Taintor is the organizer (it&#39;s her blog, anyway).<br/>

<br/>
&quot;The first work will be a cook book with easy family friendly recipes  <br/>
and short stories from people who have overcome food issues. The book  <br/>
will also include photographs.&quot;<br/>
