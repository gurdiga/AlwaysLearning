<div id="ygrps-yiv-678767146">Not aiming this at anybody but using it as a jumping off spot.  I hear lots<br/>
of people (particularly people who see themselves as &quot;child-centered&quot;) talk<br/>
about having family meetings.....but they don&#39;t sound child centered to me.<br/>
<br/>
The meetings I hear described sound like lots of business meetings I&#39;ve been<br/>
in where it doesn&#39;t matter what the real issues are, you are supposed to<br/>
follow the company line and agree with the boss.<br/>
<br/>
Family meetings seem, at least to me, as a &quot;democratic&quot; way to have kids<br/>
parrot back the &quot;right&quot; answers and then come up with their own punishment.<br/>
(Personally, I would pick drowning in chocolate.)<br/>
<br/>
Would it really be ok in a family meeting if the kids said &quot;You treat me<br/>
like I&#39;m not important and I think you should get sent to your room when you<br/>
do that.&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
I thought when family meeting first were being talked about years ago they<br/>
were supposed to be like a forum, to plan vacations, talk about the upcoming<br/>
week&#39;s schedule, whatever.<br/>
<br/>
But I think they have evolved into a sneaky way to punish and shame kids<br/>
while appearing to be a very hip parent.<br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts on the subject.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I had the same thought.<br/>
<br/>
I think an aspect of the relationship between parent and child that most<br/>
parents aren&#39;t conscious of is the incredible imbalance of power. A<br/>
democratic meeting should mean that all parties have an equal voice. But in<br/>
a family, parents are basically benign dictators. They may choose not to<br/>
weild their authority but there&#39;s no getting around that they can veto<br/>
anything at anytime &quot;just because&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
And to have democratic meetings in a family, parents need to be ultra aware<br/>
of that role. It&#39;s too easy to slip into the role of judge and decision<br/>
maker and &quot;persuader to the right point of view&quot; rather than give that up<br/>
and be one of the &quot;peons&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
(Not that I think as a rule that they should give up veto power. They should<br/>
just be aware of the imbalance of power and guard against slipping into that<br/>
role unconsciously when what is really called for is listening respectfully<br/>
to all points of view, not just the ones we agree with or line up with our<br/>
thinking.)<br/>
<br/>
So when discussing going on a family vacation in a democratic family meeting<br/>
who the suggestions come from shouldn&#39;t matter. Everyone&#39;s ideas should be<br/>
taken equally seriously since to the person their suggestions *are* just as<br/>
serious as anyone else&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Discussing what to do about one person&#39;s actions towards another and what<br/>
punishment, had more the aspects of a trial than a meeting. The child&#39;s<br/>
guilt was already predetermined. The only part that needed settled was to<br/>
have the child publicly admit wrong doing and to choose his punishment.<br/>
