<br/>
My almost 6 year old, Thomas, has discovered, through<br/>
friends, family, various mediums, and asking questions<br/>
of us, there are such things as home video game<br/>
machines and is lusting after one of his own.  He<br/>
looks at ad flyers and selects the games that he wants<br/>

<br/>
We have two quandrys.  One is that we are not certain<br/>
a child this young can handle the responsibility of<br/>
his own system and his own games, when he still leaves<br/>
toys out in the rain and his room looks like a tornado<br/>

into the house and how did that go?  I don&#39;t want to<br/>
have to police his game system because he abuses it,<br/>

<br/>
Secondly, if we do choose to get him a system some<br/>
time in the near future (I mean it breaks my heart to<br/>
watch him &quot;plug&quot; the antennae of his little remote<br/>

car from a pile to insert into the plane as a game<br/>
cartridge, and pretend to play a game &quot;MOMMY!  I got<br/>
Level 48 and 7 points!&quot;) What systems are best?  Which<br/>
ones have the best games, are easy to operate and will<br/>
grow with our boys?<br/>
<br/>
Some help and or advice here would be great, as I have<br/>
zero experience with these systems and the two video<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1049539539">My oldest discovered video games at 7.5, my youngest was 4.5 and went right<br/>
along with her.<br/>
<br/>
We gave them our old black and white Gameboys, and then they &quot;graduated&quot;<br/>
rapidly to our old original Nintendo NES. My sister gave us her Nintendo 64<br/>
over the summer when she upgraded. For Christmas we&#39;re getting them Gameboy<br/>
Advanced systems (they&#39;re handheld, so we&#39;ll get one for each).<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re both better about putting up games than they were even a few months<br/>
ago, but we have our systems in the living room, which gets picked up by my<br/>
husband or I every night. The cartridges are relatively sturdy -- they won&#39;t<br/>
be destroyed by being accidentally kicked under a table, etc.<br/>

<br/>
YOU own it and take care of it.  I think that&#39;s a better solution.  treat it <br/>
like a television, and treat the games like you treat the family&#39;s DVDs and <br/>
videos.  Keep them in the living room or wherever the TV is, get a good box <br/>
or case for the games, BUY PLAYERS GUIDES!!!!  maybe put plastic covers on <br/>
them, and YOU take care of them!<br/>
<br/>
Since they&#39;re young, I would go with Nintendo.  I&#39;d get a Nintendo 64 for <br/>
them (Holly concurs) which you can probably buy used and also you can get <br/>
LOTS of used games which will be good for kids.<br/>
<br/>
The controllers are $30 each new and plan on having to replace one or two.  <br/>
<br/>
When you first buy it, get two controllers so they can do two-player games.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Holly says there aren&#39;t that many little kids games for the Nintendo Game <br/>
Cube (their current system).  AND WORSE:  the game cube games need a memory <br/>
card--not so easy to operate for a six year old and EASY to lose.<br/>
<br/>
Nintendo 64!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1720584972">Nanci,<br/>
<br/>
Our boys started with Gameboys, then they got nintendo 64 and now they<br/>
play Gamecube.  I was reluctant at first but we&#39;ve had some surprising<br/>
outcomes.  One, the two cooperate much more on things.  They want to do<br/>
better on the games and this means they must share information.  Our 8<br/>
year old is a much better reader than the 6 year old.  The older boy<br/>
reads the strategy guide to the younger one.  THey also learned a lot<br/>
about map reading from these guides as they take the player through each<br/>
room in the game and provide an overall map of the level.  These guides<br/>
have been a godsend for reading in our house.  Reading is a big goal of<br/>
ours and anything that supports that is ok by me....well almost<br/>
everything.<br/>
<br/>
WHile I hate the addictive quality, I am pleased with my younger sons<br/>
increased interest and hard work to read and sound out words.  It is<br/>
also a great motivator for work and chores.  When they obsess too much<br/>
on the game, we take it away for a few days.  We also allow them to earn<br/>
more time by doing extra projects.  They start with half our each and<br/>
earn more time with more work.  If they get to where they are yelling<br/>
and fighting over it, they get about 2 minutes to find a solution or the<br/>
whole thing goes off.  It is amazing how fast problems can be solved<br/>
when &quot;beloved&quot; is headed for the closet.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also nice to have something to keep them occupied when I&#39;m not<br/>
feeling well.  I know where they are and what they are doing.<br/>

Many families find  more lasting joy by not causing it to become &quot;the <br/>

<br/>
Our very peaceful method has been that generally whoever has the computer, or <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1918007722">well said sandra.  Also, our playstation use goes in spurts.  Weeks and <br/>
weeks can go by with no usage and then Lexie will play it almost <br/>
constantly for hours and hours, days and days.  It&#39;s really good for her <br/>
fine motor skills, and she has fun so...<br/>
<br/>
We do need another computer though, she has discovered the internet.  So <br/>
now there are three users and one computer.  Not a good number.  I need <br/>
to get a job.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1337674459">Hi Nanci,<br/>
<br/>
Our son started at 4yrs old with Playstation with that lovable Spyro the<br/>
Dragon game. ( I love that game) the other Spyro game are very good as well.<br/>
oh, and Crash Team Racing (multi-player) is great too.<br/>
He is 8 now & we have Playstation 2 for Ace Combat 04 (another awesome<br/>
game - we spent months on that, went to the Air Force Museum a few times,<br/>
read books on planes, watched Discovery Wings Channel everyday, sometimes<br/>
all day and *I swear it was all my sons doing* he found planes (any planes)<br/>
so interesting). and of course the Star Wars games.<br/>
We also have the X- Box (has a built in memory chip) for HALO (multi-player)<br/>
(ultimate awesome, kill the alien baddies, game) & Morrowind (first game I<br/>
played that lets you decide how you want the story line to go) LOVE IT!<br/>
(kinda, sorta, like EQ, a bit Nanci, kinda) ooh, OBI WAN is good too. We<br/>
weren&#39;t crazy about Spiderman though - jeez the Training took forever. Ooh,<br/>
Arctic Thunder is good too. (and multi-player)<br/>
<br/>
The first Playstation console games can be played on Playstation 2. We<br/>
rented a lot of games & bought the ones we really like. You can also rent<br/>
the different systems (that is what we did for the X-box, didn&#39;t like the<br/>
Game Cube)<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t put a time limit on how long he can play.   just our way ;)<br/>
<br/>
Catherine made the point that when she isn&#39;t feeling well, she knows where<br/>
her children are and what they are doing. (I hear you on that, it helped a<br/>
lot when I had the flu)<br/>
And Joylyn said that &quot;weeks & weeks can go by with no usage&quot; that has<br/>
happened here too.<br/>
<br/>
Just rent first.<br/>
<br/>
hope this helped a bit Nanci<br/>
<br/>
See you on EQ!<br/>

Christmas that year. I had it engraved with &quot;Homer&quot; just like Homer did when<br/>
he gave Marge a bowling ball. I really was giving it to Jocelyn (and me), I<br/>

strategy he uses? <br/>
There are hundreds of sites out there that discuss the pros and cons of the<br/>
various systems. If it were me, Like Sandra said, I would go with a Nintendo<br/>
64. There are lots of games written for it that appeal to kids your son&#39;s<br/>
age. Buying it and the games used is far less expensive than the current<br/>
models and they are in plentiful supply. So for the same money as a new<br/>
system and one game - you can get a very good system and many, many games<br/>
and I would bet that the older kids in your support group have games,<br/>
experience, and advice to share with you and your son on that gamming<br/>
platform.<br/>

both Jocelyn and me so interested in it. She just got the Gamecube version<br/>
as a birthday gift from her boys.<br/>
<br/>
I agree that you should read Sandra&#39;s page if you haven&#39;t yet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-448974405">Nanci,<br/>
I agree with Sandra that it would be best if you start with the plan you<br/>
will be the responsible party to keep track of games and put them away<br/>
etc.   Your kids will get there but it&#39;s hard at first to remember and<br/>
you&#39;ll save yourself a lot of frustration if you don&#39;t expect more from<br/>
them than they&#39;re ready for.  <br/>
<br/>
My son got his Playstation just before he turned seven.   He was very<br/>
responsible but that&#39;s his nature.  He started with games like Spyro and<br/>
Croc and really in the beginning played for long hours, learning every<br/>
tiny detail and mastering the controller.   It was an amazing thing to<br/>
watch.    And like all things children find their own balance once the<br/>
need to figure out everything has been fulfilled.  My son&#39;s Playstation<br/>
use is like anything else.   When there&#39;s a new game he plays until he&#39;s<br/>
got an active picture of it in his mind and until he&#39;s had some success. <br/>
  It&#39;s the same way I read or do a puzzle,  working at it for hours one<br/>
or two days and then in bits or pieces others.     <br/>
<br/>
Please, please, resist the idea to freak out when the game is new and<br/>
they want to play a lot.&lt;g&gt;  I don&#39;t agree with the other poster that<br/>
this is addictive or that a deep interest is obsessive.    I think a deep<br/>
interest is the sign of an intelligent child, who will find a way to<br/>
accomplish the goals of the game.  I think this is really healthy and<br/>
necessary and I hope you can think about their experiences with a game<br/>
system the way you would an artists need to paint or a poets need to<br/>
write.   It&#39;s a real need and it&#39;s normal, and there will be times of<br/>
higher interest and times of less interest. <br/>
<br/>
During times of high interest, like the first month or two, you might<br/>
have to take food to your kids.  &lt;g&gt;   Really, the games are so fun that<br/>
it&#39;s hard to leave them at first to go do less important things, like<br/>
eat.  This is another point where parents go nuts and decide their kids<br/>
are addicted, because they don&#39;t want to come to the dinner table. <br/>
Remain calm!&lt;g&gt;   Take them food,   keep them happy.  This too shall<br/>
pass. <br/>
<br/>
Dylan would get wildly frustrated at some of his games when he couldn&#39;t<br/>
achieve some goal.  It is my experience that it&#39;s best to sympathize at<br/>
such times and let them work through it in their own way.  We listened to<br/>
a lot of growling and some stomping but I think it&#39;s really important for<br/>
them to be able to progress in a natural way.    This is the other place<br/>
where some parents go berserk and take the game away,&lt;g&gt; and I would<br/>
really, really NOT do that.    Think how you would respond if they were<br/>
frustrated with trying to read a book.   You wouldn&#39;t demand they leave<br/>
it alone, or take it away, you&#39;d offer sympathy and  you&#39;d  let them work<br/>
it out.    It&#39;s just a little noisier with a game system.&lt;g&gt;  As time<br/>
goes on it gets easier for them to stay calm because they have a lot of<br/>
experience that tells them they&#39;ll get it eventually. <br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t live without some kind of game system or other, they are that<br/>
wonderful.  Dylan has learned so much and gotten so much pleasure out of<br/>
it.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1985800242">***When they obsess too much<br/>
on the game, we take it away for a few days.  We also allow them to earn<br/>
more time by doing extra projects.  They start with half our each and<br/>
earn more time with more work.  If they get to where they are yelling<br/>
and fighting over it, they get about 2 minutes to find a solution or the<br/>
whole thing goes off.  It is amazing how fast problems can be solved<br/>
when &quot;beloved&quot; is headed for the closet.***<br/>
<br/>
I look at these game systems the way I view my own hobbies and interests<br/>
and those of my husband. <br/>
Some times, when he is working on a project in his little shop he can<br/>
stay at it for hours, stay out there most of the night, until he&#39;s come<br/>
to a natural stopping point.   When he&#39;s fly fishing, there can be no<br/>
time limit, it&#39;s a thing that needs exactly the amount of time and<br/>
attention as he will give it.  <br/>
<br/>
When I am painting or writing poetry I can go for hours and hours, not<br/>
eating, just doing, until the session comes to a natural end.   <br/>
<br/>
I would no more take away my husbands shop or fly rod than he would take<br/>
away my paints or paper.<br/>
That seems like a totally unhealthy and inappropriate response to a<br/>
natural human need. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t make my husband earn his time fly fishing and I don&#39;t take his<br/>
time away if he&#39;s grumpy. <br/>
<br/>
I want to point out what is obvious to unschoolers, that kids learn at<br/>
their own pace and in their own time.  They learn to talk this way and<br/>
walk and read and count money.    I think we need to remember that kids<br/>
will learn about their own schedules and limits and game system abilities<br/>
the same way.  It doesn&#39;t come all at once or because we say so,  it<br/>
comes by them being able to do it until they understand.  Understanding<br/>
doesn&#39;t come in half hour increments on our schedule,  it has to be on<br/>
theirs, in whatever amount of time they need.   <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine any parent who would forbid a toddler to walk if the<br/>
toddler became frustrated.  I can&#39;t imaging any parent who would give a<br/>
toddler only a half hour a day to try to learn to walk.   <br/>
Apply this to anything else, learning to talk, learning to get dressed or<br/>
ride a bike or catch a ball...   It can&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t be controlled by<br/>
anyone but the learner. <br/>

&gt; Our very peaceful method has been that generally whoever has the<br/>

&gt; a game, can play until he&#39;s finished.  Sometimes that is five minutes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sometimes it is three hours.  But the next person plays when that<br/>
&gt; person is<br/>
&gt; finished.  And the person plays as long as he wants to.<br/>

&gt; lifting a book out of a person&#39;s hands as they were in mid sentence.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My 13 y.o. son&#39;s a lot like yours, only with Ultima Online.  I used to sit <br/>
and listen when someone would &#39;rip him off&#39; or not hold up their end of a <br/>
bargain made on this supposed-to-be-for-adults online game <br/>
website.  Crying, frustrated screaming, slamming doors, hitting things <br/>
(inanimate things), etc.  Real tantrum behavior.  He continued to get more <br/>
and more upset as this happened over and over again.  I started talking <br/>
with the spouse about how maybe the boy wasn&#39;t ready for UO and maybe we <br/>
should stop &#39;letting&#39; him play.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, one day when I was really busy, with just half an ear, I listened <br/>
to him, said, &#39;wow, that gotta be really frustrating&#39;, and &#39;what are you <br/>
going to do about it?&#39;   He stomped off, took a several week break (not <br/>
mandated by us) and is now back in the game.  Best of all, he&#39;s moderating <br/>
his own behavior when he gets frustrated and we don&#39;t have the <br/>
screamy-mimis any more.<br/>
<br/>
Life rocks.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that, in our case, my intervention was allowing his behavior <br/>
to continue.  I supported it in some strange way... or maybe he&#39;d just <br/>
coincidentally reached the point where he was ready to deal with his <br/>
frustration in a more mature manner.<br/>

coincidentally reached the point where he was ready to deal with his <br/>
frustration in a more mature manner.<br/>
As always, your mileage may vary, &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Very true about mileage may vary.<br/>
<br/>
In light of the recent dust-up, though I&#39;d like to suggest that anyone whose <br/>
VW is getting only two miles to the gallon has a problem, and anyone whose VW <br/>
goes 80 miles to the gallon might be exaggerating!!  There is a range...<br/>
<br/>
It does seem like sometimes they just want someone to say something kinda <br/>
comforting or accepting.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby used to rant some.  I&#39;d try distraction, like &quot;Do you want to take a <br/>
break and play with the dog?&quot;  Sometimes just remembering we HAD a dog was <br/>
enough of a reality check for him to take a breath.  And &quot;No, I want to keep <br/>
working on this game&quot; was an acceptable answer.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I&#39;m also wondering if maybe her &#39;being right is important to you&#39; and <br/>
&#39;bashing&#39; belief is transferral or projected or something. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I thought &quot;projection&quot; when I summarized the situation in my mind earlier <br/>
today.</div>

&gt; to him, said, &#39;wow, that gotta be really frustrating&#39;, and &#39;what are you <br/>
&gt; going to do about it?&#39;   He stomped off, took a several week break (not <br/>
&gt; mandated by us) and is now back in the game.  Best of all, he&#39;s moderating <br/>
&gt; his own behavior when he gets frustrated and we don&#39;t have the <br/>

&gt; Life rocks.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That is wonderful! BTW I thought your &quot;screamy-mimis&quot; was funny. We have the <br/>
screaming-mimis here and we also have the herky-jerky dance. Usually it is me <br/>
with the screaming-mimis &lt;g&gt; but when the kids do it they sometimes combine <br/>
it with the herky-jerky dance. Its really funny to see, much to the utmost <br/>
frustration of said dancer. &lt;beg&gt; <br/>
