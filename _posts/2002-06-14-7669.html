<div id="ygrps-yiv-1579798613">One time when my oldest was about 8 or 9 and we were at a 4-H meeting, I sent <br/>
her to make a phone call.  She came back a few minutes later saying she <br/>
didn&#39;t know how to use the phone.  I was a little po&#39;d and marched over to do <br/>
it myself..I found it to be a rotary!!  She&#39;d never seen one before :)<br/>
<br/>
Also about the same time she came running home from a neighbors announcing <br/>
they had &quot;those BIG CD&#39;s&quot;  She&#39;d obviously never seen a record either:)<br/>
