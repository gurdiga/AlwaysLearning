<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am wondering if mindfulness and unschooling are compatible<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Probably everything I know about mindfulness (the Buddhist practice)  <br/>
comes from others who have found pieces that work with their  <br/>
unschooling and bring those ideas to unschooling discussions.<br/>
<br/>
The problem with combining any two philosophies is that individual  <br/>
practices and principles from each might work well together, the  <br/>
goals aren&#39;t necessarily compatible. So when facing some problem one  <br/>
philosophy will pull one way and the other will pull another. Both  <br/>
answers will have a rightness to them and it won&#39;t be clear why the  <br/>
confusion.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the problem parents who practice conventional parenting face.  <br/>
Conventional parenting is sort of a &quot;do what&#39;s best for the kids&quot;  <br/>
philosophy. But &quot;best&quot; isn&#39;t clearly defined and parents end up  <br/>
pulling bits and pieces from lots of different philosophies with  <br/>
incompatible goals.<br/>
<br/>
As another example, it recently struck me that some people who&#39;ve  <br/>
adopted natural living as their philosophy will also adopt natural  <br/>
learning. They&#39;ll sometimes call what they&#39;re doing unschooling  <br/>
because natural learning and unschooling seem like the same thing.  <br/>
And they label their life philosophy unschooling probably because  <br/>
natural learning is the piece of their lives that sets them the  <br/>
furthest from mainstream so it seems like the central part.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that the natural living and unschooling philosophies  <br/>
aren&#39;t the same. The philosophy of natural living narrows the world  <br/>
to what they parent believes is the best part. If a child&#39;s interests  <br/>
-- like snack foods or Spongebob cartoons or cheap plastic toys --  <br/>
lay beyond mom&#39;s definition of &quot;best&quot; and &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;wholesome&quot;  <br/>
she needs to compromise unschooling to make natural living work.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s probably easier and clearer to focus on one philosophy and add  <br/>
practices and ideas from other philosophies that help it work even  <br/>
better.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>They may share some principles and have some features in common but I  <br/>
think it muddies understanding to lump them together because of that.  <br/>
Mindfulness, NVC and attachment parenting are all intended for  <br/>
different purposes.<br/>
<br/>
Mindfulness is a personal practice to reach Buddhist enlightenment.  <br/>
NVC is intended, as someone recently pointed out, was to reach a  <br/>
feeling of fairness between two groups who aren&#39;t necessarily working  <br/>
towards a better relationship. Attachment parenting was originally a  <br/>
way to enhance the mother child bond by the mother becoming sensitive  <br/>
to the child&#39;s needs, but has become, as Sandra has pointed out, more  <br/>
of a way for mothers to provide only what&#39;s &quot;good&quot; for their babies.  <br/>
(The new leaning tends to fall apart when kids show signs their ideas  <br/>
of what&#39;s &quot;good&quot; don&#39;t match mom&#39;s!)<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about helping kids explore what interests them so  <br/>
their learning is joyful.<br/>
<br/>
All those have totally different goals.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am asking because I know mindfulness benefits brain development  <br/>
&gt; and emotional intelligence.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Brain development and emotional intelligence will be side effects of  <br/>
being attentive to children&#39;s needs and helping them explore what  <br/>
interests them. Parents can pull bits and pieces from other  <br/>
philosophies that can make it easier for kids to explore joyfully.  <br/>
(For instance, if a practice from mindfulness helped a mother accept  <br/>
a child&#39;s feelings as a natural reaction rather than trying to change  <br/>
him, that would help unschooling.)<br/>
<br/>
If a mom&#39;s focus shifts to a concrete goal like brain development or  <br/>
emotional intelligence, that can interfere with unschooling when a  <br/>
child&#39;s needs seem to turn away from those. The goals of &quot;freedom to  <br/>
explore&quot; and &quot;right pathway&quot; won&#39;t mesh at all.<br/>

<br/>
Within Buddhism, as translated into English, that&#39;s true.  They used  <br/>
the very old English word &quot;mindfulness&quot; to serve as this or that other  <br/>
words originally in Chinese, or Japanese, or Vietnamese, or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
In English, and as I&#39;ve used it in unschooling discussions, it means  <br/>
to pay attention to; to pay mind to; to have it in one&#39;s mind.  to be  <br/>
mindful.<br/>
<br/>
Mindful of what?  Not of Buddhism or enlightenment.<br/>
<br/>
Mindful of one&#39;s beliefs and goals.  Mindful of one&#39;s child,  <br/>
directly.  Attentive.  Thoughtful.  Aware.<br/>

What does that mean, &quot;fall into mindfulness&quot;?  Into a category of  <br/>
things that are mindful as opposed to things that aren&#39;t?<br/>

Mindfulness happens inside an individual&#39;s mind.  That&#39;s the only  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I was speaking plain, normal English.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually fairly recent English. What Sandra means is mindful has an  <br/>
older, common meaning: to be alert, to be attentive to. That&#39;s a  <br/>
concept that&#39;s useful for unschooling so it&#39;s a good word to keep  <br/>
here for it&#39;s usual sense.<br/>
<br/>
Mindfulness was appropriated for the Buddhist concept . &quot;Mindful&quot; is  <br/>
more of a label on a whole package of ideas. Unless someone&#39;s  <br/>
somewhat familiar with what&#39;s in the package, using the label doesn&#39;t  <br/>
convey much. The NVC label is the same.<br/>
<br/>
The less jargon that&#39;s used, the clearer the communication. If the  <br/>
box of Buddhist mindfulness is opened up rather than using the label,  <br/>
examining the contents pretty much answers the question. A mom  <br/>
striving for Buddhist enlightenment doesn&#39;t help kids learn. Nor does  <br/>
a mom doing yoga. Nor a mom meditating. Some of the practices adopted  <br/>
for stress relief in the west could help the mom destress. But a mom  <br/>
trying to practice yoga with toddlers will probably add to her  <br/>
stress!  So it&#39;s more useful to talk specifically about ways to  <br/>
destress that don&#39;t interfere with unschooling rather than to haul  <br/>
out the whole Buddhist mindfulness box that has breathing intended to  <br/>
help someone toward enlightenment in it ;-)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; For children under 5 years of age, NVC would look like attachment  <br/>

&gt; I&#39;m not sure what you mean &quot;to help identify their feelings.&quot; For  <br/>
&gt; the parents to identify their children&#39;s feelings? For children to  <br/>
&gt; identify their own feelings?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It doesn&#39;t take NVC to help kids figure out what their feelings are.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; (NVC does fall into mindfulness. It works clinically for adults to  <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Do you mean NVC works clinically for adults? Or mindfulness works  <br/>
&gt; clinically for adults? Or that NVC &quot;does fall into mindfulness&quot;?   <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m having a hard time understanding what you mean.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Mindfulness&quot; is generally considered to be a translation of  <br/>
&gt; Buddhist practice (in different languages: Pali &quot;sati,&quot; Tibetan  <br/>
&gt; &quot;trenpa, Chinese &quot;nian&quot;). However, the term been around a long time  <br/>
&gt; in the West. From Wikipedia, with footnotes: **The English term  <br/>
&gt; mindfulness has been in use for centuries, long predating its use in  <br/>
&gt; the Buddhist context. The OED defines it as &quot;The state or quality of  <br/>
&gt; being mindful; attention; regard&quot;, with obsolete meanings of  <br/>
&gt; &quot;memory&quot; and &quot;intention, purpose&quot;. This word was first recorded as  <br/>
&gt; myndfulness in 1530 (Palsgrave translates French pensee) , as  <br/>
&gt; mindfulnesse in 1561, and mindfulness in 1817.**<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Mindfulness also includes mediation and yoga.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Mindfulness can be cultivated through meditation and yoga,  <br/>
&gt; certainly, but the practice of mindfulness itself does not &quot;include&quot;  <br/>
&gt; meditation and yoga.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I am asking because I know mindfulness benefits brain development  <br/>
&gt;&gt; and emotional intelligence.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m a bit confused about what you are asking or trying to get at.   <br/>
&gt; It seems (and I could be wrong!) that you want to say that NVC  <br/>
&gt; (being an apparent practice of mindfulness) is superior to  <br/>
&gt; unschooling, which, to you, is incompatible with mindfulness.<br/>

The main thing that makes radical unschooling work is to really key into our children so that we can support and facilitate their learning and growth in their whole lives--including emotional.  <br/>
<br/>
NVC can support that for some people--helping to give them more insight into their own emotional states so that they are more able to empathize with their children.  But it&#39;s not necessary for everyone--some parents don&#39;t need those skills, and it can end up being another layer that gets in the way rather than helping.  Trying to impose someone else&#39;s (in this case, Marshall Rosenberg&#39;s) system can overlay their own and inhibit the natural connection they already have with their kids.  Some people may get a lot out of it, and it can help improve their relationships, but others are awkwardly trying to use a script in a way that feels like ill-fitting clothes.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been mulling over this since I first read it.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if &quot;natural living&quot; could be considered a value rather than a life philosophy? And I wonder if sometimes our values bump up against our unschooling philosophy and we just need to sort that out.<br/>
<br/>
In our house, we value reducing our ecological &quot;foot print&quot; and talk about ways to do that (my kid loves to watch The Story of Stuff). We also value purchasing toys, etc. that are most likely not to contain lead or other yucky things (although there are no guarantees). And we are long-time vegetarians (although my son is welcome to eat meat if/when he decides to) and choose organic as often as possible. Some of our values (and life choices) might make us look like &quot;natural living&quot; folks but I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s an all encompassing life philosophy for our family.<br/>
<br/>
We are, however, embracing a deeper unschooling philosophy in our family - one that extends to our whole life together. We strongly desire to support our child&#39;s interests and make them a priority. When an aspect of an interest bumps up against a value, we are finding ways to work through this. It&#39;s challenging to examine our dearly-held values in light of this whole life unschooling philosophy, but it&#39;s worth it. It seems to be part of my internal &quot;stretching&quot;  right now - and part of &quot;saying yes&quot; more often - and working things out, together, as a family when that yes just isn&#39;t forthcoming.<br/>
<br/>
But does that mean that we shouldn&#39;t consider what we are moving into as whole life (radical) unschooling based on our prior values? Especially if we are &quot;mindful of&quot; (as in &quot;attentive to&quot;) potential conflicts?<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a sincere question and one I&#39;ve been wondering about. It might be that we will eventually say we are &quot;natural learners&quot; and leave it at that - or use the term &quot;unschooling&quot; to only talk about how we approach learning.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Generally speaking I&#39;d say a philosophy is an ideal with a set of  <br/>
values that support it. It&#39;s what someone turns to to help them  <br/>
decide if an idea is right or wrong for them. It can apply to a part  <br/>
of life, like a child&#39;s learning, or all of life. Generally I&#39;d say a  <br/>
philosophy is something you&#39;re willing to make your life more  <br/>
difficult for in order to stick with it. How difficult someone is  <br/>
willing to make their life depends. Some people are willing to die  <br/>
for their philosophy. Or sacrifice their only son ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Of the specific people I&#39;m thinking of, natural living was definitely  <br/>
a philosophy, if not a life philosophy. It formed the foundation of  <br/>
their life choices. Organic food. Organic gardening. Composting. No  <br/>
plastic. No commercial TV. I didn&#39;t get the feeling they&#39;d die for it  <br/>
though ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Everyone also has a collection of values that shift in priority  <br/>
depending on the situation that don&#39;t necessarily form a cohesive  <br/>
whole. (And some *only* have a shifting collection.) It might be  <br/>
labeled a personal philosophy though in my mind a personal philosophy  <br/>
means someone has given the collection some thought. It&#39;s not just a  <br/>
mish mosh with choices based on current mood ;-)<br/>
<br/>
For instance I value being conservative with money, being green,  <br/>
buying food with fewer chemicals. Which of those takes precedence  <br/>
depends on the situation. May depend on whim. May depend on some  <br/>
other value being more important (like saving time, for instance.)<br/>
<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, that&#39;s what happens with a philosophy. :-) It can help people  <br/>
see a bigger picture, feel like they have a goal.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But does that mean that we shouldn&#39;t consider what we are moving  <br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not entirely sure of what you&#39;re asking. But my guess would be it  <br/>
depends where your priorities end up being. For instance if parents  <br/>
value organic food and children exploring their interests, when those  <br/>
two conflict, if the parents are mostly choosing one over the other  <br/>
it&#39;s a good indication of which is most important, which is their  <br/>
overriding philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not totally cut and dried. Just because I wouldn&#39;t have  <br/>
sacrificed my life to allow Kathryn to unschool, doesn&#39;t mean I  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t think of myself as a radical unschooler ;-) What&#39;s  <br/>
important is that someone is making thoughtful choices.<br/>
<br/>
But what&#39;s important *here* on this list, is helping people with the  <br/>
parts of their life they&#39;re deliberately trying to make more  <br/>
difficult by choosing to unschool. If someone decides their children  <br/>
need to be vegetarian rather than explore their own interests in  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1711123567">-=-I wonder if &quot;natural living&quot; could be considered a value rather  <br/>
than a life philosophy? And I wonder if sometimes our values bump up  <br/>
against our unschooling philosophy and we just need to sort that out.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think defining things as values or philosophies is more a part of  <br/>
identifying with other people than of making decisions in one&#39;s own  <br/>
life.<br/>
<br/>
Because the phrase &quot;natural living&quot; is too vague to cover anyone&#39;s  <br/>
entire life experience and needs, it&#39;s better as a magazine title or a  <br/>
conference title than as a philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
As a priority or a principle, it can be added on to anything.  Making  <br/>
the more natural choice can&#39;t always be practical, but having it on  <br/>
the checklist as something to aim toward can be.<br/>
<br/>
Holly and I had a discussion a week or two ago about adults going  <br/>
barefooted, in the late 1960&#39;s, early &#39;70&#39;s.  Why?  Because it was  <br/>
different and because it was natural.  Then we were watching Roots,  <br/>
lately (first four episodes, and then Holly&#39;s out-of-town trip came)  <br/>
and we talked about &quot;afros&quot; and natural long hair.  Choosing things on  <br/>
the basis of their being more &quot;natural&quot; (or &quot;organic&quot;) was an  <br/>
important part of the counter-culture &#39;60&#39;s/hippie/health food larger  <br/>
changes in 1969, give or take.<br/>
<br/>
Being barefooted turned into the &quot;Earth Shoe&quot; company, which involved  <br/>
the heel being lower than the ball of the foot.  Those shoes weren&#39;t  <br/>
&quot;natural,&quot; but they were more natural than some other shoes.<br/>
<br/>
Each person decides on shoes, food, clothes, housing (if they&#39;re  <br/>
lucky), transportation, etc.  Each parent has responsibilities to take  <br/>
care of children, and choosing &quot;natural&quot; over children&#39;s needs and  <br/>
desires could be a problem.<br/>
<br/>
Flexibility and being analytical in each moment is better than  <br/>
deciding which &quot;belief system&quot; to follow, in my experience.<br/>

<br/>
In our house, we value reducing our ecological &quot;foot print&quot; and talk about ways to do that (my kid loves to watch The Story of Stuff). ***<br/>
<br/>
This came up in a radical unschooling panel discussion at a local homeschooling conference.  This comes up periodically on unschooling lists as well.<br/>
<br/>
What it always comes down to is whether or not mom or dad&#39;s philosophy will override a child&#39;s.  If a child really wants a juice box and a parent won&#39;t buy one because it creates waste to be disposed of, then mom&#39;s philosophy overrides a child&#39;s desire for a juice box.<br/>
<br/>
When I remind myself of the HUGE amount of waste that happens in public schools, little throw away juice boxes seem like a small insignificant drop in the bucket.  By unschooling, we ARE being mindful of waste.  We don&#39;t litter school hallways, we don&#39;t use up vast amounts of paper for meaningless projects, we don&#39;t get sent paper work ad infinitum from the school and the teachers, we don&#39;t buy notebooks that get used and then disposed of, nor do we kill millions of frogs for dissection.  <br/>
<br/>
The one thing I know without a doubt to be true... If a parent is a big fat jerk and they treat recyclables better than they do their own children, their children are very unlikely to value recycling!<br/>

Keith is in a singing group.  They don&#39;t meet at our house, but he&#39;s  <br/>
the one who finds their music.<br/>
<br/>
He had written up the words to a song, and made eight copies at work.   <br/>
They decided to change the words.  I offered to reformat that file and  <br/>
print them here off my printer at home, but he said a couple of the  <br/>
group members were adamant that it would be a waste of paper not to  <br/>
make the changes by hand on each sheet.<br/>
<br/>
I know all those singers.  They&#39;re in their 40&#39;s and 50&#39;s, mostly;  <br/>
childless; uptight.<br/>
<br/>
I sent some other music with Keith that night, that we still have in a  <br/>
file drawer from the late 1970&#39;s, before the days of freely-available  <br/>
photocopying on plain paper.  The music had been handwritten by me on  <br/>
mimeograph masters and run off on inexpensive paper, and we still have  <br/>
lots of that.  So I sent that, told Keith to tell them I said that we  <br/>
are NOT wasteful of paper, and it was better to learn from decent  <br/>
copies.  They laughed and agreed.<br/>
<br/>
The arguments and defenses and negativities and assurances did more  <br/>
damage to psyches and planet than a ream of paper just thrown in the  <br/>
trash would have done.  TOO much energy, over eight sheets of paper.<br/>

No, without having to add all kinds of other &quot;isms&quot; or &quot;nessess&quot; to the equation.<br/>
<br/>
I realize my last post wasn&#39;t very generous, and I apologize.  I just had a long harrowing conversation with a friend who wants to practice all kinds of lovely philosophies but can&#39;t, for even the shortest amount of time, look at her children and give them what they ask for--which is her attention!  <br/>

The Kabbot-Zinns have a lot of good to say.  And I can see how their message can go along with unschooling. But for me, there is nothing more simple (not always easy) than just paying attention to my daughter.<br/>

My original post had more to do with offering mindfulness (Buddhism) to children. In Los Angeles, specifically, Santa Monica where I live, they offer mindfulness classes to children starting at age 4. Currently, I am &quot;studying&quot; mindfulness&#39;s effect on adult brains. I am finding all the information I am finding regarding neuroplasticity fascinating and I can&#39;t help but wonder - would it be helpful if I introduce certain aspects of mindfulness to my daughter? Currently, we do yoga for kids at home. She loves pretending to be a frog and doing assisted handstands. That came about organically because we were walking by the yoga class and she wanted to go in. Maybe it all can be that way - we walk by something and we try it and then we find ways to do it at home and I just let that be instead of thinking about ways to enhance her brain/her potential - something that does not fit into unschooling. That is what I am finding difficult...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Part of why you&#39;re finding this difficult is that your daughter is only four!  I remember having my oldest be four and thinking that I needed to expose him to everything now, now, now!  My friend and I were just laughing about all the science experiments and things we did so that they would have all those things &quot;under their belts&quot;--and now they don&#39;t even remember them.  We are doing science experiments now and what they are getting out of them is so very different I can&#39;t even tell you--now our boys are 14 and 15.<br/>
<br/>
Which is not at all to say not to do science experiments--but just do them for the fun and enjoyment.  That&#39;s what I&#39;d go back and do, in this respect, if I had my boy four again.  Although childhood is fleeting in one sense, there is also plenty of time for all of this stuff, and for our kids to come to stuff as they are ready.  There will be so many thousands of conversations with your daughter by the time she is 14 in which you will discuss all sorts of things, including mindfulness when it actually has meaning for her as a practice.  Before then, she&#39;ll be watching you--how you react, how you process your emotions, and I&#39;ll be that will have a much bigger internal impact on her than a class that is appealing to an intellect that isn&#39;t yet ready to incorporate these abstract thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
Until kids are a certain age, we really aren&#39;t self-concious in a way necessary for mindfulness to have meaning.  We just are.  Our kids ARE having a direct experience with being present and in the moment.  I think trying to impose a structure before there&#39;s substance to support it is, in essence, a waste of time and money.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-...thinking about ways to enhance her brain/her potential-=-<br/>
<br/>
The way to enhance her brain potential IS to have fun, talk, laugh, play, be silly, explore share, etc.  That IS it--nothing more--but that&#39;s A LOT.  If a class helps do those things, and is MOSTLY about those things, then that could be a cool class.  If not, then don&#39;t do it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I read a lot of stuff - Kabbot-Zinn, NVC, and on and on. I read them <br/>
once and let the ideas flow around in my head and some influence me and <br/>
some don&#39;t. I don&#39;t adopt any of them as a way of life - I make up my <br/>
OWN way of life based on my own family. Some people, like Sandra, have <br/>
had a HUGE influence on how I think and behave, others have had none. <br/>
Some of these books I&#39;ve read and philosophies I&#39;ve taken a look at <br/>
might have added some idea to my overall way of thinking that I&#39;m not <br/>
even aware of. The level of commitment some people seem to have to some <br/>
of these systems, or philosophies, or beliefs, or whatever you want to <br/>
call them, seems like the worst kind of religious belief, to me. They <br/>
think their chosen &quot;system&quot; has all the answers - everybody else&#39;s <br/>
system is lacking, and if only everybody would adopt their system there <br/>
would be heaven on earth.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I agree that really looking and observing and considering our <br/>
own children is the most enlightening thing we can do. I look back and <br/>
think that what I did was dip into some philosophy or another and then <br/>
give it a reality check by thinking about it in relation to my own <br/>
family. I&#39;d imagine how it would go over, what difference it would make, <br/>
and so on. And, sometimes, some part of it made sense and I very <br/>
naturally integrated it into our family life.<br/>

<br/>
The huge difference between adults and kids is the adults feel a gap  <br/>
and are choosing something that intrigues them to fill it with. WIth  <br/>
kids it&#39;s an adult seeing what they believe is a gap and imposing on  <br/>
the child something the adult finds intriguing. That&#39;s the purpose of  <br/>
schools: to see weaknesses, imperfections, gaps and let experts fill  <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
If she enjoys yoga, and the classes are fun, do it because you think  <br/>
she might have fun not because you want to improve an imperfection  <br/>
(flabby brain potential).<br/>
<br/>
Are the people in LA way more happy than the rest of the country  <br/>
because they have all these programs to fill in gaps from a very  <br/>
young age? Or is there perhaps more worry that they are so full of  <br/>
gaps that experts have identified in people and they haven&#39;t found  <br/>
the right programs to fix them?<br/>

I don&#39;t understand this statement.  What we ARE &quot;supposed&quot; to do as unschoolers is to help our kids develop their deepest interests.  Who is saying that that ISN&#39;T what we&#39;re supposed to do--you, or someone that doesn&#39;t understand unschooling?

Right--but someone might be raising a potential scientist, artist, musician or car mechanic, because that is where their child&#39;s interests lay--and then they WOULD by trying to do that.  There seem to be a lot of ethical limits in your thinking about unschooling.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-Practicing mindfulness is great, for adults.  Children who&#39;ve been free to explore and play and *be* who they are, are the most mindful beings I&#39;ve ever seen--have you ever really watched a young one play with bubbles? Or sift sand through a strainer?  That is full-body, full-brain mindful meditation even the Dali Lama would appreciate!-=-<br/>
<br/>
I agree completely.  The idea of teaching &quot;mindfulness&quot; to a child is a twisting and a complication of the point of the whole thing!  The more I think about it, the more it bothers me--as if we adults have discovered some really great thing that can &quot;improve&quot; on childhood.  I think I trust millions of years of evolution, thank you very much!  Next there will be medications that help children to be more &quot;mindful.&quot;  Or a tea they can drink.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2115556664">-=-For me, there are two sides to this: 1) our intention and 2) our  <br/>
expectation<br/>
<br/>
-=-If our intention is to somehow &quot;improve&quot; on our children, then  <br/>
we&#39;re on the wrong path.<br/>
<br/>
-=-If our expectation is for them to use the object or information in  <br/>
a specific way, then we&#39;re on the wrong path as well.-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s too strongly stated for my tastes.<br/>
Sometimes people (children or adults) need specific information for a  <br/>
particular purpose.<br/>
Some objects and information ARE for specific purposes.<br/>
