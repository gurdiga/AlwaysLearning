&quot;I just wanted to send you an email letting you know I purchased a  <br/>
copy of your book at Kirby&#39;s recommendation. :)  I&#39;m his new  <br/>
supervisor at work, and we were talking about the fact that you  <br/>
&#39;unschooled&#39; him.  My best friend Mike is currently going to school  <br/>
for a teaching degree and he wrote a paper on the subject, which we  <br/>
both found very interesting.  I also wanted to add that Kirby is the  <br/>
first &#39;home-schooled&#39; person I&#39;ve met who didn&#39;t exude social  <br/>

sweetheart and a pleasure to work with. You must be very proud! :D   <br/>
Anyways, I decided to buy your book for Mike as part of his birthday  <br/>
gift so he can learn more about the topic from an expert. &quot;<br/>

As nice as the note is, have the rest of you met homeschoolers who  <br/>
exuded social awkwardness from every pore?  I haven&#39;t.<br/>

I don&#39;t want to argue with someone who&#39;s totally bragging up my kid,  <br/>

Not one.  I started a homeschool soccer league last spring and had the pleasure of meeting 60 or so kids (plus siblings and families) from all age groups. (we even fielded a U19 team, so I had players from age 4 to 19 :)  While I am in the middle of bible country (no offense anyone!) and most of these kids are not necessarily &#39;unschoolers&#39; (like my family is)(okay - none of them are :) , I found them all a joy to be around.  It was the most amazing group of kids.  We had  (have) coed teams and to see the older kids together without the usual steryotypical &#39;teenager&#39; type behavior was refreshing.  They were fantastic &#39;young adults&#39; who did not seem worried about dating and gossiping, or embarrased at hanging out with their families,  etc ... they just all had a great time being together.  Its a very recreational league (but we play against the various schools) and we had all the teams practice at  the same park with multiple fields, on the same date, etc..... we had one family with 7 kids and they all got to play due to this convienience.  The families could watch ALL their kids practice at the same time, same place, and it was such a great environment. (and a very diverse group) <br/>
I heard my mom say something about a &#39;nerdy&#39; kid recently, and boy did she get an earful  :)  I just dont think like that, and dont appreciate people who do.  I wonder how many people wouldnt say those &#39;socially awkward&#39; comments if they didnt know in advance that the kids were homeschooled.  I feel most of these comments in general represent the &#39;high school&#39; mentality that unfortunaltely most cant shake upon graduation.  We all know those adults who seem like they are still in attendance socially.  :)<br/>

sisters and I don&#39;t think any of us are more socially awkward than anyone<br/>
else I&#39;ve met - all six of us are married which I think implies a certain<br/>
amount of ability to form relationships.<br/>
<br/>
Having said that I know - online - a fair number of people who are home<br/>
educating children because their &#39;socially awkward&#39; behaviour made them<br/>
unable to function in school; autistic children, for example. I expect a<br/>
number of them will still be socially awkward when they&#39;re adult.<br/>

On thinking about those kids, they were almost always from school-at-home, strict, fundemental christian families, and had had very limited social experiences and general contact with regular daily activities.  I would also have to say that a few of the parents would also fall under that description as well.</div>

Oh I have, not unschoolers, but homeschoolers absolutely.  Most of their parents are very strict, very religious, school-at-homers. <br/>
I can think of 3 families that I know personally, and then quite a few of the local homeschool group are like that.  They fit the stereotype of the awkward, shy, geeky homeschooler to a T.   And in one of the families, the only child (of 7) who was not like that was a real bully.  She was so mean to my son (and the mom didn&#39;t care, &quot;just kids&quot;) that we avoided the family as much as we could (they went to my son&#39;s TaeKwonDo academy).  They were Air Force, moved to Germany.  <br/>
<br/>
But yes, I think that before going to an unschooling conference, I had actually met more homeschoolers that were like that than were not.  <br/>

<br/>
To the same extent that I&#39;ve met awkward school kids!  Honestly, I find it way <br/>
more awkward to pass teenagers in the park and have them exude that &quot;ew parents&quot; <br/>
and &quot;I&#39;m a cool teenager&quot; vibe.  I find that very off putting!  Something that <br/>
very few homeschoolers do.  I guess if you are an adult who is used to talking <br/>
to kids as if they are &quot;less than&quot;, you may find homeschoolers put you in a <br/>
socially awkward position.  They may actually expect you to talk to them as if <br/>
they are real people, and not &quot;kids&quot; or &quot;teenagers&quot;.  That makes some adults <br/>
feel very awkward!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-191939867">In this case, I would definitely think it&#39;s not the homeschooling but<br/>
the parent&#39;s worldview, which the kids are probably obliged to agree<br/>
to. With schoolthink, it&#39;s not much different. Kids, whether they&#39;re<br/>
homeschoolers or not, might behave or seem to feel as though they have<br/>
a separation to maintain. To some degree, that is natural just because<br/>
there *are* differences. There IS a great deal of diversity. And like<br/>
Jenny says, some people aren&#39;t comfortable with that.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t matter whether someone is school-at-home, unschooling or at<br/>
public/private/charter/boarding school, it&#39;s possible to cultivate a<br/>
feeling that the children and parents are part of this world. Maybe<br/>
not everybody can do that.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also just as possible to cultivate a feeling that<br/>
children/parents are separate from large areas in a world of<br/>
diversity, and are perhaps a cut above. Social awkwardness can be<br/>
exaggerated by fears of different unknowns. Almost anybody can do<br/>
that.<br/>

<br/>
I was at our playgroup just last week, three 4 year olds and my daughter, just about to turn 3. We all met at La Leche and formed the group as the kids grew. All of the kids are in or heading to school already and the moms asked if I still plan to homeschool. (I told them about unschooling some time ago, but they didn&#39;t reference it, just homeschooling). When I said yes, one of the moms informed me that all of the homeschooled kids she met in college were absolutely socially bizarre. To which another mom responded that perhaps they came from very religious and strict homes. <br/>
<br/>
It was all news to me that made me scratch my head. I wondered, for a moment, what I would have to do to avoid such a future description of my daughter.  Then I let it go.<br/>

<br/>
I think Dylan may be thought by some to be socially awkward.   I don&#39;t see it as awkwardness so much as a dislike of foolishness.   There are some people he&#39;s not interested in talking to.  That used to bother me but then I considered that as an adult he would be talking to the people he wanted to and avoiding people he didn&#39;t.   He has very little patience with bullshit and with people who are full of themselves.   I don&#39;t think it&#39;s awful that he doesn&#39;t bother with them. <br/>
<br/>
I used to be worried that people would think he was socially awkward and that would reflect badly on me.&lt;g&gt;   But when I think about the times he&#39;s avoided some situations or some people I can see that he had good reason.   There are family members he&#39;d rather not see.  I&#39;m ok with that.  They&#39;re really aren&#39;t a pleasure to be with.   We have one friend he actively avoids.  She has had a lot of hardship and in that way that some injured people survive by becoming self obsessed she is so full of herself that it&#39;s hard to talk with her.  And she draws her injuries like a dagger in the course of conversation so that, no matter what the topic, it comes round to her particular suffering.  I understand how she got that way.  It doesn&#39;t make her easier to be around.    <br/>
<br/>
And we have a family member who is all new agey and LoA-ish and has an agenda every time she talks, especially with young people, she sees herself as a guide.   Dylan avoids her.  He does not like her leading questions.  Of the two she seems more socially awkward, not understanding or caring she&#39;s crossing personal boundaries. <br/>
<br/>
So what is awkward?  If you have nothing in common with a crowd of young people who are using language for shock value and say things they think sound cool and you&#39;re not interested in hearing about the latest kegger and who puked, are you socially awkward?   If you don&#39;t want to answer questions that are none of the questioner&#39;s business, does that make you socially awkward?   If a person is just so full of shit you don&#39;t want to talk to them, are you socially awkward?    I think some people expect to be found fascinating, no matter how obnoxious or offensive they really are,  and if someone doesn&#39;t find them so, that person must be socially awkward.    <br/>
<br/>
Dylan really enjoys talking with intelligent, clever people.  He doesn&#39;t enjoy crowds of people.   He doesn&#39;t enjoy small talk and silliness.   Maybe that qualifies him as socially awkward but he&#39;s ok with it. &lt;g&gt;   If he was older and rich and successful he&#39;d be called &quot;discerning&quot; instead of &quot;&quot;socially awkward. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The people I know personally who are the most socially awkward were public schooled.   Because socialization has been the boogeyman of homeschooling for decades, shy or introverted people who were homeschooled must have been made shy and introverted by the homeschooling.  Shy or introverted people in school were just weirdo&#39;s.  <br/>

friend who had a small house, who had arranged for us to stay with a  <br/>
friend of his who had a bigger, nicer house.   I was a little nervous  <br/>
about that, but willing.<br/>

At that time I had no experience with unschooling a kid that old,  <br/>
though I knew a few kids nearly his age.    i was still full of  <br/>
memories of the way 7th graders acted, though, and he was about that  <br/>
age.<br/>
I went in, met his mom, and when the boy walked away I said, &quot;He&#39;s  <br/>
homeschooled, right?&quot;   She said, &quot;How did you know!?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I could tell because he talked to me like a human talks to a human.   <br/>
He was nice, direct, not second-guessing himself, not self-conscious.   <br/>
And he wasn&#39;t embarrassed about his clothes not being fashionable or  <br/>
not &quot;fitting him right.&quot;    He wasn&#39;t unschooled; they were Chrisitan  <br/>
homeschoolers, but neither strict nor fundamentalist.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen my own kids be that way many times since.  There have been  <br/>
people who guessed that my kids were homeschooling, even without  <br/>
meeting them out in public during school hours. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t guess I doubt there are &quot;unsocialized&quot; kids.  I just don&#39;t  <br/>
think I&#39;ve met any.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1502224690">So you went to public school for 8years and only homeschooled for 4? yet you associate your social awkwardness with the homeschooling portion?  I would be careful to apply the term &#39;socially awkward&#39; to people who are shy.  shyness is just that sometimes- shyness.  On another group someone mentioned their &#39;shy &#39; child and the responses of &#39;oh they might have autism, or this or that &#39; were just baffling.   Its ok to be shy, and many are, and it usually has nothing to do with being homeschooled or awkward.  <br/>

On thinking about those kids, they were almost always from school-at-home, strict, fundemental christian families, and had had very limited social experiences and general contact with regular daily activities.

&gt; *** homeschoolers who exuded social awkwardness from every pore?***<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think Dylan may be thought by some to be socially awkward.   I don&#39;t see it as awkwardness so much as a dislike of foolishness.   There are some people he&#39;s not interested in talking to.  That used to bother me but then I considered that as an adult he would be talking to the people he wanted to and avoiding people he didn&#39;t.   He has very little patience with bullshit and with people who are full of themselves.   I don&#39;t think it&#39;s awful that he doesn&#39;t bother with them. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I used to be worried that people would think he was socially awkward and that would reflect badly on me.&lt;g&gt;   But when I think about the times he&#39;s avoided some situations or some people I can see that he had good reason.   There are family members he&#39;d rather not see.  I&#39;m ok with that.  They&#39;re really aren&#39;t a pleasure to be with.   We have one friend he actively avoids.  She has had a lot of hardship and in that way that some injured people survive by becoming self obsessed she is so full of herself that it&#39;s hard to talk with her.  And she draws her injuries like a dagger in the course of conversation so that, no matter what the topic, it comes round to her particular suffering.  I understand how she got that way.  It doesn&#39;t make her easier to be around.    <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And we have a family member who is all new agey and LoA-ish and has an agenda every time she talks, especially with young people, she sees herself as a guide.   Dylan avoids her.  He does not like her leading questions.  Of the two she seems more socially awkward, not understanding or caring she&#39;s crossing personal boundaries. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So what is awkward?  If you have nothing in common with a crowd of young people who are using language for shock value and say things they think sound cool and you&#39;re not interested in hearing about the latest kegger and who puked, are you socially awkward?   If you don&#39;t want to answer questions that are none of the questioner&#39;s business, does that make you socially awkward?   If a person is just so full of shit you don&#39;t want to talk to them, are you socially awkward?    I think some people expect to be found fascinating, no matter how obnoxious or offensive they really are,  and if someone doesn&#39;t find them so, that person must be socially awkward.    <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dylan really enjoys talking with intelligent, clever people.  He doesn&#39;t enjoy crowds of people.   He doesn&#39;t enjoy small talk and silliness.   Maybe that qualifies him as socially awkward but he&#39;s ok with it. &lt;g&gt;   If he was older and rich and successful he&#39;d be called &quot;discerning&quot; instead of &quot;&quot;socially awkward. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The people I know personally who are the most socially awkward were public schooled.   Because socialization has been the boogeyman of homeschooling for decades, shy or introverted people who were homeschooled must have been made shy and introverted by the homeschooling.  Shy or introverted people in school were just weirdo&#39;s.  <br/>

to lack of social skills, there&#39;s a huge element of control.<br/>

I&#39;m afraid I have become one of those people who was public schooled and is socially awkward. I&#39;m an introvert by nature, however the way I coped with public school was forcing myself to *act* very extroverted. I did this *acting* through to about 11th grade, but was so exhausted by pretending to be someone I wasn&#39;t for fear of being one of those &quot;weirdo&quot; kids, that I sort of burnt out, and cut off most of my friendships, and stopped pursuing a very social life. <br/>
<br/>
Those years of not listening to myself, and putting myself out there when I really just wanted to read off in a corner, are still being processed 7+ years later (eg. I only just realized I&#39;m a true introvert, thanks to an article link posted here the other day~). I find I&#39;m *very* protective of my personal space to the point where I either don&#39;t engage much in social settings, or I feel somehow like I&#39;m &#39;acting&#39;. <br/>
<br/>
Reading all you unschooler&#39;s posts, it comes across that you&#39;re all so &#39;with it&#39; and confident, over your baggage etc. <br/>
<br/>
In deschooling myself in preparation of unschooling my son (who is still a baby, although I have *lots* of deschooling to do which this list has been very helpful with), do you think it&#39;s imperative to overcome my awkwardness around socializing? Do I first have to become &quot;baggage-free&quot; before unschooling will work for my family?<br/>

bizarre AND said kids may have seen no need to constantly announce their<br/>
religious views, sexual orientation, former educational status, or city of<br/>
origin.<br/>
<br/>
One of our family stories concerns when my oldest (now 31) was attending<br/>
community college and a professor asked him where he went to high school.<br/>
My not out as an unschooler or as hearing impaired son&#39;s response was<br/>
&quot;why&quot;?  Turns out professor wanted to know how my son had such great math<br/>
intuition and wondered how he was &quot;taught&quot;.   My son did come out to that<br/>
professor and they had some good talks about how much damage needed to be<br/>
undone for students with years and years of arithmetic and supposed<br/>
mathematics pushed in high school.   Even back then part of the reason not<br/>
to come out was no desire to be linked to some of the school at home<br/>
weirdos.<br/>

P.S.:  Yes, &quot;some&quot; homeschooled kids are socially awkward in institutional<br/>

settings.   And sometimes siblings in very similar home environments end up<br/>
with different levels of social comfort.  Next?<br/>

Good grief, no! While personal baggage can get in the way of relationships, its also part of being human - and our kids are human, growing up with human needs and human baggage. Watching parents work through personal junk can be really helpful for kids with junk of their own. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If your awkwardness is getting in your kids&#39; way, that&#39;s something to look for solutions for - but overcoming your awkwardness is only one way for that to happen. Finding other people who can support your kids in social situations is another. And some kids have a whole lot of &quot;social intelligence&quot; to begin with - that can be a solution right there. Think of yourself as a potential limit - how can you help your kids get what they want around that limit? <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; In deschooling myself in preparation of unschooling my son<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Keep in mind that you probably won&#39;t be &quot;done&quot; deschooling before your son gets to &quot;school age&quot;. There may well be issues that come up when he&#39;s 5, 7, 15... that you won&#39;t even think about before-hand, or that you&#39;ll think &quot;I can handle that&quot; until faced with the reality of your kids mirroring your bad habits and least-lovable traits at you (eeek!). Its takes a bit of personal growth to start unschooling, but unschooling is also a wonderful source of personal growth for parents. <br/>

It&#39;s not &quot;imperative to overcome it,&quot; but it sure does help that  <br/>
you&#39;re aware of it and thinking about it!<br/>

You don&#39;t need to be &quot;baggage free&quot; but if you were totally in baggage  <br/>

&gt; So you went to public school for 8years and only homeschooled for 4? yet you associate your social awkwardness with the homeschooling portion?  I would be careful to apply the term &#39;socially awkward&#39; to people who are shy.  shyness is just that sometimes- shyness.  On another group someone mentioned their &#39;shy &#39; child and the responses of &#39;oh they might have autism, or this or that &#39; were just baffling.   Its ok to be shy, and many are, and it usually has nothing to do with being homeschooled or awkward.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t say I was homeschooled for 4 years *therefore* I was socially awkward.  I said I was homeschooled for 4 years *AND* I was socially awkward.  To answer Sandra&#39;s question, yes I have met socially awkward homeschoolers.  <br/>
<br/>
Yes, I was also naturally shy, however I felt more socially comfortable in K-4th grade in private school and later in private school and public highschool than I did in those 4 years of homeschooling.  This is not a reflection on homeschooling necessarily, this is a reflection on a combination of my natural personality combined with little opportunity for social interaction during those homeschooling years.  <br/>
<br/>
In that small town, with few activities available outside of school, and religious parents who may or may not have approved of non-religious friends, it is entirely possible I would have had the same experience had I attended public school for those few years.  After all, public school *in itself* is not a great place for social interaction.  Those opportunities come up after school and in sports and girl scouts etc.  Things I did not do.  When I was younger the opportunities came through the church we went to the ran the private school, but that was no longer an option during those 4 homeschooled years.    <br/>
<br/>
In my other post I also said that I have met socially awkward public schooled kids and that it is a combination of factors.  Those were the combination of factors *for me* that led to social awkwardness.  <br/>

<br/>
One time a guy came to our house trying to get signatures for something.  I was <br/>
out doing yard work.  It was a school related something or other signature and <br/>
I&#39;d said something about not wanting to sign it because I felt that schools were <br/>
grossly over funded already and I didn&#39;t even use them anyway because my kids <br/>
were homeschooled, they were out and about and it was school hours.  I honestly <br/>
don&#39;t remember the particulars, but I do remember him saying, as he followed me <br/>
around my yard, that &quot;kids needed to be in school to learn social behavior&quot;, and <br/>
I said &quot;NO they don&#39;t&quot;, to which he replied, &quot;yes they do, it&#39;s just the facts <br/>
ma&#39;am.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
At that moment, I had half an inclination to spank him with my shovel or <br/>
whatever it was I was holding.  I was thinking about how rude it was for him to <br/>
argue with me in MY yard trying to get me to sign his petition after I&#39;d already <br/>
said &quot;no&quot;.  Gosh, he must have learned those social skills in school!<br/>
