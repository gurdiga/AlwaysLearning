<div id="ygrps-yiv-1276292290">While I can&#39;t answer for all of the newfangled wood stoves out there, about<br/>
10 years ago dh and I heated our small ranch exclusively with wood with an<br/>
old box-style woodstove somebody had in their garage.  We put it in the<br/>
basement (where the chimney already had a hole to put the woodstove pipe).<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t hard keeping the fire going all night.  We got a good fire going<br/>
in the evening, loaded the stove as full as possible, and turned the damper<br/>
way down so it burned slowly.  We&#39;d usually wake up to a nice pile of coals<br/>
in the morning with which to add more logs.<br/>
<br/>
Kept our house in the high 70&#39;s all winter (small newer house, well<br/>
insulated).<br/>
