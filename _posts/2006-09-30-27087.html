<div id="ygrps-yiv-1678366691">My daughter and I had some great fun yesterday perming one of her barbie&#39;s hair. We had a book out of the library on doll makeovers, and I was fascinated by the amazing stuff those enthusiasts do!<br/>
<br/>
It was fairly easy and very successful. I was just as thrilled as Vivi! We started off with a barbie with long straight hair. Her hair wasn&#39;t in very good condition, it was quite fluffy and a bit matted. We coated the hair in gel, divided into small sections and then rolled them onto bits of drinking straws, secured by pipe cleaners, pinning them to her head to secure. Next was dunking her head in boiling water for 18 seconds, then icy water for a few seconds. We left her to dry and then took the rollers out. She now has beautiful spiral curls.<br/>
<br/>
We went to rock&#39;n&#39;roll dancing last night (a homeschool group thing) and took the barbie to show her off. The main response from the other homeschooling parents was that it was a rather bizzare idea and pretty pointless (the kids thought it was real cool). There was a bit of eye rolling, especially at me being so excited about it. I thought it was sad that they couldn&#39;t see the value in my sharing the experience with my daughter, the love and joy that it had brought us.<br/>

with doll hair besides cut it off. Ooooooh. Aaaaaaah. I bet it would <br/>
work with &quot;My Little Pony&quot; hair, too - Mo just loves that style of toy <br/>
horse right now. <br/>
Wow, I can feel my mind Expanding....<br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s a book called Who are You People? A Personal Journey into the  <br/>
Heart of Fanatical Passion in America, by Shari Caudron.  She has a  <br/>
website and blog about it.  But the first chapter is about the author  <br/>
going to a Barbie collectors&#39; convention in Denver.  And she is given  <br/>
the collectible conference doll, and though she had been cynical and  <br/>
negative about lots of things before, she really had fun at the place  <br/>
and knows the cool details, like what doll it commemorates (the  <br/>
original Malibu Barbie), and that this is the first one to come with  <br/>
sunscreen.<br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;m going to quote her:<br/>
<br/>
A week later, I&#39;m in the backyard talking with friends about my  <br/>
experience at the Barbie convention.  Without stopping to question  <br/>
the wisdom of my actions, I rush upstairs, grab my brand-new, in-the- <br/>
box, convention-issue Malibu Barbie and return to the table.  One  <br/>
friend, a veteran court reporter who&#39;s spent years listening to true- <br/>
life cases of murder, dismemberment and sexual assault, takes one  <br/>
look at the doll and recoils.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Get that thing out of here,&quot; she says.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s as if I&#39;ve just displayed a rusty set of medieval dental pliers  <br/>
and told her to open wide.  No amount of talking on my part can  <br/>
convince her that Barbie collectors are indeed a happy, harmless bunch.<br/>
<br/>
-------------------end of quote-----------------------------<br/>
<br/>
There is some belief among negative and cynical people that it&#39;s a  <br/>
sign of intelligence to see the rest of the world as &quot;stupid.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Bummer.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1726603984">Oh my gosh, thank you!  I have wondered for quite some time what to do with frizzy Barbie hair.  The boiling/icy water thing is fascinating, it must change the texture.  Would you mind posting the title of the makeover book?  I&#39;d Googled Barbie makeover before, but never got any good looking hits, and never thought there would be a whole book dedicated to it, silly me.<br/>
<br/>
Also, regarding Barbie and stupidity (in reference to Sandra&#39;s post), Barbie brought pulleys into our life recently, since the girls wanted to create a Barbie elevator out of a Costco-size Fruitloops box.  I can&#39;t imagine that learning about pulleys, the weight capacity of string from the hardware store, and the number of Barbies it would take to exceed that weight capacity would somehow be associated with stupidity!!  <br/>

The hair didn&#39;t change texture. I was a bit worried about putting her head<br/>
in the boiling water, I thought she might melt, or her face paint might come<br/>
off! But, no, she was better than new! The surface of the curls aren&#39;t as<br/>
smooth and shiny as the pictures in the book. They were on a doll with<br/>
as-new hair. But they still look great. I can email you a photo if you like.<br/>

<br/>
You can use a similar technique for saving frazzled paint (or makeup)<br/>
brushes. We just dip them briefly in boiling water (just the hairs,<br/>
not the ferrule) and it tends to straighten out a brush that might<br/>
otherwise be on it&#39;s way to brush heaven....:)<br/>

whose faces aren&#39;t so nice anymore, so it might be a good idea to  <br/>
give them a boiling water treatment, but I&#39;ll get the book first.<br/>

<br/>
Instead of discussing what we&#39;re going to discuss, just DISCUSS, send  <br/>
links, provide useful information in every single post!  Hundreds of  <br/>
readers want you to.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone can put up ideas and links and suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s great!!<br/>
<br/>
Less great:<br/>

a post of &quot; I could send you all some links if you are  interested.  <br/>

And seeing my daughter light up with pleasure turned out to be pretty high on the list - I value her joy.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">In the longer term, it helped me to read things like the Barbie page and know that my daughter&#39;s interest in a pink plastic toy wasn&#39;t going to warp her into someone I didn&#39;t want to be around. And it helped me to watch her, listen to her, and see and hear the stories she told and played, which weren&#39;t the stories I&#39;d feared.<span style="background-color:transparent;line-height:1.22;">&nbsp;From My Little Pony she moved on to the Barbie movies - omg have you seen the Barbie movies? Women saving the day, saving princes, saving friends, saving the world, embracing difference, challenging the status quo &nbsp;- yeah, I know, irony, but one of the things I learned from my daughter along the way was that Barbies are toys and cartoons. Real ponies don&#39;t have purple hair and cutie marks, and real girls don&#39;t have those wacky proportions.<br><br>Mo&#39;s 12, now. She&#39;s not much interested in Barbie these days, but she&#39;s gone back to her love of My Little Pony, having found the comic book series. She loves those - and I&#39;ve gotten into them too. They&#39;re good stories full of surprisingly complex characters and a good sense of humor. She also has a massive crush on Shadow the Hedgehog - darkly handsome, tragic, misunderstood... oh, my! He&#39;s her man. Right now there&#39;s a picture of Mo-the-Hedgehog kissing Shadow under the mistletoe as the wallpaper on my desktop. She writes some fan fiction - and in her stories she&#39;s not some shopping bimbo or wimpy princess needing help, she&#39;s helping save the day, sometimes saving Shadow in the process.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span style="background-color:transparent;line-height:1.22;"><br></span></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">Get your daughter a Barbie. Get her one of the movies, too - find one with something she likes in them, music or painting or mermaid or fairies or flying horses (oh! that&#39;s how Mo got from MLP to Barbie - the Pegasus movie!). Some are remakes of very traditional stories - Swan Lake, Rapunzel, The Princess and the Pauper (that might be a good one for you to start with!), The Twelve Dancing Princesses, The Three Musketeers - redone with female heroines.</p></div>

<br/>
Well you&#39;re online now reading that your child is more important than negativity shared to stir up indignation because many people enjoy the feeling of negative indignation.  They are opposed, and they don&#39;t like things and they swear senseless oaths.<br/>
<br/>
Will you pick pissed-off stranger online over your sweet daughter?<br/>
<br/>
-=- I am a wooden toy lover I will say from the outset and that’s what we predominantly have in our home. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I like wooden toys, and have bought many, and saved some that my kids had when they were very young.  <br/>
I am not, in way of my own identity, &quot;a wood toy lover.&quot;  <br/>
Do not love ANYTHING more than you love your child, and what your child loves.  <br/>
Do not (if you want unschooling to work) try to make your daughter more like you, and less like herself.  <br/>
<br/>
-=- I have worked hard at separating my views and opinions from our children’s desires-=-<br/>
<br/>
It shouldn&#39;t be such hard work.  If you accept the principle that learning is everywhere and your daughter&#39;s happiness is more important that the politics of strangers, then you should be able to relax into your children&#39;s desires and that will BE your view.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s hard work, you&#39;re not making the changes that will enable you to flow along with them, in their real world, which might not match the fantasy of wooden toys and prejudices coming true.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I have realised that my feelings about this toy have overpowered our decisions.

-=-<br/>
<br/>
That was at the end of a paragraph that started off with your long opposition, oaths and &quot;I still don&#39;t like them.&quot;<br/>
Your daughters know that.<br/>
You can&#39;t pretend to change.  You must actually change.<br/>

Sandra&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</font></p></div></div></div></div></blockquote><div>My daughter and son are past the age at which Barbie is cool any more.  We had a wooden dollhouse with all of the wooden dolls which my daughter and son found quite uninteresting.  I had fantasies about my children spending hours playing with these plain looking toys imaginatively.  They weren&#39;t colorful or soft or any fun to my children....  So, we got rid of the wood toys and my fantasies and I paid attention to what my children enjoyed when we went to the fancy toy stores that had all of those toys out for children to play with.  </div>
<div><br></div><div>My daughter&#39;s first Barbie came from a relative.  She was very young (3 or 4), but loved bright, colorful toys that were pretty.  At the time pink was her favorite color and the more color the better!  At the time, I was not overly impressed with Barbie, but my daughter loved playing with her and her other dolls.  She loved pretty clothes and fashion.  Her favorites were soft sculpture dolls called &quot;Groovy Girls&quot;.  They were friendly teenaged looking soft dolls with lots of nifty clothes.  My children (and I ) spent hours playing imaginatively with all of those dolls and all of the stuff that went with those dolls.  The learning that went with the dolls was amazing!<br>
</div><div><br></div><div>Fast forward to now.... My daughter is 15 and very self possessed.  She was telling me the other day how terrible Barbie is for a girl&#39;s self concept.  That all of the messages sent by the unrealistic body shape was just not good!  We then had a long, interesting discussion about how she managed to grow up thinking that her body was just fine, beautiful even...   And the learning that went with that discussion was amazing!</div>

years, so playing with Barbie as a little girl&nbsp; did not make me flighty or 
sexually promiscuous. Actually my interest in fashion dolls as a child led to an 
interest in fashion and sewing in my teens and 20s.&nbsp; I’m essentially a self 
taught sewer. Throughout high school and college and grad school as I studied 
literature, wrote poetry, taught high school and college English, I also sewed 
for myself and for children I knew. When my daughter was a baby and I was alone 
at home with her, I taught myself how to make curtains and slip covers and then 
earned extra money sewing them for other moms in the neighborhood.&nbsp; In my 
early 40s I started collecting Barbies again and I funded my hobby by sewing 
professionally for dolls. I am now designing doll clothes for adult collectors 
and am well known in the doll world and win competitions for contemporary and 
historic fashion designs. I’ve learned lots about the history of clothing and 
costume pursuing this hobby. I stopped teaching when I had my child, and now I 
am doing what I love as I unschool my daughter. She sees me doing the work that 
I taught myself to do and that encourages her to realize that she can pursue her 
own interests and that they are valuable.&nbsp; My daughter,now 15, has been 
unschooled since she was 10. She adored princess Barbies as a little girl and 
she still likes dolls but is not in any way interested in fashion or obsessed 
with her own appearance. She still likes Monster High dolls but is now more 
interested in creating cartoon art and working on the computer.&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Barbie does not have to be a bad influence on girls. In fact, Barbie was 
actually the first doll that emphasized that girls could be more than mothers. 
The lady who invented Barbie was a founder of Mattel – she was a working 
professional woman.&nbsp; She presented Barbie as a working fashion model, a 
fashion designer, a&nbsp; teacher, a nurse, an astronaut, a college student, an 
actress all before 1965. After that Barbie’s and women’s career choices 
exploded. I admit that I also worried a bit as Katy grew up whether my 
collection of pretty dolls (Barbie and 16” fashion dolls) and my hobby of making 
pretty clothes would make her think pretty was all that mattered for women. But 
since I was a slightly dumpy woman in her 40s and 50s with glasses, dressed 
perpetually in jeans and black shirts I think she realized that real women don’t 
look like dolls.&nbsp; I always told my daughter that dolls had no insides so 
all their pretty had to be on the outside because that’s all they have. They are 
works of fantasy and art and not images of what a woman must look like. Let your 
child play with a Barbie. You might be surprised to see what that play can lead 
to.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></div></div></html></div>

Sandra&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</font></p></div></div></div></div></blockquote><div>My daughter and son are past the age at which Barbie is cool any more. &nbsp;We had a wooden dollhouse with all of the wooden dolls which my daughter and son found quite uninteresting. &nbsp;I had fantasies about my children spending hours playing with these plain looking toys imaginatively. &nbsp;They weren&#39;t colorful or soft or any fun to my children.... &nbsp;So, we got rid of the wood toys and my fantasies and I paid attention to what my children enjoyed when we went to the fancy toy stores that had all of those toys out for children to play with. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br></div><div>My daughter&#39;s first Barbie came from a relative. &nbsp;She was very young (3 or 4), but loved bright, colorful toys that were pretty. &nbsp;At the time pink was her favorite color and the more color the better! &nbsp;At the time, I was not overly impressed with Barbie, but my daughter loved playing with her and her other dolls. &nbsp;She loved pretty clothes and fashion. &nbsp;Her favorites were soft sculpture dolls called &quot;Groovy Girls&quot;. &nbsp;They were friendly teenaged looking soft dolls with lots of nifty clothes. &nbsp;My children (and I ) spent hours playing imaginatively with all of those dolls and all of the stuff that went with those dolls. &nbsp;The learning that went with the dolls was amazing!<br>
</div><div><br></div><div>Fast forward to now.... My daughter is 15 and very self possessed. &nbsp;She was telling me the other day how terrible Barbie is for a girl&#39;s self concept. &nbsp;That all of the messages sent by the unrealistic body shape was just not good! &nbsp;We then had a long, interesting discussion about how she managed to grow up thinking that her body was just fine, beautiful even... &nbsp; And the learning that went with that discussion was amazing!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-461678518"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I reckon I can learn to live with Barbie and its very freeing.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I read this the other day on Just Add Light and Stir, and it has really stuck with me.  It&#39;s about ice cream, but to me it could be about anything our children are enjoying.<br/>
<br/>
The title of the post is &quot;Don&#39;t taint the ice cream&quot; and it goes on to say:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It creates a trap, a trick question, an adversarial relationship, an opportunity for failure, if there is &quot;a right answer&quot; to the question &quot;What do you want to eat?&quot; Or if an overjoyed &quot;can I have some ice cream?&quot; is met with a sigh, and eyes rolling, and another sigh, and a dirty look, and a summary of what the child has already eaten that day, and a reminder of when the next meal is, and a head shake, and a mention of ingredients... or even ONE of those, it taints the ice cream. It harms the relationship. It makes the child smaller. It does not, correspondingly, though, make the parent larger.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If we, as parents, can do more than &quot;learn to live&quot; with something our children are interested in...if we can learn to truly embrace our children&#39;s interests, delight in their curiosity around anything - even (and maybe especially) those things we might have a historic distaste for - then we can move several steps closer to a more meaningful, lasting relationship.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1552084678"><div dir="ltr"><div>sorry that earlier message went out from my phone:( apologies.</div><div><br></div>Veda a bit over 4 is quite into My little pony and Barbie and slowly getting into Monster high.<div>Besides the fact that MLP stuff is just not available in India, plus a lot of the videos are blocked because of ip address issues:(..it has just been a world of discovery and new learning all the way.</div>
<div><br></div><div>Some of the things that have come up in relation to opposition to her Barbie, MLP love has really just been the reaction of one of her &quot;friends&#39;&quot; mom who is very concerned about &quot;over exposure&quot; to mature stuff &quot;earlier&quot; on.This particular child does go to mainstream school, so chances are slim that she might not encounter barbie over there..but in any case the mom brought it up  with me in particular and it led to some interesting events.</div>

<div><br></div><div>While initially I was a bit about &quot;whatever Veda wants&quot;, this particular child is very much liked by daughter and it has helped coaching Veda in terms of not exactly watching those videos ( not so much barbie as much as MLP) when that particular child comes to play along with her mom. Veda doesn&#39;t seem to mind since there&#39;s a lot of other options for them to choose from but videos like these that are considered &quot;dangerous&quot; have helped her and me understand about choices, respecting others preferences and not necessarily talking about topics that might  offend others (moms included). Its led to lots of talking about why people might not like monster high and MLP and Veda came up with the idea that &quot;people might think they are scary or something&quot; which I thought was pretty good logic for her age:).We talk all the time so its been a process of trying to piece together what makes it work while sharing some of this stuff with friends especially when we dont exactly live in a community that has any unschoolers/homeschoolers in our complex especially since thats where we spend pretty much most or all of our time for a variety of reasons. </div>
<div><br></div><div>I was myself a little concerned by the language usage not so much about how how it would influence her, but more so her using it inappropriately and more so inadvertantly, but it hasn&#39;t happened so far yet What has happened is discoveryof  a variety of use of voices and accents and imitation of the various girls talking styles, clothe styles, dressing styles, dance videos, artwork, pinterest, discovery of youtube videos where children post videos playing with MLP toys using a variety of dialogues, own scripts and she enjoys watching these and re-enacting them herself. </div>

<div><br></div><div>Actually barbie is quite popular here in India, so there are quite a few many older children in our complex that enjoy the barbie stuff with Veda including the make up, the mobile app games, the colouring book, the clothes etc.Some moms do rant about Barbie and their sexiness but I think Barbie pales in comparison to some of the crass Bollywood dishes out to kids and Indian children are exposed to that often very early on so its a bit ironic in reality:)</div>
<div><br></div><div>The movie about Odette- the animation was done in Chennai which led to conversations myself and her and her dad about animation, Hollywood and Chennai (we have family in chennai). While she might not exactly get all the parts of the movie  we have been treated to many a private performances of ballet by Veda. We ended making a tutu that didn&#39;t turn out so great since the material wasn&#39;t the right one, but that was an enjoyable experience in itself. Barbie was the color inspiration for our fake Christmas tree this year. Rainbow dash was the color theme for our Diwali Rangoli this November.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1917052127"><p>One thing people may not realize when looking at the pointy breasts, super thin&nbsp;waistline and narrow hips of the original Barbie body&nbsp;is that the&nbsp;dimensions of the 1959 body were designed so that the doll would look like the properly brassiered and girdled figure of the well dressed woman of the 60s when she was&nbsp;fully&nbsp;dressed.&nbsp;Barbie is 1/6 the size&nbsp;of a real human being&nbsp; but the fabrics of her clothes are manufactured and woven usually for human scale clothing.&nbsp;Thus, even the finest silk taffeta on a 1/6 scale &nbsp;doll displays&nbsp;like a heavy brocade on a human woman. A waistline on a skirt often ends up as four or more layers of fabric folded &nbsp;around the waist. That amount of fabric&nbsp;bulks up that teeny tiny waistline when the doll is dressed so that she looks relatively normal for a fashion model.&nbsp;All fashion dolls are somewhat unrealistically thin, but it is&nbsp;not so much because the makers&nbsp;of dolls malignantly&nbsp;want to impose an unrealistic body image on girls to destroy their self esteem,&nbsp;but because they want the dolls to look stylishly slender once they are&nbsp;actually dressed. And dolls really can&#39;t wear bras and shapewear so their plastic figures have to be modeled as if they were.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br class="ygrps-yiv-1917052127yui-cursor"></p></div>
