<div id="ygrps-yiv-286901">A report on my 17 year old (and later my 20 year old):<br/>
<br/>
Holly and her boyfriend Brett had a romantic dinner, which they cooked  <br/>
together last night.  I was hanging out in my room in the back.  I had  <br/>
a good time.  They had a good time.  A picture of the flowers he had  <br/>
delivered to her before he got back from work are here:<br/>

<br/>
When I went in the kitchen this morning there was a homemade valentine  <br/>
from Holly to Brett, leaned up against it.  It was made with typing  <br/>
paper, construction paper hearts, and had bits glued on inside, with  <br/>
fancy art and cut-out XOXO glued onto a crayon-pattern background.   <br/>
Sounds tacky, but looked beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
Holly had written on white paper and glued over the design:<br/>
<br/>
You are a glorious friend<br/>
and an amazing human<br/>
and the love of my life.<br/>
<br/>
Nice writing.<br/>
<br/>
Granted, her life is young and he&#39;s the first love, but they do seem  <br/>
to treat each other very sweetly and well and this could be it.  Maybe  <br/>
not, but if it is, they&#39;re getting a good early start.  On the 21st it  <br/>
will have been a year since their first kiss.  She was sixteen and he  <br/>
was twenty-three.   It scared people, just the age gap and the idea of  <br/>
it.  Now she&#39;s seventeen and he&#39;s twenty-four.  Less scary.<br/>
<br/>
I never minded Kirby having older friends.  He has had since La Leche  <br/>
League days.  Later, gaming shop and karate.  It was good for him to  <br/>
have rides, before he could drive, and people who would take him to  <br/>
gaming tournaments and anime conventions.<br/>
I totally understood Marty having older friends---many of Kirby&#39;s age  <br/>
and older.<br/>
I used to joke (not really a joke) that a guy was going to have to  <br/>
pretty impressive to get Holly&#39;s attention, because she had seen her  <br/>
brothers and all her friends up close through all their pubescent  <br/>
irritating phases.<br/>
<br/>
I was still a little surprised that it was one of Kirby&#39;s friends she  <br/>
did choose to &quot;wait for.&quot;  She let him know she liked him, and when  <br/>
she was old enough for him to begin to consider, she reminded him  <br/>
again. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s *so different* from what would have happened if she were in  <br/>
school.  When she first knew him she would&#39;ve been in 9th grade and he  <br/>
was in grad school.  A year ago, she would&#39;ve been a high school  <br/>
junior and he was a grad school drop-out.  (He might go back; he might  <br/>
not.)  Knowing her as well as we do, and with her sharing all this  <br/>
with us as it slowly developed, how could we possibly think she didn&#39;t  <br/>
know what she was doing, or was being impetuous?  It was open and  <br/>
honest and aboveboard.<br/>
<br/>
They used to play Halo 3 together late at night, so they could talk,  <br/>
before there was any romance in the air but she thought he was the  <br/>
best of the guys in their extended social group.  That&#39;s quite a safe  <br/>
activity, she in her house on the XBox and he at his house.  The first  <br/>
time they were alone together, he took her to McDonald&#39;s.  Then they  <br/>
sat on the swings at a school playground, and came back before dark.<br/>
<br/>
His friends have been more critical than anyone else, but most of them  <br/>
have calmed themselves about it, especially as months have passed and  <br/>
none of their fears materialized (whatever their fears were).   I&#39;ve  <br/>
heard that his parents hate the idea of unschooling.   His dad is a  <br/>
doctor and his mom is a PhD Geneticist at the university; they&#39;ve been  <br/>
divorced since he was six.  I haven&#39;t met his dad.  His mom is really  <br/>
nice to Holly.<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t what people might have predicted, but it&#39;s very civilized  <br/>
and rarely in this century has a young man been so thoroughly vetted  <br/>
by the girl&#39;s family. &lt;bwg&gt;  Brett has been coming over here for a few  <br/>
years to hang out with Kirby, and he has come to two of my birthday  <br/>
parties (to play Encore; he sings).  I&#39;ve been at karaoke where he was  <br/>
a few times, before there was any Holly interest.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t talk about this relationship a whole lot when it was new, not  <br/>
online like this. It wasn&#39;t secret, but I was afraid it might make new  <br/>
unschoolers uncomfortable.   A year is a stable amount of time,  <br/>
though, and Holly will be 18 later this year.  Kirby was a groomsman  <br/>
in a fancy wedding at Bishop&#39;s Lodge a few years back; that wedding  <br/>
didn&#39;t last as long as this has.   So it&#39;s past being a crush or an  <br/>
aberration.   There are photos here:<br/>

<br/>
As a side note, Marty&#39;s 23-year-old girlfriend came to his 20th  <br/>
birthday party last month.    She is the younger sister of one of the  <br/>
guys who came to play games with Kirby on Wednesday nights for a  <br/>
couple of years.  She&#39;s also in the SCA, but Marty didn&#39;t know that  <br/>
when he first expressed interest.  He&#39;s known her slightly for a  <br/>
couple of years, and then she joined the SCA, but he didn&#39;t see her at  <br/>
any events.   Now they&#39;re an SCA couple (and she&#39;s in Arizona where  <br/>
Keith and Marty are, though they didn&#39;t travel together).  She can  <br/>
sew!  She was a cheerleader at Bernalillo High School.  She&#39;s a junior  <br/>
or senior in anthropology (biological stuff, genetics?) at UNM, and  <br/>
works nights in an unrelated medical lab.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-148158381">&lt;She was sixteen and he <br/>

it. Now she&#39;s seventeen and he&#39;s twenty-four. Less scary.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
And it gets less and less scary sounding as time goes by.  <br/>
<br/>
When I was a sophomore, I dated a boy who had been a friend of my older<br/>
sister&#39;s and who was a senior when I was a freshman. (so he was one year out<br/>
of school and we had worked together when we dated)  The year he got out of<br/>
high school, he moved into a house with three other young people.  They all<br/>
had jobs and were responsible in that way, but all of them partied hard on<br/>
the week-ends.  It became the place to hang out for some of us. (even after<br/>
I broke up with the boyfriend..we were still friends)  <br/>
<br/>
One of the room-mates was older (25), though he didn&#39;t look or act any<br/>
different than the rest of the group.  I expressed an interest in him before<br/>
he did me.  Then I found out he was 25.  It made no difference to me.  I<br/>
liked him.  He didn&#39;t seem any different to me than the other boys. (well,<br/>
he might have seemed a little more responsible and ready to settle down) In<br/>
time, we became a thing.  I didn&#39;t tell my parent&#39;s how old he was.  I<br/>
dodged the question.  They liked him.  They imagined he was younger than he<br/>
was.  He looked young.  He spent a lot of time at our house.  My mother fed<br/>
him well. =)  There were six kids in our family and someone was always<br/>
bringing someone home anyway.  <br/>
<br/>
When I graduated from high school we went to the same college.  After the<br/>
first year I married him thinking that my mother would kill me if I just<br/>
moved in with him.  (later on my sister did just that and she didn&#39;t get<br/>
killed so I guess I could have waited)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been 25 years since I met that bad boy who dated the younger girl.  We<br/>
have 2 great kids who are now 12 and 14.  We live together pretty easily.<br/>
He&#39;s definitely less energetic than I but that is more a personality thing<br/>
than an age thing.  It&#39;s always been that way.  <br/>
<br/>
It still freaks me out on some level when I hear of someone dating someone<br/>
with a huge age difference because our culture flinches at that.  I always<br/>
have to stop and reflect about it and not just react and then I&#39;m always<br/>
okay with it.  I have never felt like I was a different age than my hubby<br/>
except when we compare the cultures of our childhood&#39;s.  He&#39;s a seventies<br/>
boy and I&#39;m and eighties girl.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1139589148">I enjoyed reading about Holly and her boyfriend (and other family  <br/>
tidbits thrown in :P  )<br/>
I vaguely recall when things were beginning for them. I think you  <br/>
posted a processing sort of post. It was beautiful to read your  <br/>
authentic process.<br/>
<br/>
What is even more beautiful is that you processed this &quot;event&quot; or  <br/>
happening, just as you probably did with all life events your kids  <br/>
went through... with partnership, connection, support, communication,  <br/>
and lots of Trust.  How amazing that these foundations of unschooling  <br/>
can really make life&#39;s changes, challenges, shifts..... into something  <br/>
beautiful that can just be called Life.<br/>
<br/>
How wonderful for Holly to have a mother who supports her. How  <br/>
wonderful for you to have a daughter who is connected to you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1901082073">I was nineteen and my hubby 30 when we met and were married less than a year later.  We have been married 29 years....I don&#39;t think our ages had anything to do with our willingness to love and committment, learn and grow together....<br/>
<br/>
Another good friend was in late 20&#39;s when he feel in love with a young teen from the youth group.  He waited, got to know the family, never said anything, until see was later teens. They were married when she was about 18 and it has been years and years that they have been married.<br/>
<br/>
Without societal &quot;rules&quot; and projection of our fears onto our children,  they are free to find their way, with parental &quot;wisdom&quot; as a reference, as needed or desired, and inturn learn to listen to their own hearts and their own wisdom.<br/>

I admire your &quot;walk&quot; with your daughter,  Sandra!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Chamille was hanging out with an older boy for a while.  He&#39;s 20 and<br/>
Chamille is 14.  Nothing ever came of it.  It did seem scary and weird<br/>
at first, but I got to know the boy and he&#39;s a very very nice person and<br/>
he has a lot in common with Chamille.  He came over to our house a lot<br/>
just to hang out and sometimes they&#39;d go get pizza or hang out at the<br/>
mall, with or without others along.<br/>
<br/>
We haven&#39;t seen much of him lately because he got a second job to save<br/>
money to move out of his parent&#39;s house.  At first the age difference<br/>
seemed huge, but Chamille is pretty mature and a 20 boy can still be a<br/>
boy in many ways.<br/>
<br/>
It was the same thing here, I didn&#39;t talk about it much because so many<br/>
people find it just plain wrong.  In actuality, I think the teen crowd<br/>
and young adult crowd seem to mix a lot.  Lots of people have siblings,<br/>
and siblings have friends, it seems natural that various ages of people<br/>
would be attracted to one another.  The 20 yr olds that I&#39;ve met still<br/>
seem much like kids to me, even the mature ones!<br/>
<br/>
It didn&#39;t surprise me really, Chamille doesn&#39;t do anything the &quot;normal&quot;<br/>
way, and a friend is a friend, no matter what age or gender.  If it had<br/>
become something more than that, I was prepared to consider it.  There<br/>
would&#39;ve been more at risk for him because of the way OR laws are, no<br/>
laws against dating, just anything remotely sexual, and kissing counts. <br/>
I did talk to Chamille about that because it&#39;s always good to know what<br/>
you are getting into, the reality of what is and isn&#39;t allowed by law<br/>
and how it could impact one&#39;s life.</div>

<br/>
<br/>
I checked the laws, because when Holly was first interested in Brett,  <br/>
I wanted to see whether it was even a possibility, legally and  <br/>
socially.  I have a friend who&#39;s an assistant district attorney, and  <br/>
when I found what I could find, I showed it to him and asked him to  <br/>
explain it.  He said it&#39;s ambiguous about the before or after 16 but  <br/>
that the instructions to the jury are written so that it&#39;s  <br/>
interpretted as a person of 16 being old enough to make decisions.    <br/>
I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s an advantage to leave the law as it is because it  <br/>
discourages people, but had I read it one way instead of the other, or  <br/>
not had anyone to ask, I would&#39;ve been very worried that he could get  <br/>
in trouble for her being sixteen.<br/>
<br/>
What my friend did explain to me was that if she went to a school  <br/>
where he was employed, or was in a medical treatment facility where he  <br/>
worked, that would be illegal.<br/>
<br/>
Different states are different ways, and there are situations in which  <br/>
parental permission can&#39;t save the older person if people outside the  <br/>
situation want to make a deal about it.<br/>
