<div id="ygrps-yiv-1325476158">Hi all.  I am new to this list, but some of you may<br/>
remember me from the Unschooling list, where I was<br/>
from it&#39;s inception.  I have long ago put that list on<br/>
no mail for various reasons, and a friend recommended<br/>
I try Sandra&#39;s new list, so here I am.<br/>
<br/>
I was intrigued by these questions of Nancy&#39;s,<br/>
although my intent was to read through all this<br/>
backlog of email that has built up from ISP problems<br/>
last month preventing my from accessng my email all<br/>
month.  Ah well, I know better than to give myself<br/>
expectations (that dirty E word.)  <br/>
<br/>
Just remember that all these views are Mine, and so I<br/>
claim the right to be as Kooky as I wanna be.  In<br/>
other words, don&#39;t confuse strong opinions with facts.<br/>
 What may be facts for me are simply facts for me, not<br/>
necessarily anyone else&#39;s reality.  Things are so<br/>
subjective in the spiritual aspects of our lives.  How<br/>
wonderfully varied and rich a taperstry we weave. <br/>
Like Ken Wilber&#39;s Specturm of Consciousness<br/>
philosophy, where all concious and unconscious thought<br/>
and secular and spiritual beliefs are all part of the<br/>
same rich continuum, and all have merit and value<br/>
without conflicting because they address differing<br/>
layers and facets of the spectrum.  Blue is no less<br/>
deep, satisfying and rich a color because Red is<br/>
vibrant and alive.  They exist together yet apart,<br/>
important and vital for their own qualities.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I have a deep topic knocking at the inside of my<br/>
&gt;skull, trying to find its way out....  <br/>
&gt;- Does faith depend on heredity?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would hardly think that is true from the evidence of<br/>
mine and my husband&#39;s families.  But that is not to<br/>
say that it is not possible.  ANYTHING is possible, in<br/>
my opinion.  My brother is athiest, my parents long<br/>
ago dissillusioned with churches and belongling to<br/>
none, but maintaining some vague, unspoken Lutheran<br/>
affiliation.  My father&#39;s sisters are quite devout<br/>
Protestants.<br/>
<br/>
My husband&#39;s family are all passionate about their<br/>
spiritual/religious path (men and women) but they have<br/>
wildly differing paths.  We all respect each others<br/>
paths and share holidays with each other accordingly. <br/>
His parents are devout Protestant as is his elder<br/>
sister.  His younger sister is staunchly Jehovah<br/>
Witness.  My husband and I are passionately eclectic<br/>
Pagan.  We all have strong values and beliefs and<br/>
strength and commitment in our faith.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Is there a brain structure or function which &gt;governs<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;God&quot;?  <br/>
<br/>
Surely, as there is a brain structure which handles<br/>
ALL the varying parts of our complex selves.  I do not<br/>
believe that this area of the brain &quot;creates&quot; our<br/>
Higher Power for us, but perhaps helps determine in<br/>
what ways we speak with and relate to that Higher<br/>
Power.  How and where we find our faith is always very<br/>
individualized and personal, even between members of<br/>
strict sects.  No one has the exact same relationship<br/>
with the spirit or with their Higher Power.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If a person who is religious can become an atheist<br/>
&gt;because of depression, does it mean that faith, or<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the &gt;perception of God, or spirituality, is controlled<br/>
by &gt;some function of the brain, which depression<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;interrupts?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I suppose that is possible.  Although I can say from<br/>
personal experience that I have suffered from<br/>
depression in varying degrees all my life.  My<br/>
depression was worst as a child, beginning in infancy<br/>
and continuing into adulthood.  During my childhood,<br/>
in my questing, I was always a very spiritual person<br/>
and immersed myself in the faiths and beliefs around<br/>
me.  Luckily I grew up in San Francisco and had many<br/>
to choose from.  I eventually found my spiritual home<br/>
in the neo-Pagan movement when I was in my early teens<br/>
and have ever found my faith to be a support for me in<br/>
my times of stress and depression.  I experienced deep<br/>
epiphanies of faith while in black suicidal<br/>
depressions.  Connections with the weave of existance<br/>
and my Higher Power often kept me alive in my<br/>
childhood, coming seemingly miraculously when I was at<br/>
my most self hating and apathetic, like a sweeping<br/>
wave of passionate energy that swept me up and<br/>
sustained me.  And no, they weren&#39;t drug induced.  LOL<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have worshipped with many covens, groves, and<br/>
groups, but have never &quot;belonged&quot; to any church or<br/>
ideology.  I do not believe in organized religion<br/>
because I believe that the journey of the spirit is<br/>
very intimate and personalized.  I would no more<br/>
expect my children or my husband&#39;s journeys through<br/>
their lives to find spiritual fulfillment to echo my<br/>
own, than I would follow my parent&#39;s apathetic path. <br/>
God/Goddess/Higher Power is a Mirror,(as the saying<br/>
goes.) Although the mirror never changes, each person<br/>
who gazes into it sees a different face.  Your Higher<br/>
Power speaks to your soul in the most appropriate way<br/>
for you at any given time in your lifetime, or<br/>
soultime.  This may include times (or whole lifetimes<br/>
for those of us who believe in reincarnation) where<br/>
the soul is cut free from belief in Higher Power and<br/>
set adrift to quest and learn lessons necessary for<br/>
the soul at that time.  All knowledge of the soul and<br/>
the spirit is good knowledge, regardless of<br/>
ideologies, dogmas and faith systems.  Deep and<br/>
intimate knowledge of the self is good too, regardless<br/>
of where it is found.<br/>
<br/>
That is not to say there is no enrichment or merit to<br/>
be found in group worship, so long as individuals are<br/>
resepected and allowed to guide their own personal<br/>
ideologies, simply that dogma is restrictive to the<br/>
growth of the soul.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Do closed societies(the Amish, for instance) maintain<br/>
&gt;their religion because the propensity to it is<br/>
&gt;inherited?  Is there a &quot;God gene&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One of the joys of life is the endless possibilities. <br/>
Anything is possible.  But then, you also have folks<br/>
marrying into the Amish culture in a small but<br/>
consistent number, who come from varying secular and<br/>
religious traditions.  More telling I think, might be<br/>
a genetic predisposition for certain personality types<br/>
which find fullfillment in the Amish way of life.  But<br/>
this may amount to the same thing, depending upon what<br/>
you devine to be the source of religious and spiritual<br/>
inspiration in the mind.  The children of the Amish<br/>
are always free to leave to culture, but seldom do. <br/>
This could not be only attributed to the fact that it<br/>
is all they know, as human beings are endlessly<br/>
curious and flexible and constantly seeking newness. <br/>
More like this is what they want, knowing what options<br/>
they have.  They are predisposed to the life by<br/>
genetics in personality.  (Just an idea.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If the answer to any of that is &quot;yes,&quot; does it mean<br/>
&gt;that God does not exist, that our perceptions are<br/>
&gt;delusions which plague some but not others, or <br/>
&gt;does it mean he/she/it *does* exist, and has created<br/>
&gt;these structures or functions in order to have<br/>
&gt;contact with us?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What a wonderful question to let your spirit ponder<br/>
on.  This type of questing is most undoubtedly good<br/>
for the soul.  Doubting your faith means that you are<br/>
alive and awake and vibrant, not that you are<br/>
unworthy.  Questioning and being reaffirmed in your<br/>
path or in another path are all part of learning<br/>
knowledge of the self and the soul and the universe.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;And does it mean that those without &gt;the capacity to<br/>
&gt;perceive him are damned?  Or, if he &gt;is just, that<br/>
&gt;those without the gene are equally &gt;saved without<br/>
&gt;religion, since it would be unfair &gt;otherwise?  (I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;using saved and damned in a general &gt;sense, as most<br/>
&gt;religions promise some kind of reward for<br/>
&gt;participation.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mine does not.  That is to say.  I do not believe in<br/>
sin, nor do any pagans that I know of have any concept<br/>
of sin, retribution, punishment or reward in their<br/>
faith system.  There is simply energy in the world<br/>
that can be directed towards good or ill intent. <br/>
These energies create their own backlash of like to<br/>
like.  So ill actions get you ill returns and positive<br/>
forces have positive affects on the practitioner.  So<br/>
this self regulates each practitioner to know<br/>
logically that if they crave good things for<br/>
themselves, they must do good things for others and be<br/>
of good heart, sending out these positive energies<br/>
into the world.<br/>
<br/>
God/Goddess as personified for me as a<br/>
dual/multifaceted Higher Power is our Mother and our<br/>
Father, much as the Catholic trinity is a trifaceted<br/>
Higher Power.  As Mother/Father, God/Goddess gives us<br/>
life and guides us through transitions before and<br/>
after life.  God/Goddess creates all things and is all<br/>
things, the same way matter and energy are a part of<br/>
all things, for these are the embodiment of<br/>
God/Goddes.  No matter the names, mythos, rituals or<br/>
traditions, for it is all speaking to the same Higher<br/>
Power, who loves us all.  These things are tools for<br/>
our minds to understand concepts beyond them, as well<br/>
as they are true and real histories and happenings as<br/>
much as any knowledge of the spirit.  We create<br/>
reality by our belief, and God/Goddess sees this and<br/>
is proud of our ability, like Him/Her, to create.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;And what of religions that practice meditation, or<br/>
&gt;use drugs sacramentally?  My religion&#39;s hagiography<br/>
&gt;is replete with saints whose visions could be just as<br/>
&gt;easily described as hallucinations; were they just<br/>
&gt;nuts, or can severe fasting account for them?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nancy<br/>
<br/>
And many cultures believe that dreams and visions are<br/>
just as real and touchable as our physical reality,<br/>
and in some cases much more vital and important.  Are<br/>
we so wise to say this is not so?  I never comfort my<br/>
children after a nightmare by calling it &quot;Only a<br/>
dream&quot;, for their dreams are real and important in<br/>
their own right and part of the real world of the<br/>
spirit.  Rather I encourage them to talk about them,<br/>
think about them and be empowered to take control of<br/>
them for good.  My elder son&#39;s chronic nightmares were<br/>
vaquished by a sword of light he learned to wield<br/>
against the monsters of his unconscious mind, and<br/>
embodied by a toy sword he took to bed with him<br/>
faithfully for several years.  <br/>
<br/>
Who am I to say that this was pure psychology?  We all<br/>
know that the mind and the will can be greater than<br/>
the body, can will the body to live or to die beyond<br/>
our physical reason or reality should allow.  We know<br/>
that other states of consciousness can so affect the<br/>
body as to allow endurance of pain, miraculous healing<br/>
and other affects.  Who are we to say that even those<br/>
explained to the genetic and chemical level as<br/>
miracles of &quot;science&quot; are not still embodiments of the<br/>
soul/spirit and Higher Power at work?  I do not claim<br/>
to be so wise as to say that anything is NOT Possible,<br/>
or that I know more than a tiny bit about anything. <br/>
Of course, I am still always learning.  ;-)<br/>
