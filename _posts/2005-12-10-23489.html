&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ok this is just a question not about a spacific family (that I can<br/>
&gt; think of right now): Now is unschooling what you (as members of this<br/>
&gt; group) think of as the ideal situation and the best way for most<br/>
&gt; people to homeschool or is it just for people who are life-long<br/>
&gt; learners themselves and are well read or well educated on the<br/>
&gt; unschooling subject.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

I don&#39;t think you have to be well read or well educated on unschooling to<br/>
unschool. Some people jump in a pool and just swim, they didn&#39;t need lessons<br/>
in particular, and their way of getting to the other end of the pool is just<br/>
fine, even if it doesn&#39;t look like my way. If they&#39;re not drowning, they&#39;re<br/>
swimming. :)<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling in my family is partly how we are with each other and would<br/>
(hopefully) still be with each other if our girls were in school: calm,<br/>
respectful, encouraging. It is partly what we actually do for and with the<br/>
girls: helping to find resources as needed or requested, keeping an eye out<br/>
for things the other people in the family might find exciting or useful,<br/>
coming to each others aid when its needed, even when not specifically asked.<br/>
<br/>
Now that my daughters are growing up, they are almost as likely to find<br/>
things that are of use to me as Wally or I are to find things that are of<br/>
use to them. I am hopeless with most of the electronic gadgets in the house.<br/>
My eleven year old cheerfully sets up DVR recordings for me, shows me<br/>
patiently (for the 10th time) how do do certain things on the computer, etc.<br/>
What has gone around here, has come around. :)<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about and should be about choices. A family who is Christian<br/>
and tells their children they cannot associate with the heathens down the<br/>
block is denying choices as surely as an unschooling family who tells their<br/>
children that they may not, under any circumstances, attend a school.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what third world countries have to do with it. :) If a mother<br/>
or father or child who is from a third world country makes it into my<br/>
general orbit and wants to ask me unschooling questions, I&#39;d be happy to<br/>
answer them to the best of my ability. Otherwise, it just seems a de-railing<br/>
sort of side topic.<br/>
