<div id="ygrps-yiv-642142497">There was a thread here that inspired me to write this blog entry. Times are tough financially for lots of people right now. Our family included and the fact that we unschool has actually helped us stay connected and inspired through the rough stuff. I hope this inspires some other folks as well...<br/>

The entry is called, Creating Love in These Hard Times<br/>
<br/>
Here are some snippets:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The kids have been living with less than they are used to materially for the last year and a half. However they are living with MORE than they are used to freedom wise over the last year and a half. Because we&#39;ve shifted to whole life unschooling. Our kids are free to make choices for themselves. They can choose when to get up, when to go to bed, when to read a book, when to build something, when to create, when to use play video games, when to play outside and so much more.<br/>
<br/>
Some people might look at us and see neglectful parents, parents with kids that don&#39;t have a lot of rules and don&#39;t even have electricity.but those people would be so far from reality. Jeff and I have *never* been more attentive to the needs of our children than we have been this past year. We talk with them constantly about what their individual interests and goals are. We are WITH them nearly all the time. We bring them on adventures. We introduce them to more families and children who may or may not live how we do. We talk with them but more importantly we listen to them. We answer questions. We discuss. We find resources for their interests. Which include music, building, friends, technology, welding, boating, animals.and more of course.there is always more.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2009484405">I am so appreciative of everyone who took the time to write.  (I am not going to write on this anymore because I am pretty sure I &#39;get it&#39; from what was written.)<br/>
It really helped to hear stories of others who are living and learning through financial meltdown.  Life has become so sweet for our family since becoming part of this list. Sometimes I get suck because the old baggage comes up and takes hold of my thoughts and then I check in and it melts away again.  You have all made a difference in my life and the lives of my family. <br/>
