<div id="ygrps-yiv-1325521981">Literarily speaking, what&#39;s the difference?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  This year the Library&#39;s program ties in with Harry <br/>
<br/>
Potter and since we don&#39;t do that type of material, we backed out.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;an armful of Dr. Seuss books . . . ALL home to read. . .pushed herself day <br/>
and night to <br/>
<br/>
read them all. . . &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s the difference between Harry Potter books and Dr. Seuss books?<br/>
Both are fantasy.  The better Dr. Seuss books deal with morality and <br/>
interpersonal relationships.<br/>

<br/>
That would&#39;ve been my guess.<br/>
 <br/>
As unschooling continues to unfold, please consider the potential problems  <br/>
of &quot;we&quot; when written by the mom about the set of mom-and-children.  How did  <br/>
&quot;we&quot; (your we) decide what you (as a collective group) liked?  If  you-the-mom <br/>
made the unilateral decision, it will probably help your writing and  your <br/>
children&#39;s development if you say &quot;I&quot; when you mean &quot;I.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
It will be somewhere between hard and impossible for your children to know  <br/>
what their interests and preferences are if they feel part of a borg-like &quot;we,&quot; <br/>
 when it comes to what&#39;s liked.<br/>

the person obviously really just means themselves.  But Borg-like is <br/>
better, because they generally want others to think the &quot;we&quot;  <br/>

about the decisions they are making for others, not just using a <br/>

appropriate.  Are fairy tales only ok if the witch is evil and gets <br/>
burned up or some such, as in Hansel and Gretel, or are all fairy <br/>
tales not acceptable?  Joan of Arc was burned as a witch, how about <br/>
her story?  The wizard of Oz has a Good Witch of the North in it, is <br/>
that off limits too?<br/>

But Dorothy&#39;s aunt is a good Christian woman (says so herself, in the movie  <br/>

didn&#39;t seem Jewish; no other choices in those days. &lt;g&gt;)  The  scarecrow?  <br/>
Humanist, probably (philosophically), but I don&#39;t know.   The Lion?  French?  <br/>

SEXShuel, therefor not  Christian.  <br/>
 <br/>
Toto?  No soul.  <br/>
 <br/>
All those based on 1939 (38?) movie version, and all TRUE (within my  <br/>
literary and artistic interpretation of the moment, strained through the  sieve of my <br/>
knowledge of history, geography, and theology), guaranteed to make  some <br/>
laugh, and to irritate all.  Step right up!  See the most  Irritating Post of the <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>True, but the stygian witches came from Greek mythology.  I wonder if <br/>
mythology in general is off limits.  Mythology really just means <br/>
historical religious/cultural beliefs that are not your own.<br/>
<br/>
What about animated Disney movies, which are rife with good and evil <br/>
magic doers, magical creatures, fantasy and mythological stories?<br/>
<br/>
Dr. Seuss has been known to include quite a few magical folks and <br/>
creatures in his books as well, (the Lorax, the Whos, Horton&#39;s <br/>
elephant bird, and so on) but those seem to be acceptable, or at least <br/>
his books as a class.  <br/>
<br/>
Censorship just seems like a lot of work to me.  What method is used <br/>
to determine fitness of materials?  Do you have to read/view <br/>
everything before you pass judgement, or rely on others to screen it <br/>
for you?<br/>

Reading thing.  Harry Potter Pajama party.  From 9pm to 1am on a <br/>
Friday night they will be screening Prisoner of Azkaban and then <br/>
reading aloud chapter 1 of Half Blood Prince.  My only worry is that <br/>
it will be too crowded for my kids, which is likely, but we can always <br/>
go and then leave if it is too crowded.  We have Azkaban at home and <br/>
we could order the book and do our own pajama party if it doesn&#39;t work <br/>
out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1584893563">Hey! Dh and I just did a stage version of Wizard of Oz with kids. Only we<br/>
made the wizard a girl who was dressing as a guy because she loved magic and<br/>
couldn&#39;t make it in the traveling circus show as a girl. Then Oz scooped him<br/>
(her) up as their wizard and it wasn&#39;t until Toto pulled her out of the<br/>
curtain that anyone knew. She sings a beautiful song written by my dh and a<br/>
teenage musician that explains her story. Just thought I&#39;d share.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and we kept Aunt Em as the Christian woman...it gave the audience a<br/>
little chuckle. When Dorothy talks about staring in the creek, here&#39;s the<br/>
dialogue:<br/>
<br/>
Aunt Em: ...there ain&#39;t nothin&#39; to see in a crick - on&#39;y stones an&#39; fish<br/>
swimmin&#39; around.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Dorothy: &quot;Is that all you see in a crick, Aunt Em?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Aunt Em:&quot;It&#39;s all any Christian can see, Dor&#39;thy&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Dorothy: Didn&#39;t you ever look quick at a fish an&#39; think first off it was a<br/>
mermaid maybe?...I have lotsa times.<br/>
<br/>
Aunt Em: That ain&#39;t right, Dorothy...If the good Lord had wanted us to see<br/>
mermaids swimmin&#39; through our cow pasture, he&#39;d o&#39; put &#39;em there Himself!<br/>
<br/>
So there you go.<br/>

Oh, the lion had dreadlocks for his mane btw, making him more Jamaican<br/>

looked ho mo SEXShuel, since she was so caring toward Dorothy.<br/>

The kids and I go to the local UU church and I&#39;m very involved in <br/>
Programming and in Religious Ed for kids (so far the MS and HS levels).  <br/>
A wonderful homeschooling family invited Hannah & Hayden to go to their <br/>
AWANA program on Wednesday nights... It scares me on several levels and <br/>
my kids are really puzzled (by my inability to articulate exactly what <br/>
my issue is).  They see AWANA as a fun time to hang out with their <br/>
friends, I see it as a brainwashing technique.  I have a lot of input <br/>
into our own children&#39;s programming and the Director is my next-door <br/>
neighbor; we&#39;ve brainstormed ideas to compete, thus far to no avail.  I <br/>
know Jesus isn&#39;t the reason my kids are going... it&#39;s the stop at <br/>
McDonalds before class, having 2 extra hours with their good friends, <br/>
gold stickers and AWANA bucks.  I don&#39;t know how to compete, or even if <br/>
I should... at this point, I&#39;ve decided to support them in this, even <br/>
though my heart&#39;s not quite in it.  I take them to a church where <br/>
&quot;whatever you *need* to believe to be you, in your life, is just fine&quot; <br/>
it&#39;s a struggle to hear them talk about *sin* and *salvation* when I&#39;ve <br/>
worked so hard to keep that nonsense out of their minds and hearts...<br/>
Anyone else?? <br/>

It  wasn&#39;t meant to be personal <br/>
about anyone on this list. You believe  differently and I respect <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t taken personally.  None of us is Harry Potter. <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m sorry if you took it personally.  It wasn&#39;t bashing, it was  <br/>
philosophical discussion of the value of choice and freedom.<br/>
 <br/>
It was philosophical discussion of how unschooling works well.  If  your <br/>
unschooling involves your personal choices limiting your children&#39;s  personal <br/>
choices (or creating them, as when you say &quot;we&quot;), there can be problems  with <br/>
that, as unschooling and autonomy go.<br/>
 <br/>
If autonomy isn&#39;t among a family&#39;s goals, that&#39;s a philosophical point  worth <br/>
examining and worth discussing here, in a general non-personal way.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Julie,<br/>
<br/>
I think what you&#39;ll find on this list is a radical unschooling take on<br/>
ideas, not people. I don&#39;t know you, but because you are a person on this<br/>
earth I respect you. However, I have no intention of respecting *ideas* that<br/>
*I* think are not good for children. It has nothing to do with you. When you<br/>
say something like &quot;we don&#39;t like witches and such&quot; or whatever the lead in<br/>
thought was, it sparked a conversation about censoring and control. That<br/>
happens to also be part of your religion too, I&#39;m guessing. Those ideas are<br/>
ones we work with often on this list and every other unschooling list I&#39;ve<br/>
seen. We are all to some degree consciously letting go of over control and<br/>
over censoring so that our children can breathe and be the intelligent and<br/>
bright people that they are. This doesn&#39;t mean that they can throw rocks<br/>
through windows and call people nasty names (unless of course its deserved<br/>
;-), but it does mean trusting that they will make good choices (and they<br/>
do) given all the information available, maybe even info about witches and<br/>
sorcery.<br/>
<br/>
We are all on our different journeys through life, and are where we are<br/>
today because that is where the journey has lead us. And the journeys<br/>
continue. So I hope that this list helps in sharing more information about<br/>
trusting our children, respecting their abilities to make good decisions,<br/>
and how to be the best parents that we can be in that process.<br/>
<br/>
I have many Christian friends, good friends, in fact my husband&#39;s best<br/>
friend just left here after spending a week with us. He&#39;s an evangelical<br/>
Christian. I say the same things to him that I have said on this list about<br/>
the *ideas* of his religion. I love *him* though. He may be an oddity though<br/>
because he is the only Christian friend that I can truly say what I think<br/>
and he doesn&#39;t drop us. Of course he&#39;s also open with the fact that he will<br/>
always continue to try to save us.<br/>
<br/>
I do not mean to offend you in any way Julie. I just wanted to share that I<br/>
don&#39;t think *you* are being disrespected, but ideas that discourage radical<br/>
unschooling will be disrespected on this list. The intent is to present<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
Jacki<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1034740600">My first post here also.  But I had to respond.  My dh and I have struggled <br/>
with the issue of faith a long time...the UU view best fits what I feel.  My <br/>
dh feels like religion is purely a psychological manifestation to &quot;make <br/>
sense&quot; of life.  Either way, there isn&#39;t a lot of reassurance we can give <br/>
themabout issues like, &quot;what happens when you die?&quot;  Anyway, blah, blah <br/>
background.  My in-laws live on a lake where they have boat church at the <br/>
bottom of the hill from their house (and where we stay during the summer).  <br/>
There is a service at 8am and then everyone has food and it is fellowship <br/>
time.  It&#39;s &quot;non-denominational&quot; but it&#39;s christian (I always get a kick out <br/>
of that).  Anyway, I have always thought I would expose my dc to all <br/>
religious beliefs and what I believe but let them choose.  I have become <br/>
increasingly uncomfortable with their attendance lately and we talk about <br/>
what it means (but they&#39;re 4 and 6) so, I don&#39;t know how much they take at <br/>
face value.  My dd has begun talking about because Jesus...etc...The thing <br/>
that kills me is my inlaws don&#39;t REALLY believe.  It is that it is <br/>
comfortable.  It is an easy way to teach morals etc...but the bad part is it <br/>
has become a strenuous and uncomfortable undercurrent at the beginning of <br/>
every weekend to avoid them attending.  Any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
SO that was a whole lot of info that was of no help to you whatsoever, other <br/>
then maybe, &quot;hey look!  you&#39;re not alone!&quot;<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think so.  Hollyhock grows on a tall stem and the leaves are  kinda <br/>
rough and dry, a little like sandpapery geraniums.  The first year  they hardly <br/>
do anything.  They&#39;re dinky little plants. The second and third  years <br/>
they&#39;re big and bloom, and the older plants that&#39;ve been there a long time  must <br/>
have mondo deep roots because once they&#39;re established they don&#39;t need  water <br/>
(they don&#39;t mind it, but they don&#39;t seem to die without it), so they were  until <br/>
lately old-lady flowers in the southwest.   Lately they&#39;re  having a <br/>
resurgence.  In some yards all that&#39;s needed is for people not to  mow where the <br/>
hollyhocks used to be. &lt;g&gt;  I planted mine, though,  from seed we snagged from other <br/>
plants.  I spotted a really dark wine  colored one today, almost black <br/>
looking and if I can remember which plant it was  when winter comes, I can get <br/>
enough seeds from the pod of just one flower to  plant a whole bunch.  They make <br/>
LOTS of seeds, just don&#39;t come up so easily  sometimes.  <br/>
 <br/>
I looked up hibiscus with google image and they look really  cool!!<br/>
