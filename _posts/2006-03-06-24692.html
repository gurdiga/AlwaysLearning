<div id="ygrps-yiv-837853011">Hi all.<br/>
<br/>
My dd has an event at Mohegan Sun in Ct this Sunday, Mar 12th and we need to be there by 8am.  Living in NY this is more than a two 1/2 hour drive for us.  Is there anyone who lives in the vicinity that is willing to put up 3 unschoolers for the evening of Mar 11th.  My 2 dd&#39;s (7.5 & 12.5 yos) and myself.  Or could recommend cheap hotel somewhere near Mohegan Sun.<br/>
<br/>
email me off list.<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
Lisa Heyman<br/>
