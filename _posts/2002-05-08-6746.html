<br/>
My guess would be that you are much less &quot;dull&quot; than you think you are.  If<br/>
you feel that you are just plodding through your life and the kids are bored<br/>
and not being exposed to their world, go ahead and schedule the<br/>
activities.....just don&#39;t schedule them for the kids, schedule them for you.<br/>
Do interesting things FOR YOU, that YOU like.  Of course, ask the kids if<br/>
they want to play or come with you....but do it FOR YOU.<br/>
<br/>
If your house is anything like my house, you can&#39;t do anything solo<br/>
anyway....somebody is always asking to help, to find out what you are doing<br/>
and why, etc..<br/>
<br/>
I truly believe that to &quot;get&quot; unschooling for your kids, you first have to<br/>
&quot;get&quot; it for you.  What have you always wanted to do but never had the time<br/>
or the money or whatever?  Organic gardening?  flying lessons?  karate?<br/>
volunteer as a fireman?  have your own dairy?  holistic medicine?  Those are<br/>
topics that my kids know a great deal about because they are interests of<br/>
mine and my dh.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you want to make homemade soap, learn to sew, learn to weld, write a<br/>
book, do calligraphy, paint, whatever.  Schedule YOU some time and do it.<br/>
Once you quit worrying so much about what the kids are learning and start<br/>
learning yourself.......you will be amazed.<br/>
