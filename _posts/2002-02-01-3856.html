  &gt; HAH, Naked chef is *ok* but IRON CHEF rules all..<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; We are fully addicted to that show, every once of us races to the tv when <br/>
  &gt; it&#39;s one so we can guess what &#39;new&#39; ingredient will be unveiled and how the <br/>
  &gt; chefs will prepare them..Then we try and fathom what they taste like (and <br/>
  &gt; we end up with some gagging noises sometimes!!)..Matter of fact this has <br/>
  &gt; sparked our newest &#39;idea&#39;..Once every other month we are going to <br/>
  &gt; experiment with different types of foods, I think Japanese will be our <br/>
  &gt; first since it&#39;s our &#39;inspiration&#39;..we&#39;re still working out the details but <br/>
  &gt; we will either be attempting to cook a traditional meal or finding a <br/>
  &gt; restaurant and experiencing a traditional meal :grin:..<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  Iron Chef is a blast!<br/>
<br/>
  Since we bought the house I watch a LOT of HGTV. I like the decorating shows <br/>
  that are funky, like the one where two families decorate each other&#39;s houses.<br/>

  I saw that one too! I was channel surfing and happened to come across the show for the first time. The one where they painted the whole room dark brown? I thought it was a drastic change but I was wondering if the lady was acting when she ran out the room crying. It seemed a bit too much. I would have at least pretended to like it, being on TV and all. ;-)<br/>
