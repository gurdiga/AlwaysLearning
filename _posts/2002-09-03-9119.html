&lt;&lt; I still remember finally *getting* what the pledge was about, and then <br/>
 refusing to say it anymore.  Liberty and justice for all in <br/>
 1962?  Sure!  Then there was the under God part.  Not me.<br/>

I just learned where that damned pledge came from (a socialist that pushed to <br/>
get it into schools in the late 1800&#39;s) and that the &quot;under God&quot; part was <br/>
added in the 50&#39;s by a very fundamentalist Christian group. <br/>
Dh and I went to a music in the park thing that is very popular here and they <br/>
did the pledge in opening the concert. I couldn&#39;t say it, but I did stand up <br/>
respectfully with my hand over my heart. I felt like a hypocrite even doing <br/>
that, but didn&#39;t want to start a debate with our friends.<br/>

scout information meeting the other night, the color guard came out with the <br/>
flag and they asked the parents to stand and join in the pledge. I stood, put <br/>
my hand over my heart, and the words just wouldn&#39;t come out, so I mouthed <br/>
along. Darin leaned over after and asked if I had said the pledge. &quot;Of course <br/>
honey. Didn&#39;t you hear me?&quot; And then, on Sunday, at our family reunion, I was <br/>
laughing with Jack half way through the prayer before we ate. Poor Grandma, I <br/>
just didn&#39;t realize the prayer was being said. <br/>
~Nancy~ Who is having a hard time reconciling these new ideas with her <br/>
patriotism and being a Republican. Not to say that Democrats are unpatriotic, <br/>
and not to say I am ready to shed my GOP affiliation just yet either. &lt;veg&gt;<br/>

another Nancy, whose dh just jumped the GOP ship to the libertarian<br/>
lifeboat.<br/>
