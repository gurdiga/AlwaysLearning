<div id="ygrps-yiv-1701231705">I really didn&#39;t mean it when I said &quot;why try&quot; in response to the other e-mail <br/>
group.<br/>
It was my mood at the moment. I was drained.<br/>
You hit spots where you just think there is no point in doing the same dance <br/>
again, who will benefit? Then I walk away from the computer, or get out of <br/>
the house and think of some really good point and want to post again.<br/>
So I&#39;m back to posting there, just limited.<br/>
<br/>
And for the record, your style is wonderful Joyce! Very clear and useful.<br/>
So many people are better writers than I. Maybe that&#39;s why I want to give up <br/>
sometimes and leave the posting to those more talented individuals.<br/>
But I do enjoy the mind stimulation of conversation, so it keeps me coming <br/>
back!<br/>

Kelly,<br/>
My kids told someone I work with &quot;we teach ourselves&quot; and I got a pretty <br/>
strange look and some comment like &quot;That&#39;s not good&quot;.<br/>
Oh the things people say without much thought!<br/>
My sis instant messaged me last night and told me to get offline because she <br/>
wanted to call. I told her I&#39;d finish up at my message board and get off. She <br/>
made a comment about &quot;I have more creative ways to spend my time than on some <br/>
message boards&quot; .<br/>
When I replied &quot;Thinking isn&#39;t creative? Since when?&quot;  I didn&#39;t get an <br/>
answer!! LOL<br/>
I do love her, but sometimes I hear the words of my Mom or Grandma coming <br/>
through, without any thought as to whether it makes any sense.<br/>
<br/>
There is such a lack of thought, of questioning and seeking these days.<br/>

ever read a post of Joyce&#39;s that I haven&#39;t liked or that hasn&#39;t helped in <br/>
some way. For the record.<br/>
<br/>
Now about that record...will this be going on Joyce&#39;s &quot;permanent record.&quot; <br/>
:-O<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-484475978">Thank you Ren :-) If I&#39;m clear it&#39;s not because I was born a good writer but<br/>
because I&#39;m motivated to be clear! I don&#39;t like arguing over what someone<br/>
thought I meant and I don&#39;t like having errors pointed out ;-) So feedback<br/>
has motivated me to learn to hear how what I write could sound to someone<br/>
else.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; There is such a lack of thought, of questioning and seeking these days.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s ever been different. It&#39;s that over a life time we&#39;re<br/>
going to meet a whole lot more unthinking people than people of the past did<br/>
just because there are more people. And, to some extent, in the past people<br/>
could stick to rules because the present wasn&#39;t much different from the past<br/>
when the rules were made up so not thinking wasn&#39;t that great of a deal. In<br/>
fact it was probably better to do as you learned rather than think too hard<br/>
about it. What was there to question or seek? You attended the church<br/>
everyone did, entered the profession your father had, married the person<br/>
your parents thought best. Not only wasn&#39;t there much to think about, it was<br/>
probably dangerous to do so!<br/>
