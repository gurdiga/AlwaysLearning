<div id="ygrps-yiv-1415078211">I had this discussion with a church friend of mine who said I was &quot;playing interference&quot; between my children and other adults.  She noticed that I would sometimes step in and &quot;rescue&quot; them if they were silent when an adult asked a question, I would speak for them, or, if someone was reprimanding them or disciplining them for doing something wrong.  I explained that I don&#39;t believe it is someone else&#39;s responsibility to teach or correct my children.  Her response:  How will they ever learn how to deal with other people on their own if you are stepping in and saving them all the time?<br/>
What do you think?<br/>
I should add that this woman thinks  my children &quot;get away with&quot; crying when they don&#39;t get what they want, or &#39;manipulating&#39; me into doing something they want vs. what I want.  I tried to explain that I am in control of my decisions and I make my choices, but she just didn&#39;t get it.</div>

My primary advice on this is not to have discussions with church  <br/>
friends.  Not about liberal childrearing practices.  Not with most  <br/>
churches.<br/>

Her beliefs are parroted after what has been parroted after others for  <br/>
a hundred years.  You can ignore her, or you can say &quot;I&#39;ll think about  <br/>
it,&quot; or &quot;Do you really think so?&quot; or you can avoid her, but she  <br/>
doesn&#39;t WANT to get it, and she&#39;s not going to get it.<br/>

You might not find a church that fits anymore.  That&#39;s been my problem for<br/>
close to 2 1/2 decades now.   As to the way I chose to raise Karl, I don&#39;t<br/>
care what other adults think.  No one gets to discipline him unless they<br/>
have the law on their side.  Right now, I&#39;m in charge.  This includes my own<br/>
folks.  If they try, I stop going over for a while and cool off.  I don&#39;t<br/>
face off with them about it because I want to keep up with them but they<br/>
know I always side with Karl.  I don&#39;t let them take charge because I know<br/>
what they believe about children.  As for what they say about it, it&#39;s the<br/>
same stuff as your church lady says.  I thank them and change the subject<br/>
immediately.  These days, I&#39;m pretty adept at it cuz they started as soon as<br/>
he was born.  ;)<br/>

&gt;    <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that IS how they will learn - to be helpful and kind, <br/>
especially, and not to let someone else suffer needlessly when they <br/>
could make things better. But, also, they&#39;ll learn from you how to <br/>
respond to awkward or hostile situations (or even pleasant ones).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d rescue my husband in the same way. It is the kind thing to do.<br/>
<br/>
I can look back and vaguely remember when I thought all the time about <br/>
what my kids were or were not learning.<br/>
<br/>
It is way better to think about how &quot;I&quot; am behaving - am I being <br/>
interesting and kind and gentle and supportive and understanding and <br/>
sympathetic and realistic and so on.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

My son 16 years old, has commented that he feels he relates to others better since he has had me to watch all these years.  My husband doesn&#39;t enjoy talking.  With anyone.  He is very quite.  He likes it that way.  He is not rude or disrespectful, just quite.<br/>

<br/>
Good for you! I think that &quot;playing interference&quot; - being a buffer between <br/>
our children and the rest of the world - is one of the prime functions of a good <br/>
parent. <br/>
<br/>
Children learn how to deal with other people by having it modeled for them.<br/>
