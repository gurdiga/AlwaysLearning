<div id="ygrps-yiv-502728745">I actually use your website a lot when I get asked questions about<br/>
unschooling.  People wanting to know more, or people asking specific<br/>
questions.  Not only that, but, there is still a list or two that I&#39;m on<br/>
where I&#39;m the only RU.  So, when a parent asks for help, I&#39;m likely to back<br/>
up my advice with a link or two to your website.  Thanks so much for putting<br/>
it all together and keeping it up and running.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s how I found out about radical unschooling in the first place - <br/>
not Jennifer specifically (that I can recall, it was a few years ago) -<br/>
 but there was one person who frequently posted links to Sandra&#39;s site <br/>
until I finally &quot;bit&quot; and went to have a look. Its a great resource, <br/>
especially with all the links to others&#39; sites, too. <br/>

Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really grateful to all the people who have written such great  <br/>
things over the years and let me use them.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like a quilt made out of other people&#39;s cloth, most of the  <br/>
pages.  Probably less than half of what&#39;s there is my writing.<br/>
<br/>
Some people wish it was organized so they could read it all and know  <br/>
they had, but it&#39;s not. &lt;g&gt;  And by the time they could get all the  <br/>
way through there would be something else added anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I admire the organization of Joyce&#39;s page:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
When it was new, a person could read it all.<br/>
I think it has recently passed that point.  If someone read really  <br/>
fast, maybe... but Joyce is starting to add other people&#39;s writings  <br/>
too, and I think by the time you finished, some pages would have been  <br/>
added to, and new pages added.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a bad thing at all! &lt;g&gt;  If people poke around  <br/>
and follow links and get ideas to try, and then they go be with their  <br/>
kids for hours or days and only come back when they need to, my site  <br/>
will be doing exactly what I hoped it would do, which is put some  <br/>
helpful ideas where people can find them.<br/>
<br/>
One of my favorite pages these days is this:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/learning">http://sandradodd.com/learning</a><br/>
<br/>
The links at the bottom look better on my Mac than on Marty&#39;s or  <br/>
Holly&#39;s PCs but on any of them, if you make the window narrower or  <br/>
wider it all moves around.  It was fun to do links without words.   <br/>
It&#39;s an adventure for the reader.<br/>
<br/>
