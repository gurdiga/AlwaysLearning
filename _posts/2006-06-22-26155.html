Those would be mine:) I added a few (11)more so this is a lil long but  <br/>
here&#39;s part of our past year..<br/>
 <br/>
1 Cassidy is one showing off her new lost teeth. We read a great book about  <br/>
a sister and brother loosing teeth a few weeks ago. The older sister was <br/>
loosing  teeth and the lil brother was sad he didn&#39;t so he pretended he lost a <br/>
tooth (he  put corn under his pillow). The tooth fairy came and welcomed them to <br/>
the place  where teeth go. In the end a machine rejected the lil brothers fake <br/>
tooth and  the tooth fairy explained that some day he too would loose his <br/>
teeth when  they were ready. It was a tiny book but the story was interesting to <br/>
read.<br/>
 <br/>
The second is my favorite shot of Dustin in his 3D glasses(Adventures Shark  <br/>
Boy and Lava Girl movie we had seen).<br/>
 <br/>
3 Is Cameron hamming it up in an outfit I got that was too small. I took  the <br/>
photo bc I knew it would be the first and last time he wore it.<br/>
 <br/>
4 & 5 is Cassidy and Nicholas in the whelping box with puppies  from spring <br/>
of 05. We lost the mama of those puppies two month later. She had a  tumor we <br/>
discovered when we redid her OFA&#39;s. Special photo.. 5 is one of her  pups we <br/>
sold to friends.<br/>
 <br/>
6 is my Durango (rango) after the convention. The lettering is bad:).  I <br/>
applied that before we left to go to Peabody then it rained during the  convention <br/>
so I reapplied sometime after midnight not quite seeing straight...  happily <br/>
graffiti-ing my own vehicle :)<br/>
 <br/>
7 is Dustin on the way back from Pinebush, NY for a business trip we  took <br/>
together. Talking about communication one on one this was bliss. There  is no <br/>
way we could have talked that in depth with a car load of toddlers on a  one way <br/>
5+ hr road trip. The rest areas were a blast and it was so nice not  to ride <br/>
alone. <br/>
 <br/>
8 On 95 crossing in NH some guy on a motor cycle was doing a long  wheel-ly <br/>
that seemed like a good 3/4 of a mile at 70 MPH! Dustin took a few of  the <br/>
shots. We never good a real good one but it was a sight to see. The other  photo <br/>
missing is of our trip to Canada.<br/>
 <br/>
9 Is Dustin in his riding gear. Gosh he looks much older there.<br/>
 <br/>
10 Cameron this May giving a little too much love to a  puppy:)<br/>
 <br/>
11 Cassidy at the Peabody in the &quot;craft&quot;/ BUSY room:)<br/>
 <br/>
12 The kids and I (me breathing deeply wishing I could poof out of there.)  <br/>
at the gym in Maine. Not a good trip for any of us either time we went. I  <br/>
don&#39;t know why but none of us felt right. So hard to balance(well  generally I do <br/>
fine but it rather sucked and rock climbing is not for us right  now). We&#39;d <br/>
rather come and go so it&#39;s a tuff balance to explain to those field  trip <br/>
pushers...  A friend called Nicholas and Cameron whinny and bratty I  knew I had <br/>
enough then. Thank you to unschooling I was able to regroup (focus)  and know it <br/>
was ok to get us out of there. Nothing food and space couldn&#39;t  solve.. I <br/>
added this photo bc it&#39;s sorta recent and i&#39;m in it.<br/>
 <br/>
13,14 & 15 are of a trip to Utah.<br/>
 A photo I took of a mountain behind the flats just before Nevada. My  sister <br/>
and I took the (3 hours from UT)kids to the casino for an all you can  eat. <br/>
We tried to play a few slots on the way out however it turns out with  children <br/>
that&#39;s illegal, whod-a thunk it? <br/>
Funny story on this.. On the way back we had been looking for salt but  <br/>
everything was unusually wet. We stopped at one of the Morton Salt piles on the  <br/>
side of the road and filled a ziplock bag. A few days later I left for home  and <br/>
had my bags flagged for inspection. I was mortified when I realized they  <br/>
spotted the bag of salt. All I could think is people were going to think.. me,  <br/>
standing there with 3 children was smuggling SALT! lol Every one stopped and  <br/>
looked at the ongoing inspection, ugh! Funny now but not then.. I kept looking  <br/>
at people going, it&#39;s salt! It&#39;s only salt!<br/>
15( is my first tumble weed sighting. I tried to ship this one how but  <br/>
everyone thought i was nuts...<br/>
 <br/>
16 the not so Man on the mountain in NH.<br/>
17 & 18 are of Dustin and I&#39;s business trip to Canada in August. I  loved <br/>
this trip! Well, I got a speeding ticket just as I reentered the US that  was <br/>
just wrong it was my birthday too). Dustin and I went shopping, rocked out  on <br/>
the ride and brought home some neat stuff. We live about 4 hrs from  Canada.<br/>
 <br/>
19, 20 & 21 are of Cassidy, Nicholas and Cameron at the computer,  watching <br/>
the Incredibles (which happens to also be on right now) and Nicholas  with the <br/>
spring 06 puppies.<br/>
