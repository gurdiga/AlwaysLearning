<div id="ygrps-yiv-2043795107">oooh!  Oooh!!!<br/>
<br/>
I was just addressing a packet to Joyce Fetteroll, and thinking about other <br/>
things, and I purposely wrote my own return addres is my most normal cursive, <br/>
thinking in case she analyzes handwriting to any degree it would be good to <br/>
let her see mine.<br/>
<br/>
THEN my main brain realized what the corner of my brain was muttering.<br/>
<br/>
HEY!  I miss seeing people&#39;s handwriting.  <br/>
<br/>
I love Christmas cards, because I see handwritten notes (if I&#39;m lucky), and I <br/>
love to see my address written in other people&#39;s handwriting.  <br/>
<br/>
But the same way there&#39;s a prejudicial aspect of dealing in person which we <br/>
avoid in online discussions, where we deal with ideas in the absence of <br/>
body-language and facial clues and eye-movement, there are handwriting <br/>
prejudices too.  <br/>
<br/>
I have a little bit of a lefty-nervousness, which is funny because my husband <br/>
and mid-kid are lefties.  But I&#39;m never happy to know someone&#39;s a lefty.  <br/>
It&#39;s not rational, it&#39;s just a bristly suspicion of darkest evil on my part.  <br/>
It passes.   <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t really fully like to see people write or throw things with their left <br/>
hands.  It just seems wrong.  <br/>
<br/>
So now!  I don&#39;t know which of you are lefties!  <br/>
<br/>
And you all don&#39;t have to see when I&#39;m wearing the same sweatshirt I slept in <br/>
and having brushed my hair for a couple of days!  Isn&#39;t this nice?<br/>
<br/>
But seriously, the handwriting analysis might become a lost art.  That&#39;s <br/>
okay, I suppose.  I don&#39;t have to see whether any of you dot your i&#39;s with <br/>
little hearts or bubbles.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1640204090">I have a couple of very close friends, one of whom lives in Norway (the <br/>
other&#39;s in Virginia). Both of these friends I met and befriended entirely <br/>
online, via email and various instant messenger services. However, as of <br/>
about a year or so ago, we began faxing one another letters so that we could <br/>
doodle in the margins and see each others handwriting. It was fun - <br/>
especially as I&#39;d never used the fax machine before, and had previously had <br/>
no idea how it worked. After a few letters via the fax machine, we started <br/>
sending one another letters through the post, which was even nicer. I really <br/>
like the handwriting of both of my friends, and I like being able to write to <br/>
them even when I can&#39;t get online (usually because someone else is using the <br/>
computer). <br/>
<br/>
Sending and receiving handwritten letters is fun, even if my writing is <br/>
pretty illegible, unless I put a conscious effort into it. <br/>

Marty is left handed for eating and art and writing, but when he played <br/>
hockey, he was right handed.  <br/>
I just went and inquired as to his left and right handedness.  He said he <br/>
doesn&#39;t know about batting (he hasn&#39;t played) but he throws a ball right <br/>
handed.  I asked about chopping wood--axe or hatchet.  He said either left or <br/>
right.  But he can&#39;t write or draw with his right hand.<br/>

on no evidence whatsoever.<br/>
I worked on research into brain function and handedness and there was no<br/>
statistical difference in reading age or ability between right-handers,<br/>
left-handers and ambidextrous.<br/>
Despite this, I had a doctor who told me (in apparent seriousness) that<br/>
I suffered from depression becasue I was left-handed....<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure ambidextrous is the same as mixed dominance.  People who are <br/>
ambidextrous can do things like write or use scissors with either <br/>
hand.  People with mixed dominance use their right hand for some things and <br/>
the left for others, but can&#39;t switch easily to the other.<br/>

bright, but had an awful time learning to read and still doesn&#39;t like <br/>
to.  He doesn&#39;t believe he&#39;s bright, though, because of the reading <br/>
difficulty.  I&#39;m not looking for a label for him, but explanations of why <br/>
something might be hard for him are always welcome.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
