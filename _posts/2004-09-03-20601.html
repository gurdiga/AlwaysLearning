Subject: New Unschooling List<br/>
<br/>
This new list is a place to exchange stories from our unschooling<br/>
lives. Describe how your child learned to read without a curriculum.<br/>
Tell us anecdotes of how your child made unexpected connections. How<br/>
does your child learn math through play and everyday activities?<br/>
<br/>
  Unschooling is &quot;not schooling.&quot; This list is for stories of how<br/>
unschooling works. We&#39;ll learn from each other by sharing experiences<br/>
and observations. It is not a discussion list, not a debate list, and<br/>
not really even a &quot;support&quot; or &quot;advice&quot; list.<br/>
<br/>
  The lis owner will suggest topics, but any unschooling anecdote is<br/>
always welcome. All posts will go first to the list owner for approval.<br/>
The format of this list is somewhat reminiscent of a magazine, with the<br/>
list owner playing the role of editor. But, posts do not not need to be<br/>
&quot;formal&quot; - brief anecdotes are as welcome as more lengthy stories.<br/>
<br/>
  Welcome ----<br/>
