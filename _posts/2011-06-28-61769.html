<div id="ygrps-yiv-474020205">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
My daughter Rowan (newly 5yo) played at online chess with her uncle this <br/>
weekend, and she is now very interested in learning and playing online. I know <br/>
nothing about chess, so I don&#39;t feel that I am very helpful at getting her <br/>
started. I&#39;m happy to learn along with her, though I would like to find a kid <br/>
friendly online site for both learning to play and playing by herself. Any <br/>
suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
Lisa B<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-980848598">My kids, ages 4.5 and 6, like to play around here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shredderchess.com/play-chess-online.html.">http://www.shredderchess.com/play-chess-online.html.</a> When the player clicks on a chess piece, the game highlights the places on the board where that piece can move. They&#39;re starting to really get it, just playing around.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ve also played some of the games here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.learn4good.com/games/board.htm.">http://www.learn4good.com/games/board.htm.</a>  I don&#39;t have flash at the moment, but if I remember correctly, the &quot;crazy chess&quot; game was lots and lots of fun.<br/>
