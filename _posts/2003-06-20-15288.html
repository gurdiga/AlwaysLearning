<div id="ygrps-yiv-1069232163">This made me think of when my son Shawn was off and about in a store with me. <br/>
 Some kid asked where he went to school, and he said he homeschooled <br/>
(remember, this is almost 20 years ago), the kid said does that mean you get all F&#39;s?<br/>
<br/>
Shawn came and found me to ask if getting all F&#39;s meant you really learned <br/>
alot.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe my mom was right, homeschooling over-sheltered the kids!  :-)<br/>
