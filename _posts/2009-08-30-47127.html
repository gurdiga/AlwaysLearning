<br/>
The Certificate of Empowerment has been translated into Spanish by  <br/>
Joanette Aponte Yunqu√©.  She first put it on Facebook, but now I&#39;ve  <br/>
given it two pages on my site.<br/>
<br/>
I already mentioned the socialization page here, but the advance-bonus  <br/>
disks for Lee Stranahan&#39;s project on unschooling should be arriving  <br/>
soon, and I hope to have mine to take to the Good Vibrations  <br/>
conference for people to watch.<br/>
