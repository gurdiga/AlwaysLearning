I fully understand what you are saying, can I ask an honest question? Do you think if your child had more exposure to tv he would stay mesmerized all the time by it? Or do you think that because it was so &#39;new&#39; to him it was a source of fascination? I liken it to when I am on a &#39;diet&#39;..When I am, and I try to &#39;limit&#39; my sweets/fats, anytime I am around something sweet (chocolate is the worst!!) or fattening (French fries!!!) I almost feel like I HAVE to have them..It&#39;s a craving!  But, when I am not on a &#39;diet&#39; when I am just eating what I want and not counting calories or fat, then my consumption of those things are very easily limited..I can say &quot;Nah I dont feel like that right now&quot; much easier in those situations.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if that analogy is making sense, but do you think it&#39;s possible that by limiting the TV you will find that when the time comes for you and you DO introduce it, it will be something your son will want almost constantly because it is &#39;special&#39; and &#39;new&#39;? <br/>
<br/>
And do you think that you will follow this type of an example for a lot of other things in your family&#39;s life? (Ie you decide whether or not it should be introduced and when, and set those limits for your son?) If so, what types of things do you see this being the &#39;norm&#39; for?<br/>
<br/>
Feel free if you&#39;d like to continue this with me offlist if it would be more comfortable for you, I am enjoying our exchange as well but dont want you to feel like you are having to argue your points with anyone in order to answer my questions honestly =).<br/>

  I cannot recall if I included this, but we have plans to at some point when<br/>
  the time instinctively feels right, to include media such as televison,<br/>
  because of several reasons, including but not limited to the fact that it is<br/>
  not avoidable in the wide world, and one needs to be educated about the<br/>
  effects of media, the power it can have, and the lack of reality of much of<br/>
  it.  Also, I expect to enjoy with him, at the appropriate time, films and<br/>
  video that add  dimension  to learning about the world at large.  However at<br/>
  a young age, I think he has enough important things to learn about his<br/>
  little world he lives in and that is best done through his experiences with<br/>
  his world, friends, environment etc.<br/>
<br/>
  My son has had a few unplanned tv viewings, and I was distressed by the<br/>
  memorized state he went in to, and he wanted to be 1 inch away from it the<br/>
  entire time.  Also, my son has is spirited and passionate, easily<br/>
  overstimulated by environments that are chaotic or noisy and hyper.  My<br/>
  instincts are that he is better off without tv for quite some time (videos<br/>
  too, except we do view our family life videos on our computer, because it is<br/>
  real to us and helps us enjoy our past and present.)  I may add he is also<br/>
  very verbal, surprisingly early, and loves to converse, is very social with<br/>
  strangers and friends and seems to enjoy his life very much.  He is<br/>
  sensitive to the feelings of others, and easily concerned if he hears<br/>
  another child crying, wanting to help or get him help.  I feel good about<br/>
  his little person and I think he does too.  I feel good about protecting his<br/>
  innocence and childhood at this time in his life.  Childhood is short, life<br/>
  compartively long, plenty of time to add vices, but hard to learn what life<br/>
  would be like without them once vice is established.<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks for your civil discourse during this thread, I appreciate the ability<br/>
  to discuss different choices without feeling or feeling the need to be<br/>
  arguementative.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>hmm, wonder if he was so memorized by the tv<br/>
because he&#39;d never seen it before?  I often<br/>
wonder at our children, my daughter walks<br/>
down the isle of a store conversing with her<br/>
father on the cell phone without any idea<br/>
that this is a relatively new thing to do and<br/>
still a bit amazing to her mother.  My 3 year<br/>
old asks daddy to &quot;set it up so I can chat<br/>
with mommy&quot; (aim chat) without any clue that<br/>
this is amazing.  I think about how people<br/>
must have been memorized by indoor plumbing<br/>
at first, or, even better, talking movies.<br/>
<br/>
This kind of reminds me of a scientific<br/>
America I saw, yes, on tv.  It was very<br/>
interesting... here let me find the link...<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.pbs.org/saf/1110/resources/transcript.htm">http://www.pbs.org/saf/1110/resources/transcript.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
the part that I find interesting and relevent<br/>
is:<br/>
<br/>
                              ALAN ALDA<br/>
(NARRATION) We&#39;re back in the lab for another<br/>
<br/>
                              experiment on<br/>
kids&#39; attitudes to food. We&#39;re going to turn<br/>
one of<br/>
                              these foods<br/>
into forbidden fruit.<br/>
<br/>
                              JENNIFER FISHER<br/>
In the beginning of this study we basically<br/>
are<br/>
                              offering<br/>
children a wheat cracker and a Goldfish<br/>
cracker, and we&#39;re<br/>
                              offering them<br/>
in equal amounts because we want children to<br/>
have<br/>
                              the ability to<br/>
have equal sort of access to both of these<br/>
foods.<br/>
<br/>
                              ALAN ALDA<br/>
(NARRATION) First they want to make sure the<br/>
kids will at<br/>
                              least eat<br/>
Goldfish. In fact they all eat a bit of both,<br/>
but not a lot of<br/>
                              anything. But<br/>
now, the status of Goldfish is about to be<br/>
transformed.<br/>
<br/>
                              JENNIFER FISHER<br/>
In the second part, we&#39;re actually going to<br/>
change<br/>
                              the rules, so<br/>
that they can still have as many wheat<br/>
crackers as they<br/>
                              want, but the<br/>
Goldfish crackers are going to become off<br/>
limits. When<br/>
                              I ring the<br/>
bell, you guys are going to be able to eat<br/>
the Goldfish<br/>
                              crackers, okay?<br/>
So there are no goldfish crackers until we<br/>
ring the<br/>
                              bell.<br/>
<br/>
                              ALAN ALDA<br/>
(NARRATION) For an agonizing 5 minutes, those<br/>
delicious,<br/>
                              desirable,<br/>
fantastic Goldfish are absolutely<br/>
unobtainable.<br/>
<br/>
                              JENNIFER FISHER<br/>
In one more minute I&#39;m going to ring the<br/>
bell, OK?<br/>
                              Do you know<br/>
what that means when we ring the bell? OK.<br/>
<br/>
                              ALAN ALDA<br/>
(NARRATION) At last it&#39;s Goldfish time, and<br/>
you don&#39;t have<br/>
                              to be a<br/>
psychologist to figure out what happens. The<br/>
kids pig out.<br/>
                              It&#39;s a<br/>
forbidden fruit effect.<br/>
<br/>
                              GIRL She got a<br/>
lot.<br/>
<br/>
                              ALAN ALDA<br/>
(NARRATION) Clearly this isn&#39;t the way to<br/>
change kids&#39;<br/>
                              eating habits.<br/>
<br/>
                              JENNIFER FISHER<br/>
Paradoxically, restriction not only is not an<br/>
effective<br/>
                              way of<br/>
promoting moderation, but it seems to promote<br/>
the behaviors<br/>
                              that parents<br/>
intend to avoid by using that practice.<br/>

you know what tummy that is?<br/>

Empty.<br/>

                              LORI FRANCIS<br/>
That&#39;s an empty tummy, alright. What kind of<br/>
tummy is<br/>
                              this?<br/>

                              ELIZABETH Um<br/>

now?<br/>
<br/>
                              ALAN ALDA<br/>
(NARRATION) In our next experiment, we&#39;re<br/>
working with<br/>
                              kids who&#39;ve<br/>
just had a meal. They shouldn&#39;t feel hungry.<br/>

                              ELIZABETH Full.<br/>
<br/>
                              LORI FRANCIS<br/>
It&#39;s full. OK. We&#39;ve got pretzels, peanuts<br/>
<br/>
                              ALAN ALDA<br/>
(NARRATION) Now Elizabeth is shown a large<br/>
tray of<br/>
                              snacks - chips,<br/>
ice cream, cookies -- and popcorn, which she<br/>
likes.<br/>
<br/>
                              LORI FRANCIS<br/>
and chocolate chip cookies. Alright? Now I<br/>
need to<br/>
                              go next door<br/>
for about ten minutes to do some work,<br/>
alright? I&#39;m just<br/>
                              going to leave<br/>
this. This is extra food that we have. If you<br/>
don&#39;t want<br/>
                              it, you know,<br/>
you don&#39;t have to eat it, but if you want to,<br/>
you can eat<br/>
                              anything you<br/>
want. And we also have this box of toys here,<br/>
this pen<br/>
                              here, it&#39;s a<br/>
drawing pen, so, you can write on that. So,<br/>
I&#39;m going to<br/>
                              leave this box<br/>
with you and I&#39;m also going to leave the tray<br/>
with you.<br/>
<br/>
                              ALAN ALDA<br/>
(NARRATION) Elizabeth, once left alone,<br/>
behaves in a way<br/>
                              that might<br/>
surprise you. She ignores the food.<br/>
<br/>
                              LEANN BIRCH So<br/>
far at least, Elizabeth isumnot terribly<br/>
interested<br/>
                              in eating.<br/>
<br/>
                              ALAN ALDA<br/>
(NARRATION) It takes a while before, bored<br/>
with the toys,<br/>
                              she finally<br/>
gets around to trying just some popcorn - her<br/>
favorite<br/>
                              food. Now take<br/>
a look at Morgan. When he&#39;s left alone he<br/>
digs in.<br/>
                              Here&#39;s the<br/>
important point. Morgan comes from a home<br/>
where access<br/>
                              to these<br/>
attractive sweet or salty snack foods is<br/>
strictly controlled,<br/>
                              whereas<br/>
Elizabeth is unrestricted.<br/>
<br/>

Parents who tended to use a fair amount of<br/>
restrictive<br/>
                              feeding<br/>
practices -- namely parents who are concerned<br/>
about their<br/>
                              kids consuming<br/>
too many of these kinds of palatable foods<br/>
and who<br/>
                              restricted<br/>
their kids&#39; opportunities to eat those things<br/>
-- actually had<br/>
                              the children<br/>
who ate the most.<br/>

you came home and had any one of those snack<br/>
foods<br/>
                              without asking<br/>
your parents first, would they be upset? And<br/>
when<br/>
                              you have ice<br/>
cream, can you have as much as you want, or<br/>
does<br/>
                              your mom dish<br/>
out a certain amount for you?<br/>

dishes out a certain amount for me.<br/>

Restriction actually tends to foster<br/>
consumption in the<br/>
                              absence of<br/>
hunger in children, and increased interest in<br/>
the very<br/>
                              foods that<br/>
parents think children shouldn&#39;t be eating,<br/>
and<br/>
                              conversely,<br/>
pressuring children to eat, er, healthy foods<br/>
tends to<br/>
                              turn them off,<br/>
with respect to those foods. So what do you<br/>
do<br/>
                              instead? I<br/>
would think, as a parent, that&#39;s really the<br/>
tough part. I<br/>
                              think there are<br/>
a couple of things. One is, we need to help<br/>
parents<br/>
                              to understand<br/>
what are reasonable portion sizes for<br/>
children, so that<br/>
                              parents have<br/>
reasonable expectations about how much foods<br/>
kids<br/>
                              need to eat.<br/>
The other thing is we need to, I think, help<br/>
parents to<br/>
                              appreciate how<br/>
children learn to like foods that aren&#39;t<br/>
sweet and<br/>
                              that aren&#39;t<br/>
salty. And the way that you do that is you<br/>
have to, I<br/>
                              think, be<br/>
pretty patient as a parent. We know that kids<br/>
initially reject<br/>
                              a lot of new<br/>
foods unless they&#39;re sweet or salty, and it&#39;s<br/>
only with<br/>
                              repeated<br/>
presentations, non-coercive presentations,<br/>
that kids learn<br/>
                              to eat a lot of<br/>
those foods.<br/>
<br/>
                              ALAN ALDA<br/>
(NARRATION) Without that kind of perceptive<br/>
parenting,<br/>
                              our kids are<br/>
caught in two terrible traps. First we say<br/>
finish your<br/>
                              food, then we<br/>
put too much food on the plate. Then we say<br/>
that high<br/>
                              fat, high<br/>
calorie snack foods are forbidden -- so kids<br/>
want to binge<br/>
                              on them. But it<br/>
gets worse. Take a look at our next story.<br/>
<br/>
OK there is a LOT more, and it&#39;s really<br/>
interestinga nd worth going to read, but the<br/>
point is, I wonder if for kids who are<br/>
forbidden something, that they want it more.<br/>
Even if it&#39;s tv.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I want to protect my children&#39;s innocence<br/>
too.  I want them to be kids.  We, my kids<br/>
and I, talk about this a lot.  I don&#39;t forbid<br/>
Lexie to watch things, but I do highly<br/>
suggest that something isn&#39;t appropriate for<br/>
a six year old. However, on occassion I have<br/>
let her watch something I felt was not<br/>
appropriate.  A good example of this was the<br/>
show that came on after star trek.  She<br/>
watched it 3-4 times, it&#39;s like a cross<br/>
between a cop show and the x files, can&#39;t<br/>
remember the name. Anyway, on the 5th or so<br/>
show, she got scared!  She has not watched it<br/>
since and she&#39;s more willing to listen to me<br/>
when I say something isn&#39;t appropriate.  I<br/>
also came intot he room and she was reading<br/>
one of my holocaust books.  She is six, and I<br/>
just am not ready for her to go there.  I<br/>
asked her to trust me on this and wait.  She<br/>
said ok. Id idn&#39;t move the books or box them<br/>
up or get rid of them. They are still<br/>
available to her.  But because I trust her<br/>
and she trusts me, I don&#39;t think she will<br/>
read them.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone on this list wants our<br/>
children to loose their innocence<br/>
prematurely, I think we (or me, I should only<br/>
speak for myself) are working hard at seeing<br/>
our children as independent beings with<br/>
wonderful minds and the ability to make<br/>
choices for themselves.<br/>
