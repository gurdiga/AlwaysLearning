Sounds like a possibility for something at the Conference...like we had that<br/>
other storyteller that time in SC. <br/>

This troubador-one (Beth) is 90 miles away, though, and not (as far as I know) a <br/>
homeschooling mom.  There is someone in town who has homeschooled until this year one <br/>
of her three is in school (at her husband&#39;s insistence), and she&#39;s interested in doing a story-<br/>
telling session.  Ramona King--used to live in Houston, and so some of you might have seen <br/>
her elsewhere.  Her daughter, Tamarind, won a national storytelling competition a year and <br/>
some back.<br/>

My e-mail seems messed up.  I might&#39;ve messed it up myself somehow, but if anyone e-<br/>
mailed me on the side yesterday afternoon, maybe try again.  Thanks.<br/>

In case you didn&#39;t get my reply to you, here it is again:<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the paragraph suggestion. I&#39;m going to take care of that <br/>
today. My site is at homestead.com, they&#39;re like the hosting service <br/>
for people who don&#39;t know how to build a site. LOL I don&#39;t even know <br/>
what a source code is. <br/>
 <br/>
As for unschooling.com...thanks for mentioning it. I actually meant <br/>
for that link to be unschooling.info but must have been distracted <br/>
when I added it. I just changed it. <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for all you do...I really do appreciate it!<br/>
