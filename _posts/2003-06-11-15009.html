<div id="ygrps-yiv-1669467782">Sandra, I just wanted to take a second to say thanks for your reply to <br/>
my question about my dh&#39;s need to press my girls to do stuff.  Your <br/>
response was what I&#39;d been thinking and I appreciate knowing I&#39;m on the <br/>
right track.  I&#39;m doubt I could ever get him to read any books on <br/>
homeschooling or unschooling, but I might be able to persuade him to <br/>
read an article or to...probably yours :).  So thanks for taking the <br/>
time to reply.  I appreciate you.  HeidiC.</div>

<br/>
Well...<br/>
If your husband would hate my ideas, that might be the WRONG track! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But you&#39;re welcome to whatever ends up helping, and *sorry* for anything that <br/>
ends up making anything worse. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
