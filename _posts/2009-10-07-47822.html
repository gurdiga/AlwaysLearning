<div id="ygrps-yiv-1445315180">I was interviewed last week and I made it its own page this morning  <br/>
with the sound file, photos and links:<br/>

<br/>
Although it&#39;s a Law of Attraction &quot;station&quot; (podcast), I told her I  <br/>
didn&#39;t subscribe to that and it might be better not to bring it up.   <br/>
But it was a fun interview and on the page I was able to expand on a  <br/>
thing or two and put links.<br/>
<br/>
If you do listen to it and think of other things I should write or  <br/>
link, please let me know.<br/>
<br/>
Today Dayna Martin is being interviewed, 11:00 PST, noon mountain  <br/>
time.  It will be available to listen to later, too.<br/>
