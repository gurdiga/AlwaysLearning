<div id="ygrps-yiv-1225852547">&lt;&lt; I drove past a Thai restaurant this past week<br/>
named.....Phuket &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I went to college in Portland, Oregon, in the late &#39;80s.  There was a <br/>
restaurant downtown, in Chinatown, that was open super-late, and people <br/>
tended to go there after a long night of drinking.  It was called &quot;Hung Phar <br/>
Low.&quot;  Not sure if it&#39;s still there, but it was always fun to say...<br/>
