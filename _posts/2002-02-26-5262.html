<div id="ygrps-yiv-302447212">Here, I found it, as soon as I sent my last post, naturally...<br/>
<br/>
 From <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.wellbutrin-side-effects.com/">http://www.wellbutrin-side-effects.com/</a><br/>
How is Wellbutrin different from other antidepressants?<br/>
<br/>
Classified as a dopamine-reuptake blocking compound, Wellbutrin has a<br/>
chemical structure unrelated to any other antidepressant medication.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike some of the other recently developed antidepressants (i.e., Celexa,<br/>
Paxil, Prozac, and Zoloft) that target the brain chemical serotonin,<br/>
Wellbutrin acts on the brain chemicals dopamine and norepinephrine.<br/>
<br/>
Because of its unique makeup, Wellbutrin also has different side effects,<br/>
and it may work for individuals who have not had success with other<br/>
antidepressants.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
So unlike Prozac, which only helps you think clearer and reestablish more <br/>
brainpaths, Wellbutrin IS a happy-pill??<br/>
<br/>
(Somehow I can&#39;t find it in me to think that&#39;s immoral...)<br/>

Well, I consider antidepressants as immoral as antibiotics... (and I know<br/>
you do too!) Oddly, Effexor (similar to Prozac) totally numbed me out. I<br/>
couldn&#39;t cry, didn&#39;t particularly want to laugh, couldn&#39;t *feel*. I hated<br/>
it, although it got me through a couple of funerals in a socially acceptable<br/>
manner. It also numbed me out from the waist down, IYKWIM. How depressing is<br/>
*that*? And I had withdrawal, dizzy every time I missed a dose. I tried<br/>
decreasing the dose as much as possible, still didn&#39;t help.<br/>
<br/>
Wellbutrin, OTOH, doesn&#39;t make me feel happy, just normal. It&#39;d been so long<br/>
I&#39;d forgotten what that was. I&#39;ve been on it since August, and I&#39;m planning<br/>
to go off in the next few months. A lot of my stress was job-related and I<br/>
finally quit it completely (feels odd, but OK) so we&#39;ll see.<br/>
