&lt;&lt; Anyway, I&#39;m trying to figure out a way to let him know that there is a <br/>
chance his sentences will not fit their mold, will be odd to them--you <br/>
folks know what I mean...I&#39;m afraid someone will say something to him <br/>
about his abilities &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why don&#39;t you do it for him?  The &quot;rules&quot; about not helping and not cheating <br/>
don&#39;t apply to unschoolers.  If there&#39;s no grade and no competition, IF the <br/>
zoo thinks they need sentences (WE know they don&#39;t, and THEY think they&#39;re <br/>
testing the kids&#39; abilities to... to do what?  Schoolwork!?) then give the <br/>
zoo some sentences.  <br/>
<br/>
You could use the words in five sentences and let him pick the ones he likes, <br/>
and with that range of &quot;right&quot; sentences in front of him, he wouldn&#39;t <br/>
misunderstand the way the words are used.<br/>
<br/>
If what&#39;s happening is giving him ideas and new information, it&#39;s good.  If <br/>
it&#39;s just frustrating him, it&#39;s not good.  You don&#39;t have to cooperate in <br/>
&quot;not good.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my opinion.<br/>
