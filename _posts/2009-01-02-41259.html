<div id="ygrps-yiv-835427002">I&#39;ve only been part of this group for a short time, but the impact on my family is<br/>
enormously positive.<br/>
<br/>
A few weeks ago I wrote about my concern that <br/>
Logan, 2 yo, wanted to spend a lot of time watching the computer.<br/>
Your responses really helped.<br/>
I&#39;m enjoying it more, and I am really amazed at how much Logan learns every day without <br/>
me teaching him. <br/>
He can look at a tiny picture on You Tube or the Sesame Street web site and know<br/>
exactly which video it is by name...sometimes I don&#39;t even recognize them.<br/>
It&#39;s so cool. <br/>
<br/>
Whenever we are with our friends and their kids, my husband and I are always the<br/>
ones on the ground hanging out with the toddlers. Most of the other parents tell the kids <br/>
to go and play, they don&#39;t want to be with their own kids. A few weeks ago at a party a <br/>
friend said to me and another mom, while we were in a separate room with the kids, &quot;Why <br/>
don&#39;t you come and hang out with the people?&quot;. I probably would not have found that so <br/>
weird had I not been an Unschooling mom.<br/>
I want to be with my son. He and my husband are the most fun people I know. <br/>
<br/>
Today at a New year&#39;s party Logan said he wanted to go home. He&#39;s been a real homebody <br/>
lately.<br/>
My friend  said, &quot;Wow, that&#39;s a testament to you, Henry never wants to go home. You and <br/>
Logan must do a lot of fun things together&quot;.<br/>
I had not thought of it that way until she said it.<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I do not come from AP or Unschooling families, and none of our friends <br/>
are raising their kids the way we are, so this is as much a learning experience for us as it <br/>
is for Logan.<br/>
So, on this New Year&#39;s Day I want say thanks.<br/>
I feel freedom as a parent that I did not think was possible.</div>
