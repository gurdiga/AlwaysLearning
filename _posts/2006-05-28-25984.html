<div id="ygrps-yiv-1470822813">This week, while out to dinner with some families from my son&#39;s little<br/>
league team,  I finally experienced the &quot;what about socialization&quot;<br/>
question(much laughter ensued here as my 11yo is the most social party<br/>
organizing child they all know) , along with &quot;well, you make them learn<br/>
something everyday don&#39;t you? You&#39;re not just letting them hang out<br/>
around the swimming pool all day are you?&quot; and then the topper......&quot;how<br/>
will they learn to stand in line and deal with all of those other<br/>
frustrations that we have to deal with in real life?&quot;  I almost laughed<br/>
out loud....by living real life, of course!<br/>
 <br/>
I can&#39;t believe I made it through 10 years of home schooling without<br/>
these questions coming up. Everyone was always pretty supportive of us<br/>
home schooling.   The first time I mentioned we were unschooling out in<br/>
public (not to family or CLOSE friends) I was bombarded......it was o.k.<br/>
I didn&#39;t feel defensive. Actually I was laughing inside thinking about<br/>
how superficial and reactive  these questions were. <br/>
 I tried to reply a bit, but could tell that when I didn&#39;t cave and had<br/>
reasonable and rational answers that posed a different perspective on<br/>
living life and learning, these people weren&#39;t really interested in<br/>
hearing in depth answers and having their beliefs challenged.  So, we<br/>
chatted casually about it over dinner.<br/>
All of them were expressing disappointment with the school systems they<br/>
had their children in and that is how we got onto the subject of  home<br/>
schooling in the first place.....I just sat and listened to their<br/>
frustrations with their various schools, reasons why they couldn&#39;t home<br/>
school and their surprise at the concept of unschooling.<br/>
I felt sorry for them....they seemed trapped in the mindset that they<br/>
can&#39;t do it....they have been brainwashed by the system.....someone even<br/>
brought up that I couldn&#39;t possibly be qualified to teach all the<br/>
subjects because I&#39;m not an expert on them all.....my husband and I had<br/>
a good laugh as we reminded them that the elementary teachers that they<br/>
leave their children with are probably less qualified than we are as<br/>
they are certainly not experts on the subjects they teach, most of them<br/>
don&#39;t even have children themselves or much life experience! I also<br/>
informed them that where I went to college for nursing, the ones that<br/>
couldn&#39;t make it through A and P and Chemistry usually ended up in the<br/>
pool of students going into education.<br/>
When  I reminded them that I&#39;m just there to help them learn how to<br/>
learn and support them and be a resource, they were dumbfounded......I<br/>
could see them wondering, how is she possibly going to fill them with<br/>
all that information that they would get in school..... I went on to<br/>
remind them that they and I learn things all the time without being<br/>
taught or forced to learn by someone. That no one chases them around<br/>
telling them, you better learn how to do this or that....that they do it<br/>
because they are interested, etc. etc.   <br/>
 It was amazing to watch some of them start to think a bit and then shut<br/>
themselves down with some of the questions listed above and go back to a<br/>
more comfortable place.  This exchange was good because it started with<br/>
all of them expressing dissatisfaction with the educational system,<br/>
then taking a brief look at our lifestyle and method and, if only for a<br/>
nano second, opening to a different possibility or way of doing things.<br/>
 <br/>
I look forward to more of these conversations with people as it<br/>
reinforces for me why we live the way we do and hopefully some of them<br/>
will see the light and form new perspectives and save their bright young<br/>
children from years of imprisonment!<br/>

You should go to the movies more, so they can practice standing in  <br/>
line.  And buy popcorn and candy—you&#39;ll have to stand in line to do  <br/>
that. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Laughing out loud is part of real life.  I have laughed when people  <br/>
ask me the crazy questions.   I&#39;ve also said &quot;You asked that last  <br/>
time, and they told you they don&#39;t HAVE a teacher—why are you asking  <br/>
the same thing again?&quot;  That would be Uncle Gerry. &lt;g&gt;  And I didn&#39;t  <br/>
ask him in a tone that suggested that he shouldn&#39;t discuss it, it was  <br/>
an honest question about why he doesn&#39;t even bother to remember or  <br/>
think about the answers. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
We do rock the bigger boat, doing what we do.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking about babysitting the other day (speaking of rocking,  <br/>
and rocking the larger cultural boat).  I was kind of daydreaming,  <br/>
casually running things through my mind while I was vacuuming and  <br/>
changing a bed and stuff.  Not serious thinking.  And I was thinking  <br/>
about babysitting, and the possibility and the very many downsides to  <br/>
daycare, maybe for older homeschooled kids, and the thoughts were  <br/>
just flowing.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking about how easy it was for people to babysit other  <br/>
people&#39;s kids in the 1950&#39;s and 60&#39;s compared to now.  Expectations  <br/>
were SO close, as to how kids should behave and be treated, and that  <br/>
was probably part of the whole idea of &quot;culture&quot; anyway, and  <br/>
especially protestant American culture (yeah, &quot;DUH&quot; I thought to  <br/>
myself, but not very consciously or hard), but now people have tons  <br/>
of different philosophies and practices and environments and even if  <br/>
there was nothing else but FOOD as an issue to consider I don&#39;t think  <br/>
I could babysit someone else&#39;s kids, not for cheap.  I was wondering  <br/>
to myself what I would want to charge for doing things the parents&#39;  <br/>
way.   And I figured out there probably wasn&#39;t any money under about  <br/>
$20 an hour that I would take to follow someone else&#39;s rules about  <br/>
food and behavior.  Not in MY house.  Maybe if I were a teen and  <br/>
babysitting in someone ELSE&#39;s house, *MAYBE*—but even then, to treat  <br/>
children by a list of rules instead of as real people, who have real  <br/>
interested, or who miss their mom, or who would rather talk to me  <br/>
about my real interests than to complete the list of chores their  <br/>
parents left, and eat what their parents said for them to eat WHEN  <br/>
their parents said to eat it, and then go to bed by the clock and be  <br/>
asleep by the clock...   I couldn&#39;t do that.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe this culture is coming out of the fog of a culture in which  <br/>
those who DID take care of other people&#39;s children were also  <br/>
themselves being treated as children.  Those whose children were  <br/>
&quot;minded&quot; had them minded by servants or slaves or poor neighbors who  <br/>
were because of necessity or class compelled to do just as the  <br/>
parents said.  Now that just everyone starts to feel they have rights  <br/>
and free will and the duty to use their best judgement, it&#39;s all  <br/>
going crazy! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So in a conversation in which others might once have easily  <br/>
intimidated one mom with pushy questions designed just for that  <br/>
purpose, now she can politely decide not to laugh right in their faces.<br/>
<br/>
If someone leaves a child here and tells me what they can and can&#39;t  <br/>
eat, what they can and can&#39;t play with, what they can and can&#39;t do as  <br/>
to video games and movies and such I will want to seriously say &quot;Take  <br/>
him with you, because if you want to leave him at my house, you&#39;re  <br/>
leaving him at MY house.  Capital MY.<br/>
<br/>
Generally that&#39;s been the deal when people have left kids here anyway— <br/>
they already knew me and my kids and how the place was likely to be  <br/>
hoppin&#39;, and that there would be food when kids wanted it, and they  <br/>
could sleep or not as they wanted, and all of that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Roya babysits quite a bit and, early on, she ran into some serious  <br/>
issues regarding parental expectations of how she&#39;d handle food and  <br/>
bedtimes. After a while, she decided to be upfront with the parents  <br/>
and compromise a little, but not too much - she tells them that she  <br/>
doesn&#39;t feel comfortable enforcing unhappy bedtimes or requiring kids  <br/>
to eat certain foods - and that she will, instead, help them settle  <br/>
down to fall asleep when they&#39;re tired and, although she won&#39;t try to  <br/>
make them eat anything, she won&#39;t give them food the parents say is  <br/>
off limits as long as it is put up way out of sight and out of reach.  <br/>
Anyway, she was able to say these things and the parents still LOVE  <br/>
her to babysit - she didn&#39;t argue with them or attack their  <br/>
parenting, just said this is what makes her feel comfortable about  <br/>
babysitting. TV and computers aren&#39;t usually an issue when she&#39;s  <br/>
babysitting because she does stuff with the kids - takes activities  <br/>
and crafts and games to do with them - and they look forward to that  <br/>
a lot.<br/>

Interests.<br/>
<br/>
My fingers have started typing without me a lot lately.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-TV and computers aren&#39;t usually an issue when she&#39;s<br/>

-=-<br/>
<br/>
She was at their house.<br/>
<br/>
I have friends who used to leave their kids here on short notice, and  <br/>
sometimes gave me money and more often didn&#39;t.  Often I knew it was  <br/>
because the parents were made at each other and hadn&#39;t coordinated  <br/>
their days well, because one parent would bring the kids in some  <br/>
pressured last-minute desperation, and the other parent would pick  <br/>
them up later, clearly flustered.<br/>
<br/>
So I figured every time that what the kids needed was a break.  None  <br/>
of them liked to discuss the parental problem if there was another  <br/>
kid there.  A couple of the three might talk to me about it if he or  <br/>
she was the only one there, but if there were two kids in earshot,  <br/>
there was  a total cut-off from even thinking of the parents, it  <br/>
seemed.   The parents are separated now; it didn&#39;t work out.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But what the kids needed, especially the boys, was escape.<br/>
<br/>
Their sister would sometimes just find a quiet place and draw or  <br/>
write or look out the window, or if Holly was there they would so  <br/>
something quiet and girly together.<br/>
<br/>
When I knew they were coming, I would check with my kids about what  <br/>
video systems could be set up for them to play, and I&#39;d try to have  <br/>
at least two systems, all set up and ready to go.  They could play  <br/>
alone or two together, but if I could let them just play and play and  <br/>
play, it seemed the best possible thing.<br/>
<br/>
At their house, even computer games were considered stupid.  At my  <br/>
house, I let them do what they wanted to do.  I fed them or didn&#39;t.   <br/>
I tried to make sure the temperature in the room was good and there  <br/>
was ventilation and they had a bottle of bought water.<br/>
<br/>
The parents would never have DARED suggest I do anything different,  <br/>
because I would have risen up and defended their kids to them, and  <br/>
they didn&#39;t want to risk for a second stirring up my commentary on  <br/>
how they were being as parents.<br/>
<br/>
Well!  I  didn&#39;t realize I still harbored some of the emotional  <br/>
defense I had about that. &lt;g&gt;  For a while, I was picking the mid-kid  <br/>
up after school one day a week and taking him to an animation project  <br/>
he was working on at the university.  He didn&#39;t want to be going to  <br/>
school.  His brother and sister were still homeschooled, but he was  <br/>
his dad&#39;s least favorite [clearly; not just my opinion] and he had  <br/>
made him to to Albuquerque Academy against his will, &quot;for his own good.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When they were younger, they and Holly used to do radio shows  <br/>
(there&#39;s one tape recorded somewhere) with commercials, usually  <br/>
involving pets or stuffed animals playing real animals.  There&#39;s a  <br/>
video they made once, before Holly knocked the video camera down and  <br/>
it broke.  Again, a play about a pet shop.  &lt;g&gt;  They had no pets at  <br/>
their house, so our dog and cats were also popular attractions.<br/>
<br/>
That wasn&#39;t babysitting so much as refuge, though.<br/>
