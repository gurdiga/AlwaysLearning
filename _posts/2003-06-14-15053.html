<div id="ygrps-yiv-418540828">I&#39;m speaking tomorrow at a homeschool conference, on using scouting in <br/>
homeschooling. I completed a handout, (i&#39;ll copy and paste it below, <br/>
maybe you all can tell me how stupid is,c orrect spelling,e tc.) and I <br/>
printed it and handed it to Lexie to read. I had been reading partsof it <br/>
to my mom on the hpone so Lexie said &quot;I don&#39;t need to read it, I heard <br/>
you reading it on the phone.&quot; I said &quot;consider it your edcatuional <br/>
activity for the day.&quot; She said &quot;mom, we don&#39;t do educational activities <br/>
for the day. Our educational activity is THE DAY.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
:-) Lexie is so teaching me about life learning.<br/>

HOMESCHOOLING AND GIRL SCOUTING<br/>
Joylyn Fowler<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:joylyn@...">joylyn@...</a><br/>
<br/>
Bio: Four years in Girl Scouts as a girl, three years in GS as an adult, <br/>
with the last two as a leader. I am currently a leader in a multi level <br/>
troop (Brownies and Juniors) with three other leaders. We unschooling <br/>
our two daughters, ages 4 and 8.<br/>
<br/>
Augmentation of a Homeschooling Program through Girl Scouts<br/>
<br/>
Reading: Girls must read in order to complete badges, but the reading <br/>
can go so much further. My girls have had to read to memorize various <br/>
items, including songs, the promise and law, and their parts in <br/>
different plays. We also read the story of Girl Scouts, and Juliet Low, <br/>
the Founder. The girls are also required to read the rules for product <br/>
sales, and of course, the incentives they can earn by selling the <br/>
products. Girls must decide how to spend the money earned by the product <br/>
sales, and in doing so often do research. The older the GS the more <br/>
reading is necessary. We learn to read best by reading those things that <br/>
are important to us, and those things for which we can see practical <br/>
value. Girls usually enjoy scouts and therefore the reading is valuable <br/>
to them. In some cases, the reading might be a bit above their comfort <br/>
level, but because they are motivated to read, reading happens, and <br/>
skills develop.<br/>
<br/>
Writing: There are constant opportunities for writing. The girls in my <br/>
troop have written the following: thank you notes, posters for product <br/>
sales, invitations to various ceremonies, letters for many occasions <br/>
(including one to the President), and more. As the girls get older, GS <br/>
encourages the girls to write notes to people who have purchased <br/>
cookies. Again, as with reading, the writing within GS is usually <br/>
meaningful, practical and useful<br/>
<br/>
Math: The math opportunities are endless. Product sales provide lots of <br/>
opportunities for mathboth in handling money and figuring out how many <br/>
more boxes of cookies you need to sell in order to reach your personal <br/>
goal. Dues are also vital and the youngest of scouts can be responsible <br/>
for paying their own dues. As the girls get older, they take an active <br/>
role in troop finances. They decide how to spend the money, and budget <br/>
the various trips, activities, and service projects as a troop. At the <br/>
Senior level, they actually take over the troop checking account, along <br/>
with their adult advisor. There are math badges at all levels, as well.<br/>
<br/>
Science: There are many science badges, at all levels. The founder of <br/>
girl scouts and the current folks who write GS badges must realize how <br/>
important science (and math) is (are) to girls. Girl Scouts also <br/>
provides a wonderful setting (all girls, nothing but girls) for the <br/>
learning of science (and math). Ecology and the natural environment is <br/>
stressed, as is nutrition, health, hygiene, smoking and drug education, <br/>
and more. The health sciences are covered as well.<br/>
<br/>
History/Social Studies: Social Studies is very much in evident in the <br/>
girl scout program. Girls learn about the history of girl scouts, and <br/>
women. There are badges which address this subject as well.<br/>
<br/>
Physical Education: There are badges at all levels that are geared <br/>
toward physical activities. Girls learn all about basic sports, but the <br/>
GS program goes further, encouraging a great deal of physical <br/>
activities, including horseback riding, boating, camping, skiing, <br/>
swimming, hiking, backpacking, no facilities camping (ie, out door <br/>
toilets), etc. The girls are taught the skills they need in order to <br/>
take on very active roles in the camping experience, doing the majority <br/>
of the cooking, cleaning, setting up of camp, and tearing down <br/>
themselves. Camping is vital to the GS program, although many leaders <br/>
wait until the Junior level to camp. Each girl is encouraged to learn <br/>
self defense including how to avoid dangerous situation and how to <br/>
protect themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Music: No GS program is complete without music. Campfire songs and fun <br/>
songs, songs to sing on car trips to various outings, and songs to sing <br/>
when meetings are opening and meetings are closing, songs from different <br/>
cultures, and songs from the pastGS meetings are not complete without <br/>
the girls singing at least a few songs!<br/>
<br/>
Arts and Crafts: This is my favorite. As a GS leader, I can plan <br/>
wonderful projects for the girls to do that I might not do in my own <br/>
home. We have painted, drawn with markers, crayons, pencils, and more. <br/>
Weve weaved, sewn, tie dyed, t-shirt painting, made mobiles and <br/>
collages, gift baskets and ghosts out of tissue and lollypops. My girls <br/>
have made cards for all occasions, sock puppets, and made presents for <br/>
service projects (the nursing home and the homeless).<br/>
<br/>
Service Projects: Service Projects are a vital part of the GS program. <br/>
Service projects help girls to learn how they, as a single person or a <br/>
group of girls, can have an effect upon this world. My girls have done <br/>
the following projects: feeding the homeless, giving cookies from our <br/>
troop to the homeless, performed at nursing homes and retirement <br/>
communities, made tray decorations for Meals on Wheels, collected food <br/>
for a food bank, collected food, baby items, etc. for a pregnant mom in <br/>
need, collected toys and food and other items for a family in need <br/>
(adopted that family for Christmas), given gifts to various community <br/>
members at appropriate times (new baby, marriage, etc.), picked up trash <br/>
in a park, etc. Service projects can be endless, and should be something <br/>
that is stressed in the GS troop. The older the girls, the more <br/>
intricate the projects can be. Older girls can also be more involved in <br/>
the planning process and implementation.<br/>
<br/>
Responsibility: GS teaches girls to be responsible, because as the girls <br/>
grow older, the take on every increasingly difficult tasks in the <br/>
management of the troop, with the adults being trained to step back and <br/>
become advisors.<br/>
<br/>
Spiritual Training: Girl Scouts are not required to believe in God or a <br/>
higher power, as personal beliefs are not only respected but diversity <br/>
is valued in the program. Girls can omit any part of the GS promise or <br/>
law, as fits their personal belief system. The diverse environment helps <br/>
girls to see that there are many types of folks in this world, and that <br/>
learning to get along with lots of different people and their <br/>
differences, is valuable. Girls promise to be a sister to every scout, <br/>
regardless of race, religion, or any other category.<br/>
<br/>
Patriotism: The GS allows girls, if it does not interfere with her <br/>
personal belief system, to learn to be a good citizen for her country. <br/>
Girl Scouts is in almost all Countries in the world, and the GS <br/>
organization wants each girl to support her own country, and be a good <br/>
citizen for that country. Flag ceremonies, saying of the pledge and <br/>
other forms of patriotism are encouraged but at not time is any girl <br/>
forced to participate in anything that makes her uncomfortably or goes <br/>
against her beliefs. This is good for ALL girls, allowing them to see <br/>
that people can do things a bit differently and still be Girl Scouts.<br/>
<br/>
The S wordSocial Skills: Girl Scouts is a great place for girls to be <br/>
with girls, to make friends, especially with friends who otherwise they <br/>
might not get to meet. We do not allow, in our troop, cliques or <br/>
groupsall the girls work with all the girls. The younger are helped by <br/>
the older, good friends can sometimes work with each other and at other <br/>
times, the girls know they need to learn to get along with and work with <br/>
people who are not their best friend. Our troop is a very supportive <br/>
one, with an environment where the girls are encouraging and loving to <br/>
each other. The social skills learned in a good GS troop are positive <br/>
and valuable.<br/>
<br/>
FUN! This is probably the most important part of the GS program. This is <br/>
a time for girls to come together and be with friends, to sing songs, to <br/>
paint or draw, to complete badges and help our neighbors. As serious as <br/>
I take the GS program, as part of our lives and part of our educational <br/>
plan for our daughters, I never forget that fun is so important. We <br/>
laugh and hug and really love to be with each other, and that is what GS <br/>
is all about!</div>

 </span></blockquote>hi joylyn,<br/>
<br/>
i have a question for you.  i&#39;m not very familiar with the girl scouts <br/>
organization, so i&#39;m not sure if everyone at your conference is either.  (i <br/>
was in a co-ed group called pathfinders as a child & teen, but i suspect <br/>
they are run somewhat differently.)<br/>
<br/>
do girls in scouts get to choose the badges they want to do individually or <br/>
as a troop, or do the adults choose them?  what&#39;s a &quot;math badge&quot;?  do they <br/>
have to do badges?  your music, arts & crafts, and service projects sound <br/>
great. are those activities for badges or &quot;just for fun&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
i realize that the information you gave is the handout & not the talk, but <br/>
i&#39;m not sure how similar the handout & talk are.  if i were just reading <br/>
the handout, i&#39;d want an introductory paragraph about GS in general, and <br/>
how my children could choose to participate, or if they can opt out of <br/>
things that aren&#39;t interesting or meaningful to them.  i realize that <br/>
you&#39;ve probably divided activities into school topics for the benefit of <br/>
the audience, but i&#39;m not sure if GS uses the same categories or not.  the <br/>
&quot;math badges&quot; were one thing that made me question how &#39;schooly&#39; girl <br/>
scouts is.<br/>
<br/>
thanks!<br/>
<br/>
michele<br/>
<br/>
p.s. i&#39;ve sent some nitpicky comments (e.g. about missing punctuation) <br/>
directly to you, but i thought other people might have this question too.</div>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; i have a question for you.  i&#39;m not very familiar with the girl scouts<br/>
&gt; organization, so i&#39;m not sure if everyone at your conference is <br/>
&gt; either.  (i<br/>
&gt; was in a co-ed group called pathfinders as a child & teen, but i suspect<br/>
&gt; they are run somewhat differently.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>OK, I need to write a bit about girl scouts.  I&#39;ll do so.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; do girls in scouts get to choose the badges they want to do <br/>
&gt; individually or<br/>
&gt; as a troop, or do the adults choose them?  what&#39;s a &quot;math badge&quot;?  do <br/>
&gt; they<br/>
&gt; have to do badges?  your music, arts & crafts, and service projects sound<br/>
&gt; great. are those activities for badges or &quot;just for fun&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Both.  The older the girl the more they choose as a troop and <br/>
individually.  At the brownie level the girls are supposed to have a <br/>
say.  The idea is when the girls are young, the leaders help the girls <br/>
start to learn to manage the troop, the girls vote on projects, trips, <br/>
etc.  By the Caddette level, the girls are doing all most everything <br/>
with the adults only advisors.  At the high school level this is even <br/>
more so, the girls actually can sign the checkbook, with an adult <br/>
cosigner, and manage all the funds.  The adults are clearly only advisors.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; i realize that the information you gave is the handout & not the talk, <br/>
&gt; but<br/>
&gt; i&#39;m not sure how similar the handout & talk are.  if i were just reading<br/>
&gt; the handout, i&#39;d want an introductory paragraph about GS in general, and<br/>
&gt; how my children could choose to participate, or if they can opt out of<br/>
&gt; things that aren&#39;t interesting or meaningful to them.  i realize that<br/>
&gt; you&#39;ve probably divided activities into school topics for the benefit of<br/>
&gt; the audience, but i&#39;m not sure if GS uses the same categories or not.  <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &quot;math badges&quot; were one thing that made me question how &#39;schooly&#39; girl<br/>
&gt; scouts is.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Depends on the program.  Some troops are rather schooly, others are not. <br/>
 Mine is not, we do lots of fun things and sometimes &quot;educational&#39; <br/>
activities happen, well, lots of times, but I rarely point it out. <br/>
 Almost all my girls are in school, I have only 4 homeschooled girls in <br/>
my troop, including my own daughter (two other families).  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-596029912">Well, the only problem is, I didn&#39;t really get permission from our <br/>
council to do this... I figured I am a homeschooling mom talking about <br/>
girl scouts, not a girl scout leader talking about homeschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
Also the my service unit person and myself are having difficulties. I&#39;d <br/>
love to talk about this to your partner, do you think she&#39;d be willing? <br/>
 I can call her today on my cell phone, I&#39;d love/need her advice on how <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m printing out your piece for my partner, Joylyn. She works for a GS<br/>
&gt; Council, and constantly hears whining about Girl Scouts and how bad it <br/>
&gt; is. (One<br/>
&gt; theme seems to be adults who boast with pride, &quot;I was kicked out of <br/>
&gt; Girl Scouts!&quot;<br/>
&gt; We suspect their parents pulled them out because they were tired of <br/>
&gt; getting<br/>
&gt; calls about how disruptive they are, then told them they were kicked out.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Beth will appreciate someone talking about the positives for a change.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; While I&#39;m thinking of it, I have a rant. Recently the Philadelphia <br/>
&gt; area Boy<br/>
&gt; Scout council&#39;s board unanimously voted in a non-discrimination policy<br/>
&gt; (including about sexual orientation). A long-time teenage Boy Scout <br/>
&gt; then came out in a<br/>
&gt; newspaper interview...and was kicked out. Sigh...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1676598671">That&#39;s OK. Feel free to use the one I will paste below. It&#39;s the final <br/>
draft.<br/>
<br/>
The talk went pretty well, considering. I was unsure what to wear. As a <br/>
member of LLL and being a chair on the LLL committee I know at those <br/>
conferences I have to wear something fairly nice but I am not a member <br/>
of CHN and this was a homeschooling conference and I am a volunteer <br/>
speaker, I decided to wear my nice jeans. The girls had on their <br/>
matching tie dye long sleeved shirts and so I threw on a tie dye shirt. <br/>
I had just finished Janene hair a few days before, adding purple <br/>
extensions to her braids, it looks absolutely lovely but, I admit now, <br/>
hardly conservative. Lexie still has her two Annie braids, I was going <br/>
to put her blue extentions into her hair but we are visiting my <br/>
grandparents tomorrow and Lexie felt that Janene&#39;s purple hair was <br/>
enough for my grandparents to handle, that they might not be able to <br/>
deal with her having blue braids as well, so she said she&#39;d wait until <br/>
tomorrow night. Anyway, so here we are, in tie dye and purple braids. I <br/>
show up just before the talk starts, Janene is not with me, she has <br/>
found a friend and her baby and went with them for a bit. I do have <br/>
Lexie and Savannah, another homeschooled child who is a girl scout and <br/>
wanted to attend with us. I sit down next to two boy scout women, one of <br/>
which does cub scouts and the other boy scouts. On the other side of me <br/>
is another woman, dressed in red white and blue. In front of me at the <br/>
front table are these little girls that have similar uniforms on, but <br/>
they reminded me of the photos you see of the young hitler youth, lots <br/>
of red white and blue. Flag waving, as my dad calls it. I was <br/>
immediately uncomfortable. I look at the binder the adult has in front <br/>
of her and it has on it the words &quot;American Heritage Girls&quot; (go to <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ahgonline.org/">http://www.ahgonline.org/</a> to see about this organization) I have no idea <br/>
who she is, I&#39;ve never heard of this organization but I figure, what the <br/>
hell.. I&#39;m here. I had decided on my way in that I was going to <br/>
introduce myself not as a representative of girl scouts, but instead as <br/>
a homeschooler who happens to be a girl scout leader, with the idea that <br/>
I am talking about how girl scouts fits into our homeschool life.<br/>
<br/>
So now we begin. The moderator is one of the speakers, she introduces us <br/>
all and as she is doing this I see a cockroach about 6 inches from her <br/>
on her notebook. I quietly point it out to her thinking if it gets on <br/>
her without her knowledge that would be worse, but she was pretty <br/>
freaked out by it and I finally got a napkin and snatched the poor <br/>
thing, all the while making light of it. Did I say this session was <br/>
being taped? I said something about how I hoped it hadn&#39;t escaped from <br/>
the hands on bug workshop. I had to leave the room to throw it away. I <br/>
did find it interesting that I was the only one who was OK with taking <br/>
care of the bug issue calmly. hmmm<br/>
<br/>
So then it&#39;s the lovely lady who is with the Amican Heritage Girls time <br/>
to speak. She announces that her program was begun because there were a <br/>
great deal of Christains who believed that girl scouts were moving away <br/>
from core values they wanted to teach their children. I&#39;m thinking, &quot;oh <br/>
great.&quot; She introduces her little uniformed clad children and I&#39;m <br/>
looking at Lexie in her tie dye, thinking that this year&#39;s uniform for <br/>
many of my girl scout girls are tie dye shirts we made as a troop!<br/>
<br/>
I introduce myself and basically sorta read my bio and introduction <br/>
which is on my sheet... below. I do say that girl scouts is for girls <br/>
ages 5 to 18, that men can be and are girl scouts, that it&#39;s where <br/>
&quot;girls grow strong&quot;, etc. And I say, almost word for word, the <br/>
following: . It is a place where they can learn to be strong women; <br/>
where they can learn to be leaders. GS do not, by policy, discriminate <br/>
for ANY reason, including sexual orientation or how a girl or her family <br/>
might believe. The GS program is flexible, so all girls, regardless of <br/>
personal belief systems or lifestyle, can join and benefit. The only <br/>
people who are barred membership are boys.&quot; Ok, got that out of the way...<br/>
<br/>
Then we take questions. At about this time, my friend brings back <br/>
Janene, who joins me at the podium. As we all are fielding questions, <br/>
Janene gets out paper and pencil and is drawing under the table, which <br/>
as a long table cloth on it. Every so often she pops up between my knees <br/>
and asks me a question or gets a grape out of the bag Janene is not a <br/>
quiet sit in a chair and not move child, but she&#39;s doing pretty good, in <br/>
my view. I&#39;m sure others might think differently. A bit later my friend <br/>
Andy comes in, she&#39;s Savannah&#39;s mom. She sits down, but not next to <br/>
Savannah as there are no chairs there. During all this time as I am <br/>
talking, to answer a question or whatever, Savvy or Lexie will indicate <br/>
to me that they have something to add and I let them do so. The hitler <br/>
lady&#39;s children didn&#39;t say a word or even act animated. The time is <br/>
almost gone and I&#39;m thinking to myself--good job joylyn, you have gotten <br/>
through this without addressing the homosexual or athiest issue, beyond <br/>
your initial strong statement, this is about homeschooling, not your <br/>
personal feelings....and then my good friend Andy pipes up--&quot;Do you know <br/>
anything about Circle Scouts&quot; knowning damn well that I do know about it <br/>
and where it will lead. At dinner later she told me she just had to do <br/>
that. She says this with a big grin, she&#39;s a UU and a bit of a <br/>
troublemaker, in such a good way, I like her so! So I talked about them <br/>
for a bit, as an alternative. Someone asked why we would need an <br/>
alternative and I said &quot;The boy scouts actively discriminate against <br/>
boys and adults who do not believe in a higher power and those who are <br/>
gay.&quot; Of course, this started something. One paramilitary man, obviously <br/>
a die hard boy scout, brought up the issue up north with the boy who was <br/>
kicked out because he would not say he believed in any higher power and <br/>
tried to make the point that boy scouts had tried everything to give him <br/>
and out but he refused to take it (ie, he didn&#39;t ahve to say he believed <br/>
in a GOD but he did have to say he believed in something as his higher <br/>
power. The young man refused.) I clarified that I personally thought <br/>
that young man was quite brave and strong as he stood up against <br/>
powerful adults and stuck up for his personal belief system and I found <br/>
that trait to be quite admirable. Not what the man wanted me to say. One <br/>
woman said &quot;so what do we do if we have boys and want them involved in <br/>
an organization like boy scouts&quot; I said that I thougth boy scouts was a <br/>
good organization that did a lot of good for boys but that I personally <br/>
could not belong to or allow my children to belong to an organization <br/>
that actively discriminates against others for any reason, but that <br/>
every person needed to look into their own hearts, and examine their own <br/>
belief system and decide for themselves what was best for their family. <br/>
That was really how the talk ended.<br/>
<br/>
I had a lot of people nodding and smiling at me and quite a few said <br/>
after that I was an excellent speaker and quite articulate, which is <br/>
funny because I often think I&#39;m a bumbling idiot, as things sometimes <br/>
don&#39;t come out as I wish them to or as I hear them in my head. One woman <br/>
talked further--her son IS in boy scouts and she had NO idea there were <br/>
these issues, so we talked for a bit, and then invited her to email me <br/>
further. It was an interesting session. I&#39;m adding later, that there <br/>
were also quite a few who were obviously, as Andy put it, die hard boy <br/>
scouts who were likely homophobic and that was one big reason they liked <br/>
the boy scouts, keep their sons away from those that would make them <br/>
gay. But most were somewhere in between, and I know I made a few people <br/>
think.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling did come up. Someone asked about how he had heard that some <br/>
people use scouts as their ENTIRE schooling program. The boy scouts and <br/>
cub scout people addressed that and then I said something like &quot;I&#39;m not <br/>
sure why someone would want to do that, as an unschooler we are learning <br/>
all the time, every day, in all parts of our lives, ang girl scouts just <br/>
adds to that, but I can also see that someone could take the girl scout <br/>
program and use it completely in homeschooling and that it would be a <br/>
very well rounded program.&quot; He then asked how a girl could learn math <br/>
through the program and Savvy answered this, she talked about the math <br/>
badges, and such. I then added the bit about product sales, and that in <br/>
my opinion just living in our world today and being a part of daily life <br/>
teaches my girls math that is meaningful to them. I also talked about <br/>
how the older girls manage their troop checkbooks and that I couldn&#39;t <br/>
wait for that time period because then Lexie could also take over my own <br/>
checkbook and maybe it would actually balance. Unschooling is so hard <br/>
for people to get and I just dont&#39; understand why.... And of course, one <br/>
woman I spoke with later said that of course it works NOW because my <br/>
kids are so young but by the time they were in middle school I would <br/>
have to do text books and worksheets with them, right? Uh, no...<br/>
<br/>
Andy and I had dinner, with a few other people, and Andy said it was <br/>
most amusing, to see me sitting between these obviously different folks, <br/>
me in my tie dye while they were wearing their uniforms or more proper <br/>
clothing, with Janene and her purple braids popping up every so often.<br/>
<br/>
so there you have it.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the final product, I&#39;m sure there are errors in it as well, but <br/>
this time I don&#39;t wish to know about them. :-) Sandra, feel free to edit <br/>
them out. Also, I can send you privately the document in word with <br/>
formatting... just let me know.<br/>

HOMESCHOOLING AND GIRL SCOUTING<br/>
Joylyn Fowler<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:joylyn@...">joylyn@...</a><br/>
<br/>
Bio: I spent four years in Girl Scouts as a girl, three years in GS as <br/>
an adult, with the last two as a leader. I am currently a leader in a <br/>
multi-level troop (Brownies and Juniors) with three other leaders. My <br/>
husband and I are unschooling our two daughters, ages 4 and 8.<br/>
<br/>
What is Girl Scouts: These are my own words; these are not taken from <br/>
the Girl Scout Website or Literature. Girl Scouts--�Where Girls Grow <br/>
Strong.� GS is a program that allows girls to be in an all girl <br/>
environment (with exception of helpful daddies and other adult men, and <br/>
male siblings) In GS, girls are loved for themselves. It is a place <br/>
where they can learn to be strong women; where they can learn to be <br/>
leaders. GS do not, by policy, discriminate for ANY reason, including <br/>
sexual orientation or how a girl or her family might believe. The GS <br/>
program is flexible, so all girls, regardless of personal belief systems <br/>
or lifestyle, can join and benefit. The only people who are barred <br/>
membership are boys�adult men can and are GS. GS is an all inclusive <br/>
environment where our girls can learn and grow and be the best they can <br/>
be, learning to get along with others and helping their communities.<br/>
<br/>
Augmentation of a Homeschooling Program through Girl Scouts<br/>
<br/>
Reading: Girls must read in order to complete badges, but the reading <br/>
can go so much further. My girls have had to read to memorize various <br/>
items, including songs, the promise and law, and their parts in <br/>
different plays. We also read the story of Girl Scouts, and founder, <br/>
Juliette Low. The girls are also required to read the rules for product <br/>
sales, and, of course, the incentives they can earn by selling the <br/>
products. Girls must decide how to spend the money earned by the product <br/>
sales, and, in doing so, often do research on their various options. The <br/>
older the GS, the more reading is necessary. We learn to read best by <br/>
reading those things that are important to us, and those things for <br/>
which we can see practical value. Girls usually enjoy scouts; and <br/>
therefore the reading is valuable to them. In some cases, the reading <br/>
might be a bit above their comfort level, but because they are motivated <br/>
to read, reading happens, and skills develop.<br/>
<br/>
Writing: There are constant opportunities for writing. The girls in my <br/>
troop have written the following: thank you notes, posters for product <br/>
sales, invitations to various ceremonies, letters for many occasions <br/>
(including one to the President), and more. As the girls get older, GS <br/>
encourages the girls to write notes to people who have purchased <br/>
cookies. Again, as with reading, the writing within GS is usually <br/>
meaningful, practical and useful<br/>
<br/>
Math: The math opportunities are endless. Product sales provide lots of <br/>
opportunities for math�both in handling money and figuring out how many <br/>
more boxes a girl needs to sell in order to reach your personal goal. <br/>
Dues are also vital and the even the youngest of scouts can be <br/>
responsible for paying her own dues. As the girls get older, they take <br/>
an active role in troop finances. They decide how to spend the money, <br/>
and budget the various trips, activities, and service projects as a <br/>
troop. At the Senior level, they actually take over the troop checking <br/>
account, along with their adult advisor. There are math badges at all <br/>
levels, as well.<br/>
<br/>
Science: There are many science badges, at all levels. The founder of <br/>
girl scouts and the current folks who write GS badges must realize how <br/>
important science is to girls. Girl Scouts also provides a wonderful <br/>
setting (all girls, nothing but girls) for the learning of science and <br/>
math. Ecology and the natural environment are stressed, as is nutrition, <br/>
health, hygiene, smoking and drug education, and more.<br/>
<br/>
History/Social Studies: Social Studies is very much in evidence in the <br/>
girl scout program. Girls learn about the history of GS, and women. <br/>
There are badges which address this subject as well.<br/>
<br/>
Physical Education: There are badges at all levels that are geared <br/>
toward physical activities. Girls learn all about basic sports, but the <br/>
GS program goes further, encouraging a great deal of physical <br/>
activities, including horseback riding, boating, camping, skiing, <br/>
swimming, hiking, backpacking, no facilities camping (i.e., outdoor <br/>
toilets), etc. The girls are taught the skills they need in order to <br/>
take on very active roles in the camping experience, by doing the <br/>
majority of the cooking, cleaning, setting up of camp, and tearing down <br/>
the camp themselves. Although many leaders wait until the Junior level <br/>
to camp, camping is vital to the GS program. Each girl is encouraged to <br/>
learn self defense including how to avoid dangerous situations and how <br/>
to protect herself.<br/>
<br/>
Music: No GS program is complete without music. Campfire songs and fun <br/>
songs, songs to sing on car trips to various outings, and songs to sing <br/>
when meetings are opening and closing, songs from different cultures, <br/>
and songs from the past�GS meetings are not complete without the girls <br/>
singing at least a few songs!<br/>
<br/>
Arts and Crafts: This is my favorite. As a GS leader, I can plan <br/>
wonderful projects for the girls to do that I might not do in my own <br/>
home. We have painted, drawn with markers, crayons, pencils, and more. <br/>
We�ve weaved, sewn, tie dyed, painted t-shirt, made mobiles and <br/>
collages, gift baskets and ghosts out of tissue and lollypops. My girls <br/>
have made cards for all occasions, sock puppets, and made presents for <br/>
service projects (the nursing home and the homeless).<br/>
<br/>
Service Projects: Service Projects are a vital part of the GS program. <br/>
Service projects help a girl to learn how she, as a single person or a <br/>
group, can have an effect upon this world. My girls have done the <br/>
following projects: fed the homeless, performed at nursing homes and <br/>
retirement communities, made tray decorations for Meals on Wheels, <br/>
collected food for a food bank, collected food, baby items, etc. for a <br/>
pregnant mom in need, adopted a family for Christmas (collected toys and <br/>
food and other items for a family in need), given gifts to various <br/>
community members at appropriate times (new baby, marriage, etc.), and <br/>
picked up trash in a park. Service projects can be endless and should be <br/>
stressed in the GS troop. The older the girls, the more intricate the <br/>
projects can be. Older girls can also be more involved in the planning <br/>
process and implementation.<br/>
<br/>
Responsibility: In GS, girls learn responsibility: as they grow older <br/>
they take on increasingly difficult tasks in the management of the <br/>
troop, while the adults step back and become advisors.<br/>
<br/>
Spiritual Training: Girl Scouts are not required to believe in God or a <br/>
higher power, as personal beliefs are not only respected but diversity <br/>
is valued in the program. A girl can omit any part of the GS promise or <br/>
law, as fits her personal belief system. The diverse environment helps <br/>
girls to see that there are many types of folks in this world and that <br/>
learning to get along with lots of different people and their <br/>
differences is valuable. A girl promises to be a sister to every scout, <br/>
regardless of race, religion, or any other category.<br/>
<br/>
Patriotism: The GS allows a girl, if it does not interfere with her <br/>
personal belief system, to learn to be a good citizen for her country. <br/>
Girl Scouts is in almost every country in the world, and the GS <br/>
organization wants each girl to support her own country and be a good <br/>
citizen for that country. Flag ceremonies, reciting the pledge and other <br/>
forms of patriotism are encouraged but at no time is any girl forced to <br/>
participate in anything that makes her uncomfortable or goes against her <br/>
beliefs. This is good for ALL girls, allowing them to see that people <br/>
can do things a bit differently and still be Girl Scouts.<br/>
<br/>
The �S� Word�Social Skills: Girl Scouts is a great place for girls to be <br/>
with girls, to make friends, especially with girls whom otherwise they <br/>
might not get to meet. We do not allow, in our troop, cliques or <br/>
groups�each girl works with all the girls. The older girls help the <br/>
younger, and they all try to get along�despite differences. Our troop is <br/>
very supportive, with an environment where the girls are encouraging and <br/>
loving to each other. The social skills learned in a good GS troop are <br/>
positive and valuable.<br/>
<br/>
Field Trips: We have gone on a number of field trips, including Sea <br/>
World, San Diego Wild Animal Park, the musicals Cats and Seussical, our <br/>
year end trip at the local water park, Palm Springs and tram, an apple <br/>
farm to pick apples, museums, the Discovery Science Center, and more. <br/>
The list is of possible field trips is endless.<br/>
<br/>
FUN! This is probably the most important part of the GS program. This is <br/>
a time for girls to come together and be with friends, to sing songs, to <br/>
engage in arts & crafts, to complete a badge and to help our neighbors. <br/>
As seriously as I take the GS program, as part of our lives and part of <br/>
our educational plan for our daughters, I never forget that fun is so <br/>
important. We laugh and hug and really love to be with each other, and <br/>
that is what GS is all about!<br/>
