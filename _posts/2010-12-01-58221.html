<div id="ygrps-yiv-1949301281">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Still slowly getting my feet wet with unschooling. Still have hang ups <br/>
on sugar and video/internet watching with my 4 and 2 year old.  But we <br/>
are seriously loving watching old Voyager epiisodes of star trek.  I <br/>
read the books at bedtime to my 4 year old.  Anyway, up until now my <br/>
wife and I have been engaging in the whole santa thing.  And I am ready <br/>
to give that up and share with her the truth.  I am trying to find the <br/>
best way but realize that some damage to trust and a sense of magic in <br/>
the world might be lost.  Anyone go through this?  Any first hand <br/>
experience on what worked and what didn&#39;t?  Thanks Sandra for the posts <br/>
in the past on sugar and videos...still reading through.  Hope to get <br/>
myself on board fully.<br/>

We &quot;did Santa&quot; but we didn&#39;t lie.<br/>
I would tell the kids to put stockings up, because I always did when I was a kid, and in the morning there were gifts.<br/>
<br/>
When asked if I believed Santa was real, I said I had never seen him, if that&#39;s what the question was, but what I did know was if people put out stockings, there would be stuff in them in the morning.  And that was true.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My 9 year old has always known that her dad is Santa. She is big on wanting to know facts and isn&#39;t really into magic and fantasy. My younger girls (2 & 4) don&#39;t really seem to care as long as they get presents. Whenever Santa discussions come up with my 6 year old, she says that he is real and expresses that she doesn&#39;t want anybody to say otherwise. I am pretty sure that she knows the truth but she has always loved to use her imagination and doesn&#39;t like anybody to interfere with her fantasy world. As a result, we don&#39;t do anything to destroy her belief in Santa. Every child is different. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1632518998">My kids have all believed in Santa Claus. My now 9 year old has always been dubious about it and even at 3 and 4 asked alot of questions about but how would he do this or that.  We never lied to him, always made a game out of it.  Always talked about how fun it is to believe in him etc..  I honestly thinking he has always been on the fence about it but this year when he turned 9 he said to me, &quot; I am nine now mom, I think it is time I know about Santa Claus, are you and daddy the ones that give us the presents?&quot; and I said yes.  And then we had a discussion about how the other kids (7, 7 and 5) still like to believe in him and how we can have fun with it.  My almost 8 year old, told me that he still believes in Santa, he loves to imagine things, he has a great imagination and likes fantasy and magic.  I never felt betrayed or lied to as a kid about Santa.  My parents treated it all much the same way we have.  We had fun with it all.  When I asked my mother about him, I think she was surprised I still believed in Santa.  I was about 9 too I think.  We just talked about how fun things like that are.  <br/>
I never really believed in the Easter Bunny, not sure that my kids ever have either... just a little too wierd for me.  Big Bunny in a suit dropping eggs.  But we have always had fun with that too.  Spend days before Easter as a child planning the traps we were going to set for him.</div>

<br/>
I wonder what you think is the benefit of telling your 4 year old &quot;the truth&quot;? <br/>
Also, do you not think that your 4 year old will then tell your 2 year old, for <br/>
whom Santa is pretty brand new and likely a wonderful, maybe a little <br/>
frightening and mysterious idea? Why are *you* ready to &quot;give that up&quot;? Is it <br/>
the notion that &quot;the truth&quot; is more important, more valuable than the myth? Do <br/>
you think that your 4 year old even really *knows* the difference at this point <br/>
in her development/life?<br/>
<br/>
I remember being around 9 years old when my dad told me that Santa Claus was not <br/>
an *actual* person who gave us presents. I had had a feeling at that point that <br/>
something about Santa Claus delivering toys to ALL the kids in the world on one <br/>
night was a bit far fetched, but I was not ready to *believe* my dad that Santa <br/>
was not real. In fact, I recall being in my early 20s, visiting my family home <br/>
while on break from university, and snuggling in bed with my sister (who was in <br/>
her late teens) on Christmas Eve. We both, to this day, will tell you that we <br/>
heard hooves on the roof... the magic of Santa was/is that real for us despite <br/>
&quot;the truth&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, my 4 year old dd and I watched &quot;The History of Christmas&quot; last month, <br/>
and Santa Claus is explored thoroughly, from real man to magical character/myth. <br/>
So, if you intend to tell her &quot;the truth&quot;, you may want to explore this history/ <br/>
version as well.<br/>

<br/>
I would like to add, especially after Sandra&#39;s post on this, that I don&#39;t think <br/>
that upholding a myth is not telling the truth/lying. If your 4yo (or any <br/>
child/person for that matter) is *asking* to know about or understand something <br/>
better, then I think that is a parent&#39;s cue to find an explanation that is more <br/>
in line with &quot;the truth&quot;. However, if said child/person seems to value the myth <br/>
or story as it is, why not be open to exploring *that* with them? All myths and <br/>
stories have elements of &quot;truth&quot; anyhow. But then again, I suppose that this <br/>
discussion could also be about &quot;facts&quot; versus &quot;truth&quot; as they are different.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One of my friends has a son who just this WEEK figured out that Santa <br/>
wasn&#39;t real.  He is furious. He seems to be embarrassed and feels <br/>
ashamed and duped. Not good.<br/>
<br/>
My niece was terrified of Santa coming into their house during the <br/>
night. My sister took her kids&#39; presents from Santa to Grandma&#39;s house <br/>
and they went there in the morning to find what Santa had left them. My <br/>
niece was so worried he&#39;d come into their house on Christmas Eve that <br/>
she would go around and check all the doors and windows (no fireplace).<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid and started to get the feeling something was being <br/>
pulled over on me, I was embarrassed. It felt like a big huge practical <br/>
joke was being played on me and I didn&#39;t like it at all. I still don&#39;t <br/>
like practical jokes. Once I got to the point that I really knew my <br/>
parents were Santa Claus, it was a lot more fun for me to engage in all <br/>
the imaginative stuff, without the tension of not understanding.<br/>
<br/>
That said - I would treat the whole thing as a big happy imaginative <br/>
pretend game.  I wouldn&#39;t sit a 4 yo down and tell her anything - but <br/>
just treat it as a fun pretend thing. I wouldn&#39;t lie, though, at all. If <br/>
they asked, &quot;Who really brings the presents on Christmas?&quot; I might say, <br/>
&quot;Well, how about let&#39;s just say Santa,&quot; but I&#39;d do it with a smile and <br/>
maybe a wink.  If my kids asked really direct and pointed questions, I&#39;d <br/>
say, &quot;Do you want just the facts or the fun playing-pretend version?&quot;<br/>

On the other end of it, my 8 year old son never really accepted the Santa story as true, but plays along in his own way. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also told some kids (we have five, now ages 3 - 13) that Santa is as &quot;real&quot; as Mickey Mouse, or Blue&#39;s Clues (or whatever other character) - and we have traveled thousands of miles to theme parks to visit them, so that&#39;s real enough for them! :-) <br/>

<br/>
As advice to others, I think this is dangerous thinking.<br/>
I can&#39;t change the fact that that&#39;s what you said to your child. :-)<br/>
Perhaps, though, I could caution others about making statements about what other people believe to be true (there&#39;s quite a range of belief and presentation, when it comes to Santa Claus), and ESPECIALLY against assuming one knows what a child wants to believe.<br/>
<br/>
There are usually more than two options in any case.  <br/>
<br/>
One could fairly and safely say &quot;different people believe different things.&quot;  And &quot;Like what?&quot; could have three or four versions.<br/>
<br/>
No child needs ALL the details of anything--not of where babies come from, or what was WWII about, or is Santa Claus real.<br/>
There&#39;s a lot of unschooling fodder in the idea of how much to tell children when they ask a question.  And there are morality and integrity issues to examine when parents decide how they will present information.<br/>
<br/>
Recently I was talking to a mom who was not religious but who had religious parents/inlaws, and she wanted to know how to advise a child to act around religious situations.   The mom was confusion belief and behavior.  I don&#39;t have to believe in all the mysterious juju/glory of  New Mexico-style Roman Catholicism in order to behave myself at a midnight mass.  I know how to be respectful of other people&#39;s experiences and expectations.   That&#39;s something people should consider around winter holidays and all kinds of religious and cultural beliefs, expectations and behaviors.<br/>
<br/>
The choice is not &quot;lie&quot; or &quot;tell everything you know.&quot;  The best choices might be in the range of keep it fun and sweet and happy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-140513283">My parents never did the Santa thing with me as a child, I was aware of him of course as a story and I used to do things like write letters to him and leave out mince pies sometimes... But I never felt it was less than magical for my patents to sneak in and leave a stocking full of presents in my room while I slept.  I much preferred that to the idea of a stranger sneaking in (but that won&#39;t be true of all children of course). <br/>
<br/>
For me, because of my own childhood, it would have felt very odd to talk about Santa as more real than (say) the Power Rangers or any of the other characters who fill our days... And I have seen parents go too far (or what seems to me too far) by outright lying to children who are old enough to be asking for the truth.<br/>
<br/>
But, having said that, I think it comes down more to the parents and what they feel makes Christmas Christmas, as long as they are focussed on their real child rather than trying to promote an abstract idea of &#39;childhood magic&#39;.<br/>

And for us Santa and many of the other celebrations/characters around this season represent a spirit of giving and that is what we celebrate around here --from Saint Nicholas on December 6th to Santa Lucia on the 13th to Solstice, etc, it goes on an on. This is a special time for us to reinforce our trust that although the snow is covering up our beautiful gardens and woods --we need to believe that the sun and the warmth will return and with that the spring and our flowers will come back!<br/>
<br/>
I am almost 40 year old, I still believe deeply in the spirit of Santa and I have never seen him, but I believe in the spirit he brings out in so many people --his spirit lives in me as it did in my parent and my grandparents and in my daughters --who have their own sweet beliefs in this season! <br/>
<br/>
I love learning what each of you do --ahh the magic of unschooling!<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Hi, I feel like most other things, kids will figure out the &quot;truth&quot; about<br/>
&gt; Santa and Easter Bunny. Why this hurry in demystifying the magical creatures<br/>
&gt; and figures? Enjoy and have fun. We in India also let kids imagine that<br/>
&gt; Santa brings them gifts on Chritsmas Eve. In New Delhi there is added<br/>
&gt; advantage of it being really cold and foggy the<br/>
&gt;  whole festive season. Some of us head to the hills not far from Delhi in<br/>
&gt; the Himalayas to even catch snow!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Let them figure out in their own time the truth about elves, fairies,<br/>
&gt; centaurs, dragons and the world of Tolkien and Harry Potter!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Season&#39;s greetings!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-514395060">My extremely literal minded (usually) 8 year old loves Christmas, but for years has had doubts about Santa. I have not lied to him and yet he has hung on to it, never actually asking outright. He always tracks Santa&#39;s progress here - <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.noradsanta.org/en/index.html">http://www.noradsanta.org/en/index.html</a> - and always asks how it&#39;s possible but in such a way that makes it clear he&#39;s speculating rather than asking for the truth. This year he told my mum that he&#39;s going to find out by looking to see if DH and I are cranky on Christmas Day so he can know if we got up in the night (he goes to bed with us so knows we don&#39;t do it then). My mum again probed to see if he wanted to know the truth (she and I have discussed our approach) but he was quite clear in the conversation that he didn&#39;t. I think for him he does really know but is enjoying the thrill of the chase, or the conversational dance around all this. In general he doesn&#39;t have a vivid fantasy life and I think this is something where he enjoys the larger than life side of it.<br/>

I do not believe this is incompatible with unschooling.<br/>

represented by the Santa Ideal is really special. I hold that generosity as<br/>
a sacred part of the Holidays.<br/>
Maybe just a change in vocabulary will ease the inevitable future<br/>

Santa gifts, as use &quot;The Spirit of Easter&#39;s Bunny&quot; for that Holiday :D<br/>

Last year, my then-8-year-old daughter asked me while we were in the car alone, &quot;Mom, do you believe in Santa Claus?&quot;  I really wasn&#39;t sure what answer she was hoping for, and I didn&#39;t want to lie OR potentially spoil all her fun.  Luckily we watch a lot of Christmas videos each year.  So I just snorted and said, &quot;No, of course not!&quot;  When she looked surprised and a little disappointed I said, &quot;As you know from all the movies we watch, Santa Claus is just really for kids.  The parents never actually believe.&quot;  Then she pointed out that in those movies there really is a Santa Claus, and made some arguements why Dad couldn&#39;t be the one putting presents under the tree.  When I finally said, &quot;I guess I can see your point...&quot; she said &quot;Yay!&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When my first daughter was born and for her first four xmas&#39;s we put out presents and she thought Santa put them out.  We left sparkles and oats outside so the reindeer could find our house (she made this mixture at a craft time) and a note and cookies and hot tea for Santa and carrots for the reindeer.  She was happy and seemed to enjoy the experiences.  <br/>
<br/>
Over time though I began questioning how it felt to me to continue doing this without explaining it all honestly.  After our second son was born, I told my dh that I didn&#39;t feel comfortable keeping the truth from our kids.  Although dh thought it would have been fine to keep going along with the kids still believing in Santa, he went along with what I wished and I did begin talking honestly with them about Santa. Wish I recalled if our first child asked about whether Santa was real or if I brought it up...I just can&#39;t remember.  We still took family pics with Santa for the fun of it, sent out some cards, decorated, cut down our own tree at a local tree farm, went on drives to see the most decorated houses, exchanged gifts, put out surprise gifts for the kids, went to parades, and stuffed the stockings and did other things that were fun for  and lightings, this time of year.  It was still fun and I felt better about being honest!  <br/>
<br/>
Our third child was VERY uncomfortable with strangers, heck, even people we knew.  There was no way she&#39;d even want to sit with a big fellow in a red suit for a picture whether she knew him to be real or not.  But it was okay if I held her in a family picture.  <br/>
<br/>
Somehow my husband and her got this thing going where he&#39;d tell her that HE was Santa Claus - that was his excuse for putting on weight!  And when we were at a zoo, he&#39;d say that he was checking in on his reindeer.  She&#39;d ask me if it was Really true and I&#39;d be honest and say that it was not true and that Daddy is just joking.  He admits he is joking if either of us ask him to be honest, but I think he prefers to be vague.  I am more serious and dh is more of a joker...the ying and the yang...      <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1538626445">This is a timely topic for me, because my 9yo daughter recently (~6 weeks<br/>
ago) lost a tooth and left it - and a note - for the Tooth Fairy.  In the<br/>
note, my daughter asked the TF to please bring her a pair of wings...and<br/>
when my daughter did not receive the wings the next morning, she was<br/>
devastated.  I pointed out that such a thing just is not possible - that if<br/>
it were, we&#39;d likely see people flying around quite often, and surely wings<br/>
could be bought in stores (or at least on amazon!).  Although she understood<br/>
the logic, it still did not assuage the hurt she felt that she was not going<br/>
to receive wings and that...there was, apparently, no TF.  Why she thought<br/>
that the TF could bring her wings, I don&#39;t know, but from there, it lead to<br/>
her asking about whether there was really a Santa and an Easter Bunny.  And<br/>
leprechauns.  I am an imperfect parent - I admitted that they all had<br/>
parental assistance, except for the leprechauns, because there was just no<br/>
way I&#39;d willingly destroy my house like that each St. Patty&#39;s Day.  I shared<br/>
with her the famed editorial letter from years ago, &quot;Yes, Virginia, there is<br/>
a Santa Claus&quot; which did nothing but make her even sadder.  I shared<br/>
something else with her about the spirit of Christmas as well as the story<br/>
of Saint Nicholas, and again, none of helped to ease her heartache...but<br/>
mostly, it was that she couldn&#39;t get wings.<br/>
<br/>
The thing is, she&#39;s a very sensitive little girl - very artistic, with an<br/>
old soul - she worries about the bad things that happen in the world, about<br/>
the future which might not be good, and while discussing with my friend, we<br/>
concluded that my daughter really *needs* something that helps her remember<br/>
there is still magic and purpose and joy in the world.  I asked her why she<br/>
wanted wings, and she said that she wanted to &quot;get away from it all&quot; and<br/>
that she feels stressed out about worrying about her future and about money<br/>
(even though there is no reason for her to worry about money, but her<br/>
friend&#39;s family has had a rather rough go of things) and things like that.<br/>
<br/>
Would it all have been better if she hadn&#39;t believed all along?  Well,<br/>
that&#39;s the thing - at ages 4 and 5, she was resolute in her conviction that<br/>
Santa wasn&#39;t real, even though we fully played up the excitement.  And now,<br/>
although she *knows* the truth, she still asks me, &quot;Are you SURE there isn&#39;t<br/>
a real Santa?&quot;  And my answer for her now is that, without reservation, I<br/>
believe in him, even if he isn&#39;t personally the one delivering the gifts.  I<br/>
am fairly certain that she *knows* the answer, but based on how and when she<br/>
asks, I think she needs to hear that I believe.<br/>
<br/>
When I was 4, my family lived on a military base in Hawaii and, on Christmas<br/>
Eve, there flew over the residential area of the base a sleigh of sorts,<br/>
with jingling bells and a loud &quot;Ho, ho, ho!&quot; and, from what I remember, a<br/>
red light out in front.  Now, it *could* have been a rather elaborately<br/>
decked out helicopter...but nearly 40 years later, I&#39;d just rather not think<br/>
about it like that.  It is one of my earliest memories, and one of the most<br/>
exciting and magical things I&#39;ve remembered from that time.  And if the<br/>
military could do then what NORAD does now, tracking Santa, then there&#39;s a<br/>
whole lot of something that&#39;s just wonderful about the spirit of the season.<br/>

We did a similar thing.  We never really played up the Santa thing but when my <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1030280915">We&#39;re Jewish, so no Santa Claus issues have arisen here (although Christmas trees are being very noticed this year).  But, we&#39;ve encountered a similar incident with the tooth fairy.  Temima, 4 years old, had a tooth pulled out, and they gave her a little box to put the tooth in and talked up the tooth fairy.  So I played along with it... and later in the day she began questioning me about the tooth fairy and what was really going to happen and all, and so I said all the make-believe things... but with that tone of voice, like playfully, wink wink, etc.  And she still sort of wasn&#39;t sure... but she might have been happy with that... but later on she asked me if really I was going to leave the money under her pillow, and I sort of leaned in and whispered secretively into her ear that, yes, I was the tooth fairy.  She loved that.  But she still wasn&#39;t sure, and asked me a few more times.  I think we fairly well established how fun it is to pretend, and that its okay to believe, and its also okay to explore doubts. <br/>
<br/>
What I liked about what I did, and it feel very unschoolish to me, was leaving the way open for her to believe at each &#39;level&#39; of questioning, letting it just end there, but also giving more information as she asked for it.  It seemed to satisfy her.<br/>
<br/>
And now we&#39;re starting to encounter a bit more questions about anatomy, babies, what pads are for, etc... and its going the same route, snippets of information, just enough to satisfy her curiosity, and then as soon as there is an interruption of some sort (like the baby!) she lets it go for a while.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1931947960">I&#39;m with Sandra on the variations of &quot;in-between&quot;.  The only trouble I&#39;ve have ever had about Santa is feeling like I&#39;m lying to my kids.  So to remedy that, I just don&#39;t go crazy and make up all these stories and make them sit on &quot;his&quot; lap at the mall. <br/>
<br/>
I just sort of let it be.  We always had &quot;Santa&quot; growing up, and I remember it as being fun.  I don&#39;t remember when I figured out he wasn&#39;t real, but even when I did we still had fun with it.  <br/>
<br/>
So this year my youngest (6 y/o, very matter of fact type, who asks a million direct questions about everything) said &quot;Taylor (a friend of both my boys) told us Santa wasn&#39;t real, that it&#39;s just your parents&quot;.  And I said, &quot;what do you think?&quot; and he sort of told me that he thought it was us.  I just smiled and honestly I can&#39;t remember exactly what else I said, but it wasn&#39;t &quot;oh yes, he&#39;s real&quot; and it wasn&#39;t &quot;Taylor&#39;s right, it&#39;s us&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
A day or so later my son said &quot;you know, I think Santa is real&quot;.  And I (a little surprised based on what he had said previously) said &quot;why do you say that?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And he said &quot;Because you guys could never afford all the stuff we get!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Let the magic continue as long as it&#39;s fun. You don&#39;t have to force it and &quot;lie&quot;, but you don&#39;t have to force the &quot;truth&quot; either. <br/>

<br/>
When I was four or five, my mom took me to a store Santa (department store; pre-mall days, 1950&#39;s).  A few stores down, there was another one.  Different one.   And I had already mentioned to my mom that the first guy&#39;s beard wasn&#39;t real.   She quite calmly said that Santa couldn&#39;t really sit in every store, and that these guys were helpers, who got the information about what the kids wanted for Christmas.  We talked about younger kids who didn&#39;t know about fake beards thinking it was the real Santa and feeling good about that.<br/>
<br/>
I had told him I wanted a two-story dollhouse, and that&#39;s what I got.  What I didn&#39;t realize for MANY years, even after I knew Santa was a big hoax (as I thought right at first, when I found out) was that the parents were hearing the request, and that was the good part.<br/>
<br/>
So even after I knew the store Santa&#39;s were just guys dressed up like Santa, I still thought for another few years that there was an original real Santa somewhere, busy getting ready for Christmas.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a hoax anymore, though.  It&#39;s like a play, a ceremonial bit of fun.   Blowing out candles and making a wish isn&#39;t a lie.  It&#39;s just a thing people  have done for a long time.  <br/>
<br/>
I have a link that&#39;s not about Santa, but about ceremony and ancient belief, and cakes: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/cake">http://sandradodd.com/cake</a><br/>
That&#39;s one of my favorite pages, and has a good story about my kids when they were little, but it&#39;s not &quot;about unschooling&quot; in most people&#39;s minds.  (In mine it&#39;s about learning and collecting related ideas, so... maybe.)<br/>

Just to clarify, this happened immediately after the boy told her and she was very upset. She was saying she didn&#39;t want to hear that yet, but was asking me if it was true. So, I was trying to feel out what she wanted at that moment so I could give that to her.<br/>
<br/>
She said she wanted to believe Santa did come to her house and give her presents under the tree, she is 11 now, and continued to believe in Santa as she had for two more Christmases. <br/>
<br/>
Then she decided it would be fun to go out on Black Friday and get to BE Santa for the little kids. So, we&#39;ve been having fun with that. This year, she even picked out her own present and wants to wait for Christmas morning to open it. She still plays Santa with her little brothers and sisters, and believes in the spirit of Santa.<br/>
