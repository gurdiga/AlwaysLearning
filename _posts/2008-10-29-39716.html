<div id="ygrps-yiv-499817152">Just as I thought I read most of the quotes that support unschooling, I <br/>
came across the following quote:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Just as eating contrary to the inclination is injurious to the health, <br/>
so study without desire spoils the memory, and it retains nothing that <br/>
it takes in.&quot; <br/>
-Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519)<br/>
<br/>
A computer is impartial. It will save and store anything, and we can <br/>
retrieve it from the computer just as we put it in there. But our minds <br/>
don&#39;t work that way. If something doesn&#39;t matter to us, if it has no <br/>
relevance to anything in our lives, then there is no reason for us to <br/>
remember it, and we usually don&#39;t. But when we choose to study <br/>
something that is important to us, when we have that desire, then what <br/>
we learn becomes a part of who we are. We make room for the memory in <br/>
our mind, and we use the information in context with what we already <br/>
know. <br/>
