<div id="ygrps-yiv-1932887467">I&#39;m going to come back to this topic to tell a story about what Kirby  <br/>
did Thursday through Saturday, but I&#39;ll start it with this:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
These comments were under the video of Holly, on YouTube.  I suppose  <br/>
the comments got stirred up because of the shit storm last week.  Some  <br/>
of these comments are very new.<br/>
<br/>
i2Dog I just want to say to people look at the current job markets. If  <br/>
you want to make more that $11.00 dollars a hour then collage﻿ is a  <br/>
must. Even secretaries, hair stylist, cooks/cheifs ,musicians, have  <br/>
some collage education or university education. But if you want an  <br/>
instant job that pays good money then going to collage or university  <br/>
and learning nursing or something related is the best.<br/>
=================================<br/>

HomieFilms @GreenFi5h<br/>
stop trying to defend this dumb bitch. Sure college does not guarantee  <br/>
success but﻿ sitting at home doing nothing sure doesn&#39;t help you get  <br/>
a good job you dumb fuck.<br/>
she is going to be crippled her whole life because she missed 13 years  <br/>
of school and catching up with all those things is going to be hard. 17 <br/>

pwnuloser3200 @HomieFilms you are so right!!!! good shit dude!!﻿ I  <br/>
know I love school because it&#39;s going to be worth it :P<br/>
=================================<br/>
<br/>
These are the people who are pretty sure they&#39;re going to get &quot;an  <br/>
instant job that pays good<br/>
  money.&quot;?<br/>
I hope school does turn out to be &quot;worth it&quot; for pwnuloser.  I&#39;m glad  <br/>
he loves school.<br/>
<br/>
Holly had a $10 an hour job working to help set up an art gallery in  <br/>
Silver City.  I forgot about that, when I was wasting my time  <br/>
responding on YouTube.  Oh well...<br/>

<br/>
In my opinion, that is THE biggest lie that schools tell children to keep them there.  Parents fall right into it because they don&#39;t want their children to grow up unable to support themselves.<br/>
<br/>
My husband was a kid that liked school and did decently well.  He tried college and ended up failing too many classes trying to work full time and do school full time.  He never finished.  What he does for a living now, he learned himself.  Someone offered him a job the other day through word of mouth.  I don&#39;t know if he&#39;ll accept it yet, it depends on the details.  He doesn&#39;t have lofty aspirations to be a CEO of a fortune 500 company.  He&#39;s an artist mostly, so work is earning a living for his family, it&#39;s peripheral to what he loves to do.  What he loves to do is hang out with his family, play music, and create things.<br/>
<br/>
No amount of schooling or college could help him do what he loves to do.  At one point he was in a band that was doing really well, getting a lot of reviews, had money, and then one member decided to steal all of that money and skip town.  The means to do what one loves as a way to support oneself financially is partially luck, partially just doing it, and partially talent.  I don&#39;t see anywhere in that, how the lack of school would factor in, unless what you want requires it, and that would be college level things and falls under the &quot;just doing it&quot;.  I&#39;m confident that unschoolers who choose that, do well.<br/>

<br/>
I used to work as a writer for a news portal on the Internet, and at some time, I stopped reading comments. I had the feeling that people were commenting only to dump (is this a verb in English ?) their frustration and their unhappiness, and to blame somebody - anybody - about it. YouTube is full of such comments, for what I have seen. <br/>
<br/>
My English isn&#39;t good enough to put it well, but I have the feeling that, somehow, on some level, kids know/feel/guess that what they are told about school isn&#39;t completely right. This whole propaganda. You can buy it or not, but there is a part of you, even a tiny one, who feels that something isn&#39;t right. So when somebody comes, who never had to play this foolish game, who is happy and successful, this person is too often welcomed by anger, and resentment, even hatred. <br/>
<br/>
I wonder if you&#39;ve heard (probably) of this great little book : &quot;The adventures of Johnny Bunko&quot;, from Daniel Pink. <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Adventures-Johnny-Bunko-Career-Guide/dp/1594482918/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1272228376&sr=8-1">http://www.amazon.com/Adventures-Johnny-Bunko-Career-Guide/dp/1594482918/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1272228376&sr=8-1</a><br/>
<br/>
It is a career guide written in the manga format - and basically, it says that what teachers, counselors, etc. told you to do in order to find a great job doesn&#39;t work. <br/>
<br/>
For instance, the first &quot;lesson&quot; says : <br/>
&quot;There is no plan. You can&#39;t map it all out. You might think that X will lead to Y , and Y will lead to Z, but it never works that way. Life isn&#39;t an algebra problem. Well, actually, it&#39;s like an algebra problem, painted by Salvador Dali. X might lead to W and W might lead to the color blue. And the color blue might lead to a chicken quesadilla. It&#39;s nice to believe that you can map out every step ahead of time and end up where you want. But that&#39;s a fantasy. The world changes. Ten years from now, your job might be in India. Your industry might not even exist. And you&#39;ll change, too. You might discover a hidden talent. You might fall in love and move to Tahiti. So you need to make smart choices. But you can make career decisions for two different types of reasons. You can do something for instrumental reasons - because you think it&#39;s going to lead to something else, regardless of whether you enjoy it or it&#39;s worthwile ... or you can do something for fundamental reasons - because you think it&#39;s inherently valuable, regardless of what it may or may not lead to. The dirty little secret is that instrumental reasons usually don&#39;t work. Things are too complicated, too unpredictable. The most successful people - not all of the time, but most of the time - make decisions for fundamental reasons.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
How unschoolish does that sound ? <br/>
<br/>
I really liked it. And I think that Daniel Pink has it quite right. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1132051">Kirby took a day or two of his paid vacation time (I should&#39;ve asked  <br/>
him before he went to work; it might have been two days) and his  <br/>
weekend to work a temporary job.<br/>
<br/>
A female friend of his (sister or friend of a co-worker, someone he  <br/>
met socially through co-workers) asked him if he would like to help  <br/>
her as a stage hand at a small festival.  Sure, he said.  It would be  <br/>
his weekend (Friday and Saturday) and he would take Thursday off.<br/>
<br/>
He thought it was just for free, helping a friend, but it turns out he  <br/>
makes $150.<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby was a young teen and had a job a friend of his and Marty&#39;s  <br/>
asked how he could get a job there too.  They said he should go with  <br/>
them to help fold flyers or set up tables for a gaming tournament.    <br/>
Marty used to go and help and sometimes they would give him store  <br/>
credit.   The friend said no way, he wasn&#39;t going to work for them for  <br/>
free.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s how Kirby had gotten the job, though, hanging out, being  <br/>
interesting and being helpful.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s how Kirby got this job, too.  Hanging out, being interesting,  <br/>
seeming competent, and being willing.<br/>
<br/>
Before you all consider telling your children and spouses or parents  <br/>
what it was Kirby did, though, maybe peek in private at the event at  <br/>
which he helped set up and then was a stagehand.  He was also a stunt  <br/>
man, unexpectedly.  I&#39;ll let you know after I talk to him whether he  <br/>
got paid extra for that, but Friday and he thought probably again  <br/>
Saturday it would happen, he was part of between-sessions entertainment:<br/>
<br/>
Hit on the head with a [prop/trick] frying pan &quot;to set the world  <br/>
record,&quot;<br/>
had a cinder block laid on his groin and broken with a sledge hammer  <br/>
(he said it didn&#39;t hurt but he acted the heck out of it at first)<br/>
and was a human dartboard (wood secretly covering his spine, and  <br/>
special darts that stuck a little into his back but mostly into the  <br/>
target).<br/>
<br/>
Okay.   The conference is this:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.texasburlesquefest.com/">http://www.texasburlesquefest.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t show the photos to anyone under 18 as that might be illegal.   <br/>
Kirby will be 24 this summer (just a reminder).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2134912031">One day Simon and Linnaea and I were sitting in the front garden of our terraced house playing the Pokemon board game. Three little boys came over and started talking to us. They asked about Simon and Linnaea and wanted to know where they went to school. I told them they didn&#39;t go to school, that we home-educated them. One little boy got really angry when he heard that Simon, a boy his age, didn&#39;t go to school. He didn&#39;t want to know that there was another way. Knowing that there was another way made his suffering unneccessary. It meant that every morning when he dragged his feet to go to school and his mom or his dad yelled at him, that was something that didn&#39;t have to be true. He got angry and he said that Simon and Linnaea had to go to school and I let it go, because he was 6 and he didn&#39;t need to feel more lost than he already felt. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve thought about that little boy, who I never really talked to again, it was just a moment of meeting up on a sunny day in the north of England, and his shattered belief in the necessity of school and I have hoped that he&#39;s forgotten. I know there are other children whose lives we have strewn with discontent simply by the choices we have made for our children. I&#39;m listening to the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/listen/teenpanel">http://sandradodd.com/listen/teenpanel</a> and that comes up at about 23 minutes into the talk. The realisation that a life is better, that the freedoms that the speaker has are greater than those of their more traditionally parented peers and how do you say that without hurting the person you are talking to. <br/>
<br/>
So, maybe all those mean commenting folks are so invested in what they did that they have to justify how it had to work for them and how it has to fail for our kids and for Holly and Brenna and what a total mess we are making of their childhoods, that they are angry to see someone articulate, someone clearly enjoying their life, so they have to tell stories of gloom and doom. <br/>
<br/>
The other day, on the drive to Morris dancing practice, Linnaea and I were talking about Two and a Half Men. I was comparing the early episodes to the Ant and the Grasshopper parable and how Alan was the ant and Charlie was the grasshopper and how the ant always seemed to suffer while the grasshopper continued to dance in the sunshine. Linnaea hadn&#39;t heard the story of the ant and the grasshopper so I told it to her and she dismissed it, saying that she enjoyed working, harvesting, gathering from the garden and that you didn&#39;t have to suffer to save. And I talked about how, apparently, ants only work about 25% of the time, laying around and idling much of the rest of the time. And she added that most ants are dead before the winter anyhow, at least in colder climates. But that story was something that was used against me in my childhood. I was encouraged to be the ant. I was encouraged to look to the long-term goals over the short-term ones. I can<br/>
 imagine feeling that a childhood of joy and laughter would lead to an adulthood of unemployment and hardship. That you have to pay the piper. <br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I&#39;m not saying that these folks are forgiveable, just that they are probably miserable. <br/>

<br/>
Sorry if I sound harsh, but you could stop taking this stuff so seriously.<br/>
@$$holes abound on the net. People in the public eye get shit written about<br/>
them. You are a star. Holly is a star. You have a great purpose you are<br/>
following. There&#39;s no sense in letting this stuff get to you. We can&#39;t be<br/>
universally respected and liked if we promote radical ways of thought.<br/>
<br/>
The more boats you shake, the more caustic fallout is going to happen. Its<br/>
not criticism of either you or them. It just is. You are a great resource<br/>
for those who looked for a better way out of that leaky boat. You have<br/>
changed countless lives and have tons of people who appreciate the time you<br/>
spend thinking about them and their situations. No point being offended by<br/>
those who didn&#39;t and chose to plug leaks with great loads of stinky goo.<br/>
<br/>
I understand that it leaves a nasty feeling. Heck, I&#39;ve never met Holly, but<br/>
I don&#39;t like those comments either. Its just that those crazy people will<br/>
write a few thoughtless comments, which contaminate your joy for half a day<br/>
(more?), while they probably went on with their lives the minute they hit<br/>
&#39;send&#39;. Why? Why give them that importance?<br/>
<br/>
People see what they project. the crap is in their minds. Like the Buddha,<br/>
we can refuse to call it ours and leave it at that.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if this offends. Its not that I&#39;m unsympathetic or that I don&#39;t care.<br/>
I do, but I care about you and Holly. I just don&#39;t see the value in those<br/>
people to make them such a focus. I am astounded by you taking those<br/>
comments seriously. In your place, I wouldn&#39;t have given them further<br/>
attention beyond &quot;thank you for providing a sample of what 13 years of<br/>
school could have made Holly&quot; and left it at that. Whatever they write, how<br/>
does it matter? The people who matter already know its nonsense.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a classic example of how school has brainwashed people into thinking that if a person &quot;fails&quot; school that&#39;s it for ever. To begin with, missing 13 years of school is not the same as missing 13 years of education. Schools spread the imparting of knowledge out across a long period of time for reasons that are nothing to do with education. Add to that all the &#39;downtime&#39; in a typical school day. When I obtained some academic qualifications through a correspondence college in 1976, eight years after I quit school, the syllabus my high school had taken four years to cover I covered in nine months studying in my spare time. In the world at large, a self-motivated learner is free to catch up with anything they feel the need to catch up with at any time.<br/>
<br/>
Win Wenger, acknowledged creative genius and author of a book called &quot;The Einstein Factor&quot;, once said (don&#39;t recall where now) that everything school students really need to know could be taught in 100 hours. I did email him to enquire what it is that he thought students really need to know but I didn&#39;t get a reply.<br/>
<br/>
Just having a quick look at his &quot;Project Renaissance&quot; website, this is what he writes as the opening to an article called The Future of Education:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;One of the missions of Project Renaissance is to raise consciousness about the inadequacies of the traditional school system and its entrenched approach to education, which has squandered the gifts and potentialities of generations of human beings.&quot;<br/>

2nd clip? I didn&#39;t see her.). That she was jealous of the schooling<br/>
she went through and of her status of success as an anchor, something<br/>
she&#39;s very proud of but that might not have been very fun. So having<br/>
the idea that &quot;you play, you pay&quot; in mind, she might perceive<br/>
unschoolers as unrealistic because of course she doesn&#39;t have any<br/>
other experience to compare hers with other than school.<br/>
<br/>
What a stew. The clips too but I mean the stew that is the mind of schoolthink.<br/>

&gt; and started talking to us. They asked about Simon and Linnaea and wanted to<br/>
&gt; know where they went to school. I told them they didn&#39;t go to school, that<br/>
&gt; we home-educated them. One little boy got really angry when he heard that<br/>
&gt; Simon, a boy his age, didn&#39;t go to school. He didn&#39;t want to know that there<br/>
&gt; was another way. Knowing that there was another way made his suffering<br/>
&gt; unneccessary. It meant that every morning when he dragged his feet to go to<br/>
&gt; school and his mom or his dad yelled at him, that was something that didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have to be true. He got angry and he said that Simon and Linnaea had to go<br/>
&gt; to school and I let it go, because he was 6 and he didn&#39;t need to feel more<br/>
&gt; lost than he already felt.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve thought about that little boy, who I never really talked to again, it<br/>
&gt; was just a moment of meeting up on a sunny day in the north of England, and<br/>
&gt; his shattered belief in the necessity of school and I have hoped that he&#39;s<br/>
&gt; forgotten. I know there are other children whose lives we have strewn with<br/>
&gt; discontent simply by the choices we have made for our children. I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; listening to the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/listen/teenpanel">http://sandradodd.com/listen/teenpanel</a> and that comes up at<br/>
&gt; about 23 minutes into the talk. The realisation that a life is better, that<br/>
&gt; the freedoms that the speaker has are greater than those of their more<br/>
&gt; traditionally parented peers and how do you say that without hurting the<br/>
&gt; person you are talking to.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, maybe all those mean commenting folks are so invested in what they did<br/>
&gt; that they have to justify how it had to work for them and how it has to fail<br/>
&gt; for our kids and for Holly and Brenna and what a total mess we are making of<br/>
&gt; their childhoods, that they are angry to see someone articulate, someone<br/>
&gt; clearly enjoying their life, so they have to tell stories of gloom and doom.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The other day, on the drive to Morris dancing practice, Linnaea and I were<br/>
&gt; talking about Two and a Half Men. I was comparing the early episodes to the<br/>
&gt; Ant and the Grasshopper parable and how Alan was the ant and Charlie was the<br/>
&gt; grasshopper and how the ant always seemed to suffer while the grasshopper<br/>
&gt; continued to dance in the sunshine. Linnaea hadn&#39;t heard the story of the<br/>
&gt; ant and the grasshopper so I told it to her and she dismissed it, saying<br/>
&gt; that she enjoyed working, harvesting, gathering from the garden and that you<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t have to suffer to save. And I talked about how, apparently, ants only<br/>
&gt; work about 25% of the time, laying around and idling much of the rest of the<br/>
&gt; time. And she added that most ants are dead before the winter anyhow, at<br/>
&gt; least in colder climates. But that story was something that was used against<br/>
&gt; me in my childhood. I was encouraged to be the ant. I was encouraged to look<br/>
&gt; to the long-term goals over the short-term ones. I can<br/>
&gt;  imagine feeling that a childhood of joy and laughter would lead to an<br/>
&gt; adulthood of unemployment and hardship. That you have to pay the piper.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyhow, I&#39;m not saying that these folks are forgiveable, just that they are<br/>
&gt; probably miserable.<br/>

&gt; I used to work as a writer for a news portal on the Internet, and at some<br/>
&gt; time, I stopped reading comments. I had the feeling that people were<br/>
&gt; commenting only to dump (is this a verb in English ?) their frustration and<br/>
&gt; their unhappiness, and to blame somebody - anybody - about it. YouTube is<br/>
&gt; full of such comments, for what I have seen.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My English isn&#39;t good enough to put it well, but I have the feeling that,<br/>
&gt; somehow, on some level, kids know/feel/guess that what they are told about<br/>
&gt; school isn&#39;t completely right. This whole propaganda. You can buy it or not,<br/>
&gt; but there is a part of you, even a tiny one, who feels that something isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; right. So when somebody comes, who never had to play this foolish game, who<br/>
&gt; is happy and successful, this person is too often welcomed by anger, and<br/>
&gt; resentment, even hatred.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Schuyler, I agree. I read that quote with all the misspelled words and I thought, hm, is this person even an adult yet? Or is this a young person whose parents have been trying to get him/her to believe in the system and, so far, it&#39;s working?<br/>
<br/>
I suspect that&#39;s why there is so much &quot;poof&quot; after an unschooling piece on a major network. It&#39;s like dropping the match over the flambee. Conditions are already ripe for a reaction -- all the ingredients are there. People know that *most* kids aren&#39;t happy in school. Most adults have a residual aching feeling about their own school experiences. It&#39;s the elephant in the room because our society says, &quot;In order to be successful, school is a necessary evil, so either fall in line or go lie in the gutter.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When people see that there really is another way (in our society, at least) and that it makes for happy children and parents, it shakes the very core of their fragile tower of social compliance. They react because it&#39;s scary and yes, it likely increases their own feelings of unhappiness. Digging themselves into a position feels safe and stable (although I believe that the  seed has already been planted).<br/>

<h4>Sandra Dodd</h4>
<time>26 Apr 2010, at  9:44am</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1214307654">-=- But that story was something that was used against me in my  <br/>
childhood. I was encouraged to be the ant. I was encouraged to look to  <br/>
the long-term goals over the short-term ones. I can imagine feeling  <br/>
that a childhood of joy and laughter would lead to an adulthood of  <br/>
unemployment and hardship. That you have to pay the piper. -=-<br/>
<br/>
How true!  We had that story in two or three of our &quot;readers&quot; or it  <br/>
came up one way or another more than twice while I was in elementary  <br/>
school.  And it was on TV, on some kids&#39; show (Captain Kangaroo,  <br/>
probably).<br/>
<br/>
It was a way to make people feel guilty early and often, if they  <br/>
weren&#39;t doing what would lead to a long, secure winter.  And maybe  <br/>
that came partly from the horrors of the 19th century and early 20th  <br/>
in general--diseases and wars and the ease with which people were just  <br/>
put off land they had worked and built houses on.  I know that still  <br/>
happens some places, but in Europe and the U.S., it was happening  <br/>
quite a bit, in various places, in those days.  And for black families  <br/>
in the U.S.... double disaster with disease and the Great Depression.<br/>
<br/>
So being irresponsible and farting around (or drinking--prohibition  <br/>
days in the U.S.) were the worst possible things to do.  Thousands  <br/>
would turn and point and say &quot;stop it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps those in the discussions who are telling me and a bunch of you  <br/>
that we&#39;re the worst possible parents and the lowest type of idiots  <br/>
are carrying on that tradition.  But I think this is a big part, too.   <br/>
I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s Joanna Murphy.  I wrote to ask but the mail was  <br/>
returned.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Joanna has left a new comment on the post &quot;Unschooling - what do you<br/>
think?&quot;:<br/>
<br/>
Crunchy Chicken said: &quot;Many unschoolers have painted traditional<br/>
schooling with a broad brush that is offensive to many, much like the<br/>
opposite side has done with unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s not the same. All of us who unschool have come from a<br/>
background of having gone to school, and often having had our kids in<br/>
school. My oldest was in two schools, as a matter of fact. That<br/>
doesn&#39;t make me an expert on schools, but it does give me a base of<br/>
experience, combined with my own and my husband&#39;s experience, to form<br/>
an intelligent opinion about school.<br/>
<br/>
If I say something unflattering about school, it&#39;s because I had a<br/>
real experience. And I answer the statewide homeschool information<br/>
line for my state, so I many experiences to draw on from which to form<br/>
an opinion. People talking about unschooling who haven&#39;t DONE<br/>
unschooling, or seen it in action in some concrete way don&#39;t have the<br/>
right to paint any picture of it at all. They can make connections,<br/>
ask questions, have an opinion, etc., but to make any pronouncements<br/>
about it such as it couldn&#39;t possibly work, doesn&#39;t really make sense<br/>
to me at all.<br/>
<br/>
If someone says something &quot;offensive&quot; about school, and a reader<br/>
hasn&#39;t had that experience, then chances are they know someone who<br/>
has. If they haven&#39;t and they don&#39;t, then that&#39;s fine too (and a good<br/>
thing!), but the stories are in the news all the time. It&#39;s not as if<br/>
we are making this stuff up! There are reasons that we&#39;ve searched out<br/>
an alternative to traditional schooling. And don&#39;t forget that you<br/>
posed the question on your blog. If we all felt warm and fuzzy about<br/>
traditional school, we probably wouldn&#39;t have chosen to unschool, and<br/>
you wouldn&#39;t have asked the question.<br/>
<br/>
======<br/>
<br/>
It is complex, whatever it all is, and we&#39;re at the bottom of the  <br/>
funnel getting dumped on sometimes.<br/>

<br/>
Sandra, absolutely.  In fact, I really admire your approach in responding to some of those comments, because in your shoes my short temper would probably have prompted me to fire off a few - no, a lot - of four-letter words that would have accomplished nothing except to bait the trolls. <br/>
<br/>
I am so grateful and appreciative for all that you have done and continue to do, the time you spend, the efforts that you make.  I spent the first half of my life involved in show biz, so I understand what it&#39;s like to put yourself out there and be left open to criticism and opinions that are not always kind.  I can&#39;t imagine what it feels like when the person being criticized is your child.  My daughter (Dee) is nine, and when she read some of the comments about Holly she was angry. She called those posters ignoramuses, and I wholeheartedly agree.<br/>

Lately, I&#39;ve also appreciated hearing you mention things like that you felt overwhelmed when your kids were young, or a certain time when things weren&#39;t perfect between Keith and Kirby. And I appreciated you sharing your hell of a week, too. It was kind of nice to realize that happens to you sometimes! And to send my sympathy out into the ether, for what it was worth.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think this list is perfect, but when I&#39;ve tried to join other unschooling discussion lists, it always ends up feeling like there&#39;s just not as high a standard. I recently joined one where the first lengthy discussion I saw was all about what math curriculum to buy. &quot;This is an unschooling list?&quot; I thought. Nobody was even bothering to question whether buying a math curriculum was a good idea or not. I don&#39;t need people telling me to buy a math curriculum; I struggle to let go of the idea that my kids (my oldest in particular) &quot;should&quot; be at a certain level in math and reading. I need people who, if I say, &quot;I&#39;m thinking about doing math worksheets with Eric...&quot; will question that, give me other ideas, tell me stories of how their kids learned and used math.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1510585300">&quot;One of the missions of Project Renaissance is to raise consciousness about the inadequacies of the traditional school system and its entrenched approach to education, which has squandered the gifts and potentialities of generations of human beings.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Oh Bob!  That is something that I feel deeply all the time!  I have all these amazing teenagers that Chamille has brought to my life, schooled kids, that are just brilliant and full of life.  It&#39;s so sad to me, to see all that wonderful creative energy stuck inside 4 walls all day doing meaningless to them stuff with the promise of one day being able to use that meaningless stuff.<br/>
<br/>
The sheer boredom and hatred of school that they experience is only part of the damage!  By the time they get to 18 or 24 they have lost lots of that energy that so many teenagers just have.  I so love that my kids don&#39;t have to experience either of those things.  They don&#39;t need to experience boredom combined with hatred and feeling stuck.  They can use that wonderful energy to keep their momentum of life going.  School is like riding a bike and slowing down at the bottom of a big hill.  Real life is like taking the momentum of the fun ride down hill to pull you up the next hill.<br/>

<br/>
This is beautiful.<br/>
I&#39;m glad for all the great writing today.  It&#39;s also a little  <br/>
depressing.<br/>
<br/>
I was just talking to Kirby.  He said the girl who had the stage crew  <br/>
contract works with him at Blizzard, and she&#39;s also an exotic dancer.   <br/>
She performed the first night.  I asked him if it was awkward, seeing  <br/>
a co-worker naked.  He said not for him, but his boss didn&#39;t come to  <br/>
the festival at all because of that.  He told the boss that Midge was  <br/>
only performing on Thursday and that he could come one of the other  <br/>
nights, but he opted out, Kirby figured for fear of seeing an employee  <br/>
&quot;out of uniform.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He did indeed get to be a stuntman again the next night, and said  <br/>
&quot;only one person stuck me with a dart Saturday night.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
OH!  I didn&#39;t know the darts were being thrown from the audience!!  He  <br/>
had a blast.<br/>
<br/>
The people he most enjoyed meeting and talking to were two veteran  <br/>
performers, one older than I am (Satan&#39;s Angel) and one not quite so  <br/>
old, but still has been doing it a long time (Dusty Summers).  They  <br/>
were talkative and interesting and he was glad to meet them.  He said  <br/>
the performers and organizers seemed ecstatic that they were there, so  <br/>
they must be famous within the industry.<br/>
<br/>
He told me about the sole male performer, &quot;The Mystic,&quot; a  <br/>
contortionist who wore a face mask; a hoop-hanging acrobat; a midget  <br/>
who did a routine to an AC-DC song, dressed in a school-boy uniform  <br/>
(at first).<br/>
<br/>
He said the show ended at 12:30 Saturday night, and they finished  <br/>
breaking down at 4:30 a.m.   Then he worked at his regular job on  <br/>
Sunday.<br/>
<br/>
So he learned a lot.  Not a bit of it was stuff he would&#39;ve learned in  <br/>
school  ;-P<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-116498492">Sandra, I didn&#39;t think *you* were crying at all! I lost the thought in<br/>
the original post and I was being  much more general when I said<br/>
&quot;silly.&quot; I wasn&#39;t talking about any specific individual. My comment<br/>
wasn&#39;t about you. And had I paid more attention to the direction of<br/>
the entire thread, I could have avoided seeming more specific than I<br/>
intended.<br/>
<br/>
And I don&#39;t seriously see many unschooling parents crying. Some may<br/>
have been focusing on the negatives of criticism a bit more than<br/>
others. But I mostly just saw annoyance at wanting to answer<br/>
uninformed opinion but really preferring to get on with their own<br/>
happy lives away from crud and criticism.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s silly are the comments about Holly. Goofy stuff.<br/>

Geez, I thought it was. That&#39;s such a big part of unschooling in the<br/>
first place. It IS about feelings. Which is why education, though a<br/>
by-product of paying attention to the emotional life of a family,<br/>
isn&#39;t the primary focus of unschooling.<br/>

&gt; I have actually always been amazed at you, Joyce, and Pam and how you have<br/>
&gt; hung in over the years. I used to be a moderator on AlwaysUnschooled, and I<br/>
&gt; left the list partly for personal reasons and partly because I just didn&#39;t<br/>

I took that quote from a post on feelings but I had to because it really drove things home for me in trying to answer this question. I&#39;ve been thinking about the question since it was first posted. I wrote a couple of responses but they were too lengthy and meandering. This quote, though, gets right to it. <br/>
<br/>
No amount of education or knowledge or intelligence or success is worth anything if one is not happy, if one doesn&#39;t feel good about himself and what he does. It is more important to me that my children feel good about themselves than that they can spit back rote answers on a test. If they feel good about themselves and they&#39;ve learned the tools necessary to find any answers they need, they can do anything.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2100215744">I&#39;ve been thinking about this some more. I find it interesting that people can say that unschooled kids will grow up to be unemployable adults. Maybe it would be possible to find some adults who were unschooled who don&#39;t contribute to society in any way just because anything is a possibility. I don&#39;t have any idea how many unschooled adults are out there and what they are doing. However, there are many, many schooled adults who don&#39;t work, are unemployable and are otherwise not contributing to society. It&#39;s absolutely ridiculous to say that since an 18 or 22 or 24 year old didn&#39;t go to college or isn&#39;t completely self-sufficient that unschooling doesn&#39;t work. If that were true, what does that say about the numerous schooled adults who haven&#39;t done that? When you look at the big picture, statements like that make school look worse, in my opinion.<br/>
