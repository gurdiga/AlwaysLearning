<div id="ygrps-yiv-1604330412">My friend runs a local homeschooling website and part of it is &quot;Teaching Methods&quot; where she has a list of all the different homeschooling styles. She asked me to write an article on unschooling.  I&#39;m putting it here, before I send the final product to her, because I&#39;d like some feedback.  Please feel free to let me know if you notice any spelling or grammar errors.  I used to write all the time, was in AP English in highschool etc., but the last few years all the writing I&#39;ve done has been for email lists and message boards.  I&#39;m embarrassed to say that the quality reflects that.  :(  <br/>
<br/>
Oh, also, my friend wanted me to focus on academic unschooling, not radical unschooling.  I told her that I couldn&#39;t really help putting things about real life into the article because radical unschooling is so much a part of my life now.  But I did say that I wouldn&#39;t accentuate the difference between unschooling and radical unschooling or make radical unschooling the focus.  <br/>

_____________________________________________<br/>
What is Unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Watch how a baby learns to walk.  They observe what others are doing, they work their muscles and get them ready, their balance improves, and then slowly as they are able they pull up and stand alone and take that first step.  They don&#39;t have a &quot;goal&quot; to walk.  They don&#39;t decide that they will walk and then make a plan to accomplish that goal.  The baby&#39;s parents trust that the baby will walk.  They know they don&#39;t need to coerce, bribe or otherwise entice their baby, because it&#39;s part of the baby&#39;s natural tendency and genetic makeup to want to grow, to learn and to do what adults do.  All a parent needs to do is provide a safe place to move and opportunities for the baby to stretch those muscles.  <br/>
<br/>
Watch how a 3 year old explores the world.  Running from one thing to the next, soaking it all in and asking Why? And What&#39;s that? At every turn.  Sometimes she stops for a moment to really focus on something.  A blade of grass can become the most facinating thing in the world, as she turns it from side to side, watches it sway in the breeze, notices the little bug perched on the end.  And then her interest turns elsewhere- what is that bug, what is it called, why is it moving that way, what sound does it make.  But the little one&#39;s attention doesn&#39;t stay on one thing for long, and she has quickly run to the next thing.  Was there no learning there?  Was it all lost?  No, because she made a connection that will last a lifetime.  The next time she sees a bug or watches something move in the wind, she will remember what she already learned and add to it.  Every expreience builds on the ones before it and slightly (or dramatically) changes her perception of the world.   The involved parent will answer her questions and get down on the ground with her and explore and laugh and maybe point something out she hadn&#39;t noticed. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easy to see this learning in babies learning to walk and talk and 3 year olds playing.  Sometimes, it&#39;s harder to observe in older kids who may not ask Why? 3000 times a day.   And sometimes it&#39;s hard to imagine that algebra and reading, manners and cleaning, the history of Rome and the writing of Shakespeare could possibly be learned the same way.  But that&#39;s exactly how unschoolers learn.  In fact, it&#39;s exactly how all people learn to some extent.  If you started making a list of all the things you&#39;ve learned in your life, you may be surprised to find how many of those weren&#39;t learned by rote memorization, textbooks, or someone coercing you or bribing you to get it down long enough to take a test.  The things that we learn that really stick with us are the things we are interested in, that connect to other things we know, when our brains are mature enough to grasp the concepts.  We learn while we are playing and enjoying what we&#39;re doing and the company of those around us.  And sometimes, we learn because we have a goal we want to meet and we need to acquire certain knowledge or skills to attain that goal. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to define unschooling in a pat, one paragraph dictionary definition.  There is no unschooling organization that&#39;s handing down definitions and guidelines.  No list of unschooling rules.  It&#39;s a bit like life in that way- we&#39;re all living life, but some people are just breathing and taking up space.  We can do things that lead toward a more fullfilling life, a more peaceful life, better relationships and kinder actions.  A life that makes a difference in the world and a life that&#39;s lived for a purpose.  So, even though all of us learn some things in an natural way- those things that we are interested in, those things that we love and those things we&#39;ve chosen to learn to meet a goal- most people are not truly unschooling themselves or their children (nor would most claim to be, of course!).  We can do things that lead towards more natural learning and peaceful living.  We can let go of those things that are getting in the way of the relationships between ourselves and our children.  We can trust that our children were designed with an innate desire to learn, an inborn curiosity and a drive to explore the world around them.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it&#39;s easier to define something in terms of what it&#39;s not, especially with something like unschooling that is surrounded by many misconceptions and myths.  Unschooling is not educational neglect.  It&#39;s not leaving a child to his own devices to figure out the world with no guidance.  It&#39;s not passive or apathtic or careless.  On the other hand, guidance, being actively involved and caring is not the same as unit stuides or following interests after school work is done or &quot;making learning fun.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Learning is fun!  It&#39;s doesn&#39;t have to be manipulated to be enjoyable.  And all of a child&#39;s interests have real life application, because they are living real life right now, this moment.  Unit studies and curriculum have the purpose of pouring information into empty vessels.  Sometimes through force, coersion and rote memorization and sometimes through more benign means of sneaking math facts into play.  The unschooler recognizes that learning and life are not separate.  That there is already math in play.  That life is not a set of subjects, but rather that it&#39;s bits and pieces of information and experience that all flow together.  And as a person lives life, they cannot help but be immersed in that information and experience and it becomes a part of who they are.  <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is a partnership between a parent and child.  The unschooling parent knows that her child is a unique person, with unique gifts, talents and interests.  That she will have her own desires for her life and her own ideas about how to fulfil those desires.  And the parent trusts that her child will learn and grow and mature without bribery or coercion.  She makes an interesting life for her child, with lots of opportunities for her child to see, hear, taste, touch, and smell new things.  She explores the world with her child and they learn together.  She&#39;s present and aware, commited to being with her child in the moment.  She points things out and shares information, but not with the ulterior motive of teaching as if she were writing on a blank slate.  Instead she shares information with her child the same way she would share it with her friend.  Because it&#39;s exciting and important and she wants to connect with that person.</div>

&gt; _____________________________________________<br/>
&gt; What is Unschooling?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Watch how a baby learns to walk. They observe what others are doing, they<br/>
&gt; work their muscles and get them ready, their balance improves, and then<br/>
&gt; slowly as they are able they pull up and stand alone and take that first<br/>
&gt; step. They don&#39;t have a &quot;goal&quot; to walk. They don&#39;t decide that they will<br/>
&gt; walk and then make a plan to accomplish that goal. The baby&#39;s parents trust<br/>
&gt; that the baby will walk. They know they don&#39;t need to coerce, bribe or<br/>
&gt; otherwise entice their baby, because it&#39;s part of the baby&#39;s natural<br/>
&gt; tendency and genetic makeup to want to grow, to learn and to do what adults<br/>
&gt; do. All a parent needs to do is provide a safe place to move and<br/>
&gt; opportunities for the baby to stretch those muscles.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Watch how a 3 year old explores the world. Running from one thing to the<br/>
&gt; next, soaking it all in and asking Why? And What&#39;s that? At every turn.<br/>
&gt; Sometimes she stops for a moment to really focus on something. A blade of<br/>
&gt; grass can become the most facinating thing in the world, as she turns it<br/>
&gt; from side to side, watches it sway in the breeze, notices the little bug<br/>
&gt; perched on the end. And then her interest turns elsewhere- what is that bug,<br/>
&gt; what is it called, why is it moving that way, what sound does it make. But<br/>
&gt; the little one&#39;s attention doesn&#39;t stay on one thing for long, and she has<br/>
&gt; quickly run to the next thing. Was there no learning there? Was it all lost?<br/>
&gt; No, because she made a connection that will last a lifetime. The next time<br/>
&gt; she sees a bug or watches something move in the wind, she will remember what<br/>
&gt; she already learned and add to it. Every expreience builds on the ones<br/>
&gt; before it and slightly (or dramatically) changes her perception of the<br/>
&gt; world. The involved parent will answer her questions and get down on the<br/>
&gt; ground with her and explore and laugh and maybe point something out she<br/>
&gt; hadn&#39;t noticed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s easy to see this learning in babies learning to walk and talk and 3<br/>
&gt; year olds playing. Sometimes, it&#39;s harder to observe in older kids who may<br/>
&gt; not ask Why? 3000 times a day. And sometimes it&#39;s hard to imagine that<br/>
&gt; algebra and reading, manners and cleaning, the history of Rome and the<br/>
&gt; writing of Shakespeare could possibly be learned the same way. But that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; exactly how unschoolers learn. In fact, it&#39;s exactly how all people learn to<br/>
&gt; some extent. If you started making a list of all the things you&#39;ve learned<br/>
&gt; in your life, you may be surprised to find how many of those weren&#39;t learned<br/>
&gt; by rote memorization, textbooks, or someone coercing you or bribing you to<br/>
&gt; get it down long enough to take a test. The things that we learn that really<br/>
&gt; stick with us are the things we are interested in, that connect to other<br/>
&gt; things we know, when our brains are mature enough to grasp the concepts. We<br/>
&gt; learn while we are playing and enjoying what we&#39;re doing and the company of<br/>
&gt; those around us. And sometimes, we learn because we have a goal we want to<br/>
&gt; meet and we need to acquire certain knowledge or skills to attain that goal.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s hard to define unschooling in a pat, one paragraph dictionary<br/>
&gt; definition. There is no unschooling organization that&#39;s handing down<br/>
&gt; definitions and guidelines. No list of unschooling rules. It&#39;s a bit like<br/>
&gt; life in that way- we&#39;re all living life, but some people are just breathing<br/>
&gt; and taking up space. We can do things that lead toward a more fullfilling<br/>
&gt; life, a more peaceful life, better relationships and kinder actions. A life<br/>
&gt; that makes a difference in the world and a life that&#39;s lived for a purpose.<br/>
&gt; So, even though all of us learn some things in an natural way- those things<br/>
&gt; that we are interested in, those things that we love and those things we&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; chosen to learn to meet a goal- most people are not truly unschooling<br/>
&gt; themselves or their children (nor would most claim to be, of course!). We<br/>
&gt; can do things that lead towards more natural learning and peaceful living.<br/>
&gt; We can let go of those things that are getting in the way of the<br/>
&gt; relationships between ourselves and our children. We can trust that our<br/>
&gt; children were designed with an innate desire to learn, an inborn curiosity<br/>
&gt; and a drive to explore the world around them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sometimes it&#39;s easier to define something in terms of what it&#39;s not,<br/>
&gt; especially with something like unschooling that is surrounded by many<br/>
&gt; misconceptions and myths. Unschooling is not educational neglect. It&#39;s not<br/>
&gt; leaving a child to his own devices to figure out the world with no guidance.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s not passive or apathtic or careless. On the other hand, guidance, being<br/>
&gt; actively involved and caring is not the same as unit stuides or following<br/>
&gt; interests after school work is done or &quot;making learning fun.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Learning is fun! It&#39;s doesn&#39;t have to be manipulated to be enjoyable. And<br/>
&gt; all of a child&#39;s interests have real life application, because they are<br/>
&gt; living real life right now, this moment. Unit studies and curriculum have<br/>
&gt; the purpose of pouring information into empty vessels. Sometimes through<br/>
&gt; force, coersion and rote memorization and sometimes through more benign<br/>
&gt; means of sneaking math facts into play. The unschooler recognizes that<br/>
&gt; learning and life are not separate. That there is already math in play. That<br/>
&gt; life is not a set of subjects, but rather that it&#39;s bits and pieces of<br/>
&gt; information and experience that all flow together. And as a person lives<br/>
&gt; life, they cannot help but be immersed in that information and experience<br/>
&gt; and it becomes a part of who they are.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Unschooling is a partnership between a parent and child. The unschooling<br/>
&gt; parent knows that her child is a unique person, with unique gifts, talents<br/>
&gt; and interests. That she will have her own desires for her life and her own<br/>
&gt; ideas about how to fulfil those desires. And the parent trusts that her<br/>
&gt; child will learn and grow and mature without bribery or coercion. She makes<br/>
&gt; an interesting life for her child, with lots of opportunities for her child<br/>
&gt; to see, hear, taste, touch, and smell new things. She explores the world<br/>
&gt; with her child and they learn together. She&#39;s present and aware, commited to<br/>
&gt; being with her child in the moment. She points things out and shares<br/>
&gt; information, but not with the ulterior motive of teaching as if she were<br/>
&gt; writing on a blank slate. Instead she shares information with her child the<br/>
&gt; same way she would share it with her friend. Because it&#39;s exciting and<br/>
&gt; important and she wants to connect with that person.<br/>

&gt;&gt; that.  :(<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Oh, also, my friend wanted me to focus on academic unschooling, not  <br/>
&gt;&gt; radical unschooling.  I told her that I couldn&#39;t really help  <br/>
&gt;&gt; putting things about real life into the article because radical  <br/>
&gt;&gt; unschooling is so much a part of my life now.  But I did say that I  <br/>
&gt;&gt; wouldn&#39;t accentuate the difference between unschooling and radical  <br/>
&gt;&gt; unschooling or make radical unschooling the focus.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; _____________________________________________<br/>
&gt;&gt; What is Unschooling?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Watch how a baby learns to walk.  They observe what others are  <br/>
&gt;&gt; doing, they work their muscles and get them ready, their balance  <br/>
&gt;&gt; improves, and then slowly as they are able they pull up and stand  <br/>
&gt;&gt; alone and take that first step.  They don&#39;t have a &quot;goal&quot; to walk.   <br/>
&gt;&gt; They don&#39;t decide that they will walk and then make a plan to  <br/>
&gt;&gt; accomplish that goal.  The baby&#39;s parents trust that the baby will  <br/>
&gt;&gt; walk.  They know they don&#39;t need to coerce, bribe or otherwise  <br/>
&gt;&gt; entice their baby, because it&#39;s part of the baby&#39;s natural tendency  <br/>
&gt;&gt; and genetic makeup to want to grow, to learn and to do what adults  <br/>
&gt;&gt; do.  All a parent needs to do is provide a safe place to move and  <br/>
&gt;&gt; opportunities for the baby to stretch those muscles.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Watch how a 3 year old explores the world.  Running from one thing  <br/>
&gt;&gt; to the next, soaking it all in and asking Why? And What&#39;s that? At  <br/>
&gt;&gt; every turn.  Sometimes she stops for a moment to really focus on  <br/>
&gt;&gt; something.  A blade of grass can become the most facinating thing  <br/>
&gt;&gt; in the world, as she turns it from side to side, watches it sway in  <br/>
&gt;&gt; the breeze, notices the little bug perched on the end.  And then  <br/>
&gt;&gt; her interest turns elsewhere- what is that bug, what is it called,  <br/>
&gt;&gt; why is it moving that way, what sound does it make.  But the little  <br/>
&gt;&gt; one&#39;s attention doesn&#39;t stay on one thing for long, and she has  <br/>
&gt;&gt; quickly run to the next thing.  Was there no learning there?  Was  <br/>
&gt;&gt; it all lost?  No, because she made a connection that will last a  <br/>
&gt;&gt; lifetime.  The next time she sees a bug or watches something move  <br/>
&gt;&gt; in the wind, she will remember what she already learned and add to  <br/>
&gt;&gt; it.  Every expreience builds on the ones before it and slightly (or  <br/>
&gt;&gt; dramatically) changes her perception of the world.   The involved  <br/>
&gt;&gt; parent will answer her questions and get down on the ground with  <br/>
&gt;&gt; her and explore and laugh and maybe point something out she hadn&#39;t  <br/>
&gt;&gt; noticed.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; It&#39;s easy to see this learning in babies learning to walk and talk  <br/>
&gt;&gt; and 3 year olds playing.  Sometimes, it&#39;s harder to observe in  <br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; Sometimes it&#39;s easier to define something in terms of what it&#39;s  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; not, especially with something like unschooling that is surrounded  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; by many misconceptions and myths.  Unschooling is not educational  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; neglect.  It&#39;s not leaving a child to his own devices to figure out  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; the world with no guidance.  It&#39;s not passive or apathtic or  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; careless.  On the other hand, guidance, being actively involved and  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; caring is not the same as unit stuides or following interests after  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; school work is done or &quot;making learning fun.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Learning is fun!  It&#39;s doesn&#39;t have to be manipulated to be  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; enjoyable.  And all of a child&#39;s interests have real life  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; application, because they are living real life right now, this  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; moment.  Unit studies and curriculum have the purpose of pouring  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; information into empty vessels.  Sometimes through force, coersion  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; and rote memorization and sometimes through more benign means of  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; sneaking math facts into play.  The unschooler recognizes that  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; learning and life are not separate.  That there is already math in  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; play.  That life is not a set of subjects, but rather that it&#39;s  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; bits and pieces of information and experience that all flow  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; together.  And as a person lives life, they cannot help but be  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; immersed in that information and experience and it becomes a part  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; of who they are.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Unschooling is a partnership between a parent and child.  The  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; unschooling parent knows that her child is a unique person, with  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; unique gifts, talents and interests.  That she will have her own  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; desires for her life and her own ideas about how to fulfil those  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; desires.  And the parent trusts that her child will learn and grow  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; and mature without bribery or coercion.  She makes an interesting  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; life for her child, with lots of opportunities for her child to  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; see, hear, taste, touch, and smell new things.  She explores the  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; world with her child and they learn together.  She&#39;s present and  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; aware, commited to being with her child in the moment.  She points  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; things out and shares information, but not with the ulterior motive  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; of teaching as if she were writing on a blank slate.  Instead she  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; shares information with her child the same way she would share it  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; with her friend.  Because it&#39;s exciting and important and she wants  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; to connect with that person.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-880137793">I too will share this with many, there are so many new homeschooling families that are leaving the public school world dismayed at what has happened to their kids, without knowledge of what unschooling is it feels so foreign to people who don&#39;t understand it. What a wonderful and wonder filled way to learn! Thanks for sharing this. Sunny<br/>

&gt; write all the time, was in AP English in highschool etc., but the last few<br/>
&gt; years all the writing I&#39;ve done has been for email lists and message boards.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m embarrassed to say that the quality reflects that. :(<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh, also, my friend wanted me to focus on academic unschooling, not radical<br/>
&gt; unschooling. I told her that I couldn&#39;t really help putting things about<br/>
&gt; real life into the article because radical unschooling is so much a part of<br/>
&gt; my life now. But I did say that I wouldn&#39;t accentuate the difference between<br/>
&gt; unschooling and radical unschooling or make radical unschooling the focus.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; _____________________________________________<br/>
&gt; What is Unschooling?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Watch how a baby learns to walk. They observe what others are doing, they<br/>
&gt; work their muscles and get them ready, their balance improves, and then<br/>
&gt; slowly as they are able they pull up and stand alone and take that first<br/>
&gt; step. They don&#39;t have a &quot;goal&quot; to walk. They don&#39;t decide that they will<br/>
&gt; walk and then make a plan to accomplish that goal. The baby&#39;s parents trust<br/>
&gt; that the baby will walk. They know they don&#39;t need to coerce, bribe or<br/>
&gt; otherwise entice their baby, because it&#39;s part of the baby&#39;s natural<br/>
&gt; tendency and genetic makeup to want to grow, to learn and to do what adults<br/>
&gt; do. All a parent needs to do is provide a safe place to move and<br/>
&gt; opportunities for the baby to stretch those muscles.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Watch how a 3 year old explores the world. Running from one thing to the<br/>
&gt; next, soaking it all in and asking Why? And What&#39;s that? At every turn.<br/>
&gt; Sometimes she stops for a moment to really focus on something. A blade of<br/>
&gt; grass can become the most facinating thing in the world, as she turns it<br/>
&gt; from side to side, watches it sway in the breeze, notices the little bug<br/>
&gt; perched on the end. And then her interest turns elsewhere- what is that bug,<br/>
&gt; what is it called, why is it moving that way, what sound does it make. But<br/>
&gt; the little one&#39;s attention doesn&#39;t stay on one thing for long, and she has<br/>
&gt; quickly run to the next thing. Was there no learning there? Was it all lost?<br/>
&gt; No, because she made a connection that will last a lifetime. The next time<br/>
&gt; she sees a bug or watches something move in the wind, she will remember what<br/>
&gt; she already learned and add to it. Every expreience builds on the ones<br/>
&gt; before it and slightly (or dramatically) changes her perception of the<br/>
&gt; world. The involved parent will answer her questions and get down on the<br/>
&gt; ground with her and explore and laugh and maybe point something out she<br/>
&gt; hadn&#39;t noticed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s easy to see this learning in babies learning to walk and talk and 3<br/>
&gt; year olds playing. Sometimes, it&#39;s harder to observe in older kids who may<br/>
&gt; not ask Why? 3000 times a day. And sometimes it&#39;s hard to imagine that<br/>
&gt; algebra and reading, manners and cleaning, the history of Rome and the<br/>
&gt; writing of Shakespeare could possibly be learned the same way. But that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; exactly how unschoolers learn. In fact, it&#39;s exactly how all people learn to<br/>
&gt; some extent. If you started making a list of all the things you&#39;ve learned<br/>
&gt; in your life, you may be surprised to find how many of those weren&#39;t learned<br/>
&gt; by rote memorization, textbooks, or someone coercing you or bribing you to<br/>
&gt; get it down long enough to take a test. The things that we learn that really<br/>
&gt; stick with us are the things we are interested in, that connect to other<br/>
&gt; things we know, when our brains are mature enough to grasp the concepts. We<br/>
&gt; learn while we are playing and enjoying what we&#39;re doing and the company of<br/>
&gt; those around us. And sometimes, we learn because we have a goal we want to<br/>
&gt; meet and we need to acquire certain knowledge or skills to attain that goal.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s hard to define unschooling in a pat, one paragraph dictionary<br/>
&gt; definition. There is no unschooling organization that&#39;s handing down<br/>
&gt; definitions and guidelines. No list of unschooling rules. It&#39;s a bit like<br/>
&gt; life in that way- we&#39;re all living life, but some people are just breathing<br/>
&gt; and taking up space. We can do things that lead toward a more fullfilling<br/>
&gt; life, a more peaceful life, better relationships and kinder actions. A life<br/>
&gt; that makes a difference in the world and a life that&#39;s lived for a purpose.<br/>
&gt; So, even though all of us learn some things in an natural way- those things<br/>
&gt; that we are interested in, those things that we love and those things we&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; chosen to learn to meet a goal- most people are not truly unschooling<br/>
&gt; themselves or their children (nor would most claim to be, of course!). We<br/>
&gt; can do things that lead towards more natural learning and peaceful living.<br/>
&gt; We can let go of those things that are getting in the way of the<br/>
&gt; relationships between ourselves and our children. We can trust that our<br/>
&gt; children were designed with an innate desire to learn, an inborn curiosity<br/>
&gt; and a drive to explore the world around them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sometimes it&#39;s easier to define something in terms of what it&#39;s not,<br/>
&gt; especially with something like unschooling that is surrounded by many<br/>
&gt; misconceptions and myths. Unschooling is not educational neglect. It&#39;s not<br/>
&gt; leaving a child to his own devices to figure out the world with no guidance.<br/>

I really like the descripton of the 3 yo.  <br/>
I read the whole thing and that&#39;s not too common for me with articles describing unschooling these days, but it was to the point. Not too wordy.<br/>
Didn&#39;t notice any typo&#39;s.<br/>
I&#39;m going to share it with a new homeschooling friend I have.<br/>

&gt; &gt; It&#39;s easy to see this learning in babies learning to walk and talk and 3 year olds playing.  Sometimes, it&#39;s harder to observe in older kids who may not ask Why? 3000 times a day.   And sometimes it&#39;s hard to imagine that algebra and reading, manners and cleaning, the history of Rome and the writing of Shakespeare could possibly be learned the same way.  But that&#39;s exactly how unschoolers learn.  In fact, it&#39;s exactly how all people learn to some extent.  If you started making a list of all the things you&#39;ve learned in your life, you may be surprised to find how many of those weren&#39;t learned by rote memorization, textbooks, or someone coercing you or bribing you to get it down long enough to take a test.  The things that we learn that really stick with us are the things we are interested in, that connect to other things we know, when our brains are mature enough to grasp the concepts.  We learn while we are playing and enjoying what we&#39;re doing and the company of those around us.  And sometimes, we learn because we have a goal we want to meet and we need to acquire certain knowledge or skills to attain that goal. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; It&#39;s hard to define unschooling in a pat, one paragraph dictionary definition.  There is no unschooling organization that&#39;s handing down definitions and guidelines.  No list of unschooling rules.  It&#39;s a bit like life in that way- we&#39;re all living life, but some people are just breathing and taking up space.  We can do things that lead toward a more fullfilling life, a more peaceful life, better relationships and kinder actions.  A life that makes a difference in the world and a life that&#39;s lived for a purpose.  So, even though all of us learn some things in an natural way- those things that we are interested in, those things that we love and those things we&#39;ve chosen to learn to meet a goal- most people are not truly unschooling themselves or their children (nor would most claim to be, of course!).  We can do things that lead towards more natural learning and peaceful living.  We can let go of those things that are getting in the way of the relationships between ourselves and our children.  We can trust that our children were designed with an innate desire to learn, an inborn curiosity and a drive to explore the world around them.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Sometimes it&#39;s easier to define something in terms of what it&#39;s not, especially with something like unschooling that is surrounded by many misconceptions and myths.  Unschooling is not educational neglect.  It&#39;s not leaving a child to his own devices to figure out the world with no guidance.  It&#39;s not passive or apathtic or careless.  On the other hand, guidance, being actively involved and caring is not the same as unit stuides or following interests after school work is done or &quot;making learning fun.&quot;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Learning is fun!  It&#39;s doesn&#39;t have to be manipulated to be enjoyable.  And all of a child&#39;s interests have real life application, because they are living real life right now, this moment.  Unit studies and curriculum have the purpose of pouring information into empty vessels.  Sometimes through force, coersion and rote memorization and sometimes through more benign means of sneaking math facts into play.  The unschooler recognizes that learning and life are not separate.  That there is already math in play.  That life is not a set of subjects, but rather that it&#39;s bits and pieces of information and experience that all flow together.  And as a person lives life, they cannot help but be immersed in that information and experience and it becomes a part of who they are.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Unschooling is a partnership between a parent and child.  The unschooling parent knows that her child is a unique person, with unique gifts, talents and interests.  That she will have her own desires for her life and her own ideas about how to fulfil those desires.  And the parent trusts that her child will learn and grow and mature without bribery or coercion.  She makes an interesting life for her child, with lots of opportunities for her child to see, hear, taste, touch, and smell new things.  She explores the world with her child and they learn together.  She&#39;s present and aware, commited to being with her child in the moment.  She points things out and shares information, but not with the ulterior motive of teaching as if she were writing on a blank slate.  Instead she shares information with her child the same way she would share it with her friend.  Because it&#39;s exciting and important and she wants to connect with that person.<br/>

&gt; My friend runs a local homeschooling website and part of it is &quot;Teaching Methods&quot; where she has a list of all the different homeschooling styles. She asked me to write an article on unschooling.  I&#39;m putting it here, before I send the final product to her, because I&#39;d like some feedback.  Please feel free to let me know if you notice any spelling or grammar errors.  I used to write all the time, was in AP English in highschool etc., but the last few years all the writing I&#39;ve done has been for email lists and message boards.  I&#39;m embarrassed to say that the quality reflects that.  :(  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh, also, my friend wanted me to focus on academic unschooling, not radical unschooling.  I told her that I couldn&#39;t really help putting things about real life into the article because radical unschooling is so much a part of my life now.  But I did say that I wouldn&#39;t accentuate the difference between unschooling and radical unschooling or make radical unschooling the focus.  <br/>

&gt; _____________________________________________<br/>
&gt; What is Unschooling?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Watch how a baby learns to walk.  They observe what others are doing, they work their muscles and get them ready, their balance improves, and then slowly as they are able they pull up and stand alone and take that first step.  They don&#39;t have a &quot;goal&quot; to walk.  They don&#39;t decide that they will walk and then make a plan to accomplish that goal.  The baby&#39;s parents trust that the baby will walk.  They know they don&#39;t need to coerce, bribe or otherwise entice their baby, because it&#39;s part of the baby&#39;s natural tendency and genetic makeup to want to grow, to learn and to do what adults do.  All a parent needs to do is provide a safe place to move and opportunities for the baby to stretch those muscles.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Watch how a 3 year old explores the world.  Running from one thing to the next, soaking it all in and asking Why? And What&#39;s that? At every turn.  Sometimes she stops for a moment to really focus on something.  A blade of grass can become the most facinating thing in the world, as she turns it from side to side, watches it sway in the breeze, notices the little bug perched on the end.  And then her interest turns elsewhere- what is that bug, what is it called, why is it moving that way, what sound does it make.  But the little one&#39;s attention doesn&#39;t stay on one thing for long, and she has quickly run to the next thing.  Was there no learning there?  Was it all lost?  No, because she made a connection that will last a lifetime.  The next time she sees a bug or watches something move in the wind, she will remember what she already learned and add to it.  Every expreience builds on the ones before it and slightly (or dramatically) changes her perception of the world.   The involved parent will answer her questions and get down on the ground with her and explore and laugh and maybe point something out she hadn&#39;t noticed. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s easy to see this learning in babies learning to walk and talk and 3 year olds playing.  Sometimes, it&#39;s harder to observe in older kids who may not ask Why? 3000 times a day.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1049535646">-=- I don&#39;t have any suggestions for you, but I really liked this  <br/>
piece of writing and am hoping you will offer the link to the website  <br/>
where the finished product will appear?-=-<br/>
<br/>
-=-This will be great to give my family when they start asking  <br/>
questions! It&#39;s a perfect article to pass on to people to &quot;educate&quot;  <br/>
them on unschooling-=-<br/>
<br/>
Before anyone gives that article to anybody, maybe wait for the next  <br/>
revision.  There were typos and some unclarity.  I wrote a long post  <br/>
on the side.<br/>
<br/>
The article is for a particular list and purpose, and a link to that  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be the greatest use of this list.  It&#39;s for a local website  <br/>
for HOMEschoolers.  It&#39;s a description of unschooling for the purpose  <br/>
(I think; I could be wrong) of defending it from criticism from within  <br/>
a local homeschooling group.   (So that might be worth sharing with  <br/>
some kinds of relatives, true. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
So Emily, when it&#39;s at the stage that you&#39;re ready for it to be  <br/>
published on that other site, could you bring your final version here  <br/>
or link to it?  That would probably be a better one for people to  <br/>
share with their relatives.  Thanks.<br/>

<br/>
Maybe rethink this line, which could alienate some readers. No-one wants to<br/>
think of themselves like this.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe something about no need for testing or quizzing - the learning being<br/>
internal, yet over time becomes obvious because the kids are engaged in<br/>
their interests???<br/>
<br/>
Maybe more about the learner being in the real world, with other mentors and<br/>
competence models. This does seem to focus on the very young.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m being picky because you asked for feedback. I think it is a good,<br/>
unintimidating article that makes unschooling sound attractive and doable,<br/>
even if it does skim the surface, as we who are living it know.<br/>
