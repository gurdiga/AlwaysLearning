<div id="ygrps-yiv-430702051">A Google search turned up a fair amount of John Holt&#39;s writings at<br/>
different locations.<br/>
A new Holtie could get a taste of what he was trying to express.  Beware,<br/>
the TCS site has &quot; The Dark Side of John Holt&quot;  oooooweeeeoooo...  <br/>
mostly commentary on some Holt writings - interpreted to be dissing<br/>
children.  And Home taught, is that Bridget?,  only had a few quotes<br/>
which were being dissected as a means to prove unschooling wouldn&#39;t work.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Google search &quot;John Holt&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Deb L, googling way too early.</div>
