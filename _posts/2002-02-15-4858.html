&lt;&lt;  It seems every one of them listens to classical music for enjoyment and <br/>
enrichment. My parents also listened exclusively to classical music. Well, I <br/>
just don&#39;t enjoy it at all. Sometimes when I hear it, it actually gets on my <br/>
nerves instead of having this soothing, calming effect that others may get <br/>
out of it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
For me that would be modern or progressive jazz.  Jazz for dancing, or <br/>
dixieland doesn&#39;t affect my heart or brain in that bad way.<br/>
<br/>
We rarely have classical on here.  My husband will listen to it on his own, <br/>
sometimes.  And we own a fair amount.  But what I DO like is Baroque.  <br/>
There&#39;s a huge difference between baroque and classical musically.  I don&#39;t <br/>
like Beethoven either.  I do Love Bach, and Telemann.  And I like a lot of <br/>
medieval and Renaissance stuff--especially dance music and counterpoint vocal.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s not treated as glory-stuff.  My kids are familiar with Herman&#39;s <br/>
Hermits (Marty discovered them, thinking he had heard a Beatles song he&#39;d <br/>
never heard before, and I found an Australian album with 26 songs or so, and <br/>
that&#39;s been their Herman&#39;s Hermits standard), and John Denver, and Queen.  <br/>
Passively (the same way they&#39;re familiar with Baroque) they hear Billy Joel, <br/>
Carol King, Jethro Tull, various stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
Musicals are more overt.<br/>
<br/>
Weird Al is a shared passion.<br/>
Monty Python Sings is common to all.<br/>
<br/>
Marty likes Gorillaz and Nickelback.  Kirby likes &quot;filk&quot; kind of stuff, about <br/>
Elf Quest or gaming or fantasy.<br/>
<br/>
The exposure, to gain familiarity and so that they CAN choose what they like <br/>
without having their friends tell them what to like is important for me.  And <br/>
we sing at our house, so access to more songs is good.  Holly&#39;s liking rounds <br/>
lately.  I&#39;ve always liked traditional kids&#39; songs, and ballads.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1535997164">&lt;&lt;For example, playing classical music in order to &quot;enrich&quot; my child&#39;s life rather than singing along with the Beattle&#39;s and telling my kids things that I know about them and their music, because I&#39;m more familiar with the Beattle&#39;s than with classical.  I&#39;m not sure that we can really say that one of those activities would be more enriching than the other.  I do believe that classical music has value and we do listen to it as well, but is it really more &quot;enriching&quot; than modern popular music?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is one of the reasons why I often feel so different from others in my homeschool group (other than being the only unschooler). It seems every one of them listens to classical music for enjoyment and enrichment. My parents also listened exclusively to classical music. Well, I just don&#39;t enjoy it at all. Sometimes when I hear it, it actually gets on my nerves instead of having this soothing, calming effect that others may get out of it. I know it is supposed to be a cultured, sophisticated thing to like and listen to classical music and that makes me feel all the more uncultured and unsophisticated sometimes. I&#39;ll take the Beatles any day over Beethoven.<br/>
<br/>
BUT, I have listened to it somewhat for the sake of my kids, to expose them to it in case they might enjoy it. Especially when they were younger (to introduce their young, innocent minds to GREAT music) We even go to all the Symphony for the Schools programs put out by our local symphony. So far, my kids also prefer Beatles over Beethoven. And that&#39;s just fine with me!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We like music.  Lots of music, but not so much country and not so much<br/>
jazz.<br/>
<br/>
Dylan likes Camille Saint-Saens The Carnival of the Animals.   He likes<br/>
Mozart.<br/>
He loves Billie Holiday and Etta James,  Bob Dylan,  Eric Clapton, Stevie<br/>
Ray Vaughan and Keb Mo.  He listens to Peter Paul and Mary, the Beatles<br/>
and the Mama&#39;s and the Papa&#39;s.   He likes Beethoven.   He loves Carl<br/>
Orff&#39;s Carmina Burana which he hums or sings LOUDLY, usually making up<br/>
his own words, until we just have to go outside to get away from him. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 He likes the old Scottish and Welsh songs my aunt Eula used to sing to<br/>
me, the one&#39;s I can remember anyway, to sing to him.   He likes Sitar<br/>
music.  He likes Nat King Cole.  And he&#39;ll sit down and watch a Doris Day<br/>
movie with me.   He likes Charlie Parker.  Maybe he likes everything.  <br/>

Good for Dylan.  He&#39;s ahead of me. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And he doesn&#39;t have kids at school telling him what NOT to like.<br/>

Good for him.<br/>

plays in a alternative/indie rock band. She&#39;s grown up listening to <br/>
the likes of The Red Hot Chili Peppers, Massive Attack, The <br/>
Prodigy, David Bowie, Led Zeppelin, Spiritualized, etc. Her first <br/>
concert  was Glastonbury (a music festival in the UK) at the age <br/>
of 11 months. I&#39;m also into Celtic music, some operas (like <br/>
Carmena Burana - sp?), acid jazz, rave, and musicals. The only <br/>
music forms I usually don&#39;t particularly care for are country and <br/>
freeform jazz. Some of the music Tamzin likes is:  Abba (a lot!), <br/>
The Beatles, Aqua (the song Barbie Girl in particular!), Enya, <br/>
lullabies, Carmena Burana, and at the moment she&#39;s hot on the <br/>
soundtrack to Shrek.<br/>
<br/>
Hey Sandra,<br/>
have you heard of the Medieval Babes? If not, let me know and I&#39;ll <br/>
burn a CD and send it to you. I think you&#39;d like them.<br/>

blanket to blanket being fed. And dancing :-) She went to the Lilith Fair<br/>
at 4 or 5....<br/>
<br/>
She had a major Bowie phase, too, and likes Abba and the Beatles,<br/>

Tamzin&#39;s been to about 10 or so festivals, all in her first 6 years <br/>
of life! They have a lot of festivals in the UK during the summer <br/>
months. Because the UK is so small (size wise, compared to <br/>
the USA) it&#39;s a lot easier to travel and go to different festivals. I <br/>
miss the festivals  :-(<br/>
What&#39;s the Lilith Fair?  Also when and where? <br/>
Does anyone know of other festivals in Northern California, <br/>
Northern Nevada, or Southern Oregon?<br/>
<br/>
Tamzin&#39;s into musicals as well. She loves The Sound of Music, <br/>
The King and I, Hair, and Godspell. The latter two she&#39;s only <br/>
heard the music from, not seen the films. She also likes the <br/>
music from Tommy and Bye Bye Birdie. She&#39;s also been into The <br/>
Nutcracker music since she saw the ballet in December. And as <br/>
you all know, she&#39;s got a Shirley Temple thing going. She got a <br/>
keyboard from her dad for Xmas and it has a 100 tune song <br/>
bank. Now she quite often has a &#39;soundtrack&#39; to her games &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
