<div id="ygrps-yiv-629384106"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;I&#39;m sorry I had such a strong reaction in the first place.  There had been several instances in the past week and some of people grasping for odd reasons to &quot;prove to me&quot; that unschooling wasn&#39;t working, and I was having a weary moment.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sandra must be the Energizer Bunny. I don&#39;t have as much interest in<br/>
responding to food threads. The simple concept of monkey platters is<br/>
lot of inspiration to go on and experiment with. Here are the links<br/>
again:<br/>

Sandra even had a festival on the theme of monkey platters:<br/>

There&#39;s lots more about eating on Sandra&#39;s website: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/food">http://sandradodd.com/food</a><br/>
<br/>
Questions about food, such as which kinds and how much and what&#39;s<br/>
healthy are personal preferences and opinions which really can&#39;t be<br/>
answered very directly by unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Other than to say offer don&#39;t refuse. That&#39;s my saying to counter<br/>
sayings like &quot;don&#39;t offer-don&#39;t refuse&quot; and other ideas we wouldn&#39;t<br/>
want leveled at ourselves but that children are often at the mercy of.<br/>
Be generous. Treat children as special guests and revered friends not<br/>
adjuncts to or extensions of parents.<br/>
<br/>
Any time this list is about what&#39;s healthy or how much or exactly what<br/>
to feed children, it&#39;s easy to mix food ideas into the unschooling and<br/>
make decisions about eating apply to the unschooling itself. Sometimes<br/>
that confuses issues and has readers thinking that decisions about<br/>
eating are decisions about unschooling-- which they are on an<br/>
individual level. On the larger level of an unschooling list though,<br/>
the discussion about eating can&#39;t honestly be a poll about how to eat<br/>
right or well or better or whatever someone&#39;s goal for eating is.<br/>
<br/>
The confusion about what the list is for --unschooling discussion--<br/>
often confounds list discussions which include talk of food or<br/>
sleeping or routines, and then quickly devolve into some sort of bid<br/>
for a poll or vote on what&#39;s the thing the original poster is to do.<br/>
Coming to a consensus about personal preferences is not what this list<br/>
is about.<br/>
<br/>
Someone said something not too long ago asking about how to unschool<br/>
food. That&#39;s an odd phrase. It isn&#39;t the food that gets unschooled.<br/>
Putting it that way seems to me like shorthand for &quot;making unschooling<br/>
agree with parental food ideas.&quot; And from everything I&#39;ve read which<br/>
says how unschooling works, that really isn&#39;t what unschooling is.<br/>
