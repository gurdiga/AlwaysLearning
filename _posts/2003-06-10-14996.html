[to some friend of mine long ago &lt;g&gt;]<br/>
<br/>
I’m about to become the editor of a small, established homeschoolers’ <br/>
newsletter.  It was started by people who were on Prodigy having a great time <br/>
wrestling ideas, insulting each other, and making up.    Prodigy raised their rates <br/>
a huge amount (mine would’ve gone from $18 to $250 a month, for instance) by <br/>
charging hourly for what had been an open bulletin board, so we all bailed at <br/>
once.  The woman who took the newsletter isn’t enjoying it, and basically <br/>
producing a sad little dud, so I’ve been called in to jazz it up and save it.  One <br/>
problem is its name.  It’s called:<br/>
Home Educators’ Computer Companion (HECC)<br/>
The Prodigious Backyard Fence.<br/>
<br/>
I’m going to switch it around and emphasize “Backyard Fence” and eventually <br/>
dump all but that.  People can’t cheer for a team they can’t pronounce, and <br/>
the “computer” bit discourages non-geeks from subscribing.  There are several <br/>
Christian fundamentalists involved, but they’ll either develop some tolerance <br/>
and humor or they’ll wander off and the heathen intellectuals will have won <br/>
one small piece of the homeschooling battle.  I’m going to try to get them to <br/>
think and interract without running them off.  It will be an exercise in <br/>
diplomacy and integrity, which is about the only kind of exercise I’ve been getting <br/>
lately.<br/>
<br/>
On my third attempt (third occasional attempt, over a nine-month period) I <br/>
finally got the New Mexico state department of education to send me something <br/>
one of their hot-shots bragged we could get for nothing.  I was supposed to ask <br/>
for “Essential Competencies.”  What I have received is “New Mexico Competency <br/>
Frameworks.”  It’s the state’s plan (derived after much expense--committee <br/>
meetings all around the state, advice of experts, etc.) to take another route <br/>
from the essential competencies, which I don’t mind.  They claim frameworks are <br/>
better than competencies!  I guess I believe it!  Competencies produce 70% <br/>
mastery, while frameworks are 100% successful!  Competencies produce losers and <br/>
winners, while frameworks produce only winners!  Competencies produce <br/>
successful programs, while frameworks produce successful students!  If I could find my <br/>
diploma I would kiss the “English” part and laud myself for not having <br/>
majored in Education.  They took 18 pages (I subtracted title pages and credits) to <br/>
say things like “thinking is necessary for communication, and communication <br/>
improves your thinking.”  (I clarified that from a half page of “Reading, <br/>
writing, speaking and listening are social, interactive processes intertwined with <br/>
thinking.  Reading writing, speaking and listening are the fundamental skills <br/>
of communication…” and so forth.   But it’s not all text!  They have charts! <br/>
 They have graphs!  They have Visual Representations of Performance-Based <br/>
Assessment Models!  What a waste of paper and energy and postage.<br/>
<br/>
I meant to ask if you were planning more children, but I figure if you have <br/>
another baby I’ll get an announcement like I did the last…<br/>
HEY!<br/>
<br/>
I have three kids who are potty trained and who all talk.  No more infants, <br/>
ever, I hope.  (At least not out of me.)  The hair report is like this:  <br/>
Holly’s is a cross between Peggy Fleming and Joan of Arc.  Marty has a barber cut <br/>
which he made shorter with scissors for practice.  Kirby has a ratty Beatle <br/>
front and the whole back end is nearly to his waist.  I still have the <br/>
straight-to-the-waist, occasionally braided hippy-do.  Keith just lately went from hair <br/>
past his shoulders to a style cut (cousin of Bill Clinton’s) at my nagging <br/>
request, because I don’t want Honeywell to fire him for a pony tail.  (Oh!  I <br/>
forgot!  They can’t fire people for pony tails…)  We are a very unmatched set.<br/>
<br/>

END OF HISTORICAL STROLL...<br/>
--------------<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so glad people don&#39;t have to wait for paper homeschooling newsletters <br/>
anymore!  <br/>
(some do, but most don&#39;t have to)<br/>
<br/>
I enjoyed the mini-rant on the competencies framework.  I had forgotten all <br/>
about that.<br/>
