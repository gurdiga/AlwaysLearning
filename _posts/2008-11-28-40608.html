<div id="ygrps-yiv-1901854587">Meg (ransomenote@...) sent me a link to something big and important.   <br/>
It&#39;s an article in the NYTimes and it&#39;s apparently longer on the  <br/>
webpage than it was in print (A version of this article appeared in  <br/>
print on November 23, 2008, on page MM48 of the New York edition.)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a quote, where they&#39;re talking about video editing, for fun,  <br/>
at home:<br/>
<br/>
-=-The real achievement in this subculture is to win the Iron Editor  <br/>
challenge. Just as in the TV cookoff contest �Iron Chef,� the Iron  <br/>
Editor must remix videos in real time in front of an audience while  <br/>
competing with other editors to demonstrate superior visual literacy.  <br/>
The best editors can remix video as fast as you might type.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One thing I&#39;ve said several times over the years is that kids who use  <br/>
instant messages (now more often phone texting, but I noticed it when  <br/>
so many kids were IMing) are doing something that isn&#39;t taught or  <br/>
done at all in school, and that is using the written word in real  <br/>
time.  Speaking as someone who taught English for several years, I  <br/>
know the closest things are passing notes in class (disruptive and  <br/>
discouraged) or short-answer tests (not really communication in a  <br/>
dialog way).  In typewriter days, and even early online text  <br/>
communication days (e-mail and bulletin boards), people had plenty of  <br/>
chance to proofread, and they would go away and wait maybe hours or  <br/>
days before getting a response.<br/>
<br/>
The article linked here is talking about the same sort of thing,  <br/>
using computer editing tools and then uploading videos to YouTube,  <br/>
where other people post their own versions (maybe of the same thing  <br/>
that poster worked with, and maybe a new variant on what was just  <br/>
posted).   And she goes on to talk about movie editing, and the  <br/>
future of the searchability of images.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the next paragraph is my commentary, not about the article  <br/>
directly:<br/>
<br/>
The article also talks about what was valued and planned upon and  <br/>
around before books were the big thing, and that was the spoken  <br/>
word.  People used to listen!  After dinner, when it was too dark to  <br/>
go out and maybe too early to sleep, people told stories and sang  <br/>
songs--LONG songs.  I know many of those traditional ballads, but  <br/>
even in the context of a medieval studies group where they have after  <br/>
dinner times and fires and late-night campfires, they don&#39;t have the  <br/>
skills to listen very well.  Keith and I have gone prepared with  <br/>
longer more serious (or funny, but still long) songs just in case  <br/>
there&#39;s good reception (among the people there) and also some short  <br/>
slapstick rude humor in case they aren&#39;t able to listen.   But it&#39;s a  <br/>
lost art in general.    The stories we know as &quot;fairy tales&quot; were  <br/>
called &quot;household tales&quot; in German, and they weren&#39;t about fairies  <br/>
much at all, but were stories about the old days, and fantasy places,  <br/>
and what might&#39;ve happened in a non-specified time out in the woods  <br/>
there, not so far away.<br/>
<br/>
The timeline for change is steep and fast now, and it&#39;s another  <br/>
reminder that we can&#39;t prepare our children for what they need to  <br/>
know in ten years.  We can let them explore and discover, and makes  <br/>
sure they have access to what others are discovering, and tools to  <br/>
play with!<br/>
