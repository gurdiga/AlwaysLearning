<div id="ygrps-yiv-620242447">Dear All,<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I was reading an article in a magazine - interview with <br/>
Mark J. Penn, author of Microtrends.  Penn is the one who <br/>
coined &quot;Soccer Mom&quot; during one of Bill Clinton&#39;s political <br/>
campaigns.  Penn&#39;s theory is that you don&#39;t need trends to become <br/>
big; the era of mega-trends is over, and small groups making a <br/>
choice can have great impact.  He has observed that the small, under-<br/>
the-radar groups after often those who tip an election, redefine a <br/>
technology or trigger a social movement.  And one percent of the <br/>
population is usually sufficient.<br/>
<br/>
I was just pondering if unschoolers are getting to that crucial mass <br/>
(if you believe in it) and how this social movement will affect the <br/>
remainder of the society.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts?<br/>
<br/>
Kind regards,<br/>

combination of reasons, including time passing) less crazy/exotic, it opens up the field for <br/>
similar things.<br/>
<br/>
I saw it with the SCA.  In the 1970&#39;s it was seen as goofy and wasteful; kind of interesting, <br/>
but done by nuts.   Now 35, 40 years later, there are huge professional Renaissance fairs <br/>
and LOTS of very specialized historical re-enactment and research groups.  Some group <br/>
had to try it and take the flak, and then it was easier for others.<br/>
<br/>
Once, speaking at a conference, I acted it out by walking to the far side of the room (my <br/>
right front) and saying &quot;Here&#39;s school,&quot; and walking toward the middle and saying &quot;here&#39;s  <br/>
homeschooling, school at home&quot; and walking all the way to the other wall and saying <br/>
&quot;Here I am, being very radical, and so if I don&#39;t get in trouble, that opens up all this <br/>
(indicating the space between school-at-home and where I was.<br/>
<br/>
When I was pregnant with Marty I had no intention of having the birth at the HMO where <br/>
I&#39;d lost all influence over how Kirby&#39;s birth went.  I was active with what was then called <br/>
the Cesarean Prevention Movement.    I and another officer of the group used to go in for <br/>
my checkups and push the envelope.  I would ask for the very maximum concessions.  I <br/>
asked the head of obstetrics to sign off on a very extreme set of agreements.  We went <br/>
prepared with statistics and research.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t for my personal sake.  It wasn&#39;t about Marty.  It was about all the other moms  <br/>
who would come in and ask for some milder concession.  Having really considered <br/>
whether and how they could concede to a BIG change, conceding to small changes was <br/>
easy.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was in my teens and twenties during the &quot;Women&#39;s Liberation&quot; days, the beginnings of <br/>
Ms. magazine, the serious social upheavals being created by that.  Some of their greatest <br/>
resistance came from women who didn&#39;t want the boat rocked.   Part of the boat rocking <br/>
consisted simply of one thing:   The clear message that they had a choice.<br/>
<br/>
When a person feels she has no choice whatsoever, she finds ways to accept her arranged <br/>
marriage, unwished-for pregnancies, mean husband, interference of her parents in her <br/>
adult life, bottle-feeding babies and leaving them to cry, sending them to school without <br/>
wondering whether it was good or not.  &quot;No choice.&quot;  That&#39;s just the way it is.<br/>
<br/>
When someone not only convincingly says &quot;It could be different,&quot; but PROVES it, the <br/>
comfortable cooperative-victimhood (What&#39;s the word for that??) of millions dissolves.  <br/>
<br/>
By keeping my children home, it is clear to every other family in this cul-de-sac that they <br/>
have sent their children to school by choice.<br/>
<br/>
Choice is power.  Powerlessness can be comfort, though.  We remove their comfort.<br/>

Others here don&#39;t know, though...<br/>
<br/>
After I wrote about my ideas of hiring people based on what they did  <br/>
as hobbies, Lauren wrote to me saying she was in the SCA too &quot;in  <br/>
another life&quot; (she&#39;s not in now) and we exchanged a few e-mails about  <br/>
that.  She&#39;s of the same rank I am in the group.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m about to go off topic, except for the philosophical aspect of  <br/>
paving the way for others, so skipping the rest won&#39;t hurt anyone&#39;s  <br/>
quest to understand unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
-=-And these days, we&#39;re increasingly seeing women who adopt this  <br/>

<br/>
Well...<br/>
<br/>
The hospital didn&#39;t know I was planning a home birth.  When they  <br/>
found out I wasn&#39;t coming in for the birth, I got a phone call  <br/>
offering for the HMO (which was at the time one and the same with the  <br/>
hospital) to pay for any doctor in town I wanted, if I would tell  <br/>
them which doctor I had transferred to.  I said no thanks, that&#39;s  <br/>
fine, I&#39;ve changed insurance (true; the end of the year was nearly  <br/>
there and we switched our insurance where Keith worked in case I  <br/>
ended up at the county/university hospital, which I did, which was  <br/>
fine).<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t want to say I was using a midwife, because it was illegal  <br/>
for midwives to help VBACs in those days here, and so those who did  <br/>
so weren&#39;t registered to be midwives.  That way they couldn&#39;t lose  <br/>
their licenses, because they didn&#39;t have any.<br/>
<br/>
The morning Marty was born, my sister called the HMO hospital and  <br/>
asked to speak to me.  It was maybe six hours after the birth, maybe  <br/>
eight.   The person who answered the phone at the maternity desk told  <br/>
my sister &quot;She&#39;s at UNM.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hmmmm....<br/>
<br/>
They were keeping a close eye on me!! &lt;g&gt;  Nurses maybe worked in  <br/>
both places?  Someone knew, somehow.<br/>
<br/>
I had gone to a doctor at the other hospital so I&#39;d have a file in  <br/>
case I went in unplanned (as we did, though I guess I had prepared by  <br/>
getting into their records, which is planning of a sort).   The  <br/>
doctor at county/university said &quot;We could do a VBAC, and I said it&#39;s  <br/>
against your policies; I didn&#39;t come in in the first five months (or  <br/>
whatever it had been), and she said, Yeah, still.   And that was good  <br/>
to know for our organizational fact-finding!!<br/>
<br/>
So was/is that activism by moms about cesarean births a microtrend?   <br/>
Did it make differences in the way hospitals approached things?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I had a similar situation, though I didn&#39;t do it with the cognizance you<br/>
did. I planned a home birth for my third with no medical backup using<br/>
illegal midwife. When I was a week and a half &quot;overdue&quot; Hannah flipped<br/>
upside down and upon inspection the midwife said Hannah was fully breech and<br/>
midwife could not deliver the baby at home. I called an obstetrician who was<br/>
sympathetic to home-birthers, particularly the Amish. He agree to see me and<br/>
attempt a vaginal delivery...in the hospital, and if the breech looked safe.<br/>
An ultrasound showed Hannah&#39;s cute little ten toes right there at the cervix<br/>
and he said, &quot;C-section. Tomorrow.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My first two were born with midwives in a birthing center, and I had<br/>
complete control of those situations. The moment the doctor called this<br/>
shot, I knew I was in the warzone.<br/>
<br/>
I knew I had to have the baby in the hospital, and by C-section, and I came<br/>
to terms pretty quickly with that (5% of double footling breeches delivered<br/>
vaginally supposedly don&#39;t make it). I knew I couldn&#39;t take that chance. But<br/>
I could not lose control as happens in the hospital.<br/>
<br/>
I admitted myself the next day with my husband (who was a medical student at<br/>
the time, and that was a bit of an issue in itself...the medical &quot;system&quot; is<br/>
tight with GREAT control over its doctors and students). I told the med<br/>
staff that I would try the C-section with minimal pain medication and<br/>
increase it only as I said I needed, the baby would be taken out and given<br/>
directly to my husband with no cleaning, wiping, etc., the baby would stay<br/>
with me for my entire stay there, and I would discharge myself the next day<br/>
if I wanted to. The nurse said &quot;no&quot;. I got up and said I was leaving. She<br/>
stopped me and said I should talk to the doctors involved...pediatrician,<br/>
obstetrician, anesthesiologist. Each one came in and said &quot;no&quot;. Each time I<br/>
got up to leave. Each time they conceded. I had minimal medication, the baby<br/>
was given to dh right away and stayed with me the whole time, even through<br/>
the night sleeping in my bed, and I discharged myself the next day, signing<br/>
the AMA (against medical advice) form.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t realize it at the time, (I was just going on instinct), but this<br/>
story HAS served Hannah and my sons since it has been told a couple of<br/>
times, and they&#39;ve had a chance to know an example of standing up for one&#39;s<br/>
rights, of questioning authority when authority doesn&#39;t make sense, and<br/>
protecting one&#39;s self or another person with strength.<br/>

The ob/gyn gave me that statistic at the time. Don&#39;t know how accurate it<br/>
