<div id="ygrps-yiv-1441693806">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
My local libary, like a few around the country, is sponsoring a <br/>
lecture/film series called Research Revolution. Here&#39;s a link:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://library.humboldt.edu/resrev/">http://library.humboldt.edu/resrev/</a><br/>
<br/>
If you check out the links for each event, there&#39;s an essay, a <br/>
reading list, links, and a list of videos and tv shows. Some great, <br/>
fun videos that connect things up are on the lists.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t come here and read as often as I&#39;d like, but want to let you <br/>
all know how much you contribute to my family&#39;s enjoyment of <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
