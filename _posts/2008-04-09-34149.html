<div id="ygrps-yiv-278887548">I just watched Alfie Kohn&#39;s video based on his book, &quot;Unconditional<br/>
Parenting.&quot;  He&#39;s got me hooked.  I&#39;m going to check out the actual book<br/>
from the library tomorrow, and stop using punishments/rewards/praise ASAP!<br/>
My question is this:  For those of you (most of you, I assume) who do not<br/>
punish/reward/praise, how do you draw the line between practicing this<br/>
&quot;parenting with&quot; style (as Kohn calls it) and being a permissive parent,<br/>
letting them do whatever they want?  Any suggestions/advice on how to<br/>
implement this in real life?<br/>
<br/>
Do you really NEVER have to punish/reward/praise?  Or is it more about a<br/>
change in how you look at each situation?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You *help* them do what they want.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes you may need to think beyond the immediate request to  <br/>
figure out what they&#39;re really asking for so that you can find a safe  <br/>
substitute or a better time.<br/>
<br/>
Specific examples of when you feel you need to punish will help  <br/>
people make it clearer. But, for example, a child running in a  <br/>
crowded store doesn&#39;t need to run right there, but he is telling you  <br/>
he&#39;s full of energy and needs a break to get that energy expended in  <br/>
a better location. If it happens often, then the whole situation  <br/>
needs better planning and perhaps rethought. (But that&#39;s really to  <br/>
vague to be helpful which is why real examples are better. It&#39;s often  <br/>
*why* something is happening that&#39;s important, not what.)<br/>
<br/>
Celebrating along with them when they&#39;ve accomplished something they  <br/>
were trying to achieve for their own sakes is great :-) Rewarding  <br/>
them and praising them for doing what you want feels like training a  <br/>
dog. Rewards should come from a sense of accomplishment, not from  <br/>
some external source.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about trusting that they want to be good people and in the mean  <br/>
time helping them get what they want in ways that are physically and  <br/>
socially safe to them and others.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Would you &quot;punish&quot; your friend for doing something that you didn&#39;t like, or would you <br/>
have a talk with them and explain what you didn&#39;t like and why, and in the process maybe <br/>
find out why they thought it was a good idea, and how could they express that idea in a <br/>
way that would work?<br/>
<br/>
When you move out of the &quot;behavioral&quot; mindset, the need to punish evaporates.  Trust is <br/>
the key ingredient--you trust that your child wants to have positive interactions in the <br/>
world--just like you do.  You trust that they are capable of creating those interactions.  <br/>
Sometimes they will need help from parents, who are in a great position to be a trusted <br/>
ally if a child believes you are really on their side.<br/>
<br/>
Punishment doesn&#39;t teach--contrary to popular parenting advice.  Think about times that <br/>
you were punished as a child.  Did you want connection, communication and <br/>
understanding, or did you want isolation?  Which situation is more conducive to learning, <br/>
assuming that learning is the real objective?<br/>
<br/>
We NEVER punish/reward/praise.  But what we do is celebrate, talk, hug & cuddle.  Some <br/>
of us take our own &quot;time outs&quot; (completely self-determined when one of us needs to <br/>
regroup).  It can sound like things are always smooth and &quot;perfect,&quot; but they arent.  The <br/>
kids still argue sometimes, and have misunderstandings--although less as they get older.  <br/>
My dd (9) is quicker to fly off the handle than the rest of us--more passionate and volatile <br/>
all around--and is learning all the time how to deal with herself.  She&#39;s the one who will <br/>
take herself out of the picture now.  She likes to be alone when she&#39;s really upset, and then <br/>
she&#39;ll usually come back refreshed and ready to interact again.  <br/>
<br/>
But things aren&#39;t &quot;controlled&quot; by me--although I mediate when someone asks me to or if <br/>
things are emotionally spiraling beyond what the kids can handle.  The focus is always on <br/>
learning--not on punishing anyone--profound learning can&#39;t happen when there&#39;s <br/>
punishment.<br/>
<br/>
And as for the &quot;letting them do whatever they want&quot; piece, that&#39;s the biggest <br/>
misconception in unschooling.  Unschooling is about deeply partnering with your child.  If <br/>
an activity they are engaged in is infringing on someone else&#39;s rights or property, it&#39;s your <br/>
job as partner to help them get out of that situation, and into one that does work--with <br/>
kindness, understanding, support and true desire to help them get what they really want.  <br/>
That can help cause expansion and understanding--whereas punishment causes <br/>
contraction.<br/>

<br/>
Okay, here is an example from this morning.  N (6) and Z (4) were fighting<br/>
this morning.  It ended up in a screaming match and N punched Z.  When she<br/>
tried to rebuttle (verbally), he plugged his ears and sang, &quot;La, la, la...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Normally I&#39;d separate them into different rooms (we don&#39;t really call it a<br/>
&quot;Time Out&quot; around here).  Then I&#39;d talk with each of them to figure out how<br/>
to handle it better next time.  According to the &quot;parenting with&quot; theory,<br/>
separating them is considered &quot;punishment.&quot;  So today, I came into the room,<br/>
asking, &quot;What happened?&quot;  N stormed off into his room (which I allowed him<br/>
to), in order to cool off.  This wasn&#39;t mandated by me, he just did it on<br/>
his own.  Z and I talked about what happened.  N got mad that we were<br/>
talking without him and came back into the room and attempted to talk with<br/>
us.  But really, he ended up yelling at both of us and when I asked him<br/>
things like, &quot;How do you think Z felt when you plugged your ears and ignored<br/>
her?&quot;  he just rolled his eyes, gave a half smirk, and said (very<br/>
sarcastically) &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;  Since he wasn&#39;t willing to talk, I told him<br/>
we&#39;d talk later when everyone had calmed down.  He got even madder at that,<br/>
and stormed off.<br/>
<br/>
So I didn&#39;t punish.  But I don&#39;t really feel good about how that situation<br/>
ended either.  Do I just let it go?  Are situations like this over when<br/>
everyone is calmed down and back into their thing?  In the meantime, do we<br/>
talk about respect/ignoring each other/etc. at a later time, without<br/>
pointing out any one specific instance.  But how do you do that?  What would<br/>
you say without sounding like you&#39;re &quot;giving a lesson?&quot;  Even in my personal<br/>
life, I&#39;m not good at starting conversations like this.  How on earth am I<br/>
going to do it with my children????<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think that&#39;s great. They&#39;re already feeling awful - THEY don&#39;t want  <br/>
disharmony and the bad feelings that come with conflict are already  <br/>
there - you don&#39;t have to impose punishment to make them feel worse,  <br/>
as if making them feel worse will provide motivation to do better next  <br/>
time. It won&#39;t. They&#39;ll do the best they can.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But I don&#39;t really feel good about how that situation<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They&#39;re very young - maybe focus a little on using as few words as  <br/>
possible to get a specific point across. For example, with young kids,  <br/>
it can help them to be very comfortable with a vocabulary to describe  <br/>
their feelings. So, rather than see the conflict as something you need  <br/>
to totally work through, just see it as a chance to use some  <br/>
descriptive words, with the idea being that over time they&#39;ll use the  <br/>
words instead of getting physical with each other.<br/>
<br/>
So - you purposely use words like mad, angry, frustrated, tired of it,  <br/>
shocked, scared, jealous, left out, lonely, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do I just let it go? Are situations like this over when<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe just a little, but not much. They ARE learning - through  <br/>
experience. Let them have the chance for the experience without  <br/>
talking too much about it - assume they&#39;ll learn from the experience.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But how do you do that?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe notice things you see on tv or in movies about kids. Help them  <br/>
develop empathy - say, &quot;I wonder how I would feel if that happened to  <br/>
me. How about you?&quot;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mostly just distract and make things better - they&#39;ll learn over time.  <br/>
You dont&#39; have to have big conversations, just help them as soon as  <br/>
possible. If there is a LOT of conflict, then be more present and  <br/>
intervene (happily with distraction or new fun ideas) sooner.<br/>

usually feeling a loss of power.  She is aware that her brother is stronger and intellectually <br/>
quicker, so she will do annoying things like that to try to even the score.  When she <br/>
discovered how much he detested being licked--well, that was fun!  He naturally uses <br/>
his age-based &quot;superiority.&quot;  He does it without thinking, and then seems genuinely <br/>
confused when she does something like that.  I&#39;m just wondering if that could be going on <br/>
between your kids.<br/>

take skillful juggling, and I don&#39;t think you&#39;re alone in feeling frustrated about that.  If only <br/>
we could temporarily clone!  I do find it to be more effective to talk with them separately <br/>
at first.  I find they need to &quot;tell their story,&quot; which is often completely &quot;unfair&quot; and without <br/>
any acceptance of personal responsibility at first.  So naturally the other will argue to <br/>
correct it, etc., but that isn&#39;t helpful for helping one at a time process their anger enough <br/>
to start hearing the other side.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

power. <br/>
<br/>
 Since he wasn&#39;t willing to talk, I told him<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; we&#39;d talk later when everyone had calmed down.  He got even madder at that,<br/>
&gt; and stormed off.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That seems o.k. to me--he may still have needed cool-down time, but it also seems like <br/>
he may have wanted to re-establish connection and couldn&#39;t do it in the context of the <br/>
confict.  Perhaps an invitation to get you when he was ready to talk, or to check in with <br/>
him and see if he just wanted a cuddle, etc.  Sometimes just holding my daughter, when <br/>
she&#39;s ready, helps her to shift herself back into a more connected place.  Your son had lost <br/>
connection with himself, and with the rest of the family.  The more you can keep the door <br/>
open to him to come back into connection, the quicker he will make the transition.  <br/>
Punishing, at this point, just drives a bigger wedge into the place of connection, gets the <br/>
ego involved, and makes everything harder than it needs to be.<br/>
<br/>
He needs to know that hitting is not o.k., but it needs to come in the context of love and <br/>
connection with you--not judgement and isolation--then he&#39;ll only learn the lesson of <br/>
judgement and isolation.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When he&#39;s calmed down and in a more receptive mood you can talk with him about that--<br/>
preferably with some physical contact.  That may come 2 minutes after the conflict, or it <br/>
may be an hour--whenever it is right.  Even if it&#39;s days later, he&#39;ll remember what <br/>
happened.  In the meanwhile, you can be connecting with your daughter and getting more <br/>
understanding about what happened, so that you can help her with her part.  I find sibling <br/>
stuff to rarely be about 1 victim and 1 perpetrator.  There&#39;s usually a dynamic that <br/>
escalates--so can you catch it before it gets to the hitting stage in the future?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;In the meantime, do we talk about respect/ignoring each other/etc. at a later time, <br/>
&gt;without pointing out any one specific instance.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am very specific, so that thoughts can be tied directly to actions.  And the less judgemental you can be the more potential there is for you to be present with your child.  <br/>
If you can get out of the mindset that you have to &quot;teach a lesson&quot; you&#39;ll be better off.  <br/>
Think more in terms of helping your child process what happened so that they can gain <br/>
understanding and insight into why hit.  You can then brainstorm some other solutions <br/>
with your child so that that awareness might carry forward into the next situation.  Your <br/>
child may even teach you a lesson--a lesson in sibling dynamics.  I didn&#39;t understand the <br/>
power dynamics of what was going on (duh!) until my dd said it.  I don&#39;t even remember <br/>
how it came up, but it was through me really trying to understand why it kept happening <br/>
and asking her lots of short questions.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;But how do you do that?  What would you say without sounding like you&#39;re &quot;giving a <br/>

<br/>

what happened between you and your sister yesterday?&quot;  &quot;Were you angry?&quot;  &quot;Were you <br/>
feeling like she wasn&#39;t listening to you?&quot;  &quot;Do you feel sometimes like she has more power <br/>
than you?&quot;  &quot;Do you hit her to get her to listen?&quot;  See what he has to say, and I&#39;ll bet you&#39;ll <br/>
get enough info to know where to go from there.<br/>

Yes!  I&#39;ve been trying this lately, and it seems to be helping (except for<br/>

when I can see the frustration level rising.  N has this thing about pushing<br/>
Z to her limits.  She could be screaming for him to &quot;STOP!&quot; overpowering<br/>
her, and he acts like he hardly notices.  So with him, I&#39;ve been trying to<br/>
point out that the tone of her voice has changed and she sounds like she<br/>
doesn&#39;t like the game they&#39;re playing anymore.  And with her, I&#39;ve been<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi Kim,<br/>
<br/>
I am behind on emails, so I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;m repeating anything others  <br/>
have said, but I felt compelled to answer your post.  I liked the  <br/>
Alfie Kohn Unconditional Parenting DVD, really a terrific &quot;gateway&quot;  <br/>
for those who are currently parenting on the authoritarian end of the  <br/>
spectrum (or for those who swing between permissive and  <br/>
authoritarian), but I feel Alfie is lacking in the practical &quot;what do  <br/>
you do when..&quot; stuff.<br/>
<br/>
People are often amazed when they learn that I have NEVER punished  <br/>
any of my four children (including my 16 year old son, who was often  <br/>
described as &quot;challenging&quot; and &quot;spirited&quot; when he was younger).  I  <br/>
have relied on connection instead.  It&#39;s interesting that you ask do  <br/>
we never &quot;have to&quot; punish/reward/praise - because people tend to  <br/>
assume that parents &quot;have to&quot; make children do certain things.  I am  <br/>
not &quot;permissive&quot;, in that I am authentic and direct with my kids and  <br/>
I have personal limits - which are few (and negotiable), and I  <br/>
certainly don&#39;t expect my kids to remember my limits and follow them,  <br/>
because I know that humans often have unmet needs or just impulses  <br/>
that over-rule &quot;doing the right thing&quot; even when it is what they want  <br/>
to do (and I always assume positive intent) and I &quot;set&quot; my limits in  <br/>
a respectful way that honors all of our feelings and deepens our  <br/>
connection.  To me, &quot;misbehavior&quot; is all about unmet needs, so if a  <br/>
child gets punished for having a need (that they are expressing in a  <br/>
&quot;mistaken&quot; way), the message of love and understanding doesn�t get  <br/>
through, and the underlying needs are never addressed.  Manipulation  <br/>
with threats of punishment (or promises of a reward) breaks the  <br/>
parent-child connection, and continues the cycle of pain - unmet  <br/>
needs � misbehavior � threats, etc.  Identifying and acknowledging  <br/>
feelings and offering understanding really goes a long way when  <br/>
things are hard - children have desires that sometimes just cannot be  <br/>
met (there are so many natural limits that occur in the world, i.e.  <br/>
it&#39;s raining out and they were hoping for sun) but a parent can be  <br/>
understanding and loving even when the child doesn&#39;t get exactly what  <br/>
they want.  Other things that help are having outlets for expressing  <br/>
anger, play-listening and playful parenting, quiet/silent empathy,  <br/>
unconditional forgiveness, reconnection through special time - and  <br/>
preventing the need for limits - assess for hunger, sleep  <br/>
deprivation, need for connection, attention, down time/alone time, etc.<br/>
<br/>
So, the answer is YES, it can be done, and it&#39;s a beautiful thing.<br/>

out how<br/>
to handle it better next time. According to the &quot;parenting with&quot; theory,<br/>
separating them is considered &quot;punishment.&quot;-=-<br/>

If there&#39;s a filter between you and your children, you&#39;re treating  <br/>
them like someone else&#39;s children, or theoretical children, aren&#39;t you?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve only glanced through Alfie Kohn stuff.  He never nursed a baby.   <br/>
He&#39;s not an unschooler.  He&#39;s writing for mass markets, statistical  <br/>
&quot;out there&quot; people he doesn&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
Joyce gave you some links I would&#39;ve given.  This is on a different  <br/>
one and I think it&#39;s important:<br/>
<br/>
********<br/>
<br/>
I have said to all my kids, but mostly Kirby on that case by case  <br/>
basis, that I&#39;m sorry if I have ever hurt them with words and made a  <br/>
bad memory they will have always, and I&#39;m sorry for some things I  <br/>
said to my sister when we were little, that I could never ever take  <br/>
back. I would say that thinking something mean without saying it is  <br/>
better than saying it, if he could help it.<br/>
<br/>
One of my main principles has been that it&#39;s my job to protect the  <br/>
peace of each of my children in his or her own home insofar as I can,  <br/>
and I&#39;m not just here to protect them from outsiders, axe-murderers  <br/>
and boogie-men of whatever real or imagined sort, but from each other  <br/>
as well.<br/>
<br/>
It makes me crazy when I hear a mom say &quot;They need to learn to work  <br/>
these things out for themselves.&quot; It&#39;s such cop-out, and such  <br/>
disregard for both the underdog kid AND the bullying kid, who is  <br/>
learning clearly that he can get away with what he can get away with,  <br/>
and his mother isn&#39;t going to interfere because she doesn&#39;t know or  <br/>
care how to make peace.<br/>
<br/>
But then what about families where the mom really doesn&#39;t know how to  <br/>
make peace? Maybe then it&#39;s good to have rules and time-outs so the  <br/>
peace kind of keeps itself a little more. But I think if she can gain  <br/>
more peacemaking tools, it&#39;s better for everyone.<br/>

catching the hand in the air before it strikes, getting between them,  <br/>
etc.), or help with problem solving - but if I don&#39;t get there in  <br/>
time, I first apologize to the child who was the hitter - I might say  <br/>
&quot;I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t get here in time&quot; because I know he didn&#39;t WANT  <br/>
to hit - if a child is hitting, there was a BIG unmet need/ <br/>
frustration going on and he needed my help to control his impulses,  <br/>
and I wasn&#39;t there to give it.  In our house the kids yell out  <br/>
&quot;problem!&quot; if they need help with a conflict, and I drop everything  <br/>
and go help out.  Sometimes they are so upset that they forget to  <br/>
yell &quot;problem!&quot; but it&#39;s been good for us to have a code word, and  <br/>
for them to trust that we will come right away and help when they  <br/>
need it.  A 6 year old&#39;s brain isn&#39;t really controlling his impulses  <br/>
(they have impulse control about 20% of the time at age 8) so I think  <br/>
that saying &quot;how do you think that made X feel when you did that&quot;  <br/>
feels shaming to the child, who has feelings of his own (that  <br/>
compelled him to hit) that are not being addressed.  When I am able  <br/>
to give empathy to the one who &quot;lost it&quot; first, they are more able to  <br/>
listen to others&#39; feelings after.  So I might say &quot;wow, looks like  <br/>
you were SO frustrated with X that you hit her&quot; in as non-judgmental  <br/>
tone as possible, and then he says &quot;yeah, she took my...&quot; or &quot;she  <br/>
kicked me&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m SO MAD!&quot; and so I hear all of his feelings and  <br/>
THEN say &quot;please call me next time&quot; or &quot;it&#39;s not OK with me for you  <br/>
to hit your sister - how can I help you next time?&quot;.  The &quot;victim&quot;  <br/>
gets your hugs and hears you telling her brother it&#39;s not OK to hit  <br/>
her, and often that&#39;s all she needs, though she may want to tell you  <br/>

<br/>
The latter.  Anything done in a contrived way with a child is putting  <br/>
something between you and the child.<br/>
<br/>
Anything condescending make the child smaller than he might need to be.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mean don&#39;t use babytalk with an infant, but some parents  <br/>
don&#39;t know when to quit, and are still babytalking a four year old.<br/>
<br/>
When I can&#39;t decide how to act, I use the &quot;treat them like a guest&quot;  <br/>
measure.<br/>
<br/>
All other things being equal, speaking to the aggressor first might  <br/>
make some kind of sense, but all things are NOT equal when one person  <br/>
has been attacked.  You might find out the kid who was attacked  <br/>
physically had been attacking in other non-physical ways, and you  <br/>
might want to advise him not to do that, but to talk to both kids  <br/>
together instead of separately reminds me too much of kids being sent  <br/>
to the principal&#39;s office.  Yuck.  Like a little court, with a  <br/>
judge.  Or worse, like a forced apology.   That&#39;s a way to encourage  <br/>
living on the glossy surface and to teach dishonesty, in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
When two kids are involved they probably both need a chance to  <br/>
express themselves, to be comforted and to be coached about possible  <br/>
similar future incidents.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, I can see how it might seem condescending, but really my tone is  <br/>
warm and sympathetic and curious, and saying &quot;wow&quot; is kind of just  <br/>
how I talk.  I KNOW that my kids would immediately call me on it if I  <br/>
WERE being condescending or sounding scripted in any way.   I have  <br/>
come across parents being really mean to their kids at the park, and  <br/>
I just kind of reflect back to them &quot;wow, looks like you&#39;re having a  <br/>
hard day&quot; in a mellow non-judgmental way BEFORE I try to advocate for  <br/>
better treatment of the children, just so they know that I am on  <br/>
their side, I&#39;m there to help, not criticize.<br/>
<br/>
And I was replying to the OP who was asking about 6 and 4 year olds,  <br/>
who have such BIG feelings, and I tend to meet them where they are, I  <br/>
might actually yell &quot;you&#39;re SO MAD!!&quot; to acknowledge the power with  <br/>
which they feel mad, but once my kids get older, they seem to have  <br/>
the same reaction you did (i.e DUH!) - when my son was 11 he said to  <br/>
me &quot;yeah, thanks mom, but I don&#39;t need you to tell me how I feel  <br/>
right now&quot;, and he was right, but of course by then he had his own  <br/>
language of feelings and needs and fully trusted that I understood  <br/>
him and wasn&#39;t judging his behavior, just trying to help.<br/>

longer pertain...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;For those of you (most of you, I assume) who do not<br/>
&gt;&gt;punish/reward/praise, how do you draw the line between practicing this<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think there is an underlying assumption here that letting children do<br/>
whatever they want would mean that they would want to do things we wouldn&#39;t<br/>
want them to. Also, that being a permissive parent is something we wouldn&#39;t<br/>
want to be.<br/>
<br/>
I think I would be categorized as a permissive parent. Which is good :o)<br/>
<br/>
If we are talking about young children who may choose things that don&#39;t fit<br/>
in the situation they are in, like screaming in a restaurant, or running<br/>
through people in a store, the idea is not to say &quot;No&quot;, but instead to<br/>
re-direct...take them outside where they can scream or run...not with<br/>
reprimand or a feeling of being punished, but going out with them with<br/>
pleasantness and joy. It&#39;s a matter of being &quot;with&quot; them in what they are<br/>
doing, and, being the more experienced person, finding a way to let them do<br/>
it in the moment.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Do you really NEVER have to punish/reward/praise?&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My kids are ages 14, 15, 18 and 19. They have never been grounded, spanked,<br/>
made to go to their rooms, timed out, etc. When things have come up in the<br/>
past...arguments, disrespectful behavior, etc...we discussed, just I like I<br/>
would do with my husband, though the language may be different. If there was<br/>
heat in the moment, I worked to stay calm and loving, seeking to understand<br/>
all sides of whatever the situation was. Sometimes kids would have to<br/>
separate so no one would be hurt. It wasn&#39;t long before kids understood that<br/>
they would be heard, and they usually allowed my attention to go to another<br/>
child. Sometimes saying that everyone will get a turn to talk helped if<br/>
things started to escalate. In fact, when kids learn that their parent(s)<br/>
will seek to understand them, and will genuinely listen to them, situations<br/>
diffuse more quickly, until they come to a place of more easily working<br/>
things out themselves.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of my kids sometimes swear a lot in their conversations with each<br/>
other or with friends at home. Usually it doesn&#39;t bother me at all. But<br/>
sometimes it does. I&#39;ll say something like, &quot;I&#39;m feeling a little sensitive<br/>
about the swearing right now&quot; and they gladly stop. Nothing unharmonious and<br/>
no hard feelings on any side. Last night my son Max asked me to turn down<br/>
the volume on the TV. And I did, happily. We listen to and respect each<br/>
other.<br/>
<br/>
Of praise: my son and his band recently won a huge jazz competition in<br/>
California. He didn&#39;t get to the level of musicianship that he has through<br/>
any praise by us. He didn&#39;t look to see what made other people happy in this<br/>
endeavor. This is a passion. It has been self-driven, and fortunately, we<br/>
knew enough to stay out of the way and support the passion, (mostly in<br/>
supplying equipment and rides to lessons and just appreciating his work). I<br/>
sometimes wonder if he would have gone as far as he has if we were<br/>
rah-rah-reeing on the sidelines.<br/>
<br/>
This idea applies to playdough-making, getting dressed and<br/>
teeth-brushing...how would you feel if someone you lived with interrupted<br/>
every little thing you did with &quot;Good job!&quot;. It&#39;s pretty condescending<br/>
actually.<br/>

we are their foundations.<br/>

This is too permissive for my tastes.  Saying yes as much as you can  <br/>
does not (in my view) extend to saying &quot;Yes, scream in public,&quot; but  <br/>
to pointing out that there are some things that are not done in some  <br/>
places.  Take them out, yes, but don&#39;t say &quot;Yes, screaming is great,  <br/>
let&#39;s do it in the parking lot.&quot;  But &quot;No, screaming where people are  <br/>
sitting quietly isn&#39;t cool; can you stop?&quot;   (Not in those words, in  <br/>
real words appropriate to the situation and the people.)  If stopping  <br/>
isn&#39;t an option, then take them somewhere else and get it stopped  <br/>
sweetly and gently, but even parking lots aren&#39;t great places for  <br/>
screaming kids.<br/>

This has been wholly true at our house, and has broadened to the  <br/>

will seek to understand them, and will genuinely listen to them, situations<br/>
diffuse more quickly, until they come to a place of more easily working<br/>
things out themselves.***<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been noticing this with my son!  Since I&#39;ve been trying the &quot;no<br/>
punishment&quot; etc. approach, each situation--where I would normally say, &quot;Go<br/>
to your room!&quot;--has been dealt with in a more loving and thoughtful way.<br/>
I&#39;m trying really hard to see things from his perspective.  Today, N flipped<br/>
out because we turned the bathroom faucet off on him. (He was outside and<br/>
left it running.)  He stormed off outside, screaming that he wanted to<br/>
either die (from the mountain lions that live near our house) or kill me!<br/>
Normally I&#39;d freak out because he had gotten so violent.  But today, I<br/>
approached him in a very loving way.  I ignored the comments and made him<br/>
understand that I loved him, no matter what, and then began to help him see<br/>
that we weren&#39;t trying to be mean to him.  In the middle of our<br/>
conversation, just as I was wondering if I was approaching this the right<br/>
way or not, he suddenly said, &quot;Oh Mommy, I forgot to tell you!  I just saw a<br/>
whole herd of deer galloping away a few minutes ago!  They went that way.&quot;<br/>
Then he continued his happy banter and completely forgot that he was mad at<br/>
me!  Just like that!  I was floored!  It was like a switch went off in him.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So I am starting to see how my changes are affecting him.<br/>
<br/>
BUT...<br/>
<br/>
Here is a situation that I&#39;m not sure how to approach:  N (6) is constantly<br/>
hitting DH and I!  He does it when he is angry or frustrated.  He runs up,<br/>
hits us, and then runs away.  We (DH especially) find it really hard to just<br/>
do nothing about this.  And by &quot;do nothing,&quot; of course, I mean punish.  Even<br/>
though we talk to him about other ways to vent his frustration, we feel like<br/>
we&#39;re &quot;doing nothing.&quot;  Logically, I get the fact that it would really do<br/>
him no good to be punished.  I understand that no matter what the punishment<br/>
would be, he wouldn&#39;t learn the lesson we are trying to teach (&quot;No<br/>
hitting&quot;).  I guess what I am having trouble with is the trust issue.  I<br/>
find it really hard to believe that if we don&#39;t do SOMETHING to show him<br/>
that it is not okay to disrespect his parents (or anyone, for that matter),<br/>
then he won&#39;t ever learn that.  (You know those disrespectful adults that we<br/>
desperately don&#39;t want our children to turn out to be?)  I suppose it&#39;s<br/>
about fear.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing:  I feel like I&#39;ve been trying so hard to be loving and<br/>
respectful in my new approach to parenting, that I am putting my own<br/>
feelings on hold.  Now to a degree, that&#39;s what I&#39;m supposed to do as the<br/>
mature adult.  But I don&#39;t think hiding my emotions is really healthy for<br/>
either of us.  Is it possible to be respectful and loving towards your<br/>
children and also show them that you are angry and annoyed?<br/>
<br/>
(Sorry for the rant!  You just got me thinking again!)<br/>
<br/>
***We&#39;re not their sculptors,<br/>
we are their foundations.***<br/>
<br/>
My mother use to say that it was her job to &quot;mold&quot; us while we were little.<br/>
She lovingly called it &quot;brainwashing!&quot;  And I wonder why I can&#39;t think for<br/>
myself half the time!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>*Why* is he frustrated and angry?<br/>
<br/>
Rather than focusing on his reaction to frustration and anger, focus  <br/>
on finding ways for him to not be angry and frustrated!<br/>
<br/>
That won&#39;t eliminate it all, but it&#39;s a big step. What he wants when  <br/>
he&#39;s frustrated and angry is to solve whatever problem is causing it!  <br/>
When he has other tools to solve his problems with you can say &quot;No  <br/>
hitting&quot; and then  focus on more helpful solutions. If he doesn&#39;t  <br/>
have other tools, then it&#39;s not his fault!<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re in the middle of a frustrating problem and you do something  <br/>
(throw something, swear, whatever) and someone tells you not to throw  <br/>
things, how do you feel? Doesn&#39;t that sound like &quot;I don&#39;t care what  <br/>
your problem is, don&#39;t do something I don&#39;t like.&quot; Wouldn&#39;t you feel  <br/>
*more* frustrated and angry?<br/>

<br/>
But in most cases it&#39;s even better to find ways not to be angry and  <br/>
annoyed. To turn your thinking around so that you&#39;re seeing things  <br/>
from a different perspective. Easily said, of course! And there are  <br/>
various techniques people have mentioned.<br/>
<br/>
Have you read Scott Noelle&#39;s Daily Groove? They&#39;re short and to the  <br/>
point. He often has techniques for seeing things differently. Here&#39;s  <br/>
a recent one. Click on the link and you can subscribe to his daily  <br/>

<br/>
THE DAILY GROOVE ~ by Scott Noelle<br/>
www.enjoyparenting.com/dailygroove<br/>
<br/>
:: From REactive to PROactive ::<br/>
<br/>
Reactive parenting is like an airplane on auto-pilot<br/>
flying off-course: to set a new course you must first<br/>
get control of the plane on its *present* course.<br/>
<br/>
That means, paradoxically, that you can avoid an<br/>
unwanted reaction by deciding to do it *deliberately*!<br/>
<br/>
Example: You&#39;re about to yell at your child, and<br/>
you can&#39;t stop yourself. So you decide to yell<br/>
*on purpose*, with the full force of your deliberate<br/>
intention!  BUT...<br/>
<br/>
You alter the outburst in some way that makes it<br/>
benign, like singing a really high/loud note instead<br/>
of yelling, or changing your words to &quot;Blabbety!<br/>
Blabbety! BLAH!&quot; Anything that works *with* your<br/>
emotional energy rather than against it.<br/>
<br/>
Once you&#39;ve shifted from REactive to PROactive, you<br/>
can direct your energy *consciously*, in accord with<br/>
your ideals.<br/>
<br/>
This technique is not a panacea, but it works<br/>
especially well with *mild* reactiveness -- often<br/>
turning potential conflict into playful fun!<br/>

  Jackie - I loved everything you had to say!  I wish I could also say that my kids were in there teens and that I had never grounded them, spanked them, sent them to their rooms. :(  My teens are pretty controlling with eachother and their younger siblings.  I cringe because I think &quot;sheesh, I did that...I modeled that behavior and trained them to be that way&quot; Ugh.  But, I can go forward today choose something better from here on out.  Anyway, I loved what you said about not being their sculptors, but their foundations.  That goes SO against the idea that we have to &quot;mold their little minds and hearts&quot;...but it sounds so right!  It rings in my spirit.  <br/>

Something&#39;s missing.  If he went outside and left the faucet running  <br/>

You&#39;ve defined that as violent.  He didn&#39;t even attempt to kill you,  <br/>
or you&#39;d probably have mentioned it.  He left, screaming.<br/>
<br/>
If you define that as expression instead of violence, you&#39;ll be a  <br/>
giant step closer to clarity.<br/>

<br/>
This will seem picky, and it is, but the words you&#39;re using aren&#39;t  <br/>
reflecting clear thought.<br/>
<br/>
If you can look at what you yourself write down, do a pass at  <br/>
deciding if it&#39;s clearly true or to the point, you can figure more of  <br/>
these things out on your own.  Not that people on this list will mind  <br/>
helping, but rather than having us show you what you&#39;re thinking, you  <br/>
can begin to work on mindfully observing your own thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
So he&#39;s not &quot;constantly&quot; hitting you.  Constant would be....  <br/>
constant.  Not doing anything else in his life.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You said he does it when he&#39;s angry or frustrated.  Something made  <br/>
him angry or frustrated.  Can you work back a few steps and see what  <br/>
you or your husband did to cause so much fear and unhappiness in your  <br/>
son?<br/>
<br/>
The question I&#39;m going to ask about this is real and important,  <br/>
though you can answer it internally and not here if you&#39;d rather:<br/>
<br/>
-=-We (DH especially) find it really hard to just do nothing about  <br/>
this. And by &quot;do nothing,&quot; of course, I mean punish. Even though we  <br/>

we&#39;re &quot;doing nothing.&quot; -=-<br/>
<br/>
What were you doing when you were &quot;doing something&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
How was that working out for you?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Instead of talking to him about other ways to vent his frustration,  <br/>
how about removing the frustrations as much as you can?  when he  <br/>
starts to trust you, he&#39;ll relax and soften up.  He&#39;s feeling trapped  <br/>
and defensive, as any frightened mammal will do.  I bet you could  <br/>
figure out how to get a dog to bite, or a cat to scratch, or a rat or  <br/>
mouse to freak out.  Somehow you&#39;ve caused your child to freak out  <br/>
and hit.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I find it really hard to believe that if we don&#39;t do SOMETHING to  <br/>
show him that it is not okay to disrespect his parents (or anyone,  <br/>
for that matter), then he won&#39;t ever learn that. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I think you want him to feign respect, rather than actually becoming  <br/>
people he can&#39;t help but respect.<br/>
<br/>
Real respect has to do with trust and admiration.<br/>
<br/>
-=-(You know those disrespectful adults that we desperately don&#39;t  <br/>
want our children to turn out to be?) -=-<br/>
<br/>
Of course.  They were all shamed and ignored and punished and  <br/>
bullied, weren&#39;t they?  In my experience, those who grew up with a  <br/>
chip on their shoulder are bundles of resentment.  They&#39;re usually  <br/>
resenting real actions and limits and indifference that can be  <br/>
recited, if they&#39;re still in the mood to talk about it.  Some got out  <br/>
of the mood to talk or think about it years ago.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Another thing: I feel like I&#39;ve been trying so hard to be loving and<br/>

<br/>
It is possible to say &quot;That frustrates me, but let&#39;s figure out what  <br/>
to do.&quot;  One very healing thing would be to apologize to him from  <br/>
time to time.  Maybe like &quot;I know we would have hit you for this or  <br/>
sent you to your room, when you were little, but I wish I hadn&#39;t.   <br/>
Help me figure out a better thing to do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Things will  get better and better as you make choices that lead  <br/>
toward the place you want to be.  Your son is older every day, every  <br/>
moment.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>The way to have respectful kids is to treat them respectfully.  Period.<br/>
<br/>
We had some horrible scenes growing up with my father &quot;demanding respect.&quot;  We NEVER <br/>
knew what that meant, but when he would say it I would have this disgusted kind of <br/>
feeling toward him.  I couldn&#39;t give him what he wanted, and he knew it.  He saw his own <br/>
disrespect of us reflected back to him in our eyes, and he hated it.<br/>
<br/>
I see my respectfulness reflected back to me through my kids eyes and it fills my heart.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes we&#39;ll talk about specific behavior that can feel more respectful or disrespectful, <br/>
but we speak in terms of appearances.  I would never tell my children they owe anyone <br/>
respect.  People have to earn it--it&#39;s not given, it&#39;s grown and nurtured.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You know those disrespectful adults that we desperately don&#39;t want our children to turn <br/>
out to be?)  I suppose it&#39;s about fear.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I started to think, oh yeah--and then I realized that no, I don&#39;t actually know what you <br/>
mean.  I suspect that this is about fear, and about a stereotype in your mind.  And do you <br/>
really think it fair to apply it to a six-year-old?  It might be one you want to examine a <br/>
little more closely and throw out!<br/>
<br/>
When we let close family and friends know that we were going to work on starting a family <br/>
(we&#39;d been married 5 years already, and had lots of people wanting to know!), they were <br/>
all very happy and supportive.  When I told my father, who lives in a pretty critical world <br/>
full of worry and fear, he presented me with his fear for me--it looked like this:<br/>
<br/>
That I would become like those women he sees in Wal-Mart, who are really fat and have a <br/>
bunch of kids running around them out of control.  And did I mention she&#39;s really fat?<br/>
<br/>
Where did this come from?  Beats me.  But he had this image in his head for me.  Wasn&#39;t <br/>
that lovely?  lol  Anyway, that image didn&#39;t really affect me much because it wasn&#39;t based <br/>
on anything remotely having to do with me or my life, and in fact by that time I had two <br/>
college degrees--and I&#39;m sure the woman in his vision didn&#39;t have one.  But it sure let me <br/>
know that this wasn&#39;t a person that I could trust to see me in any meaningful way.  Work <br/>
to see your son clearly--not through the skewed vision of a stereotype. <br/>

whatever reason wether they did something or wether it&#39;s just me being a<br/>
ninny head, I find the very very best thing for me to do is refocus my<br/>
thoughts.  It goes something like this... AAAhhh I really hate that she<br/>
is behaving that way, ok, but she usually doesn&#39;t behave that way, ok,<br/>
usually she&#39;s really kind and considerate of ..., ok, I like it that she<br/>
is like that, that is her true nature, she&#39;s kind and considerate, she<br/>
must be really in a lot of pain right now to be feeling so yucky as to<br/>
lash out and behave in that way, ok, I should go and talk to her with<br/>
that beautiful image of her true person in my head and let her know how<br/>
much I love her and that if she needs help with anything that I&#39;m there<br/>
for her, just say the word.<br/>
<br/>
The shift of seeing my kids as beautiful people with beautiful qualities<br/>
helps me focus on that part of their nature and accept that what they<br/>
are showing me when they aren&#39;t that way isn&#39;t really their true nature,<br/>
but a temporary reaction to circumstances.  The simple thought of seeing<br/>
my kids as beautiful rather than tyrannical, allows me to help them with<br/>
compassion.</div>

 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re not using the word &quot;respect&quot; correctly. You mean &quot;act&quot;  <br/>
respectfully, which is not the same as actually having respect.<br/>
<br/>
Earn his respect for your thoughtfulness and kindness and helpfulness,  <br/>
for the way you behave, yourselves.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mean let him hit you - would YOU respect someone who let him/ <br/>
herself be hit over and over?<br/>
<br/>
When he runs at you, to hit you, wrap your arms around him. Hold him  <br/>
just firmly enough so he can&#39;t hit you. Squat down to his level and  <br/>
look right into his eyes and say, &quot;What do you need?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Do that IMMEDIATELY when you see him coming. Even if he gets a little  <br/>
bit of a hit in, do it. Hold his arms so he can&#39;t hit you again. Say,  <br/>
&quot;No hitting. What do you need?&quot; It can also help to give him some  <br/>
words for expressing emotions. Hitting is usually frustration, often  <br/>
because of not being able to articulate needs.<br/>

  Maybe he just needs practice doing it differently.  For instance, if he comes up and hits you, you could remind him to &quot;use your words&quot; or ask him, &quot;it seems like you&#39;d like to tell me or daddy something?  What would you like to say?&quot;  Or maybe you can say, &quot;if you need to hit, go hit your pillow a little then come back and tell us what you want to say&quot;.  Do you think any of those would work?  I think after awhile ... after practicing... he&#39;ll be better at using words instead of hitting.  It&#39;s a thought.<br/>
