<div id="ygrps-yiv-2124811321">I started the L.I.F.E. support group (Learning in Freedom Everyday) <br/>
specifically for supporting unschoolers, but also for anyone looking for a <br/>
nonreligious group.<br/>
LeaAnn and I figured we&#39;d not have a whole lot of interest, but it would be <br/>
nice for those pagan, atheist and other homeschoolers that are feeling <br/>
isolated due to all the very fundi homeschoolers down here.<br/>
Well, this month, the main support group just HAD to adopt a statement of <br/>
faith for it&#39;s leaders, which includes any parents wanting to organize a <br/>
field trip or host a geography day (something they have regularly).<br/>
So to make a long story short, we are now getting phone calls from ULTRA <br/>
conservative people that have a problem with a sof, and want a group that is <br/>
not going to adopt one.<br/>
Our group (for some reason I can&#39;t quite figure out) seems to be their best <br/>
alternative.<br/>
Yikes.<br/>
This isn&#39;t what we planned at ALL!!<br/>
I&#39;m being very blunt with them as to what it&#39;s all about, mentioned our <br/>
Halloween party a couple of times to be sure. So here I am in the unique <br/>
position of being the only group they know of that is nonreligious.<br/>
I spent over an hour on the phone last night trying to explain unschooling <br/>
and why I believe in attachment parenting/non spanking etc....<br/>
I sent one lady some links to read, not sure if I&#39;m wanting to be the voice <br/>
for Christian homeschoolers that need to start thinking for the first time in <br/>
their lives.<br/>
I pointed some things out that got an &quot;I never thought about that&quot; response, <br/>
especially in regards to spanking.<br/>
The plan was to reach all the homeschoolers that felt alone or without <br/>
support due to their beliefs or lack thereof. But a stupid sof has caused a <br/>
fall out that even I did not expect.<br/>
I&#39;d like to write the President of the homeschool league and tell them just <br/>
what effect it&#39;s had. Is it even worth my time to explain why sof&#39;s are a BAD <br/>
thing?<br/>
sigh.....<br/>
Just needing to unload. Thanks for being here y&#39;all.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I started a similar group, called Live & Learn, where I used to live.  In <br/>
that location, you can&#39;t turn around without bumping into a church and church <br/>
members, so we had a lot of the same issues.  Some of the Christians who were <br/>
attracted to Live & Learn because of their associations with other people in <br/>
the group decided to start their own Christian type group, that would have no <br/>
statement of faith, and would be open to all sorts of Christians.  It&#39;s a <br/>
pretty good group, as tolerant as can be expected in the climate, and still <br/>
going strong.  <br/>
<br/>
I suggest you simply suggest to those who call that they build something for <br/>
themselves.  It doesn&#39;t have to be S.O.F. or unschooling.  <br/>

<br/>
Our group here in Chicago is an inclusive non-sectarian group. It wasn&#39;t set <br/>
up for unschoolers (we&#39;re definitely still a minority) or for any particular <br/>
agenda at all. As far as I can tell, we are the best group that has ever <br/>
existed! There are very religious people of all persuasions and pagans, <br/>
super-structured folks and me &lt;gg&gt;. The wide variety of people is teaching us <br/>
all about lots of things, including tolerance and respect. Right now I think <br/>
there are 80 or 90 families involved.<br/>
<br/>
As regards your group then, you could explain to the new people where the <br/>
group is coming from and then let the chips fall where they may. Or maybe <br/>
your group will morph into something a little different, but still great.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1759073217">Hi Ren, I would love to see the HS links you sent to that lady. I want to know more about attached parenting and non spanking without having to weed thru every link in the history of mankind. I would really appreciate it!

You could just tell them how to start their own group.  Or you could start it <br/>
for them and then drop out.<br/>
<br/>
Or you could have two divisions of your group--two lists.  And find some <br/>
leader-type for their division.   And then split.<br/>

<br/>
Oh absolutely NOT!   They had a reason, and they&#39;re probably glad to see each <br/>
family that won&#39;t sign go.  They don&#39;t want the unwashed, the unsaved, the <br/>
uncooperative.<br/>
