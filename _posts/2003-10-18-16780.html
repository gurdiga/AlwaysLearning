<div id="ygrps-yiv-869194190"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; My 5 yo gets $5/week -- enough so that she can buy a small toy if she wants<br/>
&gt; to, or save for a bigger toy<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My son get 5 euros a week, which is now something like $5.50.  We had the<br/>
same experience of him wanting to spend it all the first couple weeks, and<br/>
then learning to save towards something he wanted more.<br/>
<br/>
By having an allowance, Tim discovered that the value of money is in having<br/>
more of it.  He is far less likely to buy little stuff or icecream cones (on<br/>
days when I&#39;m not buying!), and much more likely to save and get something<br/>
he really wants.  It&#39;s helped him think about what he really desires and<br/>
values.  We do still buy him things, of course, or we help him buy more<br/>
expensive things.  But it seems like we all buy less this way.  Seeing him<br/>
be frugal about his funds can help me remember that money doesn&#39;t grow on<br/>
trees, too.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; The money isn&#39;t tied to her behavior in any way.  It is the line item in the<br/>
&gt; family budget for Lydia discretionary spending, similar to the line item that<br/>
&gt; my husband and I each have.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Exactly.  I tell Tim that he shares in our wealth because he&#39;s part of our<br/>
family.  In the same way, I ask if he would help with things around our home<br/>
because he is part of our family.  At 7, he does some things now without<br/>
being asked.  But when I ask, he&#39;s generally happy to help.  To me, it&#39;s<br/>
sort of the same attitude many parents use, that chores and money are<br/>
related, but in the happy, friendly way (you&#39;re part of the family) instead<br/>
of the mean threatening way.  I don&#39;t see the need to be mean about it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1537140533">Hi,<br/>
Brianna works in our home business. She receives $25.00 per day - when we are out at powwows. There&#39;s one powwow she really loves - at that one, she volunteers in the cook shack or at the tribal table; at this powwow - because she doesn&#39;t work for me - she doesn&#39;t get paid. She is happy with that - no work/no money reality.<br/>
There is no allowance - as she gets older, she learns more about Coyotes Corner. She wanted more money - powwow season is over. She&#39;s started Mudpuppy RX - she&#39;ll be selling pet products; cat/dog First Aid kits; reflective capes; healthy chew toys; etc.<br/>
<br/>
She also gets paid for certain jobs - and she has the right to suggest (and push through) jobs/projects. She wants to paint the living room. I really didn&#39;t care about the LR - esp. the one wall that bothered her.<br/>
We have the paint right here.<br/>
She also wants to paint my/our bedroom. We&#39;ll do that before Thanksgiving.<br/>
<br/>
