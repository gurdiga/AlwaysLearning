<div id="ygrps-yiv-516731398">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;ll really be on this time, :-) since the show was taped today <br/>
(Monday).  It is Newsmaker from Hornell NY, on WLEA 1480, with Kevin Doran.  It <br/>
plays at 8:40 am and 4:10 pm Eastern time tomorrow (Tues).<br/>
<br/>
It was a fun time - Kevin is very pro-homeschooling so that was helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Listen in if you get a chance!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Connie<br/>
