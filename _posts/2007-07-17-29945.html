<div id="ygrps-yiv-517923986">Thought this was interesting, especially in light of a recent thread:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I went to a scrapbooking crop this weekend where the other ladies had <br/>
teenagers. My oldest kid is six, so I was asking them what their kids <br/>
are like, etc.<br/>
<br/>
One of them told me her 17 year old daughter announced that she plans <br/>
to get a tattoo when she turns 18. The woman said, &quot;I told her fine, <br/>
but then she can expect to pay for her own health insurance and ...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I sort of played dumb and said, &quot;What does that have to do with <br/>
anything? Do they raise your insurance rates when you get a tattoo?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She said, &quot;Oh no, but if she&#39;s going to do something we don&#39;t believe <br/>
in, then she&#39;s going to have to be on her own and find her own place <br/>
and pay all her own bills.&quot; Smug smile. &quot;I guess we&#39;ll just see how <br/>
badly she wants that tatoo.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Real nice.<br/>
<br/>
She and the other lady there kept making what I thought was an <br/>
interesting comment refering to their teen kids: &quot;She thinks she&#39;s <br/>
older than she really is.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I forget how &quot;unusual&quot; I must be until I hear conversations <br/>
like this.<br/>

a particular activity scrapbookers engage in? The latter I could<br/>
understand and picture, but would be fascinated to learn that a groups<br/>
of scrapbookers are called crops.<br/>

Talk of crops and cropping made me think you all, scrapbookers that<br/>
is, must be cultivated folk. <br/>
