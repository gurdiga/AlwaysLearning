boring thread.&quot; (For those who didn&#39;t see it, the beginning of the thread<br/>
was a piece of an article quoting the French Minister of education giving<br/>
his reasons for why schools are boring.)<br/>

&gt;&gt; Tedium has always been part of school and boredom in the classroom is said to<br/>
&gt;&gt; be rampant everywhere in the video age.  France has made efforts in recent<br/>
&gt;&gt; years to involve pupils in more creative activities.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; There&#39;s more but I can&#39;t find the link.<br/>

&gt; Shyrley, this is interesting timing. I have friends in town who are<br/>
&gt; French. I&#39;ve lived in France and speak French. I went to college in<br/>
&gt; France for a year.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One of the French moms invited a number of homeschoolers<br/>
&gt; over to meet other French mothers. They didn&#39;t know anything<br/>
&gt; about homeschooling and asked us all kinds of questions. The<br/>
&gt; most startling response to all our sharing was when one mother<br/>
&gt; said,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Even if the education is inferior and even if the children don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; enjoy it, I would not want to pull my children out of the state<br/>
&gt; funded programs to make them better than other people. We<br/>
&gt; should all have the same education and not make some<br/>
&gt; superior to others.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well tie my shoelaces!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Right there I saw the cultural absorption of the ideals of<br/>
&gt; socialism. all the motehrs basically agreed with this position, yet<br/>
&gt; they couldn&#39;t let go of their fascination with our way of doing<br/>
&gt; things. It was enlightening.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One thing they also said was that their kids loved going to school<br/>
&gt; in the states! They loved the way the students could get up and<br/>
&gt; move around a classroom, the encouragement of group projects<br/>
&gt; and the absence of ridicule as a method of motivation (very<br/>
&gt; prevalent in France). They also preferred the way teachers used<br/>
&gt; multi media to the typical workbook program all day.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That was interesting. France made these poor kids keep up with<br/>
&gt; their French grade levels in addition to their schooling here so<br/>
&gt; these kids were literally doing two times the work of our kids in<br/>
&gt; school here. I felt so badly for them. :(<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; University in France was a kick! Classes began in Sept. but the<br/>
&gt; students didn&#39;t show up until mid Oct and sometimes not until<br/>
&gt; the New Year. Classes lasted all year. I actually enjoyed my<br/>
&gt; classes there very much, even though they weren&#39;t that rigorous.<br/>
&gt; I was used to UCLA which is a pretty academic school.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There is a painful apathy in French children and they are<br/>
&gt; notoriously mischevious. It&#39;s something that we&#39;ve noticed over<br/>
&gt; the years (we lived in Morocco too and knew French families<br/>
&gt; there...). But the mothers are actually quite wonderful in many<br/>
&gt; ways too. They don&#39;t believe in corporal punishment, are very<br/>
&gt; affectionate and they lead rich artisitc lives compared to what I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; used to here.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Strange mix.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; All that to say that I&#39;m not at all surprised that the government<br/>
&gt; would say school isn&#39;t meant to be fun. :)<br/>
