&gt; &gt;Hmmm. I don&#39;t like the way many classes for homeschooler are done,<br/>
&gt; &gt;especially when they&#39;re done in a &quot;school-ish&quot;,or a developmentally<br/>
&gt; &gt;inappropriate way.  I don&#39;t have a problem with classes in general,<br/>
&gt; &gt;though. <br/>

Resource Center, which offers group classes and trips for homeschoolers <br/>
across Massachusetts. When the new newsletters come out, Julian looks at them <br/>
and decides what, if any, he wants to do. Usually there are at least a few, <br/>
mostly through the Museum of Science or MIT, or nature-y things. Some end up <br/>
being schooly, but he takes what he wants from them and ignores the rest. <br/>
He&#39;s gotten to do some things that you can&#39;t, unfortunately, do as <br/>
individuals, or other things it ould never occur to us existed but have <br/>
ignited passions. He hasn&#39;t done any of the more structured, ongoing classes <br/>
in a while. I&#39;m glad.<br/>
