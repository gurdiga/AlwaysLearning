&lt;&lt; I have been on this list for quite a while and have only been reading <br/>
messages to gain knowledge about unschoolers.  We have been unschooling in <br/>
Michigan for  4 years.  We are the only unschoolers in our area and I have <br/>
been wondering what other unschoolers are like.  I have the feeling that we <br/>
do not exactly fit in with the homeschoolers in our area. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been collecting typical days (minutes, years) in one place, if you want <br/>
to read some concentrated about-unschooling stuff.  It&#39;s here:<br/>

<br/>
Our family is one of those featured in a book called &quot;A Patchwork of Days,&quot; <br/>
and while some people have found that book useful, it is NOT an unschooling <br/>
book.  It seems many of the families wake up at 6:00, milk to goats, feed the <br/>
chickens, study the Bible by kerosene lamp, make breakfast, and get dressed <br/>
(modestly) for school to start in the den at 8:00, and it&#39;s downhill backwards into <br/>
the 19th century from there (IN my prejudiced unschooling liberal estimation).<br/>
<br/>
Those reports can be found online too, but I really wanted to have a good <br/>
sampling of unschoolers&#39; peeks into how it works.<br/>

ever read, back when Tim was still a wee little one.  I was intimidated by<br/>
it, really.  I could never keep the schedule some of those folks do!<br/>
<br/>
Then I discovered unschooling someplace on-line, and felt much better!<br/>

I know, our chapter is buried in among the many, many (many) structured <br/>
homeschoolers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1393907613">Hi Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling seems to be a concept that takes a while before you really get <br/>
it.  Having done it for a while, it makes perfect sense to me, but others <br/>
just can&#39;t grasp it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the link.  I will check it out sometime.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;Patchwork&quot; book I checked out some time ago and after reading a few <br/>
examples, I gave up on reading the rest.  It does show how differently <br/>
families manage homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe someday we&#39;ll put together our own Patchwork of UNSCHOOLING Days!<br/>
<br/>

Hey Sandra.. I get up around 7am to milk the goats.. my girls sleep in to 10<br/>
or 11 or later.. I also feed the chickens and usually head out to the garden<br/>
after that..but no school or bible study required here!!<br/>
