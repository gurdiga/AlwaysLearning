<div id="ygrps-yiv-498828831">I&#39;m with Kelly.  I always want to know what is going on with my kids and <br/>
a good purveyor of information can be very useful.  Sometimes it can be <br/>
annoying -- because the tattler&#39;s motives may not be of purely helpful <br/>
intent.  Sometimes (or many times) they just wanna see someone get in <br/>
TROUBLE. However, most of the time the information purveyor is simply <br/>
providing commentary while trying to figure it all out for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
As a child care provider I&#39;ve had many different little personalities in <br/>
my care and supervision.  Any group of young children has a fascinating <br/>
and fun dynamic.  I had one child who was a real worrier -- and a <br/>
big-time information purveyor.  At the same time I had another child who <br/>
was a big risk-taker and boundary-tester.  I specifically asked my <br/>
little IP guy if he was willing to report  regularly on the doings of my <br/>
little thrill-seeker.  Natch, I never let T-S get too far afield, but I <br/>
figured and extra set of eyes and ears, along with frequent detailed <br/>
reports on his doings, couldn&#39;t hurt.  Eventually the thrill-seeker <br/>
calmed down and the spy-guy outgrew his constant need to report.         <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;But speaking of &quot;ratting...&quot;<br/>
&gt;Holly is finding it hard to fathom that some parents punish or criticize kids for tattling.  First she had to hear what &quot;tattle&quot; meant, and she said &quot;Even if it&#39;s telling them that a kid is in danger?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I told her some parents are just not clear themselves about what is good <br/>
&gt;information and what is trying to get other kids in trouble, and so some <br/>
&gt;parents, to make it easier on *them* have a blanket rule against &quot;tattling.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;She&#39;s appalled.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Good for her and her possible future kids.<br/>
