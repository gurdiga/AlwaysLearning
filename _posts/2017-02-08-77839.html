<br/>
It’s something that has been observed by lots of unschoolers.  It’s not a “should” or an always.  It’s a “not unusual.”<br/>
Kids are individuals and no one will follow every generality.<br/>
<br/>
I told the story so people wouldn’t be shocked and give up, because I’ve seen LOTS of kids who liked school and did well thrive in Jr. High / Midschool and then slump (or worse) in high school.  I saw it as a kid, as a teacher, and saw it in my unschooled children’s school-going friends.  It doesn’t happen to ALL kids in school, but it is not uncommon.<br/>

OH MY GOSH, thank you!  <br/>
<br/>
I looked for learning curve and it didn’t come up and I gave up too easily.<br/>
<br/>
Me, in that photo, looking happily surprised that you found it! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I find things easily and sometimes I let my google failure dismay me. :-)<br/>
<br/>
(actually that photo makes it look like I was scared of Pam Laricchia, or that she was the only person in the room. :-)  But most people were in the other sections, especially the one close to the room where the kids were playing.  It wasn’t just me and Pam in the room, honest.  ;-)<br/>

I probably had a typo.  Terrrible typos for me lately.  I’d like to say something is wrong with my fingers, but seems not.<br/>
Maybe my brain.  Maybe I’m tired.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I didn’t find it, but I’m glad for this discussion.<br/>
<br/>
I’m just added something to my page on unexpected benefits, and surprising happenings.  It’s in keeping with this topic, because it’s about a teen who has been cocooning for a while.  That’s not mentioned; I’m adding it because I know the family and am very glad to know them.<br/>
<br/>
Top of the side box on the right.<br/>
<br/>
I don’t think it’s going to show well on a phone; sorry.  Use a larger screen.  Several of the stories there should be inspiring. :-)<br/>
And the format isn’t finished; I’m working on it now (8:38 a.m. in New Mexico on Thursday morning, which only affects a few people reading it at that moment :-) )<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Joyce, for this and lots of things.<br/>
<br/>
