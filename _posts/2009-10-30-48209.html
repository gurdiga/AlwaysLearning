<div id="ygrps-yiv-253082663">I thought this was pretty interesting and that some people might enjoy <br/>
seeing it. My son sent this email to his principal yesterday when he <br/>
decided to stop going to 10th grade.  She had asked if he would be <br/>
willing to meet with her to get feedback, and he decided that sending an <br/>
email would be an better way to express himself. He has been unschooling <br/>
until this September, and decided on his own to try this charter school <br/>
this fall. I told him I would leave out identifying info when I sent it <br/>
(not trying to protect the school.) He did this on his own. Usually he <br/>
asks me to review anything he has written before showing it to another <br/>
adult, and I was expecting that, but then he just sent me this, and said <br/>
he had sent it already.<br/>

So, as you probably have heard I am leaving (name of school) and being <br/>
homeschooled again.<br/>
My decision isn&#39;t a reflection on the quality of the teachers or <br/>
curriculum at (name of school).<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t like that some of the other students would disrupt the learning <br/>
process sometimes.<br/>
There&#39;s probably going to be some degree of that in any school though. <br/>
Right?<br/>
<br/>
I am an individual that has a good idea of how I want to learn, how I <br/>
want to spend my time, and what I want to focus on.<br/>
High school doesn&#39;t really work so well for me.<br/>
There is a set course of learning set out for me and I don&#39;t have as <br/>
much of a say in it as I would like to.<br/>
<br/>
I think overall it was a positive experience to try school for a short <br/>
while.<br/>
Even if it was just to see what it was like.</div>

I really like how positive and diplomatic it was!  He clearly gave feedback, made it very much about his experience and didn&#39;t say anything &quot;bad&quot; about school, except for his own personal account of his reasons, which he phrased kindly and gently.  Cool, too, that he even bothered at all!  Most kids in school would never take the time to give a response like that!<br/>
<br/>
I also like that he sent it via email rather than in person.  Email is a way more efficient way to get a point across, one that is often dismissed within a school setting, not among staff, but students.  <br/>
