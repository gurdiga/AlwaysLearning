After sunset on Friday and again on Saturday, Dec. 15th, high-latitude<br/>
sky<br/>
watchers should be alert for possible Northern Lights triggered by recent<br/>
solar eruptions.<br/>
<br/>
And finally, on Dec. 15th and Sunday, Dec. 16th, an unusually big and<br/>
bright near-Earth asteroid named 1998 WT24 will race across northern<br/>
skies. Amateur astronomers can see the approximately 9th-magnitude object<br/>
using modest backyard telescopes.<br/>
