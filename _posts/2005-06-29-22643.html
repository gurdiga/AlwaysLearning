<div id="ygrps-yiv-864373829">Hi Nicki,<br/>
 <br/>
I saw your intro and had a question about your sewing for the EC store.  What do you mean?...just a question from a mom who is starting to look for a work at home opportunity.<br/>
 <br/>
And, I&#39;m from Minnesoa...grew up in west central Minnesota, not far from Fargo-Moorhead.  And then as a new parent, I lived near St. Cloud.  I&#39;m in Virginia now...with mostly all of my relatives still residing back home.  What area are you in?  <br/>
