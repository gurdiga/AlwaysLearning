<div id="ygrps-yiv-1200013467">Hi.  I&#39;m Wende, unschooling my two great kids Ben (5, almost 6) and <br/>
Aliza who is 4.  I read several of John Holt&#39;s books while I was <br/>
pregnant with Ben, and we decided this would be the way to go for us <br/>
from the start.  I&#39;m by far the &quot;primary&quot; parent, but my husband John <br/>
(who travels a lot) is a super &quot;outide the box&quot; guy who keeps things <br/>
fresh and exciting.  We live in coastal SC.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve joined the group for some support and inspiration.  I belong to <br/>
an active homeschooling community, but most of the members are &quot;school <br/>
at home&quot; families.  I respect and am grateful for my local group but <br/>
sometimes have questions, musings and quandaries very specific to our <br/>
unschooling lifestyle.  I&#39;m pleased to have found myself here!<br/>

Wende, there&#39;s a cool thing not far from you in September.  A  <br/>
conference in NC.<br/>
