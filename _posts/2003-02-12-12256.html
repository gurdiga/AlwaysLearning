<div id="ygrps-yiv-2064644791"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I never hear myself complaining about my husband&#39;s mean mother or my drunken <br/>
&gt; confused mother without considering what kind of grandmother I might end up <br/>
&gt; being myself.   I wouldn&#39;t be patient and nice if my kids stuck bottles in <br/>
&gt; the mouths of perfectly good newborn babies without even trying to nurse <br/>
&gt; them, or put them in daycare centers at six or nine or 129 weeks. &lt;g&gt;  I&#39;d <br/>
&gt; probably say something!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have such a low opinion of my dil&#39;s mothering I was relieved when my <br/>
g-daughter was put into daycare at a home across the street - I thought that <br/>
mom might be nicer to Cassie, and Cassie would enjoy the company of the three <br/>
little girls.  Needless to say - this is the son that no longer has contact <br/>
with any of us in the family - it is a painful and difficult situation.  Not <br/>
at all what I had planned on!!<br/>
<br/>
My dil is the only woman I have known that stated after the birth that the <br/>
labor &quot;wasn&#39;t worth it&quot;.  It may have simply been for shock value.  Sad and <br/>
sick -- my son connected with her to save and rescue her.  Needing someone <br/>
feels alot like loving someone to a young innocent man.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve been lucky so far.  My daughter has taken the things I&#39;ve learned about<br/>
parenting and gone a few steps farther.  Now I often look to her as a<br/>
parenting model.  I have no idea what kind of wives my sons will pick.  I<br/>
can only hope.<br/>
