If you use that argument to explain to relatives, maybe change it from  <br/>
&quot;teach himself&quot; to &quot;learns on his own.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The less the word &quot;teach&quot; is running around in your head, the easier  <br/>
it will be to understand and to explain unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1614369267">Most of the misconceptions seem to me to obviously be based on a  larger<br/>
overall misconception that decisions for parents only have two extremes for<br/>
choosing from, even if the words &quot;always&quot; and &quot;never&quot; don&#39;t appear in such<br/>
misconceptions:<br/>
<br/>
--always leaving your kids alone or never leaving your kids alone<br/>
--always letting your children run wild or never letting your children run<br/>
wild<br/>
--always allowing children to do anything that comes to their heads or never<br/>
allowing children to do anything<br/>
--always using curriculum/workbooks or never using curriculum/workbooks<br/>
--kids always teaching (learning by) themselves or kids never teaching<br/>
(learning by) themselves<br/>
--kids always learning things considered &quot;academic&quot; or kids never learning<br/>
things considered &quot;academic&quot;<br/>
--kids always running the show or kids never running the show<br/>
<br/>
I think I could always be happy saying if unschooling means never punishing<br/>
a child, though life itself is not set up so a parent can guarantee that<br/>
children always &quot;gets away&quot; with everything, and, sure, some things I would<br/>
prefer for children to get away with. It&#39;s the nature of punishment that it<br/>
almost always unintentionally stirs up multiple problems on the way to<br/>
solving a single problem.<br/>
<br/>
I see these above misconceptions as only a few of the choices one might have<br/>
in parenting children. And the misconceptions don&#39;t sound very fun, for the<br/>
parent or for the child. It conjures up a picture of kids who &quot;have to&quot; have<br/>
supervision and direction at all times in order to do anything at all,<br/>
sitting or being still, not being very adventurous or independent, the only<br/>
thing acceptable for children to do is being academic showpieces for their<br/>
parents.<br/>
<br/>
The word &quot;sometimes&quot; in place of all those &quot;always&quot; and &quot;never&quot; words is but<br/>
a starting point, the tip of the iceberg, as to the many choices parents<br/>
*really* have. Sometimes, or as many times as a parent can spare, a child<br/>
can run about having fun and this can be much more fun with than without the<br/>
parent. With just that first &quot;sometimes&quot; I&#39;ve already found a little more<br/>
fun. Karl just had a blast playing games that he has left on the shelf for<br/>
months. He&#39;s old enough to know they&#39;re academic but it was fun for him. He<br/>
doesn&#39;t see them as dry or boring because he has the choice to play them or<br/>
not as he likes. In other words, sometimes he does things that could be<br/>
considered academic.<br/>

<br/>
ARE they &quot;academic&quot;?  They belong to an academy?<br/>
But Karl isn&#39;t academic.  So if he learns from something designed for  <br/>
teachers to use, he&#39;s still learning in a natural way.<br/>
<br/>
I think unschoolers shouldn&#39;t consider anything &quot;academic&quot; except  <br/>
maybe high-tuition school with uniforms.<br/>
<br/>
When kids don&#39;t need to prove their &quot;academic standing&quot; before playing  <br/>
sports or music or video games or attending their clubs or dance or  <br/>
martial arts classes... then how can their lives have any &quot;academic&quot;  <br/>
aspect anymore?<br/>

This is one of those little catches in unschooling discussions!  People don&#39;t teach themselves anything.  People learn.  Teaching is something that is done as an action to another, even if that action implies that the someone on the receiving end is learning.  The two are not the same.  Teaching is very different from learning and that difference is a big part of unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2103497381"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;Teaching is very different from learning and that difference is a big<br/>
 </span></blockquote>part of unschooling.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
The reason it&#39;s such a big part of unschooling is most parents who get into<br/>
unschooling are coming from a perspective of how things work in school,<br/>
having gone to school or been a school-at-home student themselves.  For<br/>
parents, teaching means instilling knowledge from the outside into the<br/>
child. The same is true for a child who has been a student either at home or<br/>
school. For them, learning is a much better word for getting the concepts of<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
For a child who has never been to school and has never been a student at<br/>
home, teaching probably means being mentored and having a choice as to when<br/>
to start or stop going to the mentor for information.  The word teaching<br/>
isn&#39;t likely to be as confusing for the unschooled child as it is for the<br/>
unschooling parent.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, it&#39;s something the unschooling parent could do well to learn<br/>
but it isn&#39;t an idea that has to be made clear to the unschooled child.<br/>

Good point.<br/>
That goes for most of unschooling.<br/>
I rarely ever talked to my kids about unschooling at all, in any way.  <br/>
I&#39;m taken aback, still, when I hear a parent talking to the kid all  <br/>
about how unschooling is and how it works.  In a good unschooling day,  <br/>
why talk about that!?<br/>
