<div id="ygrps-yiv-633480785"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; rats, or mice, or gerbils, or guine pigs?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Rats. Rats. Rats.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had mice (stinky), hamsters (VERY cute and can stuff TONS of food in <br/>
those pouches!),  guinea pigs (why bother?), gerbils (too skittish---like, <br/>
not quite &quot;domesticated&quot;), rabbits (beautiful and cuddly), and rats. We adore <br/>
Rhia and Olivia. They&#39;re funny, smart, cute, and absolutely delightful!<br/>
<br/>
The rat is, by far, the best rodent pet we&#39;ve had. They are terrifically <br/>
smart and easy to keep. They come in great exotic colors and coat textures. <br/>
If they get out (or someone forgets to put them back in the condo!), they may <br/>
wander a while, but they either come when called or eventually crawl up your <br/>
leg for attention. They love to ride in the car!<br/>
<br/>
They eat almost anything. We keep lab blocks in the cage at all times, but <br/>
they get pasta and salad and rice and salmon and oranges and nuts <br/>
and---basically whatever we have, they&#39;ll eat.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re SO trainable: I hosted a rat class last year---all the kids got <br/>
ratties (the first batch was 15!)---we each got two/three females. The kids <br/>
trained their ratties to do rope tricks, play soccer, swim and do water <br/>
tricks in the tub---among other things. A couple of the children got more <br/>
rats a few months later. <br/>
<br/>
We got them from a couple of breeders in FL. I&#39;d be happy to look in my <br/>
contracts for their names and numbers/addresses if you&#39;re interested. They <br/>
breed show rats (but ours are not show quality). These breeders handled the <br/>
babies from day one. They are VERY well socialized and healthy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-859113793"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;guinea pigs (why bother?)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hey.....I just have to step in here and defend the much maligned guinea pig. <br/>
;-)<br/>
<br/>
We have a piggy named Skittles, named because he is so skittish. Yes, he&#39;s <br/>
shy. Yes, he squeals in fright a lot and hides...but he&#39;s also friendly and <br/>
cuddly and loving. He comes out of his cage and runs freely through Conor&#39;s <br/>
room. He feeds from my hand and looks forward to our visits. He lets us hold <br/>
him and cuddle him and also lets us know when he&#39;s had enough and needs to <br/>
scamper away.<br/>
<br/>
We got him a dwarf rabbit as a bunk mate and friend and he has become much <br/>
more outgoing and brave. They are a joy to watch together. They both feed on <br/>
the guinea pig pellets and whatever fruit and veggie scraps we have on hand.<br/>
<br/>
Piggies are GREAT. You just have to understand them and learn to help them <br/>
be brave and a little adventurous. Hmmm...I&#39;ve got a kid like that. ;-)<br/>
