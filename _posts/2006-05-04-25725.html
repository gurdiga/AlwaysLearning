<div id="ygrps-yiv-103479442">&quot;yet she seems so creative, and can<br/>
entertain herself for hours, and enjoys herself, and I find her very<br/>
interesting, not much interest in TV, not bored.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think that children left to their own devices actually do a lot<br/>
better than overscheduled children. Partly I&#39;m sure it&#39;s genetics too.<br/>
I&#39;ve met a lot of very needy children that have non-attentive parents,<br/>
that&#39;s not so great.<br/>
I think creativity can flourish better with neglect than strictness<br/>
though. Neither is an ideal unschooling environment.<br/>

Isn&#39;t it sort of like the idea that &quot;I was parented such and so, and I turned out OK&quot;, or &quot;I went to school, and I turned out OK&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
How much more creative could a child be?  (Confident, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
How much more OK would many of us be if we had not gone through regular old school or been subjected to traditional authoritarian parents?<br/>
