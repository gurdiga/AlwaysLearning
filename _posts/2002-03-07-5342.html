<div id="ygrps-yiv-1570868987">Just had to brag.. the sheep and I both survived..LOL.. Are there any<br/>
handspinners on this list??  I have so much to learn. This is my first time<br/>
to do this..I chose my ram to experiment on..since he&#39;s so tough and the<br/>
most friendly. I could only save the best wool from his back..the rest was<br/>
way too dirty. I will have some hurting muscles tomrrow and a sore fingers<br/>
from working the hand clippers.. Only 2 more sheep to go!  Oh, I have the<br/>
cutest baby lamb too..one week old today... and also my first chicks<br/>
hatching..<br/>
Gee.. think I better join the &#39;homesteading&#39; homeschool list..LOL...<br/>
Julie in MO - I&#39;m almost finished reading Holt&#39;s.. How Children Fail..<br/>
book.. so very good... It sure makes me remember my school days!</div>
