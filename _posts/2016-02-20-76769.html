<div id="ygrps-yiv-1685085705">-=--=-Yes. I get that. So I was exploring Portuguese every day for hours because I’d chosen to. And not because I &quot;decided I wanted&quot; to do it?... :)-=—=-<br/>
<br/>
You explored it for a moment because you had chosen to.  Each moment, you could have kept going or stopped.  <br/>
If someone decides she wants to unschool, but leaves her kids in school and takes extra hours at work, and finds after-school classes for her kids, even though she claims to want to unschool, it’s just a fantasy.  It’s the wisp of a wish.  That’s not a crime.  <br/>
<br/>
If someone decides she wants to unschool but she doesn’t have custody of her children, and so doesn’t have the right to made decisions about whether or not they’re in school, then the desire will only made her sad.<br/>
<br/>
That’s all about clarity of thought. If English isn’t someone’s first language, this might be doubly irritating, but it’s still important to be as clear as possible.<br/>

-=-I’d never want to sell any philosophy or lifestyle to anyone. :)-=-<br/>
-=-Now, I do think we all have the right to be informed, and that you can’t make informed choices if you don’t have access to the information about what the options actually are. -=-<br/>
<br/>
“The right to be informed” is interesting.  How can you take away anyone’s right to be informed?<br/>
I’m not aware of every private school in the world.  When my children were school-aged, I did NOT know even all of the private school details in New Mexico—let alone neithboring states, or other parts of the U.S. or other countries.  IF one had wanted to go to a private school, would have had the right to be informed?  Could I have made an informed choice without all the options?   <br/>
<br/>
Whose job would it be to tell me about a boarding school in California, or Missouri, or Connecticut?  Salesmen.  Recruiters.  They might have reason to try to get their brochhures into my hands.<br/>
<br/>
I think people have the right to look for information, but we don’t have the obligation to press it on them.  At some level, it becomes rude to press information on people that they don’t want, or that they can’t use (legally, culturally practically).<br/>
<br/>
-=-I need to be mindful of my light and teasing nature when I write, because often I’ll be writing something with humor and don’t realize that I need to make that clear or it can be taken in the 1st degree. -=-<br/>
<br/>
You don’t need to be careful of teasing when you’re writing on your own blog, or to friends.  This discussion is intended to be on topic, clear, honest.  There are places to joke or to write recklessly and freely, but this isn’t one of them. :-)  So it’s more important to be mindful of where you’re writing, to whom, for what purpose.<br/>
