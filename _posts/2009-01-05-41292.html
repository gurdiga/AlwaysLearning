To anyone and everyone:  If you&#39;re going to put a link on this list,  <br/>
FIRST tell why and what and how it might be useful to the person  <br/>
who&#39;s going to look at it.  Before anyone goes to any links from this  <br/>
list, they should be given a clear idea of what it is and why it was  <br/>
posted.<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of this list is for discussions to occur on the list that  <br/>
can help readers of the list.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I read there, that lovely post about your son, and I didn&#39;t realize that you <br/>
were an unschooler, because you do talk about your child &quot;starting school&quot; <br/>
in an earlier post.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I think you are better off getting answers here, where they might <br/>
also benefit everyone else, than in the comments at your blog.<br/>
<br/>
I know there have been lists of stuff to do posted before, but I&#39;m at a loss <br/>
to think of the search terms.<br/>
<br/>
As for your dh, it is important to honor his need to feel secure that his <br/>
kids are learning. If I were in your position I would probably be a bit <br/>
retroactive - I&#39;d write out all the stuff that you have been doing. List the <br/>
outings and activities, and then spend some time talking about how great <br/>
these things are, how much she is learning, and perhaps help him see the <br/>
connections and interconnectedness of all knowledge (I mean how painting is <br/>
science, how cookies are small and large motor skills.) Perhaps ask him what <br/>
he thinks she would be doing all day long at school - she is young isn&#39;t <br/>
she?<br/>
<br/>
Also since he has time on his hands, perhaps he would like to take on some <br/>
special activities with her. My dh and dd spend a lot of time doing special <br/>
things together, including an invented board game, and a long term project <br/>
where they are following the construction of a dredge in the nearby harbor <br/>
complete with photo record and dedicated notebooks. As long as it doesn&#39;t <br/>
turn into a quiz session.<br/>

(That Heath Ledger example was given a couple of years ago. I was  <br/>
thinking of the connection between &quot;10 Things I Hate About You&quot; and  <br/>
&quot;The Patriot,&quot; which isn&#39;t the Civil War at all, but there are way  <br/>
more movies about the U.S. Civil War than about the American  <br/>
Revolution, though the recent mini-series on John Adams parallels it  <br/>
without many battle scenes.)<br/>

I have the oldest ..9 at home with me and the other 2 at school. The 5 year old because she really likes school 99% of the time and so far chooses to go. The 7 year old is severly autistic and it just works out better for the whole family for him to be in school at this time. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-862686960">What about just writing down all the interesting questions she asks?Â  <br/>
<br/>
I know this week we ave had lots of spelling questions, questions about the amount of sunlight per day, lots of talks about money, Harry Potter Questions, adding questions, multiplying questions, nutrition questions, etc.<br/>
<br/>
School would never bring up, and would certainly never answer so many questions. <br/>
