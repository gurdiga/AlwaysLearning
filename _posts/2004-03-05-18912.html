<div id="ygrps-yiv-746959266">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who have read my book HOMESCHOOLING REFLECTIONS, and/or were <br/>
at my book celebration last Friday, and met my kids, I wanted to share with <br/>
you the happy news that my son Shawn received today.<br/>
<br/>
When he was here last weekend he auditioned for grad school in theatre at <br/>
UCLA.  He was surprised to get the a call already today that he has been accepted <br/>
into the program.  It is perfect for him, since he hopes to act in film.  We <br/>
are all excited to get him moved much closer to home (he&#39;s now in PA, and we <br/>
are in San Diego).<br/>
<br/>
So, the answer is &quot;yes&quot;, homeschooled children can get into college, and grad <br/>
school too!!  (If you haven&#39;t read the book yet - Shawn attended kindergarten <br/>
at public school, and then learned at home until he started college when he <br/>
turned 21- he graduated from Clarion last Dec. after getting his lower division <br/>
credits here in San Diego, and in Houston TX.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so happy for him!<br/>
