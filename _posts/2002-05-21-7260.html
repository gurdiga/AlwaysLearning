&lt;&lt; I cannot remember his name but what a smile!  Brian, maybe?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do you remember his last name? Or his parents name. My family knows just <br/>
about everyone in Manning!! If he was off Hayward then his Dad probably grew <br/>
up with mine!!!  Wouldn&#39;t that be something?<br/>

&lt;&lt; Does anyone know any tips about how to do this? Also, a naive question: <br/>
 how does a travel agent make money? They don&#39;t charge the customer, <br/>
 correct? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The airline actually pays them a fee for booking.<br/>
They sometimes try to get stingy about it though!! <br/>

I love these plot twists when you find out you may have crossed paths<br/>
with someone before...  When I lived in Alaska I met an older woman who<br/>
had dated my dad&#39;s scoundrel brother in Seattle in the 50&#39;s.   She even<br/>
had pictures and gave them to me.  We kept in touch for a while until she<br/>
died.    Life is funny.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-119630977">I just had to reply about<br/>
funny-meetings-of-people--here&#39;s two...<br/>
<br/>
About 10 years ago I was driving across Washington<br/>
State, and there was a car that kept up with me...I<br/>
would pass it, it would pass me, I would pass it, on<br/>
and on for about 200 miles.  Well, I finally pulled<br/>
off at a rest stop, and that same car was there, so I<br/>
struck up a conversation with the driver, and old<br/>
Yakima Indian man...turns out he had gone to high<br/>
school with my grandfather on the reservation, about<br/>
60 years before. (we were still about 100 miles from<br/>
the reservation, so not like we were in an area where<br/>
anyone would know my grandpa...)<br/>
<br/>
Another time, again driving across Washington, in<br/>
winter, my car broke down outside of Hanford nuclear<br/>
reservation.  I pushed it to the guard shack, and a<br/>
man stopped to offer me a ride.  He took me all the<br/>
way home, which was about 50 miles out of his way.  In<br/>
talking to him, I found out that he had gone to<br/>
highschool with my uncle, also on the reservation! <br/>
This is not a large reservation!!  Pretty funny, I<br/>
though....just had to share.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-117378543">When I was in 1st grade in Punta Gorda, Florida in<br/>
1954-55 I had a best friend named Pamey Croslin. <br/>
Towards the end of the year my teacher. Mrs. Karahur<br/>
(from Germany) told me that a Little French Boy was<br/>
going to move to Punta Gorda, and it had been arranged<br/>
for him to be in her class and I was to be a Special<br/>
Friend to him. The family was delayed, and we moved to<br/>
Orlando for the summer and then to Ocala in the fall.<br/>
We missed. I was very disappointed.<br/>
<br/>
In 1968 when I started at FSU I met my 1st husband in<br/>
my German language class.  One of his house mates was<br/>
Chris VonChamier who became a special friend. He later<br/>
taught German at FSU (he was fired because he gave all<br/>
of his students &quot;A&quot;) Mrs. Karahur was his family&#39;s<br/>
sponsor when they immigrated to the USA from Germany<br/>
via France.  He was the Little French Boy that I<br/>
didn&#39;t meet until 1968.  His (later) wife (they had 5<br/>
children before they got married and divorced and<br/>
still live together) is a special friend mine, too. <br/>
Their son Christoff Wolfgang Michael VonChamier is my<br/>
Godson, and is still Huck&#39;s (DS2) best friend. My<br/>
oldest two DS and Michael were together all the time,<br/>
even though we lived about 50 miles apart.  Michael<br/>
just stayed with us...<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and Chris dated Pamey Croslin in HS. And Chris was<br/>
adopted by the psychiatrist, Dr. VonChamier, who<br/>
turned out to be quite horrible (WWII wrecked him). <br/>
<br/>
Chris and Chloe&#39;s 4 daughters used to sing a ditty<br/>
with altered words that emabarressed Huck. &quot;I got<br/>
lucky, and married a Hucky....&quot;  :-)  <br/>
<br/>
And they were unschoolers, extrodinaire.....with one<br/>
of the twins  being accepted into Veterinarian School<br/>
in Georgia at age 11 (pending graduation from<br/>
HS...ooops....she&#39;s attending the (very)Alternative<br/>
High School in Tallahassee, now.  The school colors<br/>
are a rainbow. My DS2 and Michael (Godson) graduated<br/>
there. She&#39;ll get there.<br/>
<br/>
Sharon of the Swamp......there are others, too,<br/>
equally convoluted<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
