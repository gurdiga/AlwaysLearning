another belly laugh.  that&#39;s two in a row.  you know this is weird. <br/>
since i&#39;ve been de/unschooling, i&#39;ve noticed how much more myself i<br/>
feel and happier.  only a month ago i was feeling pretty crazy and<br/>
uncomfortably over-focused or something --like i couldn&#39;t see or feel<br/>
as the situation(s) naturally and normally would call for.  I knew i<br/>
was in overkill mode but i ignored it.<br/>
<br/>
still nak, <br/>
