<div id="ygrps-yiv-1582360954">Not the same thing, but a boy Dylan knows  just participated in a weekend<br/>
camp where kids walk on hot coals.  Can you believe anyone has that much<br/>
liability insurance??<br/>
Anyway, they build a huge bonfire and while it&#39;s burning down they tell<br/>
stories and drum and dance around the fire and when the kids are ready,<br/>
they dance over the hot coals.  Willow&#39;s mom said he did it 15-30 times. <br/>
He had no burns on his feet but the hair on his legs was singed off. <br/>
He&#39;s 13 but there were even younger kids there.  <br/>
<br/>
Not saying Brit should build a bonfire or anything...&lt;g&gt;<br/>
But kids are doing brave stuff.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>What a fun camp. We used to go to festivals back home in the UK <br/>
where you could firewalk if you wanted too. I was always too <br/>
chicken and at that time they wouldn&#39;t let kids under 10 do it. Now <br/>
dd is 10 and wants to firewalk but I was beginning to think here in <br/>
lawyer-land I would never be able too. Glad to see they have <br/>
wrapped everybody up in cotton wool.<br/>
