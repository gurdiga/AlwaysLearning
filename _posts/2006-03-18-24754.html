<div id="ygrps-yiv-32185593">Back in January I started a blog  with the express purpose of creating <br/>
a space where people can be a fly on the wall of our unschooling life.  <br/>
I am LOVING the process!  Today&#39;s post was just so interesting to me <br/>
that I thought  would post it here.  There were no great philosophical <br/>
realizations, just a brief peek into the amazing joy that our family <br/>
has every day.  Spring is almost here and I am feeling grateful for <br/>
everything--it is really all so simple.  I just thought I would share!<br/>

  Archimedes and Nancy Drew<br/>
<br/>
Evie&#39;s grandma is in town (Scott&#39;s mom) but she is not feeling well so <br/>
we are in between full-on grandma time and regular life. Evie had a <br/>
double grandma day yesterday, much to her delight. They went to the <br/>
University of WI Geology Museum then to a gymnastics open house and out <br/>
to lunch. My mom and Evie brought the other grandma home and then went <br/>
out to the farm for frolicking. We went to a great St. Patrick&#39;s Day <br/>
party last night and then I got to attend the birth of a dear friend. <br/>
Boy, being a doula was a great job. I can&#39;t see getting back into it <br/>
any time soon though, the hours are killer!<br/>
<br/>
This morning Evie and I finished the latest Nancy Drew we were reading. <br/>
Nancy extricated herself from a closet using a pole as a lever.<br/>
Evie said, &quot;Hey, Archimedes! Wasn&#39;t he the bathtub and screw guy too?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Huh?&quot; I asked.<br/>
&quot;You know, displacement and all that.&quot;<br/>
  &quot;Where did you hear about that?&quot; I asked.<br/>
&quot;I think it was in a comic book, let&#39;s measure displacment using a <br/>
measuring cup, and egg and milk.&quot;<br/>
  &quot;Okay.&quot;<br/>
Yikes! What interesting connections!<br/>
<br/>
Evie turns six on Monday, I can&#39;t believe it. She is having a Paradise <br/>
Island (Wonder Woman&#39;s home) themed b-day party. The main event is to <br/>
be creating a castle our of old boxes. That is what she asked for, that <br/>
is what she is getting. She also asked for a double chocolate cake <br/>
decorated with green frosting and Wonder Woman pictures from her books. <br/>
She is getting that too. She is also getting way cool presents from <br/>
Scott and I. I won&#39;t write about those until &quot;the&quot; day!<br/>
<br/>
We are going out for Indonesian food tonight with grandma. After <br/>
trapeze this morning Evie came home to play with friends and they have <br/>
been reenacting the Nutcracker ballet all afternoon. I have been <br/>
putzing and enjoying the sunshine.<br/>
<br/>
A day very well lived!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Keep this in mind:  Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead—the movie  <br/>
version, not the play itself—has some visual stuff on the side, and  <br/>
part of it is displacement, involving a wooden bathtub, and a paper  <br/>
boat. Maybe she wouldn&#39;t be interested, but maybe you would!  And  <br/>
maybe you&#39;d like those scenes if nothing else.  It&#39;s just lately on  <br/>
DVD and stars Gary Oldman, Tim Roth and Richard Dreyfuss.  It&#39;s about  <br/>
Hamlet, and philosophical ideas, and humor and answering questions  <br/>
with questions and stuff.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One of my favorite movies (and plays) of all times.  I first watched it <br/>
at the same time I saw &quot;My Dinner with Andre.&quot;  What a combo!  Thanks <br/>
for the reminder, I haven&#39;t watched it in years and can still see the <br/>
bathtub scene clearly!<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>
