Someone who&#39;s in the SCA (I don&#39;t know her) posted this link to some  <br/>
documentation she&#39;s found about the history of backgammon.  I LOVE  <br/>
games history.  It ties in to lots of things, when people find period  <br/>
boards carved into benches and tabletops or on ships...   when they  <br/>
find game boards, or pieces or paintings.  It&#39;s art and social  <br/>
history and geography...<br/>

It&#39;s only one of the many things that connects what we do and have  <br/>
today back hundreds of years.<br/>
