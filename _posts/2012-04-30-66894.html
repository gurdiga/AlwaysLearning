<div id="ygrps-yiv-878463536">hi all,<br/>
just a couple of questions.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
my dd is 11 and i am finding myself &quot;unable&quot; to think of things to do with her.  she has her interets which i support and enjoy with her.  but i get the feeling that it is not enough for her.  she is happy enough and when i ask if we do enough she says she thinks we do, so maybe the angsty feelings are just from me.  with my younger two (8 and 6) they are happy with play dough, drawing, trampoline jumping etc. but and here&#39;s where i know my thinking is off , with my eldest it just doesn&#39;t seem enough for her, to satisfy her.  i suggest outings and we do go to some places but she is happy to be at home most of the time on the sofa, watching tv and messaging friends on facebook.  she wants me to organise a party (not birthday just general) and i wonder if she is looking for the excitement and busyness that will bring.  she sees friends regularly.  <br/>
also she is quite tearful at times and gets down if she feels wronged by friends.  and sometime she says she doesn&#39;t know why she feels sad.  i wonder if her hormones are beginning to kick in, or is that too general?  <br/>
thanks<br/>

There will be time to go out more.  If she&#39;s happy, let it slide for a while.<br/>

<br/>
Holly was that way at that age.  I think it was partly hormones, and partly she had friends who were careless and a little cruel.  She went for a while without many friends, and that started to change when she was 13, 14, I think.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Maybe just the fun of organizing and participating in something sparkly and different.  Special food, decorations...  Sounds fun!<br/>
