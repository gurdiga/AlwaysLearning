I&#39;m curious if speech/physical/occupational therapies have been discussed on this list in the context of unschooling?

My youngest girl is currently in a private speech therapy program. She enjoys it (and is excited to attend every week), but it feels very much like &quot;school&quot; to me. There&#39;s a significant amount of repetitive drill and we have &quot;homework&quot; worksheets.<br/>

If she&#39;s very young, and it&#39;s something she will figure out on her  <br/>
own, then maybe just decide by whether she&#39;s having enough fun to  <br/>
justify the expense and time.  Maybe she is!  But unless she has a  <br/>
physical problem and really needs therapy, it might be something that  <br/>
could make her feel something is wrong with her, and that learning  <br/>
requires professional intervention.<br/>

<br/>
It has been talked about.  In general, I think it really depends on how old the child is and what the issue is.  The risk is that the kid ends up feeling like something is wrong with them, when often, speech issues resolve themselves with time.  There are things that a therapist could help with, what immediately comes to mind is cleft palette or other abnormality that has been surgically fixed.  If it&#39;s a 5 yr old that can&#39;t pronounce certain letters, or is having a hard time enunciating, there are better ways to help than speech therapy. <br/>

From what I read in the archives, it does seem that there are instances where different therapies can mesh with unschooling and have positive results, but there are also instances where they can do more harm than good. Ultimately, it comes down to knowing and trusting your child.<br/>

I totally agree that physical and occupational therapies are good things for children/people with disabilities. I would think that it totally depends on the therapist&#39;s approach, though. <br/>

I&#39;m not Sandra, nor would I tell her what to put on her website, but if it were me, I wouldn&#39;t put it up there.  It&#39;s not unschooling.  It&#39;s therapy.  Speech therapy is one of those new school &quot;fix the child&quot; issues.  It&#39;s not that speech therapy can&#39;t help kids that need it or that there isn&#39;t a useful place for it the world.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s kind of like unschooling an autistic child.  It works the same way whether your child is autistic or not.  The details will be different, but the basic ideas will be the same.<br/>
<br/>
If your child really needs speech therapy and your child really likes it, then it seems like a good idea to do it if you have the resources.  If your child has been diagnosed at the age of 5 by a kindergarten teacher that can&#39;t understand him or her, speech therapy might not really be necessary.  If you have a child that really needs speech therapy and they really dislike it, then people here could probably help search out alternatives.  Those alternatives may be in the archives.  I&#39;ve read at least one speech therapy thread a year for about 10 yrs now (0n average, that&#39;s about how often it comes up).<br/>
<br/>
When Chamille was 4, she&#39;s 16 now, speech therapy was starting to be really big in schools as a special needs program that involved some sort of expert to help kids.  <br/>

That actually wasn&#39;t my point.  My point was more that *I* wouldn&#39;t want to see it on Sandra&#39;s site and I gave my reasons... Sandra, is of course free to do what she wants with her site.  Helping kids get along with more traditional therapies and other things might be an interesting thing to put up there on her site and if she did do that, I&#39;m sure she&#39;d find the best of the best of all that has been written about such things to put in there.<br/>

<time>22 Jun 2010, at  4:21am</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-808460278">My son has what is diagnosed as a mild to moderate stutter. When he was <br/>
younger, maybe age 7/8, his dad wanted him to be in speech therapy, <br/>
which we did through the school district we lived in, and then at the <br/>
clinic at the college near us, with grad students. Neither made a huge <br/>
difference, and he hated it. He quit at around age 13/14 when we gave <br/>
him that choice, when my husband had become comfortable with allowing <br/>
that choice.<br/>
<br/>
This year he has chosen to go back- he is 17. He felt the speech issue <br/>
was getting in his way, preventing him from meeting new people and doing <br/>
what he wants to do- which is playing in bands which involves a lot of <br/>
communication. He has said that part of it is as important as being able <br/>
to play an instrument. Now he feels he is getting something from it - <br/>
and is engaged in the therapy. All the reports from the therapist <br/>
emphasis how motivated he is. The therapy involves a lot of practice in <br/>
varied situations- and his confidence is increasing. He still has <br/>
&quot;disfluencies&quot; as they call them, but he is confident that this will not <br/>
prevent him from being understood when he wants to communicate. His <br/>
wanting to do it has made the therapy useful to him.<br/>
<br/>
I get a newsletter from the Stuttering Foundation - and read things in <br/>
there often that getting kids into therapy early is the only solution. <br/>
So I wonder - if only we had gotten him to therapy much earlier- we <br/>
could have prevented the issue all together. I guess we will never know. <br/>
What it important is that my son is a confident person who is pursuing <br/>
his dreams and seems to have as many friends as he wants to have.<br/>

&gt; My site leads to Joyce&#39;s from LOTs of pages.  Lots of other sites too.<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t feel bad about people coming to my site for lots of answers<br/>
&gt; because I haven&#39;t built one of those sites that traps people like a<br/>
