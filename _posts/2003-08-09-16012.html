<div id="ygrps-yiv-229200864">The home school group here in Burke County had a &quot;snake presentation&quot; <br/>
scheduled today at a local park to be given by a park ranger.  My boys thought it <br/>
would be too cool.  When we got there I only recognized a few people so started <br/>
talking.  Turns out not many people in this group know about unschooling, LOL.  <br/>
The typical question was &quot;when do you start school&quot;  &quot;Oh we&#39;re unschoolers so <br/>
we don&#39;t start and stop.&quot;  Followed by &quot;what is unschooling?&quot;  I basically <br/>
said &quot;we have no curriculum, we just live life and learn as we go along...&quot;  <br/>
along with other things the basic response was &quot;oh that&#39;s interesting&quot; with the <br/>
look that says &quot;you freak.&quot;  (remember I live in school at home country) LOL  <br/>
Didn&#39;t bother me.  Then the ranger started his presentation with a discussion <br/>
of insects and spiders.  To which my boys piped up with &quot;we have a black widow <br/>
and a tarantula as pets.&quot;  OK if they thought I might be weird then the moms <br/>
were sure of it now.  LOL.  So many looks that said &quot;you are such a bad bad <br/>
mom...tsk tsk tsk&quot;  LOL<br/>
<br/>
Although I did feel real good when my boys were able to carry on a <br/>
conversation with the ranger.  Not just spitting out facts but a conversation.  Then I <br/>
just sat back, relaxed and new things were good and we were going to have a <br/>
great day.  They loved it.<br/>

<br/>
Do they want any more black widows?<br/>
<br/>
Last year I brought tumbleweeds and goat heads to the conference (missed the <br/>
distribution and so didn&#39;t get to give my EXCELLENT speech &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
I kill black widows when I see them, but if someone really wanted one, I&#39;d be <br/>
willing to try to bring one.  Though maybe you can&#39;t, now, bring them on <br/>
airplanes.  Probably  you shouldn&#39;t be able to.  Carrying poisonous stuff from <br/>
where it&#39;s native to where it&#39;s not might shouldn&#39;t be legal anyway.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-265740175">what a great post.  This is so much my experience so often.  <br/>
<br/>
Today my dad and I were talking about how the Romans had indoor baths <br/>
and indoor plumbing and what happened between then and 1600&#39;s.  Lexie <br/>
joined in the conversation and was talking about the dark ages and maybe <br/>
fear and superstition had something to do with it.  She was so confident <br/>
in her knowledge of history and life that she wasn&#39;t intimidated, he <br/>
knowledge was just as good as ours!  :0)<br/>

airplanes now.  I know you can&#39;t bring knitting needles, not sure about <br/>
crochet hooks, and also sewing needles are off limits. LOL. Tried that.<br/>

<br/>
This afternoon I was listening to Man of La Mancha while nobody else was <br/>
here.  I was thinking about how confident Holly had been one day when she was ten, <br/>
about the song &quot;Little Bird,&quot; when she said &quot;What does THAT have to do with <br/>
ANYTHING?  It doesn&#39;t even fit in the story!&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
She was right.  And Marty agreed with her.<br/>
<br/>
When I was 10 and 13 I had never heard of ANY musicals except Peter Pan and <br/>
Wizard of Oz, and I didn&#39;t know there were stage productions, just thought they <br/>
were movies.<br/>
<br/>
When I was an older teen and started knowing a little more about musicals, I <br/>
still don&#39;t think I would have been  that easily analytical about style and <br/>
content of songs.  I would have assumed that other people knew something I <br/>
didn&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
So yes!  Unschooling can make kids brave and thoughtful people who can hold <br/>
their own!<br/>

<br/>
A friend of mine was in a custody battle, over power, but the theme was <br/>
homeschooling.  Mom went to court a few weeks ago and got an emergency <br/>
order to put the child in Kindergarten.  Not even manditory here.  He <br/>
went to court yesterday and again today, we had Pierre this afternoon <br/>
while he was in court.  Dad won!  He has won the right to make ALL <br/>
educational decisions, so Pierre will go to school next week to say <br/>
&quot;good bye&quot; and then he will be homeschooled!  I am so thrilled.  <br/>
<br/>
Brad took Pierre and Janene and Lexie to see Peter Pan, the musical.  I <br/>
am home alone.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I never even thought of sewing needles.  I ripped my dress a little <br/>
on the way to the airport last week, so I bought a little sewing kit <br/>
when we got there to fix it.  They never noticed it when we came <br/>
home, and it didn&#39;t set off the alarms (like the buckles on my Birks <br/>
did).<br/>
