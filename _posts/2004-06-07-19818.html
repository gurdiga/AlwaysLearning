all about the little homeschooled outcast relative who comes to stay and go<br/>
to real school, but has trouble because he&#39;s a nerd.<br/>

pretty funny; none of them are at the expense of unschoolers &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-490458524">You can also look for books where the storyline takes place outside of school.  For instance, Edward Eager&#39;s Magic series - the adventures take place during the summer.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-779847375">Well, I can&#39;t think of any picture books but for a chapter book read aloud you<br/>
could try &quot;Surviving the Applewhites&quot; by Stephanie S. Tolan.  My children and I<br/>
really enjoyed it.  Definitely unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1470812066">Pippi Longstocking comes to mind.  Also, Eloise is tutored at home. Both <br/>
of these are about kids living separate from their parents, so not <br/>
exactly homeschooling families, more homeschooling children but... <br/>
<br/>
I would also look at the Chinaberry (http://www.chinaberry.com) and <br/>
F.U.N. Books (http://www.fun-books.com/) catalogues.  Maybe one of them <br/>
would have something?  There are certainly lots of lovely books that <br/>
deal with life outside of school, summer vacations, etc.  But I don&#39;t <br/>
know about specifically unschooling families. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-522118201">Not quite what you want, but we love Hooray for Diffendoofer Day!  by Dr. Seuss. It is about a school - but is very unschooling (the children learn to THINK !!!!). To quote<br/>
<br/>
Or school is at the corner<br/>
Of Dinkzoober and Dinzott<br/>
It looks like any other school<br/>
But we suspect its not<br/>
I think we&#39;re learning lots of things<br/>
Not taught at other schools<br/>
Our teachers are remarkable<br/>
They make up their own rules.... <br/>
<br/>
We think Diffendoofer school is the nearest a school can get to homeschool!! What a shame Dr. Suess died before he could take it that one step further.<br/>
