<br/>
I appreciate your comments Pam.  That&#39;s pretty much<br/>
why I shared what I did to begin with, and why I<br/>
shared it here.  I have been on Shine for quite a<br/>
while now, and have had some discussions there that<br/>
I&#39;ve been involved in.  It is a very good thing to<br/>
have the supportive understanding of a group of folks<br/>
with special needs kids who are unschooling, in the<br/>
same way as it&#39;s a good thing to have the support of<br/>
unschooler here.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure others here can relate, having an atypical<br/>
parenting style, to how it gets exhausting to always<br/>
have to educate others in social groups or public<br/>
setings who come questioning you and to be a poster<br/>
child for unschooling and how it can also be so<br/>
refreshing to have someone just totally &quot;get it&quot; and<br/>
be on the same page with you.  It&#39;s to a much greater<br/>
degree with special needs kids, because it&#39;s more<br/>
obvious generally and people come up to you in places<br/>
like the supermarket and get all sanctimonious and<br/>
judgemental on you because they see your apparently<br/>
&quot;normal&quot; 9 year old down on the floor having a<br/>
tantrum, or hear them speak to you in a way that<br/>
others percieve as rude, or because your child is<br/>
doing some other thing that irks someone.  I know a<br/>
number of folks who carry or have recommended to me to<br/>
carry a small card to hand people saying that my child<br/>
has special needs and I appreciate their patience,<br/>
support and understanding (even if those people are<br/>
showing none of those things.)  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been on various other unschooling lists as well. <br/>
However bar none this list, Alwayslearning, has been<br/>
the best unschooling support list for me all around,<br/>
more so than Shine.  I&#39;ve been here since this list<br/>
was started (I remember asking why it was so quiet and<br/>
being told that no one was here yet, lol - oh!) as a<br/>
spinoff from another list, and have always found this<br/>
to be an opinionated and honest, fair, sincere and<br/>
thoughtful group of folks with a lot of great<br/>
experience to share, masterfully lead by Sandra with<br/>
her mostly hands off approach to list management.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to share here how we struggle with the<br/>
philisophical and practical applications of our<br/>
principles in unschooling our special needs kids, and<br/>
I&#39;m glad that I did because I can see that it has so<br/>
far been a beneficial discussion to members here both<br/>
with and without special needs kids.<br/>
<br/>
I have learned a HUGE, HUGE amount from parenting my<br/>
kids and I am so thankful that they are who they are. <br/>
No regrets, no searching for &quot;cures&quot; to make them<br/>
&quot;normal.&quot;  On thing I have learned from them is to<br/>
relax and not stress over things that a lot of parents<br/>
stress over.  Our challenges are different and it<br/>
really puts things in perspective.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes - that comes across loud and clear! It makes me glad - sometimes  <br/>
my heart just aches so much for all those kids who are thought of  <br/>
almost entirely in terms of their &quot;problems,&quot; and seldom in terms of  <br/>
their true individuality. I&#39;m so happy that I do know people with  <br/>
what we might call &quot;quirky&quot; kids of all kinds who are treated as the  <br/>
whole person that they are - including acceptance of their personal  <br/>
idiosyncrasies.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes - and that perspective - those challenges - often provide much  <br/>
wisdom. I appreciate that you and others are willing to share it.  <br/>
I&#39;ve benefitted so much from what I&#39;ve learned from parents of kids  <br/>
with more extreme behaviors - my own kids are VERY intense and  <br/>
probably could have been diagnosed with various things if they&#39;d been  <br/>
in school. But I&#39;ve paid attention - when people talk about kids who  <br/>
have nerves that seem to be quickly rubbed raw in social situations,  <br/>
for example, I listened to how people helped their kids and supported  <br/>
them AS THEY ARE. I used much of what I learned with my own kids.<br/>
<br/>
Also - there are so MANY kids with autistic spectrum behaviors - I&#39;m  <br/>
not sure how anybody these days would not have friends who are  <br/>
autistic or have autistic kids. Not that it makes anybody responsible  <br/>
for educating others about it, but that we ALL have a vested interest  <br/>
in understanding how to relate to people with autistic spectrum  <br/>
behaviors as the real, complete, wonderful people that they are.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-308773275">To me, principle based parenting is more about creating a loving atmosphere;whereas rules based parenting focuses on a legalistic set of do&#39;s and dont&#39;s. I know exactly what you mean about not wanting to be a &quot;COP.&quot; It&#39;s just not worth it and the children don&#39;t want or need a cop for a mom.</div>
