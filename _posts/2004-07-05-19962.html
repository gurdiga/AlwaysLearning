<div id="ygrps-yiv-16695147">Lexie says that she has three questions she hates people asking her....<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Is that your mother?&quot;  (or some variation of how can you have a white <br/>
mother.)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What grade are you in?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What school do you go to?&quot;  (Lexie said, not only are these last two <br/>
gramatically incorrect, but they are just plain annoying!)<br/>
<br/>
So any ideas what she could say to these questions?  She wants quick, <br/>
pat answers that will shut people up.  Or should I say, shut up <br/>
people...although in that case up is not a preposition.... oh man, now I <br/>
know where lexie gets it. <br/>

Yes.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Rain used to use meat grades - prime, choice, stuff like that. I thought<br/>
it was funny. Now she&#39;s taken to looking overly clueless - &quot;Grade? Oh,<br/>
grade... hmmmm.... I think 6th, or maybe 5th...?&quot; But then, Rain enjoys<br/>
the whole thing, so that&#39;s different. It doesn&#39;t seem to come up much<br/>
anymore, somehow. Mostly it&#39;s other moms who bring it up.<br/>
<br/>
I think it was probably harder a couple years ago, when she was Lexie&#39;s<br/>
age. Then she was  more factual, like, &quot;If I went to school I&#39;d probably<br/>
be in 5th.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
She used to have real trouble remembering that grades changed in the<br/>
fall... she kept assuming that they changed whenever you had a birthday.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
Since we just moved to a new town, we get these questions all the  time.  <br/>
Will usually hands them off to me, but I don&#39;t know why because he&#39;s  heard me <br/>
answer them a hundred times.  It&#39;s especially hard on him  when a kid is asking <br/>
while I&#39;m not nearby.  He usually comes and gets  me.<br/>
 <br/>
I usually say he&#39;s homeschooled, and the kids here &quot;get&quot; that without  having <br/>
to ask more.  But they do want to know what grade he&#39;s in a  lot.  So I will <br/>
say, teasingly, &quot;there&#39;s only one kid in his  school; what do we need grades <br/>
for?  He&#39;s 10!&quot;  I don&#39;t particularly  like referring to him having a &quot;school&quot;, <br/>
but the point now, here, with new  people, is to help him avoid embarrassment <br/>
or feeling &quot;different&quot; or &quot;odd&quot;,  which seems to be an issue with him lately. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
He really wants me to step in with adults, because their questions can be  <br/>
more pointed.  He hesitates to use the word &quot;homeschooled&quot; for some  reason. I <br/>
have heard him say he was &quot;unschooled&quot; to one kid, though, but  then he <br/>
couldn&#39;t explain it to the kid&#39;s satisfaction and asked me to explain  it.  The kid <br/>
lost interest, but I doubt he&#39;ll be willing to use the word  again except in <br/>
the right circumstances and/or when he gets more confidence in  handling people.<br/>

Oh yeah, I try to remember what grade Will would be in had he been in  school <br/>
(easy for me since his brother was born at the same time of year and went  to <br/>
school).  I pass it on to him but he chooses not to remember or  somethng.  <br/>
Sixth grade this year.  The same grade Jon was in when we  started <br/>
homeschooling!<br/>

<br/>
I may not be able to contribute good answers.  But I know these <br/>
questions.  I used to get similar questions when I was young.  My <br/>
stepdad is black.  And my youngest sister looks much like him!  <br/>
Before she was born, though, people would ask me... is that your <br/>
dad????  I&#39;d just say, &quot;yeah.&quot;  lol.  And they&#39;d just look puzzled.  <br/>
Later my sister (2 years younger than I, and about 16 at the time) <br/>
was out with my youngest sis (about 1 at the time)  someone asked <br/>
her, &quot;Where&#39;d you get that baby!!!???&quot;  uh... like she had stolen <br/>
her or something.  That was messed up.  <br/>
<br/>
As for the schooling questions.  Jay gets this a lot at the <br/>
playgrounds, etc.  He says, &quot;I don&#39;t go to school.  I&#39;m <br/>
homeschooled.&quot;  And, &quot;I&#39;m not in a grade.&quot;  sometimes he&#39;ll <br/>
elaborate and say what grade he *would* be in were he in school.  <br/>
The most annoying question we get is in response to &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
homeschooled.&quot;  They invariably ask, &quot;WHY??&quot;  um... <br/>

I guess that sometimes when she identifies you as her mom she gets impolite responses from the inquirer, and she is trying to suppress that if she can?<br/>
<br/>
To the question &quot;Is that your mom?&quot;  I&#39;m almost tempted to reply &quot;What do you think?&quot;   (I&#39;m not suggesting this be said with a snippy attitude.)<br/>

That&#39;s exactly what we did with my kids.  They still have to think when <br/>

<br/>
When they were little and asked &quot;What grade would I be in?&quot; I would go by <br/>
birthdays.  Kirby has a summer birthday so his age is &quot;right&quot;/ideal.  Mine was <br/>
too when I was a kid, so I know fifth graders are 11, because I was 11.  By the <br/>
end of the year most of them were 12 &lt;g&gt;.  <br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t long before none of us cared what grade someone would&#39;ve been in.<br/>

<br/>
I really like that idea.  I think I will start an all new dialog with kids I <br/>
meet in the future.  I&#39;ll say &quot;Do you got to school?&quot; even if they&#39;re 14 years <br/>
old.  It&#39;s simple turnabout for the hundreds of times my kids have been asked <br/>
&quot;Where do you go to school?&quot; and &quot;What grade are you in?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Fantasy moment:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Me:  &quot;Hi.  Do you go to school?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Stranger:  [puzzled look, looking at me like I&#39;m crazy after that] &quot;Yeah.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Me:  &quot;Really?  How come?&quot;<br/>
(questions that often  come after &quot;we don&#39;t go to school,&quot; for my kids)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Nah, but that might serve to make more people unhappy in the world.  And the <br/>
answer to &quot;how come&quot; about school is that their parents make them, or their <br/>
parents had no idea about homeschooling, or they and their parents no longer <br/>
like each other well enough to consider homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Some things are better left undisturbed, I think.<br/>

be doing certain things by certain ages, like leaving home or going to <br/>
university next year, for instance. I&#39;m curious how you (and others) think <br/>
about kids being ready to move on from home. Lars would graduate next <br/>
spring if he&#39;d been in school. All his friends go to school, and some <br/>
graduated this year. From their parents I hear a constant pushing. &quot;Get a <br/>
job, etc.&quot; It feels like they&#39;re in such a hurry to push their kids out <br/>
into the world. Even dh has talked about how Lars might want to be on his <br/>
own soon.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2130033515">My mountain-biking, film-editing, free-spirited brother went to<br/>
Evergreen State College (a WA state college where students design their<br/>
own major and do tons of independent study - very unschooling-friendly).<br/>
He created films about workers during the Depression and about his<br/>
friends, mountain bikers and on-the-cusp musicians.  After he finished,<br/>
and after a several year hiatus when it seemed he was just hanging out<br/>
with friends, camping on various and sundry couches in the Pacific<br/>
Northwest, playing guitar and riding bikes with his dog, he found<br/>
construction.  As a hands on, free spirited guy, he loves it.  He gets<br/>
to work with his hands, he can take a break if he wants to - just stop<br/>
taking jobs, he works a regular day and has the evenings free to do what<br/>
he wants (reading history, riding mountain bikes, playing guitar,<br/>
whatever) while my PhD husband has to work long hours and spend time at<br/>
home doing work, too.  He and his wife and daughter are happily buying<br/>
fixer-uppers, fixing them up, and renting and/or selling them.<br/>
Construction has been a good fit for him, even though it started out as<br/>
a way to earn enough cash to take his girlfriend out to dinner<br/>
occasionally :-)  <br/>
 <br/>
Not to say it will be a fit for Lars - who knows?  But your description<br/>
of him reminded me of my brother so I thought I&#39;d share his story.<br/>
 <br/>
Also, there are a couple sports-oriented guys who work at a local<br/>
sportsplex as coaches to young kids.  The coach at the homeschool class<br/>
we go to teaches kickball, soccer, volleyball, whiffleball, etc.  I<br/>
don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a full-time career job for any of them, but they<br/>
certainly seem to enjoy working there sharing the sports they love with<br/>
kids.<br/>
 <br/>
And finally, any language and math skills he would need will probably be<br/>
acquired on the job just as easily.  When I got my first position after<br/>
college I was amazed at how much more I had to learn on the job.  It was<br/>
much easier to learn how to prepare molar solutions because I had to for<br/>
my job than it was in the abstract in college.  I&#39;m sure the same is<br/>
true for journeyman carpenters/electricians/plumbers/etc.  If he has any<br/>
interest in learning any job, see if you can find someone willing to let<br/>
him shadow them for a day (or a week, or whatever).  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll find something he loves to do (or something he can do to<br/>
pay bills so he can do the thing he loves) - it sounds like he&#39;s good at<br/>
following his interests :-)<br/>

apprenticeship, and that requires some pre-apprenticeship training at the <br/>

of them, but you have to know the math or be able to read and write <br/>
reasonably. It&#39;s coming, just not there yet.<br/>

&quot;grow up&quot; at his own speed. I don&#39;t get that locally. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

This website gives a good description of her injury <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dynomed.com/encyclopedia/encyclopedia/pediatric_orthopedics/Fracture_of_the_Condyle_of_the_Distal_Humerus.html">http://www.dynomed.com/encyclopedia/encyclopedia/pediatric_orthopedics/Fracture_of_the_Condyle_of_the_Distal_Humerus.html</a><br/>

Tomorrow she will get the stitches out from having the pins removed.  She still cannot straighten or bend the arm fully, but is getting closer every day.  She has 2 two inch scars on her inner elbow.  She has a scar on the outside of the same elbow from an unfortunate run in with a puppy&#39;s teeth last summer!<br/>

She is having problems with them accepting some of her credits.  They want to give her a 2.0 for classes she is transferring, because Evergreen doesn&#39;t give grades.  They give detailed evaluations instead.  Because she is now pursuing a degree in a competitive field, her GPA could make a difference.  She is neither a teen nor an unschooler, so her experience may be irrelevant to an unschooled young person.  I thought I&#39;d mention it though.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
I wanted to go to college.<br/>
I was surprised when I got there to fine LOTS and lots of kids who had not <br/>
wanted to be there, but their parents forced them.  Some of them were told <br/>
exactly what classes to take, by their parents.  Some were cut off financially if <br/>
they changed majors.   Of those kids I&#39;m thinking of, they were all from out of <br/>
state.  When their parents demanded college, the kids chose far, far away.   <br/>
I don&#39;t think those things were unrelated at all.<br/>
<br/>
So the kids were wild and sneaky and more prone to cheat because their <br/>
purpose was not learning, their purpose was making their parents just satisfied <br/>
enough to keep paying for it and to not rag on them too too much.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby is going to be 18 by the end of the month.  He talks about taking <br/>
classes sometimes but he&#39;s not in a hurry.  I could rush him, but then it would be <br/>
me, not him.    There&#39;s a branch of a local trades school/kind of jr. college  <br/>
half a mile from where he works, and the university I attended is maybe ten <br/>
miles away.   He&#39;s never talked about leaving town to go to school.    He likes <br/>
it here.  He likes us.   Yet I know there are friends and relatives who see <br/>
that as wrong, and see a desperate desire to get the hell away as &quot;success&quot; of <br/>
some sort.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not thoughtful.  It&#39;s not right.  It doesn&#39;t make sense.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1295519495">We&#39;re in the midst of this as well. My oldest &quot;graduated&quot; this year.<br/>
(Nothing has really changed, but she wanted a graduation party so we<br/>
&#39;graduated&#39; her).  A number of her friends graduated (from school or<br/>
school-at-home) this year and have been busy getting into colleges and<br/>
planning the rest of their lives and seeing how fast they can move out. We<br/>
are not in a financial position to send our kids off to college...so that<br/>
route was never an option anyway.  Kate has one job supervising a church<br/>
nursery and just got hired at Target for a 2nd job. Target was the first<br/>
interview she has ever went to that she didn&#39;t have an &quot;in&quot; (in other words,<br/>
she didn&#39;t already know someone or been referred by someone). After two<br/>
interviews in one day, she was hired on the spot. They never even asked<br/>
about her education. This isn&#39;t what she wants to do with the rest of her<br/>
life, but she&#39;s very excited to be there for the next few years...and it<br/>
will put her through Community College which is her next goal.  This goal<br/>
could change in the next year or two...maybe she sill like it at Target and<br/>
want that to be her career....now she has a chance to find out. She will be<br/>
working 3 jobs, she has her own car, she is planning a trip to Europe to<br/>
visit her Aunt this fall, and she has time to spend with her siblings. She<br/>
volunteers with teams her younger brothers are a part of, she will be<br/>
assisting their drama group, she isn&#39;t going to disappear out of their lives<br/>
just because she is 18.  She is almost an adult...but she is still growing<br/>
and changing.....she values and loves her independence...but isn&#39;t<br/>
interested in moving out yet.  She house-sat for an Aunt this weekend and<br/>
came home knowing she would never want to live alone....she did not like<br/>
that.  Moving out would not give her a lot more freedom than she already has<br/>
and unless she found some room-mates, would drive her crazy.  Maybe she&#39;ll<br/>
change her mind in a few years or a few months...or maybe not. With all she<br/>
is doing and accomplishing, people still think it&#39;s odd that she is<br/>
willingly staying home and staying involved in the lives of her<br/>
family....like that&#39;s abnormal or something.  Fortunately, we&#39;re long past<br/>
caring what anyone thinks and we happily go on with our lives....<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;<br/>
  &gt;Kirby would have graduated from high school last month, if he had gone.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  This is something I&#39;d like to talk about. I know you don&#39;t expect Kirby to<br/>
  be doing certain things by certain ages, like leaving home or going to<br/>
  university next year, for instance. I&#39;m curious how you (and others) think<br/>
  about kids being ready to move on from home. Lars would graduate next<br/>
  spring if he&#39;d been in school. All his friends go to school, and some<br/>
  graduated this year. From their parents I hear a constant pushing. &quot;Get a<br/>
  job, etc.&quot; It feels like they&#39;re in such a hurry to push their kids out<br/>
  into the world. Even dh has talked about how Lars might want to be on his<br/>
  own soon.<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t have a problem with him wanting to get out on his own, whenever<br/>
  that happens. But I also don&#39;t want him to feel pushed. He still hasn&#39;t<br/>
  figured out what he wants to do with his life. His major interests<br/>
  (softball, soccer, mountain biking, and film editing) don&#39;t look like they<br/>
  lead into careers, except the film editing, but his interest there is<br/>
quite<br/>
  narrow (mountain biking videos).<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve encouraged his involvement with all of those. We&#39;ve also talked about<br/>
  blue collar trades, since he&#39;s such a hands-on guy. He doesn&#39;t like book<br/>
  learning and really dislikes writing. I know for the trades he&#39;s going to<br/>
  need a certain level of math and language arts, depending on the trade.<br/>
  I&#39;ve told him we&#39;re glad to help when he wants to work on those things. He<br/>
  says he does but doesn&#39;t do much about it. No problem. I&#39;m not in a hurry.<br/>
  Any thoughts on this?<br/>
  Tia<br/>
  ps Even though he still isn&#39;t playing because of his broken arm, his team<br/>
  won the right yesterday to represent Western Canada in the International<br/>
  Softball Congress in Fargo, ND next month. It&#39;s fairly certain he&#39;ll be<br/>
  playing again by then. Yippee!<br/>

That&#39;s a LOT.<br/>

There are high school grads who have never had a job, will never go to <br/>

There are adults who went to school *and college* who have never had a job, <br/>
will never go to Europe, don&#39;t have cars, dont like their siblings, have never <br/>

<br/>
-=-With all she<br/>
is doing and accomplishing, people still think it&#39;s odd that she is<br/>
willingly staying home and staying involved in the lives of her<br/>
family....like that&#39;s abnormal or something. -=-<br/>
<br/>
If normal means common or average, it IS abnormal.  <br/>
It&#39;s wonderfully superior to normal. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Kirby has had a job for most of four years (early August, it&#39;s four years).<br/>
FOUR YEARS.  And he&#39;s 17.  He&#39;ll be barely 18 when it&#39;s four years, because <br/>
they hired him at barely 14, and would&#39;ve hired him earlier had the law allowed.<br/>
<br/>
There are adults working there.  Four of them.  I mean past-40-yr-olds.  <br/>
Kirby outranks one of them.  Two are owners.  There are other kids working there, <br/>
a few.  College, high school.  Kirby outranks them at work.   It&#39;s a part time <br/>
job, it doesn&#39;t have insurance and fancy benefits, but he has learned tons <br/>
there, and he&#39;s trusted by adults, and treated well.  He doesn&#39;t make enough to <br/>
make a house payment and a car payment (though he could certainly make a car <br/>
payment if he wanted that more than he wanted gaming supplies and conventions). <br/>
 If he asked them for more hours, they would probably give them to him.  <br/>
Lately he&#39;s asked for more time off, because he has medieval camping obligations, <br/>
and went to a gaming convention near Dallas.  He&#39;ll go to an anime convention <br/>
in Denver in September, and probably a gaming convention in southern <br/>
California in December.<br/>
<br/>
How is that worse than having a first semester of college, taking English <br/>
101, math 100 (he doesn&#39;t know notation, but is chock full of concepts and <br/>
math-in-his-head), biology, karate and history?   (At great expense; the books alone <br/>
might cost more than all his upcoming conventions.  And at the end of <br/>
December he would be still a college freshman.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just not finding it in me to be agitated. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
And the calm feels good.<br/>

Marty&#39;s interested in the police academy, but he can&#39;t go until he&#39;s 21.  He <br/>
might not care by then.  That&#39;s five and a half years away.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1493915246"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ouch!  Lisa (11) broke her arm on a trampoline a couple of months ago, in <br/>
&gt;a similar way.  She went on to her arms on the tramp and must have twisted <br/>
&gt;the wrong way.  This website gives a good description of her injury <br/>
&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dynomed.com/encyclopedia/encyclopedia/pediatric_orthopedics/Fracture_of_the_Condyle_of_the_Distal_Humerus.html">http://www.dynomed.com/encyclopedia/encyclopedia/pediatric_orthopedics/Fracture_of_the_Condyle_of_the_Distal_Humerus.html</a><br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ouch! I&#39;m glad it was the head of the radius that Lars broke.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Tomorrow she will get the stitches out from having the pins removed.  She <br/>
&gt;still cannot straighten or bend the arm fully, but is getting closer every <br/>
&gt;day.  She has 2 two inch scars on her inner elbow.  She has a scar on the <br/>
&gt;outside of the same elbow from an unfortunate run in with a puppy&#39;s teeth <br/>
&gt;last summer!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Pins? Yikes! They didn&#39;t even cast Lars&#39; arm. The doc knows he&#39;s an <br/>
athlete, and he wanted to preserve the strength and mobility of the arm and <br/>
elbow. It was hard at first to keep him comfortable without a cast. He <br/>
started with a sling, but that didn&#39;t do the trick. He kept bumping it and <br/>
sleeping on it, etc. Then the doc put on a half cast, which helped until <br/>
the pain was less. The half cast was held on with a tensor bandage. Then he <br/>
discovered an elbow brace, an elastic sleeve that goes around the elbow. <br/>
That&#39;s done the trick, and now he rarely needs it. He&#39;s got full range of <br/>
motion and almost complete strength. He&#39;s been using a tennis ball for <br/>
therapy, his own idea. He just holds it and squeezes it while watching TV <br/>
or whatever. It seems to have really helped.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;Evergreen State College (a WA state college where students design their <br/>
&gt; own major and do tons of independent study - very unschooling-friendly)&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My neighbor has a degree in sociology from Evergreen.  She has returned to <br/>
&gt;college for a second degree in a different career.  She is having problems <br/>
&gt;with them accepting some of her credits.  They want to give her a 2.0 for <br/>
&gt;classes she is transferring, because Evergreen doesn&#39;t give grades.  They <br/>
&gt;give detailed evaluations instead.  Because she is now pursuing a degree <br/>
&gt;in a competitive field, her GPA could make a difference.  She is neither a <br/>
&gt;teen nor an unschooler, so her experience may be irrelevant to an <br/>
&gt;unschooled young person.  I thought I&#39;d mention it though.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That would definitely be a consideration. I doubt Lars will be going to <br/>
colllege in the States though, even if he does go to college somewhere.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;Yeah. I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll figure something out. I know he could get a job at the<br/>
&gt;bike store if they had enough business. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Maybe he could offer to volunteer.<br/>
&gt;If he&#39;s a regular &quot;worker&quot; and becomes knowledgeable of their routines, and<br/>
&gt;shows himself reliable, maybe he&#39;ll get the next open position.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He&#39;s done a lot of that. Both the previous owner and the current one let <br/>
the boys come in and use the shop tools to work on their own bikes, with <br/>
the owner offering advice, etc. It&#39;s been a really nice mentoring <br/>
relationship for him. Of all the boys, Lars seems to be the one willing to <br/>
help out when the store gets busy if he&#39;s there. In fact it was helping out <br/>
there that made him realize that his writing needs work. His spelling is <br/>
still so bad that he&#39;s uncomfortable with having to write anything down at <br/>
the store. He realized that he&#39;d have to improve it if he ever wanted to <br/>
run his own business. He just hasn&#39;t gotten around to doing anything about <br/>
it yet. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&lt;&lt; I guess what I&#39;m really looking for is validation for letting him<br/>
&gt;&quot;grow up&quot; at his own speed. I don&#39;t get that locally. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I wanted to go to college.<br/>
&gt;I was surprised when I got there to fine LOTS and lots of kids who had not<br/>
&gt;wanted to be there, but their parents forced them.  Some of them were told<br/>
&gt;exactly what classes to take, by their parents.  Some were cut off <br/>
&gt;financially if<br/>
&gt;they changed majors.   Of those kids I&#39;m thinking of, they were all from <br/>
&gt;out of<br/>
&gt;state.  When their parents demanded college, the kids chose far, far away.<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t think those things were unrelated at all.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A couple of Lars&#39; friends who just graduated are going to university in <br/>
Victoria, an hour&#39;s drive away. They&#39;ve convinced their parents to let them <br/>
live in the dorms next year, &quot;for the experience&quot;. I think they just want <br/>
to get away. Now those same parents are complaining about the cost of <br/>
sending them to university . . . sigh. Lars knows that he could live at <br/>
home while going to the community college, but we could never afford any <br/>
other kind of help. But he doesn&#39;t need to get away in order to experience <br/>
freedom. He&#39;s got that here.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Kirby is going to be 18 by the end of the month.  He talks about taking<br/>
&gt;classes sometimes but he&#39;s not in a hurry.  I could rush him, but then it <br/>
&gt;would be<br/>
&gt;me, not him.    There&#39;s a branch of a local trades school/kind of jr. <br/>
&gt;college<br/>
&gt;half a mile from where he works, and the university I attended is maybe ten<br/>
&gt;miles away.   He&#39;s never talked about leaving town to go to school.    He <br/>
&gt;likes<br/>
&gt;it here.  He likes us.   Yet I know there are friends and relatives who see<br/>
&gt;that as wrong, and see a desperate desire to get the hell away as <br/>
&gt;&quot;success&quot; of<br/>
&gt;some sort.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This was what I needed to hear. Thanks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1393257181">This is something that pops in my head every now and again too.  My<br/>
eldest is 14.  Almost all of my friends whose children attend school<br/>
make constant reference getting their children to leave home -- and<br/>
some of them even talk about remodeling their kids&#39; rooms so they<br/>
can&#39;t move back home!  It makes me sad to hear people talk that way<br/>
about their children -- I wonder how safe their kids feel inside their<br/>
homes, or if they even feel at home in their homes with their parents<br/>
all the time talking about getting them out the moment they turn 18 of<br/>
graduate from high school. Those parents have adversarial<br/>
relationships with their kids -- I always hear them arguing and<br/>
shouting at each other.<br/>
<br/>
I just can&#39;t imagine my son leaving home in four or five years.  I<br/>
think he wants to go to college because when we&#39;ve visited college<br/>
campuses he&#39;s really expressed joy at the being surrounded by an<br/>
academic environment.  The two colleges that he&#39;s indicated interest<br/>
in attending are in-state and one is right in our local community. <br/>
Another friend whose daughter has expressed interest in attending the<br/>
same school said that even though that school is right in our own<br/>
backyard, she&#39;s going to insist that her daughter live in the dorms<br/>
because &quot;it&#39;s part of the college experience.&quot;  When I share my<br/>
thoughts about not looking forward to the day when my child leaves the<br/>
nest, they all tell me -- &quot;Just wait a couple of years -- then you<br/>
will!&quot;  Will I? Don&#39;t think so! This nuclear nest-shoving is an<br/>
unnatural state of being for families.  How did we ever get to the<br/>
point where it became the expected &quot;norm&quot; to separate from the family<br/>
at age 18 or 21?  Isn&#39;t that just another institutionalized<br/>
school-directed imposition on family life?  At what cost to society? <br/>
 What is the supposed benefit of having children leave home so early? <br/>
