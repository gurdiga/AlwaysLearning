<div id="ygrps-yiv-924953735">Hi all -<br/>
When I started giving away books and knicknacks and clearing the shelves, I <br/>
wondered what it would look like to have empty-ish shelves......I was <br/>
concerned about empty shelves - being a researcher/reader, myself and a one <br/>
time HGTV junkie (that&#39;s Home/Garden channel) ......But when ds made a boat <br/>
with paper and tape, I had a place to put it....and now the BOOK shelves have <br/>
some books, some cherished &#39;stuffs&#39; and our art work - and I love the <br/>
displayed art!......funny, imo, how it all works out.....how letting go in <br/>
one area allowed for such joy in another!<br/>
<br/>
If books are your thing....GREAT!  Books I haven&#39;t touched in years are not <br/>
my thing....that was a hard self portrait to accept as I love book learning <br/>
too.....but I &#39;went there&#39;, passed along books to other people, and feel <br/>
better about the contents of my home.....<br/>
<br/>
Did I need to explain why I get rid of BOOKS....?  Does it seem too strange <br/>
to let go of BOOKS?  To me, it has been an act of passing along that which <br/>
has already been useful to me.....or that which will not be useful to me <br/>
again and could be useful to another.....<br/>
<br/>
Have a good day!<br/>
Jane<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s a site I got on one of my writing lists.<br/>
www.bookcrossing.com<br/>
The gist of it is that you put a sticker on books you want to &quot;send out&quot; <br/>
and then you leave them somewhere you think they might be found by a person <br/>
who would appreciate them.  I think the sticker directs the person to the <br/>
site, where if you&#39;ve registered, you get to find out where the book went <br/>
and if it was appreciated.  I thought it was kind of neat, but I hardly <br/>
ever get rid of books.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
