<div id="ygrps-yiv-1283537579"><p dir="ltr">Hello all,</p>
<p dir="ltr">We are 3 months into our radical unschooling journey.   At first, we were trying to get out and do a lot of activities.   For the past month or so my kids don&#39;t really want to leave the house much.  They prefer to stay and play minecraft, video games, jump in the trampoline,  and just hang around.  My husband wants me to do more outside things with them and I always offer but the only one who ever wants to leave is my toddler (almost 3, others are 5, 7, 10).  I think this must be par for the course for deschooling and I&#39;m curious to hear thoughts regarding this.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Thank you. </p>

<div><font size="4">HI Megan</font></div>
<div><font size="4"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="4">playing minecraft, video games, jumping on the trampoline and
just hanging around are as much the stuff of Unschooling as going out and about
a lot, if your children are choosing these things and prefer them to other
activites at the moment. I find it to be a constantly changing feast. Their
choices rarely remain the same forever. </font></div>
<div><font size="4"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="4">Unschooling doesn’t equal getting out and doing lots of
activities. Unschooling to me is also about lots of down time and think time and
“appearing to not be doing much” time. SO much learning and processing is going
on in these times too, not just during those times when you’re out exploring and
the learning seems much more apparent, to us.</font></div>
<div><font size="4"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="4">Our children have never been to school. They still, especially
our just turned 7 year old, much prefer to stay at home than go anywhere so I am
not sure its part of the deschooling process. </font><font size="4">Then they love
to go out and do something different sometimes. Not all the
time.<br></font></div>
<div><font size="4">Why does it concern your husband that they want to hang out at
home and no go anywhere? Does it concern you? Are you happy to stay home or
would you prefer to be out doing things a lot?</font></div>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I totally agree! We each have times we would rather be home than anywhere else. But my kids will often jump at the chance to do something fun as a family. Having their Dad around, or going with another family, adds a component of enjoyment to activities.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it can be difficult to see the value of being at home. If you or your husband believe learning happens outside the home, this is something to explore as you deschool.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And there are so many fun things to do at home. Someone recently shared these with us:<br/>
http://www. Pixelpapercrafts.com<br/>
Http://www.instructables.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-minecraft-papercrafts<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some of the other fun things we do at home -<br/>
&quot;Painting day&quot; where we each paint on stretched canvas or decent quality watercolor paper.<br/>
Board games<br/>
Building things with Legos or boxes or playdoh or magnetic kits or wood, hammer, nails<br/>
Baking and cooking<br/>
Vegetable garden and yard work<br/>
Minecraft!<br/>
Skyping with friends<br/>
Creating Let&#39;s Play videos and posting to YouTube<br/>
Playing Barbies (sometimes these are recorded and sent to YouTube also)<br/>
Sewing with the machine<br/>
Swinging in the tree swing<br/>
Riding bikes<br/>
Playing with the hose and buckets (with or without washing the car)<br/>
Watching tv or movies or YouTube<br/>
Walking the dog<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When there is so much to explore at home, it might not seem necessary to leave.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Read a little about Learn Nothing Day. It is something that reminds me how learning works and helps me see the connections my kids are making all the time. (Sometimes we plan our own &quot;unofficial&quot; Learn Nothing Day at other times of the year so we can all affirm how we are learning all the time.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1066732107"><p>Today my daughter (6, never been to school) was painting and we were talking a bit and she said &quot;I like to stay home because all my toys are here.&quot;&nbsp; It is pretty simple for her! Then she asked me why I like to go out so much.&nbsp; I thought about the standard &quot;because it&#39;s good for you&quot; or &quot;gotta make Vitamin D&quot; sorts of answers.&nbsp; But then I realized those weren&#39;t really my reasons at all.&nbsp; I&nbsp;realized (and told her)&nbsp;that some of my favorite toys are sunshine, trees and fresh air!&nbsp; She thought that was kind of silly but it was a nice conversation and she could feel that I wasn&#39;t telling her that she had to like my toys, just that I liked them.</p><p><br></p><p>I also realized that I don&#39;t have many &quot;toys&quot; or hobbies that I enjoy indoors.&nbsp; So I&#39;m looking around for ways to expand in that area.&nbsp; Window box gardens have been an in-between for me.&nbsp; Sometimes just opening all the windows helps me get over that &quot;stuck inside&quot; feeling.&nbsp; Maybe that would help you?</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Best,</p><p>Anita<br class="ygrps-yiv-1066732107yui-cursor"></p></div>
