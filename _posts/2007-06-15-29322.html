<div id="ygrps-yiv-256831305">In my opinion, it depends on what state you are in.      If you are in one<br/>
of the &quot;private school states&quot;  , particularly if in a state that private<br/>
schools that are private in more than name (in other words, are not<br/>
government regulated and controlled);  then it is not an issue at all.<br/>
Many of the concepts of unschooling  have been recognized for decades in<br/>
certain institutional private schools.<br/>
<br/>
If you are in one of the states that has ALL schools under the jurisdiction<br/>
of the state educational authority,  then you might need to be a little more<br/>
creative in acting as a buffer between your children and bureaucrats.   Same<br/>
thing if you are in one of the states that sets up special and different<br/>
requirements for  &quot;Home schools&quot; .   Doesn&#39;t make unschooling illegal, just<br/>
means that you need to remind yourself how to &quot;translate&quot; what your children<br/>
are doing naturally into bureaucratic language.<br/>
<br/>
I am continually bemused that those who scream loudest about the fundamental<br/>
rights of parents to raise and educate their children are often the same<br/>
folks declaring that unschooling is NOT legal.<br/>
<br/>
vicki<br/>
<br/>
P.S.:  One thing to consider is whether your mindset is such that you think<br/>
that to be &quot;legal&quot;  something has to be specifically listed as legal.    The<br/>
United States legal system is based more on the concept that what is  &quot;not<br/>
illegal&quot;  can be considered &quot;legal&quot;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s no such legal concept as unschooling, is what I said.  You  <br/>
can&#39;t just tell the government &quot;I&#39;m unschooling and unschooling is  <br/>
legal because I read it in a magazine.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling is legal, and every single unschooling parent needs to  <br/>
understand his/her own state law and how learning works and what  <br/>
their intentions and plans are so well that he or she can discuss it  <br/>
intelligently when and if necessary.<br/>
<br/>
There are ideas for descriptions here:<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Homeschooling is legal in all 50 states, and yes, most people in the<br/>
homeschooling community see unschooling as a subset or particular<br/>
approach to homeschooling. I&#39;m not aware of any language that<br/>
specifically calls &quot;unschooling&quot; illegal.<br/>
<br/>
However, as Vicki said, how you go about unschooling *legally* depends<br/>
on your state. I don&#39;t mean that you must do unschooling differently -<br/>
just that if your state has strict laws or heavy oversight, you may<br/>
have to find a creative way to comply with your state&#39;s requirements.<br/>
<br/>
To begin with, there is no reason to use the word &quot;unschooling&quot; when<br/>
talking with or writing to any school or state official. It&#39;s very<br/>
likely that they would either be confused because they don&#39;t know what<br/>
you&#39;re talking about or become alarmed because they have<br/>
misconceptions about unschooling. This could lead to problems that are<br/>
avoidable if you stick to the word &quot;homeschooling&quot; (or whatever your<br/>
state calls it - home education, home instruction, etc) when it comes<br/>
to any official correspondence or communication.<br/>
<br/>
Some states require that parents keep attendance. In my opinion, if my<br/>
child is awake and present on Earth, then s/he is learning something.<br/>
You don&#39;t have to sit a child in a desk and declare it a &quot;school day&quot;<br/>
to count them as &quot;present&quot; on an attendance sheet.<br/>
<br/>
Other states require that you give them a description of curriculum or<br/>
lesson plans. In this case you can translate their unschooling,<br/>
day-to-day learning into &quot;school speak&quot;. There are many resources<br/>
online that can offer suggestions and advice on how to do this. People<br/>
in the educational system are more comfortable with paperwork that<br/>
uses familiar wording and phrases.<br/>
<br/>
There have been and probably always will be an unknown but relatively<br/>
small number of homeschoolers & unschoolers who decide to fly under<br/>
the radar and choose civil disobedience rather than attempting to<br/>
comply with the state&#39;s laws, for whatever reason they feel it&#39;s<br/>
necessary. I personally wouldn&#39;t recommend this because it&#39;s risky in<br/>
many ways and more often than not families can find a way to<br/>
unschooling and meet state requirements, but each person must<br/>
determine their own path. There is the option of moving to another<br/>
state if you are unhappy with the laws where you live.<br/>

<br/>
There are quite a few states in which we might talk about  <br/>
&quot;homeschooling,&quot; but, in fact, it isn&#39;t, itself, a legal option. In  <br/>
those states, people have figured out how to go ahead and homeschool  <br/>
while establishing themselves officially as private schools or  <br/>
enrolling in some kind of umbrella school in order to be legal.<br/>
<br/>
People have gotten themselves into trouble by insisting that  <br/>
&quot;homeschooling is legal,&quot; in states where thousands of people may be  <br/>
homeschooling, but it isn&#39;t called that in the legal sense.<br/>
<br/>
The magazine article went beyond even that, and said that unschooling  <br/>
was legal. It is pretty clear that the authorities, from school  <br/>
district officials on up to state legislators, didn&#39;t intend to  <br/>
legalize unschooling, and that we&#39;re pretty much all taking advantage  <br/>
of the fact that they don&#39;t even really understand what we&#39;re doing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There is language in most, not quite all, homeschool laws and private  <br/>
school regulations that say that kids have to be taught some specific  <br/>
subjects. &quot;We&quot; interpret that through our unschooling lenses and say,  <br/>
&quot;Kids will learn what they need to learn in a rich a stimulating  <br/>
environment with supportive adults.&quot; But, the intent is clearly to  <br/>
require teaching and we&#39;re not doing it.<br/>
<br/>
Alaska probably has the &quot;best&quot; homeschooling law in the country. It  <br/>
simply says that if the child is being educated in the child&#39;s home  <br/>
by a parent or legal guardian, the child is exempt from compulsory  <br/>
attendance. There are no qualifying, reporting, registering, or  <br/>
educational requirements at all of any kind.<br/>
<br/>
EVEN in that most free of all states, Alaska, however, notice that it  <br/>
says &quot;if a child is being educated...&quot;  If authorities wanted to make  <br/>
a case that unschooling didn&#39;t meet the legal definition of  <br/>
&quot;educating,&quot; they&#39;d probably have most educational experts on their  <br/>
side and, therefore, very likely win in court.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t usually talk much about the legal issues on our discussion  <br/>
lists - this one or the others - because our interest is in talking  <br/>
about learning and life as unschoolers. The legal stuff you each have  <br/>
to figure out based on your own state laws, court decisions in your  <br/>
state, and how things work &quot;in practice&quot; in your area. None of that  <br/>
changes anything about how kids learn or how unschooling works.<br/>
<br/>
It is probably good to point out, once in a while, that unschoolers  <br/>
are doing something that might possibly get them into some legal hot  <br/>
water if they don&#39;t make sure they are knowledgeable and confident  <br/>
enough to do/say what is necessary to any authorities in order to  <br/>
protect their own freedom to unschool.  That includes not saying,  <br/>
&quot;Unschooling is legal,&quot; or insisting on calling it &quot;unschooling,&quot;  <br/>
even to authorities or others who have no reason to know of it or  <br/>
understand it.<br/>

Yes.<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s one reason (though rarely explained) that experienced  <br/>
unschoolers can get quickly exasperated with people who seem to need  <br/>
to be spoonfed information.<br/>
<br/>
Figuring unschooling out IS strange and odd sometimes, but if someone  <br/>
really can&#39;t understand it while lots of confident people are making  <br/>
suggestions and making pointers, the odds of her getting it going  <br/>
well at home and maintaining it for years and defending it when and  <br/>
if needed are not so strong.<br/>
<br/>
I know that sometimes newer unschoolers seem baffled that we&#39;re  <br/>
talking so much philosophy and so little (it seems to them)  <br/>
practicality and &quot;how to&quot; but it&#39;s because unschooling only starts to  <br/>
work after beliefs and viewpoints change.  There&#39;s not really a  <br/>
shortcut.  There&#39;s a bypass, which looks like unschooling that will  <br/>
work, but it&#39;s not sustainable if the parents don&#39;t really relax into  <br/>
it and expect it to be fun and good, and unless they do the work it  <br/>
takes to create the environment to allow it to work for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not as easy as it looks.<br/>
And it should take many hours a day (more parental-involvement at  <br/>
first than later; more with younger kids than older).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re right, that&#39;s true - we group may things under homeschooling<br/>
that technically and legally aren&#39;t considered homeschooling -<br/>
families functioning as private schools, as you mention, for example.<br/>
In addition to the home instruction laws here in my state we also have<br/>
religious exemptions and tutor provisions that are not considered the<br/>
same as homeschooling in a legal sense (but in reality are used that<br/>
way).<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I was trying to say (and should have been clearer in my<br/>
use of language) is that there is a way to do what would be commonly<br/>
considered &quot;homeschooling&quot; and &quot;unschooling&quot; (non-technical<br/>
definitions) in one way or another in all 50 states but the legal<br/>
hurdles and specific requirements vary from place to place. In some<br/>
states &quot;homeschooling&quot; is an acceptable word, other states may not be<br/>
as tolerant, depending on what educational avenues they expect<br/>
families to follow (like umbrella schools, etc).<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t read the magazine article, so I wasn&#39;t speaking to that, but<br/>
I can guess where they got the information ~ probably misuse of words<br/>
and an implied understanding on the part of the speaker that might or<br/>
might not actually have been understood correctly by the receiver. In<br/>
other words, just like what I did with my post - Oops!  I guess coming<br/>
from a place where homeschooling and even unschooling is not<br/>
difficult, I forget the difficulties others face elsewhere. It wasn&#39;t<br/>
my intention to exacerbate the problem - I will be more careful in the<br/>
future.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Right again. I was looking through my rose colored glasses. I realize<br/>
there are certain responsibilities that the intent of the law implies,<br/>
but after years of reading it and dealing with it my brain<br/>
automatically translates all school speak into unschooling terms now.<br/>
In hindsight, that&#39;s probably not the most accurate or useful way to<br/>
approach this topic when helping people who are trying to grasp a very<br/>
basic understanding. I apologize for any confusion.<br/>

reading the philosophy espoused here I start to get it.  Little by <br/>
little.  I did want answers when I started reading.  I kept wanting <br/>
to ask, &quot;Well what do I say when she does this?  What do I do about <br/>
this situation?&quot;  It&#39;s difficult to change philosophies and know what <br/>
to say and do. It is not an easy way to parent.  But I never asked <br/>
for easy anyway.  I do have to tell you though, my daughter and I are <br/>
