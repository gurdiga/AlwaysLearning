<div id="ygrps-yiv-921036261">I just posted a hello to Anne, and then realized it may have been at <br/>
unschooling.com list she posted to!! Sheesh.<br/>
AOL tried to merge my CS account and screwed my account up so that I <br/>
can&#39;t reply to any digests via my regular address. They are fixing <br/>
it, but in the meantime I have to actually log on to the list to post <br/>
anything!!<br/>
So forgive me if I accidentally post to the wrong list.<br/>
Was Anne here or am I totally mixed up?<br/>
Argh...<br/>
Ren</div>
