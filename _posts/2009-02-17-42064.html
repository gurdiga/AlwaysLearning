<div id="ygrps-yiv-1224028947">Reading the Beach High School web site made me want to enroll.  :)  But<br/>
mostly, it got me thinking about my sister, who has graduated high school<br/>
(10 years ago) but wants help figuring out what to do now.  She has a lot of<br/>
talent, but not enough skills to figure out what to do with her talent, or<br/>
how to find/make a job (or two or three) that she actually enjoys.  Does<br/>
anyone know if Wes Beach could help a situation like that, or if there are<br/>
people/places that might be able to help?  I thought about life/career coach<br/>
type people, but ugh -- I think something more real/tangible/hands on would<br/>
be better.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1448652060">That&#39;s probably something Wes could do really well, help someone write  <br/>
a resume to include what they&#39;ve done outside of those venues that  <br/>
give degrees.  Maybe I should get him to write ME one! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
