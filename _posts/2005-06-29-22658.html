<div id="ygrps-yiv-498217795">We were talking about grading here not long ago, and I just found something <br/>
really interesting:<br/>

   It&#39;s for a theology class.   I&#39;ve given the beginning (purpose) and the <br/>
end (grading).   The blog is the classwork, the project, the class participation <br/>
and the final.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Statement of Purpose for the Blog Project<br/>
<br/>
 Several biblical authors and subjects sought to improve dramatically the <br/>
worlds in which they lived. Similarly, this project asks you to make the world a <br/>
better place by identifying a problem and implementing a solution. Along the <br/>
way, you will reflect on how various biblical and non-biblical authors have <br/>
addressed similar issues. Additionally, in keeping with course goals, this <br/>
project seeks to improve your ability to think critically and to improve your <br/>
writing. Your blog (an abbreviation for web log) will provide a published <br/>
documentation of your thoughts, efforts, and means by which you personally improved the <br/>
world.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Week 14: Blog your thoughts on what your grade for this project should be and <br/>
why. Here are the criteria:<br/>
<br/>
 A = Nearly everyone in the class would agree that the project considerably <br/>
improved the world. Well written blogs documented the extensive work that went <br/>
into this project.<br/>
B = Blogged more than 1000 words every week. Quality writing was free from <br/>
grammatical errors. Project had a large scope and lasting duration.<br/>
C = Blogged 1000 words every week. Spelling and grammar had occasional <br/>
problems. Project contained much theory about what student would do, but little <br/>
concrete action that the student did do. Project scope was not very broad, and the <br/>
project&#39;s duration might be short lived.<br/>
D = Blogged less than 1000 words every week. Every blog had grammatical <br/>
problems. Project had little scope and short-lived duration.<br/>
F = Rarely blogged.<br/>
