&lt;&lt; Schuyley, I&#39;m sorry you are feeling so alone,   I know how it feels.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
There is a poster on this list who might have some reassuring words though!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
SHYRLEY!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Schuyler, did you hook up with locals there yet?<br/>
(See?  If I had responded a month ago, it would have been too soon! &lt;bwg&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Shyrley, I&#39;m sorry I missed meeting you last fall.  Thanks for calling me in <br/>
the hospital.<br/>
I really do need to meet you, to cleanse myself of a vision, or to confirm it.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my problem:  Having seen it once in the theatre back when, I rented <br/>
&quot;About a Boy&quot; this week and watched it twice:  straight and with the <br/>
directors&#39; commentary.  <br/>
<br/>
I parked the vision of the &quot;daft f***ing hippie&quot; mom on you, and I probably <br/>
need to get it back OFF of you.  August.  I hope you&#39;re at the conference and <br/>
I don&#39;t know whether I hope or not that you&#39;re much like the Fiona character <br/>
played by Toni Collette.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes connections like that just stick.<br/>
<br/>
Too many times to count, when people have met me they look at me like I&#39;m an <br/>
imposter and say &quot;I thought you would be tall.  And blonde.&quot;   I must write <br/>
tall and blonde.  If it had only happened one or two times, I&#39;d think it was <br/>
just that one person saw a movie or something... &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I really like &quot;About a Boy&quot; for lots of reasons.  One is that it&#39;s Brits <br/>
being Brits not for the benefit of an American audience.  They didn&#39;t <br/>
de-slang the script.  They showed news stands and music stores and the <br/>
basement of a church and didn&#39;t stick with only glamor-sites.  That was good <br/>
for my Anglophilia.  AND there&#39;s one character who&#39;s American, but it doesn&#39;t <br/>
matter.  That&#39;s not part of the story and it&#39;s never mentioned, it&#39;s just one <br/>
more of a varied batch of accents which also aren&#39;t brought into the story.  <br/>
The Indian nerd kid is never identified Indian.  The possibly-part-Black <br/>
character (light skin and dreadlocks) isn&#39;t labelled.  Each person is just a <br/>
person.  Fiona&#39;s Scot or northern something I couldn&#39;t swear by.  Doesn&#39;t <br/>
matter that I could tell.<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s my favorite genre of movie, which is circumstances help immature <br/>
young male transform himself into a compassionate man.  I need to make a list <br/>
of those.  At the moment I&#39;m only thinking of &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot; and <br/>
&quot;Guarding Tess.&quot;   But there are others.   &quot;The Matrix&quot; qualifies, though <br/>
that&#39;s not the main theme, I don&#39;t think.  I had to see the Matrix twice, <br/>
though, and ask Marty (14) to tell me what the hell it was about, to start to <br/>
get it all straight.  I had the religious overlay, but that was all I had.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was very moved by the movie &quot;Antwone Fisher&quot; (not sure I spelled that <br/>
right).  I saw his book in the bookstore and was surprised to see it was very <br/>
slim.  (I was taking inventory at the time and couldn&#39;t stop and thumb <br/>
through it.)  <br/>
<br/>
The message I got from it was who you are is who you choose to be, in spite <br/>
of the circumstances of your childhood.  <br/>

back home although he has a few interviews.<br/>
I need to go watch that film again. I didn&#39;t really take it in the first time.<br/>

I&#39;m waiting for it to come to the dollar movie.  They&#39;ve had the poster up <br/>
for a while.  I missed the first run.<br/>
<br/>
Kolya is another of those movies, thought the man isn&#39;t young at the <br/>
beginning of the story.  But he&#39;s a better man at the end.<br/>

north but had lived in London a long time.  It&#39;s as close as I could get.  <br/>

Tomorrow we are getting together with a more local, hopefully more <br/>
relaxed family.  Spent much of my last meeting with other <br/>
homeschoolers reassuring them that children are capable of garning <br/>
information without worksheets.  Anyhow...It will get better I&#39;m <br/>
sure.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh, and Shyrley, we won&#39;t be making HESFES this Spring.  Not enough <br/>
cash after the move.  Hopefully we can do the autumn fest.  So, we <br/>
will miss out on meeting you.<br/>
