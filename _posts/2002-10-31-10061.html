<div id="ygrps-yiv-1032856107"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Glen Schmidt, Dist. Comm. Chair then went on to &gt;say,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;Anybody that&gt;&gt;doesn&#39;t believe in god isn&#39;t a &gt;good<br/>
citizen, and that if an atheist&gt;&gt;found a wallet &gt;on<br/>
the ground they would pick it up plunder the money<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;and throw the wallet back on the ground.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This kind of person really scares me.  He is a<br/>
fundamental Christian who believes in his own self<br/>
righteousness more than in the teachings of his faith.<br/>
 He is a hate monger.  What if he ever has a crisis of<br/>
faith?  What might he be capable of?  He firmly<br/>
believes that the only think keeping human beings from<br/>
committing crimes against each other is the fear of<br/>
Hell and the righteous wrath of the judgemental god<br/>
that he prays to.  <br/>
<br/>
There are two kinds of Chrisitan God, and you can<br/>
usually tell by a person&#39;a action which type they<br/>
believe in.  There is the forgiving all father, the<br/>
loving and peaceful Christ who loves all equally. <br/>
Then there is the fire and brimstone judgement<br/>
bringer, who casts out the unworthy and shuns the<br/>
non-white, oppressing women and heaping sin upon<br/>
humanity.  I say those who embrace that second vision<br/>
of the Christian God are full of guilt and shame<br/>
themselves, and crave punishment.  Wonder what<br/>
skeletons that Scout Director has in his closet....<br/>
