 </span></blockquote>I got my license in Albequerque, NM when I lived there<br/>
for a year.  I spent the first 20 years of my life in<br/>
San Francisco. With the combination of the incredibly<br/>
excellent system of mass transit (trains, BART,<br/>
busses, rail system, ferries, shuttles) that<br/>
crisscrosses the city and links the surrounding<br/>
communities AND the high cost of parking and insurance<br/>
in the city, it was not necessary for me to get a<br/>
license for freedom, nor feasible for me monetarily. <br/>
Plus the city is compact, being only 7 miles square,<br/>
and you can walk to the store, to local restaurants,<br/>
landromat, whatever.  I took busses to school and<br/>
college, to work, to friends houses, parties, events,<br/>
and to the train station or bart to go out of town, or<br/>
shuttles to the airport.<br/>
<br/>
When I moved to New Mexico at 20, I had never been<br/>
behind the wheel of a car, even for any kind of<br/>
drivers ed.  I found myself living in an neighborhood<br/>
on the edge of town, and everything was so much<br/>
farther away from evertyhing else than I was used to. <br/>
I needed a license post haste, just to get back and<br/>
forth to work.  I spent one hour behind the wheel to<br/>
practice, walked into the Licensing place and took my<br/>
test.  I had a behind the wheel test, but was not made<br/>
to drive on the freeway or to parallel park.  I had no<br/>
previous driving experience, no questions were asked<br/>
about that at all.  That first car I drove for sevreal<br/>
years was a huge buick LeSabre boat of a car, with the<br/>
long extended bed. <br/>
<br/>
This was a little over 9 years ago.  I am a very good<br/>
driver, self taught.  I have had one accident, a<br/>
fender bender in heavy stop and go traffic, years<br/>
after I got my license.  I do great in defensive<br/>
situations in fast urban traffic, in strange cities,<br/>
at night, on country roads, have since driven all over<br/>
California, in Portland, Seattle, all over Washington<br/>
State, in icy conditions, rain, sleet, fog, snow, you<br/>
name it.<br/>

when I was heading off to college in San Diego, I decided to get <br/>
one.  I was 18 by that time.  I did get a permit, but it just <br/>
required a written test.  Then my sister taught me to drive, and I <br/>
went back and got a license.  No drivers ed or drivers training <br/>
required.  The permit is needed here to make your practice on the <br/>
road legal, I think.  Well, that was a long time ago, now, so maybe <br/>
things have changed.  :)<br/>
