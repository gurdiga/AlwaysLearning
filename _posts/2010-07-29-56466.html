<div id="ygrps-yiv-17203692">Since there were a few posts that someone mentioned training<br/>
I wanted to bring this up.<br/>
Just today I went to see the two replicas/ship museum of Pinta and Nina.<br/>
Another homeschooling friend joined us there with her 4 kids.<br/>
We have been friends from La Leche since our oldests were around 5 months old<br/>
 Her number 3, a little boy that was born withing days of my 4.5 yeard old Gigi<br/>
lost his quarter playing and started have a little, tiny melt down.<br/>
I offer to give him another but she stopped me saying that she does not want <br/>
that<br/>
kind of behaviour.<br/>
She has , in the past, been very sweet and creativy with her kidsw but the more <br/>
she has and the older they get <br/>
<br/>
things have shifted to a more controlling way and she is almost like training <br/>
them but  very sweetly.<br/>
 Anyways This was posted on a State homeschool list and it really<br/>
amazes me that people want to train children like they are dogs<br/>
<br/>
Here is the person answering a question someone posted about her &quot;offering her <br/>
services&quot; for the group:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Nope. I am not looking for more subjects. I am looking for adults<br/>
interested in learning to use positive reinforcement to teach their<br/>
children. I am looking for people interested in learning to do task<br/>
analysis and teach their children to do things step by step with out<br/>
nagging.<br/>
<br/>
TAGteach is a revolutionary new method of teaching. The focused,<br/>
positive nature of this method yields immediate and stunning results<br/>
that are clearly evident to teachers, students and parents. TAG stands<br/>
for &quot;Teaching with Acoustical Guidance.&quot; The method relies on a<br/>
distinctive sound made to mark or &quot;TAG&quot; a moment in time. This sound<br/>
becomes an acoustical binary message, a sort of &quot;snapshot&quot; that is<br/>
quickly processed by the brain. Regardless of age or application, the<br/>
TAG trained student learns to react accurately with lightning speed<br/>
while building muscle memory and confidence.<br/>
<br/>

Here are some studies to read if you are interested:<br/>

<br/>
Here is some research for using the methods with autistic children:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.tagteach.com/autism/">http://www.tagteach.com/autism/</a><br/>
<br/>
A tag point is a response, action, or position that when accomplished<br/>
wins a reward. The reward for performing a tag point correctly is an<br/>
audible click made by a handheld clicker. The click, or tag, marks the<br/>
exact moment the tag point is executed correctly and gives immediate<br/>
and clear feedback to the student or athlete. TAGteach works on the<br/>
principle of identifying correct behavior and making it stronger while<br/>
ignoring mistakes and allowing them to disappear.<br/>
<br/>
The tag becomes a positive reinforcer through pairing with tangible<br/>
rewards (a sticker for example) or as a result of good feelings of<br/>
success. Younger students trade their tags in for beads, stickers or<br/>
other prizes. Older students and higher level athletes often do not<br/>
require a tangible primary reinforcer, since they are reinforced just<br/>
by receiving the immediate and clear feedback from the tag.<br/>
<br/>
Clarity and simplicity are key aspects of TAGteach. A tag point is<br/>
defined so that the teacher can easily judge whether the tag point is<br/>
achieved and can mark it with a tag. For example, a teacher might say<br/>
to a student who is being taught to draw the letter O, “The tag point<br/>
is placing your pencil tip at the place where the top of the letter<br/>
will be.” Once this has been done correctly several times the teacher<br/>
can move on; “The tag point is movement of the pencil tip to the left<br/>
to start the letter.” If there is any difficulty and the student does<br/>
not succeed after three tries, the teacher will break the skill down<br/>
into smaller parts and go back to a previous point of success. With<br/>
some students it may be necessary to place a dot at the place where<br/>
the letter should start, or to trace letters or to use other prompts<br/>
to help the student succeed at first. These prompts can be gradually<br/>
faded out as the student improves.<br/>
<br/>
There is no scolding or negativity associated with TAGteach. If the<br/>
student hears the tag he knows that the tag point was achieved. If he<br/>
doesn’t hear the tag he knows to try again. There is no “better, but…”<br/>
in TAGteach. If the tag point is “point your toes during the<br/>
handstand” and the student points her toes, but her legs were apart,<br/>
the student receives the tag and the teacher does not say “That was<br/>
better, but next time try to keep your legs together.” Instead, the<br/>
teacher awards the tag for pointed toes and after a few repetitions<br/>
says to the student, “Now the tag point is legs together at the top of<br/>
the handstand.” The student may forget to point her toes while<br/>
thinking about keeping her legs straight. In this case the pointed<br/>
toes tag point can be revisited a few times and eventually the student<br/>
will achieve a toe point with straight legs without ever being told<br/>
that something was wrong. The student learns to self-assess and think<br/>
for herself without relying on corrections from the teacher.<br/>

<br/>
When I was teaching 9th grade a girl requested help to stop an  <br/>
unconscious habit.  I explained conditioning to the kids in the class,  <br/>
and asked them to help her without making a deal about it, without  <br/>
teasing her.  She used to make a tongue noise, like a click or &quot;tsk&quot;  <br/>
just before she spoke, and sometimes when she was thinking.  Other  <br/>
girls, especially, took it as an insult, and sometimes it did come  <br/>
across that way, because if someone asked her for something or to do  <br/>
something she would first &quot;tsk&quot; and then say &quot;okay,&quot; which made it  <br/>
sound like &quot;OH BROTHER, okay, whatever&quot; to people who didn&#39;t know  <br/>
her.  She knew it was harming her reputation and communications.<br/>
<br/>
What we did was whenever she made that sound, others made it too.   <br/>
Didn&#39;t look at her, just clicked quietly.   After a few days the  <br/>
behavior was extinguished.  I think it&#39;s because she did it for  <br/>
herself in her head, like she internalized a group of people doing it  <br/>
right after her, and &quot;trained&quot; us not to do it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-745037600">What a title! &quot;Don&#39;t Shoot the Dog&quot; ???!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s real life Skinnerism at work:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Clicker training was originated through Marian Bailey (neé Kruse) and<br/>
Keller Breland, who as graduate students of psychologist and eminent<br/>
behaviorist B.F. Skinner taught wild-caught pigeons to bowl while<br/>
participating in military research.[1] According to their work, animal<br/>
training was being needlessly hindered because traditional methods of<br/>
praise and reward did not inform the animal of success with enough<br/>
promptness and precision to create the required cognitive connections<br/>
for speedy learning. Similar methods were later used in training at<br/>
least 140 species including whales, bears, lions and domestic dogs and<br/>
cats, and even humans (TAGteach).&quot; from<br/>

That&#39;s something you see in pigeons pretty strongly - they&#39;ll rehearse minutes worth of behavior to receive the &quot;reward&quot; and have to be sort of back-trained to extinct all but the desired respons. Rats are a bit more on-the-ball than pigeons, but will also show superstitious behaviors in response to classical conditioning. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1265568766">I looked at a couple of the TAG video clips yesterday - one of using it to teach skipping, one of using it for training someone to do cartwheels and one using it to help someone learn how to write.  I am surprised and wonder why people wouldn&#39;t say &quot;point your toes&quot; or &quot;straighten your legs&quot; when trying to help someone do a cartwheel or say &quot;down, down, up&quot; when trying to remind someone how to form a certain letter?  Using the clicker (tag training) seems so impersonal and unattached..cold.  I teach ballet and can&#39;t imagine clicking instead of using a kind, encouraging voice with dancers.  I would think it would feel much nicer too to connect with others and speak to them.      Laurie</div>

I agree. What might be a bonus in maintaining objectivity in a scientific<br/>
experiment would be a huge minus in a parent/child or instructor/pupil<br/>
situation.<br/>
<br/>
It might be helpful at times when one wants objectivity though... by choice<br/>
and then stopped when one no longer wants objectivity.<br/>
