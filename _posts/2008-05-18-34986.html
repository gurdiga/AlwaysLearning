<div id="ygrps-yiv-1680960726">The other day, my children and I were at a restaurant, having <br/>
dinner.  As part of the marketing in the decor, there was a humorous <br/>
paragraph written in cursive.  I noticed it and pointed it out to my <br/>
ds(14yo) and dd(11yo).  Both read it and grinned.<br/>
<br/>
It struck me then that I had not taught either of them to read <br/>
cursive.  My ds tends to just &#39;pick things up&#39;, so it was not too <br/>
surprising that he had read it.  But my dd used to have me read <br/>
cursive writing out loud to her, she could not decipher it.  At some <br/>
point (I&#39;m not sure when), she figured it out.  I only noticed this <br/>
week.  <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s never had &quot;lessons&quot; on cursive writing.  There were a few <br/>
weeks, years ago, when she wanted to learn to write in cursive.  <br/>
With my assistance, she pursued the materials to work on it <br/>
independently and when she asked, she and I would write things back-<br/>
and-forth in cursive.  After a short while, she decided that it was <br/>
not an important goal after all.  She can write in cursive, but she <br/>
chooses not too.  I can understand this, I don&#39;t like to write in <br/>
cursive either.  Even when she was pursuing writing in cursive, she <br/>
continued to have difficulty reading much cursive.<br/>
<br/>
So, I thought it was very cool that at some point, while we were <br/>
going about living our lives, she began reading cursive.  <br/>
<br/>
A similar thing happened with fractions.  Many years ago, when I <br/>
still thought that I needed to *teach* math, I tried to give her <br/>
*lessons* on fractions.  It was incredibly frustrating for both of <br/>
us until I decided to let go of my math anxiety and let it be.  <br/>
<br/>
Then one day, in some activity or conversation, she was discussing <br/>
fractions as an accurate and natural part of whatever we were <br/>
involved in.  It may have happened prior to that occasion, but I <br/>
noticed it at that time and realized that she understood fractions <br/>
as part of her daily life, with no adult-imposed expectations or <br/>
restrictions.<br/>
<br/>
When worrying about &quot;how will they learn if...&quot;, so much unnecessary <br/>
stress becomes part of life.  It has been very fun for me to live <br/>
and enjoy life with my children and discover and relish the things <br/>
that come.  My dh and I often marvel at what our children *know*, <br/>
not just academically recognized things (though those are the things <br/>
that tend to be worrying points.)<br/>
<br/>
This seemed to be a good place to share this.  The older my children <br/>
get, the more reassured I am about having made this decision to <br/>
unschool.<br/>

<br/>
DS (6) is already trying to figure out how to read cursive.  I&#39;ve never<br/>
pointed it out to him, and certainly never named it.  He is just a curious<br/>
little bugger, and hates it when he doesn&#39;t know something.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny, though.  I remember when I was little, my dad and I used to play<br/>
an ABC game in the car on long road trips.  We had to start with A and find<br/>
each letter in order on signs, etc.  Whoever got to Z first, won.  Up until<br/>
3rd grade (when I finally learned cursive) I remember always telling him our<br/>
rule, &quot;No cursive letters!&quot; because I thought it was unfair if he could read<br/>
cursive, and I couldn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I was waiting to learn cursive!  How silly.  It never occurred to me, until<br/>
now, that I could have asked to learn to read cursive before it was taught<br/>
in school!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m so glad that you wrote this. 11yr old DS used to ask me to read <br/>
him cursive and he did eventually pick it up although he does not <br/>
write it. In fact he never wrote anything(unless I really pushed and <br/>
demanded,which I used to) until this year a few months ago. We never <br/>
did grammar studies or punctuation. I was so incredibly worried and <br/>
frustrated because writing even one sentence seemed to be beyond him. <br/>
He always wanted to dictate to me and have me write for him, which I <br/>
did after much hemming and hawing and arguing.<br/>
<br/>
This year after I decided to just let it go he started to type. He <br/>
does not do just simple sentences,long elaborate paragraphs! His <br/>
spelling is perfect,grammar  and punctuation are all great! He writes <br/>
little notes around the house with very neat handwriting. All with no <br/>
practice. he was always a really good reader, so maybe just seeing <br/>
how the written words look was enough for him to get it.  <br/>
I look back and see how I did not trust in him and how much stress it <br/>
caused us to argue over writing.<br/>

school at home, how math kept comming up that I didn&#39;t remember or <br/>
was never able to grasp from school. I stress even now that it will <br/>
be limiting to him to not be exposed to these things in a lesson <br/>
presentation. Reading what you wrote helped me remember how it worked <br/>
out with writing and that math really is not a whole differnt world. <br/>
