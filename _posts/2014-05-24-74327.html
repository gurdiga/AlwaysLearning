<div id="ygrps-yiv-1440494348">Learn Nothing Day is two months away.  I have art and humor to distribute, some good things from past years to revisit, and a blog to keep it on.<br/>
<br/>
What I have learned, though, is that the videos don&#39;t show on some phones, or iPads.  So tomorrow, please go here to see a video:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://learnnothingday.blogspot.com">http://learnnothingday.blogspot.com</a><br/>
<br/>
And if you subscribe to the blog and look on a device that won&#39;t show videos, please try from a computer.  <br/>
<br/>
Most entries are photos and that won&#39;t be a problem.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also putting older Learn Nothing Day links and art, from years&#39; past, so it can be easily found and browsed.<br/>
<br/>
If any of what you see there inspires you to create some art or write a testimonial or design a good plan for learning nothing, let me know!  <br/>
<br/>
There are two videos already, though, and another coming tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
