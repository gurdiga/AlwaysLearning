Okay, I was just a kid when all this happened, but this is what<br/>
I heard from my Mom who is pretty good at researching stuff.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If that were the case, why wouldn&#39;t we have heard of other companies having <br/>
&gt; to change and then come back?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It was a 99 year patent,,,that&#39;s all I know.  Maybe most of us <br/>
haven&#39;t been alive for 99 years?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If it&#39;s true, it would have been cheaper for them to just shut down a little <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; while than to make new packaging and all that.  And if that were the case, <br/>
&gt; they could have advertised it and let people stock up, but it was a total <br/>
&gt; overnight surprise mess.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Shutting down would have meant HUGE losses in sales.  It was<br/>
cheaper to make a new product while waiting to renew the patent.<br/>
(again, according to my Mom&#39;s research)<br/>
<br/>
They couldn&#39;t advertise they were in the process of renewing <br/>
their patent.  It had to be hush hush so some other company <br/>
wouldn&#39;t apply for the same patent at the same time (there was<br/>
a short period when the patent was expired and the new patent<br/>
hadn&#39;t been granted yet),,,,who knows who&#39;s paperwork would <br/>
have gone through first if that happened?<br/>
<br/>
Again, this is all according to what my Mom found out about<br/>
it.  She could be totally wrong for all I know.<br/>
<br/>
BTW,,,I took the Pepsi challenge several times and *always*<br/>
chose Coke.  Pepsi tasted way too sweet for me.<br/>
