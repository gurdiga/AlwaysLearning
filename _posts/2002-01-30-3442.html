<div id="ygrps-yiv-2095237451">There are another couple of myths gaining weight these days (past few years), <br/>
both of which really, truly bother me.   One was triggered by this:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; It still amazes me to see homeschoolers who are so out of touch with kids<br/>
in general and their own kids. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On homeschooling discussion groups and &quot;SUPPORT groups&quot; (heavy on supporting <br/>
whatever, and not really helping people change for the better or learn more) <br/>
it is standard fare for people to be told &quot;you&#39;re the expert!&quot; &quot;No expert <br/>
knows your children better than you do!&quot;  etc.<br/>
<br/>
There are people who do not know their children.  They don&#39;t know who their <br/>
friends are, what they like, what they know, what they think is wonderful or <br/>
whatever.  <br/>
<br/>
Some of them are homeschoolers.   <br/>
<br/>
There are people who don&#39;t have a clue about when a child might be expected <br/>
to know how to tie shoes, or to remember something he promised the day <br/>
before, or how many things a person can memorize at one sitting.<br/>
<br/>
And some of them are homeschoolers who say they are the experts on their <br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
I just cringe when I hear that.<br/>
<br/>
And then there are people who will pass straight on to their children as fact <br/>
things that are not fact.  There was an &quot;unborn chicken&quot; incident on <br/>
unschooling.com a while back.  I don&#39;t think the mom came back after we asked <br/>
a couple of questions and someone explained the realities of chicken-eggs to <br/>
her.<br/>
<br/>
She wanted to be right more than she wanted to learn.  She wanted to be her <br/>
son&#39;s only teacher, and she wanted what she said to be true just because she <br/>
said it.  Because she was *HOMESCHOOLING.*<br/>
<br/>
I fear other people&#39;s power plays.<br/>
<br/>
And the other irritating assertion is &quot;All truths are equally valid.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps, in the case of religious beliefs or cultural traditions or <br/>
languages, yes.  Maybe anthropologically speaking cremation is as valid as <br/>
burial or exposure or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s often used to try to legitimate nonsense, or to justify a really bad <br/>
piece of reasoning.   <br/>
<br/>
And I said the last time we wrestled that one (not here, elsewhere) and I&#39;ll <br/>
say it again--just because there&#39;s no one single truth doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s <br/>
no such thing as bullshit.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I know this is true. It is my lack of imagination that does me in here.<br/>
Homeschooling is an immersion my kids. It&#39;s hard for me to imagine that it<br/>
isn&#39;t the same for others, that folks don&#39;t have a burning desire to learn<br/>
about ages and stages.<br/>
<br/>
I think of the &quot;expert on your children&quot; thing as an LLL concept that has<br/>
been twisted. Take a nice slogan, forget the truth behind it, and use it to<br/>
mean whatever you want.<br/>
