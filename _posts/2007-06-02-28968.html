How to play &quot;A Case of You&quot; by Joni Mitchell<br/>
<br/>
What makes this an amazing coincidence is I listened to a bunch of  <br/>
Joni Mitchell yesterday, including a recording Prince did of A Case  <br/>
of You (which can be bought for 99 cents from iTunes and is pretty  <br/>
wonderful).  (Marty has been on a big Prince jag lately, but I  <br/>
haven&#39;t shared that one with him because I don&#39;t think he knows the  <br/>
Joni Mitchell version, and we&#39;ve been really busy.)<br/>
<br/>
This is the second amazing-coincidence accidental song find of the  <br/>
day.  It&#39;s not like I was looking through a bunch of YouTube stuff.   <br/>
I was looking for a specific thing unrelated to either of them and  <br/>
found them both.<br/>
<br/>
The other was a version of &quot;Take a Whiff,&quot; an old cocaine song I have  <br/>
on a Cisco Houston album (33 rpm antique), which Holly and I wrote  <br/>
verses for for a friend of ours who said once &quot;Smell me--take a  <br/>
whiff&quot; because he had put cologne on.  Longer funnier story, but  <br/>
anyway... today I found something called &quot;Take a Drink on Me&quot; with  <br/>
photos of pubs in Wales (and other mostly worthless stuff, and exotic  <br/>
urinals at the end) and it was that very same song, which we first  <br/>
sang for our friend last weekend.<br/>
<br/>
WEIRD.<br/>
<br/>
OH!  And about &quot;A Case of You,&quot; I&#39;m very glad the guy made this.   <br/>
It&#39;s very much like Blackbird, by Paul McCartney, which is also  <br/>
played almost exclusively on the G and B strings!  Guitarists will  <br/>
appreciate this, and others might not mind it much.<br/>
