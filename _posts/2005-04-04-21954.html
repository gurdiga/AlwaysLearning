I want  him to come home so that he can continue<br/>
to learn, but it was his idea to  try out public school and I thought I would<br/>
make him do one year.   <br/>

<br/>
=======================<br/>
 <br/>
Learning doesn&#39;t just happen at home any more than it just happens at  <br/>
school.  He learns halfway to school.  He learns while he&#39;s physically  at school <br/>
but his mind is elsewhere.  <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Why would you MAKE him do a year of school if you didn&#39;t even want him to  go?<br/>

Certificate of Empowerment, much about learning and not finishing things  <br/>
that aren&#39;t worth finishing.<br/>

-=-I did want him to put in ONE year of public school, since it was his  idea <br/>
to<br/>
try it out.  I didn&#39;t want him to go back and forth in his  mind.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Isn&#39;t that what learning&#39;s all about?<br/>
Aren&#39;t you going back and forth in your mind?<br/>
