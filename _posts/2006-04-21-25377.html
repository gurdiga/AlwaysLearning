<div id="ygrps-yiv-505150321">I completely agree! And I have been in the unfortunate position of following<br/>
through with my own mother. She refused to respect our choices. We were not<br/>
looking for approval, but demanded and expected respect. The same respect we<br/>
were willing to give to her choices. It was actually her partner that was<br/>
causing all the ruckus (I have never met a more condescending, rude,<br/>
disrespectful person in my life), but she had to make choices. We had about<br/>
2 years of not seeing her and very limited contact via phone. It was not<br/>
easy, but it was necessary and good. We actually have a very good<br/>
relationship with her now. She moved out on her own. She now respects our<br/>
choices and even agrees with some of what we do...what she doesn&#39;t agree<br/>
with she keeps to herself when the kids are around. We have a pretty good<br/>
time now when we get together.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot imagine allowing anyone to say such horrible things to me or my<br/>
children. No one has that right, absolutely no one.<br/>

<br/>
So you&#39;re saying that, if you put your foot down, she would refuse to pay for her <br/>
granddaughter to receive this MOST important step to becoming a person?<br/>
<br/>
I doubt it. She might threaten, but I bet she&#39;d keep doing it---especially of Heather is doing <br/>
well. At least she gets to brag about *one* grand-child.<br/>
<br/>
Either way, I wouldn&#39;t put up with that for ONE second.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1266389167">I know it can be difficult to deal with family members.  I will say for me that when it comes to my children I am extremely protective, as is my husband.  His mother is not allowed to be alone with the children.  She is mean, spiteful, selfish, and many other things.  The last time we saw her was November.  We keep it that way with lots of space in between.  My daughter feels bad for her because she&#39;s so mean.  It&#39;s a sad thing when a seven yr old has pity on their grandparent.<br/>
