 </span></blockquote>THAT is the crux of it, imo. So - the parents&#39; &quot;job&quot; or &quot;joy&quot; is to really <br/>
get themselves &quot;in tune&quot; with the kids - be aware of what interests them <br/>
because that really IS what they need. Believing that the kids will make it <br/>
clear what they need - that we can trust them to do that - I think that is <br/>
really what unschooling is about. BUT - it doesn&#39;t mean just leave them alone <br/>
and wait for them to come to us and say, &quot;It occurs to me, mom and/or dad, <br/>
that I&#39;m interested in studying trigonometry.&quot; It means noticing that they <br/>
love movies or skateboarding or videogames or hours of reading or <br/>
eavesdropping on adult discussions or digging in the mud or that they <br/>
remember the names and characteristics of songs, plants, animals, foods, <br/>
famous people, certain time periods, clothing styles, war battles, airplanes, <br/>
or that they SEE a lot - that they notice things with their eyes, that they <br/>
notice colors or shapes or patterns. Every kid is completely different mix - <br/>
unique. So every parent has to observe their own kid and figure out what they <br/>
can do to support that particular child.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling means parents support what they notice in their kids, NOT try to <br/>
limit it - or get around it to make them more well-rounded and not say things <br/>
like, &quot;He doesn&#39;t seem to want to read nonfiction much, so I got him these <br/>
books about motorcycles to try to get him to read more of it.&quot; In other <br/>
words, I&#39;m not talking about &quot;using&quot; their interests to manipulate them into <br/>
doing what we want them to do. I&#39;m talking about REALLY supporting their <br/>
interests. If a kid is interested in motorcycles, if reading books isn&#39;t his <br/>
way of learning, then don&#39;t get him books and make him try to learn about <br/>
motorcycles that way as a backdoor to getting him to read more. On the other <br/>
hand, get him books and magazines as a way of supporting him learning more <br/>
about motorcycles and then be happy if he looks only at the pictures or asks <br/>
you to read to him or whatever.  <br/>
