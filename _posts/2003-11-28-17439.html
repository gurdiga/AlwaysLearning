<div id="ygrps-yiv-935085535">I am so glad someone else notices this stuff, too!  My kitties are just as<br/>
affectionate as my dogs- I think because I raised them as if they are<br/>
capable of just as much love as a dog.  Very similar to parenting issues.<br/>

&gt; *I** just realized that while children are dogs --<br/>
&gt; loyal and<br/>
&gt; affectionate-- teenagers are cats. It&#39;s so easy to be<br/>
&gt; a dog owner.  You<br/>
&gt; feed it, train it, boss it around. It puts its head on<br/>
&gt; your knee and<br/>
&gt; gazes at you as if you were a Rembrandt painting.  It<br/>
&gt; bounds indoors<br/>
&gt; with enthusiasm when you call it.*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; *Then, around age 13, your adoring little puppy turns<br/>
&gt; into a big old<br/>
&gt; cat.<br/>
&gt; Oh, it&#39;s terribly obnoxious, but I think they MEAN well. (Which is always<br/>
one<br/>
&gt; of the worst things you can say about somebody. You know they&#39;re $%#@$% up<br/>
&gt; somewhere.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The point, at least, seems to be to try to understand a developmental<br/>
change,<br/>
&gt; and that it&#39;s normal. The analogy is not wonderful...but it all could be<br/>
&gt; worse. And as insulting as it is to teenagers, I think this person has<br/>
some bias<br/>
&gt; against cats they should really look at.<br/>
