<div id="ygrps-yiv-1940550137">Always Learning Live events have been held now in New Mexico and Massachusetts.   Next weekend (starting this Thursday) a couple of dozen families are meeting in Minneapolis at a water park:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://allunschoolingminnesota2013.blogspot.com">http://allunschoolingminnesota2013.blogspot.com</a><br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s too late to get discount rooms, but the rooms aren&#39;t very much anyway and they come with four waterpark passes.   Speakers are Jill Parmer, Alex Polikowsky and me, and there will be guided discussions based on a model I used for years in philosophy discussions within the SCA.  I haven&#39;t done these at conferences before, but Rippy Dusseldorp and I talked about it last summer, and I&#39;ve been thinking about it.  <br/>
<br/>
This summer, Joyce Fetteroll and I will speak in four places.  Three are Always Learning events, and one is the LiTTLe Conference, run by Julie Daniel near London.  Lisbon, London, Leiden (and Selkirk) is what I&#39;ve been calling the little circuit, although the order is this:<br/>
Lisbon, Portugal June 1-2, 2013<br/>
Selkirk (Scotland) UK  June  24 (a Monday)<br/>
Leiden, the Netherlands, June 29<br/>
Ashford, Surrey, UK  July 13-14<br/>

<br/>
In December I&#39;ll do another event here in Albuquerque between Christmas and New Year&#39;s but I don&#39;t have a site up for it yet.<br/>
<br/>
In 2014 there is a possibility and some definites:<br/>
<br/>
Joyce and Sandra to Australia in March and early April for five gatherings, the last one of which will include Schuyler Waynforth and her husband, David.<br/>

<br/>
Maybe California (still talking)<br/>
<br/>
Late September, Maine and New Hampshire (still being sorted out, but a definite plan):<br/>

<br/>
Those interested in Minneapolis should do something soon. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Those interested in the others can put it on the calendar and start saving money!  :-)<br/>
