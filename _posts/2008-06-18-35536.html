<div id="ygrps-yiv-320337918">Today we were all at a friend&#39;s house for a couple<br/>
hours. My two daughters are seven and five, and their<br/>
friend is six.<br/>
<br/>
When it was time for us to leave, the friend&#39;s family<br/>
was getting ready to go run some errands, and her mom<br/>
asked her to tidy up her room a little (where all the<br/>
girls had been playing earlier.)<br/>
<br/>
The friend asked my daughters if they would help her<br/>
tidy up. My seven year old said yes and went in the<br/>
room with her. My five year old simply said no and<br/>
continued playing.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t interfere.<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m wondering ... should I have done anything?<br/>
<br/>
For example, tell her that she should help also, as<br/>
they were also using the stuff together? <br/>
<br/>
Should I have maybe said to her, &quot;Here, let&#39;s you and<br/>
I go help them together?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Should I have told her it&#39;s not nice to go to someone<br/>
else&#39;s house and use their stuff, but then not help<br/>
put it away?<br/>
<br/>
Or was it not a big deal that she didn&#39;t help?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<br/>
  I would have offered to do it together and if they really didn&#39;t want to I would help pick up. Most times I just pick up things that my child takes out at someone&#39;s house without saying anything. It depends on where we are also, different friends have different rules and expectations.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-877925506">I ask my five year old what part she wants to put away, because asking<br/>
her that seems to help her see it as manageable.  If she doesn&#39;t want<br/>
to help I usually don&#39;t press the issue (though I used to before<br/>
reading unschooling lists).<br/>
<br/>
I clean up in her place.  I try to remember to ask the other mom what<br/>
she would most like help with, nearish the end, but before the end of<br/>
the visit.  Yesterday the other mom was desperately glad that I picked<br/>
up about 40 pieces of play food.  She was SO grateful.  I know the<br/>
feeling.  :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I would never *expect* an adult friend to help clean up before they <br/>
left ... I don&#39;t make my DH&#39;s bluegrass buddies do the dishes they made <br/>
before they leave after a pick, if I had a grown-ups&#39; game night I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t make everyone put the games back where they belonged.   <br/>
<br/>
Also, at that young of an age, 5 and 7, transitions and goodbyes are <br/>
hard enough without adding the stress of cleanup -- in my mind doing <br/>
nothing would never lead me to &quot;not invite them back&quot;.    <br/>
<br/>
I am pretty insistent that my kids&#39; friends (and their parents) do NOT <br/>
have to help with clean up at our house.  If a parent insists and just <br/>
starts, I let them do what they want and usually jump in to help with <br/>
the organizing, but if they want their own child to do cleanup I <br/>
usually ask them to leave it -- the kids and I, or just I, can always <br/>
do it later when they aren&#39;t trying to squeeze the last moments of <br/>
playtime out of a playdate.<br/>
<br/>
I also, in general, don&#39;t pick up before friends come to play, that way <br/>
I can just let the parents know that it looked that way when the kids <br/>
arrived.  They usually relax about it then.  I have noticed that many <br/>
of our close friends have begun to use a similar tactic ... less and <br/>
less often does it seem like *cleanup* is a necessary part saying <br/>
goodbye to a friend.  <br/>
<br/>
If they aren&#39;t specifically asked, I will ask my children if there is <br/>
anything they could/would like to help put away, but it is really an <br/>
honest question, not a disguised command.  And I will ask the <br/>
host/hostess if there is anything I can do.  I just think it is polite <br/>
to at least offer.<br/>
<br/>
If I am at someone else&#39;s house and my children _are_ asked to help <br/>
with the cleanup, I encourage them to help out but I leave it up to <br/>
them how they participate, AND I always jump in and work with them or <br/>
whoever is doing the cleanup.  If it seems like the host/hostess feels <br/>
like one of my kids isn&#39;t *doing their part* I may just pick something <br/>
up and hand it to the child in question, saying &quot;Do you know where this <br/>
goes?  Can you put it back?&quot;  Or &quot;Can you find out where this goes?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
One time my DD asked if she could have her friend help clean up before <br/>
she left, I told her it was up to her and her friend how they wanted to <br/>
leave things ... They must have worked something out, I heard them <br/>
discussing it and then her room looked a little cleaner than it had <br/>
about an hour earlier.  <br/>
<br/>
For me, personally, I just really hated it when parents would say to <br/>
their children, &quot;Well if you don&#39;t help clean up we won&#39;t be able to <br/>
come back and play again!&quot;  So, I took some preventative measures ... <br/>
no kid will ever have to hear that in my house.<br/>
<br/>
Long-winded ... sorry.<br/>

 for most children sometimes big messes (actually any mess) can be<br/>
overwhelming, if I am there with them it seems so much easier, as<br/>
usually we have a good time ( aiming at the boxes to toss stuff in etc.)<br/>

<br/>
OH!  Excellent point.  I withdraw all my other commentary.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Also, at that young of an age, 5 and 7, transitions and goodbyes  <br/>
are  hard enough without adding the stress of cleanup -- in my mind  <br/>
doing nothing would never lead me to &quot;not invite them back&quot;. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I worried more about wanting them to come back when my kids were  <br/>
little.  Having other kids to play with is hugely valuable.<br/>
<br/>
Other moms  used to tell their kids to clean up, and I&#39;d usually say  <br/>
&quot;No, that&#39;s fine--my kids aren&#39;t through playing with that stuff,&quot; or  <br/>
&quot;No, it&#39;s okay, let them run around the yard until it&#39;s time to go&quot;  <br/>
or something.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes if all the kids just DID it (picking up all the toy dishes  <br/>
or whatever) I would thank them like they had done the coolest thing  <br/>
ever, but I never told or asked them (or my kids) to pick it all up.   <br/>
It can seem like a punishment, or like you never wanted them to get  <br/>
that stuff out in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
This is a really good approach, and it helps kids learn how to help:<br/>
<br/>
-=-If it seems like the host/hostess feels like one of my kids isn&#39;t  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2066058962">Back to the original question:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-I didn&#39;t interfere.-=-<br/>
<br/>
How would it be &quot;interfering&quot; to advise your own child?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-But I&#39;m wondering ... should I have done anything?<br/>
<br/>
For example, tell her that she should help also, as<br/>
they were also using the stuff together?<br/>

Should I have told her it&#39;s not nice to go to someone<br/>

<br/>
Or was it not a big deal that she didn&#39;t help?-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I could say it wasn&#39;t a big deal, but that doesn&#39;t mean you shouldn&#39;t  <br/>
talk to her about it.  At least, the next time she&#39;s gong to be at  <br/>
that house coach her in advance that they have a policy of picking  <br/>
things up and she should volunteer to help without needing to be asked.<br/>
<br/>
I would definitely talk to her about different people&#39;s houses having  <br/>
expectations (some you take your shoes off; some you talk quietly  <br/>
inside; some you don&#39;t play on the bed; some, no drinks on carpetted  <br/>
areas, etc.)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; left ... <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have had people that make such a mess that I don&#39;t invite them <br/>
back.  It is not worth it to me to watch their very defiant child <br/>
for them when they are visiting and clean up the huge mess and <br/>
replace broken toys.  If we want to visit with this particular <br/>
family we go to their house or the park.  Usually when they came to <br/>
our house it was to watch football with DH and they did not pay any <br/>
attention to the children.<br/>
<br/>
If an adult friend came over to play a game or something they have <br/>
always offered to clean up and there is only one game out.  If we <br/>
are going to play a different game the first one gets picked up <br/>
first.  That is the difference with adults and kids.  The adults <br/>
usually only get out one game at a time and the kids get tons of <br/>
stuff out and make a huge mess.<br/>
<br/>
If kids came to play with my kids in their rooms I remind my kids <br/>
beforhand that they can either clean up the mess by themselves or <br/>
ask the friend and let the friend know the rules they have for their <br/>
room.  This has always worked well.  Only once has another kid not <br/>
respected them and I my son was upset and I asked the kid to either <br/>
be respectful of my sons stuff or stay in the playroom with the <br/>
other kids (it was during a party)  He apologized to my son and it <br/>
hasn&#39;t happened again.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is good to talk to kids about being helpful and <br/>
respectful of other peoples things and houses.  When my kids were <br/>
younger I would tell them before we went somewhere that it would be <br/>
nice of us to clean up any messes we make and try to follow rules <br/>
that other people have at their homes. Then they knew what to expect <br/>
and they never had a problem with it.  Now they just offer to clean <br/>
up on their own.  They are 9 and 11, I haven&#39;t asked them to clean <br/>
anything up for at least 4 years, they just do it when they know <br/>
it&#39;s almost time to go.<br/>

With my kids, too, they always knew that the expectations concerning  <br/>
their behavior depends where we&#39;re going.  Some stores are rowdier  <br/>
than others; some are quiet.  Some restaurants are still and dark,  <br/>
and others have ball-crawls.  People act differently at and after  <br/>
funerals than at and after weddings.   Different houses have  <br/>
different rules.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I worry that there are unschooling parents telling their  <br/>
kids (or thinking it without even overtly expressing it) that they  <br/>
can act however they want wherever they are.<br/>

would go through the toys dumping everything out, including pulling <br/>
all the books off the shelf.  And it was almost as if he was clumsy <br/>
or didn&#39;t know his own strength, toys would just suffer under his <br/>
grip, he didn&#39;t _want_ to break toys.  After the first couple of <br/>
times I just came up a plan: reduce the amount of stuff he had access <br/>
to.  Basically I would take almost every toy bin, and especially the <br/>
ones that were a real pain to seperate from other stuff (like <br/>
playmobil and puzzles) and put them in the guest bedroom and lock the <br/>
door.  They weren&#39;t *off limits*, my kids knew where they were and I <br/>
could always get something out ... but for this particular child it <br/>
reduced everyone&#39;s stress.  He could play the way he wanted to, and <br/>
neither I nor his mother had to feel so much upset at the clean up <br/>
process.  It worked so well that I began to do it when we had large <br/>
toddler parties ... ten 4 year olds can get out a lot of toys, AND <br/>
they are usually perfectly happy with whatever is provided.<br/>
<br/>
If my own child were like this, and I am pretty sure that as a parent <br/>
you would know if this was how your child was, I think calling ahead <br/>
and making a request or at least giving a heads-up would be extremely <br/>
courteous.  But, in my experience, he was the only child of the many, <br/>
many kids that have been to our house to play, who seemed to play <br/>
that way.  <br/>
<br/>
In the case of the one child whose parents don&#39;t seem to take <br/>
responsibility for his actions at your home, I think the park is a <br/>
great solution!  But if you have to be at your home, maybe you can <br/>
limit the stuff he has access to as well.<br/>
 <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I totally agree with this ... I think preparing your kids for what <br/>
may happen is key as well as reminding them about helpfulness and <br/>
respectfulness.  But I am always open to the fact that when the time <br/>
comes to leave they may be upset enough that clean up is going to be <br/>
up to me.  Of course my oldest (8) is still younger than your <br/>
youngest, so as time progresses so too will the way goodbyes and <br/>
transitions occur.<br/>

<br/>
We had a couple years ago who did the pulling everything off the  <br/>
shelves thing.  My guess then (and I still figure, now) was that he  <br/>
couldn&#39;t reach anything at his house.  If kids never get to touch  <br/>
stuff, how will they know how it works?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe your friend broke toys because at home he hadn&#39;t had many, or  <br/>
his parents weren&#39;t paying much attention to him when he played, to  <br/>
help him learn how to be.<br/>
<br/>
My kids still have toys they had when they were babies.<br/>

  *****Very good point! I don&#39;t ask others to clean up my house before they leave either. The question was about being at someone else&#39;s house. In my case it depends on who it is as to whether we *need* to pick up or not.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1353325297">-=-When my kids were<br/>
  younger I would tell them before we went somewhere that it would be<br/>

<br/>
  With my kids, too, they always knew that the expectations concerning  <br/>
  their behavior depends where we&#39;re going.  Some stores are rowdier  <br/>
  than others; some are quiet.  Some restaurants are still and dark,  <br/>
  and others have ball-crawls.  People act differently at and after  <br/>
  funerals than at and after weddings.   Different houses have  <br/>
  different rules.<br/>
<br/>
  ***************I have always done this too, we can&#39;t expect them to know what it&#39;s like everywhere. We don&#39;t go places that they can&#39;t handle either. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1191638958"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; The adults<br/>
&gt; usually only get out one game at a time and the kids get tons of<br/>
&gt; stuff out and make a huge mess.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I had to do a lot of rethinking about &quot;messes&quot;.  When there are toys and<br/>
things scattered about the house, it&#39;s easy for my ordered brain to say<br/>
&quot;MESS, I must pick up.&quot; , but it isn&#39;t the way my kids see the way they<br/>
have their things in the house.  They don&#39;t see MESS, they see stuff<br/>
that is easy to access now that it&#39;s been dumped out of it&#39;s box and<br/>
onto the floor along with the toy cars, the barbies, the wooden blocks,<br/>
and the monopoly money.  There is something they are DOing with all the<br/>
stuff.<br/>
<br/>
AND, it doesn&#39;t change when they get older, my oldest (14) has the<br/>
bathroom completely set up in such a way that all of her things are out<br/>
and easy to access.  Sometimes I go in there to throw it all in her<br/>
basket if we have company coming over, but mostly I try very hard to<br/>
pretend that it&#39;s not there so that I don&#39;t feel a compulsion to mess<br/>
with it!  (no pun intended...)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If kids came to play with my kids in their rooms I remind my kids<br/>
&gt; beforhand that they can either clean up the mess by themselves or<br/>
&gt; ask the friend and let the friend know the rules they have for their<br/>
&gt; room.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But why must it always end with tidy?  Rooms have doors that can be<br/>
closed if a mom doesn&#39;t want to see a room that has no view of the<br/>
floor.  When my oldest daughter was little, I did what you are<br/>
suggesting, I had her and her guests clean up stuff.  I didn&#39;t think it<br/>
was a big deal, but guess what my daughter&#39;s least favorite memory is<br/>
from that time?  Yep, me, making her and her guests clean up.  So,<br/>
somewhere along the way I stopped doing that, but the memory will always<br/>
be there, even though I&#39;ve apologized for doing that, and she helps me<br/>
to remember not to do it to her little sister!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think it is good to talk to kids about being helpful and<br/>
&gt; respectful of other peoples things and houses. When my kids were<br/>
&gt; younger I would tell them before we went somewhere that it would be<br/>
&gt; nice of us to clean up any messes we make and try to follow rules<br/>
&gt; that other people have at their homes.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We always ask our host if they&#39;d like us to help pick up.  Most of the<br/>
time people say &quot;no&quot; and sometimes they say &quot;oh yes, please, and<br/>
thanks&quot;.  If our host was asking her own children to pick up with their<br/>
guests already there, which is kind of tacky, we&#39;d offer to help and if<br/>
one of my kids didn&#39;t want to, I&#39;d do it for them.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2130223777"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt; We had a friend who was, what I jokingly called, a *dumper*. He<br/>
&gt; would go through the toys dumping everything out, including pulling<br/>
&gt; all the books off the shelf. And it was almost as if he was clumsy<br/>
&gt; or didn&#39;t know his own strength, toys would just suffer under his<br/>
&gt; grip, he didn&#39;t _want_ to break toys.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s fascinating to me how different kids play with toys.  My older<br/>
daughter had a very organized system that I set up for her toys.  It<br/>
worked for her, she always knew where things were and she wasn&#39;t likely<br/>
to mix and match toys so much.  My youngest daughter is more of a free<br/>
for all kind of player, where most certainly the legos work best with<br/>
the baby dolls and tiny animal figures (but of course they do?!).  The<br/>
organizational toy system of seperating things out only kind of works<br/>
for her.  She&#39;s more the REALLY big toy box throw everything in it, kind<br/>
of kid.  That&#39;s been hard for me to get past.  I like to know that<br/>
little janie baby doll has both of her shoes the next time you want to<br/>
play with her, but my daughter really doesn&#39;t care, so I work hard to<br/>
let it go.<br/>
<br/>
She doesn&#39;t intentionally break toys either, but she sometimes plays<br/>
with them so intensely that they break.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1101329604">Last winter we had a get-together here every Wednesday with eight to  <br/>
a dozen SCA people, to talk history or philosophy or literature-- <br/>
various topics.  I would make food.  Sometimes one of them would  <br/>
start taking all the plates into the other room and putting the food  <br/>
away.  I appreciated it as a gesture, and sometimes when they left  <br/>
the place was nearly clean.  Sometimes I would rather they&#39;d sit and  <br/>
talk because they were distracting me or I was afraid one of them  <br/>
would miss something.  But they&#39;re young and energetic (20&#39;s, early  <br/>
30&#39;s most of them) and I understand finding an excuse to get up and  <br/>
move.<br/>
<br/>
That came to mind as I was thinking about adults offering to help.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I totally agree and I&#39;m sure my oldest would say the same thing about<br/>
memories of having to clean up!  <br/>
<br/>
 I want my kids to feel free to explore and create and not be stunted<br/>
by the little (or big ) thought in the back of their head that when it<br/>
is through that they will have to clean up and so they just decide<br/>
they don&#39;t want to do *whatever* because it will be too much work<br/>
because of clean up.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m at someone else&#39;s house I offer to clean up and ask my kids if<br/>
they&#39;d like to help.  Sometimes they do and when they don&#39;t I will<br/>
just do it-as a courtesy to the family, b/c they often do the same at<br/>
our house(I don&#39;t ask they just start and often I ask them to leave<br/>
it-I&#39;d rather do it when they leave so we can all just enjoy the time<br/>
together).  Remembering, too that some families like to have all of<br/>
their stuff out and don&#39;t want it picked up&lt;g&gt;.  Those are some of the<br/>
best houses to play in!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Exactly. <br/>
<br/>
Along the same line but, of a slightly different thread I really<br/>
prefer that when people, kids, whomever visit they not clean up. I<br/>
want everyone to enjoy the limited time we have together and don&#39;t<br/>
want anyone to spend time cleaning up when they could be sitting and<br/>
relaxing(knowing that some people need the space from socializing and<br/>
doing something solitary like cleaning up in the middle of a party<br/>
will re-energize them-that&#39;s something different). <br/>
<br/>
 I invite people over to have a good time, not to clean up, no matter<br/>
what the mess.  Before I invite I calculate the amount of mess in and<br/>
just deal with it when it&#39;s over.  Life is short.  Who is going to say<br/>
&quot;I wish I&#39;d cleaned more&quot; at the end of it(I think that is an Erma<br/>
Bombeck quote).  Or &quot;I wish I&#39;d made my kids clean more&quot;.<br/>
