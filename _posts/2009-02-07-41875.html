 -=-***Hmm. So what do you recommend? Perhaps child-led learning or<br/>
interest-led learning? Does that sound more appropriate?-=-<br/>
 <br/>
How about &quot;kind of unschooled&quot; or &quot;sometimes unschooled&quot;?  Your  <br/>
website isn&#39;t about unschooling.  What I saw said you used a  <br/>
combination of traditional stuff and unschooling.  (It&#39;s not a <br/>
quote,  <br/>
and I&#39;m  not going back to get a quote.)<br/>

***Well heck, we&#39;re back to where we started then. :)  That&#39;s why my<br/>
original post to Joyce said I homeschooled/unschooled.  Otherwise I<br/>
would have just said unschooled.  I think when I talk to others I<br/>
sometimes say something like &#39;I basically unschooled.&#39; I don&#39;t remember<br/>
ever saying my site was about unschooling.<br/>
