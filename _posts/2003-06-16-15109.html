That&#39;s interesting, but it had to do with the pronunciations of people who <br/>
are online and were already interested and found that survey site.<br/>
<br/>
What they captured was largely the migrations of people.<br/>
<br/>
In NW New Mexico there are blocks that match West Texas.  It&#39;s an oil-field <br/>
area, and they imported Texans, years ago.  There&#39;s another block in New Mexico <br/>
that keeps standing out as a different color.  It&#39;s Rio Rancho, which is FULL <br/>
of New Yorkers.  Didn&#39;t even exist until the 1970&#39;s, and the lots had been <br/>
sold in little free advertising booklets in New York subways (and nowhere else).<br/>
<br/>
If they really want to map dialect instead of migration, they need to go out <br/>
and record grandmothers who haven&#39;t moved in their whole lives.<br/>
<br/>
It was interesting to look at the maps, but creeped me out with the lack of <br/>
overall validity.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yep. And I&#39;m going to say---without a doubt---that those folks that responded <br/>
from SC were fairly educated---and probably spent a great deal of time out of <br/>
state! <br/>
<br/>
My dialect was very similar to what was recorded, but it&#39;s NOT what is said <br/>
around these here parts! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I need to go back when I have a few more minutes and see what &quot;my&quot; results <br/>
are (vs the state&#39;s), but from what I&#39;ve seen already, it&#39;s bogus!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-279706425">I assumed that what they were looking for was exactly what they asked <br/>
for - the dialects as currently spoken by the people actually living, <br/>
now, in those locations.  I thought the migration of dialects was the <br/>
most interesting aspect.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1649867027">As someone who took the survey I was told to base it on where I grew up. I<br/>
read about it in the newspaper & thought it would be interesting to take. I<br/>
can still log in & change my answers if I want. I logged in & this is from<br/>
the instruction page.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Please answer all questions. Please answer based on what you knew/used in<br/>
the place in which you acquired your dialect features. For example, if you<br/>
did not know the word &quot;cruller&quot; until you moved from where you grew up, then<br/>
answer as though you did not know it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 I was in the majority percentage for my area on almost everything. I live<br/>
within 2 miles of where I grew up.<br/>
