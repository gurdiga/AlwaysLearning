My name is Suzette and I have 4 kids ages 15, 13, 11 and 6. We have been unschooling since the oldest were 9, 7 and 5. My 13, actually almost 14 yr old, wants to play high school football. He is wanting to try highschool because he thinks the football team will make fun of him for not going to the school and being homeschooled. He is also VERY social and I think he is looking forward to that part of school. My suspicion is that he will not like all the academic demands and will end up quitting but who knows?? My question or dilemma is his lack of math experience. He has had no interest in doing any formal kind of math. I&#39;m sure he has been learning mathematical concepts along the way but he would be lost in a 9th grade math class for sure. He is saying he wants to catch up and be ready to go next August. How do I go about this? I was thinking a math tutor? He really doesn&#39;t like me &quot;teaching&quot; him. What does he need to learn in order to succeed? I doubt he has to go back and learn everything...for example probably doesn&#39;t need long division? I think as long as he knows WHEN to divide and can work a calculater that should be fine? I just don&#39;t know exactly where to start in order to have him ready for high school or somewhat ready anyway. Any thoughts or advice will be greatly appreciated. I think due to his motivation to play football he will learn quickly.  <br/>

There are a lot of great free resources on line  and Khan Academy is great. I have used it as well as my kids. One of the best in my opinion. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-633313487">Look for text/workbook used for adult education or used in community<br/>
college developmental classes for &quot;Basic Math&quot;.  First 8 grades of<br/>
arithmetic can easily be completed in one &quot;semester&quot; by a motivated<br/>
student.<br/>
<br/>
If it were me, I would also look at a basic algebra book.<br/>
It is possible that he could enroll in a &quot;night school&quot;  class to cover<br/>
basic math.   These adult or community classes seldom have an age limit.<br/>
It would be &quot;formal kind of math&quot; but if he sees the reason for putting<br/>
forth the effort and if he realizes he won&#39;t need to invest more than about<br/>
60 hours total then it may be worthwhile. I personally think these type<br/>
focused classes are more useful than the &quot;GED prep&quot; classes.<br/>
<br/>
Many states place previous years standardized tests along with answers on<br/>
the state education authority website.  Can be a fun way for him to figure<br/>
out exactly what he needs to know to be &quot;caught up&quot;.  Here is a link to<br/>
some of the tests in Texas<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.tea.state.tx.us/index3.aspx?id=44&menu_id=793.">http://www.tea.state.tx.us/index3.aspx?id=44&menu_id=793.</a>  I assume you are<br/>
NOT in Texas since it seems your son has the option of playing on the<br/>
school&#39;s football team while remaining homeschooled.<br/>

Hands down, Kahn Academy!  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">http://www.khanacademy.org/</a><br/>
<br/>
Really, though, he may not need to know anything more than what he already knows to be caught up.  My oldest daughter who isn&#39;t the least bit mathematically inclined did a college placement test and did average on the math portion.  Not great, she told me, but the same level as almost every other incoming student.  She never had a math lesson in her life.  I only knew that she could do calculations in her head from going grocery shopping with her and witnessing her calculate very quickly which item would be the best deal.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-264742332">I would check with the school itself (it sounds like you have a specific school in mind). They may be able to recommend resources for catching up or at least let you know what he needs to cover. Then I&#39;d use a combination of workbooks and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.khanacademy.org/.">http://www.khanacademy.org/.</a> I&#39;d only look at a tutor if it was the easiest way for my son, not as a first resort. If I was looking for a tutor I&#39;d talk very thoroughly about my requirements or there might be a danger of tutoring being long and protracted. <br/>
<br/>
If your son is motivated he should be able to get to a level where he doesn&#39;t stick out too much in class. Don&#39;t forget not all students will be competent at all the topics they&#39;ve covered at school.<br/>

The noticeable ones, the ones who will seem like &quot;all the kids&quot;, are the ones whose brains work well with school and the popular ones who may be good at redirecting attention away from their understanding.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1957847292">Vocabulary might be all he needs.  If he can learn the names of mathematical ideas, understanding the terminology might help him see that he knows the concepts, just not by those names.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen that with all of my kids as they learned formal math in community college classes.  Marty LOVES the mathematical parts of economics (and the other parts, too).  Holly, like Keith, likes the elegance of algebra and geometry.<br/>
<br/>
A google search for the state curriculum for that grade level in your area might give you an outline and vocabulary.  Maybe look for the grade below the grade he&#39;s going into, and remind him (and yourself) that most teachers don&#39;t complete that ideal list in one year, and that most kids don&#39;t learn what IS presented.  Being behind isn&#39;t &quot;behind.&quot;  Most kids are technically behind.  About a third of them aren&#39;t even bothering to try.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-504156201">Definitely check with the school and ask what math classes are available/required, maybe check with the coach or other parents of kids on the football team to find out which classes their kids are taking. For 9th grade, they almost certainly have a pre-algebra course which he could very well fit into with no prep other than some basic vocabulary, if he&#39;s nervous about diving straight in to algebra or geometry (whatever they do first). But all the other kids going into the regular algebra or geometry program are likely to be just as overwhelmed as he might be - it&#39;s all new to all of them.<br/>
<br/>
 You could check graduation requirements to get an idea of what&#39;s expected, too. Just doing a quick search, I see some states only specify a certain number of years of mathematics instruction, not which courses. Some don&#39;t require more than first year algebra to graduate - including some which require math instruction all four years of high school! And of those which do require more, it&#39;s not *much* more - a second year of algebra and/or geometry. So there Will be basic math classes available. <br/>

I think she means required when he gets there, not &quot;required&quot; before he gets there.<br/>

And he could use the khan academy videos in conjunction with homework assignments.  He doesn&#39;t need to know all that before he goes to the class.<br/>
