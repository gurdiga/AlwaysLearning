&lt;&lt; I wish I could say I haven&#39;t heard anyone tell a child, &quot;You <br/>
aren&#39;t hungry&quot; or &quot;No, you can&#39;t have more to eat.&quot;, but my son was <br/>
recently told this by a relative at the family Christmas dinner.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thinking over a few-hundred-years span, and not over a last-80 years, <br/>
Christmas dinner  and Thanksgiving should be a feasts--and feast means TOO <br/>
much food, extra food, left-overs.  My mother-in-law, too, plans just enough <br/>
scant portions to go around, and rarely extras, even at Thanksgiving.<br/>
<br/>
In the SCA, we have excuses for feasts frequently--coronations, revels after <br/>
tournaments, and when people have been planning portions for 300 people and <br/>
suchlike, I&#39;ve often reminded them that feasts are just meals if there&#39;s not <br/>
so much that everyone goes home stuffed and there are leftovers to distribute <br/>
to the poor.<br/>
<br/>
Often the cooks take home leftovers, or leftovers are saved to make lunch at <br/>
a tournament the next day.  But sometimes the Albuquerque group has take <br/>
leftovers to the homeless shelter.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2026021364">The funny thing is, my extended family is relatively well-off.  At <br/>
holidays, an abundant feast is cooked, but children who want extra <br/>
portions are always cautioned against being &quot;greedy&quot;.  An attitude of <br/>
scarcity in the midst of abundance, in my estimation.<br/>
