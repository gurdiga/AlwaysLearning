<div id="ygrps-yiv-643631375">Hello, it is Mary, now know as having 2 kids who do not particularly care <br/>
for each other, a 7 year old who likes to vent at me and a passionate 5 year <br/>
old who loves TV. I also have a 2 year old nursing toddler. We have been at <br/>
home learning since the birth of my oldest. I&#39;m very impressed with the <br/>
feedback and personal stories regarding TV. I went TV free some 10 years <br/>
ago. For me this was very enlightning. Maybe I learned more about myself in <br/>
6 months than my entire childhood. The TV was unlimited in my house I grew <br/>
up in and a major substitute for an available parent. I also find it non <br/>
communitive in that people around me veg out, myself included. It puts me <br/>
into an alpha state of consciousness very quickly. I usually do not remember <br/>
what I watch, the story line, the characters. Now, if I read a book, I <br/>
remember forever. Also when I experience something , I retain/remember all <br/>
the details. I love live theater because I retain what I saw and can develop <br/>
an opinion later. With TV, I veg, it is lost time to me. Now that I&#39;m older, <br/>
a mere 35, my time is important. I have loads of things I want to do and <br/>
learn. No time for TV viewing, though it sounds like I&#39;m missing good <br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
Next Topic:<br/>
<br/>
Classes. We have great social gathering with our homeschool group. We have <br/>
put on many wonderful performances, learned about ancient cultures, have <br/>
eaten tons of various cultures foods, played games, done crafts, made peace <br/>
workshops,... I&#39;ve only been invovled for 4 years with the groups. What is <br/>
so nice about our homeschooling community is that each group activity is <br/>
truly a social gathering for families. One week it is our family providing <br/>
snacks and scripts about the Celtic culture. Another week, another family. <br/>
Sometimes we do things for 6 weeks or so, other times its a one time deal. <br/>
The synergy is incredible. The older kids help pull in shy or hesitant kids <br/>
in a very gentle way. The kids can listen or not, participate or not. They <br/>
absorb, they play. We, the adults provide the ideas, ususally because one of <br/>
our kids are into it, and then we grow from there. Lately it has been acting <br/>
for many families. We have learned that structure inhibits us and we reach <br/>
beyond the box and invent our own ways. Families come when they want, no <br/>
expectations. I dig our group and our social gatherings. We made soap, <br/>
candles, bath salts, all together, for gift giving. So fun to be with <br/>
friends always learning.<br/>
<br/>
Baby is now asleep on my lap, TV is on with The Princess Diary. I&#39;m taking <br/>
care or my 3 1/2 year old neice for 5 days. She is playing with Legos. It <br/>
snowed in Davis Ca. on Monday. It is very cold. We went to the Raptor Center <br/>
and saw loads of rescued birds, hiked with some other homeschooling families <br/>
(one of our social gatherings aka classes) played at McDolalds. It is 2 pm <br/>
now. Thank you all for throwing the party. I would love to donate my TV, but <br/>
I live in a family and would offend those here who love it. My passionate <br/>
son will get to see TV, though I feel it isn&#39;t the best for his developing <br/>
self. Constant compromise.<br/>
<br/>
Mary H.<br/>

choose the printed word for learning if they can help it.<br/>

 SOOooooo....does anyone know some good video sources<br/>
for Unschooling ideas/information?  John Holt anything<br/>

unschooling conferences---that not only feature some of the most <br/>
knowledgeable unschoolers around---but are also INTERACTIVE! The husband and <br/>
son could ask questions until the wee hours! &gt;BWG&lt;<br/>
