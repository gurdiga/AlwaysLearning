<div id="ygrps-yiv-1555703610">We had a very similar situation come up in our hs support group.  Our group<br/>
has its own Girl Scout troop.  At a planning meeting, it was announced that<br/>
most of the moms wanted to splits with GS to go with a knock-off<br/>
ultra-conservative group because GS is too soft on &quot;the gay issue.&quot;  Many of<br/>
the moms talked about how offended they were by GS&#39;s stance on the topic.  I<br/>
stated that I wasn&#39;t offended but would discuss it with Adriane (then 10).<br/>
<br/>
When I talked with Adriane about it, she was shocked at these women and<br/>
immediately said she didn&#39;t want to belong to that group anymore.  However,<br/>
we continue to see these women and children at support group functions.<br/>
Adriane and I both continue to be genuinely friendly.  I have had quite a<br/>
few cold shoulders from that circle but Adriane has faired better and is<br/>
very pleased with herself for making decisions that back up her morals.<br/>
<br/>
Julie--who is also pretty proud of Adriane</div>
