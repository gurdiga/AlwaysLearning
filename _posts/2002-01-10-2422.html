<br/>
KITTY LITTER CAKE<br/>
1 spice or German chocolate cake mix<br/>
1 white cake mix<br/>
1 large pkg vanilla instant pudding mix<br/>
1 pkg vanilla sandwich cookies<br/>
Green food coloring<br/>
12 small Tootsie Rolls<br/>
1 new (and definitely unused) kitty litter pan<br/>
1 new plastic kitty litter pan liner<br/>
1 new Pooper Scooper<br/>
<br/>
Prepare cake mixes and bake according to directions (any size pans).<br/>
Prepare pudding mix and chill until ready to assemble.<br/>
Crumble white sandwich cookies in small batches in food processor, scraping<br/>
often. Set aside all but about 1/4 cup.<br/>
To the 1/4 cup cookie crumbs, add a few drops green food coloring and mix<br/>
using a fork or shake in a jar.<br/>
When cakes are cooled to room temperature, crumble into a large bowl. Toss<br/>
with half the remaining white cookie crumbs and the chilled pudding. (Mix in<br/>
just enough of the pudding to moisten it. You don&#39;t want it soggy. Combine<br/>
gently).<br/>
Line new, clean kitty litter box.<br/>
Put mixture into litter box.<br/>
Put three unwrapped Tootsie rolls in a microwave safe dish and heat until<br/>
soft and pliable.<br/>
Shape ends so they are no longer blunt, curving slightly. Repeat with 3 more<br/>
Tootsie rolls and bury in mixture.<br/>
Sprinkle the other half of cookie crumbs over top.<br/>
Scatter the green cookie crumbs lightly over the top. (This is supposed to<br/>
look like the chlorophyll in kitty litter.)<br/>
Heat 3 Tootsie Rolls in the microwave until almost melted.<br/>
Scrape them on top of the cake; sprinkle with cookie crumbs.<br/>
Spread remaining Tootsie Rolls over the top; take one and heat until<br/>
pliable, hang it over the side of the kitty litter box, sprinkling it<br/>
lightly with cookie crumbs.<br/>
Place the box on a newspaper and sprinkle a few of the cookie crumbs around.<br/>
Serve with a new pooper scooper.<br/>
