<div id="ygrps-yiv-2105409701">I&#39;m so glad I found this group was beginning to think that I was all <br/>
alone out here.  I never knew how to put into words my philosophy and <br/>
idea of learning versus schooling.  When I read about the difference <br/>
between principles & rules that sort of summed it up for me.  I have <br/>
homeschooled since 1985 but my idea was unschool and my school <br/>
teacher husband&#39;s idea of school at home for his sons.  So we got <br/>
something in between and that did not work out so well.  I gave up <br/>
and sent all seven sons to school after the stillbirth of my eighth <br/>
son.  Since that time I&#39;ve had two daughters and in 2001 one of my <br/>
twin sons died at the age of 20 by getting hit by a car.  About 6 <br/>
years ago we moved and took the kids out of school and have been <br/>
somewhat unschooling my sons 16y, 15y, 13y, 12y, and daughters 9y and <br/>
8y ever since.  15 year old son wants to go to school because he <br/>
wants to meet friends.   He loves to skateboard and says everyone <br/>
skates with their friends from school and they always laugh when he <br/>
says he&#39;s homeschooled.  My husband comes from a long line of <br/>
teachers and they think we are absolutely crazy to let the kids learn <br/>
on their own.  We belong to a Baptist church but we are quite the <br/>
anomally having more than two children and unschooling. My children <br/>
resent being different so they try to fit in by wearing the baggy <br/>
pants and listening to this rap music like their peers at church.  <br/>
They play Halo 2 online as often as they are able.  They complain <br/>
that I&#39;ve not taught them to spell and yet they do very little if any <br/>
reading.  My house is full of books and I must admit much unused <br/>
curriculum.    Thanks for being out there in more ways than one.  <br/>

That might make you feel better.<br/>
<br/>
-=-They play Halo 2 online as often as they are able.-=-<br/>
<br/>
My boys played it a LOT when it was new, and now my daughter is pretty <br/>
involved in it, mostly for the social aspect.  She&#39;s made friends in several <br/>
countries.<br/>
<br/>
-=-They complain that I&#39;ve not taught them to spell and yet they do very <br/>

<br/>
I didn&#39;t teach mine to spell, they didn&#39;t do a lot of reading, and from <br/>
instant messages and e-mails and reading the cards for collectible card games and <br/>
the instructions for games they&#39;ve learned to spell and write.   Halo II isnt&#39; <br/>
the best for that, as it&#39;s done vocally.  There are other X-Box games that do <br/>
involve a lot of reading. My boys are asleep so I can&#39;t ask the names, but the <br/>
Star Wars games, I know, are largely text-based, and Morrowwind is a <br/>
BEAUTIFUL game Marty played for a long time when it was new.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Mine too.<br/>
Read here to feel better about that.<br/>

<br/>
I think &quot;somewhat unschooling&quot; would be really frustrating.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry about your stillbirth and your son&#39;s death.  The stress and grief <br/>
couldn&#39;t have been good for the other kids, either.<br/>
<br/>
We can help you get to all-the-way unschooling, at least for your younger <br/>
kids, maybe, if you want.<br/>
<br/>

Morrowind?<br/>
 <br/>
-=-An epic, open-ended single-player RPG, Morrowind allows you to  create and <br/>
play any kind of character imaginable. You can choose to follow the  main <br/>
storyline and find the source of the evil blight that plagues the land, or  set <br/>
off on your own to explore strange locations and develop your character  based <br/>
on their actions throughout the game. Featuring stunning 3D graphics,  <br/>
open-ended gameplay, and an incredible level of detail and interactivity,  Morrowind <br/>
offers a gameplay experience like no other.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
There are add-ons too, so if you&#39;re going to buy it, get a gamer geek&#39;s  help <br/>
so you don&#39;t just buy the expansion set and not the main game first (or  with <br/>
it).<br/>
