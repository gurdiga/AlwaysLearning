<div id="ygrps-yiv-126680593">I know there are a few folks who are alternative (well, ok, we are all <br/>
alternative-um, folks that are GLBT) on this list...<br/>
<br/>
A few weeks ago I sent information about the homeschooling camp we go to <br/>
every so often.  The camp is again in April (23-25) in Southern <br/>
California. <br/>
<br/>
I just found out that the same UU camp is having a Rainbow Family camp <br/>
for GLBT families and their hetersexual friends, family and supporters <br/>
(pflag people often go) at the end of March.  This is an annual event... <br/>
My kids and I are going this weekend as I am goign to try to write an <br/>
article about the camp (both homeschooling and the rainbow camp, and <br/>
also this artist they have at the camp...<br/>
 <br/>
The camp is by Big Bear in Southern California.  There is a map at the <br/>
website.  I can&#39;t speak highly enough of this camp, and the people that <br/>
work there.  If you go to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.uucamp.org/">http://www.uucamp.org/</a> you can get more <br/>
information about both the homeschooling camp and the Rainbow Family <br/>
camp.  I also have the flyers for both camps on my computer and I can <br/>
email them to you individually.<br/>
<br/>
Please feel free to pass this on to others.. They especially want to get <br/>
more people attending the homeschooling and rainbow family camp.  <br/>
