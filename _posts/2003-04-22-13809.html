<div id="ygrps-yiv-1204983877">Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I&#39;m a little goofy today and have reading posts all morning and have <br/>
completely forgotton who originally posted about the MIL, previous teacher <br/>
and the people concerned that our kids are going to be made fun of for skills <br/>
they have or have not learned due to our choices. Oh yes and the one child <br/>
who is worried about being fat at the age of 8. <br/>
<br/>
So I apologize for my confusion, but while folding laundry the 12:00 news <br/>
just came on and one of the lead stories is about how bullying and bashing of <br/>
schooled children is now at anyone&#39;s fingertips. I was barely paying <br/>
attention until I heard that this internet site has been up for 3 years now <br/>
and is growing at a tremendous rate and is now in the hundreds of thousands <br/>
of registered users. Unfortunately, being out of it a bit today, I missed <br/>
what the link was, not because I have any intention on visiting it, but <br/>
because I thought it would be wonderful ammo for the argument against sending <br/>
a child to school for socialization.Just another thing we can add to the list <br/>
of stuff we don&#39;t want our kids &quot;Exposed&quot; to. I will try to watch the same <br/>
channel for their 3:00 edition so as to get the link and post it here and <br/>
then all those people who think our kids should be exposed to the social <br/>
environment of school can be given the link and they can search for positives <br/>
in which they would prefer their grandchildren, nieces, nephews, cousins and <br/>
children of friends not miss out on.<br/>
<br/>
Peace to all of you.<br/>
Rhonda<br/>
