My son  has food allergies. When he eats certain foods that his body cannot <br/>
process  right, he breaks out into a rash. In order to make him feel <br/>
comfortable and  happy being around the foods he cannot have, I always make sure to have <br/>
a  substitute for him. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My son has allergies, too. Sadly, there is just not a substitute that is  <br/>
acceptable to him. Raw apples give him rashes (as well as watermelon) and though  <br/>
he can eat cooked apples, applesauce, apple pie, stewed apples, apple butter <br/>
or  any of the other substitutes we&#39;ve tried just don&#39;t satisfy his need for <br/>
raw  apples sometimes. Organic apples have the same effect as <br/>
traditionally-grown  apples and sometimes, the rash is just worth it to him. Sometimes, he <br/>
decided  the rash is worth it and I&#39;ll slice and peel an apple and he&#39;ll take one  <br/>
bite and the inside of his mouth will start to itch and he sadly pushes the  <br/>
apple away and says he is done. Sometimes we just crave that *thing* and a  <br/>
substitute just doesn&#39;t satisfy the craving.<br/>

Have you tried Asian Pears.  My kids mistake them for apples all the time.<br/>
Also, some crunchy pears taste like apples, especially the green An&#39;jou<br/>
pears.  Though with an allergy going on, his pallate may be more sensitive<br/>
than ours!  Have you tried other types of apples?   May not make a<br/>
difference, but it might.<br/>
<br/>
Just some thoughts.<br/>

Strawberries are famous for causing rashes in babies, aren&#39;t they?<br/>
<br/>
Some of those things,  kids grow out of.   I think there are some  <br/>
foods that are hard for a child&#39;s digestive system to handle, and  <br/>
people develop at different rates in all their systems (the systems  <br/>
with lots of evidence, like coordination/strength/walking, and those  <br/>
we can&#39;t see).<br/>
<br/>
There are foods kids don&#39;t want or can&#39;t handle that adults like  <br/>
lots.  Dark chocolate.  Locally to me, green chile.  It&#39;s a food  <br/>
staple in New Mexico.  You can get green chile as a burger ingredient  <br/>
at McDonald&#39;s or Wendy&#39;s.   But little kids don&#39;t want it and adults  <br/>
don&#39;t try to coax them to eat it.  They&#39;ll want it when they want it,  <br/>
or not.<br/>
<br/>
When unschooling parents treat other foods that way too, they end up  <br/>
with kids who like brie or spinach or artichokes or mushrooms earlier  <br/>
than some other families where kids are coerced to just try it, just  <br/>
taste it, or teased about not liking things, or pressured to clean  <br/>
their plates at each meal.<br/>
<br/>
And each child can choose foods that are comfortable to them in  <br/>
whatever ways their bodies are telling them is good.<br/>
<br/>
They can&#39;t hear and feel their bodies telling them anything as long  <br/>
as their moms are telling them what they feel or should feel or can&#39;t  <br/>
feel or should be ashamed for feeling.<br/>

Yup. And incontinence. So are melons.<br/>

<br/>
I have had adults completely flip out at me (including one famous<br/>
incident at a local Benihana, sigh) for the fact that my two year old,<br/>
Kestrel, *adores* spicy food. He will lick wasabe off his fingers and<br/>
ask for more. He will nibble on jalapenos. He will eat salsa with a<br/>
spoon. This is the child who, when he was a nursing infant of a few<br/>
weeks of age, if I ate a few pieces of bread, he&#39;d end up with blood<br/>
in his poop. Does this make any sense within our cultural belief that<br/>
bread is good but wasabe not so good? No. But it&#39;s what works *for<br/>
him*. And it is not at all what works for me, or for his older<br/>
brother. Both of us are fine with wheat, and can&#39;t handle spicy at<br/>
all.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; And each child can choose foods that are comfortable to them in<br/>
&gt; whatever ways their bodies are telling them is good.<br/>
<br/>
At two, I&#39;m still pointing out the connections. Kestrel can&#39;t make the<br/>
connection between the wheat and the blood yet (although now that he&#39;s<br/>
older, wheat also gives him tummy cramps, which are something we can<br/>
talk about that makes sense to him). But I am also responsible for<br/>
letting him go to town on the peppers, which have zero affect on him,<br/>
but apparently give bystanders fits. =)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; They can&#39;t hear and feel their bodies telling them anything as long<br/>
&gt; as their moms are telling them what they feel or should feel or can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; feel or should be ashamed for feeling.<br/>
<br/>
Rowan is five now, and utterly in touch with how food makes him feel.<br/>
I&#39;m 12 weeks pregnant, and a friend bought me a case of lollipops for<br/>
morning sickness. Rowan ate three or four of them in a row, declared<br/>
&quot;those are making my tummy and my hands go too fast. I&#39;m done.&quot; and<br/>
that was that. He eats one, every so often, but those pops have zero<br/>
power over him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-675385634">De...if the inside of his mouth starts to itch BEWARE ANAPHYLAXIS. Yes<br/>
I am shouting!<br/>
Look up the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis as soon as you can.<br/>
Email me if you need sites. Some allergies are too serious to ignore.<br/>
If the inside of my dds mouth starts to itch I have less than 10<br/>
minutes before full blown anaphylaxis sets in. We carry emergency<br/>
adrenaline at all times. This gives us time to get to the hospital. If<br/>
we do not inject within minutes of contact to an allergen she will<br/>
die. Children (and adults) can die of anaphylaxis within 30 minutes of<br/>
contact to an allergen. I have nearly lost her more than once.<br/>
<br/>
He may never have an anaphylatic reaction, but itching inside the<br/>
mouth or throat is such a biggie that you have scared me. Anaphylaxis<br/>
is serious and frightening. <br/>
