<div id="ygrps-yiv-680461916">I have a big problem with throwing out food.  Food is one of our biggest<br/>
expenditures each month and with 7 of us, there is usually someone who might<br/>
have wanted to eat what someone else wasted.<br/>
<br/>
Our priority here is nobody cares what you eat, but please eat what you get.<br/>
My kids are still fairly young and I get lots of individual servings of<br/>
pudding, applesauce, etc.  It never fails that whatever we have the least of<br/>
is everyone&#39;s choice du jour.  It was really bothersome to have someone<br/>
really wanting applesauce, the pantry is void of it because someone opened<br/>
up the last one and then tossed it in the trash.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are quite understanding and do very well with the request to simply<br/>
eat what they get out.<br/>
