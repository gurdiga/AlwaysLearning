<div id="ygrps-yiv-1823848201">The only potty problem is Faith, she is the oldest of the cats and is<br/>
disabled.  We think she is at least 12 and is living out her last years with<br/>
us.  From what the vets have figured, she was either hit by a car or kicked<br/>
and her hips were broken, by the time someone left her on the vet office<br/>
doorstep, she was about 5 years post injury and everything had fused<br/>
together.  She walks with a horrible limp, can&#39;t groom herself(when she<br/>
tries she goes into horrific muscle spasms).  We think the reason Faith has<br/>
(infrequent)accidents is because once she realizes she has to go, it is too<br/>
late.  Thankfully she stays in one of 2 places so it isn&#39;t hard to discover<br/>
problems.  Peaches and Tigger(both girls) have never sprayed(that I have<br/>
seen - in the almost 2 years we have had them) and they use the box<br/>
frequently.  We have Bailey the mutt and Amber the epileptic retriever and<br/>
they potty outside.   Aside from scooping outdoor doggy doo and changing the<br/>
litter box twice a week, pet potty is not a problem.  Also, the cats and<br/>
dogs get along so well.  We often find the dogs and Peaches and Tigger all<br/>
snuggled up with each other.  Faith likes to be left alone, and everyone<br/>
respects her decision.<br/>
<br/>
When Joe and I were first married he got me a cat who hated my guts and<br/>
would pee on me when I was sleeping, on my clothes if they were on the floor<br/>
or wherever I was sitting.  Needless to say she found new parents after 3<br/>
months.<br/>

<br/>
Our three cats will do that with each other--just a jumble of purr and fur<br/>
all squeezed into a basket together in the winter when it¹s cold.<br/>
<br/>
The pee problem is mostly with our youngest (two males are about 16, the<br/>
female is 8) who really needs to be Queen of the House and isn¹t allowed to<br/>
be. She¹s expressing her obvious displeasure. It¹s gotten better since she¹s<br/>
become Queen of the Master Bedroom and has her own litterbox up there.<br/>
<br/>
Tiger is the least dominant cat (what¹s the opposite of Alpha cat? Omega<br/>
cat?) and he sprays occasionally just because he¹s frustrated, I think.<br/>
<br/>
We got into the habit of scooping out the litterboxes whenever we walked by<br/>
them, so they¹re ridiculously clean (for litter boxes) all the time. It<br/>
didn¹t seem to make a big difference, but we¹ve been doing it for so long<br/>
now that it would feel weird not to. We also know the usual spray places, so<br/>
we check them daily and keep them clean. Sometimes we think about all the<br/>
hours we¹d save if we didn¹t have pets, but they delight us so much of the<br/>
time that I doubt we¹ll ever be pet-less.<br/>
<br/>
Faith is obviously very lucky to have you. What a life she must have had<br/>
before.... <br/>

Ack! Do you know if she did that to her new people?<br/>

I think it partly depends who else is around (other male animals?) and how <br/>
old they were when they were fixed.<br/>
<br/>
We had one who persisted after fixation.  (Or after we broke him.  I prefer <br/>
to think of it is &quot;surgically discouraged.&quot;)<br/>

<br/>
If they learned to spray before they were fixed then<br/>
they will continue to do so even after they&#39;ve had the<br/>
op. That&#39;s why you&#39;re supposed to get males fixed<br/>
between 6 and 8 months (before the instinct to spray<br/>
kicks in).<br/>
When I was a kid, we had a cat that used to pee in the<br/>
toilet when it was raining. We never trained him to do<br/>
it. He used to watch us and just caught on that if he<br/>
went in there, he wouldn&#39;t have to go out in the rain<br/>
(I guess).<br/>
Let&#39;s hear it for cat flaps!!! <br/>

I had a friend whose cat started peeing in the toilet one day after watching <br/>
her intently.  She said it was kinda creepy--she went to the bathroom with <br/>
her way-grown cat (no kitten) in there sitting in the corner not kinda <br/>
casually looking but REALLY looking, thinking, twitching and staring.  After <br/>
that the cat always went in the toilet.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I love cats.  I had a friend who&#39;s cat learned to ring<br/>
the doorbell to get into the house.  The cat jumped up<br/>
and hit the bell with it&#39;s paw over and over until<br/>
someone let it in.  Obviously must have picked it up<br/>
from watching people ring the bell and get let into<br/>
the house.  :-)<br/>

Often when we¹re in the bathroom one of the cats will come in and use the<br/>
litter box. I¹d be thrilled to find one on the toilet (a cat, not a litter<br/>
box), but I doubt it will happen. I wonder about a litter box with a hole<br/>
cut in the bottom of it strapped to the toilet seat....<br/>
