all know that the psychology and theory of education<br/>
was all coined and studied and written up AFTER the<br/>
fact, to justify what they were ALREADY doing in the<br/>
factory style institutions, which were designed to be<br/>
child minders for workers, which also produced more<br/>
workers.  I wonder, how much more &quot;folk wisdom&quot; will<br/>
we have to have AH HA! moments about in western<br/>
culture, redicovering that HOLY COW - it really worked<br/>
all along! before the officials and experts stop being<br/>
hailed as geniuses.<br/>

Sorry if I am not coherent.  I have been really<br/>
nauseated and dizzy lately.  Storm season beginning. <br/>
Maybe I should have a cat scan or something, cause<br/>
these pressure changes really get to me this year. <br/>
Once this spring, when a storm system rolled over, I<br/>
could not get out of bed all day without throwing up<br/>
every time.<br/>

Hi, Nancy --<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry to hear that you are not feeling well.  I hope you can figure<br/>
out what is causing this.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-516145452">WOW!<br/>
<br/>
That happens to me too! I grew up in Puerto Rico where it basically <br/>
rains every day and where we get at least 12 big storms a year (one <br/>
per month --not counting hurricanes). I know rain. I can smell rain <br/>
coming. Storms? That&#39;s different --my blood pressure is low to begin <br/>
with but when a storm is coming, forget it, I feel like I have a car <br/>
on top of me. I get migraines that will not go away until the sky <br/>
cracks open. Even breathing is hard on my body.<br/>
<br/>
I try to make sure I drink tons of water but I also have looked at <br/>
Ayurveda for help. I usually make a tea with ginger and cayenne <br/>
pepper to bring my blood pressure up. It helps A LOT. Also <br/>
exercising, especially if I do some yoga. Stay away from starches, <br/>
cow milk and anything that will slow down your digestion. Anything <br/>
spicy and aromatic but light is good. There is also help in <br/>
homeopathy and I think Nux Vomica or Sepia can help as well (I have <br/>
to check).<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I completely understand what you are talking about. It has <br/>
taken me years to find a way out of storm weather hell.<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>
Liza<br/>
