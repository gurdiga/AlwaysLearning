&lt;&lt; (The real question is:  Can we see it?) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
oooh....and here it was about not letting fear control me any longer!!<br/>
Now I feel the nervous pit in my stomache.....LOL<br/>
I write a lot for myself, ideas come and if I don&#39;t get them down they are <br/>
gone. <br/>
These thoughts came to me during a run this week.....so if you really want to <br/>
read it I&#39;ll put it here for perusal.<br/>
gulp.<br/>
Now I said it.<br/>
As long as you (and anyone else) remember I&#39;m a writer for me, not for <br/>
publication at this point..... So my lack of skills might show to some of you <br/>
more eloquent writers.<br/>
It&#39;s just about how unschooling has brought me to the point of not letting <br/>
fear control, but joy!! Even on the morning run.<br/>

Now, as Sandra said recently, I&#39;m only 30 or 40 seconds away from knowing <br/>
everything!!!<br/>

Ok, this I can follow. I know the differences between Greek and Roman cultures, I know why we went to the moon, but I didn&#39;t know that 2 + 2 doesn&#39;t always equal 4...<br/>
<br/>
Can you explain?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s a test of sorts to see if you can think outside what is given to you.<br/>
It&#39;s just an exercise to look at things differently.  A trick of sorts to<br/>
look behind the initial representation of something. A way to get creative<br/>
energies moving.<br/>
<br/>
The concept is that numbers are not always whole, complete, never changing<br/>
items.  The easiest way I look at it is with lumps of clay.  If you have two<br/>
lumps of clay and put of them together with two more lumps of clay, what<br/>
have you got? It could be four lumps of clay.  Or maybe the first two were<br/>
put together in one lump and now you have three.  Or now maybe all were put<br/>
together and all you have is one.  Or maybe you have a whole set of cups and<br/>
saucers.  Or one grand pot. Or an electrical insulator.  Another example<br/>
that I heard recently on this list (when I used the same phrase) would be if<br/>
you dealing with armies. Would you have one a big army? An alliance? Many<br/>
many many platoons? A lot of arguing and tired feet?  If you have two<br/>
arguments and add two more arguments is it a discussion?<br/>
<br/>
What if one of the twos was negative?<br/>
<br/>
The exercise goes on.  Conceptually what is a number?  A name? A thing?  A<br/>
model? How do &quot;things&quot; change? Things you put a name to.  How does that<br/>
named thing change when things around it change? Is a named thing constant<br/>
because it has a name? And on and on and on...<br/>
<br/>
It was a rare Education major that even wanted to have this discussion in my<br/>
classes.<br/>
