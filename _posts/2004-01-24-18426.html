Somewhere there&#39;s something I&#39;ve written on deschooling Cameron. He was in <br/>
private school from pre-K through sixth grade.<br/>
<br/>
If someone (Joyce?, Sandra?) knows where it is, could you please post it? I <br/>
don&#39;t have one handy. I&#39;ve written it so many times, I feel that I could <br/>
probably write it in my sleep----but it ain&#39;t gonna&#39; to happen tonight! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It mostly takes patience on YOUR part and throwing yourself into your own <br/>
interests. Keep offering whatever you&#39;re doing to him, but don&#39;t push.<br/>
<br/>
Cameron took eighteen months of *literally*: eating, sleeping, watching tv, <br/>
talking on the phone, and healing before he &quot;came out&quot; of his school-hell. He&#39;s <br/>
now *so* interested and interesting that it&#39;s scary! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If no one can find it for you, I&#39;ll try to spit another one out.<br/>
<br/>
Life is indeed different for those of us that must DEschool ourselves and our <br/>
children than it is for those fortunate ones who &quot;get it&quot; before they send <br/>
their kids to school.<br/>

What is most important and valuable about the home as a base for children&#39;s growth into the world is not that it is a better school than the schools, but that it isn&#39;t a school at all.  John Holt<br/>

<br/>
No, no, no!!!:) At least she said it sweetly...but I do not like these kind of responses to children&#39;s boredom.<br/>
The reason being, I remember as a child my mother inviting me to do chores with her so I wouldn&#39;t be bored anymore....DUH, that&#39;s NOT what I wanted to do, MORE boring stuff!!<br/>
It would have done wonders for our relationship and increased my potential to learn ten-fold if she&#39;d helped me find something really fun to do.<br/>
The call &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot; is a request for help. It&#39;s a chance for a parent to interact with their child in a meaningful way. There&#39;s nothing wrong with inviting the child to do what you are doing, but if that doesn&#39;t interest them, why not brainstorm TOGETHER and come up with something neat?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure that it is always a request for help.  It could just be a <br/>
statement of fact, how a person is feeling at that particular moment in time.  Not <br/>
always is it a statement of I&#39;m bored and I want you to help me fix it.  I <br/>
think that inviting a child to sit and help or watch could be a good thing.  The <br/>
person didn&#39;t say that the Mom said &quot;help me do the dishes and you won&#39;t be <br/>
bored.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
 She stated &gt;&gt; &quot;She said she just very sweetly pulled up a chair next<br/>
to her wherever she was working/doing something,<br/>
patted the seat invitingly, and said, &quot;why don&#39;t you<br/>

<br/>
The Mom could have been engaged in something that is her passion something <br/>
she is really interested in, and that might give the child the chance to see the <br/>
Mom really passionate about something.  See that the Mom has interesting <br/>
things going on in her life.  It might be something the child would be interested <br/>
in as well.<br/>
<br/>
I can see helping a child find some ideas if the child wants that kind of <br/>
help.  Just not sure that every &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot; statement is asking for that kind of <br/>
help.<br/>
Just a couple of thoughts.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sure in a family of 10 children being invited to<br/>
do something with mom meant there would be some rare<br/>
one-on-one time while Mom was fixing dinner, folding<br/>
laundry, or in this particular family, playing piano<br/>
or running her homemade bread baking business.<br/>
<br/>
She never forced them to do whatever she was doing,<br/>
just invited them to sit with her until they thought<br/>
of something else to do.  <br/>
<br/>
And knowing my friend, the child didn&#39;t sit there in a<br/>
time-out not talking, but she engaged them in<br/>
discussing activities or their thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
In a family of 10 kids, I never saw chore charts or<br/>
reward charts or anything like that, either. It was a<br/>
mystery to me how everything got done, and her kids<br/>
were always around the house doing things like three<br/>
would playing their instruments together, another two<br/>
would be playing house, two more would be outside on<br/>
the swings, and two more playing legos or sword<br/>
fighting or whatever, and the baby would be watching<br/>
it all from the arms of one of them or her swing.<br/>
<br/>
It was the calmest happiest family I&#39;ve ever seen, but<br/>
I couldn&#39;t begin to tell you how.  LOL!  I always left<br/>
their house wondering why mine seemed so chaotic in<br/>
comparison, with at the time just two kids.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure they weren&#39;t perfect, and I know there were<br/>
health problems with a few of the kids, and &quot;learning<br/>
problems&quot;, but the mom took everything in stride and<br/>
the oldest ones seem to have gone on to be happy and<br/>
successful in their chosen paths.  The middle and<br/>
young ones are still home and appear to be happy and<br/>
kind hearted.<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, I just threw the story out there as one way I<br/>
saw someone deal with the question of &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So...should we try to help the kids solve their<br/>
boredom, or should we let it be fodder for creativity?<br/>

How about helping our kids use their boredom as fodder for creativity?<br/>
