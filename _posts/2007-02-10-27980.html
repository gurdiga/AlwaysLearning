<div id="ygrps-yiv-1379032928">Wow! This looks interesting. Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We may explore zoos and science museums, I guess. I&#39;m in California, but<br/>
I&#39;ll pass along the website to see if anything sparks.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s into rabbits, now. She has convinced us she will care for them. I<br/>
wonder. do unschooler parents request a book report or research, or is it<br/>
&quot;just&quot; experience? I fear we are going to be taken over by animals! There is<br/>
a zoo magnet high school, that she might enjoy later. I just don&#39;t<br/>
understand how the unschooler thing works when it&#39;s time to get a college<br/>
degree or a job. Please enlighten me.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
All the best,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hey, she sounds like fun! Does she like movies *about* bugs? There&#39;s <br/>
a whole glorious genre to explore, from the tacky B-movies to the <br/>
really chic artsy films like *Microcosmos* - has she seen that? Its <br/>
scrumptious! <br/>
<br/>
That may all sound beside the point since the question was:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How does one unschool a reluctant learner?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But really, the difference between a &quot;reluctant&quot; learner and an <br/>
enthusiastic one is that for the latter learning is part of her own <br/>
internal process of joyful discovery. There&#39;s nothing joyful about <br/>
being &quot;made&quot; to read or &quot;do math&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
What would happen if you helped her explore her interests rather <br/>
than insisting she ingest something unpalattable to her? Where might <br/>
she go, what might she do with animals or bugs or movies or some <br/>
combination - or maybe one of those would lead her in a direction <br/>
neither of you can yet imagine. <br/>
<br/>
She may not be able to articulate what she *wants* to do at this <br/>
point, so you may have to offer or strew ideas - but they should be <br/>
Fun ideas, offered for the potential joy, not entomology textbooks <br/>
or worksheets on animal tracks. Here&#39;s something fun, although you <br/>
may be half a world away for all I know, its a neat idea:<br/>

uiuc.edu/entomology/egsa/ifff.html<br/>
(Its an Insect Fear Film Festival and there&#39;s a list of all the <br/>
films they&#39;ve shown in the past if she&#39;s interested).<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also no need to &quot;tie in&quot; to some strange new curriculum of <br/>
Animals-Bugs-and-Film, but the bug thing is really exciting to *me* <br/>
so I can&#39;t resist. That&#39;s a place to *start*, but don&#39;t discount <br/>
anything that you think she&#39;d enjoy. <br/>

It involves learning gradually and from real-world sources.<br/>
<br/>
For you to learn about it you, too, need to so some of your own  <br/>
exploring and not ask us everything you think of.<br/>
<br/>
You should read some John Holt before you post much more.  There&#39;s  <br/>
enough online to give you an idea--poke around here:<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She has convinced us she will care for them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You shouldn&#39;t expect her to. It will set her up to fail and it will  <br/>
be a tension that will seep into the atmosphere of your home. You  <br/>
will look at your daughter as less than perfect. She will feel less  <br/>
than perfect. The tension will seep into her appreciation of the  <br/>
rabbits and she&#39;ll feel even less like taking care of them.<br/>
<br/>
Parents should expect to take care of animals. Parents should do it  <br/>
joyfully. It will model setting aside our own needs to care for  <br/>
someone else who is dependent on us. And by doing it joyfully, when  <br/>
you invite her along to do it with you, she&#39;ll not only be more  <br/>
willing, she&#39;ll have pleasant associations with caring for her animals.<br/>
<br/>
(It is, of course, easy to say &quot;Do it joyfully&quot;! It takes a lot of  <br/>
work and mental shifting of gears to work into that mind set. And  <br/>
it&#39;s easy to slip out of it, and grumble and resent it. That&#39;s an  <br/>
indication of not filling yourself up enough and feeling like the  <br/>
things you (and others) do for you are in short supply and you need  <br/>
to take from others joy to fill your own joy. It&#39;s hard work to find  <br/>
ways to get off of that path and ways to avoid stepping back on it  <br/>
but it&#39;s well worth it. And people here can help with things that  <br/>
have worked for them.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; do unschooler parents request a book report or research<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you wanted a new mixer, how would you feel if your husband told  <br/>
you to research it and write up a report for him?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, do, research! But do it because it&#39;s a good idea. Just as you  <br/>
might sit down with an issue of Consumer Reports to look over their  <br/>
article on mixers, do some research yourself and do it in a way that  <br/>
your daughter would enjoy doing it with you. Get adult books and  <br/>
child level books and look through them together. Share what you&#39;re  <br/>
learning. Don&#39;t turn it into something that&#39;s good for her to do.  <br/>
She&#39;ll feel that. Do it because it&#39;s honestly a good idea for *you*  <br/>
to know more about an animal *you&#39;re* going to be responsible for.<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;ll even hand you a bit of research: My daughter and I volunteer at  <br/>
a shelter and we&#39;ve seen maybe a dozen rabbits come through there. (I  <br/>
honestly don&#39;t see the point of rabbits but that&#39;s beside the  <br/>
point ;-) Some of them are very very messy and will poop and pee  <br/>
wherever they happen to be: food, bedding, etc. Some of them are  <br/>
quite clean and confine it *mostly* to their litter box. We&#39;ve had  <br/>
rabbits come in from the same home that were night and day in  <br/>
cleanliness so part may be training but part may be personality. (And  <br/>
part is just the nature of rabbits. They, um, recycle their waste to  <br/>
have another go at extracting the nutrients ;-) Personally I&#39;d get a  <br/>
shelter animal so you can see its habits and personality but I know  <br/>
that would be hard to do with a child who wants one right now. I  <br/>
think a reputable breeder is the next best source rather than pet  <br/>
stores or newspapers. They would be a good source for information too.)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Say you had a gardening business and you had an opening for an  <br/>
apprentice job. Would you feel better about hiring a kid who aces  <br/>
math and spelling and history tests or a kid who has been playing  <br/>
with and messing about with and reading about and exploring plants  <br/>
since she was old enough to dig in the dirt?<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is like looking back on your life and seeing all the  <br/>
things you enjoyed doing in the past that lead you to where you are  <br/>
and then cutting out all the stuff that was done &quot;just because&quot; that  <br/>
led no where.<br/>
<br/>
Because learning in school (and through schoolish ways) is so hard,  <br/>
we fear that learning what we need is hard. But it isn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Because learning in school is often boring, we fear that kids will  <br/>
avoid great huge chunks of stuff they need to know because it&#39;s  <br/>
boring (and therefore hard to learn). But it isn&#39;t. All of life is  <br/>
potentially fascinating until it gets tainted by being put in  <br/>
textbooks and being made to learn it. (Not everyone will be  <br/>
interested in everything. But everyone will want to know more about  <br/>
what connects to and helps them explore their interests.)<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is how your daughter learned to speak. Think about that  <br/>
for a bit. We take the amazing process of learning to speak our  <br/>
native language for granted because all kids do it effortlessly. But  <br/>
it&#39;s truly astounding. Kids start with *nothing*. They have no  <br/>
concept of language but they pull themselves up by their bootstraps  <br/>
and acquire proficiency in just a few short years. And they do it  <br/>
without even trying! They aren&#39;t actively trying to learn how to  <br/>
speak. They&#39;re living life, using language as a tool to get what they  <br/>
want, and they get better at speaking *as a side effect* of living life.<br/>
<br/>
Astounding.<br/>
<br/>
But think about how hard it is when learning a language is turned  <br/>
into a school process, like Spanish or French: taken out of context,  <br/>
put in textbooks, led through unwillingly step by incremental step.  <br/>
How much of the foreign language you took in school do you remember?  <br/>
Is it because you didn&#39;t apply yourself? (It&#39;s the message most of us  <br/>
heard.) Or is it because the process is alien to the way we naturally  <br/>
learn that it&#39;s nearly impossible to *make* someone learn that way?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, some kids *do* learn through school. It&#39;s because 1) they are  <br/>
already interested in the subject and 2) learning through reading  <br/>
matches their learning style. I was good in math in school, not  <br/>
because I was a good student who applied herself but because I liked  <br/>
puzzles. It was just inherent in my nature. I was really bad in  <br/>
history in school because it was a lot of boring people doing boring  <br/>
things. Odd thing, though, I liked history. I like historical movies  <br/>
and novels. But school tainted history for me for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
If someone had judged what I would do if I were unschooling by what I  <br/>
did in school, they&#39;d be certain I&#39;d never do history on my own. The  <br/>
obvious conclusion is that I needed to be made to study history. But  <br/>
that would be wrong. It isn&#39;t accurate to judge kids by the behavior  <br/>
of schooled kids. School hugely mucks up kids&#39; natural behavior.  <br/>
Schooled kids *don&#39;t* behave like kids.<br/>
<br/>
What I needed was the freedom to explore the fun parts of history and  <br/>
in the process -- *as a side effect* -- I would have picked up a  <br/>
whole lot more about the big picture they tried to ram down our  <br/>
throats in school. *And* I would remember it. *And* I wouldn&#39;t have  <br/>
the taint of being force fed it attached to it (that makes it a  <br/>
relief to forget the facts.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2033553344"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;She has convinced us she will care for them.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Even though I agree with Sandra that you will be best served with all of<br/>
these questions by spending lots of time reading through the links, they<br/>
really do have the answers you are looking for and people have done an<br/>
enormous amount of work to put them there, I did want to respond to two<br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
Bringing animals into the home can be a multi-faceted, fabulous experience<br/>
for the whole family. However, it is the parent&#39;s commitment, NOT the<br/>
child&#39;s commitment, to make sure the animals are well-cared for, and it&#39;s<br/>
the parent&#39;s commitment to do it happily (at least most of the time :o).<br/>
<br/>
Our dd wanted a horse. She had been going to horse camp and reading about<br/>
horses and watching horse movies for a long time. When we figured out how to<br/>
afford a horse (which was a pretty darn expensive endeavor for us), dh and I<br/>
did a bunch of research with dd around for most of it (and she was<br/>
interested in much of it, and when she wasn&#39;t she was usually nearby and<br/>
still catching parts of our conversations and enlightenments) and we visited<br/>
horses for sale and eventually bought one and boarded it down the street<br/>
from our house. Dd, dh and I went there every morning at 6:30 for feeding,<br/>
watering, grooming and stall-cleaning. She took riding lessons three times a<br/>
week. We were there many times outside of those times each week. We all<br/>
learned to ride and had so much fun, and put out a whole lot of work! It was<br/>
a GREAT experience for us...the three of us had real special times at the<br/>
stables.<br/>
<br/>
And then she lost interest. Dh and I went to do the work when she didn&#39;t<br/>
want to, or when she wanted to sleep in. This happened more and more, and at<br/>
the same time our financial situation changed and the costs were getting<br/>
harder to handle. Wonderfully for us, the boarding facility owner saw what<br/>
was happening. She offered to buy Sugar. We talked to dd about this, and she<br/>
was glad that our loving neighbor wanted to continue to care for Sugar, and<br/>
that she would be right down the street still. So we sold her.<br/>
<br/>
This adventure was not one that I chose, and frankly, I did have to work up<br/>
the joy to do it. But when I did, *I* was blessed at the time we had<br/>
together.<br/>
<br/>
It would have been easy to get mad at dd&#39;s change in direction. It would<br/>
have been easy to make her feel bad about it...about stopping the horse<br/>
care, about her losing her interest after we had put a lot of work and money<br/>
and love into Sugar.<br/>
<br/>
But why would we do that? She was learning about something she was<br/>
interested in, and now she knows exactly what horse ownership means, and<br/>
what it takes. That is some mighty hefty learning! Something she would<br/>
never, no mater how many books she read or how many classes she took, have<br/>
truly learned otherwise. And we continue to have fond memories (the neighbor<br/>
and Sugar have since moved) and reflections of that time.<br/>
<br/>
A rabbit is a much less expensive and work-related animal (we&#39;ve had a few),<br/>
so if you get a rabbit...go for it! Research it, find out what it takes to<br/>
own a bunny (she may lose interest during the research...that&#39;s happened to<br/>
us many times). Know that you will be showing how to love and happily care<br/>
for an animal. She will definitely pick up on that. We have two dogs and<br/>
four cats, and have had so many different kinds of animals over the years<br/>
that I can&#39;t even count...my kids are great with animals and I do think that<br/>
part of that was seeing their parents be happy with them.<br/>
<br/>
And one more thing...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;(It is, of course, easy to say &quot;Do it joyfully&quot;! It takes a lot of<br/>
&gt;&gt;work and mental shifting of gears to work into that mind set.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I also wanted to suggest that it doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be hard to<br/>
shift from stressed to joy. They really are just two feelings, and it is<br/>
possible to choose. If you can come up with some ways to know that you need<br/>
to shift in a moment...it only needs to take a moment to go from irritated<br/>
to joy. Maybe you recognize a tone of voice you use...when you hear it,<br/>
quick, stop! Take a deep breath in and blow out the irritation. Take another<br/>
breath in and make it full of joy. Sometimes I shake my body and jump around<br/>
for a minute...shaking off the negativity. The goal is joy in every moment.<br/>
And while I&#39;m certainly not there every moment, I do know that I can choose<br/>
it in every single moment.<br/>
