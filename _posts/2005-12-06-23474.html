Hi there,<br/>
 <br/>
I am SAM, an Iraqi refugee living in Lebanon at the moment; I have spent the last 10 years of my life as a refugee registered with the UNHCR in Beirut. The last 4 years, I have spent as an activist for peace and human rights (especially refugees and asylum seekers) on the Internet; I&#39;m also books author and ebooks publisher. I have launched many campaigns to improve our situation as refugees in Lebanon and hopefully bring more understanding to our problems worldwide. I helped make many changes and improvements at the UNHCR office in Beirut; I used the Internet as the field for my activities (you can read more about that in my free ebook &#39;MY CAMPAIGNS&#39;). All my ebooks are free and could be download from my sites.<br/>
 <br/>
This is my newest campaign, it&#39;s about the illegal and humiliating actions of the UNHCR, who using photos of refugees as banners and human-buttons to collect money. This is an abuse of the dignity and humanity of the refugees and must stop immediately and a clear public apology present by The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. My friends, I am talking about the pictures you can see here: <br/>

For more info about UNHCR and life of refugees you can read my free ebooks. I invite you as fellow humans and members of the world community to support my campaign by reading my article on my site and see the human-buttons. The campaign is to support and improve the UNHCR <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unhcr.ch">http://www.unhcr.ch</a> especially after the last scandals in the UN and UNHCR, just for example: <br/>
 <br/>
The refugees allege that UNHCR staff is selling most of the food items they are supposed to be supplied.<br/>
&quot;They aren&#39;t supplying sufficient food to us because they sell most of the food items,&quot; they allege: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://allafrica.com/stories/200503140214.html">http://allafrica.com/stories/200503140214.html</a><br/>

I&#39;ll go and put the spam filter back on.  Bummer.  It means new  <br/>
members will have to be individually removed from moderation, but  <br/>
it&#39;s better than subjecting the list to all manner of stuff.<br/>
