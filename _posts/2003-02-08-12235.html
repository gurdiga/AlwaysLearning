&gt; You could just inform your x-mil that in MA, every district has<br/>
&gt; different rules.  (That should undercut her phony expertise.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>MA is bizarre, and yes, within the limits of court decisions, each district <br/>
makes its own policy. Unfortunately, many of the superintendents don&#39;t know <br/>
what those limits are. Peabody, where this guy is superintendent has another <br/>
twist on it-- you have to report to the principal of the school your kid <br/>
would have gone, and they know even less, AND they frankly have other stuff <br/>
to do. <br/>

We live in Salem, which is actually very good. <br/>

Oh, Alice&#39;s evil bitchiness has never actually been affected in any way with <br/>
the facts.<br/>

&gt; Alice is an evil bitch.**<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is a perfect illustration of Sandra&#39;s concept that if a parent<br/>
&gt; defines success for their child very narrowly, then their children will<br/>
&gt; most likely fail to meet their standards.  So, let&#39;s all of us define<br/>
&gt; success broadly.<br/>
