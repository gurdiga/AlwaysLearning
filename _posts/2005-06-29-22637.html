<div id="ygrps-yiv-1108397694">Well I talked to my kids about the reading program at the library that <br/>
I outlined here earlier: a prize for every 4 hours read.  My 8 year <br/>
old autistic son Thomas could not grasp the concept of this program, <br/>
marking time in a notebook and getting prizes for so much accumulated <br/>
time, no matter how many times and in how many ways I tried to explain <br/>
it.  So I told him I would show him when we got to the library.  Once <br/>
he had the booklet in his hand and I explained it again as I used the <br/>
booklet for illustration he seemed to get the idea.  He has trouble <br/>
with abstracts, and also with the grasping of the passage of time.  We <br/>
read for ten minutes and he asks me if it&#39;s been 4 hours yet.  Having <br/>
an analog clock to look at helps him a lot, with hands moving around <br/>
in different places.  Digital doesn&#39;t help much since he&#39;s dyslexic <br/>
and the numbers are just confusing.<br/>
<br/>
He is only interested in getting the prizes and doesn&#39;t seem to care <br/>
what the motivations are of the library for wanting him to read, <br/>
doesn&#39;t ask, doesn&#39;t wonder.  I just told him that the library is all <br/>
about books and it makes them happy when kids read, so they like to <br/>
encourage it  lol.  <br/>
<br/>
So we got him the little booklet to track his reading time when we <br/>
went to the library this afternoon and he&#39;s been drawing pictures or <br/>
putting stickers into the little squares in the book that represent <br/>
each half hour being read to or looking at books himself.  He&#39;s not a <br/>
delayed gratification kind of kid and has this idea that a prize will <br/>
materialize when he reches the 4 hour mark, or that we can go back to <br/>
the library instantly tonight and get it.  In fact he wanted to sit in <br/>
the truck and read for 4 hours and then go back in a get a prize, not <br/>
understanding how long 4 hours really is.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading to him all afternoon and evening now, as time <br/>
between meals prep and so forth permitted, and he&#39;s got about 3 hours <br/>
marked off.  This really is not that out of the ordinary around here <br/>
though, as he often hounds me to read to him until my voice gives <br/>
out.  I keep warning him that the prizes might not be too spectacular <br/>
and he needs to be prepared in case they are not what he&#39;s hoping.  I <br/>
can see a huge tantrum if he&#39;s hoping for and visualizing something <br/>
specific and the prize is disappointing to him.  Autistics don&#39;t shift <br/>
thought gears easily.  <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile his 7 year old brother amicably (as usual) said Yeah!  he <br/>
wanted to try it out as well, since his brother is doing it, and got <br/>
his own booklet.  I&#39;ve marked his time off for him because he doesn&#39;t <br/>
seem to care much, and I know from experience with him that whatever <br/>
they give him, paper bookmark, eraser, pencil, plastic ring, whatever <br/>
their prizes are, he will be happy as a clam and say &quot;Ooooo, thanks!&quot;  <br/>
lol  He&#39;s a pretty easy kid.  He may not care to continue after the <br/>
first prize if he doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s really cool though, just be happy <br/>
with what he got and say &quot;no thanks&quot; to marking off any more time in <br/>
the booklet.  I doubt he will read any longer than he normally does <br/>
either way.  <br/>
<br/>
I find myself wondering if this stuff actually works on other kids, <br/>
because aside from being excited about prizes and keeping track of <br/>
reading time it seems to be business as usual around here with books.  <br/>
I guess schooled kids often avoid schooly stuff and shun reading <br/>
during their summer of freedom and the powers that be are trying to <br/>
counteract that?  Mine have never been in a school, or preschool, or <br/>
daycare, so it&#39;s hard for me to visualize what it&#39;s like in homes <br/>
where there is another reality.<br/>

previously--We checked out the one at our Bellingham,<br/>
WA library, and it is lovely!  They encourage &quot;20<br/>
minutes of reading a day&quot;, but that is it.  Whenever<br/>
you come in, they have you write your name on a dragon<br/>
scale, no matter how much you&#39;ve read, and all the<br/>
kids try to fill up the dragon with scales...then at<br/>
the end you get to meet the mayor.  No prizes!  I am<br/>
so pleased with it!  Much better than all the prizes<br/>
at other libraries we&#39;ve been to!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The idea that I had is that this gives the family (ie. parents) something<br/>
to continue during summer, like homework.  That way the &quot;school routine&quot;<br/>
isn&#39;t broken too much, the kids won&#39;t have tooo much Summer freedom, and<br/>
maybe it won&#39;t be so hard (on the parents!) to transition back in the Fall.<br/>
Don&#39;t know though, I can only imagine....<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, readers and non get to meet the mayor.  Everyone<br/>
is encouraged to meet the mayor at the end.  And<br/>
non-readers  are encouraged to put their names up<br/>
whenever they come to the library as well.  It is the<br/>
least &quot;reading&quot; reading program I&#39;ve seen!<br/>

It seems to me that you had to talk him into it a little.  Could you  have <br/>
just dropped it altogether at some point in the conversation and would he  have <br/>
been okay with that?  Is this something he could easily forget before  you go <br/>
to the library?  I&#39;m feeling sorry for him already, thinking that  the prize <br/>
might be built up in his mind, and after all the conversation you had  to have <br/>
to get him to understand.  I&#39;m wondering if it&#39;s too late to let it  go and <br/>
avoid that possible tantrum situation?  <br/>
 <br/>
If it&#39;s not too late to just drop it and move on to something else with  him, <br/>
but the library visit will remind him of the prize--I&#39;d fill in his 4  hours, <br/>
probably 8 or 12, just so he can avoid a tantrum.  Maybe 2  or 3 prizes will <br/>
make up for one prize not being a new car.  ;)  He&#39;s  read 8 or 12 hours <br/>
already in the last month if he begs you to read until you  lose your voice.  <br/>
 <br/>
I hope it works out to a peaceful end with no disappointment.<br/>

&quot;Do you want to join?&quot; She shrugged and said sure, so we got all the<br/>

dragon scales or place to write their names up and make a big deal of <br/>
them either (which Thomas would like.)<br/>
