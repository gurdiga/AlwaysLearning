Wow, my boys (8 and 10) would LOVE to be able to join in on something like this. We&#39;ve got a little local server running, but unfortunately it doesn&#39;t have enough capacity to be able to go public.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re located in Australia, but they keep some very flexible hours, so I don&#39;t see time zones being too much of a problem.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks heaps for this - I look forward to hearing when it is up and running.<br/>

She and my husband have a server that they play on together, but he deployed a few weeks ago and doesn&#39;t have much time to be online from where he is. I bet she would love a chance to play with some other kids. <br/>
