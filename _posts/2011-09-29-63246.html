<div id="ygrps-yiv-644641878">A fellow homeschooling dad is helping to co-produce this film. Please share among other homeschoolers!! Very exciting!!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m co-producing the first full-length feature film on homeschooling with a senior editor for Lucas Films and could use your support!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s our fundraising campaign: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.indiegogo.com/Class-Dismissed-Fund">http://www.indiegogo.com/Class-Dismissed-Fund</a> <br/>
<br/>
The entire crew is composed of homeschool parents who work in the film industry who want to raise the public awareness of homeschooling & dispel many of the myths that surround homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
For more background on the film, visit <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.homeschoolfilm.com/">http://www.homeschoolfilm.com/</a>  <br/>
<br/>
Any financial or promotional support (Facebook, other homeschool groups, etc) you could offer would be greatly appreciated.</div>
