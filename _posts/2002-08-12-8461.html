<div id="ygrps-yiv-1850548334">Hello!  I&#39;m just to happy to live!  I&#39;ve discovered a way to send spam to<br/>
the whole world while staying home with my spam eating children...<br/>
<br/>
Dang, don&#39;t you wish these folks would get a hobby?<br/>
<br/>
We know you&#39;re on top of it Pam, probably polishing up the brass knuckles<br/>
right now.<br/>
Good work!<br/>
<br/>
Deb L, wondering if there&#39;s legit stay at home money in mail order brass<br/>
knuckles...OOH  packaged like spam... packaged in spam?  Made of spam?</div>
