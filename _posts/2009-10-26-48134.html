<div id="ygrps-yiv-1576298065">Question:  How long have you been unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
Answer:  since birth!  but my kids did go to an alternative school  <br/>
(named it) for a few years - it is child led and very<br/>
unschooly<br/>
they are homeschooling again this year!<br/>
<br/>
---------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Ah...  It must seem I&#39;m just being picky, but I don&#39;t say &quot;since  <br/>
birth,&quot; even though Holly was born after Kirby was unschooling at the  <br/>
age of five.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that in the absence of certification, at least there  <br/>
should be something to go by.<br/>
<br/>
Someone who has conscientiously unschooled for a whole year might be a  <br/>
better advisor than someone who&#39;s unschooled  &quot;since birth.&quot;<br/>
