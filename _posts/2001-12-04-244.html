<div id="ygrps-yiv-77691453">&lt;&lt; Thanks for the clarification. I asked because I sensed<br/>
humor yet I often view humor as negative rather than<br/>
positive/still valid. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s funny.<br/>
<br/>
Not humorous funny, but irony-funny.<br/>
<br/>
At our house, to fail to use humor means you are angry or sad.<br/>
Humor infuses all of our homeschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
But meanness, that&#39;s another thing.  I wasn&#39;t being mean.<br/>
<br/>
Mean humor, insults and sarcasm are rare at our house.  The light sarcasm <br/>
that&#39;s more in the line of puns or tongue-in-cheek is done, but not joking at <br/>
someone else&#39;s expense.<br/>
<br/>
If someone is sad or worried or in no joking mood, we&#39;ll be serious with that <br/>
person, but the default communications-set involves humor and music.<br/>
<br/>
