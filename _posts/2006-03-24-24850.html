She interviewed me for a LONG, long time, and said she&#39;d tell me when  <br/>
the article came out.  I just came across a reference to it on the  <br/>
blog of someone I don&#39;t know, looking for something else. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s an okay article.  As usual, someone deeply ignorant of  <br/>
unschooling was quoted in opposition of it.  It seems inevitable.<br/>
Maybe only only the ignorant are opposed.<br/>

... it would be hard for them to deny that their approach can lead to the acquisition of idiosyncratic skills. When she went off to her freshman year in college, Laurie Chancey was already a gifted computer programmer -- but struggled to get through a class in remedial math.=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Why do colleges even *have* remedial math courses?  They have them for the many students who come out of K-12 without the math skills considered necessary to succeed in college - not for the few unschoolers with idiosyncratic skills.<br/>

in this way:  I&#39;m kinda making up the numbers for the illustration  <br/>
because I&#39;m not positive of them, or maybe I did guess them right.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
97<br/>
98<br/>
99<br/>
100<br/>
121   121 was the lowest college-credit math class.<br/>
<br/>
The other four were four levels of remediation.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby, with nary a math lesson, tested into the 99.<br/>
NOT the first two, which filled up with high school graduates or high  <br/>
school dropouts.  By the time one is allowed to drop out, he should  <br/>
have had fifteen years of math instruction, 55 minutes a day, 180  <br/>
days a year.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby had zero, but had learned his math from games, puzzles, using  <br/>
money in real ways (like calculating tips and his 30% discount at the  <br/>
gaming shop), working, etc.<br/>
<br/>
He finished second in that class, and had the highest final test score.<br/>
