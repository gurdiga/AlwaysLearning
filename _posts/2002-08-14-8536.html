&gt; 10:20 Holly was watching Simpson&#39;s and came and asked me to make her some <br/>
&gt; spinach.  I said okay and she said I was the nicest mom in the world.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; All we had was frozen and she&#39;s used to fresh.<br/>
&gt; She&#39;s never tasted canned.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When it was nearly ready she was talking to me about how many minutes or <br/>
&gt; whatever, and I told her wait, I wasn&#39;t listening.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She said &quot;You shouldn&#39;t ignore me, mom, because that will ruin my life and <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll end up being mean to my kids.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She&#39;s sharing her spinach with me now.  It&#39;s good!<br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh Sandra.....that is so cute. I couldn&#39;t help but smile... Kids can be so <br/>
honest and truthful about their thoughts a feelings.<br/>
<br/>
To Holly:<br/>
Thank you..... Thank-you because I don&#39;t want to repeat what was done to me <br/>
and sometimes you do repeat those cycles.... Thank-you.....and a big hug!<br/>
<br/>
To the group;<br/>
<br/>
My kids, I know  may feel the same way sometimes when I ignore them and I <br/>
just said to myself wait....I&#39;m repeating what I hated....<br/>
It reminded me of how my mom treated me her my and how hurt and painful my <br/>
childhood my entire childhood was because she was wrapped up into herself <br/>
because she was extremely materialistic and ignored me and I had to raise <br/>
myself. The thing is..she only had me, no other children and she still didn&#39;t <br/>
have the time. Her important things were having the perfect  brand new house <br/>
( often trading up for a bigger & better one), the nic naks, the 3 cars, and <br/>
bragging rights.....<br/>
Well, she admits that now......only because she no longer have those <br/>
luxuries.......<br/>
<br/>
 Back then, she did understand why I was so distant as a teenager and didn&#39;t <br/>
come to her and talk with her about things ,was a loner and kept myself busy <br/>
with so many activities at school. I honestly didn&#39;t find the need to be <br/>
home......<br/>
