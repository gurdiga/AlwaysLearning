<div id="ygrps-yiv-1327481223">&quot;You really shouldn&#39;t say &#39;I love you&#39; unless you mean it. But if you  <br/>
mean it, you should say it a lot. People forget. When someone loves  <br/>
you, the way they say your name is different. You just know that your  <br/>
name is safe in their mouth.&quot; ~Megan Jo Eberhart, 5 years old.<br/>

That&#39;s from the blog of Chrisi Lewis, an unschooling mom in Georgia.   <br/>
She played my lyrics game and I followed her links and found that.   <br/>
Wow.    &quot;When someone loves you, the way they say your name is  <br/>
different. You just know that your name is safe in their mouth.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think now I know how to tell whether I really love someone and am  <br/>
showing it.  If a name is safe in my mouth, that&#39;s love.  When I say  <br/>
something bad about someone I love, I&#39;m not doing the best I can do.   <br/>
When I yell their name in frustration, or do anything other than  <br/>
speak it lovingly, that&#39;s a sign to make better choices.<br/>
<br/>
Chrisi&#39;s blog doesn&#39;t allow comments, so I&#39;m commenting here, and I  <br/>
thought the thoughts of Megan Jo Eberhart, five years old, might help  <br/>
make some other people&#39;s children&#39;s lives happier today.<br/>
