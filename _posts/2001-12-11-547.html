<div id="ygrps-yiv-669600616">I would love to hear about people&#39;s traditions as we approach holidays.  Here <br/>
is my favorite of ours:<br/>
<br/>
Each Christmas, we each make each family member a made-present. It&#39;s become a <br/>
tradition for Beth to make Julian a nightshirt. (She asked him the other day <br/>
if, at twelve, he&#39;d prefer something different. He gave her a HORRIFIED <br/>
look!) We open these gifts on Christmas eve, while eating cookies and <br/>
drinking cocoa, after coming back from the Christmas eve service at church.  <br/>
(I work for a Unitarian Universalist church as Director of Religious <br/>
Education, so I&#39;m usually involved in the service itself.)<br/>

Vancouver, and I&#39;m not sure what Pat is near Ottawa, but something like that.<br/>
