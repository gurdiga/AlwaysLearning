<div id="ygrps-yiv-1870204306">I had to come home for something I forgot. I haven&#39;t checked, but Melinda <br/>
said that she had written here to let everyone know of Sandra&#39;s leg. I&#39;ll <br/>
reiterate:<br/>
<br/>
Sandra fell Friday afternoon at 4:00 on her way to her &quot;Moving  A Puddle&quot; <br/>
keynote speach and fell (at a puddle! ) and broke both her tibia and fibula <br/>
right above her right ankle. She had sugery today at noon. She&#39;s doing fine <br/>
and they&#39;ll probably release her tomorrow morning.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve moved the schedule around, and other speakers have taken her spots <br/>
leaving a space (that&#39;s fillable, if we need to) for her at 10:00 tomorrow. <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s mostly miserable, I think, that she&#39;s letting me down and that so many <br/>
folks came from SOOO far away to see her speak---and she&#39;s letting them down. <br/>
Mostly everyone is just plain worried about her. She&#39;s seeing some of the <br/>
regular posters at her hospital room--Ren and Tuck and Karin, and Mary <br/>
(Zenmomma), and Priss---among others have been up to see her to cheer her up.<br/>
<br/>
Things are going well, despite the major trauma. Everyone has picked up the <br/>
slack.Overall the conference is going quite well. I&#39;m happy. But this has <br/>
been the major trauma.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;ll be waiting to hear from all of you!<br/>
<br/>
