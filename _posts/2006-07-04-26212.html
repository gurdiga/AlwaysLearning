<div id="ygrps-yiv-1088460499">Activity comes and goes, and this is probably the quietest season for  <br/>
lists, but because we do (as usual) have new members, I wanted to  <br/>
provide a link to this:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/johnholt">http://sandradodd.com/johnholt</a><br/>
<br/>
and to let those who&#39;ve seen it already know that there is some news  <br/>
there.  HEM plans to put old issues of Growing Without Schooling online.<br/>
<br/>
At this point, there are some things that are way more current,  <br/>
lively and colorful than Growing Without Schooling (GWS), but  <br/>
still... it&#39;s nice to see some of the early enthusiasm AND to have it  <br/>
as a contrast to the ease of information these days.<br/>
<br/>
I have a new link here, too<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/help">http://sandradodd.com/help</a><br/>
in the lower leftâ€”links to the Blog Carnival topic for last month,  <br/>
and information on how to get in on the next one.  Following some of  <br/>
those links might lead you to unschooling sites you&#39;ve never seen.<br/>
<br/>
Knowledge is power and information is wealth!  Ideas fall somewhere  <br/>
on that mysterious scale of priceless to worthless, depending how  <br/>
valuable the idea is to you yourself.  But there are a lot of ideas  <br/>
to be had through those two links.<br/>
