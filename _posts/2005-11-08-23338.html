<div id="ygrps-yiv-1328085365">Hi all.  I have not posted in a while.  Lately I have<br/>
been really involved in both local/in person and<br/>
online support and activities for parents with special<br/>
needs kids, particularly those homeschooling special<br/>
needs kids.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found an interesting and somewhat disturbing<br/>
phenomenon to be pretty common among these groups. <br/>
There seem to be a good number of rabid self described<br/>
&quot;unschoolers&quot; out there who are not only scaring peole<br/>
away and turning people off to unschooling, but also<br/>
in my opinion giving us unschoolers, and unschooling<br/>
in general, a bad name.  It&#39;s possible that we&#39;re<br/>
talking about the zeal of the &quot;newly converted&quot; with<br/>
these people (mostly women) who in their fervor go<br/>
somewhat overboard.  But I think there is also an<br/>
element of misunderstanding exactly what unschooling<br/>
is.  I thought I would run this idea by this group and<br/>
see what your thoughts and experiences are.<br/>
<br/>
The overwhelmingly prevalent attitude I&#39;ve run into<br/>
among other homeschoolers is to mistakenly believe<br/>
that unschoolers &quot;can&#39;t&quot; use books, textbooks,<br/>
curriculums, classes, and so forth.  That&#39;s not all<br/>
that surprising, that other homeschoolers don&#39;t really<br/>
&quot;get&quot; unschooling.  But what has surprised me is how<br/>
many people who call themselves unschoolers don&#39;t seem<br/>
to really get it either.  It seems that some folks<br/>
just trade one type of controls for another, not to<br/>
mention the fact that they seem to be rather<br/>
sanctimonious and overbearing towards others who don&#39;t<br/>
unschool.<br/>
<br/>
Now, it&#39;s my understanding of unschooling that<br/>
anything you (you as the learner) want, need, or<br/>
choose freely to use for your own &quot;education,&quot; or just<br/>
to experience, is just dandy.  I usually explain<br/>
unschooling to others as not a homeschooling style,<br/>
but rather a lifestyle and a basic different view of<br/>
how learning happens and of relationships within a<br/>
family, and having a lot to do with trusting and<br/>
respecting children as people.  I realize this may<br/>
just be related to certain types of personalities, but<br/>
does it seem to you folks that there is a general<br/>
misunderstanding of what unschooling is among<br/>
unschoolers?<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s an interesting question.<br/>
<br/>
If you define &quot;unschoolers&quot; one way, it can&#39;t be the other.<br/>
If all those who &quot;are unschoolers&quot; (among unschoolers)   ARE unschoolers, <br/>
then. . .<br/>
<br/>
Could you rephrase the question? &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Unless that thing is some seriously oppressive schooling.   Because once a <br/>
person submits to the authority and curriculum of another, the unschooling has <br/>
dissipated.   Once a person is admitted to the Swiss boarding school, that&#39;s <br/>
not going to be in the unschooling circle in anyone&#39;s Venn diagram.    <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Under what circumstances do you think an unschooler would use a curriculum?   <br/>
<br/>
Or what do you mean by &quot;use&quot;?   Because I&#39;ve looked at some, checklist style, <br/>
but I didn&#39;t &quot;USE&quot; them as they were probably intended to be &quot;used.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
All these words you&#39;re using... they have these meanings. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=- It seems that some folks<br/>
just trade one type of controls for another,...-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I&#39;ve noticed that.<br/>
Some people become teachers because of the power aspect of it (in part, at <br/>
least), and some moms seem to homeschool because they want that same sort of <br/>
power.<br/>
<br/>
-=-. . . not to mention the fact that they seem to be rather sanctimonious <br/>
and overbearing towards others who don&#39;t unschool.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I try to get around that myself by staying well away from those who don&#39;t <br/>
unschool, because the alternately sadden me and piss me off.   And when they some <br/>
to me, it seems too often to be to get some kind of blessing or stamp of <br/>
approval on some dumbass thing they want to do, and they want me (and probably <br/>
half a dozen or a hundred others) to say &quot;Good idea!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It seems like   yesterday (I think it was Sunday) that someone wrote to try <br/>
to get me to agree that she could unschool even though the worked fulltime at <br/>
least until the child was schoolage, because she had great daycare options, and <br/>
she had a strong work ethic (meaning, I took it, that I was a slouch to stay <br/>
home and might not understand &quot;work ethic&quot;).    <br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah... didn&#39;t mention she didn&#39;t have any children, but thought she might <br/>
possibly be one week pregnant.<br/>
<br/>
When I suggested she might wait and see how her child handled being with <br/>
others before deciding she got all pissed off.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of people don&#39;t understand lots of things.<br/>

rephrase myself, but I&#39;ll try.  Obviously not everyone who says they <br/>
are an unschooler is really an unschooler.  Unschooling does <br/>
actually have perameters and a definition, it has boundaries of what <br/>
it is and what it is not.  Merely saying &quot;I am an unschooler&quot; does <br/>
not then make you one.  If that were so, lists like this would be <br/>
superfluous wouldn&#39;t they?  I certainly have known more than one <br/>
person who said they were unschoolers who were not, who were total <br/>
control freaks in really bizarre ways and so forth.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;Because once a person submits to the authority and curriculum of <br/>
&gt;another, the unschooling has dissipated.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>True, I was thinking more from the non-coerced standpoint, as in why <br/>
would a person freely choose to enter into an opressive setting?  <br/>
But I suppose there are people who would do that, for various <br/>
reasons:  The comfort of familiarity/the known evil, fear of <br/>
autonomy, lack of self confidence, and so on.  It doesn&#39;t really <br/>
count I think if they are going in &quot;undercover&quot; in order to study <br/>
the setting in an &#39;expose&#39; sort of way.  I know there are <br/>
unschoolers who have chosen to try out school.  That doesn&#39;t mean <br/>
they are not unschoolers, because they are still there by choice, <br/>
unlike all the other kids.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Under what circumstances do you think an unschooler would use a <br/>
&gt;curriculum?   <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmmm...well if you have a goal you want to pursue for your own <br/>
reasons and that goal requires following a set of standards or <br/>
fulfilling a set of goals, such as attaining training or <br/>
certification in a certain trade or skill or profession.  As far as <br/>
younger children using curriculum, I could see a curriculum being a <br/>
tool, used in various parts, maybe as an idea starter, or a safety <br/>
net for someone who&#39;s deschooling (like a teen) so that they don&#39;t <br/>
feel so unsupported during that process, or used while in a school <br/>
or class setting they have chosen to be in, or in any number of <br/>
other ways.  I know your kids Sandra have participated on occassion <br/>
in class type things (that summer police academy for one) and I&#39;m <br/>
sure there was a certain &quot;curriculum&quot; of sorts as far as what/when <br/>
and so forth they were supposed to be doing, meeting preset goals <br/>
and so on.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Because I&#39;ve looked at some, checklist style, but I didn&#39;t &quot;USE&quot; <br/>
&gt;them as they were probably intended to be &quot;used.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I suppose it only matters how you use a tool if you want someone&#39;s <br/>
approval of how you are using it.  If you are only using it for <br/>
yourself, for whatever reasons you find it usefull or interesting or <br/>
whatever, which is how an unschooler would appraoch such things I <br/>
would think, than it doesn&#39;t matter how it was &quot;intended to be used&quot; <br/>
does it?  I myself have never used any sort of curriculum but I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t think an unschooler would be &quot;forbidden&quot; (by some <br/>
unschooling ghestapo authority??) to use them.  Ceratinly if you <br/>
choose to participate in a school or class setting you have chosen <br/>
to abide by their curriculum as well in order to participate.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; All these words you&#39;re using... they have these meanings. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Damned pesky things.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;.....some moms seem to homeschool because they want that same sort <br/>
&gt;of power.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah I&#39;ve seen that too much myself.  This West coasty self <br/>
righteousness thing.  It&#39;s not religiously based but is sactimonious <br/>
and &quot;holier-than though&quot; none the less, or maybe the phrase would <br/>
be &quot;More intelligent than though&quot;  :-P  I usually call it &quot;Crunchier <br/>
than though&quot; because it comes along (usually around here) with very <br/>
high flown and controlling ideas about whatever their current this <br/>
week idea of a healthy diet is.  But there are different variations <br/>
on that theme certainly.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I try to get around that myself by staying well away from those <br/>
&gt;who don&#39;t unschool, because the alternately sadden me and piss me <br/>
&gt;off.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s difficult to limit your social pool like that when you have <br/>
multiple challenges, like living very rurally, have special needs <br/>
children, being pagan, being low income.  If you get too picky about <br/>
who you spend any time with, you end up alone all the time, and so <br/>
do your kids.  Still, I try to gravitate towards tolerant minds if I <br/>
can&#39;t find many like minds.  We have to gravitate towards tolerant <br/>
minds with special needs kids anyhow, because the inflexible and <br/>
intolerant are just not possible to be around.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1766967588">Hi Nanci,<br/>
<br/>
Could you give some examples of what you are talking about? You seem to have<br/>
some strong opinions about a generalized group of people, and I don&#39;t have<br/>
much success in knowing how to respond to that. Could you give an example of<br/>
something that happened that bothered you?<br/>

wouldn&#39;t have been an unschooler.   She would&#39;ve been an 8th grader in an <br/>

She would&#39;ve been there by choice and could&#39;ve come home when she wanted to, <br/>

<br/>
But in that case, I didn&#39;t use a curriculum, and Marty didn&#39;t use a <br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s not natural learning.   That&#39;s plain old goal-oriented study.   Yes, <br/>
sometimes unschoolers indulge in that, to complete a project, to get a <br/>
certificate, boyscout rank, whatever.   But too much of that would crowd out <br/>
unschooling.<br/>

-=-I suppose it only matters how you use a tool if you want someone&#39;s<br/>

<br/>
When you suggest that using a curriculum doesn&#39;t negate unschooling, people <br/>
will assume you mean using a curriculum as its authors intended.   If we were <br/>
talking about hand sewing and I said using a sewing machine is okay for hand <br/>
sewing, and you balked, and I said &quot;I only used the sewing machine to prop my <br/>
tapestry frame up against&quot;...    <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
-=-Obviously not everyone who says they<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s the &quot;really&quot; that needs to be qualified.   Each individual&#39;s definition <br/>
will vary.   <br/>
<br/>
-=- Unschooling does actually have perameters and a definition, it has <br/>
boundaries of what<br/>
it is and what it is not.Â -=-<br/>
<br/>
I think so, but if someone else doesn&#39;t agree with my definition and <br/>
parameters, where&#39;s the court of appeals?   <br/>
<br/>
-=-Merely saying &quot;I am an unschooler&quot; does not then make you one.Â -=-<br/>
<br/>
Not one that YOU accept.   Probably not one that *I* accept as an unschooler <br/>
in my own unschooling universe.   But there are others out there who will coo <br/>
and say &quot;you&#39;re SUCH a good unSCHOOler!&quot; and then they&#39;ll feel good.<br/>
<br/>
-=-If that were so, lists like this would be superfluous wouldn&#39;t they?Â -=-<br/>
<br/>
Superfluous suggests there&#39;s some number of lists after which there are too <br/>
many.   There are hundreds of unschooling lists, and maybe a dozen good ones. &lt;<br/>
g&gt;   Four or five REALLY good ones, by my count (which is just my count and <br/>
won&#39;t hold up in that court of appeals heretofore mentioned, unless maybe <br/>
Kelly&#39;s the judge).<br/>
<br/>
This list will quit existing at some point.   Until then, its purpose is to <br/>
give people a place to exchange difficult ideas and to hone their thoughts.   <br/>
It&#39;s a forum for learning more about unschooling by examining passing thoughts <br/>
and ideas and incidents.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I certainly have known more than one<br/>
person who said they were unschoolers who were not, who were total<br/>
control freaks in really bizarre ways and so forth.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve known more than one who said &quot;unschooler&quot; and they weren&#39;t by MY <br/>
standards and definitions.   Their standards were lower and their definitions were <br/>
fuzzier, it seemed.    But it&#39;s not about me or them. It&#39;s about kids.   My kids <br/>
are doing well.   They&#39;re happy and whole, generous and funny.   So what I do <br/>
is share what I did at my house with my kids to &quot;get these results,&quot; at the <br/>
same time allowing for the possibility that some of it is genetics and luck.<br/>
<br/>
Still, examining what helps and hurts if a person wants to create a learning <br/>
and living nest in which children&#39;s growth thrives is a worthy hobby/pursuit, <br/>
I think.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-882461859">As a &quot;newly converted&quot; (also zealous and fervent) mom myself, I would appreciate if you could<br/>
elaborate on how others are giving unschooling a bad name and going overboard, in your opinion.  I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t like to be one of these people.  I never tell anyone that I&#39;m an unschooler, but an<br/>
eclectic homeschooler, because I am trying to get a better grasp on unschooling while deschooling<br/>
myself.  And even when I tell other homeschoolers that we&#39;re relaxed right now because we&#39;re<br/>
trying to undo the bad things that public school has done to the kids, they look at me like I&#39;m<br/>
just lazy or crazy.  So after the first few judgemental vibes I got, I prefer not to talk to<br/>
others about what we&#39;re doing or not doing at home.  (And I&#39;m annoyed when I meet a homeschooler<br/>
for the first time and they ask &quot;What do you use?&quot; [for curriculum], when I don&#39;t.  I have all<br/>
kinds of books - from curriculum to novels to easy readers up to college text, and maps and<br/>
puzzles and games and videos and DVDs and toys, and musical instruments and art supplies and a<br/>
kitchen full of ingredients.  The kids are free to explore any of them.  The conversation stops<br/>
short and the person doesn&#39;t have anything to say.  Then I&#39;m just snubbed.)   The kids are<br/>
starting to blossom after two months of being at home during school hours, and I&#39;m doing my<br/>
research on all different methods of learning, so it isn&#39;t their concern, I suppose.  But maybe<br/>
I&#39;m a parent that, in their opinion, is giving homeschoolers a bad name for not following a<br/>
purchased curriculum.  But, for learning purposes, I would like to know what not to do or say to<br/>
so I don&#39;t go overboard or offend any &quot;true&quot; unschoolers.<br/>

in general, a bad name.  It&#39;s possible that we&#39;re<br/>
talking about the zeal of the &quot;newly converted&quot; with<br/>
these people (mostly women) who in their fervor go<br/>
somewhat overboard.  But I think there is also an<br/>
element of misunderstanding exactly what unschooling<br/>
is.  I thought I would run this idea by this group and<br/>
see what your thoughts and experiences are.<br/>

<br/>
I know this question wasn&#39;t for me, but I just wanted to say that we are ALL<br/>
on our own learning journeys, and I have seen a gambit of unschoolers, and<br/>
each will probably provide a variance of what that means. I think the<br/>
important things are to be honest...to keep an open mind and heart...to be<br/>
willing to make changes, be flexible, and be humble...and to live in the<br/>
moment with your children. But those are my parameters.<br/>
<br/>
Personalities of unschooling parents are as diverse as any other<br/>
cross-section of people. Some people seem stern, or are very organized, or<br/>
are quiet and aloof. Any one of those traits may turn off another<br/>
unschooling parent and make them think they &quot;aren&#39;t doing it right&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
But really, is it for us to judge? We can look at things and decide that it<br/>
certainly wouldn&#39;t work for us, but we really don&#39;t know the deal for them.<br/>
Maybe they are in a VASTLY different and better place than they were a year<br/>
before. And maybe their interpretation of unschooling got them there.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t worry about upsetting unschoolers or giving unschooling a bad<br/>
name. Just be yourself! People will freely give you ideas about changes you<br/>
can make (as you&#39;ve seen :o), hopefully in a spirit of kindness and<br/>
understanding.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Isn&#39;t a gambit more specific than merely tricky or risky?  Doesn&#39;t it <br/>
mean to sacrifice a piece for greater advantage, particularly in the <br/>
opening of a chess game?  (I&#39;m not much of a chess player, but I do <br/>
love dictionaries ;-) We sacrifice school for greater advantage in <br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;A gambit of unschoolers&quot; reminds me of &quot;a murder of crows&quot; or &quot;a <br/>
parliament of owls.&quot;  It could be the new way of referring to us as a <br/>
group -- though it might be misunderstood ;-)))<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Right.   It&#39;s like a freaky parallel universe of the fundamentalist Christian <br/>
homeschoolers who are homeschooling to keep their children from the evil <br/>
influences of secular humanist and other satanic forces, and they are thrilled <br/>
(and brag about it in their magazines) that homeschooling allows them to control <br/>
their children&#39;s knowledge of the world.<br/>
<br/>
Limiting a child isn&#39;t the way unschooling works as far as I&#39;m concerned, but <br/>
consider this shocking thing (I can hardly think about it myself &lt;bwg&gt;):<br/>
<br/>
Some unschoolers don&#39;t have computers at all.   That means they can never <br/>
have read our priceless, flawless definitions of unschooling, AND they can&#39;t tell <br/>
their kids &quot;google it!&quot;   And those who eschew popular culture, their kids <br/>
would not only have no way to get to IMBD.com, they would have no need <br/>
whatsoever.    They could never, ever compare Roxanna to Cyrano de Bergerac.<br/>
<br/>
But those are the extremes.<br/>
<br/>
In the middle ground there are those who say &quot;We&#39;re unschooling, except for <br/>
math and reading.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
&quot;In the AOL days,&quot; meaning when the hotbed of unschooling analysis and <br/>
sharing was in an extensive AOL forum with live chats, message boards, lists, <br/>
newsletters and all, that schism birthed the term &quot;eclectic homeschooling.&quot;    Those <br/>
were the unschoolers who &quot;didn&#39;t really unschool&quot; and so they renamed <br/>
themselves and made lists and websites.<br/>
<br/>
Just as with any protestantism, though, there will continue to be new schisms <br/>
and new subgroupings.    That&#39;s the way freedom goes.   <br/>
<br/>
Anyone&#39;s free to say &quot;I&#39;m unschooling.&quot;   I&#39;m free to consider some to be <br/>
more unschooling than others.   My opinion&#39;s not binding on anyone else.<br/>

are ALL on our own learning journeys, and I have seen a gambit of<br/>
unschoolers, and each will probably provide a variance of what that<br/>
means.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
On these lists we spend a lot of time discussing whether some practice or<br/>
attitude of a parent is going to bring them closer to Unschooling or not.<br/>
The foundation of our thinking seems to me to be about relationships and a<br/>
lifestyle, rather than worrying about &quot;education&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Outside of these lists, for some reason people want to appropriate the label<br/>
to themselves, without the rigor of thought and practice that would be<br/>
encouraged on these lists.<br/>
<br/>
I rarely challenge people in my local group, but I have in the past when<br/>
someone described verbal quizzing (instead of doing the prescribed written<br/>
tests) at the end of her son&#39;s history &quot;lessons&quot; as &quot;taking an Unschooling<br/>
approach&quot;. It was so clearly not Unschooling, by any plausible definition. <br/>
<br/>
I thought I was being really gentle and respectful. A firestorm of &quot;that&#39;s<br/>
just semantics&quot; and &quot;let&#39;s all get along&quot; ensued. I used the old who gets to<br/>
define &quot;Vegan&quot; if not the actual vegans analogy. The last word was had by<br/>
the original poster, who left the discussion with the charming zinger,<br/>
clearly directed at me, the only Unschooler: &quot;Well I have heard that<br/>
Unschooling is neglect. I&#39;ll say no more.&quot; I left it to the group to ask<br/>
then why, in the name of all logic, do you wish to appropriate the name to<br/>
yourself??!!?<br/>
<br/>
Now I refer people to Sandra&#39;s site, Joyce&#39;s site, the Boards and Danielle&#39;s<br/>
blog. I leave it to folks to do their own research.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1848627951">I know someone rather well.  She used to call herself an unschooler<br/>
but has recently settled on eclectic.  Doesn&#39;t matter-- as her<br/>
approach stinks.  Her 9 year daughter hates to read but she insists on<br/>
making her read a certain amount everyday.  The poor child will<br/>
probably hate reading forever.  She used to admire her mother but<br/>
lately she seems a little surly.  I consider her a fellow artist, and<br/>
her brother to be a marvel, and the 5 year old daughter is a peach. <br/>
The mother doesn&#39;t quite see these things the way I do or the<br/>
possibility of relating to children differently.  You see there&#39;s a<br/>
culturally accepted standard for how one talks down to children.  I<br/>
don&#39;t think she relates respectful to herself either.  That&#39;s another<br/>
thing.<br/>
<br/>
True, she isn&#39;t using a curriculum but gives assignments and gave even<br/>
more assignments when she considered herself an unschooler.  She<br/>
spanks and yells--- not a believer in gentle parenting, and while that<br/>
isn&#39;t directly related, it&#39;s a bit antithetical to trusting your kids<br/>
to learn on their own or enriching their environment.  <br/>
<br/>
I listen to her commentary to her kids and watch her behavior with my<br/>
chin firmly picked up off the floor at all times and my opinion kept<br/>
to myself for the most part but it&#39;s oppressive if she could but see<br/>
it.  I, &quot;little miss crunchier than thou&quot; (LUV that) that I am, would<br/>
never be able to influence her by telling her what to do or think or<br/>
feel.  I may not be able to influence her ANYway, and sometimes I<br/>
don&#39;t care.  The least interesting thing coming from me would be the<br/>
true definition of &quot;unschooler.&quot;  <br/>

&gt; Subject: [AlwaysLearning] Misunderstanding Unschooling?...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hi all.  I have not posted in a while.  Lately I have<br/>
&gt; been really involved in both local/in person and<br/>
&gt; online support and activities for parents with special<br/>
&gt; needs kids, particularly those homeschooling special<br/>
&gt; needs kids.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve found an interesting and somewhat disturbing<br/>
&gt; phenomenon to be pretty common among these groups.<br/>
&gt; There seem to be a good number of rabid self described<br/>
&gt; &quot;unschoolers&quot; out there who are not only scaring peole<br/>
&gt; away and turning people off to unschooling, but also<br/>
&gt; in my opinion giving us unschoolers, and unschooling<br/>
&gt; in general, a bad name.  It&#39;s possible that we&#39;re<br/>
&gt; talking about the zeal of the &quot;newly converted&quot; with<br/>
&gt; these people (mostly women) who in their fervor go<br/>
&gt; somewhat overboard.  But I think there is also an<br/>
&gt; element of misunderstanding exactly what unschooling<br/>
&gt; is.  I thought I would run this idea by this group and<br/>
&gt; see what your thoughts and experiences are.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The overwhelmingly prevalent attitude I&#39;ve run into<br/>
&gt; among other homeschoolers is to mistakenly believe<br/>
&gt; that unschoolers &quot;can&#39;t&quot; use books, textbooks,<br/>
&gt; curriculums, classes, and so forth.  That&#39;s not all<br/>
&gt; that surprising, that other homeschoolers don&#39;t really<br/>
&gt; &quot;get&quot; unschooling.  But what has surprised me is how<br/>
&gt; many people who call themselves unschoolers don&#39;t seem<br/>
&gt; to really get it either.  It seems that some folks<br/>
&gt; just trade one type of controls for another, not to<br/>
&gt; mention the fact that they seem to be rather<br/>
&gt; sanctimonious and overbearing towards others who don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; unschool.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now, it&#39;s my understanding of unschooling that<br/>
&gt; anything you (you as the learner) want, need, or<br/>
&gt; choose freely to use for your own &quot;education,&quot; or just<br/>
&gt; to experience, is just dandy.  I usually explain<br/>
&gt; unschooling to others as not a homeschooling style,<br/>
&gt; but rather a lifestyle and a basic different view of<br/>
&gt; how learning happens and of relationships within a<br/>
&gt; family, and having a lot to do with trusting and<br/>
&gt; respecting children as people.  I realize this may<br/>
&gt; just be related to certain types of personalities, but<br/>
&gt; does it seem to you folks that there is a general<br/>
&gt; misunderstanding of what unschooling is among<br/>
&gt; unschoolers?<br/>

book on the desktop, one in my lap.   My gaze is down (good enough for the <br/>
teacher) and peripheral vision helped me turn the page when the others turned it <br/>
(and I would spend a stage-moment looking with interest at the photos and <br/>
section headings, in case she was looking--I&#39;d always already seen the photos and <br/>
read the book anyway, but I would pretend it was new an interesting for a <br/>
couple of seconds, and then go back to my &quot;real&quot; book).   <br/>
<br/>
In 8th grade (I was 13, for the benefit of british-system readers), I made a <br/>
deal with myself NOT to read ahead in my books.   I thought maybe it would <br/>
make school more interesting, and my participation more &quot;fair&quot; (for the other <br/>
kids? for me?).    It was hard to maintain, as I sometimes took the books home <br/>
for homework (NOT OFTEN, though, because I could finish it there or after school <br/>
before my bus came, as I was on a second route).    I didn&#39;t make it all <br/>
year.   Sometimes a reader just gots t&#39;read.    The geography book was the one <br/>
that was really hard not to read ahead in.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2116146480">I had a teacher in college who would catch me reading ahead and deliberately ask me questions<br/>
during his lecture.  I wasn&#39;t quite as sneaky as you.  I think I shocked him when I could read and<br/>
pay attention to the lecture or discussion and answer the question with at least modicum of<br/>
understanding, all the while reading about something entirely off-topic.  Amusing...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I would always draw in class.  If you are writing, you must be taking<br/>
notes, which I also did.  If we were reading as a class, I would read<br/>
ahead, and I was usually good at finding my place when I was called to<br/>
read. Other than homework, I couldn&#39;t be bothered to read the text<br/>
books outside of school.  However, I&#39;ve always been an avid reader. <br/>
I&#39;d happily read ahead in class, but never outside of school.  At home<br/>
it was all Louis L&#39;Amour and Hardy Boys.  I think I learned more from<br/>
Louis L&#39;Amour than I did from school.<br/>
This story just came to me.  We were assigned one year to read The<br/>
Scarlet Letter.  I didn&#39;t read the book till after the test and passed<br/>
with a pretty good grade.  During in class discussion I would try to<br/>
answer questions, and if I was patient, could actually do a good job<br/>
just from listening to the general discussion of the book.  By the<br/>
time we were supposed to have finished and then took the test, I was<br/>
actually interested enough to read it and enjoyed it.</div>
