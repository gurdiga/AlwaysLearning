Who would be with the children if both parents work? That sounds like a much more realistic barrier to unschooling than any diagnoses. Have they asked you about unschooling? Is it something they&#39;re interested in?<br/>
<br/>
As far as unschooling and autism in general, why would unschooling a child with a diagnoses be any different than unschooling a child without one? The foundation of unschooling is to facilitate learning in ways that work for your child, that doesn&#39;t change because the child is considered by others to be non-typical. I think most unschoolers would agree that there is already no such thing as &quot;typical&quot; anyway :-) and LOTS of unschooling families would likely have children with long streams of diagnoses if their children were schooled. There is far less need to label a child who isn&#39;t being forced to fit into a system that doesn&#39;t work for him or her. I&#39;m not saying that autism isn&#39;t &quot;real,&quot; just that it doesn&#39;t effect unschooling the way it effects having to get by in a school system. With unschooling, you adapt your life so that it works with rather than against you child. Differences aren&#39;t detrimental, they&#39;re simply part of the information a parent considers when helping a child navigate the world.<br/>
<br/>
As far as articles or books, I don&#39;t know what this child&#39;s diagnoses would have been had he been in school, but I think Lyla&#39;s website speaks well to the concerns you might have: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://learningthroughliving.wordpress.com/2010/06/11/unschooling-the-atypical-child-by-lyla-wolfenstein/">http://learningthroughliving.wordpress.com/2010/06/11/unschooling-the-atypical-child-by-lyla-wolfenstein/</a><br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1433300294">also, i have a friend (not on this list) who&#39;s unschooling 2 children with<br/>
autism, and very successfully. i know several others as well.  like someone<br/>
said - it&#39;s not the autism, it&#39;s the lack of  interest or the time that<br/>
would make unschooling difficult.<br/>

has some ideas<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling works the same way for an autistic child as for any other child.  Trying not to focus on &quot;the problem&quot; or the label might be the most helpful thing of all.<br/>
