<div id="ygrps-yiv-558874355">My 8yo ds is writing a family newspaper tonight.  He&#39;s been bored all <br/>
day(rainy and chilly)and has Finally found something to DO.<br/>
He keeps asking me how to spell certain words and I keep telling him.<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking about how much he is learning about the way things <br/>
are pronounced and the actual spelling of them, and how ideas are <br/>
probably changing and reconfigurating in his head with every word.<br/>
He just asked  how to spell &#39;reason&#39;.  After I told him, I said &quot;it&#39;s <br/>
weird how things sound and things are spelled isn&#39;t it?&quot; and he <br/>
said &quot;YES!&quot; A minute later he said &quot; &#39;Put&#39; is spelled P O O T, <br/>
right?&quot; I said &quot;No, P U T.&quot;<br/>
He said &quot;But it sounds like foot!&quot;<br/>
He was happy with the way &#39;quietly&#39;is spelled.<br/>
&#39;Said&#39; annoyed him.<br/>
He just asked how to spell &#39;computer&#39;.  I said, &quot;C O M&quot; he <br/>
repeated, &quot;C O N&quot; and I said &quot;C O M, mmmmmmm, M not N.&quot;  He said,<br/>
&quot;But it&#39;s conputer!??&quot;   I had to laugh at that one.<br/>
This is the most he&#39;s written......ever!<br/>
He has a grasp on some basic words.  He knew &#39;have&#39; has an &#39;e&#39; at the <br/>
end.<br/>
I can&#39;t wait to read this article!<br/>

English language which I can&#39;t find but is in the shelf somewhere.  The<br/>
amount of languages involved in the English language are many.  After<br/>
every area conquered or someone conquered the English new words were<br/>
adopted.  It really helped my son and myself know why there are so many<br/>
contradictions in the English Language.  lisa<br/>

translations. <br/>
We have been guilty of these -- bruschetta and maraschino pronounced with a<br/>
soft c (such as cell) instead of the hard c (like call). He said &quot;just<br/>
think about how you say chianti!&quot;<br/>
