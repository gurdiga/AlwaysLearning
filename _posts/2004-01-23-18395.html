<div id="ygrps-yiv-1460101836">I just went off on a little internet journey.  I started reading at the<br/>
magazine&#39;s site, and saw something about Peace Pilgrim.  I had never<br/>
heard of her, so I followed the link to her site, and started reading<br/>
the online book about her life.  There I came upon this little unschooly<br/>
quote:<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;I received no formal religious training as a child. (It would be less<br/>
that I would have to undo from my mind later on!) &quot;<br/>
 <br/>
So, thanks for the link.  The magazine does look nice, and led me<br/>
somewhere I&#39;ve never been before :0).  ~Rue<br/>

I have a subscription. They donated a one year subscription to the conference <br/>
last year, but I don&#39;t know who won it. Great magazine! I keep two or three ( <br/>
I ordered back issues---not too expensive: it&#39;s only been out a year! &lt;g&gt;) in <br/>
my bag when I&#39;m out and about, If I&#39;m standing in line and see a &quot;whiney&quot; <br/>
child who is getting on her mon&#39;s last nerve (or the other wya around! &lt;g&gt;), I&#39;ll <br/>
pull it out and wow both the mom and child----it usually keeps them busy for <br/>
time we&#39;re in line. Colorful, fun, creative!<br/>

<br/>

last year, but I don&#39;t know who won it. Great magazine!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yahoo ... I won it!<br/>
<br/>
The first (and only so far) issue to arrive was the music issue.  I showed it to my daughter and a half-hour later she came down asking for plastic bottles.  She soon returned with a bottle buzzer (made from instructions in the magazine) and her and her brother were making and playing with them for a couple hours that day.  They sound really interesting!<br/>
<br/>
In the evening I remember I was hanging in her room with her going through the magazine.  It was funny because just a week or so before we were discussing the old &quot;tree falling in the woods&quot; question in the car, and her comment was of course it made a sound!  And then they talked about it in that issue (no, it doesn&#39;t make a sound, it makes vibrations).  I also pointed out the Theremin and mentioned I remembered seeing one at our local Science Centre.  The next time we visited we made a point of checking it out.  <br/>
<br/>
Cool connections.<br/>

PS  Sorry for posting before formally introducing myself, but I couldn&#39;t resist (some of you might &quot;know&quot; me from UnschoolingDiscussion).  I only found and joined this group a couple weeks ago (and it took yahoo a while to start sending emails) so I&#39;ve just been reading along.<br/>

 The year before (first year of the conference), Will Tucker got to play the <br/>
Theremin for Kevin Dunn, as he told the story of Dr. Suess&#39; pants! It was <br/>
ADORABLE! <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad to know you won the magazine, Pam! You ought to get some back <br/>
issues----&quot;Babies&quot; is excellent!<br/>

Doesn&#39;t matter.   I don&#39;t care who people are as much as I care that they&#39;re <br/>
interesting and helpful!<br/>
