<div id="ygrps-yiv-19758630">Hi. I don&#39;t want to get anyone here muddled up in stuff that might distract from this list,  so can anyone here tell me of a thread that may have occurred on this list regarding spouses who aren&#39;t always cooperative when it comes to unschooling? I have searched different words and am not getting anything. I may be searching wrong. Or maybe someone knows of a particular section of anyone&#39;s blog or website that might deal with this. <br/>
<br/>
The issues my husband and I are dealing with are not new. It&#39;s been going on since our kids were little (and the oldest is now in his early 20&#39;a, the youngest is 12). It&#39;s about the reasons behind unschooling and trusting that it will work. I sometimes liken it to a conservative Republican and liberal Democrat being married and raising kids together (as an analogy of our parenting/educational differences).  It&#39;s doable but not easy. <br/>
<br/>
I love reading this group. It is so wonderful. So full of great things and ideas to chew on, mull over and implement. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

It won&#39;t be a distraction to discuss ways to make your home a warm, comfortable place for everyone, including your husband ;). Generally speaking, though a lot of times when the husband isn&#39;t happy with unschooling it will help to extend some of the principles and benefits of unschooling in his direction. Be sensitive to his thoughts, feelings and needs. Love him up. Remember that teaching can produce resistance and frustration! So if you&#39;re trying to teach him to be an unschooler, that&#39;s not helping him or your kids. Help him and the kids get along in ways which work for all of them. <br/>
<br/>
You could search for &quot;husband on board&quot; - that&#39;s a phrase which gets used frequently with spouses. Or you could post your specific concerns and get some feedback that way. <br/>

I don&#39;t think it will muddle up the list to discuss it.<br/>

<br/>
If your husband went somewhere and aske people what to do regarding his wife who wan&#39;t always cooperative about... (something--cooking, politics, doing what he wanted you to do about something, acting the way he wanted you to about something) would that be odd?<br/>
<br/>
If in twenty years you haven&#39;t persauded him, and your kids&#39; learning hasn&#39;t impressed him that it will work, where might he have gotten more confidence?<br/>
<br/>
Has he been to a conference and seen older unschoolers?  (Ever?  if ever, was it when your kids were younger?)<br/>
Do you socialize with any other unschooling families?<br/>
