<div id="ygrps-yiv-621427726"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; My apologies, Sandra - and the rest of the list!!  I should have read all<br/>
&gt; the responses to Tia&#39;s post before posting mine.  If anyone would like to<br/>
&gt; continue the conversation, I would be more than happy to be emailed off<br/>
&gt; list to keep still the waters of this peaceful cove.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess I have to apologize as well.  I was surprised to find that people<br/>
don&#39;t want it here.  It was posted to the Canadian list, and there are<br/>
people there whose husbands are likely to have to go.  I&#39;m one who needs to<br/>
talk about things that worry or upset me, and I&#39;ve been really bummed about<br/>
this.  I&#39;ll talk about it elsewhere.<br/>
