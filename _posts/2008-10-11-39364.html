<br/>
I have been organizing by office for days and came across a handout.  I <br/>
am not sure where it came from.  Sounds like an introduction that was <br/>
made by Daniel Quinn, author of Ishmael, at an unschooling conference.<br/>
<br/>
It is a fascinating piece and I thought I would share a link to the <br/>
article with you:<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a lot in that that makes sense. <br/>
<br/>
I recall when my always schooled daughter was about eight - which<br/>
would be 1993 - having a conversation with the Principal of her then<br/>
school in which I commented on the absence from the classroom of<br/>
accelerated learning techniques I knew had been around since the<br/>
1970s. &quot;It&#39;s too impractical&quot; was more or less the sum total of his<br/>
explanation for that. Maybe that incident sowed the seeds of more than<br/>
just idle curiosity, I don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
I was very involved with all four of my daughter&#39;s schools (two in the<br/>
UK, two in Australia), but I was seldom in the classroom getting a<br/>
view of the teaching, and my daughter was always amongst the<br/>
&#39;frontrunners&#39; in every class she was in, so there was no cause for<br/>
concern. <br/>
<br/>
That all changed when her ten years younger brother started school.<br/>
Especially in his second year - 2002 - when he was becoming<br/>
progressively unhappier. By then, I was in the school every day, at<br/>
the very least for morning assembly, often helping out in some way in<br/>
the classroom. And by this time, the internet had become a part of my<br/>
daily life. A fantastic learning resource. Taken advantage of daily by<br/>
me and by my son. So, whenever I got into my son&#39;s classroom, I<br/>
couldn&#39;t help but notice the amount of fluff and padding in a typical<br/>
school day, more consciously than I&#39;d never noticed it before. I<br/>
couldn&#39;t help but notice that it was taking an hour to teach my son<br/>
what he could learn for himself in two minutes. <br/>
<br/>
After my son had asked to be taken out of school, my wife and I were<br/>
pondering on that for quite a while. Then one day I was once again in<br/>
his classroom, helping out with some mathematics project or other. And<br/>
I&#39;m sitting there and suddenly I realise, &quot;Gosh, this is like<br/>
occupational therapy. It&#39;s basket weaving.&quot; (&quot;Gosh&quot; wasn&#39;t the actual<br/>
word that sprang to mind). That was the end of my efforts to help my<br/>
son adapt to school culture. It wasn&#39;t until about seven weeks later<br/>
that it happened for real, but he was out of there from that moment.<br/>
<br/>
I prefer my son to learn at the speed of thought not wait around for<br/>
somebody to teach him at the speed of watching paint dry. That&#39;s how<br/>
it was, and is, and will always be.<br/>

P.S. Perhaps I should have added &quot;Amen&quot; to that. :-)</div>

Hey... you didn&#39;t need to!  It came to mind.<br/>

<br/>
Teacher: If there are four birds sitting on a fence and a farmer<br/>
shoots one of them, how many birds are there left on the fence?<br/>
<br/>
Student: None<br/>
<br/>
Teacher: Wrong. The answer is three.<br/>
<br/>
Student: No it isn&#39;t. The other three birds would have flown off when<br/>
they heard the gunshot.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That was very interesting, indeed!<br/>
<br/>
I wondered about his point that when puberty hits, interest in<br/>
learning declines. Have those of you who have/had teens noticed this<br/>
trend, as well? I know teens definitely start taking an interest in<br/>
sex, of course, but hadn&#39;t thought of the correlation to WANTING to<br/>
learn (vs. trying to focus during a classroom lecture while<br/>
fantasizing about sex!)<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, my desire to learn INCREASED as a teen only because for<br/>
the first 8 years of my schooling career I was so focused on trying<br/>
not to become the object of ridicule each and every day that I didn&#39;t<br/>
care at all what was being taught. But high school (public vs. the<br/>
private I HAD BEEN attending) was a much more free environment for me,<br/>
with more people, different kinds of teachers, and more subjects that<br/>
opened up interesting discussions for me. Not that it was ideal<br/>
compared to unschooling, but compared to what I had HAD, it was<br/>
tremendous! <br/>
<br/>
On the flip side, though, I was one of the few girls I knew who DID<br/>
think &quot;mate, mate, mate!&quot; all the time! LOL! And because I knew<br/>
waiting until you were married to have sex is a wise idea, I would<br/>
fantasize that I was married at the young ripe age of 13, 14, 15, etc.<br/>
I&#39;ve always felt it was unfair to a degree for a person to hit the<br/>
peek of their sexual desire when the &quot;ideal&quot; age of starting a family<br/>
in our culture is years away. I envied the early societies where<br/>
people married young, though I didn&#39;t envy the hardships they endured.<br/>
But from a hormonal teen&#39;s point of view, at least they had one thing<br/>
going for them.<br/>
<br/>
I will say that an analogy came to me as well. Before I was married I<br/>
constantly (unlike most women, according to studies, though more are<br/>
admitting to sharing my experience) thought about sex. But after I was<br/>
married and there was an outlet for that desire, I was more free to<br/>
think about other interests, or mundane things like work ;) <br/>
<br/>
I think the same can be said about food, perhaps? When I limit myself<br/>
to a few sweets, they are all I can think about, but when I can have<br/>
as many as I want, I eventually say, &quot;Well, I&#39;m not really hungry<br/>
right now, no thank you.&quot; My desire for sweets isn&#39;t gone, it&#39;s just<br/>
satisfied enough that I don&#39;t OBSESS about it anymore.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not at all.<br/>
<br/>
However, the ages of about 8 to 12 are sometimes known as the &quot;fact- <br/>
gathering stage.&quot; The type of learning might be more like what most  <br/>
schools (these days) teach - testable stuff. After that age, the teens  <br/>
might be more interested in gaining understanding of the world - more  <br/>
interested in human behavior, animal behavior, scientific thought,  <br/>
philosophy, politics, religion, etc. Or they might be more interested  <br/>
in pursuing specific interests like art or music.<br/>
<br/>
So - in school - it could very easily appear that the teens are,  <br/>
generally, less interested in learning. But I&#39;d say the truth is that  <br/>
they&#39;re less interested in learning most of what the schools are  <br/>
trying to teach, while still passionately interested in learning.<br/>

I didn&#39;t notice it at our house, because it was never &quot;an interest in  <br/>
learning&quot; that caused them to learn in the first place.  It was  <br/>
living in a house where everyone was sharing information and ideas,  <br/>
music and movies and trivia all the time.  Still.  I just left the  <br/>
dinner table where Keith, Holly, Marty and Brett (Holly&#39;s boyfriend)  <br/>
were talking up a storm about comic-book hero movies.  Marty and  <br/>
Brett both know quite a bit, and Brett used to work at a comic book  <br/>
store.  I had watched the special features on Ironman and so could  <br/>
actually contribute a bit to the discussion.   Holly and I told a  <br/>
couple of stories about The Duchess, which we saw this afternoon.  We  <br/>
talked about the food, about my lunch with friends today, about  <br/>
Christmas music this fall.  It was FUN.  It was stimulating.  And  <br/>
everyone there is sexually active.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking about the relationships my kids have been in, and they  <br/>
were all based on hobbies and shared interests, so being with their  <br/>
boyfriends or girlfriends has involved doing and being and exploring  <br/>
as much as being with the family has.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Our culture is as screwed up about sex and marriage as it is about  <br/>
other things, I&#39;m pretty sure.  I could be wrong.<br/>
