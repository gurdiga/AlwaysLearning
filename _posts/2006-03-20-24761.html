<div id="ygrps-yiv-1630008127">My dad sent this to me, and it was so cool I wanted to forward it on.  <br/>
For all those who are into art, music, selling, recycling, inventing,  <br/>
countless other passions, including just noise. I must say, he&#39;s  <br/>
catching on to this unschooling bit ;-)  Once he grokked the  <br/>
fullness, it seemed to make more sense to him. now he just forwards  <br/>
everything to me, and since he&#39;s retired and always online, he finds  <br/>
lots of cool stuff. He&#39;s kind of an unschooler himself. He&#39;s really  <br/>
into making flutes right now.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; ANd if you&#39;re wondering just how long to cut them , here is a site  <br/>
&gt; that can tell you that . . .  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.windworld.com/tools/">http://www.windworld.com/tools/</a> <br/>
&gt; freebar/index.html<br/>
&gt; I would use cm just for exactness . . . but it will figure it for  <br/>
&gt; what ever measure you wish to use .<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Anyways . . . I thought those websites were inspirational & could  <br/>
&gt; be done with junk on hand or findable . Either way , have a good  <br/>
&gt; time with them & have a wonderful day .<br/>
&gt; Love always . . . Dad<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2019530332">Those pages are cool.  It would take an hour to look all around the  <br/>
Noisy Toys site.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve added those links to my music page.  They&#39;re down below the  <br/>
Encore cards here:<br/>
