Bill Ellis sent this (I guess because of the exchange with Isaac  <br/>
Graves on this list).  He sent the whole text, which I don&#39;t want to  <br/>
do here, but for those of you whose incalcitrent relatives are  <br/>
wanting &quot;proof,&quot; there might be things in that (and that site in  <br/>
general) you can use to quote.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a section:<br/>
<br/>
-=-       Considerable research has shown that students learn much  <br/>
more easily when they self-learn. As long ago as 1930,  the &quot;8 Year  <br/>
Study&quot; of 30 special schools demonstrated that: &quot;The most effective  <br/>
schools used a different approach to learning.  Instead of organizing  <br/>
learning by subjects, they organized it around themes of significance  <br/>
to their students.&quot; There seemed to be an inverse relationship  <br/>
between success in college and formalized education as opposed to  <br/>
student selected learning.<br/>
-=-       A recent Cornell University study confirmed this and showed  <br/>
that schooled children become &quot;peer dependent&quot; while those who  <br/>
learned with their parents have more self-confidence, optimism, and  <br/>
courage to explore. A Moore Foundation study of children of parents  <br/>
who had been arrested for truancy found that their homeschooled  <br/>
children ranked 30 percent higher on standard tests than the average  <br/>
classroom child.<br/>
-=-       Providing possible insight into the reasons behind these  <br/>
successes, a UCLA project showed that the average schooled student  <br/>
receives 7 minutes of personal attention a day but the self-learner  <br/>
receives from 100 to 300 minutes of attention daily. Following this,  <br/>
a Smithsonian Report on genius concluded that high achievement was a  <br/>
result of time with responsive parents, little time with peers, and  <br/>
considerable time for free exploration.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks, Isaac, for stirring that up for us.  I&#39;ve been to that site  <br/>
before, but it&#39;s good to be reminded, and this list gets new members  <br/>
constantly.<br/>
