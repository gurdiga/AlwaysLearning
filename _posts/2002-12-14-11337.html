<div id="ygrps-yiv-874561387">I work in retain and the other day a lady came through my line paying with a <br/>
check.  I was totally shocked when I read the names on the check and it <br/>
said...<br/>
<br/>
John Jones<br/>
Mrs. John Jones<br/>
<br/>
(OK I don&#39;t remember the exact names but you&#39;ll get the idea.)  I was amazed <br/>
that anyone would go that far!!  And she wasn&#39;t an old lady ether.  Maybe in <br/>
her 40&#39;s.  I was almost tempted to ask for her drivers liscense to see if it <br/>
said Mrs. John Jones!  It was weird.<br/>
<br/>
My name is first on our checks.  It was also my account first.  However even <br/>
if it weren&#39;t my name would be first because I do ALL of the paperwork in <br/>
our family.  Even when my husband goes to the eye doctor I end up filling <br/>
out all the questionairs for him and he signs the bottom.  He doesn&#39;t even <br/>
know our phone number without asking me!!!  That said I usually have filled <br/>
in the spouse line since he was the &#39;provider&#39;.  Now that we&#39;re both working <br/>
paying jobs we&#39;ll see what happens.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I saw an Australian drivers&#39; license, years ago.  It was a cheap paper <br/>
printout.  The woman was the daughter of the arts minister of a state, a <br/>
known name, and yet she was married to a good-for-nothing American who had <br/>
left her and gone back to California.  Yet her driver&#39;s license was issued to <br/>
Mrs. Him, whatever his name was.  Horrible.<br/>

referred to in the newspaper as Mr. , Mrs. or Miss you knew they were white.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1728831611">We had some homeschooling friends (strict christian -- school at home<br/>
people) and they always signed everything as Dr. and Mrs John Smith. It<br/>
even made my husband cringe so when I graduated we sent them a card with a<br/>
return address marked from Dr. and Mr. Kate Green -- think it went over<br/>
their head though:)<br/>
<br/>
In the Arab world women keep their original names when they get married and<br/>
never take on their husbands. Of course that&#39;s because they are still owned<br/>
thru the father&#39;s line and so have his lineage reflected in their names.<br/>
Their second name is the father, 3rd the grandfather, 4th greatgrandfather<br/>
and so on. Which can be interesting because the men are so often named<br/>
after their father or grandfather so you get a lot of repeats. I have<br/>
students with names like Mariam Ahmed Mohamed Ahmed Mohamed Ahmed Mohamed!<br/>
It can get very lengthy.<br/>
