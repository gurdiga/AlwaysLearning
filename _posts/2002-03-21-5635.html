<div id="ygrps-yiv-1625526398">Kate and Shyrley,<br/>
<br/>
By gum, I need some help with this here, eyup, eyup. The following are <br/>
lines from Pollyanna. Can you tell me if they sound at all familiar? Is <br/>
this a Cornish way of speaking? My grandfather’s parents were from Hull, <br/>
England, and he used to say “That car over there is his’n” -- these <br/>
lines also sound like that. Any idea?<br/>
<br/>
“Go on with yer jokin’. Why don’t ye tell me the sun is a-goin’ ter set <br/>
in the east termorrer?<br/>
<br/>
Why, it must be Miss Jennie’s little gal. Glory be ter praise! Ter think <br/>
of my old eyes a’seein’ this!<br/>
<br/>
I ain’t a-tellin’ that. If she’d just let that tight hair of hern all <br/>
out loose and careless-like and wear the sort of bunnits with posies in <br/>
‘em and the kind o’ dresses all lace and white...<br/>
<br/>
If ‘twa’n’t for the wages and the folks at home what’s needin’ em, some <br/>
day I should jest bile over.<br/>
<br/>
I know. It’s nart-ral--but ‘tain’t best, child; ‘tain’t best.”<br/>

Yorkshire pudding is really REALLY good.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2054932434">LOL LOL&gt; LOL LOL LOL.... I was reading the previous e-mail and <br/>
thinking intensely about translating and how to respond when I <br/>
clicked on Sandra&#39;s response and couldn&#39;t stop laughing.  DH are <br/>
sitting at side by side computers and I couldn&#39;t stop laughing and he <br/>
wanted to know the joke.  I don&#39;t think he knows about Redwall on PBS <br/>
and he certainly wouldn&#39;t know the difference between a Cornish <br/>
accent and Yorkshire... Thanks for the laugh Sandra.... I think I&#39;ll <br/>
make Yorkshire Pud this weekend..<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2071197833">I don&#39;t know about these, sorry. Could be anything to me but then I sound<br/>
more South African/snotty Brit than UK regional so what do I know (moved<br/>
around way too much).<br/>
We love Redwall series -- is it really on PBS now? Hope we can catch reruns<br/>
in a couple of years. <br/>
Grandma sent great Christmas presents of Terry Pratchett videos so maybe<br/>
Redwall will be out for next year.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-298583866">&lt;&lt;I thought Pollyana was set in America. Written in 1913.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It was published in 1913--set in Beldingsville, Vermont, in 1910. The <br/>
servant-type people in the book sound to me like they&#39;re not far removed <br/>
from England, though, which seems logical.<br/>
<br/>
Our homeschool theater group is doing the play (based a whole lot more <br/>
on the book than the Disney movie was) and we&#39;re not sure how the <br/>
servants are supposed to sound.<br/>
<br/>
When I posted all those quotes, did they come through looking like <br/>
gibberish? On my computer they looked like things look when sent to me <br/>
(to my Mac) by a friend who has a PC.<br/>
