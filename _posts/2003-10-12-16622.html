<div id="ygrps-yiv-406698747">We&#39;re members of the Free State Project and are now looking for unschoolers in New Hampshire.  Anyone out there?  <br/>
 <br/>
Homeschooling in NH is not nearly as free as in MI, and I&#39;m just wondering how badly I&#39;ll have to contort myself to keep unschooling.  Oddly, we&#39;re moving there to live more freely, only we&#39;ll be taking two giants steps backward with homeschooling first.  Sigh.  <br/>
 <br/>
My youngest will be 12 by the time we move, so it will only be a problem for a couple of years at most.  We&#39;re hoping to change that kind of thing when we get there.<br/>
 <br/>
Appreciate any info.<br/>

Hi Retta.  I&#39;ve heard about this.  That is cool.  I hope it works out <br/>
the way you all plan it.<br/>
<br/>
I am not from NH, but we have an New England Unschoolers list that <br/>
has someone from the White Mountains on it.  Maybe she can help you <br/>
find others in New Hampshire.  You can find out about it on the yahoo <br/>
group <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NewEnglandUnschooling/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NewEnglandUnschooling/</a> or by <br/>
going to the yahoo.com page and typing in NewEnglandUnschooling (all <br/>
one word) in the search bar.  We are planning Unschooling get <br/>
togethers.  We have two get together&#39;s already planned.  Both are in <br/>
MA but if you know of a place that is convenient for everyone to get <br/>
to, we are looking for indoor places to meet for the winter.<br/>
