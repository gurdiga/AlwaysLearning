<br/>
While there is nothing that is really a must read for everyone, I will argue absolutely for introducing these books to children.  They are well written and from a child&#39;s perspective most of the time.  In the first book the only times things outside Laura&#39;s sight are told as stories.  As she ages things are introduced into the storyline that she was not privy to and are not mentioned as stories...a maturing of the story telling process as the main character matures.<br/>
<br/>
There are things that we shake our heads at today, but so what?  If my child has questions about something that seem strange and unusual to him, he asks and we talk about it.  I am sure when we read these books, if he wants to, he will have questions and we will talk and explore.  Will you not read/introduce Huckleberry Finn, or Gone With the Wind, or other wonderful books because what is in them is not politically correct for the current time? <br/>
<br/>
As for Ma&#39;s reactions to Indians, remember she also was a product of her time, and it is a counterpoint to Pa&#39;s wanderlust and desires to meet them.  When Laura sees Indians, she wants to become one.  What child hasn&#39;t?  All these reactions are true to the characters, and provide an aspect to fill them out as full fictional people.<br/>
<br/>
Before making a decision, do a little reading about these books, this storyline, what was put in and what was left out...I had a lot of admiration for the author and editor, and the stories themselves, after I learned more about them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1640378188">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;and provide an aspect to fill them out as full fictional people.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Huh? Real people weren&#39;t they - Laura Ingalls Wilder&#39;s real life <br/>
recollections?<br/>
<br/>
I have read the entire collection. The final book was put together from her <br/>
mother&#39;s notes by Rose and is clearly unfinished and lacking in detail by <br/>
comparison.<br/>
<br/>
From the first moments of the first book when Laura wrote about the joking <br/>
painless spanking one for each year on her birthday, I was waiting for the <br/>
real one. Dreading it colored my whole experience of reading the book.<br/>
<br/>
My heart ached for Amalzo (sp?) as he waited in absolute terror for his <br/>
accidental damage to the wallpaper to be discovered. I was proud of his <br/>
sister for secretly helping him.<br/>
<br/>
I was disgusted by Ma, not by her racist attitude towards Native Americans <br/>
because that really was so much a product of its time, but because of her <br/>
unbending, rigid desire to control her children - the narrowness of her <br/>
thinking over such picayune trivia as insisting on controlling what colored <br/>
ribbon they could wear in their hair, her shaming language and attitude <br/>
towards them, her endless comparing.<br/>
<br/>
I think the saddest thing might have been Laura&#39;s perpetual and abiding <br/>
shame that she was not as good as her sister Mary. It seemed to me that her <br/>
moments of joy were entirely in the context of being lucky almost stolen, <br/>
undeserved. She saw herself as &quot;less than&quot; for her entire childhood, and for <br/>
that I blame her Ma and her Pa who beat her with a belt because in <br/>
frustration she hit her perfect sister. They were totally left alone to sort <br/>
out any differences they had also.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose my greatest shock at the whole series was because I had only ever <br/>
heard it touted by homeschoolers especially as &quot;so wonderful&quot;, Pa was such a <br/>
gentle father, Ma held up as a saint, their parenting (firm and fair) <br/>
supposed to be exemplary and to be emulated today. People in the <br/>
homeschooling movement seemed called to identify with the pioneer spirit. <br/>
Plus they had almost no toys so how perfect!<br/>
<br/>
I found parents who were gentle only by the unbending standards of the time. <br/>
I was incredulous for most of my reading experience - &quot;these are the <br/>
paragons of parenting virtue?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I believe that we can do better.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Robin~<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry.  I don&#39;t know if this is a question<br/>
for the list or for me.  I will answer for me.<br/>
<br/>
The question was:  Do these books offer learning<br/>
opportunities that can&#39;t be found elsewhere?  My<br/>
answer is no.  They don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Before making a decision, do a little reading about <br/>

&gt; was left out...I had a lot of admiration for the author <br/>
&gt; and editor, and the stories themselves, after I learned <br/>
&gt; more about them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have always loved books and myths and storytelling.<br/>
I love everything from _A Hole is to Dig_ (so simple, <br/>
yet so profound!) and _A Tree is Nice_ and Shel Silverstein<br/>
right on through Joseph Campbell and &quot;The Power of Myth.&quot;  <br/>
Before my first child was born, I was a children&#39;s<br/>
librarian and a professional storyteller.  <br/>
<br/>
I have been a fan of the _Little House_ books since <br/>
I was a child.  I read them again, and studied them in <br/>
depth, when I was obtaining my Master&#39;s degree in Library <br/>
Science.  So, I HAVE done &quot;a little reading about these books.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I like to compare the writing of the books written by <br/>
Rose Wilder, Laura&#39;s daughter, with the books written by <br/>
Laura herself, namely, _The First Four Years_ and Laura&#39;s travelogue.  Yes, Laura&#39;s name appears as author on all the <br/>
books, but if you compare the writing of _The First Four Years_ <br/>
and Laura&#39;s travelogue against the rest of the series, it <br/>
becomes clear that they were not written by the same person.  <br/>
Read anything Rose wrote under her own name and it becomes even <br/>
more obvious that Rose wrote the beloved series.  Laura may<br/>
have dictated, or Rose was inspired by Laura&#39;s childhood<br/>
recollections....<br/>
<br/>
We really like these books. I have read them to all <br/>
of my children. My kids enjoyed them, and then Netflixing <br/>
the TV series, and comparing/contrasting the stories, the <br/>
characters, the worldview of the books, versus the TV show.<br/>
That said, if my adoptive children, who really have <br/>
experienced physical abuse, objected to the content<br/>
and wanted me to stop reading them aloud, I would<br/>
respect that.  I would stop.  Even though I, personally,<br/>
like the books.<br/>
<br/>
My son, Caleb, decided to learn the fiddle tunes Pa<br/>
plays throughout the series.  As I mentioned in an<br/>
earlier post, we churned butter and visited maple<br/>
farms to see the trees being tapped, and later, the<br/>
sap being boiled down into syrup, around the same<br/>
time we were reading the series.  We&#39;ve cooked<br/>
_Little House_ recipes and made _Little House_<br/>
crafts.  <br/>
<br/>
I am not a censor.  But a mother asked if her<br/>
sensitive child, who happens to be of Native <br/>
American heritage, missed out by not reading<br/>
these books, if there were anything to be learnt<br/>
there that could be learned nowhere else, my<br/>
answer is no.  I stand by that.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, books, and TV, and movies, and life,<br/>
will present us with points of view and attitudes<br/>
we find offensive.  And we will learn from looking<br/>
at and thinking about and discussing that which offends <br/>
us.  But MUST the original poster&#39;s child read *these <br/>
particular books* in order to learn lessons that can be <br/>
learnt nowhere else?<br/>
<br/>
I say no.  <br/>
<br/>
Yes, she will miss out on Rose Wilder&#39;s<br/>
lyrical prose, e.g., how she describes Laura<br/>
falling to sleep, under a prairie sky full of<br/>
stars, to the sounds of her Pa&#39;s fiddle.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I would put this series on a list of<br/>
books I recommend.<br/>
<br/>
I still don&#39;t know what book(s) are absolute<br/>
must reads.  That&#39;s a tough question:  What<br/>
books MUST everybody read?<br/>
<br/>
I admit I am responding with emotion.  I<br/>
feel that I have been called a censor.  But<br/>
I was a librarian who would have been willing<br/>
to go to jail rather than turn a patron&#39;s library<br/>
records over to the authorities.  I am the furthest<br/>
thing from a censor that you can find.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny that you mention _Huck Finn_.  I am reading<br/>
that to the family right now.  I didn&#39;t stop reading<br/>
to my kids, even when they got old enough to read<br/>
themselves.  Everybody (in our family, anyway) loves<br/>
being read to.  _Huck Finn_ is a challenging read-aloud,<br/>
b/c of the dialects and accents.  And of course, the<br/>
content is challenging.  Which is one of the things<br/>
that makes it so good.<br/>

None. I agree with you that there is no such thing as a book that everyone MUST read. There is nothing that everyone MUST learn. But then, I was raised by a librarian/storyteller.;)<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s hugely freeing to realize that there isn&#39;t any information in the world that absolutely everyone MUST learn about. <br/>

There is nothing.  Not one single book.<br/>

People should read or listen to books they want to, but without a wad  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-551324566">-=While there is nothing that is really a must read for everyone, I  <br/>

<br/>
&quot;Introducing&quot; is stronger than &quot;making available&quot; or &quot;recommending,&quot;  <br/>
and unless it creates a better unschooling environment, this list is  <br/>
the wrong place to &quot;argue absolutely.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-There are things that we shake our heads at today, but so what?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Some of them were harmful then and can still be harmful now is what.<br/>
<br/>
A book that shows girls as silly and helpless might be interesting as  <br/>
contrast IF a girl is interested in that historical perspective, but  <br/>
three of them without contrast is not as good an idea.  Six held up as  <br/>
good examples is altogether creepy.<br/>
<br/>
When an unschooling family wants to relive Little House on the Prairie  <br/>
as though it were a documentary rather than a fictionalIZED version of  <br/>
whatever might actually have happened (any time there&#39;s dialog it  <br/>
turns from history to historical fiction), that is creepy too.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not the 19th century.  It&#39;s not even the 20th century.  To raise  <br/>
a child to pine for the past and despise the moment isn&#39;t illegal, but  <br/>
it doesn&#39;t help people understand natural learning.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s not &quot;a decision&quot; once and for all to be made, though.  It was  <br/>
an invitation for ideas and advice.  Let&#39;s not let the list be about  <br/>
winning and losing and emotional arguments, if possible.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1056212000"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; There are some books that transcend language like the <br/>
&gt; classic fables and some world wide well known writers.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Grimms&#39; Fairy Tales?  Disney absolutely ruined &#39;em...<br/>
as stories (IMHO). As artwork?  A totally different story.<br/>
<br/>
I imagine that it would be interesting<br/>
to see Disney&#39;s &quot;Little Mermaid&quot; before reading the<br/>
classical fairy tale.  (We read the classic version, watched<br/>
the Disney vesion, and watched &quot;Splash.&quot;  Everybody liked<br/>
&quot;Splash&quot; best.)  I have to imagine, as I did it<br/>
the other way &#39;round.  Likewise, my kids saw &quot;Star<br/>
Wars&quot; in this order:  Episode One, then Two, and etc.,<br/>
up through Six.  I saw Episodes Four, Five, and Six,<br/>
then One, Two and Three.  It creates a different experience.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t know, until college, that Prince Charming<br/>
did quite a bit more than *kiss* the princess to <br/>
bring her out of her deathly slumber.  It was a home run,<br/>
baby. Ozzy&#39;s &quot;Paradise by the Dashboard Light.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Cinderella&#39;s stepsisters chopped off parts of their<br/>
feet, in deperation to fit into the glass slippers.<br/>
That doesn&#39;t show up in Disney.<br/>
<br/>
I leave it to parents, who are highly attuned to their<br/>
children, to know if/when to suggest they read these...<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line:  if you love literature, and you love<br/>
your kids, there&#39;s a chance they&#39;ll at least *like*<br/>
literature, too.  And if they don&#39;t, as my non-native<br/>
English speakers don&#39;t, do what I do:  join them on<br/>
their MMORPGs (or whatever interests them).  Stories are <br/>
everywhere.  I let THEM introduce ME to the mythology and <br/>
the lore asssociated therewith, and the turnabout in roles<br/>
benefits all of us.<br/>
<br/>
I can certainly see feeling affonted by _Little House_.<br/>
My adoptive daugher is absolutey gorgeous, if I do say so<br/>
myself.  But her hair and eyes are black, and, sadly, she <br/>
wishes for blonde hair and blue eyes, like my biological daughter has.  Shades of Mary and Laura?  Definitely.  It is hard for<br/>
Samantha to see that Amelia and I look so alike, when she looks<br/>
completely different.  That just plain HURTS.  It becomes a jumping off point for conversations.  Like the idea that kids should sit quietly in chairs, all day on Sunday.<br/>
<br/>
Ha!  That won&#39;t ever happen around here.  But it did happen, in<br/>
Laura&#39;s life.<br/>
<br/>
So what?  What do my kids think about it?  That&#39;s what I care<br/>
about.  We go out in the sun for the few weeks it shines up here,<br/>
and let our skin go brown, and rejoice in that.  We aren&#39;t tied<br/>
down by bonnets.  We go barefoot, a stolen luxury for Laura.<br/>
Beautiful prose, _Little House_ is, and full of great conversation starters, but not a must read.<br/>
<br/>
Okay... how about this:  Federal and state consistutions<br/>
(or whatever applies where you live)?  Must reads?<br/>
I still say no.  I don&#39;t know what qualities make a good<br/>
citizen, but forcing &quot;civics&quot; classes on kids won&#39;t do,<br/>
hasn&#39;t done it.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not dependent on, but definitely influenced by.  I have five <br/>
musical children.  If I had only bio kids, you might say they <br/>
inherited musical talent from their parents.  But 3/5 of them <br/>
are adoptive children, and still they all show strong interests <br/>
in playing intstruments and jamming together as a family, at home<br/>
and on local stages.  Because it is fun.  Because we (Mike and I, <br/>
the parents, who met in high school band) set that role model:  <br/>
playing music with people you care about is just plain fun.<br/>
<br/>
Everything we do, our kids watch, and emulate, or reject.<br/>
(But mostly emulate.)<br/>
<br/>
And so they learn, because of us or in spite of us.<br/>
Let is be because of us, because we set an example so <br/>
beautiful that they want to follow it.  Let me not be<br/>
an example for my children of what not to do.<br/>
<br/>
Altruism:  there&#39;s another example.  I have incredibly<br/>
giving children. I was thinking about this during the<br/>
conversation about including conventionally parented <br/>
neighborhood children in family activities, about the<br/>
need to balance helping those kids see better possibilities<br/>
against the need to protect our own children against those<br/>
kids&#39; coarser aspects.  I thought A LOT about that one, b/c<br/>
I brought hurt kids into our family, for keeps.  <br/>
<br/>
If I had come to unschooling first, we might be a very <br/>
different family.  Smaller, and not muticultural.  Life<br/>
would be easier in some ways, but we&#39;d be poorer for it<br/>
in other ways.  I would have been afraid that the adoptive<br/>
kids&#39; hurts would overhwhelm the bio kids, and that we&#39;d just<br/>
never be happy again.  I would have been making fear-based<br/>
decisons.  We all would have missed out on countless learning<br/>
opportunities.  We all have so much to learn from one another.<br/>
Here&#39;s to making loving choices, even when it seems easier<br/>
to make a fear based choice!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, as it turns out, all of my kids are very generous, <br/>
and that is one of the qualities I like most about them.  <br/>
When Grandma was diagnosed with cancer, Amelia cut off her long, <br/>
long curly blonde locks and donated them to Locks of Love.<br/>
Caleb decided that instead of a birthday present this year,<br/>
he would ask his friends to donate to a charity that is trying<br/>
to fight human trafficking.  Yuyu volunteers at our local<br/>
hospice.  Mark and Samantha...and the three other kids, for <br/>
that matter, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE to plan and prepare and deliver<br/>
lunches to the Red Cross Friendship Center, to feed the hungry.<br/>
One day, delivering the lunches, a homeless man stopped me, and<br/>
touching my shoulder lightly, said, &quot;You are a good mom.&quot;  And I<br/>
didn&#39;t know quite what to say, so I just said, &quot;I have kind<br/>
children.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They regularly &quot;weed&quot; through their toy collections, <br/>
to donate toys to kids who have less.  Perhaps my greatest<br/>
legacy is that I raised kids who give a damn about others,<br/>
and will act on those beliefs.  Meanwhile, Mike, their dad,<br/>
is right now being tested as a possible marrow donor for some <br/>
very sick individual.  I hope he is a match, and will be able<br/>
to donate marrow.  His mother is dying; how cathartic could it<br/>
be to save another&#39;s life?  <br/>
<br/>
The people I love can be so incredibly selfless.  I think it <br/>
takes being appreciated for oneself to grow to be selfless... <br/>
Having a lot of stuff *AND* realizing that just having it doesn&#39;t bring happiness also helps move one towards altruism.<br/>
<br/>
Enough!  Bedtime!  Maybe not for the kids, but *I&#39;m* sleepy.<br/>

<br/>
Irrational or arbitrary fear is bad, I guess, but sensible decisions  <br/>
involve deciding whether one thing is less scary or less harmful than  <br/>
another thing, and so to say &quot;fear-based decisions&quot; are always bad  <br/>
doesn&#39;t seem good or right.  It&#39;s almost like a &quot;double-dog dare&quot; to  <br/>
challenge people to prove they aren&#39;t afraid by rejecting &quot;fear-based  <br/>
decisions.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If your husband were to decide that he feared a hospital staph  <br/>
infection if he gave marrow, or feared being unavailable to his dying  <br/>
mother because of it, it seems the positive spin is that he made a  <br/>
thoughtful decision and selflessly put his mom first.<br/>

Last week Supriya and I were playing &quot;Who&#39;s smarter than a fifth grader?&quot; Someone gave it to her as a birthday present couple years ago. I kept failing all the English questions. I did not know who Carl Sandberg was (now I do), and I haven&#39;t read &quot;Wind in the Willows&quot;. I have now put it on my list of books to read sometime soon.<br/>
<br/>
I do want to read some of these old books because it helps to get cultural references, like jokes in movies. I also want to watch the original Star Trek episodes for the same reason.<br/>

fashioned kinds of things.  It&#39;s a bit elitist to shun the modern world<br/>
in exclusion to some fictionalized idea of the past, that is seen as<br/>
somehow better.<br/>
<br/>
There are good things that came from times past.  Heirloom veggies are<br/>
one of them.  Gardening practices without herbicides and pesticides are<br/>
another.<br/>
<br/>
We have the Little House cookbook.  Chamille and I read the books up<br/>
until The Long &quot;boring&quot; Winter.  She couldn&#39;t get into that one at all,<br/>
and I totally understand why.  We watched a lot of the TV series because<br/>
we used to visit her great grandparents, and I would sew and crochet<br/>
with great grandma, and the girls would watch those videos with great<br/>
grandpa.<br/>
<br/>
The things that Chamille liked about the books were the snapshot moments<br/>
of what it was like &quot;back then&quot;.  She had issues with the way Ma was<br/>
afraid of the indians.  We talked a lot about that.  She remembers<br/>
really strongly, when Laura &quot;lost&quot; her little sister in the fields and<br/>
how scary that was for Laura, and how hard it must&#39;ve been for her to be<br/>
in charge of her little sister in that manner.  Chamille could relate to<br/>
that because she is so much older than her sister, and it&#39;s possible<br/>
that if we had been around during that time, she would&#39;ve been in charge<br/>
of her sister more, so that I could do all the manual labor.  Another<br/>
huge part that she remembers and really disliked was the treatment of<br/>
the family pet.  She couldn&#39;t understand why the dog couldn&#39;t get a ride<br/>
in the wagon.  Laura couldn&#39;t understand why Pa treated the dog in that<br/>
manner either, but accepted it because she had no choice.  Chamille<br/>
hated Pa for that!<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid, our family did a number of cross country road trips. <br/>
One of them was to visit as many of the Laura Ingalls heritage centers<br/>
as possible.  I loved it enormously.  I have really strong memories of<br/>
that experience and how it tied to the books.  I can even remember the<br/>
way some of those old houses and buildings smell.  I have a little metal<br/>
pencil sharpener that is in the shape of a well, from that trip.  It was<br/>
one of the few items I purchased as a souvenir from that trip.  Margaux<br/>
broke it.  I still have the little bucket, but the chain that held the<br/>
bucket so that you could crank the handle, is missing.  I&#39;ve never used<br/>
it as a pencil sharpener.</div>

<br/>
Those are cool NOW, but at the time, they were just the seeds the  <br/>
people could get or had saved.   In the past they weren&#39;t thrilled and  <br/>
excited by some 150 year old strain of tomatoes (not for its   <br/>
historicity, anyway).<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I love these kinds of memories!<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend whose parents kept him in the idealized early 20th  <br/>
century or late 19th, pretty much.   It came to mind because Marty  <br/>
asked his girlfriend to watch The Pirates of Penzance with him,  <br/>
because he likes it and she like pirates.  She didn&#39;t like it nearly  <br/>
enough for me to want Marty to marry her.  She didn&#39;t like it at all,  <br/>
as far as I could tell.   But why SHOULD someone in 2009 like jokes  <br/>
that have to be explained, from the 1880s?  If they do they do.   But  <br/>
this family I was thinking about was big into Gilbert and Sullivan,  <br/>
and that&#39;s what their kids knew and thought was funny.  They knew zip  <br/>
about Monty Python or Robin Williams or George Carlin.   He never ever  <br/>
owned a pair of jeans, even thought he was a boyscout.  He never ever  <br/>
owned a t-shirt until he was in his 20&#39;s; wore button-up shirts only.<br/>
<br/>
So in a way, he didn&#39;t live in the U.S. in the 1950&#39;s or 1960&#39;s or  <br/>
70&#39;s.  When he has grandchildren and they ask about those decades,  <br/>
he&#39;ll have very little of interest to say.  I kinda teased him about  <br/>
it one day and said it would be as if I time-travelled to ancient Rome  <br/>
and met someone who had never been to the colliseum, never been to a  <br/>
feast, never seen a centurion, never been to a parade...  BOring.<br/>
<br/>
Eye-witness to nothing much.<br/>

tool... now I&#39;m thinking of _Protecting the Gift_.<br/>
<br/>
So, there is another thing I like about the list:<br/>
clear use of language and clarity of thought.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate when people point out to me<br/>
that my thinking (and my expressions)<br/>
are muddied.  That helps me grow, to<br/>
think more clearly and to express those<br/>
thoughts more clearly.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t mean to sound/be obnoxious,<br/>
but I did/was.  If nobody pointed it out,<br/>
how could I ever hope to do/be better<br/>
in future?<br/>

I like some of the heirloom veggies for novelty. Some of them have better flavor than the new varieties but some don&#39;t . Some of the new varieties are more disease resistant. I value that when I have some disease running through my tomatoes and other vegetables. Last year my peppers did great. This year they are being hit by some fungal disease and I probably won&#39;t get any.? I won&#39;t treat with anything but if I didn&#39;t have stores to rely on and my food source was being depleted then I would want something to stop that. I found squash vine beetle on my pumpkins, squash etc. I try to find the eggs and get rid of them, but don&#39;t spray. I would be all for a variety that stopped them. I&#39;m pretty sure that some of?my plants will be wilting soon from the squash vine borers and that I won&#39;t get my pumpkins and maybe only?a few squash. My peach tree gets hits by some form of rust...I think. I know my old varieties of crabapples lose there leaves every year from cedar-apple rust. My new varieties have been resistance and maintain their leaves.<br/>
I do love non-heirloom oranges and watermelons with no seeds. <br/>
I don&#39;t think I could produce enough food for my family?if I only used heirloom varieties and no herbicides or pesticides. I would like to think I could but looking at my vegetable devastation every year by not doing this it makes me feel insecure about being able to provide all the food I would need. <br/>
Referring back to Laura Ingall&#39;s books. There is one where the locus walk through eating everything in their path. That was?an amazing story to me. Locus are still a big problem in Africa. Having them come through can be a matter of life a death. <br/>
That being said I also just heard a NyTimes writer talking about the estrogen type compounds affect on the amphibian population but also the affect on human males....I think the quote was a 7% affect that they are seeing in human male babies not have normal descending of the testicles because of this. The estrogen type compounds apparently come from many sources...plasticizers but also herbicides and/or pesticides. Still look for the article that the reporter was referring to. <br/>
<br/>
Another note on Little House on the Prairie.? I was an exchange student to Germany in 1983. I watched Little House on the Prairie everyday in German. I had seen it in the US, so I knew many of the stories already. <br/>
