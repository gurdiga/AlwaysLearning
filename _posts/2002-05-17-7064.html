<div id="ygrps-yiv-1775757786">Just to further elaborate on the NM &quot;tick report&quot;.......we&#39;ve been living in the southwest (CO/NM border area) for 15 plus years and have never gotten a tick.  We&#39;ve probably spent more daylight hours outside than inside.....the majority of the time by rivers and trees.  Actually........ one of my two year olds had a tick the size of cherry pit behind his ear (well........not quite that large) but that tick hitchhiked back from Kansas (now there&#39;s a place with TICKS)  with us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-672612665">Joylyn, don&#39;t feel bad. I had a client years ago who brought in his dog to<br/>
have a tick removed. He&#39;d tried and tried and it wouldn&#39;t come off. After a<br/>
quick exam, I tactfully pointed out it was her nipple. I explained it was an<br/>
easy mistake to make; I really felt bad for him (and the dog!) The problem<br/>
was, the next year he came back for the same thing. May have even been the<br/>
same nipple. I was still tactful, but this time he was so mortified I never<br/>

<br/>
New Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
I get flea bits in California.  With one friend, I had them from riding in <br/>
her car where she carried her saddle blanket and riding boots and suchlike.  <br/>
Last time I was there, I either got one from a dog or the carpet maybe.  One <br/>
fleabite.  I kept looking at it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think because they&#39;ve been so rare in my life (fleas) I have a worse <br/>
reaction to them than I might if they were normal around where I live.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have scorpions from Albuquerque on north.  When I was little I lived <br/>
in Fort Worth, Texas, and they were around in the house.  I stepped on one.  <br/>
It itched like a new bite for two or three days.  Right in the arch of my <br/>
foot.  Yuck!<br/>
<br/>
After that the only scorpion I saw in Espanola (north of Santa Fe) was one my <br/>
dad caught in the back of a truck that had come to his place of work from <br/>
Texas.  So he brought it for us to look at, but it was not a native New <br/>
Mexican.<br/>
<br/>
I know that in the south of the state there are some, but not in the north as <br/>
far as I&#39;ve ever seen or heard.<br/>
<br/>
What we do have that&#39;s bad is rare but real:  bubonic plague and hunta virus<br/>
Both have to do with rodents.  But now the doctors here are on them, and can <br/>
catch them early.  If you pass through New Mexico, tell the kids not to touch <br/>
any dead rodents, and not to reach into the nests of deermice.  That should <br/>
make them safe enough.  <br/>

each other.<br/>
I think it has to do with dogs/cats that come in from living who-knows-where<br/>
and start infesting the other animals.<br/>
There must be *some* fleas in AZ. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
I&#39;m not sure about wild critters.<br/>
<br/>
But, our dogs live in and around us.<br/>
They have free access in and out through a doggie door, which they use all<br/>
the time.<br/>
Our cat is an inside cat, she just goes outside periodically to roll around<br/>
in the sun and on the ground.<br/>
So, I guess you could say our dogs *are* restrained to the area around our<br/>
house, because it&#39;s a fenced yard.<br/>
Other than that, no, they live with us.<br/>

<br/>
???<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
We had a found puppy once who scratched a lot and we put a flea collar on him <br/>
for a while.    I never saw a flea,  just went with symptoms.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve used anti-flea puppy shampoo, but not for seeing fleas.  Just GPs. <br/>
<br/>
When we camp in the plague areas, we put flea powder on the dog because we <br/>
can&#39;t tell him not to touch dead rodents.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What about the wild<br/>
critters, coyotes and prarie dogs,hares,  etc.? Is<br/>
there no dog contact with them?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Prairie dogs don&#39;t get caught by dogs, in my experience.  Coyotes stay by <br/>
themselves.  So no contact directly.<br/>
<br/>
My cats catch mice, but we hold the cats in our laps a lot and haven&#39;t gotten <br/>
any fleabites.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m most glad we don&#39;t have is chiggers.  They are creepy creatures and <br/>
make beautiful lush lawns unwalkable, unsittable, and don&#39;t even THINK about <br/>
lying down in chigger-land.<br/>

<br/>
We moved into an adorable little pink one-bedroom house a month and a<br/>
half before Rain (The Child Formerly Known As Cacie) was born, in the<br/>
older downtown Mesa area. The people living there before us (we lived<br/>
half a block down before we loved there, so we knew them) had a mama dog<br/>
and a whole litter of puppies, and they didn&#39;t seem very well-taken care<br/>
of (dog poop not picked up, mama dog&#39;s coat messy, etc.). So, since there<br/>
was a two week overlap between when we had to leave our old place and<br/>
move in to the new one (which we rented for $325 a month, BTW, and it had<br/>
great front and back yards) we steam-cleaned and scrubbed and then Dave<br/>
chemically de-fleaed the whole place, just in case...<br/>
<br/>
The day we were moving in, we went home to get a load of stuff and came<br/>
back and two of the puppies were in our yard! We  freaked out for an hour<br/>
or so (we had two cats and a dog of our own) and finally found out that<br/>
the people who had lived in our house had left these puppies with the<br/>
neighbors, saying they would be back to pick them up, but had never<br/>
returned, so the neighbors decided that they would just &quot;return&quot; them. <br/>
Arggh. We finally got them to take them back and drive them to the animal<br/>
shelter, but the damage was apparently done... our cats and dog had fleas<br/>
the whole damn time we lived there, 6 months, despite dipping and<br/>
spraying and everything we could think of that wouldn&#39;t be too toxic for<br/>
a baby. I even found a flea on my baby at one point. It was awful. I<br/>
think this was before Advantage, which would have helped...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we packed up and moved to Chandler (not because of the fleas,<br/>
although it was nice to get away from them) and dipped all the critters<br/>
as we left, and they didn&#39;t reoccur...but I&#39;ve known other Phoenicians<br/>
who had fleas, and ticks, too... when my parenst lived in the Tucson<br/>
foothills sitting and de-ticking dogs was a nightly ritual, although they<br/>
never had fleas...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-186309653">Well, if there&#39;s bubonic plague, there are fleas. It&#39;s a bacteria in rat<br/>
fleas, and that&#39;s how it&#39;s spread. Hanta virus is airborne from mouse<br/>

<br/>
However, higher elevations don&#39;t have very many fleas or mosquitos either<br/>
one. And for some reason, I&#39;ve never seen a scorpion, even though I&#39;ve lived<br/>
in central and North Texas, and SW and central Oklahoma all my life.<br/>
Rattlers, centipedes, stinging caterpillars, fleas, ticks, mosquitos, every<br/>
kind of wasp, bee, hornet, and yellowjacket there is, but no scorpions. It&#39;s<br/>
a charmed life, what can I say?<br/>

  &lt;&lt; NO FLEAS   where exactly was this? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  New Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
  I get flea bits in California.  With one friend, I had them from riding in<br/>
  her car where she carried her saddle blanket and riding boots and<br/>
suchlike.<br/>
  Last time I was there, I either got one from a dog or the carpet maybe.<br/>
One<br/>
  fleabite.  I kept looking at it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I think because they&#39;ve been so rare in my life (fleas) I have a worse<br/>
  reaction to them than I might if they were normal around where I live.<br/>
<br/>
  We don&#39;t have scorpions from Albuquerque on north.  When I was little I<br/>
lived<br/>
  in Fort Worth, Texas, and they were around in the house.  I stepped on<br/>
one.<br/>
  It itched like a new bite for two or three days.  Right in the arch of my<br/>
  foot.  Yuck!<br/>
<br/>
  After that the only scorpion I saw in Espanola (north of Santa Fe) was one<br/>
my<br/>
  dad caught in the back of a truck that had come to his place of work from<br/>
  Texas.  So he brought it for us to look at, but it was not a native New<br/>
  Mexican.<br/>
<br/>
  I know that in the south of the state there are some, but not in the north<br/>
as<br/>
  far as I&#39;ve ever seen or heard.<br/>
<br/>
  What we do have that&#39;s bad is rare but real:  bubonic plague and hunta<br/>
virus<br/>
  Both have to do with rodents.  But now the doctors here are on them, and<br/>
can<br/>
  catch them early.  If you pass through New Mexico, tell the kids not to<br/>
touch<br/>
  any dead rodents, and not to reach into the nests of deermice.  That<br/>
should<br/>
  make them safe enough.<br/>

with them, but have never had a problem with my own.   I believe the<br/>
winters are too cold for flea eggs to survive.   <br/>
There are about two weeks in spring when the ticks are bad, not bad like<br/>
they are in the south, but bad enough, and after that they are not much<br/>
of a problem.   We hike and take the dog and she&#39;s never had a tick.   <br/>
Not much problem with heart worm here, yet.  <br/>
Montana has had a few, maybe six? cases of Haunta virus.  Mostly folks<br/>
cleaning out old barns, etc.  <br/>
There was a plague outbreak in a prairie dog community last year or the<br/>
year before in eastern MT, but I don&#39;t remember any human cases.  <br/>
The big scare this year is West Nile virus, expected at least as far<br/>
north and west as South Dakota, but we are told to be watchful here in<br/>
MT. <br/>

&lt;&lt; Well, if there&#39;s bubonic plague, there are fleas. It&#39;s a bacteria in rat<br/>
fleas, &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It was in europe in the Middle Ages, but here it&#39;s fleas on dead rodents in <br/>
the mountains.<br/>
<br/>
There might be fleas on dead rodents in the mountains (and they&#39;re not rats, <br/>
they&#39;re mice and prairie dogs and ground squirrels), but they&#39;re not healthy <br/>
and roaming the world, and the&#39;re not in town as far as I can tell.<br/>
<br/>
NO doubt vets and the animal shelter know a lot of fleas personally, but <br/>
because of the dryness and scatteredness of all the mammals (much more empty <br/>
space than people or animals) the fleas aren&#39;t happy and healthy here as they <br/>
seem to be in some other places.<br/>
<br/>
Rats are not at all common here either.  I&#39;ve never seen one in my life (not <br/>
counting pet stores) and never known anyone who had any in a home or barn.  <br/>
Mice, lots.  Rats, no.  Probably exterminators know some personally, but I <br/>
never have known anyone to know of any in New Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
Plague is very rare, a handful of cases a year.  If untreated it can turn to <br/>
pneumonic plague, which can then be passed airborne.  That&#39;s the level which <br/>
caused it to kill so many people in the Middle Ages.  They didn&#39;t have to all <br/>
get it from fleas individually.  Once some people were to they about-to-die <br/>
stage they could just cough it all over each other.<br/>

We are in Oregon now, fleas still a problem but we use Advantage and<br/>
agree that it&#39;s close to a miracle.  We also use a spray called Knock<br/>
Out, works wonders and fairly safe for the kiddos being made from<br/>

months out of the year.<br/>
