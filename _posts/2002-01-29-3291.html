parks to see the wildlife in person when my children are older.  That scene<br/>
was incredible and about the last thing I would have expected on Survivor.  <br/>
I think it was a wildebeest that fed the lions that day.<br/>
<br/>
I also think that they did more to show what life in Africa was like<br/>
this time.  I also applaud their decision to sell memorabilia on E-Bay<br/>
and donate the proceeds to African Aids charities.<br/>
