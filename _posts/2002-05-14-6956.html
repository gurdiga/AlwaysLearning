<div id="ygrps-yiv-554829901">Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Mary, mom to Riley 5 Ashley 7.5 and tessa 2.5. Lately at our house <br/>
Ashley won&#39;t get dressed. Seems she needing the attention, again. Can&#39;t I <br/>
get it right with this kid! Anyhow, she is complaining about seams and <br/>
wrinkles...Not very fun every morning. She has decided to wear a swimsuit <br/>
for underwear, so my question, does anyone see any problem here with wearing <br/>
a swimsuit day in and day out? She has 3 of them and I am keeping up with <br/>
washing as best I can. She is sleeping in them too. Hasn&#39;t touched her <br/>
dresser drawers for weeks now. She has 2 dresses she wears, that&#39;s it.<br/>
<br/>
Question 2: Someone on the list asked about books for body awareness. Ashley <br/>
stopped me yesterday with a light bulb question, Mommy, do you and Daddy.... <br/>
to have a baby? So even though I felt I&#39;m not in need of any such books yet, <br/>
I&#39;m thinking I need to do some research for myself about talking to kids <br/>
about reproduction.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m Rebecca, mom to Ashley 12.5, Jennifer 9, Nathan 4 and Kris 1 (2 in June). I found that with my girls letting them make their own &quot;fashion&quot; choices works best. That is as long as it is appropriate for the occasion. My oldest dd used to give me a really hard time about her clothes too. Everything had to be &quot;just so&quot; or she wouldn&#39;t wear it. So, I started letting her pick her own clothes out when we shop, again within reason. I made a few rules, that were to me reasonable limits. Some were, no 2 piece bathing suits, no short shorts, not sleeveless shirts. Just things that were important to me. The rest is for her to decide. I also let both girls wear what is comfortable around the house, except our house rule is, everyone must be dressed.... : )<br/>
<br/>
I think, if you let her wear the bathing suit, and don&#39;t make a big deal out of it, you will find that she will give it up on her own. I would let her know that when you go out, she must choose something other than the bathing suit. I have found with my girls that the more I try to interfere the more they fight me.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this is helpful,<br/>
<br/>

was worried:)  Of course no one else is up yet so I have freedom. My older<br/>
kids don&#39;t wander around naked anymore but always used to until about 9 or<br/>
10. Now the boys hang out in their boxer shorts and t-shirt. Ben (7)<br/>
refuses to wear underwear or shirt in the house so just wears comfy shorts.<br/>
Often they will also wear dishdashas (the Arabic men&#39;s long white<br/>
&quot;dresses&quot;) as they are really comfy.<br/>

<br/>
Not if it&#39;s not too tight.  It won&#39;t last forever.<br/>
<br/>
I have to have all the tags taken out of my clothes or they distract me or <br/>
hurt me or both.  If I try to ignore a tag, I end up with a little rash or a <br/>
raw place.<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s the same way.  Her brothers aren&#39;t; my husband isn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t wear anything with nylon thread in a seam.  Some polyester causes <br/>
skin irritation.   I can&#39;t wear wool.  Nylon is bothersome (like nylon <br/>
nightclothes--I gave up years ago--i can never relax).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s possible your daughter&#39;s that way too.<br/>

In the summers I often use (well, used to, until the<br/>
last year or so.....I&#39;m 52 now) swim suits for<br/>
underwear, too. Why not? Don&#39;t have to worry about<br/>
what is showing, and if the water is inviting..... I<br/>
used to use the top of the swim suit as outer wear,<br/>
too.  If my body still fit me properly, I would wear<br/>
these lovely tank tops with the built in bras. <br/>
<br/>
When I was little I wore a little cotton, pull on<br/>
thingy, similar to a swim suit, only it had elastic<br/>
legs, waiste, and tied on the shoulders.  It was easy<br/>
to pull on something over it to go anywear.  <br/>
<br/>
Have you thought about those adorable pull over<br/>
dresses out of tee shirt knits? There are some really<br/>
cute....and comfortable ones.  Or just some tees and<br/>
gathered skirts or light cotton capris to pull on over<br/>
the swim suit to go places. Leotards work well, too,<br/>
as play clothes....they lend themselves to imagination<br/>
so well (basis for costumes)<br/>

on, first.  That would be getting it right with her.<br/>
<br/>
Also, another alternative might be exercise-wear.  Spandex bike shorts <br/>
and little work-out bras...I know they make those little soft bras for <br/>
little girls.  <br/>
<br/>
My 17 yo went about 3 weeks wearing the same shirt and shorts to school <br/>
every day when he was about 7.  I taught him how to use the washing <br/>
machine, and he washed them every night.  After that 3 week stint, he <br/>
still wore them a LOT, but not every day.  He still wears much of the <br/>
same things day in and day out, but he&#39;s more concerned about hygiene <br/>
now, and at least wears a clean shirt and undies every day.  <br/>

sock &quot;bumps&quot;. Her mom spent at least an extra fifteen minutes most <br/>
mornings trying to find the perfect pair of socks for the little girl <br/>

clothing: sock &quot;bumps&quot;, seams, wrinkles, that sort of thing. My <br/>
sister-in-law felt a little better about the situation when she read <br/>
that. Her daughter grew out of it eventually.<br/>

I bet she didn&#39;t really grow out of it.  I bet she just grew into the ability <br/>
to arrange her OWN socks around her toes and within her shoes, choose less <br/>
bumpy socks from the store, cut her own tags out, etc.<br/>
<br/>
If I have cheap socks and a toe-seam gets to pressing against me, I am so <br/>
aware of it I have no option but to go somewhere and rearrange my sock before <br/>
I can function.<br/>
<br/>
I never have to discuss it with people because I can do it myself now. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

If I ever have to have other people buy my socks and put them on it will be a <br/>
factor again.<br/>

That&#39;s what I was thinking too.  Too much nylon plus sweat. Or if the elastic <br/>
is too tight on shoulders or leg openings it could just cut circulation off <br/>
enough to be unconsciously irritating and not as healthy as a looser suit <br/>
would be.<br/>

(like more than a few hours).  You could pick out some cotton <br/>
swimsuits, leotards, or workout clothes if you&#39;re concerned about <br/>
her vaginal health.  Then it would be just like wearing cotton <br/>
underwear!<br/>
Also, have you read &#39;Raising Your Spirited Child&#39; by Mary Sheedy <br/>
Kurcinka.  I know there&#39;s a section about kids that are extra <br/>
sensitive to how clothing feels (like tags, seams, etc.).  She has <br/>
also written another book to do with older kids, something about <br/>
power struggles, I think.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1153646022">I have two daughters, 9.5 and 4....and I have to<br/>
ask...What&#39;s the big deal?  Kids, like *all* people,<br/>
should wear what they like and feel comfortable in. <br/>
Regardless of what they chose.  Most often in our<br/>
house, that means naked or various stages of<br/>
undress--like JUST wool socks, or a sweatshirt and<br/>
that&#39;s all....We&#39;re still working out the idea behind<br/>
when it&#39;s going to be a problem NOT to wear<br/>
clothes...Not a hard and fast rule.  We like to hike<br/>
naked, go swimming naked, go on outings with the<br/>
naturist society...so there are many times when we are<br/>
out and about naked, too...We know the days our<br/>
neighbors work, so we can feel free-er in our<br/>
yard...I&#39;m rambling a lot here, but I guess what I&#39;m<br/>
saying is--a swimming suit?  Yeah, Ok....<br/>

&gt; dresser drawers for weeks now. She has 2 dresses she<br/>
&gt; wears, that&#39;s it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Question 2: Someone on the list asked about books<br/>
&gt; for body awareness. Ashley <br/>
&gt; stopped me yesterday with a light bulb question,<br/>
&gt; Mommy, do you and Daddy.... <br/>
&gt; to have a baby? So even though I felt I&#39;m not in<br/>
&gt; need of any such books yet, <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m thinking I need to do some research for myself<br/>
&gt; about talking to kids <br/>
&gt; about reproduction.<br/>

<br/>
Sarongs and Sari&#39;s are nice and comfy for the not so naked moments, not<br/>
as snug as a swimsuit.  Sari&#39;s are lovely to garden in ( when your not<br/>
naked ) because you have a built in sling for carrying salad stuff back<br/>
to the house.    <br/>

I remember whole summers naked in West Yellowstone...  West Yellowstone&#39;s<br/>
changed some since those days. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-489275727">I had a toe-seam problem yesterday and had to go get a bandaid to put on my toes<br/>
before I could finish getting dressed.<br/>

&gt; I never have to discuss it with people because I can do it myself now. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt; If I ever have to have other people buy my socks and put them on it will be a<br/>
