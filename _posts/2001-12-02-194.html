<div id="ygrps-yiv-1796869507">I&#39;m looking for monologues for children, 7yo girl to be exact, for an audition. Does anyone have any idea if there is anything on the net? We have a great reference library, not too far away, but I was sure I could find something here, until I started looking. <br/>
