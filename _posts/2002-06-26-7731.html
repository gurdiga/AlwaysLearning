<div id="ygrps-yiv-454812350">CLINGING TO THE PAST ELECTRONICALLY!<br/>
<br/>
Dear Always Learning friends,<br/>
<br/>
I had a really strong feeling when I got this e-mail.  I kind of hundred-year <br/>
revulsion.  But I read more and I&#39;m thinking of ordering it, as a souvenir of <br/>
how weird this homeschooling movement could really get.  I guess I could <br/>
order just the sample, but maybe I want the whole thing.<br/>
<br/>
I used to have a couple of the original worn, soft readers that I got at <br/>
garage sales or wherever in the 1960&#39;s, but I passed them on to friends.  <br/>
They are very 19th century.  In the same way some people glorify the early <br/>
1900&#39;s today, many glorified the early 18th century then (especially in &quot;the <br/>
South&quot;) and so now electronically this nostalgia and claw-hold on the past as <br/>
&quot;right&quot; is being perpetuated.  I&#39;m fascinated.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;m just wrong and they ARE great books.  There are great sets of <br/>
writings from the past that are worth maintaining and passing on.  Even in <br/>
the SCA, things I wrote many years ago are still passed on and probably will <br/>
be after I&#39;m gone.  It&#39;s what authoring and publication are ideally about.   <br/>
<br/>
Any contributions to my mindswirl are welcome.  And below is the <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-554140942">I looked at the page.   <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the Christian version.<br/>
It&#39;s the Millenium edition.<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s not (seems) the real original thing, but a modern Christian version <br/>
of the real thing. <br/>
<br/>
And what they show in the samples involves handwriting exercises you print <br/>
off and kids trace, and then it has enough practice lines underneath for them <br/>
to fill up a whole page.  <br/>
<br/>
One good thing is that it&#39;s not 180 lessons a year.  I hope some parents <br/>
don&#39;t look at that and think GREAT!  They can whip through these two a year <br/>
and be done when they&#39;re twelve.<br/>
<br/>
     Primer - 52 lessons - 427 pages<br/>
     First Reader - 63 lessons - 434 pages<br/>
     Second Reader - 71 lessons - 456 pages<br/>
     Third Reader - 79 lessons - 356 pages<br/>
     Fourth Reader - 90 lessons - 413 pages<br/>
     Fifth Reader - 117 lessons - 497 pages<br/>
     Sixth Reader - 138 lessons - 625 pages<br/>
     Total - 610 lessons - 7 books - 3252 pages</div>
