<div id="ygrps-yiv-907257508">I cleverly deleted my post :P but here&#39;s the gist:<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe there is such a thing as &quot;sex addiction&quot;. Yes, I know some<br/>
people do believe in this, but I don&#39;t. Since I don&#39;t believe in it, I don&#39;t<br/>
believe internet porn can cause it. In the same way, I don&#39;t believe that<br/>
viewing pornography causes you (generic you) to go to hell. I know of people<br/>
who believe the opposite.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I might be wrong about either of these non-beliefs, but in the meantime<br/>
I&#39;m no more likely to tell anyone who is looking at internet porn, &quot;you<br/>
could get addicted and ruin your life&quot; than I am to say, &quot;you&#39;re going to<br/>
hell&quot;. To me, they&#39;re both superstitious and nonsensical.<br/>
<br/>
If someone had said seriously in this discussion, &quot;If you, Tia, let your son<br/>
view anything resembling a woman&#39;s naked body you&#39;re consigning his soul to<br/>
hell&quot;, it would make the same amount of sense to me as saying that an<br/>
addiction to sex made someone use the internet as sort of a gateway drug to<br/>
prostitutes.<br/>
<br/>
Annie to Millie in Bull Durham, &quot;You did not get lured, say it, &#39;women do<br/>
not get lured, we are too strong and powerful.&#39;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s not much in the way of &quot;addictions&quot; and &quot;I couldn&#39;t help myselfs&quot;<br/>
that I&#39;m able to buy.<br/>

I do believe in addiction, but I don&#39;t think women become addicted to romance <br/>
novels or mystery series.  I don&#39;t think people become addicted to playing <br/>
Minesweeper, or listening to rock&#39;n&#39;roll, although I think some people <br/>
really, really like those things and do them lots.  And I don&#39;t think <br/>
listening to Led Zeppelin creates an addiction to Arrowsmith or whatever up <br/>
the line.  Maybe Marty&#39;s addicted to Lego--he wants a set of the western <br/>
stuff for his birthday.  THIRTEENTH birthday.  Shouldn&#39;t a boy that age be <br/>
wanting something more...  more...  like a trip to the mall to go to movies <br/>
and look at rude t-shirts?  (Well that was his third choice, and #2, which <br/>
he&#39;s also getting, is to go ice skating with some friends.)  Maybe I should <br/>
never have let him play with ANY Lego, because the set he has chosen out of <br/>
the newly-arrived catalog is not cheap.    But a just-after-Christmas <br/>
birthday shouldn&#39;t be denied just because the Christmas bills haven&#39;t come <br/>
in, and so...    I vote &quot;not an addict.&quot;   And I&#39;m relieved a new teen will <br/>
still pick Lego.<br/>

<br/>
I think the definition of addiction is a bit different.  &quot;Persistent <br/>
compulsive use of a substance known by the user to be harmful. &quot;  Harmful is <br/>
generally defined as damaging self or people/things important to self.<br/>
<br/>
We joke about being addicted to chocolate, to skiing, that sort of thing <br/>
which provides enjoyment.  Persistent compulsive use, it isn&#39;t. <br/>
<br/>
Persistent compulsive use in the face of negative results.  Certainly allows <br/>
for free choice in the matter -- somewhat different from being chemically <br/>
attached to a drug.  Gamblers aren&#39;t addicted, I don&#39;t think, in the chemical <br/>
sense.  But they do gamble persistently and compulsively in the face of <br/>
bankruptcy.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it would be difficult to imagine someone who persistently and <br/>
compulsively spent time with pornography, instead of time with family or <br/>
work.  Doesn&#39;t mean it didn&#39;t happen.  But as I said, gang, I do think MOST <br/>
people do not have problems with addiction in general.  And I&#39;m not saying <br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t view it because you&#39;ll get addicted.&quot;  What I said was it appears SOME <br/>
people have had problems with it.  I wouldn&#39;t say &quot;Don&#39;t drink alcohol <br/>
because you&#39;ll get addicted&quot; either.  Sheesh.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-6973197">To me, this is like saying that my daughter&#39;s many games involving her <br/>
Pokemon and Beanie Babies talking to each other could get in the way of her<br/>
forming real communicative relationships.<br/>
<br/>
Some people do live in fantasy worlds, but I think again the fantasy is the<br/>
symptom, not the cause. Some men are misogynistic or selfish or<br/>
anti-socially shy, and they seem to do better with pin up girls than real<br/>
women, but I think that&#39;s effect, not cause.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think rock and roll makes people kill cops, and I don&#39;t think video<br/>
games make people open fire in public schools. I don&#39;t think television<br/>
turns people&#39;s brains to mush.<br/>
<br/>
When I was growing up in a bad early-teenagehood, I turned to fantasy and<br/>
science fiction for escape. I lived in those worlds much more surely than I<br/>
lived in the real one around me (at least until I was 16 and dog training<br/>
rescued me and I left home). This was not the fault of the fantasy and<br/>
science fiction books lining my shelves.<br/>
<br/>
Just to caveat, I&#39;m not suggesting a, &quot;yes dear, and please, let me buy you<br/>
another Penthouse&quot; attitude. I don&#39;t know that I do have any great<br/>
suggestions, but I&#39;m interested in the part of this conversation on cause<br/>
and effect.<br/>

Survey shows more men addicted to sex online<br/>

REUTERS <br/>
<br/>
January 4, 2002 <br/>
<br/>
About 6.5 percent of male Internet users are compulsive cybersex fans, with<br/>
online fantasy lives so intense that their offline relationships may suffer,<br/>
according to a recent study.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We know a lot of people are using the Internet for sexual activity. We need<br/>
to figure out how people get in trouble with it,&quot; said Dr. Al Cooper of the<br/>
San Jose Marital and Sexuality Centre, who conducted the survey in<br/>
conjunction with MSNBC.<br/>
<br/>
Cooper, who has conducted a series of surveys probing the growing world of<br/>
Internet sex, said his latest study was aimed at identifying those at risk<br/>
for cybersex addiction.<br/>
<br/>
Culling through some 40,000 responses to a poll posted at the MSNBC site,<br/>
Cooper examined a random sample of some 7,000 male respondents and further<br/>
narrowed the group down to 384 who indicated they had problems with online<br/>
sexual activity.<br/>
<br/>
These respondents reported that they engaged in cybersex for an average of<br/>
about 5.7 hours per week, or twice as much time as the rest of the sample.<br/>
<br/>
Spending more hours trolling the Internet&#39;s porn sites and sex chat rooms<br/>
was only one signifier of online sexual compulsion, Cooper said.<br/>
<br/>
Most of those who reported cybersex addiction said they went online to<br/>
relieve stress, rather than for entertainment or sex information.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;People do it again and again and again, instead of running or talking to<br/>
their partner,&quot; Cooper said. &quot;There are alternate ways of relieving stress<br/>
that are probably healthier.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They also said they spent time engaging in cybersexual activities that they<br/>
would never attempt in real life.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;These people go online to do things, whether it&#39;s with animals or<br/>
threesomes or homosexual or whatever -- that they wouldn&#39;t do in their<br/>
offline life,&quot; Cooper said.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;This tends to reinforce a split between their online and offline life,&quot; he<br/>
said. &quot;The Internet can be good in the sense that you can experiment and<br/>
check it out, but if you never resolve it offline, it creates a fantasy life<br/>
that the research finds to be problematic.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Cooper said that most of those respondents who reported signs of cybersex<br/>
compulsion also reported reduced real time sexual activity with an offline<br/>
partner -- further alienating their real and fantasy sex lives.<br/>
<br/>
Some experts have questioned the validity of Cooper&#39;s findings, noting that<br/>
the self-selecting nature of the respondents meant it was not as<br/>
scientifically useful as a true, random poll.<br/>
<br/>
Editors at MSNBC have said they posted the survey because they found it<br/>
interesting, not to obtain hard scientific results.<br/>
<br/>
But Cooper, a psychologist who teaches at Stanford University, said the<br/>
fledgling field of online sexuality studies required new methods of<br/>
gathering data and that Internet polls could reach a much larger and more<br/>
diverse group than traditional surveys.<br/>
<br/>
Cooper said the next survey, due out in several months, would take a broader<br/>
look at cybersex compulsion and would include data from women --<br/>
statistically believed to have a lower rate of &quot;cyber-addiction&quot; than men.<br/>
<br/>
Recent statistics show that between December 1999 and February 2001, the<br/>
number of individual visitors to sexual sites grew by more than 27 percent,<br/>
to nearly 28 million from 22 million. Over the same period, retail sites<br/>
showed growth at less than half that rate.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What we would expect over time is that there is going to be an increase,&quot;<br/>
he said. &quot;Some people convert to problematic Internet usage, and the real<br/>
problem then is that they don&#39;t seem to be able to find their way out of<br/>
it.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
This is another matter, cyber-sex.  They&#39;re not &quot;Doing things&quot; looking at <br/>
porn sites (nothing they couldn&#39;t do with a magazine), but when it&#39;s chat <br/>
room interaction, with someone talking them through like phone sex, that&#39;s <br/>
beyond what the question was about.<br/>
<br/>
There are women who have instant message &quot;affairs&quot; with guys just talking <br/>
dirty, and they talk dirty back.  This has gone on in phone calls, paid and <br/>
volunteer, since before the internet.   That probably would hamper real-life <br/>
sex because of guilt (in the case of marriage) and less of need (for <br/>
attention and stimulation).<br/>
<br/>
But if someone, male or female, is in a relationship that&#39;s lacking and <br/>
they&#39;re going to go looking for attention elsewhere, I think it&#39;s worlds <br/>
better to pretend, alone, still being at home, than to go to bars or clubs.<br/>
<br/>
That it&#39;s convenient makes it easier to return than if it were the bar, but <br/>
there&#39;s also not the pesky problem of hiding from others in your hometown, <br/>
getting diseases, risking pregnancy, getting beat up, driving drunk, leaving <br/>
spouses and kids alone, and all the related issues of screwing around.<br/>
<br/>
And in the case of single, unattached men who weren&#39;t going to have real <br/>
physical relationships anyway?  I don&#39;t see what it hurts.  <br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; Now, I might be wrong about either of these non-beliefs, but in the<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; I&#39;m no more likely to tell anyone who is looking at internet porn, &quot;you<br/>

&gt; REUTERS<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; January 4, 2002<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; About 6.5 percent of male Internet users are compulsive cybersex fans,<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; online fantasy lives so intense that their offline relationships may<br/>
suffer,<br/>
&gt; according to a recent study.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;We know a lot of people are using the Internet for sexual activity. We<br/>
need<br/>
&gt; to figure out how people get in trouble with it,&quot; said Dr. Al Cooper of<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; San Jose Marital and Sexuality Centre, who conducted the survey in<br/>
&gt; conjunction with MSNBC.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Cooper, who has conducted a series of surveys probing the growing world of<br/>
&gt; Internet sex, said his latest study was aimed at identifying those at risk<br/>
&gt; for cybersex addiction.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Culling through some 40,000 responses to a poll posted at the MSNBC site,<br/>
&gt; Cooper examined a random sample of some 7,000 male respondents and further<br/>
&gt; narrowed the group down to 384 who indicated they had problems with online<br/>
&gt; sexual activity.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; These respondents reported that they engaged in cybersex for an average of<br/>
&gt; about 5.7 hours per week, or twice as much time as the rest of the sample.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Spending more hours trolling the Internet&#39;s porn sites and sex chat rooms<br/>
&gt; was only one signifier of online sexual compulsion, Cooper said.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Most of those who reported cybersex addiction said they went online to<br/>
&gt; relieve stress, rather than for entertainment or sex information.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;People do it again and again and again, instead of running or talking to<br/>
&gt; their partner,&quot; Cooper said. &quot;There are alternate ways of relieving stress<br/>
&gt; that are probably healthier.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; They also said they spent time engaging in cybersexual activities that<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; would never attempt in real life.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;These people go online to do things, whether it&#39;s with animals or<br/>
&gt; threesomes or homosexual or whatever -- that they wouldn&#39;t do in their<br/>
&gt; offline life,&quot; Cooper said.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;This tends to reinforce a split between their online and offline life,&quot;<br/>
he<br/>
&gt; said. &quot;The Internet can be good in the sense that you can experiment and<br/>
&gt; check it out, but if you never resolve it offline, it creates a fantasy<br/>
life<br/>
&gt; that the research finds to be problematic.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Cooper said that most of those respondents who reported signs of cybersex<br/>
&gt; compulsion also reported reduced real time sexual activity with an offline<br/>
&gt; partner -- further alienating their real and fantasy sex lives.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Some experts have questioned the validity of Cooper&#39;s findings, noting<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; the self-selecting nature of the respondents meant it was not as<br/>
&gt; scientifically useful as a true, random poll.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Editors at MSNBC have said they posted the survey because they found it<br/>
&gt; interesting, not to obtain hard scientific results.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But Cooper, a psychologist who teaches at Stanford University, said the<br/>
&gt; fledgling field of online sexuality studies required new methods of<br/>
&gt; gathering data and that Internet polls could reach a much larger and more<br/>
&gt; diverse group than traditional surveys.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Cooper said the next survey, due out in several months, would take a<br/>
broader<br/>
&gt; look at cybersex compulsion and would include data from women --<br/>
&gt; statistically believed to have a lower rate of &quot;cyber-addiction&quot; than men.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Recent statistics show that between December 1999 and February 2001, the<br/>
&gt; number of individual visitors to sexual sites grew by more than 27<br/>
percent,<br/>
&gt; to nearly 28 million from 22 million. Over the same period, retail sites<br/>
&gt; showed growth at less than half that rate.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;What we would expect over time is that there is going to be an increase,&quot;<br/>
&gt; he said. &quot;Some people convert to problematic Internet usage, and the real<br/>
&gt; problem then is that they don&#39;t seem to be able to find their way out of<br/>
&gt; it.&quot;<br/>

Prof. Pleas No Contest in Sex Charge<br/>
<br/>
.c The Associated Press<br/>
<br/>
  <br/>
NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - A former Yale University geology professor has <br/>
pleaded no contest to charges that he sexually assaulted a boy during a <br/>
period covering about half of the boy&#39;s 13 years. <br/>
<br/>
Antonio Lasaga, 52, who had served as the boy&#39;s mentor in a New Haven school <br/>
program for children with family problems, entered the plea Friday as his <br/>
state trial was to begin. <br/>
<br/>
Lasaga was arrested in 1998 when federal investigators, acting on a tip, <br/>
searched his apartment and found thousands of child pornography photos and <br/>
videotapes. <br/>
<br/>
The university fired Lasaga last year. <br/>
<br/>
Assistant State&#39;s Attorney David J. Strollo described often graphic evidence <br/>
of Lasaga&#39;s sexual activities that began when the boy was about 6. <br/>
<br/>
The state charges covered by the no-contest plea carry a combined maximum <br/>
penalty of 110 years in prison and include two counts of sexual assault and <br/>
two counts of employing a minor in an obscene performance. <br/>
<br/>
In a plea bargain in federal court, Lasaga admitted possessing child <br/>
pornography and agreed to a sentence of about 20 years. <br/>
<br/>
Sentencing in federal court is set for Jan. 28 and in state court is <br/>
scheduled Feb. 1.</div>

Sex Offenders Monitored by Software<br/>
<br/>
By JOHN O&#39;CONNOR<br/>
.c The Associated Press<br/>
<br/>
  <br/>
SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) - During a seminar on computer software designed to <br/>
monitor children&#39;s Internet use and protect them from sexual predators, Don <br/>
Spurlin wondered if the product couldn&#39;t be turned around to monitor the <br/>
predators themselves. <br/>
<br/>
Spurlin, a probation officer with a caseload full of sex offenders, contacted <br/>
the maker of ``Cyber Sentinel.&#39;&#39; Security Software Systems had never <br/>
considered using the software for law enforcement, but welcomed the idea. <br/>
<br/>
Now tests of the program have worked so well that Spurlin&#39;s Sangamon County <br/>
plans to require the software for computer-using offenders on probation. <br/>
<br/>
``We&#39;re protecting children by preventing the offenders that we know about <br/>
from being able to do the things that they&#39;d like to do,&#39;&#39; Spurlin said. <br/>
<br/>
Cyber Sentinel was developed to record sexually explicit references in <br/>
children&#39;s chat room conversations, instant messages, e-mail messages and <br/>
image exchanges so parents can see what their children are doing online, said <br/>
Dan Jude, president of Sugar Grove-based Security Software. <br/>
<br/>
The program uses a library of offensive and explicit words developed with law <br/>
enforcement agencies, and includes phrases used by offenders, such as ``Do <br/>
your parents use this computer?&#39;&#39; or ``Do you like older men?&#39;&#39; It can be <br/>
customized to spot personal information, such as the child&#39;s school name, <br/>
phone number and address. <br/>
<br/>
The software was tested on four Sangamon County sex offenders who have <br/>
computers. If they go to a prohibited Web site, use sexually explicit <br/>
language or use phrases common to online predators, Spurlin gets an e-mail <br/>
letting him know their probation conditions may have been violated. <br/>
<br/>
``At first, I thought that this is taking everything away from my privacy,&#39;&#39; <br/>
said Jim McIntire, 33, of Springfield, who has been on probation for six <br/>
years for criminal sexual abuse. <br/>
<br/>
``The more I thought about it, the more I realized they&#39;ve got a tight rein <br/>
on me. With this, at least they know I&#39;m on the computer and I&#39;m not out <br/>
doing something different.&#39;&#39; <br/>
<br/>
Other probation offices across the country are using similar programs, said <br/>
Carl Wicklund, executive director of the American Parole and Probation <br/>
Association. <br/>
<br/>
They have obvious benefits but must not replace human contact, Wicklund said. <br/>
<br/>
``If you&#39;re too reliant on any technology, the facts may hide the truth,&#39;&#39; he <br/>
said. <br/>
<br/>
Authorities can customize the list of words or phrases that generate an <br/>
e-mail alert, Jude said. <br/>
<br/>
In McIntire&#39;s case, his computer activity produced nearly 100 alerts in just <br/>
one week. It turned out just to be offensive language McIntire was using <br/>
while playing online card games, so Spurlin removed some of the words from <br/>
his Sentinel library. <br/>
<br/>
The American Civil Liberties Union recognizes that people on probation have <br/>
fewer rights than other citizens, but wants to make sure authorities don&#39;t go <br/>
overboard with the software. <br/>
<br/>
``It&#39;s reasonable for people to want to read articles and even look at <br/>
pictures that have references to sexuality that don&#39;t raise concerns about <br/>
future sex offenses,&#39;&#39; ACLU attorney Benjamin Wolf said. <br/>
<br/>
Security Software has given Sangamon County 100 copies of the $35 program. <br/>
<br/>
County Adult Probation Director Michael Torchia has gotten judicial approval <br/>
to change the probation code to require that future sex offenders on <br/>
probation who have computers use the software.</div>

<br/>
I tried to have that talk with him in the car yesterday.  I asked him what <br/>
he thought about the people who posed on those internet sex sites he likes <br/>
to look at, whether he thought they enjoyed what they were doing.  He <br/>
looked straight at me and said he didn&#39;t go to those sites.  I asked who <br/>
did, because I know *someone* did on December 14.  He said he didn&#39;t <br/>
know.  (Before anyone suggests maybe it was dh, let it be known that dh is <br/>
the original technophobe.  He never touches the computer, wouldn&#39;t know how <br/>
to get online, doesn&#39;t even want to learn how to play a CD on it.)<br/>
<br/>
I just let the lie go and continued on with what *I* wanted to say about <br/>
the people, that they likely didn&#39;t enjoy what they were doing, that they <br/>
might be desperate for money, though it doesn&#39;t pay much, that they might <br/>
have been drugged or even kidnapped, that the pop stars probably had <br/>
someone else&#39;s body pasted onto their heads, that kind of thing.  I got no <br/>
reaction, but at least I had my say.  Have I mentioned that my son is *not* <br/>
a talker?  %^)<br/>
<br/>
I was disappointed about the lying.  We&#39;ve had a lot of trouble with it <br/>
over the years, even though there are no harsh punishments he might need to <br/>
lie to avoid.  WHen he was little, he used to tell me he hadn&#39;t done <br/>
something even when I had watched him do the thing and he *knew* I had <br/>
watched him do it.  I kind of thought we were over that by now, but I guess <br/>
not.  The other night the phone rang quite late and woke me up.  It was a <br/>
fax machine or something.  Lars was still up, and the door to the computer <br/>
room was almost closed, something he usually doesn&#39;t do.  I went towards <br/>
the room to have a peek in, which I often do when he&#39;s in there.  He shut <br/>
the door further.  I asked casually what he was working on, and he said he <br/>
was downloading stuff.  I decided not to call him on the fact that the <br/>
phone wouldn&#39;t have rung if he had really been online.  My take is that it <br/>
was a spur of the moment lie.  (Maybe my original approach to the porn last <br/>
year was too heavy.  Maybe he figures he&#39;s going to get into a lot of <br/>
trouble if he admits it.  I don&#39;t know.)<br/>
<br/>
Rod is going to talk with him, maybe find him some pictures to look <br/>
at.  We&#39;ll see how it plays out.<br/>
