         Freedom-in-Education Newsletter<br/>
<br/>
 May 2006<br/>
<br/>
 The full version can be seen on-line at:<br/>

<br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
  The July Newsletter is about television, an interesting topic as yet <br/>
uncovered by Freedom-in-Education. Television is a major issue in most <br/>
families: when to watch it, what to watch, how long to watch it for, or <br/>
if one should watch it at all.<br/>
I do believe that television is slightly addictive - and this is as <br/>
true for adults as is it is for children. Once one has sat oneself down <br/>
to watch it, even if there is nothing interesting on, it becomes hard <br/>
to turn it off again, and I know that I will usually end up watching <br/>
things which are not only a terrible waste of time, but also put images <br/>
in my head which I could really do without!<br/>
<br/>
  It is quite clear that when a child is young television has a huge <br/>
effect on them. If one stops to talk to a child nearly everything they <br/>
say is copying an advert they heard, or imitating something they saw on <br/>
television. The sights and sounds seem to fill their world, and the <br/>
reason they are running round with toy guns pretending to blow each <br/>
other up is usually due to something they saw on television. It is no <br/>
wonder, then, that parents often try to protect their children from <br/>
this as much as they can, and I think that in general this is a good <br/>
idea. <br/>
<br/>
  When I was young I don&#39;t remember there being a television around, and <br/>
when I was a little older, we had a television but I would never watch <br/>
it without my parent&#39;s permission, - it was usually pretty boring <br/>
anyway. When I was about ten or eleven I went through a phase of <br/>
watching cartoons on television every day, and soon discovered that it <br/>
never left me feeling very good. The adverts aimed at children for <br/>
toys, sweets, junky drinks, and disgusting cereals were really quite <br/>
shocking, and the gross noisy way in which the channel was supposed to <br/>
appeal to children I found highly offensive, and not at all suited to <br/>
my tastes.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes in other people&#39;s houses I would catch glimpses of the news <br/>
which would fill me with a dread and horror of television which can&#39;t <br/>
easily be described. I still remember how deeply appalled I was, when I <br/>
saw pictures of people who were dead and wounded being shown, whilst <br/>
adults were casually eating their dinner. These shots would instantly <br/>
reduce me to tears, and make me feel far too sick to eat, but to them <br/>
it was considered an appropriate meal-time accompaniment!<br/>
<br/>
  I am still shocked when I see murders being coolly discussed by the <br/>
news presenters without reducing them to tears, and after having <br/>
announced the deaths of so many people they put a cheery smile on their <br/>
faces and say &#39;now time for the sport&#39;. I don&#39;t think anyone is aware <br/>
of the damage that television must do, putting ideas into people&#39;s <br/>
heads that they would not otherwise have, hardening people in an area <br/>
where they should not be hardened, and turning terrible tragedy into <br/>
idle entertainment.<br/>
<br/>
  So I really don&#39;t think that television is the main culprit, but <br/>
rather what is shown on it. If television showed things which were as <br/>
good as things they now show are bad, then television could become a <br/>
wonderful thing which inspired people and left them feeling better. One <br/>
does occasionally see a good programme which shows one that this is the <br/>
case. But even then to watch it in moderation is probably still a good <br/>
idea, especially as regards children. After all, as Dad says in the <br/>
article below, television only stimulates a child&#39;s brain, whereas <br/>
ideally children should be able to learn whilst feeling and touching <br/>
and moving and interacting at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
 Anyway, I hope you enjoy the article.<br/>
<br/>

 Television: Junk Food for the Mind<br/>
<br/>
  This is an article that I wrote about fifteen years ago, but never had <br/>
published. I come across it from time to time when tidying up my <br/>
office, and thought perhaps that it deserved a wider audience. The <br/>
title, in particular, is popular with members of my family. I hope that <br/>
it does not come across as a rant against television, but rather as a <br/>
reminder that, like other aspects of modern technology, one has to be <br/>
careful about how one introduces children to television.<br/>
<br/>
  A few years ago parents who gave their children healthy food were <br/>
often considered to be kill-joys and cranks. Now, everyone, from the <br/>
medical profession to people working in the food industry recognises <br/>
that a diet of crisps and fizzy drinks is bad for children’s health and <br/>
increases the risk of contracting life-threatening ailments in later <br/>
life: everyone now agrees that the body is designed in such a way that <br/>
it requires a constant supply of nutritious food over the first <br/>
eighteen or so years of life if it is to grow and develop properly, and <br/>
that a junk food diet does not supply those needs.<br/>
<br/>
  What is true for the body is even more true for the mind. A human <br/>
being is one of the most complex things in Nature, taking longer to <br/>
reach maturity than just about any other animal. This long period of <br/>
development is required principally not by the body, but by the mind, <br/>
which starts off blank and proceeds to acquire vast amounts of <br/>
information and knowledge as a child grows up.<br/>
<br/>
  In order to acquire this knowledge the mind needs constant sensory <br/>
stimulation, and this stimulation needs to be constantly maintained <br/>
over a long period of time. The natural world provides a child with <br/>
ever-changing, dynamic stimulation, of almost infinite variety, <br/>
compared to which the experience of watching television is sadly <br/>
lacking. Instead of having a multi-dimensional experience of sight, <br/>
sound, taste, smell, touch and an interaction with another responsive <br/>
human being, a child sitting in front of a television screen is largely <br/>
inactive, is having only the senses of sight and sound stimulated, and <br/>
is being given no chance to respond.<br/>
<br/>
  To the developing mind this is equivalent to sensory deprivation, and <br/>
whilst the odd hour of watching television can be accommodated in the <br/>
midst of an otherwise full life, a child who spends a significant <br/>
proportion of their time watching television is inevitably missing out <br/>
on the stimulation and input that they require in order to develop <br/>
normally.<br/>
<br/>
  The problem is compounded by the fact that the input that children <br/>
receive from television is not equally deficient in all aspects: <br/>
children receive intense visual and audio input – which fills their <br/>
heads with sights and sounds – whilst other senses are not stimulated <br/>
at all. This seems to have a detrimental effect on children’s power of <br/>
imagination.<br/>
<br/>
  The nature of the programmes watched gives further cause for concern. <br/>
It is often said that even though there are some programmes that are <br/>
not very good, this is compensated for to a certain extent by the fact <br/>
that there are thoughtful documentaries, drama programmes, and <br/>
educational programmes available for children to watch, which represent <br/>
a more acceptable face of television. Interestingly, in the early days <br/>
of television there do appear to have been more of these sorts of <br/>
programmes, but television has become a victim of its own shortcomings: <br/>
children brought up on television do not have the attention span, the <br/>
language skills, or the level of understanding required to appreciate <br/>
thought-provoking or subtle broadcasting, and therefore producers of <br/>
children’s television have had to make their programmes ever more <br/>
inane, garish, and banal in order to maintain their audience figures.<br/>
<br/>
  Further problems are caused by television advertisements which <br/>
essentially seek to sell children products before they are old enough <br/>
to be able to realise that one should not believe everything that one <br/>
sees on a television screen.<br/>
<br/>
  One argument put forward in favour of television is the social <br/>
education that children can get from watching contemporary dramas such <br/>
as soap operas. However, these programmes may, in fact, do even more <br/>
harm than those which more obviously bear no relationship to everyday <br/>
life. A young teenager immersed in a world of television soap operas <br/>
may imagine that they know everything that there is to be known about <br/>
things such as bereavement, drug addiction, relationships, and <br/>
childbirth, but watching actors talking about these things in the <br/>
two-dimensional world of television is far removed from real-life <br/>
experience, and when young people find themselves caught up in these <br/>
situations, they find that they have nothing substantial to fall back <br/>
on if their view of life has been formed by television.<br/>
<br/>
  Of course, television is a factor of modern life and young people have <br/>
to be introduced to it at some time or other: but not necessarily when <br/>
they are very young. Children had enough to keep them fully occupied <br/>
before the advent of modern technology. Things such as acquiring <br/>
language skills, learning social skills, and developing an <br/>
understanding of the natural world are just as important now as they <br/>
ever were and still require as much time to pick up as in the past. <br/>
Television does not help in this process: it distracts children from <br/>
more fruitful activities, it stultifies their imaginations, it <br/>
over-stimulates one area of the mind to the detriment of others, and <br/>
above all it is a waste of precious time.<br/>
<br/>
  The comparison of television with junk food is appropriate because <br/>
just as junk food is designed to look like real food, but fails to <br/>
provide the body with the nourishment that it requires, so television <br/>
appears to be interesting and informative, but in reality fails to <br/>
provide children with the level of stimulation that they require.<br/>

<br/>
Not for me either. I only ever watch TV when I plan to watch something in particular. Very occassionally I might turn it on without a plan but usually nothing of interest is found so off it goes. I find background noise really hard to handle so our TV is only on when someone is watching it for the purpose of watching it.<br/>
<br/>
I agree, Sandra, that people who are sucked into the TV even though they&#39;re not interested in the shows must be totally bored out of their brains!<br/>

to be able to watch for any length of time, even if I&#39;m facinated. <br/>
Morgan often has a project or game going while she has the tv on, <br/>
too. The one time I will see her sit and watch sort-of obsessively <br/>
is if there is a person around that she doesn&#39;t want to interact <br/>
with. That&#39;s a whole different scenario, though. Actually, that&#39;s a <br/>
thought: maybe its easier for some people to believe they <br/>
are &quot;slightly addicted&quot; to tv rather than admit that they are <br/>
disatisfied with their lives or partners and are using the tv as an <br/>
avoidance mechanism.....hmmmmm, armchair psycology is so much fun ;)<br/>

<br/>
NO DOUBT little kids in those days had toy swords and ran around  <br/>
yelling &quot;INFIDELS!&quot; or &quot;You have to be York this time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When I was little we played WWII at school.  I remember once in  <br/>
second grade, I was a nurse and a boy I really liked was &quot;killed by  <br/>
the Japanese&quot; and I revived him by sprinkling a handful of sand over  <br/>
his body.   In retrospect, it was a resurrection battle with team  <br/>
tactics, and we were acting out what the adults in our lives had  <br/>
experienced and talked about.    We were learning who played fair,  <br/>
and who was quick and clever in our group.  Good young-primate  <br/>
behavior.    The building my second grade classroom was in was an old  <br/>
army barracks too.  I talked to Holly recently about how Quanset huts  <br/>
and Army barracks were commonly used as cheap buildings after the  <br/>
war, and barracks could be purchased and moved.  That building was  <br/>
made more permanent and plastered over, and few would&#39;ve known it had  <br/>
been a barracks, because gradually over the years the windows were  <br/>
replaced, the inside walls were panelled, and the outside was  <br/>
stuccoed all the way to the ground.  By the time it was the art and  <br/>
music building and people too young  to have been in WWII were having  <br/>
kids, the memory was gone.<br/>
<br/>
We played cops and robbers too.  At home we played Tarzan and Jane on  <br/>
the swingset, and there would be alligators or tigers on the ground  <br/>
so we had to stay up on the crossbars and only cross with swings.   <br/>
THAT came from watching Tarzan movies on TV.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1317708807">Television is a wonderful educational tool if use as material to be used for analysis and criticism and I will definetely will use it for that purpose with my boys. In fact, TV has been the starter of  many educational conversations between my husband and I, and I hope our children can join us soon since the constructive use of the&quot;caja tonta&quot;, silly box like my mom likes to call it, can be very enriching. However, the passive use of it, , like many of people I know use it, it is detrimental.<br/>
   Our boys are almost 5 and 2. They are August kids. My oldest was in Special Ed in the public school pre-school  for an year since his speech is pretty immature if we compare him with other kids his age.We did not know better before, but we have learnt a lot from the experience. Terrible mistake to put him there, he lost his spontaneity, happiness, self steem...but wonderful thing it happened so it force me to consider homeschooling and us to learn to value and cherish the uniqueness of every single person. Differnt, of course. So, what?<br/>
  By the way, I love TV it as a pacifier sometimes, ja, ja, ja.<br/>
   <br/>
  All the best,<br/>
  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1617532198">I just can share my personal opinion about TV and why it is so, but I am not making any general statement regarding people who enjoy it. I know some very passive people who love it, watch it a lot, and believe eveything they hear from it. The TV might affect people differently depending on the receptors&#39; citical or uncrtical typeof mind.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>   I don&#39;t think TV is addictive in the same sense as cigarettes or<br/>
other drugs. When you find a show you like you want to watch more of<br/>
it, just like when you find a food you like you want to eat more of<br/>
it. Of course prettymuch anything done in excess is going to cause<br/>
problems but few reasonable people eat a food they like until they&#39;re<br/>
sick and if they do it once they will probably learn from their<br/>
mistake. Anyhow I wanted to share what appears to happen in our house.<br/>
My son usually watches something closely the first time, if he doesn&#39;t<br/>
watch it closely it&#39;s obviously not that interesting and he usually<br/>
does something else while watching or just watches something else. If<br/>
it was interesting he will usually watch it again but this time we<br/>
pick out stuff that we didn&#39;t see the first time or he would like to<br/>
find out more about, the second showing usually brings more<br/>
conversation about the show that just watching it once. Somtimes it<br/>
gets watched even a 3rd or more times but usually not as closely or<br/>
while doing something else, sometimes really interesting stuff gets<br/>
watched until it&#39;s almost memorized. <br/>
  We rented Doogle last week (my son is 8) and it got 3 viewings. The<br/>
first one we all watched thourally and then not as closely for the<br/>
later views, sometimes fast forwarding to the good parts like the<br/>
train in mine scene. There are many comments in the movie where they<br/>
refer to other movies, even Thomas the Tank engine got a remark. That<br/>
brought about so much discussion about why the other shows were<br/>
referred to other than just the main themes of the movie.<br/>
  We watch D&D on Disney late Saturday nights which was make several<br/>
years ago. Last episode they make a Star Wars reference and being that<br/>
my son is a big Star Wars fan he was elated and of course I had to<br/>
point out that it would have been a reference from what is now<br/>
episodes 4 or 5 but was 1 or 2 when the show was originally played. <br/>
  My son sat through the whole King King movie (DVD rental)becuase he<br/>
wanted to which I thought was pretty amazing, but it didn&#39;t get a<br/>
second viewing from him and he didn&#39;t talk much about it afterwards.<br/>
Hoodwinked however was probably watched 4 times before it got returned<br/>
(I think I watched it 3X myself!) and he has made references back to<br/>
it.     <br/>
    So for us TV or movies give us lots of connections and discussion<br/>
starters and it is usually on in our house although a lot of the time<br/>
it&#39;s just background noise like a radio on playing music while we do<br/>
other things. I know I personally really enjoy how to and shows that<br/>
tour factories that show how things are made but I know there are more<br/>
importatnt things in live so I think my son will able to easily see<br/>
the same thing. Barbara</div>

In light of the purpose of this list, it&#39;s a good idea for parents to  <br/>
help their children to live discerningly, and to develop critical  <br/>
thinking skills.  Avoiding situations in which they might have to do  <br/>
some real analytical thinking doesn&#39;t help them become better thinkers.<br/>
<br/>
The advantages parents have reported of sharing experiences with  <br/>
children (all kinds, but including TV and movies) are deeper and  <br/>
broader than any unschooler I know had ever imagined might happen.<br/>

<br/>
Starting when?  If it&#39;s a tool you plan to use in the future, what&#39;s  <br/>
happening with it now?<br/>
<br/>
To call it an idiot box in any language is too judgmental.  The worst  <br/>
thing about declaring something &quot;stupid&quot; (a book, or a style of  <br/>
music, or a hobby, or television) is that by extension, anyone who  <br/>
doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s stupid must then feel stupid.  It can cause a  <br/>
child to choose between mom and a skateboard, or mom and rock&#39;n&#39;roll,  <br/>
or whatever.   It&#39;s better to be their partners than their  <br/>
adversaries.  Relationships are primary for unschooling to work, and  <br/>
if it&#39;s all on the mom&#39;s terms, the child becomes powerless.<br/>
<br/>
  Your children cannot make a neutral, personal decision about  <br/>
something you&#39;ve declared &quot;tonta.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Words have power.  Words show thought and belief.<br/>
<br/>
-=-In fact, TV has been the starter of many educational conversations  <br/>
between my husband and I-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Educational&quot; is another of those words that will keep you from  <br/>
sliding straight to happy unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Learning is everywhere, even in conversations that aren&#39;t &quot;educational.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-but wonderful thing it happened so it force me to consider  <br/>
homeschooling and us to learn to value and cherish the uniqueness of  <br/>
every single person.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Uniqueness I understand.  &quot;August kid&quot; is a term I don&#39;t know.  I&#39;m  <br/>
not asking for a definition or explanation, just pointing out that  <br/>
you&#39;ve labelled him something (something which his brother also is,  <br/>
you say) in the same paragraph you assure us you care about uniqueness.<br/>
<br/>
It might seem like I&#39;m picking on you, but it might&#39;ve been better if  <br/>
you&#39;d read the list a few days before writing things that aren&#39;t  <br/>
ideal for helping others (or yourself) understand unschooling.  It&#39;s  <br/>
not too late to read a while.<br/>
