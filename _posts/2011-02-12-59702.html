<div id="ygrps-yiv-1312462876">I am on a mothering board on which there is a discussion going on about radical unschooling.  Several of the women there have read about radical unschooling and been in some groups and email lists (not sure which ones, though possibly this one.)  I posted a snapshot of a part of our day and was told that I could not possibly be a radical unschooler because I don&#39;t let my children throw rocks at people among other things.  Unfortunately they seem to have gotten the impression, from whatever unschoolers they read about, that to do anything other than let your children do whatever they want is not radical unschooling.  I know that Sandra and the moderators of this list do not feel that way, but I am curious what you all *would* say about what I posted there.  With your permission, I would like to share it on the other board as well, or if you could send me to one of your links that would be fitting, that would be great.  <br/>
<br/>
This is what I posted:<br/>
________________<br/>
You have made it clear that you are trying to break away from radical unschooling, so I won&#39;t try to make any suggestions since you have probably heard them all from the unschooling groups. I will just share what we do and how it works here, to be a voice of the other side both for you and anyone else who might be reading.<br/>
<br/>
We are radical unschoolers, which means that like other unschoolers we recognize that children are hard wired to learn, but unlike other unschoolers, we extend that belief to include not only academic subjects, but the rest of life. We do not have arbitrary rules, bed times, food restrictions, tv restrictions etc.<br/>
<br/>
We do NOT do TCS or any other form of non-coersive parenting. TCS is about never saying no. Radical unschooling is about learning and relationships.<br/>
<br/>
I will tell you a little about our day today, so you can see how it works here. We went for a hike and dd2 wanted to wear her red sparkly shoes, which are not very good for climbing in. So, we brought her tennis shoes with us. When we got there, I noticed that it was not muddy (so the sparkly shoes would not get ruined) and that the trail was flat walking not hard climbing, so her shoes would probably be fine. Dh went ahead and suggested to her that she change into her tennis shoes, which she did.<br/>
<br/>
We came to a part with a creek and a bridge and a big hill behind it. Dh took dd1 up the hill while I took dd2 on the bridge. She wanted to go down to the water. A TCS parent might be afraid to say no to this request either because of the potential meltdown or because of a belief that saying no might hinder their child&#39;s development. I do not fear saying no, but I said yes, out of a desire to facilitate learning and because I was enjoying exploring with her.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, like any 2.5 year old, she wanted to get IN the water. I do not have a &quot;rule&quot; about getting wet on hikes. I do have the common sense to recognize that we did not bring any extra clothes and it is cold out. So, I explained that to her and said that she could not get in, but she could touch it with her hands. We climbed around the bank, on the rocks and under the bridge. I helped her lean in to put her hands in and lay on the rocks on her tummy so she could reach further out. I realized right before we were done, that she was doing a little experiment: Is the water cold where it&#39;s moving fast? Is it still cold where it&#39;s still? Is it cold by this rock? Is it still cold on the other side of the creek?<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, dh was letting dd1 throw rocks off the top of the hill. Some parents have a standing rule about never throwing rocks. TCS would say that she &quot;needs&quot; to throw rocks and to stop her would be wrong. I don&#39;t agree with either one. Throwing the rocks was fine, until dd2 and I started walking toward them and could have gotten hit. Then dh had her stop for our safety. Radical unschooling is about learning and relationships. Part of having a good relationship is keeping everyone safe. If we need to say no to do that, we don&#39;t hesitate to do so. But we do explain because explanations lead to learning. And if a mutually agreeable solution can be found, for example, if she had asked to throw them the other direction, we would go allow that. However, she stopped without a problem.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s just a brief snapshot of a part of a day, but that is how it works here. I do not fear saying no, but I do believe that children learn best with a lot of yes&#39;s. I give them the freedom to explore, make mistakes and learn about their own bodies, but we don&#39;t live in a vacuum, so I also take into account other people (including myself) and their feelings, property rights, and personal space.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t follow &quot;RU principles,&quot; I follow Biblical principles. I try to make decisions mindfully and thoughtfully, putting our relationship, learning, safety and respect first. I have not given up my parental authority, I just use it to partner with my child and give her as much freedom as I can.<br/>
<br/>
We do not have bed times, but we do help the kids get to sleep at an hour that is reasonable for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
We do not restrict any food or have rules about food, but I do buy healthy foods and talk about why we eat the way we do.<br/>
<br/>
We do not restrict tv, but I do provide lots of other interesting options AND watch shows with them and help them find things they are interested in.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t do any of those things to &quot;be a radical unschooler.&quot; I do them because I have researched, prayed and deeply thought about each thing and slowly implemented it in our own lives. These were thoughtful, mindful decisions, not a full out abandonment of all rules so I could jump on the RU bandwagon. <br/>

<br/>
What you describe sounds very much like what I&#39;ve seen and done myself.  Perhaps <br/>
it&#39;s easier for me to envision what you are saying because I know you and can <br/>
hear your voice and see your mannerisms.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are plenty of people who completely go for the package deal thing.  Not to <br/>
bash the mothering boards, but I&#39;ve seen it there and I&#39;ve not been very <br/>
impressed with what is written and passed on in that forum.  I think what you <br/>
are experiencing is the stuff Sandra has on her site about support... that <br/>

It&#39;s likely the people who are mischaracterizing radical unschooling  <br/>
won&#39;t care what you wrote or what we might add. They&#39;re angry for  <br/>
whatever reason. But what they said gave you the opportunity to put a  <br/>
different picture out there and undoubtedly it&#39;s being read by people  <br/>
who will silently take something from it.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t let the vocal people get you upset. They want you to think they  <br/>
represent everyone but they don&#39;t. The people silently reading are far  <br/>
more numerous.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Emily -- I would suggest that you avoid using &quot;RU&quot; at all. In fact, I <br/>
was one of the first people to use the term &quot;radical unschooling,&quot; but <br/>
I&#39;ve stopped using it.  I wish we could turn back the clock and go back <br/>
to using &quot;radical&quot; only as an occasional adjective, not as if it is <br/>
something completely different than other unschoolers.   And now Dayna <br/>
Martin has appropriated the term and uses it to refer to unschooling <br/>
combined with a belief in the &quot;Law of Attraction.&quot; So it seems like the <br/>
term has a lot of baggage associated with it, these days. I don&#39;t have <br/>
an urge to hang onto it - we don&#39;t need to define ourselves as a <br/>
particular group or subset of unschoolers. I&#39;m feeling about it like I <br/>
do about calling kids, &quot;gifted.&quot; The word is fine when used as part of a <br/>
description - &quot;My son is a gifted writer,&quot; or &quot;My husband is  gifted <br/>
singer.&quot; That&#39;s using the word in a meaningful way as opposed to <br/>
dividing people up between those who are &quot;gifted&quot; and those are are, <br/>
apparently, &quot;ungifted.&quot; I don&#39;t like the term used the way it is <br/>
most-often used, these days. Same with &quot;radical unschooling&quot; because it <br/>
has (erroneously) gotten the connotation of neglectful parenting.<br/>
<br/>
  I used to feel fine about the term &quot;radical&quot; because it has a real <br/>
connotation of taking something to its root and I felt like that&#39;s what <br/>
we were doing when we started applying unschooling principles to more <br/>
basic things like sleep and food, rather than just the the kinds of <br/>
things kids were supposed to learn in school. But, over time, the term <br/>
has come to mean things to a lot of people that we never ever intended - <br/>
and I think it is getting in the way of people even being willing to <br/>
consider the ideas that it (used to) encompass.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of a new term, instead of a new label, I try very hard to simply <br/>
describe. I say, for example, &quot;My family extended basic unschooling <br/>
ideas to all kinds of learning,&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What your wrote seems good to me, Emily. But the part about Biblical <br/>
principles is a tad confusing.<br/>

I only read here and a local group and a few blogs, so while I know that those people are out there, it sounds like they are more numerous than I realized.  They seem to be the ones people are finding when they try to learn about unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
So, with so many people &quot;kind of unschooling&quot; or &quot;unschooling some things&quot; or just plain unschooling for academics, how do you distinguish what you are doing?  <br/>

getting in the way of the actual message. I seem to be spending a whole <br/>
lot of time, these days, clearing up what radical unschooling really is <br/>
because of the misconceptions that are now associated with the term. It <br/>
has always been there, a bit, but not so constantly like I&#39;m running <br/>
into now.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had multiple people in the last month or two say, &quot;Oh. I didn&#39;t <br/>
think you&#39;d say that or do that, as a radical unschooler.&quot; This is <br/>
commonly in regard to very basic things - like not letting kids throw <br/>
sand in the face of another kid - they didn&#39;t think I would be in favor <br/>
of stopping the sand-throwing kid. I&#39;ve heard, within the past week: <br/>
&quot;I&#39;m surprised to hear you cared about your children&#39;s behavior.&quot;  What <br/>
the heck? For us, all of life was about character - it has all been <br/>
about behavior, really.<br/>
<br/>
Radical unschooler seems to have gotten the reputation of being an even <br/>
more extreme version of the Taking Children Seriously/Noncoercive <br/>
Parenting ideology. If I start out talking about radical unschooling, I <br/>
can tell that people are shutting their minds immediately. I had someone <br/>
say, &quot;I have NO interest in radical unschooling,&quot; but then, as I talked <br/>
to her, what she was interested in was actually exactly what we here <br/>
mean by the term.<br/>
<br/>
So - if I use the term, then I have to counter the preconceived notions <br/>
people have - that&#39;s extra effort, an extra hurdle, that I don&#39;t have to <br/>
deal with if I just avoid the terminology and talk, instead, about ideas <br/>
and principles directly.  That&#39;s what I meant when I said I&#39;ve stopped <br/>
using it. I just use unschooling, most of the time, since that seems not <br/>
to set people on edge and get them all hostile and close-minded the way <br/>
&quot;radical unschooling&quot; does.<br/>

<br/>
Some people do both, and that&#39;s fine.  I know a couple of people who picked it up and used it (or ideas from it) 10 years ago when someone was active on unschooling.com, and some of the TCS (&quot;Taking Children Seriously&quot;) people said they unschooled, but I don&#39;t think there was really a lot of overlap, and it&#39;s been a long time. <br/>
<br/>
I object to anyone suggesting that any other philosophy or religion or cargo-cult thinking is necessary, or that it makes unschooling better.  Unschooling can co-exist with most other ideas, but the ideas of John Holt, and the reported experiences of the dozens of regulars and hundreds of short-term reporters shared on my pages and Joyce&#39;s, and the discussions on this list and a few others have sufficient information that no one needs an overlay of any other ABC, XYZ this-or-that. And some things are harmful to unschooling when they go beyond what is good for families or what makes sense.  If children need to be told &quot;don&#39;t ask&quot; or if they&#39;re told they can have anything on earth they want, those aspects can hamper learning, and damage the relationship between the parents and children.  If the parents are open to sharing what they know and why (&quot;because&quot; and &quot;I&#39;m your mom and I said so&quot; aren&#39;t good learning tools), and they help their children learn to live in the world (not in an imaginary magical world), then that&#39;s fine with  me.   <br/>
<br/>
Some religious are conducive to unschooling and others, not so much.  There&#39;s no reason to sort through them, because each parent who looks at unschooling is looking through her own eyes, with her own knowledge and base beliefs.  It doesn&#39;t work for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Some people figure out how to unschool in less than ideal circumstances, or they adapt it to fit an unusual situation.<br/>
Some people can&#39;t figure it out even in an idyllic setting.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it&#39;s not so much that people actually confuse radical unschooling with something else as that they want to disparage it and so throw all the insults they can muster. It&#39;s an ancient tool of prejudice and shunning, and because we&#39;re doing something so different, people are going to lash out in defense and sometimes in attack.  &quot;I can explain it if you want to understand it&quot; might be the best thing you can do sometimes.  <br/>
<br/>
That original story of the rock throwing was a good one.  I liked it.  Sometimes it&#39;s okay to throw rocks and sometimes it isn&#39;t.  Living by principles rather than rules, neither &quot;never&quot; nor &quot;always&quot; is true.  Living by rules of &quot;never,&quot; less thinking is required.  When there&#39;s less thinking, there&#39;s less learning.  Living by principles requires more thinking, and greater parental involvement.  That leads to more learning AND to better relationships.<br/>

The other day we took our dog to the Vet and as always adults in India when<br/>
talking to kids ask the same questions. What is your name and which school<br/>
do you go to?<br/>
<br/>
Gourika is now used to those questions. So she said &quot;I do not go to school&quot;.<br/>
Then the vet asked me why. I meet this man only once in three months at the<br/>

then we might have to get into a very long conversation!!!! And thanked him<br/>
and left.<br/>

It is important I guess to see who is asking this question and how important<br/>

&gt; overlay of any other ABC, XYZ this-or-that. And some things are harmful to<br/>
&gt; unschooling when they go beyond what is good for families or what makes<br/>
&gt; sense. If children need to be told &quot;don&#39;t ask&quot; or if they&#39;re told they can<br/>
&gt; have anything on earth they want, those aspects can hamper learning, and<br/>
&gt; damage the relationship between the parents and children. If the parents are<br/>
&gt; open to sharing what they know and why (&quot;because&quot; and &quot;I&#39;m your mom and I<br/>
&gt; said so&quot; aren&#39;t good learning tools), and they help their children learn to<br/>
&gt; live in the world (not in an imaginary magical world), then that&#39;s fine with<br/>
&gt; me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Some religious are conducive to unschooling and others, not so much.<br/>
&gt; There&#39;s no reason to sort through them, because each parent who looks at<br/>
&gt; unschooling is looking through her own eyes, with her own knowledge and base<br/>
&gt; beliefs. It doesn&#39;t work for everyone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Some people figure out how to unschool in less than ideal circumstances, or<br/>
&gt; they adapt it to fit an unusual situation.<br/>
&gt; Some people can&#39;t figure it out even in an idyllic setting.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sometimes it&#39;s not so much that people actually confuse radical unschooling<br/>
&gt; with something else as that they want to disparage it and so throw all the<br/>
&gt; insults they can muster. It&#39;s an ancient tool of prejudice and shunning, and<br/>
&gt; because we&#39;re doing something so different, people are going to lash out in<br/>
&gt; defense and sometimes in attack. &quot;I can explain it if you want to understand<br/>
&gt; it&quot; might be the best thing you can do sometimes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That original story of the rock throwing was a good one. I liked it.<br/>
&gt; Sometimes it&#39;s okay to throw rocks and sometimes it isn&#39;t. Living by<br/>
&gt; principles rather than rules, neither &quot;never&quot; nor &quot;always&quot; is true. Living<br/>
&gt; by rules of &quot;never,&quot; less thinking is required. When there&#39;s less thinking,<br/>
&gt; there&#39;s less learning. Living by principles requires more thinking, and<br/>
&gt; greater parental involvement. That leads to more learning AND to better<br/>
&gt; relationships.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-120785313">So - if I use the term,...-=-  <br/>
[Radical Unschooling...]<br/>
<br/>
-=-So - if I use the term, then I have to counter the preconceived notions <br/>
people have - that&#39;s extra effort, an extra hurdle, that I don&#39;t have to <br/>
deal with if I just avoid the terminology and talk, instead, about ideas <br/>
and principles directly. That&#39;s what I meant when I said I&#39;ve stopped <br/>
using it. I just use unschooling, most of the time, since that seems not <br/>
to set people on edge and get them all hostile and close-minded the way <br/>
&quot;radical unschooling&quot; does.-=-<br/>
<br/>
True, true, and I think (though I&#39;m not positive) that I almost always say &quot;unschooling&quot; unless I&#39;m involved in a discussion about the difference between unschooling and &quot;radical unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But because the learning people expect children to do (and that children pretty much cannot help but do) involves all SORTS of things besides math/language/science/history, that learning involves courtesy, manners, ethics, music, art, sports/dance/games, computers...   The way they will learn those things is the way they will learn the academics **IF** the parents are living a life filled with math/language/science/history, courtesy, manners, ethics, music, art, sports/dance/games, computers...<br/>
<br/>
If unschooling isn&#39;t better than school, if the kids would be better off in school, then unschooling is a bad match for that family.<br/>
<br/>
But in a family where it DOES work, it works because it&#39;s radical unschooling and not &quot;just&quot; unschooling.   Because &quot;just&quot; unschooling can be defined and discussed as rules and punishments galore, but no curriculum for academics.<br/>
<br/>
When I talk to strangers, relatives, friends about our homeschooling I always said &quot;we&#39;re unschoolers&quot; or &quot;we don&#39;t use a curriculum.&quot;   I have no bumper stickers about radical unschooling.  I have no flags waving about radical unschooling.  I did name my page radical unschooling a long time ago because expage.com/unschooling was already taken.   When I moved the entire code to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschooling">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a> I kept it just as it had been, though I&#39;ve since been able to expand it because I was no longer limited to a certain number of characters as I was when it looked like this:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010224044931/http://expage.com/radicalunschooling">http://web.archive.org/web/20010224044931/http://expage.com/radicalunschooling</a>  <br/>
It was in the name of the page, which showed up on that top line by default, but I didn&#39;t use the term in the rest of the page.<br/>
<br/>
My current version of that page:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschooling">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a><br/>
&quot;Radical&quot; only appears in the title.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1901226970">Unschooling what is culturally scholastic is a radical idea already.<br/>
<br/>
Then by extension, radical unschooling, is an even more radical<br/>
thought since John Holt appropriated an existing word --unschooled--<br/>
originally meaning uneducated; yet inspired by another word; see link<br/>
below. That word was to describe his concepts of greater freedom of<br/>
choice in learning as well as in decision making in all of life.<br/>
<br/>
Love the fun page here on the origin of the term unschooling:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschool/theterm">http://sandradodd.com/unschool/theterm</a><br/>
<br/>
The radical idea was to begin in childhood to learn and to make<br/>
decisions rather than hold off until adulthood.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to read his book about learning to play cello as an adult to<br/>
see if he writes there about children and unschooling in connection to<br/>
that experience. And also just because that&#39;s one of my favorite<br/>
instruments.<br/>
<br/>
The term unschooling is difficult enough for most people that I don&#39;t<br/>
use it except with other parents who are unschooling. I have said it<br/>
to some family members, and learned to forget the idea of using it<br/>
again with them. Too conflicted a notion for people who are *not*<br/>
unschooling. Double ditto for the term radical unschooling.<br/>

lot of time, these days, clearing up what radical unschooling really is <br/>
because of the misconceptions that are now associated with the term. It <br/>
has always been there, a bit, but not so constantly like I&#39;m running <br/>
into now.***<br/>
<br/>
Me too!  The food issue seems to be a huge stumbling block in that mix too. <br/>
 I&#39;ve heard people say, &quot;I&#39;m not a radical unschooler because I won&#39;t let my <br/>
child eat ______ , and that child has a severe allergy to it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It is soooo not how I look at food or radical unschooling.  People sometimes <br/>
have allergies, big deal.  What most kids, and adults have a hard time with is <br/>
the feeling of not being able to have whatever it is they can&#39;t have.  Eliminate <br/>
that and it&#39;s golden!  Chocolate chip cookies, even if you can&#39;t eat gluten?  No <br/>
problem, find an alternative and keep that around.  Someone has regular cookies <br/>
at a potluck?  No problem, bring an alternative with you, knowing that it will <br/>
be there, and if the alternative isn&#39;t eaten, then we deal with the outcome of <br/>
not feeling all that great.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that, people assume that radical unschooling means letting kids <br/>
do whatever they want to without any regard for anything other than immediate <br/>
self pleasing.  That isn&#39;t at all what it&#39;s about.  It means, to me, that people <br/>
need to eat and sleep and feel happy and comfortable and at peace with the <br/>
world.  It goes back to nest building.... a foundation in which to live, and <br/>
through that, kids can learn because the environment is ripe for it.  Kids who <br/>
are allergic to dairy and have nothing but milk to drink in the fridge do NOT <br/>
live in a house that is comfortable.  If a mom lets her kid throw sand in <br/>
another child&#39;s face and then ends up with no friends, that is NOT a happy kid <br/>
at peace with the world.<br/>
<br/>
More and more, and maybe I&#39;m just getting older, I&#39;m finding that peace is a BIG <br/>
deal for unschooling to thrive.  Creating peace is a huge undertaking, but at <br/>
the heart of it, a parent must be peaceful.<br/>

In my opinion, in my experience on earth and with how history and religion work, stating a philosophical point without trying it out or without having examples of &quot;worked&quot; and &quot;didn&#39;t work as well&quot; is just talk.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>For me, I started out thinking of unschooling only as natural learning - <br/>
no curriculum for academics. But the logic of it soon seeped over, for <br/>
me, into all kinds of learning. It wasn&#39;t a big stretch to go from &quot;no <br/>
curriculum needed&quot; to &quot;no teaching of academic subjects needed&quot; to &quot;no <br/>
teaching of all kinds of other things needed.&quot; &quot;Teaching&quot; means, to me, <br/>
the kind of thing school teachers do or parents do to &quot;teach a lesson.&quot; <br/>
In particular, teaching involves rewards and punishments as well as the <br/>
teacher deciding what the child is supposed to learn and when and how.  <br/>
I don&#39;t mean teaching by being a good example or by creating a great <br/>
environment for learning, etc.<br/>
<br/>
So - anyway - I think &quot;just unschooling&quot; can work out well because it <br/>
tends to move people toward extending the same principles to all kinds <br/>
of learning. Even if people don&#39;t get all the way to &quot;radical,&quot; the kids <br/>
could be living much better lives than the schooled alternatives. When <br/>
parents and kids stop fighting and struggling over schoolwork, their <br/>
relationship might improve a lot. And, they might stop struggling over <br/>
all kinds of other things, too.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;I want someone to teach me ...........&quot; versus &quot;I want to learn <br/>

<br/>
&quot;I want someone to teach me to speak Spanish&quot; versus &quot;I want to learn to <br/>
speak Spanish.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
or<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I am teaching Jane to read,&quot; versus &quot;Jane is learning to read.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Can you see how the second statement opens up a lot more possibilities <br/>
than the first? Where is the activity happening? Who has the power? Even <br/>
when a person wants to learn what is being taught, it is still better to <br/>
put the emphasis, the focus, on the learning rather than the teaching. <br/>
By &quot;better&quot; I mean more conducive to thinking of learning in a deeper <br/>
way, outside of subjects and lessons and lectures and tests and grades <br/>
and all that schoolish (teachery) stuff.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Teach&quot; carries a lot of baggage with it, and we can shed that baggage <br/>
more easily if we change our language and our thinking.  Teaching is not <br/>
only unnecessary for learning, it is often counterproductive to <br/>
learning. Teachers like to think they are two sides of the same coin, <br/>
but that&#39;s just not true, in practice.<br/>
<br/>
My mom used to argue with me, saying that I&#39;d &quot;taught&quot; my kids to read. <br/>
I insisted that I did not &quot;teach&quot; them. I didn&#39;t plan when they were to <br/>
be taught. I didn&#39;t create reading lessons. I didn&#39;t give them practice <br/>
exercises. I didn&#39;t test them. I had no schedule for them.<br/>
<br/>
She used to say, &quot;Yes, but you did what the best teachers do - you <br/>
answered all their questions, you surrounded them with a print-rich <br/>
environment, you modeled reading, you read aloud to them, you played <br/>
word games, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I&#39;d agree, I had done all that, but that didn&#39;t turn me into a <br/>
teacher and I did not teach my kids to read. If somebody hired a <br/>
&quot;reading teacher&quot; they would expect them to actually teach, to instruct, <br/>
to plan some kind of lessons, to try to insure the child was making <br/>
progress and to assess that progress.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers sometimes utilize teachers. But, by being careful with the <br/>
words we use,  we are more able to avoid confusing their teaching with <br/>
our learning.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d like to take this opportunity to say thanks. I have taken to telling anyone curious about unschooling that they really should read stuff by people like you, Pam, and Sandra and Meredith, and others here: folks with multiple kids, who have been unschooling a long time and have at least one kid who is at least a teenager, and a happy, intact marriage. Read what really has worked for people for years on end. I know Sandra has requested that we not say just &quot;thanks,&quot; but I thought that might be advice other might want to give as well. <br/>
<br/>
In the last 4 years, between online, especially on boards that are specifically for kids younger than school age, and in real life, I have seen so much unschooling advice given that people later either didn&#39;t believe or just couldn&#39;t sustain. I know 2 moms that strove so desperately to be perfect, selfless moms to their first that they literally had pretty intense nervous breakdowns when their second came along. I&#39;ve seen multiple families switch to a Waldorf curriculum because they felt unschooling allowed their kids to talk to them in ways they were not OK with, or because the husband was unhappy with kids up late at night. In the same vein, multiple moms I know have had to get IV fluids or had seizures lately because they were nursing older toddlers on demand even while vomiting or otherwise pretty sick. I&#39;m nursing a 3 1/2 year old. I think it&#39;s awesome. But I limit it when I&#39;m sick, and I&#39;m so frustrated to know that so many people feel they *have* to to the point of hurting their own health. I don&#39;t mean to insult these moms. I think they&#39;re wonderful. I just want people to get information on living an unschooling life that&#39;s a nice way to live for a long time for everyone in the family. I&#39;m tired of seeing the baby tossed out with the bathwater.<br/>

Honestly, I think part of the problem is that some unschoolers are so quick to tell others that they aren&#39;t really unschoolers because of X Y or Z. Maybe if there was a little more tact and encouragement so many people wouldn&#39;t bail on the concept altogether. (I know, that&#39;s not what this board is for, and that&#39;s fine by me.) I was sad to be told lately  by a non-unschooling homeschooler that someone &quot;says she an unschooler but other people say she can&#39;t be because her daughter takes classes.&quot; It just seems messed up that all these nice people who do just one not unschool-y thing--like what was the scandal about that conference? the speaker required that her son brush his teeth?--and a bunch of actual unschoolers who just don&#39;t want to be judged, just decide to call themselves something different. And then the folks who call themselves unschoolers may be the ones who either don&#39;t quite get it (not that I think I totally do yet!) or won&#39;t stick with it because what they are doing isn&#39;t sustainable for them. I asked a different local relatively new to homeschooling mom what surprised her at the last homeschooling conference, and she said, &quot;I learned that those unschoolers are full of shit! They say they don&#39;t do anything educational, but they do tons of educational stuff!&quot; I was so shocked, not least because I know she knows multiple unschooling families.<br/>
<br/>
Didn&#39;t mean to rant at you guys. Thanks for letting us know what works for you, and please keep it coming! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-100299102">***I&#39;m so frustrated to know that so many people feel they *have* to to the <br/>
point of hurting their own health. I don&#39;t mean to insult these moms. I think <br/>
they&#39;re wonderful. I just want people to get information on living an <br/>
unschooling life that&#39;s a nice way to live for a long time for everyone in the <br/>
family.***<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t think they were wonderful.  I know lots of wonderful moms.  If it <br/>
were a sliding scale, 10 being the most wonderful, maybe moms like that are on <br/>
the 6 or 7 of getting there and moms of the scream and yell and hit their kids <br/>
or neglect to feed them, being a zero.   So, those moms are above average <br/>
working towards being the wonderful mom that they aspire to be.  That&#39;s an <br/>
assumption.  I don&#39;t know those moms.<br/>

the concept altogether.***<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know...  If a mom can&#39;t stop doing what she&#39;s doing that is hindering <br/>
unschooling, then why call it that?  Why call it unschooling?  I used to attend <br/>
this semi regular play day meetup where everyone was unschooling.  In reality, <br/>
the parents that showed up there were really strict about food and manners and <br/>
whatnot.  It wasn&#39;t happy or fun or nice.  The kids would get upset as a direct <br/>
cause of the kind of parenting these mothers were doing.  I stopped going.  They <br/>
probably still call in unschooling, but it certainly wasn&#39;t anything that I&#39;ve <br/>
seen that led into the light of happy unschooling.  I can&#39;t stand there and give <br/>
my child ultimatums and knowingly watch that&#39;s child&#39;s face fall into sadness, <br/>
and STILL do it.  I just can&#39;t.  It&#39;s not that all of life is one great big <br/>
happy bubble, but I try my best to not be the unhappy piece that pops it.<br/>
<br/>
If people don&#39;t want to do what it takes to unschool, then they shouldn&#39;t <br/>
unschool, and they shouldn&#39;t call it that.  Chamille said the other day that it <br/>
seemed like some people want to say they unschool to feel like a part of some <br/>
&quot;cool&quot; club, that they just go through the motions of it but never actually <br/>
change anything to make their kids&#39; lives all happy and awesome.<br/>
<br/>
Encouragement is a good thing.  Being blunt and honest is a good thing too.  No <br/>
matter how nice someone is, if they are perceived as being rude, it doesn&#39;t <br/>
change the niceness.  That rudeness is within that own person&#39;s thoughts. <br/>
 That&#39;s a huge mirror that some people can&#39;t or won&#39;t ever look into.  A child <br/>
is only a child for a very short time and parents only get one shot at it. <br/>
 Getting unschooling up and running sooner, is better, IF that&#39;s what you want <br/>
to do.  If that&#39;s not the goal, then who cares?  <br/>
<br/>
There are some things that simply don&#39;t mesh with unschooling.  I&#39;ve seen enough <br/>
of it to know and see the outcomes of that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2015029287">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I have taken to telling anyone curious about unschooling that they really <br/>
should read stuff by people like you, Pam, and Sandra and Meredith, and others <br/>
here: folks with multiple kids, who have been unschooling a long time and have <br/>
at least one kid who is at least a teenager, and a happy, intact marriage. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 There are wonderful unschoolers like Joyce Fetterol, Deb Lewis  ( those just at <br/>
the top of my head) who only have on child! They are not parents of multiple <br/>
kids<br/>
but I love their voices.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;In the last 4 years, between online, especially on boards that are <br/>
specifically for kids younger than school age, and in real life, I have seen so <br/>
much unschooling advice given that people later either didn&#39;t believe or just <br/>
couldn&#39;t sustain. I know 2 moms that strove so desperately to be perfect, <br/>
selfless moms to their first that they literally had pretty intense nervous <br/>
breakdowns when their second came along.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 But that was not about unschooling. I have seen that at least once just like <br/>
that and I think it was because the mother did not fully understand unschooling.<br/>
  Just because one comes to an unschooling group and posts on it many times it <br/>
does not mean they fully understand unschooling the way it is discussed here in <br/>
this group.  Just because a mother lets a child hits her in the face it does not <br/>
mean that mother is striving for being a perfect mother. And yes I have heard <br/>
that!<br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve seen multiple families switch to a Waldorf curriculum because <br/>
they felt unschooling allowed their kids to talk to them in ways they were not <br/>
OK with, or because the husband was unhappy with kids up late at night. In the <br/>
same vein, multiple moms I know have had to get IV fluids or had seizures lately <br/>
because they were nursing older toddlers on demand even while vomiting or <br/>
otherwise pretty sick.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It was not &quot;unschooling that allowed their kids to talk to them in the ways they <br/>
were not OK with&quot;. Unschooling does not allow or disallow anything on anyone&#39;s <br/>
home. <br/>
<br/>
It was the lack of understanding unschooling and a lack of being a partner to <br/>
your children and your partner.<br/>
To your children because kids do want to be nice to their dads and need guidance <br/>
and presence and to your partner because his needs were not taken in <br/>
consideration.<br/>
About the nursing , if you are too sick to nurse then you are too sick. Nursing <br/>
a toddler on demand will not make someone have to get IV fluids unless that <br/>
person is dehidrated for other reasons like being sick, or not taking in enough <br/>
fluids.  Again that is not unschooling if someone is not taking care of their <br/>
own health or someone is sick. <br/>
<br/>
There are no unschooling rules.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I was sad to be told lately by a non-unschooling homeschooler that someone <br/>
&quot;says she an unschooler but other people say she can&#39;t be because her daughter <br/>
takes classes.&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why was that sad for you?  If she did not even consider herself and unschooler?<br/>
 I have seen some people come to groups and say :&quot;I did not know until today <br/>
that I was an unschooler all along&quot; But this people never really unschooled. <br/>
They may have not followed a curriculum but once they start talking about it  <br/>
what they did is not the same as  discussed here at all!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;It just seems messed up that all these nice people who do just one not <br/>
unschool-y thing--like what was the scandal about that conference? the speaker <br/>
required that her son brush his teeth?--and a bunch of actual unschoolers who <br/>
just don&#39;t want to be judged, just decide to call themselves something <br/>
different&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have not heard of that incident but there are people that call themselves <br/>
unschoolers but they teach math curriculum or they require kids to read at least <br/>
15 minutes a day, or cannot watch TV , or cannot play video games, or only a <br/>
prescribed amount of screen time a day, or kids cannot eat anything not deamed <br/>
&quot;healthy&quot;, or they cannot drinl pop/soda,......<br/>
<br/>
It seems like you feel more people should  be unschoolers but I find that many  <br/>
parents would not be good unschoolers. <br/>
<br/>
Not everyone can or should unschool.<br/>

<br/>
Is this:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;a different local relatively new to homeschooling mom&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the same person as this:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;she knows multiple unschooling families&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Also, how do you know that she knows multiple unschooling families? Do<br/>
you both know them? Or did she say she knows them? Or does she know<br/>
their names or know of them?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m asking because if this person knows these families well then I&#39;m<br/>
not sure how she came to the conclusions she has come to. It makes no<br/>
sense to me.<br/>
<br/>
For myself, I doubt seriously if people know me unless I consider them<br/>
to be friends. They can surmise or guess or conclude in their heads<br/>
some opinion about how I live without really knowing me that well or<br/>
having any real clue how I live on a daily basis.<br/>

<br/>
Me, too.<br/>
I&#39;ve been trying to provide that for a long, long time.  Unfortunately, it&#39;s not easy to understand, and some people think they &quot;have to&quot; let their kids stay up as late as they want, no matter how old they are or who&#39;s up with them, or what the circumstances of the evening are or what the arrangement of their house is.   <br/>
<br/>
-=- she said, &quot;I learned that those unschoolers are full of shit! They say they don&#39;t do anything educational, but they do tons of educational stuff!&quot; -=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t use the word &quot;educational&quot; of what I think unschoolers should be doing.  I created a learning environment without using the word &quot;educational.&quot;  That doesn&#39;t make me full of shit.  <br/>
<br/>
Some people see the world through shit-colored glasses.   All the time and energy you were spending worring about others could be better spent on your own children&#39;s happiness.<br/>
