<div id="ygrps-yiv-574071743">I have a long haired 5yo ds.  Thanks to unschooling I have given up a <br/>
lot of control, and am still working on letting go of more.  I <br/>
figured when people started assuming he was a girl at first glance, <br/>
he would ask for his hair to be cut.  Nope.  <br/>
My dh has long hair and a good friend of my older son(8) has long hair<br/>
(he&#39;s 11), so my 5yo has cool role models.  He is very confident <br/>
about just stating he is a boy, when people mistake him.  <br/>
I wish I were better at it.  I feel uneasy for people when I know <br/>
they are confused by his clothes and his &quot;boyness&quot;, but also feel <br/>
weird about offering the information to them(that&#39;s up to my son).  I <br/>
have heard disparaging comments about my older ds friend and his <br/>
hair, when people didn&#39;t know I was the mother of my 5yo.<br/>
It&#39;s a stange thing how much of a lesson this has been for me.<br/>
It has been a forced process of letting go of what others think, and <br/>
realizing how much it really doesn&#39;t matter.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My son Julian has thick curly hair that is cut when he gets around to it. <br/>
He&#39;s a very &quot;pretty&quot; boy, and when he was a little younger and his hair got <br/>
long everyone assumed he was a girl. I was blown away that he would very <br/>
casually say, &quot;actually, I&#39;m a boy,&quot; with no sense of insult or concern. (The <br/>
person making the mistake would often get VERY apologetic.)  He didn&#39;t see <br/>
being mistaken for a girl as a bad thing, and certainly it didn&#39;t motivate <br/>
him to get more frequent haircuts.<br/>
<br/>
Now he&#39;s hit puberty and no one would mistake him for a girl. (He&#39;s still <br/>
cute though.)<br/>
