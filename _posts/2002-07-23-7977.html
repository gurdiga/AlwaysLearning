<div id="ygrps-yiv-963160678">I have more information.  Some is interesting and some isn&#39;t.  <br/>
<br/>
The boycott (which I understand to have been one letter with a couple of <br/>
&quot;yeah, me too&quot;s just to the list) is being discussed on a list with 40 people <br/>
or so.  That list broke off of a list that used to have 650 people at the <br/>
time, I think, but now has over 847.<br/>
<br/>
So the big list got healthier and more peaceful when some left.  But some <br/>
people are on both.  And although the little list seems to think it has &quot;a <br/>
troll,&quot; it appears they have maybe ten or more.   Or perhaps more and more <br/>
people are offended by their tone and are passing information out in <br/>
increasing numbers.  I don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
But the boycott seems to be intended to hurt me financially.  And the <br/>
suggestion is made there that working &quot;the conference circuit&quot; (there isn&#39;t <br/>

847 members. And it has certainly been more peaceful lately...<br/>

Sheesh.<br/>

I meant to say had, not over.  Sorry.  I first guessed and then decided to <br/>
just check.<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine in Houston found out about the boycott and was really <br/>
surprised.  She&#39;s known me since our little kids were REALLY little. Her mom <br/>
lives in Los Lunas, south of Albuquerque, and we&#39;ve visited in person over <br/>
the years.  <br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t yet told Ramona King.  She lives here now, but used to live in <br/>
Houston.  When I told the organizer of the Houston conference that I know <br/>
someone who used to be in her group, she said Ramona was the one who <br/>
recommended they invite me, before she moved away.  Ramona had heard me in <br/>
Fort Worth years ago.  Ramona is going to be surprised to hear I&#39;m racist.  <br/>
She might not want to leave her kids with me anymore, or have Holly go with <br/>
them to the playgroup days.<br/>
<br/>
(That was sarcasm of a tongue-in-cheek sort.  Ramona&#39;s African American, and <br/>
it was her idea for me to speak there.  My detractor claimed I was racist for <br/>
saying Arabs are Caucasian.)<br/>

oooooops.  Most of a long message was lost somehow.  I rarely lose a post.  <br/>
Darn it.<br/>
<br/>
I had detailed how much money I don&#39;t make on Thinking Sticks, how I&#39;m paying <br/>
$9 a month for advertisement-free webspace because lots of people read the <br/>
articles I&#39;ve posted and linked to, but I didn&#39;t want them having to see <br/>
tacky advertisements.  <br/>
<br/>
I had quoted from HEM&#39;s website about the circulation numbers and figured my <br/>
cut of people&#39;s hard earned money was about a fifth of a penny per reader.<br/>
<br/>
I had told how of the four conferences I&#39;ve yet to attend this year, one is <br/>
local and free (they&#39;re not even buying my lunch) and the organizer, whose <br/>
last name is Miura and whose kids are part Japanese assured me if boycott <br/>
word reached her she would just laugh because she&#39;s known me so long and <br/>
knows I&#39;m not racist.<br/>
<br/>
Of those other three, some are various combinations airfare and room only, or <br/>
fee going to pay for the airfare of a kid who&#39;s going with me (Marty&#39;s going <br/>
to one and Holly&#39;s going to another.)  And irony of ironies, one has a fee <br/>
based on attendance, and talk of a boycott could EASILY pique the interest of <br/>
enough people to cause my fee to be higher.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry the post was cut short.  This one&#39;s shorter, though, and so less <br/>
reading.<br/>
