<div id="ygrps-yiv-2057064622">Hi everyone.  I just need to vent for a minute to sympathetic ears {or <br/>
eyes ;)}.  I&#39;m so frustrated with my sister and I feel so bad for her <br/>
kids.  She has one girl - almost 3, and one boy - just turned 1.  They <br/>
go to a daycare from 7-5 every day and are placed in seperate rooms, <br/>
never allowed to see or  play together.  Tonight, I asked her if that <br/>
bothered her and she said no, she was glad because then her son could <br/>
develop his own personality away from his sister.  So I asked her if she <br/>
felt I didn&#39;t have my own personality (she&#39;s 2 yrs older than me) and <br/>
she said no, of course she didn&#39;t think that.  <br/>
<br/>
Aside- as children we went to a daycare where the owner told me I <br/>
shouldn&#39;t play with my sister so much.  After crying about it to my mom, <br/>
my mom told the owner that her daughters should be allowed to play with <br/>
whoever they wanted, especially each other.   Also, I have four dds who <br/>
pretty much only play with each other all day long and are the best of <br/>
friends.<br/>
<br/>
So next, my sister said that next year it would all be different because <br/>
she wanted to have another baby and then stay home, except for Sarah who <br/>
would still have to go to daycare a few days a week.  I said, &quot;Why?&quot; <br/>
 She just said, &quot;I think it&#39;s good for her.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
As of now, my sister feels she&#39;s having problems now with her daughter <br/>
because Sarah&#39;s not potty trained at home, only at daycare.  When I <br/>
asked her for details, she explained that no matter how she&#39;s tried at <br/>
home, Sarah just won&#39;t use the toilet.  I reminded her that since Sarah <br/>
was about 4 wks old she&#39;s been with kids her own age all day long and <br/>
treated that if she doesn&#39;t act like them, she&#39;s going to be in trouble. <br/>
 So now, at home, the only other kid is her little brother and no one&#39;s <br/>
giving him a hard time about using a diaper.  My sister did agree with <br/>
me that harrassing one child and not the other did seem unfair.  Then <br/>
she went on to tell me that at daycare, at specific intervals during the <br/>
day, the children in Sarah&#39;s room all go sit on their potty&#39;s.  Can you <br/>
imagine???  When she told me of that all I could think of was circus <br/>
elephants being trained to sh-t in the parking lot before the show.  To <br/>
be honest, it just makes me feel sick that my neice and nephew and how <br/>
many other kids are being trained like animals.<br/>
<br/>
 None of this is a surprise to me.  I just feel so angry about it.  And <br/>
now my sister is mad because I questioned her about it.  I&#39;m not too <br/>
worried about that because she and I are very close and went through the <br/>
same thing in reverse about unschooling.      Notice how I said we&#39;re <br/>
very close.  In the last 32 years, the only friendship she and I have <br/>
maintained is with each other, but she&#39;s *glad* that her kids aren&#39;t <br/>
allowed to be together.  I just don&#39;t get it.  <br/>
<br/>
AND...she was at my house all day today and while she was here she was <br/>
paying her bills and worried they wouldn&#39;t have enough money to pay them <br/>
all or even get all the groceries they needed.  Between my sister and <br/>
her husband, they make about $150-175, 000/yr and have a family of 4. <br/>
 We make about 30-40 with a family of 6.  Yet when it all comes down to <br/>
paying bills we&#39;re in the same crunch.  So why does she need to work and <br/>
send her children away?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for listening.  There&#39;s really nothing that can be done. <br/>
 Ugh!  I&#39;m just so sad about it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-189150502">ohhh.. myheart goes out to you... my sister and her husband found out they needed to job transfer to NYC from MD...  They LEFT their 1 year old with a neighbor &quot;so she wouldnt miss school&quot; while they looked for housing... When they DID bring her back they brought her back on a Sunday and she started daycare the very next day &quot;to keep in a routine&quot;   I was always speechless and never wanted to talk about it to any of my sibs because I felt deep sadness...  but guess what.. she had her third last year and is a STAY at home mom...  still though... a COMPLETE authority-pleasing-teachers-know-everything type of person.. but she has come a long way....     <br/>
 <br/>
btw... she &quot;happened&quot; to get a mysterious subscription to Mothering Magazine... hmmm... now who could have done that???  <br/>

<br/>
Hi!  I&#39;m Susan, I&#39;ve been lurking here for a couple months, just reading <br/>
emails and not having time to post anything lately.  Anyway, you email really got <br/>
me going this morning.  I just got out of the daycare business after 8 years, <br/>
and I can totally relate to what you are saying.  Daycare is such a sad thing <br/>
and I regret that my oldest child went to daycare as a baby.<br/>
<br/>
I really tried to do an excellent job at daycare and I&#39;m sure most people in <br/>
the daycare business try to do that too, but in my opinion (and it&#39;s just my <br/>
opinion, I don&#39;t want to get flamed) daycares are just not a good thing at all <br/>
for kids.  First off, you get kids that are separated from their siblings from <br/>
birth on up and they never get to know their siblings or form lasting bonds <br/>
with them.  Secondly, kids that are in daycare all day long, never form a <br/>
strong bond with their parents.  Thirdly, these kids in daycare are so starved for <br/>
attention, that they will do anything to get a few seconds of attention from <br/>
their tired parents at the end of the day, and it&#39;s usually something bad that <br/>
gets Mom and dad&#39;s attention.  The behavior and what they try to do for <br/>
attention gets worse and worse as they get older.  <br/>
<br/>
The cost of daycare keeps going up, and society leads parents to believe that <br/>
they can&#39;t get by on one income, or it&#39;s not OK to stay home with your kids <br/>
because then they don&#39;t get the &quot;social skills&quot; that they need to survive in <br/>
the &quot;real world&quot;, so parents pay the high price to send their kids to daycare to <br/>
get some &quot;socialization.&quot;  The parents end up strapped for cash because <br/>
usually one income goes to just paying the daycare bill and if there&#39;s any left <br/>
over, it goes to feeding the kids fast or convenience foods (also expensive) <br/>
because they are just too tired and worn out from work to want to deal with making <br/>
a meal, and that&#39;s all their kids will eat because that&#39;s mostly what they <br/>
eat at the daycare center. <br/>
<br/>
I look back at some of the sad situations I had with daycare over the years, <br/>
and I wonder how some of those kids are going to turn out.  Last night on our <br/>
local news here in MN, there was a report on how kids in daycare are more <br/>
likely to grow up to be criminals.  What gripes me about stuff like that is that <br/>
it&#39;s always turned around into becoming the daycare&#39;s or school&#39;s fault that <br/>
their kids turn out this way, it&#39;s never the fault of the parents that dumped <br/>
their kids off and never paid attention to them.  So anyway, I didn&#39;t mean to <br/>
get off on a tangent, but I have seen over the years what happens to kids in <br/>
daycare and I just don&#39;t feel it&#39;s a good thing for our society and I can see why <br/>
you are saddened by your niece and nephew being in daycare.   Susan<br/>
