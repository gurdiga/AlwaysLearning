I&#39;m about to become a college dropout for the  second time in my life.<br/>
The first time, I was a freshman in New York City  during the last years<br/>
of the Vietnam War. I decided I didn&#39;t want to be a  part of what we<br/>
called &quot;the system.&quot;<br/>
This time, I&#39;m not a student but an  instructor. And I&#39;m dropping out<br/>
again. It will be hard, very hard, because  I love teaching.<br/>
But I know when I&#39;m beat. I can&#39;t do this job  anymore.<br/>
Here&#39;s the problem: In our zeal for numbers, for measuring our kids  so<br/>
we can report that they really can write because they&#39;ve passed a test,<br/>
we&#39;re focusing on the forest but forgetting the trees.<br/>
Writing is putting  ideas on paper. That&#39;s all -- and it&#39;s a lot. It&#39;s<br/>
one of the most important  things we can learn to do, putting our ideas<br/>
on paper, expressing what we  think. Putting our ideas on paper can make<br/>
magic.<br/>
But to make kids pass  our standardized tests, we force them to see<br/>
writing as simply a formula, as  anything but what it really is. Writing<br/>
should be dangerous stuff -- and it  was before we killed it.<br/>
We tell kids, &quot;Okay, this is how to write. You must  have five paragraphs<br/>
in your essay, and the first paragraph must have a  thesis sentence in<br/>
which you specify the three main points of your paper,  and each<br/>
paragraph must have four to seven sentences, and each sentence must  have<br/>
eight to 10 words.&quot; (Yes, trust me; that&#39;s what they&#39;re being  taught.)<br/>
But we forget that we&#39;re not talking about words and sentences and<br/>
paragraphs; we&#39;re talking about ideas. What we&#39;re really telling<br/>
students is that they must have exactly three ideas in everything they<br/>
write, and each idea must be exactly such a length. And it&#39;s ludicrous.<br/>
Ideas can&#39;t be measured; they can&#39;t be quantified.<br/>
But I&#39;m clearly in the  minority now, marching in the opposite direction,<br/>
going against all the  educators and bureaucrats. Still, I refuse to<br/>
teach -- even to allow -- this  mediocre writing, this uninspired thinking.<br/>
So, I quit. Our children, our  teenagers, are victims of the Stockholm<br/>
Syndrome; they&#39;ve begun identifying  with their captors. Our schools have<br/>
brainwashed them into believing that  writing -- that thinking -- is<br/>
simply a matter of numbers. I can no longer  teach them because, more<br/>
than ever, they no longer believe me when I tell  them that writing in<br/>
the real world isn&#39;t like that.<br/>
Look, I tell them.  Read something that&#39;s been published. Do you find<br/>
everything in five neat  paragraphs, with four to seven sentences in each<br/>
paragraph?<br/>
They look at  me. Why am I telling them this?<br/>
And look, I say. Don&#39;t real writers repeat  words? (Oh, yes -- they&#39;re<br/>
told they must never repeat words.) And their  eyes give away their<br/>
mistrust of what I&#39;m telling them. I&#39;m denying the  validity of their<br/>
belief system, contradicting everything they&#39;ve been  told.<br/>
But I keep trying. Look, I say. Don&#39;t all these writers, these people<br/>
who have been published, don&#39;t they often use the word &quot;I&quot;? (They&#39;re<br/>
told they must never use that word in most schools.) Don&#39;t some of these<br/>
real writers use paragraphs that are one sentence long, or sentences<br/>
that are one word long? These people you&#39;re reading are real writers,<br/>
and they know there are no formulas to follow in writing.<br/>
As I say it,  though, I know I&#39;m telling them a lie. There are formulas<br/>
in writing, the  ones the people in Tallahassee use to show us that our<br/>
children can write.  That the system works.<br/>
Yes, it works: It produces unthinking teenagers who  produce automatic<br/>
essays full of, well . . . nothing, really. Because  another thing<br/>
they&#39;re taught is that opinions are bad. Of course, opinions  express<br/>
ideas, and if you follow that thinking through to its logical<br/>
conclusion, then ideas are bad. I&#39;ll have my students read a<br/>
particularly good essay, and they&#39;ll say, Well, but that&#39;s an opinion.<br/>
Yes, it is, I answer. And? And, well, that&#39;s bad. You can&#39;t have<br/>
opinions, only facts.<br/>
So they go out into the world, and they&#39;re timid;  they&#39;re afraid to have<br/>
an opinion. Ah, but that&#39;s good: good for business,  which likes people<br/>
to do as they&#39;re told; good for the country, because  dissent, especially<br/>
now, is . . . well, not good.<br/>
So I tell them, You  know, it was a crime in most of this country many<br/>
years ago to teach a slave  to read or write. Why do you think we had<br/>
those laws? Sometimes, one of the  less timid students will cautiously<br/>
raise a hand and take a stab at it.  Because slaves could get ideas?<br/>
Right, yes. Slaves could get ideas, and ideas  are dangerous. The owners,<br/>
those in power, didn&#39;t want that. Do you see any  parallel between that<br/>
and what&#39;s happening in our schools?<br/>
No, they  don&#39;t. Oh, I might have one occasionally who gets it, but the<br/>
majority have  been trained so well they don&#39;t see any connection.<br/>
Most of them think I&#39;m  nuts. Just another crazy, ranting professor.<br/>
Their eyes blink off, and they  go someplace where they don&#39;t have to<br/>
think about what I&#39;m saying. They&#39;re  planning lunch or their trip to<br/>
Ybor City that night. Someplace safe.<br/>
But  I&#39;m trying to steer them away from that safety, that sameness. I&#39;m<br/>
trying to  make them dangerous. I&#39;m trying to get them to think.<br/>
They&#39;ll have none of  that, thank you. Our young people have had the<br/>
thinking beaten out of them.  We do it in our classrooms, in what we have<br/>
them write. We do it especially  in what we have them read. It&#39;s no<br/>
longer a secret that our standardized  tests, even our textbooks, have<br/>
been sanitized. They&#39;ve been cut up, had all  the important ideas taken<br/>
out of them -- all the tough questions, the  conflicts.<br/>
I explain to my students that writers don&#39;t write about nice  things;<br/>
they write about the hard things, the difficult ideas. No one writes<br/>
about what a nice day it is.<br/>
But all this has been going on for years. So  why am I quitting now?<br/>
Because it&#39;s about to get much worse. Now that  Tallahassee has taken<br/>
over completely, now that we&#39;re to have one seamless  educational system,<br/>
prekindergarten through graduate school, the practices  entrenched in our<br/>
schools will become entrenched in our colleges.<br/>
It&#39;s  happening already. The students who have been trained to write this<br/>
way are  now teachers who teach writing this way. More and more, I<br/>
encounter college  writing instructors who insist on the formula: five<br/>
paragraphs, no more --  even in advanced courses, even in other<br/>
departments. The older professors,  the ones to whom the formula essay is<br/>
simply bad writing, are retiring. The  younger ones are taking over,<br/>
passing on their wisdom about writing, what  they were taught: Count your<br/>
ideas. Be careful not to have too many.<br/>
And  if a student dares to have four ideas, instead of three? . . . Toss<br/>
one out.  Only three ideas allowed. I&#39;ve seen students fail assignments<br/>
because they  had the wrong numbers.<br/>
And they can&#39;t stop writing that way. Many have told  me, even in tears,<br/>
that they try to write differently, but they  can&#39;t.<br/>
Brainwashing does that. Now, imagine the future. Imagine these  students,<br/>
your children, afraid to write, to put their ideas on paper.  Imagine<br/>
them trying to fight for what they believe in -- if they&#39;re brave  enough<br/>
to believe in anything at all.<br/>
Imagine them in business. In  medicine. In law.<br/>
In politics.<br/>
As for me, I have no children, other than  the ones I&#39;ve worked with over<br/>
the years. But I no longer can fight this  system, the one that tries to<br/>
deaden our kids, to make them afraid to think.  Worse, I&#39;m afraid that<br/>
eventually they&#39;ll get to me, too.<br/>
The first time  I dropped out of college, I was afraid the system would<br/>
kill my ideas and  make me less human. I didn&#39;t want any part of it.<br/>
This time, the system is  different, but the result will be the same.<br/>
I don&#39;t want any part of this  system, either.<br/>
