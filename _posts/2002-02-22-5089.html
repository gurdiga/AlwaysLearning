<div id="ygrps-yiv-228320104">Well, we had the first Recess day at my house this week.  I had advertised<br/>
it in the local &quot;school-at-home&quot; support group newsletter (only kind of<br/>
group we have).  3 families showed up.  The kids played outside, watched<br/>
television, played chess, taught the little kids how to swing, had some kind<br/>
of basketball competition.<br/>
<br/>
The moms mostly sat under a tree, enjoying the beautiful day.  I<br/>
chit-chatted and worked tangrams with some of the kids.  It was very<br/>
pleasant.  The plan is to do it once a week.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-265159321">Julie, would you post a copy of your announcement?<br/>
Pretty please, so that I may copy it. (If I may?) We<br/>
don&#39;t have a local newsleter, but I can put up a flyer<br/>
at the  library.  Your idea is SO appropro....most of<br/>
the homeschoolers (there are about 30 families in my<br/>
county) in this area use ABEKA  :( or a variation of<br/>
it....but &quot;recesss&quot; may be something they are short<br/>
of.<br/>

Oh yes, used mobile home steps work OK for goats.<br/>

 Someone recently posted on RUL they were looking for unschoolers in the<br/>
Texas hill country. I don&#39;t know how close to you they would be but you can<br/>
sub & check it out or email me & I&#39;ll post for you. They posted near the end<br/>
of February. I know you have had a hard time finding other unschoolers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-71449075">It&#39;s not just academics that are keeping homeschoolers from recess. <br/>
Someone in my local group is trying to set up a program with a health<br/>
club.  For $30 to 40 a month, you can bring your child in to participate<br/>
in various activities twice a week.  While this sounds like it could be<br/>
fun, I think these programs result in folks having less free time to go<br/>
to the park or just hang out with friends.  Besides, it wouldn&#39;t cost<br/>
much more than that for a family membership to the health club and then<br/>
you could go and use the facilities whenever you wished.<br/>
<br/>
We have managed to keep a park day running for a few years now, at least<br/>
during the nice weather, but it used to be weekly and is now just once or<br/>
twice a month and attendance has dropped from lots of families to usually<br/>
just 2 to 4 families participating.  Park days are my favorite homeschool<br/>
event!  It is so cool to watch kids of multiple ages play well together<br/>
and it provides support for the parents too.  We also do &quot;play days&quot;<br/>
where someone volunteers their home and everyone who comes brings a snack<br/>
to share and the kids play while the adults visit.<br/>

but it does frost me sometimes that they place a very high value on<br/>
&quot;classes&quot; and a much lower value on park days and play dates.  My son<br/>
and I both find classes uninspiring, but we think park day makes the<br/>
world go &#39;round!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s the same here.. although I didn&#39;t officially &#39;advertise&#39;.. I did<br/>
mention to some of the moms at the more structured meeting that I would like<br/>
for some of us to get together for &#39;fun&#39; stuff..to just hang out.. no<br/>
organized gym classes or field trips.. and they looked at me like I was<br/>
nuts.. &#39;you mean go to all this trouble for kids just to socialize?&#39;..<br/>
Amazing!  So needless to say my girls and I are no longer a part of that<br/>
group.. just us and the goats now! LOL<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1270656608">Hi Sharon,<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like you guys had a ball.  I bet Roy loved having the kids around.<br/>
For the summer, we have moved recess to the local state park for picnic<br/>
lunches and swimming in the river.  We had a great time as well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-994958317">&lt;&lt;Where did everybody go?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry Roy was sad.  We had a few no-show days ourselves.  The kids were<br/>
bummed.  Our group has continued to get smaller and smaller, down to about 3<br/>
families whose kids are good friends with my kids anyway.  At least, it<br/>
gives them a chance to get together regularly.<br/>
<br/>
 I had one mom tell me SHE (as opposed to her kids) would come if they would<br/>
jump rope or something.  I suggested she bring a jump rope and see if anyone<br/>
wanted to play.  She looked at me like I had two heads.  For some people,<br/>
playing anything that a child chooses to play just for the fun of it is<br/>
wasting time but if the parent chooses it, it somehow becomes &quot;worth it.&quot;<br/>
Of course, the kids have done everything from watching television, to<br/>
playing chess, to wrestling, to doing wild faces on each other with make-up,<br/>
to Legos, to card tricks, etc.,  all on their own without parental input.<br/>
Oh well.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;school-at-homers&quot; are organizing classes once a week for next year and<br/>
of course, we have been invited to participate.  We are having Recess there<br/>
and I&#39;m going to do a Book Discussion Club (I refuse to call it a class)<br/>
where the only limit is that you have read the book and want to discuss it.<br/>
People are already pushing to limit content or age group but I refuse.  I<br/>
suggested that parents also participate in the club particularly if they<br/>
were concerned.  I set it up to where I pick the first book only and other<br/>
participants pick subsequent books.  We are going to start with &quot;The Giver&quot;.<br/>
The only thing I have going for me is that the other moms tend to like me,<br/>
even if I don&#39;t plan a betrothal for my daughter and I think my 6 years of<br/>
college were a colossal waste of time and energy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-173638103">I was in a Christian bookstore yesterday and looking around while my<br/>
daughter was going to the bathroom (the reason we were in the store this<br/>
particular time). I came across a scrapbook for school children. I open it<br/>
up, out of curiosity and on the very first page it says this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;God created recess<br/>
To bring a spot of joy<br/>
Into our schools of learning<br/>
For every girl and boy<br/>
Other memories linger<br/>
Though some completely fade<br/>
But memories<br/>
From the playground<br/>
Are the best ever made&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It made me glad the my children&#39;s entire lives consist of one big recess.<br/>
<br/>
It also got me thinking about my own school experience. The poem is right.<br/>
The memories that are most vivid are the ones of recess. I don&#39;t have many<br/>
memories of otherwise and the ones I do have, are bad ones about being made<br/>
fun of. How sad.<br/>
