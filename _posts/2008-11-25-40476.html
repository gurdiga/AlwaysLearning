<div id="ygrps-yiv-1410081929">Any time there is talk of limits it enevitably turns to discussions <br/>
about tv and sugar. It&#39;s strange how these are such big issues when <br/>
there are so many *other* things that all parents, even unschoolers, <br/>
don&#39;t expose their kids to because of they believe those things are <br/>
harmful.  I mean, Pagans don&#39;t generally read Bible stories to their <br/>
kids.  Most parents don&#39;t bring home marajuana or cigarettes to their <br/>
kids just in case they might be interested.  They don&#39;t make a point <br/>
of buying things made by child labor.  Or take their kids to see <br/>
abortions, just in case the kids might want one someday.  Or take <br/>
their kids to church even though they&#39;re aetheists.  <br/>
<br/>
No limits doesn&#39;t mean *intentionally exposing* your kids to things <br/>
you believe are harmful.  People can and will debate all day about <br/>
whether or not sugar is harmful or tv is harmful or religion is <br/>
harmful or the lack of religion is harmful or if eating meat is wrong <br/>
or not or whether we should go out of our way to not buy from <br/>
unethical businesses.  But those conclusions have nothing to do with <br/>
limits.  Those conclusions based on individual experiences and values <br/>
and knowledge.  <br/>
<br/>
Having limits or no limits comes in when, in the course of living <br/>
life, kids are exposed to things that the parent disagrees with or <br/>
believes are harmful.  And if we&#39;re living full, rich, exciting, <br/>
interesting lives, then this will probably happen often!  At that <br/>
point, the parent can choose whether or not they will limit that <br/>
thing.  <br/>
<br/>
And if we choose, no limits, then we have a lot of choices about how <br/>
to handle it.  It doesn&#39;t have to be &quot;No limits- so go do whatever <br/>
you want!&quot;  It&#39;s no limits with the parent as the guide and the <br/>
mentor, explaining why they believe that thing is harmful, but <br/>
letting the kid explore and learn and make their own decision.  Or <br/>
not decide yet, and leave it open to more discussion and thought. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe the &quot;harmful thing&quot; is sugar or tv or meat or consumerism or <br/>
religion or aethism or drugs or whatever.  It&#39;s going to be different <br/>
in every family.  Having no limits is about the way we handle <br/>
whatever that &quot;harmful thing&quot; is for us, when our kid gets interested <br/>
in it.</div>

<br/>
I think instead of having the dichotomy of limits or no limits, it&#39;s  <br/>
clearer and more nurturing and more partner-like to have no arbitrary  <br/>
limits.<br/>
<br/>
Limits for the sake of limits, bedtime by the clock, TV on a timer,  <br/>
eating pre-measured amounts of mom-chosen foods at pre-set hours is  <br/>
at one end.  The other end seems to be a wildly imagined &quot;never sleep  <br/>
until you pass out, watch TV as much as possible, and eat whatever  <br/>
you can find as constantly as you want.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Creating an unschooling nest for learning about food and sleep and  <br/>
all should involve soft, clean beds and interesting homemade food  <br/>
easily available, and a comfortable place to watch TV with a batter  <br/>
in the remote and maybe a table with some art supplies in there too.<br/>
<br/>
Making it easy for kids to eat and sleep and play and learn doesn&#39;t  <br/>
need to involve a crazed dash toward limitless &quot;freedom.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Choices and options in the hundreds is way more freedom than &quot;Sit  <br/>
like I told you to sit and eat what I told you to eat, or else.&quot;  But  <br/>
it can create a  muddle to think of it as &quot;no limits.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
I am agnostic/atheist and I do take my kids to church when I go with my husband ( who is a Church going man).<br/>
I do not FEAR it.<br/>
My kids do not want to do drugs or go see abortions but they want to see TV and eat sugar stuff ( they are eating jelly rings right now.<br/>
I do not fear sugar or TV.<br/>
MY 2 year old daughter Gigi has been wanting the Sleeping Beauty horse for 4  or more months now.<br/>
Yesterday we went to Target again just to see the horse. She has been waiting for it. We have bought other stuff for her she wanted but now <br/>
she really wants the horse and just 10 minutes ago jumped on my lap and told me that.<br/>
I was going to wait for Christmas to give her the horse ( we are pretty broke this year).<br/>
But I am just going to see if I can get it to her  before that.<br/>
I do not fear consumerism on my children. I have always given anything they ask for if we could afford.<br/>
They are  amazingly patient and wonderful about getting things and waiting and choosing what they want most.<br/>
I thing all this is about FEAR. <br/>
Why would you FEAR TV?<br/>
or Sugar?<br/>
People live with those fears and that holds them back in their life. When you unschool you need to be willing to<br/>
question those fears. IF you live with them you just make your world a lot smaller.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not Pagan, but I&#39;ve read my kids Bible stories and more often  <br/>
just told them Bible stories.  Some of those stories are peachy-keen  <br/>
Bible stories.  The only reason for a Pagan to have a fear or  <br/>
aversion of Bible stories is if they secretly think they&#39;re true, or  <br/>
somehow separate from the secular history of the world.  The FACT  <br/>
that one explanation for different languages is that it was to keep  <br/>
people from working together to reach as high as where God lives is a  <br/>
good thing to know.  The fact that there are flood stories in many  <br/>
cultures is cool to know when geological evidence of a huge flood in  <br/>
the Middle East comes along.   Ideas about what happens after death  <br/>
are common to all people, because people try to make sense of things.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a twenty-questions-meme-thing going around I filled out on my  <br/>
blog today, and one question was about &quot;superstition.&quot;  I answered it  <br/>
like this:<br/>
<br/>
14. Why do people still believe in the supernatural?<br/>
Lightning, thunders, darkness, wind, sun, fear of lack of water, fear  <br/>
of too much water. Elemental forces and people&#39;s natural urge to find  <br/>
patterns.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve offered to take my kids to church.  When we go to a wedding or a  <br/>
funeral, I coach them on expected behaviors in different kinds of  <br/>
churches.  Holly and I have gone just to go.  She&#39;s gone with other  <br/>
families.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t expect a vegetarian to bring hot dogs home, but I wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
say &quot;good idea!&quot; if a vegetarian told a child &quot;hot dogs will kill you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I had a friend in college who was raised by a unitarian mother and an  <br/>
agnostic-to-atheist physicist father, in Los Alamos, New Mexico, in  <br/>
the 60&#39;s.  It was a hive of geekdom.  I lived down the hill in  <br/>
Española, in normal-world.<br/>
<br/>
We were in college, and English majors, and he was quite handicapped  <br/>
by the fact that he didn&#39;t know ANY Bible stories.  He didn&#39;t know  <br/>
Job from Jonah, and had NO idea what Isaac would&#39;ve been doing with a  <br/>
knife and his son tied up.  A reference to Jacob and Esau came up in  <br/>
a class and he was like a deer in the headlights.  I, meanwhile,  <br/>
having grown up with the Bible and the King James Bible, was skating  <br/>
through Shakespeare classes like I was a native of the 17th century  <br/>
(relative to my friend Derek, anyway).  I never forgot a well-read  <br/>
adult being so profoundly ignorant of stories that are the basis of  <br/>
Judaism, Christianity and Islam.  Not good.<br/>
<br/>
So if any of you have been hiding from the Bible, don&#39;t be that way.   <br/>
At least find some story books. If you want to balance out stories of  <br/>
heaven or hell with stories of Valhalla or the boatman at the River  <br/>
Styx, or if you want to balance  baby Jesus stories with baby Krishna  <br/>
or The Great Pumpkin, it&#39;s better than not saying anything at all.<br/>
<br/>
Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat is happy and painless  <br/>
and it might be fun for you to look up &quot;the real story&quot; (or what you  <br/>
might have in a Bible, Torah or Koran near you).  The coolest  <br/>
difference for me is the way Joseph revealed himself to them in the  <br/>
Bible, and how  he knew so much about them while they were relatively  <br/>
clueless:  They were speaking Hebrew, which he understood.  He only  <br/>
spoke Egyptian in front of them the whole first visit and sent them  <br/>
back to Canaan to bring their father.  He kept one brother as a  <br/>
hostage.  The musical simplifies that into a beautiful short version,  <br/>
but the long version is very cool, too.<br/>
<br/>
There was an interview with Ted Neely who plays Jesus in Jesus Christ  <br/>
Superstar.  A TV interviewer in Florida was asking him about the  <br/>
differences between the musical then (in the 70&#39;s) and now.  He said  <br/>
when it was  new it was considered blasphemous, and now it&#39;s like a  <br/>
spiritual Sesame Street.<br/>

<br/>
Rowan is in the midst of a fascination with gods. All of them. Doesn&#39;t<br/>
matter what flavor, denomination, color, creed, race... he thinks they&#39;re<br/>
all fabulous. He&#39;s constantly asking me what the god of something-or-other<br/>
is. The other day he asked about a god for the computer, and I was able to<br/>
pull St. Vidicon of Cathode out of the mix. =)<br/>
<br/>
I was raised completely openly about religion. We went to every church in<br/>
town, and discussed the differences and similarities. I&#39;ve read most of the<br/>
major books, and dabbled in the communities that spring up around most<br/>
faiths. My husband, OTOH, was raised by evangelical Nazarenes, and when<br/>
Rowan started asking about gods, his own reaction was so visceral and so<br/>
negative, he had to excuse himself from the room so I could handle the<br/>
discussion with equanimity.<br/>
<br/>
For me, learning about religions, all of them, is a lot like learning about<br/>
the food of a given culture. You can&#39;t understand a people unless you know<br/>
what they eat, and why, and having at least a general idea about the<br/>
predominant faiths a culture holds really makes a huge difference in how<br/>
culturally sensitive and understanding you can be. So restricting<br/>
information about religion, just because it&#39;s got so much potential for<br/>
hot-buttoning, is really hobbling.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree that a lot of arbitrary limits are based on fear.  But I was <br/>
talking about well thought out, researched, questioned things, that a <br/>
parent still believes to be harmful.  Obviously, you don&#39;t believe <br/>
church is harmful.  I think it depends on the church, but some people <br/>
think any of it is harmful. <br/>
<br/>
But whether or not you or I or anyone else agree&#39;s on *what* is <br/>
harmful, we all believe *something* to be harmful, and don&#39;t <br/>
intentionally expose our kids to it.  But as unschoolers, when our <br/>
kids are confronted with these things as we go about exciting, <br/>
interesting lives, we can then choose to have no arbitrary limits.  <br/>
Then we can discuss them with our kids, and partner with them in <br/>
navigating those things.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t intentionally expose my 3 year old to Paganism.  To me, this <br/>
is no different than the parent who doesn&#39;t intentionally expose her <br/>
3 year old to tv.  If both choices are well-thought out, researched <br/>
and often questioned.  I don&#39;t agree with that parent&#39;s beliefs about <br/>
tv, but I can respect the choice.  <br/>
<br/>
I think the test comes when my child says &quot;My friend told me about <br/>
Paganism, and I think it&#39;s cool.&quot;  Am I going to say &quot;We don&#39;t <br/>
believe in that!  You can&#39;t see that kid anymore!&quot;?  Or am I going to <br/>
partner with her to navigate what she believes.  Or when the parent <br/>
with no tv has her kid come to her and say &quot;I saw Spongebob at my <br/>
friend&#39;s house.  I want a tv!&quot;  Is she going to say &quot;No, tv is bad!&quot;  <br/>
Or is she going to partner with her child?</div>

I don&#39;t like the &quot;intentional exposure&quot; construct you have going  <br/>

What she believes won&#39;t be something that needs to be navigated.  It  <br/>

For the purposes of these discussions, only the kind of parenting  <br/>
that helps  unschooling work is worthy of discussion.  And I would  <br/>
hope an unschooling parent isn&#39;t having an adversarial relationship  <br/>
with the child in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I was playing devil&#39;s advocate with Bible story/church thing. I  <br/>
know Pagans who avoid any hint of Christianity like the plague (no  <br/>
pun intended). So naturally they are wary of me. For the record, I&#39;m  <br/>
a Messianic Christian. -=-<br/>
<br/>
As much as possible, please try to speak from personal experience and  <br/>
don&#39;t play devil&#39;s advocate.  Sometimes it&#39;s useful, but I think if  <br/>
you can move away from the idea of &quot;intentionally exposing a child&quot;  <br/>
to something it might help.<br/>

This statement is true:<br/>
-=-Unschooling is bringing the world to them - thinking about<br/>
what might interest them and exposing them to it.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It still reminds me of people &quot;exposing themselves&quot; to things. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Creating a rich environment doesn&#39;t need to include cupcakes with  <br/>
nuts, and it doesn&#39;t need to include neo-Paganism treated with more  <br/>
gravity than it deserves, and it doesn&#39;t have to include anything  <br/>
graphic about abortion.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, a sanitized version of the world is not &quot;rich.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And a version of the world that includes all of the mother&#39;s fears  <br/>
and prejudices and dire warnings and &quot;truths&quot; becomes either a  <br/>
curriculum or a polluted version of the world.<br/>
<br/>
Children aren&#39;t the only ones to learn when a learning environment is  <br/>
created!<br/>

I have said sometimes, when people have likened what I do to what  <br/>
conservative school-at-home families do that some people homeschool  <br/>
because they think schools are presenting their kids with too much  <br/>
information.  Others do so because they think the schools aren&#39;t  <br/>
presenting enough.<br/>

a trigger for me, wastefulness and environmental issues at the fore. <br/>
When my children go to the store to purchase something, I keep my mouth<br/>
shut about it.<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;m disassembling all the paper product from plastic (think barbies<br/>
here), it takes me a long time, and the kids notice.  On one b-day, my<br/>
daughter received several barbie/bratz type things, and it took me<br/>
literally 2 hrs to open them all and seperate the recycling from the<br/>
garbage.<br/>
<br/>
I could make it a big ethical environmental issue.  I could boycott<br/>
those products.  I could write the companies that do that.  I could give<br/>
charitable donations to companies that work on my behalf to get those<br/>
companies to stop.  I could seek out similar toys with less packaging. <br/>
I have a TON of choices.  The one I won&#39;t sacrifice is my children&#39;s<br/>
happiness in purchasing and enjoying those things.  I&#39;m not even going<br/>
to put my negative voice into the purchase of those things because I<br/>
dislike the packaging.<br/>
<br/>
My kids KNOW that I feel strongly about environmental issues and ethical<br/>
consumerism because I seek out the more ethical choices when I make my<br/>
own purchases and I recycle and do as much as I can in that end.  We<br/>
talk about it.  One day, they may adopt my ideals, and one day they may<br/>
decide that I was too extreme about it and relax on it in their own<br/>
lives.  Either way, they will have each made a knowledgable choice for<br/>
themselves, just like I did.</div>

The rest of the stuff was split into plastic recycling or paper.   <br/>
There&#39;s burnable paper and trash paper and recycling paper (different  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I think it different in a couple of ways.  &quot;Paganism&quot; isn&#39;t a thing.   <br/>
It&#39;s not a seashell or a banana.  You can&#39;t possibly discuss paganism  <br/>
in any historical concept with a three year old.<br/>
<br/>
People don&#39;t expose three year olds to sex or reproduction, generally  <br/>
speaking, but if a three year old asks about babies being born, there  <br/>
are simple, brief responses that will answer them honestly without a  <br/>
world of discussion, which they wouldn&#39;t understand anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Today Holly asked about Socialism.  She&#39;s seventeen, and she asked.   <br/>
I didn&#39;t &quot;expose her to Socialism&quot; when she was three, but it&#39;s  <br/>
because it&#39;s not something she could have begun to grasp.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
TV, on the other hand is not a philosophical construct with  <br/>
associated behaviors.  TV is a medium and a tool and a portal.  To  <br/>
hide TV from a child in this culture would be like hiding books and  <br/>
all printed word from a child in this culture, or to hide all  <br/>
recorded sound.<br/>

Expose and exposure aren&#39;t right or wrong words, it&#39;s just that if  <br/>

better to not say anything about it.  Margaux is a good reminder that<br/>
things that I consider useless or garbage, she absolutely doesn&#39;t.  She<br/>
likes to save the cardboard back drops and some of the little plastic<br/>
things and creates uses for them.<br/>

hangups about things and call it bad and place limits on them and push<br/>
their own ideas harshly onto their children, even when their intentions<br/>
may be good or sound reasonable.  I&#39;ve seen how my kids look at the<br/>
world in a totally different way than I do, and a lot of times it&#39;s way<br/>
happier and more fun than my own outlook!<br/>

those internal &quot;no&quot; or &quot;can&#39;t&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; that sometimes pops into our<br/>
parent brains that have in, varying degrees, conditioned responses to<br/>
things, whatever those things may be, surely different for different<br/>
individuals!</div>

 </span></blockquote>Well, I used to believe all kinds of things that I thought were good and<br/>
right to limit, when I had one 3 yr old.  I found unschooling when that<br/>
3 yr old turned 5.<br/>
<br/>
From that point forward I worked to make unschooling work better.  When<br/>
she was 7, then 8, then 9, I had a baby that turned 1, then 2, and is<br/>
now 7.  All those things that I believed should be limited with my first<br/>
3 yr old, I&#39;d let go of by the time my second was 3yrs old.  There was<br/>
no way in the world I could parent her in that same way because she was<br/>
in a house with an older kid who I found ways to be inclusive with.<br/>
<br/>
My second child has been a part of a household with a much older child,<br/>
doing things and being exposed to things that a lot of first or only<br/>
children at the age of 3 aren&#39;t doing and being exposed to.  I&#39;ve seen<br/>
how it has made for a different experience, one worth looking at and<br/>
exploring.<br/>
<br/>
If you can&#39;t imagine limiting sugar when your child is a teenager, then<br/>
why would you do it when they are little?  Sure, teens, are bigger and<br/>
make bigger and better decisions because they&#39;re brains are more<br/>
developed.  I live in a house with one little kid and one teenager, it<br/>
would be really hard to tell one kid they could do something and one<br/>
not.  So, the focus really has to be on what one likes and dislikes and<br/>
what works for one and what doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
There will inherently be things they don&#39;t like the same as each other. <br/>
For a while I couldn&#39;t take them both to the mall together, their needs<br/>
didn&#39;t mesh well at the mall, so we did other things and I took them<br/>
seperately to the mall.  The same goes for movies.  My younger daughter<br/>
has watched way more PG-13 and R rated movies than my older daughter<br/>
ever did when she was that age!  That doesn&#39;t mean she always wants to<br/>
do that though, mostly she likes age appropriate things.  The focus is<br/>
on wether or not she&#39;ll like it though, and not wether or not it&#39;s<br/>
&quot;good&quot; for her.<br/>

and can magically or psychically or subliminally take control of a  <br/>
child&#39;s mind in evil ways. Maybe your choice of example is that, too.  <br/>
I mean, maybe you chose that example (not introducing your child to  <br/>
Paganism) because of that same kind of fear.<br/>
<br/>
In that case, yeah, I guess you understand it &lt;G&gt;, but it doesn&#39;t mean  <br/>
it is good for unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
In my experience, everyone does not have those kinds of irrational  <br/>
fears.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And maybe to offer a different perspective on tv, sugar and<br/>
&gt; all the other things we consciously or unconsciously limit.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t doubt that people who limit sugar and TV and access to other  <br/>
religious beliefs and so on have what they believe are good reasons  <br/>
for the limitations they impose.<br/>
<br/>
But sometimes those reasons don&#39;t have a foundation of thought  <br/>
beneath them. They might be doing what has always been done because  <br/>
they assume there&#39;s a good reason someone decided to do it that way.  <br/>
(School, imposed bedtimes, 3 square meals a day, brushing twice a  <br/>
day.) They might be going along with what they&#39;ve heard because it  <br/>
sounds sensible and imposing limits is a lot easier than delving into  <br/>
research they&#39;re not confident they can interpret objectively. (It  <br/>
*does* sound reasonable that exposure a lot of ads will cause kids to  <br/>
want a lot of things, and that candy will make them ignore more  <br/>
nutritious food (we can even see that happening if controls are  <br/>
lifted at Halloween and kids pig out.)<br/>
<br/>
And sometimes those reasons are based on fear. Sometimes fear can  <br/>
cause people to research to support their fear rather than understand  <br/>
what they fear better and see the situation more objectively.  <br/>
Sometimes the information itself is skewed because the only ones  <br/>
writing and researching are those who are afraid.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, it&#39;s much easier to find research on the negative  <br/>
effects of television than on the positive effects. It&#39;s much easier  <br/>
to find articles on how bad sugar is than to find articles on why you  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t worry. It&#39;s much easier to find the negative effects of  <br/>
secularism than the positive effects.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s much easier and more comforting to build protective walls  <br/>
against what we fear than to face the fears and find out the truth.<br/>
<br/>
I think when unschoolers start arguing against limiting TV what  <br/>
people believe we&#39;re saying is that our opinion is better than yours  <br/>
and you need to keep your opinion to yourself about TV and sugar and  <br/>
plastic.<br/>
<br/>
But what we&#39;re doing is reporting what *really* happens when kids are  <br/>
free to explore the world in a supportive home, and free to use and  <br/>
refine their own internal guides in an environment where parents are  <br/>
there to help them make decisions. (Not make the decision we want  <br/>
them to, but make their own decisions.)<br/>
<br/>
What we pass on about TV and video games and candy isn&#39;t what we  <br/>
guess will happen. It&#39;s not what we hope will happen while we look  <br/>
through unschooling rosy glasses. It&#39;s what actually does happen. And  <br/>
then also our best guesses at why unschoolers get different results  <br/>
than what conventional parents fear will happen (and sometimes see  <br/>
happen).<br/>
<br/>
There are vegetarian parents who help their kids explore the world of  <br/>
food without forcing them or guilting them into becoming vegetarians.<br/>
<br/>
There are parents who dislike TV who find a way to see TV through  <br/>
their kids and see the benefits of it. (And their kids don&#39;t end up  <br/>
watching porn at 6!)<br/>
<br/>
I remember at least one fundamentalist Christian who said she wasn&#39;t  <br/>
forcing her beliefs on her kids and was allowing them to make up  <br/>
their own minds about religion.<br/>
<br/>
Fear is not a good mix to add to unschooling. Even fear of school is  <br/>
not good. It narrows the world when we need to open doors for kids.<br/>

***... the parent who doesn&#39;t intentionally expose her<br/>

<br/>
It seems unkind to deliberately keep information of interest from someone else.   Man, wouldn&#39;t parents be disgusted if a kid failed to share some important or interesting information with them?  &quot;The bank called, your account is overdrawn.&quot;  &quot;Aunt Persnickety is coming over tomorrow at 7:00 AM.&quot;  &quot;Stephanie Staphylococcus was here and tried on all your clothes.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
I know there were millions of things I failed to introduce to my son because I never knew or thought of them and I can tell you my failure and ignorance never did a thing to make my sons life better.   <br/>
When we can we should always do more, offer more, think more, and make our bit of the world as big and full as we can for our kids.  Our kid&#39;s lives get bigger and better when our thinking gets bigger and better.   <br/>

There&#39;s a difference, though, between ancient history and the fabric  <br/>
of culture and language,  and recently-reconstituted &quot;ancient&quot;  <br/>
religions.  Christianity is certainly not additive free nor  <br/>
homogenous.  It might not be worth exploring with every three year  <br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t hide from Paganism.  I know pagans, and as I said before, they <br/>
are wary of me because I&#39;m a Christian, but I have no problem with <br/>
them.  I gladly let my kids play with theirs.  Obviously, I know that <br/>
paganism has historical value, and every day context.  And, like I said <br/>
in another post, if my kid comes home and says &quot;Mom, my friend told me <br/>
about their beliefs and I think it&#39;s cool!&quot;  We&#39;d go find out more!  <br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m not going to take my 3 year old to a Pagan coven to see one of <br/>
their rituals, when there are so many other exciting and interesting <br/>
things to do to keep our lives rich and full.  Someday, sure.  At some <br/>
point she will be interested in what other people believe and why and <br/>
then we&#39;ll go explore it all.  But not now.   <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this whole thing started out having nothing to do with <br/>
Paganism.  I just used that as an example, though obviously a bad one.</div>
