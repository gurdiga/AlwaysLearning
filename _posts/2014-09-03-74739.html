-=-&lt;&lt;Nobody loves my children more than me.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One of the greatest hopes I have for my son is that he will be well loved, both by me and by every other good-hearted person he invites into his life.  If they love him more than me, I will consider him well blessed indeed.  Open your heart to include a whole lot of love for your children.  Allow it to be bigger than you.  I can think of no greater gift.  At the very least consider that your wife, the mother of your children, at least loves the kids as much as you.  I find it difficult to believe you would choose to bring five lives into this world without that condition being true.<br/>
<br/>
Many years ago a very young homeschooling mom (Christian, school-at-home) wrote something like &quot;Just think!  You will be your child&#39;s only teacher!&quot;  She thought it was fantastic.<br/>
<br/>
The (few) unschoolers in the group said it might be better to hope kids would learn from everyone around them, but there is a huge fear in some homeschooling families that is really the reason they&#39;ve kept their kids home.  They don&#39;t WANT other people having any influence over them.<br/>
<br/>
If someone loves one of my children more than I do, in the long run, that&#39;s what&#39;s going to make a good, strong marriage.  Marty&#39;s getting married in two months.  I hope his new wife will love him more than Keith and I do.  <br/>
<br/>
But she won&#39;t have the baby, or the toddler, or the boy.  The ghosts of all the previous stages of Marty are mineâ€”my memories, my visions.  And I loved him in a biological way unmatched by just about anything in my life.  But if I&#39;m the tree and he&#39;s the fruit, the purpose is that he will find another tree.  Or something. :-)<br/>

<br/>
Yes.  Set the bar high and hope for someone to break your record. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Make your homelife great so that only a better offer will lure your kids away.<br/>
