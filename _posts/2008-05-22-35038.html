<div id="ygrps-yiv-803311152">I think literally, to bash is to create a concavity in something.  I  <br/>
could be wrong.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a report that someone was bashed recently on &quot;my  <br/>
forum&quot; (meaning, I guess, SandraDodd.com) but I don&#39;t see how that  <br/>
could be.    I think some people call &quot;bash&quot; when anyone fails to coo  <br/>
tea-party-like about their ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, here&#39;s the report.  I&#39;m sure no one was treated this badly on  <br/>
any forum I was in or involved with:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;KathyJo I just wanted to say I agree with you 100%. I happen to like  <br/>
the term horseshit quite well. Very fitting actually. Have you ever  <br/>
been over to Sandraï¿½s unschoolers forum? If not you really should go  <br/>
check it out. A friend of mine sent me a link to it a couple of weeks  <br/>
ago because she got completely bashed there for making a suggestiong  <br/>
regarding healthy food. I thought that in this day and age nothing  <br/>
could shock me. I was wrong. Horseshit on top of horseshit smoothered  <br/>
in horseshit.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the final word on the forum from which I was banished, because  <br/>
the blog owner has promised to delete any future comments.<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, I think her whole attack on Zach&#39;s writings will backfire  <br/>
for her and introduce dozens or maybe hundreds of people to peaceful  <br/>
ideas they NEVER would&#39;ve gotten from conservative blogs or church.   <br/>
It couldn&#39;t possibly have made the blog author any friends (not  <br/>
counting one or two who went there because they heard there was blood  <br/>
and they like to be ringside at fights).  I just don&#39;t feel like the  <br/>
blood was any of mine, nor the horseshit either.<br/>
