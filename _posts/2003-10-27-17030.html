<div id="ygrps-yiv-1617974087">Hi Everyone!<br/>
<br/>
Though I don&#39;t often post much, I&#39;d like to get some advice from you guys. It doesn&#39;t really relate <br/>
to unschooling, per se, but then again, I think to most of us, just about everything pertaining to <br/>
life is unschooling. (yada, yada, yada :-) ) I have a friend who will be needing to furnish a house <br/>
from scratch. (man, I don&#39;t even want to _think_ about a job that big) He&#39;s got a twelve yo daughter <br/>
(and 10yo son) who&#39;d like to learn to cook and &#39;thinks&#39; vegetarian. (mom died a while back :-( ) <br/>
Anyway, I&#39;d like to get them a house warming/christmas gift for the kitchen. Since he&#39;s a guy and <br/>
doesn&#39;t do all that much cooking (and for that matter neither do I), I thought I&#39;d ask... What would <br/>
be the thing you use the most or maybe not use alot but really glad you have it anyway. Or something <br/>
on your wish list... I&#39;d like to get them something nice.  I was thinking about maybe a food <br/>
processor - cuisinart? or a set of good knives - Henckels? Or even a favorite little gadget. Any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
Something that would also be helpful would be links to get those kind of things at good prices and <br/>
places with good clearance sales...  you get the idea. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much,<br/>

Crock pot.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could get him a big crockpot and a good cookbook for it (or <br/>
two or three used ones!  Or collect people&#39;s crock pot recipes from <br/>
here and make him a set of cards.  Or from webpages of recipes...<br/>
<br/>
I use my crock pot lots, and my mom asked for one lately and I got <br/>
her a four quart (she lives alone) for $10 and it&#39;s really nice!!  I <br/>
almost got one for me even though I have a six quart that works fine.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1476623244">I agree with the idea of a food processor - I use mine all the time.   If they are cooking vegetarian, a modern pressure cooker and pressure cooker cook book (Lorna Sass has an excellent one) is a marvel -- beans without soaking in an hour or so, risotto without stirring, 5 minute lentil soup -- also a thing I use all the time.  Other things I use frequently, an electric rice cooker, garlic press, pizza peel and baking tiles, vitamix blender (I am the queen of gadgets).  Good cook books or subscription to a cooking magazine.  Some really great spices from a good spice company (like Penseys). <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-64780879">Ok, I thought about it, and this is my favorite thing:  &quot;The Best  <br/>
Recipe&quot; by Cooks Illustrated &lt;  <br/>

<br/>
Basically they tried 30-40-50+ different ways of making a lot of basic  <br/>
stuff (sauteed chicken, creme brulee, pizza, etc), and devised the best  <br/>
recipe from all their experience.  You can read pages of background to  <br/>
hear about the trial and error, or just follow the recipe.  My mom and  <br/>
I both have it and literally EVERY recipe we&#39;ve tried has been a keeper.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-747563374">How about a smoothie maker.  The one I saw was at Kitchen, etc. and basically looks like a blender with a spout.  My kids love smoothies, especially in the summer.  I think they enjoy it so much because they get to put the ingredients in by themselves (relatively easy) and they really enjoy the fact that they can try different things. Also, I think a pizza stone is great too.  Hope this helps.<br/>

(By the way, we have one of those smoothie makers with the spout.  (It was $40-50 at Target.)  We&#39;ve had it for 3 weeks.  It does a good job making smoothies.  But the spout often leaks.  So a blender might be a better bet.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-45323844">Pressure cookers could not be easier.  Put the stuff in, lock the lid on, cook on high until it comes to pressure (a little knob pops up to tell you that), cook on low until done (that&#39;s where the recipe book comes in.).  Unlike the rattly, prone to split peas on teh ceiling pressure cookers of your grandmother, the modern ones are an amazing marvel.  LOL -- maybe I should do ads for them. <br/>
<br/>
My favorite cookware catalogs are Williams Sonoma and The Bakers Catalog from King Arthur Flour and the Penseys Spices catalog.  I mentioned spices before, I think, but I wanted to add that if your only experience with spices are McCormicks from the grocery store -- the difference quality spices makes is enormous. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-704841073">-=- What would<br/>
be the thing you use the most or maybe not use alot<br/>
but really glad <br/>
you have it<br/>
anyway.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I cook a lot and we make most things from scratch. <br/>
I&#39;m not a gadgety person myself (though I would love a<br/>
vitamix) and just use a pot to cook rice and a knife<br/>
or blender to &quot;process food.&quot;  I do use a crockpot a<br/>
fair amount.  A good set of knives and a good set of<br/>
pots and pans are two absolute necessities in any<br/>
kitchen, and people have different qualifications for<br/>
what constitutes a &quot;good set.&quot;  But what I might find<br/>
a necessity, another might find a dust gathering<br/>
mystery.<br/>
<br/>
So my advice would be make your selection based on<br/>
what you know of the family.  Some people don&#39;t do<br/>
well with cookbooks of certain formats, or are not as<br/>
linquistically inclined and find following a recipe<br/>
bothersome.  They like to experiement.  Which type of<br/>
personality is he, adventurous and experimental or<br/>
careful and precise?  What do they like to cook and<br/>
eat at home generally?  If the dad doesn&#39;t cook much,<br/>
what does he like to eat?  What do the kids like to<br/>
eat?  Where do they go out to eat if/when they do go<br/>
out?  People usually cook what they like to eat, and<br/>
go from there.  If they like pasta, get him some good<br/>
tools for cooking or serving it.  If he likes a<br/>
certain type of ethnic food, cookbooks and tools for<br/>
making that.  If he likes quick meals try a blender or<br/>
pressure cooker and recipes for smoothies or soups and<br/>
things.  If he likes easy cooking and is patient, a<br/>
crock pot.  <br/>
<br/>
Generally the best things to have in the kitchen are<br/>
A: well made to withstand the abuses of cooking and <br/>
B: easy to use and clean.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the best gift for him, if he&#39;s really a babe in<br/>
the woods in the kitchen, would be some lessons in<br/>
cooking fun and easy meals that he and his family will<br/>
enjoy.  Some fun dinners getting everyone involved in<br/>
the cooking and sending them home (or leaving them<br/>
with, if they are at their home) recipes and maybe a<br/>
small gift or two for making each dish might be a more<br/>
memorable and fun gift.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

use.  I think the kind that chirp when the waffles are ready are great.<br/>
<br/>
My food processor has a regular blade for chopping, a grating one and a <br/>
slicing one.  I use all three regularly.  We went for a second bowl, too, which has <br/>
been helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Now if only I had a place to put all my appliances without them being on the <br/>
counter all the time!<br/>

<br/>
  Excellent ideas...<br/>
  Helpful hints and useful/handy features are a plus.<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;&gt;a smoothie maker<br/>
    &gt;&gt;Braun Multimix<br/>
    &gt;&gt;&quot;The Best Recipe&quot; by Cooks Illustrated<br/>
    &gt;&gt;a big crockpot and a good cookbook for it--<br/>
<br/>
      &gt;&gt;I&#39;ll second that idea.  Make sure the crock comes out of the electric part<br/>
      &gt;&gt;of the pot, though, or they&#39;re a pain to clean.<br/>
<br/>
  Absolutely. The crock definitely needs to come out.  And how does one clean a waffle iron if the<br/>
  grids don&#39;t come out??<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;&gt;a food processor<br/>
<br/>
  One I saw had extra blades to buy. Is that really necessary? The ones it comes with aren&#39;t enough?<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;&gt;a modern pressure cooker and pressure cooker cook book<br/>
<br/>
  Not too tricky for novice cooks?<br/>
<br/>
  One more request? --<br/>
<br/>
  What&#39;s your favorite cookware catalog? (He is going to have to do a lot of shopping) Some how we <br/>
  were sent a &quot;Chef&#39;s&quot; catalog and wow it has some nice stuff. I&#39;m having fun making my own wish list. <br/>
  :-) I so much prefer browsing through catalogs than navigating web pages. But I&#39;ve found pretty good <br/>
  bargain and clearance sections online.<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks everybody!<br/>

Hahahahahah!!! Wow! Mine didn&#39;t do that and with the _cement_ like seal of the waffle that was left, <br/>
I _really_ almost threw it out the window!! (but I hate replacing glass...) I let it soak and washed <br/>
it and let it soak and washed it again. Though (!), I think I might not have heated it up enough, so <br/>
it was probably my fault. (!) And it (miraculously) has worked well since. :-)<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>ok. what is the deal with these? I have one (pampered chef also). Tried to use it to make pizza on, <br/>
followed the directions, crust stuck to the thing - again - like _cement_! Then I put a frozen pizza <br/>
on it and the middle was still cold and the edges were on the verge of being overdone. Ugh! What <br/>
gives?? I can&#39;t preheat the thing for homemade pizza, since I&#39;m not a throw-in-the-air type of crust <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1668590902">Yeah - you&#39;ve got to preheat them.  Can you push the crust down into the pan and then put the pan on the heated pizza stone?  I roll my crusts out onto unbleached parchment adn slide the whole thing (parchment and all) onto the stone using my wooden peel.  Then after a couple of minutes I pull the parchment paper out (otherwise it starts to singe and stink). <br/>
<br/>
I also use the pizza tiles on my gas grill and have grilled pizza in the summer -- it&#39;s great not to heat up the kitchen. <br/>

I love all my stoneware from pampered chef. I&#39;ve never had any problem with <br/>
it, I just had to get over the idea of hot water and a good scrub and that is <br/>
it for cleaning. &lt;g&gt; I have slowly replaced all my baking ware with the <br/>
stoneware. I never preheat it and all my pizzas, cookies, casseroles, roasted fowl <br/>
... comes out golden. Love it!<br/>
