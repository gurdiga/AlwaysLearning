Always Learning list, just a minute ago.<br/>
<br/>
I thought that looked cool, 9 and 99.<br/>
Not very important.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had lots of snow here.  It snowed again last night.  Sometimes  <br/>
there&#39;s a moment or something really interesting or beautiful, but  <br/>
photos don&#39;t really do it justice.  By the time I post this, the 9  <br/>
and 99 will be gone, if not by my posting, by someone else&#39;s posting  <br/>
or joining the list.<br/>
<br/>
Those fleeting moments can be shared with our kids, too.  If they  <br/>
say, &quot;Mom, come look!&quot;  go and look.  Don&#39;t wait.  Some things can&#39;t  <br/>
wait.<br/>

some snow photos, which are only pale representations of the snow<br/>
