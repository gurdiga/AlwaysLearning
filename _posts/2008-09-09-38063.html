<div id="ygrps-yiv-1069302685">I&#39;ve been seeing a trend of giving up on social life among unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
As for my rut, watching tv and being on the computer, I&#39;m alone<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; during the day hours. Jeffrey (12) prefers staying in his room all<br/>
&gt; day playing his video games, legos, or being on his computer. He<br/>
&gt; prefers not to go out of the house unless absolutely necessary.<br/>
&gt; Allie (10) is a night owl and stays up until 2am or 3am and then<br/>
&gt; sleeps 12 hours. When she wakes up in the afternoon, she likes to<br/>
&gt; watch tv and snack for an hour or so. She&#39;s ready to go do something<br/>
&gt; out of the house around dinner time. Claire (16) sleeps until lunch,<br/>
&gt; hangs out on her computer, and waits for her boyfriend to get out of<br/>
&gt; school at 3:30pm.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not always easy to keep being positive when you&#39;re waiting for results<br/>
to come in after putting out feelers to make a social life.  But if there&#39;s<br/>
little being done by the parent(s) to encourage the results then the results<br/>
aren&#39;t likely to magically be encouraging all on their own.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s much easier to feel despondent and give up.<br/>
<br/>
But if I do that, I *know* without any doubt that Karl will go to school.<br/>

unschoolers.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I live in a part of the country where there are isolated ranches, and  <br/>
used to be way more of them.  My grandmother lived with her siblings  <br/>
and parents and an uncle or two way far from towns in southern New  <br/>
Mexico when she was little.  She was super excited to go to high  <br/>
school (I used to think in Carizozo, but I think maybe in Lincoln and  <br/>
maybe Carizozo was their grocery store town...  I should ask one of  <br/>
my great aunts before it&#39;s too late).<br/>
<br/>
They hung around with their siblings and other relatives, and their  <br/>
dog and their horses.<br/>
<br/>
Is it a part of deschooling we&#39;ve been missing, maybe, that makes  <br/>
people feel like they need to find unschoolers to hang around with or  <br/>
they&#39;ll have no life at all?    Leaving school to live in the real  <br/>
world shouldn&#39;t mean leaving school-world to live in unschooling-world.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think there *is* an unschooling-world except in isolated pockets.<br/>
And I also think it&#39;s *isolating* to only be around other unschoolers and no<br/>
one else, even when that&#39;s possible.  Smacks way too much of my own highly<br/>
sheltered childhood in a rural Christian home in the South.  Not something I<br/>
want to replicate by substituting unschooling for Christianity.<br/>
<br/>
I do think though that unschoolers want an unschooling-friendly social<br/>
life.  That part I think is important.  And it&#39;s a lot easier to find<br/>
unschooling-friendly groups than it is to find an unschooling-world.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s school or not (don&#39;t think so), but I have heard things<br/>
like &quot;we hit it right off&quot; (and there&#39;s nothing wrong with the sentiment).<br/>
Like a cliche.  Or the opposite assumption that if you don&#39;t click then it&#39;s<br/>
not meant to happen.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that and a similar kind of thing can become glib expectations that if<br/>
friends and social life aren&#39;t automatic then one isn&#39;t good at it or others<br/>
are somehow not up to par or something like that.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t attribute that stuff to school but it&#39;s everywhere ... such that<br/>
nobody finds it remarkable.<br/>
<br/>
It can be another false meme to be aware of.  It *is* possible for people to<br/>
change, or become more like minded with others, to grow in more or less<br/>
even/uneven patterns with their friends (past and present).  It&#39;s also<br/>
possible for people lives to become more fleshed out for others, and we can<br/>
learn cool things about them we didn&#39;t know before hanging out with them.<br/>
We can&#39;t know any of that if we don&#39;t spend enough time to find it out.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe people get so careful or busy or whatever that very little happens to<br/>
them socially, and this can have a larger effect in a small group or type of<br/>
homeschoolers like unschoolers are.<br/>
<br/>
So of course unschoolers limit themselves severely when they seek out<br/>
unschoolers only for a social life.  And because unschooling takes on<br/>
something very like religious fervor --since it *is* about our dear sweet<br/>
children-- the word unschooler means different things to different people.<br/>
And that&#39;s also part of the social dilemma of finding like minded folks to<br/>
hang out with.<br/>
<br/>
But all that isn&#39;t automatically part of an unschooler&#39;s social dilemma.<br/>
Just as we&#39;re learning to be more aware in our relationship with our<br/>
children, we can become more aware in relationships to others in the wider<br/>
world.<br/>
<br/>
For some people this isn&#39;t anything to think about because they&#39;ve been<br/>
keenly aware socially before they even got to the point of unschooling their<br/>
children.  For others, like me, it *is* something to think about.<br/>
Especially in the context of unschooling which can be seen by so many as<br/>
socially unacceptable if it&#39;s bluntly or ineffectively presented.  That&#39;s<br/>
where I want to be more patient with myself.  I know that once I&#39;m able to<br/>
talk with anyone about our lives (whether or not I mention unschooling),<br/>
I&#39;ll be more comfortable socially.  :)<br/>

dumbfounded!<br/>
<br/>
Then there were the homeschooling groups that had a mix of people.  <br/>
While the kids played in the park, the moms sat together at a table <br/>
and compared notes on curriculum and behavior.  I made the homeschool <br/>
choices (curriculum) I did because of a desire to fit in.  When I&#39;d <br/>
call us unschoolers, I got lots of negative feedback.  The nicest <br/>
thing someone said to me about unschooling was that it was great I <br/>
was doing it with my young kids and how much she (the talker) had <br/>
enjoyed unschooling until they finally reached the age <br/>
where &quot;learning really matters&quot;.  Huh?  <br/>
<br/>
When I finally met another unschooling family, I was actually giddy.  <br/>
It was so nice to talk with another person without talk of <br/>
curriculum, behaviors, coercion methods and preparing for the <br/>
future.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1290408147">Under this subject heading, I have some questions.  What do you, as <br/>
an unschooling parent, do to help your child leave their comfort zone <br/>
to be more social?  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve posted before about my dd10 wanting to be more social.  I was <br/>
told I needed to step out of my comfort zone and learn to be more <br/>
social so my children would have more opportunities to be social.  I <br/>
feel like I&#39;ve done a great deal to find social opportunities and <br/>
none of them have worked out.  I truly do want to give up entirely <br/>
but I don&#39;t share that sentiment with my children.  My son Jeffrey <br/>
(12) doesn&#39;t like being around a bunch of people, or trying new <br/>
things.  Unschoolers have told me that respecting his personally set <br/>
boundaries is important.  <br/>
<br/>
How do I find that fine line between respecting my children&#39;s <br/>
boundaries and helping them step out of their comfort zone?  I feel <br/>
like I&#39;m being told to be different than I am because I&#39;m an adult.  <br/>
It&#39;s not easy for me at all to do things that make me feel <br/>
uncomfortable.  I&#39;ve never been pushed to do uncomfortable things <br/>
until my adult/parenting years.  If my children&#39;s boundaries should <br/>
be respected, why shouldn&#39;t mine be?  <br/>

boring or dry.  I have a nice group here that I go to.  It&#39;s not as active<br/>
as I like.  I don&#39;t want to sit and talk with the ladies and that&#39;s it.  I<br/>
like that but I want to something to *do* too.  I think I learn more about<br/>
people by doing things together.  So I&#39;m starting a CampFire USA club (there<br/>
isn&#39;t a council in South Carolina).  So far so good.. 4 families in a week<br/>
after posting the idea on a local list.<br/>

If a homeschooling group isn&#39;t interesting the reflection on you that you<br/>
are perceiving isn&#39;t about you if you just arrived.  It&#39;s about them.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When we were beginning our unschooling journey, I now realize, I had some<br/>
false ideas about how to put it into practice.  My thoughts revolved around<br/>
what I perceived was disrespectful treatment of my daughter.  I felt no one<br/>
had any rights to infringe upon my daughters autonomy with their rules.<br/>
Which meant no one was ever to say &#39;no&#39; to her, no one was ever to treat her<br/>
in any other way but exactly the way *I* treat her.  Which is different than<br/>
just wanting people to be nice to my child.  It was fear-based, rebellion<br/>
against mainstream parenting.<br/>
<br/>
Now I see that this did her no favors.  It caused us to not have very many<br/>
friends and I was lamenting on the lack of unschoolers or true unschoolers<br/>
near me.  I felt that if we met unschoolers they&#39;d treat us better than<br/>
these &quot;outsiders&quot; have.   When I did meet two other unschooling famlies, I<br/>
didn&#39;t feel they were true unschoolers because both moms had asked their<br/>
children not to do something while we were with them.  I have no idea where<br/>
I got the idea that unschoolers = unparenting, but, there it was.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, from reading here and the discussions in the past about this,<br/>
I&#39;ve changed my thinking.  We currently have quite a few friends that we<br/>
hang out with on a regular basis.  A couple of Unschoolers, a couple<br/>
of Homeschoolers and a montessouri family.  We are open to friendships with<br/>
anyone to whom we feel a connection.  This has widened my children&#39;s world,<br/>
instead of making it smaller.  I still am looking to start an unschooling<br/>
group, meeting at my house maybe once a month.  More if it works out well.<br/>
Unfortunately, we have run into other unparents.  It&#39;s hard to see your<br/>
previous bad behavior right in your face.  I see why others ran from us,<br/>
because my children don&#39;t wish to be treated badly, either.<br/>

<br/>
This is a really good point.<br/>
<br/>
Lifted from the middle of a paragraph, so somewhat out of context but  <br/>
K also wrote:<br/>
<br/>
-=-Especially in the context of unschooling which can be seen by so  <br/>

<br/>
Or if it&#39;s bluntly or ineffectively lived.  Some people create an  <br/>
unschooling environment that&#39;s very unwelcoming or unaccommodating of  <br/>
others!  There are unschoolers I don&#39;t want to hang out with because  <br/>
the parents don&#39;t seem to have advised their kids at ALL about  <br/>
courtesy to others.  There are unschoolers who have expected (and  <br/>
stated as much) that they want me and my kids to accommodate their  <br/>
children&#39;s behavior.   My kids have been super sweet to autistic  <br/>
strangers and Asperger&#39;s unschoolers who came to our playgroup.  They  <br/>
brought the autistic kid&#39;s mom to tears with their generous  <br/>
behavior.  But they did it because THEY were cool, not because he was  <br/>
being cool.<br/>
<br/>
That phrase comes from a conversation years back with one of my SCA  <br/>
apprentice/protege people (in the SCA some people use one or the  <br/>
other of those terms, depending, but I don&#39;t usually use either, I  <br/>
just say &quot;student,&quot; but that&#39;s a little jarring in the context of an  <br/>
unschooling discussion).  He was feeling pretty smug and self  <br/>
satisfied because someone else who outranked him had been very kind  <br/>
and helpful to him.  I told him it was because the other guy was  <br/>
wonderful, not because he was wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
Too often, I think, people take the social advances of others as  <br/>
proof that they themselves are wonderful, and so they take for  <br/>
granted those beginning friendships and they don&#39;t think to  <br/>
reciprocate, or to do their part to make sure the time together is  <br/>
rich and fun.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But as to being sociable, I strongly believe it&#39;s a natural  <br/>
intelligence.  Of course people can learn courtesies and formulate an  <br/>
internal checklists of ways to remember to try to be, just like those  <br/>
who aren&#39;t natural-born spellers can have their spelling tricks and  <br/>
memory devices.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway...  Gardner&#39;s intelligences, for anyone who&#39;s wondering at  <br/>
this point what I could possibly be thinking.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t have the best social skills.  I have had to stretch myself and<br/>
learn.  I needed to put myself into situations with other people even though<br/>
I might feel a little uncomfortable at first.  I knew that my children<br/>
needed me to help them.   It was something I really had to work at.  It also<br/>
wasn&#39;t as difficult as I thought it would be. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Also, in the back of my mind, I thought my kids would freak if I asked them<br/>
not to do something and I was afraid of that big reaction in front of<br/>
people.  Nope.  Unfounded.  They actually didn&#39;t have any issues when I<br/>
started asking them to be courteous.  I still think about the guitar story<br/>
and how you mentioned you&#39;d be upset if a 3yr old came into your house and<br/>
started strumming roughly on your guitar and the mom did nothing.  My son<br/>
DID that and I remember standing there thinking that I didn&#39;t want to mess<br/>
with his exploration, but, felt bad for my aunt (who owned the guitar) and I<br/>
didn&#39;t know what to do.   Thankfully, I did come to a good answer (sitting<br/>
on the couch, holding the guitar, showing him now to gently strum).   She<br/>
wasn&#39;t happy that he turned the knobs and un-tuned the guitar, though.  So,<br/>
the next time we went and he beelined for the guitar (she had forgotten to<br/>
put it up) I told him that she wasn&#39;t comfortable with him playing that,<br/>
but, that there were lots of other interesting things to play with.  Guess<br/>
what.. He was FINE with that!<br/>

there&#39;s an aura coming from you of not wanting to do the social  <br/>

it. She needs to at least try to like what I&#39;m working so hard to do  <br/>
for her.&quot; And I&#39;m guessing that because I&#39;ve had the same thoughts  <br/>
running through my head as I push my social boundaries. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe instead of the goal being social, focus on the things she  <br/>
enjoys. Even adults who are desperate to make new friends find it  <br/>
difficult until they stop trying to make friends and start focusing  <br/>
on finding activities they enjoy. Probably because they project an  <br/>
aura. When they&#39;re looking for friends they probably feel desperate  <br/>
and it keeps people away. When they&#39;re focused on having fun, they  <br/>
project a more relaxed, fun aura.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is he comfortable staying home by himself?<br/>
<br/>
Someone recently mentioned, maybe on another list, that she has set  <br/>
days for out of the house and set days for in home and makes sure she  <br/>
doesn&#39;t do any errands on home days. If it&#39;s not dependable and seems  <br/>
random when out and home happen, the kids can have totally different  <br/>
perceptions of how much of each is happening. So the stay at home kid  <br/>
will feel like you&#39;re always out and the going out kid will feel like  <br/>
you&#39;re always at home.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How do I find that fine line between respecting my children&#39;s<br/>
&gt; boundaries and helping them step out of their comfort zone?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Whose comfort zone? Your son&#39;s so your daughter can be more social?  <br/>
If he doesn&#39;t want to be more social then you aren&#39;t helping him,  <br/>
you&#39;re pushing him.<br/>
<br/>
Someone also mentioned that they bring lots of solitary stuff for  <br/>
their stay at home kid for him to do while he waits for his sibling <br/>
(s) to be done, make sort of like a nest for him away from home. Make  <br/>
him helping her get out be as easy for him as possible. And make her  <br/>
helping him be at home as easy for her as possible.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I feel<br/>
&gt; like I&#39;m being told to be different than I am because I&#39;m an adult.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, the suggestion is that if you want to hold onto your nonsocial  <br/>
ways you&#39;ll get in the way of helping your daughter be with people  <br/>
more. When there are several goals, eventually one goal will get in  <br/>
the way of another and you have to choose.<br/>
<br/>
Since you chose to have children rather than remain childless, that  <br/>
means you chose all that goes with having children, even being out in  <br/>
society with social kids when you&#39;d rather be home.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It&#39;s not easy for me at all to do things that make me feel<br/>
&gt; uncomfortable. I&#39;ve never been pushed to do uncomfortable things<br/>
&gt; until my adult/parenting years. If my children&#39;s boundaries should<br/>
&gt; be respected, why shouldn&#39;t mine be?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your daughter isn&#39;t disrespecting your boundaries by being social.  <br/>
She has a need that&#39;s not being met. She didn&#39;t choose to be social  <br/>
to irk you. You may not be directly thinking that, but the idea may  <br/>
be half formed in the back of your mind even if you know it&#39;s not true.<br/>
<br/>
Since you&#39;ve had way more years on the planet, since you chose to  <br/>
invite the kids into your lives, it&#39;s part of the whole package deal  <br/>
to find ways to meet your needs without taking from your kids. They  <br/>
didn&#39;t sign up to be supporters of your needs. The glorious thing,  <br/>
though, is that the more we take their needs seriously and work hard  <br/>
at finding ways to meet them, the more they&#39;re willing to accommodate  <br/>
us when they&#39;re able.<br/>

liked it.  Suddenly I realized that I could do that to other people.  I<br/>

karate so much?  And the hip hop class I took with my kids?!  I felt <br/>

adult modern dance class this fall (I fell flat during a turn last <br/>
night, graceful I am not), I have been learning more about sewing <br/>
because my DD needs help and is passionate (and knitting is probably <br/>
next), allowing myself to delve into Japanese anime with my son has <br/>
openned up a whole world of trying to learn Japanese so I can help <br/>
him when he wants to watch the original versions, and I could go on <br/>
and on.  <br/>
<br/>
I would never want my comfort zone to dictate my willingness to <br/>
assist my kids in persuing their passions ... in fact, I would never <br/>
want my comfort zone to dictate my willingness to persue my own <br/>

previous experiences and the stories that you tell yourself about <br/>
those experience.  You always have the choice to revise your <br/>
interpretation of a comfort zone.<br/>

change, so I might like it another day.&quot;  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When Kirby was five and Marty was two or three, we went to a  <br/>
&quot;Homeschooling Science club&quot; meeting at a park near our house.  It  <br/>
had been advertised in the state homeschooling newsletter.  We walked  <br/>
up happy and expectant, and there were maybe eight moms sitting on  <br/>
blankets.  I walked up toward the middle of the group and I  <br/>
introduced myself, and the boys, and one mom said &quot;Do you use  <br/>
Sonlight, or Abeka?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I said &quot;We&#39;re unschoolers.&quot;  The hole they had kind of tentatively  <br/>
made for me to join was almost physically closed up.  They all looked  <br/>
at each other shifty-eyed instead of at me. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But one mom said &quot;The big boys are playing over there, and the little  <br/>
boys are there,&quot; and pointed.  Kirby would&#39;ve gone with &quot;the big  <br/>
boys,&quot; but they wanted to play together.  They wandered around  <br/>
awkwardly, I think, kinda seeing if anything was interesting.  It did  <br/>
NOT seem to be permission for them to choose to play with the big  <br/>
girls or the little girls.<br/>
<br/>
In the playgroup we were used to, the kids ranged from infants to ten  <br/>
year olds, and they all played together, or however they chose to.   <br/>
This was very foreign to all of us.  I did sit with the moms a little  <br/>
bit, but they were uptight and boring and not one of them was getting  <br/>
off the ground to go and interact with kids, though a couple of them  <br/>
did yell across to tell a kid to stop doing something or other.<br/>
<br/>
They were like my mom and her relatives, when I was little, only they  <br/>
weren&#39;t sitting at a table with beer and cigarettes.  But they were  <br/>
not there doing anything like science, and they weren&#39;t there with  <br/>
their children.  They were there with the other moms, and the  <br/>
children were divided into four groups and were in danger of breaking  <br/>
rules and being reprimanded.<br/>
<br/>
I got up and went and talked to Kirby and Marty, and we left when  <br/>
we&#39;d been there long enough that it wouldn&#39;t seem really rude.   <br/>
Nobody invited me back, but that&#39;s okay.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was probably wearing jeans and none of them were, too.  I was  <br/>
probably pregnant with Holly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was dumbfounded just at first, and then realized it had to do with  <br/>
me being a potentially evil influence over their Christian families.   <br/>
They were homeschooling to get their kids away from people like me.<br/>

And you don&#39;t *have to*----you *can* CHOOSE to.<br/>

As *parents*, we put ourselves into all sorts of uncomfortable <br/>

course---there are certainly options. But the love we have for our <br/>
children tends to *enable* us to do so much more for *them* than for <br/>
anyone/thing else in the world.<br/>

worries of others.  Since starting my new job, I&#39;ve become the <br/>
subject of the preschool with my crazy homeschooling lifestyle.  I&#39;ve <br/>
fielded questions that I haven&#39;t had to answer in a long time.  They <br/>
obviously settled in my brain and now I&#39;ve got to shake them loose!<br/>

Jeffrey (12) is loving life these days.  He is happily engrossed in <br/>
his video games on his Playstation 3 system.  One of his favorite <br/>
things to do is find glitches in the games.  He reads about them on a <br/>
game forum and then tries to find them in the game himself.  He gets <br/>
really excited when he finds something on his own.  I remember what <br/>
he was like when he felt stressed and pressured and I know it wasn&#39;t <br/>
good for him at all.<br/>

Holly and Marty have had a lot of fun finding out what the programs  <br/>
would do if they did unpredictable things.  Often the programmers did  <br/>
include a response to an odd action (I&#39;m thinking of Harvest Moon at  <br/>
the moment), and sometimes they find some interesting glitch or  <br/>
outcome.  Holly took a chicken to church in one Harvest Moon game and  <br/>
left it there.  It stayed alive.  It didn&#39;t lay eggs, but it didn&#39;t  <br/>
need to be fed, either.  It showed, still there, moving around like a  <br/>
chicken does, when she&#39;d go to the church.  She watered a chicken  <br/>
with a watering can once, and the chicken became invisible.  It still  <br/>
laid eggs, and it was in her inventory, but it didn&#39;t show.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1122450286">I just reposted an article about socializing that was originally in <br/>
Connections, on my blog at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://familyrun.ning.com/profiles/blog/show?id=2184370%3ABlogPost%3A27214">http://familyrun.ning.com/profiles/blog/show?id=2184370%3ABlogPost%3A27214</a> . <br/>
Here&#39;s a quote:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Recently someone posted on one of the lists about moving outside of her <br/>
comfort zone for the sake of defending her child. I am lucky that it seems <br/>
Jayn rarely needs defending. But I am going to have to step out of my timid <br/>
comfort zone if I am ever to have more friends for myself and offer Jayn a <br/>
wider circle. I am going to have to find a way to get past shyness. I need <br/>
to connect proactively with the other parents I meet at such places as Jayn&#39;s <br/>
new ballet class, and at the future interests that she chooses, so that I <br/>
can facilitate the practical aspects of meeting up with her new friends. One <br/>
adjustment I can make is to lower my expectations from seeking more <br/>
soulmates to seeking pleasant acquaintances, and Trust that the deeper <br/>
desire will be manifested by the Universe.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I wrote that a year ago. She doesn&#39;t go to ballet any more. If anything she <br/>
relies even more strongly on our less than ideal neighbors.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt; If my children&#39;s boundaries should<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; be respected, why shouldn&#39;t mine be?  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wanted to address something inspired by this last sentence above.<br/>
<br/>
Respecting your own children&#39;s boundaries is something that you can control <br/>
by your own actions and make the choice to enact. However holding on to an <br/>
expectation about what other people will do is tying your happiness or <br/>
comfort to the actions of others. This is not something that you can <br/>
control.<br/>
<br/>
Young children, are always going to put their own needs before their <br/>
parents&#39; - even if they are able to perceive them. Empathy comes eventually.<br/>
<br/>
I have noticed how much energy unschooling parents are willing to put into <br/>
their kid&#39;s joy. One thing we do is devise unusual strategies to help us <br/>
through those comfort zone stretch times.<br/>
<br/>
For example with me, just as I used to take a book everywhere when I was a <br/>
child, now I take a bit of crafting along - usually some beading on my <br/>
latest doll, or some plastic bag crochet. This gives other people a <br/>
conversational opening, and it gives me something to focus on instead of my <br/>
own fears and shyness. However unlike a book or magazine, I am still able to <br/>
talk to people at the same time. Plus kids are usually interested too. If <br/>
no-one wants to talk to me, I don&#39;t feel or look anxious about it.<br/>
<br/>
Another is that I make use of technology. Using email to talk about a recent <br/>
problem is much less confronting than face to face sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
As for Jayn&#39;s comfort zone, I don&#39;t ever push her out of it. Her personality <br/>
won&#39;t stand for it. I comfort her with hugs and cuddles. Later I talk to her <br/>
about some place where she is stuck, and suggest alternatives she could be <br/>
doing. She vehemently refuses, and I stop and remind her that it is her <br/>
choice. Then I stay silent for a brief period. She may continue to say &quot;no&quot; <br/>
or be silent herself. Then some undefinable time, usually shortly, <br/>
thereafter she enacts my suggestion. Her bluster and denial are her ways of <br/>
pushing herself through that comfort barrier.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I use bluster and refusal in the same way in my self talk.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-348092099">I made a surprising discovery yesterday, maybe it was purely by accident.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t consciously intend it to do what it did.<br/>
<br/>
I took a bunch of play clothes to share with the other kids.  Showing up at<br/>
play dates without something to do in a new social circle just doesn&#39;t feel<br/>
right to me.  I want to offer or contribute something toward a fun<br/>
atmosphere.<br/>
<br/>
What I saw happen is that Karl who I knew has been feeling awkward with<br/>
other kids (because of a ridiculous mess that happened with some kids not<br/>
too long ago) was able to focus on and talk about the play clothes and he<br/>
worked through a couple of things about them not asking permission to use<br/>
the play clothes, and through that focus, he was able to see that the other<br/>
children there wanted to hang out with him and play together with them..<br/>
that they liked him just fine and wanted to be there.  He soon let go of<br/>
tussling over the play clothes and went off with the other kids to the<br/>
playground area.  The play clothes gave him a bridge for interacting with<br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
Another time, I took some art stuff with us, really for my own benefit, and<br/>
it turned out to be something that Karl was able to do more than me.  And I<br/>
used it too.<br/>
<br/>
I really don&#39;t do small talk that much.  It&#39;s pleasant but I&#39;m not of the<br/>
turn of mind that does much of it.  So it&#39;s imperative for me to have stuff<br/>
to do while I&#39;m there so I can stay long enough to get to know others.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I always recommend this to parents who are coming to park day for the  <br/>
first time or whose kid isn&#39;t finding it easy to make headway  <br/>
integrating into the group of kids at a park day. If they persist, and  <br/>
bring something to attract other kids and give them something over  <br/>
which they can connect, it can really help a lot. Some of them have  <br/>
brought small animals - pet rats, for example. One (who is on this  <br/>
list) brought their little kittens. For younger kids, dress-ups are a  <br/>
GREAT idea. I love it.<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine who used to haul a huge box load of toy weapons to  <br/>
our park days - mostly wooden swords of various kinds, but some guns  <br/>
and knives, too. Her son was about 8 to 10 years old - the other kids  <br/>
would swarm around the box and they&#39;d get all kinds of games started,  <br/>
with all the kids participating. I&#39;m sure some people objected to the  <br/>
weapons, but the kids really loved them.<br/>
