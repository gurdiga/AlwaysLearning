<div id="ygrps-yiv-2111121090">&quot;If due to financial or medical necessity, you became less available<br/>
to your unschooled children, what would you do?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It would depend on a lot of factors. Age, their ability to get access<br/>
to materials and interesting adults/people and other issues.<br/>
<br/>
BUT, I don&#39;t think what you are describing could really be called<br/>
unschooling. Unschooling is having an interested and curious adult<br/>
available to help them get access to materials, places and things.<br/>
Crisis does not equal joyful unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I would definitely try to find a creative way to help my kids<br/>
maintained the lifestyle of their choice, but I would also try to<br/>
analyze if their lifestyle was dragging them down or giving them<br/>
opportunities.<br/>
What do your children want?<br/>
Do you have access to interesting, fun, talented adults that can help<br/>
them with their questions and lives in general?<br/>
Are they getting enough opportunities to receive care, or are they<br/>
being left to themselves?<br/>
I don&#39;t think leaving them to their own devices and having a stressed<br/>
out parent can fairly be called unschooling.<br/>
