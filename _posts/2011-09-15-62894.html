<div id="ygrps-yiv-825076362">I was working on editing this week&#39;s chat, and found a story that people didn&#39;t respond to, but it&#39;s a good one, and important.  This list is a better place for it anyway.  <br/>
<br/>
Jill Parmer: I have a story about another piece of school thought falling off of me.<br/>
 <br/>
Jill Parmer: When Steve and I were getting our outer brick wall redone, we did all the hard demo work. And at one point I was digging dirt away from the foundation, and a strong thought crossed my mind.  That I can do this work even though I didn&#39;t go to school for construction. And it felt so good to be competent, and just keep working bit by bit.<br/>
<br/>
========================<br/>
<br/>
Think of things like that in your own life that weren&#39;t about interactions with your children, but times when something you were doing as an adult strengthened your confidence in natural learning, or shed light on an aspect you hadn&#39;t considered, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
If you share it with the discussion list, that&#39;s even better, but just thinking through your own recent thoughts and actions might help with your deschooling or confidence.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Recently I needed to figure out how much mulch I needed for a flower bed.  Mulch is sold in bags by &#39;cubic feet.&#39;  I had no idea how to figure how many bags I needed.  I&#39;m sure somewhere in public school I learned how to figure cubic feet, but it&#39;s blank now.<br/>
<br/>
I simply got on the computer and searched for &quot;calculate cubic feet.&quot;  A calculator came up, I put in the needed measurements, and voila - I knew exactly how many bags I needed.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for making me think about this!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1536468555">I have a facility for hearing accents, and knowing where a person is from, especially which part of my own state, North Carolina. There is a town not far from here whose residents (to me) have a very distinct way of almost slurring their words. I&#39;ll ask someone, &quot;Oh, are you from Gastonia?&quot; and they&#39;re surprised I know. I can usually tell if someone is Native American by their accent. I usually know if someone is from Maine, because we vacationed there when I was a child, and can usually &quot;hear&quot; the difference between a Maine accent and a New Hampshire or Massachusetts accent.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never studied linguistics, or checked out any books on phonology. It&#39;s from observing, and listening. It&#39;s not something I even consciously did - I did not set out one day, thinking, &quot;Today, I&#39;m going to learn dialects!&quot; Some part of me must have enjoyed that categorization.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also been playing a lot of Solitaire on my phone, the game called &quot;Klondike&quot;, which is the one with seven cards across on which you place descending cards in alternate colors, and you build up the suits in order on 4 separate stacks. I had the thought a few days ago that I could probably tell very early on which games I was going to lose, by paying close attention to the remaining cards in the deck. I wouldn&#39;t need to play for even 1 whole minute, I could determine really quickly if winning was possible. <br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t done that, but just the thought was exciting to me. Normally, I would not have felt &quot;smart&quot; enough to even think about doing that. I did really well in math in school, until it came time for statistics and probability. I still &quot;did well&quot; and made A&#39;s, because I figured out the formulae to get the correct answers, but I never understood what I was doing. When I&#39;ve heard people talk about players in Vegas counting cards, I would think, &quot;Oh, I couldn&#39;t do that - that&#39;s that whole statistics thing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Knowing that, if I wanted to put the time and effort into learning how to parse out the remaining cards, I could, made me feel more capable. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, just this week! This is mostly a &quot;pulling in a big chunk of  <br/>
knowledge&quot; story that added to a natural accumulation of knowledge to  <br/>
do something new.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been admiring some very creative cakes on deviantArt. The ones  <br/>
with the hard shiny coatings in bright colors. They look like  <br/>
Sculpey :-) (Apparently they&#39;ve also been a big deal on cooking shows  <br/>
and a staple of wedding cakes for some time but those aren&#39;t circles I  <br/>
frequent.)<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t even know what they were called but there was a bake sale for  <br/>
the church coming up and I decided I wanted to try making some. And,  <br/>
via the internet, within an hour or so I not only knew what they were  <br/>
called (fondant, it even feels like Sculpey) but through YouTube had  <br/>
gained enough additional skills to add to the years of playing with  <br/>
PlayDoh and Sculpey to actually create some that look pretty  <br/>
decent :-) (I&#39;ll take some pictures.)<br/>
<br/>
The internet helped with the cake part too since though I&#39;ve baked  <br/>
cookies, muffins, pies and bread, I&#39;ve probably made like 3 cakes in  <br/>
my life before this. None of us are big cake fans so it wasn&#39;t a skill  <br/>
I really needed before this. And when I needed it, I went out and got  <br/>
it. ;-)<br/>

<br/>
My different experiences with learning to read in different languages has been something that has given me confidence in natural learning.<br/>
<br/>
I learned to read English in elementary school and I ended having to go to remedial class. I have memories of it being painfully difficult and boring. It only clicked for me when I was 8 years old and I&#39;ve loved reading in English ever since.<br/>
<br/>
When I was 8, I learned how to read Hindi in about 3 weeks. My parents had sent me away to India to live in a boarding school for a few months. I had never been exposed to Hindi before this. The teachers used physical punishment to accelerate learning - making me find sticks that they would use to hit me across the palms of my hand. I lost my ability to read Hindi within a few months of leaving India.<br/>
<br/>
When I was 12, I took French and struggled for the next 6 years. I did okay in the exams, but never learned more than necessary to pass the exams. I took one year of French in University and did not enjoy it, struggling all the time. I got an A in the course, but my knowledge was all smoke and mirrors. Today I would struggle with simple sentences.<br/>
<br/>
When I was 14, I was sitting in prayers in the temple and I didn&#39;t want to be there. I felt I could not leave without my mom&#39;s disapproval, so I decided to decode our Punjabi hymn book as a fun mental challenge. I first taught myself the numbers and letters using the table of contents and once I had figured those out, I matched the words that were being sung to the words in the hymn book. I figured out the vowels and consonants. Within a couple of hours, I had decoded Punjabi and I could read at a beginner&#39;s level. I rarely read any Punjabi now, but if I have a few minutes to review, I can usually make out the text if I had to.<br/>
<br/>
When I was 29, I had to enroll in a Dutch language course for Dutch citizenship. I was interested and I wanted to be there. After about one year of biweekly night classes, I got an A in the reading section of the course for the minimal level I needed. Dutch is the only other language I read in - never for pleasure, only for information.<br/>
