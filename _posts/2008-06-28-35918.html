<div id="ygrps-yiv-1083539749">**But I see the musical side of dancing (and the math side of music).  <br/>
I don&#39;t see the spelling side at all.**<br/>
<br/>
Sarah knows how to spell a bunch of French ballet words now because she <br/>
wanted to look them up in her dance dictionary. (Most of them are words that are <br/>
also useful outside of dance, but still she probably doesn&#39;t know enough to put <br/>
together a coherent sentence that isn&#39;t about dance.)<br/>
<br/>
Everything really does connect to everything else somewhere. :)<br/>

<br/>
But I don&#39;t think the ballet teacher had them dance out the shapes of  <br/>
the words or anything.<br/>
<br/>
That was Sarah&#39;s initiative to learn more, and because it was words  <br/>
she used a dictionary, she didn&#39;t dance her feelings about the  <br/>
difference between French and English spellings (I&#39;m assuming she  <br/>
didn&#39;t).<br/>
