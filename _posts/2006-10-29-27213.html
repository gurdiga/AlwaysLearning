<div id="ygrps-yiv-918287106">Hi all!<br/>
I need some ideas for helping my son with his newly pierced ear. It <br/>
has actually been about 10 weeks, and he is afraid to take out the <br/>
earring. He took it out for the first time after about 5 weeks, it <br/>
hurt getting the earring out, and putting the new one in. So, he is <br/>
associating anything to do with the earring as pain. He has a very <br/>
low threshold for pain. I want so badly to help him, but he doesn&#39;t <br/>
want to try any of my ideas. The last time we tried to take it out <br/>
it hurt. I think the hole was a tiny bit closed up in back, and this <br/>
is what caused the pain. I feel at a loss as to how to help him. <br/>
This is causing him so much stress right now, and I feel helpless! <br/>
We tried numbing it, which seemed to work, but he is still convinced <br/>
that it will hurt.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any ideas? He gets so frustrated that he cries <br/>
cries, and I sit with him trying to comfort him. He ends up saying <br/>
he hates himself and that he is stupid because he has an earring <br/>
that he can&#39;t even take out. <br/>
<br/>
I have seen so many great ideas on this list that I thought I would <br/>
it out here hoping for some suggestions. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>

<br/>
I do too.<br/>
<br/>
Is the earring moving freely in the hole?  Are you using alcohol or  <br/>
hydrogen peroxide or the stuff made just for ears, to clean up any  <br/>
gunk and help it heal?<br/>
<br/>
The real problem I would see is if it&#39;s not moving around.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1387510873">i always left my earings in my ears for a LONG time after they were pierced. <br/>
  I would turn them alot and clean them with alcohol.  is it infected or <br/>
does he just want to switch ear rings and is afraid it will hurt?  if not <br/>
infected i would just leave it there.  it takes some people along time to <br/>
stay open.  i have very sensitive ears to different metals so have to be <br/>
very careful but when i first had them pierced i would leave the same earing <br/>
for months and just play with it.  you dont have to take them out.  if the <br/>
other earring he tried had a bigger in diameter base thingy it would hurt.  <br/>
i used to leave a little hoop in one of mine and when i would try to wear <br/>
any other earring it hurt cause it was bigger.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1216912163">In addition to the stuff they gave us, we frequently put Solarcain on  <br/>
my daughters&#39; pierced ears - it is antiseptic, but also has something  <br/>
that numbs, too. Usually it is used for sunburn.<br/>
<br/>
And, my girls didn&#39;t take their earrings out for at least 3 months -  <br/>
the people doing the piercing told them to wait that long - Roxana  <br/>
waited more like 6 months to take them out, the first time - didn&#39;t  <br/>
want to risk it being painful. She fooled with them quite a bit -  <br/>
turned them at least a few times per day. It won&#39;t hurt them at all  <br/>
to keep putting solarcain (or something similar) on them. Solarcain  <br/>
is a spray, but we didn&#39;t spray it directly on the ear - just on her  <br/>
fingers and then she sort of dabbed it on.<br/>

Maybe play around and experiment with things you have around the  <br/>
house or can buy that have pain-killing ability.  You might have  <br/>
stuff for teething or toothache or antibiotic with painkiller in it,  <br/>
or Solarcaine as someone recommended.   If he puts that stuff on him  <br/>
and feels that he&#39;s numb in the place, it might give him confidence  <br/>
to use that for the next earring change.<br/>
<br/>
When you switch, try to use an earring with a very straight post or  <br/>
section.  Putting a curve through when someone&#39;s lacking confidence  <br/>
can be more difficult.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1687353410">I would leave it alone. Is there a reason he wants to take it out? I guess <br/>
so or you wouldn&#39;t be asking. :) I would guess from reading that he doesn&#39;t <br/>
have an infection or anything.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter had a hard time after I pierced her ears. I pierced all three of <br/>
my daughters the same evening, the oldest and the youngest did fine, but my <br/>
middle daughter had an infection and it took longer to heal. When we tried <br/>
to change hers it hurt, I just told her to forget about them for a while. <br/>
About two months later she came down stairs with a new pair of butterflies <br/>
in her ear. She just needed to get to the point that she was sick of waiting <br/>
and then did it on her own.<br/>
<br/>
I know for my daughter she was just anxious to change the earrings for <br/>
another pair. But I just said it wasn&#39;t worth all the stress and encouraged <br/>
her to wait a while and then tried not to bring it up.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that helps some. This is often the solution for a stress causer in <br/>
our house. We just deal with it another time if they aren&#39;t ready.<br/>
<br/>
My kids watched me take stitches out of my husband one time and have since <br/>
each taken out their own stitches, but they wait about a week longer than <br/>
the doc says. They all had some minor injury that required stitches within <br/>
an 18 month time frame. So that helped because they had each other to watch. <br/>
But that extra week to get pasted the tenderness made all the difference.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1249612765">THings we&#39;ve learned from multiple exerpiences with piercings:<br/>
<br/>
Do NOT use alcohol or hydrogen peroxide!! Ever. Seriously.<br/>
It kills healthy tissue as well as germs and causes a much longer<br/>
healing time. NOt good.<br/>
<br/>
Leave the stud in for FAR longer than what they tell you. MONTHS. They<br/>
do NOT heal in 6 weeks. Ever. Don&#39;t take the earrings out, don&#39;t put<br/>
in dangly types,just leave the stud alone and clean it once a day<br/>
(since you&#39;re already at 10weeks). <br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t have the actual earring cleanser from the store, Bactine<br/>
is a close second (and numbs a bit). Try to leave the earrings<br/>
alone...they don&#39;t need to be messed with much at all. Taking them out<br/>
to clean it could be causing the pain. My kids (and myself) need to<br/>
leave them alone for several months before switching them out or we<br/>
experience pain.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1425883050">We live by many piercing studios here in San Francisco, and what Emily<br/>
says is very true.  When my daughter got her ear (yes ear<br/>
singular...she wouldn&#39;t let them to the second!) pierced they said to<br/>
put nothing but sea salt on it (1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon per cup of warm<br/>
water) and soak the piercing once or twice daily in the saline.  No<br/>
changing earrings, no taking it out, for four to six<br/>
months. NO neosporin, alcohol, peroxide.<br/>
<br/>
Also, no turning the earring during the healing process!  If anything<br/>
has crusted on the earring, it scrapes the unhealed tissue inside the<br/>
ear and creates more scarring.<br/>
<br/>
If it hurts, it is because it is not ready to be bothered!  The skin<br/>
heals from the outside in, and it takes 4-6 months for the inner<br/>
layers to be completely healed.<br/>
<br/>
I learned so much in the process of researching real piercing vs. mall<br/>
guns.  I have such respect for true piercing artists after our experience!<br/>

close to a city that would have a reputable piercing place?  By that I<br/>
mean not one of those mall places that use a gun, but a place that<br/>
respects piercings as art.  Perhaps it would help him to go talk to<br/>
one of theses people who have devoted their lives to this art form. <br/>
He could see his own discomfort and pain in relation to the greater<br/>
concept of self experession and body adornment.  Sometimes we get so<br/>
focused on something, such as our own pain, that we forget to look at<br/>
the greater picture.  Maybe seeing other people with many piercings<br/>
(and loving it) would give him a sense that he can handle just the<br/>
one.  If anything, it would be an interesting outing, maybe to an area<br/>
of town you&#39;ve never been.<br/>

&gt; Oh, and just because it looks okay, doen&#39;t mean it is pain free.  My<br/>

Bactine, alchohol and such.  A natural solution of sea salt and<br/>
filtered water does an amazing job of healing.  Ask your piercing<br/>
proffesssional (again, not one sitting in a mall kiosk) for suggestions.<br/>

&gt; Hi Sandra,<br/>
&gt; It does move freely. We aren&#39;t using anything to clean it right now <br/>
&gt; because it has been 10 weeks, and it looks fine. He is really scared <br/>
&gt; about the pain. It seems to come out fine, but then when I go to put <br/>
&gt; it back it it hurts just in the back. But, it looks better than it did <br/>
&gt; 3 weeks ago, which is the last time we tried. I think it looks healed <br/>
&gt; and that it would be ok, but he is afraid that there might be pain. <br/>
&gt; So, I am trying to help him with facing the pain, if there is any. I <br/>
&gt; just don&#39;t know how to help him because I don&#39;t want him to feel like <br/>
&gt; I &quot;talked him into it&quot;. He is convinced it will hurt, so I am just not <br/>
&gt; sure how to help him. He is so very frustrated with hiimself because <br/>
&gt; he is afraid to try. I try to help him with his feelings, but that <br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t change anything for him, he still wants to change the earring, <br/>
&gt; but won&#39;t let himself try again. I feel his frustration, and I want to <br/>
&gt; help, but I don&#39;t think there is an easy solution.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thank you!<br/>
&gt; Amie<br/>
