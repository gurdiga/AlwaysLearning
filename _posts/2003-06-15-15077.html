<div id="ygrps-yiv-1111434934">I tend to think an unschooling Utopia would have to be in an intentional community, but short of that, we&#39;ve got it pretty good here in Pensacola.<br/>
You wouldn&#39;t be improving the humidity level in your life at ALL though!! :)<br/>
We have a thriving unschool/inclusive support group that could sure use more people to get this town opened up the way I envision it will be one day! Pensacola is a city of dichotomies....a very conservative region on the one hand, but a strong gay population and other &quot;alternative&quot; types here. There is a large Unitarian church, full of very open minded-liberal types. We have a great health food co-op that offers all sorts of classes and workshops and a fabulous art community for a town this size (about 60,000 in the city limits). The beaches are gorgeous and there is plenty of recreation.<br/>
<br/>
So anyhoo....that&#39;s my plug for Pensacola.<br/>
<br/>
Ren, always trying to get more unschoolers down here!!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-731512011">Hi Ren.  I suppose the perfect place would have to be an intentional<br/>
community.  Ahhh, another place at the beach!  I&#39;ve never visited Florida,<br/>
guess maybe it&#39;s time to check it out...hubby doesn&#39;t want to move there, I<br/>
don&#39;t know why, guess I&#39;ll have to ask...hmmm.  Sounds pretty neat the way<br/>
you describe it. <br/>
