&lt;&lt; We have three TVs. None are on now. Duncan and a friend are out bouncing <br/>
on  <br/>
the trampoline. I&#39;m on the computer (and getting ready to garden). Ben&#39;s at  <br/>
work. And Cameron is out to lunch with his girlfriend, plans to work for my  <br/>
parents, and speak to a man about a job.  &gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
We have five.  Marty was just watching a review of the new Star Wars DVDs and <br/>
asking me questions, and I told him a couple of things I had heard.  <br/>
<br/>
Before I came down here, I was sorting through a shelf of music because the <br/>
shelf collapsed, and we have people coming over to sing tonight.  One thing on <br/>
the shelf below that (which I&#39;ve commandeered for the music) is two <br/>
string-tied bundles of old New Mexicco Magazines.  One right on the top says &quot;Special <br/>
Train Issue.&quot;  I&#39;ve never opened the bundles; a much older friend (now deceased) <br/>
gave them to me years ago.<br/>
<br/>
Holly is in the kitchen playing with some orange/green/weird <br/>
alien-creature-making pop-together things.  I don&#39;t know the name of them.  We gathered them <br/>
all up from Marty&#39;s closet when he cleaned it out recently.  The hadn&#39;t been <br/>
out to be played with for a few years, and now they are.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby has gone to the shop where he works to get a schedule and to talk about <br/>
a murder game he&#39;s about to run.  He ran one without the book, and now got <br/>
the book.  Last night I found him sheet protectors for all the pages, he went to <br/>
Kinko&#39;s where a friend works and got the spine cut off of it, and put all the <br/>
pages in the sheet protectors, in a binder I had.<br/>
<br/>
Last night Marty and Holly were watching some borrowed &quot;Buffy the Vampire <br/>
Slayer&quot; episodes.<br/>
<br/>
Last night Keith (my husband) watched Man on Fire in the bedroom.   It needs <br/>
to go back to the video store soon.<br/>
<br/>
In the time I wrote this, Family Feud has started. Marty&#39;s watching it while <br/>
eating his breakfast.<br/>
<br/>
Thursday Marty and I had a reservation for a tour of a civil war battlefield <br/>
(Glorieta) that&#39;s only shown by riding in the govt. van with a park ranger, <br/>
but Marty got a job and it starts Thursday.  He&#39;ll be making boots and pouches <br/>
eventually, but at first just helping clean up, organize, and cut leather I <br/>
think.   The place of work is the garage at our old house!  That will be <br/>
interesting. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s what Marty will be doing.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s where Kirby works:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://aigamestore.com/">http://aigamestore.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
So TV isn&#39;t keeping them from doing other things.<br/>
Personally,  I think having the choice is a primary consideration.<br/>
<br/>
Marty&#39;s through eating and is playing with a toy gun while he watches TV, and <br/>
talking to me about the gamestore having their website open on a computer in <br/>
the store.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby just pulled up.  He&#39;s going to help me organize the library, which has <br/>
a lot of his gaming stuff in there these days.   That&#39;s where we&#39;re singing <br/>
tonight.<br/>
<br/>
In a couple of hours, he goes to the dojo to teach a class, to take his <br/>
class, and then a weapons session.<br/>
<br/>
What started as a typical moment turned into a day in the life. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Before I hit &quot;send&quot; and got up, the TV was off and Marty was gone.<br/>
He must have ADD.  He can&#39;t even watch half of &quot;Family Feud.&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Report of the moment:  <br/>
Five tvs, five people in the house (Joey&#39;s over), no TVs turned on.<br/>
