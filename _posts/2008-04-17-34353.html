<div id="ygrps-yiv-1126169802">OK I know I said I was going no-mail - and I am - but I found an interesting blog. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.spring.org.uk/">http://www.spring.org.uk/</a><br/>
<br/>
I was enjoying reading some of the linked articles. One idea that startled me was in the &quot;Money and Self Control&quot; article - that our supply of &quot;self control&quot; dwindles the more we use it, until it can be refilled somehow. That struck me as being a useful concept. I think of kids being in a state of self control (eg at school, out of the house, visiting cranky grandma) finding it increasingly difficult to maintain the control and needing the recharge time. <br/>
<br/>
In any case, I know that psychology is an interest of people here, and thought some folks may enjoy some of the articles, or arguing with some of them. There seem to be a reasonable number of footnotes and citations, as well as links to studies.<br/>
