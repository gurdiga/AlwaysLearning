<div id="ygrps-yiv-1416456417">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;And new to unschooling, maybe.  I think several of<br/>
the people on the list are <br/>
new to unschooling.  I don&#39;t want to try to say &quot;only<br/>
people who&#39;ve unschooled for a year or more...&quot; or<br/>
&quot;only those with kids over the age of <br/>
five should post,&quot; but those with less experience<br/>
should probably do more <br/>
reading and less writing at first, at least.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking about this post and it&#39;s been<br/>
bothering me.<br/>
Was this list set up for all unschoolers or just<br/>
long-timers. <br/>
If newbies didn&#39;t post and just read how would<br/>
newbie&#39;s questions get answered? What if a newbie had<br/>
a burning question that maybe old news to long-timers?<br/>
Should they just keep quiet and hope that the subject<br/>
comes up?<br/>
I understand that you posted this in response to<br/>
someone defending their stance on TV limiting (which<br/>
IMO isn&#39;t pure, true, radical - or whatever you want<br/>
to call it - unschooling) and maybe you didn&#39;t mean it<br/>
as a general comment. But I do think that if a<br/>
not-so-confident newbie read it, they may not feel<br/>
comfortable asking a question or stating an opinion. <br/>
I feel that would be a shame for this list and could<br/>
possibly make it a bit stagnant, with only the<br/>
&#39;experienced&#39; unschoolers choosing the subjects<br/>
discussed. <br/>
I would think and hope that *most* newbies would be<br/>
interested in hearing all viewpoints and in that<br/>
hearing, maybe some previously held beliefs may be<br/>
challenged. There are probably other newbies that have<br/>
been following this thread and learning a lot from it<br/>
(and possibly changing some previously held<br/>
perceptions about TV and limit setting in general).<br/>
And this subject may have never come up if a newbie<br/>
hadn&#39;t posted about it.<br/>
I, personally, haven&#39;t been tracking all of it because<br/>
I&#39;ve been busy and the sheer volume has been<br/>
overwhelming for me right now (I&#39;m still days behind!)<br/>
- so I&#39;ve chosen not to get involved in the &#39;TV&#39;<br/>
debate this time around. <br/>
I am grateful for all the insight and awareness of the<br/>
more experienced unschoolers on this list have to<br/>
offer, but does that mean that the rest of us have<br/>
nothing meaningful to offer or contribute? We&#39;ve been<br/>
&#39;officially&#39; unschooling for 3 and a half years and<br/>
&#39;unofficially&#39; for 7 and a half years. I still<br/>
consider myself to be a newbie, probably always will<br/>
be &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
