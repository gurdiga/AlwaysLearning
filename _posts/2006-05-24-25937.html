<div id="ygrps-yiv-990868711">I would love some advice on how to handle this subject.  It seems <br/>
there is a general knowledge that those people who go to college and <br/>
get a degree will make more money and be happier in their lives.  I <br/>
need a new perspective on this.  Here&#39;s an example.<br/>
<br/>
My dd just turned 14 and in our state of GA, she now has the right <br/>
to choose which parent to live with.  I&#39;ve hired an attorney because <br/>
my dd wants to live with me.  Her dad is absolutely livid.  He <br/>
doesn&#39;t like the way we parent and he has plans for Claire and is <br/>
afraid I&#39;m going to ruin her life.  He&#39;s picked the high school for <br/>
her, and then chose all her classes, electives and even after-school <br/>
activities.  My poor daughter is absolutely miserable there and <br/>
wants to freedom to fly!  She&#39;s very brainwashed into thinking that <br/>
public school is the only way into college, and that college is the <br/>
only way into happiness.  If you ask her what she wants more than <br/>
anything else though, it&#39;s to work with horses.  So she&#39;s planned to <br/>
go to college to be a Vet.  Now, in my unschooling lifestyle, I say <br/>
she should not go to school, but instead find her a stable nearby <br/>
that offers lessons and volunteer/job opportunities.  She&#39;d be in <br/>
heaven!  But it all boils down to what about her future?  As a Vet, <br/>
she can make $$$$ dollars.  As a stable worker, she might only make <br/>
$ dollars.  Either way she&#39;d be happy *later*, but what about <br/>
*now*?  Her dad has told her that my ideas will ruin her life.  So <br/>
she wants to live with me but attend our local high school.  I told <br/>
her I was totally supportive of anything SHE wants to do, not her <br/>
dad&#39;s wishes, but hers.  <br/>
<br/>
And of course there&#39;s my ds9 and dd8 to consider.  I have no problem <br/>
if they choose to not go to college, but how do I handle questions <br/>
from well-meaning friends and relatives when they ask things <br/>
like, &#39;How will they afford a car and insurance, a house and <br/>
insurance, all the expenses of life, a family?&#39;<br/>
<br/>
FWIW, I didn&#39;t finish college but I did marry someone who has 2 <br/>
degrees.  He makes a really nice salary so my family thinks I&#39;m okay <br/>
because even though I can&#39;t take care of myself, I married someone <br/>
who can.  It&#39;s really a rather annoying situation, like I earned a <br/>
M.R.S. degree (Mrs. somebody).<br/>
<br/>

choices.  That&#39;s not valid.<br/>
<br/>
Working with horses now might make her &quot;a stable worker&quot; at fifteen,  <br/>
but she can&#39;t be a vet at fifteen.<br/>
<br/>
Be realistic with your daughter.  If you don&#39;t think you can get full  <br/>
custody in light of her dad&#39;s objections, it will be deeply dishonest  <br/>
to let her think it&#39;s a possibility.  You&#39;ll be setting her up for  <br/>
unhappiness.  Even if you were to get custody it could come with the  <br/>
stipulation that she has to attend school.<br/>
<br/>
These things might have helpful ideas in them:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-96201061">I did finish college, but chose not to work so I could be home with  <br/>
the kids. Are we suffering? LOL! People should live within their  <br/>
means. Whether is $x or $xxxx that they are making. Oddly enough,  <br/>
everyone I know lives right up to the edge of their means (or just  <br/>
beyond ;-)  ), including my friend who is a doctor and her husband  <br/>
the software designer. They have more moola than I can conceive, yet  <br/>
they have no more cash than we do.<br/>
<br/>
Everything in life is negotiable. People think I&#39;m kidding, but I&#39;m  <br/>
not. Going out on a limb (although I&#39;ve been backed by writers and  <br/>
grownups who do social studies for a living), our society has  <br/>
squashed the innovative gene. People in India, China, Africa live in  <br/>
abject poverty (ok, not all of them, that was a sweeping  <br/>
generalization, huh?) but they have houses (such as they are)....they  <br/>
create jobs for themselves selling flowers, or food, or embroidery,  <br/>
whatever their talent may lie in. Kids here are taught to live the  <br/>
status quo &#39;go to school, go to college, get a job somewhere  <br/>
established, get married, have 2.2 kids, buy two cars, get the  <br/>
biggest house you can afford, carry on til you die, maybe vacation  <br/>
somewhere beachy and hot every two years&#39;. Why is that the status  <br/>
quo? Why do we mock those who choose to break it?<br/>
<br/>
Example: My friend Natalie. Her husband and she agreed that they  <br/>
would pay for college as they can afford it, ie, they do not get  <br/>
student loans. Hard enough as it is, but they also have six kids. He  <br/>
works a full time job. She homeschools the kids. From what we&#39;ve  <br/>
taught, this would be impossible. But they manage it in a symphony of  <br/>
grace and beauty that brings tears to my eyes. They have CHOSEN to  <br/>
live in university apartments in what some may consider poverty  <br/>
conditions. It&#39;s a little apartment. They have one van for the lot of  <br/>
them. They CHOOSE to not have car loans. They CHOOSE not to have  <br/>
insurance, and pay everything in cash as illnesses pop up (and they  <br/>
have had more than their fair share). They have CHOSEN to spend $x a  <br/>
month to purchase land in Colorado. They CHOOSE not to buy as many  <br/>
clothes, but do CHOOSE to buy sturdy brands that may cost a little  <br/>
more. They go on vacations, although they CHOOSE vacations that are  <br/>
less expensive and more family related. They CHOOSE not to buy all  <br/>
the little things that our society says we should have, fancy  <br/>
clothes, new cars, fast food,<br/>
<br/>
Life isn&#39;t that expensive, what is expensive is living up to  <br/>
society&#39;s expectations.<br/>

Because school is considered standard and &quot;normal,&quot; and your  <br/>
daughter&#39;s not 18, it&#39;s still probably a good idea to take it easy  <br/>
and not thumb your nose too hard.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-193628731">Beth -- there are LOTS of unschooled kids who are in college or  <br/>
graduated and are very successful - so you could gather that kind of  <br/>
evidence in order to at least help her and her father understand that  <br/>
unschooling and college are NOT mutually exclusive.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of trying to convince them that not going to college is okay,  <br/>
maybe just make sure they understand that unschooling doesn&#39;t  <br/>
eliminate that option and, in fact, MANY unschoolers go to college  <br/>
and are extremely successful there - mostly because they&#39;ve survived  <br/>
their childhood with their love of learning intact. They so obviously  <br/>
go to college with some very clear advantages over conventionally- <br/>
schooled peers -- maybe that is something you can talk about? I&#39;ve  <br/>
been trying to find any articles written about this - but no luck, so  <br/>
far. Guess this is something those of us with experience need to  <br/>
write about a little more.<br/>
<br/>
Also - I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve thought of this, but she&#39;s only 14 and it is  <br/>
FAR too soon to nail down a future career. Lots of girls are nuts  <br/>
about horses at 14 -- my youngest daughter was absolutely crazy about  <br/>
horses - rode daily, spent many many hours at the stables, and lived  <br/>
and breathed horses, for years. That time was incredibly valuable,  <br/>
but she&#39;s moved on to some other interests and now thinks she might  <br/>
be interested in being a librarian or maybe an engineer.<br/>
<br/>
It is also a cruel set-up to aim so directly at veterinary school,  <br/>
which IS very hard to get into.  If anything less than a veterinary  <br/>
degree is going to feel like failure, that&#39;s really a lot of pressure  <br/>
and a cruel set-up to impose on a 14 yo.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1480934239">Thanks Sandra.  Just to mention, I am not pushing home education on <br/>
my daughter, only seeking an alternative view point to the attitudes <br/>
that her dad and stepmom, both public school teachers, have been <br/>
putting in her head that you can&#39;t succeed in life without a public <br/>
or private school education.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also not lifting her hopes with unrealistic expectations.  We&#39;re <br/>
following the law to make a change which is our legal right, so we <br/>
have hope.  I won&#39;t squash that.  Her dad has been manipulative, <br/>
flat out lying to her about what the laws in Georgia are because his <br/>
idea is that no kids should ever have a choice on where to live or <br/>
where to school.  <br/>
<br/>
We (my daughter and I) have an appointment with my local school <br/>
district next week to register her for high school.  I&#39;m not <br/>
advocating that she move in with me and quit school all at the same <br/>
time.  I think that&#39;s going to be way too much on her.  However, I <br/>
can put a positive light on home education.  She can still take <br/>
lessons and volunteer at a stable nearby even if she is in high <br/>
school.  Plus, the local high school has an Equestrian Team which <br/>
she thinks is very cool.  Unfortunately, they don&#39;t have an <br/>
orchestra but the band director said she could have an Independent <br/>
Study period worked into her schedule for Viola practice.  We&#39;ve <br/>
been in contact with the school following the advice of our <br/>
attorney.  He&#39;s been practicing family law in this state for a while <br/>
and feels very positive based on his experience.<br/>
<br/>
All I really want is for Claire to be happy.  She wants the freedom <br/>
to choose her own class schedule and activities.  I&#39;m here to <br/>
support her in that.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-121918348">Just my two cents:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not college educated, but my wife has been in school post high school for a full ten years now, from one field to another. This entire time, I&#39;ve earned a living, first for myself, then supporting her, then a car payment, then our daughter, then a mortgage. My parents are both english professors, my sister was a double major in college and is heading back for a master&#39;s. I went to an alternative high school which was akin to a &quot;freeschool&quot; and have never had problems finding work. I&#39;ve been published by a major publisher and am very successful and well-known in my niche. In another two years, my wife will be done with school and I&#39;ll be unschooling dd. I&#39;m looking forward to the reversal of roles.<br/>
<br/>
I did have pretty understanding parents though. They were never critical of my &quot;lazy&quot; high school, nor of my decision to, at first, put off college, then not have a plan to ever go. They saw that I was passionate about things and I&#39;m sure that marrying an academic person helped a bit.<br/>
<br/>
By now she must understand that if she ever wants to have certain careers (doctor, engineer, upper management, teaching), she&#39;ll be best served by having a college degree. Sure, you can always find a way to have a certain career without one, but it can be a small price to pay for certain paths. I do not agree that having a college degree greatly determines everyone&#39;s financial success and freedom.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was thinking about this discussion this morning, while driving over  <br/>
to undo a temporary job I had working for a lawyer with an MBA.<br/>
<br/>
I have an English degree and have dropped out of grad school three  <br/>
times.   The woman I was working for for a while had an English  <br/>
degree, a law degree and an MBA.<br/>
<br/>
Her house is nicer, and she owns two newish cars all by herself.<br/>
My house is bigger, but not &quot;nice,&quot; and I drive a ten year old paint- <br/>
peeling used Dodge Caravan.<br/>
<br/>
My house is very happy,  I have Keith and the kids.<br/>
Her house is very quiet, usually.  She was divorced years ago from a  <br/>
doctor and never had children.<br/>
<br/>
We seem not to be as much in debt.<br/>
<br/>
But when I was letting those ideas float through my head,  I wondered  <br/>
about statistics on college.  First, I bet they&#39;re unattainable.  But  <br/>
what we are shown as examples seem all from the &quot;success&quot; end of  <br/>
things—people point at HAPPY (married with children, financially  <br/>
stable) &quot;professionals&quot; whose degrees enabled them to work in  <br/>
whatever field it is.<br/>
<br/>
But one could point at lottery winners and casino jackpot winners and  <br/>
say &quot;See?  If these people hadn&#39;t gambled, they wouldn&#39;t be  <br/>
millionaires.&quot;  And if  no one said &quot;But what about all the LOSERS?,&quot;  <br/>
it might seem to make sense, for a moment.<br/>
<br/>
Someone with a better head for numbers might describe this better,  <br/>
but what I was clumsily picturing in my mind as the chart of  <br/>
statistics I WISH we had would involve:<br/>
<br/>
What percentage of degreed potential professionals (PhD or  Master&#39;s  <br/>
or Law or Medicine, dentists, veterinarians—whatever it might be) are  <br/>
NOT working in that field?<br/>
Of those who are working, how many wish they weren&#39;t?  (Some number,  <br/>
like the person I was going to talk to today, seem to wish they were  <br/>
in another field, but it&#39;s hard to quit once there are debts, and  <br/>
she&#39;s still making student loan payments after many years, too.)<br/>
<br/>
Of those who entered graduate school, how many wandered off without  <br/>
finishing?  How many of those still have student loans?<br/>
Of those who begin college as freshmen or dabblers, how many do NOT  <br/>
get an undergrad degree?  (I know some didn&#39;t intend to, but were  <br/>
just taking music classes or golf or a theatre class, or just  <br/>
checking it out or using it as a springboard to get the heck away  <br/>
from home.)<br/>
<br/>
But if that could all be amassed in some visual form that I could  <br/>
understand (i.e. not lists of figures), which I don&#39;t think it ever  <br/>
really could, would it start to look like gambling stats, with LOTS  <br/>
and lots of losers, a few low-level winners, and very few REAL  <br/>
&quot;winners&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
If fifty percent of the people who went to college with the intent to  <br/>
get a higher degree finished, THEN would college be a great promise  <br/>
of success?  Would fifty percent failure rate make it a good bet?<br/>
<br/>
I doubt it&#39;s fifty, though.  I would guess two or three percent, or  <br/>
less.  Anyone know if it&#39;s knowable?<br/>

them to be doctors, lawyers, and veterinarians.  A somewhat younger  <br/>
friend of mine, 40ish, just got a master&#39;s degree in chemical  <br/>
engineering.  She works at Sandia labs, and they reportedly/reputedly  <br/>
expect all employees to have or be working on a master&#39;s or higher.    <br/>
People with degrees later in life... do they keep stats on that?  Are  <br/>
the stats by university, or by state?  Is it worse in the U.S. than  <br/>
other places?<br/>
<br/>
-=-Of those students who start as freshmen at 4-year colleges and<br/>

<br/>
At which point is the 60 percent called?  Four years?  Another friend  <br/>
whose youngest is late teens recently finished an undergrad degree  <br/>
she started in the late 70&#39;s. &lt;g&gt;  She&#39;s starting a master&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m partly wondering, on a more emotional than statistical  <br/>
level (lots of both) whether pressure to go to college doesn&#39;t create  <br/>
as many (or more) failures as successes (success in this statement  <br/>
being measured as finishing a degree)?   I know regular school  <br/>
creates LOTS of failures.  Any curve-grading, formal or not, creates  <br/>
failures and below averages.<br/>

<br/>
   &quot;Turning 40 once meant winding down, but for thousands of Canadian  <br/>

    it means winding up: hefting barbells, hitting the books, embracing<br/>

<br/>
The word of the day was &quot;heft,&quot; which is interesting because I had  <br/>
been thinking of the concept of &quot;hefting&quot; something, to test its  <br/>
weight, and wondering whether younger people still knew that term.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of weeks ago a friend of Kirby&#39;s was over who hadn&#39;t seen  <br/>
the new iMacs (I have a G5 I got last summer) and I told him to lift  <br/>
it to see how heavy it was.   So then a couple of days ago I was  <br/>
thinking (don&#39;t know why) of whether that was &quot;heft,&quot; but I&#39;ve always  <br/>
thought of &quot;heft&quot; as holding it with palms of hands and trying to  <br/>
gauge the weight (or just be impressed by the weight).   And lifting  <br/>
the iMac was KIND of like that.<br/>
<br/>
So idle speculation was followed by an appearance of a&quot;heft&quot; in word  <br/>
a day<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-770065835">This reminds me of when I first began iexploring unschooling.  My dh and a <br/>
friend were chatting with me about it...things were getting a bit heated.  <br/>
Me (no college degree but 6 years off and on enrollment for various <br/>
interests) on one side and my dh and friend (both with undergrads) on the <br/>
other.  And one made the comment &quot;when you get your degree you&#39;ll appreciate <br/>
it more.&quot;  To which my reaction was the most enjoyable laugh I&#39;d had in <br/>
awhile.<br/>
<br/>
My dh runs our small marina 3 days/week 1/2 the year and is a musician with <br/>
his double major in Psych and Philo.  The friend works for an airline, at <br/>
the desk and has for 12 years with her Poly-Sci and Foreign Language degree. <br/>
  At the time I was making more than the two of them combined and in my <br/>
mid-twenties with 6 years less under my belt.  Even in retrospect it&#39;s <br/>
hilarious.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, of the people I know and spend time with 60% have degrees (either <br/>
grad or undergrad) from respectable institutions, only ONE is employed in <br/>
their field of interest, she&#39;s an epidemiologist.  Of the five (including <br/>
me) without degrees of any type one is an animator/indie film maker, one is <br/>
a cinematographer, one is about to purchase the bar/venue she&#39;s run for the <br/>
past 8 years, one is a musician (touring with Conor Oberst _Bright Eyes_ as <br/>
I write this), and then there&#39;s me, too scattered to have a particular <br/>
career to persue, but sweetly set up developing marketing materials from <br/>
home for a great company with a great boss.<br/>
<br/>
With all that said, I guess you can&#39;t prove anything about unschooling, but <br/>
it sure makes a good case against the traditional route.<br/>

&gt;Subject: Re: The dumb college argument<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was thinking about this discussion this morning, while driving over<br/>
&gt;to undo a temporary job I had working for a lawyer with an MBA.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have an English degree and have dropped out of grad school three<br/>
&gt;times.   The woman I was working for for a while had an English<br/>
&gt;degree, a law degree and an MBA.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Her house is nicer, and she owns two newish cars all by herself.<br/>
&gt;My house is bigger, but not &quot;nice,&quot; and I drive a ten year old paint-<br/>
&gt;peeling used Dodge Caravan.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My house is very happy,  I have Keith and the kids.<br/>
&gt;Her house is very quiet, usually.  She was divorced years ago from a<br/>
&gt;doctor and never had children.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We seem not to be as much in debt.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But when I was letting those ideas float through my head,  I wondered<br/>
&gt;about statistics on college.  First, I bet they&#39;re unattainable.  But<br/>
&gt;what we are shown as examples seem all from the &quot;success&quot; end of<br/>
&gt;things�people point at HAPPY (married with children, financially<br/>
&gt;stable) &quot;professionals&quot; whose degrees enabled them to work in<br/>
&gt;whatever field it is.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But one could point at lottery winners and casino jackpot winners and<br/>
&gt;say &quot;See?  If these people hadn&#39;t gambled, they wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
&gt;millionaires.&quot;  And if  no one said &quot;But what about all the LOSERS?,&quot;<br/>
&gt;it might seem to make sense, for a moment.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Someone with a better head for numbers might describe this better,<br/>
&gt;but what I was clumsily picturing in my mind as the chart of<br/>
&gt;statistics I WISH we had would involve:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What percentage of degreed potential professionals (PhD or  Master&#39;s<br/>
&gt;or Law or Medicine, dentists, veterinarians�whatever it might be) are<br/>
&gt;NOT working in that field?<br/>
&gt;Of those who are working, how many wish they weren&#39;t?  (Some number,<br/>
&gt;like the person I was going to talk to today, seem to wish they were<br/>
&gt;in another field, but it&#39;s hard to quit once there are debts, and<br/>
&gt;she&#39;s still making student loan payments after many years, too.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Of those who entered graduate school, how many wandered off without<br/>
&gt;finishing?  How many of those still have student loans?<br/>
&gt;Of those who begin college as freshmen or dabblers, how many do NOT<br/>
&gt;get an undergrad degree?  (I know some didn&#39;t intend to, but were<br/>
&gt;just taking music classes or golf or a theatre class, or just<br/>
&gt;checking it out or using it as a springboard to get the heck away<br/>
&gt;from home.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But if that could all be amassed in some visual form that I could<br/>
&gt;understand (i.e. not lists of figures), which I don&#39;t think it ever<br/>
&gt;really could, would it start to look like gambling stats, with LOTS<br/>
&gt;and lots of losers, a few low-level winners, and very few REAL<br/>
&gt;&quot;winners&quot;?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If fifty percent of the people who went to college with the intent to<br/>
&gt;get a higher degree finished, THEN would college be a great promise<br/>
&gt;of success?  Would fifty percent failure rate make it a good bet?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I doubt it&#39;s fifty, though.  I would guess two or three percent, or<br/>
&gt;less.  Anyone know if it&#39;s knowable?<br/>

&gt;Subject: Re: June Unschooling Conference<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hi again,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;*&quot;I doubt that on Waldorf and Montessori lists you called it an unschooling<br/>
&gt;conference.&quot;*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Right.  I don&#39;t call it an unschooling conference on those lists.  I focus<br/>
&gt;on AWSNA&#39;s sponsorship when mentioning it to Waldorf folks and The<br/>
&gt;Montessori Foundation and Int&#39;l Mont. Council&#39;s when mentioning it to<br/>
&gt;Montessori folks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;*&quot;Calling it an alternative education conference would&#39;ve been fine.<br/>
&gt;*<br/>
&gt;I hear you.  I think after hearing your concerns, I would refer to it in<br/>
&gt;different terms on this list next time (although I won&#39;t be sending out<br/>
&gt;another thing about it until about this time next year for the 4th annual<br/>
&gt;conf!<br/>
&gt;***<br/>
&gt;&quot;I&#39;ve been to unschooling conferences. &lt;g&gt;  They&#39;re not about creating<br/>
&gt;schools.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;* Creating schools and learning centers/communities is only an element of<br/>
&gt;our conference, not the focus.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;*&quot;I know unschooling&#39;s a broad concept, and that there IS an unschooling<br/>
&gt;thread through the conference topics, but my objection was that it seemed <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;be being billed as &quot;an unschooling conference&quot; for the purpose of this<br/>
&gt;unschooling list.&quot;<br/>
&gt;*<br/>
&gt;You&#39;re right.  I did put the subject as &quot;June Unschooling Conference&quot; for<br/>
&gt;the purpose of hoping to raise an extra eyebrow.  And I put it out in a<br/>
&gt;different way to each list I post it too.  However, I wouldn&#39;t claim it to<br/>
&gt;be a Montessori conference or Waldorf conference.  Unschooling,<br/>
&gt;Homeschooling, and Democratic Education were the only ones that I felt<br/>
&gt;applied out of all the alternatives.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;*&quot;It was a minor objection, honestly.  A clarification.  I have nothing<br/>
&gt;whatsoever against school reform and alternative education. It&#39;s not just<br/>
&gt;the same, though, as the unschooling families do at home with their own<br/>
&gt;kids.&quot;<br/>
&gt;*<br/>
&gt;Certainly after hearing your concerns, I am more than happy to refer to it<br/>
&gt;in a different way as my goal was not to be misleading.  However your<br/>
&gt;comment about unschooling not being the same struck a cord with me.  While<br/>
&gt;unschooling is certainly not the same as school reform, it is a very real<br/>
&gt;and valued form alternative education.  Alternative education encompasses<br/>
&gt;alternatives (see the cover of our packet for a visual example of this:<br/>
&gt;www.edrev.org/packet.html ).  I also think it&#39;s worth making connections as<br/>
&gt;unschoolers to the freedom-based democratic schools.  The similarities in<br/>
&gt;not only philosophy, but daily approach to education is indecipherable most<br/>
&gt;of the time.  That&#39;s not to say there aren&#39;t differences, as that line of<br/>
&gt;thinking would be naive, but countless commonalities are worth paying<br/>
&gt;attention to and learning from each other.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Best,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
