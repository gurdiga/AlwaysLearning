<div id="ygrps-yiv-2092603574">Joy Erin sent me this yesterday. I mentioned it at Sandra&#39;s chat yesterday and others wanted to see it. So here is the article from the WoW Insider: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.wowinsider.com/2009/04/21/15-minutes-of-fame-dislocated-but-not-disconnected/#continued">http://www.wowinsider.com/2009/04/21/15-minutes-of-fame-dislocated-but-not-disconnected/#continued</a> (WoW Insider is the same e-zine that interviewed Jill Parmer about the Horde of Unschoolers <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.wowinsider.com/2008/01/15/15-minutes-of-fame-horde-of-unschoolers/)">http://www.wowinsider.com/2008/01/15/15-minutes-of-fame-horde-of-unschoolers/)</a>. I think the of the interview with Lileya that I really enjoyed was her description of how her husband had set up the game for her to play, had really made it easy for her to share with him this thing he so enjoys. It was a very sweet and loving gift. <br/>
