Adam and I went to a concert in London for children under five.  It  <br/>
was very interactive with the presenter asking questions as they  <br/>
introduced the different instruments. Adam was really engaged with it  <br/>
and was answering lots of the questions identifying the  <br/>
instruments.When he identified the piccolo the lady presenting it said  <br/>
how did he know what a piccolo was and he said “I watched the  <br/>
Tweenies. And they are very interested in music and they talked about  <br/>
the woodwind section in the orchestra.  So I’ve seen a piccolo  <br/>
before.&quot;   It was really funny because a lot of the people who were  <br/>
there don’t let their kids watch TV and kind of look down on the  <br/>
Tweenies.<br/>
<br/>

Adam is a cool four-year-old I got to meet and stay with in Ashford,  <br/>
west of London a couple of months ago.  He&#39;s fun and funny and very  <br/>
verbal.<br/>
<br/>
The story was told in the chat yesterday and I&#39;m going to find  <br/>
someplace on the TV pages to keep it, but I figured I should share it  <br/>
here first.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2144402186">I tried to send this to the list early this morning.  It might have  <br/>
made my other posts make more sense.   Or not...<br/>
Turns out I sent it to myself!<br/>
===============================<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s latest &quot;tweet&quot;:<br/>
<br/>
Mythbusters- it&#39;s like ZOOM for grownups!<br/>
<br/>
In school one of the &quot;skills&quot; of logic and writing is &quot;comparison and  <br/>
contrast&quot;--the analysis of how two things are the same and different.   <br/>
No doubt Holly could go into some pretty perceptive detail about how  <br/>
Mythbusters and ZOOM are similar, and sing the ZOOM song, and show you  <br/>
some things she learned watching ZOOM when she was growing up.<br/>
<br/>
With apologies if this doesn&#39;t work all over the world, but it&#39;s on  <br/>
the PBS tv site:<br/>

<br/>
and here&#39;s what &quot;Mythbusters&quot; is:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MythBusters">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MythBusters</a><br/>
<br/>
In the U.K. there&#39;s a fun discussion/humor show called &quot;QI&quot; (for  <br/>
&quot;Quite Interesting&quot;) on which they just discuss myths and  <br/>
misconceptions and fallacies, in humorous ways, in a kind-of gameshow  <br/>
format.   Some of that can be seen on YouTube.<br/>

Educational TV, sometimes with songs, explosions and comedians!  Cooool.<br/>
