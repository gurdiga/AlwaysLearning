<div id="ygrps-yiv-236514263">Hello,    <br/>
    I have two daughters who are very new to homeschooling. To be honest I love the idea of the unschooling way, however I do plan to have other resources available for their use. My concern  is how do I address the concerns of the public eye. For example, my daughters have counselors one of them has been asking what work have we gotten done regarding education, etc. I have expressed my beliefs on natural learning, etc however it only seems to catch his eye of concern. I suppose I am not very good at getting my point acrossed or explaining what things my girls are doing that are beneficial to their learning.  Now as I have stated I do plan to use other resources such as the Internet ( www.time4learning.com), but honestly money is tight and have not had that option as of yet. Anyways I was hoping someone would be able to weed through all my gibberish, and have some advice. Thanks in advance! <br/>

<br/>
Other resources than everything in the whole wide world?<br/>
Or do  you mean more schoolish resources than the average of the  <br/>
whole wide world?<br/>

-=-For example, my daughters have counselors-=-<br/>
<br/>
Do they have court-appointed counselors you couldn&#39;t change?  Do they  <br/>
have counselors for some reason that keeps you from changing counselors?<br/>
<br/>
-=-I have expressed my beliefs on natural learning, etc however it  <br/>

<br/>
Your belief on natural learning seems not to be very well thought  <br/>
out, so I&#39;m not surprised if you&#39;re not coming off as confident and  <br/>
persuasive.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Now as I have stated I do plan to use other resources such as the  <br/>
Internet ( www.time4learning.com), but honestly money is tight and  <br/>
have not had that option as of yet. -=-<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have the internet?  Or time4learning costs money?<br/>
You should read lots about unschooling before you explain to us how  <br/>
you intend to do it differently than we do.<br/>
If you read it and decide you don&#39;t intend to really unschool, that&#39;s  <br/>
fine for you, but not fine for this list.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Anyways I was hoping someone would be able to weed through all my  <br/>
gibberish, and have some advice-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really okay not to post anything until you&#39;re clear on what your  <br/>
questions are and it&#39;s not gibberish.  There&#39;s tons of reading here:<br/>
