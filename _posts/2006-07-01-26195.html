<br/>

<br/>
Kareem Elnahal learned a lesson Tuesday night - even in graduation, the<br/>
school still rules.<br/>
The class valedictorian surprised administrators and his fellow 2006<br/>
graduates at Mainland Regional High School when he opted to give an<br/>
unapproved speech criticizing the school. Mainland, Elnahal said, does <br/>
not<br/>
encourage intellectual thought and the exchange of ideas.<br/>
The senior, in a detailed speech that referenced philosphers and ethics<br/>
principles, referred to his education as &quot;entirely hollow.&quot; The speech <br/>
was<br/>
interrupted by the principal, and Elnahal cut his remarks short and <br/>
left the<br/>
ceremony.<br/>
Mainland principal Robert Blake said the speech insulted Elnahal&#39;s<br/>
classmates.<br/>
&quot;That was so hypocritical of him to make that statement,&quot; Blake said. <br/>
&quot;It<br/>
was an insult to everyone here at this school ... he made inflammatory<br/>
comments about the school in general.&quot;<br/>
Reached at his home Wednesday, Elnahal said he regrets the way the <br/>
situation<br/>
unfolded. He was embarassed and apologetic.<br/>
&quot;I put the principal in a very uncomfortable position - he&#39;s a very nice<br/>
guy, actually - I feel bad,&quot; Elnahal said. &quot;I feel bad that he had to <br/>
deal<br/>
with this.&quot;<br/>
&quot;I just wanted to finish up, I felt pretty guilty,&quot; he said. &quot;I felt<br/>
embarassed that the ceremony had to happen this way. It&#39;s supposed to <br/>
be a<br/>
day of celebration.&quot;<br/>
At the same time, Elnahal said he is glad he had the opportunity to <br/>
make his<br/>
point.<br/>
&quot;I went to two parties last night, and I&#39;m their hero now,&quot; he said.<br/>
&quot;I felt like this was the right thing to do,&quot; Elnahal said. &quot;I couldn&#39;t <br/>
show<br/>
the speech (to officials) beforehand because they would have rejected <br/>
it. I<br/>
could tell by the reaction from students that they felt the same way. I <br/>
had<br/>
to express it or I felt that nothing would change.&quot;<br/>
In Elnahal&#39;s original approved speech, he was to touch on the high and <br/>
low<br/>
points of school and the experiences that moved the class to maturity. <br/>
But<br/>
once he took the podium, Elnahal changed gears and began to speak about <br/>
the<br/>
shortcomings of the American education system - specifically, at <br/>
Mainland, a<br/>
school that prides itself as being one of the premier area high <br/>
schools.<br/>
&quot;In my reflection ... and I have reflected on this a great deal, I found<br/>
that many of life&#39;s important questions are ignored here,&quot; Elnahal said,<br/>
according to a copy of the alternate speech he provided to The Press.<br/>
He went on to say, &quot;I speak today not to rant, complain or cause <br/>
trouble ...<br/>
rather, I was moved by the countless hours wasted in those halls.&quot;<br/>
Blake said he and other administrators realized after a few moments that<br/>
Elnahal&#39;s speech was different than what was approved. Blake said he<br/>
approached Elnahal, let him know he was disappointed with what he was<br/>
saying, and asked him to wrap up his speech.<br/>
Elnahal described the incident the same way.<br/>
After he finished the speech, Elnahal walked off the stage and left the<br/>
school grounds by his own choice.<br/>
&quot;I thought it would be better for the ceremony to go on without me,&quot; he<br/>
said.<br/>
Blake noted that the very education system Elnahal criticized helped <br/>
him get<br/>
into Princeton University.<br/>
&quot;He conveyed that he felt his education was worthless,&quot; Blake said. &quot;We <br/>
have<br/>
an outstanding education system here.&quot;<br/>
Blake said the audience had a mixed reaction to Elnahal&#39;s comments. Some<br/>
yelled comments regarding freedom of speech after the speech was<br/>
interrupted. Blake said he heard some students cheering and applauding<br/>
Elnahal&#39;s comments.<br/>
&quot;I truly don&#39;t believe they understood what he was saying,&quot; Blake said. <br/>
&quot;My<br/>
hope was they did not hear or understand what he was saying. Whether it <br/>
was<br/>
intentional or not, he was belittling the diplomas of every one of those<br/>
kids.&quot;<br/>
Blake said that as with every valedictorian&#39;s speech, there is a <br/>
process of<br/>
review to make sure the speech is appropriate. Elnahal&#39;s original <br/>
speech was<br/>
approved.<br/>
&quot;This is a school (sanctioned) program,&quot; Blake said. &quot;We give them <br/>
latitude.<br/>
However, to say inflammatory things - no, I won&#39;t allow that. We have<br/>
several thousand people in the stands.&quot;<br/>
&quot;He has a right to his comments, but he shouldn&#39;t have been using that<br/>
pulpit to put forth his limited viewpoint,&quot; Blake said. &quot;Hopefully <br/>
people<br/>
kept it in context.&quot;<br/>
David Hudson, a research attorney at First Amendment Center, said it is<br/>
difficult to say in a situation like this who is right and who is wrong.<br/>
&quot;The question becomes whether (the student&#39;s) speech is student <br/>
initiated or<br/>
school sponsored,&quot; Hudson said. &quot;It&#39;s a hazy issue.&quot;<br/>
Hudson noted that students do not have full First Ammendment <br/>
protection, and<br/>
do not have the right to say whatever they want at a school event.<br/>
But at the same time, disliking a student&#39;s speech is not a reason to <br/>
stop<br/>
it, Hudson said. If there was substantial concern that the student&#39;s <br/>
words<br/>
could cause a problem, then someone has a right to step in, Hudson said.<br/>
Blake said that Elnahal&#39;s diploma still is at Mainland. He has not yet<br/>
contacted the school about obtaining it.<br/>
&quot;I guess I have to go pick it up,&quot; Elnahal said.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Press of Atlantic City chose to run the young man&#39;s speech <br/>
following the<br/>
above article:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ELNAHAL&#39;S SPEECH<br/>
<br/>
Four years ago, we gathered here for an education. Today marks a <br/>
milestone<br/>
in that pursuit, a culmination of four years of learning, growth and <br/>
shared<br/>
memories. At such times, it is appropriate to reflect on years past, to<br/>
examine what we have done and what we have learned. Today I am charged <br/>
with<br/>
that difficult task, and I would like to thank the school for the<br/>
opportunity to stand before my peers and reflect on our time together.<br/>
<br/>
Education can be defined a number of different ways. For me, it is the<br/>
product of human curiosity. Intellectual thought, as far as I can tell, <br/>
is<br/>
nothing but the asking and answering of questions. In my reflection,<br/>
however, and I have reflected on this a great deal, I found that many of<br/>
life&#39;s most important questions are ignored here. What is the right way <br/>
to<br/>
live? What is the ideal society? What principles should guide my <br/>
behavior?<br/>
What is success, what is failure? Is there a creator, and if so, should <br/>
we<br/>
look to it for guidance? These are often dismissed as questions of <br/>
religion,<br/>
but religion is not something opposed to rationality, it simply seeks to<br/>
answer such questions through faith. The separation of church and state <br/>
is,<br/>
of course, important, but it should never be a reason for intellectual<br/>
submission or suppression of any kind. Ethics - it is what defines us - <br/>
as<br/>
individuals, as a society - and yet it is never discussed, never <br/>
explained,<br/>
never justified. Rousseau, Descartes, Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Aquinas,<br/>
nearly every major writer I&#39;ve encountered devotes time to the subject. <br/>
And<br/>
it&#39;s not as if these questions are without practical concern, that they <br/>
are<br/>
less immediately relevant than science for instance. Our laws, our<br/>
institutions and all our actions are a reflection of our ethics. Our own<br/>
society owes itself to the writers of the enlightenment, but we never <br/>
probe<br/>
their work - we fail to espouse the movement&#39;s central principle, doubt <br/>
-<br/>
doubt everything. We study what is, never why, never what should be. For<br/>
that reason, the education we have received here is not only <br/>
incomplete, it<br/>
is entirely hollow.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s more, this same lack of focus can be found in many of the <br/>
subjects we<br/>
do study. We approach history as though it were a story, endlessly<br/>
cataloging every major character or event. But the details of that <br/>
story are<br/>
insignificant - what is significant is the progression of ideas. A <br/>
study of<br/>
history should get some sense of how the society he sees around him<br/>
developed from those built thousands of years ago, what ideas changed <br/>
and<br/>
what changed them. When humanist scholars looked into ancient Rome <br/>
during<br/>
the Renaissance, they searched for moral examples, for ideas. They <br/>
didn&#39;t<br/>
mull on every single daily event. They were inspired, and they <br/>
transformed<br/>
society. History is not an end in itself; it should act as a tool for<br/>
greater thought.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s not only history. I&#39;ve taken a literature class nearly every <br/>
year<br/>
of my life, but never has a question so basic as &quot;What is good writing?&quot;<br/>
come up. Literary technique, what should be the focus of the class, is <br/>
never<br/>
discussed. How does an author develop plot? How can an author control <br/>
mood<br/>
or tone in his writing? What is the advantage of one author&#39;s methods <br/>
over<br/>
another&#39;s? Such matters are never discussed. We read for the sake of<br/>
reading, to talk about our interpretations in class as though we were <br/>
in a<br/>
book club. But no attention is paid to why we read the books we do, what<br/>
makes them so special. And this pattern, grade for the sake of a grade, <br/>
work<br/>
for the sake of work, can be found everywhere. Ladies and gentlemen, the<br/>
spirit of intellectual thought is lost. I speak today not to rant, <br/>
complain<br/>
or cause trouble, and certainly not to draw attention to myself. I have<br/>
accomplished nothing and I am nothing. I know that. Rather, I was moved <br/>
by<br/>
the countless hours wasted in those halls. Today, you should focus on <br/>
your<br/>
child or loved one. This is meant to be a day of celebration, and if <br/>
I&#39;ve<br/>
taken away from that, I&#39;m sorry. But I know how highly this community <br/>
values<br/>
learning, and I urge you all to re-evaluate what it means to be <br/>
educated. I<br/>
care deeply about everyone here, and it is only our fulfillment I <br/>
desire. I<br/>
will leave now so that the ceremony can go on. Again, my deepest <br/>
apologies,<br/>
God help me.<br/>

The following article is from today&#39;s Press of Atlantic City&#39;s (New <br/>
Jersey)<br/>
Editorial Section:<br/>
<br/>
MAINLAND&#39;S VALEDICTORIAN<br/>
<br/>
He proved his point<br/>
Published: Friday, June 23, 2006<br/>
Updated: Friday, June 23, 2006<br/>
<br/>
Imagine the nerve ... a high-school valedictorian, on his way to <br/>
Princeton<br/>
next year, daring to speak about a topic he obviously has given much <br/>
thought<br/>
to - the American education system.<br/>
<br/>
It beats the more typical &quot;We are all astronauts on the spaceship to<br/>
tomorrow&quot; speech, if you ask us.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, the unapproved speech that Mainland Regional High School<br/>
valedictorian Kareem Elnahal tried to deliver before he was hustled off <br/>
the<br/>
stage by Principal Robert Blake was rather thoughtful and quite <br/>
interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, schools have a right and a responsibility to screen graduation<br/>
speeches. But Elnahal&#39;s speech wasn&#39;t a puerile rant filled with <br/>
expletives<br/>
- it was an on-the-money critique of the public education system. In <br/>
fact,<br/>
both Mark Twain (&quot;I have never let my schooling interfere with my<br/>
education&quot;) and, slightly more crudely, Paul Simon (&quot;When I look back <br/>
on all<br/>
the crap I learned in high school, it&#39;s a wonder I can think at all&quot;) <br/>
have<br/>
offered similar critiques.<br/>
<br/>
Mainland officials simply proved Elnahal&#39;s point by not letting him give<br/>
this speech. Listen to what he said:<br/>
<br/>
n &quot;Education can be defined a number of different ways. For me, it is <br/>
the<br/>
product of human curiosity. Intellectual thought, as far as I can tell, <br/>
is<br/>
nothing but the asking and answering of questions. In my reflection, <br/>
however<br/>
... I found that many of life&#39;s most important questions are ignored <br/>
here.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
n &quot;We approach history as though it were a story, endlessly cataloging <br/>
every<br/>
major character or event. But the details of the story are <br/>
insignificant -<br/>
what is significant is the progression of ideas.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
n &quot;We read for the sake of reading, to talk about our interpretations in<br/>
class as though we were in a book club. ... And this pattern, grade for <br/>
the<br/>
sake of grade, work for the sake of work, can be found everywhere. <br/>
Ladies<br/>
and gentlemen, the spirit of intellectual thought is lost. I speak <br/>
today not<br/>
to rant, complain or cause trouble. ... Rather, I was moved by the <br/>
countless<br/>
hours wasted in those halls.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And the principal&#39;s reaction? He said Elnahal&#39;s speech was <br/>
&quot;hypocritical&quot;<br/>
and &quot;an insult.&quot; Speaking of the other students in the audience, Blake <br/>
said,<br/>
&quot;My hope was they did not hear or understand what he was saying. ... He <br/>
was<br/>
belittling the diplomas of every one of those kids.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Nonsense. Elnahal was making those kids, and everyone else, think.<br/>
<br/>
School officials should be asking themselves why they wouldn&#39;t have <br/>
approved<br/>
this speech in the first place. Elnahal&#39;s fellow graduates and <br/>
Mainland&#39;s<br/>
teachers and administrators shouldn&#39;t be embarrassed by him. They <br/>
should be<br/>
proud of him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-356379236">Wow.<br/>
It&#39;s a strong story and will probably make differences in people&#39;s  <br/>
thinking, but I&#39;m on the school&#39;s side.<br/>
<br/>
-=-&quot;In my reflection ... and I have reflected on this a great deal, I  <br/>

<br/>
It wasn&#39;t honest, as he knew it was trouble and it WAS complaint.<br/>
<br/>
Bummer.  Had he printed up lots of copies of his alternative speech,  <br/>
he could&#39;ve distributed five to everyone who attended, and they  <br/>
could&#39;ve gone out all over the place.  Freedom of the press is his,  <br/>
if he pays for the paper and printing.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Whether it was intentional or not, he was belittling the diplomas  <br/>
of every one of those<br/>
kids.&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
Valedictorians aren&#39;t the kids who work hard in school.  They&#39;re  <br/>
usually the kids who breeze through, who learned most of that stuff  <br/>
on their own.  The kids who do work hard are those whose family life  <br/>
would conspire against success, but they keep at it anyway.  The kids  <br/>
whose diplomas mean something are those who would&#39;ve gotten D&#39;s and  <br/>
F&#39;s if they slacked off as many of the A students do, but they worked  <br/>
and they got B&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Those are the diplomas he belittled.  But it&#39;s been my experience as  <br/>
a kid and a teacher that the &quot;best students&quot; (as measured by grades,  <br/>
which is the purpose of grades) don&#39;t know much about the middlin&#39;  <br/>
kids, many of whom are actually, truly working to learn or to make  <br/>
better grades.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Hudson noted that students do not have full First Ammendment<br/>
protection, and<br/>
do not have the right to say whatever they want at a school event.-=-<br/>
<br/>
They have protection of what they say outside of school  Nobody has  <br/>
&quot;full protection&quot; when they&#39;re on someone else&#39;s TV show or radio  <br/>
program or podium.  Freedom of expression belongs, at one level, to  <br/>
those providing the platform, and in the case of a school&#39;s  <br/>
graduation ceremony, there is very literally a platform and it very  <br/>
clearly belongs to the school.<br/>
<br/>
-=-School officials should be asking themselves why they wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
approved this speech in the first place.-=-<br/>
<br/>
They weren&#39;t given a chance to approve it or not.  Maybe they would  <br/>
have approved at least big hunks of it.  He knew he was doing  <br/>
something subversive or he wouldn&#39;t have been sneaky.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad it was published and I&#39;m glad he&#39;ll get attention, but it  <br/>
doesn&#39;t seem heroic or mature to me.  (And some of his arguments and  <br/>
critiques seem lame, too.)<br/>

function in which someone owns the platform. The &quot;school&quot; is a public  <br/>
school - and so when the school censors, it is the government doing  <br/>
the censoring. Most of us are protected from censorship by the  <br/>
government - even though we might not be given full freedom of speech  <br/>
on a tv show or radio program or a private platform of some kind, it  <br/>
isn&#39;t the government prohibiting us from saying what we think.<br/>
<br/>
Courts have ruled that the government can censor kids at school -  <br/>
that their right to free speech CAN be abridged by the government  <br/>
operating as a school. Hard to imagine how schools could function  <br/>
without that ruling, but the issue seems complex to me.<br/>
<br/>
The exact same thing happened at MY high school graduation, by the  <br/>
way. The valedictorian chose to speak out against the vietnam war and  <br/>
they turned off his microphone part way into the speech, and escorted  <br/>
him off campus. I was 17 and I thought he was very brave. So - my  <br/>
perspective is colored by that personal experience, I&#39;m sure.<br/>
