<div id="ygrps-yiv-284534706">Thought I&#39;d turn to you guys with a question.<br/>
<br/>
Last night my dd, 8,  was crying to me.  She says whenever she thinks about her wishes (dreams) she gets sad.  She feels as though they are unattainable.<br/>
<br/>
A little history on us,  she went to preschool-1st and had always enjoyed school.   We started homeschooling because my ds, 10, was really unhappy in school.   I asked her if she wanted to be home or at school,  she chose home.  So we&#39;ve been unschooling for 1 year now.<br/>
<br/>
What she was sad about last night was that she wants to do voices for cartoons.    We were watching Rurouni Kenshin, and they had outtakes from when the actors were screwing up.  It was really funny.      <br/>
<br/>
She likes to imitate other characters/actors voices,  with accents and such,  loves doing Hermione&#39;s accent,  Fat Bastard&#39;s from Austin Powers,  you get the picture.    She also thinks she would like to be an actor but thinks she&#39;ll be afraid to go on stage,  so that was depressing her.  She is signed up to be in a play this summer with her little sister so that will be a good experience.   I told her this might be the way to work up to the voice parts in cartoons.<br/>
<br/>
I just don&#39;t know what to tell her,    I feel really helpless.   We live in a smaller town and the plays are the only thing I can think of for her to possibly attain her dream.<br/>
<br/>
She also loves all sorts of art, so we do as much of that as we can.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Do you think I should just let her vent and it should pass.     Anyone have suggestions on the whole voice over stuff?   What else I could suggest for her?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh,  I just thought of what my SIL said one time when she heard that Abbi was sad,  &quot;maybe she should be in school,  she might be too much of an extrovert to be happy at home.&quot;  She&#39;s a teacher!   I don&#39;t agree with this, but I do think its sometimes hard (on an extrovert) when we aren&#39;t in alot of activities (by their choice).  Because then she doesn&#39;t see or interact with alot of people.        What are your thoughts on this?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1324438782">There are probably other and better computer games to do this, but here is one I&#39;m aware of.  We have an American Girl computer game that allows you to create plays using characters and backdrops from the AG stories.  You can have the characters move around, sit, walk, etc.  You can record sound effects and put in your own voice (or voices, in your daughter&#39;s case :-).  Then play them back.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-596644850">Thanks Mary Ellen,  I&#39;ll look into that one and maybe there are other ones<br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
I hadn&#39;t even thought of that!   I&#39;ll pick up a microphone for the computer<br/>
too,  she&#39;d love that.<br/>

knee-high white boots and ask them to dance for the rest of the kids in <br/>
little Go-Go cages while lights whirled around the room?<br/>

What an odd thing... a Go-Go Group!<br/>
