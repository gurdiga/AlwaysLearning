On a different note, has it been decided where the 2005 Live and Learn<br/>

Thanks,<br/>

I hope you&#39;re planning to join us in MA in August. I have NOT made a decision <br/>
about the 2005. I&#39;ll be making a few calls soon though. It&#39;ll be decided <br/>
BEFORE August though!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have decided, after much deliberation, to go to the Texas conference<br/>
instead.  I&#39;m sad to miss Live and Learn this year (having been to the past<br/>
two) but there are so many people I want to hear at the Texas one and still<br/>
not much info on the MA one.  We can only afford to do one.  So, I&#39;m<br/>
looking to next year now to catch up with the Live and Learn gang again. <br/>
If you are planning to do it and I can help, please just ask.  (I&#39;m in<br/>
south Charlotte).  <br/>

Texas conference?!?!?!  Where?  When?<br/>
<br/>
I want to go to an unschooling conference so bad but a trip to Maine just<br/>
isn&#39;t in the cards for us.<br/>

This is the site.  It is in Dallas.  It looks great.  I am really excited<br/>
about hearing Jan Fortune-Wood, who writes often in Life Learning Magazine.<br/>
The others look great too.  Also lots of activities for kids of all ages. <br/>
I have loved the Live and Learn Conferences - seeing Sandra and Anne Ohman<br/>
in person was awesome, so it was a hard decision.  <br/>
