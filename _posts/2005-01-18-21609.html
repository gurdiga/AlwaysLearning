<div id="ygrps-yiv-1232718113">Commentary on a complaint on the side from someone who has  left the list but <br/>
because of the way yahoogroups works is probably still getting  the mail.  <br/>
(It takes a day or so for the requests to leave lists to be  fully processed by <br/>
yahoo&#39;s system, it seems.)<br/>
 <br/>
-=-Stop telling me what I could have done and ask yourself  what you could <br/>
have done.  If I have done anything to offend you then  I apologize.  Have I <br/>
offended you? -=-<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m doing what I&#39;m willing to do and interested in doing,  which is providing <br/>
a discussion for serious unschoolers.  There  is a beginning unschooling list <br/>
(I&#39;m not on it, which should make it &quot;safe,&quot;  right?) called Unschooling <br/>
Basics, and there&#39;s another list for unschoolers  with children younger than <br/>
official &quot;school age&quot; and they&#39;re both linked and  easily joined here:<br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
-=-I have gotten several messages in my inbox from other  people from the <br/>
group who feel that I am doing good but won&#39;t post  that at the group because <br/>
they are afraid of being attacked and  misunderstood. -=-<br/>
 <br/>
No one is ever required to post. <br/>
No one as far as I know  is probited from starting her own yahoolist to <br/>
discuss unschooling  however she wants.  If anyone wants to start a yahoogroups <br/>
list with a  different focus or tone and announce it on this list, that would be  <br/>
fine.<br/>
 <br/>
 -=-It is my understanding that the group was intended to  support <br/>
unschoolers not alienate them.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
The group&#39;s description is below.  When people say  &quot;support group&quot; they seem <br/>
often to mean that others will coo and sympathize and  say &quot;there there&quot; and <br/>
&quot;good mom.&quot;  There are such lists out there.   They don&#39;t specialize in really <br/>
helping people understand any higher ideals,  they specialize in cooing and <br/>
empty sympathy.   When my neopets pet  says &quot;You are the best owner ever!&quot; it <br/>
makes me feel good, but it&#39;s not  real.  All the cyber-pets say that to all the <br/>
cyber-owners.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-A little kindness goes a long way.-=-  <br/>
 <br/>
My focus is unschooling, not individuals who admit they don&#39;t  care about <br/>
unschooling.  There are six billion and some people in the  world.  I don&#39;t care <br/>
as much about the economics of rice farming or the  Antarctic ice shelf or <br/>
what happened to the Wankel engine as I care about  unschooling.  That seems <br/>
entirely normal and reasonable to me.<br/>
 <br/>
If I&#39;m equally &quot;kind&quot; to everyone regardless of whether their  arguments and <br/>
posts support unschooling or not, I&#39;m being kind to no one.   The list won&#39;t <br/>
function.  If the list &quot;supports&quot; things that lead  away from or sabotage <br/>
unschooling, those who really want to move directly toward  better unschooling will <br/>
wander away.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m not an alcoholic, but my mom was and I&#39;ve been to AA  meetings with her.  <br/>
I was never a La Leche League leader, but I attended  meetings for years.<br/>
 <br/>
At AA meetings they don&#39;t &quot;support&quot; people who want to keep  drinking for now <br/>
and maybe stop gradually.<br/>
La Leche League leaders are not obligated or expected to spend  one moment of <br/>
their time advising a mom on how to schedule bottle  feedings.<br/>
I&#39;m volunteering my time and energy, as are the many excellent  regular <br/>
posters whose words are quoted on computers and refrigerator doors all  over the <br/>
world now, and I don&#39;t know about them, but I can&#39;t be expected to go a  long <br/>
way kindly supporting school at home.<br/>

Description <br/>
Category: _Attachment  Parenting_ <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/dir/Family___Home/Parenting/Attachment_Parenting)">http://groups.yahoo.com/dir/Family___Home/Parenting/Attachment_Parenting)</a>        Discussion for homeschooling fans of <br/>
John Holt, whose books  Learning All the Time, Never Too Late, and Teach your <br/>
Own have made  unschooling a sweet and viable option for thousands of families.  <br/>
<br/>
This is a moderated group, with trapdoors for the  uncooperative. (Not <br/>
moderated in the advance-approval way, but in  the be-nice-to-play way.) It&#39;s an <br/>
idea group and is intended to lean  more toward pure unschooling than neutral, <br/>
general homeschooling  discussion--there are hundreds of general homeschooling <br/>
discussions  for newcomers. It&#39;s to focus more toward how people learn no <br/>
matter  where in the world they are, rather than on what&#39;s legal in any  particular <br/>
country or jurisdiction. <br/>
