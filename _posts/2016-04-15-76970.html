<div id="ygrps-yiv-132644160">Robin Bentley brought me a video, by a psychologist from Texas, a TED talk. <br/>
It’s very short, fun and funny.  He talks fast and I like that.<br/>

<br/>
Two of my essays from years back have some of those ideas—joy over “happiness” and the idea of deciding what you’re looking for, so you can learn to see it.<br/>

Anyone who would like to level up should watch that video and read those essays and never go back.<br/>

This particularly resonates in me today ! I am reading a book called <br/>
&quot;The year of happiness&quot; (L&#39;annee du bonheur, by Isabelle Filliozat), <br/>
which gives you a quote and thoughts / meditations / ideas of actions to <br/>
live more consciently, and today was :<br/>
&quot;We should try to be happy, if only to set an example&quot; (&quot;Il faudrait <br/>
essayer d&#39;etre heureux, ne serait-ce que pour donner l&#39;exemple&quot; - <br/>
Jacques Prevert)<br/>
If we are waiting for happiness, we might never see it. Finding <br/>
happiness in the little things, changing the way we think about <br/>
happiness, makes us happy !<br/>

This week’s Just Add Light and Stir posts have started to seem repetitive to me, but the same ideas kept coming up, and the same kinds of photos kept jumping up and say “choose me!”<br/>
<br/>
This one, with a beautiful photo of Megan Valnes’ daughter, <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com/2016/04/up.html">http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com/2016/04/up.html</a><br/>
leads to one from November 2014<br/>

which says<br/>
<br/>
It can be a happy spiral upward, when feeling better about being a good mom makes one a better parent, and the child smiles and laughs, and the mom relaxes more.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Good things build up gradually into great things. Bad things erode faith and trust.<br/>
<br/>
That was pulled from a post I made on someone’s facebook page, when someone I don’t know had bragged that she had told her young son that the ice cream man was dangerous or evil (I don’t remember the wording and it’s probably best not to quote her), and that it had saved her a small fortune.  In suggesting that it had also cost her trust and relationship, I wrote the line above.  And I saved it, which was good, because the person whose page it was on deleted it, and wrote to me.  The mom who told the story DID lose her relationships with her children, who are now grown, and her mental health is not good lately.   I didn’t mind it being pulled.  I was pretty direct, and this wasn’t a mom with young children anymore anyway.  <br/>
<br/>
It was too late for her.<br/>
<br/>
Don’t let it be too late for you, if you’re reading this. <br/>
<br/>
What’s above is just the past two days’ quotes and links. :-)<br/>
<br/>
The past couple of weeks&#39; of Just Add Light posts are:<br/>
<br/>
Up!<br/>
Good to great<br/>
Better everything<br/>
Clutter or beauty?<br/>
Quiet abundance<br/>
Take your time<br/>
Soft<br/>
Normal<br/>
Aware of words<br/>
Stop time<br/>
This planet<br/>
Stop and hush<br/>
Health and contentment<br/>
Sleep when you’re tired<br/>
Empowering Others<br/>
Dark corners, lit up<br/>
Acceptance and relaxation<br/>
<br/>
Those who read those by e-mail should sometimes go to the blog.  The formatting is nice, and each post has “You might also like” and it leads to three somehow-related posts.<br/>
<br/>
One of the links above offered me a post with a photo of my daughter, Holly.  It’s called “See good, be good.”<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com/2014/12/see-good-be-good.html">http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com/2014/12/see-good-be-good.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Without happiness, contentment, peace, joy, unschooling will not flourish.  It might “work.” It might be passable.  Why settle for barely, sort of unschooling enough to… what?  to pass?  to not be criticized?  to not have social services come?<br/>
<br/>
This is something worth doing well, because it has the potential beyond the obvious.  A parent who can really understand these things and do them changes his or her own life as much as the children’s lives are changed.    <br/>
<br/>
It’s a pretty big deal. :-)<br/>
