<div id="ygrps-yiv-57480504">A friend brought a Spam cookbook back from Hawaii a few years back.  Many of <br/>
the recipes were Japanese-style things, where Spam was used in little cubes <br/>
like tofu is.  <br/>
<br/>
Presented as an option to tofu, LOTS of people might like Spam better!<br/>

who likes tofu and Spam both, occasionally<br/>
but who has never been to Hawaii</div>
