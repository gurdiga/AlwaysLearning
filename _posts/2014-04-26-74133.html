<div id="ygrps-yiv-134165563">Thank you so much for sharing this!!! &nbsp;My 15 year old is enrolled in an umbrella school and I send weekly time sheets in detailing what she&#39;s learned. She plays a lot of video games and I have been struggling to come up with which subject to use for which hours so this is a tremendous help!<br><br>~Charlott Nagai~</div>
