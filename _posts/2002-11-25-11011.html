&lt;&lt; I think about this a lot in relationship to my girl scout <br/>
troop.  Statistically one or two of them will be gay.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When Keith and I had two boys and no girl, we used to talk about what if one <br/>
was gay.  Statistically, it could happen.  And by what the Chinese say about <br/>
couples, the two people together will balance out into half (very) female and <br/>
half (very) male.  I&#39;m not very pink.  Keith I met singing and dressing up in <br/>
costumes (albeit tough-guy Viking costumes, but they&#39;re still skirts with <br/>
amber necklaces! &lt;g&gt;), and majoring in theatre.  Now...   <br/>
<br/>
But we looked at the projected statistics about kids their age and we said <br/>
&quot;Here&#39;s the deal; one could be gay, and one could marry an Asian and we have <br/>
to be able to afford to visit the grandkids in Japan, or China, or wherever <br/>
it&#39;s going to be.&quot;  So we just prepared ourselves for those possibilities or <br/>
not-unliklihoods early, instead of spinning comfortable visions of them <br/>
marrying in town and living next door or anything.  <br/>
<br/>
Our next-door neighbor at the time was the pinkest little boy I&#39;ve ever, ever <br/>
met.  He loved coming to our house because he could dress up from our costume <br/>
box, and he loved to put on plays with the other kids, and fashion shows.   <br/>
His mom refused to let him sign up with Kirby for a jazz/tumbling/ballet <br/>
class when they were five.  She said NO BALLET.  He can play soccer if he <br/>
wants to.  <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a great quote.  Good.  I found it current from the time.  Kirby was <br/>
seven, nearly eight:<br/>
<br/>
March 22, 1994<br/>
Two little girls in our neighborhood both have crushes, sort of, on A.J., <br/>
next door, who gives every indication of growing up to be a cross-dressing <br/>
Queen of the Night.  (The other day Kirby was talking about Rachel wanting <br/>
A.J. to be her boyfriend.  I said, &quot;Does A.J. even like girls?&quot; and Kirby <br/>
said.  &quot;Of course.  Why else would he always want to be Kimberly when we play <br/>
Power Rangers?&quot;)<br/>
