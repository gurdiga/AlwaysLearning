<div id="ygrps-yiv-1344505290">There&#39;s something I come across sometimes and couldn&#39;t find this morning.<br/>
<br/>
Joyce explained why &quot;whatever works&quot; isn&#39;t good for unschooling.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s on <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://joyfullyrejoycing.com">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com</a> or <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com">http://sandradodd.com</a> or elsewhere, but I couldn&#39;t find it. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m hoping someone just knows, or can think of a phrase to search it out by.<br/>
<br/>
And when it&#39;s found, new members here can read it. :-)  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-153527000">Sometimes I just can&#39;t find files.  I try phrases and get all kinds of other things.  OH!  Or more likely, I get to reading the wrong leads, and then I find something that needs to be edited on one of my pages, or I find something that would be a good Just Add Light quote, or I see an e-mail I want to answer, or Holly comes to sing &quot;Someone to Watch Over Me&quot; and talk about how dated the song is, socially, and I tell her that in those days lots of people believed that God would provide each person with their perfect mate and we compared that to &quot;I&#39;m Wishing&quot; from Snow White, but Holly says at least Snow White was actually made in the 1930&#39;s, but her girls choir is singing this song in the 21st century, and....<br/>
<br/>
Oh.  That&#39;s all just what happened this morning. :-)<br/>

Connections, but in the opposite way.  Detractions?  Distractions?  <br/>

Was it something you have saved or a post on the list? There&#39;s this:<br/>
<br/>

While I can picture what you&#39;re doing as running smoothly for you and<br/>
working for the goals you&#39;ve created, the problem with &quot;Here&#39;s what<br/>
works for us&quot; type ideas is that it&#39;s like the instructions of a<br/>
recipe but without the ingredients. The instructions are the steps you<br/>
do. The ingredients are your family: the personalities, culture and<br/>
skills you each have.<br/>
<br/>
The instructions create an apple pie you like in your family because<br/>
your personalities, culture and skills are apples, flour, butter and<br/>
sweet spices. If you hand those instructions to someone&#39;s whose family<br/>
is rice, tomatoes and beans it wont &quot;work&quot;, eg, won&#39;t create an apple<br/>
pie.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Work&quot; for this list is defined as nurturing great relationships with<br/>
them (and between them and the world they live in), living and<br/>
learning joyfully. And what the list tries to help people get a grasp<br/>
of is not the instructions for apple pies but the chemistry and<br/>
physics that create the type of synergy this list focuses on, eg,<br/>
radical unschooling (as defined on this list) that &quot;works&quot; (as defined<br/>
previously).<br/>

I used to think of myself as distractable and as a procrastinator, now I<br/>
realize that I am a person who has a wide variety of interests and feels<br/>
free to choose to pursue those interests as she sees fit.  When something<br/>
is critical or time sensitive, I get to business, but if it is one of those<br/>
things that can wait, sometimes it waits.<br/>

Before there was the internet and people used dictionaries and encylopedias, there were many times that I went to find something for me and someone else, or for a group, and didn&#39;t come back as quickly as they had thought I would, because right next to that thing I was looking up were other cool things!!<br/>
<br/>
That problem is all solved, now, with Google.  <br/>

Maybe the disappearing part isn&#39;t solved with Google, but it&#39;s solved with<br/>

I still have a hard time looking one thing up without looking at all the stuff around it.  And to watch *one* video on Youtube?  Not likely. :-)<br/>
