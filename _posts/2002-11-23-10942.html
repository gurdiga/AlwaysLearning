<div id="ygrps-yiv-412704753"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Some day perhaps an innocuous little old lady will<br/>
&gt;take advantage of me.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ha!  That reminds me of a friend of mine who took a<br/>
cruise to Spain.  A little old gypsy woman tried to<br/>
snatch my friend&#39;s elderly mother&#39;s purse by<br/>
pretending to be infirm and begging.  I guess my<br/>
friend is inherently suspicious, because she figured<br/>
out what was going on and grabbed her by the wrist<br/>
before she could make off with it.<br/>
