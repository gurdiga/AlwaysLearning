<div id="ygrps-yiv-659924901">My ds Jack (5) has long hair.  <br/>
  It was something I agreed too because I thought as soon as he started <br/>
  getting called a girl he would quickly have cut.  <br/>
  WRONG!  <br/>
  He just assertively  states his boyness.  <br/>
  No problem.<br/>
  It took me a long time to get comfortable with it.  I feel other <br/>
  peoples confusion or discomfort when they mistake him.  <br/>
  I offered him a hair cut on a weekly basis for quite while.  I&#39;m just <br/>
  now getting to the point that I am really comfortable with it, and <br/>
  actually like it!<br/>

  My 5 almost 6 year old boy, Kevin, is &quot;letting his hair grow&quot; too.  I have always shaved their heads<br/>
  and said when they were old enough to decide, they could have their hair however they<br/>
  wanted.<br/>
<br/>
  It&#39;s taking me a while to get used to too.  I really liked how he looked with &quot;short&quot; hair.  So, he<br/>
  knows that I like it better short, but of course, it is his hair.<br/>
<br/>
  When he was 4, we would shave all sorts of shapes and words into his head.  Most people<br/>
  thought I was crazy! to let him &quot;tell me what to do&quot;.  We just thought it was fun!  We did<br/>
  a dinosaur, a lightning bolt and BUZZ when he was into buzz a lot.<br/>
<br/>
  It&#39;s so nice to see others are going through and &quot;letting&quot; their children be themselves!<br/>
<br/>
  Love,<br/>
