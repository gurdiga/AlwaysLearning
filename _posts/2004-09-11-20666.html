<div id="ygrps-yiv-2024796093">Unschooling  is finally really becoming our way of life. The ggd,s are 9. We have been on this path for a year and a half now. <br/>
 We took them out of a bad situation in K. and tried homeschooling where  some of it was great and where in the end I really blew it and in remorse said they could go back to public school if they wished. Steph  jumped at it and I didnt blame her a bit-I was a real jerk .she really liked most of it  -still fondly remembers  a lot but the bad parts for her really made an impression.She went from late October of that year (grade 2 )  to the  first week in May and spent  lots of time at home  when  she wanted.<br/>
 Kara tried it  in  mid Feb  for part of two weeks. The damage to her self esteem still lingers and colors her  view on formal writing and arithmatic  to this day.<br/>
Kara has been firmly declaring that this  Unschooling is her preference for 6 or 8 months now. she is more sure of it all the time. <br/>
Steph  has had me worrying  for a long time. I always had the feeling that if I actually asked her if this is her preference she would  hesitate  and wonder if public school  might be something she would like to try again. During a casual conversation about her friends going back last week I bit the bullet and  said something like...so what do you think..do you like this unschooling way of living and without hesitation she said yup,  I sure don&#39;t want to go back in school.<br/>
I can&#39;t express my relief. I had been carrying the  dread  around like  a rock  around my neck.<br/>
I woke up constantly at night wondering if  they felt that they really wanted to go back but were worried that I might  think  they  were wrong to want to. <br/>
I had to wait till I  had  come to a place in myself where if they really wanted to go back again  I could  deal with it.<br/>
I spend a lot of late nights  reading  on lists like this , reading and learning-trying and trying harder and  doing well with the girls and failing miserably sometimes.<br/>
It struck me early on-especially reading on &quot;homeschooling&quot; lists that it was more about the Mom, this was her new flavour of the week-getting all excited about this or that new curriculum, unit studies-worksheet site -field trip-what she was going to get the kids to do . and lots of moaning about how  the kids wouldnt co operate and what were other parents doing about  how to make the kids  do the work and  it really started to give me the creeps. Here were these kids who couldn&#39;t get  away from it all now. at least in public school they got to leave and go home. <br/>
Like so many of you have said on this and other unschooling lists-I can&#39;t imagine  doing it any other way. Every day there are new insights.<br/>
well enough, just had to  blither on.<br/>

In the wet  as usual Rockies  of BC. where the girls are still playing  Harvest Moon-or game boys or both and came in for more paper  and questions on how to spell  some more words to name  some animals.<br/>
