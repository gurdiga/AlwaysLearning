Anyway,  Zack asked me to buy a mini-notebook to write down his cheat codes. <br/>
If you  are unfamiliar with them they consist of pressing certain buttons in <br/>
a  <br/>
certain sequence - right, x, triangle, left, up, down, down, etc etc.  There <br/>
are <br/>
usually 7-10 buttons in a sequence. For many of thse cheat  codes, <br/>

===============================<br/>
 <br/>
Once in a while I get an e-mail from some relative of an unschooler who  <br/>
wants to somehow get me to agree that their daughter or sister is not  unschooling <br/>
right, and that they&#39;re ruining their child and they want me to  agree with <br/>
them that they should call the country or some such.  It&#39;s  happened half a <br/>
dozen times over the years, and inevitably I try to explain  unschooling, and the <br/>
other person, figuring out I&#39;m not going to express shock  and try to help <br/>
them, gets crazy-hostile.<br/>
 <br/>
One was in the desperation phase and went off about how her nephew or  <br/>
whatever was playing video games all the time, and when I said there were lots  of <br/>
advantages, she said &quot;NOT IF HE CHEATS.&quot;  She had gotten wind of the  idea of <br/>
&quot;cheat codes&quot; and saw it as cheating, as in cheating to get into West  Point, <br/>
or cheating on a bar exam.  Immoral, preventative of actual  learning, evil <br/>
CHEATING.<br/>
 <br/>
I said they were programming codes to change the game, but she was sure  then <br/>
I was in cahoots to help people be CHEATERS, that cheating was cheating and  <br/>
I was obviously as immoral as her evil unschooling cheating relatives.<br/>
 <br/>
Heck of a rant.<br/>
 <br/>
But it reminded me of &quot;Pigs is Pigs,&quot; a short story from 1906, which is  here:<br/>
