<div id="ygrps-yiv-366796378">This is in response to the note about the laws being<br/>
different in some states where it actually can and<br/>
does happen that a judge can make the kids go to<br/>
school.  That absolutely horrifies me that this can<br/>
and does happen.  Doesn&#39;t anyone understand how<br/>
horrible that can be for children to go from being<br/>
homeschooled and ESPECIALLY unschooled to being thrown<br/>
in school and have their Mom (or whoever that main<br/>
care-giver is who is with them 24/7) be forced to get<br/>
a job outside the home just so the Dad doesn&#39;t have to<br/>
pay so much child support?  My husband told me a few<br/>
times when things were so bad and we talked about<br/>
divorce or when the subject would come up about other<br/>
families that he thinks child support is completely<br/>
unfair and feels strongly that in that situation the<br/>
children should be put back in school and the mother<br/>
go back to work.  This from a man who went with me to<br/>
get certified to homeschool and LOVED it, who wants to<br/>
go again, who tells people who ask when we will put<br/>
our kids in school &quot;Never!&quot;.... until he might be<br/>
forced to pay child support.  Unbelievable....  <br/>
<br/>
Right now my husband stays in Seattle while he works<br/>
at Boeing and comes home on weekends and that works ok<br/>
for us right now and hopefully we&#39;re over our bad<br/>
times and things will work fine even if he gets a job<br/>
over here and lives with us full time.  I have been<br/>
selling things on ebay and make a little bit of extra<br/>
money but have been looking into other ways to make<br/>
money from home so I can be somewhat self supporting<br/>
or hopefully totally self supporting if the day ever<br/>
comes that I need to be.  I will NEVER put my children<br/>
back in school unless that&#39;s what they and I decide we<br/>
want, which will never be.  This coming from a woman<br/>
who raised 2 older children who went all the way<br/>
through school and I never gave a thought to<br/>
homeschooling.  I sure love it now though with my 2<br/>
boys here.  <br/>

<br/>
Well, you know, usually the dads, or at least their lawyers, are smart enough <br/>
not to phrase it as being about child support, really. They ask that the kids <br/>
be sent to school because they&#39;re concerned about them, because they&#39;re not <br/>
getting an education, because they&#39;re socially maladroit, etc. etc. etc. And <br/>
courts buy into it. There are not enough of us that most judges know enough <br/>
homeschooled kids to feel deep down that they know those dads might be wrong. <br/>
Judges try to rule on what&#39;s best for the children, and to most of America, <br/>
it&#39;s unquestionable that it&#39;s best for children to go to school. <br/>
<br/>
And I don&#39;t believe there&#39;s a state in the nation where that couldn&#39;t happen.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1532129689">Sorry, I couldn&#39;t seem to get a copy and paste of the<br/>
note I was trying to, but this was from the woman in<br/>
Florida who wondered what putting the kids back in<br/>
school had to do with child support.  The answer is<br/>
that if the kids are in school then the mother is free<br/>
to go back to work in the courts eyes and the more<br/>
money she makes the less she needs to get from her ex.<br/>
 I don&#39;t know about other states but here in<br/>
Washington the way I understand it is that child<br/>
support gets adjusted when one spouse gets a raise,<br/>
the kids aren&#39;t in daycare anymore, etc.<br/>
<br/>
When I told my husband that I had found out that the<br/>
courts would make him pay alimony for a certain number<br/>
of years based on how many years we&#39;ve been married<br/>
(almost 14 now) on top of child support and that this<br/>
particular lawyer told me that the courts would not<br/>
force me to put the children in school my husband<br/>
backed off.  Since the kids and I have been living 150<br/>
miles away from my husband except on weekends things<br/>
have been obviously better between my husband and I<br/>
although I&#39;ve found it&#39;s very difficult to carry on an<br/>
argument by email (email is our main source of<br/>
communication during the week) so arguments are rare<br/>
and we actually enjoy emailing each other.  The hard<br/>
thing is that my life is like that of a single parent<br/>
during the week, with a 9 month old<br/>
behavior-challenged boxer puppy and my 2 children 24/7<br/>
with no breaks, but most of the time I enjoy it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve definitely tried harder to make our marriage work<br/>
&quot;for the kids sake&quot; but it takes two to make it work<br/>
and I&#39;m working on becoming self-sufficient &quot;just in<br/>
case&quot;.  One thing I learned from that lawyer is that<br/>
divorce is very expensive for both the husband and<br/>
wife and it sure is better to try to work things out<br/>
than go through that.  Hopefully things won&#39;t come to<br/>
that with my husband now.<br/>
