<div id="ygrps-yiv-585229371">My son, who is 10, has been asking for the last year for me to find him an opportunity to learn swordfighting.  We looked into fencing, which was too sport-like and too little like traditional dueling for him.  The weapons weren&#39;t right for him either.  We looked into martial arts that use wooden swords, but that wasn&#39;t what he wanted.  I found the the local SCA does swordfighting,  but you need to be 16 for liability reasons.  We did some research and it also seemed that they do not use real swords.  I talked with him about getting involved with the SCA and apprenticing so he could spar in the future but he&#39;d really like to do it now.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m at a loss here.  He wants to use a real metal sword (with armor, if possible), he wants to be able to fight other people and have it be skill-based (using traditional sword moves and techniques).  It has been really hard to explain to him that there just seem not to be many opportunities for this because of his age and liability, and frankly, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m ready to be a parent of a sword-weilding 10 year old unless he can do it with a skilled mentor in a controlled environment. It&#39;s especially hard because the few other interests he&#39;s asked my help with have been especially hard for me to make happen.  He&#39;d really like to learn hypnotism, but most resources out there tend to be for people or professionals to help themselves or others through behavior modification, or on the other end stuff about stage hypnotism which was more on the trickery side of things.  Neither met his needs and it was all geared toward an adult audience.  I tried to explain that the topic is a hard one because there is no consensus whether or not hypnotism is actually real. <br/>
<br/>
I need some suggestions as to options for him as well as help for myself to get  <br/>
past my issues with the danger aspect in all this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1962388024">Sword fighting is something that seems to be going around groups. <br/>
<br/>
My husband, Jeff, just created a bunch of nerf-type swords for the boys (mostly - some of the girls wanted them too). They were so popular that we are going to put together a short how-to-make them video. If I get it done this weekend I&#39;ll post the link or just email it to you. <br/>
<br/>
The kids have been having one on one fights, group matches all sorts of similar play. It&#39;s neat. Maybe these nerf-type sword fighting with friends might be a good intro. <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1919073187">Boffer swords and easy armor (not metal, but plastic or leather or  <br/>
made of padded material, like moving pads or quilted cloth or  <br/>
something) could be fun.  Not little-kid boffers, but foam on PVC, as  <br/>
long as real swords, but PAD THE END well, really well.<br/>
<br/>
You could search google for &quot;boffer armor&quot; because some SCA areas are  <br/>
requiring kid-armor.<br/>
<br/>
Another idea is to buy a sword for him to have, and find things he  <br/>
could stab at.  Bales of hay.  Cardboard boxes (with other cardboard  <br/>
in them for weight, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
Cutting milk gallons with water in them can be a ton of fun with a  <br/>
real sword (not too sharp; doesn&#39;t need to be sharp to work).  Here  <br/>
are some pictures and videos of people doing that:<br/>

<br/>
Put it on a stump or something that won&#39;t destroy the sword and that  <br/>
the sword won&#39;t destroy.  We&#39;ve used the top of a small step-ladder,  <br/>
too.<br/>

This is *exactly* what Jeff and the kids have been making this past week. Like I said we are working on a tutorial video that we&#39;ll post in a few days so you can see exactly how they are made...and make your own if you like <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-945052157">I wonder if he&#39;d be interested in stage combat - it&#39;s not &quot;real&quot; but the goal is to make it look as real as possible.  Maybe a local theater might offer classes or know of someplace that did.  I&#39;ve seen it offered in theater workshops and also in dance workshops (because the combat is basically choreographed, perhaps, and requires a lot of skill with body awareness, I guess).<br/>

<br/>
My niece and a friend of hers (both unschoolers) started there, in a  <br/>
stage combat group by a fencing teacher.  He went stage combat first,  <br/>
and fencing secondarily.  One of them was an artist and used what she  <br/>
learned to know more about body positions (for one of many things),  <br/>
and the other went on to SCA combat, first rapier and then &quot;heavy  <br/>
weapons&quot; (real armor, rattan swords).<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re both in their mid-20&#39;s now.  For further update, one is an  <br/>
increasingly professional photographer (she&#39;s been to two conferences  <br/>
in the past year) and is making money with that; also still doing  <br/>
graphics with pen/ink/photoshop). The other just got a biology degree,  <br/>
is at the moment in Mongolia on a field-research trip, and plans to  <br/>
become a veterinarian.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-747728520">What is you location?  <br/>
There is a FANTASTIC medeival martial arts studio based in Turlock, California that sounds right up his alley.  <br/>
<br/>
You could research it and contact Sir Gemini to see if he has any ideas or connections in other parts of the country.   My 10 yr old son is involved in this program and it is really amazing,  <br/>
Degrendelus Medieval Martial Arts<br/>
It may be a starting point.</div>
