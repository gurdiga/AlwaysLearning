<div id="ygrps-yiv-573254130">I gets lots of questions from the &quot;outside&quot; as to what grade my kids <br/>
are in.  I generally reply with 2nd grade for Dd(8) and for ds(5) I <br/>
just say pre-K.  Even though he is nearly 6, he is not ready for the <br/>
kindergarten class at church and is much more comfortable in the 4 & <br/>
5 year old class.  Dd should be in the 2nd/3rd grade class at church, <br/>
but she is afraid of that class because the new teachers (parent <br/>
team) are making a big deal about everyone reading aloud Bible <br/>
verses.  Therefore, she goes into the Kindergarten class as <br/>
a &quot;helper&quot;, which was her idea and she absolutely loves.  She loves <br/>
to tell me how she helped the others with their papers.  <br/>
<br/>
It seems like everyone wants to put kids into some kind of category, <br/>
but frankly, the more I learn about unschooling, the more I just want <br/>
to say that they are not in a grade level.  Of course, that freaks a <br/>
lot of people out.<br/>
<br/>
What do the rest of you do about &quot;grade&quot; level?  Dd excels at <br/>
anything pertaining to math, but is not a reader yet.  So what does <br/>
that make her (in the public&#39;s opinion)?  A gifted student with a <br/>
learning disability?  If she were in school, she would probably be in <br/>
special classes for reading, and be working at below her level in <br/>
math just to make things easier for her teacher.  She doesn&#39;t have <br/>
a &quot;grade&quot; level.  She just IS.  <br/>
<br/>
I am absorbing all I can about the unschooling philosophy.  It makes <br/>
so much sense and my children are so much happier and I am so much <br/>
more at peace.  This is the first time, since I began homeschooing, <br/>
that I feel completely at peace about my &quot;method&quot; of homeschooling my <br/>
children.  We are just loving and enjoying life and all it brings.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, my original question:  How do others respond when someone asks <br/>
what grade your child is in?  <br/>
<br/>
P.S.  Dd forgets what level she is supposed to be because it is just <br/>
not something we talk about!  When someone asks her, she sometimes <br/>
looks confused and I jump in and help her out.  Ds doesn&#39;t have a <br/>
clue and doesn&#39;t care!  Just thought that was interesting.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1666722288">Q: &quot;What grade are you in?&quot;<br/>
A: &quot;Not in a grade - I homeschool.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That was the usual and that usually got the questioner to switch gears  <br/>
and start asking about homeschooling, instead.<br/>
<br/>
Very occasionally my kids would say, &quot;Well, if I went to school I&#39;d be  <br/>
in 4th grade.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Rosie usually knew what grade she&#39;d have been in because she was in a  <br/>
lot of activities - Girl Scouts, 4H, and soccer, and grade levels  <br/>
seemed to come up pretty often for her. My other kids - not so much.  <br/>
Even right now, I&#39;m not sure if Rosie would be in 11th or 12th grade  <br/>
this year - I&#39;d have to figure it out. But she&#39;d know, if I asked her.  <br/>
It is SUCH a big deal to the other girls on her soccer team,  <br/>
especially - they&#39;re always identifying each other and other students  <br/>
they know by which grade they&#39;re in.<br/>

He&#39;s right on track for Hayden at 9.5<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I said to the woman at the UU church I visited. She mentally<br/>
calculated a grade, I shrugged. Hayden doesn&#39;t much want to be anywhere they<br/>
enforce a strict age division. His new friends in our new town range from 7<br/>
to 67 - everyone&#39;s welcome on his playground ;)<br/>
<br/>
When Hannah was part of a singing girls choir, Hayden was counting the days<br/>
until we could say he was &quot;at grade level&quot; for the boys choir (it was an<br/>
amazing journey figuring out how old he&#39;d be when, beginning at what age).<br/>
He now has this way to calculate ages to the day with this complex formula<br/>
he carries in his head (which is pretty accurate!) and doesn&#39;t care so much<br/>
about grades nor choir.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s the influence of school in our lives.<br/>
<br/>
When people asked me our our kids &quot;what grade,&quot; we had several  <br/>
answers, depending.<br/>
<br/>
Often a kid would look at me questioningly, and I&#39;d say &quot;He would be  <br/>
in third grade, if he went to school.&quot;  The next time or two he might  <br/>
say &quot;third&quot; until he forgot again or got older.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the answer would be &quot;I&#39;m not in a grade, we&#39;re  <br/>
unschoolers&quot; (the answer in and among other homeschoolers).   Or I&#39;d  <br/>
say &quot;She&#39;s twelve.  If she were in school she&#39;d be in seventh grade&quot;  <br/>
or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;They&#39;re not in a grade.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;They don&#39;t go to school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I would be a sophomore, but i don&#39;t go to school.&quot;<br/>

I can remember hearing or using all of those.<br/>

our <br/>
our <br/>
kids <br/>
&quot;what <br/>

would <br/>
be <br/>
&quot;I&#39;m <br/>
not <br/>
in <br/>
a <br/>
grade, <br/>
we&#39;re  <br/>
unschoolers&quot; <br/>
(the <br/>
answer <br/>
in <br/>
and <br/>
among <br/>
other <br/>
homeschoolers).  <br/>
 <br/>
Or <br/>
I&#39;d  <br/>
say <br/>
&quot;She&#39;s <br/>

she <br/>

But Marty mastered all the drum parts on Rock Band at expert level,  <br/>
and so I was just up there helping him insert credit to buy more songs.<br/>

Oh no.  Poor Simon and Linnaea.<br/>
At least when one of my kids looked like a severely retarded deer in  <br/>
the headlights about &quot;what grade?&quot; I could cover for them.    <br/>
Schuyler, sheesh...   They&#39;ll look to you and you&#39;ll blink slowly  <br/>
too!?  &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

I guess you could say &quot;He&#39;s nine; I&#39;m a foreigner; I&#39;m not sure what  <br/>

this year - I&#39;d have to figure it out. But she&#39;d know, if I asked her.<br/>
It is SUCH a big deal to the other girls on her soccer team,<br/>

they know by which grade they&#39;re in.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Kirby was fifteen and working at a gaming store.  His best friend in  <br/>
those days was 15 or 16 and a sophomore at the high school right near  <br/>
the store.<br/>
<br/>
A student from that same high school wrote a long, two-page article  <br/>
on D&D (I think; some CCG) and he quoted Kirby in there, and when he  <br/>
identified kids, as they do in newspapers, it said &quot;Kirby Dodd, junior.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He  hadn&#39;t asked Kirby or anything, and honestly, Kirby  had NO IDEA  <br/>
what &quot;junior&quot; or &quot;sophomore&quot; meant, but his friend who was  <br/>
legitimately a sophomore nearly popped and died.<br/>

&gt;  I can&#39;t answer it here, in the UK. I don&#39;t know what it means. I&#39;ve looked<br/>
&gt;  on-line but it doesn&#39;t stick. So I haven&#39;t a clue what year Simon or<br/>
&gt;  Linnaea would be in. Just haven&#39;t a clue. It makes it easier to answer, I<br/>
&gt;  suppose. Or maybe more difficult... People don&#39;t really get into it after<br/>
&gt;  they hear my accent, I sound so not from here, although to many Canadian as<br/>
&gt;  opposed to American.<br/>
