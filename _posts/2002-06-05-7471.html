&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just went off nomail for the AlwaysLearning list, and as soon as I posted <br/>
&gt;I got an empty email from someone named Cottonwood Farms <br/>
&gt;&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:_angus@...">_angus@...</a>&gt; that had a weird looking attachment to it. It was <br/>
&gt;pretty aggressive at trying to get the email program to open the attachment. <br/>
&gt;I deleted it, so don&#39;t have any more info. Except that they had the Re: <br/>
&gt;AlwaysLearning Irritated Parent in the subject line.  -=-<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hey, Sandra...a few months ago we had this same problem with a virus <br/>
from the same place, Cottonwood Farms.  I believe that person was made <br/>
aware of the problem, but the virus might have been reactivated somehow.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, fyi.<br/>
