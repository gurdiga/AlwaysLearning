hand shops are great for things like that.  Our nightowls love it.  Also,<br/>
cool baking supplies, knitting needles and yarn, and carving tools with wood<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-691972326">Hi,<br/>
We have a pretty large record collection, and they&#39;re easy to leave in their<br/>
little cupboards.  Recently, I&#39;ve been going through and just looking for<br/>
records that my three year old and I can explore.<br/>
<br/>
We listened to a little Robert Frost, him actually reading his own poetry,<br/>
but he didn&#39;t really like that. He ended up LOVING a &quot;cycle of songs on<br/>
texts by Federico Garcia Lorca,&quot; this avant-garde voice scape with his songs<br/>
sung in spanish.  I read him the poem in English, and he asked to hear it<br/>
again.  He also really loves this record, &quot;Chief Red Thundercloud and Co. A<br/>
Child&#39;s Introduciton to the American Indian.   We had some fun reenacting<br/>
the dances by means of the descriptions of the dances in the narrative.<br/>
<br/>
I was amazed.  That experience sent me rifling through all of our records<br/>
looking for more things.<br/>
<br/>
So, I think strewing music is a great fun thing to do.  Check out random<br/>
CD&#39;s at your library and look for something new, lot of things new, and see<br/>
what you guys might like.<br/>

I think books are the worst thing for strewing.  It&#39;s not that I never  <br/>
bring in a book; I do.  But especially for new unschoolers, if they  <br/>
think learning is in books, if the mom thinks that and passes that on  <br/>
to the kids by leaving books out, they don&#39;t make the giant step away  <br/>
from &quot;book learning&quot; to natural real-world learning.<br/>

I hope there&#39;s very little about books there.<br/>

<br/>
I think having music on without thinking of it as &quot;strewing music&quot; is  <br/>
good, but the three examples seemed more like &quot;educational&quot; records-- <br/>
poetry, narrative.  That&#39;s cool too, but it&#39;s not music just because  <br/>
it was on a record.  Listening to books on tape or to Mp3s of readings  <br/>
of things is similar, nowadays.<br/>
<br/>
Try various kinds of music, though, and just because a kid enjoys some  <br/>
baroque brass ensemble doesn&#39;t mean he loves trumpets or that he loves  <br/>
baroque music; just means he was interested in it that one time.   <br/>
Don&#39;t jump like a gold prospector on anything that looks like a rich  <br/>
vein.  Maybe play some other baroque stuff another day.  Maybe play  <br/>
some other trumpet stuff.  But don&#39;t invest lots of time and money  <br/>
just because a kid smiled and asked a question or two.  Sometimes it  <br/>
will take a year for an interest to take hold.  Sometimes a minute.   <br/>
Sometimes an hour is all the interest a kid has in the history or  <br/>
printing, or in the cupcake revival, and their entire lifetime&#39;s  <br/>
curiosity will have been satisfied about that subject.<br/>
<br/>
Balance and move lightly, around strewing.  Nothing is too little; all  <br/>
is too much.<br/>

Places to go and things to do:<br/>
 <br/>
all kinds of museums,<br/>
farms<br/>
zoos<br/>
orchards<br/>
hiking<br/>
sports<br/>
geocaching<br/>
renaissance festivals<br/>
theme parks<br/>
youtube is a great place to see things about everything, sit with them and watch!<br/>
travel<br/>
watch movies<br/>
play video game WITH them or watch<br/>
board games for the family is so much fun!<br/>
card games<br/>
laser tag<br/>
places like house of bounce (inflatables)<br/>
obstacle courses ( you can create one on the back yard !)<br/>
<br/>
I think what people don;t get it is that YOU NEED to BE THERE a lot and do it with them.<br/>
As they get older they may not need you as much but even a 11 years old likes to do things with the parents. <br/>
I see some parents sit back and expect kids to go do things on their own. Some will do it, at least for a while. But I guarantee you that if you join them in exploring  things will be so much more fun to them and to you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-972709097">Think about your hobbies.  That is an ideal place to start.  Yard sales are<br/>
great for tennis rackets, stuff to tinker with, and roller blades.  Whatever<br/>
you enjoy your kids will enjoy.  My husband and I bought a telescope for the<br/>
guys, but until we actually brought it out with snacks and made ourselves<br/>
comfy using it the kids were not interested.  Its not just about their<br/>
interests, it is about yours, too.<br/>

<br/>
Maybe not always, but whatever parents do NOT enjoy, what they treat  <br/>
as yucky medicine or things kids have to do, kids will NOT enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
I have hobbies my kids don&#39;t care about much, but because I&#39;ve  <br/>
supported and participated in and hung out around their interests that  <br/>
weren&#39;t really mine, they&#39;re willing to reciprocate.  They&#39;ve learned  <br/>
generosity and attention and trust because I trusted and was generous  <br/>
with them.<br/>
<br/>
YES to those who pointed out that kids don&#39;t want to do things  <br/>
themselves.  Unschooling isn&#39;t about acting like you don&#39;t have kids  <br/>
while kids act like they don&#39;t have parents.   TOGETHERNESS is the  <br/>
magic ingredient, if there is one, in unschooling.  It won&#39;t work  <br/>
otherwise.  It might &quot;work&quot; but in some half-ass, the-kid-survived- <br/>
anyway way, not in the optimal glorious unschooling way some of the  <br/>
people here are trying to share with others here.<br/>
<br/>
Be with your kids.  If you&#39;re wondering &quot;how much?&quot; the answer is  <br/>
probably &quot;more.&quot;<br/>

Well, they might not enjoy a good winetasting at their age lol<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking of what Sandra said, but she said it better:  they won&#39;t<br/>
enjoy &quot;yucky medicine&quot;.  The kids won&#39;t enjoy a parent having &quot;stuff that is<br/>
good for them&quot; around, if the parents don&#39;t enjoy it as a pass time and<br/>
present it as fun.<br/>
<br/>
Our telescope was bought when our kids showed an interest, but we figured<br/>
out how to use it comfortably as a family.  Until we got it to work and<br/>
learned more about it, the did the kids were not interested in it.  Lots of<br/>
people buy telescopes, microscopes, or hobby sets but if the parents present<br/>
it as &quot;work&quot; or boring or something they are tolerating only to enrich the<br/>
child or don&#39;t take the trouble to make a bit of a production of it kids<br/>
will ignore it.  Again, the telescope worked when we snuggled drinking<br/>
something warm together taking turns looking at a faraway disk with other<br/>
disks(Jupiter and moons).  Buying even the most expensive hobby sets and<br/>
leaving them to be discovered is not the same as buying it and enjoying it<br/>
together.<br/>
<br/>
sample low key talk:<br/>
<br/>
I thought I it would be fun if we &lt;insert activity&gt;.  Do you want to join<br/>
me?<br/>
<br/>
If they make a counteroffer--go with it.  Make it pleasant and comfy for<br/>
yourself and for them to engage. If you suggest basketball and they<br/>
counter with baseball--play baseball, but always think about their comfort.<br/>
Thirst, hunger, tiredness...or injuries can be discouraging. IE if you are<br/>
shooting basketballs or playing baseball, think about cool drinks or getting<br/>
ice cream afterward and enjoying the activity rather than pressure to learn<br/>
rules or get excercise as the goal.  As a parent you anticipate their<br/>
physical needs and draw them out, building trust and fun.  Learning is the<br/>
by-product in all life situations.  Hope this is clear.<br/>
