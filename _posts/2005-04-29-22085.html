<div id="ygrps-yiv-2078283786">Blogs are sort of a cross between a journal, an email list, and a webpage. I think the community aspect is what makes it fun, like an email list... but I&#39;ve also always wanted to keep a diary, and this has been the only way it&#39;s worked so far. Being a linear-minded person, blogging is easier for me that making a webpage... I think the last homepage I made was in, um, 1997.<br/>
<br/>
Rain says she thought Holly didn&#39;t like livejournal... <br/>
<br/>
See, though, if you start a blog on blogger, I can&#39;t comment on it unless I get a blogger account... just like you can&#39;t comment on my xanga without a xanga account... but I think xanga is cooler ;-) For the unschooling mom set, anyway. The comments are what make it a community, that and the blogrings. So quick, move to xanga!<br/>
<br/>
Rain now has a livejournal, a deadjournal, and a xanga. She was telling my dad about this, and he didn&#39;t quite get it, but he interespreted it as menaing that she&#39;s doing lots of &quot;schoolwork&quot; online and this needed a new computer, which is what we got for our birthdays... so it worked out well.<br/>
<br/>
And speaking of blogs, Rain&#39;s cat died on Monday and she&#39;s very sad about it, and she wrote about it on all three of her blogs... so if you want to read her entry about him and maybe drop a comment (if you have a xanga) or email her, she&#39;d appreciate it...<br/>

<br/>
=========<br/>
 <br/>
She thinks it&#39;s not a good thing to have online journals, but maybe because  <br/>
some of her friends had stupid online journals.  Most or all of them have  <br/>
dissolved one way or another since the time several of their friends had them,  <br/>
but none of my kids did.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-And speaking of blogs, Rain&#39;s cat died on Monday and she&#39;s very sad  about <br/>
it, and she wrote about it on all three of her blogs... so if you want to  <br/>
read her entry about him and maybe drop a comment (if you have a xanga) or email <br/>
 her, she&#39;d appreciate it...<br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
My head hurts from trying to find out what Holly can or can&#39;t take into  <br/>
England with her (of the requested stuff, including Mexican jumping beans, but I  <br/>
found a mailorder source for those so we don&#39;t have to find out anymore) so I  <br/>
need to just get away from the computer and maybe sleep.  No more blog/web  <br/>
tonight for me, I hope.<br/>
 <br/>
But I am sorry about the cat.  <br/>
Tomorrow we might look.  Tomorrow&#39;s unscheduled and I don&#39;t expect to  have a <br/>
headache then.<br/>
