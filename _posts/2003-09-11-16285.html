The partitioned hard drive is simply a way for you (or, in this case, the <br/>
previous owner) to save on disk space.  Something about it &#39;tricks&#39; the <br/>
computer into thinking there&#39;s more space for saving stuff, etc.  At least, <br/>
that&#39;s what my husband (computer geek) told me when I inherited one of his <br/>
old partitioned hard drives.  Our new one has so much room, he doesn&#39;t do <br/>
it anymore.<br/>
<br/>
(think of it as folding a paper in half so you can make 4 paper-length <br/>
lists instead of only two.  The paper is useable space on the hard drive <br/>
and the lists are the stuff you&#39;re storing.)<br/>
<br/>
Just use it as if it really has two hard drives instead of only one.  It <br/>
acts just the same.  Or is yours telling you that it&#39;s partitioned, but not <br/>
that it&#39;s two hard drives?<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea where online you&#39;d get info on computer geekiness.  I&#39;ve <br/>
found it&#39;s best to just hang around the geeks themselves and stuff sort of <br/>
rubs off (once they stop talking about things like BUSes and RAM...)<br/>
