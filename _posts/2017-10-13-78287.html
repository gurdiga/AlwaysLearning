<div id="ygrps-yiv-981057966">The internet is pretty wonderful, but pixels are a little like sand or toilet paper.  Some of my webpages are not working as well as they did.  When I find little problems I fix them, but someday if I’m not around or able to fix them, they will gradually go to ruin.<br/>
<br/>
Starting November 2, sayeth Google, my custom web search might not work anymore. I’ve paid $100 a year for the search box at the top here, so use it lots for the next couple of weeks!<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/search">http://sandradodd.com/search</a><br/>
<br/>
Right now (until November 2, 2017 or later) it should be working without advertisements. But that option is not going to be continued.<br/>
<br/>
The box at the bottom of that page covers more sites, but has advertisements.<br/>
<br/>
And another thing about the webpage.  I got this message:<br/>
<br/>
Google systems have tested 860 pages from your site and found that 99% of them have critical mobile usability errors. The errors on these 851 pages severely affect how mobile users are able to experience your website. These pages will not be seen as mobile-friendly by GoogleSearch, and will therefore be displayed and ranked appropriately for smartphone users.<br/>
<br/>
HERE IS WHAT THAT MEANS:<br/>
<br/>
Use a computer. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Look at those pages with a computer and not a phone.<br/>
<br/>
If I were trying to sell you shoes, it would be important (I suppose) for you to buy shoes from your phone, but I’m not selling you shoes. I’m giving you access to some priceless information, and I’m really can’t make those pages friendly to phones.  There’s TOO MUCH on there—lots of reading that can’t possibly be comfortable from a phone.  <br/>
<br/>
The biggest problem is Just Add Light and Stir which isn’t technically on my webpage, but the photos mostly live at Photobucket, which is going up to $400 next year.  I pay $60 now, so I have a year to switch over.   Yeah, it some sort of crazy extortion.  I have two photobucket accounts (long story), and the larger older one, I’ll pay for, at least for a while.  LOTS of things on the website live there.  But the smaller, second account, is only for Just Add Light, so those I will gradually (I hope) upload in another way so Google (owner of blogspot) is keeping them.  <br/>
<br/>
Older websites will turn to ghost towns eventually, and I’m sorry about that, but time marches on and all. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Please, if you find a link or photo that isn’t working, I’d appreciate a note.  Some of my links to Joyce’s older site don’t work, and I can repair them if I know where they are.  <br/>
<br/>
I have an e-mail telling how to migrate the site search to their newer non-paid version, but I want to wait until mine really starts working.  It’s likely they won’t undo it all of a sudden, but it will take a while. :-)  Let me know if you go there and get an error message from Google search. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I loved user groups, and Prodigy mail, and AOL forums, and other forums that have come and been lively and are gone.  This group will someday be a memory.  My website will get ratty.  But right now, this week, it’s pretty great. :-)<br/>
<br/>
If you don’t know what page you might want to look at, here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com">http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com</a><br/>
That star in the upper left is a randomizer.  I have no idea what it will look like on a phone.  You need a computer to get to the pages anyway. :-)<br/>

<br/>
and I’m really can’t fix typos in e-mails, either. :-)  Sorry.  <br/>
<br/>
I’m not trying to be whiney.  I’m hoping to just remind people of impermanence. Your favorite restaurant might not always be there.  You might want to go there at least one more time and maybe take a photo.  Not that the photo will last forever…<br/>
<br/>
There’s a photo with this:<br/>

<br/>
The lamp crashed to the floor the other day; Holly and I were two rooms away.  It was iron and glass, and hook it had been on for years fatigued itself away.<br/>
The white satin and feathery mask that’s on the wall behind it, Holly thinks a friend of hers stole (or borrowed and hasn’t brought it back yet, in nicer terms).<br/>
<br/>
We bought a new, paper lamp and another hook.  Somewhere is a nice photo of Holly in the mask. :-)<br/>
<br/>
After years of living in our yard, this truck was gone:<br/>

<br/>
Dance and eat and sleep and smile.  <br/>
Learn what you can from this group and my site to make your impermanent lives better.<br/>

<br/>
I’ve been paying $100 a year (people have helped me pay for it; thank you) to have a advertisement-free google search function on my page.<br/>
If you look at that page, the top results are shown without ads.  The box at the bottom (which includes other unschooling sites too) has ads.<br/>
<br/>
Soon, mine will have ads, too.  I would rather pay the money, but Google is retiring that option.  <br/>
<br/>
So for two days, if you want to go and play with that, do!<br/>
<br/>
And it’s possible that it will take a while for them to get around to undoing whatever switch is flipped wherever that difference exists, too.  <br/>
