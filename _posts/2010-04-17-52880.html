Tonight my daughter had some schooled friends over and she suggested  <br/>
they play with her electrical experimentation kit until dinner was  <br/>
ready. One friend said simply that he refused to read outside of  <br/>
school and only read as much as they made him for school. What is fun  <br/>
for her has been filed away as miserable for him...<br/>

I&#39;ve known adults who said they hated reading.<br/>
I&#39;ve known teens who said when they got out of school they were never  <br/>
going to read another book again.<br/>
<br/>
Many years ago, talking about this I noted that there are bumper  <br/>
stickers that say &quot;If you can read this, thank a teacher.&quot;  I joked  <br/>
that there should be one that said &quot;If you don&#39;t want to read this,  <br/>
blame a teacher.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Kelly Lovejoy did make some bumper stickers almost like that.  At  <br/>
first I was really embarrassed that it was actually &quot;in vinyl&quot; and on  <br/>
some cars and credited to me, but as the years have gone by my  <br/>
embarrassment has dissolved, because in those eight or nine years, how  <br/>
many tens or hundreds of thousands of non-readers have been created by  <br/>
schools?  I rescind my embarrassment.<br/>
