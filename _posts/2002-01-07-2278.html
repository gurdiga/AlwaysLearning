I am soon to be 37 in February and looking forward to my birthday. My sisters always make me feel so special because they give me lots of gifts on my b-day (and I do the same for them). And I&#39;m not feeling bad about getting older because each year I learn, grow and experience so much. How could I feel bad about that?<br/>
