<div id="ygrps-yiv-544819963"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I wanted to point out a couple more things.  I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;know how close to 17 your neice is but in WA at 17<br/>
&gt;she can become an emancipated minor (ooo a whole year<br/>
&gt;early, I know) as long as no one contests it and it<br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t sound as if her parents would.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Emancipation is an option we have been looking into as<br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;you might consider is getting her into running start<br/>
&gt;at CBC.  <br/>
&gt;Katie<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We moved Katie!  I thought you knew.  Otherwise we<br/>
wold have gotten together more.  We live on the<br/>
Olympic Peninsula now.  But Running Start is a State<br/>
Wide program, so we have been looking into that.  As<br/>
you said though, it means registering with the public<br/>
highschool system first and then going to the college<br/>
through them, and I don&#39;t think we want to so that.<br/>
<br/>
Update:<br/>
Her second California Highschool Exit Exam came back. <br/>
She missed it by two points this time, missed it by<br/>
one point the first time she took it, last year. <br/>
Given her phobia of tests I think it is pretty safe to<br/>
say that her stress is affecting her ability to<br/>
perform on the exams.  I told her she aught to take<br/>
the two test results, all her scholarly awards and<br/>
certificates, and as many letters of recommendation<br/>
from teachers and administrators at her school as she<br/>
can get, and go to the school board to ask that they<br/>
pass her.  She has been a peer tutor and has worked<br/>
for the last two years at her Highschool as a<br/>
teacher&#39;s aide (making real money) at the Independent<br/>
Study school she attends.  She is very mature and<br/>
intelligent and capable and I think they should just<br/>
let her go already.  She obviously has the knowledge<br/>
base and is just not performing well enough on the<br/>
test.  That&#39;s obvious by her identical performance on<br/>
the test both years, regardless of another year of<br/>
school gone by.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-147895255">Yeah, I knew, now that you mention it.  Guess it slipped my <br/>
mind.  :)  With her history and educational susesses it sounds as if <br/>
something will definatly work out.  It always seems to.  My Nephew <br/>
(16 in feb) is having the exact opposite problem.  His grades are so <br/>
bad the public schools are refusing to let him attend anymore (also <br/>
in California).  I wish I could get him up here with me but his <br/>
parents will never let him go.  And they are very against homeschool <br/>
but that&#39;s a whole different issue.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
