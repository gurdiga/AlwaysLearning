<div id="ygrps-yiv-1957602463">I just want to say thanks to every one for the replies to my jobs for <br/>
unschoolers post. For some reason Yahoo is not playing nice with me <br/>
and I&#39;m not getting any group emails, but I read everything on the <br/>
web, and it was very helpful. I have no doubts that my son will find <br/>
work that is meaningful and satisfying to him, but it&#39;s nice to see <br/>
others that have gone before. :)<br/>
