<div id="ygrps-yiv-668793690">Hi everyone.  I hope you&#39;re all having a happy Halloween.  My little <br/>
ghosts are all chowing on candy and watching &quot;Castle in the Sky.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have a little awkward situation that I&#39;m not sure how to handle and I <br/>
was hoping for some advice.  Quick background info: I have for dd&#39;s <br/>
under 7 with the littlest who&#39;s going to be 1 on Nov. 30th.  So...for <br/>
the last 6 months I&#39;ve told the girls that I will no longer send them <br/>
places that they don&#39;t want to go and that if they choose they can stay <br/>
with me.  So for almost all of the last 6 months we&#39;ve been together. <br/>
 They never would really go anywhere anyway, except to their <br/>
grandparents houses while dh and I went on a date.  Now, my mom is okay <br/>
if the girls say they want to go home or whatever, but my mil just won&#39;t <br/>
let them call me if they feel they need to.  She also puts my 3 yr old <br/>
in time out A LOT and usually it&#39;s because my 4 yr old niece tattled on <br/>
her for something she didn&#39;t even do.  And my mil only invites my girls <br/>
if my niece is going and due to many unfortunate circumstances, my niece <br/>
is become VERY manipulative and sneaky.  The older girls try to stick up <br/>
for their little sister, but my mil refuses to believe anyone but my <br/>
niece.  Also, with my baby who&#39;s always slept with me and the older <br/>
girls, when she&#39;s with mil and she starts to cry, my mil puts in a crib <br/>
upstairs and tries to just leave her there.  Usually my oldest just goes <br/>
up and gets in the crib, too, but it breaks my heart to think my baby <br/>
would have to go through that when she really just needs to be held.<br/>
<br/>
So tonight, my mil said she&#39;d watch the girls tomorrow night so dh and I <br/>
could go out.  My mom also said she wanted the girls.  Dh said they HAVE <br/>
to go to his mom&#39;s and that they should just learn that sometimes they <br/>
have to go where they don&#39;t want to.  I just feel sick about the whole <br/>
thing and to be frank, now the last thing I want is to go out with dh <br/>
cause I&#39;m so frustrated that he is so uninterested in his own children.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, what would you all do?  I think I&#39;ll have to have a talk with my <br/>
mil, but she&#39;s such a now-it-all and NEVER admits she might be wrong. <br/>
 Should I bother to talk to her?  HELP!<br/>
<br/>

It&#39;s so hard to deal with grandparents who just don&#39;t get it.  I would try to talk to her about it first.  Maybe explaining that everyone -- her included -- will have a more pleasant visit if she can try to not let the baby cry it out.  However, the whole situ with the niece is just toxic, and I&#39;m not sure how to approach that one.  We&#39;re lucky in that my Mom does get our choices, and dh is an only child so there are no unpleasant cousins.  My own standard is that I certainly never require my kids to spend time with anyone who mistreats them, even if that person is another child.  If your mil won&#39;t see the problem, then IMO the kids shouldn&#39;t be there when their cousin is visiting.<br/>
 <br/>
IF after explaining things to her and asking for her support -- and more importantly -- getting dh&#39;s support on this issue, things aren&#39;t better I&#39;d just do my best to graciously avoid letting the kids be alone with mil.  My Dad is somewhat like this, so I&#39;ve never allowed my kids to be alone with him visiting.  Maybe the occasional errand or such, but he&#39;s just not a safe place for my kids so we don&#39;t do that.  With him, in particular, I did have a problem some years ago with him saying/doing things I didn&#39;t like while visiting in my home.  I finally had to tell him how I felt, that it needed to stop right now.  When he put on his &#39;hurt feelings&#39; act, I reminded him that I&#39;m the mother now, and the only way he sees his grandchildren is on my terms -- take it or leave it.  He changed his ways -- at least around my kids.<br/>
 <br/>
I think first, it&#39;s really important to get your dh to see how much her treatment damages the kids.  <br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Tia and Sylvia, you&#39;re both right.  I know I need to talk to dh about <br/>
it, but I really don&#39;t want to.  He&#39;s in the process of trying to keep <br/>
his brand new company afloat and it&#39;s sinking fast and he&#39;s the sole <br/>
income earner, so I don&#39;t really want to talk to him about it because to <br/>
him it&#39;s just not that important and no matter how much it matters to me <br/>
and the girls, it just doesn&#39;t to him.  The way he sees it is that they <br/>
kids and they&#39;ll just have to work it out themselves.  Obviously I don&#39;t <br/>
feel that way.<br/>
<br/>
I talked to the girls a lot about it tonight.  I was worried they <br/>
wouldn&#39;t want their Nani to know about things they&#39;ve told me.  But they <br/>
said I could tell her.  It really does come down to my niece.  But up <br/>
until last weekend, I never had a really strong case to argue because I <br/>
was never there when things happened.  But last Sunday, my mil asked me <br/>
to watch my niece so that she and my sil could paint some rooms in her <br/>
new house.  BTW, sil is divorced and very aggressive, spiteful, and full <br/>
of woe for herself (not just because of her life now, she&#39;s just always <br/>
been that way.)  Anyway, the whole day, Alexis (niece) kept telling <br/>
Soleille (my 3 yr old) that she couldn&#39;t play with them because they <br/>
were only playing &quot;big girl&quot; games.  I had to keep telling her, &quot;no, in <br/>
this house everybody gets to play.&quot;  So after Alexis went home, I find <br/>
out that she told my sil that  she was a bad mom because she smoked. <br/>
 When asked where she heard that she said, &quot;AZ&quot; meaning Aislinn, my 7 yr <br/>
old.  Well, of course my mil and sil just believed her and I KNOW it <br/>
wasn&#39;t true because I was with them all day.  Anyway... I&#39;m going to <br/>
talk to her tomorrow as tactfully as I can.<br/>
<br/>
As far as dh goes,  he&#39;s never been really all that interested in the <br/>
girls and I never even asked him how he felt about my homeschooling and <br/>
then unschooling.  We&#39;ve talked about it a bit here and there but I just <br/>
feel like if he&#39;s not interested why should I have to ask him or discuss <br/>
it with him.  Oh, I&#39;m just wandering of the subject now...sorry.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway thanks for the advice.  Anyone know how to convince a mil to <br/>
change?  According to my dh, she&#39;s always used a time-out chair.  I did <br/>
tell my two older girls that if she put Soleille in the time-out chair, <br/>
they should just go sit with her and if Nani told them they had to <br/>
leave, they should just say no and if she got mad, they could say, &quot; <br/>
see, we&#39;re being bad too so we need to be in time-out.&quot;  At least then <br/>
Soleille wouldn&#39;t have to be there all alone.  Also, and ironically, my <br/>
sil used to always get my dh in trouble for things he didn&#39;t do.  Could <br/>
it be genetic?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1521517474">I wouldn&#39;t bother talking to mil, because I wouldn&#39;t leave my children with<br/>
her again except in the most dire emergency (in other words not for a date,<br/>
maybe for a house fire).<br/>
<br/>
When we had tiny dependent children, Wally and I came to accept that private<br/>
couple time was going to be in very short (often non-existent) supply. Life<br/>
is a series of cycles, and the raising-children-under-five cycle is hard,<br/>
but not impossible, if both parents can recognize that it doesn&#39;t last<br/>
forever. Frankly, it was difficult to convince Wally that our sex life would<br/>
EVER be &quot;normal&quot; (for us) again. It gets easier. ;)<br/>
<br/>
Tell your husband that you&#39;re happy to leave them with your mother (if you<br/>
are) and that&#39;s the only way you feel comfortable leaving them right now. If<br/>
you don&#39;t speak up for your daughters, who will?<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1742163505">There is no way in hell I&#39;d let my children go visit your mil without me <br/>
right there to supervise things.  You have many years for dates, when <br/>
your own children are old enough to stay with each other, or when they <br/>
are out of the house.  Right now, my focus is my children, their needs <br/>
while they are small and need me so much.  It will come all too soon <br/>
that my children will need me less and I can do what I want. <br/>
<br/>
Letting children cry in a crib is abusive, in my opinion.  Not letting <br/>
children call their mother is also abusive.  I also am deciding that I <br/>
no longer believe in Time Out, at least not in the way most people do <br/>
it.  I did put a sixth grader in time out today at the halloween dance, <br/>
as I had warned him about five time sthat he needed to settle down and <br/>
stop running through the crowds of kids, but basically I just simply <br/>
walked him outside and asked him to take a few minutes and then he could <br/>
come back into the dance.  He just needed a break from the action.  It <br/>
wasn&#39;t punitive, it was a break.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you might need to have a long talk with your husband <br/>
about how you wish to parent your children, because what you describe <br/>
your mil doing is not respectful parenting, and if your husband really <br/>
is going along with it, and doesn&#39;t respect your kids and their needs <br/>
and opinions, then he is also not practicing loving and respectful <br/>
parenting.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, just saying it like I see it, based on your description below. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Everyone has covered my suggestions (talk to mil, if no changes don&#39;t leave<br/>
them there alone).  But I had to address dh&#39;s comment.  This is something<br/>
adults say so often and it drives me crazy!  Adults do NOT have to go<br/>
places or do things they don&#39;t want to.  We have choices!  If an adult<br/>
finds themselves doing things or going places they don&#39;t want to it is time<br/>
to examine why.  Life is full of choices for adults.  I want my children to<br/>
realize that and making sure they can make decisions for themselves now is<br/>
crucial to that.  I don&#39;t want them to be bitter adults that believe they<br/>
have no control over their lives and happiness.  I would never stay in a<br/>
place that locked me in a room when I was upset or punished me and<br/>
separated me from my loved ones.  Why in the world should your children be<br/>
forced to do that?  <br/>
<br/>
Your children can enjoy your mil presence with you there and maybe she<br/>
could see some different ways to handle unexpected situations.  4 under 7<br/>
is a lot, if they aren&#39;t your own, she may just need some tools.  It sounds<br/>
like dh is going through a difficult time at work but again we all have<br/>
choices.  Your girls have shared their feelings with you and I hope they<br/>
will feel heard and important and protected.  It probably took a lot for<br/>
them to share their feelings about their dad&#39;s mom and their cousin.  <br/>
<br/>
Good luck!  Anna</div>

I would talk to her. I would talk to DH first though. I would impress on him <br/>
what it feels like to be small. Remember when you were a kid and your <br/>
grandma&#39;s house was so big and she was so old and tall? Even if she was in her early <br/>
fifties and was only five feet four inches? Remind him of that. Remind him of <br/>
the strange shadows at night and the creaks and groans of an unfamiliar house. <br/>
Remind him what it feels like to only want one thing when you are scared and <br/>
uncomfortable and that is the comfort of parents and a familiar bed and the <br/>
smell of your very own pillow. When he gets that picture then both of you can go <br/>
to her and talk to her about the problems and ways you want things done. One <br/>
thing I always remind Darin when we have a conflict with his mom is that she <br/>
had her chance to be the parent, it&#39;s our turn now. <br/>

Should I bother to talk to her?  HELP!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If I really felt that way about my husband and my MIL, then I think I would <br/>
just stay home with the kids.  I don&#39;t need to go out so bad that I&#39;d put my <br/>
kids with someone who doesn&#39;t treat them well.  <br/>

If your mil won&#39;t see the problem, then IMO the kids shouldn&#39;t be there when <br/>
their cousin is visiting.<br/>
<br/>
I have a hunch the MIL doesn&#39;t want ANY kids around her, really, but feels <br/>
obligated...and she will only take the niece if there are kids there to play <br/>
with her.  <br/>

&lt;&lt;Tia and Sylvia, you&#39;re both right.  I know I need to talk to dh about <br/>
it, but I really don&#39;t want to.  He&#39;s in the process of trying to keep <br/>
his brand new company afloat and it&#39;s sinking fast and he&#39;s the sole <br/>

him it&#39;s just not that important and no matter how much it matters to me <br/>
and the girls, it just doesn&#39;t to him.  The way he sees it is that they <br/>
kids and they&#39;ll just have to work it out themselves.  Obviously I don&#39;t <br/>
feel that way.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It sounds as though both you and your husband are worried about things that are important to you.  Maybe if you talked to your husband about the company and invited him to share his concerns, he might not feel so alone and stressed. Then you could share your concerns about your mil.  In this situation, you&#39;d be supporting each other, not dumping on him.<br/>
<br/>
As far as leaving your children with your mil, how about digging your heels in and refusing to go out?  This would send the message to your husband that it&#39;s really important to you.  You can spend your &quot;date&quot; time working out a solution instead of worrying about your kids.<br/>

<br/>
If that&#39;s the woman who raised the husband, giving him more of the same <br/>
inflexible treatment won&#39;t convince him of the value of being tender and <br/>
understanding.   Inside many men (and maybe most or all) is a little boy who didn&#39;t get <br/>
enough soft and quiet and could still use some.<br/>
<br/>
My husband&#39;s mom is really controlling.  When I&#39;m there I gently thwart her, <br/>
giving my children permission when I can override her easily.  My favorite <br/>
moment was when she wouldn&#39;t let Marty have dessert when he was three or so <br/>
because he hadn&#39;t finished his plate.   I slid mine over in front of him gently and <br/>
said &quot;Here, Marty, you can have mine.&quot;  It was about two tablespoons of some <br/>
unattractive raisen-compote looking stuff.  Not nearly bread pudding, but <br/>
cheap fruit and mystery stuff.  Marty was calm and grateful and mil didn&#39;t say a <br/>
word.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;ve done when kids are going where the rules are different is just <br/>
coach them before and sympathize after.  It makes them appreciate home better!  <br/>
<br/>
About the time out and crib time, I&#39;d just ask the kids as a group to help <br/>
each other out and don&#39;t leave anyone all alone if she wants company.  <br/>
<br/>
I would make eye contact with the grandmother and say in a friendly voice &quot;If <br/>
they want to call us, let them,&quot; and then say to the childen in her hearing <br/>
&quot;Call if you just want to talk!&quot;<br/>

license.  Taxes - more so - but there are people that don&#39;t pay and you<br/>
could go elsewhere.  Jail absolutely and military but you often do<br/>
something that puts you in those situation (break the law or join the<br/>
military).  My point is that it is a much more positive and powerful<br/>
position to be in to say I am choosing to stand in line at the DMV because<br/>

NYC.  I have many friends there that don&#39;t have driver&#39;s license.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-503173936">&lt;&lt;What would you all do?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I can only answer what I did.  I was working with the teenaged hs kids on a<br/>
play.  We did one last year, had a ball.  Pretty much unschooled it, as in<br/>
the kids did all the decisions about it, etc.  It was a ball and a very good<br/>
performance.  The parents loved the end result, hated every minute of their<br/>
kids making decisions.  ANYWAY... Fast forward to this year, we have 2<br/>
practices and my kids are playing in the gym while we are in a classroom at<br/>
a local church.  I hear afterward from my oldest that one of the moms was<br/>
mean to my 10yo, shaking her finger in his face and yelling at him for<br/>
playing with a volleyball in the gym.  (He didn&#39;t know it was off limits.)<br/>
Zach never mentioned it to me.  I&#39;m thinking &quot;ok one grouchy mom&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Next week, I get a call complaining that my kids were not following rules,<br/>
etc.  I check with my oldest (almost 13) to make sure she knows what the<br/>
rules are up there.  And she is nodding and following along until it gets to<br/>
&quot;don&#39;t mess with the coke machine&quot; and she rolls her eyes.  I question and<br/>
she says that the coke machine was open and the little 4 year olds were<br/>
messing with it.  Zach (10) was trying to get it to stay shut when a mom<br/>
came in and started yelling at him about the rules.  He tried to explain and<br/>
she cut him off and then apparently went and complained about my kids.  My<br/>
oldest said &quot;She got mad because she didn&#39;t take the time to find out what<br/>
was going on.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So amid tears (because I was having so much fun) I quit the play.  I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be much of a mom if I let people be mean to my kids so I could have<br/>
fun.<br/>

If you talked to the finger-wagging mom (wagging your finger in her face as <br/>
you tell her it&#39;s scary, isn&#39;t it? isn&#39;t illegal; it&#39;s tacky, but I&#39;d do it if <br/>
it were me) maybe you&#39;d keep her finger out of other people&#39;s faces in the <br/>
future too.   And you could tell coke-mom that your kids are NOT trained to hang <br/>
back and let other kids get in trouble, and that your son was trying to help <br/>
KEEP the peace/rules and that he is unaccustomed to being treated less than <br/>
fully human.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thank you EVERYONE for your advice.  I did talk to my mil this morning <br/>
and at first she got all defensive and then after awhile she talked more <br/>
calmly, but she&#39;s still very upset.  She continued to defend my sil as a <br/>
poor, overworked single parent and to defend my niece as the poor only <br/>
child of divorced parents.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love my niece and do <br/>
feel sorry for her, but not enough for my children to suffer.  I learned <br/>
also from my mil that my sil is very upset because my oldest, Aislinn, <br/>
7, is rude to her.  I&#39;ve talked to Aislinn about that and explained that <br/>
she can choose to behave as she wishes to all people but she has to <br/>
realize that there will always be consequences and sometimes they won&#39;t <br/>
be pleasant.  So part of all this could be consequences coming back to <br/>
haunt her.<br/>
<br/>
News Flash!  I just left this e-mail hanging here and had a long talk <br/>
with the girls and we&#39;ve figured out a way that they can go to Nani&#39;s <br/>
and hardly ever, dare I say never, get into trouble for anything!  I <br/>
told them that whenever there was an upset, an arguement, or whatever <br/>
between them and their cousin or even each other- they should run to <br/>
Nani and say in a very sweet voice, &quot;Nani, we need YOUR help.  We want <br/>
everyone to be happy.  What should we do?&quot;  This way Nani gets to feel <br/>
important, the problem will get somewhat solved, and nobody can ever say <br/>
that the girls were bad.  LOL.  It might made them seem like <br/>
goody-two-shoes, but it will solve their problem in an honest way <br/>
without accusations or blame being placed on anyone.  I would like them <br/>
to learn how to solve these confrontations in a fair and calm way, so <br/>
maybe this will help with that.  If not, at least it will take the heat <br/>
of them for a little while.  In the last couple hours, we&#39;ve been <br/>
practicing it with problems they&#39;ve been having with each other, and <br/>
they are solving them on there own in ways that will make &#39;everyone <br/>
happy.&#39;  I even called my mil and told her this and she&#39;s thrilled and <br/>
says she&#39;ll help Alexis learn how to do this, too.<br/>
<br/>
AND, dh called this morning from work to apologize for his attitude last <br/>
night.  That&#39;s a HUGE step for him because he is a lot like his mom, who <br/>
never want to admits she&#39;s wrong.  I really didn&#39;t want to call off the <br/>
date.  I never really get to see him anymore and he&#39;s going through a <br/>
really hard time in his life.  Sandra&#39;s right, I think husbands, <br/>
especially mine, need to treated gently.  And I think he feels a little <br/>
jealous that I&#39;m so focused on the kids.  I ask him about what&#39;s going <br/>
on at work, but we have 4 little kids, and he never gets more than 2 <br/>
sentences out before we&#39;re interupted and I have to leave to go help <br/>
someone.  He&#39;s under so much stress that I&#39;ve been worried a lot about <br/>
his health because of it and he NEEDS a night out to see a movie or <br/>
something.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I feel so much better.  I strongly feel that there&#39;s almost <br/>
always a solution if you really work at it.  And I think that this will <br/>
work.  And the girls feel good about it too.  Nani feels good about it. <br/>
 Things look pretty good all around.    Thank you again for all your help.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-447939070">&lt;&lt;and I&#39;ll tell them BE NICE&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps they would listen to you  &lt;grin&gt;.  I tried over and over for several<br/>
years to work with these people (In Your Face Christian School-At-Homers).<br/>
Finally gave up on them.  Your right it wasn&#39;t my only choice but I was too<br/>
tired of fighting with them over everything.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You can&#39;t let kids make these decisions.  What if they wanted to do the<br/>
scene nude?!?!?&quot; (parents wanting me to force the kids to omit the word<br/>
&quot;ass&quot; from Shakespeare<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You obviously don&#39;t have the guts to make a decision.&quot; (when the kids<br/>
decisions didn&#39;t match this particular parent&#39;s on certain limits for the<br/>
group)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Why are we even sending our kids to you anyway?&quot; (when I told a parent that<br/>
I wasn&#39;t interested in molding their child, only wanted to have fun doing<br/>
Shakespeare)<br/>
<br/>
It just got very old and the meanness to MY kids was the last straw.  Found<br/>
a group of mostly unschoolers, a UU church and I&#39;m much happier.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; So amid tears (because I was having so much fun) I quit the play.  I<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t be much of a mom if I let people be mean to my kids so I could<br/>
have<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; fun.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Unfair, though!  Those weren&#39;t really your only two choices.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you talked to the finger-wagging mom (wagging your finger in her face<br/>
as<br/>
&gt; you tell her it&#39;s scary, isn&#39;t it? isn&#39;t illegal; it&#39;s tacky, but I&#39;d do<br/>
it if<br/>
&gt; it were me) maybe you&#39;d keep her finger out of other people&#39;s faces in the<br/>
&gt; future too.   And you could tell coke-mom that your kids are NOT trained<br/>
to hang<br/>
&gt; back and let other kids get in trouble, and that your son was trying to<br/>
help<br/>
&gt; KEEP the peace/rules and that he is unaccustomed to being treated less<br/>
than<br/>
&gt; fully human.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh heck, send me  their e-mail addresses and I&#39;ll tell them to BE NICE,<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; to call you and apologize, and ask you to come back and help with that<br/>
play or<br/>
&gt; they&#39;ll risk... a second e-mail from ME. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

Well on a related note, a friend wants to borrow our video of the South Park <br/>
movie, but I can only find the tape and  not the box.  That&#39;s okay, because I <br/>
can make a new tape box (I live by a Hollywood video and they put some cool <br/>
stuff out sometimes) so I went to google to find some sites with art or cast <br/>
listing or blurb to swipe, print, slip into the plastic sleeve, all cool-like.<br/>
<br/>
One of the first ones I found was a fundy Christian criticism of the movie.   <br/>
They COUNTED how many words were used how.  They called (the cartoon) Saddam <br/>
Hussein&#39;s (fake cartoon) penis &quot;disembodied.&quot;  WHAT!?  I don&#39;t think that word <br/>
means what they think it means.  But anyway, look at this line:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;These are but a very few of the examples of ignominy in this sinematic <br/>
cyanide.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I like it.  It&#39;s deep.   (no really)<br/>
But I wonder about that misspelling of &quot;cinematic.&quot;   Judging by the rest of <br/>
the &quot;review&quot; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s humor or a pun.  Is it just someone who <br/>
doesn&#39;t know the word &quot;cinema&quot;?  Is he so used to writing about &quot;sin&quot; that <br/>
everything becomes sin-something?   Is he suggesting the movie creates an automatic <br/>
flood of sin?  Would he think porn was SINamatography?   Would a robot of Satan <br/>
be a Sinematron?<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t take it seriously, but I might print it out to slip in the cover of <br/>
the video box.   <br/>

It&#39;s the second site google brings up for &quot;South Park Movie.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes it&#39;s an obnoxious offensive movie, but also a great parody of musicals <br/>
and they MEANT it to be funny that Satan was a nicer guy than Hussein, and it <br/>
wasn&#39;t intended to be taken as a literal recommendation of Satan.   He took <br/>
everything literally and at face value.  <br/>
<br/>
I like this line too:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;. . . and repeated questions about a female private organ were but a very <br/>
few of the vulgar expressions used by the kids.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Clitoris.<br/>
The word was &quot;clitoris.&quot;   Is that really &quot;an organ&quot;?  How many private <br/>
organs do they think females have?   &quot;Clitoris&quot; is not a vulgar expression.   Ass, <br/>
as used by Shakespeare, is vulgar, especially the way Michael Keaton <br/>
repeatedly repeats the word in the repetitious scene in Much Ado about Nothing, in <br/>
which he tells anyone who will listen that the guy called him an ass.  Ass as it&#39;s <br/>
used in the Bible when Jesus rode one, and Mary rode one, that&#39;s vulgar, <br/>
literally, because it&#39;s the everyday speech of normal people, unlike &quot;clitoris&quot; <br/>
which is the technical foreign word used to be lofty and removed.<br/>

<br/>
With all the discussions going on with my girls and my mil, I found out <br/>
that my niece got in trouble at day-care for getting the others kids to <br/>
stuff pillows in their shirts and pretend they were pregnant.  Turns out <br/>
this really upset a lot of the kids&#39; parents.  Alexis learned this from <br/>
my girls who will even go grocery shopping with me in their pregnant <br/>
state.  I told the girls that if these parents don&#39;t want their kids to <br/>
learn stuff, they should keep their kids at home!  Good grief!  A <br/>
pregnant belly....were do those babies come from anyway???  Perhaps we <br/>
should advocate the stork or cabbage leaf method to keep everyone happy.<br/>
<br/>
Dh and I went on our date.  We saw School of Rock...a pretty good <br/>
unschooling movie, I think.  All the girls chose not to spend the night <br/>
at Nani&#39;s which made their cousin cry, but I just patted her on the head <br/>
and said, &quot;Well, sometimes you just want you&#39;re mommy, too.&quot; <br/>
 Unfortunately, she&#39;s never given the choice to go home with her mommy.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, I can imagine how it must feel to think Holly might go to <br/>
school.  Yuck.  But I agree with everyone that she probably just wants a <br/>
taste and then she&#39;ll let it go, if it ever even comes to that.</div>
