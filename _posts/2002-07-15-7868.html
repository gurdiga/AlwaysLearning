<div id="ygrps-yiv-389173530">The Mineral Museum of MT Tech of the University of Montana, hosts summer<br/>
programs for kids and adults like some other colleges are doing these<br/>
days.    This one especially &quot;rocks&quot; &lt;snort&gt; because they&#39;re always<br/>
geology programs and field trips and my son is a born prospector. <br/>
Saturday we went on one of their field trips.  <br/>
The man who&#39;s lately been the guide on these trips is Ed Laird, a self<br/>
taught rock hound who found the 400lb smokey quartz crystal  now on<br/>
display at the Museum.<br/>
If you&#39;ve never seen a 400 pound smokey quartz crystal, well, it&#39;s big.  <br/>
He found it at a place called Pipestone Flats, which is where he led this<br/>
field trip with the hope of seeing all the little kids find a good<br/>
crystal or two.  The trouble was, most of the folks on the trip were<br/>
adults and geologists, a happy accident for my son and pretty interesting<br/>
for Mr. Laird too, it seemed.   Last year when we went there were a lot<br/>
of homeschool kids and some adults who were, yes, geologist, so Dylan<br/>
remembered that, and when he saw all the adults this time he simply asked<br/>
&quot;Excuse me, are you a geologist?&quot;   Yup.<br/>
The guy who drove our van was a (guess!) geologist at the Dept. of Mines<br/>
and Geology. A very cool guy.  The museum director, also on the trip, was<br/>
a hydro geologist. So, for six hours Dylan had direct access to smart<br/>
folks who loved talking about rocks.  Nothing is better when you&#39;re ten<br/>
and you have a rock pick and a big idea that you can dig up anything.<br/>
Pipestone Flats is just spitting distance from the continental divide, if<br/>
you know how to really launch one, and high elevation, open sage-brushy<br/>
country with some junipers and Douglas fir, but sparse.  Turns out it&#39;s<br/>
the perfect place to find crystals, where granite meets feldspar in bony<br/>
ridges that jut out of the ground like a dragons back.   If any of you<br/>
have ever been over  Homestake pass you&#39;ll know what I mean about the<br/>
granite.  Massive ancient boulders have weathered out of the ground here<br/>
like giant vertebrae, spectacular and rugged.<br/>
It was hideously hot.  I know you folks who live where it&#39;s 100 degrees<br/>
and 100% humidity can&#39;t abide whiners like me, but 107 in Montana is hot<br/>
because it&#39;s just not supposed to get 107 in Montana.  Not where I live<br/>
anyway, up north and down south some, Great Falls and Billings ( hello<br/>
Lisa and Dana ) but not here.  Really, it just doesn&#39;t happen.   <br/>
We walked and poked and dug and sweated and crowded into the shade when<br/>
we found some and told stories about finding great rocks or, like<br/>
fishermen, about losing the big one to some other rock hound.   <br/>
It was a marvelous day, and we did find crystals!  Dylan found a pocket<br/>
full of smoky quarts - two rather large ones, a nice clear quartz crystal<br/>
about three inches long,  and others that were smaller, some green<br/>
epidote, and two very nice axinite.  We filled up another egg carton and<br/>
started a new dish of rocks on the bookshelf and decided to go dig<br/>
sapphires or pan for gold next weekend.  It&#39;s supposed to cool off to the<br/>
frosty mid eighties.  Yea Haw! <br/>
Anyway, this was going somewhere, Ed Laird is in the early, beginning<br/>
stages of writing a book about his adventures digging for rocks.  About<br/>
how he learned by doing, and by being curious and patient and observant<br/>
and about how he taught himself to cut gemstones and make jewelry and<br/>
take little kids and big geologist on hot field trips.  And about digging<br/>
400 pound crystals out of Pipestone Flats.<br/>
It should be a good book for unschoolers.  <br/>
