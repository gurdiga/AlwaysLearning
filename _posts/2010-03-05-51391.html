<br/>
Okay....<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not going to talk about the economic reasons why I think unschooling is more accessible to the middle and upper classes as these are pretty self-evident.  Instead, I&#39;ll talk about one of my own personal problems with homeschooling, which is that I often feel as if I&#39;ve turned my back on the rest of the youth in our country.  This pains me.  I wish that all children had the chance to grow and learn freely and that they could all be nourished by caring adults who&#39;ve decided to make them a priority.  Imagine our world!<br/>
<br/>
But this just isn&#39;t the case. It isn&#39;t true for the schools and it isn&#39;t true for many families.  I remember how active my parents were in the public school I attended until 6th grade.  They actively fought to change a broken system and they were surprisingly successful.  Lots of young people, not just their children, benefited from their actions.<br/>
<br/>
So in some ways the point about &quot;middle-class privilege&quot; draws me to the reverse side of the equation:  if the people who care the most about reform (homeschoolers) are the people who take their kids out of the schools, who will be left to fight for the change our kids so desperately need? <br/>
<br/>
However, I&#39;m not willing to sacrifice my daughter to a system I feel is harmful--and I think I&#39;m *allowed* to make this choice because I come from a place that gives me confidence I can succeed without &quot;the system.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
If you caught the Discovery program last night, you heard the unschoolers&#39; neighbor talk about her concerns--there was genuine fear in her voice when she asked something like, &quot;how can you go to college if you don&#39;t spend your life in school?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
People, parents especially, have been led to believe that they lack the knowledge to do something--anything-- without an expert (or institution) leading the way.  School has been touted as the great equalizer; if you &quot;stay in school&quot; you can be anything you want to be.  It is hard to turn your back on the hope schooling offers when you&#39;re surrounded by people living &quot;hopeless&quot; existences.<br/>
<br/>
I know that there has been research showing that the level of parent schooling has no bering on the success of homeschooling, but that doesn&#39;t help people who don&#39;t know how or where to look for such comforting &quot;facts.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I used to talk about homeschooling with the woman who cleaned my office. She is from Mexico and went to school until she was twelve.  The most important thing to her, was making sure her granddaughter finished school.  This woman is one of the wisest women I&#39;ve ever met.  Yet she would never believe herself capable of facilitating a decent education for her granddaughter.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the unschoolers I know are very well educated. I know my own education has shown me how easy it is to learn when I&#39;m interested (and how much crap, which I immediately forgot, had to be swallowed just to get to the part I was interested in)--and this in turn allows me the ability to feel safe with our decisions to unschool.  I think it is a much harder choice for people who feel they could have gone farther in life had they only had a better education.  It isn&#39;t a *lack* of an education that makes unschooling impossible, it is the fear that goes along with the lack.  It is my suspicion that this fear is built directly into the educational system--the system that gets citizens ready for the hierarchies they&#39;ll need to deal with for the rest of their lives.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m tired and not sure I&#39;m getting my thoughts across clearly.  More anon...<br/>

Homeschooling means, most of the time, that one parent needs to be home. This is especially true with homeschooling young ones. The economic considerations alone are enough to make many people I know push the possibility off the table.</div>

From a purely monetary point of view it may be true that wealthier people can more easily afford to homeschool, but socially and culturally it may be precisely this economic advantage that dissuades them from homeschooling because they have bought in (so to speak) to the whole &#39;education = success&#39; paradigm. Most of the unschoolers I know are at the lower end of the economic spectrum.<br/>

Do homeschoolers really care the most about school reform? I think most homeschoolers believe that fundamentally school cannot be reformed. Spending lots of time and energy on political causes will take away from the parents&#39; ability to be actively engaged with their kids.<br/>

<br/>
Perhaps it&#39;s all about perspective. Three years ago, I was certain I could not homeschool.  I had not yet learned of Unschooling. I, the Mama, support our family. Mama&#39;s are &quot;supposed to be the one&#39;s at home with homeschooled kids,&quot; or so I thought. My DH, who works from home, claimed that he would be &quot;an ineffective teacher, that he could not do this, that he did not want the burden of our children&#39;s education on his shoulders--what if they failed?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Three years ago, I discovered that my beautiful daughter shut down when faced with school. She did things to avoid school that shut me down.  She hid in the pantry, under the covers, in the closet. She refused to get out of bed. She screamed bloody murder when I asked her to get her clothes on. I was mortified. Terrified. Completely clueless as to what to do. All those questions that do harm invaded me, &quot;why is my kid not like the other kids?&quot; &quot;How are we going to manage this?&quot; &quot;How will I deal with the schools and their attendance policies?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I pulled her out of Kindergarten and we told ourselves we&#39;d try it again next year, but we&#39;ll homeschool this year--mostly we just played and lived, and I started reading about Unschooling.  We tried school again the next year at my daughter&#39;s request, and it went okay. I had learned about honoring her choices. If she said she didn&#39;t want to go, I said fine. But most of the time she wanted to go. She went nearly every day. She loved her teacher. Then came 1st grade. And we were back to square one, almost.  I had learned more.  I had been reading and reading and reading about Unschooling.  The more I read, the more I thought it might work for us. That we could MAKE it work.<br/>
<br/>
When the decision came to pull her out of 1st grade, it was a decision that was made joyfully, peacefully, and powerfully.  It was a relief.  And we are making it work. We are a bit &quot;spoiled&quot; in many senses--we have family that lives near us and they support our Unschooling decision. We have been able to modify our schedules so that we, the parents, still spend the majority of time with our kids. I work part-time, but still earn enough to support us, although it&#39;s been pretty tight.<br/>
<br/>
Once our decision to live without school was made, it seems as if we have become more aware of the choices we, the parents, need to make to have it work out. It&#39;s not always easy--there are many days when I wish that I could be the one at home the majority of the time. But I can at least be content in the fact that my children are with people who love them and who are supportive of their day to day.<br/>
<br/>
The most common &quot;rationale&quot; I hear parents use when confronted with the idea of homeschooling is, &quot;I could never do that because I could never be with my kids all day long.&quot;  But I have discovered that the more time I spend with my kids, the more time I want to spend with my kids.  It&#39;s a beautiful feeling to have, and it makes me sad to hear people say it so frequently.<br/>
<br/>
Because I&#39;ve seen my own perspective change and evolve, I think that might be one of the biggest factors involved.</div>

Yes..I see what you are saying--.My thoughts might have been better stated as, &quot;the people who care about doing things differently.....&quot;<br/>

I agree that school, as an institution, is broken beyond repair.  The very institution is flawed from its inception! I guess that&#39;s the one point I keep coming back to.

<br/>
You are absolutely right!  After my parents pulled us out of public school and put us in an alternative (really, very &quot;unschooling-ish&quot;) school, we&#39;d hear about the old school going back to its old ways.  The change only lasted for as long as there were people actively asking for it.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1198535639">You have raised some thought-provoking questions.  You might remember that<br/>
many of us who are home-schooling are also continuing to be active in our<br/>
school systems.  We are home-schooling our daughter for reasons that do NOT<br/>
involve dissatisfaction with our local schools.  We are strong public school<br/>
supporters, so I continue to make the effort to attend school board<br/>
meetings, participate at local school events, volunteer at the local<br/>
elementary school, donate our books and toys there, etc.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So while you frame the question as an &quot;either/or&quot; situation, it&#39;s not.<br/>
Home-schooling families can continue to be involved and in any event, our<br/>
tax dollars still contribute to the public school budgets.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1335394854">I used to worry guiltily, a bit about &quot;abandoning the school system when it <br/>
needs my help&quot;, especially when Jayn was pre-school age and I would meet <br/>
people who staunchly defended school in response to my rather diffident <br/>
&quot;we&#39;re planning to home school&quot;. (Methinks the lady doth protest too much).<br/>
<br/>
BUT now I don&#39;t worry the least bit because I am now convinced that any idea <br/>
for change, any direction that *I* would think positive for school reform, <br/>
would not be remotely what the majority of parents today would *want* from <br/>
their kids&#39; schools.<br/>
<br/>
This would be a case of me saying &quot;they should&quot; instead of them determining <br/>
how they want the school to be. It&#39;s good being done to someone or done for <br/>
someone on their behalf without being what they would ask for. There&#39;s <br/>
enough of that in the school system without my two cents.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t use any school&#39;s services. They can happily take the portion of <br/>
local property tax that my rent represents and use it how they see fit, and <br/>
I will not complain.<br/>
<br/>
Except about the yellow buses speeding down my street. They drive way too <br/>
fast, beyond their own speed limits. Slower buses. That would be my protest <br/>
sign.<br/>

<br/>
I can&#39;t make any other parent, parent their children differently any more than a school can.  Whether we like it or not, there have been and always will be parents that shouldn&#39;t be parents at all.  Nobody can tell me how to parent, just like I can&#39;t tell anyone else how to do so.  The only thing I can do is be a good parent, be the best parent that I can be.  <br/>
<br/>
In so doing, I&#39;m helping grow kinder gentler children who are kinder and gentler with others.  Our house is a refuge to many kids.  Chamille is a source of wisdom and caring to broken others.  It is BECAUSE of unschooling that she is this way.  What we are doing IS helping others.  We haven&#39;t turned our backs on anyone, on the contrary, we&#39;ve embraced those that need help and we are able to do so because we are NOT broken and needing help ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
Chamille is so grounded and strong and capable, I don&#39;t know if I could ever put it in words that would accurately describe the kind of person she is and the kind of compassion she radiates about her.  She sees and knows deeply the hurts of others.  She sees and knows deeply that most of those hurts come from school and parents and the mixture of those.  She lives her life with conviction and others can see and know that there is another way to be.  She is changing the lives of others simply by being herself!

I struggled with this social responsibility when I first withdrew my eldest from school. I have since come to the point that my primary rsponsibility is to my children while they are young. After they have grown and become independent I can invest more time and energy to the greater good.<br/>
<br/>
For myself the answer to who can&#39;t unschool, is the person who can not imagine life another way. I feel that this remains true even years into unschooling when challenges arise, it is the person who can explore a myriad of alternatives who will be most able to find a way to continue unschooling. <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s been my experience that when people really want to homeschool, they find a way. <br/>
<br/>
In my local area, I know many single parents who are still managing to homeschool on fairly low incomes. I know even more families where both parents are working. It&#39;s important to them to homeschool, so they&#39;ve arranged their lives to make it a priority. <br/>
<br/>
The single parents rely on friends and family for child care when they have to be away from their children. None with young children work 40 hours a week away from home, though several with teens do. The couples work different shifts so that the children are almost always with one parent or the other. <br/>
<br/>
I also know several homeschooling families currently dealing with unemployment and underemployment. So far, none have found that sending their children to school would make the financial situation easier.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m from Canada, and I remember when I was first learning about unschooling, combing the internet for information, I came across something posted by a young Aboriginal woman (teen, probably) who had decided to unschool, but her parents, or her family, weren&#39;t happy with her choice. She recognized this was because of now repealed sections of the Indian Act which forbade Aboriginal peoples from education beyond 8th grade.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe those who &quot;can&quot; unschool are those who are not only able to deschool themselves, but decolonize themselves? Kinda theoretical, I know :)<br/>
<br/>
However, I&#39;m reminded of an article I recently read which included a list of the skill-set of decolonization (a lot of which made me think of unschooling): creating space for people to make their own decisions, supporting, creating safety, connecting, attending with compassion, re-integrating, reconnecting, listening, esteeming.</div>

My dad was very actively involved in getting bussing into the Omaha school system. A few years ago they stopped bussing. They decided that separate but equal was better. Huge change and then change back. <br/>

I went to a very cool private school for 2 years. It was a John Holt-esque inspired school. After 2 years my dad could no longer support the idea of taking his influence and his leverage from the public school system and so he put me back into public school. I was smoking by 12 and I dropped out at 17. I don&#39;t know what would have happened in the other environment, but I certainly didn&#39;t feel like I wasn&#39;t learning, like I wasn&#39;t engaged. But I definitely fell through some serious cracks in the public school system. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2123641606">-=-Maybe those who &quot;can&quot; unschool are those who are not only able to  <br/>
deschool themselves, but decolonize themselves? Kinda theoretical, I  <br/>
know :)-=-<br/>
<br/>
This is a my-U.S.-perspective from my nosy-curious upbringing and  <br/>
interest in culture/learning/natural parenting.  It&#39;s not from an  <br/>
official study or anything.  My dad&#39;s mother was an LPN (licensed  <br/>
practical nurse, not a college-degreed registered nurse) after her  <br/>
kids were grown, and had lots of stories for me about hospitals and  <br/>
childbirth and that:<br/>
<br/>
When glass baby bottles and sanitizers and all came into vogue, it was  <br/>
what white women did--what people with money did.  My grandmothers  <br/>
still breastfed; they were poor.  Black women famously breastfed, and  <br/>
there were a few things said about that--that they were, as a group,  <br/>
so resentful that they had raised white babies so long that they were  <br/>
by god going to take good care of their own.  And that they couldn&#39;t  <br/>
afford &quot;modern convenience,&quot; and if they could they would use it.  And  <br/>
there was also something about the separation and resentment-- <br/>
accentuating the difference, maybe?<br/>
<br/>
When La Leche League (conservative Catholic origin) and the hippies  <br/>
(unrelated except for the propensity to breastfeed babies as part of  <br/>
doing what seemed most natural) came along, lots of women started  <br/>
abandoning bottle feeding.  It seemed, and I have heard and read a  <br/>
little, that most of them were white women, and that in those days the  <br/>
rate of bottlefeeding among Black and hispanic families went up and  <br/>
stayed up, and the subsequent government programs in the late 1970&#39;s  <br/>
and 1980&#39;s to try to get women to breastfeed (Breast is Best posters  <br/>
and flyers and billboards) was being rejected by people who *finally*  <br/>
could afford bottles and formula.<br/>
<br/>
That later set also included relatives of my own, because when I went  <br/>
to a family reunion in 1986, when Kirby was four months old, he was  <br/>
one of three infants in the place, and when I wanted to nurse him, I  <br/>
went to the far end of the room.  I had a &quot;nursing top,&quot; something  <br/>
with unobtrusive access and he was nursing while I stood and read  <br/>
bulletin boards about county notices and rodeos and cotton co-ops  <br/>
(Roby, Texas, before a bunch of them won a big lottery) and tried to  <br/>
be by myself.  My Mamaw (dad&#39;s mom) came over and she looked at the  <br/>
notice board too, and stood there a few minutes and then said &quot;I don&#39;t  <br/>
know why those other women won&#39;t FEED THEIR BABIES.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
One homeschooling family in town here came from Houston.  They&#39;re  <br/>
African-American.  The dad has a PhD, works at Sandia National  <br/>
Laboratories, grew up with a little affluence in North Carolina--fancy  <br/>
house, &quot;nice family.&quot;  The mom wasn&#39;t so fortunate.  She was in foster  <br/>
care in NYC.  Her parents were both living, but neither could take  <br/>
care of her.   So the mom was unschooling very happily, being with her  <br/>
own three children as closely and as much as she possibly could; as  <br/>
sweetly and as generously as she could.  The dad, though, was sure  <br/>
that IF his sons could go to school, then they HAD to go to school.   <br/>
So the older one was made to go to the Albuquerque Academy (a prep  <br/>
school) against his will.  The younger one is going to Menaul, another  <br/>
private school, not as fancy.   The girl was allowed to keep  <br/>
unschooling.  She&#39;s going to Stanford, though.<br/>
<br/>
That seemed to follow that pattern of newly-won rights that MUST be  <br/>
exercised.<br/>

They removed their sons from an expensive private school because of the racism they encountered there, and their goal was always getting the kids to Harvard or someplace comparable. Penn-Nasbrit and her husband were both Ivy-League educated, and that ran in the family. At some point in the past, this black family had decided, in a deliberate response to American racism, that they were not going to settle for anything but the best.<br/>
<br/>
It was actually a hard book for me to read, because their homeschooling style was so directive and demanding and coercive. But it was also eye-opening to understand where that drive came from, for them.<br/>

<br/>
Wow...yes...that is a really insightful question.  If I think about postcolonial theory, it makes a lot of sense, especially shifting the &quot;center.&quot;  I think it was Su, who talked about the issues of &quot;authority,&quot; and this plays into your thoughts too.  Perhaps one must be able to de-center authority, which seems to imply a desire/ability/???? to create your own.  Not easy.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps this is why I often hear Yeats&#39; &quot;The Second Coming&quot; (&quot;the center cannot hold&quot;) in my head when I think about schools and schooling:<br/>
<br/>
      THE SECOND COMING<br/>
<br/>
    Turning and turning in the widening gyre <br/>
    The falcon cannot hear the falconer; <br/>
    Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; <br/>
    Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world, <br/>
    The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere <br/>
    The ceremony of innocence is drowned; <br/>
    The best lack all conviction, while the worst <br/>
    Are full of passionate intensity.<br/>
<br/>
    Surely some revelation is at hand; <br/>
    Surely the Second Coming is at hand. <br/>
    The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out <br/>
    When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi <br/>
    Troubles my sight: a waste of desert sand; <br/>
    A shape with lion body and the head of a man, <br/>
    A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun, <br/>
    Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it <br/>
    Wind shadows of the indignant desert birds. <br/>
    The darkness drops again but now I know <br/>
    That twenty centuries of stony sleep <br/>
    Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle, <br/>
    And what rough beast, its hour come round at last, <br/>
    Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?</div>

<br/>
Is that the Colfax family?  I saw the Colfax parents on a panel with  <br/>
Raymond and Dorothy Moore, years ago, either in Los Angeles or  <br/>
Sacramento (the former, I think).  It was near the end of the  <br/>
conference, and not in the main room.  Someone on the panel said  <br/>
something like &quot;Some parents say you just need to love your children,  <br/>
for them to learn&quot; and they snickered and rolled their eyes and  <br/>
started in on how the kids have to WORK, and not goof around.  Being  <br/>
already an unschooler of four or five years at the time, I was  <br/>
appalled, but kind of glad the audience was sparse.<br/>
<br/>
One of them had a political bent.  One family had a religious focus.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m some kind of non-political, agnostic, &quot;just do it&quot; unschooling  <br/>
speaker when I&#39;m at conferences.<br/>

&gt; ***I&#39;m not going to talk about the economic reasons why I think unschooling is more accessible to the middle and upper classes as these are pretty self-evident. Instead, I&#39;ll talk about one of my own personal problems with homeschooling, which is that I often feel as if I&#39;ve turned my back on the rest of the youth in our country. This pains me. I wish that all children had the chance to grow and learn freely and that they could all be nourished by caring adults who&#39;ve decided to make them a priority. Imagine our world!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But this just isn&#39;t the case. ***<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I can&#39;t make any other parent, parent their children differently any more than a school can.  Whether we like it or not, there have been and always will be parents that shouldn&#39;t be parents at all.  Nobody can tell me how to parent, just like I can&#39;t tell anyone else how to do so.  The only thing I can do is be a good parent, be the best parent that I can be.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In so doing, I&#39;m helping grow kinder gentler children who are kinder and gentler with others.  Our house is a refuge to many kids.  Chamille is a source of wisdom and caring to broken others.  It is BECAUSE of unschooling that she is this way.  What we are doing IS helping others.  We haven&#39;t turned our backs on anyone, on the contrary, we&#39;ve embraced those that need help and we are able to do so because we are NOT broken and needing help ourselves.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Chamille is so grounded and strong and capable, I don&#39;t know if I could ever put it in words that would accurately describe the kind of person she is and the kind of compassion she radiates about her.  She sees and knows deeply the hurts of others.  She sees and knows deeply that most of those hurts come from school and parents and the mixture of those.  She lives her life with conviction and others can see and know that there is another way to be.  She is changing the lives of others simply by being herself!  I&#39;ve seen it over and over and over!<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Given the number of kids who are broken by school, there is a part of me that feels a great deal of concern for families who can&#39;t unschool.  I work with inner city kids in aftercare centers and I&#39;m so frustrated by the homework and defeat they are dished out each day that I could sometimes just scream.  It seems to me, and this is only an observation, that if the kids can be involved in even one authentic activity with caring adults, they really turn around into energized kids who can tolerate most of the school nonsense. Heidi was getting dragged down by school and just letting her sleep and do her own thing has done a lot for her.</div>

with really understanding and embracing unschooling - you are rolled  <br/>
up and sunk into the school system.<br/>
<br/>
When your thoughts are involved (every day?) with the aftermath of  <br/>
school, you can&#39;t but think of trying remedies that are schoolish.<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be paramount to separate yourself from your work  <br/>
mentally and emotionally. Then you can approach life differently with  <br/>
your daughter, once she has finished deschooling.<br/>
