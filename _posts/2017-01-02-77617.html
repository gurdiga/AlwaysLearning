That would have been SUCH a good idea!  Thank you.  Yes!  Here (I hope) it is…<br/>

I had it cut and copied in my hand but failed to paste.  So weird, to be able to carry a thing around like that, ghostlike.  I love when I have cut to paste and then get up and go do something, and when I come back to the computer, it’s still ready to paste.  :-)  And that’s not a new thing.  That’s over 25 years old, I think. :-)<br/>
