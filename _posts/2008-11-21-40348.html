<div id="ygrps-yiv-1335472628">This is a response to an e-mail by a list member who was worried that  <br/>
this issue might be too rough for people new to unschooling.  It  <br/>
might be disturbing to some, but it might help that I&#39;ve left out  <br/>
most of the original e-mail, trying to leave the main points that can  <br/>
apply to all kinds of situations, not just this particular family and  <br/>
incident.<br/>
<br/>
Before quoting my entire response, I&#39;m going to bring the most  <br/>
important part up top.  The quoted sections were from the e-mail that  <br/>
I received on the side.<br/>
<br/>
-=- My inclination, also,  is to ramp up our time together --  more  <br/>
of it, more exciting plans. Escalate the thrill of  things we do  <br/>
together with her friends, too, if she wants.  Offer  more structure  <br/>
(not top down kind, but plans), things to look forward to every day.   <br/>
-=--<br/>
<br/>
Good idea.  Good idea with our without problems.  All unschooling  <br/>
should be ramped up.<br/>
<br/>
======================================================================== <br/>
=================================<br/>
<br/>
-=-DD told me she shoplifted when she and her cousin went to the  <br/>
mall. -=-<br/>
<br/>
But she told you.<br/>
<br/>
-=-In the context of  radical unschooling principles and natural  <br/>
consequences for actions   . . . I&#39;m working to shift my perspective  <br/>
about this.  What are the natural consequences of stealing if you  <br/>
don&#39;t get caught? -=-<br/>
<br/>
It makes you a thief.  I shoplifted some when I was a teen.  I still  <br/>
feel guilty.  I didn&#39;t get caught.<br/>
It doesn&#39;t necessarily make you a thief for life.  I don&#39;t steal  <br/>
ANYthing from anybody, and haven&#39;t since I shoplifted a George  <br/>
Harrison 45 rpm record from Penney&#39;s at Winrock mall in Albuquerque  <br/>
in 1970.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the deal:  Had I been caught, I might&#39;ve been arrested, or  <br/>
maybe just scared straight by the mall security guys.<br/>
In your own case, you could be kept from unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
There have been many things my kids did that could have resulted in  <br/>
exposure to the county child welfare people.  I did NOT want to lose  <br/>
our right to unschooling, and it&#39;s fragile.  If a family is  <br/>
homeschooling and things aren&#39;t going great, a judge can easily say  <br/>
&quot;kids must go to school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=- I do feel a sense of broken trust, -=-<br/>
<br/>
She told you.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I understand it&#39;s not that uncommon for young people to push this  <br/>
boundary, mainstream parenting would probably say to march her into  <br/>
the store and pay for what she stole, apologize to the manager . . .  <br/>
sheesh.  I&#39;m not going to do that, it terms of dd and my  <br/>
relationship, that approach is  humiliating and punitive.-=-<br/>
<br/>
There are ways short of &quot;march her into the store&quot; that are not  <br/>
punitive, but can be healing and reparative.  You could take the  <br/>
things back yourself, or you could go and offer to pay for them and  <br/>
then take it out of her allowance, or get her to wash the car or  <br/>
something &quot;to earn money.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-But I don&#39;t really want to be around someone who steals.  Where as  <br/>
unschooling parents do our personal values end and our kids&#39; actions  <br/>
begin?  That may not be the right question.  I&#39;m coming into new  <br/>
challenges around my own boundaries as a grown up in this unschooling  <br/>
home.-=-<br/>
<br/>
You could tell her that calmly, though, that you don&#39;t want to be  <br/>
around thieves, and she probably doesn&#39;t want to *be&quot; a thief.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Some part of me wants to &quot;punish&quot; her.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
Then she&#39;ll stop telling you what she does.  She shared this with you  <br/>
and gave you a wonderful opportunity.  A disturbing opportunity, but  <br/>
a good one.<br/>
<br/>
-=-DD told me she shoplifted when she and her cousin went to the  <br/>
mall.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Have you spoken with the cousin?  Depending on personalities and  <br/>
relationships, that could be good or bad. It might make the cousin  <br/>
mad at your daughter.  That might be okay, if it would keep them from  <br/>
going out shoplifting more.  The cousin might encourage more  <br/>
sneakiness.   But if it were me and any of my kids&#39; actual cousins, I  <br/>
would stay directly to the cousin that it needs to stop, that if  <br/>
they&#39;re going to be breaking laws, it needs NOT to involve my kids,  <br/>
period.<br/>
<br/>
-=- My inclination, also,  is to ramp up our time together --  more  <br/>
of it, more exciting plans. Escalate the thrill of  things we do  <br/>
together with her friends, too, if she wants.  Offer  more structure  <br/>
(not top down kind, but plans), things to look forward to every day.   <br/>
-=--<br/>
<br/>
Good idea.  Good idea with our without problems.  All unschooling  <br/>
should be ramped up.<br/>
<br/>
-=- If you have time to offer any thoughts,  I&#39;d be grateful -- if  <br/>
it&#39;s appropriate for the forum I&#39;ll post it there.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll put my response on the list, and you can just watch the other  <br/>
comments or you can comment further yourself (with or without  <br/>
admitting the original situation was yours--you can stay totally  <br/>
anonymous if you want.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1807759941">I have a response to some of those questions.  Because the mom had  <br/>
been willing to send it to the list in the first place, I&#39;m sure she  <br/>
won&#39;t mind me sharing these, still anonymously.  This time the quotes  <br/>
are me.<br/>
<br/>
======================================================================== <br/>
=============================<br/>
<br/>
   She shared this with you and gave you a wonderful opportunity.  A  <br/>
disturbing opportunity, but a good one.<br/>
<br/>
Good point.  That&#39;s how it&#39;s evolving, really, as an opportunity.   <br/>
It&#39;s made me consider in my own mind, to myself, what constitutes  <br/>
&quot;stealing&quot;.  late taxes, delinquent bill paying, hmmm. alot of food  <br/>
for thought/not directly related to shoplifting, but connected.<br/>
<br/>
-=-DD told me she shoplifted when she and her cousin went to the  <br/>
mall.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Have you spoken with the cousin?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had no contact with the cousin since [she went home].    I&#39;m  <br/>
considering emailing her along the lines of what you suggested.   If  <br/>
she&#39;s going to choose to engage in illegal activities, please do it  <br/>
on her own.<br/>
<br/>
  -- but she told you.--<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  I&#39;m just beginning to appreciate the weight of this.  Now that  <br/>
I&#39;m not all full of my own reactivity and fear.<br/>
<br/>
-- doing something healing and reparative -- <br/>
<br/>
beautiful way to think about taking responsibility for an action that  <br/>
you don&#39;t feel that good about.<br/>
<br/>
thank you<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-958228608">A couple of years go, my then 9 yo Zoe, made some smart alek comment  <br/>
under  her breath in a dance class directed towards a dance teacher  <br/>
she didn&#39;t know well.  When we were on our way home from dance she  <br/>
told me about it and was feeling very regretful even though there&#39;d  <br/>
been no response from the teacher.  I suggested an apology might be in  <br/>
order and that Zoe would probably feel some better afterwards, so she  <br/>
agreed and asked me to turn the car around and head back so she could  <br/>
apologize.  The next class hadn&#39;t started yet and she was able to  <br/>
catch her teacher outside the dance studio and apologize.  I don&#39;t  <br/>
know if the teacher noticed the smart alek comment when dd said it,  <br/>
but she was very warm and forgiving when dd apologized.  The rest of  <br/>
the way home, Zoe felt relieved.<br/>
<br/>
Doing what we can to fix our own mistakes is some of the best healing  <br/>
that exists.<br/>

 <br/>
There&#39;s the possibility that telling her that could have the  daughter stop <br/>
telling the mom what she does. Some sort of &quot;fear of rejection&quot;  kind of thing? <br/>
I&#39;m not sure if that kind of thought comes from a  traditionally-parented <br/>
person or if it is more of a personality  thing.<br/>
