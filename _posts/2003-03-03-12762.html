<div id="ygrps-yiv-1153487052"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;PAM!  That was WONDERFUL!  Thank you.<br/>
&gt;You rock.<br/>
&gt;Tuck<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I second that Pam.  You ROCK!  (which is not to be<br/>
confused with Schoolhouse Rock, which, while cool, was<br/>
still &quot;Schoolhouse.&quot;)  As a poet myself, I appreciated<br/>
your response from a poetic standpoint, and found that<br/>
it flowed well and created just the right &quot;unschooley&quot;<br/>
(using that new word) feeling.  Can someone put that<br/>
up somewhere online?  Sandra?  Maybe Pam should send<br/>
it to HEM for all the folks who were visited (like a<br/>
haunting) by the original and were not graced by<br/>
experiencing this far superior rewrite.<br/>
