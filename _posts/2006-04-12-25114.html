Richard Johnston loves his kids. And about once a year or so he  <br/>
decides to prove it by embarrassing them in public.<br/>
<br/>
His most recent jibe at their expense appeared in the classified  <br/>
section of the Gazette-Times on April 1.<br/>
<br/>
Johnston and his wife, Nancy, dug up some 20-year-old photos of their  <br/>
grown children, Kathy Thompson and Tom Johnston, and pasted them into  <br/>
a bogus ad headlined �End Liberal Media Bias: Replace the GT Editor &  <br/>
Publisher with �The Basics.��<br/>
<br/>
The tongue-in-cheek advertisement went on to outline a reform  <br/>
platform by these �back to basics� journalistic crusaders:<br/>
<br/>
�They promise (a) censorship of editorials that favor gay rights,  <br/>
unschooling, Minnesota Vikings; (b) eliminating all comics except  <br/>
�Family Circus� and �BC�; (c) more columns by John Rosemond and Bill  <br/>
O�Reilly plus return of Mona Charen and James Dobson; (d) fewer anti- <br/>
war, pro-gay, feminist-leaning letters to the editor; (e) larger type.�<br/>
