to change and then come back?<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s true, it would have been cheaper for them to just shut down a little <br/>
while than to make new packaging and all that.  And if that were the case, <br/>
they could have advertised it and let people stock up, but it was a total <br/>
overnight surprise mess.<br/>
<br/>
What was said at the time was that they made it to be more like Pepsi, <br/>
because in the blind taste tests people really DID like Pepsi, and they <br/>
thought people would be happy.<br/>
<br/>
Keith used to drink a lot of coke in those days, but he hated the new stuff, <br/>
and he hates Pepsi.  <br/>
<br/>
For a long time New Coke and Classic Coke were available side by side, but I <br/>
think less than a year later, it was still called &quot;Classic Coke&quot; but the <br/>
other one was gone.  I doubt my kids know anything about it.<br/>
<br/>
It was a horrible fiasco, whatever it was.<br/>

This website doesn&#39;t mention a thing about a patent expiration but goes into the finer details of why new coke was made.<br/>

haven&#39;t been alive for 99 years? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve lived through the ends of lots of 99 year leases, though.  Much of my <br/>
hometown was leased from the neighboring pueblo, and they were unwilling to <br/>
lease again at the rates they&#39;d been happy with in the 1870&#39;s, in territorial <br/>
days.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Shutting down would have meant HUGE losses in sales. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Loss in sale of nothing, though.  They had a huge loss of sales with <br/>
manufactured and shipped product!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-947752743">Though it&#39;s already been well established that the patent-running-out theory<br/>
was bunk ;-) I just read in Uncle John&#39;s Bathroom Reader that the Coke<br/>
formula isn&#39;t even patented. He says that if something is patented when the<br/>
patent runs out then anyone can start producing it. (You have to reveal the<br/>
recipe or process in the patent.) So the formula for Coke is a company<br/>
secret.<br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t say anything about whether patents can be renewed or not. Though<br/>
I do know that Crest could only exclusively produce toothpaste with floride<br/>
in it for 17 (maybe?) years before all toothpaste companies could start<br/>
producing it. (Though maybe that only applies to formulas that are medical<br/>
in nature.)<br/>
<br/>
Oh, here&#39;s something in reply to someone asking about patent renewal:<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Patents cannot be renewed although US patents on drugs and certain<br/>
&gt; other products can be extended if the comerciallization of the<br/>
&gt; product was delayed by regulatory (in)action.  Unless so extended,<br/>
&gt; all US patents expire 17 years after issuance.  See 35 USC 154-156.<br/>
