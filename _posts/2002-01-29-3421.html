<div id="ygrps-yiv-128049805">To me an enriched environment means full of resources to satisfy passion.<br/>
 My passions are history, science and education so I make sure I have<br/>
what I need to satisfy them.  I have a television, cable channels,<br/>
internet access and I subscribe to email lists which discuss the topics I<br/>
find interesting.<br/>
<br/>
My children are passionate about many things; art, music, reading,<br/>
pretend, video games, etc.  I, out of a passion for them, try to provide<br/>
those things which satisfy them; art supplies, musical instruments, books<br/>
and frequent library visits, dress up costumes and props, video games and<br/>
consoles.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s so natural really, I love to see them not just happy but zealous;<br/>
excited about whatever they&#39;re doing.  For me, it&#39;s a no brainer, I<br/>
acquire those things that I can please them with and thus please myself;<br/>
a win-win situation.<br/>
