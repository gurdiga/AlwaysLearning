&lt;&lt; I really hate the idea of suing a place for an injury, but truly that ramp <br/>
 was bad.  Couldn&#39;t possibly be legally to code.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Down here, we have to build wheelchair ramps that drop at the rate of one <br/>
inch per foot.<br/>
In other words, if the ramp has to connect something that is 5 feet off the <br/>
ground, it can only drop one inch per foot of ramp, so the ramp is going to <br/>
be about SIXTY feet long!!...not a very steep slope at all.<br/>
That&#39;s why we often have to build a landing and make the ramp double back on <br/>
itself.<br/>
That ramp was definitely not dropping at one inch per foot, no way, no how.<br/>
I don&#39;t know what the codes are in SC, but I would bet money it wasn&#39;t up to <br/>
code. Wheelchair ramps are a hot issue with hotels.<br/>
<br/>
And here&#39;s a BIG BONUS!!! I didn&#39;t know this until right this minute, but <br/>
both my boys fell on that ramp during the conference.<br/>
They told me just now when my dh asked what I was writing about.<br/>
Jared fell and landed on his back.<br/>
Trevor said he landed on his butt. AND he fell into the door at a later time <br/>
because of all the wetness around the whole area.<br/>
So there&#39;s some witnesses for ya!<br/>

&lt;&lt;  Personally, if they are at fault they should at the bare minimum <br/>
 pay your expenses, and I wouldn&#39;t think worse of you for asking for <br/>
 more, for pain and suffering (surgery, missing the conference, etc.)  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
I had thought from the beginning they should reimburse SOS for any fees they <br/>
paid out to get you there.<br/>
They paid to get a speaker that they didn&#39;t have. I would talk to Kelly about <br/>
this, I&#39;m quite sure she&#39;s checking into it.<br/>

Also, in a humid climate, wouldn&#39;t wet indooroutdoor carpet quickly<br/>
become slimy indoor-outdoor carpet?<br/>

I think appropriate compensation for being couch-bound for weeks and not<br/>
being able to go places and do things is enough money to go wherever you<br/>
want and do whatever you want for the same number of weeks.  (Me, I&#39;m<br/>
thinking London, baby.)<br/>

I think that is happening, that they&#39;ll pay the airfare. <br/>
<br/>
The room was free.  I saw the receipt &quot;free&quot; on Tuesday before I left.  Not <br/>
that I ever slept there!! &lt;g&gt;  But Marty did.  If I&#39;d thought to think it <br/>
would be free, marty could&#39;ve had room service three times a day!  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Trust me, Marty didn&#39;t want room service 3 times a day! Or even once a day.<br/>
<br/>
But from what I heard Kelly was going to get his meals outside the hotel<br/>
covered by the hotel. We kept receipts and passed them on to her.<br/>
