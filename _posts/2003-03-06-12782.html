&lt;&lt; People in Saskatchewan were very friendly.  I had a way better time than I <br/>
 thought i would have.  I was afraid I&#39;d be all alone surrounded by <br/>
strangers, <br/>
 but it never felt that way from the moment I saw Ian and Barbie at the <br/>
 airport. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It all sounds wonderful.<br/>
Thanks for filling us in.  I know there are going to be lovely memories of <br/>
the SC conference this year too, I just KNOW it!<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
