<div id="ygrps-yiv-22686137">I see looking down at a PILE of e-mail that there&#39;s strife and  <br/>
bullshit on the list I haven&#39;t gotten to yet.  I&#39;ll get there.   But  <br/>
before that, some GOOD things:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://lyricsgame.blogspot.com/2009/05/umbrella-or-parasol.html">http://lyricsgame.blogspot.com/2009/05/umbrella-or-parasol.html</a><br/>
The lyrics game word is &quot;umbrella,&quot; and I worked in a picture of the  <br/>
Beatles and of Blake&#39;s Lotaburger.<br/>
<br/>
I have some site news here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com">http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com</a><br/>
and I did add those videos to my unschooling page, as some of you  <br/>
thought would be as good idea (and were persuasive; thanks).<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow Holly is going with Keith to Alamogordo.  She has the day  <br/>
off, and he will take a day.  His mother is dying.  She&#39;s 91 and has  <br/>
more than one cancer and had her arm amputated in early March, and his  <br/>
dad says she&#39;s not doing well.  When he called to talk to her on  <br/>
Mother&#39;s Day she was asleep and his dad says she sleeps nearly always  <br/>
and he should probably go and see her.   Holly and Marty were asked  <br/>
separately whether they wanted to go with him.   Holly immediately  <br/>
wanted to go.  Marty has one day off this week, Thursday, and has an  <br/>
ongoing role playing game that night, and a girlfriend, and he thought  <br/>
a while and opted out.<br/>
<br/>
The cool thing about all that is that no one was made to feel  <br/>
pressured or guilty.  &quot;Do you want to go with me to see grandma?&quot; was  <br/>
not a loaded question, nor a disguised requirement.   I opted out  <br/>
myself, and Keith was as sweet to me as if I&#39;d said I would go, and  <br/>
would have been the same either way.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s harder with newer, younger couples maybe.  It&#39;s impossible in  <br/>
some families for such a question and an occasion to honestly and  <br/>
truly be a respected choice.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When my dad was dying, Michelle (14) did not want to go to see him in  <br/>
the long-term care hospital. She is sensitive to emotions of others,  <br/>
easily upset, and I think she wanted to remember him in the good  <br/>
moments they spent together. The rest of my family went to see him,  <br/>
including me. Michelle stayed in the car.<br/>
<br/>
My sil really wanted to try to make Michelle feel guilty about this,  <br/>
but I wouldn&#39;t let her. Sil&#39;s done a lot of damage to her relationship  <br/>
with Michelle in the few times she&#39;s been with her. I understand her  <br/>
own sons&#39; desire to stay pretty far away from her, if they can.<br/>
<br/>
My mum (when she was alive) and my sister completely supported  <br/>
Michelle in her choice and were always sweet to her. I so appreciated  <br/>
that, as did Michelle.<br/>

<br/>
When my grandmother got cancer, I stayed with her a few months, and it <br/>
was great getting to know her more closely.  I had stayed with her a <br/>
while when I was 16 as well.   I also got to know my Grandpa Hoyle, who <br/>
my grandmother married after 8 years widowhood, and they had their 25th <br/>
anniversary while I was staying with her that 2nd time when she was <br/>
sick.  Getting to know them was a great thing for me, and Grandpa isn&#39;t <br/>
a blood relation but I would love it if he were.  He&#39;s been in a <br/>
nursing home for several years (needing round the clock care 24/7).  <br/>
Now he&#39;s 96 and my grandmother has been gone for 24 years.  I haven&#39;t <br/>
been to see him but I ask after him a lot.  I don&#39;t want to go visit.  <br/>
I saw him in person I think it was 2001 while he was still living on <br/>
his on.<br/>
<br/>
Like Michelle, I didn&#39;t want to remember Grandma dead in a casket or go <br/>
to her funeral, so my parents didn&#39;t make it a thing about it at all.  <br/>
I would say that had a lot to do with the fact that my dad found his <br/>
dad dead of a heart attack in the field.  He was a chicken and egg <br/>
farmer in the 40s.<br/>
<br/>
My parents weren&#39;t unschoolers.  So how how all this relates is that <br/>
unschoolers can respect the children choices in such important matters <br/>
on purpose.  And that&#39;s good.  :)<br/>
