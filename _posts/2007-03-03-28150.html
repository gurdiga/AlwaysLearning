<div id="ygrps-yiv-148459686">Okay, I thought I&#39;d posted on this board before, but apparently I just <br/>
read here.  So I wrote a post that&#39;s on moderation.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve posted on lots of unschooling boards so some people might <br/>
recognize me, but maybe not.  I know that I recognize a lot of names <br/>
here!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Jenny, I have 2 daughters, one is 5 and the other is 12</div>
