Do you want to name it, if not?<br/>
<br/>
I have it here and will add links about &quot;getting it&quot; and transitions to <br/>
unschooling, I think.<br/>

Anything you want to add to it?   Intro?   End note?   Links you want to have <br/>
there?<br/>

<br/>
Er..no.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Do you want to name it, if not?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well I just hadn&#39;t even thought about that. I rather like &quot;The Beautiful<br/>
Park&quot; and let the walking vs cycling part catch up to the reader later.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Anything you want to add to it?   Intro?   End note?   Links you want to<br/>
have <br/>
there?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure that any links I would think of, you already have in your<br/>
site. Maybe more people will come up with allegorical tales as time goes on.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m very flattered that you think it will be helpful. I guess I meant it as<br/>
an allegory of the experience of people joining our RU lists, as well as<br/>
being Unschoolers.<br/>

I figured it might be a good link to send to people who come on and want us <br/>
to change the lists to suit their expectations. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll put your name and probably change the name of the file too so they don&#39;t <br/>
get an advance clue.   I&#39;ll call it just &quot;park&quot; because it&#39;s shorter.<br/>

Done, and a heck of a set of links.   <br/>
<br/>
I messed with colors, got frustrated, and left it white.   If you have some <br/>
art or a photo you want in there I can do that.<br/>
