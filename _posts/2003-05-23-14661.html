thing was a lot of fun! (Well, at least for those of us who didn&#39;t slip and <br/>
fall and break our ankles and spend the whole conference in pain and <br/>
misery. I think only one of us did that and didn&#39;t have any fun.  The rest <br/>
of us...)<br/>
<br/>
Marji, who is really looking forward to an official count of how many <br/>
unschooling moms are named Kelly or Kelli  and Robin or Robyn and Pam, and <br/>
meeting them all. (Told ya I was tired! I crack really bad jokes when I&#39;m <br/>
tired.  It&#39;s kind of like a Tourette&#39;s syndrome or something, <br/>
uncontrollable bad-joke-cracking and pun-making. Maybe I should go back to <br/>
bed!e)</div>
