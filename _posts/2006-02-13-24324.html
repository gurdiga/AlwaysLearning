<div id="ygrps-yiv-1134616991">The Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago currently has a blockbuster <br/>
exhibit on the history and culture of video games - Game On. It looks like it&#39;s <br/>
going to be open through the end of April. Most of the exhibit is games to <br/>
play. It&#39;s pretty incredible. My kids and I went to the first incarnation last <br/>
year. Wow. I was amazed at how non chaotic and non overwhelming it was (I have a <br/>
hard time in arcades, too much competing stimulus.) It was wonderfully well <br/>
organized and there was so MUCH to do that we rarely had to wait long for a <br/>
desired spot. My 13yo daughter spent a very long time trying to get past the <br/>
opening sequence in the text adventure &quot;Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, without <br/>
success. She and her twin brother later teamed up to buy a collection of text <br/>
adventures from an ebay seller, and spent weeks playing Hitchhiker and Zork. :) <br/>
<br/>
Even if you can&#39;t make it to Chicago the online stuff is pretty cool, too.<br/>

Over the years video games have provided lots of learning for my kids, both <br/>
in and out of the game, particularly for my now 13yo son. For instance- he <br/>
started collecting older Nintendo systems, controllers, and games for the systems <br/>
a few years ago. He budgets for purchases, recalculating future expenditures <br/>
as he gains income or spots a new rare item for sale, or a changed price (the <br/>
used market being variable and unpredictable). He spends a lot of time doing <br/>
research on recent prices so he can recognize a good deal when he stumbles on <br/>
it. He&#39;s learned to base his ebay bids on what he wants to spend minus the <br/>
shipping and handling costs. He&#39;s learned to calculate which combination of wanted <br/>
used games will be the best bargain when Game Crazy has a buy two get one free <br/>
deal. He&#39;s done a HUGE amount of research to find information on these games <br/>
and systems that are in many cases older than he is, and all of which were new <br/>
to him. He reads online and read many books on older game systems. He got <br/>
really good at using our library computer catalog to order books in from the <br/>
regional system. He started with game guides and progressed through development <br/>
and history. Most recently he&#39;s been reading about game psychology and the <br/>
psychology of gaming, brain research and gaming, culture and gaming - he borrowed <br/>
&quot;Joystick Nation&quot; so many times I just bought him his own copy*. And of course <br/>
he wants to learn to program his own games.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t done any directing of his &quot;video game&quot; education. My job has been <br/>
helping as and when he needed it - helping him learn how to use the library <br/>
catalog and how to reserve materials; suggesting how to narrow searches on google <br/>
as well as the library systems; supplying transportation to video game <br/>
stores, garage sales, thrift stores and rummage sales; discussing with him potential <br/>
purchases when he asked my opinion; bidding on items for him from ebay (he <br/>
pays me when/if he wins the bid); gifting him with gaming magazines and books; <br/>
and most importantly having serious conversations with him about his serious <br/>
interest, where he gets to be the expert and I am an interested participant. Oh, <br/>
and I play with him, too. It&#39;s a real thrill when I win a competitive game <br/>
with him, it happens so rarely. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1406576567">There are 2 20th anniversary editions of the original text game (which<br/>
I couldn&#39;t ever get beyond getting the babelfish in my ear, but was<br/>
happy to find complete walkthroughs for when I tried sometime last<br/>
year) here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/hitchhikers/game.shtml">http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/hitchhikers/game.shtml</a><br/>
