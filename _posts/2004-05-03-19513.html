 <br/>
I am a new member from CT who has been lurking for a few days.<br/>

I have a 13 year old son who was in public school until just a few short weeks ago.<br/>

He has specifically asked me to teach him Chemistry. I know that he is very interested in the lab experiments as well as learning about it...

He is also interested in pottery. I ordered him a small wheel and some clay for him to play around with... It is on backorder, but I expect it in a couple of weeks, hopefully. I do not know anything really about pottery and could use some ideas of what I can do. I am not sure how big of an interest this will turn into, but he wants to try it and I am all for it. I just do not know what is available for him out there regarding pottery... I was hoping for maybe some pottery catalogs or websites that he can browse and see what interests him, or whatever...

cooking is wonderful chemistry.  Take your favorite cookie recipe and mess<br/>
with it.  Change ingredients and see what happens.<br/>
<br/>
Try to make your own paint---you can use milk and lime.<br/>
<br/>
Pottery---make some playdough with flour and salt (hey, its chemistry again)<br/>
and try making the different shapes.  Make a rope bowl, make a slab bowl.<br/>
<br/>
Do NOT sit around and wait for some kit to show up that tells you exactly<br/>
what to do, when and how.  Just mess with stuff, see what happens.  As Ms.<br/>

I have a friend, Kevin Dunn, who is a chemistry professor at Hampden-Sidney. <br/>
He has a great website. He&#39;s written a  book called _Caveman to Conjuror_. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-415465349">I thought your question was going to be about the excellent combination of <br/>
pottery and chemistry.  I think that&#39;s where you should start.  Fine online or <br/>
in books from the library books about the chemical composition of different <br/>
clays and why there are different &quot;cones&quot; (at what temperature does what clay <br/>
gain the maximum strength without becoming brittle, and why?  And why &quot;cones&quot;? <br/>
what are those cones?).<br/>
<br/>
And glazes!!! How and why does glaze stick to the clay in such a permanent <br/>
fashion?<br/>
<br/>
All a great intro to chemistry without being a school-style intro to <br/>
chemistry.<br/>

<br/>
Yes!  Types of clays, additives and glazes could keep a person busy for a<br/>
couple hundred years. <br/>
<br/>
Look for a pottery studio or co-op in your area.   Co-ops usually have an<br/>
affordable membership fee and then you have access to the studio and use<br/>
of the wheels and kiln.  And you can hang out with folks who love that<br/>
kind of thing and love talking about it too.  Sometimes they offer<br/>
classes or workshops but it can be more fun to just go hang out and play.<br/>
<br/>
If you have a local art club, call them and find out if their membership<br/>
includes a potter or ceramic artist.  Lots of those folks are available<br/>
to mentor beginners and would also have other ideas for you. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1232057194">Wow!  He is lucky--There is more chemistry in pottery<br/>
than he would ever get in highschool!  See if you can<br/>
find a pottery class through a studio or your local<br/>
community college....We all do pottery here and LOVE<br/>
it :) (I&#39;m not sure about the small wheel you ordered<br/>
him, but I have found that if it&#39;s not something a<br/>
&quot;professional&quot; would buy, but made for a child, it<br/>
proabaly will only be frustrating for him...When you<br/>
use a studio you get to use all their good wheels!)<br/>

Thank you for the suggestions.<br/>
 <br/>
My son does cook and really isn&#39;t interested in that. He wants the whole test tube and chemicals thing... He wants to learn the periodic table and be a scientist. At least that is his idea now.<br/>
 <br/>
If you re-read my post, I ordered some clay and a wheel for him to play around with... Not a kit with instructions. At 13 he is beyond the playdough phase... Been there, done that... He wants to shape it, bake it, and paint it.... His ideas, his designs, his way.<br/>
 <br/>
It was thoughtful of you to answer though, thank you.<br/>

 <br/>
Thank you for your suggestion and comments. I never thought of pottery as chemistry! <br/>
 <br/>
I checked out the local college and didn&#39;t see any type of pottery classes... I know that when I was younger I did ceramics, totally different but I have a point here lol!, and the classes were in really odd out of the way places. I wonder if there is a listing somewhere or a guide that may list these types of out of the way classes that may be available. I think he would prefer a class where he could do what he wanted with guidance on the basics; how to use the wheel and whatnot. I did do a google search and found nothing.<br/>
 <br/>
Any ideas?<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks again!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1739109921">Thank you for your suggestions, Sandra!<br/>
 <br/>
Like I said, I do not know anything about pottery. I had no idea that there were different clays or certain temperatures to needed bake them for strength.<br/>
 <br/>
Jordan is more of a hands on type, and probably wouldn&#39;t want to start with books, although once he starts he may naturally go in that direction. <br/>
 <br/>
Maybe a book or two is necessary, if pottery is so complex... I thought that maybe he could just play around with it and figure it out. I just did not know where to go to find classes or supplies or whatever.<br/>
 <br/>

I thought your question was going to be about the excellent combination of <br/>
pottery and chemistry.  I think that&#39;s where you should start.  Fine online or <br/>
in books from the library books about the chemical composition of different <br/>
clays and why there are different &quot;cones&quot; (at what temperature does what clay <br/>
gain the maximum strength without becoming brittle, and why?  And why &quot;cones&quot;? <br/>
what are those cones?).<br/>
<br/>
And glazes!!! How and why does glaze stick to the clay in such a permanent <br/>
fashion?<br/>
<br/>
All a great intro to chemistry without being a school-style intro to <br/>
chemistry.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-629773116">Look for a pottery studio or co-op in your area.   Co-ops usually have an<br/>
affordable membership fee and then you have access to the studio and use<br/>
of the wheels and kiln.  And you can hang out with folks who love that<br/>
kind of thing and love talking about it too.  Sometimes they offer<br/>
classes or workshops but it can be more fun to just go hang out and play.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One other thing to try.our local parks and Rec department for the city<br/>
offers a variety of pottery classes from preschool to adult levels.  They<br/>
are pretty open as far as what you do in class, and I think they also have<br/>
open studio use once they know you have a clue how to use the equipment.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1885987860">Do you have art galleries around you?  Or an art<br/>
museum?  I have a couple friends with art galleries,<br/>
and they have potters display all the time, and you<br/>
could get contact names that way?  There is an artists<br/>
co-op here as well, that my pottery teacher displayed<br/>
at....We also have an annual &quot;May Clay Day&quot; so that<br/>
kids and everyone can get a chance to play in clay and<br/>
meet artists.  Even hanging out at craft shows you can<br/>
meet potters.  Souvenier shops sometimes display<br/>
pottery by local artsts?  Also, try lookikng in the<br/>
phone book under &quot;art supplies,&quot;, and they may know of<br/>
local potters....Any of these people might be willing<br/>
to give classes, or will know someone who can...<br/>

Good luck!!<br/>

&gt; Thank you for your suggestion and comments. I never<br/>

&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I checked out the local college and didn&#39;t see any<br/>
&gt; type of pottery classes... I know that when I was<br/>
&gt; younger I did ceramics, totally different but I have<br/>
&gt; a point here lol!, and the classes were in really<br/>
&gt; odd out of the way places. I wonder if there is a<br/>
&gt; listing somewhere or a guide that may list these<br/>
&gt; types of out of the way classes that may be<br/>
&gt; available. I think he would prefer a class where he<br/>
&gt; could do what he wanted with guidance on the basics;<br/>
&gt; how to use the wheel and whatnot. I did do a google<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi there!<br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; I am a new member from CT who has been lurking for<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; few days.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; I have a 13 year old son who was in public school<br/>
&gt; &gt; until just a few short weeks ago.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; He has specifically asked me to teach him<br/>
&gt; Chemistry.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I know that he is very interested in the lab<br/>
&gt; &gt; experiments as well as learning about it... I have<br/>
&gt; &gt; been looking around to find something that would<br/>
&gt; be<br/>
&gt; &gt; interesting and have lots of experiments... I do<br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; &gt; have any friends or aquaintences in the field,<br/>
&gt; &gt; unfortunately. I am hoping that someone here has<br/>
&gt; &gt; some experience in learning Chemistry at home and<br/>
&gt; &gt; can give me some ideas.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; He is also interested in pottery. I ordered him a<br/>
&gt; &gt; small wheel and some clay for him to play around<br/>
&gt; &gt; with... It is on backorder, but I expect it in a<br/>
&gt; &gt; couple of weeks, hopefully. I do not know anything<br/>
&gt; &gt; really about pottery and could use some ideas of<br/>
&gt; &gt; what I can do. I am not sure how big of an<br/>
&gt; interest<br/>
&gt; &gt; this will turn into, but he wants to try it and I<br/>
&gt; am<br/>
&gt; &gt; all for it. I just do not know what is available<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt; him out there regarding pottery... I was hoping<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt; maybe some pottery catalogs or websites that he<br/>
&gt; can<br/>
&gt; &gt; browse and see what interests him, or whatever...<br/>
&gt; &gt; Like I said, I have no clue what is out there on<br/>
&gt; &gt; pottery, so I am not really sure what questions to<br/>
&gt; &gt; ask.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; Thank you very much.<br/>

Do you have art galleries around you?  Or an art<br/>
museum?  I have a couple friends with art galleries,<br/>
and they have potters display all the time, and you<br/>
could get contact names that way?  There is an artists<br/>
co-op here as well, that my pottery teacher displayed<br/>
at....We also have an annual &quot;May Clay Day&quot; so that<br/>
kids and everyone can get a chance to play in clay and<br/>
meet artists.  Even hanging out at craft shows you can<br/>
meet potters.  Souvenier shops sometimes display<br/>
pottery by local artsts?  Also, try lookikng in the<br/>
phone book under &quot;art supplies,&quot;, and they may know of<br/>
local potters....Any of these people might be willing<br/>
to give classes, or will know someone who can...<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!!<br/>

It&#39;s a self-learning &quot;hypertextbook&quot; you pay for online, download, and then <br/>
read from your computer.  It includes experiments that can be done at <br/>
home.  We felt it was well worth the money.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Maybe a book or two is necessary, if pottery is so complex... I thought <br/>
that maybe he could just play around with it and figure it out. &gt;&gt;<br/>

I took my Camp Fire club through a whole 6 weeks thing on pottery.  I knew <br/>
nothing about it when I started.  I did look in books on how to make pinch-pots. <br/>
 But basically what I did was buy a block of clay, set up the table, provide <br/>
some tools and have fun with it.  We went to see art in our community that was <br/>
made of clay, and a nice potter came and helped us work on some things.  <br/>
<br/>
It was interesting for me to learn how to use the tools and work with the <br/>
clay and the best way to prepare the work for firing, etc.  I had a willing group <br/>
who found it interesting because of my interest and the enthusiasm of the <br/>
potter, and they learned what they wanted to learn from it.  It wasn&#39;t <br/>
unschooling, exactly, but it was as close as I could get in the circumstances.  <br/>
<br/>
Just do it!  :)<br/>
