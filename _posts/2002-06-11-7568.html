How did  you realize you had this dream. Did you know someone who was a<br/>
falconer?<br/>
I&#39;m just curious.<br/>
<br/>
We recently had a wildlife bird organization come out to our last homeschool<br/>
group gathering and give us a fantastic &quot;show&quot; of the birds like hawks and<br/>
owls that they brought for us to see up close. Those birds are amazing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2078117753">This is interesting.  My girls and I have just finished listening to My Side of the <br/>
Mountain, The Other Side of the Mountain and Frightful&#39;s Mountain and they now dream <br/>
of being falconers.  Where do you get flacons and hawks?  I know it is a pretty strict <br/>
licencing schedule for it all.  <br/>
<br/>
What state do you live in?<br/>
