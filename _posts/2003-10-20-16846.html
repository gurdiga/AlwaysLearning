<div id="ygrps-yiv-1963396859">As many of you know, I&#39;m the editor of the Making it Work section of the <br/>
La Leche League New Beginnings Magazine.  I need some help, and thought <br/>
a few of you could help...If some of you could please write a bit, I&#39;d <br/>
appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>
The situation:  My baby statys with a very breastfeeding-friendly <br/>
caregiver while I work.  She&#39;s been wonderful about feeding and caring <br/>
for my baby the way I want her to.  She has other children in her care, <br/>
however, and yesterday a toddler bit my baby!  I&#39;m upset and worried now <br/>
about my baby&#39;s safety--but I know it would be hard to find another <br/>
caregiver who is so loving and willing to feed my pumped milk.  What <br/>
have other mothers done when things like this happen?<br/>
<br/>
If you could just write a paragraph or two (or three) about this <br/>
situation I&#39;d appreciate it. <br/>
<br/>
