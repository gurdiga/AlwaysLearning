&gt; didn&#39;t allow you guys to call <br/>
&gt; him *bad* back then, I haven&#39;t allowed anyone to<br/>
&gt; call him that for his whole <br/>

myself needing to use your words in my son&#39;s future!<br/>

doesn&#39;t &quot;behave&quot; like he&#39;s &quot;supposed to&quot; according to<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-559471463"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; -=-<br/>
&gt;    Could someone give me some advice on where to<br/>
&gt; start with the  <br/>
&gt; unschooling approach.  Or is it too late because of<br/>
&gt; the ages of my  <br/>
&gt; two older kids and the damage that has been done?-=-<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would encourage you not to think of it as &quot;damage.&quot;<br/>
we are hard enough on ourselves as mothers without the<br/>
extra baggage created by feelings of hopelessness,<br/>
making it even more difficult to manifest change.<br/>
think of it as experience which will allow your kids<br/>
to understand what many of their peers have been<br/>
subjected to (which is exactly what it is). getting to<br/>
taste both worlds will inform their lives from here<br/>
forward, influencing their thinking and their own<br/>
choices.<br/>
<br/>
deschooling, like any psychological or behavioral<br/>
change, is a process. love yourself and your family as<br/>
you move through this exciting and freeing change!<br/>
undoing conditioned behavior takes time. being gentle<br/>
with yourself and allowing yourself and your family to<br/>
change slowly will create the space needed for the<br/>
changes to settle on you and become permanent.<br/>
<br/>
you will find your way! enjoy the journey!<br/>
Julia, finding her own way right along with you :)</div>
