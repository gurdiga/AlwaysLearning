<div id="ygrps-yiv-1351353850">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;He has a long coat, but it&#39;s not really huge, but<br/>
for $100 we can&#39;t spend much on props and<br/>
costumes.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Try Goodwill, Sally Army, etc.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;We can find a pink umbrella, I figure, but do any<br/>
of you have suggestions for aging it?  I was thinking<br/>
generally scuffing it with sandpaper and <br/>
maybe spraying mud on it and then rinsing it off.  It<br/>
can&#39;t look new and WalMartish.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Go easy on the sandpaper! It should work just as well<br/>
to get a pair of shoes (the bottoms) muddy and rub<br/>
them firmly on the umbrella then rinse. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;What Monty Python sketches are specifically<br/>
Yorkshire besides &quot;Every Sperm is Sacred&quot;?  If we had<br/>
our friend Helena here who&#39;s lived in and around York<br/>
for the past two years, she could coach him, but she&#39;s<br/>
in London,  probably losing her edge.<br/>

I would bet that most of the kids couldn&#39;t tell the<br/>
difference between a Yorkshire accent and another<br/>
heavy English dialect (like London, Manchester,<br/>
Newcastle, etc.). Most americans can&#39;t seem to pick<br/>
out particular accents of the Brits. I bet he&#39;ll be<br/>
able to wing it fine!<br/>
