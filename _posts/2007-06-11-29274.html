Maybe, if he is friends with people at the gaming shop or other place, they<br/>
might have him come in for a few hours here and there to help out.<br/>

<br/>
Depends on the state, but most places you pretty much have to be 15  <br/>
or 16.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby was offered the job because he had volunteered to help, lots,  <br/>
at the shop where he was hanging out.<br/>
Another friend of his who was there and said he was NEVER going to  <br/>
work for free ended up going years without having a job.  Kirby, who  <br/>
was working because the work needed to be done and he was capable and  <br/>
present, has worked now for seven years.<br/>
<br/>
Had Kirby asked for a job, I don&#39;t think he would have gotten one.<br/>
<br/>
Marty was offered his first job, too. He was 15.   Being out and  <br/>
about, being helpful, being interested in things, is what got them  <br/>
opportunities, and sometimes volunteer opportunities, but earning  <br/>
people&#39;s trust and confidence, and gaining experience, are important.<br/>
