<div id="ygrps-yiv-1818284202">Thank you everyone - I am always learning! I have appreciated the mails and<br/>
am implementing my learning as fast as I can. But I can&#39;t keep up with the<br/>
volume of mails here, read John Holt, look after my baby and assist our<br/>
family in its paradigm shift into unschooling - there just aren&#39;t enough<br/>
hours in my day. I hadn&#39;t had a chance to read for a week and to my dismay<br/>
found over 1000 mails waiting from you communicative lot!!! So, I&#39;ve read as<br/>
fast as possible for 2 hours, and am now saying goodby for the time being.<br/>
No doubt I will be back one of these days - I am now completely convinced<br/>
about the validity of unschooling.<br/>
Blessings<br/>
