on there: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/being">http://sandradodd.com/being</a> which is very much related.<br/>
<br/>
I see glimpses of Marina&#39;s experiences between Karl and us, and I think the<br/>
more we respect Karl, the more he will reciprocate.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1457318783">The funny thing is when my dh John went to bed he commented on how cute it<br/>
was Rowan and I were hanging out on a Saturday night.  That&#39;s when I<br/>
realized the meaning behind those smiles and vague comments from moms with<br/>
younger kids going past us.<br/>
<br/>
John also gave us the space to be together, telling us to enjoy our videos.<br/>
If your spouse competes with the kids for your attention or with you for<br/>
their attention--unschooling and family relationships in general won&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
John got nostalgic for when Rowan was three or so, and he actually drew the<br/>
parallel about how our relationship with our son started with all the<br/>
power/responsibility on the adult side and all the love, respect, and<br/>
patience flowing to our son.  Now, he is seeing flow both ways, and with our<br/>
two younger kids at a sleepover, John was able to celebrate the journey.  I<br/>
was too busy hanging out with Rowan in the moment to see any of it on<br/>
Saturday night:) He reflected on what an amazing kid Rowan is and what an<br/>
amazing patient open-minded man he is growing up to become.  The next<br/>
morning he was talking to me about how wonderful it was to hear Rowan and I<br/>
chatting and laughing.<br/>
<br/>
We ended up watching Abbot and Costello shorts on youtube and some cartoons.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I realized how quickly time flies and just how happy I am I didn&#39;t listen to<br/>
naysayers, but instead listened to my son and my instinct.  The thing about<br/>
being an unschooling family is none of it was &quot;strange&quot; to me, and it wasn&#39;t<br/>
until later on that I realized why it might seem so odd to others.  It seems<br/>
so sad that a mom and her teenager eating, laughing and watching a movie<br/>
should be so unusual.<br/>
