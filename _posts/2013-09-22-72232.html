<div id="ygrps-yiv-813295468"><div dir="ltr">I stayed stressed out.  I was shy and from kindergarten throughout I spent most of my time worrying.  I think I may have had some kind of social anxiety as early as kindergarten.  That is 12 years of stress and Im just now realizing how much stress I was under.  Anyone else?<br>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-876931918"><p>There&#39;s evidence that introverts are more prone to depression (lots, going all the way back to Jung). Introverts also can find school challenging in a number of ways - between the over-abundance of people and the need to change activities at far shorter intervals than is comfortable. And introverts can have a harder time socializing in schools because they don&#39;t have the ability to observe social situations comfortably from a difference. So while being an introvert may have made you more likely to become depressed, you were also in an environment which would have exacerbated that tendency enormously.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">---Meredith</p> <div class="ygrps-yiv-876931918ygroups-quoted"><br><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> --- In AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com, &lt;alwayslearning@yahoogroups.com&gt; wrote:<br><br><div id="ygrps-yiv-876931918ygrps-yiv-1874373496"><div id="ygrps-yiv-876931918ygrps-yiv-1874373496ygrps-yiv-357719228"><div dir="ltr"><div>I should also say that by the time I was 16 I was into drugs.� By 21 I was hospitalized for depression/ocd and put on disability for it.� Im still sorting it all out... :(� Im 35 now and I have four kids.� The oldest is 12 and he began staying at home in 3rd grade.� My three girls have always been home.� I started a home business 6 years ago and we have all been able to stay home.� <br>
