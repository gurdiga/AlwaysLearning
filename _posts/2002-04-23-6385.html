<div id="ygrps-yiv-1374258439">I just had one of those great learning experiences with my son yesterday<br/>
morning and would like to share.<br/>
<br/>
This past week we have been working on a dance concert. I was designing the<br/>
lighting and Jocelyn was designing costumes. One of the pieces used the song<br/>
&quot;We Didn&#39;t Start the Fire &quot; by Billy Joel.  It was not much of a dance,  but<br/>
the soundtrack was intriguing.   The piece had a live band.  The first<br/>
rehearsal Jocelyn saw it was with just the band, nobody singing the lyrics.<br/>
This is this the song where Joel lists major events and people from the<br/>
fifties to the late &#39;80s in rapid-fire.  So without a singer and with pretty<br/>
ho-hum choreography, it was pretty dull.  The next rehearsal Jocelyn saw was<br/>
with the singer and she found it far more interesting.  She wasn&#39;t familiar<br/>
with the song so she did some research on the Internet and came up with<br/>
these two links.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The first one is to a site some teachers in Springfield Illinois put<br/>
together. It contains a QuickTime video that flashes pictures of all the<br/>
events in rhythm to the lyrics.  The second site lists all the lyrics and<br/>
has links in the lyrics to various sites that give you information on the<br/>
subject of the lyric.<br/>
So there I was watching this video, several times, and being amazed at much<br/>
more I was getting out of it each time I viewed it with the visuals.  I was<br/>
looking at the linked site clicking on names I wasn&#39;t familiar with.  I was<br/>
picking up facts about Santayana and a Prokhorov.  Then my son Matthew<br/>
walked in.  He had been to a rehearsal or two and had seen the dance. I<br/>
asked him if he&#39;d seen the video and he said his mother had showed it to him<br/>
the day before. He asked what I was doing and I showed him the link site and<br/>
how cool it was to instantly go to information about the song lyrics. In a<br/>
flash he sat down next to me and we were quickly clicking to information<br/>
about Peyton Place and Princess Grace and Khrushchev and Dien Bien Phu and<br/>
Josef Stalin and Bernie Goetz.  He particularly liked the the link to<br/>
Liberace and &quot; crying all the way to the bank.&quot; We then discussed the<br/>
possibility of visiting the Liberace museum next time we were anywhere near<br/>
Las Vegas.<br/>
<br/>
So there we were, reaching for an abbreviated history of the last half of<br/>
the 20th-century with a decade-old popular tune and a Web browser.<br/>
Jocelyn had a drive to learn more about this popular tune that she couldn&#39;t<br/>
believe she hadn&#39;t known about. I was captivated that adding the visual<br/>
element to the lyrics made them far more recognizable to me. Matthew was<br/>
impressed at the depth to each of the historical elements that were just<br/>
words in a song, and tickled at how quickly we had access to it all.<br/>
<br/>
Then, in one of those grand coincidences, we were watching the Simpsons last<br/>
night and the tag to the clip show that was aired was a parody of this song!<br/>
<br/>
This &quot;always learning&quot; talk makes so much sense.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-233675303">Dan, thanks for some great sites! I&#39;ve already passed them on. Why did the<br/>
movie make me cry, though? (That&#39;s rhetorical, BTW!)<br/>
<br/>
Karen<br/>
Saw Billy Joel in concert twice, &#39;78, and &#39;95 with Elton John: wonderful!<br/>
