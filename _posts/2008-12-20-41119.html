I thought some of you might have kids who are restless and could use  <br/>
a new hobby.  I saw this advertised on Neopets.  It says &quot;Habbo-- <br/>
hangout for teens&quot; and it seems one registers for free, creates an  <br/>
icon that looks like a Lego person, and it looks like they can have  <br/>
text conversations with other players.<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, I don&#39;t know.  Holly, my youngest, is already using  <br/>
MySpace as her virtual world (and many of her real-life friends keep  <br/>
in touch with her there), but this looks simpler and cute.  I haven&#39;t  <br/>
been in there and so can&#39;t vouch for it, but the week before  <br/>
Christmas can sometimes use more things for kids to do.<br/>
