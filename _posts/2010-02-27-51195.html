<div id="ygrps-yiv-873826419">&lt;&lt;Will the powder from the chalk be all over the carpet?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We have an indoor cement wall (in Kiba&#39;s craft area) that we painted and <br/>
turned into an indoor rock climbing wall.  She chose to make the wall into a <br/>
drawing center also.  So, we&#39;ve got a painted, chalk writing, rock climbing <br/>
wall. &lt;g&gt;  In our situation (cement wall), the chalk does puddle at the <br/>
bottom of wall.  However, we use (okay, Dave uses) the vacuum attachment to <br/>
just suck it up.<br/>

That sounds lots of fun: rock climbing and drawing center!<br/>
