 </span></blockquote>Hi Alyssa,<br/>
I&#39;m so glad you mentioned Net Nanny, I&#39;ve heard of it before but then forgot <br/>
all about it. I just googled it and saw that I can order it on line for 39.95, <br/>
is this a one time fee or a monthly thing? Can I buy this at a store or do I <br/>
need to dl it from the computer? The parental blocks on our computer are so <br/>
lame, they don&#39;t let the kids go any where. Our daughters are 11 & 12 and I <br/>
really don&#39;t like the idea of something like porn popping up in their face but yet <br/>
I also hate how the parental controls limit them so much. <br/>
Thanks for any info you have for me!<br/>
Nancy<br/>

We Holly flagged as her real age when we were in AOL, and found she  <br/>
couldn&#39;t even get to her own webpage.<br/>

<br/>
Computer blocking programs, their costs, etc., isn&#39;t a good topic for  <br/>
this list.  Read their webpages, call their salesmen (they DO want to  <br/>
sell you something), but first consider this free advice:    Don&#39;t  <br/>
limit your children&#39;s freedom.  Find ways to communicate and trust  <br/>
one another instead of making rules and paying money for electronic  <br/>
fences.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t made of a big bunch of &quot;no.&quot;<br/>
