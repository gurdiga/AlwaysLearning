Several  times the <br/>
book has gotten closed without her place being marked. So -  maybe we <br/>
should limit the length of books she is allowed to read, because  she <br/>
really does so &quot;over&quot; react when she loses her place - it is such a  <br/>
terrible source of frustration for her!  &lt;BEG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
===========<br/>
 <br/>
You could require her to read to the end of a chapter, or lose her reading  <br/>
privileges.<br/>
 <br/>
You could take the book away from her for a week if she whimpers or cries  <br/>
about losing her place.<br/>
 <br/>
But limiting her to very small books she can read in one sitting seems to  <br/>
solve the frustration problem in the traditional fashion. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
How about telling her 15, 10 and 5 minutes in advance when she&#39;ll have to<br/>
stop reading. Then Remind her to put her book mark in.  &quot;No more reading<br/>
today, you have had enough.&quot;</div>

That would be a heck of a lot better than what some parents do about video <br/>
games, which is to say &quot;Turn it off NOW,&quot; or what some parents do about TV or <br/>
movies which is just turn turn the TV off without advance notice.<br/>
