<div id="ygrps-yiv-51690911">Hi All:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had to delete tons of e-mails lately as I&#39;ve been so overwhelmed with<br/>
&quot;stuff&quot; going on.... I&#39;ve tried to keep up with what&#39;s going on but have<br/>
failed miserably.... Good job I&#39;m not being tested on whether I read every<br/>
e-mail.<br/>
<br/>
Shyrly in UAE (?).... I&#39;m looking for the same place that you are and<br/>
currently live in the desert of Tucson... Must be something wrong with us<br/>
British women who marry Americans who then cart us off to places which will<br/>
destroy our beautiful english rose skin (LOL)....<br/>
<br/>
We are looking at Northern California and have narrowed it down to somewhere<br/>
between Sacramento and Redding (to start with)... I know it&#39;s hot there in<br/>
the summer, but not hot compared to 5 months of over 100 degrees like<br/>
Tucson.  I feel like I&#39;m going to be made into a leather handbag anyday<br/>
now... I don&#39;t even lay out in the sun and I&#39;m sun tanned....<br/>
<br/>
One of my friends was telling me about a book she&#39;s reading about how to<br/>
help her kids (ages 6 and 7) with their homework and I was saying nothing<br/>
(this is new for me to keep my mouth shut)... After a few minutes of me not<br/>
commenting she said &quot;you&#39;re not saying anything&quot;... I asked &quot;what would you<br/>
like me to say?&quot;  &quot;don&#39;t you have a comment, you usually do&quot;... &quot;Nope&quot;.....<br/>
And then I couldn&#39;t resist as she was pushing me so I said &quot;if you prefer to<br/>
spend your time reading books on how to get your kids to do homework, rather<br/>
than just spending time with your kids, that&#39;s up to you&quot;..... &quot;Oh&quot;  was the<br/>
response.... Next time I don&#39;t think she&#39;ll ask....<br/>
<br/>
I was doing so well with keeping my mouth shut.  I guess practice makes<br/>
perfect.....<br/>
<br/>
DH is planning on quitting his job at the end of August to stay home full<br/>
time with the kids and let me turn my business into a &quot;real&quot; full time<br/>
career that will support us.  I&#39;m sure this is going to be a transition and<br/>
we&#39;ll be fine.  The boys are really looking forward to it.  DH has started<br/>
to take off time from work so we all get used to the idea and he gets to go<br/>
on more field trips...<br/>
<br/>
So we are deliberating whether to move to Northern California and have DH<br/>
quit his job at the same time.  I hear they are 2 of the most stressful<br/>
things... One good part would be we get them both over with all at once...<br/>
<br/>
Just some meanderings to get me back in the loop.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing... Someone sent me a link to an unschooling magazine.  Many of<br/>
you probably already subscribe but if not I thought I&#39;d pass it on.  It&#39;s<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.lifelearningmagazine.com/">http://www.lifelearningmagazine.com/</a> I had a wonderful conversation with the<br/>
editor who unschooled her kids from the beginning and they are now 28 and<br/>
30.  It was wonderful to hear her talk of what they are up to now and the<br/>
journey she took.<br/>
<br/>
Catch you later.<br/>
<br/>
Dawn<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1333089106">When I was 13, 14, & 15, we lived in Mapleton, Oregon.<br/>
 About 20 or so miles from the Pacific Ocean, on the<br/>
Siuslaw River.  One hour from Eugene.  Giant licorice<br/>
ferns, WONDERFUL boison berries, hills, moutains,<br/>
trees, mud slides (in forest denuded areas), rocks,<br/>
near 100% humidity all the time, wild<br/>
rhododendrons....  No big rain drops, no thunder,no<br/>
lightening, no tornadoes, no poisonous snakes.  It was<br/>
ethereal and damp, misty, swirling lavender and grey. <br/>
I walked in the forests always, lived in the trees,<br/>
made a wickiup from my brother&#39;s and me..... <br/>
<br/>
Lumber was the ONLY industry (my step-father was a<br/>
civil engineer for USFS....we had a bit more fortunate<br/>
standard of living than most of the locals) The 4 <br/>
year high school had 200 students. 100 freshmen, 50<br/>
sophomores, 30 juniors, and 20 seniors of which 10<br/>
would usually graduate.  At school pep rallies they<br/>
had noise contests....the boys brought chain saws to<br/>
school to make lots of noise. <br/>
<br/>
It was too wet for mosquitoes most of the time. And<br/>
even I had  a little bit of curl in my hair. No snow<br/>
in the yard, but there was snow about an hour away.<br/>
Hot mineral springs for bathing a half hour away in<br/>
the other direction. Clear, pristine springs for<br/>
drinking water were above our house. We swam in the<br/>
river.  There was a covered bridge across the river.  <br/>
<br/>
My mother HATED this area.  She added to her<br/>
addictions prescription barbiturates while here.  But<br/>
if you like the beautiful  swirling foggy misty<br/>
magical rain forest  that would be the spot.  Watch<br/>
out for falling rock on the highway between Eugene and<br/>
the coast.   <br/>
<br/>
Most people living there (on the Siuslaw)had a low<br/>
income, so cost of living is low, too.<br/>
<br/>
Of course it has been almost 40 years since I&#39;ve been<br/>
there. <br/>
<br/>
Cave Junction has (had?) a surprisingly open minded<br/>
local population of grown-up hippies. One of my little<br/>
brothers bought property there and built an off the<br/>
grid giant log home which he has since sold (for<br/>
reasons other than the being happy there)and moved<br/>
back to FL.  But he said there was lots of social,<br/>
emotional, and actual physical support and sharing of<br/>
labor, ideas, and resources. <br/>
<br/>
Just some nostalgia for the ethereal. But do watch out<br/>
for bears while picking berries.<br/>
