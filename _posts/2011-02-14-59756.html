<div id="ygrps-yiv-1795886289">I wrote this in response to an offlist email. Every once in a while  <br/>
Sandra gets accused of limiting people&#39;s thoughts when an idea is  <br/>
turned away or pointed out as not unschooling enough.<br/>
<br/>
Limiting is good because it keeps the list focused which means less to  <br/>
wade through. (That&#39;s important.) And Always Learning doesn&#39;t deny  <br/>
people the right to search beyond the list. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
While practical, it felt there was something more important those  <br/>
explanations didn&#39;t get at. So maybe this helps. Or maybe it just  <br/>
helps me see it better ;-)<br/>
<br/>
============<br/>
<br/>
Think of the list as like a Zen center.  It&#39;s a place where people  <br/>
interested in learning Zen can shut off *for a short time* everything  <br/>
else they know and immerse themselves in an atmosphere that&#39;s pure Zen  <br/>
in order to become better at Zen practices. For the hour or so that  <br/>
they&#39;re at the center, they can live and breathe Zen. At first their  <br/>
practice won&#39;t be very good. But because the atmosphere is  <br/>
deliberately limited to Zen, they&#39;ll find it easier and easier to let  <br/>
go of thoughts and habits that aren&#39;t Zen. They&#39;ll find it easier and  <br/>
easier to make Zen choices.<br/>
<br/>
The goal of the deliberately limited world of the Zen center is not to  <br/>
become people&#39;s entire world. It is deliberately, purposely limited  <br/>
and *offered* as a temporary retreat that people can *choose* to visit  <br/>
to grow their new understanding.<br/>
<br/>
But bringing non-Zen ideas into the center destroys the Zen space.  <br/>
People don&#39;t need another non-Zen place to practice Zen. They already  <br/>
have the non-Zen world they will return to when they leave the center.<br/>
<br/>
I do understand that you believe what you offered is compatible with  <br/>
unschooling, that an unschooler can use it in unschooling ways.<br/>
<br/>
Well, a great variety of conventional things can be used by  <br/>
unschoolers in unschooling ways. But before someone fully grasps  <br/>
unschooling, they not only can&#39;t use them in unschooling ways, but  <br/>
offering these things as unschooling tools will create a tangled knot  <br/>
in their growing understanding.<br/>
<br/>
An example would be: Some always unschooled kids enjoy workbooks.  <br/>
There&#39;s no unschooling &quot;rule&quot; against kids using workbooks. But until  <br/>
someone grasps how learning happens through living, it will be a huge  <br/>
help to a new person&#39;s growing understanding to avoid workbooks. The  <br/>
workbooks will hamper their seeing how much better the chaos of  <br/>
natural learning is. People suggesting workbooks will hamper their  <br/>
understanding. They&#39;ll keep looking at natural learning through school  <br/>
colored glasses.<br/>
<br/>
The Always Learning list is a &quot;Zen center&quot; for unschooling. It&#39;s a  <br/>
place to retreat from seeing certain conventional solutions as a first  <br/>
choice. It&#39;s a place to experience pure unschooling thinking in  <br/>
action. It&#39;s a place to see what &quot;supporting a child&#39;s explorations as  <br/>
a way for the child to grow his own understanding of himself and the  <br/>
world&quot; looks like when it becomes one of the primary tools for living  <br/>
with kids.<br/>
<br/>
Until someone has had loads of opportunities to exclusively see  <br/>
unschooling in practice and then try out and finally trust the  <br/>
unschooling principles, they won&#39;t be able to see experts as tools.  <br/>
They can only see experts as people better equipped than &quot;just&quot; a mom  <br/>
to tackle a child&#39;s problem.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-987082777">I liked all of what Joyce wrote - nice comparison. The only quibble I <br/>
would have is that people go to a Zen center to practice Zen, but this <br/>
list is to talk about unschooling, not practice it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; There&#39;s no unschooling &quot;rule&quot; against kids using workbooks.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  The wording struck me funny, to say &quot;using&quot; workbooks. We wouldn&#39;t say <br/>
&quot;using&quot; a Sudoku book or &quot;using&quot; a crossword puzzle. We&#39;d saying <br/>
&quot;doing,&quot; maybe. And, as I thought about it, I realized that my kids <br/>
would never have said &quot;using,&quot; they&#39;d have more likely saying &quot;playing <br/>
with.&quot; But - as I thought about it more - I don&#39;t think my kids knew to <br/>
call a workbook a workbook. Rosie had a lot of them - she liked them. <br/>
But she called each of them by their title or used a description. She <br/>
didn&#39;t even recognize that there was a whole category known as <br/>
&quot;workbooks,&quot; until she was probably 10 or so. She probably just thought <br/>
of them as another kind of book.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1537460747">Talking of Zen center is a really a cool way to explain this. The center is<br/>
very important. Once one takes care of the center and cleanses it of all<br/>
&#39;clutter&#39;, the right periphery also settles. It is a patient process. To get<br/>
stuck at the periphery can never bring about noticeable and significant<br/>
transformation. Simply because the periphery is never in control. But to<br/>
control the center is absolutely possible though tough and surely and<br/>
certainly the only door to transformation.<br/>
<br/>
I do feel Sandra does not limit the thoughts she simply helps to de-clutter<br/>
(if there is any such word).<br/>
