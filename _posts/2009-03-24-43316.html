<div id="ygrps-yiv-2057885255">A new member wrote &quot;I am so glad I joined this group!! It seems that  <br/>
everything<br/>
that is a concern that crosses my mind turns up as question<br/>
on this group.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has questions they&#39;re shy to ask, you could search the  <br/>
archives of this group by clicking at the bottom of any of the group e- <br/>
mails, where it says messages and searching.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s even easier and might take less time reading is this:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/search">http://sandradodd.com/search</a><br/>
<br/>
or go to Joyce&#39;s page<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://joyfullyrejoycing.com">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com</a><br/>
or<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Those sites have &quot;best of&quot; unschooling writings collected from over  <br/>
many years.<br/>
<br/>
This Wednesday there will be a chat on that time when unschooled kids  <br/>
get older, and think about leaving home, or go.  How the parents  <br/>
handle that time of life is different for unschoolers, too.<br/>
