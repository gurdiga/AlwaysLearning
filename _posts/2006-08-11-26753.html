some way to try to out the woman for repeating a lie.<br/>

<br/>
The buying and selling of horses has deeper legal roots than probably  <br/>
anything but marriage and child custody.  It&#39;s BIGtime, isn&#39;t it?   <br/>
It&#39;s not something people should be lying about at all.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if nothing else, a lawsuit asking a judge to keep her from  <br/>
selling horses would be helpful.  Maybe too expensive to pursue and  <br/>
too stressful for you, but maybe there&#39;s a horse-involved lawyer who  <br/>
might take it on as his own project, and do it without your direct  <br/>
involvement.<br/>
<br/>
Seems a shame to let her get off with ONLY a confrontation by a  <br/>
strong girl and some letters.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-494696373">Re: the question about the history of toys.<br/>
<br/>
In studying ancient civilizations last year, I came upon information about<br/>
toy artifacts in ancient India and Egypt. It&#39;s escaped me now the<br/>
details...I&#39;ll look for some links. But the fact that toys were around then<br/>
stayed with me because it showed that people/children were enriched with<br/>
them back then, and toys aren&#39;t something new and/or deviant to living.<br/>
There certainly may be an element today of profit that drives production of<br/>
toys, but it seems the initial desire to have fun things comes from humans<br/>
(and well, dogs, cats and monkeys too).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>with ONLY a confrontation by a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;strong girl and some letters.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Angela, I just wanted to share a story that just happened to me. I was sued<br/>
by a drug company for $83,000. I was sued because my husband was employed as<br/>
a doctor at a clinic that didn&#39;t pay their pharmacy bill. He had nothing to<br/>
do with it. I had nothing to do with it. But it didn&#39;t stop us from being<br/>
named in the suit. We live in a community property state, which is why I was<br/>
named as well.<br/>
<br/>
This law suit was bogus from the start. I do not like controversy, similar<br/>
to you. But I had no choice about this. If I didn&#39;t do anything about it,<br/>
they win, take whatever they can from me. I was forced to go beyond my<br/>
comfort zone.<br/>
<br/>
We lived a pretty simple and uncomplicated life in a small town in Ohio for<br/>
12 years. We moved to a more metropolitan area (Phoenix) 4 years ago, which<br/>
is when we realized that some people really DO make money and power their<br/>
priority. Will lie and cheat and steal to get it. Seems obvious, but we had<br/>
never seen it upclose before irl.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have much to take from, all the more reason to fight to keep it. Dh<br/>
only practices medicine that makes sense, not the kind that makes drug<br/>
companies billions. This means he doesn&#39;t make what many doctors are thought<br/>
to make moneywise.<br/>
<br/>
So we took on this drug company with help here and there from an atty when<br/>
we could afford it, and from a friend who is a paralegal, and I researched<br/>
how to legally respond to court documents and I prepared Statements of<br/>
Facts, Motions, Affidavits, etc. I HATED it and at that same time I enjoyed<br/>
it. I was doing something for personal justice, and I was learning about a<br/>
system that is a large part of our society. In the end, I got the case<br/>
dismissed because their attys made so many procedural mistakes. The drug<br/>
company lost all their atty fees and had to pay court costs.<br/>
<br/>
I benefited greatly from that process, in so many ways. I learned a whole<br/>
lot about the legal system. I stayed strong and determined for what was<br/>
right. I stuck to the truth no matter what else was flung my way. And in the<br/>
end, we never even fought it out because I knew enough about the system by<br/>
then to show what they did wrong (didn&#39;t send me their evidence exhibits<br/>
before the trial, didn&#39;t engage in court-assigned settlement procedure, et<br/>
al). I would have loved to come to the end and had Mr. Judge determine the<br/>
truth, that I was not liable, but that was okay. All was well.<br/>
<br/>
Some people will just keep going and going in a hurtful pattern until they<br/>
are stopped. I suspect that this woman of which you speak is one of them. I<br/>
encourage you to do something legal about her Angela. It may give you<br/>
discomfort initially, but  this may also be an opportunity for you to<br/>
release some of that. Maybe it is effecting other areas in your life too?<br/>
<br/>
Horsewoman relies on people not doing anything to her. She knows that most<br/>
people will just complain and get mad, but they won&#39;t legally go after her.<br/>
<br/>
Court and law can seem like big ominous things, but so many con artists<br/>
count on people thinking and feeling this way.<br/>
<br/>
One option is to go to small claims court which has a nominal fee<br/>
involved...you used to be able to sue someone for $2500 or less in Ohio in<br/>
small claims court. The cost was $25. It may be different where you are, but<br/>
may be worth looking into.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2113294513">Jacki,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing your story.  Unfortunately, I doubt I would have a foot<br/>
hold in court and honestly it wouldn&#39;t be worth the trouble as much as I<br/>
would like to stop this woman from doing the same thing to another family.<br/>
(However, the horse world is a small place and word does get around) I did<br/>
not get the return policy in writing.  (big mistake- I learned and haven&#39;t<br/>
repeated that mistake again)  The bill of sale was &quot;as is&quot;.  The return<br/>
policy was a verbal agreement between us, her word against mine probably,<br/>
although I did have a witness.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Of course now I don&#39;t own the horse anymore either, so I can&#39;t give it back<br/>
to get my money back.  I also had to pay board on the horse for several<br/>
months before I could find a buyer who would buy a horse that I told them<br/>
bucked and had issues.  It&#39;s not easy to sell a horse like that.  I ended up<br/>
trading her for an older pony, which was a pretty big loss monetarily but<br/>
money wasn&#39;t the only thing I considered.  I knew the horse was going to a<br/>
home where they could handle her and correct her behavior issues, it got me<br/>
out from under board payments, and I felt strongly that the old pony we got<br/>
would be a safe mount for my dd and if not that he would be easier to sell<br/>
even if I couldn&#39;t get as much for him.  When you board you have to take<br/>
into consideration the monthly cost of board when you hold on to them month<br/>
after month.  He is the sweetest old boy though and we wouldn&#39;t have found<br/>
him if it wasn&#39;t for the other horse because he wasn&#39;t listed for sale<br/>
anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
One good thing happened from the correspondence yesterday.  My dd, who had<br/>
held a lot of anger toward the horse and the previous owner, was able to let<br/>
it go and move past it.  She actually said she feels love for the horse that<br/>
we sold and wasn&#39;t sure why.  We are going to go visit her soon.  I think<br/>
she was able to let go of the pain that was associated with the whole thing<br/>
and stop blaming it on the horse by confronting the previous owner who had<br/>
lied to us.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I had more thoughts to add about this but the girls are getting ready to<br/>
ride and I am off to help them, then they are babysitting my nephew for a<br/>
few hours for some extra money.  If we have time between those two events,<br/>
we&#39;ll go see the horse that we sold.  It&#39;ll be nice to see her behaving<br/>
herself.  :-)<br/>

It IS very cool.  I am so glad she has found some peace concerning that<br/>
whole thing.  I am so glad I let her write the letter and actually send it<br/>
off.  We didn&#39;t have time enough today to go see the horse but maybe this<br/>
week-end.  The kids got side tracked with a horse racing game and they have<br/>
a babysitting gig this afternoon.<br/>

I have found around here that trying to find an honest horse seller is like<br/>
trying to find a needle in a hay stack.  NO ONE seems to tell the truth.<br/>
I&#39;ve bought 3 horses now and took one on a lease and not one of the sellers<br/>
was completely honest.  And I was buying horses for children!  You would<br/>
think that if you had any kind of couth at all that you would not lie to<br/>
someone buying a horse for an 8 or 10 year old.  How does one live with<br/>
oneself if that kid gets hurt?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1738099059">This was also sent to me privately---I mean--- as well as the AL list.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking---what in the world did I DO??? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry you had such a bad experience. I know you can&#39;t trust horse <br/>
traders! I once knew two Saddlebred/Walker horse trader-partners: Joe <br/>
Cheatham and Pete Steele. &lt;BWG&gt; Now, *they* were a pair! Well-named <br/>
duo! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My policy was to take the horse and keep him for a spell---1-2 weeks. <br/>
That way you can get a good feel. If the horse were drugged for <br/>
temperament or lameness, it would usually show up by then. Only <br/>
unreputable folks wouldn&#39;t let you do that. Those with your child&#39;s and <br/>
the horse&#39;s best interests at heart have no problem with a trial. Too, <br/>
that way you can see how he&#39;ll act with your other horses, in a foreign <br/>
barn/field/ring, and on the ground and how destructive or sour or <br/>
whatever he is/can be.<br/>
<br/>
Lessons learned though. Sorry Lilly had to go through it.<br/>

Who the hell knows, really.  It&#39;s something that I&#39;d like to believe but I<br/>

<br/>
My point was missed.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think people who let those kinds of crimes go without trying  <br/>
to prosecute are simply leaving those people to their eventual fate  <br/>
and guilty conscience.  I think they&#39;re setting them loose on other  <br/>
children, other women.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t need to discuss it at length; it&#39;s depressing.<br/>
As listowner, though, I didn&#39;t want a statement to stand that sounded  <br/>
like it was fine to let bad behavior, crime or evil go (depending  <br/>
what range one is considering; they&#39;re not all the same) simply  <br/>
thinking eventually the guy will get caught and punished.   <br/>
&quot;Eventually&quot; might mean after he kills 20 women instead of just  <br/>
roughing  up one.<br/>

that eventually people WILL get their come-uppance in one way or<br/>
another.<br/>

Would that apply to rapists and child molesters?&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Oh, I agree.  That would be a terrible thing to do in the case of rape or<br/>
any type of violence.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
However, when it comes to the buying and selling of horses (not feeling<br/>
badly here, just trying to explain) there are a whole slew of things that<br/>
come into play that aren&#39;t as cut and dried as something like rape.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Buyer beware.  I don&#39;t think anyone goes into a horse transaction without<br/>
knowing this.  Most horse sellers don&#39;t point out the horses faults as much<br/>
as they shine a light on their good qualities.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
And the thing is (and I knew this) a horse may not be the same for you as he<br/>
was for his last owner/rider.  He may not like you.  He may not like the way<br/>
you ride.  He may not have had a lot asked of him before and so he never got<br/>
in huff enough to complain. (be rude or buck) Then you buy him and ask him<br/>
to work off your leg and on the bit and suddenly he baulks and things can<br/>
change quickly.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes horse sellers are just plain ignorant.  It&#39;s also possible that<br/>
she had owned this horse (for 8 years, she said) and it WAS quiet for her<br/>
and so she had no reason to think we would return her.  She used the horse<br/>
as a trail horse, showed her some, and she was an adult riding the horse<br/>
with long legs.  My dd is small, even for an 8 year old. (she was 8 then,<br/>
almost 9).  The horse hadn&#39;t had children on her very much and not a child<br/>
who knew what they were doing and asked a lot of her.  (which is why I<br/>
wanted a trial period)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Still, the woman did disappear after telling us we had three weeks in which<br/>
to return her.  I made a couple mistakes there.  I did not get it in<br/>
writing.  I also paid in full for the horse instead of putting a down<br/>
payment down or withholding payment until I found out if she worked out.<br/>
She did tell me in an email the other day that she did get my letters<br/>
eventually (months later because she&#39;s an over the road trucker now and<br/>
didn&#39;t get her mail for months) but she assumed after reading the second one<br/>
that things had worked out.  In the first letter I told her I wanted to<br/>
return the horse (explained why).  In the second I said, &quot;haven&#39;t heard from<br/>
you..things are looking a bit better but I NEED to talk with you.  PLEASE<br/>
CALL ME.&quot;  (we still weren&#39;t sure if she&#39;d work out or not because she was<br/>
doing better for a time but if given the chance I&#39;d have returned her<br/>
because I wasn&#39;t looking for a horse we had to work with)  She took the &quot;a<br/>
bit better and decided not to call.&quot;  After that I continued to call the X<br/>
several times and even let him know we were selling the horse.  He told me<br/>
he&#39;d pass the word on.  (She had put in the contract that she wanted first<br/>
option to buy her back if we sold her, isn&#39;t that sweet? Was it just bait?<br/>
Or did she really care?) But in talking to the woman who sold us the horse,<br/>
she said she was fighting with her X at the time and he never gave her the<br/>
messages.  Messy!  Not really very cut and dried at all.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The horse was quiet and good the three times we tried her at the X&#39;s house.<br/>
(different times of the day)  After the first buck (second time dd rode her<br/>
after we got her home) she had a quiet spell but then after spooking and<br/>
taking off on her once, she quickly came to realize she got out of work when<br/>
she did that.  Her behavior escalated from cantering off (not an honest<br/>
spook after the first one though) to cantering off, bucking, and then doing<br/>
a buck/rear/spinny thing.  She was a smart horse and figured out how to get<br/>
Lilly off her.  Unfortunately, we didn&#39;t know anyone at the time with the<br/>
ability to ride her and work her through it.  A couple of more advanced<br/>
students tried to but quickly decided they couldn&#39;t handle her.  I was<br/>
riding her at the time (I&#39;m still a beginner) at walk/trot and not asking a<br/>
lot of her and she was fine for me.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If the woman REALLY cared about the horse, she wouldn&#39;t have disappeared<br/>
without giving us a head&#39;s up as to how we could get a hold of her.  (She<br/>
has two kids who live with the X, there must be a way through the trucking<br/>
co. plus she said she was moving.a new phone number would have been good)<br/>
She was a rat, no doubt about it.  She didn&#39;t want the horse back, imo, just<br/>
the money.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Did she move back to Maine and buy horses this summer and then use her work<br/>
as an excuse to *have* to sell them?  It looks like it.  Do I think she just<br/>
bought them to turn around and sell them again and make some money?  Yes. A<br/>
lot of people buy horses cheap and work with them and resell them.  Is it<br/>
just a little white lie as to why she says she&#39;s selling the horses?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a complicated thing is all I am trying to say.  I don&#39;t think I would<br/>
have a leg to stand on in a court of law and I don&#39;t think even taking her<br/>
to court in this part of the country would affect her anymore than spreading<br/>
the word about what happened through the horse world. It certainly isn&#39;t a<br/>
headliner. <br/>

My objection wasn&#39;t about this situation, it was about your summary  <br/>
of the situation which seemed generalized to all micreants.  Letting  <br/>
this one slide is understandable.  Letting violent crimes slide would  <br/>
be a whole &#39;nother thing.<br/>
