<div id="ygrps-yiv-189107149">Good morning!<br/>
   <br/>
  I would like to introduce myself to this group.<br/>
  I am a 34 yr. old unschooling mom of 4-- dd-11, dd-8, dd-6, & ds-4. <br/>
  I love being with them (most days!! LOL) and helping them as their guide and example (working on that!) <br/>
  I believe in my heart unschooling works, but do occasional battle with the old &quot;ghosts&quot; I was indoctrinated with and in which we are bombarded with every day-- anyone know what I mean? <br/>
  My kids never cease to astonish and amaze me with their ability to learn and impact their world without curriculum and lessons. <br/>
  I am looking forward to meeting some of you and gleaning wisdom from more experienced unschoolers.  Hopefully I will help someone in the process.<br/>
   <br/>
