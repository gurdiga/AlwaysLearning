Well...we bought one for my son for Christmas, and it&#39;s a blast. Very fun and <br/>
festive.<br/>
We got it when I discovered that a couple places started making vegetarian <br/>
marshmallows again. Julian hadn&#39;t had a S&#39;more for years and years. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1770868849">Opps! So sorry I shouldn&#39;t have been so flippant. :-( I&#39;m sure it is<br/>
fun.<br/>
    Vegetarian marshmalows? I thought marshmallows were made of nothing but<br/>
sugar. Is it the food coloring or corn starch? Made me curious so I looked.<br/>
