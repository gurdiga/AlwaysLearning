When people ask if you ever take a day off, now you can honestly say &quot;Yes, we do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This will be Learn Nothing Day #5.  The first one was in 2008.  People still learned, that first year, but we&#39;ve had a few years to get better at it now. And with two weeks to plan, I hope you&#39;ll all find great success.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1697311927">Oh, brilliant! My kids will be stuck in the car all day that day. We might just have a chance. It would be easier if you knew of a supplier of some knock-out drugs that wouldn&#39;t even let them dream. Oh, but one of us will have to stay awake. Drat. Would be bad for traffic if we didn&#39;t. Well, we&#39;ll do our best.<br/>
