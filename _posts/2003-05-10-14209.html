<div id="ygrps-yiv-1996859365">On the Road has such a special place in my heart.  My father gave me his copy from when he was in high school, when I was in high school.  I have read it several times.  And since I grew up in Des Moines, Iowa....I really loved the parts where Kerouac  wrote &quot;There were the most beautiful bevies of girls everywhere I looked in Des Moines...&quot;  and &quot;...the prettiest girls in the world live in Des Moines.&quot;  :::evil grin:::  <br/>

&gt; I was just reading On The Road (Kerouac) for my book club (which I love, a great group of women, wouldn&#39;t miss it!).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I didn&#39;t much like the book overall, but there were parts that his wording was just beautiful.  The kind that made me stop and read one sentence over several times because it just sounded good!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As far as the basic story of On the Road, they were mostly high most of the time.<br/>
