<div id="ygrps-yiv-910813031">I had 2 different awesome moments with my 3.5 y/o ds yesterday that left me<br/>
feeling like a Good Dad.<br/>
<br/>
He and I were at Lowe&#39;s, and they have a hot dog stand near the Exit where<br/>
he likes to stop.  He got a hot dog, and we sat down to eat.  The bun was<br/>
falling apart, and he was getting upset.  I tried to use the pieces of bun<br/>
arranged on different pieces of hot dog to give him what I thought he<br/>
wanted.a nice looking piece of meat inside of 2 pieces of bun.  But he kept<br/>
getting more upset.  &quot;I no like that!&quot;  In the past, I would have probably<br/>
gotten short with him.  But as this went on, and I tried in vain to arrange<br/>
the pieces of hot dog and bun (falling apart) in yet another arrangement, I<br/>
just kept trying to plug into him more, and kept smiling, staying calm.<br/>
Finally he said, &quot;I want more ketchup!&quot;  He had been mutilating the hot dog<br/>
just trying to find the bits of bun that had the most ketchup on them.  So I<br/>
just grabbed a bottle of ketchup and squirted a large blog on the side of<br/>
his plate, and he was in dunking heaven, and we went back to having fun.<br/>
<br/>
Last night, his mama was already in bed, and he and I were watching<br/>
Spongebob on tv.  As we were turning it off to go to bed, headed down the<br/>
hall, he said, &quot;wait!&quot;, and went back in the kitchen, and I followed.  He<br/>
picked up a leftover piece of pancake on the counter and said, &quot;I want<br/>
this&quot;.  I thought he meant he wanted to take it to bed, but I wasn&#39;t sure.<br/>
Sometimes he likes to eat something just before bed (not *in* bed), but I<br/>
was really tired.  But instead of starting into a list of reasons why I&#39;d<br/>
prefer him not to take crumbly food to a dark bed at 11pm with mommy already<br/>
asleep in it, or trying to push some food on him quickly so I could get to<br/>
bed quicker, I just kept listening to what was going on.  Finally I<br/>
understood that he did not want to leave the food (about 4 tablespoons worth<br/>
of pancake) out on the counter, and wanted it in the fridge.  No problem!  I<br/>
got a paper towel and wrapped the pancake, and he put it in the fridge and<br/>
we went to bed happy.  This is the first time he&#39;s ever taken action to<br/>
preserve food, and I&#39;m glad I was open to it, instead of arguing with him<br/>
about what I *thought* he wanted. And this morning he went straight to the<br/>
fridge when he got up, and brought me the paper-towel-wrapped pancake to<br/>
heat up for him.  And he told me again, &quot;See, I want this!  Me no leave<br/>
out.&quot;  He&#39;s always just watched us put things away, but the pancake was<br/>
important enough to him to want to put it away himself.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been really concentrating on being Present with him the past few weeks,<br/>
not making assumptions about what he &quot;usually&quot; wants in any given situation,<br/>
and I&#39;m feeling more connected with him than I have in several months.<br/>

That&#39;s a really cool story, and the hotdog too.  They  might&#39;ve given  <br/>
you another bun, but the ketchup was the important thing.  Very sweet.<br/>
<br/>
Once the real, natural feedback started happening with me, when Kirby  <br/>
was little, and I REALLY knew that what we were doing was  <br/>
strengthening our family and all the relationships within it, I was   <br/>
hooked.  I didn&#39;t just feel like a good mom, I knew it.  Culture at  <br/>
large will say &quot;good mom!&quot; or &quot;good dad!&quot; when you&#39;re mean to kids,  <br/>
and sometimes they say &quot;bad...&quot; when you&#39;re nice to them.  It&#39;s not  <br/>
an easy thing to see the manipulation in that and to make decisions  <br/>
on what truly makes things better in your heart and your child&#39;s life.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s the part that has always pleasantly surprised me.  When you<br/>
really stop and listen to what your children want, and trust that their<br/>
reasons are equally valid, you assumptions get thrown aside to some<br/>
remote corner of the world because it had nothing at all to do with what<br/>
was actually happening.<br/>
<br/>
Chamille and I are desiging a transgendered mutant hillbilly zombie<br/>
costume.  That was her idea to throw the transgendered thing in there. <br/>
So we have that description along with &quot;the hills have eyes&quot; kind of<br/>
feel about it mixed in with scrap metal yard as the setting for this<br/>
zombie.  I haven&#39;t seen that movie, nor will I.  Chamille has so I&#39;m<br/>
totally going off her visual.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve known this, and experienced it before, but this is really the first<br/>
trully collaberative project that we&#39;ve worked on, and I&#39;m continually<br/>
surprised by what is in her head.  In the past I&#39;ve either just taken<br/>
what she told me and interpreted it, or she&#39;s done it herself.  This<br/>
time, she is going off her image and I&#39;m merely the engineer.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m getting a new and interesting peek into her unusual mind.  What she<br/>
has in there is sooo different from anything that I&#39;ve experienced with<br/>
any other person.  I get to know her and appreciate her on a whole new<br/>
level.  Sometimes I think I know her really well, and sometimes I get a<br/>
glimpse of how trully I don&#39;t.  It&#39;s fun!</div>
