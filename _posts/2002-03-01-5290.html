<div id="ygrps-yiv-1825406909">Actually, the party is in northern California, but non-northern<br/>
Californians are welcome to attend ;-)<br/>
<br/>
You are hereby cordially invited to the Spring on the Lane- Brownold Farm<br/>
/ Welcome Home Dar and Cacie party on the fram near Dunnigan, California.<br/>
We&#39;ll start around noon on Saturday, April 6 and end sometimes Sunday<br/>
afternoonish, April 7. A group of NBTSC kids will be spending the week<br/>
visiting, so in-house sleeping space is pretty much taken, but the<br/>
weather will be gorgeous and there&#39;s plenty of room for pitching a tent,<br/>
or you can stay the the Best Western in Dunnigan, or make it a day trip,<br/>
or if we unpack enough boxes by then we *may*  have some room in our<br/>
house.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re about 2 hours from San Francsco or an hour from Sacramento, near<br/>
the intersection of Highways 5 and 505.  Generally everyone brings a dish<br/>
to share, many games are played far into the night, and everyone is free<br/>
to roam around and play with the dogs, chickens, barn owls (who don&#39;t<br/>
really play back), tire swing, sandbox, etc., etc., and to talk and talk,<br/>
and often knit although it&#39;s not required. We guarnatee many interesting<br/>
people...<br/>
<br/>
I swear we&#39;re not spamming every list with invites, just two, so you&#39;re<br/>
guaranteed not to see this more than twice. I&#39;d love to meet anyone who<br/>
can make it , and if you&#39;re interested but can&#39;t make it this time, we do<br/>
pretty much same thing every Septmeber.<br/>
<br/>
Email me for more info,<br/>
