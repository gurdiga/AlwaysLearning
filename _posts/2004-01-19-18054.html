<div id="ygrps-yiv-1564892382">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
My 6yo has decided to start experimenting with different hair colors. We started with black henna -- because it&#39;s the only non-toxic thing we could find for black. And, I must say, her new darker look is so cool! She would like to try bright colors next (ie. blue, purple) and I&#39;m at a loss re: how to do this in a non-toxic manner. I read something about using kool-aid and am wondering if you can do this on dark hair or if we&#39;d need to lighten it up first. Also, if we need to lighten her hair back up, is there a way to do this in a non-toxic, chemical free manner?<br/>
<br/>
Are there any families out there who have played around with natural hair dying? Thanks in advance for any and all tips/feedback.<br/>

I knew this knowledge would come in handy some day!  I had a friend in high<br/>
school who often dyed her hair with Kool-Aid.  She used two to three packets<br/>
(depending on how dark she wanted it) of the unsweetened Kool-Aid powder.<br/>
She dissolved it in 2 quarts of warm vinegar.  Warm the hair first by taking<br/>
a warm shower (opens up the hair to receive the dye) then soak the parts of<br/>
the hair you want dyed for about 15-20 minutes.  If you want all of it dyed<br/>
with no roots showing fill a bowl with the mixture and tip your head back<br/>
into it.  The color lasted for about three weeks.  I think a color like red<br/>
or purple would look great on top of already darkened (i.e. with henna)<br/>
hair.<br/>
<br/>
As for the non-toxic part, I am not sure how I would classify the coloring<br/>
agents in Kool-Aid FD &C #6 etc. but at least you know they are safe enough<br/>
to eat!  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, let us know what happens!<br/>

she turns 8) <br/>
