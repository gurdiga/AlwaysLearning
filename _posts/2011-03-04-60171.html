<div id="ygrps-yiv-1930264672">Our family moved into a new school district in Minnesota last fall. Since<br/>
then several strange events happened. The school district was tipped off<br/>
(possibly by our Medicare worker) and since then they have been going around<br/>
our backs trying to find ways to &quot;get&quot; to our kids, going as far as to call<br/>
our tester and illegally ask for the annual test results. (Minnesota law<br/>
says that an annual test must be taken but the results are kept privately.)<br/>
<br/>
We were also paid a visit by a policeman acting on behalf of CPS to<br/>
investigate a call that our kids were in danger because the electricity was<br/>
&quot;shut off.&quot; The cop found this claim to be false the minute he stepped into<br/>
our home, and fortunately was supportive of our homeschooling. The anonymous<br/>
caller described my husband and I&#39;s disabilities accurately. Enough time has<br/>
passed for us to recover the shock and betrayal we felt about those events.<br/>
We have been working to be sure we follow the law in our home state but this<br/>
has made us less likely to trust people.<br/>
<br/>
What can we do to help this situation? I am a mother bear when it comes to<br/>
protecting my children and their education, but I am acutely aware of my<br/>
&quot;disability&quot; and our unschooling causing others to doubt my competency in<br/>
raising my children. I do not want to be bullied into sending my kids to<br/>
school, nor do I want to adopt a fearful, reactionary approach with my<br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
How can we retain our boundaries and protect our children from situations<br/>
like this? Any advice?<br/>

Maybe you could write a friendly, interesting letter to the editor or a guest editorial somewhere in your town where you can get copies and provide to neighbors or relatives or anyone who comes by.   Maybe you could be interviewed by an unschooler already in Minnesota.   Having been in the media might be helpful<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1688195315">I would recommend locating some support groups in your area.  People who<br/>
have experience with the local officials may be able to provide good<br/>
advice.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe some investigation into the people who have been making inquiries.<br/>
Most states will not divulge the name of the person who made a CPS report,<br/>
but you may be able to find out the name of the person who called your<br/>
tester.<br/>
<br/>
I would also look into the confidentiality rules that the medicare worker is<br/>
required to adhere to.  File complaints with appropriate entities if those<br/>
rules were violated.  If you just ask the worker what the confidentiality<br/>
requirements of him or her are they may realize that they should not be<br/>
sharing information about your &quot;disability&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
You may also find that since the policeman has been to your home and found<br/>
nothing amiss, then they will leave you alone.<br/>
<br/>
The policeman, I am sure, was sent to gain a bird&#39;s eye view of your home<br/>
situation.  I do not know Minnesota, could it be that this district is<br/>
particularly unfriendly to homeschooling?  If you find some other local<br/>
homeschoolers, they may be able to give you better info about the<br/>
personalities involved.  I have heard nightmare stories of one official that<br/>
used his or her position to try to intimidate people into giving up<br/>
homeschooling.  There may be other people in your area who have been<br/>
similarly targeted, if so , you could rally forces and strategize together.<br/>

I wish every unschooling family would do this.  I wish there had been blogs when my kids were little.  I kept a diary for each child in Word, and sometimes I quote from those, but they&#39;re totally separate from photos of the same incidents and outings.<br/>
<br/>
Not only are such blogs evidence for activity and learning, they will help the parents see how far they&#39;ve come, or where they&#39;re slacking, and will allow relatives in distant places to see happy children, rather than imagining lack and isolation.<br/>

<br/>
The worst might be over.   <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re complying with the law then you don&#39;t have to feel guilty.    Don&#39;t live like you feel guilty or have something to hide.   If you suspect a neighbor, bake some cookies and take them over.   Sandra&#39;s idea about a &quot;friendly, interesting&quot; letter to the editor is great.  <br/>
<br/>
Dylan was stopped by police at different times when he was out during school hours and once when he was walking at night.   We live in a small town and every new person is suspicious.  Every different person is suspicious.  When Dylan first got his learners permit to drive we were driving around town very late and someone called the cops because we seemed suspicious.   I think he was practicing left turns so we maybe circled the same block too many times. &lt;g.&gt;   We got pulled over, lights and all.  Poor Dylan.  Poor old lady, peaking out her window late at night, looking for sneaky bad guys.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe you live in an area where the population is mostly older people?    Older people don&#39;t often think of homeschooling when they see kids out during the day, they think, &quot;truant.&quot;    And for older people, especially, if a person seems to be neglecting their house and yard and then their kids are outside making noise during school hours, well that starts to look like a pattern of neglect.   Shovel your sidewalks.  Clean your house.  Have a neighbor over for coffee. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>

<br/>
Another thing about older people, and childless people, is sometimes the resent paying the taxes that support schools.  The only benefit they see to themselves is that they have six hours of quiet, of all the kids being locked away elsewhere.  Sometimes those are the people most irritated by the idea that their neighbors might be homeschooling.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Chris, there&#39;s not a local group here but Alex did list some good resources that I wasn&#39;t aware of. I&#39;ll contact those groups and see.<br/>
<br/>
As for investigating who made the call, we asked and they said the caller was anonymous. No way to track down who did it. That galls me because the caller specifically listed our disabilities and it felt like we were being persecuted. <br/>
<br/>
A friend of ours informed us that once CPS gets a call, they keep the record open and can see medical records, bills, etc. Can anyone verify the actual scope of CPS?<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately I know who made the call re: test scores -- the tester was very supportive and told us. We may follow up on that. <br/>

<br/>
It was a suggestion in general, not for one specific family.  That&#39;s how this list works.<br/>
<br/>
It was a suggestion intended to turn more attention toward your family in a good way, so lots of people in your town would know you were unschooling.  If you don&#39;t want that, then it&#39;s not a good idea for you, but it might be a good idea for others on the list.  <br/>
<br/>
If you say &quot;Here we are, here&#39;s who we are, and here&#39;s what we&#39;re doing,&quot; you might find support and friendship.  If you hide, others will wonder why.<br/>
<br/>
ALL discussion of test scores and state policies and lists is off topic for this discussion list.<br/>

<br/>
There are over 2,000 people on this list, and you didn&#39;t mention deafness, which is okay, but then it matters in light of this question.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers shouldn&#39;t have other factors than other families about where to live, ideally.  What are good factors for a family with deaf family members?  What are problems for that?  Cheaply built, thin walls, lots of neighbors, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
Some unschoolers think moving out to the country without neighbors is ideal, but then they have problems when their kids are young teens and want to meet more people, or want to get jobs at 15 or 16 and live too far from town.<br/>
<br/>
A yard is nice, though, so walls aren&#39;t shared, if that&#39;s possible.  But it still doesn&#39;t relieve a family of the requirement to observe noise ordinances.<br/>
<br/>
Where homeschooling is legal, a family needs to find ways to live within those laws.  Unschooling is a method of homeschooling that a family needs to understand well enough to justify within their state&#39;s laws, if they&#39;re asked.  It&#39;s not something that&#39;s &quot;guaranteed&quot; or can be protected.  It&#39;s something that should be lived openly enough that others don&#39;t feel they can or would want to intimidate the unschooling family.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why I recommended seeking to introduce yourselves to the community or even to be interviewed, so that anyone who wondered should be shown a copy of the article or interview.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-431751043">If it is difficult to find the time to write, Flickr is another possibility. It&#39;s a photo-sharing site. I post photos regularly and add captions. Some kids might like to have their own flickr site (you can post up to 200 photos for free).<br/>
<br/>
We live in a state that requires annual evaluations. The photos and captions can be expanded upon to sound schooly enough to satisfy the evaluator.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It helped our family to move to a bigger house when the kids were 6-11 years old, and getting too big to share a room.  The old house had only three or four  places, really to get away from other people.  The new house had a dozen, and that relieved tension and crowding.  It also kept us from being so close at night, so that was the downside.<br/>
