this boardgame-style video game), and you can start each person out with  <br/>
different amounts of stars for different skill abilities or, in Wyl&#39;s case, no <br/>
 extra stars for excellent skill, so there is a more level playing field.  <br/>
Sometimes, in the minigames he&#39;s especially good at, Wyl will give the rest <br/>

Playing with an upside down controller sounds fun! We&#39;ll have  to try that <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-236333354">Those suggestions are very welcomed.<br/>
I am surprised at the options at hand. I feel relieved that Dad can make choices too :-)<br/>
We are all new to games as none of our families played games.We will try those new ways with joy.  <br/>

<br/>
Guitar Hero and Rock Band, you can set the level of difficulty for  <br/>
each player.<br/>
<br/>
We used to play a lot of Dr. Mario and Kirby&#39;s Avalanche, and those  <br/>
can have one play playing a faster game against another play whose  <br/>
things are dropping more slowly, and fewer of them, who might win.<br/>
