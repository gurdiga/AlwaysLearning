<div id="ygrps-yiv-1598464150">Three years ago, via Internet, I met a family of 5 that asked for<br/>
playgroup<br/>
mates.  They were fm USA and had lived longer in Japan than I<br/>
had. They<br/>
homeschooled, that is, every time we met we all played.  The year<br/>
before last<br/>
I went to teach &quot;intercultural communication&quot; to a ps in the area<br/>
we live.  I<br/>
wanted to see how the ps in our area looked like.  There were fm<br/>
32 to 41<br/>
pupils in each class.  I played bingo, sang songs, told my<br/>
personal story,<br/>
danced with them.  Pupils in the grade 6 could not keep their<br/>
knees under the<br/>
desk, classes and activities were minutely assigned, the walls<br/>
were mostly<br/>
gray, the three teachers of grade one taught the same lessons on<br/>
the same day.  They only had 20 min. brake to play after the 20<br/>
min. lunch time.  That was a place that I would not want to spend<br/>
most of the day.<br/>
<br/>
The international school near out place asked for six thousand<br/>
year tuition.  For that amount of money, I decided that I could<br/>
educate my dd.<br/>
<br/>
One day fm my way home fm the ps classes, I found &quot;How children<br/>
learn&quot; John Holt.  After 2 days I was convinced that children are<br/>
learning beings, there were no need to teach them.<br/>
......<br/>
As for hs in Japan, pls visit the home page that the family of 5<br/>
fm USA have built. : <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.homeschoolinginjapan.org">http://www.homeschoolinginjapan.org</a><br/>
