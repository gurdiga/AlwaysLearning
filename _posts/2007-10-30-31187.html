<div id="ygrps-yiv-175131257">Hi all.  I&#39;ve been joined for a little while now and finally got up<br/>
the nerve to post. <br/>
<br/>
My name is Carol, 37 years old, married, live in Indiana, happy mama<br/>
to 3 wonderful teenage boys, 18,16 and 14.  I&#39;m a happy, radical<br/>
unschooler who is married to an ex-math teacher but somehow we&#39;ve made<br/>
it work! ;)<br/>
<br/>
I was just going through some of the older posts and saw the trip to<br/>
the Kalahari Resort planned in January.  We were just there for the<br/>
1st time two weeks ago.  It is an amazing place and I think we are<br/>
going to try and make it there for the Unschooling Convo.  I can&#39;t<br/>
imagine how much MORE fun that will be with a group of unschoolers there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391338504">Hi Carol!  I haven&#39;t &quot;officially&quot; introduced myself either.  I am Jana and live next door in KY.  We are looking forward to that trip and glad you enjoyed yourself and the place a couple weeks ago.  I also have boys who are 17, 15, 12 & 10, the younger 2 are the only ones at home now.   Nice to &quot;meet&quot; you.  :)     Jana, Genaro & boys in Lexington<br/>
