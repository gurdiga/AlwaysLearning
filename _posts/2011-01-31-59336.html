<div id="ygrps-yiv-201722649">My daughter Noor, who is 7, wants to make a chain mail tunic. She doesn&#39;t want me to make it, although she said I may help. I&#39;ve been reading up on it for the past few days, and I&#39;m thinking the easiest way to go about it is probably to use pre-made rings, like jump rings for jewelry or maybe even key chain rings.<br/>
<br/>
When we learned that it was often young children who linked the rings together, Noor became even more determined to make the &quot;real&quot; kind. I&#39;d previously suggested we cut some window screens or shelf-liner into a tunic, but she&#39;s pretty set on making something as authentic as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone made chain mail with young kids? Any suggestions? Links? Supply ideas? Ways to set up to make the process easier for small hands?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-826690550">This is what I was thinking of buying if we use pre-made rings (10 gauge, stainless steel):<br/>

<br/>
They&#39;re split rings, like on a key chain. Would that be easier than dealing with two sets of pliers with un-split rings? I think so, but I&#39;m not sure that she&#39;s strong enough to splice the rings together.<br/>
<br/>
She wants to make a 4 in 1 European weave, if that helps.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
