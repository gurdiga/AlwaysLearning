<div id="ygrps-yiv-1613942438">Hi. Do the moderators know of discussion boards that address the philosophy of unschooling applied outside of unschooling families? I have been reading Always Learning for a while. I don&#39;t have children. I am interested in working with kids who aren&#39;t my own and creating &quot;an unschooling nest&quot; with a bunch of kids. Like a free school, as I understand them. I don&#39;t know of anywhere to discuss those ideas. I would love help! Thank you very much. <div><br></div>Kyja Wilburn<span></span></div>

Maybe look for discussions of alternative education.  They will have other terminology that might be more useful to you.<br/>

Think of creating a rich learning environment with a bunch of kids. :-)  It won&#39;t be unschooling.  Read about open-classroom schools.<br/>
This might have links and resources you can use:<br/>
