<div id="ygrps-yiv-390313484">&quot;My son Skylar is blond, blue eyed and has the most incredible ringlets.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Boy does he ever...cute little guy for sure!!<br/>
My Jalen always gets called a girl. I just couldn&#39;t cut his hair even though <br/>
it isn&#39;t those beautiful ringlets like Skylar. But the other night, when I <br/>
thought I&#39;d finally cut it, I just got a sick feeling in my tummy and <br/>
couldn&#39;t do it!!<br/>
It&#39;s like saying goodbye to the baby and accepting the toddler. Just not <br/>
ready to do that yet. Maybe when he&#39;s two I&#39;ll give it a little trim.<br/>
Maybe not....<br/>

&quot;The answers aren&#39;t important really...<br/>
What&#39;s important,  is knowing all the questions.&quot;<br/>

  Thanks.<br/>

<br/>
  But he&#39;s so cute with his long hair (without it too I&#39;m sure:-)). It<br/>
doesn&#39;t have to be curly, his long hair just suits him.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
  That is so true. I think the other thing for me is being in a military<br/>
town where most of the little boys have a barbershop buzz.  I personally<br/>
don&#39;t like it. Just another way to buck the system, I suppose.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
  Shoot, Ren. He&#39;s got the rest of his life to cut his hair. Maybe four ;-)<br/>
