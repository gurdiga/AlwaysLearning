<div id="ygrps-yiv-640535031">welcome to all the newcomers! there is a lot of info<br/>
to absorb when considering/beginning unschooling. it<br/>
seems a lot of moms have differences of opinion with<br/>
their dh&#39;s on the unschool lists I am on, lol! in<br/>
addition to john holt, another author to check out<br/>
(for your own info as well as for your dh) is john<br/>
taylor gatto. some might also find alfie kohn<br/>
interesting, although I found his &quot;unconditional<br/>
parenting&quot; to be a bit condescending. his &quot;punished by<br/>
rewards&quot; is one that may be very relevant for a<br/>
reluctant dh.<br/>
<br/>
that article on quitting is truly fabulous! I used to<br/>
berate myself for being &quot;lazy.&quot; I was in grad school<br/>
working on a phd in chemistry and hated doing<br/>
research! I would avoid work in whatever way I could<br/>
manufacture. a very wise woman told me, &quot;we aren&#39;t<br/>
lazy when we&#39;re doing what we want to do.&quot; when was<br/>
the last time you avoided doing something you love? I<br/>
have learned that laziness is merely the symptom of<br/>
doing something that I find uninteresting. for the mom<br/>
in alaska (sorry I can&#39;t remember your name, I&#39;m on<br/>
digest and they all have run together now!), it sounds<br/>
like your dh might need some gentle support about not<br/>
liking his job! it sounds like he feels stuck, and<br/>
perhaps is resentful (those feelings often go together<br/>
for me!). it may not even be homeschooling that he is<br/>
against; it may be his fears talking-- fear of it<br/>
costing more money (if you are going to stop working,<br/>
for instance) or some other fear-based expectation<br/>
that he has. you might try active listening with him<br/>
around this (I have no idea how well he will respond,<br/>
not knowing him). ask him calmly, when you&#39;re not<br/>
already arguing about it, what it is about<br/>
homeschooling that he has concerns about. perhaps in a<br/>
separate conversation you might ask him about work--<br/>
is it more stressful lately? what would he do if he<br/>
could pick any job in the world? why does he think he<br/>
does not have the freedom to pursue that? just some<br/>
possibilities here... it is important on many levels<br/>
that he feels included in the decision, even if your<br/>
goal is to convince him of your way, and even if you<br/>
succeed in doing so. he may have some valid concerns<br/>
that you haven&#39;t thought of! however it goes, dh needs<br/>
to feel heard and needs his POV considered.<br/>
<br/>
I think, as others have said and implied, the litmus<br/>
test is the happiness of your children. if they seem<br/>
well-adjusted and generally happy, roll with it. you<br/>
mentioned that your son doesn&#39;t socialize much; if he<br/>
is content, it&#39;s probably just his personality,<br/>
something your dh will benefit from learning to<br/>
accept. this can be hard, as many adults were not<br/>
allowed to be themselves as children (or as adults,<br/>
for that matter!). if, however, your son seemed to be<br/>
*anti*social, or brooding, there might be something<br/>
else going on. but I doubt it has anything to do with<br/>
having him in or out of school! as for the one who<br/>
wants to stay in school, I agree with the post which<br/>
pointed out that you might be creating problems that<br/>
don&#39;t exist by pulling her out. &quot;if it ain&#39;t broke,<br/>
don&#39;t fix it!&quot; :D<br/>
<br/>
just take your time, and enjoy the ride!<br/>
