&gt;girl&#39; and he wants to look his best! <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This made me laugh.  This is my 7 year old.  Ever<br/>
since he was a toddler he has been a girl chaser,<br/>
literally.  He used to chase cute little girls in the<br/>
mall or other public places when he was a year or<br/>
less.  Precocious in more than just walking<br/>
apparently!  All his best friends, aside from his<br/>
brother, have been girls.  He is also in love with a<br/>
same age cousin, child of my brother.  I haven&#39;t the<br/>
heart to shatter all his inctricate plans by telling<br/>
him first cousins don&#39;t generally marry.  LOL<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sounds like my grandson. Kaelin is always talking about pretty girls and <br/>
pretty ladies. He likes to watch the &quot;pretty lady movie&quot;. (Sound of Music) <br/>
And he&#39;s started trying to hug or kiss any little girl he sees.<br/>
He&#39;s crazy about &quot;little girl&quot; stuff. He loves his dollhouse and asked for <br/>
one of the Groovy Girl mermaids for Christmas. He also loves the castle he <br/>
got and his &quot;brave knights&quot;.<br/>
He loves his Bob the Builder clothes and says, &quot;Me big boy!&quot;. But he also <br/>
loves to wear his sister&#39;s old tutu. For our Christmas Eve celebration, he <br/>
was asked what he wanted to wear. &quot;My white one.&quot; He meant the fancy white <br/>
dress his sister has grown out of. With his very long, wavy blonde hair . . <br/>
. he looked so cute. If anyone remembers the Christmas issue of Woman&#39;s Day <br/>
(I think that was the one) with the little blonde girl peeking out from <br/>
behind the Christmas tree, that could have been Kaelin except he&#39;s a little <br/>
older and his hair is longer. Later in the evening he opened a present with <br/>
a T shirt that had a muscle car on it. The dress came off and on went the T <br/>
shirt.<br/>
LOL!<br/>
He&#39;s *very* clear, though, about, &quot;Me big boy!&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1974039244">It&#39;s good to know my sons aren&#39;t the only ones falling in love with a cousin!  My oldest son had a huge crush on my youngest cousin (they are only 2mos apart in age) until about age 8 or so.  It did pass.  We let Andy have his little fantasy for now, knowing he&#39;ll outgrow it and that raining on his parade now would break his heart.  He&#39;s had other crushes, and recently a friend confided to me that her 7yo daughter has a crush on Andy.  We seem to have entered the boy/girl years already.  <br/>
<br/>
Just yesterday, Andy told me he really likes an older girl we know, but says he&#39;s afraid to tell her.  Knowing who she is, it&#39;s really sweet.  <br/>

Christmas and told her that she shouldn&#39;t tell anybody! I remember having a <br/>
crush on my cousin as a kid, too.<br/>
