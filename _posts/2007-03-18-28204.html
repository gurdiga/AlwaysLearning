<div id="ygrps-yiv-759496418">Someone asked on a state-specific homeschooling list i&#39;m on:&quot;I have <br/>
looked and looked and cannot find an answer to my question. Is<br/>
there a set number of credits that are needed to graduate? Set<br/>
courses? Or do we get to do what we want because we homeschool?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I responded:&quot;I&#39;m pretty sure we get to do what we want. Some <br/>
homeschooling parents make up a diploma for their child, give grades <br/>
etc. Since we don&#39;t &quot;do school&quot; in any way, shape, or form i don&#39;t <br/>
plan on doing that unless my son requests it. I will ask him if he <br/>
wants to take college classes when he&#39;s a teen, and will also offer <br/>
him the opportunity to take the GED if he so chooses.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Someone responded to my post with &quot;When and if your child wants to <br/>
go to college you will need a high school transcript with all the <br/>
required credits in your school district. Even with a high school <br/>
diploma issued by you they will require a transcript. Find out what<br/>
your local school requires and go from there.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Of course i responded that i dont think all colleges have the exact <br/>
same requirements, and that they really just want to be able to <br/>
check off a little box that they got the required form (such as a <br/>
transcript), that since my son is unschooled he does NOT HAVE a <br/>
transcript, and i dont think i would feel comfortable just making <br/>
one up with grades and such (since it would be a total fabrication)<br/>
but that i would be happy to write up an outline of the kinds of <br/>
work he&#39;s done, with appropriate &quot;subject&quot; designations if the need <br/>
be there. <br/>
<br/>
I also pointed out that if someone takes a GED they dont have a <br/>
transcript for high school, if they didnt go, but they can still get <br/>
into college. <br/>
<br/>
But then it occurred to me that i dont actually have any experience <br/>
in this situation, as my kid is only ten, but thought i would throw <br/>
it out there to see what other unschoolers&#39; experiences were. Esp, <br/>
at a non-community college which seems to have more flexible <br/>
admissions practices. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1642846609">Rain is going to be attending the University of Kansas next fall as a non-degree seeking student. They accepted her with SAT scores and a brief letter from me saying that she was a homeschooler and would benefit from college-level classes (I basically repeated their verbiage). <br/>
She specifically chose this route because it maintains her eligibility for various financial aid and scholarship opportunities if she should want to attend college elsewhere in the future (she&#39;s only 14 now). She&#39;s limited to 6 credits a semester this way, and she can&#39;t get financial aid. However, in Kansas, they would have given her regular (degree-seeking) admission if I had written that she had &quot;graduated&quot; from our homeschool high school and she had submitted the same SAT scores. No transcript would have been required.<br/>
FWIW, the SAT scores were, overall, above average for a high school senior, but not extraordinary. They only required that she score above the 50th percentile - an out of state student would have been required to submit slightly higher scores. She had never done any formal mathematics until she decided on this plan, and she spent about 2-3 months sporadically prepping for the SAT (mostly on math). <br/>

It&#39;s different state to state and university to university.  It&#39;s not  <br/>
the best of topics for this list.  Too local and too particular.   <br/>
It&#39;s not about learning, it&#39;s about hoop-jumping.<br/>
