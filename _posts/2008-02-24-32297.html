I don&#39;t know why, but if you use frozen vegetables you can microwave  <br/>
just a few bites at a time, or he could even eat them frozen, or  <br/>
thawed to room temperature.  That might be more fun than canned, and  <br/>
ultimately cheaper, too.<br/>

<br/>
If there&#39;s leftover rice or oatmeal, you could freeze it and add it  <br/>
to something you&#39;re cooking later, or if you have a dog you could add  <br/>
something else to it and make dog food.<br/>
<br/>
Stressing over something that costs less than a dollar should  <br/>
probably be compared to the price of one visit to a counsellor, or  <br/>
the cost of one day&#39;s worth of medication for high blood pressure.   <br/>
It&#39;s just not worth the anger.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-110772120">Holy cow. That sounds pretty mean-spirited.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, maybe ask the kid at another time, &quot;So, sometimes you ask for  <br/>
canned peas and then don&#39;t want them, why is that, do you think?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I used to read about certain foods, in books, and think I wanted them,  <br/>
but the reality was I didn&#39;t like them once I had them in front of me.  <br/>
I remember reading Heidi and wanting bread and lots of butter - but I  <br/>
really didn&#39;t like bread with butter spread thickly on it - it was  <br/>
absolutely disgusting to me to feel all that fat in my mouth.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - these are usually  phases, just ride it out and don&#39;t make a  <br/>
big deal out of it. You can put them into a baggie and put them in the  <br/>
freezer and dump them into a stew or soup later.<br/>

  Wow and make him feel guilt all his life about no finishing his food even if he is satisfied or does not like it?<br/>
  I heard that a LOT growing up and all it did was make me eat everthing in my plate even if I am done or do not like it. I feel guilty if I don&#39;t eat ( working on it).<br/>
  I also have a weight problem and think how much food I would not eat if it was not for that &quot;lesson&quot;.<br/>
  If he does not eat all of his food it will not automatically go to the starving kids in Darfur.<br/>
  My mom to this day cannot throw any food away. She will eat almost rotten food even if she is not hungry because she feels to guilty about the starving children in Africa.<br/>

Please, please be wary of recommendations about teaching children  <br/>
anything on this list.  When someone writes, &quot;You could teach your  <br/>
child....&quot; I think they&#39;re  not thinking and writing carefully for  <br/>
the target audience, or that they&#39;re very new here and haven&#39;t  <br/>
thought much about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
We can help children learn, but when a child is hungry but the food  <br/>
in front of him turns out not to be what he wants, that&#39;s no time to  <br/>
help him learn about famines and starvation and wars in other  <br/>
hemispheres.  Just because not every mother in the world can take  <br/>
care of her children shouldn&#39;t mean that we can&#39;t take tender care of  <br/>
ours.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-555215476">Wow you guys are really diggi*ng for negativity*<br/>
I didn&#39;t say you need to discuss starvation with your child while the<br/>
situation is at hand I was just talking about awareness My children are<br/>
unschooled and are thoughtful and intelligent and because of their tender<br/>
consciousness and care they bring up these issues Please understand I know<br/>
it would be mean and unecessary to bring up these topics during the<br/>
situation ..Also I agreed that it is not much money to spend on canned goods<br/>
or oatmeal etc I also know that these things could be composted ..I was<br/>
merely speaking of things to discuss or do to raise awareness at other times<br/>
and of coursein a age appropriate way.I do not beleive in the &quot;clean plate<br/>
club&quot;and would never make my kid eat all of or even any of aomething they<br/>
weren&#39;t enjoying I was thinking of ways to give them more input and self<br/>
creation into what they are eating and therefore by helping choose and<br/>
create fresh food have more power over there life and possibly more<br/>
enjoyment and interest in their food..I must say that I felt very attacked<br/>
by the responses to my post and for all of you who believe in unschooling<br/>
your children certainly seem to be all about schooling the other mothers in<br/>
the group ..I do noy guilt my kids into eating but I do let them cook..I was<br/>
responding to a mom who was getting her words not mine&quot;angry &quot; about her<br/>
child opening cans of food they usually like multiple times a day and not<br/>
eating them..I personally don&#39;t have this problem my husband is a chef and<br/>
my kids love cooking and we hardly use canned veggies except for beans and<br/>
occasionally corn or peas to put into other things..I am sorry you found<br/>
what I said &quot;mean spirited &quot; and I find it &quot;mean spirited &quot;to attack other<br/>
people or look for the most negative conotations you can wrench from a<br/>
paragraph that is why I made a point to say &quot;this may sound old fashioned&quot;<br/>
,,but i don&#39;t believe in bringing up starvation etc in an old fashioned you<br/>
better because people are starving self defeating damaging way..I don&#39;t<br/>
think anything is wrong with teaching global awareness to your children I<br/>
also teach my kids about the war and i don&#39;t do it to hurt and manipulate<br/>
them just to teach him what we are up against growing up in the american<br/>
society we are in unfortunatly some people are too busy trying to figure out<br/>
how not to teach their kids instead of trying to figure out how to give your<br/>
kids the tools to ask questions researxh seek the truth and teach themselves<br/>
I will now happily delete myself from your group ..I prefer john holt, A.s.<br/>
neill and ivan illich  -peace out<br/>

<br/>
Have we not JUST RECENTLY been discussing this?  Maybe I&#39;m thinking  <br/>
of similar stuff at  Unschooling.info.<br/>
<br/>
There was a mom once who came to a list and was supporting spanking,  <br/>
in a very blustery and cavalier way.  She got jumped by other moms.   <br/>
She actually came back and said we had *made her cry.*<br/>
<br/>
Someone who had voluntarily chosen to post that it was okay to spank  <br/>
kids (which I presume makes them cry) whined that adults with  <br/>
opinions about being nicer to children had made her cry.<br/>
<br/>
A very young child does NOT need to know about war and starvation.   <br/>
There can be peace SOMEwhere in the world (at least in the lives of  <br/>
young children outside of war zones)...<br/>
<br/>

without reading a while first, and then jump on us for responding.<br/>
<br/>
We read this list, kinda minding our own business (or minding the  <br/>
business of the list&#39;s purpose) and people come by and voluntarily  <br/>
bare their too-candid souls, but don&#39;t want feedback?!<br/>
<br/>
The good thing is that there are some hundreds of lurking readers who  <br/>
are undecided or unclear who will glean some good stuff from these  <br/>
exchanges and reactions.<br/>

It is a great way to handle household waste and I love worms as<br/>
low-maintenance pets &lt;BWG&gt;. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I went there and it was so fun, I ordered $20 worth of worms.  Then I  <br/>
remembered I&#39;m going to Arizona Friday morning.<br/>
<br/>
So I read some more about that all, and made a worm-home, and a lid  <br/>
for it with a handle, and holes in the bottom and a tray.  And I&#39;ve  <br/>
briefed the kids on what to do if the worms haven&#39;t arrived by  <br/>
Thursday, and to leave a light on so they won&#39;t be tempted to crawl  <br/>
out.  We  have a paper shredder and dirt and so I&#39;ll have their  <br/>
little home all ready for them by the time I leave town.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I really didn&#39;t mean to buy worms this week, and I have THREE compost  <br/>
piles working fine in the yard, but that&#39;s  how life goes when things  <br/>
are exciting.  (It will be fun, and we&#39;ll get quicker soil.)<br/>

container with holes drilled in it, under my kitchen sink. If you take  <br/>
off the lid and cover one side with red cellophane, the worms all go  <br/>
to the covered side and you can see them. That way you can get all the  <br/>
compost out of the uncovered side, without taking out the worms.<br/>
<br/>
After a few years, I decided to dump the whole thing into our big  <br/>
outdoor compost piles. I kept imagining what that was like for the  <br/>
worms, suddenly being out in the wild! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

We just started it with red worms that they sell at bait shops for  <br/>
fishermen around here. Worked great.<br/>

   <br/>
  Because I know he&#39;s like this most of the time, I either serve myself smaller portions, then eat what he didn&#39;t after he&#39;s done.  Works fairly well.  I will also save it for later.  I work on the weekends and take the leftovers to work for lunch and dinner.<br/>
   <br/>
  At times NOT related to mealtime, we do discuss how people in other countries don&#39;t always get a good meal to eat, and I&#39;m thankful that we have plenty.  And we have talked about how my parents used to MAKE us clean our plate, and would make us sit and stare at cold, yukky vegetables for hours, then bring it back out for breakfast if we didn&#39;t eat it.  Just taught me that my mother could be mean (which is what her mother did to her, and her mother&#39;s mother did also).  How I never saw the point, still don&#39;t see the point, and won&#39;t make them do it either.<br/>

she would have to have carrot sticks whenever she watched Mazie the <br/>
Mouse.  If she didn&#39;t have the carrot sticks RIGHT when the part of <br/>
the show came on where Mazzie fed the bunnies carrots, she would have <br/>
a major screaming fit!  We would have to start the ENTIRE movie over <br/>
again and I would have to wait with carrots in hand until that <br/>
particular part started.  She seldom ate but one carrot, but she had <br/>
to have exactly the same amount of carrots as Mazie had!  I&#39;d eat the <br/>
rest or put them in the refrigerator for later.<br/>
<br/>
There was another video, The Hungry Caterpillar, and I would have to <br/>
be ready with apple slices to hand her so that she could eat them at <br/>
exactly the same time the caterpillar in the video did.  BUT they <br/>
couldn&#39;t have any brown spots on them so I had to time exactly when I <br/>
cut them up so that they would be ready, but not brown!  I sure ate <br/>
lots of brown apples during that time period, and sometimes, I just <br/>
put them in the compost pile outside.<br/>
<br/>
She has outgrown that phase.  Soemtimes I look back and actually miss <br/>
those times (she cuts her own apple and carrot slices now) when I <br/>
was &quot;needed&quot; more.  They grow so fast!<br/>

interested in what I was looking at.  She sat down next to me and got <br/>

went to our library&#39;s website.  She looked through the books <br/>
available (she just looks at the picture of the book and has me read <br/>
the title)and had me order the ones she wants.  Also some videos.  <br/>
Then I remembered that I had the Insect Lore catalog and she looked <br/>
through that as well.  I ended up ordering her the Worm Nursery.  <br/>
Hopefully, we&#39;ll get it soon.  <br/>

I like Insect Lore for younger kids, although, Sandra, I&#39;d like to <br/>
know more about how you made your worm home (pictures?). The one we <br/>
ordered will be very small and is basically for raising worms from <br/>
whatever they are as babies to adult then releasing them.  It comes <br/>
with compost, but it would be fun to learn how to make our own <br/>
compost for worms.<br/>

I remembered you having that.<br/>

I made this out of a clear plastic bucket, thinking &quot;Ant Farm.&quot;  I  <br/>
think worms just wander aimlessly and I don&#39;t think they make any  <br/>
rooms or nests, so it won&#39;t be as exciting as ant farms used to be (I  <br/>
used to *LOVE* gallon jars of ants, but when I got older I felt sorry  <br/>
for the ants and quit keeping any locked up).   I figured if  <br/>
sometimes I covered the sides with dark cloth a just peeked sometimes  <br/>
I might get to see some worms against the edges.  I don&#39;t want to  <br/>
cover the whole thing, though, or they might crawl out.  Maybe I&#39;ll  <br/>
make the bucket a dark skirt.  Some drapery. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Keith, Marty and Holly are all amused at my &quot;oops&quot; about ordering  <br/>
when I&#39;m leaving town, and have all agreed to be briefed on what I&#39;ve  <br/>
learned and set up before I leave.  I&#39;m going to put them in an  <br/>
unheated enclosed porch (by the faucet in the sunroom, for those who  <br/>
know my house).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad I can get excited about worms and dirt.  It makes life  <br/>
better for me.<br/>

about<br/>

understand<br/>
&gt; why you care ..you could also teach your child about the world <br/>
around them<br/>
&gt; and that other people are starving maybe that sounds old fashioned <br/>
but<br/>
&gt; research Darfur and show pictures of starving children some who do <br/>
get to<br/>
&gt; eat ONLY  rice or oatmeal ..other than that I would say plan menus <br/>
cook<br/>
&gt; together and don&#39;t open 2 or 3 cans of veggies a day just because <br/>
you are<br/>
&gt; unschool and respecting your kids minds doesn&#39;t mean you have to <br/>
be a<br/>
&gt; &quot;sucker &quot;or a &quot;pushover&quot; talk with your kid like they are a real <br/>

gallons with some small holes drilled into the lid for aeration.  We<br/>
started with some shredded paper, a bit of compost and about 2 dozen<br/>
worms from another person&#39;s bin.  The red worms can eat their own<br/>
weight in food each day (nightcrawlers are lazier and do not eat as<br/>
much).  The bin was going great for two months as we added food scraps<br/>
and paper products daily.  We would check for eggs, baby worms, large<br/>
adults, etc... Noel and I even found two worms mating!!!<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.urbanext.uiuc.edu/worms/anatomy/anatomy11.html">http://www.urbanext.uiuc.edu/worms/anatomy/anatomy11.html</a>  I never<br/>
knew... and we put the lid back on that little adventure.  Anyway, our<br/>
mistake was to give away too many worms and the process came to a<br/>
standstill.  So I have just ordered a pound of worms to get it<br/>
restarted and maybe even use a 20 gallon bin.  The woman I spoke to at<br/>
wormwoman was great and very helpful at &quot;trouble shooting&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
I am not sure about clear plastic - I do not know if they need the<br/>
darkness or if you can just keep it under a sink and then have the<br/>
advantage of seeing in when you want.  I know you have to have a lid<br/>
to help control moisture and keep the little buggers in...<br/>
 <br/>
One mom shared that she would put in whole apples versus cores just to<br/>
see the difference in breakdown.  I put in avocado pits and they take<br/>
months.  They are not supposed to be fond of citrus, onion, or<br/>
broccoli.  Eggshells need to be rinsed and NO meat or dairy - would<br/>
that make them vegans?? <br/>
<br/>
We have a couple of manure piles out back so this is more for fun, but<br/>
apparently you can handle a lot of household waste this way.  <br/>
<br/>
More than enough to get you started....<br/>

that making the switch to frozen veggies helps a bit.<br/>
You can literally make a one or two tablespoon serving<br/>
at a time. If they change their mind, it&#39;s a small<br/>
tasty treat for the dogs ;-) I&#39;ve even been guilty of<br/>
just dumping it back into the family pot in the case<br/>
of rice, oatmeal,etc.<br/>
<br/>
I might also suggest that toddlers are sometimes just<br/>
a bit overwhelmed by too much of anything on the<br/>
plate. I often recommend that parents serve them less<br/>
than they think they might eat, and offer more as<br/>
desired.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve frankly been guilty of the same rather capricious<br/>
change of heart, realizing after making something,<br/>
that it wasn&#39;t at all what I wanted to eat. I guess<br/>
some of us never outgrow that.<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Okay.  In a few days when I set it up I&#39;ll put photos on my blog and  <br/>
&gt; &gt; leave a note here.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; And those of you who&#39;ve done it can coach me.  I&#39;d appreciate advice  <br/>
&gt; &gt; and ideas.  We have lots of room and if the clear plastic thing  <br/>
&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t work or the bucket is too small, we have bigger containers<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; We are using a dark plastic storage bin - probably about 10 or 15<br/>
&gt; gallons with some small holes drilled into the lid for aeration.  We<br/>
&gt; started with some shredded paper, a bit of compost and about 2 dozen<br/>
&gt; worms from another person&#39;s bin.  The red worms can eat their own<br/>
&gt; weight in food each day (nightcrawlers are lazier and do not eat as<br/>
&gt; much).  The bin was going great for two months as we added food scraps<br/>
&gt; and paper products daily.  We would check for eggs, baby worms, large<br/>
&gt; adults, etc... Noel and I even found two worms mating!!!<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.urbanext.uiuc.edu/worms/anatomy/anatomy11.html">http://www.urbanext.uiuc.edu/worms/anatomy/anatomy11.html</a>  I never<br/>
&gt; knew... and we put the lid back on that little adventure.  Anyway, our<br/>
&gt; mistake was to give away too many worms and the process came to a<br/>
&gt; standstill.  So I have just ordered a pound of worms to get it<br/>
&gt; restarted and maybe even use a 20 gallon bin.  The woman I spoke to at<br/>
&gt; wormwoman was great and very helpful at &quot;trouble shooting&quot;.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am not sure about clear plastic - I do not know if they need the<br/>
&gt; darkness or if you can just keep it under a sink and then have the<br/>
&gt; advantage of seeing in when you want.  I know you have to have a lid<br/>
&gt; to help control moisture and keep the little buggers in...<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; One mom shared that she would put in whole apples versus cores just to<br/>
&gt; see the difference in breakdown.  I put in avocado pits and they take<br/>
&gt; months.  They are not supposed to be fond of citrus, onion, or<br/>
&gt; broccoli.  Eggshells need to be rinsed and NO meat or dairy - would<br/>
&gt; that make them vegans?? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We have a couple of manure piles out back so this is more for fun, but<br/>
&gt; apparently you can handle a lot of household waste this way.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; More than enough to get you started....<br/>

&gt; &gt; I would say make your kids meals instead of random canned <br/>
&gt; veggies ..look up<br/>
&gt; &gt; recipes or a kids cookbook and involve your child in choosing <br/>
&gt; recipes and<br/>
&gt; &gt; produce and creating the meals with you also teaching your kids <br/>
&gt; about<br/>
&gt; &gt; managing money making grocery lists and budgeting could help him <br/>
&gt; understand<br/>
&gt; &gt; why you care ..you could also teach your child about the world <br/>
&gt; around them<br/>
&gt; &gt; and that other people are starving maybe that sounds old fashioned <br/>
&gt; but<br/>
&gt; &gt; research Darfur and show pictures of starving children some who do <br/>
&gt; get to<br/>
&gt; &gt; eat ONLY  rice or oatmeal ..other than that I would say plan menus <br/>
&gt; cook<br/>
&gt; &gt; together and don&#39;t open 2 or 3 cans of veggies a day just because <br/>
&gt; you are<br/>
&gt; &gt; unschool and respecting your kids minds doesn&#39;t mean you have to <br/>
&gt; be a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;sucker &quot;or a &quot;pushover&quot; talk with your kid like they are a real <br/>
&gt; person and<br/>
&gt; &gt; tell them how you feel and why ..that is the only way to teach them<br/>
&gt; &gt; awareness of their inpact on their environment and the individuals <br/>
&gt; around<br/>
&gt; &gt; them<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -=-Alot of times my son will ask for a can of corn/carrots or <br/>
&gt; something<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and once we open it he will say I don&#39;t want it after he takes <br/>
&gt; one<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bite. This is all stuff he likes and has eaten before. My dh <br/>
&gt; and I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; feel angry when he does this because he wont eat it later. Not <br/>
&gt; so much<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with the cans mostly angry when he asks for rice or oatmeal, <br/>
&gt; we will<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cook it for him and then say he doesn&#39;t want it. How should we <br/>
&gt; deal<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with this? There are only so many containers the fridge can <br/>
&gt; hold and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they go bad or nobody wants it. We ask him if he&#39;s sure he <br/>
&gt; wants the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; oatmeal and he says yes but changes his mind...why?-=-<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don&#39;t know why, but if you use frozen vegetables you can <br/>
&gt; microwave<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; just a few bites at a time, or he could even eat them frozen, <br/>
&gt; or<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thawed to room temperature. That might be more fun than <br/>
&gt; canned, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ultimately cheaper, too.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If there&#39;s leftover rice or oatmeal, you could freeze it and <br/>
&gt; add it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to something you&#39;re cooking later, or if you have a dog you <br/>
&gt; could add<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something else to it and make dog food.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Stressing over something that costs less than a dollar should<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; probably be compared to the price of one visit to a <br/>
&gt; counsellor, or<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the cost of one day&#39;s worth of medication for high blood <br/>
&gt; pressure.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It&#39;s just not worth the anger.<br/>

(nylon was the recommendation, probably in part I guess because it  <br/>

I think it  might be part of what makes unschooling work.  Maybe we  <br/>
should discuss how to help people get from cynicism and impatience to  <br/>
some sort of &quot;smell the roses&quot; state.  I suppose roses need compost,  <br/>
