<div id="ygrps-yiv-1529821686">Skylar recently joined a Lego Mindstorms &quot;First Lego League&quot; Team. <br/>
I&#39;m haing a few issues and I need some tips in speaking with adults.<br/>
<br/>
It seems that the other mothers in the group, are very controlling. <br/>
At least 2 out of 3.  They are all traditional homeschoolers, and when<br/>
we went to our first meeting the kids sat and built with the robots<br/>
while the moms discussed rules, meetings, structure, blah blah blah. <br/>
I was lucky to have Milo, 3, with me to distract me from their<br/>
ridiculousness.  All I could think was why are we not building with<br/>
our children???  They actually made comments about unschooling,<br/>
organic learning, and how it didn&#39;t work past age 12 and etc.  Ugh.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway...  I don&#39;t know if anyone here has been on an FLL team before<br/>
but these moms, especially the moms of the two girls are dead set on<br/>
following directions to build.  I&#39;m pretty sure that I clearly read<br/>
that the children can design and invent a robot to complete a preset<br/>
groups of tasks.  That they could get lego&#39;s from any source as long<br/>
as they did not incorporate extra motors.  <br/>
<br/>
When I asked why they didn&#39;t think the children should try and learn,<br/>
build, create, design, etc.  They said it would be like &quot;reinventing<br/>
the wheel&quot;.  Dumbfounded....  I didn&#39;t know what to say except &quot;isn&#39;t<br/>
that a good thing?&quot;  I mean what if they have a better wheel???  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d really like to try talking to them, even though it may backfire or<br/>
may not go anywhere.  But Skylar really wants to create and I&#39;m hoping<br/>
for a good experience for him.  If he isn&#39;t aloud to design and create<br/>
and has to follow directions on paper then he&#39;ll probably quit.  Any<br/>
ideas on how to talk to them about this?</div>

I think it&#39;s the difference between arts and crafts.   Art is  <br/>
freeform, and crafts are the creation of something just like the  <br/>
model.  Art is a waste of time and energy, while &quot;crafts projects&quot;  <br/>
lead straight to real-life productivity and the ability to follow  <br/>
directions and not dawdle or expend energy past the minimal  <br/>
requirements.<br/>
<br/>
If an engineer has already designed a working robot, any good, smart  <br/>
kid would just follow those directions and be guaranteed to have a  <br/>
working robot without any messy failure or waste of time.  They&#39;re  <br/>
there for their kids to succeed, and following the directions will be  <br/>
success.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(In the two paragraphs above, except for &quot;I think it&#39;s the difference  <br/>
between arts and crafts,&quot; I was speaking for structure-loving mothers  <br/>
and what kind of justifications they  might have for not wanting  <br/>
&quot;create and design&quot; to be interpretted as &quot;do what you want to do.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
I would say talk to Skylar about what the other moms&#39; thoughts are,  <br/>
and that he might be the only one doing anything other than the basic  <br/>
directions.  Don&#39;t try to change the world to fit him.  Help him  <br/>
understand the world so he can figure out how he wants to fit in and  <br/>
what parts he&#39;d rather avoid.<br/>

OH!  Well that&#39;s different.  It&#39;s not a &quot;majority rules&quot; situation,  <br/>
then.  Pointing out to the whole group that LEGO says this or that is  <br/>
reasonable and necessary then!  I withdraw my other ideas.<br/>

try going to a couple of Odyssy of the Mind meetings.  I think they are <br/>
similiar in that the kids work as a team, create and tackle a problem. <br/>
etc..  They are interested in it and we are going to see how it goes.  <br/>
I was very encouraged when the organizer wrote me and mentioned there <br/>
is a playground at the facility that kids whose loose interest in the <br/>
problems.  The kids are interested in it so off we go.  <br/>
Personally, I thought the idea behind all those kinds of things was to <br/>
encourage creativity.  anyone can just follow directions.</div>

****Is there any way you could have your own team? I&#39;m not sure how many kids are required, but maybe you could find enough that are interested in free form legos to make your own entry.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I hope your lego club is better than the one I tried to create, it fell apart because we are not Christian.  The joys of homeschooling in the buckle of the Bible Belt.<br/>

<br/>
No, it seems to be rare.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes directions are daunting and not well presented.  (I&#39;ve just  <br/>
filled in and mailed an absentee ballot...)<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the directions are simple and people either over- or  <br/>
underthink them.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have learned to follow directions from video gaming.  There&#39;s  <br/>
not room for creativity in the way you play the game itself, the way  <br/>
the controllers respond and that.  There&#39;s no creativity allowed in  <br/>
Karaoke Revolution.  You sing it the way they wanted you to, or you  <br/>
lose points.  There&#39;s a LOT of creativity involved in Photoshop and  <br/>
html coding, both of which Holly knows better and better all the  <br/>
time, but she also knows you have to be precise in the code and in  <br/>
the naming and saving of things.<br/>

freely use a bunch of materials he normally doesn&#39;t have access to, or the <br/>
experience of being part of a group. If the latter, I guess he has to decide <br/>
if the following instructions part is worth it.<br/>
<br/>
There have been times, especially in crafting situations, when I have acted <br/>
as a shield between Jayn and the instructor by just saying simply and <br/>
quietly to that person, &quot;Jayn&#39;s just going to do this over here, I think&quot; <br/>
with a pleasant smile and some nods. It&#39;s not trying to change the <br/>
experience for everyone else. It&#39;s letting the instructor know that she is <br/>
free from needing to attend to Jayn. It&#39;s allowing Jayn her free choice. <br/>
Usually Jayn would be way ahead of the rest of the group in the making. So <br/>
far this has always been met with a pleasant reaction and the other person <br/>
backing off.<br/>
<br/>
Without knowing the exact structure of this event (sounds like what Jayn <br/>
would want to avoid) perhaps it would work just to separate yourself and <br/>
Skylar slightly, if he was agreeable, to say to anyone who asked, &quot;We&#39;re <br/>
just going to work on something over here for a while.&quot; Then perhaps rejoin <br/>
the team later. Is it one giant team of everyone? Are there no other kids <br/>
that could be on &quot;Skylar&#39;s experimenting team&quot; freeing the instruction <br/>
followers to be on their own team?<br/>
<br/>
I remember having lego windmill as a child. It had very complex <br/>
instructions. For me finally being able to follow the plan and produce the <br/>
working windmill in the end (without any leftover pieces!) was an <br/>
achievement. A different sort of achievement from creating something of my <br/>
own from scratch, and different again from deducing the process from <br/>
examining the finished product. I think there&#39;s room for all of these <br/>
experiences.<br/>
<br/>
If all else fails, can you start your own unschooling chapter of the club?<br/>

<br/>
All very good ideas.  Most don&#39;t fit with the particular situation. <br/>
there is only 1 robot.  But still really good ideas to think about in<br/>
the future.  <br/>
<br/>
I got a phone call late in the day yesterday.  Oddly enough, the two<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1277008258">My daughters were on an all girl Lego League. There were several other<br/>
teams that all worked through the technical parts together and then<br/>
the five girls (it&#39;s generally very male dominated) said that they<br/>
were tired of fighting with the boys because the boys did not want to<br/>
cooperate. The instructor then asked the girls if they wanted to form<br/>
an all girls team. The children programmed the robots to perform the<br/>
commands within the time limit that they have and the girls actually<br/>
wound up winning at the competition because the judges were so<br/>
impressed by how they worked together and encouraged one another as a<br/>
team. (I&#39;m getting teary-eyed remembering this). For my girls, the<br/>
experience was two-fold: they enjoyed the challenges of robotics, but<br/>
they relished the opportunity to work cooperatively with a group of<br/>
girls on something scientific. They never asked to do Lego League<br/>
again, and we are all satisfied with the memories and experience. I<br/>
agree that Skylar will let you know what&#39;s most important to him, and<br/>
whether his needs are being met by this group. If not, perhaps he can<br/>
just have fun creating and programming the robot and next year you can<br/>
gather a band of unschoolers who more closely share your philosophy. <br/>
<br/>
Sounds like he&#39;s having a good time though. I know that sometimes our<br/>
objectives as parents aren&#39;t the same as our children&#39;s objectives.<br/>
The arts center where my daughter takes some really creative and<br/>
interesting classes is WAY to serious and structured for my liking.<br/>
The owners are a wealthy couple, who have deep ties and deeper pockets<br/>
in the arts community here. The head mistress was a professional<br/>
dancer in her day, and brings the type of discipline that I imagine a<br/>
prima ballerina would need. But what a prima ballerina needs, an 8<br/>
year old does not. I often want to tell them to take a flying leap,<br/>
but my daughter enjoys the classes and doesn&#39;t even seem to pay<br/>
attention to the &quot;rants and raves&quot; of the administrators. I&#39;ve learned<br/>
to keep my mouth shut, because the administrators aren&#39;t harmful, just<br/>
annoying. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1356825139">My son did FLL for two years. There were two of us mothers as coaches, but we really did very little except guide the kids through the administrative steps of the process--the research, presentation, poster and T-shirts. The group decision-making needed a lot of motherly guidance, too!<br/>
<br/>
Neither of us understood how to do the programming, and the kids were just fine with that. We were shocked at the competition when we saw parents doing all the last-minute tweaking while the kids stood by and watched!<br/>
<br/>
Has the theme of the competition been announced yet? Do you have the plan for the playing field? There really is no pre-written guide to follow for solving the various challenges--the kids must invent ways to do that.<br/>
<br/>
Working through pre-designed models might be a useful way to learn the basics of how the programming and the robot work. But at some point, the kids are going to have to invent their own things.<br/>
<br/>
Something we learned is that the scoring depends on much more than just whether the robot succeeds in the tasks. The research project and HOW it is presented is a big factor in the point totals, as is general presentation of the whole team--poster, t-shirt, matching hair ribbons (our team was all boys and they didn&#39;t care about any of this!). <br/>
<br/>
Especially important was an ability to answer questions from the judges and show an awareness of what each kid did as an individual and as part of the team. Our boys described days of research as: &quot;We went to the library a few times and got some books.&quot; The other coach-mom and I just groaned on the other side of the door! But their robot completed all the tasks, and they were happy with that. They didn&#39;t advance in the competition; when we explained to them what they&#39;d have to do to win, they weren&#39;t interested! They just wanted to build and program the robot.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-747110273">&lt;&lt;My 2 oldest (5 and 7) are going to try going to a couple of Odyssy of <br/>
the Mind meetings. I think they are similiar in that the kids work as a <br/>
team, create and tackle a problem. etc.. They are interested in it and <br/>
we are going to see how it goes. I was very encouraged when the <br/>
organizer wrote me and mentioned there is a playground at the facility <br/>
that kids whose loose interest in the problems. The kids are interested <br/>
in it so off we go. Personally, I thought the idea behind all those <br/>
kinds of things was to encourage creativity. anyone can just follow <br/>
directions. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One of the &quot;rules&quot; of Odyssey of the Mind is that if the directions <br/>
don&#39;t say you can&#39;t... you can.  <br/>
When the kids asked, &quot;But can we...&quot;<br/>
I repeated, &quot;You can if you can and it doesn&#39;t say you can&#39;t.  (I <br/>
coached a school-based team, so the kids were used to hearing about what <br/>
they can&#39;t do, shouldn&#39;t do.)<br/>
The OM problems have all sorts of specific directions.  Some are to keep <br/>
the competition fair and to make process the work; &quot;Presentations are to <br/>
be under 8 minutes.&quot; Or &quot;Build a structure out of balsa wood that will <br/>
hold weight.  Use only wood glue.  The structure will be penalized 1 <br/>
point for every gram over 15 grams.&quot;  Some of the directions seem <br/>
arbitrary but are just part of the game.  &quot;Your skit will depict at <br/>
least three times periods other than the present time.&quot; <br/>
OM was one of my gateway experiences towards unschooling... long before <br/>
I had children of my own.  I saw what kids would/could do when the reins <br/>
were less tight.  When the spirit of the coach is towards exploration, <br/>
creativity, team work, FUN, then OM is a great game to play.<br/>
