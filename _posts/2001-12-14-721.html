&gt; &gt;folks thought about what if your kids are gay or lesbian?  When you talk to<br/>
&gt; &gt;them about potential mates or futures, do you use exclusively heterosexual<br/>
&gt; &gt;terms?  Would it bother you if your child WERE gay or lesbian.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It wouldn&#39;t bother me at all.  But I have wondered just how to bring it up <br/>
&gt; in a way that says I don&#39;t expect that you are gay but it wouldn&#39;t bother <br/>
&gt; me if you were.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, in our family it&#39;s pretty casual, because Julian&#39;s moms are lebians and <br/>
his dad is straight.  It&#39;s sort of lying around the house.<br/>
<br/>
I have a good friend named Emily who&#39;s sixteen and is the daughter of  <br/>
another friend. Kathleen and David (Emily&#39;s parents) have made conscious <br/>
decisions NOT to assume their kids are straight. Kathleen told me this story: <br/>
 Last year Emily was talking about these two kids she&#39;d met, one male and one <br/>
female, that she&#39;d immediately liked a lot. Kathleen, in good-matured-Mom <br/>
teasing, asked if she&#39;d LIKED the boy. Em shrugged. THEN she asked if she&#39;d <br/>
LIKED the girl, and Em blushed and smiled. I thought that was great...in the <br/>
course of natural Mom-banter she&#39;d given Em the mesage it was okay WHOEVER <br/>
she liked. <br/>
<br/>
Emily thought about homeschooling last year but decided to stick with school, <br/>
 partly because she&#39;d helped to found the Gay/Straight Alliance at school.<br/>
<br/>
One more story: Other friends have a son named Gabe, and the whole family was <br/>
waiting from mid-adolescence for Gabe to come out...It was SO obvious! So, <br/>
the parents, grandparents and siblings were all anxious, because they wanted <br/>
to join PFLAG!  He finally got around to coming out when he was 23. And was <br/>
shocked when everyone&#39;s reaction was...&quot;Duh!&quot;<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m sure your right about that. The stigma surrounding being gay or lesbian is very intense. Everybody wants to be admired, respected, and accepted and being gay or lesbian ultimately means being marginalized and disrespected by a significant portion of our society.<br/>
<br/>
When my closest friend left her husband the doctor for Mary-Ann, the magnificent basketball playing physical education instructor, she saw her social status plummet. People she had known for years passed her in the street shooting her a stern glance and turning the other way. Many of her lesbian and gay friends remain in the proverbial closet trying to maintain their dignity. This includes a principle of a Catholic school and the coach of a national basketball team. The support of friends and loved ones is great but unfortunately this does not change the reality of the general public attitude. <br/>
<br/>
Boys are especially harsh in this regard! Being called gay is the #1 cut up in the school yard today. When a kid called my son gay boy in the fifth grade and I told the teacher and principle and they nonchalantly told me that the boys were not aware of the meaning! If they called a girl a slut etc...they would have faced a mandatory suspension! <br/>

I think it&#39;s very judgmental for one to assume that another is unaware of their motivations, desires, personal choices etc.. I&#39;m afraid the roots of prejudice are found in such musings on the lives of others. There is a lot more to sexuality than straight or gay sex. It&#39;s doesn&#39;t have to be one or the other. I often wonder what the world of sex , relationships and family life would look like if we weren&#39;t programmed from such a limited Judean- Christian perspective.

Perhaps so, but we have a friend who, when he said &quot;I&#39;ve joined the Navy!&quot; <br/>
the WHOLE of his friend-pool said &quot;WHAT!??&quot;  And guess what?  They discharged <br/>
him within months.  <br/>
<br/>
And now he&#39;s living in full &quot;gay life style&quot; (and owes me $75 for part of his <br/>
move to &#39;another city&#39; to do this).  But before he left he truly thought he <br/>
was a straight guy.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody else did.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;There is a lot more to sexuality than straight or gay sex. It&#39;s doesn&#39;t <br/>

<br/>
Quite true, but this guy was, as genders go, not on the male end of the scale <br/>
physically or tempermentally and that was obvious to every straight and gay <br/>
friend of mine who ever commented to me, and there were lots, because I had <br/>
an SCA student/teacher (once removed; complex) and musicial-performance <br/>
relationship with him and was a mentor in a couple of ways.  <br/>

Lots of situations are NOT obvious or extreme.  This one was.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-124004229">Perhaps we were somewhwat judgemental in our college days (my friends and<br/>
I).  We&#39;re all still friends ...or try to be.  One of the guys I referred to<br/>
married a wonderful lady and they have a beautiful happy family with four<br/>
adopted children.  Knowing him and his family and the hapiness they share<br/>
has brought us all deeper in knowledge that a person&#39;s mannerisms,  speech<br/>
patterns, etc,  may not tell us all we think it does about sexuality.  The<br/>
other one seems to have disappeared from our regular social gatherings.  He<br/>
and his wife were both part of our college group of friends.<br/>
 I apologize if this cames across as crass or shallow.  We (my friends and<br/>
I) have all been able to talk about it openly and accect each other and our<br/>
life decisions....and grow in knowledge and awe of the mystery of life and<br/>
human behavior.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a lot of current research that says you have to look at two different <br/>
issues when considering &quot;orientation.&quot;  One is Sexual Orientation -- where <br/>
you fall on the Kinsey scale about who you&#39;re attracted to. <br/>
<br/>
The other is Gender Identification.  This is where a lot of Transgendered <br/>
people fall.  Even if they are not inclined to have sex reassignment surgery <br/>
or other treatment, they may feel more identified with the other gender. This <br/>
is where you get the girl who doesn&#39;t outgrow being a &quot;tomboy&quot; or a <br/>
feminine-seeming boy.<br/>
<br/>
The research seems to be showing that these are separate issues. Sometimes <br/>
you&#39;ll get a feminine-identified guy who is straight, sometimes gay. Same for <br/>
girls.<br/>

  I presume Gay men aren&#39;t allowed in the US Navy but Gay men can have a sincere desire to join the navy, no?  <br/>
<br/>
  .......And now he&#39;s living in full &quot;gay life style&quot;......... <br/>
<br/>
  Again, I guess you mean he has sex with men exclusively? But I think a gay life style incorporates all of what a straight lifestyle might entail. Relationships, work, shopping, eating, grooming, going to the theatre, movies, concerts, galleries, including raising a family and kinky sex etc..! What are the details, other than sexual orientation, that one might ascribe particularly to gay men or lesbian women that preclude a &quot;full gay life style&quot;. The lesbian women on this list are raising children, living a family life like the rest of us, being mothers. Are you thinking about promiscuous sexual activity? I&#39;m sure you know that heterosexual people also engage in this kind of activity. <br/>
<br/>
  .........(But before he left he truly thought he was a straight guy.).........<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair or appropriate to assume what he &quot;truly&quot; thought, even if he espoused such information himself. None of us are privy to what another&#39;s truly thinking, there is always a subtext. The way we present ourselves to others is influenced by so many experiences and assumptions that may often be at odds with who we actually are,  wish we were, or hope to become.<br/>
<br/>
  .........Nobody else did..................<br/>
<br/>
  This is my point! A person does not have to be actually told what others are thinking about them to be aware that there is an attitude of prevailing assumption and insinuation involved in their relationships. Gossip is never really a private matter, that&#39;s basically why it&#39;s such a negative behavior. Those being gossiped about are eventually negatively impacted. At some point the person your describing would have become aware of his image in the eyes of his peers and would have been compelled to try to adjust his image and or attempt to influence the way he was being perceived. Being a male, perceived as feminine or gay, is about as negative as it gets for a man in our society. I don&#39;t doubt that he may have truly wanted to believe he was someone else and that he tried to be the consummate man that his penis entitles him to be. <br/>
<br/>
  ..........but this guy was, as genders go, not on the male end of the scale physically or tempermentally and that was obvious to every straight and gay friend of mine who ever commented to me, and there were lots, because I had <br/>

<br/>
  Male and female stereotyping is what sets the stage for modeling role appropriation as adults. Is a father who cuddles his children, takes an active role in raising his kids, does laundry, cooks, grocery shops, cleans the house, stays at home with the kids while mom goes out to work, matches his shirt with his socks etc., displaying feminine behaviors. Is a woman or girl who likes to skateboard, play sports, hates dresses, doesn&#39;t wear make-up, doesn&#39;t want children, hates shopping malls etc., displaying male behaviors. <br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m just suggesting that we are all so immersed in our culture and have inevitably been brainwashed over the years in so many ways, really every way, and that we should always be vigilant to expose our prejudices and continually reevaluate and examine our world views. We are all, on this list, very diligent when it comes to education and critical analysis of schools and curriculum models and we need to apply this vigilance to all aspects of our lives including sexual stereotyping and gender identification especially as it applies to the perpetuation or bigotry.  <br/>

I&#39;m sure I do.<br/>
No, I was thinking about joining gay support groups and going to gay bars and <br/>
having gay friends and subscribing to gay magazines and identifying himself <br/>
openly and publickly as gay to where his retired-military father disowned <br/>
him.  (That joining the Navy just didn&#39;t take, as an attempt to please his <br/>

Judging from conversations and commentary.  <br/>
<br/>
As far as I could tell, he truly thought...<br/>

didn&#39;t thrill his dad.  And despite the feedback he probably received there, <br/>
his homosexuality surprised him when he relaxed into it.<br/>

As far as I can tell.  According to things he said.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;... and we need to apply this vigilance to all aspects of our lives <br/>

<br/>
I think there&#39;s enough evidence these days to support the notion that <br/>
homosexuality is a biologically initiated preference, not the result of <br/>
insufficient or inadequate parenting, exposure to gay Scout leaders before <br/>
the age of 10, or excess red dye #40.<br/>
<br/>
There are too many heterosexual men who would put their relationships with <br/>
their fathers in the ungood category for me to take this seriously.  Nor the <br/>
overbearing mom theory.  Nor the stance that homosexual men and women are so <br/>
because they are damaged.<br/>
<br/>
Good grief.  I had no father, a sexually abusive step-father, a distant <br/>
mother, and I&#39;m still heterosexual, pay my taxes, and am kind to animals and <br/>
children.  What&#39;s with that?  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
My friend, Patrick, has a good relationship with his dad (he&#39;s needed it).  <br/>
He has a brother and a sister who are heterosexual.  He is ... a good human <br/>
being.  He&#39;s warm and kind with my kids -- and with me -- and during this <br/>
past year of really hard relationship issues, he&#39;s been an absolute rock.  <br/>
He&#39;s learned how to be a rock, because coming out as a homosexual man in this <br/>
culture has burned and honed and cleansed his certitude about morality and <br/>
how we treat one another.  He&#39;s learned the value of compassion and courage <br/>
in the face of amazing rudeness and meaness at the hands of people who <br/>
generally celebrate kindness as a virtue.  It&#39;s an odd world.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway.  Sharing interests is nice.  It&#39;s a bond.  But it can&#39;t be forced <br/>
either direction as insurance, I wouldn&#39;t think.  I&#39;ve seen my kids&#39; father <br/>
at the ballet....it&#39;s not something I&#39;d wish on anyone else ;-)<br/>

lives -- and Dobson is wrong about that. Being gay is not because of absent <br/>
or uninvolved fathers, or bad mothering. The childhood experiences of gay men <br/>
span everything from Traditional 50&#39;s style families to single parent <br/>
families, with caring, loving parents to abusive parents. Just like <br/>
heterosexual children.<br/>

useful things to say....BUT  I rarely listen to or read anything of his<br/>
because I think he uses his title as *doctor* to espouse much of his<br/>
personal opinion as fact.  And I often disagree with these unsubstantiated<br/>
opinions.<br/>
    This seems to presume homosexuality is a choice and it&#39;s a parent&#39;s<br/>
responsibility to prevent it somehow.  It doesn&#39;t even allow for the<br/>
&quot;biological error&quot; idea that Laura Schlessinger promotes(another who I think<br/>

actually have to share the same interests, but the parent needs to *value* <br/>
the child&#39;s interests and make an effort to support and facilitate those <br/>
interests.<br/>

<br/>
Not enough to change the minds of those who care more what the Bible says.<br/>
<br/>
But people pick and choose what of the Bible they will believe and cling to <br/>
and live by, no matter what any fundamentalist says.  NONE of them go by the <br/>
whole Bible.  <br/>
<br/>
There are more prohibitions against usury in the Bible than against <br/>
homosexuality by far, but how many Christian families are adamant about not <br/>
using banks or savings and loans?  There are, instead, churches that teach <br/>
that faith in God will make you financially successful.   <br/>
<br/>
The reason there are so many different denominations and sects of <br/>
fundamentalists (the number has grown steadily since the first protestants <br/>
left Europe) is that different congregations choose to focus on different <br/>
Biblical principles, some of the congregation gets offended, starts <br/>
fundraising (probably buying bonds or something else based on usury to make <br/>
the money safer and to collect some interest) and builds their own church, <br/>
with its own focus, which will offend its own future members one way or <br/>
another.<br/>
