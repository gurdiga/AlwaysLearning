&quot;The function of the child is to live his own life - not the life that his<br/>
anxious parents think he should live, nor the life according to the purpose<br/>
of the educator who thinks he knows what is best. All of this interference<br/>
and guidance on the part of adults only produces a generation of robots.&quot;<br/>
