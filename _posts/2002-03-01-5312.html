We used to watch a show on Animal Planet called &quot;Once Upon a Hamster&quot;. My kids and I really enjoyed watching it and it featured Hammy the Hamster. It is off the air now, though. I&#39;m not sure why. But I found the Hammy the Hamster website! &lt;g&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hammyhamster.com/">http://www.hammyhamster.com/</a><br/>

Have those of you with small mammals in your homes (besides the children, I<br/>
mean) read &quot;I, Houdini&quot;?  It&#39;s by Lynn Reid Banks and we have the audio<br/>
version which is read by her.  It&#39;s great!  Told from the hamsters POV, all<br/>
about the great adventures he has while escaped from his cage.<br/>
