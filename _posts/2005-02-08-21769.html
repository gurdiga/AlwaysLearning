<div id="ygrps-yiv-866735661">Hello everybody, <br/>
<br/>
I need your lights about something I don&#39;t understand, with Tom. <br/>
I wrote here a few weeks ago, about watching tv when children want, I&#39;m discovering &quot;unschooling&quot; slowly but surely... So, I try to change how we live at home, with more freedom for Tom and Lilou. <br/>
I was very happy, because here, things were going like some of you said, or like I read on articles. Tom can watch tv for long time, and going after, and doing other things. He&#39;s asking questions again, want to write things (normaly, he doesn&#39;t like it at all !). All those things he stopped one and a half year ago, because of pressure. He&#39;s enthusiastic again...<br/>
He&#39;s more &quot;zen&quot;, somewhere... <br/>
But, now, there&#39;s something really disturbing and worrying for me. Now, for everything, he says &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;. For everything ! He doesn&#39;t know if he&#39;s hungry, he doesn&#39;t know if he needs to go to the toilets, he doesn&#39;t know if he&#39;s thirsty, if he likes that or that. It&#39;s really worrying, because he doesn&#39;t eat anything, because he doesn&#39;t know... Now, it&#39;s since about two weeks he&#39;s like this. And he&#39;s not playing with us on this topic, because it&#39;s something which is really making us so, so angry ! Can&#39;t he feel what are his needs, for his own body ?? <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling about all the life is new for us, but it&#39;s something we can deeply feel, it&#39;s not just a new recipe, or something like this. We really feel it&#39;s something &quot;true&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
 I feel so angry about that ! So angry... what happens ? Is it this new little more freedom which is disturbing him ? Does he test us and our new vison of life ? Did some of you have the same react to new unschooling ? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading me<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
This is part of trusting. Trust that, for now, he really doesn&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
Since this is new, his not knowing is a symptom of something else. Getting<br/>
angry at the symptom won&#39;t make the cause go away. (And it won&#39;t help him be<br/>
more happy!)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is it this new little more freedom which is disturbing him ?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Any change is disturbing, even good change.<br/>
<br/>
Some time after communism fell in the USSR some people in Russia said they<br/>
liked the old ways better because now they had too many choices. Under<br/>
communism they were taken care of and many decisions made for them.<br/>
<br/>
Going from being told what to do next to being able to choose anything you<br/>
want can be overwhelming.<br/>
<br/>
Help him :-) Give him two choices sometimes. Set up a trip and just go.<br/>
Instead of asking if he&#39;s hungry, ask him if he wants cheddar or provolone<br/>
on his sandwich.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Does he test us <br/>

*If* he&#39;s testing you it&#39;s because he is uncertain and needs the answer.<br/>

store.<br/>

******************************* Yes, I know that. But I can&#39;t control it. And I think I can&#39;t control it because I don&#39;t understand it. It&#39;s something bas with me that when I&#39;m not understanding something with the children, it makes me feel angry. <br/>
<br/>

**************************** Yes, it&#39;s what we do. We don&#39;t ask him if he&#39;s hungry. We are just eating, and give him food when he says he&#39;s hungry. And he have several choices. It was ok, and now it&#39;s not anymore...<br/>
<br/>
*If* he&#39;s testing you it&#39;s because he is uncertain and needs the answer.<br/>
************************ But there are lots of questions he&#39;s the one who knows... Like toilets, or hunger, or if he likes something or not. <br/>
<br/>
Have you guys been inside a lot this winter? Or stuck in a routine?<br/>
************************  We live in mountains, lot of snow, he&#39;s skiing, going outside and play in the snow. But less than before, because he&#39;s watching more tv for the moment. <br/>
<br/>
If that&#39;s so I&#39;d suggest you find some new things to do. Get out of the<br/>
house. Go places. Even little changes will help like exploring a new grocery<br/>
store.<br/>
********************* When I go, he doesn&#39;t want to come. Before we change our vues, he didn&#39;t has the choice, but now, he has, and he prefer stay at home. And when we go to friends house, it&#39;s the same, if we stay 3 days, he will not eat &quot;anything&quot; for 3 days. Except candies.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Bring food to him. Ask if he&#39;d like to do some cooking.<br/>
************* I do it. But he doesn&#39;t know...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your answer, joyce<br/>

stop asking him so many questions. If he doesn&#39;t WANT the fruit and <br/>

I think he feels pressured to make too many choices for himself and <br/>
that scares him.<br/>
<br/>
But - I&#39;m more worried about why you&#39;d be angry with him over it - <br/>
sounds like it is because he&#39;s not living up to YOUR ideal of what <br/>
unschooling ought to be like.<br/>

If he had say those things before the changing, I could understand, because we were surrely too much of everything ! But why just now that we feel that &quot;unschooling&quot; is something so great..?<br/>

live your life Sylvie and let him live his. One idea is to make statements<br/>
rather than questions, and then leave it at that. If you make a statement<br/>
like, &quot;I&#39;m going to make a sandwich. Peanut butter and jelly is my favorite&quot;<br/>
then be quiet and make a sandwich. Kids tend to respond better to statements<br/>
when given time to think rather than to a barrage of questions. And if he<br/>
doesn&#39;t respond, move on. Have the food available, or even offer it to him.<br/>
Feed yourself. Enjoy the food and if you are inspired, say what you like<br/>
about the sandwich. If you lay off him and enjoy your own experience, he<br/>
will have both the space he seems to need and the example of you enjoying<br/>
life.<br/>

He is smart enough to not die of starvation. No kid has done that yet who<br/>
had food available.<br/>

you&#39;ll only add your junk to his space. Take a deep breath, love your son,<br/>
appreciate where he is right now, and give him nothing but positive, happy<br/>
energy. This alone will probably help him immensely.<br/>

Oh Sylvie, I think I understand now. It sounds like he is saying these<br/>
statements on his own...like &quot;I don&#39;t know if I am hungry or if I want to go<br/>
to the toilet&quot;, rather than you asking him all these questions. If that is<br/>
the case, then it sounds like he is getting used to the freedom you have<br/>

and it can take quite a while to adjust to being the king of his own<br/>
universe. I like the idea given previously...do something new or different,<br/>
or bring out a game to play. You can offer ideas of your own into<br/>
unschooling, as long as you don&#39;t force it on anyone. Sometimes the kids<br/>
will want to do it and sometimes they won&#39;t. It seems like he may just feel<br/>

&lt;&lt; And he&#39;s not playing with us on this topic, because it&#39;s something which <br/>
is really making us so, so angry ! Can&#39;t he feel what are his needs, for his <br/>
own body ??  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why is his body making you angry?<br/>
<br/>
If he doesn&#39;t know, he doesn&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
An easier question than &quot;Are you hungry?&quot; is &quot;Do you want some grapes?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And why do you care if he&#39;s hungry anyway?  If he IS hungry, I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll <br/>
know.  And if he&#39;s not hungry, don&#39;t try to feed him.<br/>
<br/>
If food is available to him when he wants to eat, he shouldn&#39;t need to decide <br/>
and declare whether he&#39;s hungry at all steps along the way.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I feel so angry about that ! So angry... what happens ? Is it this new <br/>
little more freedom which is disturbing him ?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m surprised at your anger.  Were you used to telling him when to eat and go <br/>
to the bathroom, so it bothers you that he&#39;s not telling you when to tell him <br/>
to, or not reporting to you so you can provide food or bathrooms?  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe he is just trying to decide what real &quot;hungry&quot; feels like, and so he <br/>
doesn&#39;t know the answer to your question.   Let him not know.  You can&#39;t make <br/>
him know.   Maybe he&#39;s just simply being honest, that he&#39;s not sure.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he&#39;s getting old enough that he doesn&#39;t want your involvement so much <br/>
anymore in whether he needs the toilet or not.  <br/>
<br/>
Put food out and when he&#39;s hungry he will eat.<br/>
<br/>
Also, maybe he has some slight illness and honestly isn&#39;t hungry.  Maybe his <br/>
body is letting the germs or whatever pass through and meanwhile he&#39;s NOT <br/>
hungry.  That has happened to me lots of times.   <br/>

&lt;&lt; Yes, I know that. But I can&#39;t control it.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you n&#39;t learn to control your responses to your children&#39;s normal be<br/>
Zhaviors, unschooling might not be best for them.<br/>
<br/>
You MUST learn to control your anger.<br/>
<br/>
Breathing deep breaths helps.  Looking at the sky, breathing slowly, thinking <br/>
lovely thoughts can help.   Smelling your baby&#39;s head can help.  Looking at <br/>
photos from when they were infants will help.  Finding some things to say to <br/>
yourself about peace and joy and love might help.<br/>
<br/>
Telling yourself and all of us that you can&#39;t help it will not help.<br/>

<br/>
************************ But there are lots of questions he&#39;s the one who <br/>
knows... -=-<br/>
<br/>
And if he&#39;s the only one who NEEDS to know, maybe it&#39;s none of your business.<br/>
<br/>
Let him have more privacy, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
When you go to visit friends, maybe take some of the foods he likes best at <br/>
home in case he gets hungry but doesn&#39;t like food cooked at other people&#39;s <br/>
houses.  When I was little, I had a hard time with sandwiches that had any <br/>
unfamiliar bread or spreads.  I couldn&#39;t eat eggs cooked at other houses because they <br/>
tasted funny.  I grew out of it, but I was maybe fifteen years old before <br/>
that went away.<br/>

<br/>
Oh!<br/>
Maybe he wants you to talk to him about what &quot;hungry&quot; feels like or what the <br/>
various symptoms of needing the toilet might be before you get to the &quot;HAVE TO <br/>
GO NOW!<br/>
 moment.<br/>
<br/>
Holly used to ask me, whens he was already about nine years old, about what <br/>
it felt like to be sleepy, and how do people fall asleep.  She takes a long <br/>
time to go to sleep, but until we discussed it I didn&#39;t know she didn&#39;t realize <br/>
that to try to go to sleep, people close their eyes and breathe shallowly.<br/>
<br/>
I remember saying some things that I thought she would already know, like &quot;If <br/>
it feels better to lie down than to sit up, you&#39;re probably sleepy.&quot;  That&#39;s <br/>
the kind of conversation she really wanted, the discussion of what kinds of <br/>
signals or symptoms people considered to be &quot;sleepy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So maybe Tom wants you to say &quot;If food doesn&#39;t look good, you&#39;re probably not <br/>
hungry,&quot; or &quot;sometimes when people are really hungry their stomachs make <br/>
little noises.&quot;<br/>

Relax Sylvie &lt;grin&gt;.  It is quite possible that your son is having to <br/>

external restrictions but truly finding out his own feelings about things.<br/>
<br/>
I know it can be infuriating.  I tend to not have strong preferences about <br/>
most things, so when asked, will often respond, &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t <br/>

<br/>
You might try, in your head, to change your son&#39;s words around.  When he <br/>
says &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;, try to hear that he is telling you &quot;I don&#39;t have real <br/>
strong feelings either way right now.  But that might change later.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Hello everybody,<br/>
<br/>
I need your lights about something I don&#39;t understand, with Tom.<br/>
I wrote here a few weeks ago, about watching tv when children want, I&#39;m <br/>
discovering &quot;unschooling&quot; slowly but surely... So, I try to change how we <br/>
live at home, with more freedom for Tom and Lilou.<br/>
I was very happy, because here, things were going like some of you said, or <br/>
like I read on articles. Tom can watch tv for long time, and going after, <br/>
and doing other things. He&#39;s asking questions again, want to write things <br/>
(normaly, he doesn&#39;t like it at all !). All those things he stopped one and <br/>
a half year ago, because of pressure. He&#39;s enthusiastic again...<br/>
He&#39;s more &quot;zen&quot;, somewhere...<br/>
But, now, there&#39;s something really disturbing and worrying for me. Now, for <br/>
everything, he says &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;. For everything ! He doesn&#39;t know if he&#39;s <br/>
hungry, he doesn&#39;t know if he needs to go to the toilets, he doesn&#39;t know if <br/>
he&#39;s thirsty, if he likes that or that. It&#39;s really worrying, because he <br/>
doesn&#39;t eat anything, because he doesn&#39;t know... Now, it&#39;s since about two <br/>
weeks he&#39;s like this. And he&#39;s not playing with us on this topic, because <br/>
it&#39;s something which is really making us so, so angry ! Can&#39;t he feel what <br/>
are his needs, for his own body ??<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling about all the life is new for us, but it&#39;s something we can <br/>
deeply feel, it&#39;s not just a new recipe, or something like this. We really <br/>
feel it&#39;s something &quot;true&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 I feel so angry about that ! So angry... what happens ? Is it this new <br/>
little more freedom which is disturbing him ? Does he test us and our new <br/>
vison of life ? Did some of you have the same react to new unschooling ?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading me<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-261289519">Sandra<br/>
<br/>
And why do you care if he&#39;s hungry anyway? <br/>
**************** Because he&#39;s so thin ! So thin ! <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m surprised at your anger.  Were you used to telling him when to eat and go <br/>
to the bathroom, so it bothers you that he&#39;s not telling you when to tell him <br/>
to, or not reporting to you so you can provide food or bathrooms?  <br/>
************** No, not at all... It&#39;s because before we start unschooling, he knew without us asking him, when he was hungry or not, he was going to the bathroom alone, without saying anything. This is now we say &quot;yes&quot; for other things like tv, or pc or eating in front of tv, or all those little things that we were saying &quot;no&quot; before, he doesn&#39;t know anymore for his body. <br/>
And I really think anger can&#39;t be control like this... And talking about it to all of you and to my friend at the phone helped me a lot. I feel a lot better with all the answers I had, and it helped me to stand back and see the topics with other eyes...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he&#39;s getting old enough that he doesn&#39;t want your involvement so much <br/>
anymore in whether he needs the toilet or not.  <br/>
****************** I&#39;m not involved anymore... He knew before, and he doesn&#39;t know anymore...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And if he&#39;s the only one who NEEDS to know, maybe it&#39;s none of your business.<br/>
*************** Yes, it&#39;s what I try to say. I know for a long time it&#39;s not my business.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Let him have more privacy, maybe.<br/>
************** That&#39;s what we do now... The &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; came in the same time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When you go to visit friends, maybe take some of the foods he likes best at <br/>
home<br/>
************** The thing is for the moment, he almost doesn&#39;t like anything, even what he loved before... Honestly, if I want to take something he likes, I don&#39;t know what... He really doesn&#39;t eat by now... <br/>
<br/>
Maybe he wants you to talk to him about what &quot;hungry&quot; feels like or what the <br/>
various symptoms of needing the toilet might be before you get to the &quot;HAVE TO <br/>
GO NOW!<br/>
************************** Oh ! I didn&#39;t think about that... Because those topics were not problems for him before... He knew when he was hungry or need to go to the toilets without us need to ask him at all... This is what is disturbing me... He knew before, and now he doesn&#39;t anymore... Can he forget because of more freedom ? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So maybe Tom wants you to say &quot;If food doesn&#39;t look good, you&#39;re probably not <br/>
hungry,&quot; or &quot;sometimes when people are really hungry their stomachs make <br/>
little noises.&quot;<br/>
********************** Yes.. I will try... <br/>
<br/>

***************************** It was both... Angry and frustrated. I need to understand things... Maybe it&#39;s not a good thing, but I&#39;m like that. I need to understand. And I&#39;m sure it&#39;s with my chilhood too. Something about this is coming when Tom is reacting like that. My needs were not respected at all, and it&#39;s  make it coming out. And I work hard on it, I&#39;m don&#39;t let my anger without thinking about.. Tom is a master for that. Make us change on a good way, but it sometimes very hard for us and for him... <br/>

Anger can be controlled.<br/>
If you examine your own childhood and then resolve to make Tom&#39;s the way <br/>
yours could have been and should have been, then when you do something sweet for <br/>
him you do it for him and for the baby-you, the memory of your childhood, too.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Honestly, if I want to take something he likes, I don&#39;t know what... He <br/>

<br/>
Is he healthy otherwise?  Some people are just thin.<br/>
Some people, though, do have a medical problem.  But those usually have other <br/>
symptoms.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe you DO need to pay attention to when and whether he needs to go to the <br/>
toilet for  a bit, if you&#39;re afraid he might be having a digestive problem or <br/>
some such.<br/>

For here, I would say milkshakes or smoothies with protein powder.  We have a <br/>

Is it only when he is engaged in watching television that he doesn&#39;t notice hunger?  We just eat in front of the TV frequently, but I don&#39;t know if that would be a faux pas in France.<br/>

(And I&#39;m probably not even using the phrase with the exact right meaning.  We do lose nuances in cross-cultural and cross-lingual expression.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-831386337">It can be difficult for parents when a child&#39;s body is not &quot;average&quot;.  There is a lot of pressure for all bodies to be &quot;just so&quot;, rather than accepting the natural variations.  Children often go through &quot;thin&quot; and &quot;fat&quot; stages as part of the natural growth process.  For some these stage are barely noticeable and for others there are extremes.<br/>
<br/>
My nephew, at about age 10, gained a lot of weight and had quite a large belly.  I remember thinking, this kid is getting fat!  Just a few years later he became very tall, lean, and broad shouldered.  He needed that body fat for the period of rapid growth that was to come.<br/>
<br/>
My two daughters have always been toward the thin side.  They eat noticeably less than many of their friends.  Which comes first?  Are there appetites smaller because they are genetically smaller people?  Or are they small because they don&#39;t eat as much food?  I&#39;ll never know that for sure, but I do know that *I* can&#39;t possibly know for them how much they should eat.  That is something they need to figure out.  My job is to make sure that food is in the house and prepared for eating.  Their job is to eat it, or not.<br/>

I have been told that I went through a period of saying &quot;indubitably&quot; instead of &quot;yes&quot; when I was five or so.  Must&#39;ve been obnoxious.  I remember Marty when he was three or so saying &quot;Maybe&quot; instead of yes or no for a while.  I think he was just trying it out.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; is a place saver like &quot;ummmm.....&quot; so that he can think.  He&#39;s responded, but he&#39;s still waiting to decide what his final, definite answer is, maybe.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-937949089">but I do know that *I* can&#39;t possibly know for them how much they should eat.  That is something they need to figure out.  My job is to make sure that food is in the house and prepared for eating.  Their job is to eat it, or not.<br/>

************************* Yes, I think the same. That&#39;s my ideal. And all is happen at home at the moment learned me that I&#39;m really new with unschooling, that even if I feel it very deeply, it&#39;s not so easy for us to live it... And I react exactly the same than Tom, I can see it... I can&#39;t stand any pressure, and if there is pressure, I stop. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1064673318">Maybe &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; is a place saver like &quot;ummmm.....&quot; so that he can think.  He&#39;s responded, but he&#39;s still waiting to decide what his final, definite answer is, maybe.<br/>
****************************** Yes... I start to see better what&#39;s going on.. He&#39;s so intuitive ! Like I said on the other mail, he doesn&#39;t stand any pressure, for anything. And even if we try to &quot;unschool&quot;, we are waiting. We are waiting for him react simply. But it&#39;s not simple. It&#39;s difficult, because we are waiting, even if we don&#39;t want. <br/>
I can see it so clearly today that I&#39;m exactly the same. How can I be so blind ! <br/>
Even if we don&#39;t ask him, we are waiting inside... And since he was born, he react to our &quot;inside&quot;, and never to what we can say. Only what we have inside. He can read in our minds as if it was a book... <br/>
I&#39;m sure now he&#39;s telling us &quot;leave me alone!!!&quot;...<br/>
And how he react is showing us how much we don&#39;t let him being free...<br/>
Some of your answers were difficult for me to hear, but I want to thank everyone here. Speaking about this helped me a lot to see more clearly what&#39;s going on. <br/>
Thanks <br/>

My oldest dd is very sensitive to even the slightest amount of pressure from<br/>
me or anyone else.  She totally shuts down.  Simple things like Grammy<br/>
asking her to read a book to her when she was 5.  (Of course, she wanted to<br/>
hear her granddaughter read and I had told her how well she could read.) And<br/>
then, when she wouldn&#39;t Grammy responded with, &quot;fine, I didn&#39;t want to hear<br/>
you read anyway.&quot;  Her feelings were hurt and she wanted her to feel guilty<br/>
on some level, even if she didn&#39;t know it.   I don&#39;t think she&#39;s ever read<br/>
in front of my mother still and she&#39;s now 10.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When we were first legally home schooling is our state, I kept a few things<br/>
aside to put in a memory box to create a portfolio out of.  It was just<br/>
things she had written on her own, some artwork, and some ticket stubs and<br/>
photos.  When she realized that I was planning to show them to someone else,<br/>
she didn&#39;t write another word for a WHOLE year!  It was a very long year<br/>
with me sweating what I would show in a portfolio.  I found another route to<br/>
go and still be within the law.  She is very private and really needs to<br/>
know someone before she shares her thoughts with them.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
She is also like a barometer for respectfulness.  If anyone does anything<br/>
that even remotely crosses the line, all her alarms go off.  She has made me<br/>
a much better parent than I ever would have been if she hadn&#39;t been so<br/>
sensitive.  I am thankful to her for opening my eyes.  It has been hard<br/>
sometimes.  I&#39;ve even lost a couple friends because I put her feelings<br/>
first, but that&#39;s what happens when you grow sometimes and other people<br/>
can&#39;t see it or respect it.  I don&#39;t have a problem with it anymore.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Keep listening to him and just lay off on any expectations.  Play with him<br/>
like you would if you were his friend and not his mother.  Keep at it and it<br/>
will get easier.<br/>

****************** Yes, it&#39;s what I try to do now. And since those few days, I think it&#39;s going to be easier. And I&#39;am reading &quot;Playful parenting&quot;, it helps me, because I have difficulties for playing...<br/>
