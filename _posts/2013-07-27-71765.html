<div id="ygrps-yiv-802579884">My 11 year old has recently become interested in animation and has been making these little YouTube videos (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://m.youtube.com/channel/UC_cXF4sNbNi4jIFquc8wyvA)">http://m.youtube.com/channel/UC_cXF4sNbNi4jIFquc8wyvA)</a>. He comments that he doesn&#39;t know how to make the characters walk etc... Does anyone have kids interested in this and have any book recommendations or other resources?  I&#39;m kind of at a loss.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-167489777">A good starting point for animation is Scratch - it&#39;s a free platform for creating animation and games. It has good interactive tutorials and it&#39;s easy to use, although it does require some reading - it&#39;s real world, drag and drop programming, so someone will need to read the labels on the tags. <br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t go to books as a starting point for learning about programming and animation, I&#39;d go right to a platform - or at the very least a game with a &quot;sandbox&quot; feature. If not actually using the platform, watching online tutorials - there are a million tutorials on youtube.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1500865336">I don&#39;t have a book or a background in animation, but doing a quick search<br/>
on YouTube for [how to animate walking] comes up with a lot of great<br/>
tutorials right off the bat. From there some video creators reference books<br/>
with more information (if you really want books) or other websites with<br/>
more information. You will also start to see the preferred tools used by<br/>
these animators.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.<br/>

Scratch, as Meredith suggests, is wonderful as well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1749366158">Yes, the Klutz book company do a couple of excellent books on this. Visit their website or amazon. They are called &#39;animation&#39; or something similar! My son has had hours of fun. They include a downloadable program which my son has used to great effect.  There are also some great animation apps available for the iPad if you have one. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-889914249">My son has really enjoyed using a free program called Minemator to make minecraft animations. He&#39;s also used scratch. Both programs are really different from each other, so it&#39;s probably worth having a look at a few different ones. There are also some good stop motion animation apps for the iPad/iPod. We used Stop Motion Studio Pro, which was quite affordable.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-589357816">Check out ToonBoom and their different programs. The least expensive one is about $30-$40 and would be a good starting place. If you sign up on their website, you&#39;ll get discount offers. There is a 30-day free trial that&#39;s basically the full program. There&#39;s an iPad app too, which is fun. <br/>
<br/>
My daughter received the more expensive program as a gift, but prefers Flash. I don&#39;t think she would have been able to navigate it alone, though, and she has a few years of experience with drawing software under her belt already. <br/>
<br/>
Does she use a mouse or a stylus? While getting used to using a stylus is challenging, that might be something to look into as well. Once she gets used to it, she&#39;ll probably find it indispensable. My daughter actually games with hers too <br/>
<br/>
Have her check out MAPs and MEPs on YouTube. They&#39;re Multi Animator or Editor Projects where a group of artists get together and each person animates a few seconds of a clip, kind of like an animated music video . It&#39;s a great way to work without getting burned out. If she likes Warrior Cats, there are a ton of Warrior MAP videos and people are always posting openings for new ones. <br/>
