<div id="ygrps-yiv-412682901">We went to a library science talk for children.  The topic was forensic <br/>
archaeology and was geared for elementary aged children. The speaker was <br/>
very good and began to talk about how they would make guesses about what <br/>
happened to the person who died.  My daughter piped up with how Buddy on <br/>
Dinosaur Train called a guess a hypothesis.  A little boy who was about <br/>
a year younger (who we didn&#39;t know) piped up and said that he saw that <br/>
show too and that after the hypothesis they would try to prove it.  The <br/>
speaker was just thrilled that they understood what she was talking <br/>
about and could make the connection.  The two childern were pleased to <br/>
add something to the conversation.  All because of a common TV show <br/>
experience.<br/>
<br/>
I enjoyed watching it unfold.  Thanks for letting me share.<br/>
