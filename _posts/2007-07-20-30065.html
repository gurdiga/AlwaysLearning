<div id="ygrps-yiv-1900046908">I&#39;m going to be occupied this afternoon and evening, out of the  <br/>
house, and am going to Denver for something Saturday night (which  <br/>
involves many hours of driving).<br/>
<br/>
Although I can check e-mail each late evening, there will undoubtedly  <br/>
be messages that sit in the queue waiting for a moderator to say &quot;okay.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I usually do that.  There are another couple of moderators, but  <br/>
here&#39;s the situation:  The new Harry Potter book comes out this  <br/>
weekend.  I forgot that when I agreed to do this discussion in  <br/>
Denver.  My book will sit for at least 24 hours before I start to  <br/>
read it.  (Horrors... I&#39;ll be distracted.)<br/>
<br/>
None of this lends itself to smooth and busy list activity.  So  <br/>
please be patient, if you send a post and it doesn&#39;t come to the list  <br/>
right away.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Well if so, you&#39;re an international criminal, and I don&#39;t know  <br/>
whether I should have criminals minding the store here.<br/>
Don&#39;t tell how or if you finished that book.  There&#39;s no statute of  <br/>
limitations on murder, nor, I think, on letting HP books out early,  <br/>
so you&#39;d better just never mention it again.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll write on the side about whether you really want to moderate  <br/>
Happy Land here...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-77118089">Not a criminal, just super blessed :) No ordinary muggles &#39;round here! Some<br/>
kind of enchantment charm I&#39;ve got ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1146727534">I was serious about not discussing an advance copy of Harry Potter.<br/>
<br/>
Do not discuss it.  Someone violated a written contract and could  <br/>
lose a job, and it&#39;s just not right, so no more discussion.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, rarely so serious</div>
