<div id="ygrps-yiv-543378849">I have been re-reading Sandra&#39;s book... but the new version. Sandra:  I<br/>
would love to hear your ballads.<br/>
Do you have any recordings to share?  Especially the ones you describe in<br/>
the book... used in your classroom.  I love learning from songs... and 3.5<br/>
year old dd, Zoya, loves things learnt thru songs.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to collect some of these ballads/songs that put everyday<br/>
information/history.math etc into song format.<br/>
Any sources or places online i can find/buy them?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you! Hema<br/>
<br/>

I did record some years back, but they&#39;re on cassette tape and I don&#39;t  <br/>
think there are extras.  Somewhere I have the master.<br/>
<br/>
I could sing some ballads at the monkey platter festival at some  <br/>
point, maybe.  Twice at conferences I&#39;ve done something with ballads.<br/>
<br/>
But those are good for history and geography and language and trivia  <br/>
of culture of some hundreds of years ago, or of shipwrecks or  <br/>
trainwrecks more recently.  I sang The Titanic, at the HENA conference  <br/>
in Arizona in March, and said there was still one survivor living.   <br/>
She&#39;s died since then.  She had been a baby, in the lifeboat.<br/>
<br/>
For learning more current little-kid things, the best we ever had was  <br/>
called Sounds Like Fun and came from Discovery Toys.  We used to play  <br/>
it in the car.  It had alphabet sounds and courtesy and counting by  <br/>
tens and the months of the year.  Not ballads (not story-songs), just  <br/>
little songs.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We can count by tens, up to one hundred, we can count by tens, ready here we go!  I love this CD, too.  One of my lullabys is the &quot;i love you so much&quot; song also from this CD.  Thanks for mentioning a good one!  :)  Jennie<br/>
