&gt; Do you believe that it is in the best interests of our children to ask<br/>
&gt; and or tell our children at times to do something or to stop doing something?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Even if you&#39;re trying not to, your question is phrased asking for a rule.<br/>
<br/>
The answer is, It depends. Why the child is doing something matters. Whether the child is harming himself, others, or property matters.<br/>
<br/>
Stop a child if he&#39;s hurting anything.<br/>
<br/>
But see protecting the world from your child as your job. It&#39;s your job until he shows he can do it himself by actually doing it. Your goal isn&#39;t to get him to obey or follow your directions. It&#39;s to help him and the world peacefully co-exist. If he shows he can&#39;t yet, then don&#39;t put him in situations where he will fail until he is mature enough to act appropriately.<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t punishment! It&#39;s being kind to him and the world. If there&#39;s some activity he loves but can&#39;t handle appropriately bring it here and maybe someone will have some ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Depending on the situation try to figure out what need he&#39;s trying to (inexpertly) meet. Then help him find a safer, more respectful of others, practical way to meet the need. It might mean leaving a situation.<br/>
<br/>
Or is he reacting to something internal like hunger, tiredness, boredom, overwhelm? If so, tend to that. But work at noticing before he reaches that point.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  if he does not stop, what response is in the best interests of the child?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If he doesn&#39;t stop, that&#39;s communication. He&#39;s saying that for whatever reason he can&#39;t stop. It might be tiredness or hunger. It might be he&#39;s reacting to past control by showing you that you don&#39;t control him any more. That&#39;s normal but don&#39;t put him in situations where he will act &quot;defiantly&quot; until he&#39;s recovered. Treat his recovery from control like recovery from a broken leg. For a while he&#39;s not going to be able to run let alone walk so don&#39;t ask him to.<br/>
<br/>
But if you give real examples it will be easier to explain. While explaining the theory is my favorite part, it&#39;s much easier to understand the idea when you can see what they looks like in a real context.<br/>

<br/>
Sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
-=-...and what is the best response for our child if they do not listen.?-=-<br/>
<br/>
It depends.<br/>
<br/>
-=-If you ask or tell your child to stop doing something [for example, to stop doing something because it could be endangering his safety] if he does not stop, what response is in the best interests of the child?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware that these questions are not good ones.  You&#39;re looking for rules, for an over-simplified map with only two stops on it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen that people are still taking time to respond to them, but it sounds to me like you want us to come up with a consensus (or for one of us to provide an answer) to settle a disagreement between parents, or between a parent and a grandparent.   <br/>
<br/>
So my response is going to be to start here, and stay there.<br/>

You must become an unschooling parent for ANY of this to work.  <br/>
