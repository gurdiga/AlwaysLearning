<div id="ygrps-yiv-2144818757">&lt;&lt;There was an original Twilight Zone show called &quot;Eye of the Beholder.&quot; <br/>

OHHHH, the pig one.  I remember seeing that when I was a kid and it freaked <br/>
me out.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As for the Dove ad ~  the first one came out when Sorscha was around age 7. <br/>
It said, &quot;Thin is OUT.  Healthy is in.&quot;  It totally teed me off because <br/>
there I had been the thin, bony girl (who didn&#39;t meet the happening 80&#39;s <br/>
school girl image) who turned into the thin, bony woman (who now somehow was <br/>
the early 90&#39;s image) who ate healthy and it STILL wasn&#39;t enough.   I&#39;d <br/>
finally gotten to the so called &#39;correct media body image&#39; (even though I <br/>
was just me and always had been) and they NOW wanted J-Lo booties.  I wrote <br/>
something to Dove like, &quot;Maybe you should just say &#39;healthy is in&#39; - we&#39;re <br/>
all different. Just because I&#39;m 5&#39;10&quot; and weigh 128 doesn&#39;t mean that I&#39;m <br/>
OUT. I&#39;m me, I&#39;m healthy for me.&quot;<br/>

*Who&#39;s not waiting for thin with a little belly to come back around in my <br/>
lifetime.  Hmmm, maybe in 60-years or so.  Wasn&#39;t it the Renaissance where <br/>
they like robust bellies and small boobies?</div>

 </span></blockquote>Good that you wrote to Dove about it. You took action. This got me <br/>
thinking about taking action instead of just complaining as so many <br/>
do, and that taking action doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be big like <br/>
starting a movement or becoming a lobbyist.  Being aware and <br/>
addressing things in the moment are some of the most impactful <br/>
actions we can take. Writing a letter, making a call, saying <br/>
something.<br/>
When the Little Mermaid came out my friend&#39;s 3 yo girl was watching <br/>
it for the 3rd time that day while my friend was scrubbing her <br/>
kitchen floor (she wasn&#39;t my friend yet..she was a college student <br/>
working at my dh&#39;s restaurant and he had suggested me to help her <br/>
with her math).  I came in and sat with the girl for a little bit and <br/>
then I said &quot;hey Cassie.  Do you think that&#39;s reasonable to leave <br/>
your Dad and your sisters and everything you&#39;ve ever known for a guy <br/>
you&#39;ve never even spoke to before?&quot;  The mom from her kitchen <br/>
says &quot;MARY!!&quot; and looked at me like I was crazy.  My response was &quot;if <br/>
she&#39;s gonna watch it this much you should think about these things.&quot;  <br/>
Our girls are 20 now and she mentioned that my saying that had stuck <br/>
with her and been a good thing. <br/>
