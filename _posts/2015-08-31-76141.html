It is not sparkly enough. &nbsp;I think it might even be a little depressing. &nbsp;I&#39;m so tired that I&#39;m not responding as actively as I normally would. &nbsp;I encourage more videos than I think they are actually interested in. &nbsp;I&#39;m overwhelmed by mess, and still having massive food aversions, so not fun to cook with, etc. &nbsp;<br><br>I should mention that we had some major money problems this year and are only just recovering, so we weren&#39;t able to buy as many things as I would like them to have. &nbsp;Normally we would go out frequently, there are very nice parks and woods within driving distance, but we lost our car in our financial difficulties, and this pregnancy has been difficult (walking and buses are a limited option), so we aren&#39;t getting out much. &nbsp;We have a very small house with a square cement back yard- although I think that is actually my complaint more than theirs. &nbsp;<br><br>They are actually very happy and seem like they are getting their needs met, but I just don&#39;t feel like it is good enough. &nbsp;I&#39;m noticing behavioral issues that make me think they aren&#39;t stimulated enough- a bit more fighting than usual, getting into things in a destructive way, for example, purposely dumping toys in order to see my reaction, or tearing up artwork angrily that they then deeply regret and are upset about. &nbsp; I have ordered some more craft supplies (they like painting and clay and stamps, etc, and I had run out completely) and have booked in my calendar some more homeschool meet ups, some manageable activities with considerate friends. &nbsp;I plan to continue with the babysitters a few afternoons a week. &nbsp;I think the children are short on toys, so trying to stock up a bit using re-selling websites. &nbsp;But does anybody remember being at this stage (or any stage where you are not at your physical/mental best)? &nbsp;Are there any tricks/perspective I&#39;m missing? &nbsp;Thanks so much.</p></div>

<br/>
Lots of times.  <br/>
Kirby was five when Holly was born.<br/>
I had three, bam. <br/>
<br/>
Four years after that, Keith accepted a six month contract to work in Minneapolis (very far from Albuquerque).  They extended it for six months.  And again.  And again.<br/>
When it had been four years, I asked him not to extend.  He came home for 8 days each month and we visited there a few times a year (part of the contract perqs) but still....  it was rough.  <br/>
<br/>

It sounds like you&#39;re doing pretty well.  There are ideas here that could help, I hope.<br/>

Most recently, my husband was in a head on collision with a drunk driver and off his feet an unable &nbsp;to work for eight months. Lots of financial uncertainty for all of us, lots my time dealing with the lawyer and doctor&#39;s offices and insurance companies and everything else. &nbsp;My kids are older than yours (18, 15, 10, and 9) so they&#39;ve got a better understanding that the rough patches are temporary, but it&#39;s still hard on all of us.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);"><br></span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);">I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve got help. That sounds like a GREAT idea. I&#39;m wondering if there are some little, sort-of-sparkly things that you can do with your kids in the &nbsp;between times. I made my younger two a playdough out of baby oil and flour recently (like this one&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.kidspot.com.au/kitchen/recipes/cloud-dough-2958">http://www.kidspot.com.au/kitchen/recipes/cloud-dough-2958</a>)&nbsp;<span style="word-spacing:normal;line-height:1.25;">&nbsp;</span><br>and it kept them busy for large chunks of the next two days. That was in the middle of our month with a dry well and it wasn&#39;t messy at all. &nbsp;What about mixing food coloring with some water and corn starch to make sidewalk paint to use in your concrete backyard? Mircowaving ivory soap? &lt;http://kidsactivitiesblog.com/8994/how-to-make-erupting-soap&gt; If you&#39;ve got a really good mixer make flour and water playdough and mix it until the gluten forms and you can stretch and spin it like pizza dough...maybe outside on the concrete. :-)&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);"><br></span></div><div><font color="#3f3f3f">My kids could spend a whole day having fun with projects like that. Pinterest is full of ideas, as long as you can hop on just long enough to grab a good idea or two and not get bogged down. &nbsp;</font></div><div><font color="#3f3f3f"><br></font></div><div><font color="#3f3f3f">Would audiobooks be &nbsp;something to try? I know my kids will listen for a lot longer than I can read, and if it&#39;s a good book it sparks lots of questions and discussions along the way.</font></div><div><font color="#3f3f3f"><br></font></div><div><font color="#3f3f3f">I don&#39;t know your kids or what they like.
