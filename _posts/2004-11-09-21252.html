<div id="ygrps-yiv-941635232">Thank you all, and you all spoke right to my heart and confirmed with me the lie will not go through my familiy&#39;s walls. <br/>
I am fine letting things be, letting my sis figure out her stuff, letting her kids come here for a vacation. I told her last night, though that I will not be able to lie if and when her hubby goes to jail. Right now he is working on getting bailed out. He has been charged with forcing a minor to give him a blow job. Some party a few years back is now haunting him. Alcohol, new years. <br/>
<br/>
My hubby has worked through lots of his feelings and is ok with the kids coming into our tiny home for a few days. My sis lives with my mom and because I spoke my truth about not lying and my hubby not thrilled to have to cramp his home, we are the bad unhelpful family who selfishly won&#39;t help. Everyone else is doing great things to help my mom said.<br/>
Thank you again for the support. I know in my heart big ugly lies make for big ugly lives and I won&#39;t compromise this. <br/>
<br/>
I thiunk I&#39;ll have the kids here for the next few days. I&#39;ll let you all know how things go.<br/>

<br/>
I would send her the bill thusly:<br/>
<br/>
I would say &quot;Don&#39;t you ever criticize my parenting or my family again.&quot;<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t say it nicely and I wouldn&#39;t say it sweetly.  I would say it <br/>
levelly but soberly and I would look at her eyes when I said it (if it were me, and <br/>
if it were my sister).  And if she said &quot;screw you&quot; or any variation thereon, <br/>
that would be the last time I did her a favor for a long long time.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; He has been charged with forcing a minor to give him a blow job.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s rape, isn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;My sis lives with my mom and because I spoke my truth about not lying and <br/>
my hubby not thrilled to have to cramp his home, we are the bad unhelpful <br/>
family who selfishly won&#39;t help.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
For the moment you are.   Truth looks different at a distance.<br/>
Lies are ugly from any angle.<br/>
<br/>
You are the at-peace, positive living family unwilling to sacrifice your <br/>
integrity and your children&#39;s peace to *slightly* soothe someone with BIG problems <br/>
he (allegedly) brought on himself.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;big ugly lies make for big ugly lives&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree with you hugely.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Everyone else is doing great things to help my mom said.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard drunks say that.  And if your brother in law is using alcohol to <br/>
justify what he allegedly did, perhaps that is a problem of his.  I&#39;ve heard <br/>
drunks insult their children or other relatives for not helping them more, and <br/>
I&#39;ve known (and been) a child who bailed a parent out of trouble, emergency <br/>
rooms, dangerous late-night situations, paid the gas bill, paid for the phone so <br/>
I could call and check on her, brought groceries and paid the rent.    That is <br/>
not &quot;help.&quot;  That is enabling.  That was pouring my OWN good, healthy life&#39;s <br/>
energy and on the scrap pile of her life.<br/>
<br/>
People make choices.  Their choices affect other people.  If a choice is to <br/>
create a disaster, pulling down the immediate family, then the extended family, <br/>
then the in-laws and the neighbors is NOT okay, and you don&#39;t have to be <br/>
shamed into slipping into someone else&#39;s pit.<br/>
