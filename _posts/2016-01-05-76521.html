<div id="ygrps-yiv-1887210596"><div><div><div>Hello all, <br><br>We&#39;ve been unschooling for just over a year now. My son 
is 7 and went to school for 3/4 of the year before deciding to stay 
home. Although my son is happier at home I feel like we are not fully 
tapping into the joyful side of unschooling. <br><br>He is heavily into 
gaming and we&#39;re supporting that interest - we bought a new gaming 
laptop a few months ago and heaps of new games in the last Steam sale. 
We&#39;ve also progressed onto more mature games including finally allowing 
him to play GTA 5. My son really enjoys playing and watching gamers on 
YouTube. We&#39;ve also connected with a few other unschoolers online. I 
watch and play with him as much as possible although it&#39;s hard to find 
the time because my 14 month old is very active and if we&#39;re sitting in 
front of the laptop he wants to touch everything in range. If I&#39;m not 
with him I&#39;m usually close by. <br><br></div>Although it&#39;s not always easy to see what he is learning I&#39;m confident that he is learning. <br><br></div>The
 issue we have is that he is not very physically active and apart from 
visiting his friends he rarely wants to go out and do anything. He never
 has been a very active child to be fair but it really worries my DH who
 thinks it&#39;s unhealthy for him to be in front of the computer all day. <br><br></div>So
 I try to introduce other things but generally it&#39;s not met with much 
enthusiasm. A trip out of the house can be spoiled by moaning and 
continuously asking to go home even with incentives like ice cream and 
burgers. I invite him to do activities in the backyard and he&#39;s not 
interested. He has few interests outside of gaming. He doesn&#39;t want to 
use our pool, he doesn&#39;t like sports, doesn&#39;t want to go the beach, 
doesn&#39;t want to read stories. Says he likes drawing but never uses the 
materials I leave out for him. <br><div><br>My DH has not read much 
about unschooling so it&#39;s hard for him to fully accept the amount of 
gaming. So he criticises and then my son - who has quite a prickly 
character anyway - responds badly. He also thinks that DS should be 
spending more time with kids his age at school. I think this is partly 
some resentment that he has to go to work everyday while DS gets to do 
whatever he likes at home. <br><br></div><div>I really want to respect 
his right to choose what he does without it creating disharmony in our 
family as opposed to the peaceful joy I read about here. I wish he was a
 bit more rounded in his choice of activities. It&#39;s hard to reassure his
 dad that he is learning when I&#39;m still in leap of faith mode. I set up a
 private FB page for his dad so I could post pics of things we are up to
 every day but I&#39;m kind of scrapping for moments when he&#39;s not gaming or
 watching YouTube so I can present something different. <br><br>I also 
sometimes feel like I don&#39;t have the energy to offer more and be a 
really good unschooling mum to him because the baby takes so much of it.
 So I worry that he&#39;s not doing much because I&#39;m not offering enough. 
That said, a day when we stay home all day and he gets to do whatever he
 wants on the laptop is what he describes as a perfect day at the 
moment. <br><br></div><div>I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;m asking for really. Some
 reassurance that gaming all day is okay. Some ideas of how to create 
more peace in our house and assurance for my DH that what we&#39;re doing is
 okay. <br><br></div><div>Thanks, <br></div><div>Keelie<br></div>DS 7, DS 1<p><span><br class="ygrps-yiv-1887210596yui-cursor"></span></p></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1175643591"><p dir="ltr">Don&#39;t look for balance. Look for fun ways to get some physical activity while gaming. XBox Kinect, WiiU, and maybe PS4 (I&#39;m not sure) all have features that allow you to play physical games. Trampolines or jumping on the bed are great while watching youtubes. </p>
<p dir="ltr">My son was very much like this at 7. He got into karate at 9 1/2 and now he divides his time between the two. Efforts to get him to be physical just for the sake of it were met with the response you would expect from someone being told &quot;your choice of activity is inferior,&quot; if even for a moment. Work on trust, and play.</p>
<p dir="ltr">My dh felt the same way as yours, I think. He tried all sorts of things to get Wallace off the computer. It was mostly a disaster. I mediated it as best I could, and pointed out all the good as often as I could, and was respectful and honest with my husband about his concerns and his right to an opinion on the matter, and he eventually relaxed. We bought some games that he enjoyed, thay they could play together, as a way to connect. The more my son saw his dad taking an interest in his choices, the more respected he felt. Then, when dh asked him if they could do something together that *wasn&#39;t* on the computer, Wallace knew it wasn&#39;t just to get him to stop with the computer, and he was more interested.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It was all about relationships and respect, in my home, not ideas about what &quot;should&quot; be happening. When we embraced the former, worries about the latter fell away.</p>

Was he part of the decision for DS to leave school? If he feels a bit out of the loop, he might feel he has valid concerns that aren&#39;t being heard or addressed. If he&#39;s open to reading about unschooling, there&#39;s lots of great information. If he isn&#39;t, though, maybe there are some compromises you can make that could make life more joyful and peaceful for everyone.&nbsp; <br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1080137524yui_3_16_0_1_1452030572120_10137" dir="ltr"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1080137524yui_3_16_0_1_1452030572120_10136" dir="ltr">If DH has concerns about his lack of interaction with other kids, would his concerns be eased by knowing about the online friends? If not, is there a local homeschool group or unschool group you could meet with? If a couple of hours once a week would set your husband&#39;s mind at ease it might make home more peaceful the rest of the time. If your son isn&#39;t interested in it, perhaps you could entice him (maybe money for Steam or pizza or something). If there isn&#39;t a homeschool group of interest, perhaps there is a 4H club (my sons did a robotics themed 4H club for a while).<br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1080137524yui_3_16_0_1_1452030572120_10533" dir="ltr"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1080137524yui_3_16_0_1_1452030572120_10462" dir="ltr">Other things we&#39;ve done to include Dad: making and launching model rockets, family movie night, evening read alouds (including audio books), nature documentaries, and making Christmas gifts for extended family.</div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1080137524yui_3_16_0_1_1452030572120_10679" dir="ltr"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1080137524yui_3_16_0_1_1452030572120_10680" dir="ltr"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1080137524yui_3_16_0_1_1452030572120_10381" dir="ltr">&nbsp;<br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1080137524yui_3_16_0_1_1452030572120_9920"><span></span></div><br> <div id="ygrps-yiv-1080137524yui_3_16_0_1_1452030572120_9921" class="ygrps-yiv-1080137524qtdSeparateBR"><br><br></div><div style="display:block;" id="ygrps-yiv-1080137524yui_3_16_0_1_1452030572120_9928" class="ygrps-yiv-1080137524yahoo_quoted">  <div id="ygrps-yiv-1080137524yui_3_16_0_1_1452030572120_9927" style="font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;font-size:16px;"> <div id="ygrps-yiv-1080137524yui_3_16_0_1_1452030572120_9926" style="font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;font-size:16px;"> <div id="ygrps-yiv-1080137524yui_3_16_0_1_1452030572120_9925" dir="ltr"> <font id="ygrps-yiv-1080137524yui_3_16_0_1_1452030572120_9924" size="2" face="Arial"> <hr id="ygrps-yiv-1080137524yui_3_16_0_1_1452030572120_10705" size="1"> <b><span style="font-weight:bold;">From:</span></b> &quot;keeliebean@...

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1589711179">Hey Keelie [&#X1f60a]<br/>
<br/>
Firstly, over the past 9 month since we&#39;ve lived here I&#39;ve seen your DS at various things - parties, trampolining, swimming - both being active and being with friends...he always seems like a happy, friendly kid.<br/>
<br/>
Second - it&#39;s only been a year since you started unschooling/properly deschooling. And he&#39;s at the age when kids start to get *really* into gaming...I&#39;d think both those things combined make it likely that yes - gaming is going to be his preferred activity. Also, you said he&#39;s never been all that active anyway -  but after a good long while of deschooling, and being able to play his games unhindered by school or whatever, you might find he&#39;ll want to do more things out of the house eventually.<br/>
<br/>
We did get Kai a mini-tramp, but to be honest he doesn&#39;t use it much anymore - he did in the start, but not now the novelty has worn off.  There are less options to be active when kids mostly play on laptops - like your DS and Kai do. But I don&#39;t worry anymore - Kai&#39;s been predominantly gaming on his laptop most days for at least 2 years - he&#39;s still healthy, happy, and more and more keen to do other things outside the house now - like swimming, walking and karate. But it&#39;s not &#39;balanced&#39; - or not how an outsider would see &#39;balanced&#39; - he still games for the better part of most days.<br/>
<br/>
It might help to ask your husband if he thinks that DS would be anymore active if he were at school, sat at a desk all day long? He&#39;d likely be just as stationary. Is it mostly the lack of activity that is worrying your DS? I know your DS has friends, both online and IRL. For many introverted kids, having friends online is so much easier for them anyway - how fantastic they get that opportunity, and aren&#39;t forced to &#39;socialize&#39; with big overwhelming groups of kids everyday! [&#X1f60a]<br/>
<br/>
Really, it&#39;s still early days for you all. If you want to post things on the Facebook page for your husband, what about screenshots of things DS is making/doing in his games with exciting captions of what is going on? Is DS interested in going to Eltham H/S park day at all?<br/>

Subject: [AlwaysLearning] Finding balance between gaming and other activities<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been unschooling for just over a year now. My son is 7 and went to school for 3/4 of the year before deciding to stay home. Although my son is happier at home I feel like we are not fully tapping into the joyful side of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
He is heavily into gaming and we&#39;re supporting that interest - we bought a new gaming laptop a few months ago and heaps of new games in the last Steam sale. We&#39;ve also progressed onto more mature games including finally allowing him to play GTA 5. My son really enjoys playing and watching gamers on YouTube. We&#39;ve also connected with a few other unschoolers online. I watch and play with him as much as possible although it&#39;s hard to find the time because my 14 month old is very active and if we&#39;re sitting in front of the laptop he wants to touch everything in range. If I&#39;m not with him I&#39;m usually close by.<br/>
<br/>
Although it&#39;s not always easy to see what he is learning I&#39;m confident that he is learning.<br/>
<br/>
The issue we have is that he is not very physically active and apart from visiting his friends he rarely wants to go out and do anything. He never has been a very active child to be fair but it really worries my DH who thinks it&#39;s unhealthy for him to be in front of the computer all day.<br/>
<br/>
So I try to introduce other things but generally it&#39;s not met with much enthusiasm. A trip out of the house can be spoiled by moaning and continuously asking to go home even with incentives like ice cream and burgers. I invite him to do activities in the backyard and he&#39;s not interested. He has few interests outside of gaming. He doesn&#39;t want to use our pool, he doesn&#39;t like sports, doesn&#39;t want to go the beach, doesn&#39;t want to read stories. Says he likes drawing but never uses the materials I leave out for him.<br/>
<br/>
My DH has not read much about unschooling so it&#39;s hard for him to fully accept the amount of gaming. So he criticises and then my son - who has quite a prickly character anyway - responds badly. He also thinks that DS should be spending more time with kids his age at school. I think this is partly some resentment that he has to go to work everyday while DS gets to do whatever he likes at home.<br/>
<br/>
I really want to respect his right to choose what he does without it creating disharmony in our family as opposed to the peaceful joy I read about here. I wish he was a bit more rounded in his choice of activities. It&#39;s hard to reassure his dad that he is learning when I&#39;m still in leap of faith mode. I set up a private FB page for his dad so I could post pics of things we are up to every day but I&#39;m kind of scrapping for moments when he&#39;s not gaming or watching YouTube so I can present something different.<br/>
<br/>
I also sometimes feel like I don&#39;t have the energy to offer more and be a really good unschooling mum to him because the baby takes so much of it. So I worry that he&#39;s not doing much because I&#39;m not offering enough. That said, a day when we stay home all day and he gets to do whatever he wants on the laptop is what he describes as a perfect day at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;m asking for really. Some reassurance that gaming all day is okay. Some ideas of how to create more peace in our house and assurance for my DH that what we&#39;re doing is okay.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Keelie<br/>

She has learnt to type and learnt about servers and mods and computer stuff. She watches her favourite Youtubers and is learning heaps from them. We have created her own YouTube channel and we record videos together. She has made friends on the homeschooling server and interacts with them and others on the gaming servers. She plays minecraft story mode which is different still! We have minecraft Lego we play. I find other kids who like minecraft and tee them up for minecraft play dates. I buy her minecraft books that she can&#39;t put down!

Sarah&#39;s message almost mirrors where we are at right now, which is also reassuring. I&#39;m relieved I&#39;m not the only one who likes to take the opportunity to make our home cosy and welcoming, organised and inspiring.</p><p dir="ltr"><br></p>
<p dir="ltr">We have recently (this week) adopted a young dog who has been kennelled all of his two years so we have a lot of work to do with and for him. This is enriching for our girlies too (9 and 12). We&#39;re all learning so much. So here we are at home, a lot, for his sake. I feel confident that both our daughters are making good use of this semi-confinement and they are sourcing all their own entertainment. Finding their own balance I think. Well, they keep finding me to tell and show me everything they&#39;ve done or have found out and its always with huge smiles. I do sit with them occasionally, when they want me to.</p><p dir="ltr"><br></p>
<p dir="ltr">My 9 year old has made her bedroom in to her office, with a desk and &#39;proper&#39; chair and for the past two days she&#39;s squirreled herself away occasionally coming down to tell us something &quot;AMAZING&quot; she&#39;s learnt or made on the servers. And how funny her favorite you tubers are. I like them too. I take her up nibbles and drinks and she shows me all that she&#39;s done. I&#39;m super impressed by it all anyway. There&#39;s so much joy on her face when she gets to tell us all about it. And as my oldest tells me &quot;honestly Mum, it&#39;s true; when we&#39;re laughing, we&#39;re learning&quot;. Can you tell I have Joyce Fetteroll&#39;s tea tin on quotes. Grin.</p><p dir="ltr"><br></p>
<p dir="ltr">My youngest is DESPERATE to have her own you tube channel. I have tried and failed to get one for her (I am not good at that though I have tried hard). Would anyone please offer a link to advise how to?</p><p dir="ltr"><br></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1112286391"><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tr><td valign="top"><div>Hi Keelie 😄<br /><br />I&#39;m going to echo what Jo said - I&#39;ve seen your son at various events and he seems like a happy, friendly kid with a great sense of humour.  I still remember that birthday card he made and the way he described it.  <br /><br />I don&#39;t have much extra to offer in the way of suggestions, except maybe he&#39;d enjoy starting to make his own YouTube videos?  Even just for fun without uploading them, Abby went through a big stage of doing that for a while.  <br /><br />If he&#39;s as happy as he seems staying home and exploring all his games and YouTube, I think he&#39;s doing wonderfully.  Abby sometimes has days where she mostly watches YouTube and plays Minecraft, but she tends to be miserable and cranky by the end of the day and really perks up with social interaction and doing something physical with me.  She&#39;s a big extrovert though, so quite different. <br /><br
 />As he gets older, maybe your son will enjoy getting together with other kids to game, or move further into gaming with others online.  Does his dad play his favourite games with him?  That might be a good way for them to connect.  As for not wanting to go out, can he bring his games with him?  Then he could come and go a bit more.  </div></td></tr></table></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1753805424">Since we&#39;re discussing gaming and balance, I wonder if anyone has had a teen like my son. He&#39;s 15 and says that he hopes to become a planetary scientist, so he aspires to go to college. At this point, however, he has been completely involved in gaming (actually, this has been his main activity for about 4 years now). I&#39;ve discussed with him that he&#39;s going to need certain skills for college, but he hasn&#39;t shown much motivation for &nbsp;preparing himself in this way. Another issue we have is eating. He eats very little because he won&#39;t stop his games long enough to eat a decent meal. I&#39;ve tried keeping the house stocked with his favorite foods, and I will take the food to him while he&#39;s playing, but more often than not I end up throwing it away uneaten. Last year he was diagnosed with constitutional delay- at 15, he is 4&#39;8 and 65 lbs. He has never been a big eater, and I fear his preoccupation with gaming is making it worse. I am desperate for advice- especially on the eating issue! Thanks so much!<div><br></div><div>Shelly</div></div>

<br/>
Alex’s response was great.  Please re-read it.<br/>
<br/>
Eating doesn’t make people tall.<br/>
Affection, love, physical touch—if you wanted proof that the lack of something can cause stunted growth, children in orphanages, untouched, didn’t develop as well.<br/>
<br/>
I’m NOT suggesting you causes anything, and I’m NOT suggesting that you could ‘touch’ him to being bigger.  <br/>
I’m trying to say that blaming video games is unreasonable.<br/>
<br/>
“Preoccupation” is NEVER kindly said or kindly thought.  It’s critical and dismissive every time it’s spoken.  Preoccupation is a bad thing.  <br/>
<br/>
If you change your words, you will change your thoughts.  If you change your thoughts, you will change your actions.<br/>

<br/>
And read as much as you can about video games.  Size doesn’t matter, with video games.  Perhaps the best thing you could do is encourage and enable and provide in that direction.  It not only leads to a world of learning, it can (easily, and increasingly) lead to jobs.<br/>

It was so different to attachment parent and unschool one person for 5 years: I was so available to dive in whatever project with him at any given time and focus 100%. With a similar situation to yours ages-wise (a 7 1/2 year old and a 2 1/2 year old), I’m realizing its a whole other reality. It can be frustrating at times for my son for us to constantly be interrupted by his sister (who’ve very active and talks a lot) when he wants to do something with me. Often when we read a book she talks non-stop, describing what she sees on the images - which he finds awfully sweet most of the time, but sometimes it does really prevent him from hearing the story, so we try to ask her to listen with us or we try to find something else for her to do, but 3 minutes later she comes back and interrupts again. Earlier he wanted to play cop and robber with me in the street, but we ended up not really doing it b/c she doesn’t run fast enough to be either cop or robber and she would step down the sidewalk with cars coming - he was very different at her age and never stepped down a sidewalk but with her we need to keep our eyes on her as she just runs anywhere. I tried to run with her in a carrier but she is really really heavy now and I couldn’t really run. I tried the stroller but she didn’t want to sit in it :) I ended up running at the same rhythm as her which he didn’t enjoy b/c of course he could catch us right away when we were robbers and we never caught him when we were cops. :) So we decided to wait for daddy to be done with work by which time it was raining :)</span><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:'Myriad Pro';font-size:14px;">I told him we can look at Sandra’s page with suggestions for little ones, and choose some things to keep her really busy when we start a game or a project - though I realize that with her personality most things she’ll enjoy doing WITH US and not on her own for more than a few minutes.</div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:'Myriad Pro';font-size:14px;">Clara</div></div><div><br></div></font><div><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);word-spacing:normal;"><br></span></div></div><div><font color="#3f3f3f"><br></font><div><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);word-spacing:normal;"><br></span></div></div></div></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1671329920">--- I have a question though - I sometimes find maintaining a good<br/>
connection (with both kids - 7 and 1) quite exhausting. I&#39;ll have a<br/>
really good day then I find myself wanting to zone out and play on my<br/>
phone the next day. Does it get easier or do people find ways to manage<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
You could also think about whether you can build more recharge time into<br/>
those &#39;really good days&#39;. Being with small children really is tiring,<br/>
and it being rewarding and enjoyable doesn&#39;t stop it from being tiring<br/>
too. What recharges you may not be what recharges me, but you can build<br/>
it into small moments if that&#39;s what you have right now. Just stepping<br/>
into the garden for a few moments (possibly with the 1 yr old in arms),<br/>
or micro-meditation (watching your breathing for just a few breaths), or<br/>
talking to another available adult (partner or friends or family) about<br/>
getting a little bit of regular downtime. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I sometimes suggest &quot;snuggle up with iPads&quot; time to my 3 yr old -- I&#39;m<br/>
right there with him, and I&#39;ll glance at what he&#39;s doing/watching and<br/>
I&#39;m there if he needs me, but I can read something or have a quick chat<br/>
on Facebook for a few minutes. Bonus points if I&#39;ve managed to get a mug<br/>
of tea brewed at the same time ;) I find that can work well for both of<br/>
us and recharge us for the next round of running around / imaginative<br/>
games / etc.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-296891699">Today a new group member was unhappy that I returned a post recommending that the child should be limited to two hours of game play.   I wrote to her and sent links to good and happy information for becoming more familiar with unschooling, because she had said in the post I intercepted that she was new to unschooling.   <br/>
<br/>
She responded:  &quot;My suggestions were to do with all day screen time and not to do with unschooling.”<br/>
<br/>
As those who have successfully moved into unschooling discover, it is only when there is no separation between life and learning that unschooling is working well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1870352432">Years ago, every response in a discussion was new, when we didn’t have a good way to link to older discussions in message boards, or when our platforms disappeared more quickly.  Now, with Joyce’s site and mine being collections of some of the good parts of many past discussions, it’s a bit like a dispensary / pharmacy / apothecary, where people describe a problem and we prescribe links for them to read.  So I DO hope that people ARE going to the links. <br/>
<br/>
In side discussions (which I don’t like—I’m not inviting more side discussions), there were some posts not allowed through.  The mom will stay in the discussion, and I think things will become more fluid and peaceful for her.  So I don’t want anyone to claim these quotes, ever.  Let them be “once upon a time there was a family…” examples and let them slide into history.<br/>
<br/>
But first, a look and some prescriptions.<br/>
<br/>
-=-has been similar with games for many years and has been banned more than once for months.  He also has been very defiant in doing as I ask and from a young age would rather stay home even when fun places are suggested.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Wanting to stay home shouldn’t be seen as defiance.  <br/>
If home is the best place to be, be glad to have a home!<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/being/home.html">http://sandradodd.com/being/home.html</a><br/>
<br/>
With a reminder that the stories are about before the family heard of unschooling, and this was not done by an unschooler…<br/>
<br/>
-=-has been similar with games for many years and has been banned more than once for months.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If someone toook my computer away from me, I would rather stay home than go out with her, I bet.<br/>
If someone took anything from me for months, I would probably become defiant.  <br/>
<br/>
Being adversarial creates losers.  When a parent loses to a child, or a child loses to a parent, I’m going to count that as three losses—each person loses, and their chance of being partners takes another hit.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-872697167">I posted this in the discussion:<br/>
__________<br/>
Tonight, working on something unrelated, I found this:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/limits/listening">http://sandradodd.com/limits/listening</a><br/>
<br/>
It’s from a discussion in which a mom wanted to keep a child from listening to audiobooks so much.  <br/>
It’s not so much about what a child would be doing, but why a parent would want to stop him.  Learning doesn’t always show.<br/>
___________<br/>
<br/>
On the side, the mom who had recommneded limiting video games to two hours a day, the same mom who had removed access to games for months (more than once, perhaps) wrote this:<br/>
<br/>
-=-My son listens to audiobooks ALL the time...do you think it&#39;s ok for children to barely go out and spend each day on computer games then?-=-<br/>
<br/>
The elipsis was in the original.  I didn’t leave anything out.<br/>
And, a reminder that this is prior to any understanding of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
When a question is asked in so defensive a way, in such a leading way, the mom should first relax.  <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/breathing">http://sandradodd.com/breathing</a><br/>
The ideas there will do anyone good.  Me, twice yesterday—once when I was seeing that my projects were piling up faster than I could complete them even if I stopped eating and sleeping, and once when I DID try to sleep and was having a hard time.<br/>
<br/>
What I think, of the question above, is that video games are more stimulating and are likely to produce more learning and joy than the best of audiobooks.   If it’s okay to listen to audiobooks all the time, but NOT okay to play video games for more than two hours, this shows fear and prejudice (and lack of knowledge) on the part of the mom.  Deschooling could change everything for her (and I’ve already sent links to some good information on the side, for deschooling and moving into unschooling).<br/>
<br/>
If audiobooks are being listened to outside, then maybe this mom’s insistence that every person must be outside every day or health is lost could be achieved in a two-for-one way.  But some people live where it’s way too hot to be outside much every day.  Some are in winter where it’s too cold.  Some are in a dangerous urban area, and outside isn’t a daily thing.  Some have houses with big sunny windows, screened porches, patios.   <br/>
<br/>
Principles are better than rules.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/rules">http://sandradodd.com/rules</a><br/>
<br/>
Learning is better than control.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/control">http://sandradodd.com/control</a><br/>
<br/>
One person cannot “balance” another person’s life.  Control works against relationships, against peace, and against learning.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/balance">http://sandradodd.com/balance</a><br/>
<br/>
Worshipping books as a form, and a source, will work against unschooling.  It will work against a person’s learning about learning.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/bookworship">http://sandradodd.com/bookworship</a><br/>
<br/>
Some of those pages aren’t good on a phone.  Readers view will give you 150 words or so, but there’s much more there.  People who want to use this group as a resource for REALLY learning lots more about unschooling will probably do best to use a computer, rather than trying to rely on a hand-held quick-reference version.<br/>
