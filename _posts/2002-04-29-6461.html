&lt;&lt;  I know there has<br/>
to be some process for getting over long held ideas about parenting but<br/>
when the &quot;they need structure, they have disorders, they&#39;ll only ever eat<br/>
paper clips&quot; thing starts, my head wants to explode.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My first experience with this was years back.  Someone (who still corresponds <br/>
with me all these years later) had come to AOL in early days (or Prodigy, <br/>
even, maybe) to say that her very serious problem was that her two children <br/>
were working at the same level, and her daughter (nine or so?) would like to <br/>
do three or four pages of her language arts book, but her son didn&#39;t even <br/>
really want to do one, and how could she make them both do the same amount <br/>
happily?   <br/>
<br/>
I sent what I thought was a really obvious and simple answer, even if she had <br/>
been a schoolteacher with other people&#39;s kids, and said &quot;Let he do as many <br/>
pages as she wants to.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I got back the &quot;Well YOU couldn&#39;t possibly understand, since YOU are not the <br/>
mother of TWINS.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So... these two kids come out the same hole on the same day and so the boy is <br/>
expected to keep up with his sister for life OR slow her down to his speed, <br/>
so that &quot;the twins&quot; can be (literally) on the same page??<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Why?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Nobody had ever asked her &quot;why&quot; before.<br/>
<br/>
She let them split out and never regretted it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I guess everyone has to start somewhere.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
True.  I wish some of them didn&#39;t have to stay at that starting point for the <br/>
rest of their lives.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Are you really thinking of changing the intro to the list.  My<br/>
suggestion... &quot; If you say something unbelievably stupid we WILL attack<br/>
you and if you whine about it we will send someone to your house to beat<br/>
you up.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well I wasn&#39;t thi...)<br/>
