<div id="ygrps-yiv-358819588">*how to make unschooling work*<br/>
<br/>
Joyce, I loved your post... and that phrase at the end stuck out to me.  How<br/>
did I make unschooling work in my family?  I let go!  I let go of all of the<br/>
old tapes running through my head of how things are *supposed* to be and<br/>
just let them be what they are.  I started to change in myself what could be<br/>
changed... what I felt I should change... what needed to grow.  I stopped<br/>
trying to micro-manage my family.  I stopped trying to change them.<br/>
<br/>
I looked at the beauty in the world around me... knowing that there are<br/>
still some thorns and to watch where I step.  I choose everyday to look at<br/>
the world through different lenses... different lenses than most people wear<br/>
  I choose to trust... my DD, my DH, myself... I choose to trust the process<br/>
that learning is organic and that we will get what we need when we need it. <br/>
I choose to trust my creator and live to bring peace, love, and joy to the<br/>
world around me.  I choose to be proactive not reactive to my world.  I<br/>
choose to reply to people with love and not anger.<br/>
<br/>
DH still struggles a bit with letting go of the control... so I gently<br/>
remind him to trust our DD and to be there for her and talk to her about her<br/>
world.  Not to control her world for her.<br/>
<br/>
I look to other unschoolers who have *been-there-done-that* and take their<br/>
example and apply it to my life... knowing that they are off the beaten path<br/>
but they are way more grounded and living a much more beautiful and full<br/>
life than the rest of the world that I see.  I take their opinions about my<br/>
hang-ups and really try to see their POV... if I took it personally (like I<br/>
ve seen too many people do), I wouldn&#39;t be able to *get it* and apply it to<br/>
my life.  <br/>
<br/>
