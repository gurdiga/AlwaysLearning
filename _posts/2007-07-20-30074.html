<div id="ygrps-yiv-1219848386">Hi all--<br/>
<br/>
My 12 yo son wants to take a computer programming course at the JC.  To begin meeting the <br/>
prereqs. he would like to take an online math course--probably beginning with K-12.  Before <br/>
getting too deep with any program, I wanted to find out if anyone has had success and a <br/>
positive experience, and with which ones.  Any recommendations?  Thanks, Joanna</div>

  This is Judi Lawson and probably have an answer for your question. I am in India these days on my vacation and have found a company which provides Online math class( It has already been doing it from past many years and have contracts with many state governments in US). My own chlid is planning to join it. I made my child to go for a free demo with them and he is really very impressed, me too. I heard that Indians are great at math and yes, now i am assured and the best part is, that you can get the session scheduled according to your comfort timings. If you feel interested to go for a free demo or want to explore more about them, i am giving you an id for that...Please contact them according to your convenience and yes they offer you a plan via which you can recover your cost as well as can get a few extra dollars every month( do ask them about it!!!).<br/>
  here the id: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:maths_help@...">maths_help@...</a><br/>
   <br/>
  Hope your son would love it!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1888298631">So because I allowed the question, I allowed the answer, but how and  <br/>
where to pay for formal education isn&#39;t a good use of this group.   <br/>
There are maybe a badillion other lists where people can better  <br/>
review formal learning.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that formal learning&#39;s a taboo, but too much discussion of  <br/>
formal learning and recommendations of saving money by selling formal  <br/>
learning are just not going to lead us to more and better discussion  <br/>
of natural learning.  I&#39;m not saying people shouldn&#39;t discuss that  <br/>
anywhere, just that it&#39;s not the purpose of this list.<br/>

would be a better time<br/>
<br/>
(but in those two days of waiting, people could find countless lists  <br/>
where the discussion of online math programs would be more welcome)</div>

Theoretically, I suppose.<br/>
<br/>
But she explained in the first post why.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind her getting answers to her questions, but I&#39;m less happy  <br/>
with answers that turn into sales pitches.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Assuming the &quot;requirements&quot; are &quot;high school math&quot; you might look <br/>
into getting copies of the math sections of the common standarized <br/>
tests - the GED, SAT and/or ACT. Any big-chain bookstore should have <br/>
them. There are lots of &quot;ifs&quot; but it may be that all he needs is a <br/>
quick tutorial as to how various problems are presented and what the <br/>
symbols mean, or that he just needs to work in one area. Going <br/>
through the test with him would give you both and idea of that. <br/>
<br/>
I used to tutor math in a GED program and most people only needed <br/>
help in one or two areas. Taking a K-12 math course on line seems <br/>
like overkill, unless it was the sort of thing where he could glance <br/>
at a section and say &quot;okay, I know that&quot; and move on or skip around <br/>
if he wants. Its a total waste of his time (imnsho) to take courses <br/>
in basic skills that he can do on a calculator, as long as he <br/>
understands the concepts.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-285898637">hi friends<br/>
  Yes i really agree with Meredith and Joanna. I too felt the need to ask these questions as Rolly( my daughter ) is not that bad in the subject and knows a good chunk of her grade&#39;s math. It will take me sometime to clearify my doubts also and probably Meredith is right as she has an experience in the field. Lets see. I will mail to the id again and find out or ask my brother to find out more about their service as he lives in the same province, but that can take some time.If you want, mail your doubts yourself and find it out.<br/>
   <br/>
  Take care<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-988036865">Sorry Sandra--<br/>
<br/>
I wish I had asked for responses offline--I didn&#39;t really want to discuss--and I didn&#39;t post <br/>
on another list because this is the only list I&#39;m on right now.  I was hoping to hear from an <br/>
unschooling parent whether they had success with anything that had worked for their kids <br/>
in a flexible sort of &quot;unschooly&quot; way, but I&#39;m realizing I didn&#39;t actually say that.  I have <br/>
great respect for the acummulated wisdom of those on this list and thought that there <br/>
may have been those who had been down this road.<br/>
<br/>
I apologize for beginning a discussion--that was not my intention--but of course I should <br/>
have known that&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen on a discussion list! :-)  Joanna<br/>
