<div id="ygrps-yiv-1895561321">I know there was someone on here with lots of theater experience/knowhow -  <br/>
maybe Pam Sorooshian? I&#39;m trying to put together a homeschooler theater &quot;class&quot; <br/>
 and would like someone to bounce a couple ideas off of. Would you mind <br/>
e-mailing  me offlist, please? Sanguinegirl83 @ aol.com<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks!<br/>
