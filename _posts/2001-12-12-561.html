<div id="ygrps-yiv-1579478441">Our daughter was due Christmas day but came 3 weeks early on <br/>
December 5th.  The first year we did the &quot;actualy birthday day <br/>
thing&quot;, the second we did the same.  When her two cousins were born <br/>
the 3rd and 4th we gave up and just moved her birthday to the first <br/>
weekend in November.  The weathers great and we never have to <br/>
negotiate for birthday rights that other weekend.  <br/>
