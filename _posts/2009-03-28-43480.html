Or maybe a clipped word, a colloquial alternative to &quot;raising&quot;  <br/>
cookies. Maybe it&#39;s a judgement on how the parent reared their  <br/>
children, &quot;cookie&quot; being a derogetory term? -=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that&#39;s right.<br/>
<br/>
Just because a 13 year old posted it, it doesn&#39;t mean it was written  <br/>
by that same 13 year old.  I doubt anyone is really using raisin  <br/>
cookies to lure kids to spell well.  Maybe. &lt;g&gt;  I was thinking  <br/>
possibly part of the &quot;joke&quot; (though it wasn&#39;t a great one in any case)  <br/>
was that &quot;raisin&quot; was misspelled &quot;raisen&quot; in the original statement.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But looking at the statement, if it meant a kid won&#39;t spell for raisin  <br/>
cookies but might have spelled for chocolate cookies or for money,  <br/>
that doesn&#39;t make sense either.  Would a kid learn to spell for an  <br/>
XBox?  For drugs?<br/>
<br/>
Either kids can spell or not.  Same with adults.  Even with a desire  <br/>
and practice, people don&#39;t all have the same capacity.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2064142239">well that was exactly my point, but also that the *kid*  - if she wrote it  - thinks the right incentives would have helped. <br/>
