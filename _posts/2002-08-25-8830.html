<div id="ygrps-yiv-2011574128">*** I do think it is fair for a kid to ask her mom to push <br/>
her a little. I sometimes want my husband or my friends to push me a bit,<br/>
<br/>
too.   Heck, I wouldn&#39;t like an aerobics instructor who stood up at the<br/>
front <br/>
and said, &quot;Don&#39;t expect me to try to talk you into hard physical<br/>
exercise, <br/>
you just do what you feel like doing right now.&quot; There is a place in our <br/>
lives for other people who give us a little shove here and there.***<br/>
<br/>
I suppose I was responding to the words &quot;make her&quot; which sounded to me<br/>
like &quot;you get up and do it missy!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I would help anyone who asked for a reminder, sure.   I ask for those<br/>
too.  But the words that were used... &quot;make her&quot;... didn&#39;t sound like the<br/>
nice reminders we all give each other, it sounded like something else.  <br/>
I don&#39;t make anyone do anything around here, except maybe myself.&lt;g&gt;   I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t make my husband take out the trash and I wouldn&#39;t make my son<br/>
practice piano.    <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I read the word differently.   Maybe I&#39;m having a flash back to my<br/>
childhood, after all these years of successfully blocking it out. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

to it for me than &quot;make me&quot;. &quot;Remind me&quot; can&#39;t become a power struggle,<br/>
you remind and that&#39;s it. &quot;Make me&quot; easily can...<br/>
