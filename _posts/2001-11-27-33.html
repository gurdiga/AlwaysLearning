<div id="ygrps-yiv-1845123407">Hi!<br/>
  I have a question about my 4yo (in September) son who is beginning to sound <br/>
out words, telling me what letters words start with, and what sounds letters <br/>
make. I got him an easy reader, level one and he can read it with very little <br/>
help. (Gets stuck on the word &quot;everyone&quot; every time!) I know that he has a <br/>
great memory and and is getting some clues from the pictures in the book so <br/>
I&#39;m not sure how much he&#39;s actually reading. He loves to ask me how to spell <br/>
different words and then he types them on the computer. I would sound the <br/>
word out slowly and he was correctly guessing the letters that made up the <br/>
word. He adores books and is constantly wanting to be read to...possibly he&#39;s <br/>
trying to learn so he doesn&#39;t have to rely on someone to read to him.  I <br/>
guess I&#39;m looking for any ideas to help him along or any feedback on his <br/>
progress.<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
Amy<br/>

<br>and a few other books by her.... these are little books that have repeated words, but they aren&#39;t &quot;phonics&quot; readers. They are funny, they read in a sort of rhythm (but not in rhyme), and they have great pictures and are perfect for a 4 yo who wants to read on his own.

<br>
<br>The cool thing is that you don&#39;t NEED to know. &nbsp;You don&#39;t have to grade him compared to another 25 kids, and you don&#39;t even have to report to his parents every six or nine weeks! &nbsp;
<br>
<br>There might be lulls in his progress instead of a sharp, steady curve.
<br>
<br>It sounds like he&#39;s having fun with it, and as long as he sees it as something desireable and joyful, however it comes will be good.
