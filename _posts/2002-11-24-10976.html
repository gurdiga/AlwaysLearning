&lt;&lt; After all, what&#39;s it matter if a complete <br/>
stranger knows or doesn&#39;t know your kids gender... or even your own <br/>
gender!?!  Think of it as social camouflage or perceptually helping the <br/>
transgendered and intersex (hermaphrodite) community.) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In the early 1970&#39;s, my dad complained to me while driving about some <br/>
long-haired person wearing jeans, walking the same direction we were driving, <br/>
 &quot;I can&#39;t even tell if it&#39;s a boy or a girl.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I said &quot;What does it matter?  Will you drive any different if it&#39;s a girl?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It was also women&#39;s movement days and it was nice to point out to my dad that <br/>
it was possible to just treat each person as a person.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby had waist-length hair most of his childhood, and when he was nine or so <br/>
had me cut it off, because he was tired of people telling him he was in the <br/>
wrong bathroom.  (I didn&#39;t note the haircut in his diary, but I do have the <br/>
hair, and a date on it.)  He said when he had facial hair he would grow it <br/>
long again.<br/>
<br/>
Well it was long again before facial hair, but he didn&#39;t look like a girl <br/>
anymore.  <br/>
<br/>
Just this September he came back from Nan Desu Kan (an anime convention in <br/>
Denver) and said he wanted his hair cut off.  I wouldn&#39;t have agreed, but it <br/>
was the third time he had mentioned it, over the course of a few months.  I <br/>
asked him several questions, including whether he was doing it to spite some <br/>
friends he was grumpy with.  He gave the right answers, I cut it off (one <br/>
rough cut, to be touched up after a shower) and he said wait a day or two to <br/>
mess with it more, because he might want to just let it grow back out.<br/>
<br/>
Every friend he saw seemed dismayed.  Some got used to it and said it looked <br/>
nice.  It&#39;s too long in the front, but because he&#39;s planning to let it grow, <br/>
he just wants it left.  I assured him it wouldn&#39;t hurt for him to just cut <br/>
off himself anything that seems to sproing out too far.  He only wants me to <br/>
cut it.  <br/>
<br/>
It looks nice on him.  I miss the long hair too, but I&#39;m aware that I miss it <br/>
as a kind of hippie status symbol for me, so I call it what it really is and <br/>
breathe that out.<br/>
<br/>
One little homeschooled kid we know named Pete Martinez had GORGEOUS long <br/>
curly baby hair until he was four or so, and when he got a haircut I was sad <br/>
just because I liked looking at him.  But I was never the one who had to wash <br/>
or brush it, so I didn&#39;t say a word.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was kind of sad when Lars started wanting shorter hair.  I&#39;ve always<br/>
preferred long hair on both sexes.  But I never said anything to him about<br/>
it.  He kept wanting to go shorter and shorter, and I still never said<br/>
anything.  (I was just hoping he wouldn&#39;t go as short as a brush cut.  He<br/>
never did.)  When he stopped asking for haircuts and started growing it a<br/>
year or so ago, I was very happy.  But I still didn&#39;t say anything about it<br/>
to him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1465333373">A little neighbor girl used to call Dylan a girl all the time and one day<br/>
after telling her he was a boy she said, <br/>
&quot;Why is she a boy?&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
At Karate class one girl, who had been insisting he was a girl finally<br/>
came to me to get the strait poop.  She asked &quot;Is your daughter a girl or<br/>
a boy?&quot;   = )<br/>
<br/>
Some folks have a hard time with long haired boys.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The rudest comment came from a stranger in the grocery store who told my<br/>
son he needed to get his hair cut and start looking like a &quot;real&quot; boy.  <br/>
I think he was eight or nine at the time.   <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Bwah! Rain looked like a boy for a while about 9 months ago - she had a<br/>
&quot;mushroom&quot; style haircut and was in a chunky stage, and wore loose<br/>
t-shirts and ragged, too-big jeans. I think it was partly intentional for<br/>
her - she really wanted to know what it would be like for people to think<br/>
she was a boy. And yeah, there were some people who didn&#39;t believe she<br/>
was a girl until I backed her up...<br/>
<br/>
As soon as she got bangs cut, though, everyone knew she was a girl again.<br/>
