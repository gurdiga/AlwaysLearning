<div id="ygrps-yiv-702862811"><html><div style="color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">I have an 11 year old that has never gone to school and right now does not like to go anywhere either.<br>New games are great, watching TV together is great. Talking about his games is great. He loves it.<br>I play a little bit with him , I read about his game a little so I know what he is talking about, I watch him play a little.<br>I just got some Magic The Gathering cards so we can learn to play and see if he will like it.<br>I am planning on finding some other board games to play with him.<br>A few months ago we built a gaming computer together after months of saving and researching and selling some old toys to make enough.<br>He helps me a little to take care of kittens and he helps his dad a little when he needs in the farm but he rather be doing his things.<br>I get him books from the library and leave in his room so he can take it
 or not. He likes Manga/Comic books/Pop Tokio<br>The only place he went this year was to a Anime Convention and we had fun that day but neither him nor his sister wanted to go a second day.<br><br>But really his favorite things is talking to me about things he finds out, video games he is playing.<br>I share funny video game memes with him, I share funny stuff with him because he loves anything that is funny or a joke.<br>I have offered fun stuff but right now he wants to stay home.&nbsp; I make him foods that he likes, homemade milkshakes and yummy stuff.<br>Today I realized he just passed me in height!]<br>I guess he may be needing this time to grow! Saving all his energy . SO he plays games, explores Youtube, Netflix and books. <br>He talks to me, plays a little with his sister and is happy.&nbsp; Maybe do more of the things he likes to do now. <br>Play some games with him, talk about it. watch some good movies together or
 shows!<br><div><span><br></span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><font face="courier">Alex Polikowsky</font></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div class="ygrps-yiv-702862811y_msg_container">&nbsp;<br></div><div style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt;"><div style="font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:12pt;"> </div> </div>  </div></html></div>

he has enjoyed in the past, some new, both alone or with me, but they are often
rejected.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In these
situations, when nothing else entices, he usually goes back to his
computer.<span>&nbsp; </span>He has said that
sometimes he uses the computer for lack of anything better to do.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-370202909MsoNormal"> &nbsp;</p> 

<p class="ygrps-yiv-370202909MsoNormal">I was just reading today on Sandra’s site about how
unschoolers watch tv.<span>&nbsp; </span>Especially
Pam’s quote hit home. <span style="font-size:14.0pt;">“In a way, how much tv they watch is an indicator
for unschooling parents as to how well we&#39;re doing in creating a rich and
stimulating environment.”<span>&nbsp; </span></span><span>There is more to
the quote about not taking it too far, but </span>I still think it is
relevant.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-370202909MsoNormal"> &nbsp;</p> 

<p class="ygrps-yiv-370202909MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span>I know
that I need to do more for him so that he has options.<span>&nbsp; </span>But my problem is that I’m not sure
what else to suggest or offer him.<span>&nbsp;
</span>He does not like to go out except for the usual things that are very
familiar like the trip to the grocery and to visit grandparents, or for things
that are special and not too often, aircraft carrier museum, train ride,
Disneyland. He doesn’t like to see other people, especially kids.<span>&nbsp; </span>I keep trying to think of things to do
like: <span>&nbsp;</span>build models, build lego,
make a movie, design or work on a costume, cook, or work on a train layout
(examples of stuff he has liked in the past or thought he might like).<span>&nbsp; </span>When I am bored I usually want to work
on a hobby : paint, knit, garden, do push ups or what ever.<span>&nbsp; </span>But he doesn’t have go to projects that
he likes to continue.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is a
recurring pattern that he expresses interest in an area and we try to get more
of that to help him pursue it, but he doesn’t really want to “do” very many
things.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I put the word “do”
in quotes because there seems to be a difference between taking in info like he
usually does,<span>&nbsp; </span>or playing games,
and what he is seeking (something more active).<span>&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-370202909MsoNormal">I’m feel like I’m wasting his time because I can’t
see what I should be doing.</p><p class="ygrps-yiv-370202909MsoNormal">Thanks, Melissa</p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1754578944"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;He has often said that he wants to do something  &quot;off the couch&quot; (his words).&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I guess I&#39;m getting stuck on how to plan a richer life mostly at home.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My son is going to be 11 in a couple weeks, so our boys are similar in age.  He is also a lover of home and an avid gamer, so they may have some similar interests.  I will share some ideas that have worked well for us, but I think it&#39;s most important that you observe what he does like currently (in the games he plays, or in the ideas he expresses), so that you can help him build on his existing interests as well as introduce new activities and ideas that might spark something unexpected.<br/>
<br/>
We have a pull up bar from our kitchen to our living room.  Ethan likes to swing on it.  He has also tied rope to it and used it with the rope in a number of interesting ways.  Some examples included making it into a swing, experimenting with it to see how waves travel along it, making it into a type of pulley.<br/>
<br/>
We have a small trampoline in the house that has been in both the living room and Ethan&#39;s bedroom.  When in the living room, he would often jump on it while watching tv.  In his bedroom he uses it to bounce out ideas he has when he is playing games on his computer, or when he&#39;s excited about an accomplishment he&#39;s achieved in a game.<br/>
<br/>
Outside, pogo sticks have been a big hit with my son and our friends.  We also have a slack line and an outdoor trampoline.  I use the slack line and the trampoline with Ethan.  He loves that.  I try the pogo stick, but I&#39;m not great at it.  We also go bike riding from time to time.  A couple of times we planned a bike trip around our neighbourhood in search of a geocache.  That was fun.<br/>
<br/>
We have nerf guns that we have played with together in the front and back yards.  I&#39;ve set up obstacle courses and hidden targets for something different and challenging.  We throw frisbees and play tag around the yard too.  Recently we played a fun game where one of us took a close up photo of something in the yard, and the other one had to find it.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve made a variety of different paper airplane designs and thrown them off our back porch.  We&#39;ve dropped eggs off the porch in a variety of protected housings.  Did you know that you can actually walk on a carton of eggs?!  (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiRw-PzLiXQ)">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiRw-PzLiXQ)</a>  I haven&#39;t tried that yet, but I think Ethan would love that one.  I&#39;m looking forward to surprising him with a few cartons of eggs on the driveway and seeing what the results are!  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve made soda geysers and pop rockets outdoors.  Usually, I set it up and invite him out to watch me.  Most often he wants to give it a go after he sees me.  Sometimes even before I get a chance to try it.  :-)   Giant bubbles have been a big hit as well.<br/>
<br/>
I like to find things that have some unexpected reaction, because that delights Ethan.  One of Ethan&#39;s favourite video games a few years ago was called Crazy Machines.  It was then I discovered that he loved cause and effect type relationships, so I always keep an eye out for anything like that.  Recently, I found this popsicle stick chain reaction (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.stevespanglerscience.com/lab/experiments/popsicle-stick-chain-reaction)">http://www.stevespanglerscience.com/lab/experiments/popsicle-stick-chain-reaction)</a>, and went ahead and made one of my own to show Ethan.  He loved it!  Dominoes are fun too.  Rube Goldberg type set-ups have been a hit here over the years as well.  Here&#39;s a fun one from Honda to inspire you:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWk9N92-wvg.">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWk9N92-wvg.</a>  You can make these from almost anything you find in the house.  <br/>
<br/>
For most of these activities, it works best with Ethan if I get involved first.  I have a lot of fun with the kinds of activities I&#39;ve listed.  I think that in itself is contagious enough to encourage Ethan to join me.  From there, he either pursues it further himself, or it becomes something fun that we shared and then cached as a happy memory, maybe to resurrect another day in some unexpected way.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Deb Lewis wrote a nice list of things to do, and Sandra saved it here:<br/>

<br/>
While your thinking of some ideas to spruce up your days, take some extra time to play his games with him.  Even if he&#39;s using games as a default for the time being, your playing with him will provide him with some variety and company, and will allow you to better understand where his interests lie.  Playing games with Ethan has been the greatest way for me and my husband to really connect with and better understand our son.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1003737042">My son also resists going out, and the very fact the suggestion comes from me seems to put him off! But I have kept one day a week free from other comittments and we jokingly call it our school trip day. Because it happens every week there is less resistance and when we are out he shifts into a different mindset and is often really engaged and engaging, it&#39;s the best time for real conversations between all of us. <br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s not fun or not working we just come back home. These trips are rarely things he would choose or things he is excited about beforehand, because we always draw a blank there, he has no suggestions. We have discussed and laughed about the fact that our interests are different but I have noticed by observation that he is more interested in the world out side the house than he perceives himself to be, so I persist in dipping him in it!<br/>
<br/>
 We have included things as small as a trip to local library, and as big as a science fair in London. We have a pin board where we cut out snippets from magazines and local newspapers as trip wish lists. These are mostly suggested by his sister and I but it means we discuss, plan and dream in advance which helps him to accept and process the ideas. And reject some of them out of hand! I write as much of these as poss in our calendar so he can see them coming as he has requested/needs advanced warning of events in his life. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I do think everything seems to go better with a bit of planning, once he is feeling &#39;stuck&#39;, he is resistant to all suggestions, I find it better to anticipate and pre-empt that state.</div>

You may end up going places alone, but he might come along. If it&#39;s interesting enough for you to make plans and leave the house, it might interest him enough to come along. Does he have friends he can invite?&nbsp; Portable gaming devices?&nbsp; &quot;Hey, I&#39;m going out to lunch, want to bring your (game/laptop) and come too?&quot; (This is suggested with the assumption that him staying home while you go out is an option).<br><br>I find in my family, I tend to be the one who wants to be out in the
 world, and my husband likes to be home.&nbsp; On my husband&#39;s days off, I used to spend the day suggesting ideas for fun things to do, places to go, etc, and waiting for someone to show some kind of interest.&nbsp; By the end of the day, we&#39;d often never left the house.&nbsp; Now I just plan fun things when I want to do them, and find fun things that I think everyone will enjoy.&nbsp; I plan, I go, I bring the kids.&nbsp; My husband sometimes wants to come, mostly wants to stay home.&nbsp; He&#39;s usually a lot more interested in going if everything is already planned out and all he has to do is get dressed and walk out the door with us.&nbsp; He also doesn&#39;t enjoy going out for the sake of the journey, so finds the concept of making a &#39;journey&#39; or making decisions about a journey stressful or off-putting.&nbsp; So I streamline it as much as I can by planning in advance.&nbsp; <br><br>Also if you live near enough to a theme park, and that is a special
 thing he loves and is willing to leave the house for, get season tickets if you can!&nbsp; Season tickets are often not much more (and sometimes less) than the price of going twice, and then you could plan to go once a month or once a week or as often as you can.&nbsp; Getting out more often to do something totally special and fun might make getting out in general easier.&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp; <br></div></html></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1291219114"><p>&nbsp; Caitlyn (almost 7), also prefers to stay home a lot, as does her dad, while I like to be out and about a lot more. She enjoys spending her days gaming and Skyping, watching her favorite Minecraft You Tubers, creating stories with her Pokemon and assorted other toys, and watching Digimon (recently several weeks almost nonstop), and Pokemon and a few other things. She finds something she likes and pretty that is the focus for weeks or months. I have gotten a Minecraft and Animal Jam account and we play together or watch Youtube videos together. I know who all her favorite people are and often send her Facebook links when I think there&#39;s something/someone she&#39;ll like. I&#39;m not as good at sitting down and doing the creative play since I need to constantly be moving, so I&#39;ve had to find other ways to stay engaged and share her joy. &nbsp;<br><br>Her interest in staying home vs going out seems to be cyclical and it&#39;s helped me to realize that and be ready for when she&#39;s ready to do a lot of time away from home. We do normally try to get out a couple of times a week, usually for ice cream or some other treats, or the zoo or something else I think falls in line with her interests. Recently, we moved to a much larger house that offers her a lot more space to spread out all her toys, and lots more fun stuff outside and in the neighborhood. New insects and other wildlife have has caught her attention (we even found a walking stick) and she&#39;s become interested in finding out more about local wildlife. I&#39;ve made sure to make those new things exciting for her. She saw snow for the first time last year, and this year it&#39;s the changing of the leaves. I guess my excitement has rubbed off because she&#39;s been pointing out particularly colorful trees or ones that she&#39;s noticing change, and she&#39;s begun to collect leaves which we bring home to look them up together, and then become beds for her favorite toys.<br><br><br>Last week I stopped by the library and picked up two books which I plan to poke through with Caitlyn for some ideas. You might leave something like them around for your son to pick up or for you to look through together. The first is called &quot;Unbored, The Essential Field Guide of Serious Fun&quot; and the other is &quot;This Book Made Me Do It&quot;. <br><br>Laura Zurro &amp; Caitlyn&nbsp; <br></p> <div class="ygrps-yiv-1291219114ygroups-quoted"><br><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> ---In alwayslearning@yahoogroups.com, &lt;boisei@...&gt; wrote:<br><br><div id="ygrps-yiv-1291219114ygrps-yiv-464411877"><p class="ygrps-yiv-1291219114ygrps-yiv-464411877MsoNormal">I’m getting stuck with my 11 yo son.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We’ve been unschooling for about 2 ½

</span>He does not like to go out except for the usual things that are very
familiar like the trip to the grocery and to visit grandparents, or for things
that are special and not too often, aircraft carrier museum, train ride,
Disneyland. He doesn’t like to see other people, especially kids.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I keep trying to think of things to do
like: <span style="">&nbsp;</span>build models, build lego,
make a movie, design or work on a costume, cook, or work on a train layout
(examples of stuff he has liked in the past or thought he might like).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I am bored I usually want to work
on a hobby : paint, knit, garden, do push ups or what ever.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But he doesn’t have go to projects that
he likes to continue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a
recurring pattern that he expresses interest in an area and we try to get more
of that to help him pursue it, but he doesn’t really want to “do” very many
things.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I put the word “do”
in quotes because there seems to be a difference between taking in info like he
usually does,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>or playing games,

<div id="ygrps-yiv-179933387"><html><head></head><div>Hi,&nbsp;</div><div>My name is Adrienn and although my children are still small (4,1.5) I joined this list to help me understand Unschooling better. I am having difficulties with the unlimited screen time and after reading the discussion on the bored 11 year old boy I would like to ask something?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Isn&#39;t it strange that so many 10-11 year olds are interested in the SAME thing (computer games)? Unschooling is an autonomous exploration of life that follows the person&#39;s &nbsp;interest so it is a very individually tailored journey for every child, and yet when they discover video games it seem to become the main interest for so many of them.&nbsp;</div><div>Why is that?&nbsp;</div><div>And it also seems that these children whose curiosity was nurtured from babyhood focus their interests on computer games and the rest of the world with its &quot;off the couch&quot; activities don&#39;t seem very exciting after that.?&nbsp;</div><div>I wonder, could it be that computers and tv are PHYSICALLY addictive for the human brain? Its colours, moving images and sounds are PHYSICALLY hooking the brain making it difficult for children to just treat it like any other activity.?</div><div><br></div><div>It seems that parents are developing special strategies to get the children out of the house, to get them interested in other activities. Where is the curiosity gone?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This worries me because I thought that if I let my children follow their interest and not enforce any control over their activities they will stay curious and driven to find out more and more about the world.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I look at my children when they watch tv or muck around on the computer and they don&#39;t hear or see anything outside the screen!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Maybe I&#39;m getting it all wrong and it is not like this at all. After all I don&#39;t live with any of these children and don&#39;t see their intense interest in many other things other then compute games. It just seems that parents often single out playing computer games in their discriptions more than any other activity.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Do you think screens may have a physically addictive affect on the brain which would make it unfair to leave the children decide for themselves when to stop?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I&#39;m asking this because I would like to let go of the anxiety I have with tv and computer time and your personal insights may help.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks</div><div><br></div><div>Adrienn</div><div><br></div><div><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> On 5 Nov 2013, at 04:15, Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Sandra@...">Sandra@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br><br></span></blockquote></div><blockquote type="cite"><div>

We visited many places and had fun but there were times that I needed him to be entertained so I bought him a handheld console called a Nintendo DS and a little Scooby Doo Game.&nbsp; For the most part I played the game and he watched. <br></span></div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span>I have never been a video game player so it was new to me too. With time he played more and I would do hard parts. <br></span></div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br><span></span></div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span>A couple months later we went to buy a
 new game and this young kid at the store told us the Super Mario 64 for DS was a great game. OH MY GOSH!

No. I did not become a gamer and I played a little with him, mostly watched him and helped and supported&nbsp; and fed
 hid passion.<br>&nbsp;But I GOT IT! I was seeing not only the joy but all the learning he was doing. Soon after when he was I found a game called Roblox online that was pretty new and we made an account for him. That game was an amazing opportunity for me to see him learn and for my son. It is now 6 years later and his character is still known by veterans. People did not believe him when he said he was 5 in the game. Yes he learned to read and write playing Roblox!</span></div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br><span></span></div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span>Because I joined myhim and learned about video games because of my son and his passion for it and I saw the values of video games all doubts&nbsp; never really

 gaming I have been reading everything about it that I can because that is the kind of person I am. I do the same for My Little Pony that my daughter loves or her Monster High dolls. I read about the games, the story behind them and much much more. I can say for someone that plays very little, as I still play with my son when he asks, I am pretty knowledgeable of gaming. Now I do the same with things my husband loves like cows and genetics, basketball, baseball and running and biking. <br><br>5 weeks ago I came across a Coursera course ( if you do not know what Cousera this is the web definitions:<span>&quot;Coursera is an educational technology company offering massive

    My 15 year old son is a huge gamer and in the last few years has
    discovered the world of podcasts. He is more up to date on the news
    and current events worldwise than I ever would be.<br>
    He has expanded his world incredibly without leaving the house.&nbsp;
    It&#39;s really fun to watch his explorations.&nbsp; And he and I have
    fascinating conversations on the drive to karate practice.&nbsp; And he
    has no restrictions on his computer time and access so he&#39;s free to
    explore any podcast he likes.&nbsp; Same with games.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    For my 13 year old daughter, I have found to helpful to
    differentiate between being bored as being part of a desire to
    expand and grow or being bored as a name for being tired, out of
    sorts, and restless.&nbsp; For the first situation, I have found it
    helpful to realize that developmentally there are shifts around 8,
    12, 14 and 17 and 21 (I really like Natural Learning Relationships
    model by the Luvmours).&nbsp; What my child used to like might no longer
    be enough.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I need to look with a fresh set of eyes what is she
    asking for and how do we meet those needs? And if she doesn&#39;t know
    yet, that&#39;s okay.&nbsp; So if I don&#39;t get stuck in &quot;something is wrong,
    she&#39;s bored&quot; and see it as an expansion, that lets me get more
    creative in helping her.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    And if she&#39;s bored because she feels tired/out of sorts/restless,
    then that&#39;s an invitation for lots of connecting time.&nbsp; <br>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1302290445">I (a 32 yr old mother of 2) LOVE video games.  LOVE them.  I also LOVE books. I LOVE movies and sci FI tv shows. I can get totally absorbed in a game or a book or a show for hours or days or weeks.  I do that less now because I find being my kids mom so fascinating and fun-- it&#39;s easier to put a book or game down or save it for when they&#39;re asleep.  <br/>
I also really LOVE nature and animals and camping and food and astronomy, physics and languages and going to coffee shops and the grocery store and taking walks along the creek.  I love trains and cars. I love spending time with my friends and my family.<br/>

We focus intensely on what interests us.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-481091524"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Isn&#39;t it strange that so many 10-11 year olds are interested in the SAME thing (computer games)? Unschooling is an autonomous exploration of life that follows the person&#39;s  interest so it is a very individually tailored journey for every child, and yet when they discover video games it seem to become the main interest for so many of them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why is that?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I would encourage you to spend some time learning what people, young and old, learn from playing video games.     <br/>
<br/>
Have a look at one game called Minecraft has to offer it&#39;s players:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI0BN5AWOe8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI0BN5AWOe8</a><br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s only *one* game.  In our home playing a variety of video games has inspired so many activities both on and off the computer.  Here&#39;s a incomplete list of some of those activities: <br/>
<br/>
watching informational videos and custom animations, <br/>
<br/>
reading wikipedias,<br/>
 <br/>
designing and writing our own programs using mods or visual programming languages like Scratch, <br/>
<br/>
employing drawing tools to make our own characters or copy those we are inspired by,<br/>
<br/>
using a digital keyboard and sound recording tools for music and video,<br/>
<br/>
learning to play some of our favourite video game music on the piano,<br/>
 <br/>
employing photo and video editing tools,<br/>
<br/>
making our own stop motion animations using clay, chalkboard drawings, found object pieces, drawing, and computer animation,<br/>
<br/>
exploring a huge variety of favourite music on YouTube and Spotify - much of the music first discovered while playing video games.  (Here&#39;s one example of my personal favourites.  I have a lot of favourites.  ;-)  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6PGZskrw-Q)">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6PGZskrw-Q)</a><br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s just off the top of my head, and barely makes a complete list of how video games have enriched our learning.  I&#39;m sure there are ways in which it has done so that I may never fully comprehend.  Such is the nature of learning.<br/>
  <br/>
So you ask us Why...And I ask you, Why not?!  :-)  <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s just so much to explore.  So much more offered today than ever before.  Why wouldn&#39;t young people want to take full advantage of that?  I most certainly and enthusiastically do!  <br/>
<br/>
Some books you might find shift your thinking could include:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Reality is Broken - Why Games Make Us Better and How They Can Change the World&quot; by Jane McGonigal<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Everything Bad is Good For You&quot; by Steven Johnson<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy&quot; by James Paul Gee<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Killing Monsters - Why Children Need Fantasy, Super Heroes, and Make-Believe Violence&quot; by Gerard Jones<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And it also seems that these children whose curiosity was nurtured from babyhood focus their interests on computer games and the rest of the world with its &quot;off the couch&quot; activities don&#39;t seem very exciting after that.?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That has not proven to be a reality in our home.  Although my son clearly loves the learning that happens via video games and other media activities, he also loves exploring anything and everything that sparks his curiosity in the world at large.  It&#39;s not one or the other.  It&#39;s all connected, influencing and enriching every new and familiar experience.  <br/>
<br/>
A simple example of this might be found in a creek bed like the one we found a couple of months ago near home.  Ethan discovered a fairly thick layer of clay.  He was thrilled and started playing with it.  He said &quot;This reminds me of the clay in Minecraft.&quot;  Then he went on to talk about the similarities and differences between real world clay and Minecraft clay, all the while conducting his own experiments with how the clay dissipated in water and flowed downstream, how it clung to the rocks when drawn with, how it could be shaped, and how it could splat and explode on various surfaces.  Then he went home to see how his findings compared to the game design, and talked later about how he would improve the clay properties if he was designing the game himself.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It seems that parents are developing special strategies to get the children out of the house, to get them interested in other activities.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I see it as my responsibility as an unschooling parent to provide my son with the richest learning experience I can, both inside and outside of the home.  I make every effort to surround him with things I know he enjoys doing, and I try to find and introduce new things to our days to see if it (and how it) sparks new connections and curiosities.  <br/>
<br/>
I, by the simple act of being on this earth 32 years longer than my son, have a little more experience in the world.  I have adult friends who share their experiences with me as well.  Consequently, I may know or have access to more of what is out there than Ethan currently does.  (Although, I must admit, he is rapidly catching up, and in some instances bypassing me in knowledge.)  So, I do my best to expose Ethan to information and activities I know and find, not to strategize or manipulate him into doing what *I* want him to, but to offer up some things he might not have known about previously, as well as to help him get his needs met and build on his current interests.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also fun for me.  That&#39;s a bonus.  ;-)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe I&#39;m getting it all wrong and it is not like this at all. After all I don&#39;t live with any of these children and don&#39;t see their intense interest in many other things other then compute games. It just seems that parents often single out playing computer games in their discriptions more than any other activity. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For blog readers out there...I&#39;m wondering if there is a good blog that shows us how an unschooling family lives with, and thoroughly embraces, all the learning technology has to offer while, at the same time, illustrates a greater involvement in the community and the world at large.  I was thinking of authoring one, but I&#39;m not sure if I would be the best candidate.  Maybe there are one&#39;s I&#39;m not familiar with?</div>

activities don&#39;t seem very exciting after that.?*****</span><div><span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br></span></div><div><span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);"><font face="Georgia"><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:15px;">My son (now 10)&nbsp;discovered video games when he was 3 or 4 years old, had the flu, and was home miserable on the couch waiting to be able to breathe well again :-)</span></font></span></div><div><span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);"><font face="Georgia"><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:15px;"><br></span></font></span></div><div><span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);"><font face="Georgia"><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:15px;">We had an old Playstation and a couple of games (Pacman, Tetris) in the basement, so we hooked it up to help distract him and pass the time.</span></font></span></div><div><span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);"><font face="Georgia"><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:15px;"><br></span></font></span></div><div><font face="Georgia"><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:15px;">He loved playing - and over time, we got a Wii, a DS, a PS3 system - then an iPod Touch and an&nbsp;iPad&nbsp;- and more recently, a WiiU. &nbsp;</span></font><span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;">When Pokemon Black came out, he thought Pokemon might be of interest, so we picked up that game - and then many more of the older Pokemon games - and a love of Pokemon began that continues to this day.</span><span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;">&nbsp;</span></div><div><font face="Georgia"><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:15px;"><br></span></font></div><div><font face="Georgia"><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:15px;">All in all, there&nbsp;were video games that he enjoyed and played for hours at a time, day after day - and others that he barely enjoyed for an hour before proclaiming them &quot;not for me.&quot; &nbsp;There were many days when he played video games, and many he did not. &nbsp;I can&#39;t say there was a &quot;balance&quot; because we never added up the hours, but I do know that giving him unlimited access to video games did not turn him into an addict, or a zombie, or anything else so evil and scary sounding as that - just like giving him unlimited access to the TV and Netflix didn&#39;t turn him into an addict, or a zombie…&nbsp;nor in fact did unlimited access to Legos, books, Nerf guns, etc. :-)</span></font><span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;">&nbsp;</span></div><div><font face="Georgia"><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:15px;"><br></span></font></div><div><font face="Georgia"><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:15px;">This summer, he spent many, many hours Minecrafting while FaceTiming or Skyping with friends. &nbsp;Some days, the Minecrafting/FaceTiming would start before breakfast and continue with few breaks until well into the night. &nbsp;Other days, he&#39;d stop for a few hours and we&#39;d go out to the beach or to a park or playground, or we&#39;d get&nbsp;together&nbsp;with friends, or do other such things. &nbsp;Some nights instead of playing, he chose to watch movies or Star Trek episodes or documentaries&nbsp;about&nbsp;the Vikings or Roman history or such (whatever&nbsp;was of interest on a particular day) and he&#39;d ask questions and we&#39;d Google all sorts of information and learn even more interesting things…&nbsp;So even in a summer that was very full of gaming&nbsp;there&nbsp;was still other activity too, even if that other activity was somewhat buried in a sea of crafting&nbsp;and&nbsp;chatting about crafting :-)</span></font></div><div><font face="Georgia"><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:15px;"><br></span></font></div><div><font face="Georgia"><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:15px;">As the summer wrapped up, his interest in Minecraft continued, but suddenly the time he spent playing the game waned and he began asking to go out much more. &nbsp;Somehow along the line of a mostly-gaming-filled few months - probably (I&#39;m guessing) related to trips we took to the beach, walks through nature-filled old cemeteries, etc. - he had developed an intense interest in birding, and the draw of being outside trying to spot a new bird, walking trails, searching for rarities, etc. surpassed the draw to mine and build. &nbsp;</span></font></div><div><font face="Georgia"><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:15px;"><br></span></font></div><div><font face="Georgia"><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:15px;">So now, he plays Minecraft some days not at all, some days for an hour here or&nbsp;there&nbsp;- but mostly he bounces into our room in the morning and asks &quot;So guys, where are we going today???!!!!&quot; immediately upon waking up in the morning, and soon after breakfast he wants to be on the road to a park, wildlife refuge, nature&nbsp;reserve, etc. &nbsp;If he&#39;s not leafing&nbsp;through&nbsp;field guides and picking out birds he&#39;s hoping to see, he usually plays Pokemon or another game on his DS on the way to wherever we&#39;re going - but once we arrive, he leaves the games in the car and heads out into the woods with his binoculars in hand. &nbsp;He has begun to start many conversations with&nbsp;phrases&nbsp;like, &quot;Someday when I work for Audubon….&quot; - or &quot;Someday when I am crawling through the Alaskan tundra stalking&nbsp;good&nbsp;photos of elusive birds…&quot; and though neither his dad nor I have ever suggested a particular career path to him (as we want him to find his own path - if he&#39;s happy as a game programmer, an artist, a gas station attendant, a naturalist, or anything else, his happiness is our priority!), I admit I do smile at the idea of him keeping his love for nature and birds with him into his adulthood :-)</span></font></div><div><font face="Georgia"><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:15px;"><br></span></font></div><div><font face="Georgia"><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:15px;">I could probably write about this forever :-) but I&#39;ll give just one more example of how video games aren&#39;t all-or-nothing with my son (or any other child I know - every child I&#39;ve ever met does have other interests in addition to gaming :-)) -&nbsp;</span></font></div><div><font face="Georgia"><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:15px;"><br></span></font></div><div><font face="Georgia"><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:15px;">This past weekend, he and his dad went to Minecon in Orlando - two whole days of celebrating and enjoying Minecraft. &nbsp;He had really wanted to go&nbsp;and&nbsp;asked us to try to get tickets - which we were lucky enough to be able to do (they&nbsp;sold out very quickly). &nbsp;He loved every minute of the convention (he&#39;s still talking&nbsp;about&nbsp;it now, days later - and he&nbsp;asked us to&nbsp;promise to get tickets to&nbsp;the&nbsp;next one too&nbsp;:-)). &nbsp;But he also asked to take time while in Orlando to go birding, to explore the area, to eat out, etc. &nbsp;There was a gaming area set up at the convention, and my husband and I would have been totally a-ok if he&#39;d wanted to sit and game for 2 days&nbsp;straight&nbsp;- or if he wanted to go to a panel every hour, or chase famous YouTubers for autographs - or&nbsp;whatever&nbsp;would make him happy. &nbsp;But he didn&#39;t want to do only Minecraft-related things. &nbsp;He wanted to be at the convention and meet online friends in real life, tour the exhibits, go to a couple panels - but he also wanted to mix it up by getting out and seeing some of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Orlando area. &nbsp;</span></font></div><div><font face="Georgia"><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:15px;"><br></span></font></div><div><font face="Georgia"><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:15px;">All in all, if we had put pressure on him, or tried to discourage him from spending this summer with Minecraft, or from spending whatever weeks he spent trying to beat Mario Galaxy, or from gaming for&nbsp;exactly&nbsp;as much as he wanted to - if we had said &quot;yes you can go to Minecon but you better do other things too!!&quot; - he wouldn&#39;t have had the experience of making choices of what to do with his time based on what he wants for himself - and we would have been minimizing his interests and his&nbsp;priorities&nbsp;rather than supporting him in what he loves and giving him the opportunity to learn what he likes and how he&#39;s happy spending his time. &nbsp;My husband and I want to raise a child who knows what he likes, and knows that it&#39;s ok to try different things because no one will decide that he Has To do this and he Has Had Enough Of that. &nbsp;And so far, that seems to be what we&#39;re doing :-)</span></font></div><div><font face="Georgia"><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:15px;"><br></span></font></div><div><font face="Georgia"><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:15px;">So I have just chosen to spend the last little while writing this email. &nbsp;My husband chose to cook dinner and read National Geographic rather at the same time. &nbsp;My son is building -&nbsp;</span></font><span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;">yep, in Minecraft :-)</span><span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;">&nbsp;-</span><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:15px;font-family:Georgia;">&nbsp;a scene he&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:15px;font-family:Georgia;">watched yesterday in Seaquest DSV. &nbsp;Each of the three of us chose how to spend our time this&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:15px;font-family:Georgia;">evening</span><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:15px;font-family:Georgia;">, and as a result, each of us is happy and smiling. &nbsp;Works for me :-)</span></div><div><font face="Georgia"><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:15px;"><br></span></font></div><div><font face="Georgia"><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:15px;">Colleen&nbsp;</span></font></div><div><font face="Georgia"><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:15px;">PS For anyone who doubts the value of gaming in the &quot;real world&quot; - or anyone who&#39;d like to see&nbsp;something&nbsp;fun :-) - there&#39;s yet another&nbsp;interesting&nbsp;thing to watch. &nbsp;The UN is using Minecraft in&nbsp;community&nbsp;development in Kenya and other places. &nbsp;If the opening ceremony of Minecon 2013 is on YouTube already, they explain the&nbsp;project. &nbsp;They also talk about it in the older 2012 Opening Ceremony. &nbsp;It&#39;s pretty cool. &nbsp;Minecraft and the UN - a very, very interesting partnership :-)</span></font></div><div><font face="Georgia"><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:15px;"><br></span></font></div></html></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1761035420"><div dir="ltr"><div>I&#39;m so glad Karen S listed those terrific books about the importance of play. Here&#39;s another one that I&#39;d make &quot;required reading&quot; for every parent if I could:<br><br></div><div>- &quot;Play: How It Shapes the Brain, Opens the Imagination, and Invigorates the Soul,&quot; by Stuart Brown. <br>
<br></div><div>There&#39;s all kinds of good stories and research in this book about the importance of unrestricted/controlled play. Brown isn&#39;t writing about videogame playing here, but his principles definitely apply. It turns out that unrestricted play makes people smarter, more socially intelligent, more creative, more adaptable, better problem solvers, and on and on with the positives. On the flip-side, restricting and controlling play among children is NOT a good thing. In fact, extensive research among murderers in prison has shown one thing they all had in common: their parents rigidly controlled their play as children. In particular, Brown studied Charles Whitman, the engineering student who climbed the campus tower at the University of Texas at Austin and shot 15 people, including a pregnant woman. Here&#39;s an excerpt: &quot;But the incredibly thorough investigation of Charlie&#39;s whole life revealed a more surprising factor. After extensive interviews with everyone who had entered Charlie&#39;s life, it became clear that the *lifelong lack of play* had itself been an important factor in his psychopathology.&quot;  (pp 95-96)<br>
<br></div><div>Here&#39;s a related, important point, especially for parents who think they know better than their children what kind of play is good for their children: what is play to one person is not necessarily play for another person. Children are built to learn what&#39;s necessary to survive and thrive as adults in their culture. That&#39;s why so many adolescents today are so drawn to videogame playing. They know instinctively -- often better than their parents -- that computer literacy is critical to their success in their lives as adults. Peter Gray makes that same point in this article, where he compares limiting videogame playing to restricting bow-and-arrow play for a hunter-gatherer&#39;s child: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn/201201/the-many-benefits-kids-playing-video-games">http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn/201201/the-many-benefits-kids-playing-video-games</a><br>
<br>And, finally, I second Karen&#39;s recommendations. I have read some of these books twice!:<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;Reality is Broken - Why Games Make Us Better and How They Can Change the World&quot; by Jane McGonigal<br>
<br>
&quot;Everything Bad is Good For You&quot; by Steven Johnson<br>
<br>
&quot;What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy&quot; by James Paul Gee<br>
<br>
&quot;Killing Monsters - Why Children Need Fantasy, Super Heroes, and Make-Believe Violence&quot; by Gerard Jones &lt;&lt;<br><br></div> -- I would add this article by psychologist, Peter Gray, where he makes the point that restricting videogame playing for our children is like restricting bow-and-arrow play among hunter-gather children: <br>

<h4>BRIAN POLIKOWSKY</h4>
<time> 7 Nov 2013, at  5:05pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1050686234"><html><div style="color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt;">I have been listening to James Paul Gee&nbsp; videos and I absolutely love him and what he has to say about video games and learning is amazing.<br><br>I think a lot of parents with young kids have a lot of fear. They want the best for their children and they want to protect them. <br>It must be a biological thing as baby animals are more vulnerable and parents are their only protection against outside dangers.<br><br>So parents read/hear that Video Games changes brains and they are very scared! Never mind that the more they study it the more&nbsp; it shows that they changes are for the best! That it now only heals the brain but it is amazing for learning.<br><br>Parents read/hear that while watching TV the brain is in an Low Alpha state. OH MY Gosh that must be bad! Never mind that is the same state as a brain in a meditative state is and
 how meditation&nbsp; is considered a wonderful thing!<br><br>Parents read/hear that kids&nbsp; behavior is affected by sugar consumption and that kids go crazy. Never mind that all the studies prove that not to be the case and that young brains need sugar!<br><br>&nbsp;But unschoolers that have been doing this and observing and discussing they&nbsp;&nbsp; have&nbsp; been saying that for a long time because they stopped, thought about it, watch their kids, discussed the ideas, read about it, tried doing it and now&nbsp; they are here sharing what has been their experiences.<br>&nbsp;Why is that important?<br>It is important because children&nbsp; studies are usually&nbsp; correlated to school and school performance, To being away from parents most of the waking hours in an environment that can be hostile and&nbsp; being there many times against their will . Those kids have NO choice.<br><br>Unschooling children do not have that. They have choices, time
 to play and explore, attentive parents, great relationships with parents that partner with them, a rich learning environment&nbsp; as parents are always discussing how, what to bring more interesting things to their lives. <br>&nbsp;<br>This is what was seen here. A parent that is asking because she/.he wants to make sure they are doing their best. That they are providing opportunities, bringing in the world to be explored, that they are being present and participating.&nbsp; Yes there are people who think unschooling parents sit back and&nbsp; let the kids *lead* the way. There is&nbsp; neglect in the worse cases.&nbsp; That is not the kind of unschooling people are talking about here.<br><br>&nbsp;So for parents of young kids I&nbsp; repeat what Sandra has been saying:<br><br>&quot;Read a little, try a little. Wait a while. Watch&quot; and someone added &quot;Repeat&quot; I think!<br><br>I talked about &quot;Safety on the Unschooling Path&quot; this year . It was because I have
 observed so many families with young kids that said they were going to unschool only to go the opposite way once the kids were a little older.<br><br>If you are doing something out of fear it cannot lead you to unschooling better. Knowledge, deep thinking, lots of choices, connection, joy, learning, partnership and&nbsp; a little research maybe and&nbsp; absolutely looking to your kids is a much better path than one full of fear and no choices.<br>Is your child happy playing video games?<br>Is he learning? <br>Is he doing it&nbsp; but has many other choices he can pick and not out of no options?<br>Are you connecting with him and supporting him?<br>&nbsp;Are you feeding his passion with&nbsp; things you bring in that relate to the game? ( books about his games, movies, videos, concerts with video game music, music, instruments like in the game, visiting places, and so much more!)<br><br>&nbsp;Ask yourself those questions and think about them.&nbsp; I
 doubt a parent will still be afraid of video games if they truly&nbsp; look at their children, or join them, and&nbsp; ask themselves those questions.<br><br><br><div><span><br></span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><font face="courier">Alex Polikowsky</font></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.polykow.blogspot.com/"></a>&nbsp;</div><br><div style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt;"><div style="font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:12pt;"><br> </div> </div>  </div></html></div>
