<div id="ygrps-yiv-998114258">I wrote a couple of days ago about trying to get past the occasional<br/>
parental temper tantrum.  Ren wrote back about feeling stressed when the<br/>
house was a mess.  I finally figured it out last night.  I had still been<br/>
hanging on to the notion that the kids &quot;should&quot; help me more around the<br/>
house.  That my priorities &quot;should&quot; be their priorities.  We didn&#39;t have<br/>
chore charts per se.  We would have a meeting in the morning where we would<br/>
talk about what needed to get done that day and take turns picking what we<br/>
wanted to do.  Less strident than a chore chart but required none-the-less.<br/>
<br/>
I finally gave it up yesterday.  Amid crying on my part, I realized that I<br/>
was sending negative energy into our home, aimed at my children, because of<br/>
a silly dirty house.  What a relief to move past that.  I feel liberated!!<br/>
<br/>
So today, my kids have voluntarily cleaned up the mess from lunch, fixed<br/>
Michelle&#39;s hair, helped my find stamps, fed their animals and milked the<br/>
goats.  I was able to look at my child and see the gift of their time and<br/>
energy that they were giving me and feel truly thankful.  Not resentful that<br/>
there are STILL toys on the stairs and having that eclipse the good the kids<br/>
are doing.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again.<br/>

<br/>
Yes. Same here. So all  my tantrums were just useless fits that brought <br/>
negativity into our lives.<br/>
I agree with you.<br/>
I clean for myself now, not to &quot;teach&quot; them how to clean or make them feel <br/>
obligated.<br/>
It calms ME, but not them...so why stress?<br/>
And the house always looks the same, so why bother? Silly, but true.<br/>
Glad to hear of the freedom you are enjoying Julie!!<br/>

children the &quot;proper way things should be&quot; and making them feel <br/>
obligated by her servitude and martyrdom.  I have to fight the <br/>
tendancies I learned as a child as well, and am guilty of plenty of <br/>
tantrums when the kids were not toeing MY line for me.  My mother <br/>
still does that with her grandkids, and it makes me ill.  There is a <br/>
reason my kids do not go to their house much...<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is why *I* stress and maybe someone will have some feedbacvk for me.<br/>
I am the only one who cleans anything. The only one who does dishes, picks up <br/>
toys, trash, food, dishes, everything. The others in the house eat, get up <br/>
and go on to something else. They leave dishes scattered about, empty chip <br/>
bags all over. Clothing is taken off wherever, dropped ont he floor and left. <br/>
Wet towels are left on the beds, barn dirty clothes are lying on the floor, <br/>
toys are played with and left lying on the ground.  Videos are taken out and <br/>
never put back, CD&#39;s are all over the place, The art supplies are used, paper <br/>
is cut into a million pieces and left scattered about. Dirty underwear is <br/>
left on the bathroom floor. The cat box is cleaned by no one but me, Closet <br/>
doors are opened and not shut. Basically we live in a pig sty. I spend my <br/>
days when we are at home cleaning and for a day it is livable, but  that&#39;s <br/>
it.<br/>
I&#39;m at my wit&#39;s end. I have asked for help and asked again. Not in a tantrum <br/>
way, but in a calm manner. Nothing.<br/>
I&#39;m ready to require that the others have chores and stay on them until they <br/>
are done.<br/>
I just can&#39;t take this any more. I need help from them and for whatever <br/>
reason, they are not going to help. This is no longer an issue of my level of <br/>
clean Vs their level of clean. This has developed into a safety and health <br/>
issue. <br/>
I just don&#39;t know what to do.<br/>

and understandably so.  Do the other folks in your family know how much <br/>
this is bugging you?  If you&#39;ve been calm with them about it, they may not <br/>
fully appreciate the level of angst this is causing you.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s good to be honest with the other people in our families about <br/>
our feelings when it comes to stuff like this.  When I talk to Liam in an <br/>
honest way about my feelings without attacking him, he can sometimes be <br/>
helpful.  He won&#39;t always take responsibility for cleaning up after <br/>
himself, but sometimes he will.  But I tell him that I understand it <br/>
doesn&#39;t bother him, but I feel frustrated when...<br/>
<br/>
I do know if I get angry with Liam and fly off the handle about how messy <br/>
it is and how I resent having to pick up after him, he just gets defensive <br/>
(rightfully so) and we get nowhere.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps a little.<br/>

 </span></blockquote> I feel for you Elissa. I have the same problem and feel like the <br/>
house skivvy sometimes. It&#39;s worse when I&#39;m tired and in pain (I <br/>
have MS).<br/>
Sometimes I just lose it and shout and scream and miracuosly <br/>
everyone helps for about 2 days. I shouldn&#39;t need to explode like <br/>
that in order to get help.<br/>
Now that my daughter is 10 she is getting a tiny bit better but they <br/>
still don&#39;t put away after them, they leaves cups and dishes <br/>
wherever they finished eating, there are CD-Roms all over the floor <br/>
and DVD&#39;s. The cats would starve if I didn&#39;t feed them etc etc<br/>
<br/>
DH does help when asked. He fails to notice cat shit in the sink <br/>
until *asked* to clean it up. He doesn&#39;t notice the trash tipping out <br/>
all over the floor until I wearily *ask* him to put the trash out.<br/>
<br/>
Aaaaaaaaarrrrrrrgggggghhhhhhhh.<br/>
<br/>
You need to come over girl and have a moan (if you close your <br/>
eyes and ignore the pig-sty that is).<br/>
I&#39;m free next week.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think they&#39;re seeing this in a different way.<br/>
<br/>
What if you were ranting and raving or talking calmly about spots on the<br/>
garage floor and how you worked and slaved at keeping it spotless and how no<br/>
one else cared. They just tracked muddy prints all over it and left the door<br/>
open for dead leaves to blow in.<br/>
<br/>
Do you think you could convince them to see it your way?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe start small. Say -- in a voice you&#39;d use with a friend! -- &quot;Could you<br/>
bring that cup into the kitchen with you?&quot; &quot;Could you put that back in the<br/>
case and on the shelf for me, please?&quot; That &quot;for me&quot; is important since<br/>
you&#39;re asking them to do something that&#39;s important to you.<br/>
<br/>
Ask one or more if they wouldn&#39;t mind helping you with a specific task, like<br/>
clearing off the coffee table or even a room if it&#39;s not like 2 hours worth<br/>
of work. And do it with them. It&#39;s lonely doing tasks alone. It sems to take<br/>
5 times the time.<br/>
<br/>
Now that my daughter&#39;s 11, she&#39;s much more eager to help than she was.<br/>
She&#39;ll unload groceries from the car and unpack bags when 2 years ago when I<br/>
asked for help it was like I was asking her to hike Mt. Everest for me. ;-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sincerely thanking him -- again, as you would a friend -- for help he does<br/>
do, will get more repeat help than making him feel like he&#39;s not living up<br/>
to your expectations. Turn it around and picture what it would be like if<br/>
you had to face constant disapproval at not meeting up with some<br/>
unreasonable expectations of his. It would suck out some of the joy of home.<br/>
<br/>
Not that your expectations are unreasonable or that he&#39;s reasonable and<br/>
blameless. But getting into a mode of communicating that others aren&#39;t<br/>
meeting up with your standards will make any problems that are already there<br/>
worse. No one will want to put the effort into fixing the problems because<br/>
they&#39;re being shamed and forced into it.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re thinking leaving sounds attractive, it sounds like this deliberate<br/>
ignoring of things that bother you is just a symptom of something that goes<br/>
a whole lot deeper. Have you considered couples counseling?<br/>

<br/>
or<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Beulah, will you please put these towels away when you have a minute?&quot;<br/>
<br/>

If your child (or your husband) is flat-out saying, &quot;No&quot; to the latter, it&#39;s<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-755365946">** Trust me, they have seen the full extent of my unhappiness. The calm<br/>

<br/>
(I wrote the rest of this without having seen all of your posts.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure *I* would have tantrums, too.  Is there another parent in the<br/>
house?  If so I know *I* would be a lot more upset at the lack of<br/>
contribution to housework from an adult partner than I would be a lack<br/>
of contribution from the kids.  Especially if the adult is also throwing<br/>
clothes on the floor.<br/>
<br/>
Some kids are messier than others.  I didn&#39;t clean more than my friends,<br/>
but I was blessed with a kid that didn&#39;t throw stuff around at a rapid<br/>
rate.  (And he was late with scissors so he didn&#39;t make paper &quot;snow&quot; constantly.)<br/>
<br/>
Stuff that makes less mess than full-tilt art and toy projects: playing<br/>
outside (w/o mud), playing Nintendo, watching television, and<br/>
(sometimes) reading and being read to.  Oh, let&#39;s not forget going to<br/>
other people&#39;s houses.<br/>
<br/>
I also see a lot of variation between kids.  A few kids are naturally<br/>
neat and always put the video back in the box, put both shoes together,<br/>
etc.  If you have a few that are at the other end of the spectrum then<br/>
the amount of chaos must be daunting.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think any kid can and will spontaneously clean a bedroom or<br/>
living room that looks like a bomb went off in it.  I think it takes<br/>
years of teaching, modeling, and most importantly cleaning it up with<br/>
them before they are able to do much useful cleaning by themselves. <br/>
(And even then, I can&#39;t promise you that they will want to clean.)<br/>
<br/>
WHATEVER YOU DO, don&#39;t use the tactics that your mother-in-law used to<br/>
teach your husband to do chores.  Her methods sure  don&#39;t seem to work.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you&#39;re willing to remind at all, then I would think perhaps you should <br/>
remind more often, before it gets to the point that you can&#39;t stand it <br/>
anymore.<br/>
<br/>
I have all men in my house, and I do a lot of reminding.  Fortunately, I read <br/>
_How to talk so kids will listen..._ way early in my parenting time and so I <br/>
stick with one word reminders.  For my adult kids who still live here (Jon <br/>
will be 18 in 5 days; Jake, 20, is off at boot camp), I make simple, specific <br/>
lists.  They have always liked this method more than verbal reminders, <br/>
because it feels less like nagging to them.  And it helps because I rarely <br/>
see them when they are working.  I just tape it to their doors.<br/>
<br/>
Over the years they&#39;ve come to realize that it&#39;s just better to do the list <br/>
and pick up their shoes then to wait for me to meltdown.  What I hate is that <br/>
I can never have a break.  It&#39;s like, if I give myself permission to let my <br/>
laundry pile up for a few days, it gives *everyone* permission to let their <br/>
laundry pile up.  There&#39;s no one to take up the initiative if I don&#39;t keep <br/>
on, although dh does do his share most of the time.  Unless I am clearly not <br/>
carrying the load.  Then he has permission to not to do so, either.  Hate <br/>
that part.  Can&#39;t quite describe it, either.  Hope someone here understands <br/>
what I mean.<br/>
<br/>
Jon has a real problem with laundry.  It wasn&#39;t an issue when we had a big <br/>
house and he lived upstairs.  I didn&#39;t go up there much, and when he needed <br/>
something to wear, he washed it first.  Now he lives right next to the other <br/>
two bedrooms and the second bath, and shares it with his little brother.  I <br/>
cannot stand to walk into that bathroom and see all the washcloths in the <br/>
bottom of the bathtub, and his pants and undies all over the floor, and then <br/>
see it in his bedroom, too.<br/>
<br/>
So, I made a (temporary) deal with him.  For my peace of mind, I&#39;ll do his <br/>
laundry--but he has to keep all his dirty clothes in a basket at all times.  <br/>
He has to empty his pockets, and turn his socks right side out, too.  So far <br/>
it&#39;s working.  I told him I was training him, and that eventually he would be <br/>
learning to do his laundry, too.  (He knows how to do laundry, but he has <br/>
trouble with organization.)  Sometimes I feel icky that I&#39;m still doing my 18 <br/>
yo&#39;s laundry, and I wonder if I&#39;ll still be doing it when he&#39;s 25.  But then <br/>
I remind myself that 18 is not a magic number and I try to relax.<br/>

point any human being should be resposible enough to clean up after <br/>
themselves to some reasonable degree.  I am very familiar with how you are <br/>
feeling I think and I personally would seek some kind of good family <br/>
counseling. FAST.  I say good because there is plenty of useless counseling <br/>
out there as far as I am concerned.  This is not just your problem, and I <br/>
think the whole family needs to be invested in solutions.   <br/>
Over the years this has been an issue for me that got worse and worse and <br/>
finally led to a break up. By the time I sought counseling it was really too <br/>
late.  I felt like I was getting used up.  Since two of the five people in <br/>
this house have moved out, things have really changed.  It is really awful <br/>
that in order to relieve the burden it came to that.  I hope you and your <br/>
family will turn this dynamic around.  I will light a candle for you.<br/>

no is an acceptable answer. You&#39;re asking them to help, not disguising a<br/>

something. Even if you don&#39;t think it&#39;s important.<br/>

But, if they&#39;re flat out saying no, just because they have no desire to help<br/>

It&#39;s a real issue, and I can get upset over it.  I always thank my dh when he <br/>
cooks a meal.  No one ever thanks me.  It&#39;s simply expected that I should do <br/>
it.  And so I don&#39;t do it much, because I don&#39;t want it to be expected of me, <br/>
and not appreciated.  I don&#39;t like being taken for granted.  <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, the desired outcome of me not cooking has not been realized.  <br/>
They don&#39;t cook, they don&#39;t thank me when I do, they still accept meals when <br/>
I make them like they expect them.  They&#39;re just dense hunks of testosterone <br/>
laden ingratitude. <br/>
<br/>
I have vowed, however, to cook more for my own pleasure, and to save a little <br/>
money on eating out.  It&#39;s an attitude adjustment...don&#39;t know how long it <br/>
will last.<br/>

concerned about our relationship and to find out from his work about <br/>
counseling. He hasn&#39;t done anything. I have no problem getting myself <br/>

&gt; do <br/>
&gt; it.  And so I don&#39;t do it much, because I don&#39;t want it to be expected of <br/>
&gt; me, <br/>
&gt; and not appreciated.  I don&#39;t like being taken for granted.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is probably most of what I&#39;m feeling. When I left work just before Max <br/>
was born, it was with the agreement that my &quot;job&quot; was homeschooling the kids. <br/>
I spend alot of time on that. I feel as if our agreement has been nullified <br/>
because dh has decided what he wants to do. He thinks now that this is all my <br/>
job. I never agreed to that. <br/>
When I have told him this he just says he works and there fore he shouldn&#39;t <br/>
have to help at all.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I&#39;m at my wit&#39;s end. I have asked for help and asked again. Not in a <br/>
tantrum <br/>
 way, but in a calm manner. Nothing.<br/>
 I&#39;m ready to require that the others have chores and stay on them until they <br/>
 are done.<br/>
 I just can&#39;t take this any more. I need help from them and for whatever <br/>
 reason, they are not going to help. This is no longer an issue of my level <br/>
of <br/>
 clean Vs their level of clean. This has developed into a safety and health <br/>
 issue. <br/>
 I just don&#39;t know what to do. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s time for a temper tantrum!! lol<br/>
I don&#39;t hide it from my kids when I&#39;m getting stressed, I do try to be calm <br/>
but sometimes they have repeatedly ignored pleas for help and I want them to <br/>
know it bugs me.<br/>
Usually, they will help without being asked, but not necessarily in the way I <br/>
think it should be done. That&#39;s fine.<br/>
I ask them to rinse their dishes when they are done eating so when I wash <br/>
them it isn&#39;t hard to do. If they forget too much, I might say something like <br/>
&quot;I am really getting upset that nobody is rinsing their dishes, maybe you <br/>
guys would like to wash them so you understand why I like it!!&quot;<br/>
And if things are a total disaster, I&#39;m not willing to leave sometimes.<br/>
I make it simple though, &quot;let&#39;s do a quick 10 minute clean up before we <br/>
leave&quot; is easier for them to handle.<br/>
We had to leave a huge mess this morning. It was the whole trick or treat <br/>
mess from last night and being up late (as usual), Trevor had a Doctor <br/>
appointment this morning and it&#39;s enough to just get four small people fed <br/>
and ready to go without worrying about mess.<br/>
When we got home I suggested that they find a good movie to watch and I <br/>
started doing dishes.<br/>
I cooked some lunch in between putting dishes away, and served it to them <br/>
while they watched the movie.<br/>
Trevor had been a little traumatized by having the Doctor check his privates <br/>
(necessary due to pain during urination) so I cooked him some major comfort <br/>
food....fried potatoes and scrambled eggs.....and he was very grateful.<br/>
I have no problem standing up for my needs. I just try to be sure I&#39;m not <br/>
forcing my needs to be someone elses, I am fine however with trying to point <br/>
out that my needs are important too, and I try to meet their needs so HELP ME <br/>
OUT HERE!!<br/>
