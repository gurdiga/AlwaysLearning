<div id="ygrps-yiv-1082971814">I hope it is ok for me to ask this, but I would love to find back issues of HEM magazines that anyone is willing to part with.

We are fairly new to unschooling and I have enjoyed reading whatever literature I can get ahold of at our local library, but unfortunately I am unable to check out their magazines.<br/>

about unschooling. My suggestion would be to read John Holt&#39;s books to  <br/>
understand its origins, then read Sandra&#39;s &quot;Big Book of Unschooling&quot;  <br/>
to understand it in practice. Rue Kream&#39;s book &quot;Parenting a Free  <br/>
Child&quot; is also a good read. Some or all of them might be in your  <br/>
library. You could request them, if not.<br/>
<br/>
Print out (if you like paper rather than on-screen reading &lt;g&gt;) pages  <br/>
from Sandra&#39;s site. Joyce Fetterol, Pam Sorooshian, Deb Lewis, and  <br/>
many more respected unschooling &quot;voices&quot; are there.<br/>

I think it&#39;s the only paper-print magazine left that&#39;s not by fundamentalist Christians, so if that&#39;s true, it &#39;s the best of the lot.  There are many advertisements for school-on-DVD, school-on-paper, school-in-workbooks, etc.   <br/>
<br/>
I used to be a columnist, but all my columns are in Moving a Puddle. <br/>

<br/>
For less than a one-year&#39;s subscription (and less than the shipping of a pile of back issues), you can read what was actually about unschooling.<br/>
(There are articles that were published elsewhere, too, but all the HEM columns are in there.)<br/>
<br/>
Then there&#39;s this:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschooling">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a><br/>
and<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1573293840">I had a subscription to HEM for a while but honestly they had maybe one article about unschooling (which was always pretty good), but the rest of it just kind of annoyed me.  Very schoolish. <br/>
<br/>
I would read the unschooling articles in HEM while you&#39;re at the library and save your subscription money for something else (like ice cream ;&gt;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1272491281">I always got the impression that HEM was full of unschooling articles (not because I had any opportunity to really browse through one) but because in reading books by Holt and others, the title would pop up in there somewhere, so I thought maybe I was missing something :)<br/>
Thank you to all of you for helping me to see what it&#39;s not, and for the recommended reading. <br/>
As far as the strewing, I had used the word not as intended. I usually have reading material in the bathroom and wherever I sit to nurse the baby, for the purpose of skimming through while sitting and that is what I meant :)<br/>
Have a great day<br/>
