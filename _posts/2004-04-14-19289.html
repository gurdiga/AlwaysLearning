 <br/>
Hi Folks,<br/>
I apologize for being so behind on this thread. I took a little break from<br/>
reading my digests. I have been preoccupied with Fabric lately - dyeing,<br/>
quilting, making clothes, coveting more fabric...<br/>
I read the digest for the 5th of April and just had to write. I guess a<br/>
light bulb lit up over my head &lt;G&gt;. Quitting things has been a major source<br/>
of upset in our family for years. Quitting was thrown in my face a bunch as<br/>
I was growing up, so of course I felt it was something I should guard<br/>
against with our child. I too would attempt to coax, wheedle, shame, show<br/>
logic, whatever - our sensitive daughter to stick with many activities over<br/>
the years. The ones that come to mind are violin lessons, girl&#39;s soccer,<br/>
Irish dance, Hula, and most of all SCHOOL!<br/>
In looking over some of the reflections from you folks and chewing over some<br/>
of mine, I came to the opinion that our daughter is amazing. She is teaching<br/>
me to unschool. Her clarity about the personal value of any class or group<br/>
activity has always been there. In the early years when she was still in<br/>
school alternative programs; fear, illness and anxiety were the tools she<br/>
had available to exit from an uncomfortable situation. <br/>
Soccer had the same issues for us that I see reiterated here - letting the<br/>
team down, making a commitment,  not being a quitter. In a few years she<br/>
wanted to rejoin the team, but the coach was not interested because he<br/>
needed girls who come to every game. The number of players allowed on each<br/>
team was strictly regulated. Actual consequences in the real world I suppose<br/>
<br/>
I never was able to force her to go to anything once she decided not to go.<br/>
Her clarity and ability to see into other people&#39;s hidden agendas gives her<br/>
a strength of will that was evident from her first years. She has way more<br/>
persistence on these issues than I can manage and now I understand that that<br/>
is so much to the good.  Some activities fit for her, or fit for a while,<br/>
and others just don&#39;t. At first she couldn&#39;t articulate about the details in<br/>
her desire to quit things. She would say she didn&#39;t know why, but she just<br/>
couldn&#39;t be there anymore - or at least  not when she was tired or ill. If I<br/>
pushed, tension and tears and anger were the menu for the rest of the day.<br/>
After we had been homeschool people for several months, she wanted to quit<br/>
Irish dance. I went through all my litany of obstacles to leaving it behind:<br/>
the money invested in classes & costumes, the great homeschool families in<br/>
our dance group, not being a quitter (of course), the opportunities to<br/>
perform regularly. Her response was, &quot;Mom, I thought when we became<br/>
homeschoolers the idea was I would try new things and have new experiences.<br/>
Just because I did the dance for a while doesn&#39;t mean I always have to do it<br/>
 Why can&#39;t I quit this? I loved it for a while, but now it doesn&#39;t feel good<br/>
to be there.&quot; The growing tensions between the parent group and the teachers<br/>
was some of the source of her discomfort there. I felt stunned and proud and<br/>
a bit angry too I guess.  She was better at getting the homeschooling<br/>
mindset than I was &lt;G&gt;. <br/>
In a later conversation about dance I expressed my sadness at not seeing<br/>
those nice families every week. I enjoyed chatting with the moms. Our sweet<br/>
child said firmly to me, &quot;You need to have friends that are not dependant on<br/>
my activities!&quot; <br/>
In looking back at these sorts of upsets, I see a pattern of my unconscious<br/>
personal need to have a child who is liked and respected and even admired. I<br/>
pull a thread in these dramas and see a connection raveling down the<br/>
generations. I was shamed to be a quitter, thus I, ever so obediently<br/>
attempted to shame my child into not being a quitter. I see her now, (maybe<br/>
on a hilltop silhouetted in the sunlight) standing firm - in her self worth<br/>
- in her self awareness - making choices and finding energy to pursue her<br/>
own challenges. Hooray!!!<br/>
Thanks for your sharing you guys, and allowing me the space to get a little<br/>
clearer on how strong and  wonderful our daughter has always been.<br/>
Unschooling on purpose rather than thru lack of organization, and reading<br/>
all the emails and just being full of trust and respect for some months now<br/>
is great (and sometimes difficult). Our daughter seems to be finding new<br/>
perspective and confidence. Old hidden memories of the unhappy tensions and<br/>
boredom and pain in her school years are slowly surfacing. The guilt and<br/>
shame she experienced over leaving school is gradually clearing up. Deep<br/>
sigh...<br/>
Thanks for sharing your journeys,<br/>
Sheri<br/>
