<div id="ygrps-yiv-175727257">I have been in hospitals where they had  &quot;pillow speakers&quot;-little  speaker disks under 3&quot; wide that you  slip under your pillow. Can they be bought anywhere? I always thought they were great. Sure wish people had used them  a couple of years ago when I  had back surgery-the noise  from TV&#39;s in that  area  was unbelievable.<br/>
