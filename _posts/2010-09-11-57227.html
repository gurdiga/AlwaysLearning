<div id="ygrps-yiv-1284639213">HI everyone,<br/>
this is my first time writing anything. I just intorduce myself a bit. My name is Amy and I live in Ireland. I have two children (6 and 3) and I got the idea of unschooling when my second child was born. It wasnt easy I can tell but I couldnt go back anymore since I understood the concept of them being foremost human beings with the same rights as me. Recently I came to the conclusion that I do not want to send my daughter to school if she is not happy about it. And clearly she isnt. But unfortunately I feel I am on my own. i am a single mother, the daddy is not quite there yet and Ireland may allow homeschooling but that is not whats on my mind. So i was looking further and I am hoping to find a community in the UK where I find like minded people who respect their children and are open about a &quot;no school&quot; life. Would anyone know where I can find like minded people in the UK with the same idea? I know its quite specific but that is only in the intrest of my children. I also believe the whole process will run more smoothly if I am not relying on school and co. At the moment I study myself so there is no point in taking my child out of school just yet. So next year would be ideal. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for reading. :)<br/>
<br/>
Have a nice week end.<br/>

I&#39;m not sure what type of environment you live in already (ie city/country?) but I live in London and there are lots of home ed groups everywhere.<br/>
The one I attend in hackney has a few unschoolers within the group. It&#39;s hard to tell how many though as I&#39;m still getting to know everyone!<br/>

You can only do what is allowed.   Unschooling is a way to homeschool,  <br/>
so it&#39;s not a good idea to say &quot;I&#39;m not sending my kids to school and  <br/>
I&#39;m not going to homeschool.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In the 1970&#39;s there was a lot of school reform talk about freeschools  <br/>
and open schools and &quot;the open classroom,&quot; and that&#39;s what we&#39;re  <br/>
doing.  It has educational research behind it, much of it from the  <br/>
1960&#39;s and early 1970&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
When people in stores or out and about asked me why my kids weren&#39;t in  <br/>
school I said &quot;we homeschool.&quot;  That&#39;s what it is, it&#39;s just a more  <br/>
elaborate and harder to describe method than buying a curriculum and  <br/>
playing school at the table.<br/>
<br/>
There are contacts listed here for the UK and Europe, and even if  <br/>
they&#39;re not near you, you could probably ask them for leads.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1459885755">A good place to discuss and look into things like this is here:<br/>
<br/>
Radical Unschoolers Network<br/>
the network for radical unschooling families<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://familyrun.ning.com/">http://familyrun.ning.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
There are interest groups and regional groups you can look for once  <br/>
you&#39;re in there.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it&#39;s not very busy but I wish it were more busy, so maybe  <br/>
anyone here who has an account there and hasn&#39;t posted lately should  <br/>
post something!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes there are complaints that facebook participants forget that  <br/>
others aren&#39;t unschoolers, but on Family Radical Unschoolers Network,  <br/>
they should be unschoolers.  And Radical Unschoolers, too.  Laura  <br/>
Bowman set it up and maintains it.<br/>
<br/>
Partly I&#39;m recommending it because it&#39;s not good to have local  <br/>
discussions on this list, and partly because it&#39;s a fun sort of forum  <br/>
and you can browse through and read what others think of unschooling  <br/>
and why they&#39;re doing it, and see photos of families.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1043697433">Hi sandra,<br/>
<br/>
thanks for the reply. I know what you mean that I cannot boast about I am not sending my kids too school not home school them either. believe me thats not my intention anyway. Still, I like to feel more comfortable to say I do unschooling. But still i feel alone doing it in a country where I dont feel its appriciated much. And I&#39;d say personally for myself I need mental support adn support in itself with sharing ideas. I feel if you are on your own I cannot provide a learning enviroment and offer different ideas. I cannot rely on it but I can tell if I am on my own my children lose out on all the interesting things other places and people can provide, too. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thank you for the website. I will check it out. <br/>

Now, today, you can read more about unschooling than existed in all  <br/>

Here is an index of five sites (one of them is the back issues of  <br/>
growing without schooling).   I fixed this up myself, with google  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1038341676">This is one of my favorite blogs from the UK.  I don&#39;t know the person, I <br/>
stumbled upon it one day.  What I like about it, are the short sweet blogs.  The <br/>
author takes a negative saying about homeschooling and then turns it around with <br/>
a short sweet picture and description. <br/>

In the UK, there is compulsory education, in the US it is compulsory attendance. <br/>
 Within compulsory education, homeschooling is just one choice.  I&#39;m not an <br/>
expert on the laws, it&#39;s an observation that I had.<br/>

California. All of us who call ourselves homeschoolers are really <br/>
private or public schoolers. Unschooling is &quot;legal&quot; (and I would feel <br/>
comfortable defending it in court) because our private schools are not <br/>
regulated as to how children must be educated. As Sandra said, there is <br/>
research supporting this approach to education.<br/>

<br/>
I hadn&#39;t thought of that in relation to homeschooling!  Very good  <br/>
thought!<br/>
<br/>
The reason they changed laws from &quot;compulsory education&quot; to  <br/>
&quot;compulsory attendance&quot; was that some former students and some  <br/>
families sued schools (in the U.S., where lawsuits are like a hostile  <br/>
handshake) because kid grew up without &quot;an education.&quot;  So to cover  <br/>
their butts, the name of what school laws were doing was changed from  <br/>
requiring it to be compulsory that each person get an education, to  <br/>
being compulsory that butts are in chairs, as it were.   (And that&#39;s  <br/>
as it still is.)<br/>

Right after I read that, as I&#39;m doing all these things at the same time:<br/>
watering the yard<br/>
boiling chicken for tomorrow<br/>
making cookies<br/>
playing plants vs. zombies<br/>
listening to Cyril Ritchard read Alice in Wonderland<br/>
checking e-mail as it arrives<br/>
<br/>
this came by:<br/>
&quot;You were not attending,&quot; said the mouse to Alice severely.  &quot;What are  <br/>
you thinking of?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This reminds me that the phrase &quot;school attendance,&quot; in my life,  <br/>
caused me (and millions more, no doubt) to think &quot;attend&quot; means to be  <br/>
there.  Attending a play, attending a concert.<br/>
<br/>
But in the back of my mind I know it means to listen to, to pay  <br/>
attention to someone.  &quot;Attendants&quot; don&#39;t just *be* there.  They pay  <br/>
attention.<br/>
<br/>
Alice wasn&#39;t listening to the mouse because she was thinking of  <br/>
something else, and because she likes cats and dogs more than she  <br/>
likes stories about the history of why a mouse doesn&#39;t like cats or  <br/>
dogs, and so she had zoned out, thinking.<br/>
<br/>
If unschooling involves whatever is most interesting in the moment, my  <br/>
children have had perfect attendance for many years!  Maybe I should  <br/>
make them something like this:<br/>

<br/>
While I was looking for that, this whole post became a blogpost with  <br/>
more commentary and a video of Cyril Ritchard doing Captain Hook&#39;s  <br/>
Waltz from the American musical of Peter Pan.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>its hard for me to explain. No i dont want my children to go to school. But I am prepaired to move. And thats what I mean wioth community. I would liek to live with people who are like minded. So my children have more people around them. They have more possibilities to learn (and I know its then up to them what they want to learn, I dont want to interfere directly). In the area I am now living in, people already look weird, when my kids only play outside in underwear, when they dont wear jackets when its raining and worst of all go to the playground on their own. People here fear bad things. In a way i think thats poison for my children. And thats why I like to move away from it. So its first of all twice as hard to stick to it (and fear of them reporting me to the social workers for neglect) and that I think can be stopping my children from making positive experiences. In a community there are different people (if likeminded but still different).<br/>
<br/>
I was very much raised in the old fashion way so for me its hard hard to let got and I feel not up for it on my own. Thats why I want to have this support of other people. I dont know if that makes sense. <br/>

<br/>
thanks for your reply. I am based in Bray, County Wicklow, South of Dublin. I would be glad if you could help me out here.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing, is it possible to unschool (homeschool) when you are a single mother relying on the goverments money. Ideally I think, it helps if i live in a commune (i hope that is the right word now)and can support them with my skills. If I&#39;d be working I have to have people taking over my childrens education or mind them in a way.<br/>

without jackets in the snow (we don&#39;t get much rain), and go to the  <br/>
park alone (if the kids were really young), I would be embarrassed.   <br/>
And if I spoke to the mom and she said &quot;But we&#39;re unschoolers!&quot; I  <br/>

neglect.   There&#39;s no advantage to anyone.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve lived comunnally and while I enjoyed that, community living isn&#39;t a magic bullet for unschooling. If anything, it provides a whole &#39;nother set of challenges, the kind you get when you&#39;re trying to unschool while living with people who don&#39;t understand what you want to do or why. In that sense, its rather like living with extended family. <br/>
<br/>
Communities form because of shared Adult values, and that only leaves room for supporting natural learning when kids are perfectly sanguine about those adult values. The positive stories I&#39;ve heard about unschooling in community have stressed that its vital for parents to advocate for their kids against the community as a whole - its do-able, but its not easier or better, necessarily, than living anywhere else. You don&#39;t get the perfect village, you get a bunch of human beings with histories and baggage, most of whom are absolutely sure that &quot;respecting children&quot; means teaching them lessons about respect and &quot;natural learning&quot; means no plastic toys or electronics.<br/>
<br/>
The best fit for unschoolers in community - for anyone who may be looking - is something closer to an eco-village setup. Basically, the more independent your family is from the community, the less chances for conflict concerning how you&#39;re raising your kids. Income sharing communities are the least likely &quot;fit&quot; for unschoolers, as those will have the most ideological expectations as to how community members and their children spend their time. <br/>
<br/>
Its not impossible to unschool in community, but its not an ideal, either. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-321383032">I know nothing about communes in the UK. This isn&#39;t a list that is about <br/>
searching for communes in the UK. My guess is that you need to search beyond the <br/>
boundaries of an unschooling list that is largely read by folks in the U.S. in <br/>
order to find a commune that will support you in the ways in which you desire. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to unschool, if you want to home-educate, if you want to go outside <br/>
the bounds of that which is normal, you are going to be questioned and people <br/>
will wonder at your decisions. In order to maintain your privilege of <br/>
home-educating your children in a country that to some extent sees children as <br/>
the responsibility of the state, which is certainly true in Britain although I <br/>
don&#39;t know about Ireland, than letting a 6 year old go to the park on her own <br/>
shouldn&#39;t be among your first options. Having two children and only one adult in <br/>
a situation with little money to get others to help means that you have to come <br/>
up with ways to engage both of them in an activity. Find things that your 3 year <br/>
old would like doing at the park sometimes and find things your 6 year old would <br/>
like doing at home sometimes. Unschooling is about looking for solutions to <br/>
problems, it&#39;s about connecting with your children more. Letting a 6 year old go <br/>
to the park on her own may seem like it&#39;s harkening back to older values, but it <br/>
can put your whole set of choices at risk of being not only questioned but <br/>
removed. Even if it doesn&#39;t feel like neglect, it is better to be more actively <br/>
looking for solutions that aren&#39;t about your children forging off on their own <br/>
at young ages. <br/>

<br/>
If you&#39;re doing this on your own, the only rules you need to contend  <br/>
with are local laws.<br/>
<br/>
Communes add another (often very deep) set of rules and immediate  <br/>
feedback, and the ever-present risk of expulsion from the commune.  If  <br/>
a commune decides all the children will do this, or that, that&#39;s hard  <br/>
to buck.  If you live where homeschooling is legal, then you have the  <br/>
law on your side.<br/>
<br/>
I am guessing you don&#39;t live where public nudity or six year olds  <br/>
unattended in public places are acceptable.<br/>
<br/>
My kids played naked in the back yard, in water or in mud or the sand  <br/>
box, up to the time they were five or so, but not in the front yard.   <br/>
There really is a difference.<br/>
<br/>

6. If she wants to go to the playground and my young one doesnt want  <br/>

<br/>
I had three children in a five and a half year span and managed to  <br/>
keep them together, or traded out with friends for childcare, or left  <br/>
one with my husband to take the other two somewhere.   Some people  <br/>
have five kids, or seven, but they don&#39;t just say &quot;oh well&quot; if they go  <br/>
in that many different directions.<br/>
<br/>
-=-So if my daughter wishes it why stop her from doing it? Or do I  <br/>
misunderstand? She feels proud of doing things on her own. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re misunderstanding in a way that others have before too.   <br/>
Becoming an unschooler doesn&#39;t change one&#39;s relationship with the  <br/>
outside world.  It doesn&#39;t give anyone a pass to behave differently in  <br/>
museums or stores or at other people&#39;s houses.  Just inside your own  <br/>
home.  It&#39;s not about changing other people&#39;s beliefs and practices,  <br/>
but about changing our own.<br/>
<br/>
Jenny Cyphers wrote something nice, this morning or last night, at the  <br/>
Radical Unschoolers Network ning, and I saved my favorite part:<br/>
&quot;Just like ALL learning, learning how to live comfortably and happy  <br/>
are really wonderful things. It takes a focus on turning away from  <br/>
what you know you don&#39;t like and turning towards something else, that  <br/>
something else that creates happy learning and living. Unschooling  <br/>
really is a shift in thinking and then acting on it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Turning toward something else&quot; should be something immediate and  <br/>
doable, though, not a commune that probably doesn&#39;t exist.  Meredith  <br/>
is absolutely right about this:   &quot;You don&#39;t get the perfect village,  <br/>
you get a bunch of human beings with histories and baggage, most of  <br/>
whom are absolutely sure that &quot;respecting children&quot; means teaching  <br/>

communities and has a directory. I think you&#39;ll find more help there if <br/>
what you&#39;re looking for is a communish type of living arrangement. There <br/>
are such groups in the US and probably elsewhere, I&#39;ve know a few people <br/>
who lived in them and I bet there are a few on this list. But this list <br/>
is about unschooling, not about communal living. Most communes or <br/>
intentional communities don&#39;t involve unschooling or even homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers are idiosyncratic and often have strong personalities (kids <br/>
and parents) -- living in close quarters with a big group of unschoolers <br/>
never sounded very appealing to me. I may love that they can raise their <br/>
own families in their own unique ways, but their ways are not <br/>
necessarily going to be comfortable for me and my family.  My kids would <br/>
drive some other families crazy to live with on a daily basis. &quot;I&quot; would <br/>
drive some others crazy. Some people are relaxed and easy going and <br/>
their idea of a good day is to take a long walk in the woods, maybe swim <br/>
a little, bake some bread, do some puzzles together. In the meantime, my <br/>
family would be wanting to go to a show, a museum, a festival, or <br/>
something.  Or - my family might be into debating current events and <br/>
arguing issues and another family might be trying to withdraw from <br/>
contention and practice finding commonalities. Etc. My point is that <br/>
unschooling doesn&#39;t make us compatible for living together.<br/>

<br/>
You also cannot stop someone from calling the authorities if they think you are <br/>
being a neglectful parent.  Within any neighborhood there will likely be a busy <br/>
body person that wants to police the community.  That&#39;s been the case in almost <br/>
every neighborhood I&#39;ve lived in.<br/>
<br/>
Even if you get investigated and are found innocent, it puts fear in your lives <br/>
that need not be there.  If the prevention is as easy as keeping kids in <br/>
clothing and going to the park with them, it seems a better option to do that <br/>
than risk the other.<br/>
<br/>
Most people in my neighborhood consider homeschooling to be something strange <br/>
and foreign, and we live in a very homeschool friendly place.  I don&#39;t want to <br/>
socially ostracize myself and my family by behaving and being such a way that <br/>
all my neighbors find us so out there that they won&#39;t allow their kids to play <br/>
with mine.  Sometimes that might be a blessing... depending on what the neighbor <br/>
kids are like!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-836907328">***People here fear bad things. In a way i think thats poison for my children. <br/>
And thats why I like to move away from it. So its first of all twice as hard to <br/>
stick to it (and fear of them reporting me to the social workers for neglect) <br/>
and that I think can be stopping my children from making positive <br/>
experiences. ***<br/>
<br/>
I understand that.  I don&#39;t like how fearful our culture has become.  It can <br/>
drive parents crazy with worry that there are child abductors hiding behind <br/>
every bush, or online predators lurking around every site your child might <br/>
visit.<br/>
<br/>
That, to me, seems to be a different issue than fear of social workers.  One <br/>
need not be neglectful to not live in fear.  This isn&#39;t an unschooling site, but <br/>
it&#39;s an interesting one about raising children outside of that fear <br/>
base... <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://freerangekids.wordpress.com/">http://freerangekids.wordpress.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
Yet, all of that isn&#39;t unschooling.  Unschooling is certainly turning away from <br/>
a system, but it doesn&#39;t involve neglect and shouldn&#39;t involve anything that <br/>
looks like neglect.  It&#39;s more about happy learning than letting kids run around <br/>
by themselves or run naked in the front yard.  Those are individual things that <br/>
are pretty contextual.  <br/>
<br/>
Our family lives one block from a HUGE 70 acre park with 7 playgrounds, the <br/>
nearest being at the entrance near our house.  I wouldn&#39;t let my 9 yr old go <br/>
there alone, but I would let her go with a group of kids from the neighborhood, <br/>
if they all knew to stick together and I could trust them to do that.  The kids <br/>
in our neighborhood that my daughter plays with range in age from 4-11.  I&#39;d <br/>
also let her ride her bike to the mini mart 2 blocks away if she was with at <br/>
least one other person.<br/>
<br/>
When she was 4 yrs old, she needed to stop running around naked because most of <br/>
the kids in our neighborhood at the time were older kids who found it <br/>
disturbing.  We did it just as much to protect her from being teased as we did <br/>
to make our neighbor kids comfortable.  Whatever I may have felt about 4 yr olds <br/>
being naked, the reality was that I cared about how others felt too.  I don&#39;t <br/>
live in a world away from others.<br/>
<br/>
People who choose to live communally come from the same culture that all the <br/>
rest of us do, they carry many of the same baggage.  Even those that seek <br/>
another way to live will still have grown up in a culture that they are choosing <br/>
to avoid.  So, I guess it depends on what the intentional community core values <br/>
are and whether they mesh with unschooling or child rearing, in general.<br/>
<br/>
My own experience having lived with other families, both while I was a kid and <br/>
as an adult with kids, is that the other families may be the most wonderful <br/>
people and friends in the world, but that everyone parents differently and that <br/>
it can create conflict in even the best of the best situations.<br/>
