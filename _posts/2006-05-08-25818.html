Not sure why you mention &#39;guy-style&#39;. Don&#39;t see the relevance, unless that<br/>
was meant as a dig. If so, I&#39;m curious to hear your characterization of<br/>
guy-style...**<br/>
<br/>
I thought I had a good idea what she meant. To me the style (that stands out a mile) in this more than 90% female forum is highly logical, highly competitive, makes a lot of references to outside authority, is often condescending and doesn&#39;t say much about the posters actual children (if there are any, I think I&#39;ve heard from some condescending non-parents before).  These characteristics seem to go along in tandem with a lack of respect for anecdotal experience.  The know-it-all style of guy (a subset) gives theory a shining prominence over reality.  I think this style that I&#39;ve seen here (or on related lists and boards) from several guys is quite a bit like a &quot;professorial style&quot;.  One can almost picture the unlit pipe. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In a forum with hundreds of members, you can&#39;t reasonably be 50% of the conversation.  Posting with that kind of frequency in the beginning really attracts attention.  Attention with perhaps a pinch of aggravation thrown in, though other listmembers are doubtless more saintly than I am.<br/>

Condescension is rarely my intent. And when it is, I generally feel lousy<br/>
the next day.<br/>

Radical unschooling is a particularly interesting and counterintuitive<br/>

on this list. I see I could do better with my tone, so any concrete<br/>
constructive feedback is welcome off list.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s experience, not bias. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Men communicating with and among men have certain traditions and  <br/>
expectations.<br/>
Mixed groups communications have other traditions and expectations.<br/>
<br/>
This is NOT a particularly &quot;girlie&quot; conversation, except for the  <br/>
aspect of emotion involving our children.  But still, even though it  <br/>
wasn&#39;t designed as a women&#39;s group, most primary unschooling parents  <br/>
are moms (the dads rarely discover it first, though it does happen).   <br/>
So the tone and expectations are those that women have of women&#39;s  <br/>
interactions.  That&#39;s also experience, and not anything that&#39;s  <br/>
usually analyzed in any depth.  It just is what it is.<br/>
<br/>
Communicate the way you naturally do, but don&#39;t be surprised or  <br/>
offended if people can tell you&#39;re male without you saying so.   <br/>
Nearly half the people in the world are males.  We&#39;re all used to it.<br/>

For all of us, at the beginning.   It&#39;s not so much counterintuitive  <br/>
as counter to the voices that say &quot;must&quot; and &quot;if not, then...&quot;<br/>
People have their intuition trained out of them in this culture, so  <br/>
it&#39;s a wonder anything can be intuitive.<br/>

<br/>
To me, the devil&#39;s advocate approach reads like a detached attempt to poke the group&#39;s hot buttons for personal entertainment.  (Similar to what trolls do, and somewhat disruptive as most of us are here to become better parents, not just to pass the time.)  <br/>
<br/>
I mentioned in my last post on this thread that I think a common denominator in the &quot;guy style&quot; of many new male posters is &quot;competitiveness&quot;.  When someone comes here, and all they do is (metaphorically) stand at the net and volley the tennis ball back  defensively, it looks like they are here to &quot;win&quot; rather than to learn.  People of any gender who come here believing that they are &quot;right&quot; and sounding very invested in continuing to be right and perhaps hoping to *prove* that unschooling is wrong and ridiculous fairly often behave this way.  I&#39;m guessing (now) that this isn&#39;t your intention, but somehow when you made your debut here you did resemble at least partially the argumentative-dismissive profile.  (If you want to see what I see, try going up thread and rereading your first 5 or 6 posts.  Now that you&#39;ve read here awhile, can you see how your posts have a different flavor than the average post?  And if you WERE feeling defensive or flustered or irked when the thread came around the first time, I think you&#39;ll find a lot of value in rereading the responses to your questions.  Or in searching the archives for related previous answers.  Stuff that didn&#39;t make sense before is likely to make sense now.)<br/>
<br/>
**<br/>
At some point, you see the moderator refer backhandedly to another woman who<br/>
has left the group in a storm as acting typically of those with vaginas.**<br/>
<br/>
I think you are mischaracterizing what was said.  (Another reason for a reread.  I recall personally using the words &quot;comptetive&quot;, &quot;rational&quot; and probably &quot;condescending&quot;, with some generalizing wiggle words and handwaving attributing those words to &quot;some&quot; guys in general, but not saying every bit was an exact fit for you.  Sandra used the phrase &quot;guy style&quot;.  I don&#39;t recall explicit mentions of genitalia.<br/>
<br/>
These are my recollections and opinions, not necessarily that of any other reader.  I&#39;m happy to drop it now, as it is kind of off topic.  (I don&#39;t need to win, but wanted to take a shot at having you hear me.)<br/>
