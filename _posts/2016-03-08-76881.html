<div id="ygrps-yiv-427352601">For several months there were no chats (text chats).  Then Feedburner lost the subscription list somehow.<br/>
This is the announcement for this Thursday’s chat.  If you’re interested in chats, please go to the announcements blog and subscribe; I won’t always announce them here, but would like to let people who used to be subscribed know that they might want to subscribe anew.<br/>

March 10 chat topic: Finding and Maintaining Joy<br/>
<br/>
For those who want to warm up in advance, there&#39;s this short article on my site: Rejecting a Pre-Packaged Life, that&#39;s about finding enjoyment in everyday things.    <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/joy">http://sandradodd.com/joy</a><br/>

In a podcast in which she interviewed me, Pam Laricchia said she named her website &quot;Living Joyfully&quot; because of that article. Here is that interview:  Ten Questions with Sandra Dodd  <br/>

and here&#39;s something Pam wrote about maintaining joy by choosing positive friends over negative, critical ones:  Joy is a Beacon for Community and Growth  <br/>
