<div id="ygrps-yiv-1057621576">I had to write about this cuz it is so cool.  We have been enjoying the <br/>
cartoons now with our dd, especially Invader Zim which she loves, since <br/>
you guys set us straight over the weekend.  Well, we went to the bank <br/>
yesterday and one of the tellers gave her a little notepad.  On the way <br/>
home my dd drew amazingly accurate pictures of Zim on several of those <br/>
little notepad sheets!  From memory!!  Over the last 2 days now she has <br/>
drawn almost all of the characters from that program, and is loving <br/>
it.  She also found a cartoon drawing class offered at the library when <br/>
we were there last night, and signed up for it.  This might not of <br/>
happened had we continued to try to curtail her cartoon interest.  With <br/>
acceptance, it has opened doors.  :-)   We are amazed!!<br/>
   I also wanted to add, I told my dh that I had put on the last post <br/>
that it wasn&#39;t a good idea to write a post when you were extremly <br/>
frustrated.  He disagreed and said the only way he was able to get <br/>
his &quot;mind shift&quot; was by having people point out to him how such a <br/>
negative attitude was affecting his relationship with his dd.  Thanks <br/>
again.  This way of life never ceases to amaze me.</div>
