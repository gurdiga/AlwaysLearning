&gt;&gt;It is so strange that people are NOT Talking about these things on the<br/>
&gt;&gt;American lists. Not a mention of duck tape or plastic, as if that would<br/>
&gt;&gt;help, honestly. What is up with this?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I dunno!  There is a lot of fear around this whole thing, and I think<br/>
&gt; people may feel powerless to do anything about it and not want to<br/>
&gt; acknowledge it.  But &quot;I dunno&quot; is the only *correct* answer I can come up<br/>
&gt; with.  I know that I feel sensitive about bringing this topic up on this<br/>
&gt; list and the unschooling list because I don&#39;t want to cause a diversion<br/>
&gt; from the unschooling topics.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t talk about it on homeschooling lists because I&#39;m not interested in<br/>
debating it. :) I&#39;m also not feeling any more afraid or powerless over this<br/>
than anything else.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind posts like Marji&#39;s and I don&#39;t fret over them just because<br/>
we&#39;re on different sides of this particular issue. I would find it tedious<br/>
if pro or anti war posts became the order of the day on any of the lists I<br/>
frequent, but we seem to find other things to talk about, too, and I have a<br/>
good working delete key. :)<br/>
