<br/>
There are only six weeks left until the weekend of The Autodidact Symposium, and it&#39;s not too late to register! Remember, at the end of February the price jumps, so get your info in soon! Beautifully hand-drawn t-shirts are also available! <br/>
<br/>
The Symposium offers mentorship, inspiration, and support to passionate young people while also informing novice unschoolers about the movement and bringing like-minded families and friends together for a weekend of fun, excitement, friendship, learning, and growth. For ALL the information regarding the Symposium, visit our website! <br/>
