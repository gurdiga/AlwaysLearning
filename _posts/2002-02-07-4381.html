&gt;Thanks for letting us know, Sandra. FYI for everyone...I had a copy of that <br/>
&gt;poem Ren was looking for and have sent it to her email.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ren, I&#39;m sorry to hear about your mother...even though you&#39;re not <br/>
listening right now, I hope you feel this good vibe being sent out.<br/>
<br/>
Would someone mind posting the poem?<br/>

&gt;A few years ago--actually, more than a few years ago--Eric (dh) was waiting<br/>
&gt;at a stop light behind someone who finished eating something and threw the<br/>
&gt;wadded-up wrapping out the car window.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t always have the opportunity to get out and do what Eric did, but <br/>
I *always* honk the horn and point at people and let them know that I <br/>
SAW them throw out the cigarette butt or the McDonald&#39;s bag.  <br/>
<br/>
They think no one is looking, so no one cares.  I don&#39;t want them to <br/>
think that anymore.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Here it is. I think it&#39;s the one she was looking for . It&#39;s the one Lisa <br/>
Bugg sent out with her final newsletter. BTW I finally got over to <br/>
unschooling.com and it looks like Ren is going to be getting lots of copies <br/>
in her mailbox. :-/ Hope she feels cared for and not overwhelmed.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;The Grace of Crabs<br/>
 </span></blockquote>   by Jan Provencial<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Deep calls unto deep at the noise of you waterfalls;<br/>
&gt;all your waves and billows have gone over me.<br/>
&gt;Psalm 42:7<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve been watching sand crabs plunge into the ocean.<br/>
&gt;They come from nowhere-up-ahead of me<br/>
&gt;and fling themselves off the two-foot sandcliff<br/>
&gt;sculpted by last night&#39;s high tide.<br/>
&gt;Their clawed legs gallop like slender fingers<br/>
&gt;running scales on a piano.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The sea come to meet them,<br/>
&gt;a bubbling rush of foam.<br/>
&gt;On contact, the crabs pull in their claws,<br/>
&gt;allow themselves to float and be dragged away.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What violent surrender is must be to be greeted<br/>
&gt;and held by something so immense,<br/>
&gt;free from all attachments;<br/>
&gt;The ache of heart-rope tied<br/>
&gt;so tight<br/>
&gt;around my baby son,<br/>
&gt;who crawls oblivious toward the water,<br/>
&gt;and to my four year-old daughter<br/>
&gt;who, past exhaustion, runs into the waves,<br/>
&gt;over and over,<br/>
&gt;protected only by a pair of water wings.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I snatch them back again and again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And wonder:<br/>
&gt;will I know how to abandon<br/>
&gt;my burrowed home in the crumbling sand<br/>
&gt;and leap out,<br/>
&gt;not held by gravity or love,<br/>
&gt;forgetting all resistance ,<br/>
&gt;to be embraced by vast deeps,<br/>
&gt;never looking back?<br/>

when she resigned unschooling.com leadership.<br/>
----------------<br/>
My friend, Jan, had to do the final letting go this December.  Her children<br/>
<br/>
were given a measurable amount of time with their mother and immeasurable<br/>
<br/>
gifts by her life.   Those who knew her were given touches of strength and<br/>
<br/>
grace.  All I could wish for you in the coming new year is a smidgen of her<br/>
<br/>
courage as you face your families needs of release and growth.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In tribute to my friend,  Jan Provencial,  I close my final newsletter with<br/>
<br/>
one of her poems.<br/>
