<div id="ygrps-yiv-666458299">Regardless of whether spanked kids are more violent or not, we know that<br/>
adults who are spanking children are practising violence.  I don&#39;t like<br/>
violence--real violence because I don&#39;t like it when people get hurt,<br/>
especially children.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think studying children t o see whether they are more or less<br/>
violent is as interesting as trying to understand why adults are so violent<br/>
towards the most vulnerable members of society--small children!  Hiting<br/>
anyone nonchalantly to &quot;correct&quot; behaviour is ridiculous--try substituting<br/>
the word women with the word children and see how it sounds:  women in<br/>
cultures where men smack their wives or hit them with sticks no wider than<br/>
their thumbs are much&quot; less likely to exibit more violent behaviour than<br/>
their peers&quot; whose spouses speak to them respectfully and see where that<br/>
conversation goes:-)<br/>
<br/>
Alternately, try it with various minority group/ethnic groups and see how<br/>
that sounds.  It sounds horrific, barbaric and not conducisve to building<br/>
trust or working together to meet everyone&#39;s needs.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It may not be saying what it first appears to be saying. &quot;Exhibit&quot; is a key word here (what can be observed and counted). In a culture where spanking is used to force compliance by breaking a child&#39;s spirit, the child most likely, in my experience, wouldn&#39;t exhibit any violent behaviour at all for fear of another spanking. Measuring that against even only very occasional violence from a child who isn&#39;t spanked, I could easily suggest that my research shows (nurtureshock horror!) a spanked child is actually less violent than an unspanked child (and child managers masquerading as parents would perhaps be happily nodding their heads) but it would be an interpretation of what&#39;s actually happening not the whole story. The whole story upon investigation might turn out to be very different.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My notes on that were a little cryptic. I said I was sure I goofed up something, and I think that was it. :) I guess at best that was unclear. Sorry! I *think* what it said was, in African-American families, spanking is more common. Whether the kids are spanked or not is not really an indicator or whether they will exhibit violent behavior elsewhere like it is in American culture as a whole. Because the punishment is not seen as taboo, it is less emotionally traumatic to the kids. In a culture where spanking is seen as horrible, kids are likely to feel like there is something really wrong with them if mom snaps and spanks them. <br/>
<br/>
Hopefully someone else read this too. Honestly it might have said African-American kids who are spanked more are less likely to get in trouble. Having worked in a very depressed, predominantly African-American neighborhood, I can believe it. Not to conflate African-American culture with poverty across the board, but when there is a lot of crime literally right outside your door, having parents who are highly involved and let you know what kind of behavior they think is right, even if they spank, can be a big factor in keeping out of trouble. All us liberal white suburban Americorps volunteers working there had the luxury of being sympathetic to the plight of the prostitutes, but the moms of little girls in the neighborhood had to tell the kids straight up that that behavior was not acceptible under any circumstances. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t spank, and I wish other people were given better parenting skills than that. I do respect that some people are doing the best with what they know, as opposed to just being shitty child abusers. <br/>

parents were less likely to be violent.<br/>
<br/>
In that environment the non-spanking group probably had a higher  <br/>
proportion of drug abusers and absent parents. And of the other non- <br/>
spankers, what parenting were they replacing spanking with? It&#39;s not  <br/>
safe to assume it was mindful parenting! The spanking group probably  <br/>
had a higher proportion of parents who were aware of what their kids  <br/>
were doing and who drew the line about acceptable and not-acceptable  <br/>
behavior.<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s the same thing unschoolers have found: if you pay attention to  <br/>
your kids they turn out better than if you let them raise themselves!<br/>

<br/>
Sure.  It&#39;s not a mean book at all.   He&#39;s just a little too  <br/>
worshipful of studies for my tastes.  But that&#39;s the intent of the  <br/>
book, to report on studies that might be surprising.  Unfortunately,  <br/>
he and the researchers have the same-old over-reaction, it seems to  <br/>
me... that everything should be changed totally and immediately  <br/>
because of a study.<br/>
<br/>
As to the spanking thing, one bad thing about audio books is the  <br/>
inability to look at the table of contents and stick a bookmark in a  <br/>
different place!! &lt;g&gt;  I really can&#39;t just listen full out to that  <br/>
book.  I need recovery time.    BUT to the spanking situation, I keep  <br/>
thinking about it, and without hearing the setup of the study, I&#39;m  <br/>
wondering whether it&#39;s a correlation of parents who are present and  <br/>
paying attention.   Did they compare stable families with and without  <br/>
spanking, and the outcome?  Or are they comparing stable families  <br/>
trying to keep urban kids out of trouble to broken, inattentive  <br/>
families?  That would be a different deal.<br/>

I think of that quite a bit, and sometimes say &quot;Because we&#39;re not in a  <br/>
war zone...&quot;  Many of the unschooling practices are pure luxury.   <br/>
Staying up late wasn&#39;t an option before electric lights, and isn&#39;t  <br/>
possible in places with blackout policies during wars.  When my mom  <br/>
was a kid there were mandatory black-out drills, and air-raid alarms  <br/>
which meant home, inside, blackout.  That wasn&#39;t optional.<br/>
<br/>
Letting kids try different foods is only possible when and where there  <br/>
ARE different foods.<br/>
Letting kids say &quot;no thanks&quot; to food is only feasible when the parents  <br/>
know there will be more food later.<br/>
<br/>
Being picky about how animals are raised or how food is grown is a  <br/>
huge luxury.<br/>
It&#39;s a side benefit of peace and plenty.<br/>

response to something sensible, about internet comments and discussions.<br/>

&quot;I feel the inherent anonymity of the internet is one of its most  <br/>

what&#39;s being said. If we treat it neutrally as a resource to gather  <br/>
information and opinions off of, we can use it and change accordingly.&quot;<br/>

one of the videos Lee Stranahan did are.  It wasn&#39;t my facebook post;  <br/>
it&#39;s no one Bo knows, but he jumped in anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Just because it&#39;s grammatical doesn&#39;t mean it makes sense.  He&#39;s a  <br/>
good artist, but not a linear thinker.  His mom&#39;s a teacher (special  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-86684553">I wondered who Bo was when I read your last comment in that thread,<br/>
thinking that it couldn&#39;t be Bo King. It looks like he may have<br/>
deleted his words before I read them. (Now I&#39;m curious what he said<br/>
but any hey...) Holly&#39;s 4 years behind having to listen to most of<br/>
what passes for high school instruction droning on and on and on<br/>
endlessly. ;) So glad she gets to breathe the free air instead. Karl<br/>
too. And so many other kids. They probably don&#39;t know what it means to<br/>
be relieved to be out of school for the summer. Gosh they&#39;re missing<br/>

&gt; Just because it&#39;s grammatical doesn&#39;t mean it makes sense.  He&#39;s a<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2101448200">I think the reason the study doesn&#39;t make sense is because spanking is<br/>
the one obviously wild card in an otherwise stable situation/setup.<br/>
The one thing that muddied the waters of what otherwise could have<br/>
been clearly understood as a parent&#39;s love.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;BUT to the spanking situation, I keep<br/>
thinking about it, and without hearing the setup of the study, I&#39;m<br/>
wondering whether it&#39;s a correlation of parents who are present and<br/>
paying attention.   Did they compare stable families with and without<br/>
spanking, and the outcome?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Not a study, but an anecdote from my life... spanking didn&#39;t keep me<br/>
out of trouble. I got into plenty of that, hence the spankings. The<br/>
thing that kept me from getting into drugs, for instance, was not only<br/>
the fear of spankings --which had dwindled almost to nothing by the<br/>
time drugs were a consideration-- but also the fear of more parental<br/>
disapproval and the potential presented to us kids in continued<br/>
threats of parental rejection. I wouldn&#39;t call it parental involvement<br/>
but a supreme form of Skinnerism put in terms of Strong Willed<br/>
children via the likes of James Dobson, whose advice really was<br/>
listened to and followed. The term &quot;tough love&quot; describes the way it<br/>
was talked about pretty well. It was meant to be a way for parents to<br/>
put their kids on automatic: set &#39;em and forget &#39;em. That wasn&#39;t<br/>
usually said but the phrase &quot;seen and not heard&quot; was said. And it was<br/>
intentional. There were four girls in my family of origin and both my<br/>
parents worked full-time and then came home to a huge garden and the<br/>
animals to care for on our mini-farm, church and choir duties, and so<br/>
on. They didn&#39;t have time for much involvement, certainly very little<br/>
that was one-to-one.  Spanking and thinly veiled threats of<br/>
abandonment were there to control the factors that weren&#39;t as easily<br/>
controllable. It was because we kids depended on our parents love,<br/>
involvement and approval that spanking even worked.<br/>
<br/>
It was stable alright.<br/>

put digital bookmarks all over the book with just one quick click of the <br/>

multiple bookmarks, to no avail, and finally settled for an iPod. If <br/>
anybody knows of an mp3 player that sets multiple bookmarks, I&#39;d love to <br/>
know about it. I&#39;d have thought audible.com would recommend one, but <br/>
they don&#39;t list one. I finally figured that nobody making a product <br/>

I can say that my sister spanks her kids.  Her kids are really great kids.  She <br/>
has been married to the same man for as long as I&#39;ve been married about 18 yrs. <br/>
 They have 4 kids.  I take issue with many of her parenting choices, yet their <br/>
family interactions and dynamics are mostly healthy and focused on togetherness <br/>
and getting along.<br/>
<br/>
My neighbor is a single mom who spanks her kids and has three kids from three <br/>
different abusive men.  Her kids are controlling and manipulative, who have <br/>
issues getting along and being kind.  There is a BIG difference.  It&#39;s not all <br/>
about spanking, even though spanking effects all of those kids!<br/>

six-year-olds, the children who are spanked might be less &#39;violent&#39;  than<br/>
those who aren&#39;t because they are more fearful of showing their natural<br/>
emotions and reactions, but in the same group at twenty the children who<br/>
weren&#39;t spanked may have learned over time to control their reactions<br/>
peacefully and the other children have grown up to be angry and violent; the<br/>
researchers would really need to follow up on the children a year or two<br/>
after they had left home, to see what the real effect of their upbringing<br/>
was.<br/>

violence either between spouses or between children or between adult and<br/>
child.  In unschooling trust is important and punishment is not about trust<br/>

<br/>
But that&#39;s what it looks like from the outside, not from the inside.<br/>
If people are so church-bound that their social question at the  <br/>
grocery store is &quot;Where do you go to church,&quot; they won&#39;t see it as  <br/>
anger, but as doing God&#39;s will.  It IS a problem (from the outside,  <br/>
and for those who want to separate themselves from it).<br/>
<br/>
And those people (my relatives in West Texas plunk in the middle of  <br/>
that soci0-religious Baptist gene pool) see not spanking as bad  <br/>
parenting. They see not going to church as abuse and neglect.  They  <br/>
see reading books other than the Bible, when making decisions, to be  <br/>
succumbing to satanic influences.<br/>
<br/>
That reminds me today&#39;s my dad&#39;s birthday.  He&#39;s been dead over half  <br/>
my life, but I should probably go and write something on my blog. &lt;g&gt;   <br/>
One of his cousins sent me some new photos of him. Then she sent me  <br/>
some anti-Obama bullshit and I wrote and told her to take Kirby, Holly  <br/>
and Keith of her family mailing list, that she could leave me because  <br/>
I grew up hearing that but they didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid, we were harangued by that side of the family (half  <br/>
of them Baptist preacher families, the rest deacons or masons or both)  <br/>
if we were &quot;anti-American.&quot;  &quot;Anti American&quot; was mostly questioning  <br/>
the president or U.S. wars.  Now this same batch of people are calling  <br/>
the President of the U.S. anti-American.  The belittlement of younger  <br/>
people and of different people, is to the bone with them, to the core  <br/>
to the soul. I&#39;m very glad I didn&#39;t grow up there.   I was safely in  <br/>
northern New Mexico and only visited there once a year or so.  I could  <br/>
see from the time I was little that there were nicer, smarter people  <br/>
and some of them were Catholic and lots of them were &quot;Mexicans&quot; (in  <br/>
Texas parlance; Hispanic in norther New Mexican language) and some of  <br/>
them were Pueblo Indians, and I didn&#39;t have to depend on my own  <br/>
relatives for advice or support.  I was lucky.  Some people live  <br/>
surrounded by thousands or millions of families who are still into  <br/>
&quot;Bible=spanking, non-Bible=devil&quot; mode.<br/>

But I think especially as Southern people who are pigeon wholed and steroe typed we need to educate our selves on alternatives to dealing with behaviors and just generally our anger. Or at least in my experience it&#39;s because I&#39;m at the end of my rope that I think to myself &quot;this would be easier if I was like my Mother and just pulled out a belt&quot;.  But it&#39;s not an answer to the behavior.<br/>

&gt; &gt; This is getting far afield from unschooling, but there are many cultures and subcultures where what &quot;good parenting&quot; looks like, the vast majority of the time, involves spanking. When that&#39;s the case, people who don&#39;t spank are more likely to be the uninvolved, even negligent parents. That&#39;s true in the part of the world where I live - the rural, mostly white, South. Its not a statement about the benefits of spanking, rather its a picture of results given one bad option, and one worse option.<br/>

<br/>
You might not agree, but you are the exception right?  Lots and lots of people <br/>
really do believe that spanking IS the answer to behavior.  Might makes right. <br/>
 I&#39;ve never lived in the south.  One of my friends grew up partly in the south <br/>
and partly in the NW, as an adult ended up in the south for a while and hated <br/>
it.  Her experience is that if you don&#39;t go to church, you won&#39;t find many <br/>
friends.  If you don&#39;t go to the &quot;right&quot; church people will talk behind your <br/>
back.  If you don&#39;t discipline your child the &quot;right&quot; way, you may be shunned. <br/>
 That&#39;s her experience.  She&#39;s lived in many parts of the US and this is <br/>
something that happens in the south, in a way that doesn&#39;t happen in other <br/>
places.  <br/>
<br/>
Southern hospitality, she says is superficial, it&#39;s all for show and as long as <br/>
you fit all the other criteria of social norms, people will continue to be <br/>
hospitable, otherwise not.  In that kind of environment, I can see how NOT <br/>
spanking would be really hard.  It would be easier to pull out a belt, since <br/>
that IS what is expected of parents.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday a mom spanked a little kid for not getting off the swing fast enough <br/>
for her liking.  She did it in anger and it was violent.  Margaux was very upset <br/>
by it.  I&#39;m glad it upset her, I&#39;d hate for her to see it as normal.  <br/>
<br/>
The police were at my neighbors house for a long time yesterday, the little boy <br/>
didn&#39;t think anything of it.  The police have been over there a lot.  Margaux <br/>
was afraid for him, he spent most of the day at my house to avoid all the drama <br/>
at his house.  That is his experience of life in the small time he&#39;s been alive, <br/>
that drama that sometimes involves violence is normal, that police showing up is <br/>
normal, that adults in uniforms can ask you to take off your clothing to inspect <br/>
you is normal, and he goes about his life by riding his bike and going to the <br/>
neighbor&#39;s house.  That was probably normal for his mother growing up too, so <br/>
she repeats it because it&#39;s normal.<br/>
<br/>
Those things are so far from normal for my kids that they cause fear.<br/>

<br/>
True of my children compared to my sister&#39;s children.  They didn&#39;t  <br/>
even look up one night--the three of her young children sitting on a  <br/>
couch watching cartoons, when there were three drunks all yelling at  <br/>
me in turn (&quot;just playing,&quot; they would have said; friends and  <br/>
relatives of many years, too drunk to be nice).   Kirby, though, who  <br/>
was two and didn&#39;t have any idea of such things, went out, woke my mom  <br/>
up who was sleeping in our van, and unable to articulate what might be  <br/>
up said &quot;Granny, there&#39;s a monster in there.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My mom was in her first or second year of sobriety (of nine, I think  <br/>
it was, before she decided to go back to beer as food and recreation)  <br/>
came in and asked if I wanted to go back to Albuquerque instead of  <br/>
staying over in Chamita.  I sure did.     While he was out, they told  <br/>
Kirby was &quot;a titty baby,&quot; and the only reason he was afraid was I was  <br/>
still nursing him.  And still my niece and nephews didn&#39;t look over  <br/>
into the room, though we could see each other fully through the door.<br/>
<br/>
That was heavy evidence that the drinking and yelling were normal.<br/>
<br/>
I wrote a long letter when I got home, still full of adrenaline after  <br/>
a two-hour drive in the dark, and explained my theory.  They quit  <br/>
drinking for many years after and because of that incident (or of the  <br/>
letter, or the combination).  They both started again, eventually,  <br/>
ended up divorced and their youngest kid does heroin, drinks and has  <br/>
been in a couple of car accidents, and some rehab, and some more rehab.<br/>
<br/>
Those weren&#39;t the southern Southern Baptist relatives, though one of  <br/>
the guys there that night was from a missionary family he had bailed on.<br/>
<br/>
Drama and violence are easy to stay with.  There&#39;s a kind of  <br/>
fulfilling fun and self-congratulatory air to them.  Some people  <br/>
become addicted to that energy, or it&#39;s the only way they know to  <br/>
interact.  Keeping that away from unschoolers and unschooling away  <br/>
from that is a good idea, when possible.<br/>
