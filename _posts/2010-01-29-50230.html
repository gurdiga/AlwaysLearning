<div id="ygrps-yiv-1567000274">I still can&#39;t e-mail directly and it&#39;s frustrating, but I can&#39;t spend the morning straightening that out because there&#39;s a chat soon.<br/>

I have twenty minutes to eat before that chat begins, and so if I seem non-responsive to this list for a while, it&#39;s  not that I&#39;m not involving myself in unschooling discussions.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Friday and have a good weekend, to those who see this later.  I do try to avoid &quot;timely&quot; posts on this list.   <br/>
