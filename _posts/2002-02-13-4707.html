<div id="ygrps-yiv-1731522933"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;...we do talk a lot about what we don&#39;t do.  Maybe<br/>
&gt;because sometimes its easier to discuss what <br/>
&gt;unschooling is not rather that what it is.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;How can I pass on that knowing?  I mean can I even? <br/>
&gt;Each person has to find that within themselves.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Unschooling itself is a term that is defined as what<br/>
it is not.  It is not school.  That sets the tone I<br/>
think, for what people initialy think and feel about<br/>
unschooling, both supporters and nay-sayers.  <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is a mindest that for us flows freely into<br/>
and connects with all the other aspects of our lives<br/>
in other ways.  The unschooling life leads us to other<br/>
growth and change, opening our minds to new freedoms<br/>
and challenges, striving to follow our dreams both as<br/>
a family and as individuals.  I don&#39;t really care for<br/>
the term Unscooling, but I utilize it as something<br/>
that others rqecognize and connect with, something<br/>
that conveys a message aobut us and our lives<br/>
together, something that allows us to network with<br/>
others.  I would prefer a term less couched in the<br/>
negative and associating with what we DON&#39;T believe<br/>
in.<br/>
