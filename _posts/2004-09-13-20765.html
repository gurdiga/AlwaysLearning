<div id="ygrps-yiv-739548511">Betsy- Thanks so much for asking this!  We&#39;ve been needing some new ideas<br/>

sincerely hope the author of that book is busy on his second!  Deirdre<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m interested in SciFi book recommendations for a 10 year old boy who<br/>
 </span></blockquote>really likes Harry Potter and Edward Eager and Mercedes Lackey.  He likes<br/>
the Star Trek TNG novels about when the characters went to school. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
(Starfleet Academy)  I&#39;d probably read them aloud, so difficult vocabulary<br/>
is not a problem.<br/>

&gt; He liked Ender&#39;s Game, but other than that we haven&#39;t done &quot;adult level&quot;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>sci fi books.  The only &quot;juvenille&quot; SciFi that leaps to mind is Heinlein,<br/>
and the science in those is pretty outdated.<br/>

&gt; Any ideas?  He really likes books about animals and dragons, so he might<br/>
