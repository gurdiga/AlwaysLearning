<div id="ygrps-yiv-812117737">One of my favourite things that I read from this group is the wonderful<br/>
ideas other people get to entertain their children or stretch an interest.<br/>
It is something I find difficult and it frustrates me no end.<br/>
For example.  The other night my son (11) was watching Angels and Demons<br/>
with his Dad (like De vinci code I think?) and had that lovely wide eyed<br/>
excitement on his face while watching, then blurted out &quot; I LOVE this type<br/>
of movie!&quot; I asked what about it and he said he liked the whole figuring out<br/>
the puzzle and finding treasure aspect.  I felt like that SHOULD have made<br/>
me go AHA! then he would really enjoy.... but I couldn&#39;t think of anything,<br/>
except making him a treasure hunt with clues.  It lit him up SO much to<br/>
watch that movie that I would love to create that look on his face again,<br/>
any ideas? other movies, but also other interesting things that may spark<br/>
the same sort of figuring out, or whatever it is it was sparking in his<br/>
head?<br/>
I am practicing thinking of ideas of things to do, as we don&#39;t do much and<br/>
am amazed by how blank I go, then I read your posts and wonder why I didn&#39;t<br/>
think of THAT!<br/>
Thanks so so much<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1350826866">Geocaching!!! <br/>
Its a sport/hobby that combines the love of treasure hunting, the outdoors and technology. The goal is to find hidden treasures with your Gps. Check out-  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1875103990">When my son shows an interest in a particular movie, book, character, subject, etc., I often find it helpful to look it up online.  Researching the initial interest often leads to many other related things to explore. <br/>
<br/>
For example, if you look on Amazon.com for the movie he likes, there will be a short list called &quot;People who bought this also bought that&quot;  and then a long list of &quot;You may also like...&quot;  And in the reviews, people may mention other similar movies while comparing/contrasting that one.  Also try searching for other movies by the same director or writer.  I&#39;m so grateful for Amazon!  I do make purchases there often, but the majority of the time I use it for informational purposes, then see if the movies or books are available at my library. (Or for toys, games, etc., I make a note of the ideas I found online so that I can keep an eye out for some of them when I&#39;m browsing at garage sales or thrift stores or clearance bins.)<br/>
<br/>
I also like Wikipedia for helping me find more related items or ideas or concepts.  Really, just doing a general online search for info about the specific movie your son likes is bound to lead to something else which leads to something else... :)<br/>

<br/>
-the game Clue<br/>
-there are chapter books I read as a kid where you could choose your own ending and they were mysteries<br/>
-I loved watching Murder She Wrote when I was a kid<br/>
-Agatha Christie books, or maybe they have recordings? My mom loved those<br/>
-There were a couple of attempts at Nancy Drew/Hardy Boys TV series - it could be fun to watch them.  There was a Nancy Drew in the 70s, and a high school Nancy Drew in the 90s.  And there was a new show that was just like Nancy Drew, but with a blond actress and modern and she had a different name and it was a high school series.  Can&#39;t remember the name. <br/>
- One of my friends liked to throw mystery parties.  It was a game in a box, we each had a character told us ahead of time with details and we&#39;d come to the party in costume and try to solve the mystery.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-718677039">We have some &quot;Two Minute Mysteries&quot; and &quot;Five Minute Mysteries&quot; books that my husband and I enjoy. They&#39;re a great quick activity you could fit into your daily routine. There&#39;s Sherlock Holmes too. The TV show House might be a little mature for your son, you know better than me, but it reminds me of Sherlock Holmes in that he&#39;s this amazingly brilliant but somewhat broken, addicted character. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the author of Sherlock Holmes, actually was a doctor. There are some be the CSI, solve the murder, books out there that are similar if that&#39;s not too gory for him. There are some cool true unsolved mysteries out there too. There&#39;s a cool children&#39;s book about the ghost ship the Mary Celeste is one of them.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d also recommend stuff about secret codes. I LOVE LOVE LOVED that stuff at that age. There&#39;s some history of secret codes book out, or a few, but of course you could look for shows. I wouldn&#39;t skip the history of cryptology is he&#39;s interested--it&#39;s FASCINATING! <br/>
Or even just make invisible ink together. There are kid&#39;s criminology/CSI kits too. I&#39;ve done fingerprinting stuff with much younger kids. You can fake a break-in. :) Or create mail from an imaginary secret agent, in code, or something.  <br/>

several very short mysteries based around scientific principles. I  <br/>
loved those as a kid. Each has a break before Encyclopedia reveals the  <br/>
answer so you can take a stab at it. I remember one involved a summer  <br/>
time burglary and some suspicious characters escaping across a parking  <br/>
lot in a strange zigzag route. It turns out they were barefoot, and  <br/>
walking on the white lines which were cooler.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2123891105">How about the Indiana Jones movies?<br/>
<br/>
You could also try letterboxing (similar to geocashing) - the clues can be<br/>
very clever and it is a fun way to go somewhere new. If you try it, look for<br/>
letterboxes (or geocashes for that matter) that have been recently found<br/>
(sometimes the boxes are taken by people not understanding what they are or<br/>
the terrain changes or something). Treasure hunting is much more fun when<br/>
there is actually treasure at the end. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.letterboxing.org/">http://www.letterboxing.org/</a> is a<br/>
great website that explains it all and has a nice search feature.<br/>
<br/>
Our local science museum hosted a CSI exhibit several months ago and an<br/>
Egyptian exhibit is ending this weekend. Here&#39;s a link to two online<br/>
activities from the Egyptian exhibit:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.lostegypt.org/activities.php">http://www.lostegypt.org/activities.php</a> - I wasn&#39;t able to find a link about<br/>
where it might be going next. I don&#39;t know if the CSI exhibit is still<br/>
touring.<br/>
<br/>
There are several very nice walkthroughs for the Nancy Drew games if he gets<br/>
stuck.<br/>

I did remember since I was last at my computer that at that age I loved Games magazine. It&#39;s a great sampler of cool puzzles, and if he loves one you&#39;ll know what to look for more of. <br/>

One of my favourite things that I read from this group is the wonderful<br/>
ideas other people get to entertain their children or stretch an interest.<br/>
It is something I find difficult and it frustrates me no end.<br/>
For example. The other night my son (11) was watching Angels and Demons<br/>
with his Dad (like De vinci code I think?) and had that lovely wide eyed<br/>
excitement on his face while watching, then blurted out &quot; I LOVE this type<br/>
of movie!&quot; I asked what about it and he said he liked the whole figuring out<br/>
the puzzle and finding treasure aspect. I felt like that SHOULD have made<br/>
me go AHA! then he would really enjoy.... but I couldn&#39;t think of anything,<br/>
except making him a treasure hunt with clues. It lit him up SO much to<br/>
watch that movie that I would love to create that look on his face again,<br/>
any ideas? other movies, but also other interesting things that may spark<br/>
the same sort of figuring out, or whatever it is it was sparking in his<br/>
head?<br/>
I am practicing thinking of ideas of things to do, as we don&#39;t do much and<br/>
am amazed by how blank I go, then I read your posts and wonder why I didn&#39;t<br/>
think of THAT!<br/>
Thanks so so much<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-984576952">He might like The Incredible Machine and related games - puzzle solving games involving building improbably &quot;machines&quot; to solve some dilema. <br/>
<br/>
If he likes really tough puzzle games, I totally recommend the Myst series. You can start with any game in the series - they&#39;re mostly PC games and some are relatively old but the actual puzzles are marvelous. <br/>

<br/>
One puzzle type book immediately sprung to my mind, Egyptian Jukebox by Nick Bantock. A challenging puzzle figured out through deciphering clues in pictures.  It took 2 friends and I about a week to figure it out, smarter people might not take as long!  <br/>
<br/>
It is no longer in print but Amazon has lots of used copies:<br/>
