&gt; homeschoolers <br/>
&gt; in MA are perfectly happy with existing law/case law since they are able to <br/>
&gt; do any kind of homeschooling and they consider the requirements to be <br/>
&gt; perfunctory? Aren&#39;t many MA homeschoolers concerned about increased <br/>
&gt; publicity <br/>
&gt; as the Bryant case  spreads across the country and people get involved who <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t live in MA and don&#39;t necessarily fully understand the subtleties and <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t have to live, themselves, with the repercussions of any changes in <br/>
&gt; homeschooling legalities that they might bring about there?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, yes, yes....and the truth is, some of us (like me) don&#39;t have any moral <br/>
outrage about having to do the yearly proposal.  I don&#39;t want Salem to start <br/>
worrying they should require MORE, since they&#39;ve actually always been <br/>
supportive and positive.<br/>
<br/>
And my OTHER truth: I don&#39;t think I could ever risk my son&#39;s well-being on <br/>
those grounds. <br/>
