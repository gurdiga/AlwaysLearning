<br/>
Joyce Fetteroll&#39;s responses to a new reader&#39;s complaints:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-What IS the problem, is that I don&#39;t know what to replace  <br/>
Traditional Methods with. I wanted some suggestions.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Actually people *are* giving you suggestions! They are showing you  <br/>
how the principles of mindful parenting look when put in action.<br/>
<br/>
Conventional parenting focuses on what children are doing. So you&#39;re  <br/>
expecting answers in the vein &quot;When children do x, then do y.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Mindful parenting looks for the why and then often the answer is &quot;I  <br/>
wasn&#39;t mindful enough. I needed to be there *before* it got to this  <br/>
point.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Distraction is a good thing when they&#39;re headed in a melt down  <br/>
direction.<br/>
<br/>
Being mindful so their needs can be met before they get to melt down  <br/>
is even better.<br/>
<br/>
Avoiding situations that they&#39;ve shown you that they aren&#39;t ready to  <br/>
handle yet is really really helpful to them and to you.<br/>
<br/>
Tantrums aren&#39;t ordinary. They&#39;re &quot;MY GOD WHY AREN&#39;T YOU LISTENING TO  <br/>
ME!!!!&quot; They are the breaking point.<br/>
<br/>
Though, if a child has learned with time that their more subtle  <br/>
signals are useless and tantrums get attention, then tantrums can  <br/>
become their first line of communication. And some kids are more  <br/>
easily frustrated by their inability to communicate and their  <br/>
powerlessness that tantrums are more common.<br/>
<br/>
Life *is* frustrating. Being mindful won&#39;t prevent kids from getting  <br/>
frustrated but it will be a huge step in the right direction. Seeing  <br/>
the world from kids&#39; point of view will help you understand why they  <br/>
are reacting to the world as they are. Treat your kids as though  <br/>
they&#39;re doing the best they can with the knowledge and skills and  <br/>
understanding of the world they have.And often when they&#39;re at their  <br/>
worst, what works best is a hug.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I used to give them a time out (with explanation), then talk about  <br/>
what the behavior mistake was, ask for an apology (or request that  <br/>
they give their sister one), and then a hug & forgive & forget.-=-<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re too young for you to expect that to work. Kids do need  <br/>
information but we can&#39;t depend on them understanding and then  <br/>
changing their behavior. So the answer is to prevent as much as you  <br/>
can by avoiding those situations, jumping in sooner, whisking them  <br/>
away to do something else. They won&#39;t be three forever! Their  <br/>
understanding and needs will grow and change as they get older.<br/>
<br/>
Conventional parenting is not about being present with kids. It&#39;s  <br/>
about giving kids rules as a replacement for being there. Same can go  <br/>
for information. Information shouldn&#39;t be a substitute for being  <br/>
there and being aware. We should let kids know that cars can hurt  <br/>
them, which is why we steer them clear of the street. But we  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t then depend on kids understanding. We need to be there. We  <br/>
need to be aware of our child&#39;s tendencies to run to the street when  <br/>
in that type of situation. We need to avoid as much as we can places  <br/>
where they can run into the street until they can understand.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Importance of Definitions<br/>
<br/>
So I was watering my yard with my thumb over the end of the hose,  <br/>
playing with the water, and seeing the sun reflect off various drops,  <br/>
where it came through the trees, and this topic (old as much of it  <br/>
is) flooded in. I had a new idea.<br/>
<br/>
Some people define unschooling as a relationship (or lack of one)  <br/>
with school.<br/>
<br/>
Others define it as a relationship (or potential damage to a  <br/>
relationship) with their children.<br/>
<br/>
It seems our detractors say &quot;If my kids aren&#39;t in school and I&#39;m not  <br/>
using a curriculum, I&#39;m unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that stopping there will lead to frustration and  <br/>
failure and the continuous little additions of rules and lessons and  <br/>
requirements.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s enough if one is looking toward school and wants to declare the  <br/>
kids are out AND they&#39;re not going to use a curriculum. So at that  <br/>
point in the sort (if we were writing a computer program), they&#39;ve  <br/>
passed through<br/>
School? if no, then homeschooling<br/>
Curriculum? if no, then unschooling<br/>
<br/>
But will that last years? It&#39;s the label of a moment. &quot;Now what?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a computer program. For me it&#39;s about natural human  <br/>
learning, not about not-school and not-curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
For a short while I had a column in a homeschooling newsletter/ <br/>
magazine in California. I was dumped for writing the &quot;unschooling  <br/>
choice&quot; article <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice">http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice</a> because it didn&#39;t  <br/>
match the organization&#39;s strong anti-school stance.<br/>
<br/>
So maybe the regular radicals are more often answering the deeper  <br/>
questions. Not &quot;what is unschooling?&quot; but &quot;how can it work best and  <br/>
how can it be maintained for years and lead to these transformations  <br/>
of which people write?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My husband is out making a cinderblock wall. Maybe I should be out  <br/>
helping. But knowing the definition of masonry won&#39;t get that wall  <br/>
built nor help it be solid. The more he knows, the more he can draw  <br/>
on his experience, stories of others&#39; successes and failures, ideas  <br/>
from books, and the more choices he considers and makes as he  <br/>
proceeds, the better that wall will be, and the longer it will last.<br/>
<br/>
Buying blocks and a sack of cement isn&#39;t building a wall.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re helping people with unschooling that will last and be strong.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1780253622">-=-Unfortunately, those who can not apply this same mindful respect to<br/>
fellow adults can not be taken as credible advisers in how to deal with<br/>
children. That is simply too inconsistent to be trusted.-=-<br/>
<br/>
There are hundreds of people on this list, many of whom choose not to  <br/>
post, some of whom only come to read at the yahoo site once in a  <br/>
while, but it&#39;s not a small list.<br/>
<br/>
No one is doing one-on-one counselling for money here, it&#39;s a  <br/>
discussion.  No one needs to be &quot;credible&quot; or &quot;trusted,&quot; and yet  <br/>
there are people here I have met in real life (after having  <br/>
corresponded with them online, in the AOL forum when that was the  <br/>
busiest place, on other lists and message boards).  I read their  <br/>
words, I liked their ideas, I have met them at conferences, or  <br/>
they&#39;ve been to my house or I&#39;ve been to theirs.  There are people  <br/>
here who know my kids in person.<br/>
<br/>
What counts is that my kids are happy and at peace and trustworthy  <br/>
and interesting.  I know some of the factors that helped them be that  <br/>
way, and have freely shared those ideas and experiences, and will  <br/>
continue to do so, even though occasionally some people get insulting  <br/>
and try to get me to stop.<br/>
<br/>
-=-If one is  authoritarian in one context, but preaching a message  <br/>
of mindful respect<br/>
in others, and that person can not practice what they preach, chances<br/>
are they are a control-freak who has told themselves beating up on other<br/>
adults is acceptable.-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Beating up&quot;?<br/>
The list is mine.  Anyone can create a yahoolist.  It takes just a  <br/>
few minutes.<br/>
The list has a purpose, which I maintain and defend.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s think about &quot;authoritarian.&quot;  It&#39;s a kneejerk insult word, easy  <br/>
to throw out.  Is it &quot;authoritarian&quot; for me to care about what  <br/>
happens in my house?  A dad was here once who threatened to spank his  <br/>
daughter, in my house, and I said no you won&#39;t, not in my house.   <br/>
That was authoritarian.  It was also for the benefit of the  <br/>
daughter,  nor for the dad.  Was I not &quot;mindfully respectful&quot; of the  <br/>
dad?  I was not.  I was mindfully respectful of his child and my own  <br/>
three.  I was defending and maintaining the peace of my home.<br/>
<br/>
When I suggest that a mom needs to pay more attention to what her  <br/>
kids want, and the mom starts whining about me not respecting her,  <br/>
that&#39;s a problem in the mom, and will be a problem for the child.   <br/>
But it&#39;s not a problem for MY kids, because I have for years (nearly  <br/>
21 years)   worked to find ever better ways to be with them  <br/>
peacefully and gently and openly, and have seen other families do it  <br/>
and seen their relationships be good, and have seen families come  <br/>
nearer to these practices and seen their family relations improve.   <br/>
I&#39;m confident, and have experience with others saying &quot;I thought you  <br/>
were crazy at first, but when I did those things, our family got  <br/>
better.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There are people who know my kids, and if I were hypocritical there  <br/>
would probably only be fourteen people on this list instead of 1400.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Control freak...&quot;<br/>
That&#39;s because I put a couple of irate posters on moderation, on a  <br/>
list I&#39;m responsible for keeping productive and peaceful?<br/>
<br/>
What would be the opposite of control freak, then?  I don&#39;t see it as  <br/>
freakish or controlling to make suggestions that might help moms who  <br/>
voluntarily came and asked for suggestions.  No one &quot;had to&quot; come  <br/>
here.  No court is ordering any mom to take part in any unschooling  <br/>
discussions.  No one has to &quot;attend&quot; unschooling classes to be  <br/>
certified.  It&#39;s all choice.  There are other unschooling lists.   <br/>
Lots of them.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see it as freakish or controlling for me to ask people to  <br/>
chill or to put someone on moderation for writing &quot;kiss my ass.&quot;<br/>
