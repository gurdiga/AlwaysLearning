<div id="ygrps-yiv-1010255209">Sorry,<br/>
<br/>
I sure didn&#39;t mean to offend anyone.? I am very real - started homeschooling in 1981, and was so fortunate to have John Holt as a lunch guest in my home, and I was able to attend talks he gave out here in San Diego area.? The youngest two kids attended school a bit, then?after we started being at home, no one went to school til college.? ?I haven&#39;t been active on the list as my kids are now very grown - I have 5 from nearly 21 to 37.? We did unschool and had a great little support group here.? Actually it happens that 3 of the moms that live away will be in town, so we are having a gathering at my home this weekend.? We are now women in our 50&#39;s-60&#39;s.? <br/>
<br/>
Sanda wrote a little blurb for the back cover of my book.<br/>
<br/>
Once again - sorry if my post was off-putting (and I have donated books to my local libraries already :-)? )<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Connie<br/>
