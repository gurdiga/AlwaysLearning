(Collins Cove Clothing Optional Homeschool.)  When an anti-drug, alchohol, or <br/>
smoking commercial comes on tv, we have this conversation:<br/>
<br/>
Parent: Hey, Juls?<br/>
Julian: Yeah?<br/>
Parent: Don&#39;t do drugs/Smoke/drink irresponsibly.<br/>
Julian: Yeah, okay.<br/>
<br/>
(Obviously, this is NOT all we ever do.)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s kind of a joke, but my theory is that someday someone will offer Julian <br/>
drugs or something, and he&#39;ll crack up, saying...&quot;I can&#39;t...my moms told me <br/>
not to.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sometime you can hear about our Multicultural Homeschool Vocational Program.<br/>
