<div id="ygrps-yiv-1659331346">Well, I am a John Holt fan so I disagree with the container method myself.  Learning is experiential and this is why I have chosen to homeschool.  Alexander is not a container.  He is a beautiful human being.  I think cultivating seeds and providing the opportunity for growth to happen is more attune to my philosophy.  He is not an empty box.  He came into this world with eyes wide open and ready to explore and discover.  Where he goes I follow.  He is a teacher to me.  I am a facilitator and do my best to feed his desire to learn.  <br/>
My .02, for what it is worth.<br/>

Have just been searching for a quote to sew onto a quilt I am doing about our home education year, and found the following:<br/>
 Heraclitus said - <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire&quot;. <br/>
