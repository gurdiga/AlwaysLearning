My name is Karen and I have two sons, ages 4<br/>
and 8.  I can relate to this part of your post, because over the last <br/>
couple<br/>
of weeks my 8 year old has also become quite clingy.  I was also trying <br/>
to<br/>
figure out what is different in our household lately, and the only <br/>
thing I<br/>
can come up with is that we have recently started unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=--=-<br/>
<br/>
Mary (Zenmomma) has printed out and taped to her---I don&#39;t know? Mirror <br/>
or refrigerator?---&quot;It&#39;s not the unschooling, it&#39;s the_______.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s usually something else causing the stress.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to suggest that it&#39;s just the age. Both of my sons got clingy <br/>
at eight. I figured that Cameron&#39;s clinginess was due to a new brother <br/>
(Duncan was born when Cam was eight), but Duncan did the same thing--to <br/>
the point of almost having to peel him off me! &lt;g&gt; Two friends&#39; <br/>
children also have gotten clingy at eight-ish.<br/>
<br/>
Just speculation.<br/>

&gt; ~Kelly<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Interesting!  We had a really cool discussion last night after reading <br/>
the stuff about rules versus principles.  One thing led to another and <br/>
my dd8 volunteered that lately she&#39;s just felt the need to be with me <br/>
and do things with me as a way of recharging.  This came at the time <br/>
when were discussing the differences between introvert and extrovert <br/>
because of some issues the kids have been having with fighting when <br/>
one wants to be alone but one wants to be with people.  My dd8 said it <br/>
best when she described that she needed to plug into people like we <br/>
plug a lamp into the wall for energy, whereas my son needs to plug <br/>
into silence to recharge.  :)<br/>
<br/>
So, we laughed about how funny and interesting we all are and that as <br/>
a family we&#39;ll be here to support one another and meet each other&#39;s <br/>
needs.  It&#39;s just so different from how I grew up and how I see other <br/>
families interact sometimes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1012753358">I really hate the term clingy. I think it puts a real negative take on children&#39;s behaviour. I think of it as children needing something more or extra. Maybe it&#39;s a cuddle or some close time, maybe a story or just to respite from the world for abit. They are not little for long - I think we should lap all the cuddle time up that we can get!<br/>

  My (just turned 9) year old is also clingy sometimes.  Just the age and things going on I suppose.  Both his gramma&#39;s have been critically ill - just life sometimes can be hard for a kid.<br/>
