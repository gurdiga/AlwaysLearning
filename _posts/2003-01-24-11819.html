<div id="ygrps-yiv-1883226362">My brother and future sister in law who do not &quot;believe&quot; in<br/>
homeschooling, (let alone Unschooling) went to Dalhousie University in<br/>
Halifax, Nova Scotia.  They have been so proud about how wonderful this<br/>
place is and that only the best get in that I was elated to find an<br/>
article about a boy who was unschooled and at 12 years old entered<br/>
Dalhousie to end up with a Ph.D only 8 years later and is now the<br/>
youngest professor at MIT.  Ahh is warms my heart to read about this.<br/>
Dare I be brave and send them this article?  Why bother, they would have<br/>
some comeback about this boy.<br/>

Some lame comeback maybe, but every single bit of evidence you have will <br/>
erode the strength of their objections.<br/>
