<div id="ygrps-yiv-2004838401">Lately we have been having a common type of experience, and I think <br/>
that it is a phase that will last a little while, so I&#39;d appreciate <br/>
input.<br/>
<br/>
My girls are soon to be 9 and 6, my son 3.5.  He is a delightfully <br/>
curious, into everything sort of 3.5, and is also now fully <br/>
expressing opinions about what he does and doesn&#39;t want to do.<br/>
<br/>
What we are running into more often than ever before, are situations, <br/>
usually when out, where I&#39;ve tried to accomodate his need to meander <br/>
and check things out, but the girls are getting to a point where they <br/>
are done, and either need to go to the bathroom, need to just get <br/>
home, get in the car, whatever, and they are no longer interested in <br/>
waiting around for him.  I totally understand their perspective too, <br/>
and try to make sure that we are accomodating their needs to <br/>
see/do/get also.<br/>
<br/>
We do also run into regular differences of opinion about what to do <br/>
or not do in a particular day.  Usually in this case, it is more one <br/>
daughter wanting to go and one not, and my son has no problem going, <br/>
it&#39;s when we&#39;re out and about that we run into the other issue.<br/>
<br/>
Just this past week, we experienced this.  We had a few things we did <br/>
in a neighborhood nearby, including visiting the toy store and then <br/>
getting tap shoes for my oldest daughter.  After we were pretty much <br/>
done, though, he wanted to go back again to the toy store, but the <br/>
girls were absolutely done, and needed to get to the car.  It was <br/>
challenging for a while, as he kept running back down the block from <br/>
the car to the toy store a few doors down, and the girls were not <br/>
happy about me leaving them there.<br/>
<br/>
I totally understood everyone&#39;s situation, empathasized with <br/>
everyone, and felt like I really just tried to communicate <br/>
understanding of their needs; however, in the end it just came down <br/>
to a disagreement over what each wanted to do, and most usually it is <br/>
the toddler meander-ing-ness that creates the ultimate issue.<br/>
<br/>
We do talk a lot about what we&#39;re going to do when we&#39;re out, so that <br/>
everyone has an idea of what will happen when (although, of course, <br/>
living in the moment, plans do change too).  I try to always make <br/>
sure that I have food/drink, or make sure that we stop when <br/>
necessary, so that we can keep moods and energy levels up.  I also <br/>
try to make sure that we don&#39;t have more than about two stops if <br/>
running errands, and give ourselves plenty of time if we are going <br/>
somewhere like a museum, etc.<br/>
<br/>
As I said in the beginning, I think it&#39;s a phase, and really, in the <br/>
grand scheme, my children are pretty patient with each other most of <br/>
the time, but I know that I can always do better in helping them, so <br/>
would appreciate any communication ideas, trip planning thoughts, in <br/>
the moment success stories, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1219270090">Sometimes, I have purposely done the less desirable task first and <br/>
used the fun one as the last one.  That way you can spend more time <br/>
in the toy store checking things out without the worry of any of the <br/>
kids wanting to go back.<br/>
<br/>
I would inform all the kids of the agenda of the day and how long you <br/>
think would be good for each destination, allowing more time at the <br/>
funnest and last one.<br/>
<br/>
I have had to deal with this very same issue a lot over the years <br/>
because my kids are 7 yrs apart in age and their needs are soo <br/>
totally different that it&#39;s hard to combine things.<br/>
<br/>
What we do lately, is wait for dad to be home on evenings or weekends <br/>
to do stuff, so that I can go with one child and not the other.  <br/>
During the daytime I can take the younger daughter and leave the <br/>
older one home and that seems to work good too.  I know that may not <br/>
work with your age group, but soon it can.<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, I would suggest bouncing it back to the older kids <br/>
on how to handle the problem.  They may have some good ideas on how <br/>
to accomodate the needs of everyone.  Try to keep it fun and light.<br/>
<br/>
Little kids may have a harder time in transition, so perhaps this <br/>
should be the focus for a while, finding ways of transitioning.<br/>
<br/>
For a long time now, we&#39;ve been starting at the back of toy stores <br/>
and working our way to the front and out the door.  It seems to work <br/>
pretty good.  I also like to keep distractors in my bag or purse or <br/>
pocket.  As soon as the younger child seems to be feeling the pull to <br/>
go back or stay and be upset about leaving, I pull something out of <br/>
my bag of tricks as a distractor.  I might even say that I have <br/>
something cool out in the car, if there is actually something cool <br/>
out in the car.  I try to keep hidden treasures out in the car for <br/>
those occasions.  Food is a good incentive to leave a store.  The <br/>
draw of something yummy waiting out in the car for you can be a nice <br/>
incentive too.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if any of those things will work for you, those are just <br/>
some of the things that I&#39;ve used to help a younger kid leave a place <br/>
that they want to stay in when others are ready to leave.</div>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; think would be good for each destination, allowing more time at the <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that between these two is a new option that I can try.  I <br/>
always try to make sure that we talk about where we are going and in <br/>
what order.  Usually this happens at home, and then periodically as <br/>
needed throughout our outings.  Definitely, we have done the <br/>
chorelike places first when we can, although, sometimes the kids want <br/>
to go to the toy store first, so that they can have something to play <br/>
with while we go somewhere else, so I&#39;m flexible on that.<br/>
<br/>
What I probably have an opportunity to do better is to talk to the <br/>
girls before we get started at any particular place, and to let them <br/>
know that if they can give me a little bit of warning before they <br/>
feel like they are done, that will help, because I do need the <br/>
transition time with their brother.<br/>
<br/>
The positive with that approach, is that the girls will know that I <br/>
am really recognizing their need to be done at some point and I think <br/>
that they will be willing to give me the warning, because it will <br/>
benefit them.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly enough, I just came up with a new phrase, which is <br/>
based on the old game &quot;Don&#39;t Break the Ice.&quot;  Their cousin has the <br/>
newer version, which uses marbles on a wet kleenex.  Recently I said <br/>
that I was on my last marble about something to help explain it to <br/>
them, and they really got it.  I think that they might be able to use <br/>
that phrase themselves. <br/>
<br/>
Of course, a big part of the solution is just more, earlier and <br/>
better communication.  It helps me tremendously to hear other <br/>
examples and figure out how I can work that into our experiences.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
