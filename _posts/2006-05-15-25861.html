<div id="ygrps-yiv-657184016">~Thanks Ren to you and your family for opening your home and lives to<br/>
People Magazine, and their HUGE distribution. Your representation of<br/>
unschooling was really beautiful.~<br/>
<br/>
 Aw shucks.:)<br/>
Thanks for the feedback, we all had mixed feelings about the whole<br/>
thing. It was a great learning experience!<br/>
<br/>
The funny thing about that photo, is the background isn&#39;t even our<br/>
yard! We were standing in our yard, and that&#39;s the vacant lot right<br/>
behind us (that we&#39;d love to purchase) with a big &#39;ol pile of rubble<br/>
and brush the builders left behind!!<br/>
Our yard is much prettier, with woods all around the perimeter. Ah<br/>
well.....<br/>
