<div id="ygrps-yiv-1794098306">Are there any Aussie unschoolers in this e-group?  If there are, could <br/>
you fill me in about any important info on home-/un-schooling in <br/>
Australia?  We&#39;ll be moving there in a couple years, and we plan to <br/>
still live the unschooling life.  Thanks in advance!</div>

If there are better Australian links, maybe send those to her and to  <br/>
me too, so I can keep them on my site.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to keep this list general and international--meaning NOT  <br/>
about particular jurisdictions.  Thanks.<br/>
