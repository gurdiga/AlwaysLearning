<div id="ygrps-yiv-1738024890">Our 5 year old 80 lb Siberian Huskies decided to poop upstairs once in a while for some unknown reason last summer - I contacted our trainer (gentle dog) and he said the next time one of them did it, to hold a 15 minute conference.  So the next time Nakita pooped upstairs, I caught him by the collar, and while Ed cleaned up the mess, I held his collar and talked to him, telling him how we don&#39;t do that and how disappointed I was and if he was going to be a part of the family and inside ... , etc.  Basically I just talked in a normal voice for 15 minutes.  Where a 5 second &quot;bad dog&quot; scolding had not worked - this 15 minute &quot;conference&quot; did the trick.  It was amazing to say the least.  His sister hung out close during the conference and we have not had a single other &quot;problem&quot; in the house.<br/>
