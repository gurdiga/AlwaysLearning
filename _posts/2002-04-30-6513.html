<div id="ygrps-yiv-732642000">When I opened my email this morning, Nortons found a virus. It was <br/>
able to repair the file, but I wanted everyone to know. <br/>
<br/>
This is Nortons information on this virus.<br/>
<br/>
Date: 4/30/02, Time: 9:37:20<br/>
The file C:&#92;WINDOWS&#92;TEMP&#92;NAV4083.TMP is infected with the <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:W32.Badtrans@...">W32.Badtrans@...</a> virus.<br/>
The file was repaired.<br/>
<br/>
This virus was sent to me by a user on this list. I will send that <br/>
person a personal message as well. I just wanted everyone here to <br/>
know that it happend. If you have a virus program running, make sure <br/>
it is up to date. I know in the past I have been hit hard by a virus. <br/>
I don&#39;t know what this one will do, but they are never a good thing...<br/>
<br/>
Funny thing, my girls and I were just watching on the Discovery <br/>
Channel about Allergies, it talked a lot of Virus and antibodies... <br/>
Guess Nortons is my computers antibody... :)<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if you need any more information on this one.<br/>
