<div id="ygrps-yiv-711765522">Since my son was very little I have been making bookmarks that wouldn&#39;t fall out when a toddler knocked everything on the floor.  They consist of a long string, length of hemp, embroidery thread, etc. with pretty beads or charms on each end.  The string is thin enough to wedge into the spine of the book, doing no damage but not falling out easily, and the beads are mostly for aesthetics, but also help to keep it in place.  I love making them, so we have lots around the house, in all different lengths.  There is always a book mark handy.  Many have my son&#39;s name on them or zen-like sayings, some have charms that my son likes, racecars and such.   Despite this my son, now 9, is fond of using kleenex tissues for bookmarks, so far they have always been clean ones &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
