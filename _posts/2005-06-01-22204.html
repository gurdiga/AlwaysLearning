-=-Much as I dislike school I am growing more sympathetic  to<br/>
teachers, every teacher we&#39;ve mentioned it to has without exception  said<br/>
something like &#39;great, individual attention, and you can&#39;t get anyone  more<br/>
knowing about a child&#39;s needs, abilities and capabilities than their  own<br/>
parents&#39;, they then quite often will go on about that they really would  like<br/>
to more teaching, less handling of large disruptive classes and  ticking<br/>
boxes set down by the educational authorities.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was a teacher, and I got really tired of large disruptive classes and  <br/>
having to do paperwork and follow guidelines.  It was the old days and  they <br/>
WANTED me to be creative and innovative, so that helped.   <br/>
<br/>
But I think when teachers envision how wonderful homeschooling would  be, <br/>
they still generally think it&#39;s &quot;more teaching&quot; and more individualized  <br/>
teaching.  Teaching, teaching, teaching. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
In the U.S.  it&#39;s always said that &quot;it&quot; (whatever their goals are  in that <br/>
season) would work better with smaller classes.  Unfortunately,  the tradition <br/>
has come to be maintaining large classes in the  government-funded schools.  So <br/>
when enrollment is down, they lose some  teachers rather than spread the kids <br/>
out thinner.   <br/>
 <br/>
There is a certain strata of the educational monstrosity here, I think,  that <br/>
would hate for it to work better, because they would lose their  <br/>
administrative grant-writing, money managing jobs.  LOTS of people  &quot;above&quot; teachers make <br/>
quite a bit of money.  Teachers make very little,  and their dream is <br/>
sometimes to do useful, satisfying work since they&#39;re  making so little money for it.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s a gigantic mess I usually try to avoid talking about.<br/>
 <br/>
If they changed funding methods, every homeschooler who left would  improve <br/>
the schools on the spot by freeing up time and space for the other  students.  <br/>
The cashflow &quot;loss&quot; to a school from losing a student is  artificial.  The <br/>
money that goes to schools here comes from land taxes  (and various federal tax <br/>
things, but it should never have, and yet  does).  The flow in at the first <br/>
gate doesn&#39;t change for fewer children,  but its distribution to individual <br/>
districts and schools is tied to enrollment  and attendance.  <br/>
 <br/>
Maybe someone who&#39;s politically inclined here (or some in each state,  <br/>
province, county, everywhere that it might matter) should point that out to  <br/>
financial officials and suggest they just change the way they fund  schools.  Me, I&#39;m <br/>
just passing the idea on to those with more energy, and  I&#39;m going to have <br/>
some tea and work on my webpage.  Lazy me.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
And about webpages, and England, and school:  Holly&#39;s exciting  European <br/>
vacation is halfway over today, and I have a story about a story  involving little <br/>
fish they played with in holes on Omaha Beach in  Normandy.  I expect more <br/>
photos later today, but if you&#39;ve missed the one  of her all muddy, it&#39;s there:<br/>

When I saw the mudfight in the Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream (which has SAM  <br/>
ROCKWELL, along with Kevin Klein, Rupert Evert, and some mud-covered women), I  <br/>
thought it must be movie-mud of some sort, prop mud, make-up mud.   <br/>
Chocolate-syrup-for-mud.  Nope.  It&#39;s English mud, apparently.   (And if a bunch of you <br/>
east-coast American types think it&#39;s &quot;normal mud,&quot; you  ain&#39;t seen mud in New <br/>
Mexico and west Texas, which is a bit more like wet  cement with too much sand,  <br/>
than like liquid color.  <br/>
