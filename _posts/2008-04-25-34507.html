<div id="ygrps-yiv-1278597619">I am new to the group and to unschooling.  I have a 2 1/2 year old <br/>
daughter and was wondering at what age should I &quot;expose&quot; her to <br/>
foreign languages or if that is something that should be taken on <br/>
later whenever she shows an interest??  We have recently returned to <br/>
south Florida and I plan to learn Spanish ... this time because I want <br/>
to, and not because it is some requirement to get my degree ;-)  I had <br/>
3 semesters in undergrad and barely remember anything.  Should I learn <br/>
and expose her to it while I am learning?  If so, any recommendations <br/>
on the best way to go about it?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much, <br/>

<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t it be cool if she could catch it like chicken pox?<br/>
<br/>
While you&#39;re learning it, I&#39;m guessing you&#39;ll be watching DVDs in  <br/>
Spanish and like that.  Maybe you could rent some kids&#39; shows on DVD  <br/>
with spanish so she could be having fun with the pictures and songs  <br/>
while you&#39;re learning the language!  Two for one.  Three for one.   <br/>
She can hang out with you!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1563199919">There are some tapes/CDs of popular children&#39;s songs sung both in <br/>
English and Spanish. I can&#39;t remember the name of the one I am thinking <br/>
of--I know they sell it at Borders. That sounds like the kind of thing <br/>
that both a mom and a 3 year old could enjoy, especially while out in <br/>
the car. While you are at it, you might see if she is interested in a <br/>
Spanish/English picture dictionary. If she likes to look at that kind <br/>
of thing in English, she might get a kick out of it in Spanish. You <br/>
would both learn a bunch of nouns. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-739367756">For that matter, if you get a bilingual picture dictionary, and she is <br/>
interested in the pictures, but not so much the Spanish, you would <br/>
still be seeing the Spanish while you look at it together. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-604230239">I just read your article and I agree with you. My<br/>
daughter loves to watch Dora the Explorer, and Go<br/>
Diego Go. I am excited that she learned to say some<br/>
Spanish words. We also have a bilingual book in the<br/>
livingroom and we review it together whenever she asks<br/>
me to. Her motivation has grown stronger now that her<br/>
dad mentioned that he wants to learn to speak Spanish.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1999324322">A lot of DVDs have a Spanish language track:  my daughter used to love<br/>
watching Alice in Wonderland in Spanish.  We also bought some<br/>
children&#39;s shows that were recommended by a family friend from Mexico,<br/>
but my daughter didn&#39;t like them at all.  The Spanish language track<br/>
on DVDs was much better for us.  I like it best with animation b/c it<br/>
is disconcerting not to have the lips match up... also my daughter<br/>
likes cartoons better than shows with real people.<br/>
<br/>
We have a lot of children&#39;s books in Spanish and a few in French.  I<br/>
took French, but my daughter was only interested in Spanish so that is<br/>
what we bought.  I bought a lot of translations of books that we had<br/>
in English so that she already knew the story and it was easier to<br/>
follow.  Some translations aren&#39;t very good and some are great.<br/>
Reviews on Amazon often give you a good idea of what to expect.<br/>
<br/>
We also had some CDs with spanish music.  The two I have are &quot;De<br/>
Colores&quot; and &quot;Diez Deditos&quot; by Jose Luis Orozco and they both have<br/>
books that go with them that have the lyrics and music.  Guy with a<br/>
guitar singing folk songs.  I like listening to them.  My kids do as<br/>
well, but now they prefer music in English.  We had some other CDs by<br/>
other people but they were annoying.<br/>
<br/>
She likes Dora and Diego.  She watches the show, has the talking doll<br/>
house, and we have books in English and Spanish.  She also has lots of<br/>
other Dora stuff, but those are the things that have Spanish in them.<br/>
<br/>
She is more interested in other things now, but those are the Spanish<br/>
things we have around the house.  Oh, the other thing we did is that I<br/>
took a Spanish class so that I could read to her with a decent accent.<br/>
 She was too young at the time to take a class, but she wanted more<br/>
Spanish and I thought that was a good way to do it.  I really enjoyed<br/>
the class and it made it a lot more fun to listen to the music and<br/>
watch the movies.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-712376186">Thanks so much for all the wonderful suggestions!  I am very excited <br/>
to begin learning and to have ideas for exposing Lexi.  If she is <br/>
excited about it, we can pursue even more ways to give her Spanish <br/>

Thanks again!<br/>

<br/>
I live in Weston, FL now ... it&#39;s really the western portion of Ft. <br/>
Lauderdale.  So, not too far.  I&#39;d love to get together.  I would <br/>
like to pursue additional languages once I feel I have some mastery <br/>
over Spanish.<br/>

Hope to see you soon!<br/>
