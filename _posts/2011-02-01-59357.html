<div id="ygrps-yiv-1972126469">I&#39;m behind in reading my emails, and I know I&#39;m late to the game with this thread, but I think this is worth mentioning.<br/>
<br/>
I opened the link to the Sandra&#39;s Monkey platter page, and was looking at the pictures.<br/>
Logan (4yo) was watching Toy Story on the computer sitting next to me.<br/>
He took one look at the photos and asked for a tray of cucumbers and baby oranges (clementines).<br/>
I made him a tray with what I had in the house.<br/>
He did not ask for the marshmallows ;-) but he did want an ice-cream cone afterwards.<br/>
I make him trays like this often, but I thought it was cool that the images inspired him to ask for one.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m attaching a photo.The starfruit came from a recent supermarket trip after I read the link about doing better, (I think it was something Joyce or Pam said, and it struck a chord).<br/>

If you can put it on a blog, or send it to me and I will put it somewhere and link it to the list if you don&#39;t have a way to do that, that would be fine.<br/>

There are so many people who just wouldn&#39;t believe it, and will never see it, because they are determined to be judgmental and controlling.<br/>
<br/>
The person who asked if I was from the Bay Area had only joined the list earlier today.  I returned a batch of critical e-mails, one of which said this list seems very closed minded, and asked her to read here before posting.  I didn&#39;t know when I let the first one through that it was her first day on the list. <br/>
<br/>
People who think we are closed minded and that their controlling fearfulness is somehow indicative of positive thought and open mindedness might never, ever see a little boy ask for oranges and cucumbers while looking at a photo of marshmallows and strawberries.<br/>
<br/>
For those new to these discussions, there&#39;s a story of my daughter Holly, when she was little, wanting plums.  Of all the things in all the stores, in all the world, she asked for plums.  <br/>

<br/>
You were not kicked off the list.<br/>
I asked you to read the introduction before posting again.  I suspect you didn&#39;t do so.  Please do.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/</a><br/>
<br/>
I did not control my children as you seem to be suggesting people might want to do.<br/>
<br/>
I do attempt to maintain the peace of this list, and keep it on topic.  That&#39;s why it&#39;s as old, as large and as on-topic as it is.  People are asked not to post until they&#39;ve read a while.  <br/>

<br/>
Let&#39;s discuss the ideas you presented in light of whether they lead  <br/>
anyone closer or away from unschooling.<br/>
