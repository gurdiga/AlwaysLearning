<div id="ygrps-yiv-1886493866">The &quot;tag line&quot; of the accountability association I run in SC to allow <br/>
families to homeschool is &quot;Childhood is NOT a dress rehearsal.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, I get reminded of this every now and then. Not that I <br/>
don&#39;t *need* to be reminded. It&#39;s just that I wish I weren&#39;t reminded <br/>
in such a harsh way.<br/>
<br/>
I think most traditional, conventional parents think of something <br/>
different when they hear or read it. I think they start considering <br/>
that we only have this one chance to push our children to do better, to <br/>
be better, and to strive harder for that medical degree or career <br/>
choice or...&quot;success&quot; or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not the message I get.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking about what to write now for several days to honor <br/>
the memory of Hannah Jenner, who died two years ago on February 24. I&#39;d <br/>
wanted to toss out there that we really DO only have so much time to <br/>
spend with our children---and even though we *think* have the rest of <br/>
their lives to do and be with them, there&#39;s no guarantee that they <br/>
won&#39;t be taken from us a whole lot sooner than we think. The time they <br/>
spend with us should be full of joy and fun and happy, happy thoughts. <br/>
Their time with us should be filled with *our* joy in them---that they <br/>
know that our world is a better place *because* of them.<br/>
<br/>
Hannah&#39;s short life is a tough reminder for me to enjoy the children I <br/>
have---and every single minute. And not a day goes by that I don&#39;t <br/>
think of Hannah (and Sam Wilkerson and Jacob Strebler). &#39;Cause I just <br/>
don&#39;t know what I would do without Cameron and Duncan. But sometimes, <br/>
when I&#39;m not my best and my temper is short, I *need* that little <br/>
reminder---that this time is a gift.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Too often, parents can work so hard helping our children &quot;become&quot; that <br/>
we forget to enjoy Who They *Are*--right now, this minute.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lisa Heyman&#39;s passing yesterday has stunned this community. And I just <br/>
can&#39;t imagine the pain and loss the Gauchmans are experiencing right <br/>
now. But I *know* that the girls, Roxy and Fire, will know that their <br/>
mom truly valued the time she had with them. She chose to keep the <br/>
girls close and let them grow &quot;In Their Own Way, In Their Own Time.&quot;  <br/>
That&#39;s a gift we can ALL give our children. To accept Who They <br/>
Are---and to revel in it!<br/>
<br/>
We have that choice.<br/>
<br/>
Lisa understood that childhood is not a dress rehearsal. Lisa worked <br/>
hard to give her girls he space they needed to grow. She gave them <br/>
inspired, joyful childhoods. There&#39;s not a doubt in my mind that Roxy <br/>
and Fire will thrive in spite of their huge, huge loss. And a big part <br/>
of that is the love and acceptance Lisa showered on them. They will <br/>
kept warm with her light.<br/>
<br/>
Her passing will continue to be a reminder that *my* time with my kids <br/>
is limited as well. I can choose to make the most of each moment with <br/>
them as she did. Our world is brighter because of Lisa. And I&#39;m glad I <br/>
got to know her.<br/>
<br/>
Much Love and Many Hugs to Larry and Roxy and Fire.<br/>
<br/>

That was Kelly Lovejoy in February.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this weekend Holly and I were talking about her boyfriend  <br/>
Brett.  She said some of the (very few) things she doesn&#39;t like about  <br/>
him are things he does even worse to me, but I don&#39;t seem to mind.  I  <br/>
reminded her different things bother different people.<br/>
<br/>
She asked why I like him so much, and I said because I thought they  <br/>
could have a really good life together.<br/>
<br/>
She said &quot;We have a really good life together right now.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I still forget sometimes, and I think of her life as starting when  <br/>
she leaves home.  Habits, habits, habits.  I keep working to approach  <br/>
the life-is-now awareness that my kids already have.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The rest of Kelly&#39;s post is here, in case anyone here needs reminders  <br/>
of how important it is to live for the present.<br/>
