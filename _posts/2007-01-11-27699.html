community college last fall, got A&#39;s, B&#39;s and credit for the <br/>

a life-long unschooler &lt;g&gt;).  The problem is Dad, who keeps asking *me* <br/>
what she&#39;s going to do.  I suggest he ask her.  She has no plans, no <br/>
ambition, no need or desire to leave home.  She applied for one job <br/>
last year.  She doesn&#39;t drive and has no desire to learn; if she does <br/>
get a job, it will be my job to transport her, just as it was with <br/>
college.  She doesn&#39;t see the point of racking up credits without any <br/>
goals.<br/>

closest city being a two university city. There is a small community <br/>
college, it is 45 minutes away, the state university offers dual enrollment <br/>
for ages 16-19. The state college is about 25-30 minutes away.<br/>

desire to attend college, I have always had a strong desire to learn. I have <br/>
even audited a few classes while my husband was taking them for <br/>
informational purposes. My husband waited until he was in his late 20&#39;s to <br/>
finish college. It has neither made or broken his career or mine.  And <br/>
without putting too much importance in money, we make plenty.<br/>

<br/>
It sounds like you are saying you are having trouble connecting with <br/>
your dd&#39;s desire, since its not one you share. Have there been other <br/>
times in her life when she has developped an interest that you had <br/>
difficulty understanding or connecting with? If y&#39;all have mostly <br/>
shared interests in the past, its no wonder you are reeling! <br/>
<br/>
I have been doing quite a bit of &quot;stretching&quot; since my stepson moved <br/>
in - his interests are very different from mine, whereas my 5yr old <br/>
tends to be interested in the sorts of things that are easy for me <br/>
to relate to. <br/>
<br/>
Imerse yourself in her interest, just as if she were interested in <br/>
skateboarding or painting. Ask her what she&#39;s excited about and look <br/>
for ways to support her. Help her look over the course catalog, if <br/>
she wants, and figure out which classes could fill requirements <br/>
while being more fun than the usual. Take a tour of the school with <br/>
her - they usually have some standard &quot;orientation&quot; tours for <br/>
incoming freshmen, or you can just go and sight see. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She wants to go for a social aspect <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I loved the &quot;social aspect&quot; of going to a Big university. It was a <br/>
really easy environment in which to sample a lot of different social <br/>
scenes and make friends with a pretty wide range of ages and <br/>
backgrounds. I&#39;d say I got waaaaaaaay more out of the social parts <br/>
of college than the &quot;academic&quot; parts. <br/>
