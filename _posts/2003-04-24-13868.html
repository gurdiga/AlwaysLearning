doctor appointment to go to that they were begging to stay home from, I said, <br/>
&quot;9 years old is not old enough to stay home alone.&quot; They had a quick and <br/>
witty response, &quot;But mommy, theres two of us so together we are 18 and that <br/>
is old enough to stay home alone.&quot; I did end up letting them since my <br/>
appointment was only a couple miles away and I had a cell phone and my next <br/>
door neighbor said she keep an eye out and my cousin lived 10 houses down. <br/>
When I left I gave specific instructions on not answering the phone unless it <br/>
was me, to which they replied &quot;do you become psychic when you stay home <br/>
alone?&quot; I was confused at what they could be talking about which of course <br/>
made me rethink leaving them, so I asked, &quot;What do you mean psychic?&quot; To <br/>
which they answered, &quot;How else will we know if you are the one calling?&quot; Got <br/>
me again!!! Clever thinking and then I told them to wait for the answering <br/>
machine to pick up any calls and only pick up if they heard my voice. To <br/>
that, they were thrilled and shoed me right out the door.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-679913125">Brianna wasn&#39;t that comfortable being home alone at night for that length of time.<br/>
She&#39;s okay with me being out for a little bit - an hour or so.<br/>
<br/>
She said that when she&#39;s older - like 12 or 13 - then she can stay alone at night.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s cool.<br/>
I survived not going to this concert.<br/>
And, oddly enough - the concert went on w/o me!<br/>
