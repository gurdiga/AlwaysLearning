<div id="ygrps-yiv-654920207">My teenagers (16 & 17) took my 4yo to see it last night. They said it tried very hard to be funny for everyone -- little kids, teens, adults -- and failed on all counts (they both are big Mike Myers fans).  Little ds said it LOOKED like the cat in the book, but he sure didn&#39;t ACT like him.<br/>

  As for the movie, I think the original poster was asking if it was<br/>
  appropriate for preschoolers - and I have to say that I don&#39;t think it is.<br/>
  I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything in it to scar them for life, but there&#39;s<br/>
  enough tacky stuff that I think I&#39;d just pass on it for my kid if he were<br/>
  still little.  <br/>
