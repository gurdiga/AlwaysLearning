<div id="ygrps-yiv-1053467272">I loved this as I had to learn it the hard way.  When we were getting ready<br/>
for dinner or going out I was constantly saying to Zak &quot;turn that thing off<br/>
please&quot; and he&#39;d say &quot;I&#39;m in a battle it will take a few minutes&quot;  Before I<br/>
really looked at the game I would turn it off and he started crying and<br/>
complaining that he would lose his battle and have to start again to get to<br/>
that level.  That made sense to me and so now I give him a 15 minute warning<br/>
that he needs to save his game because we are having dinner or whatever we<br/>
are moving onto that doesn&#39;t include him having the gameboy attached to him<br/>
as an appendage.  One other thing for Zak is that I notice if he doesn&#39;t<br/>
give up his gameboy at least a couple of hours prior to bed he can&#39;t sleep,<br/>
all he can think about is his game and what&#39;s next..<br/>

Its amazing how you see the world once you put respecting kids on a <br/>
higher level than maintaining &quot;control&quot; as a parent...in the same <br/>
day i read an article in some magazine about limiting videogames, <br/>
which including maintaining a &quot;half hour&quot; rule on school days and <br/>
only an hour of playing on weekend days. I thought &quot;How the heck can <br/>
the kid get anything done in a game in an hour?!&quot; Then we were <br/>
watching this new show on tv called &quot;6 Degrees&quot;, and the dad told <br/>
the son to stop playing his game, it was bedtime. The kid said &quot;A <br/>
couple more minutes, I&#39;m almost done with this level!!&quot; The dad made <br/>
him turn it off immediately, and then when the kid complained he <br/>
smashed the gameboy. My first thought was &quot;Doesnt this parent know <br/>
that there are only certain &quot;save spots&quot; in the game, and the child <br/>
will lose all his hard work if he stops now!?!&quot; Its so much better <br/>
to be on your child&#39;s side.<br/>
