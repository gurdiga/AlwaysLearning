<div id="ygrps-yiv-2141381267">I haven&#39;t counted, but I&#39;d guess that *maybe* 20<br/>
people have participated thread to which you refer,<br/>
between comments I received on-list and off-list.<br/>
There are how many people subscribed?!? I would guess<br/>
that there are plenty of people who&#39;re just<br/>
uninterested (or bored-to-drooling with my prose as<br/>
the case may be). They&#39;ve managed to not get upset by<br/>
it all. You can do the same. Here&#39;s how (***note:<br/>
practical information ahead***)<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re uninterested, don&#39;t read. If you disagree,<br/>
feel free to do so. I&#39;d actually love to hear your<br/>
perspective.<br/>
<br/>
I doubt that I&#39;m wasting your bandwidth, because we<br/>
all have that in spades now. This is not required<br/>
reading.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;d like I can send you step-by-step instructions<br/>
on setting up a specific filter so that you never have<br/>
to chance reading another word I write. Or you can hit<br/>
*delete*, both are equally effective.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and you forgot to say &quot;1 2 3 4, I declare a<br/>
flame-war&quot;. <br/>
Next time,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-805832597">I would not have let this post through to the list.  When I went to  <br/>
return it to the author, someone had already approved it.  That&#39;s  <br/>
fined.  It gives me an opportunity to point out the problems.<br/>
<br/>
The subject line, &quot;Subject: [AlwaysLearning] For Ruby/Julie&quot; is  <br/>
inappropriate.<br/>
Address comments to the group as a whole as much as you can, even  <br/>
within posts.<br/>
<br/>
Do NOT advise posters who were here before you were about how to  <br/>
block your posts.  We have kept a lot of peace on this list for   <br/>
years.  We&#39;re letting you disrupt that peace for a while because  <br/>
others benefit from the exchange.<br/>
<br/>
-=-If you&#39;re uninterested, don&#39;t read. If you disagree, feel free to  <br/>
do so. I&#39;d actually love to hear your perspective.-=-<br/>
The list isn&#39;t about what you would love to hear.  If you would love  <br/>
to read about unschooling, stick around.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Oh, and you forgot to say &quot;1 2 3 4, I declare a flame-war&quot;.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If you want to stick around, if you want there to be a  next time, do  <br/>
not attempt to post anything this immature and inflammatory again.<br/>

If there&#39;s anything about &quot;be nice&quot; or &quot;trapdoor&quot; that you don&#39;t  <br/>
understand, don&#39;t post anything else until you&#39;ve figured that out.<br/>

I meant &quot;that&#39;s fine.&quot;  Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have fines on this  list, just that trap door.<br/>
