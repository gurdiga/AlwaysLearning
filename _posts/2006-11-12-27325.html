<div id="ygrps-yiv-81837284">Once in a while an anxious feeling like that might pop<br/>
up in me, though less frequently now than when I first<br/>
started unschooling. I remind myself that it&#39;s not my<br/>
job to convince anyone else of the merits of<br/>
unschooling- people are either evolved enough to &quot;get<br/>
it&quot; or not. If someone shows a genuine interest in<br/>
learning about it I&#39;m glad to share. If someone still<br/>
believes it&#39;s the end of the world if their kids don&#39;t<br/>
get a degree, they&#39;re probably not ready to learn<br/>
about it.<br/>
The &quot;value and efficacy&quot; of college education has been<br/>
steadily declining especially since the notion took<br/>
hold  that it&#39;s a must for everyone. It was originally<br/>
meant for those strongly academically inclined only. <br/>
If you follow your bliss and it happens to lead you to<br/>
a non-academic pursuit, it&#39;s nobody&#39;s business to<br/>
judge you or unschooling on that. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My oldest daughter is about to turn 22. She feels as you do, Ken,  <br/>
like she sometimes is thought of as a poster child for unschooling.  <br/>
She sort of relishes that role, though, because she is SUCH an  <br/>
unschooling missionary, herself. I doubt she thinks about it very  <br/>
often, mostly she pursues her passions - that is where her focus in,  <br/>
not on being an unschooling representative.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you need to spend time worrying or being anxious about  <br/>
it, though. Just the thoughtfulness it takes to even ASK such a  <br/>
question is already enough to make us all proud of you! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, the best way for you to be a wonderful living  <br/>
representative of radical unschooling is for you to truly follow your  <br/>
own path and not feel the need to conform to what is expected of  <br/>
young adults - that IS what we want for our kids. People who don&#39;t  <br/>
want that - those for whom choosing a life that doesn&#39;t follow the  <br/>
conventional path isn&#39;t a glorious thing - who cares about them?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-819608806">I don&#39;t really think about us being a living representation at all.  Either people get unschooling or they do not.  We just live our lives for ourselves and are very happy.<br/>

I used to care more about whether they went to college, but I don&#39;t  <br/>
anymore.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest is 20.  He&#39;s had a job since he was 14.<br/>
The second kid has had a job since he was 15 and a fulltime job for  <br/>
nearly a year.  They&#39;re busy and happy and if they want to go to  <br/>
college, they can and we&#39;ll help.  They know that.<br/>
<br/>
They do feel like representives, but they know and I know of people  <br/>
who&#39;ve gone into debt and been miserable and dropped out of college,  <br/>
so college isn&#39;t the goal of the world here.  In those families in  <br/>
which it is, they have to deal with that (and the often-accompanying  <br/>
unhappiness) in they own ways.<br/>

&gt; I dropped out of high school when I was in 15 (end of first <br/>
 </span></blockquote>semester of 1975) in 10th grade, returned to school 1 1/2 years <br/>
later due to pressure from family, found it a total waste of my time <br/>
(and couldn&#39;t believe how much more I&#39;d been self-teaching myself!), <br/>
stayed until the 22nd of March (1977) and quit again to go to work. <br/>
That was 29 1/2 years ago when I quit the last time. Haven&#39;t <br/>
regretted it or wished I had stayed in or &quot;graduated&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Since I know this kind of learning works as I am an unschooler <br/>
(though I didn&#39;t know it way back then!), I have given my kids <br/>
mainly this same kind of freedom and I am seeing the fruits of their <br/>
self-styled educations. I have a 19 1/2 year old and one almost 18 <br/>
who are &quot;graduated&quot; from our homeschool and two more in their teens <br/>
who will be officially done with their schooling in the next 2-4 <br/>
years. It has been an awesome journey!<br/>
<br/>
I never think about representing the unschooling movement. I see it <br/>
more as representing the rights of parents to choose the path they <br/>
want for their kids. I also see it as total freedom in pursuing our <br/>
own dreams. I tend to be quite radical in my opinions about many <br/>
things, especially unschooling/education, and I also do not care if <br/>
my kids ever attend college or not. IF they want this course-I will <br/>
support their choice. IF they do not want to attend college-I will <br/>
support their choice. I think this all boils down to choice, don&#39;t <br/>
you?<br/>
