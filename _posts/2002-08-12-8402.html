<div id="ygrps-yiv-138157536">This one was interesting to me, and some of you may be<br/>
interested as well.  Although it is touted as a Pagan<br/>
scouting movement, they do stipulate right up front<br/>
that all faiths are welcome and that you can replace<br/>
your own faith based activities as applicable, without<br/>
prejudice.  Many chapters are in the process of<br/>
opening up all over the US and Canada.<br/>

The creation of a nationwide Pagan oriented scouting<br/>
program, known as &quot;SpiralScouts&quot; (TM) has been<br/>
announced by the Aquarian Tabernacle Church of the<br/>
Seattle area, to fill the void left by prejudicial<br/>
treatment of other established children&#39;s programs. It<br/>
is formally incorporated at Imbolc, 2001, and an<br/>
appropriate venture for the new millennium. <br/>
<br/>
SpiralScouts, a program for girls and boys working,<br/>
playing and learning together, has existed within the<br/>
church to benefit member&#39;s children for over a year.<br/>
Recently word about it spread on the internet and, due<br/>
to the great demand, it has been formalized into an<br/>
expanded program under the name SpiralScouts<br/>
International, Inc., a nonprofit subsidiary of the<br/>
ATC. SpiralScouts supplies leadership handbooks,<br/>
awards, merit badges and pins, embroidered shoulder<br/>
patches, and activities handbooks to make the program<br/>
work for you on a local basis. <br/>
<br/>
The program has a unique approach to scouting. Each<br/>
group is led by both a male and a female adult, to<br/>
achieve and teach that balance that is so central to<br/>
Paganism. While it is based on Pagan beliefs and<br/>
practices, it is designed to be adaptable by other non<br/>
hostile minority faiths as well, by substitution of<br/>
the faith based activities with their own. In addition<br/>
to the usual fun activities and woods lore, camping<br/>
and the customary scouting activities, the program<br/>
includes teaching about the many mythologies of the<br/>
ancient world. Uniquely, it includes a component new<br/>
to scouting - life strategies and skills for teens, to<br/>
help them learn early how to have good relationships<br/>
with their peers and adults, and interpersonal skills<br/>
that will serve them throughout their adult lives.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-207253315">Yes, Spiral Scouts was an option that Nanci and I looked into.  But, I want to warn everyone of my personal experience that resulted in me not considering Spiral Scouts as an option.  I joined their main email list and it seemed to me that nearly every topic was on Paganism and how to tailor Spiral Scouts into a Pagan theme.  Yes they say they are a Pagan oriented system and welcome other relegious beliefs.  But, to me it felt as if Paganism was being spoon fed to me on a daily basis.  This bothered me a bit and when I made a comment about it I ended up stirring up the hornets nest.  I got the impression that they welcomed other religions, but you better be ready to do things the Pagan way or leave.  So, I left.<br/>
If you do decide to consider Spiral Scouts as an option, just be forwarned that they do take their Pagan foundation seriously.  I was told that Local Chapters could be made into what you wanted.  Spiral Scouts didn&#39;t sit well with me because I am soooo anit-organized religious and Spiral Scouts seemed too much like an organized Pagan religious foundation.  I guess to me it felt like I was back in Sunday School and all activities were based around the church and christianity.<br/>
Just my 2 cents worth.<br/>
