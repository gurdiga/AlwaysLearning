<div id="ygrps-yiv-450579700">This is on Ren&#39;s blog, so I have some requests for clarification from  <br/>
Ren, but for those of you who have long let your kids eat what they  <br/>
wanted, are there any Twinkies fans among them?<br/>
<br/>
-=I read the argument that if a toddler wanted beer and twinkies for  <br/>
breakfast every morning we would be remiss as parents to honor that  <br/>
choice. Seriously? I&#39;ve NEVER met a small child that truly LIKED  <br/>
those foods for one. For two, even if those two options were always  <br/>
presented along with healthy choices, a small child will balance  <br/>
themselves out quite nicely. I&#39;ve watched it happen. Beer and  <br/>
twinkies get OLD really fast I bet. Not that any of my children every  <br/>
liked beer. The few times they tasted a sip from an adult, they spit  <br/>
it out, wrinkled their nose and said &quot;YUCK&quot;.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Ren, don&#39;t tell us where it came from  unless it&#39;s a very public  <br/>
place.  If it&#39;s a list or blog, let it be anonymous, please.<br/>
<br/>
But sheeesh!  Seriously, someone was saying parents should &quot;honor&quot;  <br/>
the (theoretical) request by a toddler of beer and Twinkies?<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve never made our kids eat anything, nor said &quot;absolutely no way&quot;  <br/>
about anything, and they  have never wanted Twinkies.  A friend of  <br/>
theirs once, for fun, talked several guys into pooling money to make  <br/>
a &quot;Twinkie Casserole.&quot;  Half of that fluffy mess stayed on our  <br/>
counter for a few days, and the leftover ingredients were there a  <br/>
while, untouched.  Half a jar of marshmallow cream.  I&#39;d never owned  <br/>
any before, my kids didn&#39;t want any, and after a year or so I threw  <br/>
it away.<br/>
<br/>
The last few things my kids have asked for from the store:  plums,  <br/>
apples, macaroni and cheese, pizza, milk and cheese.<br/>
<br/>
There are two girl scout cookies in a bowl in the fridge, open,  <br/>
untouched for days.  There were five but I ate three thin mints in  <br/>
three days, and have left the other one there.<br/>
<br/>
THAT is what happens when you let kids have food.<br/>
<br/>
Holly asked for wine with pizza a month or so ago.  She knew we had  <br/>
some wine that had come to us, homemade by a friend of Keith&#39;s  <br/>
brother in Virginia.  So Keith opened a bottle.  She tasted it and  <br/>
didn&#39;t like it.  That was that.<br/>

in the house, because if they get some they go wild and will eat <br/>
nothing else.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I remembered it last night while my girls were snacking on frozen <br/>
fruit...and ignoring all the &quot;junk&quot; in the house.<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;ve bought Twinkies once since I&#39;ve had kids.  No one liked <br/>
them much, so we haven&#39;t bought more. <br/>
<br/>
Once, just after a spinach recall my oldest dd was asking for fresh <br/>
spinach at the grocery store and I was explaining about the recall and <br/>
why I did&#39;t really think we should buy it, and thought how odd that <br/>
would sound to anyone walking past.  : )<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s ok to tell.:)<br/>
That post was actually a response to some comments at someone elses<br/>
blog. There was an ongoing discussion there, which I linked in my own<br/>
blogpost if anyone is interested. The blogger and I actually agree on<br/>
more than we disagree about, but she&#39;d posted some things about<br/>
&quot;neglectful&quot; parenting and it riled me up a bit. <br/>
<br/>
It was said that if her child wanted nothing but beer and twinkies for<br/>
breakfast she&#39;d be a bad parent to let them have it. It was also<br/>
&quot;neglectful&quot; to let your child&#39;s teeth rot, which we had an ongoing<br/>
challenge with Jalen about and I disagreed strongly with that point of<br/>
view. Anyhoo, it&#39;s all there. I talked about my &quot;neglect&quot; by letting<br/>
my child choose and by NOT strapping him down in order to fix his<br/>
teeth when I thought it was in his best interest.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t want a bunch of people to go read the post and then go read<br/>
at her blog and post a bunch of stuff. It&#39;s died, let it die. But it<br/>
does make for interesting reading. I don&#39;t want to be the cause of her<br/>
blog exploding either....she&#39;s someone I have a lot of respect for.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1854361915">The best twinkie I ever saw was one that we found when we cleaned out <br/>
my Grandma&#39;s house after she died.  That thing must have been 30 <br/>
years old and it had become petrified.  I wish I would have kept it.  <br/>
So if you do buy some, throw one in the back of a cupboard for a few <br/>
years...<br/>
<br/>
Someone gave my daughter a rice crispy treat.  She wasn&#39;t even sure <br/>
what to do with it (she was 2 then, 5 now) so she used it like a <br/>
coaster. <br/>
She loves to have sweets on hand, but lately has been getting annoyed <br/>
at how fast they disappear when she puts them out for friends.  One <br/>
friend was filling her own pockets!  ( I put them away after that)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1941393576">This is too funny!  Why would anyone want to live on Beer and <br/>
Twinkies?  <br/>
<br/>
My 10yr old dd asked for Twinkies about a year ago, because she had <br/>
eaten some somewhere else and wanted more, so I bought them and she <br/>
ate one.  The rest sat there in the box for a long time(they were not <br/>
fit to eat)until I threw them away.  She could have them anytime she <br/>
wants, but passes them by at the store all the time.  She sometimes <br/>
gets on a powdered sugar donut binge, but after a while, that slows <br/>
down on that, too.  Everyone in our family loves chocolate and we <br/>
have Ding Dongs in our pantry all the time and dd could have them any <br/>
time she wants,but she has eaten maybe one in the last year.  She <br/>
loves that EZ-Cheese on scrabbled eggs and I tried to tell her one <br/>
time that she shouldn&#39;t have it because I thought it was just like <br/>
cholesterol in a can.  She wanted eggs EVERDAY with EZ-CHEESE for a <br/>
month.  When she finally realized that I wasn&#39;t forbiding her to have <br/>
it, she slowed down on it and went back to her powdered sugar donut <br/>
binge.....hehehe!<br/>
<br/>
Beer....Wine....both have been offered to her, and she couldn&#39;t get <br/>
past the smell...that may change someday, and I am so very thankful <br/>
now that I don&#39;t have to bite my tongue while she has beer and <br/>
twinkies on a daily basis.  I might think of running from <br/>
unschooling..hehehe!   <br/>
<br/>
She just has no desire to have things or binge on things, just <br/>
because it is forbidden, because it&#39;s not forbidden.  I think this is <br/>
a great way to live!!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-847443395">my husband drinks beer and the girls were then maybe 3 and 4 and <br/>
they wanted to know what it was- we said beer but they could have a <br/>
taste- they both thought it gross though the little one thought it <br/>
smelled like bannans-<br/>
<br/>
they now are 5 and 3 and they usually choose small watermellons or <br/>
raspberries or their favorite cookie- there was once waffles and <br/>
cookies sitting side by side on the counter and they would pick up a <br/>
cookie and then put it back for a waffle- most candies and cookies <br/>
get tossed because nobody finishes them- when they want a candy bar <br/>
in the store they usually give me half because they are done. Grapes <br/>
disappear quickly on the counter so do baby carrots<br/>

<br/>
I was just cleaning out part of the freezer, to put summer treats.    <br/>
I bought some Dr Pepper and Sprite freezer pops (like flavored water  <br/>
in plastic tubes) and I wanted to put them in an easily-accessible  <br/>
place.  They&#39;ve been here two weeks and nobody&#39;s touched them, but  <br/>
still...<br/>
<br/>
When I was cleaning that little door-drawer, I threw away 1/4 of a  <br/>
candy bar someone had put up there one time and forgotten about.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid there was nothing that could have made me forget I  <br/>
had part of a candy bar, or some money.  My kids are calm and happy  <br/>
and not basing their value and freedom on a paltry sum of money or an  <br/>
ounce of candy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1059736086">Healthy eating has been an economic struggle for my family since I&#39;ve been<br/>
married.  When I was the stay at home parent we generally didn&#39;t buy sweets<br/>
- we made them instead.  Homemade cookies tasted better and weren&#39;t $4.<br/>
That way when they were all gone the day they were made I didn&#39;t feel like<br/>
any money was &quot;gone&quot;.  Now that I am working and dh is home we eat far more<br/>
sweets here than I would like.  Honestly because they are a cost-effective<br/>
snack.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
That will change in the summer, though.  I get my WIC farmer&#39;s market<br/>
coupons and we go check out fresh fruits and veggies from the local farmers<br/>
market without breaking the bank.<br/>

&quot;We have the need to be accepted and to be loved by others, but we cannot<br/>
accept and love ourselves. The more self-love we have, the less we will<br/>
experience self-abuse. Self-abuse comes from self-rejection, and<br/>
self-rejection comes from having an image of what it means to be perfect and<br/>
never measuring up to that ideal. Our image of perfection is the reason we<br/>
reject ourselves the way we are, and why we don&#39;t accept others the way they<br/>
are.&quot; <br/>

&gt; Subject: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Beer and Twinkies!?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is too funny! Why would anyone want to live on Beer and<br/>
&gt; Twinkies?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My 10yr old dd asked for Twinkies about a year ago, because she had<br/>
&gt; eaten some somewhere else and wanted more, so I bought them and she<br/>
&gt; ate one. The rest sat there in the box for a long time(they were not<br/>
&gt; fit to eat)until I threw them away. She could have them anytime she<br/>
&gt; wants, but passes them by at the store all the time. She sometimes<br/>
&gt; gets on a powdered sugar donut binge, but after a while, that slows<br/>
&gt; down on that, too. Everyone in our family loves chocolate and we<br/>
&gt; have Ding Dongs in our pantry all the time and dd could have them any<br/>
&gt; time she wants,but she has eaten maybe one in the last year. She<br/>
&gt; loves that EZ-Cheese on scrabbled eggs and I tried to tell her one<br/>
&gt; time that she shouldn&#39;t have it because I thought it was just like<br/>
&gt; cholesterol in a can. She wanted eggs EVERDAY with EZ-CHEESE for a<br/>
&gt; month. When she finally realized that I wasn&#39;t forbiding her to have<br/>
&gt; it, she slowed down on it and went back to her powdered sugar donut<br/>
&gt; binge.....hehehe!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Beer....Wine....both have been offered to her, and she couldn&#39;t get<br/>
&gt; past the smell...that may change someday, and I am so very thankful<br/>
&gt; now that I don&#39;t have to bite my tongue while she has beer and<br/>
&gt; twinkies on a daily basis. I might think of running from<br/>
&gt; unschooling..hehehe!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; She just has no desire to have things or binge on things, just<br/>
&gt; because it is forbidden, because it&#39;s not forbidden. I think this is<br/>
&gt; a great way to live!!<br/>

History of Twinkies.<br/>
I never knew they were named after shoes.<br/>
Curiouser and curiouser.<br/>
<br/>
They have had an effect on American criminal law, indirectly.   There  <br/>
is a term now, &quot;the twinkie defense,&quot; based on a real trial where  <br/>
someone said he had been eating too much sugar (and other stuff).<br/>

<br/>
This can tie in with the Chewbacca Defense, which is more likely to  <br/>
be known in Australia, if you get South Park.<br/>

&gt; twinkies get OLD really fast I bet. Not that any of my children every<br/>
&gt; liked beer. The few times they tasted a sip from an adult, they spit<br/>
&gt; it out, wrinkled their nose and said &quot;YUCK&quot;.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Both my sons have never met an alcohol they didn&#39;t like. They will flat-out<br/>
ask for beer, wine, etc. The only beverage either of them has wrinkled their<br/>
nose at was water. While shopping yesterday, Rowan (who is five) spotted a<br/>
bottle of rose sparkling, and requested it with dinner (and delightfully<br/>
enough, it went beautifully with the pasta we were having).<br/>
<br/>
We do it up, though. Rowan and Kestrel have their own glasses, and there&#39;s<br/>
always a toast or ten (the boys dig thinking up things to toast), and much<br/>
chinking of glassware and &quot;cheers!&quot; at the end.<br/>
<br/>
I like to think that we have utterly demystified alcohol for them, given<br/>
them some guidelines for social use by example, and given them exposure<br/>
enough so that they are safe, competent consumers. I think that especially<br/>
for kids like them, who do like pretty much like all alcohol right out of<br/>
the gate, that treating it like any other desirable and allowing them to<br/>
make their own choices within an environment of support is critical.<br/>

In some places the laws don&#39;t allow as much as they used to about  <br/>
parents and alcohol.<br/>
<br/>
The point above is good, though, because those families that say  <br/>
&quot;when you&#39;re grown&quot; create a desire to hurry up and get older, and an  <br/>
incentive to drink to prove &quot;being big.&quot;  Same old, same old.  Not good.<br/>
