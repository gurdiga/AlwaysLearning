&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I think this happens more on local lists because people are willing to<br/>
&gt; live and let live to have some companionship for themselves and their<br/>
&gt; kids.  You get a lot more of that mindset of &quot;unschooling is whatever<br/>
&gt; you make it to be&quot; and &quot;unschooling one&#39;s unique family&quot; and all those<br/>
&gt; other vagueries. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have this on a local list right now.  In fact, within the last week the<br/>
subject has come up again and 3 of us have pointed out that we should be<br/>
helping others learn about Unschooling, not supporting them where they<br/>
are.    Our main issue is that it&#39;s the list owner who picks apart<br/>
Unschooler&#39;s responses because she has resentment from someone being &quot;mean&quot;<br/>
to her on a list in the past (she is never specific about who or what list)<br/>
and she wants her list to have more hand holding.    It&#39;s hard to stick<br/>
around and constantly defend Unschooling on an Unschooling list.  However,<br/>
because it is advertised as an Unschooling list for the entire state, there<br/>
are a couple of us who feel we should stick it out and at least try and help<br/>
keep it geared towards Unschooling.<br/>

happened on our local list, it was almost the exact same kind of thing. <br/>
Someone started a new list.  I joined that one and stopped visiting the<br/>
other.  Ultimately what it did, was seperate out who I wanted to invest<br/>
my friendship energy with and I found some really amazing people because<br/>
of that.  I could have continued on the other list and accepted outings<br/>
with some of those other folks and tolerated all the food control and<br/>
such, but I&#39;m getting older and my kids are getting older and I want<br/>
people right here and now that I connect with and can talk to about<br/>
unschooling and know that we are mostly on the same page.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t mean that I have no tolerance for people new to unschooling<br/>
and trying to understand it, it only means that I don&#39;t want to get into<br/>
discourse with local people who aren&#39;t getting it and are very stubborn<br/>
and borderline rude about their personal stance on unschooling.  I&#39;d<br/>
much rather hang out with people who are actively searching for more<br/>
understanding, which is what I do, or people who have no pretense of<br/>
understanding something that they don&#39;t, like some of my older friends<br/>
who have kids in school, yet I love them just the way they are.  I can<br/>
totally deal with &quot;live and let live&quot;.  I can&#39;t deal with some of the<br/>
weirdness that happens on local unschooling lists.  I&#39;ll just leave it<br/>
at that, weirdness, because I don&#39;t know what else to call it.<br/>
<br/>
If someone who knew next to nothing about art, went to an art opening<br/>
and started critiquing all the art with the goal of doing a write up for<br/>
the local newspaper, it would be annoying and apparent to anyone who<br/>
knew anything about art, that the person didn&#39;t know what they were<br/>
talking about.  That&#39;s a little analogy about some people on local<br/>
unschooling lists, only the people aren&#39;t critiquing  art and writing<br/>
about it, they are &quot;educating&quot; children and writing about it.</div>

fairly new list, but, I think it&#39;s doing OK.    I understand about<br/>
wanting that connection.  Even on the local lists, there aren&#39;t many people<br/>
in my particular area.   I feel like I don&#39;t have the time or energy at the<br/>
moment, but at some point in the future I&#39;d like to plan local Unschooling<br/>
get togethers and maybe some others would come out of the woodwork.  I&#39;m<br/>
guessing just because they don&#39;t post, doesn&#39;t mean they aren&#39;t there, kwim?<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m on two local unschooling lists; on one (the one I started after  <br/>
the 2003 Live and Learn conference, excited and zealous about finding  <br/>
other unschoolers) I&#39;m the only one who speaks to unschooling  <br/>
principles that we talk about here.  And the outcome has been that  <br/>
quite a few people don&#39;t like me or are afraid of me or gravitate  <br/>
toward the people that hold their hands.<br/>
<br/>
The other list was started by a woman on the above list who didn&#39;t  <br/>
get unschooling, but wanted a group in her area.  That list grew  <br/>
relative large in number because it was closer to a metropolitan  <br/>
area, and I think possible because it&#39;s near a city known for it&#39;s  <br/>
progressive and non-mainstream ways.  Like Jenny wrote earlier,  <br/>
there&#39;s just weirdness on the list.  But there are a couple others on  <br/>
the list who are willing to speak up the principles of unschooling  <br/>
(not surprising, they also write and read here).<br/>
<br/>
When these lists started, I think people wanted the meaty discussion  <br/>
that goes on on international lists and real life unschoolers to play  <br/>
with.  I certainly had the misguided idea that I&#39;d find families  <br/>
instantly that unschooled like the experienced and prolific writers  <br/>
on the discussion lists.<br/>
<br/>
Knowing what I know now, I encourage people to discuss at the  <br/>
international lists, and give links to Sandra&#39;s and Joyce&#39;s sites.   <br/>
I&#39;m working to combine our local lists and nudge them toward get  <br/>
togethers.<br/>
<br/>
I remember Joyce saying that local lists would be better for get  <br/>
togethers and the international lists are better for discussion,  <br/>
because it&#39;s easy for people to get offended in discussions and maybe  <br/>
more hurtful if you know them in real life, and you get many more  <br/>
voices and experience on international discussion lists.<br/>
<br/>
When we were talking about where people are getting misconceptions of  <br/>
unschooling on this list a while ago, I went back and read through  <br/>
what I wrote on our local lists to see if I was adding to that  <br/>
problem.  In the early days my writing was more a parroting of what I  <br/>
read on international lists.  (I&#39;m rather ashamed of that, but I was  <br/>
glad to read that I wasn&#39;t spreading misconceptions.)  Although I  <br/>
fear a bit that people might think unschoolers are hard or mean,  <br/>
because I&#39;ve been willing to say some things people might not want to  <br/>
hear, and not give hand holding support &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/">http://sandradodd.com/</a> <br/>

unschooling to work for their children. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s that.<br/>
<br/>
And then there&#39;s something else:  replace the last two words in the above<br/>
quote with &quot;them&quot; and all other instance of the words&quot;their children&quot; or<br/>
&quot;children&quot; with &quot;the other parent,&quot; and you get another reason people find<br/>
unschooling difficult and unworkable.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s takes a lot of reassurance just for their own selves --by doing<br/>
unschooling-- before people can see a friendly face in unschooling within<br/>
their own families.  It&#39;s not as easy for some as for others and I think<br/>
it&#39;s rarely automatic, although it can get easier and easier and then<br/>
actually just easy for many people.  (If it was too hard, I wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
been able to implement unschooling in my family, but I&#39;m one of those that<br/>
it took years to accomplish.  It&#39;s not just easy yet for us but it&#39;s<br/>
definitely at the &quot;easier and easier&quot; stage now.)<br/>
<br/>
For lotsa people, it takes years, not a few weeks or months to get used to.<br/>
People think they&#39;re in for an &quot;oil change&quot; so to speak and for some it&#39;s an<br/>
&quot;overhaul.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Links are a great way to increase familiarity and decrease discomfort about<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Since so many people don&#39;t feel it&#39;s moral or useful or interesting to read<br/>
the bigger lists enough to support their unschooling choice with reassurance<br/>
about how it works, links in a local list might be the only things they&#39;ll<br/>
take a few moments to click and read.<br/>

I thought it was &quot;silly&quot; for local lists folks to not discuss unschooling<br/>
more but I understand better now.  Some things really are better with<br/>
distance and lots and lots of people from all over the globe, talking about<br/>
their unschooling experience.  It&#39;s harder to gainsay that many people.  And<br/>
the difference between ourselves and our nearer neighbors may not be as<br/>
great as we first think.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s just somebody saying something unusual at a group meetup or<br/>
playdate, that&#39;s one thing.  But if it&#39;s said many times over on an<br/>
international list, that could give more reason to consider what&#39;s being<br/>
said.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Unless the person really doesn&#39;t want to consider the fact that they<br/>
just might be wrong about something!  Sometimes it&#39;s like being the big<br/>
fish in the small pond vs. being the small fish in the big pond.  Some<br/>
people, and this is what I&#39;ve seen on some local lists, want to be a big<br/>
fish, and are very vocal about their ideas.  However, they don&#39;t bring<br/>
those ideas to the big pond because they don&#39;t want those ideas<br/>
criticized or shot down.<br/>
<br/>
They hide under the umbrella of &quot;this is working for my unique family<br/>
and how dare you say you know better than I what is good for my unique<br/>
family.&quot; or the &quot;unschooling spectrum&quot;, which is just another way of<br/>
sticking to ones&#39; comfort zone by not having to change their thinking<br/>
about unschooling, or the possibility that they could be wrong about<br/>
something they were so vocally upholding.  To me, that is arrogance,<br/>
plain and simple.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling message boards have been very humbling for me, when I&#39;ve<br/>
caught myself being wrong about a long held assumption or belief.  I<br/>
really only write up ideas if I &quot;know&quot; I&#39;m thinking about it clearly,<br/>
and if I&#39;m not, then it&#39;s nice to have others say something to let me<br/>
know where I may be stumbling.  Like in the thread about<br/>
intellectualism, if you can&#39;t say what you are doing and believing in<br/>
clear words, then you don&#39;t know it well enough.  I don&#39;t reply to every<br/>
subject line because some things, I feel, I don&#39;t know well enough to<br/>
give a helpful response.  I let other people do that and read and learn<br/>
from those responses.<br/>
<br/>
Local lists aren&#39;t like that though.  There are so few people that<br/>
really get unschooling nationally and internationally, and even fewer in<br/>
ones&#39; own community.  I&#39;ve been fortunate enough to meet a few in my own<br/>
community, largely by speaking my mind on local lists and having people<br/>
write to me on the side.  I figured those were the folks to invest my<br/>
friendship energy on!  Some of them joined this list because of local<br/>
list chaos and unschooling confusion!</div>

Or &quot;Have you noticed your backseat passengers are crying and begging  <br/>
