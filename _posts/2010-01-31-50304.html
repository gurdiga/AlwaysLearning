<div id="ygrps-yiv-781328806">This is from a post somewhere by a childless friend who lost like 150  <br/>
pounds (130 or 180, I don&#39;t know which or what exactly; sorry) and who  <br/>
has lately gained a little back, so she&#39;s solid onto getting it back  <br/>
off.<br/>
<br/>
This is not about unschooling.  This is about the way things are  <br/>
valued and condemned by people making judgments about foods.  I&#39;m not  <br/>
guaranteeing anything about this except that someone with a LOT of  <br/>
experience in counselling others on weight and diet posted it.<br/>
<br/>
===================================<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Eating fruit is fine. Drinking juice is not.&quot;<br/>
Saw this article today, thought I&#39;d post it because, well, because it  <br/>
supports one of my personal dieting mantras*. &quot;No fruit juice!&quot; is  <br/>
something I&#39;m militant about. To my mind drinking fruit juice is  <br/>
exactly the same as drinking regular soda - a giant calorie bomb of  <br/>
sugar with no feeling of fullness. The process of making juice is the  <br/>
process of extracting the beneficial part of the fruit - the fiber -  <br/>
and leaving the part that&#39;s there to make humans want to consume it -  <br/>
the sugar. There&#39;s nothing magical or special about fructose that  <br/>
makes it healthier than the sugar used in soda. Sugar is sugar, it all  <br/>
exists to carry calories into your body.<br/>
<br/>
If you are dieting and thinking that having fruit juice is your  <br/>
healthy option, you are shooting yourself in the foot. Ounce for  <br/>
ounce, soda has fewer calories, and neither one is providing any  <br/>
significant health benefits. You might as well have a Coke and a  <br/>
smile, because (from the article), &quot;The upside of juice consumption is  <br/>
so infinitesimal compared to the downside that we shouldn&#39;t even be  <br/>
having this discussion,&quot; said Dr. Robert Lustig, a pediatric  <br/>
endocrinologist at UC San Francisco.<br/>
<br/>
* Nobody said I had to be impartial!<br/>

That video is an hour and a half long.  Too long to ask people to  <br/>
invest in.  Can you summarize a part, or tell how (if) it will help  <br/>
unschoolers?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-834007887">I have to say I am skeptical of the advice that you can only lose weight on<br/>
certain diets, because that has not been my personal experience.  Whenever I<br/>
have lost weight its been because I was happy, played with my kids and had a<br/>
project of some sort.  I have lost weight while consuming food slathered in<br/>
whipped cream, drank juice, eaten fruit smoothies made by my kids, but have<br/>
manage to gain weight on supposedly low cal. healthy diets.  The body needs<br/>
to burn the calories it takes in, so you can cut the calories down but if<br/>
you aren&#39;t active you will still gain weight.  The human body is an amazing<br/>
thing, and will actually start storing fat if an abrupt famine happens.<br/>
<br/>
I met a very thin family from Switzerland, who have since returned home,<br/>
 who used heavy cream, full fat yogurt and consumed chocolate in some form<br/>
at every meal.  They came to Canada from the U.S. and the mother confided<br/>
she gained weight in the U.S., though in Tennessee where they were living<br/>
everyone was fat conscous and calorie conscious; so low fat food was served<br/>
everywhere, and she had to special order full fat yogurt from the local<br/>
store.  She lost the weight when they moved to Canada, when the family went<br/>
back to their &quot;regular&quot; higher fat diet. From what I understand getting<br/>
enough sleep, being active, being happy and enjoying your family are all<br/>
good ways to lose weight!  In the U.S. the mother noticed they were less<br/>
active and drove their car more, though they consumed fewer calories in the<br/>
U.S. than in Canada but they slept less and drove more in the U.S.<br/>
<br/>
The monkey platter is a great way to health imo Sandra(little bits of<br/>
everything)!<br/>

I think so too, but was surprised when I did the photo-call (photo  <br/>
contest last year) at how many people&#39;s monkey platters had sweets.  <br/>
Ours had nearly never had any. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You mentioned sleep, and weight.  I was sent a link to an article  <br/>
that&#39;s an excerpt from a new book, and will probably just start  <br/>
another thread for it in a while.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-27328024">Our platters tend to have lots of colour(blueberries, green grapes, purple<br/>
carrots, bananas, celery, cherry tomatoes).  We have also had warm<br/>
chestnuts, cashews roasted with butter and salt in the oven, and assorted<br/>
seeds.  I have put cut up veggies and corn chips with dips on platters.  My<br/>
kids love ice cream and pop right now, so that doesn&#39;t make it to a platter,<br/>
because it would melt;)  But I guess I never noticed there weren&#39;t sweets<br/>
going on there, until you mentioned it.  With sweets I don&#39;t refuse to<br/>
provide them when asked, but I don&#39;t consciously think about including them<br/>
unless asked.  It might be just me, because when hear the I think of the<br/>
word food, I visualize a stack of pancakes swimming in maple syrup or a<br/>
sandwich, rather than a chocolate bar. We have put home made muffins on<br/>
platters and banana bread spread with butter, but I don&#39;t think of them as<br/>
sweets.   Fruit dipped in peanut butter and cheese cubes and meat/tuna<br/>
sandwiches cut with cookie cutters into hearts are popular.  The peanut<br/>
butter I buy and we love is just ground peanuts(Maranantha, I think, though<br/>
I am nowhere near the kitchen).  I have tried others but this is our fav.<br/>
