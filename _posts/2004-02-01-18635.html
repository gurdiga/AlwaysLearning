My 5yo found out that Monday is Ground Hog Day, and<br/>
wants to know how we are going to celebrate it.<br/>
*****************<br/>
Today at church one kid (schooled) asked me if there would be school <br/>
tomorrow, as it was Groundhog Day. I told her that I thought that Ground Hog Day was <br/>
an excellent reason to close school, but unfortunately it was unlikely. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-57505">you could make pancakes :) I researched this a bit and found that in <br/>
France, people eat pancakes on Imbolc. The pancake symbolizes the <br/>
full moon :)  and they are quite yummy. Of course, Europeans have a <br/>
different concept of what makes a pancake but you could make them <br/>
however you like and call it a celebration!</div>
