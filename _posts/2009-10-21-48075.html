<div id="ygrps-yiv-1997069689">This takes some intro.  It&#39;s from Hema Bharadwaj&#39;s blog:<br/>

<br/>
Hema and her husband Ravi (the &quot;Nana&quot; of the story) live in India.   <br/>
They have a three year old daughter named Zoya, and a son who&#39;s six,  <br/>
and that&#39;s Raghu who did the charming thing about which she&#39;s  <br/>
written.  &quot;DS&quot; isn&#39;t a son, here, it&#39;s a Gameboy.  The packing has to  <br/>
do with a trip they&#39;re taking to England, and then New Jersey to visit  <br/>
relatives, and then to New Mexico to see me!  That&#39;s the origin and  <br/>
purpose of The Monkey Platter Festival.  They couldn&#39;t come during a  <br/>
planned conference anywhere, and would&#39;ve liked to have, so I&#39;m making  <br/>
a little local/regional conference-ish thing up in their honor.    <br/>
(I&#39;ll put a link below, but here&#39;s the post.)<br/>
<br/>
---------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
In the midst of a crazy evening... while caring for Zoya&#39;s ear- <br/>
infection, packing, making lists and getting the kids dinner.... I  <br/>
decided to make myself a chopped tomato, ground pepper and feta cheese  <br/>
salad and pour myself a glass of red wine. I needed to sit and chill.  <br/>
So i did.<br/>
<br/>
A while later when Z was napping (its night but she is in nap mode)  <br/>
Ravi came home from work looking tired. Raghu who until this point had  <br/>
been playing his DS for several hours jumped up and said he was making  <br/>
a surprise for Nana (Ravi). So Ravi went and changed and came back  <br/>
down and closed his eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Raghu, with no help from me, had chopped a tomato, ground some pepper  <br/>
over the pieces and had crumbled feta into the mix. He then found the  <br/>
wine and poured Ravi a glass. He asked me to re-cork it. Ravi was,  <br/>
needless to say, thrilled and enjoyed the snack. He wanted me to write  <br/>
about it on the blog. So here it is.<br/>
<br/>
My rough evening became smooth and I could see beyond the chaos. And I  <br/>
think Ravi felt less tired instantly :-)<br/>
<br/>
---------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking forward to having them as guests.  They&#39;ll get the room  <br/>
Kirby used to have, which Holly then had for a while.  I was going to  <br/>
give them two rooms, but Holly decided to come back for this too!<br/>
