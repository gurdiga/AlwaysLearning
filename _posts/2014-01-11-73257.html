<div id="ygrps-yiv-1539559163">Hello! I have a question about spelling. My son, 7, just started to do some independent writing. He asks me when things are spelled right or wrong. Sometimes he gets upset if I tell him the correct way. From the beginning we have always said, of writing, if you know what it says or you can tell the person you&#39;re writing to what it says then it has done its job. But now that he&#39;s such a fluent reader he can TELL it&#39;s wrong, he just can&#39;t get to how it&#39;s right on his own and I&#39;m not sure what I can do differently besides calmly spelling it for him or pointing out &quot;tricks&quot; to remember. Any suggestions on how to handle this more gently?<br/>

Sometimes he just needs one letter like the y in cycle.  If I spelled the whole word for him he would be a bit impatient and irritated with me, so I have learned to say &quot;Cycle has a y instead of an i&quot;, and hope that answered his question.  He likes clues.  He doesn&#39;t like when I do it for him.<br/>

Another thing I do (I&#39;m not a good speller), and I&#39;ve noticed Ethan doing too, is input a word in the search bar of google and let it find the correct spelling for me.  Sometimes with spellcheck in certain programs Ethan will keep iterating on a word until it is no longer underlined for being spelled incorrectly.<br/>

I don&#39;t know what instruction he received in the two years he was in school but practically no attention was given to spelling after he was removed at the age of seven. I&#39;ve never thought to ask him, and he&#39;s not here right now, but since he has consistently preferred playing videogames or watching TV to reading books, I suspect his learning method is visual in a similar if not the same way as described in the above article.</p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">Two things I remember from time with both of my children when they were small. I always used the term &quot;standard spelling&quot; rather than &quot;correct spelling&quot; because in my view there&#39;s really no such thing as correct spelling, there&#39;s only spelling that a majority of members of a society agree on - even when the spellings make no sense, which is often the case in English (I wonder if it&#39;s because of the number of words in the English language that originated in other languages - Latin, Danish, French, for example - and the pronunciation changed over time while the spelling didn&#39;t). Secondly, I never commented on &quot;creative spelling&quot;. I regarded it as part of the process of arriving at standard spelling, the way the word was spelled right now, that&#39;s all. Standard spelling is useful in most adult situations, however daft some of it appears, but I agree totally with your observation that, regardless of spelling, if a piece of writing communicates the message the writer intends it to communicate, it has done its job.</p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">Bob</p><div class="ygrps-yiv-1734501523ygroups-quoted"><br></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1734501523ygroups-quoted"><br><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> ---In AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com, &lt;melissa.cossey@...&gt; wrote:<br><br><div id="ygrps-yiv-1734501523ygrps-yiv-1584340150">Hello!

<div id="ygrps-yiv-526479473">And &quot;standard&quot; English isn&#39;t the same in different English-speaking countries.  That&#39;s only becoming more confusing, too, internationally.  For a long time, foreigners learned British-style grammar and spelling.  But in more recent decades, Americans and Canadians are hired to teach ESL (English as a second language).  Canadian spelling isn&#39;t just the same in a (very) few instances, but the vocabulary and accent are way similar.<br/>
<br/>
My husband kept learning to spell for years after he was grown.  There was frustration and pressure in school, and he was the mathy/musician/jock dyslexic type.  Things were easy for him when they didn&#39;t involve spelling or punctuation.  But once the grading and comparisons were gone and he was &quot;in the real world,&quot; he wrote things he wanted to write, for real reasons, for real people, and then he was able and willing to ask for help.<br/>
<br/>
Too often, school forbids, prevents and punishes getting help.  Reminding our kids that in the real world it&#39;s okay to ask someone, or to look things up, can take off lots of pressure.<br/>

At my current job, the office manager will ask people to proofread his outgoing emails to make sure they make sense, and it&#39;s not uncommon for someone to say &quot;I&#39;m not good at this - can you show me how you do it?&quot; or &quot;okay, I&#39;ve made a mistake, how do I fix it?&quot; In real life, that kind of information sharing isn&#39;t cheating, it&#39;s part of being a professional.&nbsp;</span></p></div>
