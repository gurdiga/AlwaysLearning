<div id="ygrps-yiv-761278881"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Marty, when he was six and seven, would shoot straight up like a <br/>
&gt;&gt;prairie-dog lookout and yell &quot;SCHOOL KIDS!&quot; and start gathering up our <br/>
&gt;&gt;play equipment like we had to be OUT of there before the last of them <br/>
&gt;&gt;touched the grass.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Casey yells &quot;SCHOOL BUS&quot; whenver we see one (or 20 ) parked somewhere we <br/>
intended to go. Depending on how many are there, we are just as likely to <br/>
change our plans.<br/>

Life is good.<br/>
