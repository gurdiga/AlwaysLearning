<div id="ygrps-yiv-116771426">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
My toddler&#39;s favorite book is &quot;Oliver Finds His Way,&quot; a very sweet book about a little bear who gets lost in the woods chasing a leaf and then figures out how to get home.  <br/>
<br/>
So, I googled it yesterday to see if I could print out some photos of the book for him to play around with or to put on the wall and came across this:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
And after having been immersing myself in unschooling discussions for awhile now, it just looked like something from another planet. All I could think was, &quot;How about just enjoying the book?!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;OBJECTIVE<br/>
Students will &quot;use correctly words and phrases that indicate location and direction, such as up, down, near, far, left, right, straight, back, behind, and in front of.&quot; --Massachusetts History and Social Science Curriculum Framework&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I mean, seriously?  How many kids don&#39;t know &quot;up&quot; until there&#39;s a lesson about it from a framework?  Don&#39;t you pretty much learn directions like &quot;over&quot; and &quot;through&quot; from living on earth among humans?  Why do you need to make a map or bring an overhead projector into it?<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;ve seen this in myself, wondering how I can prove my kids know something if we have no work &quot;to show for it.&quot;  And that&#39;s why I keep reading here, so I can continue to feel more and more that lesson plans like this one are not only unnecessary, but insane.<br/>

<br/>
OH!  <br/>
I was just trying to think of how to introduce something over here.  It&#39;s about a bear (partly) and getting lost in the woods (a little girl, kind of) and parenting.<br/>
<br/>
The only tie-in with &quot;work product&quot; is that the URL for the page has &quot;teacher&quot; in it (for no really good reason).<br/>
<br/>
The part of the story that starts there is enough to get the point I was hoping to share.  It&#39;s very much like what one might decide about the very last cookie--what is the value of one cookie?    It&#39;s from a Russian folktale, and will require reading this link and the exciting conclusion at &quot;next page&quot;:<br/>
