just lately changed. &nbsp;There&#39;s a three-phase deal up to full license. &nbsp;Anyone
who doesn&#39;t want to take driver&#39;s ed has to wait until they&#39;re 18 (I think;
I could be wrong) to take a test. </font></font></blockquote>
Same here. &nbsp;Or something like that.<br>
  <br>
I personally think it&#39;s age discrimination.<br>
  <br>
In Arkansas, kids can get a learner&#39;s permit at 14 (driving with a licensed
driver only). &nbsp;I thought that was an excellent way for a kid to get 2 whole
years of driving experience before they&#39;re left to their own devices. &nbsp;Both
my big boys got their licenses in the same week--one at 16 and one at 14.
&nbsp;The 16 yo had less experience with driving, yet could drive alone (he should
have gotten his permit at 14 like his brother). &nbsp;The 14 yo had 2 years to
practice. &nbsp;I think I discovered there *are* some developmental (physical)
issues with driving between 14 and 16...but perhaps it was just the difference
between my particular kids. <br>
  <br>
Anyway, I&#39;m glad they&#39;re both driving well and I don&#39;t have to worry about
them (much) and I don&#39;t even mind riding with them anymore. &nbsp;Don&#39;t ask about
what turned out to be a mistakes with buying cars for their use. &nbsp;I&#39;m still
suffering those consequences 3 years later. &nbsp;:P<br>
