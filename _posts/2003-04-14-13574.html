<div id="ygrps-yiv-1061681228"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Sandra, I&#39;m not medically inclined or anything, but I think it would<br/>
&gt; take great courage for ANYONE to cut into a loved one.  I&#39;ve even heard<br/>
&gt; of doctors who couldn&#39;t stomach it if it was someone they loved.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that&#39;s why doctors *don&#39;t* have family as patients.  I can look at a<br/>
lot blood and gore on strangers but not family.  When my first baby had<br/>
heart surgery, I could look at the other patients in the ICU, with their<br/>
huge scars and tubes and all, no problem.  I could only handle about 5<br/>
minutes with my babe before starting to feel like I was going to pass out.<br/>
<br/>
Another time I cut my finger badly.  I could see the bone.  All the way to<br/>
the hospital and until they froze it, I couldn&#39;t look without feeling like I<br/>
was going to pass out.  Once it was frozen, no problem.  It was like it was<br/>
someone else&#39;s finger.  I watched them stitching up the tendon and then the<br/>
skin.  Dh couldn&#39;t look at it at all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-804118020">I have an acquaintance whose husband is a general practitioner.  Their baby #2 was born in the car (not intentionally).  For #3, they decided a home birth would be much nicer than a car birth.  He brought home his cesarean kit, just in case.  Didn&#39;t need it though.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We give the boys their shots and take care of minor things but I do have two <br/>
funny stories.<br/>
When I was pregnant with Dallen (oldest) I had some spotting about mid way <br/>
through the pregnancy and Jackson almost passed out.  Even though it was not <br/>
a big deal nor was it any real amount of blood.  LOL.  And when I had Phillip <br/>
(youngest) he (meaning Phillip) had to be bagged for a minute or so, we <br/>
always called it a jump start in the nursery, Jackson almost passed out <br/>
again.  The midwife took my big fluffy pillow and gave it to Jackson and set <br/>
him in the chair.  I said what about me I had the baby not him.  LOL.  It is <br/>
amazing what you can&#39;t handle when it is your own.<br/>
<br/>
Oh yea, for those of you that don&#39;t know Jackson is a family physician.<br/>
