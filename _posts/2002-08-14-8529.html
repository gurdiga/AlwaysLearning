<div id="ygrps-yiv-273979957"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&quot;  I laughed till I cried, then showed it to the family, and they <br/>
&gt; loved it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This comment got me to try it. I had just opened the picture when my <br/>
oldest son walked up and asked what I was doing, I had just told him <br/>
the &quot;ghost story&quot; and you-know-what happened.<br/>
He jumped about ten feet and grabbed me around the neck. &#39;course I <br/>
hardly noticed, having had a heart attack and all.<br/>
