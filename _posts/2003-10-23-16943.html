problem many times with her boy. How many times can he do it and it<br/>
is still okay? At what point is he not respecting her? How many<br/>
times is too many?<br/>
<br/>
=-=-I really would like to hear what people think about that...in a non-<br/>
flaming way.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;s having the same problem many times, the approach is not working and <br/>
a new approach is needed.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s a new problem, she needs to find an approach that will work.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The first time wasn&#39;t okay.<br/>
How many times can a bad solution be a good answer?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve done a lot of thinking about respect over the years, not just in a <br/>
parent/child situation.   Here&#39;s an already-published piece specifically about <br/>
raising respectful children:<br/>

<br/>
The phrase &quot;he made his bed, let him lie in it&quot; is always said in a <br/>
meanspirited way.  My granny used it a lot.  She was a vindictive woman who enjoyed <br/>
seeing others suffer.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has &quot;made a bed&quot; in a parent/child situation, it&#39;s the parent who <br/>
chose to have a child, chose to keep it, and in the case of homeschoolers, <br/>
chose to keep him home with her.  Having CHOSEN that bed, the parent needs to find <br/>
a way to be comfortable and productive there.   <br/>
<br/>
Blaming a child for bad management of the situation is not comfortable or <br/>
productive.<br/>
