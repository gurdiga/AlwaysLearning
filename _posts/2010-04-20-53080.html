<div id="ygrps-yiv-36325816">I thought today&#39;s interview with the Yablonski/Biegler family went very well.  Even though they were asked to respond to some of the negative comments from the ABC website, they were able to stay on message.  It was great that they brought up all the travel and activities their children are involved in.  And even though I have some issues with Pat Farenga, for the purposes of GMA, I thought it was great to have a &quot;guy in the suit expert&quot; there.   They may have even convinced George Stephanopoulos that we&#39;re not crazy.  Well done!<br/>
