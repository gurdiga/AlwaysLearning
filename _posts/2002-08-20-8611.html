<br/>
My husband and I play EQ, and have for some time.  I<br/>
used to have my own guild on Drinal, but we didn&#39;t<br/>
like the server and changed to Ayonae Ro.  It&#39;s a good<br/>
server, even if the GMs are not very creative.  We had<br/>
problems with our initial guild there, so we started<br/>
another.  It is all adults though, and we are kinda<br/>
rowdy, so we may not be the best guild if your kids<br/>
want to play.  We are not the tamest bunch, and we<br/>
cuss in guild speak (gasp!) and tell adult jokes.  My<br/>
husband and I are both officers in the guild.  <br/>
<br/>
The guild is Blessed Union of Drunkards.  So if you<br/>
get into Ayonae Ro and type /who all Blessed you will<br/>
get a list of which of our folks are online.  There is<br/>
a long story behind that name, but it is a combination<br/>
of a joke, and flippin the bird to Verant (the folks<br/>
who manage the game) for rejecting our first three<br/>
choices for guild name.  The name is supposed to<br/>
reflect our rowdy and fun loving nature, and is a sort<br/>
of therapy for me, with my alcoholic family<br/>
background.  It reminds me to relax and let go about<br/>
it a little, although we (my husband and I) do not<br/>
drink at all in real life.<br/>
<br/>
If you just want some hints and tips in game and are<br/>
not interested in the guild, we would still be happy<br/>
to help you out.  It is a complex game to learn, but<br/>
lots of fun.  It is particularly nice for us to be<br/>
able to role play (which is a hobby we enjoy) without<br/>
having to drag our kids out anywhere for games, which<br/>
has always been difficult at best.  The boys like to<br/>
watch us play too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-992810068">Hi Chris.<br/>
My wife and I play Everquest as well.  We play on the Ayonae Ro Server and are officers in a guild we helped form.  Ayonae Ro is a newer server but was a split from 3 older servers so there is a high amount of higher level players.  We really like the Ayonae Ro server as most everyone we have encountered has been very friendly and polite.  I don&#39;t know how many members are actually Unschoolers as most of our members are either in college or in the work force.<br/>
If you are interested, we are currently playing Kharamanti and Vannyvay, her Dark Elven Enchanter and my Dark Elven Wizard.  We are usually online Monday through Wednesday evenings and sometimes on Sunday.  You can also contact any of our guild members.  Our guild is the Blessed Union of Drunkards and you can get a list of members by doing a &quot;/who all Blessed&quot;<br/>
If interested, just give us a /tell.<br/>

Hi to all,<br/>
<br/>
I wondering if any of you (or your children) play EverQuest. We are just<br/>
getting started and are trying to figure out which would be the best server.<br/>
If anyone knows of a guild or group that has an unusually high unschool<br/>
membership that would certainly help.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
