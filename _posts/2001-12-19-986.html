Feeding of the 5000? Everyone I know takes it literally.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s tough for me (I have a conservative family and dh, who take the<br/>
entire Bible literally) is that 10 yo ds is now asking the obvious<br/>
questions: Who did Cain marry? How did people live so long? Are fossils<br/>
real? I give him the answer I grew up with and then I give him a couple of<br/>
other answers so that he can see there are many sides out there.  (Last<br/>
week, after pondering Islam, was: How do we know which is the true religion?<br/>
Sometimes I don&#39;t have answers!)<br/>
Karen<br/>
P.S. But I gave him one anyway: I said you use the brain God gave you to see<br/>
what makes sense. You see if it fits the Bible, if you believe in the Bible.<br/>
But eventually, you take a leap of faith. It always boils down to that<br/>
anyway, whether Christian, atheist, or whatever.<br/>

I disagree about that &quot;leap of faith&quot; claim.<br/>
It&#39;s a comfort to Christians to say &quot;everyone depends on faith.&quot;<br/>

To tell a child to use the brain God gave him but if something doesn&#39;t fit <br/>

<br/>
When I don&#39;t know something I say &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;<br/>
When I think nobody really knows, I have no problem saying &quot;Nobody really <br/>
knows, but lots of people have theories.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Literalists say all answers are in the Bible.  And so some kids start off <br/>
early believing that.  Holly was told a few months ago that the Bible said <br/>
Christians couldn&#39;t go see the Harry Potter movie.   I&#39;m thinking the child <br/>
who told her that really believes that the Bible is dispensing movie reviews <br/>
and current dictates.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up in a Southern Baptist church, and so I know how preachers use the <br/>
Bible to tell you whether to buy a foreign or domestic automobile and who to <br/>
vote for and all that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-807124080">Christianity is the least comfortable situation I could be in. It would be a<br/>
relief to be atheist and rely only on my own brain, but God&#39;s thumped me in<br/>
the head too many times to do that. I was thinking of faith in science (or<br/>
more to the point, scientists), yes, but also faith in other thinkers, faith<br/>
in yourself, faith in the natural world. To me, &quot;faith&quot; has much more than a<br/>
religious meaning. It&#39;s the decision to leap into the unknown with whatever<br/>
you want to live with, even if it&#39;s nothing.<br/>
<br/>
Whoa there, I said if something fits the Bible *if you believe in the<br/>
Bible*. That&#39;s up to him whether he does or not. But in Bible believers, it<br/>
seems to matter :)<br/>
<br/>
I say &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; and &quot;there are different theories&quot; all the time. I&#39;m a<br/>
little rabid on the point of not raising him the way I was raised. I&#39;ll see<br/>
your Southern Baptist and raise you a Church of Christ (omg, not literally!)<br/>
The Baptists were way more liberal than we were (in the pathetic little town<br/>
I went to high school in), only the Assembly of God were stricter. I still<br/>
feel a little decadent when I wear shorts.<br/>

John&#39;s an interesting book.  It was written much later than the other<br/>

needed to be recorded, since eating flesh/bread and drinking blood/wine was<br/>
now the central act of Christian worship.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The take I&#39;ve heard on it which makes the most sense (to me) is that someone<br/>
in the crowd offered his or her five loaves and fishes to share.  The<br/>
miracle is that this began a domino effect (similar to the &quot;pass it forward&quot;<br/>
concept) ...and everyone began sharing what they had,  so that not there was<br/>
abundance beyond everyone&#39;s need when all were willing to be open and share.<br/>
    In the days Jesus preached, many people would likely have had the<br/>
forethought to carry some food with them as they wandered,  travelled by<br/>
foot.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1112267206">I&#39;m not the one you were asking, but my answer is that it&#39;s a part of <br/>
our human sin nature to have faith in ourselves so everyone at some <br/>
point or other does, but our goal as Christians should be to have <br/>
faith *only* in God.  To have faith in yourself means that you have to <br/>
rely on the understanding of a human mind that can&#39;t possibly fathom <br/>
all that God knows.  &quot;Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean <br/>
not on your own understanding.  In all your ways acknowledge Him and <br/>
He will direct your paths&quot;.  <br/>

go in a (dang if I can&#39;t remember the name of it) container near the <br/>

pass it, because they believe the actual body of Christ is there.  I <br/>
seem to recall that there is a special place where the wafers go when <br/>

 </span></blockquote>If I remember my catechism from years ago correctly, the priest gets God to<br/>
make the change during mass.  It happens as the priest raises the challis<br/>
holding filled with bread and wine.  So it doesn&#39;t matter what the<br/>
parishioner does later during their communion, swallow or not. It is still<br/>
the body and blood. Leftovers are put in the tabernacle on the alter.<br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s a moment when it&#39;s blessed.  At the church I went to most,   altar <br/>
boys would ring a set of little bells (like four fastened together/cast <br/>
together) at the moment of the elevation of the host.<br/>
<br/>
Once it&#39;s blessed/activated, it has to be treated really specially.  The <br/>
priest finishes any crumbs.  There&#39;s a kind of ceremony if a piece is <br/>
dropped.  There are some procedures for &quot;host to go&quot; (like bedridden folk <br/>
might get home delivery).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s one of the differences between Latin and Greek Christianity.  The<br/>
Greek word is &quot;mystery,&quot; not &quot;sacrament.&quot;  The Greeks simply never asked the<br/>
question of &quot;when&quot;; it would never have occured to them.   I think the issue<br/>
of Transubstantiation arose in Catholicism&#39;s scholastic period, which the<br/>
East never experienced.  The closest thing to an answer I&#39;ve heard was when<br/>
a priest was reminding people to show up on time, that the entire liturgy --<br/>
the &quot;common work&quot; of the people -- is necessary; you can&#39;t just show up<br/>
right before the Anaphora (consecration) like it was take-out you ordered<br/>
ahead.  <br/>
<br/>
The Greek word &quot;mysterion&quot; means something made present, not something<br/>
hidden.  The Body and Blood are made present in the bread and wine, but I<br/>
don&#39;t think anyone imagines the bread and wine transform into actual human<br/>
flesh and blood.  (I speak as an Orthodox, though, with no personal<br/>
experience of Catholicism; I could certainly be wrong.)  The manner in which<br/>
communion is prepared and distributed is different between the Orthodox<br/>
liturgy and the Catholic mass, too.  We use loaves of bread, baked at home<br/>
by a member of the congregation each week, rather than wafers.  It would<br/>
take too long to explain all the details: suffice to say, each person is<br/>
served a combination of bread, wine and water on a spoon, from a common<br/>
chalice.  Only a priest or deacon can serve; we have no Eucharistic<br/>
ministers.<br/>
<br/>
The consecrated Host is handled carefully, of course; cloth napkins are held<br/>
beneath the communicant&#39;s chin to catch spills.  Anything left in the cup is<br/>
consumed by the deacon.  Five or more loaves are brought each week, with one<br/>
selected for communion.  The rest are sliced up into small pieces, and then<br/>
distributed as you receive communion.  This bread, called &quot;antidoran&quot; in<br/>
Greek, is blessed but not consecrated, so you can take it home, and<br/>
non-Orthodox may receive it.  The crumbs are scattered for the birds.<br/>
<br/>
There are similarities between a liturgy and a mass, but some differences:<br/>
There is only one liturgy in a 24-hour period; you don&#39;t get to pick which<br/>
Mass to go to.  A priest never &quot;does&quot; a liturgy if there are no people<br/>
present, and he faces the altar with his back to the people, since everyone<br/>
is thought of as serving, not just him.  If the church is correctly<br/>
appointed, it will have no pews or seats; everyone stands, and those Russian<br/>
services can get long!  If there are seats in the way, you can&#39;t move with<br/>
the processions, you just spin around in one place.  It does help keep the<br/>
kids from taking off, though :-)  Oh, that&#39;s another difference: infants are<br/>
baptised and immediately chrismated; they don&#39;t wait for their first<br/>
communion at an older age.<br/>
<br/>
(I was going to answer the question with a line from The Prisoner:<br/>
&quot;That would be telling.&quot;  After that tome, you probably wish I had!)<br/>
