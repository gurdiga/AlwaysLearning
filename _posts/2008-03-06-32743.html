<div id="ygrps-yiv-1186939364">Hi,<br/>
I have been reading a lot of the discussions on here and they have<br/>
helped very much. We shifted from homeschooling to unschooling last<br/>
year and have been slowly moving to a better understanding with<br/>
regards to learning and respectful parenting. I thought maybe I could<br/>
get some help with ideas on how to deal with some behaviors of my 2<br/>
year old. <br/>
These are throwing food all over the floor, taking a mouthful of<br/>
milk(or any drink)and spitting it on the floor, furniture and <br/>
sometimes his sisters, slamming our french doors. Things that I have done:<br/>
picked him up and brought him somewhere else to do something else,<br/>
told him no don&#39;t do that, taken the food drink away for the time<br/>
being, given him only a little at a time ( less clean up for me) asked<br/>
him to help clean it(sometimes he does sometimes he doesn&#39;t). He was 2<br/>
last December. I also have 3 girls ages 13,10, and 5. <br/>
If anyone has any ideas for me I would be thankful I am getting tired<br/>
of cleaning up!<br/>

I would yell NO.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a difference between saying &quot;NO&quot; and then going on to spank  <br/>
or shame or put him in time out.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t throw food.&quot;  That seems simple.  If he keeps throwing it,  <br/>
don&#39;t give it to him.  Give him a bite at a time when he&#39;s hungry.<br/>
<br/>
Put a rubber strip so the door can&#39;t be slammed or one of the piston  <br/>
door-closing things that closes the door slowly after someone goes  <br/>
through, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
But &quot;Don&#39;t slam the door&quot; seems reasonable.  Spanking doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Saying &quot;Don&#39;t use the door at all if you&#39;re going to slam it&quot; seems  <br/>
reasonable.<br/>

Are the girls getting him to behave badly for fun?  I&#39;ve seen older  <br/>
kids do that.  If so, remind them he&#39;s not a monkey, and they should  <br/>
be helping him be a good person.  (If not, never mind.)<br/>

giving him a bite at a time. No, we don&#39;t spank or do time out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2068860178">I&#39;ve thrown a towel over the tops of doors to keep my kids from slamming them.<br/>

It&#39;s fast and free. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1188188451">-=-I have tried yelling no,well hubby has. He laughs-=-<br/>
<br/>
Then I would pick up all the food and say it&#39;s not nice to laugh at  <br/>
people, and it&#39;s not nice to throw food.<br/>
If he asked for food, I would say &quot;To eat or to throw?&quot; and make it  <br/>
really clear that eating was the only right answer.<br/>
<br/>
Or IF and when you want to let kids throw food, make it clear that  <br/>
it&#39;s an exception, a special occasion.  We&#39;ve thrown eggs off the  <br/>
deck (cracked in the carton and so not safe), and pumpkins off the  <br/>
deck, or jack-o-lanterns.  We threw eggs at the back fence (flat  <br/>
board fence, like a wooden wall) when the kids were little so they  <br/>
could have the experience, and see how long the egg stays.  I know  <br/>
for sure it helped them not have the urge to throw eggs at houses or  <br/>
cars.  The egg stuff is gross a day or four later.<br/>
<br/>
Give them opportunities to throw stuff--sticks into a river, rocks  <br/>
into a lake, dirt clods at a wall.  They NEED to throw things.  Let  <br/>
them get it out of their system in a harmless way and then say no  <br/>
about throwing food in the house.<br/>
