<div id="ygrps-yiv-2117075312">Someone who&#39;s joining the discussion wrote that their family was &quot;leaning more towards an autonomous/un-schooling approach.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That reminded me that some months back I told some folks in the UK that I would bring up the difference.  <br/>
<br/>
Year before last, in an after-hours conversation with some of the speakers at a conference in the UK, Mike Fortune-Wood did admit that &quot;autonomous education&quot; (which he and his ex-wife had promoted and protected) was not ever the same as unschooling.   <br/>
<br/>
For years, when people mentioned unschooling on UK discussions, someone would say &quot;We call it &#39;autonomous ed&#39;.&quot;  And sometimes Brits in international discussions would interject that &quot;unschooling&quot; wasn&#39;t a term to use in the UK, but that it was the same as autonomous education.  <br/>
<br/>
All along I was sure it was not the same, and when Mike confirmed it, I was too busy to tell people. :-)  <br/>
I&#39;m still pretty busy, but I&#39;m glad for the catalyst.<br/>
<br/>
So for those in the UK, they&#39;re not the same (as many have figured out over the years).  <br/>
And for those NOT in the UK, the term &quot;autonomous&quot; when used as an ideal way to see a child, or a child&#39;s learning, is almost the opposite of the &quot;attachment&quot; in attachment parenting, or the partnership in &quot;be your child&#39;s partner, not his adversary.&quot;  <br/>

<br/>
A family might like to feel autonomous, but to expect a child to be &quot;autonomous&quot; within the family is distancing.<br/>
<br/>
I think that the &quot;autonomous&quot; in autonomous ed is a political position—separate from the state curriculum, perhaps, and not aligned with a particular distance learning situation or some such. <br/>
<br/>
If there are others here with other takes on it, it might be helpful for future questions or comparisons or claims of sameness.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1530871133">This is very interesting Sandra. The Pam Sorooshian article explains really well what unschooling is and is not. I would say that that IS what autonomous learning is too. In the early years with our kids we thought we were doing autonomous ed but, after reading here what Mike Fortune Wood  said, I&#39;m not sure! Maybe it was always unschooling. So I&#39;d love to know what you understand the differences to be? If the autonomous term has to do with a political position is it possible for a family to be unschooling and educating autonomously at the same time? In my mind autonomous means that the child isn&#39;t forced into learning any particular thing in any particular way, as per school. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1047729191">I&#39;m from the UK, although now in Australia. I agree that autonomous as<br/>
perceived by most British people I know, is not the same thing as<br/>
unschooling. People using &#39;autonomous&#39; tend to mean &#39;Child-lead&#39;. Generally!<br/>
<br/>
However, because unschooling is still a fairly unfamiliar term in the UK,<br/>
not least with the authorities that claim to &#39;monitor&#39; home educators, I<br/>
have known some families that in my opinion ARE unschooling, yet call it<br/>
&#39;autonomous education&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
When I submitted a report to our authority a couple of years ago, I too<br/>
described our approach as autonomous. I don&#39;t think that was helpful to<br/>
unschoolers in the long term, but I wanted a quick acceptance of my approach<br/>
and I knew that this was a term they recognised. Here in Australia it<br/>
appears that &#39;Natural Learning&#39; is the accepted terminology by the<br/>
authorities, although I&#39;m still learning about this.<br/>
<br/>
It does matter, what we call things, because unschooling resources are not<br/>
necessarily to be found by googling &#39;autonomous&#39;. Unschooling is a very<br/>
specific thing, and it is so much more than being &#39;child-lead&#39;.<br/>

Self-governing learning. Independent learning. Self-determined learning. The phrase can be understood to apply to parents who aren&#39;t following a government dictated curriculum. The parents are making it up the course of learning themselves. And that can apply to what&#39;s called unschooling in the US or to any way of learning that isn&#39;t government dictated.</div><div><br></div><div>But the phrase &quot;autonomous learning&quot; already had a meaning, at least in the US. It means a person of any age who has taken control of their own learning. Generally it&#39;s been embraced by teens and young adults who are rejecting educational courses laid out by others and pursuing their own path. Traditionally it will look very focused and perhaps even academic.</div><div><br></div><div>&quot;Autonomous learners&quot; *does* get tossed about casually to mean unschooling. But that&#39;s just confusing. It creates a picture of kids who are doing all the driving of their learning while their parents step back to take care of their physical needs.</div><div><br></div><div>So asking a variety of people whether you can be &quot;unschooling and educating autonomously&quot; will just get you a wide range of confusing answers &nbsp;;-)</div><div><br></div><div>Communication happens when I get an idea in my head into your head. People *think* that just by putting their ideas into words, that when another hears those words, that means the other person then has the idea. But that&#39;s not true. If we don&#39;t both have the same definitions for the words I use, then you may form a very different idea from my words. That&#39;s why all the focus here on choosing words carefully. Communication isn&#39;t as easy as just talking!</div><div><br></div><div>&quot;Educating autonomously&quot; is one of those phrases that can&#39;t be confidently used to convey an idea. As Christine points out, the term is best used in a formal context with authorities who recognize the word. Using &quot;unschooling&quot; will just confuse them. But using &quot;autonomous learning&quot; outside that context, will confuse more than communicate.</div><div><br></div><div>Joyce</div></html></div>
