<div id="ygrps-yiv-1961045105">And you think *4* partners for this girl is a lot?<br/>
<br/>
Hmmmm...I think sex is natural and wonderful, and I would never encourage my<br/>
children not to do it....<br/>
<br/>
Condoms are easy to use, but mutual masturbation is even better.<br/>
<br/>
I would certainly not advocate holding off on sex just because I wasn&#39;t<br/>
ready to have a child....hell, I wouldn&#39;t have had sex until well into my<br/>
first year of marriage.  lol...I guess that&#39;s the point of abstinence until<br/>
marriage, eh?  I never thought of that before....<br/>
<br/>
Snort.....None of that here!!<br/>

Never?<br/>
Not even if you saw potential dangers with a certain person?  Like a girl <br/>
that was trying to get away from an abusive home situation?<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a healthy balance between honoring a healthy sexual appetite and <br/>
being wise and prudent where your health is concerned.<br/>
It&#39;s good to be aware of AIDS and people that you don&#39;t want to be in a <br/>
sexual relation with. That doesn&#39;t equal &quot;wait until you&#39;re married&quot; or <br/>
making sex out to be anything less than natural.<br/>
I wasn&#39;t advocating that!<br/>
But I will certainly help my children be aware of potential dangers in <br/>
addition to the wonderful, great parts of sex too. Sex is not only pleasure, <br/>
it is incredibly powerful because of the ability to create a new life and <br/>
form deep bonds.<br/>
It&#39;s can be profound and sacred, and it can be casual and quick too.<br/>
<br/>
But being aware of health dangers and the kind of people you may want to <br/>
avoid, is giving them important information imo.<br/>

I&#39;ve read about some of these studies and some have held up very well.<br/>
The idea that our bodies get used to certain bacteria and learn how to deal <br/>
with it is fairly common knowledge.<br/>
Babies are more immune to the type of bacteria that are in their own homes <br/>
and more susceptable in others.<br/>
Sexual partners carry their own bacteria. Our bodies are going to have a <br/>
difficult time adjusting to, and being immune to bacteria if you have a new <br/>
sex partner often.<br/>
Being with the same partner gives your body a chance to get used to that <br/>
persons particular bacteria, thereby preventing a lot of potential health <br/>
risks.<br/>
On top of that, there is always a risk that the person would lie to you, or <br/>
carry something they don&#39;t know about.<br/>
<br/>
Sure, condoms prevent a lot. But to act like they&#39;re foolproof is ridiculous. <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t be here if that was the case.  And young people all too often get <br/>
caught up in hormones and don&#39;t use a condom.  Having lots of information on <br/>
all sides is the best way for someone to make the best decision for <br/>
themselves at any given moment.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-786835615">Here&#39;s a little snippet from one site out of MANY that cite research <br/>
discussing the link between multiple sex partners and health problems.<br/>
There is even a recent study that pointed to increased prostate cancer in men <br/>
that have multiple sex partners, although that one is less conclusive.<br/>
There was a lot of information linking many different problems, not just <br/>
cervical cancer, to the multiple sex partners and also a link to early sex <br/>
(before age 18). I don&#39;t know how they separate the two though, need to read <br/>
more.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Risk Factors of Cervical Cancer<br/>
<br/>
Researchers have identified certain risk factors that increase the chance <br/>
that cells in the cervix will become abnormal or cancerous. They believe <br/>
that, in many cases, cervical cancer develops when two or more risk factors <br/>
act together.<br/>
<br/>
Research has shown that women who began having sexual intercourse before age <br/>
18 and women who have had many sexual partners have an increased risk of <br/>
developing cervical cancer. Women also are at increased risk if their <br/>
partners began having sexual intercourse at a young age, have had many sexual <br/>
partners, or were previously married to women who had cervical cancer (high <br/>
risk ?).<br/>
<br/>
Research suggests that some sexually transmitted viruses (Human Papilloma <br/>
Virus) can cause cells in the cervix to begin the series of changes that can <br/>
lead to cancer. Women who have had many sexual partners or whose partners <br/>
have had many sexual partners may have an increased risk for cervical cancer <br/>
at least in part because they are more likely to be exposed to the HPV. <br/>
<br/>
Smoking also increases the risk of cancer of the cervix. The risk appears to <br/>
increase with the number of cigarettes a woman smokes each day and with the <br/>
number of years she has smoked.<br/>
<br/>
Several reports suggest that women whose immune systems are weakened are more <br/>
likely than others to develop cervical cancer. For example, women who have <br/>
the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes AIDS, are at increased <br/>
risk. Also, organ transplant patients, who receive drugs that suppress the <br/>
immune system to prevent rejection of the new organ, are more likely than <br/>
others to develop precancerous lesions.<br/>
<br/>
Some researchers believe that there is an increased risk of cervical cancer <br/>
in women who use oral contraceptives (the pill). However, scientists have not <br/>
found that the pill directly causes cancer of the cervix. This relationship <br/>
is hard to prove because the two main risk factors for cervical <br/>
cancer--intercourse at an early age and multiple sex partners--may be more <br/>
common among women who use the pill than among those who do not. Still, oral <br/>
contraceptive labels warn of this possible risk and advise women who use them <br/>
to have yearly Pap tests.<br/>
