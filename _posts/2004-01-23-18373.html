CBS has refused to play Move On&#39;s &quot;Bush in 30 Seconds&quot; ad during the<br/>
superbowl, siting it as &quot;too controversial.&quot;  I am dumbfounded.  The one<br/>
that was voted the best is so benign compared to what we could say about<br/>
Bush.  To see the winner, Child&#39;s Pay, and to send CBS a message, go here:<br/>
