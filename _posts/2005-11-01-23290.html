<div id="ygrps-yiv-1121432478">we just got back from Wal-Mart about 45 minutes ago - I think we were second<br/>
to get the game BattleFront 2, no lines, yay! - ds had been counting the<br/>
days, scouring the website for any new tidbit until it came out.<br/>
We played other games to pass the time - we finished Bard&#39;s Tale a few days<br/>
ago, very very funny, the songs were hilarious, &quot;Beer, Beer, Beer&quot; and &quot;Bad<br/>
Luck (to be you)&quot;. We played the old ps game Crash Team Racing (one of my<br/>
favs)and of course the first BattleFront.<br/>
<br/>
off to watch the new game ; )<br/>
