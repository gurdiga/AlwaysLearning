<div id="ygrps-yiv-1001579947">It might not be &quot;Grover and the Everything in the Whole Wide World  <br/>
Museum&quot; but this site is pretty cool!<br/>
<br/>
It shows art in collections all over the world, as if you were walking  <br/>
through the galleries (photographed with robots!). You can look at  <br/>
individual paintings and zoom in on the details, read notes about the  <br/>
artwork and the artists, hear audio commentary, learn more about the  <br/>
museums and other works. You can even create a collection of your own!<br/>

I&#39;m not close to done going through the seventeen museums, but I  <br/>
stumbled upon this painting in the Uffizzi Gallery in Florence, Italy.  <br/>
So beautiful (the artist&#39;s name was augmented with his illumination  <br/>
technique) - and it&#39;s been there since 1796!<br/>

<br/>
I also found it fun to compare the works at Alte Nationalegallerie in  <br/>
Berlin to those at the Italian one, both for the choice of art to  <br/>
display (more religious themes in Italy) and for the differences in  <br/>
immediate impact on me. The Italian gallery choices are riots of color  <br/>
which I love; the German ones are much more subdued. It&#39;ll be  <br/>
interesting to see how the other countries&#39; galleries compare in theme  <br/>
and style.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>
