<div id="ygrps-yiv-230155167">So….<br/>
This is an odd one.   Crooked Brains is a blog that collects 8 or 10 examples of some similar technology or gadget and then releases a blogpost.  Today’s is about toothbrushes.<br/>
<br/>
Most of these involve power or electronic interface.  Two are game controllers, and one has feedback from an app on a phone.  I sent the link to Kirby and Marty with this note:<br/>
<br/>
________<br/>
<br/>
Like someone not walking because they’ve left the fitbit at home or the battery’s dead, this could easily cause kids not to brush their teeth because there’s no internet, or the phone was dropped in the sink and isn’t working.  <br/>
_________<br/>
<br/>
This might be the most tangible example of what Alfie Kohn (not an unschooling proponent, but many here are familiar with some of his work) talks about in Punished by Rewards.  <br/>
<br/>
But more than anything else, keep the phone away from running water, and sinks, and the very-nearby toilet! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Although we have often recommended here that people can do two things at once, and not to worry if kids are eating while playing, or to encourage conversation while driving, sometimes, if something less desirable or easy is sweetened up by a reward, then the absence of the rewarding aspect can extinguish the less-desireable action.  <br/>
<br/>
But am I wrong about this one?  Will those kids think of that video game years after they’ve outgrown it, and have a more positive memory and association with tooth brushing?  <br/>
<br/>
It’s too early for them to get any stats or data, so based on the principles unschoolers use learning and peace and choices, what are some guesses?  <br/>
<br/>
Here’s something for those unfamiliar with what Kohn shares about studies that have been done on the problems with rewards. <br/>

When my son was younger we would play games while I brushed his teeth. A favorite was to find all kinds of &nbsp;animals in his mouth ..... &quot;Oh, wow there are three monkeys back there .... wait they are trying to get away ..... got them ....&quot; The game wasn&#39;t a reward for toothbrushing but a fun thing to do while getting something boring done.&nbsp;</div><div>I play sometimes solitaire while brushing. Besides of the obvious danger of loosing a device to water it actually often makes me brush longer because I play (and brush) until I win at least once. I guess in that case the teeth cleanliness is opposite proportional to my &nbsp;solitaire skills ..... :))&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Sabine&nbsp;<br><div id="ygrps-yiv-641572038mail-app-auto-default-signature"><br><br>Sent from myMail for iOS<br></div><br><br>Saturday, May 7, 2016, 08:53 -0700 from AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com  &lt;AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com&gt;:<br>    <div id="ygrps-yiv-641572038composeWebView_previouse_content"><blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote id="ygrps-yiv-641572038mail-app-auto-quote" style="border-left:1px solid #fc2c38;margin:10px 10px 10px 5px;padding:0 0 0 10px;"><div class="ygrps-yiv-641572038js-helper ygrps-yiv-641572038js-readmsg-msg">

Nice. :-)<br/>

I would sing the days of the week, to the tune of Yankee Doodle.  I would say “I’m going to brush your teeth for a month!” and do “a week” in each quadrant) for young kids with not so many teeth).  Sometimes another week for the top front and one for the bottom front.  So before they even knew or cared what those words were, or what “a month” was, they had weeks, months, days of the week, and their teeth brushed. <br/>
