<div id="ygrps-yiv-1125582290">This is fairly off topic, and I&#39;m sorry, but for those playing  <br/>
Neopets, this is the week in which five game scores can be sent per  <br/>
day rather than just three.   If anyone&#39;s having an antsy week or  <br/>
looking for something soothing to do, there&#39;s a possibility.  If you  <br/>
only play Neopets occasionally, this might be a good occasion.<br/>
<br/>
And in December (I won&#39;t remind people again then, in order to keep  <br/>
my off-topic posts only semi-annual or so), there&#39;s an advent- <br/>
calendar prize every day.<br/>

<br/>
The art there is often very cute, so even if your kids are too young  <br/>
to play the games they might like the &quot;prizes&quot; and the animations.<br/>
