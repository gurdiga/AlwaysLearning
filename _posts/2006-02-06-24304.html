<div id="ygrps-yiv-1413092537">Really, local stuff shouldn&#39;t be on lists like this.<br/>
<br/>
None of it&#39;s new.  It&#39;s as easily ignored as it ever was. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This would be better handled on the unschoolarama list, or by e- <br/>
mail.   My e-mail address is on most of the webpages: http:// <br/>
