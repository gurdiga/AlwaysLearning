<div id="ygrps-yiv-1074584006">&quot;Thanx Ren, your post really helped.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad.<br/>
<br/>
I think there is a certain &quot;look&quot; in our society that is acceptable for a Mom and we tend to conform. But for those of us that love funky colors and styles, it is stifling a part of us we can&#39;t deny.<br/>
I had exactly two people come up to me at the conference and say &quot;you look like how I feel inside, but I just haven&#39;t had the (fill in the blank here: time/guts etc...) to actually do anything about it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I loved that they were so honest with me, that they were drawn to the bright colors, jewelry etc... but I thought that they shouldn&#39;t ignore that part of themselves that loves those things either.:)<br/>
<br/>
I think my stifling past is making the pendulum swing the other way...now I&#39;m looking at WIGS!! Sheesh. My hair seems to get funkier with each passing month and I can&#39;t seem to pass up chunky beads anymore. I&#39;ve been wearing tiny braids and spiky bits this last week, my friends are worried that I&#39;ll have it shaved one day. I guess I&#39;ll keep them wondering.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1375539005">My favorite doctor was the doctor I had when I was pregnant with my first 2 boys.  She had wild, flamboyant red hair and she always wore purple.  I loved it that she didn&#39;t look like a doctor at all.  She had one son at the time who was around 5-7 years old.  I used to run into her and her son all the time at Renassance Fairs and cool stuff like that.  She was the best, but she moved away from here.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oooooooooooo, shaving is good. I did mine on and off for the last 3 <br/>
years. It felt weird the first time and I got a few looks in the street <br/>
especially as I wear combat trousers, t-shirts with skulls on and <br/>
assorted jewellry. When I arrived in Virginia I had pink spiky hair. <br/>
Then I shaved most of it off after seeing Tank Girl, then let it grow <br/>
again. My Mother in Law keeps hinting I should settle down now I&#39;m <br/>
35.....usually that makes me go do soemthing spiky and colourful again :-)<br/>
Now I&#39;m feeling boring again. I had the sides shaved but the top is now <br/>
long enough to cover it and I feel like Stepford mum.<br/>
When I&#39;m 106 I&#39;ll get that denim jumper.....<br/>

See?  Because I don&#39;t want Holly to grow up wild like Ren, I&#39;ve always let <br/>
her do weird hair/make-up/clothes. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
NO!  Honestly, Ren has been Holly&#39;s make-up fairy!!  I know zip about what <br/>
would be really cool for a kid who loves femininity row.  Ren does, though, and <br/>
has twice given Holly care packages.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid I had to wait until I was fifteen to wear make-up, fifteen <br/>
to &quot;go on dates,&quot; sixteen to stay out after midnight, etc.<br/>
<br/>
So when those times came by GOD I wore make-up.  I made SURE I had a date and <br/>
stayed out until 11:59:59.<br/>
<br/>
It was stupid.  I was only doing the make-up because I had waited so long for <br/>
this rite of passage.<br/>
<br/>
So we let Holly dress however, get her ears pierced, wear make-up, do <br/>
whatever to her hair, and so she&#39;s doing all the freaky weird stuff as a cute little <br/>
girl, and by the time she&#39;s of that more dangerous age, she&#39;ll either have it <br/>
somewhat out of her system or she&#39;ll be really artsy with it, one or the <br/>
other. &lt;g&gt;  Probably some of both.  But she won&#39;t be desperate to try something she <br/>
never was allowed to before.<br/>
<br/>
Even though my dad rarely went to church, he had a very Church of the <br/>
Nazarene attitude toward women&#39;s appearances.  My mom did the 40&#39;s/50&#39;s  hair curling <br/>
and red lipstick, but my dad didn&#39;t think little girls should cut their hair <br/>
or wear make-up or wear pants.  I got my ears pierced at 15, because I had <br/>
waited and waited and it was TIME, but that was against my dad&#39;s advice, and with <br/>
my  more liberal mom&#39;s permission.<br/>
<br/>
Since I never saw Ren in her more conservative days, I think she looks just <br/>
simply like the way she writes and talks, so she might be shocking her <br/>
relatives a bit, but she&#39;s just looking cute and colorful to me.<br/>
