<br/>
but I kinda hate to just be advertising for something like this.  I&#39;m <br/>
hesitant, and yet it seems potentially useful and encouraging, and the more people <br/>
who know about and use such early programs the bigger they&#39;ll become.   <br/>
Hmmm.....    Any arguments for or against linking this?  Anyone read a review of it <br/>
anywhere or feel like tracking up a website?  I&#39;m guessing from his addresses he <br/>
has one:<br/>

I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s elife101, but I&#39;m not in the mood to hunt him down and <br/>
thought perhaps someone here might be.   Anyway, here&#39;s what he sent and it&#39;s kind <br/>
of intriguing, but DAMNED schooly. &lt;g&gt;  On the other hand, I with people <br/>
would offer free information.  On the other hand...  And he&#39;s in MS and I have <br/>
that nagging prejudice about fundamentalist Christian dads making money off <br/>
homeschoolers instead of getting real jobs, but on the other hand he might be a <br/>
perfectly normal person. And &quot;Nautilus&quot; is no Bible reference.<br/>

I dunno.  Oxford, MS has its little liberal haven.  It is a university town <br/>
(Ole Miss).  This is probably a professor at the college. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1779485985">Maybe you could get him to send you a review copy so that you&#39;d know whether it was worth sharing or not?  Also, ask him to provide a bio or creditionals or something (which would now that I think about it, probably be in or on the book). <br/>
<br/>
If it is a great book, then you could just grit your teeth and describe it, even if he were a fundamentalist.  ; - ) <br/>

Ummm, I think some people could benefit.  I think most people who have been <br/>
unschooling for a long time wouldn&#39;t have to be introduced to the idea of early <br/>
college, and might turn to the book for ideas.  Newer unschoolers might find <br/>
it odd, but then they&#39;re going to find a lot of odd stuff on your site.  ;)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Early College Programs<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I got this review off of Amazon:<br/>
&lt;&lt;I recently read EARLY COLLEGE PROGRAMS, and wrote a review <br/>
for &quot;Bookpage,&quot; the independent booksellers&#39; national newspaper. <br/>
Below are a few sections of that review:<br/>
<br/>
EARLY COLLEGE PROGRAMS is the first book ever written on the <br/>
relatively little known summer college programs specially designed <br/>
for high school students. Such programs seemingly exist for college-<br/>
bound high school students who seek to out-wit the competition when <br/>
their fate is determined at college admissions time.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the early college programs that this writer noticed in the <br/>
book are: &quot;Introduction to Computer Integrated Surgery&quot; at Johns <br/>
Hopkins&#39;s &quot;Hopkins Precollege Program;&quot; the &quot;International Relations <br/>
Program for High School Students&quot; at Georgetown; and, Cornell <br/>
University Summer College&#39;s &quot;Exploration in Architecture.&quot; In a <br/>
workable way, the editor has arranged these and hundreds of other <br/>
early college programs into 80 career-oriented categories such <br/>
as &quot;Toward the Making of a Surgeon,&quot; &quot;Toward the Making of a <br/>
Diplomat,&quot; &quot;Toward the Making of an Architect,&quot; and &quot;Toward the <br/>
Making of a Filmmaker.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
While some, or even many, of these early college programs have long <br/>
been known to college counselors and students at elite secondary <br/>
schools like Harvard-Westlake School in Los Angeles or Georgetown Day <br/>
School in Washington, D.C., the structure of EARLY COLLEGE PROGRAMS <br/>
attempts to appeal to virtually all college-bound high school <br/>
students in all income brackets. For example, there is a special <br/>
section for students interested in early college programs at <br/>
professional art schools, and yet another for students wishing to <br/>
attend an early college program at one of the U.S. military <br/>
academies; in other words, a high school stint at either the Rhode <br/>
Island School of Design or West Point can look pretty impressive <br/>
(perhaps extremely so) at college application time. Further, one can <br/>
go all out and spend thousands of dollars to attend <br/>
Stanford&#39;s &quot;Summer College for High School Students,&quot; or opt for the <br/>
one-week, &quot;All Girls-All Math&quot; program at the University of Nebraska <br/>
at Lincoln for just a hundred bucks. Importantly, information on <br/>
available scholarships, as well as a special section for <br/>
underrepresented youth, is included in the book, too. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The helpful part of the book might be the &quot;Toward the Making of a <br/>
[enter your career here].&quot;  If you put it on your site, you might <br/>
focus on that.<br/>
<br/>
This review is definitely written with a schooly perspective (outwit <br/>
the competition -- bah), but I could see this helping the unschooled <br/>
teen who really knows what they want to do.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
