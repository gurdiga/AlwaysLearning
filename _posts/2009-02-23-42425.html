However in following this discussion, I have come to the realization  <br/>
that<br/>
the negative label &quot;lazy&quot; informed Mum&#39;s belief about me and my view of<br/>
myself for my whole life! That is where it came from. I&#39;m kinda  <br/>
reeling a<br/>
bit, like my whole life just shifted and schismed for a moment - a  <br/>
sort of<br/>
&quot;OMG no wonder&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
###<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend whose children are in school. Her children are only  <br/>
allowed to watch tv when they are sick.<br/>
Recently, her 8 yr old said he felt ill at school, and the nurse  <br/>
called my friend to come get him. When they got home, he expected  <br/>
that he was going to get to watch tv, but my friend said there are  <br/>
lots of reasons stomachs feel sick, and one of them is when you want  <br/>
to avoid doing something like school, so until he actually threw up,  <br/>
no tv. A few hours later, he did throw up. She told me she thinks he  <br/>
forced himself to do it so he could watch tv.<br/>
<br/>
So, not only is it entirely possible that he is forcing himself to  <br/>
throw up, just to watch some tv, the other byproduct of this whole  <br/>
thing, is that he is no longer just allowed to even be sick. He has  <br/>
to prove it. She suspects that whenever he says he is sick, he is  <br/>
faking to get tv. There is no trust between them at all.<br/>
<br/>
I should also mention that at least one of her other two kids and  <br/>
herself had actually been sick within the last few days, so its  <br/>
entirely probable that he WAS sick.<br/>

<br/>
This is a very dangerous plan she has.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know much about bulimia, but I understand vaguely that there  <br/>
is damage from throwing up when one isn&#39;t really sick (and from too  <br/>
much throwing up, probably, even if one IS sick).<br/>
<br/>
Can&#39;t people chock on vomit?  Is that mom unaware of the physical  <br/>
dangers?<br/>
<br/>
Why does she even HAVE a TV if it&#39;s only for people who puke?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s worth giving her something about the dangers of puking.  Or  <br/>
not.<br/>
<br/>
Reading that made me really sad.  I read it to Holly.  There&#39;s a kid  <br/>
I&#39;d like to save, magically, over the miles.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1028106962">are the parents of that kid allowed to watch tv only when they&#39;re sick?  and who do THEY <br/>
have to prove it to? <br/>
<br/>
i&#39;d like to save those kids too.  <br/>
<br/>
bulimia can damage a lot of a person&#39;s body physically and emotionally.  i was anorexic in <br/>
my early twenties and eventually came to realize that it was (among many other factors) <br/>
the only thing i felt i could control in my life.  in my opinion, control is a bad, bad thing.  <br/>
