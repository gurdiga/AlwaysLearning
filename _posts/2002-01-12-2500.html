<div id="ygrps-yiv-435507834">&lt;&lt;It has given them each time to have mommy&#39;s<br/>
full attention for about an hour and their attitudes<br/>
have really become more positive.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Alone time is such a great way for me to learn new things about my kids. Sometimes I make assumptions about their behavior that are just not true and being alone with one helps sort these things out. And when alone, they are not the same as when we&#39;re all together. I don&#39;t remember having time alone with my mom, so this is still new and sort of amazing to me.<br/>
