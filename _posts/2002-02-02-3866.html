<div id="ygrps-yiv-294883767">&lt;&lt;someone would say, &quot;oh, and why aren&#39;t you in school<br/>
today?&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A week ago Tuesday, I was at the park.  My ds, 6, was<br/>
playing with friends, while I was walking around the<br/>
bike path with my dd, 3, who was riding her bike.  A<br/>
man jogged by & stopped to ask &quot;is school out today?&quot;,<br/>
referring to all the kids in the park.  I said &quot;no&quot;<br/>
and something about the kids being homeschooled.  He<br/>
said  &quot;all those kids?&quot;  and I said yes.  Then he<br/>
asked, &quot;is that legal?&quot;  <br/>
