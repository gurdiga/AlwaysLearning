 </span></blockquote>Puppies come toothless...(at least all of ours did, wire-haired dachshunds) <br/>
but when they do come in, AUWTCH!!!!!! needle-sharp!<br/>
<br/>
We also sleep with the window open and thick feather comforters on the bed -- <br/>
very healthy! Our house was never warm in the winter, but we did have these <br/>
really great heaters that were big rectangles filled with thermal rocks -- <br/>
they loaded heat in the night and were warm all day -- you could go sit or <br/>
lie down on them and get warm in a hurry! At night, we would conserve heat in <br/>
the big rooms of the house by letting down big heavy Rolladen (shutters) that <br/>
rolled down over the outside of the windows. We put them down and up with the <br/>
aid of a strap next to the window. They held in an amazing amount of the heat.<br/>

&gt; Any idea where I could find these? I really miss Rolladen. They help keep <br/>
&gt; the house warm in winter and cool in summer. I&#39;d like to install them in <br/>
&gt; the dream house!<br/>
