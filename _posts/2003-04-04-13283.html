<br/>
The Ten Rules of Housekeeping<br/>
<br/>
1. Vacuuming too often weakens the carpet fibers. Say this with a serious<br/>
face,<br/>
and shudder delicately whenever anyone mentions Carpet Fresh.<br/>
<br/>
2. Layers of dirty film on windows and screens provide a helpful filter<br/>
against<br/>
harmful and aging rays from the sun. Call it an SPF factor of 5 and leave it<br/>
alone.<br/>
<br/>
3. Dust bunnies should never be disturbed. Rename the area under the couch<br/>
&quot;The<br/>
Gal√°pagos Islands&quot; and claim an ecological exemption.<br/>
<br/>
4. Cobwebs artfully draped over lampshades reduces the glare from the bulb,<br/>
thereby creating a romantic atmosphere. If your husband points out that the<br/>
light fixtures need<br/>
dusting, simply look affronted and exclaim, &quot;What? And spoil the mood?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
5. In a pinch, you can always claim that the haphazard tower of unread<br/>
magazines and newspapers next to your chair provides the valuable Feng Shui<br/>
aspect of a tiger, thereby reducing your vulnerability. Roll your eyes when<br/>
you<br/>
say it, as though EVERYONE knowsthis.<br/>
<br/>
6. If dusting is really out of control, simply place a showy urn on the<br/>
coffee<br/>
table and insist, &quot;This is where Aunt Hazel wanted us to scatter her ashes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
7. If unexpected company is coming, pile everything unsightly into one room<br/>
and<br/>
close the door. As you show your guests through your tidy home, rattle the<br/>
door<br/>
knob vigorously, fake a growl and say, &quot;I&#39;d love you to see our den, but<br/>
Fluffy<br/>
hates to be disturbed and the shots are SO expensive.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
8. Explain the mound of pet hair brushed up against the doorways by claiming<br/>
you are collecting it there to use for stuffing hand-sewn play animals for<br/>
underprivileged children<br/>
<br/>
9. Don&#39;t bother repainting. Simply scribble lightly over a dirty wall with<br/>
an<br/>
assortment of crayons and try to muster a glint of tears as you say, &quot;Little<br/>
Joey did this the week before that unspeakable accident... I haven&#39;t had the<br/>
heart to clean it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
10. Mix one quarter cup pine-scented household cleanser with four cups of<br/>
water<br/>
in a spray bottle. Mist the air lightly. Leave dampened rags in conspicuous<br/>
locations. Develop an exhausted look, throw yourself onto the couch, and<br/>
sigh,<br/>
&quot;I clean and I clean and I still don&#39;t get anywhere...&quot;<br/>
