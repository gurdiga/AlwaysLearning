<div id="ygrps-yiv-1112066481">My computer desk is on the second floor of my house, and I have a window next <br/>
to my chair, which overlooks my neighbors roof. When I look out in the last <br/>
couple of weeks I am often seeing a bunch of baby squirrels playing and  <br/>
cuddling and running around on the roof. It is absolutely adorable. There are three <br/>
right now, and they are alternating between playing chase and nuzzling each <br/>
other.<br/>
<br/>
A few feet away from that, in an eave, there is a nest of sparrows. Given the <br/>
recent activities of the male and female, I expect there will be eggs and <br/>
babies soon.<br/>
<br/>
This is so cool...just thought I&#39;d share.<br/>
