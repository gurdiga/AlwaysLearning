<div id="ygrps-yiv-1991823432">The Always Learning discussion has a live version, sometimes, &quot;Always Learning Live.&quot; :-)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not too late to sign up for one in Maine, at the end of this month:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://allinmaine.blogspot.com">http://allinmaine.blogspot.com</a><br/>
I&#39;ve been getting ready to leave for Maine in less that a week, to spend time with Laurie Wolfrum there. Keith is going with me, too.<br/>
<br/>
But today I worked on the one for December in Albuquerque.  The blog is set up, I think all the links are working (though there will be more and better information as time goes on) and some speakers are confirmed:<br/>
<br/>
Hema Bharadwaj; Julie, James and Adam Daniel; Jill Parmer and Luke Davidson; Me!  (and possible one or two others, which will be announced or not as I know more).<br/>
<br/>
If you think you might possibly want to go to Albuquerque between Christmas and New Year&#39;s, please subscribe to this blog so you&#39;ll know what&#39;s up!<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://albuquerqueallive.blogspot.com">http://albuquerqueallive.blogspot.com</a><br/>
<br/>
I hope some who have been here before will be back, and some who haven&#39;t been will come and see.  The hotel is nice (and NOT expensive—nice rooms about $50 a night for our conference rate).  It&#39;s peaceful and roomy and fun.<br/>
<br/>
Too much travel has kicked my butt in the past few years.  I want to stay home and do the Albuquerque gatherings every December, rather than try to do remote &quot;Always Learning Live&quot; events.  As long as this wonderful site is available to us at these rates, I should stay and invite people to come to see me here.  <br/>
<br/>
Albuquerque is beautiful, and the site is less than two miles, straight shot from &quot;The A-1 Car Wash&quot; from Breaking Bad.  Seriously.   <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Both are right off Eubank Blvd.   And Walt&#39;s house, if you&#39;re driving that far anyway, is just another mile or so, a few blocks off Eubank and Comanche.<br/>
<br/>
(End of Breaking Bad moment)<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes to all of you whether you can come to hear me and some bright, happy unschoolers in Maine or New Mexico or not. :-)   Thanks for thinking about it, even for a moment here. :-)<br/>

Usually we are in Tasmania with my husbands family every Christmas, but this year we are in town (CA) so it actually something I can consider this year. <br><br>Both my sons though had a question concerning the gaming room. They asked if it was a room for playing games, or a room for people who were going to be &quot;gaming&quot;, as in, having a good wi-fi&nbsp; connection.&nbsp; <br><br>I was going to write privately, but thought maybe some other families had the same question. <br><br>Hoping we can attend this year.<br><br>Rachael</div>
