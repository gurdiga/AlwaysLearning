&lt;&lt;  I guess some kids only know screaming or spanking.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some kids don&#39;t know that AND they seem not to know someone just talking to <br/>
them like a person and telling them calmly that spitting is a bit like peeing <br/>
on someone, and if they did it as an adult they could go to jail or have to <br/>
pay money, that it&#39;s that bad.  Maybe nobody&#39;s ever talked to them calmly <br/>
about germs, or paid enough direct and sweet attention to them to notice <br/>
their quirks and advise them on better tactics.<br/>
<br/>
And when I see a child like that, I wonder if it&#39;s just that the mom is <br/>
oblivious because she herself doesn&#39;t have social awareness, and so she can&#39;t <br/>
really teach and pass it down to her kids.  <br/>
<br/>
So sometimes I&#39;ll just deal with other people&#39;s kids, when they&#39;re in my <br/>
space--not scream at them, but talk to them like I would an adult who was <br/>
doing something in my house or my car or at my table at a restaurant and I <br/>
had good reason to want them not to do it right then or there or in that <br/>
fashion to or in front of my kids.<br/>
<br/>
I did say to a visiting kid the other day &quot;Try not to be a prick.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He said brightly, &quot;Okay.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was tired of him needling, needling, bugging, irritating (which is kind of <br/>
his way to interact with other kids) and then when we were on the way out to <br/>
deliver boys somewhere, he put snow on the shyest and poorest and <br/>
least-warmly dressed of any of them.  On the least likely to defend himself.  <br/>
And the place they were going wasn&#39;t a really warm place.  <br/>
<br/>
So in exchange for my having had him in the house for 24 hours with his <br/>
hyperness, lack of need to sleep (he&#39;s like me--six hours or seven, and going <br/>
strong again, while the other boys are still sleeping), constant teasing and <br/>
commentary,  he had to endure my analysis of it in a stressful moment.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re still friends.  He really DOES want to interact in a good way, he&#39;s <br/>
just jittery, zippy, and used to mean fun.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s also left school to homeschool, a few months ago.  And he&#39;s less &quot;out <br/>
there&quot; already.  He used to be trying to impress school kids and he&#39;d paint <br/>
his nails black, dye his hair green, wear weird necklaces and bracelets and <br/>
t-shirts and attention-getting coats, and so forth.  The last couple of times <br/>
I&#39;ve seen him he was losing the stench of desperation.  He&#39;s getting older <br/>
(one reality) and now he&#39;s trying to fit in with a homeschooled group which <br/>
doesn&#39;t require flash and freakishness.<br/>

The mom said he was just like her brothers when she was growing up.  When I mentioned about the spitting incedent she said the reason I had trouble with him was that I had tattled on him.  He has no respect for people that tattle.  I guess what she was saying was that I needed to figure out a way to deal with him myself.

My kids didn&#39;t even have the concept &quot;tattle,&quot; so if he doesn&#39;t like <br/>
tattlers, his parents told him not to tattle.  They expect him to settle his <br/>
own stuff too?  Seems he is, by spitting.<br/>

<br/>
Well then just tell the kid that.  Say &quot;We don&#39;t like rotten spitting kids, <br/>
so IF you want to hang out with us, or sit by us, act better or be gone.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
At least now you konw the mom didn&#39;t want you to bottle it up and tattle.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You &quot;tattled&quot; on him? Oh, cripes, what an idiot. You didn&#39;t &quot;tattle&quot;, in<br/>
my book - tattling is mentioning some sort of behavior to an adult for<br/>
the sole purpose of getting the kid in trouble. It&#39;s not your job to deal<br/>
with someone&#39;s 4 yr old when she&#39;s right there - she&#39;s blaming the<br/>
victim, you!  For all you knew the kid&#39;s dog died that morning, or his<br/>
uncle Bob had just showed him how much fun spitting was, or spitting was<br/>
his cue that he was overwhelmed and needed some space, or anything. He<br/>
needed some parenting.... and you did ask him to stop once, and he<br/>
didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if she wasn&#39;t right there, then I think you&#39;d be responsible for<br/>
dealing with it... although I don&#39;t think leaving your 4 yr old off<br/>
somewhere unsupervised is a good idea either.. but if this was a 4 yr old<br/>
you were watching for a friend, or something, then you&#39;d have to do<br/>
something. For me, it would be somewhere along the lines of &quot;cut it out,<br/>
I don&#39;t want spit on my chair!&quot; and then finding a place for him to spit<br/>
if he wanted to spit some more, maybe digging a hole in the ground to<br/>
spit in, or finding a toilet. Spitting is kind of fun sometimes....<br/>

I do think, though, that there really aren&#39;t any rotten kids, just kids<br/>
doing rotten things.<br/>

Or tell him to spit in  his own pocket and save it up there. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
This could be a problem.  If an adult spit on me the first time, my response<br/>
would be something along the line &quot;Do that again and I&#39;ll return it down<br/>
your throat with my fist.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You are right about this, especially a 4 year old that needs some guidance.  I have to stop saying that.  Although I don&#39;t know if it is a bad thing for my children to realize they are going to be judged by others on their behavior, good or bad.  It is just the way things are.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, we do talk about what causes children to misbehave and how their parents can help them or in some cases have contributed to the behavior.  The positive side of this is that my children have learned a lot.  The negative side is that I feel like we are criticizing people a lot.  My kids will come in and tell me about different behaviors they have observed and it seems like we talk about this stuff maybe a little too much.  I hope I&#39;m not raising my children to be snobs.<br/>

<br/>
Oh, I think it&#39;s an excellent good thing.  While I do believe in sheltering <br/>
kids from harm, I don&#39;t believe in sheltering them much from others&#39; <br/>
reactions to their own occasional obnoxiousness.  If a kid is angry at one of <br/>
my kids for a good reason, I step on back a couple of steps and let natural <br/>
consequences flow a moment.  Because if they just hear it from me, they won&#39;t <br/>
believe it.  If they hear it from someone with some emotion in the moment, <br/>
it&#39;s real, not just mom-noise.<br/>
<br/>
It hasn&#39;t happened much, but to say &quot;See, Marty?  Kids REALLY don&#39;t like it <br/>
when you do that to them&quot; is stronger than &quot;Marty, maybe if you do that some <br/>
kids might not like it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It has been very rare, but real.  <br/>
<br/>
I remember crying a LOT as a kid, frustrated with social situations.  And <br/>
having to get on the bus when it got there, not being able to talk on the <br/>
phone much, etc. made it harder to solve them, since I wouldn&#39;t see them <br/>
until school, whichever class we had together, or lunch, or whenever, to <br/>
smoothe over problems.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have usually been able to deal with misunderstandings as soon as the <br/>
emotion was gone.  They&#39;re lucky.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Holly&#39;s very analytical about other families and will say some things I <br/>
wasn&#39;t in a position to see or think about until I was much older than she <br/>
is.   There&#39;ve been a couple of dads she was afraid of because they yelled or <br/>
spanked, but she comes and talks to me and tells me what she thinks, why she <br/>
thinks things turned out as they did, what she would have done different if <br/>
she were the kid, or the dad, what she thinks the mom could have done, etc.  <br/>
It&#39;s a good lab for her.  <br/>
<br/>
In one family, she used to want to come home as soon as the dad got home, <br/>
because the dynamics changed so much.  Holly was seven.  Now she&#39;s ten, and <br/>
can stay overnight with the dad there.  Partly she&#39;s older, partly she knows <br/>
the dad better, and partly the dad&#39;s not as reactionary as he used to be!  I <br/>
can&#39;t help but think that having Holly there could have made the situation <br/>
better.  When he has other kids&#39; behavior to compare to he knows more.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I suppose my 3 yr old is a &quot;rotten kid&quot;  at times - but I see a wonderful,<br/>
energetic, caring person who doesn&#39;t know how to manage some feelings yet<br/>
without hitting or pulling hair or screaming loudly enough to practically<br/>
pierce an eardrum.  She used to bite....it didn&#39;t last long.  In fact,  all<br/>
my children were biters at some point.   Jenna&#39;s now in a phase where she<br/>
spits at her siblings when she&#39;a angry (or tries to....it doesn&#39;y actually<br/>
leave her mouth).  I figure she&#39;s young and will outgrow this.  I usually<br/>
ask her to do something else..with me if possible,  in order to pull her out<br/>
of the situation.  So far she hasn&#39;t spit at anyone outside our home,   but<br/>
it could happen;  she doesn&#39;t always show signs of building up to these<br/>
&#39;outbursts&#39;.<br/>
    Too bad the mom could not have intervened by picking up the child and<br/>
speaking with him privately....and wiping the mess plus apologize to you and<br/>
your dd.  At least she has some insight if she thinks the 2nd one was a<br/>
reaction to &#39;tattling&#39;.....wonder if she&#39;ll grow from there.<br/>
