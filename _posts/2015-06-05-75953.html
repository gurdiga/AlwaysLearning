<br/>
As they&#39;re too young for school in California, you are doing a different sort of parenting, but it&#39;s not yet unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
The problem with India is that when the grandparents put pressure, there&#39;s not much way out.  At least if there&#39;s a law about school, there can be an exception to that law.  And now that you&#39;re in California, the exception is to create a private school.  So that might be easier for Indian grandparents than some other places&#39; laws and terminology.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My wife is not open the the idea of complete freedom to the kids.-=-<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no such thing, so change your wording.<br/>
http://sandradodd.com/freedom<br/>
&quot;Freedom&quot; isn&#39;t a good model.  Options.  Choices.  Those can work better.<br/>
<br/>
-=-friday - entertainment day... will explain. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Will waste your time and ours, so don&#39;t bother.<br/>
<br/>
Library, park, swim/shop/zoo/museum, none of those takes all day.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I really don&#39;t know if I am doing the best for them. My time and their time. Only attribute I can measure is the happiness. -=-<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t know if you&#39;re doing the best for them, either.  There is not school in the world that is &quot;doing the best&quot; for every student attending there.<br/>
<br/>
-=-parents with young kids please help me. what do you guys do everyday?  -=-<br/>
<br/>
Think carefully before asking questions here. :-)<br/>
Those who don&#39;t have young kids now had young kids some years back.  The people with children your age don&#39;t know more than you do.  If they tell you what they&#39;re doing, what you don&#39;t know is what they will regret in five years.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some stories of people&#39;s days:<br/>

<br/>
-=-TV and ipad - Friday is iPad day. (my son says &#39;I am excited about tomorrow&#39; on every Thursday) we set time to friday just to make sure they don&#39;t need to fall back on to iPad everyday when they are bored.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
Which day is books day?<br/>
<br/>
Which day is cloth day?<br/>
<br/>
I hope one of these days coming up is the day when you stop arbitrarily depriving your children.<br/>

<br/>
-=-Fear of addiction ... to the medium.. does such a thing exist ? -=-<br/>
<br/>
Do you hope people here will say &quot;yes, it exists—you&#39;re right to make your children wait excitedly for days&quot;?<br/>
Or do you hope people will say you&#39;re wrong?<br/>
It won&#39;t matter if five people or five hundred people disagree with you or agree.  You should look at your children directly, decide what it is you want from life, learn about what kind of damage can be done (to relationships, trust, learning) and make more mindful, direct, clear decisions.<br/>

Why do you want advice from parents with young kids, and beginners?<br/>
<br/>
For doing better, here are some starting places:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-226014946"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; *** 1. I really don&#39;t know if I am doing the best for them. My time and their<br/>
&gt; time. Only attribute I can measure is the happiness.***<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Happiness is good! <br/>
<br/>
There are some thoughts here about happiness and prioritising it that<br/>
you might find useful:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/priorities">http://sandradodd.com/priorities</a><br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; *** Any suggestions here ? parents with young kids please help me. what do you<br/>
&gt; guys do everyday? ***<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have a 3 yr old. Most of the time we do whatever has his interest at<br/>
that time. (Currently popular: playdough and modelling clay, various<br/>
iPad apps, YouTube videos about the planets, playing at<br/>
mama-and-baby-animals, and a whole bunch of other things.) <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I&#39;ll suggest something I think he might like (visit a friend,<br/>
bike ride, go to the Science Museum, watch a particular programme, a<br/>
cool new app), or give him something I&#39;ve found or ordered that I<br/>
thought he might enjoy (play food, a big box of new Playdoh, cool<br/>
stickers). Sometimes I&#39;m right, occasionally I&#39;m not :) <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes we have errands to run. Sometimes I have to find creative ways<br/>
to make that more fun. Sometimes we go to playgroups or swimming or<br/>
whatever. Some things happen on certain days -- e.g. the Monday<br/>
playgroup only happens every other Monday -- and some things fit well on<br/>
certain days. But that doesn&#39;t mean that we *have* to go to Monday<br/>
playgroup if Leon really just wants to stay home that day. <br/>
<br/>
You can follow your kids&#39; interests and wishes. (Though obviously with<br/>
two that&#39;s harder than just one -- you need to get more creative meeting<br/>
everyone&#39;s needs!)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; *** 2. TV and ipad - Friday is iPad day. (my son says &#39;I am excited about<br/>
&gt; tomorrow&#39; on every Thursday) we set time to friday just to make sure they<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t need to fall back on to iPad everyday when they are bored.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Fear of addiction ... to the medium.. does such a thing exist ?***<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Does your fear exist? I guess it does.<br/>
<br/>
Does iPad addiction exist? Nope. Not in healthy happy kids. Maybe in<br/>
unhappy kids who have a need to escape. But unschooled kids are free to<br/>
choose what they *want* to do when they want to do it -- assuming you<br/>
don&#39;t screw that up by, say, telling them they can only do something at<br/>
a particular time.<br/>
<br/>
iPads are amazing tools. There is SO MUCH you can do with an iPad. So<br/>
much to learn, so much fun to have. Why would you restrict that? Your<br/>
son looks forward so much to Fridays -- wouldn&#39;t it be better if he<br/>
looked forward just as much to *every* day? <br/>
<br/>
You say &quot;falling back on iPad when they&#39;re bored&quot;. Why is that bad? If<br/>
whatever they&#39;re doing on the iPad is more fun than everything else<br/>
around them, why shouldn&#39;t they do the fun thing? When it&#39;s not fun --<br/>
when building Lego or chasing each other round the garden or whatever is<br/>
more fun -- then they&#39;ll do that instead. <br/>
<br/>
If you think they&#39;re doing *anything* (not just something that happens<br/>
to be on the iPad -- and as above, that covers a lot of things!) because<br/>
they lack other options, then it&#39;s your job to provide other fun things.<br/>
Lay out the train tracks, or suggest a game that they love (Leon will<br/>
drop pretty much anything to play acrobatics with me; unfortunately<br/>
that&#39;s time-limited by my stamina :) ) or start building something<br/>
yourself. (And then don&#39;t be hurt or sad if they don&#39;t want to do that.<br/>
They have choices, and they&#39;re choosing what they want! That&#39;s good!)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; *** 3. Reading  - My son can read the few words and definitely tries when he<br/>
&gt; wants to. however he/we were told not to do this and follow the<br/>
&gt; instructions from the teacher. (pre-school before April.)  when I ask him<br/>
&gt; to try he responds &#39;i can do it when I am 5 or 7 etc&#39;***<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is that something he&#39;s heard from someone else? You could gently reply<br/>
with &quot;you can do it whenever you&#39;re ready&quot; -- but maybe stop asking him<br/>
to try, and wait for him to want to try. He&#39;s been told he shouldn&#39;t<br/>
try; it may take a while before he&#39;s comfortable to try again. <br/>
