<div id="ygrps-yiv-1190478188"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Oh, these are good!  <br/>
&gt;A lot of really good ones, and I liked &quot;If I hadn&#39;t<br/>

One of my favorite little poems:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If you do not believe in Dragons,<br/>
It is curiously true,<br/>
That the Dragons you disparage,<br/>
Chose to not believe in you.&quot;<br/>

The Dragons Are Singing Tonight<br/>
