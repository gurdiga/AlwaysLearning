<div id="ygrps-yiv-2110435805">Really thank you so much for your inclination to help other unschoolers, i am new but i know that unschooling is the only way to go for my children and i .  my son will be 4 and my daughter is only 1 1/2 but i have gotten either negative feed back on &quot;home schooling&quot; ( i have not had the guts to tell any one that is unsupportive about unschooling)  or people just sort of act like it will be somthing i try but wont follow through with, thankfully i do know a handfull of people in my community that unschool and i am going to be turning to them alot in the near future now that i am expected to put my son in pre-school next year.  I posted here just once so far i think to introduce myself, but i plan on coming back here as often as possible now that i have my new computer.  My decision to unschool and just have my children home gets to be a very emotional decision for me because as a 2nd grader in public school i was sexually and actually pretty<br/>
 violently assaulted by a 4th grader, I must have been in complete shock and hard to handle in the classroom because my teacher took to physically abusing me ( picking me up off the floor by the shoulders and shaking me violently on a daily basis )  I feel that is unfortunate that i have to simultaniously heal from that negative experience while trying to be a mother to my two beautifull children, i get caught up in some depression sometimes.  But i know that brighter days are ahead, especially because i am choosing to unschool.  I am so thank full to unschooling support groups and i gravitated to this one in particular and have quotes printed out all over my house from Allways learning.<br/>

That&#39;s a good place to be, though, because there&#39;s less friction.   <br/>
People used to say &quot;Are you still homeschooling Kirby?&quot; (my oldest,  <br/>
when he was six, and seven, and eight) and I would say &quot;It&#39;s still  <br/>
working out!&quot;   Or if the question was &quot;How long are you going to  <br/>
homeschool Kirby?&quot; I&#39;d say as long as it was working out as well as it  <br/>
was.  Or if they were just plainly hoping I&#39;d put him in school, I&#39;d  <br/>
say &quot;If this stops working, the school is right there.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It made the other people feel good.<br/>
It also gave me an out--not that I felt that I needed one, but I&#39;ve  <br/>
seen a dozen families over the years in which the mom made way more  <br/>
than her share of noise about how her kids would NEVER go to school,  <br/>
they would ALWAYS be home, and one way or another the kids ended up in  <br/>
school.  So add embarrassment and frustration to their equation, and  <br/>
the awareness of other families where the mom was making less noise  <br/>
and doing more cool stuff with the kids.<br/>
<br/>

that negative experience while trying to be a mother to my two  <br/>
beautifull children, i get caught up in some depression sometimes.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
There are self-help groups that won&#39;t cost money, or you should go to  <br/>
a counsellor if the depression isn&#39;t manageable.   As it affects the  <br/>
children, don&#39;t put off getting help.  You don&#39;t want your school to  <br/>
mess up their lives too.<br/>
<br/>
One way to heal is to imagine your childhood life if you had had  <br/>
choices (and then give your kids choices) and more attention (and then  <br/>
give them attention) and if people had cared more and listened.  Each  <br/>
time you&#39;re attentive and compassionate, imagine how it would have  <br/>
felt to your own childhood self if people had done those tiny, sweet  <br/>
things for you.  And don&#39;t wallow in it or get angry about it. Use it  <br/>
as a healing balm for your soul.<br/>

Those all have links to other probably-useful things  about self- <br/>
healing and being the parent you would have liked to have had, and  <br/>
being the parent your children need you to be.<br/>
