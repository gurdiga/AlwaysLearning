<div id="ygrps-yiv-793214021">I&#39;d like to add my two cents about our concerns about the Alternative<br/>
Education Programs in Washington State.<br/>
<br/>
As Nichoel stated, these programs are getting people in their<br/>
programs by telling them they will be homeschooling, but once<br/>
enrolled in the program, by statute they are not &quot;homeschooling&quot;.<br/>
They are in a public school program.  We are concerned about the<br/>
disctinction because of accountability.  The people in these programs<br/>
are held up as examples of homeschooling.  These people don&#39;t mind<br/>
being supervised, being tested etc.  The people are told they must <br/>
take the WASL - homeschoolers are not required to take the WASL test  <br/>
and public schooled children can opt out of it as well - but they <br/>
aren&#39;t told this.  So we are concerned that they are not being given <br/>
the facts as outlined in the statutes of the state.  We don&#39;t object <br/>
to their choice but we are concerned about how this &quot;model&quot; of <br/>
homeschooling can affect our right to homeschool in the future. One<br/>
of the reasons I homeschool my children is because I don&#39;t believe I<br/>
need to be guided and supervised and I don&#39;t believe that testing is <br/>
the best way to evaluate how much my children are learning.  So when<br/>
these programs are used as models of homeschooling - with supervision <br/>
and testing  - and the public sees this &quot;model&quot; of supervision and <br/>
accountability as the new wave in the homeschooling community, we are <br/>
concerned that the laws will be changed to reflect the &quot;model&quot; as the <br/>
only way to legally homeschool in this state. Personally, I am <br/>
comfortable with the homeschooling laws as they are.  And I believe <br/>
that it is every parent&#39;s right to choose how their children are <br/>
educated, be it public, private, AEP or homeschooling. We are not <br/>
trying to be critical of parents choices, nor are we trying to be <br/>
divisive.  Many of us are concerned about changes to our laws based<br/>
on the trends we are seeing of homeschoolers flocking to these <br/>
programs - and under false pretenses. Then the powers that be see this <br/>
trend, and in their concern that all children be given a quality <br/>
education and their belief that the state has an obligation to make <br/>
sure homeschooled children are getting that quality education, they <br/>
then work to tighten the reins on all of us - for the public good of <br/>
course. And they are using the AEPs as examples of successful <br/>
homeschooling with accountability.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my rant - did I make my concerns clear?<br/>
