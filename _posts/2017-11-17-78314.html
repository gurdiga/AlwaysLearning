<div id="ygrps-yiv-68619218">I’m working on an article for the German magazine Unerzogen (which probably has an umlaut or something in there somewhere, but it’s not in my head), and there’s something I want to use, but it won’t work as it is.<br/>

&quot;Respect&quot; is not a light thing.  It&#39;s not easy to respect your child, when it&#39;s new to you.  There will be people encouraging you to see your child as &quot;just a kid,&quot; and &quot;only a child.&quot;  Think of adults you respect, and think of them as ten years old, four years old, two, newborn.  They were those people from birth.  There was a newborn Mohandas Gandhi; a four-year-old Abraham Lincoln; an eight-year-old Oprah Winfrey, a twelve-year-old Winston Churchill. <br/>
________<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They might care about Gandhi, but those other three, probably  not.<br/>
<br/>
What are some possibilities?<br/>
<br/>
It should be four people who are respected and not all in the same field or in the same way, and people from different time periods (or not all from the same days, anyway).<br/>
<br/>
The same list might not even work in Austalia or Canada or the UK or India so it’s not just language.  But I’m not doing a full range of particulars, just might want to use it to be translated into German, with examples that would work in and around Germany.<br/>
<br/>
“It won’t work” might end up being the answer, but I thought it might be a fun puzzle for some of you. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1788375760"><html><head></head>A friend of mine is German and she often refers to Einstein with German pride. I’ve read so much about him. I would have loved to interview him at 8-12. He still didn’t have appreciation for his violin’s necessity at this point, but I”d love to hear what he thought of it. I always think of a young 5-7 Beethoven and a teenage Kepler(familial witchcraft accusations) for their German roots. Possibly Nietzsche too at 12? Wow! I’d love to ask him questions.&nbsp;<div class="ygrps-yiv-1788375760"><br class="ygrps-yiv-1788375760"></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1788375760">Hope that helps.</div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1788375760"><br class="ygrps-yiv-1788375760"><div><blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote type="cite" class="ygrps-yiv-1788375760"><div class="ygrps-yiv-1788375760">On Nov 17, 2017, at 5:22 PM, Tress Miles <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:milesdt@..." class="ygrps-yiv-1788375760">milesdt@...</a> [AlwaysLearning] &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com" class="ygrps-yiv-1788375760">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; wrote:</div><br class="ygrps-yiv-1788375760Apple-interchange-newline"><div class="ygrps-yiv-1788375760"><div id="ygrps-yiv-1788375760ygrp-mlmsg" style="font-size:13px;font-family:Arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);" class="ygrps-yiv-1788375760"><div id="ygrps-yiv-1788375760ygrp-msg" style="line-height:1.22em;" class="ygrps-yiv-1788375760"><div id="ygrps-yiv-1788375760ygrp-text" style="line-height:1.22em;font-family:Georgia;" class="ygrps-yiv-1788375760"><div style="line-height:1.22em;margin:0px 0px 1em;" class="ygrps-yiv-1788375760"><br class="ygrps-yiv-1788375760webkit-block-placeholder"></div><div dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.22em;" class="ygrps-yiv-1788375760">German&nbsp; athletes:&nbsp; Katarina Witt, Boris Becker</div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1788375760gmail_extra" style="line-height:1.22em;"><br style="line-height:1.22em;" class="ygrps-yiv-1788375760"><div class="ygrps-yiv-1788375760gmail_quote" style="line-height:1.22em;">On Fri, Nov 17, 2017 at 5:18 PM, Sandra Dodd<span class="ygrps-yiv-1788375760Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Sandra@..." style="line-height:1.22em;" class="ygrps-yiv-1788375760">Sandra@...</a><span class="ygrps-yiv-1788375760Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>[AlwaysLearning]<span class="ygrps-yiv-1788375760Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><span dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.22em;" class="ygrps-yiv-1788375760">&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com" style="line-height:1.22em;" class="ygrps-yiv-1788375760">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;</span><span class="ygrps-yiv-1788375760Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>wrote:<br style="line-height:1.22em;" class="ygrps-yiv-1788375760"><blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-1788375760gmail_quote" style="margin:0px 0px 0px 4px;line-height:1.22em;border-left-width:1px;border-left-style:solid;border-left-color:rgb(204, 204, 204);"><u style="line-height:1.22em;" class="ygrps-yiv-1788375760"></u><div style="line-height:1.22em;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);" class="ygrps-yiv-1788375760"><span style="line-height:1.22em;" class="ygrps-yiv-1788375760">&nbsp;</span><div id="ygrps-yiv-1788375760m_4459738807923682377ygrp-mlmsg" style="line-height:1.22em;" class="ygrps-yiv-1788375760"><div id="ygrps-yiv-1788375760m_4459738807923682377ygrp-msg" style="line-height:1.22em;" class="ygrps-yiv-1788375760"><div id="ygrps-yiv-1788375760m_4459738807923682377ygrp-text" style="line-height:1.22em;" class="ygrps-yiv-1788375760"><p style="line-height:1.22em;margin:0px 0px 1em;" class="ygrps-yiv-1788375760">-=-Queen Elizabeth II ? -=-<br style="line-height:1.22em;" class="ygrps-yiv-1788375760"><br style="line-height:1.22em;" class="ygrps-yiv-1788375760">Even when she was little, she was of that royal family, though.<span class="ygrps-yiv-1788375760Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br style="line-height:1.22em;" class="ygrps-yiv-1788375760">They didn’t expect her dad to become king, but still… :-)<br style="line-height:1.22em;" class="ygrps-yiv-1788375760"><br style="line-height:1.22em;" class="ygrps-yiv-1788375760">What about a football player Germans like?
