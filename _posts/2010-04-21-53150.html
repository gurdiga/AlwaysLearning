<div id="ygrps-yiv-1989103217">Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
It recently became clear to me that we are experiencing some sibling <br/>
rivalry here.  Until now, my daughter Temima&#39;s (nearly 4 years old) <br/>
problems were focused on me - on my choosing between her and the baby.  <br/>
We did work through that, found peaceful ways, mostly, to get everyone&#39;s <br/>
needs met, mostly (there were a lot of missed naps for the baby <br/>
involved, but I think he&#39;s ok &lt;grin&gt;).  I think that recently her <br/>
feelings have morphed into a more direct sort of sibling rivalry.  Her <br/>
brother is 14 months old, and is fast becoming a toddler.  So much more <br/>
potential for their play (and I see how she loves to help him learn and <br/>
&#39;teach&#39; him new things).   But she is also much more inclined to focus <br/>
on how he interferes with what she wants and make issue of things that <br/>
are difficult to change (the &#39;rivalry&#39;, I think).  For example, she <br/>
wants to eat on the floor, or sitting on the sofa, or in other easy to <br/>
reach places when the baby is crawling around.  He goes after her food, <br/>
and she kicks, screams and is very emotional.  I try to minimize the <br/>
occurances of this by feeding him in his high chair, or distracting him <br/>
and playing with him while she eats.  I also try to encourage her to <br/>
find, and offer her options, for ways/places to eat where he can&#39;t grab <br/>
(since I can&#39;t keep him occupied indefinitely, and she doesn&#39;t want me <br/>
to leave the room with him), but she refuses all of those.  It feels <br/>
like she WANTS to create that conflict, to prove a point (or what the 3 <br/>
year old version of proving the point is).  I guess the &#39;point&#39; is that <br/>
he shouldn&#39;t dictate where she eats?  In any case, that is one example.  <br/>
I would appreciate some advice or reading material.  I&#39;ve got Siblings <br/>
without Rivalry on hold at the library, and I&#39;ve read Sandra&#39;s pages (or <br/>
the ones I could find), but they seemed to be about older examples.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Shira</div>

You wouldn&#39;t have to occupy him indefinitely, just until she&#39;s through  <br/>
eating.<br/>
<br/>
We used to have an aluminum-frame backback for a baby, like for  <br/>
hikers, and all my kids spent a lot of happy time up there.  I would  <br/>
walk babies to sleep sometimes, outside in the cool air.  I would put  <br/>
a baby in the back to do things with the others.<br/>
<br/>
I remember the resentment about my sister&#39;s arrival when I was  <br/>
little.  My mom liked her better in every way (not just my opinion; it  <br/>
lasted forever) and she was a huge imposition on my place in the  <br/>
universe.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-936542975">Ok, you&#39;re right, its not &#39;indefinitely&#39;!  Thanks for catching that.  <br/>
She does eat extremely slowly, with tiny bites.  I think I&#39;m taking it <br/>
too personally. <br/>
<br/>
I have lots of baby carriers, thanks for the reminder.  I use them all <br/>
the time, I just hadn&#39;t thought of it for this.  I think I was worried <br/>
that if I put him on my back then I&#39;d be choosing him again... since she <br/>
wants me to sit with her and be with her while she eats, but he wants me <br/>
moving around and doing things if he&#39;s on my back.  Maybe she&#39;ll let me <br/>
do laundry or dishes next time, I&#39;ll try.<br/>

Its good to hear that perspective, the words she might use but isn&#39;t.  <br/>
I&#39;m an eldest too, but I don&#39;t remember those feelings.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Maybe ask her what would help, and put that as one of the options if  <br/>
she doesn&#39;t have an immediate, workable idea.  My kids had good ideas  <br/>
lots of times that I hadn&#39;t thought of.<br/>
