<div id="ygrps-yiv-1926859751">I got this question from someone on a local homeschooling list:<br/>
<br/>
 (it&#39;s best to use a wide screen)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Just wondering how many of you guys have high schoolers and if so how do you <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; unschool them? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have a fourteen-year old who is unschooled; he&#39;d be in 9th if he were in <br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
Some of his main interests since we pulled him out of school have included:<br/>
<br/>
Interests                                                      &quot;Subjects&quot; <br/>

sex (he&#39;s 14!)                    biology/physiology/sex ed/inter-& <br/>
intra-personal skills<br/>
screenplay-writing              literature/composition/art/language <br/>
arts(grammar/spelling/idioms/set-up)<br/>
film-making                       art/composition/critical <br/>
analysis/acting/directing/producing<br/>
scrapbooking                    art/composition/educationese/storytelling/<br/>
education                          philosophy/history/psychology<br/>
<br/>
If he were here, he could probably give me a few other interests. His travel <br/>
has included trips to Germany (at 11, by himself) to Australia (at 13, with <br/>
People To People) and to Washington state (at 14, with Wilderness Ventures). <br/>
Not to mention family trips.<br/>
<br/>
We go WITH his interests, not against them. We discuss A LOT. He questions A <br/>
LOT. And we encourage that.<br/>
<br/>
Deschooling from Heathwood Hall was tough. We allowed him a lot of time to <br/>
heal. He&#39;s STILL healing, but he&#39;s happy and content with Who He Is and now <br/>
craves learning again.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about being your child&#39;s partner in education, not his <br/>
adversary.<br/>

There are websites composed by adult unschoolers I can find for you if you&#39;re <br/>
interested.<br/>
