<div id="ygrps-yiv-477814555">&lt;&lt; Is there a brain structure or function which governs &quot;God&quot;?  If a person <br/>
who is<br/>
religious can become an atheist because of depression, does it mean that<br/>
faith, or the perception of God, or spirituality, is controlled by some<br/>
function of the brain, which depression interrupts?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If the answer to any of that is &quot;yes,&quot; does it mean that God does not <br/>
exist,<br/>
that our perceptions are delusions which plague some but not others, or does<br/>
it mean he/she/it *does* exist, and has created these structures or<br/>
functions in order to have contact with us?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;My religion&#39;s hagiography is replete with saints whose visions could be <br/>
just<br/>
as easily described as hallucinations; were they just nuts, or can severe<br/>
fasting account for them?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Wow... What fascinating questions!  You&#39;ve reminded me of a book a friend <br/>
recommended to me recently.  I&#39;m going to try to borrow it today.  It&#39;s <br/>
called &quot;Lying Awake&quot; by Mark Salzman.  The blurb on Amazon says the book <br/>
&quot;...probes the nature of spiritual illumination.&quot;  It&#39;s about a middle-aged <br/>
cloistered nun in LA who is languishing in a spiritual drought.  That is <br/>
until she begins receiving intense, rapturous mystical visions.  <br/>
Unfortunately, they&#39;re accompanied by excruciating headaches and blacking <br/>
out.  She learns she has a form of epilepsy that commonly brings this type <br/>
of experience about.  Now she&#39;s faced with the decision of whether ot go <br/>
ahead with surgery and risk obliterating her spiritual life and her art, or <br/>
&quot;...cling to a state of grace that may actually be a delsuion ignited by an <br/>
electrochemical imbalance.  At the bottom there lurks a profound meditation <br/>
on the mystery of artistic inspiration.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Thought some others may be interested in checking this out as well.<br/>
