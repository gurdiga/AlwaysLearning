<div id="ygrps-yiv-2083244119">Hmmm, I have a stigmatism, can never make those stupid<br/>
3-D things work, AND have gotten carsick all my life. <br/>
Now I usually drive, as opposed to being a passenger. <br/>
That helps a lot.  I get sick more when the weather<br/>
stormy and there are pressure changes, and on windy<br/>
roads, or if I look away from the road while we are<br/>
turning.  Some people&#39;s driving is worse for me than<br/>
others.  Thankfully my husband&#39;s driving doesn&#39;t make<br/>
me sick very often, but if/when it does he is quick to<br/>
pull over and give me the wheel.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny how most people who are not sufferers of<br/>
it, really do not fathom the depth of the misery that<br/>
is motion sickness.  It&#39;s not an &quot;upset tummy&quot;  but<br/>
all over hot and cold flashes, cold sweats, dizzyness,<br/>
nausea, headache, shakes, weakness, disorientation and<br/>
other things.  It&#39;s a really awful, and can come on<br/>
quickly and last and last and last...  I once got sick<br/>
on a two block car ride to a grovery store and had to<br/>
throw up.  My merciless father used to force us on<br/>
these 12 hours of driving a day marathon vacations<br/>
driving from California to Wash. DC and Florida and<br/>
places like that.  Ugh.<br/>
<br/>
My 5 year old sometimes get&#39;s carsick and we are<br/>
always quick to pull over and walk with him and offer<br/>
him every comfort and sympathy we can.<br/>
