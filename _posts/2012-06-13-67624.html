This is exactly what my oldest, Aidan, does.  But it&#39;s completely<br/>
irritating to his brother, Emory.  Aidan loves to rewind, pause, share, and<br/>
dissect the movie.  He spends a large part of the day looking up actors<br/>
he&#39;s interested in, telling me what else they&#39;ve been in, how many kids<br/>
they have, if they&#39;re writers, producers, and directors too.  I remember<br/>
doing the same thing when I was a kid.  Rewinding bits of movies over and<br/>
over until I knew everything about them.  But my brothers were quite a bit<br/>
older and doing they&#39;re own thing!  Emory enjoys watching movies with<br/>
Aidan, but how can I allow Aidan to explore movies completely, and still<br/>
keep Emory happy?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
Meeting needs doesn&#39;t always mean right when they ask. Sometimes it means shifting to another time so that it&#39;s convenient for others.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What about setting one up to watch a movie all the way through on the tv while the other is watching a different movie on the laptop, with headphones - or vice versa? Or depending on how old Aidan is, can he sit through a whole movie with his brother and Then get to watch it his way? Maybe while you do something else with Emory? Or it might be better to see &quot;watching movies with Aidan&quot; as two desires rolled together rather than one thing and help him meet those two desires separately.<br/>
<br/>
When they were younger, did you go through a stage where one wanted to build things while the other knocked them down? What sorts of solutions helped then?<br/>

My 2 year old is the one who skips around and watches only certain parts of shows repeatedly.  She uses a tablet (a Playbook in our case), so it is a touch screen.<br/>
<br/>
My 5 year old generally prefers other activities to watching tv, but sometimes gets interested in what his little sister is watching.  The way she moves back and forth in the story and never lets it play long before jumping around again drives him crazy.  <br/>
<br/>
When I see this happening, I offer my son the same show on something else - we have a second tablet and a media player, which is like a hard drive for the tv.     <br/>
<br/>
I realize that multiple copies of the same shows/movies might not always be possible, but you might be able to interest one of them in something else eslewhere.  And if your boys have the option of watching things separately in their own ways when they want, then the one who skips around may not mind watching in a more linear way when he and his brother want to watch something together - when the togetherness is more important than the how of the watching. <br/>
<br/>

Mairi.<br/>
