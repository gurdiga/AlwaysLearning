In New Zealand we have a lot of people from Pacific Island cultures and in these cultures it is considered disrespectful to make eye contact in situations involving strangers or those deemed worthy of respect according to cultural norms. Eye contact for these people is therefore often regarded as quite inappropriate and to request it would make them very uncomfortable.  I think considering our children as guests is a good guide on how to interact with our children.<br/>
