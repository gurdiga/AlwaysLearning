<div id="ygrps-yiv-376637358">Especially YOU, Sandra!<br/>
<br/>
All week now I have running in the back of my mind:<br/>
&quot;Soap, soap, soap, soap, soap, soap, soap, soap&quot;<br/>
&quot;What can wash away my sin?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And the worst of it is that there&#39;s nobody here to share it with, because I<br/>
don&#39;t know anyone here that was raised in church. &#39;Course we&#39;re looking to<br/>
change that--get these little heathens &lt;grin--no insult here&gt; into church as<br/>
soon as we move--NEXT MONTH! yay!<br/>
<br/>
Now my mind, perfectly unbidden, is coming up with other parodies of sacred<br/>
music...and it&#39;s *All YOUR FAULT!* (collectively, remembering also the &quot;under<br/>
the sheets&quot; thread and others)<br/>
<br/>
:-) Diane</div>
