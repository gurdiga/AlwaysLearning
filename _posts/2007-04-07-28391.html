<div id="ygrps-yiv-1771502719">I&#39;ve been asked by Steve Cooperman and Peter Kowalke to pass this on  <br/>
to my lists, and so here it is.  There&#39;s quite a bit to read at their  <br/>
website.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
New Web Magazine for Self-Directed Learners of All Ages<br/>
<br/>
We are excited to announce the launch of a new bimonthly web magazine  <br/>
for self-directed learners of all ages—grown unschoolers, teenage  <br/>
unschoolers, parents unschooling themselves while they homeschool  <br/>
their kids, and adults who follow their inner compass and never stop  <br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
Sponge Magazine is a community and lifestyle magazine for people who  <br/>
are curious about the world around them and learning all the time. It  <br/>
is the hub of an interconnected web of self-directed learners eager  <br/>
to share experiences, resources, advice, inspiration, encouragement,  <br/>
and new ideas to learning problems.<br/>
<br/>
Great resources currently exist for homeschoolers/unschoolers and  <br/>
their parents, but there is nothing for homeschoolers/unschoolers  <br/>
beyond high school age. Sponge Magazine fills the void for  <br/>
unschooling adults, anyone who understands that self-directed  <br/>
learning is more than an educational practice–it&#39;s a lifestyle based  <br/>
on curiosity, self-empowerment and inner truth.<br/>
<br/>
Sponge Magazine will include features and columns covering a wide  <br/>
range of topics, including:<br/>
Making the transition from childhood to adulthood as a self-directed  <br/>
learner<br/>
Dealing with the struggle between self-direction and mainstream  <br/>
values/lifestyle<br/>
Life as a self-directed learner<br/>
Travel opportunities well-suited for self-directed learners<br/>
Mainstream news interpreted from the self-directed learner perspective<br/>
Profiles of famous self-directed learners<br/>
Readers sharing a new idea, lifestyle, experience, discovery or area  <br/>
of interest that gets them totally psyched<br/>
And much more<br/>
Here are some sample article titles:<br/>
“Full-Time Work: Is It Necessary?”<br/>
“Discovering a Kinesthetic Learning Style”<br/>
“Starting a Dotcom”<br/>
“I&#39;m a Cook at Moosewoods”<br/>
“Berkana Learning Journey to Mexico”<br/>
<br/>
Sponge Magazine was co-founded by Peter Kowalke. A lifelong  <br/>
unschooler, Peter is a columnist for Life Learning Magazine and Home  <br/>
Educator&#39;s Family Times, and a former columnist for Home Education  <br/>
Magazine. Peter was communications director at the Clonlara School.  <br/>
He is the producer of Grown Without Schooling, a documentary about  <br/>
grown homeschoolers, and he&#39;s a regular speaker at homeschooling  <br/>
conferences.<br/>
<br/>
Sponge Magazine officially debuts in October, but we’re soft- <br/>
