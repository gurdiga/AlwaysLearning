<div id="ygrps-yiv-885584533">I think if a person is willing to discuss an<br/>
issue, then it&#39;s worth it to express your<br/>
opinion as long as there is no animosity.<br/>
Families have lost contact over less.<br/>
<br/>
I know I am not the same parent that I<br/>
thought I would be.  When I gave birth I was<br/>
only going to nurse 1 year, would NEVER sleep<br/>
with my child, and felt time out was good.  I<br/>
felt strongly that it was wrong to nurse<br/>
longer than 18 months or so.  I can give you<br/>
other examples, but those are the ones that<br/>
come to my mind.  Through people challenging<br/>
my ideas, I have changed.   For the better, I<br/>
think.<br/>

&lt;&lt; &gt; If they<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; refuse to really hear you, then you waste your breath.<br/>
 &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I used to think that, but too many times someone has come back and said &quot;I <br/>
totally thought you were wrong ten years ago, but then this&#39;n&#39;that happened, <br/>
and I remembered what you said...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes information is &quot;timed release&quot; or it waits for a catalyst to stir <br/>
it back up.<br/>
<br/>
So now I give people information and cautions whether they think they need or <br/>
want it or not, and even if they never change I have the satisfaction of <br/>
knowing it&#39;s not for my own lack of trying. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-312675320">I think when you learn that everything isn&#39;t as serious as you think <br/>
at that moment then you can gain perspective and not use physical <br/>
force.  I believe in peaceful or positive parenting and when you have <br/>
control of yourself you are teaching your children something that they <br/>
will keep with them for a life time Parenting doesn&#39;t have to be a <br/>
leader follower situation It can be of to friend with one as the guide <br/>
not leader<br/>
Glad I finilly had something to add to this group I have been reading <br/>
for a couple of months now <br/>
