where I saw a half full glass of lemonade.  I smiled.  At one time I<br/>
would&#39;ve looked out and saw that same image and thought someone left<br/>
that out there, it needs to be picked up...  But, today I<br/>
thought-someone enjoyed lemonade (made by herself) out in the warm<br/>
sunshine.  Change feels good.<br/>

unschooling works or doesn&#39;t work.  If you can&#39;t see the learning and<br/>
the beauty, you will have a hard time unschooling.  It seems to work<br/>
best in all those small ways that add up to the bigger picture.</div>

 </span></blockquote>I love these moments.  The other night I was making dinner, and dd (5) <br/>
says &quot;While you&#39;re up, could you get me my gummy worms?&quot;  The old me <br/>
probably would have barked something about how I was in the middle of <br/>
making dinner.  But I said &quot;Okay&quot; in a pleasant way.  She says &quot;Mom, <br/>
what&#39;s right and what&#39;s left?&quot;  So I look around the corner at her and <br/>
say &quot;You&#39;re left hand is holding the remote, you&#39;re right is holding <br/>
your head.&quot;  ds: &quot;Okay, they&#39;re on the left side of my cupboard.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It seems like such a little thing, but I was so happy that I had given <br/>
her the space to figure out something that she was interested in, <br/>
instead of shutting her down with my crankiness.  Change does feel <br/>
good, and I love all these lovely, simple moments we have now.  I love <br/>
that life is more fun now. <br/>

I had one of these moments with my ds 8.  I was busy doing something and<br/>
he asked me &quot;Mom shouldn&#39;t 30 be 20?&quot;  I stopped what I was doing<br/>
because in all my mommy years I&#39;ve learned that in his thought process&#39;s<br/>
he&#39;s most likely correct [;;)] .  I could have just said no 20 is 20 but<br/>
instead I looked at him and asked him in a completely curious way, &quot;what<br/>
do you mean?&quot;  He said well 20 has 21 and so on and 30 has 31 and so on<br/>
but 10 doesn&#39;t.  I thought about it for a few minutes, really trying to<br/>
figure out what he was meaning.  And I said &quot;do you mean like it should<br/>
be tenty one, tenty two and so on?&quot;  He looked at me with wide eyes and<br/>
said &quot;YES!&quot;.  I explained that I didn&#39;t know why they called it 11 and<br/>
12 and so on but that it meant the same thing!  He seemed so pleased to<br/>
have clarity!  And I was so pleased w/myself to have been able to take<br/>
the time to have understood him!!  I felt privileged to have gotten to<br/>
be a part of one of those AH HA moments!!!<br/>

Very cool-such a neat example of how kindness leads to more kindness... I  <br/>
love it!<br/>
