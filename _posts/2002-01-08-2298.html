<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, unfortunatley my son and I learned that awhile ago.  A couple of <br/>
years back on Easters, my son Christopher asked me to warm up one of <br/>
his Easter eggs, just a bit please...Sure hun, here you go one <br/>
slightly warmed hard boiled egg. ....I only warmed it a few seconds <br/>
in the microwave and that is all it took to exploded when he bit into <br/>
it.  OUCH! It still makes me sad to think of it.  It even gave him a  <br/>
small blister on his lip.  All I could think was, Duh! How could I <br/>
have not known?  I seen what a microwave does to a bean or a potato <br/>
that has not been piecred...Sometimes these little facts just slip <br/>
your mind.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunatley he now laughs about the time mom served him that <br/>
exploding egg. AAH! thankfully they are forgiving. :-)<br/>
