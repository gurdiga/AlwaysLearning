<div id="ygrps-yiv-603234463">Hi Jen, I hate to be a bother but after reading your question on this  issue, I have a question for you that I hope whole heartedly you can  answer for me. I have three children b/g twins age 7 and a 3 year old  daughter who I homeschool ( they have never went to school). I love  doing this with all my heart and I love my children and respect them as  well. As a child I was brought up the &quot;normal&quot; way with grounding etc  and said I wanted it to be different for my children however now that I  have them I am having trouble knowing exactly what to do. The issues  are, they fight among each other, my 7 year old daughter is mouthy etc.  They are basically very good kids and everyone comments on how well  behaved etc. they are but I find myself threatening to take things away  etc. and yelling. What comments do you have for me or what suggestes I  quess is what I am asking for. I feel I am doing something wrong if I  feel the need to yell, or take things away or threaten to anyway. Thank <br/>
 you again for listening and as far as your question, I think some of  those parents may welcome your advise because I sure would. (some of  them may actually want your advice and feel funning asking you).<br/>
  Thanks again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-197909542">Hi, I&#39;m pretty new (in Los Angeles, 34, 1 son - 22 months), so I hope you <br/>
don&#39;t mind me posting a response here...<br/>
<br/>
I find that asking questions often helps people begin to realize that maybe <br/>
there are better ways to handle something. I have chosen this route with my <br/>
brother who has been through all sorts of ways to punish his daughters (my <br/>
nieces). One time they were at my home and they spanked one of the girls for <br/>
doing something as innocuous as spilling some sand on my carpet from a <br/>
little zen garden we had on the coffee table (I wish that were the worst <br/>
thing on my carpet!). Since my brothers and I were all physically abused as <br/>
children, I was mortified and after the girls went to bed I couldn&#39;t help <br/>
myself from telling him and his wife how much it bothered me. Of course <br/>
their response was &quot;it was just a light pat - it didn&#39;t hurt her&quot;. I only <br/>
referred to my own experiences at that point and told them how I didn&#39;t <br/>
remember any of the pain from the abuse as a child but that I can never <br/>
forget the embarrassment, emotional pain and sadness at having someone I <br/>
thought was supposed to love and protect me begin hitting me or pulling my <br/>
hair, etc. I just said that even though I would not choose to parent the <br/>
same way, I realized that I didn&#39;t have a right to tell them how to raise <br/>
their children, but that I could not allow that sort of response to occur in <br/>
our home. They agreed and then later I think it sunk in and they turned to <br/>
me and said, &quot;well what are we supposed to do? She never behaves!&quot; My only <br/>
comment was &quot;how is your current approach working? is it effective in <br/>
getting her to &#39;behave&#39;?&quot; Of course, they had no response but later they <br/>
started thinking of other ways to respond to behavior they didn&#39;t like and <br/>
no longer physically punish their children. Maybe soon they&#39;ll begin looking <br/>
at a completely different way of approaching their children rather than from <br/>
any punishment standpoint, but I consider that step a start. When will <br/>
people realize that it just doesn&#39;t work?<br/>
<br/>
Asking open-ended questions about some other hot-button issues <br/>
(bottle-feeding, elective medicated births, etc.) seems to have a disarming <br/>
effect rather than causing a confrontational relationship that might <br/>
alienate you from other parents (I&#39;ve made that mistake before).<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps somewhat!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I got jumped hard by several know-littles on a local homeschooling  <br/>
list that I had created and maintained for years. Someone, thinking  <br/>
it might be cute or helpful, I guess, posted a quote something like  <br/>
raising teens was like trying to nail jello to a tree, and it went on  <br/>
a bit longer, I think.  I responded that it wasn&#39;t that way with  <br/>
unschooled teens; my kids were great.   I got a flurry of criticism  <br/>
for thinking unschooling was all that.  But it IS!  I was telling the  <br/>
simple truth.<br/>
<br/>
So I left that list and am only on unschooling lists now.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s casting pearls before swine, to tell people about unschooling  <br/>
when they&#39;re in the throes of disdainful self-righteousness about  <br/>
what good parents they are when they&#39;re disrespectful of their  <br/>
children, especially when they only turn around and insult you for it.<br/>
<br/>
But on the other hand, you might come up with some stock phrases to  <br/>
put out just a little, and if they&#39;re interested they&#39;ll ask, and if  <br/>
they want to reaffirm their superiority they&#39;ll just roll their eyes  <br/>
or snort.  Just be ready to perceive their little signals about  <br/>
whether they think your statement is an intro or just a mark of your  <br/>
ignorance.<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re SURE they&#39;re bigger and smarter than children, they&#39;d like  <br/>
to think they&#39;re bigger and smarter than people who defend children,  <br/>
so you&#39;ll just put yourself in the kids&#39; category in their mind,  <br/>
maybe, and they will treat you disrespectfully too.<br/>
<br/>
But all that dumped out, I am rarely silent either.  I have said &quot;It  <br/>
doesn&#39;t have to be that way,&quot; or &quot;I know people who used to be that  <br/>
way but changed.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then it&#39;s their move.  Soft face and interested, or eye rolling and  <br/>
snorting?<br/>

It&#39;s linked here, and it might be a webpage others might want to  <br/>

I don&#39;t know the list personally, but I do know they don&#39;t debate  <br/>
spanking but they discuss how to help kids learn how to be without  <br/>
threats or physical punishments.<br/>

<br/>
I am going to butt in here Lori -- I HIGHLY recommend that you read <br/>
Unconditional Parenting by Alfie Kohn.  It will answer all your <br/>
questions!  And, from experience, it totally transformed our <br/>
household (I have B6, G4, B1), it took a few weeks, but things are <br/>
completely different and much more peaceful around here since I read <br/>
that book (last summer).  One word of advice: you have to be <br/>
completely open to a paradigm shift, because what he says makes so <br/>
much sense, but goes against everything most of us have been raised <br/>
to believe about parenting and children.  Oh, and I recommend that <br/>
DH reads it too (I am still working on this one &lt;g&gt;).  <br/>
<br/>
If you want to really get it into your system, follow it up with <br/>
Kohn&#39;s older book Punished by Rewards.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-691761648">What about just saying what you told us?  Something like, &quot;You know,  my <br/>
parents never spanked, grounded, or sent us to our rooms...never had a time  out <br/>
in my life.  And for some reason, it really worked!  I know  there&#39;s a lot of <br/>
people who believe in that stuff, but I turned out pretty OK  without it.  I <br/>
don&#39;t do it with my kids either, and you know, it seems to  be working pretty <br/>
well.  Were you spanked as a kid?&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
If they say &quot;yes&quot; maybe ask them if they think it worked, or how it made  <br/>
them feel, etc.  It&#39;s really easy to talk about these things if you  &quot;disguise&quot; <br/>
it with letting them talk about themselves, and their lives.   Taking the &quot;you <br/>
should&quot; out of it takes a lot of the defensiveness they would  react with <br/>
away.  Then you can somehow work it round to letting them know  how you do things <br/>
and how happy you are about your life and your kid&#39;s  lives.  <br/>
 <br/>
Of course, they could snort and roll their eyes, like Sandra said...and  they <br/>
probably will :o)  But at least you can feel like you&#39;ve done your  good deed <br/>
for the day by mentioning there are other ways.  You might decide  it&#39;s <br/>
easier to be around people who are more like you. <br/>

Does it make you feel good?  Your kids?  If not, just stop.  I liked <br/>
what someone else responded about asking open-ended questions.  I am a <br/>
former doula and La Leche League Leader and stopped both those <br/>
activities primarily because I wanted to spend all my time with my <br/>
daughter, but also because I didn&#39;t want to be constrained in what I <br/>
was able to say.  I want to say what I believe to be true . . . all of <br/>
it!<br/>
<br/>
As  for suggestions of alternatives I love the following two websites:<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A very effective thing to do would be to ask a question like that in  <br/>
the same tone and at the same volume the other parent has just used.   <br/>
If he yells at his child, &quot;I said to STOP IT!&quot; you could imitate him  <br/>
with &#39;Why are you YELLING!?&quot;  Or something in the same rhythm.   It  <br/>
would probably stun him long enough  for you to say, &quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry.   <br/>
I never talk to anyone that way, not adults or kids.  Just thought  <br/>
you might not realize how you sounded.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve done mini-versions of that with my kids when they were using a  <br/>
harsh tone of voice to one of the other kids (or me) and I didn&#39;t  <br/>
want to talk about it but I still wanted them to hear it.<br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;ll look for an opportunity to do it to someone else.   I did it  <br/>
over the fence to my unseeable neighbors once, mostly for Holly&#39;s  <br/>
benefit.  She was yelling at her kids in nasty, mean tones of voice,  <br/>
and I yelled &quot;STOP YELLING AT THEM!&quot;   It got very quiet over there.  <br/>
&lt;g&gt;  We tried not to laugh out loud, so we just covered our mouths  <br/>
and giggled.<br/>
<br/>
I still lose my temper, but it&#39;s never as big or as quick as it used  <br/>
to be.  Partly I&#39;ve practiced, partly I&#39;m older, partly my kids are  <br/>
not constrained from saying &quot;Lighten up, mom!&quot;   I have a confession  <br/>
of a very bad mom moment in here:<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have had to go and archive back a few thoughts ;)...<br/>
<br/>
I am going to do my best to articulate how important this post was and<br/>
how the &quot;zeneverything&quot; post was meaningful to me. <br/>
<br/>
I often feel that I&#39;m an &quot;in the trenches&quot; Mommy lately. First off I<br/>
have a 7 yr old, a 3 yr old and a baby. I feel pulled in all sorts of<br/>
ways. I look at friends who are *just* embarking on their parenting<br/>
&quot;life&quot; and hear/see their ideal/ideas and thoughts and don&#39;t seem to<br/>
have much patience for their &quot;hard&quot; stuff. Then I talk to others whom<br/>
I *completely* identify with in the moment with similar aged children.<br/>
Lastly, I have my friends who are so far past this &quot;childhood&quot; and<br/>
with grown children or teenagers. When I&#39;m feeling &quot;lost&quot; or confused<br/>
with my choices I have to both look behind and then forward to get to<br/>
*my* present. We&#39;ve had a busy last few months.I am an artist with<br/>
paint, pastel, pencil, etc...not with words, so you&#39;ll have to bear<br/>
with me ;). <br/>
<br/>
In the last 6 mos we have uprooted, moved out of state, had a baby,<br/>
and now my dh works at home. Okay, along with the &quot;move out of state&quot;<br/>
we have moved out of So CA (a place of vague seasonal awareness)and to<br/>
WA (a place of acute! seasonal awareness). My usual comfort of friends<br/>
with like minds have all but vanished. Last week I found them BTW, in<br/>
a small, but intimate group (hope abounds!). <br/>
<br/>
Sooooo, my main point of this whole post is that I *NEED* to hear<br/>
those confessions that Sandra put out there. The ones where others<br/>
have slipped up and been angry (out of pure frustration, tiredness,<br/>
whatever). It isn&#39;t that they slipped up or did angry wrong things<br/>
that gives me hope, it is the compassion and caring that goes into the<br/>
problem solving or the resolution that gives me inspiration.<br/>
<br/>
 They help to make or mold me in-TO a better parent. I need to know<br/>
you all messed up along the way because of a VERY different past or<br/>
whatever it was... :( I appreciate the same honesty and<br/>
forthrightness...(is that a word?). It is so cathartic to hear this<br/>
*side* of your parenting journey. It sounds like I&#39;m trying to shoot<br/>
for a lower goal of some weird &quot;misery loves company&quot; ideal, but<br/>
truely it makes me think...ok these people are real, they make<br/>
mistakes and tell their children they (themselves) were wrong and life<br/>
goes on in a better more connected way. <br/>
<br/>
Am I babbling a mental confusion of my convoluted thoughts or is this<br/>
just something you have heard before and have a nice article for....;)<br/>
cuzzz I needs ta hear it ch&#39;all ;).<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi Ticia,<br/>
<br/>
First off, I appreciate your honesty (and bravery!) in asking this question.<br/>
I think we all breathe a little sigh of relief (at least I do) when I hear<br/>
about the mistakes of people I admire and respect. And how the mistake was<br/>
handled. You&#39;re right, it reminds us that we are all human.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I personally don&#39;t want to DWELL on my mistakes, but can tell you<br/>
that at least weekly, and sometimes more often, I misstep in interacting<br/>
with my child(ren). Usually it is quite obvious, as by now we have a pretty<br/>
smooth situation as a family. My kids have no problem pointing out a<br/>
misstep, for sure (and they are often kind about such a thing). Sometimes<br/>
it&#39;s something more subtle, and I will just &quot;feel&quot; like I did something<br/>
wrong without really knowing what until I replay the situation.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are teenagers, the oldest is 17, and we have been unschooling for<br/>
quite some time. So one point is that the questioning and refining and<br/>
conscientious thought haven&#39;t ended for me...I&#39;m not sure that any of us are<br/>
completely &quot;there&quot; all the time. Part of unschooling is the commitment as<br/>
parents to continue to think and be mindful of how we are acting with our<br/>
children, and to be humble in acknowledging when we have made a mistake, and<br/>
to make appropriate adjustments. It is a process. Most of us have many years<br/>
of conditioning from our own upbringings, and for me, the triggers still<br/>
come sometimes. But because I do have a commitment to be respectful and<br/>
supportive of my children always, it is pretty easy to make changes. In fact<br/>
joyful.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I get in &quot;reactive&quot; mode, rather than &quot;responsive&quot; or even<br/>
&quot;reflective&quot; mode, both of which seem to serve my children and me better<br/>
(except when there is a fire or a swerving car coming our way). In<br/>
particular, the whole time thing, you know...when someone has to be<br/>
somewhere by a certain time and yet people aren&#39;t ready...that sometimes<br/>
makes me start the tape &quot;Come on! Let&#39;s go! We all had a whole hour to get<br/>
ready...why aren&#39;t you all in the car??&quot; kinda thing. It&#39;s a response from<br/>
my days of needing to please others, as well as what was said to me as a<br/>
child.<br/>
<br/>
So I do think it is important and respectful to get to a place on time to<br/>
our best ability when someone else is depending on it...it seems respectful<br/>
to do our best to meet an agreement like this with another person. But<br/>
instead of the demeaning language and tone that I heard growing up, I have<br/>
replaced it with doing my best to help each and every person in whatever way<br/>
they may need get into the car. I remind a child to please use the restroom<br/>
15 minutes before we leave...the child who often goes into the bathroom when<br/>
we are supposed to be going out the door. And make sure that everyone&#39;s<br/>
shoes are lined up at the door. And load the car with whatever &quot;stuff&quot; is<br/>
needed so that it&#39;s already taken care of. Or make a list of &quot;to do&#39;s&quot; to<br/>
help give everyone a visual reminder of what they may need to do. Or tell<br/>
the other person that we need a window rather than an exact time, and then<br/>
go for the earliest part of the window so that we have time for last minute<br/>
needs. These are all more effective than yelling &quot;Hurry up! Come on!! You&#39;re<br/>
making us late!&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Just some thoughts sparked by your post Ticia :o)<br/>

Thanks,<br/>

That&#39;s a great way to describe it.  I hadn&#39;t thought of it that way,  <br/>
but over the years it got easier and easier for me to apologize, to  <br/>
notice when I was doing something too thoughtlessly, or to explain  <br/>
(as the kids got older) what I thought might&#39;ve triggered my  <br/>
reaction, and that analysis helped them and me too.   It gives them a  <br/>
bad example but they don&#39;t have to suffer the whole of the stupid  <br/>
move, as I retract it quickly and discuss why people are sometimes  <br/>
that way and what better ways are like.   It gives them an example of  <br/>
changing actions midstream too, which I think is healthy.<br/>

One thing I treasure about my dad, is that when he would get mad at us when  <br/>
we were kids and teenagers, and blow his top which was very rare, he&#39;d always  <br/>
come back and apologize.  I can only remember a few times he spanked us,  and <br/>
I remember him coming to my room and hugging me and saying sorry and  talking <br/>
it all over (my transgressions, his anger, etc.)<br/>
 <br/>
He is by no means perfect, but even now, if he is in a bad mood (he&#39;s  almost <br/>
80 now!) and maybe gives his opinion a bit too strongly or judgementally,  <br/>
he&#39;ll later apologize or let us know how much he loves us (my sister and I), how <br/>
 proud he is of us, what a good job he feels we&#39;re doing as parents.  <br/>

I just posted the below quote on a local unschooling board, so some <br/>
may have seen it (sorry), but it is really about just what Jackie is <br/>
talking about, at least to me.  I hope you don&#39;t mind my sharing it <br/>
here too.  This is from Shea Darian&#39;s book Sanctuaries of Childhood, <br/>
which in general I did NOT like (too many Waldorf &#39;rules&#39;. I only <br/>
add the first paragraph for context, the second paragraph captures <br/>
for me the heart of unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
While I think it&#39;s heartwarming to think our kids picked us as  <br/>
parents and the responsibility of living up to the faith they had in  <br/>
us can be energizing, it also means kids choose drug addict,  <br/>
alcoholic and abusive parents and it justifies the parents continuing  <br/>
their abusive behavior since the children supposedly knew what the  <br/>
parents were like before they chose them :-/<br/>
