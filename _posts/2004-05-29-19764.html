<div id="ygrps-yiv-23751027">I am a terrible speller.  Lexie hasn&#39;t been very good at spelling or so <br/>
I thought.  She doesn&#39;t write a lot, but she reads constantly.  And very <br/>
very quick.  She reads entire blocks of text, as I do, so I was/am <br/>
pretty sure that spelling would be more difficult for her. <br/>
<br/>
TOday we were out with our friend, Ashi, who is a few months older than <br/>
Lexie, but in the 3rd grade (soon to be 4th.)  We were eating out and <br/>
they were doing the games on the back of the menus, and Ashi asked how <br/>
to spell something.  Lexie responded correctly.  It was a fairly easy <br/>
word, but not one with normal spelling, and Lexie knew it.  I just kinda <br/>
smiled and went on reading the paper.  It is all working out.<br/>
