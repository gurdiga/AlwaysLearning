<div id="ygrps-yiv-936020846">Children aren&#39;t always very good at coming up with ideas about how to<br/>
trade peacefully. I think it&#39;s a good chance to figure out all sorts<br/>
of things, like personal boundaries and negotiating and things like<br/>
that. Things that many adults aren&#39;t very good at. I&#39;m learning all<br/>
the time about this kind of thing too. I feel sort of unskilled at<br/>
negotiating especially when it comes to stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Karl and I started going to a local homeschool Legos Club and the<br/>
owner and facilitator of that group has called a halt to trading<br/>
because children have left feeling bad about the results.<br/>
<br/>
Do any of you have some ideas that would make trading more successful<br/>
for the children? Ways to make the transitions involved in trading<br/>
easier on the children involved? Other ideas than trading to share and<br/>
get to use pieces they don&#39;t have (can&#39;t think of any... )?<br/>

makes me think so).<br/>
<br/>
What if parents and kids selected pieces in advance of the Lego club  <br/>
meeting - pieces that the children are willing to part with? Then each  <br/>
parent can help their child be sure in advance what is on the table  <br/>
for trading and what isn&#39;t.<br/>
Take a separate box of tradeable items, maybe.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1541483479">That&#39;s very helpful. I didn&#39;t attend the club meeting where the bad<br/>
feelings happened. But Karl and I have been in on tense times when<br/>
trading DS games. Similar feelings can arise.<br/>
<br/>
And I agree that being pressured was very likely involved -- the<br/>
impromptu nature of traders seeing something they want and trading for<br/>
it with pieces that others aren&#39;t necessarily as interested in. Boxes<br/>
for trade of things a child is willing to let go of makes a lot of<br/>
sense.<br/>

Almost inevitably, fast-talking older kids persuade younger or more passive kids to give them the good cars, in Pokemon and other such trading situations.  Probably it&#39;s similar.<br/>

Maybe having catalogs with the values of the pieces right there would help some?<br/>

That&#39;s the problem, though.  &quot;Success&quot; is in they eye of the winner, the one with the advantageous trade.  Absolutely equal trades are quite rare, even among adults.<br/>

I think maybe only the adults should trade things, not the kids.  Let the moms broker the trades, if there are to be any.  Or photograph the trade, and give a buyer&#39;s remorse period.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1890341960">I doubt fair often means equal, although I think that&#39;s what people<br/>
think it means. And knowing what you have and what you want -- that<br/>
can be tough to figure. Absolutely, the kids have different abilities<br/>
and different stuff to trade that might not be of close or equal<br/>
value, in which case trading could wait until a better chance comes<br/>
up. Karl isn&#39;t confident with trading on his own, and I don&#39;t know if<br/>
he or every kid in Lego Club are even interested.<br/>
<br/>
It would be good to have a catalog handy for reference and also go<br/>
over the value of stuff beforehand. Showing the different things<br/>
involved in making trades --about what things are worth and knowing<br/>
ahead of time which things the child is ready to use for trade-- makes<br/>
a lot of sense.<br/>
<br/>
Cuz that&#39;s the other thing: I don&#39;t think the kids are the only ones<br/>
who care about the outcome. Parents spend to acquire Legos and they<br/>
might consider trading down too much not so swift.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-848265236">Yes, the idea of temporary trade -borrow has worked really well<br/>
between Karl and his long-distance cousins. I think the accountability<br/>
of visiting often and being related has something to do with that.<br/>
<br/>
I suggested the idea on the online list, and came up with a no-go on<br/>
it. :/ And it&#39;s a mixed group of homeschoolers not mostly unschoolers<br/>

Whether the parents want to save their own money or whether they want to protect their children&#39;s feelings (or integrity), it&#39;s a legitimate decision, and the topic might not be helping anyone unschool.  It needs to be brought back to general principles, not more toward the particulars of one person/meeting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2133492574">My kids have been involve in a Bakugan club that the the woman that coordinates it made the descision to have no trading. When it first started, they were trading things and one of the kids got upset after he got home.  My son and one of his friends have wanted to trade things there so we just ask them to wait till after the club is over and then his Mom and I discuss the trade with them and make sure it mutual.  Yesterday this same Mom called to say that her son and James had come to a deal on the sale of a DS game. (James wanted to buy it)  She wanted to make sure I knew what was going on and that she had checked the worth of the game after they had descided on an amout to make sure it was appropriate.  Again, I talked about it with my son to make sure he was happy with the descision.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1788181072">We too decided sometime back to keep a separate box of stuff that both my<br/>
children did not mind parting with or sharing. That really helped. Even when<br/>
we have kids come over for playdates we decide before hand which toys, or<br/>
books etc that we can keep out for playing or sharing. The rest we simply<br/>
lock away.<br/>

I learnt this when my son had been given a lovely tent by his grandparents<br/>
and the kids who came for his birthday party simply tore it apart. Poor<br/>
Ishaan did not get even a full 24 hours to play in his tent! The feeling<br/>
sunk in later after the kids had left.<br/>

Did you join an existing homeschooling group with a leader who already <br/>
decided not to allow trading and now you&#39;re trying to get them to allow <br/>
it again? Why?  I mean, why not just go along with the decision that the <br/>
group is a &quot;no-trading-allowed&quot; group if that&#39;s the way they&#39;ve already <br/>
decided they want it? If you and Karl can&#39;t live with that, then maybe <br/>
the group is not appropriate for you.<br/>
<br/>
If it isn&#39;t a bunch of unschooling families who are committed to <br/>
supporting their kids&#39; interests, then it seems you&#39;d probably be just <br/>
banging your head on a wall to try to find a more unschoolish solution - <br/>
meaning that their priority is not the same as yours. They aren&#39;t going <br/>
to care as much about supporting the kids&#39; interests in trading as they <br/>
are going to be in simply (easily, without a big effort) preventing the <br/>
kids from squabbling and ending up unhappy with trades. They probably <br/>
won&#39;t want to put in the effort that it would take, the trial and error, <br/>
the discussion and thought, to figure out a way to help the kids trade <br/>
happily. They aren&#39;t there for the trading (or for whatever interests <br/>
the kids might happen to have). They are there for the specific purpose <br/>
of that group - the building. The trading, to them, is a distraction <br/>
from why they brought their kids to that group.<br/>

<br/>
And if only half the kids want to trade, and that happens to be the half that wants to take advantage of weaker, younger other kids, it&#39;s just too great a problem.  <br/>
<br/>
I think the cardgame shop where Kirby worked only allowed trades outside the shop.  If people wanted to trade they had to go out on the sidewalk or somewhere to sit, and discuss the trade.  And that was very inconvenient so it didn&#39;t much happen.   (If I remember, I&#39;ll ask Kirby to refresh my memory.)<br/>

That&#39;s my hunch. They are mostly eclectic and school-at-home people, I<br/>
think.<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re right, Pam, that I am going to have better luck meeting<br/>
with unschoolers. I&#39;ve been feeling out the local scene and it looks<br/>
better than it did, even just a couple years ago.<br/>

&gt; I have no idea how parents are thinking as they haven&#39;t posted<br/>
&gt; anything. The group leader has called a temporary halt until things<br/>

&gt; knows the kids like to trade.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If it seems like not an unschooling question, that&#39;s fine. I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; need to talk more. Thanks for all the responses. Helpful suggestions<br/>
&gt; for me to consider presenting to the lady running the club. Maybe.<br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Whether the parents want to save their own money or whether they want to<br/>
&gt;&gt; protect their children&#39;s feelings (or integrity), it&#39;s a legitimate<br/>
&gt;&gt; decision, and the topic might not be helping anyone unschool.  It needs<br/>
&gt;&gt; to<br/>
&gt;&gt; be brought back to general principles, not more toward the particulars of<br/>
&gt;&gt; one person/meeting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1519839754">Lisa, those are excellent ideas. I will use them at some point in one<br/>
group or another, even if this one doesn&#39;t work out. But we&#39;ll try<br/>
another time to see what Karl thinks.<br/>
