<div id="ygrps-yiv-599888866">Okay, you all were sooo wonderful offering advice on my son and his introverted nature <br/>
and shyness...I&#39;m hoping you might also have suggestions on this new phase he&#39;s going <br/>
thru...<br/>
<br/>
For the past two weeks, my 5 yr old son is having *major* clothing issues.  He says every <br/>
pair of pants and/or underwear hurts him.  I&#39;ve looked all over his lower body and cannot <br/>
find ANYTHING that would cause the clothes to be uncomfortable - no rashes, bruises, <br/>
scratches, bumps - NOTHING.  And yet trying to get him into a clean pair of underwear <br/>
and/or pants can take up to an hour and involves a lot of crying, whining, etc. (on both <br/>
our parts).  <br/>
<br/>
I really believe this is all in his head, because once I can get him into a pair of pants or <br/>
pajama bottoms and he wears it for a little while, he is fine and then doesn&#39;t want to <br/>
change out of them into anything else.  I&#39;ve given up on trying to get him dressed and am <br/>
just letting him wear his pajamas every day and night.  But...he needs to at least change <br/>
his underwear (yes - he *does* need to!).  I have no problem with taking him out in his <br/>
pajamas, but HE does.  He doesn&#39;t want to leave the house, because he&#39;s embarrased <br/>
about wearing his pajamas, but there is no one at home to leave him with, and I have <br/>
responsibilites outside the house that need to be met.  Plus, after several days, his <br/>
pajamas are very dirty and need to be washed...<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone dealt with something similar?  I&#39;m trying hard to be sensitive to whatever this <br/>
is that he&#39;s going thru - being willing to take my kids out in pajamas is a *huge* step for <br/>
me, as is letting him wear pajamas day in and day out.  But I don&#39;t know what else to do.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1483646640">This isn&#39;t off topic.  He&#39;s learning how to be comfortable and have  <br/>
his needs met, and you&#39;re learning that not all parenting goes easily.<br/>
<br/>
Even if it is &quot;in his head,&quot; that&#39;s his head.  That&#39;s the head he  <br/>
uses to love you, and to learn, and to decide whether he wants to  <br/>
continue to be in the world.  Cooperate with whatever&#39;s in his head  <br/>
and respect it.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re looking on him instead of on the clothes.  I have to take ALL  <br/>
tags out of my clothes.  I rarely wear new clothes without washing  <br/>
them first.  Maybe you&#39;re using a fabric softener that&#39;s irritating  <br/>
to him.  Downy is wonderful for some kids and painful for others.<br/>
<br/>
What else has changed in the past two weeks?  Did you change  <br/>
detergent?  Are you drying things on the line instead of in a dryer?<br/>
<br/>
-=-. I have no problem with taking him out in his<br/>
pajamas, but HE does.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you can find &quot;lounge pants&quot; that are flannel but not pajama- <br/>
print.  Kirby went through a long phase of not wanting to wear  <br/>
anything like jeans, so he wore cotton sweatpants and sweatshirts,  <br/>
day and night, for a couple of years.  In the summer, lighter version  <br/>
of same.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Has anyone dealt with something similar? -=-<br/>
<br/>
Most parents have, I think.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I&#39;m trying hard to be sensitive to whatever this is that he&#39;s  <br/>
going thru --=-<br/>
<br/>
It may not be something he&#39;s &quot;going through&quot; so much as something  <br/>
that has changed in his environment or has changed in him.<br/>
<br/>
Kids who are distracted or uncomfortable or unhappy or embarrassed  <br/>
can&#39;t learn.  He needs to be comfortable for learning to happen, so  <br/>
it&#39;s very ON topic for unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1931383283">Excuse me if I sound curt but I am just dashing this off in the few moments<br/>
I have.<br/>
<br/>
1. Dump the &quot;pajamas&quot;.   Have him sleep in pajama-like clothing that is also<br/>
conventional for leaving the house.   Sweatpants for cool weather, and what<br/>
we called &quot;boxer&quot;  shorts (not the underwear, just elastic waist simple<br/>
design) in warm weather.<br/>
<br/>
2. Remove tags/labels, etc.   Also look for clothing with &quot;flat-face&quot; seams.<br/>
<br/>
3. Underwear comes in more &quot;styles&quot; these days and I am not completely<br/>
familiar with what is available for the younger set.  My grown sons wear<br/>
boxers or boxer briefs but only the kind where the elastic waist is<br/>
completely enclosed in fabric.  They do not like the feel of  &quot;bare&quot;<br/>
elastic.    If he is wearing &quot;tighty-whities&quot;  then you might look for<br/>
larger sizes.<br/>
<br/>
4. Be sure you are using a perfume free, &quot;non-allergenic&quot;  detergent in your<br/>
laundry.   Double rinsing wouldn&#39;t hurt either.  And no fabric softeners in<br/>
laundry or dryer sheets in dryer.<br/>
<br/>
Being okay after having clothes on a while doesn&#39;t necessarily mean &quot;it&#39;s<br/>
all in his head&quot;.  Could be that the irritant dissipates or the fabric<br/>
softens after a while.<br/>

first son did not wear blue jeans until he was 7 or 8 years old.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re focusing on all the outside stuff. Ignore all that, it doesn&#39;t<br/>
matter. What matters is that he&#39;s having a CLEAR feeling, and if you start<br/>
teaching him to ignore those feelings for expediency, that&#39;s not a real good<br/>
direction to go.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Has anyone dealt with something similar?  I&#39;m trying hard to be sensitive<br/>
&gt; to whatever this<br/>
&gt; is that he&#39;s going thru -<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For Rowan, specifically (not saying this is true of any other kid, just<br/>
mine), he had sensory issues that came and went. Kinda like how your body<br/>
feels not-quite-like-home during a sudden weight change or growth spurt,<br/>
until your brain figures out where your balance and your extremities are? So<br/>
we did the same things with him that I did to deal with it when I was<br/>
pregnant... we did a lot of skin brushing (basically just gently stroking<br/>
the skin with a soft brush, which feels really good and reminds your nerves<br/>
where your skin is), lots of time soaking in the tub, and some<br/>
cranial-sacral adjustments (to make sure all the bits are communicating<br/>
ideally with all the other bits; if you have a nerve pinch or restriction or<br/>
something, your body can give you weird messages about itself). Every time<br/>
he&#39;d have a big growth spurt, the sensitivity thing would re-emerge, and<br/>
we&#39;d go through the routine. Interestingly, he&#39;s figured out at this point<br/>
that doing yoga with me seems to also help him re-establish coordination<br/>
when he&#39;s just changed shape really fast.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not to say that there aren&#39;t types of clothing he hates. He&#39;s super<br/>
sensitive to the smallest amount of wool content, and what the heck is it<br/>
about people who make kids clothes with those huge hunkin irritating sharp<br/>
tags in them??? He mostly lives in fleece sweats and cotton t-shirts and<br/>
cotton socks, to sleep in and to play in.<br/>
<br/>
HTH!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-302788177">My 5 year old only wears seat pants, no tags, no underwear, special seamless socks and he picks his colors. He was even more sensitive when younger and have gone out many times in his pajamas in the past 2 years.<br/>
  We always try to find him what works for him. I can understand him because I am very sensitive to clothes too. Tags can drive me insane.<br/>
  We also use no fabric softener and our clothes are pretty soft but not itchy.<br/>
  Try sweat pants, tag less shirts and what is the problem if he does not wear underwear?? Many men don&#39;t. (by the way my DH does)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1224712724">I think some kids are more sensitive to the feel of clothing- my <br/>
girls are 5 and 3 and they mostly spend the day in their underwear <br/>
though when visitors come over they bolt to the bedroom to get <br/>
clothes on. When we go out they pick whatever they want to wear- if <br/>
it is early morning we usually go in pj&#39;s- to church no less and <br/>
people always comment but it is a come as you are church so really <br/>
no big deal- there are a few more showing up with pj&#39;s though.<br/>
<br/>
As much as possible let him wear what he wants to. Discuss that if <br/>
he has stuff in his underwear it starts to stink or makes him sore <br/>
or somthing and that changing those are a good idea.<br/>
<br/>
My 3 yr old will want to wear a peed in pair of undies if she thinks <br/>
there are no more- when I explain that they are in the dryer she is <br/>
more than happy to change.<br/>
<br/>
She is also the one who picks two different shoes to go out in which <br/>
gave me pause and drives grandma crazy but that is what she wants<br/>
<br/>
Let go of how he is dressed being a reflection of who you are as a <br/>
parent and it get easier. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe if he knows you will let him put them back on he will let you <br/>
wash them or get 5 pairs to the ones he loves.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1415670201">***my 5 yr old son is having *major* clothing issues. ****<br/>
<br/>
Stop thinking of this as &quot;major.&quot;   It is what it is.  <br/>
<br/>
***He says every <br/>
pair of pants and/or underwear hurts him.***  <br/>
<br/>
***I really believe this is all in his head, ***<br/>
<br/>
Probably not.  My kid was like this and later we found out he has psoriasis.  Maybe the one thing had nothing to do with the other and maybe it did.  You&#39;re kid probably doesn&#39;t have psoriasis but just because you don&#39;t understand what he&#39;s feeling or see any reason for him to feel that way doesn&#39;t mean what he&#39;s feeling is imaginary.   If he says the clothes bug him, believe him.  <br/>
<br/>
I bring up the psoriasis because I get especially peeved when parents start talking about sensory this or that disorders when kids don&#39;t like clothing seams or certain textures of fabric or foods or whatever.  There might be lots of reasons clothes and textures bug kids, it doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re &quot;disordered.&quot;   We forget what it&#39;s like to be new to wearing clothes.   We&#39;ve been in them for years but kids are new to this and getting used to how things feel is done on the learners individual schedule same as learning to eat with a spoon and learning to use the potty and learning to read or ride a bike.  Stop thinking of this as some problem or defect and you&#39;ll all feel better.  Help him be comfortable.  If you&#39;ve ever had an uncomfortable bra think how irritated you&#39;d be if someone said it was all in your head.  <br/>
<br/>
*** But I don&#39;t know what else to do.***<br/>
<br/>
Try flannel pants inside out.  Sweatpants inside out with the leg elastic cut.  Socks inside out. Shirts inside out. Try clothes a size too big, inside out  Try boxers or no underwear at all, sometimes those multiple layers rub or bunch or flap and feel weird.  Don&#39;t let clothes get even a little snug. Clothes that are getting a little tight rub and constrict.  Some people can ignore that and some can&#39;t.  Go with big, loose, inside out. <br/>
<br/>
Dylan was very sensitive about his clothes but somewhere along about seven or eight years old he gradually became more comfortable and started wearing clothes right side out. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-274862949">**slapping head***   I don&#39;t know why inside out everything didn&#39;t occur to<br/>
me when it would have been sooooooooooo helpful.  Could have saved time in<br/>
looking for clothes with &quot;finished&quot; seams.    I don&#39;t sew (more than very<br/>
minor repairs)  so I was not able to utilize my mother&#39;s solution of making<br/>
most of my clothes and &quot;flat-facing&quot; the seams.   Even as a young child I<br/>
was very appreciative of her willingness to expend the effort to keep me<br/>
comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
Loose is an important suggestion.   Also for &quot;bottoms&quot; it sometimes helps to<br/>
have overalls or coveralls so that there is nothing suspended from the<br/>
waist.   Jeans may be tight all over as well as stiff  and sweatpants are an<br/>
improvement but can still be irritating.   &quot;Sagging&quot; pants is not always<br/>
just a fashion statement,  it can be more comfortable.    Overalls can keep<br/>
the belly warm without irritating the waist and still allow plenty of<br/>
freedom of movement  so that squatting, etc. is comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
I was thrilled when tagless t-shirts came out.  The downside of cutting out<br/>
tags (besides leaving a rough strip or holes in the neck binding if not done<br/>
very carefully)  was losing the size marking.   Laundry markers or even<br/>
permanent sharpies will last for  dozens of launderings.  Marking the size<br/>
instead of the owner&#39;s name or initial works better when items are  &quot;passed<br/>
down&quot; or shared.   But the tagless shirts were absolutely best, the size<br/>
marking stays visible with no maintenance and for longer than even if the<br/>
tag were left on.   I had teens by the time they were introduced in adult<br/>
sizes.   Do they come in small children&#39;s sizes now?    Are they available<br/>
on more than sports uniforms, tshirts, or tank tops?<br/>
<br/>
Your comment about multiple layers made me think of something we used to<br/>
say................it was from a movie or book or something,  I&#39;ll bet<br/>
Sandra can pull up the source!.     Had to do with knit briefs becoming<br/>
popular (before the day of boxer briefs....anyone remember when boxers did<br/>
not have elastic waists?)  and calling boxers &quot;Indian Drawers&quot;.    Some boys<br/>
preferred tighty whities to boxers because the boxers tend to &quot;sneak up on<br/>
you&quot;.   Very politically incorrect language but one of those shorthand terms<br/>
that was pretty widespread in certain decades.<br/>
<br/>
Now if only I could find a satisfactory replacement for the underwear for ME<br/>
that I finally found but when I went back to stock up were no longer<br/>
available :-(   :-(.<br/>

Better than &quot;banded knit&quot; legs which stretch out and ride up.<br/>

but loose black socks are<br/>

&quot;Black socks never get dirty<br/>
The longer you wear them the blacker they get.<br/>
Sometimes I think I should wash them<br/>
But something inside me keeps saying not yet, not yet, yet..........&quot;<br/>

<br/>
I hope this isn&#39;t too much info, but I just wanted to say that if a<br/>
young boy *has to* change his underwear daily, maybe a he needs a<br/>
little loving guidance with how to keep his bum clean with a warm<br/>
washcloth and some soapy water. <br/>
5yrs old can be awfully young to be able to do some things and I think<br/>
it&#39;s a kind thing to show our kids how to take care of themselves in<br/>
that way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-212351684">The term &quot;Indian Drawers&quot; was in my all time favorite children&#39;s book, <br/>
Cheaper by the Dozen, by/about the Gilbraith family...or perhaps the <br/>
sequel, Belles on Their Toes. Maybe they said they &quot;creep up on you&quot;? I <br/>
read this book again and again. <br/>
<br/>
BTW I really think this book is why efficiency is a big value for me, <br/>
since the dad was the first big efficiency expert. Don&#39;t worry, I don&#39;t <br/>
try to parent efficiently!!! I&#39;m all about not interrupting my child <br/>
when she is concentrating on something :) but I do think it is great to <br/>
have systems that make daily maintance activities as quick and <br/>
automatic as possible so you have more time and energy to do other <br/>
things. <br/>

fascinated with this family and never knew they had other books. I <br/>
just requested the 4 that my library system has. I think part of my <br/>
initial fantasies of homeschooling came from visualizing the lot of <br/>
them listening to language records during times of &quot;unavoidable <br/>
delay&quot; in the bathroom. :)<br/>
