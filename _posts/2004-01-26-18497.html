<div id="ygrps-yiv-1624811703">I decided to put this part of the midterm here to let you read. <br/>
<br/>
The kids were unschooled, having never gone to school. They learned <br/>
from life itself. When people asked &quot;how could you do that?&quot; or &quot;why <br/>
aren&#39;t you in school?&quot; the two would reply, &quot;we learn from <br/>
everything around us.&quot; The parents would say &quot;we don&#39;t believe in <br/>
government control raising our children.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
and the teacher&#39;s comment: <br/>
                           How could this happen? It is illegal! <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
i was tempted to write the children&#39;s reply as &quot;we don&#39;t like people <br/>
telling us what to do&quot;</div>
