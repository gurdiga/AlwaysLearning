<div id="ygrps-yiv-1918285619">I know the request earlier in the week (or last week, time is liquid  <br/>
here) was for movies on the depression, but found a good page that  <br/>
has book lists while searching for books on a topic that Josh is  <br/>
interested in. I think it&#39;s too good of a resource to pass up, I&#39;m  <br/>
sure it&#39;s not all inclusive, but really well organized.<br/>
