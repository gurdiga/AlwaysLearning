I&#39;m soooo glad you and Sue met!!!  She&#39;s a triathlete and sounds like a <br/>
really interesting person to me.<br/>

Your dd is going to have a huge adjustment, with loads of anger.<br/>
A parent divorcing and remarrying is one of the biggest betrayals a child can <br/>
ever live through. Are you in counseling with her? I would highly recommend <br/>
finding a good one, or else she will find herself in counseling or dealing <br/>
with a lot of anger issues as an adult I would guess.<br/>
It&#39;s more difficult for kids to deal with than anyone believes. Our society <br/>
says it&#39;s all ok, they&#39;ll adjust. I don&#39;t buy that. I think seeking <br/>
counseling is a good idea. And I&#39;m really glad you&#39;re not buying into that <br/>
tough love garbage. She needs your gentleness and understanding more than <br/>
ever I&#39;m sure!!<br/>
<br/>
I will dig out my lemon curd recipe....I may have a crumpet one somewhere <br/>
although I&#39;ve never made these since leaving home. It would be fun to do with <br/>
the kids.<br/>

&gt;I guess I need to make more of a point to spend more one on one time<br/>
&gt;with her, although mostly what she asks for is more time with him.<br/>
&gt;Recently, he&#39;s been making an increased effort to spend more time with<br/>
&gt;her.  I often feel like she&#39;s just trying to keep us apart.  Three is<br/>
&gt;such a difficult number to balance, we so often end up divided two and<br/>
&gt;one.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m replying to an old post and I haven&#39;t read all the digests, yet, <br/>
since I just got back from a 10-day trip.  Forgive me if this has been <br/>
said or it has blown up into a huge argument that already died down and <br/>
I&#39;m starting it up again.  :)<br/>
<br/>
My thought for your 3 yo and your new dh is for the two of them to spend <br/>
as much time together as humanly possible.  I&#39;ve been in this situation, <br/>
and I was grateful to see my two sons bonding with my new husband.  Now <br/>
that my sons are teenagers (19 & 17), I often find myself wishing that <br/>
they had spent more time together.  It took many years before we heard <br/>
anything even resembling &quot;you&#39;re not my father!&quot; out of either of them <br/>
(first time a year ago, and we&#39;ve been married for 12 years).  So I <br/>
would say that we did a whole lot right in the bonding-with-the-stepdad <br/>
thing.  But it&#39;s never perfect.  The way I looked at it is that my sons <br/>
would soon be gone from the house (don&#39;t blink!), and I would have my <br/>
husband all to myself for the rest of our lives.  That early time when <br/>
they went to rocket-launches and baseball games together was precious to <br/>
them, served their relationship well then, and paid off in huge ways <br/>
when there was conflict later.  <br/>
<br/>
Three year olds can be fickle and I can imagine a little one pushing one <br/>
of you away by turns.  I say go with it.  Time is short.  And try not to <br/>
act too possessive of your husband, because 3 yo&#39;s are also very good <br/>
imitators.  ;)<br/>
