<div id="ygrps-yiv-303609384">People sometimes like for the longterm unschoolers to confess to  <br/>
doubts or concerns.  I don&#39;t know whether this will count at all, but  <br/>
here&#39;s one.<br/>
<br/>
Marty turned 21 today.  He&#39;s going to Las Vegas with his girlfriend  <br/>
and three other friends, all older.  The next oldest is 23, and the  <br/>
oldest is 30.  They&#39;re flying (Kirby has gone to pick them all up and  <br/>
take them to the airport), and are sharing one room.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m worried, but not about anything specific.  Just worried that it&#39;s  <br/>
dangerous and expensive and vaguely risky.  I called my friend Jeff  <br/>
yesterday.  He&#39;s Marty&#39;s godfather, and also his knight in the SCA  <br/>
(Marty&#39;s his squire), and I said &quot;jolly me up about this,&quot; and he said  <br/>
he would have been thrilled to have had that when he turned 21.  And I  <br/>
knew Jeff when he turned 21.  Heck, I knew my husband Keith when HE  <br/>
turned 21 (we weren&#39;t married until he was 27 or so).  Jeff knows all  <br/>
the people Marty will be with and pointed out how bright they all were  <br/>
and how much fun they would have.  One is a nurse, so even health and  <br/>
safety is kind of covered.<br/>
<br/>
Still, I feel unsettled.<br/>
<br/>
I think they will be fine, in my conscious thoughts.<br/>
I can figure they&#39;ll be fine in a sensible view of it.<br/>
But in my instinctive mom-parts of me I&#39;m jittery.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-537787866">Happy Birthday to Marty.  I understand he&#39;s a bit sick, so I hope  <br/>
it&#39;s not too much for a plane ride and a hotel stay.  But he&#39;s young  <br/>
and strong, so this probably won&#39;t phase him.<br/>
<br/>
If my kids (as adults) were going to go to Las Vegas, I&#39;d want Marty  <br/>
with them.  He seems to have a way with people and the world that is  <br/>
jovial and funny, yet a big, strong way of knowing what to do should  <br/>
they end up in a more challenging situation.<br/>
<br/>
What I know of Marty (from the symposium in Santa Fe, mostly, but  <br/>
from other times of meeting him too) is that he walks in a room and  <br/>
brings a bit more sunshine in with him, and can sit in a chair and  <br/>
lean back and fall, and get right back up and proceed.  He was a  <br/>
wonderful host in the game condo, making bean and cheese quesadillas  <br/>
for the younger group playing upstairs on our last night there.<br/>
<br/>
I know there are other elements to a 21 year old going to Las Vegas  <br/>
for that birthday, but Marty has a lot more going for him than your  <br/>
average 21 year old birthday person.  I hope Marty has a fine time  <br/>
and I hope your unsettled, jitteriness fades.<br/>
<br/>
Jill (who doesn&#39;t have a complete grasp of a kid in Marty&#39;s and your  <br/>
position, since my kids are only 15 and 11)<br/>
