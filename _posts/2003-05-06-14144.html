&lt;&lt; Who finally watched Little Shop of Horrors, with Rick & Steve.  Reminded <br/>
me of the dentists I went to when I was a kid.  Seemed they absolutely jammed <br/>
that Novocain needle in! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That is SUCH a fun movie.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Suddenly Seymor is SO beautiful and so beautifully done.<br/>
<br/>
Frank Oz is a hell of a director.<br/>
<br/>
That whole set was built, none of it was done outside anywhere.  <br/>
<br/>
In &quot;Downtown,&quot; watch when he goes up the alley toward the bums climing on the <br/>
gate.  He timed the steps and the distance to match the music perfectly.    <br/>
And the rhymes (changing the subject at least as to who I&#39;m praising) in that <br/>
song are really intricate and Holly noticed it and told ME about it.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it&#39;s fun.<br/>
