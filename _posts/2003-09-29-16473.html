<div id="ygrps-yiv-543563456">DH is leaving his job to retrain as an accountant & will be studying from home, working on our business and spending more time with our children. He only has 2 more days at work left now & I&#39;m a bit apprehensive about how he&#39;s going to fit in with our unstructured structure, iyswim. We&#39;re long overdue for a holiday, so I&#39;m going to book a last minute thing. Last night we were talking about where we were going over tea & he tried to set homework for it!!! He&#39;s says he&#39;s behind the autonomous way of doing things, but I don&#39;t think he quite understands how it *actually* works day to day. lol  Suggestions please for how I can help make the transition go smoothly for all of us? I know he&#39;d get there under his own steam eventually, but I&#39;d like to minimise the disruption to everyone else whilst he does.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Do you have other unschoolers around you that you hang out with?  Especially <br/>
ones a bit older than your kids.  Seeing live unschoolers in action worked <br/>
wonders on convincing my husband.  He could also probably used a reading list <br/>
requrirement before he butts in, but that depends entirely on your relationship.<br/>
<br/>
One of the nicest things my husband said to me yesterday was &quot;I was reading <br/>
Holt again this morning...&quot;  I think he was reading How Children Fail and went <br/>
on to talk about how Holt hit the nail on the head about teaching math - all <br/>
those numbers being silly symbols unless they are related to something.  <br/>
<br/>
With my husband, the converstion happened in three months.  Our kids were <br/>
only 2 and 3, so it was easier because he hadn&#39;t yet bought into the system of <br/>
school.  Good luck with yours, I&#39;m glad he&#39;s able to stay home with you.<br/>
