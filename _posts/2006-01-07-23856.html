<div id="ygrps-yiv-224137599"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Then I got to the last sentence: &quot;It&#39;s a very typical<br/>
&gt;&gt;aspie thing.&quot; And suddenly a big silent wall went up bang between me and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the experience<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;you dh has and it seemed like I couldn&#39;t relate at all&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I can see what you are saying. There was very little description there<br/>
that seemed any different from any regular Joe.<br/>
<br/>
But there is a big difference, and that&#39;s where using that aspie label CAN<br/>
be useful. His experience probably is different from yours. I can say that<br/>
there is a difference between my dh&#39;s tolerances and approximately 98% of<br/>
the hundreds (maybe thousands?) of people that I know. His responses to the<br/>
world are in a very small percentage of my known reality of many people over<br/>
many years. So the description above FOR HIM looks more intense than most<br/>
other people I&#39;ve spent lots of time with. Having been on the planet for<br/>
over 41 years, that&#39;s enough people, in my opinion to make this distinction.<br/>
And using that term &quot;Aspie&quot;, for me, helps to say &quot;It&#39;s much more intense<br/>
than the majority of people in the world&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Nanci I want to thank you for taking the time to give great detail to the<br/>
actual experience of an autistic person. It was very well written and<br/>
accurate to what I hear from my two guys.<br/>
