<div id="ygrps-yiv-1986344725">I have missed the orgnail post but have read lots of the fallow up and so <br/>
forth. I am both the grand mother that watches for free and a mother and did <br/>
run a home day care for over 11 years.Also have ex in laws and a ex husband.<br/>
 first  when I was a young mother I had my ex mother in law(not ex at time) <br/>
watch my child, she was all I had and i wanted so badly to learn from her (why <br/>
I don&#39;t know problie some part of me wanted that  mother &#39;daughter thing) Big <br/>
Big mistake in the beginning. to the point that my doctor told me look kid she <br/>
is having you take her to me for green poop( honestly she told me green meant <br/>
she was infected and need imedent help so off to  Doc I went) Doctor laffed <br/>
said ya don&#39;t want it green don&#39;t feed her peas!!<br/>
Lesson for me:  mothers Don&#39;t know every thing and They still family ,( later <br/>
lesson neither do doctors but that diff story.)<br/>
In later years I married a widower with children, We decided to go with out new <br/>
cars and other things to make it so I could stay at home and raise the kids and <br/>
I ran a home day care  for on the avrage of 11 children coming and going on a <br/>
daily  secduleI always did a 2 week trail to see if the kids could adjust and <br/>
if the parents and I could communicate and if the family&#39;s could do well <br/>
together. to elmatie the bigger problems like i need to turn into the Big bad <br/>
meanie. I may had been the hired help but I also felt I was a partner in <br/>
raising children the could be a good thing or a bad thing for all <br/>
involved.These children where to be part of my home daily.I became close to <br/>
these children and they to me we still get christmas cards and many still come <br/>
to my home or call many have kids of there own now and others do bragging with <br/>
there other freinds. sending a child to a sitter is gr8 for me and the parents <br/>
iof the children I watched as long as we knew that sending them to a sitter for <br/>
45 hours a week ment we where there to help raise happy children. there where <br/>
disagreements and we didt always agree but kept in mind that we did what was <br/>
best for the envrioment and children first if they where grounded at home  then <br/>
that was at home and if they where grounded from tv there then it was between <br/>
them  when they where older it held as i cant spend all my day keeping track <br/>
of  who is what  one from this or that.<br/>
 I also watched and still watch my grand child this is a lil different we dont <br/>
always agree and never will and guess what I am not always right and neither is <br/>
her mother.and the green poop lady still is in the picture and nuttier than <br/>
ever. and still family.<br/>
This is how we deal in our family not  by any means  the right way just how it <br/>
has worked for us:<br/>
I watch Destiny (grandchild) and the entire family watches her as I also work <br/>
we feel it is a fmily thing for us to do,we still share a lot of the same <br/>
values,we had the oppist when destiny was small I wanted my daughter to nurse <br/>
longer and she  got tired of it went to bottle guess what not my choice it was <br/>
hers. Hard lesson for me I am The grandmother not the mother. My daughter also <br/>
tok her to a sitter I didnt aprvoe of once or twice when  we couldnt sit and <br/>
guess what  I am not in charge I am greatful for what time I do have with <br/>
her.And I still have to bite my tounge alot when I here she is over there.<br/>
Then there is the green poop lady  she tryed to teach Destiny how to lie to mom <br/>
and grand ma over something they dis agreed with I opened  my mouth on this one <br/>
as it wasnt the issue of wether or not 4 was to old for a bottle  (gr8 grandma <br/>
was sneeking her one cuz a  sippie cup was inconvent for gr8 gma) I interveined <br/>
with the teaching to lie and hide things from mom my opion is and was that <br/>
teaching to lie and to use the they will be mad at you  as a threat confuses <br/>
and in my opion sets up other issuses for pretature ext.<br/>
We limited time with gr8 grand ma.2 hour streches  my daughter had a long talk <br/>
with her on what she was feeling. not that gr8 grandma still does what she <br/>
likes but that is the risk and she is family .Destiny will learn  hopefully <br/>
from those she is exposed to the most and will  still maintain a loving <br/>
realinship with her bio gr8 gama.<br/>
This is same that my paid sitting  children did we  looked for simular values <br/>
and  ways of dealing with things  in such amanner we could all live with.To <br/>
have some one watch your children paid realated or not It was important to us <br/>
as a family to rember they are in a big sence partnering in parenting. I often <br/>
have my grand child 50 or more hours a week just like I did with  baby sitting <br/>
kids. and then  a lot on week ends.In a lot of ways I know we are luckyer than <br/>
others as  my youngest is 13 and oldest is 27  WE are all different in many <br/>
ways  from devote Christens to pagan to agnostic. we all do things a lil <br/>
different when the christen  watches the pagans kid they dont take off evey <br/>
thing that says christ and so forth we dont correct each other on belifs we  <br/>
just know we are different and celbrate those differences and what a wonderful <br/>
way for US to be. the children choose, the children live and they grow. Despite <br/>
the bottles and green poop and learn  thru example, to think for them selves. <br/>
And ya know what  parents get to help  thru example of communcation and showing <br/>
of love no matter how little(or big)  the children are I for one belive they <br/>
learn about stress and conflict mangent  before day one.<br/>
These are my opions not to reflect the opions of the group as a whole.I am no <br/>
expert  and a newbie to this group myself. and value the opions of this group. <br/>
that does not mean I try every lil thing posted here  heck I dont want to darn <br/>
socks! I have found this group to be loving helpful opionated and  a gr8 asset <br/>
to my life.<br/>
