<div id="ygrps-yiv-1191852135">how about misunderstood unschooler : I was always drawing in class too then just find my place just before I had to read<br/>
  Now if the class was assigned a book to read I could never read as fast as the teacher wanted so I was never prepaired for the test.  So I learned that before the test I would tell the teacher there were somethings I wasn&#39;t &quot;clear&quot; about and that would start a discussion and answer all that was needed for the test or the teacher would have q and a sometime before the test and thats where I got all my info from.<br/>
  So not every one is as interested or geared for reading but just about everyone who wants to &quot;figures&quot; out school in there own way before it is time to graduate<br/>

I would always draw in class. If you are writing, you must be taking<br/>
notes, which I also did. If we were reading as a class, I would read<br/>
ahead, and I was usually good at finding my place when I was called to<br/>
read. Other than homework, I couldn&#39;t be bothered to read the text<br/>
books outside of school. However, I&#39;ve always been an avid reader. <br/>
I&#39;d happily read ahead in class, but never outside of school. At home<br/>
it was all Louis L&#39;Amour and Hardy Boys. I think I learned more from<br/>
Louis L&#39;Amour than I did from school.<br/>
This story just came to me. We were assigned one year to read The<br/>
Scarlet Letter. I didn&#39;t read the book till after the test and passed<br/>
with a pretty good grade. During in class discussion I would try to<br/>
answer questions, and if I was patient, could actually do a good job<br/>
just from listening to the general discussion of the book. By the<br/>
time we were supposed to have finished and then took the test, I was<br/>
actually interested enough to read it and enjoyed it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-511194350">When I was growing up I hated to read and never read a book all the way through until I was 17 or 18 yr. Even in college I would get other people to tell me about the book or just skim through it reading only what I had too unless it was an autobiography or something along those lines or something I thought looked interesting. Looking back on it now I know it was because I was always forced to read what I did not want to read. Now I can read what I want and I love to read. I now read a book a week or more. I can relate to kids who do not want to read because they have too read what they dont want to. <br/>
<br/>
  Peace and love,<br/>

  PS: I am currently reading Sanda Dodd&#39;s new book &quot;Moving a Puddle&quot; and it is a joy to read and how wonderful it is that she let us into her family&#39;s lifes. I am so curious about the way other people live and what others lives are about. Some may call me nosey I believe I just have a desire to know what goes on in other peoples real worlds beyond my own. <br/>
