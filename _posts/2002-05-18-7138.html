<div id="ygrps-yiv-371829937">I think I&#39;m finally getting it!<br/>
<br/>
If you remember my last post, I was asking about putting together a <br/>
schedule for games and movies, etc.  The consensus was not to make a <br/>
schedule because it would limit the possibilities.  The other thing I <br/>
got from what people were saying was to learn what I want to learn <br/>
for ME and stop worrying about what my children are learning or *not* <br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
At the time of my post, I had already gotten about 20 movies out of <br/>
the library.  Days went by and I could not find the right time to <br/>
show Allison and Virginia the movies.  I felt a little frustrated and <br/>
then it dawned on me, if I want to watch the movies, then I should <br/>
watch the movies for ME, *when* I want to watch them.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I watched a few of the movies, and now I am very excited about <br/>
the possibilities of watching more movies, and learning more things, <br/>
for ME!  It is very liberating to feel I no longer have to do things <br/>
because they are &quot;educational&quot; for the kid&#39;s benefit.  I can do <br/>
things because *I* want to learn or because *I* am interested and <br/>
unschooling will happen.  <br/>
<br/>
I am surprised at how much I am beginning to be interested in.<br/>

And your enthusiasm will peak their interest!!<br/>
And some things they&#39;ll also become interested in and some they won&#39;t. And<br/>
from watching you they&#39;ll learn some things that are related and become<br/>
interested in THose things and pretty soon you&#39;ll realize that It&#39;s okay to<br/>
relax.<br/>
You are doing great Pat. Don&#39;t stop bringing your concerns here and sharing<br/>
them. I am learning so much from watching your mind stretch and grow.<br/>
