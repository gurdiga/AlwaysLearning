<div id="ygrps-yiv-1117926827">&lt;&lt;They are learning quickly how hard it is to &quot;parent&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My oldest is 11.  She and the 8yo offered to cook dinner one night so I<br/>
could get ready to take them out to a Christmas play.  I was thrilled!!<br/>
After I was ready, I came into the kitchen and 11yo basically has her eyes<br/>
spinning in their sockets.  She says &quot;I just got a view of your life.&quot;<br/>
(5yo, 3yo and 2yo wanted to help which quickly deteriorated into fighting<br/>
over counterspace ending in banishment from the kitchen by the 11yo).<br/>
<br/>
I do think age makes such a difference for kids.  My 3yo is hell-on-wheels<br/>
and has been since the day he learned to scoot across the floor.  But today,<br/>
he sang in the children&#39;s choir at church, standing tall and singing his<br/>
heart out....no tantrums, no foot stomping.<br/>
<br/>
But waiting for that self-control is a long and difficult process and the<br/>
more little kids you have, the harder it is.  Kid A gets mad and takes a toy<br/>
from Kid B.  Kid B gets upset and kicks Kid A.  Kid A flops in the floor,<br/>
landing on Kid C who now is screaming and throwing stuff at both Kids A and<br/>
B.   All this happened in the few minutes you were in the kitchen helping<br/>
Kid D try to double a recipe.<br/>
<br/>
Actually the biggest thing I have found that works with my kids is talking<br/>
to them about us being a team and how we have to work together and support<br/>
each other.<br/>
