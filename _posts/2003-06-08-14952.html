<div id="ygrps-yiv-1228111851">I&#39;m hoping to get a little advice from all of you.  Dh and I were out <br/>
shopping today and he started talking about our oldest (7 dd) and how <br/>
she learns.  She&#39;s very stubborn and shuts right down if I (or anyone) <br/>
attempts to get her to read or do anything she doesn&#39;t really want to. <br/>
 I&#39;m perfectly comfortable just letting her go it at her own pace, but <br/>
dh feels that he learns the same as she does and that we need to force <br/>
her to read and do basic math now.  His reasoning is that he also hates <br/>
to be &quot;taught&quot; but that when forced, he will eventually get it...and so <br/>
will she.  <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s okay on most of our unschooling ways so far, but he has repeatedly <br/>
stated that the basics of reading and math should be taught now.  A <br/>
little background on him...he&#39;s pretty much a hand&#39;s off parent.  He <br/>
loves the girls, but I&#39;m the care provider and he&#39;s the money provider. <br/>
 I don&#39;t mean this to sound like he&#39;s cold, but he&#39;s pretty much <br/>
uninvolved.  But he does really love the girls and now he&#39;s being <br/>
interested, he&#39;s just not saying what I&#39;d like to hear.    I hope I&#39;m <br/>
explaining this well. Another example would be Aislinn&#39;s (the 7 yr old) <br/>
gymnastics.  This has been her first year and she&#39;s AWESOME at it, but <br/>
she doesn&#39;t want to go back next fall.  Now she wants to try ice <br/>
skating.  I said, great.  Dh said she should have to do gymnastics <br/>
because his parents made him play baseball in little league until he got <br/>
good and loved it.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, for the sake of his relationship with the girls and his and <br/>
mine, I don&#39;t want to just shut him out and tell him no.  I desperately <br/>
want him to be more involved and right now he&#39;s taking an interest but <br/>
if I try to push unschooling more on him now, I think it will not be a <br/>
good thing for any of us.<br/>
<br/>
If I didn&#39;t explain this well, maybe the right questions will make it <br/>
more clear.  So any questions and/or comments would be much appreciated. <br/>
 Thanks.  HeidiC.</div>

<br/>
That just means she&#39;s smart.<br/>
It also means that every single time you do that, you make it worse.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; His reasoning is that he also hates <br/>
to be &quot;taught&quot; but that when forced, he will eventually get it...and so <br/>
will she. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Are there no things he has learned on his own outside of school?<br/>
Lately? As an adult?<br/>
You have to force him to learn things now?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Dh said she should have to do gymnastics <br/>
because his parents made him play baseball in little league until he got <br/>
good and loved it.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Say she loved it because she was NOT made to do it.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;but <br/>
if I try to push unschooling more on him now, I think it will not be a <br/>
good thing for any of us.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If he pushes schooling on your daughters, for which of you is that a good <br/>
thing?<br/>
It should really be about them, not about the little boy in him.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d give him a book to read and say you&#39;ll discuss it when he&#39;s done.  Maybe <br/>
Linda Dobson&#39;s Homeschool Book of Answers.  It&#39;s pretty unschooly without <br/>
saying so on the cover.<br/>
