<div id="ygrps-yiv-1928300338">I&#39;m going to add this link to my site, and figured some of you would  <br/>
be interested.  it&#39;s in Beta and I found some glitchiness, but the  <br/>
layout is pretty interesting and there are categories of meanings of  <br/>
words.  They&#39;ve tied in to Wikipedia for some things (for English-- <br/>
other online encyclopedias for other languages, it seems), so  <br/>
unschooling and homeschooling are in there as Wikipedia has them,  <br/>
which is pretty good!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s an interactive site, so you can add suggestions and words if you  <br/>
register.<br/>
<br/>
Part of a longer e-mail, from a mom of three boys in Europe:<br/>
===================<br/>
I am working at Babylon.com, a translation software company, so I  <br/>
particularly enjoyed your &quot;Fun and Games with &quot;Language Arts&quot;  <br/>
section. We just recently launched a new free online service  <br/>
LingoZ.com. LingoZ is an online community building the world&#39;s  <br/>
largest dictionary where you may look up more than 4,500,000 terms,  <br/>
vote for definitions, post comments or add your own terms,  <br/>
definitions and glossaries. On LingoZ you can meet people from all  <br/>
over the globe interested in translation and language. (It is  <br/>
somewhat like UrbanDictionary.com, but less slang related.)<br/>
==================<br/>
It&#39;s still building, so there will be other languages to come.  Right  <br/>
now it has German, English, Spanish, French, Hebrew, Italian, Dutch  <br/>
and Portuguese.<br/>
