&gt; Well I&#39;ll have to argue this:) I&#39;ve driven in many parts of the world but I<br/>
&gt; can say that Abu Dhabi is about one of the worst. Take 10,000 illiterate<br/>
&gt; Afghanis and Pakistanis and make them taxi drivers and then add thousands<br/>
&gt; of millionaires in throw-away mercedes and jags and let me tell you it<br/>
&gt; creates slight havoc. We bought a 4-wheel drive out of necessity as you do<br/>
&gt; not want to be smaller than other people! People here haven&#39;t quite figured<br/>
&gt; out that whole white line thing of keeping your car in your own lane nor<br/>
&gt; have they figured out the speed limit signs or u-turns or anything else it<br/>
&gt; seems on some days!<br/>
&gt; Insurance is not for &quot;if&quot; you have an accident but &quot;when.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh! Oh! Marrakesh!  We didn&#39;;t actually do the driving there, and were glad <br/>
every moment. Speeding cars, lots of insane cabs, mopeds....AND mule-pulled <br/>
falling-apart wooden carts. No one seemed to notice the lines there either. <br/>
We decided it was very clear that this WAS a religious country, because you&#39;d <br/>
have to be.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-838744047">Sounds like you&#39;re describing Killeen, Texas and Ft Hood with really bad drivers.  I&#39;ve driven all over this country with a semi and this is the worst I&#39;ve had.  Been coast to coast and border to border and it&#39;s the road rage down in this part that gets people killed.<br/>
