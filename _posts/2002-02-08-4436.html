<div id="ygrps-yiv-614748879">Katrina&#39;s e-mail got me thinking.  I had signed Zak up for a science class.<br/>
It was specifically for homeschoolers taught by a professor who (a) doesn&#39;t<br/>
have any kids and obviously never homeschooled.  Zak went to the first set<br/>
of them no problem, although he didn&#39;t talk about them when he came home.<br/>
They were for 3 hours on a Thursday morning.  Then I signed him up for the<br/>
2nd set and he went to the first 2 classes (there are 4 in a session) and he<br/>
told me he didn&#39;t want to go anymore.  When I asked him why he said &quot;Dr.<br/>
Soul makes me sit in the same place all the time and I like to move<br/>
around&quot;... I said that we need to ask Dr. Soul why she does that.  So we<br/>
went to the next class and all the time in the car we were practising what<br/>
he was going to say to her.  Also we talked about what would be an<br/>
acceptable explanation and what wouldn&#39;t.  He said he wanted to wait until<br/>
he was 100 weeks older to talk to her as he was frightened.  So I went in<br/>
with him and he asked her &quot;Dr. Soul why do you make me sit in the same place<br/>
all the time when I don&#39;t want too&quot;... She said &quot;because you move around a<br/>
lot Zak and hang over other people&#39;s work.  Also because this is a mixed<br/>
class (8 of them) you and Q are in 1st grade and I have you separated by<br/>
grade).  I said that was an acceptable answer and Zak agreed with me<br/>
(although I didn&#39;t really feel that inside).  Zak seemed ok with that answer<br/>
and stayed for the class.  But the next week he didn&#39;t want to go again and<br/>
it was because of the same thing.  He wanted to be able to sit where he<br/>
wanted in the classroom and move around when he wanted.  I didn&#39;t send him<br/>
because I realized that his reason IS valid whether I think it is or not.  I<br/>
went to a &quot;regular&quot; school and was used to having to sit in the same place<br/>
and do as you were told (even though I didn&#39;t do as I was told and hated<br/>
school, all those rules and regulations that didn&#39;t make sense)... So this<br/>
week I asked him if he wanted to go to the last class and he said &quot;No I<br/>
don&#39;t want to have to sit in the same place that Dr. Soul tells me too, I<br/>
want to stay home and play&quot;... So that&#39;s what happened.<br/>
<br/>
I think that deschooling myself about &quot;classes&quot; is going to take a while.<br/>
Zak has more of a sense of what he wants to do than I do, so I&#39;m going to<br/>
have to trust him more and more and let go... Sometimes it feels so hard to<br/>
find the balance between unschooling and parenting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1297641388">Dawn, I thought you handled everything great.  Why are you questioning yourself?  Talking to Dr. Soul was valuable because she could have changed her mind.  Zak *trying* to accept Dr. Soul&#39;s rules was fine.  When what he go out of class did not out weigh his discomfort for the rules, he decided not to go anymore.  Great.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-973307013">Thank you both Sandra and Pat you both have some valid points.  I guess as<br/>
it was a class for homeschoolers I didn&#39;t think I needed to say that he&#39;s<br/>
homeschooled although I can see that I do and that is a great learning<br/>
lesson.  I&#39;ve had other people ask me what grade he&#39;s in when I say we&#39;ve<br/>
homeschooling and instead of continuing to same &quot;we homeschool&quot; in answer to<br/>
that question I usually say &quot;I have no idea what grades are.. Luckily I grew<br/>
up in England where we go by years rather than grades and I never bothered<br/>
to learn the system here&quot;... I think it&#39;s simpler if we say &quot;we homeschool&quot;<br/>
LOL.....<br/>
<br/>
Sandra I like the way you put the question to the teacher about acommodating<br/>
her... I would never have thought of that...  I just asked her why she was<br/>
doing it rather than forgetting about why she&#39;s doing it and focusing on<br/>
what my son needs... Great point...<br/>
<br/>
The only thing I would have to disagree with is that six is too young to be<br/>
expected to deal with an adult directly.  I guess because I&#39;m confused about<br/>
what&#39;s the difference between when we are talking about the ages of people?<br/>
Why would my son be more intimidated to say something to her or say<br/>
something to a man of 21 (Dr. Soul is probably about 45)?  I was there with<br/>
him and we had rehearsed in the car what he was going to say and let him<br/>
decide whether he wanted to stay at the class after she had answered his<br/>
questions.  For me, and I can only speak for myself, I believe it&#39;s<br/>
important that I teach my children very strong boundaries right from the<br/>
beginning and that there is no one they cannot ask a question of if they<br/>
don&#39;t understand something.  Zak questions rules all the time and I thought<br/>
this was another opportunity to question rules from a person who he&#39;d not<br/>
had the opportunity to ask why from?<br/>
<br/>
Dawn<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;My first thought was to have said to her &quot;He&#39;s NOT in first grade, he&#39;s<br/>
homeschooled.&quot;I would have talked to her myself, too, and said Holly&#39;s<br/>
interested in the material, but it&#39;s bothering her to be told exactly where<br/>
to sit. She needs to move around more. Can you accommodate that?&quot;Six is too<br/>
young to be expected to deal with an adult directly. That&#39;s another<br/>

problems directly.&quot; If one child complains or questions, it&#39;s easy for an<br/>
adult (especially a childless one who love control and order) to dismiss<br/>
that question as an aberration, not as a pointer to a truth.If one other<br/>
adult explains something in terms of child development or the difference<br/>
between homeschoolers and schooled kids, it will make more difference.<br/>
SANDRA<br/>
<br/>
Dawn, I thought you handled everything great. Why are you questioning<br/>
yourself? Talking to Dr. Soul was valuable because she could have changed<br/>
her mind. Zak *trying* to accept Dr. Soul&#39;s rules was fine. When what he go<br/>
out of class did not out weigh his discomfort for the rules, he decided not<br/>
to go anymore. Great.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking about this. I think that if I had a 6 yr old who<br/>
really wanted to do this him or herself, I&#39;d be fine with it. However,<br/>
many 6 year olds I know get a bit intimidated about confronting adults,<br/>
especially &quot;authority figures&quot;. If nothing else, there&#39;s a physical size<br/>
discrepancy, but I think it&#39;s more than that.  There is a power<br/>
discrepancy, and I think the kids sense it. In a situation where she is<br/>
is labeled &quot;teacher&quot; and Zac is labled &quot;student&quot;, she clearly has more<br/>
power. Adults also tend to have better reasoning skills and verbal skills<br/>
- Cacie at 6 might have been to tell someone that she didn&#39;t like<br/>
something, and how it made her feel, but she couldn&#39;t have explained that<br/>
the task was developmentally inappropriate and required skills that kids<br/>
usually don&#39;t develop until 8 or 9.<br/>
<br/>
Cacie will sometimes deal with something like this herself now, and<br/>
sometimes ask me to do it. Either way is okay. If it&#39;s someone she&#39;s<br/>
generally comfortable with but needs to confront or question  for some<br/>
reason, she&#39;s usually okay, and maybe we&#39;ll talk about it beforehand.  If<br/>
it&#39;s someone she doesn&#39;t really know or trust, she often wants me to do<br/>
it. I think she trusts me to be able to say what she means in a way that<br/>
the other person will &quot;get&quot;, and she knows that sometimes she can&#39;t do<br/>
that as well. She told me today that some of the girls on her soccer team<br/>
were saying that if the other team pushes you, it&#39;s okay to push them<br/>
back. This felt wrong to her, clearly, but she didn&#39;t want to contradict<br/>
the girl and be labeled a goody-goody. It was a frustrating game,<br/>
apparently the other team was elbowing our girls and pulling on their<br/>
sleeves, and the refs didn&#39;t call any of it. Cacie could see why the<br/>
other girl would say this, it made some sense to level the field. We<br/>
talked a bit, and I suggested that I could mention it to the coach, who<br/>
is wonderful. She liked the idea, as long as I did it in private and<br/>
didn&#39;t mention the girl&#39;s name. I agreed, and I will. We expect that the<br/>
coach will talk to all of the girls about it, and reinforce their<br/>
feelings that it&#39;s not fair while reiterating that fair play is<br/>
important, even if the other team is playing dirty.<br/>
<br/>
I do think it&#39;s important for kids to know that they can ask for whhat<br/>
they need, I just think it&#39;s important that they feel safe and ready to<br/>
do so, and that we help them until they do. <br/>
<br/>
And Dawn, I didn&#39;t forget your other email, I was doing  a quick bit of<br/>
research but I&#39;ll send you info tomorrow..<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think Cacie&#39;s coach is wonderful, and I think she&#39;s been lucky in<br/>
soccer to have two very gentle, nurturing head coaches (and both<br/>
assistant coaches have been good guys too, the one this year is a college<br/>
soccer player). Generally, in both of the leagues we&#39;ve played it, it&#39;s<br/>
considered very bad form to contradict a referee&#39;s call or tell a ref<br/>
what calls to make, and I agree with that policy. It&#39;s a hard job, and<br/>
some of the refs are only 9 or 10 years old. They don&#39;t need someone<br/>
second-guessing their calls, even in a nice way. They can&#39;t see<br/>
everything. I know this coach has very respectfully spoken to the field<br/>
ref a couple of times after a game, about some calls, but I don&#39;t think<br/>
it&#39;s appropriate during a game. <br/>
<br/>
The refs also seem to get better as the kids get older... Cacie plays on<br/>
a U9 and a U10 team, so the kids are  pretty young, and they tend to be<br/>
more thoughtless than vicious.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;But you can tell Cacie that the refs almost always  see the <br/>
&gt; retaliation, and will usually call the penalty on the person who <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think they meant to retaliate, just to use the same tactics,<br/>
like, &quot;If someone from the other team is racing you for the ball, elbow<br/>
her out of the way, since that&#39;s what they alwsys do to us.&quot; Things like<br/>
that. The girl who had the idea is probably the most competitive kid on<br/>
the team, she and Cacie have argued before. Actually, this girl has<br/>
argued with a good number of the other girls. I had gone to my car so I<br/>
wasn&#39;t there when she and Cacie first got into it, but when I arrived<br/>
Cacie was in tears and there were three or four girls at her side<br/>
supporting her and telling her that G. has &quot;yelled at&quot; them, too. The<br/>
coach also hadled that nicely...<br/>
<br/>
The game today was a very fairly-played 1-1 tie....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Tia, the sports-hating sports mum <br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>:-) I like sports. I&#39;ve been looking for a very recreational  soccer<br/>
league for thirty-something women who haven&#39;t played in years...<br/>
