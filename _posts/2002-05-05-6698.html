 Old news, Ren, and they&#39;ve done a 180 now. I don&#39;t eat there but once in a<br/>
 blue moon anyway, but I won&#39;t hold it against them anymore; they&#39;ve come a<br/>
 long way. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hey, like I said, I already don&#39;t like their food. My Grandparents try to <br/>
drag us there everytime they come and I usually squirm out of it somehow. Now <br/>
I probably won&#39;t even try.<br/>
If it were one incident that would be one thing....but I already don&#39;t like <br/>
them.<br/>
And would they have done the 180 out of the goodness of their hearts? Would <br/>
that one employee have gotten away with it if the managers didn&#39;t condone the <br/>
behavior?<br/>
I think not.<br/>
I don&#39;t think I&#39;m punishing any restaraunt chain by the bad actions of one <br/>
employee.<br/>
I think I&#39;m having a huge bad taste in my mouth when I even think about <br/>
Denny&#39;s and that&#39;s something I&#39;d rather not have when I go out to eat. There <br/>
are too many good choices to waste my time with them.<br/>
YK?<br/>

Denny&#39;s to Help Raise Funds for Civil Rights Museum<br/>
<br/>
Posted Jan. 9, 2002 (Memphis, Tenn.) -- Denny&#39;s restaurants has agreed to <br/>
help the National Civil Rights Museum raise more than $1 million for the <br/>
museum&#39;s expansion and international marketing campaign.<br/>
<br/>
Museum director Beverly Robertson said the restaurant chain will announce the <br/>
specifics of a plan to donate part of its proceeds to the museum later this <br/>
week. <br/>
<br/>
Denny&#39;s, which settled one of the biggest race discrimination lawsuits in <br/>
history seven years ago, has been cited recently by the NAACP for its efforts <br/>
to promote diversity. The chain has worked closely with civil rights groups <br/>
in an effort to rebuild its image, Robertson said. <br/>
<br/>
The restaurant chain was targeted as a class-action defendant and was charged <br/>
by the Justice Department with forcing Black customers to pay for meals in <br/>
advance, denying service and refusing to honor its free birthday meals.<br/>
<br/>
Denny&#39;s denied discrimination, but agreed in 1994 to pay more than $46 <br/>
million to settle the lawsuits. Since then, it has contributed more than $1.5 <br/>
million to 10 civil rights organizations.<br/>
