<div id="ygrps-yiv-1628648736">My little man stood up tonight at a public meeting about the EPA&#39;s<br/>
proposal to clean up our contaminated river, and spoke from his heart.  <br/>
After hearing ranchers and other land owners for and against the plan and<br/>
after listening to representatives from Atlantic Richfield and the Clark<br/>
Fork River Coalition, he stood up and said, (I wrote it down)  This has<br/>
been a problem for 100 years.  It&#39;s time to clean it up.  I know it will<br/>
be an inconvenience to some of the ranchers, but we are not the last ones<br/>
who will live on this river.  It&#39;s time to clean it up.&quot;  I thought I was<br/>
going to cry, so I just bit my lip hard and wrote what he said in my<br/>
notebook, like I&#39;d written all the other comments and blinked and blinked<br/>
away the tears.  I&#39;m such a moron.<br/>
<br/>
He said after the meeting he was so hungry up there he almost said he<br/>
knew it would be a cookie for some of the ranchers ( they had cookies and<br/>
coffee on the back table) and how glad he was he hadn&#39;t said that.<br/>
<br/>
He stayed and talked to the local EPA director after and asked questions<br/>
and was interviewed by a woman from the news paper and got to meet some<br/>
of the people from the Clark Fork River Coalition, who thanked him for<br/>
speaking out on behalf of the river.   The local fish and wildlife<br/>
biologist was there and told him to come see him sometime and they&#39;d talk<br/>
about making healthy river habitat for fish and other little critters.  <br/>
<br/>
When I asked if he&#39;d like to stay longer he informed me that he had to<br/>
pee and the Simpsons were on and could we go home and get something to<br/>
eat.  <br/>
<br/>
Just the life of a ten year old. <br/>

I hope you&#39;re saving these posts somewhere for Dylan.  He&#39;s going to love<br/>
reading them someday, and so will whoever is lucky enough to have him for a<br/>
spouse.<br/>

but I did save the Poop movie titles and Star Wars Pants and now he&#39;s<br/>
saying very seriously &quot;I find your lack of pants disturbing&quot;, every time<br/>
I wear a skirt.  Perhaps it&#39;s time to shave the ol&#39; legs, eh?<br/>
