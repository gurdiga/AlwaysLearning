<div id="ygrps-yiv-791479142">Well Julie,  you tell ME if he looks like Springfield...I put our pic up.  I <br/>
like the pic of him because he has the three day stubble going, but I still <br/>
don&#39;t see the similarity.<br/>
<br/>
Cally, I get through Seattle every summer on my way to Alaska...maybe we <br/>
could meet for a quick bite or something? It all depends on how long the <br/>
layover is...last year it was overnight. My In laws usually come up and hang <br/>
out with us, they&#39;re great.<br/>
 <br/>
Glad you came out of lurkdom Tory.<br/>
And I&#39;m really upset that you burst my bubble Nanci!!! I was feeling like a <br/>
young&#39;un again. Well, I guess a 14 and 25 y.o. beat me out too...oh well, it <br/>
was a nice thought, being the youngest anywhere these days....sigh.<br/>
I am still the youngest consultant at work, I can hold onto that for a <br/>
while!!! haha<br/>
<br/>
I think we have a wonderful network of unschoolers spread out here...what a <br/>
road trip that&#39;d be!!<br/>
<br/>
And thank you Sandra, for the name of that magical little chapel. I <br/>
absolutely loved it there...so warm and inviting. That was the first time I <br/>
ever saw Holy water....having grown up in a home church I was a bit <br/>
sheltered. What do you think of the story about the staircase? I keep trying <br/>
to explain it and just can&#39;t figure out a logical explanation. Was it a true <br/>
miracle? Are they telling the truth about the scientific experiments on the <br/>
wood and the engineering of the staircase? It seems so fabulous.<br/>
Either way, we loved it there. Snowflakes swirling away outside, tramping <br/>
through town....I would love to go back. I was ready to move after that day.<br/>

Roy and I hitch a ride in that wonderful bus you drive?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Always welcome  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1775608893">&lt;&lt;Julie I saw your hair&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You just didn&#39;t see as much of it as you would&#39;ve if we&#39;d met a few years<br/>
ago.  I&#39;m actually thinking of getting checked out by a doctor.  My hair is<br/>
thinning, I&#39;m gaining weight, I&#39;m always tired, grumpier than usual (and<br/>
that&#39;s pretty grumpy &lt;grin&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking maybe hypothyroid or something.  Or maybe just getting older,<br/>
or maybe having a housefull of kids, or ...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-155637186">Oh.  You are beautiful, now.  Must ahve been STUNNING<br/>
&quot;a few years ago&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
I have gained between 50 and 60 pounds in the last 10<br/>
years. That&#39;s 5 pounds a year! I&#39;m 52.  &#39;Tis<br/>
irritating. <br/>
<br/>
Hope it is thyroid.  It can be fixed!!!(well,<br/>
depending) Simple blood test can tell you. However,<br/>
you do SO much, you may just be plain, ol&#39; tired. And<br/>
then there is the hormonal monkey jungle.<br/>
<br/>
SOS<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Those are classic symptoms of hypothyroid.  Get it checked.  When Lars was <br/>
around 2, I could hardly put one foot in front of the other.  Getting the <br/>
thyroid looked after helped a lot.  Unfortunately a few years after that <br/>
the fibromyalgia kicked in.  Fatigue has been my worst symptom of that as <br/>
well......sigh.<br/>
