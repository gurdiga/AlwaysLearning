<div id="ygrps-yiv-1205288570">Hi all! I&#39;m Karen, wife to Jeff, and Mommy to 4 wonderful kiddos. <br/>
Oldest 2 are 12 and 9. Little ones are babies. I just joined this <br/>
group simply because I have homeschooled for 6 yrs, am not quite <br/>
comfortable with any curriculum I&#39;ve used, but scared of unschooling <br/>
too. Textbook learning seems to be too much memorization, ace the <br/>
test, and forget it (which is the mail reason we hs in the first <br/>
place); therefore I don&#39;t like testing. I&#39;ve tried to be <br/>
an &quot;unschooler&quot; but I get too nervous that one day I&#39;ll regret that <br/>
they really needed certain knowledge that they just don&#39;t have. This <br/>
year we&#39;re doing a unit study, but we seem to be getting bogged down <br/>
with the &quot;have to learn&quot; stuff and aren&#39;t really enjoying it. We&#39;re <br/>
only on Day 10, so maybe I&#39;m not giving it a fair chance. I guess I <br/>
just want some reassurance that my gut feeling is correct (that they <br/>
only learn what they&#39;re interested in and the rest doesn&#39;t matter if <br/>
they know it or not). I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll just let them waste days and <br/>
not learn a thing!! Can anyone empathize with me? Surely there must <br/>
be someone out there! Do most unschoolers do math everyday and just <br/>
let the rest come when they&#39;re interested? And keep a daily journal? <br/>
Sorry this is so long, but this is just the group I&#39;ve been looking <br/>
for, I think. TIA for any info!!!</div>

<br/>
Um, nope, most unschoolers don&#39;t &quot;do math&quot; everyday.  (Although they<br/>
probably do use numbers every day, including Saturdays and Sundays.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1816978324">Hi hon,<br/>
So you&#39;re nervous.  Big deal.  EVERYONE gets nervous sometimes.  Nervous is <br/>
your mind&#39;s way of saying, What?  This is new!  What&#39;s this?  How&#39;s it <br/>
work? Huh?   How&#39;s that saying go...  A hero is a coward (ie, nervous <br/>
person) who forgot to stand still.  Being nervous doesn&#39;t make you wrong, <br/>
it only means you&#39;re doing something new and that you think something &#39;bad&#39; <br/>
will happen if you don&#39;t get it right.  (like maybe Ed McMahon decides to <br/>
NOT stop at your door with that big check.)<br/>
<br/>
Does it help to remind yourself that literacy was higher BEFORE <br/>
institutionalized schools (or Unit Studies) were in place?<br/>
<br/>
So, the Unit Study stuff doesn&#39;t seem to be working and maybe after 10 days <br/>
you haven&#39;t given it a fair chance...  after all, you say that you don&#39;t <br/>
want them to &#39;waste days and not learn a thing!!&#39;  I&#39;d have to agree with <br/>
you that y&#39;all should stop wasting any more time with that Unit Study thing <br/>
and let them finally get down to learning something interesting.  After <br/>
all, aren&#39;t 10 days enough to use up on that sort of thing?  If you don&#39;t <br/>
want to waste your money and you really like the thought of a Unit Study, <br/>
you could maybe do it yourself and leave your kids free to learn what <br/>
they&#39;re interested in.  Happiness all around! (grin)<br/>
<br/>
Okay, okay.  seriously.  You&#39;re not going to stop being nervous until <br/>
you&#39;ve actually jumped in and TRIED really unschooling and you finally see <br/>
that it really IS working for your kids.  And yes, it may take some time <br/>
for them to work out of your schoolishness.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody can give you the security you seek besides yourself.<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
Heidi<br/>
