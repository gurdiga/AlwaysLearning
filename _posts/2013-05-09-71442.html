<div id="ygrps-yiv-762695348">Thank you so much for sharing your:<br/>
- stories (which helped to put my situation in perspective and normalize my experience),<br/>
- strategies (which helped to give me lots of ideas to try and see what worked best),<br/>
- and, wisdom (which helped me grow as a mother, so I can apply this learning to more things than just diapers and clothes).<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had a much happier few weeks since reading all of the responses!<br/>
<br/>
We go clothing and diaper free when it&#39;s possible and appropriate, and when it&#39;s not we have been:<br/>
- changing on the go. As much as possible, no more interrupting what she&#39;s doing, or asking her to lie down. And since she likes yoga, I ask her to do downward dog and she happily does allowing me to clean her.<br/>
- I bring clothes with us and dress her either on the front porch, if it&#39;s too cold to make it to the car, or when we get there, or not at all if we&#39;re going someplace it&#39;s not inappropriate for her to just be in a diaper. And, I&#39;ve started letting go of my discomfort with the disapproving looks, tut tuts, and comments from strangers. My daughter&#39;s happiness is what matters, not their opinion.<br/>
- I&#39;ve minimized the outings we go on. Turns out she really does like to be home, and is in a phase where she doesn&#39;t need to go somewhere everyday. (I say phase only because she used to seem to need to get out of the house everyday to be happy.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m reading Playful Parenting, too, which is also helping a lot. Thanks to those who suggested it on this and previous threads. It&#39;s a very helpful book I can imagine reading several times throughout my daughter&#39;s life.<br/>
<br/>
I also keep trying to remember that she will continue to change and what works today may not work tomorrow. This helps me a bit in letting go of my attachment to things going smoothly.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m doing my best to try and get a little better at this everyday. Thanks again for your help!<br/>
<br/>
love, sarah<br/>
