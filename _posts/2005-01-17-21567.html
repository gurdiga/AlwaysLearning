-=-I&#39;ve  known kids in my life, when I was a kid, who could recognize <br/>
hundreds   <br/>
of different makes and models of cars!  When I was cruising a lot as  a  <br/>
teenager, I could tell what a car *wasn&#39;t* (wasn&#39;t the boy we were  chasing,  <br/>
etc.) by <br/>
the look of the headlights.  But hundreds of  models of cars?   No.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-It is an intelligence I do  not possess.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
That, the Power Rangers &quot;models&quot; details, etc. are (this surprised me) <br/>
&quot;Nature Intelligence,&quot; Howard Gardner&#39;s own added-later-to-the-set  <br/>
additional intelligence.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s what enables people to tell different kinds of trees, snakes, and  ants <br/>
apart.<br/>
 <br/>
Kirby recognized components of things.  Always and still.  But  when he was a <br/>
toddler, if we found a wooden peg or a screw or any little piece  of a thing <br/>
loose in the house, Kirby knew what it came off of.  And as  he got older, if <br/>
we found a game piece or a little plastic weapon from an action  figure or a <br/>
piece of plastic or the cover from the battery case of something, he  knew what <br/>
it was and where it went.<br/>
 <br/>
That skill stands him in good stead in his job at the gaming shop.   He knows <br/>
which little figures are for which games, and at a glance can tell  whether a <br/>
certain card (like for Magic or L5R kinds of CCG games)  is  current for <br/>
tournament play, what series it&#39;s from, etc.<br/>
 <br/>
Some more about nature intelligence is here, and more is easy to  find.<br/>
