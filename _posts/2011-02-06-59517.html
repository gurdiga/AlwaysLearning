<div id="ygrps-yiv-1709205334"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;People used to be *much* more inclined to violence and all sorts and more of widespread justification for violence. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s quite the same as it used to be.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;I&#39;m glad some things are harder to believe, things that used to be accepted.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Something dawned on me after I wrote that. The history of accepting<br/>
violence in my family, of ridicule and shame and belittling as the way<br/>
it is is still very much fresher and more real to my parent&#39;s<br/>
generation than to me or any of my siblings or the rest of our<br/>
generation. It will be even less of a reality for Karl&#39;s generation.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a good wakeup call. Each new generation is going to see these<br/>
things in a different light than the generations before have.<br/>
<br/>
I always thought my parents were mostly truthful, and that their<br/>
reactions were at times still too accepting and dull, and, at other<br/>
moments, too raw, by mirroring the way things were. Just as though it<br/>
were still going on and they had to fight it and everyone else too<br/>
along with it.<br/>
<br/>
That makes me a bit more understanding about why, as a kid, I had felt<br/>
they were unrealistic. The past was in their present, still very much<br/>
alive. I hope I can work through to the present day, and not live as<br/>
though the present isn&#39;t really the deal.<br/>
