<div id="ygrps-yiv-1446856288">-=-~~Okay, I forgot that ideas facts and thoughts are generally  <br/>
preferred<br/>
over feelings on this group. My only intention was to share another<br/>
perspective~~<br/>
<br/>
-=-that&#39;s because feelings are not reliable! feelings do not always  <br/>
express<br/>
the truth of the matter. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Right.  Others&#39; feelings won&#39;t really help me with my kids.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure something that&#39;s just &quot;a feeling&quot; even qualifies as  <br/>
&quot;perspective.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If there&#39;s nothing objective or logical about it, it&#39;s not  <br/>
&quot;perception&quot; in the way that a viewpoint and its relationship to the  <br/>
objects out there is a perception.  Feelings are involved in the  <br/>
analysis of perception.<br/>
<br/>
Ideas are what we can discuss.<br/>
<br/>
  Facts help sometimes, if what you mean by &quot;facts&quot; is gathered data  <br/>
and statistics.  Sometimes those facts just help us understand how to  <br/>
interpret weird &quot;statements of fact.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If someone says &quot;We got a horse,&quot; I would really like to trust that  <br/>
that is a fact.  It&#39;s not a creative writing list.  When I say &quot;Marty  <br/>
has a job,&quot; that&#39;s an absolute fact.  Those anecdotes of daily lives,  <br/>
the stories we share, are necessary to this kind of discussion.    <br/>
We&#39;re  not discussing the theories so much as we&#39;re showing how the  <br/>
theories play out in real ways.<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t share thoughts, just words.<br/>
<br/>
-=-If my daughter wants to have a<br/>
TV and she asks for one, then she&#39;ll get it. Just like she gets<br/>
raspberry popsicles when she wants one, even though I find them<br/>
repulsive and wouldnt have one myself.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If she knows you find them repulsive, as WE all know you find them  <br/>
repulsive, she will feel that she&#39;s eating something you wish she  <br/>
wasn&#39;t eating.  That&#39;s not good for digestion.  That&#39;s not good for  <br/>
mother-love.  That&#39;s not good for ANYthing, really.  Can&#39;t you take  <br/>
joy in the fact that she likes them?   Could you take joy in her  <br/>
enjoyment of TV?<br/>
<br/>
-=-I&#39;m just a parent who is genuinely committed to unschooling, and I<br/>
join these groups for support and learning. I didnt come here to<br/>
criticize you, there&#39;s no need to be so defensive.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a hard concept to consider, but this isn&#39;t a support group, in  <br/>
the traditional sense.   People here will support you becoming more  <br/>
mindful on your daughter&#39;s behalf, and will help you learn more about  <br/>
unschooling, but few will support your desire to defend your personal  <br/>
traumas and fears.  Undo them!  Examine them.  Lay them out to dry.   <br/>
Don&#39;t save them and recite them and justify them.  That advice is for  <br/>
your daughter&#39;s sake first, for unschooling&#39;s sake, but it WILL  <br/>
benefit you.  If you think of your daughter first, the benefit to you  <br/>
will be huge.  If you think of your own feelings and revulsions  <br/>
first, it will harm you, her, the relationship you could share, and  <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I didnt come here to criticize you, there&#39;s no need to be so  <br/>
defensive.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not about me.  My family&#39;s unschooling life is securely thriving.<br/>
I WILL defend unschooling.  I will defend those things that make it  <br/>
work, and when things that don&#39;t help are brought to this list, I  <br/>
will shine a light on them if someone else doesn&#39;t beat me to it.<br/>
<br/>
I will defend the time people spend helping others here, and will  <br/>
defend the integrity of the list and of my site.  It&#39;s not personal,  <br/>
it&#39;s philosophical.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1292193046">okay, <br/>
I DID say that I feel TV is evil, but I ALSO qualified that by saying<br/>
not &quot;evil&quot; in the &quot;devil&quot; sense, but just something bad for me,<br/>
personally.  Not bad for anyone else, not bad for my daughter, not bad<br/>
for unschooling.  Sorry if anyone here assumed that was what I meant.<br/>
<br/>
I DID point out that I realised (too late) that I shouldn&#39;t really be<br/>
posting feelings here in that way.<br/>
<br/>
I definately NEVER said that I project anything onto my daughter if<br/>
she eats popsicles or anything else for that matter, just that *I*<br/>
personally wouldnt eat them.  I also dont like Brussels Sprouts ;-)  I<br/>
eat a bunch of things my daughter doesn&#39;t like, she doesn&#39;t have to<br/>
eat them.  and vice versa, no issue.<br/>
<br/>
SO:<br/>
my question is: Is is really such an &quot;unschooling no-no&quot; to have a<br/>
home without a TV?<br/>
<br/>
To be honest, I dont think it is, I have a long experience living in<br/>
the third world and seen loads of families who are &quot;unschooling&quot;<br/>
without calling it that.  They&#39;re all just doing what everyone did<br/>
before universal schooling was invented.  and the vast majority of<br/>
them do NOT have TV.  many dont even have electricity, let alone<br/>
computers with internet access.  Many of these kids, without any<br/>
school, speak half a dozen languages, read and write, and have skills<br/>
that astound me (like that 4 year old who drives in India).<br/>
<br/>
Even here in the West, lots of families dont have a computer at home,<br/>
they have to go to their local library to get online, they dont have <br/>
 a swimming pool, they have to make do with the public one, they dont<br/>
have a yard with a garden or an encyclopedia or a lot of books or all<br/>
kinds of things.  They get this stuff outside the home, and that<br/>
doesnt mean it&#39;s being &quot;restricted&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
So that&#39;s where I&#39;m at now, I am, in all honesty, open to hear your<br/>
responses.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-830961625">-=-many dont even have electricity, let alone<br/>
computers with internet access. Many of these kids, without any<br/>
school, speak half a dozen languages-=-<br/>
<br/>
People spoke long before schools were invented.<br/>
Schools have rarely helped ANYone learn a language.  They  have  <br/>
caused millions of people to endure two years or more of conjugation  <br/>
of verbs and writing out dialogs about where the library is, but  <br/>
that&#39;s &quot;studying a language,&quot; not learning to speak it in any real- <br/>
world way.<br/>
<br/>
Kids could learn languages more easily from DVDs now than they could  <br/>
from school.<br/>
<br/>
-=-not &quot;evil&quot; in the &quot;devil&quot; sense-=-<br/>
<br/>
What kind of sense then?  Please define evil not in the devil sense.<br/>
And if you have to look it up to do that, please remember that any  <br/>
and every word you use has a dictionary definition and it&#39;s not okay  <br/>
to say later &quot;I didn&#39;t mean that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You can choose your worse as carefully as you want to, but if you  <br/>
choose some and post them here others will assume (sensibly and  <br/>
rightly) that you intended to read feedback on what you posted.<br/>
<br/>
-=I DID point out that I realised (too late) that I shouldn&#39;t really be<br/>
posting feelings here in that way.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If by feelings you mean thoughts, post all you want.<br/>
If by feelings you mean bullshit, don&#39;t post that stuff.<br/>
Just don&#39;t post anything you don&#39;t want to defend or that you don&#39;t  <br/>
want discussed.<br/>
<br/>
Those things, you can write on paper and tape to the wall at your  <br/>
house  What is sent to this list, though, is ours to dissect and play  <br/>
around with.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I definately NEVER said that I project anything onto my daughter if<br/>
she eats popsicles or anything else for that matter, just that *I*<br/>

<br/>
In this case, sorry to say, it doesn&#39;t matter what you said or what  <br/>
you would like to claim you wish you had said or thought you were  <br/>
saying.  If your daughter is aware in any way that you disapprove of  <br/>
her choices, you are doing emotional damage.  If she knows because  <br/>
she overheard  you, or you breathed in and out in a meaningful way,  <br/>
or rolled your eyes, or said &quot;Do you REALLY want to watch this?&quot; or  <br/>
&quot;Ugh&quot; or any of a thousand ways you could indicate negative thoughts  <br/>
or feelings, it doesn&#39;t matter one bit what you write here to try to  <br/>
convince us you didn&#39;t say you had done that.<br/>
<br/>
-=-SO:<br/>
my question is: Is is really such an &quot;unschooling no-no&quot; to have a<br/>
home without a TV?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the question anymore.<br/>
<br/>
The questions are bigger and broader than that.<br/>
<br/>
-=-To be honest, I dont think it-=-<br/>
<br/>
Then there&#39;s your answer.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I have a long experience living in<br/>
the third world and seen loads of families who are &quot;unschooling&quot;<br/>
without calling it that. They&#39;re all just doing what everyone did<br/>
before universal schooling was invented. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Living a subsistance life in poverty, maybe without a family and  <br/>
maybe without a house, is not &quot;unschooling without calling it that.&quot;   <br/>
If you think no more of unschooing than that, please read everything  <br/>
here before you post anymore.<br/>

Deschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Sandra, I needed the reminder. A friend stopped by yesterday,  <br/>
with a whole box of homeschooling books. She&#39;s going to HS her son  <br/>
this year, he has backsurgery in September and will be flat on his  <br/>
back for maybe two months, and then restricted movement for another  <br/>
few. I talked to her a bit about just living life (he has degeorge  <br/>
syndrome, and is &#39;behind&#39; on school work) and she seemed to think it  <br/>
was a good idea, esp after I pointed out that she said he learns  <br/>
better by doing!<br/>
<br/>
But after she left, I was thinking about all those nifty worksheets  <br/>
(which Emily and I personally love doing). Fortunately the kids were  <br/>
at a friends house swimming, and I was able to breath and talk myself  <br/>
through it ;-)  I know I have a lot of work to do on *my*  <br/>
deschooling. The kids are there! Our house is so awesome, and I love  <br/>
that we sit and watch TV and play video games, and dig up clay, and  <br/>
build houses out of cornstalks, and paint the table, and a bunch of  <br/>
other things we&#39;ve done just today.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think a better question is &quot;Am I expanding or contracting my  <br/>
child&#39;s world by what I&#39;m doing?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that kids can&#39;t learn without TV. Kids have been learning  <br/>
ever since their only toys were sticks and rocks!<br/>
<br/>
There are unschoolers who live beyond the range of decent TV  <br/>
reception. There&#39;s a whole world of options that aren&#39;t TV. And we  <br/>
can talk about options for bringing the world to kids when broadcast  <br/>
isn&#39;t available.<br/>
<br/>
But, when TV is available, when *parents* make the conscious choice  <br/>
not to bring it into their homes, it is the same as deciding not to  <br/>
use books or not to use the internet or not to go to plays. It&#39;s  <br/>
deliberately cutting off a resource.<br/>
<br/>
And a secondary effect is that *when parents think TV is bad*, it&#39;s  <br/>
very difficult for children not to pick up that message. No matter  <br/>
how careful the parents are. No matter how much they insist that if  <br/>
the child asks for it, they&#39;ll get a TV. The child *can&#39;t* freely  <br/>
choose TV without knowingly choosing something she knows her parents  <br/>
think is bad.<br/>
<br/>
Same goes for non-organic food. Other religions. Plastic. Anything  <br/>
the parents have decided is *bad*, that they don&#39;t for themselves  <br/>
want in the house, can&#39;t be freely chosen by a child.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not an absolute pronouncement that every parent who feels  <br/>
uncomfortable about TV will have children who feel uncomfortable  <br/>
about watching it. But the atmosphere is there, nonetheless. And it  <br/>
takes a lot of extra, special interaction to counteract the message  <br/>
the parents are silently sending.<br/>
<br/>
So it isn&#39;t truthful to say &quot;Yes, you can choose not to have TV and  <br/>
your child will grow up without picking up your fears and will be  <br/>
just as knowledgeable as those who have free access.&quot; You&#39;re creating  <br/>
a situation that is likely to lead to a child feeling she can&#39;t  <br/>
freely choose TV when she wants. Can you counteract that? It will  <br/>
entirely depend on your awareness and sensitivity of your daughter,  <br/>
your awareness of yourself impact and your ability to counteract what  <br/>
you&#39;re creating. It will be dependent on your personalities and your  <br/>
environment.<br/>
<br/>
We can help you see what the world looks like from your child&#39;s point  <br/>
of view. We can help you create an environment of freedom. But we  <br/>
can&#39;t help you counteract a deliberate limiting of your child&#39;s  <br/>
world. That&#39;s work you&#39;ll have to do yourself because what&#39;s needed  <br/>
-- if it&#39;s possible -- will entirely depend on the personalities and  <br/>
abilities in your family.<br/>

<br/>
I live so close to decent reception that we don&#39;t have cable, which  <br/>
seems to some of the other unschoolers like we&#39;re watching sticks and  <br/>
rocks. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
&quot;At this very instant the young fairy came out from behind the  <br/>
hangings, and spake these words aloud: &quot;Assure yourselves, O King and  <br/>
Queen, that your daughter shall not die of this disaster. It is true,  <br/>
I have no power to undo entirely what my elder has done. The princess  <br/>
shall indeed pierce her hand with a spindle; but, instead of dying,  <br/>
she shall only fall into a profound sleep, which shall last a hundred  <br/>
years, at the expiration of which a king&#39;s son shall come and awake  <br/>
her.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So like in Sleeping Beauty, we can be the eleven fairies (or seven,  <br/>
depending on the version you like) and we can help you find beauty,  <br/>
music, kindness, peace, art... but we can&#39;t undo the curse of  <br/>
negativity.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t make your child wait 100 years or until a prince chops down a  <br/>
thorny hedge, or even until she&#39;s fifteen to have as full and free a  <br/>
life as she can have.<br/>
<br/>
We would like for you to live happily ever after (starting now, I mean).<br/>

this one. When you said &quot;tv is evil,&quot; I understood you didn&#39;t mean in  <br/>
the &quot;devil&quot; sense, but, instead, in the usual sense of the word  <br/>
meaning extremely malevolent and harmful.<br/>
<br/>
As for whether or not you can unschool without a tv? Sure.  But tv&#39;s  <br/>
are inexpensive and offer a more glorious and bountiful window to a  <br/>
wider world than any other resource, so to choose not to have one  <br/>
because you think it is &quot;evil,&quot; is not a particularly &quot;create-a-rich- <br/>
environment&quot; kind of unschooling parent approach.<br/>
<br/>
Also, people &quot;can&quot; live without all kinds of things. My husband grew  <br/>
up with literally only one toy - he received one small toy bear as a  <br/>
gift and that was the ONLY toy he ever had. He played in the  <br/>
countryside with rocks and sticks and he had a wonderful childhood.  <br/>
So, should we have decided to let our children have only one toy? Why  <br/>
should we decide to deprive our children, on purpose, of wonderful  <br/>
joy-bringing things - things we can afford?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-322834224">All rightey!<br/>
I&#39;m learning a LOT here, and after all, that&#39;s what I&#39;m here for.<br/>
<br/>
So, in the hopes that there&#39;s not gonna be too many future<br/>
mis-interpretations and such, as are prone to come up when relative<br/>
strangers are communicating through electronic printed words, I shall<br/>
bare a bit of my soul and give you a little intro and background from<br/>
my life...<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is 3 1/3 years old (3.3).  I am 27.<br/>
I have definately never considered the idea of sending my daughter to<br/>
school of any kind for more than the split-second it took me to see<br/>
that I&#39;m sure its a waste of her time, intelligence, passion, spirit,<br/>
learning potential, etc.  I said as much to her dad before she was<br/>
born.  I did consider homeschooling, in some natural alternative kinda<br/>
way, without knowing anything much about that, but didnt really give<br/>
it much thought as I figured, I&#39;ve got 5 or 6 years before that<br/>
becomes an issue.<br/>
<br/>
Then I heard about unschooling, and I instantly knew, yep, that&#39;s what<br/>
we&#39;re gonna do, and I realised that we are, in fact, ALREADY doing it.<br/>
<br/>
My dd has her freedom.  I dont &quot;allow&quot; her to take it, or &quot;give&quot; it to<br/>
her, I just dont stand in her way.  I do insist that we dont drive<br/>
unless she&#39;s in her seat belt, but that generally means that I sit and<br/>
wait patiently trying to find creative solutions to help her to be<br/>
happy in the seat belt on times that she&#39;s not into it, rather than<br/>
forcing her into it.  (ie, what if I tell you a story while you&#39;re in<br/>
your seat, or what if we paint your seat belt with nice colours? etc)<br/>
<br/>
My dd chooses what she eats when she eats it, she chooses what she<br/>
wears, (even if its nothing, though I do insist on sunscreen or<br/>
staying indoors if that&#39;s her choice). She goes to be when she is<br/>
sleepy, and wakes up when she likes, I often find myself tired and<br/>
leave her playing on the internet or watching DVDs while I go to bed.<br/>
 She is free to come to sleep when she likes.  She nursed on demand<br/>
24/7 until she was 2 years 7 months, and she stopped very easily, by<br/>
herself.  I&#39;m a SAHM, I work a few hours a week from home.<br/>
<br/>
There are no punishments or discipline in our home, and likewise no<br/>
rewards.  I often bring my dd presents, just because I saw something<br/>
that she would like and I felt like getting it.  Sometimes a present<br/>
can be something as simple as a piece of junk mail with a nice picture<br/>
of a butterfly on it.  I take her with me most places, I let her work<br/>
the ATM for me, help me fill in forms, interact with sales people and<br/>
office clerks, or just sit on the floor hanging in the background, or<br/>
whatever, as she feels.  Its all life and its all learning.  I admit,<br/>
at this age I&#39;m still not comfortable about leaving her home alone, so<br/>
if she doesn&#39;t want to go where I&#39;m going, again, I spend time<br/>
patiently working with her to find a solution, maybe we just go later.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday our next-door neighbour was doing some home-improvement and<br/>
there was a lot of loud banging.  My dd came to me and said she was<br/>
afraid of the noise.  I gave her a hug and we talked about it for a<br/>
bit.  In then end, we came up with the idea to go next door and see<br/>
what the noise is.  So we went, knocked on the door, explained<br/>
ourselves, saw what the guy was doing.  We examined his hammer and<br/>
other tools and stuff.  Then we went home, dd no longer afraid, and<br/>
very curious about woodwork.  So I got our a hammer and an old cut-off<br/>
piece of wood and nails and we played with that for a while.  then I<br/>
had an idea and hammered nails about a cm apart all along 2<br/>
perpendicular edges of the wood and then we wove string in and out<br/>
creating patterns.  Then I left dd alone to explore with the wood,<br/>
hammer, nails, string, and the whole tool cupboard and went to the<br/>
kitchen.  When she wanted some help, she called me...<br/>
<br/>
This is a pretty typical example of how our days go.  I&#39;m still pretty<br/>
new to the idea of &quot;UNSCHOOLING&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I dont have a TV.  I do have a problem with TV, in the same way<br/>
that some have a probelm with alcohol. I had a quite abusive childhood<br/>
and spent much of my teenage years heavily addicted to Heroin. I<br/>
managed to clean myself up, put some physical distance between myself<br/>
and my family and turn my life around. Still, if I get in front of a<br/>
TV, I have a very hard time excersising the restraint and will-power<br/>
needed to get away from it. I am working on healing this within<br/>
myself, healing and moving on from the past traumas and I find new joy<br/>
in my life every day.  But for now I feel that for me the best thing<br/>
is not to have a TV in the house, the same way that alcoholics choose<br/>
not to have alcohol in their homes when they choose to heal themselves.<br/>
<br/>
If my dd asks for a TV, she can have one, she can keep it in her room<br/>
and watch to her heart&#39;s content.  At some point I will be able to<br/>
watch with her in a healthy way.  I&#39;m working on it.<br/>
<br/>
When I asked if it is impossible to unschool without TV, and said that<br/>
I dont think it is, I was genuinely opening myself up to the<br/>
possibility that in order to succesfully unschool, we need TV, not to<br/>
debate it, just to hear others&#39; opinions, facts, experiences, that<br/>
kind of stuff.  I read so many stories about how so many unschoolers<br/>
are watching unlimited TV and how parents who limit TV are not on the<br/>
best path... I was wondering if anyone had experience from the other side.<br/>
<br/>
I am not limiting my dd from watching TV, as I said in an earlier<br/>
post, she if free to watch as much as she likes in places where it is<br/>
available, as well as being free to watch whatever DVDs or download<br/>
whatever shows she likes.  She plays around a lot on the internet, she<br/>
has no problem manipulating the mouse and knows how to navigate to<br/>
different sites, she likes www.poissonrouge.com and the teletubbies<br/>
sites a lot.  she knows how to open a paint or word document and play<br/>
around typing.  She knows ther ABCs in English and Hebrew and the<br/>
positions of the keys, and the functions of SHIFT and DEL etc.  I<br/>
haven&#39;t &quot;taught&quot; her any of this, she worked it out herself, by<br/>
watching me and having the freedom to work it out, and the confidence<br/>
to ask when she has a question.  <br/>

The background information is interesting but it won&#39;t prevent the  <br/>
need for being as clear as you can be when you&#39;re writing, and for  <br/>
knowing that the purpose of the list is to examine ideas.<br/>
<br/>
-=-okay, again, Sandra, you have made an assumption way off the mark. No<br/>

in poverty without a family?-=-<br/>
<br/>
1930 didn&#39;t necessarily mean poverty either, but to say &quot;During the  <br/>
Depression&quot; is often shorthand for the reminder that people tended to  <br/>
be hungry, unemployed, and maybe dying of fever.<br/>
<br/>
Saying &quot;Pioneer days&quot; doesn&#39;t necessarily mean poverty either, but  <br/>
once that phrase is used, the reasonable assumption is that nobody&#39;s  <br/>
talking about a family living in a large stone house that&#39;s been  <br/>
there 300 years, with hundred year old trees and their great- <br/>
grandparents&#39; souvenirs in a trunk upstairs.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re going to cling to what you meant to write instead of  <br/>
accepting that what you post WILL be interpretted by people who see  <br/>
it and respond to it, I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll enjoy this list.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I was talking about children who have loving homes, large extended<br/>

Children who learn by watching and being a part of the world around<br/>
them. -=-<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t live there, though, nor does your daughter.  I&#39;m not sure  <br/>
anyone does.  Do you have a real-life place in mind, or is this an  <br/>
idealized fantasy world?  That&#39;s a serious question you should ask  <br/>
yourself, but you don&#39;t need to answer it on the list.<br/>
<br/>
As to  -=- Children ... who<br/>
aren&#39;t &quot;seen and not heard&quot; or banished to play-rooms and day-care.<br/>
Children who learn by watching and being a part of the world around<br/>
them,-=-   you&#39;re not talking about unschoolers, either.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes we do mention mainstream modern western culture.  MOSTLY we  <br/>
need to talk about unschoolers.  Those without any real unschooling  <br/>
experience can ask questions or tell applicable stories, but it&#39;s  <br/>
less helpful for those without any real unschooling experience not to  <br/>
tell us what we could be doing better or how unschooling can or does  <br/>
or should work.<br/>
<br/>
Contrary to warm feelings, nursing a baby isn&#39;t the same as  <br/>
unschooling.  Nursing a baby is a great thing!  Attachment parenting  <br/>
is a great thing.  Being a gentle, attentive parent is a great  <br/>
thing.  All of those have aspects that will make unschooling easier  <br/>
to do, but they are not the things that happen after a family decides  <br/>
not to put a child in school at compulsory school age, or at the age  <br/>
all their neighbors are putting the toddlers into academic pre-schools.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My dd has her freedom. I dont &quot;allow&quot; her to take it, or &quot;give&quot; it to<br/>
her, I just dont stand in her way-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s your decision to make, and so you give it to her.  If you and  <br/>
your husband die, her freedom goes with you.  Constructs that don&#39;t  <br/>
reflect reality aren&#39;t helpful to people.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I do insist that we dont drive<br/>
unless she&#39;s in her seat belt, but that generally means that I sit and<br/>
wait patiently trying to find creative solutions to help her to be<br/>
happy in the seat belt on times that she&#39;s not into it, rather than<br/>
forcing her into it. (ie, what if I tell you a story while you&#39;re in<br/>
your seat, or what if we paint your seat belt with nice colours? etc)-=-<br/>
<br/>
Do you let adult passengers decide whether to wear their seatbelts?   <br/>
Do you offer to tell them stories?  Again, not a question to answer  <br/>
on the list, just to consider in light of principles and how they  <br/>
operate in regular life.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I admit,<br/>
at this age I&#39;m still not comfortable about leaving her home alone, so<br/>
if she doesn&#39;t want to go where I&#39;m going...-=-<br/>
<br/>
Do you seriously think, even a teensy bit, that anyone on this list  <br/>
leaves a three year old home alone?<br/>
A four or five year old?<br/>
<br/>
-=-I do have a problem with TV, in the same way<br/>
that some have a probelm with alcohol. I had a quite abusive childhood<br/>
and spent much of my teenage years heavily addicted to Heroin.-=-<br/>
<br/>
But those things are not between your daughter and her need for input  <br/>
and exposure to ideas, voices, music, stories.   Heroin didn&#39;t make  <br/>
you watch TV, nor did TV make you use heroin.  If you have any  <br/>
thoughts like that in your mind, please consider counseling.  If your  <br/>
past traumas are all mixed up in you and you have healing to do  <br/>
that&#39;s keeping you from seeing clearly, the best thing you could do  <br/>
for your daughter would be to untangle as much of that confusion and  <br/>
fear as you can, as soon as possible.<br/>
<br/>
-=-But for now I feel that for me the best thing<br/>
is not to have a TV in the house, the same way that alcoholics choose<br/>
not to have alcohol in their homes when they choose to heal  <br/>
themselves.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think it belittles alcoholism to compare it to a $100 appliance--a  <br/>
radio with pictures.  I have a friend who just wrote to me with this:<br/>
<br/>
I JUST PLAN TO LIVE IT OUT HERE IN THIS BEAUTI-<br/>
FUL PLACE AND STICK WITH MY A.A. MEETINGS.  I<br/>
GOT SOBER HERE 12/23/76 AND A GREAT BUNCH OF<br/>
US FROM BACK THEN ARE STILL AROUND AND GLAD<br/>
I AM BACK.  A.A. IN NASHVILLE IS WONDERFUL TOO<br/>
BUT IT WAS JUST TIME TO COME HOME IN SPITE OF<br/>
HAVING NO CENTRAL VISION AND THE BLOOD AND<br/>
BONE MARROW CANCER THAT SENT ME AWAT FROM<br/>
THIS THIN AIR AND TOO HIGH FOR ME ALTITUDE.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t compare TV to alcoholism.  Alcohol doesn&#39;t have a remote  <br/>
control with a mute and an off switch.  For her to be going to  <br/>
meetings still after nearly 30 years, to have been sober for nearly  <br/>
30 years, is a remarkable achievement and a LOT of work.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I am not limiting my dd from watching TV, as I said in an earlier<br/>
post, she if free to watch as much as she likes in places where it is<br/>

whatever shows she likes.-=-<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s not all that much on the internet to download, I don&#39;t  <br/>
think.  She can&#39;t go visiting by herself, as she&#39;s three.  Do you  <br/>
have an example of a place she&#39;s ever been where she could watch as  <br/>
much TV as she likes?  Do you ever leave her at anyone else&#39;s house?   <br/>
She&#39;s three.<br/>
<br/>
What if someone wrote  &quot;I am not limiting my dd from looking at  <br/>
books. She is free to read as much as she likes in places where books  <br/>
are available, as well as being free to order whatever books she  <br/>
likes from Amazon or interlibrary loan....&quot; others might well ask how  <br/>
she would even know which end of a book was up, or how she might go  <br/>
about browsing Amazon.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If my dd asks for a book, she can have one, she can keep it in her room<br/>
and read to her heart&#39;s content. At some point I will be able to<br/>
read with her in a healthy way. I&#39;m working on it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How long would you wait to work on it if you felt unable to share  <br/>
books with her?<br/>

<br/>
To be honest, I dont think it is, I have a long experience living in<br/>
the third world and seen loads of families who are &quot;unschooling&quot;<br/>
without calling it that.  They&#39;re all just doing what everyone did<br/>
before universal schooling was invented.  and the vast majority of<br/>
them do NOT have TV.  many dont even have electricity, let alone<br/>
computers with internet access.  Many of these kids, without any<br/>
school, speak half a dozen languages, read and write, and have skills<br/>
that astound me (like that 4 year old who drives in India).<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yeah---but is that where *you* live? If I lived there, I would make my <br/>
children&#39;s worlds as big as I could *there*---without tv or video games <br/>
or electricity even. But I don&#39;t. I live where all that stuff is <br/>
readily available. It&#39;s common, and it&#39;s stuff they like. I&#39;m not going <br/>
to deprive them of something I&#39;m not wild about but that&#39;s readily <br/>
available.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like peas. I DO make them available for my boys because they <br/>
like them. There&#39;s almost always a can in the cupboard or a frozen <br/>
package in the freezer. It&#39;s available.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like Jazz, but I buy jazz CDs and DVDs and go to jazz bars with <br/>
my son because *he* likes them. I don&#39;t like cycling, but I bought my <br/>
husband his first bike (well, his first &quot;big boy&quot; bike! &lt;G&gt;), and I <br/>
SAGed him and a friend when they went cycling the Natchez Trace last <br/>
spring. I don&#39;t like Manga or ANime, but I buy and read Manga books to <br/>
my younger son, I bought him a costume to wear at the CosPlay funshop, <br/>
and I painted his room in YuGiOh! characters.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Even here in the West, lots of families dont have a computer at home,<br/>
they have to go to their local library to get online, they dont have<br/>
 a swimming pool, they have to make do with the public one, they dont<br/>
have a yard with a garden or an encyclopedia or a lot of books or all<br/>
kinds of things.  They get this stuff outside the home, and that<br/>
doesnt mean it&#39;s being &quot;restricted&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
*WHY* do they not have a computer? Because they can&#39;t afford it or <br/>
because they are afraid of the gamma rays?<br/>
*WHY* do they not have a swimming pool? Because they can&#39;t afford it or <br/>
they live where it&#39;s impractical or because pools have sharks?<br/>
*WHY* do  they not have a garden? Because they couldn&#39;t afford a house <br/>
with a yard and garden or because gardens attract giant  grasshoppers?<br/>
*WHY* do they not have encyclopedias---wait---Does *anyone* have <br/>
encyclopedias any more? &lt;Bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The things IS: tv is soooo inexpensive. I can see not being able to <br/>
afford a very high end computer, but there are plenty of old, cheap, or <br/>
rebuilt ones for a song. Pools? HUGE expense---even if it came with the <br/>
house. Yards and gardens? Lots of work and $$$ to maintain. <br/>
Encyclopedias? Sorry---still laughing. &lt;g&gt; But tv is CHEAP. Really <br/>
cheap.<br/>
<br/>
The other stuff you mentioned can easily be excused with high cost. Tvs <br/>
are cheap and an *excellent* way to receive information. We don&#39;t live <br/>
where things like tv are cost-prohibitive. Cheap, cheap, cheap!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 They get this stuff outside the home, and that<br/>
doesnt mean it&#39;s being &quot;restricted&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Sure. But are they *afraid* of those things? Third world doesn&#39;t always <br/>
mean abject poverty---mostly is, but certainly not always---but it&#39;s <br/>
the FEAR FACTOR that&#39;s stopping you from having a TV.<br/>
<br/>
People are terrified that if they had unlimited access to M&Ms that <br/>
they would ONLY eat M&Ms. I have a challenge that several people have <br/>
taken me up on with incredible results: put a *large* bowl of M&Ms on <br/>
you kitchen counter or in your foyer. Keep it FULL! You may need to <br/>
have a drawer with 2-3 more bags nearby so that it&#39;s never, ever even <br/>
half empty (or half-full---however you like to visualize it! &lt;G&gt;). <br/>
Chances are, the M&Ms will be quickly devoured the first few days. Keep <br/>
it FULL, and I promise your consumption of M&Ms to go waaaay down to <br/>
next to nothing by the end of a month. I have two huge bowls out in my <br/>
foyer now---one with plain and peanut. One with dark chocolate M&Ms. I <br/>
haven&#39;t had one in days and days and days. My guests this week couldn&#39;t <br/>
stop eating them! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know that&#39;s not TV, but at the same time, you could do that too. Get <br/>
your absolute fill of TV---24/7. Eventually, you will not have that <br/>
intense attraction. But I won&#39;t recommend that you try that with a <br/>
three year old in the house---she needs you too much! &lt;G&gt; I suggest <br/>
that with teens and with childless adults who feel that it is <br/>
addictive. It&#39;s NOT. *YOU* get to choose. You really do. There&#39;s <br/>
nothing on TV that can *make* you watch. Nothing.<br/>
<br/>
You think it has some kind of control of you. It&#39;s because you&#39;ve <br/>
denied yourself TV for so long. When you turn it on, say, &quot;*I* get to <br/>
choose what to watch and when.&quot; It&#39;s a BOX! It doesn&#39;t have that <br/>
control. Only *YOU* do. ONLY YOU!<br/>
<br/>
The restriction problem comes in the idea that it scares you. She&#39;ll <br/>
pick up on that. She&#39;ll know you&#39;re fearing sometihng that she finds <br/>
delight in. She&#39;s small enough to have difficulty <br/>
understanding/comprehending that dichotomy.<br/>
<br/>
Lose the fear. It&#39;s a BOX! *YOU* are the all-powerful OZ! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hell, you kicked HEROIN! You&#39;re scared of a damned box??? &lt;G&gt;<br/>

If that other kid goes to school, he&#39;s been told for years to leave  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-80090210">-=-Is there a situation where you could see it being a potential  <br/>
problem?-=-<br/>
<br/>
What kind of answer do you want?<br/>
<br/>
If you want rules, you came to the wrong list!<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/rules">http://sandradodd.com/rules</a><br/>
<br/>
There is no rule on earth that will keep a kid safe.  If your child  <br/>
is 13.5 and you find friends who were born the same day, will they be  <br/>
&quot;safer&quot; than someone born three years earlier?  three yeard later?<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s sexual maturity you&#39;re worried about, that doesn&#39;t come on  <br/>
any schedule whatsoever.<br/>
<br/>
Do you want a guarantee that the other kid isn&#39;t jumpstarted by  <br/>
sexual molestation?    Some people don&#39;t even realize or remember for  <br/>
years.   If Holly makes a friend today, he might be abused over the  <br/>
weekend.<br/>
<br/>
There are no guarantees.<br/>
<br/>
Making rules only reduces people&#39;s ability to use good judgment and  <br/>
gives them the false impression that rules create safety or that  <br/>
choices and good judgment can be avoided.<br/>

I have lived.  You do know that I lived for a long time in the third<br/>
world, I did say when I first brought it up in a previous post, which<br/>
you quoted from, &quot;I have a long experience living in the third world<br/>
and seen loads of families...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When i made this comment I was talking about real people in real<br/>
places that I have been to.  I&#39;m mentioning specifically families I<br/>
spent time with in Lesotho in Africa, in Laos in South East Asia and<br/>
in Brazil. I was living in such an environment in Brazil when my<br/>
daughter was born.  I spent 5 years living in various places in the<br/>
third world.  Right now we live in Israel (currently trying to bomb<br/>
itself into the thrid world ;) (and just to make sure its clear, that<br/>
 was a joke) )<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, I was comparing these wonderful children to the &quot;stereotype<br/>
mainstream kids&quot;, thinking that it would highlight the similarity to<br/>
western unschoolers.<br/>
I really am under the impression that unschooling is not &#39;keeping kids<br/>
from school&#39; (although unschoolers do not go to school), but allowing<br/>
them to learn how/ what/ when they like at their own pace.  Being<br/>
there 100% to support them without getting in the way.  Letting them<br/>
involve themselves in real life. Providing a loving and nurturing<br/>
home. In a nutshell.<br/>
<br/>
That is what these families I mentioned are doing. That is what I am<br/>
doing, as best I can.<br/>

&quot;but it&#39;s less helpful for those without any real unschooling<br/>
experience not to tell us what we could be doing better or how<br/>
unschooling can or does or should work.<br/>
Did you mis-type one negative too many?  I assume the &quot;not&quot; that comes<br/>
between &quot;experience&quot; and &quot;to tell&quot; shouldnt be there.  help me out<br/>
here if I&#39;m wrong.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m working my way through reading everything at Sandradodd.com, as<br/>
well as everything I can get my hands on from Holt (difficult in<br/>
Israel, most online booksellers (including Amazon) wont ship out of<br/>
print books here and I cant really afford to import books too much) as<br/>
well as anything else I can find on unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I agree that those with little experience shouldn&#39;t be doling out<br/>
advice on how to do things better or how unschooling works.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Contrary to warm feelings, nursing a baby isn&#39;t the same as  <br/>
&gt; unschooling.  Nursing a baby is a great thing!  Attachment parenting  <br/>
&gt; is a great thing.  Being a gentle, attentive parent is a great  <br/>
&gt; thing.  All of those have aspects that will make unschooling easier<br/>
&gt; to do, but they are not the things that happen after a family<br/>
&gt; decides not to put a child in school at compulsory school age, or at <br/>
&gt; the age all their neighbors are putting the toddlers into academic<br/>
&gt; pre-schools.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>hang on, Sorry, but I really dont understand what you mean by <br/>
&quot;All of those have aspects that will make unschooling easier to do,<br/>
but they are not the things that happen after a family decides not to<br/>
put a child in school at compulsory school age...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Could you perhaps rephrase or clarify this for me?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; -=-My dd has her freedom. I dont &quot;allow&quot; her to take it, or &quot;give&quot; it to<br/>
&gt; her, I just dont stand in her way-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That&#39;s your decision to make, and so you give it to her.  If you and  <br/>
&gt; your husband die, her freedom goes with you.  Constructs that don&#39;t  <br/>
&gt; reflect reality aren&#39;t helpful to people.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, so I&#39;m phrasing things wrong again... Learning to say it better,<br/>
to think about things differently.  <br/>
Why does my daughter&#39;s freedom go if I and her father die? <br/>
3 of her 4 grandparents are retired and they are very open to our<br/>
&quot;radical&quot; parenting ideas.  I have every reason to believe that if we<br/>
die, they will care for her with unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you let adult passengers decide whether to wear their seatbelts?   <br/>
&gt; Do you offer to tell them stories?  Again, not a question to answer  <br/>
&gt; on the list, just to consider in light of principles and how they  <br/>
&gt; operate in regular life.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What do you, as unschoolers do, if your toddlers refuse to wear their<br/>
seatbelts?  Is my GD method totally off-base?  <br/>
And actually, I do offer to tell stories to adults.  I used to be a<br/>
travelling story-teller, before I had my dd. (though to be honest, the<br/>
situation of an adult refusing to wear a seat-belt never came up)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you seriously think, even a teensy bit, that anyone on this list  <br/>
&gt; leaves a three year old home alone?<br/>
&gt; A four or five year old?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do you seriously think that I think that? I was merely pointing out<br/>
that there are some things that my dd actually *doesnt* have &quot;freedom&quot;<br/>
in.  if we drive, she MUST wear a seat belt.  If I go out, she MUST<br/>
come with me.  I just do my best to make these MUSTs happen without<br/>
forcing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If you have any  <br/>
&gt; thoughts like that in your mind, please consider counseling.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I DON&#39;T have thoughts like that, and I am seeing a therapist.  Its<br/>
helping a lot.<br/>
<br/>
  If your  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; past traumas are all mixed up in you and you have healing to do  <br/>
&gt; that&#39;s keeping you from seeing clearly, the best thing you could do  <br/>
&gt; for your daughter would be to untangle as much of that confusion and  <br/>
&gt; fear as you can, as soon as possible.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As I said, I am working on it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; -=-But for now I feel that for me the best thing<br/>
&gt; is not to have a TV in the house, the same way that alcoholics choose<br/>
&gt; not to have alcohol in their homes when they choose to heal  <br/>
&gt; themselves.-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think it belittles alcoholism to compare it to a $100 appliance--a  <br/>
&gt; radio with pictures. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, you think that, But I dont. I have a problem.  Alcohol doesnt<br/>
need a remote control with a mute and an off switch. It&#39;s even cheaper<br/>
than a TV, its just fermented juice. Just dont buy a drink. Switching<br/>
off the TV is just as hard for me as not buying a drink is for<br/>
alcoholics.  I know its just as hard, I have been a drug addict.  and<br/>
I know I can beat this, but I also know that while I&#39;m working on it,<br/>
it&#39;s better for me not to have a TV in my home.<br/>
<br/>
I know it&#39;s not a common addiction, but there are those that are<br/>
sexaholics, those that are obsessive compulsive, those that are<br/>
addicted to sniffing glue, to cigarettes, all kinds of people with<br/>
serious addictions.  some physiological, all psychological.<br/>
<br/>
When I have had a TV in my home (and I have had one, and I know when I<br/>
stay at my in-laws&#39; or my parents&#39; where there&#39;s TV, its VERY hard for<br/>
me to stay away from it), I didnt take responsibility for myself. I<br/>
sat staring, I skipped meals, skipped sleep, I got angry and<br/>
frustrated if anything interrupted me, I made excuses to my friends<br/>
why I couldnt go and do things with them. I neglected myself and my life.<br/>
<br/>
For me, being able to have a computer, and to managing to stay with my<br/>
family where there is TV for weekends is a big improvement.  I&#39;m<br/>
working on it. Its a remarkable achievement, its a lot of work.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I JUST PLAN TO LIVE IT OUT HERE IN THIS BEAUTI-<br/>

&gt; US FROM BACK THEN ARE STILL AROUND AND GLAD<br/>
&gt; I AM BACK.  A.A. IN NASHVILLE IS WONDERFUL TOO<br/>
&gt; BUT IT WAS JUST TIME TO COME HOME IN SPITE OF<br/>
&gt; HAVING NO CENTRAL VISION AND THE BLOOD AND<br/>
&gt; BONE MARROW CANCER THAT SENT ME AWAT FROM<br/>
&gt; THIS THIN AIR AND TOO HIGH FOR ME ALTITUDE.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree, your friend&#39;s statement is beautiful.  She doesnt keep<br/>
alcohol in her home.  Congratulations to her. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; There&#39;s not all that much on the internet to download, I don&#39;t  <br/>
&gt; think.  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I have to correct you on that one.  You can download virtually<br/>
any TV show. You can watch a lot of live and &#39;podcast&#39; stuff. Check<br/>
out EMule for one of the more basic and widespread file sharing sites.<br/>
<br/>
She can&#39;t go visiting by herself, as she&#39;s three.  Do you  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; have an example of a place she&#39;s ever been where she could watch as  <br/>
&gt; much TV as she likes?  Do you ever leave her at anyone else&#39;s house?   <br/>
&gt; She&#39;s three.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She sure does go visiting by herself (well, I or someone has to drop<br/>
her off and pick her up). She has a couple of regular play-dates each<br/>
week where she goes to another child&#39;s home and stays there 5 hours or<br/>
so.  The family are also AP and GD and leaning toward Unschooling<br/>
(their kids aren&#39;t yet of school age).  They allow the kids to do as<br/>
they like.<br/>
 <br/>
She also spends a lot of time at her grandparents, where she is<br/>
allowed to watch as much TV as she likes.  She even has her own room<br/>
with a TV in it there. We go there most weekends, for Friday night<br/>
dinner and stay the weekend.  Sometimes I choose not to go, she goes<br/>
with her dad, sometimes she stays there without her father and I, at<br/>
her request.  A lot of the time at the end of the weekend when we<br/>
prepare to go home, she asks to stay, we let her. We come pick her up<br/>
when she asks to come home, usually after a day or 2.<br/>
<br/>
So far, she has never considered or questioned that we dont have a TV<br/>
at home.  If/ When she does, we will talk with her openly about it. <br/>
If she wants a TV, we will get her one.<br/>
  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How long would you wait to work on it if you felt unable to share  <br/>
&gt; books with her?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Since I&#39;m NOT waiting to work on it, but actively seeking help, and<br/>
improving, then this question seems a little irrelevant.<br/>

I think most of the post was irrelevant, not being about unschooling  <br/>
at all, but about defending particular statements that also weren&#39;t  <br/>
really about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
There are entire unschooling lists that are anti-TV, I&#39;ve been told.   <br/>

<br/>
The way you worded what you wrote did seem that way.  You seemed to  <br/>
be apologizing for not leaving yours at home.  I don&#39;t want to argue  <br/>
with you about it, I was trying to point out that your way of asking  <br/>
was odd and seemed to suggest that others here DID leave theirs home,  <br/>
but you weren&#39;t ready to do that.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know what GD is, but  I was hoping to help you see that it&#39;s  <br/>
not about toddlers that you&#39;d ask a passenger to wear a seatbelt.   <br/>

<br/>
Nursing a baby is what you would have done even if you were going to  <br/>
put your child in school.<br/>
The things you&#39;re describing that you have done with your child are  <br/>
things you would be doing even if you were going to put your child in  <br/>
school, aren&#39;t they?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
They can choose to give her freedom or they can choose not to.  The  <br/>
state can decide someone is giving a child too much freedom, and  <br/>
remove the child from the home.  Parents have duties and  <br/>
responsibilities and can&#39;t delegate those entirely to the children.   <br/>
They can share generously, but the child doesn&#39;t have equal  <br/>
responsibilities or freedom.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not about unschooling either.  It&#39;s about clarity.<br/>
<br/>

Yes.  I&#39;m sorry.  There was one negative too many.  What I meant was  <br/>
please don&#39;t post so much as you don&#39;t have much real experience and  <br/>
your posts are mostly argumentative and critical and defensive.  Your  <br/>

<br/>
This group probably doesn&#39;t interpret your words any special way.   <br/>
More likely people in most groups don&#39;t bother to really read and  <br/>
analyze things.  They just make friendly noise whether they read the  <br/>
posts or not.  Because this group exists to be analytical, that&#39;s how  <br/>
it goes here.  We&#39;ve never made anyone post; couldn&#39;t if we tried.   <br/>
There&#39;s no way to do it.<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re welcome to be on the list, but as it&#39;s intended for more  <br/>
experienced unschoolers I would appreciate it if you would hang back  <br/>

&gt; That is what these families I mentioned are doing. That is what I am<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I assume they&#39;re picturing their children living as adults in the  <br/>
third world societies they&#39;re growing up in, yes? Or do they feel  <br/>
it&#39;s equally likely that their kids will follow in their parents&#39;  <br/>
footsteps as be a corporate lawyer in Paris?<br/>
<br/>
Some parents  *do* choose in America to live away from technology.  <br/>
They feel the advantages out weigh the disadvantages. They feel the  <br/>
good things they gain outweigh the good things they give up.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s true of every choice we make. There are good parts and bad  <br/>
parts of every choice. Good and bad parts of the choice we make. Good  <br/>
and bad parts of the choices we reject. When we choose we choose  <br/>
(hopefully!) because the good stuff we gain outweighs the good stuff  <br/>
we lose.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is the same. We could gain a chunk of free time during  <br/>
the day if we sent our kids to school. We could have the comforting  <br/>
feeling (the illusion ;-) that they are being well prepared by  <br/>
experts. We wouldn&#39;t have to work so hard to find activities and  <br/>
friends and be involved in their lives. We could give them access to  <br/>
opportunities that many kids have fond memories of  that aren&#39;t  <br/>
easily recreated outside of school: school newspaper, yearbook,  <br/>
marching band, cheerleading, school sports (in some areas). (I could  <br/>
go on. Though it was hard coming up with those ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Most unschoolers will say &quot;Yeah, but ...&quot; to that list. In many cases  <br/>
unschoolers found something better. In some cases unschoolers decided  <br/>
it&#39;s not as important as something else they&#39;ve gained.<br/>
<br/>
*Every* choice we make we give good things up. Even heroin. If there  <br/>
weren&#39;t good parts of drugs and alcohol, no one would do them!<br/>
<br/>
I think if you were able to step back and look at your posts  <br/>
objectively, what you&#39;re trying to argue and get people to agree with  <br/>
is that unschooling without TV is just as good as unschooling with  <br/>
TV. And your supporting evidence is that TV is bad for you. That  <br/>
those in loving homes without technology grow up just fine. That she  <br/>
can have TV away from your home and TV-like things at home.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps, for right now, the best thing for your family is to not have  <br/>
TV while you work out your issues. The bad effect of having a TV  <br/>
could outweigh the good effect. That&#39;s personal to you and your  <br/>
family. Only you can really know (though others can point out where  <br/>
you aren&#39;t be objective.) But I think it will help you think about  <br/>
the issue clearly if you accept that you *are* giving something  <br/>
valuable up. It will help you to look at the situation objectively  <br/>
and see clearly what you&#39;re giving up to get something else (time to  <br/>
work out your problems with TV.)<br/>
<br/>
It *won&#39;t* help you to try to get others to agree with you. It  <br/>
*won&#39;t* help you to try to deny that what you&#39;re giving up isn&#39;t  <br/>
important.<br/>
<br/>
It will also help you see the situation clearly to see that you don&#39;t  <br/>
have years and years to work through your issues. At 3 my daughter  <br/>
wasn&#39;t much interested in broadcast TV. She watched some videos and  <br/>
movies. But by 6 she had favorite shows. In between 3 and 6 she did  <br/>
some exploring and experimenting to find those shows.<br/>

2.5 to 26! Part of the school-mindset that has pervaded our culture <br/>

can be hard to argue with, if someone has really bought into it. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also possible, under the circumstances, that the mom was <br/>
concerned that she was going to be &quot;babysitting&quot; a younger kid - <br/>
have the boys hung out together at her house before? How much time <br/>
have y&#39;all spent hanging out with them as a family? Would the boys <br/>
be willing to hang out at y&#39;all&#39;s house instead? Maybe the issue <br/>
isn&#39;t really age but something else and mom is just pulling out <br/>
a &quot;truism&quot; as a quick-and-dirty &quot;reason&quot;. Coming at the issue from a <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1178109113">Well, I must say, when I first started searching and researching on the<br/>
web about unschooling, finding Sandra&#39;s website and a seeminly endless<br/>
list of yahoo and google groups and tribes... I joined most all of the<br/>
groups I could find and lurked around till I found ones that I felt<br/>
were appropriate to me.<br/>
At first and even second glance, a lot of them look more-or-less very<br/>
similar, I am on Always Unschooled.  I did read the main page of<br/>
AlwaysLearning, and it just doesnt mention anything about being an<br/>
&quot;experienced&quot; unschoolers&#39; list.  it says:<br/>
<br/>
Discussion for homeschooling fans of John Holt, whose books Learning<br/>
All the Time, Never Too Late, and Teach your Own have made unschooling<br/>
a sweet and viable option for thousands of families. This is a<br/>
moderated group, with trapdoors for the uncooperative. (Not moderated<br/>
in the advance-approval way, but in the be-nice-to-play way.) It&#39;s an<br/>
idea group and is intended to lean more toward pure unschooling than<br/>
neutral, general homeschooling discussionthere are hundreds of general<br/>
homeschooling discussions for newcomers. It&#39;s to focus more toward how<br/>
people learn no matter where in the world they are, rather than on<br/>
what&#39;s legal in any particular country or jurisdiction. If you have<br/>
questions or complaints, write to...<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you like to edit it to mention something about being more for<br/>
experienced folk.  If I&#39;d known that, I probably would have held off on<br/>
posting.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, All this discussion did teach me a lot, and also got me<br/>
thinking about my TV problem (which is not an addiction in the sence<br/>
that I get withdrawls and cravings for it, but if there&#39;s a TV on in<br/>
the room I Physically (almost) cannot tear my eyes from it). So I went<br/>
to my doctor today, I&#39;m going to be tested for some form of epilepsy<br/>
that could be causing such a problem (I&#39;m also showing other typical<br/>
symptoms).<br/>
<br/>
So thanks for everything, I&#39;ll just go back to my lurking ;-)<br/>

I don&#39;t mind new unschoolers who want to read and think and talk  <br/>

Let us know, when you know more, which form of epilepsy sticks people  <br/>

It would be worth knowing that there could be something like that  <br/>

I can share stories, as a confirmed radical.  It&#39;s not bullshit.  Not  <br/>

How much would you pay for a simple answer?<br/>
Where would you go to get one?  Child psychologist?  Policeman?<br/>

people who did have experience, and potential reasons for the woman&#39;s  <br/>

<br/>
What we cannot do is state a rule that can be carried back to the  <br/>
other mom to make her change her mind.  There isn&#39;t a rule that says  <br/>
she has to let anyone else&#39;s kid visit.<br/>
<br/>
A request for a simple answer and complaints about complicated answer  <br/>
which are (if you&#39;re LUCKY, stories from confirmed radicals) seems to  <br/>

I just got back from a wedding.  There were social complications  <br/>
prior to this.  There were many friends of the ex boyfriend,  <br/>
relatives who liked him better than this guy, people wanting this to  <br/>
work, but still... there was more mystery and tension than most other  <br/>

<br/>
This list isn&#39;t for the handing out of wisdom.  It&#39;s not a drive  <br/>
through window.  It&#39;s a place for people who want to examine  <br/>
unschooling deeply and carefully can learn.  Some learn fast and some  <br/>
learn slowly, but   I didn&#39;t think many wanted to be taught, or  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-139407053">I shall let you know, when i know more.<br/>
Deb, sorry you feel that way.<br/>
There are many forms of epilepsy, many of them do not cause that kind<br/>
of &quot;seizure&quot;.<br/>
(I&#39;ve been on my google all morning)<br/>
Actually, I can and do, on occasion, stare without moving at my<br/>
computer screen saver for an hour or more.  Obviously, I was staring at<br/>
it for long enough for the screen saver to start up in the first place.<br/>
 Generally, because the computer is more &#39;interactive&#39; than a TV, which<br/>
is usually pretty passive, I can avoid this.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t stand electrical noise, like if the screen is left on after the<br/>
computer is turned off, the noise drives me crazy (most people can&#39;t<br/>
even hear it).  Flourescent lights make me feel ill in a nervous kind<br/>
of way. I often have the sensation of being very large or very small or<br/>
very far away from things, like my sense of spatial perception just had<br/>
a fit.  I have a LOT of deja vu and some sensory hallucinations, like<br/>
smells that arent there. I can just stop suddenly and stand,<br/>
motionless, thoughtless for half a minute or more without noticing.<br/>
<br/>
I do think that if parents notice unusual behaviours in their children,<br/>
like watching TV to the point of being in a &#39;trance&#39;, then they might<br/>
get some tests done, but I wouldnt want to scare parents with visions<br/>
of epileptic fits just because their kids watch a lot of TV.<br/>
My parents didnt notice this in me growing up because they werent there<br/>
most of the time, unschooling parents would definately notice something<br/>
like that in their child.<br/>

<br/>
Does your daughter?<br/>
<br/>
If this is a problem in you, maybe get a TV for her and some therapy  <br/>
for you.  But the therapy might be &quot;Stand up and walk if you know  <br/>
you&#39;re just sitting there staring.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-Obviously, I was staring at<br/>

<br/>
Staring without reading or moving your hands?  Staring and thinking  <br/>
about something else?  Asleep?  Screensavers don&#39;t usually take an  <br/>
hour to turn on.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Generally, because the computer is more &#39;interactive&#39; than a TV,  <br/>
which<br/>

<br/>
I haven&#39;t found TV to be so passive with my kids or with me.   <br/>
Especially if I&#39;m watching with someone else, we&#39;re interacting about  <br/>
what we&#39;re seeing.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I can&#39;t stand electrical noise, like if the screen is left on  <br/>

of way. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m that way about a lot of little sounds others don&#39;t hear.  There  <br/>
are places and things I avoid.  If someone&#39;s going to use nail  <br/>
clippers, I leave the building (or get at least two rooms away).  I  <br/>
cannot be in the room where someone else clips nails with nail  <br/>
clippers.  Clipping my own isn&#39;t as bad, but I only do it after a  <br/>
bath or shower, and I don&#39;t usually do toes AND fingers, just the  <br/>
worst places and then I stop.<br/>
<br/>
Because of that I could forbid nail clippers in my home, or refuse to  <br/>
buy them for people, or tell my family they could clip their nails at  <br/>
other people&#39;s houses but not mine.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I often have the sensation of being very large or very small or<br/>
very far away from things, like my sense of spatial perception just had<br/>
a fit.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I know those things--other objects look far away, and the room  <br/>
distorts in your mind.<br/>
<br/>
That can be from lack of protein.  Are you vegetarian, or do you not  <br/>
eat very often?  Try to see if that&#39;s happening when you&#39;re hungry.   <br/>
Also breathe more deeply more often.  Shallow breathing for too long  <br/>
at a time can make one &quot;light-headed&quot; and light headedness can bring  <br/>
those kinds of perceptual oddities.  If you breathe deeply a few  <br/>
times each half hour or so, and if you have a small protein snack (an  <br/>
egg, a handful of nuts, an ounce of cheese) every two hours or so, I  <br/>
bet that will decrease or go away completely.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I do think that if parents notice unusual behaviours in their  <br/>
children,<br/>
like watching TV to the point of being in a &#39;trance&#39;, then they might<br/>

<br/>
NO!  Absolutely not.  Because being intensely  involved in hearing a  <br/>
storyteller or listening to live music or reading a book can produce  <br/>
what appears to others to be like a trance, but being &quot;entranced&quot; by  <br/>
something isn&#39;t epilepsy.  It&#39;s an intense interest that some people  <br/>
never really experience.  And it&#39;s a wonderful thing.   And just  <br/>
because the people outside you can&#39;t see what you&#39;re thinking or hear  <br/>
what you&#39;re hearing or feel what you&#39;re feeling doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re  <br/>
&quot;doing nothing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-My parents didnt notice this in me growing up because they werent  <br/>

<br/>
 From the things you&#39;re writing, it seems you&#39;re having a hard time  <br/>
seeing your child directly, but you&#39;re seeing her through a filter of  <br/>
your experiences and fears and justifications.<br/>
<br/>
If you really can sit in front of a computer for an hour in a trance,  <br/>
where is she during that time?  Can you spend more time with her  <br/>
seeing what she really likes and wants and needs?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1468548227">***There are many forms of epilepsy, many of them do not cause that kind<br/>
of &quot;seizure&quot;.***<br/>
<br/>
My mom began having seizures during a recent illness and they seem to be<br/>
continuing.  She becomes perfectly still and makes a snoring/blowing<br/>
sound, pupils dilate and when it&#39;s over she pees herself.   I took care<br/>
of a woman for a couple of weeks whose seizures took the form of eerie<br/>
humming and hand motions.    <br/>
<br/>
I hope you don&#39;t have a seizure disorder because there&#39;s a risk to anti<br/>
seizure medications and they can cause birth defects and if you have<br/>
seizures they won&#39;t let you drive anymore and it could complicate you<br/>
being alone with your kid.    <br/>
<br/>
But lots of people stare, myself included.  I sometimes stare until the<br/>
screen saver comes on.  My screen saver is set to start after three<br/>
minutes but I can adjust it if I want to stare longer. &lt;g&gt;  Last time we<br/>
went camping I stared at the camp fire for an hour, just sitting and<br/>
staring and quiet.  I could have spent a lot of money and a week at a spa<br/>
for that kind of relaxation.   I knew a recovering alcoholic who stared;<br/>
it&#39;s apparently common during symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, too.   Some<br/>
people in deep thought stare.   Some people who consistently don&#39;t get<br/>
enough sleep stare.  Some people who are depressed stare. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s so common a thing in the brains of humans that we have slang<br/>
terminology for it.  Spacing out.  Zoning out.  <br/>
<br/>
If I was zoning out more often than I thought was normal I&#39;d check my<br/>
water intake and my fuel consumption.  Food helps almost everything. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
 My employer crashes about four in the afternoon and she resolves it with<br/>
a bottle of water and a handful of peanuts.  Without her &quot;fix&quot; she will<br/>
sit and stare.   Isn&#39;t that why the Brits embraced High Tea?  <br/>
<br/>
Some people can get comfortable with the way they are and understand<br/>
everyone has quirks and sensitivities and some people look for things to<br/>
be wrong.   Some people haven&#39;t examined their lives enough to understand<br/>
what residual emotional pain might be contributing to their seemingly<br/>
automatic behaviors.   Some people never think about consciously<br/>
addressing those things about themselves that could use attention.  Some<br/>
people think they&#39;re more interesting if their different or sick.    <br/>
<br/>
***I do think that if parents notice unusual behaviours in their<br/>
children,<br/>
like watching TV to the point of being in a &#39;trance&#39;, then they might<br/>
get some tests done,***<br/>
<br/>
People already do that and kids are medicated into conformity.   If they<br/>
don&#39;t read enough, if they don&#39;t sit still long enough, if they aren&#39;t<br/>
quiet when we want them to be, if they aren&#39;t busy when we want them to<br/>
be, if they seem angry, if they&#39;re too energetic, if they draw pictures<br/>
we don&#39;t like, if they want foods we don&#39;t want them to have...<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t get to be inside the heads of our kids.  They have a right to<br/>
think their own thoughts and feel their own feelings and we don&#39;t have<br/>
any right to know exactly what our kids are thinking and feeling at all<br/>
times. We might wish we had ownership of their brains and that we could<br/>
turn over little bits of it to them if they could prove they would use it<br/>
they way we want them to, but what&#39;s inside their head belongs to them. <br/>
If a kid is deeply engrossed in something on TV and the mom doesn&#39;t<br/>
understand why someone would watch it, let alone watch with deep interest<br/>
that doesn&#39;t mean the kid is in a trance.   The kids who are made to feel<br/>
like something is wrong with them become psychologically altered by the<br/>
intervention.   They hand over responsibility of themselves and their<br/>
actions to a diagnosis.  They feel and internalize a &quot;disorder&quot; that<br/>
isn&#39;t real.   <br/>
