themselves unschoolers. They use the Calvert Curriculum. <br/>
<br/>
They consider themselves unschoolers because: (1) they use their Calvert <br/>
Curriculum in a pretty relaxed way and have some fun doing it, (2) they only <br/>
do their lessons a few times a week, not everyday, and (3) they do lots of <br/>
other activities - their homeschooling is not LIMITED to using Calvert.<br/>
