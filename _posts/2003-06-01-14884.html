I had a strong will and quick temper my entire life...something I am still <br/>
learning about.<br/>
I hit a girl in High school because she was taunting me and wouldn&#39;t <br/>
stop....some people just need longer to aquire skills for walking away or diffusing <br/>
bad situations.<br/>
Sounds like it all ended up ok, and HEY, she&#39;s only 8.<br/>
I didn&#39;t have the skills for solving problems peaceably until late in my teen <br/>
years and still have to think really hard to not lose my temper.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s young, she has a strong personality and she learned something from <br/>
this.<br/>
Let it go, that&#39;s what I think.<br/>
