<div id="ygrps-yiv-1471507664">I know this is regional, and I&#39;m sorry about that, but I promised I&#39;d  <br/>
mention it:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to remind people about this conference, at which Pam and I  <br/>
will be speaking.  We used to think all our kids would be there, but  <br/>
it will be three or four of them.<br/>
<br/>
It will be a one-day conference, Saturday Marcy 7, in Tempe, Arizona.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a bio of Kirby here (and Pam and me, but we&#39;ve had bios online  <br/>
before):<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hena.us/conferenceSpeaker.html#Kirby_Dodd">http://www.hena.us/conferenceSpeaker.html#Kirby_Dodd</a><br/>
<br/>
And from that page you can get to other conference information.<br/>
<br/>
It would be possible to see an all-unschooling program from the time-- <br/>
me, then Pam, then Kirby; lunch<br/>
Grace Llewellyn, teen/young-adult panel, then me, Pam and all the kids  <br/>
we have there.   Then there&#39;s a talent show and it&#39;s over.<br/>
<br/>
Because our kids will have presentation time, we aren&#39;t going to do  <br/>
anything on Sunday as was once considered, so never mind Sunday.<br/>
<br/>
Saturday, though, all day!<br/>
<br/>
