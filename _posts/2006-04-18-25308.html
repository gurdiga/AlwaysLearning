<div id="ygrps-yiv-1164118019">My dh has taken a step towards figuring out this whole step-dad thing (been<br/>
together 3 years) and trying to understand unschooling (we just started this<br/>
year) checked out some books at the library.  I cant remember all the titles<br/>
but I know two are about step parenting/being a step father and one is the<br/>
Unschooling Handbook.  So far he hasn&#39;t read a single word but at least he<br/>
has taken the step of checking them out!  Yay DAD!<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, seeing the step-parenting books made me wonder what parenting<br/>
approach they are. One says positive discipline...&quot;Positive Discipline for<br/>
Blended Families&quot; by Jane Nelsen, Cheryl Erwin and Stephen Glenn.  The<br/>
other, addressed to teens, is called &quot;Stepliving for Teens&quot; by Joel D. Block<br/>
and Susan S. Bartell.  I have very little time to read and am in process of<br/>
trying to read my own unschooling literature so I am writing to see what I<br/>
can find out from you all.  Does anyone know anything about these books or<br/>
the authors?  Can anyone recommend any books that would be<br/>
unschooly/suitable for a step-father of an 11 year old boy (whole family new<br/>
to unschooling)?<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks in advance for your help!<br/>
 <br/>
In Gratitude,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2118354774">It&#39;s not about being a step-parent, but it&#39;s my favorite parenting <br/>
book.  Living Joyfully with Children by Win and Bill Sweet.  Easy <br/>
readm but packed full of wisdom  Written by grandparents, not PhD&#39;s. <br/>
(Well, they may be PhD&#39;s in something, but they&#39;re not using it as <br/>
expertise for the book.)  <br/>
<br/>
That book replaced my former favorite, which was &quot;How to talk so <br/>
kids will listen...&quot;  which is still available.<br/>
<br/>
The important thing for a step-dad to remember is that everything he <br/>
does might be taken wrong, until he really, really gains the child&#39;s <br/>
trust, and he&#39;s proven that he&#39;s reasonable and approachable.  This <br/>
takes years, in most cases  He should never discipline your son, or <br/>
complain in front of your son that you don&#39;t discipline him.  When <br/>
my husband and I were first married, he tried to make my middle son <br/>
sit and eat his whole dinner.  Since Jon didn&#39;t seem too distressed, <br/>
I let it go (I wasn&#39;t an unschooler then, either). As soon as my dh <br/>
saw fit to let him up from the table, Jon threw up in the trash <br/>
can.  My husband to this day learns from that example, even though <br/>
that was over 16 years ago and Jon is 21.  <br/>
<br/>
Your husband might also consider you might be right when you say <br/>
it&#39;s different when it&#39;s your own.  It would be nice if step-dads <br/>
and moms could actually feel for their stepchildren the way they do <br/>
about their own children.  But if they don&#39;t have any biological <br/>
children, they probably can&#39;t recognize the depth of feeling.  It&#39;s <br/>
not something you can explain.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, get those books.  They&#39;ll be quite helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Karen, in for a peek<br/>
