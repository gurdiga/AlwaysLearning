<div id="ygrps-yiv-611529710">A little more information.  They are  fairly religious family and they<br/>
homeschooled mainly to keep their kids away from other kids they thought<br/>
would be a bad influence.  In the beginning they tried to find places for<br/>
their kids to get together with others but as time went on, their family<br/>
grew (7 kids) and they ended up living in a rural location.  It just got<br/>
harder an harder for the mom to get all the kids to all the places they<br/>
wanted to go and manage with the little babies too.  <br/>
<br/>
The oldest girl is just now old enough to drive, but I don&#39;t know if they<br/>
have just the one vehicle that the dad uses for work or two or what.<br/>
(should have asked) <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve know the mom since we were nine.(30 years!)  She&#39;s worried now about<br/>
how they&#39;ve homeschooled and her older kids are feeling stifled.  Her<br/>
husband is fairly demanding/controlling and they&#39;ve been through some<br/>
financial difficulties lately. <br/>
All in all a stressful family situation.  <br/>
<br/>
I was hoping to find some good clear ideas for her to calm her oldest<br/>
down and herself and from there maybe she can gain perspective on what to<br/>
do with the rest of the time she has with her kids.  <br/>
<br/>
I really appreciate all the thoughts on this subject.  I just have one<br/>
child, and he&#39;s not at all thinking in terms of college right now at ten.<br/>
 (whew!)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Heidi and everyone, <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Though I wasn&#39;t homeschooled, my father was very demanding and controlling<br/>
when I was growing up. I&#39;m also an introverted person, but I don&#39;t know if<br/>
it was a result of my upbringing. I do know that I couldn&#39;t wait to move out<br/>
of my parents house and did as soon as I was financially able to do so. I<br/>
felt really frustrated while I was living at home and couldn&#39;t wait to move<br/>
out and have more control of my life.<br/>

only idea that comes to my mind is to recommend lightening up on the kids<br/>
and letting them have some control of their lives while they still live at<br/>
home. It&#39;s hard growing up with controlling parents.<br/>
