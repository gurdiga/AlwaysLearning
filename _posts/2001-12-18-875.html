<div id="ygrps-yiv-718081256">Hi everyone, <br/>
<br/>
Sorscha, myself, and my two homeschool neighbors will be starting a <br/>
Space-unit in January.   Are children are ages 2,4,4,4,6,6, so <br/>
obviously we need a lot of hands-on activities.  Building, creating, <br/>
exploding, etc. Any ideas for us newbies!<br/>
<br/>
Thanking you in advance!<br/>

Homeschool Association of California.  ZILLIONS of cool websites are listed<br/>
there, covering any subject you could imagine.  I&#39;m sure the NASA site is<br/>
among them, but in case it&#39;s not, try<br/>

<br/>
Dorling Kindersley books have series for younger kids; I think we have one<br/>
on space which included activities for exploring gravity, etc.  Also, the<br/>
Magic Schoolbus book on space is *great.*  We all learned a lot from it!<br/>

Once you sign your kids up, they send you a postcard to confirm registration <br/>
(we got ours in 2 days).<br/>
<br/>
Space weather also has a kids site.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1945452747">&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://celestia.sourceforge.net/&quot;">http://celestia.sourceforge.net/&quot;</a>&gt;Celestia: A 3D Space Simulator&lt;/A&gt; Here is a good download program that is free. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
From their site....<br/>
Celestia is a real-time visual simulation of space in our local region of the <br/>
universe. Choose a point within about 1000 light years of Earth, and Celestia <br/>
will show you an approximation of how it would appear to your eyes were you <br/>
actually there. Some of what Celestia shows is necessarily hypothetical--the <br/>
farther away from Earth you get, the less real data there is and the more <br/>
guesswork is involved. Thus Celestia supplements observational data with good <br/>
guesses based on models of stellar and planetary processes. ....<br/>

<br/>
Felicitas/Nancy&#39;s ideas were great, but I have a different kind of idea.<br/>
<br/>
Read more John Holt, and try to get away from &quot;doing units.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Space was there last month and it will be there in March.  Why connect space <br/>
with January?   Or have a space party and blow stuff up, but let the kids do <br/>
or not do, and learn or not learn.  &quot;Doing a unit&quot; has a stiffness and <br/>
expectation and limitation to it that  not only isn&#39;t part of a  natural real <br/>
life, but that will ultimately serve to separate learning from &quot;non-learning.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And if I sound crazy but unit studies sounds really good to you, there are <br/>
sites and lists who will agree with you, and be all about unit studies.<br/>
