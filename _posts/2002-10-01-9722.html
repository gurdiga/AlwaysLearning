&lt;&lt; We had a Nojo Sling when mine were little that worked<br/>
 well for us.  It was denim with a stuffed flannel edge<br/>
 (softer for baby&#39;s sticky-out parts like legs and<br/>
 head) so I liked the look of it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was repetative! Sorry. <br/>
I forgot to mention that stuffed edge and the easy adjustments..... <br/>
The NoJo was my favorite by far out of all the slings I saw or tried!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1124880224">I absolutely adore the OTSBH sling. So much so that I used to sell <br/>
them. I also made my own nursing wear as part of the business. I <br/>
first got a NOJO sling when my 2nd was born but it was too big and I <br/>
didn&#39;t do it up properly and I didn&#39;t know how to use it either.<br/>
I gave it away. <br/>
I next saw a LLLleader with an OTSBH at a meeting w/ #3. I was so <br/>
impressed!<br/>
I&#39;ve been a faithful sling user ever since. I have one in the car and <br/>
(actually) 2 in the house! dh won&#39;t let me have more than 3 ;) so <br/>
when I wanted another fabric as a distributor, I had to sell one of <br/>
the other ones so I could buy a new one.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t use it as much around the house now as I did w/ #3 and 4 but <br/>
I still have to know where my sling is at all times. I LOVE the sling!<br/>
I don&#39;t sell anymore but not because I don&#39;t love it!<br/>
