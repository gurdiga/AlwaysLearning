<div id="ygrps-yiv-443795466">I hope this isn&#39;t too off topic.  I&#39;m reading Frank McCourt&#39;s Teacher Man.  Besides being funny, I keep finding references to *real learning* (my term, not the author&#39;s).  Also, there was a thing about sheep in the first chapter &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
It reminded me of Sandra&#39;s stories of working as a teacher and singing ballads to the kids.<br/>

My son and I heard him interviewed on NPR (while we were making our long drive home from park day).  James thought the creative writing class where McCourt had the class write their best excuse notes was wonderful, and wanted to make sure we told our resident &quot;teacher man&quot; (his dad) about it when we got home.<br/>

PS  My kid really seems to like memoirs to be read to him.  Anyone want to suggest a favorite?  We started this memoir-kick with Swimming to Antarctica.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1344229909">Tania Aebi&#39;s Maiden Voyage was a great read.  Dh LUV&#39;d it.  I was a<br/>
bit sad about the dad&#39;s decisions but the experience Tania had was<br/>
definitely worth reading about.  The way she writes was fun too.<br/>
