<div id="ygrps-yiv-1003509116">Interesting that the school believes money is the &quot;thing&quot; we ought to be<br/>
focusing on that makes us &quot;wealthy&quot;.  What about the love we have to<br/>
give to others, ourselves and doing something we love for a living that<br/>
we are passionate about, regardless of the money it brings us.  It also<br/>
leaves out those people that didn&#39;t finish high school and still became<br/>
financially wealthy such as Dave Thomas the founder of Wendys.<br/>
<br/>
So as usual the school is single minded in its belief that money is the<br/>
answer to everything and that money will make everything better.  Ask<br/>
those people who become instant millionaires when they won the lottery<br/>
what it did for them emotionally.  <br/>
<br/>
There is also a vast difference between someone who &quot;drops out&quot; of<br/>
school and someone who voluntarily doesn&#39;t go to school at all because<br/>
they choose to use the world as their way of learning.  Even the drop<br/>
outs have the right idea when they don&#39;t want to stay in school because<br/>
there are bored, uninspired and cannot connect with what adults<br/>
disguised as &quot;teachers&quot; believe they need to know.<br/>
<br/>
I spent my entire 5th year (that&#39;s the last year in British Schools if<br/>
you are not going onto University) skipping school nearly every day.<br/>
There were about 5 of us that would go to my house and read entire<br/>
books.  We would take it in turns to read out loud and read books such<br/>
as Little Women or a good Harold Robbins book.  We spent the spring<br/>
cleaning up our back garden where the grass had grown to about 3 feet<br/>
and it was a mess.  We planted flowers and made it look beautiful.  I<br/>
remember it as being the best experience I&#39;d had in my life up to that<br/>
point.<br/>

&gt;&gt;Today I was at a Destination Imagination event being held at a high <br/>
&gt;&gt;school.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;There was a sign in one of the rooms that said that people who<br/>

from high school make about $236,000 more in income in their lifetime <br/>
than those who drop out.&gt;&gt;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1123644439">A phrase from a song that I like comes to mind when this is discussed, <br/>
 <br/>
 &quot;I am rich, I have no money.&quot;    The singer has so many other things in her life.  :-D<br/>
 <br/>
Its a wonderful song.<br/>
