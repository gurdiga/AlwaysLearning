<div id="ygrps-yiv-549569026">On facebook one of my kids misspelled something, and I sent a message  <br/>
on the side, with a quote from etymonline.com<br/>
<br/>
=============================<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Subject:   &quot;Mellow Drama&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is wrong, but in a really awesome way:  &quot; I&#39;m not mellow dramatic  <br/>
about it anymore.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
God, I LOVE That. But it&#39;s melodrama.  Melodramatic.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;melo&quot; is about it being a musical or having music.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
melodrama<br/>
1802, melodrame, &quot;a stage-play in which songs were interspersed and  <br/>
music accompanied the action,&quot; from Fr. mélodrame, from Gk. melos  <br/>
&quot;song&quot; (see melody) + Fr. drame &quot;drama&quot; (see drama). Meaning &quot;a  <br/>
romantic and sensational dramatic piece with a happy ending&quot; is from  <br/>
1883, since this was often the form of the original melodramas.<br/>
<br/>
==============================<br/>
<br/>
Some thought went into that.<br/>
<br/>
Hema quoted her young daughter, Zoya, on her blog:<br/>
<br/>
  Zoya&#39;s language usage is as usual unique.  She told me the road is  <br/>
grumpy.  I asked her why.  She said &quot;can&#39;t you feel it?&quot;  The road we  <br/>
were driving on was very bumpy ;-)<br/>
<br/>
When Marty was little he thought we were saying &quot;Fairy dogs&quot; when we  <br/>
talked about &quot;prairie dogs.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the errors are better than the proper understandings.<br/>

I mean some thought went into the decision of how to spell (without  <br/>
knowing what it looked like) melodrama--not into my response.  In  <br/>
thought went into &quot;grumpy road&quot; and &quot;fairy dog.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
My 10 year old, Makayla, came up with some great words when she was younger.<br/>
Often she made a lot of sense.<br/>
yesterday - &quot;last-er-day&quot;<br/>
umbrella - &quot;under-brella&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then when she was a bit older and learning to ride a bike, she kind of fell<br/>
a bit (to a standing position over her tilted bike. She loudly said<br/>
&quot;DAMAGE!&quot; It was all I could do not to laugh as I innocently asked her if<br/>
something got damaged. She pondered my response and then asked what &quot;damage&quot;<br/>
means. That is the closest she has ever come to swearing!<br/>

Horatio uses it in Hamlet.  He tells Hamlet he thinks he saw his  <br/>
father yesternight.<br/>
<br/>
In older writings you&#39;ll see yestereve (last night) and yesternoon and  <br/>
yestermorn too.  So he&#39;s using English perfectly well, if a little  <br/>
archaically.<br/>

Nena has a whole repertoire of wonderful errors, of which only three are coming to mind right now:<br/>
<br/>
We have neighbors named the Fitzgibbons, and she calls them the Thanksgivings.  I&#39;ve started calling them the Thanksgivings!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s become a joke for her now, and she has a sly little smile when she says it, but she likes to ask me to fill up her compass with soup. (Thermos)<br/>
<br/>
She calls the pits inside apricots, peaches, and cherries &quot;snapes&quot; which always makes me envision a miniature Severus Snape hiding inside the fruit.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-66738260">&quot;Mellow Drama&quot;! Such a wonderful concept, especially as it evokes something so entirely different in my head than the word &#39;melodrama&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Holly once tweeted: <br/>
&quot;Marty and I doddled to Fastino&#39;s for lunch! Disc 1 of Roots showed up today. I have a stack to wrap. And my mom and I are going to a party.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
To which I replied:<br/>
&quot;Doddled? Is that a verb for when two Dodds go someplace together? Aaw!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Holly answered:<br/>
&quot;no really, it&#39;s a word! Though in this case it was two Dodds walking across a vacant lot, in no speedy fashion.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I assume &#39;doddled&#39; was Holly&#39;s interpretation of the word &#39;dawdled&#39;, but I truly loved the idea that there could be a word specifically used for journeys undertaken by some combination of Dodds. (I did, however, feel bad in case I&#39;d inadvertently made Holly feel bad!)<br/>

I have a friend named Steve Wander.<br/>
In the SCA he (not very imaginatively) made his name &quot;Stefan of the  <br/>
Wanderers.&quot;  I roll my eyes BIG when someone just barely dinks with  <br/>
their real name when they can have any cool medieval name ever.  Like   <br/>
Robert Spencer was &quot;Robert de Spencer.&quot;  GET A LIFE!  (I mean get  <br/>
anOTHER life.)    But anyway... For a while he was the baron of the  <br/>
local group, and if anyone said they were going to &quot;wander around&quot; or  <br/>
anything, he would stop them and say they could saunter, or ramble,  <br/>
but only he could wander. :-)<br/>

&gt; &gt; On facebook one of my kids misspelled something, and I sent a message<br/>
&gt; &gt; on the side, with a quote from etymonline.com<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; =============================<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Subject: &quot;Mellow Drama&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; This is wrong, but in a really awesome way: &quot; I&#39;m not mellow dramatic<br/>
&gt; &gt; about it anymore.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; God, I LOVE That. But it&#39;s melodrama. Melodramatic.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The &quot;melo&quot; is about it being a musical or having music.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; melodrama<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1802, melodrame, &quot;a stage-play in which songs were interspersed and<br/>
&gt; &gt; music accompanied the action,&quot; from Fr. m�lodrame, from Gk. melos<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;song&quot; (see melody) + Fr. drame &quot;drama&quot; (see drama). Meaning &quot;a<br/>
&gt; &gt; romantic and sensational dramatic piece with a happy ending&quot; is from<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1883, since this was often the form of the original melodramas.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; ==============================<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Some thought went into that.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hema quoted her young daughter, Zoya, on her blog:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Zoya&#39;s language usage is as usual unique. She told me the road is<br/>
&gt; &gt; grumpy. I asked her why. She said &quot;can&#39;t you feel it?&quot; The road we<br/>
&gt; &gt; were driving on was very bumpy ;-)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; When Marty was little he thought we were saying &quot;Fairy dogs&quot; when we<br/>
&gt; &gt; talked about &quot;prairie dogs.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sometimes the errors are better than the proper understandings.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1498308420">One of our favorites from when Colin was little was that he used the word &quot;stretchy&quot; to describe anything that seemed tall or long to him.  People and giraffes, I remember, but also things like pencils or pieces of rope or tall buildings.<br/>
<br/>
And because of an old family story about my aunt, we all sometimes jokingly mispronounce the word &quot;misled&quot; - for the longest time, she thought it had a long i, followed by a z sound - MYzled.  She had only seen it in print.<br/>
<br/>
This is a fun thread.  It&#39;s like a little window on how our minds get creative when we&#39;re trying to make sense of things.<br/>

<br/>
When it&#39;s finished, have you worked it?<br/>
It&#39;s not just jigsaws for which we say &quot;I worked it.&quot;  Other physical  <br/>
puzzles, too.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s still being worked you could be working on it, but if you just  <br/>
work on it and then put it away unfinished... you didn&#39;t &quot;work it.&quot; :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1411221504">I remember when Evan was quite young, still in his big car seat, (maybe 20 months?) we were hanging out in the car after being in the grocery store, having a little snack before we went home. I saw him wiggle his foot, and look and look at it. Finally, he asked, &quot;Is that MY foot, or YOUR foot?&quot; I saw immediately he was asking about the pronouns, not the ownership. I explained that it was his foot, that when he talked about it, he&#39;d say &#39;my foot&#39;; when I talked about it, I would say &#39;your foot&#39;. Then I did the same with my own foot. I could *see* it click in his mind.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always loved that sweet memory. Grateful for our connection, so I didn&#39;t say, &quot;What do you mean?! Of course it&#39;s YOUR foot!&quot;<br/>

I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s my Indian English or whether New Englanders work on a puzzle, or whether I&#39;ve simply not paid enough attention to the phrase used by people around me.
