<div id="ygrps-yiv-1031009114">You are free to register NOW!<br/>
<br/>
The website is still in progress (but much busier), but the <br/>
registration is complete---t-shirt info and everything!<br/>
<br/>
You may e-mail, snail mail or fax (if using the fax, you will need to <br/>
call first to allow me to turn the fax on) registrations to me . <br/>
Payment can be made via check or PayPal.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking forward to seeing who is coming this year!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1253336531">And please note, if you go and look at the presenters, that I am in the  <br/>
center square, as though I were Whoopi Goldberg, who has a tie-in with last  <br/>
month&#39;s conference other than that, and so I connect the dots.<br/>
