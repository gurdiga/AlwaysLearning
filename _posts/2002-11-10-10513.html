I am just heartsick.<br/>
Reading about Christie Watts was almost too much, her poor family. That is <br/>
awful.<br/>
<br/>
And then all the stuff about that Christian website. I&#39;m not even going <br/>
there. I know it will just make me feel horrible and there is nothing I can <br/>
do to stop it, other than loving the heck out of my kids and making sure they <br/>
don&#39;t ever do stupid, mean things to their children, at least that&#39;s the hope.<br/>
I just don&#39;t understand people that want to promote misery in this world. <br/>
Especially when you read about people like Christie and realize there is <br/>
enough misery and sadness without anyone trying to contribute! ugh.<br/>
