<div id="ygrps-yiv-1908522783">I got emails from my mother and my husband this morning that made me think<br/>
about this list--about people always learning. :) My mother wrote that she&#39;s<br/>
studying for a test she&#39;s taking for her job--a test to become a &quot;certified<br/>
anti-money-laundering specialist.&quot; She made a joke about how it&#39;s just what<br/>
she always dreamed of being when she was a little girl. It isn&#39;t, but she<br/>
really enjoys her job, which has to do with banking and computers.<br/>
<br/>
My husband is a comic-book editor. He sent me a jpg of a page of comic book<br/>
art that came across his desk today. It&#39;s part of a monthly issue of one of<br/>
his series. Scott (his last name is Peterson, which comes into the story)<br/>
got the pages from the letterer, which means they had already been<br/>
pencilled, inked, and colored. Scott forwarded the colored pages on to the<br/>
penciller and letterer for review before he had a chance to review them<br/>
himself. (As editor, a big part of his job is going over everything at each<br/>
stage of the process, from script to printed book.) A little while later the<br/>
penciller called him, laughing, wondering if he&#39;d seen page 8 yet. Scott<br/>
hadn&#39;t. He cracked up when he did look--in one panel there&#39;s an old-timey<br/>
movie poster stuck to a telephone pole, and the letterer had added, as a<br/>
joke, a word balloon with the words &quot;Scott Peterson is dreamy&quot; coming out of<br/>
the starlet&#39;s mouth. There&#39;s a bunch of other dialogue on the page, so you<br/>
don&#39;t notice at first glance; you have to actually read the balloons and<br/>
then it&#39;s really funny.<br/>
<br/>
Scott showed the whole thing to me, and we were laughing about it. He said<br/>
the really funny part is that when he was ballooning the issue (marking<br/>
where the word balloons should go before the letterer does the lettering),<br/>
HE had stuck a joke balloon in that spot so the starlet was saying &quot;I love<br/>
[letterer&#39;s name].&quot; (I forget the guy&#39;s name.)  Scott wrote me, &quot;Never start<br/>
a lettering war with a letterer&quot; and it made me laugh, because that is<br/>
definitely something they don&#39;t teach you in school!<br/>
<br/>
Both their stories, my mom&#39;s and Scott&#39;s, struck me as examples of how real<br/>
life can take us places that have nothing to do with what we did in school,<br/>
and how there is always something new to know.<br/>

<br/>
Years ago I was at a little medieval feast, on the ground, in the  <br/>
Jemez mountains near Los Alamos.   We were in a beautiful meadow,  <br/>
sitting on the ground along a long table laid out low, with &quot;dragon&#39;s  <br/>
tail (ham in a big pastry with scales) and other artsy food.  There  <br/>
were probably 45 of us.<br/>
<br/>
One of the things on the table was miniature cheese rounds in red wax,  <br/>
and yellow wax.   So one of the ladies at our end of the table made a  <br/>
rose with her wax, and we passed it down to the queen who was sitting  <br/>
mid-table, with a message that we challenged the other end of the  <br/>
table to a contest.   When the message  reached the other end of the  <br/>
table, they whooped and scrambled.<br/>
<br/>
I leaned over and looked down there and WHAT A MISTAKE we had made.    <br/>
They had three professional artists--and SCULPTORS, carvers,  <br/>
jewelers.  And they had four or so great amateurs.   I looked around  <br/>
our end.  Musicans, singers, writers.   So we quickly made a  <br/>
concession song and sang it with a harmony after they passed around  <br/>
their entries, which included a mermaid, a dragon and a sea serpent in  <br/>
two colors with a giant red wax penis (well, giant for the size of the  <br/>
sea serpent)--they were doing two-color things with minute details.<br/>
<br/>
So we sang something that ended &quot;...Puffed and wheezed and cut their  <br/>
cheese, and so we let them win.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s when I learned the equivalent of &quot;never start a lettering war  <br/>
with a letterer.&quot;<br/>
