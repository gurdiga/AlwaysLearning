Wow, thank you so much for sharing that. I didn&#39;t realize it  was written by <br/>
the mom of a child of Spina Bifida when I sent it to my mother  years ago, <br/>
hoping she&#39;d find a lightness of heart in it. Sadly, my mother has  taken the <br/>
opposite viewpoint all her life and my sending her the poem wasn&#39;t  uplifting, <br/>
just a depressing reminder to her. I don&#39;t think she&#39;s realized that  taking the <br/>
negative viewpoint has not only affected her life, but also my  fathers, my <br/>
own and most profoundly, my brother&#39;s. He had the potential to be a  full-on <br/>
member of society, but after decades of the negativity and the obvious  (though <br/>
never spoken to him, that I know of) wish that things were different, he  is <br/>
now emotionally and socially handicapped.  And even he knows it, now.  <br/>
Heartbreaking.<br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>
De<br/>
