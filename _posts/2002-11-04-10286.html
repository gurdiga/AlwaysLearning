and elegant.<br/>
<br/>
Shyrley who really should be doing something else<br/>
<br/>

&quot;You laugh at me because I&#39;m different. I laugh at you because you are all the same.&quot;</div>

 </span></blockquote>(sigh)  what is it about him?  That cool collectedness<br/>
that we know is just barely covering a passionate side<br/>
(see his enraged &quot;Ahab&quot; Jean-Luc in First Contact) or<br/>
the gentleman with the commanding presence (Make it<br/>
so!) or the accent?  I saw him do a bit on Seasame<br/>
Street once, LOL, where he is wearing an Elizabethan<br/>
collar and harkening back to his Shakespearean theater<br/>
days by holding a letter B and spout &quot;To B or not to<br/>
B...&quot; etc.  He&#39;s in good company.  I did a Sesame<br/>
Street bit once too, when I worked at the zoo as a<br/>
teen and I was talking about snakes and showing some<br/>
to some kids.  My sister saw it and called to tease me<br/>
about it, but I wanted to know why she was watching<br/>
Seasame Street before they had any kids... :)<br/>

I recall correctly, it&#39;s been a while.  <br/>
<br/>
Hey what&#39;s all this guilt about enjoying actors?  I<br/>
thought this is what Hollywood was all about, the<br/>
Modern Western Mythology.  Besides, guilt tastes bad.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;I still think Jean-Luc Picard is the hottest thing in<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s the way his eyes sparkle and crinkle and that little smirk he <br/>
gets for a smile and the way he sometimes cocks his head to one side just a <br/>
bit - and of course, the way he *never* denigrates anybody and always pulls <br/>
everyone out of the jam without loosing his cool - while looking good in <br/>
those form fitting fleet uniforms....<br/>
Ah, yes, where was I?<br/>
<br/>
It might help matters that I thought Yul Brenner was pretty hot and of <br/>
course, I married a man who&#39;s going bald faster than not.</div>

I have a HUGE thing for Irish men.<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone remember Michael Collins????????????<br/>
<br/>
Liam Neeson<br/>
Aidan Quinn<br/>
Alan Rickman<br/>
<br/>
and I cannot remember if G Byrne was in it as well.<br/>
<br/>
Liza<br/>
A good ol&#39;  puertorrique√±a, who married a good ol&#39; Irish boy from <br/>
Jersey and has two little black Irish heartthrobs called Evan Michael <br/>
and Aidan Gabriel<br/>
