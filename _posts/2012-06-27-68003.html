<div id="ygrps-yiv-1262600640">Sorry, there was a delay in some e-mails.  I&#39;m in Holland, but wrote some e-mail last night and early this morning, and it sat unsent until I could get online again.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t read a long day&#39;s worth of mail so if my stuff seems disjoint, I didn&#39;t mean for it to be.  The internet was down when I woke up, and then there were airports and stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m putting pictures of some of my adventures on my personal blog, and there are links to some of the full sets (and there will be more), too, at the second link.<br/>
