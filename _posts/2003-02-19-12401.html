You must know everything.<br/>
Damn.  I&#39;m not telling any more personal stories.<br/>
You&#39;ll see through me and know all my tricks.  <br/>

I *HATE* it when people say &quot;Hey, you&#39;re the English teacher&quot; to me, 20 years <br/>
after I quit teaching English.  Almost 24 years.  But being a teacher is like <br/>
being a priest or a nun.  You never undo it.<br/>

Funny enough people do get edgy when I reveal what I used too do. They think my<br/>
blank and neutral expression means I&#39;m analysing them. Usually it means my brain<br/>
is switched off and I&#39;m just about too say &#39;huh?&#39;<br/>

totally suck at, and they appreciated my sucklessness.  I have to go back to<br/>
elementary school for the One I Hate, the One Who Made Me a Homeschooler --<br/>

My math teachers tried, poor dears, but I was hopeless.  Mrs. Gaunt laid<br/>
that groundwork.<br/>
