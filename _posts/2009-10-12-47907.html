Was he in school a while?<br/>
Has he learned what he&#39;s doing in his own way, or did you teach him  <br/>
phonics?<br/>

I have lots of ideas, but wanted some more details on this particular  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-599008648">I don&#39;t know if these videos will be too elementary for your son - but I swear by them: Leap Frog videos - 1st one is &quot;Letter Factory&quot; and the second one is:  &quot;Word Factory&quot; - can be purchased at Target or online.<br/>
It teaches kids the sound of each letter in 1st video and then how to put the sounds together in the second one - and they are very entertaining and fun. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-874576000">he has been homeschooled since the beginning of his life and because we follow<br/>
an unschooling approach we have just let him be - i have read to him and use<br/>
my finger to follow along under the words -  i tried to do phonics with him<br/>
but it seemed too frustrating for him and then i would just leave it for a<br/>
while - it seems that he started learning by memorizing the words that he<br/>
would see but it took him a long time to memorize the ones he knows now and he<br/>
tells me that when he sees a word like &#39;saw&#39; for instance i will tell him what<br/>
it is and then when he sees it again he forgets  - he gets really frustrated<br/>
and says &#39; why can&#39;t i remember the words?!  what&#39;s wrong with me!  now that<br/>
he is learning the sounds of the letters (this year) he is trying to sound out<br/>
words phonetically but as i said before he will sound them out letter by<br/>
letter (poster is p o s t e r)  so it totally distorts the whole word.<br/>
<br/>
i have been reading about dyslexia - and it sounds exactly like that - so of<br/>
course now i am feeling guilty about not getting him help earlier!  and am<br/>
questioning the whole unschooling thing!  but basically i just need to know at<br/>
this point how i should continue with him - i don&#39;t want to deny a disability<br/>
by saying - he&#39;ll learn in his own sweet time&#39; and i don&#39;t want to focus on it<br/>
either?!<br/>

<br/>
But you would pick it up for a while.  Even using your finger under  <br/>
the words is a way to &quot;teach reading.&quot;  You don&#39;t do that when you  <br/>
read to adults who can read, I bet.<br/>
<br/>
-=-he gets really frustrated<br/>

<br/>
Because he can&#39;t read yet, that&#39;s all!  There&#39;s nothing wrong with  <br/>
him, but ever step toward teaching can be a step away from learning.<br/>
<br/>
-=he is trying to sound out<br/>
words phonetically but as i said before he will sound them out letter by<br/>
letter (poster is p o s t e r) so it totally distorts the whole word.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Right.  Which isn&#39;t really reading.  I could read any language in  <br/>
Europe if that were reading.  I would be trying to sound them out, but  <br/>
there would be no comprehension (and not much pronunciation that  <br/>
sounded like words either).<br/>
<br/>
-=-i have been reading about dyslexia - and it sounds exactly like  <br/>
that - so of<br/>
course now i am feeling guilty about not getting him help earlier! -=-<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;help&quot; for dyslexia is help for kids to be fastened to the  <br/>
conveyor belt at school.  It has nothing to do with natural learning.<br/>
<br/>
-=- basically i just need to know at<br/>
this point how i should continue with him --=-<br/>
<br/>
Find interesting things with lots of pictures about things he&#39;s  <br/>
interested in and leave them around.  Don&#39;t put your finger under  <br/>
words if you read to him.  Don&#39;t ask him to read aloud to you.<br/>
<br/>
-=-i don&#39;t want to deny a disability<br/>
by saying - he&#39;ll learn in his own sweet time-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;...in his own sweet time&quot; is a phrase that&#39;s rarely used without an  <br/>
insult being intended.  At least a slight.  &quot;You took your sweet time&quot;  <br/>
means &quot;We&#39;ve been waiting for you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Holly was eleven before she read.   She had video games with words,  <br/>
and we would just read them to her.  She had charts that went with  <br/>
some of her games, simplified, made by me, sometimes with a word and a  <br/>
picture.   My kids all listened to a recording Discovery Toys sells  <br/>
called Sounds like Fun that was usually in our car, and sometimes used  <br/>
for a falling asleep tape.  It might be irritating for a 12 year old  <br/>
boy, but it had a song with letter sounds.   There are TV shows--I  <br/>
don&#39;t know which are current this year--such as Between the Lions and  <br/>
The Electric Company about reading.  There are some Sesame Street  <br/>
sketches about reading.  Many are on YouTube.<br/>
<br/>
Whether he &quot;is dyslexic&quot; or not (one of my kids would definitely have  <br/>
been and has all the accompanying traits:  male, left-handed, mathish)  <br/>
he can only learn to read in his own way.  Each person reads in his  <br/>
own way.  Some people&#39;s &quot;own way&quot; is marred or ruined by their trying  <br/>
to use other people&#39;s ways and feeling dumb and confused and stupid.   <br/>
Kids in school often have years of bad report cards to document that  <br/>
they&#39;re correct in that negative assessment.<br/>
<br/>
The latest reader I&#39;ve ever known is named Liam.  There&#39;s an account  <br/>
of his reading here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/r/carol">http://sandradodd.com/r/carol</a><br/>
<br/>
He grew up and joined the marines.   I learned yesterday from his mom,  <br/>
who was one of my first La Leche League leaders, that he&#39;s been sent  <br/>
to Afghanistan.<br/>
<br/>
There are many other accounts of kids learning to read, many of them  <br/>
11, 12, 13.  Liam was 16.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think that is the wrong direction to go with an older child that is frustrated already with someone else trying to teach them to sound things out.  Entertaining and fun are great!  Both of my kids have done various reading things online and via games and such and have enjoyed it.  There wasn&#39;t a goal to get them to read though.  That can be extremely problematic.<br/>
Schools use tricks like that to get kids to do all kinds of things.  It doesn&#39;t do much to help kids learn better, it only makes the medicine go down easier with that little bit of sugar.<br/>
The problem is that, kids all learn differently.  So, something of that nature may be very frustrating to a child that doesn&#39;t process the written word in that manner.  My oldest daughter didn&#39;t learn how to read that way at all!  She collected words and eventually she had enough words collected to read most anything.  That happened when she was about 11/12.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-789468304">Jenny&#39;s post with more space to read ( I hope).  I don&#39;t know what  <br/>
happened to it, but if you use the pointy carat marks (greater than/ <br/>
less than) computers think you&#39;re talking to them.  Please, for  <br/>
quoting through a yahoogroup it seems to work better if you quote the  <br/>
other person&#39;s words with **these** or -=-this-=- or something.  Thanks.<br/>

--------Jenny&#39;s responses, from here down------<br/>
<br/>
-=-I would like to start a thread about late reading and suggestions  <br/>
for strategies. My son is 12 years old now and just learning to read -  <br/>
when reading with him and listening to him read I am finding that he  <br/>
has a lot of difficulty breaking up words into their parts (structural  <br/>
analysis) and tries to break most words up phonetically - sounding out  <br/>
each letter - so &#39;poster&#39; for example becomes &#39;p&#39;, &#39;o&#39;, &#39;s&#39;, t&#39;, e&#39; r  <br/>
- which is painstakingly slow and extrememly inefficient.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m curious as to why he is using this approach to reading.  Why is he  <br/>
sounding words out, out loud?<br/>
<br/>
-=-Of course the comprehension gets totally lost when he uses this  <br/>
approach-=-<br/>
<br/>
What is he trying to comprehend?  If he&#39;s wanting to read a book for  <br/>
pleasure, put on a book on cd or mp3 and listen together and pause to  <br/>
talk about the story when he feels like it.  If he&#39;s trying to read  <br/>
manual or instructions, read them to him, if he&#39;s having a hard time  <br/>
doing it himself. The only time<br/>
I hear about reading &quot;for comprehension&quot; is in school and test taking  <br/>
to make sure that the child has actually read the homework assignment.<br/>
<br/>
-=- - i am finding that he is resistant to me sounding it out for him  <br/>
and telling him the word or offering any strategies at all that may be  <br/>
more efficient - then the frustration sets in - on him and on me -  <br/>
agh! does anyone have any suggestions for us?-=-<br/>
<br/>
STOP!  Really, that&#39;s my biggest suggestion!  Stop doing that to him.   <br/>
It clearly causes frustration.  Frustration isn&#39;t going to help him  <br/>
read at all, it will only cement in himself why he can&#39;t do something  <br/>
that others seem to be able to do.  Maybe instead tell him stories of  <br/>
other late readers and how they figured it out and let him know that  <br/>
he&#39;ll get it and to be patient with himself.  Then, YOU, the mom, need  <br/>
to be patient too. <br/>

                  &gt;&gt;&gt;It teaches kids the sound of each letter in 1st video and then how to put the sounds together in the second one - and they are very entertaining and fun. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think that is the wrong direction to go with an older child that is frustrated already with someone else trying to teach them to sound things out.  Entertaining and fun are great!  Both of my kids have done various reading things online and via games and such and have enjoyed it.  There wasn&#39;t a goal to get them to read though.  That can be extremely problematic.<br/>
<br/>
Schools use tricks like that to get kids to do all kinds of things.  It doesn&#39;t do much to help kids learn better, it only makes the medicine go down easier with that little bit of sugar.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that, kids all learn differently.  So, something of that nature may be very frustrating to a child that doesn&#39;t process the written word in that manner.  My oldest daughter didn&#39;t learn how to read that way at all!  She collected words and eventually she had enough words collected to read most anything.  That happened when she was about 11/12.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m familiar with this style of kid&#39;s toys/learning/educational material.  I know it&#39;s not a reading program, but it&#39;s cleverly designed to sneak in reading lessons, in an appealing way to small children.  Many kids enjoy these things, even mine did.<br/>
<br/>
I was visiting another family once, and they had other guests over.  One of them was a middle school teacher.  She said something like &quot;as long as they are reading, whatever it takes to keep them reading&quot;, as if that was the only issue in regards to reading, just written word.  I was thinking, &quot;what, no fun?  No reading for a need or for pleasure or any of that?&quot; because the idea was that as long as the kids are reading then all must be good with the world.  I told her that my oldest reads manga, when she wants a good story, and this woman who teaches and interacts on a daily basis with kids 11-14 had never heard of it.<br/>
<br/>
I know that kids in elementary school jump through all kinds of &quot;fun&quot; activities to get them to read.  Games and pictures and all kinds of reading exercises designed to &quot;feel&quot; like play are forced on kids everyday.  Toy companies that create toys for the younger kids have made millions of baby toys with the alphabet all mixed in.  Why do babies need to familiarize themselves with the alphabet?  Clearly people think it will help with early reading skills and reading readiness.  Fun or not, it&#39;s there for that reason.  Otherwise a toy would be just a toy designed to do whatever it&#39;s supposed to do, or a video designed to be an entertaining story, would be just that.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that I&#39;m opposed to Sesame street or Reading Between the Lions, but the mentality behind those shows is to get kids to read, to provide reading readiness to young children in fun and palatable ways.  Schools are not exception to that mode of thinking.  What they do, is make it &quot;official&quot;.  No need to wear a mask to disguise what they do, but  many classrooms try to make all that stuff &quot;fun&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
Holly&#39;s nearly 18 and she&#39;ll still watch kids&#39; shows.   In some  <br/>
families when music, books, and programs are defined and sorted into  <br/>
&quot;kids&#39; shows&quot; and &quot;not for kids,&quot; it does make it harder for older  <br/>
kids to learn things (for younger kids too, I think).<br/>
<br/>
When Holly was little and Kirby and Marty were just starting to read,  <br/>
sometimes I&#39;d play &quot;Sounds Like Fun&quot; and if one of them started to  <br/>
object, I might say, &quot;It would be nice for Holly, though, to learn  <br/>
those songs.&quot;  And I know my kids can still sing some of the songs on  <br/>
the CD.  They were painless.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a little kid I had a horribly difficult time learning the  <br/>
days of the week.  I worked at it for a couple of years when I was  <br/>
six, seven, eight, always confusing Tuesday and Thursday.  Years after  <br/>
that my mom told me a story that made me sad and simultaneously pissed  <br/>
me off.<br/>
<br/>
When she was little her mom had taught her the days of the week by  <br/>
singing them to the tune of Yankee Doodle.  If you sing the whole tune  <br/>
(verse and chorus), you&#39;ve sung four weeks--a month.<br/>
<br/>
DAMN IT!!!!! I could have learned it that way when I was three years  <br/>
old.  WHY didn&#39;t she sing that to me?<br/>
Here&#39;s why:  She was singing it to herself at school one day at recess  <br/>
or out at lunch, on the playground, in the late 1930&#39;s, and the  <br/>
teacher thought it was wonderful, and asked her to sing it for the  <br/>
class when she came in.  My mom was mortified.  If I could go back  <br/>
before I was born and talk to those people I would have, on behalf of  <br/>
the me yet to come, asked the teacher if she couldn&#39;t sing it to the  <br/>
kids herself and not put my poor little tow-headed seven-year-old  <br/>
mother up in front of the class.  She had enough problems.<br/>
<br/>
So all my kids learned the days of the week by me singing them, to  <br/>
Yankee Doodle, while I brushed their teeth, or when we were counting  <br/>
something down like holding the gas handle down to light the pilot  <br/>
light on the furnace, or waiting for something to heat up in the  <br/>
microwave.  And the joke would be &quot;I&#39;m going to sing two months!&quot; and  <br/>
sing it twice, or &quot;one month&quot; and sing it through, four lines.<br/>
<br/>
Things like that are playing, not teaching.  But some families, I  <br/>
think, throw the information baby out with the schoolish bathwater.<br/>

phonics.  I had been in another world (Fort Worth, brand new all- <br/>
spiffy classroom at the brand new W.M.Green Elementary school) and  <br/>
that school use look-see, not phonics.   So it was new to me, but it  <br/>
was like a puzzle, and the workbooks were pretty fun, but I didn&#39;t  <br/>
like to be wrong, and I liked words.  So I argued with the teacher  <br/>
that I was right, that what I had circled DID start with the same  <br/>
sound as the monkey.  There was a spider monkey.   M, not S.   It said  <br/>
&quot;M&quot; on the top of the page.  So then there was a mug.   It wasn&#39;t a  <br/>
cup.  I explained it to her.  Cups are wider at the top than the  <br/>

<br/>
I think one of the reasons Sesame Street is so popular and has lasted for so long, is because it involves the whole wide world in the shows.  Reading is a part of the whole wide world and that seems to be the way the show works in general with all the cool stuff they present.<br/>
<br/>
Both of my kids have enjoyed Sesame Street.  I was very disappointed when friends of Chamille dissed Sesame Street in front of Margaux.  We would ask them to stop, but it didn&#39;t change the fact that they did and caused Margaux to feel silly and little to like it.  <br/>
<br/>
John&#39;s grandpa was a teacher for a while.  He always told parents that their kids would be better off staying home and watching Sesame Street at the age of 5, 6, and 7, rather than going to school.  He also always said that 8th grade was a complete waste of time and that all kids should skip that year.  His kids did.  It&#39;s always been the review year, it still may be.  He was very supportive of our family homeschooling.</div>

&gt; but it seemed too frustrating for him and then i would just leave it for a<br/>

&gt; what<br/>
&gt; it is and then when he sees it again he forgets  - he gets really <br/>
&gt; frustrated<br/>
&gt; and says &#39; why can&#39;t i remember the words?! ======<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think there has been a lot of interference, albeit well intentioned, in <br/>
this lad&#39;s process towards reading. He is now feeling badly because he has <br/>
been measured and found wanting. I know that was not the intention, but I <br/>
suspect that is what has happened. I would agree with Jenny, that the best <br/>
thing to do now is step back and just answer &quot;what does this say&quot; questions <br/>
when asked, and cheerfully read what he asks you to.<br/>
<br/>
Cheerfully, that&#39;s the point - without carrying around in your heart the <br/>
idea of &quot;Oh no, he still can&#39;t read&quot;? What is in our hearts creeps out, even <br/>
when you think it isn&#39;t obvious.<br/>
<br/>
Really, he *will* read. All is well.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been watching Jayn learning to read for several years now. She is about <br/>
to turn 10, so in the context of unschooling I can hardly even call her a <br/>
late reader, although if she were in school I suppose she would be <br/>
considered one.<br/>
<br/>
She is pretty much reading fully now, although it is still work in the sense <br/>
that she applies her attention to it rather than just automatically decoding <br/>
any English text in front of her. She learned by her own combination of <br/>
whole word recognition, memorization and checking, guessing/working out <br/>
words from the context after recognizing the first letter, and maybe, maybe <br/>
a tiny, tiny bit of sounding out.<br/>
<br/>
She is much more likely now to try sounding out an unfamiliar word to see <br/>
how it might fit into her impressive spoken vocabulary, than when she was <br/>
first beginning the process. What I find very interesting is that she has <br/>
told me that she finds reading aloud easier than silent reading, so I guess <br/>
I will be able to call her a proficient reader once I start seeing her <br/>
reading silently.<br/>
<br/>
What did I do to help?<br/>
<br/>
Provided masses of entertaining and interesting print material including <br/>
computer games.<br/>
<br/>
Read anything she wanted me to when she said, &quot;What does this say?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Read the books aloud that she likes over and over. At the moment her <br/>
favorites are The Sisters Grimm and Nancy Drew stories. She told me that she <br/>
wants me to read them many times over to her so that she will find it easier <br/>
to recognize the words when she comes to read them for herself.<br/>

If you get them, don&#39;t tell him they&#39;re super easy special-ed books.   <br/>
Maybe get them and read them aloud to him.  That&#39;s what I used to do.   <br/>
I&#39;d read them a chapter a day, and if they wanted to read more they  <br/>
could pick the book up, or lots of the kids would read them on their  <br/>
own after they&#39;re heard them once.  They were largely about car racing  <br/>
and adventures, and one was about a small plane crash and there was a  <br/>
tourniquet in the story, and we talked about that, and the dangers (I  <br/>
was always willing to stop to discuss things), and two kids in that  <br/>
class ditched school one day, went into an abandoned house, one kid  <br/>
cut his arm on glass, and the other kid did pressure and tourniquet  <br/>
and took him to the hospital, which was just a few blocks away.  It  <br/>
was awesome.  The hospital praised him, I praised him, the principal  <br/>
was insufficiently impressed but I went and bragged them up in the  <br/>
office, too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think &quot;introduce&quot; is a problematic word for people trying to get  <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
People learn by picking up bits of the world here and there in  <br/>
various contexts. While sometimes we pull facts in, mainly we piece  <br/>
things together and make our own sense out of them. It would be a lot  <br/>
more efficient (for schools especially) if we naturally learned by  <br/>
absorbing someone else&#39;s understanding! But we don&#39;t. We need to make  <br/>
our own connections, make our own sense of the world. (The way we  <br/>
naturally learn is way better! Natural learning allows us to come up  <br/>
with novel ways of using and understanding the world.)<br/>
<br/>
Which is why giving kids a rich environment is important for natural  <br/>
learning. Kids need to pull sounds and words (and everything else)  <br/>
from various contexts, play with them, come up with theories about  <br/>
how they work, play some more.<br/>
<br/>
But introducing sounds and words suggests there&#39;s a way -- and a need  <br/>
-- to get those isolated, contextless pieces into kids. There isn&#39;t.  <br/>
Natural learning doesn&#39;t work that way. Natural learning needs the  <br/>
whole picture and the child will pull out whatever pieces intrigue  <br/>
him. The context is just as important as the pieces.<br/>
<br/>
Programs like Sesame Street and Between the Lions (and I&#39;m assuming  <br/>
Leap Frog) can be useful when they&#39;re like other things, swirling  <br/>
through kids&#39; lives to pay attention to or not as the interest  <br/>
strikes them.<br/>
<br/>
The problem with introducing programs to a child wanting to read  <br/>
(especially an older child) is that they seem like systems to learn  <br/>
to read. If his brain isn&#39;t ready yet, if he learns differently, if  <br/>
phonics doesn&#39;t make sense to him, they&#39;ll just frustrate him and  <br/>
make him feel dumb.<br/>
<br/>
If we could teach kids to read, schools wouldn&#39;t be struggling with  <br/>
it. There would be a handful of programs and the kids would be  <br/>
matched up with the program that fit their need and there you&#39;d go!  <br/>
What maintains the illusion that reading can be taught is that the  <br/>
lessons come at the time kids are naturally figuring reading out  <br/>
(which we only know from unschooled kids!) Sometimes kids are  <br/>
puzzling something out in their subconscious and a fact from a  <br/>
program might provide the missing piece and they get an &quot;Aha!&quot;  <br/>
moment. And schools redefine what reading is to match what they can  <br/>
get kids to do. While we might (rightly) define reading as picking up  <br/>
something you want to read and extracting meaning from it, schools  <br/>
get to define it in a way that they can say &quot;Yes, this child is on  <br/>
the path to reading.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I understand you feel frustrated, but I don&#39;t think labeling him is a good idea. If a child isn&#39;t developmentally ready to read, no amount of verbal pushing, worksheets, textbooks, or simple readers are going to change that.  Surely that causes frustration on both sides.  That is why some kids have learning disability labels.  I think teachers are offended when a child doesn&#39;t learn under their instruction, especially with all the &quot;help&quot; used.  I have never understood that belief because I had college classes in early childhood education that focused on learning about developmental skills. Those skills just cannot be hurried anymore than someone can make a child walk or talk earlier.<br/>
<br/>
I think others are offering great advice.  I have one question though.  Did your son decide he was ready to read, or have you or someone else nudged him because of his age?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1504583703">My daughter,11+, still doesn&#39;t read fluently. We unschool and it didn&#39;t  <br/>
matter to me *when* she started reading. She showed no interest in it and so I <br/>
 just let her *be*. She loves to be read to, loves books on tape and is <br/>
very very  creative. If I ever got nervous, I would just reassure myself by <br/>
talking to  other unschoolers &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;.<br/>
 <br/>
But then things started to happen. She didn&#39;t want to rejoin her groups(  <br/>
girl scouts, game days, etc) and go certain places because she was starting  <br/>
to feel *less than* because reading was mostly always needed and she <br/>
couldn&#39;t  keep up. She had, and still has, a wonderful self image and I didn&#39;t want <br/>
her  reading to affect her life, so I offered to go *with* her, mostly for <br/>
moral  support. She agreed to some things but others she let slide. But that <br/>
was her  choice.<br/>
 <br/>
The schools would probably label her dyslexic. She is definitely right  <br/>
brained and learns more through kinestetic and visual means vs auditory. But  <br/>
that is HER. That is how she learns.<br/>
 <br/>
She attended a 10 week, one day a week ,town program ( that she wanted to  <br/>
attend,cuz her friend had gone and loved it) and it allowed her to make <br/>
pictures  in her head of over 200 sight words. The program gave her immense  <br/>
confidence.<br/>
 <br/>
She IS making progress and she is happy with the progress she is making,  <br/>
which I think is all that matters.<br/>
 Texting on her phone has helped immensely, as well as instant  messaging, <br/>
and the online game Runescape ( as well as other games online). <br/>
 <br/>
She loves to cook and is reading recipes. She practices reading childrens  <br/>
books and poetry so she can then read them to her niece and my <br/>
childcare/gentle  preschool children. She loves to play Boggle, Scrabble and Banangrams <br/>
with  us, even if her words are small. She is taking ALL of it in.<br/>
 <br/>
She knows she can ask me what any word says and how to spell it. She knows  <br/>
I won&#39;t frustrate her by asking her to sound it out, etc.<br/>
 <br/>
So ..she is coming along on her terms. Will she ever be a great reader or  <br/>
speller, ? I don&#39;t now. It doesn&#39;t matter. There are so many coping <br/>
mechanisms  for people, like software, etc, that can even help in college if that is <br/>
her  path.<br/>
 <br/>
Reading and reading well has nothing to do with intelligence. Oftentimes  <br/>
children who don&#39;t have a *rich* life are only able to learn about what they <br/>
can  read, and if they can&#39;t read well it limits the info they can take in.<br/>
But there&#39;s all kinds of books on tape and videos and TV that can excite  <br/>
and expand the mind, not to mention the whole wide world! But we, as  <br/>
unschoolers, know that :)<br/>

with him and listening to him read I am finding that he has a lot of  <br/>

when he  uses this approach - i am finding that he is resistant to me sounding <br/>
it out  for him and telling him the word or offering any strategies at all <br/>
that may be  more efficient - then the frustration sets in - on him and on me <br/>
- agh! does  anyone have any suggestions for us? <br/>

Yes!<br/>
<br/>
Schoolkids who can&#39;t read learn ways to cover it, dodge, get in  <br/>
trouble, fake illness, blame someone, start a fight...<br/>
<br/>
Holly just used to say &quot;I can&#39;t read fast yet,&quot; or I can&#39;t read this  <br/>
yet.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I talked to a scout leader and a dance teacher for her.  She was in an  <br/>
acting class and I said &quot;she doesn&#39;t read yet,&quot; and the teacher said  <br/>
&quot;Well, she HAS to read.&quot;  I said why?  And it turned out what she &quot;had  <br/>
to do&quot; was to memorize little speeches.  Good!  Some of the other kids  <br/>
never did actually learn them, because they could look back at the  <br/>
paper, so Holly did better with the acting parts than they did.   We  <br/>
went through the things at home that she &quot;needed to read.&quot;   And Holly  <br/>
herself asked me, &quot;Could Shirley Temple read when she was first  <br/>
acting?&quot;   I didn&#39;t think so.<br/>

I never even thought of that as preparing my kids for school.  I also sang I&#39;m a Little Teapot, Patty-cake, All the Pretty Little Horses, and lots of other kiddie type songs.  They were fun sing-song things that we clapped to and giggled about.  <br/>
<br/>
I agree that those types of cartoons may be too young for an older child, but I don&#39;t think anyone needs to use something the way it is designed, like my kids playing with the pieces of a game and the game board without having any interest in following the rules. I don&#39;t think toys, books, or videos (or anything else for that matter) need to be avoided simply because they were designed to be used in another way.<br/>

Imagine it&#39;s some time in the future - perhaps when your son is in his late teens or a young adult, maybe this time next year - and imagine that he&#39;s reading in whatever way satisfies the purpose of learning to read. Perhaps reading the daily newspaper, or the instructions for building something, or reading a book for pleasure. Whatever it is you think he needs to be able to read FOR. See him doing it. In your mind. Make it seem real.<br/>
<br/>
Now let go of all the preconceived ideas you have about what you need to do for your son to learn to read. You&#39;ve established in your mind that your son became a fluent reader. Allow your mind to suggest to you how that was achieved.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-531847516">I just wanted to say thanks to everyone for comments and insights into the<br/>
various ways children adapt reading into their lives.  And offer a bit of<br/>
encouragement to others with late readers.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have a 14 year old that still doesn&#39;t read great but is busy decoding in<br/>
his own way.  When it&#39;s something he wants to know he works on it and gets<br/>
it and moves on..same thing with reading.  The other day he read out loud on<br/>
his own (I didn&#39;t ask him to read it).  It was something pretty advanced and<br/>
I was &quot;wowed&quot; but I kept it to myself so as not to &quot;ruin&quot; the moment.  I was<br/>
surprised at his ability to read at that level having never had any<br/>
&quot;lessons&quot; and hating reading in general.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
These wow moments will come  but try not to &quot;ruin&quot; the ownership and<br/>
accomplishments of your children by overwhelming them with how shocked you<br/>
are at their ability.  I have done that so many times because I &quot;see&quot; things<br/>
in the schoolish way that I learned them.  It&#39;s not that I am so shocked<br/>
that they learned it..as I knew in my heart all along that they would..it&#39;s<br/>
more my own &quot;wow&quot; moment of realizing I didn&#39;t have to force anything at<br/>
all.  Just live and love them and provide lots of info as they want it.  So<br/>
I&#39;ve learned the hard way to quietly savor the &quot;wow&quot; moments and not spoil<br/>
my children&#39;s joy in learning when I realize they learned it totally<br/>
differently than I did (less painstakingly, even!)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The only big thing I&#39;ve done that I think has been helpful for my 14 year<br/>
old is to share with him stories about other late readers that have been<br/>
successful in their chosen fields.   And I remind all my children on a<br/>
regular basis &quot;why&quot; we unschool rather than doing things the way their peers<br/>
do in school settings.  And believe it or not most of my children&#39;s friends<br/>
are from school settings and they tell my kids all the time they would LOVE<br/>
to trade places with them or be &quot;homeschooled&quot; with them. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Hang in there.  It will come.  And thank you all for this group that affirms<br/>
the things we know in our hearts but struggle against because of how we were<br/>
forced to learn. <br/>

<br/>
I know that feeling so well!  It&#39;s especially like that when you have a child like my Chamille, who keeps things in her head.  I never know what she knows because it was all very internal.  Then she says or does something and I&#39;m wowed!  My younger daughter is much more out of her head and I get to hear and see the process a lot more.<br/>
<br/>
Something I find really fascinating about unschooled kids, is that they take it all for granted.  They know they can learn things, if you were to point it out, it would be a &quot;duh!&quot; moment on their behalf.  They don&#39;t question their knowledge like that, they own it and it&#39;s a part of who they are.  There will always be inevitable frustrations in life, and I do remember there were times for Chamille, as a late reader, that she would be frustrated, because she knew others her age could read.  It helped tremendously that she could focus on the things she was good at, and it helped a lot that we listened to lots of books on tape and cd because, book for book, she&#39;d &quot;read&quot; more than most of her peers.<br/>
<br/>
Now, though, at the age of 15, most of her schooled peers read begrudgingly and only for school assignments off a list of school approved books.  Chamille&#39;s not a huge book reader, she&#39;ll go through phases where she&#39;ll read several novels, then not read any books for months.  She reads tons online, even stories that people have written.  When she reflects back to those days right before she was truly able to read, she hardly remembers the frustration at all, she remembers all the other things she was doing.  She remembers when she was finally able to decode the written word and actually read a book and things online without help and wonders why kids in school need to be forced, when clearly it can be done without it!  Since she knows this without a doubt, she extends that logic to everything else in the whole wide world.  <br/>

Marty is that way.  He doesn&#39;t come and tell me what he&#39;s learning.   <br/>
But this morning when I woke up 3:00 ish and he had just come home (he  <br/>
heard me blow my nose and came into the office to see if I was okay),  <br/>
we talked about drugs and sleeping, and hydrocodone (I&#39;m coming off  <br/>
that, maybe too abruptly) and Ambien commercials and told me some  <br/>
about a movie he saw about &quot;the rape drug&quot; (he knew the name and the  <br/>
nickname, but I forget) and the amnesiac drug they give me at the  <br/>
dentist, and he knew more about all those things and the similarities  <br/>
and difference than I did, not because he&#39;s used them; he hasn&#39;t, but  <br/>
because he makes good connections of the information he takes in.     <br/>
We talked about how parents of young children should probably not take  <br/>
ANY sleeping aids, especially not Ambien or anything else that&#39;s a  <br/>
known amnesiac(oidal...whatever it takes to make the drug-adjective  <br/>
form of amnesia).<br/>
<br/>
Holly likes to talk about what she&#39;s learned as it&#39;s happening, and  <br/>
that&#39;s more fun for me because I&#39;m also a &quot;process by talking&quot; person,  <br/>
as people on this list must know.   :-)<br/>

So if you have a talkative kid, talk!  If you have a quiet kid, be  <br/>
prepared to be amazed from time to time and try not to make too big a  <br/>

&quot;lessons&quot; and hating reading in general. -=-<br/>
<br/>
The first time I heard Kirby read aloud, he was reading something from  <br/>
a gaming  manual or a magazine article on a game, I think, to other  <br/>
gamers, in the library.  I was in the next room and overheard it.  He  <br/>
was 14 or 15 and he read it with confidence and feeling, and they were  <br/>
all paying rapt attention.  I knew some of them knew he had been a  <br/>
later reader than they would&#39;ve expected and he was late to have  <br/>
handwriting (though he could type like crazy).  Some of them were high  <br/>
school students; some were in college.  I detected no bit of self- <br/>
consciousness or discomfort from any of them, and then realized there  <br/>
was no reason for any.  It was all in me!   Kirby was reading for a  <br/>
purpose, with an autdience, and well.<br/>
