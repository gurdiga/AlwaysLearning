<div id="ygrps-yiv-1453643361">So I was poking around the internet looking for some things, and came  <br/>
across this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It is believed that each of us is born with 9 animals who bring  <br/>
teachings and messages for greater understanding and insights for our  <br/>
benefit throughout our lifetime.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So what&#39;s the logical flaw in that statement?<br/>
Vague assertion or something... I don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s just nonsense to make a totally unqualified statement  <br/>
that pretends to be based on general belief.<br/>
<br/>
I found that because on the same site was a graphic representation of  <br/>
Gardner&#39;s Multiple Intelligences, and I&#39;m working on a page.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m always working on a page. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Is this a First People&#39;s creation story??  I know I&#39;ve heard it before, I just<br/>
can&#39;t remember to which culture it belongs... I think it includes the tale of<br/>
&quot;where shall we hide the Secret of Happiness for the humans??&quot; After much<br/>
thought it was decided to hide the Secret deep inside the human, the easiest<br/>
place to find and the last place it will be looked for ::bwg:: <br/>
<br/>
*I* like it, mostly because I love the concept of a team approach when it comes<br/>
to deities taking care of me (I&#39;m just too much for *one* to take on :::gg:::)<br/>

Well not even that if he doesn&#39;t qualify the statement as to who, and  <br/>
when, and what makes him think &quot;it&quot; is &quot;believed.&quot;<br/>
