<br/>
It&#39;s game sort of like Family Feud that helps label images more  <br/>
accurately for Google.<br/>
<br/>
For a minute and a half you&#39;re teamed with a partner to type in the  <br/>
most likely words or phrases to associate with an image. When you and  <br/>
your partner have typed in the same word -- your words are hidden  <br/>
from each other, then you&#39;re passed onto the next image.<br/>
<br/>
You accumulate points to -- accumulate points :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1656551255">I&#39;ve been playing this for a couple of years - it is a fun game. (I  <br/>
play it at &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.espgame.org/">http://www.espgame.org/</a>&gt;, haven&#39;t played Google&#39;s new  <br/>
version.) One night there weren&#39;t many people playing and I got a  <br/>
GREAT partner - I said, &quot;WOW, this person and I really think alike.&quot;  <br/>
Roxana looked at me (she was using her laptop, sitting in a chair  <br/>
across the room) and said, with an odd sound to her voice, &quot;Are you  <br/>
playing the ESP game?&quot; I said I was and she cracked up - yes, we were  <br/>
playing together, both using made-up names.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1969845124">On - and the makers of &quot;the ESP Game&quot; have a new game that I haven&#39;t  <br/>
played yet, but it sounds really fun:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.peekaboom.org/phetch/">http://www.peekaboom.org/phetch/</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Quick! Find an image of Michael Jackson wearing a sailor hat.<br/>
<br/>
Phetch is like a treasure hunt - you must find or help find an image  <br/>
from the web.<br/>
<br/>
One of the players is the Describer and the others are Seekers.<br/>
Only the Describer can see the hidden image and has to help the  <br/>
Seekers find it by giving them descriptions.<br/>
If the image if found, the Describer wins 200 points. The first  <br/>
Seeker to find it wins 100 points and becomes the new Describer.<br/>
