<div id="ygrps-yiv-196227521">This was posted on the Kentucky Homeschool yahoo group that I belong too and I thought <br/>
I should pass this sad news along in case anyone would like to help the family. My heart <br/>
goes out to her husband, children and extended family. God be with all of them.<br/>

Subject: Fellow HS mom has died.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to pass this story on because if this were my family I<br/>
would hope that my fellow homeschooling community would come to my<br/>
family&#39;s aid.<br/>
<br/>
Missey Gray, a fellow homeschooling mother, died Wednesday after<br/>
giving birth to her fifth child.  This was her 5th C-section and<br/>
after the baby was born some of the amniotic fluid got into Missey&#39;s<br/>
bloodstream and caused a blod clot which took her life.  She leaves<br/>
behind a heartbroken husband and 5 children ages, 10, 8, 5, 2, and 2<br/>
days.<br/>
<br/>
I knew Missey through a couple different homeschooling message<br/>
boards and Yahoo groups we were both members of.  She was a precious<br/>
lady full of homeschooling wisdom.  She mentored many of us and now<br/>
ministers to all in how we should never take any day with our<br/>
families for granted.<br/>
<br/>
There was no life insurance on Missey, so the expenses are going to<br/>
be big for the family.  A fund has been set up for anyone willing to<br/>
help the family out.  You can read about Missey and the fund here...<br/>

<br/>
Missey had a blog here... www.homeschoolblogger.com/Heartschooling ,<br/>
with her last entry being the morning of the day she died.  She also<br/>
started a Yahoo group called Basically Beechick.  You can check it<br/>
out here... <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/BasicallyBeechick">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/BasicallyBeechick</a> .  And<br/>
the thing I&#39;ll remember the most about Missey is that she started<br/>
another Yahoo group titled RAKmoms where moms could bless other moms<br/>
with things they just wanted to give away free of charge to whomever<br/>
could use them.  You can check it out here...<br/>
