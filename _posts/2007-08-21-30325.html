affection/affliction ::g:: I&#39;ve found it pretty easy to start and to change<br/>
at my whim. I like the addresses, too, I think xxxxxxxxx.blogspot.com is<br/>
easy to remember and easy to spell for most folks.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m a big *reader* of blogs, that helps inspire me to write... I imagine<br/>
others awaiting my postings as I await others&#39; posts. I even get a little<br/>
grumpy if my favorite folks don&#39;t blog as often as I&#39;d like. Must be the<br/>
voyeur in me :D I like doing cooking posts like so and so, I do photo posts<br/>
like another so and so :)<br/>
Kinda like a discussion list, don&#39;t post anything you&#39;re not willing to have<br/>
examined and critiqued by those who have your addy. For example, I<br/>
originally began talking about Hannah&#39;s illness experience on my personal<br/>
blog (a.k.a. &quot;the psycho chick blog&quot;) and gave the address to lots of family<br/>
members -- big mistake! I was then torn apart for the two years of posts<br/>
that had, until then, remained hidden and private. I started another blog<br/>
that is really about *our* life as a family and I keep my weird mental stuff<br/>
on the first blog.<br/>
Sometimes I feel naked when folks (mostly snippy family members and<br/>
occasional strangers) comment negatively, in that case I just blog about my<br/>
feelings about those comments and the deliver-er of those comments over at<br/>
the psycho page. Amazingly, most offenders still read my blog on a regular<br/>
basis (I have statcounter.com on both blogs so I can know generally who<br/>
reads from where and how they found me)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ideally, I&#39;d like to blog everyday... however that doesn&#39;t leave me with<br/>
much of a life to blog *about* :::bg::: Each morning, I do start out with my<br/>
coffee at the computer, reading new posts by others and possibly having the<br/>
time/inspiration/fodder/pictures for my own posts.<br/>
If I&#39;ve got lots of mental stuff going on, my psycho blog might get 3 or 4<br/>
posts in one day, just for me to reread and analyze and figger out what I&#39;ve<br/>
got going on inside me. Sometimes I go a week of just posting my horoscope<br/>
:) Sometimes it&#39;s politics or the news or celebrities (Elton!) or specific<br/>
causes I&#39;m passionate about.<br/>
I throw things onto the Hannah/Family blog pretty regularly with pictures<br/>
about what we&#39;re doing and where we are in the life/unschooling/grief<br/>
process -- nothing terribly controversial, very gramma friendly. I like to<br/>
keep my pictures on the blog, it&#39;s so easy to upload them and write about<br/>
what&#39;s going on...<br/>
On blogger, I&#39;ve been able to separate the blogs, so that you can&#39;t find one<br/>
from the other through my profile.<br/>
It&#39;s still a public blog, it&#39;s just not as easy for people to find.<br/>
It&#39;s a great adventure, these virtual journals :) Remember if it really<br/>
doesn&#39;t go well, you can always delete it. And if it *does* go well, you can<br/>
have your postings bound into a full-color, hard-cover coffee table book (I<br/>
think I&#39;ll do that for the 10th year anniversary or somethin!)<br/>
<br/>
Happy Blogging<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2102731948">I have my blog at blogspot, but briefly considered shifting it over to xanga <br/>
or livejournal or wordpress where I could lock off posts to people coming by <br/>
to peruse things I wasn&#39;t that keen on sharing with each and every person in <br/>
the virtual world. And then I decided I wasn&#39;t that paranoid.<br/>
<br/>
I think you should look around at blogs and see which ones look the way you <br/>
want yours to look. Blogspot blogs seem less text rich than some other blog <br/>
services. That is the setups of the blogs are a narrow strip with the bits <br/>
of information on the side. Xanga seems like an interesting blog service. <br/>
There is a review of the different benefits of the main services at <br/>

I have more than one blog.  They&#39;re all on Blogspot.  One I share  <br/>
with some other people, but no one has posted but me for a while.<br/>
<br/>
That one is for announcements of articles published:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://unschooling.blogspot.com">http://unschooling.blogspot.com</a><br/>
<br/>
One is about my kids and my family:<br/>

One is the lyrics game:<br/>

<br/>
The bad thing about more than one blog is it scatters things out, but  <br/>
the good thing is that those who are only interested in one aspect of  <br/>
my life don&#39;t have to be bothered with the others!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had a couple of other blogs, but blogspot is easy for me to  <br/>
understand.  I wasn&#39;t happy when I had a narrow template, but I saw  <br/>
the Schuyler had a wide one and I figured out how to switch.  It  <br/>
isn&#39;t until step two of choosing a template that you find out there  <br/>
are some wide versions of some of them.  With those, I don&#39;t have to  <br/>
reduce my photos so small as I used to have to.<br/>

Hi Jenny!<br/>
I&#39;m not an *expert* ..but my blog is at xanga.com  and I write about anything <br/>
in our life. as we feel unschooling and life are one and the same ...it&#39;s all <br/>
intertwined.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve been happy with xanga. They even offer a question of the day to get you <br/>
thinking if you don&#39;t know what to write about, but I never seem to have that <br/>
problem &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1307466115">I have had blogs with several free hosts, but currently I have one at  <br/>
homeschooljournal.net<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://homeschooljournal.net/sign-up/">http://homeschooljournal.net/sign-up/</a><br/>
<br/>
Its free, for homeschoolers, and easy to set up. Works great with  <br/>
flickr to put up photos, easy to do links and such. Lots of templates  <br/>
to choose from.<br/>
<br/>
I blog once or twice a week, usually. I write about where we go or  <br/>
what we&#39;ve done, post pictures, share funny stories...Its about our  <br/>
family- so its not like my own personal journal where I would  <br/>
complain or rant :) I have another one of those, on wordpress but  <br/>
havent posted there in ages. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://nankilicious.wordpress.com/">http://nankilicious.wordpress.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
hope that helps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1197878365">About blogs in general, be careful what you post.  I got a visit from  <br/>
the state child welfare people, remember?  (And it wasn&#39;t a big  <br/>
problem, but still... some people are nosy troublemakers.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sad when I see a blog that hasn&#39;t been touched for months or  <br/>
years, and there are some like that.  I also see some blogs that are  <br/>
just too much information, but some people use them as diaries and  <br/>
report everything they do and see and who comes over and when.  If  <br/>
you&#39;re expecting a diary, then it&#39;s not so bad.<br/>
<br/>
I try to post once a week or more but I don&#39;t always pull it off.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1485019280">For the last two years I&#39;ve blogged as a way to meet the state&#39;s<br/>
requirements to educate my children at home.  The blog was my children&#39;s<br/>
portfolio.  I loosely kept track of the fun and educational things my kids<br/>
did.  It was easy to upload pictures to and easy to send a link to the<br/>
teacher doing the review.  I just mailed her a check and she sent me my<br/>
letters for the state.  (which reminds me that I haven&#39;t sent them in yet!)<br/>
I made it a private blog for this purpose only.  <br/>
<br/>
I also have a private blog about our horses and our small farm that I keep<br/>
mostly for myself but also share with a couple of close friends who I know<br/>
are interested in our horsey news.  I&#39;ve slacked a bit on it this summer but<br/>
it&#39;s nice to be reminded to write on it more.  I love being able to look<br/>
back at what my concerns were with regards to our horses.  It&#39;s great for<br/>
record keeping and it&#39;s a great place to share pictures and videos with<br/>
friends.  It&#39;s more fun than keeping a diary to me because my diary program<br/>
doesn&#39;t have as many options and the blog is much more colorful and fun.<br/>
<br/>
I used to keep a web page and be more open about our unschooling lives but<br/>
somehow over the years I&#39;ve felt more inclined to be a bit more private<br/>
about our lives.<br/>
