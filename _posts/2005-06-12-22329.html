the &quot;great summer reading program&quot; at our local<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it depends on who&#39;s decision it is, and the reasoning behind <br/>
the decision. Our local library is having a similar program, and the <br/>
theme is &quot;Knights, Dragons, and Dreams&quot; or some such thing, the <br/>
emphasis seemed to be on fantasy and seamus is into that right now. <br/>
Every week they&#39;ll have a programs relating to the theme. I thought <br/>
seamus might like it, and give us something fun to do this summer. <br/>
He was like &quot;reading program? No way.&quot; He doesnt particularly like <br/>
to read books on his own (and when he does, its mostly nonfiction, <br/>
like those Eyewitness Books on &quot;Minerals&quot; or &quot;Robots&quot;), although i <br/>
do read to him every night (plus side of that is we are reading <br/>
books that are far more &quot;advanced&quot; than what he could read on his <br/>
own right now)...anyhow, we needed to stop by the library to pick up <br/>
a book we ordered (one of The Lost Years of Merlin series), and he <br/>
saw the display for the library program. Kids can earn one &quot;ticket&quot; <br/>
for each picture book, or two tickets for each chapter or nonfiction <br/>
book read, and save up to win prizes. He liked a couple of the <br/>
prizes, and said &quot;Hmmmm...i think i&#39;m rethinking my decision!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Is it &quot;wrong&quot; for him to want to read books solely to win a prize? I <br/>
dont think its much different than playing skiball at Chuck E. <br/>
Cheese to get a ticket to win a toy. He can choose at any time not <br/>
to do it, and if i end up reading the books TO him (which will <br/>
probably happen), i still feel its within the &quot;rules&quot; of the <br/>
program. I think for an unschooler who *knows* that they can read <br/>
the books or not, go to the program or not, buy those prizes at the <br/>
store if they decide to do that, and know that being a &quot;good reader&quot; <br/>
is not about how many books you read, or proving to anyone that you <br/>
did so, that any &quot;damage&quot; might be minimal. <br/>
<br/>
Mostly we&#39;ll be going for the weekly program, i dont think Seamus <br/>
will get too caught up in whether he&#39;s earning enough tickets to get <br/>
a prize.<br/>

<br/>
Funny that this should come up here, I just posted about it on another list,<br/>
so here is my 2 cents:<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to talk more about the reward issue, especially as it relates to<br/>
summer and school mentality.  I have a big problem with the basic premise of<br/>
Summer Reading Programs. The whole, read this many books, and well give<br/>
you stuff thing.  (Alfie Kohn has a bit to say about this in Punished by<br/>
Rewards if anyone is interested.)  Now, on the bases here, they have<br/>
shifted from a number of books to an hours of reading formula for<br/>
awarding prizes, but it still sends the message that reading is so wretched<br/>
that we NEED rewards for doing it.<br/>
<br/>
I know that I could just let it go, but it just makes me so darn mad.  I<br/>
mean why not have summer car repair programs at the base auto hobby shops?<br/>
Summer Craft marathons, summer take care of animals programs?  Its not<br/>
like reading is the only way to learn, right?  But with reading programs, we<br/>
tell them that reading is more important than other things, but still is so<br/>
difficult and unpleasant that if you suck it up and do it, youll get<br/>
stuff.  My kids will tell our beloved library lady that reading is its own<br/>
reward when she asks them if they want to sign up for a program!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
Or, get the passport and log all the hours yourself and take them to the  <br/>
library when they have enough and surpirse them with a trip to the treasure  box. <br/>
 Work the system to your advantage.  ;)<br/>
 <br/>
Truly, though, Will is savvy to the secret of those kinds of things.   He <br/>
doesn&#39;t live in a token economy in his every day life, so it&#39;s easy  to see one <br/>
when he encounters it.  He has freedom to choose to participate  or not, <br/>
knowing already that the value of reading is in the reading, not the  treasure box.  <br/>
Because he&#39;s never been to school, and he&#39;s used to doing a  thing as its own <br/>
reward, he would likely turn down something like that.  <br/>
 <br/>
Will did something out of character for him last week.  He quit his  baseball <br/>
team in the middle of a game.  It just wasn&#39;t fun anymore,  for lots and lots <br/>
of reasons, and then there was the last straw that happened  during that <br/>
game.  But anyway, the coach kept saying during the season that  if they won a <br/>
tournament, then he would buy pizza for everyone afterwards.   They never won any <br/>
of the tournaments, but they got second place once and won a  lot of games.  <br/>
Will kept hoping that their success would at least lead  to an invitation to <br/>
pizza with the team after a tournament, even if the coach  didn&#39;t pay.  It <br/>
never came.  (This attitude is part of the reason he  quit, but that&#39;s another <br/>
story.)<br/>
 <br/>
After he quit, he said, &quot;I don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to win ANY  tournaments, <br/>
anyway.  Good thing for Coach Charlie--he won&#39;t have to buy  pizza at all!&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
Will wasn&#39;t playing ball for the pizza.  He was playing ball for the  FUN of <br/>
it, even after the coaches were clearly intent on sucking all the fun out  of <br/>
it for him.  But he was looking forward to having a pizza party for the  FUN <br/>
of it.  Not how Coach Charlie was looking at it, as some kind of  strange <br/>
motivation to win.  <br/>
 <br/>
Always unschooled Will has a wall full of baseball trophies which he  <br/>
treasures--but he treasures the games he played to get them much more.   Unschooled <br/>
kids have a better chance of putting such things in  perspective.  They grow up <br/>
with the idea that the doing it is the  thing.  Rewards are just the icing on <br/>
the cake.  They have to operate  in this culture that values rewards so <br/>
much--unschooled kids shouldn&#39;t be  sheltered from it, but helped to keep it in <br/>
proper perspective.<br/>

 <br/>
Well...<br/>
At the Live and Learn conference each year there&#39;s a raffle, with things  <br/>
people donated.  Keith and I already have items in mind or ready.   We&#39;re <br/>
donating them because someone might like them and the conference can make  money that <br/>
way.<br/>
 <br/>
Should people give money to the conference&#39;s coffers just because it feels  <br/>
good?  Is giving them a chance to get a prize harmful to their  motivation?  Or <br/>
is it better motivation because of the gambling  aspect?  They might put in <br/>
lots of tickets and win nothing. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Partly I&#39;m bringing this up in a joking manner, but I just don&#39;t want  people <br/>
to oversimplify the world and say that all &quot;rewards&quot; are  evil.   It kinda <br/>
depends how cool the award is, whether it&#39;s  altogether voluntary, whether the <br/>
kid really would be reading anyway (in which  case the reward is &quot;free&quot;), etc.<br/>

I agree with your sentiment but how do you get to the point where they can<br/>
enjoy it ?<br/>
<br/>
Reading for instance is not a natural activity.<br/>
<br/>
Reading a lot to children can get them into reading for themselves quite<br/>
naturally but not all children respond and not all parents are good (or<br/>
willing) book readers !<br/>

Neither is watching television or riding bicycles or hang-gliding.  <br/>
 <br/>
Watching TV, riding bicycles and hang-gliding are all unnatural activities  <br/>
(which is questionable, too, when you bring it down to the principles) which <br/>
are  *enjoyable* because they&#39;re fun to do.  (Did cavekids hang upside down  <br/>
from tree limbs just for fun?)  If your child didn&#39;t enjoy riding bikes,  would <br/>
you be intent on &quot;getting them&quot; to?  Even if you lived in country  where <br/>
bicycles were the main form of transportation for lots of people (China  comes to <br/>
mind)?  Of course, there would be cultural reasons to want them to  *learn* to <br/>
ride a bike.  It just makes life easier to be able to ride a  bike if you have <br/>
to ride one to get what you want anyway.  These reasons  would become apparent <br/>
to the child in short order.  They&#39;d learn to ride,  for sure.  Would <br/>
enjoying it be necessary to get on a bike and ride to your  job across town?  No--you <br/>
just have to be able to do it.  You don&#39;t  have to like it.<br/>
 <br/>
Same with reading.  We can&#39;t make bookworms out of our kids.   They either <br/>
like it or they don&#39;t.  They might like it later, or not.   It&#39;s an important <br/>
skill to have, but kids are capable of discerning whether  they need it or not, <br/>
and whether it would be an pleasurable thing for them or  not.  <br/>
 <br/>
Plenty of people come out of school hating to read.  &quot;Getting them&quot; to  enjoy <br/>
it is a sure fire way to make an unschooled child feel the same way.  <br/>

Okay, I wrote that whole last post after I subconsciously added the word  <br/>
&quot;them&quot; after &quot;get&quot; in the above sentence.  After I read it again, I see  it&#39;s not <br/>
there.  I think it&#39;s the same intent behind the question.   However, it&#39;s <br/>
different if you read it literally, and I think I have a different  answer.<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;how do YOU get to the point where THEY can enjoy it?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Aren&#39;t your kids already enjoying reading?  Even if they can&#39;t do  it?  Are <br/>
you reading them peer reviewed research articles or  something?  &lt;g&gt;  Do they <br/>
enjoy reading the sign that tells them  they&#39;re just tall enough to ride the <br/>
rollercoaster?  <br/>
 <br/>
We read for information and we read for pleasure.  I frequently get  pleasure <br/>
from reading for information (this list, my son&#39;s newsletters from  Iraq).  <br/>
Reading is a tool.  I don&#39;t have to enjoy using the hammer in  order to get my <br/>
house built.  I just have to do it.  Of course, if I  really enjoyed using the <br/>
hammer, I might build a lot more things and become a  carpenter.  But it&#39;s <br/>
not necessary for me to enjoy it to get what I want  (my house built).  The same <br/>
kind of pleasure I get from reading a novel I  can get from watching a movie <br/>
or listening to it on tape.  <br/>
 <br/>
Making the enjoyment of reading a goal for unschooled kids is missing the  <br/>
point of unschooling.  You want them to enjoy their life.  Reading  should go in <br/>
the same category as everything else they might enjoy.  Lose  the <br/>
school-think.<br/>

You didn&#39;t answer my point how do they get to enjoy reading ?<br/>
<br/>
Are you saying it&#39;s purely down to how good a reader their parents are.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps their parents didn&#39;t have much education and would like their<br/>
children to do better.<br/>
<br/>
You can either learn to read from example or you can get lessons.<br/>
<br/>
Give a toddler a book to read with no assistance, how long will it take them<br/>
to read it.<br/>
<br/>
Answer, never.<br/>

Yes, in almost all instances.  I have 5 kids.  4 of them take baths because <br/>

&lt;&lt; You didn&#39;t answer my point how do they get to enjoy reading ?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You asked me how I/parent would get a child to enjoy reading.  I can&#39;t <br/>
possibly.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Are you saying it&#39;s purely down to how good a reader their parents are. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No.  You said reading to them would help but some parents can&#39;t/don&#39;t.  That <br/>
was your theory, not mine.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Perhaps their parents didn&#39;t have much education and would like their<br/>
children to do better.-=-<br/>
<br/>
They could send them to school.  There are schools all over the place.<br/>
<br/>
They could keep them home and do schoolish things to them.<br/>
<br/>
They could learn to trust that learning can and will happen effortlessly if <br/>
the environment is stimulating and supportive and free and busy.<br/>
<br/>
-=-You can either learn to read from example or you can get lessons.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Two options?  That&#39;s all?<br/>
You left out entirely they they can learn to read on their own.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Give a toddler a book to read with no assistance, how long will it take <br/>
them<br/>
to read it.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Give a toddler a book to read and lessons and example, and he STILL won&#39;t <br/>
read it.  Read it to him, but don&#39;t expect that to be all he needs to learn to <br/>
read.  And toddlers don&#39;t need to read anyway, and aren&#39;t ready to read.<br/>
<br/>
Would example or lessons help a four month old baby walk?<br/>
Would example of lessons help him talk?<br/>
<br/>
What he needs to learn to walk and to talk are the physical readiness, the <br/>
opportunity, and the encouragement.<br/>
<br/>
Reading is the same way.  Surrounded by words and people who are happy and <br/>
helpful and not shaming and worried and pressuring, reading is a desireable <br/>
thing for kids who live where reading is an everyday thing.<br/>
<br/>
-=-You can either learn to read from example or you can get lessons.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Those are not even nearly the only two options.  I have three teenagers who <br/>
read and didn&#39;t &quot;get lessons.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Did you look here at all?<br/>

Walking and talking are not at all comparable to reading.<br/>

I think it quite likely walking, even if stooped, could come about with no<br/>

There is some evidence that we have some built in vocal language ability at<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-872574992">My two don&#39;t enjoy reading.  They like the product of reading, not the<br/>
process.  They like knowing what the characters are saying in Tales of<br/>
Symphonia (the gamecube game we&#39;re playing at the moment)or what the<br/>
latest Ranger Rick can tell them about otters or what Asterix and<br/>
Obelix are saying in the balloons above their heads.  Occasionally<br/>
Simon (8) likes to read the noises that Obelix makes when he bashes<br/>
some Roman or Linnaea (5) likes to get on to Neopets and type in<br/>
series of letters and see if anyone has named a Neopet by that name,<br/>
but most of the time the reading is left to those who are more adept.  <br/>
<br/>
I love the process of reading.  I love that without thinking about it,<br/>
without being aware of anything going on I am reading words.  I can<br/>
remember when I first got glasses reading street signs and any sign<br/>
with such joy because I could, I still do that. It was interesting<br/>
living in Japan and being completely illiterate.  It didn&#39;t hinder<br/>
memuch.  It meant that if the menu wasn&#39;t in English I had to look at<br/>
the plastic food in the window (and on occasion take the waitress out<br/>
to point at what I wanted) in order to see if I wanted to eat there.<br/>
And that David (dh) had to get the receptionist who worked at the<br/>
University where he worked to write out the characters we needed to<br/>
look for on the bus we needed to take to get downtown and back home. <br/>
We were only there for a year and didn&#39;t feel any need or desire to<br/>
learn to read Japanese. We had friends who took classes and got quite<br/>
far at recognizing katakana in a few months.  Reading Japanese, or at<br/>
least a bit of Japanese, would have opened up more doors to us, but I<br/>
didn&#39;t feel the need.  Probably if we were going to stay there for<br/>
longer I would have made the effort.  David&#39;s parents lived in Japan<br/>
for 3 years though and neither of them can read Japanese, so maybe I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have invested in it anyhow.  Nobody made it fun for me, but<br/>
more importantly I didn&#39;t want to study Japanese.  I picked up a<br/>
fleeting facility to recognize the kanji specific to where we lived as<br/>
it made it easier to get home.  I can&#39;t remember the kanji at all now.<br/>
 I loved living in Kyoto though, even without the pleasure of reading<br/>
all of the street signs or store names or restaurant menus. <br/>
<br/>
I have no doubt that some day Simon and Linnaea will read.  Their<br/>
world is full of the written word and so much of what they both enjoy<br/>
is easier to do if you can read, but until they don&#39;t want me to read<br/>
for them I&#39;ll continue to, happily. I couldn&#39;t tell them how to read<br/>
anyhow, I haven&#39;t a clue how I do it.<br/>

<br/>
***<br/>
When -- or even whether -- they come to enjoy reading depends on all kinds of things.  IMO, the most basic is how they&#39;re &#39;wired.&#39;  Some people love to read and do so voraciously.  Some people are wired for numbers, or what they hear, or tactile.  Some people never become happy readers no matter what parents do to or for them to &#39;make it happen.&#39;  What is it about parents that we think we can make something happen for another person just because s/he is our child?<br/>
 <br/>
****<br/>
Are you saying it&#39;s purely down to how good a reader their parents are.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps their parents didn&#39;t have much education and would like their<br/>
children to do better.<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t recall seeing Sandra say that. I&#39;ve known people in my life who are readers, born to parents who aren&#39;t so much readers.  I&#39;ve also seen non-readers born to readers. <br/>
 <br/>
******<br/>
<br/>
You can either learn to read from example or you can get lessons.<br/>
<br/>
Give a toddler a book to read with no assistance, how long will it take <br/>

<br/>
Answer, never.<br/>
*******<br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s crap!  There are kids who read spontaneously.  Some do it because they&#39;ve seen other people reading. Some do it just because they see letters and words and have an innate need to figure out what it all means, or because it speaks to them as readers.  <br/>
 <br/>
I began reading at 4, as did my dh -- in both cases, our parents were surprised to find we could read.  The first time dh read something aloud, he was 4 and it was the newspaper upside-down across the breakfast table (his dad was reading and Gary read the folded over side). I have a friend who read at 2.  My son Andy began reading at 8, because he wanted to know what the words on the TV screen meant during Pokemon cartoons.  He would spell them out to me and I&#39;d simply tell him what the word was -- before long, he&#39;d figured out the code and began reading them out loud himself.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying that no one ever needs help to learn to read.  I am saying that the idea that without instruction no child would ever read is false.<br/>

I do!  I have three boys (20, 9 & 4) and none has shown a desire to go unbathed until he&#39;s truly funky and unhealthy.  I just toweled off my 4yo who, after wearing the same outfit since swimming Friday evening (some 65 hrs ago!), announced he&#39;d like a bath. He spent 30 minutes in the bath, and tho he&#39;d stated upon starting that he intended to put his dirty clothes back on, he asked me to bring him clean clothes.   <br/>
 <br/>
I may occasionally suggest a bath or shower to someone, but whether he takes on is entirely up to him.  I&#39;m no longer surprised when they agree, because I&#39;ve learned that really most people like to be clean and almost everyone enjoys a nice, relaxing bath -- or an invigorating shower.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know what you would consider &quot;authorative&quot;,<br/>
but my son taught himself to read at about 3.5-4.  I<br/>
was nursing him and reading a mystery book to myself<br/>
one day, and he asked me &quot;Mom, what&#39;s &#39;decapitate&#39;?&quot; <br/>
&quot;What?  Where did you get that?&quot; I asked him, and he<br/>
pointed to my page and read me a paragraph.  He had<br/>
obviouly been storing away words and sounds for a long<br/>
time, but that was the first time I actually saw him<br/>
read.<br/>

If this were true of humans as a species, there would be no written word.  At some point in time, someone had thoughts or experiences he wanted to share with others who weren&#39;t with him at that moment in time (or he&#39;d have just told them).  That desire resulted in those words being written in some fashion.  To close the loop, someone else had to figure out what those symbols meant, and reading was discovered/invented. <br/>

Are there really children alive today who NEVER see another person reading? Certainly not among unschoolers or homeschoolers.<br/>
 <br/>
Also, home isn&#39;t the only place in life with examples of how to do something new.  I&#39;ve learned and come to love many skills I had never witnessed anyone else do in real life, much less while growing up in my parents&#39; home -- everything from macrame to breastfeeding my children.    <br/>

By authoritative do you mean some study conducted by a scholarly individual?  That would be like asking for studies from doctors indicating people don&#39;t need their services.  <br/>
 <br/>
Even better than some evidence presented by an outside &#39;authority/expert&#39; on the subject, are real-life stories shared by families who post here and in other unschooling forums.  If you&#39;d rather dismiss anything non-academic as merely anecdotal, then you really are on your own for any non-traditional path.<br/>

This absolutely isn&#39;t true.  My Zach (the stinky one &lt;grin&gt;) went to <br/>
kindergarten for 3 months.  They shamed and stressed him because he wasn&#39;t <br/>
ready to read.  I pulled him out but the damage was done.....Zach refused to <br/>
even let me read TO him for over 2 years.<br/>
<br/>
Then he would occassionally let me read to him but he never watched along <br/>
with the words or anything.  He played in the floor while I read.  As far as <br/>
he was concerned, I could have been simply telling him a story that I had <br/>
made up.<br/>
<br/>
Then a couple of years ago, Zach discovered Yu-Gi-Oh.  He really needed to <br/>
learn to read to play the game....there is simply too much to remember.  So <br/>
he did.<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t practice, he didn&#39;t have lessons, he would occassionally ask what <br/>
a word was but that was it.  He taught himself.<br/>

&gt;&gt; What he needs to learn to walk and to talk are the physical readiness, <br/>
&gt;&gt; the<br/>
&gt;&gt; opportunity, and the encouragement.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Reading is the same way.  Surrounded by words and people who are happy <br/>
&gt;&gt; and<br/>
&gt;&gt; helpful and not shaming and worried and pressuring, reading is a<br/>
&gt; desireable<br/>
&gt;&gt; thing for kids who live where reading is an everyday thing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But you haven&#39;t answered my point, what about where reading is not an<br/>
&gt; everyday thing ?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Walking and talking are not at all comparable to reading.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think it quite likely walking, even if stooped, could come about with no<br/>
&gt; assistance or example.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There is some evidence that we have some built in vocal language ability <br/>
&gt; at<br/>
&gt; birth.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Left to themselves no one will ever learn to read.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

How about the evidence of our own experience? Not authoritative enough? <br/>
First-hand knowledge?<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s funny. I&#39;d forgotten that there were people who hadn&#39;t seen it <br/>
happen many times over. Many people here have kids who learned to read <br/>
without instruction. I have three of them. One of them read at 3 years <br/>
old (almost 4) and certainly had NO instruction - since nobody in the <br/>
family even knew she COULD read until a neighbor mentioned it to us. <br/>
One read at 8 and had no instruction because I had no doubt she&#39;d read <br/>
when she was ready - she is a very physically active kind of kid who <br/>
was very busy developing other aspects of her mind and body. The other <br/>
read at 4 1/2 or so and without any formal instruction - just given the <br/>
opportunities of a print-rich environment. I personally know kids who <br/>
have read at 3 and kids who have read at 12 - none with formal <br/>
instruction.<br/>
<br/>
I think you need to go have a look at the evidence that has been <br/>
collected on Sandra&#39;s site.<br/>

<br/>
All I can add here that&#39;s concretely constructive is to say &quot;really pay attention to what they enjoy&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;ll add one of my favorite anecdotes that when my son was first reading independently, he would bring his book and lean up against me on the couch, so that we were cuddled up in the same way that we were when I read TO him.  I don&#39;t know if he assumed that you HAD to sit that way to read, or if he just found it comfortable or comforting to be cuddled up.  (I&#39;ll ask him.)<br/>
<br/>
Goals and pressure take the fun out of reading.  That&#39;s why we&#39;re spending so much time and so many sentences warning you away from that approach.  (We repeat it a lot to make sure that even people who are skimming, or only reading once a week, still get the point.)  (It&#39;s not personal.)<br/>
<br/>
My son is really auditory.  He really likes to hear a book, not look at it.  I still read to him a lot, much more than he reads to himself, even though he is eleven.  (I think my Hagrid-voice is getting really good.)  And believe me, he picks the books not me.  I actually know a tremendous amount about children&#39;s books, and my friends kids like my recommendations, but HE is the one who knows the most about what he likes.<br/>
