<div id="ygrps-yiv-1289552107">As I was cleaning the bathroom today, I had random thoughts in my mind.  I thought about how I liked cleaning the bathroom and how my husband likes to do the laundry.  It doesn&#39;t mean we don&#39;t stick to just those things, we have developed preferences over other jobs (I hate the word chores) in the house.<br/>
<br/>
So then I thought about how my children have never had specific jobs in our home.  I had other parents tell me that my children would never learn to do chores if I didn&#39;t make them work.  They would never learn responsibility and perseverence if I didn&#39;t give them things to do that taught those lessons.  I&#39;ve always tried to argue my position by explaining how I was never asked to do things I didn&#39;t like while growing up.  The responses I hear are that I am obviously an exception but not to expect my children to learn without being taught.<br/>
<br/>
That led me to thinking about the &#39;buts&#39; I&#39;ve heard since I discovered unschooling.  I feel they are an obstacle not only to parenting with a peaceful attitude, but also to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I hear, &quot;Oh, I unschool...&quot;<br/>
but I have to make the kids do chores because I can&#39;t do them all myself.<br/>
but I do think it&#39;s important to teach reading, or formal math, or whatever subject.<br/>
but I don&#39;t let my kids play video games, or watch tv, or have electronics.<br/>
but we have reading time every day because I want them to appreciate good books.<br/>
and others, I&#39;m sure.<br/>
<br/>
When looking back to the first 10 years I have been a parent, I remember being negative enough that I often thought about how sad I was all the time.  It&#39;s like I had very little joy in my heart when I was certain being a parent would make me happier than I was before.  One of the obstacles I&#39;ve had to face is letting go of those `buts&#39;.  I still catch myself thinking them occasionally but I&#39;m happy to say that they are few and far between.  I have learned not to depend on my children, or anyone, for my own happiness.  It&#39;s kind of nice to like myself.</div>

There are plenty of people who won&#39;t touch a piano because they were  <br/>
forced to take lessons, people who were forced to chop wood who just  <br/>
seal their fireplaces up when they&#39;re grown up rather than ever cut  <br/>
wood again.  Forcing, &quot;making&quot; and &quot;have to&quot; aren&#39;t the road to joy or  <br/>
choice.<br/>
