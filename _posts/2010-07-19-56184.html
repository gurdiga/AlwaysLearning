<div id="ygrps-yiv-1059741640">&quot;The list is about ideas, not about people.<br/>
&quot;Think of ideas like balls and the list like a ball court. If someone  <br/>
tosses an idea worth discussing into the court it&#39;s going to get  <br/>
batted about. At that point what&#39;s going on is no longer about the  <br/>
person who tossed the idea in. It&#39;s about the idea and how well and  <br/>
cleanly it&#39;s being tossed about. (Unless the tosser keeps jumping in  <br/>
and grabbing the idea ball saying &quot;Mine!&quot;)<br/>

I&#39;ve asked before and received no response.  Those who have joined the  <br/>
list recently, did you receive an introductory letter?  Did it have  <br/>
the text of this page?<br/>

It&#39;s also on a file linked from the main page of the list.<br/>
