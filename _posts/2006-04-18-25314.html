<div id="ygrps-yiv-2124674000">We&#39;ve talked about my dd8&#39;s clinginess but I&#39;ve noticed something in <br/>
the past few days that sheds a new light on things.  My ds9 is now <br/>
doing more of that as well.  His way of being affectionate is to <br/>
come up to my husband and I and bump his head against our bodies.  <br/>
He hasn&#39;t really hugged us since he was a preschooler.  But lately <br/>
he&#39;s spending time sitting in my lap, throwing his arms around my <br/>
neck, and even telling me he loves me!  It&#39;s awesome!  Last night, I <br/>
was laying in bed (dealing with a bad back) and the two of them were <br/>
snuggled up on either side of me as we watched tv together.  I can&#39;t <br/>
even remember the last time we were that close as a group.<br/>
<br/>
As I fell asleep last night, I pondered the changes we&#39;ve made in <br/>
our home and also our awesome discussions.  I think perhaps my son <br/>
feels freedom in expressing boredom (which he&#39;s been doing while <br/>
he&#39;s being affectionate) because he now understands I&#39;m not going to <br/>
try to cure his boredom by suggesting schoolwork.  He&#39;s also <br/>
venturing out with verbal remarks that I thought would take longer <br/>
to see.  For example, yesterday since I was stuck in the bed all <br/>
day, I suggested we read a chapter or two in our current read-<br/>
aloud.  He reluctantly admitted he wasn&#39;t in the mood to listen to <br/>
me read aloud and I realized he was afraid I&#39;d insist.  Instead, I <br/>
just laughed and hugged him and told him I appreciated him being <br/>
honest and that if he did feel like having me read aloud later, to <br/>
just let me know.  How simple it was to have a joyful moment, when <br/>
in the past that situation would have been the beginning of a power <br/>
struggle.  So I then did a remarkable thing, remarkable for me at <br/>
least, and suggested to the kids that if they didn&#39;t have an <br/>
interest in hearing the rest of the story at a later time, to please <br/>
let me know so I could just finish the book alone.  I assured them <br/>
it was perfectly okay to not be interested as no one likes every <br/>
single book they read.  Yet they both insisted I not read alone but <br/>
to wait until they were ready to join me.  I would have been happy <br/>
either way.  So I found a different book to read and they played.  <br/>
And even though I was stuck in the bed, we still had a great day.  :)<br/>
