In some of my relationships with non-unschooling friends, I find that<br/>
spending time with *just* the friend - without our children - is the way to<br/>
go.  I often go out once a week in the evening to a local coffeeshop with<br/>
friends who are available, and it&#39;s a &quot;girls&#39; night&quot; type of outing.  We<br/>
don&#39;t talk about kids (much), the conversations drift towards other things.<br/>
I have friendships that have fallen away, because we&#39;re running out of<br/>
common ground and the time spent together isn&#39;t enjoyable.  I find that<br/>
these things usually resolve on their own, gradually over time morphing into<br/>
a different relationship.  I&#39;m finding new friends who unschool and that<br/>
aides my transition and keeps me from feeling alone and isolated.<br/>

My best friend is far from parenting the way I do.<br/>
I love her. We have been friends for 30 years. We don;t talk much about the kids because I do not want to <br/>
get into that with her. We have differences in that aspect but we have other parts of our lives that we have a lot in common.<br/>
Some friendships will end because of it if there is nothing else in common between you two.<br/>

<br/>
I knew for sure I was putting my relationship with my children first  <br/>
when I let some longtime friendships slip peacefully away rather than  <br/>
deal with any disdain or explanation to people who didn&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday Holly and I went to a bridal shower in a nearby town.  I  <br/>
knew almost everyone there; only a few knew Holly and some hadn&#39;t seen  <br/>
her since she was a baby.   The bride to be is older than I am.  She&#39;s  <br/>
lived with the same man for 35 years, but they never were married.    <br/>
Most of the guests were older than I am.  The &quot;younger&quot; ones were in  <br/>
their 40&#39;s.  Then there were two teens whose mothers were there.<br/>
<br/>
I asked Holly, before we went, to go easy on any talk or jokes of  <br/>
children.   The party organizer is married and childless.  The hostess  <br/>
was never married but I think she would like to have been.   The bride  <br/>
to be has had a pituitary tumor for many years, and couldn&#39;t have  <br/>
children because what they&#39;re giving her to control the tumor couldn&#39;t  <br/>
be taken during pregnancy.  She would&#39;ve made a great mom, without  <br/>
that.  She was pregnant once, by accident, and had to choose.<br/>
<br/>
It was basically fifteen old hippie women, almost all childless, and a  <br/>
few friends and relatives.  That would have been my crowd had I not  <br/>
had children.  That WAS my crowd before I had children.  The bride to  <br/>
be was my bridesmaid when I got married 25 years ago.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If I only had friendships with unschoolers, I&#39;d have a very limited group of<br/>
friends that I saw infrequently. I find that I can discuss parenting with<br/>
most of my friends. Our styles differ, but I find that we are pretty<br/>
tolerant of each other. In groups I tend to avoid people who interact with<br/>
their children (or adults) in ways I find upsetting. I avoid people who are<br/>
disrepectful or who don&#39;t listen. I avoid people who react instead of<br/>
responding. I do judge other parenting styles, but I keep my judgements to<br/>
myself and talk about things with the other 2 mommies here if I need to<br/>
discuss something.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s kind of weird for me though. I have a few, very long-standing<br/>
friendships (over 25 years) and I don&#39;t think those friendships will ever<br/>
end. My oldest friends live in NYC, and I haven&#39;t lived there in 17 years.<br/>
Only one of those people has children. He and I have always had &quot;ideological<br/>
differences&quot; (for lack of a better term at the moment). We have long since<br/>
learned how to discuss them and find common ground or let them drop. I don&#39;t<br/>
see him parent on a day-to-day basis, so our parenting styles/lifestyles are<br/>
not an issue. My friend Jo visits at least once a month. She is single and<br/>
childless. (Yes, I am using that word deliberately. If she met someone she<br/>
wanted to marry, she would marry and have kids. She even thought about<br/>
having kids on her own, but her current living situation makes that<br/>
impossible.) She would not be an unschooler never mind a radical unschooler,<br/>
but she respects and supports our choices even if she does bring the kids<br/>
educational materials. To her credit, she doesn&#39;t care if they use them or<br/>
not. She is wonderful in that she listens to the guys and follows their<br/>
desires when she&#39;s here.<br/>
<br/>
I rarely see my friends from New Orleans. (We left New Orleans the day<br/>
before Hurricane Katrina and then settled in Connecticut.) The friendships<br/>
we were building there were interrupted by the hurricane in a way I&#39;m too<br/>
tired to explain right now.<br/>
<br/>
We have only been in Connecticut for 3 years and have met a number of<br/>
homeschoolers, most of whom we don&#39;t socialize with outside of groups<br/>
events. In the groups we do attend at least twice a month, there are a few<br/>
people who don&#39;t even understand unschooling. I&#39;ve been told, &quot;Well, even<br/>
unschoolers use workbooks and some cirriculum.&quot; Even when they ask about our<br/>
day-to-day lives, they just don&#39;t hear that I don&#39;t teach my guys. I model<br/>
things for them, explore things with them, and participate in their learning<br/>
on their terms.<br/>
<br/>
I wish we could socialize with more radical unschoolers on a more regular<br/>
basis. So far, our attempts at making spaces for that to happen haven&#39;t<br/>
worked out, but we&#39;re still working on it. :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really grateful for the people I&quot;ve met at conferences and those I&quot;ve<br/>
met on-line. People like you Kelly :)<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea if that answered your question, but it was interesting for me<br/>
to puzzle through it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>

This is something I too struggle with currenlty.  I was just going to ask a question when I saw a response to this for some others on this group.  Somedays I feel like I have no &quot;like minded&quot; friends.  I am going to read more of the responses and come back to this later.<br/>
