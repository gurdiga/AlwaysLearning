<div id="ygrps-yiv-658945304">We are not Bob ;)   But I have a story about video/computer games that just happened this week.<br/>
<br/>
Our son has been home from school for 4.5 years - we pulled him mid third grade after being in a public Montessori school from age 3 to 8.5  He will be 13 in a couple of weeks.<br/>
<br/>
For the first time in his life he spontaneously wrote something more than a word or two - he wrote 3 whole pages!  He has a new computer game called &quot;Rome Total War&quot;.  He is a war history buff - very passionate about it.  He loves anything from ancient times to modern.  He likes all aspects of war - the history (circumstances), the weapons & armor, the strategy, etc.  Anyway I sat down to the computer yesterday and there sat 3 pages stapled together.  He had written about the results of his campaign / battles.  He wrote on a blank page (no lines) and all his physical writing was legible and in straight rows.  Most of the spelling was &quot;off&quot; but who cares ? ;)   All this from a child that is severely dyslexic/dysgraphic who usually resists even writing his own name. (like when you&#39;re sending a card and he does not want to sign it so you have to sign for him)<br/>
<br/>
The biggest caveat is that we almost did not buy that game last week due to money.  We have budgeted for one game or some such big expense a month.   Being it was the first of the month, not the end, the money was not really there, but the moment was.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
My question for the group is this - he asked me to read what he wrote out loud - and then asked how he did - if it was readable and if he had spelled the words correctly.  I just about swallowed my teeth!  I was so worried about squashing his &quot;spirit&quot;.  I think I did a pretty great job of reading his writing as most of it just made sense to my brain - I think I missed one word out of three pages -  for example he spelled men as min; my as mi; held as hild;  first as frst; couple as copl; etc.  But when he asked about his spelling I was not sure how honest to be.  I think I said something about how he did a great job spelling phonetically and that made reading it easy for my brain - that there were a few words here and there that were spelled wrong or spaced wrong ( for example he wrote hon drid for hundred) and that if he was ever interested I would help him with spelling - to just let me know.  He informed me that he had already enlisted his dad (who is the stay at home person).  He had his dad rewrite it so he could compare dad&#39;s to his to see how well he did.<br/>
<br/>
Suggestions on how to handle it when kids ask for your opinion on what they did ?  Don&#39;t want to crush his spirit nor be dishonest.<br/>
<br/>
Also reading to play games and manuals and Japanese anime books (like a comic book in book form) has been what our son has used to hone his reading and writing (typing/spelling) skills.  Rune Scape was a huge catalyst !!!!!!!!!!!!!!  But I&#39;d be remiss if I ignored the importance of the role of TV and movies in inspiring reading for our son.  TV & Movies, games, and books are all intertwined in our home - pretty much they all hinge upon each other.  For example: He played a Wii game at a friends home that he was obsessed with.  Because we did not have a Wii system, he got the game manual and read it in preparation for when he did have a Wii.  We also have a house full of books he just had to have but has never read based upon his interests or some movie he has seen - he just had to have the Chronicles of Narnia trilogy and even carried it around for at least a month every time we left the house but I swear he never read any of it (maybe I just don&#39;t know - LOL)  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi, Lisa<br/>
<br/>
Whenever I talk to my son about his spelling - which isn&#39;t very <br/>
often - I always use the term &#39;standard spelling&#39; to describe how he <br/>
would find the word spelt in a dictionary. As in, &quot;Did you know the <br/>
standard spelling of that word is ...?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
As far as I&#39;m concerned, keeping the &#39;lines of communication&#39; open <br/>
with my son is more important than anything else. If I understand <br/>
exactly what he&#39;s written, the spelling of individual words doesn&#39;t <br/>
matter to me and I often will let it go without comment. Any spelling <br/>
of any word is legitimate if I recognise what the word is and <br/>
understand the message. <br/>
<br/>
AND I&#39;ve told my son that most people in our society regard the use <br/>
of standard spelling as a sign of an intelligent, well educated <br/>
person. Rightly or wrongly. It&#39;s up to him what he does about that. :)<br/>
<br/>
Another thing I&#39;ve told him is that standardised spelling is a fairly <br/>
recent development and it&#39;s not that far back in human history that <br/>
almost everybody spelled words as the words sounded to them, so <br/>
spelling words the same way as most other people do isn&#39;t exactly up <br/>
there with our biological imperatives. I read one time, in fact, that <br/>
England&#39;s literary giant William Shakespeare even had at least six <br/>
different spellings of his own name!<br/>
<br/>
When I was at primary (elementary) school, I was a stickler for <br/>
correct spellings - I would be mortified if I got an incorrect answer <br/>
in the weekly spelling test. These days, I read about or see schooled <br/>
and homeschooled children participating in spelling bees and taking <br/>
this attitude that it&#39;s the most important thing on planet Earth to <br/>
be able to spell &#39;correctly&#39; words they&#39;ll never use in their daily <br/>
affairs, and I wonder what the heck that&#39;s all about. I still am a <br/>
stickler about using standard spelling, for myself, but I know it&#39;s <br/>
not as crucial as good communication is. <br/>
<br/>
I know of plenty of people who can write with perfect spelling, <br/>
perfect punctuation, grammar and syntax, but who don&#39;t communicate. I <br/>
do that myself sometimes. LOL<br/>
<br/>
In terms of opinions generally, I make it personal - &quot;I like that&quot; <br/>
rather than &quot;That&#39;s good&quot;, for example, because it is only my <br/>
opinion - and I *will* find something to like. There always is <br/>
something to like or something to build on.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1092330712">Thank you Bob - I like the terminology &quot;standard spelling&quot;  vs. correct way or right way.<br/>
<br/>
I do not comment ever unless he asks me - it&#39;s just that he was asking and I did not want to crush him but neither did I want to lie.<br/>
<br/>
Here is why I&#39;m so worried about crushing him as he blooms into writing on his own:<br/>
<br/>
Weekly spelling word lists of 20 words were one of the driving forces to our pulling from Public Montessori - basically we were thinking there had to be more to school than weekly word lists and all homework revolved around that.  You know where every Monday they had to write each word five times, Tues. use every word in a sentence, Wed look them up in the dictionary and write the definition, etc.    We&#39;d work all the time on the lists and then he could not write fast enough to keep up so he&#39;d be on about the 5th word and the teacher would be on word 25 - needless to say he would fail every test after a week of nothing but total focus. YUCK!!!!!!!!!!!! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-458355060"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;These days, I read about or see schooled<br/>
&gt;&gt;and homeschooled children participating in spelling bees&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And what I found as a school teacher was that some kids spell &quot;standardly&quot;<br/>
well, and some don&#39;t, even with all the kids getting the same spelling drill<br/>
every week (I never did that).<br/>
<br/>
The principles remain the same...kids absorb what works for them and are<br/>
better at some things than other things (multiple intelligences). In general<br/>
those who conventionally spell well tend to be the ones who are visual<br/>
learners and remember the spelling of words from seeing them. That is only a<br/>
certain percent of the population, whether schooled or unschooled. Though<br/>
unschooled kids have a much better chance of finding their own ways and<br/>
means to spelling.<br/>
<br/>
In our home, we tended to use the catch-phrases &quot;inventive spelling&quot; or<br/>
&quot;phonetic spelling&quot; when my kids asked about how they did with spelling<br/>
things. It was just as exciting to see a word spelled the way it sounded as<br/>
it was to see it spelled in standard form! It shows true intelligence and<br/>
logic to be able to sound out a word!<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s NOT logical is the spelling of so many of our English words. Those<br/>
who can&#39;t memorize from visual input have a harder time with conventional<br/>
spelling. And we acknowledged that! It&#39;s just kind of a fact of life as<br/>
opposed to anyone missing anything.<br/>
<br/>
I remember great discussions about the structure and history of different<br/>
words based on my kids&#39; inventive spelling. If they wanted to see the<br/>
conventional spelling of a word they wrote, we could laugh at how the word<br/>
sounded compared to how it was spelled, or notice how close it was, or see<br/>
how that little &quot;e&quot; at the end could change everything! I remember looking<br/>
up the origin of words, which sometimes lead to discussions of culture,<br/>
world history, etc. And sometimes didn&#39;t :o) But, the structure of words can<br/>
be so dang interesting!<br/>

Yuck, yes.<br/>
<br/>
Each time you can take a memory like that and pack it up, tie it off,  <br/>
give it a little blessing and bye-bye, you&#39;ll clean out more room to  <br/>
be calm and peaceful with your son now.<br/>
<br/>
Not only does that not have to happen anymore, but you don&#39;t have to  <br/>
recite it (even mentally) anymore.<br/>
You can turn away from it and let it dissipate.<br/>

Instead of getting mad at the words, we just look up why there&#39;s a  <br/>
silent letter.  It wasn&#39;t always silent.  Words are some of the best  <br/>
antiques we have, and as English is so visual, it helps when people  <br/>
are &quot;reading silently&quot;  that words are different visually.<br/>
