<div id="ygrps-yiv-1999777424">The list description was changed.  So though Anne once thought it  would be great to have a list for  non-typical, out-of-sync, highly  sensitive, Aperger&#39;s explosive, etc., as the list gained speed and the  moderators gained experience, they decided maybe that was not a good  <br/>
<br/>
idea after all.  Just as others had said before that list was formed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
****<br/>
<br/>
I find that Anne&#39;s list is a good place for talking about non-typical or highly sensitive responses to situations, often from a perspective of both children and parents who are highly sensitive or non-typical.  That list, and Anne&#39;s writings, were tremendously helpful to me in understanding myself and my own responses/reactions to my kids and has made such a difference in the Mom I am today.  <br/>
<br/>
I do sometimes find that Always Learning is not a good fit for me in my more sensitive moments (when I&#39;m slogging thru my own personal issues).  Since those are the moments when I&#39;m mostly likely to do something that complicates my kid&#39;s life, I need somewhere I can go to get ideas I&#39;m actually willing to hear (sometimes the answers here hit me wrong, and I know that&#39;s about me not about the person posting here).  I&#39;m on both lists because sometimes I need stark honesty and I can withstand it; other times I need to hear from people adept at talking about what it means to be highly sensitive, both as a child or an adult. Sometimes highly sensitive children become highly sensitive adults (I did!) and that&#39;s okay, too.     <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t find labels useful in unschooling either. We recently revisited that decision for one of our children, which turned out to be a wonderful conversation starter for us all, and helped us find more solutions as we all grow and change.  Ultimately, we again decided not to seek a label.  But if we&#39;d been completely unwilling to ask that question, we&#39;d have missed a very important conversation with our son.  I think, too often, having a label lets parents off the hook -- rather<br/>
than coming up with more creative solutions to really reach and help a<br/>
child, parents can just chalk it up to his &#39;disorder&#39; get some expert<br/>
help, give him a drug or two, control his behavior and ignore the<br/>
child&#39;s very valid needs. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m often more sensitive to some situations than most people I know.  Not surprisingly, so are my children, each in his own way and to varying degrees. Looking around my family tree, I&#39;m not unlike other people who came before me.  I&#39;m certain there&#39;s a genetic component to it.  I, too, find that when I&#39;m wanting to &#39;fix&#39; my kids, it&#39;s that I&#39;m seeing something in them I don&#39;t/didn&#39;t like in myself.  <br/>
<br/>

People could join that list and have people deny it was ever intended  <br/>
<br/>
to be a special needs list, or they could stay here where people have  <br/>
<br/>
been saying for much longer that labelling children causes problems.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
<br/>
Or people could join Shine, and stay here too, enjoying and benefiting from the abundance of perspectives and voices offered in both places.  I think it&#39;s like finding more resources for our families as unschoolers -- the more options, the better.  <br/>
