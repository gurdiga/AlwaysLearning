<div id="ygrps-yiv-1087963483">I would also volunteer to be in the &quot;classroom&quot;. I&#39;ve done it many times. My <br/>
son is 12 and still not at all comfortable with writing. Even within the <br/>
dreaded school system, they recognize that there are many different levels <br/>
of ability, especially in the reading/writing stuff at age 8. If your son <br/>
can make up a &quot;sentence&quot; like &quot;A bat is echolocation&quot;, I think he&#39;ll do <br/>
fine. I&#39;m very impressed.<br/>
<br/>
Be sure to take away any power they might have to shame him by reminding the <br/>
zoo staff that this is not school. Talk to them beforehand about how you <br/>
wish your son to participate. You&#39;re probably paying for the class, right? <br/>
You should be able to ask that he get from it what you want. And then run <br/>
interference for him as a volunteer. He sounds brilliant. :o) Could he come <br/>
over and teach ME some stuff about zoo animals? ;-)<br/>
