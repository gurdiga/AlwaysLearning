<div id="ygrps-yiv-490144899">Pat,  your spitting four year old story made me chuckle.....because when I<br/>
was 3,  new nieghbors moved into the next door house.  As I watched them<br/>
carting stuff up the riveway,  thay gave me a friendly &#39;hello, little girl.&quot;<br/>
Well, I spit at them.<br/>
    Personally,  I don&#39;t remember this,  but since they still live there,<br/>
they remind me of it EVERY time I go visit -LOL-(they and my parents still<br/>
live there.)  We all laugh about this ...they claim to have shrugged it off<br/>
and joked with my parents about it.  Anyway,  people who know me now...and<br/>
most of my older childhood on,  would have a hard time imagining me being so<br/>
incorrigible!<br/>
