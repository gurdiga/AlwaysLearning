If you practice attachment parenting then this is the group for you.<br/>
This is a<br/>
group where AP moms can make friends, share advice, and offer support.<br/>
If you<br/>
homeschool, unschool, wear your baby, care about a healthy lifestyle,<br/>
are unsure<br/>
about the safety of vaccines, co-sleep, and parent through instinct,<br/>

love to have you in the group!<br/>

This list is for mothers who are Vegan or Vegetarian, although our focus<br/>
will be on<br/>
Veganism. This is the place to talk about nutrition for children and<br/>
families, ethical<br/>
treatment of animals and other aspects of being Veggie. Discussion may<br/>
include<br/>
AP parenting, homeschool and natural lifestyle. This is not the place to<br/>
debate<br/>
over religion so please just don&#39;t bring it here. Let&#39;s just talk about<br/>
our children<br/>
and being Mums!!!!<br/>
