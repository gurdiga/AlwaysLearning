<div id="ygrps-yiv-741408108">Thought I&#39;d  re-post regarding my new Yahoo group for grandparents called<br/>
GRANDleap (a take off from <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/L-E-A-P">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/L-E-A-P</a> )  I<br/>
already have 33 members (two of whom are granddads) since August 22. I just<br/>
wanted to remind everyone to ask your parents if they&#39;d like to hop on<br/>
board. Us old folks are having some interesting conversations. It doesn&#39;t<br/>
matter where they are in their thinking. We are all here to support each<br/>
other. Here&#39;s the link, thanks!  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/GrandLEAP">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/GrandLEAP</a><br/>
