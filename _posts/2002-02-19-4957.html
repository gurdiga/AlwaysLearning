<div id="ygrps-yiv-23542891">Hi Pat,<br/>
I offer stuff all the time.  I offer anything I think he&#39;d be interested<br/>
in, anytime something comes up.  He&#39;s free to say no thanks.  I offer<br/>
stuff I&#39;m interested in.  I&#39;m taking a painting class and sometimes he<br/>
comes, sometimes not.   His dad offers all kinds of things.   He may not<br/>
have thought of a trip to the hardware store, but it&#39;s offered and he<br/>
goes and sticks all the plungers to the floor while his dad buys nails or<br/>
whatever.   <br/>
I really don&#39;t wait for Dylan to say he has an interest in something.  If<br/>
I know of the interest, I try to find ways to feed it.  If I have things<br/>
I want to do I invite him to join me.  <br/>
This weekend there were snow machine races at a lake about forty miles<br/>
away.  We don&#39;t have machines and Dylan&#39;s never been on one.  We went,<br/>
watched the races, played in the snow,  had fun.   We drove around the<br/>
lake and talked to ice fishermen and Dylan slithered on his belly on the<br/>
ice to peer down the fishing holes.   He got to see a guy use his power<br/>
auger.  He pelted me with snowballs.<br/>
We stopped and jumped in snow drifts to see how deep they were. (they<br/>
were deep)   We played with someone&#39;s big smelly dog.  We stopped in a<br/>
new place and warmed up and had dinner.   Dylan didn&#39;t know there was a<br/>
race, he never could have asked to go.  He had a great time because we<br/>
&quot;offered&quot;   <br/>
Try not to worry and just have fun.  <br/>
Hey, put a cd in the microwave!  Now that&#39;s fun!  (but don&#39;t leave it too<br/>
long, they catch fire )   Buy that popcorn on the cob and microwave it, <br/>
totally cool! <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;Child led&quot; isn&#39;t one of my criteria.  Lots of people like to say that, but I <br/>
think it&#39;s too one-sided.  The questions above are too technical, too <br/>
&quot;measured,&quot; too clinical.  Maybe you have to start that way to get the feel <br/>
of it, but ANY counting is ultimately wrong.  Once you&#39;ve played with the <br/>
kids and interacted with them and get in the habit of doing that, you will as <br/>
a group move from one thing to another more naturally.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to suggest going somewhere, don&#39;t worry if you&#39;ve done it every <br/>
day all week, or not for the past month.  It should be the going and doing <br/>
which are the focus, rather than the calendar and the initiator.  <br/>
<br/>
If there&#39;s a game or activity at home you&#39;re interested in doing, get the <br/>
stuff out.  See if a kid asks.  Or ask if they want to play a game after <br/>
lunch.  Don&#39;t just listen to the words, look at their eyes and faces and body <br/>
language and tone of voice.  If they&#39;re grudging, start playing but be <br/>
willing to quit after a game or two.  If they&#39;re enthusiastic, consider <br/>
playing longer, or learning another version of the same game.  But be aware <br/>
as things unfold whether it&#39;s still fun for everyone involved.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Would be&quot; is so hypothetical.  Instead of planning for the future, offer <br/>
something today and see what their reactions are.   Refine your unschooling <br/>
as you go.  You can&#39;t plan today what you&#39;re going to do next Thursday <br/>
(unless it&#39;s a play or concert or people are coming over or something, that&#39;s <br/>
not what I mean).  You don&#39;t know this week what their interests will be in <br/>
July.  <br/>
<br/>
There needs to be an immersion and a natural progression, not a scheduling <br/>
and outlining in advance.<br/>

<br/>
I think the key is *offer*, with refusal being a clear choice.   I don&#39;t <br/>
think you can really schedule such things, though I understand your desire <br/>
for order.  &lt;g&gt;   I think the more choices they have, the more comfortable <br/>
they&#39;re going to be with picking and choosing.  If you only offer something <br/>
once a week, it&#39;s going to seem like a *big deal* to all of you.  If you <br/>
offer things as you notice them, maybe a bit of information or an activity <br/>
you&#39;ve read about, books and materials lying around, museum memberships <br/>
they know they can use when they want to. . . all the time letting them <br/>
know that it&#39;s *their* education, and you&#39;re only there to help.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You want &quot;how&quot; and we&#39;re trying to tell you &quot;why.&quot;<br/>
And trying to tell why &quot;how&quot; doesn&#39;t work the way &quot;why&quot; does.<br/>
<br/>
If you try the little &quot;why&quot; exercises and examples you&#39;ll develop your own <br/>
how.<br/>
<br/>
Make your decisions based on your child and your interests, not on the <br/>
calendar, or a curriculum.  Make little decisions, minute decisions, in light <br/>
of what will spark more thought and interest and curiosity and sharing and <br/>
wonder.<br/>
<br/>
At each intersection at which you have the opportunity to turn away from or <br/>
toward unschooling, choose toward.  <br/>
<br/>
Little things lead toward bigger things, and big things are made of little <br/>
things.  The little things that unschooling is made of are moments shared, <br/>
pictures, ideas, questions, words; things touched that were wet, cold, fuzzy, <br/>
sticky; shadows on mountains (there was a beautiful one today--everyone went <br/>
outside and looked), rainbows, future memories of all kinds for all senses.<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t schedule those things.  You have to turn toward them when they&#39;re <br/>
there, and not try to haul them into the house to keep forever--see them <br/>
where they are, when the moment is ripe, and let the physical moment go.  The <br/>
experience and the memory will stay.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2014378397">Your description of an unschooling life is really beautiful.  It is <br/>
so different than the impression I&#39;ve gotten from talking to people <br/>
on other lists.  Maybe it is only because now I have gotten past the <br/>
simple control issues.  Things have really settled down around here <br/>
as far as control issue fallout.  There is so much peace.  <br/>
<br/>
My new phase is to get used to being in such demand and also helping <br/>
dh think about spending more time doing things with the girls.<br/>
<br/>
Last night I came home from swimming at 10:00 p.m.  Everyone was <br/>
watching the olympics so I thought that is what they wanted to do.  I <br/>
sat and watched for a while but then got bored and went to do <br/>
something else.  That was all it took for Allison and Virginia to <br/>
come looking to do something with me.  By then it was 11:00 p.m. and <br/>
I was fading.  Allison wanted me to read to her and Virginia wanted <br/>
me to do sign language flash cards.  When I said I was tired, Allison <br/>
settled for me coming in her room and talking to her for a while and <br/>
Virginia was happy with the fact that we would do sign language first <br/>
thing in the morning.  <br/>
<br/>
My kids are such happy people.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve noticed that some kids seem to find it easier to join in to an<br/>
activity that you&#39;re already doing, they feel sort of put on the spot if<br/>
you ask them straight out. My kid isn&#39;t like this, but I know with some<br/>
other kids, if I start making cookies or magazine beads or whatever,<br/>
they&#39;ll come over and join in, but asking usually elicits a &quot;no&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
It could also be that seeing the activity in progress makes it easier for<br/>
them to decide if they want to do it or not.<br/>
<br/>
Cacie would love a fairy house There&#39;s a house we walk past on the way to<br/>
the post office that she says looks like a perfect place for nymphs to<br/>
live...<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve noticed that some kids seem to find it easier to join in to an<br/>
&gt; activity that you&#39;re already doing, they feel sort of put on the spot<br/>
&gt; if<br/>
&gt; you ask them straight out. My kid isn&#39;t like this, but I know with<br/>
&gt; some<br/>
&gt; other kids, if I start making cookies or magazine beads or whatever,<br/>
&gt; they&#39;ll come over and join in, but asking usually elicits a &quot;no&quot;.<br/>
<br/>

decline food, when offered, but the same food, put on a plate near where<br/>
he was spending his time, would be noshed on.<br/>

We also watched a video from the library.  I don&#39;t remember the name, <br/>
though it *could* have been something like building fairy houses.  It was <br/>
about a girl who went to an island off the coast of Maine with her aunt for <br/>
a week.  Maybe a librarian could help you find it.  That&#39;s what sparked <br/>
Skye&#39;s interest.<br/>
