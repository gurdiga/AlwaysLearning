<div id="ygrps-yiv-543820920">Life Learning Magazine is no more, but there&#39;s a new book with some  <br/>
of the best of recent articles, and there&#39;s one by Robyn Coburn,  <br/>
who&#39;s active on this list!  There are articles by Pam Laricchia and  <br/>
Amy Childs, too, who might be known to some of you from online  <br/>
discussions.   Amy recently sent me something for my site and I was  <br/>
working on an announcement for the UnschoolingDiscussion list, of  <br/>
which she&#39;s a member.<br/>

<br/>
Hello Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
I thought you and your unschooling contacts would like to know about  <br/>
a new book that will be published just in time for the holiday gift  <br/>
giving season.<br/>
<br/>
Life Learning: Lessons From the Educational Frontier is a collection  <br/>
of 30 essays first published in Life Learning magazine. Details can  <br/>
be found here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.lifemedia.ca/altpress/LL.htm">http://www.lifemedia.ca/altpress/LL.htm</a><br/>

======================================================<br/>
<br/>
The magazine&#39;s priorities weren&#39;t the same as the main writers on  <br/>
this list, so it will be more anti-TV and pro-organic, in general, I  <br/>
believe.  Some of you like that!  But if you want to buy a book to  <br/>
help your relatives understand what you&#39;re doing, this might not be  <br/>
the perfect one (or it might be).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-68709690">Yes, to my pleasant surprise I was invited to be in the book. I always <br/>
imagined my short essay as part of series on Rules vs Principles, because <br/>
there have been several very strong pieces written by others including <br/>
Sandra and Danielle Conger (previously published in LLM) and Ben Lovejoy&#39;s <br/>
writing on the topic (that was in Connections amongst other places). I think <br/>
the book looks quite nice, I&#39;m proud to have been included - and yet I would <br/>
also encourage anyone reading my bit, to think of it as a jumping off point <br/>
to the even better writing of others still floating around the net.<br/>
