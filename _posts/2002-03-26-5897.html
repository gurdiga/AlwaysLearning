<div id="ygrps-yiv-1577212426">I cringe a little when there is some homeschooling family being harrassed and <br/>
they call all &quot;conservatives&quot; to the battle front.<br/>
Are those raising the battle flag afraid of rallying the liberals to their <br/>
cause?<br/>
Reeks of HSLDA type of request..although I didn&#39;t see their name mentioned <br/>
anywhere.<br/>
Don&#39;t get me wrong, I feel for anyone harrassed by intrusive government, It <br/>
outrages me.<br/>
But I also get irked about the way help is called for, as though liberal <br/>
homeschoolers wouldn&#39;t be interested in parental rights or something.<br/>
