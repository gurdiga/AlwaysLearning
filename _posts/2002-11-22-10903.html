<div id="ygrps-yiv-452711856">Channeling:  Matthew says a Paladin special abilities are that they are<br/>
blessed by the gods, so they may cure a lot of damage each day, just by<br/>
touching the wounded character.  This can also be used to damage the undead.<br/>
They can detect evil w/in the vicinity at will.  They are immune to all<br/>
diseases, including magical diseases.  At second level and up they are<br/>
immune to fear and give their teammates +4 against fear.  At second level<br/>
and up a paladin may smite evil dealing extra damage and increasing<br/>
probability to hit once per day.  Beginning at third level, a Paladin can<br/>
remove disease once per week from anyone they can touch.  Every three levels<br/>
thereafter, they can do it once more per week.  When a Paladin reaches third<br/>
level, they can turn undead, ie make them turn away and run in fear of a<br/>
holy symbol.  At fourth level and up a Paladin can cast divine spells.  At<br/>
fifth level, a cleric gains a special mount, also blessed by the gods and<br/>
thus gaining more hp and higher intelligence.  A cleric must follow a code<br/>
of conduct ie remain lawful/good or be expelled as a Paladin and loose all<br/>
of the above abilities.<br/>
<br/>
He didn&#39;t have any info on Sages in his rule books.  Possibly second<br/>
edition? he says.<br/>
