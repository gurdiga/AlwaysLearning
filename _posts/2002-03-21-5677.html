&lt;&lt; What makes it a &quot;hippie college&quot;? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know about the one named, but when I went to college I went to &quot;the <br/>
hippie college&quot; here.  Of five or six large state universities, one was &quot;the <br/>
liberal one,&quot; so that they had all their liberal professors in one place.  <br/>
One was the old normal school (teacher training, in the days that the <br/>
universities were very specialized), one the old (still) aggie school, one <br/>
college of mines (which is now math and engineering in addition to mining), <br/>
one just being out in the conservative eastern plains (Eastern New Mexico <br/>
State, in Portales, New Mexico--surely you&#39;ve all heard of it &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
If you wanted to live a liberal life and go to class barefooted, the <br/>
University of New Mexico was your best choice.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why I knew so much about radical educational reform.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The hippie colleges of my experience tend to be more open to student<br/>
directed education.  UC Santa Cruz has an option where you<br/>
can create your own major.  A friend of mine is graduating this<br/>
spring in her medieval history major.  I&#39;m not sure UC Berkeley<br/>
ever had that option but at one point it was *the* hippie college<br/>
and the hippie college town.  Evergreen College in Olympia WA is<br/>
another one where students are given more control over their education.<br/>
UC Santa Cruz has been getting pressure to be like the other UCs lately<br/>
so it is losing some of its hippie status IMO.<br/>
