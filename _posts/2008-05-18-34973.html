<div id="ygrps-yiv-1704864168">My son saw a good friend recently and this boy filled him in on all of the recent events of <br/>
his life--a new girlfriend, and many other agenda items.  The sad thing about this, and the <br/>
reason my son then shared them with me, is that these life events are all secrets from his <br/>
parents.<br/>
<br/>
This boy is homeschooled by what would appear to be fairly progressive parents.  They <br/>
lived a very free life until kids turned 12, and then all of a sudden there were part time <br/>
classes at the charter school with homework requirements, etc.  And there were the rules:  <br/>
not allowed to have a girlfriend until a certain age, and many others that I don&#39;t even know <br/>
the details of.<br/>
<br/>
So he breaks the rules and just doesn&#39;t tell them.  They did find out about the last <br/>
girlfriend, and they made him break up with her.  But now there&#39;s a new one.<br/>
<br/>
His parents mistakenly believe that they have a good and trusting relationship.  They have <br/>
&quot;good&quot; kids and it&#39;s their duty to guide their kids and set the boundaries that will create a <br/>
successful life.<br/>
<br/>
This is what I call &quot;horseshit.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They are deluded.  Here was my son, sharing the most intimate conversations he has with <br/>
me, and we&#39;ve had conversations about much more intimate stuff than this, but he actually <br/>
does trust me.  He thanked me for the way we live our life, and brought up some <br/>
examples from when he was younger about how he didn&#39;t feel he could trust me then, but <br/>
that that&#39;s all gone and he&#39;s so grateful to be able to just talk about anything.  (And, fyi, he <br/>
said I could talk about this as long as everything was very anonymous--&#39;cause he could <br/>
see I was a little fired up!)  I just thought about how sad the whole thing was for their <br/>
family in at least three ways:  <br/>
<br/>
1.  That there is a bigger and bigger gap all the time in his relationship with his parents, <br/>
and they are getting farther and farther away from knowing their son.  <br/>
<br/>
2.  That the boy is completely losing out on his parents as a source of wisdom that he can <br/>
actually access and benefit from.  He&#39;s now going to be in the position that I remember so <br/>
clearly from my own teenagehood of trying to figure it all out for himself, with only the <br/>
help of other teenagers to rely on.  <br/>
<br/>
3.  The rules DON&#39;T WORK.  He, like every intelligent child ever to come before him, will <br/>
find ways around them if he really wants to.  And those ways will involve deception and <br/>
maybe just the hint of danger.  He actually admitted to not even liking the girlfriend all <br/>
that much, but it was fun just to have one, so he was with her anyway.  My son thought <br/>
that was just all wrong and didn&#39;t &quot;get it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The parents don&#39;t/can&#39;t see it, but they are driving their son away from them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-995530283">Vonnegut said something about swearing that resonated with me:<br/>
(roughly) profanity gives people an excuse not to listen to you.<br/>
<br/>
One might not care if the sort of people who would get offended don&#39;t<br/>
listen, but I thought it was a good point.  It can get in the way of<br/>
people listening to what you are really saying.  Not listening will<br/>
also probably translate to misunderstanding your point which I find<br/>
incredibly frustrating.  It is easy to say that it is their problem,<br/>
but if you are trying to communicate effectively with them then it is<br/>
your problem too.  I used to swear a lot more than I do now and that<br/>
had a lot to do with it.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I thought that in &#39;horseshit&#39; was a far better subject than<br/>
&#39;horsedoo&#39; and was much clearer and more effective communication to<br/>
this audience... but if it was used on the original blog it probably<br/>
would get people even more defensive and even less likely to listen to<br/>
the real point (even though it was used there originally).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1335800259">I think I was unclear.  I meant that &quot;horseshit&quot; (&quot;Real horseshit&quot;<br/>
actually) was a better subject of Joanna&#39;s post to this list about her<br/>
son&#39;s friend than horsedoo would have been.   It was a largely a<br/>
better subject because the other woman used it.  I was not talking<br/>
about the blog posting except as Joanna&#39;s response to it.  Perhaps my<br/>
post will make more sense in that light.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, same Vonnegut.  He swears a lot in his books and I imagine he<br/>
knows more than most about not being listened to because of it than<br/>
most people do.  The realization hasn&#39;t, it seems, stopped him from<br/>
swearing in his writing (which I have read most of and enjoyed<br/>
greatly, although it has been a while).  I found the statement very<br/>
interesting and it affected how much I wanted to swear in my life.  I<br/>
still do swear, but there was a conscious effort to tone it down.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that anything I said was in any way contrary to your<br/>
statement that about happy swearing people vs. people being mean with<br/>
accepted words... I don&#39;t disagree with you at all but that is<br/>
separate from the point that I was trying to make.<br/>

I definitely agree with that. I can be a lot like Gordon Ramsay<br/>
sometimes when I&#39;m emotional - and I don&#39;t mean negatively emotional,<br/>
which I seldom am, just emotional rather than intellectual. That<br/>
undoubtedly was instilled in me in my childhood - I grew up in a<br/>
culture where swear words were part of normal conversation. Unless you<br/>
had to be &#39;on your best behaviour&#39; for some reason.<br/>
<br/>
Every time I apologise to my son for my foul language, he says, &quot;I<br/>
keep telling you, I really don&#39;t care&quot; and, interestingly, though he<br/>
often hears it from me and on TV and in some of his videogames, I&#39;ve<br/>
never once heard him use a swear word himself. Not ever.<br/>

show signs of heading down this road at the ages of 12 and 13, and I<br/>
remember being this kid when I was a teenager.  I remember spending a<br/>
lot of energy rebelling against my parents&#39; rules, but puberty was a<br/>
very emotionally difficult time for me (especially when it came to<br/>
boys) and I would even cry sometimes because all I wanted was to be<br/>
able to talk to my mom.  I am trying my best to be that shoulder and<br/>
safe place to go for my niece and nephew, but I worry it won&#39;t be<br/>
enough because I live so far away from them.  My niece seems pretty<br/>
comfortable so far e-mailing me (after school before her parents get<br/>
home) when she needs to talk and I hope that continues, but I don&#39;t<br/>
have that luxury with my nephew and I worry about him a lot.  I feel<br/>
some hope and relief for other children when I read stories on these<br/>
message boards of some parents here who have earned the trust of their<br/>
children&#39;s friends and become that safe place for them.  That&#39;s the<br/>
best I feel I can hope for, that I can be that for other children too.  <br/>

I agree, horseshit is right!<br/>
