<div id="ygrps-yiv-1693315630">For those of you who play World of Warcraft (or WoW), and those who might want to play, my 11 year old daughter and I started a new Alliance guild on the Shandris Realm.  It&#39;s a low populated PvE (normal) server, and we are a low-level guild wanting to level together.  Many of our members have higher level characters on other realms, so there are different experienced players.  We are advertising it as family-oriented, and there will no cursing or suggestive behavior.  Members get one warning only.  Our guild is called Infinitely Confused, courtesy of my daughter Allie.  In game, she is Calari, and I am Gnixi.  If interested, please send me an in-game mail, or you&#39;ll likely find me online since she and I have been playing for a few days now.  We have a good group so far of about 19 members of different ages.<br/>
<br/>
We knew a little about game play, but there is so much to do, and new skills need to be learned to gain higher experience skills.  Allie loves the social aspect of the game.  We are getting to know some of our guild members, and soon will be learning cooperative teamwork techniques to get through quests and raids that require more than 1 or 2 players.  It&#39;s so cool how we bring our different skills together.  Some of us throw magic spells to do damage, some use combat skills to fight up close and take more hit damage, some heal players as their health goes down.  We didn&#39;t realize how much more effective fights can be with different type characters.  It takes concentration and strategy planning for this kind of play.  We also love the professions learned in the game that give us a little taste of what these things might be like outside the game.  Allie worked on her cooking skill all day yesterday and then asked me about making some casseroles this week at home.  My character has an alchemy focus that I find intriguing.  I am thinking of getting a chemistry set for Christmas.  Oh, so far we&#39;re figuring out new things every day without getting bored.  I know it will slow down some, but it&#39;s really great so far.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I talked too much about it.  I was trying not to write a book!  Anyway, we&#39;d love to have more members in our guild.  <br/>
<br/>
There is another guild on a PvP (player vs. player) realm that I&#39;m sure someone here might know about.  It&#39;s a Horde guild.  That&#39;s why we wanted to make an Alliance guild.  But these two guilds are on different servers so they can&#39;t interact anyway.  They are the two opposing factions in the game.  And there are lots and lots of guilds on lots and lots of servers.  Too fun!<br/>

<br/>
Maybe herbalism kits would be as fun, and you could actually create  <br/>
something useful beyond the initial combustion &lt;bwg&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I took Marty drum shopping.  The idea was for him to pick a  <br/>
set of drums we would then get him for Christmas, but he&#39;s the only  <br/>
kid at home this year for Christmas, he&#39;s nearly 21, he&#39;s a little in  <br/>
the dumps for being unemployed, and his girlfriend wants him to drive  <br/>
to Texas before Christmas and then to Las Vegas for his January 14  <br/>
birthday, so he can&#39;t even really pursue a job if he wants that much  <br/>
time off so soon.<br/>
<br/>
So we found a seemingly decent and affordable set, but it was the last  <br/>
one they had.  So I bought it and we bought cases for it, and loaded  <br/>
it into the back of the jeep.  Barely.<br/>
<br/>
The reason we got him drums is that he&#39;s really REALLY good at the  <br/>
drums on rock band.  And unlike the guitar, there is some direct  <br/>
&quot;doing&quot; of the music with those drums.  Marty had once sat at a drum  <br/>
set and actually played, Kirby said.   So last Christmas we had  <br/>
thought of getting him drums, but got him new and better rock band  <br/>
drums instead, and a really nice drum throne.<br/>
<br/>
So Marty put these drums together with the help of an explanatory DVD  <br/>
that came with them, and he tuned the toms and he started to play  <br/>
things.  But rock band has no high hat cymbals, and so he was a little  <br/>
baffled by those.   While he was experimenting, I looked up high hat  <br/>
usage with google, and wikipedia had a lot of detail and suggestions.   <br/>
I would read to him and he would do it.<br/>
<br/>
Five minutes later, he was doing recognizable songs and using the high  <br/>
hat.<br/>
<br/>
As to the organizational skill and responsibility of those larger  <br/>
World of Warcraft raids, this is Kirby&#39;s last tweet.  It&#39;s been days  <br/>
now. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&quot;I&#39;ve been promoted to &quot;raid leader&quot;, for those of you who know what  <br/>
that means... Pray for me.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
!  I forgot to write for your book.<br/>
It is one.  We went to three music stores, and I know guitars and wind  <br/>
instruments and keyboards, not drums.   Still it turned out I knew  <br/>
more terminology than Marty, having been around musicians my whole  <br/>
life, so I figured out the questions to ask.<br/>
<br/>
One thing Marty said was he was afraid Keith would be frustrated if  <br/>
Marty didn&#39;t make good use of the drums, because he thought maybe  <br/>
Keith and I were disappointed with the fact that none of our kids was  <br/>
as musical as we had been.   I told him I had written about that in an  <br/>
article called &quot;Books and Saxophones,&quot; and that we understood that  <br/>
they didn&#39;t need the escape of books or school music classes.<br/>
<br/>
All our kids sing well, and the realities of the need for individuals  <br/>
to make music has changed drastically in the past fifty years, and had  <br/>
changed drastically in the fifty years before that.   Many things are  <br/>
very different.  One reason I was learning to play piano as a kid was  <br/>
the hope that I could become good enough to play at church.  Once when  <br/>
they were desperate, for a small service, I played.  Not very well.   <br/>
But I&#39;ve seen lately that some churches have a screen with the lyrics,  <br/>
and a kind of karaoke setup so that there organ music coming from the  <br/>
computer and the lyrics are visible to the congregation.   Now the  <br/>
kids who can use computers and AV equipment are more useful at some  <br/>
churches than the pianists.  I&#39;ve read about the importance of having  <br/>
organists and organ mainenance people, in the renaissance and baroque  <br/>
eras.  It&#39;s interesting, and bigtime, musically speaking (to have an  <br/>
instrument so big it needs a church to hold it), but I don&#39;t pine for  <br/>
the old days--not ANY old days.  Music survives in any medium.<br/>

This is a huge job and responsibility.  I&#39;ve had two different  <br/>
leaders in the time I&#39;ve been in a serious guild, and it definitely  <br/>
makes a difference in how smoothly and successfully the dungeon or  <br/>
pvp (player vs. player) raid goes.<br/>

I love hearing about Rock Band.  I am thinking it would make a good family gift this year for Christmas.  IF I can find it before Christmas.  I don&#39;t like shopping the day after thanksgiving.  Eek!  <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;d order it from Amazon or somewhere.  Depends whether you have Wii  <br/>
or Xbox 360, and whether you already have some rock band instruments  <br/>
or whether you want to do the best edition with the Beatles drums and  <br/>
the right-looking bass and guitars...<br/>
<br/>
There are photos of a bunch of us playing Beatles Rock Band one night  <br/>
in the continuation/extension day of the Monkey Platter Festival.  We  <br/>
planned three days, but it turned into four and some parts of other  <br/>
days.<br/>
