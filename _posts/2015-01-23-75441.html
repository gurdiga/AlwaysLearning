It&#39;s a really difficult skill, and one I don&#39;t know much about, so there has been a lot of frustration. She has asked me to get the clay centred for her, then when I&#39;m struggling to do so, she started yelling that I&#39;d ruined it. If I tried to suggest that she try something different (bracing her hands against the side for example), she yells that that won&#39;t work. I suggested looking up some tutorials on YouTube. Again she yelled that she&#39;d tried that, and it had made it harder. A little while later, she asked me to look for some tutorials on YouTube. (These suggestions weren&#39;t all at once, but over the course of the day, she&#39;s been playing with the clay on and off all day.)</p><p><br></p><p>She finally managed to get it centred, and make a small pot, and then she wanted to take it off the wheel. After trying to slide the string under it as she&#39;d seen on YouTube, she asked me to do it for her. I slid the string under, but the clay was still too soft, so I suggested we wait until it had dried a little. At first she said it had to be done right away, so I took a deep breath, and showed her how even putting the string under a little was putting pressure on the pot. She decided we should wait until it had dried a little. Then she started spinning the wheel (I think with the intention of the motion helping dry it faster.) </p><p><br></p><p>Because the pot had been moved a little off centre by our attempts to move it, the spinning pushed it out of shape, so I said to stop, and explained what was happening. My daughter got very upset, and began yelling at me that I&#39;d ruined her pot. </p><p><br></p><p>I understand that she&#39;s upset and frustrated by things not working out the way she wants, but I&#39;m finding it really hard to be yelled at for running things frequently, (This has happened on several occasions over the last week, maybe 4 or 5 times?) and I&#39;m not sure how to respond. I&#39;m trying really hard to stay calm and not yell back (not always successfully!), and would love some things I could do instead. </p><p><br></p><p>At the same time, I do feel the need to do something too change this dynamic, as I can see that it&#39;s making me reluctant to do things with her or help her when asked. I&#39;m finding myself pulling back from this sort of activity for fear that it will end up making us both upset, and I really don&#39;t want to do that. (And I&#39;m sure my daughter can sense my reluctance, and it&#39;s making the situation worse.) </p><p><br></p><p>Both of us really enjoy craft (and both have very definite ideas on the best way to do something!) and I want to be able to enjoy this activity, not it be a source of conflict.</p><p><br></p><p><span></span></p><p>Tamara </p><p><span><br class="ygrps-yiv-1724685655ygrps-yiv-1169476194yui-cursor"></span></p></div></div>

Sometimes, he says yes and we do something different for a while. Other times, he REALLY wants to work it out, and doesn&#39;t want to move on. At those times, I try to help, but then if he&#39;s yelling or rude, I will say &quot;Well, I don&#39;t like being yelled at. If you want me to try again, let me know, but right now I don&#39;t think this is helping.&quot; Sometimes I walk away for a minute, so I don&#39;t lose my temper. Then, I will offer a snack, which can help his mood (and his ability to problem solve) and also lets him know I&#39;m not angry.&nbsp; Lots of time we stop for a cocoa and peanut butter cracker break. It&#39;s comforting and cozy.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-252851185"><div dir="ltr">I find for me it helps a lot to change my own mindset about the yelling. I don&#39;t get triggered if I remind myself where their anger is coming from and avoid judging it as rude or disrespectful etc. Knowing that it is just a big feeling that is coming out in my direction and is not about me. I can then really be in a place of empathy with them and offer validation about how frustrating it must be. I can sit with their feelings and be OK with yelling because I no longer feel like the victim of abuse, but a safe place to release stress. <div class="ygrps-yiv-252851185gmail_extra"><br><div class="ygrps-yiv-252851185gmail_quote"><blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-252851185gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;"><div style="background-color:#fff;"><div><div><div style="color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;font-size:14px;"><div style="font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;font-size:14px;"><div style="font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;font-size:16px;"><div><br></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></blockquote></span></blockquote></div></div></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1450465986"><div dir="ltr">I agree, Sandra. When my kids have gotten more extreme, like name calling or hitting, I have asked for more kindness and less name calling or whatever the issue, and have verbalized that I do not want to be hit, etc. There are limits to what I want to accept for myself and I imagine everyone has different limits along those lines. I noticed that the previous commenter had already mentioned some helpful ideas, including verbalizing her request to not be yelled at, leaving the situation, etc. I was trying not to be redundant, but offer a different perspective. Is it your opinion that what Tamara is describing IS abusive? The way I read it, her child seemed to be expressing a lot of frustration through anger and blame. Strategies that don&#39;t seem to be working for Tamara.  I have found that sometimes when I am triggered, it is not as much about what&#39;s happening as my <i>thoughts</i> about what&#39;s happening. When I am able to shift my thoughts about it, I can stay centered and access my higher brain functions as apposed to being in a fight or flight mode. <div><br></div><div>You mentioned that some overflow is acceptable with younger children. Is there an age at which you expect this to shift and no longer be acceptable? If so, what age? When you mentioned that it is possible for a parent to &quot;fail to coach a child&quot;, what is your idea of what that means? Coach them to be socially acceptable? Meaning that if you let your child be abusive toward you, without coaching otherwise, that they will be abusive to others without realizing that there are consequences to that? Just looking for clarity about that concept.

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This has been an ongoing issue for me with one of my sons.  He has explosive anger fits and he seeks me out during these times.  I&#39;m grateful that he seeks me out because I do not get offended or reactive to him and so we can work to help him calm down.  My husband often gets drawn in, feels offended and reactive, which isn&#39;t good for either of them.   As my son gets older, I&#39;ve been able to do more coaching.  It&#39;s been a gradual process, but now when he is verbally mean to me because he&#39;s angry from losing a game, I say that I&#39;m not going to take that to heart.  I&#39;ll wait for you to calm down.  He hears me and is usually able to calm himself within a minute and apologizes for his meanness.  We&#39;ve come a long way.  He used to jump at me and physically attack me.   <br/>
<br/>
Always part of his anger outburst is a demand for food, so I do think blood sugar is part of it.  I&#39;m not sure if some losses are manageable simply because his blood sugar is stable and others are not because of hunger?   Or maybe it&#39;s that a huge disappointing loss uses up a lot of energy and there&#39;s an immediate need for food right away.  Bringing regular snack trays is part of the solution for us.  Me always trusting that he will learn to manage these big frustration outbursts has been really important.  I approach it like a partnership.  I&#39;m the stability during the outburst, and I give him feedback afterwards.  He&#39;s old enough to understand and work on it now.  He&#39;s 11.  We have a book for kids that explains techniques that people can use to manage that big tense feeling before an outburst.  At this point, years into working on his anger, I can even suggest some of the techniques when his anger is rising.  This is because I&#39;m a trustworthy partner.  I&#39;m not reactive and I stay calm when he is getting angry.  He has learned to go away and read a book with a snack.  He can calm himself down a good deal of the time.  It&#39;s pretty amazing!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-195957068">Lori Odhner&#39;s &quot;Marriage Moats&quot; today might have ideas for some situations about yelling.<br/>
________________<br/>

<br/>
Pencil in My Teeth<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A mother with a pack of little kids told me her latest trick. She puts a pencil between her teeth at the most vulnerable time of day.... trying to get out the door.<br/>
<br/>
She heard it on a TED talk about changing your body stance to reflect where you want to be. The speaker, who is a professor in an MBA program, says that taking a pose like spreading your arms can help you feel more powerful. She also mentioned that the presence of an object in your mouth forces you to smile, making it hard to get angry. Not only that it keeps said little kids curious enough to get their boots on. <br/>
<br/>
Another mom told me she was starting to lose it with her daughter while she was brushing another daughter&#39;s hair. She poured her focus into the soft brown locks, and it kept the anger at a distance. <br/>
<br/>
There was a time in Odhner history when I knew I had to be at the local library at four o&#39;clock. Every day. The librarian probably thought I was an over achieving mother of preschoolers, exposing them to books often and eagerly. But it was a survival tactic. If we were home in the late afternoon, bedlam would erupt. If we were in a public place, we held it together. Then by five I could trundle them home in my bike cart and drop the kids in a pile of Legos while I rustled up supper. <br/>
<br/>
I applaud such proactive measures. We are generally smart enough to put on coats when it is twenty degrees outside. There are ways to protect us from unfriendly interactions as well. <br/>
<br/>
One time John and I were just beginning to clash about something that is no longer of any consequence, and he tossed me an appreciation. It was like a pencil between my teeth. I had to smile. Another time we were arguing when he noticed our son, who was supposed to be vacuuming the floor, was sucking up Cheerios one by one. And laughing. Our angst flew out the window. <br/>
<br/>
I love that the content of the disagreements have long ago expired, but the peacemaking attempts are still fresh in my memory. <br/>
Love, <br/>
<br/>
Lori<br/>

<br/>
This seems very wimpy to me, honestly.  <br/>
<br/>
If your neighbor or a stranger came into your house and hit you or one of your children, would you have verbalized that you do not want to be hit, etc.?<br/>
<br/>
-=-There are limits to what I want to accept for myself -=-<br/>
<br/>
How about &quot;There are limits to what I will accept.&quot;  <br/>
Are you planning to accept things you don&#39;t want to accept?<br/>
<br/>
If a child is hitting another child, say STOP.  Not kind of or maybe or kind of.  <br/>
If a child is hitting you, why would you not stop it immediately and absolutely?  <br/>
<br/>
-=- Is it your opinion that what Tamara is describing IS abusive? -=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know from that much description, but I think it involves awareness and intent.  And if a mother takes a victim role, that won&#39;t help anyone.  And if the mother denies being victimized and justifies bullying behavior in a child, how is she helping him learn to live more peacefully in the world?<br/>
<br/>
-=-You mentioned that some overflow is acceptable with younger children. Is there an age at which you expect this to shift and no longer be acceptable? If so, what age?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Children learn to read somewhere between two and 14, generally.<br/>
Children learn to walk between ten months and two years, pretty much.<br/>
Why do you think I would know or think or name an age at which emotional maturity should kick in?<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/intelligences">http://sandradodd.com/intelligences</a><br/>
Some people have a great deal of intrapersonal intelligence.  They know themselves early on.<br/>
Some have lots in interpersonal intelligence and are good at reading others and negotiating with them.  <br/>
Some people take longer to figure things out.<br/>
<br/>
Some people might be great with interpersonal relations, but have a quick temper, or hormone storms, and so have certain times that it&#39;s more difficult.  Some people might have a hard time being nice if they&#39;re sick, or hungry. <br/>
<br/>
Parents should partner with children in helping them be aware of whatever factors are at play in various situation—having guests, visiting, getting sleep, drinking water, eating, learning ways to calm themselves.  These things are different for different people, and part of the learning people ideally do with unschooling is learning how to manager their own moods and needs.<br/>
<br/>
-=-When you mentioned that it is possible for a parent to &quot;fail to coach a child&quot;, what is your idea of what that means? Coach them to be socially acceptable?-=-<br/>
<br/>
YES! <br/>
That can&#39;t be surprising, can it?  <br/>
<br/>
-=- Meaning that if you let your child be abusive toward you, without coaching otherwise, that they will be abusive to others without realizing that there are consequences to that?-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s possible.  <br/>
It has happened.<br/>
Some parents tell their children that their behavior is okay because they are gifted, or Aspergers, or understandably frustrated, or were mistreated in some former family or situation, or whatever justifications.  Instead of helping a child be at peace in the world, some parents hlpe the world will accommodate the child&#39;s actions, instead of helping him out.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Meaning that if you let your child be abusive toward you, without coaching otherwise, that they will be abusive to others without realizing that there are consequences to that?-=-<br/>
<br/>
If a child is left to discover that there are consequences to being abusive, how long might that take?  There are things that children might do without legal consequences that will be illegal in a teen or adult, and could result in jailtime or prison.   That&#39;s an extreme example, but these are extremely basic questions.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I am also curious to know what your ideas are about when yelling becomes abusive.  Frequency? Volume? Content/context? -=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m curious about the question.  It seems legalistic.  It seems if I answer, you might want to use it to justify some action of your own.<br/>
If the mother feels abused, she should ask that child to stop, or remove herself from the situation, or get help.<br/>
If the mother decides to find ways not to feel abused, in such a fashion that the child might escalate his behavior to get her attention, why would she do that?<br/>
<br/>
Intent would be a factor, certainly.  Awareness and expectation could matter.<br/>
-=-Frequency? Volume? Content/context? -=-<br/>
<br/>
That can&#39;t be answered any more than &quot;at what age does it stop being acceptable?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I suppose if the mother has no interest in or ability to coach the child, she might want to hire a coach or counsellor.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/issues/therapy">http://sandradodd.com/issues/therapy</a><br/>

My suggestion is not to deny abuse but to reframe what might not be abuse but big emotions that need help being understood and expressed without judgement or shaming.

You said, &quot;</span><span style="font-size:13px;">Sometimes yelling IS abusive&quot;. When?

It presumes that there is a result before there is a decision. The word <i>might</i> is key here I think. In which case, I think the answer is because she would not know until she tried. Is this in reference to my comment about what works for me? I would think <i>if </i>things escalated, she might find a different solution. My kids respond well to empathy. If anything, it tends to deescalate matters. Then we can have a calm conversation about what works and what doesn&#39;t and other more desirable options for expressing frustration. IE: It would work better if the child yelled out, but not <i>at</i>.  I think that might fall under &quot;coaching&quot; but I just see it as parenting and automatically part of every process involving raising kids. Perhaps that was the key to my lack of complete details.  </div><div><br></div><div>The idea of changing one&#39;s mindset about a situation can be helpful in staying centered and therefore more capable of having calm conversations and giving advice to your child about options and more socially appropriate responses to feelings. If you are triggered personally, it&#39;s difficult to reason and find a peaceful resolution. </div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-size:13px;">~Parents should partner with children in helping them be aware of whatever factors are at play in various situation—having guests, visiting, getting sleep, drinking water, eating, learning ways to calm themselves.

<div>
  <div>


    <div>
      
      
      <p>-=- When my kids have gotten more extreme, like name calling or hitting, I have asked for more kindness and less name calling or whatever the issue, and have verbalized that I do not want to be hit, etc. There are limits to what I want to accept for myself and I imagine everyone has different limits along those lines. -=-<br>
<br>
This seems very wimpy to me, honestly.  <br>
<br>
If your neighbor or a stranger came into your house and hit you or one of your children, would you have verbalized that you do not want to be hit, etc.?<br>
<br>
-=-There are limits to what I want to accept for myself -=-<br>
<br>
How about &quot;There are limits to what I will accept.&quot;  <br>
Are you planning to accept things you don&#39;t want to accept?<br>
<br>
If a child is hitting another child, say STOP.  Not kind of or maybe or kind of.  <br>
If a child is hitting you, why would you not stop it immediately and absolutely?  <br>
<br>
-=- Is it your opinion that what Tamara is describing IS abusive? -=-<br>
<br>
I don&#39;t know from that much description, but I think it involves awareness and intent.  And if a mother takes a victim role, that won&#39;t help anyone.  And if the mother denies being victimized and justifies bullying behavior in a child, how is she helping him learn to live more peacefully in the world?<br>
<br>
-=-You mentioned that some overflow is acceptable with younger children. Is there an age at which you expect this to shift and no longer be acceptable? If so, what age?-=-<br>
<br>
Children learn to read somewhere between two and 14, generally.<br>
Children learn to walk between ten months and two years, pretty much.<br>
Why do you think I would know or think or name an age at which emotional maturity should kick in?<br>
<br>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/intelligences">http://sandradodd.com/intelligences</a><br>
Some people have a great deal of intrapersonal intelligence.  They know themselves early on.<br>
Some have lots in interpersonal intelligence and are good at reading others and negotiating with them.  <br>
Some people take longer to figure things out.<br>
<br>
Some people might be great with interpersonal relations, but have a quick temper, or hormone storms, and so have certain times that it&#39;s more difficult.  Some people might have a hard time being nice if they&#39;re sick, or hungry. <br>
<br>
Parents should partner with children in helping them be aware of whatever factors are at play in various situation—having guests, visiting, getting sleep, drinking water, eating, learning ways to calm themselves.  These things are different for different people, and part of the learning people ideally do with unschooling is learning how to manager their own moods and needs.<br>
<br>
-=-When you mentioned that it is possible for a parent to &quot;fail to coach a child&quot;, what is your idea of what that means? Coach them to be socially acceptable?-=-<br>
<br>
YES! <br>
That can&#39;t be surprising, can it?  <br>
<br>
-=- Meaning that if you let your child be abusive toward you, without coaching otherwise, that they will be abusive to others without realizing that there are consequences to that?-=-<br>
<br>
It&#39;s possible.  <br>
It has happened.<br>
Some parents tell their children that their behavior is okay because they are gifted, or Aspergers, or understandably frustrated, or were mistreated in some former family or situation, or whatever justifications.  Instead of helping a child be at peace in the world, some parents hlpe the world will accommodate the child&#39;s actions, instead of helping him out.<br>
<br>
-=- Meaning that if you let your child be abusive toward you, without coaching otherwise, that they will be abusive to others without realizing that there are consequences to that?-=-<br>
<br>
If a child is left to discover that there are consequences to being abusive, how long might that take?  There are things that children might do without legal consequences that will be illegal in a teen or adult, and could result in jailtime or prison.   That&#39;s an extreme example, but these are extremely basic questions.<br>
<br>
-=-I am also curious to know what your ideas are about when yelling becomes abusive.  Frequency? Volume? Content/context? -=-<br>
<br>
I&#39;m curious about the question.  It seems legalistic.  It seems if I answer, you might want to use it to justify some action of your own.<br>
If the mother feels abused, she should ask that child to stop, or remove herself from the situation, or get help.<br>
If the mother decides to find ways not to feel abused, in such a fashion that the child might escalate his behavior to get her attention, why would she do that?<br>
<br>
Intent would be a factor, certainly.  Awareness and expectation could matter.<br>
-=-Frequency? Volume? Content/context? -=-<br>
<br>
That can&#39;t be answered any more than &quot;at what age does it stop being acceptable?&quot;<br>
<br>
I suppose if the mother has no interest in or ability to coach the child, she might want to hire a coach or counsellor.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/issues/therapy">http://sandradodd.com/issues/therapy</a><br>

When he gets frustrated at a game that he is trying to play for example, I offer help and take deep breaths and remind him to take deep breaths too.&nbsp;</span></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1492353165yiv8438005545yui_3_16_0_1_1422104105475_12167"><span class="ygrps-yiv-1492353165yiv8438005545" style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;font-size:13px;line-height:16.25px;"><br></span></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1492353165yiv8438005545yui_3_16_0_1_1422104105475_12167" dir="ltr"><span class="ygrps-yiv-1492353165yiv8438005545" id="ygrps-yiv-1492353165yiv8438005545yui_3_16_0_1_1422313327439_12007" style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;font-size:13px;line-height:16.25px;">I&#39;ve found that it helps him if I speak softer rather than louder most of the time and I try to remember to do that. Depending on my sense of his emotions and what caused the frustration or sense of feeling overwhelmed, I may hold him or hug him while speaking (or not speak), or bend down a bit and look directly in his eyes while we talk or move to a new environment. I figure out which to do by feel and by knowing him and by what has helped in the past.

(When I&#39;m feeling accused, it can be hard to not sound perturbed or resentful. But I try.) I also remind him that I am helping him and don&#39;t have to do so. I don&#39;t want to be yelled at and it&#39;s not nice to yell at someone, especially if they are trying to help.&nbsp;</span></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1492353165yiv8438005545yui_3_16_0_1_1422104105475_12167" dir="ltr"><span class="ygrps-yiv-1492353165yiv8438005545" style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;font-size:13px;line-height:16.25px;"><br></span></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1492353165yiv8438005545yui_3_16_0_1_1422104105475_12167" dir="ltr"><font face="Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto" id="ygrps-yiv-1492353165yiv8438005545yui_3_16_0_1_1422387165204_83226"><span id="ygrps-yiv-1492353165yiv8438005545yui_3_16_0_1_1422387165204_83225" style="font-size:13px;line-height:16.25px;">That is how I try to respond to my 6 year old.

Maybe that is the best she can do for right now. Perhaps she is yelling because that is all she can think to do when she gets so frustrated. Give her other ideas.

Maybe your daughter would appreciate a heartfelt note? &nbsp;Not to address any particular situation, but to open up another avenue of communication. &nbsp;It&#39;s kind of nice (in my opinion) to write a note to someone I care about or to read one that they left.

I tend to be more serious and my kids remind me that it&#39;s okay and so much more fun to be goofy and silly. Maybe finding a comedy to watch together (or anything she would be into) or to go out to see an entertainer of some sort would be amusing and help to create a lighter mood or open yourself up to being a little sillier. Keep seeking enjoyment.&nbsp;</span></font></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1492353165yiv8438005545yui_3_16_0_1_1422104105475_12167" dir="ltr"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1492353165yiv8438005545yui_3_16_0_1_1422104105475_12167"><span class="ygrps-yiv-1492353165yiv8438005545" id="ygrps-yiv-1492353165yiv8438005545yui_3_16_0_1_1422387165204_83618" style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;font-size:13px;line-height:16.25px;">Try to view your role as helper when your daughter is having a hard moment because that is one of the times when our kids need us most. That doesn&#39;t mean to be okay with it if she is being mean toward you. (My grandma used to say, &quot;Knock it off&quot; when she wanted someone to stop doing or saying something.) But those kind of times can be opportunities to talk to her about what is acceptable and what isn&#39;t in society and what is hurtful and what can be said in a different way. Not in the heat of a moment, but when the time is right.</span><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1492353165yiv8438005545yui_3_16_0_1_1422104105475_12167"><span class="ygrps-yiv-1492353165yiv8438005545" style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;font-size:13px;line-height:16.25px;"><br></span></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1492353165yiv8438005545yui_3_16_0_1_1422104105475_12167" dir="ltr"><span class="ygrps-yiv-1492353165yiv8438005545" style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;font-size:13px;line-height:16.25px;">Laurie&nbsp;</span></div></div></div>

~If your neighbor or a stranger came into your house and hit you or one of your children, would you have verbalized that you do not want to be hit, etc.?~<br/>
<br/>
My child is not a stranger. They are young beings who need understanding and help managing big feelings. <br/>
<br/>
~How about &quot;There are limits to what I will accept.~<br/>
Another Mom might have different limits for herself and her child. I don&#39;t decide what her limits are, just mine. Is that more clear? -=-<br/>
<br/>
No. <br/>
I was talking about the language you&#39;re using to write to us.  it&#39;s once or twice removed from saying something direct and strong.<br/>
<br/>
I verbalized that I did not want you to be so wimpy, but you started talking about children and limits.<br/>
I was talking about your writing &quot;I verbalized that I do not want to be hit.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Say &quot;Don&#39;t hit me.&quot;<br/>
Do you speak to your child in phrases like &quot;I verbalized&quot;?  If so, that might be adding to frustration.<br/>
<br/>
From the post to which I was responding:  &quot;I have asked for more kindness and less name calling or whatever the issue, and have verbalized that I do not want to be hit, etc.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You just asked?  For LESS name calling?  Some was still okay, but it was up to him to decide?  And you don&#39;t want to be hit, but it&#39;s still up to him?<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why I asked if you would speak to a neighbor or another adult that way.  It&#39;s not strong.  It&#39;s not defending your right to be safe and unattacked in your own home.  It&#39;s not making it clear to the child that it&#39;s NOT okay to hit other people that way.  (In self defense, maybe; to defend another person in an emergency, sure.)<br/>
<br/>
-=-I don&#39;t recall suggesting victimhood or denial. -=-<br/>
<br/>
When I write here—when any of the longtime writers write—it&#39;s for the benefit of anyone reading.  We&#39;re talking about the ideas brought to the table.  There is a victim, when there is abuse.  We were talking about abuse (and you were trying to backpedal and say it wasn&#39;t; that was what made me think of denial). <br/>
<br/>
And this, too, is two steps from solid:  -=-I don&#39;t recall suggesting victimhood or denial. -=-<br/>
You don&#39;t need to &quot;recall&quot;—it&#39;s a written conversation.  <br/>
You could have written &quot;I didn&#39;t say &quot;victimhood&quot; or &quot;denial.&quot; <br/>
Instead of<br/>
I don&#39;t recall<br/>
suggesting<br/>
victimhood or denial.<br/>
<br/>
IF (just if) your regular mode of communication is to coat words in words and then have introductory phrases, that will very likely cause children not to understand you, first of all; not to take you seriously; and eventually not to listen to you.<br/>
<br/>
Think of what you want to communicate and do it in three or five words.  With feeling.  Be the lead partner in your relationship.  Take care of your children.  Be solid.  <br/>
That&#39;s for anyone, and everyone, who tends to fall into &quot;Well, sweetie, I understand that you might be feeling frustrated, but your sister doesn&#39;t want to be hit and when you yell it hurts mommy&#39;s ears, so please find a way to be more peaceful&quot; instead of &quot;HEY.  Stop.  Leave her alone.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>

My son has Asperger&#39;s. It is a lifelong disability. He is in fact not abusive to anyone, the only person he ever hurts is himself, but he reacts with lots of emotion at times when he feels overwhelmed. He has no choice about this. Asperger&#39;s is <strong>the reason</strong> he behaves as he does, not the justification.&nbsp;He is learning with time (he is 12 now)&nbsp;how to better manage himself and has learnt to calm himself down to an extent, and gaining more and more insight into his own and other people&#39;s feelings and behaviour; we talk a lot and I help him in many ways every single day and life&nbsp;can be hard for him and us all. &nbsp;If a child has a physical disability no one would suggest that&nbsp; a parent&nbsp;is justifying their child&#39;s limitation(s) because&nbsp;he or she&nbsp;has a disability.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1285318799">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that Sandra stated that Asperger&#39;s does not exist or cannot be the root of certain behavior.  She wrote, &quot;Some parents tell their children that their behavior is okay... instead of helping him out.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It seems from your post that you are working with your son on his behavior, so I see no dischord between your experience and Sandra&#39;s statement.  <br/>
<br/>
To say, &quot;...no one would suggest that a parent is justifying their child&#39;s limitation(s) because he or she has a disability...&quot; is short-sighted.  I imagine that some folks use disabilities as an excuse to ignore opportunities for coaching because they don&#39;t want to put the time in. It is easier for some to blame the disability.  There are lots of lazy parents out there, and some have kids with disabilities.  No one said that you are one of them.  <br/>
<br/>
Respectfully,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-422088736">-=-Some parents tell their children that their behavior is okay because they<br/>
 are gifted, or Aspergers, or understandably frustrated, or were mistreated<br/>
 in some former family or situation, or whatever justifications. Instead of<br/>
 helping a child be at peace in the world, some parents hope the world will<br/>
 accommodate the child&#39;s actions, instead of helping him out-=-<br/>
<br/>
I had a typo; sorry:  &quot;some parents hlpe the world will&quot; should have been &quot;hope.&quot; <br/>
And the last &quot;helping him out&quot; referred to parents, not to the world.  It could have been worded more carefully.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Every time I read something like this I feel angry. My son has Asperger&#39;s. It is a lifelong disability. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry your son has Asperger&#39;s.  If you&#39;re telling him that bad behavior is okay, and you&#39;re not helping him at all, then I think that&#39;s a problem.<br/>
<br/>
-=-He is in fact not abusive to anyone,-=-<br/>
<br/>
Then did the original statement apply in your case?<br/>
<br/>
-=- ... he reacts with lots of emotion at times when he feels overwhelmed. <br/>
He has no choice about this. Asperger&#39;s is the reason he behaves as he does, not the justification.-=-<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;justification&quot; was not about the child, but about parental attitude, behavior, action.  IF a parent is NOT helping a child to be at peace in the world, and IF a parent is not helping the child out, THEN I think they&#39;re using the condition or label or disability or unfortunate circumstance as a justification for not coaching the child to do better.<br/>
<br/>
-=-He is learning with time (he is 12 now) how to better manage himself and has learnt to calm himself down to an extent, and gaining more and more insight into his own and other people&#39;s feelings and behaviour; we talk a lot and I help him in many ways every single day and life can be hard for him and us all.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
So you expressed anger even though my statement didn&#39;t apply to you?<br/>
<br/>
-=-If a child has a physical disability no one would suggest that  a parent is justifying their child&#39;s limitation(s) because he or she has a disability. It is exactly the same with Asperger&#39;s. -=-<br/>
<br/>
If a parent whose child has a disability chooses to homeschool and the parent does not help the child compensate for and live well with that limitation, then perhaps the child would be better off in school with professionals.   If a parent does not have the desire or the will or the ability to help a child, homeschooling might not be a good idea.   <br/>
<br/>
When a child for ANY reason is yelling or hitting people in the family, the way the parent responds in the moment, and over time, could make the difference between a future marriage and career, or frustration, running away, prison.   This is true with or without government actions.   <br/>
<br/>
Stating that Asperger&#39;s is &quot;a lifelong disability&quot; and &quot;rightly so&quot; might cause some people to relax and decide that their child has no choice, and can&#39;t learn to be better—that age and experience won&#39;t help, because it&#39;s lifelong, and it&#39;s a disability, and so the parent might not bother to coach and advise and assist so much.<br/>
<br/>
Some parents take that stance because of divorce, or genetics, or religious rejection of a trait in a child, or because they want to be the mother of a gifted child or an indigo child, and so they stand by and smile, or stand by and scowl, because they don&#39;t want to or they don&#39;t know how to or they are unwilling to guide a child, as a partner, into acceptable, helpful, generous interpersonal paths.<br/>
<br/>
People can be as mad or self-justifying or as political or as religious as they want to be, and reject or enable their children&#39;s behavior as they want to.  Meanwhile, what I intend to continue to do for people who want to be unschoolers in the way it&#39;s discussed here, is to encourage them to be each child&#39;s partner, to help him live peacefully and joyfully, and to learn in his own way as happily and as richly as they can arrange for it to happen.   <br/>
<br/>
Your child is twelve.  I&#39;ve been helping other people see and understand unschooling for nearly twenty four years now.  Some in person (local weekly meet-ups, when my kids were young), some who came to visit or to a conference, and many online have had children they or professionals had identified as Asperger&#39;s.  Some were helped more by the parents than others.  <br/>
<br/>
If I had never seen a parent justify bad behavior and say &quot;oh well, it can&#39;t be helped&quot; when the child could have been helped, or others could have been less affected, I wouldn&#39;t even have the idea in my mind.  I&#39;ve seen a range of great, good, not great relationships, and I&#39;ve seen how they affect the unschooling environment in the family and the peace and development of the individuals and their siblings.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen hands-off, hands-up parents use various justifications for not helping a child do better.  I&#39;ve seen them blame other things, other people.  I don&#39;t like to see it recommended in discussions I&#39;ve organized and invited people to.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1048351917">&lt;&lt;Sometimes a team leader or senior partner needs to say &quot;NO. Stop.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I am one of those parents whose child gets easily overwhelmed and assaults other people sometimes. It can be completely unpredictable - sitting next to someone on a train once, an unknown child over the other side of the playground another time. We have largely stopped going out and very rarely to crowded places as they clearly make him very stressed and anxious. We also rarely have visitors to the house for the same reason.  I am also one of those parents who says things like &#39;you are really stressed and overwhelmed &#39; to my son, whilst I prevent him from hitting someone. The reason I do this is not because I am justifying his behaviour but because I have found that when I say &#39;NO, stop&#39; firmly he becomes more agitated, more violent and harder to contain.  At home we spend a lot of time helping him manage his emotions and behaviour, but he still gets overwhelmed and is unpredictable. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes parents do not say &#39;No, stop&#39; for good reasons, not because they are justifying or excusing behaviour.  I absolutely do not think my son should assaulting people, but I also know that saying No firmly does not stop him from doing so, and can make things worse.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1594495723">-=- I am also one of those parents who says things like &#39;you are really stressed and overwhelmed &#39; to my son, whilst I prevent him from hitting someone. -=-<br/>
<br/>
You didn&#39;t say how old he is.  <br/>
If he&#39;s old enough to understand &quot;stressed and overwhelmed,&quot; maybe that&#39;s still too many words to use.  And it does attempt to justify.  It says that it&#39;s happening because he is stressed and overwhelmed.  <br/>
<br/>
But the original question, I think, is a child hitting and yelling at his own mom at home.   If she just lets it go by without suggesting alternatives (which I&#39;m not saying you do, which I am saying at least one poster has indicated that she does sometimes), It doesn&#39;t seem to me to be a good unschooling-partnership example to encourage in a discussion such as this one.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry for parents whose children are physical that way, and many will outgrow it as they learn more about themselves.  There are many children without any condition or disability whatsoever who have frustrating stages because their understanding has moved ahead of their physical abilities, or vice versa, and growing up is often that way, back and forth, for a while.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-86602126">-=- Or she will shout that she will yell as much as she wants to.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I would say &quot;Then you need to do it in your own room, because I want this room to be more peaceful,&quot; or &quot;When you&#39;re grown and have your own house, then you can yell as much as you want.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And depending what time it is and how near your neighbors are, it might be somewhere between rude and illegal.<br/>
<br/>
You  might ask her who told her she can yell as much as she wants to. <br/>
<br/>
Some unschoolers make the gigantic mistake of telling their children &quot;You can do whatever you want to&quot; (when they move from school to homeschooling, or homeschooling to unschooling). Some say &#39;it&#39;s just as much your house as ours.&quot;  It&#39;s not true, and it&#39;s not good.<br/>
<br/>
If that&#39;s not the case here, you don&#39;t need to be defensive.  There ARE people who have done that, and some who haven&#39;t who might like to have a reminder NOT to.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-115321475"><div dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:13px;">~ verbalized that I did not want you to be so wimpy, but you started talking about children and limits.</span><br style="font-size:13px;"><span style="font-size:13px;">I was talking about your writing &quot;I verbalized that I do not want to be hit.&quot;~</span><br style="font-size:13px;"><div><span style="font-size:13px;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size:13px;">~Say &quot;Don&#39;t hit me.&quot;</span><br style="font-size:13px;"><span style="font-size:13px;">Do you speak to your child in phrases like &quot;I verbalized&quot;? If so, that might be adding to frustration.~</span></div><div><span style="font-size:13px;"><br></span></div><div>No, I did not say that was what I said to <i>him</i>. I used those words to describe what I did. I did not quote myself intentionally because there are many different ways in which I might go about verbalizing what I want. I was trying to be brief. It was a brief sentence to get the point across that I use my voice/words to communicate to my child about not being hit. An actual example might be &quot;Stop, I do not want to be hit&quot; or &quot;Do not hit me&quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t want you to hit me&quot; all of those are examples of how I might &quot;verbalize&quot; to him that I do not want to be hit. There are times when I have started by validating his feelings and then told him to stop or redirected him. &quot;I can see you&#39;re really angry and I don&#39;t want to be hit&quot;, &quot;Wow, you&#39;re really angry, hit the pillow instead&quot;. All of these have worked to stop or redirect him to an appropriate target. </div><div><span style="font-size:13px;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size:13px;">~You just asked? For LESS name calling? Some was still okay, but it was up to him to decide? And you don&#39;t want to be hit, but it&#39;s still up to him?~</span><span style="font-size:13px;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size:13px;"><br></span></div><div>No. I am not asking in the form of a question. I am asking in the form of a request. That does not mean to me that I am expecting a reply and/or that I am giving him the option. In the same way that I described that I &quot;verbalized&quot;, I used the word &quot;asked&quot; as I descriptor to mean that a request was made. If I said &quot;Please stop hitting me&quot;, I could describe that as having asked him to stop hitting me. He was asked to stop hitting. </div><div><br></div><div>In regards to using the word &quot;less&quot;, I mean that in terms of over-all. I want less hitting and name calling over-all, So, over all, I&#39;m asking for (read requesting) more of what I want and less of what I don&#39;t want. I also don&#39;t see it as an absolute, No hitting or name calling again, ever. That seems unrealistic and dominant paradigm. But when I speak <i>to</i> my children I don&#39;t say &quot;I want <i>less</i> hitting.&quot; </div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-size:13px;">~When I write here—when any of the longtime writers write—it&#39;s for the benefit of anyone reading. We&#39;re talking about the ideas brought to the table. There is a victim, when there is abuse. We were talking about abuse (and you were trying to backpedal and say it wasn&#39;t; that was what made me think of denial).~ </span><br></div><div><span style="font-size:13px;"><br></span></div><div>I was not &quot;backpedaling&quot;, I honestly did not see it as abuse (based on the description) and she did not call it abuse. The way I read it, her daughter was getting very frustrated and yelling at her Mom and blaming her for things going wrong or being ruined. Tamara was finding it difficult to stay calm and respond without yelling back. She wanted some suggestions of some things she could do instead. She also wanted to change the dynamic because she saw a pattern repeating and wanted to stop the cycle. That was how I perceived what I read. <i>I</i> used the word abuse because sometimes being in a stressful situation with lots of emotions, being yelled at can feel like abuse (especially if you&#39;re in that mindset) when it might really be a very frustrated child that could use some empathy and understanding and later, coaching. I also don&#39;t want to negate the possibility that <i>she</i> feels that it <i>is</i> abusive. That is up to her to decide. I just didn&#39;t see it that way.  </div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-size:13px;">~And this, too, is two steps from solid: -=-I don&#39;t recall suggesting victimhood or denial. -=-</span><br style="font-size:13px;"><span style="font-size:13px;">You don&#39;t need to &quot;recall&quot;—it&#39;s a written conversation.  </span><br style="font-size:13px;"><span style="font-size:13px;">You could have written &quot;I didn&#39;t say &quot;victimhood&quot; or &quot;denial.&quot; </span><br style="font-size:13px;"><span style="font-size:13px;">Instead of</span><span class="ygrps-yiv-115321475im" style="font-size:13px;"><br>I don&#39;t recall<br>suggesting<br>victimhood or denial.~</span><br></div><div><br></div><div><font color="#000000">It would not make sense to write &quot;I didn&#39;t say &quot;victimhood&quot; or &quot;denial&quot;. When nobody said that I had written those words. It was implied that I had suggested those things, not that I had typed those words.  I did not write words that said I was suggesting victimhood or denial but something I wrote could have given you the impression that I was suggesting it. So maybe I could have used the word &quot;think&quot;. &quot;I did not <i>think</i> I suggested...&quot; or I did not <i>intend</i> to suggest. I think it was still clear what I was communicating. You call it not being solid. I call it leaving room for having a different opinion. </font></div><div><font color="#000000"><br></font></div><div><div style="font-size:13px;">~I don&#39;t know from that much description, but I think it involves awareness and intent. And if a mother takes a victim role, that won&#39;t help anyone. And if the mother denies being victimized and justifies bullying behavior in a child, how is she helping him learn to live more peacefully in the world?~<br></div></div><div style="font-size:13px;"><br></div><div style="font-size:13px;">I did not suggest that anyone take a victim role or deny bullying and justify the behavior. But it seems as thought you might have read into what I wrote as having suggested that. Or maybe this was totally unrelated to what I wrote and you were just bringing it up as a hypothetical. </div><div style="font-size:13px;"><br></div><div style="font-size:13px;">~That&#39;s for anyone, and everyone, who tends to fall into &quot;Well, sweetie, I understand that you might be feeling frustrated, but your sister doesn&#39;t want to be hit and when you yell it hurts mommy&#39;s ears, so please find a way to be more peaceful&quot; instead of &quot;HEY. Stop. Leave her alone.&quot; ~<br></div><div style="font-size:13px;"><br></div><div style="font-size:13px;">Sometimes I use one version, sometimes the other. It depends on the situation. They are equally valid responses depending on the moment and the child. I don&#39;t think anyone who wants to take a more peaceful approach is wrong for doing so and it is still possible to be &quot;solid&quot; AND reassure your child that you have some understanding and empathy for their feelings. Saying &quot;Well, sweetie, I understand that you might be feeling frustrated, but your sister doesn&#39;t want to be hit and when you yell it hurts mommy&#39;s ears, so please find a way to be more peaceful&quot; does not justify anyone&#39;s actions, or deny bullying behavior. It recognizes that we all get disregulated sometimes and need help getting back to center without shaming a child for having feelings they weren&#39;t able to manage in that moment. (which can often make matters worse) It&#39;s not calling it right that they hit either. </div><div style="font-size:13px;"><br></div><div style="font-size:13px;">~But the original question, I think, is a child hitting and yelling at his own mom at home. If she just lets it go by without suggesting alternatives (which I&#39;m not saying you do, which I am saying at least one poster has indicated that she does sometimes), It doesn&#39;t seem to me to be a good unschooling-partnership example to encourage in a discussion such as this one.~<br></div><div style="font-size:13px;"><br></div><div style="font-size:13px;">IF you are referring to me being the &quot;one poster&quot;. I did not indicate that I did not suggest alternatives. Other people were already making suggestions of that nature. I was simply offering a different perspective on the mindset she could choose during the yelling that might help her stay focused and calm (and not get triggered and yell back) so that she could actually attempt to put into action whatever method she then chose to implement to remedy the situation. I was trying to offer something that might be a helpful piece of the puzzle. Not a total solution, but something that might aide in the implementing of her chosen solution.  </div><div style="font-size:13px;"><br></div><div style="font-size:13px;">Mindset can make a huge difference in staying calm instead of reactionary. I find it helps me. That&#39;s all. </div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>J;D</div></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-115321475gmail_extra"><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> <div class="ygrps-yiv-115321475gmail_quote">On Tue, Jan 27, 2015 at 6:39 PM, Sandra Dodd Sandra@...

~If your neighbor or a stranger came into your house and hit you or one of your children, would you have verbalized that you do not want to be hit, etc.?~<br>
<br>
My child is not a stranger. They are young beings who need understanding and help managing big feelings. <br>
<br>
~How about &quot;There are limits to what I will accept.~<br></span>
Another Mom might have different limits for herself and her child. I don&#39;t decide what her limits are, just mine. Is that more clear? -=-<br>
<br>
No. <br>
I was talking about the language you&#39;re using to write to us.  it&#39;s once or twice removed from saying something direct and strong.<br>
<br>
I verbalized that I did not want you to be so wimpy, but you started talking about children and limits.<br>
I was talking about your writing &quot;I verbalized that I do not want to be hit.&quot;<br>
<br>
Say &quot;Don&#39;t hit me.&quot;<br>
Do you speak to your child in phrases like &quot;I verbalized&quot;?  If so, that might be adding to frustration.<br>
<br>
From the post to which I was responding:  &quot;I have asked for more kindness and less name calling or whatever the issue, and have verbalized that I do not want to be hit, etc.&quot;<br>
<br>
You just asked?  For LESS name calling?  Some was still okay, but it was up to him to decide?  And you don&#39;t want to be hit, but it&#39;s still up to him?<br>
<br>
That&#39;s why I asked if you would speak to a neighbor or another adult that way.  It&#39;s not strong.  It&#39;s not defending your right to be safe and unattacked in your own home.  It&#39;s not making it clear to the child that it&#39;s NOT okay to hit other people that way.  (In self defense, maybe; to defend another person in an emergency, sure.)<br>
<br>
-=-I don&#39;t recall suggesting victimhood or denial. -=-<br>
<br>
When I write here—when any of the longtime writers write—it&#39;s for the benefit of anyone reading.  We&#39;re talking about the ideas brought to the table.  There is a victim, when there is abuse.  We were talking about abuse (and you were trying to backpedal and say it wasn&#39;t; that was what made me think of denial). <br>
<br>
And this, too, is two steps from solid:  -=-I don&#39;t recall suggesting victimhood or denial. -=-<br>
You don&#39;t need to &quot;recall&quot;—it&#39;s a written conversation.  <br>
You could have written &quot;I didn&#39;t say &quot;victimhood&quot; or &quot;denial.&quot; <br>
Instead of<span class="ygrps-yiv-115321475"><br>
I don&#39;t recall<br>
suggesting<br>
victimhood or denial.<br>
<br></span>
IF (just if) your regular mode of communication is to coat words in words and then have introductory phrases, that will very likely cause children not to understand you, first of all; not to take you seriously; and eventually not to listen to you.<br>
<br>
Think of what you want to communicate and do it in three or five words.  With feeling.  Be the lead partner in your relationship.  Take care of your children.  Be solid.  <br>
That&#39;s for anyone, and everyone, who tends to fall into &quot;Well, sweetie, I understand that you might be feeling frustrated, but your sister doesn&#39;t want to be hit and when you yell it hurts mommy&#39;s ears, so please find a way to be more peaceful&quot; instead of &quot;HEY.  Stop.  Leave her alone.&quot;  <br>

<br/>
If there&#39;s not an option, don&#39;t call it &quot;a request.&quot;  Don&#39;t pretend he has an option if he doesn&#39;t. That would piss me off, if I were a kid.<br/>
<br/>
A request IS a question. <br/>
<br/>
Instead of writing more (and you&#39;re writing A LOT), please <br/>
Read a little<br/>
Try a little<br/>
Wait a while<br/>
Watch<br/>
<br/>
-=-If I said &quot;Please stop hitting me&quot;, I could describe that as having asked him to stop hitting me. He was asked to stop hitting. -=-<br/>
<br/>
It gives him the option NOT to stop hitting you.<br/>
<br/>
-=- But when I speak to my children I don&#39;t say &quot;I want less hitting.&quot; -=-<br/>
<br/>
When you decided to write to this group, you said &quot;less.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
If you could read this paragraph aloud to yourself (but aloud, for real), I think you might see what some of the problem is.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-It would not make sense to write &quot;I didn&#39;t say &quot;victimhood&quot; or &quot;denial&quot;. When nobody said that I had written those words. It was implied that I had suggested those things, not that I had typed those words.  I did not write words that said I was suggesting victimhood or denial but something I wrote could have given you the impression that I was suggesting it.

You call it not being solid. I call it leaving room for having a different opinion. -=-<br/>
<br/>
The guidelines for posting in this group say this (and a bit more, but not much):<br/>
<br/>
ALL posts should be<br/>
	• honest<br/>
	• proofread<br/>
	• sincere<br/>
	• clear<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/lists/alwayslearningPOSTS">http://sandradodd.com/lists/alwayslearningPOSTS</a><br/>
<br/>
Write exactly what you mean, and what is true, after thinking about it carefully.  Write it in such a way that others will understand it.  <br/>
More words is not the answer.  Simple clarity is good, but first a write must be clear internally.   &quot;The form of a request&quot; is a question. <br/>

<br/>
It doesn&#39;t get heard.  It becomes wallpaper blah blah blah blah in a sing-songie tone of voice.   And the sister is still being hit during the speech.  And the other child is thinking the mother is a wimp.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/tone">http://sandradodd.com/tone</a><br/>
From that link (which has more and other, about tone of voice), first me, then Dan Vilter:<br/>
<br/>
Even the nicest of words can be ruined, though, if they&#39;re spoken in a condescending, treacly way. It&#39;s not bad for infants, and it&#39;s great for French poodles. It&#39;s that talking-to-a-French-poodle voice, and the thoughts that go with it, that should be avoided when parents are talking to their children. Dan Vilter shared this story on the AlwaysLearning list in 2001:<br/>
<br/>
At a park day, we were having a discussion about the usefulness of praise and sincerity. The unschoolers in the group were trying to point out the fallacy of over and insincere praise, and indirectly about treating your children as people first. After much talk getting nowhere, one of the other unschooling parents turned to me and in the French poodle voice started thanking me for all the things I had done for the group that day. Something like,&quot;Oh Dan, thank you for bringing the stove for hot cocoa. You did such a good job setting it up and heating the water! You&#39;re so strong carrying that big jug of water all by yourself!&quot; Everyone had a good laugh and the point was succinctly made.<br/>
<br/>
(It was Pam Sorooshian who said what he&#39;s quoting, that day at their meet-up, to demonstrate.)<br/>
<br/>
-=- It recognizes that we all get disregulated sometimes-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Disregulated is another two-steps-from-clarity term.<br/>
<br/>
We should not be &quot;regulated&quot; in the first place, so to be &quot;disregulated&quot; is far, far from making a thoughtful decision.<br/>
