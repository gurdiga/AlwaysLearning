<div id="ygrps-yiv-1658196291">I came across this browsing the news during a break at work.  I just<br/>
thought it was interesting as I love how time and again, nature proves how<br/>
smart the animals are.<br/>

Whales Eating Cod Off Fishermen&#39;s Lines    <br/>

<br/>
ANCHORAGE, Alaska - Sperm whales have the largest brain of any animal and<br/>
some in the Gulf of Alaska are proving it at mealtimes: letting humans do<br/>
all the work. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Researchers are now investigating what commercial fisherman have long<br/>
noticed, that the whales have learned to pluck sablefish off hooks<br/>
attached to their long fishing lines. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;They somehow just pick them off like grapes,&quot; said fisherman Dick Curran,<br/>
who has fished the gulf&#39;s deep waters for decades. &quot;I don&#39;t know how they<br/>
do it.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No one knows how the whales have come to target sablefish, also called<br/>
black cod, whose oily, rich flesh has become a lucrative product in<br/>
Japanese markets. So a coalition of commercial fishermen and biologists<br/>
has begun to investigate with about $200,000 from the North Pacific<br/>
Research Board. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We don&#39;t want the fishermen to have an economic loss. Plus it&#39;s a<br/>
biological loss, because we don&#39;t know how many sablefish are being<br/>
taken,&quot; said whale specialist Jan Straley, a lead investigator in the<br/>
project. &quot;My interest is biological, and I really want to understand what<br/>
these whales are doing.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To harvest black cod, fishermen sink a 2-mile-long line with baited hooks<br/>
every 3 to 6 feet. Each end is anchored to the sea floor along the<br/>
continental slope and buoyed at the surface. After an 8- to 12-hour<br/>
&quot;soak,&quot; fishermen haul the line, sometimes harvesting hundreds of<br/>
sablefish in a single set. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Over the past few decades, some of the gulf sperm whales apparently<br/>
realized that fishermen were bringing this deep food source to the<br/>
surface, and learned to remove a 20- to 30-inch fish from hooks. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No one likes to get fewer fish, but take one look at those big whales and<br/>
you realize you&#39;re out of your league,&quot; said longliner Dan Falvey, who,<br/>
along with Curran, is one of 10 fishermen working with Straley. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sperm whales find prey with their extraordinary hearing, able to perceive<br/>
their environment with echoed clicks and other sounds. The whales have yet<br/>
to get seriously hurt or entangled in the sablefish gear, according to<br/>
fishery managers and whale biologists. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Straley and her partners have found after one season suggests that male<br/>
sperm whales may patrol the edge of the continental shelf, where the water<br/>
is 1,200 to 3,000 feet deep, and wait for fishing boats. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;For sure they know the sound of hydraulics engaging. ... It&#39;s like<br/>
ringing the dinner bell for them,&quot; said Linda Behnken, director of the<br/>
Alaska Longline Fishermen&#39;s Association, which is coordinating the study. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Everyone knows whales are smart, and they&#39;re proving it,&quot; she added.<br/>

I don&#39;t understand this.  Whether people or whales are taking them, they&#39;re <br/>
being taken by other animals.   I think it&#39;s a loss to their being able to <br/>
think they have count of what&#39;s going on.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe they could isolate a whale sound that says &quot;This stuff tastes TERRIBLE&quot; <br/>
or something and broadcast it from those bouys.<br/>
