<div id="ygrps-yiv-156649030">My elderly neighbor, Harry, just came over.  He&#39;s 90 or so, and doens&#39;t walk <br/>
so well, but heard I was housebound and walked over to give me a CD called <br/>
Shakespeare--the Greatest Hits.  I didn&#39;t know who was at the door  until <br/>
Harry himself came into my office.   I sat in the wheelchair and he stood in <br/>
the doorway, or leaned on my bookshelf, while he was here.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
First, about the CD:<br/>
Three songs in a row on the CD were It Was a Lover and his Lass, Edi Beo, and <br/>
Greensleeves.  I told him the first we sing in my wednesday night music group <br/>
which is starting up again next Wednesday, the second I just learned <br/>
yesterday is on Holly&#39;s new fiddle CD (performed by me and her teacher, <br/>
switching parts, me on recorder), and the third I just wrote about this <br/>
morning, with the words of &quot;What Child is This.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He said I didn&#39;t have to bring it back, that he has all those songs in other <br/>
arrangements, and it&#39;s a big monotonous as it is on this, but he thought I <br/>
might want to have it.  I did.<br/>
<br/>
Then we talked about Lord of the Rings.  He doesn&#39;t have a DVD player or I <br/>
would have loaned him mine.  He was disappointed in the movie and told me <br/>
exactly why and which scenes.  Mostly he didn&#39;t like the meeting between <br/>
Gandalf and Sauramun.  And he was right.<br/>
<br/>
I told him to try again.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He talked about Christianity, of a nice Japanese Jehovah&#39;s Witness who comes <br/>
by sometimes, about the Dead Sea Scrolls, which he said he used to buy and <br/>
read in every new translation.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We talked about Seven Years in Tibet, which I&#39;m reading.  He told me about <br/>
having been in China before the Communist takeover.  He even said &quot;God <br/>
damned&quot; although he covered his mouth and apologized.  We talked about <br/>
Tibetan culture and Buddhism.  <br/>
<br/>
I kept one of his descriptions in me word for word.  I was afraid I would <br/>
only remember the rubber. . .marble part, but look how much I could quote!:<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;After lights up I went up on one of the gundecks for a smoke.  It was one <br/>
of those Pacific calms. The ship was riding like a rubber-tired dolly on a <br/>
marble floor, and the moon came up (and he showed with his hands so big on <br/>
the horizon) golden, and made a path on the water right to and up onto the <br/>
ship.  And I thought that was my yellow brick road to Oz, but I couldn&#39;t walk <br/>
on it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I asked if he had been to Okinawa.  He hadn&#39;t, but he said he was on ship <br/>
during part of the Okinawan hurricane, and told me some good stories of how <br/>
it was on stairs (ladders), how it was in the bunks.<br/>
<br/>
Harry talks slowly, and always gets onto opera (which he did, and talked <br/>
about Verdi&#39;s politics for a while, and Italy&#39;s history, which I kinda zoned <br/>
out on), but I&#39;m impressed with what he knows and his way with words.<br/>
<br/>
I thought in light of recent discussions, some of you would find parts of <br/>
this interesting.<br/>
