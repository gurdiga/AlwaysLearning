The Kindergarten teacher was attempting to teach the children to use less baby <br/>
talk and more big people words.<br/>
<br/>
When she asked little Johnnie how he spent the weekend, he replied,  &quot;I went <br/>
to <br/>
see my Nana&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No, Johnnie, you went to see your Grandmother.  Remember to use big people <br/>
words.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The next child replied to the question with &quot;We went on a ride on a choo-choo!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Now, remember to use the big people words.  You went for a ride on a train&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The third child proudly announced that he had read a book.   &quot;Good for you!  <br/>
What book did you read?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Winnie the shit!&quot;</div>
