Hi Mimi, <br/>
<br/>
To me you are sooooo on.  I also come from a very controlling and repressive <br/>
mother.  The biggest thing that I remember about my childhood is being <br/>
totally powerless.  I couldn&#39;t wait to get out and get away.  My daughter is <br/>
four and we just began homeschooling 4 months ago.  I found that I was taking <br/>
the same route my mother took with me and didn&#39;t want that for her.  I found <br/>
I was creating a little &quot;perfect pet&quot;.  When I realized that my goals for her <br/>
were to grow up as a confident, independent, strong, female.........I <br/>
realized that what I was doing would turn her out just the opposite.  I&#39;ve <br/>
changed so dramatically in the last few months.  You bet, we still have <br/>
&quot;house-rules&quot;, but I&#39;m so much more relaxed.  I give her so many more <br/>
breaks.......gosh knows that I need someone to allow me them.  I do not spoil <br/>
and  I expect her to be within the boundaries.  However, SHE&#39;S FOUR.....I&#39;ve <br/>
learned to let her be four.  <br/>
<br/>
I appreciate your honesty.  It is hard when you were raised one way and our <br/>
now trying to reprogram yourself.  I do it everyday, and know that I doing <br/>
the best for my family.  Isn&#39;t that what homeschooling is about?  What is <br/>
best for our particular children and family?  <br/>
<br/>
Kindest Regards,<br/>

motivators in getting over my repressive mother. And when Sandra once wrote<br/>
about finding ways to say &quot;yes&quot; to our children, I saw another way I had been<br/>
carrying my father around - whenever we asked him anything, he didn&#39;t even need<br/>
to hear the end of the question before saying &quot;no&quot;.  I had that similar<br/>
knee-jerk response.  Now I say yes as much as possible.<br/>

Before someone says I always tell my kids yes, here&#39;s the deal:<br/>
<br/>
Some people think they&#39;re being good parents by saying &quot;no.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And some people say no and then qualify it quickly, like &quot;NO, not until after <br/>
dinner,&quot; or &quot;NO, not today.&quot;<br/>

I think parents should say yes twenty times to every no.<br/>
<br/>
And maybe the &quot;no&quot; should be...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;NO, I don&#39;t want to make Holly go to bed.&quot;<br/>
&quot;No, you don&#39;t have to come back right away.&quot;<br/>
&quot;No, you don&#39;t have to finish your food.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When parents are going to feel bad if they don&#39;t say no, maybe (when the iron <br/>
is cold--good concept!) they should make up lists of things they can say no <br/>
about.<br/>
<br/>
NO, I don&#39;t mind if you use my stuff.<br/>
No, it won&#39;t bother me if you have a party.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-770594751">This was on a site called Stepfamilies of America or some such.<br/>
I&#39;m even more offended at the idea of these principles being applied by <br/>
stepparents.<br/>
<br/>
From here down is not me.<br/>
<br/>
Bill of Rights for Children<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Because it is the most character-building, two-letter word in the English <br/>
language, children have the right to hear their parents say &quot;No&quot; at least <br/>
three times a day. <br/>
Children have the right to find out early in their lives that their parents <br/>
don&#39;t exist to make them happy, but to offer them the opportunity to learn <br/>
the skills they-children-will need to eventually make themselves happy. <br/>
Children have a right to scream all they want over the decisions their <br/>
parents make, albeit their parents have the right to confine said screaming <br/>
to certain areas of their homes. <br/>
Children have the right to find out early that their parents care deeply for <br/>
them but don&#39;t give a hoot what their children think about them at any given <br/>
moment in time. <br/>
Because it is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, children <br/>
have the right to hear their parents say &quot;Because I said so&quot; on a regular and <br/>
frequent basis. <br/>
Because it is the most character-building activity a child can engage in, <br/>
children have the right to share significantly in the doing of household <br/>
chores. <br/>
Every child has the right to discover early in life that he isn&#39;t the center <br/>
of the universe (or his family or his parents&#39; lives) that he isn&#39;t a big <br/>
fish in a small pond, that he isn&#39;t the Second Coming, and that he&#39;s not <br/>
even-in the total scheme of things-very important at all, no one is, so as to <br/>
prevent him from becoming an insufferable brat. <br/>
Children have the right to learn to be grateful for what they receive, <br/>
therefore, they have the right to receive all of what they truly need and <br/>
very little of what they simply want. <br/>
Children have the right to learn early in their lives that obedience to <br/>
legitimate authority is not optional, that there are consequences for <br/>
disobedience, and that said consequences are memorable and, therefore, <br/>
persuasive. <br/>
Every child has the right to parents who love him/her enough to make sure <br/>
he/she enjoys all of the above Rights. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The author of these &quot;Bill of Rights&quot; is John Rosemond, a family psychologist <br/>
who writes a weekly column which is published in over 200 newspapers. He <br/>
gives terrific, common sense advice to parents. His web site is <br/>

I would have never found him praised in La Leche League or Adult Children of <br/>
Alcoholics or Unschooling groups, I think.  The background that shaped my <br/>
parenting was way different from whatever his is.<br/>
