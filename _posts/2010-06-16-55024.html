<div id="ygrps-yiv-646485280">Below is something I&#39;ve just sent to a new member, and I have a couple  <br/>
of things to say about it:  I&#39;m in Maui today, not Albuquerque-as- <br/>
usual.  For serious... I do have better things to do than return  <br/>
posts.  And yes, I could just approve &quot;me too&quot; posts, but I care SO  <br/>
MUCH about the Always Learning list that I&#39;m willing to keep it strong  <br/>
and good even when the wind is blowing through palm trees ten feet  <br/>
from  me.<br/>
<br/>
SO.  ANYone who is the least bit unsure of why I would be writing this  <br/>
should keep reading.<br/>
And thank you to those who DO read their intro e-mails and who are  <br/>
careful when posting.   This list is an extremely valuable resource.   <br/>
Please help me keep it that way.<br/>
<br/>
=================================================================<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry to be returning two in one day ... but this just isn&#39;t useful.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve quoted more than you&#39;ve written, and what you wrote isn&#39;t  <br/>
adding to the discussion.  It won&#39;t help anyone understanding  <br/>
unschooling better, nor does it ask a question that can be answered in  <br/>
such ways that other people have new ideas.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve just joined the list, I see.  It&#39;s too soon to post anything.<br/>
While you&#39;re reading and getting used to the list, please read these  <br/>
two pages.  One should have come as an intro, by e-mail.  Both are in  <br/>
files at the yahoogroups page, but are more easily read here:<br/>
