<div id="ygrps-yiv-1522034092">There could be more than two chats a week if other people want to  <br/>
commit to be there.  I might or might not be at more than two a week;  <br/>
I don&#39;t want to commit to more than those two.<br/>
<br/>
No one at the chats has to write anything.  For those who don&#39;t type  <br/>
really fast it can probably seem too overwhelming.  For those who  <br/>
don&#39;t read quickly, also it could fly on by too fast.  But for people  <br/>
who would like to be in a quick-paced discussion, there&#39;s one in a  <br/>
couple of hours and another Friday (every week for the foreseeable  <br/>
future):<br/>
