I may be the only one that totally understands what you&#39;re talking about when <br/>
you say Tamzin &quot;blanks&quot; people!! My dd does the same thing. No it&#39;s not any <br/>
type of seizure or reaction to bad behavior, it just happens. They choose not <br/>
to acknowlege a person in any way....not look at them, not talk. My dd&#39;s is a <br/>
bit more regular though. Anyone she doesn&#39;t know (and quite a few she does <br/>
know) get &quot;blanked&quot; every time!! It&#39;s kinda weird. I do think it&#39;s a version <br/>
of being shy.<br/>
It&#39;s a bit embarrassing sometimes, like tonight. We were invited to a three <br/>
y.o.&#39;s Birthday party. She blanked everyone there, including the adorable <br/>
little three y.o. that was sweetly talking to her and trying to be friends.<br/>
I don&#39;t see my dd trying to make friends with other kids...ever. But once a <br/>
child has been around her for a while, like our unschool friends, she opens <br/>
up and plays nicely.<br/>
I just feel bad because people think she doesn&#39;t like them or something.<br/>
Don&#39;t see how anything I do will help, other than just be supportive, <br/>
understanding and wait for it to pass.<br/>
Any ideas would be great though!!<br/>
Tamzin isn&#39;t the only one.<br/>
But Sierra is four, I really hope she outgrows this by seven!!! oh well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1028887869">I&#39;m wondering if this could be related to how people process<br/>
information?  Like the Myers-Brings typing? Some children overload and<br/>
withdraw -- not rudeness at all but just temperament.<br/>
