<div id="ygrps-yiv-624116284">Ok it is done.<br/>
 I got yet another call from the school today. First from the office <br/>
asking why I allowed both my girls to stay home yesterday and spend <br/>
the day with me. I informed them that with my work sec. it was the <br/>
only time I had to see them, and entire family took days off work <br/>
ext. write them down excused parent or sick  (call it mommy iddess, <br/>
witch ever I didn&#39;t care)<br/>
  Then the next was from my Daughter in tears again. We had gotten <br/>
her hair cut yesterday and the girls where making fun of her writing <br/>
on the bathroom walls and so forth. Even threatened to kill her again <br/>
and beat her up, for getting her hair cut.<br/>
I had had it. Daughter wanted to come home I told them release her <br/>
they said just because she is being picked on .I told them for get it <br/>
I will be right there. I met daughter in hall and said you sure you <br/>
want to do this now she said please mom. We marched into the <br/>
superintendent&#39;s office asked for the paper work was asked why and I <br/>
re told them why. They gave me the paper work and we went to the <br/>
locker and cleaned it out. Turned in the books and said we are done.<br/>
    So now here is my dilemma on the paper work it says I have to <br/>
have special permission it reads:<br/>
No. #8. If the child is currently identified as a child requiring in <br/>
special education prior approval must be sought from the special <br/>
education director at the Area Education Agency if this is the first <br/>
year that the child will be receiving Competent Privet instruction in <br/>
Iowa. Iowa code section 200A.9<br/>
  If she had a IEP is she one that needs special permission?<br/>
I told her she didn&#39;t have to go back. And I will not lie to her. <br/>
Next Monday is nest day during the day I have off and will make a <br/>
trip to the homeschool in Kolona and see if I can transfer her there, <br/>
and bypass it all. But thought I would inform here to progress. And <br/>
ask for advice.<br/>

<br/>
If there is &quot;a homeschool in Kolona,&quot; it&#39;s probably a school-system program <br/>
(guessing, from other programs of which I&#39;m aware in other places like New  <br/>
Mexico and California).  But if that will get you past the IEP problem, fine!<br/>
<br/>
If you have anything on the special ed folks, you could just hold them at bay <br/>
with that.  If they&#39;ve abused or neglected her or failed to protect her or <br/>
something, you could say &quot;OKAY!  You don&#39;t want to clear her to homeschool?  <br/>
Let&#39;s go to the superintendent together so I can discuss this [whatever <br/>
situation]&quot; (or you could do that in writing) and they will probably back <br/>
down rather than mess with an adrenalated mom.<br/>
