Expectations<br/>
<br/>

It was my first outing alone as a new mom, and I was trying to nurse <br/>
discreetly. After getting my daughter latched on, I looked around--had <br/>
anyone been watching? Did anyone see me, or any part of me? Id read <br/>
about moms being asked to cover up, go to the bathroom, or leave&would <br/>
that happen to me? Sure enough marching directly toward me was an older <br/>
lady with a scowl on her face.<br/>
I wanted to run, but Lexie was just now nursing well, so I made myself <br/>
be still. Was this woman going to tell me to go someplace private to <br/>
feed my baby? Or maybe it was the fact I was a white woman with a dark, <br/>
obviously bi-racial child. My husband and I had been together for years, <br/>
people had been rude to us in the past. One woman, obviously an older <br/>
one like the one coming so quickly toward me, had phoned our house for <br/>
weeks after our engagement announcement had appeared in the local paper, <br/>
begging me not to marry, leaving long messages about the dangers of <br/>
interracial marriage. I knew when I married my husband and decided to <br/>
have children that racism was going to be something we would <br/>
encounterbut I had not wanted to encounter it while feeding my newborn <br/>
baby.<br/>
The woman sat down beside me, and leaned over to get a good look. She <br/>
was about 80 and her face was lined, so that her mouth looked like it <br/>
was always frowning. I couldnt tell what she was thinking, but thinking <br/>
she was, it was obvious she had something to say and I was sure I didnt <br/>
want to hear it! I remembered once a few years before when I had <br/>
complained to my mother about people giving Mark and me dirty looks. My <br/>
mother told me that I had a choice. I could be negative, decide that the <br/>
look was directed at me, and internalize those negative feelings, <br/>
becoming annoyed, angry and upset. My day would be ruined. Or I could <br/>
make another choice. I could choose to think that those people were <br/>
simply admiring us. That they felt we were a lovely, attractive couple <br/>
and that it was wonderful that we were together. I could then lift my <br/>
head and smile at them.<br/>
I had followed this advice for years, and I found that it did make a <br/>
difference. Sometimes people werent giving me a dirty look but were <br/>
looking at the price of eggs behind me, or thinking of their job or the <br/>
laundry they needed to do. Either way, when I changed my attitude, and <br/>
simply lifted my head and smiled, those same people often would smile at <br/>
me. And if they didnt, it was still ok, because I was not allowing <br/>
their attitude to affect memy choice was to simply smile, and walk on. <br/>
And so now, I did the same thing. I simply smiled at her and gazed at my <br/>
baby. Then she spoke.<br/>
Good for you!<br/>
I must have looked confused because she went on, Good for you for <br/>
breastfeeding. So many moms are not breastfeeding today.<br/>
I was shocked, but she didnt notice, she just began to talk. She talked <br/>
about her children and how she nursed them all for a long time, you <br/>
dont want to know how long! She spoke about how people would get mad <br/>
because she would nurse her babies anywhere. I would never feed them on <br/>
the toilet, when my babies were hungry I would just nurse them. She <br/>
talked about how sad she was when her daughters did not breastfeed her <br/>
grandchildren, but she brightened as she spoke about how her <br/>
granddaughter was due any day now with her first great-grandchild. She <br/>
was leaving next week and hoped to be there before the birth, her <br/>
granddaughter wanted her help with the new baby, and with breastfeeding. <br/>
And I sat there, my daughter comfortably in my arms, and this woman, <br/>
whom I had prejudged so harshly, smiling at her excitement, and glad <br/>
that I had smiled at her.<br/>
She talked for a while, but I could tell there was something else she <br/>
wanted. After a bit Lexie finished and came off the breast with that <br/>
milky grin I had already grown to love. The woman smiled at it herself <br/>
and then, cautiously, asked if she could hold my baby. I hesitated for a <br/>
minute and then realized this old woman couldnt get far, and handed my <br/>
daughter over to her. With practiced, sure hands, she held Lexie up for <br/>
a minute and told my daughter what a beautiful child she was. Then this <br/>
strong woman, who had obviously earned every wrinkle in her face, pulled <br/>
my daughter close to her and said, I think this is how my great <br/>
grandchild will look. You see, my granddaughter married a black man. <br/>
What a fuss that was, in my family. Didnt know I was related to so many <br/>
damn fools! She raised her eyes in disgust. They all told my <br/>
granddaughter that Id never allow it, that I was too old to accept a <br/>
black grandson-in-law. But I put them straight. I danced at their <br/>
wedding, when other folks refused to attend. And now Im going Arizona <br/>
to see my new grandbaby!<br/>
I watched her cuddle my child, and watched my child cuddle into this <br/>
remarkable woman. After a bit, she gently placed Lexie back into my <br/>
arms, and as she stood, she thanked me for letting her hold my baby.</div>
