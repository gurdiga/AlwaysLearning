to remind me of the positive discipline board I was on that spent all its time<br/>
discussing how to punish the kids. :-(  But redefine it as &quot;positive&quot; so it&#39;s OK.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;m over at the unschooling.com e-mail list trying to explain why the<br/>
&gt; &gt; terms &quot;educational&quot; would best be dropped from the vocabulary in<br/>
&gt; &gt; order to fully embrace the unschool mindset.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m WITH you on that one Ren.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But -- interestingly, among some of my good friends (all unschooling types),<br/>
&gt; we find ourselves using that word in a very different way. &quot;The tour was<br/>
&gt; okay, but a little too &#39;educational,&#39;&quot; or &quot;Well, we tried that but it was too<br/>
&gt; &#39;educational&#39; for us.&quot; &quot;I found these scripts of plays the kids might enjoy<br/>
&gt; putting on -- they&#39;re pretty cool even if they&#39;re a little overly<br/>
&gt; &#39;educational&#39;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So - it is a sort of codeword, I think, for stuff that is just too<br/>
&gt; ....something..? Too fake? Too superficial? Too contrived. That&#39;s it, I<br/>
&gt; think.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If someone said, &quot;Oh, yeah, we went to that museum. It was very educational,&quot;<br/>
&gt; I wouldn&#39;t know if that was a good thing or not. I&#39;d just like to hear, &quot;Oh,<br/>
&gt; yeah, we had a great time at the museum and there was cool stuff there and I<br/>
&gt; learned a whole lot about it.&quot; For so many of us, &quot;educational&quot; carries the<br/>
&gt; implication that someone shoved something down some poor kids&#39; throats &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And of course there is the argument that you&#39;re probably making, Ren, that to<br/>
&gt; say one thing IS educational implies that other things are not. From an<br/>
&gt; unschooling point of view that is sort of a nonsense position.<br/>

I agree that the word educational is bandied about all<br/>
over the place and basically doesn&#39;t have any meaning<br/>
for me. It&#39;s like if it has the word &#39;educational&#39; in<br/>
it, then people think it must be good. But I don&#39;t get<br/>
the connection between saying something is educational<br/>
means that everything else isn&#39;t. It&#39;s different if<br/>
someone is actually comparing different museums (for<br/>
example) and they say that a particular one is<br/>
educational. Then that implies, to me, that the others<br/>
are not. But if, in passing, someone says a certain<br/>
museum is educational. I don&#39;t take it to mean that<br/>
they believe that every other museum is not.<br/>
If I were to use that logic, if someone said to me,<br/>
&#39;your friend Richard is very intelligent&#39;, then I<br/>
would have to assume that the person who commented<br/>
thought the rest of my friends were not.<br/>
My point is that I think you can express an opinion<br/>
about something without negating everything else in<br/>
that category. Does that make sense? I&#39;m having a hard<br/>
time expressing myself this evening for some reason<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1512375231">&lt;&lt;  It&#39;s different if<br/>

<br/>
For people to become  unschoolers to the bone, they need to be comparing <br/>
everything all the time until they come to a place where they see the <br/>
learning potential in every single moment.  And so for them using the word <br/>
&quot;educational&quot; about ANYTHING is a comparison to other things.  If some things <br/>
are and some things are not, then you can&#39;t say &quot;everything is.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But if, in passing, someone says a certain<br/>
museum is educational. I don&#39;t take it to mean that<br/>
they believe that every other museum is not.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Depends on the tone of voice and context. <br/>
<br/>
But clearly they are saying it is more educational that some other museum(s) <br/>
they have in mind or imagination.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If I were to use that logic, if someone said to me,<br/>
&#39;your friend Richard is very intelligent&#39;, then I<br/>
would have to assume that the person who commented<br/>
thought the rest of my friends were not.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Depending on your other friends, and the tone of voice your friend uses, he <br/>
might mean that very thing.   Some people do have the tone of surprise when <br/>
they way &quot;Wow!  You&#39;re really nice!&quot;  and the underlying message is &quot;nicer <br/>
than I thought you&#39;d be&quot; or &quot;nicer than I&#39;d heard you were.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;My point is that I think you can express an opinion<br/>
about something without negating everything else in<br/>
that category. Does that make sense?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Generally, but I think in a discussion of unschooling and the term <br/>
&quot;educational&quot; it doesn&#39;t apply.<br/>

Ahhh, I didn&#39;t get that it was in the context of a<br/>
discussion about unschooling. I thought we were<br/>
talking in more &#39;general&#39; terms (as in people that<br/>
don&#39;t have a clue &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
