<div id="ygrps-yiv-705591233">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for pointing out the tone of Deb&#39;s post. It was my first time <br/>
posting and I did not realize you all have a sense of humor (Ha Ha).<br/>

Well, unless she&#39;s MAD! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s funny when she&#39;s mad.<br/>
<br/>
And for future reference, it&#39;s my list, so if I want to pick on somebody I <br/>
can.<br/>
Nobody&#39;s paying me to run this list, there&#39;s no board of directors, it&#39;s just <br/>
like one of those CRAZY little independent filling stations that can charge <br/>
too much for gas, sell whatever weird stuff they want at the counter, has the <br/>
TV blasting and some benches for people to hang out.<br/>
<br/>
You COULD go to the big Texaco on the corner where they have exactly what the <br/>
corporation told them to have on the shelves in the very corporate places, or <br/>
you can hang out and take your chances on what&#39;s TV here.<br/>
<br/>
People learn more at the independent place than the &quot;what town or street <br/>
corner is THIS one on?&quot; shop.<br/>
