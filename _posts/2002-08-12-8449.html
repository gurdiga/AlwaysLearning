<div id="ygrps-yiv-321560015">***How can a child who has never had any choices EVER &quot;choose&quot; to eat<br/>
vegetables?***<br/>
<br/>
Yes, and I watched one friend try the -let them eat what they like-<br/>
approach and then claim it didn&#39;t work because all they ate was junk. <br/>
She bought what they asked for at the store, but nothing else that they<br/>
might have chosen at home instead of the &quot;junk&quot;.   So when all there was<br/>
to snack on, chips and cookies, etc, was really all there was, no<br/>
cherries, no melon, no carrots etc.  they did just eat the &quot;junk&quot; but<br/>
that wasn&#39;t choice.   That was just hunger and availability.  <br/>
So she proudly says she tried it, but &quot;it just doesn&#39;t work with MY<br/>
kids&quot;.... *sigh*.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1365463174">I just read all the messages about food choice etc. I totally <br/>
advocate kids being able to regulate their own food intake. Someone <br/>
mentioned calories though and yes to a certain extent kids need <br/>
calories but not if its all sugar and saturrated fat. If you eat <br/>
healthy food yourself, then your kids are going to enjoy healthy food <br/>
and want to eat it. Its no good complaining about your kids eating <br/>
nothingh but junk( and we&#39;ve all done it!!) if we are the ones who <br/>
buy the junk in the first place! If you are a family which cooks <br/>
everything from scratch and the kids get involved in this then they <br/>
will learn what they need to make certain things, so when you are <br/>
shopping they can easily tell you what they would like to buy to make <br/>
something which they want to eat. I dont have a problem with food <br/>
fads, thats not to say my kids dont have them, but the food they do <br/>
want to eat all the time is decent healthy stuff. My youngest ate <br/>
nothing but peanut butter sandwiches for some periods when he was <br/>
younger, but he did drink a lot of juice and also fruit and other <br/>
healthy snacks, so i guess it could have been worse. <br/>
I dont think we should try to impose our own likes and dislikes on <br/>
kids. If you have agood selection of wholesome food in the house then <br/>
they should take what they need and not make themselves hungry.<br/>
I do believe that breastfeeding on cue, where the baby can have free <br/>
access to the breast, is a good start to the child learning that s/he <br/>
is in control of his/her own eating, and as they start to be old <br/>
enough for solid food(not those yucky commercial jars!)about 6 months <br/>
old if you are breastfeeding, then sitting them at the table with you <br/>
and allowing them to help themselves to your stuff, or put some on <br/>
their own plate, this encourages them to learn that it&#39;s up to them <br/>
what they like and dislike.<br/>
All kids, unless the parents are total fascists, will encounter and <br/>
eat junk food, but so what? If they have ahealthy balanced diet and <br/>
are not just getting sugar jags/lows all day they won&#39;t crave the <br/>
instant rush that junk food gives.<br/>
I just read a brilliant book, called Sugar Blues, by William Dufty. <br/>
It opened my eyes i can tell you!<br/>
We are vegetarian but i have never forced my kids to be veggies, my <br/>
eldest was not brought up in a veggie home,as my ex husband is a meat <br/>
eater. My youngest has chosen for himself to be veggie. I know veggie <br/>
parents who think that it would be a bad influence for their kids to <br/>
be offered meat. Why? My son has been offered meat, fish etc. He has <br/>
a mouth, he can say no(or he may say yes if he wants, who knows?) Why <br/>
is it so important for vegetarians to want their kids to be veggies? <br/>
Yes, it is, but its more important that they have their own choices <br/>
and that they are veggies because they want and choose to be, rather <br/>
than because they have to.<br/>
Well, thats my bit. We just have to do what we can to make sure our <br/>
kids are healthy. After all you wouldnt let your kids take crack, or <br/>
smoke a cigarette, because they dont know the facts. Its the same <br/>
with food. Until they are old enough to know about food, we tend to <br/>
give them what we think is healthy, then hopefully by the time they <br/>
are old enough to choose, they will know anyway what is &quot;good&quot; <br/>
or &quot;bad&quot;. But i did draw the line at sweets(candy to you <br/>
Americans/canadians) with all those colourings in, and anyway ny <br/>
yougest really didnt recognise themas edble!<br/>
