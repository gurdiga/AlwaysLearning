<div id="ygrps-yiv-1561505630">This is the first time I&#39;ve done a long complicated page and the  <br/>
formatting came out right the very first time!<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/day/meme">http://sandradodd.com/day/meme</a><br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s Ronnie Maier (dragonfly / df)&#39;s responses to a meme going around  <br/>
Facebook and some blogs.   Hers were awesome.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll announce it the way I announce pages, with the e-mail list and  <br/>
the blog<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com">http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com</a><br/>
<br/>
but I was pretty excited about looking at it and seeing all the  <br/>
indents and colors and links were right the first time!<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t have bottom links to other pages yet, but it will after a  <br/>
while (before I announce it on the other places).<br/>
