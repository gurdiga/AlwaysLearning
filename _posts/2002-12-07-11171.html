<div id="ygrps-yiv-1426392840">All that talk about Vegas got me thinking of wisking my hubby away from here <br/>
for our 13th anniversary next month.  So, since it&#39;s our lucky 13th &lt;g&gt;, <br/>
Vegas is it!<br/>
<br/>
It will have to be a long weekend, though.  My question is simple.  Is there <br/>
any benefit to making it a S-S-M-T weekend as opposed to a Th-F-S-S weekend?  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Like, for instance, I know if I&#39;m in Chicago on Thursday, I can get into <br/>
Museum of Science and Industry for free.  (Or used to could, anyway!)  <br/>
<br/>
Anything I need to know like that about Vegas?  We probably won&#39;t gamble <br/>
much--just go for the fun of it and the being alone together somewhere else.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1125227436">Vegas rooms are cheaper by a ton on Sunday through thursday nights.  A <br/>
Sat-sun weekend is OK.  So yes, there is a HUGE difference.  A hotel on <br/>
a sat could be 100 and the same room be 20 on a sunday night.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I&#39;m finding that out!  We always try to travel off peak, attend museums <br/>
after 1:00 so all the school kids will be gone, and go to weekday matinees <br/>
when we can!  Tricks of the homeschooling trade!  lol.<br/>
