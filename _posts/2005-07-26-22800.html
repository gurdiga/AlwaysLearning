<div id="ygrps-yiv-680098789">Julia and I read a really good book today. It&#39;s a<br/>
Newbery &quot;Number the Stars&quot; by Lois Lowry. The<br/>
storyline is about a girl living in Denmark during the<br/>
Nazi occupation. She has to do some very brave things<br/>
to help her Jewish friend. The book is well written<br/>
and raised several questions leading to discussions<br/>
and looking things up on the internet. We highly<br/>
recommend it.<br/>

I love all of Lois Lowery&#39;s books. The Giver, Gathering Blue, Number <br/>
the Stars---and we just read one that is a prequel to The Giver, but I <br/>
can&#39;t remember the title.<br/>
<br/>
Six might be young---but I think I may have read The Giver to Duncan <br/>
first when he was six. He&#39;s nine now and had a BUNCH of questions to <br/>
that prequel.<br/>
<br/>
Her books are though-provoking and can be a bit disturbing. Not in a <br/>
*bad* way. Just in a &quot;got-to-think-about-that&quot; way. Hard to explain. <br/>
They&#39;re sweetly written---but with an edge. You might want to read one <br/>
to yourself first, just to see.<br/>

Is Messenger one of her books?<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t think that was the prequel to The Giver, but it was  very much like <br/>
it.  We heard it on CD from Cracker Barrel, so I don&#39;t have  it here to look.  <br/>
We liked it.  <br/>

Yes, it was The Messenger. Thanks. And we listened to it on CD too.<br/>
<br/>
Are you sure it wasn&#39;t a preqeul? Or a sequel? It had a lot of the same <br/>
images and names---like they were related.<br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;ll need to go back and read them both again.<br/>

Yes, I kept thinking that, but it&#39;s been 15 years since I read  The Giver.  <br/>
It may be...I dunno.<br/>

Number the Stars is a breathtaking story, beautifully written. It&#39;s also very sad. You know your children best but I would say that most 6 year olds are not ready for a story of this intensity, mine weren&#39;t. I would reccommend reading it yourself and then deciding. <br/>
