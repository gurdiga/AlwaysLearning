That was in a recent post.<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure the saying is &quot;one fell swoop&quot;...uh oh, I went and  <br/>
checked and it seems that foul *is* replacing fell. I thought that  <br/>
fell meant quickly, not evilly!<br/>

This reminds me of a funny story. My husband has a phrase &quot;all talk  <br/>
and no haircut&quot;, which I thought referred to a barber who talked to  <br/>
much and didnt do his job. I used the phrase talking to Deb C. at the  <br/>
Live n Learn conference this past month. She said she&#39;d never heard  <br/>
it before.<br/>
well...turns out that I&#39;ve been mis-hearing it from my husband, and  <br/>
it&#39;s really &quot;all talk *and* a haircut&quot; and my husband said it refers  <br/>
to a cop, and it kind of means all bluster and a uniform, or  <br/>
something to that effect. Not how I heard it or used it AT ALL! lol<br/>
<br/>
I guess I should have my hearing checked because my mother in law  <br/>
always says things are like &quot;tits on a bull&quot; (useless) but for YEARS  <br/>
I thought she was saying &quot;tits on a bowl&quot; and while I understood that  <br/>
meant useless, I didnt really get it. :)<br/>
<br/>
Once on a message board, a woman told a story about how someone  <br/>
called her child a toe-head and she was totally disgusted and enraged.<br/>
We assured her that the person surely meant towhead which refers to a  <br/>
blond haired person.<br/>

I ran across one earlier this evening.  Oh, took me a while to remember and<br/>
find it.  This is from this page:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/writing">http://sandradodd.com/writing</a>   A<br/>

windows covered with plastic, and a rusted old rod iron fence around a<br/>
pathetic excuse for a garden. I entered through a front door that was much<br/>
shorter than I remembered. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure she means a rusted old wrought iron.  (Or wraught, which is<br/>
how I wanted to spell it but Microsoft doesn&#39;t agree with me, but turns out<br/>
that&#39;s correct too at least according to<br/>

Oh!  She surely meant wrought iron.  My niece Gina wrote that.  And  <br/>
what makes it cooler is that her dad is a welder who has made a LOT  <br/>
of very cool iron gates and fences for fancy houses and government  <br/>
buildings in Santa Fe.<br/>
<br/>
My dad was a welder too.  Here is what welders work with:  welding rod.<br/>
So I&#39;m guessing she confused the two.    And in the local accent,  <br/>
there&#39;s not much difference in sound between &quot;rod iron&quot; and &quot;wrought  <br/>
iron.&quot;  It&#39;s not going to have a hard &quot;t&quot; sound.<br/>

Not that it is a &quot;saying&quot;, but the one that really bugs me is  <br/>
&quot;irregardless&quot;. I have a friend who says that and when I remind her that the  term is <br/>
&quot;regardless&quot;, she shrugs and carelessly says, &quot;Oh, I know...&quot; Oh, and &quot;I  could care <br/>
less&quot; when folks really mean &quot;I couldn&#39;t care less&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
Dave crosses words sometimes when he&#39;s using sayings. The first time he  came <br/>
to my house to meet my parents, he was explaining to me how smart his  little <br/>
sister was, &quot;She has a mind like a trap door&quot; he said. It still makes me  <br/>
smile, today. And that could work-stuff/information falling into a trap door and  <br/>
not coming back out, it just sounded so funny hearing similar-sounding, but  <br/>
different words in that common saying.<br/>
 <br/>
Then there are the funny ones (on purpose) on Lion King, like when  Pumba <br/>
says, &quot;You&#39;ve got to put your behind in your past.&quot; which for the longest  time, <br/>
I thought he was saying &quot;You&#39;ve got to put your behind in your *pants*&quot;,  <br/>
which sounds almost exactly the same, but has quite a different meaning! :~D (I  <br/>
still like &quot;pants&quot; better!) Pumba also says to Simba when he finds out he&#39;s  <br/>
really &quot;the king&quot;, &quot;I gravel at your feet&quot;, which I find funny not only because  <br/>
it sounds so close, but that&#39;s where gravel usually is-at your feet! :~D<br/>

Not a saying but someone recently posted that some parents can&#39;t give  <br/>
up the dillusion of control.<br/>
<br/>
I thought that was awesome! A combination of delusion and illusion.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-736084773">My grandfather wrote the welding textbook that was  used in almost  <br/>
every welding program in the United States for about 25 or 30 years.  <br/>
It was published in 1944 by McGraw-Hill - &quot;Arc and Acetylene Welding,&quot;  <br/>
by Harry Kerwin (my pre-marriage name was Pam Kerwin).<br/>
<br/>
I have a copy of it (bought it on e-bay). Most of it is technical, of  <br/>
course, but I love it because the writing is old-fashioned and sweet  <br/>
and earnest just like my grandpa was. After he wrote this book, he  <br/>
went to college (so did my grandmother). They then went into the  <br/>
foreign service and helped establish vocational education programs in  <br/>
several countries - first was Libya and then Iran and then Turkey. My  <br/>
grandfather was also part of a United Nations peacekeeping mission to  <br/>
Cyprus. He learned to speak, fairly fluently, Arabic, Farsi, and  <br/>
Turkish. When he &quot;retired&quot; they moved to Sacramento, California, and  <br/>
he served as an advisor on vocational education to the California  <br/>
State Superintendent of Education.<br/>
<br/>
The book starts out with &quot;The Welder&#39;s Pledge.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I, ____________, desire to be known as a first-class welder. I  <br/>
understand the obligations and responsibilities placed upon me. I  <br/>
realize that great property damage and possibly loss of life may  <br/>
result from a poor weld. Therefore I pledge myself to the following  <br/>
articles:<br/>
<br/>
1. Never to be guilty of knowingly making a poor weld.<br/>
2. To report immediately to my superior any weld that I believe is not  <br/>
thoroughly dependable for the service for which it is intended.<br/>
3. To do all in my power to advance the cause of welding.<br/>
4. To give my employer, at all times, my best effort, loyal service,  <br/>
and honest workmanship.<br/>
5. To strive each day to increase my knowledge and skill in the art of  <br/>
welding.<br/>
6. To extend all possible assistance to welders less proficient than  <br/>
myself.<br/>
7. Realizing the appearance as well as quality is important in a weld,  <br/>
always strive to improve my workmanship.<br/>
8. Always to be punctual.<br/>
9. To the best of my ability to work in harmony with my fellow workers.<br/>
10. To expect a wage commensurate with my ability.<br/>
<br/>

I think this is an example of the other way around.  Dip wad has to  <br/>
do with dipping snuff or chewing tobacco or some such.  After that  <br/>
didn&#39;t make sense to younger people, they started making it something  <br/>
nastier.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t think of another example, but I know there are a few, of  <br/>
something slightly insulting being transformed (gradually or for  <br/>
fun?) to something nastier, and then catching on.<br/>

<br/>
Mondegreen<br/>
<br/>
 From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondegreen">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondegreen</a><br/>
<br/>
A mondegreen is the mishearing or misinterpretation of a phrase,  <br/>
typically a standardized phrase such as a line in a poem or a lyric  <br/>
in a song, due to near homophony.[1][2] It should not be confused  <br/>
with Soramimis, which are songs that produce different meanings to  <br/>
those originally intended, when interpreted in another language.<br/>
<br/>
Etymology<br/>
<br/>
The American writer Sylvia Wright coined the term mondegreen in an  <br/>
essay &quot;The Death of Lady Mondegreen,&quot; which was published in Harper&#39;s  <br/>
Magazine in November 1954.[3] In the essay, Wright described how, as  <br/>
a young girl, she misheard the final line of the first stanza from  <br/>
the 17th century ballad &quot;The Bonnie Earl O&#39; Murray.&quot; She wrote:<br/>
<br/>
When I was a child, my mother used to read aloud to me from Percy&#39;s  <br/>
Reliques, and one of my favorite poems began, as I remember:<br/>
<br/>
Ye Highlands and ye Lowlands,<br/>
Oh, where hae ye been?<br/>
They hae slain the Earl Amurray, [sic]<br/>
And Lady Mondegreen.<br/>
<br/>
The actual fourth line is &quot;And laid him on the green.&quot; As Wright  <br/>
explained the need for a new term, &quot;The point about what I shall  <br/>
hereafter call mondegreens, since no one else has thought up a word  <br/>
for them, is that they are better than the original.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Other examples Wright suggested are:<br/>
<br/>
•	Surely Good Mrs. Murphy shall follow me all the days of my life  <br/>
(&quot;Surely goodness and mercy…&quot; from Psalm 23)<br/>
<br/>
•	The wild, strange battle cry &quot;Haffely, Gaffely, Gaffely,  <br/>
Gonward.&quot; (&quot;Half a league, half a league,/ Half a league onward,&quot;  <br/>
from &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
The columnists William Safire of The New York Times and, later, Jon  <br/>
Carroll of the San Francisco Chronicle have long been popularizers of  <br/>
the term and collectors of mondegreens. They may have been the chief  <br/>
links between Wright&#39;s work and the general popularity of the notion  <br/>
today.<br/>
<br/>
In 2008, it was announced that the word had been added to Merriam- <br/>
Webster&#39;s Collegiate Dictionary.[4][5]<br/>
<br/>
Role in culture<br/>
<br/>
While mondegreens are a common occurrence for children, many adults  <br/>
have their own collection, particularly with regard to popular music.<br/>
<br/>
Quite a few mondegreens may be seen in closed-captioned live  <br/>
television broadcasting of impromptu speeches, interviews, etc. (for  <br/>
example, a local news report of a &quot;grand parade&quot; might be captioned  <br/>
as a &quot;Grandpa raid&quot;). The prevalence of mondegreens in this context  <br/>
arises in part from the use of stenotype machines and the need for  <br/>
captions to keep up with the fast pace of programs. This machine is  <br/>
used not to type out words directly as a common keyboard but rather  <br/>
to record the syllables of the words being spoken. Thus, the  <br/>
stenographic recording is a phonetic transcription of the words being  <br/>
spoken. Software is then used to translate the phonetic syllables  <br/>
into proper words. Given some unusual syllabic constructions, and the  <br/>
sophistication of the software, errors come in as the system tries to  <br/>
distinguish where the word break is in the syllable stream.  <br/>
Typically, the software uses pre-programmed information that matches  <br/>
syllable clusters to written forms, then suggests captions from which  <br/>
a human &quot;captionist&quot; chooses. Mistakes may come from inadequacies in  <br/>
the program&#39;s recognition capability, from the failure to provide the  <br/>
software with vocabulary specific to the context, from the  <br/>
captionist&#39;s own mishearing of the words, or from the need for the  <br/>
captionist to make a decision before an ambiguous statement is made  <br/>
clear by what is said next.<br/>
<br/>
In popular culture<br/>
<br/>
See also: Soramimi<br/>
<br/>
Some mondegreens arise from &quot;false friends&quot; or false cognates. In  <br/>
both cases a phrase in one language may be misheard as a semi- <br/>
sensical phrase in another language, called a Soramimi. The humorous  <br/>
aspect of these has given rise to a music video genre known as  <br/>
animutation, in which music in a different language (often Japanese,  <br/>
although others such as Swedish exist) is &quot;misheard&quot; into English,  <br/>
and illustrated. Engrish mondegreens can also occur when English  <br/>
lyrics are reproduced by singers of Asian languages.<br/>
<br/>
This may happen in the opposite direction as well: i.e., English  <br/>
words of a song are misheard, intentionally or not, to mean something  <br/>
else in a native language, often with a humorous effect. An example  <br/>
is a Russian joke in which the song &quot;Can&#39;t Buy Me Love&quot; was announced  <br/>
as &quot;кинь бабе лом&quot; (pronounced [kinʲ babʲe lom]), which  <br/>
roughly translates as &quot;Throw a crowbar to the old woman&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Examples in song lyrics<br/>
<br/>
	•	The &quot;top 3&quot; mondegreens submitted regularly to mondegreen expert  <br/>
Jon Carroll are:[1]<br/>
<br/>
	1.	Gladly the cross-eyed bear[3] (from the line in the hymn &quot;Keep  <br/>
Thou My Way&quot; by Fanny Crosby, &quot;Kept by Thy tender care, gladly the  <br/>
cross I&#39;ll bear&quot;)[6] Carroll and many others quote it as &quot;Gladly the  <br/>
cross I&#39;d bear&quot;. Ed McBain used the mondegreen as the title of a  <br/>
novel. Also, this mondegreen is paraphrased by the band They Might Be  <br/>
Giants in their song &quot;Hide Away Folk Family&quot; (Sadly the cross-eyed  <br/>
bear&#39;s been put to sleep behind the stairs, and his shoes are laced  <br/>
with irony.)<br/>
<br/>
	2.	There&#39;s a bathroom on the right (the line at the end of each  <br/>
verse of &quot;Bad Moon Rising&quot; by Creedence Clearwater Revival: &quot;There&#39;s  <br/>
a bad moon on the rise&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
	3.	&#39;Scuse me while I kiss this guy (from a lyric in the song &quot;Purple  <br/>
Haze&quot;, by Jimi Hendrix: &quot;&#39;Scuse me while I kiss the sky&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
Both Creedence&#39;s John Fogerty and Hendrix eventually capitalized on  <br/>
these mishearings and deliberately sang the &quot;mondegreen&quot; versions of  <br/>
their songs in concert.[7][8][9]<br/>
<br/>
	•	The film &quot;Angels In The Outfield&quot; makes a reference to the  <br/>
mishearing of mistakes &quot;O, say can you see&quot; from The Star-Spangled  <br/>
Banner as &quot;José can you see?&quot;.[10] Bill Dana used this mondegreen in  <br/>
a comedy bit as the Hispanic character José Jimenez. Columnist Mike  <br/>
Royko made the same joke about José Cardenal after the ballplayer had  <br/>
recovered from an eye infection. In Beverly Cleary&#39;s children&#39;s novel  <br/>
Ramona the Pest, Ramona refers to the &quot;Dawnzer lee light&quot; (dawn&#39;s  <br/>
early light).<br/>
<br/>
	•	In Stevie Nicks&#39; song Edge of Seventeen the line &quot;Just Like a  <br/>
White Winged Dove&quot; is often misheard as &quot;Just like a One Winged  <br/>
Dove&quot;. [11][12][13][14] The title itself originated from a mishearing  <br/>
of &quot;age of seventeen&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
	•	In an episode of the television sitcom Friends, Phoebe believes  <br/>
the lyric from Elton John&#39;s &quot;Tiny Dancer&quot;, &quot;Hold me closer, tiny  <br/>
dancer&quot; is actually &quot;Hold me close, young Tony Danza.&quot;[15]<br/>
<br/>
	•	In the CBS sitcom The Nanny, &quot;The girl with kaleidoscope eyes,&quot;  <br/>
from the song &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot; by The Beatles, is  <br/>
misheard as &quot;The girl with colitis goes by.&quot;[1]<br/>
<br/>
	•	&quot;A wean in a manger,&quot; using the Scottish word for a baby, instead  <br/>
of &quot;Away in a Manger.&quot; Gervase Phinn used &quot;A Wayne in a Manger&quot; as  <br/>
the title of a book about a children&#39;s nativity play.[16]<br/>
<br/>
	•	&quot;Tell the Huns it&#39;s time for me&quot; (from the song &quot;Beneath the  <br/>
Lights of Home (In a Little Sleepy Town)&quot; sung by Deanna Durbin in  <br/>
Nice Girl? (1941): &quot;Turn the hands of time for me&quot;) on the BBC radio  <br/>
programme Quote Unquote in 2002.[17]<br/>
<br/>
	•	Mairzy Doats, a 1943 novelty song by Milton Drake, Al Hoffman and  <br/>
Jerry Livingston, works the other way around. The lyrics are already  <br/>
a mondegreen (the song is sung in a fake West-country accent), and  <br/>
it&#39;s up to the listener to figure out what they mean. The refrain of  <br/>
the song repeats nonsensical sounding lines:<br/>
<br/>
Mairzy doats and dozy doats and liddle lamzy divey<br/>
A kiddley divey too, wooden shoe (or, if you prefer, &quot;wouldn&#39;t chew&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
The only clue to the actual meaning of the words is contained in the  <br/>
bridge:<br/>
<br/>
If the words sound queer and funny to your ear, a little bit jumbled  <br/>
and jivey,<br/>
Sing &quot;Mares eat oats and does eat oats and little lambs eat ivy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 From this point, the ear can figure out that the last line of the  <br/>
refrain is &quot;A kid&#39;ll eat ivy too; wouldn&#39;t you?&quot;, but this last line  <br/>
is only sung in the song as a mondegreen.<br/>
<br/>
	•	The Joni Mitchell cover of the Lambert, Hendricks & Ross song  <br/>
&quot;Twisted&quot; includes a mondegreen: the original lyric They all laughed  <br/>
at A. Graham Bell was misheard and subsequently recorded by Mitchell  <br/>
as They all laugh at angry young men.[18]<br/>
<br/>
	•	Mike Sutton, a mondegreen director on YouTube with the username  <br/>
&quot;Buffalax&quot;, uploaded several non-English music videos which were  <br/>
edited to include subtitles of the written English approximation of  <br/>
the video&#39;s original language&#39;s sound. These include Internet memes  <br/>
such as Moskau (originally German), Tunak Tunak Tun (originally  <br/>
Punjabi), Indian Thriller (originally Telugu) and Benny Lava  <br/>
(originally Tamil). The latter, involving the video for Prabhu Deva  <br/>
Sundaram&#39;s song, &quot;Kalluri Vaanil&quot; from the Indian Tamil movie, Pennin  <br/>
Manathai Thottu, has occasionally been referred to as &quot;the web&#39;s  <br/>
hottest clip&quot; [19] On the Internet, both the terms &quot;Buffalaxed&quot; and  <br/>
&quot;Benny lava&quot; are now synonymous with mondegreens, &quot;words or phrases  <br/>
misheard in ways that yield new meanings.&quot;[20][21]<br/>
<br/>
Examples in television<br/>
<br/>
	•	&quot;Mondegreens&quot; is the name of a segment on the Australian music  <br/>
quiz show Spicks and Specks (ABC TV).<br/>
<br/>
Other examples<br/>
<br/>
	•	A controversial example is found in the movie Who Framed Roger  <br/>
Rabbit, where Donald Duck in a scene chastises Daffy Duck, exclaiming  <br/>
&quot;Doggone stubborn little...&quot; Donald&#39;s quacks have frequently been  <br/>
misheard as &quot;God damn stupid nigger&quot;, resulting in a hard-to-put-down  <br/>
urban legend.[22]<br/>
<br/>
	•	The games Mad Gab and Babble-On feature mondegreens as puzzles  <br/>
for players to solve.<br/>
<br/>
Examples in languages other than English<br/>
<br/>
Hebrew<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Naturally, mondegreens are a universal phenomenon. They often occur  <br/>
with songs taught to groups of children by nannies or teachers. An  <br/>
Israeli example is mukhrakhím liyót saméakh ‘We must be happy’  <br/>
instead of (the high-register) úru akhím belév saméakh ‘Wake up,  <br/>
brothers, with a happy heart’, from the well-known song Háva  <br/>
Nagíla (Let’s be Happy). Thus, a foreigner interested in learning  <br/>
the original song had better not ask an Israeli for its lyrics.  <br/>
Consider also the ‘non-phonetic mondegreen’ (employing  <br/>
‘mondegreen’ more broadly) with the Israeli children’s song  <br/>
úga, úga, úga, bámagal nakhúga. The original meaning is ‘Round,  <br/>
round, round, let us move in a circle’ but it is interpreted by most  <br/>
Israeli children as the homophonous ‘cake, cake, cake, let us move  <br/>
in a circle’, cf. Israeli [Hebrew] ugá ‘cake’ (note that úga  <br/>
‘round, roll, draw a circle! (masculine, singular)’ is outdated).  <br/>
This song might have made many Israeli children perceive the default,  <br/>
unmarked cake as round – like Yiddish kúgļ ‘kugel, kind of  <br/>
pudding’ (popularly etymologized as Israeli [Hebrew] keigul ‘like  <br/>
a circle’) and Yiddish shtrúdļ ‘strudel, type of fruit  <br/>
cake’.&quot;[23]<br/>

I love English.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of people don&#39;t love English any more than I love mathematical  <br/>
equations and axioms (in the &quot;memorize these, there will be a test&quot;  <br/>
way).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2004989192">Another good source of these is the newsletter Scott Adams (of Dilbert<br/>
fame) sends out over email.  He will have quotes or stories about<br/>
&quot;induhviduals&quot; where people can submit mistakes like that, written or<br/>
spoken.  Many are mondegreens, but there are also lots of other verbal<br/>
mistakes like combining sayings and also just people being ditzy.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I sent one in at one point.  My sister and I were staying at a hotel<br/>
in Amstradam and there was a sign on the door with rules and<br/>
disclaimers.   One of them was something like &quot;Hotel is not<br/>
responsible for loss of values.&quot;  As the hotel was in the red light<br/>
district (oops), I found it rather funny.<br/>
<br/>
I also like <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.engrish.com/">http://www.engrish.com/</a> which has a lot of strange things<br/>
written in English by non-native speakers.<br/>
<br/>
Another mistake that cracked me up is that I was reading a manhwa and<br/>
the main character had a hat that had the F word on it in huge<br/>
letters.  He was a rather coarse fellow, so it didn&#39;t seem<br/>
unreasonable.  What was funny is that whenever he spoke he used tame<br/>
alternate swear words and never, in the entire manhwa, said anything<br/>
as strong as what his hat said.   Sometimes the clothes people wear in<br/>
asian books and shows say really funny things.<br/>

Oh! Which reminds me of another (hopefully) mispronunciation I often hear:  <br/>
prostate/prostrate. That one always jumps out at me loud and clear.<br/>
