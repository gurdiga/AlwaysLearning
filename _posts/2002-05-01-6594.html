I think that if it doesn&#39;t interfere with his (and your son&#39;s) love of <br/>
robotics, it shouldn&#39;t matter. You can&#39;t change him. You CAN get as much <br/>
knowledge from him about robotics and avoid any discussion of race relations <br/>

If this were a genetics class---or anthropology or sociology--it would <br/>
probably make a big difference. It&#39;s robotics (are white robots better?).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>but what is your definition of &quot;at risk?&quot;<br/>
I&#39;m assuming the teacher is white, but what<br/>
is the race of the child?  Is it OK for the<br/>
child to have contact with a racist person if<br/>
the child is of the same race, but it would<br/>
be wrong if the child was black or another<br/>
race? Isn&#39;t that idea racist?<br/>
<br/>
One reason we homeschool is because research<br/>
says that black childrne are touched less<br/>
than white children.  And dark black children<br/>
are touched less than light black children.<br/>
This is true even if the teacher is black<br/>
herself and doesn&#39;t have a website saying<br/>
whites are better.  It is true even if the<br/>
teacher is teaching something not related to<br/>
race or social studies.  How we interact with<br/>
others is important. Body language is 60-80%<br/>
of our communication, and is very powerful.<br/>
<br/>
Another reason is because of subtle messages.<br/>
I read an article about this little girl who<br/>
in 2nd grade was doing wonderfully.  Then in<br/>
3rd grade she started having problems.<br/>
Teacher reporting lots of problems, problems<br/>
getting along with kids, with teachers, etc.<br/>
At a conference, the teacher said things like<br/>
&quot;she just doesn&#39;t seem to know who to be<br/>
friends with&quot; and other telling statements<br/>
that let the parents know the teacher felt<br/>
the child had social issues.  The teacher<br/>
also said she was having problems with math.<br/>
Ends up the teacher had decided that as the<br/>
child was multiracial that the child was<br/>
going to have problems figuring out whether<br/>
she was black or white, and have problems<br/>
knowing who she should be firends with, the<br/>
black kids or the white kids.  The teacher<br/>
also assumed the child would have problems in<br/>
math and in other areas.  The parents removed<br/>
the child from that classroom and the<br/>
&quot;problems&quot; went away.  The teacher, I&#39;m sure,<br/>
was unaware of her own inherent racism and<br/>
how it affected her relationship with the<br/>
child and expectations of the child.<br/>
<br/>
Subtle racism is everywhere and I don&#39;t<br/>
particularly want it to hurt my children more<br/>
than necessary. I cannot control every aspect<br/>
of their lives but I can control a lot of it,<br/>
especially when they are younger.  As you<br/>
said, we don&#39;t know the hidden interests of<br/>
people around us, but in this case, we DO<br/>
know the hidden interest of this man.<br/>
<br/>
Last night I did a home visit (I&#39;m a LLL<br/>
Leader).  As I&#39;m asking my usual questions, I<br/>
ask about circ.  Baby is intact and I know my<br/>
relief was apparent.  This is my bias.  The<br/>
mom noticed this and asked me and I just said<br/>
the standard line of how babies that are<br/>
circed often have problems breastfeeding, but<br/>
my bias showed.  We ALL have biases, and they<br/>
will come out. I certainly don&#39;t want a<br/>
person&#39;s bias against black people to come<br/>
out while that person is teaching my<br/>
daughter, even if the subject matter has<br/>
nothing to do with black people.<br/>
<br/>
My husband clearly remembers when a teacher<br/>
told him that he shouldn&#39;t be running for<br/>
student body president or taking honors<br/>
English because he wasn&#39;t going to be able to<br/>
go to college anyway, he might as well take<br/>
auto shop and learn a trade.  The young<br/>
college age checker at the grocery store<br/>
didn&#39;t realize what his words meant when he<br/>
asked me, in front of my two children, how<br/>
long I&#39;d had my &quot;foster children.&quot;  White<br/>
lady, black children, those kids must be in<br/>
foster care.  Whether the ignorant statements<br/>
or messages are intended to cause pain or<br/>
not, they have the same ability to cause<br/>
pain.  People often say intentions are<br/>
important, think about intent.  And that&#39;s<br/>
true, but when the little old white lady rubs<br/>
my child&#39;s hair and says &quot;she&#39;s so pretty and<br/>
smart, oh she is so pretty, what a beautiful<br/>
child, oh what beautiful skin&quot; and my own<br/>
skin is crawling with her forced attempt at<br/>
trying not to be racist and  my insticts are<br/>
telling me she surely is--well, intent means<br/>
nothing.  Subtle racism, even when you can&#39;t<br/>
quite put a finger on it, when you just know<br/>
something isn&#39;t right, is still racism and<br/>
still causes harm.<br/>
<br/>
Many years ago when I complained to my mom<br/>
about the dirty looks my then fiance and I<br/>
got when we went someplace, my mom made a<br/>
very intersting comment.  She said &quot;you can<br/>
either assume they are looking at you because<br/>
they dislike the fact you are with a black<br/>
man or that Mark is with a white woman or you<br/>
can assume that they are thinking what a nice<br/>
looking couple you are, and you can smile<br/>
back at them.&quot;  I thought about this and<br/>
realized that she was right.  Now,<br/>
occasionally, they really are looking at us<br/>
with disgust and hate but by smiling at them<br/>
I am not allowing their hate to change my<br/>
outlook, and occassionally I find that I am<br/>
wrong.  I did the same with breastfeeding in<br/>
public.  People would scrowl at me and I<br/>
woudl simply lift my head, smile at them, and<br/>
assume they were admiring my beautiful baby.<br/>
But these are strangers, and would I want one<br/>
of these racist bigots to have contact with<br/>
my child?  I don&#39;t think so. I&#39;ve choosen<br/>
that my children don&#39;t have contact with<br/>
their great grandmother because she is a<br/>
racist bigot, although they have met her a<br/>
few times with me hovering close.  I would<br/>
never leave them alone together, not until<br/>
they are much older and better able to handle<br/>
things.  But then again, I was in my late<br/>
20&#39;s when she disowned me for marrying a<br/>
black man, and I can&#39;t say I handled it well,<br/>
and I still feel the pain--so when will they<br/>
be old enough?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure all of us can think back and<br/>
remember one comment or one incident that has<br/>
changed us, either for good, or for bad.   I<br/>
remember my 10th grade writing teacher<br/>
telling me that I would never be a writer,<br/>
which is and has always been my dream.  &quot;Find<br/>
something else to do Joylyn, because you&#39;ll<br/>
never be a writer.&quot;  I still almost want to<br/>
cry when I think of those hurtful words,<br/>
still remember her name (Mrs. Sleeter, I<br/>
called her Mrs. sleezebutt), the room where<br/>
we were, and how I felt afterwards.  Each of<br/>
us has the power to affect a child&#39;s life,<br/>
and I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to<br/>
allow a child to be with a man who obviously<br/>
has a different opinion on such an important<br/>
subject.<br/>
<br/>
I admit I haven&#39;t been following this<br/>
conversation too closely, so I don&#39;t remember<br/>
the age of the child, the length of contact,<br/>
if the child is alone with the man or if the<br/>
parent is present at all times, etc.  All<br/>
those are factors.  Also, does the man know<br/>
how you feel, that you know his personal<br/>
beliefs and that while you respect him as an<br/>
expert on Robots you do not share his beliefs<br/>
and that you wish for him to make an effort<br/>
to not share those beliefs with the child?<br/>
If he is open to this type of relationship,<br/>
and if for the most part a parent will be<br/>
there at all times, supervising the contact,<br/>
then I&#39;d say that it would probably be OK.<br/>
If he says that his beliefs are vital to his<br/>
being and that he doesn&#39;t leave them at the<br/>
door, then that is a different story. I can<br/>
understand and respect that viewpoint--I<br/>
unfortunately have many racists in my family,<br/>
and my children and I are not welcome in some<br/>
of their homes--which brings the question....<br/>
Do I WANT my children to have contact with<br/>
such people, relatives or not.  For the most<br/>
part the answer is no, but in reality I have<br/>
choosen to have limited contact with some of<br/>
these people, monitoring closely any contact<br/>
so that I can head off any problems.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I firmly believe that no person<br/>
can make my children believe something they<br/>
don&#39;t wish to believe, including myself. I<br/>
remember having discussions with Lexie, then<br/>
age 4, about Hell.  She firmly believed that<br/>
there was a hell, and I do not, and she would<br/>
not back down on her idea that hell was a<br/>
real physical place.  This is good (not that<br/>
she believes in hell but that she can stand<br/>
up to her believes,)   I think we need to<br/>
respect our children and trust that they will<br/>
make good decisions, and that they will not<br/>
be swayed by people that come into their<br/>
lives, just as we trust them to learn and<br/>
grow.  It&#39;s an interesting delima, on one<br/>
hand, to use my example from above, what<br/>
effect did the words my teacher use when I<br/>
was 15, in telling me I would never be a<br/>
professional writer, have on the fact that at<br/>
age 36 I still WANT to be a professional<br/>
writer but that I have difficulty buckling<br/>
down and doing it--I certainly wavered in<br/>
college, my degree is in English with an<br/>
emphases on writing and literature, but I<br/>
went into teaching.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I&#39;ve rambled enough, I guess in summary<br/>
I&#39;d say that I&#39;d think long and hard before<br/>
allowing my child constant and especially<br/>
unsupervised contact with someone who holds<br/>
such horrible beliefs.  If you&#39;ve read all of<br/>
this, thank you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2073535245">Some of the most prejudiced people I have<br/>
ever met have been black.<br/>
<br/>
THeir is a neighbor girl, Ajin.  She&#39;s<br/>
Korean.  She can play with Lexie at our<br/>
house, go into our house, etc. but she has<br/>
told us that Lexie is not allowed in her<br/>
house. Only Asian people can go into her<br/>
house, but we have seen another little girl<br/>
in her house, and that girl is white, so we<br/>
know that only black people are not allowed<br/>
in their house.  I really dislike this child,<br/>
she is so powerless, and she gets her power<br/>
off the other kids by setting them up and<br/>
then watching the fight.  I&#39;m pretty sure she<br/>
is being abused but have no proof and so<br/>
can&#39;t make a call or help.  She is a passive<br/>
aggressive little monster and I hate it when<br/>
she comes over but as Lexie says, &quot;it&#39;s not<br/>
Ajin&#39;s fault her parents are bigots.&quot;<br/>

&gt; We are friends with an African American<br/>
&gt; family.  The dad is pretty<br/>
&gt; prejudiced.  The mom and dad met at a<br/>
&gt; meeting of the Afro-American Student<br/>
&gt; Union in the early 1970&#39;s, in college.  The<br/>
&gt; dad can thereby assume the mother<br/>
&gt; will not be too stunned by a fairly<br/>
&gt; separatist attitude.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Unfortunately for him, they moved to<br/>
&gt; Albuquerque, and the kids have all white<br/>
&gt; friends so far.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Would it be okay for another Black family<br/>
&gt; to hang around with them?  (I think<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s okay for us to, but I know it&#39;s not as<br/>
&gt; pleasant for the dad as we&#39;d all<br/>
&gt; like for it to be, that his kids like me<br/>
&gt; and mine so much.)  Should only<br/>
&gt; other prejudiced people hang around with<br/>
&gt; him?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think we&#39;re softening him up.  (Not just<br/>
&gt; our family, but Albuquerque in<br/>
&gt; general--before they had lived in NYC,<br/>
&gt; Detroit and Houston, that I can<br/>
&gt; remember.)<br/>
