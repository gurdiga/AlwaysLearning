It looks like a leaf that looks like a brain (says the kids).  Is there <br/>
a story behind the pic?<br/>

It&#39;s from the fruitless mulberry by my back door.  That leaf grew  <br/>
funny, and fell on the hot tub.  I stuck it in the scanner with a  <br/>
piece of colored paper over it.  That&#39;s the whole story.<br/>

You were right!<br/>
<br/>
And I also guess I can never think of any image to represent  <br/>
unschooing, so I just like trees and tree parts.  I like the idea  <br/>
that each tree becomes itself from a little seed, and although people  <br/>
can help and encourage it and water it and keep it safe, or they can  <br/>
damage it or kill it, they can&#39;t make one kind of tree become a  <br/>
different kind of tree.<br/>

I&#39;d always assumed you&#39;d deliberately chosen that particular leaf<br/>
because it looks like a brain. There you go. :-)<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When we got the option to have a picture, I thought maybe there would  <br/>
be some good representation of unschooling, but pictures of people  <br/>
sometimes say too much, more than they intend to, and one picture  <br/>
can&#39;t represent the range of life and thought and activity and  <br/>
stillness and emotion.<br/>
<br/>
When that leaf fell I just liked the shape of it but I didn&#39;t think  <br/>
&quot;brain.&quot;  I kinda wondered what caused it to curl.  When I was a kid  <br/>
we bought a house with an apple orchard, and if an apple gets pecked  <br/>
or damaged when it&#39;s small, it will grow oddly.  Those never show up  <br/>
in the store, but the healthy side is perfectly edible.  I always  <br/>
thought those were interesting.  But I didn&#39;t consciously associate  <br/>
the leave with that either, until now.<br/>
<br/>
When I scanned it, I wasn&#39;t really thinking of this list either.   <br/>
Just was playing with my scanner, which I have done other times.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/scannerart">http://sandradodd.com/scannerart</a><br/>
<br/>
And it made a very clean and square picture that would look good  <br/>
small too, so I plugged it in to Always Learning, thinking maybe I&#39;d  <br/>
think of something better someday, and there it sat silently until  <br/>
this week.<br/>
