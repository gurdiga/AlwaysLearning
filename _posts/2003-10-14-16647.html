experience with Moly right now. Example, she was painting and came and asked <br/>
about a brush I have that she has never used. She wanted to know if she could <br/>
use it and how to use it. I explained it similar to another she has used and <br/>

and it really frustrates me when she comes to me later and says things like <br/>

not true. Like with the painting, she came later, crying, blaming me for her <br/>
not-turned-out-right picture. I tried to comfort her and tell her it looked <br/>
fine, but she wouldn&#39;t have it. All she did was stand and accuse me. &quot;YOU told me <br/>
it was JUST like that other brush.&quot; I wanted to say that I had tried to show <br/>
her how to use it, I wanted to say I didn&#39;t say it was just like the other <br/>
brush, but similar. I wanted to say a lot of things, #%@*!!! (It isn&#39;t like I was <br/>
trying to show her on her picture, I was in another room and had grabbed a <br/>
piece of scrap paper to show her on.) I wanted to be able to tell her I was <br/>
sorry, but I wasn&#39;t sorry and I honestly didn&#39;t think I had anything to be sorry <br/>
for. And this isn&#39;t a one time occurrence. It happens lots. She made cookies <br/>
one day. I tried to tell her that the powdered sugar is in a similar jar as the <br/>
one I keep the baking soda in. She *Knew* already. An hour later she had these <br/>
flat, falling apart, cookies and again, it was my fault. She mailed a bunch <br/>
of things to my Mom, she put stamps on, but not enough. I said we should <br/>
probably take it to the post office to weigh it and see how much postage she would <br/>
need. I told her I was going later that afternoon. She said she *Knew* how much <br/>
she needed, rolled her eyes and mailed it anyway. It was returned for <br/>
insufficient postage. Again MY FAULT. Argggh! My sweet child is frustrating me and <br/>
herself! I need to work through this with her, but I&#39;m not so sure how to go <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1338457341">When I get this reaction from my 5 almost 6 yo, it is usually because I have been conveying hte information in a preachy or teachy voice rather than the one I would use to give information to a friend.

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Marty used to say &quot;I know&quot; to me for a long time, when he was ten or eleven.<br/>
<br/>
About the time Kirby was born, I had a new friend.  He&#39;s still my friend, but <br/>
at the time he was 20 or so, just out of teens, and he hung around with me a <br/>
lot and he knows my family well.  Jeff Cunico.   Great guy.    We&#39;ve had many <br/>
adventures, mostly SCA related.  At the time I first hung out with him I was <br/>
queen and he was new.  17 years later he&#39;s been king five times. I was his <br/>
chief advisor a couple of those times, and often his editor/ghostwriter, speech <br/>
tweaker and counsellor.<br/>
<br/>
One time he said &quot;I learned to trust you not from the times I listened to <br/>
you, but from the times I didn&#39;t listen to you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think that can work with kids too.  There have been times I really wanted <br/>
to pull Kirby back and say &quot;NO REALLY, listen to me.  Your way is not going to <br/>
work.&quot;   And sometimes I have done just that.  But when I&#39;ve &quot;made&quot; him do it <br/>
my way, he learned less than when I said &quot;Well that&#39;s not what I would do, but <br/>
try it,&quot; and didn&#39;t hold him down squirming.<br/>
<br/>
The first weekend he took his new cash card out, despite our reminders to <br/>
choose his cash machines wisely, he ended up with $10 in charges.   That he will <br/>
remember well.  And he&#39;ll remember we were right.  And it only cost him $10! <br/>
&lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Nancy, with the stuff like the brushes or the postage, I think I would say &quot;I <br/>
think you say &#39;I know&#39; without realizing you say it, and it seems to mean <br/>
&#39;the conversation is over.&#39;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That makes it her turn to say something, or at least think.  You wouldn&#39;t <br/>
have to ask her to respond.  Just leave it lying there.  You might not be the <br/>
only person she&#39;s saying it to.<br/>
<br/>
With the brush, instead of telling her what the similarity is, if you think <br/>
she has a two-statement attention span, just give her the difference.    &quot;It <br/>
works differently from the other brush [in whatever way] so remember [whatever].&quot;<br/>
<br/>
With the postage, I just have a scale. It&#39;s old rates, but it&#39;s easy enough <br/>
to translate.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also a website, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://usps.com/">http://usps.com/</a><br/>
which will walk you through all kinds of postal stuff.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s calculate postage:<br/>

epostage<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s fun to just read what can and can&#39;t be sent to other countries.<br/>
<br/>
If you can slip that site into her consciousness or her favorite places <br/>
links, you bypass yourself as a middle-man or factor.<br/>

####################<br/>
<br/>
I think your suggestions are great, and thank you. I guess my problem is the <br/>
attitude. I have heard her use this same tone with others and it bothers me. <br/>
It bothers me because I wonder if she got that tone, response (I Know) and <br/>
attitude from me. (it also bothers me because one of the things I can&#39;t get rid of <br/>
is that old *what will they think* in the back of my head) I don&#39;t think she <br/>
did and I have been consciously listening to myself in conversations. Do I put <br/>
off people with eye rolling? Do I stop people who are trying to show/tell me <br/>
something with words like I know? I&#39;ve really been looking at that for a few <br/>
weeks now, I still don&#39;t see it in myself, and I hope I never do. I wonder <br/>
then, where did she get it? I ask myself if I am preachy or teacher like. Darin <br/>
says no, I&#39;m not, but he isn&#39;t exactly partial. I hope she grows out of this <br/>
like you said Kirby did. I don&#39;t want to force her to do things *my way* I grew <br/>
up like that. I don&#39;t want to chafe her. I keep my mouth shut most times when <br/>
she rolls her eyes and states she knows half way through even the shortest <br/>
statements telling her something. It&#39;s just coming to a head lately. Obviously I <br/>
can&#39;t expect her to know everything or that she know things like adults know <br/>
things and I don&#39;t want her life to be frustrating. It just seems like she is <br/>
making her life frustrating. Like the painting, she was frustrated that what she <br/>
wanted didn&#39;t happen. I could have said that she couldn&#39;t use that particular <br/>
brush, but I want her to be able to experience everything. I could have <br/>
ignored the other brush and just showed her how to use it, but she didn&#39;t give me <br/>
the chance to do even that. She was frustrated that the cookies were inedible. <br/>
I see that I could have just put the baking soda out for her and not said <br/>
anything about the powdered sugar being in a similar jar, I could have handed her <br/>
a few more stamps and said; &quot;this should do it.&quot; If I had though, would she <br/>
have resisted that as well? I guess I won&#39;t know. I&#39;m going to have to keep in <br/>
mind her frustrations and tailor my responses to her questions. And in the mean <br/>
time, hope she grows out of this need to make statements like &quot;I know&quot;. I <br/>
would love to come up with a gentle way to tell her that her tone and the eye <br/>
rolling puts people off, that it makes it so people don&#39;t want to tell her things <br/>
or show her how to do something. (me included) <br/>

I&#39;ve told my kids that they&#39;re communicating with more than words, and if <br/>
they want to be subtle, they need to be careful with posture and facial <br/>
expressions, eye rolling, tongue-clucking, etc., because they were DEFINITE signs of <br/>
disapproval and if they didn&#39;t want people to know they were expressing <br/>
negativity they needed to guard more than just words.<br/>

Not all that at once, but various parts and various times. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Poker face&quot; has been shorthand for that---forgot to say.  The kids will even <br/>
say it to each other, and Marty is good at exaggerated sarcastic facial <br/>
expressions as humor.  Like to amuse Holly, he&#39;ll say one thing to me and then make <br/>
ALL the hand and facial gestures that mean the opposite.   Like &quot;Sure Mom, <br/>
I&#39;d LOVE to,&quot; while putting on a whole mime show of how dumb it is and how he <br/>
really doesn&#39;t want to.<br/>
<br/>
He never does it for real, just for fun.  But the message is still there that <br/>
he DOES understand the non-verbal communications.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I guess i have found sharing my feelings has been helpful.  If you are hurt<br/>
or are getting a particular message -  sharing that gives her information. <br/>
She can decide how she wants to use that information.  I find my girls can<br/>
talk quite effectively about their feelings in a non-hurtful way because<br/>
that is how we all treat each other.   If you don&#39;t tell her it hurts you<br/>
or that you don&#39;t understand her message then how is she supposed to know? <br/>
I feel like the more information we can give the better.   It is still up<br/>
to the child to decide how to use it.  We may or may not like their choices<br/>
but at least we have been honest about our feelings and show them that<br/>
emotions and feelings can be expressed in a loving, non threatening way.   <br/>

I don&#39;t have any kids yet; I&#39;m just very interested in the whole concept of unschooling.  Could you tell her how you feel when she says &quot;I know&quot; in a particular tone?  It seems like it&#39;s very frustrating for you and you&#39;re trying to hold back for her sake.  What would happen if you didn&#39;t hold back? <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know about you, but when someone says &quot;I know&quot; to me in a particular tone or rolls their eyes at me, it really pushes my buttons because I feel I&#39;m not being respected or taken seriously.  Could you share the way you&#39;re feeling with your daughter and find a solution together?  Maybe she can better explain what she&#39;s feeling when she says &quot;I know.&quot;  And maybe knowing how you feel will give her a different perspective.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, anyone should set me straight if I&#39;m in complete la-la land here.  :)  I don&#39;t have a lot of practical experience with very young people.<br/>

<br/>
  That makes it her turn to say something, or at least think.  You wouldn&#39;t <br/>
  have to ask her to respond.  Just leave it lying there.  You might not be the <br/>
  only person she&#39;s saying it to.<br/>
  ####################<br/>
<br/>
  I think your suggestions are great, and thank you. I guess my problem is the <br/>
  attitude. I have heard her use this same tone with others and it bothers me. <br/>
  It bothers me because I wonder if she got that tone, response (I Know) and <br/>
  attitude from me. (it also bothers me because one of the things I can&#39;t get rid of <br/>
  is that old *what will they think* in the back of my head) I don&#39;t think she <br/>
  did and I have been consciously listening to myself in conversations. Do I put <br/>
  off people with eye rolling? Do I stop people who are trying to show/tell me <br/>
  something with words like I know? I&#39;ve really been looking at that for a few <br/>
  weeks now, I still don&#39;t see it in myself, and I hope I never do. I wonder <br/>
  then, where did she get it? I ask myself if I am preachy or teacher like. Darin <br/>
  says no, I&#39;m not, but he isn&#39;t exactly partial. I hope she grows out of this <br/>
  like you said Kirby did. I don&#39;t want to force her to do things *my way* I grew <br/>
  up like that. I don&#39;t want to chafe her. I keep my mouth shut most times when <br/>
  she rolls her eyes and states she knows half way through even the shortest <br/>
  statements telling her something. It&#39;s just coming to a head lately. Obviously I <br/>
  can&#39;t expect her to know everything or that she know things like adults know <br/>
  things and I don&#39;t want her life to be frustrating. It just seems like she is <br/>
  making her life frustrating. Like the painting, she was frustrated that what she <br/>
  wanted didn&#39;t happen. I could have said that she couldn&#39;t use that particular <br/>
  brush, but I want her to be able to experience everything. I could have <br/>
  ignored the other brush and just showed her how to use it, but she didn&#39;t give me <br/>
  the chance to do even that. She was frustrated that the cookies were inedible. <br/>
  I see that I could have just put the baking soda out for her and not said <br/>
  anything about the powdered sugar being in a similar jar, I could have handed her <br/>
  a few more stamps and said; &quot;this should do it.&quot; If I had though, would she <br/>
  have resisted that as well? I guess I won&#39;t know. I&#39;m going to have to keep in <br/>
  mind her frustrations and tailor my responses to her questions. And in the mean <br/>
  time, hope she grows out of this need to make statements like &quot;I know&quot;. I <br/>
  would love to come up with a gentle way to tell her that her tone and the eye <br/>
  rolling puts people off, that it makes it so people don&#39;t want to tell her things <br/>
  or show her how to do something. (me included) <br/>

often know! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I did talk to her about it directly - said that it was kind of annoying <br/>
because it felt like she was not valuing the information or help I was <br/>
offering. Pointed out that if she kept that up and did it with other <br/>
people they&#39;d be way less likely to offer information and help when she <br/>
DID want it. Also pointed out to her that there would be lots of times <br/>
in her life when people told her stuff she already knew and that it <br/>
could be kind of rude to point it out to them every time.<br/>
<br/>
Then I occasionally would say, &quot;Do you really know?&quot; Just kind of <br/>
casually to point out to her that she was saying it and I wasn&#39;t sure <br/>
if she meant it.<br/>
<br/>
Time went by. It stopped and I didn&#39;t notice when.<br/>

What has worked for us is conversations about how it hurts our feelings when <br/>
J isn&#39;t nice to us. We try to be nice to him as much as possible, and it <br/>
matters that he treat us well too. We can always follow up in the heat of the <br/>
moment with just a quiet &quot;I would really like you to speak to me in a kinder <br/>
way.&quot; <br/>
A lot of the time he isn&#39;t even aware of it, and it&#39;s generally followed by a <br/>
very quick apology.  You do get to be treated kindly, too. If she NEEDS to <br/>
say <br/>
&quot;I KNOW!&quot; and not listen to your suggestion, then at least you don&#39;t get <br/>
dumped on. (And being kind to you includes not blaming you if the projects <br/>
don&#39;t <br/>
work out.)<br/>
<br/>
As far her ignoring your suggestions -- Well...I guess that&#39;s those logical <br/>
consequences we&#39;ve all heard so much about!<br/>
<br/>
I suppose if she keeps blaming you, you could have her sign a contract that <br/>
acknowledges that she KNOWS, and that results, positive and negative are her <br/>
own responsibility. LOL<br/>
<br/>
But I would mostly stress that she has to be nice to you. It feels awaful <br/>
when our kids are mean to us.<br/>
<br/>
Kathryn<br/>
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t even thinking about those natural consequences! It really means a <br/>
lot to me, yours, Pam&#39;s and Sandra&#39;s suggestions. I wasn&#39;t a nice mom when Moly <br/>
was little(er) and I resolved I would change and be a better mom, wife, <br/>
person, and I did spank Jack once too, after that resolution, and felt so horrible <br/>
about that I flogged myself over it. I am one of those people who have to make <br/>
a conscious effort to keep my mouth shut, sit on my hands, all those things <br/>
when I get mad. I have to talk to myself, remind myself that I don&#39;t want to be <br/>
treated badly, no one else does either. And when I am angry; the day is going <br/>
badly, I&#39;m stressed, whatever, I have to make myself think about what it is <br/>
exactly that I am stressed over and who&#39;s fault is it I am feeling that way? <br/>
Usually mine. But when Moly is fussing at me for one thing or another and I try <br/>
to help her and then I get the attitude, the *I know* and the eye rolls it just <br/>
makes me think if all the things I have done are for naught, and if my <br/>
conscientious decisions to be a better person are just biting me in the butt. Then I <br/>
have to remind myself that it isn&#39;t all about me or what I want, and maybe <br/>
she is just trying to tell me something and she doesn&#39;t know how or what words <br/>
to use. My Mom reminded me that Moly didn&#39;t just pick this up on her own, she <br/>
had to have some model for this behavior. So that means that I have to work on <br/>
my own more too. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have noticed with some moms who change from parenting the way their mom did <br/>
(or whatever their justification was) to a more conscious way, that they <br/>
don&#39;t have a set of responses to replace the old ones.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the wilder unschooled kids I&#39;ve seen have had moms who&#39;ve said <br/>
something almost the same as &quot;I used to hit him and now I don&#39;t, so now I don&#39;t know <br/>
what to do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s within the first year, it&#39;s understandable that the kid would be <br/>
kinda celebrating his  freedom, but if it&#39;s been longer, maybe the mom&#39;s <br/>
forgetting to establish a new relationship that involves the kind of communication it <br/>
takes to negotiate a rough day.   Easy days are easy.  It&#39;s when someone&#39;s <br/>
wired or frustrated (mom or kid or visitor or whoever) that it gets frazzly.<br/>
<br/>
We could collect suggestions and I could link them to that spanking <br/>
collection I have at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/spanking">http://sandradodd.com/spanking</a><br/>
<br/>
AND...  I&#39;ve put a lefthand column of links on my unschooling page, because <br/>
the rabbit-warren-style website I had gradually developed was becoming <br/>
unmanageable.  Maybe it&#39;s still difficult, but at least people can go to one main page.<br/>
<br/>

  I can definitely relate to this. For the first couple of months after we stopped spanking there was chaos! It was a little scary. I felt at a complete loss most of the time and wondered if it was going to work. I found heaps of great stuff through Sandra&#39;s site, printed it off and stuck it everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
  Things are good now, we have worked hard to find new ways to deal with situations. It&#39;s harder at first because you have to learn to control yourself rather than the kids but it gets easier to be nice! And it does rub off onto the kids eventually.<br/>

<br/>
I love John Holt&#39;s ideas. But they are confusing me a little bit when I try to apply them to myself. I would like to approach learning in a more Holtian way. I&#39;ve been wanting to learn Tibetan, but all the books I can find are the same old broken down old-fashioned methods. So I tell myself I should get Tibetan kids&#39; books, try to find native Tibetan things, etc. But then I get a litte annoyed at myself because the very idea &quot;I would like to learn Tibetan&quot; seems to be an artificial thing which would never occur to a person learning naturally. Any hints on this, observations, anecdotes, anything you can say about it most welcome! Thanks,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Most large cities have a large immigrant community.  Maybe there are <br/>
Tibetan refugees in your area who would be willing to come for a meal and <br/>
conversation in Tibetan. It would be quite stilted at first, until you <br/>
learned some of the language, but immersion is really the best way to learn <br/>
a language. Possibly you could even find Tibetan videos to immerse yourself <br/>
in. Hearing the language for a long time, just learning to hear and <br/>
recognize the sounds of the language is how babies learn to talk.<br/>

I think any way you approach learning, as long is it comes from a genuine desire within yourself, is &quot;Holtian.&quot;  Even the same broken down, old-fashioned methods can help you to learn as long as you&#39;re responding to a genuine desire for knowledge.  To me, the method is less important than the reason for learning.  If you&#39;re learning because you feel an obligation to accumulate languages or to please someone else, then that&#39;s something you&#39;re forcing on yourself.  But if something within you is just leaning in that direction, then I say follow that instinct until it doesn&#39;t feel right anymore.<br/>

  Hi,<br/>
<br/>
  I love John Holt&#39;s ideas. But they are confusing me a little bit when I try to apply them to myself. I would like to approach learning in a more Holtian way. I&#39;ve been wanting to learn Tibetan, but all the books I can find are the same old broken down old-fashioned methods. So I tell myself I should get Tibetan kids&#39; books, try to find native Tibetan things, etc. But then I get a litte annoyed at myself because the very idea &quot;I would like to learn Tibetan&quot; seems to be an artificial thing which would never occur to a person learning naturally. Any hints on this, observations, anecdotes, anything you can say about it most welcome! Thanks,<br/>
