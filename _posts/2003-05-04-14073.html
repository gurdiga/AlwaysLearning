 It hasn&#39;t really been all that long in the scheme of things since almost<br/>
 *all* women were having sexual intercourse before age 18.  Most women<br/>
 through the ages married soon after puberty, didn&#39;t they? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why I said it wasn&#39;t very conclusive! Young women were commonly <br/>
married at age 14 in days of yore.<br/>
I doubt that age has as much to do with it as they might try to make it sound.<br/>
And I didn&#39;t see any studies that were linking diet to cervical cancer <br/>
(although I&#39;m sure they exist), which has GOT to play a significant role I <br/>
would think.<br/>

<br/>
Since nobody&#39;s insides can count, maybe &quot;multiple partners&quot; is more of an <br/>
odds thing than not.  Like multiple lottery tickets might theoretically make <br/>
it easier to win.   <br/>
<br/>
But IF it comes off or from a guy in ANY way, why couldn&#39;t it come from one?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-526405453">Good point.  Not that it&#39;s the number of partners, but that you are more likely to encounter the wrong one if there are more of them.<br/>

<br/>
There are different risk factors for diseases based on where someone&#39;s<br/>
ancestors came from which suggests slightly different chemistries. No reason<br/>
there can&#39;t be slight variations in the chemistry of bodily fluids.<br/>

More partners, more chance that one of them has something to pass on?<br/>

<br/>
Right.<br/>
<br/>
But that would be like saying having sex frequently is what causes babies.  <br/>
It only takes once.  Someone TRYING to have one might want to up the <br/>
frequency. <br/>
<br/>
Sex with multiple pratners is more likely to produce a pregnancy where the <br/>
father isn&#39;t known with certainty.  My mother proved that with the <br/>
half-brother she produced when I was 19 and smarter than she was about birth <br/>
control.<br/>

<br/>
It can.<br/>
I&#39;m sure we&#39;ve all heard stories of someone getting HIV virus from only one <br/>
sexual encounter.<br/>
 BUT, the reason it raised the risk for other cervical problems, including <br/>
cancer risk is that the body is trying to deal with too many people&#39;s <br/>
differnet virus/bacteria.<br/>
Where it could adapt to one person, it can&#39;t to so many different ones.<br/>
That&#39;s just a theory though.<br/>
It IS considered a true risk factor to have multiple partners (although if <br/>
you look at the studies, what they call multiple are fairly high numbers) but <br/>
beyond that, I don&#39;t think there is anything considered absolutely conclusive.<br/>
