Rubeus Hagrid <br/>
Gamekeeper and Keeper of the Keys at Hogwarts, in the fall of 1993 he also <br/>
became the Care of Magical Creatures teacher.Â <br/>
 <br/>
Hagrid is half giant and he stands almost twice as tall as a normal man. He <br/>
is excessively fond of creatures which he would call cuddly pets and anyone <br/>
else would call fearsome monsters. Hagrid&#39;s appearance is very intimidating, <br/>
but his disposition is kind. <br/>
<br/>
Hagrid attended Hogwarts, starting in 1940. When he was a student there, he <br/>
was falsely accused by Tom Riddle of opening the Chamber of Secrets and <br/>
releasing a monster. Hagrid was expelled. Albus Dumbledore, then the <br/>
Transfiguration Teacher at Hogwarts, arranged for him to stay on as <br/>
gamekeeper. In 1993, his name was cleared through the efforts of Harry Potter <br/>
and his friends. <br/>
<br/>
Hagrid was not allowed to do magic before his name was cleared, although it <br/>
seems that his broken wand was somehow imbedded in his pink umbrella and he <br/>
did cast a spell or two. Now he is allowed to do magic, but as he was never <br/>
properly trained, he&#39;ll always be somewhat inept at it (SN). <br/>

 </span></blockquote>How could I have forgotten the Lexicon!?<br/>
<br/>
We used it exhaustively for our Hogwarts party.  It came in very handy for<br/>
parents who were participating but hadn&#39;t yet read the books, or who had<br/>
read them so long ago they could no longer recall the details.  Or ones who<br/>
didn&#39;t have the book on tape version playing in the background every minute<br/>
of every day so that the details were BURNED INTO THEIR BRAINS. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s an amazing work on the part of someone who will probably never see a<br/>
dime for it.  I believe it grew out of the HP4GU (Harry Potter for Grown<br/>
Ups) group at yahoo.  I was subscribed for quite a while, but it makes this<br/>
group look mute and there was no way I could keep up with the traffic.  It&#39;s<br/>
since grown several side lists, including one for people who want to travel<br/>
to England together to tour HP sites.<br/>
<br/>
I was proud to make a teeny tiny contribution to the Lexicon - I downloaded<br/>
my word of the day several months ago, and lo and behold - there was the<br/>
definition for &quot;Shunpike&quot;.  I sent it in to Steve and he thanked me very<br/>
nicely and put it up on the page about the Knight Bus.<br/>
