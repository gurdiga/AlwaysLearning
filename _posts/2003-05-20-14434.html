&gt; You&#39;ll get to see our new house that we are buying. The deal closes this<br/>
&gt; Wednesday and then it&#39;s ours. We&#39;re moving in this weekend!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We&#39;re going to be living in a round, earth-sheltered, two-story, basement<br/>
&gt; home. Yep, that means there&#39;s dirt on the roof!<br/>
&gt; There are hardly any vertical walls - most&#39;ve&#39;m are curved because the <br/>
&gt; house<br/>
&gt; really is completely round. It&#39;s cool! I hope we like living there - it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; really different and unique.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>SO COOL! Bring photos in August---or post them here! so we all can see.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am definitely registering any day now - before June 1 for SURE.<br/>
&gt; I already bought tickets to fly there - except we are flying into <br/>
&gt; Charlotte,<br/>
&gt; NC and driving down to Columbia for the conference. With our family of <br/>
&gt; four,<br/>
&gt; I was able to save about $600 (total) doing it that way - tickets to<br/>
&gt; Charlotte are a lot more reasonably priced. I got a good deal on Hotwire. <br/>
&gt; So<br/>
&gt; anyway, we&#39;re going! Woohoo!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; See ya in a few months &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t wait!<br/>
<br/>
I guess most of you know that I put on the conference last year for totally <br/>
selfish reasons---because I wanted to meet all of you. It worked! &lt;BWG&gt; And <br/>
this year I get to meet even more! I&#39;m glad we have a bigger hotel, &#39;cause <br/>
we&#39;re going to need it!<br/>
<br/>
To have our online friendships is pretty neat, but to actually MEET you guys <br/>
IRL is truly amazing!<br/>
<br/>
~Kelly, the selfish---and proud of it! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

    Congratulations that sounds so cool! With it being round how do you hang<br/>
pictures? Boy does that sound silly. Oh well won&#39;t know unless I ask.<br/>
