<div id="ygrps-yiv-1500042285">Dylan got to tour the local lumber mill, the local superfund cleanup site<br/>
and climb around on a locomotive all because we just showed up smiling<br/>
and eager and asked.  I think if we&#39;d tried to plan ahead and call and<br/>
arrange we might have been shot down because they would have had time to<br/>
worry about injury and liability.  So I&#39;m a firm believer in the stop<br/>
while your out driving around method.  <br/>
<br/>
Also,  the homeschool groups around here organize ski trips.  It&#39;s really<br/>
reasonable and the beginners get lessons.  You go all day, four or six<br/>
times a season, or whatever, rent the equipment and it&#39;s usually during<br/>
the middle of the week when the slopes aren&#39;t that busy.  <br/>
<br/>
If they like skiing but the cost is too much try cross country.  You<br/>
don&#39;t have to know anything just be willing to learn and fall a lot.  We<br/>
used to rent ski&#39;s but after a while we found some second hand.  We&#39;ve<br/>
been using the same skis for twelve years and we&#39;re still having fun.  <br/>
Lots of towns groom their bike trails in the winter for cross country, so<br/>
you might not even have to make a trip out of town.  If you do live where<br/>
they groom trails there&#39;s probably a ski club and you could maybe find<br/>
someone to get you started.<br/>
<br/>
I hear from my nephew that learning to snow board is easier than learning<br/>
to ski.  <br/>
