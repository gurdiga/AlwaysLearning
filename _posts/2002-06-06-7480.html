<div id="ygrps-yiv-1989385987">This morning my dd and I joinned the school activity at the pound<br/>
of our nearby park.  This is the second activity that dd joinned<br/>
since the school year began in April.  The first activity she<br/>
joinned was the field trip.<br/>
<br/>
She is 7 yo and is listed as a student at the ps designated by<br/>
the ward.  Here in Japan all children are authomatically listed<br/>
in one of the ps nearest his/her home. The principal knows that<br/>
we are homeschooling and has openned the school for us.  We are<br/>
to come and go as we wish.  The vice principal and dd class<br/>
teacher even told us to &quot;utilize&quot; the school as best fit to our<br/>
needs.<br/>
<br/>
As they keep us informed of the activities, dd chose to join the<br/>
activity today.<br/>
<br/>
We, as parents, feels that this is  a good arrangement.  There is<br/>
no other hs around. Since we are open to the school and the<br/>
school to us we have been in peace with them.  dd has been<br/>
playing daily with her &quot;school mates&quot;. Little by little dd is<br/>
getting courageous and expressing her education choice.  Little<br/>
by little the children in our neiborhood are learning to respect<br/>
our choice.  When I tell them that Aya learns at home, at park,<br/>
at museums, at libraries ...etc, they all get envious.<br/>
<br/>
I wished she read more and wrote more.  She is too busy playing<br/>
outside, and while inside home she is too busy drawing.  Learning<br/>
to write Japanese, the 5000 plus ideograms, is as much the same<br/>
as learning to writing English.  Children do it naturally when<br/>
the right time/needs come.  I once doubted that, until I saw a<br/>
Japanese unschooled 8 yo.<br/>
.......<br/>
Cleanning up.<br/>
<br/>
I am having a hard time at home.  Books, papers, pencil,<br/>
magazines and toys are everywhere. I keep reminding me of when dd<br/>
was hospitalized and our 36 m. square place was clean and well<br/>
organized, I should be grateful that dd is very active...<br/>
<br/>
I know that.  That is, my brain knows that but my mouth screams.<br/>
How much cleanning up after a child mess do you allow?<br/>
<br/>
I try not to tell dd to put back all little objects she takes<br/>
out.  I have told her know how much I appreciate clean places and<br/>
that I do not like messes and how much messes irritates me.  I<br/>
have places designated for most of the objects and toys and<br/>
books. She has her own places that she can keep as she wants, but<br/>
we have to share all of the 36 m square we live in...<br/>

around us is as usual.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Have her help pick up; make a game of it.  My son and I used to race to see<br/>
who could pick up the legos fastest and who could make the loudest sound<br/>
dropping them into the bucket!  Make a routine of picking up everything<br/>
several times a day: before going to the park, before lunch, before dinner,<br/>
before bedtime, for instance.  Help her learn to put away what she takes<br/>
out.  I try to not insist on only one activity out at a time, because my<br/>
kids might be combining stuff: the timer from one game, the cards from<br/>
another, drawing materials for creating a whole new game; to me, it might<br/>
just look like a giganitic mess, but it&#39;s not to them.  My kids are older<br/>
now (12 and 14) and their stuff is more compact (how much room do 20 game<br/>
cartridges take, after all?); our clean-up is usually before dad gets home,<br/>
and before bed.  These are good life skills to have; its a way of showing<br/>
respect to the other people you live with, whether they&#39;re parents, spouses<br/>
or roommates.<br/>

of play with you.  Don&#39;t leave her alone with orders to clean up, and don&#39;t<br/>
make cleaning a punishment; I think that&#39;s why so many women have trouble<br/>
keeping their homes clean.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2029644784">Dear Noemi,<br/>
<br/>
I know how hard it is to keep a small home tidy.  Our house is very small<br/>
and can look messy if one thing is out of place.  ( And it always looks<br/>
messy! )<br/>
<br/>
But when you&#39;re old and Aya is grown and living her own life away from<br/>
you, and when you look back on your life, knowing your home was always<br/>
clean won&#39;t bring you any happiness.  Knowing Aya was free to play and<br/>
learn and grow will be the thing that makes you smile.    When she is<br/>
grown you&#39;ll have all the time in the world to keep your home looking<br/>
nice.  Right now is the only time your sweet daughter has to be a happy<br/>
child.  <br/>
<br/>
Love & Peace,<br/>

she&#39;ll be too old! So whatever it is that kids get out of the playing they<br/>
do as children, they need to do it now or it will be too late. She has the<br/>
rest of her life to read and write. She only has now to play.<br/>
