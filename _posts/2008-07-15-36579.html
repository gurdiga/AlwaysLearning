<div id="ygrps-yiv-1053682462">Hey everybody,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always thought that sites like Myspace are neat but too gargantuan, <br/>
and I went ahead and built a site, an online community for unschoolers: <br/>
www.unschoold.com<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a place to blog, engage in unschooling discussions and connect with <br/>
others.  Currently, members can create groups and organize meetups.  <br/>
I&#39;ve been kicking around the idea of chatrooms, classified ads (how cool <br/>
would it be to support other unschoolers!) and more.  My dreams are only <br/>
limited by my time :-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to invite everyone to join community and shape its future.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>
<br/>
Arp<br/>
