<br/>
Here is one of my favorite quotes:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;There is no such thing as an uninteresting life.  Beneath the dullest exterior exterior there is a drama, a comedy, a tragedy.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2016972065">Here&#39;s my quote file:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;And what is a good citizen? Simply one who never says, does or thinks<br/>
anything that is unusual. Schools are maintained in order to bring this<br/>
uniformity up to the highest possible point. A school is a hopper into which<br/>
children are heaved while they are still young and tender; therein they are<br/>
pressed into certain standard shapes and covered from head to heels with<br/>
official rubber-stamps.&quot; -- H.L. Mencken<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;Compulsory government schooling began in the US in 1852 in<br/>
Massachusetts.[1] At that time, it took guns, soldiers and the threat of<br/>
bloody violence, rather than expert advice, to force parents to submit to<br/>
giving up their children.&quot;  --  Cathy Cuthbert (homeschool mother and editor<br/>
of The School Liberator, published by the Alliance for the Separation of<br/>
School & State.)  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sepschool.org/essays/cuthbert/empire.html">http://www.sepschool.org/essays/cuthbert/empire.html</a><br/>
%<br/>
&quot;Education is a private matter between the person and the world of knowledge<br/>
and experience, and has little to do with school or college.&quot;   - Lillian<br/>
Smith<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;Forced schooling arose from the new logic of the Industrial Age -- the<br/>
logic imposed on flesh and blood by fossil fuel and high-speed machinery.<br/>
This simple reality is hidden from view by early philosophical and<br/>
theological anticipations of mass schooling in various writings about social<br/>
order and human nature. But you shouldn&#39;t be fooled any more than Charles<br/>
Francis Adams was fooled when he observed in 1880 that what was being cooked<br/>
up for kids unlucky enough to be snared by the newly proposed institutional<br/>
school net combined characteristics of the cotton mill and the railroad with<br/>
those of a state prison.&quot;  --John Taylor Gatto in The Underground History of<br/>
American Education.<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;I suppose it is because nearly all children go to school nowadays, and have<br/>
things arranged for them, that they seem so forlornly unable to produce<br/>
their own ideas.&quot;  --  Agatha Christie<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;If parents of students have the right to choose so many other basics in<br/>
their lives-such as where they live, where they go to church, where they<br/>
work-then they also ought have the right to choose where their children go<br/>
to school.&quot;<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;It is inappropriate for (parents) to design the curriculum and to run the<br/>
school.&quot;<br/>
 --  Rod Paige, George W. Bush&#39;s Education Secretary, September 2001<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s (education) a partnership. The parent has responsibility, too.  Make<br/>
sure a disciplined child shows up who wants to learn. It is inappropriate<br/>
[for parents] to design the curriculum and to run the school.&quot;  --U.S.<br/>
Education Secretary Rod Paige, as quoted in the<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;My grandmother wanted me to have an education so she kept me out of<br/>
school.&quot; -- Margaret Mead<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;Only a government school bureaucracy could wonder what is wrong with young<br/>
children who prefer to move around, talk, and learn what they want to learn<br/>
rather than sit quietly and listen to an adult droning on.&quot;  --<br/>

%<br/>
&quot;Our schools have been scientifically designed to prevent over-education<br/>
from happening...The average American [should be] content with their humble<br/>
role in life, because they&#39;re not tempted to think about any other role.&quot; -<br/>
William Harris, U.S. Commissioner of Education, 1889<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;Parent&#39;s attitudes about what they want for their children represent one of<br/>
the greatest barriers to successful implementation of school-to-work.&quot;  --<br/>
U.S. Department of Education&#39;s Office of Educational Research and<br/>
Improvement<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;Schools create the present world in a bizarre take on Rousseau: man is<br/>
everywhere born naked and free, and now is everywhere, not in chains, but<br/>
diapers.&quot; -- from Home Schooled and Free by Michael Gilson De Lemos<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/delemos/delemos16.html">http://www.lewrockwell.com/delemos/delemos16.html</a>&gt;<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;The best hope for rejection of the American Empire and a resurgence of a<br/>
love of liberty is homeschooling.&quot; -- Cathy Cuthbert (homeschool mother and<br/>
editor of The School Liberator, published by the Alliance for the Separation<br/>
of School & State.)<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;The big problem in the long process of dumbing down the schools is that you<br/>
can reach a point of no return. How are parents who never received a decent<br/>
education themselves to recognize that their children are not getting a<br/>
decent education?&quot;   --  Thomas Sowell<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;The code of the schoolyard, Marge! The rules that teach a boy to be a man.<br/>
Let&#39;s see. Don&#39;t tattle. Always make fun of those different from you. Never<br/>
say anything, unless you&#39;re sure everyone feels exactly the same way you<br/>
do.&quot; - Homer Simpson<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;The first goal and primary function of the U.S. public school is not to<br/>
educate good people, but good citizens. It is the function which we call in<br/>
enemy nations &#39;state indoctrination&#39;.&quot; --  Jonathan Kozol 1990<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;The only time my education was interrupted was when I was in school.&quot;   --<br/>
George Bernard Shaw<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;there ain&#39;t no rules around here! We&#39;re tryin&#39; to accomplish somep&#39;n.&quot; --<br/>
Thomas Edison, homeschooler<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;There is nothing on earth intended for innocent people so horrible as a<br/>
school. To begin with, it is a prison. But it is in some respects more cruel<br/>
than a prison. In a prison, for instance, you are not forced to read books<br/>
written by the warden and the governor ... In prison they may torture your<br/>
body; but they do not torture your brains.&quot;  --  George Bernard Shaw,<br/>
playwright<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;They say that we are better educated than our parents&#39; generation. What<br/>
they mean is that we go to school longer. They are not the same thing.&quot;  --<br/>
Douglas Yates<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;When one is convinced of the truth of one&#39;s position, one is glad to engage<br/>
in discourse. One does not ask the opponent to hush.&quot; - Marshall Fritz<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sepschool.org/Edlib/v2n8/hush.html">http://sepschool.org/Edlib/v2n8/hush.html</a><br/>
%<br/>
&quot;When school children start paying union dues, that&#39;s when I&#39;ll start<br/>
representing the interests of school children.&quot; -- Albert Shanker, longtime<br/>
American Federation of Teachers president<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;Whenever the teacher said, &#39;If you don&#39;t get good grades, you won&#39;t do well<br/>
in the real world,&#39; Mike and I just raised our eyebrows. When we were told<br/>
to follow set procedures and not deviate from the rules, we could see how<br/>
the schooling process actually discouraged creativity. We started to<br/>
understand why our rich dad told us that schools were designed to produce<br/>
good employees instead of employers.&quot;  --  Robert Kiyosaki, &quot;Rich Dad, Poor<br/>
Dad.&quot;<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;You are not paying for education twice if you send your child to a private<br/>
school. You are paying once for the government indoctrination of other<br/>
people&#39;s children and once for the education of yours. You are not paying<br/>
for education when you pay taxes.&quot;  -- Marshall Fritz, President, The<br/>
Alliance for the Separation of School and State<br/>
%<br/>
[Schools:] vast factories for the manufacture of robots. -- Robert Lindner<br/>
(1914-1956)<br/>
%<br/>
Education - compulsory schooling, compulsory learning - is a tyranny and a<br/>
crime against the human mind and spirit. Let all those escape it who can,<br/>
any way they can. - John Holt<br/>
%<br/>
Education is not the filling of a bucket but the lighting of a fire --<br/>
William Butler Yeats<br/>
%<br/>
Education is an admirable thing, but it is well to remember from time to<br/>
time that nothing that is worth knowing can be taught. - Oscar Wilde,<br/>
1856-1900<br/>
%<br/>
Every year when it was time for Charlie Brown to kick the football, a nation<br/>
ached for him to say at last &quot;Not this time, Lucy.&quot; Until we re-examine our<br/>
underlying premise of who is responsible for a child&#39;s education - parents<br/>
or government - we will continue playing Charlie Brown to a Bush or a<br/>
Clinton, trusting that &quot;this time&quot; their five-year plan will work. -<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sepschool.org">http://www.sepschool.org</a><br/>
%<br/>
I am convinced that the battle for humankind&#39;s future must be waged and won<br/>
in the public school classroom by teachers who correctly view their role as<br/>
the proselytizers of a new faith. The classroom must and will become an<br/>
arena of conflict between the old and the new; the rotting corpse of<br/>
Christianity, together with all its adjacent evils and misery, and the new<br/>
faith of Humanism. -- The Official Journal of the American Humanist<br/>
Association [1983]<br/>
%<br/>
If your food at the restaurant is rancid and you have to send it back and<br/>
the waiter offers you more of the same for more money, would you take it?<br/>
No? Then why are we putting more money into public schools?<br/>
%<br/>
In volume two of his work, &quot;The Enlightenment,&quot; Peter Gay, writing of the<br/>
18th century, noted:   &quot;The kindly spirits that sent the children of the<br/>
poor to the charity schools in England, for example, had no intention of<br/>
permitting these pupils to rise above their station: the point of this<br/>
schooling was to produce piety and insure deference; when some attempt was<br/>
made to teach the most intelligent of these children something more than<br/>
reading, petty tradesmen objected to this potential competition with their<br/>
own children.&quot;<br/>

%<br/>
LET&#39;S MAKE NO MISTAKE about it. Tax-funded schools are welfare, pure and<br/>
simple. If a free lunch at noon is welfare, so is a free math lesson at ten<br/>
a.m.  --  Marshall Fritz<br/>
 <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sepschool.org/edlib/v3n4/violated.html">http://www.sepschool.org/edlib/v3n4/violated.html</a><br/>
%<br/>
Nine out of 10 parents were publicly schooled. If they are unfit as adults<br/>
to direct the education of their own children, then public schooling should<br/>
hang its collective head and change its ways - not cement its collective<br/>
failures into the constitution. -- J.J. Ross, Ed.D.<br/>
%<br/>
One of the misuses of the words &quot;schooling&quot; and &quot;education&quot; is the common<br/>
reference to &quot;compulsory education.&quot; That is a misnomer if there ever was<br/>
one. There are no compulsory education laws--laws which require that all<br/>
children be educated. As is commonly known, huge numbers are not educated to<br/>
any minimum level, including many who graduate from high school.  -- David<br/>
Kirkpatrick in his column &quot;More on Compulsory Schooling.&quot;<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.schoolreformers.com/editorials/2001/compulsion2.html">http://www.schoolreformers.com/editorials/2001/compulsion2.html</a><br/>
%<br/>
The public school system: &quot;Usually a twelve year sentence of mind control.<br/>
Crushing creativity, smashing individualism, encouraging collectivism and<br/>
compromise, destroying the exercise of intellectual inquiry, twisting it<br/>
instead into meek subservience to authority.&quot; - Walter Karp, Editor Harper&#39;s<br/>
Magazine<br/>
%<br/>
My children are too smart to allow school to keep them from learning about<br/>
the world and all that it offers!<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;I am beginning to suspect all elaborate and special systems of education.<br/>
They seem to me to be built upon the supposition that every child is a kind<br/>
of idiot who must taught to think. Whereas if the child is left to himself,<br/>
he will think more and better, if less slowly. Let him come and go freely,<br/>
let him touch real things and combine his impressions for himself, instead<br/>
of sitting indoors at a little round table while a sweet-voiced teacher<br/>
suggest that he build a stone wall with his wooden blocks, or make a rainbow<br/>
out of strips of colored paper, or plant straw trees in flower pots. Such<br/>
teaching fills the mind with artificial associations that must be got rid of<br/>
before the child can develop independent ideas out of actual experiences.<br/>
&quot; -- Anne Sullivan, Helen Keller&#39;s mentor and friend<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;Education is an admirable thing, but it is well to remember from time to<br/>
time that nothing that is worth knowing can be taught.&quot; - Oscar Wilde<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;American parents have surrendered their responsibility for the education of<br/>
their children to government -- and increasingly to the Imperial Federal<br/>
Government. The results aren&#39;t good.&quot; --Neil Boortz<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;A tax supported, compulsory educational system is the complete model of the<br/>
totalitarian state.&quot; -- Isabel Patterson, The God of the Machine<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;If the only motive was to help people who could not afford education,<br/>
advocates of government involvement would have simply proposed tuition<br/>
subsidies.&quot;  -  Milton Friedman<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;Teachers are directed to instruct their pupils... and to awaken in them a<br/>
sense of their responsibility toward the community of the<br/>
nation.&quot; --Bernhard Rust, Nazi Minister of Education; from &quot;Racial<br/>
Instruction and the National Community,&quot; 1935.<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;Let our pupil be taught that he does not belong to himself, but that he is<br/>
public property ... He must be taught to amass wealth, but it must be only<br/>
to increase his power of contributing to the wants and demands of the<br/>
state...  [Education] can be done effectually only by the interference and<br/>
aid of the Legislature.&quot; -- Benjamin Rush, 1786<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;Men had better be without education than be educated by their rulers.&quot; --<br/>
Thomas Hodgskin<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;State education is a mere contrivance for molding people to be exactly<br/>
alike one another.&quot; --  John Stuart Mill 1859<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;The aim of education is not to spread enlightenment at all; it is simply to<br/>
reduce as many individuals as possible to the same safe level, to breed a<br/>
standard citizenry, to put down dissent and originality. --  H.L. Menken<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;The last stand of oligarchical and anti-social seclusion is perpetuation of<br/>
this purely individualistic notion of intelligence.&quot; - Socialist John Dewey,<br/>
Founder of Modern Education<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;We don&#39;t need no education.  We don&#39;t need no thought control.  No dark<br/>
sarcasm in the classroom.  Teacher leave them kids alone.&quot; -- Pink Floyd<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;Whenever is found what is called a paternal government, there is found<br/>
state education.  It has been discovered that the best way to ensure<br/>
implicit obedience is to commence tyranny in the nursery.&quot; -- Benjamin<br/>
Disraeli, 1874<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;It is a miracle that curiousity survives formal education.&quot; --  Albert<br/>
Einstein<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;Self-education is, I firmly believe, the only kind of education there<br/>
is.&quot; -- Isaac Asimov<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;First and foremost, we&#39;re running a public system at taxpayer&#39;s expense for<br/>
the public good and only secondarily for the good of parents and<br/>
individuals.&quot;  -- American Federation of Teachers president Al Shanker<br/>
%<br/>
As one very troubled teacher recently put it, &quot;We send our tax money to<br/>
Washington, then Washington feeds it back to us only if we do what we&#39;re<br/>
told.  Something is wrong here.&quot;<br/>
%<br/>
I go to school, but I never learn what I want to know. - Calvin (The<br/>
Authoritative Calvin and Hobbes, p235-2)<br/>
%<br/>
This morning I had a wonderful dream. By holding my arms out stiff and<br/>
pushing down hard, I found I could suspend myself a few feet above ground. I<br/>
flapped harder, and soon I was soaring effortlessly over the trees and<br/>
telephone poles! I could fly! I folded my arms back and zoomed low over the<br/>
neighborhood. Everyone was amazed, and they ran along under me as I shot by.<br/>
Then I rocketed up so fast that my eyes watered from the wind. I laughed and<br/>
laughed, making huge loops in the sky! ...That&#39;s when Mom woke me up and<br/>
said I was going to miss the bus if I didn&#39;t get my bottom out of bed; 20<br/>
minutes later, here I am, standing in the cold rain, waiting to go to<br/>
school, and I just remembered I forgot my lunch. Tuesdays don&#39;t start much<br/>
worse than this.  --  Calvin (The Indispensable Calvin and Hobbes, p207-2)<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;The bottom line is this, always this. We have no more freedom, no more<br/>
rights, than the most restricted among us.&quot; - Cathy D. Henderson<br/>

%<br/>
&quot;I like the Montessori method.  It teaches through play. It makes learning a<br/>
pleasure. It follows the natural instincts of the human being . . . The<br/>
present system casts the brain into a mold. It does not encourage original<br/>
thought or reasoning.&quot; - Thomas Edison, homeschooler<br/>
%<br/>
It&#39;s better to be slightly concerned about socialization than very concerned<br/>
about socialism.<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;If a man empties his purse into his head, no man can take it away from him.<br/>
An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest.&quot;  --Benjamin<br/>
Franklin<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;The right to freedom in the area of intellectual development and personal<br/>
philosophy is fully as important as freedom of religion. Thus there should<br/>
be a separation of education and state just as there is a separation of<br/>
church and state.&quot;  -  David Berglund, 1984 Libertarian candidate for<br/>
President<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;Christ didn&#39;t set up the Judea Compulsory School System. He issued an<br/>
invitation, &quot;Follow me,&quot; and some did, and some didn&#39;t. And Christ didn&#39;t<br/>

&quot;Men are born ignorant, not stupid; they are made stupid by education.&quot; -<br/>

habitually subservient.&quot; - Chris Shute<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;Let a child suddenly become interested in pursuing a subject that strikes<br/>
his or her fancy, and a teacher should be able to seize that opportunity....<br/>
Instead, the bell rings, and the little inmates are expected to turn off<br/>
that spark of curiosity that fires constantly in six-year-olds, but which is<br/>
progressively extinguished by a 19th century factory model of education that<br/>
only considers such outbursts inconvenient, as they shuffle off to their<br/>
next planned activity like spiritless drones.&quot; - Vin Suprynowicz<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;It is the duty of a citizen in a free country not to fit into society, but<br/>
to make society.&quot; -John Holt<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;No teaching is equal, more spiritually rewarding, or more exalting than<br/>
that of a mother teaching her children.&quot; --  Boyd K. Packer<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;A custodial parent has a constitutional right to determine, without undue<br/>
influence from the state, how best to raise, nurture, and educate the<br/>
child.&quot;<br/>
US Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;it cannot now be doubted that the due process clause of the 14th Amendment<br/>
protects the fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the<br/>
care, custody, and control of their children.&quot;<br/>
US Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O&#39;Connor<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;In my view, a right of parents to direct the upbringing of their children<br/>
is among the &quot;unalienable Rights&quot; with which the Declaration of Independence<br/>
proclaims &quot;all Men ... are endowed by their Creator.&quot; And in my view that<br/>
right is also among the &quot;othe[r] [rights] retained by the people&quot; which the<br/>
Ninth Amendment says the Constitution&#39;s enumeration of rights &quot;shall not be<br/>
construed to deny or disparage.&quot; -- Justice Antonin Scalia<br/>

&quot;When we started homeschooling,<br/>
I felt as though I had tucked a child under each arm and jumped off a cliff.<br/>
Imagine my surprise to discover we have wings.&quot;<br/>
~Maura Seger<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;The secret of the superiority of state over private education lies in the<br/>
fact that in the former the teacher is responsible to society... [T]he<br/>
result desired by the state is a wholly different one from that desired by<br/>
parents, guardians, and pupils.&quot; - Lester Frank Ward (1897)<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;The first duty of a State is to see that every child born therein shall be<br/>
well housed, clothed, fed, and educated, till it attain years of discretion.<br/>
But in order to the effecting this the Government must have an authority<br/>
over the people of which we now do not so much as dream.&quot; - John Ruskin<br/>
(d1900)<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;Our schools are, in a sense, factories, in which the raw products<br/>
(children) are to be shaped and fashioned into products to meet the various<br/>
demands of life. The specifications for manufacturing come from the demands<br/>
of twentieth-century civilization, and it is the business of the school to<br/>
build its pupils according to the specifications laid down.&quot; - Elwood<br/>
Cubberley (1920)<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;What is the task of higher education? To make a man into a machine. What<br/>
are the means employed? He is taught how to suffer being bored.&quot; - F. W.<br/>

&quot;The end of public education awaits one thing: Parents with the courage to<br/>
rescue their children.&quot;<br/>
%<br/>
Whatever an education is, it should make you a unique individual, not a<br/>
conformist; it should furnish you with an original spirit with which to<br/>
tackle the big challenges; it should allow you to find values which will be<br/>
your road map through life; it should make you spiritually rich, a person<br/>
who loves whatever you are doing, wherever you are, whomever you are with;<br/>
it should teach you what is important, how to live and how to die. -- From<br/>
Dumbing us Down by John Taylor Gatto<br/>

I don&#39;t trust the government with my money.  Why would I trust them with my<br/>
children?<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;Every child in America entering school at the age of five is mentally ill<br/>
because he comes to school with certain allegiances to our Founding Fathers,<br/>
toward our elected officials, toward his parents, toward a belief in a<br/>
supernatural being, and toward the sovereignty of this nation as a separate<br/>
entity. It&#39;s up to you as teachers to make all these sick children well - by<br/>
creating the international child of the future.&quot; --Professor Chester M.<br/>
Pierce, M.D., Professor of Education and Psychiatry at Harvard<br/>

&quot;Thank goodness I was never sent to school; it would have rubbed off some of<br/>

Your descendants, however, now stand in the new camp. In a short time they<br/>

&quot;Home schooling is a very old way of doing things.  If you look at any of<br/>
the bills in your wallet or the coins in your pocket, they all have a<br/>
picture of a home-schooler on them.&quot; - William Lloyd, National Home<br/>

&quot;Take chances, make mistakes, get messy&quot;~ Miss Frizzle, &#39;The Magic School<br/>
Bus&#39;<br/>
%<br/>
&quot;A good educational system should have three purposes: it should provide all<br/>
who want to learn with access to available resources at anytime in their<br/>
lives; empower all who want to share what they know to find those who want<br/>
to learn it from them; and finally, furnish all who want to present an issue<br/>
to the public with the opportunity to make their challenge known.&quot; - Ivan<br/>
Illich<br/>

&quot;You can follow your book and your map of wars, but I&#39;ll go and follow my<br/>

When people think about supersition and mythology, they often think of far <br/>
away exotic or old-timey things, but the biggest piece of superstitious, <br/>
mythological ju-ju I&#39;ve personally seen in the American mantra, &quot;All men are created <br/>
equal.&quot;  Because in its original context, it made pretty good sense.  But when <br/>
quoted ad nauseum by elementary school teachers, it means &quot;Get off your high <br/>
horse,&quot; and &quot;You&#39;re no better than anyone else,&quot; and &quot;You think you&#39;re so <br/>
smart&quot; and other irritating subtexts.<br/>
<br/>
And people are clearly NOT &quot;created equal,&quot; but it&#39;s rude to say so.<br/>
Politically and socially, there&#39;s a point to be made.  But when a child who <br/>
could run is made to clop along at the pace of the other kids because &quot;we&#39;re <br/>
