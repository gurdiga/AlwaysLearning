<div id="ygrps-yiv-1447560810">I have enjoyed the insight that I have gotten from this group, but I <br/>
think that it is geared toward folks with older kids, so I will be <br/>
trying out some other unschool message boards to see if they better <br/>
meet my needs.  <br/>
IMHO, it feels like there is a general assumption here that if you are <br/>
just starting out you are probably doing it wrong.  It seems like the <br/>
focus is more on what is wrong as opposed to what is right and <br/>
supporting nurturing those things.  <br/>
I am sure I will see many of you at the conference in Sept.  It will <br/>
be fun to put faces and families to names.  <br/>
I really should have spent many more weeks just lurking, but I was <br/>
just too excited to get involved.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>

There are other groups listed here, with one for beginners and one  <br/>
for people with very young children:<br/>
