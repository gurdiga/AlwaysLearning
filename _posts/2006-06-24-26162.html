<div id="ygrps-yiv-1985999468">This week I was on the deck building bird houses  with the three younger <br/>
children. (We are on house number 6 I think. <br/>
<br/>
One  of the day&#39;s Nicholas, 3, said to Cassidy &quot;Oooh, Cassidy watch out that <br/>
bat is  going to eat you&quot; joking around. Cassidy quickly responded without <br/>
looking up  from her painting, &quot;Nicholas bats are nocturnal they don&#39;t fly during <br/>
the day,  silly.. that&#39;s a bird&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
She sounded so grown up. I stood there so jar  dropped at how she sounded. I <br/>
felt so educational-y empty when she said that. I  would never have one known <br/>
that as a child her age or wanted to remember it.  <br/>
