As practice for connection-making and strewing, how about the topic  <br/>
of &quot;walls&quot;?  Go to that link and participate if you wish, by  <br/>
commenting, or you could e-mail me or comment here (there is better,  <br/>
but here&#39;s still here).<br/>
<br/>
And y&#39;know what about connections and strewing?  There&#39;s no  <br/>
&quot;practice,&quot; there&#39;s only the for-real doing.<br/>
