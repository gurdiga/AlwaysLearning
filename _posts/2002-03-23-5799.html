<br/>
Hi Pat,<br/>
<br/>
I have been following your evolution with awe and wonder.  You have made<br/>
massive changes in your life and in the lives of your children in just a few<br/>
months.  Change is tiring for all concerned.  May I suggest giving yourself<br/>
some breathing room?  Just relax and breathe.  Spend some days watching the<br/>
grass grow and the clouds float by.  Let yourself and your kids just &quot;be&quot;<br/>
for awhile.<br/>
<br/>
You need time to incorporate all the changes you&#39;ve made.  It&#39;s like when dh<br/>
can no longer stand the lack of organization in the pantry and puts all the<br/>
snack food on one shelf and all the cereal on another.  Even though it is<br/>
easier to find things eventually, initially it is slightly unnerving because<br/>
things aren&#39;t where they are &quot;supposed&quot; to be.  (I use the jars of horrible<br/>
pickles I made last summer that are still taking up space as a landmark to<br/>
find where I put things.)<br/>
