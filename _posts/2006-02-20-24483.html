<br/>
Thank you so much for such a poignant reminder of that which truly<br/>
matters in this life. You&#39;ve faced a lot of loss for one human<br/>
being....I&#39;m grateful to hear your story.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We are raising children and they are gathering memories of their<br/>
family of<br/>
origin.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is so true.<br/>
I often look at my children in certain moments and remind myself that<br/>
I am shaping their memories to a huge extent. I want those to be<br/>
peaceful and happy memories, as much as possible.<br/>
