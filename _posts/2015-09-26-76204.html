<div id="ygrps-yiv-2167852">New Unschooling resource! Clare Kirkpatrick has set up a site called Unschooling Moments. It&#39;s subtitled &quot;Glimpes of Joy, Connection and Learning in Radical Unschooling Families.&quot; There are some there to read already and a random-page function (for when there are many more). <br/>
<br/>
I really like this project, and am a little sad that my kids are all too old to report on in this way now. :-)  <br/>
<br/>
If you have a photo with a small caption, or a longer story (up to 500 words) with a photo (or several), there is a contact form. Clare will e-mail you to get photos.<br/>
It&#39;s easy to subsribe by mail, there.<br/>
<br/>
I hope lots of you will send stories as they come up!  Even if you have your own blog or outlet, maybe if thereâ€™s something you know would help other families, you might send it to clare, too.<br/>
<br/>
This should be helpful for reassurance, idea-getting, and for showing people who wonder how unschooling works.<br/>
