<div id="ygrps-yiv-1031888866">We are heading off this weekend to celebrate a bunch of celestial<br/>
happenings. First, there is a total lunar eclipse occurring during<br/>
what is being called the Harmonic Concordance, a configuration of<br/>
planets around the ecliptic in a most auspicious arrangement. Then<br/>
we have the huge coronal mass ejections that our sun has been hurling<br/>
about our solar system, making it highly probable that we will see<br/>
the aurora borealis if the skies remain clear.<br/>
<br/>
A bunch of homeschoolers, friends, and family here have arranged to<br/>
visit a beautiful nature preserve called Woodland Altars, run by the<br/>
Church of the Brethren (a Christian organization with a mission of<br/>
Peace). We will take our field glasses and telescopes, musical<br/>
instruments, and stories to tell around the campfire circles Friday<br/>
and Saturday nights. And we have arranged a bunch of other options,<br/>
opportunities, for Saturday.  Some plan to just fish and commune with <br/>
nature, sit around the campfire circles.  Others, like me, plan to <br/>
visit the many great sites in the area.<br/>
<br/>
First we plan to visit Seven Caves, a great natural cave site. For<br/>
this we have been watching the NOVA series on caves, reading<br/>
Plato&#39;s &quot;Allegory of the Cave,&quot; and studying the symbolism of the<br/>
number seven in many spiritual teachings, from Buddhism, to the seven<br/>
chakras. Then we will head over to Great Serpent Mound, the only<br/>
Native American fetish serpent site known, made in the shape of a<br/>
serpent uncoiling in seven deep curves. There&#39;s that number seven<br/>
again! For this visit we have been discussing Native American<br/>
spirituality, the symbolism of the serpent in many different cultural <br/>
traditions, and the history of the Moundbuilders.<br/>
<br/>
And lastly we are visiting the Locust Grove Crop Circle site, which<br/>
is just across the road from Great Serpent Mound. For that we have<br/>
been watching the NOVA series on &quot;String Theory,&quot; studying some basic<br/>
quantum mechanics, discussing favorite science fiction and other <br/>
readings about alternative realities, reading theories about what <br/>
might have caused these different geometrically patterned circles all <br/>
around the globe.<br/>
<br/>
We have also studied about eclipses, read about the Harmonic<br/>
Concordance in science and several spiritual traditions, and studied<br/>
about the intense solar activity going on including the aurora<br/>
borealis. Wow! What a weekend. Each night we will have campfire<br/>
circles for music and storytelling. We will set up our telescopes<br/>
and observe the eclipse, hope to observe the aurora borealis, all in<br/>
a tranquil and beautiful setting at Woodland Altars.<br/>
<br/>
Interested home educators from all over the state, with friends and<br/>
family, will gather for this weekend. Some of us are staying in nice<br/>
warm chalets we have rented. Others will bring their RVs. The very<br/>
brave will camp out. Brrrrrrrrr! Even though last week we saw<br/>
record setting high temperatures here, this weekend the temperature<br/>
has fallen like a rock and it is supposed to be crystal clear, great<br/>
for nighttime viewing, but very cold!<br/>
<br/>
We are all looking forward to this celebration together where we will<br/>
share learning experiences, spiritual wisdom, a chance to commune<br/>
with others in the peaceful setting provided at Woodland Altars.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and lest I forget, all of this is located in the middle of Amish<br/>
country, so we have also studied a bit about the Amish culture and<br/>
will visit one of the great Amish bakeries/bulk supply stores in the<br/>
area. What a weekend!<br/>
<br/>
Here are some web sites about all the stuff we have on the <br/>
smorgasbord for this weekend. Hopefully others will find time to <br/>
watch the eclipse, since it will be relatively early in the evening, <br/>
and find your own ways to celebrate the Harmonic Concordance, if that <br/>
happens to appeal to you. <br/>

&lt;&lt; That sounds like a great trip, Norma!  Thanks for the info.  That&#39;s the <br/>
kind of thing I&#39;d like to see more of on this list. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The best way to get the list to be the way you want it to be is to ask <br/>
questions and seed the discussions with your own stories of unschooling days, or <br/>
whatever it is.<br/>
<br/>
But for anyone who&#39;s craving more accounts of unschooling days right at this <br/>
moment, I have a collection of previously posted days (some from mailing <br/>
lists, some from unschooling.com) here:<br/>

Thanks for that great description.  Let us hear how it<br/>
all goes!  And the caving link was perfect for me. <br/>
I&#39;m taking my homeschool Roots & Shoots club on a<br/>
caving trip tomorrow morning.  Well, I should say I&#39;m<br/>
going along, but we&#39;ve got a caving enthusiast who is<br/>
actually leading the trip.  And we saw the lunar<br/>
eclipse tonight - it was spectacular!<br/>
<br/>
oh, I talked to my mom on the phone tonight.  Her big<br/>
worries (she hasn&#39;t written THE letter yet) are that<br/>
my son, age 8, isn&#39;t reading and that he is so<br/>
unhappy.  I told her that I hadn&#39;t thought of him as<br/>
unhappy, but I&#39;d think about it.  She managed to tell<br/>
me without yelling or anything, which was nice.  So<br/>
that was interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Quentin unhappy??? Maybe when we keep him away from<br/>
his Nintendo too long??? <br/>
