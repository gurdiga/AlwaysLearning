<div id="ygrps-yiv-184527997">There&#39;s a short article here and a picture.   There are probably better<br/>

The artist&#39;s name is Chris Ofili, from Nigeria.  The museum was the<br/>
Brooklyn Museum of Art, a show titled appropriately &quot;Sensation&quot;.   The<br/>
work was titled &quot;Holy Virgin Mary&quot; and it appeared in 1999.<br/>
<br/>
There was a huge up roar and a law suit and the only thing that came from<br/>
any of it I&#39;m sure is the Museum made a good deal of money.  Oh,  and I<br/>
discovered I am an artist. ( see previous post re: angel poop goiter)<br/>
