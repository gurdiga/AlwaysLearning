<div id="ygrps-yiv-1630616835">I&#39;ve been reading old homeschooling magazines and getting new ideas.<br/>
<br/>
This is from a book review (of Family Math: the Middle School Years) <br/>
published in the California Homeschooler, April 1999, by Cathy Koos <br/>
Breazeal.<br/>
<br/>
[her words]<br/>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
&quot;&quot;I am a product of &quot;The New Math.&quot;  Any of you old enough to remember <br/>
that educational disaster?<br/>
<br/>
Recently, I visited my parents&#39; home in Pennsylvania and, while browsing <br/>
through the attic library to see what books I could score to take home, <br/>
I saw a familiar yellow paperback book.  Just as an odor can evoke waves <br/>
of hidden memories, the sight of that yellow spine evoked such a strong <br/>
and unpleasant memory that I actually had to leave the room.<br/>
<br/>
What was the book? None other than the 4th grade &quot;New Math&quot; textbook; <br/>
the very one that has tear drops on many pages.  Tears shed night after <br/>
night as my Dad and I struggled to &quot;get&quot; the math.&quot;&quot;<br/>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
What I realized when I read this is that one reason &quot;New Math&quot; failed is <br/>
that the education establishment, in its vanity, underestimated how much <br/>
teaching is done at home, by parents helping their kids with homework. <br/>
By creating a new kind of math lessons that were incomprehensible to <br/>
most parents, a lot of students were &quot;set adrift&quot; on some stinky creek, <br/>
without anyone to help them paddle to shore.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I liked this idea.  I think that in both school attending and <br/>
non-school attending families, huge amounts of learning take place at <br/>
home.  I&#39;m often shocked when teachers think the solution to low test <br/>
scores is to shut children in classrooms for additional hours.  Yikes!<br/>
