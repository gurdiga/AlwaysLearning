&lt;&lt; *    Mitsubishi Chariot Grandis Royal &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I want one of these!<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, the last few times I&#39;ve seen a car I thought looked really cool, it <br/>
was a Mitsubishi of one sort or another.<br/>
<br/>
What I really, sinfully want is Buick.  But socially it&#39;s representational of <br/>
a type of life I will never live.  But what if I had one anyway?<br/>
<br/>
For years we eyed 15 passenger Dodge vans, after renting one on a family <br/>
visit to Minneapolis where Keith was working, after our 15 passenger Ford <br/>
not-fancy-but-big van turned to a storage van.<br/>
<br/>
Dodge no longer makes those vans.  And our kids are bigger now anyway so we <br/>
don&#39;t need the kidsx2 plus bikes van we once needed.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had two new cars in my life.  A 76 Honda Civic (right after they weren&#39;t <br/>
bathyspheres anymore) and an 84 VW Jetta.  We drove them both until they were <br/>
ragged.  Well, Keith&#39;s still driving the ragged VW.   I&#39;m driving a used <br/>
Dodge Caravan.   In the back yard is a 63 (?) Dodge pickup which runs kind of <br/>
sometimes, and a VW Golf wagon which dried up in my elderly neighbor&#39;s <br/>
driveway after her husband died.  At first she used to go and start the <br/>
engine once a week.  But later she couldn&#39;t.  MAYBE if it&#39;s flushed and gets <br/>
all new hoses it will still run.  It hasn&#39;t for over ten years, though.  We <br/>
inherited that.  Perhaps it&#39;s a little storage shed, or maybe it&#39;s Kirby&#39;s <br/>
first car.  We don&#39;t know yet and Keith himself is not a mechanic.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I had a &#39;76 Honda Civic too! Henry was his name. My first car. Cost $2,600 <br/>
brand spanking new (part of a down payment now!). I still miss Henry. I miss <br/>
being able to roll the passenger window down without even leaning over! &lt;G&gt; I <br/>
miss the little back seat which was a PERFECT saddle rack. I miss the little <br/>
cubby behind the seat where almost EVERYTHING fit. I miss parallel-parking in <br/>
one try! &lt;G&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Good ol&#39; Henri! (that&#39;s with a French accent)<br/>

<br/>
YES!  That was cool.<br/>
And it could make a u-turn on residential streets without a K-turn.  And I <br/>
had been driving VW bugs quite a bit before that one.  <br/>
<br/>
BUT... one bad thing.  I used to love when it would snow and I would take my <br/>
little VW bug out to a big paved parking lot and spin around and see the <br/>
patterns in the snow.  <br/>
<br/>
I took the Honda out on a beautiful snowy night, got going, threw on the <br/>
brakes, and it just STOPPED.   Would not slide.<br/>
<br/>
So I guess that wasn&#39;t a bad thing.  Just not a fun-in-parking-lot <br/>
pattern-making thing.  <br/>
<br/>
Duo-diagonal brakes.  Clever Japanese engineers.<br/>
<br/>
Mine came silver, but when it started to rust (they seemed to only have one <br/>
layer of paint) I had it re-painted the greenest green, a VW color called <br/>
&quot;Zambezi Green&quot; (I forget how to spell it), so I had the only green Honda <br/>
around.  It was the color of a green crayon.  A little darker.  Beautiful.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Henry was light metallic blue. Cool car. Yep, a 26&#39; turning radius. How do I <br/>
remember that? Also he held 10.6 gallons, and I could fill it for less than <br/>
$5.00!<br/>
<br/>
Good memories with that little car!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I recently saw a gardening column on cheap greenhouses.  They suggest <br/>
putting plastic down on the seats, cracking the windows (and being partly <br/>
in the shade) to make an excellent starter-space for your seedlings.  I <br/>
assume they meant that the seedlings would be in pots, but who knows.<br/>
Would that be Un-car-ing?<br/>
