<div id="ygrps-yiv-558743454">Development and patterns of children and discussion lists<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;WHO among those who have told their children &quot;no&quot; ten thousand<br/>
times<br/>
would believe me saying that a girl has said &quot;no thanks&quot; to all<br/>
manner of pressure for her to let me set her up with a TV in her<br/>
room, from the age of 12 to 14 (so far)? They wouldn&#39;t believe it<br/>
possible. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-But not all kids are like Holly.-=-<br/>
<br/>
That was my point.<br/>
Kirby and Marty aren&#39;t even like Holly.<br/>
<br/>
But someone in the family whose mom was able to post on this list  <br/>
that she wasn&#39;t sure if all the kids&#39; rooms had TVs or not must be  <br/>
like Holly.  Their kids aren&#39;t shoving up front to make sure they  <br/>
have a TV, or that if their sibling has one they have one too (TV or  <br/>
five dollars or a donut or whatever the thing is).<br/>
<br/>
But it doesn&#39;t matter if Holly is the only one in a world of six  <br/>
billion people who prefers not to have a TV.<br/>
<br/>
The point is that in a home in which the parents are willing and  <br/>
eager to provide their children with an in-bedroom TV, it has come to  <br/>
pass in that real-world longterm situation, that a young teen put the  <br/>
TV out of her room one day and hasn&#39;t wanted it back, nor a more  <br/>
convenient replacement.<br/>
<br/>
That fact disproves any and all claims of desperation, grabbiness,  <br/>
the commonly-stated &quot;evils&quot; of parents letting kids have a TV, the  <br/>
slippery-slope threats of what will happen if children are allowed to  <br/>
have TV in their rooms and never come out, and ALL of that.  It  <br/>
dissolves into a mist because Holly Dodd COULD have that and doesn&#39;t  <br/>
want it.  It is NOT a natural inevitable &quot;fact&quot; that if children  <br/>
aren&#39;t limited and controlled they WILL do nothing but watch TV, eat  <br/>
sugar, etc.  One of the entries in that current unschooling blog  <br/>
carnival has a GREAT list of such things that the mom came up with,  <br/>
but here are lots<br/>
  that real parents have stated in public about their own children.  <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/ifilet">http://sandradodd.com/ifilet</a><br/>
<br/>
Holly alone would disprove them.<br/>
But it&#39;s NOT Holly alone.  There are scores of children, in families  <br/>
on this list and related others, who DO have a HUGE range of choices,  <br/>
and they choose to be with their families, to hang out with their  <br/>
siblings, to do things with their parents, to be helpful to  <br/>
strangers.  BY CHOICE.  In the case of my own kids (and scores of  <br/>
others) it&#39;s not even out of religious obligation or to get a scout  <br/>
badge.  It is simply because it seems like the right thing to do at  <br/>
the moment, to help someone or to do little things that no one else  <br/>
will ever even know they did.<br/>
<br/>
I DO have really good kids, and yes, sometimes we get grouchy, but we  <br/>
don&#39;t rejoice in it or maintain and defend our arguments.  We see  <br/>
them, pull back out, make things better, and go again.  Because the  <br/>
principles on which all this nest of unschooling is based are part of  <br/>
the decision making of everyone involved, things work out better in  <br/>
2006 than they would have if we hadn&#39;t made conscious decisions to do  <br/>
the best we could based on our beliefs and intentions, in each of the  <br/>
past twenty years.<br/>
<br/>
ANYONE can move toward this.  Anyone could resist it and declare it  <br/>
not real.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone makes a conscious decision to move away from it, or to  <br/>
decide not to move toward it, it is certainly not that unschoolers  <br/>
haven&#39;t shared enough of their lives.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some archives to read if anyone doubts my statement above:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/messages">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/messages</a><br/>
26,500 messages, but others will be posted today.  Nearly five years&#39;  <br/>
worth.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.google.com/group/UnschoolingDiscussion">http://groups.google.com/group/UnschoolingDiscussion</a><br/>
newer location for that list, open archive, 336 topics some with  <br/>
dozens of posts, some shorter<br/>
<br/>
Older location, you&#39;d have to join the list to read the archives but  <br/>
that&#39;s doable:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/UnschoolingDiscussion">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/UnschoolingDiscussion</a><br/>
113,154 posts over seven years.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a lot of people sharing the details of their very real  <br/>
unschooling lives.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think we should have to repeat it all from scratch to prove  <br/>
we&#39;re &quot;real.&quot;  Good parts are collected here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/">http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/</a><br/>
and<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschooling">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a><br/>
and both of those have MANY links to other people&#39;s sites.<br/>
<br/>
Am I repeating myself?  I did change the name of the topic.  But of  <br/>
course we repeat ourselves on these lists.  And often we provide  <br/>
links to something that we *could* tell again but it&#39;s easier to  <br/>
share a piece of writing that was particularly good.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind repeating myself.  Nobody makes me keep this list.  I  <br/>
could close it today, delete my site, stop sharing.   I choose not  <br/>
to.    It&#39;s fine for people to partake of those resources or not.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s fine for people to say &quot;Throw me a bone...are you for real?&quot;   <br/>
People make choices.<br/>
It&#39;s fine for me to see it as tacky.<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of this list was clearly stated five years ago and is  <br/>
still here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/</a><br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-597274461">You&#39;re missing my intent and my question, and my humor.   As I said it<br/>
was a genuine question, not a dig.  But I&#39;m snarky (love that new word)<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;It is NOT a natural inevitable &quot;fact&quot; that if children  <br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;ANYONE can move toward this.  Anyone could resist it and declare it  <br/>

&quot;I wasn&#39;t saying it wasn&#39;t real.  I was saying I needed to hear<br/>
something besides the fluffy stuff.  I am not as crafty with words and<br/>
expressing myself as you are.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t think we should have to repeat it all...<br/>
Am I repeating myself?  <br/>
But of course we repeat ourselves on these lists.  <br/>

Huh?<br/>

I said &quot;I just want to KNOW you are real&quot;.<br/>
Excuse the &quot;throw me a bone&quot;, but I just love that expression.<br/>

I think I should post my own good unschooling day and bad unschooling<br/>
day, for the archives.</div>

<br/>
We&#39;ve shown examples of people who do not.<br/>
You will not find an example of anyone who did.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/ifilet">http://sandradodd.com/ifilet</a><br/>
<br/>
It is not possible.<br/>
To claim it&#39;s possible is entirely disrespectful of children and  <br/>
shows a lack of awareness of human nature.<br/>
<br/>
It is not a fact that all dogs have four legs.<br/>
You could respond with &quot;But it&#39;s certainly possible.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That isn&#39;t logical.<br/>
One three-legged dog disproves it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-You&#39;re missing my intent and my question, and my humor.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Your intent and your question seem clear.<br/>
The humor wasn&#39;t apparent at all.<br/>
<br/>
In April you criticized this list, and me.  If it hasn&#39;t improved for  <br/>
you since April, it probably won&#39;t.  There are other lists here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/lists/other">http://sandradodd.com/lists/other</a><br/>
You&#39;re welcome to stay here, but reading the links people provide and  <br/>
actually thinking about it will  do you and your children better than  <br/>
insulting those who are voluntarily helping you, even if you thought  <br/>
you were being funny.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I wasn&#39;t saying it wasn&#39;t real. I was saying I needed to hear<br/>
something besides the fluffy stuff. I am not as crafty with words and<br/>
expressing myself as you are.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Those who can&#39;t drive safely shouldn&#39;t drive.  It&#39;s not good for them  <br/>
or others.<br/>
If you can&#39;t write without a knowledge of when you&#39;re being rude, be  <br/>
more careful where you write.<br/>
<br/>
To try to defend this morning&#39;s rudeness by now describing the  <br/>
sharings of so many who ARE good with words, and who volunteer quite  <br/>
a bit of time and energy to helping others as &quot;FLUFFY STUFF&quot; makes  <br/>
you look not only crafty, but insincere.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I was saying I needed to hear something besides the fluffy stuff.-=-<br/>
  -=-Excuse the &quot;throw me a bone&quot;, but I just love that expression.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Words should be used thoughtfully and deliberately.  There are times  <br/>
and places for different phrases.  As list owner, I will let you know  <br/>
that this list isn&#39;t the place to insult those who are voluntarily  <br/>
offering advice you&#39;re unlikely to find many other places.<br/>

If you&#39;re unable to separate discussion of ideas from discussion of  <br/>
individuals, it might be best to lurk.<br/>
Joyce has written quite a bit, and clearly, about the discussion of  <br/>
principles.<br/>
<br/>
Some is here:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/lists/faq">http://sandradodd.com/lists/faq</a><br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s more at that link, but here&#39;s something good, written on and  <br/>
about this particular list:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The list is about ideas, not about people.<br/>
Think of ideas like balls and the list like a ball court. If someone  <br/>
tosses an idea worth discussing into the court it&#39;s going to get  <br/>
batted about. At that point what&#39;s going on is no longer about the  <br/>
person who tossed the idea in. It&#39;s about the idea and how well and  <br/>
cleanly it&#39;s being tossed about. (Unless the tosser keeps jumping in  <br/>
and grabbing the idea ball saying &quot;Mine!&quot;)<br/>
