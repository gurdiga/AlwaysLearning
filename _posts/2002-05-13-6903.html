<div id="ygrps-yiv-1195706504">I&#39;ve received some e-mails in the last couple of days which have &quot;Re: <br/>
[Always Learning] Opp&quot; as the subject line (referring, I guess, to my <br/>
post entitled &quot;Opportunities missed&quot;). When I open them there is a small <br/>
box with symbols inside and that&#39;s all.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have any ideas what that&#39;s about? (I have a Mac, if that makes <br/>
any difference....)<br/>

It may be possible that you are receiving the virus that is going around. Do you have a virus protection program running on your system? And if you do, does it include a check on emails? I am running Norton Anti Virus, it checks all emails as they come in, and has caught the same one several times from this group as well as Unschooling Dot Com. I have repeatedly asked if anyone knows about it, but I get no response.<br/>

grab addresses out of your  address book or even emails you&#39;ve received <br/>
(like from this list) and stick them into the to and/or from lines to send <br/>
the virus out.<br/>
The important thing is what Rebecca said about virus protection.  You want <br/>
the ones you can set up to update automatically.  There are new viruses <br/>
found almost daily.  At least that&#39;s how often mine tells me it wants to do <br/>
an update.  It checks for them every time I go online.<br/>
