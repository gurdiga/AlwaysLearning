Mixture of alcohol and other things not supposed to be in a drink.  <br/>
Mustard...pickle juice and all sorts of other stuff.  YUCK.  and to be swigged from an army <br/>
boot.  Oh my younger days.   LOL<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-778443480">I&#39;m guessing that by now someone has answered the &#39;what is Grok&#39; question.  If not, tho, the word is used in a book called Stranger in a Strange Land, by Robert Heinlein and, loosely translated/explained, means to think, tho it&#39;s really somewhat more complicated than that in the context used in the book.  Thanks for the question -- it reminds me that I&#39;ve been meaning to re-read Stranger...<br/>
