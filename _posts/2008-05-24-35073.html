<div id="ygrps-yiv-917473384">hi all -<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;ve been on this list for a few weeks and wanted to introduce myself.<br/>
 my name is lyssa, mom to jessica (7) and henry (5).  we live & learn<br/>
in maryland and are very fortunate to know several unschooling<br/>
families in the area.<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;ve been enjoying all of the discussions on this list and the one on<br/>
stress relievers hit very close to home.  my mother has als, which is<br/>
a fatal neurodegenerative disease.  she&#39;s had it for the past 4 years<br/>
and we&#39;ve visited her every 2 weeks (we live 2 hours away).  we are<br/>
fortunate to have a supportive network of extended family and friends,<br/>
but sometimes, it can be an emotional stress...when we visit, we are<br/>
calm and present for my mom and dad and then when we return, i feel<br/>
like i have what i can only describe as an emotional hangover...my<br/>
kids and husband feel like this too, but i think my daughter and i are<br/>
hit the hardest.<br/>
<br/>
i really like all of the tips people have shared (and will revisit<br/>
these a lot, i think).  one thing that has really helped us immensely<br/>
is to s-l-o-w down after our visits.  we all need at least 1/2 day to<br/>
just be still and this really helps.  the other thing that has helped<br/>
is to do some simple things that help us all get ourselves in balance.<br/>
 it differs for each of us but includes baths, nature, video games,<br/>
movies, books, cuddles, or just being alone.  being part of this list<br/>
and reading other unschooling material has helped so much b/c i<br/>
realize that my kids are really good judges of how to bring themselves<br/>
back into balance.<br/>
<br/>
the thing that is the hardest for me is when i am completely drained<br/>
and my kids really, really need me.  that shift - trying to connect<br/>
with them - is difficult, but it does get easier with practice.  we&#39;re<br/>
all getting better at learning how to identify and release our emotions. <br/>
<br/>
while this situation is stressful, we have been able to appreciate all<br/>
of the joyful things in our lives.  stress has helped us to prioritize<br/>
and decide what is important.  we are also getting better and better<br/>
at choosing what brings us joy and happiness, a very good antidote to<br/>
stress...<br/>
<br/>
anyway, just wanted to thank all of you for the great discussions.<br/>
<br/>
best, lyssa</div>

<br/>
Could it also just be described as exhaustion?<br/>
<br/>
Mental/emotional exhaustion seems to me more tiring, less satisfying,  <br/>
more confusing than physical exhaustion.  I think it&#39;s because our  <br/>
culture prizes physical labor and is suspicious and disdainful of  <br/>
emotional effort.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Is it a holding-your-breath calm?  A watching the clock calm?  I  <br/>
think I mean to ask whether you&#39;re acting calm.  Acting calm takes  <br/>
way more effort than being calm.<br/>
<br/>
I have a quote I&#39;ve been meaning to build a discussion around, and I  <br/>
still will (with the story of where it came from) but this is the  <br/>
quote, and it was about Buddhist-style meditation:<br/>
<br/>
&quot; I found ultimately though that I can&#39;t go on acting like I&#39;m just  <br/>
observing my anger (which does really work for many people I  <br/>
know...I&#39;m not saying it is the wrong way or that it doesn&#39;t work!). &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe substitute &quot;stress&quot; or &quot;concern&quot; for &quot;anger&quot; and see if it  <br/>
rings any bells.  If not, GOOD!  I&#39;m hoping you&#39;re saying you&#39;re  <br/>
really, truly calm when you&#39;re with your parents.<br/>

This is big.<br/>
<br/>
Marty is introverted like his dad, and also a big showman like his  <br/>
dad when he IS in groups.  But he needs recovery from his showiness.   <br/>
It drains him instead of feeding him.  It&#39;s just the way he is.  So  <br/>
Marty needs a lot of quiet time alone.  It might be watching videos  <br/>
or playing games, but it&#39;s not interacting with other people, not  <br/>
even family members.  We leave him alone for long stretches because  <br/>
we know (from knowing Keith) that it&#39;s a real need, and he makes good  <br/>
use of it.<br/>

  ****<br/>
  Gary (dh) and Andy (ds) are like this, too.  It can be very easy for people who don&#39;t someone like Keith or Marty or Andy well to assume they&#39;re extroverts who are energized by being outgoing.  It&#39;s good that y&#39;all figured out what Keith and Marty need to recover.<br/>
