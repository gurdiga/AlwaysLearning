<div id="ygrps-yiv-504265521">Retta Fontana&#39;s posting is what I also have been doing with husband.<br/>
<br/>
It was some month ago that it came to my mind that unschooling was not only<br/>
toward dd or towards myself.  It was also towards husband.  Retta when<br/>
further and she is right.  It applies to all people around us.<br/>
<br/>
Retta, thank you for the eyes opening post.  I wonder why I haven&#39;t had<br/>
noticed it earlier.<br/>
<br/>
love and peace, noemi</div>
