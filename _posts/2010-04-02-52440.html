<div id="ygrps-yiv-783125145">My 6yo asked for sea monkeys after a friend told him about them. We got the kit yesterday. We set up the water and put the eggs in today. He is so excited. He says he has to take them with us when we visit Grandma next week. That&#39;s cool enough. Another very cool thing, though, is that the older guys are almost more excited about them. These guys are 19-21 years old. They looked at the instruction booklet and have asked me several times what sea monkeys really look like. I don&#39;t know because I&#39;ve never seen them. I told them they&#39;ll have to wait until they hatch. It&#39;s so fun to see these older guys excited about and interested in sea monkeys, of all things! <br/>

There are also Triops that you can hatch and watch, think prehistoric tadpoles with three eyes....here is some more info<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1773561778">I always wanted Sea Monkeys as a kid - kept seeing them in the back of<br/>
Archie comics, but never got them . until now! My older dd received a kit<br/>
last year, but never set it up. So when I was cleaning her room over<br/>
Christmas and found them, I asked if I could set up . &quot;yes&quot;. My younger dd<br/>
and I take care of them (feed them, add water, watch them in awe), and they<br/>
are so super cool! They breed like crazy . we have 4 mamas right now and<br/>
babies from the size of a pencil point on up. They have clear bodies, so you<br/>
can tell who is pregnant. They drift to the bottom when they die and algae<br/>
totally builds up, but I have read this is okay. We are checking out buying<br/>
accessories for them, like maybe a bigger tank ... just search for &quot;sea<br/>
monkeys&quot; and you&#39;ll find some really neat sites (i.e.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-594048848">This is funny. I was just reading that triops apparently eat each<br/>
other. I wonder if this is because they don&#39;t have enough food or if<br/>
they are just carnivorous and the only carne in the tank is each<br/>
other.<br/>
<br/>
In anyone&#39;s experience, are seamonkeys cannibals too?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-372522036">Guppies are cannibals, even with lots of food in the tank. I got to see a guppy born and eaten within a couple of blinks of an eye. That was a pretty good nature red in tooth and claw moment. I don&#39;t know about sea monkeys, though. <br/>
