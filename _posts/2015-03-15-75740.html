<div id="ygrps-yiv-1381591786">-=-She could join the military, could enroll in an ivy league college...but she can&#39;t enroll in beauty school? -=-<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t about unschooling, though.  Different institutions can create their own rules and requirements.  They&#39;re not about learning, they&#39;re about hurdles that apply to anyoneâ€”people who went through the system, or dropped out, or came from another country, or didn&#39;t go to school.<br/>
<br/>
She should take a GED, or find something that doesn&#39;t require one.  Don&#39;t make a bigger deal of it than it needs to be.  <br/>
<br/>
She can take the test cold, and if she passes it&#39;s done.  If she doesn&#39;t, then she&#39;ll know which section she was weak on and could study just that one.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-And now we&#39;re in a mess.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t see the mess part, in your account.  <br/>

In&nbsp; the end she wasn&#39;t wanting to enroll as a&nbsp; degree student so they let her enroll as a non-degree student and she took classes for 2 semesters.&nbsp; She did have to take the placement test (all enrollees did) which helped them select the appropriate math class for her (the only section she had trouble with).</p><p><br></p><p>Now my son is 16 and was wanting to do the same thing.&nbsp; But since my daughter&#39;s enrollment, that school&nbsp;formalized their rules to state that all students needed a GED to enroll if they do not have a HS diploma.&nbsp; They do have the new test in MA now called the HiSet. He is taking the free classes offered by the same community college.&nbsp; He has done the practice tests and the instructor(s) have told him that he doesn&#39;t need to worry about several subjects, and he is focusing on the ones he does need (mainly formal math).&nbsp; He is liking the classes.</p><p><br></p><p>Many institutions accept homeschooled students without a formal diploma/GED, but others do not.&nbsp; Check in your area for free GED classes and it likely isn&#39;t a huge hoop for her to jump through.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Jon<br class="ygrps-yiv-1068852032yui-cursor"></p></div>
