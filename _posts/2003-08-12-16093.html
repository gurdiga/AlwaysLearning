fear about the conference is that I&#39;m going to revert back to high school<br/>

<br/>
The first time I went to a conference where I could meet online friends <br/>
I went back into the bathroom to comb my hair and wash my hands and get <br/>
up my nerve seven times.  Well, maybe it was only four or five, but it <br/>
sure felt like seven.<br/>
<br/>
So, my tip is &quot;if overwhelmed by fear, then hide in the bathroom and say <br/>
&quot;Hello&quot; to everyone who joins you there, because they&#39;re probably shy, too&quot;.<br/>

Have a good time!<br/>

Rue - you just described me to a tee.<br/>
That was/is me too, shy and it&#39;s hard for me to walk up to a group and join<br/>
in.<br/>
Just a few months ago, a lady in our homeschool group said I reminded her of<br/>

Please someone pull me into the group, too, because I want to be there but<br/>
