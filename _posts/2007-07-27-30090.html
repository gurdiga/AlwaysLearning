<div id="ygrps-yiv-1936001877">I think you should go to Berkeley, and just get out and walk around  <br/>
and walk into a residential neighborhood.  The houses are really  <br/>
pretty there.  I don&#39;t know the names of the stations there, but  <br/>
there&#39;s one in a neighborhood, and one by a big parking lot, and I  <br/>
think one by the university (UC Berkeley).  It&#39;s fun to go under the  <br/>
bay in the dark and think of how deep and dark it is... unless that  <br/>
would spook you, then don&#39;t.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-50827962">Hey, Sandra, next time you&#39;re in Berkeley, come by my house.<br/>
<br/>
And, Joyce, the offer still stands for you guys too!<br/>
<br/>
Berkeley is the place to come and eat, home of Alice Waters, and much <br/>
delicious, less expensive fare.  Also, there are the <br/>
remnants-of-the-60s sights.  And our humble abode, which is about 10 <br/>
houses north of the Berkeley line.<br/>
<br/>
There are a couple of art schools over here on this side of the bay <br/>
too.  An older one, California College of Arts and Crafts.  And one <br/>
that sounds intriguing to me, a digital arts one, called Ex&#39;pression, <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.expression.edu/">http://www.expression.edu/</a>  .<br/>
<br/>
As for San Francisco, I&#39;d go to the Embarcadero BART station on <br/>
Saturday, and cross the street to an amazing farmers market and the <br/>
extravagant food hall at the Ferry Building.  You may not be able to <br/>
afford much but what you eat will be delicious and you&#39;ll get some <br/>
idea of this area&#39;s passions about fresh, local food..  Then you can <br/>
walk or rent bikes or any number of bizarre vehicles or just take an <br/>
old fashioned trolley down the embarcadero and enjoy the views.  Pier <br/>
39 and Fishermans wharf are ultra touristy but Pier 39 has all the <br/>
sea lions that hang out there and at Fisherman&#39;s wharf, there&#39;s a <br/>
place that has all these cool old arcade games from the old Playland <br/>
at the Beach.  It&#39;s called Musee Mechanique, <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.museemechanique.org/">http://www.museemechanique.org/</a>  And in the Cannery, one of those old <br/>
factories-gone tourist shops, near the shop that only sells socks, <br/>
there&#39;s the coolest musical instrument store, Lark in the Morning <br/>
(they have a great catalog too), where you can try everything.<br/>
<br/>
Also from the Embarcadero BART, you can take a cable car which I <br/>
still love  even though only tourists ride them.  The crowds at <br/>
Embarcadero tend to be smaller than the crowds at Powell Street for <br/>
the cable car.  The cable cars have fabulous views from the tops of <br/>
hills, so try to be where you can see out.  The cable car museum is <br/>
on the route and free and really cool if anyone is into transit or <br/>
local history.  It&#39;s amazing they&#39;ve been running theses things the <br/>
same way for over a hundred years.<br/>
<br/>
We also love Zeum, which is right in the middle of town.  Maybe we <br/>
could do that with you, cause it&#39;s fun with a group?  There you can <br/>
do claymation, video production, perform and record kareoke, do <br/>
computer graphics, an, my favorite, play on a life size labyrinth <br/>
(the tilting kind with a metal ball).  And that&#39;s right near the SF <br/>
Museum of Modern Art and bunches of other stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Then there&#39;s Golden Gate Park with a few days worth of stuff to <br/>
do.  That would mean a bus ride from BART, but not hard.  And renting <br/>
bikes there would be great cause you could see a lot more that <br/>
way.  The Conservatory of Flowers is way cool and I think the <br/>
Japanese Tea Garden is fun, but touristy.<br/>
<br/>
Or...you can take the ferry across the bay to Alameda (where we&#39;re <br/>
having our unschoolers park day on Friday!) or Oakland.  If you go to <br/>
Oakland, you can walk to a real Chinatown, not the more touristy San <br/>
Fransisco one.  You could take BART back to SF.<br/>
<br/>
Hope we get to see you!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I second all the recommendations so far. SF and Berkeley are both  <br/>
great walking cities. And all the public trans is great, not only  <br/>
BART. In the city, there&#39;s buses, cable cars, and trams. I&#39;d get a  <br/>
good transit map and then just pick some neighborhoods and wander.  <br/>
Chinatown, North Beach, the Mission, even downtown and Union Square,  <br/>
all good. It&#39;s fun just to look at the architecture and the  <br/>
topography because it&#39;s so different from the East Coast. Berkeley  <br/>
has Moe&#39;s, one of the all time best used book stores ever. It&#39;s right  <br/>
on the main drag near the campus, Telegraph Ave.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-902734160">OK, my husband Eric weighed in here too:<br/>
<br/>
If you are bikers, rent a bike and go across the Golden Gate Bridge <br/>
and to the west on the Marin side of the bridge up to Hawk Hill for <br/>
spectacular views and the just-beginning raptor migration south.  A <br/>
strenuous ride.  (Easy to do by car, as well.)<br/>
<br/>
He also says, if you come from landlocked places, you gotta see the <br/>
ocean.  Taking the 38 Geary Limited bus all the way west through the <br/>
city out to Ocean Beach would be a tour in itself. You can catch it <br/>
at Montgomery BART.  You won&#39;t have a tour guide but you&#39;ll hear four <br/>
or five different languages!<br/>
<br/>
And he says Alcatraz is great, as does everybody else who&#39;s ever <br/>
been.  I&#39;ve never done it!  And Eric hadn&#39;t until last year even <br/>
though he&#39;s a native to Berkeley.</div>

<br/>
Alcatraz is great.<br/>
Absolutely, even if just for the ferry ride.  The ferry has a museum  <br/>
downstairs, kind of, a history of how the ferry engines were  <br/>
developed.  &quot;Walking foot engine,&quot; kind of a giant wankle engine, one  <br/>
piston...   And the island itself is cool, and the buildings, and the  <br/>
flora, and the buildings and the stories!!!<br/>

<br/>
Ah, it&#39;s been a long time.  I used to go to SCA board meetings when  <br/>
they were all in the Bay area, late 70&#39;s, early 80&#39;s.  I was there  <br/>
three or four times a year, in Berkeley or Milpitas, doing what  <br/>
touristing I could in the single free afternoon of three or six days  <br/>
of work on meeting prep and then preparation of minutes (18 pages,  <br/>
give or take six), and then I&#39;d print and mail them when I got  <br/>
home...  all Pre-momhood.   Not the most medieval part of the SCA,  <br/>
and it&#39;s all changed now anyway.  But I was fortunate to get to visit  <br/>
there so often.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-596957618">Hi Joyce,<br/>
   <br/>
  You can get a bus pass (it lets you have unlimited travel on the buses and cable cars) for a really reasonable rate. You can buy them for a day or multiple days. Last time I was there we got them in our hotel lobby&#39;s store. Here&#39;s a link to the visitor passports -  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sfmta.com/cms/mfares/passports.htm">http://www.sfmta.com/cms/mfares/passports.htm</a><br/>
  Seeing as the cable cars cost $5 each way, this is really a bargain!<br/>
   <br/>
  I would go wander around the Haight Ashbury area (my old stomping grounds and very like berkeley &lt;g&gt;) and from there, you can go into Golden Gate Park. The Japanese Tea Garden, the Arboretum, and the de Young Musuem (highly recommended if you&#39;re into art!) are all close to the Stanyan St entrance to the park. Also, if you want more art...SF MOMA musuem is worth a trip (it&#39;s just south of Market St) and The Legion of Honor are great places to go. It will probably take a few buses to get to The Legion, but imo, it&#39;s worth it. Here&#39;s another link to the de Young and The Legion - <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.thinker.org/">http://www.thinker.org/</a><br/>
   <br/>
  Hope you have a great time! <br/>
  We&#39;re off to Florida on Monday for a couple of weeks and then onto the HSC conference shortly after we get home, so even though I don&#39;t post much, I&#39;ll not be reading either :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1026476968">Hi all!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much for all the help. It gave us great places to start.<br/>
<br/>
In retrospect we should have figured out the bus system in addition  <br/>
to BART. We did a lot of walking. A lot. :-) But we got to experience  <br/>
San Francisco up close and personal in a way we wouldn&#39;t have otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
We saw Chinatown three times on the way to various places and only  <br/>
got to see the Golden Gate Bridge from a distance ;-) The wait for  <br/>
the trolleys was way too long (though supposedly it&#39;s less at  <br/>
Embarcadero but we never got off there) but we saw them plenty! We  <br/>
got to walk up Lombard Street. Japantown (since Kat has a big  <br/>
interest in manga and anime and Japan in general.) Bought lots of  <br/>
manga and tea on the trip. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Apparently Alcatraz needs reservations 3 months in advance during the  <br/>
summer, at least for the National Park Service ferry (I think it  <br/>
was). Anyway we only had one day totally free and my sister isn&#39;t an  <br/>
early riser ;-) so we didn&#39;t get to go. We saw that from a distance  <br/>
too :-)<br/>
<br/>
I did get to meet Betsy and Pam and Robyn (while Kat and Carl were at  <br/>
an Oakland Athletics game). We all recognized each other immediately  <br/>
even though we hadn&#39;t met before. :-) And they showed me around  <br/>
Berkeley. I took my family over there on Saturday and was able to  <br/>
show them around like I knew what I was doing :-)<br/>
<br/>
I think the thing that struck me the most -- at least the thing I  <br/>
didn&#39;t expect since obviously the hills are the most prominent  <br/>
feature of SF! -- are the variety of trees. We have maybe 4 basic  <br/>
varieties that dominate. There seem to be dozens of different trees  <br/>
in the parks. And the weather! It was tough coming back to hot humid  <br/>
Boston. (Though since those first couple of days back it&#39;s been  <br/>
really nice here.)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the suggestions!<br/>
<br/>
Joyce</div>
