Did you read any?  They are killing those movies.  And it&#39;s &quot;Crimson Tide,&quot; <br/>
not &quot;The Crimson Tide&quot; (unless it&#39;s some Alabama football documentary).<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s part of the pin they stuck in Much Ado about Nothing:<br/>
<br/>
Romantic Relationships: <br/>
2.  During the first part of the play, why were Beatrice and Benedick always <br/>
saying unpleasant things to each other? <br/>
3.  The witty banter of Beatrice and Benedick shows that they are both very <br/>
intelligent. Why were they unable to see that they cared for each other? Why <br/>
did Benedick say such stupid things about marriage? How could people as smart <br/>
as Beatrice and Benedick not realize their affection for each other and then <br/>
permit themselves to be brought together by a transparent deception? <br/>
4.  The relationship of Hero and Claudio is so frail that it can be destroyed <br/>
by the deceptions arranged by Don John. What does this say about their <br/>
relationship? <br/>
5.  Do you think that Hero and Claudio are mature enough to make rational <br/>
decisions about romance and marriage? At the beginning of the film, were <br/>
Benedick and Beatrice making rational decisions about romance and marriage? <br/>
6.  How does this film show the cruelty of love? Give at least two examples. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How does this schoolification of perfectly good movies gag me?  Let me count <br/>
the ways.<br/>
<br/>
Nah. Let me not. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some of the comments were okay, but to inflict all that on a child who just <br/>
wants to watch a movie with his mom is horrible.<br/>
<br/>
Last night we watched Forrest Gump--my husband, me, Marty and Holly.  Holly <br/>
was making a castle with blocks at the same time, and we didn&#39;t draw her <br/>
attention to gross or sad parts.  We identified famous people by name if the <br/>
narration hadn&#39;t done so, and we didn&#39;t make any speeches.  We answered kids&#39; <br/>
questions and commented to their comments, but there certainly wasn&#39;t a <br/>
test!!  <br/>
<br/>
I think a set of questions on each movie would turn kids against movies.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-948716499">I liked this site and will refer to it as a list of movies to choose from when we are in the mood to see one. But I&#39;ll probably skip the questions and just watch the movie. Or ask my own questions if I think of any. ;-)<br/>

making it part of the curriculum...<br/>
