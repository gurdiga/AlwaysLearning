<div id="ygrps-yiv-1410367755">I&#39;m looking at satellite radio for Ben for Christmas.<br/>
<br/>
Do any of you have experience with it? Sirius or XM?<br/>
<br/>
I think he&#39;d be more interested in having it in the house with the <br/>
option of in the car. It seems as if they&#39;re sold the opposite way! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Any help would be great!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1467742013">Hi,<br/>
My family and I bought Sirius radio back in August, and have loved <br/>
it! My brother had it first and has both the house and car kit, and <br/>
I think the boom box. Every time we would visit a great song would <br/>
come on and finally we said hey, we need to pay for this stuff!! Sad <br/>
I know that you have to pay for creative radio, but its worth it! I <br/>
purchased the basic car stereo for myself and the portable one for <br/>
hubby since he uses it for work and it has headphones, etc. At home <br/>
I just tap into it via the computer for free, the chanels available <br/>
on the computer are fewer than what&#39;s on the actual system but I <br/>
still get the chanels I like, for instance Jam bands and kids music. <br/>
My husband loves the comedy stuff and metal lol. There is some <br/>
vulgar language on some of the chanels....Sirius costumer service <br/>
has been great and you can travel without worrying about finding <br/>
good stations out of town. We pay like 12 a month for the first <br/>
radio and 1/2 that for the 2nd and they are always running specials.<br/>
Anyway sorry for the short novel and good luck ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1652246690">I am a radio &quot;nut,&quot; but I am a talk radio fanatic. Though I&#39;m sure I <br/>
would like a lot of the music at times, talk radio would be what I <br/>
would want Sirius or XM for. Could anyone tell me which one seems to <br/>
be better? I am so disgusted with local radio stations these days. <br/>
Our stations here hire and fire so fast I never know who will be on <br/>
the air from week to week!! NPR is an option, but I don&#39;t know why I <br/>
can&#39;t take to it. There&#39;s something about NPR that puts me to <br/>
sleep!  LOL<br/>

anticipation of a long car trip to Seattle & back.  We both love it &<br/>
are very happy to have it.<br/>
