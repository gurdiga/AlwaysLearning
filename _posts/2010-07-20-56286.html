<div id="ygrps-yiv-266924575">&quot;Remember Claire? I&#39;ve been getting spam every week or so. Apparently  <br/>
that&#39;s why she joined the list, to phish by hand perhaps the almost  <br/>
3000 email addys of the members. That&#39;s so fishy. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so sorry, folks.  We should have booted her as soon as we saw her  <br/>
site, but thought maybe, just maybe, she actually wants to learn.<br/>
<br/>
If you are getting spam from Claire Marketos, I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s  <br/>
a way to make that cease without going to her site.   AH yes, you  <br/>
can.  The e-mails say  &quot;If you do not wish to receive information  <br/>
reply to this email with unsubscribe in the subject line&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not receiving any.   I&#39;m not surprised.  She came on like a borg  <br/>
advance scout, totally ignoring questions like &quot;Are you unschooling?&quot;  <br/>
from moderators.<br/>
<br/>
Her site is very much NOT about unschooling, nor helpful to unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
I eventually banned her from the list, but not before she pulled some  <br/>
e-mails.   I&#39;m sorry.<br/>
