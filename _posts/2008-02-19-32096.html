You could ask your husband how he intends to enforce &quot;just behave.&quot;    <br/>
Maybe talk about the principle of learning everywhere all the time,  <br/>
and that you&#39;re not in the store to be photographed as a perfect  <br/>
family.    But more importantly, why is your son in the store?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If learning is more important that being still, that helps.  If it&#39;s  <br/>
a store with carts, would her ride inside the big part of a cart?   <br/>
(I&#39;m picturing a home improvement store with the big carts...)<br/>
<br/>
Asking your husband things like &quot;Why?&quot; and &quot;How?&quot; and &quot;What&#39;s the  <br/>
purpose&quot; might help.  Does your husband want him to behave so that  <br/>
your husband can shop as though the son isn&#39;t there?   (He might just  <br/>
not have thought abut it much.)  Stores can be a great place for  <br/>
learning.  You can talk about things you don&#39;t own.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How are kids supposed to learn how to &quot;behave&quot; unless we show them <br/>
another better way?  I think redirecting is the best way to <br/>
demonstrate another better way to behave in a store.<br/>
<br/>
Just for the record, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen a 6 yo silently <br/>
comply with behaving like a little minature adult in a store.  A <br/>
happy kid is generally the best behaved sort of kid in a store, the <br/>
kids being punished and yelled at are usually the loud and reckless <br/>
ones.<br/>
<br/>
On some occasions, I simply can&#39;t take my 6 yo to the store because <br/>
there would be no way to help her be happy with it.  It&#39;s good to <br/>
recognize when to leave the store with an unhappy child and go wait <br/>
out in the car and listen to music.  Heck, sometimes, I don&#39;t feel <br/>
like going to the store, only I know how to &quot;behave&quot;, but even so, <br/>
the experience isn&#39;t the same as going when I want to go and enjoying <br/>
my time there.</div>
