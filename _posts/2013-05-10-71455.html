<div id="ygrps-yiv-1807079505">Hi,  I have been facing a similar situation.  It has helped us to brainstorm things that help him to feel better, or places to go to release the frustration so that it doesn&#39;t come out at home.  Then, just like I&#39;d do with my kids, I notice warning signs and gently suggest that now might be a good time to go for a walk, or whatever it is that helps him.  Also, we read through Bach Flower remedy descriptions and found some that really fit- along the lines of feeling trapped or helpless and a few others.  It does seem to help him to sip on water with a few drops of these remedies mixed in!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also made a huge effort to shower him with compassion and love and physical touch.  It makes a big difference for him and for my own feelings, and for our relationship.  <br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
Ali</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1297002717">Hi again. Thank you all for the suggestions. There were some great ones! I can&#39;t believe it has never occurred to me to do a spreadsheet before. Sometimes I don&#39;t seem to think about practical approaches because I am busy stewing about how much the containers are bugging me. I feel better now I&#39;ve read your responses,  knowing there are other things to consider. He does have tools and machinery he would look on as irreplaceable- they either have special history, or he bought then at such bargain prices, he knows that kind of special find is unlikely to happen twice. Thanks for that reminder.<br/>
<br/>
We have advertised on our local online classifieds for a suitable acreage, and I have asked contacts on Facebook to keep an eye out for something for us, so there&#39;s hope. We are also going to advertise in the newspaper. I don&#39;t think I could work right now, with unschooling 2 children and a toddler. Kudos to anyone who can manage a job whilst unschooling! <br/>
<br/>
I find that when I am feeling resentful about something he has done/is doing, I withdraw quite a bit physically. We have a 1 year old sharing a bed with us so intimacy is rare at the moment, but thinking about it, I don&#39;t even kiss or hug him much anymore. I guess I&#39;ve been waiting for things to get better between us, thinking then I might be more affectionate. When another way of looking at it, is if I&#39;m more affectionate, things might get better between us. Thanks again.<br/>
<br/>
Kerrie.</div>
