<div id="ygrps-yiv-1413273735">Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been so busy this past week I have only had time to barely skim my <br/>
digests.  But this morning my kids are occupying themselves and I have a <br/>
few precious moments to myself and thought I&#39;d read my email!  And boy, <br/>
there is something going on today, huh?  Or at least on that other list <br/>
Sandra attached.<br/>
<br/>
It is downright odd that someone would compare raising dogs to raising <br/>
kids.  However, it just might point out a blanket societal approach to <br/>
them.  Might explain a few things I have witnessed time and time again.  <br/>
Yep, SIT OR I AM COMING OVER THERE! I don&#39;t find those jokes funny at <br/>
all.  Hitting kids, humiliating kids, controlling kids -- none of that <br/>
is funny to me.  It is sad beyond comprehension.  It is nightmare <br/>
material to me.<br/>
<br/>
A woman I know says that she feels OK about being the only person for <br/>
25,000 miles in any given direction who feels X about X.  (We live in a <br/>
tiny little conservative town.....)  She says it makes her solidify her <br/>
thoughts on any given subject.  At first I understood, but I have come <br/>
to realize that being with other like-minded people is strengthening.  <br/>
Having support is not weak. Having support is comfort and being <br/>
outnumbered or surrounded by &#39;crazy&#39; people can be so isolating!<br/>
<br/>
I am glad to be a member of this list where we share ideas and support <br/>
for raising and allowing learning for children.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone for being here.<br/>
<br/>
