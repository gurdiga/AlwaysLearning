<div id="ygrps-yiv-7745544">Hi everyone.  I&#39;ve been a member of this list for a few years now.  <br/>
I&#39;ve definitely been more of a read and lurk type, I guess!  I&#39;ve <br/>
enjoyed so many of the posts, along with the thoughtful and at times <br/>
thought provoking responses from members.<br/>
<br/>
I spoke with Sandra ahead of creating this post because I am looking <br/>
for some help out there in the world of unschooling.  I&#39;d like to <br/>
find a nanny to live with our family for preferably a year.  I&#39;ve had <br/>
a live-in nanny helping me out the last couple of years and it has <br/>
been a great help with our current circumstances.  But I would love <br/>
to have a nanny who gets unschooling and our family lifestyle.  While <br/>
our past nannies have done their best to learn and abide by our <br/>
philosophy, I&#39;ve still often felt I had to defend our choices and <br/>
lifestyle.  Before I describe the position, let me give you a brief <br/>
intro into our family:<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I have three children, ages 10, 7 and 2 ½.  I began <br/>
first homeschooling my daughter when she was 4, after trying some <br/>
preschool.  She liked preschool okay, but I just had too much fun <br/>
with her to send her off to school and given a choice she wanted to <br/>
stay home with me too.  I had considered homeschooling even while <br/>
pregnant with her.  So after just a mediocre school experience, I <br/>
decided to go for it and took her out.  I switched to unschooling <br/>
within 6 months after reading John Holt and visiting Sandra&#39;s site--- <br/>
thanks Sandra!  Wow, did unschooling resonate with me.  The idea of <br/>
allowing her to learn how, what, where and when she wanted to learn, <br/>
without deciding for her or coercing or judging her choices, made a <br/>
lot of sense.  It has been so great and I&#39;ve enjoyed watching her <br/>
learn to read and develop a love of reading on her own and become <br/>
amazingly computer savvy, among others.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling didn&#39;t unfold so easily with Ian, at age 7.  He is, based <br/>
on diagnosis, moderately to severely autistic.  He can talk, but <br/>
sticks to single words and doesn&#39;t converse with us or answer <br/>
questions.  He doesn&#39;t easily engage with others, but prefers to play <br/>
alone.  His likes to bang toys and objects together, like shoes, <br/>
drumsticks, blocks, books, etc.  He will circle and gallop around the <br/>
room when he does this and hum and squeal and make all sorts of <br/>
interesting noises.  He can do this for hours a day.  He&#39;s quite <br/>
sensitive to noises and smells and can get easily overwhelmed and <br/>
frustrated and will vent by throwing things, banging his head, <br/>
chewing on his shirt and sometimes breaking household items.  He has <br/>
a fantastic smile and likes to be tickled and will often, out of <br/>
nowhere, give us hugs. <br/>
<br/>
I did try some school for Ian because that&#39;s where the speech and <br/>
occupational services were once he reached the age of three.  We did <br/>
part time preschool for about 6 months.  My heart wasn&#39;t there <br/>
though.  And they just didn&#39;t handle his needs appropriately, but <br/>
looked at him as just some big behavior problem.  I took him out to <br/>
work with him at home.  We had our third car garage converted to a <br/>
giant playroom for him.  The therapy program we use with Ian is <br/>
called Son-Rise.  If you want to learn more, we have a website <br/>
describing it all:  www.iansplace.net<br/>
<br/>
I felt in the beginning that doing therapy with Ian sort of went <br/>
against this whole unschooling philosophy that I so embraced.  But <br/>
Son-Rise to me is in a way very unschooly.  The therapy is based on <br/>
going with the child, not forcing them to do what you want.  So many <br/>
therapies are based on modifying an autistic child&#39;s behavior and <br/>
stopping them from doing all that quirky, repetitive stimming (like <br/>
Ian&#39;s tapping and banging things together).  With Son-Rise I actually <br/>
join Ian when he plays this way.  So if Ian is banging two sticks <br/>
together and galloping with glee around the room, I do it too.  I <br/>
support his choice and don&#39;t put a value judgment on what he chooses <br/>
to do.  Since joining and playing with Ian on his terms, I&#39;ve found <br/>
that he his more flexible and open to then playing with me.  He makes <br/>
more attempts to connect with me in turn.  Having his own playroom <br/>
space also helps with Ian&#39;s sensitivitiesI can control the noise, <br/>
the smells and there are no other kids to mess with his stuff and <br/>
vice versa.  <br/>
<br/>
Then, my youngest, Adam came on the scene 2.5 years ago and.well, it <br/>
got to be pretty challenging around here.  Ian didn&#39;t like the baby <br/>
and still doesn&#39;t really care to have Adam around.  I&#39;ve needed one-<br/>
on-one supervision for both boys since Adam was born.  Ian has been <br/>
known to push, shove and sit down on top of his little brother.  So <br/>
when Adam was born, that&#39;s when I first got a nanny.  I couldn&#39;t be <br/>
with Ian in his playroom and care for the needs of a newborn at the <br/>
same time and also spend time with Julia, as well.  <br/>
<br/>
Having a nanny has been such a cool experience.  It really allows me <br/>
to continue our unschooling lifestyle.  It has been quite a learning <br/>
experience sharing our home with another person and putting our <br/>
values and way of life out there for scrutiny!  And now I want to <br/>
find an unschooling nanny!!! <br/>
 <br/>
My current nanny is leaving at the end of June 2009 (his year <br/>
contract is up).  I&#39;ve begun my search to replace him and thought it <br/>
would be great to have a nanny who understands and embraces <br/>
unschooling.  I&#39;m looking to have someone for a year.  I will do 6 <br/>
months, for the right person.  I would prefer 18 years of age or <br/>
older. The position is basically 40 hours a week, paid overtime, with <br/>
weekends off, 2 weeks of paid vacation a year.  Room and board is <br/>
included, along with a weekly stipend (negotiable).  The nanny will <br/>
have their own furnished bedroom with private bath and television.  <br/>
We also, have wireless internet.  I will consider a male or female <br/>
nanny.  My current nanny is a man and he&#39;s worked out great.  We call <br/>
him the MANny!  <br/>
<br/>
I currently have a profile of our family and our nanny position on a <br/>
nanny finding website called Great AuPair.  You can learn more about <br/>
my nanny position by checking it out here:  <br/>

some pictures of the kids on there too.<br/>
<br/>
I know my post was rather long, but I wanted to give you a little <br/>
glimpse into our family and situation.  If you are interested or know <br/>

Best Wishes,<br/>
