<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And now it&#39;s <br/>
&gt; getting really close to time to leave for Saskatoon and I&#39;m getting nervous<br/>
&gt; and scattery.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sandra!  You&#39;ll be great.  I listened to that tape you sent, &quot;To Question or<br/>
Not to Question&quot; and it was wonderful.  Talk like that, and you&#39;ll get them<br/>
really thinking.<br/>
<br/>
You know, they don&#39;t have to like you.  It&#39;s ok if they don&#39;t, really.  I&#39;m<br/>
sure they have enough tact to not run you out of town.  And if they don&#39;t<br/>
like you, that dislike may irritate them into thinking about you and what<br/>
you said.  Over time, that may do more to change their children&#39;s lives for<br/>
the better than any speaker they hear there and agree with.<br/>
<br/>
Sand in the oyster makes a pearl.  Water doesn&#39;t irritate the oyster at all,<br/>
but just washes through.<br/>
<br/>
Have a GOOD time.  (Stay warm!)<br/>

<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
I can&#39;t do that one without Richard!<br/>
But I&#39;ll listen to it myself, maybe on the way, and see what I can work into <br/>
the talk about having confidence in oneself.<br/>
<br/>
Good idea.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;You know, they don&#39;t have to like you.  It&#39;s ok if they don&#39;t, really.  I&#39;m<br/>
sure they have enough tact to not run you out of town.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I hope. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve already arranged for an outside ride to the airport, though (just in <br/>
case &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve considered that I might not be so well received, but it&#39;s not the sort <br/>
of conference where they have the same speakers over, so whether the love me <br/>
or not, this is a one-shot and that&#39;s okay.  I&#39;ll just do my best.<br/>
<br/>
Kids aren&#39;t allowed at the conference.   *sigh*<br/>
Nursing babies only.<br/>
Probably I&#39;m glad.  I&#39;m afraid I&#39;d be witnessing more &quot;disciplining&quot; than I <br/>
can stomach anymore.<br/>

Oh. TALK like THAT.<br/>
I need to read better.  I&#39;m drinking tea and waking up.  Soon I might be <br/>
smart.<br/>
It doesn&#39;t feel like it today, though.  It&#39;s overcast and my hands feel <br/>
sleepy.<br/>
