<div id="ygrps-yiv-1164504138">I hope this is an appropriate thing to post on this list.  My sister is<br/>
pregnant and a friend of hers gave her &quot;Baby Wise&quot; to read when the baby<br/>
comes.  I had only heard about this book before, but last weekend I was at<br/>
her house and had the chance to skim it.  OMG!  It was one of those books<br/>
you want to keep reading, only out of morbid curiosity.  Do people really<br/>
follow this stuff?  I only read the FIRST chapter, and was literally arguing<br/>
out loud with the book (people were staring) during my sister&#39;s party.  And<br/>
later, when I asked my sister what she thought about it, she said &quot;It&#39;s<br/>
okay.  So far there is nothing that I don&#39;t agree with in the book.&quot;  She<br/>
was on chapter 6!!!!<br/>
<br/>
So, first I want to say that reading that book, actually made me see how far<br/>
I&#39;ve come on this unschooling journey.  But secondly, what can I do about my<br/>
sister????  Normally, I&#39;d be on the phone with her loudly voicing my<br/>
opinion.  (It took all I had to not say anything to her.)  However, I&#39;ve<br/>
heard people on this list complain about how annoying and pointless it is<br/>
for relatives to tell them that the way they chose to parent and educate is<br/>
wrong.  When I was about to send my sister a link to an anti-baby wise site,<br/>
I stopped, and thought of you all.   I wouldn&#39;t want her sending me an<br/>
anti-unschooling link  (is there even one?) and telling me how my way of<br/>
parenting is wrong.  But it really bothers me that she is going to put her<br/>
poor little newborn on a feeding schedule, and let him cry and cry and cry!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This doesn&#39;t really have anything to do with unschooling, I guess.  But I<br/>
was wondering what anyone&#39;s thoughts on this was, since you all can probably<br/>
understand my difficult situation more than anyone else.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;How about saying &quot;I&#39;ve been reading a lot about how damaging Baby  <br/>
Wise is. It seems to work in the short run when kids are easy to  <br/>
control but has negative effects in the future when things get  <br/>
harder. I have some books and articles if you&#39;d like to read them  <br/>
about Baby Wise and about other methods that don&#39;t have the same  <br/>
effect. And if you&#39;d like to talk, I&#39;d love to.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And then drop it. Sew the seed. Let her come to you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1560849585">Just an idea: <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know of any book titles to recommend  because I didn&#39;t read any &quot;how to&quot; baby books 14 years ago, but if there is a great book out there, you could offer one as a gift and just say you came across this book and thought she might enjoy reading it.  Wrap it up in special packaging: beautiful gift wrap, bow, etc and make it a gift from your heart.  So she will see it that way perhaps?<br/>
<br/>
Never mention you have a concern about the other book - or disagree with the other book as that might put her on the defensive - it was a gift too and not something she chose to purchase and read.  But if she thinks the experts say such and such is best she may buy into it just because it&#39;s in the only book she has read.<br/>
<br/>
As said &quot;Plant the seeds.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1471049851">i have not introduced myself yet, and i will do that soon - however i wanted to respond to this, as the babywise books/system has come under *wide* scrutiny an there is a web site dedicated to exposing the background and risks - you might just send her the web site, saying you were worried when you saw the book because of everything that is on the site - it is not only counter to everything unschooling, it is downright dangerous - babies have been failure to thrive under this program,  and the ezzos (authors) were kicked out of their church for what they were promoting.  babywise is the secular version of &quot;preparation for parenting - growing kids god&#39;s way&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
on the site is a trifold brochure, which you could just send her if the site will be too overwhelming....<br/>
<br/>
there are also a bunch of &quot;anti-ezzo&quot; quotes/testimony from those who wish they had known BEFORE they gave birth...<br/>
<br/>
note: DON&#39;t send her to ezzoinfo.com  - that is actually the ezzo&#39;s site! (i discovered from looking for this link for you!):<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ezzo.info/index.htm">http://www.ezzo.info/index.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
oh, and be careful  - depending how indoctrinated she is, there is info in the book about what to say/how to deal with people who warn them about the program - veyr cultish in that way.  really isolates new mothers - just what they need!<br/>
<br/>
hope this helps...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1967607286">Have you shared any of your favorite parenting/baby books with her yet? <br/>
Or suggested that she check out LaLeche League? If she&#39;s serious about <br/>
breastfeeding, the practices in Baby Wise won&#39;t help her be <br/>
successful.  <br/>
<br/>
A nice first book -- granted not as radical as like, but a good bridge <br/>
from traditional to attachment parenting -- is The Baby Book, by <br/>
William Sears who is affiliated with LaLeche League (his wife was a <br/>
founder of LLL).<br/>
<br/>
Everyday Blessings, The Inner Work of Mindful Parenting is another good <br/>
one, but it is very buddhist in nature, so maybe not great if your <br/>
sister is a practicing Christian. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll bet you could also find some anti-Baby Wise info online that&#39;s <br/>
not &#39;radical&#39; in nature, but still conveys how dangerous Baby Wise (any <br/>
book by Ezzo, really) is to children.  You might look for stories about <br/>
Ezzo and his books in mainstream mags like Time or Parents Magazine.<br/>

little baby book&quot; to name one), but because it was written in such<br/>

It would be an EXCELLENT book to give her......<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1442822720">I think my favorite book is &quot;25 things every new mother should know&quot; by Martha Sears.  It is very quick to read, and really has a simple message--trust yourself.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; A nice first book -- granted not as radical as like, but a good bridge<br/>
&gt; &gt; from traditional to attachment parenting -- is The Baby Book, by<br/>
&gt; &gt; William Sears who is affiliated with LaLeche League (his wife was a<br/>
&gt; &gt; founder of LLL).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Great suggestions so far! Dr. Sears&#39; books always seem to come across<br/>
&gt; as very non-threatening to mothers who may not be familiar with the<br/>
&gt; attachment parenting style. Also wanted to add that Sears&#39; wife isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; one of the LLL founders, although she and her husband are very<br/>
&gt; popular in LLL circles. The seven women who did found LLL did so 50<br/>
&gt; years ago, which probably makes her a little too young. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2086031498">Kim - I have always really liked the books by Dr. Sears and his wife,<br/>
Martha.  They have been helpful and supportive when so many books are<br/>
like the one you&#39;ve mentioned.  I cannot imagine letting any baby or<br/>
child, but especially a newborn, just cry.  They cry for a reason.  I<br/>
have had this debate with many moms who belive that their babies should<br/>
immediately conform to their (the mom&#39;s) schedules or desires.  I tell<br/>
them to imagine being torn from their first comfort zones, all warm and<br/>
fed and cozy, and thrust into aloneness, hungry and scared and helpless.<br/>
Most cannot even imagine themselves in this situation, yet think it okay<br/>
to let their little precious babies be there.  UGH!!!  My little one,<br/>
who is 2 and 1/2, is currently on a sleep protest.  He&#39;s still a nursing<br/>
baby and wants to nurse a lot at night.  He wakes latel at 2 am and is<br/>
up for hours.  I do not let him cry, do not leave him to himself..  We<br/>
rock, we sing, we nurse, whatever.  Poor little things cannot help what<br/>
their bodies need at 2 am!  I am ready, though, for whatever<br/>
developmental phase this is to pass!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, here is the link to Dr. Sears&#39; site and another site I really<br/>
like.  I hope your sister melts when she holds her baby the first time<br/>
so much that she cannot imagine letting such a tiny little creature cry<br/>
it out  Get her a couple of the Sears books for a shower gift or<br/>
hospital care package.  Anyone can write a baby book and call themselves<br/>
an expert -- look at Marilu Henner & insert eye-roll here.  Good luck<br/>
planting those seeds!<br/>

<br/>
This is what I&#39;m hoping for!  My sister is so protective of her cats (We<br/>
call her the &quot;crazy cat lady!&quot;)  So we can&#39;t really imagine her putting Baby<br/>
Wise into action, if she were to be true to herself.  The problem is that<br/>
her friends and husband highly influence her, and I wouldn&#39;t really call any<br/>
of them &quot;attached&quot; parents.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all SO much for your ideas and references!   I just bought The<br/>
Baby Book and No Cry Sleep Solution for my sister.  We&#39;ll see how that<br/>
goes.  And thank you to the several people who referenced Ezzo&#39;s website.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1306186618">Good, I was just about to suggest the No Cry Sleep Solution. A nice <br/>
sling (we liked the Moby Wrap for our newborn) would be a good gift <br/>
too. Plus I would make sure she knows what lactation help she has <br/>
available to her beforehand. It&#39;s important to know that a) hospitals <br/>
really push formula, which is not necessary or good for almost all <br/>
babies, and b) it&#39;s the number of times you nurse, not the length, that <br/>
helps you make enough milk. Schedules can limit your ability to feed <br/>
your child enough. I&#39;d email her a link to kellymom.com too. <br/>
<br/>
Best wishes!<br/>
