<div id="ygrps-yiv-1212822944">My sister made me tear up today.  (I&#39;ll get to that below)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I was just reading on one of the unschooling lists recently about how people<br/>
on these lists keep in giving despite the mean emails they get sometimes. I<br/>
think it is a gift that you all give when you keep on keeping on despite<br/>
those mean emails.  I can&#39;t thank you all enough.   I used to be more vocal<br/>
locally about unschooling/parenting but I stopped because the nasty-grams I<br/>
occasionally got really brought me down and I didn&#39;t&#39; want to be stressed.<br/>
I wanted to be in the present enjoying my kids.  Anyway, I miss the positive<br/>
reinforcement that I would get sometimes  from sharing our way of life<br/>
publicly.  It is very satisfying to know you changed some child&#39;s life for<br/>
the better by sharing your own story.  Anyway, I got a pat on the back today<br/>
from my sister from something she posted on facebook called 25 things about<br/>
me.  (you write 25 things about yourself that you share with your friends.)<br/>
This is what she wrote and you guys get some of the credit for it because<br/>
you have really helped to shape my as a parent and person with what you have<br/>
shared over the years.  :-)  Thanks!  Angela<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;I cherish my sister&#39;s wisdom re: children, education, and life in general.<br/>
She reminds me to live/parent for today, not tomorrow.&gt;<br/>

Even people who lash out and tell me I suck or who blatantly wish me  <br/>
ill don&#39;t actually cause me harm.  And some of them do become better  <br/>
parents, even if they&#39;d never let me know in a hundred years.  (Some  <br/>
have told me, so I assume there are others.  Even if none had told me,  <br/>
human nature tends to say &quot;NO&quot; and then maybe yes later.)<br/>

Yes.  And if you  share why you think your home is so peaceful and  <br/>
fun, you make it possible for others to learn about unschooling, or at  <br/>
least you give them permission to be nicer parents.  Some people bite  <br/>
when they&#39;d rather leave things the same say they are.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Exactly!  When I get in those moments, the best and most wonderful thing<br/>
for me to do is to turn and face the other direction.  Face my kids,<br/>
turn towards their wonderfulness!  It&#39;s interesting too, because when I<br/>
don&#39;t do that, they actually absorb my angst, so it&#39;s doubly wonderful<br/>
to turn and face my kids, because it helps me regain my happy center and<br/>
they maintain their happy center!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1477325999">So many people look askance or come right out and say they&#39;re doubtful about<br/>
how I&#39;m parenting Karl that it might make me doubt it myself if it weren&#39;t<br/>
for Karl.  He is doing so well ...  swimmingly, even when everything isn&#39;t<br/>
swimmingly.  I&#39;m perfectly happy with the thought that it&#39;s due to Karl<br/>
rather than me though.  :D  I do credit unschooling a great deal for how<br/>
well things are going with our family.  That is so worth the unfounded<br/>
commentary.  It&#39;s hilarious.<br/>

All three of my sisters-in-law have become more vocal about how they have<br/>
become more gentle in their parenting.  This is a recent development.<br/>
Before me and Brian broke up for 1 1/2 years all but one were very vocal<br/>
about the punitive measures they used with the nine children between them,<br/>
all told.  When I lived with one of those sisters-in-law, there was a lot of<br/>
comment about how lax my parenting was/is, and I rarely said much (in order<br/>
to avoid adding to the noise) unless it was to help Karl get what he<br/>
wanted/needed, at least some of the time... like ensuring that he wasn&#39;t<br/>
forced to eat things he didn&#39;t want.  That sister-in-law is phasing out<br/>
spanking with all of her 5 boys, which was a nightly ritual as late as last<br/>
year.  I guess the proof&#39;s in the pudding, so to speak.  We have never<br/>
spanked Karl and the drudgery of nightly spankings perhaps has struck them<br/>
as completely unnecessary.  I haven&#39;t heard any conversations about changes<br/>
in their parenting.  Mum&#39;s the word.  I don&#39;t mind.  Their secret&#39;s safe<br/>
with me.  And I&#39;m happy the kids are somewhat more relaxed these days.  ;)<br/>

<br/>
The reason I know my sisters-in-law have become more vocal about being<br/>
gentler with their kids is through their conversations with Brian which he<br/>
sometimes relates to me.<br/>
<br/>
There.  Hope that makes more sense.<br/>
