<div id="ygrps-yiv-1681769657">The other day Chamille was reading over my shoulder about freedom,<br/>
something Sandra wrote.  Since people have been talking about this idea<br/>
recently here, I thought I&#39;d put out there what Chamille said.  It was<br/>
very simple and concise, she said that parents can&#39;t give their children<br/>
freedom, but they could give them free will.  I&#39;m certain it wasn&#39;t<br/>
phrased in that way, but with that general meaning.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking about it ever since she said it, turning it around in<br/>
my head over and over.  It&#39;s definitely related to freedom, but free<br/>
will involves choices of what one does with the freedom they have.  <br/>
Upon looking up &quot;free will&quot; in wikipedia, you can see how philosophers<br/>
have hashed this idea out over the years.<br/>
<br/>
I told someone once that her choice to force church on her daughter<br/>
wasn&#39;t extending the &quot;free will&quot; that God gave her, to her daughter. <br/>
The very fact that kids aren&#39;t seen as people is glaring wether or not<br/>
you believe in God or going to church.<br/>
<br/>
An unschooling parent can allow their children free will, and children<br/>
can run with it making both good and bad choices and learning from each<br/>
and every one of them.  And an unschooling parent can create a framework<br/>
in which free will can be a part of life without making it a free for<br/>
all, as in, do whatever you want, I don&#39;t care because you have the<br/>
freedom to do so.</div>

<br/>
Here are some yardsticks  I used...<br/>
<br/>
Do you offer lots of help, advice, love, hugs?  Are you family&#39;s basic needs<br/>
being met--food, shelter, clothing?<br/>
<br/>
alternately...some tongue in cheek questions...<br/>
Have you gone into debt purchasing things you could not afford, jeopardizing<br/>
your financial well-being and your house is being auctioned off by<br/>
creditors?    Did the seven year old get a permanent tattoo that he/she drew<br/>
on themselves using discarded needles they found in a park they frequent<br/>
alone?  Does everyone still have all their original equipment--nobody had<br/>
anything amputated by chainsaws they explored on their own?  None of the<br/>
children have moved out and are panhandling for money?  Are social<br/>
workers/police officers knocking on your door because your children are on a<br/>
robbing spree?  Is one of the children selling off bathtub gin, leftover<br/>
from his/her science experiment?<br/>
<br/>
Just wondering what you mean by out of control,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s just it though, you had the freedom to do what you wanted.  My<br/>
husband could potentially buy a new car tomorrow.  He has the freedom to<br/>
do so and his own free will to make that decision.  I know he will not<br/>
make decisions like that without thinking first about how it affects<br/>
everyone else and talking to me about it.  Some kids are really<br/>
responsible with their choices and some need help with making any<br/>
choices.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s about drawing lines, it&#39;s more about presenting a<br/>
path of choices and accepting the chosen path and then helping the child<br/>
along it.  When a child wakes up in the morning, they are immediately<br/>
presented with choices, do I stay in bed, do I stay in bed and watch tv,<br/>
do I get up and go to the bathroom, do I stay up, do I then get dressed,<br/>
do I stay in my pj&#39;s, do I go get some breakfast, do I ask someone to<br/>
get me breakfast, do I sit on the couch or the floor or at the kitchen<br/>
table?<br/>
<br/>
Some kids get up at 7 am sharp and get dressed with a parent chosen<br/>
outfit, go directly to the breakfast table and then off to summer camp<br/>
after they&#39;ve brushed their teeth and their hair and put on the<br/>
appropriate parent chosen shoes.  If you aren&#39;t doing that, then you,<br/>
the parent, have chosen to give your child some freedom in which they<br/>
can use their free will to live in.   If the parent still believes that<br/>
comfort and food are a good thing, they&#39;ll find a way to present some<br/>
comfort and food as really desirable options to choose from.<br/>
<br/>
The other day, Margaux was getting ready to go out with me to the store.<br/>
It was chilly in the house, but I knew that it was already in the upper<br/>
80 degrees outside and so I let her know and suggested that she pick<br/>
shorts and short sleeves and put on a sweater.  She refused to do so. <br/>
It wasn&#39;t worth arguing about or making a big deal about.  I&#39;d given her<br/>
the information she needed to know and helped her put on her long pants<br/>
and long sleeved shirt.  We left and she was hot, I helped her roll up<br/>
her pant legs and long sleeves, and she was comfortable in the stores<br/>
with air conditioning.  As soon as we got home, she changed her<br/>
clothing.  It would have been nice if she hadn&#39;t beem hot and irritated,<br/>
but that small amount of hot and irritation was small compared to how<br/>
she would&#39;ve reacted to me forcing her to wear something that she didn&#39;t<br/>
want to wear.<br/>
<br/>
If we had been going to the playground to play for many hours, there are<br/>
many things that I would&#39;ve done to make things go well for Margaux and<br/>
her clothing choice.  That, I suppose would be the frame work.  I<br/>
would&#39;ve packed alternate clothing and cool drinks and food and a park<br/>
with shade.  I want her to be able to choose what she wants to wear, to<br/>
make those kinds of decisions for herself, but since I also value<br/>
comfort, I&#39;ll make sure that those are options too.  I don&#39;t have to do<br/>
that though, I could go and let her suffer through her choice.  Just<br/>
like I could let her be mean to other children on the playground without<br/>
jumping in and smoothing things out.</div>
