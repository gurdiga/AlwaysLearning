<div id="ygrps-yiv-450113596">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I am a big fan of John Holt and unschooling. It&#39;s simply amazing <br/>
what my four-year-old has learned without anyone actively teaching <br/>
her.<br/>
<br/>
But I find that the notion of unschooling makes me very protective <br/>
of her self-directed learning, and so when others attempt <br/>
traditional instruction, I end up acting like a schoolteacher.<br/>
<br/>
Example, my mom will tell my daughter, &quot;You have to learn how to <br/>
hold a pen the right way,&quot; or she&#39;ll babysit and drill her by just <br/>
writing unrelated words on a piece of paper and having my daughter <br/>
read them (when daughter can already read books, email from me, <br/>
etc.).<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;ll end up constantly correcting my mom. Exactly what I don&#39;t <br/>
want her to do to my daughter. It&#39;s kind of weird and I wonder if <br/>
anyone else has found a more consistent way of dealing with these <br/>
types of things.<br/>
<br/>
A better way to unschool chronic schoolers...?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
Danny</div>

That&#39;s not your job.<br/>
If they don&#39;t want to learn about unschooling, that&#39;s fine.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Your job is to protect your daughter&#39;s natural learning environment.<br/>
