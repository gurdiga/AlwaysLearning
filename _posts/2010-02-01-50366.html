<div id="ygrps-yiv-1255685908">I always wanted to have children. From a very young age all I had talked about was having children. I never ever planned on sending my Children to school.  I have tried several school programs (ACE, SOS,LifePac and now Abeka) They hate I hate I feel like I am pushing school and I want them to love it But I want to be sure they are learning what they need to be up to grade level. <br/>
My husband hates it when I let them have a hands on day. He says thats not school.  I think they learn best with hands on I don&#39;t know what to do. Please any suggestions will be greatly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Thank-you<br/>

There&#39;s your problem. You haven&#39;t left school.  You&#39;re living in the  <br/>
shadow of school.<br/>

<br/>
Right.  School is school.  Send them to school if he wants school.   <br/>
Talk him out of school if you don&#39;t want school.<br/>
<br/>
By &quot;hands on&quot; I&#39;m guessing you mean actually doing things other than  <br/>
reading from a textbook or workbook and doing worksheets.  Nobody on  <br/>
this list is likely to defend &quot;schoolwork,&quot; so all you can see here is  <br/>
learning from doing, being, talking, etc.<br/>

<br/>
I guess it depends on what school he has envisioned.  Some schools are more like that than others.  Some people pay extra to have their kids in schools that are MORE like that.  You are doing it for less, I imagine.  Perhaps that should be the talking point... what is and is not school and how it should look at home.<br/>
