&gt; She probably had no hope of enough to make her happy, just maybe enough to <br/>
&gt; allow her to sleep six hours at a stretch, not to have diarrhea every time <br/>
&gt; she thought about her husband, or not to wish a bus would just hit her hard <br/>
&gt; and have it all end.<br/>

twenty years, and she&#39;s always been in &quot;crisis&quot;, I couldn&#39;t see a way out of <br/>
it that easily (meaning the medication).<br/>
<br/>
As to the earlier e-mail - no, that isn&#39;t my only criteria for friendships, <br/>
male or female, but at this point in my life it is too hard to get involved <br/>
with someone who is seriously depressed.  I am still friends with all of <br/>
these people, but unwilling to be the &quot;mother&quot; that they thought I could be <br/>
to them.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t take any of it lightly, having a son that tried to commit suicide, <br/>
and was brought back to his &quot;normal&quot; way of life by the help of drugs.<br/>
<br/>
As much as I love the e-mail dialogue often many parts of the story go by the <br/>
unspoken.<br/>
