&lt;&lt; It started off talking about the &quot;Book Matches&quot; of<br/>
grain you describe in this post &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!  I never knew the name for it.<br/>
<br/>
At our old house, pre-kids, we had a roommate with jumping boxers (dogs, <br/>
y&#39;know) and so he and Keith put up a verticle-slat fence on frames, really <br/>
high.  Cinder-block wall 6&#39; tall, so they raised this wall up so it started <br/>
about three feet up and went up about nine or ten feet.<br/>
<br/>
It didn&#39;t keep the jumpingest dog in.<br/>
<br/>
But the story is that it was made of some weird odd wood the lumber yard had <br/>
wanted to get rid of--the last of a custom job.  They were odd-shaped boards, <br/>
like 1x6, and each was made of a sliced 2x6, and they came stacked carefully, <br/>
and the guys put them up carefully.  So with no other benefit to the world, <br/>
each two were &quot;book matched&quot;!    All the way around the back yard, sets of <br/>
two mirror-matching boards.  <br/>
<br/>
Cheap thrills, but fun to look at, and as we had little kids they all <br/>
&quot;discovered&quot; it.<br/>
