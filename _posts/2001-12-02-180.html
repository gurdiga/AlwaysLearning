&gt;<br/>
&gt; Do they have to be &quot;real writers,&quot; or can they be people here?<br/>

of the real writing, too.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Would you feel better having a bought book in your math section than just<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was thinking of it as more of a complementary thing.   I try the ideas here; I&#39;d<br/>
also like to snuggle up with a good book.  I can read and reread a book and come<br/>
back to it over time.  I can sleep on a single idea, or find out more about it, or<br/>
take a month (or years) away and go back to it and see how my ideas have changed,<br/>
or how I understand more or differently.  I can ask somebody else to read it and<br/>
we can talk about it.<br/>
<br/>
Threads on email lists move on and spread out, and I can&#39;t seem to catch up with<br/>
or savour ideas.   I feel rushed into sorting, sifting and responding off the top<br/>
of my head.  Perhaps this will change as I adapt to this method of communicating.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
**********  ***********<br/>
I&#39;m trying to think through &quot;Keith&#39;s notes&quot;.  There&#39;s a lot in there to take in:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Math is a highly structured abstract modeling tool and requires a strong<br/>
sense of discipline, but ...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 I&#39;m trying to figure out what an &quot;abstract modeling tool&quot; is. I&#39;d been thinking<br/>
that the purpose of mathematical modeling is to make the abstract a little more<br/>
concrete.  I can&#39;t yet make sense of this. It&#39;ll take some time and maybe further<br/>
input from others.<br/>
<br/>
With a book I can take the time, or ask others privately, or look for other<br/>
resources,  if I still don&#39;t get it. I&#39;m so slow with it that I&#39;ll feel like a<br/>
dope if figure it out and bring it up on the list a couple of months from now.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;A true math student must possess a strong passion for discovery in a realm<br/>
which has little direct connection to the world of our five senses.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But right now, I think, or I believe, that I can only discover the world through<br/>
my five senses.<br/>
What or where is this realm which is mostly indirectly connected to the world I<br/>
know?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Think of your everyday actions, then look at how<br/>
they can be represented with math.  Scaling of cooking ingredients (ratios),<br/>
boiling water (physics or chemistry), bouncing a ball (physics), watching<br/>
the moon circle the earth (geometry), (as in why does a ball fall to earth<br/>
but the moon does not?).  Find art with a protractor, compass, straight<br/>
edge, (like the Greeks) or just play with graph paper (geometry & trig).<br/>
Look for symetry in nature or man made artifacts (ratios again).  Look for<br/>
applications of fractions (ratios, division, combinatorics).  Talk about the<br/>
lottery or statistics in elections or sports.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So is math the tool to create models of these real world things so that you can<br/>
generalize from a real situation to an abstract or imagined situation?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*************   *********************<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So will having more books with words about math help a family in which<br/>
&gt; patterns don&#39;t jump out and dance?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know.  Maybe books with illustrations of dancing patterns (and words about<br/>
why it&#39;s math) would help .<br/>
<br/>
For some families, patterns  jump out and dance. Some members of our family seem<br/>
to need to dance the patterns themselves, but the patterns are still jumping out.<br/>
<br/>
***************  ******************<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The original charge here that some libraries have no books on math is really<br/>
&gt; interesting.  Math doesn&#39;t come in words very well.  I have a couple of<br/>
&gt; &quot;books on music&quot; which have no written-out music, and have no CD or record or<br/>
&gt; tape, and have few pictures, just words.  They&#39;re WEIRD, even those I know<br/>
&gt; lots about.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m getting that words don&#39;t communicate math very well and as we can&#39;t experience<br/>
music through words, we also can&#39;t experience math through words.<br/>
<br/>
Someone who can&#39;t read musical notation, though,  is still able to listen to the<br/>
music, recognize it as music and be moved by it.  They won&#39;t &quot;get it&quot; with the<br/>
same depth a musician would, but they&#39;ll catch something.<br/>
<br/>
The notation for math is--numbers, graphs and lines?  Or only for some math?<br/>
Can someone who can&#39;t read math notation still experience the beauty of it and be<br/>
moved by it?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;ll take up the suggestions I&#39;ve found here and lurk some more.<br/>
<br/>

P.S.  I used the phrase &quot;supply teaching&quot; in my last post.  It&#39;s just another name<br/>
for substitute or occasional teaching.</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re thinking that math is one thing - that it can be described as having <br/>
&quot;a&quot; purpose. There are lots of pre-planned or hoped-for or unexpected <br/>
real-world applications of things thought up by people who really were just <br/>
&quot;playing around&quot; with ideas in a purely abstract realm.  Does that help at <br/>
all?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes.  That&#39;s what I was trying to say but I didn&#39;t say it as succinctly.<br/>
<br/>
Someone can feel the patterns dancing, and think in that &quot;music&quot; and BE <br/>
mathematically minded and still not read mathematical notation.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m positive that the notation will make more sense to someone who knows <br/>
what math-music sounds like AFTER they&#39;re familiar with it than if you just <br/>
try to start (as school does) with the notation itself, as though the <br/>
notation IS math; as though musical notes on paper WERE music.  They are not. <br/>
 They&#39;re a graph of music, an abstract modeling tool (to borrow Keith&#39;s <br/>
phrase).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Please don&#39;t feel like a dope, and please DO bring it up. You&#39;re not the only one with<br/>
math fears, anxiety, and questions. I always enjoy math discussions on unschooling<br/>
lists.<br/>
<br/>

connects the two. It&#39;s in the difference between fixed expenses and variable expenses<br/>
in running a household or business.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So is math the tool to create models of these real world things so that you can<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Right. Or vice versa. You&#39;re imagining the 9x13&quot; pan and you really have the 9x9&quot; pan.<br/>
You&#39;re imagining the budget and you have the money that needs budgeting. (as you can<br/>
probably tell, I tend to be a very concrete thinker, but also like math)<br/>

feel the same way.  I know my own learning style is slow. Not as in I&#39;m not <br/>
very bright, but as in I take awhile to chew on an idea, accept it or reject <br/>
it, incorporate, dissect, etc. I too feel rushed when I keep up to date on <br/>
these lists. I&#39;ve given up. Now I just read a lot, and process it off list.<br/>
<br/>
Something that boosted my ego was learning the AyurVedic explanation of body <br/>
types. I&#39;m a Kapha which is slow moving, in body and thought. Usually pretty <br/>
calm and slow to learn, also slow to forget. Good at maintaining foundations. <br/>
There are also Pitta and Vata and each has their own pace at life/learning. <br/>
These descriptions have given me a lot of insight into my own self. And it <br/>
helps that now I don&#39;t feel bad going at my own pace. I don&#39;t mind telling <br/>
someone, &quot;Please say that again, a little slower&quot;. Books are also good for me <br/>
because I can stop and process, and pick it up again when I&#39;m ready.<br/>

it thoroughly!<br/>

Absolutely.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been hanging out a lot with a friend from jr. high and on.  We were out <br/>
of contact for years, but now we talk once a month or so for hours.  We go <br/>
back to conversations a month or a year or a decade old, and it&#39;s wonderful.  <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Last night three other families came over for a reunion of our old <br/>
babysitting co-op from when our now-teen kids were toddlers and six and so.  <br/>
It was great to revisit some ideas we had in those ideas and look at them <br/>
again.  And two of the teen girls who DID go to school, both are jrs. now (16 <br/>
or so, second-to-last year, for commonwealth-school readers) needed to go <br/>
home early to work on homework, and were both stressed about school and <br/>
saying they hated it.  One mom reminded her kid that she had always had a <br/>
choice, and she had given her the reminder before school started.  <br/>
<br/>
Most of the kids who were here homeschool.  There were eleven kids here.  It <br/>
was great.  Oh--and Kira from Minneapolis, who wasn&#39;t in the homeschooling <br/>
group, but is a 21 yr old homeschooler of my long acquaintance who stopped <br/>
here on her train-trek around the country.<br/>
<br/>
Taking years to mull over ideas and progress and patterns is a great thing.<br/>
Any old topic is as good as any new topic.<br/>
