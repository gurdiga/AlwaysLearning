<div id="ygrps-yiv-691117702">&quot;I&#39;ll go and put the spam filter back on. Bummer. It means new<br/>
members will have to be individually removed from moderation, but<br/>
it&#39;s better than subjecting the list to all manner of stuff.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Did you know you can delete a specific message, then put just that <br/>
member on moderation?<br/>
I did that to this exact poster over at Live and Learn...she&#39;s <br/>
apparently hitting up unschooling lists this week.<br/>
That way, you don&#39;t have to filter through every new member. Just a <br/>
thought.<br/>

though the msg was exactly the same.  I think they (the SPAMers) cycle<br/>
different ids, and rarely use the same one more than once.<br/>

Sure, but by then the damage is done.  I think that&#39;s the third  <br/>
spammer in as many months, and we&#39;re trying to keep a peaceful quiet  <br/>
nappish little group here. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
(I don&#39;t mind it not being quiet, and even &quot;peaceful&quot; isn&#39;t required,  <br/>
but it shouldn&#39;t be irritating.<br/>
