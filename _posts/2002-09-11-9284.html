<div id="ygrps-yiv-1275975502">I am an extrovert married to an introvert.  Sometimes we extroverts are <br/>
so bull-headed that we just can&#39;t seem to understand the need for <br/>
introverts to recharge with solitude.  When dh and I were dating, I <br/>
would drag him out to parties and receptions where there would be rooms <br/>
full with people.  To me -- this was a like diving into a huge box of <br/>
chocolate -- and I would plunge right in.  He would gamely try to follow <br/>
me, but I would later find him hugging the wall in some remote corner.   <br/>
At one party there was a huge room -- hundreds of people, lots of <br/>
political celebrities -- and I was in heaven!  I turned to find dh and <br/>
he looked terrible -- green and pasty, clammy and trembling.  He looked <br/>
like he was about to faint.  I realized that he was having a physical <br/>
reaction to the situation -- that was just the opposite of my enjoyment <br/>
of it.  After that, I truly understood that we&#39;re just wired differently.<br/>
<br/>
Dh&#39;s family has told me that after being around me for 15 years, he&#39;s <br/>
become more out-going and participatory. And I&#39;ve been told that I&#39;ve <br/>
become more reflective and quiet.  (Not that I&#39;m all that quiet now -- <br/>
maybe just less &quot;out-there&quot; than I used to be.) I really appreciate the <br/>
introverts in my life because I think they&#39;re better at observing the <br/>
things that I miss while I&#39;m so busy &quot;interacting.&quot;   <br/>

&gt; being<br/>
&gt; with people and having fun, but I reach my limit after a few hours and <br/>
&gt; need<br/>

&gt; read<br/>
&gt; and think my own thoughts.&quot;<br/>

&gt; It was interesting to read that while my basic personality traits are <br/>
&gt; still<br/>
&gt; the same, I accept myself for who I am and I am not afraid or ashamed of<br/>
&gt; needing my quiet times to recharge.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1174986778">My problem with the young woman&#39;s attitude was that while she was acting <br/>
(and probably is?) introverted, she was blaming her parents for her not <br/>
*learning* to be extroverted!  Blaming another entity for one&#39;s own <br/>
personal proclivities pushes my buttons big time and is just plain old not <br/>
good for anybody.  My second problem is that the parents seemed willing to <br/>
take on that blame!  Whoa!<br/>
<br/>
If the young lady thinks it&#39;s possible to *learn* to be more extroverted <br/>
then she should go ahead and try (not that I think it&#39;ll work.)  Otherwise, <br/>
she should lay off of her parents and take some responsibility for her own <br/>
life and actions.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s got nothing to do really with being extro or intro, but everything to <br/>
do with being responsible for your own life and not blaming others for what <br/>
you are or aren&#39;t.<br/>
Harumph!<br/>
...okay, I&#39;ll get off my soapbox now...<br/>
...grump, grump, grump...<br/>
