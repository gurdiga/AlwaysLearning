<div id="ygrps-yiv-1561076247">Not an unschooling story, but the experiences of an avid gamer.<br/>
Anyone with a need for evidence to show critics might want to lift this.<br/>
I arrived today, unsolicited.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra<br/>
===========<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dear Mrs. Sandra Dodd,<br/>
     Thank you for your page on videogames and their many benefits.   <br/>
I am<br/>
a long-time avid gamer; I&#39;ve loved games ever since I got my very first<br/>
NES. While some may believe that games will &quot;rot your brain,&quot; I&#39;m living<br/>
proof to the contrary. I&#39;m now 23, and I still play games. However, in<br/>
the mean time, I have graduated high school with honors and a National<br/>
Honors Society member. I&#39;ve earned a Bachelor of Science degree in<br/>
computer science and engineering, cum laude. I&#39;m currently enrolled in<br/>
law school, and doing quite well. I personally attribute a lot of my<br/>
academic success to video games, and always have. One important lesson<br/>
I&#39;ve learned is how to budget my time effectively. Video games also<br/>
serve as an important release from the stress created by such rigorous<br/>
study. Also, I believe each and every game teaches important educational<br/>
concepts indirectly (e.g. reading comprehension, logic and mathematics<br/>
through puzzle solving, hand-eye coordination, etc.)  I&#39;m very<br/>
supportive of parents who get gaming systems for their kids, and I hate<br/>
it when I hear how games are &quot;destroying&quot; our youth.  I hope many<br/>
parents read your page and make use of it!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
Brian</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1746062503">I wanted to say too that years back when I was first involve in  <br/>
homeschooling discussions, the best things most people had ever heard  <br/>
or could come up with to defend video games was &quot;It helps with hand/ <br/>
eye coordination.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It was asserted seriously, as though that were all it could possibly do.<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s as smallminded as saying tennis helps with eye/hand  <br/>
coordination, or oil painting helps with eye hand coordination, or  <br/>
playing an instrument formally (reading music and playing a clarinet  <br/>
say, or piano or cello) &quot;improves eye/hand coordination.&quot;<br/>

There is another thought, too, that might not be taken well by all,  <br/>

see any benefit even after watching a chid play (or worse, who can &#39;t  <br/>
manage to gather the attention span to calmly and thoughtfully engage  <br/>
in watching a child play a good, difficult video game) are just not  <br/>
as smart as those who can watch for fifteen minutes and come up with  <br/>
a dozen intellectual activities and skills at play besides &quot;eye/hand  <br/>
coordination.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But then there is that perspective, too—is a parent looking at a  <br/>
child through school-colored glass, or looking directly and  <br/>
expansively at her child in the real world?<br/>
One is very small, and right on one of those early-years checklists  <br/>
is &quot;eye/hand coordination.&quot;<br/>

on, Sandra.&nbsp; One of the things I&#39;ve learned about myself in playing video 
games with my kids, and watching them play, is that I&#39;m ot-nay as art-smay as I 
thought I was.&nbsp; Fortunately my kids don&#39;t hold it against me and they let 
me play anyway.&nbsp; It takes some work, though to be good enough at some games 
to not be a drag to them.&nbsp; And I will just add that I have always liked 
video games.&nbsp; DH and I were enthusiastic about sharing games with our kids 
from an early age and I have cute photos of Trayton in diapers, at a high chair 
playing Spelunx.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I had to fly through a level of Rebel 
Assault II for him when he was&nbsp;really little and would cry if he couldn&#39;t 
get through.&nbsp; Now he has to hold my hand while I learn a new game well 
enough to keep up.&nbsp; Usually I just watch.</font></span></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-58934639">The other day Kirby came in and watched me playing Guitar Hero.  He  <br/>
said &quot;I think you&#39;re better at this than I am now.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well...  no.  Because I play it like reading music, and there were  <br/>
some guitar things I know from playing guitar, like hammering on and  <br/>
pulling off.  So as long as it can relate to piano-read-by-notes or  <br/>
to finger picking, I&#39;m not bad.  But when it gets to the rock&#39;n&#39;roll  <br/>
solos where the notation isn&#39;t precise and you have to be wild and  <br/>
brave, I get scared because I don&#39;t &quot;know it.&quot;  I couldn&#39;t analyze  <br/>
it, and I can&#39;t put it into words or analogies.  But those passages  <br/>
are no harder for Kirby than the rest of it is.<br/>
<br/>
So Marty accidentally erased all our saved games; no problem,  <br/>
everyone was friendly and fine about it.   But I was stuck on the  <br/>
advanced level and I just want to get to the songs I know better and  <br/>
like, so I asked Kirby to help me, and he went right through those  <br/>
two songs I couldn&#39;t get.<br/>
<br/>
When he was five he could do the first part of the original Mario  <br/>
Game, but when Mario goes down the tube to the koopas, he got  <br/>
scared.  He just didn&#39;t like the look of them.  So he would  yell for  <br/>
me, and coach me through it, and when Mario was past those, he took  <br/>
it back and played lots of other parts.  Lava and swinging blades  <br/>
were fine with him, he just didn&#39;t like koopas. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s another area of partnership rather than diversity.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s another thing  That game belongs to Kirby, but Marty owns the  <br/>
Playstation, so it lives in Marty&#39;s room. He has never asked anyone  <br/>
to get out or not to play it.  And last Saturday all the kids were  <br/>
out and about.  Holly had gone with Marty to the ice rink to meet  <br/>
some others, and then they were going out to eat.  Nobody was here  <br/>
but me and Keith.   Full moon.  Hot tub.  I came in wet (swim suit  <br/>
and wet) to turn off the porch light and there are four people in the  <br/>
den—Holly, Marty and two of Kirby&#39;s friends.  Holly was showing the  <br/>
girl her Rent &quot;action figures&quot; and showing her some of the subtle  <br/>
details.  Marty was winding up video game cords.  I&#39;m glad I had come  <br/>
in because he said &quot;We&#39;re taking the X Box, in case you noticed it  <br/>
was gone.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Oh!  Kirby had called a few hours before and said &quot;I&#39;m going to  <br/>
dinner with those guys.&quot;  I thought he meant his burly big gaming  <br/>
buddies.  Later I called to talk to Holly and she said Kirby was at  <br/>
the restaurant with them.   So it turns out that yet another group of  <br/>
friends has folded into their activities.  Kirby&#39;s &quot;those guys&quot;  <br/>
included Marty and Holly, and their skate party which used to only  <br/>
involve the teen unschoolers now had included some of Kirby&#39;s current  <br/>
friends.<br/>
<br/>
And to get to the point of this pile of stories:    I was up when  <br/>
Kirby finally came in Sunday morning to go to bed at 6:00.  He said  <br/>
&quot;Where&#39;s the XBox?&quot; (because it usually lives on his desk) and I said  <br/>
&quot;They took it to Sadie&#39;s.&quot;  &quot;Oh, okay.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
All of that was said in the most matter-of-fact tone of voice.  Kirby  <br/>
bought the X-Box, but he didn&#39;t say &quot;Where&#39;s MY XBox,&quot; and he didn&#39;t  <br/>
mutter or ask who took it or why or when it would be back.<br/>
<br/>
Generosity.  Very cool.<br/>

and play with them (and shown by them) never can fully &#39;get&#39; the whole game <br/>
thing. I never got it - all through my childhood and 20&#39;s my brothers and my <br/>
husband loved gaming stuff but I couldn&#39;t get it at all. Now, my 6 year has <br/>
shown me an appreciation for computer games (we don&#39;t have any others as <br/>
yet) that I&#39;m really surprised I  have. I am hooked on one particular game - <br/>
more hooked than Lewi! It&#39;s fun and there&#39;s so much stuff to solve. They are <br/>
baffling and frustrating, and at the moment I&#39;m on level 98 (of a 100 level <br/>
game) and sometimes I feel like I&#39;ll never make it to the end...but I keep <br/>
on keeping on. LOL Self-regulation has allowed me to discover something <br/>
really good and lots of fun.<br/>
