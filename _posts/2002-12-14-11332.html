&lt;&lt; &quot;Why is your name first? Keith&#39;s name should be first.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I almost always sign our cards &quot;Ren and Markus&quot;. <br/>
And my checkbook has only one name, MINE!! hehe<br/>
My Grandma still addresses stuff to &quot;Mrs. Markus Allen&quot; as though I have no <br/>
identity without my husband.....but she doesn&#39;t, so I guess she thinks I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t either.<br/>
My return address labels say Ren Allen, my checkbook is my own, my debit card <br/>
my own and same for him. I guess we both crave independence even with the <br/>
financial thing.<br/>
Even though we share the decisions about the money, we like having our own <br/>
accounts.<br/>
And he pays all the living expenses and bills, so I get to play a little!! <br/>
Like going to an unschooling conference or something.....:)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s the attitude I try to take.  I have my own last name, as does my <br/>
husband.  They are different.  The children are hypehnated.  It seems to be <br/>
confusing for everyone except for us.  We get mail addressed every which way. <br/>
 On the other hand, we always know when a someone is calling to sell us <br/>
something...<br/>

 I almost always sign our cards &quot;Ren and Markus&quot;. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I used to always sign our cards Kathy and Mike and then after we had kids<br/>
I signed them with &quot;the dad&quot; first, myself and the kids in chrono order.  <br/>
Hmmm.<br/>
Have to think about that. It seems that I started doing that after I saw that<br/>
is how other people do it. I think I should take the first place position <br/>
back,<br/>
since I am the one who signs the damm things anyhow!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; And my checkbook has only one name, MINE!! hehe&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I had to look at my personal acct. My name is second...but at the teachers<br/>
credit union acct (got signed up thru my mom, who was signed up thru her<br/>
dad, who was signed up thru his son who is a private school principal) my<br/>
name is primary on the account. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; My return address labels say Ren Allen&gt;&gt;<br/>
I have addy labels that have just my name on them and some that say Mr & Mrs.<br/>
<br/>
,&lt;&lt;my debit card  my own&gt;&gt;<br/>
I just opened a new credit card acct with my name only.  We don&#39;t use them<br/>
but I found it helpful when renting a car (almost impossible to rent a car w/o<br/>
a cc)<br/>
<br/>
Another side note, when we got married I didn&#39;t change my name. I had better<br/>
credit than dh and didn&#39;t want to mess that up. I also had a confidential <br/>
marriage<br/>
license, so I didn&#39;t even have to say I was married to him and they couldn&#39;t<br/>
prove it by any records, thus my credit stayed mine.  Well after many years I<br/>
think that would be harder to prove. I have given all my children their <br/>
fathers last<br/>
name, on our corporation my accountant used my married name as my last<br/>
name (so I can&#39;t notarize anything because my legal name is still my maiden<br/>
name). Anyhow, since our names and lives are so intertwined I have finally <br/>
decided to hyphenate my name.  That way I can sign either or legally and not<br/>
have to change so much of what I have in my name currently!  Funny dh doesn&#39;t<br/>
care if I change my name at all, but I sort of feel left out since I am the <br/>
only one<br/>
with a different name (although I introduce myself using my married name and<br/>
my family does also). Heck even the bank lets me cash checks with my married<br/>
name which is not on any ID including my drivers license.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; and same for him. I guess we both crave independence even with the <br/>
 financial thing.<br/>
 Even though we share the decisions about the money, we like having our own <br/>
 accounts.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I handle all the money and I like it that way. Good thing dh hates to deal <br/>
with<br/>
that and I don&#39;t. Its a nice equal distribution in our family.  He makes it <br/>
but<br/>
I manage it.  Actually we both take a salary from our business which direct<br/>
deposits into our personal acct.  And I can make my salary more than his<br/>
if I want to.....; )  And all the bonuses and draws are made out in my name<br/>
since I do all the banking &lt;G&gt;.  Besides I need to pay more taxes than he<br/>
does right now to qualify for disability.  <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m older than Keith.  <br/>
If I&#39;m signing for everyone, I usually just put &quot;the Dodd gang&quot; or <br/>
&quot;Keith, Sandra and them...&quot; or something goofy.<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;ve calligraphed cards I&#39;ve put all our names with Keith first, though.<br/>
Other years (when we&#39;ve done home-printed cards, which won&#39;t be this year) <br/>
people sign their own name and we print from that.  Scattered around the <br/>
bottom.<br/>

If I can remember correctly, it says on the license, confidential marriage <br/>
license,<br/>
and is only filed at the county office that I took it out of.  It is not <br/>
supposed to<br/>
be public record.  I don&#39;t remember though if someone went to that specific <br/>
county office if they could access the license. <br/>
