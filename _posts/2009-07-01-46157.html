<div id="ygrps-yiv-1639896963">I wanted to share a story from yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
The boys are getting on each other&#39;s nerves, so we&#39;re trying to separate<br/>
them more, take only one at a time on errands, that kind of thing, so it was<br/>
Rowan&#39;s turn to come grocery shopping with me and Aurora. Off we went. And<br/>
many great conversations were had. Amongst these, was a talk about how Rowan<br/>
was excited about Halloween because &quot;you can eat as much candy as you want.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, we don&#39;t do restrictions. There are several bags of different types of<br/>
sweets in their &quot;free range drawer&quot; (the place on the boat where they can go<br/>
to get their own snacks whenever they want, without having to ask us to get<br/>
them.) So I was kinda surprised. I asked &quot;do you feel like you can&#39;t have as<br/>
much as you want whenever?&quot; and he said &quot;Yeah, basically.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hm, says I. Let&#39;s fix that.<br/>
<br/>
Since we were on our way to the store anyway, we picked up a huge bag of<br/>
chocolate drops, and a huge bag of jelly bellies. Every flavor he wanted, as<br/>
much as he wanted. It was great fun. And as soon as we left the store, he<br/>
started eating. He experimented with one at a time (for the flavor) and<br/>
handfuls at a time (for the sheer joy of doing so). He also had purchased a<br/>
rootbeer, and was seeing what happened when he mixed whatever flavor with<br/>
rootbeer.<br/>
<br/>
We got back to the boat, and of course Kes wanted some, so we poured the bag<br/>
into a big flat bowl, so everyone could pick their own flavors. Kes did the<br/>
same one at a time, handful at a time, blah blah blah.<br/>
<br/>
And this will come as zero surprise to anyone here... but probably 1/2 of<br/>
what we bought is still sitting in the bowl this morning, untouched, and<br/>
both boys feel like they&#39;ve had plenty of jelly beans and are totally<br/>
content. The chocolate is in the bag, untouched. And the feeling of scarcity<br/>
has been banished.<br/>
<br/>
I love living like this.<br/>

What might surprise me is that they wanted sweets.  Maybe after  <br/>
feeling abundance for a bit they&#39;ll ask for things besides candy.<br/>

<br/>
Totally. Fruit, crackers, chips, pickles, olives, cliff bars, juice bottles,<br/>
whatever attracts them.  One or the other of them comes grocery shopping<br/>
with us, so they have the ability to pick stuff that way, and Rowan&#39;s been<br/>
having fun putting stuff on the grocery list by himself.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Boats are really difficult to get around even for adults. The main access to<br/>
the refrigerator is a hole up in the countertop, and it&#39;s heavy because of<br/>
the insulation.  There&#39;s a second door, but it&#39;s really tough to open so<br/>
that it doesn&#39;t accidentally fly open when the boat&#39;s underway. Lots of<br/>
other food items are stored away in cabinets, but storage is designed to be<br/>
good for the boat, not really good for the people on the boat. So we set up<br/>
the drawer as an accessible place for the stuff they like best, and we&#39;re<br/>
totally up for putting whatever they&#39;re into at the moment there.<br/>
<br/>

Yeah, it surprised me too, and I think Pam might be onto something; they&#39;re<br/>
trying it on. But it felt really, really good to just say &quot;oh, OK, you&#39;re<br/>
feeling a lack there for whatever reason, and we can address it right now<br/>
with no drama, before it becomes A Big Thing (tm)&quot;. They&#39;ve gone through<br/>
stages of asking for other stuff before; there&#39;s a story about Kestrel<br/>
turning down sweets in favor of garlic pickles on your site.<br/>

<h4>emiLy Q.</h4>
<time> 1 Jul 2009, at 11:51am</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1647605587">Same here.  Yesterday I was asking/telling Delia not to do something (I<br/>
should remember what it was, but I don&#39;t), and she said &quot;Are you going to<br/>
spank me?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We are reading Little House in the Big Woods, and there are a few mentions<br/>
of Pa using a switch and/or spanking Laura in it.  We talk about it a little<br/>
bit while/after we read - mostly her asking why and me not having a very<br/>
good answer!  I&#39;ve been thinking about those scenes at other times, too, so<br/>
I&#39;m not surprised Delia is too.<br/>
<br/>
In unrelated news but it doesn&#39;t warrant a whole post, my two year old made<br/>
an H with crayons a few minutes ago.  He was saying &quot;Me!  Me!&quot; so I looked<br/>
over and he had put 3 crayons in an H shape.  What&#39;s interesting is that my<br/>
daughter made an H out of an apple wedge and two pieces of cheese when she<br/>
was about the same age (probably younger).  Henry&#39;s name starts with H so he<br/>
identifies with that letter, but they both made that letter shape first.<br/>

commonly held up in my homeschooling group as excellent to read to  <br/>
young kids. I had heard too much about the poor treatment of children  <br/>
and Native Americans in them and since I was in a politically-correct  <br/>
state of mind at the time, chose not include them in our read-aloud  <br/>
books. Now that I look back on it, I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t read them because  <br/>
of the depiction of apparently loving families hitting their kids. It  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have been a good thing *for Michelle*. I&#39;m glad that that  <br/>
image didn&#39;t enter her head at all. For other kids, they understand  <br/>
it.  But I think it would have disturbed Michelle too much, at the age  <br/>
we might have been reading them.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t have banned the books, if she decided she wanted to read  <br/>
them (and they were available to her at the library, bookstore and  <br/>
friends&#39; houses), but she never showed any interest in them. She  <br/>
wanted more books on Native Americans, as her heritage is Nez Perce on  <br/>
her dad&#39;s side. We also read fictionalized girls&#39; diaries from those  <br/>
times (based on true events) in the Dear America and Dear Canada series.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to ask, though, if people here think that I ought to have  <br/>
brought the Little House books into our lives? Were there important  <br/>
things to be learned from them that could not be discovered elsewhere?  <br/>

 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think no to both questions.<br/>
<br/>
Ma is very negative about the &quot;savage Injuns&quot; and there<br/>
is the hitting.  There&#39;s interesting stuff about 19th<br/>
century pioneer living, churning butter and making<br/>
maple syrup candy, stuff about how log homes are built<br/>
and how animals are hunted and butchered and smoked<br/>
or cooked, farming techniques and so on.  Certain<br/>
expectations about church attendance and school attendance.<br/>
Specific gender roles.  An implicit belief in Manifest<br/>
Destiny.  I don&#39;t know what would be considered &quot;important&quot; <br/>
and I can&#39;t think of anything one couldn&#39;t learn elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose the books inspire some people to try churning<br/>
butter or to visit a maple grove to see the trees being<br/>
tapped and the sap being collected; I think we would<br/>
have done those things anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the writing in the books written by Rose<br/>
Wilder--that&#39;s all of &#39;em except _The First Four<br/>
Years_ is lovely, but obviously there are many other<br/>
books to read if you are looking for lovely prose.<br/>
<br/>
We liked the books, and even the politically incorrect<br/>
parts, but I wouldn&#39;t say they are a &quot;must read.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what I would say is a must read.<br/>

I don&#39;t know about whether you &quot;ought to have&quot; read these to your kids but I loved these books as a child, I reread them as an adult and I have read the first 2 to my kids. Whenever we are reading books from another time, or viewpoint, or culture, just as with movies, there may be things in them which concern me or the kids. We just talk them through. I have read all of them and thought that they were well worth reading. They are very loving, not at all full of violence or cruelty. A lot of that is personal viewpoint, though. I wouldn&#39;t try to get someone to read something they didn&#39;t want to read; you had asked.  Cameron<br/>

<h4>emiLy Q.</h4>
<time> 1 Jul 2009, at  7:39pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1081590432">I read Little House on the Prairie many, many times as a child and pretended<br/>
to be Laura ALL the time.  We had a bouncy horse that we put in front of a<br/>
crib, which was our covered wagon and we played and played and played.  I<br/>
dressed up as Laura Ingalls for Halloween at least twice.  This is mostly<br/>
why I got the whole series and am reading them to my daughter.  I haven&#39;t<br/>
read any of the books besides Little House on the Prairie so I&#39;m looking<br/>
forward to learning more of the story.  That, and because we live near where<br/>
the story takes place so we&#39;ll be going to the places mentioned in the<br/>
books.  My daughter likes talking about stuff that really happened, and I<br/>
like that about these books as well.  I get a little sick of all the make<br/>
believe / fantasy in children&#39;s books so this is nice - a break from fairies<br/>
or talking animals or superheroes...  :)<br/>
<br/>
I usually say something like &quot;Pa thought he was teaching her&quot; or &quot;Pa just<br/>
thought that was what he should do&quot;  We talk a lot about people thinking /<br/>
believing things that we do NOT think or believe, so it doesn&#39;t seem too<br/>
strange to me.  When my daughter asked if I was going to spank her, I know<br/>
she didn&#39;t really think I would, I think it was what popped into her mind at<br/>
the moment and she wanted to talk about it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2043152218">I read them as a child more than once and I have a first edition of one of the books that my brother got for me, but none of the others. I loved the idea of a pioneer life and I still do find it fascinating. My mom made me a bonnet and a dress and we went to Minden, Nebraska&#39;s Pioneer Village where I bought a broom. She&#39;s made a dress for Linnaea that was very similar and Linnaea loved it in her turn. No bonnet, though. <br/>
<br/>
I have diaries by women who lived in the Dakotas and Nebraska who often made their living as teachers, although one is about two sisters who homesteaded. Old Jules is one of the best reads I know about that kind of life. These weren&#39;t nice people living nice lives. These were people who needed to move up and out and away and didn&#39;t really like to be near their neighbors. These were also my people. My grandfather crossed Kansas in a covered wagon and his grandfather was shot over water rights and his shooter was lynched. Giants in the Earth is also a really fascinating look at the intense loneliness and the possibilities of homesteading. I don&#39;t recall much child hitting in that book. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think Laura Ingalls is the be all end all to exploring that expansionist history of the U.S. I haven&#39;t read them to Linnaea or Simon. It isn&#39;t as relevant to a British education as it was to my midwestern upbringing. They are fascinating accounts of a bare bones life. And they are the halcyon days of yore books, like Swallows and Amazons (which I couldn&#39;t finish), they are about how interesting and engaging a life of nature and exploring can be. And I honestly think that&#39;s why they are the books that get touted by the homeschooling community. They are a life without computers and television and video games and the lives are good and Laura lived to be 90 so it wasn&#39;t all hardship. Maybe that&#39;s why I liked Old Jules and Giants in the Earth so much, the life isn&#39;t being painted with a lot of whitewash to show how scarcity makes for a well lived childhood. It might also be why I found Luc Sante&#39;s books about Hell&#39;s Kitchen in New York and a picture<br/>
 book of death in NYC from the photos of the earliest NYC police photographers so fascinating as well as  Wisconsin Death Trip, which is a collection of newspaper articles about insanity and death in Wisconsin in the late 1800&#39;s. But as a child I loved the Boxcar Children and Anne of Green Gables and Betsy, Tacy and Tibb, I liked the myth of a childhood of hardship being good for the soul. <br/>

I&#39;d like to ask, though, if people here think that I ought to have  <br/>
brought the Little House books into our lives? Were there important  <br/>
things to be learned from them that could not be discovered elsewhere?  <br/>
I realize that I can&#39;t have a &quot;do-over&quot; but it would be interesting to  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-122939800"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I&#39;d like to ask, though, if people here think that I ought to have<br/>
&gt; brought the Little House books into our lives? Were there important<br/>
&gt; things to be learned from them that could not be discovered elsewhere?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Those questions are ones that will turn thinking away from  <br/>
unschooling. It&#39;s looking at a thing and wondering if there is  <br/>
learning and importance in it. It will lead to worry about how to get  <br/>
it into the child. And what if the child rejects it? How else can  <br/>
that &quot;important thing&quot; get into the child?<br/>
<br/>
The question that will turn thinking toward unschooling is &quot;Is this  <br/>
something my particular child might enjoy?&quot; Ask it of the Little  <br/>
House books, the circus, South Park, pistachio ice cream,  <br/>
trampolines, a garden, grocery shopping, a crossword puzzle ....<br/>
<br/>
Rather than facing a thing and wondering at its merits and how or  <br/>
whether to get it into a child, face the child and wonder how to  <br/>
nurture and support who the child is and what fascinates them, and  <br/>
what kinds of things that they haven&#39;t experienced yet that they  <br/>
might also like.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t remember the Little House series being touted as examples of  <br/>
family role models by homeschoolers, but I don&#39;t doubt it. It was  <br/>
very popular among the school at homers, especially the  <br/>
fundamentalists and I can see the family relationship being a selling  <br/>
point for them. But it was also an easy way for curriculum users to  <br/>
get history into their kids!<br/>
<br/>
But for me the merit of trying the series with Kathryn was that it  <br/>
was a meatier story than what was normally targeted at 4 yos. (It  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have even occurred to me to try it with her except that  <br/>
several homeschoolers had said their 4 yos liked it.) I think I read  <br/>
it to her on her 4th birthday and she was fascinated by it. (She also  <br/>
inexplicably enjoyed Dances with Wolves which was 3 hours long. And  <br/>
Seven Samurai which is longer in Japanese and black and white and I  <br/>
read the subtitles to her over 3 days. Not sure what possessed me to  <br/>
try that but she enjoyed it!)<br/>
<br/>
But my particular child isn&#39;t sensitive. She doesn&#39;t get that  <br/>
empathic connection some kids do that would cause them to be  <br/>
disturbed by the moments of harshness. (I don&#39;t remember many of  <br/>
them, but for a sensitive child they would loom larger.) The  <br/>
harshness was just part of the story for her. Just as Xena kills  <br/>
things with a sword. While they might be role models for characters  <br/>
she creates, they aren&#39;t role models for her life. Our real life is  <br/>
and was her role model. Different lifestyles can certainly be fodder  <br/>
for conversation though.<br/>
<br/>
As for Ma&#39;s negative attitude toward Indians -- for those who haven&#39;t  <br/>
read the series, Pa&#39;s was different and I believe it was clear Laura  <br/>
understood his view better than her mother&#39;s -- again the question to  <br/>
ask is &quot;Is this something my child would find upsetting?&quot; I don&#39;t  <br/>
think we should fear kids seeing other viewpoints. Hate doesn&#39;t come  <br/>
reading about someone hating someone. And it&#39;s helpful to understand  <br/>
why people hate. It&#39;s helpful to see them as real people with real  <br/>
(to them) reasons for hating others. People who hate, people who  <br/>
strike their kids, people who steal, people who use drugs are not  <br/>
&quot;other&quot;. They aren&#39;t some other lifeform or people who just decided  <br/>
they&#39;ll be bad and do bad things. They have understandable reasons  <br/>
for their choices. Understanding doesn&#39;t make them right! (If I&#39;m  <br/>
remembering right, Ma had understandable reasons for her fear and  <br/>
hatred.) And that&#39;s more fodder for discussion.<br/>
<br/>
But, *the* bottom line question is, &quot;Is this something my child will  <br/>
enjoy?&quot;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have a little twist on this question.  I think the Little House  <br/>
books are something my daughter would enjoy reading.  I read them when  <br/>
I was young, and I read them aloud to my son around the time he  <br/>
started reading on his own.  My problem is that my daughter will not  <br/>
knowingly read, watch or listen to anything that references throwing  <br/>
up.  It is a major anxiety of hers.  For movies, thankfully, there&#39;s  <br/>
kidsinmind.com and imdb.com&#39;s parental guides which I always check for  <br/>
her before she&#39;ll agree to watch a movie.  But the only way I can  <br/>
think of to preview a book is to read it myself ahead of her.  We read  <br/>
to her a lot.  She has at least three different books going at any  <br/>
given time -- one being read to her by each of us, her brother, her  <br/>
father and myself.  She&#39;s had several books read to her multiple times  <br/>
-- when there&#39;s a favorite story that is known to have throwing up in  <br/>
it, per her request, we either skip that part of the story or we  <br/>
substitute some other more hilarious bodily function to get her  <br/>
through it.<br/>
<br/>
So, my question is, do any of you who have read the Little House books  <br/>
recall any parts of the stories when somebody throws up?  I can&#39;t  <br/>
remember any throwing up in the stories but I&#39;m not certain.  I&#39;d like  <br/>
to be able to assure my daughter that she can read these books herself  <br/>
without concern for stumbling, unexpectedly into a disturbing scene.   <br/>
Maybe I should just pre-read them, again -- they&#39;d be quick reads for  <br/>
me no doubt.<br/>

midwestern upbringing.-=-<br/>
<br/>
A few days ago I wrote this, and as I was writing it I was aware of  <br/>
the way I was constructing the list:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;There are many fun things to do and explore that could be called  <br/>
&quot;science,&quot; but why not just call them skate boards or miniature golf  <br/>
or basketball or piano or water play or rescuing wounded birds or  <br/>
making goop or collecting rocks or swimming or drawing pictures of  <br/>
clouds or taking photos in different kinds of light or growing corn or  <br/>
training a dog or looking through binoculars or waiting for a  <br/>
chrysalis to open or making a sundial or making a web page or flying a  <br/>
kite or chasing fireflies or building a campfire or finding out which  <br/>
planet that is by the moon on the horizon, or wondering why snowballs  <br/>
take so much snow to make, or how a 4wheel drive truck works.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In keeping with the point I&#39;m zinging toward, I&#39;ll comment on  <br/>
Schuyler&#39;s point first.  It&#39;s in mind because I&#39;m about to go to  <br/>
England for the third time in my life.  The first time was in 1979 (I  <br/>
think; give or take a year).  I was in a fish&#39;n&#39;chips shop run by  <br/>
Asians (Chinese I think) and they were watching Dukes of Hazard while  <br/>
my fish was frying.  I went to England with Holly in 2000.  There  <br/>
seemed to be a daily TV broadcast of Little House on the Prairie.   <br/>
Maybe it was only weekly, and I happened to see it more than once.<br/>
<br/>
In both cases it was like the poster of the Grand Canyon I saw on that  <br/>
first trip, in the window of a tiny travel agency office near the  <br/>
Twinings Tea shop near Picadilly Circus (which isn&#39;t at all like the  <br/>
circus Joyce mentioned in her list).   What is exotic, in a place, is  <br/>
what is unlike that place.<br/>
<br/>
When I watch Seven Samurai I like the construction of the pens and  <br/>
little out buildings and the clothing and the people&#39;s glance and  <br/>
posture (which now reminds me of anime, but didn&#39;t when I first saw  <br/>
it.  When Keith watches it I know he likes the interpersonal relations  <br/>
of the men, the class issues, and the fighting.   He&#39;s quite into the  <br/>
parallels with cowboy movies, and not just the obvious.  Keith likes  <br/>
Seven Samurai much more than I do, but he&#39;s a martial arts kind of  <br/>
guy.  I&#39;m a language-thinking person, and that movie isn&#39;t in a  <br/>
language I understand.<br/>
<br/>
So back to my seeming lack of point:<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s harder to make a list of things that aren&#39;t related than to make  <br/>
a list of things that are.  There&#39;s a game called &quot;Set&quot; and it&#39;s  <br/>
famously easier for children to play than adults (generally; of course  <br/>
there are exceptions, and any visual or pattern/mathematical  thinkers  <br/>
will do better than people who think in words).  One type of set of  <br/>
three in that game is three things that are all equally different.<br/>
<br/>
Mental gymnastics are good for unschooling parents.  If you can jump  <br/>
from one idea to another, as unrelated as possible, somehow you  <br/>
calculated or mapped out what WAS related in a split second so you  <br/>
could jump away from the connections you were making.  Then when you  <br/>
jump to a third idea or example, you go away from both of those, and  <br/>
in the time it takes to make such a list you&#39;ve given your mind an  <br/>
interesting workout, and it will leave a little after-trail like the  <br/>
afterimage you see after waving a sparkler in the dark.<br/>
<br/>
I used to have the Little House cookbook (created by and for Christian  <br/>
homeschoolers, it seemed) but I sold it on ebay.  It rarely fails that  <br/>
I regret not having things I get rid of. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As a puzzle or a goof, if you feel like it, maybe try to think of &quot;a  <br/>
set&quot; of things that aren&#39;t at all related, either here on the list or  <br/>
in your head while you&#39;re loading the dishwasher or on paper when  <br/>
you&#39;re waiting somewhere or with your kids as a game.<br/>
<br/>
If a school-at-home curriculum can be based on Little House on the  <br/>
Prairie, maybe an unschooling &quot;curriculum&quot; needs to involve people  <br/>
with a facility for finding much larger patterns and connections (or  <br/>
lack thereof).<br/>

Something I have discovered about gettting older is that knowledge becomes more and more of a web and seemingly unrelated things become connected.  I try to verbalise these connections in conversation with my children so they can look for them too.  Often something I have known nothing about now seems to crop up in all sorts of unexpected places.  For example, just after I read &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot; I saw in passing an article about the former dictator of the Congo dying in Time magazine and a couple of years later when reading&quot;The White Man&#39;s Burden&quot; I was led to &quot;King Leopold&#39;s Ghost.&quot;  so now I have quite a comprehensive picture of the development of the Congo which I would never have picked out as a study option in the conventional sense. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ahh connections!  That originally aired right after we&#39;d finished<br/>
reading the books, so it was very timely for visuals.  A similar thing<br/>
happened when Chamille was really interested WWII and everything that<br/>
had to do with the holocaust.  We happened to be at the local mall, and<br/>
they had an extensive exhibit all about Anne Frank set up in an empty<br/>
store.<br/>
<br/>
I like it when life does that!  It happens a lot, especially since<br/>
opening up to unschooling.  I think part of it is that we are more open<br/>
to all things and opportunities, so the opportunities seem to present<br/>
themselves on silver platters.</div>
