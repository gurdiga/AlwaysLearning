<div id="ygrps-yiv-1424240209">By now, most of you have seen the unschooling article on msn. They now have<br/>
a poll up along with readers&#39; opinions of unschooling at<br/>

Unschooling isn&#39;t doing very well in the poll right now.<br/>

Luckily that poll isn&#39;t what makes unschooling work.  Forget the  <br/>
poll.  If unschooling &quot;does well in the poll&quot; because fifty   <br/>
unschooling rats press the bar, that doesn&#39;t change unschooling either.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-332256397">Based on the response, I think my intention may have been misunderstood.<br/>
<br/>
I dislike when people who know nothing about a topic, have never  <br/>
tried it nor educated themselves about it are the ones who are the  <br/>
only voice, spreading negativity without a counter balance.  I think  <br/>
that the media has picked up the topic is a way to spread a  <br/>
wonderful, healing alternative message not just for children but  <br/>
families as well.  The survey may be a way to discern interest enough  <br/>
to pursue further media exploration.  I have never felt positive  <br/>
press is a bad thing.<br/>
<br/>
I was spreading the site location not to foster negativity on  <br/>
unschooling sites about offering the information but for those who  <br/>
would like to contribute to the positive being better and more  <br/>
accurately represented as well.<br/>
