<div id="ygrps-yiv-2072892947">Sorry---can&#39;t seem to find the title of this totally wonderful thread!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve saved and printed several posts: Sandra & Sylvia & Deb & PamL-----maybe <br/>
another two or three as well. <br/>
<br/>
As Sandra said: this has really had me thinking lately. I&#39;d planned to write <br/>
a little here before it took off. My post got longer and longer and longer <br/>
(oops!), so I figured I&#39;d send it on to Helen (HEM) just for kicks. If she <br/>
doesn&#39;t want it, I&#39;ll make y&#39;all suffer instead! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I DO think that AlwaysLearning is the list for &quot;thems that&#39;s already got <br/>
it&quot;----and BOY! Can you tell it with these last two digests! Inspiring!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for some awesome posts!<br/>

Well, dang.  I better renew my subscription.  I let it go because I was<br/>
confident I could read Sandra&#39;s articles on her website.  Now there&#39;s you<br/>
and Ren, bunch of show off writer types making me resubscribe...<br/>
