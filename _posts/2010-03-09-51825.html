<div id="ygrps-yiv-274558856">Today in the chat Jill was asking for ideas about how to let her  <br/>
husband feel better about her 15 year old daughter&#39;s interest in  <br/>
interpersonals.  We brainstormed a bit, but I&#39;ve come to report that  <br/>
right after the chat, Holly was talking to Marty about how to get a  <br/>
program onto our &quot;instant queue&quot; on Netflix.  I wasn&#39;t paying full  <br/>
attention, but she did what Marty said and got the video up.<br/>
<br/>
It started in right away talking about Sigmund Freud and what the  <br/>
purpose of dreams and sleep are.<br/>
