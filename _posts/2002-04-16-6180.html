&gt; To me, Not Doing is NOT DOING....for a while....sort<br/>

&gt; see the different patterns. Not a permanent, all the<br/>
&gt; time thing.  I DO lots, too. <br/>

I DO lots, too...(said with a tone of defensiveness.....smile) . I think the <br/>
times of NOT doing allow for rest needed to be truly inspired.....<br/>
<br/>
For example, I notice that on days when dd describes herself as &#39;bored&#39; and <br/>
sits around a lot is the day she does an incredible project or creates a <br/>
magical time with a friend.....It is tempting to find stuff for her to do and <br/>
get frustrated with her expressions of boredom, but now I can see that that <br/>
quiet/low time  serve a purpose.....<br/>
<br/>
imo, one must be quiet to hear the inner voice....listen to the inner <br/>
spirit....and when one does - true inspiration can occur....<br/>
<br/>
Everyone has their own balance for activity and quiet.....I&#39;m seeking mine <br/>
after years of over-activity in the name of &#39;should do&#39;......Like <br/>
stress/illness will alert one to over-activity, I can count on boredom to <br/>
move me back to my center/balance.....<br/>
<br/>
Have a good day!<br/>
