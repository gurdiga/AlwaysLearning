 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t see it as a choosing to go to school question.<br/>
<br/>
You have a daughter who misses her friends and her old life where she got to see them often. She&#39;s grieving. It&#39;s hard to see it that way since the door isn&#39;t entirely closed as it would be if you moved across the country.<br/>
<br/>
The solution she&#39;s come up with is making the 45 minute trip to the Montessori school. But she&#39;s idealizing it. As you&#39;ve observed she really doesn&#39;t want to make that drive everyday. It&#39;s just that she doesn&#39;t see any other way.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re trying to give her what she&#39;s asking for to fix her feelings. It&#39;s like it&#39;s raining on the day a picnic was planned. You *could* worry that she&#39;s disappointed and call up a big tent company to erect a tent. You could rent spotlights that simulate the sun.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you&#39;re doing well exploring new options so she can move on. But add in some respect that she will feel sad for a while. You can say, &quot;It would be nice if we could snap our fingers and be at their house!&quot; with the same tone you&#39;d use about the rain. That is, with an understanding that life won&#39;t always give us what we want.<br/>

<div
 style='FONT-SIZE:small;TEXT-DECORATION:none;FONT-FAMILY:"Calibri";FONT-WEIGHT:normal;COLOR:#000000;FONT-STYLE:normal;DISPLAY:inline;'>My
daughter went through a stage around a similar age of wanting to go to school.
It went away when we found more homeschooling activities. These days, we’re out
either at activities (some just playdates, sometimes short activities, with lots
of play around them) at least 4 days a week, sometimes more. This seems to be a
good balance for my daughter. But every child is going to be different, and it
took us about 6 months of adding or subtracting activities until we found what
works for us. We still vary it by adding in one on one (or 2-3 on one!)
playdates either at home, or at parks, from month to month. Sometimes I find it
easier to offer to look after people’s kids for the day so that my daughter has
friends, and I can still get some work done. Most mums jump at the chance.
(Except the ones that are as busy as we are, and struggle to find the
time!)</div></div>
