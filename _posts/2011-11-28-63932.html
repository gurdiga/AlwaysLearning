<div id="ygrps-yiv-1544427023">Hi, we have 3 girls - 5, 3, and 7 months<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading this list for a while and read a lot about Minecraft, which I played a little but seems advanced for G5. Then recently I heard about Roblox which looks like 7 and over. G5 likes playing all the little games in Zoodles on my Mac, and G5 & G3 are consummate iPad users - they taught themselves how to do everything. G5 asks to purchase new iPad games all the time and lately I&#39;ve noted an up-tick in her ability to handle more complicated stuff. She had me purchase Cut The Rope and has worked through 4 boxes in 2 days. G3 tries to copy everything she does and does pretty well herself too on the creative/drawing games. G5 is also extremely social. Friends with everyone on block irregardless of age, and sends video emails to my parents daily.<br/>
<br/>
Because they don&#39;t read though, they can&#39;t find new games on the computer.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas for good games for her we can try together? She might be ready for a social element too...<br/>
<br/>
What about a Wii? We don&#39;t have one. Does anyone recommend it, and if so, what games would you recommend?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1642010760">-=-Any ideas for good games for her we can try together? She might be ready for a social element too...-=-<br/>
<br/>
Plants vs. Zombies<br/>
Angry Birds<br/>
<br/>
G5 and G3 are Apple computers.  If you can find it in your heart and fingers to write &quot;five year old&quot; instead of g5 of dd5, it will make things easier to read.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>World of Goo: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.worldofgoo.com/">http://www.worldofgoo.com/</a> is a great game for any age.  I love the graphics - very Tim Burton.  There are versions for Wii, iPad, and computer.<br/>
<br/>
My son has long loved this site:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.physicsgames.net/">http://www.physicsgames.net/</a>  There are so many great games there that are free and a lot of fun.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-23001380">My daughter is the same age as yours.  She really loves the plants vs zombies app on iPad and the iPhone. Also pocket frogs, and islash, and we download many other apps. Some we hold onto for a while, others get deleted if she, myself or my husband aren&#39;t playing them anymore to make room for new ones.<br/>
<br/>
Plants vs zombies has kept us all entertained for months now and is definitely our favorite.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-180581434">My 5 year old daughter Gigi has been playing Wii since she was 4. It started with a Disney Princess game and the next that she loves is Kirby&#39;s Epic Yarn. I highly recommend the Wii for that age. My son also used to play the Wii a lot at that age.<br/>
On the computer she plays games we find at Nick  and Disney Websites.<br/>
Disney Princess<br/>
I can be Barbie<br/>
Winx Club<br/>
Pet Pet Park<br/>
are her favorites.<br/>
<br/>
She also loves Happy Wheels ( Total Jerk Face Website)but you may find it super offensive as it is pretty gory.<br/>

Just wanted to add <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.kidzui.com/.">http://www.kidzui.com/.</a> It is a free internet browser for children with 100s of free games. My daughters 6 and 11 play all their on-line computer games there. There are several dress up type games and others that don&#39;t involve reading at all.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-624337170">My son started gaming when he was 5 with his first Nintendo handheld. He got a Wii when he was 7. I suggest getting one! They are marked down right now for the holidays. All Mario games are fun for both boys and girls. I also suggest the Kirby games! We also enjoy/enjoyed the Sims Pets, Wii Sports, Wipeout the game, Shrek, and all of the Nintendogs/Cats games. There are so many great games specifically tailored to girls. <br/>
<br/>
One thing I like to do is go to a Gamestop store and ask questions about games. Most of the people that work at the shops are very knowledgable about all games. <br/>
<br/>
For the computer, we have both PC and Mac (a lot of games are offered for both now!) and Xander loved the Kid Pix software. CartoonNetwork.com has many games for kids, too, if you are looking for online games. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-451116911">My daughter is 7, and she loves the Wii.  She&#39;s mainly into the Mario games, <br/>
which  have a lot of different types of games.  She watches a lot of videos <br/>
of people playing on utube and discovers games she&#39;d like to play that way. <br/>
She also likes games such as Sports Resort.  There are also Barbie games <br/>
that she really enjoys.  She is only just getting the hang of playing these <br/>
games by herself, and finds some of them quite hard past the beginning <br/>
levels, but I wouldn&#39;t necessarily say that all kids would, as so many seem <br/>
to play them with no troubles.  Luckily, my husband and I are really <br/>
enjoying playing them too, so we often all play together.  Many of them have <br/>
cooperative mode, great for when you have more than one child or for a <br/>
parent to help out.  She&#39;s also enjoyed watching my husband play through the <br/>
lego games (Star Wars and Indiana Jones, though she doesn&#39;t want to watch <br/>
the movies, she enjoys the games).<br/>
<br/>
She also has an iPad, and enjoys a lot of games on there.  She can play <br/>
these mostly by herself, and it has the big advantage of being portable! <br/>
Some games she&#39;s enjoyed is the Angry Birds series, Dora games (these are <br/>
more simple, more interactive story books), and a lot of the building style <br/>
games.  Right now she&#39;s enjoying Pet Hotel.<br/>
<br/>
We also have a playstation.  The older one (ps2) has a lot of games she <br/>
enjoys, such as Dora, and her favourite is Spyro.  This was where she <br/>
started on playing on consoles.  You can get a lot of good kids games second <br/>
hand, so if budget is tight, it&#39;s not a bad place to start.<br/>
<br/>
For Christmas, we&#39;ve asked the IL&#39;s to buy her a Nintendo 3DS (they asked <br/>
what she would like), as it&#39;s a bit out of our budget right now.  From <br/>
looking around, there is a good range of kids games, and a lot of them are <br/>
cheaper than games for the Wii.  Not sure what it&#39;s like to play on yet <br/>
though.<br/>

We also have Active Life Explorer and our daughter loves it! I bought it brand new on Amazon last year for $30 (it also came with the mat needed to play and I got free shipping)! It really helped last winter when we couldn&#39;t get outside to play. At first she just watched my husband and I play it until she figured out how to, and now she loves to show us up!<br/>

Hi, we have 3 girls - 5, 3, and 7 months<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading this list for a while and read a lot about Minecraft, which I played a little but seems advanced for G5. Then recently I heard about Roblox which looks like 7 and over. G5 likes playing all the little games in Zoodles on my Mac, and G5 & G3 are consummate iPad users - they taught themselves how to do everything. G5 asks to purchase new iPad games all the time and lately I&#39;ve noted an up-tick in her ability to handle more complicated stuff. She had me purchase Cut The Rope and has worked through 4 boxes in 2 days. G3 tries to copy everything she does and does pretty well herself too on the creative/drawing games. G5 is also extremely social. Friends with everyone on block irregardless of age, and sends video emails to my parents daily.<br/>
