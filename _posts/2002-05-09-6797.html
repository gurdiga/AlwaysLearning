 </span></blockquote>Ummm.....speaking of gaps.<br/>
I&#39;m 37 and I don&#39;t know that I have *learned* about inertia yet.<br/>
Maybe it was covered in a chapter in school and I gave a right answer on a<br/>
test or something.<br/>
But I&#39;ve never specifically done an inertia experiment, just for the sake of<br/>
doing it, or for the sake of exposing my kids to it.<br/>
I suppose it will come up sooner or later, and maybe now that *inertia* has<br/>
come up in subject, I&#39;ll do a search on it to find out what it really is.<br/>
You see, I never thought about it before now!<br/>
<br/>
Everybody has gaps with one thing or another. Even the most knowledgeable<br/>
person in the world doesn&#39;t know EVERYTHING. So I&#39;m not concerned that I<br/>
can&#39;t or won&#39;t expose my kids to every little fact out there. I&#39;m just happy<br/>
to help them learn about things that interest them and help them make<br/>
connections about things they do know.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-447855287">My kids are 11 and 5. I was lousy in physics in school. This is how I&#39;ve<br/>
explained inertia so far (it&#39;s probably all they&#39;ll need to know unless they<br/>
specialize.)<br/>
<br/>
Newton&#39;s Laws of Physics<br/>
<br/>
First Law:  An object at rest tends to stay at rest and an object in motion<br/>
tends to stay in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless<br/>
acted upon by an unbalanced force.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Your sister will keep playing quietly unless you go in there and throw her<br/>
Barbies around. Stop messing with her equilibrium.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Second Law: Acceleration depends on the net force acting on the object as<br/>
well as the mass of the object.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I know she jumps higher if you pinch harder. Stop doing it anyway.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Third Law: For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well of course she hit you back. What did you expect?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I suppose I could use golf balls and ping pong balls and inclined planes<br/>
for all this, but IMO, physics applies to human relationships just as well!<br/>
And while this is slightly tongue in cheek, it really is how I&#39;ve explained<br/>
the three laws to my son. This way, he grokked it. Later, if he&#39;s<br/>
interested, we can do the experiments.<br/>
<br/>
Right now, he&#39;s fascinated by friction. He thinks it would be neat if he had<br/>
frictionless skates. That led to a discussion of gravity, and space, and the<br/>
three laws, and acceleration, and on and on.<br/>
<br/>
Since my daughter is the youngest and doesn&#39;t have anyone to pick on, I<br/>
guess she&#39;ll be at a learning disadvantage here... ;)<br/>

True!!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; But I&#39;ve never specifically done an inertia experiment, just for the sake <br/>
of<br/>
doing it, or for the sake of exposing my kids to it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I slammed the brakes on once to show Marty what could happen if he didn&#39;t use <br/>
a seatbelt.  I did it on our street, and with him behind a padded seat.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve closed our sliding van door by warning kids to hold on and then putting <br/>
the brakes on.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if it was a lesson, or it was just for fun and convenience (so <br/>
that I didn&#39;t have to park, get out, walk around, close the van door).  Now <br/>
that the kids are older, they want to wear seatbelts and they&#39;re all able to <br/>
close the door easily.  When they were littler sometimes they could get in <br/>
their carseats or seatbelts, but couldn&#39;t close the side door on the big Ford <br/>
van we had.<br/>
<br/>
The spirally vortex-plastic coin collecting things at the zoo and the museum <br/>
here (my vocabulary is great, huh??) where the coins go around and finally <br/>
down the hole is a cool physics toy.<br/>
<br/>
Playing red-light, green-light or freeze tag or swing a statue gives kids the <br/>
knowledge that they couldn&#39;t &quot;stop on a dime&quot; without moving.  So does roller <br/>
blading, and it&#39;s more than just reaction time.<br/>

I always say most of what&#39;s learned in school is just vocabulary.  As long as <br/>
kids have played with stuff and are aware of their muscles and getting the <br/>
idea about bones, and have paid attention to what&#39;s happening when they&#39;re <br/>
sick, and examined their sores and owies, have counted and measured and <br/>
gambled and joked and done parodies, then later when you want to talk about <br/>
force, vector, anatomy, white blood cells, infection, bookkeeping, odds and <br/>
statistics, tests and measures, rhyme, pun, satire... all you&#39;re doing is <br/>
giving them names for things they already know.<br/>
<br/>
FIRST play, goof, sing, guess, and THEN later (years later maybe) when the <br/>
term comes up and you really KNOW this kid you can say &quot;Like shutting the van <br/>
door by slamming on the brakes.&quot;<br/>
