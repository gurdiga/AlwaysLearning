<div id="ygrps-yiv-1118638361">I&#39;m a sole parent (we have absolutely no contact from my son&#39;s father, <br/>
and no financial support either) and I have been parenting my son <br/>
fulltime since his birth (no daycare.) I am in what I feel is a moral <br/>
dilemma in regard to unschooling as it would mean I would have to <br/>
remain on a government pension until my son is much older. There is <br/>
already alot of pressure from my family to return to work now, and he <br/>
is only 19 months old, so I can imagine the shock if I told them I <br/>
would be staying home all through DS&#39;s &#39;school years&#39; aswell. I was <br/>
wondering if there are any parents here who are also single/sole <br/>
parents and who are managing an unschooling lifestyle successfully? I <br/>
am already struggling sometimes financially, as the payment I receive <br/>
is very modest, therefore I am also concerned about providing rich and <br/>
varied experiences for DS as he grows. And I do feel badly about <br/>
relying on the government to get by, I would prefer to be self <br/>
sufficient. I have considered a home business but wonder how I would <br/>
juggle that whilst spending adequate time with my son, and also, I <br/>
have no skills (such as sewing etc) to create items to sell etc. So I <br/>
can&#39;t think of anything I could turn into a viable business. But the <br/>
alternative for DS (school) just seems so unappealing.<br/>
<br/>
Any experience welcome!</div>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been a single mama for 6.5 years. I&#39;ve no real contact with my kids&#39;<br/>
dad either, as he&#39;s dead I figure he&#39;s got a good excuse for his absence<br/>
:::vbg::: (really, you&#39;re supposed to chuckle, guilt-free, at that one!!)<br/>
I also have been living on a very modest government issued stipend and have<br/>
been able to provide a rich, fulfilling unschooling experience for our<br/>
family. It&#39;s not easy (so rarely anything worthwhile ever is) and it&#39;s worth<br/>
every bit of effort I put into it.  I struggle with my financial dependence<br/>
on the government, and I also realize that I&#39;m using this stipend in the way<br/>
it was originally intended: for widows to care for their orphaned children<br/>
themselves and not be forced into the workplace. I&#39;m also openly grateful to<br/>
those who contribute their hard-earned monies to FICA in order for me to<br/>
draw upon that fund for our lives (thanks for working so I don&#39;t have to!!).<br/>
I&#39;ve made lots of folks feel much better about that specific deduction as<br/>
they now hold a picture in their heads of where that money goes. I&#39;m<br/>
personally much happier to see my tax dollars go to an unschooler, present<br/>
and mindful parents, than to institutionalized child care subsidies &/or<br/>
schools. I know it can be hard to reconcile in your heart; you have to make<br/>
that shift yourself -- I hope you can, your son needs you present without<br/>
guilt nor resentment.<br/>
I&#39;m proactive with my family about what we need. What can I do? Well, H<br/>
needs new jeans or we&#39;d sure like a zoo membership or there&#39;s an art class<br/>
we&#39;ve been thinking about or even, we&#39;d sure like to try that new Indian<br/>
Restaurant... My birthday requests are often ones of *family gifts* like<br/>
memberships or games. The United Way has a great scholarship program in our<br/>
town that we can apply, once a year, to things like art lessons at the local<br/>
museum or summer day camp or swim lessons. There is reduced cost for summer<br/>
swim passes, classes offered through park and recreation. On super tight<br/>
months, I have no qualms calling my mom to let her know we&#39;d like some help<br/>
with meals for the rest of the month. Others in my group have offered<br/>
end-of-the-month dinners and outings to us on a regular basis. I&#39;ve scrimped<br/>
and juggled to get at least one vacation every year. Originally, we would<br/>
drive to California to see my in-laws (free room and board) as our annual<br/>
trip. I&#39;ve even managed to get us to Disneyland on a pretty regular basis.<br/>
Then, in 2004, I just *had to* (my own desire, not a life and death have to,<br/>
not a real must ::g::) get to Peabody, MA for the Live and Learn<br/>
Conference... That&#39;s all it took!! I was hooked!! From that moment on, I<br/>
realized we&#39;d now figure out how to get TWO vacations out of my finances<br/>
every year -- Grammas AND Conference! This September will be the 5th<br/>
unschooling conference we&#39;ve attended. Again, not easy, I&#39;ve had to swallow<br/>
some pride and ask for help -- what I&#39;ve found is that most folks<br/>
(especially in this unschooling universe) are willing to do whatever they<br/>
can to make this lifestyle possible for anyone willing to take it on. In the<br/>
past 12 months, Hayden and I have been on at least 12 roadtrips, some more<br/>
than 1,000 miles one way. Thankfully, we&#39;ve got amazing<br/>
friends-who-should-be-family all over the country who are willing to host us<br/>
for a few days in exchange for our entertaining company (and maybe some<br/>
karmic investment).<br/>
There are people in my dna family who will no longer speak to me because of<br/>
my refusal to *go mainstream* and &quot;just get a job and send Hayden to school&quot;<br/>
-- this life, this relationship, this JOY cannot/will not be traded for the<br/>
approval of any judgmental you-know-what who wouldn&#39;t be happy no matter<br/>
what I did that wasn&#39;t exactly what they did/do.  :::shrug::: We live a<br/>
rich, full life. If someone has something to contribute to it, they&#39;re<br/>
already here doing just that (or they&#39;re waiting to be met, just around the<br/>
next corner ::g::). If someone has nothing to contribute toward our happy<br/>
home, they&#39;re better off not here-- I don&#39;t have the energy to devote to<br/>
them, I&#39;m busy with *us*.<br/>
Sometimes those qualms sneak up and jump out at me. Then I remember what my<br/>
friend&#39;s 16.5 year old daughter said to me just after my own daughter&#39;s<br/>
death, &quot;When I add up all the hours spent in daycare and school, I realize I<br/>
have spent the whole of Hannah&#39;s (9.5y) life away from my mother, it&#39;s a<br/>
good thing Hannah had the whole of *her* life with her mom.&quot;  At the end of<br/>
*your* life what will you regret?? I sure hope it&#39;s not spending time with<br/>
your baby.<br/>
HTH :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1876244627">Thank you Diana, for this. I am not a solo mother. I am happily married <br/>
to a man I have been with for 38 years. I have 4 sons, 1 of whom still <br/>
lives at home (17yo). The furtherest any of the others lives is 2 1/2 <br/>
hours away. I see them lots.<br/>
<br/>
Yet I do not always live happily: your posts always awaken me to the <br/>
joys and blessings in my life. Thank you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-529104854">I can&#39;t say it better than Diana, but I can say that it is a much more <br/>
American approach to the world than it is a British approach or a Japanese <br/>
approach.<br/>
<br/>
Lying next to me on the couch is a letter from the HM Revenue and Customs <br/>
laying out my Tax Credits for being the primary caregiver to Simon and <br/>
Linnaea. I get £545.34 a year. That is mine. David and I get £120 every <br/>
month just for having 2 kids, if he made a milllion pounds a year we&#39;d still <br/>
get that money, Madonna and Guy will get that money. David, pure <br/>
happenstance, who is sitting on the other side of me on the couch is reading <br/>
from today&#39;s Telegraph that if you are a single mother (not a single <br/>
person), working 16 hours a week, including all of your tax credits you get <br/>
an additional £487 per week. That is a lot of money. That is almost 4000 <br/>
U.S. dollars a month.<br/>
<br/>
When we lived in Japan, where we weren&#39;t residents, we also got money for <br/>
having children. There wasn&#39;t any shame involved. It was across the board.<br/>
<br/>
I know friends who have been on the dole in the UK complain about what it is <br/>
like going into the unemployment office. David used to get unemployment when <br/>
he was a young man. He said the offices look much the same as they did in <br/>
The Full Monty. So there is a bit of public humiliation going on. But there <br/>
isn&#39;t the same kind of sense that it is a personal failing that you are <br/>
allowing the tax dollars of the working folk to pick up your tab, if you see <br/>
what I mean.<br/>
