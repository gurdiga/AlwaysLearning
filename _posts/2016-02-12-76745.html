<div id="ygrps-yiv-1320654557">Thank you for being here.  Today and yestedary I got three bits of positive feedback I wanted to share.<br/>
<br/>
By e-mail from someone who hasn’t posted (I don’t think):<br/>
___________<br/>
<br/>
I find the discussions on Always Learning enormously useful and with a depth, breadth and integrity that I highly respect. I know they have certainly helped me grow as a person and a parent and I&#39;m so grateful. <br/>
<br/>
____________<br/>
<br/>
From yesterday’s chat (after the chat, in the chatroom… chat continuation. ;-), two people:<br/>
<br/>
-=-I think I went thru a similar arc when I first found your writing - being shocked - and then listening to your voice somewhere helped - and only after lurking and reading for over a year am I starting to get to a place where I feel comfortable asking questions-=-<br/>
<br/>
and<br/>
<br/>
-=- I admire the way you quietly and patiently set people straight, but i don&#39;t like to think about yiu having more negativity in yiur life, thats why i asked… [asked about how I stay patient and keep participating in discussions]  But you aren&#39;t that hard to warm up to....it took a short time to adjust to the different style of the groups, etc....but that is sort of forewarned in pinned posts guidelines so not a huge shock.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Those might’ve been about this and Radical Unschooling Info (on facebook) or both.<br/>
<br/>
What I wanted to say is thanks for being here.  Thanks for being patient when I’m not, sometimes.<br/>

I know for us, this has been a most treasured resource and a place where I can come and get much needed perspective and clarity. Often, I will answer my own question before posting it, as I think through the types of responses I may have read here or on your website. It also helps me to read the questions of others, as you often point out, because sometimes that issue comes up later and I will already have some creative ideas in my toolbox. I am so grateful for your commitment to keeping things on track and also the quality of the discussions, so again, thank you!</span></font></blockquote><span style=""><br><br></span><div style="clear:both;"><span style=""></span></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-54443337fromDMARC" style="clear:both;margin-top:10px;"></div></span></blockquote></div><blockquote type="cite"><br>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-988252129">From something I just wrote on the side to someone—I thought it might be interesting to others, too.<br/>
<br/>
This group has over 76,000 posts now.  Here’s a quote of me:<br/>
<br/>
______________<br/>
<br/>
 And there are very few there that are fluff, or off topic, because that’s the way the group has always been. :-)<br/>

<br/>
It’s probably the best unschooling discussion that ever has been, or ever will be.  I didn’t know it when I started it, but I was in just about every one before that, and many people have come to this one, or come back to it after being in others, and said there’s nothing comparable. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I didn’t set out to creat the best discussion ever. :-)  And I wouldn’t have made that claim until recent years, but I do think it’s true.<br/>
