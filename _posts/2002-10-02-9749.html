<div id="ygrps-yiv-1369444002">I just found the &quot;photos&quot; on this site.  It was cool to put faces <br/>
with some of your names.  I am wondering why there are a couple of <br/>
handwriting samples there.  Anyone know?<br/>

So people could see handwriting samples!!  If you (or anyone) wants to add <br/>
something, try a John Holt quote so we get two for one, or some other cool <br/>
unschooling thing, and upload it!!<br/>
