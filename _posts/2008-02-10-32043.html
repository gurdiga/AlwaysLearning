<div id="ygrps-yiv-752906196">HI all -<br/>
In further conversations with my daughter, we&#39;ve come up with a plan for her to do what she wants NOW... instead of studying the biology for a future goal.... some conversations on this list triggered my memory of feeling like school was always preparing me for the next grade (&#39;you&#39;ll need this in 6th grade&#39;...&#39;you&#39;ll need this in high school&#39;... &#39;you&#39;ll need this skill in college&#39;... etc)<br/>
<br/>
So, aside from her pregnant horse, etc.  she says she wants to &#39;make a difference&#39; for the lives of animals... well, THAT she can do NOW without any degree or training!  <br/>
<br/>
So, we&#39;re going to volunteer at the animal shelter and get her hooked up as a &#39;dog walker&#39; in the neighborhood (for $$ and for the care of the animals)....<br/>
<br/>
This sounds much more fun!    We also got her hooked up for &#39;structured Biology&#39; to satisfy what is considered the typical body of knowledge that is called &#39;Biology&#39; but it is secondary to her living her life now.... and she is glad to be &#39;preparing for options in the future&#39; so I&#39;ll support her in that, too....<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all!<br/>
Jane<br/>
