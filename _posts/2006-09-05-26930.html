<div id="ygrps-yiv-1682413104">Hello everyone ! I am new to the group. My name is Tina and my family <br/>
and I live in Florida on the outskirts of Orlando. I have a 5 yr old <br/>
boy-Isaiah, an almost 4 in 2 wks girl - Maya, an 18 mo boy-Ezra, and <br/>
am due with another girl on the 23rd of this month. We unschool and I <br/>
love it! We dont plan on changing things! <br/>
My husband and I have been married for 8 yrs and have done some <br/>
traveling in that time. My husband-Andy has his own business as a <br/>
subcontractor, he also does home remodeling and tile and stuff like <br/>
that. I am an artist. I do tattoos, murals,and make all kinds of <br/>
crafty things. We are really free people and have embraced the <br/>
unschooling method generously. <br/>
Were into natural everything, ap, alternative medicine-I am planning a <br/>
homebirth, meditation and yoga, my girl and I bellydance. We love to <br/>
camp. We love modern technology and are very open minded people!<br/>
Im looking forward to being part of this group! One Love!</div>
