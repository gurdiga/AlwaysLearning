amount. Weird. Now I&#39;m waiting for the wrinkles :(<br/>

PS My hair is usually dyed pink or red or purple. Hides the grey a treat<br/>

I&#39;m 42, Craig is 49. I&#39;m dreading his 50th way more than any birthday I&#39;ve <br/>
ever had.<br/>
<br/>
I love the 40&#39;s EXCEPT - right at 40, lots of physical things got <br/>
problematic. It made getting older feel a bit more obvious.<br/>

What a wonderful celebration--sounds like you&#39;ll always have great memories of a milestone birthday. Hope you will have a lovely birthday closer to home. <br/>
