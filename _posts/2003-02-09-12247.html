Hi, Nancy --<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking about you and animal therapy the other day because the<br/>
guy who wrote Artemis Fowl was on the radio.  (A discussion about all<br/>
kinds of children&#39;s books.)  Apparently the first books he wrote were<br/>
very different in style and content (from Artemis) and some of them are<br/>
about using animals in therapy for traumatized children, in Africa.  I<br/>
believe these are based on his real life experiences.  I haven&#39;t read them.<br/>
