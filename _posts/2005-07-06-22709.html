So,  Connie, are you saying I should get OVER it? NEVER. I want my card <br/>

Oh, no, I&#39;m not saying that Pam!!!  I guess I&#39;m saying we have to  accept <br/>
change, but that doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t miss what used to be --- I too  loved the <br/>
card catalog.  I&#39;ve never been a speller - so I often &quot;needed&quot; to  search <br/>
through LOTS of cards to find what I was looking for, and what treasures  I would <br/>
find while doing that.<br/>
 <br/>
But, then, I now LOVE being able to go to the library website and request  <br/>
books that I want from other branches and then I get an e-mail lets me know when <br/>
 they are at my local library.  <br/>
 <br/>
But----I doubt if any of us will get our card catalogs back --- so you  don&#39;t <br/>
have to get over it, but maybe just accept it!  :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1137043573">Yeah, I know I&#39;m slow. :) But I couldn&#39;t resist the topic.<br/>
<br/>
My older kids (now 27 and 20) learned how to use a card catalog, my younger <br/>
kids (13) have never seen one in action that they can remember- our local <br/>
library retired theirs 9 years ago. I was so bummed about it at the time that I <br/>
almost bought one of the cabinets solely for the sake of nostalgia. I still miss <br/>
them in many ways - no more serendipitous finds while riffling through a <br/>
drawer, and subject searches seem much harder to me, I still can&#39;t scan screens as <br/>
fast or as easily as I had learned to scan cards. But I wouldn&#39;t willingly <br/>
give up the computer catalogs at this point. I can search the holdings of not <br/>
only my own library but 26 other libraries in the same cooperative system, and <br/>
put books on hold from any of them from my home. At midnight. On Sunday. &lt;g&gt; I <br/>
can keep the catalog page open as I read unschooling lists so I can quickly <br/>
find and order recommended books without having to try to remember titles or <br/>
write myself a note I&#39;ll forget to take to the library with me. I can search the <br/>
holdings of every single library in the state of Illinois and send an email to <br/>
my reference librarian requesting an interlibrary loan, right here from my <br/>
comfy chair, and it will show up at my library with my name on it usually within <br/>
a few days. What luxury!<br/>
<br/>
My 13 year olds don&#39;t know how to use card catalogs, but they do know how to <br/>
do computer catalog searches very well. AND they both memorized their 14 digit <br/>
library card codes in order to place to their own reserves by the time they <br/>
were 9. :) <br/>
<br/>
Someone mentioned browsing other&#39;s selections on the reserve shelf - you <br/>
couldn&#39;t do that here. The one local library that puts reserves out on a public <br/>
shelf for pickup wraps the whole book in white paper before labeling it with the <br/>
patron&#39;s name. I guess someone complained about privacy...<br/>
