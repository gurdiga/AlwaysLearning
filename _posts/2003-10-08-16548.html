<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Why is it that parents don&#39;t want their kids to pursue the same career?  My<br/>
&gt; mom was very artistic in school, and won a scholarship to a prestigious art<br/>
&gt; school in L.A.  (For stupidly dysfunctional family reasons, she wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; permitted to accept.)  Mom *hated* my sister&#39;s passion for both painting and<br/>
&gt; ballet, and was furious when I changed majors from advertising to graphic<br/>
&gt; design.  Maybe that Albert Brooks movie, &quot;Mother,&quot; holds the answer -- the<br/>
&gt; frustration of a failed or aborted career makes a parent so jealous they<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t support their child in the same career?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Or maybe, because we&#39;ve been there, we can see all the problems with that<br/>
career, and all the pitfalls on the way.  The mothering instinct makes us<br/>
want to protect our children from having to deal with the same garbage we<br/>
did.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a musician, and it&#39;s difficult to bite my tongue when my son dreams of<br/>
being an organist, a concert pianist, a choir boy.  For heaven&#39;s sake, kid,<br/>
pick a career with a little more money in it!<br/>
