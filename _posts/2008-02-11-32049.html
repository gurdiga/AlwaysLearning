<div id="ygrps-yiv-1706310705">Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to get your thoughts and ideas about helping my son have a  <br/>
fun experience with YouTube.  He loves creating videos and sharing  <br/>
them, but the social aspect of the whole YouTube community is  <br/>
confusing to him.  I&#39;ve been trying to learn more so that I can assist  <br/>
him, but much of it is confusing to me as well.<br/>
<br/>
Are any of your kids involved with YouTube and if so, is there a way  <br/>
to connect into that group of kids?  I just feel that there&#39;s got to  <br/>
be some unschooling kids having fun with making videos and sharing  <br/>
them with each other.  My son&#39;s YouTube account is GamerGuy628 if you  <br/>
want to check it out.  He&#39;d LOVE it if some other unschoolers  <br/>
commented, asked to be his friend or subscribed to his channel!<br/>
<br/>
He really wants people to watch his videos and comment and become  <br/>
subscribers, but doesn&#39;t know how to bring people to his channel.   <br/>
I&#39;ve tried to explain the viral effect of the videos that get watched  <br/>
a lot, but that&#39;s not satisfying him.  He&#39;s gotten some rude comments  <br/>
and those who have wanted to join aren&#39;t kids but mostly teens and  <br/>
older with some pretty weird stuff on their own channels.  I&#39;ve talked  <br/>
to him about the fact that YouTube leans more to older people (My son  <br/>
is 9) and that maybe there was a site out there that was similar to  <br/>
YouTube but geared for a younger set.  If you know of any, please let  <br/>
me know.<br/>
<br/>
YouTube has been a very creative and expansive experience for him.  He  <br/>
is an artist and has a passion for creating both animation and live  <br/>
videos.  Though he is a novice, I&#39;ve been really amazed with all that  <br/>
he has picked up just by watching other videos and trying different  <br/>
ideas out for himself.  Most of his humor is  pretty typical 9 year  <br/>
old boy bathroom humor and probably wouldn&#39;t be appreciated by uptight  <br/>
moms!   That&#39;s one of the reasons we haven&#39;t shared them with many of  <br/>
our more traditional family friends.  But I&#39;m sure there are families  <br/>
in this community who would appreciate his humor and artist talents!<br/>
<br/>
This is all a big learning curve for both of us.  Any thoughts would  <br/>
be helpful!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Our experience in getting views on videos has a lot to do with content, <br/>
what you name it and what music you put in it.  My daughter&#39;s most <br/>
popular video, which just mysteriously disappeared last week, had tons <br/>
of views and was favorited by a lot of people because of the content.  <br/>
It was a Naruto video, which are pretty popular, and the title was <br/>
Naruto and Hinata, which is a very popular video search for Naruto <br/>
videos.  Her music choice brought viewers too, and people liked her <br/>
video because of the content, just as much as for what music she chose <br/>
to put with it.  There are tons of Naruto and Hinata videos, but hers <br/>
had cool music.<br/>
<br/>
So, if he wants views, he needs to name it something interesting that <br/>
includes a common search theme, and put into the video description the <br/>
music title of whatever music he puts in his video, if any.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter and I will check out his videos...<br/>
Good Luck!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-95807606">Add more tags, too. On one of his videos his tags are &#39;peach&#39; and<br/>
&#39;mario&#39; he could also add &#39;stick figures&#39;, &#39;unschooler&#39; as tags or<br/>
whatever else he can think of that is relevant to the video. Another<br/>
thing to do is post videos in reply to other videos that have a lot of<br/>
views. This will drive traffic to his channel.<br/>
<br/>
He could find other unschoolers by doing a search for &#39;unschoolers&#39; on youtube.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps,<br/>
<br/>
