<div id="ygrps-yiv-1177723084">So, for Pam Hartley (take a deep breath first!!) and Mary Gold and others <br/>
here, I&#39;m off looking on google for other people&#39;s pro-gaming articles <br/>
already online (if they exist, which I hope) to link to, and I find the <br/>
following:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;3) Begin slowly. Don&#39;t settle on a permanent curriculum or program for <br/>
several weeks to several months. Take time to fully research your options. in <br/>
the meantime, institute the following program with your children: daily <br/>
journal writing (at least a one-page detailing of the previous day&#39;s events, <br/>
dictated if the student is not yet writing); daily reading (student-selected <br/>
library books-keep a lot of these!); 20-30 rninutes of math (less for K-1) <br/>
using math workbooks from a teacher supply store or even the supermarket; <br/>
30-60 minutes of household chores each day; no TV or Nintendo during the day; <br/>
outdoor exercise, play, and/or yardwork daily; plenty of &#39;unschooling&quot; or <br/>
decompression time when the student can pursue his interests or simply lie on <br/>
the grass and look at the clouds, ifs/he wants to! For older children, start <br/>
looking for volunteer opportunities in libraries, museums, drama groups, <br/>
hospitals, etc. Do fun, family things: read aloud together, play board games, <br/>
do puzzles, cook together, etc.&quot;<br/>

Thanks for the recommendation about the deep breath, I was able to primal<br/>
scream a LOT louder and longer than I would have otherwise! &lt;gg&gt;<br/>

<br/>
We&#39;re rearing a new game enthusiast here at the Hartley Homestead -- the<br/>
article coming out in this months HSC newsletter details her early<br/>
adventures. ;) I&#39;ll find out what the publication&#39;s rules are on such things<br/>
and post it here if I can.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll just &lt;sigh&gt; and ::roll my eyes::  These people should just meet and <br/>
talk to our kids some day. Better yet, they should talk to just about every <br/>
gaming adult I&#39;ve ever met. There is alsways MUCH thinking going on.<br/>

Life is good.<br/>
