<div id="ygrps-yiv-1778177757">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;What do you mean by &#39;blanks&#39;? Freezing up and not<br/>
talking? Becoming <br/>
non-commuicative to the point that she can&#39;t answer?<br/>
She mentally <br/>
removes <br/>
herself from the situation? Both of my kids have a<br/>
behavior we call <br/>
&quot;shutting down&quot;. It usually comes out during stress,<br/>
but not always. It <br/>
would be interesting to see if they&#39;re doing the same<br/>
thing.<br/>
<br/>
~Mary&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like she becomes non-communicative to the point<br/>
that she won&#39;t answer unless prompted, and then it&#39;s<br/>
very cursory or barely audible. Shutting down is quite<br/>
a good term, but do your kids &#39;shut down&#39; for a few<br/>
seconds whilst responding to someone and then run off<br/>
and play with a friend in full on &#39;happy&#39; mode again?<br/>
I could understand it more if she were doing it in<br/>
stressful situations, but she&#39;s not (on occasion yes,<br/>
but not always). I&#39;m just baffled by it. Everytime I<br/>
try to make sense of it, my theory (for lack of a<br/>
better term) gets blown. Sometimes she will be very<br/>
friendly and outgoing to a stranger (like in a store)<br/>
and then she&#39;ll turn around and blank someone else<br/>
(stranger or no) the next minute. There really doesn&#39;t<br/>
seem to be any rhyme or reason to it. It&#39;s not like it<br/>
happens all the time, just often enough for me to be<br/>
getting fed up with it.<br/>

overlaod, or memory overload, or some kind of overload that isn&#39;t apparent<br/>
from the outside and she&#39;s shutting down for processing.<br/>
<br/>
Ask her what it feels like when it starts and while she&#39;s in it. Ask her<br/>
what gets her out of it. Does she feel released when the person stops<br/>
talking? What&#39;s going through her mind while it&#39;s happening? Right before it<br/>
happens? When she starts to come out of it?<br/>
<br/>
I think if you forget how you feel about it and how you feel others must<br/>
feel about it and only concentrate on how *she* feels about it, you&#39;ll get<br/>
more insight. If it doesn&#39;t bother her, then just treat it as an interesting<br/>
puzzle. Ask questions occasionally if you think you might have a new insight<br/>
so she feels you&#39;re available but set it aside as *her* puzzle to solve.<br/>
(Unless, of course, it increases in frequency.)<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know how much of it is deliberate or not. I do<br/>
know that when I draw her attention to it, she<br/>
sometimes makes more of an effort to be civil and<br/>
sometimes she doesn&#39;t. In some situations (especially<br/>
with other children) it can be quite hurtful behaviour<br/>
(to the person receiving her &#39;coldness&#39;, that is). I<br/>
think that &#39;coldness&#39; is actually a better description<br/>
of it.  She doesn&#39;t space out or anything, but she<br/>
kind of cops an attitude of &#39;I&#39;m not going to talk to<br/>
you&#39;. I wonder if it&#39;s some sort of weird power<br/>
struggle? But against what? But I still *feel* fed up<br/>
with it (although I try not to *act* fed up &lt;g&gt;).<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ll try asking some of these questions next time<br/>
we&#39;re in a &#39;situation&#39;. I have asked her how or what<br/>
she&#39;s feeling when it happens but she always says, &quot;I<br/>
don&#39;t know&quot;. I&#39;ll try asking her some of the more<br/>
specific questions that you suggested, it may help her<br/>
to realise what she&#39;s thinking about while it&#39;s<br/>
happening and we might get some insight into it.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t worry about how it affects others unless it&#39;s<br/>
hurtful. Unfortunately, as of late it seems to be<br/>
getting more and more hurtful to people. Maybe it&#39;s<br/>
because she&#39;s older and it&#39;s now perceived as more<br/>
socially unacceptable? It didn&#39;t seem to be quite so<br/>
much of an issue in England. Maybe it&#39;s a societal<br/>
thing and I&#39;m feeling the pressure of it and<br/>
tranferring it to her? Maybe I&#39;m just blowing it all<br/>
out of proportion and it&#39;s not such a big deal and<br/>
she&#39;ll outgrow it like you suggested. Maybe I&#39;m just<br/>
being neurotic &lt;bwg&gt;.<br/>

<br/>
That may be the total truth.<br/>
<br/>
I have an acquaintance (wife of a friend) who is VERY much that way.  She <br/>
just zones away, in what seems a very snooty way, but what is probably either <br/>
a deep, short panic or some autism kind of thing.  Seriously, she fit the <br/>
description someone put up a while back on... unschooling.com probably.  it <br/>
was people who process almost exclusively by written word, maybe math and <br/>
music, but NOT physical, including not any physical clues.  Pictures are <br/>
rejected.  TV is rejected.  Words on paper or math ONLY.  These are the <br/>
SAT-scoring idiot-savants who are considered in this culture to be plenty <br/>
bright, since this culture doesn&#39;t count social skills as intelligence (yet, <br/>
not yet).<br/>
<br/>
So... this person&#39;s in her 20&#39;s and maybe will grow out of it.  I hope.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It sounds like it may be dissociative to me. I do that. I can just sort<br/>
of pull away and really not be *here* anymore. When I was a traumatized<br/>
teen, I could spend literally hours sitting and staring at a wall... I<br/>
suppose I still could, but I don&#39;t need to anymore. Still, I get<br/>
overwhelmed by crowds, even nice crowds, and I have to make a real effort<br/>
to stay *here* sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
Cacie, I think, has a similar ability but has her dad&#39;s social skills, so<br/>
she usually likes to go make friends with new people and is better at it.<br/>
I do remember that when she was 4, she used to &quot;watch&quot; videos on the<br/>
backs her her eyelids during long car trips, and I think it&#39;s related.<br/>
