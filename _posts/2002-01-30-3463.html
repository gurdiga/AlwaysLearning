&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hmmm. I don&#39;t like the way many classes for homeschooler are done,<br/>
&gt;especially when they&#39;re done in a &quot;school-ish&quot;,or a developmentally<br/>
&gt;inappropriate way.  I don&#39;t have a problem with classes in general,<br/>
&gt;though. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t have a problem with some classes, like the ones we get at the <br/>
zoo or the botanic garden.  Since I only have one kid left, I always <br/>
volunteer to be the parent in the room if necessary.  Most places around <br/>
here only want one, but some let all the parents stay.  I don&#39;t do <br/>
classes done by other homeschoolers for most of the reasons you stated. <br/>
 We have a good Campfire group, and as soon as the over-controlling <br/>
current leader leaves and I take over, it&#39;s going to get way more <br/>
relaxed and fun.  THAT turned in to too much like school, and her <br/>
partner&#39;s formerly cool homeschooled children had become little <br/>
syncophants since she took over the parenting.  ::getting the willies <br/>
just thinking about it:::  Poor kids had to cope somehow.  <br/>
<br/>
I did get to volunteer with my boy Will&#39;s Zoo Academy class, and I went <br/>
to the orientation a few weeks ago, and it&#39;s not going to be at all like <br/>
I feared, with sentence writing and all that.  There was only one <br/>
workbook page, and her plan was to use only the picture on it (a <br/>
humpback whale) and to cut that out and not fill in the blanks.  Will <br/>
eagerly did that first set of questions, and then a few days ago he <br/>
asked me if he *had* to do the other set.  Of course not, is what I <br/>
said.  ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-295972673">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
It would be silly to leave this list, I thought, so I didn&#39;t. And I&#39;ll do<br/>
my best to be gentle and humble. I usually am, really :-) . Oh yes, AND<br/>
logical. <br/>
<br/>
And I did learn a lot from the previous discussion.<br/>
<br/>
The most important things: <br/>
<br/>
1. I *must* introduce myself before posting, so people will know where I&#39;m<br/>
coming from. I&#39;m a programmer/linguist/musician, have read all of Holt<br/>
(many times over), almost all of Ivan Illich, and every book on<br/>
unschooling I could find. I like radical unschooling (and &#39;most anything<br/>
radical ;-) ) My daughter is 4. I&#39;m from Russia, English is my second<br/>
language, so I really didn&#39;t know &quot;that honoring feelings business&quot; was<br/>
derogatory. I thought it simply meant &quot;what they say about honoring<br/>
feelings&quot;. I have to &quot;watch my phrasology&quot; (from &quot;The Music Man&quot;, too :-)<br/>
), but first I have to use it and be corrected. (I love it when people<br/>
correct my language; Americans are usually too polite to do it in a<br/>
face-to-face conversation.)<br/>
<br/>
2. I must state my goals before posting. Here they are: to ask many<br/>
questions and to listen to answers. I don&#39;t like arguing at all, so I when<br/>
I ask a question, I really just want to ask a question, not to challenge.<br/>
When I make a statement, I don&#39;t try to convince. If your view is<br/>
different, I&#39;ll read it with great interest, but won&#39;t try to defend mine.<br/>
Defending my opinions in this particular situation is not important to me.<br/>
I&#39;ll defend just a few statements, but it&#39;s a lot more interesting to me<br/>
to bring up related issues and get deeper into the subject. I feel I&#39;ll<br/>
learn more that way at this time. That&#39;s a good strategy for children and<br/>
inexperienced people -- to ask lots of questions and listen. I wish I<br/>
always were wise enough to do what I think is best :-) .<br/>
<br/>
A wise child asks one thousand questions,<br/>
An unwise, only one hundred and three <br/>
(from some Persian poet...;-)... that &quot;Music Man&quot; sure is sticky)<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t like to talk to people with these conversational goals,<br/>
it&#39;s okay if you don&#39;t talk to me. If you think people shouldn&#39;t post on<br/>
this list if they have goals like that, please explain why. <br/>
<br/>
*************<br/>
Okay on to the discussion:<br/>
The thing is, this discussion is extremely important to me. Because I have<br/>
always thought that state-owned schooling and big corporation owned TV are<br/>
BOTH things to be avoided. And I&#39;m really interested in this connection<br/>
between school and TV as institutional tools. That&#39;s just one reason I&#39;m<br/>
posting here, and not on some anti-tv list. If you want to know the other<br/>
reasons, please ask! :-)<br/>
<br/>
There are LOTSA issues here, and it would be nice to keep them separate:<br/>
<br/>
****Is there a difference between watching TV and videos or home movies?<br/>
<br/>
My answer: Yes. It&#39;s easy to make a movie (some kind of movie) and hard to<br/>
become a TV broadcaster (see about convivial tools below). It easy to find<br/>
a good movie (go to imdb.org and read reviews), it&#39;s harder to find a good<br/>
TV show (if they have any lasting value, they&#39;ll be available on videotape<br/>
at the library). I can list more if anyone wants to hear.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s your answer?<br/>
<br/>
****Is it okay to not have a TV and use the library to check out some TV<br/>
shows on videotapes?<br/>
<br/>
My answer: Yes. That&#39;s what libraries are for. We pay taxes, overdue fines<br/>
and donate, and then we get to use books, magazines, videos, etc. without<br/>
having to buy them.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s your answer?<br/>
<br/>
****Is TV a tool no better or worse than other tools? <br/>
<br/>
My answer:  I don&#39;t think all tools are equally valuable. I kinda feel it<br/>
intuitively, but I started thinking about it with more clarity after<br/>
reading &quot;Tools for Conviviality&quot; by Ivan Illich (author of &quot;Deschooling<br/>
Society&quot; and a major influence on John Holt). Basically more convivial<br/>
tools have more of these features: <br/>
	* one-to-one communication <br/>
        * low cost <br/>
	* easy to use <br/>
	* widely available <br/>
	* entrenched <br/>
        * surveillance-resistant <br/>
	* censorship-resistant <br/>
	* disruption-resistant<br/>
<br/>
So, &quot;The Net is only the latest in convivial communication media. Most of<br/>
these features are found in face-to-face conversations, the postal system<br/>
and the telephone system. In contrast, broadcast television is one of the<br/>
least convivial media. It is one-to-many communication and, while cheap<br/>
and easy to use as a viewer, is extremely expensive and technically<br/>
challenging to be a broadcaster. &quot;<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://english.uq.edu.au/mc/reviews/features/politics/convivial-c.html)">http://english.uq.edu.au/mc/reviews/features/politics/convivial-c.html)</a><br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t have Illich&#39;s book handy, but the above is in his spirit.<br/>
<br/>
What do you say? Does ANYONE think tools are not all equal? If you do,<br/>
please post!<br/>
<br/>
****Whether or not TV is a good tool, do you think that tool is used well<br/>
most of the time?<br/>
<br/>
My answer: <br/>
No. I think most shows are produced by big corporations and serve their<br/>
interests in one way or another. I think I&#39;ll list the ways they serve<br/>
those interests later. That is, if anyone cares to ask.<br/>
<br/>
What do you think?<br/>
<br/>
****Whether or not all of the above is true, do you think TV is more<br/>
addictive than other communication media?<br/>
<br/>
My answer: No. Writing letters to email lists is much more addictive... oh<br/>
god I really should go to bed....<br/>
<br/>
****___IF___ someone believes at least one of the above is true, do you<br/>
think it&#39;s logical for them to ditch the TV?<br/>
<br/>
My answer:<br/>
Yes, in most cases.<br/>
I&#39;ll elaborate later.<br/>
****Are children who grew up without the TV more or less likely to get<br/>
addicted in adulthood?<br/>
<br/>
My answer:<br/>
Very hard to tell. Could be a factor, but there are lots of other<br/>
factors at play.<br/>
<br/>
****Is a child likely to share your convictions?<br/>
<br/>
My answer:<br/>
Yes, those that you&#39;re most passionate about. From my own and my friends&#39;<br/>
experience. Not guaranteed, but very likely. But does depend on<br/>
personality, the way you talk about your convictions etc. etc.<br/>
<br/>
****If a child has developed a conviction opposing yours, should you help<br/>
him to further his attachment to it?<br/>
<br/>
My answer:<br/>
It&#39;s natural and good to first try (once again ;-) ) to explain your<br/>
conviction. Then it&#39;s natural and good (if you think your conviction is<br/>
true -- but why else would you hold it?) to just point out resources from<br/>
which he might learn more, and let him learn by experience, and not help<br/>
him actively.<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
and many many more issues I&#39;ll try to single out later.<br/>
<br/>
Boy, am I sleepy... Boy, do I have a lot to say on each one of those...<br/>
And boy do I hope it&#39;s going to be a nice discussion.<br/>
<br/>
Love unschooling!<br/>

<br/>
The only complaint I have is the statement in advance that you don&#39;t intend <br/>
to defend your statements, and so I will make a counter request:<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t make any statements you can&#39;t or won&#39;t defend on this list to the 150+ <br/>
people who have come to learn.<br/>
<br/>
Linguist and programmer and not logical?  That&#39;s not logical! <br/>
Your English is really good for a non-native.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And I&#39;m really interested in this connection<br/>
between school and TV as institutional tools.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s best for unschoolers NOT to dwell on school.<br/>
So if you only like the discussions that are about school, maybe a list for <br/>
newer homeschoolers, whose kids are just out of school, would be best for <br/>
your purposes.<br/>
<br/>
It seems most unschoolers were other kinds of homeschoolers before coming to <br/>
this, and so their kids are rarely fresh out of school.  It&#39;s too great a <br/>
jump for most people to understand.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Basically more convivial<br/>
tools have more of these features: <br/>
    * one-to-one communication <br/>
        * low cost <br/>
    * easy to use <br/>
    * widely available <br/>
    * entrenched <br/>
        * surveillance-resistant <br/>
    * censorship-resistant <br/>
    * disruption-resistant&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think by &quot;tool&quot; people here mean scissors, a hammer, a sewing machine, a <br/>
television.  Things which are not people, but are things people might choose <br/>
to use for their own purposes (and by that I mean the viewer, not the evil <br/>
corporation you seem to see).<br/>
<br/>
Why does &quot;entrenchment&quot; make a tool (whatever your definition of &quot;tool&quot; is) <br/>
better?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It is one-to-many communication and, while cheap<br/>
and easy to use as a viewer, is extremely expensive and technically<br/>
challenging to be a broadcaster.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t change the value of Zoom to kids who like Zoom.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I think I&#39;ll list the ways they serve<br/>
those interests later. That is, if anyone cares to ask.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What do you think?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think that unless you&#39;re an experienced unschooler or intending to become o<br/>
ne, I&#39;m still angry about Monday being such a huge social trainwreck for the <br/>
other people on the list.<br/>
<br/>
Yahoo lists can be started by anyone.  This one was started by me, to discuss <br/>
serious unschooling.   It&#39;s as though I invited anyone who wanted to come to <br/>
a party, but that doesn&#39;t mean newcomers to the party have the right to <br/>
insult all the guests and tear down the house.  It&#39;s ALWAYS polite, when <br/>
coming into any situation of any sort, to stand on the edge and observe, to <br/>
get the tone and rhythm of what&#39;s going on, to see what IS before you jump in <br/>
the middle with what ought to be.  (Unless you&#39;re a policeman sent to break <br/>
the party up, and this party had no need of being broken up.)<br/>
<br/>
If you approach a sporting event, stand and watch a while before even asking <br/>
the other spectators what&#39;s going on.  Don&#39;t jump out on the field and grab <br/>
the ball.  You won&#39;t get a good reaction.<br/>
<br/>
Before we discuss your question about whether all tools are made equal, it <br/>
would help for you to define &quot;tool,&quot; and if it doesn&#39;t match the normal <br/>
definition of tool, it will be pretty hard to discuss it.<br/>

I know I&#39;m not there yet, but I don&#39;t see that I have much of a choice in the matter.  My kids have decided for me that we are going to be the best unschoolers we can be.  I would rather do something that came with instructions, it suits my personality.  The more control I give to my kids, the more I am amazed how well this unschooling thing works.  In the past month I have removed, TV limits, a set bedtime,  control over ear piercing, control over dessert, required math, and an on-going battle over table manners.  <br/>

I&#39;m ready to move on to the next level.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-984702431">I agree with what everyone so far has said about reopening the whole tv<br/>
debate. BTDT, I didn&#39;t feel like a real learning dialogue was going on<br/>
anyway, and I don&#39;t feel like going there again. Plus, a friend of mine<br/>
who really is trying to learn about unschooling but isn&#39;t there yet and<br/>
was pretty open about where she is got sort of caught in the crossfire,<br/>
felt hurt and attacked and unsubbed. And that makes me unhappy, because I<br/>
had told her this was a safe place to learn. So we had a long talk about<br/>
it at the park yesterday, but I&#39;m still sad.<br/>

&gt; *****<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s telling that no where in this decription is the possibility<br/>
that your child&#39;s conviction is true and yours is in error, and perhaps a<br/>
parent should be open to new ideas and should also try to find out more.<br/>
I am not infallible. Sure, I&#39;ll talk about where I&#39;m coming from, but I<br/>
know that I&#39;m not always right.<br/>
<br/>
When the PETA thing came up with Cacie (and she originally learned about<br/>
PETA through a tv show, some Dateline-type thing with a vet being tried<br/>
for cruelty to animals, and the star witness was a PETA member who had<br/>
taken a job as a vet tech so she could secretly videotape<br/>
stuff...although in this case I think the vet was abusive... anyway, just<br/>
an aside) I&#39;m the one who went to find the websites when she wanted to<br/>
know more about them, and read them  myself, and read some bits out to<br/>
her. Not just the totally wacky stuff, either.  My<br/>
writing-typing-internet skills were much better, first, but also I didn&#39;t<br/>
know everything about the group, either,  and I figured it was quite<br/>
possible that what I&#39;d heard was exaggerated, or only part of the story.<br/>
Not that the whole thing changed my mind, or hers, but I honestly looked<br/>
at it (and the People for the Eating of Tasty Animals totally cracked me<br/>
up, BTW). Actively. Just because I disagree, doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;ll just bow<br/>
out and let Cacie sink or float on her own...<br/>
<br/>
I guess the only exception would be enabling something I felt was morally<br/>
evil - I wouldn&#39;t drive her to KKK meetings, for example. OTOH, I would<br/>
help her find their website, and learn more about them with her. I&#39;d<br/>
probably drive her to a PETA meeting, though...<br/>

The ear piercing one was interesting.  When I was growing up I could not get my ears pierced until I was 16.  So when asked when dd could get hers pierced, originally I said I thought 13 would be fair.  I don&#39;t know what brought it up but a few days ago my 10 yo dd asked when she could get her ears pierced.  I said &quot;gee let&#39;s think about why I said we should wait until 13&quot;.  I told her when I was growing up wearing makeup and getting your ears pierced was for girls that were old enough to date.  She said she just liked wearing a little jewelry.  I explained how she would need to pay for whatever she needed herself and do what needs to be done to take care of her newly pierced ears.  I couldn&#39;t think of one good reason to make her wait.  Why had I said 13 in the past?<br/>
<br/>
This brings to mind something I had not thought about before.  Now that we are unschoolers, I will not be able to arbitrarily set an age my dds will be allowed to date.  I&#39;m going to have to trust them!!! (screaming) <br/>

<br/>
But they won&#39;t be in the culture of people talking about who went out and <br/>
who&#39;s going steady and all that.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby has only been on one real date.  He used his own money and he and a <br/>
teenaged girl walked to a restaurant and ate.  Her family was at our house <br/>
during that time.  He was 14.<br/>
<br/>
But MANY times he has been out in mixed groups of kids, to movies, to <br/>
restaurants, to play games at someone&#39;s house, to go to the anime club <br/>
meeting that is after hours in a comic book store (midnight to 3:00 a.m. on <br/>
Fridays) and they come in very late, or he e-mails and tells me he&#39;s at <br/>
Pat&#39;s, or Eric&#39;s (the regular places) and I check e-mail whenever his bed&#39;s <br/>
empty.<br/>
<br/>
That all came gradually, though.  It was never &quot;What are the abiding, overall <br/>
rules?&quot;  It was &quot;Can I do this one thing?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Okay.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Can I do a similar thing, with the following people?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Okay.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
BUT:<br/>
He has never failed to notify, has never lied about where he was, bring back <br/>
the change if he took money, etc.  Gradually I have come to really trust him.<br/>
<br/>
When he starts going out alone with girls in cars, I might have a whole <br/>
&#39;nother set of fears and feelings.  But I think letting him try beforehand <br/>
with just guys, and mixed groups, can&#39;t have hurt.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-628042778">Holly got her ears pierced when she was seven.  It was just before her 8th <br/>
birthday.  We went to the mall.<br/>
<br/>
Her dad didn&#39;t want her to, but said it was her choice.  She thought about it <br/>
for a long time, and talked to him another couple of times and he said he <br/>
thought it was a bad idea, but they were her ears.<br/>
<br/>
So she did.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s sensitive to stuff, and even the fancy earrings bother her ears.  So <br/>
she let them heal up. <br/>
<br/>
Then she decided she wanted them pierced again, about a year later.  A friend <br/>
had some hypodermics of local anesthetic (like paramedics have?) and was <br/>
going to give her a shot there, to be able to gently re-pierce through the <br/>
same hole (so she wouldn&#39;t have a messy big hole, or whatever--we didn&#39;t <br/>
trust the mall piercers to care).  <br/>
<br/>
He ended up using the needle to make the hole.  She took really good care of <br/>
them for a while, but even with using the stuff often, they&#39;d ooze.   So now <br/>
she puts earrings in occasionally, to keep the holes open, and to see if as <br/>
she gets older the problem is less.<br/>
<br/>
I can pick earrings up off the ground and stick them in, nothing bothers my <br/>
ears, except I just don&#39;t much like earrings because they get in my way and <br/>
tangled up in my hair (which is just straight and long).<br/>
<br/>
If we had made her wait, I think she would have put lots of energy into <br/>
thinking about it, being impatient, glorifying it, and maybe then being <br/>
really disappointed by infections.  She&#39;s ten, and it&#39;s not a big deal for <br/>
her one way or another.<br/>

I spent a few months blasting school every chance I got. Now I don&#39;t feel <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-456836476">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I renamed the thread to clarify the subject. By tools I mean things people<br/>
choose to use for their purposes, just like Sandra said.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> On Wed, 30 Jan 2002 <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:SandraDodd@...">SandraDodd@...</a> wrote:<br/>
<br/>
.... [in re to Ari&#39;s summary of the chapter about communication tools<br/>
from Ivan Illich&#39;s book &quot;Tools for Conviviality&quot;:]<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;Basically more convivial<br/>
&gt; tools have more of these features: <br/>
&gt;     * one-to-one communication <br/>
&gt;         * low cost <br/>
&gt;     * easy to use <br/>
&gt;     * widely available <br/>
&gt;     * entrenched <br/>
&gt;         * surveillance-resistant <br/>
&gt;     * censorship-resistant <br/>
&gt;     * disruption-resistant&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think by &quot;tool&quot; people here mean scissors, a hammer, a sewing machine, a <br/>
&gt; television.  Things which are not people, but are things people might choose <br/>
&gt; to use for their own purposes (and by that I mean the viewer, not the evil <br/>
&gt; corporation you seem to see).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
******************<br/>
Oh, I think I missed the word &quot;communication&quot; up there,<br/>
it should be something like &quot;more convivial communication tools&quot;... so<br/>
things compared are personal communication, telephone communication,<br/>
computer networks, radio, tv, books, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Illich talks about tools in general, though. E.g., cars, bicycles, drugs<br/>
of various types, guns, etc. And it&#39;s actually very interesting to include<br/>
all kinds of tools. For example, cars are not too convivial &#39;cause their<br/>
use changes the landscape, so it becomes less people-friendly, and changes<br/>
the concept of accessible distance, so people &quot;lose the use of their own<br/>
two feet&quot;, etc. <br/>
****************<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Why does &quot;entrenchment&quot; make a tool (whatever your definition of &quot;tool&quot; is) <br/>
&gt; better?<br/>
<br/>
**********<br/>
I think Illich and other writers use entrenched to mean &quot;one that has been<br/>
used for a long time&quot;, and it&#39;s better for a communication tool because<br/>
more people know how to use it, for example, so the rules about using it <br/>
are clearer, etc.<br/>
**********<br/>
<br/>
&gt; [about TV]<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;It is one-to-many communication and, while cheap<br/>
&gt; and easy to use as a viewer, is extremely expensive and technically<br/>
&gt; challenging to be a broadcaster.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That doesn&#39;t change the value of Zoom to kids who like Zoom.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
***********<br/>
<br/>
Well, Zoom is not TV, right? I think it&#39;s way easier to make a game like<br/>
Zoom than to become a major TV broadcaster.<br/>
<br/>
Illich&#39;s point is, some tools are designed to be less convivial, that is<br/>
they are &quot;worse&quot; from the beginning. So, TV, for example, is not<br/>
censorship-resistant, surveillance-resistant, and not easy to use as a<br/>
broadcaster (only easy for the viewer). And the Internet, e.g. is. (Illich<br/>
doesn&#39;t actually talk about TV vs the Internet, he mentions TV and<br/>
&quot;computer networks&quot;, whatever that meant in th 70&#39;s.) <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Illich thinks some tools are inherently better than others. And I<br/>
think he&#39;s onto something. He&#39;s a pretty clever guy in general. Anyone<br/>
care to discuss this further?<br/>

&lt;&lt; Well, Zoom is not TV, right? I think it&#39;s way easier to make a game like<br/>
Zoom than to become a major TV broadcaster. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Zoom doesn&#39;t exist without television.<br/>
It&#39;s not a game.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;he mentions TV and<br/>
&quot;computer networks&quot;, whatever that meant in th 70&#39;s.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
TV was quite different in the 70&#39;s, too.<br/>
<br/>
And TV is different as an adjunct to a school life than it is as one of many <br/>
resources for unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Anyway, Illich thinks some tools are inherently better than others. And I<br/>
think he&#39;s onto something. He&#39;s a pretty clever guy in general. Anyone<br/>
care to discuss this further?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Is there a website or discussion group those who are interested can go to?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1758723265">Our earring story:<br/>
I had said the &quot;wait til 13&quot; because that was what was done to me.  <br/>
I didn&#39;t mind waiting as a kid.  Just accepted it.(It&#39;s wierd, what <br/>
an accepting, non questioning child I was).<br/>
My dd seemed to accept it too(which isn&#39;t the norm for her).<br/>
I told her about 4 years ago, that I was wrong, they were her ears, <br/>
and whenever she was ready, we&#39;d go get it done. <br/>
This was not met with happiness!  <br/>
She suffered and anguished about wheather she should or not.  Would <br/>
it &quot;change&quot; her forever.  What if she didn&#39;t like it.  Her perfect <br/>
little ears would be scarred! Not to mention the pain!<br/>
Well, this past birthday(her 11th), she bit the bullet, and we went <br/>
and had it done.  The lady messed up on the first one, and only got <br/>
it half way through.  But, she finally got it done, and Carly handled <br/>
it beautifully.  <br/>
*I* on the other hand, was a blubbering mess!  I held it pretty much <br/>
together, until we got in the parking lot, where I hugged her and <br/>
broke down into a laughing emotional cry.  &quot;My baby!<br/>
Changed forever!&quot;<br/>
We still laugh about that.<br/>
Joanna(who is not the emotional type, and was extremely suprised by <br/>
her behavior that day) <br/>

&gt; Holly got her ears pierced when she was seven.  It was just before <br/>
her 8th <br/>
&gt; birthday.  We went to the mall.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Her dad didn&#39;t want her to, but said it was her choice.  She <br/>
thought about it <br/>
&gt; for a long time, and talked to him another couple of times and he <br/>
said he <br/>
&gt; thought it was a bad idea, but they were her ears.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So she did.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She&#39;s sensitive to stuff, and even the fancy earrings bother her <br/>
ears.  So <br/>
&gt; she let them heal up. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then she decided she wanted them pierced again, about a year <br/>
later.  A friend <br/>
&gt; had some hypodermics of local anesthetic (like paramedics have?) <br/>
and was <br/>
&gt; going to give her a shot there, to be able to gently re-pierce <br/>
through the <br/>
&gt; same hole (so she wouldn&#39;t have a messy big hole, or whatever--we <br/>
didn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; trust the mall piercers to care).  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He ended up using the needle to make the hole.  She took really <br/>
good care of <br/>
&gt; them for a while, but even with using the stuff often, they&#39;d <br/>
ooze.   So now <br/>
&gt; she puts earrings in occasionally, to keep the holes open, and to <br/>
see if as <br/>
&gt; she gets older the problem is less.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I can pick earrings up off the ground and stick them in, nothing <br/>
bothers my <br/>
&gt; ears, except I just don&#39;t much like earrings because they get in my <br/>
way and <br/>
&gt; tangled up in my hair (which is just straight and long).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If we had made her wait, I think she would have put lots of energy <br/>
into <br/>
&gt; thinking about it, being impatient, glorifying it, and maybe then <br/>
being <br/>
&gt; really disappointed by infections.  She&#39;s ten, and it&#39;s not a big <br/>
deal for <br/>
&gt; her one way or another.<br/>

just MHO...<br/>
<br/>
The homeschooled teens I&#39;m friends with seem to just hang out more than<br/>
formally date, and the one kid who kept trying to impress everyone with<br/>
his slick moves and swearing was told pretty clearly that that wouldn&#39;t<br/>
fly... his family struggles a lot with the school stuff, his mom seems to<br/>
want him to be self-motivated to do all sorts of &quot;cool&quot; projects, and he<br/>
wants to IM people and skateboard... he is a nice kid, he used to babysit<br/>
Cacie, but he&#39;s struggling.<br/>
<br/>
I remember lots of nights with rows of kids in their sleeping bags, boys<br/>
and girls... one night when Cacie was 7 or 8 she was sleeping in the<br/>
middle of 4 or 5 teenage boys, after they&#39;d all spent the evening<br/>
inventing lego & rubber band guns than really worked. It was really<br/>
sweet...<br/>
