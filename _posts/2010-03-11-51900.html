<div id="ygrps-yiv-1818425574">I haven&#39;t had a welcome letter, because for the first few years people  <br/>
only came to this list from others, or from my page, so I figured they  <br/>
had some idea what they were getting into.<br/>
<br/>
Does this have enough without having too much?<br/>
<br/>
=======================<br/>
<br/>
This list is special, and a little different.<br/>
<br/>
AlwaysLearning is huge and busy.  Please don&#39;t post an introduction by  <br/>
itself.  When you come to the point that you feel confident in  <br/>
contributing to the exchange, you can add an introduction in there if  <br/>
you want to.  Good ideas are better for the list than introductions are.<br/>
<br/>
Unless they&#39;re mixed in with a great question, a thoughtful response  <br/>
or a story, do not post &quot;thanks&quot;  &quot;me too!&quot;  &quot;LOL&quot; (or any variations  <br/>
thereon)<br/>
<br/>
CAREFULLY proofread your posts. Quote only what&#39;s necessary for yours  <br/>
to make sense, and mark other people&#39;s words physically with **stars**  <br/>
or -=-hyphens-=- or something, because indentations and colors and  <br/>
pointy-brackets disappear.<br/>
<br/>
NEW TO UNSCHOOLING?  A note from Beth Danicke:<br/>
<br/>
I understand that unschooling can be scary and unfamiliar for those  <br/>
who are new to it.  I well remember joining the Unschooling Discussion  <br/>
list 10+ years ago and feeling like I had stumbled into some alternate  <br/>
universe.  Everything seemed upside down because of the way I&#39;d been  <br/>
raised and schooled and what I&#39;d been taught to believe.  Deschooling  <br/>
takes time.<br/>
<br/>
Step back and read and absorb and get familiar with this new thing and  <br/>
WHY it works as opposed to jumping in and challenging ideas and  <br/>
butting heads with people who already KNOW why it works and are  <br/>
willing to share the secret with you.<br/>
<br/>
  It can be frustrating to have people come in with negative attitudes  <br/>
(and<br/>
  many of them seem to think that we&#39;ve never heard their particular  <br/>
&quot;why this<br/>
  won&#39;t work&quot; ideas before) telling us we are wrong and that they know a<br/>
  better way…  (by Beth Danicke, one of the list members)<br/>
<br/>

  That might take you half an hour, but it&#39;s a good investment.  Those  <br/>
who post inappropriately take hundreds of man-hours from the  <br/>
collective lives of the 2000+ members of the list.<br/>

because I think new people coming on to the list will most likely  <br/>
skim that letter.<br/>

I save it in a place that I can get to it easily, and every time I  <br/>
draft a response here (which many, many stay in my draft folder, like  <br/>
Robin), I go over it and check my draft against it.  (Admittedly,  <br/>
I&#39;ve fudged a little, and have regretted hitting the send button  <br/>
every time that niggling feeling of not fulfilling the criteria.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1649856233">Jill!  I forgot about writing that.<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;ll put that as a monthly reminder for everyone, and when it  <br/>
comes out to the list I can put up the stats of the past month to go  <br/>
with it, maybe.  (If I don&#39;t, I hope someone else will).<br/>
<br/>
And the other (when it&#39;s polished) can go to new members as they join.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1675177506">Second draft, with ideas from the list and e-mail.  I&#39;ve incorporated  <br/>
the Joyce-explanation, and mentioned that the list is huge and people  <br/>
don&#39;t have to post.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This list is special, and a little different.  It&#39;s a huge discussion  <br/>
list, and not a little support group.  We&#39;ll discuss the ideas  <br/>
themselves that people bring.  Joyce Fetteroll, one of the moderators,  <br/>
described it this way:<br/>
<br/>
The list is about ideas, not about people.<br/>
<br/>
Think of ideas like balls and the list like a ball court. If someone  <br/>
tosses an idea worth discussing into the court it&#39;s going to get  <br/>
batted about. At that point what&#39;s going on is no longer about the  <br/>
person who tossed the idea in. It&#39;s about the idea and how well and  <br/>
cleanly it&#39;s being tossed about. (Unless the tosser keeps jumping in  <br/>
and grabbing the idea ball saying &quot;Mine!&quot;)  --Joyce<br/>

<br/>
No one is required to post anything.  If you DO want to write,  <br/>
consider all this:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1983588701">I think the ball analogy is apt.  When a poster confuses rejection of their<br/>
idea with &quot;dislike&quot; for themselves--they get mired in &quot;evaluation&quot;(like in<br/>
school).  They think they are getting an &quot;f&quot;, rather than seeing a chance to<br/>
grow or acquire new ideas!<br/>
<br/>
People don&#39;t know the poster personally, but many posters seem to be anxious<br/>
to please and make friends.  This can happen on the list or even or<br/>
facebook, but the list isn&#39;t a social network.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-819242109">That seems like a nice concise intro!  I liked what Beth wrote, it mirrors my experience when I first found the unschooling dot com boards!  Although, there were areas there where you could go and butt heads with folks if you felt like it!  I generally spent more time elsewhere there.<br/>
<br/>
If it keeps people from writing long mean diatribes to others on the side, then I&#39;m all for it!  Thanks for being a buffer Sandra, and for taking so many blows and blocking them so gracefully!<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s rough, but I can&#39;t fix it.  We could pretend to be friends, but  <br/>
that sounds like a horrible waste of time to me, to have a whole bunch  <br/>
of imaginary friends. On the other hand, I have REAL friends and good  <br/>
friends I&#39;ve gained from this online unschooling stuff, but we become  <br/>
friends because of mutual regard for having helped people, or from  <br/>
having kids who are friends, or meeting in person.<br/>
<br/>
Once I said &quot;I&#39;m not here to make friends,&quot; and someone OH so  <br/>
unhelpfully said &quot;GOOD, because you&#39;re not making any.&quot;<br/>
Right.  That&#39;s what I just said.  I&#39;m here to discuss unschooling so  <br/>
that those who want to learn it can.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a phrase I came up with years ago (embarrassing number of long  <br/>
years ago) for a particular purpose in the SCA.  There&#39;s a thing,  <br/>
cousin of knighthood, called The Order of the Pelican.  I was a member  <br/>
(still am, but...) and there was a lot of pressure for us to take  <br/>
students, proteges.  I didn&#39;t want to.  I wanted to be available to  <br/>
just anyone who wanted to learn, rather than taking a student or three  <br/>
and not being available generally.  There was a year or two&#39;s worth of  <br/>
discussion, but the oath part of the ceremony was changed as a  <br/>
compromise, in our part of the SCA (Atenveldt and then Outlands) to  <br/>
say that the person promised to help &quot;all those with an earnest desire  <br/>
to learn.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It didn&#39;t make them responsible to teach people who were just hanging  <br/>
around.  It prevented someone from teaching *only* his own students  <br/>
and nobody else.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that is stuck in the back of my mind, that &quot;earnest desire to  <br/>
learn&quot; concept, and so I&#39;m willing to be really patient with people  <br/>
who do seem to want to know, and pretty IMpatient with people who come  <br/>
around with an arrogant, hostile or dishonest stance.<br/>

trips people up but the intent of the list.<br/>
<br/>
And I think social network is a concept closer to what people are  <br/>
looking for than support group. While ultimately people do seek  <br/>
support (sometimes without realizing it), I think what the ones who  <br/>
end up getting upset are initially looking for is connection. How about:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Always Learning is not a social network but a list to discuss what  <br/>
helps and hinders unschooling. The list exists to deepen  <br/>
understanding of unschooling [or natural learning?].&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(Is it &quot;always learning&quot; as in throughout life or as in every waking  <br/>
moment? Is it just about unschooling kids or about natural learning  <br/>
in general?)<br/>
