<div id="ygrps-yiv-162860437">Ah... yes... ok Sandra. Thanks for clarifying.<br/>
<br/>
I want to work towards a balance between &#39;kid needs&#39; and &#39;mom needs&#39;.  fyi:<br/>
With kids who are still young.... mine are 2.5 and 5.5.<br/>
<br/>
Since my days are too full to find enough comp time to pursue a good<br/>
discussion online.... i thought i&#39;d ask for links to past threads, similar<br/>
topic essays etc.  Not really quotes. This way i can print out and read at<br/>
leisure :-)<br/>
<br/>
Now i understand the confusion i created by pasting that part of Joyce&#39;s<br/>
site.  The link i was referring to:<br/>

*right now* your mom needs aren&#39;t going to get met as much as you  <br/>
might like.<br/>
<br/>
It seems like a little thing, but mental shifts can actually be a  <br/>
huge thing. Fighting against the idea that little kids are needy of  <br/>
mom, only adds more frustration. When we accept that &quot;This is where I  <br/>
am *for now*,&quot; it makes the process of finding solutions a lot  <br/>
easier. When we hold onto expectations that aren&#39;t likely to be met,  <br/>
it just adds to the burden.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t *expect* your needs to get met now while your kids are  <br/>
young, then when your needs are met it feels like a bonus :-)<br/>
<br/>
Kids *do* grow up. Their needs next week, next year, in five years  <br/>
won&#39;t be the same as they are right now.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it rains. Getting angry about the rain, getting angry that  <br/>
it isn&#39;t sunny just adds more misery. This is obvious *and yet* it&#39;s  <br/>
so easy to fall into the trap of negative thinking. Somehow it feels  <br/>
satisfying to release the anger and let the universe know we&#39;re  <br/>
angry. But it doesn&#39;t help. In the moment it might feel like a pot  <br/>
letting off steam, but in the long run it&#39;s really just adding steam  <br/>
to an already steamy room. It&#39;s good to work at letting go of the  <br/>
frustration at what we can&#39;t change to help us help ourselves, so we  <br/>
aren&#39;t getting in the way of our own happiness.<br/>
<br/>
And what helps even more than letting go of the frustration and anger  <br/>
is seeking out the good and the parts you love about right now. And  <br/>
when your thoughts start heading down a negative path, refocus on the  <br/>
good. Look at the delighted smiles on their faces. See the world  <br/>
through their eyes. Look at their tiny fingers. Find ways to be  <br/>
delighted. That will help you not need as much away from them for  <br/>
this time period when they need you.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s nothing you can do. Can you find someone  <br/>
who can take them for a regular period each week? Can you get up a  <br/>
little earlier and have some alone time?<br/>
<br/>
Do you have specific needs? Maybe someone has some ideas. I know the  <br/>
cultures a bit different, but you never know. And something someone  <br/>
says might help you see things in a new way and help you see a  <br/>
solution that would work for you. So, maybe don&#39;t look directly at  <br/>
their solutions, but try to see how they&#39;re maybe seeing the problem  <br/>
from a different angle than you are.<br/>

When mine were that little, we had a neighbor who was 12.  Her family  <br/>
was a Christian homeschooling family and she had two little sisters  <br/>
and a curriculum and a ton of housework.  She was truly thrilled at  <br/>
my offer of $3 an hour to come and be a mother&#39;s helper.  I met her  <br/>
when we came home from the hospital with Holly.  They had just moved  <br/>
to the neighborhood, and she followed us in to ask if she could look  <br/>
at the baby.<br/>
<br/>
Her name was Amy, and she was a part of our lives until her parents  <br/>
divorced and the family was scattered.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could try out a few possible mothers&#39; helpers in exchange  <br/>
for cash or art lessons or something, and if you find a good one that  <br/>
your kids come to love and trust, you&#39;re golden!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1374258824">Grand idea Sandra...<br/>
We have had a similar solution pan out :-)  A young girl called Roopa has<br/>
become a part of the family almost... kids seem to like her.... mostly Z<br/>
likes to play one-on-one with her.  So i get some time with Raghu alone...<br/>
usually able to give him 100% then. Has led to some great ideas and<br/>
projects.<br/>
<br/>
Also had a funny law of attraction moment... dh was able to take friday off<br/>
and m-i-l came to stay a couple of days... and voila... i had some time to<br/>
myself... and the kids were thrilled.<br/>
<br/>
So i&#39;m golden for now... enough energy stashed away for those rainy days.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-346657002">Hello Joyce,<br/>
Love your website... I send the link to anyone who asks &quot;unschooling? what<br/>
is it you do with the kids all day?&quot;  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Have written below:<br/>
------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
*The first and most obvious thing is working towards acceptance that<br/>
*right now* your mom needs aren&#39;t going to get met as much as you<br/>
might like.*<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------<br/>
True.... &quot;right now&quot; just overwhelms me sometimes and the lack of outside<br/>
input... no friends really, lack of resources... libraries etc... tend to<br/>
color my views and make my day seem longer than it is.  But acceptance of it<br/>
all, as it is, is important.<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
*It seems like a little thing, but mental shifts can actually be a<br/>
huge thing. Fighting against the idea that little kids are needy of<br/>
mom, only adds more frustration. When we accept that &quot;This is where I<br/>
am *for now*,&quot; it makes the process of finding solutions a lot<br/>
easier. When we hold onto expectations that aren&#39;t likely to be met,<br/>
it just adds to the burden.*<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
I could not agree more.  thanks for reminding me of this.<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
*If you don&#39;t *expect* your needs to get met now while your kids are<br/>
young, then when your needs are met it feels like a bonus :-)<br/>
<br/>
Kids *do* grow up. Their needs next week, next year, in five years<br/>
won&#39;t be the same as they are right now.<br/>
*<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
True.  And there are lovely growing-up moments all the time... that make me<br/>
aware of the fleeting nature of it all.<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
*Sometimes it rains. Getting angry about the rain, getting angry that<br/>
it isn&#39;t sunny just adds more misery. This is obvious *and yet* it&#39;s<br/>
so easy to fall into the trap of negative thinking. Somehow it feels<br/>

aren&#39;t getting in the way of our own happiness.*<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Funny...i say this to my 5.5 yr old... when he complains about the heat..<br/>
and then i help channel his energy elsewhere.  Well, I should use some of<br/>
this myself :-)<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
*And what helps even more than letting go of the frustration and anger<br/>
is seeking out the good and the parts you love about right now. And<br/>

who can take them for a regular period each week? Can you get up a<br/>
little earlier and have some alone time?*<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Like i posted a few min ago... have found a young girl to play with my 2.5<br/>
year old... who seems to really like her.  so feeling more golden than i<br/>
have in ages.  And the waking up earlier has been happening... just that<br/>
once i&#39;m up... the 5.5 yr old tends to wake up.... and loves early morning<br/>
reading and attention.  rare for him to be in bed no matter how late he<br/>
sleeps... if the sun is up, so is he :-O<br/>
<br/>
But i get your drift.. ... and shall focus on the moment&#39;s delight and not<br/>
the rain. Don&#39;t like myself for wanting time away from them... makes me feel<br/>
like i&#39;m failing them.  Besides due to Dh not being around... he plays catch<br/>
up every w&#39;end... and the kids prefer me to be around even when dh is<br/>
available.  helps smooth out the various areas that were not radically<br/>
unschooled before... and now are.  and dh is still only beginning to get it<br/>
:-)<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
*Do you have specific needs? Maybe someone has some ideas. I know the<br/>
cultures a bit different, but you never know. And something someone<br/>
says might help you see things in a new way and help you see a<br/>
solution that would work for you. So, maybe don&#39;t look directly at<br/>
their solutions, but try to see how they&#39;re maybe seeing the problem<br/>
from a different angle than you are.*<br/>
<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
this is a good point.  I shall have to write when i have time and compelte<br/>
concentration.  My lack of concentration due to the ages of the kids and<br/>
their needs.... makes me wary of starting a thread online.  Mostly... need a<br/>
few more months here before the kids agree to move about a bit by<br/>
themselves... or have friends whom they can play with without me around<br/>
etc..  At present i have to be in the same room mostly.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you Joyce!!<br/>
