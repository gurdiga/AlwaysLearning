<div id="ygrps-yiv-523286399">*How do you meet the needs of 2 or more children when they want different<br/>
and often conflicting things? * For example, today dd (4) wanted me to sit<br/>
and watch a movie with her.  DD (7) wanted me to make her some lunch.  I did<br/>
end up doing both, but narrowly avoided a meltdown by dd (4) because her<br/>
attention was mainly with the movie.  The meltdown came a few minutes later<br/>
when I brought the girls lunch.  Apparently dd (4) didn&#39;t want mac and<br/>
cheese.  In fact, she wasn&#39;t hungry.  She was thirsty.  I had brought her<br/>
water, but she wanted sprite.  I felt that I handled that decently though.<br/>
I just turned around, went back to the kitchen, put the mac & cheese on the<br/>
counter and got the sprite.  I do think that I could have done it with more<br/>
love though.<br/>
<br/>
What do you all do to meet the needs of both or all children when many of<br/>
times things are conflicting?<br/>

Since we can&#39;t know what knowledge will be most needed in the future, it is<br/>
senseless to try to teach it in advance. Instead, we should try to turn out<br/>
people who love learning so much and learn so well that they will be able to<br/>
learn whatever needs to be learned<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I remember for a long time it looked and felt kinda messy in my house on<br/>
this front. Because of your children&#39;s ages, they probably aren&#39;t going to<br/>
be all that patient waiting for anything, even if it&#39;s for a good reason<br/>
(like you are helping someone else). But if you keep your response pleasant<br/>
and loving, and do seek to support them while they are waiting (&quot;I know<br/>
you&#39;re waiting for that...I&#39;ll have it to you in____[fill in the blank for<br/>
how much time it will take]), over time they&#39;ll &quot;get it&quot; that you are a<br/>
great ally for them, that you do all that you can for them, and they are<br/>
MUCH more likely (in fact, pretty surely) to do for you and each other in<br/>
the same kind way. And to be thankful (something that is probably in the<br/>
beginning stages right now for them).<br/>
<br/>
My kids are 18, 17, 15, and 13 and are quite patient and thankful for<br/>
anything I do for them now. They are each very different from the other, so<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s genetic :o)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;and often conflicting things? *&lt;&lt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Somebody once advised me to be lovingly &quot;there&quot; in the little <br/>
workaday moments of feeding, changing diapers, brushing hair and <br/>
teeth, tying shoes, because sometimes it seems like that&#39;s all there <br/>
is when they&#39;re little.  If they&#39;re feeling nurtured and you&#39;re <br/>
taking pleasure in those moments,  everyone&#39;s bucket will be a little <br/>
more full and it will make it a little easier to deal with those <br/>
times when needs are different and there&#39;s conflict.  Not necessarily <br/>
easy, but it helps not to have to deal with those conflicts when <br/>
someone&#39;s running on empty - you or the kids.<br/>
