This is exciting to me.  We have a cheapish Adobe Photoshop subset of  <br/>
stuff called Photoshop Elements 2.0<br/>
There are probably newer versions of that.  I think I paid $90 when  <br/>
it was barely obsolete.  But Holly and Marty have learned to do some  <br/>
very cool things with it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-470136043">Holly&#39;s composite photo is great! My 13-year-old daughter is becoming<br/>
very interested in photography. We have a good Nikon, and we do not<br/>
have a digital camera, but we need one. Dd&#39;s photographic spurts<br/>
require immediate results, which means she&#39;s been using disposable<br/>
cameras with one-hour processing from CVS.<br/>
<br/>
Any tips on where to get a used digital camera, other than e-Bay,<br/>
which we are persuing, would be appreciated. You can email me off-list.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Susan<br/>
Again, great picture, Holly!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-568300823">Cool!<br/>
<br/>
I forwarded the link to my daughter, who enjoys seeing what creative <br/>
stuff other kids are up to.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a (sort of cool/weird) photo she did recently (new since I <br/>
posted her page, I think).<br/>
