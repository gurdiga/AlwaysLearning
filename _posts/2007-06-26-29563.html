<div id="ygrps-yiv-778070003">Hey all,<br/>
I pulled this post from another group list. I have checked it out and<br/>
printed off a list of the movies showing.  It will definitely work for<br/>
bored little ones!!!<br/>
<br/>
Regal theaters are doing this for the summer! Free &quot;G&quot; and &quot;PG&quot; rated<br/>
movies. The film times are shown at 10 am on Tuesday and Wednesdays.<br/>
Admission to all is FREE. Seating are on a first come first serve<br/>
basis. To find a location near you, visit www.regmovies.com. The link<br/>
for the Reg Family Film Festival is on the left hand side, then select<br/>
your state to find one near you. Movies vary from location to location.<br/>
<br/>
HAPPY HUNTING,<br/>
Karen</div>
