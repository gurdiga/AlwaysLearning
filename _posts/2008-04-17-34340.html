<div id="ygrps-yiv-1908752373">We have been unschooling for about a year and a half now (my son is <br/>
11), and I have been searching for a good homeschool support group. A <br/>
physical group--not an online group. Everytime we visit one I come away <br/>
feeling like it wasn&#39;t the right fit for us. Sometimes he meets someone <br/>
he really wants to get together with again, but I find that the parents <br/>
aren&#39;t someone we&#39;d want him to spend time with.  <br/>
<br/>
So I guess my questions are, How important is your face-to-face <br/>
homeschool support system? Do you or your children really benefit from <br/>
park days and pot lucks? What if your child likes it, but you find the <br/>
other parents are a lot different from you?<br/>
<br/>
Online support has been very beneficial to me--where have you found <br/>
support?</div>

the homeschoolers are FAR more relaxed than they were in South Dakota,<br/>
they&#39;re still too restrictive and disrespectful to their children for my<br/>
comfort. Even in the group of local &quot;unschoolers&quot; there&#39;s still an air of<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m the grownup, that&#39;s why!&quot; that makes my hieny tingle (and not in a good<br/>
way!).<br/>
We look now to the entire community as sources of support, inspiration and<br/>
information -- as humans, not as unschoolers. Hayden (9.5) has made friends<br/>
all over the place, there&#39;s no ageism in him and he&#39;s inspired adults to<br/>
cast away their thoughts of ageism where he&#39;s concerned. They&#39;re friends,<br/>
not adult friends, straight-up friends.<br/>

community and see who I&#39;d like to start a real friendship with :D Hayden&#39;s<br/>
attended a couple of events with the same result -- he doesn&#39;t much like the<br/>
*whole* community thing (there seems to be unspoken pressure to attend and<br/>
contribute), he likes that he&#39;s met a couple of boys he&#39;d like to have over<br/>
to hang out. The parents, on the other hand, would like H to hang out with<br/>
their sons on the scheduled group days, avoiding &quot;another&quot; trip into town to<br/>
play. It&#39;s a quandary Hayden&#39;s happy to avoid - he&#39;d rather hang out alone<br/>
at home than go to gym day to see his friends. (Physically alone, most often<br/>
he&#39;s on Skype &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://skype.com">http://skype.com</a>&gt; with friends from all over the map--most of<br/>
whom he knows from unschooling conferences--see below)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>**The first time I found a REAL unschooling support system was my first<br/>
excursion to a Live and Learn Conference &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://liveandlearnconference.org">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a>&gt;.<br/>
There I was able to put faces and three-dimensional perspective to the words<br/>
I&#39;d read on-line. Though I didn&#39;t meet a soul from my hometown, I made<br/>
friends I&#39;ll have for the rest of my life! One family my kids and I really<br/>
connected with lived a handful of hours from our hometown. We made a point<br/>
to get together as often as we could afford -- now that I&#39;ve moved across<br/>
the country, we&#39;re working on moving them here, too :D It was an amazing<br/>
thing to SEE my mentors with their kids, to FEEL the love and respect<br/>
between them... there&#39;s really nothing like it in the world!<br/>
From the Live and Learn model, there are two regional unschooling<br/>
conferences available (Life is Good &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://lifeisgoodconference.com">http://lifeisgoodconference.com</a>&gt; & NE<br/>
Unschoolers &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.northeastunschoolingconference.com/index.html">http://www.northeastunschoolingconference.com/index.html</a>&gt;), and<br/>
many more to come as Live and Learn will be ending after this year.<br/>
We&#39;ve also created gatherings we like to call *non-cons* (as in, not a<br/>
conference) where friends gather in a city and hang out for a few or many<br/>
days, enjoying, inspiring, playing together. (We&#39;ve been blessed with Marty<br/>
Dodd&#39;s presence at a few of them, not only is he the first unschooler my son<br/>
made friends with, they&#39;re honorary brothers to one another -- an amazing<br/>
gift -- I cannot gush enough about him ::bg::)<br/>
I love my lists :) Short of winning the lottery, buying the entire state of<br/>
Kansas and creating my own Utopian Unschooling Society, there&#39;s nothing to<br/>
replace the gifts I&#39;ve found online :D<br/>
It&#39;s not the same, I know... letting go of what it *should be like* has<br/>
really benefited my life (in 12 million ways!), what it *really is* ain&#39;t so<br/>
bad.<br/>
