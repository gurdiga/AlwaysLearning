the breed&#39;s best interest at heart will do their best to eradicate these <br/>

Puppy mills and backyard breeders and pet shops do the most damage to <br/>
purebred animals: stay away from THEM. A reputable breeder&#39;s responsibility <br/>
is to breed sound animals, mentally and physically so that you may have a <br/>
healthy, beautiful family member for many years. And they are there for the <br/>
LIFE of that puppy.<br/>
<br/>
Rescue is a wonderful option, but it does not guarantee a healthy pet either. <br/>
Nor does it guarantee that that pup doesn&#39;t come with &quot;baggage&quot;. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>NO. Rats MUST have at least one other rat to remain mentally healthy. A rat <br/>
that is kept alone will become neurotic. No reputable breeders will sell you <br/>
a single rat. (A pet shop will though! And some will also tell you that it&#39;ll <br/>
be used for snake food if you don&#39;t make a pet out of it!) <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve found that the snakefood rats tend to be a bit smellier than the fancy <br/>
rats from breeders. (Selective breeding again! &lt;g&gt;) They&#39;re also not well <br/>
socialized  (those &quot;breeders&quot; again!) and may bite more readily. <br/>
<br/>
And how big of a space is necessary?<br/>
<br/>
Pretty big, compared to hamsters. My two (a lavender Irish and a champagne <br/>
rex) share a 3&#39;x18&quot;x 3.5&#39; condo. They don&#39;t do well in a fish tank unless <br/>
it&#39;s huge, and they like to climb and sleep in hammocks. <br/>
<br/>
Also, can you keep the stink down? I remember my friend that owned a <br/>
rat...her room always smelled funny!!<br/>
<br/>
Change the cage often. You should never use shavings either--they suffer from <br/>
respiratory ailments. Get recycled newspaper (Carefresh? I forget the name.) <br/>
And buy from a breeder!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Our breeder suggested our blue rex&#39;s fatal respiratory problems might have<br/>
been caused by Carefresh; although it is environmentally nice, being made of<br/>
recycled paper, they use concrete as some part of its ingredients.  I posted<br/>
elsewhere that we use aspen shavings with great success; in fact, the<br/>
cinnamon blue we still have has no more symptoms since we switched.  Aspen<br/>
shavings used to be hard to find, but Petsmart is carrying it now.<br/>

(People must think we&#39;re nuts, buying rats from breeders... &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1310793940">Very nicely said about deaf dogs, Kelly.  You know what you&#39;re talking<br/>
about!  And I should say that I&#39;ve only had a single rat when our oldest<br/>
rat was our only one left, and my daughter lavished attention on her.  I<br/>
was reluctant to say someone should never get just one, because I&#39;m<br/>
always the one advocating hyper responsible dog practices, but you are<br/>
probably right in just saying rats should go in 2&#39;s.<br/>
