&lt;&lt; And I assured my husband that we would never, as long as I<br/>
 am breathing, ever have corn fields.  They&#39;re just creepy!!!  Even without<br/>
 aliens in them!!! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And I always found corn fields sorta magical!!<br/>
I love the swishy sounds when the wind blows and walking down a row where the <br/>
plants are quite a bit taller than you is like being a kid again in a magical <br/>
hidey place.<br/>
And about the combines...<br/>
And I have very fond memories of going to the wheat fields on combine day <br/>
with my Grandad, who was a farmer.<br/>
After the truck got really full of wheat, he&#39;d let my aunt and I climb up on <br/>
top of the mound while they finished. The wheat would pour through the spout <br/>
into the truck and we&#39;d hold our hands under it as the wheat spilled over us.<br/>
(and a few crickets and what not!)<br/>
And I loved the taste of the raw wheat, freshly gathered. Nothing like it.<br/>
I don&#39;t suppose many kids get to experience stuff like that now, what with <br/>
everything being so commercialized.<br/>
We got to eat strawberries fresh from the field next to their house, climb <br/>
trees full of cherries, apples and plums and wander her garden (yes, lots of <br/>
rows of corn :)<br/>
picking all sorts of fresh vegetables. We chased the cows and oohed and aahed <br/>
over the babies.  There is a huge amount of acreage behind their house that <br/>
is full of huge trees and mossy beds with streams bubbling through.<br/>
I spent a lot of time hiking and dreaming there.<br/>
They still have a huge vegetable garden and the fruit trees even though they <br/>
don&#39;t farm anymore.  It was such an idyllic place to spend parts of my <br/>
childhood, I still long for those days again and get a wonderful feeling when <br/>
I visit their &quot;farm&quot;.. (somehow we can&#39;t quit calling it the farm after all <br/>
these years)<br/>
<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-671743381">Because they were popular other places, there is now a corn maze in <br/>
Albuquerque every year.  They just plant corn broadcast instead of rows, and <br/>
then when it grows up they chop the maze out of it, and charge people $4 or <br/>
something to go through it.  My kids love it.<br/>
<br/>
What amuses me greatly is this:<br/>
<br/>
In Nebraska or Indiana or Kansas, corn mazes must really be something cool!<br/>
<br/>
In Albuquerque, the corn&#39;s likely to be kinda stunted (we&#39;re having drought <br/>
years) AND even if the corn&#39;s healthy, you can see the mountains!!   So you <br/>
can&#39;t get really turned around, since the Sandias are to the east, and there <br/>
they are.  &lt;bwg&gt;  Maybe kids don&#39;t always think of that.<br/>
<br/>
I can only imagine a really, really lush corn maze on truly flat land with a <br/>
usually-overcast sky so you can&#39;t even tell by shadows where you are.  Must <br/>
be nice!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-336591423">I remember summers when I was about 8-11 growing up in England.  My<br/>
mother used to ship my brother and I off to my Grandma and Grandfather&#39;s<br/>
house in Derbyshire (a very rural part of England at the time) for the<br/>
entire 6 week summer holiday.  The houses were at least 1/2 mile apart<br/>
and there was nothing but fields and farms in the village.  It was one<br/>
of the happiest times of my life as my brother and I spent the time<br/>
riding bikes along all the very windy roads and watching the combine<br/>
harvesters in the fields.  We got to go and stay with cousins who owned<br/>
farms and get up early and help milk cows and feed the chickens.  We ate<br/>
enormous meals in between to keep our strength up.  My grandmother lived<br/>
on about 20 acres and kept pigs, chickens and goats and grew tomatoes in<br/>
her greenhouse.  I remember helping her feed the animals and picking the<br/>
fresh tomatoes.  She also grew runner beans, peas, carrots, potatoes and<br/>
I remember sitting in her kitchen opening peas up while her friends<br/>
visited and talked about things I had no idea what they were talking<br/>
about.  There was an enormous table in the kitchen, bigger than I&#39;ve<br/>
ever seen in America where there was always plenty of food laid out on<br/>
it.  My uncle Joseph worked for one of the farms in the village and he<br/>
would pop in and out all day to eat and have a cup of tea..... yes very<br/>
good memories for a child that was brought up in the city and really<br/>
disliked the city.<br/>

I used to chat with someone who lived in Hawaii.  The directions they use <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1938889849">Sounds like parts of my childhood in the Yorkshire Dales. My grandmother<br/>
used to do relief teaching at the one-room schools and we travelled around<br/>
(like for maternity leave cases). It was great as I loved the farm life.<br/>
Schools were interesting as well. I remember having 15 to 20 kids ages 5 to<br/>
16 all in our class. In one we used to have a fireplace which we argued<br/>
over sitting closest to. That was also the place I remember the farmer<br/>
coming in and saying the dinner would have to be thrown away because they&#39;d<br/>
used water out of the stream (as always) but there was a dead sheep in the<br/>
stream just further up. One kid always used to come to school with 2<br/>
ferrets which he kept in his trousers. His afternoon job was rabbiting for<br/>
farmers. Lots of the kids rode horses to school and we had to cancel<br/>
classes to go and help out with harvesting at various times.<br/>
<br/>
Hey did you ever go to the caves/mines in Derbyshire? I once went there on<br/>
a school trip and remember some kind of blue stone mines. There were cool<br/>
but obviously not very &quot;educational&quot; as I can&#39;t remember the stones which<br/>
is bugging my geologist husband:) Interesting that the dead sheep story<br/>
stands out though!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
They use windward and leeward kinds of terms. I never knew where I was<br/>
going when we lived there and often used to ask things like &quot;would the<br/>
water be on my left or right&quot; so that I could actually get going in the<br/>
right direction at least:)<br/>
<br/>
And for some reason I can not get oriented here in the UAE and am always<br/>
wanting to say go north for this or that. I think it&#39;s because on all the<br/>
separate UAE maps they turn it which makes it seem like saudi is up (thus<br/>
north) when in reality it&#39;s south west. This doesn&#39;t make sense but it&#39;s<br/>
this visual thing I have based on the maps that are produced here (of<br/>
course even the maps are a bit wobbly as the dividing lines between Oman<br/>
and Saudi are still being argued over and so change depending on where you<br/>
buy the map and various islands are claimed by both the UAE and Iran so<br/>
these also change).<br/>
<br/>
I was in a meeting today as we are making historic videos of the UAE and<br/>
they were talking about how this area was mapped out during the 50s.<br/>
Basically a group of British consuls and guides set out with Bedus and rode<br/>
on horseback and camels around the Gulf to identify what areas were under<br/>
which tribes rule. Then they clustered these into tribal areas which<br/>
eventually were organized into the 7 emirates by the current Sheikh Zayed.<br/>
It was all very hit and miss though and there are still nomadic tribes that<br/>
don&#39;t recognize any boundaries or claim residency in one specific country.<br/>
These are pretty wild groups of people who are fascinating to study.<br/>

My mom&#39;s parents never settled in one place until about the time I was born.  <br/>
They had moved every few months or a year through my mom&#39;s childhood, it <br/>
seems, picking cotton or doing some other very menial labor around west Texas <br/>
and SE New Mexico.    <br/>
<br/>
When I was little, though, they had a couple of acres walking distance from <br/>
us.  And even when we moved to New Mexico, I would go and visit.  The last <br/>
visit, I took a boyfriend from India.  That was pretty exotic for him, crazed <br/>
old Texans with a tractor and crawdads  and other bizarre stuff.<br/>
<br/>
The garden always had tomatoes and okra and green beans.  Other things <br/>
varied, but those were constant.  By the swamp cooler where the water leaked, <br/>
there were grapes growing over a kind of veranda/shade made of scrap metal <br/>
and old bedsprings, and that was a shady place to sit.  They had chickens.  <br/>
Every single morning granny made biscuits from scratch, and it seemed only to <br/>
take her about five minutes to go from flour (she already had the baking soda <br/>
and salt in it, in a bin on the counter) to cutting them with an old metal <br/>
orange juice can to having them in the oven.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I thought most people did corn mazes at night? Everyone we know does,<br/>
anyway. Kind of like a haunted house... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s open at night.  I&#39;ll check this year.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-734363073">No I don&#39;t remember ever going to any mines but I do also remember going<br/>
to the Yorkshire Dales and climbing up these big steep hills.  I used to<br/>
think that it was higher than Mount Everest until I learned a bit more<br/>
about hills and mountains.<br/>

Hey did you ever go to the caves/mines in Derbyshire? I once went there<br/>
on a school trip and remember some kind of blue stone mines. There were<br/>
cool but obviously not very &quot;educational&quot; as I can&#39;t remember the stones<br/>
which is bugging my geologist husband:) Interesting that the dead sheep<br/>
story stands out though!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1925871325">We were watching Men In Black II, and in the &quot;television re-enactment&quot; of <br/>
space aliens having come to earth in 1977 (or whenever it was) and their <br/>
meeting with the Men In Black, they had them in front of a corn field, and <br/>
behind the cornfield there were palm trees.<br/>

register and report goofs that haven&#39;t been discovered yet.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t a goof.  <br/>
There was discussion here about scary alien and ghost stuff always being in <br/>
corn fields, and it must be true, because when they set up a cheesy alien <br/>
encounter they put in a corn field! &lt;g&gt;</div>

Might be.  I just thought it was cool cinemagraphically and &quot;folklorically,&quot; <br/>
if aliens needed corn-field.<br/>

call them &quot;corn patches&quot; though &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
