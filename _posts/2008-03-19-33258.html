<div id="ygrps-yiv-967068625">I feel like we have so many things going against us as far as unschooling goes right now. <br/>
   <br/>
  We are financially strapped , have a van that is on its last legs and no money to replace it right now, the only decent homeschool group is 80 miles away, there is no public transportation to get places. <br/>
   <br/>
  On top of he my son has numerous doctor visits the girls are getting drug to and he is having increasing episodes . By episodes I mean screaming for 9 hours straight, hitting and biting himself and others , Im having to pin him down to keep him from attacking his sisters.<br/>
   <br/>
  Over the past several months he has had me so exhausted I feel like I havent been there for my girls. For example yesterday they wanted to make their bunny hutch ( its a gigngerbread house with an easter theme) I sat and helped with getting icing into the bags and such but I just wasnt &quot;there&quot; with them. All i was thinking about was how much i desperatly wanted my son to go to sleep and crash myself. <br/>
   <br/>
  My sons actions have caused extreme stress on the entire family . its not about me worried that they will get behind and not learn x at y time. Its feeling like maybe for my girls school next year may be a richer more interesting and less stressful environment.  <br/>

<br/>
Can you get some help for yourself with your son? I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m not  <br/>
remembering what his issues are.<br/>

For me as a kid going to school was great.  My sister&#39;s three who had  <br/>
the option to stay home saw two go back for sports and socializing,  <br/>
and the one who had liked school the most never go back.<br/>
<br/>
If your girls do want to go back, look at this once in a while, if it  <br/>
seems helpful:<br/>

<br/>
It wouldn&#39;t need to be forever, anyway.  Your son will get older, and  <br/>
more of your time with him might help him, and the girls will be able  <br/>
to use school as they&#39;d like to, to some extent.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a vast difference between the the experience of a child who  <br/>
is in school and hates it and one who has full option not to be  <br/>
there, but has chosen to be there.<br/>

<br/>
How do they feel about it? That would be more of a determining factor<br/>
than anything. I think children are pretty good at understanding when<br/>
one family member needs a lot more than others. My youngest certainly<br/>
needed a LOT more of us for several years and the other children got<br/>
&quot;gypped&quot; in a sense.<br/>
<br/>
They were amazingly adaptable and willing to be more self-sufficient<br/>
so that Jalen could get what he needed. Not that they didn&#39;t have<br/>
frustrations many times....but there is so much learning and<br/>
connections that came through some difficult stuff.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a big &quot;it depends&quot; situation. Do you know what is causing your<br/>
child&#39;s episodes? Do you have someone that can help you out? A family<br/>
willing to let your girls come hang out with them a couple days per week?<br/>

We dont have any family or anyone in the area. He is on a waiting list for us to get help with respite care for a year and a half now. We do save money we really cant afford so that we can get care for him once a month for a few hours so we can go out. I helps keep me sane .<br/>
   <br/>
  He is severly autistic, non verbal , and has mild cerebral palsy. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-920614097">Please don&#39;t take this as harsh, but simply as another option. *Maybe* your <br/>
son is the one who should be going to school, presumeably a special school <br/>
and maybe only part time, rather than your daughters.<br/>
<br/>
It must be hard on them to always be made second to his extreme needs. I can <br/>
hear how torn you feel.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the squeaky wheel gets the grease. Perhaps more calling and <br/>
following up on the respite care request would speed it along.<br/>

  Not taking it as harsh . He is in school . After 2 years of fighting he is actually in school with a great teacher who isnt calling me at 10 am daily to come pick him up because he is throwing a fit. This dosent change the numerous doctor and therapy appointments that i have to pick him up from school for and drag the girls to weekly. These are at best boring and occasionly at worst embarassing when he decides to do something like suddenly pulling down his pants and mooning everyone. <br/>
   <br/>
  Im honestly not trying to ship them off to school to make them second . I feel that school may give them a bit of a break. <br/>

  My 4 year old has announced that she is going to school next year. :) <br/>
   <br/>
  My 8 year old isnt so sure about school ( one day she wants to go another she wants to stay home ) but she has expressed a need for a break. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I second this recommendation. Call your state representatives (if this is a<br/>
State respite program) and share your desperation. The squeaky wheel *will*<br/>
get the grease ;)<br/>
(from experience, I called upon Tom Daschle many many times during trials<br/>
and tribulations with Social Security -- I used to call them first and do<br/>
the &quot;proper&quot; channels, no more! He got immediate results for me. Thankfully<br/>
I&#39;ve had no issues since he left office, though I&#39;ve decided I&#39;ll just call<br/>
him at home if I do ::bg::)<br/>

This may be unnecessary, but I wanted to recommend that you treat the girls individually.  <br/>
You keep talking about them as a unit, so I&#39;m not sure if you think of them that way or if it <br/>
was just more convenient to refer to them that way.  Also, in times of stress, it&#39;s very <br/>
tempting to focus on the solutions and to have an answer--but try to remain as flexible as <br/>
possible.  <br/>
<br/>
If one or both are in school could you keep the door open if its not working?  The break <br/>
may sound good right now and work, or the realities of actually spending all of that time <br/>
away from the family might not be as good as it sounds.  I&#39;m actually thinking of myself <br/>
and &quot;time off.&quot;  I usually end up thinking about my kids and look forward to being back <br/>
home.<br/>
<br/>
When I was growing up I had an older (by 13 years) half brother.  We&#39;ll just say that life <br/>
was not as kind to him as it has been to me.  He did a lot of drugs, joined a cult, etc.  <br/>
When he visited there was usually tons of drama.  As a kid, I just flowed along with it, and <br/>
I don&#39;t think it really disrupted my childhood much. It was just a sad thing--an <br/>
unpleasant feature of the landscape.   I do think that kids are in some ways more resilient <br/>
in the face of adversity that we fear.  That being said, I fiercely protect mine from <br/>
adversity, so go figure.  ;-)<br/>

   <br/>
  This may be more information than you want &lt;g&gt; i helped put an ex in jail for assualt, intent to sale and lost the baby shortly after the assualt. Years later i got pregnant with my oldest and got rumors that he was threatening to hurt her. <br/>
  It would probably be fine to address them by name here but it becomes a habbit to refer to them as the girls and my son or dd8, dd4 and ds. <br/>
  They are very much their own individual people though :)  <br/>
   <br/>
  If one or both are in school could you keep the door open if its not working?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
   <br/>
  The state Im in its quite easy to remove them at any point in the year and I have no plans to force school on my kids if it isnt where they want to be. <br/>
   <br/>

  My oldest has been in school and i looked forward to time to pick her up :) <br/>
   <br/>

I don&#39;t think it really disrupted my childhood much&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
   <br/>
  I think this really depends on the kid. My 8 year old carries the world on her shoulders. i often see her become very stressed and worried over her brother <br/>
