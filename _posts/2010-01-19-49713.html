<div id="ygrps-yiv-1039067906">For the interest in learning to fly, have you looked into the Civil Air Patrol?  They have a teen program as well.  I know a homeschooling Mom locally whose teenage daughter is very involved in CAP.  I&#39;m sure that, as a single Mom, she&#39;s not shelling out $375/hr for flying lessons.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-29940949">Sorry I didn&#39;t mention it in the original post but we are in Australia. He has been a member of Air Cadets but that was through school and so we have let it go. <br/>
<br/>
He does play Microsoft flight simulator quite alot. He has already had about 5 flying lessons and is wanting to continue, but this is where the trouble has arisen.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to you all who have taken the time to consider our problem and especially those who have sent links to air training organisations.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me the path being recommended is to allow him to continue as he is- give him money for excursions with friends, maybe try to find some work experience in a field related to flight and stop thinking about his age?<br/>

<br/>
The more he explores flying (and any other interests) to the extent  <br/>
that you can help him do so and finds this is something he really  <br/>
really wants to do, that will be far greater motivation to him  <br/>
finding a way to pursue it than any nagging or lecturing or telling  <br/>
him will. (Which actually are far better at demotivating someone.)<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s spent 12 years or so working towards a goal (good grades,  <br/>
college) that everyone said was where he needed to go to be  <br/>
successful. And that turned out to be a lie. 12 years. Pretty much  <br/>
his entire childhood. You can&#39;t give him that back *but* you can give  <br/>
him the best now you possibly can. He needs time to recover. He needs  <br/>
time to just be. Rule of thumb is a month of deschooling for each  <br/>
year in school.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/deschooling">http://sandradodd.com/deschooling</a><br/>
<br/>
(And I&#39;d up that since his experience was so negative.) And  <br/>
deschooling isn&#39;t just on his part. You need to not nudge him in a  <br/>
direction you want him to go. Each time you bug him, the clock resets.<br/>
<br/>
As Sandra suggested, treat this as though he were recovering from a  <br/>
serious injury. He is. It&#39;s an injury you can&#39;t see.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So you could pay for flying lessons? Anyway - here is a question. Why do <br/>
you think he&#39;s faking being interested in being a pilot if he&#39;s saying <br/>
he is after having had 5 flying lessons? That&#39;s a lot - that shows a <br/>
pretty serious interest, I&#39;d think.<br/>
<br/>
  If you&#39;ve been able to pay almost $400 each for 5 hours of lessons <br/>
(and not even remember exactly how many) then it sounds like you have <br/>
the money. That&#39;s almost $2,000.   So you ARE supporting that interest - <br/>
and flight simulator is probably the next best thing and he&#39;s doing that <br/>
a lot.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t get the problem or question anymore.<br/>

 <br/>
Considering his age is fine.  Deciding what he should or shouldn&#39;t be like or into at any particular age is where you&#39;re going to run into trouble.   He could stay where he&#39;s at for years and suddenly jump into the larger world.  Or it could be a slow and gradual shift to adulthood.  But for now, he&#39;s a kid who&#39;s dealt with emotional upheaval, give him time and space to recover.<br/>
