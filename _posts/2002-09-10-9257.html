<div id="ygrps-yiv-730602800">So I&#39;m reading Mira Kirshenbaum&#39;s book, &quot;Parent/Teen Breakthrough&quot; where she<br/>
advocates giving up control and developing a relationship approach.  I know I need<br/>
to do this.<br/>
<br/>
I have given up a lot of control already.  Most of the time it has worked, very<br/>
successfully just like everyone told me it would.  From food to makeup to TV and<br/>
computers (and more), there&#39;s a temporary burst of freedom and then a happy<br/>
settling down.<br/>
<br/>
Yet as I read the book, I find myself getting so scared to stop being the one in<br/>
charge.  I even understand I&#39;m not in charge, it&#39;s just an illusion.  I serve at<br/>
the pleasure of my child.  But there&#39;s this fear.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s about the transition, this time period where she may do &quot;crazy&quot;<br/>
things just because she can.  I want her to live through it.  I started to type<br/>
some examples but I guess the point is that they are all safety issues.  I don&#39;t<br/>
want to negotiate safety issues.  I guess I have to but it makes my hands wet just<br/>
thinking about it.<br/>
<br/>
I know a lot of you have kids that were never controlled and didn&#39;t go through<br/>
this transitional time.  Any advice on how to get through it?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s those &#34;crazies&#34; out there in the world<br/>
that scare me!!! And most of the safety issues seem to<br/>
be related to potential encounters with that element.<br/>
If your child knows this, then being prepared (as best<br/>
as can) and being aware, and being in safe<br/>
environments (as best as can) seem more reasonable.  <br/>
For example, having a well maintained vehicle to<br/>
drive, letting those who care know where they are,<br/>
taking the safe, scenic route, letting those who care<br/>
know when there is a change of venue, knowing when<br/>
that little inside voice says &#34;I&#39;m uncomfortable<br/>
with xxxx&#34; that it is time to go home or run or<br/>
dial 911 or whatever is the plan for the emergency.<br/>
Knowing first aid, some self-defense, how to use money<br/>
(and having some to use), get from one place to<br/>
another, and a myriad of other safety issues are not<br/>
controlling.....knowing how to get along in the world<br/>
is not controlling....it allows for freedom becuase<br/>
you and your child know you are as prepared as you can<br/>
be. <br/>
<br/>
Those &#34;bad guy&#39;s&#34; and the other people on the<br/>
roads aren&#39;t your fault or your child&#39;s, but you do<br/>
have to watch out for them. All of the time.<br/>
