<div id="ygrps-yiv-1099464298">I so wish I could go to the conference.  I have been reading here for <br/>
several months and at unschooling.com for about 3 years now.  I very <br/>
rarely post, mostly because it takes me too long to decide what I <br/>
want to say, but I really wish I could meet y&#39;all.<br/>
<br/>
We live in NW Florida right now, actually pretty close to Ren.  We go <br/>
to the Pensacola group sometimes where she is.  However, we will be <br/>
moving to Turkey in about 6 weeks!  I was sure hoping we would be <br/>
here through the summer so we could come to SC.  Waaahh!<br/>
<br/>
If anyone&#39;s interested in hearing about Turkey, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be back <br/>
on this list when we&#39;re there too.  I will be missing our cable modem <br/>
though, among other things.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for a great list,<br/>

More opportunity for learning there than at all the conferences in the world, <br/>
I figure!!<br/>

Don&#39;t feel bad.  YES, write and tell us stories!<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s the reason for the move?  Husband&#39;s job?  Yours?  Military?  <br/>
Missionary?  Relatives?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1074632460">My husband is in the Air Force.  He is already there - left a few <br/>
weeks ago.  We were all supposed to go at the same time, but they <br/>
weren&#39;t letting family members go over there for a while with the war <br/>
and all.  <br/>
<br/>
So, we&#39;ll be living on a military base.  It&#39;s in the southern part of <br/>
Turkey, close to the Mediterranean (the hottest part).  I hope that <br/>
it will be safe enough for us to do some traveling.  The area right <br/>
around the base is very dependant on Americans spending money there, <br/>
so they&#39;ll probably be pretty nice, at least on the surface.  I am <br/>
looking forward getting there, but I&#39;m just not excited about the <br/>
whole moving thing without my husband&#39;s help!  I have 2 daughters - 8 <br/>
& 3 years old.<br/>
