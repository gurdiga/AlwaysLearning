<div id="ygrps-yiv-1716707104">hello,<br/>
a few weeks ago, I wrote asking for advice about protecting  my soon to be 8yo daughter <br/>
shanti from detrimental effects that could be had by annual testing.  I surely must have <br/>
worded my post poorly as I did not get any sort of response, on or off list. So I am trying <br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
First the background, then my issues...<br/>
<br/>
Here in italy, homeschooling is garanteed by the law, as long as the parents have the <br/>
capability both economically and &quot;physically&quot;  (Im not remembering the wording in italian <br/>
but it comes basically to that)...  And according to this same law, testing is not required <br/>
except apon re entry to the public school system,  except for the 8th year (end of 8th <br/>
grade).  All exiting 8thgraders must take a public exam and homeschooled children are <br/>
included...all well and good.  THis information for me was what let me really go free with <br/>
unschooling, because I had no fears for annual testing.  <br/>
<br/>
Then boom, the 15th of april, I get the letter that tells me to prepare a curriculum for april <br/>
30, along with a request for admission to the exam for going into the 3rd grade.  I call the <br/>
principal to clarify, We intend to continue homeschool so as I understand it there is no <br/>
need to take this exam...the principal looks up the information, as it seems possible, but <br/>
no, there is a new &quot;request&quot; ( &quot;circolare&quot;) from the Dept of Education that all <br/>
homeschoolers take an exam which I have come to understand is to see if the child is <br/>
indeed learning...I understand now that there are many children that are being kept home <br/>
to work or worse, so that the daughters do not mix with unwelcome others...Or at least, <br/>
this is the fear, as I have yet to meet in person another homeschooled child. <br/>
<br/>
There are a handful of us, doing it Italian Style (as opposed to expat style--they are <br/>
basically ignored as they are learning in english or foreign languages).<br/>
<br/>
So my fears are many and not all stemming from the exam per se but exasperated by it.<br/>
<br/>
I am afraid she will feel inadequate if she doesnt understand  what is required of her.  I <br/>
already get this feeling that she thinks that she doesnt &quot;do&quot; anything (she is incredibly <br/>
creative and free and wonderful) because her two older brothers help her along this way.  I <br/>
sometimes feel like they (well, mainly my 14yo, the 10yo not so much) are mobbing <br/>
her...not full time, but enough that I am feeling overprotective, maybe...afraid for her self <br/>
esteem...afraid that Pure Unschooling may just not be possible, as I have no chance of <br/>
deschooling my 14 yo?<br/>
<br/>
Im wondering about things that Ive read here and elsewhere where Sandra writes to just <br/>
let the child go into the test &quot;cold&quot;.   <br/>
<br/>
I just recently read this on Unschooling discussion and altho it was referring to a teenager, <br/>
it really resonated as a Truth.  Yet Im scared.<br/>
<br/>
What am I scared of? and can this be possible for a child of almost 8years?  She will be <br/>
facing 3 teachers, whom she does not know, in a strange environment, and they will be <br/>
covering all that they &quot;do &quot; in school.  GRanted, I am not required to follow the school <br/>
curriculum, yet, with basically no materials to show *what* she has done, they have <br/>
nothing to go by to create their test...<br/>
<br/>
I have all sorts of books for &quot;2nd&quot; graders, with worksheets to fill out and such, because <br/>
having had 4 children already go thru the second grade, these things acumalate (we buy <br/>
new books year by year in italy, but that is another issue)...<br/>
So I know what they will be looking for.  I am pretty sure she is fine for just about <br/>
everything except long division and multiplications with carryovers (we havent ever <br/>
touched the stuff on paper, just as it comes up...she can see a bunch of orderly holes and <br/>
count that they are 5 holes by 10 holes and knows instantly they are 50. so I know the <br/>
concepts are there, so I said so, but I dont know if she can *do* them on paper unless I <br/>
show her first...I d really hate for her to have to do multiplication or long division and not <br/>
have the slightest clue.<br/>
<br/>
Help!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>this would be an idea, yet everyone is telling me, &quot;this is Italy.&quot;  Meaning, the law can be <br/>
interpreted in different ways, depending on what sort of judge I get infront of me. <br/>
<br/>
THe main advice here is to have good rapport with your school officials.   last years <br/>
principal was just a lovely person, who helped me find the contacts, encouraged me to <br/>
homeschool, and found the laws himself (he was the person that assured me I wouldnt <br/>
have to test unless re entering the public school system), but this is a very small school in <br/>
a rather rural mountain area, so the principals come and go. Last years had lasted 4 years, <br/>
which was a record.  This year, a new principal arrived and of a different sort.  Last years, <br/>
he knew the term Attachment Parenting (a rarity for italy), he knew about Nonviolent <br/>
Communication...this years left home at 9 to boarding school in the big city 2 hours from <br/>
home and continued on thru University.  (we know these details because dh Lorenzo is <br/>
very good at pulling other peoples stories out of them).  We also learned from this <br/>
conversation that he thinks school is as important as the Pope (not his actual words, but to <br/>
give an idea.).  <br/>
<br/>
One possibility Ive learned last week is that I may choose the school that I wish to &quot;declare <br/>
my homeschooling&quot; with...So Ive been talking with friends, and one knows an elementary <br/>
principal (a woman for a change) who may be sympathetic to our ideas. I am going to meet <br/>
with her next week, but for this year I expect the test to happen.  Next year maybe this <br/>
&quot;regulation&quot; will be dropped. We did just change governments. What I do understand is if <br/>
the principal doesnt want to test, she doesnt have to.  But the guy Im dealing with right <br/>
now, he seems to enjoy fiscality, to the umpteenth.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is  clever! The &quot;regulation&quot; that came before this one (2006) wanted testing to happen <br/>
in first, third and fifth grades but from what I understand, this was never done. the <br/>
families I exchange emails with have never had to do any testing.  And from what I gather, <br/>
the newest &quot;regulation&quot; (because again, they arent Laws, in the true sense) which was sent <br/>
out the end of March 2008, has not reaped any other heads other than my own.  sigh.  <br/>
<br/>
For this year, I am pretty much resigned for the test. And Im hoping to change schools <br/>
with which to deal with.  I was hoping I could do it with a private school,  but regestering <br/>
must be with a public institution...or even the correspondence school you mention, but <br/>
because we are &quot;part&quot; of the italian system already, Ive been told that sort of solution <br/>
wouldnt work.  It is not recognised as a school, and so we would still be homeschooling.  I <br/>
think that the clonlara school works for&lt; both parents foreigners&gt; families. And especially <br/>
for families who dont have other children within the school system.  I cant vanish <br/>
anymore.  At least not this year.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I did contact the director, but she says she doesnt need recognition to exit.  I can <br/>
understand her point of view, but I would have preferred hearing if other families are <br/>
actually able to do school with clonlara for the whole &quot;school required time&quot; here in italy.<br/>
<br/>
I know that the 8th grade exam is not avoidable, tho one can post pone it in the way you <br/>
are suggesting for the elementary exam by saying the child is repeating the year.  But not <br/>
skip it.<br/>
<br/>
Im rather reluctant to use this strategy here, as there is that clause that says &quot;if the parent <br/>
is not able to teach&quot; then he must avail of the public school system, and the clause gives <br/>
the principal the power to decide that I am not capable of teaching.  Obviously I can take <br/>
this to court, but I would rather just slide by this year, at least...<br/>
<br/>

the &quot;circolare&quot;-<br/>
<br/>
dont think dh would go for skipping out tho.  He is more for taking it, and then working to <br/>
avoid it in the future, but if not then taking the bull by the horns.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>well, he conceded that he &quot;could&quot; use only two teachers.  But the circolare specifies 3. I <br/>
dont really get why 3 are needed.  I suggested having the testing happen in our home, <br/>
seeing as this is the environment where she learns.  That was no dice.  He did give me one <br/>
little assurance:  I told him that I was worried because of her negative experiences with <br/>
school the year before.  I explained that we dont use the same methods nor arrive at the <br/>
same goals as might be done within a school context...he asked for a collection of her <br/>
things she has done and they would base the test on that.  So I said okay.<br/>
<br/>
Thing was, Ive got no collection of works.!  just drawings, yarns she has  spun, cloths she <br/>
has woven, a few stories that Ive not even read as she likes to write for herself...and a <br/>
couple pages of workbook stuff here and there.  She has a formidible pile of books she <br/>
has read---hats she has sewn, dollies she has created but not much for basing their <br/>
beloved test upon.  I was not concerned with leaving a trace behind me. Dh warned me, I <br/>
didnt listen. That was a mistake.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Could you ask them not to give you or your daughter the results?  Or  <br/>
&gt; ask for the results sealed and then not open them?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I did ask this in writing.  I dont know the answer yet, however.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; (Just brainstorming possibilities...)<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks for brainstorming.<br/>
<br/>
I like the idea of skipping about. But for this year thats out. Its too late for that...or do you <br/>
think I should try to negotiate it? I dont think dh would go for it.  <br/>
<br/>
My main concern now is definitely trying to &quot;protect her gift&quot; so to speak. *I* have been <br/>
playing math games the last couple of days and she has been joining in.  Today, she <br/>
actually asked to change from one on miniclip to go back to the math games...but Idont <br/>
know if she has been tuning into my concerns. She no dummy. So now what?<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, do you think she might need a little support, even covert support as in &quot;lets help <br/>
mamma do some grammar &quot; (everyone Knows mamma needs italian grammar help), and <br/>
lets play some of those math games again...<br/>
thats basically what italian school is about. Doing math and Doing Grammar. they give lip <br/>
service to the rest.  The rest is where she is strong...she loves to read and write.<br/>
<br/>
This letter is a rather muddle, im afraid.  <br/>
<br/>
Let me see, these are the things I Know:<br/>
<br/>
-They want to know that she is indeed learning.<br/>
-She doesnt *have* to k now what she is &quot;expected&quot; to know.<br/>
-I have every right to homeschool her.<br/>
-I have every right to homeschool using the curriculum and method I prefer.<br/>
<br/>
-I *may* be able to avoid knowing whether she has passed or not. I like the idea of results <br/>
written in a sealed envelope.  I expect that would be just in keeping with the principal&#39;s <br/>
fetish for beurocracy. (Im being sarcastic, sorry. Ive deleted so many but this one is <br/>
staying).<br/>
<br/>
-I asked to be able to see the exam prior to her taking it.  he didnt answer yes but he <br/>
didnt answer no either.  He said &quot;get the curriculum in and then we will see.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
One last note:  this &quot;regulation&quot; is rather strange.  It &quot;admits&quot; (ammettere, which is close to <br/>
permettere or &quot;permits&quot;) me to &quot;ask for&quot; in writing to take the exam of &quot;idoneità&quot; which <br/>
google translates as suitability ...for entering the next grade I guess.<br/>
<br/>
Because *I* am not required to know about these &quot;circolari&quot; or new regulations, if the <br/>
principal hadnt bothered with letting me know, I wouldnt *have* to ask to have the test <br/>
given to Shanti. But because they asked, if I say no, they could cause us trouble. I dont <br/>
know that it could be problematic in the long run but I expect it could be stressful, <br/>
especially for dh.  I mean, everybody knows our family. And although we are not &quot;normal&quot; <br/>
our children are well liked by everybody and my older girls are&quot;academic stars&quot; and have <br/>
received awards etc...(not because of us, but in this sort of situation, I expect this would <br/>
reflect on us).<br/>
<br/>
Part of me wanted to just say no. we dont have to do this, so we wont. but Im not <br/>
garenteed anything. and homeschooling is not exactly popular here yet.<br/>
<br/>
so Im off,<br/>
thanks alot for puting your brain to storm, <br/>
my littlest is stirring.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-314592803">Make it up. Figure out what she knows  - and write it down as if that  <br/>
is what you taught. Don&#39;t turn in stuff of HERS to them, you write up  <br/>
what you&#39;ve supposedly taught - things for them to ask her about.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s only going into 3rd grade? There&#39;s no long division in 2nd grade.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - do you read to her? Does she read? What do you and she read?  <br/>
Write those books down as if those were assigned reading. They can ask  <br/>
her questions about them.<br/>
<br/>
Does she know something about weaving and yarn-making? Write that down  <br/>
- that is a perfectly respectable thing for her to be learning. They  <br/>
can ask her questions about it.<br/>
<br/>
Vocabulary development - provide them with a list of the words she  <br/>
knows already - say you taught them to her. They can test her on their  <br/>
meaning and ask her to use them in a sentence.<br/>
<br/>
For math - write down what she really knows already.<br/>
<br/>
Addition facts? Subtraction facts? Two-digit addition? More than two- <br/>
digits? With carrying? Two-digit subtraction? More than 2 digits? With  <br/>
borrowing? Whatever she does know - write that down.<br/>
<br/>
Measurement -- how to use a meter stick? How many centimeters in a  <br/>
meter?<br/>
<br/>
Money - that&#39;s a good one for this age.<br/>
<br/>
Calendar -- does she know how many days in a week, months in a year,  <br/>
days in a year?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe a little probability? If there are two pink and one blue balls  <br/>
in a bag, what color is most likely to be drawn out of the bag without  <br/>
looking? Why? (Younger kids will say &quot;Pink, because that&#39;s my favorite  <br/>
color,&quot; or &quot;Blue, because I&#39;m a boy and pink is for girls.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Does she know shapes? Triangles, squares, rectangles?<br/>
<br/>
Counting by twos, threes, fives, tens?<br/>
<br/>
Fractions - simple ones like &quot;Divide a pizza into fourths.&quot; Daily life  <br/>
stuff - not math worksheet stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Temperature - does she know how to read a thermometer - air temp, I  <br/>
mean, not body temp.<br/>
<br/>
Concept of ratio? -- &quot;If there are 10 boys and 5 girls, there are 2  <br/>
boys for each 1 girl.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Again - it seems like you are supposed to tell them what to test her  <br/>
on. So look at some typical courses of study and make a list from  <br/>
those of things she knows already.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the World Book Course of Study for Grade 2 --- I&#39;m NOT saying  <br/>
she should know all this, but if you pick things off this that she  <br/>
does know, that&#39;ll give them stuff to test her on.<br/>

Are you Italian yourself?  I&#39;m guessing that your dh is, but not sure  <br/>
about you.  If you are English speaking, could you say that she is  <br/>
studying in English?  You said something about how that group living  <br/>

Pam, thankyou for this nice translation of academics...<br/>
its very reassuring.  <br/>
<br/>
I actually *did* this! my friend that Im relying on for advice told me to take any of the 2nd <br/>
year books we have on hand and look either at the beginning of each chapter or  the table <br/>
of contents (depends which editor) are the actual requirements for curriculum<br/>
<br/>
...so Yes.  She does know lots, and every thing that was written as to be covered, including <br/>
understanding the concept of division with and with out &quot;resto&quot; (leftover??cant remember <br/>
the term).  THey *are* teaching long division in the second grade now and the two newest <br/>
books I have show the process.  They didnt use to.  My first 3 childrens books dont have <br/>
this covered.  Just dividing groups of things up.<br/>
<br/>
I said she understood the concept which is what the official lingo states...the book just <br/>
goes into long division. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
She reads: As I helped her older brother grasp the alphabet she just watched played the <br/>
games and absorbed it along side him.<br/>
<br/>
thanks again, Pam, because your list makes me feel *very* reassured.<br/>
she know all that stuff and more.  She can measure kilos, and double or triple a recipe <br/>
with 180 grams of flour.  She is quite good at multiplying and dividing small amounts (we <br/>
are a family of 9, after all, lots of stuff to pass out all the time!)<br/>
<br/>
She recognises and can read out numbers into the 4digit range (skill from video <br/>
gamescores)<br/>
<br/>
so yes, actually not giving them anything does work to her advantage ...<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, I am feeling this anxiety is *mine* and getting some feed back is helping get <br/>
my thoughts back into perspective.  Like many have told me, they probably arent trying to <br/>
ruin our life...these are teachers and they like kids.<br/>
<br/>
I had mentioned to the principle that she reads quite well...and he actually said &quot;so what <br/>
are you worried about?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I just need to get a grip.  RElax and let her be, I expect.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1117448101">yes, I am a US expat...<br/>
but I dont think it is doable as this is a small community and everybody knows us. THe <br/>
principals change but the schools and their teachers dont!  Even in alba ( the larger city <br/>
where the highschools are located --only about 25.000)our older girls are well know, as <br/>
they are liked and enthusiastic participants at school and in after school activities. <br/>
 <br/>
And shanti the teachers already know her. I used to teach english and music &quot;laboratories&quot; <br/>
in the schools and she always tagged along. Not to mention the fact that she started the <br/>
first grade here, and that just didnt work out. Since I knew that year that I could indeed <br/>
homeschool, I did.  (before that, internet was not useful yet in italy, and I didnt know we <br/>
could)...<br/>
<br/>
I think that the expats are ignored because the children arent italian citizens so they let <br/>
them learn as they please.<br/>
<br/>
its different for our kids, tho of course if we had homeschooled from the beginning, <br/>
maybe we could have slipped thru the loops more easily.<br/>
<br/>
thankyou for responding! Ive been feeling so anxious, its nice to receive support!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-290692745">I think Pam&#39;s advice was right on target. Everything I&#39;ve read in your<br/>
emails here indicates that your daughter is at least at the same level<br/>
of other 2nd graders there, and certainly above them in some areas.<br/>
So yeah, definitely, be reassured! <br/>
<br/>
.  Like many have told me, they probably arent trying to <br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>While relaxing your test anxiety is a great idea, I would definitely<br/>
caution you about making assumptions about the motivations of those in<br/>
the school system, for several reasons. Whatever their personal<br/>
motivations, they *are* part of that system, and obliged to defend it.<br/>
And you are the odd one out, however well liked your family is in the<br/>
area. The fact that your older children are also supporters of that<br/>
system (by their actions and even some of their &quot;not deschooled&quot;<br/>
sentiments, as you described) could even work against you, in a worst<br/>
case scenario.<br/>
<br/>
You know I&#39;m speaking from personal experience here, but I don&#39;t think<br/>
it&#39;s safe to assume that what others think is best for our children<br/>
will actually be what you or the children think is best. Especially<br/>
since homeschooling seems to be even less accepted there than it is in<br/>
France, the teachers will likely have never even thought about<br/>
unschooling at all, much less embraced it as you have. And if push<br/>
comes to shove, they would likely encourage you to put her in school,<br/>
for her own good. BECAUSE they like kids. BECAUSE based on what they<br/>
have internalized, that is what is best for her. And while that<br/>
wouldn&#39;t &quot;ruin her life&quot; in all likelihood, it&#39;s certainly not what<br/>
you would consider best for her, right?<br/>
<br/>
In general, I would suggest that you keep this in mind in your<br/>
dealings with anyone in the system. I don&#39;t think paranoid is the way<br/>
to go into it, but neither do I feel that you can believe that you are<br/>
all partners in looking out for your family&#39;s welfare. Keep that as<br/>
your and your dh&#39;s own personal job, and keep the &quot;well-meaning&quot;<br/>
strangers at arm&#39;s length as much as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Just my own personal two cents! <br/>

Most tests are reading tests, even the math parts.   You can usually  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>hi rebecca, sandra--<br/>
I did this.  Actually, sandra, I translated both versions of that curriculum outline and mixed <br/>
them together.  so it was in a Subject outline format, but describing both the concept (not <br/>
calling it unschooling, but describing the approach) and then our goals as parents for <br/>
supporting our daughter&#39;s learning experience. (tried to keep teaching out of it).<br/>
<br/>
then I made the objectives list (school style)<br/>
<br/>
the materials used I kept within the descriptions --I intended to make the long list but my <br/>
dds told me I was being redundant.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, if you want these, I will send them to you, just it isn&#39;tan &quot;exact copy&quot; of that link, <br/>
its a hybrid as I like her personal version, but I felt the school would prefer the school <br/>
version, so I mixed them together.<br/>
<br/>
like I said, I think this is *my* testing anxiety, more than anything.  Im feeling much <br/>
calmer now. I do have a tendency to hate not knowing what is going to happen next.  <br/>
And not knowing if this is just for this year, or will be a constant is roding my mind, as <br/>
well.  I know there is an element of shantis fear here, but I think If *I* am straight in my <br/>
confidence, she will be too.  She is a very strong character.  but I would not put it passed <br/>
her if she up and refused to take the test, when she got there...lol  I wonder what would <br/>
happen then?<br/>
<br/>
But Ive received alot of ideas here, and at the same time reassurance that it shouldnt be <br/>
too bad. Thanks for that.<br/>
<br/>
I will try talking with the principal this coming week, (this past week was national holiday)<br/>
and see what he thinks...I d like to see the test before hand...maybe mention directly what <br/>
I think about her math capabilities...<br/>
<br/>
ok gotta make breakfast.<br/>

sleeping kiddos-too lazy to look for the earphones) I found it way depressing.  BUt I guess <br/>
that is because dd must take a test. And it is just this aspect that I find so very unnerving.  <br/>
She *knows* so much, she is so wise, and creative and free, yet she will be tested on just a <br/>
bit of knowlege, that is really <br/>
stuff adding to she is supposed to have a handle on for the Big Exam in 8th grade. It is so <br/>
depressing. <br/>
<br/>
Why do they single out the math the grammar, the ability to write things down coherantly, <br/>
especially so early on?  Why oh why?<br/>

I hoped to finally free us from this stuff, and here I am still having to do tests. <br/>

out had such traumatic consequences for her, I dont think they would ever convince me.  <br/>
She had wanted to try again for 2nd grade (this is a very tiny elementary school, with only <br/>
25 children total, for 5 grades) and because the school mates are our neighbors and <br/>
friends, people she knows, she wanted to be with them...so we tried for 5 days.  BUt the <br/>
school would meet us half way. I insisted to be there till she got past the anxiety, I insisted <br/>
that she never be left alone in the  hallway (she refuses to enter the class at first), I asked <br/>
that the first and second grades be put together (as they usually are, but were not when <br/>
she was in first grade, and again, were  not in second)...so when they wouldnt meet us for <br/>

this is really the part Im not so sure about.  In italy, so far, there is no sign of multiple <br/>
choice tests.  They do oral exams and written exams...the math is like a math worksheet, I <br/>
expect.  I dont really have a clue. Its only been a few years that they actually do tests on <br/>
elementary kids within the school.  So i really expect that they will give her some <br/>
worksheets. Ask her to write something, read and comprehend, and do some math. <br/>
<br/>
After writing this morning, my dd woke up and I got a reminder of why I am so worried. <br/>
She had a bad experience entering in the first grade. We have always done a gentle entry <br/>
for our children, letting them stay home when ever they wished, and with Shanti, she <br/>
seemed okay at first.  But bit by bit things added up (wont go into details here) and by <br/>
November she was staying home more than she was going. After the xmas holidays, we  <br/>
pulled her out, but not without her having paid for our tardiness...she had nightmares for <br/>
months and months.  So this morning, I remembered this, because she had a nightmare <br/>
again just before waking... <br/>
<br/>
And so my fears are more from the gut, I think and the rest is the cover, maybe?  I m <br/>
scared that this will cause her pain.  But Im also afraid to ask them to hold off on the test <br/>
for her...boh Im stuck.  Sometimes Im thinking if I could just shake the fear of everything, <br/>
the whole thing will flow without a problem.  <br/>
<br/>
so my question does remain however, about the test, how will this effect her experience of <br/>
whole learning, rather than fragmented learning? And should I give her a little &quot;prepping&quot; <br/>
so that she doesnt feel any sort of overwhelming &quot;I dont get this, what is it they want from <br/>
me?&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1875809447">Would she understand if you had a conversation with her about how she has to take this test just to keep them happy so she can continue to stay at home?  Just make it a &quot;it&#39;s really not a big deal, you will do as well as you can and get it over with, kind of conversation.&quot;  That you&#39;ll do something special afterwards to celebrate that it is over and she gets to stay home.  Tell her you&#39;d rather she not have to take the test (so she knows you are on her side) but it is unavoidable so we will do it and not make anything of it.  Let her know you and dad think she is wonderful exactly where she is and you know she is doing well in life - living and learning through living her interests but to continue on this path they have this test - maybe not even call it a test - just call it something different - perhaps call it &quot;they want to go over some things with you and ask you some questions.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Could you approach it from a playful aspect:  It&#39;s just a silly little rule they have about children that don&#39;t go to school.  Skip around / dance around before or afterwards.  Do something special together - go get an ice-cream cone (or what ever would be special to her).  Put on her favorite music and have a party / celebration afterwards?  Put the focus on FUN ?  Spend a lot of time planning together this special event so that she focuses on the FUN.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m rambling and throwing out some thoughts on how to approach it with your child.  Maybe some of my ramblings might help stimulate your own thoughts as you know your daughter best.<br/>
<br/>
It does sound as if you both get stressed easily, so I was trying to come up with some gentle ways to approach this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1905299490">-=-so my question does remain however, about the test, how will this  <br/>
effect her experience of<br/>
whole learning, rather than fragmented learning? -=-<br/>
<br/>
It will be part of her personal life, and her personal learning.   I  <br/>
think unschooling is way more fragmented than school-subject  <br/>
learning, and in all kinds of GOOD ways!  I don&#39;t think whole vs.  <br/>
fragmented is a good way to divide the world.<br/>
<br/>
-=-And should I give her a little &quot;prepping&quot; so that she doesnt feel  <br/>
any sort of overwhelming &quot;I dont get this, what is it they want from  <br/>
me?&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
How much prep does she want?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-844413676">I was watching a TV show from the UK recently called The Einstein<br/>
Factor. There are two teams of three - one is a resident team of<br/>
&#39;brains&#39;, the other team is made up of members of the public who are<br/>
competing against each other for the highest score, the winner each<br/>
week then goes through to the next round. The underlying implication<br/>
seemed to be that the member of the public who wins this competition<br/>
and takes home the Einstein Factor trophy has proven themselves to be<br/>
as brainy as the resident panel of brains. I think so - it was the one<br/>
and only time I&#39;ve watched the show.<br/>
<br/>
And what a crock it is. It&#39;s a remember or guess quiz show in which<br/>
the contestants are given three answers to choose from. The panel of<br/>
&#39;brains&#39; gets its chance to remember or guess first and then their<br/>
answer is compared to the answers the contestants&#39; go for. A, B or C?<br/>
<br/>
There was one particular question about Body Shop founder Anita<br/>
Roddick. Her parents came from which country? Is it (a) Italy, (b)<br/>
Croatia or (c) Greece? I think the third option was Greece. So the<br/>
panel of brains starts into this line of thinking about how Roddick<br/>
sounds Croatian and immigrants often Anglicise their family names,<br/>
perhaps Anita Roddick&#39;s family added the k after coming to England -<br/>
not even considering that Roddick might only be her surname by<br/>
marriage. So I&#39;m shaking my head as the brains go for Croatia and so<br/>
does the other team and everybody gets it wrong and I say to my wife,<br/>
who was watching with me and used to be a Body Shop consultant, &quot;I<br/>
thought everybody knew Anita Roddick&#39;s parents were Italian.&quot; Her<br/>
maiden name was Perilli, which, of course, if anybody had remembered<br/>
that, would have been a give away. So who were the brains on this<br/>
occasion - the alleged clever people on The Einstein Factor or the<br/>
tens of thousands of people who are familiar with Anita Roddick&#39;s<br/>
biography?<br/>
<br/>
The point of my story, though, is that it had little to do with any<br/>
&#39;Einstein Factor&#39;. Remembering or guessing which is the right answer<br/>
out of three given possibilities is more like a &#39;Monkey with a Pin<br/>
Factor&#39;. Not particularly useful in the real world.<br/>
<br/>
Something not totally unrelated that&#39;s on *my* mind right now. :-)<br/>
