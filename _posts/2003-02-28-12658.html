<div id="ygrps-yiv-419957208">I have always thought Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is the ultimate <br/>
unschooling movie!! When I was a new homeschooler and we would go <br/>
downtown during the day to go to the big library or museums or <br/>
whatever, the business people would give us weird looks. We gave <br/>
downtown the nickname &quot;Vulgaria&quot; , of course human services <br/>
organizations who harass homeschoolers are &quot;the Childcatcher&quot; and my <br/>
husband who is a mechanic and a junk collector extrordinaire <br/>
is &quot;Caracticus Potts&quot;. We have a 1967 Pontiac Executive which we have <br/>
driven from Ohio to Arizona and back twice...we pretend it can <br/>
fly...and we sing about &quot;the POSH POSH traveling life&quot; as we travel <br/>
in it. I just LOVE that movie!!!!<br/>
     &quot;Mr. Potts! Why aren&#39;t your children in school?...&quot;We are giving <br/>
the other children a chance to catch up!&quot; That may not be a direct <br/>
quote, it&#39;s been awhile.<br/>
