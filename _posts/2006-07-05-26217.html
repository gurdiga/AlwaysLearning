<div id="ygrps-yiv-519998562">I&#39;ve read before about how some listmembers have been able to  <br/>
introduce a lot of acceptance and love into the lives of children  <br/>
other than their own. I was hoping to get some advice from you guys  <br/>
as I try to reach my cousins son. Poor Landon has dealt with a lot,  <br/>
already a quirky kid, he&#39;s the son of military family. His parents  <br/>
love him a lot, but he does get razzed a lot about his hyperactive  <br/>
tendencies, his nonsports, computer-loving self. They try to  <br/>
encourage him, I know, but it&#39;s hard for my cousin and his wife (Lord  <br/>
knows they do better than my vicious aunt, his grandmother). My CIL  <br/>
has really been a good advocate for him in the schools, but whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I only see the guy once a year, and yesterday was it. This  <br/>
time I plan on staying in touch through letters (and maybe email if  <br/>
he trusts me enough with it later) He&#39;s fifteen and for two years now  <br/>
has been really into renderings, he&#39;s really GREAT at it, and even  <br/>
better, is so passionate about it. He spent two hours yesterday  <br/>
showing me online the ones he&#39;s done, the programs he uses, and you  <br/>
could tell he really appreciated me listening. His grandmother and my  <br/>
other cousin, his aunt, would look at them and say &quot;Those are good,  <br/>
you should keep doing this to make a lot of money&quot;, and his dad would  <br/>
walk in and though he was appreciative of the work Landon did, would  <br/>
immediately start in &quot;Why isn&#39;t your name on this one&quot;, or &quot;Why is  <br/>
that one so blurry?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;d like to mail him and tell him that I really enjoyed the  <br/>
time listening to him. Even more, i want to encourage him to follow  <br/>
his passion and not worry about money or fame, but to measure success  <br/>
by his own joy. He&#39;s fifteen, and has been through so much crap,  <br/>
verbally and physically assaulted by other base brats, moved around  <br/>
so much that he doesn&#39;t have too many friends, tortured by his  <br/>
&#39;perfect&#39; little sister (totally fits into the lifestyle, cutesie  <br/>
little cheerleader etc, who is really sweet and loving, but hard to  <br/>
live up to, KWIM?) any advice on how to encourage someone who is not  <br/>
your own, stuck in school, but such a cool kid (he&#39;s a great self- <br/>
learner)<br/>

<br/>
Maybe a copy of The Teenage Liberation Handbook, but put a paper  <br/>
cover on it (like pretty paper, or a manly-kind-of-print or color  <br/>
cloth cover) so it&#39;s not so blatantly in his parents&#39; face.  Maybe as  <br/>
a cover you could send his sister a book on cheerleading too. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a site my niece uses for printing art.  Artists have pages  <br/>
there and you can order things (or something...)<br/>
<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://resuki.deviantart.com/gallery/">http://resuki.deviantart.com/gallery/</a><br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s Gina&#39;s page.  If you click on the Gallery icon below her  <br/>
profile, you can see some of her art.  Maybe your cousin would like  <br/>
to put his things where other artists, and you and your kids, could  <br/>
see it and comment!<br/>
<br/>
This assumes he has access to a scanner or digital camera.  If he  <br/>
doesn&#39;t, maybe that&#39;s what he needs from you!<br/>
