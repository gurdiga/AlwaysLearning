<div id="ygrps-yiv-157101598">My Dad arrived from Fairbanks last night.....we will be busy sightseeing with <br/>
him, so I won&#39;t be around much for this week probably.<br/>
What I wanted to share with you all, was a gift he brought me.<br/>
It was a lovely quilt, each piece of fabric an article of clothing that was <br/>
my mothers. One of the pieces had her name and date of birth and death. Then <br/>
that poem that goes &quot;One hundred years from now, it will not matter what kind <br/>
of car I drove, what kind of house I lived in, how much money I had or what <br/>
my clothes looked like.  But the world may be a little better, the universe a <br/>
little brighter, because I was important to a child.&quot; and then a personal <br/>
note followed:<br/>
&quot;Karen (My legal name)--Your mother&#39;s mission in life was to make a <br/>
difference not just in the lives of her own children, but all children whose <br/>
lives she was able to touch.  She succeeded in both, and not it is your <br/>
priilege to carry it on to following generations.  You too will succeed, for <br/>
you have a lot of your mother in you.<br/>
In loving memory of your mother.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s when I started crying.<br/>
I thought this was one of the most poignant, sweet gifts I have ever <br/>
received. Apparently me Dad knew someone whose Father died before their first <br/>
baby was born. After the baby came along, somebody made a quilt of the <br/>
Grandfathers shirts for the baby.<br/>
He remembered this and decided to take all of my mothers clothes and have <br/>
special quilts made for each of us girls.<br/>
He&#39;s such a wonderful Daddy.  I touch each piece of cloth and remember her <br/>
wearing that outfit. I remember helping her pick out shoes for one of the <br/>
outfits while we were shopping at Jantzen Beach (Portland) one day....the <br/>
kids rode the carousel afterwards.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo.....I just thought it was a marvelous and touching thing to do, maybe <br/>
some of you have clothes of loved ones that have died and you don&#39;t know what <br/>
to do with them. <br/>
What a wonderful way to remember someone and clean out the closet at the same <br/>
time. :)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s off to the Gulfarium for us today.  We&#39;re going to feed the <br/>
dolphins..hurray!!<br/>
Hope everyone has a wonderful, beautiful, sweet, unschooling day with those <br/>
you love best.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

This was such a beautiful idea. I was crying reading it. Thank you for <br/>
sharing such a personal part of you and yours.<br/>
