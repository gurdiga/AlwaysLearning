<div id="ygrps-yiv-1020866922">I cut this off the bottom of a post about what cooking is about, and  <br/>
what housecleaning is about.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday in the chat we talked about relatives quizzing kids, and  <br/>
asking the moms questions about unschooling, and about the defensive  <br/>
feelings that can arise in the mom.    Sometimes the other person has  <br/>
no sinister purpose, but is just being awkwardly conversational.   <br/>
Sometimes they honestly want to know more about unschooling.   <br/>
Sometimes they want to be intimidating and insulting.  Rather than  <br/>
have a policy on how to respond, it&#39;s good to consider what their  <br/>
motives and intent are.<br/>
<br/>
What is their purpose in asking?<br/>
<br/>
What is the purpose of baking?<br/>
<br/>
What is the purpose of a house?  What are houses for?  What are houses  <br/>
about?<br/>
<br/>
What is learning about?<br/>
That&#39;s a good question that&#39;s been in my head lately.<br/>
What is the purpose of learning?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2144780084">About houses, I was going to look up what others had written.  I found  <br/>
a quote that said a house was a machine for living in, but that&#39;s too  <br/>
much like Krang&#39;s Android Body or the Power Rangers big bots.   My  <br/>
house isn&#39;t a machine, though the doors  might be, in a way.<br/>
<br/>
I thought of other ways to look it up, and found laws and such, but  <br/>
not philosophy.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s out there.   I did come across the  <br/>
phrase &quot;dwelling unit,&quot; to refer to whatever:  house, apartment, tent  <br/>
or just whatever it might be.<br/>

for any audience.)<br/>

This reminded me of my favorite line from a book I read years ago:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We&#39;re raising boys now.  We&#39;ll raise grass later.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I think of that anytime I start to get uptight about the house, yard, etc.<br/>

<br/>
I think of that anytime I start to get uptight about the house, yard,  <br/>
etc.-=-<br/>
<br/>
My yard this year is full and thick and a little bit prissy, even,  <br/>
because my kids are 17 and 20 and Gone, and so I&#39;m not worried that  <br/>
kids will tromp through.    When/if there are grandchildren who want  <br/>
to play in my yard, I will forego any prissiness and plan for kid- <br/>
tromping.<br/>
<br/>
Years back when we knew way in advance that a young friend was going  <br/>
to visit in October, I planted a flower house for her  (an A-frame  <br/>
morning glory house) and a pumpkin patch.  Nowadays there are trees  <br/>
and lawn where that pumpkin patch once was, but I wanted her to be  <br/>
able to pick her own jack-o-lantern, and she did and we had a great  <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of the yard is to be a place we can go to do something,  <br/>
and store some things.  This year our yard has more garden function  <br/>
than other years.  I have potatoes, onions, dill, cumin (don&#39;t know if  <br/>
that will work) and tomatoes.  But if there are years in the future  <br/>
with no edibles I won&#39;t be crushed.  We live a one-minute walk from a  <br/>
supermarket.<br/>
