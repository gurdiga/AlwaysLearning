<div id="ygrps-yiv-482762340">I was looking for the county in which Longfields is in, in England,  <br/>
and somewhere I have a photo on a blog post, so I was trying to find  <br/>
it with google, and internal site searches and such.    Is the mom of  <br/>
the family in Longfields on this list, and if so, could you e-mail me?<br/>
<br/>
So I found something bizarre instead.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m on a list of people named Sandra. That&#39;s kinda cool!   But for  <br/>
whatever reason related to Wikipedia&#39;s filing or categorization  <br/>
system, I&#39;m listed not as a writer or educator or what I would&#39;ve  <br/>
expected, but as a politician.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a little stunned by that, but I wouldn&#39;t even have found it, ever,  <br/>
if I hadn&#39;t been looking for some information I&#39;ve misplaced.<br/>
<br/>
I can go through book sales from 2008, a big pile of papers in the tax  <br/>
files.  Or I might look on other blogs.  Maybe it was in <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://thinkingsticks.blogspot.com">http://thinkingsticks.blogspot.com</a><br/>
<br/>
I love houses with names.  They do that in Mexico and South America  <br/>
some too.  Anyone else here lived in a house or a property with a  <br/>
name, rather than a number-and-street address or Rt. 1 Box 15 kind of  <br/>
address (my address when I was a kid).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I lived at &quot;The Old Vicarage&quot; in a tiny village called Donnington in Sussex, England, in the 1970s. All very &#39;Miss Marple&#39;! When my daughter was a baby, we lived for about four months of her first year, including her first Christmas, at a &quot;Rose Cottage&quot; on the outskirts of a village called Littledean in Gloucestershire, England. After that, we lived in a cottage in the village of Whiteshill, Gloucestershire, called &quot;Sycamores&quot;, until Bronnie was eight. Though there was only a single (if very big) sycamore tree in the garden, the other had long been removed before we were there. There were a lot of houses in the village that had a name rather than a number. I guess it would be more usual generally in old world places like England. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1054218459">I lived in Jamaica in (the annex of) a house called Malabar, named after the house my mother-in-law grew up in, which was in Oxford, England. Her father was from India, so for a long time I assumed he had named it, but then she told me the house had been named long before. My mother-in-law makes jams and marmalades for friends and family and labels the jars &quot;Malabar&quot;. Home.<br/>

Schuyler lives on the outskirts of an old village called Carleton  <br/>
Rode.  Their house is newish, and called &quot;Fornost.&quot;   It&#39;s in the  <br/>
corner of a big wheat field, between the barns of that farm and a row  <br/>
of modern council houses (government subsidized apartments, in  <br/>
American parlance, I think that translates).  The road bends sharply  <br/>
there, so the only part of their property that touches the road is  <br/>
just the driveway gate.  It&#39;s wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Fornost&quot; is from The Lord of the Rings.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-834166320">Ed&#39;s great grandparents had a dude ranch up in the Colorado Rockies named Silver Crags - really neat old place - it got sold out of the family in the 70&#39;s - we looked into buying it back in 1994 when it came up for sale again but the asking price was 1.7 million - a bit out of our league ;)  We took a tour of the place along with Ed&#39;s mom and she told some fun childhood stories as we walked around - they even let us go through the house (really nice people - saw us gazing at the house and property from the road - asked what we were doing and when we told them that our great-grandparents built the place they invited us in).  My mother-in-law&#39;s name was still carved into a picnic table at the shelter.  There is even a Silver Crags punch they made up that we all drink to this day.  We have a huge picture of the place hanging over our couch.   Framed along with a picture of his great grandparents, a post card they sent out at Christmas with the same picture on it, and a current picture of the gate post with Silver Crags on it.  It is a winter picture in sepia tones and is so beautiful with the mountains, snow, pines and the stone house.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up in Southern Illinois, in a very rural area and most people didn&#39;t even have their name on the mail boxes - only a mailbox.  Mail was simply addressed to rural route &quot;#&quot;  and then the nearest town.  For example  your name then rural route number, town, state.  Our farm had a name but not many mentioned it by name though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-235167174">Does a building name count? When I was a girl in Hong Kong we lived in a<br/>
high rise apartment building called &quot;Chungking Mansions&quot;. Part of the time<br/>
we lived in a boarding house within the building. Then later (next time we<br/>
came back to Hong Kong) we lived in a two bedroom apartment on the 16th<br/>
floor. Mansions?<br/>
