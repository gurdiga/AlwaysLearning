<div id="ygrps-yiv-485319740">Kirby forwarded me this because I&#39;m taking him to get a money order today to <br/>
buy some costume part for a friend&#39;s anime costume for an upcoming convention.<br/>
<br/>
He misspelled (or rather used the wrong) &quot;since.&quot;  Other than that, it&#39;s <br/>
pretty good writing for someone who&#39;s never had any spelling, grammar or <br/>
composition lessons but learned it all from reading and writing and asking the <br/>
occasional question.  And better than the technicality is that he used it for a real <br/>
reason, and he wrote something sweet to a stranger just because.  He&#39;s making <br/>
the world a little better for this costumer/artist and for the friend for whom <br/>
he&#39;s buying the surprise shades.<br/>

&gt;Hey.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Yeah I am interested!  How do you want payment? And what all do you need to<br/>
&gt;know.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I looked around your website and I gotta tell you. Your costumes are <br/>
&gt;Awesome!<br/>
&gt;I myself have been a huge Black Mage fan sense...I can remember. And when<br/>
&gt;Final Fantasy X came out Lulu jumped to the top of the list. You most <br/>
&gt;likely hear<br/>
&gt;this all the time but in any case I think your Lulu Costume is one of the<br/>
&gt;best I have ever seen.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well let me know how it all works.<br/>
&gt;Kirby. </span></blockquote></div>
