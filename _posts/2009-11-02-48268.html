<div id="ygrps-yiv-1281202760">So about two months ago we lifted pretty much any and all restrictions, including food.  Complete foray into radical unschooling.  We love the outcome.  Love what it is doing for our family.  Love the togetherness.  My kids, though, are still pretty much eating like they are at a carnival everyday.  Lots of fruit snacks (when we have them), candy, popcorn, chips, treats.  They really never eat an actual meal.  Never eat vegetables, and only occasionally eat fruit. We tried the monkey platter.  They tend to pick off any meats and/or crackers on there and leave the rest.  Sometimes they will eat the apples.  I guess I am just looking for some reassurance that at some point a vegetable may pass their lips again.  I wasn&#39;t a great veggie eater when I was young.  My parents were hippies and very hands off -- no rules, no restrictions.  Eventually, I learned to like veggies, so I am probably worrying for nothing, but I worry nonetheless because they are living on crap right now.</div>

You&#39;ve contradicted yourself all in one paragraph.   I was pretty  <br/>
happy to read that you were loving the outcome.<br/>
I was confused, then to read this:<br/>
<br/>

for nothing, but I worry nonetheless because they are living on crap  <br/>
right now.<br/>

<br/>
If you&#39;re thinking of any food as &quot;crap&quot; and if you&#39;re thinking your  <br/>
kids are eating &quot;crap,&quot; things aren&#39;t going as well as you think they  <br/>
are.  Or maybe, as often happens, your understanding has moved ahead  <br/>
of your verbal ability.  It happens with little kids all the time. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s how it happens with moms:  We have voices and phrases in our  <br/>
heads that aren&#39;t coming from a mindful place of actual thought.  It&#39;s  <br/>
as though there are scripts we can fall into and continue a  <br/>
conversation on auto-pilot.   It&#39;s as dangerous to do that as it is to  <br/>
drive a car without remembering where you meant to go.  It&#39;s not as  <br/>
physically dangerous; you&#39;re unlikely to kill a stranger or destroy a  <br/>
car.   You&#39;re in danger of ruining unschooling&#39;s chance of survival at  <br/>
your house, though, and of wounding your children and your family&#39;s  <br/>
peace.<br/>
<br/>
Your children are not living on crap.  Take that back, in your head  <br/>
and in your heart.   You told a thousand strangers your kids are  <br/>
living on crap, even though you were a kid who wasn&#39;t crazy about  <br/>
vegetables either.  You said when you put a monkey platter out (when  <br/>
you &quot;tried&quot; one--what&#39;s to try?  DO IT!  More than once) they ate the  <br/>
meat and crackers.  That&#39;s good!  There are people forcing their kids  <br/>
to eat meat and crackers all over the world right now.  Yours did it  <br/>
joyfully.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some examples of the kinds of things moms will think, and say  <br/>
and write (and re-read and still post) about their own beloved children:<br/>

<br/>
Do you think there are, in the world some &quot;Great Veggie Eaters&quot;?  I  <br/>
was thinking more about the odd disjointness of the descriptions of  <br/>
food.  It was like a swirl of attitudes and emotions.  And many people  <br/>
do live in a swirl of contradictory messages about what is &quot;good food&quot;  <br/>
and &quot;bad food&quot; and about &quot;self control&quot; and &quot;good eaters.&quot;   Eating  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t be a contest.  Sometimes it is.<br/>
<br/>
I was at rehab this morning, for my leg.  Two more sessions and I  <br/>
&quot;graduate.&quot;<br/>
That&#39;s the only place I see the news.  Last week some people died of  <br/>
dehydration, and someone&#39;s in trouble.<br/>
This week, someone died of drinking too much water, and someone&#39;s in  <br/>
trouble.<br/>
<br/>
When people accept the skewed idea that they should eat or drink what  <br/>
others tell them to, when others tell them to, because others told  <br/>
them to (or not to) that&#39;s not healthy.   But our culture is so  <br/>
screwed up with what&#39;s okay for which people when, where and why that  <br/>
many people don&#39;t have a CLUE what their body needs.<br/>
<br/>
One of the stories I learned in a psychology class in college was that  <br/>
any substance can kill a person, even drinking too much water.  The  <br/>
case study was a woman whose father had died, and she started drinking  <br/>
water.  I don&#39;t know why.  I don&#39;t think he died of dehydration.  But  <br/>
she drank water in such quantity and so quickly in those first two  <br/>
days after he died that she drowned from the inside, basically. So  <br/>
there&#39;s something I learned  in college that would have saved my  <br/>
life.  And maybe saved some other people&#39;s lives if I had been where  <br/>
there was a water drinking contest.  I would have had no hesitation at  <br/>
all about walking up and telling the DJs that one of those people  <br/>
could die.<br/>
<br/>
Most people are afraid and so used to being controlled and so used to  <br/>
letting other people do their thinking that they have forgotten how to  <br/>
think clearly (if they ever could) and how to make simple little  <br/>
decisions (if they ever had the chance to even try it, as kids or  <br/>
young adults).<br/>
<br/>
I was very happy at rehab and could do all the exercises they had me  <br/>
do, and they added some new ones.   I don&#39;t mind watching TV while I&#39;m  <br/>
there doing them, either, but I wish there were more shows about  <br/>
people thinking clearly and making great decisions.<br/>

<br/>
Thinking of some foods as &quot;real&quot; and others as any form of unreal is  <br/>
going to be as much a problem as dividing the world into fun and  <br/>
learning, as though they were separate things.<br/>
<br/>
A point like that shouldn&#39;t crush the feelings of anyone old enough to  <br/>
be a mother, or anyone bright enough to consider unschooling.   A  <br/>
point like that can, and will, and does regularly help someone make  <br/>
another level toward &quot;beating the game&quot; of deschooling.   It&#39;s not  <br/>
easy for people to recover from ten or twenty years of schooling, but  <br/>
people do it.  They don&#39;t do it from being supported to stay where  <br/>
they are and be satisfied with muddly thinking and negativity, though.<br/>
<br/>
My children ate real food when they started nursing.  They ate real  <br/>
food when they tasted mashed foods off the ends of people&#39;s fingers,  <br/>
or strained fruit.  They ate real food when they tasted other people&#39;s  <br/>
food when they were toddlers but weren&#39;t forced to taste it, nor  <br/>
pressed to finish it.   They have always eaten real food, their whole  <br/>
lives.<br/>

 <br/>
Wow!  Really?  You&#39;re a few months into it and you&#39;re being very defensive.  Unschooling takes a while to really get into practice, it takes many defensive moments to learn from and change.  My oldest is 15.  We came to unschooling when she was 5, it&#39;s been years in the making.<br/>
<br/>
There have been many times when I&#39;ve said something and people have called me on it.... THOSE are the learning moments, those are the things that I need to examine the most.  That feeling of defensiveness is the first clue that I&#39;m onto something that I need to change big time!<br/>
 <br/>
If Sandra hadn&#39;t said what she said, I would&#39;ve said something VERY similar, because I had the very same thoughts go through my head about how you described food and how you portrayed what was happening in your household.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Protein and carbohydrates aren&#39;t &#39;crap&#39;. They&#39;re essential parts of the<br/>
human diet.<br/>
<br/>
I can ony speak for my own children, and my eldest is only ten, but in my<br/>
experience children eat different things according to their growth cycle: at<br/>
times they will eat vast amounts of carbs, put on a lot of weight, then<br/>
suddenly shoot up - at which point they&#39;ll eat more protein. that<br/>
observation really helped me trust that they know far better than I what<br/>
they need to eat. But something else helped me as well.<br/>
<br/>
My eldest daughter was diagnosed with PDA when she was just nine; it was an<br/>
easily fixed problem but because her heart, for nine years, was working far<br/>
harder than normal it was using up every bit of energy she had to spare. I<br/>
&#39;controlled&#39; what she ate for five years, feeling vaguely guilty about<br/>
&#39;giving in&#39; and letting her fill up on biscuits and sweetened yoghurts when<br/>
I couldn&#39;&#39;t persuade her to eat the &#39;good&#39; stuff. She was tiny at four, even<br/>
the smallest size school uniform had to be taken up four inches to fit her<br/>
and most of a school year later it still fitted easily. She came out of<br/>
school every day crying with exhaustion and had to be fed chocolate even to<br/>
get the energy to walk to the car.<br/>
<br/>
Then, two and a half terms after she started school we deregistered her to<br/>
home educate, and a couple of months after that I came across Schuyler<br/>
online, with her (what seemed to me) radical ideas about not restricting<br/>
food. Shortly after we stopped controlling her food Charlotte had the first<br/>
real growth spurt she&#39;d ever had. We worried that she seemed to eat mostly<br/>
chocolate and cake but kept our worries to ourselves since she stayed (very)<br/>
slim and was healthier than she&#39;d ever been before though still lacking in<br/>
energy.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s still really small and only started putting on weight and growing<br/>
properly after the operation to fix her heart, but the surgeon was surprised<br/>
at how little damage her condition had done - apart from her small size and<br/>
a barely noticeable enlargement of one chamber of her heart she&#39;s normal,<br/>
healthy and strong.<br/>
<br/>
 If we&#39;d stuck with controlling how much sugar she ate and making her go to<br/>
school and run around with the other children we could actually have made<br/>
her very, very sick - all with the best intentions of course. Instead we<br/>
spent several years supporting her in what she felt she needed, even when it<br/>
didn&#39;t look &#39;normal&#39; to us, and it turned out to be the best thing we could<br/>
possibly have done. And she turned out pretty brilliant at dealing with her<br/>
needs, once we gave her a chance.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry this turned out long.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-340117272">-=I&#39;m sorry this turned out long.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t think it was long at all.  It was really interesting.<br/>
<br/>
The idea that a child can just feel instinctively whether a food is  <br/>
good for her at that time or not isn&#39;t anything I had ever heard at  <br/>
all until I read an article in Mothering Magazine (don&#39;t know which  <br/>
issue or who wrote it, but would like to know!  I gave away all my old  <br/>
magazines once) that said if you get a balanced diet&#39;s worth of a  <br/>
week&#39;s worth of food (awkwardly stated; sorry) and let a toddler  <br/>
choose what to eat when, it will balance out within the space of that  <br/>
week.<br/>
<br/>
Something like that.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
And Kirby was a baby, and it gave me a lot of confidence that maybe he  <br/>
was smart beyond his verbalization, so we never forced food on him,  <br/>
nor prohibited any.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1589590887">I&#39;m really sorry that food is stressing you out.  I can truly relate to this<br/>
issue.  One thing that has really helped me to let go is to only have what I<br/>
consider to be &quot;real&quot; food in my home.  If I don&#39;t buy what I would label as<br/>
&quot;crap&quot; then it&#39;s impossible for my kids to eat it... at least when we are at<br/>
home which is most of the time.  My children are almost four and 5.5 and<br/>
they eat only healthy foods.  They don&#39;t seem to mind this.  I&#39;ve even asked<br/>
them before if they would like to eat other types of food and they say no.<br/>
I don&#39;t even think that they would like the &quot;crap&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I would also agree with some of the others on this thread that kids do tend<br/>
to eat more of certain foods at times than they do at other times.  But<br/>
again if they are craving and asking for carbs then have lots of healthy<br/>
carbs on hand.<br/>
<br/>
I think that it is important to help mentor our children about the food they<br/>
eat.  Food is a very important factor when it comes to our immune systems.<br/>
I explain this to my children.  I model good eating habits for my kids.  If<br/>
I don&#39;t want my kids to eat for instance McDonalds then they will never see<br/>
me eating that food.  I blog &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bonafidemama.com/">http://www.bonafidemama.com/</a>&gt; a great deal<br/>
about healthy foods and I&#39;d be happy to talk privately with you as well.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-170601468">I have 4 boys by birth.  They have always been allowed to eat whenever and whatever they want.  Food have not been an issue in our house.  Now that being said we adopted a little girl at the age of 8. She has suffered starvation and food restrictions.  Since she has been with us (two years) she has doubled her weight.  She is now 5&#39;2&quot; and weighs 170lbs.  I feel like I am hurting her by allowing her free reign over her intake.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
She is very sneaky with food.  She takes food or drinks from other people. Example: We went to the movies with their Nana who bought drinks and sweets and popcorn for everyone.  I looked over and saw her drinking from her Nana&#39;s cup several times. ( I did not acknowledge this to her)   If I get them something to share she gets extremely upset. Example: The other day we were out longer then I expected.  I only had enough money to buy 2 sub sandwiches from Subway.  There were 4 of us.  I offered this choice to everyone and they all agreed.  But then once inside when she really realized she was sharing ( I explained this in the car) she fell to pieces.  She refused to make any choices.  So I made the choices taking into consideration her likes and by the time we were in the car she was in tears.  I was not mean to her and I stayed calm.  She did eat her half of the sandwich.  She has to control food for others too she will yell at our 5 year old for eating chips in the morning, I have always allowed chips in the morning.    We do not limit the kids candy after Halloween after a few days I have always put their left over candy into one bowl and that works for everyone except for her.  She will get upset so last year I kept her candy separate and combined the others and she ate theirs till it was gone before going to hers.  This created a situation where she had candy and no one else did.  She likes to hold it over their heads.  This is the same for things like cereal too.  Everyone will choose a cereal and she will pick something no one else likes and then will not even open it till all the other cereal is gone.  I have thoughts of only letting her eat her choice but I think that is mean too.  I would really like to defuse this situations.  I am at a loss for what to do.  I know that she is picking up negative attitude from me in this regard and that I think is due to the fact that I feel I have to protect the boys fare share.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My thinking was that given every opportunity to control her own intake some of these behaviors would subside.  The major improvement I have seen is she no longer eats till she throws up.   I would really like to hear what you all observe about this.  Perhaps I need an attitude adjustment or maybe this will take more time that I thought.  Has anyone else dealt with this type of behavior?  I do not want her to grow up having food issues, and I especially do not want to be a person in her life to add or create food issues.  <br/>

-=-How long did it take your kids to eat &quot;real&quot; food?-=- <br/>
<br/>
Thinking of some foods as &quot;real&quot; and others as any form of unreal is <br/>
going to be as much a problem as dividing the world into fun and <br/>
learning, as though they were separate things. <br/>
<br/>
A point like that shouldn&#39;t crush the feelings of anyone old enough to <br/>
be a mother, or anyone bright enough to consider unschooling. A <br/>
point like that can, and will, and does regularly help someone make <br/>
another level toward &quot;beating the game&quot; of deschooling. It&#39;s not <br/>
easy for people to recover from ten or twenty years of schooling, but <br/>
people do it. They don&#39;t do it from being supported to stay where <br/>
they are and be satisfied with muddly thinking and negativity, though. <br/>
<br/>
My children ate real food when they started nursing. They ate real <br/>
food when they tasted mashed foods off the ends of people&#39;s fingers, <br/>
or strained fruit. They ate real food when they tasted other people&#39;s <br/>
food when they were toddlers but weren&#39;t forced to taste it, nor <br/>
pressed to finish it. They have always eaten real food, their whole <br/>
lives. <br/>
<br/>
Stories of hundreds of kids are here and at links from this: <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1567912759">I¹ve been thinking this for the last 8months or so since I came properly to<br/>
take unschooling on board.  I have a 4.5 year old and a 16mth old.  Its just<br/>
about the notion of support¹.    I have been on attachment<br/>
parenting/alternative mothering lists/sites since my 4 year old was born.<br/>
He is what some would call highly spirited¹ so I have had lots of questions<br/>
and heart aches and confusion surrounding him and have sought out lots of<br/>
advice and support from these lovely lists and sites and although I have had<br/>
help from them and spoke to many helpful and supportive women ­ I was<br/>
actually beginning to get frustrated with support¹ - I really wanted<br/>
answers to help me sort out this confusing messy mothering life ­ more than<br/>
support.<br/>
<br/>
Then I stubble across sandras site and join up to the lists and do lots of<br/>
reading and start to implement what I am learning ­ all starting 8mths ago.<br/>
Well I can say that in those 8mths I have moved on 10times more in my<br/>
parenting than I have for the previous 3+ years were I was getting lots of<br/>
lovely support.  Our family is far from perfect and I have so much more to<br/>
learn ­ I feel I have but scratched the surface as yet.  I have had the<br/>
horrible uncomfortable challenged feelings etc ­ its not nice, its hard to<br/>
face, but it does make you grow and stretch if you can bear the<br/>
uncomfortableness of it!<br/>
<br/>
Oh and sandra ­ I loved that support link ­ was really funny!<br/>
<br/>
Hope that ok for me to say all that!<br/>

Has anyone else dealt with this type of behavior? -=-<br/>
<br/>
My younger cousin.  She was a food hoarder as a kid.  We had six  <br/>
people and when there were a dozen of something, each person could  <br/>
have two, and only two.  She would eat one and save her other (donut  <br/>
or cookie or whatever) until all the rest were gone, and would eat it  <br/>
in front of us.  There was a cruelty to it, kind of a sadistic &quot;AHA!    <br/>
I am making you hungry!&quot; but I think it was because she had suffered a  <br/>
lot of hurt and deprivation and was passing it back out.<br/>
<br/>
I think your daughter already has food issues and they&#39;re not of your  <br/>
making.  Just because she gets fat for a while doesn&#39;t mean she&#39;ll  <br/>
always be.  Or maybe she will always be.  But it&#39;s not your doing.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry for your boys, though.  My parents didn&#39;t &quot;save&quot; my cousins  <br/>
by bringing them into our home, and it made my life and my sisters&#39;  <br/>
very hard.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Everyone will choose a cereal and she will pick something no one  <br/>
else likes and then will not even open it till all the other cereal is  <br/>
gone.  I have thoughts of only letting her eat her choice but I think  <br/>
that is mean too.  I would really like to defuse this situations.  I  <br/>
am at a loss for what to do.  I know that she is picking up negative  <br/>
attitude from me in this regard and that I think is due to the fact  <br/>
that I feel I have to protect the boys fare share.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
Are the boys all older than the ten year old girl?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could ask whether she would like to have her own food  <br/>
separate or to share.  Dont&#39; let her say &quot;both.&quot;  Or let her, but  <br/>
gradually point out the unfairness of it.  If she wants hers separate,  <br/>
then mark hers and tell her to leave the shared bowl of candy or  <br/>
cereal alone.   She&#39;ll get tired of that pretty soon, I bet.  But  <br/>
&quot;pretty soon&quot; in her case might still be years.<br/>

<br/>
Please back away from dividing food into &quot;real&quot; and &quot;crap.&quot;  It&#39;s not  <br/>

Unless you don&#39;t expect your kids to grow to adulthood, your theory  <br/>
that it&#39;s &quot;impossible&quot; for them to get what you consider to be bad is  <br/>
a very bad theory.<br/>
<br/>
I had a niece stay with us many years ago whose parents were natural  <br/>
food fanatics.  She was never EVER allowed to even taste anything that  <br/>
had refined sugar in it.  Not even a little bit.  She was five, and we  <br/>
lost her.  It was a six-acre property so I wasn&#39;t too worried about  <br/>
finding her, but when I did I discovered why she hadn&#39;t answered when  <br/>
we called her.  She was squatting in the garden between rows of  <br/>
vegetables, with a paper bag of sugar she&#39;d gotten from the pantry,  <br/>
and she was eating it as fast as she could, one hand at her mouth and  <br/>
the other in the bag, back and forth, knowing she would be caught and  <br/>
it would be taken away from her.<br/>
<br/>
Her mom wasn&#39;t there.  I didn&#39;t yell at her at all.  I was kind to  <br/>
her.  It was a huge example of what comes of limits, though.    <br/>
Desperation, sneakiness, and the wild desire to eat sugar straight  <br/>
from the bag.<br/>
<br/>
My kids haven&#39;t been limited or deprived, and they don&#39;t open the  <br/>
little sugar packets at restaurants and eat them.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I think that it is important to help mentor our children about the  <br/>
food they eat.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think of myself as my children&#39;s food mentor.  I&#39;ve been their  <br/>
provider and comfort and partner.  The youngest of three turned 18  <br/>
today.  They&#39;re healthy and bright.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
I just got tired of people saying &quot;I came here for support, and you&#39;re  <br/>
telling me what I&#39;m doing wrong.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well...  yeah.  Because people come here (if they&#39;ve read the intro)  <br/>
to get help to move toward unschooling and away from traditional  <br/>
parenting.<br/>
<br/>
Some people do love to be told that what they&#39;re doing is just as good  <br/>
as anything anyone has ever done or ever could, and that unschooling  <br/>
is just whatever anyone wants it to be.<br/>
<br/>
Why would I spend years of time to give people that worthless pap?   <br/>
There&#39;s no joy in putting smiley-face bandaids on gaping wounds.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not here to &quot;support&quot; mothers who are badmouthing their children.   <br/>
I&#39;m here to support children whose mothers think maybe there&#39;s a  <br/>
better way to be generous and peaceful and mindful with their children.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1595199558">I meant that in my home as long as they are in my home they won&#39;t be eating<br/>
it simply because it&#39;s not here.  It&#39;s true that I can&#39;t control what<br/>
happens when they are out of my sight but it will be a while until I need to<br/>
contend with that.  My son and I both have some health issues which make it<br/>
pretty important that we avoid sugars... including large amounts of honey<br/>
and maple syrup.  We use low glycemic sweeteners in our home.  I feel that<br/>
it&#39;s my job to keep him healthy and for him to not end up in a diabetic<br/>
coma.<br/>
<br/>
And my children have had refined sweeteners.  Just in moderation... which<br/>
happens organically for our family since we just don&#39;t keep that stuff<br/>
around the house.  If we are out and about we might have a little.  As long<br/>
as we don&#39;t make a big deal out of it, it&#39;s really a nonissue.  Certainly no<br/>
break downs or fights or leg biting!  Just maybe a little bargaining and a<br/>
reminder that we want to stay healthy with our blood sugar and ALWAYS a safe<br/>
alternative.<br/>
<br/>
I think we&#39;ve all heard stories about children who have binged on<br/>
sugar/sweets as a result of being restricted.  I hate that that happened.  I<br/>
know that my mom told me a story of hiding out with a bag of cookies when<br/>
she was a kid.  She was allowed to eat sugar.  She just wanted to eat all of<br/>
the centers from the cookies so she took the bag, hid, and ate them all.  It<br/>
was just something that happened.  Not because she was restricted but<br/>
because she had a mission!  Just this weekend my son ate a large amount of<br/>
the low sugar &quot;healthier&quot; snacks and he complained of a tummy ache.  I asked<br/>
him if maybe it was because he had eaten more treats than normal and he<br/>
agreed that it could have been that and he&#39;d back off for a little while.<br/>
No tears.  Tummy ache went away.  Lesson learned.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My take when it comes to this type of thing is that it isn&#39;t about food-- it is about &quot;enough.&quot;  It is about not having had enough in her life . . .in her case, it sounds like she had far from enough of even the most basic of needs.  She suffered for 6 critical years of her development, and has only been with you two-- not even half the time of what she endured.<br/>
<br/>
I would say, continue not focusing on food, her weight, etc. and instead remember that she is still going through and testing that &quot;trust vs. mistrust stage&quot; (according to Erikson, the very first conflict we deal with in life!) because her needs have not been met for so long.  Anything you do in terms of restricting food is only going to set her back-- she will again fear that she will not get enough.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-776649087">I have two comments on this subject...<br/>
<br/>
Someone just posted about the guy who eats a lot of sugar and candy etc.  I loved that article!!  My experience with foods have lead me to sickness and near death (cancer).  My grandparents who mostly raised me, allowed me to eat whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted.  They did at one point try and restrict sugar foods for a bit because they believed it was making my touretts worse.  Thankfully they gave up on this!!  Anyhow, we all sat down together for dinner, no matter what, but it was more about being together and talking then eating veggies.  I was always really healthy and at a perfect weight!!  It wasn&#39;t until I grew older and let &quot;society&quot; into my head that I started to try and eat healthy.  I started getting sick all the time, etc.  My weight ballooned.  I even asked my doctor if I could be allergic to vegetables.  He, of course, scoffed this idea.  Then... finally I got it!!!  I started eating foods that I wanted to eat.  Foods that my body wanted me to eat, and I am finally healing.  I have some bowel issues that are healing, but I know that if I continue to do what my body tells me, I will be back on the path of my dreams.  I don&#39;t eat meals, I eat breakfast later in the day and sometimes even have cereal for dinner.  Sometimes I crave a salad or some steamed veggies.  I love fruit and totally love chocolate!!  My grandfather, who is 85 eats either a whole pie, cake, a pan of cinnamon rolls, a package of cookies, etc. everyday!!!  He is fit as a fiddle.  He swears that water will rust his insides so he drinks coffee and koolaid when he&#39;s thirsty.  Here&#39;s the kicker... he has smoked since he was 8 years old!!!  (He grew up on a farm where it was execeptable for boys to smoke early.)  I believe that he has a firm believe that he is healthy and no matter what, food nor smoking, etc. will kill him.  He&#39;ll go when he&#39;s ready to.  Amazing!!<br/>
<br/>
Secondly...  I do hope that Jerritt will come back eventually.  I know when I first started reading and asking questions here, I felt rebuked or rebuffed myself.  Now that I have let unschooling sink in and have learned that when I feel contrast, there is probably a good reason, and that it is within myself.  I investigate and see why I feel contrast and make sure I&#39;m not swimming up stream instead of floating downstream where life is easier.  <br/>

I agree.<br/>

Would giving her more opportunities to make decisions that affect you  <br/>
or the house or the schedule?  Maybe she needs power and influence.<br/>
<br/>
When she has money what does she like to buy?<br/>
<br/>
Does she have any interest in sports or dance or hiking or anything  <br/>
physical?  Maybe exertion of large muscles would help her be relaxed  <br/>
and tired.  If she has a lot of  angst and energy it might distract  <br/>
her from thinking about food.  Not in a manipulative way, but just to  <br/>
see if there are other ways for her to feel focussed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-996997186">***One thing that has really helped me to let go is to only have what I<br/>
consider to be &quot;real&quot; food in my home. If I don&#39;t buy what I would label as<br/>
&quot;crap&quot; then it&#39;s impossible for my kids to eat it... ***<br/>
 <br/>
That works for a while with very young children.  As long as you don&#39;t visit other people&#39;s houses who consider different food to be &quot;real&quot;, or go to family gatherings and potlucks.  This is very much how I grew up, and let me tell you that it didn&#39;t help me learn how to listen to my body at all.  I chose not to repeat that with my own children.<br/>
 <br/>
*** My children are almost four and 5.5 and<br/>
they eat only healthy foods.***<br/>
 <br/>
Or another way to rephrase that is that they only eat foods that mom considers healthy, it seems clear that the kids don&#39;t get to decide this for themselves.<br/>
 <br/>
 ***They don&#39;t seem to mind this.***<br/>
 <br/>
Not yet perhaps.<br/>
 <br/>
***I&#39;ve even asked<br/>
them before if they would like to eat other types of food and they say no.<br/>
I don&#39;t even think that they would like the &quot;crap&quot;.***<br/>
 <br/>
That seems like entrapment.  What kind of &quot;other&quot; foods are being offered?  Really think about that... You are offering food, or &quot;other&quot; food.  It&#39;s all food.  Some of it has been given a value with positive and some of it has been given a negative value.  How are kids to grow up learning how to make good choices for themselves if someone else is always doing it for them? <br/>
<br/>
***I think that it is important to help mentor our children about the food they<br/>
eat.***<br/>
 <br/>
What&#39;s important is to help our kids learn how to make good choices for themselves.  I don&#39;t want my children to parrot everything I say, I want them to think their own thoughts and have their own ideas.  Sometimes you have kids that actually agree with you on lots of things, but that&#39;s not going to happen if parents try to control or restrict children, even if it&#39;s &quot;for their own good&quot;, like eating some foods and avoiding others to help our immune system. <br/>
  <br/>
***If I don&#39;t want my kids to eat for instance McDonalds then they will never see<br/>
me eating that food. ***<br/>
 <br/>
I never eat at McDonalds, but my kids have both enjoyed many a happy meal over the years, largely because of the toys, and each of them have eaten what they liked and discarded the rest.  My 15 yr old hasn&#39;t eaten at McD&#39;s in years and my youngest has eaten a few bites of food from there a few times in the last 6 mos.  Both of them would choose Subway over most places for fastfood, or a bento place or sushi place.  <br/>
 <br/>
My goal for not eating at McD&#39;s myself was not to encourage my kids not to eat, it was because I can&#39;t eat most things from there.  Which goes back to my own childhood and issues around food and not learning about, and not being able to listen to my own body&#39;s cues because my own parents were quite sure they new what was best and healthiest for my body.<br/>

&gt; diabetic<br/>
&gt; coma.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I worked with a woman with a 20ish yo son who was diabetic and self- <br/>
destructive about it. When allowed to he made all sorts of deadly  <br/>
choices. He also had a mother who saw her role as the keeper of his  <br/>
health. The connection between the two is pretty obvious! He wasn&#39;t  <br/>
fighting health. He was fighting for the freedom to decide. But since  <br/>
his mom had limited his choices to her choices and bad choices, his  <br/>
need to own his decisions made the bad choices the only other choice  <br/>
he could make for himself.<br/>
<br/>
Moms have helped their 3 yos with strategies on how to handle  <br/>
allergies. It can become a natural part of eating to say &quot;Let&#39;s check  <br/>
the ingredients to see if there are peanuts in this,&quot; and then  <br/>
helping a child acquire something that&#39;s as good or even better if it  <br/>
does have peanuts. The more information kids gather, the more they  <br/>
get a feel for what foods are typically safe and which need to be  <br/>
checked.<br/>
<br/>
The problem in these discussions is that controllers seem to limit  <br/>
themselves to two choices: control or total child anarchy with the  <br/>
powerless parent watching from the background wringing her hands.  <br/>
There *are* more choices. Just because the suggestion is to give kids  <br/>
choices it doesn&#39;t mean load the house up with snack foods! It means  <br/>
writing down on the shopping list what the kids would like you to buy  <br/>
for them.  It means adopting the attitude of an adventurer about  <br/>
trying different foods. It means helping them decide for themselves  <br/>
what they like and don&#39;t like -- without Mom loading the experience  <br/>
with messages about the choice she thinks is right.<br/>
<br/>
If the kids want to try Oreos, say yes. You could buy several  <br/>
different brands including organice and taste test. You could look at  <br/>
the ingredients in an investigative way rather than a &quot;look how much  <br/>
junk is in this&quot; way. I read ingredients in the store because they  <br/>
are important to *my* choices. When comparing two items for myself, I  <br/>
look for the fewest &quot;unpronounceables.&quot; The attitude *for my choices*  <br/>
has always been &quot;Why choose something with all those chemicals when  <br/>
you don&#39;t have to?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the answer is because there isn&#39;t something else like it.  <br/>
Sometimes the answer is, let&#39;s try it and see.  I do it because I  <br/>
think it&#39;s practical and sensible. There&#39;s no fear involved.<br/>
<br/>
Because I didn&#39;t make my daughter check the ingredients in her  <br/>
choices, because it was a natural part of shopping and seemed to make  <br/>
sense to her, she has often checked the ingredients and tended to  <br/>
avoid chemicals when there were options. But she also doesn&#39;t feel  <br/>
guilty if she does choose something with an ingredient list  <br/>
practically too large for the package ;-)<br/>

<br/>
&quot;I meant that in my home as long as she&#39;s in my home, my wife won&#39;t  <br/>

<br/>
Does that feel like a loving partnership? No matter how convinced  <br/>
your husband is that those things are damaging, no matter how loving  <br/>
he feels in protecting you from them, controlling them for someone  <br/>
else doesn&#39;t feel like love. It feels like &quot;I don&#39;t care what you  <br/>
want. What I want for you is more important.&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t trust that  <br/>
you&#39;re strong enough to handle the world so I need to limit you to  <br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Rather than being let loose into the world with someone&#39;s checklist  <br/>
of healthy eating, wouldn&#39;t knowing how to make choices that are  <br/>
important to them be more helpful? Isn&#39;t exploring freely to discover  <br/>
what they like and what they don&#39;t like a more useful life skill than  <br/>
absorbing your beliefs about what&#39;s good for them?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; which happens organically for our family since we just don&#39;t keep  <br/>

&gt; as we don&#39;t make a big deal out of it, it&#39;s really a nonissue.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Be honest in your thoughts and thinking will be clearer. *You* don&#39;t  <br/>
keep that stuff around the house, not &quot;we&quot;. Are you a  monolithic  <br/>
being so that when one person has a little, you all have a little?  <br/>
Your kids are individuals. You&#39;re an individual. If all of you are  <br/>
choosing a sweet when out of the house, then your attitude has turned  <br/>
what could be a food to choose or not choose based on what someone  <br/>
feels like into a desired treat that needs taken advantage of because  <br/>
it&#39;s available right now. (That&#39;s not a bad or good thing, but  <br/>
something to be aware of.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Just maybe a little bargaining and a<br/>
&gt; reminder that we want to stay healthy with our blood sugar and  <br/>
&gt; ALWAYS a safe<br/>
&gt; alternative.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What if your husband were convinced that secular novels where the  <br/>
tools of the devil? What if he might let you read a short story  <br/>
outside the house under his supervision? What if when you went into  <br/>
the book store, he steered you toward the safe alternatives: the  <br/>
Christian versions of the genres you wanted to read?<br/>
<br/>
At one time maps were marked with &quot;Here there be dragons.&quot; (Or it  <br/>
makes a good story, anyway ;-) It kept most people in line and &quot;safe&quot;  <br/>
to believe that. But some set off on their own and found there  <br/>
weren&#39;t dragons. And it&#39;s doubtful that they&#39;d think kind thoughts of  <br/>
those who wrote &quot;Here there be dragons.&quot; Controlling ignoramuses  <br/>
would be more like it ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Your kids *will* meet plenty of seemly perfectly healthy kids who are  <br/>
eating what you consider crap. What will your kids conclude from  <br/>
that? That maybe mom isn&#39;t the expert that she thinks she is? Or  <br/>
maybe that their own judgement is faulty and that experts have it all  <br/>
sorted out so it&#39;s just easier to listen to the experts than to think  <br/>
about things? (Kids in school often learn this lesson well!) Or  <br/>
they&#39;ll feel guilty when they find they like some &quot;crap&quot; food the  <br/>
kids give them? Or they&#39;ll feel the need to pass on the right way to  <br/>
eat because obviously the kids&#39; parents are clueless and don&#39;t care?  <br/>
(Some kids have been told by fundamentalist kids that they&#39;re going  <br/>
to hell for liking Harry Potter.)<br/>
<br/>
That all seems extreme, but the extremes tend to illuminate the  <br/>
feelings that rumble beneath the surface. When the world is divided  <br/>
between good food and crap food, it&#39;s hard to avoid feeling some  <br/>
guilt about eating crap! When it&#39;s all food and kids can decide  <br/>
what&#39;s right for them right now, then make  choices based on what  <br/>
their body needs, not on what they&#39;ve memorized that some expert  <br/>
decided their body needs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1411726982">Thank you for these ideas and thoughts.  I agree that I could start making<br/>
our eating choices more of a group effort.  I certainly love the idea of<br/>
making reading the ingredients in order to to pick the healthiest<br/>
ingredients for our bodies with the children is a great idea.  Trips to the<br/>
store do always include their choices but letting them help with the meal<br/>
planning and making a grocery list would be lots of fun and a great tool for<br/>
them.  Lately I&#39;ve been learning about safe alternative sweeteners and that<br/>
is certainly something they can help me with... taste tests and<br/>
experimenting is a fun idea!  My son loves to make charts and that would be<br/>
a fun way to use charts.  I have found myself making statements that are<br/>
simply not true and are scare tactics and I absolutely want to abolish that<br/>
behavior.  I&#39;ve gotten better but I need improvement.  Hopefully I&#39;ve not<br/>
ruined them for life!<br/>

&gt; I have 4 boys by birth.Â  They have always been allowed to eat whenever and whatever they want.Â  Food have not been an issue in our house.Â  Now that being said we adopted a little girl at the age of 8. She has suffered starvation and food restrictions.Â  Since she has been with us (two years)Â she has doubled her weight.Â  She is now 5&#39;2&quot; and weighs 170lbs.Â  I feel like I am hurting her by allowing her free reign over her intake.Â  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She is very sneaky with food.Â  She takes food or drinks from other people.Â Example: We went to the movies withÂ their Nana who bought drinks andÂ sweets and popcorn for everyone.Â  I looked overÂ and saw her drinking from her Nana&#39;s cup several times. ( I did not acknowledge this to her)Â Â Â If I get them something to share she gets extremely upset.Â Example: The other day we were out longer then I expected.Â  I only had enough money to buy 2 sub sandwiches from Subway.Â  There were 4 of us.Â  I offered this choice to everyone and they all agreed.Â  But then once inside when she really realized she was sharing ( I explained this in the car)Â she fell to pieces.Â  She refused to make any choices.Â  So I made the choices taking into consideration her likes and by the time we were in the car she was in tears.Â  I was not mean to her and I stayed calm.Â  She did eat herÂ half ofÂ the sandwich.Â  She has to control food for others too she will yell at our 5 year old for eating chips in the morning, I have always allowed chips in the morning.Â Â Â  We do not limit the kids candy after HalloweenÂ after a few days I have always put their left over candy into one bowl and that works for everyone except for her.Â  She will get upset so last year I kept her candy separate and combined the others and she ate theirs till it was gone before going to hers.Â  This created a situation where she had candy and no one else did.Â  She likes to hold it over their heads.Â Â This is the same for things like cereal too.Â  Everyone will choose a cereal and she will pick something noÂ one else likes and then will not even open it till all the otherÂ cereal is gone.Â  I have thoughts of only letting her eatÂ her choice but I think that is mean too.Â  I would really like to defuse this situations.Â  I am at a loss for what to do.Â  I know that she is picking up negative attitude from me in this regard and that I think isÂ due to the fact that IÂ feel I have to protect the boys fare share.Â  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My thinking was that given every opportunity to control her own intake some of these behaviors would subside.Â  The major improvement I have seen is she no longer eats till she throws up.Â Â  I would really like to hear what you all observe about this.Â  Perhaps I need an attitude adjustment or maybe this will take more time that I thought.Â  Has anyone else dealt with this type of behavior?Â  I do not want her to grow upÂ having food issues, and I especially do not want to beÂ a person in her life to addÂ or create food issues.Â  <br/>

&gt; -=-How long did it take your kids to eat &quot;real&quot; food?-=- <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thinking of some foods as &quot;real&quot; and others as any form of unreal is <br/>
&gt; going to be as much a problem as dividing the world into fun and <br/>
&gt; learning, as though they were separate things. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A point like that shouldn&#39;t crush the feelings of anyone old enough to <br/>
&gt; be a mother, or anyone bright enough to consider unschooling. A <br/>
&gt; point like that can, and will, and does regularly help someone make <br/>
&gt; another level toward &quot;beating the game&quot; of deschooling. It&#39;s not <br/>
&gt; easy for people to recover from ten or twenty years of schooling, but <br/>
&gt; people do it. They don&#39;t do it from being supported to stay where <br/>
&gt; they are and be satisfied with muddly thinking and negativity, though. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My children ate real food when they started nursing. They ate real <br/>
&gt; food when they tasted mashed foods off the ends of people&#39;s fingers, <br/>
&gt; or strained fruit. They ate real food when they tasted other people&#39;s <br/>
&gt; food when they were toddlers but weren&#39;t forced to taste it, nor <br/>
&gt; pressed to finish it. They have always eaten real food, their whole <br/>
&gt; lives. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Stories of hundreds of kids are here and at links from this: <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-774062947">-=- Thanks, though, for making me realize that<br/>
  someone I really looked up to prior to this is actually only looking  <br/>
for<br/>
  apostles to nod on cue.-=-<br/>
<br/>
While we&#39;re being analytical anyway, the first part is manipulative,  <br/>
and it&#39;s the kind of thinking that screws parents up in the area of  <br/>
seeing their kids clearly and lovingly.<br/>
<br/>
If a parent says &quot;I really loved you (to the child) until you (touched  <br/>
your weenie/told a fib/were gay).&quot;  It&#39;s &quot;I loved the image I had of  <br/>
you but now you&#39;ve strayed from it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And that person wasn&#39;t even my mom, and I didn&#39;t even fib, touch my  <br/>
weenie or be gay.<br/>
<br/>
So if I&#39;m only worthy of &quot;being looked up to&quot; when I fulfill the  <br/>
fantasy image each individual reader has of me, then there&#39;s no value  <br/>
in integrity or honesty.   But each person who decides what and whom  <br/>
to respect (look up to) or to consider sensible is deciding on his or  <br/>
her own.  It&#39;s a decision we each make.<br/>
<br/>
There are people in the world I think are awesome, and some I think  <br/>
are kooks.   My admiration of a person is non-transferable, though.   <br/>
Others will admire or not based on their own needs and values and  <br/>
individual principles.<br/>
<br/>
So that&#39;s about the first part.   It says more about the one who was  <br/>
looking up than the one who was looked up to, and it was an attempt  <br/>
(not conscious, but it&#39;s good to see what we&#39;re doing unconsciously,  <br/>
out of habit, too) to get me to back down, to apologize, to change in  <br/>
hopes that one person would continue to &quot;really look up to me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So the second part:<br/>
What on earth would I do with apostles nodding on cue!??  Seriously.   <br/>
What good does it do Keith or Marty or Kirby or Holly for people to  <br/>
&quot;nod&quot; at some great distance where I can&#39;t see them?  What good could  <br/>
it possibly do me!?    I&#39;m 	quite past the stage of finding my worth  <br/>
in the acceptance of the other teens.   Been there.  Lived through  <br/>
it.    And in my 20&#39;s and 30&#39;s, it was kinda nice to have people name  <br/>
me as someone who had helped organize an event, or someone who worked  <br/>
well with others on the job.  But even then I was starting to see that  <br/>
those were flashes in the pan of life, and not what made me reliable  <br/>
or &quot;nice.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If everyone on this list decided that enough unschooling words had  <br/>
flowed and they could go and just live their unschooling lives, and if  <br/>
every week ten or twelve people dropped off, instead of joined, I  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t cry myself to sleep even ONCE!  If I came in one day and I  <br/>
was the only one here, I&#39;d just think &quot;Cool!  Another project  <br/>
finished.&quot;   I&#39;d delete the list and go collect seeds in the yard, or  <br/>
go to a movie with Marty or bake a cake or something.  I really do  <br/>
have a life.  I had a big life before I had children, and I&#39;m sure  <br/>
I&#39;ll have a rich, full life when they&#39;ve all moved away.  I had  great  <br/>
unschooling discussions on bulletin boards online when I first got a  <br/>
*Prodigy e-mail account, and I&#39;ll probably keep up with my friends and  <br/>
kids online in whatever way is provided in ten or twenty years from  <br/>
now.  No one has ever been court-ordered to go on line and discuss  <br/>
unschooling.  Each person made a choice to join this list and makes a  <br/>
choice to read the posts or not.  Each person who writes a post has  <br/>
other choices right then:  Edit or not?  Send or not?  Follow up with  <br/>
a &quot;Sorry; what was I thinking!?&quot; or not?<br/>
<br/>
Life is about making choices.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1738107924">-=-Which goes back to my own childhood and issues around food and not  <br/>
learning about, and not being able to listen to my own body&#39;s cues  <br/>
because my own parents were quite sure they new what was best and  <br/>
healthiest for my body.=-<br/>
<br/>
I remember the school cafeteria and kids being made to eat canned  <br/>
spinach, and to drink all their milk, and to eat stewed plums and  <br/>
(because we were in New Mexico) enchiladas, which I thought were  <br/>
awesome, but any kids who were squeamish about ground beef or didn&#39;t  <br/>
do well with cheese or oil would&#39;ve been made ill.<br/>
<br/>
Someone was sure because a book said so that milk was crucial for  <br/>
children and there was no thought that some would gag and some would  <br/>
get the runs later, or that the stress of being pressed to choke down  <br/>
scary food or else they couldn&#39;t go out and play was NOT good for  <br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s only fairly recently that people stopped telling pregnant women  <br/>
that they had to drink milk so they could make milk.  How nonsensical  <br/>
is that!?  But because doctors and nurses were saying it, people took  <br/>
it as scientific fact.<br/>
