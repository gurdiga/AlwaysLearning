<div id="ygrps-yiv-1139675397">I don&#39;t usually handle the pending messages and approval of new members, but <br/>
I guess the one who does must have gone to do something exciting with her <br/>
family, and I just discovered a dozen pending messages.   No wonder this list was <br/>
so quiet!<br/>
<br/>
So at the risk of all kinds of stuff being out of order, here they&#39;ll come. <br/>
I&#39;m very sorry!!!<br/>
