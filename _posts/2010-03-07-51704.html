<br/>
My daughter is 6. She can read readers with 3-letter-words sentences.  She is interested in learning how to read more advanced books. <br/>

Any ideas on what to do?<br/>

Creatures) helped her immensely with reading. Find games your daugher  <br/>
loves to play, ones that feed into her interests.<br/>

Mud Washing Machine&quot; by Patty Wolcott. Little book, big words that are <br/>
repeated over and over in a very nice rhythm so kids can pick it up and <br/>
read it. She also wrote &quot;The Cake Book&quot; and &quot;My Shadow and I.&quot; She has <br/>
others - those three are the best.  They&#39;re old - try the library.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-459733963">Club penguin--a mostly-sweet online computer game with roly-poly penguin avatars.  Kids can play in one of two modes--type their responses (and heavily censored for language), or choose responses from drop down menus.  My daughter played this game long before she was a fluid reader.  She and her friends still play and she&#39;s 11.  You can dress your penguin, they get their own igloo that you can decorate, you can have puffles as pets, there are many games to play, and they have seasonal challenges and things.<br/>

If she is interested in things other than books, I know <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.starfall.com/">http://www.starfall.com/</a> has been fun for Margaux here and there over the last couple of years.  As far as books go, Margaux still really likes touch and feel books and lift the flap style books, those usually have limited words, but mostly more than 3 letter ones.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>i am not sure why but my middle son really liked Dick and Jane books.  My mother had bought us one cause she thought I could use it to teach my oldest one to read.  I just left it lying around and my middle son found it one day and asked to read it.  He went through the whole thick book in a couple weeks and was off and reading.  I think it gave him confidence.  He has never been one for sounding things out though.  <br/>
a friend of mines son expressed and interest in reading last year so i let him borrow it. he was so excited and did the same thing.  <br/>
that being said, my 8 year old never had any interest in reading anything that inane.</div>

The Dr. Seuss Bright and Early books like Great Day for Up might be a good next step, or they might be where you are already. Anything repetitive is good for kids wanting to start tackling longer words, like books where the story is a song, If You Give A Mouse a Cookie, stuff with a The House That Jack Built pattern, the one Pam suggested, etc. If she has any particular interests you can email me off list and I might have some ideas. I worked in a children&#39;s bookstore for the last couple years before having my kiddo.<br/>
