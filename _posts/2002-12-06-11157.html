<div id="ygrps-yiv-1970097370">I&#39;m passing this along because Harry Potter seems such a polarizing topic <br/>
within some homeschooling communities (even one of Holly&#39;s best homeschooling <br/>
friends is from an anti-Potter home), I thought you&#39;d like to know some news, <br/>
perhaps even ahead of your Potter-fearful associates.<br/>
<br/>

Here is a great offer for you from Bright Media Foundation -<br/>

<br/>
A lonely orphan is caught up in an epic battle of good and <br/>
<br/>
evil in the legendary land of Withershins.  Come with <br/>
<br/>
Jotham on a journey of suspense, intrigue and faith, as he <br/>
<br/>
and his friends, Alfric and Gwyneth, battle dark forces <br/>
<br/>
far beyond their understanding in a quest to fulfill their <br/>
<br/>
deepest hearts&#39; desires.  It&#39;s a gripping fantasy infused <br/>
<br/>
with ageless values of grace, hope, forgiveness...and love!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why settle for merely &quot;living the magic&quot; when you can have <br/>
<br/>
the love of the King?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
In this allegorical tale, authors Bill Bright and <br/>
<br/>
M.R. Wells take you to another place and time ... a world <br/>
<br/>
in conflict where evil forces wield dark powers, and a <br/>
<br/>
snow-white dove carries the indescribable and mysterious <br/>
<br/>
truth of Prince Morning Star. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Like the works of J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis, the novels<br/>
<br/>
in &quot;The Legend of Withershins&quot; series are destined to <br/>
<br/>
become Christian classics.  A Child of the King is the <br/>
<br/>
first book in this series, and it&#39;s available now at your <br/>
<br/>
favorite Christian bookstore!  <br/>

<br/>
and adoption will touch your heart and speak toook <br/>

<br/>
truths explained in greater detail by Bill Bright in <br/>
<br/>
Living Supernaturally in Christ.  Check it out when you <br/>
