<div id="ygrps-yiv-1159693378">We judge ourselves by what we feel capable of doing, while others  <br/>
judge us by what we have already done. -Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,  <br/>
poet (1807-1882)<br/>
<br/>
It made me think of how a child will view how his joyful days are  <br/>
flowing and a still deschooling parent will be looking for proof that  <br/>
something, anything that resembles learning is happening.<br/>
<br/>
