<div id="ygrps-yiv-2011742832">OOH! I have one!<br/>
AAA members can get those free tour books for various states or regions. We<br/>
ordered some off the internet for our trip to NM and also the DC region<br/>
where we live now. It is full of all KINDS of fun things to do. We joined<br/>
AAA with those mailer specials and it is really worth it.<br/>
DigitalCity has some great ideas for various areas.<br/>
I bet if you search Google for &lt;tourist kids yourcityhere&gt; or something<br/>
similar you&#39;ll find loads of fun stuff.<br/>
My favorite magazines for fun stuff is Family Fun Magazine.<br/>
 www.FamilyFun.com )<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think I have the opposite problem. Threre are so many cool things out<br/>
there that I want to do, both by myself and with Cacie, and there just<br/>
aren&#39;t enough hours in the day. Right now, we&#39;re trying to fit in trips<br/>
to Phoenix (including the Forbidden City exhibit and the science center,<br/>
and Karin :-) , Tombstone and Bisbee, Madeira Canyon, Colossal Cave,<br/>
Karchner Cavern, the bowling alley, the Desert Museum again, Puerto<br/>
Penasco again, the Gem and Mineral Show... plus there are zillions of<br/>
things we want to do and make, scince projects, art projects... and games<br/>
to play, and books to read, both aloud and to ourselves. Maybe you could<br/>
start checking out the local newspaper, the daily or the wekly freebies,<br/>
and just see what&#39;s up right now. Or you could check with the state or<br/>
regional parks district and see what they&#39;re up to, or the local museums,<br/>
or the tv guide,  and just see what sounds cool to at least one of you.<br/>
Then you can call around and make plans, maybe aim for one thing a week?<br/>
