I was about to send this back to the poster as being inappropriate  <br/>
for the list, but I let it through.  This isn&#39;t a recommendation on  <br/>
my part for people to go to that site, but for those with extra time  <br/>
and curiosity, it might interesting to see  how it holds up against  <br/>
the ideals and principles of unschooling, or the opportunities  <br/>
unschoolers have.<br/>

As far as the feeleez go, nothing like that would&#39;ve helped my non-<br/>
empathic child be more empathic sooner or better.  We have some of <br/>
those puzzles that swap out faces of different emotions, but she&#39;s <br/>
never used it for the purpose of being more empathic.  I guess she <br/>
used it for acting out some emotions here and there with some made up <br/>
stories to go along with the different faces.  The only thing that&#39;s <br/>
really helped is trial and error in real life applications.<br/>
<br/>
The art is cute and I think Margaux would&#39;ve like them just because <br/>
of that and the goofy faces and such.  I&#39;m not so sure about the <br/>
justification of using them as teaching tools.  However, I can see <br/>
how they&#39;d be useful in child therapy situations.<br/>
<br/>
I guess, mostly, I get kind of weird about &quot;teaching tools&quot; and all <br/>
the lingo and such that go along with it.  It smacks of preschool and <br/>
school stuff, and I find we do so much better without that stuff in <br/>
our life.  It&#39;s kind of life how I feel about the leapfrog stuff, <br/>
it&#39;s fun and kinda cool, just soooo teacherly.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1271085292">Something that bothers me is that you don&#39;t know WHO you will be consulting with.<br/>
There is nothing I could find about who they or he/she is.<br/>
Not that I want to consult with anyone but I have called  Schuyler and Kelly for help.<br/>
I know who they are!<br/>
