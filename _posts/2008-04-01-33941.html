<div id="ygrps-yiv-1757499477">What a strange experience we had today at the pool.  I haven&#39;t had a  <br/>
chance to sit down and right about it until now.  We went to the Y to  <br/>
go swimming.  Earlier this morning, we knew that&#39;s what we all wanted  <br/>
to do this afternoon.  I looked up the Y&#39;s schedule and noticed that  <br/>
there was a &quot;homeschool&quot; time around the same time we were going to  <br/>
be there and I thought, &quot;cool, maybe we can find some kids to play  <br/>
with&quot;.  Well we got there about 45 minutes before the homeschoolers  <br/>
&quot;PE&quot; (that is what is was listed as) was about to start and just  <br/>
played and swam and played and swam.  At the appointed time, all of  <br/>
the sudden, there were 40-50 kids marched into the pool by a couple  <br/>
of Y employees barking out orders at them.  The kids seemed to range  <br/>
in age from about 5-10 years old.  My kids got a little scared of all  <br/>
of the commotion and went and got in the kiddie pool to play around.   <br/>
Everytime one of the lifeguards yelled out, my kids jumped.  They  <br/>
were yelling things like, &quot;sit down on the white line, I said sit  <br/>
down, you may not get up yet&quot; &quot;you have to have your hand marked if  <br/>
you haven&#39;t taken the swimming test&quot;  &quot;If you wipe the mark off your  <br/>
hand then you will just have to wear a float belt&quot;.  This went on for  <br/>
30 minutes!  After they had barked out all of the rules once again to  <br/>
all of the kids, they were allowed to get in.  Now I had been waiting  <br/>
for this moment.  I couldn&#39;t wait to see what kinds of neat things  <br/>
they did with the kids for &quot;homeschooling PE&quot;.  Nothing, that is what  <br/>
they did.  The kids just swam and played like any kids swim and play  <br/>
in a pool.  My kids were a bit overwhelmed and I think were afraid of  <br/>
getting into trouble with the barking lifeguards, who up until this  <br/>
point had been really nice.  I was happy for them to be doing  <br/>
whatever they wanted to do which was play in the kiddie pool, so I  <br/>
just sat and observed the lifeguards, the children and their  <br/>
interactions with each other.<br/>
<br/>
At one point, 20 minutes after they had been in the water, a whistle  <br/>
was blown and they all got out.  First thing I thought was &quot;that&#39;s  <br/>
it???&quot;  But they all had to rush out and come and sit on the white  <br/>
line again and line up with their buddy.  They were reprimanded for  <br/>
it taking them so long to get out and on the white line.  &quot;we will do  <br/>
this one more time and if you aren&#39;t all out in 1 minute and on the  <br/>
white line with a buddy, then we will do a buddy check every five  <br/>
minutes until you can get it right!&quot;  And then they were all allowed  <br/>
back in the water to play.  This of course was simply a threat  <br/>
because they never once called them out again until the end.  So for  <br/>
a 90 minute PE, they spent 30 minutes in the beginning getting  <br/>
organized and barked at then only 45 minutes swimming (with buddy  <br/>
checks) and 15 minutes getting out and organized to leave and barked  <br/>
at about there not being time today for showers and they better hurry  <br/>
up and get dressed and no playing around.<br/>
<br/>
And the really interesting thing????  I never saw another parent!   <br/>
Witnessing the whole thing was just very strange for me and I think  <br/>
for my kids too.  As soon as all those kids were gone, mine just  <br/>
jumped right back in the big pool and started swimming there.<br/>
<br/>
I went back in my journal and found an entry I made after a similar  <br/>
pool experience this last fall:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We are at a very crowded YMCA pool tonight. It is full of working  <br/>
parents trying to cram in the kids&#39; swimming lesson into today&#39;s to- <br/>
do list. You know when my kids learned to swim? When I stopped taking  <br/>
them to swimming lessons. We just spent almost everyday one summer  <br/>
letting them, allowing them, to explore their bodies and abilities at  <br/>
the pool. Like any good mother, I had them in the water and in  <br/>
swimming lessons before they were even walking. I myself used to even  <br/>
teach swimming lessons. I spun my kids in circles and sand silly  <br/>
songs much like the weary-eyed parents here tonight. Now that I have  <br/>
some objectivity, I sit here and think &quot;do they realize how silly  <br/>
what they are doing is?&quot; Do we need to pay money and be on a class  <br/>
schedule in order to play with our kids in the pool? Swimming comes  <br/>
naturally to kids when they are exposed to it in a way that doesn&#39;t  <br/>
induce fear. I have a vivid childhood memory of being with my crying  <br/>
brother while he was left in a swimming lesson. My mom was told that  <br/>
the kids do better when the parents leave. But why the need for  <br/>
structured learning of something that comes so naturally? I didn&#39;t  <br/>
have to sign my kids up for crawling classes or walking classes.  <br/>
Don&#39;t get me wrong; I think kids should be in the water young and  <br/>
often. From my own teaching experience, it can be very difficult to  <br/>
teach an afraid adult to swim. So I guess my question is, why do we,  <br/>
as parents, have this need for swimming lessons? Because it is our  <br/>
need. The kid&#39;s don&#39;t want it. They just need lots of time in the  <br/>
water. Is it our need for accomplishment or the illusion of it  <br/>
through classes (&quot;Johnny has just moved up to Minnow&quot;)? Do we do it  <br/>
because it is what we are &quot;supposed&quot; to be doing with out kids. All I  <br/>
know for sure is that my kids are all swimming like fish tonight,  <br/>
lost in their imaginary world of mermaids and mer-men, while at the  <br/>
other end of the pool some small child may be thinking, &quot;why is my  <br/>
mom singing that stupid song and when will I be able to just play?&quot;  <br/>
And the mom might be thinking, &quot;why am I singing this stupid song and  <br/>
when will we ever get a minute in our hectic schedules to just play?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Blessings,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1552567219">Well, I think I started with swim lessons because I wanted my <br/>
daughter to learn to swim as soon as possible so we could just get in <br/>
the pool and swim in the summer time and she&#39;d know how to do it and <br/>
have swimming behind her. A friend told me about a school where all <br/>
her kids learned how to swim in three weeks. <br/>
<br/>
Generally, I thought they did pretty well with the kids. However, my <br/>
daughter did cry a lot about going under water. The teacher she <br/>
changed to after the first session (the first three weeks)is kind of <br/>
a &quot;firm disciplinarian.&quot; My daughter actually did better after a <br/>
while but still cried at times. After a day of quite a bit of crying <br/>
and after I&#39;d been learning about unschooling for a while, I started <br/>
asking her if she liked swim lessons and wanted to go. She kept <br/>
saying yes. I took her back. For a while after that, she didn&#39;t cry <br/>
at all and was very heppy through lessons. Many sessions later, she <br/>
still doesn&#39;t know how to swim yet.<br/>
<br/>
After a particularly rough day, she was crying a lot. She had <br/>
switched teachers during the second half. The teacher got annoyed by <br/>
the crying and said something to her regular teacher. My daughter <br/>
climbed out of the pool and was sobbing. I went to pick her up, and <br/>
her regular teacher came over and said, &quot;Stop crying!&quot; I was just <br/>
about to leave with her and didn&#39;t see any need for that. As soon as <br/>
I picked her up, she calmed down. I started asking her again if she <br/>
wanted lessons. I told her I didn&#39;t like them telling her to stop <br/>
crying, and I thought it was mean. I asked her before her next lesson <br/>
if she wanted to go. She said no. The next lesson she said yes and <br/>
then no. I told her we could go swim at her aunt&#39;s house, and she <br/>
wanted to do that.<br/>
<br/>
As we played together in the water, she was ecstatic. She only cried <br/>
when it was time to get out. She didn&#39;t want to stop. I was euphoric <br/>
seeing her joy as she played and clung to me in the water as much as <br/>
she wanted. I felt such a burden lifted from my shoulders. I called <br/>
the swim school to tell them we weren&#39;t coming for lessons any more. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to unschooling!!<br/>

Very, very cool.<br/>
<br/>
Keith swims well.  He can do a few fancy dives.  I don&#39;t swim at  <br/>
all.  Still, he didn&#39;t take the kids to swim lessons; he wanted me  <br/>
to.  I didn&#39;t want them to get my fears.   It worked out, and he has  <br/>
done a lot of playing in pools with them, and in a lake with Marty  <br/>
and Holly.   (Kirby and I opted out of that family trip, where Marty  <br/>
rode a Jet Ski and Holly and Marty towed a houseboat (themselves, for  <br/>
fun).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-830533476">Holly did take swimming lessons, but not really.  I found this this  <br/>
morning, looking for something else (and THAT is really how  <br/>
unschooling can work, with people being willing to find something  <br/>
other than what they were looking for, and make good use of it!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
**********************<br/>
Out front there are bikes, a pogo stick, a pogo-ball thing, lots of  <br/>
rollerblades, a skateboard, a &quot;taxi bike&quot; (a tricycle with another  <br/>
seat behind), and those are used in waves, and left alone in waves.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby takes karate three times a week.<br/>
<br/>
Marty skates on Saturdays. He&#39;s up to Basic IV and will start hockey  <br/>
in April, I think. Holly skates too, unfortunately not at the same  <br/>
time. She&#39;s in Basic I, having finished a little-kid Snowplow Sam class.<br/>
<br/>
All three kids are in swimming lessons three days a week.<br/>
<br/>
We have a compost pile, and it&#39;s kind of amazing how it seems at  <br/>
first that the food and leaves and sticks and banana peels and dog  <br/>
poop will never do anything but sit there looking like garbage, but  <br/>
when I stop watching it, it turns to solid black, rich dirt! I can&#39;t  <br/>
find any parts of the elements of which it&#39;s made. It&#39;s kind of like  <br/>
that with my kids. It took me a few years to quit watching them and  <br/>
trust that it would compost. ￼<br/>
It did.<br/>
<br/>
***************************************<br/>
<br/>
  Holly was too short to stand in the water, and so she could only do  <br/>
the stuff on the top steps, and so she would sit with me and my  <br/>
friend Monica Cordova, whose two older kids were in the class too.   <br/>
When I read that, which was written while we were still at our old  <br/>
house, it all came back.  We were at the indoor pool at Los Altos  <br/>
Park, and after that there was an outdoor pool near Comanche, and  <br/>
Holly just opted out totally and hung out with me instead.  And  <br/>
ultimately she became a better swimmer.  But she was in lessons a  <br/>
little while, and didn&#39;t finish a course.<br/>
