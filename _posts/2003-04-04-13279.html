<div id="ygrps-yiv-1136299688">We got this cool book, BattleBots: The Official Guide, by Mark Clarkson<br/>
, at the library. It&#39;s VERY funny, profiles the bots and the people, and how <br/>
to, and all that...and the author unschools with his family! His website is <br/>
MarkClarkson.com.<br/>
