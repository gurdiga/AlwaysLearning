<div id="ygrps-yiv-209859334">Hey everyone-<br/>
<br/>
 I recently rented the movie &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot;, and I thought it<br/>
was AWESOME, and a great family movie as well. One thing that stuck<br/>
out to me especially was the way the two kids and their dad played,<br/>
explored outside and really loved each other. Not your typical &#39;disney<br/>
movie&#39;! It&#39;s definately on my favorites list. :)</div>

<br/>
It&#39;s a Hayao Miyazaki movie. He&#39;s the most popular movie director in  <br/>
Japan.<br/>
<br/>
Disney has the rights to subtitle and dub and distribute many of his  <br/>
movies. I read that the deal includes that they can&#39;t change any of  <br/>
the dialog, that the translations need to be as close to what was  <br/>
originally said as possible. (For those familiar with the Fox dub,  <br/>
there are some differences in the new Disney release.)<br/>

<br/>
(You can get complete scripts of his movies there.)<br/>
<br/>
Another unschooly movie of his is Kiki&#39;s Delivery Service.<br/>
<br/>
Some others:<br/>
<br/>
Howl&#39;s Moving Castle (just released 2 weeks ago, based on Dianna Wynn  <br/>
Jones book)<br/>
Spirited Away<br/>
Princess Mononoke (more mature theme, you may want to read about it  <br/>
at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.screenit.com">http://www.screenit.com</a> before showing it to younger kids)<br/>
Castle in the Sky<br/>
Castle of Caliostro (a Lupin III movie)<br/>
<br/>
Apparently the next one coming out in Japan in July -- directed by  <br/>
his son -- is Tales from Earthsea, based on Ursula K. LeGuin&#39;s  <br/>
Earthsea trilogy.<br/>

 <br/>
<br/>
I knew it was Miyazaki, (I had become a fan after watching Spirited Away and decided to watch all of his movies!) But I meant it wasn&#39;t a &quot;Disney-ish&quot; family movie with evil villains and dead parents. :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going out to buy the movie today!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-552118423">They are playing a month of Hayao Miyazaki movie on carton net work. It&#39;s really just  4 of his movies I think On Saturday around 7:30, 8 pm eastern time. <br/>
<br/>
The latest one that was released was really really good &quot;Howl&#39;s Moving Castle&quot;  Princess Mononoke does have a more mature theme but my son seemed to pick up on the deep more spiritual meaning of the movie.  The same with Spirited Away.  I love how my son interprets the values and morals very enlightening. We love all of Hayao Miyazaki  movies. <br/>
<br/>
It was just recently that we learned about Japanese animation and it was another one of those things that was hard for me to appreciate and I wasn&#39;t too sure about letting my son watch them. I didn&#39;t understand them. My son got the meanings right way, where as it took me a few more time of watching to appreciate them. I guess I wasn&#39;t watching with a open mind.   My son teaches me more then I teach him when I let him. He&#39;s way more open minded then I am. But I&#39;m working hard at fixing that problem in my self.  Thanks for the links. T<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-943448448">In Tokyo, there is a Miyazaki museum.  They have a huge replica of the<br/>
Totoro bus, that is all fuzzy, and kids can get inside-- then it rumbles<br/>
around and plays the music from the movie!  (It doesn&#39;t actually *go*<br/>
anywhere, just rumbles on its &quot;legs&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
We have not been yet, but hope to go before we leave Japan.  My neighbor<br/>
grew up in Tokyo, and has told me all about it.  Her cell phone rings the<br/>
song from Totoro!<br/>
<br/>
She also told me that on the Fox version, at least, the woman who does<br/>
Satsuki&#39;s voice is the same woman who does it in Japanese.<br/>

(but not directed) by Hayao Miyazaki.  It was another wonderful story, w/<br/>
great animation.<br/>
