<div id="ygrps-yiv-313847614">The best way to pick up a foreign language is to hang out with native<br/>
speakers.  I did my best while volunteering to help Mexican immigrants learn<br/>
English.  It was a two-way street which helped to build some nice<br/>
relationships as well.<br/>
<br/>
Your son is still quite young.  What about contacting a consulate or<br/>
immigrant relocation service (we use our next door neighbors who usually<br/>
have a few illegals staying with them) to make contact with Spanish speaking<br/>
moms. Play dates where everyone is working to communicate together might be<br/>
beneficial for all.<br/>

Japanese I wrote to the Japanese Consulate in Seattle and asked them if<br/>
they could send us information on Japan.  We got such a huge amount of<br/>
stuff.  Magazines, one copy in English one in Japanese, maps, a cd, all<br/>
kinds of things.  They also have a lending library of everything you can<br/>
imagine.  They lone books, videos, cds, for free, you just pay postage.  <br/>

We also met a Japanese mom and daughter on another unschooling list and<br/>
have been corresponding with them.  She sent Dylan a comic book he likes<br/>
in Japanese and we have the English version and that&#39;s been very fun to<br/>
try to figure out.   <br/>

figured it out yet.<br/>

address.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
www.sre.gob.mx/seattle/index.htm   ( could be a porn site too, I&#39;m not<br/>
sure )<br/>
<br/>
I found a &#39;phone number for the Spanish Consulate somewhere in CA and<br/>
it&#39;s <br/>
213-938-0158<br/>
<br/>
If none of this works, just try a google search or try the State<br/>
Department, they will have a list of all the Consulates in the US.<br/>
