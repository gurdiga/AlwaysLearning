<div id="ygrps-yiv-2116697309">There is a July 20 blog post by a mom named Sarah, who has written  <br/>
about how a day was changed, by the way a life is being changed. She  <br/>
writing about seeing choices.  I don&#39;t want to give away the joy and  <br/>
the details, but it&#39;s very nicely written and was wonderfully done.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m going to reveal part (not all) of the ending, just in case someone  <br/>
is wondering whether it&#39;s worth reading.  Looking back on the day  <br/>
she&#39;s described, she wrote:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If I&#39;d stayed on my path that I started on, my kids would have felt  <br/>
like a bother, a pain, a grudging responsibility. One of them for sure  <br/>
would have felt unloved. Another would have closed me out. The other  <br/>
two would have just gotten crankier and crankier as the emotional  <br/>
undercurrent they didn&#39;t understand got yuckier. Instead, every one of  <br/>
my kids went to sleep feeling loved and like they&#39;d lived the day all  <br/>
the way through.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad Sarah has written and shared that.<br/>
