<div id="ygrps-yiv-1027915533">Although they&#39;ve become more expensive over the years and I&#39;m not  <br/>
doing a fullout mailing of Christmas cards this time, I wanted to  <br/>
appeal (beg, hint) that I just LOVE cards and if any of you are  <br/>
sending cards, or sent some and have one leftover, just sitting  <br/>
there,  my address is&#92;<br/>
2905 Tahiti Court NE<br/>
Albuquerque NM  87112<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll put them up on the wall and be thrilled every day.<br/>
<br/>
I have saved all the cards I&#39;ve gotten for the past 20 years or more,  <br/>
and I look at them sometimes, and someday maybe I&#39;ll so something cool  <br/>
with my collection.<br/>
<br/>
I admire and share and re-read and save every card, so think of me if  <br/>
you&#39;re in card-processing mode, please!<br/>
<br/>
