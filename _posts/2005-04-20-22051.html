<br/>
I&#39;ve offerred to hold an hour long funshop on Letterboxing in <br/>
conjunction with James&#39;s funshop on geocaching.  So, putting us back to <br/>
back early in the conference would probably be ideal so folks can have a <br/>
chance to look for the letterbox throughout the conference.<br/>
<br/>
Letterbox Funshop: Great for families and young children, letterboxing <br/>
is an outdoor treasure-hunt adventure with a creative twist in its <br/>
hand-carved stamps. Begun in Dartmoor, England, in 1854, letterboxing <br/>
has evolved into part hike, part puzzle, part art. Popularized in <br/>
America by a 1998 _Smithsonian_ article, North American Letterboxing has <br/>
grown over the past decade and a half to an estimated 5000 boxes <br/>
scattered across the country. We&#39;ll talk about the history and ethics of <br/>
letterboxing, box placement, stamp and clue design, and how to get <br/>
started this weekend with our very own Live and Learn St. Louis letterbox!<br/>
<br/>
Do you need the bio and picture stuff from me again? Would you like a <br/>
different bio that focuses more on our letterbox stuff with links, etc.?<br/>
<br/>
Also, you expressed interest in having me conduct a web-based <br/>
documentation funshop, which would probably also be an hour. Are you <br/>
still interested in having me do that? If so, I&#39;ll work up a quick <br/>
description.<br/>
