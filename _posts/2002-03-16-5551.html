So sorry. :-/<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;These e-mails take on a life of their own.  The PBS one that just<br/>
&gt;passed through the group was several years old and the people<br/>
&gt;who started it have been trying to stop it almost from the very<br/>
&gt;beginning.  I humbly recommend not responding.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There are already many case studies that show that internet chain<br/>
&gt;letters create a very-difficult-to-stop, often exponentially growing,<br/>
&gt;generally overwhelming response.  Besides Hotmail being very<br/>
&gt;inconvenienced by the traffic, Mrs. Lenz could find herself named<br/>
&gt;in a lawsuit as a result of violating the agreement with them<br/>
&gt;forbidding chain letters - if there are damages.  In fact, these days, <br/>
&gt;internet DOS or &quot;denial of service&quot; attacks can be considered<br/>
&gt;information warfare, aka terrorism.<br/>
