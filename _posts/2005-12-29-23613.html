I&#39;ve  never had experiences that you are stating, because once my kids turn   <br/>
18 they receive their lump sum money from their dad and me, and then they  <br/>
are  <br/>
responsible for what happens in their lives.  I have tried  to help prepare  <br/>
them for this for their whole life.  But I do  know that they all work into  <br/>
the <br/>
idea that they want to be &quot;adult&quot;  as far as the privileges, but aren&#39;t as  <br/>
willing to realize the  responsibilities that go along with that.  I feel it  <br/>
is <br/>
my duty  as a parent to help them learn that ----- <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*******Oh, no, it isn&#39;t nearly as drastic as it sounded in the  e-mail.  The <br/>
way it goes is that at 18 we no longer give them their  clothing allowance or <br/>
personal allowance.  They are &quot;free&quot; to live at home  as long as they care to <br/>
-  that has ranged from 1 to 3 years and still  counting - so far. (We do <br/>
charge rent, based on their earnings, to  teach them the reality - a bit anyway- <br/>
of what it costs to live and  eat). What I meant was that the decisions of - <br/>
will I work, will I go to  school, will I buy a car, etc, become theirs ( we <br/>
offer info and advice ).   By no means are they abandoned, but they have been <br/>
setting up their  savings/checking acct for a few years, have had jobs of various <br/>
types, and  usually taken some college classes by then. <br/>
 <br/>
They are always welcome to come home if they need to - only Shawn did once  <br/>
for a summer job in his transfer from PA back to CA and then grad school.<br/>
 <br/>
My intended meaning, was that being grown up and making grown up decisions  <br/>
can be VERY difficult.  We as parents are the safety net.  BUT -- with  help, <br/>
the kids need to move into the world ( at their own speed) but we  encourage <br/>
them to go -- they get cranky and restless just milling around at home  -- well, <br/>
actually, I guess by 18 they were all involved in someway in going on  into <br/>
the big world.<br/>
 <br/>
It was interesting to experience the idea of being a strict parent in  <br/>
reading the e-mail - I&#39;m usually perceived as pretty easy and  accommodating!!  :-)<br/>
 <br/>
I hope this makes my statements clearer.<br/>

Before they&#39;re 18, they couldn&#39;t work?  You wouldn&#39;t let them go to  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1332067398">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I am returning to this group after quite a long break as lists in general became overwhelming and I had to live life but I have regularly connected to Sandra&#39;s web page on unschooling.  We have a relaxed run unschooling household for the past nine years but I have come up against a problem I am not sure how to address.  <br/>
<br/>
Our daughter is 16 going on 17 - By way of background our country has a standard for admitting people under twenty to university (your equivalent of college) and in a nutshell it requires &quot;school&quot; credits from a fairly limited selection of prescribed subjects or you can take a gamble that they will accept you with some kind of equivalent status but no guarantees in advance.  As there is only a once a year opportunity to sit the &quot;school&quot; exams you have to wait another year if your alternative proves unsuccessful. Dd is a keen writer and at this point thinks she may wish to pursue a career in communications supported by a university degree and work on her novel in her spare time.<br/>
 <br/>
The University Entrance process is essentially a two step process unless you do math all the way through. Some credits in math are compulsory.  To complicate matters to get enough credits you need some credits which are internally assessed so you can&#39;t just work through things at home at your own pace as you need a school to &quot;assess&quot; work.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t really feel like a radical unschooler but the messages I am getting from dd is that I have instilled unschooling values.  She hated having to hook into the school system.  She felt the structure was awful, the correspondence booklets useless and the work pointless.  I can understand her point of view. I tried to gently modify as much as possible but she was left feeling afraid she would not pass the courses if she did not do it the school way.  The upshot has been a pretty miserable year all round.  I am not sure how much of this is just being 16 going on 17 and how much is the school stuff.  We are now faced with choices for 2009 and at present we have a reluctant acceptance of more &#39;school&quot; stuff but the prospect breaks my heart.  There have been many tears shed and I am looking for encouragement and advice on going forward.<br/>
<br/>
Dd does not want to take a gamble on submitting an unschooling transcript along with some credits from the system (which are not the ones specified) and I respect that but I don&#39;t really want to endure another year like 2008 either.  Suggestions???  How do I walk beside my teen through these difficulties or are they not in fact difficulties.<br/>

It seems she can either write up a glowing unschooling application  <br/>
requesting an exemption from the rules for being wonderfully special,  <br/>
or she can take some classes to get the credits.<br/>
<br/>
Neither of those seems horrible.  If she wants to be a plumber or a  <br/>
pilot, there will be classes and tests.<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t get into a teen-angst boat and say &quot;I&#39;ll go wherever you  <br/>
go,&quot; though.  I would stay in solid-land, point out the options, find  <br/>
other things exciting and interesting in the world to keep ALL her  <br/>
moments from being about school-or-not-school, and tell her I&#39;d help  <br/>
her with a transcript or with getting into classes, if that&#39;s what  <br/>
she wanted.<br/>

That, maybe, although your daughter would be the school and the child  <br/>
both.  If it&#39;s not your choice to press school, you shouldn&#39;t have to  <br/>
suffer the mother-of-school-child pressures.   Find some honest,  <br/>
clear options for her, present them to her, and then don&#39;t live  <br/>
between her and the choice.  It&#39;s an adult version of &quot;Do you want to  <br/>
wear the pink coat or the black one?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(I haven&#39;t read other responses, and maybe other people had softer,  <br/>
more gentle suggestions.)<br/>

If I were in the same situation, I would lay out all the choices, let<br/>
her choose, and help her honor her choices.  She may already have an<br/>
idea of what she wants to do.  I wouldn&#39;t commiserate with her if her<br/>
choice goes wrong somewhere along the way.  Sometimes, in the middle of<br/>
all the hard stuff, people can feel stuck and unsure about how to get<br/>
out or that there is even an out, still there.  Help her remember why<br/>
she chose the way she did and help her to see that it can still be a<br/>
good one.  Since it indirectly involves you, you can be the guide, to<br/>
keep pointing, and the cheering squad, and the meal maker and area<br/>
cleaner, and shuttle runner, and errand maker, all to help things go<br/>
smoother.<br/>
<br/>
While she&#39;s doing the mandatory stuff, can she take a writing course of<br/>
some sort?  I know, when I was in college, I never would&#39;ve lasted if I<br/>
wasn&#39;t able to take classes that I really wanted beside the mandatory<br/>
ones, actually that was true for highschool as well.<br/>
<br/>
All the required work to be done, can be done with your help, she<br/>
doesn&#39;t have to go it alone.  Help her be successful in her decision.</div>

 </span></blockquote>I picked this out, because I wonder if there is an alternative to her  <br/>
going to university *right now*? If she can be admitted as a &quot;mature  <br/>
student&quot; at 20, are there jobs or volunteer work she can do to put on  <br/>
her resume until then?<br/>
<br/>
The hoops for a mature student are not the same as for kids coming out  <br/>
of high school. It might be worth exploring.<br/>
<br/>
Does New Zealand have the equivalent of community college classes that  <br/>
she could attend in the meantime? Sometimes, classes are transferable  <br/>
to a university program.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-99274051">Thank you Sandra, Jenny and Robyn for you input. You have all in different ways reinforced the postion I was coming through myself.  Robyn, I have suggested the community college option - she could do a course in journalism for six months in a class of 15, probably have quite a lot of fun, get some credits which the university will look at but will not at this stage confirm they will accept.  It looked quite a good option to me but doesn&#39;t suit dd&#39;s need for certainty  <br/>
<br/>
So at this stage we are tentaively enrolled in  Correpondence Courses for Englsih, History and Music.  I have a feeling that the deletion of math wil make a much bigger difference than dd expects.  It was definitely a chore and a bore. I am also planning to get a tutor maybe once a week or once a fortnight to come in so she can bounce some ideas off someone different. She will still have her music, singing, drama and karate to keep her in touch with the real world so here&#39;s hoping it will all work out a bit happier than this year.<br/>
<br/>
Jenny I will try to help her remember why<br/>
she chose the way she did and help her to see that it can still be a<br/>
good one.I have quite a lot of experience in the  being  the guide, to<br/>
 and the cheering squad, and the meal maker and area<br/>
cleaner, and shuttle runner, and errand maker, all to help things go<br/>
smoother. I just need to learn the chill through the angst bit.<br/>
<br/>
On reflection I maybe gave her the opportunity to explore too many choices and she has felt a bit scared and overwhelmed by it all.  Now the enrolment stuff has been accepted for the correspondence courses she seems back on a more even keel.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to you all,<br/>

<br/>
I will try to explain - the analogy that comes to mind is that I want to be thin but I don&#39;t want to diet. Dd wants to go to university and study writng but to do that she either has to wait until she is 20 which she is not inclined to do or as Sandra has said she can take some classes to get the credits. Getting the credits to date has been all hard slog.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra suggested :<br/>

I can live with that but teens can be inclined to blame their parent for choices they are not happy with and spend hours glowering. Maybe I do just need to disengage. I will mull on that.<br/>

I&#39;m just sensing that you&#39;re maybe not making it easier for her by  <br/>
maybe taking on the angst and stress that really ought to be hers, not  <br/>

can help her let go of the stress more - maybe you&#39;re sort of adding  <br/>
to it instead of being the calming influence that helps her settle  <br/>
down and be comfortable with her own choice.<br/>
<br/>
As a mom to three young women who are VERY intense - high energy,  <br/>
emotional types - I have had to learn to do this over and over.  <br/>
Sometimes it means leaving the room, getting out of earshot, when they  <br/>
are vocalizing their frustration or misery. Roxana, for example, is  <br/>
taking an algebra class. She doesn&#39;t care much for it - actually, she  <br/>
sort of likes the math but the teacher is way over the edge of  <br/>
ridiculous in her demands for homework and tests being formatted  <br/>
exactly her way. So, Rox will be doing homework and start getting  <br/>
cranky and irritated and start moaning and groaning out loud. I might  <br/>
make a couple of sympathetic sounds, and I&#39;ll certainly sharpen her  <br/>
broken pencil and bring her a cup of tea, but I don&#39;t let myself get  <br/>
hooked so much that I&#39;m also experiencing her frustration. Sometimes I  <br/>
have to leave the room, get out of earshot, to keep from being sucked  <br/>
in. When I talk to her, at times like that, I am careful to keep my  <br/>
voice sympathetic, but also relaxed and confident that she can handle  <br/>
it. I might say, &quot;Yeah, frustrating, huh?&quot; But not much more than that.<br/>
<br/>
I still don&#39;t think we&#39;ve got the complete picture of what&#39;s going on  <br/>
with you and your daughter. You said; &quot;I can live with that but teens  <br/>
can be inclined to blame their parent for choices they are not happy  <br/>
with and spend hours glowering.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not my experience. Not when they are clearly the ones who made  <br/>
the choice. I don&#39;t see why any of the results of her choice get  <br/>
thrown back at you unless she felt pressured by you to make that  <br/>
choice or to stick with it or something?<br/>
<br/>
  If my kid is glowering, I might ask, &quot;What can I do to make it  <br/>
better?&quot; Again, I&#39;d be as supportive as I could be short of taking ON  <br/>
her unhappiness, myself.<br/>
<br/>
If my kid was spending hours glowering at me over the misery of the  <br/>
school work she&#39;d chosen to take on, being unreasonable in targeting  <br/>
me since the choice was entirely hers, then I&#39;d find somewhere else to  <br/>
be until she got over it. It won&#39;t do her or me any good for me to get  <br/>
all worked up, too.<br/>
<br/>
Hoping this is helpful as this detach/support balance has been  <br/>
something I had to work hard on, myself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1399546674">A friend (unknowingly) mentored me in supportive detached role<br/>
playing.  I&#39;ve used it in parenting some but mostly while relating to<br/>
friends whose big deal is to be sad or critical.  I was privileged to<br/>
see how she interacted with her teens who were (and still are<br/>
sometimes) angsty and down.  She amazes me with her ability to listen<br/>
for seemingly hours (torturous to me) to her kids going on and on<br/>
about how bad they had/have it and *not* get caught up in it too.<br/>
<br/>
Most of it seems to be about perspective.  That whether it&#39;s for good<br/>
or ill, there are solutions to almost any problem, and where there<br/>
aren&#39;t desirable solutions, one can usually manage to go on<br/>
nonetheless and be fine anyway somehow.  I get the feeling most of the<br/>
time that she is waiting Buddha-like for the enlightenment of others<br/>
to unfold, as she listens, makes stuff to eat, has coffee, whatever<br/>
she finds to do.  And in the meantime, she enjoys the company, not of<br/>
their misery, but of them.<br/>
<br/>
That it&#39;s possible to do that is very inspirational.<br/>

 That&#39;s not my experience. Not when they are clearly the ones who made<br/>
  the choice. I don&#39;t see why any of the results of her choice get<br/>
  thrown back at you unless she felt pressured by you to make that<br/>
  choice or to stick with it or something?<br/>
<br/>
   If my kid is glowering, I might ask, &quot;What can I do to make it<br/>
  better?&quot; Again, I&#39;d be as supportive as I could be short of taking ON<br/>
  her unhappiness, myself.<br/>
<br/>
  If my kid was spending hours glowering at me over the misery of the<br/>
  school work she&#39;d chosen to take on, being unreasonable in targeting<br/>
  me since the choice was entirely hers, then I&#39;d find somewhere else to<br/>
  be until she got over it. It won&#39;t do her or me any good for me to get<br/>
  all worked up, too.<br/>
<br/>
  Hoping this is helpful as this detach/support balance has been<br/>
  something I had to work hard on, myself.<br/>

either has to wait until she is 20 which she is not inclined to do or  <br/>
as Sandra has said she can take some classes to get the credits.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Those are not the only two choices at all, though.<br/>
<br/>
If it were my child, I would start to collect stories of writers-- <br/>
which became better writers from taking writing courses at  <br/>
universities, and which just wrote and wrote, or learned from friends  <br/>
and editors or reading other authors.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Sandra suggested :<br/>
Find some honest,<br/>
clear options for her, present them to her, and then don&#39;t live<br/>
between her and the choice. It&#39;s an adult version of &quot;Do you want to<br/>
wear the pink coat or the black one?&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
That was my suggestion to get you out of the middle of her  <br/>
indecision.   It wasn&#39;t the way to get her into college.  It was  <br/>
brought here as a way to calm YOU down and help her stop waffling and  <br/>
whining (which it seems from what you wrote is part of the problem-- <br/>
she&#39;s saying &quot;yeah, but&quot; and &quot;no, because.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-can live with that but teens can be inclined to blame their parent  <br/>
for choices they are not happy with and spend hours glowering. Maybe  <br/>
I do just need to disengage. I will mull on that.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Co-dependency might be something to read about.  It seems you won&#39;t  <br/>
be happy  until she&#39;s happy, and that&#39;s not healthy for either of  <br/>
you.  It&#39;s like you&#39;re locked in an awkward wrestling hold and you&#39;re  <br/>
still trying to pretend to be relaxed and to eat, in that awkward  <br/>
position, and read, and watch TV, but you&#39;re totally in each others&#39;  <br/>
way.  (I could be wrong but it&#39;s an impression I&#39;m getting from the  <br/>
way you&#39;re writing and responding.)<br/>

<br/>
That might&#39;ve seemed that I was saying &quot;find THE TWO clear options  <br/>
and force her to choose.&quot;  I wasn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;s totally directionless, saying &quot;You could go north or you  <br/>
could go south&quot; might cause her to think &quot;Oh.  Right.  Choose a  <br/>
direction.  It seems East  northeast is a good one.&quot;   But the point  <br/>
would be SHE would be doing the choosing, not you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1959008489">-=-I was privileged to<br/>
see how she interacted with her teens who were (and still are<br/>
sometimes) angsty and down. She amazes me with her ability to listen<br/>
for seemingly hours (torturous to me) to her kids going on and on<br/>
about how bad they had/have it and *not* get caught up in it too.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think after half an hour it&#39;s kind of cruel not to find ways to try  <br/>
to bring them up, if she knows how.  I think if it goes on for days  <br/>
or weeks or months and she&#39;s waiting Buddha-like....  if it were me,  <br/>
I&#39;d feel sadistic, knowing that misery in the moment makes life  <br/>
miserable, and &quot;waiting&quot; (kind of gambling that they&#39;ll snap out of  <br/>
it on their own or live long enough for circumstances to happen to  <br/>
cheer them up).<br/>
<br/>
My kids are happy largely because Keith and I have been happy.  We&#39;ve  <br/>
found ways to see joy in normal little things, and we&#39;ve always  <br/>
helped our kids do that too.  When they were vaguely unhappy, we&#39;ve  <br/>
moved toward more happy, not maintenance of vague unhappiness.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Most of it seems to be about perspective. That whether it&#39;s for  <br/>
good or ill, there are solutions to almost any problem, and where  <br/>
there aren&#39;t desirable solutions, one can usually manage to go on  <br/>
nonetheless and be fine anyway somehow. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes there&#39;s nothing but time to help, like after a breakup with  <br/>
a boyfriend, or a friend moving away, or loss of a job or  <br/>
something.   Those do need for time to pass.  But some other  <br/>
situations are from circular, muddled thinking and that can be  <br/>
related (coming or going) to depression, or it can just set a yucky  <br/>
tone for the rest of the family.<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine, when people want to moan and complain and  <br/>
criticize, will listen for ten or fifteen minutes, and then say  <br/>
&quot;Okay, now say something good about him(/her/it).&quot;  It helps.<br/>

Good ideas for growing healthy people, and with people who probably<br/>
need someplace else to be than around their own kids, it may fall on<br/>
deaf ears the majority of the time.  It was a way for my friend to<br/>
avoid inserting herself into senseless arguments, and now the reason<br/>
for the insanity is no longer there and things are very different and<br/>
happier.<br/>
<br/>
In general, it really does help.... even with adults though that&#39;s<br/>
sort of taboo, telling adults a good thought in the midst of muddled<br/>
thinking or unthinking chatter.  Sometimes, depending on where I am<br/>
and who I am to the people I&#39;m talking with, I say &quot;so why or what do<br/>
you do xyz?&quot; or &quot;what keeps you going?&quot; or &quot;what do you *like* about<br/>
it or them or whatever?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I agree that can really help switch tracks, and maybe even spur some<br/>
personal growth and change.  It&#39;s a great thing to do within oneself<br/>
when thinking for long periods about bad things.<br/>

happily upbeat, complacent, but generally not sad or down.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easy to want to make everyone else around you happy too, and<br/>
sometimes it&#39;s hard to really understand why others aren&#39;t just happy. <br/>
It&#39;s an uncomfortable place to be, when others around you aren&#39;t<br/>
experiencing the happy peaceful existence you are.  Over the years, I&#39;ve<br/>
learned better how to not let that get me down.<br/>
<br/>
The last year, Chamille has really learned how to counter her negative<br/>
feelings.  She&#39;d get stuck in a downward spiral and there was really<br/>
nothing that I did that pulled her out, except to not go there with her.<br/>
If I was able to maintain a calm happy, she&#39;d eventually pull herself<br/>
up, I think, largely because she could visibly see that she was down,<br/>
since I was happy and up.  She knew where to go because she was able to<br/>
see that she had spiralled down.<br/>
<br/>
I think, if kids aren&#39;t able to see that they&#39;ve gone to that sad place,<br/>
because everyone is commiserating, and there with them, then the compass<br/>
is broken.  These days, Chamille is really good at being her own<br/>
compass, and that&#39;s really cool to see.  That doesn&#39;t mean that she<br/>
doesn&#39;t get stuck here and there or upset or angsty, it means that she<br/>
is more apt to recognize and change herself accordingly!</div>

to points in the game where you either need to quit/save or continue<br/>
playing and you have to use your handheld remote to check continue.<br/>
<br/>
That would give him a pretty good definition of continue right there,<br/>
with it&#39;s opposite right along side of the action of continuing or not.<br/>
<br/>
I remember one of my kids, maybe even both of them have asked what<br/>
continue is, while playing video games, and I&#39;d say, it means you want<br/>
to keep playing, so unless you&#39;re done playing, click that.  Sometimes,<br/>
it&#39;s been the word &quot;resume&quot;, which is similar, and because they already<br/>
knew the difference between quit and continue, they made the connection<br/>
between quit and resume offering the same choices.<br/>
<br/>
And now that I&#39;m thinking about it, it could&#39;ve just as easily been the<br/>
other way around... with Margaux for sure it was continue first, then<br/>
resume, Chamille&#39;s older and I forgot!  I guess it was whatever was on<br/>
Pokemon gameboy games and Spyro for PS!</div>

 </span></blockquote>Sandra objected that it is cruel to just wait and not help. I agree  <br/>
with that and wasn&#39;t suggesting that. So - clarification:<br/>
<br/>
My assumption was that help is always offered, real ideas, new ways of  <br/>
looking at the problem, questions asked that might help the person  <br/>
think about it more productively, etc. So - I&#39;m for sure not  <br/>
suggesting not helping. My comments about detachment have to do with  <br/>
the emotional aspect of it - how to be sympathetic and caring without  <br/>
being caught up in the emotions ourselves. How to stay clear-headed  <br/>
and not feel our kids&#39; emotions so strongly that we are just as unable  <br/>
to consider options as they are.<br/>
<br/>
Also, it can sometimes be apparent that the kid isn&#39;t actually looking  <br/>
for solutions and doesn&#39;t want to make a change, but wants sympathy  <br/>
for their &quot;plight&quot; (the plight they&#39;ve chosen to be in). Roxana has  <br/>
decided to go to a university in the fall to study acting and musical  <br/>
theater. She&#39;s decided to finish all the general education  <br/>
requirements in her last semester at the community college so that  <br/>
she&#39;ll have only theater-related courses when she is at the  <br/>
university. All her choice - all to do something she&#39;s SUPER excited  <br/>
and thrilled to do. If, halfway through the semester, she is moaning  <br/>
and groaning about how awful her teacher is, in one of those last few  <br/>
courses, if she is frustrated at the teacher&#39;s grading policies, or if  <br/>
she&#39;s bored out of her mind and wishes with all her heart that it was  <br/>
just over, then that is the time I&#39;d use that &quot;Buddha-like  <br/>
detachment.&quot;  I mean, if there is anything I could do to help make it  <br/>
more comfortable for her, I&#39;d offer that. But, I can imagine that  <br/>
there will be times during the semester that she&#39;ll really gripe and  <br/>
complain, but not want help or solutions, just sympathy. These are the  <br/>
times I have to watch myself, not to let myself get worked up and add  <br/>
to the emotional upheaval and drama in the house. That&#39;s the time I  <br/>
need to find my own center, be confident and calm that she&#39;ll get  <br/>
through this. I can do the helpful things - make sure she&#39;s getting  <br/>
fed well, help her get enough sleep, suggest any real options that I  <br/>
might think of. But I don&#39;t do anybody any good by getting my own  <br/>
emotions involved, by feeling frustrated or angry, myself.<br/>
<br/>
My kids will sometimes ask, &quot;Mom, can I just rant for a minute without  <br/>
you getting all upset?&quot; That&#39;s because I am quick to want to take  <br/>
action, to solve the problem. One of my kids got a &quot;B&quot; instead of an  <br/>
&quot;A&quot; in a design course because the teacher didn&#39;t give clear  <br/>
instructions about how to sign in and out of the lab. (My kid was the  <br/>
only person in the class that semester who hadn&#39;t taken the class  <br/>
previously.) She didn&#39;t want to appeal the grade or complain about it  <br/>
to the teacher, but she was upset about it. I&#39;m a person who takes  <br/>
action when I&#39;m upset; she really wanted to be able to complain to me,  <br/>
but didn&#39;t want me to tell her what to do about it. I said, &quot;You could  <br/>
talk to the teacher about it.&quot; She said, &quot;I feel stupid that I didn&#39;t  <br/>
understand.&quot; I said, &quot;She thought you knew, she wouldn&#39;t want you to  <br/>
get a lower grade than you deserve.&quot; Roxana said, &quot;I&#39;m fine. I&#39;ll take  <br/>
the B.&quot; But she was emotional about it and I was picking that up and  <br/>
getting upset on her behalf and getting upset with her that she would  <br/>
be upset but not do something about it.<br/>
<br/>
There are a couple of things I have to say about this kind of  <br/>
situation - but the most important is that the parent needs to find  <br/>
their own center and not drift over to taking on the emotions of their  <br/>
child. That&#39;s too much empathy. Second is that there is only so much  <br/>
&quot;emotional ranting&quot; that is reasonable to be expected to listen to - I  <br/>
have said, &quot;Okay, is it time to move on? Can you choose to be happier  <br/>
right now?&quot; That might seem cruel, like it is discounting their  <br/>
feelings, but I know that my kids can get caught up themselves in the  <br/>
emotions and find it hard to let go. That kind of emotion, negative as  <br/>
it is, is a rush, maybe it is adrenaline, and comes with a feeling of  <br/>
importance and significance, and self-righteousness. Again, though, I  <br/>
can really only help them move on if I&#39;m not also caught up in it.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing is that some people are intellectually quick-thinking  <br/>
and others process ideas more slowly. In the same way, some people  <br/>
have flashes of emotion and move quickly back to equilibrium while  <br/>
others build emotions slowly and/or get over them slowly. I have a kid  <br/>
who is quick-thinking in the intellectual realm and slow to process  <br/>
through her emotions. So, in the first few minutes of some upset I  <br/>
might offer a bunch of ideas for solutions - she&#39;ll hear those and  <br/>
process them. But she might not &quot;get over&quot; the emotions for quite a  <br/>
while after that, even when the solutions make perfect intellectual  <br/>
sense to her. If I keep repeating the ideas, as if she didn&#39;t  <br/>
understand them, that also frustrates her and makes her more upset.  <br/>
So, I offer ideas, and I know she heard them and is considering them.  <br/>
But then I back off and give her time and space to recover her  <br/>
equilibrium. If I&#39;m all upset emotionally, too, then it is going to be  <br/>
hard for me to back off - but what my kid needs from me at that point  <br/>
is to be calm, offer a cookie, smile benevolently, be more buddha-like.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-341095782">I would like to explore the world of teens for a bit.<br/>

I have a wonderful 16 and a 1/2 year old.  He is a very polite young man and we have a great relationship.  Here is my dilemma.<br/>
<br/>
He is extremely busy.  He now takes college classes, has a job and a girlfriend who he loves very much.(these are things that Mom can not be involved in)  He is always on the go.  I miss him.  When I support what he is doing he is happy easy going.  When I try to hold on to him and keep him close(for no good reason but me wanting him home with me) he gets quite unhappy and pulls away and hides in his room. When he is home because he wants to be he is out and engaged with the family.  How did those of you with great relationship with your adult children handle this time of your child&#39;s life?</div>

What are you interested in? No need to answer online ... maybe journal on<br/>
that question. It&#39;s hard if your life has been nothing but your child for<br/>
that child&#39;s entire lifetime and then suddenly the child&#39;s interests have<br/>

where you could insert yourself very easily or at all and still be welcome.<br/>

child wants that just so happens to lead in a direction away from you. It&#39;s<br/>
coincidental.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-927075699">I pulled back as much as she needed me to.  I talked to her about what she<br/>
needed from me and when she was going somewhere I offered her a ride or to<br/>
pick her up.  Sometimes she said great and other times she said no thanks.<br/>
I was available to her, but did not pressure her.<br/>
<br/>
It is hard to let your kids grow up, especially the first one, but it is<br/>
also exciting.  I try to focus on the happy, exciting parts.  Over the<br/>
weekend I met some of Sarah&#39;s new co-workers.  She&#39;s 18 and has her first<br/>
&quot;real&quot; job.  They each told me how glad they were to have her working with<br/>
them.  They described her as funny, kind, responsible and hardworking.  It&#39;s<br/>
great to hear those things from bosses and co-workers.  It makes me happy<br/>
for her and for everything that she will get to experience from here on.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s okay to feel sad about them growing up, but it&#39;s also good to<br/>
focus on the happy, exciting parts.<br/>

Wanting a teen home with you isn&#39;t as healthy for the teen as it might  <br/>
seem.  Without the instinct to leave the nest, all animals would  <br/>
probably still be home.  Even though unschooled teens aren&#39;t pushed  <br/>
out as much as schooled teens seem to be, they&#39;re still filled with  <br/>
the same biochemical realities and they DO naturally want to &quot;try  <br/>
their wings.&quot;  Their instinct is to be with people their age, then,  <br/>
rather than with parents.<br/>
<br/>
With schoolkids and all the related rules about ages and &quot;going out&quot;  <br/>
the problems often look like grounding and yelling and sneakiness.    <br/>
Those things never happened at our house (well, occasionally yelling,  <br/>
but usually that was me and I was really sorry I didn&#39;t just shush up).<br/>
<br/>
Without the choice to stay or go, neither a three year old nor a  <br/>
sixteen year old can choose to stay.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to spend time with a teen, find something really  <br/>
interesting to do, rather than just asking him to stay home with you.   <br/>
Marty and I went to look at ghost towns for a few days once.  Holly  <br/>
and I are going to Colorado for five days at the end of the month.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-655660267">With my first-born,16yr old ds, I have really been focusing on remaining<br/>
open to him when he does share a space with me. If he comes into the kitchen<br/>
for a snack and it&#39;s the first time we&#39;ve seen each other for little while,<br/>
I make sure I stay in the kitchen ready to listen and be available at that<br/>
moment. We talk in the car when I give him rides, but that may change now<br/>
that he has a driver&#39;s license. He likes to go grocery shopping with me, and<br/>
that is often when he chats me up about things that are happening in his<br/>
world and with friends.<br/>
<br/>
We enjoy sharing music, sending each other links of funny on-line videos,<br/>
interesting news stories, or movie previews. I really appreciate these<br/>
little intimacies a lot and I don&#39;t feel we are growing apart. He is growing<br/>
up and independent and that is a good thing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1011824262">I would add that you probably ought to concentrate on really cherishing <br/>
and enjoying and appreciating it when he does choose to spend time with you.<br/>
<br/>
You sort of skimmed over the girlfriend thing - as if him spending time <br/>
with her automatically excludes you. Do you spend time with them both, ever?<br/>
<br/>
I take Rosie and her boyfriend out to eat, sometimes. I buy. And I <br/>
invite them to go with me to some fun places, once in a while. And <br/>
sometimes they call me and ask me if I want to go with them somewhere, <br/>
too. I don&#39;t always say yes - because I don&#39;t want to wear out my <br/>
welcome. And I don&#39;t get grumpy when I&#39;m not invited, but focus on how <br/>
cool it is that I AM sometimes invited.<br/>
<br/>
You have little kids, too, so as much as you might enjoy him being home, <br/>
he might not be feeling like that is special time with you.<br/>
<br/>
Mostly, I want to say to enjoy the bits of time you get. Don&#39;t expect <br/>
long stretches of time - just appreciate and enjoy the moments.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My 3 hs kids are 14,16,18... which has been a trip, when I was having them, the thought of the eventual three teens in the house didn&#39;t occur to me... and it&#39;s been mostly delightful. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been in a bit of a holding pattern on many levels. And we&#39;ve been maoning over this and that, I&#39;ve been the worst. I&#39;ve found (again) that often I set the tone for the household.<br/>
<br/>
So recently, I&#39;ve made decisions and have started the actions to move and change things, better for the whole household. And we all feel so much better as noted by the lack of moaning & complaining.<br/>
<br/>
My three are homebodies, which is so different from how my dH and I were as teens, it&#39;s been strange. He & I talk about how different our parenting is from our parents and how different our kids are as people than how we were as teens. Believe me, it&#39;s a good thing! And I am oh so VERY grateful.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we five have our own stuff to attend to and we fb. If your child is over 13, I highly suggest fb. It&#39;s great fun and helps to keep me up with everything going on with them without being in their face about anything.<br/>
<br/>
I make sure that we have time in the car to discuss, catch up, whatever, whenever we&#39;re attending some event in town. The upside of living out from where things happen is the opportunity of time in the car to talk about stuff - and it doesn&#39;t seem like I&#39;m being nosey, just good conversation while we&#39;re going somewhere.</div>
