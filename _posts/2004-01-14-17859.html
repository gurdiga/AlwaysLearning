<div id="ygrps-yiv-533696854">I was listening to Janene tonight tell me things.  She told me Hermione <br/>
is smarter than Harry but Harry is more famous.  She told me that water <br/>
on bug bites is not good and that bug bites should not be cleaned with <br/>
soap, but instead covered with bandaides.  (currently she has four on <br/>
them).  She told me that cuddling is good for her, and that it&#39;s good <br/>
for me too.  She counted kisses as she covered me with kisses.  As she <br/>
was telling me all these things and more, I was listening and talking <br/>
with her, without judgement.  And I was thinking about the difference <br/>
between unschooling and schooling.<br/>
<br/>
With schooling, the teacher has the answers and it is the child&#39;s job to <br/>
find the RIGHT answer.  The teacher asks the questions and then <br/>
determines what the right answers are. <br/>
<br/>
With unschooling, the child finds the answers, provides the questions, <br/>
changes the questions, changes the answers, and generally figures it all <br/>
out.  The parent listens. <br/>
<br/>
The other day Janene said, as we were passing a mall, I  know how to <br/>
spell JC Pennys.  J C P E M Y S.  Mark immediately said something like <br/>
&quot;that&#39;s good janene, but the M is really two n&#39;s.&quot;  He still feel the <br/>
need to &quot;correct&quot; her.  I asked him, quietly, does it matter?  She&#39;ll <br/>
figure out soon enough those are two n&#39;s, do we need to tell her that <br/>
now?&quot;  You could tell, he was thinking about that.  He&#39;s come a long way. <br/>
<br/>
When Janene first learned to count she would count &quot;wrong&quot;  1, 2, 3, 5, <br/>
6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 15, etc.<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t correct her, we knew that she&#39;d figure it out.  We count <br/>
things all the time, even when I&#39;m alone I count stairs as I go up or <br/>
down.  Without any correction, without any worksheets on counting, <br/>
without anyone telling her anything or teaching her anything, she now <br/>
counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, <br/>
19, 20 kisses.  As she plasters these kisses all over my face.  Oh what <br/>
a lucky mommy I am.<br/>

Joylyn, that whole account of the kissing and cuddling was sweet and poetic <br/>
and beautiful.<br/>

people that I *value* :).<br/>

the point that they end up talking much more then Chloe does and I <br/>
see her getting frustrated. I often ask them the same question &quot;Does <br/>
it really matter?&quot;. They think it does, I don&#39;t. We are around my <br/>
family a lot and I need to really start helping them to understand <br/>
unschooling more. They are very receptive to my choice, they just <br/>
have a hard time implementing those ideas into their grown minds ;)<br/>

 <br/>
I was reminded how Andy counted by 2&#39;s --  1, 3, 5,7,  all the way up.  He insisted that counting must start with 1, and then you could count by 2&#39;s.  I remember thinking then, that would be exactly the kind of thinking that would get him into trouble in school, but at home as an unschooler, we just thought it was great he could count odds by 2!  <br/>
