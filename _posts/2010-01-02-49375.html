<div id="ygrps-yiv-1107545834">Hi: I used to work in a Montessori school (I still live four doors away from<br/>
it) and one of my long-time closest friends is a Waldorf teacher. I read<br/>
lots about Maria Montessori and Rudolph Steiner when my children were young,<br/>
before I began homeschooling/unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
What I took away from my reading was that Montessori and Steiner were trying<br/>
to create rich, supportive environments for children that had been damaged<br/>
by war (specifically low-income European children hurt by WWI).<br/>
<br/>
They both viewed their &quot;schools&quot; as substitutes for the home environment and<br/>
community culture that had been destroyed by the war. They emphasized<br/>
closely observing children, providing opportunities for children to learn<br/>
what they were interested in, not pressuring children to perform.<br/>
<br/>
Over the years Montessori&#39;s and Steiner&#39;s ideas have become codified, others<br/>
have written books, created curriculum and learning materials - little<br/>
industries have grown up around their ideas, and often stray pretty far from<br/>
the original intent.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering I&#39;m seeing that beginning with unschooling. In February I&#39;ll<br/>
be at an unschooling conference, and I noticed more than one of the speakers<br/>
makes their living from selling things to unschoolers.  Not quite sure what<br/>
to think about that, but it makes me a little uncomfortable.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes, Cara<br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s no way anyone is &quot;making a living&quot; selling anything to  <br/>
unschoolers, so don&#39;t feel too much weight of that.<br/>
<br/>
In all the years I&#39;ve spoken at conferences and sold books, I&#39;ve  <br/>
usually broken even and sometimes gone in the hole. Two years (maybe  <br/>
three) there was profit and we declared it on taxes, and then paid 30%  <br/>
because that&#39;s what Keith&#39;s income tax rate is, federal and state.<br/>
<br/>
As there&#39;s nothing unschoolers are required to own or use, it&#39;s not  <br/>
going to be possible for anyone to corruptly monopolize the market.<br/>
<br/>
There aren&#39;t so many unschoolers that anyone could make a living off  <br/>
of them.<br/>
