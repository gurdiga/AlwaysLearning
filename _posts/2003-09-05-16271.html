It was discussed on &quot;the other list&quot; but is still being discussed and in <br/>
better detail at www.unschooling.com, and if you go to message boards, and then to <br/>
the bottom box and <br/>
<br/>
Oh, here:<br/>

That goes to new messages.  Tell them you want 11 days,and you can read it, <br/>
maybe the first set of messages that will show.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It was exhausting.  Lots of the kids got sick (exhaustion, not great food, <br/>
really dirty swimming pool), and then even my kids who didn&#39;t go got sick of <br/>
more local reasons, but Marty and I were there and had a lot of fun.<br/>
<br/>
Marty got up early every morning to go to breakfast with me and Pam <br/>
Sorooshian (we missed her one morning).  We needed to go but Marty could have slept.  <br/>
On the morning after I knew he and some other kids had been up until 4:00 a.m., <br/>
I woke him up just ten minutes before breakfast, guessing he&#39;d rather sleep.  <br/>
He said he wanted to come and to hear me speak.  I said it&#39;s okay to miss, I <br/>
always talk about the same things anyway, and he said that&#39;s okay, &quot;I like <br/>
listening to your crazy theories.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
So he got up and we went!<br/>
<br/>
I started off collecting autographs and photos of people (taking their <br/>
pictures, with families if they were close, but things happened, and I got separated <br/>
from my book for a while, and the battery quit working on the flash, and soon <br/>
it was just too busy a party to remember, so though I WISH I had everyone&#39;s <br/>
signatures I don&#39;t.  And I don&#39;t have pictures of lots of it, though I took <br/>
quite a few.  (Not developed yet.)<br/>
<br/>
The other list, which was once unschooling-dotcom and was then <br/>
unschooling-discussion is now unschoolingdiscussion without a hyphen, and it was transferred <br/>
from HEM&#39;s ownership to be a joint project of Joyce Fetteroll, Pam Sorooshian <br/>
and me.  <br/>
