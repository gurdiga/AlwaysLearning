<div id="ygrps-yiv-137210195">Hi. <br/>
<br/>
I was thinking that it might be nice for DD (when she&#39;s old enough) to go to some <br/>
kind of day camp or sleepaway summer camp. Do you think it&#39;s best to just wait and <br/>
see if she asks to go? Or is there a special camp just for unschoolers? <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know why I feel so strongly that camp is a good idea. Maybe because they have <br/>
equipment and activities that I wouldn&#39;t have access to (water skiing, ceramics, theater <br/>
productions, canoe trips, horseback riding, etc.) or maybe because I feel it&#39;s healthy <br/>
for kids to be away from their parents sometimes? <br/>
<br/>
She is so kinetic, asking her to sit still in school all day would just crush her spirit, I <br/>
know it. At camp she&#39;d get to do tennis and volleyball and soccer and softball etc. <br/>
<br/>
Thoughts?<br/>

My daughter went to NBTSC at 15 and did not like it at all.  And <br/>
there are no special facilities whatsoever, no special anything.  <br/>
Just lots of rain and cold and terrible food, and some very <br/>
unpleasant experiences.  She lost weight and as a 98# athlete she did <br/>
not need to lose an ounce.   She found it to be basically a <br/>
contemporary unschoolers&#39; Lord of the Flies.  Not that I advocate <br/>
lots of supervision, but there were things happening, life-<br/>
endangering things in some cases, that needed much better supervision <br/>
and follow-up, IMHO.   Some of the other things that happened, though <br/>
not at all life-threatening, could have used some adult intervention; <br/>
things like physical coercion and racial slurs, for example. <br/>
<br/>
But it probably depends on your child.  This past summer, at 16, my <br/>
daughter went to a pre-college two week course instead, lived on <br/>
campus with many other teens and college students including about 20% <br/>
homeschooled, took raku and pit-firing ceramics.  She loved it!  <br/>
Loved the whole thing.  The food, the other kids (14-18), the staff, <br/>
the campus, the un-airconditioned dorms, the huge beautiful campus, <br/>
and she especially liked being treated like any other coed.  She <br/>
would go back there in a minute, thinks she wants to go to college <br/>
there.  <br/>
<br/>
And she has attended other good camps, too, with 4-H, with a local <br/>
homeschool group, and several church teen group camping experiences <br/>
(Unitarian).  All were good experiences for her. But NBTSC was not.  <br/>
Please note that she attended the east coast camp in W. Virginia.  We <br/>
don&#39;t know anything about the west coast version.  <br/>
<br/>
I learned that the NBTSC fan club is a very tight-knit cheering <br/>
section, and is not at all nice to anyone whose child doesn&#39;t adore <br/>
the experience.  They formally shun those who question what goes on <br/>
at these camps and will prohibit any detractor from being on their <br/>
list.  All they want you to hear are the good reports, and if anyone <br/>
disagrees they are e-excommunicated.  You call that freedom?  Not <br/>
me.  But the rhetoric you will get regarding the kids is all about <br/>
freedom, supposedly.  I would be very cautious with any group that <br/>
operates in this manner.  Real freedom means that all sides, good and <br/>
bad, are available to those who inquire.  <br/>
<br/>
From the teens&#39; list my daughter learned that someone was spreading <br/>
rumors that her mother (me) was suing NBTSC camp and Grace <br/>
Llewellyn.  Never crossed my mind.  But there are others who had much <br/>
better reason to consider suing.  Perhaps they are, or did.  I simply <br/>
will not recommend it.  Personally I feel that a great family or <br/>
homeschool or church teen trek to some well-chosen wilderness area, <br/>
backpacking in and enjoying the beauty and the fun of exploring one&#39;s <br/>
survival skills, would be a much better investment of time and money.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-190170558">Thanks, Norma, for being honest.  I appreciate that.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest is only 8, so this is not an issue at this time, I just was <br/>
impressed with the content on the web.<br/>
<br/>
I was also thinking that a UU camp might also be a good one... at least <br/>
the one where they also have homeschool family camp.  Lexie wants to <br/>
attend their youth camp this summer, and I think I&#39;ll let her go.  Of <br/>
course, it&#39;s more supervised, cause the kids are 8-12, I think.  They <br/>
also have a teen one. <br/>

One of the best UU camps, I am told, is the one up in New England.  I <br/>
can&#39;t remember the name of it right now, but it is on the UU list.  <br/>
In our locale the teens do a group camp out every year and I went <br/>
along this year as an adult volunteer.  That basically meant just <br/>
watching and enjoying the teens interacting.  It was a great <br/>
experience!  The teens stayed up all night each night, piled around <br/>
the campfire.  And there were no problems whatsoever.  Different <br/>
parents trucked food in for each meal, and the food was awesome.  The <br/>
teens spent one whole day at an outdoor high-ropes course and it was <br/>
amazing to watch them face these challenges and conquer their fears.  <br/>
I would highly recommend this type of experience for anyone.  From <br/>
one year to the next I am told that each teen pushes his or her <br/>
envelope a little further, conquers a few more fears, takes a few <br/>
more risks.  My daughter loved it and can&#39;t wait to go again this <br/>
year.  And, for those who are not UU, our teen groups welcomes any <br/>
others who wanted to go along.  And the price was far better than <br/>
NBTSC, with great food to boot.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1201710221">Lots of day camps become more like day school,<br/>
unfortunately, with very little freedom, moving from<br/>
activity to activity at the sound of a whistle or<br/>
bell, lots of sitting waiting for a turn at something.<br/>
<br/>
You might consider finding one that is focused around<br/>
one of her interests, like art camp, or horse back<br/>
riding, or nature, that is only 1/2 day to begin with.<br/>
<br/>
I let my daughter go to overnight camp last summer at<br/>
13.5, and I missed her terribly.  I don&#39;t think I<br/>
could have done it when she was 8. LOL!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1480823421">You are right about the friend thing.  Lexie&#39;s best friend is Greek <br/>
Orthodox, her dad is a priest.  Lexie wants to go with Hibi to their <br/>
youth summer camp, and I would more than allow it, even given the fairly <br/>
strong religious componet of the camp.  It is very structured, with <br/>
almost no free time (because in their experience, the schooled kids who <br/>
usually go can&#39;t handle any time that is not structured, they get into <br/>
trouble), but Lexie really wants to go.  btw, Hibi is pretty much <br/>
unschooled as well. <br/>

<br/>
Yes, I&#39;ve heard good things about the California UU camp, too.  I <br/>
also have to say that my child has decided that she really likes <br/>
being in a mixed group, not strictly home educators, and not just <br/>
unschoolers. This is the real world, all different kinds of people, <br/>
and she feels that this kind of experience, whether it&#39;s camping or <br/>
anything else, is better for her.  There is something very insular <br/>
and also very restricted in the predominantly white, predominantly <br/>
upper middle class unschooling community.  She actually finds the UU <br/>
kids to be much more open-minded, and definitely more inclusive and <br/>
more integrated.  <br/>
<br/>
Yes, I know that all unschoolers are not from a high income strata, <br/>
because we aren&#39;t.  But she found NBTSC to be very cliquish, more so <br/>
than most any other experience she has had.  And part of that is <br/>
perhaps because many of these kids have been attending for years <br/>
(kids who can afford that, hence a certain income bracket, which is <br/>
separative to begin with) and stick with their own group of friends.  <br/>
Wheras she did not find this at all at Earlham College&#39;s two-week <br/>
summer Explore-A-College program, a very homeschool friendly program, <br/>
by the way.  <br/>
<br/>
If anyone plans to go to NBTSC my daughter and I both recommend <br/>
taking along a goodly stash of food, just in case.  Almost all of the <br/>
kids in her cabin who had attended camp before had brought boxes and <br/>
bags of their own food.  She felt we had been lied to about the <br/>
food.  We were told that it would be good healthy predominantly <br/>
vegetarian food.  It wasn&#39;t.  My daughter has chosen all her life to <br/>
be a lacto-ovo vegetarian and she found very little that was <br/>
acceptable to eat at the NBTSC that she attended.  Plus she also <br/>
found that a certain group of campers hoarded all the good food, took <br/>
it back to their cabins for themselves.  With no adult intervention <br/>
she went through a week with very little sustenance to ward off the <br/>
damp and cold.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand she attended a Swedenborgian church camp with some <br/>
friends, like what your daughter is considering doing, and loved it <br/>
but said there were more Christian elements to deal with than she <br/>
liked.  But she still had a very good time, made good friends.  4-H <br/>
camp, which in most parts of the country anyone can attend, even if <br/>
they are not in 4-H, was more structured, too, but she enjoyed it, <br/>
had her first slow dancing (and her first crush) there with a very <br/>
nice boy, at 12.  She also attended a 4-H art day-camp in a nearby <br/>
county one summer when she was even younger (11) and loved it.<br/>
<br/>
So, yes, consider your child and her propensities, and choose what <br/>
might work best for her.  As for getting it &quot;straight from the <br/>
horse&#39;s mouth&quot; on the NBTSC kids&#39; list, they, too, do not want anyone <br/>
to say anything negative about &quot;their&quot; camp, and can be just as <br/>
malicious and vindictive as some of the very censoring parents.  I <br/>
just know that we were far from the only folks who attended camp in <br/>
W. Virginia who were unhappy with this specific NBTSC session.  All <br/>
who were unhappy have been censored or driven from the adult and <br/>
kids&#39; NBTSC lists.  Doesn&#39;t give anyone a very realistic picture.  <br/>
And when I compared my daughter&#39;s experience at two other camps the <br/>
following summer, well, they were so much better, she enjoyed them so <br/>
much more.  And she felt she came away with a much more valuable life <br/>
experience.  <br/>
<br/>
As for making friends, she is involved in so many outside activities <br/>
that she has plenty of opportunities to make friends, from <br/>
homeschoolers, to unschoolers, to everyone else, and all ages, too.  <br/>
She is a volunteer at our local museum center (history and science <br/>
and children&#39;s musuems), a historical interpreter at our local <br/>
historical village, involved in many community service projects, <br/>
started her own 4-H club, started her own homeschool Junior Statesman <br/>
Foundation group (grades 9-12), is a competitive figure skater (9 <br/>
years), and is a ceramicist who has been taking ceramics (pottery) <br/>
and other art courses from a local art foundation for six years, is <br/>
now the only teen in an adult ceramics center/studio, working on <br/>
perfecting her centering and throwing skills.  <br/>
<br/>
She also works part-time at her local ice rink and at our local <br/>
library.  She has adult coaches with whom she is close and a bunch of <br/>
really great librarians with whom she enjoys working very much.  And <br/>
she has her UU teen friends, as well as the great group of adults <br/>
there, lots of opportunities to interact socially.  Her current <br/>
boy/friend is someone she met at a party through other friends, the <br/>
usual way, and someone equally artsy (a jazz musician) who attends <br/>
one of the local performing arts public schools.  Next weekend she <br/>
will be attending her third winter formal dance at a local high <br/>
school, her fifth formal dance since she was 13.  Just wanted to <br/>
establish that we are not talking about someone who is in any way <br/>
socially isolated or who has limited social skills.  <br/>
<br/>
Pick whatever camps or experiences you choose based on your <br/>
daughter&#39;s interests and know that how much you spend, or how reknown <br/>
the camp&#39;s founder is (because she wrote a book about other people&#39;s <br/>
unschooling experiences) does not make a camp better than some other <br/>
experience.  I guess I have been most disappointed in the way the <br/>
parents acted when I voiced my complaints about this camp.  You&#39;d <br/>
have thought I was attacking them personally when I expressed my <br/>
unhappiness with some of the things my daughter experienced at <br/>
NBTSC.  Rather than saying, wow, they would really want to see that <br/>
kind of thing not happen and would work to help get it changed, they <br/>
just circled the wagons, attacked me, then excluded me from their <br/>
list.  NBTSC, love it, or leave it!  No one offered to set up a <br/>
parents&#39; committee to try to see that these types of things would not <br/>
happen again or find solutions to these problems.  And I think <br/>
physical coercion, racial slurs and dealing with other suicidal teens <br/>
is much more serious than just being cold all the time and not having <br/>
enough to eat for a week.  That&#39;s really all I have to say.<br/>
