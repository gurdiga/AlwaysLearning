<div id="ygrps-yiv-1230130812">Adam already at the apple.. his choice!  TV isn&#39;t evil... you&#39;re choice to<br/>
watch it or not... we all have choices!  It&#39;s your choice to sit in front of<br/>
the TV and veg all day... and if you feel bad about that then you make the<br/>
choice to turn it off.  You&#39;re vilifying it!  It&#39;s NOT evil in and of itself<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Unbelievable that in a world where SO many other BIG issues surround us...<br/>
that people choose to obsess about the &quot;evil&quot; TV!  Argh!<br/>

Men are still blaming Eve for offering that apple.<br/>
<br/>
People LIKE to feel powerless, I guess.  This whole &quot;let them choose&quot;  <br/>
philosophy is way too scary for some grown, adult humans.<br/>
