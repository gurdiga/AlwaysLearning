<div id="ygrps-yiv-1381381683">It was the first day of school and a new student named Martinez, <br/>
the son of a Mexican restaurateur, entered the fourth grade. <br/>
<br/>
The teacher said, &quot;Let&#39;s begin by reviewing some American <br/>
history. <br/>
<br/>
Who said &quot;Give me Liberty, or give me Death?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
She saw a sea of blank faces, except for Martinez, who had his <br/>
hand up. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Patrick Henry, 1775.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Very good! <br/>
<br/>
Who said &#39;Government of the people, by the people, for the <br/>
people, shall not perish from the earth&#39;&quot;? <br/>
<br/>
Again, no response except from Martinez: &quot;Abraham Lincoln, <br/>
1863.&quot;, said Martinez. <br/>
<br/>
The teacher snapped at the class, &quot;Class, you should be ashamed. <br/>
Martinez, who is new to our country, knows more about its <br/>
history than you do.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
She heard a loud whisper: &quot;Screw the Mexicans.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Who said that?&quot; she demanded. <br/>
<br/>
Martinez put his hand up. &quot;Jim Bowie, 1836.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
At that point, a student in the back said, &quot;I&#39;m gonna puke.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
The teacher glares and asks &quot;All right! Now, who said that?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Again, Martinez says, &quot;George Bush to the Japanese Prime <br/>
Minister, 1991.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Now furious, another student yells, &quot;Oh yeah? Suck this!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Martinez jumps out of his chair waving his hand and shouts to the <br/>
teacher, &quot;Bill Clinton, to Mon! ica Lewinsky, 1997!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Now with almost a mob hysteria someone sa id, &quot;You little shit. If <br/>
you say anything else, I&#39;ll kill you.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Martinez frantically yells at the top of his voice, &quot;Gary Condit <br/>
to Chandra Levy 2001.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
The teacher fainted. <br/>
<br/>
And as the class gathered around the teacher on the floor, <br/>
someone said, &quot;Oh shit, we&#39;re in BIG trouble!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Martinez said, &quot;Saddam Hussein 2003.&quot;</div>
