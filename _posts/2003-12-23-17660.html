Hello Heidi,<br/>
<br/>
I can relate to your posts, since my husband and I just argued about this <br/>
this past weekend. What we&#39;ve been doing for years is to make one night a week, <br/>
usually a weekend night, our &quot;date&quot; night. We tell the kids they have to stay <br/>
out of the room during the movie and don&#39;t interuppt unless it&#39;s a fire, <br/>
earthquake, flood or other natural disaster. ;) We usually get chinese food for our <br/>
date and enjoy ourselves. The reason we do not go out much is for a once a <br/>
week date, that can get expensive, and we&#39;re a large family living in one income. <br/>
Now....what&#39;s the deal with you sleeping downstairs with the girls? I hope <br/>
everythings okay that way. I sometimes sleep on the couch, but it&#39;s only because <br/>
I want to stay up really late and don&#39;t want to bother him. <br/>
Anyway, make it a priority to do something together once a week (at least). I <br/>
hope it works out for you!!<br/>
:) Amy<br/>

This is supposidly a myth (love my creative spelling, this is the one <br/>
list I can sorta feel comfortable not fixing it). However, I personally <br/>
always get a little sick after the shot.<br/>
<br/>
I am supposed to get one every year, but with a new car, a car accident, <br/>
my sister who is sick, my job (teaching) which is a pain, and my <br/>
impending (and now over) surgery, it never happened. now it won&#39;t as <br/>
there are none left. I have lung issues so it would have been better if <br/>
I had gotten one. My kids didn&#39;t get one either, nor did Mark... I <br/>
guess I will rely upon lots of white light and healthy living.<br/>

We went to Florida last January and are going again this year as well (for<br/>
the Disney Marathon on 1/11).<br/>
<br/>
We bring lots of wipes and disinfect our seating area of the plane, drink<br/>
lots of water, and pray ;).<br/>
<br/>
A few weeks ago, we actually took our kids twice in one weekend to Chuck E.<br/>
Cheese germ pit, and were fortunate to emerge unscathed (not even a<br/>
sniffle).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d go, be more diligent about hand washing, and HAVE FUN!!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;PS. BEWARE of the flumist..it carries 3 live strains of the flu!! <br/>
 </span></blockquote>if your considering it PLEASE reconsider. (hospital employees are <br/>
being told if they are going to take the flumist it is mandatory <br/>
that they stay home for 3 weeks before returning to work!) &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I find this little fact rather alarmist. There&#39;s a good reason hospital <br/>
workers should be careful with Flumist, and it&#39;s not because the vaccine is so <br/>
dangerous to them. It&#39;s dangerous to the very sick people that they care for in <br/>
their jobs. <br/>
<br/>
From www.snopes.com:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;But even for the healthy 5- to 49-year-olds, the spray vaccine poses a risk, <br/>
if not to them, then to those they come into contact with. In a few <br/>
instances, those who receive this live vaccine will as a consequence spread it to <br/>
others, so FluMist isn&#39;t recommended for people who take care of or live with <br/>
either the elderly or those at risk of severe flu complications. The live virus can <br/>
be transmitted to others by way of coughing, sneezing, or talking, or via a <br/>
fomite, an item touched by someone who has the virus. (Common cold, flu, and <br/>
stomach viruses can live on the fingertips for hours, and they can survive on <br/>
the surfaces of objects for days.) &quot;<br/>

Subject: Re: time alone with dh<br/>
<br/>
Amy, the one night/a week movie would be great, except I have a 1 yr old <br/>
that the older girls, 7 & 5, can handle for a little while, but not the <br/>
length of a movie. Hiring a sitter is too pricey for us with our <br/>
finances and the four girls.<br/>
<br/>
The deal with our sleeping arrangement is this: I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s <br/>
ever okay to not answer a child&#39;s cry at night, and I believe in <br/>
co-sleeping with babies...and I have four children. So by the time I <br/>
had Leiren, the forth, I was bed-hopping so much at night, with the <br/>
baby, that I would wake up and not know where I was, plus dh would get <br/>
woken up every time in jumped in or out of our bed. He&#39;s a farmer and <br/>
desperately needs good sleep or he could get hurt at work. We put a <br/>
full-size bed in our library for when my grandmother came to visit and <br/>
it was still here, so the girls and I just started sleeping there. It&#39;s <br/>
been awesome! They&#39;re comfortable going to sleep when they&#39;re tired and <br/>
they&#39;re not scared of being alone, because I&#39;m downstairs with them and <br/>
whenever they wake up (anytime 9-12) they wake up right next to all the <br/>
activity, they just join in. One of the best parts is since we started, <br/>
I now get to sleep ALL night, and for the first time in 7 years feel <br/>
like I&#39;m getting enough rest. I&#39;ve been able to cut way back on my <br/>
coffee. Technically, I wasn&#39;t really sleeping in the bed with dh <br/>
before, and all of our nights were disruptive. Now it&#39;s just a lot <br/>
better :)<br/>
<br/>
Have the Happiest of Holidays!<br/>

Sorry everyone...I forgot to mention we&#39;d definitely be driving to <br/>
Florida. I do feel that if we use things like Purell hand sanitizer a <br/>
lot and wash our hands we&#39;ll be okay. It&#39;s just upsetting to hear about <br/>
children dying, especially healthy ones who are dead within days. But <br/>
we are all healthy and we&#39;ll just have to do our best to stay that way. <br/>
Getting out of the crowded New York winter rooms would have to help a <br/>
little. We really need a little heat and sunshine in our lives. We&#39;ll <br/>
be staying with dh&#39;s parents, which can be stressful, but also means mil <br/>
will babysit so we can go to dinner and the beach til midnight. Dh and <br/>
I desperately NEED that!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for your advice. Happy Holidays. Heidi<br/>

Subject: Re: time alone with dh<br/>
<br/>
I used to go to sleep with a kid (or two or three) and nursing them would <br/>
knock me RIGHT out,but after a few hours when I woke up I would go and wake my <br/>
husband up in a way that he didn&#39;t mind, and we&#39;d have some alone time and that <br/>
would knock me right out, and so I got two short yet deep sleeps, and he <br/>
preferred a 2:00 or 3:00 a.m. visitation to none at all.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t cover movies and conversation, though. That we did in the car, <br/>
or by watching movies we could watch with the kids.<br/>
<br/>
Now that the kids are older, we&#39;ve had two &quot;disagreements&quot; where I made a <br/>
suggestion (complained ) and he got angry. Both were the same thing, and both <br/>
recent.<br/>
<br/>
With kids there, where we&#39;re all in one place and could potentially be having <br/>
fun, he has started on some long story about someone at work whose job <br/>
involves this or that project management and... and it&#39;s too removed and boring for <br/>
ME, and means absolutely nothing whatsoever to the kids present (once Holly <br/>
and her friend in the car, and once Holly and Marty at the dinner table) so <br/>
they&#39;re completely shut out of the conversation and end up zoning out their <br/>
individual ways or wandering off.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think parents&#39; &quot;along time&quot; should come when the kids are there.<br/>
<br/>
I had a male friend who had a girlfriend who had a little girl. He broke up <br/>
with her after a while, because when he would come over, she would make her <br/>
little girl stay in her room the whole time, and he couldn&#39;t relax or feel good <br/>
knowing that he was the catalyst for their separation and that little girl&#39;s <br/>
unhappiness. And would the girl EVER have liked Bob? She probably hated him <br/>
passionately because she was banished from his presence (by her mom).<br/>
<br/>
We traded babysitting with other families when the kids were little, and so <br/>
it was not like being sent to a babysitter, it was just like going to play with <br/>
their friends, so we were able to get dinner-date opportunities or boring <br/>
shopping opportunities that way, and the kids didn&#39;t feel shunted off at all.<br/>

Why? People die from flu EVERY year. The media has a very sad way of<br/>
taking a little blip and turning it into a huge mountain. I take everything<br/>
from the media with a grain of salt. It is their job to get you to follow<br/>
more media stories. The best way to do that is to keep a crisis going.<br/>
<br/>
Someone in your family is much more likely to die in a car crash going to<br/>
the grocery store than to die from the flu. But I bet you still go buy<br/>
groceries.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry......didn&#39;t mean to rant but the media makes me nuts.<br/>
<br/>
If you are really concerned, take along some of that handwash gel that you<br/>
don&#39;t need to wash off and just do everybodies hands several times a day.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hi everyone. I hope your holidays are going well. I have a question<br/>
&gt; for all of you. Dh and I are planning to go to Florida for the first<br/>
&gt; two weeks of January (we&#39;re in NY). My mom called me tonight almost<br/>
&gt; hysterical because she saw on the news that another little girl, age 4,<br/>
&gt; died from the flu. She said we really shouldn&#39;t go on vacation because<br/>
&gt; none of us, especially the girls (ages 7, 5, 3, and 1) have had flu<br/>
&gt; shots. Instinctively, I feel we should stay home, for that and<br/>
&gt; finances, but dh desperately needs a vacation due to mental health<br/>
&gt; reasons. What would all of you suggest? Those of you in Florida, what<br/>
&gt; are your flu stats? I expect we&#39;ll go, but I am really worried about it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for your advice, Heidi<br/>

We went to Florida over Thanksgiving, Universal Studios, you would think we <br/>
could not come out without catching something but we were fine, no colds, no <br/>
flu. But we went to Maine for a few days a week ago for a wedding and all came <br/>
back sick. LOL<br/>

Someone posted not too long ago about their dd being bored. We just <br/>
found some really cool online activities for girls who are into dolls, <br/>
make-up, and dress-up. My dd&#39;s ages 7, 5, and 3 have totally taken over <br/>
my computer for about 3 days since we found all this and our fridge is <br/>
plastered with their printouts. These are the sites-<br/>

<br/>
Even I have had fun doing making my own pictures on what&#39;s her face. <br/>
Well, just a thought for any of you with girls wandering around saying <br/>
they&#39;re bored. Good luck. Heidi<br/>

son having some allergies which affect his behvaior or<br/>
emotions biochemically.<br/>
