<div id="ygrps-yiv-1411512288">This is a pretty good article - a little meatier than is typical. But<br/>
here is the final paragraph:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;While the debate about its merits and potential pitfalls will only<br/>
heighten if unschooling becomes more prevalent across Canada, the<br/>
truest test will ultimately lie with the kids themselves. Whether they<br/>
succeed (or fail) as they enter postsecondary school and then the<br/>
workforce will be a very real study on whether this educational<br/>
philosophy will thrive in the future, or fall onto the philosophical<br/>
ash heap as a discredited relic of the past.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The full article is here:<br/>

<br/>
What I object to in that last paragraph is the clear bias that success<br/>
or failure depends on entering &quot;postsecondary school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Asking whether or not they CAN be successful in postsecondary school<br/>
is fine - there are enough of them out there who have already done it<br/>
to answer that question with a resounding, &quot;Yes, they can if they so<br/>
choose.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But it is such a limited and sad little way to measure &quot;success.&quot;<br/>
