<div id="ygrps-yiv-51109817">Long story short:<br/>
We messed up and I&#39;m not sure how to fix it. We offered our 12 year old an iPad in exchange for helping to watch his 4 year old brother for 3 weeks while we worked a Christmas tree lot.  He lasted 1 week before quitting and not helping out at all the final 2 weeks. He did great the first week and it takes 2 weeks for Apple to ship the iPad so I ordered it. It came today and he&#39;s upset that he doesn&#39;t get it, even though we talked about it weeks ago after he quit.  He was upset and crying and wouldn&#39;t talk about it. <br/>
I am not sure what to say or do in order to have him feel better without giving him something he didn&#39;t earn. I know it was a crappy deal to make and we should never have done it. We are new to unschooling and at times revert to the way we did things in the past. <br/>
I&#39;ll end by saying that we didn&#39;t scold or belittle him when he didn&#39;t fulfill his agreement. He asked of he could still have the iPad and I told him he couldn&#39;t. I was a little surprised when he burst into hysterics tonight, but I guess the site of it made him feel like a failure and that bothers me. <br/>
P.S. I read all the new member guidelines before posting. :)</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perhaps. But since he asked if he could have it then burst into hysterics, I suspect the iPad is something that seems very important to him. It&#39;s right there within his reach but you&#39;re a barrier between him and it.<br/>
<br/>
What principle are you standing by? And is that principle more important than him, his feelings and your relationship with him?<br/>
<br/>
While I agree that offering someone payment for a job then giving them the payment even if they don&#39;t do the job is a poor set of values. So, don&#39;t hold those values. Don&#39;t make another deal like that that would put you in this position.<br/>
<br/>
Apologize for setting up such a big deal around a job he wasn&#39;t ready to handle. Apologize for tying the job to something he really wanted. Give him the iPad. And then don&#39;t make another deal like that. In the future help him get what&#39;s important to him. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>So you made a mistake and promissed him something  in exchange for something he could not handle and now he is being punished  for it.<br/>
I would have wrapped the IPad and given him for Christmas ( if that is what you celebrate for the Holidays).  <br/>
I would have been grateful he was so good to his little brother for a week and helped out. <br/>
It was not his mistake. I sounds like he tried his best and just could not handle it. I sounds like it was too much for him.<br/>
I would have cried and gone into hysterics too. I would have dreamed about that Ipad for weeks.<br/>

He was too little for that job.  You failed; he didn&#39;t.  <br/>
If you agreed to dam up a river for a trip to DisneyWorld, and it turned out to be impossible for you to dam up the river, you didn&#39;t fail.  The person who made the offer cheated you cruelly.<br/>

You&#39;re not building a good relationship in any way, nor are you moving toward unschooling.<br/>

Are you using an iPad to train him?  To shame him?  <br/>
An iPad is a fantastic learning tool.  Learning should be your primary focus.  I hope by the time you read this, he&#39;s been playing the iPad for many hours and you&#39;ve apologized profusely.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1343514204">You tell him, &quot;We made a mistake. Ew gave you a job that was too big for<br/>
you. But you did an excellent job the first week and we would really like<br/>
you to have this, since it is so important to you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you something more, for yourselves, to somehow justify that, you could<br/>
try this: Sit down by yourselves first. Figure out how much the iPad cost.<br/>
Figure out how many hours of helping he did. Divide the cost of the iPad by<br/>
the number of hours. We often pay teen sitters less than adults, but I<br/>
personally think it should be more - very often, the teen is more likely to<br/>
play with the kid and the job is HARDER for the teen than the adult. Very<br/>
likely, the cost per hour would be worth it to you.<br/>
<br/>
Alternatively, you could just tell yourself that you are fulfilling a<br/>
much-wanted wish if your son with a device you already have. And you know<br/>
it will be useful to him - fun AND he will learn a lot from it.<br/>
<br/>
I remember something similar from my own childhood and my mom never gave me<br/>
the item I wanted. The lesson I took from that was that my mom was that<br/>
sticking to her guns was apparently more important than me - because I<br/>
tried my best but it was too much.<br/>
<br/>
Ask yourself what the more loving choice is: holding onto the iPad because<br/>
he didn&#39;t &quot;earn it&quot; or giving it to him because it will bring him a lot of<br/>
joy?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
PS - as a compromise, if Christmas is something you celebrate, it would<br/>
make an excellent gift - he earned part, you gifted the rest.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1260191738">It&#39;s very hard to move to unschooling, after years of &quot;traditional&quot; parenting. I am new to it too, and at times, I find myself torn between the old way I parented, and this new way. Learning to trust your child to become a responsible person without using limitation, bribes, punishments, etc. is tough. You are going to mess up sometimes. It&#39;s alright to ask for advice from veteran unschoolers. No one can become an expert at unschooling overnight. If you do mess up, apologize. Tell your kid where you were coming from, but make sure to let him know you trust him and you&#39;re proud of his effforts. I think you are on the right track to building a good relationship with him. It helps me to think of how each situation makes my kids feel. I put myself in their shoes. I try to remember how loved a gift can make them feel. I say yes to every request they make, if it&#39;s within my (wallet) power. It surprises me that they understand if they ask for something and I<br/>
 don&#39;t have the money.<br/>
<br/>
One more piece of advice, I find that there are unschoolers out there who are quick to cut a newbie down. I find there are unschoolers who will be  very kind and supportive of your journey, and there are others who will belittle you for making a mistake. Listen to the postive people:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-624411020">Another consideration is how often he helps when there is no reward.<br/>
I think older siblings, especially when there is a large age gap between the kids, often help out without any recognition offered.<br/>
<br/>
Not that the iPad should be tied to anything. It is a fantastic device and will be great fun (but get a heavy duty case like an Otterbox...accidents happen).<br/>

Admit you made a mistake.  Even if you have not totally internalized that<br/>
you did.   Maybe it&#39;s hard to let lose of feeling you need to &quot;help him<br/>
live up to commitments&quot;   but think hard about whether you are willing to<br/>
pay the price for that.......damaging your relationship with your son.   It<br/>
was your mistake, not his.  There is a reason that minors are not able to<br/>
enter into binding contracts.<br/>

Just switching it to a Christmas gift is not acknowledging that the mistake<br/>
was yours.  Especially if that means &quot;shorting&quot; another planned Christmas<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-850072618">Hi.<br/>
I&#39;m new to the list, but would like to comment on this, hope that&#39;s ok.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
==I am not sure what to say or do in order to have him feel better without giving him something he didn&#39;t earn.==<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the concept of *earning* that I&#39;m thinking of. It&#39;s a very possible roadblock in an unschooling family, I think. Not only because the child can be too young for a task and not realize it, but also because rewards can create a line of  &quot;what&#39;s in it for me&quot; and &quot;he/she owes me&quot; - thinking, instead of just naturally helping out eachother because it&#39;s a nice thing to do and it works both ways. Rewards often acts as manipulators, even when we don&#39;t intend them to.<br/>
<br/>
To avoid situations like this in the future, I&#39;d work hard on eliminating the concept of rewarding from the family. Children will have plenty of occasions to experience *earning* things outside the house. You can keep the aquisition of things separate from helping. Just like not tying chores to allowances ;-)<br/>

<br/>
I created this discussion and have been here for eleven years.  I started unschooling 22 years ago and have been helping other unschoolers since before there were internet discussions.<br/>
<br/>
The advice above is by someone who joined the list eleven days ago.<br/>
<br/>
There is no advantage for me to &quot;cut a newbie down.&quot;<br/>
And there is a HUGE disadvantage for the children of new unschoolers if any experienced unschooler &quot;supports&quot; the mother on her journey and says &quot;good job!&quot; or &quot;I trust you&quot; to a mom who is dragging her feet and is undecided and is taking bad advice.<br/>
<br/>
Some of &quot;the positive people&quot; write things like these:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/support">http://sandradodd.com/support</a><br/>
(Some of the tea-related things I made up.  I cut and pasted the &quot;support.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
-=-It&#39;s very hard to move to unschooling, after years of &quot;traditional&quot; parenting-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s impossible to do so if a person is unwilling to consider that they are doing the very things that will prevent unschooling from working.  When a mom cares more about &quot;her journey&quot; than she does about her child, the child is taking a back seat to the mother&#39;s desire for positive strokes.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-594553514">Thank you for everyone&#39;s input, harsh or not. Unschooling is a completely different lifestyle change for us and a much bigger concept than I could ever have managed to understand when I first came across Sandra&#39;s blog while looking for ways to teach a child that didn&#39;t want to be taught. I&#39;ve read her book, am starting on another, and I seek answers each day because I feel right with unschooling and its been a long road with a bipolar child to find something that feels right.  I&#39;m still fumbling along the way. <br/>
<br/>
I did give him the iPad, apologized, explained where we went wrong and thanked him for being a great big brother and helper. He&#39;s much happier and has spent the entire day playing and downloading apps. It took a bit for my husband to understand, however, because he felt he hadn&#39;t earned it. I sent him all of your responses as they came in and discussed it back and forth and back and forth. He still struggles with the unschooling concept because doesn&#39;t think the kids will learn responsibility. He&#39;s coming around though as he sees how little we struggle with the kids now. <br/>
<br/>
Happy holidays to you and yours. <br/>

&gt; Long story short:<br/>
&gt; We messed up and I&#39;m not sure how to fix it. We offered our 12 year old an iPad in exchange for helping to watch his 4 year old brother for 3 weeks while we worked a Christmas tree lot.  He lasted 1 week before quitting and not helping out at all the final 2 weeks. He did great the first week and it takes 2 weeks for Apple to ship the iPad so I ordered it. It came today and he&#39;s upset that he doesn&#39;t get it, even though we talked about it weeks ago after he quit.  He was upset and crying and wouldn&#39;t talk about it. <br/>
&gt; I am not sure what to say or do in order to have him feel better without giving him something he didn&#39;t earn. I know it was a crappy deal to make and we should never have done it. We are new to unschooling and at times revert to the way we did things in the past. <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll end by saying that we didn&#39;t scold or belittle him when he didn&#39;t fulfill his agreement. He asked of he could still have the iPad and I told him he couldn&#39;t. I was a little surprised when he burst into hysterics tonight, but I guess the site of it made him feel like a failure and that bothers me. <br/>
&gt; P.S. I read all the new member guidelines before posting. :)<br/>

&gt; I created this discussion and have been here for eleven years.  I started unschooling 22 years ago and have been helping other unschoolers since before there were internet discussions.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; There is no advantage for me to &quot;cut a newbie down.&quot;<br/>
&gt; And there is a HUGE disadvantage for the children of new unschoolers if any experienced unschooler &quot;supports&quot; the mother on her journey and says &quot;good job!&quot; or &quot;I trust you&quot; to a mom who is dragging her feet and is undecided and is taking bad advice.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Some of &quot;the positive people&quot; write things like these:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/support">http://sandradodd.com/support</a><br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s impossible to do so if a person is unwilling to consider that they are doing the very things that will prevent unschooling from working.  When a mom cares more about &quot;her journey&quot; than she does about her child, the child is taking a back seat to the mother&#39;s desire for positive strokes.  <br/>

Give him the iPad with love and tell him that you know he did what he could and it was enough.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-991971938">Learning responsibility ... how does that happen?<br/>
<br/>
Mostly, I think it happens by modeling. When &quot;I&quot; am responsible in how I<br/>
behave directly with my children, that&#39;s probably the most powerful<br/>
influence. When I am responsible in front of my kids in how I behave toward<br/>
others - that&#39;s powerful too.<br/>
<br/>
It is SO hard for adults to &quot;get&quot; what is really going on in a kid&#39;s head.<br/>
When an adult punishes a child by withholding something they want, is the<br/>
child thinking, &quot;I deserved not to get that thing. I behaved irresponsibly.<br/>
I should behave more responsibly in the future.&quot; No - the child is off<br/>
furiously thinking, &quot;They are SO unfair. They don&#39;t understand me. They<br/>
don&#39;t even care WHY I did what i did. I HATE them. They said I could have<br/>
it and now they&#39;re breaking their promise. If they think THAT was<br/>
irresponsible, I&#39;ll show them really irresponsible. I&#39;ll run away - that&#39;ll<br/>
show them.&quot; Or, maybe, &quot;I&#39;m so worthless. I can&#39;t do anything right even<br/>
when it is in my own interest. I&#39;m a big loser. My parents don&#39;t think much<br/>
of me. Its not even worth trying anymore.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Not exactly the ideas you probably want to be creating in your child&#39;s mind.<br/>
<br/>
What about: &quot;My parents are so generous. I love them.&quot; &quot;My parents are<br/>
understanding and gentle. I should try to be more like them.&quot; &quot;My parents<br/>
understand me that I&#39;m trying.&quot; &quot;My parents think I&#39;m a good person and I<br/>
will try to live up to that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What actions are your part are most likely to put the second set of ideas<br/>
in your child&#39;s head?<br/>

Others here might be able to clarify or confirm, but I think my book is better for people who know they want to be unschoolers.  For those who are wary of the ideas, maybe Pam Laricchia&#39;s book would be better.  Maybe if your husband reads hers, he&#39;ll be more easily able to appreciate mine. <br/>

She also has a series of introductory e-mails you and your husband might be able to go through as a couple.  It takes a few weeks, at two per week.  They&#39;re very soothing.   You can get to both of those at the link above.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When responsibility is defined as doing what you&#39;re told or what you&#39;re supposed to do, it seems like the only way to get people to do that is to ride on them until that message controls their choices rather than their (*supposedly*) natural evil inclinations to be selfish.<br/>
<br/>
But if responsibility is seen as what we&#39;ve chosen to do to be the people we want to be, it&#39;s easier to see other pathways to it. When we can choose each time to do something, when we can decide what standards to maintain to be who we want to be, when we can decide whether we can continue to provide the standards we require of ourselves or if it&#39;s best passed onto someone else, it&#39;s easier to see how kids can grow into that naturally by having the ability to try things and decide if it&#39;s right for who they are today.<br/>
<br/>
If children&#39;s choices are judged against adult standards the kids will often fail. <br/>
<br/>
What we want isn&#39;t kids whose surface actions match their parents&#39; conscience but people who make choices according to their own conscience. To help kids conscience evolve and grow, feed it through your treatment of them: *be* kind, respectful, patient, helpful, understanding, supportive, trusting. Harshness, anger, disappointment tend to grow those same attitudes in others.<br/>

<br/>
That would be wonderful. I was hoping my husband can come up at least for a day. As a farmer he grew up with required chores and the farmer&#39;s working ethic talk. My kids have no required chores. My 6 year old loves it and will spend all day with dad from Spring till it gets too cold for her in the Fall. My son, 10 years old, will do it  occasionally,sometimes he will get into it , sometimes he is busy doing other things. He has been splitting some wood for me just because. <br/>
When he does help out it is because he wants, or we really need him to help, and he does it willingly and does a great job. He does not cut corners or complain. He is a pretty cool kid. He is just very busy doing his own things in the computer.<br/>
&#39;There is another local dad that I am not sure if he is going but the mom and the younger boys, 11 and 13, are going. They have met Sandra many years ago at a Conference in St Louis. The Dad had doubts   and questions and the Conference, specially listening to Sandra , really got him on board. I think Keith made a big impression in that family too.<br/>
There is yet another very sweet dad of young girls  in the State who is all for unschooling and he is a real nice guy. He would be a great dad to meet. I am hoping they will be there. They did come to a Unschooling Water Park get together I had years ago and I keep in touch with them all the time. They are super sweet and the girls are wonderful.<br/>
There is another dad who told me they want to come who;s kids are all into gaming and such . He seems like a great guy too. I met him in a local homeschooling event  a couple months ago. I know his wife and they are unschoolers. <br/>
I know that for my husband it made a world of difference meeting dad&#39;s like David Waynforth and Ben Lovejoy in person. He also did love the Conference he went and he was there for just a day.<br/>
Here is some from David&#39;s wife<br/>
