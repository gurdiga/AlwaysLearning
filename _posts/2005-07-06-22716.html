<div id="ygrps-yiv-577497211"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;I used to worry strongly about what would happen if I died, when my kids were<br/>
&gt;eight and ten and unschooled.   I was very fearful of leaving the in the<br/>
&gt;lurch partway through   the project.     But as each has turned 14, give <br/>
&gt;or take a<br/>
&gt;year, the whole worry flowed out of me regarding that child.    Each of them<br/>
&gt;blossomed HUGELY right after the rough early puberty, and I think that right<br/>
&gt;at this moment any of them would make it fine without parents.    I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;think the same of the schooled teens I know around me, who are suspicious and<br/>
&gt;resentful of adults, who avoid eye contact and have learned to just say what<br/>
&gt;they have to say to get adults to ignore them too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My kids are, by contrast, direct and cheery, honest and responsible.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Often I&#39;ll look at them through the lens of something I&#39;m reading about or<br/>
&gt;thinking, or a period   movie I&#39;ve watched.   Could the boys be sailors or<br/>
&gt;soldiers in they were in another place and time?   Easily.   They would be <br/>
&gt;among<br/>
&gt;the best, if they had good reason to go and do those things.   Either of <br/>
&gt;them,<br/>
&gt;right now, would make good parents.    Holly&#39;s still a little young, at <br/>
&gt;13, but<br/>
&gt;there are times in which she&#39;d&#39;ve been in the early stages of arranged<br/>
&gt;marriages, and could she do that?   Yes.   She&#39;s physically young, but she&#39;s<br/>
&gt;emotionally and mentally more aware of social issues and human factors <br/>
&gt;than many<br/>
&gt;adults, and she&#39;s not thinking maybe she understands it, she knows she has <br/>
&gt;some<br/>
&gt;clear understandings.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;She knows.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That feeling of fakery and fraud that people have talked about for the past<br/>
&gt;few decades seems absent in these kids.   What they don&#39;t know doesn&#39;t scare<br/>
&gt;them, and what they do know is solid.<br/>

there on the list of those I&#39;ll remember.   I love getting these reassurances!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-821133925">**I liked the accidental discoveries of things next to what I was <br/>
looking for.**<br/>
<br/>
I found a new way to make accidental discoveries.  We can make online <br/>
requests to reserve library books, and they are set out for us on <br/>
special shelves, alphabetized by the name of the library patron who <br/>
requested them.  The people next to me in the alphabet often have cool <br/>
things, leading me to moan &quot;why didn&#39;t I request that?&quot;.  But I get good <br/>
ideas for future request.  Of course, what I run across here tends to be <br/>
stuff that&#39;s popular, not stuff that&#39;s obscure and untouched.  A <br/>
different charm.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1011067759">And the cards were often tannish, either manila card stock or aging to brown. <br/>
They matched the furniture, in the older days.<br/>
<br/>
I liked them, though. I liked the accidental discoveries of things next to <br/>
what I was looking for.<br/>

What about the smell of the cards?  I remember the smell.<br/>
