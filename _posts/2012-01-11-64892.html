Someone had posted that when she first came around she was bothered that we didn&#39;t just tell her exactly what to do.  Not those exact words.  I responded that I was glad she had written that because at the next ALL Unschooling Symposium I had been planning to have a panel discussion on people complaining about the times they had asked &quot;a simple question&quot; and people had given them other kinds of suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
It might have been on facebook.  It might&#39;ve been here.<br/>
Anyone recognize it?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-876274138">It is in the Radical Unschooling Info group on Facebook. Looks like it was posted this past Monday. Sorry I can&#39;t post a link now as Logan is using my computer and I&#39;m nursing Gibson. <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>

In another thread here, Leslie Whitney wrote something really good, and particularly useful to me: <br/>
<br/>
-=-in a chat i remember being asked if i thought that unschoolers came from a different planet. in the beginning it seems like it, especially when experienced ones seem to have all the answers, although none seemed to be exactly the answer i was looking for. they were &quot;getting&quot; some thing i just couldn&#39;t completely wrap my brain around. i believe it is Sandra that gives the advise, read a little, do a little. boy has hat been helpful and exactly what i am doing. -=-<br/>
<br/>
This coming December, there will be a panel discussion at the Always Learning Live symposium (you can subscribe to the blog already, though not much info is there yet:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://allunschooling2012.blogspot.com/">http://allunschooling2012.blogspot.com/</a> ), and the topic of the panel will be something like &quot;You didn&#39;t answer the question I asked.&quot; So I&#39;m glad Leslie gave me something for my collection. :-) <br/>
<br/>
If others have examples or saved links to times someone got frustrated because we wouldn&#39;t answer a simple question with a simple answer, bring them on. Thanks!<br/>

And for anyone here wanting to see photos of what happened at this year&#39;s symposium, they&#39;re linked from the-blog-of-the-last-one:<br/>

<br/>
There were 93 people altogether (one was unable to attend at the last minute, but everyone else made it and it was a long way for some of them--England, New Hampshire, New York, Ottowa...)<br/>
<br/>
Next Year&#39;s can&#39;t be too much bigger, because of space considerations, so if you&#39;re interested maybe start stashing airfare money back now.  If you change your mind later or it sells out, you&#39;ll have some saved-up money.  Either way&#39;s a win. :-)<br/>
