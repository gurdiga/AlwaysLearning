<div id="ygrps-yiv-1610049593">In our state we are required to have the kids take a standardized test every other year (3, 5, 7,9, and 11).  This is our year (first time) and I&#39;m a bit nervous for them.

Have you had your kids take a standardized test?  How did they do?  Did you prepare ahead of time.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-206297993">We&#39;re required, in our state, to test or assess every year.  Because I don&#39;t want to involve certificated teachers in our lives, we choose to be in compliance with our laws by using the standardized tests.  (Generally, we&#39;ve used the CAT-Survey available from Seton Hall, so the scores are sent only to us).<br/>
<br/>
We do not prepare for the tests.  We use the test that corresponds with the age-grade that our children would be in were they in school (age minus 5).  <br/>
<br/>
We generally stick the scores away in the file cabinet when they come in, and sometimes don&#39;t bother to open them.  We&#39;re required to test, not to submit scores, or pay any attention to them.  So that&#39;s what we do.<br/>
<br/>
Curiousity got the best of me the first few years, so I snuck a peek.  I&#39;m sometimes really surprised that they score so well, and I&#39;m often surprised when they &quot;clean up&quot; on subjects I didn&#39;t think they knew anything about.  <br/>

Do you know what kind of scores they are required to achieve?  In our state<br/>
they only need to score in the 25th percentile or better to be considered<br/>
adequate.  And if they do happen to score below the 25th percentile, we<br/>
would be on &quot;probation&quot; for the following year and have to show a certain<br/>
level of improvement on the next test.<br/>
<br/>
The whole testing and measuring up process generally sounds much scarier<br/>
than it actually is.  <br/>

<br/>
Are unschoolers learning on a similar curve as others?  &quot;They&quot; (meaning the school administrators) say that a 3rd grader should be learning multiplication or a 4th grader needs to be able to spell this word or that. If &quot;they&quot; are right, then unschoolers would be able to well on these tests.  I just wondered what other&#39;s experience was in this area.<br/>
<br/>
I found out that the child only needs to be in the 13th percentile or higher - gee, that&#39;ll be hard. NOT.  So I no longer am concerned about having my child learn to fill in the bubbles, but I am still curious about how other unschoolers do on those tests.  I include ACT and SAT on that list, too.</div>

<br/>
Well lots of public schooled kids do horribly on the tests, even those  <br/>
who know the material somewhat, because some people don&#39;t test well.<br/>
Others are great guessers and can pass tests on things they know  <br/>
little to nothing about because they can spot the bad answers.<br/>
<br/>
There are statistics on the scores of homeschoolers, but there aren&#39;t  <br/>
stats on unschoolers&#39; scores separately.<br/>
<br/>
In the days when New Mexico required three tests over the school  <br/>
years, some parents would register the kid for third grade twice, and  <br/>
then skip to fifth (when 4th grade was one of the testing years, for  <br/>
example).  Some would just not show up for the testing, or when there  <br/>
was an option for people to order tests and have them administered by  <br/>
a teacher or counsellor, they could get the test and not have to look  <br/>
at or turn in the scores.   The law just said they had to take the  <br/>
test, not report the results.<br/>
<br/>

There are no stats.  It will be different for different kids.  If you  <br/>
can avoid the tests, there are reasons to do so. Please check with  <br/>
locals to see what your practical options are.  Many people believe or  <br/>
are told that tests are required when there are options.<br/>
<br/>
Knowing the test scores can and does change the attitude of the adults  <br/>
and their perceptions of their children, whether the scores are high,  <br/>
low or average.<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re going to take a test, briefing them on the way the tests  <br/>
are to be marked is good.  There are some stories at this link:<br/>

&gt; standardized tests, even though they aren&#39;t beaten with the specific<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First, does the test score mean anything at all?  Will your state board of education send officials to your home if your kids do not make a certain score?<br/>
<br/>
My local public elementary school begins preparing students for the standardized tests about 2 months before the test date.  I was floored.  My youngest daughter happened to be in school at that time and she said it was all they talked about in class.  The school sent home worksheets and online links to practice for the test.  My dd didn&#39;t want to do them.  No one asked about that practice.  She took the test and said it was really no big deal and was fairly stupid.  It did have some questions she didn&#39;t know because she hadn&#39;t studied those topics.  The teacher told me Allie did fine.  And that was it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Are unschoolers learning on a similar curve as others?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I certainly hope not.  Well, I know my children are learning at home and schooled kids are learning/being schooled in school, but I have absolutely no desire to keep up with the school&#39;s scope & sequence.  I know homeschoolers like me who just don&#39;t really care how my children compare to other kids.  The scores are absolutely meaningless because I will not teach to the test either to prepare for the test or to strengthen weak points found by the results.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I include ACT and SAT on that list, too.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Taking standardized tests in K - 12 is completely different than taking the SAT and ACT tests to meet college requirements.  The former is mandatory and the latter voluntary.  My 17 year old dd chose to take the SAT next month to see how well she can do.  There are workbooks full of tips, strategies, and practice questions that will prepare her for these tests.  I do not believe schoolers have an advantage over unschoolers, mostly because I think when an unschooler chooses to take these tests, or do anything else for that matter, he/she is making an informed personal decision.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When Zoe took the SATs, this is what I worried about the most. That I  <br/>
- being schooled and growing up with that mindset - would be most  <br/>
affected. What we concentrated on, for both of us, was viewing the  <br/>
test as only a test of what is on that particular test, not anything  <br/>
broader. Oh, except maybe a test of how you are as a test-taker. FI,  <br/>
it&#39;s clear that if you are a fast reader, you have a big advantage.  <br/>
But it doesn&#39;t mean anything about how you actually comprehend the  <br/>
readings.<br/>
<br/>
And I think that is truly the way to see all standardized tests.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know.  The tests are taken by both schooled and homeschooled (and<br/>
probably some unschooled) children, and the results are not broken down by<br/>
group so there&#39;s really nothing to measure their individual results against.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t tell my children their scores, and I only glance at the composite to<br/>
make sure it is over the 25th percentile and send it on to the school board.<br/>
The scores don&#39;t really mean anything to me, and I don&#39;t want them to mean<br/>
anything to my kids either.  They&#39;re only a means to an end, to enable us to<br/>
get our &quot;permission letter&quot; for another year of hassle-free homeschooling.<br/>

and then watch your thoughts.  You can do it!  Thousands of people  <br/>
have done it.<br/>

<br/>
Double check that, as recommended before.  Check with locals.<br/>
And I shudder when someone thinks of this as a support group.  We&#39;re  <br/>
not going to support you through having your kids tested.  I&#39;m not  <br/>
even wanting to support talking about it anymore.  You need to check  <br/>
with local unschoolers, and discuss it there, with them, not here with  <br/>
Australians and Canadians and people from several states with no test  <br/>
requirements at all.<br/>

I know.  It wouldn&#39;t be good or right, though, for me (as the list  <br/>
owner) to leave a mushy &quot;thanks for the support&quot; note there when it&#39;s  <br/>
commonly stated on this list that it&#39;s not a support list, but a  <br/>
discussion list.  Some people&#39;s needs are well supported by  <br/>
discussions!  Certainly if people want brainstorming there are fewer  <br/>
better places in the world than this list; I&#39;m serious.   But what  <br/>
most people mean by &quot;support&quot; is agreement, sympathy, encouragement to  <br/>
keep doing what one&#39;s already doing.  Teaparty cooing stuff.   And  <br/>
that&#39;s neither the purpose nor the practice of this list.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Sorry to offend. Subject dropped.-=-<br/>
