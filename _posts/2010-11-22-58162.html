<div id="ygrps-yiv-732693399">I recently re-connected with my sister after a falling out.<br/>
I&#39;m glad she is back in my life, the break was good for both of us.<br/>
<br/>
We have different views about parenting, and she had a few things to say to me today that I would like to run by all of you.<br/>
<br/>
Logan, who will be 4 on 12/4, sometimes says hello and goodby to people, sometimes not.<br/>
<br/>
This bothers my sister. She says it hurts people&#39;s feelings, and it&#39;s our job as parents to teach him manners because that is part of living in our culture. I get that, but he is sometimes uncomforatable talking to people he does not see that often, and we don&#39;t push it.<br/>
<br/>
We were at a family gathering last week:<br/>
<br/>
Part I<br/>
Logan had his Mr. Potato Head, and Olivia wanted to play with it with him.<br/>
He said no. I asked Olivia if she would like to play a game on my iphone instead, she did.<br/>
Of course Logan wanted the iphone soon after, but I told him that Olivia was playing with it, and he could have a turn next.<br/>
All seemed well.<br/>
My sister, Alison told me today that she thinks I should have told Logan if he did not share the toy that nobody would get to play with it. I thought things were cool because both kids were happy, but Alison said that Olivia always shares with Logan, and he is not learning that he can&#39;t have everything his way. <br/>
He has been very good with sharing his toys as he is getting older most of the time.<br/>
He adores Olivia, and really missed her when my sister and I were estranged.<br/>
<br/>
Part II<br/>
Logan did give Alison and Olivia big hugs hello, but he did not say goodbye when we left.<br/>
I was so thrilled that he hugged my sister hello, (very unusual for him), that I did not think <br/>
it was a big deal that he did not say goodbye. He was tired and fell asleep as soon as we got in the car.<br/>
Today I was told me that Olivia&#39;s feelings were hurt that Logan did not say goodbye to her. <br/>
I feel bad that she was hurt, my sister and her husband are going through an ugly break-up, and I don&#39;t want to add to Olivia&#39;s upset. She is a sensitive, sweet girl.<br/>
<br/>
The last bit I got from Alison is that she is really worried that Logan will not have friends because he isn&#39;t polite or respectful.<br/>
She also said that I could at least work with him on this with family, people that we love.<br/>
He already has some friends who he loves and plays well with.<br/>
He even considers his friend&#39;s parents his friends too because he loves talking to them and they really seem to get him.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to do him a disservice in the world.<br/>
How do you all feel about hello and goodbye, and sharing?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Meryl</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1365754432">You can say goodbye on his behalf when he is feeling tired or shy.  He may<br/>
echo it back or wave or give some sign of acknowledgement--he may not.<br/>
<br/>
Here is another way to look at sharing...<br/>
1. Would you lend anyone your car?  For a day?  A week?  How about 6 months?<br/>
Or a year?<br/>
2.  If your sister asked you for 5 000 dollar would you just hand it over?<br/>
 How come you aren&#39;t sharing? How about if she wanted to borrow your house<br/>
for a year or two?<br/>
<br/>
When adults are asked to share things that are important to them they find<br/>
it easier to say &quot;no&quot;, though they cannot accept that children have things<br/>
that are important to them and also should have some choice about what those<br/>
things are that they feel they cannot share.  If your child never shares you<br/>
may want to help him figure it out.  However if your child sometimes shares<br/>
its fine.  My kids found sharing food, no matter how coveted or how much of<br/>
a treat it was easier than beloved toys.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-814943197">***Today I was told me that Olivia&#39;s feelings were hurt that Logan did not say <br/>
goodbye to her. ***<br/>
<br/>
Did she say goodbye to him?  When guests leave our house, we all make a point of <br/>
saying goodbye.  It helps people leave happier, especially little kids.  At 4, I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have expected an answer either way, but as the host, I would have said <br/>
a hello and goodbye special just for him.  I put the onus on me in social <br/>
situations, especially with kids.  I&#39;m the adult.  If Olivia had said goodbye <br/>
and Logan ignored her, as his parent, I would have said something like, &quot;Logan <br/>
seems tired, I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll miss you, and we&#39;ll see you again soon.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
As far as sharing, I wouldn&#39;t ever force a 4 yr old to share a toy they were <br/>
already playing with.  I might suggest taking turns.  Or, as it played out, he <br/>
wanted something that the other child had a bit later on, at that point I might <br/>
have suggested trading play things.  If the goal is happy kids playing nicely, <br/>
then there are lots of ways to accomplish that.  Taking a toy away and refusing <br/>
to let anyone play with it, doesn&#39;t accomplish that goal if it makes a child <br/>
unhappy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1698156032">hello group, i been on this list a while. i know I am a lurker and always in<br/>
the shadows reaping in all the great advice. But i wanted to ask about the<br/>
goodbye thing and share something a friend said to me about why she never<br/>
says goodbye to anyone and she is an adult.<br/>
<br/>
have you asked Logan why he doesn&#39;t say goodbye? was it just that one time,<br/>
or always? with one person or everyone? maybe his not wanting to say goodbye<br/>
just needs to be validated allowing him the ok?<br/>
<br/>
reason i say this is because a long time child hood friend told me she never<br/>
ever says goodbye, i never realized it until recently. when i asked her why,<br/>
she says she never does, she feels that saying goodbye to someone seems like<br/>
its forever. as if she will never see them again. they will never return. so<br/>
she will tell you see you soon, or see you later, or something like that,<br/>
but never goodbye, or something that even sounds like it. i used to know<br/>
another person like that a long time ago, now that i think of it more, but i<br/>
can&#39;t remember whom that is lol.<br/>
<br/>
as for the sharing thing, i feel the same way a some others feel. you<br/>
offered the little girl your phone and the girl was happy with that, if the<br/>
girl was not im sure you would have recieved some sort of vibes from that.<br/>
maybe mom is using the childs &quot;feelings&quot; as an excuse to have her say as to<br/>
how your raising your child?  logan should be respected in the sense that he<br/>
should not be expected to share every single thing he has, and neither<br/>
should the girl, yes it is nice for others, but is it validating the childs<br/>
own rights as to what it is they really want?<br/>

We barely speak to my brother-in-law (who does not have kids) because he thinks <br/>
Logan is rude and anti-social.***<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know why this is so often true.  Many adults expect kids to behave like <br/>
mini adults.  Kids are still learning social cues, some easier than others on <br/>
that front.  Even so, I don&#39;t always say &quot;good bye&quot;, sometimes I leave if there <br/>
is a window to leave and will send a text or email or give a quick call a bit <br/>
later saying that I was sorry I hadn&#39;t said good bye.  That usually only happens <br/>
in group situations.  <br/>
<br/>
With family, we have prolonged good bye rituals that involve the host family <br/>
members doing exaggerated waves from the front steps to wave the leaving car <br/>
good bye.  Everyone in the car waves back until we no longer see each other. <br/>
 It&#39;s just what we do.  If a kid doesn&#39;t say good bye, they can wave from the <br/>
car.  That might be a lot of fanfare, but it&#39;s fun and it makes for happy good <br/>
bye&#39;s.  The good bye is an implied gesture from everyone in the whole, not put <br/>
upon a single person, adult or child.<br/>
<br/>
It bothers me that there are adults who expect kids to meet their level and then <br/>
are disappointed with the kids for not doing so.  We try to avoid those kinds of <br/>
adults!  Adults should meet the child where they are at, in general.  However <br/>
since those kinds of adults exist, our kids must find ways to deal or not deal <br/>
with them, and as parents we can help by being a buffer.<br/>
<br/>
I personally think it&#39;s rude and anti-social for an adult to have expectations <br/>
of children that aren&#39;t even remotely developmentally appropriate.  I assume <br/>
it&#39;s because they weren&#39;t treated kindly as a child and forget what it&#39;s like to <br/>
BE a child.  Sometimes I remind adults like that about how they felt meeting <br/>
strangers or relatives they didn&#39;t see often as a child.<br/>
<br/>
I remember clearly how I felt in those circumstances.  I felt both shy and happy <br/>
to see people that I liked but didn&#39;t see often.  It always took a few hours to <br/>
warm up and get in the groove of those connections.  It took adults being <br/>
friendly and kind and welcoming.<br/>

<br/>
My sister has judged my first-born and our parenting style from my eldest&#39;s birth.  I totally relate to the desire to have one&#39;s child unconditionally loved.  Just because one has family does not guarantee that all family members know how to love unconditionally.  I prefer my children (and my hubby and myself) maintain boundaries we are comfortable with our family as well as others.  As a result, we recognize that each one of us chooses what actions we take (hellos, goodbyes and sharing).  If others around us are affected in a way that merits discussion, there&#39;s always room for acknowledgment and discussion, but I cannot choose for my daughter what she will say (hello/goodbye) or feel/do (share).  As it turns out, my eldest prefers to say, &quot;See you soon,&quot; -- she hates goodbyes.  And when she shares (she&#39;s 4), it&#39;s because she really wants to share, not because she has been pressured to share by others&#39; expectations.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1880100432">-=-We were at a family gathering last week:<br/>
<br/>
Part I<br/>
Logan had his Mr. Potato Head, and Olivia wanted to play with it with  <br/>
him.<br/>
He said no.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t let my kids take things out of the house that they weren&#39;t  <br/>
willing to share.  If they had something like a gameboy, for the  <br/>
journey, we locked it in the car safely, for the way home.  We would  <br/>
always choose things that could be shared, when going to be with other  <br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
-=-my sister and her husband are going through an ugly break-up,-=-<br/>
<br/>
Your estrangement from your sister, and her breakup with her  <br/>
husband...  Do they have to do with her being too critical and  <br/>
controlling?  Because if so, it might be a kindness to her to mention  <br/>
that, if you can do so in a nice way.  Maybe your sister needs to  <br/>
practice getting along with other people, and work on being more  <br/>
accepting of people&#39;s differences.<br/>
<br/>
That said, though, I think it&#39;s good to coach kids on courtesies.<br/>
<br/>
-=-The last bit I got from Alison is that she is really worried that  <br/>
Logan will not have friends because he isn&#39;t polite or respectful.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a reasonable concern, but was she &quot;really worried&quot; or was she  <br/>
trying to manipulate you into doing things her way?<br/>
<br/>
I do think some unschooled kids could use better manners, and that  <br/>
some unschooling parents go too far toward &quot;whatever&quot; and some nearly  <br/>
seem to encourage their children to do the opposite of what the  <br/>
parents were &quot;made to do.&quot;  In our own family, that was never a  <br/>
consideration at all.  Someone recently said to me, about a gift I had  <br/>
bought for Holly, that it was like what a lot of girls were wearing,  <br/>
and then said oh, but you&#39;re unschoolers so you probably want her to  <br/>
wear something that&#39;s not like what the other girls wear.   I  <br/>
understood the comment in context, but it was awkward, and NOT the way  <br/>
I think, or Holly thinks.  Different for the sake of being different  <br/>
isn&#39;t any requirement of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
The opposite of &quot;do everything that&#39;s expected&quot; might be &quot;do NOTHING  <br/>
that&#39;s expected.&quot;<br/>
We shouldn&#39;t be living by rules, nor by an opposite version of the  <br/>
rules.  That&#39;s reactionary.<br/>
Replacing rules with new rules isn&#39;t living by principles.  There are  <br/>
expectations of visitors and hosts.  Pretending there aren&#39;t is a  <br/>
disservice.  A child can say something or wave, or smile, or  <br/>
SOMEthing, without being forced to &quot;say goodbye.&quot;  The principle of  <br/>
acknowledging another person (saying hi, or introducing oneself) and  <br/>
of some sort of &quot;had a nice time&quot; or &quot;glad to see you&quot; at the end is  <br/>
not a big deal.  If the parents model it and make suggestions to the  <br/>
child of things he might say, whey might a child NOT want to do that?   <br/>
It doesn&#39;t make sense to me.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids were little and first started going to birthday parties  <br/>
or play dates where I might not be, I said it was nice, when they  <br/>
left, to say something like &quot;thanks for inviting me.&quot;  And because I  <br/>
told them why, and suggested some words, they jumped on it and did it  <br/>
and still do such things.<br/>
<br/>
I think the expectations should meet in the middle, the sister wanting  <br/>
&quot;all&quot; and the other sister being willing to defend &quot;none.&quot;<br/>

Sometimes small children don&#39;t like to say goodbye when they are tired; I&#39;ve<br/>

That&#39;s what we did too.  I&#39;d remind Dylan that the other kid would probably <br/>

***Logan, who will be 4 on 12/4, sometimes says hello and goodbye to people, <br/>

<br/>
Three is really little.  I don&#39;t know why an adult would expect a three year <br/>
old to always say hello and goodbye.<br/>
And I don&#39;t think a three year old can be expected to know why he might not <br/>
say it.<br/>
<br/>
***told me that Olivia&#39;s feelings were hurt that Logan did not say goodbye <br/>
to her. ***<br/>
<br/>
If the mom, who ought to know better, is making a big deal of it I&#39;d guess <br/>
some of Olivia&#39;s hurt feelings were coached.   How old is Olivia?   Next <br/>
time you see her maybe you can tell her Logan has lots of fun with her and <br/>
you&#39;ll say goodbye on Logan&#39;s behalf until he remembers to say it.   I bet <br/>
Olivia will understand.<br/>
<br/>
Your sister&#39;s going through a rough time but I&#39;d still tell her to chill. <br/>
He&#39;s three.   Three is really young to expect generous sharing and perfect <br/>
social skills.  Four is really young, too.<br/>

If the goal and purpose is for him to say good bye, maybe.  But if the  <br/>
goal and purpose is to have a good time, and sleep is healthy, then  <br/>
staying until he&#39;s sleepy could be a Good thing! :-)<br/>
<br/>
I always loved when little-guy Kirby would play and play and play and  <br/>
then sleep in the car on the way home.  Often he would be crying and  <br/>
objecting when it was time to go, and I would carry him out while I  <br/>
said &quot;I think this means he had a really good time!&quot; and when he woke  <br/>
up from sleeping it off, he would tell me how much fun it was.  And I  <br/>
would pass some of the details back to the mom at the other house, the  <br/>
good things he said, and that seemed to balance his seeming rudeness  <br/>
at the end there.<br/>
<br/>
And as he got older I would make suggestions of what he might say, and  <br/>
he picked up some things from what I was saying for him.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby (now 24) called me just a bit ago, and I talked to him while I  <br/>
was on my way to take something to Holly (19).   Being sweet to them  <br/>
when they&#39;re little, and helping them understand the purpose of  <br/>
courtesy, will pay off for you and for them, and for  the relationship  <br/>
between you later.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1108489403"> <br/>
The discussion on saying hello and goodbye has prompted me to ask for some <br/>
advise of my own-please!<br/>
 <br/>
My 4.11 yo son is highly sensitive, It will take him a long time to feel <br/>
comfortable to talk to  anyone new or that we only see in irregular brief <br/>
moments-(i.e a neighbour),or good friends when the situation is too much for <br/>
him- sometimes Grandparents too.<br/>
 <br/>
I am a single Mama and together we talk deeply about many things including this- <br/>
at times I have suggested he may like to say Hello or Goodbye- He explains to me <br/>
that he would like to speak to some people but finds it really hard. I can tell <br/>
just by looking at him in the situation and talking afterwards that this is so <br/>
true. Hence I have never pushed him to do so.( except perhaps at times when I <br/>
know for sure he is comfortable but just forgetting, and at his young age not so <br/>
used to the social cues I.e after an afternoon spent happily talking non-stop at <br/>
Grandads-Or just the two of us arriving to great nans who he will talk to <br/>
endlessly in which case  after a gentle reminder of &quot;would you like to say <br/>
hello/goodbye he is happy and very natural to do so)<br/>
 <br/>
I might add when we are at child orientated things, with other children he does <br/>
not know very well or at all or when the person is very kind and obviously <br/>
child-friendly, he is still sensitive and takes his time, but will within half <br/>
an hour or so can be confident to chat and play with them, with me and sometimes <br/>
without.<br/>
 <br/>
In the situations we come across, the problem for us is not my sons lack of <br/>
conversation ( i am sure for him things will gradually become easier- with <br/>
patience, love and time for him to fiond his way,  but -what I can say to those <br/>
people, until he does, who give me and even HIM the unkind looks as if to say - <br/>
How rude he is- Is his mother not going to tell him to answer me- etc etc.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Especially my sister who we very very rarely see, don&#39;t get on with at all and <br/>
is one who strongly feels children MUST answer an adult when spoken to, In the <br/>
past she has been very rude to my little boy ( no wonder he never speaks to <br/>
her!) asking him &quot;Hello is anybody in there&quot; when he hasn&#39;t said hello back.<br/>
<br/>
Without causing conflict at my parents this Christmas when we visit- (my sister <br/>
will be there)or anywhere else with anyone, I would like to come up with a <br/>
response to people who seem offended, appalled or who feel the need to bully my <br/>
young son when he does not feel comfortable to talk to them.<br/>
 <br/>
Any suggestions please?<br/>
 <br/>
Many thanks <br/>
Jodie<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1502778865">Hi Jodie my 8.5 yr old dd is like your son as well she has always had a problem meeting people and in saying hello and goodbye until she is comfortable, I was also the same when I was younger and I was made to speak to people even yelled at and smacked if I didn&#39;t so I don&#39;t push it with my dd I encourage her but let her know it&#39;s ok she will find her comfort zone soon and she generally does my family are finally realising it is better to leave her and let her come to them when she is ready but it has taken them along time to realise this. I do have to remind myself at times not to constantly say to kid&#39;s &quot;say hello&quot; as those words are imprinted in me and I do forget at times.<br/>
<br/>
I think alot of people need to be more aware of sensitive people I personally have problems alot of the time in group situations because of the way I was always made to talk to people so I am hoping by changing the pattern with my dd she will grow up into a much more confident person in her own time naturally just by me gently encouraging her to take her time and interact when she is ready.<br/>

when I know he`s not comfy with it.<br/>
I have always felt strongly that I don`t want to say something on his behalf if <br/>
he dosn`t mean it, or make something up.<br/>
And by asking aloud if he would like me to answer and how -it may help people to <br/>
understand us rather than frown at us and be rude.<br/>
I am cofident myself so dont mind funny looks coming my way- just want to <br/>

<br/>
If he has chosen to say nothing and there is an awkward pause and silence that <br/>
warrants someone to say something, then you can say what you feel is best to <br/>
say.  In a sense, he&#39;s given up his choice of words by NOT saying them.  If he&#39;d <br/>
like to be heard and you say something on his behalf that he didn&#39;t want said, <br/>
then he should speak up.  Until he&#39;s ready to voice his words, then he&#39;ll need <br/>
to accept what others say on his behalf.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter did that for years.  I&#39;d turn to her and say what I think <br/>
she&#39;d like me to say and add &quot;is that right?&quot; and then she could nod or shake <br/>
her head to confirm or deny what I&#39;ve said on her behalf.  Mostly I got it right <br/>
because I know my daughter really well.  Eventually she started talking to <br/>
people.  It started happening when she was around the age of 7/8.  Up until that <br/>
point she wouldn&#39;t say a word to any stranger ever, even if she&#39;d met them a few <br/>
times or knew them by being familiar with them, like neighbors or the grocery <br/>
clerk that is always there.<br/>

SOMEthing, without being forced to &quot;say goodbye.&quot; The principle of<br/>

not a big deal. If the parents model it and make suggestions to the<br/>

It doesn&#39;t make sense to me.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids were little and first started going to birthday parties<br/>
or play dates where I might not be, I said it was nice, when they<br/>
left, to say something like &quot;thanks for inviting me.&quot; And because I<br/>
told them why, and suggested some words, they jumped on it and did it<br/>
and still do such things.**<br/>
<br/>
Sandra,<br/>
This is very helpful for me.<br/>
We do model polite behavior for Logan.<br/>
When we&#39;ve explained that<br/>
saying hello/goodbye or something like it is a nice thing to do, and makes others <br/>
happy, sometimes he does not want to do it. He has growled at some people, family even, when they try to talk with him. I know it can be very off-putting, and then there are times where he&#39;ll chat it up with a complete stranger on the subway. When I&#39;ve asked him about both of these things, he might say, &quot;Because I was/wasn&#39;t in the mood to talk to them.&quot;, or &quot;I liked/didn&#39;t like her voice&quot;.<br/>
We will just keep at it in a loving way. I have noticed him opening up more as he gets older.<br/>
<br/>
As for the question about my sister, yes she can be controlling, and mean, but that is not the reason we were estranged...this time. It had to do with childhood hurts, and her wanting time to work through them. She was really as loving as she could be in her delivery, this was new for her, so I was more open to the conversation.<br/>
Of course she has a part in the end of her marriage, but her husband is an abusive drinker, that&#39;s the main reason. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m supposed to bewith my sister and mom on Thanksgiving without my husband, who has to work. I want to have this time with my family, and yet part of me wants to avoid all the stuff that might come up, and just stay home.<br/>
And, I will discuss with Logan that if he wants to bring toys, they need to be something that he is willing to share with his cousin.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Your estrangement from your sister, and her breakup with her  <br/>
&gt; husband...  Do they have to do with her being too critical and  <br/>
&gt; controlling?  Because if so, it might be a kindness to her to mention  <br/>
&gt; that, if you can do so in a nice way.  Maybe your sister needs to  <br/>
&gt; practice getting along with other people, and work on being more  <br/>
&gt; accepting of people&#39;s differences.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That said, though, I think it&#39;s good to coach kids on courtesies.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-The last bit I got from Alison is that she is really worried that  <br/>
&gt; Logan will not have friends because he isn&#39;t polite or respectful.-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s a reasonable concern, but was she &quot;really worried&quot; or was she  <br/>
&gt; trying to manipulate you into doing things her way?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I do think some unschooled kids could use better manners, and that  <br/>
&gt; some unschooling parents go too far toward &quot;whatever&quot; and some nearly  <br/>
&gt; seem to encourage their children to do the opposite of what the  <br/>
&gt; parents were &quot;made to do.&quot;  In our own family, that was never a  <br/>
&gt; consideration at all.  Someone recently said to me, about a gift I had  <br/>
&gt; bought for Holly, that it was like what a lot of girls were wearing,  <br/>
&gt; and then said oh, but you&#39;re unschoolers so you probably want her to  <br/>
&gt; wear something that&#39;s not like what the other girls wear.   I  <br/>
&gt; understood the comment in context, but it was awkward, and NOT the way  <br/>
&gt; I think, or Holly thinks.  Different for the sake of being different  <br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t any requirement of unschooling.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The opposite of &quot;do everything that&#39;s expected&quot; might be &quot;do NOTHING  <br/>
&gt; that&#39;s expected.&quot;<br/>
&gt; We shouldn&#39;t be living by rules, nor by an opposite version of the  <br/>
&gt; rules.  That&#39;s reactionary.<br/>
&gt; Replacing rules with new rules isn&#39;t living by principles.  There are  <br/>
&gt; expectations of visitors and hosts.  Pretending there aren&#39;t is a  <br/>
&gt; disservice.  A child can say something or wave, or smile, or  <br/>
&gt; SOMEthing, without being forced to &quot;say goodbye.&quot;  The principle of  <br/>
&gt; acknowledging another person (saying hi, or introducing oneself) and  <br/>
&gt; of some sort of &quot;had a nice time&quot; or &quot;glad to see you&quot; at the end is  <br/>
&gt; not a big deal.  If the parents model it and make suggestions to the  <br/>
&gt; child of things he might say, whey might a child NOT want to do that?   <br/>
&gt; It doesn&#39;t make sense to me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When my kids were little and first started going to birthday parties  <br/>
&gt; or play dates where I might not be, I said it was nice, when they  <br/>
&gt; left, to say something like &quot;thanks for inviting me.&quot;  And because I  <br/>
&gt; told them why, and suggested some words, they jumped on it and did it  <br/>
&gt; and still do such things.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think the expectations should meet in the middle, the sister wanting  <br/>
&gt; &quot;all&quot; and the other sister being willing to defend &quot;none.&quot;<br/>

If you went to an indoor play-place, or someone else&#39;s house, or playing with communal sand-toys at the park (and forgot to bring your own that time?  I&#39;ve found that there has to be a balance between what I would want to do ideally, and what other parents and children expect from all children who interact with their children.  I feel like, in order to maintain relationships, or ability to use certain services, I find myself explaining reasons for taking turns and sharing, and consequences to relationships of not sharing, or being asked to leave the play-place.  Sometimes, those things don&#39;t work, and my 4.5 year old still doesn&#39;t want to share something, and neither child will be drawn away to other toys or distractions, and it seems to me like a huge tantrum or fight over the toy is not realistic in that place with those people, and I do say, &quot;Temima, each child is going to have a turn,&quot; and I often turns on a timer or something to mark time and give each child turns.  She seems to accept that best.  It doesn&#39;t happen so often, or I would limit those kinds of outings if possible.  It doesn&#39;t seem fair to me to make the other child not have access to a certain toy at all because I don&#39;t enforce sharing, if the situation develops where the two really only want that one toy at the same time.  Does this sound like a good way of dealing with these kinds of situations?   <br/>

I think so.<br/>

If a mother decides her child doesn&#39;t have to share a toy, it&#39;s the  <br/>
same as the child deciding.  But it&#39;s worse in a public place, because  <br/>
if sharing is expected [or required by law, perhaps... :-) ] the  <br/>
mother doesn&#39;t have the right to make decisions about those resources  <br/>
based on her own philosophy or what she considers to be ideal.<br/>
<br/>
In her own yard with her own swing, sure.  Public playground, public  <br/>
swing, the city ultimately decides.  The swing belongs to them (or the  <br/>
housing complex, or somebody).  In the absence of the owner coming and  <br/>
throwing one family out, though, they probably assume people will be  <br/>
courteous and share.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking through some of these issues myself so have been following your thread with interest. <br/>
<br/>
I come from a tight-knit Caribbean family where extended family tends to be very involved in parenting in what I would call a &#39;parenting partnership&#39;. It makes me wonder if you could apply some of the principles of &#39;spousal partnerships&#39; to your relationship with your sister? <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/spouses">http://sandradodd.com/spouses</a><br/>

I think though that forcing children to share personal possessions, like<br/>
backpacks is wrong.  I compare it to asking adults to do this.  I have on<br/>
occasion really confused a well-meaning mom forcing her crying child to hand<br/>
over a backpack to be examined by others and to have her personal<br/>
possessions scattered.  The mom is usually pontificating on sharing but<br/>
looks just horrified when I ask if this extends to me rooting around her<br/>
handbag.  However were I to go through her handbag, use her cellphone or try<br/>
on her makeup she would probably not see the &quot;value&quot; of sharing.  If I did<br/>
so without permission, especially.  Children do have personal possessions<br/>
and they get to choose what happens to them.  I have seen moms lend their<br/>
child&#39;s sweater to another without asking, too.  Adults do not respect<br/>
children&#39;s bodies or possessions for the most part.  This often gets<br/>
obfuscated in the great sharing debate.  We certainly expect a generosity<br/>
from children that we aren&#39;t willing to demand from adults:)<br/>
<br/>
There has to be a balance.  My kids have had toys stolen, and broken.  That<br/>
is very hard.  So, if the trike is in the park as a toy for all that is one<br/>
thing to be shared, but if a child brings his/her trike they should decide<br/>
who they will share it with.<br/>
<br/>
Rowan had a tricycle stolen as a two and a half year old.  It was outside a<br/>
park bathroom.  We looked everywhere, and he wondered if the kids who had<br/>
used it earlier took it, thinking it abandoned.<br/>
<br/>
Many of the mothers had been so happy that he &quot;shared&quot;, and wanted the<br/>
secret.  I never gave it much thought that kids don&#39;t have the luxury of<br/>
their own belongings.  Rowan had no problem lending the trike out and many<br/>
kids had used it. For the most part I had modelled sharing inadvertently by<br/>
sharing with him and his dad.  However, I have to confess I don&#39;t give my<br/>
carkeys to strangers;-)<br/>

<br/>
Getting ready to go, looking for shoes and getting arms into coats can be a good time to check in and possibly mention why goodbye is a nice thing to do. Hellos - a reminder just before getting out of the car (or when you hear someone elses car pull up) can help, too. <br/>

<br/>
Keeping toys he doesn&#39;t want to share in the car can work, too. I don&#39;t know the temperature where you live, but something I used to do with Mo was to set up the car as a place where she could go and have a break if she needed to get away from other people for awhile. That made it easier to visit longer - she could go chill out for ten minutes (or whatever) and then be ready to play again. I&#39;d also make sure to offer to play with the other child while she was having her break both as a way to reassure the other child and to &quot;run interferrence&quot; and make sure Mo really did get her little bit of solitude. <br/>

To some extent, that&#39;s going to depend on the *other* people. There are situations where I&#39;ll advise against Mo bringing a portable electronic game in particular because it will bring her *more* attention rather than providing her with a buffer, like to homes where video games are strictly regulated. Now admittedly, we don&#39;t go to homes like that very often, but visiting extended family with younger children, or some of our school-at-home friends are times I&#39;d think twice about something like the gameboy and recommend Mo keep it in some kind of &quot;safe space&quot; - locked in the car or room, out of sight of the other kids. <br/>

<br/>
If you had an iPod the first month they came out (and they&#39;re still not out in India, I discovered recently) and you chose to take it out where other adults were who were very curious about it and hadn&#39;t seen one and wanted to just hold it to see how heavy it was, or maybe turn it to see how the image uprights itself, and you said NO, it&#39;s mine, I don&#39;t have to share it, it probably would have been better for you just not to bring it out to the gathering at all.  If you were being forced by someone else to foray into that social situation, perhaps that other person should have foreseen that if you weren&#39;t able to go out without your iPod, it might be too soon to go out.  Or maybe they could have found some way to encourage you to share it for a while and then put it away. Or to feel better about not taking it at all.<br/>
