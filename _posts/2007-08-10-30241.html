<div id="ygrps-yiv-2004016386">Thank you to everyone who wrote me off list with suggestions on what<br/>
to do about the laptop! To answer a few of the questions - yes it was<br/>
powered up and running when the spill happened (dd was playing a game<br/>
on it). When it first happened the sound distorted sharply then went<br/>
mute, the screen stopped working and went black and it would not turn<br/>
off by pressing the power button. Juice was just running out of it<br/>
from every crack so I was not holding my hopes very high.<br/>
<br/>
I quickly unplugged it, took the battery out and disassembled it as<br/>
much as possible and let it sit in a breezy spot overnight. This<br/>
evening all the parts seemed dry, so I screwed everything together and<br/>
I&#39;m *very* happy to report that it&#39;s working!! It powered up, the OS<br/>
loaded, all our files seem to be intact, etc. So far no glitches or<br/>
lost data that I can see. Some of the keys stuck a bit at first but<br/>
are loosening up now.<br/>
<br/>
We are all relieved and thrilled! We thought for *sure* it was death<br/>
by juice. I &#39;ve been thinking about it and although I don&#39;t believe in<br/>
supernatural events or deities, I somehow feel that if I&#39;d shamed,<br/>
screamed, or spanked dd over this incident - if I&#39;d put that kind of<br/>
negative, violent energy out into the world - that the laptop would<br/>
not be humming along smoothly now. Just a strange sort of hunch, but<br/>
it feels true.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not to mention that your daughter probably already felt really bad <br/>
about it.  My daughter was mucking about in the creek by our house the <br/>
other day and dropped the MP3 player in it.  Not only did she feel bad <br/>
about it possibly not working again, she had to search in the foot deep <br/>
muddy water for it, while wading through it with her shoes, while the <br/>
dog sat anxiously waiting for her on the bank.<br/>
<br/>
It probably would work still, but while I was taking it apart to dry it <br/>
out and get the mud out, I accidentally ripped the power wire that was <br/>
attatched to a flimsy piece of plastic paper stuff.<br/>
<br/>
We both killed it!  Now we can&#39;t listen to cd&#39;s in the car, and she <br/>
can&#39;t take cd&#39;s and headphones with her when we go places.  I guess <br/>
it&#39;s time for an ipod!<br/>
<br/>
We were sad about it for sure!  Some other kids we know would be <br/>
punished for such a thing, but Chamille is way more important than an <br/>
MP3 player!  The MP3 player was free, my dh won it from a business card <br/>
drawing at a local Subway shop.  We&#39;ve had it for over a year, so now <br/>
we&#39;ve opened the door for something better to come our way!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s weird and still totally understandable to be attatched to things <br/>
that we own, especially if we&#39;ve paid a lot of money for something and <br/>
feel we can&#39;t replace it.  <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, I thought I&#39;d lost my pocket knife that I&#39;ve had since I was <br/>
a kid.  I use it all the time, it&#39;s a really good knife and the company <br/>
that made it doesn&#39;t make them decent anymore.  It&#39;s almost a <br/>
collector&#39;s item, but I use it all the time anyway.  I started crying, <br/>
then shook myself out of it and ran to the park before it was too dark <br/>
to see, to look around for it.  I spent a long time looking for it, but <br/>
it wasn&#39;t until I said, &quot;I hope whoever finds it needs it more than I <br/>
do.&quot; that I found it.<br/>
<br/>
I was thrilled that I needed it more than me... I was literally jumping <br/>
up and down for pure joy of finding my pocket knife!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad you still have your laptop!</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, she did. From my original post on AU: My daughter is very, very<br/>
sorry about the situation and she cried, too, which made me even<br/>
sadder. &lt;snip&gt; once I&#39;d collected myself I went and gave her a big hug<br/>
and we talked about it. I&#39;m not angry with her - and I made a point of<br/>
telling her this (and that she means more to me than the laptop of<br/>
course)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I had this experience recently! I was at a women&#39;s retreat and I was<br/>
getting ready for the Friday night activities when I lost one of my<br/>
contacts. I have *really* poor vision without them and I my glasses<br/>
were being repaired at the time, so I didn&#39;t have them. I knew I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be able to see much the rest of the weekend and would<br/>
probably end up with a raging headache from squinting out of one eye.<br/>
Several women jumped in to help me search for it but nothing turned<br/>
up.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d been holding the panic I felt at bay but eventually it seemed<br/>
obvious that we weren&#39;t going to find it and I felt like crying. I was<br/>
thinking about what a crappy time I&#39;d have and how much I had looked<br/>
forward to the event -- pretty much feeling really sorry for myself.<br/>
After a few more minutes I called off the search so my friends could<br/>
go enjoy their evening. I decided to come to terms with the missing<br/>
contact and I found myself thinking of ways that I could still have<br/>
fun and find joy in the weekend despite this obstacle. As soon as I<br/>
accepted the situation I felt a feeling of calmness wash over me and<br/>
then just a moment later my friend called out, &quot;Hey is this it?&quot; and<br/>
sure enough it was, stuck to the side of the tissue boxes as plain as<br/>
day even though we&#39;d all checked it several times.  :)<br/>
