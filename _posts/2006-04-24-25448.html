<div id="ygrps-yiv-297661932">... since I only just started posting on this list.<br/>
<br/>
I am a 43yo mom to 7 kids, ages almost 20 down to 3.<br/>
We took our kids out of school when my oldest was in 2nd grade.   My husband<br/>
had always wanted to homeschool them and he has always been basically an<br/>
unschooler in many ways.  That is, his approach to the kids learning is way<br/>
more unschooly and life-oriented than mine is.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t until I found JOhn Holt&#39;s books and Growing Without Schooling<br/>
newsletters in the library that I could see how it might work.  I loved his<br/>
writings, but couldn&#39;t seem to bring myself to desert the &quot;schooly&quot; things<br/>
altogether for several years.   We would go back and forth.... less<br/>
structure or more, depending on circumstances.  I&#39;m not sure exactly why<br/>
this has been such a difficult process for me.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m making a serious try at it, now.... last year was spent deschooling<br/>
(myself, mostly) and this year I&#39;m trying to replace it a bit with &quot;real&quot;<br/>
things.   It doesn&#39;t come that easily.   It helps that our parenting<br/>
approach was always sort of reciprocal and &quot;attached&quot;.    I can see that <br/>
responsiveness works with parenting, but somehow it&#39;s more difficult to <br/>
extend that to academics.<br/>
<br/>
 I hated school all through and didn&#39;t feel I learned anything, so why did I <br/>
think it would work for my kids?  Maybe I thought it would be different if <br/>
it wasn&#39;t a building.   I am not sure.<br/>
