<div id="ygrps-yiv-1784729246">Zak wants me to leave him alone in the house while I go to the library and<br/>
he&#39;s 7 (8 in August).  I&#39;m like you Heidi C in order for Zak and Max to be<br/>
in the back garden I have to have the padlock on the back gate and the side<br/>
gate and I still look out every few minutes.  I&#39;m absolutely convinced that<br/>
if I don&#39;t someone will steal them. This unfortunately is something that was<br/>
instilled in me as a child because my parents knew of a threat of my<br/>
abduction (long story) and had to have the police watch me for about 2<br/>
weeks.  Even though I don&#39;t specifically remember this time in my life (I<br/>
was 9, I&#39;m told), I&#39;ve heard about it so much from my mother and grandmother<br/>
that it instilled fear in me that, that would happen to my kids.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I am at the point that if I have a client and am working in my office (all<br/>
my work is done on the phone) then Zak can stay home and play while Steve<br/>
and Max go out.  So far that has worked.  In AZ the legal age is 12 and yes<br/>
because of nosy neighbors I don&#39;t want to give them anything to call CPS<br/>
about.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I&#39;ve left my 6 1/2 yr old alone, with my two youngest so I could walk my&gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt;5 yr old to preschool across the street.  Tops, I&#39;ve been gone about 15&gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt;minutes.  But it really goes against all my instincts because I&#39;m a &gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt;dreadful worrier and she&#39;s not really good with the phone yet in case of&gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt;an emergency.   I&#39;m just starting to let the two older ones play alone &gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt;in the backyard, and even with that, I have to check on them every &gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt;couple of minutes just to make sure some &quot;bad&quot; man hasn&#39;t run off with&gt;&lt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt;them.  See, plain old paranoid, that&#39;s me.  How old is Brianna?  How&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt;does she really feel about being alone?  HeidiC.&gt;<br/>
