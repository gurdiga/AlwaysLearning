&lt;&lt; The poster has unsubscribed, unfortunately. But, as most of us know, once<br/>
ideas have entered our brains, even if we try to reject them, sometimes they<br/>
work themselves out into something positive after a time.<br/>

<br/>
I lost count of the number of people who have said either in real life, in <br/>
the SCA, or about unschooling, that they used to think I was full of shit, <br/>
but they thought about it for a while (or something profound happened to <br/>
them, or they heard it from somewhere else and it made sense, and they <br/>
realized I&#39;d said it years before and-why-did-they wait), and now they don&#39;t <br/>
think I&#39;m full of shit.<br/>
<br/>
Some people will go to their graves thinking I&#39;m full of shit.<br/>
<br/>
And that gives me a kinda warm, earthy, pungent...      eeeyew!! WAIT!!!!<br/>

Nope, nope, nope!!  I took a BATH today!  I&#39;m all happy and clean.  AND <br/>
Holly&#39;s washing the bedding.  Tomorrow my friend Annealiz is going to wash my <br/>
hair.  <br/>

jejunum and ileum) are about 20 feet long and the large intestine (colon) <br/>
is 5 feet long.  So, technically, you&#39;ve got about 25 feet of contributing <br/>
evidence there....  Albeit if it were full, you&#39;d definitely notice and <br/>
probably do something about it...  I mean, Ouch!  Frankly, you don&#39;t seem <br/>
the constipated sort.<br/>

Why, yes, I am a riot at cocktail parties.  Why do you ask?<br/>
