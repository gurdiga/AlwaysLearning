I have heard that Tony Robinson (who played Baldrick on Black Adder) is  <br/>
hugely popular in England for doing TV series on history and archeology, and  this <br/>
is related to some of that.  It&#39;s a quiz to tell you what horrible  medieval <br/>
job you are best suited for.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Wow.  <br/>
 <br/>
The scary part isn&#39;t medieval at all.  It&#39;s that in England there is a  <br/>
reality program called &quot;How Clean is Your House&quot; where people (it seems implied)  <br/>
come and visit and inspect and put the thing on TV.  YIKES!<br/>

  is so bad. I watched it once while visiting a friends house over here.  I only watched it because it is the type of friend who keeps the television on when you are there.  I was so shocked.  The women&#39;s house was disgusting not just messy but truly dirty and she seemed to be so pleased to be on television showing the world how bad it all was.  I know there are days when the washing up does not get done and the house is a mess here but those are the days that this house is only open to really true friends who know that human beings are more important to us than the state of the house.  However the one thing that got to me was the mouldy food in the fridge and the piles of dirty washing all over the place.  Maybe I am a closet clean and tidy person ----No NOT ME----<br/>

 </span></blockquote>FYI - I&#39;m pretty sure I saw an ad that they are going to start <br/>
running that show here in the US as well, perhaps on HGTV or another <br/>
of those &quot;fix-it&quot; channels... Doubt if I ever have time to watch it<br/>
(because if I get a spare minute from playing with my kid or working <br/>
on my home business then it will go towards chatting on the puter or <br/>
cleaning my own house or sleeping or someing, but you never know...) <br/>
But I know they have some real crazy shows here on US TV as well... <br/>
So honestly I could imagine, they people do get a clean house out of <br/>
it -- don&#39;t they?? Although if they were coming to my house I would <br/>
lock them out, although that show that gives away the free kitchen <br/>
makeover - I would welcome them. Speaking of those &quot;real life&quot; tv <br/>
shows has anyone ever seen the one about the nanny that comes in and <br/>
tells the parents what they&#39;re doing wrong? I watched it for 20 <br/>
minutes once and had to turn it because my blood was boiling that I <br/>
was so mad! I hope life learning / unschooling gets so popular they <br/>
eventually get whole TV networks of their own to air some decent <br/>
shows.... I know I&#39;m a dreamer... Barbara aka Moza</div>

I saw part of one, and the nanny was telling the dad he needed NOT to  spank, <br/>
not to hit, or she was outa there.   She got them to deal with  the kids in <br/>
way better ways than hitting.  So maybe it doesn&#39;t suck  uniformly. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My kids and I love these shows (Nanny 911 and Supernanny). Most of the time,<br/>
the nanny works with the parents to listen to their kids, and help the<br/>
parents see what THEY are doing to make things crazy in the house (ignoring<br/>
the children, yelling at them, spanking them, ridiculing them). Aside from<br/>
their propensity for saying that kids have to sleep in their own beds, we&#39;ve<br/>
found the nannies to be supportive of the children, and supportive of better<br/>
parenting. We&#39;ve had GREAT conversations based on those shows.<br/>

That&#39;s how I feel about those shows too.  They usually leave the families<br/>
better off than when they arrived.  Some of those families are in total<br/>
chaos.  But the big deal they make over sleeping in their own beds does make<br/>
me a little nuts.<br/>

Yes this is &quot;Time Team&quot; that plays on History International (part of the<br/>
Discovery stable of cable channels) but not as that title, so sometimes it<br/>
is hard to find. I have seen it under the banner of &quot;History Traveler&quot; I<br/>
*think*. (It&#39;s been a while.)<br/>

<br/>
I love this show. It&#39;s like a game show for Archeologists, with a time<br/>
limit. What I love about it most I think is how delightedly excited they all<br/>
get when they realize that their theory is WRONG and they have to revise and<br/>
rethink. They employ a mixture of high tech searching methods and ancient<br/>
artisan techniques for reproductions.<br/>
