Well, dang.  I better renew my subscription.  I let it go because I was<br/>
confident I could read Sandra&#39;s articles on her website.  Now there&#39;s you<br/>
and Ren, bunch of show off writer types making me resubscribe...<br/>

Well, if THAT&#39;S all it takes, Helen can just flat-out hire me to *imply* that <br/>
I&#39;m writing for her----maybe her subcription count will go up just with the <br/>
*possibility*! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
~Kelly, happy she can do whatever she can for HEM<br/>

How about working on the shipping rates to Canada?  Last time I checked they were almost as much as the subscription itself! &lt;grin&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, and single copies aren&#39;t available on newstands. I can afford one at a <br/>
time but not a subscription. So I read it 2 months late (if I get to it <br/>
first, otherwise even later) at the library.<br/>

Are they shipping from Alaska or where?  Maybe recommend that they find a <br/>
border printer/shipper.  When an American publication is only charging a little <br/>
more for Canadian it&#39;s probably because they have a deal with shippers who are <br/>
near the Canadian border and instead of shipping individual issues, they send <br/>
the magazines by the pallet-ful by truck to a Canadian post office.<br/>

<br/>
In fact, I just plugged Tonasket into yahoo maps.  They are very close to the border.  Maybe they print the magazine somewhere else, though.  The website says subscriptions to Canada are $16.  That must mean add $16?<br/>

individual copies. I can usually afford one copy, but it&#39;s harder to come <br/>
up with enough for a subscription, even though it saves money. I wrote <br/>
asking where I could buy single copies, and Helen or somebody wrote back <br/>
and said it&#39;s too much hassle to send them over the boarder and deal with <br/>
exchange rates and such. I thought it was a little strange because we can <br/>
get just about any magazine published in the States at the bigger <br/>
newsstands and bookstores here.<br/>

Canada. That&#39;s $48 U.S. Add $20-$25 to that for the currency difference, <br/>
and you&#39;ll see why I have trouble scraping together subscription money.<br/>

Oh duh.  Never mind me.  Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
But you guys have Life Learning which is wonderful, and HEM online has some <br/>
article, and I think all of mine are online now.  Maybe all but a couple I&#39;ll <br/>
find someday when I&#39;m looking for something else.    And I have one of Mary&#39;s <br/>
online, HEM has one of Ren&#39;s and...<br/>
<br/>
Well...<br/>
<br/>
You have this list!  (Trying to make up for bad info... &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
