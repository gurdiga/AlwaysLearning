<div id="ygrps-yiv-1039555826"><html><head></head><div>Bedtime help needed please. Have lost it this evening. Usually bedtimes here are fab lately but tonight I&#39;m suddenly feeling resentful. Most of the children still want/need quite a lot of input when they go to bed. The later they are ready to retire, the harder that is for us to do. Spending 90 minutes with them helping them quieten down and settle starting at 7.30pm is one thing. Starting at 9, 10pm is quite another. Dh and I are getting exhausted. I know it&#39;s early days for us this time around, but after a good couple of weeks being genuinely joyful about these chilled bedtimes, I&#39;ve just been yelling about it this evening. (Haven&#39;t yelled for weeks now - since we started unschooling) why now? Pmt? Just overtiredness? Any ideas of where to go next?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><div style="font-size:75%;color:#575757;">Sent from Samsung Mobile</div></div></html></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-961359926"><html><div style="color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"><div>Some nights you&#39;re going to be tired before your kids are. You&#39;ll be grumpy and unsympathetic. That&#39;s normal. And having had a taste of how that can go wrong, now you have a chance to make some more thoughtful plans for the future so that Next time you&#39;re tired or hormonal or otherwise grumpy and out of sorts you&#39;re less likely to resort to yelling. What might have helped? Could you have put in a movie and said: I&#39;m wiped out? If the kids are tending to go to bed later, can you do some things earlier in the evening so that by the time you&#39;re getting tired you don&#39;t have to think too much?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:16.363636016845703px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">It helps me, whenever possible, to step back and see how a lot
 of parenting issues are really logistical puzzles - with the catch being that some of the resources you&#39;re trying to manage are Your Own internal resources. One of the things I learned as an unschooling parent was to pay attention to my own resources and really notice when I was &quot;off&quot; so that I could remind myself to slow down and lower my expectations for myself. Sometimes that meant making sure to eat a little more often, or look for chances to sit down and rest more, or Engineer chances to sit down and rest more, or to flat out tell my partner and kids: I&#39;m whooped - somebody give me a hand, please? And having seen me &quot;whooped&quot; and not ask for help, my partner and kids have a vested interest in helping me out. In that sense, have a night where you come unglued and yell a little isn&#39;t a disaster -it&#39;s a chance for everyone to learn a little and a point of reference for next time.&nbsp;</div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1457281687"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Dh and I are getting exhausted.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>After the age of 7 or so, Ethan started staying awake later and later in the evenings.  Doug and I were very resistant to this change in the beginning, because it meant that we didn&#39;t have time to just relax together for the last remaining hour or two of the day.  Doug and I have always been night owls ourselves, rarely going to bed before midnight.  It was not really a surprise that Ethan wanted to stay up too.  He&#39;s always wanted to be a part of most things we do.<br/>
<br/>
Doug and I began to shift our thinking from only having our time together in the evenings, to being open to opportunities to have time together in the mornings, or in the middle of the night, or when Ethan was watching a movie or playing with a friend.  I made a point to touch Doug more - rub his back, hold his hand, smile, tell him I love him.  Every little opportunity to connect meant we were waiting less for that one specially designated time.  <br/>
<br/>
Nowadays Ethan (11 years) stays up at least as late as we do.  We have a loose routine.  Whoever wants to, showers.  We all put on pjs.  Doug usually makes himself and me a sleepy tea.  Ethan often has oatmeal.  He used to have peas and carrots - his request.  Lately he&#39;s been asking for miso soup.  He says he rests easier with a full tummy.  I usually read aloud for a bit in bed in our softly lit room.  Then we chat for a short while, brush teeth and Ethan heads over to his room.  Doug and I then usually go to sleep.  <br/>
<br/>
Often, in his room, Ethan will read to himself.  He loves comics and facts books.  Sometimes he will finish up a game or YouTube video, but not one that gets him too excited because it&#39;s too noisy for Doug and I.  Not very often any more, but still occasionally, Ethan will ask me to come and sleep with him.  I do, until he falls asleep.  Then I head back to my own bed.  Sometimes I stay the whole night, especially if he isn&#39;t feeling well.  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what works for us today.  At some point in the not-too-distant future this will shift again, I&#39;m sure.  Find what works for you all.  Change little things -not everything all at once.  See how people respond.  Little by little, move toward a easier conclusion to the day.  <br/>
<br/>
What has exhausted me (and Doug) most in the past (and sometimes still) is having rigid expectations for how events of the day or evening *should* progress.  When I can let things happen more naturally (taking into consideration real limits), I find, even when tired, I&#39;m softer.  Doug is too.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2056302517">Both kids and adults can be overtired, but I think it tends to look pretty different, which is maybe why adults aren&#39;t accused of being overtired as often.  In our house at least, when the kids are overtired they start to have a lot of trouble controlling their emotions.  They might have an enormous fit because they can&#39;t find their favorite pj&#39;s, or start crying hysterically because her sister smirked at her, both things that they would have been able to handle in less emotional ways at other times of the day.  Or they may start taunting each other, at first verbally, but it almost always turns violent when they are overtired.  But mostly, overtired in our house looks like kids running wildly through the house, laughing hysterically while they are knocking things off of tables and counters and destroying other people&#39;s projects, as well as bumping into and pushing over their sisters.  Some of the damage is accidental and some is done intentionally,<br/>
 although I don&#39;t think in the moment they really meant to hurt each other or us.  Overtired conflicts pretty much always end in tears, usually from emotional causes but sometimes also physical causes.<br/>
<br/>
When my husband or I am feeling overtired we may get grumpy and a whole lot less patient.  We are more likely to snap at someone, inflicting emotional pain, but we never have big temper tantrums or cry unexpectedly over tiny slights.  We never run through the house looking like we are out of control of our physical bodies, and we never hit anyone, but we are just as overtired.  I suppose it&#39;s a difference in scale.  If I were to act like my children do when they are overtired when I am feeling overtired, I wouldn&#39;t be accused of being overtired but of acting immaturely (and I&#39;d probably be guilty of some child abuse).  I suppose that is a double standard.  Overtired adults tend to be called grumpy or maybe the opposite being slap-happy (where you find everything very funny, but that typically only happens when I&#39;m up with my husband or good friends really late at night).  But overtired adults don&#39;t act like overtired children, so maybe there is a good<br/>
 reason to have a special word to describe what&#39;s happening with children.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids are acting in ways that I would describe as overtired, my husband and I do what we can to help them calm back down.  This is generally something that they are unable to do at that moment for themselves, but that they desperately need from us.  I think the whole experience is probably a bit frightening for them, so they usually need/want lots more snuggling and comfort from us when they are overtired and have lost control of themselves.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-700951408">&quot;Also, one thing I really struggle with is being present with one child while another wants you and is waiting for their &#39;turn&#39; with you&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes this is a big challenge for us too.  I typically go to each child who has to wait and make a plan about what they might do- play games or watch video on iPod are the most popular things right now for us.  I tell them if they get to the point they can&#39;t wait anymore to quietly snuggle up to my other side so the one who is almost asleep isn&#39;t bothered.  The planning ahead usually helps.  I also try to separate the waiting kids so they don&#39;t get into arguments while I&#39;m occupied.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-283526196">I went to google.co.uk to see if &quot;overtired&quot; is used of adults as well as children in the UK.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe a bit more, but it&#39;s still not a super-common term.  Here were the related searches:<br/>
<br/>
overtired symptoms<br/>
overtired baby<br/>
too much sleep<br/>
fatigue<br/>
inertia<br/>
overtired newborn<br/>
overtired baby symptoms<br/>
overtired baby keeps waking up<br/>
<br/>
Still seems to be focusing on negativity.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s not something you would say to a visiting friend (&quot;Oh, you&#39;re just overtired&quot;) then it&#39;s probably not a good thing to say to a child.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I&#39;m struggling to work out why there&#39;s such an issue with the semantics-=-<br/>
<br/>
Because people are defending it. :-)<br/>
<br/>
-=- Could you maybe just re-read my messages and assume I&#39;m using a term you would deem appropriate for adults and children alike? -=-<br/>
<br/>
I could, but that wouldn&#39;t be a good use of my volunteer time and energy.<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be more helpful to you and to however many hundred people might read this topic, if you could re-read my messages and assume that I had a reason for spending that time trying to point out why that term, and the thinking behind it, could be a problem for someone wanting to understand unschooling better.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I really want to figure this problem out. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t see it  as a problem.  <br/>
<br/>
Read a little (here, at the links maybe), try a little (try different things you&#39;ve read), wait a while (writing over and over isn&#39;t giving yourself time to let ideas enter) and watch (does changing something within yourself make a difference in the situation?)<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/semantics">http://sandradodd.com/semantics</a><br/>
<br/>
-=-Could you maybe just re-read-=-<br/>
<br/>
I left the &quot;just&quot; out when I quoted back above, because &quot;just&quot; is dismissive.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-How amazing there was another unschooler around the corner I didn&#39;t know about-=-<br/>
<br/>
Her child isn&#39;t yet three, so that&#39;s probably why. :-)  She&#39;s a proto-unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Natarsha has also offered to have you for a night so I guess it&#39;s up to you if you want to move around. -=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s probably better not to try to stay three places in four nights.   Could we maybe plan to have a meal at her house or something like that, so there&#39;s time to sit and be casual and I can see her place?   I have no idea of the size, distance and logistics, so if that&#39;s not practical, that&#39;s okay. <br/>
<br/>
As she has offered, maybe doing something toward her house, in her house, would be cool, if I&#39;m staying at yours.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2102564861"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Maybe no one wants to admit they can&#39;t help on this one and I&#39;ll just have to figure it out myself.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think there are two things are happening here.  One is that you are not seeing that people are very sincerely, and very generously trying to help you shift your thinking so that you will be able to more clearly and peacefully address any difficulties that might come up today and in the future.  <br/>
<br/>
And, two, that no matter what is said here, you will always need to figure out what works best for your family yourself.  People here cannot tell you what to do to make things easier.  They can only share insight on what will help anyone navigate a successful unschooling life.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;focusing on one word that took up less space than &#39;so tired she us crying a lot more than usual and is more short tempered&#39;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The words we choose matter.  You chose over-tired.  Let&#39;s talk about bananas.<br/>
<br/>
I have some bananas hanging in a basket that we have neglected to eat.  They are beyond spotty.  They are turning black.  If I call them over-ripe, I am, in essence, saying that they are potentially ruined.  There is little to nothing I can do with them.  If I call them really, really ripe, I can think about all of the things I can make with really ripe bananas.  <br/>
<br/>
The bananas themselves are not any different in either description I could choose to use.  But the way *I* address the issue of the state of the bananas will be very different.  In one instance I will likely toss the bananas out.  In the other, I might make some delicious tasting banana bread or a wonderfully rich and delicious smoothy.  <br/>
<br/>
You might initially think this is a very silly comparison, but stop for a day or two and think about it.  Please, do.  The more I have learned to generously look at and describe in words any situation involving my son, the more possibilities have been opened to me for solving his, or my, or our challenges.  Don&#39;t use words that lead to dead ends.  Practice finding ones that open up many possibilities.  It really helps.</div>
