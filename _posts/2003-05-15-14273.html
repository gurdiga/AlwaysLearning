<h4>coyote&#39;s corner</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-190655820">Thank you so much for asking. I really appreciate that.<br/>
I&#39;m fine.<br/>
It was almost thirteen years ago. <br/>
My ex MIL is gone. Oddly, she was waked  on what would have been my 32nd wedding anniversary.<br/>
<br/>
She was so horrible.<br/>
She paid.<br/>
So did her children.<br/>
Her oldest son - my ex - died at 38 (drugs)<br/>
Her oldest daughter is unhealthily obese & has raised very demanding bullies (Her son reminds me of Harry Potters&#39; cousin!)<br/>
Her youngest son is a serial sperm donor - 5 & counting w/ no responsibility (my ex MIL knew that these girls were lying - DNA wasn&#39;t as good as her Jimmy telling her the truth)<br/>
Her youngest daughter is in assisted living - suicidal, severe depression - she&#39;s the sanest one left.<br/>
<br/>
I out lived Aggie<br/>
My kids are healthy.<br/>
I&#39;m not doing too bad.<br/>
Brianna just came in said &quot;I love you&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As our friend says &quot;Life is Good&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Janis<br/>
