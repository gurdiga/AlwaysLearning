Congratulations!  Sounds like you have done everything needed for <br/>
your court presentation.  You might want to also collect information <br/>
on the long-term potentially harmful effects of all those drugs your <br/>
son was on.  Especially since no one has adequately tested the <br/>
synergistic effects of so many meds on children&#39;s delicate brains and <br/>
other vital systems (kidneys, liver, pancreas, etc.).  If his dad <br/>
can&#39;t present proof that these are totally safe, then you can sue him <br/>
for the potential lifetime effects of forcing your son to be on all <br/>
those meds.  Best of luck and keep us posted.  <br/>

<br/>
Yes, you sound well prepared.<br/>
<br/>
Some judges can be pig-headed and you aren&#39;t guaranteed a good outcome <br/>
even if you are in the right.<br/>
<br/>
Is there any way to have a non-confrontational discussion with your ex? <br/>
  (Feel free to laugh at my blissful ignorance of his personality.) <br/>
Would he listen to you or your son if approached calmly with concern for <br/>
his beliefs?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s worthwhile to use whatever logic, wiles or leverage that you have <br/>
in this situation.  (Maybe a mutual relative as a go-between?)<br/>

Good luck!<br/>

Congratulations on homeschooling your child, and getting him off all <br/>
those meds. I could not imagine putting my daughters on Ritilan. My <br/>
nephew and a couple of my cousins had been on it, and they were even <br/>
more violent while taking it. I do not believe in using meds for <br/>
AD/HD/ODD with young children. And, I&#39;m not sure on this, but I don&#39;t <br/>
think that it is a good idea to have such a small child on all of <br/>
those meds all at once. I would think that the long term side affects <br/>
would be horrible.  I believe that doctors are way too quick to <br/>
diagnose AD/HD/ODD. <br/>
<br/>
As far as depression goes, I have another nephew with it, and he does <br/>
just fine with no meds. His parents are lucky that his school works <br/>
with them, and they are always there for him.<br/>
<br/>
I think you have a good handle on things to bring with you concerning <br/>
homeschooling, but I&#39;m not sure if I would do anything spiteful <br/>
against the father for disagreeing. Homeschooling is legal in all 50 <br/>
states, so I think that he would have to show proof that you are NOT <br/>
educating your son. It sounds to me like he doesn&#39;t have a chance. <br/>
Maybe if you offered him some, but not complete, say in what your son <br/>
learns. And let the judge know that you would like to have the <br/>
fathers input.<br/>
<br/>
You could even call the father some time and say something <br/>
like, &quot;Hey, I just wanted to get your input on (Son&#39;s name) school <br/>
subjects. He is doing very well and is getting good grades, and I was <br/>
wondering how you felt about...&quot;  Maybe he would like to feel more <br/>
involved. Make sure he knows about any programs that are available in <br/>
your area. Some examples are: Book clubs at the library, day sports <br/>
camps in the summer, church and Sunday school, craft classes, boy <br/>
scouts, YM/WCA programs, homeschooling 4-H programs, play groups. <br/>
That way he will know that you want your child to have some <br/>
experiences outside of the home. It might not be a bad idea to <br/>
mention these things to the judge, as well. If he is already <br/>
attending any of these, get letters from these sources as well. If <br/>
you go to church, a letter from the reverend/father, etc. would also <br/>
count.<br/>
<br/>
As long as you are doing what you truly believe is the best thing for <br/>
your son, you should be okay.  Who knows, if your husband is totally <br/>
against homeschooling and slips and says the wrong thing, you may <br/>
find that the judge will find it offensive because his daughter <br/>
homeschool her children. ;)<br/>
<br/>
Hope i didn&#39;t offend anyone. JMHO<br/>

Love, hope, and happiness to all.</div>
