unschool curriculum and not extend it farther into other areas of <br/>

some mean when they say they unschool but not radically).  My own <br/>
experience says that it can&#39;t be done without seriously damaging the <br/>

unschooling work as awesomely as it does.<br/>

<br/>
I agree it&#39;s a problem.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I very much lead my kids. As my older daughter has gotten older,<br/>
<br/>

compulsion, but more like a guidance counselor would do it, listen<br/>
and watch and observe and offer direction and help as needed.-=-<br/>
<br/>
At our house we all have tons of influence over the other people in  <br/>
lots of ways--food, music, movies, clothes, projects, getting along  <br/>
with others...<br/>
<br/>
-=-I also have issues with &quot;radical&quot; unschooling too. We either  <br/>
unschool or we don&#39;t. Unschooling is extremely radical for most  <br/>
people already. I also don&#39;t buy into the idea that any parent can  <br/>
unschool curriculum and not extend it farther into other areas of  <br/>
life and have unschooling work effectively (and I think this is what  <br/>
some mean when they say they unschool but not radically). -=-<br/>
<br/>
I agree, but many people do it until it doesn&#39;t work anymore, and  <br/>
then say  unschooling doesn&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My own experience says that it can&#39;t be done without seriously  <br/>
damaging the parent/child relationship and trust issues that really  <br/>
make unschooling work as awesomely as it does.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure about this, but I think I&#39;m starting to see evidence  <br/>
(some of things that have already happened in some places) of  <br/>
families in which the mom isn&#39;t wholly honest with the dad.  There&#39;s  <br/>
some family damage, even if the mom/child relationship is okay, and  <br/>
the dad/child relationship is okay, but it&#39;s because the mom is being  <br/>
devious to some degree.  I might not be seeing clearly.  It&#39;s like  <br/>
shapes in the fog (socially speaking), because I hear indicators and  <br/>
talk among kids, but no mom-accounts (yet).<br/>
<br/>
-=-I don&#39;t know if John Holt ever intended unschooling to be what  <br/>
I&#39;ve come to know it as, but he certainly planted the seeds of change  <br/>
in the way we can raise our kids without forcible teaching.-=-<br/>
<br/>
He didn&#39;t make up homeschooling or alternative education, but he was  <br/>
observing and writing about them as they were happening.  When he was  <br/>
in Colorado and northern New Mexico (not living in Santa Fe, I think,  <br/>
but visiting the alternative school and some of the people there, and  <br/>
I know one person about five years older than I am who went to the  <br/>
Rocky Mountain School the first two years of it or so, maybe not when  <br/>
John Holt was there),  he saw alternative education working, and  <br/>
people just not sending their kids to school (or not to &quot;real schools&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
The first writing I saw of his was the combination of those two  <br/>
things--saying &quot;here&#39;s how kids learn, and school&#39;s methods aren&#39;t  <br/>
working; it&#39;s possible to keep your kids home.  Those who use John  <br/>
Holt loosely like to say ANY homeschooling (curriculum or not) was  <br/>
&quot;unschooling,&quot; but except for Calvert, I don&#39;t think there were any  <br/>
in the 70&#39;s.  By the 80&#39;s when the fundamentalist Christians thought  <br/>
they had invented homeschooling and started creating Christian school- <br/>
in-a-box, some of them got ideas and support from Growing Without  <br/>
Schooling, but it doesn&#39;t seem any credit was passed on.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway...<br/>
<br/>
I agree with you but I don&#39;t know what to do but to keep talking  <br/>
about it, and keep doing what we do cheerfully, and sharing experiences!<br/>

annoying as that may be &lt;G&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
One problem is that people think, &quot;Oh, child led. I&#39;ll just sit here  <br/>
and wait for my child to lead.&quot; Then, the child isn&#39;t introduced to  <br/>
anything interesting, gets bored, doesn&#39;t do much of anything, the  <br/>
parent says, &quot;Unschooling doesn&#39;t work, MY child needs structure.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Another problem is that people outside the unschooling world think it  <br/>
means that we&#39;re all waiting for our kids to pull their algebra book  <br/>
off the shelf and say, &quot;Mom, teach me algebra.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-45827481">thank you Jenny for bringing this up:<br/>
I am trying to define unschooling in italian and this discription is<br/>
one I am trying to avoid.  <br/>
<br/>
I also see unschooling as instrinsically interrelated with those<br/>
around us...and as my child learns im learning too.<br/>
<br/>
Nor can I envision unschooling without the &quot;radical&quot; part, having come<br/>
to unschooling from the conscious, respectful, partnership parenting<br/>
route: I lead, but I dont trample on others wills (or at least my path<br/>
has been learning Not to)..<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling (when I found out we could homeschool here) is the only<br/>
sort of homeschooling I would find compatable with our parenting<br/>
approach. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe because of our approach, our schooled kids never lost their<br/>
thirst for learning *outside* of school...but this may have to do with<br/>
the 4/5 hour school days as well (well no, we never push homework down<br/>
their throats either, so they usually put their priorities on *their*<br/>
interests.)<br/>
<br/>
I am trying to incorporate the definition of unschooling with the<br/>
parenting aspect already there...or am I totally off to do so?   As it<br/>
is, the people I am talking to are already AP oriented, so it does<br/>
make sense...<br/>
<br/>
what do you all think? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-454228334">I don&#39;t think I lead my children.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes they lead me.  Sometimes I may lead, or at least suggest.  Mostly I model, but for the most part, that&#39;s just part of it... For instance, I go to a museum because I want to go, I model to them, and have since they were young, how I behave in a museum, and we end up enjoying it together... <br/>
<br/>
I share my enthusiasm for things--such as reading, learning, watching star trek... and I share their enthusiasm for things.  For instance, Janene and I share Star Trek... she and I watch it together, we are currently trying to watch ALL the movies, in order.  We watched Voyager, all seasons, 3x through, now we are on the other series... Alexx is into laughing at us watching Star Trek.  Janene and I went to the Star Trek Experience they had in Long Beach, CA recently... Alexx had no desire to go.   Alexx and I share Buffy.  Janene, she&#39;s not into that at all.  <br/>
<br/>
The missions started out being Alexx&#39;s idea, and we kinda just went along... hard for a 6 year old to go to missions alone.  Now, it&#39;s a family thing.  we all go, and we only have 6 more until we&#39;ve seen them all--in California.  There are some on Baja California--maybe we&#39;ll go there next.  <br/>
<br/>
And I wouldn&#39;t even say that we have a child-centered household.  we sometimes do things only because I want to do them--the exhibit on Pompeii is an example of this.  I wanted to do that, the kids just came along.  But they do so with enthusiasm, or at least with a positive attitude.  It&#39;s not like I&#39;m making them, nor is it like they are making me do things they want to do.  We just go into it together.... <br/>
<br/>
I respect what they want to do and go into it with a positive mindset--and often find that I enjoy it a great deal.  They do the same.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I don&#39;t feel as thought I lead, as the adult, nor do I feel that they lead--as in child led learning.  I kinda feel like we are all just going through this together.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind Radical Unschooling as a way to describe what we do.  I like the word &quot;radical.&quot;  Liked it in high school when we&#39;d say &quot;wow, man, that&#39;s radical&quot; and I like it now to describe how we live.  It&#39;s as good of term as any.  We don&#39;t do very many things in the way most of society does them.  We are different--we are radical.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-773734768">Hi joylyn, I really like how you described this<br/>
<br/>
I wrote that I lead, but then I left out the part I meant to write:<br/>
that my children lead too.<br/>
<br/>
maybe the word &#92;lead&#92; is misleading (lol)...it is more like a<br/>
partnership, but not even that either?  <br/>
sometimes a child will take initiative towards an interest: raff my<br/>
fourth (10yo) is totally into UFOs and ancient ruins (aztec mayan<br/>
egyptian) and this has been going on for a few years now, but recently<br/>
it has sort of infected everybody, and we all go of on explorations<br/>
alone to share later or all together (like on the computer, or library)<br/>
<br/>
so it is infectuous initiatives?  I dont know how to express the<br/>
dynamic for someone mainstream I mean.  But yes, I support my<br/>
children, I support my husbands interests, they support mine, and we<br/>
sometimes start getting interested in the various activities as a whole...<br/>
<br/>
Im thinking now my passion for sewing weaving and things threads and<br/>
colours...Ive always messed about with this stuff: dh will always pick<br/>
up beautiful cloths, yarns, threads, bricabrac as well as tools when<br/>
ever he happens apn them in thrift stores etc...<br/>
<br/>
all of my children at some point or other start to join in, and for<br/>
some (like my first daughter Lucia who will be 21 in July) weaving<br/>
sewing and handywork has become her trade ... I work with her, but the<br/>
business for now is in her hands.  And when we both wanted to learn to<br/>
spin this past winter, Matteo ds3 14yo saw us watching some videos on<br/>
youtube of drop spindle spinning, and he disappeared and came back<br/>
with a functional one of a kind drop spindle, which Lucia promptly<br/>
learned to spin on and started selling and weaving with.<br/>
And now dh lorenzo is always looking for spinning wheels (he&#39;s brought<br/>
home two so far since january) and matteo fixes them  up so they run<br/>
smoothly...and now everyone else in the house is learning to spin too.<br/>
<br/>
like wise for music: we are musicians and music just come in and out<br/>
of the home...this will get to long to describe but the exchange and<br/>
support is so life enriching, I cannot imagine living in any other way.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
about the radical part: in italy there are *many* (and when I say<br/>
that, I mean MANY) different political parties...one is &quot;radical&quot; and<br/>
of course it is far far left.  <br/>
<br/>
Part of me would like to avoid hooking up a learning experience with<br/>
radical political nuances: it may scare people away?<br/>
<br/>
what do you think?<br/>
could that be a problem? <br/>

<br/>
Thanks for sharing the dictionary definitions.  I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve ever<br/>
looked that up!  <br/>
<br/>
I agree.  I also like the term radical.  In my local group of<br/>
homeschoolers, I would say that I am the only &quot;radical unschooler&quot;. <br/>
One is on her way.  And the rest just sort of say they are<br/>
unschooling, yet spend their days worrying about structure and<br/>
curriculum and being behind in learning.  They unschool academically<br/>
(I&#39;m aware that doesn&#39;t right :-), but seem to miss out on the<br/>
parenting aspect of it.  <br/>
<br/>
The term Radical Unschooling sort of separates us.  Which could be bad<br/>
or good depending how you look at it.  But sometimes, their version of<br/>
unschooling, is not what I would like to portray.  <br/>

same.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I was merrily in the midst of several online projects,  <br/>
thinking how comfortable the house felt, and how quiet, and Holly  <br/>
came and asked me if I wanted to go to the mall and a movie.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t.  I said not really.  Then I realized what a good  <br/>
opportunity I might miss, and that the internet will be here later,  <br/>
but the chance to go places with Holly won&#39;t always be here.  So I  <br/>
said no, I did want to go.<br/>
<br/>
Her computer is down and I hadn&#39;t thought of that, so she used mine  <br/>
to look of a movie.  We went to see Forgetting Sarah Marshall at the  <br/>
dollar theater ($2 each, on weekends; sometimes $1 or 50 cents), and  <br/>
then went to Claires in the mall and got a three-for-the-price-of-two  <br/>
deal on earrings.  Both of us offered to do more for the other&#39;s  <br/>
sake, both of us asked &quot;do you want to get food?&quot; and both of us were  <br/>
preferring to eat at home.  When we were leaving, Holly said &quot;Do you  <br/>
at least want to get a drink?&quot; but it wasn&#39;t a hopeful question.  She  <br/>
didn&#39;t want one.  She was just considerately trying to make sure I  <br/>
had a good time at the mall and that I was comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really glad we went.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s doing things together that makes unschooling work so well, and  <br/>
so &quot;child led&quot; puts and ugly light on it.  And because in so many  <br/>
homeschooling-in-general families children are considered (poor  <br/>
things) sinful creatures who need to be molded and saved, for us as  <br/>
rational adults to leave the suggestion that we let sinful impetuous  <br/>
wild little creatures lead us around (because we can&#39;t help how they  <br/>
see &quot;child&quot;) isn&#39;t any good for unschooling&#39;s peaceful future.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m all mixed up and haven&#39;t read these in order, but sometimes the  <br/>
truth of a word doesn&#39;t mean it can be used without wrong impressions.<br/>
<br/>
In our family, as activities and learning go, in the overall picture  <br/>
of the last 21 years, I have &quot;led&quot; BIGTIME, but what I did was to  <br/>
lead us all toward unschooling.  We didn&#39;t muddle toward it  <br/>
accidentally as a family.  I designed and created the situation  <br/>
(given what I had to work with, which pretty wonderfully included  <br/>
Keith having recently gotten a really good job, and us having been  <br/>
involved in the SCA a long time) and made sure I really knew what I  <br/>
was doing (or trying to do).<br/>
<br/>
There was no &quot;group lead&quot; on that.  I think someone in the family  <br/>
needs to feel responsible for making sure there&#39;s cohesion and  <br/>
momentum.    I wanted momentum.  When it wasn&#39;t there already, I add  <br/>
more.<br/>
<br/>
Still.  Now that our kids are all practically grown (Kirby IS grown;  <br/>
21 and living elsewhere), momentum doesn&#39;t have to be monitored in  <br/>
half-hour blocks, but maybe in two-day blocks.  And sometimes they  <br/>
have so much planned and happening that all I need to do is check to  <br/>
make sure they have the clothes they need for jobs, friends&#39;  <br/>
weddings, trips; that the car-sharing plans will work out (we&#39;re two  <br/>
cars for four people, kind of; Keith has a motorcycle, and there&#39;s a  <br/>
van without air conditioning that sucks gasoline like a van and Holly  <br/>
and I don&#39;t like to drive it anyway, so I dont&#39; count that)...  I&#39;m  <br/>
more background logistics some weeks than big planner.<br/>
<br/>
As to being the person who make sure it&#39;s all happening, though, the  <br/>
director-style leader, that&#39;s me.  But their learning isn&#39;t &quot;led&quot; by  <br/>
me.  Sometimes it is nudged or augmented or sparkled up by me.<br/>

perhaps following the child around picking up the trash they strew on<br/>

not necessarily in the martyr sort of way.  More in the &quot;why didn&#39;t I<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1483840542">&quot;I&#39;m not sure exactly why you think child-led or child-directed leaves<br/>
the parent out of the equation. If the child chooses his/her own<br/>
explorations than that is the beginning (not that it Always in every<br/>
circumstance has to be), thus the child-led and then the guiding from<br/>
the parent if needed can come into play.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Children are always choosing their own explorations.  Parents are the<br/>
ones who either help or hinder that process.  Unschooling parents should<br/>
be helping in that process, not sitting back and watching it happen, but<br/>
actively participating on all levels.  A parent shouldn&#39;t always wait<br/>
for their kid to ask for something, a parent can observe and be actively<br/>
involved to varying degrees, and see where things can be expanded and<br/>
throw it out there.<br/>
<br/>
A child might not have thought to add little animals to the legos, but a<br/>
parent can certainly enhance the play by doing so.  Or for older kids,<br/>
like my daughter, 14, never would have thought there were underage<br/>
nightclubs, unless I had told her and showed her and found all the<br/>
information, because she was/is interested in the 80&#39;s club scene and<br/>
curious to know if such things still existed.<br/>
<br/>
The actual phrasing is really what I was talking about though and what<br/>
it implies.  &quot;Child-led&quot; leaves the parent out.  It doesn&#39;t say &quot;parent<br/>
and child-led&quot; or &quot;child-leading-parent&quot; or any other thing with the<br/>
word parent in there.  Even more so, it implies that the child is the<br/>
center and everything and everyone else evolves around that.  That<br/>
simply isn&#39;t how it has come to play out in our house.  We are a family<br/>
where our children are certainly coming first in lots of ways, and<br/>
definitely we center ourselves around our children, but not because they<br/>
are leading, but because they are equal members in the household.<br/>
<br/>
More traditional parenting dismisses children outright in their role in<br/>
the family, they are small and unheard.  The parents lead, the opposite<br/>
would be the child leading and that very much gives the wrong impression<br/>
of what actually happens in an unschooling household where everyone<br/>
works together, and those younger are relying on those that are older<br/>
and have more experience.</div>

I&#39;m sure that happens, but it&#39;s not specifically an unschooling issue.&nbsp; Moms who tell the husband one thing (to protect their own&nbsp;status quo) and&nbsp;girlfriends another (to fit in), will do it&nbsp;in every possible way.&nbsp;&nbsp;They&#39;re&nbsp;choosing to live a lie, or several.&nbsp; And they&#39;re&nbsp;likely lying to both their husband and their friends. &nbsp;They would find a way to live that double life of&nbsp;deception even without unschooling.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s much more about a lack of integrity than about unschooling.<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;child led&quot; puts and ugly light on it.  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve been reading along with this thread and absently thinking in the back  <br/>
of my mind that though I don&#39;t vocalize that we do child-led  <br/>
learning/homeschooling (though I do use that as an opener if one of my family  uses <br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot; in reference to a stranger&#39;s questioning... more as a  beginning <br/>
explanation of what unschooling is in simple terms), I&#39;m thinking I  kind of think of us <br/>
a child-led. Our oldest child, Wyl, *definitely* led us  to unschooling. I <br/>
tend to &quot;run amok&quot; and go full-steam ahead, take control and  such when I get an <br/>
idea in my head, so I tend to &quot;control&quot; myself, sit back a  lot and watch. <br/>
Watch for interests, openings, places I can drop tid bits or toss  some casual <br/>
idea in. But, as I&#39;m reading and pausing more to think in the  &quot;forefront&quot; of <br/>
my head, I&#39;m thinking that maybe the idea that we&#39;re child-lead  is more of a <br/>
surface-perception kind of thing. As in, if I compare it to how I  was <br/>
envisioning homeschooling: colored pencils, crayons, big-lined paper,  charts, fun <br/>
workbooks, mama-led *teaching* to how things look *now*, on the  surface, at a <br/>
quick glance, it *might* seem child-led, but it really is a  wonderful dance. A <br/>
give-and-take... lead and fall back... a swirling-round of  first one person <br/>
in the lead, then someone else, always moving in and out of  formation, never <br/>
still. I chuckle to myself as I think &quot;unschooling is poetry in  motion&quot;... not <br/>
really where I was intending on going, but the thought-process is  still <br/>
swirling in itself.<br/>
 <br/>
Great thread-thanks for everyone&#39;s input... it helped me see beyond!<br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>

posts. They are aware of it and say they are working on it - it has  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-970381639">My own situation, fwiw.<br/>
<br/>
In relation to school, I usually describe my &#39;out of school&#39; son as<br/>
&quot;self-educated&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
When I started my blog recently, however, I chose &quot;self-motivated<br/>
learner&quot; because I wanted a term that could be applied to everyone in<br/>
my family.<br/>
<br/>
My wife is an Associate Lecturer at the Australian National University<br/>
and has an MBA that she acquired by distance learning. I&#39;m a high<br/>
school dropout with no formal qualifications. Our daughter is an<br/>
always schooled university graduate. Our son went to school for two<br/>
years and has been at home with me for the past five and he decides<br/>
for himself what he&#39;s interested in and what he isn&#39;t. Only one of us<br/>
would be recognised as &#39;unschooled&#39; but we&#39;re all self-motivated<br/>
learners. <br/>
<br/>
For me, self-motivated learning means &quot;don&#39;t wait for somebody else to<br/>
decide they want to teach you&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
How that fits in with parenting: my wife and I honour our children&#39;s<br/>
self-authority (&quot;Only I know what&#39;s best for me&quot;) and we expect them<br/>
to honour ours. That manifests in a tendency for everyone to do what<br/>
they like and not do what they don&#39;t like. Including go to school or<br/>
don&#39;t go to school. The existence of school or no school as an option<br/>
is incidental in itself. My son is out of school because of what my<br/>
wife and I believe about parenting, not because of what we believe<br/>
about school.<br/>
<br/>
Before my daughter started school at the age of five, she had the same<br/>
lifestyle of maximum freedom her brother has now; after she started<br/>
school, it became a part-time lifestyle. At all times she was out of<br/>
school, she was free to do what she liked and not do what she didn&#39;t<br/>
like. She continued to choose her own bedtime even when she was at<br/>
school the next day and she chose to do her school homework. She was<br/>
never once asked to do it, she did it anyway. Whenever she wanted a<br/>
day off school, she had a day off school no questions asked, and I<br/>
would happily fabricate the &#39;sick note&#39; she was required to give to<br/>
her teacher the next day. <br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s impossible for my wife and I not to have influenced our<br/>
children&#39;s decisions about their own lives to some degree through the<br/>
decisions we&#39;ve made about what we want for ourselves. Which includes<br/>
happy and successful children. Whatever we&#39;ve perceived that to mean.<br/>
We&#39;ve never &#39;told&#39; our children to do anything, but our conversations<br/>
with them have often included suggestions and recommendations. Should<br/>
our children choose to ignore or reject our alleged &#39;wisdom&#39;, we<br/>
accept that and move on. There are occasions when we continue to<br/>
believe we&#39;re right and we&#39;ll come back later to the same subject, and<br/>
then it&#39;s up to us to make our case. In conversations on the same<br/>
subject over time, our children will occasionally change their minds,<br/>
and often they won&#39;t. It&#39;s okay either way. But, we want what we want,<br/>
the same as our children want what they want, and that&#39;s always going<br/>
to be part of the equation.<br/>

&gt; I hear the phrase &quot;child-led&quot; or &quot;child-directed&quot; a lot in the <br/>
&gt; context of unschooling, either by non-unschoolers trying to describe <br/>
&gt; unschooling or by unschoolers trying to describe unschooling to those <br/>
&gt; that know nothing about it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The main issue that I have with those terms is that it leaves the <br/>
&gt; parent out of the equation.  I&#39;ve never used it for that reason, and <br/>
&gt; also because what we do at our house looks nothing like what those <br/>
&gt; phrases imply.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I very much lead my kids.  As my older daughter has gotten older, <br/>
&gt; she&#39;s done more and more of her own leading, but I still do a lot of <br/>
&gt; initiating of things.  Actually as I&#39;m writing this, I&#39;m aware of the <br/>
&gt; fact that the word &quot;lead&quot; is somewhat not the right word.  I <br/>
&gt; think &quot;guide&quot; might be a better word all around.  I don&#39;t guide by <br/>
&gt; compulsion, but more like a guidance counselor would do it, listen <br/>
&gt; and watch and observe and offer direction and help as needed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I also have issues with &quot;radical&quot; unschooling too.  We either <br/>
&gt; unschool or we don&#39;t.  Unschooling is extremely radical for most <br/>
&gt; people already.  I also don&#39;t buy into the idea that any parent can <br/>
&gt; unschool curriculum and not extend it farther into other areas of <br/>
&gt; life and have unschooling work effectively (and I think this is what <br/>
&gt; some mean when they say they unschool but not radically).  My own <br/>
&gt; experience says that it can&#39;t be done without seriously damaging the <br/>
&gt; parent/child relationship and trust issues that really make <br/>
&gt; unschooling work as awesomely as it does.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Unschooling really seems more about relationships all around.  Which <br/>
&gt; is mostly why &quot;child-led&quot; or &quot;child-directed&quot; is so problematic.  I <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know if John Holt ever intended unschooling to be what I&#39;ve <br/>
&gt; come to know it as, but he certainly planted the seeds of change in <br/>
&gt; the way we can raise our kids without forcible teaching.<br/>

On one hand, it&#39;s good to get people interested and not make them  <br/>
uncomfortable.  It&#39;s courteous to stay in their comfort level,  <br/>
especially if it&#39;s just a casual question from someone who doesn&#39;t  <br/>
even have kids.<br/>
<br/>
It would be discourteous and dishonest, though, if a person with  <br/>
children who was seriously considering homeschooling asked you and  <br/>
you didn&#39;t eventually (while she&#39;s still curious) let her know that  <br/>
it goes beyond academics for your children and that when learning  <br/>
isn&#39;t scheduled, unschooling is all the time.<br/>
