<div id="ygrps-yiv-331100839">We came back from a really neat weekend. We attended the Boston Science <br/>
Fiction film Marathon (24 Hours). I took Julian for the second year, and my <br/>
best friend Melissa, from CT, took her son Nick. Julian and Nick are best <br/>
friends, born 4 days apart.  Melissa and I attended the Marathon together <br/>
when we were in college, then last year we took the boys. It was fun, some <br/>
very cool movies. And Nick will be here with us for the week.<br/>
<br/>
Nick started attending a Sudbury Valley near Hartford this year, and is very <br/>
happy with it. We like it because he has more flexibility about visiting us <br/>
than when he was in public school, and because Nick is SOOOO happy with his <br/>
new school. <br/>
