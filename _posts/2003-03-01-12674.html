&lt;&lt;      Anyway, I am hoping this list will help me to stay committed to <br/>
 what I know is right for my family...Unschooling!!!  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well, this list is full of very dedicated radical unschoolers!! No problem <br/>
there...:)<br/>
I recognize you from unschooling.com, welcome. If you want a die hard group <br/>
of unschoolers, this is the place.<br/>

me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1079379483">I have just finished my first year of Home Schooling. I started out <br/>
with my son who is soon to be 16 and has autism. Then my daughter <br/>
jumped on the band wagon after Hurricanes hit my lovely state of <br/>
Florida.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is the one I am needing to Un-School. My son likes the <br/>
patterns and schedlue set down by text book learning (we do some <br/>
unconventional things as well). But my daughter needs to unwind (as <br/>
does Mommy) and find the joys of a relaxed method of teaching her.<br/>
<br/>
However, &quot;I&quot; am the one finding it difficult to do the relaxing in my <br/>
teachings to her. Any advice or tips would be appreciated. I can be E-<br/>
mailed off the loop, as not to tie up the group with my needs only. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!</div>

The best part of about loops, though, is that others who are new or too shy  <br/>
to ask or just need reminders get to take advantage of the responses!<br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
#1, stop having &quot;teachings to her.&quot;<br/>
That will do it, if you just remember not to have teachings.<br/>
You could have learnings with her, or discussions, and still be headed in a  <br/>
good unschooling direction.  <br/>
