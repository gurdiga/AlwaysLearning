<div id="ygrps-yiv-1163095557">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;he sent me a long, full page typed letter, signed<br/>
it cute, sent me photostatic copies (pre-Xerox) of his<br/>
publicity shots, and a <br/>
full front section of a newspaper he was on/in<br/>
(Chelsea news?  I have it all somewhere, but not all<br/>
in one place.)  <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a copy on the wall here in my office.  <br/>
<br/>
it starts off &quot;Dear Sandra, <br/>
When I called in this, my manager&#39;s office, a few<br/>
moments ago I was handed my very first American fan<br/>
letter - and it was from you.  I was so pleased <br/>
that I had to sit down and type an immediate<br/>
reply...&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Wow! I&#39;m a teensy bit envious.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;It was 1967.  My friends would come over and say<br/>
&quot;Yeah, but who IS he?&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I saw him in 1973 (or end of &#39;72?) and my friends were<br/>
saying the same thing. Nobody in my age group had<br/>
heard of him.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;It was weird, and interesting&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I still find a lot of his music weird and interesting<br/>
(bar some of his eighties stuff - not my cup of tea).<br/>
That&#39;s one of the reasons I still have a &#39;crush&#39; on<br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;When he came to Santa Fe to film The Man Who Fell<br/>
to Earth a couple of years later, my friends were<br/>
saying &quot;GO MEET HIM!&quot;  I didn&#39;t.  I was <br/>
embarrassed or afraid he wouldn&#39;t remember me or<br/>
something, and I didn&#39;t care as much then as I had<br/>
before. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh no! I wouldn&#39;t have passed up that opportunity in a<br/>
million years. But then again, I still care. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;The letter was sweet.  I had offered to start a<br/>
fan club.  He said &quot;There is a Fan Club here in<br/>
England, but if things go well in the States then <br/>
we&#39;ll have one there I suppose.  It&#39;s a little early<br/>
to even think about it. &quot;I hope one day to get to<br/>
America.  my manager tells me lots about it as he <br/>
has been there many times with other acts he manages. <br/>
I was watching an old film on TV the other night<br/>
called &quot;No Down Payment&quot; a great film, but rather<br/>
depressing if it is a true reflection of The American<br/>
Way of Life.  <br/>
However, shortly after that they showed a documentary<br/>
about Robert Frost the American <br/>
poet, filmed mainly at his home in Vermont, and that<br/>
evened the score.  I am <br/>
sure that that is nearer the real America...&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
LOL!! He had no idea how mega huge he would be!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I didn&#39;t buy any more of his albums, anyway--by<br/>
the time he was openly available I was immersed in<br/>
folk music.  I bought some current acoustic stuff<br/>
(Elton John, Joni Mitchell, Carol King), but mostly I<br/>
was collecting field recordings of traditional stuff<br/>
ballads and everyday songs.  Then I got involved in<br/>
Renaissance music, and I had a sexy, funny boyfriend<br/>
from India and... one thing lead to another and here I<br/>
am now hanging out with you guys!<br/>
<br/>
Sandra&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve got most of his albums still - I had all of them<br/>
but the afformentioned half-sister stole some of them!<br/>
I think Bowie is one of the main reasons I was<br/>
interested in going to England (not to meet him -<br/>
although that would have been a bonus, but to check<br/>
out the culture and the music!). Then I met my ex (a<br/>
musician, of course!), and stayed there for 12 years!<br/>
Funny, where my &#39;crush&#39; led me &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
