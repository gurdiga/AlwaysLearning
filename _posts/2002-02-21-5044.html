<div id="ygrps-yiv-1780390221">My son used to become frustrated a lot when learning<br/>
new skills.  Dh and I would try to demonstrate or show<br/>
him &quot;the right way&quot;, ie. how to hold a baseball bat. <br/>
Whenever we did this, he would just drop his head &<br/>
his bat & not want to play anymore.  Duh!  What helped<br/>
the most was for us to stop telling him how to do it. <br/>
We also verbalize what we are doing, especially when<br/>
making mistakes, so he could see us not performing<br/>
&quot;perfectly&quot; every time. (modeling imperfection)  Over<br/>
time he was able to &quot;miss&quot; hitting the ball & instead<br/>
of &quot;quitting&quot;, he&#39;d just say &quot;oops, missed it, I&#39;ll<br/>
try again&quot;.  When I miss the ball, he says &quot;good try<br/>
mom.&quot;  <br/>
