<div id="ygrps-yiv-27425276">This kind of relates to the thread about our kids in public places and I<br/>
thought I&#39;d share an observation I&#39;ve had recently with my own son.<br/>
 <br/>
Before I took limits off of TV and video games, it used to really bother<br/>
me when we went to the dentist or hair cutters and the TV was on in the<br/>
waiting area or the kids had an opportunity to play video games while<br/>
they waited or got their hair cut.  &quot;How will they ever learn to just be<br/>
with their own company and not have to be constantly entertained?&quot;  I<br/>
thought.  (I was deschooling from my Waldorf influences.)  Then I<br/>
learned more about unschooling and gradually released control of my<br/>
children&#39;s viewing and gaming habits.  After that, when we&#39;d go to one<br/>
of these places, I appreciated that my children had something they<br/>
enjoyed doing while waiting.  But secretly (dang that Waldorf!) I think<br/>
I still wondered whether they would ever be content with doing these<br/>
mundane things without constant distraction.  <br/>
 <br/>
Well, just recently I took my boys to get their hair cut at one of those<br/>
kids&#39; places with the games at each station.  When my 9 year old was<br/>
asked which game he wanted to play while getting his hair cut, he said,<br/>
&quot;None.  I don&#39;t want to play right now.&quot;  Judging from her reaction, I<br/>
don&#39;t think the hairdresser had ever heard a boy turn down the<br/>
opportunity to play video games.  During the haircut he engaged her in<br/>
conversation, chatting about his new dog and how he wanted his hair cut.<br/>
Then today, he had a dentist appointment.  They&#39;ve always had video<br/>
games in the waiting room, but they&#39;ve recently added some features to<br/>
the examine rooms as well.  There are now Gameboys at each chair and DVD<br/>
screens mounted on the ceiling that the kids can watch while laying flat<br/>
on their backs.  When offered the Gameboy, Connor declined.  Then when<br/>
the assistant lowered him on his back she switched on the DVD player<br/>
without even asking.  When he saw it come on, he said, &quot;I don&#39;t want to<br/>
watch anything.  Can you turn that off, please?&quot;   Again, judging by the<br/>
staff&#39;s reaction, I don&#39;t think they&#39;ve experienced that very often.<br/>
So my no-limit boy is indeed setting his own internal limits and<br/>
surprising a great many adults with his choices along the way!<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks to all those who have walked this path ahead of me and helped me<br/>
gain the confidence to just trust my kids,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1865197136">Thanks for posting this, Sunday. I still struggle with this issue a <br/>
lot. Some days my kids turn the TV off and start playing together or <br/>
with toys by themselves, and some days the TV is on most of the day. <br/>

off, which they&#39;re usually quite eager to do. (&quot;Do you mind if we turn <br/>

My mom used to make me stop reading books because it was bothering  <br/>
her that I was reading longer than she would have.<br/>
<br/>
Granted, reading a book doesn&#39;t make as much noise as a TV does.  But  <br/>
the parental control is the same.<br/>
<br/>
Is your house big enough that you could get away from the TV?  Can  <br/>
you put a TV in a place where you can get away from it?<br/>
<br/>

all the time.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re looking for the result &quot;Children set their own limits,&quot;  <br/>
unschooling probably isn&#39;t the way to go.<br/>
If you&#39;re looking for the result &quot;Children make thoughtful choices,&quot;  <br/>
it can be fantastic!<br/>
<br/>
Their thoughtful choices might not look like the limits you imagined  <br/>
and hoped they might set to please you, though.<br/>

Thanks for adding this, Sandra.  After I posted yesterday, I was<br/>
thinking that it wasn&#39;t really about Connor setting his own limits.<br/>
Making thoughtful choices is a much better way to describe it.  <br/>

I really love this distinction.  That has indeed been a huge part of my<br/>
journey -- letting go of MY expectations of what their choices should<br/>
look like.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>The question I asked, though, wasn&#39;t really for someone like you,  <br/>
then. It was a question (to ask of themselves) for those who ARE  <br/>
having a hard time with letting their kids watch a lot of tv, who say  <br/>
that the tv being on &quot;all the time&quot; bothers them, who find that it is  <br/>
difficult for them to accept that watching tv is really great for  <br/>
their kids. The question was intended for those who are either still  <br/>
restricting/limiting tv or are still finding that they have an urge  <br/>
to do so.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of parents&#39; thinking is clouded when it comes to tv because they  <br/>
are not seeing tv and their children directly, themselves, but are  <br/>
seeing them through a veil composed of all kinds of scary, negative  <br/>
warnings from &quot;experts&quot; about how terrible tv is for kids. Quite a  <br/>
few of us conscientious parents could not, without real effort, look  <br/>
very directly at our own kids or use our own brains to take an  <br/>
unbiased look directly at tv and really think for ourselves about its  <br/>
effect on our kids. &quot;TV&quot; has so much scary negativity built up around  <br/>
it and so many parents are so convinced that tv-watching is going to  <br/>
rot their kids&#39; brains, turn their kids into addicts, make the kids  <br/>
stupid, prevent them from learning to read, entice them to violence,  <br/>
make them insensitive to violence, create avaricious and  <br/>
materialistic uber-consumers out of them, or, at least, turn them  <br/>
into smart-ass, rude kids like on some sitcoms.<br/>
<br/>
One way to address some of those fears is to replace &quot;TV&quot; with  <br/>
something else (like &quot;math&quot;) and see how you&#39;d react to that?<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers talk a lot about trusting our children. Children, usually  <br/>
hyper-sensitive to hypocrisy in their adults, aren&#39;t likely to miss  <br/>
it that their trust doesn&#39;t extend to choosing what and when to watch  <br/>
tv.<br/>
<br/>
Someone asked me at the Live and Learn Conference if I was saying  <br/>
that they couldn&#39;t be unschoolers if they didn&#39;t have tv in their house.<br/>
<br/>
Two part answer:<br/>
1. Is tv really harmful? Are you willing to honestly assess that  <br/>
assumption? Are you willing to think for yourself about your own  <br/>
unschooled child? Have you really logically thought through the  <br/>
supposed dangers of tv and rationally, logically, examined how they  <br/>
would really apply in your own real lives? Do you feel defensive  <br/>
about limiting tv? Why? Can you let go of your &quot;position&quot; long enough  <br/>
to truly consider the possibility that the limits and restrictions  <br/>
might be harmful while tv might, in fact, provide many wonderful and  <br/>
enriching experiences? I have evidence that tv is not necessarily  <br/>
harmful - the evidence is my own three unschooled kids who have grown  <br/>
up with unrestricted tv. They are voracious readers, articulate,  <br/>
smart, nonviolent, nongreedy, courteous young adults.<br/>
<br/>
2. As unschoolers, does &quot;trust the children&quot; really permeate your  <br/>
household or is it a cute slogan to be ignored when parents feel a  <br/>
little anxious? If you take your role as an unschooling parent  <br/>
seriously, how can you possibly justify restricting or limiting  <br/>
something that is SO wonderful as tv can be. And, especially, if your  <br/>
child LOVES watching tv, how can you call yourself an unschooler who  <br/>
supports your child&#39;s interests, if you are limiting him/her in  <br/>
pursuing the very thing he/she is passionately interested in?<br/>
<br/>
If your circumstances don&#39;t allow tv and/or if your kids truly have  <br/>
no interest in it, then you can unschool without a tv. But if you&#39;re  <br/>
restricting tv because of unfounded fears, then I think it does  <br/>
contradict unschooling to keep such a grand part of the world, such  <br/>
an amazing window to all kinds of things, away from your kids. John  <br/>
Holt said, &quot;Bring the world to our kids and our kids to the world.&quot;  <br/>
TV is a spectacular way to do that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2129328338">Pam, <br/>
Thank you for your reply.  It is a question for someone like me.  I <br/>
have a really hard time with so much tv.  It&#39;s not my favorite <br/>
activity, but I got a tv for my daughter (4) and I do not restrict <br/>
it.  <br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;If they were watching a math show on tv, a series of math <br/>
lectures...&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
  I just meant that replacing it with any other show (in my head) <br/>
wouldn&#39;t work for me because I find all that schooly stuff so <br/>
irritating.  One reason I&#39;m not sending her to school is so that she <br/>
doesn&#39;t have to have all these numbers and letters shoved down her <br/>
throat.  But it doesn&#39;t seem to bother her.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s <br/>
really free choice if you can only choose PBS or a movie, but that&#39;s <br/>
all I can afford right now.  <br/>
I no longer believe all the negative things you mentioned, but the <br/>
amount of time is irritating.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;The question I asked, though, wasn&#39;t really for someone like you, <br/>
then. It was a question (to ask of themselves) for those who ARE   <br/>
having a hard time with letting their kids watch a lot of tv&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what you mean by someone like me, but perhaps I <br/>
shouldn&#39;t have said anything?  I am having a hard time with it (why I <br/>
said &quot;I think it would be easier for me to tolerate if it was just <br/>
entertaining.&quot;), I was just mentioning that the problem I have is <br/>
different than I thought it would be.<br/>
<br/>
Is it really great?  I don&#39;t know.  I liked our life before we got <br/>
tv, but maybe she likes it more now.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
~Amy<br/>

Does she know how to turn the TV off?    If not, can she look away,  <br/>
or walk away?<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling shouldn&#39;t be the absence of anything that is discussed or  <br/>
valued in school.  It&#39;s about choices and alternate means of  <br/>
acquisition of the same kinds of information kids learn in school,  <br/>
and then tons-and-much more!<br/>
<br/>
If an unschooling family avoids  numbers and letters, how will a  <br/>
child learn?<br/>
<br/>
If someone is singing and playing and dancing about numbers and  <br/>
letters, how is that &quot;shoving down throats&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Look at the little video on this page, which all my kids have seen  <br/>
lots of times because it was on our best of Sesame Street video (home  <br/>
made collection of people&#39;s favorite bits):<br/>

It doesn&#39;t have to be that one person&#39;s happiness is made of another  <br/>

Are you saying tv is overly &quot;educational&quot; for your taste?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m having trouble understanding how a tv can get only PBS and  <br/>
movies? If you can get PBS, why don&#39;t you get other channels? But,  <br/>
PBS is awesome - there is enough programming just on PBS to keep a  <br/>
family happy for many many hours.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; different than I thought it would be.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Assuming you mean that PBS seems overly educational to you, another  <br/>
thing for you to ask yourself is whether that is not just your own  <br/>
baggage, having felt learning was being forced on you. Your child  <br/>
doesn&#39;t have that baggage, of course, and, to her, tv is a choice  <br/>
(unlike schooling was for you). PBS doesn&#39;t seem at all overly  <br/>
educational to me - it seems filled with wondrous information and  <br/>
ideas and the chance for me to learn a lot in a really pleasurable  <br/>
way. But, I&#39;ve long ago gotten over being resistant to learning (I&#39;m  <br/>
55 years old and have grown unschooled kids). Sounds, to me, like  <br/>
you&#39;re likely still in reactive mode - still hurt by what school did  <br/>
to you. I don&#39;t feel that even the most overtly educational programs  <br/>
on PBS are shoving anything down kids&#39; throats - not as long as there  <br/>
is a power button on the tv &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Is it really great? I don&#39;t know. I liked our life before we got<br/>
&gt; tv, but maybe she likes it more now.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is she stopping you from doing the things you used to do? Is that  <br/>
because she wants to watch certain shows? Then, yeah, that&#39;s because  <br/>
she likes watching those shows more than whatever else it is that you  <br/>
want her to be doing. So, her life is better.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes people don&#39;t do stuff, though, because they think the kid  <br/>
is happy watching tv -- so parents don&#39;t provide as great an  <br/>
environment as they would have without tv. It isn&#39;t the tv&#39;s fault,  <br/>
or the child&#39;s fault, but the parents who are not doing their best to  <br/>
offer a rich and full and stimulating life to their child.<br/>
<br/>
So, there could be some guilt on the parents part that they are not  <br/>
paying enough attention to their child, not offering an interesting  <br/>
enough life.<br/>
<br/>
Also, parents sometimes feel tv is coming between them and their  <br/>
child - the parent claims not to like tv, but clearly the child does.  <br/>
The parent ought to be supporting that interest and getting involved  <br/>
and cuddling up and watching together and talking about it later and  <br/>
building on it -- you might be finding dress-ups that relate to a  <br/>
favorite show or character, you might find related books or games or  <br/>
toys, you might make foods that were on a tv show -- supporting a  <br/>
child&#39;s interests doesn&#39;t mean support everything except tv, but a  <br/>
lot of times parents seem to have a very hands-off attitude about tv  <br/>
as if it was something done by the child, in isolation. Then they  <br/>
blame the tv for the child being isolated.<br/>
<br/>
If it seems that PBS is shoving education down kids&#39; throats, what  <br/>
about science centers or museums? Do they feel the same way?<br/>
<br/>
This seems like a throwing the baby out with the bathwater kind of  <br/>
response.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t LEARNING that is problematic, it is the attempt to coerce  <br/>
it. When people have choice, they LOVE to learn and don&#39;t develop the  <br/>
kind of resistance to it that you seem to be experiencing.<br/>
<br/>
Sesame Street, for example, is fun and enjoyable for lots of kids  <br/>
because of the learning that it entails. Kids LOVE to learn when they  <br/>
aren&#39;t being forced, assigned, graded, tested, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, it IS great! Wondrous. Wish you could see it through my  <br/>
husband&#39;s eyes - he didn&#39;t have any tv growing up - I mean, there  <br/>
were not ANY tv&#39;s where he lived, he didn&#39;t see one until he was at  <br/>
least 12 years old and then only little bitty black and whites. He  <br/>
never saw a color tv until he was in his 20&#39;s. HE knows how to  <br/>
appreciate the wonder of a big color tv.<br/>

<br/>
Good question.<br/>
What they&#39;re watching on TV might be the very best choice.  It might  <br/>
be something that&#39;s just on while they&#39;re playing something else.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Thoughtful choices is what I mean. I was just following the verbiage<br/>
used in the original post. -=-<br/>
<br/>
It might be interesting to think about those two statements together.<br/>
Making thoughtful choices of words and phrasing when posting is what  <br/>
makes the difference between a so-so or confusing post and something  <br/>
really useful or inspiring.<br/>
<br/>
-=I actually get headaches sometimes from the TV. I<br/>
know this, because once it&#39;s off, the headache goes away.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible the headache is from stress, frustration, and your  <br/>
inability to relax about the TV?<br/>
<br/>
If not, what about headphones, for one child who might be watching a  <br/>
show?<br/>
<br/>
-=-So far neither child has ever had a problem with turning it off<br/>

<br/>
Because they&#39;re doing something nice for you?<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m answering posts on the list like this one, or working on my  <br/>
webpages, or folding laundry or watching a movie, I&#39;m probably going  <br/>
to keep doing that until I get tired of it, or until someone asks me  <br/>
to do something for them.  If it&#39;s someone I care about, I&#39;ll be glad  <br/>
to quit doing what I&#39;m doing and get back to it later.<br/>
<br/>
If the person kept asking me to do something else for no other reason  <br/>
than to keep me from being online or watching my movie, it wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
be too long before they weren&#39;t on my list of people I really cared  <br/>
about enough to stop anything I&#39;m doing to be with them.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t spend all your points with your kids on things like getting a  <br/>
TV turned off.  Save them for more important things.<br/>

squish them up before putting them in your ears and then they expand  <br/>
and really block out a lot of noise while staying in very well, too.  <br/>
When my husband has been watching a whole lot of football, especially  <br/>
if John Madden is a commentator (his voice rubs me the wrong way), I  <br/>
listen to audible books or to music on my mp3 player.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t that I have no sympathy for those who are sensitive to the  <br/>
noise of a tv on for hours and hours - I get tense, too, and have had  <br/>
tension headaches as a result, myself. I&#39;ve found that if I sit down  <br/>
and watch with them, so that it isn&#39;t background noise that I&#39;m  <br/>
trying, unsuccessfully, to block out, I can relax with it more.<br/>
<br/>
So - there are a couple of strategies that don&#39;t involve interrupting  <br/>
the kids.<br/>
<br/>
Occasionally interrupting them doesn&#39;t seem awful to me, either. What  <br/>
would be awful would be to have a parent constantly complaining that  <br/>
the tv noise was bothering them.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;How is that you only have PBS?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
PBS is the only thing I have that she wishes to watch. I also have <br/>
the regular channels and she does like some of the night time <br/>
shows.  I would love to get satellite or calble, but currently don&#39;t <br/>

I probably wouldn&#39;t be irritated.  Maybe I shouldn&#39;t have said <br/>
irritated.  Slightly annoyed, put off, perhaps?<br/>

of tv with her.  I know when her &quot;very favorites&quot; are on and let her <br/>
know.  I ask her things and point out things.  We giggle together a <br/>

fascinating.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;m sorting.  I don&#39;t say to her, &quot;let&#39;s <br/>
not watch that schooly stuff.&quot;  Or even tell her that it <br/>
(occasionally) irritates me.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;You seem still to be looking at the clock and the TV and the <br/>
school  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and your feelings instead of at your daughter herself.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think that is so.  I try to do what ever my daughter needs or <br/>
wants, even when it&#39;s not something I wish to do.  Sometimes I think <br/>
having all her little neighborhood friends over is irritating too. <br/>
<br/>
Wow, you guys were all over that.  I&#39;ll be sure to keep any <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1443932531">-=-Oh my goodness. I seriously just meant that I thought it was<br/>

<br/>
I think people are assuming you brought it up because you wanted  <br/>
suggestions to keep from being so irritated.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-Right, it&#39;s not a problem. I merely mentioned that I thought it was<br/>
irritating. Just an opinion.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not &quot;just an opinion&quot; if it&#39;s affecting your comfort, your  <br/>
homelife, and the relationship with your children.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not &quot;just an opinion&quot; if you act on it in ways that will make  <br/>
unschooling work less effectively.<br/>
<br/>
-=-If it was the Simpsons or Bugs Bunny,<br/>
I probably wouldn&#39;t be irritated. Maybe I shouldn&#39;t have said<br/>
irritated. Slightly annoyed, put off, perhaps?-=-<br/>
<br/>
If the negativity has to do with content and not actually the sound,  <br/>
then it&#39;s worth being mindful of what you&#39;re feeling and why.   <br/>
Analyzing this situation will help you later when the topic is cars,  <br/>
shoes, friends you don&#39;t know, etc.<br/>

children, and some other things on that page too about trying to be  <br/>
more mindful.<br/>
<br/>
-=PBS is the only thing I have that she wishes to watch. -=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s important to be clear when you tell us what your situation is.   <br/>
You said you only had PBS and movies.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s important when you&#39;re just thinking within yourself, too, to be  <br/>
as clear as you can be.  It&#39;s easy to limit our own thinking  <br/>
artificially and unnecessarily.<br/>
<br/>
-=-It just seems obsessive and constant. Does everything have to be<br/>
about letters and numbers? I really don&#39;t have a problem with<br/>
numbers and letters, I use them everyday.-=-<br/>
<br/>
You already know letters and numbers.  If your daughter likes those  <br/>
things, and watches them, and it bothers you, that&#39;s worth thinking  <br/>
about.<br/>

It&#39;s the parents who need the deschooling most!<br/>

irritations I have off of here. Or try to find a way to phrase it so<br/>
that so many assumptions aren&#39;t made.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Clarity is always best.  Even  if the responses didn&#39;t apply to you,  <br/>
though, there are hundreds of people reading here and some of them  <br/>
probably picked something new and useful up.<br/>

You don&#39;t have to hate the TV, either.  You might want to change your  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL - lots of things on tv can be annoying. Lots of things our kids  <br/>
do can be annoying - parents get lots of opportunities to switch  <br/>
perspective, to see things differently, by looking at them through  <br/>
the eyes of our kids. When something is annoying to us, that&#39;s a  <br/>
prime opportunity for that perspective switch.<br/>
<br/>
Amy, we responded to what you said - didn&#39;t make up things or put  <br/>
words in your mouth.<br/>
You really did say things beyond and much stronger than that there  <br/>
were some things on tv that were occasionally annoying. You said, for  <br/>
example:<br/>
<br/>
&quot; I have a really hard time with so much tv.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
--- a &quot;really hard time&quot; sounds like you&#39;re more than just a bit  <br/>
annoyed by something on tv. And &quot;so much tv&quot; sounds like it is the  <br/>
quantity she wants to watch, not just the content.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot; I find all that schooly stuff so irritating.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
--- &quot;all that schooly stuff meaning all the cool playing and singing  <br/>
and dancing about letters and numbers that your daughter doesn&#39;t  <br/>
think of as schooly, but as just cool playing and singing and dancing  <br/>
about letters and numbers  - letters and numbers are very cool,  <br/>
they&#39;re not &quot;schooly.&quot; Saying, &quot;so irritating,&quot; is a long stronger  <br/>
than just casually commenting that sometimes things on tv are a  <br/>
little annoying.<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;One reason I&#39;m not sending her to school is so that she<br/>
doesn&#39;t have to have all these numbers and letters shoved down her<br/>
throat. But it doesn&#39;t seem to bother her. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
This implies that the singing and dancing and playing with letters  <br/>
and numbers is equivalent to having them shoved down her throat. You  <br/>
said it doesn&#39;t bother her as if what is happening to her is the same  <br/>
as what happens in school.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s really free choice if you can only choose PBS  <br/>
or a movie, but that&#39;s<br/>
all I can afford right now.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now you say, in fact, she has lots of other choices - all the other  <br/>
channels that she mostly chooses not to watch. That&#39;s a LOT of choice.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I no longer believe all the negative things you mentioned, but the<br/>
amount of time is irritating. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like what some parents would say about their kid who loved  <br/>
reading - &quot;Reading is fine and dandy, but I wish she&#39;d do something  <br/>
else once in a while.&quot; As if, first of all, the kid never really did  <br/>
anything else and, second of all, as if the kid&#39;s reading was  <br/>
annoying to the parent.<br/>

  LOL! I have to remove myself from the room when zack & cody, or drake & josh, etc. come on and I&#39;ve already seen the episode half a dozen times (or maybe more). It&#39;s amazing how many times kids can watch the same show (I know it&#39;s a developmental thing and they&#39;re getting something from it). I get to the point where I just can&#39;t watch another of the same episode again. So I go into my bedroom or the garden to read or something.<br/>

<br/>
My kids also only watch PBS Kids and DVDs/videos (and yes, they have <br/>
access to however many channels our DISH service offers, but they <br/>
choose PBS Kids). I don&#39;t find the shows particularly irritating, but <br/>
the little spots between the shows are not always my favorite. All <br/>
the &quot;getting your toddler ready for school&quot; advice and &quot;eating right&quot; <br/>
advice (that my children watch intently). But I&#39;ve found that those are <br/>
good opportunities to discuss what we believe vs. what&#39;s being said. <br/>
It&#39;s also a good time to dicuss different opinions, marketing <br/>
techniques, etc.<br/>

<br/>
There is inertia in tv watching, as there is in lots of other things.  <br/>
It takes energy to make a change/transition to another activity.  <br/>
Also, they have to have another activity in mind, which sometimes  <br/>
they aren&#39;t thinking of that while watching tv.<br/>
<br/>
Parents shouldn&#39;t be trying to entice kids away from tv out of fear  <br/>
that kids are watching too much tv. But they shouldn&#39;t be afraid,  <br/>
either, of helping kids figure out what they really want to be doing  <br/>
with their time, it isn&#39;t some kind of unschooling rule that parents  <br/>
can&#39;t help kids move on if they&#39;re sort of stuck on something. That  <br/>
happens - I&#39;ve seen my kids keep playing a game, for example, past  <br/>
the point of it being fun (at least for one of them). I&#39;ve seen them  <br/>
stick with it when they are frustrated and starting to get angry at  <br/>
each other - they&#39;ve needed some help from me to realize that it was  <br/>
time to think of something else to do. And, some kids are more  <br/>
passive, have less initiative, or some have trouble initiating  <br/>
transitions - parents should be helping out with that.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra has used this example - teachers pull down the shades in a  <br/>
classroom so kids will pay more attention to schoolwork and not be  <br/>
distracted by what is outside the windows. When a parent restricts/ <br/>
limits tv, that is like the teacher pulling down the shades - it is  <br/>
limiting kids&#39; options, not expanding them. So - we don&#39;t want to do  <br/>
that, as unschooling parents, we want to open up the world, not  <br/>
restrict it. But, that doesn&#39;t mean putting tv-watching in some kind  <br/>
of special status and, figuratively speaking, pulling down the shades  <br/>
on the rest of the world so that tv seems the only option, either.  <br/>
Unschooling parents will interact with tv-watching kids and be  <br/>
offering other stuff to them - NOT out of fear or annoyance with the  <br/>
tv, but in order to expand their world.<br/>
<br/>
So - you might say, &quot;When this show is over, do you want to make  <br/>
cookies with me?&quot; (Knowing that a kid really likes to make cookies,  <br/>
maybe has mentioned wanting to make cookies.)&quot; Or, you might say, &quot;I  <br/>
saw a hummingbird outside this morning, want to come look for one  <br/>
with me?&quot;  OR you might strew some toys or building supplies or art  <br/>
supplies around where the kids are watching tv - mine often forgot  <br/>
about the tv when I pulled their big dollhouse out, with all its  <br/>
pieces, or when I put really great colored pencils and exciting  <br/>
coloring books out or pattern blocks or other things. After a while,  <br/>
I&#39;d notice they weren&#39;t really watching tv anymore and ask, &quot;Hey, do  <br/>
you mind if I put some music on?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think all these kinds of approaches are world-expanding, rather  <br/>
than world-limiting, and they don&#39;t spring from fear about tv, but  <br/>
out of a desire to provide a rich environment, with lots of fun  <br/>
options, for the kids.<br/>
<br/>
I think the above approach is a whole lot better than mom complaining  <br/>
that the tv is annoying to her and asking the kids to stop watching.  <br/>
I mean, I don&#39;t really think it is going to hurt them for that to  <br/>
happen on rare occasions. It is how you respond to tv on a regular  <br/>
basis that is really the issue.<br/>
