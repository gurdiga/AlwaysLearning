&gt;Melinda - I am tongue tied.  It&#39;s never affected my speech, except that I am<br/>
&gt;unable to trill my r&#39;s.  My daughter is tt too, and it&#39;s not causing her any<br/>
&gt;problems either.  Every doctor she&#39;s ever seen has mentioned that they could<br/>
&gt;clip it if we&#39;d like.  WHY???  I&#39;d say the only disadvantage is that my<br/>
&gt;tongue gets sore when I eat an ice cream cone :0). ~Rue<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My son Will was tongue-tied, too.  He couldn&#39;t move his tongue beyond <br/>
his gums when he was born.  I tend to blame that for part of our <br/>
difficulties nursing.  We had his frenulum clipped (he didn&#39;t even <br/>
flinch) at 2 weeks, but by then I had given up nursing.  There were a <br/>
whole host of other reasons, too, but I wonder if anybody knows if that <br/>
short frenulum can cause problems.  I think surely it can, but I&#39;ve <br/>
never seen it discussed.<br/>
