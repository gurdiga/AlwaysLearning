<div id="ygrps-yiv-1178712277">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Generally I lurk here and soak up ideas but I need a bit for help from some experienced and articulate unschoolers.  <br/>
<br/>
In New Zealand we are required to apply to the government for an exemption from compulsory schooling in order to keep our children out of school.  The Ministry of Education puts out guidelines for applying and we gather it does refuse up to 10 per cent of applicants.  We are trying to deal with changes to the application pack - or avert the worst aspects of it - and I am struggling to deal with this thorny little clause in the application pack.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Whatever source of curriculum guidance you select, you should be specific about the skills you want your child to learn and you should be clear about the maturity level and abilities of your child in relation to your curriculum.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As you  can see not exactly friendly to unschoolers.  How can I tone it down, argue for its exclusion or advise unschoolers how to cope with it?<br/>
<br/>
Any and all suggestions gratefully received.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
It seems to me that what you might really need is some legal advice from<br/>
qualified people familiar with the education statutes in NZ. They can check<br/>
that the law actually did change, and not just some civil servant&#39;s<br/>
definition of it within the Department. Sometimes here in California the<br/>
Department of Education sends out intimidating sounding letters that are<br/>
actually outside of the statutes, and make excessive demands. Knowing the<br/>
law allows us to just not respond to what is more than the law requires. <br/>
<br/>
I guess in the States here that have reporting, the parents translate the<br/>
daily ordinary living activities into eduationese for their reports, but<br/>
don&#39;t actually make any demands on their children to alter their ways of<br/>
learning. Sometimes people use the education statutes as their curriculum<br/>
guidance for paperwork purposes because of the fantastic word &quot;offer&quot;. They<br/>
must &quot;offer&quot; instruction in various areas - but there is no compulsion on<br/>
anyone to take what is offered!<br/>
<br/>
Looking at this again, I wonder if that statement can be taken as the<br/>
Education department trying to protect kids from being pushed too far, or<br/>
made to do too much work, rather than as a trawling expedition to catch<br/>
Unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers&#39; sources of curriculum guidance are the diverse interests,<br/>
mercurial passions, and personal goals of our individual children. The<br/>
skills we would expect them to attain and master are those which enhance<br/>
their abilities to pursue those interests. While always supported in<br/>
stretching their skills and facilitated in expanding their understanding of<br/>
their areas of enthusiasm, no Unschooler would be expected to advance in any<br/>
area beyond their individual comfort level, nor on any timetable set by<br/>
anyone other than the learner him or herself.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s how I might answer the question - provided I could do so legally.<br/>

Have you seen Carol Narigon&#39;s curriculum? It might fit the bill.<br/>

CAROL NARIGON&#39;S UNSCHOOLING CURRICULUM<br/>
<br/>
In case an unschooler is required to submit a curriculum, here  is one Carol <br/>
wrote, and has generously offered as a model for other families  in need. <br/>
There are variations on this, using California  requirements, below. <br/>
Brandon will use a developmentally-appropriate, integrated curriculum. We  <br/>
will plan his learning together, based on his interests, so I can&#39;t state in  <br/>
advance which specific topical areas we will cover, however we expect to cover  <br/>
the following subjects. <br/>
He will read from self-chosen and parent-chosen literature on a daily basis.  <br/>
He will engage in reflection on those literature pieces in one or many of the <br/>
 following ways: journal writing, book reviews, conversations, drama based on <br/>
the  books, book clubs. My goal is for Brandon to continue to enjoy reading, <br/>
to read  for pleasure, to gain exposure to a wide variety of genres, and to be <br/>
able to  reflect critically on what he reads.  <br/>
Brandon will read content-area non-fiction materials as needed to support his <br/>
 chosen areas of interest. He will reflect on these pieces in one, or many, <br/>
of  the following ways: journal writing, writing an article for submission to a <br/>
 magazine, discussions, development of a scrapbook in an area of interest. My <br/>
 goal is for Brandon to learn to read critically for information, to <br/>
understand  and be able to reflect on the materials he reads and to be able to compare <br/>
them  to other sources of information, and to learn how and where to find <br/>
written  resources as needed. <br/>
Brandon will study science as it relates to the areas of his interests by  <br/>
watching science videos, reading related written materials, conducting  <br/>
scientific experiments, gardening, keeping journals, making and recording  <br/>
observations, visiting scientists in their work places, taking classes at the  Dayton <br/>
Museum of Discovery, participating in science fairs, earning science  merit <br/>
badges through Boy Scouts, visiting museums such as COSI and the  Indianapolis <br/>
Childrenâ€™s Museum and through cooperative classes with our  homeschool group. My <br/>
goal is for Brandon to experience a wide range of  scientific exposure in his <br/>
areas of interest, to develop a positive interest in  science, to learn to <br/>
think scientifically, to develop a respect for the work  scientists do and to <br/>
understand the importance science has in his daily  life. <br/>
Writing, spelling and grammar will be covered as part of Brandon&#39;s writing  <br/>
processes. He expects to write creatively, to write letters and lists, to <br/>
create  and write drama pieces, etc. He will also write in conjunction with Boy <br/>
Scout  merit badges. My goal is for Brandon to enjoy writing, to gain skills in <br/>
both  the writing process and in technical skills required of an edited piece, <br/>
and to  develop a sense of power over the written word. <br/>
History and geography will follow the same plan outlined for the above  <br/>
subjects. Brandon will read historical fiction and non-fiction, participating in  <br/>
field trips such as the Renaissance Festival, Carillon Park, Union Station in  <br/>
Cincinnati and the Fair at New Boston. We expect to integrate history and  <br/>
geography into our study of other subjects through one or many or the following  <br/>
ways: the use of time lines and maps, discussion, journal writing, cooking,  <br/>
plays, road trips, invention building, Scout camping trips and art. My goal is  <br/>
for Brandon to appreciate the nuances and fluidity of history, to recognize <br/>
his  place in history, and to enjoy and understand the importance of his <br/>
knowledge of  history. <br/>
Health, physical education and safety will be continued as a part of our  <br/>
daily living skills. Brandon will learn to care for his body and his physical  <br/>
environment through one or many of the following ways: shopping for and  <br/>
preparing food, discussing the necessity of a healthy diet, participation in  fire <br/>
drills and other emergency preparedness, exercise both as play and as part  of a <br/>
structured group experience, and through Boy Scout camping, merit badges  and <br/>
classes. My goal is for Brandon to appreciate the necessity of a healthy  <br/>
body and to learn to care for his body&#39;s needs as he understands them. <br/>
Brandon will learn art and music through both self-chosen and structured  <br/>
methods including one, or many, of the following: art classes at Rosewood, DAI,  <br/>
or the K-12 Gallery, piano and guitar lessons, choral singing, listening to  <br/>
various styles of music, learning through reading and videos about the people  <br/>
who have influenced music through history, and working on self-chosen art  <br/>
projects and Boy Scout badges that relate to music and art. He has been and will  <br/>
continue to be active as an actor and performer in various community theaters <br/>
in  the Dayton area. My goal is for Brandon to appreciate a wide variety of <br/>
art and  music experiences, including performance, while understanding the <br/>
importance of  art and music as it pertains to history. In addition, he will be <br/>
spending time  at our family framing and print store where he will meet a <br/>
variety of artists  and learn about many facets of the art business. <br/>
Brandon will learn math through participation in daily livingâ€”cooking,  <br/>
building, shopping, etc. In addition, he will continue using the Key toâ€¦math  <br/>
series for algebra and geometry as well as Mathematics a Human Endeavor and  <br/>
Algebra by Harold Jacobs. My goal is for Brandon to gain conceptual knowledge of  <br/>
mathematics as well as an appreciation for the daily application of math in his  <br/>
life.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-921907638">I&#39;m not sure if it would help but I bought one just so I could look <br/>
at it - The Life is Learning Curriculum guides- even the author <br/>
admits it&#39;s unnecessary for those who &quot;get&quot; unschooling, but for <br/>
those starting out or for someone who HAS to have a curriculum to <br/>
meet some requirement it could be helpful and it does <br/>
provide &quot;lists&quot; of things children should be doing around certain <br/>
grade levels and give ideas for kids to learn concepts without <br/>
school. It&#39;s availabe through the www.FUN-books.com website. <br/>
Definately look for more resources in your own country though - I <br/>
can&#39;t stress that enough. Moza</div>
