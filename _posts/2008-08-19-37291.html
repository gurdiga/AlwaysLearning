<div id="ygrps-yiv-856103723">On Monday, September 8, 2008, Kim Campbell will nterview me by phone  <br/>
for her Relaxed Homeschooler podcast show.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/RelaxedHomeschooler/">http://www.blogtalkradio.com/RelaxedHomeschooler/</a><br/>
<br/>
The show starts at 10:00 AM Central.  I think if you go to the link  <br/>
above, it will show your own local time in most places.  (If someone  <br/>
could confirm that, I&#39;d appreciate it.  It shows 9:00 AM on my  <br/>
screen, and I&#39;m mountain time.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be on from 10:30 to 11:30 central.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s 8:30 in the morning Pacific time, so I&#39;ll understand if some  <br/>
of you sleep through it.  You can listen afterwards at the website.<br/>
<br/>
You can request an e-mail reminder there at the site, too.<br/>
