<div id="ygrps-yiv-1944682818">I would have LOVED to have one of these, even in black and white, as a  <br/>
kid.    BEAUTIFUL posters with history of Greece, Rome, Byzantium by  <br/>
color images of coins with the faces of the emperors.<br/>
<br/>
Though they&#39;re missing half a dozen of the Byzantine emperors, they  <br/>
have ALL the Romans.   These are awesome:<br/>

There are closeups of some of the coins (lots, because they&#39;re selling  <br/>
them):<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1338246218">Those are real beauties.  Karl and I were just talking the other day <br/>
about dollar bills and coins, and he was surprised when I mentioned <br/>
that lots of country has coins minted and bills printed (it rhymes!).  <br/>
Then he nodded his head like &quot;of course, I knew that&quot; because it makes <br/>
sense, you know.<br/>
