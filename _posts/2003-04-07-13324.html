<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;THIS is how homeschooling should look. I actually started describing <br/>
&gt; &gt;Unschooling (usually don&#39;t bother), and they were enthusiastic.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Did they have children?   (OH, or are THEY the parents of Dumb Fucks 1 &2? <br/>
&gt; Nah!)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve found that the schooled mindset seems to be MUCH more ingrained in <br/>
&gt; PARENTS. My friends who have no children really GET unschooling and are <br/>
&gt; VERY <br/>
&gt; supportive---even the &quot;educators&quot;. It&#39;s as if the DAY you have a child---  <br/>
&gt; &quot;education&quot; becomes all-important. Like they can&#39;t see any further than a <br/>
&gt; good school (and we all know how they sell houses! &lt;g&gt;)!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How weird is THAT?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m sorry for those two children. And glad Julian has you!<br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My aunt and Uncle have two grown children, one of whom is a schoolteacher <br/>
(who thinks homeschooling is cool) and another who works for Brown <br/>
University.<br/>
<br/>
No, the verbally abusive (also physically abusive) parents are Julian&#39;s <br/>
father&#39;s parents.  While not supportive, neither (my ex-fil has now died) has <br/>
ever talked that way to Julian. And Perry and I agreed long ago they would <br/>
never see Julian unsupervised.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you...and we&#39;re SO glad we have Julian. He&#39;s really worked out quite <br/>
nicely ;)<br/>
