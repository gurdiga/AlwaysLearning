<div id="ygrps-yiv-2034900308">We just got back from Wendy&#39;s and, boy, am I mad!  Here&#39;s the story:<br/>
<br/>
Dd(8), ds(5) and I stopped at Wendy&#39;s for lunch after being at the <br/>
zoo for a zoo class all morning.  Unfortunately, Wendy&#39;s was crowded <br/>
with the lunch crowd.  Dd(8) asked if she and brother could go get a <br/>
table and wait while I orderd the food and I agreed.  They were <br/>
sitting where I could see them if I leaned out from the long line I <br/>
was waiting in.  I kept looking back every minute or so and they <br/>
seemed to be doing fine.  Then, it was my turn to order, and <br/>
naturally, that is when something happened.  <br/>
<br/>
I got our food and headed to our table and ds was under the table <br/>
with his coat over his head crying.  I asked him to come out and he <br/>
wouldn&#39;t.  I asked him if he was hurt and Dd said, &quot;No, he got in <br/>
trouble.&quot;  When I asked him to come out and tell me what happened, <br/>
the woman who cleans the table (probably in her 60&#39;s) came over and <br/>
said, &quot;He was licking the salt and pepper shakers and so I had to <br/>
throw them away!&quot;  She was all in a huff.  Ds came out from under the <br/>
table (I was sitting on the floor by him) and crawled in my lap and <br/>
hid his face.  He was obviously very upset.  I asked him if that is <br/>
what he did and he shook his head no.  <br/>
<br/>
then the lady sitting across from our table said in a very mad and <br/>
irritated voice (she was probably also in her 60&#39;s I&#39;m guessing) &quot;do <br/>
you want me to tell you what he did?&quot;  and I replied, &quot;No, I&#39;ll let <br/>
my son tell me.&quot;  She said in a &quot;knowing&quot; sort of way, &quot;Yeah, I <br/>
thought you&#39;d probably want him to tell you&quot; like she thought I&#39;d <br/>
pull the truth out of him and then punish him.<br/>
<br/>
Ds would not tell me what happened.  I felt so upset because part of <br/>
me wanted to find out what happened so that I could make amends, if <br/>
need be, and part of me wanted to just let him be since he was <br/>
obviously so upset.  I told Ds that I promised I would not be mad at <br/>
him no matter what happened and that I was not going to punish him.  <br/>
He still wouldn&#39;t say anything except that he wanted to go home.  So <br/>
we started packing up our food. Dd said, &quot;Mommy, he wasn&#39;t licking <br/>
them, he had them under his nose and was smelling them.&quot;  then she <br/>
demonstrated what he was doing and I knew he was just trying to be <br/>
silly while they were waiting for their food.<br/>
<br/>
I asked Ds if that was true, that he was smelling the shakers, not <br/>
licking them, and he nodded yes.  I asked him what the worker said to <br/>
him and he wouldn&#39;t talk.  The worker lady then came to our table and <br/>
patted his back and said in a sickly sweet voice, &quot;It&#39;s okay.  I <br/>
threw them away.  Don&#39;t be upset.&quot;  Then she bent down and whispered <br/>
wickedly, &quot;But if you do it again, I&#39;ll take you over my knee and <br/>
spank you!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I looked at her and said, &quot;No, you will not spank my child.  I do not <br/>
spank him and you certainly will not spank him.&quot;  She said she was <br/>
only teasing.  I said, &quot;I apologize for what he did, but really it <br/>
was my fault.  I should not have left them unattended at the table <br/>
and we should not have come at such a busy time.  I&#39;m the one who was <br/>
wrong, not my child.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We left and on the way out, another older lady (Man, must be the day <br/>
for older ladies to go to Wendy&#39;s!) caught up with me as we were <br/>
headed to our car and told me that that old worker lady was really <br/>
mean to Matthew and that she said some very unkind things.  She <br/>
called her &quot;That mean old lady&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I also found out that she told Ds that he would have to pay for a new <br/>
set of shakers.  I cannot believe she would tell that to a 5 year <br/>
old!  I am so mad about this situation, and even more upset with <br/>
myself because I don&#39;t think I stood up enough for my child.  I <br/>
should have probably gone to the manager or something.  <br/>
<br/>
How should I have handled this situation?  What could I have done <br/>
differently?  I would like to know if anyone else has experienced <br/>
similar situations and how you handled them so that in the future, <br/>
I&#39;ll be better prepared.  Boy, wish I could just wave a magic wand <br/>
and have all the experience and knowledge some of you have on this <br/>
site!  Being new to unschooling sucks in a way because I have the <br/>
drive and desire, but not the experience or knowledge.<br/>

<br/>
You are mad and I&#39;m sitting here crying for that little boy. I can&#39;t say <br/>
what I would have done. I guess it depends on my mood at that time. I <br/>
think you handled it fine w/ the worker (I have a hard time not getting <br/>
upset and raising my voice). I think that extending the experience to <br/>
talk to the manager right then would have just made it worse for your <br/>
DS. Maybe go back tomorrow and lodge a formal complaint. No one should <br/>
feel they have the right to speak that way to your child. A worker at <br/>
the post office told my son to stop playing w/ those rope things once. I <br/>
flushed and felt upset that he&#39;d taken it upon himself to tell my son to <br/>
stop doing something I didn&#39;t feel was destructive or dangerous. I wish <br/>
I&#39;d said something to the man, but instead I just felt ashamed and got <br/>
upset w/ my own kids. I handled it poorly. I think on the scale of how <br/>
things are handled, you did very well. That old lady comes from a <br/>
different generation. One I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not a part of. I strive to be <br/>
more like you and less like that old bat everyday.<br/>
<br/>
HUGS!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1047880869">Saying the salt had to be thrown away, if they&#39;re disposables, isn&#39;t  <br/>
too unreasonable.  I think Wendy&#39;s uses solid shakers for salt.<br/>
<br/>
Would you like to think that someone&#39;s child had even touched the  <br/>
salt shaker to his nose even a little bit?  If he wanted to smell it,  <br/>
he could have shaken some out into his  hand (a LITTLE bit) and  <br/>
smelled that.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby worked at a pizza place where high school kids showing off for  <br/>
each other did horrible things to the salt and pepper and Parmesan  <br/>
cheese shakers.  Those were washable and not disposable.  Still.   He  <br/>
was surprised (having never gone to school) at how really horrible  <br/>
teenagers could act in such circumstances.   I tell that to suggest  <br/>
that your child probably wasn&#39;t the first and only kid to do  <br/>
something with or to a salt shaker there.<br/>
<br/>
Wendy&#39;s has a responsibility to their customers to keep the place  <br/>
sanitary.  Seriously.<br/>
<br/>
-=-No one should feel they have the right to speak that way to your  <br/>
child. A worker at the post office told my son to stop playing w/  <br/>

upon himself to tell my son to stop doing something I didn&#39;t feel was  <br/>
destructive or dangerous. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Marty pulled one of those things over on himself at a theater once  <br/>
and it was HEAVY.<br/>
<br/>
-=-No one should feel they have the right to speak that way to your  <br/>
child.-=-<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t a good attitude to have, if you expect your children to  <br/>
live in the world.   You might not always be there with them.  Lisa  <br/>
Heyman died just today.<br/>
<br/>
Give your children ways to understand what is expected of them in the  <br/>
world.  No  one has the right to speak that way to your child in your  <br/>
home, but the idea of helping our children grow up well is so that  <br/>
they know how to act when they are NOT at home.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I flushed and felt upset that he&#39;d taken it upon himself to tell  <br/>
my son to stop doing something I didn&#39;t feel was destructive or  <br/>
dangerous.-=-<br/>
<br/>
He was protecting the property in his place of work and the safety of  <br/>
people in the post office.   I&#39;m sure it slowed the line down for him  <br/>
to have done so.<br/>
<br/>
Letting a child play on something absolutely strong that doesn&#39;t fall  <br/>
over is quite different from playing with something unstable. But in  <br/>
any case, stable or unstable, what belongs to other people belongs to  <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling doesn&#39;t give children special privileges at Wendy&#39;s or  <br/>
the post office.<br/>

If we don&#39;t want people calling our children brats for expressing  <br/>

calling women &quot;bats&quot; for expressing themselves honestly.<br/>

waitress about it and apologized.  I offered to pay for the salt <br/>
shaker.  I talked to DS about NOT licking the salt shakers, but never <br/>
thought about talking to him about not &quot;smelling&quot; the salt shakers!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>And I understand that fully.  I don&#39;t approve of what my child did, <br/>
but in all fairness, he didn&#39;t know it was not appropriate.  And at <br/>
that age, children tend to put their noses directly on things when <br/>
they smell, or at least my ds does.  Had I been sitting with him when <br/>
that happened, I could have stopped him and talked with him about why <br/>
that was not appropriate.  I could have put some in my hand for him <br/>
to smell.  I was foolish for not being there with them at the table. <br/>
BTW, we do not have salt and pepper shakers sitting on our table at <br/>
home.  Good grief, we can&#39;t even GET to our table most of the time <br/>
due to all the stuff on it that we are working on! So I&#39;m sure it was <br/>
a noveltly to him.<br/>

to me instead of scaring him.  Especially when she told him she would <br/>
spank him next time.  That is not her place to say something like <br/>
that and I don&#39;t want my son to feel that some stranger has that <br/>
right.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Unschooling doesn&#39;t give children special privileges at Wendy&#39;s or  <br/>
&gt; the post office.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I also agree with that statement, but I think, being only 5, Ds just <br/>
doesn&#39;t think about the consequences of what he does.  He is <br/>
impulsive.  Smelling the salt and pepper must have seemed like <br/>
something interesting to do at that moment, not something <br/>
destructive.  If he were doing it to be malicious, that would be <br/>
another story.<br/>
<br/>
I am the one to blame in this situation.  It didn&#39;t occur to me that <br/>
Ds would want to smell the salt and pepper while I was ordering our <br/>
food.  <br/>
<br/>
Sandra, I appreciate your directness.  It certainly gives me much to <br/>
think about.  I think sometimes I tend to forget that young children <br/>
just don&#39;t know what is expected of them out in the world, and my job <br/>
is to help them, as you said, be able to function in it.  Thanks for <br/>
your input.  Looking forward to what else you might say!<br/>

Usually, if Shelby (9)  is doing something I think or know others  <br/>
would object to, I&#39;ll ask her to stop and tell her why.  I tell her  <br/>
that I don&#39;t agree with them or think she shouldn&#39;t be doing those  <br/>
things, but that I don&#39;t want a stranger to reprimand her.  She  <br/>
understands that.<br/>
<br/>
I have stood up to people for saying things to her, and unfortunately  <br/>
that will upset Shelby even more sometimes.  Sometimes I tell the  <br/>
workers that if she does indeed damage something I will be happy to  <br/>
pay for it.  My husband has literally gotten in people&#39;s faces telling  <br/>
them to *never* speak to his family that way again.<br/>

&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  You are mad and I&#39;m sitting here crying for that little boy. I can&#39;t say<br/>
&gt;  what I would have done. I guess it depends on my mood at that time. I<br/>
&gt;  think you handled it fine w/ the worker (I have a hard time not getting<br/>
&gt;  upset and raising my voice). I think that extending the experience to<br/>
&gt;  talk to the manager right then would have just made it worse for your<br/>
&gt;  DS. Maybe go back tomorrow and lodge a formal complaint. No one should<br/>
&gt;  feel they have the right to speak that way to your child. A worker at<br/>
&gt;  the post office told my son to stop playing w/ those rope things once. I<br/>
&gt;  flushed and felt upset that he&#39;d taken it upon himself to tell my son to<br/>
&gt;  stop doing something I didn&#39;t feel was destructive or dangerous. I wish<br/>
&gt;  I&#39;d said something to the man, but instead I just felt ashamed and got<br/>
&gt;  upset w/ my own kids. I handled it poorly. I think on the scale of how<br/>
&gt;  things are handled, you did very well. That old lady comes from a<br/>
&gt;  different generation. One I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not a part of. I strive to be<br/>
&gt;  more like you and less like that old bat everyday.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t see why they couldn&#39;t just wash the salt shakers, then. I <br/>
understand the need for sanitation, but that is no excuse for a <br/>
stranger to be so nasty to a small child. if I had been working <br/>
there I would have asked the child politely to stop, and if it <br/>
continued to be a problem I would talk to the parent. and after the <br/>
family left I would make sure to take the saltshaker and clean it. <br/>
by being so confrontational directly to a child, particularly one so <br/>
young (not a teenager) I think she was overstepping the appropriate <br/>
boundary. <br/>
<br/>
I do not allow strangers to parent my children when we are out in <br/>
public. I realize some people, particularly from an older <br/>
generation, think it&#39;s ok to do so, but I find it extremely <br/>
inappropriate. <br/>
<br/>
I had an incident once where a lady at a thrift store was being mean <br/>
to my daughter about touching the fragile stuff. I was using it as <br/>
an opportunity to teach her to touch nicely, but the lady kept <br/>
grabbing things away from her and telling her NO after I had already <br/>
given my daughter permission to touch them. I told her to leave my <br/>
daughter alone and that if she broke anything I would gladly pay for <br/>
it. she ignored me and continued harassing my daughter. I made a <br/>
complaint to the manager. apparently there had been several problems <br/>
with this lady and they asked her to stop volunteering at the thrift <br/>
store after that. I&#39;m glad I spoke up. I have had to tell people on <br/>
occasion, &quot;if you have a problem with what my child is doing, talk <br/>
to ME about it.&quot; obviously that boundary will have to change <br/>
somewhat as my kids get older (currently my oldest is 3), but <br/>
particularly with young kids, I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s appropriate <br/>
for random strangers to do that sort of thing.</div>

It&#39;s a bad idea to model calling other people mean names.  Also it is <br/>
unfair to smear all members of &quot;another generation&quot; as cranky. (I <br/>
believe another older woman caught up with our original poster and <br/>
tried to console her by saying that the Wendy&#39;s worker was a mean old <br/>
lady. So all members of that &quot;other generation&quot; are not created equal.)<br/>

If we&#39;re lucky, all the women on this list will achieve the status of <br/>

<br/>
The problem with that, though, is that you can&#39;t really give your  <br/>
daughter permission to touch things you don&#39;t own.  If you owned a  <br/>
store (or if you can imagine owning a store) you would realize that  <br/>
you wouldn&#39;t want everyone who comes in the door touching everything  <br/>
you have, no matter how old they are.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve recommended thrift stores and antique shops as museums, and  <br/>
we&#39;ve had some GREAT times talking about items in stores, but it  <br/>
doesn&#39;t make them hands-on children&#39;s museums.<br/>
<br/>
The grabbing is bad and the &quot;NO&quot; is bad, but I question the  <br/>
assumption that being able to buy broken things gives the parent  <br/>
privileges that other customers don&#39;t have.<br/>

Perhaps this is one of those times to discuss with the kids how some <br/>

that another person might have been able to communicate what she was <br/>

Two wrongs don&#39;t make a right.<br/>
<br/>
What your kids might likely learn from such hypothetical behavior is  <br/>
that it&#39;s just fine to insult and threaten people in public.<br/>
<br/>
Either it&#39;s fine or it&#39;s not.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Come on people smelling,licking or snotting on a salt shaker does  <br/>
not give a worker in an establishment the right to tell your kid she  <br/>
is going to spank him if he does it again! And a 5 yr old at  <br/>
that,hell no!-=-<br/>
<br/>
Instead of there being two options in such a case, there are probably  <br/>
49,000, give or take 25,000.<br/>
<br/>
If a child is curious about salt shakers, give him one at home and  <br/>
let him smell, lick, snot, or scratch his ass with it.  Let him get  <br/>
it out of his system at home.  Don&#39;t leave children to learn in  <br/>
public what would be easily learned at home.<br/>
<br/>
No human at any age has the moral right to create unsanitary  <br/>
conditions in a restaurant.<br/>
<br/>
The mother has already said she shouldn&#39;t have left the kids alone at  <br/>
the table, that she could have come back when it wasn&#39;t crowded, that  <br/>
lots of things could&#39;ve been different.<br/>
<br/>
What a person has a right to do verbally is a different thing from  <br/>
what a person has a right to do physically, and recommending that  <br/>
parents throw down in public doesn&#39;t seem to be good for the parents  <br/>
or the children either.<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;m closer to a child than his parents are, in LOTS of  <br/>
situations, it sometimes happens that for reasons of safety or  <br/>
propriety I say something to that child.  If a parent wants to make  <br/>
sure I never &quot;have the right&quot; to choose my own words when speaking to  <br/>
another human, they will need to stay between me and their children.<br/>
<br/>
Have I ever told a stranger child that I was going to spank them?   <br/>
Not even nearly.  I have gone up to stranger MOTHERS and told them to  <br/>
stop hitting or threatening their children.  Did I &quot;have the right&quot;  <br/>
to do that?&quot;  If I were taken to court for it, not all judges would  <br/>
agree.<br/>
<br/>
When I told the neighbor kids to get off my back wall, after they  <br/>
threw my jack-o-lantern down, and when they were just about to climb  <br/>
over on an electric gate, I had the right to do that.  Had they  <br/>
gotten hurt, their parents could have sued me.  Had they hurt my gate  <br/>
it would&#39;ve been a waste of time for me to even tell their parents it  <br/>
happened.  I told them to get down.  I pointed out that they  had a  <br/>
wall just like mine and they should climb on that one.<br/>
<br/>
When I pulled over and told a little boy (10ish) to stop bulling the  <br/>
other boy he was walking with, I didn&#39;t wonder for a second what his  <br/>
mother would think about me saying that.  He was pushing the other  <br/>
kid into the road, and there wasn&#39;t much traffic, but what if I  had  <br/>
been looking the other way and hit him?<br/>
<br/>
One of the dangers of sending a child out into the world unprepared  <br/>
to know what&#39;s expected of him, what&#39;s legal, what&#39;s courteous,  <br/>
what&#39;s safe, or the danger of sending a child out into the world with  <br/>
the idea that it&#39;s fine for him to go &quot;the f#*k off on someone&quot; is  <br/>
that he is open to the criticism and disapproval of others, and when  <br/>
he&#39;s old enough, he&#39;s subject to arrest, or worse.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling doesn&#39;t mean telling kids the rules of the world don&#39;t  <br/>
apply to them.  You can give them scads of crazy new freedom at home,  <br/>
but you can&#39;t tell people in public to change their lives and  <br/>
expectations because here comes an unschooled child.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-769720812">Hi, I felt sad to hear that someone was disrespectful and unkind, and<br/>
disappointed as well that there was ageist talk going on and being modeled<br/>
about older women. As a 62 year old, I deserve to be talked to and about in<br/>
a nice way just as a child does. Fortunately I have developed skills over<br/>
the years to deal with stress and in the best of all worlds parents have<br/>
these skills to pass on to their kids. This would have been and still is a<br/>
good opportunity for this mom to model and communicate things to her son<br/>
that will fortify him and that will be more useful and better for everyone<br/>
than dealing with feelings by expressing ill will and prejudice towards a<br/>
particular segment of the population. I have spent my whole life advocating<br/>
for children. My husband and I have grown kids that were never in school and<br/>
who were unschooled. I founded and was director of one of only two<br/>
non-coercive un-schools in the country that was publicly funded. At this<br/>
un-school, young people ages 5 to 19 could spend their time (within the<br/>
constraints of safety) any way they chose. They were not separated by age<br/>
and they pretty much ran the show. Parents, friends and siblings were always<br/>
welcome and it was not a prison. They could come and go at any time with<br/>
their parents consent and they could attend the number of hours that they<br/>
wanted. There was a process in place for kids to fire the staff if they<br/>
chose to. The kids also decided how money was spent and through a democratic<br/>
process where students (for lack of a better word) each had one vote<br/>
regardless of age, made decisions. My goal was to create a village for<br/>
families based on unschooling principles and it went on for 6 years. This<br/>
school closed a year ago when the state changed the way alternatives were<br/>
funded. Since then I have been working as a life coach. One of my<br/>
specialties is working with parents. I am writing this not to toot my own<br/>
horn about myself, but rather to point out that there are many people<br/>
(regardless of age) who are or may become allies and who can be a source of<br/>
support. There are also people of all ages who act badly. In my opinion, a<br/>
culture that steals away the sovereignty of children and that disrespects<br/>
and disempowers elders is in great trouble.<br/>
I have never posted here before, but felt I needed to speak up about this. I<br/>
appreciate that you are all here and that you are trying to do something<br/>
that is extraordinary in our culture. Thanks you for listening.</div>

her, I wanted a peaceful resolution *more.* I looked at him with a smile and<br/>
said, don&#39;t worry about it, I&#39;ll clean it up, it&#39;s my job. She was about to<br/>
insist and I assured her it was fine and would be taken care of and I did.<br/>
They came back recently. I kept a closer eye on the boy this time, thinking<br/>
of ways to occupy him. He found a syrup dispenser. While I watched, he<br/>
looked at his reflection, admired the opening mechanism, watched the syrup&#39;s<br/>
slow swirl as he moved it, truly *enjoyed* this experience -- he caught my<br/>
eye and jumped! I quickly smiled and was about to talk to him when his mama<br/>
noticed and came over *to yell at him* - I stopped her (put up my hand and<br/>
smiled) and told her I was watching and it was just fine, he didn&#39;t put<br/>
anything in his mouth or touch it to his face. I quickly gave him coffee<br/>
filters and highlighters, found bread ties and I had kids (we&#39;d caught the<br/>
attention of a couple of more by then) making butterflies at the counter. He<br/>
was SO happy to have this craft (tho he tried in vain to get his mama to<br/>
admire it) and fly it around; he couldn&#39;t wait to show his friends. Less<br/>
than 10 cents and 10 minutes.<br/>
I&#39;d not expect this kind of service everywhere I went with kids, I sure do<br/>
appreciate it when I find it. And I&#39;m glad to provide it. The world has<br/>
plenty of crabby folk, what we need most (and our kids *for sure*) is more<br/>
models of gentle and forgiving ways of being.<br/>
Plus, it&#39;s not that tough to have simple things like that in your purse to<br/>
pull out for the kids to do at the table while they&#39;re waiting for you. I<br/>
still carry stuff for Hayden, 9.5, when we&#39;re out and about (yesterday it<br/>
was hemp, sharpies, paper, and peg games for a trip to the beach and I<br/>
pulled out a surprise finger kite, though we had no wind!) ready for his<br/>
need for something to do at a moments notice &/or to fill those gaps in<br/>
activities.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1971031072">Hi, I felt sad to hear that someone was disrespectful and unkind, and<br/>
disappointed as well that there was ageist talk going on and being modeled<br/>
about older women. As a 62 year old, I deserve to be talked to and about in<br/>
a nice way just as a child does. Fortunately I have developed skills over<br/>
the years to deal with stress and in the best of all worlds parents have<br/>
these skills to pass on to their kids. This would have been and still is a<br/>
good opportunity for this mom to model and communicate things to her son<br/>
that will fortify him and that will be more useful and better for everyone<br/>
than dealing with feelings by expressing ill will and prejudice towards a<br/>
particular segment of the population. I have spent my whole life advocating<br/>
for children. My husband and I have grown kids that were never in school and<br/>
who were unschooled. I founded and was director of one of only two<br/>
non-coercive un-schools in the country that was publicly funded. At this<br/>
un-school, young people ages 5 to 19 could spend their time (within the<br/>
constraints of safety) any way they chose. They were not separated by age<br/>
and they pretty much ran the show. Parents, friends and siblings were always<br/>
welcome and it was not a prison. They could come and go at any time with<br/>
their parents consent and they could attend the number of hours that they<br/>
wanted. There was a process in place for kids to fire the staff if they<br/>
chose to. The kids also decided how money was spent and through a democratic<br/>
process where students (for lack of a better word) each had one vote<br/>
regardless of age, made decisions. My goal was to create a village for<br/>
families based on unschooling principles and it went on for 6 years. This<br/>
school closed a year ago when the state changed the way alternatives were<br/>
funded. Since then I have been working as a life coach. One of my<br/>
specialties is working with parents. I am writing this not to toot my own<br/>
horn about myself, but rather to point out that there are many people<br/>
(regardless of age) who are or may become allies and who can be a source of<br/>
support. There are also people of all ages who act badly. In my opinion, a<br/>
culture that steals away the sovereignty of children and that disrespects<br/>
and disempowers elders is in great trouble.<br/>
I have never posted here before, but felt I needed to speak up about this. I<br/>
appreciate that you are all here and that you are trying to do something<br/>
that is extraordinary in our culture. Thanks you for listening.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2103333344">About two weeks ago we were shopping at Marshalls. The guard at the  <br/>
fitting rooms was a woman who was obviously sort of miserable - she  <br/>
was just short of being overly rude to me when I went in. Roxana and  <br/>
Rosie came in a few minutes later, I was inside and could hear, but  <br/>
the woman didn&#39;t know they were with me. She was EXTREMELY rude,  <br/>
barked at them because something wasn&#39;t on a hanger (the store is a  <br/>
mess, lots of stuff off hangers, draped over the tops of racks, etc),  <br/>
told them they were NOT allowed to share a dressing room, harshly told  <br/>
them to bring the clothes out and let her count them again when they  <br/>
were done. It was very hostile, and I knew my girls were probably  <br/>
really embarrassed to be treated that way - there were lots of people  <br/>

<br/>
So, I stuck my head out and said, &quot;I&#39;m here.&quot; I could see they were  <br/>

They didn&#39;t even want to try on the clothes - so I got dressed, we  <br/>

they complained quietly to me and I said, &quot;I&#39;d feel better if I said  <br/>
something to the store manager.&quot; They hesitated, because they didn&#39;t  <br/>
want me making a scene, but I said, &quot;I won&#39;t make a scene, but I just  <br/>
want to say something.&quot;<br/>

So I did. I said, &quot;I just wanted to say that I have two very sweet,  <br/>
honest girls here, and the woman in the dressing room was very rude to  <br/>

He apologized directly to them and said he&#39;d speak to her about it. I  <br/>

Holly always keeps a very well-supplied purse.  She has tweezers,  <br/>
bandaids, antibiotic, scissors...<br/>
<br/>
Today she came and asked where decks of cards were.  I showed her my  <br/>
personal stash, some going back to when I was in college.  She found  <br/>
a deck she liked and said she wants to keep cards in her purse.<br/>
<br/>
She doesn&#39;t even have kids, but she was at the department of motor  <br/>
vehicles yesterday.  I&#39;m guessing that was her inspiration.<br/>
<br/>
She always has a notebook and colored pens, too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1720909951">And yet an adult in a store can pick something up to turn it over and <br/>
examine it, especially if they are contemplating buying it.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn liked to pick things up in stores like the little figurines in Longs <br/>
drug store. I always hovered very close. She was so delicate and careful <br/>
even as a two year old. Great fine motor skills! We were lucky. The couple <br/>
of times I noticed nervous associates, they also noticed me standing close <br/>
and her care, and nothing nasty or even cautionary was ever said. Of course, <br/>
this was mass market stuff, not something antique or unique.<br/>
<br/>
The only time anyone has broken something in a store was me (and I put it <br/>
down to a design flaw in the object). I carried the thing to the cashier and <br/>
offered to pay and got told not to worry about it - thank you kind folk at <br/>
the Disney Store.<br/>
<br/>
I think the waitress handled it unnecessarily harshly, and crossed the line <br/>
by threatening to spank or indeed say anything further to the child, once <br/>
the mom was there and able to communicate. Having worked in restaurants at <br/>
different times, including a graveyard shift when all the big cleaning gets <br/>
done, I can tell you that even salt and pepper shakers do get washed if they <br/>
aren&#39;t absolutely disposable. My feeling was that the waitress was being <br/>
disingenuous about the whole &quot;have to throw it away&quot; guilt trip.<br/>
<br/>
However we can&#39;t expect everyone we meet in life to be as kind and pleasant <br/>
and respectful as unschoolers!<br/>
<br/>
I thought Melissa spoke wonderfully to the waitress. I wish I had her poise. <br/>
I tend to just leave places.<br/>
