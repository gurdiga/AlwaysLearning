It&#39;s a good article on unschooling that was in the Calgary Herald,  <br/>
August 29 2010.<br/>
The unschooling parts are really great.  The quotes from  <br/>
&quot;experts&quot; (always included in articles to allegedly &#39;balance&#39; them)  <br/>
had a couple that made me hoot:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In the real world, sometimes you have to complete a task you don&#39;t  <br/>
love.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I would love to have been there when those words were uttered to say  <br/>
&quot;Could you name one?&quot;   Years of practice on this list and reading  <br/>
Joyce&#39;s really great analogies have me all ready to show ANYone that  <br/>
they&#39;re making choices, not living in &quot;have to&quot; world.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This one is baffling.  It has no quotes, so maybe the fumble was in  <br/>
the paraphrasing by the writer, but this is a VERY odd thing for  <br/>
someone to have thought, said or reported on:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Overcoming adversity or mastering challenging, unliked concepts  <br/>
builds self-confidence and self-esteem, says Bell. She also wonders if  <br/>
unschooled kids would learn bits and pieces of knowledge, but perhaps  <br/>
never integrate the strands of education into a cohesive whole. As a  <br/>
former teacher and school principal, she argues children often need an  <br/>
educated educator to help link everything together so they are  <br/>
prepared to go out into the world.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
An &quot;educated educator&quot;??!!  I suppose it&#39;s education that makes one an  <br/>
educated educator.<br/>
<br/>
But aside from that, it wasn&#39;t until I took a humanities class when I  <br/>
was 15 that ANYONE in school suggested to me that art and history and  <br/>
music and science were indistinguishable in the real world.  And I was  <br/>
a curious kid who learned for fun.  But I still thought somehow that  <br/>
each thing might be the intersection between two things, but to  <br/>
intersect with ALL things!?   Fifteen.   And I bet even of the kids in  <br/>
that class with me (a very small subset of kids at our school) most of  <br/>
them didn&#39;t take that &#39;news&#39; from that course.<br/>
<br/>
If I put this on a webpage, I&#39;m going to call it How Learning Works (a  <br/>
rant by Sandra Dodd, inspired by an educated educator)<br/>
The way learning works with unschooling is that each thing a child  <br/>
learns--each bit or piece of knowledge--becomes a part of his cohesive  <br/>
whole.  He doesn&#39;t have &quot;strands of education.&quot;  He has learning.   <br/>
Real, honest, whole, personal learning.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1647421729">&quot;In the real world, sometimes you have to complete a task you don&#39;t <br/>
love.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one of my favorite pro-school arguments of all times!  It implies that <br/>
all kids in school do tasks they don&#39;t love.  I&#39;d even go so far as to say, MOST <br/>
of what kids do in school, kids don&#39;t love.  That certainly doesn&#39;t cause me to <br/>
want my kids in school, daily doing things they don&#39;t love.<br/>
<br/>
I LOVE that my kids can do things they love everyday.  Doing things you love <br/>
helps a person find happy contentedness in one&#39;s life!  It&#39;s a gift I&#39;m giving <br/>
my children!  There are plenty of things they do that they dislike for the sake <br/>
of something greater.  THAT is intrinsic motivation and if the draw of the <br/>
something &quot;greater&quot; isn&#39;t good enough, they choose not to do it and opt for <br/>
other things.<br/>
<br/>
How is that NOT what people do for real, in real life?  People who go ahead and <br/>
do what they please in life often suffer guilt and shame complexes from feeling <br/>
as if they aren&#39;t measuring up.  I&#39;m so glad my kids don&#39;t suffer from that, <br/>
they just don&#39;t.  They do what they do and act the best they can, not to avoid <br/>
some yucky task they don&#39;t love.<br/>
<br/>
Such nonsense!  As if kids in school don&#39;t try to avoid those tasks in so many <br/>
creative ways!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1330656211">Sandra this is hilarious and completely untrue of course!  I am still<br/>
howling, except for the sad fact that this is widely believed. I am glad you<br/>
put this quote in a post...<br/>
&lt;&lt;&quot;Overcoming adversity or mastering challenging, unliked concepts<br/>
builds self-confidence and self-esteem, says Bell. She also wonders if<br/>

<br/>
My kids challenge themselves all the time to master games, or to climb<br/>
higher.  That is how they learn what they find interesting--persistence and<br/>
investigation. How silly that adversity or challenge must be foisted on<br/>
children in the form of &quot;unliked&quot; concepts.  My kids don&#39;t change subjects<br/>
every 30 minutes, so they get to see how things are connected.<br/>
<br/>
 I remember when Rowan was in school a teacher explained that he couldn&#39;t<br/>
consider Rowan&#39;s science paper as a source of his English mark.  English<br/>
marks came from writing English papers.  My smart ass comment included, the<br/>
question &quot;was Rowan&#39;s science paper written in Latin&quot;?  Why couldn&#39;t it be<br/>
used to judge his ability to formulate sentences and discuss ideas?<br/>
<br/>
 I guess that there educated educator must of known something I didn&#39;t:-)<br/>

Well one thing they know is that they are not paid to have ANYthing to  <br/>
do with subjects in which they are not certified to teach.  And  <br/>
probably they could get in trouble with the union for touching extra  <br/>
work.<br/>
<br/>
And wouldn&#39;t it seem like... you know,... *cheating* for one set of  <br/>
writing to &quot;count&quot; twice?    If they let one kid do it, wouldn&#39;t they  <br/>
&quot;have to&quot; let everybody do it?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.  High level thinking by educated educationalist educators in  <br/>
educational institutions.<br/>

Our discussion didn&#39;t get that far.  He was just too perplexed by the idea<br/>
that science papers were in English.  I mean Rowan was studying French at<br/>
the time and this teacher  considered Math, English, French and Science<br/>
separate subjects.<br/>
<br/>
 He couldn&#39;t connect the fact that except writing done in French, he had<br/>
loads of English writing with which he could assess Rowan&#39;s ability to write<br/>
in English if that were truly the problem.  The problem was Rowan wasn&#39;t<br/>
doing enough English assignments, but the teacher would never have put it<br/>
this way because he knew  I would have asked why English needed to be taught<br/>
as its own subject, and by this point in the year he knew I would have loads<br/>
of scholarly articles to show that this didn&#39;t need to be the case and that<br/>
would have meant me writing letters to superintendents and him having to<br/>
speak to his union, again.<br/>
<br/>
Funny you should mention unions Sandra :-)<br/>
His union had already advised him never to be alone with me, because my<br/>
husband wrote a letter to a school superintendent complaining about this<br/>
teacher&#39;s behaviour.  As you can imagine Rowan left to homeschool shortly<br/>
after this conversation. In many cases the school would have fought to keep<br/>
the pupil, but Rowan came with this really annoying mother and they were<br/>
willing to cut their funding losses.<br/>

students that if they can write one paper that works for two different <br/>
classes that I&#39;m thrilled because it means they are seeing the <br/>
connections and that they should try to choose a topic that will let <br/>
them do that. But - they do have to ask the other professor, too, and <br/>

If to live in the real world meant just that then we would have to put up<br/>
with so many things we do not love and turn into lunatics and neurotics. No<br/>
wonder the world is gone all crazy.<br/>
<br/>
It is like telling people stay in a relationship even if you do not LOVE<br/>
that person. Stay in a job even if you do not LOVE doing it. Stay in a house<br/>
even it has leaking roofs and termites crawling all over your furniture.<br/>

The world things like this because most people are governed by false notions<br/>
of security, which they feel comes from external factors. False notions of<br/>
financial security, marital security, relationship security, security for<br/>
the future and stuff.<br/>

The day people start living in the here and now, this belief that &quot;One must<br/>

<br/>
Last night Linnaea did the dishes. It was the first time she&#39;s done them since <br/>
she was little. She was very conscientious about doing them, making sure each <br/>
dish and each piece of cutlery were absolutely clean. She asked if she could do <br/>
the dishes and I said yes and I dried as she washed and changed the water when <br/>
she thought it was too grey to actually clean anymore dishes. She didn&#39;t have to <br/>
complete it. She&#39;s not awake right now, but I bet you she&#39;d say she enjoyed <br/>
doing the dishes.  It was fun to watch her play with the bubbles as the sink <br/>
refilled. It was fun to be with her, on her roller skates, with her very damp <br/>
shirt from where the water overflowed a bit, having a good time in the warm and <br/>
bright kitchen. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
By 10 it was rare for me to enjoy doing the dishes. But I often enjoy doing them <br/>
now. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-655911792">I just read something about cheating that 73 percent of 20 000 first year<br/>
Canadian post-secondary students admitted they cheated in high school, and<br/>
53 per cent admitted to plagiarism.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/family-and-relationships/cheaters-do-prosper-but-are-they-psychologically-ill/article1704646/">http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/family-and-relationships/cheaters-do-prosper-but-are-they-psychologically-ill/article1704646/</a><br/>
<br/>
The fact that cheating is handing in the same paper for two different<br/>
courses at one place is a little funny.<br/>
<br/>
I wrote papers for others through high school.  My friends thought it was<br/>
funny that papers I wrote for others generally received higher grades than<br/>
ones I wrote for myself.  I noted this oddity and it is something that<br/>
informs my unschooling family&#39;s practices, I admit.<br/>
<br/>
A paper I wrote for a final year  English class in high school received five<br/>
marks lower than one I wrote for the girl in front of me.  When I went to<br/>
the teacher to complain, which I&#39;d never done before it was precisely<br/>
because I *knew* my paper was better.  I had hand written hers, because it<br/>
began as me proofreading what she had already written.  After I&#39;d liquid<br/>
papered in corrections and re-written what she had, I offered suggestions<br/>
for the unfinished third.  She asked me if I could just write it.  It was on<br/>
a different topic than mine.  I had an hour before class and so I completed<br/>
her paper, then fixed her footnotes and bibliography for her.  I used a<br/>
different pen, and the handwriting didn&#39;t match of course in the corrected<br/>
sections and final third ;-)  I asked her for her pen, but she didn&#39;t have<br/>
the one she&#39;d had the previous evening.  My paper was done on computer and<br/>
neatly printed and in a pretty file folder, while hers was hastily<br/>
stapled.   We wrote  essay exams and my essay exams received the highest<br/>
mark in the class, in all my history and English classes.  Yet, this teacher<br/>
was oblivious to this when she issued marks.  It never occurred to her that<br/>
the other girl hadn&#39;t written her own paper. We went through my paper line<br/>
by line and in the end she raised my grade because she couldn&#39;t explain my<br/>
grade and I had a lot of fun reviewing with her what I though was good.  I<br/>
mean I had enjoyed my word choices, my examples and the flow of the language<br/>
as I wrote, so I really was happy to share that with her.  For her part the<br/>
teacher was bored with my explaining how much I felt the subjunctive worked<br/>
to give the paper a gender free approach and was less awkward than using &quot;he<br/>
or she&quot; and I didn&#39;t need to break a grammatical rule by choosing &quot;she&quot; as<br/>
my universal pronoun.<br/>
<br/>
I remember one girl asking me for my study secrets, as she was a straight A<br/>
student and the essay exams dragged her mark down.  I told her not to<br/>
memorize information or cram, but just write about the material she knew and<br/>
understand.  I still remember the baffled look on her face.  I never studied<br/>
for tests--I just wrote what I knew.<br/>
<br/>
I did have a teacher accuse me of plagiarism once.  I dared him to give me<br/>
fifteen minutes to write two paragraphs on any topic he choose.  After this<br/>
I convinced him by bringing in my sources, showing him all my footnotes, and<br/>
going though the paper with a fine tooth comb with him though he raised my<br/>
grade.  At this point I told him I would get one of my other teachers to<br/>
vouch for me as a good writer and he told me this was not necessary. He did<br/>
not give my paper an  A or A plus.  He raised my grade from an F to  a B<br/>
plus, though he had just accused me of plagiarism because the writing I had<br/>
handed in was* too good to have written by a grade ten student*.  Ahhh,<br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
In University I spent my first year writing papers for money.  It was<br/>
accidental, as I started offering to type and proofread papers for cash.<br/>
Then I received a paper that was one long sentence, with no punctuation and<br/>
no footnotes.  I helped write most of the paper, while he hung by nodding<br/>
and saying &quot;yes, that sounds good&quot;.  The paper written for a psych class, of<br/>
which I knew nothing, received an A.  Soon others were knocking on my door,<br/>
cash in hand.  I wrote, while in first year many second year and third year<br/>
papers, and even an essay for a student in law school.  The law paper only<br/>
received a B,  so she wasn&#39;t a return customer.  I gave up the essay<br/>
business though I continued to help proofread essays for friends, and<br/>
occasionally &quot;edited&quot;  papers or &quot;punched them up a bit&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 I even wrote a paper, while drunk, for someone who later became a primary<br/>
school teacher.  The only person I ever told that to is my husband, and it<br/>
reinforced his commitment to unschooling. I confess I also remember that<br/>
whenever I am in a confrontation with a teacher, that some members of that<br/>
profession may have gotten there through academic *dishonesty*<br/>
<br/>
I remember as I sat at her typewriter with her books and photocopies<br/>
speedily typing she marvelled at how I could just look at the information<br/>
and come up with an essay.  I remarked it wasn&#39;t as much fun as starting<br/>
with a thesis and then trying to prove it, but it made for a stronger<br/>
rapidly produced essay to begin at the &quot;proof&quot; first and develop points<br/>
around what could be gleaned from that information.  She thought it was<br/>
weird that I wrote papers for fun rather than grades.<br/>

Well, I never thought about it from that perspective-- that she was judging<br/>
me on the fact that writing came more easily to me, lol I was just really<br/>
annoyed that the paper I worked on for the other girl was on an easier<br/>
topic, that I&#39;d done it and she was probably going to get into a better<br/>
