<div id="ygrps-yiv-162308253">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I just found you a few days ago, and thought I&#39;d introduce myself.  <br/>
I&#39;m Heather, married SAHM, with 2 children.  DS Chase is 3 1/2, <br/>
Kylee is 13 mos today.  My husband and I decided to homeschool 2 <br/>
years ago, but are still working on our philosophy and method plan.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m interested in unschooling, but don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll have the <br/>
courage to stick with it.  Love takes courage and patience and joy <br/>
and fortitude.  What&#39;s the connection?  It occured to me that all <br/>
parents, especially  those who take the time to homeschool love <br/>
their children.  They want what&#39;s best, at least in their own <br/>
minds.  People who unschool are IN LOVE with their children.  <br/>
They&#39;ve never lost the awe a parent has when gazing at a newborn and <br/>
marveling at the combination of potential and innate wisdom that <br/>
tiny being posesses.  Unschooling parents are like members of a <br/>
couple who are falling in love, they want to know everything about <br/>
the other person, want to have adventures and grow together, and <br/>
can&#39;t imagine living parallel but disconnected lives.  I realize <br/>
there are challenges, and days when either parent or child is grumpy <br/>
or tough to be around, but the basic idea that we&#39;re in this life to <br/>
learn together and grow together stands over the years.<br/>
<br/>
What do you think?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!  Also, please share any sites or resources you recommend for <br/>
newbies.  I&#39;ve read Holt&#39;s &quot;Learning all the Time&quot; but am looking <br/>
for more info.<br/>

I have a collection of things about &quot;being in love&quot; and it shouldn&#39;t  <br/>
apply to one&#39;s children.  Seriously. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I don&#39;t think loving children is particular to unschoolers, though I  <br/>
think it&#39;s easier to love children who are near and familiar and not  <br/>
furious with the parents.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know that you need courage to &quot;stick with it&quot; so much as to <br/>
get started. Its scary stepping away from the standard family <br/>
paradigm. Its unnerving to Trust when all your background is <br/>
screaming &quot;just say NO!&quot; even when you can see the way to &quot;Yes.&quot; Its <br/>
frustrating to have to rethink and reframe and reexamine all the <br/>
time until it starts to feel natural. <br/>
<br/>
Once it does start to feel natural &quot;sticking with&quot; unschooling isn&#39;t <br/>
like being in love at all. Its like living with someone who is <br/>
important to you. Standard parenting expects children to become less <br/>
important to parents and vice versa. If you have a 3yr old you&#39;ve <br/>
been getting some of those messages already - messages <br/>
about &quot;separation&quot; and all the &quot;personal time&quot; you&#39;ll &quot;get back&quot; <br/>
once your kid goes to preschool.<br/>
<br/>
From that perspective, spending so much time together seems weird - <br/>
like a twenty year love affair. To &#39;get&#39; unschooling takes an <br/>
entirely *different* perspective about people living together as <br/>
families. Its a perspective that you only get *after* you&#39;ve started <br/>
unschooling - which is why starting can be sooooo scary. <br/>
<br/>
One of the things I found most helpful when I was just getting into <br/>
unschooling was to hear the stories of people with kids just a <br/>
little older than mine. It was exciting to read about teens, but <br/>
still really abstract b/c I wasn&#39;t living with a teen, I was living <br/>
with a 3yr old. Hearing the stories of people with 5 yr olds gave me <br/>
the &quot;courage&quot; to get over all the &quot;what ifs&quot; and &quot;yes, buts&quot; that <br/>
come up in the beginning. <br/>
