ON HOW TO LISTEN TO THE RADIO<br/>
 From The Art of Listening by Filson Young, printed in the 1928 BBC  <br/>
Handbook:<br/>
<br/>
Intemperate Listening<br/>
<br/>
No one, however leisured his or her life, ought to listen all the  <br/>
time. There would be something excessive and intemperate about such a  <br/>
person. Yet like so many other things, listening to wireless  <br/>
transmissions may become a habit, and a bad habit. Fear that one may  <br/>
be missing something by not listening is one cause; but a more  <br/>
insidious one is the feeling that something is going on somewhere,  <br/>
and that rather than take the trouble to do anything else for  <br/>
oneself, one might as well listen to it. That, of course, is as great  <br/>
an injustice to the art of Broadcasting as it is to the listener  <br/>
himself. It is a misuse of what, properly used, can be a very real  <br/>
boon to the aesthetic life of any household. I would urge listeners  <br/>
to cultivate the art of using their wireless receivers intelligently  <br/>
and artistically, so that the immense care and trouble that are taken  <br/>
in compiling and presenting the programmes shall achieve their true  <br/>
direction and effect.<br/>
