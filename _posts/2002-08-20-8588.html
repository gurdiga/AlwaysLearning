<div id="ygrps-yiv-1800188219">I went to the HSC Conference this weekend and had a great <br/>
time!  <br/>
I got to meet Sandra, Holly, Pam S, Pam H, Jocelyn, Dan, Betsy, <br/>
and Laura.  It was so nice to see people in the flesh!  I also had <br/>
the pleasure of hearing Sandra and Pam S. speak at the <br/>
conference.<br/>
I&#39;ll definitely be doing the conference thing again next year!<br/>
<br/>
Well I&#39;m off to England for almost 2 weeks, so I&#39;ll catch up with <br/>
you all when I&#39;m back.<br/>
<br/>
Meghan :-)</div>
