<div id="ygrps-yiv-156383095">I love words - and I love learning new ones. My dictionary has no place in<br/>
my home - by which I mean, it sits on the table / floor / shelf / most<br/>
handy place to where I was last reading / using the computer / listening to<br/>
the radio so that I can immediately check out words I don&#39;t know, or words<br/>
used in a way that I haven&#39;t heard before. Similarly, I only have to type a<br/>
&#39;d&#39; into the url box on my computer and dictionary.com pops up immediately<br/>
:) So on reading &#39;canalize&#39; I immediately looked it up:<br/>
can·al·ize [kan-l-ahyz, kuh-nal-ahyz] Show IPA<br/>
verb (used with object), can·al·ized, can·al·iz·ing.<br/>
1.<br/>
to make a canal &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/canal">http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/canal</a>&gt;  or<br/>
canals&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/canal">http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/canal</a>&gt;<br/>
 through.<br/>
2.<br/>
to convert into a canal &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/canal">http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/canal</a>&gt;.<br/>
3.<br/>
to divide (a stream) into reaches with locks or dams, usually to maintain<br/>
navigable depths.<br/>
4.<br/>
to divert into certain channels; give a certain direction to or provide a<br/>
certain outlet for.<br/>
<br/>
Lo and behold - #4 came up with the goods :) Another word learned.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I do love words :)<br/>

 less than kind. Whenever I ask about how they are doing, her immediate 
response is &quot;oh, you mean those monsters? they are driving me nuts, as 
usual&quot; . She works full time outside of the home and her twins are in 
daycare. We used to talk in the evening sometimes as well as on the 
weekends, but for awhile now I am reluctant to call&nbsp; at all because the 
conversation is predictable in terms of the words she will use to 
describe her children
 and her life (&quot;just trying to get stuff done with these two running 
around causing trouble&quot; etc.) while my stories are full of positive 
words about our kids and things they have been engaged in. I&nbsp; thought 
maybe she is cranky that she has to go to work, but she has stated that 
she chooses not to be home with them. My question is this: how would you
 respond to a family member that speaks this way about their children? 
My method so far has been to change the subject.&nbsp; There have been times 
when she says &quot;they are in this awful phase of screaming over 
everything- I guess this is the terrible threes that people talk 
about.This is so much harder than I imagined&quot;.</div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">
 We have always had a close relationship and I&#39;m wondering if anyone 
would suggest just flat out
 asking her &quot;why do you talk about your kids like that?&quot;.&nbsp; It seems as 
if this negative wording and thinking has become a way of life for her 
and it is such a downer to listen to it anymore and yet I want to keep 
our close relationship.&nbsp; Thoughts????<br></div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></div>Kristen<div><br></div></div></html></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-742349759">It might be helpful for her to hear your  own &#39;discovery&#39; that even just changing the words you use about something changes how you feel and your behavior too.  A story from you if you have one about how you used to speak without thinking in a similar way- but you are now so much happier and so are your kids since you started making the effort to be more positive?<br/>

 his desktop ( he said they were all taken). So he turns and aks &quot;Mom can you check what is plugged in to the USB ports?&quot;<br>Oh my gosh my sister was rude to him. So I said :<br>&quot;Patrick let me talk to your mom?&quot;<br>She came to the phone and I ask what was up. She started going on about how she just got up and yadda yadda, There was really no reason. She was just impatient and did not want to bother. <br>I called her on it. I&nbsp; gently told her that was no way to talk to her son that was nicely asking a question and that she could tell him nicely that she could not look at that moment if that was the issue but to talk to him like that was uncalled for. <br>I told her she would not like anyone talking to her that way.<br><br>She mellowed out . I went back to talk to Patrick, found him an USB splitter online for less than $10 and he felt heard and valued. <br>She got it for him she told me today. <br><br>Alex Polikowsky<br></div> </div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When Ethan was first born I was amazed at how fast he grew.  Occasionally, my mother-in-law would call and see how things were going, and I would say &quot;He&#39;s growing like a bad weed.&quot;  I cringe now writing that, but it&#39;s the language I grew up with.  I thought it was wonderful that he was growing so strongly, but my word choice really irritated her.  I wasn&#39;t aware of how negative my description sounded until one day she told me that she really didn&#39;t like that I compared her grandson to a bad weed.<br/>
<br/>
At first I was defensive, but as I thought about it and looked at my beautiful baby, I realized she was right.  That was the beginning of me hearing so many of the negative descriptions and automatic phrases I was using.  It was very humbling, but deeply enlightening also.  <br/>
<br/>
My mother-in-law didn&#39;t speak to me unkindly.  She simply told me how she felt about the words I was choosing.  Maybe you could say to your sister something like &quot;It really bothers me when you call my nieces little monsters.&quot;  Let her think about that for a bit.  Maybe, like myself, she doesn&#39;t even really hear what she is saying.  <br/>

thing without thinking about the way it sounds to others, and over time, she 
might do it less.&nbsp; She might get defensive, but it’s kinder of you to give 
her information she might not have thought about yet than to withhold it.
