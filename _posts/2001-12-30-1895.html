<div id="ygrps-yiv-1506827246">Last night after reading here, I was singing &quot;Nothing but the Blood of Jesus&quot; <br/>
to myself, and Holly asked what I was singing, and I sang some aloud.  She <br/>
said to stop singing about Jesus, and I taught her the &quot;soap, soap, soap, <br/>
soap&quot; baseline, and told her that joke.  She couldn&#39;t possibly begin to <br/>
appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>
This morning I was singing Onward Christian Soldiers while I was making <br/>
pancakes, and she said something, and I said &quot;Don&#39;t tell me to stop singing <br/>
about Jesus.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
She said &quot;What if there isn&#39;t really any Jesus?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I said, &quot;Then I&#39;ll be singing about something imaginary.  You sing about <br/>
Totoro.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She thought for a few seconds and said, &quot;Okay.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-325589361">Sadly, I don&#39;t know these songs and I feel badly about that because it<br/>
sounds like a great way to drive my husband nuts.<br/>
The only religious song I know was one I heard on &quot;The Beverly<br/>
Hillbillies&quot;.<br/>
Granny used to sing,  &quot;I&#39;ve got that joy, joy, joy, joy down in my<br/>
heart...&quot;<br/>
I can still hear that little Granny voice.<br/>
They sang that song at a friends funeral several years ago and I thought<br/>
I&#39;d never stop laughing.... I&#39;ve got that joy, joy, joy, joy..<br/>

&lt;&lt; &quot;I&#39;ve got that joy, joy, joy, joy down in my<br/>
heart...&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A couple of weeks ago I sang a version of Row, row, row your boat for Holly <br/>
and her friend Tam.  It is, in a way, translating a simple Saxon song into <br/>
Latinate/Norman French.  That&#39;s still really funny in English after hundreds <br/>
of years.  )I&#39;ll get back to the other song, honest.)<br/>
<br/>
Row, row, row your boat<br/>
Gently down the stream<br/>
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily<br/>
Life is but a dream.<br/>
<br/>
and to the same tune:<br/>
<br/>
Propel, propel, propel your craft<br/>
Placidly down the solution;<br/>
Ecstatic, ecstatic, ecstatic, ecstatic,<br/>
Existence is but an illusion.<br/>
<br/>
And so, in little Baptist kid days, we would put a second verse to<br/>
I&#39;ve got the joy, joy, joy, joy<br/>
Down in my heart<br/>
Down in my heart<br/>
Down in my heart<br/>
I&#39;ve got the joy, joy, joy, joy <br/>
Down in my heart<br/>
Down in my heart to stay.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve got the wonderful love of my Blessed Redeemer<br/>
Way down in the depths of my heart<br/>
Down in the depths of my heart<br/>
Down in the depths of my heart<br/>
I&#39;ve got the wonderful love of my Blessed Redeemer<br/>
Way down in the depths of my heart<br/>
Down in the depths of my heart to stay.<br/>
<br/>
But there are other &quot;real&quot; verses.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve got the peace that passeth understanding<br/>
Down in my heart....<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a kind of camp-song, kids&#39; song for Baptists and that ilk.  <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a weirder one, a different song, with stand-up, full body motions:<br/>
<br/>
SO high you can&#39;t get over it<br/>
SO low you can&#39;t get under it<br/>
SO wide you can&#39;t get around it<br/>
You must go through that door.<br/>
<br/>
The door is salvation, and &quot;It&quot; must be the entirity of existence, including <br/>
temptations and toils and trials and tribulations all those t-words.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-489124856">I know and recognize these verses, Sandra! Especially the &quot;peace that passeth...&quot; part. My mom loves playing church songs on the piano. She must know hundreds of these songs, and she uses the whole piano to play with high and low chord accompaniement and adds her own flourishes to the music (don&#39;t know if that&#39;s what it&#39;s really called).<br/>
<br/>
I can just hear here playing this very song and even singing the words. I remember singing this song in church when I was little and even doing the sit down, stand up thing. We didn&#39;t go to a Baptist church, though. These songs must extend to different religions. We went to a Pentacostal church for a while and they sang songs like these. I&#39;m not sure what other church&#39;s we went to back then, but most involved this kind of singing.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reminding me of my mom today, and Happy New Year to all of you from me!<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know either, but it&#39;s a traditional by-ear hymn accompaniment style.  <br/>
My mom could do it a bit.  My friend Dave McPherson, who&#39;s in his 60&#39;s and <br/>
whose dad was a preacher in Texas can do it really well.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Pentacostal, Nazarene, Church of Christ (without the piano), probably.<br/>
Some Methodists.  <br/>

We used to sing this, too, in Lutheran church. This was my favorite verse. <br/>
It always felt kind like a tongue twister.<br/>

There is no door. ;-)<br/>

Yup. We did this one too. Although for the life of me (and for some fundies, <br/>
I&#39;m sure it is costing the eternal life of me) I can&#39;t remember the rest of <br/>
it.<br/>
