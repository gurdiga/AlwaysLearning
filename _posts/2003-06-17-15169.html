Do YOU believe it can be proved?<br/>

Generally, when there&#39;s a word for something, it&#39;s because something needed a <br/>

He Lives<br/>
<br/>
words: Alfred H. Ackley<br/>

Background music: Joyful Noise Music<br/>
<br/>
I serve a risen Savior, He&#39;s in the world today;<br/>
I know that He is living, whatever men may say;<br/>
I see His hand of mercy, I hear His voice of cheer,<br/>
And just the time I need Him, He&#39;s always near.<br/>
<br/>
CHORUS<br/>
He lives, He lives, Christ Jesus lives today!<br/>
He walks with me and talks with me along life&#39;s narrow way.<br/>
He lives, He lives, salvation to impart!<br/>
You ask me how I know He lives? He lives within my heart.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
In all the world around me I see His loving care,<br/>
And though my heart grows weary, I never will despair;<br/>
I know that He is leading thru all the stormy blast,<br/>
The day of His appearing will come at last.<br/>
<br/>
Rejoice, rejoice, O Christian, lift up your voice and sing<br/>
Eternal hallelujahs to Jesus Christ the King!<br/>
The Hope of all who seek Him, the Help of all who find, <br/>
None other is so loving so good and kind.<br/>
<br/>
I used to LOVE that song, and two hundred more like it.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-475063716">Thanks for the link.  My question isn&#39;t whether or not God exists.  I&#39;m curious about the meaning of the word agnostic.  Guess I need to do a bit more research!<br/>
<br/>
I always thought that agnostics were sort of on the fence.  Don&#39;t believe in god, but don&#39;t believe that there positively ISN&#39;T a god either.  But, when I read the dictionary definition, it made me think that a person could BELIEVE in god, but could still be agnostic.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hello Mary Ellen,<br/>
<br/>
I have a zillion posts to read, but I saw your subject title I had to jump at <br/>
the chance to answer. If someone already has, I apologize in advance.<br/>
<br/>
Gnostics - are those in search of spiritual truth via knowledge<br/>
The word Gnostic stems from the word Gnosis which is Greek in orgin, but <br/>
means Knowledge.<br/>
Gnosticism was/is a movement calling into question the truth of creation and <br/>
esoteric knowledge of spiritual truths that were held by ancient Gnostics. It <br/>
was pre-christianity and post, as it is still a movement today, just not a <br/>
well known movement. Karl Jung was a gnostic.The gamate of Gnostic arguments is <br/>
nearly as large as all other religious movements. Everything from an evil basis <br/>
to an omnipotent basis for creation. <br/>
<br/>
Agnostics would be an opposition to Gnostics. In that, it is the acceptance <br/>
of the unknown or the unknowable. There is not a search for the knowledge. <br/>
Therefore, Agnostics would be considered noncommital or undogmatic. Agnosticism <br/>
would be the movement of the view that God is unknown and unknowable.<br/>
<br/>
Astheist deny the existence of God. Atheism being the movement of denial of <br/>
God.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that helped.<br/>
<br/>
Rhonda - who followed Gnosticism for many years and still finds herself <br/>
swaying that way every now and again.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes Tuck, you are exactly right. The difference in Gnostic vs Agnostic in the <br/>
movements (ism&#39;s) is that Gnostic&#39;s are ACTIVELY searching out that knowledge <br/>
and Agnostics are NOT ACTIVELY searching out that knowledge. So Gnostic <br/>
foundation is about accepting the fact that an answer exist that one can <br/>
understand, Agnostic foundation is that is the knowledge of such an existance is not <br/>
provable and remains unknown due to the rejection of dogma.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that was clear. <br/>

<br/>
Yeah, I thought more along these lines:  &quot;What a crock.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a guy who writes for fundamentalists who claims to have been heavily <br/>
involved in withcraft, but it&#39;s just drama and bullshit, so he can pretend to <br/>
know what he&#39;s talking about.<br/>
<br/>
There was a travelling evangelist named &quot;Sister Cindy, The Disco Queen&quot; who <br/>
used to go to campuses and preach and pass the hat.  Her sermons were really <br/>
fascinating and the basis was that she was a disco slut and now she&#39;s saved, and <br/>
you can be too!    That she was a whore and Jesus made her a virgin again and <br/>
he could do the same for you!  <br/>
<br/>
That motif in religious proselytization is common. <br/>

probably won&#39;t, I guess I&#39;ll never really know. I recently turned down the <br/>
offer to read something called &quot;A Case for Christ&quot;, basically for the reasons <br/>
named above. <br/>

Maybe he was an Atheist simply because that&#39;s what he&#39;d been raised around and it wasn&#39;t a belief he had because of his own research and thought.<br/>
Perhaps he just accepted a belief without questioning it, and when he finally started questioning and wanted to prove something, he came up with answers that pointed to a different path for him.<br/>

Just as many, many Christians accept what they are taught, I suppose there are families that don&#39;t believe in God where they don&#39;t talk about it. If there isn&#39;t dialogue and deep thought going on around a child, they sometimes simply accept it.<br/>
<br/>
And maybe he just didn&#39;t have a belief system and when he searched, God made more sense to him than a universe without a God? Who knows.<br/>

I just don&#39;t see that it&#39;s any stranger for an atheist to decide there IS a supreme being than it is for a Christian to decide there isn&#39;t.<br/>

<br/>
But I would think it would be MUCH stranger for an atheist to &quot;find Jesus&quot; <br/>
than for a Christian to &quot;lose&quot; him.<br/>

true.<br/>
<br/>
WHERE DO PETS COME FROM?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;<br/>
 &gt; A newly discovered chapter in the Book of Genesis has provided the answer<br/>
 &gt; to &quot;Where do pets come from?&quot;<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; Adam and Eve said, &quot;Lord, when we were in the garden, you walked with us<br/>
 &gt; every day. Now we do not see you anymore. We are lonesome here and it is<br/>
 &gt; difficult for us to remember how much you love us.&quot;<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; And God said, &quot;No problem! I will create a companion for you that will be<br/>
 &gt; with you forever and who will be a reflection of my love for you, so that<br/>
 &gt; you will love me even when you cannot see me. Regardless of how <br/>
 </span></blockquote>selfish or<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; childish or unlovable you may be, this new companion will accept you as<br/>
 &gt; you are and will love you as I do, in spite of yourselves.&quot;<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; And God created a new animal to be a companion for Adam and Eve. And it<br/>
 &gt; was a good animal. And God was pleased. And the new animal was pleased to<br/>
 &gt; be with Adam and Eve and he wagged his tail.<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; And Adam said, &quot;Lord, I have already named all the animals in the Kingdom<br/>
 &gt; and I cannot think of a name for this new animal.&quot;<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; And God said, &quot;No problem. Because I have created this new animal to be a<br/>
 &gt; reflection of my love for you, his name will be a reflection of my own<br/>
 &gt; name, and you will call him DOG.&quot;<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; And Dog lived with Adam and Eve and was a companion to them and loved<br/>
 &gt; them. And they were comforted. And God was pleased. And dog was content<br/>
 &gt; and wagged his tail.<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; After a while, it came to pass that an angel came to the Lord and said,<br/>
 &gt; &quot;Lord, Adam and Eve have become filled with pride. They strut and preen<br/>
 &gt; like peacocks and they believe they are worthy of adoration. Dog has<br/>
 &gt; indeed taught them that they are loved, but perhaps too well.&quot;<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; And God said, &quot;No problem! I will create for them a companion who will be<br/>
 &gt; with them forever and who will see them as they are. The companion will<br/>
 &gt; remind them of their limitations, so they will know that they are not<br/>
 &gt; always worthy of adoration.&quot;<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; And God created CAT to be a companion to Adam and Eve. And Cat would not<br/>
 &gt; obey them. And when Adam and Eve gazed into Cat&#39;s eyes, they were <br/>
 </span></blockquote>reminded<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; that they were not the supreme beings.<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; And Adam and Eve learned humility.<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; And they were greatly improved.<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; And God was pleased.<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; And Dog was happy.<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; And Cat didn&#39;t care one way or the other.<br/>

from (T.H. Huxley coined it) and how its use has changed.<br/>

I believe his original intent was trying to find some convincing proofs to <br/>
disprove the existence of God to *others*, not himself.<br/>

the purposes of supporting his own argument for Atheism. Ironic how it <br/>

out though. &gt;&gt;<br/>

No, I seriously doubt it was irony.<br/>
I think it was rhetoric.  I think he described what he used to believe to<br/>
increase the contrast for his Christian audience.<br/>

But then again it&#39;s easy to be cynical about someone else&#39;s life changing <br/>
experience.  Can&#39;t possibly be real or sincere, must have always have a <br/>
hidden agenda.<br/>
