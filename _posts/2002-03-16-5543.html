<div id="ygrps-yiv-891453652">Today we went to our homeschooling weekly roller skating event.<br/>
Sometimes, toward the end of the hour and a half we&#39;re there, someone<br/>
from the skating rink announces games and races and whoever wants to<br/>
join in does.<br/>
<br/>
Recently, they started segmenting by age groups (perhaps it&#39;s a larger<br/>
group now) and having a one event race with a winner and a runner up.<br/>
Today, there was a different guy there calling the race.  He said,<br/>
&quot;Okay, first let&#39;s have all the girls come on out and race.&quot;  The whole<br/>
place got very quiet and I heard one kid gasp, &quot;What?&quot;   Long pause.<br/>
Nobody moved.  Finally, someone skated over to him, whispered and then<br/>
he said, &quot;Okay, everybody 8 and under&quot; and everything returned to<br/>
normal.<br/>
<br/>
I just thought it was funny and that it shows (perhaps) that<br/>
homeschoolers are used to being divided by age but not gender.<br/>

in racing it is a good thing). Nearly every home-school activity here in VA<br/>
is done according to age. This never happened with the people I knew in<br/>
England. We did rock climbing, indoor skiing, ice skating, art lessons, music<br/>
sessions, debating etc etc and nothing was ageist. All ages joined in<br/>
together.<br/>
One of the beauties of Home education is watching teenagers cooperating with<br/>
toddlers and the trust that builds up between the differnt ages. Sad not to<br/>
see that here :-)<br/>

children around since they might slow down her children.  Of course when<br/>
her sons were younger, she liked having the older children around!  I lost<br/>
all respect for her - she&#39;s a homeschooling &quot;leader&quot; here in the Bay Area.<br/>
So all the museum days, etc. are age segregated here.  I don&#39;t go to them<br/>
since I&#39;d rather go on my own and let my kids see what they want, how they<br/>
want!<br/>

things thru a new lense!<br/>
<br/>
I think the visits to museums with hs groups are funny when the staff try<br/>
to get the kids to line up. I remember watching about 40 mixed age hs kids<br/>
in Denver spend about 10 minutes trying to figure out the lining up thing.<br/>
The education staff (used of course to ps kids) were amazed but the moms<br/>
thought it really funny.<br/>

I&#39;ve noticed that too. Everything we did in the UK seemed to <br/>
involve all ages. Here it&#39;s so age segregated. The oldest kid we <br/>
know is 10. <br/>
