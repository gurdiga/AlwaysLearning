<div id="ygrps-yiv-684158552">Okay, so after the enduring conflict with the MIL, I finally snapped.<br/>
<br/>
Two days ago, we had a &#39;bor nahan&#39; its a ceremony where a child is showered<br/>
with food stuff (dry, sweet). Unfortunately, it was a traumatic experience<br/>
for Nisarga. He fell asleep waiting for the guests to arrive. Was rudely<br/>
awakened with a shower of strange things falling on his head. Even I was<br/>
wearing a traditional sari, which while soft, was a very strange experience<br/>
for him. I changed as quickly as I could, and took him into the bedroom to<br/>
calm and quieten (and clean). Traumatic, but okay, it was done.<br/>
<br/>
Today, the MIL came up with yet another ceremony idea (each time, she says<br/>
its the last until he becomes a year old - we&#39;ve had 4 of these &#39;lasts&#39; and<br/>
he&#39;s 4 months old). I said I was not comfortable with all this, and once<br/>
Nisarga was able to talk and make decisions, she could ask him herself,<br/>
until then, the answer was no.<br/>
<br/>
She gave me a long lecture about religious obligations toward my son, and<br/>
how irresponsible I was, and what not. Said son woke up, wanted attention. I<br/>
got up to take him in, she took him from me on the pretext of playing with<br/>
him. Lecture went on and on and on. Son got upset, started crying. Till this<br/>
point, I was calm, matter-of-fact. She kept ignoring all tactful prompts to<br/>
return him, knowing I&#39;d walk out once I got him. Son kept crying, hiccuping,<br/>
really upset.<br/>
<br/>
I blew a fuse and laid out my &#39;final word&#39;. Me no attend, son no attend, me<br/>
no pay. nada.<br/>
<br/>
She kept holding on to him, telling me that I don&#39;t deserve to stay in her<br/>
home and to go away and so on. I simply told her to return my son and we<br/>
could talk about this when I return. In the meanwhile to consider carefully<br/>
if she was serious about wanting me out. For one, her son and grandson would<br/>
be out with me. For another, if we took a loan to pay for a new home, we<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be able to afford to pay her any money for running the existing two<br/>
homes. Finally, her husband has chosen to live apart. She is telling us to<br/>
get out. Is this driving everyone away what she wants in life?<br/>
<br/>
Took son and walked out.<br/>
<br/>
I know I hurt her, but I think its better than us both going through the<br/>
continuing pain of expectations, dashed expectations, hurtful behaviour,<br/>
incompatible religious beliefs, etc.<br/>
<br/>
When I went out after Nisarga slept, she avoided the subject. I left it<br/>
alone figuring that if she really wants it, she will bring it up. Till then,<br/>
I&#39;m not going to trigger such subjects. Tempting as it feels to ditch her,<br/>
she isn&#39;t really sane enough to be let loose on the world, and her husband<br/>
and younger son couldn&#39;t care less. My husband cares, but if the choice is<br/>
his son and me and her.... nope. I care (I haven&#39;t suffered for as many<br/>
years), but this often gets on my nerves, particularly since the others just<br/>
shun her, and I can see how much she is hurt by that. It feels incredibly<br/>
powerless to see her doing those same things over and over and get hurt over<br/>
and over.<br/>
<br/>
So here I am. Wondering if this temporary subdued version that usually lasts<br/>
for two days is a good opportunity to also establish some ground rules on<br/>
her treatment of my son (playful hitting, forcibly turning his head away<br/>
from certain things, taking his toys away, etc) or if it would be like<br/>
hitting her when she&#39;s low.....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1431353045">I find it difficult ensure my dignity about being criticized and often<br/>

you can&#39;t enter the kitchen in your own home, can&#39;t eat the food when you<br/>
wish (no non-veg, eggs, onions, garlic, brinjals, and quite a few other<br/>

bath, are randomly ordered to do religious stuff because its some day or the<br/>
other (her sons are agnostic, I&#39;m atheist) to get the &quot;prasad - ritual meal<br/>

visitors because you don&#39;t put traditional child jewelery on your son, make<br/>
a fuss about other milk being given, pay him &quot;too much attention&quot;, and micro<br/>

power over everyone, they shun her or retaliate in cruel ways. I am<br/>
collateral damage.<br/>

I didn&#39;t bother to think of the impact of my words on her at that time.<br/>

can see if DH will support or at least be present.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1781744718">The first two paras didn&#39;t get posted at all from my email. Strange.<br/>
<br/>
I had appreciated your response and shared that I had not intended to hurt<br/>
her in that time. I had only tried to end the fruitless discussion and take<br/>
back my son, whom she was hanging on to, to prevent my exit. Her rant on my<br/>
sinful attitude and disrespect of God - where&#39;s the surprise? I&#39;m atheist,<br/>
and even if there was God, I don&#39;t think he&#39;d need me to bribe him to look<br/>
after my well being at the cost of hurting people around me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1582811201">***Talk of one woman cult...... It sometimes becomes an<br/>

<br/>
Are there some religious rituals you&#39;d be willing to participate in for the sake of peace?  It doesn&#39;t mean you need to believe in them.  When I visit my parents, I always participate in church and family prayers and sing-a-longs.  I do it because I love my parents and it&#39;s a way to a peaceful relationship with them and it does no harm to me to do it for their sake.<br/>
<br/>
If you can go along with some of the practices, even if you don&#39;t believe in it, it might help your m-i-l to relax enough where you could discuss the other more important things such as forcefulness towards your son, or how one gets to eat in their own home.  Like you said, it&#39;s not your respect she wants, it&#39;s the respect of her husband and sons.... She won&#39;t get that until she can relax and play nice and maybe apologize.  <br/>
<br/>
I got along really well with John&#39;s, my hubby, step-grandma.  There wasn&#39;t a history with us and I could take her from the moment I met her and accept who she was at that point.  The rest of the family had a long and ugly history with her and didn&#39;t care for her much.  As she got older, she softened and tried very hard to make up for her cruelty, with little affect.  I was one of the few people in which she was able to practice her niceness on and it helped her a lot, I think.<br/>
<br/>
People can soften with age.  People are softer when treated softer.  Although some people really aren&#39;t in places where they can change and your m-i-l might not be there yet.  Since we can&#39;t change others, the only thing we can change is how we interact with them.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1499617399">Thank you Jenny, I do participate in a lot of rituals simply because she<br/>
wants it. However, it is not a case of appreciating what I do. Its about<br/>
every time I don&#39;t - less than perfect. Offensive by not being fully<br/>
worshipping. Basically, my status as atheist makes my existence offensive<br/>
lol. This is a dead end.<br/>
<br/>
I do get value from your post though. I see the importance of staying<br/>
connected and appreciative of her (much as I want to run for the hills at<br/>
times) for our collective well being as well. She does listen to suggestions<br/>
from me at times. I will try to be more alive to such possibilities and see<br/>
how I can be more soft about how I put them. I try, but I&#39;m not certain I<br/>
achieve it many times. This is a good reminder to &quot;stay with the program&quot; so<br/>
to say.<br/>
<br/>
Your sharing about your experience also brings home the impact that while I<br/>
am collateral damage, I also am a bridge between two sides. I may not want<br/>
that role, but it is. If I can&#39;t change it, how can I be alive to it so that<br/>
I use it not just to make my life livable, but to invite opportunities for<br/>
finding joy for my family as well?<br/>
<br/>
Hmm... tough one, but certainly worth taking on. Thank you for this insight.<br/>
