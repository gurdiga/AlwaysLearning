<div id="ygrps-yiv-1718498189">Hello all,<div><br><div>I&#39;d appreciate some help brainstorming unschooling session topics for a Homeschool Unconference in my local area.</div><div><br></div><div>The unconference will be a small gathering held three weeks after HSC&#39;s summer conference. I&#39;d like to preface my question by encouraging everyone in the California Bay Area and beyond to attend HSC&#39;s Adventures in Unschooling Conference, which happens July 31-August 3rd in Santa Clara. &nbsp;Sandra will be speaking, along with many other inspiring guests. &nbsp;Special rates expire tomorrow, April 15th, so register now!</div><div>&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hscconference.com/main.html">http://www.hscconference.com/main.html</a></div><div><br></div><div>In my local area, I&#39;m interested in leading an unconference session on unschooling. &nbsp;My goals are to raise interest, convey principles, and foster connections between parents. &nbsp;One idea I had was to lead a discussion based on the Facebook group &quot;My Unschooler is Interested In...&quot; &nbsp;Participants could identify one of their child&#39;s interests, and fellow parents could help brainstorm ideas and resources for them. &nbsp;We could chart this on paper and hand it to them at the end of the session.</div><div><br></div><div>Unconference sessions are informal and collaborative, which is great for me because I&#39;m not comfortable speaking in groups for very long! &nbsp;Does anyone have any feedback or suggestions for me on running a successful unschooling session?</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you,</div><div><br></div><div>Barb Matessa</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div></div>
