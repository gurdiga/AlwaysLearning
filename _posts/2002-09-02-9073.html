&lt;&lt; At night Dylan chooses a little stuffed animal to sleep with, wraps it<br/>
tenderly in the bundle of quilt and afghan he&#39;s had since he was a baby<br/>
and talks kindly to it.  &quot;I hope you don&#39;t mind being wrapped up, I hope<br/>
I don&#39;t squish you, you can squeak if you need something...&quot;  He kisses<br/>
it tenderly and snuggles it down beside him and then, this happened last<br/>
night, he said, &quot;I want to go to the public meeting on the EPA river<br/>
clean up proposal on the 17th.&quot;  <br/>

small!!! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I want to take these two over to unschooling.com in some semi-permanent &lt;g&gt; <br/>
folder.  Any objections?<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe a webpage.  <br/>
<br/>
Any other of these not-&quot;acting-their-age&quot; stories to add?<br/>
<br/>
I ALWAYS despised roundly any mention of &quot;act your age&quot; when I was a kid.<br/>
(I guess I still do!)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One little one from yesterday, but not as funny.  Dylan and I went bird<br/>
watching and I&#39;ve been trying to learn bird taxonomy, listening to tapes,<br/>
mostly.  I was looking at ducks and geese and grebes and such and he was<br/>
squatting by the edge of the water, dropping little stones on the algae<br/>
bloom and making a face like a fish with his cheeks sucked in and his<br/>
lips sticking out.  He looked so little and child like squatting there,<br/>
and really engrossed in plopping the stones and I was mumbling about<br/>
never remembering who was who, bird wise, and he said, without looking up<br/>
- &quot;blue is discors, green is crecca and cinnamon is cyanoptera&quot;.  <br/>
Blue-winged Teal, Green-winged Teal and Cinnamon Teal ducks.   Just like<br/>
that.  <br/>
