<div id="ygrps-yiv-39448059">Heya<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not entirely sure if this is the right/best place to ask this; if not,<br/>
or if you know of someone who might have an answer, please feel free to<br/>
forward along...<br/>
<br/>
I know some of you have nontraditional guardianship arrangements with other<br/>
unschooling families, should something happen to you and your children need<br/>
to be cared for. I&#39;m in the process of arranging my advance directives, etc,<br/>
and guardianship for my kids. The thing I&#39;m wondering about is, the person<br/>
we&#39;ve agreed would be the best person to hold guardianship of our children<br/>
should something happen to us, is in another country.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone done anything like this? What kinds of legal requirements were<br/>
there?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

&quot;I can’t understand why people are frightened of new ideas. I’m frightened<br/>
of the old ones.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1517405945">My sister is in another country and she will have guardianship of the<br/>
children should anything happen to us. We had a lawyer helping us set up our<br/>
will/estate plan. It was pretty straight forward, just naming her and the<br/>
address. The children have double nationality, and they speak the language.<br/>
The only issue with our plan is that she&#39;s not homeschooling or unschooling,<br/>
and they would have to go to school with their cousins. I still think she&#39;s<br/>
the best option because she&#39;s the only family we have, we have a very close<br/>
relationship and we are very good friends.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1137236550">For Americans, what would happen with social security checks?   (I  <br/>
don&#39;t know what the equivalent might be in other countries, but can  <br/>
they go across borders?)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-230057085">Social Security checks do not depend on residence.   Many seniors these days<br/>
are moving abroad where their checks go further.   I know you were referring<br/>
to the minor survivor checks but it is &quot;all&quot;  &quot;social security&quot;.<br/>
You are old enough to remember Jim Jones and Jonestown.  Part of the outrage<br/>
about it was that not only were social security checks being sent but also<br/>
state funds for foster children.<br/>
