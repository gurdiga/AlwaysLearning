<div id="ygrps-yiv-209634592">Thank you everyone for giving me your feedback.... I&#39;m going to just let him<br/>
do what he wants.  I wouldn&#39;t stop him having a playdate for 5 hours, I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t stop him reading, learning math, or doing anything else for 5 hours<br/>
(not that I can think off anyway) so why this?<br/>
