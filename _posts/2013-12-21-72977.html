<div id="ygrps-yiv-1948663152">Maybe it&#39;s more like &quot;wonder&quot; and puzzles, sometimes, but I discovered last night that I have several Just Add Light and Stir entries about mystery, and mysteries.  <br/>
<br/>
I gathered them into one place, here:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://thinkingsticks.blogspot.com/2013/12/mysterious-mysteries.html">http://thinkingsticks.blogspot.com/2013/12/mysterious-mysteries.html</a><br/>
<br/>
After that, I went to the blog and searched for &quot;wonder,&quot; but that brought 60 or so and some were about wonder and some had lesser wonders. :-)<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s something healthy and uplifting and feeling the sense of mystery and wonder in the little things around you, and this is a good season for it.<br/>
