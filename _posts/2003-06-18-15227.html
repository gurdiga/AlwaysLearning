<br/>
It&#39;s kind of an online cartoon, but more it&#39;s animation and just funny <br/>
word-humor.  Combination of all, WITH some singing (Flag Day, Dragon, Lures and <br/>
Jigs, Techno, Guitar) (Marty&#39;s telling me...)<br/>
<br/>
He showed me a few.  It&#39;s really clever, and not like anything else I&#39;ve <br/>
seen.  Lots of art humor (Dragon).<br/>
<br/>
He says there&#39;s not bad language or very offensive stuff.  He beats up on his <br/>
little brother, says Marty.  <br/>
<br/>
Strong Bad.  Answering his e-mail.  Very interesting.</div>
