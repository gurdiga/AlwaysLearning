<div id="ygrps-yiv-1337103167">My son has an 8yo friend who comes over fridays to play. His mom and<br/>
me are not hanging out friends,she drops him off .We are friendly tho.<br/>
She also has a 3yo. that i have babysat for but the three of<br/>
them(Lukas,Steven and Matt)are just too much.Her husband just got out<br/>
of jail. He was in for a year,something with stealing a boat motor.<br/>
I met him and when he was in our house he asked to use the bathroom<br/>
and was in there an awlfully long time(no,he wasn&#39;t number twoing,lol)<br/>
I and my husband had a feeling he was snooping. He always seems to tag<br/>
along with his wife. This guy is a 6&#39;6&#39; duffus..not right if ya know<br/>
what i mean. Today Steven was over for a few hours when all of a<br/>
sudden i see Her car pull up. I figure she&#39;s picking Steven up. She<br/>
and her husband and MAtt come walking up. I was just sitting down to<br/>
eat. I asked her&quot;oh,your picking him up early? She said no,she has to<br/>
use my computer to put something on her floppy. I said i was just<br/>
eating.she said that&#39;s okay(NO farking,oh sorry we&#39;ll come back)<br/>
NO&lt;FARKING ASKING if she can use my computer!!! JUst all of them<br/>
walking in!! My house is too small for that crap and i had the 3 boys<br/>
to deal with plus her lurch husband standing here. Was she rude?? Why<br/>
couldn&#39;t she leave her husband home?? He could of stayed home with<br/>
little Matt. I am about to fire off an email telling her how i feel<br/>
but that will risk her son playing with mine.<br/>
What would you do??</div>

I&#39;d try to maintain the friendship opportunity for my child.  If it&#39;s  <br/>
about the kids and not about you, that makes it easier to decide.<br/>

I would try to keep the friendship for my son but I wouldn&#39;t let this person<br/>
walk all over me either.  I wouldn&#39;t be rude about it but I think you can<br/>
express the fact that you would appreciate it if she called or asked first<br/>
before she barged into your home.  I know that my children would understand<br/>
if I explained to them what happened.  Just like I would protect them from<br/>
that kind of boundary violation (or help them to protect themselves) I would<br/>
also protect myself.  I would tell them beforehand how I felt and what I was<br/>
doing so it wouldn&#39;t come as a surprise if she reacted badly or kept her<br/>
child away.  If they expressed real distress at the idea of me confronting<br/>
the other mom, I would at least explain to them that if the same situation<br/>
happened again, I would have to act differently and I would have to protect<br/>
myself and my own boundaries.<br/>
<br/>
I think you teach your children something when you let people treat you<br/>
badly as well as when you stop people from treating them badly.<br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts.<br/>

<br/>
I guess the difference might involve motive and communication.<br/>
<br/>
If I &quot;stand up for myself&quot; at my child&#39;s expense, I&#39;m not necessarily  <br/>
teaching them a great thing.  If my child has a friend and I don&#39;t  <br/>
like the mom as much as they like the friend, then I find ways to get  <br/>
them together without it involving parents, and not in unfriendly  <br/>
ways, just different places and times and I try to make sure the  <br/>
child can maintain that friendship.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s traditional for parents to put their comfort ahead of their  <br/>
childrens&#39; and it&#39;s the easy way for the parents, maybe, but not so  <br/>
fair to the children.<br/>

<br/>
This is basically what I was thinking.  I don&#39;t think I said stand up for<br/>
herself at her child&#39;s expense but, rather, in conjunction and partnership<br/>
with her child though I may not have expressed that fully.<br/>
<br/>
All I meant was she doesn&#39;t have to put up with the way this woman seems to<br/>
be treating her and the rest of her family.  I don&#39;t think she should<br/>
disregard her son&#39;s feelings (and if that is what it sounded like I was<br/>
saying, that is totally not what I meant), but I also don&#39;t agree with<br/>
letting that kind of treatment pass and I wouldn&#39;t let it happen again.<br/>
<br/>
***If it&#39;s about the kids and not about you, that makes it easier to<br/>
decide.***<br/>
<br/>
I think it can be about the kids and about you as well.  In fact, I thought<br/>
that was the whole point.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t make my child put up with rude intrusive behavior so that I could<br/>
see my friend and I would not put up with that kind of behavior so that my<br/>
child could have a friend.  That being said, I didn&#39;t mean that &quot;put up with<br/>
it or no friend&quot; are the only two options.  I would hope that her son can<br/>
have her friend and she doesn&#39;t have to take that kind of treatment.<br/>

Thanks for letting us know things are being resolved.  I&#39;m glad the  <br/>
girls&#39; friendship will survive a while more (maybe for life).<br/>
