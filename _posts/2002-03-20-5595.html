<br/>
We used to meet weekly or more in public parks.  Sometimes a busload of <br/>
schoolkids would show up (usually a pre-school coming there for lunch or <br/>
play, sometimes a mid-school track team, or whatever).   Marty, when he was <br/>
six and seven, would shoot straight up like a prairie-dog lookout and yell <br/>
&quot;SCHOOL KIDS!&quot; and start gathering up our play equipment like we had to be <br/>
OUT of there before the last of them touched the grass.    It was partly a <br/>
joke, but it had happened several times that our park sessions were ruined by <br/>
other kids coming up, being stingy with the slides, taking our kids&#39; buckets <br/>
and shovels and balls away from them, just getting on their bikes and riding, <br/>
etc.  The difference in behavior was notable.<br/>
<br/>
But I always smile when I think of Marty&#39;s reaction.  Still now if we&#39;re at a <br/>
zoo or museum and a school group is coming, he&#39;ll elbow me and nod toward the <br/>
direction we should escape.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I like to just stay and let the whole group wash over me and pass <br/>
on.  It&#39;s a good reminder that my kids ARE learning and are thoughtful and <br/>
more safe at home (emotionally, socially, morally).<br/>
<br/>
Holly always wants to discuss the kids&#39; behavior, and it surprises her most <br/>
that they&#39;re ignoring the cool stuff--museum displays, animals, or <br/>
whatever--in favor of just playing around or pushing each other, or running <br/>
back and forth.  I try to tell her that they&#39;re not used to freedom and large <br/>
spaces. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s interesting to me to see her first impressions of information about <br/>
school.  It&#39;s just not the same to hear about it as to grow up in it.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday morning Holly was talking to me about dessert and meals.  That was <br/>
the first time she found out that some families make kids clean their plates, <br/>
and that they purposely rotate through vegetables the kids don&#39;t like, and <br/>
make them eat them or they don&#39;t get dessert.  She looked at me with true <br/>
surprise.  I mentioned &quot;liver&quot; and &quot;tongue&quot; (both things my husband&#39;s mom <br/>
subjected him to; I myself liked liver, but my parents were hunters and it <br/>
was usually venison).  She had never heard of a family doing that.  I asked <br/>
if she knew any families where the kids couldn&#39;t eat a snack before a meal.  <br/>
She said no, but sometimes the snacks were just crackers or something the <br/>
kids didn&#39;t want.<br/>
<br/>
A few hours later, Holly came and said this cute but sad thing:  She said she <br/>
guessed in a family where the parents were going to force the kids to eat <br/>
things they didn&#39;t like for dinner, that if those kids went to school they <br/>
could just eat a really big lunch so they could last until breakfast.  I told <br/>
her school lunches were famously small.  She said &quot;Not in England!&quot;  but on <br/>
questioning, she said they could have had several sides, but only one entree.<br/>
<br/>
She told me a few weeks ago (over a year after it happening) about one of the <br/>
girls at the school she visited in England looking over at Holly&#39;s lunch tray <br/>
and saying &quot;You forgot your pudding.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Holly looked at her tray, at the other girl&#39;s tray, at her friend Jasmine&#39;s <br/>
tray, and said &quot;I didn&#39;t see any pudding.&quot;  The girl pointed at her little <br/>
cake.   They use &quot;pudding&quot; generically for any dessert, but Holly didn&#39;t know <br/>
that, and as she&#39;s not dessert-trained, she had just passed by the cakes and <br/>
such.<br/>
<br/>
A question for the Brits on the list:  She really liked the entree, and said <br/>
it was a meat layer with mashed potatoes on top, and a pattern on top of the <br/>
mashed potatoes.  What was that?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1809684328">Monday we were at the YMCA for Dana&#39;s swim class.  Dana was in the pool and<br/>
I was in the hallway watching.  Down the steps comes a (school)teacher<br/>
followed by at least 30 children age 6 or 7.  Teacher instructed the<br/>
children to MARCH, and was saying left, left, left right left.  I turned<br/>
around in amazement, actually I was appalled.  The children were not allowed<br/>
to talk, touch or stop and watch the kids in the pool, just march to their<br/>
bus.  I was sad.  Dana is part of a homeschool gym/swim thingie at the YMCA<br/>
on tuesdays.  They treat the kids so differently.  No parent marches them<br/>
upstairs to the gym for the first hour, no one directs the kids to their<br/>
parents(or not, the olders are able to do their own thing) after gym to get<br/>
ready for swim - they just let our kids go - which I LOVE.  The kids range<br/>
in age from 5 to 13.  If a little has to potty while they are in the gym,<br/>
one of the instructors will bring them downstairs IF the child requests<br/>
assistance, if not the kids can do what they need to do by themselves.  The<br/>
way the children do things together makes me feel so happy for Dana.<br/>
<br/>
When we do park day or other outings, we seem to automatically huddle<br/>
together until the mass hysteria of school kids pass or we pack up and end<br/>
park play.  It is just too overwhelming to be in their presence.<br/>
<br/>
My mom always says Dana could become a vegetarian no problem, that kid will<br/>
pick veggies(just about any kind) before anything else on her plate - most<br/>
times she skips her meat altogether.  I always offer the meat cause just in<br/>
case she is in the mood for it.<br/>
<br/>
The meat thing with potato layer - could it be shepards pie??  Just a<br/>
non-brit answer =)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>At the performing arts center where I work we do many performances for<br/>
schoolchildren.  I am able to arrange tickets for some of these performances<br/>
for homeschool groups that I have a connection to.<br/>
<br/>
The house staff has quite a set of procedures for filling an auditorium of<br/>
that can hold 1500 people with school groups.  Busses often arrive hours<br/>
before the performance, sometimes before any of the performers and staff.<br/>
There is lining up, escorting through the lobby, and having an usher going<br/>
down each row with the students, pointing to each seat they need to sit in.<br/>
To head off non-productive interaction, the high school students are<br/>
segregated from the primary students.<br/>
<br/>
I usually meet my group of homeschoolers 15 minutes before the show out in<br/>
front of the theater where the kids (and adults) chat with their friends<br/>
they haven&#39;t seen in a while or start playing games, and generally start<br/>
having fun from the minute they arrive.  When it&#39;s our time to go into the<br/>
theater, some of the kids have fun &quot;lining up&quot; most of them make fun of it,<br/>
and we take our seats without much supervision.<br/>
<br/>
Afterward, I am often leading tours backstage for the homeschoolers.  So our<br/>
group has to wait for the House to clear, and for the stage crew to make it<br/>
safe enough for the tour.  So we chat about the show and answer questions<br/>
while we watch the school kids march out to their buses.<br/>
<br/>
The contrast between the groups is quite profound.<br/>
<br/>
**Almost without exception, members of the House staff talk to me afterward<br/>
about how polite, courteous, and pleasant my group had been. Or they comment<br/>
on what good questions they were asking me.**<br/>

school groups there.  I noticed that one of the groups had handed<br/>
out notebooks with questions that their students needed to answer.<br/>
I thought how sad that those children couldn&#39;t just relax and enjoy<br/>
the place.  My children learn so much every time we visit - they<br/>
had to show Rob all their favorite places - he&#39;s been working too<br/>
much lately and hasn&#39;t been able to go with us.   Rob and I were <br/>
much more relaxed when all the school groups left.  I don&#39;t think<br/>
Megan and Alex even noticed them - the aquarium is much too interesting<br/>
for them!<br/>
