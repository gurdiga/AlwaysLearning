&lt;&lt; I agree.  But if I did find out &quot;unsavory&quot; things about people my <br/>
 children were associating with, taking lessons from...I would put my <br/>
 guard up.  I guess that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing now. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But over one conversation? It sounds like you were fine with everything until <br/>
one person told you some ratty gossip (no pun intended) and then suddenly you <br/>
weren&#39;t so sure about it.<br/>
If someone warned me that a person in charge of an activity we were involved <br/>
with was a pedophile, or abusive in some way, that might put my guard up.<br/>
But affairs happen every day (no, I&#39;m not excusing the rotten behavior, just <br/>
being realistic) and you don&#39;t even know about it usually. If you were <br/>
unaware of any &quot;unsavory&quot; behavior before, why let what one person tells you <br/>
stop your enjoyment of the group?<br/>
Of course, if there are other issues like the taking control from the <br/>
children, that is understandable.<br/>
I think most of the people you meet and deal with in life have some <br/>
&quot;unsavory&quot; things that you might be surprised about. This doesn&#39;t mean <br/>
unsafe, or not a worthy person to learn from.<br/>
If you didn&#39;t notice that there was some affair going on, chances are your <br/>
kids didn&#39;t.<br/>
In this case I would say it should be totally up to them whether to leave or <br/>
not.<br/>
If it were a safety issue I would feel differently, but it&#39;s not about safety.<br/>
You don&#39;t know yet whether the adults being in acting parts is something <br/>
negative or positive, so let your kids decide at what level they will or <br/>
won&#39;t participate.....you can always re-evaluate at a future date.<br/>
I bet someone could tell you gossip about practically any group that might <br/>
make you feel differently about them....that doesn&#39;t mean you have to drop <br/>
all activities with them.<br/>
