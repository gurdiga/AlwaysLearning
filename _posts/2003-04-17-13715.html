&lt;&lt; We have sorted all that out with our wills and here in NZ you can make <br/>
your house a joint family home which, to simplify, means that whoever has the <br/>
kids has the house.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What a GREAT idea!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Do the kids have to agree to sell it too?<br/>
<br/>
My dad sold our house out from under us while I was away at college.  I found <br/>
out from the neighbor who had bought the orchard that our other neighbor was <br/>
buying the house.  I burst into tears.  I&#39;ve never told my kids this story.  <br/>
I was hitchhiking home for the weekend, with my boyfriend from India, and we <br/>
were picked up in Santa Fe by Mr. Vigil, who lived right behind us, and who <br/>
taught Spanish at Santa Fe High.  In the first five minutes of the half hour <br/>
ride, I was crying.  I was seventeen and hadn&#39;t even known the house had been <br/>
put up for sale.   <br/>
<br/>
Just the whiff of this New Zealand law brought that memory swirling up.  It <br/>
seems hugely fair and wonderful from a kid&#39;s point of view.<br/>
<br/>
GOOD!!!<br/>
