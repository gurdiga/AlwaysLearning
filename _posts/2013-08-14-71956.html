<div id="ygrps-yiv-1224770190">Realised my earlier post should be titled end of year reporting for life <br/>
learners, for that is the ball I wish to toss in for volleying in this <br/>
grand court.<br/>
<br/>
I am reading, so as to gain confidence and return to the higher mindset, <br/>
away from fear of authorities and establishments and order, on to the <br/>
truth of what we are doing by learning and living in a different way.<br/>
<br/>
Comparing apples to frogs, it is, and so I must write, but in a fear <br/>
place it is hard to wax eloquent about our learning. I need to get <br/>
quiet, be still, and feel and think, and I do appreciate that <br/>
encoragement typed here, to think, to get quiet.<br/>
<br/>
  I do feel I am an observer and a responder and an advocate for my <br/>
family. To summarise our &quot;learning progress&quot; is on my plate to do.</div>
