<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;Maybe we can train him,&quot; said Mrs. Popper. &quot;Bad, naughty Captain,&quot; she said<br/>
&gt; to the penguin in a loud voice. &quot;Bad to eat the goldfish.&quot; And she spanked<br/>
&gt; him on his round, black head.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Haven&#39;t read to see if he ate anymore goldfish. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, do read on.  Mrs. Popper has her problems, but the book&#39;s hilarious.<br/>
I&#39;d always liked it, and when Tim read it, there was constant giggling<br/>
coming from the couch he was lying on.<br/>
