<div id="ygrps-yiv-1580830599">My total hatred of High School and all of the restrictions trying to be<br/>
placed on who I was... has now come full circle and has totally helped me to<br/>
deschool at an alarming rate.  I also take everything to heart (I don&#39;t take<br/>
it personally... though I was just a bit defensive at first... I DO listen<br/>
and internalize and think and rationalize) everything that Sandra, Ren,<br/>
Susan McGlohn, Joyce F, Kelly Lovejoy, and others who have <br/>
been-there-done-that&quot;...<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re coming up on our first anniversary of homeschooling and very shortly<br/>
there after unschooling (I think I had thrown all of the curriculum out the<br/>
window by December)... and I have learned so much and changed so much and<br/>
let go of so much.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess my point on all of this is... for those who are still struggling, to<br/>
just let it go and TRUST!  Life will NOT stop and come crashing down around<br/>
you.  Let go of what&#39;s holding you back from LIVING life to the fullest.  We<br/>
CHOOSE our life course... we really do.<br/>

Yeah, but don&#39;t trust US.  Trust your children&#39;s inate desire and  <br/>
ability to learn and be good and become a whole adult.  Trust  <br/>
yourself to figure it out (and then try to figure it out).<br/>
<br/>
I never just say &quot;trust me&quot; to anyone.  I try to give them logical  <br/>
reasons, and try to explain why I think what I think.  In the case of  <br/>
unschooling, people trust it because they see it work with kids-- <br/>
maybe their own kids or maybe they get lucky and get a speed boost  <br/>
early on by seeing unschooled kids.  I did!<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby was three or four we joined  a babysitting co-op.   Most  <br/>
of the members were La Leche League leaders.  Four families  <br/>
homeschooled.  Two used structure.  Two were unschooling families.<br/>
<br/>
Cool for us, huh?<br/>
<br/>
We weren&#39;t considering homeschooling yet at the time we met them all,  <br/>
and by the time we were, I knew that the unschooling families got  <br/>
along better and the kids were nicer and not sneaky or destructive.<br/>

Of course I don&#39;t trust you!  LOL... no seriously, I trust your truth for<br/>
you and that is a catalyst for me to find my own truth.  What I meant by<br/>
trust is to trust yourself and your kids... like this quote that Ren said a<br/>
few months back that I instantly put on my blog and it&#39;s now the background<br/>
on my desktop on the computer.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Unschooling is all about relationships and trust. You can&#39;t get trust by<br/>
hurting someone on purpose to teach them some lesson. You aren&#39;t going to<br/>
get to unschooling until you take the leap and choose to trust.&quot;<br/>
