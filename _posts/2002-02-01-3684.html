<div id="ygrps-yiv-1976749317">That Ghandi saying was tooooo funny!<br/>

<br/>
&quot;The holy hand grenade&quot; scene of The Holy Grail is hilarious. We especially <br/>
love the dark knight that just wouldn&#39;t give up &quot;All right then, we&#39;ll call <br/>

<br/>
Too many goofy lines from that movie!<br/>
<br/>
I needed a good laugh tonight..<br/>
