I learned that I really enjoy fantasy after all from my kids! If you look at older books- Jane Austen for example, Inkheart is newer, there are characters either out of school or homeschooled. My kids were ok with school in books/ movies, and much more interested in the stories being told. School was like part of the costume in a play or a description, not something to be bothered about.</p></blockquote><style type="text/css">

<div id="ygrps-yiv-682021928">We also keep an eye out for non-schoolish books, and some of our favorites are the Swallows and Amazons series by Arthur Ransom, about four siblings who have free reign to sail and explore all over the Lake District, camping on deserted islands, exploring caves, etc.. Jean George&#39;s trilogy that begins with My Side of the Mountain is another wonderful classic series of children working and living their passions. We also loved the newer Penderwicks series by Jean Birdsall-- most of the books take place in the summer, and the children have lovely, supportive parents and lots of exciting adventures. Kelly Barnhill&#39;s The Witch&#39;s Boy exists in a world without school. Blue Baillett&#39;s novels, mysteries about art and architecture, also feature kids surrounded by supportive adults, and include quiet, thoughtful critiques of formal education-- one of the best adults is 4th grade teacher who tries to deconstruct her classroom. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-802583765"><html><head></head><div>Oh, I so loved all Gerald Durrell&#39;s books when I was a kid- I should read them again; thank you for the wonderful reminder. My son (11) might also enjoy them.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>One other book suggestion to look at would be Surviving the Applewhites, by Stephanie Tolan. The family (artsy and rather eccentric) have a free-form kind of home school called The Creative Academy. One of the characters actually wants more structure, if my memory is correct. It&#39;s not quite unschooling but it is unschooling-ish and very well written (it won the Newberry award): &nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surviving_the_Applewhites">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surviving_the_Applewhites</a></div><div><br></div><div>I also came across a young teen novel a few years ago called the Homeschool Liberation &nbsp;League. It&#39;s about a girl who wants to unschool (after meeting an unschooler at camp). Her parents agree to try homeschooling but it&#39;s school-at-home, which is not what she wants. She does all kinds of rather academic stuff to prove to them that she can learn without imposed structure but they never really get on board. And I kind of think she may end up opting for an alternative school in the end. Disappointing in some ways, but not unrealistic. Might be an interesting one to look at:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/lucy-frank/the-homeschool-liberation-league/">https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/lucy-frank/the-homeschool-liberation-league/</a></div><div><br></div><div>I&#39;m actually an author- 20 books for kids and teens, and so far all the kids in those books are schooled- I think just because that was my own experience. My son said I should write one about an unschooler- so the current novel in progress is about a 12 year old unschooled girl (also time travel!). Anyway, assuming my usual publisher wants it, it&#39;ll be 2-3 years before that one is on the shelves...but I am having so much fun writing it. (Hopefully some of our story-loving kids will grow up to write some fabulous books about unschoolers- there is a real gap, and it gets tiresome reading about school all the time.)</div><div><br><div>Sent from my iPad</div></div></html></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-62857926">The Wanderer, by Sharon Creech, is beautifully written. The story takes place on a sail boat, so no school, and it is very much about self-discovery. The main character is 13 and an independent thinker. It&#39;s a quiet story- wouldn&#39;t appeal to every kid- but I think it is an exceptionally good one.<br/>
<br/>
A more exciting, faster paced read is Raider&#39;s Ransom, and the sequel Flood and Fire, both by Emily Diamand. Both are set in a future, slightly dystopian (but not too dark) world. The main characters are fabulously free, independent and unfettered, and it is a terrific adventure story (no school, no bullying, lots of humor, plus a cat, boats, rocket launchers and- in the second book- a terrific AI who may actually be an advanced gaming system). Highly recommend these ones! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-330044845">The Five Kingdom series by Brandon Mull is another great adventure story that is set outside of schools (and actually not on Earth).  The main characters are mostly kids (~11 years old) and they travel all through an alternate world called the Outskirts, having lots of adventures while trying to find their way back to Earth.  The story starts in school, but then quickly leaves that well behind.  The kids travel all over the place and no one ever wonders why they aren&#39;t in school and it doesn&#39;t seem like kids in the Outskirts even go to school.  This has been a fun read for me, but I should mention that only four of the five books are written currently (the last book won&#39;t come out until fall 2017).  The Beyonders by Brandon Mull is another book series with a similar premise to the Five Kingdoms books (different stories, though) and I would recommend that book as well for anyone who loves adventure stories.<br/>
<br/>
The Familiars by Adam Jay Epstein & Andrew Jacobson and the Wings of Fire dragon books are two other fun series that have nothing to do with school or school issues (it helps that the main characters aren&#39;t human I suppose!).The Land of Stories books by Chris Colfer is another series that we&#39;ve really enjoyed listening to as an audio book (the author reads his books and he is spectacular with voices!).  The main characters go to school, but the lead girl opts out of school after a while (and the stories have very little to do with school actually).  The two main characters, a brother and sister, have a very supportive and loving family and a good relationship with them (which isn&#39;t often the case in novels about teens).  My oldest thinks I should add the How to train Your Dragon books by Cressida Cowell to this list as well.  She says they are in pirate school, training to be pirates, but that it is nothing like regular school.  I haven&#39;t read those books yet, though, so I don&#39;t know how appropriate to the topic they really are.<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, my kids and I really love watching Curious George episodes.  Because he&#39;s a &quot;monkey&quot; (he&#39;s actually a chimpanzee I think, which is not a monkey) he doesn&#39;t have to go to school, so he is free to be curious about everything and has the time and support to explore all the things he&#39;s curious about.  Basically, he&#39;s a perfect example of unschooling in action!  <br/>

       The Wanderer, by Sharon Creech, is beautifully<br/>
 written. The story takes place on a sail boat, so no school,<br/>
 and it is very much about self-discovery. The main character<br/>
 is 13 and an independent thinker. It&#39;s a quiet story-<br/>
 wouldn&#39;t appeal to every kid- but I think it is an<br/>
 exceptionally good one.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A more exciting, faster paced read is Raider&#39;s Ransom,<br/>
 and the sequel Flood and Fire, both by Emily Diamand. Both<br/>
 are set in a future, slightly dystopian (but not too dark)<br/>
 world. The main characters are fabulously free, independent<br/>
 and unfettered, and it is a terrific adventure story (no<br/>
 school, no bullying, lots of humor, plus a cat, boats,<br/>
 rocket launchers and- in the second book- a terrific AI who<br/>
 may actually be an advanced gaming system). Highly recommend<br/>
 these ones! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-898543887"><p dir="ltr">Caitlin Moran isn&#39;t in favour of home education because of how it was handled in her family. I like her and I like the programme, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good advert for unschooling because of all the bits non unschoolers will see and focus on. And the mum is not involved enough, although I agree she is loving in her own way. Although they are clearly a close family unit, there&#39;s not much kindness within the family and that bugs me too.</p>

      <p>I&#39;m really excited to check out these book suggestions, thank you!</p><div><br></div><div>While we don&#39;t deliberately steer away from well written books set in school situations, it is nonetheless really nice to have a non school perspective reflected at us.  I have recently had another experience of how refreshing it is to have one&#39;s personal, maybe marginal, situation reflected in the mainstream media in a positive way, and has made me realise that it really does have some value, it is very helpful in somehow making one feel more relaxed with one&#39;s choices - look, we are not alone!!!</div><div><br></div><div>There is an increasingly well known journalist and author here in the UK called Caitlin Moran.  She worked in the music press mainly until she wrote &#39;How to Be A Woman&#39;.  She was home educated and the more I read about and find out about her childhood it looks a lot like unschooling to me.  Which by all accounts was very brave of her parents in the 1970&#39;s, without the internet.  Caitlin<span style="word-spacing:normal;"> realised there was nobody &#39;like her family&#39; represented on the television (home schooled and working class) and she and her sister have written a sit-com loosely based around their childhood.  It&#39;s called &#39;Raised By Wolves&#39; and is into it&#39;s second series on the UK Channel 4.  I have to say we all find it absolutely brilliant, if a little edgy - lots of swearing, smoking and sexual references - like in real families with teenagers ;-)  - but all with love and humour.  My 12 year old girl has seen all the episodes multiple times as she says the humour gets better with every viewing - she gets more of the jokes each time.</span></div><div><span style="word-spacing:normal;"><br></span></div><div><span style="word-spacing:normal;">I&#39;m not sure if it would translate at all well outside of the UK, I can&#39;t really tell how much of the humour is specific to our cultural references, and it IS an18 certificate, but somehow watching it has gladdened all our family (especially dad), and made us feel more culturally included.  I particularly like the episode where one of the daughters decides to go to school &#39;because she isn&#39;t learning anything&#39; at home.  She wants to learn calculus etc.  She is expelled on her first day as she is so appalled at the lack of respect for learning that she shouts &#39;doesn&#39;t anyone have any *****ing respect for Marco Polo in this classroom?&#39; or words to that effect.  She then enrols in the local adult ed college and has a ball with all the older folk there :-)</span></div><div><span style="word-spacing:normal;"><br></span></div><div><span style="word-spacing:normal;">Anyway, if you check it out, maybe do it without the children first if they are younger, and if anyone else has any similar recommendations that would be amazing - to be reflected, even if we are quite different to that family - really seems to have made a subtle but significant difference to how we feel about our place in our wider culture.</span></div><div><span style="word-spacing:normal;"><br></span></div><div>Any other thoughts on this idea of reflection?  Or anyone else got thoughts on that program?</div><div><span style="word-spacing:normal;"><br></span></div><div><span style="word-spacing:normal;"><br></span></div><div><span style="word-spacing:normal;"><br></span></div><p></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-218277257">I was just referring back to the books listed recently and thought our finds might be helpful for someone. <br>I&#39;d love more ideas, too! My 9 yo dislikes school environments but is sensitive about not being in school like most kids, so we choose audio books for the car that aren&#39;t really set there. <br><span style="font-weight:bold;"><br>My Side of the Mountain</span> (which has 2 sequels, though one is from the bird&#39;s point of view) and <span style="font-weight:bold;">From the Mixed Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler</span> were both WONDERFUL stories of kids who ran away from home to have adventures.&nbsp; <br><br><span style="font-weight:bold;">Pippi Longstocking </span><span>is another that we loved, and I know I&#39;ve seen it on another list of books for unschoolers that I just can&#39;t find again. (Anyone know of one?) The larger than life almost-orphan living alone with a horse and a monkey--oh, and did I mention she is the strongest girl in the world?--is just enchanting. She does try school for one day and both finds it silly, and also commits a number of faux pas because she doesn&#39;t understand the social conventions of school. I like the way this part is written, very silly but sympathetic to both Pippi and the teacher, to me anyway.<br><br>When K was 4, she spent hours a day listening to the whole <span style="font-weight:bold;">Magic Tree House</span> series by Mary Pope Osborne over and over. They go to school, but the stories don&#39;t happen there. I&#39;m just realizing now how similar those books are in focusing on kids freely choosing to tackle big, interesting challenges without being told exactly how to by adults. Merlin and Morgan, the magicians who give them their missions, respectfully treat the kids as people who are extremely capable.<br><br>Alex N.<br class="ygrps-yiv-218277257yui-cursor"></span></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-484436975">Books set in the past might be good, too—though lots of things I loved when I was a kid would be hard for kids to read now, with their too-long sentences and too-big words.  Thinking of Treasure Island.<br/>
<br/>
I liked the kids novels set in Saxon and Viking settings, by Henry Treece.  If any of those ever became audible books, that would be fun.  He wrote some adult things, too, so sort, sort out the kids’ things.<br/>
<br/>
Redwall books?  <br/>
<br/>
American Girl dolls have some books, but they’s way too school-heavy for my tastes, because Josefina Montoya was made to go to a school that doesn’t even exist. :-)  And the living history museum they based her character around has buildings from the 18th and 19th centuries (for real) and then an early 20th-century school building that was moved there for preservation, but it’s only subtly noted that the people who lived there had no such school, and that the school is from 200 miles and 150 years away.<br/>
<br/>
There are newer books, about unschoolers, by Lisa Cottrell-Bentley:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1462194150">Oh my gosh, Redwall! We loved those books so much. And there&#39;s lots of them- more than twenty I think- and they&#39;re long, so we were just immersed in that world for months. They&#39;re exciting, with battles and sword fights (among squirrels, and mice, and moles etc), but also incredibly sweet and cosy and comforting to read. The animals have the most wonderful feasts and my son and I followed suit: we invited my parents for dinner, made and printed out fancy illustrates menus with quotes from various Redwall characters, and cooked some of the foods from the books (Basil Stag Hare Leek Soup! &#39;Unnymoles! October Ale! Raspberry Fizz!). It was SO much fun. Feeling nostalgic now...hmm, I might have to reread those books. Thanks for the reminder, Sandra. <br/>
<br/>
We are reading a great trilogy now that my son is really loving (he is 12, but these would be great for younger or older as well): Leviathan, Behemoth and Goliath, by Scott Westerfield. Two young teens, and no school, but lots of airships and daring adventure and genetically engineered creatures, as well a fascinating alternate version of World War One... We learned some history and geography from looking up various things and going off on tangents, as one does... and there are gorgeous black and white illustrations. Kids who like them might also enjoy the wiki for the books online- these books also totally lend themselves to wonderful steampunk fan art. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1703807140"><div dir="ltr"><div><div>We also loved Ingrid Law&#39;s three books: <i>Savvy</i>, <i>Scumble</i> and <i>Switch. </i>The Beaumont children home-school, though with no apparent curriculum or schedule, because upon their 13th birthdays they acquire unique family traits--special abilities called savvies--that aren&#39;t terribly compatible with the expectations of school. The kids&#39; adventures reveal that they are as capable as any adult, and ultimately that everyone has special abilities if they trust themselves enough to discover them. The vocabulary is wide-ranging and fun; the characters are developed with wonderfully descriptive detail. Each book is told from the point of view of one of the children who just turned thirteen. Both of our kids LOVED these books. <br><br></div>Tori<br></div>Mama to Tolinka &amp; Obi, both 9 yrs<br></div></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-909742857"><br>Island of the Blue Dolphins, The Boxcar Children (they go to school, but I remember that the stories or most of it takes place away from school, during the summer and vacations).<br><br>The Chronicles of Narnia are good on audiobook. &nbsp;They were hard to read when I wanted to read them as a child (harder for me than Michael Crichton), but I loved them on audiobook later.&nbsp;<br><br>Cornelia Funke&#39;s books are fun and adventurous and have little or nothing to do with school- Dragon Rider, and The Thief Lord are my favorites.<br><br>Peter and the Starcatchers by Dave Barry and Ridley Pearson&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>His Dark Materials, a trilogy by Philip Pullman (better known maybe as The Golden Compass, The Subtle Knife, and The Amber Spyglass) -- really really beautiful story. &nbsp;Maybe a bit too much in places for sensitive children. Maybe read it first or read ahead to know where and what could be skipped or glossed over.<br><br>I read this series the first time as I was first becoming a mother and before leaving my job in early childhood education. I think they had a profound impact on the way my ideas about learning and parenting and teaching and what actually matters in life began to flow away from the schoolish paradigm I&#39;d been used to assuming as Truth. <br>They are definitely in my top ten list of favorite books.&nbsp;<br>The story begins in a University, but there is very little of the kind of mainstream school experience the original poster mentioned. The main character Lyra gets some ineffectual tutoring from the scholars there, but most of her learning happens outside of that, and it ends up being a minor thing in a much bigger story.<br><br><br>Lisa Celedon</div>
