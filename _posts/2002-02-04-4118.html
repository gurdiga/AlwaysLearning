<br/>
If you receive an e-mail entitled &quot;Badtimes&quot;, delete it immediately. Do not<br/>
open it. Apparently, this one is pretty nasty. It will not only erase<br/>
everything on your hard drive, but it will also delete anything on disks<br/>
within 20 feet of your computer. It demagnetizes the strips on all your<br/>
credit cards. It reprograms your ATM access code, screws up the tracking on<br/>
your VCR and uses subspace field harmonics to scratch any CD&#39;s you attempt<br/>
to <br/>
play.<br/>
<br/>
If you drive a chevy, it will start missing like a Ford. It will program<br/>
your <br/>
phone auto dial to call only your mother-in-law&#39;s number. This virus will<br/>
mix <br/>
antifreeze into your fish tank. It will drink all your beer. It will leave<br/>
dirty socks on the coffee table when you are expecting company.<br/>
<br/>
It will replace your shampoo with Nair and your Nair with Rogaine, all the<br/>
while dating your spouse behind your back and billing your Visa. It will<br/>
cause you to run with scissors then fall and poke your eye out.<br/>
<br/>
If the &quot;Badtimes&quot; message is opened in a Windows 95/98 environment, it will<br/>
leave the toilet seat up and leave your hair dryer plugged in dangerously<br/>
close to a full bathtub. It will not only remove the forbidden tags from<br/>
your <br/>
mattresses and pillows, it will also refill your skim milk with whole milk.<br/>
<br/>
PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF PETE, WARN AS MANY PEOPLE AS YOU CAN!<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t send this to 5,000 people in 20 seconds you&#39;ll fart so hard<br/>
that <br/>
your right leg will spasm and shoot straight out in front of you, sending<br/>
sparks that will ignite the person nearest you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2008130256">Jeez, Joyce, I guess I&#39;ll just have to shut down the computer for the rest of <br/>
my life!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for a good laugh and a chance to think about how interconnected we all <br/>
are.  <br/>
<br/>
Blessed Be,<br/>
