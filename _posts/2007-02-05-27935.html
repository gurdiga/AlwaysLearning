<div id="ygrps-yiv-365273544">The autobiography at the website Dar shared seems to encompass the text <br/>
of &quot;...and the children played&quot;.  I read the book several months ago and <br/>
a few chapters in the center that I skimmed in the website autobiography <br/>
were the same as the book. <br/>
<br/>
I enjoyed the book from an unschooling perspective - I read it on the <br/>
tail end of a financially bleak year in our family so some of it hit a <br/>
bit too close to home for me, but very interesting, regardless.<br/>
<br/>
I borrowed my copy of the book through the library in our new town, but <br/>
I know all libraries aren&#39;t so good at getting out-of-print copies.  I&#39;m <br/>
glad people don&#39;t have to pay $150 to read about Ms Joudry and her <br/>
family&#39;s out-of-the-ordinary experiences.  Thanks for finding the info <br/>
about her family, Dar.<br/>
