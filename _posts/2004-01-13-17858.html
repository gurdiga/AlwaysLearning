<div id="ygrps-yiv-531116209">&quot;The boffer swords are built with pvc water pipe (I don&#39;t know measurements, <br/>
but I&#39;m guesing 3/4&quot;) covered with foam insulation (made for that pipe) and<br/>
 <br/>
then covered with duct tape, and the end padded with more foam and more duct <br/>
tape.   The end of the hilt is taped over so the PVC isn&#39;t dangerous.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ours are with 1/2&quot; pipe, cut to the length of where the childs hand hangs when standing straight. (actually about where their wrist is). Once you wrap it in the pipe insulation (also 1/2&quot;) and duct tape the whole thing really well, it is actually decently sized.<br/>
Also, we just use a piece of the pipe insulation for the cross bar (above the handle) that sticks out about 2&quot; or so on each side and we cap the end of the pvc before wrapping it,just to make it safer.<br/>
<br/>
Jared just had his tooth chipped about an hour ago by a child that doesn&#39;t know the boffer rules very well. There are really GOOD reasons to explain to newcomers about the rules of where you can hit and why (as Sandra was explaining). Whenever we have new kids over, they tend to get a bit carried away at first....I suppose they&#39;ve not had sword play on their regular agenda. sigh.<br/>
