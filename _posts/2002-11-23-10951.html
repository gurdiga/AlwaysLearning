<div id="ygrps-yiv-1303706202">I&#39;m a huge huge culprit of pointing out the beauty of bi-racial <br/>
kids.  They *are* cuter!!!  ;)  Ok I may be partial since mine are <br/>
half white and half Korean but they are cuter :).  And I&#39;m sure some <br/>
people get turned off by me, the gushing white girl.  Especially in <br/>
the grocery store or sompleace when I don&#39;t have my own kids with <br/>
me.  <br/>
<br/>
And people tell me all the time how adorable my kids are.  And I just <br/>
have to agree with them.  The thought that they might be faking it or <br/>
trying to prove something to themselves didn&#39;t occure to me until I <br/>
was on a list talking to another mother with biracial children.<br/>
<br/>
So what is a poor uncultured white girl to do?  I&#39;ve never been the <br/>
victim of out and out racial predjudice before (at least to my <br/>
knowledge) and neither have my children really.  My husband has <br/>
extensivley but it&#39;s still not something I understand.  I find myself <br/>
now *so* sensitive to the subtile things people say that I often <br/>
don&#39;t say anything.<br/>
<br/>
I always wish I could wear a t-shirt that would explain it all.  Then <br/>
I have to ask myself what am I trying to prove?  Maybe I am the <br/>
obnoxious white girl who&#39;s trying to prove she&#39;s not racist to <br/>
herself.  I know I have some racist hangups.  I know this.  I wish I <br/>
didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
So what is the best way?  From people who have biracial families or <br/>
people who are in same sex relationships.  What is the best way for <br/>
me to let you know that I think wht you&#39;re doing is great.  And I <br/>
wish it wasn&#39;t such a big deal and I hope some day we won&#39;t even have <br/>
to think twice about it?<br/>
<br/>
Katie<br/>
<br/>
PS.  Where I live biracial families in my age group are almost the <br/>
norm.  At least it seems that way.  And almost all of my closest <br/>
friends are in biracial marriages.  (and we all have cute kids :) )</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-534348586">We live in an area of town where almost everyone is some shade of brown, tan, <br/>
butterscotch... how ever you want to describe it. Years ago, Santa Fe built <br/>
this area up for the railroad workers. Many houses are built from old box <br/>
cars! Anyway, the people in our neighborhood are mostly Mexican American, <br/>
some White (those who are white are of Russian, German, or Swedish descent, <br/>
one area is called *Little Russia*) some Black, some Native American, mostly <br/>
a mix of everything. Our area is so diverse and beautiful, everything here is <br/>
so unlike the rest of the town where white and black people only live in this <br/>
area or that area. And everything still has a segregated feeling about it, <br/>
even though most will deny it.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are fascinated with their heritage, Most of my family is Swedish, <br/>
Darin is Cherokee and Delaware. I used to have blonde hair (I dye it red) and <br/>
I have green eyes and pale skin, Darin has black hair, beautiful deep blue <br/>
*Cherokee* eyes, and creamy olive skin. My kids will probably have black hair <br/>
by the time they are older, right now Jack&#39;s is a weird shade of silvery <br/>
blonde highlights on top of light brown hair and Moly&#39;s is golden brown, they <br/>
didn&#39;t get Darin&#39;s blue eyes, they got my olive green eyes. Moly is lighter <br/>
skinned like me, but she doesn&#39;t burn, she just turns golden. Jack is darker <br/>
than Darin and in the summer his skin is just gorgeous. <br/>
<br/>
I have found some wonderful books on being biracial, and diversity at our <br/>
library. There was a display up and it came at a time where the kids were <br/>
being especially curious about all the color in their lives. It has really <br/>
helped explain all the shades of people in our neighborhood. I thought I <br/>
would share some that we have read.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We had a lot of this problem with my adopted siblings.<br/>
While living in Hawaii, I got the racial slurs while my sis got ignored, <br/>
because Eskimo looks enough like some of the races over there to get past the <br/>
biggots.<br/>
We ran into &quot;but who is your REAL Mom?&quot; a lot. To which she&#39;d answer that Mom <br/>
WAS her real Mom thank you.<br/>
There was a LOT of ignorance too. If we told the kids that she was adopted <br/>
and Eskimo they teased us and made fun and said we were liars.<br/>
So we came up with a story that they&#39;d buy and leave us alone with.<br/>
Our Dad was Hawaiian, our Mom was Haole (mean word for white people) and the <br/>
twins they had (us) turned out one Hawaiian and one white.<br/>
Crazy! But it worked.<br/>
<br/>
We got a lot of strange looks traveling together as a family, Dad with black <br/>
hair, Mom with blonde, three Asian looking, two brunettes and one blonde <br/>
child.<br/>
Lots of staring, lots of questions and most of the time we just couldn&#39;t <br/>
figure out what the big deal was.<br/>
My biological sisters and I have such different coloring that I&#39;ve been asked <br/>
if I was sure that we had the same parents. <br/>
Can you believe that?  More than once, people have had the gall to ask if we <br/>
were positive that we were blood related, as though our parents had lied all <br/>
these years.<br/>
It&#39;s funny though, because everyone (our mother included) would mix us up <br/>
when talking on the phone, because we sound SO much alike.<br/>
<br/>
Ren<br/>
&quot;The answers aren&#39;t important really...<br/>
What&#39;s important,  is knowing all the questions.&quot;<br/>

misconception led them to treat him in a much gentler, more humane way than <br/>
they would have, had they known he was male from the get-go.  Lots of sweet <br/>
voices and compliments that other little boys around us weren&#39;t getting.  I <br/>
think part of his gentleness today is from the caring complete strangers <br/>
showed him.  Thinking he was a girl, they didn&#39;t expect him to be rough and <br/>
tough, so he never figured out that maybe his gender was supposed to be <br/>
that way.  Sure, there&#39;s probably more to it than just hair, but if those <br/>
of you with lil&#39; boys with long hair want to run an experiment, continue to <br/>
not cut his hair (provided that&#39;s okay with the child) and see if folks <br/>
treat your son more gently and considerately than they do the boys with <br/>
short hair.<br/>
<br/>
(and I&#39;d suggest letting the gender comments roll away harmlessly unless <br/>
the child is annoyed by them.  After all, what&#39;s it matter if a complete <br/>
stranger knows or doesn&#39;t know your kids gender... or even your own <br/>
gender!?!  Think of it as social camouflage or perceptually helping the <br/>
transgendered and intersex (hermaphrodite) community.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-788481434">I want to respond to Kathryn&#39;s note in another way, but this reminded me <br/>
of something that happend with my then 6 year old<br/>
<br/>
Last year at Halloween, a friend of mine was having a party.  She wanted <br/>
any books we had on Mother Goose stories with pictures, as that was her <br/>
theme.  I asked Lexie to go look for all Mother goose type books she had <br/>
and she, of course, asked why.  I told her and she wanted to know if we <br/>
were invited to the party.  I said that no, we were not. Well, why not, <br/>
she asked. I explained that I was sure there were many reasons and that <br/>
not everyone could be invited to every party.  She reminded me that I&#39;ve <br/>
told her not to discuss her birthday parties around those that were not <br/>
invited and that Rita was very rude to not only tell us about a party to <br/>
which we were not invited, but that she was asking our help in the <br/>
planning of the party by asking for books.  I then said that while that <br/>
was true, I knew that Rita knew I was mature enough to handle the <br/>
situation and that I also was pretty sure that children were not <br/>
invited.  I was kinda hemming and hawing.  Lexie replied by telling me <br/>
that she was very mature for her age and that she could behave like an <br/>
adult.  I said I was also sure that the party started very late, too <br/>
late for kids.  She said she stays up late each night (she does, that is <br/>
true).  I finally said that the primary reason was because the party was <br/>
for lesbians, the one night a year Rita had an all girls party.  This <br/>
took the cake for Lexie.  She said that she had already told me she was <br/>
going to be bisexual and that she might only be a lesbian and that she <br/>
needed to have lots of experiences with lots of different people and <br/>
what better way to learn about lesbians and bisexuals then going to a <br/>
party with them.  Lexie has said for the last few years that she is <br/>
going to marry two boys and one girl to have four adults in the family <br/>
so that her kids will always have at least one dad and one mom home with <br/>
with them at any given time.<br/>
<br/>
I told Rita this and I know she told her friends because we went to <br/>
their fourth of July party at the Hollywood Bowl.  They buy a block of <br/>
tickets way in the back, hang Rainbow Coalition flags and USA flags, <br/>
have a huge pot luck, etc.  They all teased us and said we were the <br/>
token gay couple.  But everyone who met Lexie would say to us, looking <br/>
at Rita knowingly, oh this is Lexie. Rita thinks Lexie is the best kid <br/>
on earth...<br/>

&gt; for a few days and she was trying to plan out where he was going to<br/>
&gt; sleep.  She had intended that he would sleep in her room (she had a queen<br/>

&gt; I said with a shrug, &quot;I guess I&#39;m just more comfortable with lesbian <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Not quite what she expected from her old mum. (grin)  Blew her mind.  She<br/>
&gt; chattered about that one to her friends for a few days.  (and yes, she<br/>
&gt; knows I have lesbian friends and transgendered acquaintances, but I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; really stress it much and as she&#39;s never had a romantic interest come<br/>

Tell Lexie she is not the only one.<br/>
<br/>
The kids of my mother&#39;s older brother look more like her than my <br/>
brother and I ever did when living in PR.  We loved them to pieces <br/>
but hated going out with them because people would talk to them and <br/>
then turn to my mom and ask if she was babysitting us.<br/>
<br/>
Even though we are officially &quot;high-yellow&quot;, my brother and I were <br/>
more like a mahogany brown when living in the island. All that <br/>
playing outdoors gave us wonderfully dark tans. Notwithstanding the <br/>
fact that my brother has my mother&#39;s smile and I look like the <br/>
spitting image of her; since she was blonder then and has agathe <br/>
color eyes, people could just not get past the color of our skins.<br/>
<br/>
The reason why I believe that language is a strong marker of how we <br/>
perceive others is due to the many ways I had to deal with it growing <br/>
up.  Since I grew up bilingual, English became the measure for our <br/>
Spanish&#39;s quirks. I remember asking my parents, why is it that in <br/>
English you can say &quot;I am black&quot; but in Spanish I never hear people <br/>
saying that?<br/>
<br/>
In Puerto Rico it is really not kosher to call somebody black. In the <br/>
island when talking about someone black, people refer to them as <br/>
trigueño or trigueña notwithstanding the fact that the words means <br/>
&quot;the color of wheat&quot;. Or, if they want to be poetic, they talk about <br/>
somebody&#39;s &quot;piel canela&quot; (cinnamon skin). In NYC the euphemism is <br/>
moreno or morena, which literally means &quot;brunette&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
So to piss people off I started to use the word negra to describe <br/>
myself. I would piss them off because people with darker skin than <br/>
mine do not hesitate to call themselves white in PR. I do not know at <br/>
what age it started but I distinctly remember answering to people: &quot;I <br/>
am black, she&#39;s white AND she is my mother.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I did not have to add anything to add.<br/>
<br/>
Flash forward to more than 20 years. Evan looks like a little Ricky <br/>
Martín. Aidan, on the other hand, is not dark AT ALL. He has light <br/>
brown hair, dark brown eyes and peachy white skin.<br/>
<br/>
My favorite birracial moment was about a year ago, when I was still <br/>
nursing Aidan. It was around summer because I was massively tanned. <br/>
We were shopping at BJs and he got hungry and cranky. They were <br/>
selling lawn chairs, so I sat down to nurse him (there is like <br/>
nowhere to sit down at BJs). Boy oh boy oh boy. Earlier Mark had had <br/>
one of those, &quot;where&#39;s your family moments&quot; with Evan. Well, there <br/>
was no asking us now. Nursing is not so much of an issue here in NYC <br/>
and environs but a black woman nursing a white child in public is a <br/>
whole other thing. We definitely had a good laugh.<br/>
<br/>
Then there are the semi-horror stories. One day, one of the kids <br/>
threw a tantrum, I can&#39;t remember where. All I know is that he kept <br/>
saying &quot;Mommy, mommy&quot; as in &quot;leave me alone I am pissed at you <br/>
Mommy!&quot; Because I have been referred to as the nanny more times I <br/>
want to count, I can&#39;t tell you how freaked out I was that day. It <br/>
was like, oh boy, now people will think that I am abducting my own <br/>
child. Which they did. If it had not been for Mark, who was in <br/>
another part of the store or whatever the place it was, I would have <br/>
had to go to the police! Can you believe that %$#@! And of course, NO <br/>
ONE APOLOGIZED.<br/>
<br/>
Still, why do I love NYC? It is the by and far the biracial capital <br/>
of the world. No doubt about it!<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>
Liza<br/>

 </span></blockquote>oh man, did I find out this the hard way. I called a student Black once <br/>
and she corrected me quite rudely.  I never made that mistake again. <br/>
 This was in the valley of Alb.  By the river, Sandra.  This was the <br/>
same class that called me a racist.  The principal was called in, by the <br/>
kids (middle school).  They said I liked the white kids more than I <br/>
liked the brown ones. The principal and I looked at the list of kids in <br/>
the class and pointed out there were no white kids in the class.  So <br/>
they said I liked the light skinned hispanics more than the dark ones.   <br/>
I asked him to let me handle it in my own way.  The next day my brother <br/>
Juan happened to come by at that time period, and I introduced him.  Oh <br/>
by the way class, this is my LITTLE brother.  Juan stands well over 6 <br/>
feet, is as wide as a fridge and is dark brown with long black hair.  He <br/>
is probably half Hispanic/half pueblo but he calls himself an Indian. <br/>
 When we go to pueblos or to Santa fe, people stop him and ask him if <br/>
they can take his picture.  I always tell him he should charge money, <br/>
but he doesn&#39;t.  He just laughs.  Anyway, he shows up to give me <br/>
something, just by accident, at the same time as this class.  The day <br/>
after that my boyfriend, soon to be my husband, stopped by to give me <br/>
lunch money.  Just by luck, it was during that same class period.  <br/>
<br/>
I never heard another word about me liking the light skinned hispanics <br/>
more than the dark ones.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I do not know at what age it started but I distinctly remember <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Flash forward to more than 20 years. Evan looks like a little Ricky <br/>
&gt; Martín. Aidan, on the other hand, is not dark AT ALL. He has light <br/>
&gt; brown hair, dark brown eyes and peachy white skin.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My favorite birracial moment was about a year ago, when I was still <br/>
&gt; nursing Aidan. It was around summer because I was massively tanned. We <br/>
&gt; were shopping at BJs and he got hungry and cranky. They were selling <br/>
&gt; lawn chairs, so I sat down to nurse him (there is like nowhere to sit <br/>
&gt; down at BJs). Boy oh boy oh boy. Earlier Mark had had one of those, <br/>
&gt; &quot;where&#39;s your family moments&quot; with Evan. Well, there was no asking us <br/>
&gt; now. Nursing is not so much of an issue here in NYC and environs but a <br/>
&gt; black woman nursing a white child in public is a whole other thing.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Or a white woman nursing a black child.  But it was good, it was <br/>
something I could do to proove she was my child.  Why would I need to do <br/>
that, i can hear people asking.  Well, for those folks who think I&#39;m <br/>
just the foster mom.  Read a story about a woman with black kids in the <br/>
store.  The toddler got away for a minute, and was picked up by an <br/>
employee.  The woman had to prove the child was hers.  What way to do <br/>
that?  She didn&#39;t have a picture of her child with her, the child wasn&#39;t <br/>
talking a lot yet, what&#39;s a mom to do.  It was one reason, not a big <br/>
one, but one reason why I continued to nurse Lexie.  Another story I <br/>
heard was a black mom who had a very pale baby.  Baby went to nursery in <br/>
the hospital so mom could sleep and the nursing shift changed.  New <br/>
nurse saw baby wake up and went to take baby to mother but when she saw <br/>
sleeping mom was black and baby was not, she decided there had been a <br/>
mix up.  Hours later it was resolved, but meanwhile the mom wasn&#39;t <br/>
allowed to hold her baby.  This was before all the banding, etc. today <br/>
but still.  I kept my babies with me 100% of the time in the hospital, <br/>
just for this reason.  well, for other reasons too, but for this one as <br/>
well.  <br/>
<br/>
I love your stories, Liza. Thank you<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Then there are the semi-horror stories. One day, one of the kids threw <br/>
&gt; a tantrum, I can&#39;t remember where. All I know is that he kept saying <br/>
&gt; &quot;Mommy, mommy&quot; as in &quot;leave me alone I am pissed at you Mommy!&quot; <br/>
&gt; Because I have been referred to as the nanny more times I want to <br/>
&gt; count, I can&#39;t tell you how freaked out I was that day. It was like, <br/>
&gt; oh boy, now people will think that I am abducting my own child. Which <br/>
&gt; they did. If it had not been for Mark, who was in another part of the <br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I learned an interesting parenting thing from a good friend of mine <br/>
&gt; about the<br/>
&gt; assumptions we make.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is a straight married woman who was talking about her kids. She<br/>
&gt; mentioned she was gently teasing her then 15 year old daughter about a <br/>
&gt; couple<br/>
&gt; of kids she had met over a weekend, a boy and a girl. She asked about the<br/>
&gt; boy, &quot;So do you LIKE him?&quot; THEN she asked if she LIKED the girl.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was flabbergasted! ( I just love that word). She had an awareness <br/>
&gt; that her<br/>
&gt; daughter just might not be straight, and without even really trying,<br/>
&gt; communicated to her that it was okay and natural, in the light teasing <br/>
&gt; way<br/>
&gt; that parents do with their kids sometimes. (This kid is one who was <br/>
&gt; fine with<br/>
&gt; her mom asking about this kind of thing.) Now, most of our kids are <br/>
&gt; likely to<br/>
&gt; be straight. BUT even very enlightened parents often talk to their <br/>
&gt; kids in<br/>
&gt; ways that would make it hard for a questioning kid to think it was okay.<br/>
&gt; Kathleen gracefully, in a normal situation, did that (and does <br/>
&gt; consistently.)<br/>
&gt; Until she told me that story (and, even more amazingly, it was not to <br/>
&gt; show<br/>
&gt; me how enlightenened she was. She was genuinely startled when I <br/>
&gt; complimented<br/>
&gt; her on that aspect of it.), it hadn&#39;t occurred to me how much &gt;I&lt; took <br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; granted that Julian would probably be straight. I think about the <br/>
&gt; messages I<br/>
&gt; give much more now.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Is this as clear as mud? I&#39;m still a little addled.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Very clear.  I think about this a lot in relationship to my girl scout <br/>
troop.  Statistically one or two of them will be gay.  What can I do to <br/>
help them have a better time with their, oh, I&#39;m not sure of the words <br/>
here... realization of their sexuality.  Girl Scouts motto is &quot;Where <br/>
girls grow strong.&quot;  I take that seriously.  I want my girls to be <br/>
strong girls, sure of themselves and their value.  At least as much as I <br/>
can do as a leader.  <br/>

these days than to say &quot;pukka.&quot;  I guess that has colonial overtones which<br/>
would make *it* racist, as well as out of fashion (and easy to mis-hear as<br/>
something else!).<br/>
<br/>
Most dictionaries give &quot;kosher&quot; a secondary meaning -- legitimate, proper,<br/>
geniuine -- while that is the primary meaning of &quot;pukka.&quot;  (And I&#39;ve never<br/>
before heard &quot;n-rigged&quot; until this discussion; my family always said<br/>
&quot;jerry-rigged,&quot; being native Californian, Anglo-American and no fans of<br/>
those Nazi Germans. ;-)<br/>

&lt;&lt;  In new mexico a rude term for white person is <br/>
<br/>
wetta or jueta.  No one here in California has ever heard that term.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
huera<br/>
But it&#39;s not just anyone white.  It&#39;s specifically a blondie--female.<br/>
My friend Anne&#39;s relatives on one side are Mexican and live near Las Cruces <br/>
(near El Paso), and she went to a major birthday of one of the elderly <br/>
guys--her great uncle or some such.  She&#39;s really blonde and blue-eyed.  She <br/>
said every single one of the older women gushed &quot;que bonita huera!&quot; about her <br/>
at least once.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been watching the Lord of the Rings DVDs (the new set of four with the <br/>
extended version and HOURS and hours of background.    WETA workshop, <br/>
pronounced by kiwis, sounds exactly like huera pronounced in Northern New <br/>
Mexico and it was jarring the first ten times I heard it.<br/>
<br/>
I was never a huera myself, so I didn&#39;t take it personally. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
And I don&#39;t usually hear huera as an insult, but as just a simple descriptor.<br/>
<br/>
In college I had a roommate from St. Louis who had requested a roommate from <br/>
New Mexico because she was studying Spanish and intended that as a major.  <br/>
She forgot to specify &quot;Spanish-speaking.&quot;  I was nearly worthless.  But I <br/>
could spot errors in her read-alouds sometimes.  Not in verbs, because I <br/>
never knew with verb tenses. But in nouns and adjectives and lilt I could <br/>
sometimes help her tweak.  She was very white-skinned and red-headed, and <br/>
said &quot;quater&quot; for quarter.  Had that kind of broad &quot;a&quot; that only gets worse <br/>
to Chicago where it can&#39;t get any worse.  It sticks out in Albuquerque, <br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
She got a boyfriend named Bernardo Martinez, from Mora.  He was heavy into <br/>
the Brown Berets, in the early 70&#39;s, Chicano Power, and all that.  They were <br/>
NOT happy with him for having a red-headed anglo girlfriend.   <br/>
<br/>
Mora&#39;s over the mountains from Espanola; in the neighborhood of Las Vegas, <br/>
NM.  No truck between them at all; few people have relatives between those <br/>
places.  But the type of place he had grown up wasn&#39;t at all foreign to me, <br/>
nor mine to him.   His mom was a curandera.  She had never been married.  <br/>
They still lived in one of the adobe houses around what would have been at <br/>
one time a plaza, and then was the parking lot in front of the church.  So <br/>
some people didn&#39;t like her for being a witch (as it were; not all anglo <br/>
forms of &#39;witch&#39;) and some thought she was great because she knew herbal <br/>
cures and midwifery.<br/>
<br/>
So, back at UNM, Bernardo hung around our dorm room a lot.  He was pretty <br/>
freaked out by being in Albuquerque.  So was I, but Bernardo worse.   <br/>
<br/>
One day after we&#39;d known each other for a few months and he was confiding in <br/>
me some of the things his radical chicano cohorts had said about Liz, the <br/>
roommate, he happened to think to ask me what my last name was.<br/>
<br/>
Adams.<br/>
<br/>
He looked at me funny and said &quot;What&#39;s your mother&#39;s maiden name?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hathcock.  <br/>
<br/>
He just blanched.  &quot;You&#39;re gringa?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I got big eyes, and said &quot;I thought you knew that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It was a heck of a moment.  He sat there and thought some palpable, visible <br/>
thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
He was basing his political and social life on some big prejudices, but he <br/>
had assumed because I had dark hair and dark eyes and was from Espanola that <br/>
I was a Trujillo or a Sanchez or something.  <br/>
<br/>
Within a few months I started a years long relationship with Devender Singh, <br/>
who was darker than Bernardo, but from New Jersey (and before that, Toronto, <br/>
Bombay, and Delhi).<br/>
<br/>
None of that was unusual for New Mexico, and Jon Tsosie came and visited us <br/>
all every few weeks, and my former boyfriend Joseph Garcia hung around a fair <br/>
amount too that year.  (Guitar players, Jon and Joseph both &lt;g&gt;.  Dev played <br/>
tabla; my only drummer ever, but he also played guitar, just not performance <br/>
quality.  He did get us back stage at the Ravi Shankar concert at Popejoy.)<br/>
<br/>
We were reading Lord of the Rings in that season.  Dev and I were going to <br/>
get married, have four children, and name the first boy Peregrine and call <br/>
him Pippin.  <br/>
<br/>
Dev called me last June.  Jon Tsosie died of the effects of alcoholism at 35; <br/>
I went to his funeral, and he was buried in a blanket outside Santa Clara <br/>
church after a mass at which a Franciscan priest shamed everyone in his <br/>
family for being bad Catholics; Joseph&#39;s living in Southern California, but <br/>
we&#39;ve lost contact; I keep thinking Liz or Bernardo will find me someday.  <br/>
They&#39;re probably still around close.  She was teaching bi-lingual classes for <br/>
Albuquerque public schools last I knew.  Bernardo wanted to become a bank <br/>
robber.  I used to listen carefully to every bank robbery story. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-460321308">Okay, when you go out to eat or to a movie, have you ever &#39;gone dutch&#39;?<br/>
<br/>
That happens to be a (racist) slur against the Dutch people instigated by <br/>
the Spanish when the Dutch were economically powerful and the Spanish <br/>
wanted in on some of it.  Mid 1700&#39;s I think it was, maybe earlier.  Not <br/>
good with dates.  The Dutch were seriously and internationally maligned, <br/>
libel&#39;d and smeared for quite some time as penny-pinchers and dishonest <br/>
merchants - and all because they were a stronger economic power than the <br/>
Spaniards.<br/>
<br/>
Does it really rankle me when people say they&#39;re &#39;going dutch&#39;?  Sure and <br/>
Not really.  I know to most folks, it&#39;s just a phrase that doesn&#39;t even <br/>
relate to their idea of what being dutch is.  They don&#39;t know the history, <br/>
for gods sake, they don&#39;t even usually know US history, much less anything <br/>
international.  Besides, if it ever gets to me, I can always counter with, <br/>
&quot;If you&#39;re not Dutch, you&#39;re not much!&quot;  (grin)<br/>
<br/>
Racism isn&#39;t always about coffee or cream.<br/>
(and I&#39;m not white, either.  I&#39;m more a wrinkly peachy color with little <br/>

if the hot and cold water are reversed, I&#39;ve heard that referred to as &quot;a <br/>

&gt; We were shopping at BJs and he got hungry and cranky. They were <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Lansing Michigan, were I live is very bi-racial as well. At least <br/>
here on the south side. I wouldn&#39;t even blink to see a bi-racial <br/>
family. If I saw two woman on the bus of different race with a child <br/>
sitting between them (and I have) I would never asume the one <br/>
who &quot;matched&quot; was the mother. :-) of course thats just me, but its <br/>
pretty well blended here. To see two people of the same race together <br/>
(as in  a couple) is more out of the ordinary! I love it, diversity <br/>
is beautiful. On the other hand Detroit is one of the most segregated <br/>
citys in the country but I&#39;ve heard that they are working on that. I <br/>
don&#39;t know what it is, but whenever I see an interracial couple <br/>
(sometimes I dont&#39; even notice, but when I do--) it makes me smile.<br/>
