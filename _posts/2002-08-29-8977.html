<div id="ygrps-yiv-1326432714">I hadn&#39;t thought of this song for years.  It was a favorite of a high school <br/>
friend, Jon Tsosie, who had a CF Martin guitar when we were just fifteen.   I <br/>
think it&#39;s one of the best pieces of poetry Paul Simon every wrote.   I told <br/>
Holly &quot;This is a pretty song.  It&#39;s very poetic,&quot; and she said &quot;What&#39;s <br/>
poetic?&quot; so I used the second verse as an example and she got it.  (Check <br/>
that off the vocabulary and literary checklist, because she REALLY got it.)<br/>
<br/>
As I listened with Holly I heard it as not the romantic youthful love song it <br/>
was to me when I was a teenager, but as the connectedness between any people <br/>
who really care about one another, parent and child included.  And of how <br/>
having a child changes the things we once held as true.<br/>
<br/>
So maybe this should go on the list of songs to inspire unschoolers too.  Not <br/>
quite an anthem, but maybe a lullaby.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Kathy&#39;s Song<br/>
<br/>
I hear the drizzle of the rain<br/>
Like a memory it falls<br/>
Soft and warm continuing<br/>
Tapping on my roof and walls.<br/>
<br/>
And from the shelter of my mind<br/>
Through the window of my eyes<br/>
I gaze beyond the rain-drenched streets<br/>
To England where my heart lies.<br/>
<br/>
My mind&#39;s distracted and diffused<br/>
My thoughts are many miles away<br/>
They lie with you when you&#39;re asleep<br/>
And kiss you when you start your day.<br/>
<br/>
And as a song I was writing is left undone<br/>
I don&#39;t know why I spend my time<br/>
Writing songs I can&#39;t believe<br/>
With words that tear and strain to rhyme.<br/>
<br/>
And so you see I have come to doubt<br/>
All that I once held as true<br/>
I stand alone without beliefs<br/>
The only truth I know is you.<br/>
<br/>
And as I watch the drops of rain<br/>
Weave their weary paths and die<br/>
I know that I am like the rain<br/>
There but for the grace of you go I.</div>
