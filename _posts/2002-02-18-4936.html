<div id="ygrps-yiv-1523007765">I think I have found two good examples of unschooling in everyday <br/>
kids television shows.  I accept that I may be wrong here as I havn&#39;t <br/>
seen every episode of either of these shows so if I&#39;m wrong please <br/>
correct me.  And if you have more examples let me know.<br/>
<br/>
George Shrinks: A saturday morning cartoon on our local PBS station.  <br/>
I think it&#39;s based on a book series.  The guy (George) is 3 inches <br/>
tall and lives with his mom, dad, and his &#39;little&#39; brother Junior.  <br/>
As far as I can see he doesn&#39;t go to school.  And he&#39;s extremly <br/>
bright.  His parent&#39;s are both VERY cool.  :)  His mom is an artist <br/>
and his father is a musician/inventor.  I love their parenting <br/>
style :)  I&#39;ve never seen an episode where they tried to teach the <br/>
kids anything they didn&#39;t want to know.  And the kids are both very <br/>
inquisitive.  OK I understand that these aren&#39;t real people :)  I <br/>
know it&#39;s not even based on real people but it&#39;s good!!  LOL<br/>
<br/>
The other one I was thinking of is Pokemon.  Does anyone know if I&#39;m <br/>
wrong here??  Seems to me that Ash is off on his own adventure and <br/>
learning tons of stuff.  I think if this were real life people would <br/>
be very worried about the fact that all he&#39;s interested in is pokemon <br/>
but think of all of the life experience he&#39;s gaining.  And what a <br/>
great mom he has to let him go and do all that :)  Maybe he did go to <br/>
school.  I don&#39;t know.  If so I didn&#39;t see that episode.  Anyone <br/>
else??<br/>
