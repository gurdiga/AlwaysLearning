Delivery Service and My Neighbor Totoro.  Both are Japanese with <br/>
American voices dubbed over and both show how girls can take care of <br/>

rather than making things up... Another part I liked.   My sons ages <br/>
3 and 7 (well close enough) love them and I imagine Zak will watch <br/>
them for a while.  <br/>

the video shop. We&#39;ll have to check out the other one.<br/>

People recommended these for a long time before I got them for Holly in <br/>
December.  She LOVES them.  I really like the art.  She likes the music.  <br/>
(All of it, but really likes the music and wishes there was more.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Has anyone found Castle in the Air?  That&#39;s the anime video in the<br/>
commercials before the Kiki video starts.  My kids have asked for it<br/>
and I can&#39;t find it.<br/>
<br/>
Alex loves that video.  He acts it out with various toys as the blimp,<br/>
the clock tower, Tombo and the police car.  He made a Lego clocktower<br/>
yesterday. I&#39;m making him a quilt with his favorite vehicles on it.   <br/>
It has to have a blimp and a clocktower!  If you ask a 4 year old for <br/>
design input, expect challenges!&lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Disney is sitting on it for some reason. They had planned to release it<br/>
directly to video but are now considering releasing it to the theaters.<br/>
Disney signed a deal to dub and subtitle and distribute nearly all of Hiyao<br/>
Miyazaki&#39;s (the animator/director/writer) films. Some of his movies have<br/>
been the highest grossing films of all time in Japan and I suspect Disney<br/>
isn&#39;t confident that they will be as popular in the US but is afraid if they<br/>
release them to video that they&#39;ll have blown a big money making<br/>
opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
I think Disney didn&#39;t know what to do with his previous film, Princess<br/>
Mononoke, because it wasn&#39;t for kids and American teens and adults just<br/>
aren&#39;t used to more mature subjects in animation so it didn&#39;t do much for<br/>
their confidence in the potential of the American audience for his films.<br/>
(It&#39;s a wonderful film by the way. It makes anything done by Disney look<br/>
like pablum.) *Maybe*, *hopefully* after they release his newest, Spirited<br/>
Away, they&#39;ll get more confident.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s an incredibly thorough fan website for Miyazaki&#39;s films:<br/>

In fact if you click on Search you can type in script and get a list of all<br/>
the Miyazaki scripts available for download.<br/>

many years ago about this deal and wondered why we couldn&#39;t get the<br/>
other videos....<br/>
