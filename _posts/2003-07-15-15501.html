<div id="ygrps-yiv-684775609">... that husbands always forget to tell you their inlaws are coming over on<br/>
the very day that the cat litter box is starting to get pretty ripe and the<br/>
children are still in their underwear at 1 p.m. and it&#39;s the day that you<br/>
swore you were going to get caught up on the housework but haven&#39;t yet and<br/>
of course two days ago your children were given 17,456,732 old and wonderful<br/>
Barbie outfits which are strewn across the length and breadth of your living<br/>
room like there was some kind of spectacular Mattel-sponsored orgy held<br/>
there just the night before?<br/>
<br/>
I just want to know why. Three days ago, the house was actually clean, and I<br/>
do believe I had even brushed my teeth before 11 a.m. Why not then?<br/>

father but my step-mother-in-law I can definitely do without these days.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1371033067">LOL Pam, Perhaps so we can breath deeply and get Zen<br/>
with life as it is.. Today Culligan man shows up to<br/>
test water and set up system so our water does not<br/>
stink.. I have six different art and science projects<br/>
going on in the middle of the living room/ dining<br/>
area. I have four bags of clothes by the front door,<br/>
not all in the bags, to go to Good Will. The fish tank<br/>
has peanut butter and jelly all over the outside<br/>
thanks to the three year old and brunch dishes are in<br/>
the midst of being done.. I did my deepest breath and<br/>
asked if he would mind explaining to all of us the<br/>
tests he was doing and what everything meant. I got to<br/>
practice acting as if my house was looking good.I hate<br/>
that for me sometimes it is a reflection on who I am..<br/>
It is my house.. <br/>
Did you thank hubby later??? <br/>
