<div id="ygrps-yiv-1052037116">Speaking of unschooling as a spiritual endeavor, or a philosophy of life,<br/>
I sometimes wonder if anyone has a personal philosophy of life anymore.  <br/>
What I see is a socialized philosophy of conformity.  <br/>
<br/>
There are two women I am acquainted with who have children on Ritalin<br/>
drugs.  One of these women, has all three of her children on Ritalin<br/>
(sp?). How does this happen?   Her daughter is one of Dylan&#39;s friends. <br/>
When she was five or six and in kindergarten the teacher couldn&#39;t stand<br/>
her and made her sit in the hall.   One teacher&#39;s aid I know told me she<br/>
spent the entire year in the hall.  So, she&#39;s almost twelve now and has<br/>
been on medication for half her life, at least.  The first time she came<br/>
to our house without her mom, I had cookies on the table and she asked if<br/>
she could have one.  I told her yes.  Could she have two?  Three?  I told<br/>
her to eat them all if she thought her stomach could take it.  She asked<br/>
to play the piano, to look at the violin, to go into my room, to count<br/>
the money in my piggy bank, to cook dinner for us.  There wasn&#39;t anything<br/>
she couldn&#39;t do here and she chose to sit and draw with Dylan and watch a<br/>
movie. (And cook dinner, which was delicious)  Her mom was astounded when<br/>
she came to get her, to find her &quot;troubled&quot; daughter happily quiet and<br/>
calm.   This scenario has repeated now several times and her mom  asked <br/>
last Wednesday if I would  &quot;homeschool&quot; her next year.   What is this?  <br/>
<br/>
The other mom has let the school tell her exactly how to raise her son<br/>
and exactly what they expect and she has complied in her own words<br/>
&quot;sometimes against&quot; her better judgement.  WHY?      <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday while setting up for the library book sale I met a lovely<br/>
little girl .  Two women there, the foster mom and her friend were<br/>
keeping track of this little person.  She was wonderful, singing, playing<br/>
in boxes, talking nicely with all the helpers.  The commandants &quot;had to&quot;<br/>
correct her,  frequently.  I said, as sweetly as I could, that she wasn&#39;t<br/>
a mistake, and therefor needed no correction and they all laughed and<br/>
said how difficult it is to discipline her because she&#39;s so cute, blah,<br/>
blah.  Discipline?   She&#39;s TWO!  They never missed an opportunity to stop<br/>
her from having fun and that&#39;s all she was doing, because she  wasn&#39;t<br/>
wildly running about risking injury or destruction of property.   One of<br/>
these women know&#39;s Dylan and in a discussion about &quot;discipline&quot; I told<br/>
them he had never been spanked or time outed (?) or otherwise &quot;punished&quot;<br/>
and I told them that I really believed  &quot;bad&quot; behavior in a child wasn&#39;t<br/>
really bad behavior, but bad parenting.  When we fail to meet their needs<br/>
we don&#39;t have the right to punish them for getting frustrated.  It won&#39;t<br/>
make any difference in their thinking, but they asked.<br/>
<br/>
So I think it has to do with what adults see children as.  Are they<br/>
beings who deserve respect and dignity or are they empty vessels,<br/>
essentially worthless unless they are controlled by us and filled with<br/>
our goodness and rightness and knowledge.   It&#39;s more than trusting that<br/>
they will learn, it&#39;s knowing that they are people.  How can you do the<br/>
first, if you don&#39;t really believe the second? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m depressed just thinking about the lives of these children.   I&#39;m<br/>
offended that big people can drug and hit little people and it&#39;s lawful<br/>
and acceptable.  I amazed that grown mothers of precious children don&#39;t<br/>
believe they are perfect, and right and more important than any school<br/>
system or any order from God.  <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve never seen or heard that put so simply and plainly.<br/>
I need to remember to use that.  I have a couple of fantasy targets, but the <br/>
best is past the point of helping--her kids are 17 and 14 and quite lost <br/>
causes.  But they used to be the best candidates for unschooling I had ever <br/>
seen.  I practically BEGGED their mom to keep them home when Kirby was little <br/>
and hers were too, but she said she probably would after elementary.  Too <br/>
late.  They didn&#39;t love her or home anymore after elementary, and their dad <br/>
committed suicide.  I think he killed himself because the house was *SO* <br/>
negative, so cynical, so filled with pessimism, that school was a joyous hap<br/>
py escape.  And he was working from home!  (making big bucks as a computer <br/>
consultant, but still...)  It didn&#39;t have to be that way.<br/>
<br/>
She loves cynicism more than her children.  She will argue long and hard to <br/>
defend her cynicism.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Deb L, what was your religious upbringing?  Please answer that, at least on <br/>
the side, because I truly personally want to know.   <br/>
<br/>
The two choices you have gven above are both wrong, per Christianity.  The <br/>
overwhelming belief of people in the English speaking world, and if not of <br/>
thiions is this:   Children are born sinful, and willful, and must have that <br/>
trained out of them.  They must have their wills broken.  They must learn to <br/>
obey, and not to act on their own (sinful) desires.<br/>
<br/>
Church has taught that for a long time. <br/>
Universities have taught (falsely, but maybe hopefully) that there are no <br/>
human instincts.  They have all been extinguished.  Humans can only learn <br/>
from the writings of humans who came before them.   If pressed, they would <br/>
probably find their philosophy meeting the church and it would come down to <br/>
what SEEMS like instinct is a selfish desire and will lead to sin.<br/>
<br/>
So if you say &quot;What!?  No instinct?   No adrenaline, desire for revenge, no <br/>
sexual urges??&quot;   All sins.  Anger is a sin, in the Bible.    What about <br/>
mothering instincts, though?  The desire to carry a child around and sleep <br/>
with him?  SIN SIN SIN.<br/>
<br/>
It would be nice if I were just talking about a hundred years ago, but I&#39;m <br/>
talking about now, in your own town, wherever you are, there are people who <br/>
believe those things STRONGLY.<br/>
<br/>
So neither the perfection nor the empty-vessel model, although they&#39;ve both <br/>
been discussed by a few people for generations, can overcome the born-in-sin <br/>
model.<br/>
<br/>
At birth a child inherits the sin of Adam.  Satan has an advantage in the <br/>
fight for his soul, and so the parents have to work HARD to bring the child <br/>
into the fold by the time he is old enough to decide whether to be a good <br/>
Christian or not (the age of accountability), and if the child isn&#39;t quite <br/>
trained by that time (age estimates vary from nine to fourteen or so on that, <br/>
and judging by the ages Baptist kids make their professions of faith if <br/>
they&#39;re immersed in the church and haven&#39;t been out being tempted by sin), <br/>
his soul could be lost BECAUSE of....   bad parenting.<br/>
<br/>
So we&#39;re full circle.  If the people taking care of that two year old girl <br/>
believe her eternal soul is in their control and she is just being willful <br/>
and sinful, they WERE being &quot;good parents&quot; to try to make her do what adults <br/>
want done.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a huge, gigantic, continent-sized iceberg of a problem.<br/>
And what&#39;s juxtaposed right over it is the Christian Homeschooling Movement.  <br/>
HSLDA and all their associates.  The Southern Baptist Convention.  They don&#39;t <br/>
consider their beliefs &quot;a philosophy.&quot;  They consider them the plainly <br/>
visible word of a vengeful God.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Are they<br/>
beings who deserve respect and dignity or are they empty vessels,<br/>
essentially worthless unless they are controlled by us and filled with<br/>
our goodness and rightness and knowledge. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
For me, a former Baptist who made a profession of faith at ten and was <br/>
baptized on Easter Sunday (I shared that story with Holly this year, who is <br/>
ten and doesn&#39;t believe in God following her own questioning and inquiries), <br/>
I believe they are beings who are eager to fill themselves up with our <br/>
goodness and rightness and knowledge.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This discussion is very interesting to me. I used to be a cynical, often <br/>
depressed, angry person at home. I couldn&#39;t understand why my daughter wasn&#39;t <br/>
&quot;good&quot; or &quot;normal&quot;, and tried to discipline her to prove i wasn&#39;t a BAD <br/>
parent. I found the Lord in February 2000. I was baptised Catholic as an <br/>
infant, but had no churching growing up. I had a distaste for anything <br/>
remotely religious, couldn&#39;t read or listen to anything that was pushing the <br/>
bible. Then one day God moved in me. I have been a member of a Baptist church <br/>
for over 2 years now. I have never seen the vengeful God represented, but a <br/>
loving and forgiving God. I don&#39;t believe in a religion, I believe in a <br/>
RELATIONSHIP, religion is often the wrong way to go about it.  I believe <br/>
children have innocence, and free wills. I believe I model my life for my <br/>
children, and if the fruit they see is what matters to them, they will want <br/>
what I have. But they are free to choose whatever philosophy they feel is <br/>
right. If i want to &quot;win&quot; my children to Christ, then I better make a life a <br/>
powerful witness.  My oldest almost 10yo daughter professed her faith not <br/>
long after I did, when she was 7. I wasn&#39;t sure if she had the <br/>
&quot;accountability&quot; or understanding, that maybe she was just following my <br/>
example. So we have not yet discussed baptism, and she says she knew Jesus <br/>
was real before I met him, before she knew His name. She leaned on Him when <br/>
Mommy used to have rage and resentment and when I thought my child was doing <br/>
things intentionally to get me mad. Boy have I come a long way. I think it <br/>
was ingrained in me from the (lack of) parenting skills my father had. But <br/>
God is good, faithful and very forgiving. He has led me to learn why I acted <br/>
the way I did, what I can do daily to change and get better, and led me to <br/>
homeschooling, unschooling, rebonding with my baby whom I was disconnected <br/>
from for so long, because I was measured based on her public behavior.  I <br/>
have a very shameful history of poor parent conduct, desperate at times, and <br/>
I daily have to wonder what I am accountable for in my daughters behavior and <br/>
who she is due to the pain I subjected her to. I always knew I loved her, and <br/>
thought that was enough, but one day the question occured to me does she know <br/>
i love her, beyond a shadow of a doubt. I am so thankful to be where we are <br/>
now, growing and loving and learning together, and all hope is not lost. <br/>
Ironically, I was trying to train her and break her will before I found the <br/>
Lord, and I don&#39;t feel that is the way He has led me since. He taught me to <br/>
love her and accept her, nurture her and treasure her, the way He does me, <br/>
His child. I believe he has shown me to trust my instincts that were <br/>
previously mostly ignored, trying to trust &quot;experts&quot; that knew better than <br/>
me. I wished I had coslept and carried my 10yo dd, the bond was being severed <br/>
as early as my practice of &quot;separation parenting&quot;, which is the societal norm <br/>
and direct opposite of attachment parenting that I practice with my <br/>
subsequent children. If I come across any Southern Baptists or Christians who <br/>
believe the way you portray, I would pray for them and not listen to them for <br/>
a minute. It is also ironic that I am a homeschooler and Christian, I am not <br/>
a homeschooler because it&#39;s the Christian thing to do, I am an unschooler <br/>
because I am led to believe it is the parenting thing to do, I just happen to <br/>
be a Christian. I have met some Christian homeschoolers, and joined a <br/>
Christian group, but I am sure I am not like many of them!<br/>
<br/>
I love this group and enjoy learning not only about unschooling, but learning <br/>
so much about myself from the reflection here. Thanks, I am grateful for all <br/>
of you! <br/>

Richard Prystosky (whose mother was Jewish, and grandmothers on all sides, <br/>

Question.&quot;   What it was really about was how the way in which we were raised <br/>
affects the way we see and treat our children, and what we can do to change <br/>

overcome an ignorant Christian upbringing by acting more like Jewish families <br/>

<br/>
I would say no, I&#39;ll keep her during the day for money, though, and I&#39;ll help <br/>
you homeschool her.  If most of her learning happens at my house, great, but <br/>
it won&#39;t ALL happen at my house!  Or charge her even more, tell her you&#39;re <br/>
homeschooling her, then you can &quot;give her homework&quot; (which would be <br/>
unschooling directives not to be overshadowed by any nasty schoolwork &lt;g&gt;) <br/>
and soon the mom would understand unschooling AND see that giving you cash to <br/>
do it is goofy. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Another concern would be crowding your own family with a commitment to <br/>
another child, so the money would have to be real and not token.<br/>
<br/>
A friend (not much of a friend anymore) used to give me $10 a day to keep her <br/>
kids for free.  I volunteered, sometimes for a week or two at a time, when <br/>
the mom had to work and the dad wasn&#39;t around.  I&#39;d offer to do it for <br/>
nothing, and she would give me $50 a week or $10 a day.  That was pretty <br/>
irritating, because for $10 I couldn&#39;t even take her two and my three for a <br/>
Happy Meal.  <br/>

an insanely complex task that even experts have problems handling it. It<br/>
seems as daunting as returning 3 Mars astronauts to Earth without training<br/>
or expert to help you. So many parents are pretty eager to have anyone who<br/>
seems better than they are take over because their children&#39;s futures&#39; are<br/>
at stake.<br/>

I am with you.  I am a Christian too.  I find that I am a way more relaxed homeschooler <br/>
than many since I move from NC to Michigan.  Homeschooling is different here than <br/>
there.  There are many who are more relaxed in NC than here in MI.  I can&#39;t quite call <br/>
myself an unschooler, but am relaxed.  I love the time that homeschooling gives me <br/>
with my two girls.  <br/>

&gt; This discussion is very interesting to me. I used to be a cynical, <br/>
&gt; often <br/>
&gt; depressed, angry person at home. I couldn&#39;t understand why my <br/>
&gt; daughter wasn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; &quot;good&quot; or &quot;normal&quot;, and tried to discipline her to prove i wasn&#39;t a <br/>
&gt; BAD <br/>
&gt; parent. I found the Lord in February 2000. I was baptised Catholic as <br/>
&gt; an <br/>
&gt; infant, but had no churching growing up. I had a distaste for <br/>
&gt; anything <br/>
&gt; remotely religious, couldn&#39;t read or listen to anything that was <br/>
&gt; pushing the <br/>
&gt; bible. Then one day God moved in me. I have been a member of a <br/>
&gt; Baptist church <br/>
&gt; for over 2 years now. I have never seen the vengeful God represented, <br/>
&gt; but a <br/>
&gt; loving and forgiving God. I don&#39;t believe in a religion, I believe in <br/>
&gt; a <br/>
&gt; RELATIONSHIP, religion is often the wrong way to go about it. I <br/>
&gt; believe <br/>
&gt; children have innocence, and free wills. I believe I model my life <br/>
&gt; for my <br/>
&gt; children, and if the fruit they see is what matters to them, they <br/>
&gt; will want <br/>
&gt; what I have. But they are free to choose whatever philosophy they <br/>
&gt; feel is <br/>
&gt; right. If i want to &quot;win&quot; my children to Christ, then I better make a <br/>
&gt; life a <br/>
&gt; powerful witness. My oldest almost 10yo daughter professed her faith <br/>
&gt; not <br/>
&gt; long after I did, when she was 7. I wasn&#39;t sure if she had the <br/>
&gt; &quot;accountability&quot; or understanding, that maybe she was just following <br/>
&gt; my <br/>
&gt; example. So we have not yet discussed baptism, and she says she knew <br/>
&gt; Jesus <br/>
&gt; was real before I met him, before she knew His name. She leaned on <br/>
&gt; Him when <br/>
&gt; Mommy used to have rage and resentment and when I thought my child <br/>
&gt; was doing <br/>
&gt; things intentionally to get me mad. Boy have I come a long way. I <br/>
&gt; think it <br/>
&gt; was ingrained in me from the (lack of) parenting skills my father <br/>
&gt; had. But <br/>
&gt; God is good, faithful and very forgiving. He has led me to learn why <br/>
&gt; I acted <br/>
&gt; the way I did, what I can do daily to change and get better, and led <br/>
&gt; me to <br/>
&gt; homeschooling, unschooling, rebonding with my baby whom I was <br/>
&gt; disconnected <br/>
&gt; from for so long, because I was measured based on her public <br/>
&gt; behavior. I <br/>
&gt; have a very shameful history of poor parent conduct, desperate at <br/>
&gt; times, and <br/>
&gt; I daily have to wonder what I am accountable for in my daughters <br/>
&gt; behavior and <br/>
&gt; who she is due to the pain I subjected her to. I always knew I loved <br/>
&gt; her, and <br/>
&gt; thought that was enough, but one day the question occured to me does <br/>
&gt; she know <br/>
&gt; i love her, beyond a shadow of a doubt. I am so thankful to be where <br/>
&gt; we are <br/>
&gt; now, growing and loving and learning together, and all hope is not <br/>
&gt; lost. <br/>
&gt; Ironically, I was trying to train her and break her will before I <br/>
&gt; found the <br/>
&gt; Lord, and I don&#39;t feel that is the way He has led me since. He taught <br/>
&gt; me to <br/>
&gt; love her and accept her, nurture her and treasure her, the way He <br/>
&gt; does me, <br/>
&gt; His child. I believe he has shown me to trust my instincts that were <br/>
&gt; previously mostly ignored, trying to trust &quot;experts&quot; that knew better <br/>
&gt; than <br/>
&gt; me. I wished I had coslept and carried my 10yo dd, the bond was being <br/>
&gt; severed <br/>
&gt; as early as my practice of &quot;separation parenting&quot;, which is the <br/>
&gt; societal norm <br/>
&gt; and direct opposite of attachment parenting that I practice with my <br/>
&gt; subsequent children. If I come across any Southern Baptists or <br/>
&gt; Christians who <br/>
&gt; believe the way you portray, I would pray for them and not listen to <br/>
&gt; them for <br/>
&gt; a minute. It is also ironic that I am a homeschooler and Christian, I <br/>
&gt; am not <br/>
&gt; a homeschooler because it&#39;s the Christian thing to do, I am an <br/>
&gt; unschooler <br/>
&gt; because I am led to believe it is the parenting thing to do, I just <br/>
&gt; happen to <br/>
&gt; be a Christian. I have met some Christian homeschoolers, and joined a <br/>
&gt; Christian group, but I am sure I am not like many of them!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I love this group and enjoy learning not only about unschooling, but <br/>
&gt; learning <br/>
&gt; so much about myself from the reflection here. Thanks, I am grateful <br/>
&gt; for all <br/>
&gt; of you! <br/>
