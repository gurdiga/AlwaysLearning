Pam&#39;s post said some in her group were &quot;openly judgmental&quot; about<br/>

I love a rousing discussion about religion with my Christian friends,<br/>
when everyone is in the mood to discuss and debate.  But a nasty stab, if<br/>
that&#39;s what Pam was talking about, is still nasty.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure I&#39;m guilty.  I can&#39;t tell you how tired I am of the church chat<br/>
around here.  <br/>
The assumption that EVERYONE is Christian, and the cold shoulder when<br/>
they find out you&#39;re not.  I&#39;ve had the questions about hell too, and my<br/>
favorites,  &quot;don&#39;t you want to hear the good news about our Lord?&quot; <br/>
(whose Lord?) and  &quot; Do you know the Lord?&quot;  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>It is pretty rare, yes. But my point is that it is much more rare in our <br/>
group for it to be the religious people, Christian or otherwise, to be the <br/>
ones who are rude.<br/>
<br/>
For example, one thing I remember was someone saying recently: &quot;Religion and <br/>
morality are mutually exclusive.&quot;  Another was someone said, &quot;Religious <br/>
people have chosen not to think for themselves.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
These kinds of comments leave me at a loss as to how to respond. I&#39;m not a <br/>
Christian, I am a Baha&#39;i, but we also have several very much Christian <br/>
families in our group. They are there because they PREFER our kind of group - <br/>
they are attachment parenting, La Leche League, relaxed homeschooling people. <br/>
 I don&#39;t get easily offended - so I can&#39;t say these comments really offended <br/>
me and I can ignore them, especially since I know and very much like the <br/>
people making the statements. But I cringe when we have new people and these <br/>
kinds of blanket statements are made in front of them or even to them. A very <br/>
sweet, new-to-our-group mom - thrilled to find unschoolers and a casual <br/>
accepting group - was really put on the spot recently when she DID respond to <br/>
statements like this by saying that she was a Christian and didn&#39;t feel that <br/>
she was being fairly represented by the kinds of statements being made. Like <br/>
I said, she was new, the rest of us were used to these comments and would <br/>
just let them pass us by, changing the subject. But I hate it when it happens <br/>
- I usually find I suddenly have to go to the bathroom (to get away).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1438206129">&lt;&lt; &quot;Religion and morality are mutually exclusive.&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had people (Christian homeschoolers, online, in the old days) ask me <br/>
how, if I didn&#39;t teach my kids religion, could I hope to teach them how to <br/>
behave.  &quot;How will you teach them good from bad?&quot;  (Or maybe the question was <br/>
right from wrong...)<br/>
<br/>
The idea that people will only be good because of fear of reprisal is lame <br/>
and immature and feeds MORE into the idea that religion is a necessity than <br/>
not.  <br/>
<br/>
So did the person who said the think above intend to say that WITH religion <br/>
there could be no morality?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t understand the statement.  But I&#39;m really curious because of my prior <br/>
defense of it being easy to teach kids how to act with other people on the <br/>
basis of what is good and bad within human interaction itself.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Another was someone said, &quot;Religious people have chosen not to think for <br/>
themselves.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Most haven&#39;t.  Some have.<br/>
<br/>
I think I would have just said &quot;You need to learn to qualify your statements <br/>
better or they&#39;ll all be false.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Some people join the military or go (back) to prison or join a cult to keep <br/>
from thinking for themselves.  Some people join a strict church in the same <br/>
way.  It removes from them any further responsibility for their actions.  If <br/>
they just follow the formula and do what those around them do and approve of, <br/>
they will have approval, a social group, and can go to sleep happy that they <br/>
are &quot;doing the right thing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But I see that with non-religious folk too.  I was at a conference (Pam was <br/>
too) which was totally NOT religious, and there were people who were picking <br/>
up and buying, swearing to, adopting, every practice that seemed to them <br/>
would make them &quot;one of these people.&quot;   Like... What do New Age families <br/>
eat?  What do they do for a winter holiday?  What do they do for medicine?  <br/>
Tea?  Clothing?  There are magazines and various support groups from which a <br/>
person can adopt a lifestyle complete with beliefs, diet and dresscode.  <br/>
They&#39;ll soon know what car&#39;s good to drive, and what pets would be best, by <br/>
just doing what&#39;s around them.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just clearer and more obvious in a church that will TELL you to <br/>
homeschool, and how.  (We had neighbors at our old house who went to the <br/>
central homeschooling-hive church in town here.  They were homeschooling <br/>
because it was a sin not to.  Their lives revolved around the church <br/>
entirely.  Once the mom told me she didn&#39;t know what she was serving for <br/>
dessert that night, but Jesus would provide.   I was just glad the rest of <br/>
her church hadn&#39;t figured out her kids were mixing with mine a lot! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
They ended up divorced.  She took up with a younger Jewish guy with a jacuzzi <br/>
in his bedroom.  The husband had the kids most of the time, taking them to <br/>
church extra much.   I&#39;m sorry we lost contact with them, but they moved to <br/>
another town.<br/>

But on a technicality I&#39;d yield.  <br/>
There are definitions and aspects of morality which just about require <br/>
religion.  Catholics used to teach kids in my town in the 1960&#39;s that short <br/>
skirts and sleeveless dresses were immoral.  A hundred years before that, <br/>
mid-calf skirts and short sleeves would have been immoral.   <br/>
<br/>
But I think if your atheist-agitator had said ethics, instead of morality, <br/>
I&#39;d concede.<br/>

Sheila, have you actually, yourself, read the entire Bible thoughtfully, or <br/>
are you  just believing and repeating what someone else told you about it?<br/>
<br/>
Believing and repeating aren&#39;t good models for unschooling.<br/>
They work with regular school, and with a curriculum, but consider these <br/>
questions:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The stars don&#39;t light the earth.<br/>
And what lit the earth before God created stars (which don&#39;t either)?<br/>
<br/>
Where did that water come from to cover the face of the entire earth?<br/>
<br/>
What did the animals eat after Noah&#39;s ark landed?  How long do you think it <br/>
would have taken for the land to dry out?  What plants would have lived? And <br/>
did the carnivores eat each other?<br/>
<br/>
Do you think God has stopped the sun in the sky (more than once)?<br/>
<br/>
Will you answer all hard questions with &quot;Don&#39;t ask&quot;?  <br/>
<br/>
Is the ultimate answer to everything &quot;It&#39;s a miracle&quot;?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well it was meant as a &quot;for instance&quot; example but it would work better with<br/>
something we have right now.<br/>
<br/>
The Bible doesn&#39;t specifically mention cloning, does it? God didn&#39;t say Thou<br/>
shalt not clone. To figure out what God wants man to do about cloning don&#39;t<br/>
you need to extrapolate from God&#39;s wishes on other things?<br/>
<br/>
What about pollution, destruction of habitats, smoking? (I&#39;d need some help<br/>
here from someone who knows the Bible better! ;-) Undoubtedly there are<br/>
lists of things that exist today that aren&#39;t specifically spelled out in<br/>
other &quot;do what God wants&quot; religions like Judaism and Islam.<br/>
<br/>
If morality is based on what God wants rather than what is right, then when<br/>
faced with a situation that isn&#39;t specifically spelled out, then man is in<br/>
the position of interpetting the mind of God rather than figuring out what<br/>
is right.<br/>
<br/>
(And I&#39;m not saying I believe they&#39;re mutually exclusive. Only that&#39;s what<br/>
Religion and morality are mutually exclusive seems to be saying.)<br/>
<br/>
The Golden Rule is a pretty universal moral arrived at independently in many<br/>
places and many times. You don&#39;t need a God to tell you it&#39;s true. It&#39;s just<br/>
a reasonable idea among creatures that are naturally social, perhaps an<br/>
inherent part of being social. So is Do as much good and as little harm as<br/>
possible.<br/>
<br/>
But when morality is ethics mixed in with requirements from God, then<br/>
doesn&#39;t it become almost impossible to know what God wants man to do in<br/>
situations that aren&#39;t specifically spelled out? The Golden Rule is<br/>
derivable from living. &quot;You shall have no other gods besides Me,&quot; and &quot;You<br/>
shall not make for yourself an idol, or any likeness of what is in heaven<br/>
above or on earth beneath or in the water under the earth,&quot; or &quot;You shall<br/>
not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not leave<br/>
him unpunished who takes His name in vain,&quot; or &quot;Remember the sabbath day, to<br/>
keep it holy,&quot; all need specifically spelled out for someone to recognize<br/>
them as morals.<br/>
<br/>
(And I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m still getting it clear and perhaps they meant<br/>
something entirely different so there isn&#39;t a real reason for discussing it.<br/>
;-)<br/>

It certainly is multiplying!  But it&#39;s an unnatural act.  <br/>

Smoking is handled under the &quot;your body is a temple&quot; clause.<br/>

&lt;&lt;What about pollution, destruction of habitats, smoking? (I&#39;d need some help<br/>

<br/>
One way of looking at pollution and desctruction of habitats and extinction <br/>
of species is that we should concern ourselves with the souls of men and the <br/>
worship of God, and have faith that Jesus is coming back any minute.  So to <br/>
treat the earth as though it&#39;s a long-range situation instead of the 6,000 <br/>

<br/>
Well don&#39;t bother laughing at me.<br/>
If you act like Jesus is NOT coming tomorrow (say my Baptist teachers and a <br/>
million others like them) it&#39;s a lack of faith.  God didn&#39;t make man to <br/>
defend the rain forest.  God&#39;s eye is on the sparrow, and it&#39;s not our place <br/>
to mess with God&#39;s will, but Jesus is coming (they say) and we need to be <br/>
ready.  One species or another doesn&#39;t matter when the world will be <br/>
destroyed by fire.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re not laughing at all.<br/>
<br/>

inhabitants; something I&#39;m afraid no one group has done too well at.<br/>
Christian or not. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And no one group CAN do, because there are so many factors no one group will <br/>
ever get it right and provide for the needs for all.  But people keep on <br/>
trying.  And Christians believe that God&#39;s already done it the right way long <br/>
ago and our job is just to trust Jesus and wait and watch to the horrible <br/>
imminent end.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever people want to think or think would be right, that&#39;s the way a WHOLE <br/>

homeschooling families.<br/>

to ride on the back of another creature. Though burrs do it purely for<br/>
transportation reasons -- as opposed to parasites that use a body as a home<br/>
or breeding ground -- so perhaps that&#39;s okay.<br/>
<br/>
There isn&#39;t much natural about flying in a jet. Though some animals use jet<br/>
propulsion so maybe that&#39;s okay too.<br/>
<br/>
But is it okay to use a machine to assist when animals use only their own<br/>
God provided bodies? So would we be allowed to alter our own bodies to be<br/>
like other naturally occuring bodies or only like other naturally occuring<br/>
human bodies? If we can only do what is natural to humans then we shouldn&#39;t<br/>
be imitating burrs and riding on animals. If it is natural for us to use<br/>
machines to help us because our brains are God designed to do that, then<br/>
isn&#39;t cloning just another use of machines?<br/>
<br/>
Or is it Thou shalt not commit any unnatural reproductive acts? So fertility<br/>
drugs would be immoral? Unless fertility drugs are merely extras of<br/>
naturally occuring chemicals in the body. So is it natural to bring<br/>
someone&#39;s low body chemistry up to the average? (Like insulin for<br/>
diabetics?) How about up to well above average if it&#39;s a level that occurs<br/>
naturally so someone becomes super fertile (to fill up that quiver really<br/>
fast)? So wouldn&#39;t that mean breast implants are morally acceptable because<br/>
some women do naturally have very large breasts? Though perhaps only if the<br/>
implants are made of fat.<br/>

some of the religion&#39;s moral requirements can look neutral.<br/>
<br/>
But the problem is that what God/gods want seems -- from outside a religion<br/>
-- to occasionally override what seems to be a more universal morality.<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, I think what&#39;s confusing is what morality is keeps slipping back and<br/>
forth between a universal morality and what an individual defines as<br/>
morality. *If* moral is doing what God wants then *only* religious people<br/>
can be moral since no one outside the religion could independently arrive at<br/>
the non-universal morals like keeping the Sabbath holy or how to keep it<br/>
holy or even that a Sabbath existed or what a Sabbath was or what that<br/>
particular God meant by holy.<br/>
<br/>
Since the statement was made outside of religion, they apparently accept<br/>
that there&#39;s a universal morality. (For example be kind, be compassionate.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If God&#39;s morality and a universal morality are one and the same, then doing<br/>
(universally) right, being (universally) moral and doing God&#39;s will are all<br/>
one and the same.<br/>
<br/>
*If* God has additional requirements in order to be considered moral by<br/>
God&#39;s standards, especially requirements relating to our relationship with<br/>
God, then those extra requirements aren&#39;t derivable from living life from<br/>
the point of view of a universal morality, like being kind to each other.<br/>
They can only be gotten from reading a particular God&#39;s words.<br/>
<br/>
*If* what God wants includes overriding universal morals based on what God<br/>
wants -- not necessarily what makes sense from a universal moral point of<br/>
view -- then that person is moral if they do what God says but not moral by<br/>
universal standards.<br/>
<br/>
In the Old Testament God wanted the Jews to crush the people living in<br/>
Israel because God promised that land to the Jews. So apparently for God it<br/>
being moral to treat some humans as lesser than other humans.<br/>
<br/>
In the Bhagavadgita the god/aspect of god, Krishna, spends the book<br/>
convincing the prince, who is siding with the morals of the priestly caste<br/>
that killing is wrong, that it is the prince&#39;s moral duty to go to war<br/>
because he&#39;s of the princely caste. And that birth, karma, requires him to<br/>
do what his position requires of him.<br/>
<br/>
If a universal morality can be overridden by what God wants, then how can a<br/>
moral person judge what is moral when sometimes universal morality gets<br/>
overriden? When faced with a situation that is similar to a previous<br/>
override, is it okay to override for this time? (There were undoubtedly<br/>
Biblical justifications for slavery, for instance.)<br/>
<br/>
So viewing the supposed moral requirements from the point of view of a<br/>
universal morality, those religions are requiring the followers to be<br/>
Immoral (by universal standards) in order to be moral within that religion.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I took it to mean she thought you really just couldn&#39;t be religious and moral<br/>
&gt; (do the right thing) at the same time - that one contradicted the other<br/>
&gt; automatically. I thought she meant that BEING religious made you<br/>
&gt; automatically immoral and being moral made you automatically NOT religious.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s the way I took it too. But it doesn&#39;t make any logical sense. Though<br/>
there is certainly data to support it, there&#39;s far more contradictory data.<br/>
It only makes sense as a statement of anger against something they&#39;ve been<br/>
hurt by, sort of like calling all men pigs after a bad ending to a<br/>
relationship. Which is not uncommon with people who&#39;ve become atheists<br/>
because of a bad experience with religion. But it gives the rest of us<br/>
atheists a bad name ;-)<br/>
