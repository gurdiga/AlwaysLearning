<div id="ygrps-yiv-1079716115">My kids, 10 and 15 have tv freedom.  I talk to the 10yo about things that I feel necessary, but that trust factor takes over in the end.  I trust that she&#39;s working something out that I don&#39;t know or understand at that moment.  I think they sometimes want to see how awful people can treat each other at a safe distance and live vicariously.<br/>
 <br/>
They both watch more than I would like, lots of days we (thier dad and I) ask them to turn it off so we can have some quiet.  That is about us and what our need is at the moment rather than a judgement about tv or their behavior.  (The tv is placed pretty centrally for when we all want to watch - probably not the best place for it.)  <br/>
 <br/>
Tv lowers the brain waves to the pre-sleep state, so things that are going in hypnoticcally and it&#39;s really hard to make a conscious choice to turn it off.  But afterwards, the 10yo will realize that that isn&#39;t how she wants to spend her time and she sees how addicting it can be.  <br/>
 <br/>
Tv is a series of 600 black dots that light up in sequence over and over.  This is damaging to the brain development to children under age 7.<br/>
 <br/>
My parents were tv addicts and we &quot;slept&quot; through my childhood with the tv on every waking moment.  I still feel sad about that.<br/>

&lt;&lt;Tv lowers the brain waves to the pre-sleep state, so things that are going <br/>
in hypnoticcally and it&#39;s really hard to make a conscious choice to turn it <br/>
off.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read this in two books, and heard it parotted by &quot;educators,&quot; but I <br/>
haven&#39;t seen it seem true with kids who weren&#39;t limited.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen kids dance and talk and run to the other room to get me to show me <br/>
something, and if it&#39;s hard to make a choice to turn it off, it&#39;s for the same <br/>
reason it&#39;s hard to put a good book down.  The mind is engaged, not asleep.<br/>
<br/>
The tests I&#39;ve read about that some of that &quot;research&quot; was based on was <br/>
putting daycare or school kids in a room pointed at a program chosen by the re<br/>
searcher, and they were wired up and told &quot;watch this.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t real kids in the real world making a choice to watch something or <br/>
not.<br/>
<br/>
Please don&#39;t believe all the research you see which is designed to support <br/>
schools&#39; agendas.<br/>
<br/>
For example, Sesame Street:  Educational research created Sesame Street for <br/>
sound reasons.  Also Schoolhouse Rock came out of the same research, and they <br/>
were popular AND effective.<br/>
<br/>
Then a few years later, educational reasearch turned on Sesame Street, to try <br/>
to blame it for &quot;short attention span,&quot; which was bullshit.    Sesame Street <br/>
was created to make learning easier for kids, theoretically so school would be <br/>
easier for them (and thereby success in life, yada yada).<br/>
<br/>
But school had been kinda counting on kids being ignorant.  Kids who don&#39;t <br/>
already KNOW their numbers and letters might possibly sit still for a boring <br/>
long lesson.    Kids with no other option for learning letters will carve them <br/>
out on a wax slate that has to be re-melted on a wood stove that night, but <br/>
those days are LONG, long gone, and to rein kids in from cutting edge opportunity <br/>
(these days, computer games) is selfish cruelty on the part of adults who <br/>
don&#39;t want to lose their audience for their lame old-timey presentations.<br/>
<br/>
There never was a uniformly ignorant kindergarten class anyway, but if the <br/>
teachers can blame a few parents that&#39;s limited.  (Parents are told &quot;don&#39;t teach <br/>
these things at home, because he&#39;ll be ahead of the other kids and that&#39;s <br/>
hard on kids.&quot;)  But if they can find one big scapegoat like Children&#39;s <br/>
Television Workshop and heap blame on THEM, a few people get master&#39;s degrees or PhDs <br/>
for their &quot;research,&quot; which gets them out of the classroom and into the <br/>
administration, and schools are &quot;better served.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As unschoolers we don&#39;t have to buy into their stuff, and that anti-TV <br/>
propaganda is part and parcel of their &quot;science.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Hard because you&#39;re hynotized by 600 black dots, or hard because it&#39;s <br/>
interesting?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard for me to leave a bar or restaurant where there&#39;s live music I&#39;m <br/>
enjoying.  I don&#39;t know if the very next song is going to be one I don&#39;t want to <br/>
miss.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard for me to leave a restaurant when I&#39;m having fun with friends or <br/>
family and there&#39;s still anything left in my glass (tea, soda, anything).  I&#39;m <br/>
not mesmerized, I&#39;m engaged.<br/>
<br/>
I have to force myself to put a book down, lots of times.<br/>
<br/>
I often sit in the car with the radio on until a good stopping place in the <br/>
song.<br/>
<br/>
When I visit friends, I&#39;m rarely anxious to go home.<br/>
<br/>
When I get seeds off the morning glory vines (which I&#39;ve been doing lately, <br/>
because first I wanted to give my sister some, and now we&#39;re planning to &quot;plan<br/>
t&quot; Holly a playhouse next year, a flower-bower), I have a hard time telling <br/>
myself &quot;that&#39;s the last one, come back tomorrow,&quot; and I&#39;m usually right to <br/>
stay--I find a few more that would have dumped themselves on the ground by the next <br/>
day if I hadn&#39;t gotten them.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;m not advocating big TV limits, but I do think that some people need more<br/>
help regulating than others.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do you really think television itself is physically holding on to people, and <br/>
that it&#39;s not their interest in the program or their avoidance of the thing <br/>
(whatever it might be) that their mom is wanting them to do instead?  <br/>

<br/>
I do think there is something about the electronic media themselves. I love<br/>
television and movies and the computer, but I have too often watched<br/>
something or stayed online past when I really wanted to and not because what<br/>
was on the screen was more interesting than what other things awaited me.<br/>
<br/>
This has never happened to me with a book. I will stay up way too late to<br/>
finish a great book, but have no problem putting down a book that is boring.<br/>

at the time as pretty low brow like Lost In Space -- in the middle. I needed<br/>
to see how it would resolve. But that&#39;s engagement and closure.<br/>
<br/>
I remember having a different attitude towards TV when I worked. We really<br/>
enjoyed watching reruns during dinner: MASH, Mary Tyler Moore, Cheers. They<br/>
were comforting and familiar and relaxing and it would have been fine if<br/>
they&#39;d gone on all evening. Playing a game was too much effort.<br/>
<br/>
But it wasn&#39;t addiction since I have no problems walking away from TV now.<br/>

&gt; Patti, trying to understand<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes it&#39;s addictive personality and tendancy.  I have the same <br/>
problem.  I will keep at it till I have a headache or am kicking <br/>
myself over the time wasted when I wanted to get something else <br/>
done.  For me staying away from broadcast tv on the whole is a <br/>
better plan, even when I am, say, visiting my parents or something.  <br/>
Just like it&#39;s not a good idea for an alcoholic to hang around with <br/>
drinkers or in bars.  It&#39;s a problem that addicts are made to feel <br/>
embarassed about, and told does not exist, and told they are just <br/>
making excuses.  It is a real problem.  I know lots of addicts and <br/>
alcoholics and those affected by them.  I grew up in a alcoholic <br/>
home, and I recognize the tendancies in myself and stay away from <br/>
drugs, alcohol and other addictive things that cause problems for <br/>
me, like the tv.  My husband is a 15 years recovering drug addict <br/>
and has problems getting too wrapped up in computer games especially <br/>
and has to police himself.  Thomas, my older son, has similar issues <br/>
and problems.  We choose as a family to avoid broadcast tv for this <br/>
reason in addition to the behavior affects it was having on Thomas.<br/>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed that with Jaiden(5) he seems to be a kinesthetic(did I spell that right?) learner. He doesn&#39;t like to sit and be read to. He fig-its and bounces and just can&#39;t get into laying or sitting together and reading. He loves books on tape, tv, videos, sometimes he asks me to read to him while he plays, but not very often. That way he can play and incorporate what he&#39;s listening to in his games. <br/>
<br/>
Avery(2) loves music. Any thing musical will capture his interest and hold it. He also will be intensely physical, running in circles, jumping off of everything he can climb on top of, singing...then suddenly stop and lay in front of the tv and watch something with total fascination, then get up run some more. It&#39;s very strange and at times a bit startling, but it&#39;s the way he seems to process information.<br/>
<br/>
I do think that everyone learns and processes information differently. It&#39;s one of the many reasons I&#39;m so glad that we discovered unschooling. My kids get the chance to discover themselves and the best way to learn and live for themselves, with out me or anyone else trying to force them to do things the &quot;correct&quot; (contrived schooly) way.<br/>
