<div id="ygrps-yiv-1492843310">Will and I drove about 70 miles one-way to go roller skating with  another <br/>
homeschool group.  We&#39;re expanding our circles, and one of the  familes in that <br/>
group attends some of our unschooler things.  Will hasn&#39;t  been skating since <br/>
we left Memphis, so we thought it would be fun, and we  planned to hit some <br/>
flea markets on the way home.<br/>
 <br/>
We didn&#39;t know we would have a once in a lifetime opportunity.   We saw the <br/>
third largest meteorite ever found in the world today, live and in  person, in <br/>
the back of a pick-up truck and learned all about it from its owner,  a <br/>
homeschool dad from Huntsville, AR.  It&#39;s worth more than a million  dollars.<br/>
 <br/>
Here&#39;s the website for the meteorite:  worldrecordmeteorite.com   You should <br/>
be hearing more about it outside of Kansas and on the Discovery  Channel and <br/>
other places soon.  He&#39;s fielding lots and lots of calls and  inquiries.<br/>
 <br/>
It was well worth the 140 miles!<br/>
