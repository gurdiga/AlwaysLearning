<div id="ygrps-yiv-1756097310">As some of you know, I work as a Director of Religious Education at a <br/>
Unitarian Universalist church in Massachusetts. I recently wrote an article <br/>
that was published on UU Faithworks, a publication for UU religious <br/>
educators. The title is &quot;What Religious Educators can learn From <br/>
Homeschoolers.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
That was fun to read!<br/>
So are they going to fire you now that you don&#39;t want to teach kids facts and <br/>
history? &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
(joking)<br/>
<br/>
This I do have a question about though:  -=-Parents are the primary educators <br/>
of their children. Whether or not a child goes to school, families are the <br/>
center of a child&#39;s learning. While as ministers and religious educators we <br/>
can support children, youth, and families in growing in their spiritual <br/>
journeys, we are a resource rather than the experience itself. The real work <br/>
happens at home. -=-<br/>
<br/>
There are kids like I was whose spiritual journeys were NOT at home nearly as <br/>
much as they were at church.  Maybe UUs don&#39;t get many kids without their <br/>
parents, but I knew other kids whose parents were pretty worthless to them <br/>
religiously speaking.  So if you count on the family beng the experience for <br/>
every kid, some will lose out.  <br/>
<br/>
(Probably they will find other families or adults to use for that learning <br/>
purpose, though.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-13405280">Hi Kathryn,<br/>
<br/>
I am a fellow UU unschooler living in California now,<br/>
but from Massachusetts.  We were memebers of the UU<br/>
Church of Reading MA.  So good to hear from you! <br/>
Being a UU and an unschooler makes so much sense to<br/>
me, I don&#39;t know why more don&#39;t do it!<br/>
<br/>
Michele<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Kathryn, that was great! You wrote out all the ideas I&#39;ve had swirling<br/>
around in my head about RE that I haven&#39;t had time to express. Do you mind<br/>
if I forward it to our RE committee? They aren&#39;t quite as progressive as<br/>
yours -- well except for me ;-) -- but they seem to be on the brink of<br/>
seeing this themselves -- even if they do send their kids to school ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1611576906">That article is beautiful.  We are learning so much spirituality here<br/>
all of us, since we are Homeschooling.  There is a threshold of<br/>
happiness here and fulfillment of ourselves and each other.   I wish to<br/>
belong to a fellowship like the one you described.  Maybe one of these<br/>
days.  Lisa of MT<br/>
