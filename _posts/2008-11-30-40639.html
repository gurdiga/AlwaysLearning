<div id="ygrps-yiv-27450278">we just caught the 2008 magic awards on satellite TV, while we were on vacation, and my son was completely captivated (as was i!)  i would love to hunt down 2007 (i don&#39;t know if it existed before then, no mention online) on dvd (youtube is poor quality and he really doesn&#39;t want to watch it that way) and i&#39;d love 2008 as well, on dvd, as we missed the first half of it.  by chance did any of the thousands on this list happen to record it and if so, would you be willing to send me a copy?  i&#39;d be willing to pay for time and shipping!<br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s called the &quot;World Magic Awards&quot;. It looks like it was broadcast  <br/>
on UHF stations so you should be able to catch it next year.<br/>
<br/>
Google video shows the awards show going back to 2006:<br/>

The quality on some might be a bit better than YouTube (though some  <br/>
just link to YouTube).<br/>
<br/>
(Though I see magicians claiming various awards going back further,  <br/>
but maybe it wasn&#39;t broadcast in the US.)<br/>
<br/>
If you go to &quot;My Network TV&quot; (which is what the group of stations is  <br/>
called) you can sign up for their newsletter and they&#39;ll let you know  <br/>
when it&#39;s coming around again. Apparently they played the 2007 awards  <br/>
again last April.<br/>

It might be worth checking over the next couple of weeks:<br/>

They&#39;re all legitimate portals for TV shows now that networks put up.  <br/>
The quality there should be very good.<br/>

I&#39;m building a page out of that.  Still working on it, but it&#39;s  <br/>
started here:<br/>

<br/>
So if people want it later and can&#39;t remember the name of the show,  <br/>
search magic on this list or my site.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-187849183">i just found the 2006 (or maybe it was 2005...) available on dvd at amazon.uk.  ONLY there, apparently, and only that year.  but it was only 3L (pounds) plus a couple shipping, to the US...<br/>
<br/>
here is the link:<br/>
