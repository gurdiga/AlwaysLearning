<div id="ygrps-yiv-44261310">I just don&#39;t get the D & D hell, fire and brimstone thing!  My kids  <br/>
LOVE it and when I say love, it is their very favorite thing to play  <br/>
with their dad.  Dh, by the way is the world&#39;s best Dungeon Master.   <br/>
He really gets into it and uses all kinds of funny voices and acts  <br/>
out the parts and creates a very exciting game for them.  Just the  <br/>
other night, my daughter cried actual tears of proud joy when she  <br/>
killed her first dragon and saved her brothers lives.  Oh, yes, they  <br/>
are all doomed with all that nonsense @@ (doesn&#39;t that mean &quot;rolling  <br/>
eyes&quot;?)<br/>
<br/>
I actually had a mom in my neighborhood ask me one time if I was a  <br/>
&quot;white witch&quot; since I am very into herbal healing. lol  Lots of the  <br/>
witches executed during all the witch hunts were actually midwives.   <br/>
They were thought to have magical powers with all of their secrets of  <br/>
birth and plants.   Fear keeps lots of people in line.  It can be a  <br/>
very powerful motivator, that is unless you know the real truth....<br/>

<br/>
They&#39;re sure they know the real truth, which is why they&#39;re not  <br/>
afraid.  I was Southern Baptist until I was seventeen and went back  <br/>
to church and told them I wanted to remove my membership from their  <br/>
rolls.  They had no idea how to do that.  People had transferred  <br/>
memberships to other churches, but to just cross me out?  That didn&#39;t  <br/>
make sense to them.  I had to be counted as just gone for now.  I  <br/>
knew they loved their statistics, and I didn&#39;t want to be &quot;absent&quot;  <br/>
for the rest of my life, but there it was.  I was baptized in that  <br/>
church, they had seen evidence that I was &quot;really saved,&quot; and I had  <br/>
done more Bible study and more choir singing (junior and adult at the  <br/>
same time for a year or two) than any other single kid at that  <br/>
church, so where would they mark that I&#39;d gone?  Humanism?   <br/>
Hedonism?  Hippieville?   Yet I was gone.<br/>
<br/>
But as to &quot;real truth,&quot; they have a book they don&#39;t doubt.<br/>
<br/>
We have logic (leaning to our own understanding) and Satan.  And D&D.<br/>
<br/>
The story of Kirby multiplying by 18 in his head is a D&D success  <br/>
story. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/timestables">http://sandradodd.com/timestables</a><br/>
<br/>
The story of Kirby figuring out sales tax in his head, selling stuff  <br/>
for several hours without a tax table or a calculator, is a D&D  <br/>
tournament running story.   Kirby knows LOTS about management and  <br/>
organization from having help run and judging and explaining and  <br/>
overseeing various D&D tournaments during the years he worked for  <br/>
Active Imagination.  Not in the store, but in hotel banquet rooms and  <br/>
the centers of malls and city buildings.  (No, it was Pokemon in the  <br/>
mall.)<br/>
<br/>
For my kids it was the math from the D&D dice that I remember most as  <br/>
an unschooling mom who didn&#39;t play the game. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

*I* was actually quite bad at even basic math before dh corralled me into<br/>
playing D&D and Magic The Gathering. I am much better now :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1517084990">I guess I meant &quot;truth&quot; in so many areas of life.  Not just religion,  <br/>
but unschooling, consumerism, housing, government, medical care....<br/>
<br/>
Dh and i were talking about this conversation this afternoon and  <br/>
started questioning how people come to believe &quot;their truth&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
We agreed we both believed in dinosaurs (I grew up in a Southern  <br/>
Baptist school that taught that they didn&#39;t even exist!) even though  <br/>
neither one of us has personally dug up any bones, done any  <br/>
scientific research or even really understand carbon dating very  <br/>
well.  So, we take as fact that someone else has done it and we chose  <br/>
to believe it.  Maybe a bit of a stretch on the theory, but an  <br/>
interesting exercise to pull back and question the &quot;truth&quot;.  I know  <br/>
many of the people at my childhood church believe to this day that  <br/>
those dinosaurs are one big hoax, that is their truth, supported by  <br/>
evidence in their book.  Did we really land on the moon?  Is our  <br/>
nation really the good guys?  Who killed the electric car?  I could  <br/>
go on, but really I think I should stop now  &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1136507073">This isn&#39;t about D&D so much as it&#39;s about the idea of truth.  Here&#39;s  <br/>
a quote from an e-mail I just got (and it&#39;s in full below, but isn&#39;t  <br/>
important to the discussion):<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s in context below.  Homeschooling has more of this division than  <br/>
any other area I know, where one faction (a big one, with money, in  <br/>
the case of homeschooling) believes some of the others are not just  <br/>
ignoring truth, but endangering their children&#39;s lives, futures,  <br/>
souls.      These families&#39; kids won&#39;t be playing D&D.<br/>
<br/>
What any one unschooling family believes won&#39;t be the same as all the  <br/>
others.  Some are very focussed on ecology or vegetarianism or new  <br/>
age something or a particular religion or stock car racing or RV  <br/>
travel.   That&#39;s okay!!  The principles of unschooling will work in  <br/>
any of those cases.  And I&#39;ve seen very religious unschooling  <br/>
families that were doing a good job of balancing things.<br/>
<br/>
Go easy on defining &quot;truth&quot; (if it&#39;s not against your religion to do  <br/>
so).<br/>
