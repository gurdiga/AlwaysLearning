<div id="ygrps-yiv-2007731115">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
An issue that I have trouble with is my 4 year old almost 5 year old has <br/>
a binkie and shows no signs of giving it up.<br/>
<br/>
My wife and I are struggling to allow her the space and time to come to <br/>
her own and let it go.<br/>
<br/>
But as she gets older this becomes tough and social pressures mount.<br/>
<br/>
Is there a way to help her let it go and not just force the issue.<br/>
<br/>
The worry of course is the teeth going crooked but maybe we are past that.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone dealt with this?<br/>
<br/>
I know this is as much my issue as hers, and it bothers me that she <br/>
still holds on to it.<br/>
<br/>
I would love your thoughts!</div>

<br/>
Perhaps it&#39;s MORE your issue than hers, and it might be easier for you to attempt to recover from the concern than for her to leave the binkie.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe not, but it&#39;s worth putting that idea on the table.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1518728666">Hello, i would let her. I was a severe thumb sucker as in the only time it<br/>
left my mouth was when food was entering or if i was talking to teachers<br/>
because they scolded me if i tried to talk to them with it in there lol.<br/>
<br/>
my thumb even had this small bump on it because of the amount of thumb<br/>
sucking i did lol, thats how much time it spent in there, not many other<br/>
children made too much fun, or maybe I just didn&#39;t care?<br/>
<br/>
My mom tried to get me to stop, the more she tried, the more I resisted,<br/>
then when I was 15 I just stopped out of nowhere, just stopped.<br/>
<br/>
I have 4 boys whom i all nursed, and they never took the paci, until about<br/>
18 months old when they were weaning and then one had his til about 5 and<br/>
then one day boom it was gone and that was that. my youngest was 28 months<br/>
when he stopped nursing, but never liked the paci lol, he just liked to bite<br/>
it though, but it&#39;s a sensory thing for him.<br/>
<br/>
maybe she is looking for a sensory input, and it is a comfort for her.<br/>
<br/>
btw, i&#39;m 32(please knock on trees) I have no cavities, no buck teeth at all,<br/>
never needed braces at all, have pearly whites, never been bleached, never<br/>
needed to. perfect teeth. so imo I would let her, the more you push, or<br/>
coerce the more she will want it.<br/>
<br/>
I hope I am not stepping on toes saying this.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Social pressures on  you or on her? If its her, is it possible to talk with her about that - let her know in advanced &quot;some people will call attention to the binkie and not want you to have it&quot;? I&#39;m thinking of my dd wearing dress-up costumes out in public. For awhile it was a non-issue, but as she got older people started to comment to her about that and she didn&#39;t want the attention, so if she wanted to go out in costume I&#39;d remind her that it might set her up to talk to strangers. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1559088876">My daughter had a binkie until about age 3, but was a thumb sucker until age 14 or 15. The hospital nurses had called it &quot;self-comforting behavior&quot;. Most everyone we knew wanted me to stop it as she got older, and said that peer pressure would definitely stop it in the first grade. It did not. She didn&#39;t care what other people thought about it, and neither did I. (Sometimes she would hide it behind a book or her blankie, though. Yes, she carried a blankie everywhere for years, to the chagrin of many.) Her teeth are perfectly straight at age 17. She had a slight gap in front for a few years, but it closed on its own.<br/>
<br/>
It seemed to me that if my child&#39;s self-comforting behavior was stifled, another behavior that other adults would find even more irritating would show up in its place. And then she and I would hear complaints about THAT behavior. Three moms I knew then told told me privately that either they or their teenage girls had sucked THEIR thumbs until age 16, and their teeth ended up perfectly straight. They had to tell me PRIVATELY? Yes, because there is such a stigma to the thumb.<br/>
<br/>
I think the thumb issue is just another example of adults wanting to control the behaviors of children, regardless of what might be respectful or considerate for the child.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I had a binkie until I was around 4 yrs old too.  My grandmother used to let me have it even though my mom was trying to keep it away from me.   <br/>
<br/>
I would think it is kinder to your child and more beneficial to your relationship to trust that if your child wants this to suck on (for whatever reason she has...comfort, likes it, etc) that she will stop using it when she doesn&#39;t want or need it.  The emotional upsetness of having it taken away and the power struggles that might occur about it are not worth it.  Also, she may think about what else that is so important to her might be taken away.  Others have already posted that it doesn&#39;t always affect teeth.  <br/>
<br/>
Think on this awhile.  There is no harm in waiting a little more to think about it.  Notice how much your daughter enjoys it.  (Is it really worth trying to take something away that isn&#39;t proven to be harmful and brings some kind of satisfaction to her?  And even if an orthodontist or dentist thought she might want to consider orthodontics at some future point, would it have been worth it?  I don&#39;t know the answer to that question, but it is something to consider.  Pros and cons.).  Notice what times she wants it - is it when she is sleepy?  Can you introduce a new &quot;thing&quot; that she can get some kind of comfort or satisfaction or connection with that might slowly be liked just as much (and then maybe she wouldn&#39;t eventually even want it)?  For example - backrubs, a special movie, hugging a new soft stuffed animal, drinking a cup of chamomile tea and honey while in your arms with a soft blanket around you as you rock on a comfy chair, etc.  If you are sure you still want to try to get rid of it, see if you can incorporate something just as comforting and/or satisfying instead.  I don&#39;t know if that would work, but it might be worth a try rather than suddenly taking it away.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2087635522">Forgot to mention...there is a great photo in the book by Patricia Joudry called &quot;And the children played...&quot; that shows a bunch of kids (much older than toddlers) sitting around a table drinking from baby bottles.  Here is an exerpt from page 79 of that book which is related to the photo: <br/>
<br/>
&quot;After an initial hesitation, and upon being assured that no one would tease them, all (except Tony and Angela) took to the bottle and went around looking as comforted as any adult clamped onto a cigarette.  The bottles were freely available for visiting children too, and I never saw such horrified faces as their parents&#39;, when the kids dove for them.  The bottles had to be torn out of their grasp upon leaving; and a few parents were even compelled to go to the Chemist&#39;s Shop on the way home and lay in a supply of their own.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-463151305">I just posted about my 2.5 yr old having his binkie (the neenaw). I sucked my thumb until I was 16. The only reason I stopped was because the orthodontist put a contraption on the roof of my mouth to stop me. My teeth did move and it was very obviously due to my thumb. That said, my best friend also sucked her thumb until late adolescence and has great teeth. <br/>
<br/>
In spite of all the braces and adults trying to forcibly remove my thumb from my mouth and asking me what it tasted of (it tastes like me - what a question!), I got so much comfort from my thumb. In hindsight I could have done without the orthodontic treatments but I still don&#39;t think if I&#39;d known then what I know now I would have given up my thumb. <br/>
<br/>
I guess that answers my question about my son&#39;s binkie. But I still don&#39;t know how I deal with my partner&#39;s (the father!) issue with it.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-147800156">Thanks for the feedback.  I do need to relax on this and realize that it <br/>
is my issue.  My issue in how I feel if i am judged by others and how my <br/>
daughter should be. And that having a binkie somehow makes her a baby <br/>
(and why is that bad!!).<br/>

Anyway the only reasonable issue seems to be about teeth and <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2040404486">When Simon was late 3 he had a pacifier. It was really important to him. He was <br/>
a sucker. It helped him sleep, it helped him relax, it helped zone out. We were <br/>
in Japan and I couldn&#39;t find new ones that were not for infants. And the ones he <br/>
had were getting gross and I was embarrassed. Gosh, it seems so minor and I feel <br/>
so bad about making a big deal out of something that means nothing now that he&#39;s <br/>
13. But I started to cut these gross and well used pacifiers so that he would <br/>
wean off them. Or they would be too small to suck. He didn&#39;t have options, he <br/>
had to give them up. He sucked his shirts, he sucked his thumb, he sucked <br/>
anything. He was a sucker. I apologised to him a couple of weeks ago for messing <br/>
with his pacifier, for not asking my mom to go to Toys R Us and buy a bunch and <br/>
send them to him, for not letting him have what he wanted. He told me he thinks <br/>
he&#39;s turned out alright anyhow ;). But I still feel for 3 year old Simon. <br/>
<br/>
Over at Familyrunn.ing.com Meredith made a comment that included this: &quot;The <br/>
older my kids get, the more I look back and think &quot;what was the big deal?&quot; <br/>
There&#39;s soooooo much cultural pressure on parents to guide and mold and most of <br/>
all do/tell/teach Now! Before it&#39;s Too Late! It can help to be aware of that <br/>
pressure and question it strongly. When people are ready to learn things, <br/>
learning flows. I&#39;m tempted to say it flows effortlessly, even though it can <br/>
take a fantastic effort to accomplish one&#39;s goals.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There wasn&#39;t any reason for me stopping Simon from using his pacifier. Nothing. <br/>
The teeth fear is a future fear. What will happen if her teeth are crooked? What <br/>
will happen if she&#39;s happy and smiley and the world sees that she has less than <br/>
perfect teeth? Really, what will happen? I have less than perfect teeth, (more <br/>
than perfect teeth?) and so far it hasn&#39;t adversely affected my life. The worry <br/>
about how others would think of you is a more normal one, but when you really <br/>
look at it, well, it isn&#39;t nearly as important as loving your child with or <br/>
without a pacifier. It&#39;s a small part of a life. My dad had a blanket that he <br/>
worried with his fingers. It had a satin trim and he would rub it between his <br/>
fingers until he wore it away. His mom would put new satin trim on it, each time <br/>
the blanket was smaller. I think he wore it right down. But it was a good memory <br/>
for him.And it was a sweet thing that his mom did for him. I had a boyfriend who <br/>
sucked his thumb at 24. It didn&#39;t make him less attractive, he didn&#39;t do it at <br/>
parties or around most people, but when he slept or when he was quiet and calm <br/>
he would suck his thumb and rub his nose. It&#39;s what he did. It didn&#39;t handicap <br/>
him in any way that I could tell. Your daughter likes her pacifier, her binkie. <br/>
And while you make think 4 almost 5 is too old for such a thing, 4 almost 5 is <br/>
very little. If people comment try to think of things like, oh, I wish I had <br/>
such an easy way to feel better, chuckle, or well, it was that or cigarettes. It <br/>
doesn&#39;t matter. What they think of her that moment won&#39;t tell them what to think <br/>
about her in a different moment. What they think about you, well, that&#39;s less <br/>
important probably. Really. <br/>

<br/>
How big of an issue is it? Is it enough for you to say &quot;I looked it up, and this is totally developmentally appropriate&quot;? Or is your partner carrying on about it and being unpleasant to your son? If so, then rather than talking about the binkie, I&#39;d ask him about his childhood and give him the chance to express some of the lingering issues he may have about that, or ask about how he feels about being a dad and let him express some issues he may have about that subject.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been surprised at just how much it has helped George as a parent to have a chance to talk about how he feels about being a dad and a grown-up. It has always seemed, at the time, like the conversation wasn&#39;t &quot;solving&quot; anything (and I like solving things!) but getting his feelings out in the open and feeling &quot;heard&quot; has gone a long way for George in terms of moving past his own issues and being able to see his kids as who They are, rather than reflections of his own past. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1720484450">***But as she gets older this becomes tough and social pressures mount.***<br/>
<br/>
My mom told me kids in kindergarten would make fun of me if I was still sucking my thumb.   When I got there, *lots* of kids still sucked their thumbs, or their shirts.   The only pressure I can remember was from my mom. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s possible your daughter won&#39;t notice or won&#39;t be bothered by people asking her why she still has a binkie.   If your four year old can have a healthy attitude about it, you can too! &lt;g&gt;   <br/>
<br/>
So many people want to deny children their comforts in the mistaken belief that it somehow readies them for the responsibility of adulthood.   She doesn&#39;t need to be an adult this year, or next year.   You can face a few raised eyebrows for your daughter&#39;s comfort and happiness.  <br/>
<br/>
Dylan nursed until he was four.  Lots of people made comments.  None of it bothered Dylan!  And I didn&#39;t feel badly about being judged by people who obviously weren&#39;t thinking well. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My son never sucked a binkie or his thumb and still wore braces.   He had hypodontia, genetic missing permanent teeth.   There is no precaution we might have taken against tooth problems that could have helped him except, maybe, not having him at all.  <br/>
<br/>
I would not sacrifice my child&#39;s comfort today in the hope of warding off some possible future evil.  But then, I don&#39;t believe in magic. &lt;g&gt; <br/>

<br/>
One way this list is different is that it&#39;s about the kids not about  <br/>
the parents. It&#39;s not about finding &quot;better&quot; ways for adults to  <br/>
achieve their goals for their kids. It&#39;s about kids joyful exploration  <br/>
of the world and growing relationships. And then fitting the rest of  <br/>
life into that.<br/>
<br/>
One idea that helps people do that is to turn situations around to see  <br/>
what they might look and feel like from someone else&#39;s point of view.<br/>
<br/>
What if your husband got hold of your favorite object, say the coffee  <br/>
mug you drank from each morning, that tied you emotionally to some  <br/>
happy memories over the years, and told you Santa could use it as a  <br/>
gift for someone else?<br/>
<br/>
If Santa&#39;s so desperate for things to give to people, why isn&#39;t your  <br/>
husband giving his things away instead of eyeing yours? Why is he  <br/>
asking for your favorite thing?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad your son was able to move on. But one good test of whether  <br/>
something is about a child&#39;s goals or will grow better relationships  <br/>
is whether you would do it to a friend or spouse to make them happy or  <br/>
strengthen your relationship with them.<br/>
<br/>
The insidiously bad thing about conventional parenting is that it has  <br/>
parents treating kids in ways they&#39;d never treat a friend for fear of  <br/>
losing the relationship.<br/>

him that santa was going to use it if we gave it to him for a gift  for<br/>
another boy or girl.<br/>
<br/>
A few other people we know had success with this idea.<br/>
<br/>
BEST OF LUCK!<br/>

Why does a child need to give up a pacifier?   I really don&#39;t get it.   If a child gets comfort from a pacifier, why would he need to get rid of it?  <br/>
<br/>
I would be seriously unhappy if the people in my life lied to me to manipulate me into giving up something I cared about.   I wouldn&#39;t want to do that to anyone.  <br/>
<br/>
Adults spend a lot of money and time looking for ways to comfort themselves, to relieve stress, to feel better.   Some of them are just expensive - massage, spas, therapy.    Some of them have potential risks : alcohol, prescription drugs, illegal drugs.     Maybe if parents didn&#39;t work so hard to deny children simple little comforts there&#39;d be fewer unhappy adults. <br/>
