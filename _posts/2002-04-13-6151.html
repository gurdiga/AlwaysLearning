open schools at all. <br/>
<br/>
And open classrooms are quite diferent than democratic (&quot;free&quot;) schools.<br/>
The open classrooms of my childhood did a lot with &quot;learning contracts&quot;<br/>
and independent study, and sometimes we voted on what to study for a<br/>
semester (the equal rights amendment won one semester), and we didn&#39;t<br/>
have desks and could walk around... but the teachers were still in<br/>
charge, and we were still expected to be doing *something* &quot;educational&quot;.<br/>
It was very much a school.<br/>
<br/>
We visited a democtatic school in Santa Cruz, and it was much more like<br/>
unschooling. There were different areas - a workshop, a library, a horse <br/>
- and the kids were free to do whatever interested them, or sit in a<br/>
tree, or sleep, or play mermaids, or organize a rock-climbing trip with a<br/>
teacher... or leave (after the state mandated 4 hours). I&#39;ve heard about<br/>
some of the other democratic (i.e Sudbury model) schools, and some seem<br/>
more &quot;free&quot; than others... but all were a lot freer than an open<br/>
classroom.<br/>

<br/>
Definitely.<br/>
<br/>
In Santa Fe, it was the Santa Fe Alternative School, and kids were considered <br/>
to be learning even when they were gone for days or weeks, if when they came <br/>
in they reported what they had been doing.     (As I understand it from <br/>
now-adult friends who went there--I wasn&#39;t right in Santa Fe, and never <br/>
talked to any of the teachers.  John Holt used to visit and speak there, but <br/>
it was before my time and out of my range, pretty  much.  I sure WISH I had <br/>
known and been able to hear him.)<br/>
<br/>
So open classroom is the transitional idea, in a way between traditional and <br/>
free schools.   <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the text from a site naming specific schools:<br/>

My oldest son attended two different CA schools that had been built during <br/>
the height of the &quot;open school&quot; fashion.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re horrible horrible places to be attending &quot;regular&quot; school. Because <br/>
they don&#39;t have real walls between the classes, and the &quot;walls&quot; don&#39;t go all <br/>
the way to the ceiling, and the ceiling is conical - they&#39;re very loud <br/>
places. For auditory kids it was pure torture trying to concentrate on <br/>
anything in those buildings. <br/>
