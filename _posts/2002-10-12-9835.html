<div id="ygrps-yiv-138282046">Hello All.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t post here regularly, but I thought that you&#39;d<br/>
appreciate being made aware of the following.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Kelly Lovejoy&#39;s associate in the SOS Live and<br/>
Learn UNschooling conference, presently being held in<br/>
Columbia, SC.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra is here and was scheduled to be our keynote<br/>
speaker yesterday afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
About 10 minutes before her opening remarks were<br/>
scheduled to be presented, she slipped on a wet<br/>
indoor-outdoor carpeted walkway , fell and broke her<br/>
leg.<br/>
<br/>
It is a bad break; tibia and fibula. She was<br/>
hospitalized and is scheduled to have surgery,<br/>
including the insertion of 2 pins. <br/>
<br/>
Marty is here in Columbia, attending with her. He<br/>
is,obviously, upset.<br/>
<br/>
She is very heartsick about not being able to speak as<br/>
she&#39;s scheduled to do.  She has insisted that she&#39;ll<br/>
be back to speak before the conference ends on Sunday.<br/>
<br/>
I am doubtful. Just recovering from surgery and making<br/>
arrangements to fly home in that condition will be<br/>
challenging.<br/>
<br/>
It is always very difficult to have something like<br/>
this happen .  I&#39;m sure she is very disappointed and<br/>
being across country on top of it must be just awful.<br/>
<br/>
She is at Baptist Hospital in downtown Columbia.  The<br/>
patient information number there is (803)296-5440. <br/>
<br/>
Her current room phone # is (803) 296-8931.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure she&#39;d appreciate any calls of support that<br/>
list members would choose to make.<br/>
<br/>
In case anyone is interested in sending flowers or<br/>
balloons or what-not, the address there is:  1330<br/>
Taylor St.  Columbia, SC  29220<br/>
<br/>
I thought that many of you would like to know about<br/>
her unfortunate circumstances ...   Maybe want to show<br/>
your support.<br/>
<br/>
I am hoping that she is released and well enough to<br/>
travel home SOON.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Just called her. The hospital gave me this phone number for her <br/>
room - 803-296-8031 but the switchboard will put you through.<br/>
Sandra is a bit doped up on morphine and when I spoke to her she <br/>
was waiting to go down to surgery - hopefully about noon she said.<br/>
<br/>
She may have to stay there a few days before she can fly home so <br/>
I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll appreciate calls and people visiting her if you&#39;re near <br/>
Columbia.<br/>
<br/>
Hope the rest of the conference is going well. I wish I was there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1335683855">Dear Lisa, et al.,<br/>
<br/>
I am told that Sandra&#39;s surgery went well today.<br/>
<br/>
I gave Ren directions on how to get to the hospital for a visit tonight @ 9 pm. <br/>
The hospital is no more than a mile from the hotel where the conference is <br/>
being held.<br/>
<br/>
I know that Marty has visited.<br/>
<br/>
If Sandra doesn&#39;t bust out before the conference ends @ 4 tomorrow, as she <br/>
has Insisted that she intends to do,  I will be making an announcement <br/>
letting all interested well-wishers know the close proximity of the hospital and <br/>
I am certain that she won&#39;t be wanting for companionship.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I hope that she will stay put and not try to push herself.  She is <br/>
looking at making the return trip home in a few days and ought to be <br/>
concentrating her energy on Recovering rather than worrying over the <br/>
conference.<br/>
<br/>
A brief note on the conference:  I would call it an Enormous Success.  Sandra <br/>
has been missed, no doubt.  She was the reason some attendees made the <br/>
trip.  But the generosity of the other speakers in juggling times to fill in and <br/>
the pure enthusiasm that is generated by the convergence of 150 <br/>
UNschoolers can not be Overstated.<br/>
<br/>
I just wish they would all move in to my neighborhood.  What a cool time we <br/>
would have Every Day.<br/>
<br/>
There is immeasureable comfort in being surrounded by those who &quot;get&quot; <br/>
where you are coming from.<br/>
<br/>
I have been surprised and pleased by the variety of backgrounds the <br/>
attendees represent.  City people and Country people.  Northerners with <br/>
those &quot;funny accents&quot; ;*)  And plenty of Southern drawl-ers. Veteran <br/>
Unschoolers and those just recently converted. Vegans to enthusiastic <br/>
carnivores.  LOTS of Dads!!!!  Yea.  That has been so THRILLING.  To see all <br/>
these guys seeming so comfortable and enthusiastic about their status as <br/>
UNschooling parents.  <br/>
<br/>
The no-age-limit  funshops and presentations have been a rousing success.  <br/>
No one has had to be asked to exit a presentation due to a disruptive little <br/>
person.  The little people have thoroughly enjoyed the funshops designed to <br/>
pique their interest and the tiniest ones have played at the back of the <br/>
speaker rooms with trains, cars, blocks, etc....   happily co-existing with the <br/>
presenters up front.<br/>
<br/>
I know I said a &quot;brief note&quot;.  Can you tell what Great Times we&#39;ve been <br/>
having?  :*)<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry that Sandra has not been able to participate in what I know she <br/>
would have fully delighted in.  I do think she&#39;ll be pleased to know that we all <br/>
carried on and gleaned the best out of the time spent with other like-minded <br/>
souls.  <br/>
<br/>
We are already talking about next year&#39;s conference.<br/>
<br/>
I hope Sandra will be able to join us then.<br/>
<br/>
I hope some of you folks will be able to make it too.<br/>
<br/>
Please do send her your good thoughts and best energy.  I know she&#39;s going <br/>
to need it through her recovery.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll update again as soon as I get word on when she&#39;s headed home.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1080921717">Hi Everyone:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I just got off the phone with Sandra.  They took her off Morphine a few<br/>
hours ago and she&#39;s starting to feel the pain.  She&#39;s suppose to fly<br/>
home Tuesday but is not sure about the flight and not very comfortable<br/>
with the idea of her leg being straight out.  She also said the hotel<br/>
hadn&#39;t fixed the problem.  I asked her if she was going to sue and we<br/>
talked about whether that would be a great learning lesson for the kids<br/>
or just not something she wants to do.  She was disappointed that she<br/>
couldn&#39;t&#39; speak at the conference but very glad that others pulled<br/>
together to make the event a success.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
She said she would be in touch when she gets home as she thinks she&#39;s<br/>
going to move downstairs to where the computer is.  She has to stay off<br/>
her leg for 6 weeks and she&#39;s wondering how&#39;s she&#39;s going to manage<br/>
that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-378948341">Wow, what a thing to go through.  I think as long as the expenses for<br/>
the hospital are paid without a hitch, suing is not pleasant.  Please<br/>
tell Sandra she is in my prayers and thoughts.  Lisa<br/>
