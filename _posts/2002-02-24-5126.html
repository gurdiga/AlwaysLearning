<div id="ygrps-yiv-1098903481">&lt;&lt;There was a Glutton&#39;s eating contest.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Years ago my dh, Eric, decided to be part of a pie-eating contest that <br/>
was held at halftime at a Minnesota Twin�s game. Oops--it�s not called <br/>
halftime in baseball, is it? Maybe it was before the game. Anyway, there <br/>
was a long table set up and about 10 people sat at it with big chocolate <br/>
cream pies in front of each of them.  They were given a pie-server <br/>
(those metal  triangular things with a handle) and the first person to <br/>
shovel in a whole pie won the contest.<br/>
<br/>
Eric started �eating� and ended up cutting the corners of his mouth with <br/>
the server. He suddenly realized he was sitting there before hundreds of <br/>
people acting like a pig and bleeding onto his chocolate pie (the <br/>
whipped cream on top supplied a nice white canvas for the red blood). He <br/>
was disgusted with himself and humiliated and still doesn�t like to <br/>
think about it.<br/>
<br/>
He left for his Australian adventure a couple of days ago, btw. He�s <br/>
driving across the country to L.A. to catch the plane. The morning he <br/>
left he had planned on getting up about 4:30 a.m. and taking off about <br/>
5:30 a.m. We went to bed around midnight and he couldn�t sleep at all. I <br/>
woke up at 1:30 a.m. to find him fully dressed and almost ready to go. <br/>
He drove 15 hours straight that day w/o having slept a wink.  Adrenaline <br/>
kept him going, I guess--that or my will.<br/>
