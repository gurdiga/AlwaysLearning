<div id="ygrps-yiv-1056212980">We went camping to Lake Michigan last weekend.  It was awesome.  We had a small window of sunshine and warmth between the rains on Friday and Monday.  Naturally, 15yo Mr. Cool stayed home.  He left us a message on the cell phone to &quot;check in&quot; which we had not asked him to do, that was nice.  When we got home he told us he was glad we were home, and I think he meant it. Right away he sat down on the sofa to tell us about something he&#39;s really struggling with.  We must be doing something right!<br/>
 <br/>
Occasionally I ask both kids, &quot;what would I have to do to be the perfect mom?&quot;  This is quite a direct route to whatever frustration they are feeling at the moment and so far has produced valuable info each time.  &quot;Don&#39;t kiss me in public.&quot;  &quot;Don&#39;t comment on foods I place into the grocery cart.&quot;  &quot;Keep your nose out of my business!&quot;  As I said, very useful tips.<br/>
 <br/>
Should have seen that 10yo girl of ours chopping firewood, oak no less, with an axe.  She has broad shoulders like her Daddy&#39;s sisters, and is strong as a little bull from climbing trees.  Each morning she styled her hair and freshened her make up.  She opted against bringing her black &quot;go-go boots&quot; with no input from us.<br/>
 <br/>
Actually we camped in the Manistee National Forest.  It&#39;s wilderness camping, no water, elec or even outhouses.  Who wants a nasty outhouse anyway?  Best of all NO ONE was there and it&#39;s free.  It was so deserted we could have walked around nude, hubby said he&#39;d be interested in that!  You don&#39;t say!!<br/>
 <br/>
Husband has been suffering with jock itch.  As we lounged in the dunes watching spectacular Lake Mich, 10 yo dug sand for all her worth and I kept a lookout so he could sun his &quot;gents,&quot; (I think she abbreviated &quot;genitals&#39; - quite appropo) as daughter calls them.  I think it helped.  I told him he looked like a pervert.  We tried to come up with a code word as warning for an approaching person.  &quot;Land ho!&quot; was first, then, &quot;Walking the dog&quot; and then I told him if someone approached I was going to yell, &quot;Cover up your penis!&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Sunday when we woke up we heard a couple of rifle shots far away and were a little dismayed.  I thought it would be awful to be shot with your pants down squatting in the woods.  (As if it wouldn&#39;t be awful any other time!)  Headlines started emerging from our combined sleeping bags, &quot;Rochester woman shot while shitting down&quot;  this from hubby:  &quot;Rochester woman loses left cheek&quot; and my final: &quot;Cheeky Rochester woman loses it.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Mr. Cool&quot;  has been teaching himself web page design.  I remember him sitting through math classes (gr 5-8 the same old shit for four years) pulling his hair, he was so frustrated.  (He decided to start homescool for &quot;gr 9&quot;.)  He got a gig with a company in town and he&#39;s doing an amazing job.  They&#39;ve told him they&#39;ll pay him $75 for it, which is cheap by any standard, but good bucks when you&#39;re 15 and you enjoy the work.  It could be a fabulous referral.<br/>
 <br/>
10yo decided she&#39;s like to be in &quot;6th grade&quot; this year.  All that carefully constructed bullshit the system promotes!  I&#39;m so glad she can see that the emporer is naked....<br/>

I grew up in a very repressive, dysfunctional, germ-phobic, catholic family and had trouble &quot;going&quot; in the woods.  Sunday, when we woke up, we heard a couple of rifle shots far away and were a little dismayed.  I thought it would be awful to be shot with your pants down squatting in the woods.  (As if it wouldn&#39;t be awful any other way!)  Headlines started emerging from our combined sleeping bags, &quot;Rochester woman shot while shitting down&quot;  this from hubby:  &quot;Rochester woman loses left cheek&quot; and my final: &quot;Cheeky Rochester woman loses it.&quot;  If an armed hunter came in sight I&#39;d shit; which would solve the constipation problem in a hurry.  (Rochester, MI is an upscale corner of one of the wealthiest counties in the coutry.  Squatting in the woods is the great equalizer.  The woods is such a fresh perspective on life.)  Gratefully we didn&#39;t see a single snake as that would have been the last time dd set foot near a wood.<br/>

Don&#39;t go pee wearing all brown and green!!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe hang an orange vest up in the tree above you before squatting!<br/>
