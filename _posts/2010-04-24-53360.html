<div id="ygrps-yiv-1452069318">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I feel compelled to write something about all the discussion lately about journalists and the media. <br/>
<br/>
First, a brief background on myself. I am a former newspaper reporter, pre-mommy days. I love the idea of unschooling, but I am still not sure how or if it will eventually fit into my 2-year-old daughter&#39;s life because I co-parent with her father and we are not a couple. <br/>
<br/>
Education was/is very important to both of us. Since I began investigating forms of education, my ideas about how our daughter will/should learn are becoming less mainstream. Her father still holds the same ideas about education that he did before she was born. So we&#39;ll see. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, there have been a lot of angry comments about the media lately on this forum. I don&#39;t doubt that you all have reasons to feel this way. <br/>
<br/>
But there are a few things I want to comment on. This is going to be general because I don&#39;t have time to go back through the thread and find each comment. I keep thinking that it might be useful to all of you who are doing interviews or who are thinking about it, if you could keep an open mind about how the media works and if you could hear from the perspective of a reporter.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, some media outlets go straight for ratings. That is true. More so when you are talking about TV. Print media is generally more fair, I&#39;d say, but they have to keep it short so inevitably, the whole story does not get told in one article.<br/>
<br/>
Also, there will and should always be the other side. A good reporter will/should mention critiques of anything in a story. Especially something that is controversial like unschooling or homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s how the media strives for balance. <br/>
<br/>
But journalists in general do not, or really I should say, ideologically, should not have an &quot;agenda.&quot; I put this word in quotes because I believe I saw it more than once in the the threads on the media. <br/>
<br/>
They are looking for good stories. <br/>
<br/>
Journalists may have their own perspective or hold an opinion on a topic, but in general, I believe that they are curious and open-minded group of folks who are truly interested in new and innovative ideas. It&#39;s one of the reasons they become reporters. (I know unschooling isn&#39;t new, but it is new to many people.) <br/>
<br/>
Someone mentioned in the thread that it was good to stick to talking points. This is only a good idea if you really think that the reporter you are talking to is out for blood. <br/>
<br/>
If I was giving advice, and if anyone is interested in my take on this as a reporter and someone who has worked in the media, I would say this: <br/>
<br/>
Tell your story in as much vivid detail as you can. Have really awesome examples of how unschooling works. Don&#39;t use generalizations. Don&#39;t try to use talking points. Reporters have a nose for a good story, if they are a good reporter. They like details. They like something you can sink your teeth into. Sure, controversy gets ratings, but so do really good stories. <br/>
<br/>
A good example might be of how video games helped a child learn math or problem solving techniques. Or how a trip to the zoo made your child interested in looking up more about a rare species and then spent hours reading books about it. The more detail you give, the better the story. What video game was it? How much time did the child spend on the math or problem? How did you connect the dots when you saw what your child was doing? These are the types of details I&#39;m talking about. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just making this stuff up. I&#39;m sure you all have lots of stories like that. Those are what&#39;s going to catch the interest of a good reporter and those stories will catch the interest of their readers.<br/>
<br/>
Some of you may say that the whole point of unschooling is exactly the opposite of what I&#39;m talking about, that you don&#39;t want or need to quantify how your child is learning. I know this is true. But you could think of it as just a way to learn for yourself how to tell a better story. How to really observe the links between daily life and unschooling. It&#39;s also fun to write/tell stories with lots of vivid details. <br/>
<br/>
A good reporter can also tell when someone is holding back and that&#39;s when they start digging. Don&#39;t give them a reason to dig. What are trying to hide? Fear? What are you afraid of? They will want to know that too.<br/>
<br/>
For what it&#39;s worth. That&#39;s my take on the media. I don&#39;t think unschoolers should hold back and hide unschooling because they fear the media or they are afraid it will get twisted. The more you talk about it, the more mainstream it will become and maybe someday it will be the norm. Wouldn&#39;t that be wonderful?<br/>
<br/>
Sure, you are going to run into reporters who are dumb, lazy, out for blood, tired or simply don&#39;t care. Look for the good ones, give them your stories and watch people&#39;s interest grow. Don&#39;t be afraid of the media. <br/>
<br/>
Just because someone says something negative about unschooling in an article or on a news report doesn&#39;t mean that everyone reading or watching will believe that side. There are plenty of people who will only hear the good stuff and will sit back and say, &quot;Hmmm, that sounds interesting. I&#39;ve never heard of unschooling. Maybe I&#39;ll go read more about it online.&quot; Then they come across Sandra&#39;s website or this group or other groups and find out more about it, like I did. <br/>
<br/>
Another thing, if it wasn&#39;t for my reporter instincts, I never would have bothered to check out unschooling. I would have just dismissed it. <br/>
<br/>
Best, Martha <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
-=-Sure, you are going to run into reporters who are dumb, lazy, out  <br/>
for blood, tired or simply don&#39;t care. Look for the good ones, give  <br/>
them your stories and watch people&#39;s interest grow. Don&#39;t be afraid of  <br/>
the media. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Because unschoolers have nothing to sell or advertise--conferences  <br/>
aren&#39;t for the general public--we don&#39;t look for reporters.<br/>
<br/>
It can take someone who really wants to understand at least a year to  <br/>
get a good glimmer of confident, direct insight.  Some people get it  <br/>
sooner.  Some people take more than two years.   No journalist is  <br/>
going to get it even with a full day or two of &quot;exposure.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been interviewed for newspapers, magazines, radio and TV.  So  <br/>
have many other unschoolers I know, and some I didn&#39;t know  <br/>
personally.   It&#39;s true that print media tends to be less crazed, but  <br/>
they have a formula for &quot;balance.&quot;  It isn&#39;t balance.  It&#39;s they set  <br/>
you up and then let two &quot;experts&quot; each throw a knife at you.  You  <br/>
don&#39;t get to respond.  That&#39;s not debate, without a rebuttal.<br/>
<br/>
No unschooling story starts with school&#39;s opinion and then lets  <br/>
unschoolers be the &quot;experts&quot; who get the last word.<br/>
<br/>
Of the dozen &quot;experts&quot; who have been quoted to refute the information  <br/>
I took an hour or three of my own life and time to provide, not one  <br/>
single one--not one--knew about unschooling before the reporter asked  <br/>
them what they thought of it.  One, on a TV article in Albuquerque  <br/>
even SAID, and they left it in, &quot;I&#39;ve never heard of that, but...&quot;    <br/>
And they didn&#39;t show her the footage they had of me, either.  They  <br/>
just asked her cold.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not balance.  That&#39;s dismissal.<br/>
<br/>
I have a few handy.  I&#39;m not going to re-read to see if they followed  <br/>
the formula exactly, but these are the three easiest to get to.  One  <br/>
is Ren Allen&#39;s family; one is my daughter Holly, with quotes by me,  <br/>
Roya Sorooshian and Brenna McBroom; one had the potential to be better  <br/>
but isn&#39;t too bad.  It was a weekly unschooling gathering at my house  <br/>
years ago.  A reporter, sound tech and camerman, all really interested  <br/>
and friendly.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No doubt the GMA folks have an agenda and they&#39;re looking for &quot;good stories&quot;<br/>
to back that up. Showing out-of-mainstream folks as irresponsible parents<br/>
does just that for them. We&#39;ll be seeing a platform for more homeschooling<br/>
regulations pop-up soon, I don&#39;t doubt. Part of their &quot;become a sheep&quot;<br/>
agenda.<br/>

information about the very cool things their children do - with and without<br/>
their parents.  Instead, the editors decided to focus only on television<br/>
watching and fried-food eating.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been interviewed a bunch of times - tv, radio, video, magazines, <br/>
newspapers. I was interviewed just last week by a magazine reporter. She <br/>
asked really lame questions that didn&#39;t at all get to the heart of <br/>
unschooling. I tried to give her more depth than the very superficial <br/>
questions she was asking, but when I&#39;d do that, she&#39;d go back to her <br/>
pre-set list of questions and ask another lame one. It felt like casting <br/>
pearls before swine.<br/>
<br/>
I will usually only do live interview shows, not shows where they follow <br/>
my family around and film and then, later, add on the voice of the <br/>
journalist telling about us, with carefully and very selectively chosen <br/>
bits. I do print interviews, but I&#39;m really aware of what I say, <br/>
thinking of how it might sound if used out of context.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra&#39;s family and my family were all together once, some years ago. <br/>
There was a Berkeley grad student who was making a documentary about <br/>
unschooling and he was interviewing Sandra, in my living room. There <br/>
were SIX or more unschooled kids watching as Sandra talked ABOUT them. <br/>
Multiple times she tried to tell the guy he should interview the kids, <br/>
themselves, let them speak for themselves. He just flat-out refused. He <br/>
had a plan, already, and that wasn&#39;t in his plans.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure why we&#39;re DOING interviews. This isn&#39;t my religion and I&#39;m <br/>
not getting into heaven by bringing more souls to see the unschooling <br/>
light! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, if homeschooling interviews are good, there might be <br/>
kids out there who are rescued from misery and even danger, in schools. <br/>
But we don&#39;t have to promote unschooling for that...people who get their <br/>
kids out of school and start homeschooling are fairly likely, these <br/>
days, to run into the idea of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
The radical unschooling publicity could put us at risk for bringing down <br/>
regulation on our heads - there is that possibility to consider.<br/>

<br/>
Interpretation is everything.  Anger?  hmmm, I&#39;m not so sure.   Frustration maybe.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Journalists may have their own perspective or hold an opinion on a topic, but in general, I believe that they are curious and open-minded group of folks who are truly interested in new and innovative ideas. It&#39;s one of the reasons they become reporters. (I know unschooling isn&#39;t new, but it is new to many people.) &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Did you see the GMA botch job?  They did not even remotely seem genuinely curious or open minded about unschooling.  They went straight to sensationalism, that WAS their agenda!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Some of you may say that the whole point of unschooling is exactly the opposite of what I&#39;m talking about, that you don&#39;t want or need to quantify how your child is learning. I know this is true. But you could think of it as just a way to learn for yourself how to tell a better story. How to really observe the links between daily life and unschooling. It&#39;s also fun to write/tell stories with lots of vivid details. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Do you think that all of those that have been reading and writing and talking about unschooling for years don&#39;t do these things already?  The problem that happened with the GMA news story didn&#39;t have ANYthing to do with this.  It was completely and totally biased, edited for sensationalist responses, which they got.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t think unschoolers should hold back and hide unschooling because they fear the media or they are afraid it will get twisted. The more you talk about it, the more mainstream it will become and maybe someday it will be the norm. Wouldn&#39;t that be wonderful?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
While, ideally I agree with this.  That is NOT what has happened time and time again with the media, in regards to unschooling.  Like you said, it isn&#39;t new.  There have been plenty of reporters and others within the media that have done expose&#39;s on unschooling.  Some of them have resulted in more people coming to understand unschooling.  The truly terrible ones like the recent one, are the kind that do more harm than good, even if some good comes out of it for a handful.<br/>

<br/>
You know how unschoolers become annoyed when some asshole who is too lazy to send his kids to school and too lazy to help them learn says they are unschooling? It gives unschoolers a bad name. <br/>
<br/>
Well, I become annoyed when I hear people trashing the entire media based upon one 10 minute segment with a couple of talking heads who probably got their jobs based on the lush quality of their hair or their political connections. <br/>

Not all reporters have an agenda. Not all of them are biased. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re right. You don&#39;t need to subject yourself to idiots in order to reach out to the rest of the world. If someone asks you for an interview and you are tempted to accept, do some research. If you are unfamiliar with their work, look it up. Make an informed decision. <br/>
<br/>
Nobody forced that family to give an interview. I don&#39;t watch GMA regularly, but I have watched it many times over the years. It doesn&#39;t take much exposure to that show to know that they try to sensationalize all their stories and they generally give personal commentary on the stories, which I agree is totally biased reporting. Unfortunately, most people don&#39;t understand that behavior is not at the core of the values and principles of good and honest reporters. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>--&quot;I&#39;m not sure why we&#39;re DOING interviews. This isn&#39;t my religion and I&#39;m <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; not getting into heaven by bringing more souls to see the unschooling <br/>
&gt; light! &lt;G&gt;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>--LOL, right. There&#39;s no incentive for unschoolers to promote unschooling. But like Sandra said, if a reporter wants to interview an unschooler, they are likely to find a candidate. Better for it to be a responsible and intelligent one instead of an idiot.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;On the other hand, if homeschooling interviews are good, there might be <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; kids out there who are rescued from misery and even danger, in schools. <br/>
&gt; But we don&#39;t have to promote unschooling for that...people who get their <br/>
&gt; kids out of school and start homeschooling are fairly likely, these <br/>
&gt; days, to run into the idea of unschooling.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The radical unschooling publicity could put us at risk for bringing down <br/>
&gt; regulation on our heads - there is that possibility to consider.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep, that possibility is very likely, especially as unschooling grows in popularity. It is, I would guess, almost inevitable. <br/>

<br/>
-- Yep, I totally agree. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Do you think that all of those that have been reading and writing and talking about unschooling for years don&#39;t do these things already?  The problem that happened with the GMA news story didn&#39;t have ANYthing to do with this.  It was completely and totally biased, edited for sensationalist responses, which they got.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-- I know that the unschoolers who are giving interviews do this stuff. I was writing that in response to the person who was giving the advice of using talking points and trying to control the interview. I should have more explicit. I was pressed for time and now I wish I had searched the posts and responded directly to that one. It just kept sticking in my head as I read these posts about that interview. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;While, ideally I agree with this.  That is NOT what has happened time and time again with the media, in regards to unschooling.  Like you said, it isn&#39;t new.  There have been plenty of reporters and others within the media that have done expose&#39;s on unschooling.  Some of them have resulted in more people coming to understand unschooling.  The truly terrible ones like the recent one, are the kind that do more harm than good, even if some good comes out of it for a handful.<br/>
<br/>
-- I disagree. The reason unschooling is growing in number is because more and more people are finding it. And yes, a lot of people are learning about it by way of the &quot;biased, agenda-setting&quot; media.  <br/>
<br/>
The reason unschooling got prominently featured on an extremely popular, mainstream morning show is because more and more people are showing interest in it. If nobody was talking about it and the number of unschoolers wasn&#39;t growing, you can be damn sure GMA wouldn&#39;t have bothered to do a story about it.<br/>

It&#39;s a shame that happened to you. But I think that your lesson is a bit over the top. That&#39;s like saying that you ate out once and got food poisoning so you&#39;ll never eat out again because all food prepared in restaurants will poison you. Or that you went to a movie once and there was a scene you thought was poorly acted so there must not be any good actors anywhere and you will never go to the movies again. <br/>
<br/>
My point here is that the media, just like everything else in this world has good aspects and bad aspects. It&#39;s unfortunate that so many people only see the negativity surrounding the media.<br/>
<br/>
Without the media we never would have found out that Richard Nixon was a criminal. Without the media we wouldn&#39;t have been able to watch 9-11 as it unfolded. Without the media we wouldn&#39;t all have the image of O.J. Simpson&#39;s white Ford Bronco being chased down the highway forever burned into our brains. <br/>
<br/>
Obviously I can continue with these examples forever and a day. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m passionate about this. I love the media, even with its obvious problems. I love news. I love stories. I love being able to find out information at the push of a button, at the flip of a paper, at the click of a mouse. Is all that information always good, unbiased, solid reporting? No, a large percentage of it is pure crap. <br/>
<br/>
But we as readers and watchers (and sometimes interviewees) can lump it all together and love it all or hate it all. OR, we can be discriminating in what we watch and read and comment on. We can become informed and help inform. <br/>

<br/>
Are you saying that I am defensive, shrill and unfair? <br/>
<br/>
If people are rushing to defend schools and school children, then they must be worried that unschooling will become more popular, therefore taking away something precious to them. Why do you think they are rushing to defend? Is it unfair of them to want to defend schools? <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see how you can read shrillness into writing, unless I was using a lot of capitalized words or lots and lots of exclamation points. Shrillness is something you hear in someone&#39;s voice. If there&#39;s no voice, then, well, it&#39;s in your own head. I think that you might be reading something into my writing based on the amount of stress you&#39;ve had this week. I promise, I am not being shrill. I am not feeling defensive. And I&#39;m sorry if you think I am being unfair.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not a big fan of schooling. I have absolutely zero good memories of school. School caused ridiculous amounts of anxiety for me when I was growing up. I can&#39;t imagine anyone wanting to go to school. And yet, some kids do. Does this make them bad or wrong, in your opinion? Maybe it&#39;s okay to have both schools and unschooling. <br/>

A perfect example is the one that Marina just posted a little while ago. And my whole point is that the media is made up of varying degrees, just like any other part of life. <br/>
#2. Bad is subjective. I thought the articles on your website were all pretty decent. The first one was the best and the last one, well, okay, that one was bordering on bad, it certainly wasn&#39;t great. But I&#39;m sure that you have seen way more coverage of unschooling than I have. And I have no doubt that much of it was &quot;bad.&quot; But I&#39;d bet that some of it was good too. <br/>

I really didn&#39;t mean for this to turn into a argument. I usually keep my mouth shut when I hear sweeping comments about the media. I thought this group might be open enough to hear another perspective. I also thought some of my knowledge might come in handy for some of you. I like unschoolers. I like unschooling. I also like the media. <br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I realize I&#39;m in the minority when it comes to my opinion on the  <br/>
&gt; media.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think you&#39;re mistaking ideals with reality.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with you that the ideal journalist wants to dig for the story  <br/>
and present it in a balanced way, but the truth is that news  <br/>
management needs to do better than their competitors at grabbing  <br/>
people&#39;s attention. And that overrides ideals and molds stories and  <br/>
how reporters produce them.<br/>
<br/>
The same with teachers. I&#39;m sure most people go into the profession  <br/>
with a love of helping kids learn. The reality is they are stuck in a  <br/>
system that needs them to force feed a specific set of information in  <br/>
a specific allotted time. The goal they must meet isn&#39;t about learning  <br/>
at all but about the statistics they can produce to show how well  <br/>
they&#39;re meeting the school&#39;s agenda. The ideal teacher is irrelevant  <br/>
to a child&#39;s experience with a real teacher constricted by meeting the  <br/>
goals that ensure she keeps her job.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me you&#39;re doing exactly what you&#39;re saying others are  <br/>
accusing the journalists who report on unschooling of doing: you&#39;re  <br/>
interjecting yourself and your agenda (to defend journalistic ideals)  <br/>
into this &quot;story&quot; and not really hearing and digging beneath what  <br/>
people are saying ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I thought this group might be open enough to hear another  <br/>
&gt; perspective.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As in most discussions with two different points, people tend to read  <br/>
to see if others agree and miss what *else* is being said. I suspect  <br/>
most people *did* get your point about journalists in your first post.  <br/>
You&#39;re reading for &quot;Yes, I agree&quot; and missing that people *are*  <br/>
agreeing but following it with a &quot;but&quot; which makes it feel like  <br/>
they&#39;re missing your point. The point for this list is what&#39;s relevant  <br/>
to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Whether ideal journalists are awesome at their job is irrelevant to  <br/>
the more important point that unschoolers have rarely encountered the  <br/>
ideal. Doesn&#39;t your journalistic instinct see a story in that? Don&#39;t  <br/>
you want to know why? You&#39;re expending your thoughts and words  <br/>
defending what should be and missing how and why reality is different.  <br/>
The real issue, since this is an unschooling list, is that unschoolers  <br/>
need to be aware of how they&#39;re likely to be portrayed by the media  <br/>
because more often than not unschoolers have been burned.<br/>
<br/>
For unschoolers the issue isn&#39;t the ideals of journalism but how the  <br/>
realities of journalism will likely affect them. The important points  <br/>
are:<br/>
<br/>
1) Grabbing the audience attention gets in the way of objectivity and  <br/>
truth. No matter how clear they are, the reporter needs to write  <br/>
something that will grab the audience&#39;s attention.<br/>
<br/>
2) Unschooling is difficult to understand for parents who are spending  <br/>
hours a week investigating. It can, as Sandra pointed out, typically  <br/>
take a year. No journalist can understand unschooling in the short  <br/>
amount of time they&#39;re given to produce a story. Asking questions  <br/>
isn&#39;t enough when the journalist doesn&#39;t realize the foundation they  <br/>
assume is beneath the topic they&#39;re investigating needs thrown out.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, to understand homeschooling, people only need to throw  <br/>
out part of the foundation: that kids don&#39;t need the &quot;administrator of  <br/>
the curriculum&quot; to be an expert when there are only a few kids.  <br/>
Homeschooling can be seen as schooling with a lot more flexibility.  <br/>
(But even that took years before journalists approached it from that  <br/>
point of view.)<br/>
<br/>
But to get unschooling, pretty much the entire foundation needs  <br/>
scrapped. As just a *piece* of what needs thrown out, it&#39;s  <br/>
unreasonable to expect a reporter to question their knowledge that  <br/>
math needs poured into kids in a specific way and to grasp that  <br/>
building an understanding of how numbers work through video games and  <br/>
living life not only works but works better. The two approaches don&#39;t  <br/>
end up in the same place. An unschooled child will appear ignorant of  <br/>
math next to a schooled child and yet the unschooled child will truly  <br/>
get what they&#39;re doing when they manipulate numbers. That&#39;s because  <br/>
the schooled child&#39;s goal is usually a good grade. An unschooled child  <br/>
needs the answer to make life work (get to the next level, save up to  <br/>
buy a toy).<br/>
<br/>
To get unschooling, someone needs to question *everything* they  <br/>
believe about learning, education, teaching. If the reporter doesn&#39;t  <br/>
understand, they can&#39;t ask the right questions. I&#39;ve been writing  <br/>
about unschooling for nearly 15 years, trying to explain it to brand  <br/>
new people and I still don&#39;t have a way of getting people who are  <br/>
eager to grasp unschooling to realize they need to clear the  <br/>
foundation to build a new understanding on. It&#39;s unreasonable to  <br/>
expect a reporter who doesn&#39;t realize they need to do that to form an  <br/>
accurate picture of unschooling. It&#39;s unreasonable to expect a  <br/>
reporter who *does* realize they need to clear the foundation to then  <br/>
be able to do that for their readers.<br/>

&gt; food poisoning so you&#39;ll never eat out again<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah - if it was only once, it would be a lame generalization. But some <br/>
of us have done this over and over.<br/>
<br/>
Based on my own experience, and I have a significant amount of it <br/>
related to unschooling, anyway, the &quot;reporters&quot; who contact us most <br/>
often have a preconceived idea of what their story is going to be, and <br/>
they fit whatever we say into it.<br/>
<br/>
Even the very very BEST of them do this weird &quot;balancing&quot; thing that is <br/>
not balancing at all. They interview a bunch of &quot;moms&quot; - make us sound a <br/>
little dreamy or silly with a &quot;can you believe she said that?&quot; attitude. <br/>
THen they ALWAYS, and I mean ALWAYS, go to some talking head expert who <br/>
has some university degree in education, who has never met an <br/>
unschooling family, never read a single word about it, for a refutation. <br/>
The article always has some stupid quote from the (not) expert saying <br/>
something like, &quot;Children need structure and unschooling is not going to <br/>
provide for their social needs.&quot; The reporter NEVER, not one single time <br/>
in the dozens of times I&#39;ve been involved, asks the expert what makes <br/>
them an expert on this?<br/>
<br/>
In fact, when the so-called expert says something like, &quot;I don&#39;t have <br/>
any expertise on this. Never heard of it.&quot; the so-called journalist <br/>
ignores that and asks things like, &quot;Well, IF a child didn&#39;t do any kind <br/>
of school, wasn&#39;t taught anything, was just left alone to learn all on <br/>
their own, what would you think of that?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is NOT an isolated case, this is not how it sometimes goes. This is <br/>
how it almost always goes.<br/>
<br/>
We do them anyway - even though we KNOW we&#39;re going to have to cringe <br/>
reading the article - because sometimes people are intrigued enough by <br/>
what quotes they DO use from us, that they look into it for themselves, <br/>
ignoring the so-called expert. Usually these are people who are already <br/>
very fed up with the education experts.<br/>
<br/>
But it is a case of hoping what is offered won&#39;t be SO bad that it makes <br/>
us look so dangerous to our kids that we bring down the wrath of some <br/>
legislator who thinks he needs to put a STOP to our neglect of our <br/>
children&#39;s education before our kids end up unsocialized, dangerous <br/>
adults living on public welfare.<br/>

<br/>
A few weeks ago I started looking more seriously into unschooling. I joined<br/>
this list and some others, and last Saturday I received Sandra&#39;s book and<br/>
started reading. It was really odd that Monday morning my mom called me to tell<br/>
me that there was going to be a segment on GMA about unschooling (she saw me<br/>
reading the book). I thought maybe she misunderstood (I mean, what a<br/>
coincidence!) but sure enough, I set my DVR, and when I got home later in the<br/>
day I watched it. Thank goodness I was reading the book and following comments<br/>
on the list, because I think that perhaps if I hadn&#39;t, the bias of the program<br/>
would have made it much easier for me to discount unschooling as a viable<br/>
option. It has been a roller coaster week for me (and I&#39;m sure many others)<br/>
because of the media coverage of unschooling. It&#39;s hard enough to be a<br/>
homeschooler at times, and this week seeing unschoolers portrayed so negatively<br/>
has really caused me to think long and hard about<br/>
the decision to unschool. It is definitely not the easy road, but as I read<br/>
these posts I am encouraged to continue reading and investigating and watching<br/>
it unfold. Thank you Joyce for your last post...it is so helpful for those of<br/>
us who are newer to unschooling to hear the voices of those who have been living<br/>
and writing about it for so long. It means a ton.<br/>

on this one segment. This one segment is just the most recent of a <br/>
zillion of them - this one with a lot more viewers and therefore a lot <br/>
more dangerous to our way of life.<br/>
<br/>
This may be &quot;just journalism&quot; to you, but I have three daughters who <br/>
want to raise their own children as unschoolers, too, and I want them to <br/>
be able to do it as openly and happily as we did. Hatchet-jobs like the <br/>
GMA segment put them at risk, too much risk, imo.<br/>
<br/>
Christine and Phil and their kids are marvelous and I know they would <br/>
have shown those reporters what a wonderful, engaging, enriched and <br/>
stimulating environment their children experience. I know their kids <br/>
would have been wonderful examples of unschoolers. I know they felt that <br/>
what would come out of this would be good - would offer an alternative <br/>
to people looking for one. I&#39;m sure they figured there would be the <br/>
usually idiotic &quot;balance&quot; added, but I doubt very much that they <br/>
expected that the segment itself would be so terrible. I don&#39;t want <br/>
Christine and Phil to feel bad about this at all.<br/>
<br/>
But this segment put our freedoms at risk - especially in some states <br/>
where unschoolers are barely skimming under the radar already.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve accepted the fact that they will always find someone willing to <br/>
do it - someone with super good intentions - someone who figures this <br/>
time it will go well. So, when I am contacted, I usually try to help <br/>
best I can, try to make it as good as possible, knwing that there is <br/>
always a risk.<br/>
<br/>
I know someone who had their family featured on a tv show, too, They&#39;re <br/>
not total unschoolers, but hands-on, experiential-learning, very <br/>
unschool-ish seeming homeschoolers. One of her sons is a bookish kind of <br/>
kid - reads ALL the time. The day they filmed, there were hours that he <br/>
sat around and waited for things to happen, always reading. On the show, <br/>
they made it seem like he didn&#39;t even know HOW to read.<br/>
<br/>
I was interviewed by a well-known evening news show. It was me, my <br/>
daughter, a homeschooling dad, and his son. The questions were decent, <br/>
the reporters seemed intelligent and interested. There was a lot of time <br/>
for chatting in between actually filming and the reporter used what we <br/>
chatted about to form his questions - so they weren&#39;t just <br/>
pre-determined questions written by someone who really knew so little <br/>
that he didn&#39;t know what to ask (the usual kinds of questions we get). I <br/>
felt really good about the interview.<br/>
<br/>
When it aired - I GASPED out loud. They did a little promo of it before <br/>
the commercial break. The PROMO showed my daughter and Matthew and said, <br/>
&quot;Rose and Matthew don&#39;t go to school, but their standardized test scores <br/>
are very high. How can this be?&quot; (I have the words slightly wrong - but <br/>
that&#39;s the gist of it.)<br/>
<br/>
WHAT THE HECK? We&#39;d told him we don&#39;t test. That was a POINT made and <br/>
discussed. Rosie and Matthew, neither of whom ever went to school or had <br/>
ANY school-at-home of any kind, had most definitely never taken any <br/>
standardized test. So not only did the NEWS reporters make up that they <br/>
tested , they made up that they scored high.<br/>
<br/>
It was an overall unusually positive piece - the interviewer was pretty <br/>
intrigued and it showed. He took a &quot;Wow - this is really suprising that <br/>
people are successfully doing this&quot; tone - which beats the heck out of a <br/>
&quot;Look at these weirdos and shouldn&#39;t the government step in to protect <br/>
these children &quot; tone. I am a college professor and so is Dan - and we <br/>
were being interviewed AT the college where he teaches. We got some <br/>
respect as &quot;professional educators.&quot; This was THE most positive piece <br/>
I&#39;ve seen on unschooling, but they didn&#39;t even get their facts, very <br/>
specific facts that we&#39;d discussed, right.<br/>

What this list is for is providing an opportunity to discuss  <br/>

It&#39;s not journalism.  It&#39;s not &quot;media&quot; in the sense that it is not  <br/>

democratization of media.&quot; I&#39;ve been writing all my life without<br/>
being a journalist. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The invention of the printing press also gave an audience to all sorts of<br/>
reformers or people spreading new ideas.  But with the internet I share<br/>
information with less effort than anyone could historically.  I am<br/>
broadening my understanding of media to include the internet as a means<br/>
ordinary people share information.  For ordinary people getting access to a<br/>
printing press was expensive, photocopiers changed things for small<br/>
newletters, but the internet made more information available to more people<br/>
and they can go looking for information day or night.  Nobody waits.<br/>
<br/>
I am not implying you need to be a journalist to have opinions--just that<br/>
reaching an audience has become easier.  I like the idea of people having<br/>
online dialogues--we can come to clearer understandings.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I had a<br/>
philosophy publication called ThinkWell for many years, and you seem<br/>
to be suggesting that computers, and twitter, have opened up the world<br/>
for me.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t suggesting you in particular--but there are people in Switzerland,<br/>
and France and Canada on this list and there are many lists.  Anyone can<br/>
find information more easily or share their thoughts.  Without the Internet<br/>
if I wanted to ask you a question I would have to write and mail a letter.<br/>
There are many other people--those ordinary people I connect with online<br/>
whose ideas are similar to mine would never have crossed my path otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;-=-Media not limited by posters, responders and dialogues are<br/>
initiated.-=&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The sentence doesn&#39;t really make much sense;-)<br/>
The way I express opinions and gather information is changing, at least for<br/>
me it has changed radically over the course of my life.  I can read<br/>
something posted by someone in Switzerland seconds after he or she writes<br/>
and sends their opinion to the world.  That is just amazing to me--time,<br/>
space and money used to limit the spread of ideas, as did censorship for<br/>
centuries.<br/>
<br/>
There is more information to view than ever, and I think that helps me to<br/>
revise my thinking.  I don&#39;t have to read about your ideas as filtered in<br/>
the press--I can find your site, or email you.  That may not change things<br/>
for you, but I can have more information first hand faster, than I could if<br/>
I had to board a plane to go to a conference(time and money are hindering<br/>
people from doing that) or wait for a newsletter to appear in my mailbox or<br/>
visit a library or bookstore(who may choose not to stock a particular book).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2031249688">***I really didn&#39;t mean for this to turn into a argument. I usually keep my mouth shut when I hear sweeping comments about the media. I thought this group might be open enough to hear another perspective. I also thought some of my knowledge might come in handy for some of you. I like unschoolers. I like unschooling. I also like the media. ***<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers are the least likely to make sweeping arguments about anything, media included.  What mostly happens in media, in regards to unschooling, is like what happened to Marina when she did an interview about breast feeding, something completely normal and good, and they turned it into something weird with a disturbing slant.  I&#39;ve also seen some fairly decent things written about unschooling in the media, but they completely missed the point of it, like doing a story about breast feeding with the assumption that baby formula is better, and then showing an extreme option of using human milk as if it&#39;s somehow abnormal.<br/>
<br/>
Most people believe that school is THE be all end all to human enlightenment, that without it, all society will break down and kids will grow up to be huge losers that all hard working people will need to support.  Any time, any thing that counters that, gets put into the news, it&#39;s going to be viewed with that lens either by the media, by the viewers, or both.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to be visiting a friend from Germany today.  I used to live with him in college and we&#39;ve maintained a friendship.  He&#39;s never liked the idea of homeschooling even though he likes me and my family.  He just had a baby.  Even if I managed to change his mind, he still wouldn&#39;t be able to homeschool his child unless his partner agreed and they moved out of the country.  I doubt he watched the GMA thing, but if he did, he&#39;d be in the segment of the population that would see sensationalist journalism for what it is, but he&#39;d probably STILL agree with it.  He&#39;s a very intelligent person.  That news segment didn&#39;t have an audience of people like him, their audience was one that LIKES sensationalist news pieces.  It has about 1000 comments, mostly negative, I haven&#39;t read most of them or even tried to keep up with them.  <br/>
<br/>
What bothers me, is the family that offered themselves up, was a really great unschooling example.  I think I&#39;d be booed off.  My house isn&#39;t nearly as nice or clean as theirs, my husband and I don&#39;t have the same quality of careers as those parents, and my oldest doesn&#39;t look like your average kid.  I&#39;d be made to look like a nut job for sure!<br/>

Martha - you might want to go to a conference where you can actually <br/>

who are amazingly articulate. We always have teen panels - the audience <br/>
asks them questions about their unschooling lives. Some of them are as <br/>
young as 11 or 12. The HSC conference in Sacramento has had kids panels <br/>
the last couple of years - that was younger children - 8 to 12 years <br/>
old. The audience is mostly adults who ask lots of questions. The kids <br/>
are great - so articulate! The kid and teen panels are super super <br/>

unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
My family and I attended Good Vibrations last year in San Diego.  We had a blast and spent most of our time in funshops, hanging out, and swimming in the pool.  I didn&#39;t get to see many talks except the wonderful teen panel.<br/>
<br/>
Two weeks ago my 20 month old son accidentally poked me in the eye resulting in an ER visit and blindness in both eyes for a week.  Long story short, my husband hooked me up to the computer to listen to the sound files from Good Vibrations each night as I nursed my son to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
Roya&#39;s talk was such a treat.  I highly recommend it and found it to be what I think would seal the deal for any &quot;on the fence&quot; unschooler.<br/>

ANY school-at-home of any kind, had most definitely never taken any<br/>
standardized test. So not only did the NEWS reporters make up that they<br/>
tested , they made up that they scored high.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Obviously the reporter padded the story to appeal to school<br/>
sensibilities so that it would have credibility with the general<br/>
audience. :/  I don&#39;t approve but I understand why it was done.<br/>

I think once reporters turn things in, editors and directors add the  <br/>
titles and blurbs and so the edges end up being written by people who  <br/>
weren&#39;t even at the interviews.   So it goes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-847486875">&lt;&lt;&lt;What mostly happens in media, in regards to unschooling, is like what<br/>
happened to Marina when she did an interview about breast feeding, something<br/>
completely normal and good, and they turned it into something weird with a<br/>
disturbing slant. I&#39;ve also seen some fairly decent things written about<br/>
unschooling in the media, but they completely missed the point of it, like<br/>
doing a story about breast feeding with the assumption that baby formula is<br/>
better, and then showing an extreme option of using human milk as if it&#39;s<br/>
somehow abnormal.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I saw a tape of the breastfeeding segment--which someone provided.  A friend<br/>
who is an actor commented to my husband the segment with breastfeeding moms<br/>
kept popping up and was re-run over and over.  The moms were &quot;eye candy&quot;<br/>
with voice overs from a mom we never met and a doctor who said don&#39;t worry<br/>
if breastfeeding &quot;sexually stimulates&quot; you.  Breastfeeding can intensify<br/>
feelings of love for the baby and feel pleasant.  Most of the moms on the<br/>
interview reported feeling dopey when breastfeeding, feeling love, or<br/>
pain--with the main message being be persistent because it is worth it.<br/>
Obviously, they appeared to help &quot;normalize&quot; the idea of nursing--there<br/>
were  two doulas, a midwife and a nurse amoung the circle.  None of their<br/>
comments were used--but their faces were used with voice overs and<br/>
juxtaposed with the doctor&#39;s voice talking about orgasm during breastfeeding<br/>
being normal.  Its too bad because the moms were an articulate bunch who<br/>
appeared to help other moms--their intention wasn&#39;t to look foolish or<br/>
perverted or fame.<br/>
<br/>
Those women were all angry because their experiences were not shared as they<br/>
intended.  One of the moms owned a small production company and offered to<br/>
reshoot everything and sell it as a documentary--giving the moms a chance to<br/>
approve the final cut.  She was really mad about what happened--but nobody<br/>
wanted to appear in her breastfeeding documentary because they&#39;d already<br/>
been disillusioned.<br/>
