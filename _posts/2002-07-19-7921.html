disorienting to the teacher.<br/>

any time I wasn&#39;t in school.  I remember jumping in the backs of trucks<br/>
with people I didn&#39;t know if I&#39;d walked out the old cemetery road to pick<br/>
apples, and they would drop me at my corner and I would wander on home.  <br/>

live in a small town where the biggest crime is maybe a bar fight, or<br/>
illegal fireworks. <br/>
