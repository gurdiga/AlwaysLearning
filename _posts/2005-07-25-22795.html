Don&#39;t worry - you&#39;re not a failure<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
July 21, 2005 14:23 <br/>
<br/>
THERE&#39;S good news today for anyone who&#39;s ever failed an exam at school - it&#39;s not that bad, just a &quot;deferred success.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the view of a former Suffolk teacher who wants to ban the word fail from schools.<br/>
<br/>
Liz Beattie, who has 37 years of teaching experience, said she believes children who are told they have failed can be crushed by the experience.<br/>
<br/>
Now she&#39;s proposing that the word &quot;fail&quot; is replaced by the concept of &quot;deferred success&quot; in the educational vocabulary.<br/>
<br/>
Her motion to the annual conference of the Professional Association of Teachers reads: &quot;Conference believes it is time to delete the word &#39;fail&#39; from the educational vocabulary to be replaced with the concept of deferred success.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Mrs Beattie, 68, will put the motion, which will be seconded by a colleague from Yorkshire, on July 28.<br/>
<br/>
She said: &quot;Failure is very hard to cope with. Eventually, if you experience enough of it, it stops you in your tracks.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Education is too important for that - we need to keep people striving on. I&#39;ve always thought that, educationally, it was a good thing to get rid of total pass or total fail.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Learning should be life-long and it should be something that everybody knows they can do and knows they can have a bash at.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We&#39;re not helping it. They are still talking pass and fail and it&#39;s a very depressing thing to deal with.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Mrs Beattie, who lives in Ipswich, continued: &quot;I&#39;d rather tell kids that they have done jolly well, they worked really well, they have achieved that and that&#39;s brilliant.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You can then say tomorrow we should try that - rather than just saying you&#39;ve failed.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I think we all need to succeed at something. You need encouragement rather than being told you haven&#39;t done very well.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If the motion is passed at the conference, PAT&#39;s ruling council will decide how it should inform the association&#39;s policy, which currently states that &quot;all individual achievement should be recognised.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Mrs Beattie, PAT Suffolk Federation Secretary and field officer, said she would not totally rule out ever using the word in education - but stressed encouragement was the key.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I think it can stop children in their tracks,&quot; she added. &quot;In a way we all deal with failure, but if it stops us trying something that is terrible.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s an attitude of mind. I would not say never tell them that they (pupils) haven&#39;t managed something but we&#39;ve all got to strive. It&#39;s a case of getting the balance right.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I would be surprised if we didn&#39;t get the motion through because I think there are enough teachers at all levels who know that, with little ones, you&#39;ve got to get them motivated and with the older ones you&#39;ve got to give them confidence going into exams.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I feel very strongly about the idea. It&#39;s a thing that has always coloured the way I taught.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
She&#39;s right. Except she hasn&#39;t gone far enough.<br/>
<br/>
Schools are set up as assembly lines. Kids have to succeed at <br/>
one thing before they can move onto the next.<br/>
<br/>
A teacher can allow a child to &quot;defer success&quot; on some things.  <br/>
For instance, a child doesn&#39;t need to know how to write an &quot;A&quot; to <br/>
write a &quot;B&quot;. But at some point the curriculum is based on <br/>
understanding what was explained before. *In school* a child <br/>
can&#39;t &quot;defer success&quot; in reading until they&#39;re 11. For one thing, a <br/>
school can&#39;t erase the child&#39;s understanding that they can&#39;t do <br/>
what (feels like) everyone else can. For another thing, the <br/>
curriculum requires that children be reading independly by 4th <br/>
grade. If they aren&#39;t, they need &quot;special help&quot; (e.g., help that&#39;s <br/>
reserved for the dumb kids.)<br/>
<br/>
The system is set up to run on success and correcting failure. <br/>
That system can&#39;t be erased by replacing the word failure with <br/>
the phrase &quot;defered success&quot;. That&#39;s double speak. The whole <br/>
system needs to be scrapped and replaced with unschooling :-)<br/>

After quickly learning how important words are to this group, I <br/>
couldn&#39;t help<br/>
but think of you all when I read this article. What do you think about <br/>
it?<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eveningstar.co.uk/content/news/NewsStory.asp?Brand=ESTOnline&Category=News&ItemId=IPED19+Jul+2005+09:29:27:297">http://www.eveningstar.co.uk/content/news/NewsStory.asp?Brand=ESTOnline&Category=News&ItemId=IPED19+Jul+2005+09:29:27:297</a><br/>

<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Removing the word &quot;failure&quot; from the school vocabulary wouldn&#39;t change <br/>
the fact that the child hasn&#39;t lived up to the standard.<br/>
<br/>
What used to be &quot;the dumb group&quot; or &quot;the blue group&quot; is now &quot;special <br/>
ed&quot;---does that change the meaning? Does that change how those kids <br/>
feel or are treated?<br/>
<br/>
What used to be &quot;wild and distracted&quot; or &quot;hyperactive&quot; is now &quot;ADD&quot; <br/>
---how does that make the child feel? Better?<br/>
<br/>
What used to be &quot;difficult&quot; or &quot;strong-willed&quot; is now &quot;Oppositional <br/>
Defiant Disorder&quot; or &quot;ODD&quot;---how THAT for an acronym??<br/>
<br/>
When a child wasn&#39;t up to par with his classmates, he was considered <br/>
&quot;slow&quot;---does having &quot;Learning Differences&quot; make it all better? None of <br/>
us learn the *same*, but *HE* has &quot;learning differences.&quot;  They have <br/>
entire schools dedicated now to those with learning differences.<br/>
<br/>
I think the idea of failing in schools is an absolute AWFUL one.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad no one told me how I&#39;d failed when starting my garden. It&#39;s <br/>
taken years of trying and trying and having successes and failures to <br/>
figure out what works where or not at all. I could TELL that I&#39;d failed <br/>
having a plant *here* instead of *there*. I fixed it---or got a <br/>
different plant. So when I gave up and chose another plant---that <br/>
wasn&#39;t a &quot;deferred success&quot;---that was failure and I knew it wasn&#39;t the <br/>
plant for me. Time to find a more compatible plant for the garden. I <br/>
guess I *could* have kept trying to make that plant &quot;fit&quot; in direct sun <br/>
by watering it more and standing over it with an umbrella: I chose to <br/>
toss it out and find a better plant! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We have a billboard here in town with a photo of Edison and a <br/>
lightbulb---it says something like, &quot;On the 1,000,000th try, success!&quot; <br/>
But he assumed that he would succeed and that there would not be <br/>
failure, but deferred success. He wanted that light bulb to work!<br/>
<br/>
*I* think it&#39;s sometimes better to fail and be done with it. Those <br/>
school kids will *still* have to achieve success in order to not fail.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with Joyce: sounds like something Orwell could have written.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
&quot;Learning should be life-long and it should be something that everybody <br/>
knows<br/>
they can do and knows they can have a bash at.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We&#39;re not helping it. They are still talking pass and fail and it&#39;s a <br/>
very<br/>
depressing thing to deal with.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Mrs Beattie, who lives in Ipswich, continued: &quot;I&#39;d rather tell kids <br/>
that they<br/>
have done jolly well, they worked really well, they have achieved that <br/>
and<br/>
that&#39;s brilliant.&quot;<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think she&#39;s right here. I think learning IS life-long. I think you <br/>
should tell kids that they&#39;ve done jolly well. I think schools AREN&#39;T <br/>
helping and that they ARE depressing! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But in *real life* failure is a normal thing. It&#39;s like she&#39;s trying to <br/>
never have these kids think that failure is OK. It&#39;s just a step. A <br/>
learning-take.<br/>
<br/>
Failure is not always such a bad thing---not in the real world. Just in <br/>
schools.<br/>

<br/>
Kelly, I would disagree.  Maybe I&#39;ve lived with California psychobabble <br/>
too long, and have been warped, though. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think replacing one dead plant with another one that can thrive in <br/>
that spot is &quot;success&quot; or in that new phrase &quot;deferred success&quot;.  My <br/>
definition of (abject) failure would be planting one plant, having it <br/>
die, and concluding &quot;I can&#39;t grow anything here&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard that your first homeschooling conference was a raging <br/>
success.  But hypothetically, if the first one had been kind of a squib, <br/>
and then you had gone on to have bigger, fun-er conferences in future <br/>
years, that would be a fine example of &quot;deferred success&quot;.  I think I <br/>
just prefer to apply the word success or failure to the final state, not <br/>
the steps on the way.<br/>
<br/>
I flunked my driving test the first time and passed it a day later.  I <br/>
kind of wish that more classroom situation allowed multiple attempts at <br/>
tests.  (Just because a student failed once, doesn&#39;t mean he has failed <br/>
for all time.)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s helpful to consider phrases like &quot;short-term failure&quot; or <br/>
&quot;temporary setback&quot;.  I think institutional schooling implies to kids <br/>
that if they flunk one test about the Civil War they will be perpetually <br/>
stupid in that area and may never have the ability or opportunity to <br/>
learn about it. <br/>
<br/>
My two cents,<br/>

I am sorry I don�t reply much on this loop---very busy with 7 children<br/>
and day to day living.  Sandra I am writing you a bit out of desperation<br/>
again---but this time it is not with Mike----he is doing good for his<br/>
problems.  Let me bore you with a run down of this year----so you could<br/>
understand this problem.  In  October Rio ( 3rd girl ---15) ended up in<br/>
Pediatric ICU for a week she had severe asthma----she was attending 2<br/>
courses at UNLV----because she wanted to---I thought it was too early<br/>
but you know how Steve can be----so I allowed she took English and<br/>
Biology.  After the hospital I withdrew her from her classes because<br/>
there was no way for her to make up the work she missed 2 and half weeks<br/>
of college---and was to drugged up to even try to study on her own.<br/>
She went back in the spring only taking Biology in case something else<br/>
happened---which did ----she broke her right hand.  But she finished and<br/>
passed Biology all on her own.  I did go in an ask her if she prepared<br/>
for her test or anything---because this is what she chose to do.  Mike (<br/>
the oldest)  was discovered in December with a tumor in is sinuses.  <br/>
He chose not to go to college the spring semester---he had terrible<br/>
headaches and the steroid they put him on cause problems with anger and<br/>
the ability for him to focus ---he noticed this with his chess game<br/>
sliding a bit.  So he did nothing but take care of himself and deal with<br/>
this horrible disease----it is and allergic reaction to fungus---causing<br/>
a tumor in the sinus that moved both his nose and eye ---he became<br/>
slightly deformed as the tumor grew ---until they could get him into<br/>
surgery---had to have a 3 specialist there---two being neurologist and<br/>
one an ear nose throat surgeon----so it took 3 months to get this<br/>
surgery.  No brain compromise which was good.  But he still has drug<br/>
issues because this will be with him the rest of his life.  We are<br/>
dealing with insurance issues because he turns 18 in one month and he<br/>
can�t be uninsured---his drugs run over a 100 a month with<br/>
insurance----minor problem for me now---just money.  Kevin ( 2nd child<br/>
16) is doing good has a job---just as he wanted---likes working.  But my<br/>
problem now is Caty (4th child 14) She wants to go to public school.<br/>
She is a level 8 gymnast---but was pulled out of gym in January because<br/>
of all the hospital and drug expenses for Mike and Rio----we couldn�t<br/>
afford it.  She is angry with us---or upset.  I don�t know if I am being<br/>
to harsh.  But she now says she feels like we are locking her away from<br/>
friends and she has no social life anymore because we can�t afford to<br/>
send her to gym.  So she wants to go to school and to make friends.  Our<br/>
unschooling group does not have very many teens in it.  We haven�t found<br/>
very many unschool teenagers here.  The ones we know ---have to be part<br/>
of a class or structured event  to attend.  They are too busy to just<br/>
hang out and do what they want.  Understand my older 3 think Caty is<br/>
just throwing a tantrum because she isn�t the center of daddy�s world<br/>
being the best gymnast.  And to get dad�s attention she wants to go to<br/>
public school----she got dad�s attention---he wants her in all honors<br/>
classes.  Sandra----I unschool---she is not unlearned---she is a bright<br/>
child ---but she is not Mike or Rio either---she doesn�t pick up<br/>
Discover magazine and discuss the string theory and waves vs. particles,<br/>
nor does she follow Rio and devour every book she can.  She doesn�t even<br/>
do the math Rio and Mike will sit down and do just because they want to<br/>
know it.  Caty can read----she is meddling through the Leminy Snicket<br/>
series.  She is doing math right now because the older kids have taunted<br/>
her a bit. They are not pleased she wants to go to public school and<br/>
bring negative attention to us.  They don�t think she will like it.<br/>
Kevin says that Caty thinks public school is going to be like �That�s so<br/>
Raven�.  And they don�t want her going then dropping out in 4 wks.  I<br/>
told her if she didn�t like it she could quit before her first grades<br/>
came out;  but dad and the children said --- then don�t send her because<br/>
if she quits it will look bad for everyone in the family.  We are a bit<br/>
public because of the politics I have been involved in.  So I can<br/>
understand where the older 3 are coming from.  Kevin also doesn�t study<br/>
or read like Mike and Rio; and Kevin says that Caty won�t like the<br/>
work----since she doesn�t like to do now---she isn�t going to like any<br/>
more from school.  I have been making myself sick over this dilemma.  I<br/>
don�t want her to go to school.  But I wanted my children to be able to<br/>
choose a direction when they reach 14.  That is why I supported Rio in<br/>
college----it wasn�t a heavy load and she did it on her own.  I<br/>
supported Kevin when he wanted to wait to go to work----he had no<br/>
direction until then-----but he knew what he wanted---and he couldn�t<br/>
begin until he was 16.  So that was his choice.  So I feel like I am not<br/>
supporting Caty if I don�t let her go to school; and I supported all the<br/>
older 3 children�s decisions. <br/>
The sad part is I am being scrutinized by family and well meaning<br/>
friends.  They think it is great Caty wants to go to school<br/>
---especially some of the family and they specifically don�t think she<br/>
will succeed because they think what I am doing is wrong.  They say Caty<br/>
is too lazy----I argue she is not interested in Mike and Rio and there<br/>
are other things in life besides what is in books.  They say that Caty<br/>
going to school will prove that my unschooling is not working----- I<br/>
don�t unschool to prepare my children for school ---I am trying to<br/>
prepare them for life. I am so stressed and the older children hear this<br/>
and it makes them angry.  The older children don�t want Caty to be<br/>
allowed to go to school----they blame all the responses are negative and<br/>
are cause by Caty�s tantrum of wanting to go to school.  <br/>
Ask me some questions for clarification---but I am sending to the entire<br/>
group ---in case anyone has tried this and has some insight.  But I am<br/>
addressing you because you know me ---and watch our strange unschooling<br/>
practices and everything you suggested with Mike worked----go back to<br/>
what works.   <br/>
Your advice always has ----<br/>
Steve doesn�t want her in school either but feels pushed and thus<br/>
insists if she goes he will decide what she can and cant� do---including<br/>
honors courses. If she is compelled to go to school then she should<br/>
study something.  This is not a park day, and we will be watched. When<br/>
you open the doors people look in.   <br/>
Thanks for your time and patience again. <br/>
Kime<br/>

needs you to help her get ready -- skills, practice with writing,<br/>
math, talking about the rules, etc.  Do it out of a desire to help her<br/>
succeed with what she&#39;s chosen, not so she&#39;ll make you look good.<br/>
<br/>
If having to quit gymnastics was the trigger (and it sounds like it<br/>
was), find a way for her to return.  Working.  Bake sales.  A paper<br/>
route.  A loan for now.  If gymnastics is her passion, and you<br/>
unschool -- well, you can put it together from there.<br/>
<br/>
From your post, I don&#39;t know that school will make her happy -- it<br/>
just sounds like she&#39;s unhappy and she&#39;s trying one of the few options<br/>
she can think of in order to help herself be more happy.  I know you<br/>
have a lot going on, but maybe you can find a mentor or someone that<br/>
can help her reach her goals without school.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s at a tough age, she&#39;s being compared (at least in this post) to<br/>
her older siblings, and it sounds like nobody is happy with her.  Her<br/>
actions suddenly reflect on the whole family, when all she&#39;s trying to<br/>
do is find some happiness for herself.  She&#39;s being told she can&#39;t<br/>
even &quot;try and see&quot; this school option, when I&#39;m guessing she&#39;s always<br/>
been able to try and see before.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a fair situation.  Maybe you should see if you can make it<br/>
more fair and can give her some more empathy and understanding -- at<br/>
least from you, if not from the rest of the family.<br/>
<br/>

to.  Addressing the owners of the gym and asking if there is any way you or<br/>
Caty could barter with them will help them to realize just how serious she<br/>
is about it.  They can&#39;t help you if you don&#39;t make them aware of the<br/>

[Kime] agree---I think the older children and I are feeling<br/>
betrayed----Caty has every right to try school and if she doesn�t like<br/>
it she should have the choice not continue----if she likes it then we<br/>
will all miss her.   I guess we also fear she would like it too.  If we<br/>
get slack that she couldn�t handle it we will just have to deal with it.<br/>
This is what Caty wishes for herself.<br/>
<br/>
Can you maybe ask for the gym to give her a scholarship or loan or<br/>
something? <br/>
  Can she work cleaning there or something?<br/>
<br/>
Is there a high school/midschool with a gymnastics program?<br/>
[Kime] There is no gymnastics in public school it is all private---and<br/>
at her level it is too expensive to be funded.  We looked into other<br/>
ways to keep her in----I even took on a job myself.  The expenses kept<br/>
going up as she got better.  <br/>
There are other sports she is willing to try now----she would like to go<br/>
into cheerleading and diving at the public school.  She feels there she<br/>
has a chance to get as good as she can because it is free.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

[Kime] We did this----thanks----it ways more heavily because everyone<br/>

don�t want her to go then I should put my foot down.  My children have<br/>
no right to make decisions that I don�t like----this just doesn�t sit<br/>
right with me.  I think they need to start controlling some of their<br/>
future and decisions now-----<br/>
I need to trust that Caty knows what is best for Caty.  It�s just<br/>
hard----it was hard with Rio----but Rio did fine. <br/>

school----this wasn�t an issue before.  She was looked at for her<br/>

That&#39;s quite a bit of responsibility for a fourteen year old, to have even a <br/>
whiff of the idea that she would be betraying people.    Harsh thought and <br/>
concept, betrayal.<br/>

She could (and will) use other people&#39;s opinions as input and factors when <br/>

You said you waited until they were 14, though, to give them a choice.   <br/>

When I had to wait until I was 14 to wear makeup, by god I wore makeup at 14. <br/>
  I decided to let Holly wear all the makeup she wanted whenever she wanted <br/>
to, and when she was little she messed around with it quite a bit, and now at <br/>
13 she has gotten the whole urge out of her system.   She wears nail polish <br/>
sometimes.   That&#39;s it.<br/>
<br/>
I had to wait until I was 15 to go on dates, and I was &quot;only&quot; allowed to go <br/>
out three times a week:   until 11:00 (later midnight) on Friday and Saturday, <br/>
and until 10:30 on Wednesday.   Guess what?   I went.   I arranged to go.   I <br/>
was out those three times (sometimes alone in a car with a boy, but not <br/>
always) because I had waited for it, I had &quot;paid my dues,&quot; it was a limited offer, <br/>
it was &quot;use it or lose it&quot;--no banking up of days or hours, and so I went out.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe by making children wait fourteen years for a decision, they will only <br/>
feel powerful and &quot;decisive&quot; if they make decisions you don&#39;t like so that it <br/>
really shows.   If they just do what will make the mom feel happy (and not feel <br/>
&quot;betrayed&quot;) it won&#39;t seem like a decision.<br/>
<br/>
I think you have many more rules and timings and requirements and such than <br/>
we do at our house.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Maybe---the negativity was only spawned from her wanting to go to<br/>
school----this wasn’t an issue before.  She was looked at for her<br/>
accomplishments---=-<br/>
<br/>
What if she hadn&#39;t had &quot;accomplishments&quot;?<br/>
&quot;Spawn&quot; is a negative word too.   Why can&#39;t her decision be something that <br/>
doesn&#39;t cause ANYTHING to &quot;spawn&quot; (nor any negativity)?<br/>
<br/>
-=-And she is choosing a new direction because we can’t<br/>
afford the one she was in.-=- <br/>
<br/>
So?<br/>
Does she have a choice or not?<br/>
<br/>
I still think you should borrow money to keep her in gymnastics.    <br/>

<br/>
I missed the first part of this discussion but as a former karate student <br/>
and teacher and the current mom of a gymnast, this is a very common <br/>
situation.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve known people to barter secretarial work, law expertise, janitorial <br/>
work, cooking, babysitting, etc. so their kids could take classes.  My <br/>
daughter was able to work a deal where she helped with the tiny tot classes <br/>
and she was only 12.  Give it a shot.  It can&#39;t hurt.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; If having to quit gymnastics was the trigger (and it sounds like it<br/>
&gt; was), find a way for her to return.  Working.  Bake sales.  A paper<br/>
&gt; route.  A loan for now.  If gymnastics is her passion, and you<br/>
&gt; unschool -- well, you can put it together from there.<br/>
<br/>
Making people aware of your dreams allows them to help you if they choose<br/>
to.  Addressing the owners of the gym and asking if there is any way you or<br/>
Caty could barter with them will help them to realize just how serious she<br/>
is about it.  They can&#39;t help you if you don&#39;t make them aware of the<br/>
situation.  I vote to try to find a way to get her back at the gym as often<br/>
as possible.  Must be something you could try that you haven&#39;t thought of.<br/>

If this many members of my family were trying to act like they were my parents and steer my course through life, I think I&#39;d be cranky and rebellious and generally pissed off about it.  I think being parented by committee is irksome.  (I&#39;m the oldest in my family, so I haven&#39;t had to live with it myself.)<br/>

Steve doesn’t want her in school either but feels pushed and thus<br/>
insists if she goes he will decide what she can and cant’ do---including<br/>
honors courses. **<br/>
<br/>
She seems to me to be too old to be treated like a puppet!  Your husband and older kids seem to only believe in empowering unschooled children when it suits them, but are quick to throw the principles overboard when it gets challenging.  I understand that so far it is just unsupportive words (not many unsupportive actions) and it&#39;s good that everyone can be honest, but the weight of all these negative opinions is building up to be pretty crushing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1193757003">I am still reading---nothing is in stone----I never<br/>
thought about the waiting issue----that age was picked because you can<br/>
not get a work permit in NV until you are 14.  Until then we just<br/>
enjoyed what we could and a couple of children chose some strong<br/>
directions.  Mike did become a Master at chess----Caty did become an<br/>
optional gymnast.  But Mike�s sport got cheaper as he go better and<br/>
Caty�s go more expensive.  We had to pull 3 of the other children out of<br/>
their activities also---they haven�t had the chance to get that good.<br/>
We do not qualify for any credit----we are basically extended because of<br/>
our medical bills right now.   I can�t fix our finances----I told the<br/>
children that we have to live within our financial means.  And this<br/>
changes constantly.   We had been flush for about 3 yrs. and the<br/>
children had more choices----(not jobs of course----but activities)<br/>
Now, we can�t afford these things and we had to leave all our<br/>
activities----Caty paid the highest price, Mike wasn�t as affected<br/>
because his sport earned him money and scholarships.  <br/>
I still believe you may be correct on the fact that she is going because<br/>
she now has a choice and did not have this choice before----but it never<br/>
even occurred to us that one of the children would want to go to school.<br/>
But I don�t want to deny her other opportunities that she thinks the<br/>
schools will provide her.   <br/>
I am still sick over it---and your correct in some respects she no<br/>
longer has certain choices anymore.   She can choose to get a volunteer<br/>
job now----but she doesn�t want to do that.   Her choices are limited to<br/>
what we can afford.  This yr.  Mike has decide to go to college�he has a<br/>
scholarship, and Kevin is working, and Rio is staying home---taking some<br/>
online college courses with her small earnings----babysitting.  Caty<br/>
wants to be at school.  <br/>
 I feel the negativity because I feel like I failed her or made home so<br/>
miserable that she would prefer to be away 6 hrs a day at gym----or now<br/>
at a school.   The older children feel like she is going to change our<br/>
way of life with school-----but it is changing constantly now with the<br/>
older children setting out on their own.  <br/>
We probably do have more  many more rules and timings here----part of it<br/>
is due to the children out numbering us  and myself becoming to<br/>
exhausted trying to keep up with 7 children.  My timings are due to what<br/>
is legal and acceptable to both Steve and I -----they can�t stay home<br/>
alone till 11----they can�t baby sit till 13,  they can�t stay up all<br/>
night till 13----the older children set this one----due to the fact they<br/>
don�t want to assist or be responsible for their younger brothers and<br/>
sisters----and because they get so cranky.   So yes we do have timings<br/>
here----age passages.  My house never sleeps----it is awake 24/7 with<br/>
the 4 older on their own schedules---and the kitchen never closes.  <br/>
Thanks for your input and questions it gave us something to think about<br/>
and clarify.  <br/>
I don�t know if I am doing a good job here though.  Our feeling are<br/>
running high here in the family, I do apologize for letting them out<br/>
here----I am not as upset as Sunday----but then we have all come to<br/>
accept the decisions being made by everyone here.   <br/>

Unfortunately, I think Sandra&#39;s point was made before she even gave her <br/>
answer:<br/>
<br/>
Here are older children who wanted to make a rule for the younger ones <br/>
so that the older ones didn&#39;t have to assist or be responsible for <br/>
them. It&#39;s too bad the older ones didn&#39;t want to assist. It&#39;s too bad <br/>
that they felt responsible. Too bad the younger ones were cranky. Too <br/>
bad their relationships were damaged before they could even get off the <br/>
ground.<br/>
<br/>
These arbitrary rules have already led away from good relationships and <br/>
choices.<br/>

I&#39;ve heard that your first homeschooling conference was a raging<br/>
success.  But hypothetically, if the first one had been kind of a <br/>
squib,<br/>
and then you had gone on to have bigger, fun-er conferences in future<br/>
years, that would be a fine example of &quot;deferred success&quot;.  I think I<br/>
just prefer to apply the word success or failure to the final state, <br/>
not<br/>
the steps on the way.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Raging success.  &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
LOL<br/>
<br/>
Right.<br/>
<br/>
My keynote speaker fell and spent the rest of the conference (plus <br/>
another couple of days [daze]) in the hospital on morphine. Three <br/>
funshoppers just didn&#39;t show up. And I lost just over a grand <br/>
personally.<br/>
<br/>
The second year had some mishaps too. I guess they&#39;re unavoidable. But <br/>
at least I didn&#39;t lose my shirt!<br/>
<br/>
So----just don&#39;t believe everything you hear! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>

Maybe it&#39;s helpful to consider phrases like &quot;short-term failure&quot; or<br/>
&quot;temporary setback&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=--=<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like either of those terms. &quot;Learning-takes&quot; is better---for me <br/>
anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I figure I&#39;m learning all the time. I try NOT to look at things as <br/>
failures or as deferred successes: I just haven&#39;t figured it out...yet! <br/>

I think institutional schooling implies to kids<br/>

If learning is the goal...<br/>
<br/>
Well but there might be something like learning to knit.   If you want to <br/>
learn to knit you might have deferred success, I guess.   Or just a slow start if <br/>
you don&#39;t pick it up easily.<br/>
<br/>
Marty kinda started learning banjo.   He hasn&#39;t failed to learn banjo, he <br/>
just hasn&#39;t finished yet.<br/>
Kirby, lately, guitar--just kinda a little.   Same thing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1526722835">** Raging success.  &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
LOL<br/>
<br/>
Right.<br/>
<br/>
My keynote speaker fell and spent the rest of the conference (plus<br/>
another couple of days [daze]) in the hospital on morphine. Three<br/>
funshoppers just didn&#39;t show up. And I lost just over a grand<br/>
personally.**<br/>
<br/>
But it went down in the history books &lt;g&gt; as a success as people just <br/>
couldn&#39;t stop burbling about it afterwards.  And the subsequent <br/>
conferences overwrite people&#39;s memories of the first, right?  (Your <br/>
reality is just sharper and bites harder than everyone else&#39;s reality -- <br/>
excepting of course the pain in Sandra&#39;s ankle.)<br/>
<br/>
** So----just don&#39;t believe everything you hear! &lt;G&gt;**<br/>
<br/>
Unless a teacher or textbook says so???  &lt;eg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
** I don&#39;t like either of those terms. &quot;Learning-takes&quot; is better---for me<br/>
anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I figure I&#39;m learning all the time. I try NOT to look at things as<br/>
failures or as deferred successes: I just haven&#39;t figured it out...yet!<br/>
&lt;g&gt;**<br/>
<br/>
I love the coinage of the term &quot;funshop&quot;, because &quot;work-shop&quot; is only <br/>
maybe two notches better than &quot;sweatshop&quot;.  (Ick!)   I&#39;ll try to adopt <br/>
&quot;learning-takes&quot; or coin my own positive word.  (Ventures?  As in <br/>
&quot;Nothing ventured nothing gained.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Pam has stated &quot;learning is pleasurable&quot;, which is a topic I&#39;d like to <br/>
play with a bit more.  When Edison persistently tested all those light <br/>
bulb filaments, was he feeling pleasure?  Clearly something was learned <br/>
from each outcome.  (I know he had a positive way of looking at each <br/>
negative test result, but was it actually pleasurable?)<br/>
<br/>
I think bopping ideas around on these email lists is a pleasure, <br/>
especially when that light bulb goes on in my head!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think replacing one dead plant with another one that can thrive in<br/>
that spot is &quot;success&quot; or in that new phrase &quot;deferred success&quot;.  My<br/>
definition of (abject) failure would be planting one plant, having it<br/>
die, and concluding &quot;I can&#39;t grow anything here&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So it depends on the stated goal.   <br/>
I want to grow moonflowers.   I have vines taller than I am but no flowers.   <br/>
It&#39;s not that I want to grow something in that spot, I want to grow <br/>
MOONFLOWERS (that bloom). <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If school changes the name of &quot;fail&quot; to &quot;deffered success,&quot; it will only be a <br/>
week before kids refer to slower kids as &quot;deferred kids.&quot;      When our <br/>
school went from &quot;retarded&quot; to &quot;special ed&quot; it didn&#39;t even take as much as a week <br/>
for the new insult to be &quot;you special-ed,&quot; or &quot;Why don&#39;t you go to special ed?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
YES, when money is involved, a below average kid can eventually &quot;out-succeed&quot; <br/>
his schoolmates.<br/>
When grade levels and age divisions and evaluations are involved, the kids <br/>
wll not care if you call it strawberry ice cream heaven, behind is behind and <br/>
they know it.<br/>

Don&#39;t water them so much.  If you&#39;ve fertilized,  stop.  Profuse vines with <br/>
no blooms usually means the conditions are &quot;too  good&quot;.  <br/>

<br/>
I saw that on a couple of landscaping trucks the other day of all things.<br/>
<br/>
It works for Unschoolers, too, because we aren&#39;t testing, we aren&#39;t<br/>
comparing, we aren&#39;t holding ourselves to other people&#39;s standards.<br/>
<br/>
I doubt people who look at themselves and their children as failures<br/>
stick around the unschooling boards very long. <br/>
