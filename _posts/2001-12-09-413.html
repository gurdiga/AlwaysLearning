<div id="ygrps-yiv-454826899">Hi, Everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to let you know that I have checked my mail about every hour since five this morning and have really been boosted by the thoughtful, heartfelt, concrete, philosophical, gentle reminders you have shared with me and each other. I tried out more than a few suggestions today and find myself with more energy and optimism than I have had in a while! So many of you really gave me food for thought and helped me to just get my act together. Thanks especially to Mary (and the others of you who responded on unschooling.dotcom so soon after I lost my dad when I was floundering terribly) for the sympathy. My dad was supposed to be a huge part of our unschooling journey with his wide-ranging knowledge, his infectious love of discovery, and his willingness to be the biggest kid around...*I* wanted to learn with him again...Ah, well, at least I have a clearer view ahead of me now with my immediate concerns about the bad vibes to/from my really great children. Thanks!<br/>
Jennifer<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That is so sweet. You may find that he is still a big part of your journey. <br/>
His energy, his spirit, his memory will be infused into so many things you <br/>
do. Although he won&#39;t be there physically, he will be that sweet feeling you <br/>
get when *you* now get to be the biggest kid around.<br/>
