because she expects people to treat her with respect while the group expects<br/>
only adults to be treated with respect.<br/>

Sorscha has always been the teachers pet in classes or I get the talking too<br/>
from the teacher about her behavior. Total opposites!!  Typically it is not<br/>
a problem with the kidlets, but with the instructor. When she was younger<br/>
(yup, she&#39;s still young...8...but when she was younger) I could not figure<br/>
it out.  Only in the past year have I gotten it.<br/>
<br/>
It is also the respect thing.  If the instructor is the authoritarian type<br/>
and shows zero respect for her, then she shows zero respect for them, and I<br/>
get that talking to.<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I have found it quite funny.  Upon picking her up we will<br/>
either get,<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Your daughter led the group.  She&#39;s great&quot;<br/>
<br/>
or<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Your daughter disrupted the class.  She&#39;s a pest&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I &#39;m exaggerating, but it is funny how opposite it is.  Anyhow,<br/>
anything she wants to sign up for, she knows that she can decide to quit<br/>
when she wants to.  Fortunately, because her dad and I got it, we did not<br/>
turn these classes, camps, etc. into a negative thing.<br/>
