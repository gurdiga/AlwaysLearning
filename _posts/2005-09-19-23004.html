 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m getting Life Learning Magazine and Live Free Learn Free magazine.  There is always something great and helpful in every issue.  A lot of it is stuff you can get on lists or boards, but the magazine format is easy to carry around and share with others.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1984804492">One disadvantage to magazines is that they don&#39;t have the conversation aspect that email forums and lists have.  On a list or forum you can ask and answer questions to further clarify or explain things.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-14469859">I know nothing about Growler tapes, but I think Danielle Conger&#39;s on this <br/>
list, and I think Life Learning Magazine is good.   <br/>

I think Danielle&#39;s site, Joyce Fetteroll&#39;s and mine probably have enough <br/>
information and links to other information to keep anyone reading for a year or <br/>
so, though. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
