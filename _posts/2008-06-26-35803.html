<div id="ygrps-yiv-459919527">I don&#39;t think anyone teaches a child to read until that child is ready.<br/>
<br/>
My ds taught himself to read before age 4, and my dd is still learning.  <br/>
Both kids practically begged me to teach them to read when they were 2.  <br/>
With ds, I thought he was kidding- you learn to read when you go to <br/>
school, lol.  With dd, I had already had the benefit of seeing ds teach <br/>
himself- so I told her she will get it when she is ready.<br/>
<br/>
If she asked now, I would ask, &#39;What would you like me to do to help?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
One thing we do sometimes, that both my children have *loved* is <br/>
treasure hunts.  They start with a picture, and then another picture, <br/>
etc...then move to &quot;Look in the...&quot;.  If I do one for ds9 now, it is <br/>
more along the line of a code, or scrambled words, etc.  For my dd <br/>
(nearly 6) I try to make the words phonetic, since that is how she <br/>
reads- she knows very few words on sight.<br/>
<br/>
The other one we do is scavenger hunts...my dd loves to check things off <br/>
:0)  I will write things like &quot;something red&quot;, &quot;something round&quot;, <br/>
&quot;something funny&quot;.  Once I even added &quot;Please pick up the Lego&quot;, <br/>
lol...and she did, then ticked it off and bought the paper back to me.<br/>
<br/>
My dd is not at all confident with reading, and so generally I don&#39;t ask <br/>
her to.  dh and I don&#39;t agree on that one.  I really feel that in asking <br/>
her to read (I mean a single word here and there), she has got it on her <br/>
head that she *can&#39;t* do it.  Leaving her alone, and having the odd fun <br/>
reading-type thing (completely initiated by her) is what we are doing <br/>
now, and I think it is a kind and respectful way to honour her.<br/>

<br/>
If unschooling works well for you, you&#39;ll never teach a child to read.<br/>
And it&#39;s likely that teachers at school have  never taught a child to  <br/>
read.<br/>
<br/>
But whether the teacher teaches... if distributing, retrieving,  <br/>
scoring, recording and returning worksheets is teaching, then they  <br/>
do!   At any one moment, some of the kids are going to be on the edge  <br/>
of figuring out reading.  Maybe something they&#39;ve heard will help.   <br/>
Maybe it will baffle them.  Maybe some of them are afraid and feel  <br/>
like reading is beyond them and will be scarred for years.<br/>
<br/>
If a child learns to read while a teacher is trying to teach him to  <br/>
read, that does NOT mean the teacher did it, caused it, or even helped.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I think it will help you move further faster if you revise this  <br/>
thought to &quot;I had already seen him learn to read.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He didn&#39;t need a teacher, not even himself.<br/>

<br/>
Reading to her would be better than either of the extremes you&#39;re  <br/>
considering, I think.  You could sing to her from a song book open in  <br/>
your lap.  Read stories.  Read menus, movie schedules--don&#39;t run your  <br/>
finger along, just help her be fully familiar with what reading&#39;s  <br/>
good for and what you&#39;re getting from it and that it&#39;s not all in  <br/>
&quot;readers&quot; or books for kids--it&#39;s on the fruit stickers at the store,  <br/>
and on tires to show how much air they should have and what size they  <br/>
are, and on the backs of clocks.<br/>

<br/>
I was just thinking about this today because on Monday someone complimented<br/>
Marti&#39;s reading skills. She is 8 (or will be in about 3 weeks) and I believe<br/>
she reads at or above her level (whatever that means), but really don&#39;t know<br/>
in honesty. I think the reason that I get this comment (Wow! She reads<br/>
really well for her age) is because she looks younger than she is (many<br/>
people think she is 6).<br/>
<br/>
But the situation left me wondering what to say to someone that tells me<br/>
that she reads well. I know that &quot;She taught herself&quot; isn&#39;t &quot;appropriate&quot; if<br/>
you ask Sandra (lol), but with others outside the unschooling world, it<br/>
seems like the best answer I can come up with. A couple times it has sparked<br/>
a conversation and sometimes I hope the little things (like that or like<br/>
seeing the girls out and about with us during school hours or seeing that we<br/>
treat our girls like we love them instead of like they are burdens (which<br/>
happens a lot when you ride the city bus around here)) will enlighten<br/>
people. I don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I my point was that I was just exploring this theme today. Crazy how<br/>
that works, huh?<br/>

What about &quot;She learned it gradually on her own, with just a little  <br/>

I bet it will, but maybe not the same day or the same week.   Maybe  <br/>
some of them will carry on as they are for ten years, and then  <br/>
something else will remind them of what you said, or what they saw  <br/>

I don&#39;t usually mind when something I&#39;ve said lies dormant in someone  <br/>
else until they discover a use for it, but with unschooling, when  <br/>

Yeah, I know.  I&#39;m kind of a bully about clarity.  Instead of &quot;sit  <br/>

working on a website dedicated to mindful parenting.  I have described<br/>
unschooling philosophy to them (I MUST translate the screw up page as<br/>
soon as possible) and it is so frustrating.   THere are all these<br/>
families putting their little ones into nursery school (2 years, 3y)<br/>
and lamenting the fact that the schools are pushing against an slow<br/>
attachment orientd insertion ...most say they dont *have* to work but<br/>
that they must &quot; grow up sometime&quot; (a particular quote from one<br/>
recently)...<br/>
<br/>
I feel so much pain for this time pressure thing...how can one get it<br/>
across effectively that children are children for such a small amount<br/>
of time?  Not every one has 7 kids...one child is small for such a<br/>
short time.  what are 10 15 years in the whole scheme of things?...A<br/>
whole life for a child, but for me, Im forty five this year and it<br/>
doesnt even seem like enough time yet (luckily ive got more littlies,<br/>
lol)...<br/>

One day when I was a young adult and my mom was living with us (me,  <br/>
my first husband, his young brother and sister and my half brother) I  <br/>
asked her to help me do something.  It wasn&#39;t big or awful--some  <br/>

<br/>
I was already to the point that I kinda wished she was dead, before  <br/>
she could do any more damage to my little brother.<br/>
<br/>
Possibly she was brain damaged.  Certainly she was traumatized and  <br/>
malnourished as a kid.  I could either let her early trauma and  <br/>
alcoholism take me down, and my kids too, or I could step away from  <br/>
her and raise my kids with very little of her presence, which is what  <br/>
I did.<br/>

She was relieved, overall.  My kids &quot;made her nervous.&quot;  There were  <br/>
some spans of time when she wasn&#39;t drinking and I kinda tried to make  <br/>
up for lost time with her, but when she was drinking it was easy for  <br/>
me to distance quickly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t always easy, but Al-Anon had/has an Adult Children of  <br/>
Alcoholics program and I was going weekly for about four years.  It  <br/>
made a big difference in my life, and along with La Leche League, I  <br/>
think that&#39;s why my kids&#39; baby years were so peaceful.  I made their  <br/>
peace and comfort a priority, and it led to all this other business:   <br/>
Kirby&#39;s up for a promotion (at a real job, at 21), Marty is buying a  <br/>
Jeep, and Holly spent the afternoon with her boyfriend&#39;s mom (and the  <br/>
boyfriend was there, but I understand that much of the interaction  <br/>
was between Holly and the mom).<br/>
<br/>
My kids are strong and centered and good and unaccustomed to the  <br/>
sorts of dysfunctional nonsense I and a badillion others accepted as  <br/>
inevitable or normal (or worse; as our fault).<br/>

There are pockets of loyalty in many people&#39;s lives devoted to the shrine of<br/>
their parents, to the exclusion of their own family.<br/>

I think it&#39;s based on false ideas of scarcity: that love, loyalty, and so<br/>

That&#39;s  the time during which I decided (and have written a couple of <br/>
times) that  I was going to be my children&#39;s mother, and not my <br/>
mother&#39;s  daughter.<br/>
<br/>
Dysfunctional families keep adults in child-roles in  emotionally <br/>
crippling ways. Childless adults can afford to be cripples  more than <br/>
parents can. The behaviors of alcoholics, and the results of  <br/>
alcoholism can go to the third generation even if the parents didn&#39;t  <br/>
drink. There are crazy ideas that people live with and pass  on.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Strange how &quot;natural parenting&quot; can seem so unnatural when you&#39;ve grown up  <br/>
without it. It often feels lame or contrived when I take a different tac <br/>
(tack?)  with my kids than was taken by my parents with me. I was shamed and mocked <br/>
for  crying out loud, so it seems odd and unnatural for me to reach my arms <br/>
out in  comfort to my older child when he is crying. Although, the more I do it, <br/>
the  less &quot;odd&quot; it feels. Hopefully, it doesn&#39;t feel forced to *him*. Most of <br/>
how I  relate to my kids (in a respectful way when Dave and I came to it) <br/>
began  with an obvious pause before I reacted or said something-*very*  <br/>
unnatural-feeling! Slowly, incrementally, almost unnoticeably, that pause gets  <br/>
shorter. Occasionally, I&#39;ll react without thinking first! It is a cause for  <br/>
celebration within myself when I realize it later on.<br/>
 <br/>
I didn&#39;t realize how &quot;tiny&quot; my steps would be when I started down this  <br/>
gentle, respectful parenting path. I wanted to &quot;get it&quot; so quickly... I was  <br/>
wanting to take huge leaps, looking for big, neon road signs.... It isn&#39;t until  <br/>
I&#39;ve slightly veered off the main path and traveled a ways that I turn in  <br/>
frustration to look back and am surprised how the slight angle and tiny steps  away <br/>
from that main path have brought me so far! I&#39;m not quite sure when I ended  <br/>
up in this part of the world, since the change of scenery has been so gradual,  <br/>
but it is wonderful to be here.<br/>

against the wind when you are sailing.  I think its a good word.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All of those decision, or paths, could be a changing of direction or<br/>
&quot;tacking&quot;.  Going against the wind, or mainstream parenting, or our<br/>
learned behavior, its more difficult at first and presents challenges. <br/>
Tacking is fun though, once you get the hang of it.  It involves a back<br/>
and forth movement, like for instance in a river you&#39;d go from bank to<br/>
bank almost, all while going in a direction against the wind.  So really<br/>
you get to explore a lot more water and scenery.  It makes the smooth<br/>
sailing with the wind even more rewarding and pleasurable.<br/>
<br/>
I liked the analogy that you put into my head without even realizing it!</div>

1. the part of a rope between the ends.<br/>

confuse that with &quot;bite&quot;, I guess thinking it may have been named <br/>
that because one could imagine a huge bite taken out of that coast by <br/>
a gigantic sea-monster. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I knew a woman whose brand new MIL went on their honeymoon and insisted on being treated as the guest of honor.  On the HONEYMOON!  She seemed to be there to ensure that she got the biggest share of love and loyalty from her son.  Scary stuff!  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a pretty dramatic story, but I think this dynamic plays out on a smaller scale in a lot of families.  I think that unschooling offers the best possibility I&#39;ve seen so far to create harmonious relationships based on things like enjoyment, respect and thoughfulness instead of scarcity, guilt and obligation.<br/>
