<div id="ygrps-yiv-2101998630">-=-She then says to me  &quot;see, that doesn&#39;t make any sense to me...why does wuh,,,.water  start with duh...double-u.    &#39;wuh&#39; doesn&#39;t sound like &#39;duh’.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
It’s a name for a symbol.<br/>
Double u (or double v, in some language) is old, and is about what it looks like (two of another letter stuck together).  <br/>
<br/>
Some people don’t teach “the alphabet” by  names, but by sounds.  That’s not a perfect way either, as letters have more than one sound.<br/>
<br/>
If someone tried to teach a child to sound out, that can cause more confusion than help.  It’s good to let kids figure it out in their own ways, answering their questions along the way.<br/>
<br/>
-=-And it gives me more insight into why she isn&#39;t interested in reading yet...it doesn&#39;t make sense to her, yet.-=-<br/>
<br/>
When it makes sense to her, she won’t be “interested in reading”; she will BE reading, when it makes sense to her.<br/>
<br/>
It’s not interest or desire that cause reading to kick in.  It’s many small maturities and clues that can only be gathered and accomplished within that individual.  Outside pressure can keep it from happening, but it cannot cause reading to happen.<br/>
