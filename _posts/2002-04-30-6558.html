&quot;I was wondering where everyone is located? Do any of you ever get <br/>
together? We are in Jacksonville. We haven&#39;t been able to find a <br/>
group to get together with that share my interest in Unschooling. So <br/>
far the reactions I have gotten have been less than encouraging. <br/>
(Except for here... thank you, thank you, thank you) &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well here ya go Rebecca. This is an e-mail list for FL unschoolers. <br/>
Apparently there are a lot of us!! Only three families here in P&#39;cola so far, <br/>
but one is moving to NC soon.<br/>
