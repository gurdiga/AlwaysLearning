<div id="ygrps-yiv-1691663214">This issues is a bit different if your child has<br/>
special needs.  My older son, Thomas, is extremely<br/>
sensative and lacks a lot of filtering ability that<br/>
most people have.  He is definately what would be<br/>
described as a &quot;special needs&quot; kid and takes special<br/>
consideration.  More and more kids now are being born<br/>
with &quot;special needs&quot; similar to our son.  Why is that?<br/>
 Chemicals in our food and environment?  Other<br/>
environmental changes?  Some sort of evolutionary<br/>
spin?  All of those?  Who knows..the point is that<br/>
when some families say that they &quot;HAD&quot; to cut out tv<br/>
or certain programming, you can&#39;t judge them all by<br/>
the same standard.  Not all kids are the same.  This<br/>
is what happened with Thomas.  <br/>
<br/>
When he was younger (3-4-5) we had to &quot;ban&quot; certain<br/>
movies/shows at home, not by choice, but out of<br/>
necessity.  It was a mutual ban, where we talked with<br/>
him about how his behavior was being affected and how<br/>
maybe he should wait a while before trying those<br/>
programs again and he agreed.  We could afford cable<br/>
at that time and tv watching was really profoundly<br/>
affecting all our lives in a negative way.  We didn&#39;t<br/>
limit their choices at all, and the results for us<br/>
were scary.  Our younger child has always been of a<br/>
patient and gentle disposition and doesn&#39;t have the<br/>
special needs of his brother, so filtering and<br/>
behaviors never became an issue for him personally. <br/>
His brother&#39;s behavior affected all of us, however,<br/>
him most of all.<br/>
<br/>
What shows?  Well Disney&#39;s 101 Dalmations was one of<br/>
them.  The most colorful and impressive character on<br/>
that show is of course Cruella.  Our son was emulating<br/>
her behavior, slapping his little brother full across<br/>
the face, calling him or us &quot;You Idiot!&quot; and<br/>
&quot;Imbiciles!&quot; and emulating other of her behaviors. <br/>
There were also shows which gave him horrible<br/>
nightmares, which he is prone to, and were causing<br/>
sleepless nights and a lot of stress for all of us. <br/>
There were other shows in which the main problems were<br/>
violent or uncontrolled behaviors emulated.  These<br/>
were not one time &quot;experimentation&quot; things.  We tried<br/>
talking with him about the behaviors.  Without fail,<br/>
each time he viewed the shows, there would come the<br/>
behaviors afterwards.  <br/>
<br/>
He still does this today, emulating what he sees in<br/>
games, in videos, or hears in stories, running to<br/>
invent a game based on things he&#39;s just been exposed<br/>
to.  I know that&#39;s normal for kids, and now he does it<br/>
in a more normally selective way and is better able to<br/>
understand what is socially acceptable behavior and<br/>
what is &quot;bad guy&quot; stuff, although we still sometimes<br/>
have to talk to him about that.  <br/>
<br/>
Current examples of ongoing problems from tv:  It&#39;s<br/>
NOT ok to spit on people when you are really angry<br/>
with them, even if the hero does it to the bad guy in<br/>
a movie (particularly when you are talking about<br/>
someone with an explosive temperment who is mad a<br/>
lot)... It&#39;s NOT ok to punch/kick/bite/head butt/etc.<br/>
others because they are saying something you don&#39;t<br/>
like, which is not just about teasing but also when he<br/>
doesn&#39;t get his way or we&#39;re not doing what he<br/>
wants....Dropping your pants in public, or in other<br/>
ways exposing yourself at home, is not funny, even if<br/>
it seems really funny in a movie (this is from a<br/>
somewhat nudist family where we believe skin is<br/>
healthy, and the boys still bathe together, and we<br/>
don&#39;t hide in shame when we&#39;re dressing and we let<br/>
them run around naked in our private forested home in<br/>
the summertime or swim in their little pool naked -<br/>
but I&#39;m talking about imappropriately being nasty - so<br/>
much so that he is currently not allowed to go without<br/>
pants at home because when the pants go, his humanity<br/>
seems to go also....Cussing people out and calling<br/>
names (he&#39;s picked up some doozies from tv) is not<br/>
cool, funny, or acceptable at home or elsewhere - this<br/>
from a family that doesn&#39;t believe in &quot;bad words&quot; and<br/>
has no problem with the kids cussing at home and<br/>
playing with words, but I am talking about being<br/>
hateful and hurtful to people, like when you tell your<br/>
kid there is no more ice cream and he screams that you<br/>
are a stupid fucking pig bitch, well, that&#39;s a<br/>
problem....<br/>
<br/>
These days he will ask us for help in making decisions<br/>
about movies to watch.  He will ask us &quot;Is this too<br/>
scary for me?&quot;  or  &quot;IS this ok for kids?&quot;  Which is<br/>
his way of asking if it&#39;s ok for HIM in particular. <br/>
Lot&#39;s of gore (ie: Gladiator, Braveheart, etc) or lots<br/>
of terror/tragedy he cannot handle.  The oddest things<br/>
give him horrible nightmares (like the Wizard of Oz,<br/>
or Sleeping Beauty, which he still will not watch) and<br/>
then incongruous things never seem to bother him at<br/>
all or cause any behavior problems (like Conan, The<br/>
Mummy, Air Force One.)  He will stop us partway into a<br/>
movie he has not seen before and say &quot;I don&#39;t like<br/>
this&quot; or &quot;It&#39;s scaring me&quot; and turn it off.  He will<br/>
sometimes stop us partway through movies he HAS seen<br/>
before and say the same things, as though he is at a<br/>
developmental stage where it bothers him now, where<br/>
before it didn&#39;t.  He may watch a movie all the way<br/>
through and then not ask for it again for years, which<br/>
is another indication that he was not ready for it.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway my point is that not all kids are exactly<br/>
alike.  Some are more impressionable, or less able to<br/>
decipher the complex social clues in movies to<br/>
understand what is satire or what is not ok in real<br/>
life.  Some adults are like that too, for that matter.<br/>
 It&#39;s not a matter of intelligence levels, but of<br/>
intelligence types and different ways of absorbing<br/>
information.  It&#39;s especially important for people<br/>
like that to have early practice deciphering those<br/>
clues and understanding socially acceptable behaviors<br/>
because it&#39;s not as natural for them to understand and<br/>
they NEED more practice.  But it&#39;s also important not<br/>
to drown them with stimuli (which is not hard to do<br/>
when they lack filtering tools and self control) while<br/>
they are trying to learn these things.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s a *good* thing to help kids recognize what effect the world has on them<br/>
and gain power over something that&#39;s affecting them.<br/>
<br/>
Banning something, eg, taking control away from the child for the child&#39;s<br/>
own good, does the opposite. It tells the child he isn&#39;t as powerful as the<br/>
thing so someone must keep it away from him to protect him.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I can see your point about the specific definition of the word ban, <br/>
and perhaps in our case boycott or abstaining would be a better <br/>
choice.  However I think the original question was about unschoolers <br/>
living without tv, not about parents choosing to ban their children <br/>
from tv specifically.  So we are unschoolers living without <br/>
broadcast tv, just our movie collection, and I was more speaking in <br/>
terms of how and why that decision was made and how it affects our <br/>
lives and all that.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Probably the most empowering way of phrasing it is &quot;choosing not to watch&quot;<br/>
something. It gives power to the person rather than the thing.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, you&#39;re right about the original question being whether any unschoolers<br/>
live without TV.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to ramble on not to reprimand you but because I&#39;m fascinated by<br/>
communication: the idea of transfering ideas from one person&#39;s head to<br/>
another person&#39;s head.<br/>
<br/>
Word choice is important when we&#39;re trying to get ideas across to each<br/>
other. If one person is using ban to mean an authority figure is preventing<br/>
someone from seeing something and another person is using ban to mean<br/>
someone choosing not to watch something, it&#39;s very difficult to discuss<br/>
whether banning is good or not when neither realizes they aren&#39;t meaning the<br/>
same thing when they say &quot;ban&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
There was an infamous heated discussion on the Unschooling.com message<br/>
baords that went on for a couple of days where one word was unknowingly<br/>
being used with 3 different meanings. Person A would read the arguments<br/>
assuming the word was being used as person A meant it and be flabbergasted<br/>
that others could believe such things and then Person A would counter argue.<br/>
Person B wouldn&#39;t realize Person A was using a different meaning to the word<br/>
and be flabbergasted that someone was flabbergasted. It wasn&#39;t that the<br/>
arguments weren&#39;t making sense, but they weren&#39;t making sense that<br/>
unschooling/good parents were advocating the ideas.<br/>
<br/>
For parents stuck with oodles of authoritarian examples, the concept of<br/>
helping children get what they want is difficult to understand how to put<br/>
into practice with real live children with real live life all around them.<br/>
It makes sense to &quot;ban&quot; something that bothers a child. That&#39;s what a good<br/>
parent would do. If you&#39;re using authoritarian images -- ban -- to describe<br/>
helping a child gain power over something that bothers him, then you&#39;re<br/>
reinforcing (in an unschooling context) people&#39;s idea that they do need to<br/>
take over and be the barrier between their children and the big mean world.<br/>
<br/>
But that doesn&#39;t help them help their children. It helps them be barriers.<br/>
It&#39;s more useful for getting to unschooling goals for parents to become<br/>
their children&#39;s partner. We can help our kids become aware of what they&#39;re<br/>
feelings are. We can help them find what&#39;s causing the feelings. We can help<br/>
them gain control over the causes. None of that has anything to do with us<br/>
controling them or the world for them. It&#39;s all about helping *them* control<br/>
their world.<br/>

&quot;Ban&quot; has a meaning which can&#39;t be stretched so far as to include everything <br/>
a person doesn&#39;t do.  A ban is imposed from outside SOMEhow.  <br/>

not already have been able to have made those two lists all by <br/>
ourselves. Haven&#39;t we all HEARD all those things said - in almost every <br/>
conventional parenting book or article we&#39;ve ever read?<br/>
<br/>
We had Jane Healey at the Homeschool Association of California <br/>
Conference a few years ago. She writes a lot of negative stuff about tv <br/>
and children. But she freely admitted that she&#39;d never even MET an <br/>
unschooled kid before being at our conference and she was blown away by <br/>
the ones she met at the there. NONE of the studies she cited or the <br/>
examples she gave seemed pertinent to unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
There is a HUGE difference between tv-watching in households where the <br/>
children go to school, stay for day care after school, and then get <br/>
home and have homework to do versus the tv-watching of unschooled kids <br/>
whose parents are involved and attentive and interacting with them for <br/>
many hours throughout the day. There is an even bigger difference <br/>
between unschooled kids and those whose families do not highly value <br/>
learning and don&#39;t have homes that are rich with opportunities for all <br/>
kinds of experiences and exposure, including a wide variety of <br/>
interesting and lovely and enticing print materials.<br/>
<br/>
Jane Healey didn&#39;t know or understand how unschooling families live. A <br/>
lot of what she was there promoting was like the very beginning inkling <br/>
of what unschooling families do in a full-time in-depth way. She was <br/>
trying to convince us that our kids could learn from play and that <br/>
sometimes allowing them or helping them to follow up on one of their <br/>
little interests would lead to some good development of skills or <br/>
knowledge -- she just hadn&#39;t take her OWN ideas far enough along to <br/>
realize that our entire LIVES could be based on the same premise. And <br/>
so her anti-tv stance was completely unconvincing - scientific studies <br/>
notwithstanding - they really were not relevant and implied nothing <br/>
useful to unschooling families.<br/>
<br/>
My kids and I all carry books along with us to Disneyland, to read <br/>
during waits in line or if we get tired and want a break. I was reading <br/>
the 5th Harry Potter book the other day, while the kids were in a show, <br/>
and Cruella DeVille (the character) came over and made fun of me, <br/>
reading.<br/>
<br/>
We were on the Alice in Wonderland ride and it broke down and we were <br/>
stuck there for a long time. I&#39;d not brought a book, but my kids had <br/>
theirs. Lucky kids.<br/>
<br/>
My tv-loving (Nick-at-Night watching) 13 year old was at a soccer event <br/>
yesterday. During a dull moment, she pulled out her book and was <br/>
reading (Lord of the Rings). One of the other soccer players said <br/>
(exact quote): &quot;I suppose you LIKE reading. That is so lame. You <br/>
probably don&#39;t even watch tv, either.&quot;<br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;m  writing this so that people (maybe lurkers, like me) who may be<br/>
&gt; &gt; undecided  about how much TV is good for their children can read<br/>
&gt; &gt; another<br/>
&gt; &gt; point of  view on the subject than the one most often presented on this<br/>
&gt; &gt; list.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m chuckling at the idea that anybody who is reading THIS list would<br/>
&gt; not already have been able to have made those two lists all by<br/>
&gt; ourselves. Haven&#39;t we all HEARD all those things said - in almost every<br/>
&gt; conventional parenting book or article we&#39;ve ever read?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We had Jane Healey at the Homeschool Association of California<br/>
&gt; Conference a few years ago. She writes a lot of negative stuff about tv<br/>
&gt; and children. But she freely admitted that she&#39;d never even MET an<br/>
&gt; unschooled kid before being at our conference and she was blown away by<br/>
&gt; the ones she met at the there. NONE of the studies she cited or the<br/>
&gt; examples she gave seemed pertinent to unschoolers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There is a HUGE difference between tv-watching in households where the<br/>
&gt; children go to school, stay for day care after school, and then get<br/>
&gt; home and have homework to do versus the tv-watching of unschooled kids<br/>
&gt; whose parents are involved and attentive and interacting with them for<br/>
&gt; many hours throughout the day. There is an even bigger difference<br/>
&gt; between unschooled kids and those whose families do not highly value<br/>
&gt; learning and don&#39;t have homes that are rich with opportunities for all<br/>
&gt; kinds of experiences and exposure, including a wide variety of<br/>
&gt; interesting and lovely and enticing print materials.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Jane Healey didn&#39;t know or understand how unschooling families live. A<br/>
&gt; lot of what she was there promoting was like the very beginning inkling<br/>
&gt; of what unschooling families do in a full-time in-depth way. She was<br/>
&gt; trying to convince us that our kids could learn from play and that<br/>
&gt; sometimes allowing them or helping them to follow up on one of their<br/>
&gt; little interests would lead to some good development of skills or<br/>
&gt; knowledge -- she just hadn&#39;t take her OWN ideas far enough along to<br/>
&gt; realize that our entire LIVES could be based on the same premise. And<br/>
&gt; so her anti-tv stance was completely unconvincing - scientific studies<br/>
&gt; notwithstanding - they really were not relevant and implied nothing<br/>
&gt; useful to unschooling families.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My kids and I all carry books along with us to Disneyland, to read<br/>
&gt; during waits in line or if we get tired and want a break. I was reading<br/>
&gt; the 5th Harry Potter book the other day, while the kids were in a show,<br/>
&gt; and Cruella DeVille (the character) came over and made fun of me,<br/>
&gt; reading.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We were on the Alice in Wonderland ride and it broke down and we were<br/>
&gt; stuck there for a long time. I&#39;d not brought a book, but my kids had<br/>
&gt; theirs. Lucky kids.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My tv-loving (Nick-at-Night watching) 13 year old was at a soccer event<br/>
&gt; yesterday. During a dull moment, she pulled out her book and was<br/>
&gt; reading (Lord of the Rings). One of the other soccer players said<br/>
&gt; (exact quote): &quot;I suppose you LIKE reading. That is so lame. You<br/>
&gt; probably don&#39;t even watch tv, either.&quot;<br/>

That fits with what I&#39;ve been thinking that it is badly-timed reading instructions in schools that makes reading repellant to many kids, and has the side effect of making TV look more appealing than reading to them.  In the absence of unpleasant &quot;reading education&quot; the whole picture is different.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1952551068">My BIL is here today and asked me if I happened to know what the first<br/>
television show broadcast was. So, I started looking and found some cool<br/>
links that I thought I would share.<br/>
<br/>
This is the Museum of Broadcast Television and there is a link on the<br/>
homepage to a VERY extensive encyclopedia of televison.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.museum.tv/">http://www.museum.tv/</a><br/>
<br/>
And the wikipedia article on the history of television is quite informative<br/>
as well.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_television">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_television</a><br/>
<br/>
From what I can tell from the short time I spent reading (about 1/2 hour)<br/>
the first broadcast was made in 1936 from New York to London and was just<br/>
stationary images. Then, &quot;Television broadcasting, tentatively begun prior<br/>
to the American entry to World War II in 1941, was suspended for the<br/>
duration of the war, and did not resume until the first wave of station<br/>
activations in 1946 through 1948. &quot; From what I can tell &quot;Howdy Doody&quot; was<br/>
the first broadcast televison show (aside from things like political<br/>
figures, the opening to the 1939 New York State Fair and sports programs) in<br/>
1947. &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; was not far behind in 1948.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a timeline too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-519873081">Amanda, thanks for the TV history links!  I&#39;ve added them here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/t/history">http://sandradodd.com/t/history</a><br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s good to remind our kids that things they use and know about are  <br/>
part of history as sure as anything.  If you have a kid with a new  <br/>
laptop, they probably know how much smaller and lighter and more  <br/>
powerful that computer is than a laptop of five or ten years ago.<br/>
<br/>
Polaroid pictures are no more.  They&#39;re not making the film anymore  <br/>
for Polaroid cameras.  So if you have Polaroid pictures at your house  <br/>
for any reason, even one of them, note that it&#39;s now obsolete  <br/>
technology.<br/>
<br/>
TV technology is changing bigtime this season.   Already there are  <br/>
TVs in some of our homes that can&#39;t have computer games hooked up to  <br/>
them, and VCR players are hard to find.<br/>
<br/>
My  husband tried to buy a simple CD-playing boombox.  We finally  <br/>
found some at Sears, but mostly he was finding iPod ports, not CD  <br/>
players.<br/>
<br/>
Your kids probably already know all this.  I&#39;m reminding the parents.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a little kid in the &#39;50&#39;s, I was unaware of how very new  <br/>
TV was.  I can sing the Howdy Doody themesong, though, and I remember  <br/>
well seeing that show and Romper Room on a black and white TV with a  <br/>
rounded screen, and doors closed over the screen, and it took a while  <br/>
for the TV to warm up.  You couldn&#39;t turn it on and see the picture  <br/>
in one second.  Tubes had to warm up.<br/>

clown - had some nightmares about them both, even years later. But,  <br/>
still watched them almost every Saturday morning until it went of the  <br/>
air when I was 8 years old.<br/>
<br/>
I just got a $1 DVD with four episodes of Howdy Doody on it - we  <br/>
haven&#39;t watched it yet, but the kids have heard lots of references to  <br/>
it and I knew they&#39;d be interested. One reference my musical theater  <br/>
kids are very familiar with is in Little Shop of Horrors song,  <br/>
Somewhere that&#39;s Green, when they sing, &quot;The kids watch Howdy Doody  <br/>
while the sun sets in the west&quot; and I told them that seemed a funny  <br/>
thing to say since Howdy Doody was a Saturday MORNING show. But they  <br/>
said the song says &quot;The kids PLAY Howdy Doody.&quot; The kids thought it  <br/>
was a game or something, I suppose. So - okay, I guess it can just  <br/>
mean the kids played a pretend game based on the show.<br/>

version says, &quot;The kids PLAY Howdy Doody while the sun sets in the  <br/>
west,&quot; (and you see the kids playing, not watching), but the original  <br/>
version said, &quot;The kids WATCH Howdy Doody while the sun sets in the  <br/>

as I am - must have thought that seemed wrong, too.<br/>

when his dad and I were kids tubes were in ALL our home electronic equipment <br/>
and tube testers were everywhere - if your tv or radio was having a problem <br/>
you&#39;d pull the tubes out and go plug them one by one into a tester, set the dials, <br/>
and figure out which one was bad. He&#39;s had it about a month now, he isn&#39;t <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Pleasant? From whose point of view?<br/>
<br/>
If the kids were enthralled by books or a play, would it seem great  <br/>
advice to take it away and give them what the parents deemed more  <br/>
acceptable?<br/>
<br/>
If a parent hates something her child loves, if she nurtures that  <br/>
dislike instead of stepping with open heart into her child&#39;s world,  <br/>
she misses a great opportunity to connect.<br/>
<br/>
If a parent sends a child off to entertain himself instead of  <br/>
connecting -- through books, cooking, walks, television, music, eating  <br/>
or whatever they child enjoys -- she&#39;s not going to be able to unschool.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; IT ROTS THE SENSE IN THE HEAD!<br/>
&gt; IT KILLS IMAGINATION DEAD!<br/>
&gt; IT CLOGS AND CLUTTERS UP THE MIND!<br/>
&gt; IT MAKES A CHILD SO DULL AND BLIND<br/>
&gt; HE CAN NO LONGER UNDERSTAND<br/>
&gt; A FANTASY, A FAIRYLAND!<br/>
&gt; HIS BRAIN BECOMES AS SOFT AS CHEESE!<br/>
&gt; HIS POWERS OF THINKING RUST AND FREEZE!<br/>
&gt; HE CANNOT THINK -- HE ONLY SEES!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So many say such things as though they were true.<br/>
<br/>
But where&#39;s the evidence?<br/>
<br/>
Show me an *unschooling* child whose parents are attentive to his  <br/>
needs, who create a rich and varied life that includes the choice of  <br/>
television in whatever quantity the child wants, that shows any of  <br/>
those effects?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t even know any schooled children like that. I do know some,  <br/>
including myself, that used TV to decompress after school. Being an  <br/>
introvert I watched *a lot* of TV but I got good grades, lived in the  <br/>
real world (that insisted I needed to be an extrovert and enjoy being  <br/>
around people all day), remained creative, went onto college.<br/>

1960 I believe. TV was a kid wasteland then. If you were a kid you  <br/>
*couldn&#39;t* watch that much unless the most exciting thing in the house  <br/>
was dust motes floating. There were cartoons on Saturday morning.  <br/>
There were cartoons before school time I believe. Romper Room. Later  <br/>
there were cartoons and a couple of kid shows after school. (Not sure  <br/>
when Captain Kangaroo was on.)<br/>
<br/>
The poem couldn&#39;t have come very early. It just wouldn&#39;t have been  <br/>
possible for kids to even give a hint of such behavior with what was  <br/>
on TV then.<br/>
<br/>
Roald Dahl wrote for TV between 1958-1961 for Alfred Hitchcock  <br/>
presents and then his own show of horror stories, Way Out in 1961.<br/>
<br/>
Then he disappeared from TV.<br/>
<br/>
Then from 1979-1988 he wrote and introduced shows in Tales of the  <br/>
Unexpected.<br/>
<br/>
Actually what probably made a difference was his life. During the  <br/>
period he disappeared from TV, in 1960 his 4 mo son was struck by a  <br/>
cab and developed hydrocephalus (and Roald developed a valve to help  <br/>
relieve the condition). In 1962 his 7 yo daughter died from measles.  <br/>
In 1965 his wife, Patricia Neal, suffered 3 aneurysms and he devoted  <br/>
his time to her rehabilitation. I read in an article about her that he  <br/>
was absolutely driven to get her back to her full mobility which he  <br/>
was successful at but they did divorce in 1983.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect he was a very stress camper for quite a few years. I know  <br/>
there was a very downer view of television in Matlida. Was there one  <br/>
in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory?<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1263979079">Yes, there is a boy in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory who gets sucked into <br/>
the television and is shrunk. Mike Teevee I think. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I gave a talk on television which includes a view on that poem. Sandra has <br/>
graciously housed the talk at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/schuyler/tv.">http://sandradodd.com/schuyler/tv.</a> Some of the <br/>
Roald Dahl discussion is<br/>
<br/>
&quot;But the thing he most gets wrong, the thing that is most damning about his <br/>
conclusion. He writes:<br/>
So please, oh please, we beg, we pray, <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Go throw your TV set away, <br/>
&gt;And in its place you can install <br/>
&gt;A lovely bookshelf on the wall. <br/>
&gt;Then fill the shelves with lots of books, <br/>
&gt;Ignoring all the dirty looks, <br/>
&gt;The screams and yells, the bites the kicks, <br/>
&gt;And children hitting you with sticks- <br/>
&gt;Fear not, because we promise you <br/>
&gt;That in about a week or two <br/>
&gt;Of having nothing else to do, <br/>
&gt;They’ll now begin to feel the need <br/>
&gt;Of having something to read. <br/>
&gt;And once they start—oh boy, oh boy! <br/>
&gt;You watch the slowly growing joy <br/>
&gt;That fills their hearts. They’ll grow so keen <br/>
&gt;They’ll wonder what they’d ever seen <br/>
&gt;In that ridiculous machine, <br/>
&gt;That nauseating, foul, unclean, <br/>
&gt;Repulsive television screen! <br/>
&gt;And later, each and every kid <br/>
&gt;Will love you more for what you did. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>For Roald Dahl to promise the greater love from a child when you squash their <br/>
joy and take away their happiness, for Roald Dahl to promise that a happier 2 <br/>
weeks from now is worth more than a happy now makes him both a liar and a thief. <br/>
I got this bumper sticker from the Life is Good conference this year. It isn’t <br/>
on the bumper of my car yet, but it says “Unschooling for a Better Today”. <br/>
That’s the point that Dahl missed. That I missed, that the women on the list <br/>
missed. All you have is right now. 2 weeks of misery for children who may thank <br/>
you for that suffering later isn’t anywhere near as good as sitting down with <br/>
your child and watching Sponge Bob work a 24 hour shift at the Crusty Crab and <br/>
feel your love and your relationship grow NOW! And by sitting with them and <br/>
watching and by cuddling up and laughing together and singing along with <br/>
Plankton as he sings U is for Uranium Bomb! You are showing your child more <br/>
about how valuable they are and their opinion is than you could ever do by <br/>
pushing your agenda and your visions and your desires for them to be grown with <br/>
some particular pieces of knowledge that you may presume may not be available <br/>
with a television in the house.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think the Roald Dahl poem is any pleasure. I think it is a grouchy rant. <br/>

  I have heard that before. That kids will read if they don&#39;t have TV.<br/>
That is not true for me or in my house. <br/>
My son has his own TV , a Nintendo Wii and an X-Box 360 plus his computer in <br/>
his room.<br/>
Last week he read 5 books in 2 days and I had to go get him another book so he <br/>
could finish the whole series.<br/>
I have always been an avid reader and I have always loved TV. I love to read and <br/>
watch TV.<br/>
RIght now I am reading ( well...writing) and I am watching the Twins play on TV.<br/>
THat is something I share with my husband, watching sports. He just left the <br/>
house<br/>
to do chores and I am supposed to call him about the game to keep him posted.<br/>
But anyways...I love to read and have the TV on something like that or the news.<br/>
The other night it was storming and the satellite was out and I was reading a <br/>
book that I have read a few times before<br/>
so I was complaining that I was only doing one thing and that I was used to <br/>
doing two at a time.<br/>
My 4 year old Gigi  loves being read to and does not really care for TV that <br/>
much. She does watch some shows but<br/>
if they are no on she will simply turn it off. She does not like TV as a <br/>
background noise like me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1491560891">***I don&#39;t think the Roald Dahl poem is any pleasure. I think it is a grouchy <br/>
rant.***<br/>
<br/>
You know, I&#39;ve never been able to read the whole poem straight way through. <br/>
 I&#39;ve tried a few times over the years but I found it so mean and cruel that I <br/>
couldn&#39;t ever finish it.  I remember reading one of his books allowed to my kids <br/>
once and ran into an anti-tv bit and I remember skipping over it.  I don&#39;t <br/>
usually censor things I read to my kids, but they were enjoying the book so much <br/>
and I could sense their happiness and I didn&#39;t want to bring that happy crusher <br/>
bit into the story.  It wasn&#39;t even very integral to the story to begin with. <br/>
 Not even in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, the movie, is it so much a part <br/>
of the story that it need be included.  <br/>
<br/>
Both of my kids liked both of those movies and both of them really disliked the <br/>
child shaming bits that are added in.  They had the same issue with Nanny <br/>
McPhee.  Both of my girls have watched the movie Matilda, literally hundreds of <br/>
times.  All of us can recite many bits of the movie.  We tried reading the book <br/>
and never finished it.  Roald Dahl has beautiful stories, but he adds that bit <br/>
of negative child shaming stuff into it that we really can&#39;t read his books.  I <br/>
love that the movie version of Matilda didn&#39;t have that.  The child shamers were <br/>
the bad guys.<br/>
<br/>
I like to read and watch happy empowering things!  It&#39;s one reason that we LOVE <br/>
Hayao Miyazaki, excepting Grave of the Fireflies (it&#39;s very very sad)!  That and <br/>
they have powerful girls as the central characters!  <br/>
<br/>
So I agree, it&#39;s a grouchy rant, one that gets my stomach in knots because it is <br/>
so very unhappy and cruel.  Reading these posts left me having read more of that <br/>
poem than I have ever read of it thus far.  There are just too many sad things <br/>
in the world and I try to live in a way that brings peace and happiness to the <br/>
forefront of my thoughts.  I&#39;ve seen way too many kids destroyed by the negative <br/>
cynicism of their parents and I do NOT want that for my kids.  I&#39;m their buffer <br/>
as much as possible, and my thoughts count because what I think, I act and <br/>
behave.  If my thoughts are on evil TV, how in the world can they also be on how <br/>
beautiful and wonderful the world is and how my children fit into it?<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s MY grouchy rant this afternoon!<br/>
 <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1178738366">I love Roald Dahl&#39;s sense of humor.  I loved The Twit&#39;s, Charlie and the<br/>
Chocolate Factory, Matilda, etc.  But his thinking  in that TV poem doesn&#39;t<br/>
match my experience with unschooled children and free access to television.<br/>
My kids watch some TV but probably not more than I did as a kid but without<br/>
the attached guilt.  It is just one more interest in their interesting<br/>
lives.   It was a life saver  for my youngest who was very ill this last<br/>
year.  It was the ONLY thing she could do and it saved all of our sanity.<br/>
But as soon as she was well enough, she was out doing other fun things.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My teenage girls have one friend who is 27 and they get together once a week<br/>
for Survivor night and when Survivor isn&#39;t on, for a movie night.  They all<br/>
ride horses and all love Survivor and movies.  It&#39;s been a great bonding<br/>
experience and they are friends because they share interests.<br/>
