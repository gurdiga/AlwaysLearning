<div id="ygrps-yiv-957795626">This group is old, and “no attachments allowed” seemed like a great idea in 2001.  Still, maybe.  I’ll reconsider, but memes and emoticons are not nearly the same as carefully considered words. <br/>

I’ve put Jo’s words and graph there, and can update it, but maybe not in the next 24 hours. <br/>
Today Holly was here to help with prep for her dad’s birthday party tomorrow (he’s 60 July 6),<br/>
and Devyn stayed with u all day (she’s seven), <br/>
and I cooked and cleaned, fell asleep, woke up with a horrible leg cramp, and discovered all this excitement and some not-yet-approved posts (now approved).<br/>
<br/>
 I hope the new reports fit right into the curve so that the graph won’t need to be changed on the first day. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Jo, and sorry I wasn’t available when you needed more info and help.<br/>

<br/>
One thing Alex Polikowsky had added was a note (which I’ve corrected per her clarification):<br/>
<br/>
______________<br/>
<br/>
And in the US kids are not expected to read &quot; unassisted&quot; until they are third grade or around 8 years old.<br/>
<br/>
So those kids in school would be learning to read anyway but without the baggage and pressure !<br/>
They would own their learning . They would not feel they are not smart enough if they are still not reading at 10 or 16!<br/>

But kids who won’t naturally be ready to read until later are still pressured to do the lessons. As far as the kids in school experience, the goal isn’t to effortlessly read when they’re able. The goal is to do today&#39;s lessons properly.  It isn’t an atmosphere of “It’s okay even if you can’t do this. One day you will.” It’s more likely “You’re not trying,” even if it isn’t overtly said.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1865643389">This is a comment Jo Isaac made that I’ve now added to the page:  <br/>
<br/>
“...so far the data is a perfect normal distribution/bell curve, with a median and a mode of 8.5 years, a mean of 8.02 years. Graph below (age on X axis)”<br/>
<br/>
So the age is at the bottom, and the lefthand /Y is the deviation from the mean, I think.  The “0.1” in the middle, on the vertical axis, shows where the mean is.<br/>
