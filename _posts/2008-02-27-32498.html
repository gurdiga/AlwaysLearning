<div id="ygrps-yiv-821944248">I have a 12.5 year old we are just finishing 8th grade (we do <br/>
cat/survey test because the state requires prove of scores (ohio) ok so <br/>
here is my question.  We do not test, and I do not see a need for <br/>
testing personally.....I do not feel that a child should have to take <br/>
the act or sat for college (a local college offers their own test as <br/>
they do not agree with the sat or act either), my dear dad is pushing <br/>
me to make my son take the psat test.  I do not see a purpose for this, <br/>
he says that it will prepare him for when he is up in grades in high <br/>
school.  My hubbies mom and my parents really do not agree with the way <br/>
we parent, but usually do not say much, this is ongoing though.  Advice <br/>
please?<br/>

Was your son ever in school?  Have you been doing school at home for  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2147179278">My son does not want to take the test, he does not see a reason for testing.  He does not even like taking the test for the end of year that we do in complience with our state.<br/>
  Yes he was in school until the end of 3rd grade, we pulled out and have been homeschooling for the past 4 years.  The CAT/survey test includes language and math skills.  He has always scored in the high 90&#39;s on these.<br/>

He won&#39;t be able to. Other than eligibility for the National Merit  <br/>

Ohio has 3 methods you can go by, *one* of which is testing. This group is  <br/>
good for good basic Ohio Law information (thought it is not strictly an  <br/>
unschooling group): _<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/oh-homeschool/?yguid=153376965_">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/oh-homeschool/?yguid=153376965_</a> <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-608633398">I *think* that the PSAT is pretty routinely taken in the 7th grade now and<br/>
is the basis for the Duke Talent Search and probably some other summer<br/>
programs.   My knowledge is just from reading on lists folks who are<br/>
planning or have done so.    It took *me*  years to grasp that the PSAT is<br/>
used for National Merit these days.   In my day it was a separate test.   It<br/>
does appear that one can take PSAT several times but that for National Merit<br/>
it is only the one taken &quot;junior&quot;  year that &quot;counts&quot;.<br/>
