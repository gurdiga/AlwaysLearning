<div id="ygrps-yiv-623725938">A couple of months ago (Jan) I sent a post re my eldest and asked for your advice re his behaviour and desire to be a pilot. Just wanted to let you all know that we(dh & I)took your advice, altered our budget and he has been having one flying lesson a week (considered it a cost of unschooling) since then... yesterday he flew solo for the first time - we all went to see it.. I have never seen such a wide smile on his face, and we have never been happier or prouder:) So thank you all very much for helping us to let go of the if he wants it he should pay for it view and just give him something he needs. His instructor said flying is 10% ability and 90% confidence.. something he was really short on before. So We are definite converts to if your children really have an interest in something, find a way to make it happen.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

It just makes EVERYone feel good doesn&#39;t it?!  Making things happen is one of the most awesome aspects of unschooling!  Thanks for the update!<br/>

THAT is what will change your parenting for the better, is direct  <br/>
experience with the benefits.   Reading what other people did is good  <br/>
only to give you courage to be so wonderful to your kids that you have  <br/>
that success in your own family.<br/>
<br/>
And now reading your story, others will be braver, too.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m guessing your own confidence is feeling pretty big too!<br/>
