<div id="ygrps-yiv-391807736">I know too from personal experience that it&#39;s sometimes hard to accept and<br/>
hard to be the person to rise above your own mother.  Glad I&#39;m in such good<br/>
company &lt;g&gt;<br/>

They say people will drink themselves to death. They say cigarette smoking<br/>
<br/>
will kill you. My mom consumes both still and regularly and is 70. There&#39;s<br/>
<br/>
nothing to talk about with her anymore. She&#39;s so brain damaged she can&#39;t<br/>
<br/>
remember things right and can&#39;t tell what happened the day before with any<br/>
<br/>
reliability or clarity. And the stories are usually about going to a casino<br/>
<br/>
and seeing someone she knew, anyway. And I&#39;m ashamed when it&#39;s someone I<br/>
<br/>
know too.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s sad to feel that way about your own mom. I have some really good<br/>
<br/>
memories from childhood, and one time I wrote her a long mother&#39;s day card<br/>
<br/>
with about fifty of them all lined out, after Kirby was born. I was hoping<br/>
<br/>
it would make her be a better mom to my brother. Maybe it did. For me, it<br/>
<br/>
was like a big thank you and goodbye letter, because having held up the best<br/>
<br/>
of our relationship for me and her to remember, I quit expecting any more<br/>
<br/>
good things to come of it.<br/>
<br/>
I kept a copy, and it helped make me mindful that I&#39;m building a store of<br/>
<br/>
good memories for my kids, and it&#39;s good not to cancel them back out.<br/>
<br/>
We never fight or insult each other. I just do what she needs and get gone<br/>
<br/>
politely.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-371560915">And, for someone who has embraced that lifestyle into their 70&#39;s, maybe<br/>
all the brain cells just aren&#39;t connecting anymore. Long term alcoholism<br/>
can lead to a form of dementia. Sort of hard to connect when no one&#39;s on<br/>
the phone.<br/>
