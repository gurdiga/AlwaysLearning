<br/>
19  cospgs-unschoolers <br/>

This is an email group for those who live in Colorado Springs, or areas near <br/>
to Colorado Springs, who Unschool their children.   We can discuss anything <br/>
related to homeschooling/unschooling, we can talk about meeting one another <br/>
and getting together once in awhile, we can talk about how we unschool, and <br/>
we can also encourage one another.   This can be a place where we can share <br/>
the joy of child led learning! <br/>
(Note: This is an on-line group.   We do not have scheduled meeting times or <br/>
events.   <br/>
This list is not meant to compete or take away from the other homeschool <br/>
groups in Colorado Springs.   In fact we encourage those on this list to also <br/>
join <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:SHSSG@yahoogroups.com">SHSSG@yahoogroups.com</a> (Secular Homeschool Support Group) and/or Colorado <br/>

<br/>
Beautiful.  That is a beautiful city with beautiful old houses, beautiful <br/>
scenery and beautiful weather.  Cold in the winter, for a while, but dry <br/>
cold.  Snow evaporates or melts, doesn&#39;t sit around getting filthy like it <br/>
does in more humid places.<br/>
<br/>
The only bad thing about Colorado Springs is Focus on the Family filled it up <br/>
with Christian homeschoolers.  (My personal prejudice shows again.)  One of <br/>
my dad&#39;s two brothers lived there and raised his kids (his wife finished it <br/>
off, actually, and still lives there in a GREAT old house with a perfect view <br/>
of Pike&#39;s Peak out the back window of the upstairs), so I&#39;ve been there for <br/>
family purposes and SCA purposes from time to time my whole life.  A very <br/>
good friend of mine is currently the baron of the SCA group there.  <br/>
<br/>
Not humid,  though.<br/>

<br/>
 It DOES get hot...much hotter than it did 20 years ago... it gets over 100 for at least a week a year and over 90 quite a bit.  We just moved from there...the growing heat was part of the reason...but mostly the booming population of the area.  It IS beautiful scenery there, though... and I find myself homesick sometimes! Good luck with your move!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No worries. I lived in Boulder, CO for 10 years. Colorado is not known for <br/>
its&#39; humidity. lol! The summers are warm and dry. In Boulder, we always had <br/>
about 2 weeks of &quot;too hot&quot;. The rest was beautiful. We never even had air <br/>
conditioning, although most people did.<br/>
<br/>
Colorado Springs is known for being pretty conservative, though, if that <br/>
matters to you. I think Focus on the Family originated there and there are a <br/>
lot of fundy homeschoolers. There seem to be unschoolers too, though. :o)<br/>

to drive into the mountains near there, or up to Vail or Aspen (not too far).<br/>

Sorry...no.  I lived there over 20 years... you&#39;ll get one or two big snows a year...maybe 5-6 smaller ones...and they mostly all melt the next day...Colorado is famous for a snowstorm one day and 60s the next...literally.  <br/>
You&#39;ll love the SUN...over 300 days of sun a year...second only to Florida!  <br/>
You want snow? Come up to Northern Idaho where we just moved...UGH... my hubby and daughter are in hog heaven...they love the snow.. I&#39;m sitting crying for the Colorado sunshine and warmth...hehehe...<br/>
They&#39;ve been in the 60s most of the winter, but the other day they finally got a bitter cold spell and I called my mom and *laughed!* &lt;BEG&gt;  ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2135059441">Hi, I&#39;m new on the list and was going to just listen for a week or so but<br/>
have to jump in. Got to help a fellow Brit:)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway we used to live in CS 5 years ago. I really liked it weather, temps<br/>
wise. The sky is usually blue and it&#39;s rarely grey and rainy (something you<br/>
really appreciate coming from UK).<br/>
I did find the tone of the city was generally conservative. This may not be<br/>
a problem for you but at that time I could not find a hs group that was<br/>
welcoming of nonchristians (a couple did tolerate). I tried the UU church<br/>
there and liked some of the adult stuff but it was really pushy about<br/>
separating children during the services and since I had little ones who at<br/>
that time wouldn&#39;t separate we didn&#39;t go often. Alternative things were OK.<br/>
Really nice and big &quot;health&quot; food store and restaurant. There were also<br/>
some pockets of people into alternative things. It just took awhile to find<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of fun things to do there and also Denver isn&#39;t far away as<br/>
well.<br/>
If you want land you are probably looking at Black Forest area or further<br/>
out in the flat parts (area names???) There are huge housing areas that are<br/>
rapidly being put up but of course they are packed in and all look the<br/>
same. Many companies transfered there from california so there are lots of<br/>
CA transplants -- perhaps that has helped tone down the conservatism in the<br/>
last few years:)<br/>
<br/>
HS laws were really great. I used a narrative assessment from my mom (a<br/>
special ed teacher in CA) and then I also gave annual assessments of other<br/>
kids so they wouldn&#39;t have to test.<br/>
<br/>
So anyway hi, and I will introduce myself better soon.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1250367570">&lt;&lt;&lt;Any jobs? I loathe sun. thats what happens when you grow up in England. When the big yellow hot thing appears we go out and look, it&#39;s so rare :-)<br/>
  I&#39;d actually move to Canada if I could. My old flame lives in Toronto.....<br/>
  I need more unschoolers. I&#39;m feeling unsure this week :-(<br/>
<br/>
  Shyrley&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
  Ohhh...I love the sun so much that it&#39;s hard for me to understand....but.... to each his own :-)  You might think twice about Colorado, though...I didn&#39;t make that up...it IS the 2nd sunniest state. <br/>
  Weather wise, we sound like we&#39;re in your ideal spot.... lol... jobs are more scarce here than in Denver for sure, but my hubby was working within a week and, while he did take a pay cut, the low real estate prices made it work out fine.  <br/>
  We&#39;re in Coeur d&#39;Alene, Idaho...about 100 miles from the Canadian border. You can just enter that into an internet search to get more info....we&#39;re touristy during the summer...very quiet and serene in the winter.  You might be able to find out on the internet if your hubby&#39;s field of work is available up here.... you can also check Spokane, Washington...it&#39;s just a hop, skip and a jump away...you could easily live here and work there.<br/>
  Good luck! Don&#39;t worry...you&#39;ll find the place for you!!<br/>

I&#39;ve never heard that, having lived in New Mexico so long and KNOWING it <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi, Sandra....<br/>
We actually learned that in Colorado History, and then I heard the 300+ day thing again not long ago on some TLC weather show.... it made me homesick for the sun! :-(<br/>
I don&#39;t think dryness and sunshine necessarily go hand in hand.  I think &quot;days of sun&quot; are probably gauged by a certain number of hours per day of sunshine. ... does that make sense? And I think Colorado gets it&#39;s 300+ days a year of sunshine because we often get snow for an hour or two and then sun most of the rest of the day.  The desert states ARE much hotter than Co...no doubt that you are right about that.  But Colorado VERY seldom sees rain...so that probably balances things out... <br/>
The one thing we have to be careful of, though, is the UV factor...because of the high elevation, you really need to put sunscreen on the kids ALWAYS...even (especially) in the winter!<br/>

entire Southwest is out actually. The Pacific northwest gets lots of gray <br/>
days, but not too much snow, I don&#39;t think. You may want to consider the <br/>
northeast. They get tons of snow and not &quot;too much&quot; sun. If you go far <br/>
enough north, I&#39;ll bet the summers are beautiful.<br/>

meet any. I&#39;d appreciate making contact there if you could pass on my email.<br/>
We have 4 families here now that I am aware of and a couple more who are<br/>
hs&#39;ing but aren&#39;t really hs&#39;lers as they don&#39;t want to be doing it and are<br/>
kind of resentful! 3 of the families are South African and the 4th canadian<br/>
so it&#39;s a fun mix. The other 2 US families were evacuated out last<br/>
September so our numbers are dwindling.<br/>
<br/>
The schools here finish at 1:30 or 2 and as my kids don&#39;t get up until<br/>
mid-morning there is little time when their friends aren&#39;t around<br/>
(unfortunately at times). We have a big mix of cultures which is nice<br/>
overall but can be problematic occasionally. Anyone got any hints on<br/>
dealing with 10 year olds who openly smoke? Or 12 year olds who want to<br/>
hang out at your house until midnight?  <br/>
