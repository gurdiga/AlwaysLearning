<div id="ygrps-yiv-140313012">I just found a great list.  Perhaps I&#39;m in a &quot;great list&quot; collecting  <br/>
mood, but some of these items touch on some of the questions recently  <br/>
discussed on this list.<br/>
<br/>
13 reasons why I love unschooling<br/>
<br/>
1. I can stay home with my children and learn beside them.<br/>
<br/>
2. My children get to make friends with a wide variety of people.<br/>
<br/>
3. We get to cuddle in the morning and talk quietly before we start  <br/>
the day.<br/>
<br/>
4. Despite periodic illness, my kids have perfect attendance records :).<br/>
<br/>
5. I trust my children to learn what they need to know when they need  <br/>
to know it, so they never feel &quot;behind.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
6. No school bullies live here.<br/>
<br/>
7. My children get to know me as a full person, not just as a mom.<br/>
<br/>
8. The principles of unschooling have helped me to be a better wife,  <br/>
friend, and parent.<br/>
<br/>
9. Because we unschool, my children do not view learning as a task  <br/>
that is separate from their life.<br/>
<br/>
10. My boys get the opportunity to truly bond as brothers.<br/>
<br/>
11. No cold, early morning, wet, snowy, shivery bus stop.<br/>
<br/>
12. Museums, movies, beaches, parks...all are nearly empty, cheaper,  <br/>
and easy to explore when everyone else is in school.<br/>
<br/>
13. I get to be with my kids every day, and I love watching them grow  <br/>
and change. I&#39;m not missing anything.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a biggie for me, too!!! As someone who has had years of grieving<br/>
opportunity I&#39;ve gotten more than my share of pressure about putting the<br/>
kids in school, so I could be depressed alone. WTF?? My darkest days were<br/>
*so* much brighter because I had my kids around me, depending on me, shining<br/>
their light on me (when it felt like mine had gone out) -- I have been<br/>
acutely aware that I am not just modeling &quot;how to be a mama&quot; or &quot;how to be a<br/>
woman&quot; -- I&#39;m modeling &quot;how to be a human being in these crazy circumstances<br/>
who still manages to find JOY around every turn&quot; ---That sure ain&#39;t on ANY<br/>
curriculum at ANY school!<br/>
