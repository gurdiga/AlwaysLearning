<div id="ygrps-yiv-1720263829">We have our Halloween Pictures now :)  Nathaniel was a dragon and Madeleine <br/>
was a unicorn.  You can see pictures of their costumes at <br/>
www.naturallynhkids.com/pb/wp_6a878265.html.  This was the first year that <br/>
Nathaniel seemed to have a sense of what was happening.  After a few houses, <br/>
he would call out as he turned to leave, &quot;Bye ... Happy Halloween.&quot;  <br/>
Madeleine would then call cheerfully as we walked away, &quot;Bye ... bye ... bye <br/>
... bye ... bye ... bye ...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The earlier part of the day was rather exhausting!  My in-laws insisted on <br/>
having us drive to their house so they could see the kids in their costumes. <br/>
  Of course, they only had limited times available in their schedules.  So, <br/>
we ended up going over in the early afternoon and then waiting for the <br/>
city&#39;s events to start.  The kids enjoyed the hay ride, story time, and face <br/>
painting.  The pictures with Big Bird and Cookie Monster were too <br/>
overwhelming.  We also ended up waiting in line for 20 minutes at the fire <br/>
station.  That would have been fine if there had been fire engines inside to <br/>
explore but it was just a food line for pizza, which my kids couldn&#39;t eat <br/>
anyway.  So, that was a bit frustrating.  Also, we had just spent 10 minutes <br/>
waiting in line for the hay ride.  This was compounded by the fact that the <br/>
family waiting behind us were not very understanding with their 2-year-old <br/>
who was having a hard time waiting in line, especially since his dad <br/>
insisted that he was not to be held.<br/>
<br/>
It was fun seeing a lot of families we know all dressed up in costumes :)<br/>
