<div id="ygrps-yiv-956988115">I need to vent and I could also use some support!<br/>
Recently we had a visit from an old friend, a person who I thought<br/>
shared my belief system.  Now I see that she and I have very different<br/>
approaches to raising children!  She thinks my daughter, Lauren (8),<br/>
needs to be in school.  Here is part of an e-mail she sent to me: <br/>
<br/>
&quot;My concerns regarding Lauren involve Ian as well as what you and Tim<br/>
can reasonably manage as parents. Not only from the financial point of<br/>
view, but also the time and energy drain on you, and problems with<br/>
Ian&#39;s safety and well-being. This is what prompted my discussion with<br/>
Lauren about the golden rule: you know - the one I was asked to<br/>
apologize to Lauren over because I &#39;hurt her feelings&#39; and &#39;yelled&#39; at<br/>
her. Interesting having a 7-year-old in charge, eh? Maybe not so much<br/>
for me.<br/>
<br/>
As your good friend, and someone who has successfully invested a lot<br/>
in raising two daughters (that are a pleasure for other people to be<br/>
around - don&#39;t you agree?) I offer you the best advice I know of: put<br/>
Lauren in school (while you have this small window of opportunity).<br/>
You don&#39;t have to re-invent the wheel of her education, fortunately:<br/>
take advantage of a system that knows how to teach reading, and when<br/>
Lauren&#39;s illiteracy problem is solved you can always consider other<br/>
options.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if Lauren is brought into line with the structure and discipline<br/>
she requires, and if she can learn to relate to others in a healthy<br/>
way (rather than constantly manipulating), then raising Ian will be so<br/>
much easier. I really want the best for all of you...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Can you believe her?  What is she thinking...I didn&#39;t ask for her<br/>
advice.  I am so irritated and taken aback by her message that I don&#39;t<br/>
know what to think.  Apparently she has an authoritative approach to<br/>
children and I never knew this before.<br/>
Any thoughts?  How would you handle this?  I&#39;m thinking the best<br/>
response may be none at all.<br/>
Thanks!,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1185791746">Isn&#39;t it wonderful to hear what other people think?  Tell her &#39;thanks! if we need any advice, we&#39;ll ask you!  My kids are a joy to be around, too!  School isn&#39;t the answer!  When did a 7 year old become  &#39;illiterate!&#39;, except for in public schools, where &#39;illiteracy&#39; abounds all the way through high school?   And why would p.s. be the  answer ? Live your life, I&#39;ll be doing mine.  Thanks for your concern, Anna.&#39;<br/>
   <br/>
  She doesn&#39;t hold any control over you.  Tell her mind her own beeswax.  Dont get upset.  There are tons of &#39;experts&#39;, You are an expert of your kids, she of hers, maybe.<br/>

<br/>
This isn&#39;t as helpful as other things in that post.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of parents think they&#39;re experts on their kids.<br/>
Lots of other parents make that statement.<br/>
They&#39;ll say &quot;You know more about your kids than anyone.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yet I&#39;m sure all of us could think of lots of parents who know diddly  <br/>
about kids or their own kids, and kids who WISH thier parents cared  <br/>
or knew something really, truly, directly about them as individuals.<br/>
<br/>
Some parents thing seven year olds should be literate for example.   <br/>
Probably they  haven&#39;t even though of what &quot;literate&quot; literally  <br/>
means.  They&#39;re just parotting a phrase.<br/>
<br/>
Please be careful of parotting phrases.<br/>

But, if this was a friend I might want to keep, I&#39;d say something like:<br/>

  &quot;I&#39;m sure you wrote out of genuine concern and, for that, I thank  <br/>
you.  I realize that you are giving your honest opinion, I understand  <br/>
your point of view, and I now ask that you understand that I have  <br/>

do not expect you to agree with me. I have chosen an unconventional  <br/>
path, and I understand that this may be difficult for you to  <br/>

us and will refrain from critiquing my parenting choices from now on.  <br/>
If not, then we will not be able to remain friends.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-330913423">I read the email twice. I think she has an extremely haughty tone. One of *I am so obviously a better parent than you* . I don&#39;t know you,I don&#39;t know this person. But I can say that any *friend* who sent me an email like this would cause me to seriously consider what, if anything we possibly had in common. I would also wonder,and ask her personally why she couldn&#39;t have shared these concerns in person,or at least on the phone. <br/>
  Also maybe ask yourself what in the email really sends you over the edge and look closely at why if you can. I know in my own 46 years of life there have been times when someone dear to me has brought something to the fore and my defensive reaction has been because there was truth in there somewhere. <br/>
  I  am not implying that you have anything to be defensive about. Just giving you another way to look at the email and it&#39;s contents.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1032076399">I like what Pam says here:<br/>
<br/>

&gt;&gt;If not, then we will not be able to remain friends.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And I would make the small change to the line &quot;will refrain from critiquing<br/>
my parenting choices from now on&quot; to &quot;will refrain from critiquing my<br/>
children and my parenting choices from now on&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
If you didn&#39;t care about keeping her as a friend, I wrote this...probably<br/>
too long, but may be helpful:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It is &lt;sad, upsetting, irritating, fill in the blank&gt; to me that you have<br/>
judged my children and my parenting in the way that you did. It is clear<br/>
that we think differently about parenting, and just as I am sure you have<br/>
reasons for making the choices that you have made, so do I. Both of our<br/>
ideas can be strongly supported with studies and evidence. I know the course<br/>
that you recommend intimately. My decisions have come from personal<br/>
experience, many others&#39; personal experiences, from seeing the results of<br/>
that course on the majority of the population, and from seeing many families<br/>
who have chosen to give freedom and respect to their children over many<br/>
years. My family&#39;s journey is an exciting one, not based in the box of &quot;one<br/>
size fits all&quot;, a box that has created misery for many, many years.<br/>
<br/>
You may not see my children as &quot;pleasures&quot; to be with, and that is<br/>
okay...they are growing and learning, and I don&#39;t know if they will ever<br/>
meet your standards for &quot;pleasure&quot;. I do not believe that children should be<br/>
expected to always be pleasures to be with. I mean, sure, that would serve a<br/>
great purpose for us adults, but I&#39;m pretty sure that is not what is in<br/>
their best interest. My kids  are learning about society and expectations<br/>
over time, with loving guidance along the way.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I like people to be themselves, whether they are pleasant or<br/>
not. It seems that adults are not always expected to be pleasant. While it<br/>
is my hope that my children will grow into people that are great to be<br/>
around, the process is not automatic and may not always look pretty to<br/>
everyone. I have no desire to choose false beauty over real life and<br/>
learning. My kids are learning what is acceptable in this society over time,<br/>
how to respect by being respected,  compassion by being well taken care of<br/>
and by being supported...it&#39;s all happening. It isn&#39;t a lesson that is<br/>
learned with a quick scary look, or yell, or swat...it is learned over time<br/>
with respectful behavior and guidance.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;ve chosen a path where my kids are learning about the world and who<br/>
they are through freedom, support, and guidance. As their passions and<br/>
interests are being supported and fed, as they have the freedom to explore<br/>
and daydream, as they have supportive adults to help them along the way,<br/>
they learn in peace and contentedness. I understand that this isn&#39;t an<br/>
authoritative or conventional approach. I do not believe in an authoritative<br/>
approach in most situations. I believe the authoritative approach causes<br/>
more damage than health, especially in relationships.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if this is a deal-breaker or not with our friendship. I have<br/>
valued you as a friend, and at the same time am not interested in this kind<br/>
of advice, nor in bringing discontent into my family. I will however be very<br/>
happy to ask for it if needed. I am happy to help you with suggestions or<br/>
advice at any time as well.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Of course, not responding at all is always an option. She is an example of<br/>
someone in the typical mindset, and there are many many people like her. But<br/>
maybe you will actually have a positive influence on her if you do respond.<br/>
You never know.<br/>

..... take advantage of a system that knows how to teach reading, and when<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess she has never heard of John Taylor Gatto. The person who wrote this <br/>
doesn&#39;t know anything about natural learning, and actually doesn&#39;t know much <br/>
about schools either or brain development. Her assessments of educational <br/>
issues, and recommendations thereof, can safely be ignored I think.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; the time and energy drain on you, &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I guess she has little faith in you, although she clearly intends her <br/>
remarks as loving.<br/>
<br/>
..&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;....Lauren&#39;s illiteracy problem is solved .....<br/>
the structure and discipline<br/>
she requires, and if she can learn to relate to others in a healthy<br/>
way (rather than constantly manipulating) .....then raising Ian will be so<br/>
 much easier. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So she is being really offensive about your daughter, clearly sees her as <br/>
flawed, and in effect is suggesting that you sacrifice your dd to the school <br/>
system in order to focus on someone I am assuming is her brother. I don&#39;t <br/>
think I would want someone who had those kinds of thoughts about Jayn <br/>
spending any time with her.<br/>
<br/>
Is your dd &quot;constantly manipulating&quot;? Would you like to talk about that idea <br/>
at all? I don&#39;t think children enact  manipulating  strategies unless they <br/>
feel powerless. People here have lots of ideas for helping children feel <br/>
empowered and make better choices.<br/>
<br/>
Is Lauren hurting Ian in some way? Would you like to talk about that? People <br/>
here have lots of ideas for helping with sibling conflicts.<br/>
<br/>
Are you financially drained? This is a topic that has been much canvassed on <br/>
several of the boards at www.unschooling.info/forum where there are lots of <br/>
suggestions for cutting expenditures and still having a fun, enriched <br/>
Unschooling life.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like the Golden Rule - at least not the Western Christian version.<br/>
<br/>
In many of the world&#39;s great philosophies and religions the Rule is <br/>
expressed as &quot;don&#39;t do to others that which you wouldn&#39;t like done to you&quot;. <br/>
This I can see the sense of. Don&#39;t give pompous unsolicited advice expressed <br/>
as a bunch of &quot;you statements&quot; if you wouldn&#39;t like receiving it yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Apparently the Bible says roughly &quot;Do unto others that which you would wish <br/>
done to you&quot;. I was told this by the Chaplain of my Anglican high school as <br/>
being a wonderful and special way of expressing the Golden Rule. This is the <br/>
Rule I have a problem with.<br/>
<br/>
I wish it said &quot;Do unto others that which *they want* done unto them&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I may want some quiet time alone if I&#39;m tired and overwhelmed, but you may <br/>
want to be hugged and brought a pot of tea and a listening ear. See what I <br/>
mean? If I did what to you what I would prefer, you might feel simply <br/>
abandoned.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I really want the best for all of you...&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
....&quot;as long as it is the same as what I would want for myself.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I guess your friend would want a bunch of judgments and suggestions made to <br/>
her, since she apparently likes the Golden Rule.<br/>
<br/>
How about:<br/>
Your concern is appreciated.<br/>
Your approval is unnecessary.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like conflict or confrontation. I would probably just not pick up <br/>
the phone when it was her, until she stopped calling. I don&#39;t have many real <br/>
friends, but those I do have are Golden - and the vast majority of them are <br/>
Unschoolers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1130490552">I don&#39;t think it would be possible for me NOT to respond to the <br/>
message and be around that person again.  I really do not like <br/>
confrontation, but I had a couple of similar (though not quite as <br/>
harsh) messages from family members when my daughter was around 6 or <br/>
7 years old.  Not so much that I needed to send her to school, but <br/>
definitely that she needed more discipline/structure/control and <br/>
that she shouldn&#39;t &quot;be in charge&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
It is a little funny when I look back because when Darcy was a baby <br/>
& toddler, these same people asked me for advice because she ate <br/>
well, slept well, and was &quot;smart&quot;, meaning she walked & talked <br/>
earlier than average.  Then, when Darcy got a little older and was <br/>
very spirited, VERY talkative, impulsive and easily frustrated, they <br/>
stopped asking me for advice and started giving it to me whether I <br/>
asked for it or not.  Their kids weren&#39;t all these things, so I must <br/>
be doing something wrong.  <br/>
<br/>
Does your friend have any real reason to believe that your daughter <br/>
would be like hers even if she went to school?  Of course not.  This <br/>
doesn&#39;t even make any sense.  They are individuals.  They have their <br/>
own personalities.  Even if her children are a pleasure to be with, <br/>
does that mean that you want your daughter to be like them?  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe you didn&#39;t know how your friend could be because she didn&#39;t <br/>
have much reason to show it before.  I don&#39;t know her or her <br/>
children, but some children are naturally compliant, quiet, and easy <br/>
to parent.  If hers are like this, perhaps she thinks that&#39;s how <br/>
kids are.  <br/>
<br/>
Truthfully, the thing that bothered me most about the message was <br/>
that she put &quot;hurt her feelings&quot; in quotation marks, as if that was <br/>
a ridiculous notion or could not be &quot;true&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
Good luck.  I hope you find the words.<br/>

things because they care.<br/>
<br/>
Think of how much courage it took to write that.<br/>
<br/>
Your choices are so far off of what she believes must be true in life  <br/>
that she&#39;s having a hard time wrapping her mind around why you&#39;re  <br/>
doing them. The only conclusion she can come to is that there is so  <br/>
much you don&#39;t understand so she needs to explain it to you.<br/>
<br/>
Think about how you would react if a friend started getting involved  <br/>
in a cult. They seemed outwardly happy about their discoveries, but  <br/>
you were certain that this would lead to rack and ruin. Wouldn&#39;t you  <br/>
be confused by how completely your friend was ignoring what was  <br/>
sensible? Wouldn&#39;t you want to try to save them by pointing out the  <br/>
obvious?<br/>
<br/>
How would you approach such a friend?<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t make her change her mind. You can offer to share your  <br/>
research with her so you can discuss it. You can keep repeating &quot;I&#39;ve  <br/>
done a lot of research and thought deeply about this. If you&#39;d like  <br/>
to read, I&#39;d be happy to discuss it with you.&quot; But until she makes  <br/>
the effort to understand, it won&#39;t be worth the time to talk about it.<br/>
<br/>
View her as someone who cares deeply but who just doesn&#39;t understand.<br/>

I definitely think short is better than long.  The above is clear and  <br/>
many have recommended and probably used it.<br/>
<br/>
Another short not-too-confrontational way to approach it is to use  <br/>
some version of<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We did think of all these things before we made our decisions.  If  <br/>
you&#39;d like to read some of what we&#39;ve read, here&#39;s a list.  (or  <br/>
here&#39;s the name of a single book, or here in physical-person is a  <br/>
real book).  When you&#39;ve read this, if you&#39;d like to discuss it  <br/>
further, I&#39;d be glad to.&quot;<br/>

That answer is a volley back into her court that requires her to  <br/>
research before she says another word.<br/>

I lost friends who have either since come back around or have not out  <br/>

I never told them off, I just stated my position briefly and kindly,  <br/>
or I turned the other cheek.  Sometimes I would say &quot;We&#39;ll see how it  <br/>
goes; you might be right.&quot; (While thinking &#39;I doubt you&#39;re right,  <br/>
bitch,&#39; but not saying it.)  Always, in the early years, I would say  <br/>
&quot;If this stops working, we&#39;ll do something else.&quot;   And that might be  <br/>
worth saying, too.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are fine.  None of the kids of those others (if they even had  <br/>
kids) are as calm or together.  Some are older than Kirby and they&#39;re  <br/>
still treated as and act like teens.  Sulky, disregarded, insulted,  <br/>
belittled teens.  One went through school and pressures and now has a  <br/>
job working in the same office where her mom works.  If only they&#39;d  <br/>
let her start doing that when she was 14 or 15 she&#39;s be a lot further  <br/>
along now and less resentful, and maybe less (I&#39;m just guessing)  <br/>
embarrassed about having believed all the promises of the glory of  <br/>
finishing school and some college (I think she did a couple of  <br/>
years).  The job she&#39;s doing involves things she learned at home  <br/>
messing with computers.  No doubt her mom looks at any scrap of math  <br/>
or writing or reading and assures her school enabled  her to do that.<br/>
<br/>
I do NOT think you should point these things out to your friend at  <br/>
all, but I&#39;m stating them to reassure you that lots of us have been  <br/>
there, with some self-righteous friend whose kid is sitting up  <br/>
straight while ours are running around touching and thinking and  <br/>
asking questions.  There will likely come a day when theirs is still  <br/>
sullenly still in the same chair while ours are sitting brightly and  <br/>
still curiously in another chair vainly trying to engage them in  <br/>
happy, intelligent conversation.  Or ours who were once their good  <br/>
friends are in another, better social sphere altogether.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-810132131">I&#39;m so glad this topic has come up.  My hubby just told me that his<br/>
mother called him at work a few weeks ago.  She wanted to let him know<br/>
 how concerned she was that we were not sending our children to public<br/>
school.  That they would NOT be prepared to take the SAT&#39;s or go to<br/>
college (they&#39;re 8 and 10).  He basically just replied &quot;are you done,<br/>
thanks, gotta go.&quot;  The thing is I thought she was always supportive<br/>
of our choices (our kids are wonderful...at least I think so!) so this<br/>
has kind of taken me be surprise.<br/>
<br/>
I know it took him a while to tell me because the relationship between<br/>
my MIL and myself isn&#39;t the best, and the fact that he really doesn&#39;t<br/>
care what she thinks about our choices.  Her and my husbands<br/>
relationship isn&#39;t the best either but it&#39;s been like that since he&#39;s<br/>
been 4!  She is very manipulative person. <br/>
<br/>
Interesting,DD (10), mentioned to me last week that all Grandma talks<br/>
about is public school and Jesus.  My kids don&#39;t spend much time w/<br/>
their grandparents anymore, but have always enjoyed them in the past. <br/>
<br/>
If this woman was not my MIL, I would care less what she thinks.  I<br/>
realize I am raising my children in a way that isn&#39;t even close to<br/>
resembling the way she did.  Maybe she takes that personally? Maybe I<br/>
could never make her understand, maybe she doesn&#39;t even want to<br/>
understand.  Otherwise maybe she would have come to me instead of my<br/>
hubby?<br/>
<br/>
So, do I just say nothing since she didn&#39;t approach me?  Or do I say<br/>
something like &quot;I heard about your concerns, if you&#39;re really<br/>
interested in learning why we believe the way we do, I&#39;d recommend<br/>
such and such.&quot;  And what would you recommend??  I mean I&#39;ve been<br/>
researching for years...is there just one magically article to that<br/>
might help her understand?  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks all for the great advice on this topic!!<br/>

<br/>
Personally (more a confession than a recommendation), I would not  <br/>
hesitate to use that against her if she got in my face.  I would be  <br/>
glad to say &quot;We&#39;re hoping for a better relationship with our kids  <br/>
than you had with yours.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I never said that to my mother in law, but would&#39;ve if she&#39;d said  <br/>
any  more than she did.  I was good at winning sparring moments with  <br/>
her, so it never went past the first comment many times.  I never  <br/>
said it to her, but I showed it to her in epic technicolor, and am  <br/>
not through yet.  By the time her kids were 21 they were all off  <br/>
doing something or other fairly questionable.  Keith was living with  <br/>
me and my first husband, after he got back from his return court date  <br/>
in New Jersey.  He spent Christmas his 21st year at my house, saying  <br/>
he had nowhere to go.  His parents lived four hours away, I found out  <br/>
later, and eventually understood why he wouldn&#39;t consider that ANY  <br/>
kind of fun Christmas.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I am raising my children in a way that isn&#39;t even close to<br/>

<br/>
No doubt she does.<br/>
I would take it personally, I&#39;m sure, if my kids went to smacking  <br/>
their kids around and putting them in daycare for no pressing  <br/>
reason.  I probably wouldn&#39;t keep totally quiet and calm about it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Maybe I<br/>
could never make her understand, maybe she doesn&#39;t even want to<br/>
understand. Otherwise maybe she would have come to me instead of my<br/>

<br/>
Maybe she just wanted to put a dig in at him, and not risk losing an  <br/>
argument.<br/>
<br/>
-=Do I just say nothing since she didn&#39;t approach me? -=-<br/>

That&#39;s what I&#39;d do.<br/>

Very afraid.<br/>
<br/>
If what we do turns out to work, then they will have to take  <br/>
responsibility for their own choices, and will also have to rethink  <br/>
all the complacent thoughts they have about their own upbringing.   <br/>
That is a LOT of uncomfortable work, and we could avoid that for them  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>This reminded me of something that happened with us a few months <br/>
back.  I have a friend who is very much invested in the schooling <br/>
system.  She absolutely hates public schools, for many of the same <br/>
reasons that I do, but where we differ is that she still feels that <br/>
kids must be taught.  At heart she is a teacher, she just feels <br/>
schools don&#39;t teach well.<br/>
<br/>
There is no way for her to understand what we do and I simply don&#39;t <br/>
go there with her.  When my older daughter was young she really liked <br/>
this friend.  Little kids really like her, her expectations are very <br/>
clear and there isn&#39;t any misunderstandings with her.  As my daughter <br/>
grew, the expectations stayed the same and there were many <br/>
misunderstandings because this friend of mine expected my now older <br/>
daughter to behave a certain way that wasn&#39;t reasonable or respectful <br/>
of my daughter.<br/>
<br/>
It felt belittling to her and she stopped wanting to be around this <br/>
person at all.  I didn&#39;t force her.  When I started meeting her at a <br/>
local coffee shop Chamille started to want to come, not to see this <br/>
person, but to go to the cafe.<br/>
<br/>
I feel oddly uncomfortable with my daughter and this friend <br/>
together.  One day when we were at the cafe, Chamille asked if I <br/>
could retreive her coffee from the counter for her.  I asked her to <br/>
do it please and she got really upset at this, so I went and got it <br/>
for her.  Later I asked her to get something for me from the car and <br/>
she said &quot;no&quot;, and went on to say, &quot;now you know how it feels&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
That was so incredibly powerful.  The thing is, it didn&#39;t make me <br/>
mad, it made me think.  My friend was just beside herself over the <br/>
whole thing letting me know how disrespectful my daughter is/was and <br/>
that I needed to make her be more respectful.  She went on about it <br/>
explaining all that I was doing wrong as a parent, etc etc.  I <br/>
listened politely and told her I would deal with the situation.<br/>
<br/>
This is what happened in the car on the way home... I dealt with the <br/>
situation.  I let my daughter know that she was absolutely right and <br/>
that I indeed had behaved disrespectfuly towards her by not getting <br/>
her what she had politely asked me to get, and then asking her to do <br/>
something for me and expecting her to do it, when I had been <br/>
unwilling to do what she had asked, even though I eventually did.<br/>
<br/>
I think we were both crying about it because it was such an intense <br/>
moment.  She had every right to be upset with me, especially after <br/>
sitting there listening to this friend of mine lecture me about <br/>
respect and how to make my daughter respect me and others.  My <br/>
daughter has absolutely no respect for this woman.  However, I think <br/>
she has a great deal of respect for me, primaraly because I have a <br/>
great deal of respect for her.  <br/>
<br/>
We made an agreement about this friend of mine.  I told my daughter <br/>
that she will always come first, and that my friend is an adult and <br/>
can deal with it.  She never ever has to come with me to see this <br/>
person, and if I need to cancel with my friend because my daughter <br/>
needs me, then I won&#39;t hesitate to do so, even if it creates <br/>
weirdness in the friendship.<br/>
<br/>
Chamille and I had a long hearfelt conversation about all this.  She <br/>
agreed that if for some reason she had to be around this person that, <br/>
if for whatever reason, she was feeling disrespected, she would pull <br/>
me aside and discuss it away from this person instead of in front of <br/>
her so that it wouldn&#39;t insue into another lecture of respect.  She <br/>
agreed to smile politely and to try to keep her mouth shut and ignore <br/>
her as much as possible, and that we would plan in advance to bring <br/>
headphones and drawing paper and such.  <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the thing though, I haven&#39;t seen this friend for many months <br/>
because my kids come first.  I have no desire to see this friend <br/>
after what happened the last time.  I can choose to hang out with, <br/>
and I can choose who will benefit me the most in my life and the path <br/>
that I have chosen.  It came down to a choice of friend vs daughter, <br/>
and my kids know without a doubt I will ALWAYS choose them.<br/>
<br/>
I may have to see this person again down the road.  After all we have <br/>
known each other for a long time and do have some things in common, <br/>
including other friends.  I just don&#39;t have to make it every week or <br/>
every other week.  I can make it once in a great while and my kids <br/>
don&#39;t have to come.<br/>
<br/>
What it came to, was a better understanding between myself and my <br/>
daughter, and a better understanding of people and how to deal with <br/>
them.  We were able to take a &quot;bad&quot; situation and make it a good one.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-851410068">Here is what I mean Sandra.<br/>
  For me,government school is not best for my children.  My daughter may feel,with the many circumstances that come along in life that gov. school is the best for her children at that particular time. This could come about after reading/researching the pros and cons of either gov. school or homeschool. I may not agree with her but because I trust her to make the best decision she can make for her children I most certainly will and do respect her.<br/>
   <br/>
  I think it&#39;s kind of like denominations. I may not want to be your denomination but I can still respect your choice to make that denomination yours. I think respect can be given even when you don&#39;t agree. It opens the doors wide for change,or not.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I AM a grandma now - and it IS very hard to see your child making <br/>
choices for his children (your grandchildren) that you don&#39;t agree with. <br/>
I try very hard to support his right to make his own choices, while <br/>
still trying to gently remind him that there are other choices <br/>
available. It is a very thin rope to balance on with my own son, let <br/>
alone with his wife - I&#39;m sure they have had many a moan about me in the <br/>
last 5 years!<br/>
<br/>
I think the best thing for both parents and grandparents to remember is, <br/>
all of us love those babes and want what&#39;s best for them. If we have <br/>
different views on what&#39;s best, that&#39;s all it is - different views on <br/>
what&#39;s best. Remember that it&#39;s all based on love and concern.<br/>
<br/>
But sometimes we grandparents need to be reminded that however much we <br/>
love those babes, we are not their parents, and that the decision to do <br/>
something a particular way doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that our way was <br/>
worse: different times, different situations, different choices, <br/>
different parents, different children. I know my mother took everything <br/>
I did differently as a criticism of her parenting - but it wasn&#39;t always <br/>
(was sometimes tho &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
It is hard being a grandparent - so much love, but no decision making <br/>
rights, no control, not even the right to see them. I worry myself sick <br/>
at times.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1494450846">I too am glad that this topic has come up.  Over the last few months  <br/>
I have been mulling over a possible post, and just haven&#39;t gotten  <br/>
there, but this is opening the door for me.  I think part of the  <br/>
reason that I have hesitated to post is that I still feel unclear  <br/>
about what my specific issue is, but here goes anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Lately I have just been feeling like we have so many differences  <br/>
between us and everyone that we know (except our unschooling  <br/>
friends), and I have been wondering if I (because it&#39;s me driving the  <br/>
unschooling, right) am going to alienate everyone we know because of  <br/>
our &quot;crazy&quot; choices.  Here are some scenarios and background info.<br/>
<br/>
Our oldest is 8.5, and definitely not reading, not even a small list  <br/>
of words, actually.  She recognizes things that she sees, like logos,  <br/>
etc., but if they are presented in another way, she doesn&#39;t recognize  <br/>
them at all.  I&#39;ve read on this list, I&#39;ve read Frank Smith, and I  <br/>
really feel comfortable that she is going to get to it in her own  <br/>
way.  She&#39;s always done things kind of slowly and waited until real  <br/>
mastery was possible before she commits to doing them fully.  Because  <br/>
of that, I trust that she will be there, and do just fine when it  <br/>
works for her.  I also can see how much information she (and my other  <br/>
two children also) absorb from the world without even needing to  <br/>
read.  They notice everything and are so conscious of the visual  <br/>
world around them, it is remarkable to me.  But, on the reading  <br/>
front, we are definitely coming up on those situations, either with  <br/>
relatives, or with non-unschooling friends, or casual acquaintances,  <br/>
where there is a slightly uncomfortable pause and look when they  <br/>
realize that our 8.5 yo does not yet know how to read.  With the  <br/>
family and close folks, I feel relatively comfortable explaining the  <br/>
detail of the situation, our philosophy, etc.; it is those more  <br/>
casual encounters (with acquaintances at dinner, with the lifeguard  <br/>
at the pool, etc.) where I need some brief statement that I can make  <br/>
that keeps me and the situation positive, does not require a detailed  <br/>
lecture on the whole natural learning philosophy, and is not  <br/>
uncomfortable for my daughter to hear.  Generally, when it seems to  <br/>
make sense, I say something like &quot;oh yes, homeschooled children who  <br/>
learn to read naturally at their own pace often do not read until  <br/>
between 8 and 12 years old.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Several months ago, I realized that two of my oldest friends from  <br/>
college might be too difficult for me to see and talk to on a regular  <br/>
basis.  I feel very uncomfortable in the presence of their sometimes  <br/>
negative, heavily directive parenting.  Aside from the parentinng  <br/>
style, they both have boys who are diagnosed with certain currently  <br/>
common disorders and in numerous types of therapy, but seem to me to  <br/>
just be maybe a little unique or needing more individual attention,  <br/>
and the treatment is all to have them fit into a school or preshool  <br/>
box (sorry, I do not mean to create controversy here, it just seems  <br/>
to me that I do not know a little boy who is not diagnosed with  <br/>
something these days, and it is making me skeptical.)   One of the  <br/>
friends and I discussed that our different views on parenting (she  <br/>
expressed reading concerns; I did not share my views on disorders)  <br/>
were causing some stress in the relationship, and I told her that if  <br/>
it was causing too much stress for her, I would understand if she  <br/>
wanted to drop our friendship.  I also tried to gently share that I  <br/>
was really seeing so many great possible benefits about the learning  <br/>
and relationship style that we were exploring, that I would love it  <br/>
if she could see those too.  We haven&#39;t really talked since that  <br/>
conversation, and it is kind of eating at me.  This conversation was  <br/>
extremely difficult for me, as I typically avoid controversy and try  <br/>
to keep to the positive side of things, but it seemed like it had to  <br/>
happen.<br/>
<br/>
My husband&#39;s family is another situation.  Almost every single person  <br/>
is an educator, and with that background, obviously our choice was  <br/>
different.  However, I think most of the folks looked at my husband  <br/>
and I and said, well, they were both reasonably bright and motivated,  <br/>
they must have some idea of what they&#39;re doing.  On the other hand,  <br/>
my sil is an extremely dictatorial parent, barking out orders to her  <br/>
11 and 9 year olds, about everything from what they need to do next,  <br/>
to what they can and can&#39;t eat, etc.  It is so painful for me to  <br/>
observe, and I could almost cry for the lost potential of her  <br/>
children, especially her son, who receives extremely negative  <br/>
treatment.  Recently they visited and stayed with us for several  <br/>
days, along with my mil, her older daughter and boyfriend, and their  <br/>
other children.  We joined some other relatives for a dinner at our  <br/>
botanic garden, and while we were walking around afterward, my  <br/>
husband overheard our sil commenting to his cousin that she told my  <br/>
3yo that he &quot;couldn&#39;t do such and such with Auntie Sarah around.&quot;  My  <br/>
husband did not hear the entire conversation, but thought it referred  <br/>
to a time where my son might have been jumping on piled up air  <br/>
mattresses while she was in the room reading, and he inferred that  <br/>
she thought he needed someone to tell him a strong &quot;NO&quot;.  I can tell  <br/>
that it seems strange to others in their family that I spend so much  <br/>
time talking, acknowledging emotions and negotiating with all of our  <br/>
children, but probably mostly with the 3yo.  This sil has in the past  <br/>
also asked kind of point blank questions of my daughter about what  <br/>
she&#39;s been learning.  This sil suggested during a car ride with her  <br/>
and my mil, that our daughters should come to visit them alone for a  <br/>
week next summer.  I could barely say anything, because I felt so  <br/>
worried for them that any such visit might include probing of their  <br/>
knowledge base, lessons in how to listen and follow orders, and also  <br/>
how to be responsible for cleaning up your own messes.  On the other  <br/>
hand, I felt like I would seem like an ogre of a mother to deprive  <br/>
them of the opportunity to have a week of fun and excitement with  <br/>
their cousins.<br/>
<br/>
I also fear that if it becomes widespread knowledge among his other  <br/>
relatives that our oldest is not yet reading, some sort of pressure  <br/>
will start.  When we first mentioned that our daughter might not read  <br/>
until 8 or so, dh&#39;s mother said &quot;well I certainly hope it doesn&#39;t go  <br/>
that far&quot;.  She seemed okay at 5, 6, 7, but with each year, I am sure  <br/>
it will become more of a concern.<br/>
<br/>
Aside from the reading and the toddler negotiating, there is always  <br/>
the background hum of some level of guilt that our home can be very  <br/>
messy (and the kids are not required to pick things up, which I can  <br/>
tell creates some discomfort, even with our closest friends), and I  <br/>
often feel like I have to make some explanatory comment to whomever  <br/>
might be coming to our door, whether they be our building engineer, a  <br/>
neighbor in need of something, or friends.  I don&#39;t know why I can&#39;t  <br/>
get over the mentality of guilt - I have so many valid arguments  <br/>
against it, but try as I might, it does crop up.  We did do major  <br/>
cleanup for our relatives, but with so many people living there, it  <br/>
was messy, and I still didn&#39;t go around cleaning everything every  <br/>
minute.  My sil somehow made a comment about how she hates clutter,  <br/>
and I wondered if that was somehow directed at me, because our house  <br/>
is cluttery by most people&#39;s standards.  Perhaps though, I might have  <br/>
been too sensitive.<br/>
<br/>
Oh yes, our 3yo also can frequently be found running around in our  <br/>
home naked, and that definitely puts some people off, so I&#39;m feeling  <br/>
like it&#39;s created some awkwardness, despite the fact that I can say  <br/>
that it&#39;s easier for him while he&#39;s learning to use the bathroom  <br/>
regularly.<br/>
<br/>
Last, but not least, and I think that Jacki articulated this so well  <br/>
in her draft response to the op, our children are not perfect, and  <br/>
their behavior is not always what others want to see.  They can be  <br/>
truly charming at times, but when they are home and in their comfort  <br/>
zone, they can also be very emotional, expressive and intense.  I  <br/>
know that there are people who witness this and think that there  <br/>
might be something wrong with it, and we need to get them under  <br/>
control.  As we have progressed in our journey, I have learned to see  <br/>
the value of not trying to shut down or &quot;fix&quot; their emotions,  <br/>
reactions and behaviors, but rather to try to understand and help  <br/>
them understand what they are experiencing, and to let them be  <br/>
genuine, not compliant and acceptable to others.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so now I&#39;ve got old friends, family and casual acquaintances  <br/>
all sending out subtle or not completely subtle messages that  <br/>
something seems a bit off about this, and I&#39;m not feeling so great  <br/>
about what they&#39;re doing that it&#39;s making me feel a little bit stiff  <br/>
in my relationships, and maybe even a little prepared to be  <br/>
defensive, which is not where I&#39;d like to be.<br/>
<br/>
It might help if we were more closely connected with our local  <br/>
homeschool community, but the get-togethers tend to be very large,  <br/>
and my daughters do not enjoy going to huge open gym activities.    <br/>
They prefer one-on-one activities, and the few friends that they have  <br/>
decided are the easiest and best to get together with are several  <br/>
schooled children, fortunately with very nice and understanding  <br/>
mothers, who live close by and can be played with more regularly.  We  <br/>
also live a little further from the bigger cluster of our homeschool  <br/>
group&#39;s families.  So the two friends are great, but we&#39;re definitely  <br/>
pursuing our own activities much of the time.  I love this, on the  <br/>
one hand, because it is great to do what we want, and I feel like we  <br/>
are connecting so much more with the kids interests, but given the  <br/>
above, I wonder if my ability to be confident with doubtful parties  <br/>
could be improved more by day to day reinforcement that unschooling  <br/>
is great.<br/>
<br/>
There are so many positives about our unschooling experience that I  <br/>
could go on and on with an equally long email (and then you&#39;d kick me  <br/>
off the list), but I think I need to get this concern out of the way  <br/>
so that I can focus on those and be confident and smooth with the  <br/>
others that might not feel that way.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts very much appreciated,<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Very many of the children who &quot;learn to read&quot; at school&#39;s pace aren&#39;t  <br/>
really reading at 8 and 12.  If they all were, why would there be any  <br/>
such thing as &quot;remedial reading&quot; or &quot;reading specialists&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
There is a gigantic industry built around pretending obvious  <br/>
realities aren&#39;t real.  There is a huge business thriving in treating  <br/>
normal children as if they&#39;re defective robots.<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/reading">http://sandradodd.com/reading</a><br/>

This was very hard for me, and I did end up extricating myself  <br/>
gradually (sometimes less gradually than other times, but that was  <br/>
always determined by the pain being inflicted on the other end) from  <br/>
families like that.<br/>
<br/>
At first it seemed to me, when my kids were little, that it was  <br/>
enough for me not to yell or hit, but it soon became apparent that I  <br/>
didn&#39;t want them to have to witness yelling or hitting either.  And  <br/>
that changed things.<br/>
<br/>
I was an older parent, and was in my 30&#39;s when kids were born, so it  <br/>
might have been easier for me than for younger moms to choose my kids  <br/>
over my same-age peers.<br/>

either me reading them aloud or listening to them on cd or tape.  My <br/>
daughter absorbed all those great stories and picked up on grammar <br/>
and vocabulary through it.<br/>
<br/>
Book for book, she had absorbed more than most kids her age that were <br/>
in school.  When she started reading on her own, (when was that a <br/>
year ago?) can&#39;t remember, anyway late for school standards because <br/>
she is 13 now, it didn&#39;t seem to matter that she hadn&#39;t been reading <br/>
all those previous years.  She was doing other more important to her <br/>
things.  She has yet to read a novel, she prefers manga, but I&#39;m <br/>
about to buy the new HP book, one for each of us and we are going to <br/>
race to the end of it.  It will be her first novel and she reads <br/>
faster than me.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t need to offer any explanation to anyone like the <br/>
lifegaurd.  It is none of their business and there are plenty of kids <br/>
in school that don&#39;t know how to read either.  Perhaps say what her <br/>
favorite book is and leave it at that and let them assume that she is <br/>
reading it on her own.<br/>

with her autistic son to give her resources that the schools weren&#39;t <br/>
giving her and the ones they were, were clearly not helping her.  She <br/>
politely took them and did nothing.  However, the last I heard she <br/>
had taken her child out of the school system to homeschool, so maybe <br/>
something I said or gave her helped after all.  I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t <br/>
have much contact with her anymore.<br/>
<br/>
I have another friend that I really enjoy, for other reasons, that is <br/>
heavily attatched to the labels too.  I just have to let it go, <br/>
because she doesn&#39;t hear what I tell her.  You can&#39;t make someone see <br/>
something they aren&#39;t ready to see or hear.  We just talk about other <br/>
things, and if the conversation comes up, I give my input.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In these situations you have to weigh the pros and cons.  Part of <br/>
getting along in the world is accepting people that are different and <br/>
still be able to acknowledge what they do have to offer.  Our kids <br/>
are no exception to this.  When my kids are visitors in someone <br/>
else&#39;s home like an aunt, they should follow house rules, wether they <br/>
like it or not.  They don&#39;t have to tolerate abuse, like yelling, but <br/>
they can address it through me if they don&#39;t feel comfortable doing <br/>
it directly to their aunt.(we don&#39;t really have aunts like this)  <br/>
<br/>
The pros are having a relationship with their cousins.  If you are <br/>
able to go with them, I would, to run interference when things get <br/>
ugly so your kids can enjoy their time.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not being required to pick up doesn&#39;t mean that you can&#39;t ask for <br/>
help picking stuff up for a visitor.  I ask my kids for help all the <br/>
time and most of the time they willingly help.  Set a timer and say <br/>
10 min pickup.  It&#39;s amazing how much can be picked up in that amount <br/>
of time.  When they don&#39;t want to help for whatever reason, I ask <br/>
that they don&#39;t get anything more out right now and give me 15 solid <br/>
uninterrupted minutes for me to do it myself.  <br/>
<br/>
Learn quick decluttering tricks so that it doesn&#39;t cause you stress <br/>
and guilt about having a house that isn&#39;t the tidiest.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, I can say that I completely understand this issue.  However, <br/>
there will be guests that aren&#39;t comfortable with the nudity.  Have <br/>
him put on a long t-shirt that covers it all up and still keeps him <br/>
free down there.  I&#39;ve just asked my daughter to put on a dress, or a <br/>
pair of undies, a robe, or sometimes a swimsuit, and sometimes she <br/>
finds her own solution of wrapping up in a blanket.<br/>

  As we have progressed in our journey, I have learned to see  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the value of not trying to shut down or &quot;fix&quot; their emotions,  <br/>
&gt; reactions and behaviors, but rather to try to understand and help  <br/>
&gt; them understand what they are experiencing, and to let them be  <br/>
&gt; genuine, not compliant and acceptable to others.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is sooo important!</div>

 </span></blockquote>It is not that they *can not* pick up their things but why do we <br/>
need to *make* them. When you are FORCED to do something you do not <br/>
like it or enjoy it or want to continue it unless you are forced. <br/>
When given the choice of how and when to pick up then it becomes <br/>
part of who you are.<br/>
<br/>
My mother hates dishes inthe sink and as soon as you eat you do <br/>
dishes. I let me dishes sit in the sink till I and ready to do them <br/>
sometimes waiting days. When I read about how *everything* is a <br/>
choice and it is all in the attitude I suddenly realized that I do <br/>
not mind doing the dishes I just do not want to HAVE to do them <br/>
right after I eat. <br/>
<br/>
I stopped making my kids pick up toys as well as chores and the <br/>
little ones will help me out if they want and then do not if they do <br/>
not I must say this also applies to my husband- I do not make him or <br/>
even (well rarely) ask him to do stuff- If he wants to help he does <br/>
and if not he does not.<br/>
<br/>
The girls 4 and 2 will start cleaning spontaneously when they are <br/>
ready- my son who is 13 will wait until dad says clean your roon and <br/>
he was raised with chores and *making* you clean up your stuff. <br/>
Recently dad is letting go of the control and son will just clean <br/>
up. <br/>
<br/>
Thisnk of something your parents made you do that you hated and do <br/>
you like it now?<br/>
