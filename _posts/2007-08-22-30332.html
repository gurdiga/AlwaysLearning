<div id="ygrps-yiv-547364649">Kirby, my firstborn, has packed up and driven away.   I&#39;m almost  <br/>
completely calm.  I have some confused butterflies in my stomach, but  <br/>
the departure was peaceful and sweet.<br/>
<br/>
I credit that to cell phones and e-mail.  Tomorrow the cable guy  <br/>
comes to hook them up for internet and cable TV.  Kirby hasn&#39;t ever  <br/>
had cable, and told the roommate he didn&#39;t really think they needed  <br/>
it, but hey...  Not many cities have a mile-high mountain right  <br/>
outside with TV transmitters on it.  And if cable is the way to get  <br/>
internet, rather than by land-line phone as we have it here, then  <br/>
he&#39;s getting cable!<br/>
<br/>
Because I could call Kirby right now, and because he can call me if  <br/>
he has so much as a flat tire, I don&#39;t need to have the fear.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not so long ago that I would&#39;ve had to wait for phone  <br/>
installation and long distance, or for a paper letter.<br/>
<br/>
Now I need to start remembering to say &quot;I have a 15 and 18 year old  <br/>
at home.&quot;<br/>

me- the joy of &quot;not&quot; wishing they would grow up and leave but stay <br/>
until they are ready to fly is such a different perspective. Thank you <br/>
for sharing <br/>

<br/>
Congratulations. You succeeded. You did your best to bring your kids up <br/>
to be confident and independent - and it worked. Damn it! Three of my <br/>
four boys have now left home to live at various distances from us and it <br/>
sure is a bitter-sweet experience. Even at this distance from you I am <br/>
feeling those confused butterflies back in my stomach once more - like a <br/>
sympathetic pregnancy!!<br/>
<br/>
But as you say, we are so lucky with modern communications - think of <br/>
the pioneers who came to early America and New Zealand - no, don&#39;t - <br/>
it&#39;s just too horrible to contemplate how their mothers felt!<br/>
<br/>
But as an unschooling mother who has a wonderful relationship with your <br/>
son, you don&#39;t have to worry about being cut out of your son&#39;s life as I <br/>
was with my eldest son. I didn&#39;t unschool him (it was a very unschool - <br/>
panic - schoolwork - unschool - panic - schoolwork pattern for him, I&#39;m <br/>
afraid) and I wasn&#39;t respectful of him as a child or teen, so of course, <br/>
he wasn&#39;t respectful of me as a consequence! We have grown back together <br/>
heaps now but it&#39;s taken a long time - he&#39;s 26 now. But my other sons, <br/>
it&#39;s so easy, so pleasant, and I am included in their lives even at a <br/>
distance.<br/>
<br/>
I still enjoy my sons, even at a distance - though I miss the physical <br/>
contact - the hugs I miss badly - but at the moment I still have one at <br/>
home and he is still there to give me hugs :-)<br/>
<br/>
So, it&#39;s not a real hug, and it&#39;s not from your son, but.................<br/>
<br/>
(((((((((((((((((((hugs)))))))))))))))))))))<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1235232221">My daughter Bronnie moved from Canberra to Sydney in June. It&#39;s a <br/>
strange sensation alright.<br/>
<br/>
But, as you say, also very different now to how it used to be. When I <br/>
left home, I virtually split from my family, except for an occasional <br/>
phone call and a rare letter when I could make the time and had the <br/>
energy. I&#39;m still in contact with Bronnie every day. <br/>
<br/>
Recently, she persuaded me to join Facebook. I do feel rather unhip <br/>
for this kind of thing, and I&#39;m also normally a very private person <br/>
so it was a little scary at first to put my personal stuff out there, <br/>
but it&#39;s turning into a most excellent adventure.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone here is on Facebook and wants to look me up (and meet &#39;the <br/>
man behind the mask&#39;), please do.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Sandra, for all the enlightenment and your words of wisdom. I <br/>
hope everything goes wonderfully well for you in the next phase.<br/>

I read this post early this morning and it has just stayed with me and  <br/>
tugged at my heart.   Every time you&#39;ve posted about Kirby&#39;s upcoming  move, I&#39;ve <br/>
taken notice because I realize we&#39;re quickly approaching those days  here.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve been reminded of my own journey from New Mexico to Austin.  I was  in my <br/>
later twenties when I packed up a U-Haul and can still  remember the <br/>
excitement as I started out on that trip.  I had no idea that  it was difficult for my <br/>
mom but I certainly can appreciate it now.  I was  there for 16 years but I <br/>
made that 14 hour drive back to Albuquerque several  times a year to see my <br/>
family and it always felt like I was going home. I  imagine that Kirby will also <br/>
know that road  well...&lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
It seems good that Kirby&#39;s move has been anticipated and planned for  so <br/>
thoughtfully. I hope I can be as calm as you have seemed when my  children are <br/>
ready to make their move away from home.<br/>

Thanks, Cally.<br/>
And thanks for the nice thoughts, all of you.<br/>

Kirby called a while ago, 20 minutes from Austin.  They&#39;re going to  <br/>
stay in a motel tonight and get the apartment tomorrow, take the  <br/>
trailer back, and Eric-the-roommate&#39;s dad is staying until Monday.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby said from 2:00 to 8:00 or so he was out of phone range and they  <br/>
couldn&#39;t call between cars either.  He said he saw a whole lot of  <br/>
goats and cattle.  But he&#39;s well and happy, and I got to talk to him!!!<br/>
<br/>
Last Thursday Kirby and I were in old-town of Sacramento, the 19th  <br/>
century section, and went on a tour with Pam Sorooshian, Roxana, Roya  <br/>
and their friend Howard.  The in-character guide reminded us that  <br/>
letters from California to the St. Louis used to go by boat from San  <br/>
Francisco around South America and up the Mississippi.<br/>
<br/>
No cellphones.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-220842064">Tell him that as soon as he has internet, he might want to sign in on<br/>
Craigslist in Austin to look for any items he might have forgotten or not<br/>
taken space to bring.   Lots of action this time of year (and an amazing<br/>
number of &quot;free&quot; items) and if he has a phone and a car...................<br/>
<br/>
Also,  the last weeks of August and first part of  September are the very<br/>
best times for viewing the Congress Ave bats as they emerge each evening.<br/>
Millions of them!<br/>

<br/>
Roya is in Alaska and has been there since the end of May. I talked  <br/>
to her three times today. Once she called to see if I&#39;d remembered to  <br/>
turn in a request for a copy of her college transcripts. Later she  <br/>
called because she was having a problem with Microsoft Word (she was  <br/>
at a ranger station, using their computer to type up a report for her  <br/>
job as an assistant back-country forest ranger). And she called  <br/>
another time just to chat about her plans for coming back here and  <br/>
getting a job and renting a house with her boyfriend when the summer  <br/>
job is over. Sometimes a week or so has gone by without us talking,  <br/>
but that&#39;s mostly because she&#39;s really out in the wilderness much of  <br/>
the time, with no cell phone reception, no electricity, no running  <br/>
water, etc.<br/>
<br/>
It is a mostly very nice phase of life, becoming adult-to-adult  <br/>
friends with our kids. The transition time is sometimes a little  <br/>
awkward, though.<br/>
