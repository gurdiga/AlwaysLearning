<div id="ygrps-yiv-156517237">I&#39;m a bit confused...it sounds like your daughter wants to learn to read and<br/>
I&#39;m wondering what&#39;s stopping her.  What&#39;s stopping her doing a reading<br/>
scheme or playing on a website like www.starfall.com ?  It doesn&#39;t matter if<br/>
it seems schooly if it&#39;s what she wants, does it?  If she wants to learn to<br/>
read, then she&#39;ll probably do it fairly quickly with the right support?  Or<br/>
have I misunderstood your message?<br/>
<br/>
My DD1 wanted to learn to read (she&#39;s 5 now) so we got her, with her help,<br/>
early reader books, which she ploughed through very quickly.  She hated<br/>
reading scheme books as they&#39;re so boring, but she loved the starfall<br/>
website, and also a UK website which you may be able to get access to from<br/>
the US - education city.  She wasn&#39;t interested in phonics, but has learnt<br/>
quickly and easily the &#39;whole words&#39; way.  She had no confidence at first<br/>
(we think she was comparing herself to us (her parents) only as she&#39;s the<br/>
oldest) so we decided together to do a reading age test as I knew she knew<br/>
more than she thought she did and she came out 2 years older than she<br/>
actually is, which gave her the confidence to really go for it.  I don&#39;t<br/>
consider this to be not unschooling because it was all on her terms - we<br/>
just supported her and provided her with whatever she needed, sometimes<br/>
suggesting things she may not have been aware of, and sometimes getting her<br/>
stuff she&#39;d seen that she asked for.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-258833205">Here is something someone else wrote on another list and my response.  <br/>
I wrote something else about the benefits of later reading, but can&#39;t  <br/>
find it right now. I&#39;ll keep looking.<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; One result of this is that even though my degrees are in literature<br/>
 &gt; and creative writing, I have really tried to give both my kids space<br/>
 &gt; to develop oral skills before they get swept up into print. I<br/>
 &gt; actually think it&#39;s more important to talk to children constantly and<br/>
 &gt; tell stories than to read to them! Reading, as far as I can tell,<br/>
 &gt; will take care of itself, since reading skills can be learned at any<br/>
 &gt; time with no loss of ability (as far as I know, a person who learns<br/>
 &gt; to read at 50 can read just as well as someone who learns to read at<br/>
 &gt; 5 - there are no benefits mentally speaking to learning to read<br/>
 &gt; sooner rather than later, no developmental &quot;window&quot; during which<br/>
 &gt; reading can more easily be learned).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I love the way you put it. This is<br/>
why later reading is very very cool. Kids who read later (who aren&#39;t<br/>
shamed and aren&#39;t feeling pressured TO read), are more immersed in a<br/>
hearing, listening, oral world and it shows. The kids I know who read<br/>
later are amazingly good at grasping and remembering stuff they hear!<br/>
<br/>
One kid I know, who began to read at 12 or 13 years old, took one of<br/>
my college econ classes at 17 years old. He sat in class, never took<br/>
notes, remembered EVERY single thing from my lectures and aced all the<br/>
tests. Remarkable!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1367385403">*When my daughter was about 8, she mentioned wanting to go to school a few<br/>
times.<br/>
After talking to her, I found out she thought she wouldn&#39;t learn to read<br/>

without school, that some of her schooled-friends didn&#39;t know how to read<br/>
yet.<br/>
<br/>
She decided she wanted reading &quot;lessons&quot;.  We played school sometimes.<br/>
I also found the book &quot;Teach your child to read in 100 easy lessons&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is one thing I did too when Sophia was asking about reading.  <br/>
The <br/>
directions were something we ignored and she basically just sat <br/>
beside <br/>
me on the couch and read the bolded words over and over.  I made a <br/>
list <br/>
of the words as she read them and printed it out. &quot;You know how to <br/>
read <br/>
these words&quot; made her feel confident enough that we only got a third <br/>
of <br/>
the way through the book.  She just seemed to need a boost.<br/>
<br/>
I also played word family games with her. I also made some word <br/>
family <br/>
cards where she could put consonants in front of &quot;at&quot; and &quot;in&quot; and <br/>
such <br/>
in order to make words. <br/>
<br/>
At the same time as this was happening, she was reading words on Zoo <br/>
Tycoon and <br/>
Spyro.  Then she started reading the subtitles on DVDs.  Then she <br/>
went <br/>
on to read chapter books. <br/>
<br/>
It took &quot;longer&quot; than I expected. with my expecations based on my <br/>
faulty thinking about reading. Each year, I&#39;d think, &quot;Ok. She can <br/>
recognize these words. She&#39;ll be reading within a few months.&quot; Then a <br/>
few months would go by and I&#39;d say, &quot;ok, so NOW she&#39;ll start <br/>
reading.&quot; I thought that she&#39;d go from sight <br/>
memorization right to reading chapter books and comprehending all of <br/>
it <br/>
on an equal level.  My school-influenced idea of reading and what was <br/>
actually occuring were vastly different. It happened in stages, <br/>
stages she was able to <br/>
control and manage herself, in her own time and comfort level.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1747420994">I think the main point is that the child learns when they want to, whether<br/>
that&#39;s early or late.  I have to say I don&#39;t like the thought that children<br/>
who have a passion for books could be held back from learning to read<br/>
because someone&#39;s read somewhere that later readers have this, that or the<br/>
other benefit.  Early readers have a lot of benefits too - like being able<br/>
to spend years and years reading amazing stories.  It&#39;s the pressure that&#39;s<br/>
wrong, not the age IMO.  My oldest two are very, very different children.<br/>
One learnt her alphabet at 2.5y and is now a nearly fluent reader at 5 with<br/>
no &#39;teaching&#39; or anything - just lots and lots of books being read to her,<br/>
as requested, and the odd game on the computer etc. as requested.  My second<br/>
only knows the first letter of her name at age 3.5.  She loves books,<br/>
though, and always wants to be read to.  But she&#39;s far more &#39;creative&#39; (can<br/>
never remember which side of the brain it is!) than her older sister and<br/>
will spend literally hours on a painting or something similar.  There is<br/>
need in society for people who are more immersed int he hearing, listening,<br/>
oral world *and* people who are more immersed in the details of literacy and<br/>
numeracy and the important thing is letting each child develop their own<br/>
interests, in their own time without pressure or undue influence to either<br/>
do things later or earlier.<br/>

<br/>
Everyone ASSUMES that early readers are advantaged. There&#39;s no need to  <br/>
defend that. One of my daughters read fluently at 3 years old and was  <br/>
reading pretty much anything and everything by 5 years old. She was  <br/>
tested by the school and maxed out their test at the 11th grade level.  <br/>
Not a single person ever doubted that she was benefitting from all the  <br/>
reading she did when she was still very young. And now she&#39;s a college  <br/>
student and considering a major in either linguistics, comparative  <br/>
literature, or theater.<br/>
<br/>
But, when kids read later, people assume they are missing out on  <br/>
something. They don&#39;t consider that there are benefits to later  <br/>
reading because kids who aren&#39;t reading aren&#39;t vegetating - they are  <br/>
learning.<br/>

<br/>
No one is recommending holding anyone back from learning to read.<br/>
<br/>
No one can make anyone learn to read.  You can press them to  <br/>
phonetically sound out each work, which can hamper fluent reading.   <br/>
You can try to teach them to learn to read before they&#39;re ready so  <br/>
that they hate words, books and you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday Joyce Fetteroll and her daughter Kathryn and I went to the  <br/>
Unser Racing Museum (not sure the exact name of it), a nice new  <br/>
museum in Albuquerque.<br/>
<br/>
There were two men there in their thirties, VERY interested in the  <br/>
place, knowledgeable, and sometimes one would read aloud to the other  <br/>
from one of the display boards, enthusiastically but haltingly, very  <br/>
phonetically until he would recognize the name of a race track or a  <br/>
race.   That&#39;s not the kind of reading Kathryn Fetteroll was doing.   <br/>
She could silently scan the words and take meaning.  She didn&#39;t need  <br/>
to sound words out.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have no doubt that those nice men are halting readers because  <br/>
school told them very early on that they weren&#39;t reading, that they  <br/>
weren&#39;t readers.  They believed that the school knew how to teach  <br/>
reading, and they believed the school that they just were somehow not  <br/>
bright enough to do it.<br/>

in his reading and just take off.  It&#39;s been slow and steady all <br/>
along.  He didn&#39;t have the slightest interest in reading at age 8.  He <br/>
is now almost 12 and can mostly read.  It&#39;s still slow and he has <br/>
trouble with some words, but he can figure a lot out on his own now.  <br/>
He mostly reads for gaming.  My dd Jamie is 9 and reads almost as well <br/>
as Jack.  But, she&#39;s played around with letters and spelling since she <br/>
was 4 or 5.  She started reading a Junie B. Jones chapter book by <br/>
herself this summer and needs help with bigger words, but impressed me <br/>
with how much she can read.  She seems to be doing the &quot;take off&quot; thing.<br/>
Jack has an amazing memory and attention to detail.  We listen to books <br/>
on tape in the car a lot, and what he grasps and remembers really <br/>
facintates me.  I&#39;m not like him at all that way.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1574940629">This past summer my son J  descided he should learn to read.  His <br/>
brother is 5 and can read quite well cause he just can and I think <br/>
that intimidated J a little bit.  After exploring the whole thing a <br/>
little with him though I learned several things.. he wanted nothing to <br/>
do with &quot;baby books&quot;  or books written specifically for beginning <br/>
readers.  He wanted nothing to do with repetive practice like <br/>
worksheets or 100 easy lessons or anything like that but I did go with <br/>
him to the store and we bought several books that he thought looked <br/>
good like Captain Underpants and some of other Dav Pilkey books and we <br/>
read them together.  Mostly I read but sometimes he would want to read <br/>
a little.  Now we are back to my mostly reading but he feels better <br/>
about being on his way to learning to read.  I think he can see his <br/>
own progress in that directions and so he feels better about it <br/>
again.  He has asked me before if he would learn more if he was in <br/>
school.  I think other kids say things like that because schooled kids <br/>
are repeatedly told that in order to learn and not grow up to be a bum <br/>
they have to go to school.</div>

Sandra, you say &#39;there&#39;s not much you can do but...&#39; but what you&#39;ve<br/>
mentioned is a lot and would be a lot of help to parents whose children want<br/>
to learn to read but are unsure how to support them.  We&#39;ve never sat down<br/>
with our 5yo and said &#39;right, let&#39;s do some learning to read&#39;, partly<br/>
because I don&#39;t believe in doing things that way, but partly because she<br/>
puts the brakes on the minute we overstep the mark in this respect!<br/>
However, when she said she wanted to learn to read, we just said &#39;well keep<br/>
on doing what you&#39;re doing, because you are learning - you can see you&#39;re<br/>
learning because of all the words you recognise&#39;.  What she was doing, off<br/>
her own back, was looking at books on her own, or with her sister (a *lot*<br/>
of time spent on this - often I&#39;d hear that silence that usually makes you<br/>
go &#39;ok...what on earth are they up to now?  Is my bathroom going to be<br/>
flooded or something awful like that?&#39;, I&#39;d tentatively go upstairs and find<br/>
them both sitting in bed looking at books!  For an hour or so!), doing<br/>
workbooks for five or ten minutes at a time - they love them but DD1 is like<br/>
a butterfly and apart from spending time looking at books, doesn&#39;t stick at<br/>
anything else for very long!, playing on the computer, talking about words,<br/>
singing songs, etc - all the things you mention.  Rather than making<br/>
&#39;learning to read&#39; a thing in itself, instead it&#39;s been very much the way<br/>
she learned to talk - an absorption of the skills needed, in her own time<br/>
and in her own way and on her own terms.<br/>

No, I understand that.  I think I feel a bit of pressure sometimes coming<br/>
from fellow HEors (in the UK, not on this list) who follow Steiner methods<br/>
because DD1 is very young to learn to read autonomously and, being parent<br/>
who is passionate about autonomy in childhood, often feel the need to<br/>
impress on these people that I didn&#39;t teach her to read and she wasn&#39;t<br/>
hothoused - she just doesn&#39;t fit the Steiner ideal of children being<br/>
creative for the first 7 years of their lives - it&#39;s not who she is.<br/>

<br/>
Late readers can spend years and years listening to amazing stories -  <br/>
they don&#39;t miss out on that &quot;benefit&quot; by reading later. Some of the  <br/>
most &quot;well-read&quot; young adults I know were much later readers.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest benefit of early reading is that it makes schooling  <br/>
easier. But we&#39;re not schooling, so that isn&#39;t a benefit in our  <br/>
families.<br/>
<br/>
I almost never read books - I listen to audible books on my ipod nano.  <br/>
I had to learn to listen - there was most definitely a learning curve.  <br/>
But now I much prefer to listen and I choose my listening material  <br/>
based at least partially on the narrator&#39;s ratings.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What&#39;s helpful to understand when faced with helping a child learn what they aren&#39;t ready to learn is that while a parent can support a child&#39;s <br/>
desire, they probably can&#39;t speed development along.<br/>
<br/>
And I say probably because we can&#39;t really know. We *can* be certain teaching to read doesn&#39;t work, otherwise the schools wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
having problems. Whether reading to them, playing word games and so on speeds development a little (because the child&#39;s making <br/>
connections) is impossible to say. It doesn&#39;t influence development in a large way, otherwise there wouldn&#39;t be unschooling kids in print rich <br/>
atmospheres who don&#39;t read until their teens.<br/>
<br/>
A child may desire to ride a bike, but unless they&#39;re developmentally ready for the coordination and everything else needed, they can&#39;t. Does <br/>
riding a bike with training wheels help them be ready sooner? Once they&#39;re developmentally ready, will having ridden with training wheels <br/>
for a year or two get them upright quicker? Maybe. Who knows. But I&#39;m betting there isn&#39;t a huge difference.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I do have an anecdote. When Kat was 3 or 4, Carl held a Tae Kwon Do class for little kids. Just a fun thing. Nothing rigorous. Kat did the <br/>
classes for a year but she wasn&#39;t all that coordinated. She&#39;d go through the motions of punching and kicking but she looked awkward. (Other <br/>
kids her age were more coordinated, though not all.) It wasn&#39;t until several years later, without further lessons, that she was playfully <br/>
kicking and it actually looked coordinated and like a Tae Kwon Do kick. <br/>
<br/>
So, kids can pick up knowledge without being able to use it. But imposing that knowledge against the child&#39;s desire -- as schools do with <br/>
trying to make them learn to read -- can be a good way to turn them off of something. What good would learning to punch as a 3 yo do if <br/>
Kat had hated the process? Will she find Tae Kwon Do easier if she takes it up again? I don&#39;t know, but the ease wouldn&#39;t be worth the <br/>
struggle of imposing it on her (since it would also run the risk of turning her off).<br/>
<br/>
So, do things because they&#39;re fun, not because you think it will lead somewhere. Expose them to lots of stuff. Keep doing the stuff they <br/>
enjoy. Drop the stuff they don&#39;t. (It&#39;s so obvious, written out that way ;-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Joyce has already responded really well, but I want to add that I&#39;m  <br/>
not here so much to help parents as I am to help children.<br/>
<br/>
If your child wants to learn to read, assure her that she will.  Then  <br/>
keep the world happy and peaceful and instead of arranging your  <br/>
expectations in schoolish terms (&quot;she will learn to read by the time  <br/>
she&#39;s seven,&quot; or &quot;he will learn multiplication first and then  <br/>
division&quot;), find ways to think of it natural learning terms (&quot;she  <br/>
will pick this up naturally as time goes by, just from being in a  <br/>
stimulating, peaceful environment&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
It seems at the moment you&#39;re focusing on what  you to think about  <br/>
what I can do to help a lot of parents support their children who  <br/>
want to learn to read.<br/>
<br/>
What I would like to focus on is how children learn to read in their  <br/>
own ways, easily, when they&#39;re ready and able, if and when people  <br/>
stop trying to teach them.<br/>
<br/>
People learn many very difficult things naturally.  Perhaps we don&#39;t  <br/>
see them as &quot;difficult&quot; when we KNOW for sure they are learned  <br/>
naturally.  Walking.  Understanding speech.  Speaking.  Jumping.   <br/>
Climbing.  Singing.<br/>
<br/>
If we lead children to believe that reading must be &quot;taught&quot; (even by  <br/>
using phrases such as &quot;she taught herself&quot;), they will think other  <br/>
things have to be &quot;taught&quot; too.   But if a child learns to read on  <br/>
his own, he will *know* that he can learn other things on his own.<br/>

Apologies!  However, I personally *love* getting engrossed in a book and<br/>
can&#39;t switch off enough to sleep if I don&#39;t read beforehand.  I also enjoy<br/>
sharing books.  For anyone who does enjoy reading books to themselves, it&#39;s<br/>
a benefit to do it young...and I would assume that those who do learn to<br/>
read young are likely to be people who are going to enjoy reading books to<br/>
themselves.  It&#39;s a lovely way to be by yourself, but not lonely or bored.<br/>
I can quite understand that not everyone loves it, but for those that do,<br/>
then how many more years of that joy you&#39;ll get if you are an early reader?!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The biggest benefit of early reading is that it makes schooling<br/>
easier. But we&#39;re not schooling, so that isn&#39;t a benefit in our<br/>
families.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is certainly why schooled children need to read young, but only if they<br/>
go to conventional schools.  It&#39;s not the biggest benefit, though, for<br/>
children who don&#39;t go to school - it&#39;s an irrelevant benefit!<br/>

I agree...if a parent is new (or not!) to unschooling, surely it&#39;s helpful<br/>
to the child to say to the parent &#39;keep their environment word-rich and<br/>
they&#39;ll learn when they&#39;re ready to&#39;.  It&#39;s scary being a parent and nice to<br/>
know that you&#39;re not denying the opportunities a child needs to learn when<br/>
they want/are ready to about anything.  If you&#39;re child wans&#39;t learning to<br/>
read because you had no books in your house and no computer - no access to<br/>
words - that&#39;s holding them back.  Ensuring they have the opportunity to<br/>
access what they need, and knowing what that might be, if and when they need<br/>
it is a good thing...isn&#39;t it?  And letting parents know what that might be,<br/>
and reassuring them that children *will* learn unless you ban anything with<br/>
words on is also a good thing...isn&#39;t it?  Children will automatically<br/>
benefit from parents who feel they&#39;re doing the right thing (or at least not<br/>
doing the wrong thing) and who have relaxed about their concerns about the<br/>
child not learning to read by a certain age?<br/>

Whether someone loves reading for pleasure or not, it doesn&#39;t matter<br/>

more pleasure. That just doesn&#39;t hold true in an unschooling family.<br/>

read because you had no books in your house and no computer - no access to<br/>
words - that&#39;s holding them back.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t holding them back if you live in a world without computers or books. In that world reading is a luxury good that may not help you to gain the skills you need to live life. Lots of people have had lives without reading. Lots of history is about people without books or computers. Now, this lifetime, there are parts of the world without books or computers. David (dh) interviewed Mayans in Belize who didn&#39;t have much schooling, and were illiterate, but knew what they needed to for getting the most money that they could for the produce that they grew and sold.  Lots of people, including those living in the U.S. or the UK or wherever, don&#39;t need to read to get the things that they want out of life. The interesting thing to David was that the people he met in Belize where perfectly capable of reading what they needed to read when they needed to read it, no matter what their age at first reading was. And none of the people he interviewed had reading<br/>
 material beyond the textbooks that their children used for school and for some, maybe, a bible. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not being as clear as I would like. My feeling is that if you live in a community without books and computers, for whatever reason, accessing those things is a way to get yourself excluded from that community. Or, at least, for the reading to be really useful, really applicable to your life, you would have to leave that community and find another. Not that I live in such a world. But many people do, not by choice, but by necessity. <br/>
<br/>
Simon, my 11 year old son, is not reading yet. He has books and computers that fill our house and his life. I read to him, although not a lot these days, there just aren&#39;t books he wants to hear. He gets books on cd, I think being able to control when they start and stop is much more satisfying than having me read. For a long time I worried, very occasionally I still worry, but I know, and, more importantly, he knows, that reading will happen when it happens. Until then, I&#39;m not waiting or moaning, more than that I am utterly impressed with the things that he sees based on not reading. He listens so much more intently than I do, I&#39;ve read all of the Harry Potter books, he&#39;s listened to them, and he knows them better. If I&#39;d listened to them I&#39;d have to learn how, as Pam said she needed to do, I&#39;d have to figure out how to stop my mind chattering so much so that I could hear Stephen Fry or Jim Dale reading to me. I would remember far less than he does. He<br/>
 does that a lot, hears or sees a cue that I didn&#39;t see or hear. I did that when we lived in Japan and were completely illiterate. David would get the staff at the university to write out some of the Kanji that we needed to recognize for the bus to get home and the rest we had to figure out on our own. I still can&#39;t read or speak Japanese, but we had a full and wonderful life that year. <br/>
<br/>
Also, I don&#39;t read a lot these days. I used to read almost all the time. I would have many books on the go and would forgo many other things to read them. When I had Simon and Linnaea being present was more important than reading and my reading began to wane. Reading, it seems, was about filling the empty spaces, and when I had children I had fewer of those. My reading is beginning to rise again. I am reading a bit more now than I did last year, but my life is still more interesting than other people&#39;s literary view of life. I&#39;m not dismissing reading, but I do think that it is less valuable than it is often considered. Linnaea, my daughter, read at 6. She likes being able to read. But she doesn&#39;t read many books. Mostly it is about comics on the toilet, or quests on WoW. For books, she likes to snuggle up in bed at night and have me read to her. And Simon doesn&#39;t have any sense of less than by not reading as early as she did. <br/>

This was true for Chamille too.  Even with games that required some sort<br/>
of memory skill, like Clue, where you had to write it down on paper to<br/>
keep track of it, she&#39;d just remember it all in her head.  She couldn&#39;t<br/>
read, or write out the words.  She ALWAYS won.  She was so good at<br/>
keeping it all straight in her head.  Meanwhile everyone else is keeping<br/>
track on paper and their head, but refering back to paper to keep it all<br/>
straight.<br/>
<br/>
She remembers all those details.  I think, in part, because she doesn&#39;t<br/>
have her mind filled with things that are irrelevant to her.  She can<br/>
operate at her best capacity!  She reads a lot now, book after vampire<br/>
book.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-510973371">For anyone who does enjoy reading books to themselves, it&#39;s<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; a benefit to do it young...and I would assume that those who do learn<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; read young are likely to be people who are going to enjoy reading<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; then how many more years of that joy you&#39;ll get if you are an early<br/>
 </span></blockquote>reader?!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that assumption connects with what actually happens.  I<br/>
think liking to do things by yourself is more of a personality trait<br/>
than anything to do with reading.  My older daughter, now 14 started<br/>
reading at 11/12 ish.  She reads all the time now.  I don&#39;t think she<br/>
missed out on years of joy though, she was doing things that she really<br/>
liked that were far more important and interesting than reading was at<br/>
the time.<br/>
<br/>
She loves stories, really good stories.  You can get stories from many<br/>
many sources, like movies and other media.  Her main source for stories<br/>
came from her own head.  She most definitely wasn&#39;t missing out on<br/>
interesting stories and itricate plots, because she was living them and<br/>
acting them out in her play, she wasn&#39;t passively reading them.</div>

&gt; about the<br/>
&gt; child not learning to read by a certain age?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know about children automatically benefitting from parents  <br/>
simply thinking they are doing the right thing. First, we (regular  <br/>
posters on this list) are not here telling people to &quot;do the right  <br/>
thing.&quot; We are here saying that you don&#39;t have to &quot;do school&quot; - that  <br/>
kids can learn without curriculum, lesson plans, tests, grades,  <br/>
assignments, or being taught in any usual sense of the word - and that  <br/>
the same principles that apply to learning conventional school  <br/>
subjects apply to other kinds of learning, too.<br/>
<br/>
But, there are plenty of parents who think they&#39;re &quot;doing the right  <br/>
thing&quot; when they smack their kids around, when they shame them, and  <br/>
all sorts of things. We&#39;re most definitely not here to help parents  <br/>
think they are doing the right (or wrong) thing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling rests on a foundational set of beliefs about how children  <br/>
learn. I say, &quot;beliefs,&quot; because most people don&#39;t believe in them. It  <br/>
started out more as a matter more of faith - it was based on an  <br/>
underlying view of human nature. But, there is now a considerable  <br/>
amount of evidence based on modern brain research to support these  <br/>
beliefs. We don&#39;t spend a lot of time looking at that research, but it  <br/>
is out there and pretty much completely ignored by education  <br/>
professionals. These days, though, many of us have grown unschooled  <br/>
children who provide evidence enough to give us tremendous confidence  <br/>
in unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re here to consider and examine and analyze unschooling principles  <br/>
and to look at how they may be applied in a wide variety of real  <br/>
situations and circumstances. We know that the result of this kind of  <br/>
analytical process can be that parents come to more and more deeply  <br/>
understand and embrace unschooling in ways they hadn&#39;t previously. We  <br/>
know that parents often become kinder and gentler with their children  <br/>
as their thinking about how children learn changes. It isn&#39;t about  <br/>
right or wrong. It isn&#39;t about parents feeling better or worse. It is  <br/>
about deepening our understanding of the basic principles and how they  <br/>
work.<br/>

<br/>
Parenting in a reaction to fear isn&#39;t a good place to begin.  Fear based<br/>
parenting can lead to a lot of unnecessary thought hindering the process<br/>
of natural learning.  If a parent is fearing that a child may not learn<br/>
to read, a child will pick up on that.  It&#39;s not going to help the<br/>
natural process of reading, and worse may hinder it.  Fear puts blocks<br/>
to learning.  The optimal learning environment is happy and relaxed.<br/>
<br/>
If you know that your child will read eventually, you can relax and then<br/>
your kids can relax.  If your focus is on being happy and having fun,<br/>
how can a child go wrong with that?  If the mind is open and happy and<br/>
relaxed all kinds of learning goes on!<br/>
<br/>
We know a few kids personally that are completely hindered by fear.  The<br/>
parents don&#39;t see it and the kids don&#39;t see it, it has become so natural<br/>
for them to feel it and have it in their lives that they can&#39;t see it<br/>
for what it is.  There is a lot of fear in our culture, I won&#39;t go into<br/>
that too much.  I guess it&#39;s a choice to focus on a different part of<br/>
life, the part of life that is happy and natural and fun, so that when<br/>
there is real fear and real things that are unhappy, we can get through<br/>
them without it ruining us.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;m not making sense... I guess I feel pretty strongly that life<br/>
is in a large part what you make it to be.  Anyone can make it fearful<br/>
and hard, but it makes life more fulfilling to make it fun and happy.</div>
