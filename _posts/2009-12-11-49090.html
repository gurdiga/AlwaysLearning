<div id="ygrps-yiv-1967738191">My 8 year old son has been starting to read. I have seen him reading signs, some things on video games etc.. Early on, before hearing about unschooling, I did try to teach him to read, he was about 5, he hated it, and after about a month I backed off.  Since then I havnt totally quit worrying about it or left him alone about it but I have tried to.  He has always been a little self conscious about reading because he realized at some point that his younger brother had started reading and can now read most things.  We have had several conversations about how different people learn to read and other things at different times and in their own time.  He still feels a little bad about his brother.  He says he hates to read.  and that he has no reason to learn to read since he cant play Roblox on the computer (it bluescreens whenever they try to).  So I said, &quot;well learning to read takes practice and once you learn to read you wont hate to anymore&quot;.<br/>
And then I started thinking about the trueness of that statement.  Of course I can predict whether he will till hate it.. but does it really take practice.   If so how much or how little.<br/>
My middle son, who reads, has since he was 5.  He is almost 7 now and can read most things.  He doesnt read books, never read 20 minutes a day, he reads well but never really practiced reading over and over.  With my 8 year old, he went from really not having any idea what different words were, to knowing some and reading some words that I know he hasnt read before.<br/>
So does it really take practice, or is it more a developmental readiness paired with exposure to it?</div>

My daughter was caught in the in between stage of wanting to read  <br/>
better but it still being hard so she didn&#39;t read enough to progress  <br/>
as fast as she wanted. Then she found an adult book series she loved  <br/>
and that&#39;s when she took off reading.<br/>

If you were trying to perfect a souffle and declared in frustration  <br/>
you didn&#39;t even like souffles to your husband, if he said words to  <br/>
the effect of &quot;Well, it will get better&quot; it would probably sound like  <br/>
he wasn&#39;t even listening to your frustration, just trying to keep you  <br/>
moving toward a goal he agreed was important.<br/>
<br/>
It might help to picture him talking about something you didn&#39;t have  <br/>
a person stake in and only cared whether he was enjoying himself or  <br/>
not, like skateboarding or doing backflips on a trampoline.<br/>

I don&#39;t think it takes practice.  I think it takes figuring out, and  <br/>
those other things you said.  &quot;developmental readiness paired with  <br/>

And if there are things he can do that the sibling can&#39;t, maybe  <br/>
mention those gently too.<br/>
<br/>
When Holly was frustrated that she couldn&#39;t read, I would point out  <br/>
(softly) things she could do that one or both of her brothers learned  <br/>
at a later age, or things she could do that friends her age couldn&#39;t  <br/>
do, or cool things she had done that I hadn&#39;t done at her age.  Not to  <br/>
set up competitions, but to focus on differences in people&#39;s  <br/>
opportunities and abilities and development.<br/>

Do you mean the computer crashes when he tries to get in to a game?<br/>
Have you tried to  fix it or contacted Roblox for help? They are pretty nice there and maybe be able to help.<br/>
 Can you help your son figure that out?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The problems we are having with our computer has been a great source of frustration for the kids (especially my oldest) and we have been trying to work it out. It has been going on for several months and the kids have had alot of difficulty with it but right now we cant get a new one.  However, at Christmas we are taking the computer to my sister who thinks she can get it running well enough to play the kids games. Also, my mom has a computer she nolonger uses and although I doubt it has enough memory to run the games, i think it will be fine for me to do the few things I do online so I can give our computer over to the kids. So hopefully they wont be missing ROBLOX to much longer.</div>

When I only had one computer I tried to do all my stuff when my son was sleeping or otherwise busy so he could use it to play. He was very nice if I needed it when he was using it as he understood sometimes I had to get to it to do somthing farm related.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You misunderstand. <br/>
The kids can play on the computer, it just cant support ROBLOX and other games which require alot of memory.  I think there is also something wrong with our video card.  I do need the computer sometimes but my use of it doesnt take away from their use and it isnt the reason the games dont work.<br/>
