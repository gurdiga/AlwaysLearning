<div id="ygrps-yiv-697759807">Hi, I&#39;m Leslie, from Flower Mound, TX, north of Dallas/Ft. Worth.   Can&#39;t <br/>
remember if I&#39;ve already sent an intro, so if I have, hi again.  I&#39;m  unschooling <br/>
mom of three daughters, Katelyn, 21, Jackie, 19, and Cassandra,  14.  <br/>
 <br/>
Karen - Katelyn unschooled herself from age 15 and was accepted in college  <br/>
at 17.  We lived in Colorado, which has all sorts of rules about curriculum  <br/>
and standardized testing, so we enrolled in an awesome umbrella school in Grand  <br/>
Junction.  (We lived in Denver, a couple hundred miles away.)  It&#39;s  called <br/>
West River Academy, and it&#39;s run by Peggy Nishikawa. Email:    <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:_WRAcademy@...">_WRAcademy@...</a>_ (mailto:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:WRAcademy@...">WRAcademy@...</a>) .  Peggy is  fantastic, and has all sorts of <br/>
knowledge to share.  I don&#39;t know if  she enrolls out-of-state residents, but <br/>
you could ask her.  If not, I&#39;m  sure she&#39;d know something about what&#39;s <br/>
available in your area.   <br/>
 <br/>
We have a local support group based in Flower Mound (just north of DFW  <br/>
Airport):  DFWSaFE Zone (Dallas/Ft. Worth School-Free Education  Zone).  Any <br/>
unschooling or very relaxed eclectic types in this area are  welcome to check us out <br/>
at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:_DFWSaFE@yahoogroups.com">_DFWSaFE@yahoogroups.com</a>_ (mailto:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:DFWSaFE@yahoogroups.com">DFWSaFE@yahoogroups.com</a>) . <br/>
 <br/>
Good luck!<br/>
 <br/>
Leslie <br/>
