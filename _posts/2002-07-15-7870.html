<div id="ygrps-yiv-273877337">Thank you, Sandra, for the link to your article about your sister&#39;s family.<br/>
It&#39;s Mary here who has had a child now ask for school. She has been home,<br/>
unschooled her almost 8 years. She&#39;s going in for an insiders veiw she says.<br/>
And added, I&#39;m going to school for fun, everyone else has to go. <br/>
<br/>
This fall will be unique. Ashley will start 3rd grade at the end of August. My<br/>
2 other little ones will be here home. I suspect our days will be spent riding<br/>
Ashley to school, playing at home, the park, and visiting local places like<br/>
the firestation, then picking Ashley up. It&#39;s like stepping back 2 years when<br/>
my oldest was 5. Time will move slower for us at home and I look forward to<br/>
that. Ashley keeps teasing me that I do not want her to go to school, which I<br/>
answer back,&quot;I want you to go to satisfy your need to go, I just don&#39;t want<br/>
you to stay there very long&quot;. She has said now she thinks she will go to<br/>
school for at least 2-3 years. I&#39;m hoping for a few months, yet again, this is<br/>
her choice, she&#39;s making it and I&#39;m, gulp, supporting it.<br/>
<br/>

We all got fishing poles and are practicing our casts. Next year maybe will<br/>
put hooks on them and try fishing for real.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Rain has talked about going to school on and off. I think being at<br/>
theater workshop by 9 every morning in Woodland may have ended that. She<br/>
loves theater workshop, but even that&#39;s not worth waking up so early some<br/>
days. And school would mean waking up an hour earlier...<br/>

of the backwater sections at the state park, just put a #10 baitholder<br/>
hook with a small nightcrawler at the bottom and a bobber a couple of<br/>
feet up, and you don&#39;t have to cast very far.... it&#39;s a great lazy summer<br/>
afternoon thing to do.<br/>

I guess Yahoo is still delivering mail spottily.  Once in a while lately I <br/>
see a response to something I didn&#39;t get too.   <br/>
