<div id="ygrps-yiv-72762388">Hello Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve only had a little bit of online time, and have been jumping <br/>
around quite a bit lately.  But I&#39;m finding some very interesting <br/>
thoughts expressed here, but can&#39;t seem to find the &#39;beginning&#39; of <br/>
the discussions I&#39;m interested in reading.  They&#39;re kinda &#39;scattered&#39; <br/>
under different thread headings, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Some would call me an &#39;ostrich&#39; because I am SO VERY UN-POLITICAL, <br/>
and don&#39;t follow the political news at all anymore.  Mainly because <br/>
I&#39;m disgusted with it all....<br/>
<br/>
But these discussions about the pledge of allegiance, political <br/>
affiliations, etc. are really stirring interest in me to get re-<br/>
involved at least long enough to know what this is all about.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve deleted a lot of emails that probably would have answered all my <br/>
questions, but you know how it is when your mailbox gets crammed up <br/>
and you start getting warnings, I just start deleting the &#39;less&#39; <br/>
important ones just by looking at the subject lines.  Now, I&#39;m afraid <br/>
I&#39;ve missed some very important stuff.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Today is &#39;first day of school&#39; here in Oregon, and Steven wanted to <br/>
have &#39;our&#39; &#39;first day&#39; today, so we&#39;re going to begin today, at his <br/>
request....<br/>
<br/>
All that aside, as I was reading some &#39;parts&#39; of discussions on this <br/>
list, I started getting a little antsy about getting to the bottom of <br/>
it all....<br/>
<br/>
Steven&#39;s grandpa is a retired professor, a WWII vet (and he&#39;s a <br/>
walking encyclopedia, too), and he is definately the most patriotic <br/>
oriented person I&#39;ve ever met....<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve learned NOT to even begin political discussions with him, <br/>
because while we disagree with most of his political stands, we <br/>
respect him enourmously as our elder, but I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW, <br/>
that he&#39;s going to try to teach Steven the pledge of allegiance, (he <br/>
loves to &#39;drill&#39; him on &#39;what he knows&#39;....which I do everything to <br/>
avoid such a situation) and I need to be prepared for that <br/>
eventuality.<br/>
<br/>
Apparently there are some things I&#39;m not familiar with regarding the <br/>
pledge.  I would be MOST GRATEFUL for any enlightenment here.  If <br/>
there are any articles online, or any feedback from y&#39;all, that would <br/>
be great!  I&#39;ve tried peicing together bits and peices of the <br/>
discussions here, but so far, haven&#39;t made heads nor tails about <br/>
the &#39;meat&#39; of the matter.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks muchly,<br/>
Faye</div>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you go to google.com and put in <br/>
pledge allegiance history<br/>
<br/>
you&#39;ll get all kinds of articles.  They were just flying around when the <br/>
federal lawsuit about it being unconstitutional came up a few months back.  <br/>
<br/>
This list isn&#39;t intended to be the be all and end all of anything, it&#39;s just <br/>
an unschooling list.   Information is flowing like a river all around us.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I googled it and found pages of information on the pledge. I think I put in <br/>
the words; Pledge, Allegiance, Origin, I omitted any conjunction words and <br/>
got a much better return than I did when I put in; The Origins of the Pledge <br/>
of Allegiance. (or something like that. &lt;G&gt;) Lots of pro and anti pledge, and <br/>
many good informative sites. <br/>
