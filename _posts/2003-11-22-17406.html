<br/>
<br/>
  The US standard railroad gauge (distance between the rails) is 4 feet,<br/>
8.5 inches. That&#39;s an exceedingly odd number.<br/>
<br/>
  Why was that gauge used?<br/>
<br/>
  Because that&#39;s the way they built them in England, and English<br/>
expatriates built the US Railroads.<br/>
<br/>
  Why did the English build them like that?<br/>
<br/>
  Because the first rail lines were built by the same people who built<br/>
the pre-railroad tramways, and that&#39;s the gauge they used.<br/>
<br/>
  Why did &quot;they&quot; use that gauge then?<br/>
<br/>
  Because the people who built the tramways used the same jigs and tools<br/>
that they used for building wagons, which used that wheel spacing!<br/>
<br/>
  Okay! Why did the wagons have that particular odd wheel spacing?<br/>
<br/>
  Well, if they tried to use any other spacing, the wagon wheels would<br/>
break on some of the old, long distance roads in England, because that&#39;s<br/>
the spacing of the wheel ruts.<br/>
<br/>
  So who built those old rutted roads?<br/>
<br/>
  Imperial Rome built the first long distance roads in Europe (and<br/>
England) for their legions. The roads have been used ever since.<br/>
<br/>
  And the ruts in the roads?<br/>
<br/>
  Roman war chariots formed the initial ruts, which everyone else had to<br/>
match for fear of destroying their wagon wheels. Since the chariots were<br/>
made for Imperial Rome, they were all alike in the matter of wheel<br/>
spacing.<br/>
<br/>
  The United States standard railroad gauge of 4 feet, 8.5 inches is<br/>
derived from the original specifications for an Imperial Roman war<br/>
chariot. And may the bureaucracies live forever.<br/>
<br/>
  So the next time you are handed a spec and told we have always done it<br/>
that way and wonder what horse&#39;s ass came up with that, you may be<br/>
exactly right, because the Imperial Roman war chariots were made just<br/>
wide enough to accommodate the back ends of two war horses.<br/>
<br/>
  Now the twist to the story...<br/>
<br/>
  When you see a Space Shuttle sitting on its launch pad, there are two<br/>
big booster rockets attached to the sides of the main fuel tank. These<br/>
are solid rocket boosters, or SRBs. The SRBs are made by Thiokol at<br/>
their factory in Utah. The engineers who designed the SRBs would have<br/>
preferred to make them a bit fatter, but the SRBs had to be shipped by<br/>
train from the factory to the launch site. The railroad line from the<br/>
factory happens to run through a tunnel in the mountains. The SRBs had<br/>
to fit through that tunnel. The tunnel is slightly wider than the<br/>
railroad track, and the railroad track, as you now know, is about as<br/>
wide as two horses&#39; behinds.<br/>
<br/>
  So, a major Space Shuttle design feature of what is arguably the<br/>
world&#39;s most advanced transportation system was determined over two<br/>
thousand years ago by the width of a Horse&#39;s Ass.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  And you thought being a Horse&#39;s Ass was not important??<br/>
