Holly  said recently that she didn&#39;t mind if we shared socks. There <br/>
are some of  mine too big for her and some of hers too small for me, <br/>
but there&#39;s an  overlapping set of socks we snag as needed<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

 <br/>
The nightstand beside my bed is our family sock drawer.  Brenna, Logan  and I <br/>
all wear the same size...all white lowcut sport socks.  Broc&#39;s are  twice the <br/>
size of the rest.  The socks just get thrown into the drawer and  when anyone <br/>
needs a pair they rummage through and find a pair that may or may  not match. <br/>
 I like mine to match.  <br/>
 <br/>
Every few months, Logan will sort the socks because it&#39;s something he likes  <br/>
to do and we get rid of all the ones that no longer have matches   (where do <br/>
they go??? &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
 <br/>
Right now, they are all matched up which I find is a sign of our typical  <br/>
summers ...Not so many places we need to get to so we have time for doing a  few <br/>
more jigsaw puzzles and organizing our sock drawer.<br/>

I have a basket of singles.  Sometimes a sock emerges from a longtime  <br/>
hidey-hole (sometimes one is up in the corner of a fitted sheet that  <br/>
was folded and put in the closet, or behind the washing machine, or  <br/>
up under someone&#39;s bed) and we can find its mate. Sometimes I use  <br/>
those for dust-mitts or for wiping something really greasy and then  <br/>
just throwing them away (ceiling fan in the kitchen--409 spray and  <br/>
socks on my hands), or maybe washing them and putting them back in  <br/>
the single socks basket.<br/>

We&#39;ve found colored sharpies, here. Sometimes we put an initial on a toe,  <br/>

everyone could have their own color. I even went so far, once, as to number all  my <br/>
pairs ( a left and right #1, a left and right #2, etc.) so that I would have  <br/>
matching socks with the same amount of wear and discoloration on them. That  <br/>
proved to be too much, so we just mark them for owners, now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1548334320">We&#39;ve just tie dyed  most of our socks.  If you want a matched set, you can look hard and find one that sorta matches, or if you are lucky the one that really does match.  Other than that, they all look good.  I get a lot of positive comments on my tie dyed socks.  So do the girls.<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;I too keep a &quot;sock basket&quot; on the dryer for any loners. I  have had a <br/>
mate show up years later! Where DO they  go?!&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve kept a basket, and currently a bag of them. I use the holey ones for  <br/>
dusting and cleaning (over my hand, like Sandra mentioned). There&#39;s a  <br/>
*wonderful* story about where lost socks go (and buttons and other such things)  in a <br/>
collective book of cat stories by different authors called Cat Fantastic,  <br/>
Andre Norton being one of the authors on the cover. (ISBN-13: 9780886773557) They <br/>
now have sequels (2 up to at least 5)  that I haven&#39;t read, but that one is <br/>
super and I re-read it often. Ah! That  particular story is by Donna Farley and <br/>
is called &quot;It must be someplace&quot;.  (Funny, when I asked Wyl if he knew where <br/>
the book was he said, &quot;Oh, you mean  the one with the story about the lost <br/>
socks?!&quot; LOL)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1155478577">I am lol-ing at all these sock posts!  What a joy to get a glimpse<br/>
into the lives of my fellow list mates.  I can just see the sock<br/>
baskets by the dryers, the Sharpie marked socks, the tie-dyed socks,<br/>
the hundreds of superfluous socks...<br/>
<br/>
I was so inspired I bought everyone (including me) a great big new<br/>
package of socks today. <br/>
<br/>
I will keep this thread in mind the next time I discover the socks<br/>
under the couch right AFTER I finished all the laundry.  Life&#39;s too<br/>
short to stress about socks.  Or even underwear. <br/>
