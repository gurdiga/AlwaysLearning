<br/>
I was at a workshop featuring John Holt long ago, when the issue of being <br/>
questioned came up.  John explained that he didn&#39;t mind answering questions <br/>
that were asked when the person truly wanted the information.  He gave the <br/>
example of being stopped while walking on the street, and someone is lost, <br/>
and wanting instructions.  He said when someone truly wants to know more <br/>
about un/homeschooling he didn&#39;t mind answering their questions no matter how <br/>
often he has offered that particular information.  BUT, when they are asking <br/>
questions to try to put it down, or make fun of what you are doing, he simply <br/>
wouldn&#39;t answer the questions.  He called those &quot;hippopotamus questions&quot;.  <br/>
That has helped me clarify when I do and don&#39;t respond  to be questioned <br/>
(even when it&#39;s my Mother asking those questions!  Or, maybe especially when <br/>
it&#39;s my Mother!).<br/>
