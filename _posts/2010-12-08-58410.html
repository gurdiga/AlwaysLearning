<div id="ygrps-yiv-1414315898">Sparked by a love for the BBC documentary Victorian Farm, I have been<br/>
doing some reading on Project Gutenburg from books that were popular at<br/>
the time.  I found a book called Advice to Mother by Pye Henry Chavasse.<br/>
(Chavasse was an Obstetrician in the late 1800s.  )  I was so shocked to<br/>
read that it was common advice in the Victorian period to acknowledge<br/>
that even then, it was perfectly reasonable for children to only prefer<br/>
certain foods and that forcing children to eat is &quot;a sin and a shame&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
This is very timely for me as I am anticipating a holiday gathering<br/>
where certain older eyes in our family go to the plates of our sons<br/>
watching for empty dishes.  Our sons have yet to please their<br/>
grandparents in this department and I don&#39;t choose a holiday gathering<br/>
as a time to really get into an argument.  At least now I have a little<br/>
inner peace knowing that even in eras gone past, not eating  everything <br/>
and not cleaning your plate was not a big deal.  It can be easy to think<br/>
that the opinions and beliefs of older family members represent &quot;How it<br/>
has Always Been&quot;.  Not so, at least, not always.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a bit from this old book....<br/>
<br/>
163. My child has an antipathy to certain articles of diet: what would<br/>
you advise to be done?<br/>
<br/>
A child&#39;s antipathy to certain articles of diet should be respected: it<br/>
is a sin and a shame to force him to eat what he has a great dislike to:<br/>
a child, for instance, sometimes dislikes the fat of meat, underdone<br/>
meat, the skin off boiled milk and off rice-pudding. Why should he not<br/>
have his likes and dislikes as well as &quot;children of a larger growth?&quot;<br/>
Besides, there is an idiosyncrasya peculiarity of the constitution<br/>
in some childrenand Nature oftentimes especially points out what is<br/>
good and what is bad for them individually, and we are not to fly in the<br/>
face of Nature. &quot;What is one man&#39;s meat is another man&#39;s poison.&quot; If a<br/>
child be forced to eat what he dislikes, it will most likely not only<br/>
make him sick, but will disorder his stomach and bowels; food, if it is<br/>
really to do him good, must be eaten by him with a relish, and not with<br/>
disgust and aversion. Some mothers, who are strict disciplinarians,<br/>
pride themselves on compelling their children to eat whatever they<br/>
choose to give them! Such children are to be pitied!<br/>

I really liked the quote, and I&#39;m glad you brought it, but I&#39;m not sure one man&#39;s writing equals &quot;common advice.&quot;  He might have been a solitary weirdo (like John Holt) who was commonly ignored.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s possible.  <br/>
<br/>
I think (and I could be wrong) that Americans are the worst of all about trying to force children to do things they don&#39;t like or want, with the whole &quot;If it tastes bad, it must be good for you&quot; stuff.  Maybe it&#39;s more universal.  I sure hope not.<br/>
