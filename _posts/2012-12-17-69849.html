A joyful attitude is your best duck. <br/>

A different approach to life yields a very different set of ducks. <br/>

It might not have been about unschooling, until the unschooling quotes came out.   But as a stress reducer and good practice playing (in case you&#39;re one of those stodgy types) and perhaps for something to share with your kids (you can play it at home; it doesn&#39;t need to be on my facebook page), it&#39;s a good thing.<br/>
