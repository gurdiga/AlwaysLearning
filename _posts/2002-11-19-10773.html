I Don&#39;t Know Why I Like Him<br/>
A filk by Gail Bohacek to the tune of I Don&#39;t Know How To Love Him from<br/>
Andrew Lloyd Webber&#39;s Jesus Christ Superstar<br/>
<br/>
The confessions of a hopeless Snape fan<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know why I like him<br/>
What he does, how he does it<br/>
It&#39;s really strange, must be deranged<br/>
&#39;Cause I read his scenes in all the books<br/>
Over and over again<br/>
<br/>
So dark and yet mysterious<br/>
I don&#39;t know, he intrigues me<br/>
I&#39;m a fan of this Snape man<br/>
But there are others in Rowling&#39;s books<br/>
Who I should like much more<br/>
Him, I adore<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s not being fair when he screams and shouts<br/>
Bullying Neville. <br/>
Chewing Harry out<br/>
Taking away House points - what&#39;s it all about?<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s rather funny<br/>
I&#39;m not the only one here<br/>
Who thinks Snape is really cool<br/>
How he dealt with Black, back at the Shack<br/>
Stealing every scene<br/>
But he&#39;s so mean<br/>
<br/>
I never thought I&#39;d like this Snape - what&#39;s it all about?<br/>
<br/>
Yet, if knew him in real life<br/>
I&#39;d avoid him, I&#39;d be frightened<br/>
Won&#39;t tolerate the way he hates<br/>
I&#39;d be grossed out by his greasy hair<br/>
His bad teeth and large nose<br/>
I just don&#39;t know<br/>
That&#39;s how it goes<br/>
I like him, though</div>
