<div id="ygrps-yiv-982459724">So, Rain and I are leaving California on Wednesday, journeying with 2<br/>
dogs, 2 cats, and a very full trailer to Kansas City. We&#39;ll probably be<br/>
taking 80 most of the trip, unless anyone has any better ideas. It seems<br/>
that we&#39;ll have to go through the Rockies and the Sierras no matter what<br/>
we do, unless we take 5 south and 40 across, and since we live near Sac<br/>
that&#39;s a long way out of the way. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll be going through Nevada, Utah, Wyoming and Nebraska.... does anyone<br/>
know of any any trip tips? Nice motels or campgrounds on the way?<br/>
Shouldn&#39;t-be-missed attractions? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Arches, in Utah<br/>
Worth a quick run-around.<br/>
Take food and water with you before you get there (water especially) in  case <br/>
you like it and want to stay longer.<br/>
 <br/>
Buy gasoline early and often, because there are stretches of highway out  <br/>
there that are lo-o-o-ong.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-653943808">Oh, that sounds so cool. I&#39;ve always wanted to visit Wyoming, and I would<br/>
love to do a dig!<br/>
<br/>
Alas, both Thermopolis and the Arches in Utah would add at least a couple<br/>
of hundred miles to our trip, which is a lot when you&#39;re going 55 the<br/>
whole way. Any ideas for cool things not far from I-80? Anything to do in<br/>
Cheyenne?<br/>
<br/>
We will definitely have to do the drive again, sans trailer, and do more<br/>
meandering...<br/>

<br/>
No KIDDING!  You&#39;re MOVING to KC?<br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s only 300 miles from me!  I was just there.  <br/>
 <br/>
If you&#39;re coming 80 all the way to Lincoln, NE, you really should stop at  <br/>
Arbor Day Farm in Nebraska City, NE (Just off I-29 in the southeast corner of  <br/>
the state--It&#39;s 50 miles from Lincoln and on your way to KC).  If you are  <br/>
interested in trees and the environment at all, it is a wonderful place, very  <br/>
informative.  Check out the Dragon&#39;s Lair (Fuelwood Plant) at the Lied  Lodge in <br/>
the farm.  There are places there I didn&#39;t get to go because  they weren&#39;t <br/>
open for the season, yet.  Morton Mansion is one, where  J. Sterling Morton lived <br/>
when he founded Arbor Day.  I do plan on making  another trip up there this <br/>
summer.<br/>
 <br/>
Did you know the founder of Arbor Day, J. Sterline Morton, is the father of  <br/>
the man who founded Morton Salt?<br/>
 <br/>
There were a LOT of connections to be made at that place.<br/>
 <br/>
I am so excited someone cool will be in KC!<br/>

It&#39;s more like THREE hours.  ;)<br/>
 <br/>
But I said that because I do plan on exploring KC now that I&#39;ve been there  <br/>
once, and it would be cool to have someone cool THERE to hang out with.<br/>
 <br/>
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, JULIE!  I would love to go out with you  guys. <br/>
