<div id="ygrps-yiv-1587484744">Julian left Sunday morning for a field experience in Marine Biology in way <br/>
Northern Maine (almost to Canada). We&#39;re outside of Boston.<br/>
<br/>
I have some time on my hands, so, in theory, I&#39;m trying to get some work <br/>
done, and do some stuff in the house. So far I&#39;ve mostly played online and <br/>
played The Sims. Beth and I REALLY missed the dibbun last night. <br/>
<br/>
Julian&#39;s dad has had a revelation, though. After many months of mostly <br/>
playing computer games (and complicating the lives of those around him, but <br/>
that&#39;s another story), and years of insisting that HE&#39;S not the one <br/>
homeschooling  (except for panics and demands for more structured work on the <br/>
part of Julian), Perry has realized that Learning is Interesting and Fun! We <br/>
had a marvelous conversation about art, politics, life, etc. He wanted to <br/>
share all this with Julian, and was very open when I suggested that he share <br/>
them as things he&#39;s interested in, rather than trying to &quot;teach&quot; Julian. <br/>
<br/>
If this takes, Julian will be a very happy Junior Marine Biologist.<br/>
<br/>
Kathryn, who with Beth, is VERY jealous of Julian&#39;s week, and also misses him <br/>
very much<br/>
