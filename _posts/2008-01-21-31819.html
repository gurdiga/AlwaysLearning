<div id="ygrps-yiv-123572662">Hi,<br/>
I&#39;ll admit straight off that I don&#39;t home school. I am a UK working<br/>
mum of a 20 month old girl. I have several friends who do homeschool<br/>
and I admire the commitment it takes. <br/>
I plan to send Naomi to school at the normal age but want to help her<br/>
to see learning as fun and continue learning through all her<br/>
activities. I see the point that if you HAVE to do something you might<br/>
stop WANTING to.<br/>
At present Naomi is with a very good local childminder 3 days a week.<br/>
I am home with her the other days and find being a mum to an active,<br/>
inquisitive child, harder than a day at work!<br/>
I am interested in your opinions and suggestions for what I can do now<br/>
with her as a pre-school child; and how to keep her interest in home<br/>
based learning once she is also attending school (almost 3 years off).<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Rachel</div>

asked how they could incorporate that poison into their lives and  <br/>
what can they do about minimizing the poison that will happen?<br/>
<br/>
While poison is a strong word for school, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a  <br/>
child who has been to school without at least some damage. Having to  <br/>
go to school, buying into the concept that what is presented there is  <br/>
more important than the way you&#39;d prefer to spend your time, that  <br/>
mommy has more important things to do each day than spend time with  <br/>
you which is why the child needs sent off.<br/>
<br/>
That last sounds *really* harsh, but no matter how much a parent  <br/>
wants the child to believe the child&#39;s needs are important, when  <br/>
we&#39;re putting the child&#39;s needs behind something else (work,  <br/>
shopping, cooking) our actions are saying the total opposite. So the  <br/>
child can&#39;t help but internalize the message that they aren&#39;t as  <br/>
important as work.<br/>
<br/>
Are there ways to minimize the effects of school? I think my  <br/>
daughter&#39;s friends parents have done a great job of staying connected  <br/>
with their schooled daughter and encouraging her interests. (The mom  <br/>
would have been a great unschooler.) They spend a lot of hours doing  <br/>
things together as a family, supporting her. But I *still* see the  <br/>
damage school has done to her. She thinks she&#39;s fat. She acts as if  <br/>
her parents are jerks when she&#39;s around her friends. She stresses  <br/>
over school work. School eats up huge hours of her day, not just in  <br/>
the classroom but homework and for what? Kids either have to buy into  <br/>
the idea that all that work is important or otherwise they&#39;re wasting  <br/>
a huge chunk of their life. Some kids *don&#39;t* buy into it and see the  <br/>
bogusness of school and they&#39;re miserable.<br/>
<br/>
Being trapped in any situation is just not healthy for happiness. You  <br/>
either have to buy the lie or be miserable with the truth.<br/>

Joyce said some very important things.<br/>
<br/>
As to &quot;combining the best of both&quot; you can&#39;t have any unschooling if  <br/>
your child is in school.<br/>
<br/>
You CAN have an interesting life, now and then and when your children  <br/>
are grown and gone, if you keep yourself interested and curious and  <br/>
joyful.  If you banish cynicism and resentments and live with  <br/>
acceptance and happiness that will help in any case.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Also attending school&quot; takes you outside of the realm of   <br/>
unschooling, though, and we can only really help if you want to  <br/>
unschool.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something that might be of some help at some point, but let it  <br/>
live in the shadow of what Joyce wrote.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1856442142">I would like to thank Sandra for the helpful comment / resources.<br/>
I think for me it will be important to hold myself back from pushing<br/>
her to succeed in school. I see that it can become extremely<br/>
unhelpful. It is also far to common for parents to DO the homework, so<br/>
that the kids get better marks.<br/>
Personally, I found &quot;spoon fed&quot;, teacher based learning an easier<br/>
option than the experience led &quot;Continuing Professional Development&quot;<br/>
which I am expected to document throughout my career as a pharmacist.<br/>
I have made the choice to return to work now, as my professional<br/>
qualification requires me to keep up to date.<br/>
I am very satisfied with the childcare arrangements I have presently;<br/>
however proper school does appear to be when you lose control of how a<br/>
child speaks and thinks - in many cases.<br/>
I also realise that I have taken the topic outside the scope of this<br/>
group since I<br/>
am not committed to unschooling. I will wait a week or so to receive<br/>
directly relevant replies and then I think I will unsubscribe myself,<br/>
a little wiser.<br/>
Thanks for bearing with me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-816984257">Alfie Kohn wrote an article for Ed-Week that addresses this idea. From the <br/>
article:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Like other people, educators often hold theories about how the world works, <br/>
or how one ought to act, that are never named, never checked for accuracy, <br/>
never even consciously recognized. One of the most popular of these theories is a <br/>
very appealing blend of pragmatism and relativism that might be called &quot;the <br/>
more, the merrier.&quot; People subscribing to this view tend to dismiss arguments <br/>
that a given educational practice is bad news and ought to be replaced by <br/>
another. &quot;Why not do both?&quot; they ask. &quot;No reason to throw anything out of your <br/>
toolbox. Use everything that works.&quot;<br/>
But what if something that works to accomplish one goal ends up impeding <br/>
another? And what if two very different strategies are inversely related, such <br/>
that they work at cross purposes? As it happens, converging evidence from <br/>
different educational arenas tends to support exactly these concerns. Particularly <br/>
when practices that might be called, for lack of better labels, progressive and <br/>
traditional are used at the same time, the latter often has the effect of <br/>
undermining the former.&quot;<br/>

a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; child speaks and thinks - in many cases. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Pulling an idea out of this post for general notice:<br/>
<br/>
Having control over how our children speak or think, especially think, is <br/>
probably not an great Unschooling goal. Expanding their options, offering <br/>
them more than the narrow interpretation of &quot;right thinking&quot; that school <br/>
culture might give, helping them explore how many people speak and think - <br/>
that seems more in line with Unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I think I know what Rachel means - that school and the people there can <br/>
become the biggest influence and source of information.<br/>
<br/>
However I certainly don&#39;t see myself as able to control always unschooled <br/>
Jayn&#39;s (at 8 at least) speech or thoughts at all, even while I occasionally <br/>
coach her to speak in more pleasant ways or suggest she forgo some verbal <br/>
expressions in some situations.<br/>
But control her thinking? Limit her thinking to mirror mine? Impossible - <br/>
and not an impossible dream either - more like a nightmare. I don&#39;t want to <br/>
control her thinking. I don&#39;t think I ever had that control.<br/>
<br/>
As an aside trying to control her behavior is never a happy moment either.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll be here if you change your mind, Rachel. So will Sandra&#39;s pages, <br/>
Joyce&#39;s pages, numerous books and blogs. I recommend www.naturalchild.org <br/>
since your child is still young.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1556761292">I would very much encourage reading the first chapter of the book mentioned below, Teenage Liberation Handbook. This will explain my concern whether what you hope for is possible (and I am generally a very optimistic person).  I can&#39;t comment on Australian schools, but you perhaps should read John Taylor Gatto&#39;s book about the REAL (historically documented) purpose of modern American schools.  I have to wonder if  Australian schools would be that different inpurpose but I can&#39;t actually say. Since you have asked such an excellent question I hope you&#39;ll fnd the answers you seek.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1704977030">OK - the subject has changed slightly I suppose. It has become almost<br/>
&quot;why I will send my child to school.&quot; Bear with me as I think we are<br/>
having a meaningful discussion.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that adult (degree level) education, in Britain, is now<br/>
turning increasingly in the direction of what they call, &quot;problem<br/>
based learning.&quot; It seems to me that it would be easier for a person<br/>
used to the unschooling methods, than for me, with my extremely<br/>
curriculum based education.<br/>
I was pushed to work at school and I don&#39;t know what I would have<br/>
acheived if left to my own devices. I can understand the argument that<br/>
it is because of my schooling that I fear missing opportunities and<br/>
don&#39;t always trust myself to find the &quot;right&quot; answer. The fact remains<br/>
that I want Naomi to be employable; and would prefer her to have an<br/>
income well above the minimum wage level. I don&#39;t have confidence that<br/>
I could enable her to get the required professional qualifications<br/>
with no school involvement.<br/>
The point is academic really as I intend to continue working and can&#39;t<br/>
therefore take on this responsibility full time. (Thank you for all<br/>
remaining polite. I know to some of you I must appear selfish.)<br/>
I wondered how many of you had been unschooled yourselves? I read a<br/>
comment about how the daughter of one member felt cheated and planned<br/>
to send her child to preschool etc.<br/>
It occurred to me that we are all influenced very much by our own<br/>
backgrounds: e.g. I was given the education my parents felt they had<br/>
been denied. My dad was born in 1921 so the school leaving age was 14.<br/>
He succeeded in earning a degree later in life but felt he had to do<br/>
it the hard way.</div>

Interesting time and place to use the word &quot;academic.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Are decisions about our children and our parenting &quot;academic&quot;?  Did  <br/>
college tell you how to be a parent?<br/>
<br/>
-=-It occurred to me that we are all influenced very much by our own  <br/>
backgrounds:...-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It occurred&quot; suggests you haven&#39;t been living with that constant  <br/>
awareness for your entire life.  The might be part of why you&#39;re  <br/>
having a hard time thinking clearly about your daughter&#39;s life.  She  <br/>
has already been influenced by her own background.  Not &quot;very much,&quot;  <br/>
but ENTIRELY.   She will be influenced by what happens to her while  <br/>
you&#39;re reading this, and after you stand up from the computer.  There  <br/>
are no do-overs with raising a child.  That child grows up and is  <br/>
influenced all the way through.<br/>

<br/>
So your parents lived vicariously through you, to some extent maybe?   <br/>
That can&#39;t help but happen to some extent, but it&#39;s good to know when  <br/>
it&#39;s happening and feel ourselves being aware of when we&#39;re accepting  <br/>
our children&#39;s growth and when we&#39;re trying to build new-improved  <br/>
Mini-Me&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve been given good suggestions about enriching your daughter&#39;s  <br/>
life while she&#39;s in school, and that&#39;s the best you can get from this  <br/>
list.  If you don&#39;t want to think about why you&#39;re making the choices  <br/>
you&#39;re making, run away!  This list WILL make you think, and you can  <br/>
only escape by escaping.<br/>
<br/>
Once I was asked (with hostility) &quot;Are  you willing to risk your  <br/>
child&#39;s future on your &#39;theories&#39;?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I said &quot;Yes, aren&#39;t you?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If your theory  is that school equals much money and therefor  <br/>
happiness, you&#39;re going to take that risk, that school won&#39;t  hurt a  <br/>
bit and will guarantee &quot;success.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Someone said once, when I was talking about the purpose of groups  <br/>
such as these, &quot;You can&#39;t make me think.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure she&#39;s been thinking of that ever since. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1168529299">Hi there--<br/>
I want to encourage you to keep listening in to the conversations here<br/>
and other groups (maybe Unschooling Basics and Always Unschooled, for<br/>
example) and just keep listening. Since your daughter&#39;s so young, it&#39;s<br/>
a great time to learn about it. There are always interesting topics to<br/>
listen in on.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I wouldn&#39;t say that unschooling is a way for anyone to &quot;keep<br/>
their child interested in learning&quot; though. Every single kid is<br/>
already interested in life and learning and all that. Unschooling<br/>
helps me to respect and love my child for who he is and not define his<br/>
experience to him (or to me). i.e. &quot;this is learning and valuable, but<br/>
this over here--this is a waste of time&quot; If I&#39;m not assigning a value<br/>
or morality on some activity, he keeps moving forward in his own life<br/>
with me and his dad supporting him. It&#39;s an awesome life.<br/>
<br/>
I work at a local grocery store and we have regular customers who come<br/>
in and I sort of get to know them in the many 2 minute conversations<br/>
we have during the week. This one guy comes in, he&#39;s bummed out one<br/>
day and I ask him about it. He says, &quot;Oh, it&#39;s my niece. She&#39;s 22 and<br/>
just not interested in anything. Doesn&#39;t work, lays around the house<br/>
all day. Dropped out of school (college). Sheesh. I don&#39;t know what to<br/>
do for her.&quot; So I ask, &quot;Well, what&#39;s she interested in?&quot; And he says<br/>
cringing, &quot;She wants to go to beauty school.&quot; And I look at him like,<br/>
&quot;Duh! Help her do that, dude.&quot;, but I smile and say, &quot;That&#39;s great!<br/>
She could go to cosmetology school! There&#39;s all sorts of things she<br/>
could do with that.&quot; He scoffs, &quot;That&#39;s not a real job!&quot; <br/>
*sigh* An example of what not to do, perhaps. Adults take that<br/>
attitude all the time with kids of all ages. That will destroy the<br/>
love of learning in anyone for sure.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1529967344">My husband works at the University of East Anglia where they use Problem Based Learning within the med-school (don&#39;t know about the other departments). PBL seems to be the new vogue teaching technique. Don&#39;t know if it works better, but it works much the same. He has to make sure that the students achieve the right points, it the right learning notes if you will. It is a curriculum, it is just under a different guise. Anyhow, I don&#39;t know if unschooling makes one more or less prepared for PBL or not. What unschooling does is help someone be better able to feel that learning happens whatever, and maybe, just maybe, formal education might be a good way to go to learn more about what you are interested in. <br/>
<br/>
As a side note University education in the U.S. is nothing, really only a little bit, like University education in the UK. David says it is like some combined honours programs, but not really. As an American formally educated within the U.S. and only looking over the shoulder of my husband as he works within the U.K. higher education system, I prefer the U.S. system by a long way. <br/>
<br/>
There will always be missed opportunities. We left Albuquerque for the UK just before the newest unschooling group there really got going. If we&#39;d stayed, man, well, we didn&#39;t... Just because you missed an opportunity doesn&#39;t mean that you aren&#39;t going to have other opportunities come along, or that you aren&#39;t going to be capable of making new opportunities for yourself. I think that is where unschooling really shines, it lets an individual, a child, know themselves better than they would know themselves if they were told what to do and when to do it and how to think. I think that if you know yourself and your abilities and ways to negotiate through your limititations, you will make enough opportunities for yourself that the missed ones won&#39;t effect you so much.<br/>

Subject: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Combining the best of both? Can it be done?<br/>
<br/>
OK - the subject has changed slightly I suppose. It has become almost<br/>
&quot;why I will send my child to school.&quot; Bear with me as I think we are<br/>
having a meaningful discussion.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that adult (degree level) education, in Britain, is now<br/>
turning increasingly in the direction of what they call, &quot;problem<br/>
based learning.&quot; It seems to me that it would be easier for a person<br/>
used to the unschooling methods, than for me, with my extremely<br/>
curriculum based education.<br/>
I was pushed to work at school and I don&#39;t know what I would have<br/>
acheived if left to my own devices. I can understand the argument that<br/>
it is because of my schooling that I fear missing opportunities and<br/>
don&#39;t always trust myself to find the &quot;right&quot; answer. The fact remains<br/>
that I want Naomi to be employable; and would prefer her to have an<br/>
income well above the minimum wage level. I don&#39;t have confidence that<br/>
I could enable her to get the required professional qualifications<br/>
with no school involvement.<br/>
The point is academic really as I intend to continue working and can&#39;t<br/>
therefore take on this responsibility full time. (Thank you for all<br/>
remaining polite. I know to some of you I must appear selfish.)<br/>
I wondered how many of you had been unschooled yourselves? I read a<br/>
comment about how the daughter of one member felt cheated and planned<br/>
to send her child to preschool etc.<br/>
It occurred to me that we are all influenced very much by our own<br/>
backgrounds: e.g. I was given the education my parents felt they had<br/>
been denied. My dad was born in 1921 so the school leaving age was 14.<br/>
He succeeded in earning a degree later in life but felt he had to do<br/>
it the hard way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-307042284">Hi, Rachel<br/>
<br/>
I have a 22 year old daughter who was conventionally schooled <br/>
(including three years at a private all-girls school in London), who <br/>
graduated from high school here in Australia in the top 1% of <br/>
students in her state and who is currently prepping for the final <br/>
exams next month of both the Law degree and the degree in Forensic <br/>
Science that she&#39;s been studying concurrently. She already has a BA <br/>
that she completed two years ago. Since August, she&#39;s been in <br/>
training as a Scene of Crime Officer, a career job with a starting <br/>
salary that&#39;s almost twice the national average income.<br/>
<br/>
I also have a 12 year old son who went to school for two years, hated <br/>
it and asked to be taken out. He has now been out of school for more <br/>
than five years and in all his time at home with me has mostly <br/>
played videogames, watched TV and surfed the internet. We have <br/>
conversations every day about a wide range of &#39;real world&#39; subjects. <br/>
What I hear from my son the most is &quot;I know that already&quot;. And he <br/>
does know it. Without being taught.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s up to me, my son will never see the inside of a school <br/>
classroom again.<br/>
<br/>
Two reasons. <br/>
<br/>
With the advent of the internet and the Digital Revolution generally, <br/>
institutional classroom based education is being rapidly superseded <br/>
by more efficient methods of education that are readily available to <br/>
anybody and everybody who wants to take advantage of them. Including <br/>
children. In this day and age, and especially since 2005 when the <br/>
internet blossomed into full on multi-media, if you&#39;re connected to <br/>
Google and you can&#39;t educate yourself, you&#39;d have to want to not be <br/>
educated. Schools generally, in the face of this reality, are <br/>
becoming less and less about education and more and more about <br/>
covering their asses by continually lowering standards in order to <br/>
keep their &#39;academic numbers&#39; looking good and about keeping teachers <br/>
in jobs. I feel sorry for the poor sods - i.e. the students who <br/>
attend these glorified child minding centres - who are expected to <br/>
carry the can. I was reading an article about the supposed &#39;school of <br/>
the future&#39; the other day and there was a picture of children seated <br/>
at rows of desks each with an open laptop in front of them. Who are <br/>
these people kidding? Not me. When I went to school in the 1950s, <br/>
there was no doubt that it was most parents&#39; best option if they <br/>
wanted their children to get a &#39;good education&#39; and if there was crap <br/>
that went with that, and there was, you were expected to accommodate <br/>
it as best you could - and that was in the days when most children <br/>
had at least one parent at home all day, but how many of them would <br/>
be willing to attempt something virtually everybody knew a school <br/>
teacher could do better? Now those days are gone and they&#39;re not <br/>
coming back. And outdated and no longer useful beliefs are going with <br/>
them. By the time my son has a child of &#39;school age&#39; (if he does), <br/>
the idea of sending him or her to an institution to sit in a <br/>
classroom and be taught by somebody with no more capability than he <br/>
has (and if many schools&#39; resistence to digital tachnology is <br/>
anything to go by, far less capability) will be like, &quot;What are you? <br/>
Amish or something?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Second reason. The view from where I&#39;m standing tells me there&#39;s big <br/>
money to be made in online education. &quot;Webucation&quot; as management guru <br/>
Peter Drucker calls it. The real education revolution is going on <br/>
behind the backs of the &#39;keepers of the school system&#39; as more and <br/>
more companies come into the distance and online learning market. <br/>
And, since many of these companies are already experienced providers <br/>
of educational resources and services to *adults*, they know that <br/>
educational efficiency is the name of the game. No fluff and filler <br/>
like morning assembly, no waiting for slowcoaches to catch up, no <br/>
strangers deciding what you should or shouldn&#39;t be interested in, no <br/>
obtaining knowledge in little bits at somebody else&#39;s whim, no <br/>
putting your hand up to get permission to go to the toilet instead of <br/>
just going when you need to, no eating by the clock instead of when <br/>
you&#39;re hungry, all those incidental things you get in a school <br/>
classroom that intelligent adults would feel insulted by but which <br/>
most teachers think is okay to impose on children. Now you can just <br/>
Get Educated without all the crap. And it costs less too. My wife and <br/>
I have saved a small fortune since our son&#39;s been at home and we <br/>
don&#39;t have to pay school fees and for uniforms and supplies. The <br/>
school my son went to was always after money for something or other, <br/>
much of it irrelevant to a &#39;good education&#39;. As private enterprise <br/>
takes over online education and more and more bricks and mortar <br/>
educational institutions put more and more of their opportunities <br/>
online, as they&#39;re starting to do, it&#39;s only a matter of time before <br/>
obtaining academic qualifications will be something anybody who wants <br/>
to have them can do from more or less the comfort of their own home. <br/>
My wife completed her MBA in 1996 through the Open University while <br/>
maintaining a full-time career job. Imagine how much easier getting a <br/>
university degree will be for unschoolers who want to do that when <br/>
they have all day free to study. Thanks to the Digital Revolution, <br/>
we&#39;ve entered a Golden Age of self-education unprecedented in human <br/>
history. The &#39;keepers of the school system&#39; are mostly in denial or <br/>
don&#39;t know how to change old habits, but I, for one, am very, very <br/>
pleased that my son has the opportunity to get an education in the <br/>
same way that any intelligent *adult* would get an education. On his <br/>
terms.<br/>
<br/>
My thoughts at the moment.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s very interesting. My daughter&#39;s schooling was a bit like that. <br/>
She went to school because she wanted to go. She started with a whole <br/>
bunch of children who&#39;d known each other since babyhood. It was a Big <br/>
Shared Adventure. My daughter was at the top of the class from the <br/>
beginning and throughout 12 years of schooling and there&#39;s no doubt <br/>
she enjoyed the rewards that went with that. If ever she&#39;d asked to <br/>
be taken out of school, I&#39;m sure my wife and I would have taken the <br/>
request seriously, but she never did. She liked school. I believe the <br/>
stability and support she had in her home life gave her the <br/>
confidence to accommodate the less than satisfactory aspects that <br/>
came along with the positive things that were important to her. Out <br/>
of school, my daughter did whatever she liked, the same as she had <br/>
done before she started school and the same as her brother does all <br/>
the time now. She was never asked to do her homework. Not once. She <br/>
did it anyway. I&#39;d never seen that before. Every other child I&#39;d ever <br/>
known, myself included, had to be cajoled into doing homework. Every <br/>
now and then, my daughter would decide she didn&#39;t want to go to <br/>
school that day and my wife and I would say, &quot;Sure, take the day <br/>
off.&quot; And the next day when I was writing the note for her teacher, <br/>
I&#39;d say, &quot;What do think, Bronwyn? Tummy upset? Sore throat?&quot; and <br/>
she&#39;d decide what I would write and we&#39;d both have a chuckle over <br/>
that. I&#39;d have much preferred to have been honest and written that my <br/>
daughter had been working very hard and decided to have an extra rest <br/>
day to keep her mind fresh, but schools do seem to prefer their silly <br/>
game. And, really, I quite enjoyed cheating at it. Much as my <br/>
daughter went to &#39;good schools&#39; and I genuinely respected many of her <br/>
teachers, I was never one for leaving what I wanted for my daughter <br/>
at the school gate. :)<br/>
<br/>
I was reading a few days ago about a workshop one of the <br/>
top &#39;parenting experts&#39; here in Australia is promoting: it&#39;s for <br/>
teachers - How to deal with difficult parents. And I thought to <br/>
myself, &quot;Yeah, I&#39;d like to see you deal with ME, mate.&quot; LOL<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I know, all nothing to do with unschooling. Just things reading <br/>
that article reminded me of. :)<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; So your parents lived vicariously through you, to some extent<br/>
 </span></blockquote>maybe?  That can&#39;t help but happen to some extent, but it&#39;s good to<br/>
know when it&#39;s happening and feel ourselves being aware of when we&#39;re<br/>
accepting our children&#39;s growth and when we&#39;re trying to build<br/>
new-improved Mini-Me&#39;s. &gt;&gt; <br/>
<br/>
This gave me some food for thought and left me pondering for an entire<br/>
day - about parents wanting to live vicariously through our children<br/>
and wanting a life path we didn&#39;t have.  <br/>
<br/>
You might remember, we have an 18mo son (Talon) and unschoolig is new<br/>
to us.  It&#39;s become my obsession, and my SO (Terry) has agreed to<br/>
follow my lead.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when we are discussing Talon&#39;s learning, Terry will<br/>
passionately mention the things he thinks are important for Talon to<br/>
learn (history), be involved in (sports), and do for the sake of<br/>
education (go to college).  These are all things important to Terry<br/>
himself.  History and sports are his passions, and the college thing<br/>
is something he wishes he would have done right out of high school. <br/>
<br/>
When Terry mentions these things, I will return comment something like<br/>
&quot;if Talon wants to&quot;, and at least once I went into my own rant about<br/>
how  terrible I think it is for parents to expect certain things and<br/>
shape their children&#39;s lives just so the parent can live vicariously<br/>
through them, and I pointed out that that&#39;s what Terry&#39;s ideas pointed<br/>
to.  <br/>
<br/>
I do actually feel this way, but the strong emotion I had attached to<br/>
that sentiment set off red flags for me.  I have learned in recent<br/>
years through my pursuit of personal growth (which I now understand to<br/>
have just been deschooling myself) that the things we judge or<br/>
criticize harshly in other people are in fact really just reflections<br/>
of something unsettling within ourselves.  (It&#39;s not the judgment or<br/>
criticism itself, but our strong attachment to that judgment.)   <br/>
<br/>
Knowing this, I then look at myself and ask &quot;what am I doing?&quot;  It&#39;s<br/>
made me wonder if I&#39;m doing no different than Terry, but with my<br/>
desires for Talon to be unschooled.  I was the child fighting for<br/>
respect and independence for as far back as my memory will take me. <br/>
I&#39;m the one who thinks how awesome it would have been to be unschooled<br/>
myself and parented respectfully, etc., etc.  Am I not doing the same<br/>
thing and trying to live vicariously through our son also?  <br/>
<br/>
So that&#39;s what I was thinking about today - all day.  I didn&#39;t have an<br/>
epiphany or come up with anything profound.  But when I came back<br/>
tonight and re-read Sandra&#39;s comment that it&#39;s just good to be aware,<br/>
then maybe that&#39;s what&#39;s I needed to learn or hear for myself.  I&#39;m<br/>
sure this will become clearer as Talon gets older.  He&#39;s already shown<br/>
signs of inheriting my independent streak, so perhaps he will have a<br/>
few things to show me about what that trait is really all about. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

job!&quot;  *sigh* &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When did this happen where society in general decided what was a real<br/>
job, a good living, the importance of a big career with a big fat<br/>
paycheck?  Was it politically driven?  Was it driven from the<br/>
depression era?  I really don&#39;t know, I&#39;m grabbing at straws.  <br/>
<br/>
This might go back to another of my posts about parents (in this case,<br/>
society or generations as a whole) wanting more for their children. <br/>
I&#39;m not sure.  But I do know that this is another one of those issues<br/>
that *irks* me because I wasted a lot of time in MY life following<br/>
these crazy rules and just as much time trying to undo the mess I got<br/>
myself into.  <br/>
<br/>
I got good grades in high school, went to college , and got myself a<br/>
respectable career with a decent paycheck - all for the approval of my<br/>
parents (and partly just to prove that I could) and because I was told<br/>
it was the key to *the good life*.  I was on track to meet all my<br/>
goals, including being married by the time I was 25 - you know,<br/>
because that&#39;s what we were told to do back then - set career and life<br/>
goals for ourselves.  I ended up depressed and having a mid-life<br/>
crisis at the ripe old age of 24.  I&#39;m 34 now and am just finally<br/>
starting to feel like a whole person again by reevaluating everything<br/>
in my life (deschooling, you could say), getting to know the REAL me<br/>
and what my interests and passions are, and making my own choices<br/>
accordingly.  <br/>
<br/>
Some people still think I&#39;m crazy that I gave up a job as a health<br/>
care administrator to work at home as a medical transcriptionist for<br/>
production pay.  I used to feel the need to justify myself and explain<br/>
to the hilt why I do what I do (that independence thing related to<br/>
working at home).  But the more comfortable I get in my own skin, the<br/>
less I feel the need to justify myself.   <br/>
<br/>
That being said, I still find myself get worked up from time to time<br/>
when the whole issue comes up of what society in general believes is<br/>
the right way to live, work, and play.  And so here I am again, I<br/>
guess back at the issue of wanting a better life for my son...  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1254928285">-=One of the few quotes I bothered to memorize in high school (and I<br/>
don&#39;t think I learned it there, but I always wrote it on my notebooks)<br/>
was &quot;Scientific fact is no more than purified human opinion.&quot;<br/>
I googled it but couldn&#39;t find who to attribute it to, sorry about<br/>
that. That quote always helped me out when people would spew<br/>
their &quot;facts.&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
It made you feel better, but it&#39;s not a good way to look at fact and  <br/>
opinion, I don&#39;t think.<br/>
<br/>
In a wholly unrelated discussion yesterday someone I&#39;ve known for 30  <br/>
years (not always happily) wrote &quot;That&#39;s your opinion,&quot; about  <br/>
something that happened, I was there, and I could dig up letters to  <br/>
prove it.  I&#39;m not going to.<br/>
<br/>
She was miffed because something had happened years ago that she  <br/>
hadn&#39;t known about (in the formation of an SCA kingdom, so fully  <br/>
documentable stuff).   Instead of writing about different people&#39;s  <br/>
opinions, she could have written &quot;It&#39;s your memory against mine&quot; or  <br/>
&quot;It&#39;s your word against mine.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In any case, I was right and she was wrong.  It&#39;s NOT a matter of  <br/>
opinion.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, it might have been too much information.  Most  <br/>
people like their history simple and clear and happy and sanitized.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some scientific fact seems clearly to be purified human opinion.  I  <br/>
see it in education and childrearing and medicine and sociology.     <br/>
Other things, though, surprise the heck out of people and they&#39;re   <br/>
not happy to have discovered them.  If fact goes against human  <br/>
opinion, then what?<br/>

thing and trying to live vicariously through our son also? -=-<br/>
<br/>
I think the first answer to most questions like that is &quot;it depends.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you manipulate the situation past the point that he has choices,  <br/>
maybe yes.<br/>
<br/>
If you keep the option open and appealing to him and he chooses it,  <br/>
then no!<br/>
<br/>
I enjoyed your thoughts about all that.  Thanks for writing them out  <br/>
so thoroughly.<br/>

Capitalism.   It&#39;s the religion of America.  Even churches say if you  <br/>
serve God you&#39;ll be rewarded, and they sometimes mean with success.<br/>
<br/>
I think school contributes too, with the competition for grades and  <br/>
ranks.  If a 98% is better than a 50%  (An A to an F!) then $98,000  <br/>
must be A-to-an-F to $50,000.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not enough that a house is warm and safe and doesn&#39;t leak.  It  <br/>
needs to be bigger than your relative&#39;s and friends&#39;.<br/>

Both men were speakers at the HomeSchool Association of California  <br/>
annual conference (in different years).  I had the opportunity to tell  <br/>
Mr. Smith his book was always the first I recommended to new  <br/>
homeschooling parents.  It goes far in explaining why people don&#39;t  <br/>
need school to truly learn, and why school teaching methods often  <br/>
inhibit learning.<br/>

<br/>
Luckily, Terry isn&#39;t a textbook kind of person, but I&#39;ve made note of<br/>
this book in case I need to offer it up.  Terry is a wealth of<br/>
information all in himself, but like anyone who has a passion for<br/>
their subject he can go on and on (and on and on).  I&#39;ve learned more<br/>
history from him than all my 17 years of schooling and even find<br/>
myself interested most of the time (I used to loathe history).  But<br/>
sometimes he&#39;s too much and even my eyes begin to glaze over.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see the other book (Learning & Forgetting) at our local<br/>
library, so I&#39;ve added it to my Amazon list (which seems to be getting<br/>
longer and longer by the day :-) <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the references. <br/>
