<div id="ygrps-yiv-1327813348">There  are other sports she is willing to try now----she would like to go<br/>
into  cheerleading and diving at the public school.  She feels there she<br/>
has  a chance to get as good as she can because it is free.   <br/>

****Once again I can mention my son Shawn.  He was a dedicated in  <br/>
gymnastics, but started late, and was too big. (not like your daughter -  but they still <br/>
had him teach) When he started community college he took a  diving class <br/>
which led him into that field.  Thro the years he performed in  a dive show and <br/>
became the national diving champion at his college for two years  running.  <br/>
Sometimes life has a way of taking a person to a different  path.  If it truly is <br/>
gymnastics I feel you and your family will find a way  to make it happen.  I <br/>
wish you the best.<br/>
