<div id="ygrps-yiv-953831799">Allie (10) wants to start public school this week.  I&#39;ve posted that <br/>
she&#39;s been bored, lonely, and restless.  I talked with her about ways <br/>
to be more social: getting a webcam and talking with friends online, <br/>
joining Girl Scouts and other classes, and making a point to get out <br/>
of the house every day just for a change of scenery.  She dismissed <br/>
all those ideas and insisted that being in public school was going to <br/>
be the best choice for her right now.<br/>
<br/>
I want to be supportive and most especially positive.  Besides my <br/>
personal experience with school, I know how being a student in school <br/>
has influenced her in the past.  She adapts to the general rhythm of <br/>
the kids around her which has not been really positive in my <br/>
opinion.  Then there are the school hours to consider.  Allie&#39;s <br/>
natural sleep/wake rhythm is to go to sleep around 2am and sleep <br/>
until past noon every day.  When she was in school last year, she got <br/>
angry that she had to try to fall asleep early in the evening in <br/>
order to wake up early in the morning.  And the mornings weren&#39;t <br/>
pleasant because she was always grumpy.  It was one of the biggest <br/>
reasons she chose to leave school last year.  That hasn&#39;t changed at <br/>
all during the year.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to become the mom who forces bedtimes and wake times but <br/>
I feel responsible for her getting up, even though she&#39;s the one who <br/>
has decided to go to school.  I really need some advice on how to <br/>
handle this.  I&#39;d love to let Allie go whenever she feels like it but <br/>
the whole idea of school is to be on their schedule.  After 5 <br/>
absences, the school social worker contacts the family to find out <br/>
why the student is missing school.  In order for absences to be <br/>
excused, we have to have a doctor&#39;s note.  What do I do if Allie <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to wake up for school?  Should I let her miss any days <br/>
she wants to miss or explain that the choice of school means <br/>
following their rules?<br/>
<br/>
My DH thinks Allie won&#39;t stay in school very long.  He thinks it will <br/>
give her something to focus on for a while until she&#39;s ready for a <br/>
change.  And he also said that when she leaves school it will be good <br/>
for her to have made all these decisions because we, the parents, <br/>
aren&#39;t imposing our own rules or expectations on her.  I&#39;m happy that <br/>
my DH is so on board for unschooling now, but I&#39;m just feeling really <br/>
bad about this whole school thing.<br/>

<br/>
Both?  But that doesn&#39;t mean you &quot;have to&quot; &quot;make her&quot; follow their  <br/>
rules.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could write a letter to the school saying your daughter  <br/>
likes beginnings of school, but you would personally prefer  <br/>
homeschooling.  You could ask if the school wants to  make an  <br/>
exception for her, and let her have more than the minimum absences.   <br/>
You could explain it all in the happiest and most positive way,  <br/>
saying you&#39;ll help her some but you won&#39;t force her to go; you won&#39;t  <br/>
sabotage it nor will you enforce school&#39;s rules.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if they see it&#39;s to their advantage to cut her a deal, they&#39;ll  <br/>
loosen up.<br/>
<br/>
They operate from the assumption that parents will back their plays.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; excused, we have to have a doctor&#39;s note.  What do I do if Allie<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This year my kids have tried public school.  Lydia wanted to go for<br/>
social reasons and Graham wanted to also.  I have them in two different<br/>
school districts because Lydia wanted to go to our neighborhood school<br/>
and Graham joined a lego league through a montessori school so wanted to<br/>
go there. ( I had them on the waiting list since Kindergarton at this<br/>
Montessori school in case they ever decided to go)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure where you live so I&#39;m not sure what the laws are.  Here in<br/>
Iowa they offer dual enrollment.  Graham is doing that.  He goes to<br/>
school for PE, art, music, lunch and recess.  The school is NOT<br/>
responsible for assessing him so they really don&#39;t care if he&#39;s there or<br/>
not!  Come when he wants, leave when he wants!  If he doesn&#39;t feel like<br/>
going (which one day this first week he didn&#39;t) I just shoot his teacher<br/>
an email.<br/>
<br/>
I had hoped Lydia would do the same (dual enrollment) but she wanted to<br/>
try the whole deal.  She had a bike accident right before school started<br/>
and we&#39;ve been to quite a few dentist appointments and doctors<br/>
appointments.  I asked Lydia if she wanted to go during the day or after<br/>
school.  She prefers to go during the day so I have her leave.  Needless<br/>
to say, I am already getting looks and they are making things more<br/>
difficult than they have to.  Personally, I don&#39;t mind, it just<br/>
reinforces to Lydia the negatives of school life.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my point is different districts may have different tolerance<br/>
levels.  Different types of schools (montessori, private, charter) have<br/>
different philosophies so I would do your research. Also find out your<br/>
states homeschool laws and find out your options!<br/>
<br/>
Lydia was asking me how much school she could miss and if she could show<br/>
up late.  I told her, that if it got to the point that she wasn&#39;t really<br/>
wanting to go or be there that she would either have to switch to dual<br/>
enrollment or go back to homeschool/unschool because at some point I<br/>
will be held legally liable.  I&#39;ll let it go as far as I can for her. <br/>
She is informed and sets her alarm and gets up before everyone else in<br/>
the house.  I usually hear her so then get up and see her off.  If she<br/>
needed my help getting up and getting to bed I would help her.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t want to become the mom who forces bedtimes and wake times but<br/>
&gt; I feel responsible for her getting up, even though she&#39;s the one who<br/>
&gt; has decided to go to school.  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Talk to her ahead of time.  Talk about the realities.  See if she can<br/>
just go in the afternoons??<br/>
<br/>
Lydia asked me if she would have a bedtime when school started!  I said<br/>
with a smile, do you want a bedtime?   She shrugged like she thought<br/>
that would go with it.  I told her I function best with 8 hours of sleep<br/>
and someone your age probably functions best with 10.  But try it out<br/>
yourself.  So, she is.  She&#39;s gone to bed a different times and some<br/>
days she&#39;s been dragging more than others.<br/>
<br/>
I do know friends in the public school system who travel a lot and miss<br/>
way more than the amount of time they&#39;re &quot;allowed&quot; to miss.  So, I&#39;m<br/>
sure if you talk to the school and have a reason to be gone, they MAY be<br/>
more understanding.<br/>
<br/>
I know I have organized some field trips and plays this upcoming year<br/>
and Lydia still wants to go.  So, we&#39;ll have to see how the school<br/>
reacts.  If it&#39;s negative, it&#39;ll just put a more positive light on our<br/>
unschooling life!<br/>

<br/>
Yes.  If they choose NOT to be more understanding, that&#39;s one less  <br/>
head to count when they claim state funding, and one more unschooler  <br/>
at your house!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I live in Georgia.  I&#39;ve talked with lots of homeschoolers, school <br/>
officials in two counties, and a couple of teachers.  The only way <br/>
I&#39;ve found to do part-time school is to have a special IEP which is a <br/>
special plan written for special education students.  Even then, the <br/>
special ed teacher who told me about it said the school officials <br/>
would never tell me about it or offer it.  Instead, I&#39;d be better off <br/>
hiring an attorney to send letters to make sure the IEP was not only <br/>
written, but followed.  Oh, and this woman&#39;s advice was her way of <br/>
getting my son into school where she believes he&#39;d be more successful <br/>
in life.  I&#39;m thinking if I have to go through all that for what the <br/>
schools to consider to be special ed, they aren&#39;t likely going to <br/>
work nicely with me for a non-special ed student.<br/>
<br/>
However, I am willing to try talking with the principal again.  She <br/>
knows me from our previous time there.  I will call tuesday morning <br/>
to see if I can speak with her.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I also talked with a Montessori school last year.  I asked if I <br/>
could pay full tuition and have my daughter attend only part of the <br/>
day and they said it wasn&#39;t possible.  I was surprised because they <br/>
were a private school.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I know I have organized some field trips and plays this upcoming<br/>
&gt; year and Lydia still wants to go.  So, we&#39;ll have to see how the<br/>
&gt; school reacts.  If it&#39;s negative, it&#39;ll just put a more positive<br/>
&gt; light on our unschooling life!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s considered an unexcused absence in our state.  I explained the <br/>
absences to the teachers and school principals but they said their <br/>
hands were tied because of school policy.  I wish we lived in a state <br/>
that was more flexible.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll see how that phone call goes on tuesday with the principal.<br/>
