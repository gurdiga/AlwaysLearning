<div id="ygrps-yiv-521922352">In case anyone wondered... I was gone for a bit.  We went out of town <br/>
for a week to spend time with some friends.  A week is a long time it <br/>
seems.<br/>
<br/>
This trip was mostly planned for Chamille, 14, to see a friend of <br/>
hers that lives about 12 hrs away.  We split the difference and met <br/>
in the middle in a small town with nothing particular going on.  It <br/>
was a little dull on the things to do list, but we all got a lot of <br/>
social time.  It&#39;s a beautiful time of year to go on a road trip!<br/>
<br/>
So much of the time in our house I spend time with Chamille and my <br/>
husband spends time with Margaux, 7, in order to meet their needs we <br/>
often split up this way.<br/>
<br/>
Since we were meeting a friend for Chamille, I got to spend a lot of <br/>
time with Margaux and it was awesome.  Chamille and Margaux have <br/>
found a new appreciation for one another as siblings.  Margaux is a <br/>
very intense person and can really push Chamille&#39;s buttons.<br/>
<br/>
While we were gone Margaux&#39;s intensity was really bothering this <br/>
other friend and she didn&#39;t know how to be nice to Margaux when <br/>
Margaux was being her intense little self.  Margaux handled herself <br/>
in a very mature manner and Chamille realized how well Margaux was <br/>
behaving and how unfair it seemed.  She actually felt a little bit <br/>
protective for her sister, which is really really cool because she <br/>
doesn&#39;t usually feel that way towards her, she often feels annoyed by <br/>
her, and often for good reason.<br/>
<br/>
So Margaux realized how very patient Chamille is and how Chamille <br/>
really doesn&#39;t do mean and hurtful things to her until she has <br/>
crossed the lines that are really obvious even to her.  And Chamille <br/>
realized how cool her sister can be and how mature she can handle <br/>
herself and that she really doesn&#39;t have to be annoying and won&#39;t be <br/>
if treated respectfully.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had a chance to talk with each one individually and deeply about <br/>
it and both of them really really love each other and have a new <br/>
desire to be kinder and nicer to each other because they both <br/>
understand new things about themselves and how they relate to each <br/>
other.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not like they&#39;ve ever hated each other, and their relationship <br/>
has always been nicer on the whole when compared to other siblings we <br/>
know, but there has been this area of button pushing to get the other <br/>
to react that has been present a lot.  I thought perhaps it was <br/>
jealousy, and maybe it is, but whatever it was/is, they have a whole <br/>
new take on each other and it&#39;s super cool!</div>
