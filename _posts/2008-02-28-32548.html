When my daughters&#39; friends all went to kindergarten, and she didn&#39;t,  <br/>
she didn&#39;t care - she felt sorry for them. The only thing that came up  <br/>
in play was them mentioning their &quot;teacher&quot; - she wanted one, too. So  <br/>
we signed her up for a one-week, 2 hours per day, science fun class  <br/>
and for the next year she would casually say, &quot;Well, MY teacher  <br/>
said....&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
That was enough for her.<br/>
<br/>
But, seriously, she might just not care at all. Make sure her life is  <br/>
so sparkly and good that she wouldn&#39;t want to leave it.<br/>

I worried about the same thing when my eldest daughter was 5.  We had no problems.  We got involved in our own homeschool stuff, met and played with other homeschoolers, and enjoyed playing with schooled friends when they came home from school.  It&#39;s been that way ever since.  I mean, it&#39;s real life still and we have friend troubles now and again but most of the time, things are fine.  The problems come when they get older than five and get homework and become involved in too many after school activities so they aren&#39;t AROUND enough.. But that&#39;s not a problem with everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>

Find some unschoolers, or at least other unschoolers.  Go on some  <br/>
trips--day trips, overnighters, do things with  her that other kids  <br/>
her age can&#39;t do.<br/>
<br/>
If she wants to take a dance class or art or acting/performance or  <br/>
something, maybe that could be fun.  Maybe the two of you could start  <br/>
a photography project,  maybe a blog of the fun things you do together.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Invite her friends over sometimes and keep them all so busy with fun  <br/>
stuff that they don&#39;t have time or need to talk about school.  Show  <br/>
them how fun her unschooling life is.  Or take them all to an  <br/>
amusement park or Chuck E Cheese or something.<br/>
<br/>
It will cost money for you to go that direction, but a visit with a  <br/>
counsellor can be $80, $100 or more, and if this can prevent  <br/>
unhappiness and problems, it&#39;s money well spent.  If it gives her a  <br/>
chance to hang out with her friends, it&#39;s worth it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Those aren&#39;t all the possible ideas, but they&#39;re a few.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2112330885">Hi Marcia--<br/>
<br/>
My advice to you is to look for other unschoolers/homeschoolers and don&#39;t look back.  As <br/>
my daughter&#39;s friends started school they had little time for her.  There was some time in <br/>
kindergarten, but on into 1st and 2nd grade they really disappeared.  Seek out new friends <br/>
of like mind and build your tribe--sometimes it not easy. <br/>
<br/>
Until we moved I was driving 1 1/2 hours each way to hook up with unschoolers.  I <br/>
thought I&#39;d never do that, but my efforts to create a community where I lived just didn&#39;t <br/>
work.  We also started going to unschooling conferences, campouts, etc.  We really looked <br/>
to create a different sort of life than the school people were leading.  I have to say the <br/>
payoff for the whole family has been soooo worth it.  Neither of my children are feeling at <br/>
all lacking for friends and we have a very grounding feeling of belonging to smaller <br/>
communities within larger communities.  There is a feeling of rightness that permeates <br/>
our lives, even when we are spending days on end at home.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not suggesting that you need to do what I did--but you may have to get out of your <br/>
comfort zone if that&#39;s what&#39;s called for.  Your lives will be so filled that your daughter <br/>
won&#39;t feel a lack.  I know my response wasn&#39;t quite what you asked, but I know enough <br/>
people whose problem was that their child then wanted to go to school because all of her <br/>
friends had gone off to school that I thought I&#39;d save you the trouble of typing up that <br/>
post and just answer it.  :-) Good luck, Joanna<br/>
