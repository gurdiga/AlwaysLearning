<div id="ygrps-yiv-1719204985">Ok, I can finally sit at the computer and tell you about the<br/>
melodrama.<br/>
<br/>
It was great (only a few drawbacks - like 2 busloads of school kids,<br/>
a <br/>
few whom decided to throw skittles onto the stage while the actors<br/>
were <br/>
performing - I wanted to yell &quot;look how good the homeschoolers are!&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
But the play was fun, a bit scary - but not too, my 5 year old loved <br/>
it.  (Dr. Jykell and Mr. Hyde).  Afterward there was a vaudville <br/>
routine which was hit and miss, but still good.<br/>
<br/>
We plan on going once a month from now on.  We can get in as a group, <br/>
ok, we have to be with kids from schools, but the price is right.<br/>
<br/>
I started an umbrella school this year and have been tracking what my <br/>
kids do during the day (as an example for the other families in my <br/>
school) and have been surprised by what we do in one day.  <br/>
Piano, karate, reading, math, writing, discussions, gardening, etc...<br/>
 <br/>
All of it from unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for this peaceful list with no proselytizing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2120152076">My 2 older dds (12,10)had their first choir/music lesson today with our <br/>
homeschool group.  The instructor informed us after the 1 hour lesson that <br/>
if this were a public school class, it would have taken 2 months to get to <br/>
the point where our homeschooled children were at.<br/>
