Would she be interested in a dream journal?  She could<br/>
list and describe her inventions...or draw pictures of<br/>
them?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Heather, that sounds like a good idea for some time in the future.  If I gave her a journal now, she would think it was a school thing.  She is starting to heal but is still very angry about what school has done to her.  She says she thinks it ruined her and she hopes she will be able to get over it someday.  I keep telling her we have only been homeschooling/unschooling for 5 months and look how much better she feels, just think how you will be in a year or two or three.  Poor kid.<br/>
