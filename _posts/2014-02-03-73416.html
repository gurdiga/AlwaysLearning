 </span></blockquote>Since our son goes to sleep when we do (usually after midnight), and sleeps at least ten hours, my husband and I have the mornings to connect.  As well, I occasionally wake in the middle of the night.  I often go sit in the living room to read a while.  Sometimes he stirs when I come back to bed.  I find that&#39;s a nice time to connect, then fall back to sleep for a few more hours.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-192844528">I started strewing things for my husband- I won&#39;t get into details, but leaving things or videos and such, in his drawer or in the Netflix queue (we all share one, but my kids dont access it yet)- letting him know I&#39;m thinking of it too- and we make the connection when we can.  I think for some men that might be frustrating, like a tease, but mine seems like it.  I stopped rolling my eyes at all his &#39;thats what she said&#39; jokes, and now I laugh. I joke back. A nice 20 second kiss in the hallway or at the computer chair can be wonderful.  I stopped getting irritated when he would grab my butt and such- now I flirt back.  He&#39;s been in a much better mood more often since I started making more of an effort in that department.  And I&#39;d sort of forgotten how much I enjoyed it too. My youngest is still nursing quite a bit, and my hormones haven&#39;t shifted back to having any sort of hormonally-motivated desire yet.  It takes some concentrated effort for me to get my mind there, but it&#39;s worth it. :)<br/>
