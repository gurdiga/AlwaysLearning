&lt;&lt; In theory it seems to make sense, but now that I&#39;m doing it I have my <br/>
doubts.  My three year old has been eating nothing but junk food all <br/>
day.  Today he ate...a few breadsticks in the morning.  Nothing but <br/>
soda to drink all day.  A few bites of pizza for lunch, a pack of <br/>
cupcakes.  Supper, a few bites of noodles and one bite of carrot.  <br/>
He&#39;ll probably want cookies tonight.  I don&#39;t know, it just doesn&#39;t <br/>
seem healthy enough.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t work in a day or a week or a month.  It works when it&#39;s longterm <br/>
and people around are modelling good choices.  <br/>
<br/>
School used to say every  meal should be balanced, and that itself was news <br/>
and political correctness to try to get people into mainstream eating and <br/>
away from the beans and tortillas or cornbread and beans (to speak for my own <br/>
neighborhood&#39;s traditional non-meat dinners when I was a kid), to stress the <br/>
importance of protein and to encourage people to eat fruit and vegetables <br/>
more.<br/>
<br/>
When my mom was a kid they got oranges at Christmas only.  When my <br/>
grandmother was a kid they only ate what they could grow or trade with the <br/>
neighbors.  Our worldwide variety of out-of-season-here (or Never will grow <br/>
here, wherever &quot;here&quot; might be) is recent and unnatural.  So for us to expect <br/>
that &quot;a balanced diet&quot; fifth-grade-health-book style is crucial to daily <br/>
survival is wrong.<br/>
<br/>
If we balance out over a few days it&#39;s fine.  Some people need more protein <br/>
than others for their own personal blood-sugar/biochemical/metabolic <br/>
purposes.  I get a headache if I go too long without protein.  Kirby does <br/>
too. Marty and Keith never do.<br/>
Some people crave juice (Keith) or carbohydrates (Holly, the skinniest person <br/>
in our family).  By pre-deciding what people will eat, moms don&#39;t allow for <br/>
individual needs.<br/>
<br/>
Same with TV or decisions about what to wear or other freedoms, a sudden <br/>
change from control to choice will result in a kind of shadow-show of what <br/>
choices really weren&#39;t allowed before.   If the choice-giving is new, kids <br/>
WILL watch &quot;too much&quot; TV, or play video games an extremely long time, but <br/>
it&#39;s either celebration or a frantic grab because of fear that the privilege <br/>
will be withdrawn.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;a few breadsticks in the morning.  Nothing but <br/>
soda to drink all day.  A few bites of pizza for lunch, a pack of <br/>
cupcakes.  Supper, a few bites of noodles and one bite of carrot.  <br/>
He&#39;ll probably want cookies tonight. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like a lot of food.  Does he have the option to get more between meals <br/>
if he&#39;s hungry?  If he&#39;s NOT hungry, compare his haul of yesterday to what <br/>
some of the other kids in the world had access to or were privileged to eat <br/>
yesterday.  I bet if you counted the calories he was well within a healthy <br/>
range of intake.<br/>
<br/>
There was news about water consumption lately.  I&#39;ll put that in a different <br/>
post.<br/>
