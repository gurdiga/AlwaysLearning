<div id="ygrps-yiv-1829892784">How do you let someone down gently without making it ugly? i&#39;m in a<br/>
social situation whereby the mother is kinda ok, but the kid&#39;s not.<br/>
<br/>
8 months ago, we have made friends with another homeschooling<br/>
family - mother with 10 yr old son. Initially, DS like this kid<br/>
enough to want to play with him, so we organised playdates on and<br/>
off. We have had a few sleep over before at our house, but it&#39;s<br/>
quite disasterous so I never repeat it again.<br/>
<br/>
Plus i believed he was going thru some deschooling (at that time,<br/>
just out of school) of some sort, so having this kid over is hard<br/>
work - he&#39;s really loud and boistorous and swears alot and i do<br/>
believe him to be rude. One time, he critised my driving, all the<br/>
way his house to my house, a 40 minutes drive thru town, during<br/>
after office hour!! LOL! When i told his mum about it, she didn&#39;t<br/>
even apologised, but just acknowlded that he is the back seat<br/>
driver. So, yes, it does stresses me and my hubby out alot when he&#39;s<br/>
here LOL!<br/>
<br/>
But because DS likes him, i had to entertain DS&#39;s request for this<br/>
friend to come over. The reason we&#39;re always having playdates in our<br/>
house is because this family&#39;s house is digustingly dirty. I&#39;m not<br/>
being snotty but would you sent your kid over if there&#39;s broken<br/>
glass on the floor, remains of a long ago broken window pane, or<br/>
dead rats brought in by the cats, still scattered at the entrance<br/>
hall, tumb tacks lying around, and I have yet to see the floor being<br/>
swept in all the time I&#39;ve known them. Sorry, i&#39;m not being fussy or<br/>
choosy, but i would rather have my kid at home because my kid likes<br/>
to play on floors.<br/>
<br/>
But in the past few weeks, it&#39;s finally sinking into DS that this<br/>
kid is constantly upsetting him. For a start, my kid hates it when<br/>
this kid swears at anything, and sometimes including him. DS has a<br/>
chat with his friend and even after promising he&#39;ll try not to swear<br/>
so much, he&#39;s still doing it.<br/>
<br/>
And the few times we went over to them, DS always gets upset because<br/>
he claimed his friend is not being very nice, and doesn&#39;t treat him<br/>
like a visiting guest, wouldn&#39;t let him play the games he wants to<br/>
play, and one time told DS to &quot;shut up&quot; when he just switch off the<br/>
Indiana Jones movie that DS was wathcing half way thru.<br/>
<br/>
Now, DS has always been taught to be nice to guest, and that guests<br/>
alway get first preferance when they are in our house. If we don&#39;t<br/>
feel like being nice to anyone, we don&#39;t invite anyone home. So DS<br/>
thought it was really not fair when this kid visit us, DS is being<br/>
the polite host, but it&#39;s not vice versa. So DS is beginning to not<br/>
like this kid so much.<br/>
<br/>
I try not to interfere, hoping and allowing DS to resolve his own<br/>
friednship(which he ahsn&#39;t got many anyway) issue. The last few<br/>
times me and DS had a chat about this, i suggested DS to talk to his<br/>
friend about it, which DS did, and it kinda work for a while.<br/>
<br/>
But this afternnon at the park with a few more newly made friends<br/>
from the HE groups, something happened and DS is adamant he doesn&#39;t<br/>
want this kid to come over anymore. He doesn&#39;t wanna be friends<br/>
anymore with this kid. It does seems like this time, it&#39;s for real<br/>
because DS is adamant that this kid has no consideration about other<br/>
people&#39;s feelings, because &quot;he keep trying to spoil the game for<br/>
everyone&quot;. DS maintained this kid wouldn&#39;t listen and wouldnt&#39; stop<br/>
when everyone told him to stop aggresively hitting the big log that<br/>
they were playing on. DS maintained this kid does not respect him at<br/>
all because he is still swearing, and that this kid is very selfish,<br/>
think of himself only and DS said he doesn&#39;t want this kind of<br/>
friend.<br/>
<br/>
My response was we all have weird characters, and perhaps this<br/>
friend cannot control himself that well, when he&#39;s excited. Yes, he<br/>
swears but it doesn&#39;t mean that he&#39;s bad because we know he&#39;s not. I<br/>
suggested perhaps this kid is just goin thru some issues. But<br/>
anyhow, i told him i&#39;ll respect whatever decision he&#39;ll make about<br/>
this kid, but i did urged him to give it a few days of thought<br/>
before deciding. I also left him with the advice of that if we like<br/>
a friend, we should be tolerant and accpeting of thier short<br/>
comings, just as he(DS) would like other people to be tolerant and<br/>
accpeting of his differences.<br/>
<br/>
DS is still angry and adamant he doesn&#39;t want them visiting.<br/>
<br/>
Now this kid has been asking to come over many times, especially<br/>
earlier this morning during the HomeEd group. How am I to tell the<br/>
mum tomorrow (we have another common Home-ed group to attend) that<br/>
DS doesn&#39;t want them coming over, because they will suggest coming<br/>
over after the group? This mum is quite a sensitive person, easily<br/>
offended and very very defensive.<br/>
<br/>
Last time when I tried to tell her what happened during the sleep<br/>
over, how her son was still jumping up and down shouting away at<br/>
11.30pm and how another time we nearly lost him in Legoland because<br/>
HE decided he&#39;ll go check out some other rides on his own- it didn&#39;t<br/>
go down well. When I tried hint to her about how stressful it was<br/>
with her kid, and that I might not be in contact so much because of<br/>
this, she never once apologised or acknowledge that she understood.<br/>
Once this kid even had a asthma attack at 1am in the morning!! When<br/>
I called the mother, she deny the kid&#39;s got asthma, she kept<br/>
saying &quot;this is un-usual, it&#39;s never happened before&quot; but it was<br/>
clearly the kid was wheezing very loudly, and I shoudl know because<br/>
I&#39;m asthmatic. When she heard this, she suggested that I give him<br/>
some puffs off my inhaler because he has done it before with hers!!!<br/>
<br/>
I do feel very bad for the child because i really felt it&#39;s not fair<br/>
for this kid to lose a friend because of his behaviour, and i don&#39;t<br/>
want this kid to lose self esteem (very fragile) because of his<br/>
behaviour again (same reason why he&#39;s so unpopular in previous<br/>
school).<br/>
<br/>
So how can I distance myself without making this ugly?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1554831530">I&#39;ve seen a lot of different conditions in the homes of people and some<br/>
might not neglect beyond crappy conventional parenting and being dirty<br/>
around the house (sign of depression I think).  I&#39;d hate to think of an<br/>
already sad family made sadder by my noseyness unless it&#39;s absolutely<br/>
necessary.  I remember a kid in particular in school.  He might have been<br/>
abused but I don&#39;t know... he didn&#39;t seem that unhappy about it.  He always<br/>
smelled of dirty soiled undies and sniffed his nose constantly like he could<br/>
really use some help getting clean.  Seemed to me to have a pretty good<br/>
outlook though, even if he was mean occasionally.  He mostly kept to<br/>
himself.  I think he managed not to end up in a foster home away from his<br/>
family, whoever they were.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-367843780">&lt;&lt;&lt;So how can I distance myself without making this ugly?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This sounds like a very painful situation. I have been in one before too. I <br/>
don&#39;t think that you can control whether something gets ugly, since you <br/>
can&#39;t control another person&#39;s reaction. It&#39;s probably no good to try to <br/>
help with the obvious parenting problems unless the other mom has asked for <br/>
it. Is there really any way to say &quot;we don&#39;t like your child&quot; without it <br/>
being painful?<br/>
<br/>
That being said, all you can do is be as kind and brief as you can. With the <br/>
mom you might try something like, &quot;They aren&#39;t a good fit at the moment.&quot; I <br/>
would avoid getting drawn in to revealing details, unless you want to take <br/>
on the character of an intervention. With the boy...gosh that&#39;s even harder. <br/>
How much do you want to take on in telling the boy about his own behavior <br/>
now, when it&#39;s kinda too late? How about &quot;We are going to take a break from <br/>
playdates for a little while.&quot; I&#39;d keep a sharp eye on him if he comes to <br/>
parkday, be a close presence even if it means missing out on the <br/>
mom-chatting, since he might react badly to the restriction. He already <br/>
sounds like he has a bunch of anger with no safe outlet.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure she knows her house is dirty. She may be in denial about the extent <br/>
or the real effects of her house. I wonder if it would be taken well if you <br/>
and some of the other moms were to say to the dirty one, &quot;It looks like you <br/>
have gotten a bit overwhelmed with your house. Can we come and help?&quot; and do <br/>
a group clean up day....I don&#39;t know. They sound like a candidate for that <br/>
BBCA tv show &quot;How Clean Is Your House?&quot; In that they bring in a crew of <br/>
about 6 or 7 people to clean and professional carpet cleaners. They show the <br/>
homemaker various tricks, and help them make a schedule for themselves. Also <br/>
they send swabs and dead bugs &quot;to the lab&quot; to tangibly demonstrate the <br/>
health dangers of having mold and carrion about. It always makes me feel two <br/>
things - way better about my house in general, and eager to do some <br/>
cleaning.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt; I try not to interfere, hoping and allowing DS to resolve his own<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; friednship(which he ahsn&#39;t got many anyway) issue. The last few<br/>
&gt; times me and DS had a chat about this, i suggested DS to talk to his<br/>
&gt; friend about it, which DS did, and it kinda work for a while.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In the interests of the future - I&#39;m thinking your son needed you to <br/>
interfere a long time ago, so that it never got to the situation that it is <br/>
now. The other boy probably needed any directive to come from an authority <br/>
figure - the parent. I would suggest you say very firmly, &quot;It bothers us <br/>
when you use that kind of language. Please find better words.&quot; Also if the <br/>
backseat driving bothered me and he didn&#39;t stop when asked, I would pull the <br/>
car over. &quot;I really don&#39;t need your help driving. I&#39;ll drive on when you are <br/>
ready to be quiet (or talk about something else).&quot; I&#39;m guessing he hears <br/>
adults in his family doing it. If a child doesn&#39;t have empathy or doesn&#39;t <br/>
know how to behave kindly, he needs more instruction, more explanation of <br/>
our boundaries - even if we wouldn&#39;t need to direct our own unschooled <br/>
children in that way.<br/>
<br/>
I would absolutely not leave it up to Jayn to tell one of her visitors about <br/>
something that was bothering me. I would not leave it up to Jayn to enforce <br/>
or even express such restrictions on behavior as we have for guests in our <br/>
home. I would be a much closer presence during visits.<br/>
<br/>
I understand how tempting it is to just let a relationship with an <br/>
uncongenial child or family implode, as seems to have happened now. Then you <br/>
never have to deal with your own feelings of repugnance. I&#39;m going through <br/>
it some - BUT I know that Jayn&#39;s affection for kids (even those I may not <br/>
like) means that she will struggle to keep the relationship going until it <br/>
gets to disaster and ends badly, instead of just coming to a place of <br/>
equilibrium and reasonable peace. I have come to the conclusion that it is <br/>
best to be honest about my misgivings about a child&#39;s character, but also to <br/>
ask Jayn what she thinks, and what she needs from me.<br/>
<br/>
I have taken on the responsibility to do whatever I can to help the <br/>
playdates be pleasant. Equilibrium might mean that we only meet at parks or <br/>
outings or our house, or that I make myself a much more visible presence, or <br/>
that I ask for something very specific from the other mom. (EG to avoid <br/>
using well meaning but vague words like &quot;later&quot; but instead be really clear <br/>
that they will be home too late to play tonight.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1358304945">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks for your replies. I&#39;m sorry to say this. I thought I&#39;ll <br/>
have the chance to gather everyone&#39;s view here before approaching <br/>
her some other day. Unfortunately, other than reading the Laura&#39;s <br/>
first reply, i didn&#39;t have the wisdom i needed, when the opportunity <br/>
arises today, for me and this mom to have a quiet chat. I guessed I <br/>
ws so stressed with her son baraging me about coming to my house, in <br/>
front of everyone, and me, kinda lost for words for I really didn&#39;t <br/>
know how to lie to this kid anymore. When the opportunity arises to <br/>
speak to her privately, I felt i just had to speak to her and tell <br/>
her the reason we&#39;re not doing anymore playdates or sleepover, and <br/>
to bring up the issues betweem our kids, and I supposed I was hoping <br/>
she&#39;ll say she understand and will speak to her son about it, and <br/>
hopefully we&#39;ll be able to work this out. <br/>
<br/>
No, it didn;t happen. She insisted that her kid is not wrong, and <br/>
she blamed the Grand Theft Auto for her kid&#39;s swearing (so this is a <br/>
personal poke at me because it is thru my kid&#39;s playing that she&#39;s <br/>
convinced that it&#39;s ok for her son to play too, despite her earlier <br/>
misgivings about GTA), and she think&#39;s I should talk to my kid about <br/>
being not so sensitive (double poke!!). When I&#39;m brought up the <br/>
suggestion that maybe she needs to talk to her kid about <br/>
consideration for other people&#39;s feelings and the consequences of <br/>
his actions and swearings (because it is obvious now that she and <br/>
her kid is no longer welcome in quite a number household tho I <br/>
didn&#39;t tell her.) She thinks that I ws imposing my ideas upon her <br/>
when she didn&#39;t need it - in not many words, I&#39;m such a high and <br/>
mighty bi**h. <br/>
<br/>
Well, i supposed i know where we both stand now. At least I don&#39;t <br/>
have to continue giving excuses out or avoid them. <br/>
<br/>
I am hurting and confused because I didn&#39;t realised how intrusive I <br/>
was to her. As I&#39;m writing this, I am crying but I dont&#39;know why. <br/>
Maybe it&#39;s the shock of it all. Thank you for your replies and <br/>
support, it is giving me big comfort now to read it, knowing that <br/>
it&#39;s only common sense to do what I had to do. Yes, I agree, my kid <br/>
couldn&#39;t have possibly handle this well. <br/>
<br/>
On the subject of abuse - This kid is very much loved by his mum, <br/>
which is perhaps why she&#39;s so defensive, and blinkered with her <br/>
views. It is true a dirty house is no indication of abuse or <br/>
neglect. It&#39;s just the way they live, and they are happy about it, <br/>
and I have always respected that. It&#39;s just that I didn&#39;t want my <br/>
son rolling on such dirty and dangerous floor. <br/>
<br/>
Once again, I just want everyone to know how grateful I am for your <br/>
replies, despite the fact I&#39;ve acted, before reading most fo them. <br/>
<br/>
Hugs,<br/>
SharonBugs.</div>

<br/>
Why talk to his mom about it?  She wasn&#39;t even in the car.  Tell the  <br/>
kid to be quiet while you&#39;re driving, and mean it.<br/>

-=-The reason we&#39;re always having playdates in our house is because  <br/>
this family&#39;s house is digustingly dirty.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Why not at a public place?  A park?  Miniature golf?  Hiking?  Picnic?<br/>
<br/>
-=- I&#39;m not being snotty but would you sent your kid over if there&#39;s  <br/>

glass on the floor, remains of a long ago broken window pane, or<br/>
dead rats brought in by the cats, still scattered at the entrance<br/>
hall, tumb tacks lying around, and I have yet to see the floor being<br/>
swept in all the time I&#39;ve known them. Sorry, i&#39;m not being fussy or<br/>
choosy, but i would rather have my kid at home because my kid likes<br/>
to play on floors.-=-<br/>
<br/>
This is too much information if you&#39;re also going to say &quot;sorry&quot; and  <br/>
&quot;not fussy or choosy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
First, I wouldn&#39;t &quot;send&quot; my kid to play where she didn&#39;t want to play  <br/>
at all.  Would I allow her to play in a dangerous place? If she  <br/>
wanted to, and if there was a way for her to contact me to come and  <br/>
get her the moment she was unhappy with it, sure.  I have.<br/>
<br/>
-=-i would rather have my kid at home because my kid likes to play on  <br/>
floors.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Does your kid like to play on dead rats, thumb tacks and broken  <br/>
glass?  I seriously doubt it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-For a start, my kid hates it when this kid swears at anything, and  <br/>
sometimes including him. DS has a chat with his friend and even after  <br/>
promising he&#39;ll try not to swear so much, he&#39;s still doing it.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Your child asked you for help.  Telling the kid to talk to the other  <br/>
kid might not be the kind of help he wanted.  Stick around close  <br/>
enough to hear what they say, and stop the kid every time he says  <br/>
something  you don&#39;t want said.  That&#39;s mom help.  Or tell your kid  <br/>
to let it slide.  But sending a child to do a mom&#39;s job doesn&#39;t seem  <br/>
the best thing.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Now, DS has always been taught to be nice to guest, and that guests<br/>
<br/>
alway get first preferance when they are in our house. If we don&#39;t<br/>
feel like being nice to anyone, we don&#39;t invite anyone home. So DS<br/>
thought it was really not fair when this kid visit us, DS is being<br/>
the polite host, but it&#39;s not vice versa.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If your policy is to give guests their preferences, that makes you  <br/>
good hosts.  You can&#39;t enforce that on other people, though.  Life  <br/>
isn&#39;t &quot;fair.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-DS maintained this kid wouldn&#39;t listen and wouldnt&#39; stop when  <br/>
everyone told him to stop aggresively hitting the big log that they  <br/>
were playing on.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Where were the parents?<br/>
<br/>
-=-. But<br/>
<br/>
anyhow, i told him i&#39;ll respect whatever decision he&#39;ll make about<br/>
this kid, but i did urged him to give it a few days of thought<br/>
before deciding.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t have to be all or nothing.  Kids get older and wiser, or  <br/>
older and worse, but you don&#39;t need to decide this week whether  <br/>
you&#39;ll never see him again.  You could have a few months off without  <br/>
a permanent, lifelong decision.<br/>

Neither we nor child protective services should assume that a  <br/>
description of a situation is absolutely factual and objective.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s talk about unschooling and leave the secondary and tertiary  <br/>
stories where they are.  It&#39;s a big world, and the list is already a  <br/>
flood these days.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1080453467">-=I&#39;m thinking your son needed you to<br/>
interfere a long time ago, so that it never got to the situation that  <br/>
it is<br/>
now. The other boy probably needed any directive to come from an  <br/>
authority<br/>
figure - the parent. I would suggest you say very firmly, &quot;It bothers us<br/>
when you use that kind of language. Please find better words.&quot; Also  <br/>
if the<br/>
backseat driving bothered me and he didn&#39;t stop when asked, I would  <br/>
pull the<br/>
car over. &quot;I really don&#39;t need your help driving.-=-<br/>

Robyn had already written some of what I recommended.  I&#39;m sorry to  <br/>
be repetitive.  I got two days behind on e-mail and am not catching  <br/>
up in an orderly fashion.<br/>
<br/>
One good thing about two people saying the same thing, though... it  <br/>
must be true. &lt;bwg&gt;  (Not really, but it sounds good sometimes to  <br/>
think it.)<br/>
