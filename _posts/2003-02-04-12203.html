As in, &quot;I don&#39;t care if you don&#39;t like school, you will go to school and<br/>
like it!&quot;  I wounder if this lady considers later in life how her children<br/>

find out why they don&#39;t want to go never crossed her mind.<br/>

Philadelphia Recruits and Trains Parents as Truant Officers<br/>
By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
HILADELPHIA, Jan. 29 ï¿½ In an effort to corral thousands of <br/>
class-cutting<br/>
students, the Philadelphia school district hired 250 truant officers <br/>
late<br/>
last year.<br/>
Among its hiring criteria for the job, one element loomed most <br/>
important:<br/>
the district specifically recruited parents.<br/>
&quot;Parents know the terrain, know the environment, understand the culture<br/>
and may even know some of the individual parents and kids,&quot; said Paul<br/>
Vallas, chief executive of the 200,000-student school system.<br/>
Truancy is a big concern in Philadelphia. On any given day, more than<br/>
12,000 Philadelphia students, or 6.4 percent, are absent without an<br/>
excuse.<br/>
The problem worries school officials because truants are more likely to<br/>
use drugs, join gangs, commit crimes or drop out.<br/>
&quot;Truancy is our first best flag that a kid will enter the juvenile<br/>
justice system,&quot; said Ken Seeley, who is studying the effectiveness of<br/>
seven truancy reduction programs for the Justice Department.<br/>
Mr. Vallas hired 600 parents for a similar program in Chicago, where he<br/>
headed the school system for six years. He said the program cut truancy<br/>
to 3.9 percent from 5.7 percent.<br/>
Philadelphia contracted with 12 community and religious organizations <br/>
to<br/>
hire and train parent-truant officers. The training began last month; <br/>
so<br/>
far, 166 parents have gone through the program and started visiting the<br/>
homes of truants. The officers are paid $9 an hour for at least 10 <br/>
hours<br/>
a week.<br/>
&quot;The primary role is to inform parents that their child has been <br/>
truant,<br/>
that resources are available, that we are ready to help,&quot; said Vern<br/>
Trent, who heads the program.<br/>
While it is too soon to tell whether the $1.2 million program is <br/>
working,<br/>
the officers had more than 1,600 contacts with parents through Dec. 31.<br/>
Some parents are unaware that their children are cutting class. Others<br/>
cannot afford clothes or bus tokens. Others are on drugs or alcohol.<br/>
Hastings Coach, who heads the parent-truant officer program for the<br/>
Women&#39;s Association for Women&#39;s Alternatives, a social services agency,<br/>
said officers were told to be supportive and understanding, not<br/>
threatening.<br/>
&quot;Any time you&#39;re in someone&#39;s home, you&#39;re a guest and you have to<br/>
conduct yourself accordingly. You&#39;re not some authority with a stiff<br/>
hand. You want to be invited back,&quot; Mr. Coach said.<br/>
But officers also explain that chronic absenteeism could land both<br/>
students and their parents in the truancy court, with the possibility <br/>
of<br/>
fines, community service and even jail for the adults and transfer to <br/>
an<br/>
alternative school for the pupils.<br/>
That is smart, Mr. Seeley said, because any successful <br/>
truancy-reduction<br/>
program needs to have both carrots and sticks. In Jacksonville, Fla., <br/>
one<br/>
of the programs he is studying, more than 100 parents have been <br/>
arrested<br/>
for failing to send their children to school.<br/>
Jennifer Jones, 42, whose children are 6, 16 and 19, said <br/>
Philadelphia&#39;s<br/>
truancy program was a natural fit for her. Her house is a magnet for<br/>
neighborhood children; she has been known to break up fistfights; even<br/>
before she became a truant officer, she confronted truants and ordered<br/>
them to go back to school.<br/>
And because her own children are sometimes less than enthusiastic about<br/>
school, she understands how some parents have trouble making sure <br/>
theirs<br/>
go to class.<br/>
&quot;I think people feel more comfortable dealing with another parent,&quot; Ms.<br/>
Jones said. &quot;Parents know what kids are capable of, how their minds<br/>
work.&quot;<br/>
