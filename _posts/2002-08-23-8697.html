&gt; Any ideas as to a good response I can send?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Response? Nothing polite comes to mind. Maybe a suggestion that what they do <br/>
isn&#39;t unschooling AT ALL, and is really traditional school-at-home. That they <br/>
shouldn&#39;t dress their wolf in sheep&#39;s clothing and call it chocolate cause <br/>
their &quot;accelerated&quot; kids probably know the difference anyway. The kid I <br/>
really feel bad for is the ungifted, adopted one. Geeze what a witch! To <br/>
remind a child every day that not only is he dumb (I know she doesn&#39;t say <br/>
that, but she sure implies it!) but not her real kid either. <br/>
Maybe you could compile all of the lists responses into an email, with a <br/>
short explanation that you shared what she wrote with others who were curious <br/>
too. And a big PS telling her... never mind, that wasn&#39;t nice either. <br/>
