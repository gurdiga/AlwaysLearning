<div id="ygrps-yiv-1433413782">&quot;Good for you for telling him the rules about alcohol.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Some rules are stupid. How does a person that has something forbidden<br/>
from them until they&#39;re 21, learn how to be responsible about the<br/>
forbidden thing? Whenever we&#39;re drinking wine or beer, we&#39;ve let our<br/>
kids have a sip. By the time their teenagers, you better have an open<br/>
relationship, not one filled with fear and rules or you just won&#39;t<br/>
know about their habits.<br/>
<br/>
In Europe, it&#39;s quite normal to give children beer or wine with meals.<br/>
I don&#39;t think forbidding it until 21 keeps people from drinking it,<br/>
just makes some things more secretive. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s great to share information openly. Children are more likely to<br/>
listen if you aren&#39;t making a big deal about it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1239083253"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I dont think you were wrong at all for telling your son that he needs to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>wait til he&#39;s 21. God forbid he drinks as a teen and gets behind the wheel<br/>
of a car and kills someone, or himself.<br/>
<br/>
**Telling someone they &#39;need&#39; to wait til they&#39;re 21 doesn&#39;t guarantee that<br/>
they&#39;ll wait til they&#39;re 21.  It could possibly close a door of<br/>
communication, though, causing a teenager to hide that he&#39;s drinking and<br/>
lessening the chance that he&#39;d call home when he needed a ride because he or<br/>
his friend/driver had been drinking.<br/>
<br/>
And, of course, many drunk drivers are over 21.<br/>

parents are permitted to allow their children alcohol in certain locations.<br/>
