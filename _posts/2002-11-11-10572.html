 </span></blockquote>The boy has a color gameboy and I&#39;d recommend it if you can find one fairly <br/>
cheaply.  The color gameboy can play any of the monochromatic games, but <br/>
I&#39;m not sure it works the other way around.  Maybe someone out there <br/>
knows.  The different color cases on the gameboys don&#39;t mean anything <br/>
except that the person who bought it likes blue, or red or yellow, or <br/>
whatever color the best.  It&#39;s like a color on a car.<br/>
<br/>
Some games need extra memory, but most don&#39;t.  Check out the bionicle game <br/>
the next time you&#39;re in target/wherever and see if the packaging says it&#39;ll <br/>
need extra.  Its the best way to tell.  the boy sometimes likes his &#39;light&#39; <br/>
that attaches to the gameboy and lights up the screen so he can play when <br/>
it&#39;s dark.  His game came with an &#39;accessory pack&#39; package and that&#39;s about <br/>
the only thing he uses from the pack.<br/>
<br/>
My boy LOVES his gameboy and won&#39;t go on a long car trip without it.  We <br/>
frequently get him a new game when we start out on *really* long trips <br/>
(usually of more than 10 hours).  He would not do well having to share it, <br/>
because the minute he sees someone else playing one, he wants to play <br/>
his.  That might be unique to my boy, though.<br/>

Also, do they have games for little ones? I am guessing that if Jason has one, Kyle <br/>
will want one (he will be 3 in Feb). Not sure if it makes sense to get one for Kyle<br/>
yet though....<br/>
<br/>
Any and all advice would be appreciated!<br/>

I don&#39;t know about games for little guys; sorry.  But you can play any <br/>
Gameboy games ever made on the, original, or color, or Advance.  So buying <br/>
used games might be a thing to do.  (In addition to whatever cool spiff NEW <br/>
game(s).<br/>

that screen can be hard to see, and a case, and do get extra batteries<br/>
for the Gameboy and the light, they tend to die right in the middle of<br/>
things.  <br/>
<br/>
You can play all the other Gameboy games on an Advance.  They are great<br/>
if you&#39;re in the car or waiting somewhere.  <br/>

Not applicable for game boy advance, says Holly, who&#39;s had one since the day <br/>
they came out and knows these things.<br/>

Holly says no.  Games for either newer system won&#39;t play on an original <br/>
gameboy.  The cartridges are different.  But they&#39;ll all go into the Advance.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1708459990">I have a 6 yr old with a Gameboy.  She loves it.  Her favorite game is Crash Bandicoot.  My 9 yr old has the Bionicle game and seems to like it.  He also likes Crash and Zelda.  <br/>
<br/>
You can look on the Nintendo site and there may be a few games rated for Early Learning, or something like that.  I doubt that the 3 yr old will be able to play because most take some reading and boys that little won&#39;t have developed enough hand/eye coordination.  Plus his hands may be too small.  You might get him a toy with buttons and pictures that resembles a Gameboy.  I think I saw something in a catalog that looks like a personal messenger or something (?)<br/>
