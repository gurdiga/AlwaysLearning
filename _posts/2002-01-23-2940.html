<div id="ygrps-yiv-707106175">I&#39;m sorry, everyone.  I didn&#39;t mean to stir anything up and should have<br/>
thought for a minute before I  posted about the pro-life marchers.<br/>
We all stand where we stand on this issue.  <br/>
I was commenting more on the place of the &quot;protest&quot; really.  I have a<br/>
friend who was a doctor here for twelve years and in that time never saw<br/>
one woman seeking abortion.   That is not to say no one from this town<br/>
would, only that they are all too aware of the prevailing attitude and<br/>
would have gone somewhere else.  <br/>
Sorry, <br/>
Deb L</div>
