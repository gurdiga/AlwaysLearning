<div id="ygrps-yiv-1062787369">my middle son (7) is cautious.  Often resistent to try new things, often fearful that he will not be able to do it or that others are better.  sometimes he will do things once or twice but something will happen, usually unspoken or unnoticed by me, and he wont do it anymore. i think sometimes its just a feeling he gets. if he sees an activity as something &quot;belonging&quot; to another family member he wont try.  he limits so much of what he does and i want to help him try more things. <br/>
help him understand that it ok not to do everything well right away.<br/>
do i just accept this is him at this time and offer opportunities to do other things?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-107824740">It may be him always... it may be who he is and how he interfaces with new<br/>
stuff, his personal style of getting to know things. Karl does some of this<br/>
sometimes, or a lot of the time. I&#39;ve noticed that he&#39;s big on observing for<br/>
LONG periods. Once he figures he can do it perfectly he will try it and if<br/>
something seems wrong or messed up he backs up from it, either permanently?<br/>
and may lose interest altogether or for a longer period of observing others.<br/>
I thought he&#39;d like to do aikido and as long as he&#39;s absolutely SURE no one<br/>
will even *suggest* that he try it, he was happy with the thought of going<br/>
just to see what they do. But other people don&#39;t know this about him and<br/>
even one of the other kid&#39;s parents who were there seemed intent on<br/>
convincing Karl to try it out for himself and assured him he would love it<br/>
once he got into it (?? a perfect stranger was *sure* Karl would like it).<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s very much one to want me to come with him to do just about anything new<br/>
or with people he doesn&#39;t know and so on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1047303295">I do a lot of work with school kids in the outdoors, and it is common to<br/>
find children who fear that they may not have the capacity to do the<br/>
unfamiliar things, or that they will fail. Particularly when teachers come<br/>
along. It is an outdoor group setting, but I imagine the principle would<br/>
work indoors with two people too.<br/>
<br/>
I begin the programme with deceptively simple activities, which &#39;seduce&#39;<br/>
kids into involvement because they are great fun, and seem very easy. It is<br/>
only as they immerse themselves in the activity, that they discover that it<br/>
is not as easy as it seems, but by then, they are so &#39;hooked&#39; that they have<br/>
no time to worry about if they can do it or not. Of course, I try to keep<br/>
the task achievable in the natural flow of the game.<br/>
<br/>
Later, during the discussions, we talk about perceptions. how it was in the<br/>
beginning, how it unfolded, how it concluded, and how much work compared<br/>
with what they had imagined going in it turned out to be. I conveniently<br/>
&#39;forget&#39; to talk about success and failure unless one of the kids brings it<br/>
up. If they do, I make time to explore ways of measuring success like,<br/>
personal bench marks, consistent improvement, enjoyment, etc. In addition to<br/>
the accepted &#39;completion of task&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
A few games that are easy with emerging difficulties later, I throw in one<br/>
that seems tough, but turns out doable. One day of this kind of stuff, and<br/>
the kids are ready to bite into anything thrown at them.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have experience spending days at home with kids, so I don&#39;t know the<br/>
exact activity you could do, but it shouldn&#39;t be rocket science - cards,<br/>
castles with sand or scrabble could work. Group discussions could be<br/>
replaced by informal conversations.<br/>
<br/>
This works so well, that it has almost become a permanent feature of my<br/>
programme designs. It opens up the whole bunch of them. You could measure<br/>
change in decibels.<br/>
<br/>
If you do try this, let me know about your experience, because I haven&#39;t<br/>
done this in other settings. it would help me understand too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-827230884">i forgot. One of my favourites for this is blowing soap bubbles. Its great<br/>
fun, and possible at home. I begin with the guaranteed soap bubbles, and<br/>
then make it about how big we can make them, give them some raw materials<br/>
for tools to make bigger bubbles, etc.<br/>
<br/>
It quickly gets tougher and tougher, but never stops being fun or tires them<br/>
too badly to fuzzy their self-awareness. No matter where you end, as long as<br/>
the last bubble is a success, you&#39;ve ended on a &#39;win&#39; note.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1526030429">---One of my favourites for this is blowing soap bubbles.---<br/>
 <br/>
We had a box fan set up outside one summer and my son and his cousins were playing with soap bubbles. One of the bubble wands in the set was 12&quot; or 14&quot; round with lots of holes in it, so that you could wave it through the air and make lots and lots of small bubbles. They loaded it up with soap and put it in front of the (turned one) box fan and, holy smoke, you would not believe how many bubbles that generated!! Not sure if I would&#39;ve thought to do that myself, so I&#39;m glad they did -- it&#39;s still one of my favorite summertime memories.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-190170707">Oops. I forgot about the machines. They are an absolute storm of bubbles.<br/>
Good fun. For the activity, I provide &#39;raw material&#39; like soap solution and<br/>
flexible wire, string, other odds and ends lying around...<br/>
<br/>
I know Glenda didn&#39;t mean it for the activity, just realized that is is a<br/>
difference in what may be available at home and in basic camp life. So I<br/>
thought I&#39;d clarify the equipment I usually use.<br/>
