<div id="ygrps-yiv-1888954738">I&#39;ve tried twice to put photos on and no luck. I get through the whole <br/>
process and hit upload and the little blue line zips across and then nothing. <br/>
I&#39;m sure I did everything right and that is usually my first mistake. &lt;g&gt; So <br/>
if someone wants to give me a few pointers, that would be wonderful!<br/>

more than eight characters with any punctuation marks in the middle? <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m glad you like it. We did it ourselves. Clamped the camera to the fascia<br/>
board of the roof outside the kitchen door. Used a step ladder to push the<br/>
self timer, scampered down for the snap. I got some amusing very close ups<br/>
when I pushed the wrong button. That side of the house was in full shadow<br/>
around noon, so we were lit with nothing but soft, even, sky light on a<br/>
slightly overcast day. I took out the background with photoshop.<br/>
