<div id="ygrps-yiv-142391027">Never asked a question or voiced a concern on this list but here goes. <br/>
<br/>
I have 4 kids ages 13,11,8 & 3. I&#39;ve been unschooling since the older three were 9,7 & 5. Maybe earlier than that really but I found a name for what we did when they were around those ages. Anyway, for the most part we just live our lives and really enjoy each others company. My oldest, in fact, was just having a conversation with her brothers about the three of them renting a house together when they move out. They like being with each other. <br/>
<br/>
Okay here is my concern. My boys ages 11 & 8 have no desire to do any formal math curriculum. I am thinking this is okay and that when they find a need for formal math (even if that&#39;s not until they are 16) they will be able to learn it more quickly at that time than if I tried to teach it to them now. Is this naive? I just have moments of panic every now and then. Sometimes we just love our lives so much it almost seems like I&#39;m not doing something right. Like there should be more struggle. I mean my kids are hardly ever in trouble, they don&#39;t get things taken away from them, we generally don&#39;t argue etc. It&#39;s not perfect by any means and we have our moments but the overall feel of our home is relaxed fun. <br/>
<br/>
Again, I sometimes feel that we are having too much fun and that I am robbing them of stronger academics. <br/>
<br/>
I welcome any feedback especially from moms with grown kids. That always gives me some sense of reassurance. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your time,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I would say you&#39;re not naive if there&#39;s a need for math in their lives.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s essential for unschooling for people to grasp how kids absorb  <br/>
and puzzle out how the world works by doing, living, and using. For  <br/>
instance, kids don&#39;t need reading programs. They need pleasant  <br/>
experiences with the written word, someone who will answer their  <br/>
questions, a personally meaningful need to get something by reading  <br/>
and they will get reading when they&#39;re developmentally ready.<br/>
<br/>
The one thing that concerns me is that so many people have been  <br/>
damaged by school math that they&#39;re happy to be free of math. Kids  <br/>
will have a harder time getting pleasant experiences with math if  <br/>
their parents are gleefully avoiding numbers because there&#39;s no one  <br/>
to make them do calculations anymore. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
There will be quite a bit of math in their lives if kids have an  <br/>
allowance and play video games. :-) But it will be helpful to have  <br/>
measuring tools as handy as crayons: rulers, tape measures, stop  <br/>
watch, nested measuring cups (they make great bath toys :-). Even  <br/>
better will be parents who don&#39;t avoid measuring and counting and  <br/>
comparing because of bad flashbacks from school. Numbers should be as  <br/>
natural a part of life as words.<br/>
<br/>
(And measuring needn&#39;t be done with a ruler. It can be done with a  <br/>
string or the thing itself. Probably for kids who build things with  <br/>
Legos, it&#39;s natural to measure in bricks.)<br/>
<br/>
It will be good to have board and card games (and parents who enjoy  <br/>
playing them). Sports. Collections to sort in various ways. (It can  <br/>
be rocks picked up on walks, plastic dinosaurs, model cars, leaves,  <br/>
pencils, Beanies, Pokemon ...) Maps. Google Maps (which will  <br/>
incorporate mileage.) Spreadsheets for recording collections. (I  <br/>
helped Kathryn set up several databases for Pokemon so she could keep  <br/>
track of various things.) Figuring out how long until some event.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a good page about math:<br/>
<br/>
A few words about unschooling math by Luz Shoshie<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/math/luz">http://sandradodd.com/math/luz</a><br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s *not* meant as a curriculum! It&#39;s meant as a way to notice how  <br/>
math is all around us. You may not know half the things and that&#39;s  <br/>
okay. Some of these things (or things like them such as a variety of  <br/>
games) should be part of your life. Some of the words it will help to  <br/>
think about how they&#39;re part of life that you may not have thought of  <br/>
as math (like yardage is in football, sewing and gardening.)<br/>

I hope that doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re doing formal teaching about other  <br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not naive to think that they can learn without being taught.   <br/>
It&#39;s called &quot;unschooling.&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The guilt about having fun is normal, too.<br/>
<br/>
I think you should read about the value of play and joy so you can  <br/>
free up the time and energy you&#39;re using now with worry and fear.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1887742732">I think it&#39;s a lot easier for unschooling parents who stay at home to have<br/>
the opportunity to notice a lot of learning that&#39;s taking place that&#39;s not<br/>
right on the surface where anyone walking by could see it. Parents who work<br/>
away from home usually want more obvious signs and so do others who don&#39;t<br/>
live with the children in their day to day lives. It&#39;s easy to wonder how<br/>
your lives must look to others and to want reassurance.<br/>
<br/>
So for me, how that translates is to pay closer attention, and since some of<br/>
us (me) don&#39;t naturally do that, it means at least doing for a short while.<br/>
Taking note of how Karl is learning something about telling time from not<br/>
only the clocks around the house but also the watch he wanted me to get to<br/>
replace the one that broke because it was cheap and not well made even if it<br/>
was cute. It&#39;s digital and easier to figure time concepts from than having<br/>
to figure out the whole analog deal.  On a meta level it means me getting<br/>
friendlier with numbers now that I&#39;m *not* in school, like Joyce says. I&#39;ve<br/>
tried to be (because it&#39;s expected of school kids) as analytical and<br/>
abstract as I can in the past. Now I realize the value of appreciating my<br/>
own ways of learning about the world ... which is very tactile and visual,<br/>
and I have found ways to play with the concepts that numbers are visually<br/>
and yes.. legos is a great way to do that for Karl. He actually calls the<br/>
piece he&#39;s looking for by the number of interlocking bumps he sees, and<br/>
we&#39;ll look for another one in the color he wants.<br/>
<br/>
I purposely picked small things to notice. Karl doesn&#39;t often mention what<br/>
he notices about time or ask questions but he does sometimes. He doesn&#39;t<br/>
play with legos all day long usually. But when he does play with numbers I<br/>
know he is getting a lot out of it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My youngest daughter, who is now 19 years old, just said the other day that she thought she might get a college minor in math or maybe even double major in math (and Deaf Studies - interpreting, which is what she&#39;s most focused on). <br/>
<br/>
She did NO formal math until she was a college student. Absolutely none. <br/>
<br/>
She did play LOTS of games - really a lot of playing of all kinds of games, including a lot of Dungeons and Dragons and a lot of Magic, the Gathering, and a lot of Munchkin and lots and lots of board games, card games, word games, etc. <br/>
<br/>
When she was 17 years old she took a basic math class at the community college. I started with arithmetic - adding,subtracting, multiplying, dividing, fractions, decimals, percentages. Then she took the next level - more arithmetic and some basic geometry like finding perimeters and areas and volumes and a little work with angles. Then she took the next level, pre-algebra (which is really more arithmetic, but includes a lot of work with exponents, including fractional exponents, and some trigonometry. Then college-level algebra. Now she&#39;s taking calculus and loves it - really looks forward to it. <br/>
<br/>
Because I have a lot of math background, myself, it has always been easy for me to see that she had a knack for mathematical thinking and for me to see her developing it IN the games she played and the way she approached all kinds of things - from pretend play when she was little, to fashion when she was a teenager. <br/>
<br/>
She may not pursue formal math any farther, or maybe she will. She has a lot of other interests, too. <br/>
<br/>
Her 22 year old sister also had no formal math until college. She also took a series of math classes in college, starting from basic arithmetic. She didn&#39;t find them difficult at ALL. She liked them somewhat - didn&#39;t revel in enjoyment of them or anything, but didn&#39;t detest them the way most of the other students seemed to do. She got good grades and understood the material and was very comfortable with the classes. The last class she took was a statistics and probability class from a truly ridiculously horrible teacher, and she didn&#39;t enjoy it at all, but got herself through it because it fulfilled her last math requirement for graduation. I doubt she&#39;ll take any more formal math classes, she&#39;s majoring in Drama and History. But she wouldn&#39;t be afraid to do so, if there was a reason.<br/>
<br/>
My 25 year old daughter took the same route as the other two - same experience with college math. She graduated with a degree in Recreation and Leisure Studies and has a great job as coordinator of a program for adults with developmental disabilities. She went to school through 4th grade, so I can&#39;t say she never had any math lessons, because she did have in school. But I cannot see that she experienced formal or higher-level math in any way differently than the other two. Luckily, she&#39;d been in a kind of experimental school and never had a math test - their math had been taught in a very gentle way, mostly through (assigned) games. So she came out of it undamaged and without any residual math anxiety.Things were different in education in those days of &quot;whole language,&quot; &quot;integrated curriculum,&quot; &quot;authentic assessment,&quot; and no textbooks or tests or grades. It was before the standardized testing craze started. <br/>
<br/>
So - yes, I can assure you that it is certainly possible for kids to do no formal math, to play all the time, to have a good and fun life, and still, if they choose to do so, go on and study formal math successfully.<br/>
<br/>
The one thing that all three of my kids have commented on about their college math classes has been that the other students would do better if they&#39;d try to understand why things work the way they do instead of being focused on memorizing how to do things. They have complained about and resented it whenever they had teachers who wouldn&#39;t explain concepts and just expected them to memorize how to perform some kind of manipulation of numbers without fully understanding what they were doing.<br/>

It will help if you know if you keep your direction in mind and make  <br/>
choices that move toward that rather than away from it.  That sounds  <br/>
too obvious to state, maybe, but it&#39;s common for people to wander this  <br/>

My daughter is 16 and has attended our local high school for choir and art the last three years, as well as taken several classes at the university...last year (sophmore) the students took the PLAN test, a practice ACT...she decided to take it for the experience, and did very well...not surprised that math was a little low,... but she has been receiving all sorts of literature from schools because of her scores...that was with out any studying or preparing at all. </span></blockquote></div>

Wishing you&#39;d been a good math teacher isn&#39;t a step toward successful  <br/>
unschooling, though.  I can&#39;t tell if you were joking, but as others  <br/>
won&#39;t know either, accepting that things can and should be learned  <br/>
when there&#39;s a real need or when something comes up that just  happens  <br/>
to cause it to make sense is what unschooling&#39;s all about.   Move the  <br/>
other direction from &quot;oh wells&quot; and concerns!<br/>

So of course it didn&#39;t take as well as it might have (oh well ... now to<br/>
change that thought pattern).<br/>
<br/>
Karl is 6, has always been very vocal (which was helpful to me for sure) and<br/>
has been inclined to play with numbers since he was just a little guy,<br/>
barely 3 years old. He has only increased in his interest in this area as<br/>
time goes by. I don&#39;t want to be behind the eight ball trying to explain<br/>
what I don&#39;t understand, so I took it upon myself to learn more about how<br/>
basic number concepts work in case Karl asks me more of those kinds of<br/>
questions. (I&#39;m sure he will.) He doesn&#39;t want to memorize number facts. He<br/>
wants to know how they work and that&#39;s a very different kind of info. I<br/>
joined a great yahoo group where there was some good discussion. I thought<br/>
the owner of the group was very helpful. The group looks really kind of<br/>
inactive now but there&#39;s a lot of good stuff in the archives and if the<br/>
owner is still around I&#39;m sure questions would be welcome:<br/>

Don&#39;t think of it as just &quot;numbers,&quot; though (my kids did that too, so  <br/>
I&#39;m no knocking playing with numbers).  Maybe get a geoboard and some  <br/>
rubber bands and don&#39;t talk about numbers.  Look for mathematical and  <br/>
pattern and comparisons and ratio things that don&#39;t involve &quot;numbers&quot;  <br/>
at all, because that&#39;s something school can tend to ignore completely  <br/>
and many parents think all math involves numbers themselves--numerals.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of going away from unschooling to a math source, maybe look at  <br/>
the stuff by Linda Wyatt and Pam Sorooshian and others who are  <br/>
unschoolers:<br/>

Even while learning more about math, unschooling parents can be  <br/>
learning more about unschooling and the interconnectedness of things.<br/>

To me, numbers have to do with patterns.  Margaux is really into patterns of all kinds, so numbers come into it a lot.  Chamille on the other hand has never seen things in that way.  Last night, though, she figured out how to make a glove 3-D, and then sewed it together.  It&#39;s spacial awareness, not number related, but I feel, very mathematical!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Rosie was like that - very spatially aware. She likes to color in coloring<br/>
books. When she was little and liked that, I thought it was too bad that she<br/>
wasn&#39;t more into being creative - I thought drawing her own pictures was<br/>
&quot;superior&quot; to coloring in coloring books. Looking back, I realize that she<br/>
was playing around with the lines in the coloring book - using color to<br/>
create shapes from the lines. It was very mathematical for her - still is -<br/>
she&#39;s 19 and sometimes buys herself a Dover coloring book and still loves<br/>
her prismacolor colored pencils.  She has got an awareness of line and shape<br/>
and space that is serving her well in a college calculus class. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Kids really and truly do not need to be doing things that look like math to<br/>
us school-damaged parents. We are damaged, imo, when we can&#39;t see the value<br/>
in what our kids are choosing to do because it doesn&#39;t appear to us to be<br/>
contributing to learning something recognizable to us. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So - now - some people reading this will probably go buy their kids coloring<br/>
books in hopes that will turn them into good math students someday in the<br/>
future, right? &lt;G&gt;  But, notice it didn&#39;t matter at ALL whether I recognized<br/>
what Rosie was doing as building &quot;math skills.&quot; All that mattered was I<br/>
supplied her with what she enjoyed. I was always on the lookout for cool<br/>
coloring books. And she went through phases with them - some were simple,<br/>
but as she got older she liked the more sophisticated ones - historical ones<br/>
and fashion through the ages, etc. She also did some of the Bellerophon<br/>
coloring books, but never liked them as much as the Dovers, even though they<br/>
appear more complex, I think because the lines are less defined, they are<br/>
more sketchy and have more open-ended space in them. For a while she did the<br/>
coloring books that were just patterns - the geometrical ones - but usually<br/>
she liked the Dover ones with people or the really beautiful nature ones -<br/>
Roses, Butterflies, etc. She colored in all the pictures in the same<br/>
coloring books multiple times - I bought duplicates of the ones she liked<br/>
the most, multiple times. <br/>

So why do it?<br/>
Either it&#39;s worthless or it&#39;s used for something (like &quot;nuancing&quot; a  <br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s money involved, and in a case in which the kids don&#39;t know  <br/>
their scores, the school&#39;s averages can still affect their funding.<br/>
<br/>
True, it has nothing to do with unschooling.  Some kids, even if they  <br/>
don&#39;t know the scores, will stress out and be unwell.  There&#39;s rarely  <br/>
any benefit to an individual child, and often much wear and tear (if  <br/>
not downright harm).<br/>

I could be wrong about this, but it seems to me that just wording it  <br/>
slightly differently could help with the feeling of doom (for the  <br/>
parents).<br/>
<br/>
In Minnesota, the law currently requires annual testing.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;have to&quot; comes in the parents deciding to comply with that law.    <br/>
I comply with most laws very carefully.  Our yard is all legal.  I put  <br/>
the recycling out exactly to specs (beyond and better; I wash mine  <br/>
&lt;g&gt;).  Our cars are registered and insured, even my deceased brother- <br/>
in-law&#39;s old Chevy pickup we don&#39;t even use.<br/>
<br/>
Choosing to follow a rule is still a choice.  &quot;Have to&quot; is a fearful  <br/>
burden.<br/>

<br/>
Absolutely. You are right. I don&#39;t have a feeling of doom but I have learned here how<br/>
changing how we word things differently can make a big difference and how we feel about them.<br/>
I should have known better than to say &quot; I have&quot; to because as I said  in that post I could<br/>
have always chose to not register or do something else!<br/>
I did chose to register and for my son to do the test.<br/>
No big deal. <br/>
I can see how saying &quot;I have to&quot; will not help one see the choices around them.<br/>
<br/>
So I stand corrected: I chose to get my son tested. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
