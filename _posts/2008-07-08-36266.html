&lt;&lt;&lt;I started giving my kids definitions of words that they  asked the meanings<br/>
of, from my own understanding, then I would look it up  and see how it<br/>
compared and give them the dictionary definition as  well.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I do that, too. Though, often, my definition in my terms, my &quot;wordiness&quot; is  <br/>
too much for my son&#39;s comprehension. If I can go to the dictionary and see the <br/>
 definition spelled out in front of me, I am much more able to substitute <br/>
simpler  words into their definitions and he can understand what I&#39;m trying to <br/>
get  across. Although, when I run across one of my pet peeves, it makes it more  <br/>
frustrating than enjoyable. My biggest dictionary pet peeve is using a part <br/>
of  the word in the definition, i.e.: frustration: the state of being <br/>
frustrated.  Ergh!!!<br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>

<br/>
But for forms of a verb, they shouldn&#39;t need to define them anyway. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If &quot;frustrate&quot; is defined well, all its forms should be clear.<br/>
