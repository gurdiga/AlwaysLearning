Betsy I thought that was a great idea about checking with the library so<br/>
I called our local library and asked them why 25 and what if we were<br/>
school teachers or homeschoolers.  He said that it&#39;s 25 but they do go<br/>
over sometimes and school teachers are not treated any differently.  He<br/>
said the best thing to do is to get a card for each person in the family<br/>
and that way (he asked how many there were of us) we could take out 100<br/>
books at a time.  As I said to him &quot;and I think it would be me that<br/>
would have to lug 100 books back to the car (LOL).... They have been<br/>
known to let me check out more than 25 but they usually remind me that I<br/>
have over 25 and if I could bring some back that would be helpful.<br/>

Hi, Heather --<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how &quot;suggestable&quot; your librarians are, but I&#39;ve used a<br/>
library system where &quot;educators&quot; could check out larger numbers of books<br/>
with longer renewal privileges.  I wonder if you could get your<br/>
librarians to create a policy loophole like that? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I want to kick myself for suggesting that some people should get more<br/>
privileges at the library than others, but it seems to me that you need<br/>
a higher limit.  (Or need to get more cards for the youngest kids.  But<br/>
then you&#39;d probably need a shopping cart to get all the books home.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1148066519">Speaking of Nanini... I made the mistake of asking about homeschool<br/>
programs there to the co-ordinator. She told me all about their<br/>
afternoon teen program and how it was perfect for homeschoolers. Even<br/>
though it had nothing to do with homeschoolers. ;)<br/>
<br/>
I plastered a smile on my face and started backing slowly away...<br/>
<br/>
So far about fifty books is all I can handle taking out, more than<br/>
that and they just sit around. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll post some recent good picks for videos and reference, that is<br/>
after I renew &#39;em! ;)<br/>

We just moved and the new library doesn&#39;t have quite as large a<br/>
collection, but it&#39;s open on Sundays, which I consider a terrific<br/>
luxury, since going to the library *by myself* is my idea of wild fun. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-191056150">Our 2 previous libraries (before we moved) had 6 week due dates for books <br/>
for teachers and homeschoolers.  I don&#39;t know if there was any limit on the <br/>
number.  One library had a wonderful service:  You told them the subject <br/>
matter, age/grade levels desired and what kind of materials.  The subject <br/>
matter was whatever the kids&#39; current interest was.  The next week, we could <br/>
go pick up the boxed materials.<br/>
It sure saved me time.  Of course, the kids would still go around finding <br/>
more library materials.<br/>

Zimmerman.  (Used to be able to, anyway.)<br/>

Yes, but the tend to have about the same books.  If your branch&#39;s copy is <br/>
checked out I guess maybe they&#39;ll request the other branch&#39;s copy for you.  <br/>
But I think generally they expect you to drive over there and get it and then <br/>

We might have to look into that.<br/>

<br/>
My thoughts exactly.  Springfield has probably half the number of branches<br/>
but much more selection.  They&#39;ve recently taken to buying large<br/>
superstores (old home depot is their latest) and turning them into<br/>
enormous library complexes.  But I can&#39;t complain too much.  I have to<br/>
drive over an hour to get from our home in Missouri to Springfield.  Our<br/>
hometown library is a little bigger than our apartment - I&#39;m only slightly<br/>
exaggerating.  They have so few books that they have to limit everyone to<br/>
a maximum of four books per card.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; Interlibrary loan?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, that works pretty well when you know what you want.  I find more<br/>
just by browsing these days, though.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I use Title Wave and Page One Too more than I use the library.<br/>
<br/>
Good thinking.  I just got into bookcrossing.com recently and I love the<br/>
idea of just leaving books around for people.  Buying them cheaply could<br/>
make it that much easier to just leave them behind.<br/>

Exactly.  But what I&#39;ve found is that if the book I want isn&#39;t there and I<br/>
put a hold on it and set the pickup location to my local branch then it&#39;s<br/>
there waiting for me in a couple of days.<br/>

<br/>
I definitely appreciate the amount of greenspace (brownspace?) here and<br/>
the prevalence of pedestrian/bike trails as well.  I can&#39;t imagine riding<br/>
a bike on the road in this city.  It seems the drivers here are<br/>
particularly dangerous.<br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s a limit on our cards anyway of 50 for the adults and 25 for<br/>
children.  That gives us a limit of 125, though, which is fine by me.<br/>

much the same as all the others.  But when I look up a book (or tape or<br/>
video or CD or CDRom) it will show in one or more branches.  I then put a<br/>
hold on it, right from home, and get a call when it&#39;s in my branch to pick<br/>
up.  I love ordering online.  It&#39;s like ordering from catalogs, but for<br/>
free.  If I&#39;m looking up a subject, invariably there are a bunch more that<br/>
I&#39;ll want, and I order them too.  I pick up anywhere from 2-10 items every<br/>
week when I go in.<br/>
