<div id="ygrps-yiv-305397368">Whoops!<br/>
<br/>
Pam, I was surprised to see your response that NC does not have many <br/>
requirements.  When I moved to NC I was upset to learn about the <br/>
standardized test requirement.  I know it is really easy to do it <br/>
with no grade level requirement or minimum scoring or reporting, but <br/>
I don&#39;t want to subject my kids to the testing at all.  <br/>
<br/>
Do you have any info re: the possible consequences for not filing a <br/>
Notice of Intent to homeschool & if you do notify, what if you fail <br/>
to test?  <br/>
<br/>
It is my understanding that you only have to keep records for one <br/>
year, so I guess you could just file your Notice of Intent & then if <br/>
you are ever notified that the gov&#39;t wants to review your records you <br/>
could have your child take the test at that point.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your input. Kat.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Hey Kat I did reply to your post on the NCunschoolers list but will make a <br/>
quick response here.<br/>
If you do not file a notice of intent then you are not a homschooler.  You <br/>
are considered a truant public schooler.  That is how they will look at it if <br/>
anyone ever decided to question you or the school (thinking of neighbors here).<br/>
<br/>
For us we use the Children&#39;s skills test which is a computer type of test set <br/>
up like a game.  My boy stake the grade they want and that is easy since they <br/>
have no concept of grade level at all.  It is very low key, my boys hate <br/>
anything timed, but this is easy for them since they know the results mean <br/>
nothing.  I print it, don&#39;t look at it and file it away.  No big deal here.<br/>
 <br/>
But yes, the state does have to give you notice if they were ever to come <br/>
visit and this test is all at home so you could do it in a day.  There are some <br/>
that require you to send away for the results.  <br/>
<br/>
Not sure if there are any consequences to not testing and proclaiming so.  <br/>
<br/>
But I do not know anyone that has been visited.  Not one person.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-215930793">I just sent in my letter of intent to NC.  Another homeschooling friend here <br/>
told me that she got a letter this year that said she could choose to send in <br/>
her attendance records and test scores or her chances of getting a visit would <br/>
increase.<br/>
<br/>
One of her friends said she deals with this by saying she will send the info, <br/>
then never does.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know about this?  I&#39;m all for doing the least the law requires, <br/>
but don&#39;t want a home visit.  My friend is very concerned and considering <br/>
sending in the paperwork.<br/>

I don&#39;t understand the point. If there is no grade level requirement, then <br/>
you could just have your kids take the lowest grade level offered. If there is <br/>
no minimum scoring then it doesn&#39;t matter what test level kids take. And if you <br/>
don&#39;t have to report the scores then isn&#39;t that just a waste of a tree? (Not <br/>
that it isn&#39;t already) Where is the logic?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1729105134">Nancy, your response, &quot;What&#39;s the point&quot; re: the NC testing requirement is<br/>
the exact reason I am questioning it, but also the reason so many people<br/>
just comply.  If we start telling the &quot;officials&quot; that their testing<br/>
requirement is useless, they might try to add some teeth to it.  In a way, I<br/>
may have just answered my own question.  I really hate asking my children to<br/>
take a test like that.  Who knows, it might be a non-issue.  I have 2 years<br/>
to go & if you consider that you only have to do it once a year, then it is<br/>
almost 3 years away.  A lot can happen in 3 years.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>They send out this post card after you have been homeschooling a couple of <br/>
years.  You send it in also to state how many children are currently enrolled in <br/>
your homeschool.  Not by name but by age and gender.  And yes that is what it <br/>
says.  But it does not say your chances of a visit increase it says you are <br/>
willing to have a home visit.  The Notice of intent says that as well. (that <br/>
you agree to a home visit).  I know people who have sent it in both ways saying <br/>
they will send the info in and not send it in and still don&#39;t know anyone that <br/>
has had a home visit.  This is a voluntary thing to send the info to the <br/>
state.  It says this on the paper.  I guess I figure if I am complying with the <br/>
law then it really doesn&#39;t matter if they visit or not.  <br/>
<br/>
They have three people who work in the NC DNPE and that covers private <br/>
schools as well.  Sometime at the end of the year you will see a notice going around <br/>
from the department asking for volunteers to help file int he office.  I do <br/>
believe that is to help file all that paperwork from the thousands of people <br/>
who chose to voluntary send int he information.  They ask for attendance <br/>
records, and test results.<br/>

it is very easy to do and don&#39;t want any more requirements.  The law is just <br/>
very vague.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But in NC when you fill out your notice of intent it says, and the law <br/>
supports it, that they can make homevisits when they like but do have to give notice <br/>
before coming.  In order to file for your NOI you have to agree to this.  I <br/>
am not saying that you &quot;have&quot; to let them in just if you do not, after you <br/>
agreed to, they might assume, correctly or incorrectly, that you have something to <br/>
hide and will probably take further actions.  <br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t a home inspection, as there are no regulation like for day care or <br/>
private schools, it s just to &quot;review your records&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Now I know some out there choose to not comply based on principal but I am <br/>
not one of them.  I do the minimum to comply so that I do not in any way put my <br/>
boys in jeopardy of any state intervention.<br/>
