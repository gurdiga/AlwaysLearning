<div id="ygrps-yiv-1439557855">Hi Sue,<br/>
<br/>
Wow, what a great talk about Texas. This last weekend at a group campout <br/>
Debbie Z. and I were talking about visiting ya&#39;all in Texas. Tim&#39;s not ready <br/>
for me to go solo all the way with 3 kids. If Debbie and I go together I <br/>
think he&#39;s more likely so say go for it.<br/>
<br/>
We have planned a great not-back-to-school week, complete with a first time <br/>
airplane trip to Disneyland. The kids have asked for many years to go and <br/>
now we will. Ashley will be almost 8, Riley 5 , Tessa nearing 3. Seems <br/>
doable finally.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering about this school idea Ashley has proposed. I&#39;m wondering if <br/>
she asked for a piano teacher I would jump up and get her one. If she asked <br/>
to try rockclimbing, we would pursue that. Now she is asking for a chance to <br/>
see what school is like from the inside. She knows what unschooling is like <br/>
from the inside. She tries to share with her friends that it is like summer <br/>
vacation all the time. Or like Saturday and Sunday everyday. Part of me is <br/>
game for trying school in that she will then know from experience just what <br/>
it is like to sit still, raise her hand, be burdened with homework, miss <br/>
going to great places with the rest of us, reduce her other activities to <br/>
accomodate schooltime.<br/>
<br/>
The other part of me, who knows my daughter really well, feels she may enjoy <br/>
school alot. She may not find it a negative place without freedom. She is <br/>
structured, enjoys adult role models, thrives in doing her best. She likes <br/>
to play test and asks for spelling words, or quiz me about my knowledge. She <br/>
enjoys filling out pages, buys workbooks with her allowance. She may feel I <br/>
need to give her more structure here at home. I would rather be her mom than <br/>
take on a school at home approach. She has been unschooled since I thought <br/>
about her education in utero. I wonder will she come back home? Will she be <br/>
negatively affected from the experience? Will she be swallowed up by her <br/>
peers? Will she increase her dislike for her brother? These are my initial <br/>
questions. Will I like dealing with a teacher telling me the strengths and <br/>
weaknesses of my child. Will I miss her all day?<br/>
<br/>
I love the discussion about spirituality and unschooling. Keep writing <br/>
please.<br/>
<br/>
Deb L. I copied you piece about children and their behavior. I thought hard <br/>
about my family. Why do my children get me so frustrated that I have bad <br/>
behavior? How can I be more gentle on myself. When I put blinders up to <br/>
societies expectations I do so much better loving my children actively. When <br/>
I worry about how they appear, I do things that are not in the kids best <br/>
interest.<br/>
<br/>
As most of you know already, my kids can be pretty hard on eachother. We <br/>
have had a rough 2 years learning about respect and feelings and trying out <br/>
ways to calm down before some one losses it. I am sometimes envious of <br/>
single child families. To be completely one-on-one most of the time, to <br/>
never insist on a young child to be quiet while a baby nurses to sleep, <br/>
every day for 2 plus years. To be able to be hands on most of the time, <br/>
enjoying what that one person is into. My first 2 kids are like night and <br/>
day. What one is into the other is not. I get exhausted trying to meet their <br/>
unique needs.<br/>
<br/>
Talk to you all soon,<br/>
<br/>
Mary<br/>
