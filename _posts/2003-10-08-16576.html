<div id="ygrps-yiv-2030542117">Since I already butted in on Ticia&#39;s post, I thought I&#39;d introduce <br/>
myself. I&#39;m Brandy and we live in Huntington Beach, Ca. We have three <br/>
children. Gavin is five, Avery is three and Marcellus will be one on <br/>
Monday. I&#39;ve been enjoying the discussions on the list, and even <br/>
more...enjoying the way that unschooling is allowing Gavin to explore <br/>
his interests, which at this point are Star Wars and bugs, and Star <br/>
Wars, did I mention Star Wars? I&#39;m looking forward to more great <br/>
insight from this list.<br/>
