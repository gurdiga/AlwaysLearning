&lt;&lt; My kids just started brownies and scouts. They needed to find some friends <br/>
in the area so we decided to give it a go. I didn&#39;t expect that it would be <br/>
for us but we love it so far. Two reasons that we were avoiding the cult :~) <br/>
was that we believed it was too Christian for us and that I&#39;d heard somewhere <br/>
that it was not gay friendly. Generally, I&#39;m not keen on religion as I find <br/>
it divisive in nature and so not spiritual in the way I understand <br/>
spirituality. On the other hand the group promotes all of the qualities that <br/>
make a society inclusive and supportive. Daisy is an elf and elves think of <br/>
others before themselves :~), the sentiment is wonderful. Anyway, I don&#39;t <br/>
know about the gay issue and the boy scouts. We do not want to be involved or <br/>
support anything that&#39;s not gay friendly. What&#39;s your take on this issue, as <br/>
I assume you and Beth are lesbians, and if not you would probably be able to <br/>
answer my question anyway.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, the first thing to keep in mind is that the boys Scouts and Girl Scouts <br/>
are two separate organizations with completely different policies. Girl <br/>
Scouts does NOT discriminate against gay folks, and is not <br/>
Christian/religious the way that Boy Scouts is. Beth has always been out at <br/>
work, and her council has quite a few lesbian staff members.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve never done Boy Scouts for TWO reasons--not only are they gay adverse, <br/>
but they also don&#39;t like Unitarian Universalists, which we are. All in all, <br/>
not a good match for the lesbian UU family.<br/>
